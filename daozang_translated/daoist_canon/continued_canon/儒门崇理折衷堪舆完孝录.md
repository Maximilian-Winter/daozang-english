**The *Rumen Chongli Zhezhong Kanyu Wanxiao Lu*:**

**Scripture Title:** *Rumen Chongli Zhezhong Kanyu Wanxiao Lu* (*The Confucian School’s Veneration of Principle: A Balanced Record of Geomancy and Filial Piety*).
**Author:** Unknown.
**Eight fascicles.**
**Source text:** *Seal-character section* of the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.

**Preface to the *Wanxiao Lu*:**

1. On geomantic landforms (*luan tou*), works such as the *Xuexin Fu* and the *Burial Classic* have already expounded in full. On stellar *qi*, texts like the *Cuiguan Pian* and the *Yuchi Jing* have likewise covered the subject exhaustively. What further need is there for repetition? The entries in this compilation address only what the ancients left unsaid or treated without sufficient detail.

2. All hackneyed doctrines are omitted. However, certain discourses—such as those of the Xiong clan of Guang□, the Li clan of Rao’an, the Ji clan of Kuocang, the Zhou clan of Taihe, and the Wu clan of Linchuan—though grounded in sound principle, have yet to circulate widely. These are thus included in their entirety.

3. On the interplay of form and *qi*, the maxims of earlier worthies may serve as reference. Yet the art of determining fate through the Seven Governors (*qi zheng*) by year and month remains rarely transmitted. For this reason, the present work treats form and *qi* only briefly while elaborating on the Seven Governors. Discussions of form and *qi* retain only contemporary texts, whereas those on the Seven Governors preserve both ancient and modern sources.

4. Heavenly tally marks and the Purple-White system (*tianfu zibai*) elucidate the mechanisms of the Five Movements and Six *Qi*, unveiling the mysteries of the *Luoshu* and *Hetu*. As their principles correspond internally and externally to the Seven Governors, and since such knowledge is seldom transmitted, they are likewise preserved here.

5. The heart of the benevolent and filial knows no ulterior motive in its actions. Yet this compilation frequently speaks of fortune and misfortune, of blessings and calamities—does this not risk misleading the world? Nevertheless, for those of utmost filial devotion who remain undaunted by worldly concerns, these accounts of verification serve to move them. Needless to say, outcomes may not always align with predictions.

6. Geomancy is fundamentally a static art. The ancients, however, often sought dynamism within stillness, hence their frequent reliance on transformation (*bian*). Yet transformation is a matter of expediency (*quan*), and expediency can only be wielded by sages. When mediocre practitioners misuse it, success becomes a rare exception. This work, therefore, confines itself to expounding the constant. As for transformations that verge on the bizarre or arcane, these are excluded entirely.

**Volume One of *The Ruist School’s Veneration of Principle: A Synthesis of Geomancy and Filial Piety***

**Chapter One: On the Orthodox School of Yin and Yang**

Since the existence of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang have been divided, the supreme principle flowing between the two, primordial qi circulating through the ages. In profound obscurity, the wondrous opening and closing of the infinite unfolds; in primal chaos, the divine transformations remain unfathomable. At times, it unfolds as the alternation of the two qi; at others, it spreads as the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases. In waxing and waning, the marvelous work of the mysterious is complete; in fullness and emptiness, nothing lies beyond the workings of creation.

Though the spirits of Heaven and Earth remain unknowable, the patterns of their alternation may yet be examined. The sun and moon, the stars—what shines above follows fixed degrees. Mountains and rivers, earth and stone—what congeals below assumes fixed forms. By deducing these degrees, one may discern the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of years, months, days, and hours; by examining these forms, one may assess the fortune or misfortune of dragon veins, burial sites, surrounding hills, and flowing waters.

The Dao encompasses the Three Ultimates, and principle admits no duality. Only those who unite the Three Powers may grasp the Mandate of Heaven and aid the work of the spirits. As for those rigidly clinging to one-sided views, how could they shoulder great responsibilities? Their lofty discourse and grand strides resemble Yang and Zeng in name only; their sketched diagrams and painted charts offer false comfort, mere trifles. If asked about astronomy or geography, where is their true insight?

To speak of grand matters would be futile, for they fixate on trivial flaws, oblivious to the whole, and cling to partial views. Have they not obscured the distinctions of mountains and rivers in their orientations? They claim to determine fortune and misfortune by direction alone, yet they stray from the sagely canon of seasonal ordinances and further muddle the reckoning of days and hours with杂说. Moreover, the proliferation of spurious texts and the clamor of absurd theories defy the immutable truth: "Heaven has no two suns," an axiom from antiquity to the present.

Those who discourse on the Great Yang speak of calendrical calculations, the Crow and Hare, the Dipper’s handle, and the like, positing seven discordant positions for the sun. Yet the people have no two kings, as the sages have declared. Those who discourse on the Imperial Star speak of the August Emperor, the Celestial Sovereign, the Mouth of the Dipper, and the like, introducing thirteen disparate Imperial Stars.

Those who disrupt yin and yang devise distinctions such as "contending yin," "contending yang," "divided yin," "divided yang," "true yin," "true yang," "prior Heaven," and "posterior Heaven," unaware that the yin and yang of the Supreme Ultimate admit no duality. Those who rearrange the Five Phases invent categories like "yin mansion," "Great Plan," "Eight Trigrams," "Double Mountains," "Mysterious Void," "Tonal Resonance," "Celestial Sphere," and "Stellar Lodges," oblivious that the Five Phases of generation and completion admit no bifurcation.

Such examples are too numerous to enumerate, yet these practices pervade the world. Thus, doubt and belief intertwine, leaving people for generations unable to discern the suitability of burial sites, delaying interment for decades. Only then do they realize that false arts are unworthy of trust; only the sincerity of one’s heart is true. If the master of one’s heart is truly virtuous, people will naturally excel, and the land will naturally be efficacious. Should thoughts and intentions falter even slightly, the land will not shelter, nor will the spirits protect.

Otherwise, why would the head of the dragon vein bring strict calamities within ten days, while the Ox-Sleeping Mountain elevates one to the rank of the Three Dukes? The mechanisms of rise and fall, success and failure, are all decreed by Heaven. Thus, schemes born of greed and deceit are futile, merely exhausting the heart. Some desecrate their own ancestors’ graves, no better than carving flesh to sate hunger; others stealthily bury their dead in others’ burial grounds, no different from stealing a bell while covering one’s ears.

I exhort the world: nothing compares to upholding integrity and cultivating the heart-ground, for this is the root of attaining the land. Following Heaven’s principle is the foundation of geomancy, and loyalty to a true and enlightened master precludes falling for illusory techniques. In assessing landforms, prioritize the Five Stars and mountain contours, while trigrams and celestial patterns are of little consequence. In selecting auspicious dates, emphasize the Seven Governors’ essential principles, while the miscellaneous doctrines of a hundred schools are unworthy of reliance. These are the orthodox principles of yin and yang, through which one may fathom the mysterious workings of creation.

Assessing landforms through the Five Stars and the Four Phrases constitutes the grand essence. Chapter Two: On the Flow and Obstruction of Qi and Fortune

Dragon veins, burial sites, encircling hills, and watercourses pertain to form. Flourishing and decline, waxing and waning pertain to qi. If the form is fundamentally auspicious yet the qi has not arrived, there is no principle by which blessings may be prematurely bestowed—witness how Mount Ni produced Confucius, and Mount Song produced Shen [Shun], for were not these landscapes the same in ancient times? Yet because the qi had not yet arrived, even the workings of creation could not activate their potential ahead of time. If the form is exceedingly auspicious yet the qi has already dissipated, there is likewise no principle by which blessings may be renewed—witness how the Feng clan produced Shun, and the Zhou of Qi produced King Wen, for did the landscapes of later ages differ from those of old? Yet because the qi had already been exhausted, even the workings of creation could not reactivate their potential.

The qi of Heaven and Earth flows without stagnation: ancient Luoyang is not what it once was, while the present capital surpasses its former glory. Though the same mountains and rivers are at work, the timing and duration of blessings vary—whether early or late, near or distant—solely due to the arrival or non-arrival, exhaustion or non-exhaustion of qi. How could one rigidly adhere to inquiries about dragon veins, burial sites, hills, and watercourses?

Yet the mechanisms of flourishing and decline invariably manifest premonitions. Thus, when the Yellow River and Luo River reveal auspicious signs, they foretell the predictions of the *Gua Chou*; when qilin appear in the suburbs, they herald the advent of royal governance; when the Yellow River runs clear, one knows a sage-king will ascend the throne; when the Five Stars converge, they portend the simultaneous rise of worthy scholars. All these relate to the flourishing of the realm and the state. Thus, the quintessential qi of Heaven and Earth manifests as auspicious omens in such ways.

When the qi of fortune is about to wane, monstrosities and calamities proliferate, and inauspicious qi gathers. This qi, vast enough to encompass all, is also subtle enough to permeate the smallest spaces. Even in bustling markets or the sites of residences and tombs, one may speak of flourishing and decline. Whenever entering a region, ascending a residence or tomb, one observes: if birds and beasts thrive, grasses and trees flourish, the climate is mild and warm, valleys radiate brilliance, the earth is deep and fertile, and the scenery is clear and extraordinary—then at dawn, dusk, or midnight, one may witness auspicious lights appearing, pure qi intermingling, and faintly hear the distant sound of bells and drums. The elderly lean on canes, the strong stand tall, children are orderly and bright, and all people live in harmony, courteous and deferential. All these are signs of flourishing qi, and great blessings will surely follow.

But if, upon entering a region or ascending a residence or tomb, one sees grasses and trees withered, birds and beasts scattered, the wind mournful, the atmosphere desolate, mountains and rivers broken and barren, valleys cold and dark—then at dawn, dusk, or midnight, one finds no radiance, only stagnant qi rising, and an eerie silence as if entering an uninhabited land. Households lack elders with gray hair, the young and strong are weak, internal strife arises, and courtyards teem with discord. All these are signs of declining qi, and misfortune will swiftly follow.

There are also those whose homes emit a pale, mournful qi, which invariably foretells mourning attire. If a murky, stagnant black qi arises, it portends epidemics. If a scorching, fiery red qi appears, it foretells fires, legal troubles, or similar disasters. The growth of moss or white filaments, or hens crowing, are all caused by inauspicious qi. Some tombs collapse without cause, their trees uprooted by wind, or struck by lightning—such families will surely decline. If the soil of a tomb is parched, cracked, and exposed, this indicates excessive fire qi, which will attract insects. If only green mugwort grows on a tomb, or white grasses or trees with white leaves appear, this indicates excessive water qi, which will bring forth springs.

Mountains that are large but have small watercourses and lack dragon veins will breed white ants. Mountains that are small but have large watercourses and lack dragon veins will produce springs. Even if the incoming dragon vein is authentic, if the burial site lies in a place devoid of qi, the same misfortunes will follow. If grasses and trees grow all around a tomb yet none grow upon it, white ants will fill the coffin. If only green moss grows on the tomb while nothing grows around it, the burial site will overflow with water. If the site contains sand or stone, water will inevitably seep in. If the site is burdened by killing qi, white ants will also appear. Burying in a hollow will cause water to seep in; burying in hard, unyielding ground will attract ants. These are all inevitable principles, all signs of declining qi.

This outlines the general patterns of flourishing and declining qi. With careful observation, one may delve ever deeper into their subtleties. Today, when people see auspicious omens like lingzhi mushrooms, who does not revere them? Yet distinctions must be made. If a lingzhi’s cap barely emerges, resembling a treasure canopy’s tip peeking out, or if it seems to hum like bees making honey—faintly audible yet silent—this marks the initial flourishing of qi. If the cap is exposed, then the stem appears; if the tip is revealed, then the eaves emerge; if a sound seemed present, now it truly is. Whether red, yellow, crimson, or multicolored in intricate patterns, this is the qi of full flourishing.

When a lingzhi’s stem is exposed beneath its cap, or a treasure canopy’s handle appears beneath its eaves; when its luster fills the eyes or its hum fills the ears—this is the qi of utmost flourishing. Beyond this point, flourishing reaches its peak and begins to wane. If a lingzhi’s stem grows long, or a treasure canopy’s handle rises high; if the buzzing of mosquitoes recedes into the distance, or the rumble of distant thunder ascends from low to high; if auspicious clouds form five-colored patterns that are vibrant outside yet pale within—these are signs of qi about to decline.

When a lingzhi’s stem slants and drifts without touching the earth, or a treasure canopy’s handle rises high yet flutters without support; when the buzzing of mosquitoes recedes into the far distance, or the rumble of faint thunder passes too high; when five-colored patterns scatter and gather unpredictably—these are the qi of true decline. Should the lingzhi or treasure canopy rot and decay; should the once-lofty sound now fall silent; should the distant become remote and the once-vibrant hues suddenly fade; should they drift like fading stars about to disperse or flutter like withered leaves in the wind—these are the qi of utter decline.

For the wise, discernment lies solely in this.

**Chapter Three: On the Nobility and Baseness of Qi and Color**

Master Bu said: "Assessing land is like assessing a person." This is an apt analogy for the method of land inspection. I observe that those who practice physiognomy often judge a person’s nobility or baseness by their form and determine their prosperity or adversity by their qi and color. Only when both are thoroughly examined can the art of physiognomy reveal the truth without deception. Yet why do those who assess land today focus solely on form and neglect qi and color, failing to achieve the same accuracy as in human physiognomy?

Master Fan said: "The ancestral dragon’s high peaks and grand halls are often adorned with clouds of qi." Master Yang said: "Gazing at qi to trace the dragon is easy." Thus, the ancients in assessing land never neglected qi. Why do modern practitioners abandon it entirely?

Yet qi that appears in faint glimmers is especially difficult to discern. Only at dawn, when the clear qi has not yet dispersed; at dusk, when the proper qi is just withdrawing; during the moments when rain has just cleared from both sides; or at the dawn of the Mid-Autumn Festival—at these times, faint traces become visible, and indistinct forms can be observed. Particularly at midnight, recognition is most precise.

All green and red hues belong to yang qi. White and black belong to yin qi. Yellow that is moist and lustrous is the qi of harmonious yin and yang. By observing the height and demeanor of qi, one can divine the length of the dragon vein where it settles; by noting its breadth and scale, one can foretell the abundance of surrounding mountains and waters. If the qi rises straight and upright, the true site must lie in the main dragon vein; if it drifts and slants, the true site must be a branch.

The qi of the main vein is naturally grand and majestic, while that of branches is humble and weak. Mountains that are robust and vigorous possess flourishing qi; those that are soft and frail have faint qi. Thus it is said: "For every ten *li* a dragon travels, its qi rises a *zhang*."

Wealthy graves emit qi like stacked layers, rich in color yet murky. Noble graves emit qi like an unfurled canopy, clear and extraordinary. When it first emerges as a single thread, then forms a floral canopy—lush and verdant, like clouds, like mist, like a banner or imperial regalia draped in yellow, adorned with all five colors—if it coils like a dragon, it is called *wang qi*, the land of emperors. For emperors embody the union of yin and yang, the essence of the five qi, and earth governs rulership; its color is fundamentally yellow, and the dragon symbolizes the sovereign, hence the presence of all five colors, with yellow predominating and resembling the dragon.

When red light shines brilliantly, dense and towering like a forest, like a rainbow, like the moon, like a phoenix in dance, it is called *shu qi*, the land of empresses and consorts. For empresses and consorts are nearly equal to the sovereign in status, and fire aids earth, while the phoenix is the sovereign’s auspicious omen—thus red predominates and resembles the phoenix.

If the qi is white within and yellow without, green in front and purple behind, green like an ox’s head, red like a tiger’s tail, it is the fierce qi of generals and marquises. When it begins like mist and ends like boiling cauldrons, green within and red without, like a shooting star illuminating the earth, like a dragon soaring or a phoenix ascending, it is the *fu xi qi*, the land of good fortune and prime ministers.

A single thread of red and white piercing the sun is the loyal and upright qi of remonstrating ministers. A single thread of red, like a rainbow with faint colors, is the extraordinary literary qi of top scholars. Pure white or pure yellow indicates the land of local officials. Red, yellow, purple, and white intermingled with green and moistness belong to the finest scholars of the imperial academy. Red, yellow, black, and white intermingled with thickness and weight belong to the heroes of the imperial cavalry.

When qi first emerges as a single thread and finally forms a treasure canopy, with all five colors present, light and floating upward, patterned yet uncluttered—like treading in rhythm, like a pagoda, like a waving banner, like a standard or pennant gleaming in the sun and illuminating the stars—it is *yi qi*, the land of immortals. This qi often appears in Flying Goose Dragons and Iron Crutch Dragons.

When all five colors are present, upright and unleaning, like a great minister standing in court, it is *zheng qi*, the land of Daoist scholars. This qi often appears in Upright Dragons and Recluse Dragons.

Generally, qi that is green or red and bright belongs to civil officials; white or black and direct belongs to military officers. Qi that is green, red, white, or black with a thread of yellow and moistness belongs to those accomplished in both civil and military arts. Qi resembling birds produces scholars; qi resembling beasts produces warriors. Qi that is vast and illuminates the sky must yield ministers and generals; qi that is low and small yet luminous also produces civil officials with military readiness.

To know the rank of an official, observe the height and breadth of the qi. To know the duration of an official’s tenure, examine the size and thickness of the qi. To determine the direction of official position and the fate of those it favors, consult the celestial divisions and cardinal directions. If both the life palace and burial site lie in *zi* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Xuanleng* constellation, official positions will often be in Song, benefiting those born in *hai*, *mao*, and *wei*. If both lie in *chou* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Xingji* constellation, official positions will often be in Zheng, benefiting those born in *shen*, *zi*, and *chen*. If both lie in *yin* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Ximu* constellation, official positions will often be in Chu, benefiting those born in *si*, *you*, and *chou*.

If both the life palace and burial site lie in *mao* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Dahuo* constellation, official positions will often be in Zhou, benefiting those born in *yin*, *wu*, and *xu*. If both lie in *chen* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Shouxing* constellation, official positions will often be in Qin, benefiting those born in *hai*, *mao*, and *wei*. If both lie in *si* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Chunwei* constellation, official positions will often be in Jin, benefiting those born in *shen*, *zi*, and *chen*. If both lie in *wu* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Chunhuo* constellation, official positions will often be in Zhao, benefiting those born in *si*, *you*, and *chou*. If both lie in *wei* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Chunshou* constellation, official positions will often be in Lu, benefiting those born in *yin*, *wu*, and *xu*. If both lie in *shen* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Shichen* constellation, official positions will often be in Wei, benefiting those born in *hai*, *mao*, and *wei*. If both lie in *you* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Daliang* constellation, official positions will often be in Qi, benefiting those born in *shen*, *zi*, and *chen*. If both lie in *xu* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Jianglou* constellation, official positions will often be in Wu, benefiting those born in *si*, *you*, and *chou*. If both lie in *hai* and the auspicious qi aligns with the *Juzi* constellation, official positions will often be in Yan, benefiting those born in *yin*, *wu*, and *xu*.

The rise and fall of official positions have no fixed direction, and thus the rotation of auspicious qi likewise has no fixed location. For instance, if the life palace and mountain lie in *zi* while the qi of official nobility appears in *shen*, official positions will often be in Jin. If it sometimes shifts to *chen*, official positions will then be in Zheng. If it further shifts to *wu*, official positions will move to Zhou. Generally, when qi ascends from low to high, from subtle to manifest, it signifies promotion. If it gradually declines and weakens, it foretells demotion. If it transforms into nothingness, it portends dismissal. Moreover, if qi drifts and enters the mountain of the life palace, it signifies retirement and return to one’s hometown. Such variations cannot be fully described; only those of exceptional wisdom and insight can fathom their profound subtleties.

**Chapter Four: On the Authenticity of Qi and Its Colors**

The qi of the earth may be authentic or counterfeit. The counterfeit resembles the authentic, while the authentic may appear counterfeit. In places of great fortune, the qi is extraordinary—steady as a precious canopy, lush as sacred lingzhi. From afar, it casts a visible shadow; up close, it has no tangible form. It may appear red, yellow, purple, crimson, or white with a moist sheen, or black with a luminous glow. It may blend five colors or manifest myriad images—like brocade in the sky or patterns of five hues. These are the auspicious qi of creation concentrated in the earth, their essence and radiance uniquely revealed.

In contrast, some qi appears white or blue, scattered and diffuse, its form distinct yet its essence shallow—likely formed by the interplay of sunlight and water vapor. There are also the dawn qi at sunrise, the rosy qi at sunset, the radiant qi of the moon’s rise and fall, the cloud qi after rain, the damp qi of ancient mountains, the mist qi of rivers and marshes, the luster of pearls in hidden pools, the brilliance of jade within mountains, the floating glow of old cellars, the shimmer of ancient tombs, the converging rays of Yanping that shoot toward the *Douniu* constellation, the blade-like gleam of melon fields bathed in moonlight, the glow of withered plants and aged trees, the fire-like radiance of ancient vessels. Human blood spilled in the wild for long periods emits light at dusk, while the blood of birds and beasts, when accumulated, may also produce flames. The breath of demonic serpents resembles clouds, that of demonic pheasants resembles brocade, and that of demonic tortoises resembles rosy clouds. The breath of clams often forms structures like towers and pavilions. Other phenomena—such as spirit fire, ghost fire, earth lamps, and altar lamps—are too numerous to list, all being counterfeit qi that mimics the authentic.

Generally, authentic qi is broad above and narrow below, while counterfeit qi is narrow above and broad below. Authentic qi is faint outside and dense within; counterfeit qi is dense outside and faint within. Authentic qi is dim outside and bright within; counterfeit qi is bright outside and dim within. Authentic qi possesses both qi and light; counterfeit qi has light but no qi. Authentic qi emerges from mountain peaks; counterfeit qi lingers along mountain slopes. Authentic qi often gathers in bright, open places; counterfeit qi often appears in secluded valleys. Authentic qi frequently manifests where mountains converge; counterfeit qi often arises in solitary yin or yang locations. Without precise discernment, one may mistake a magpie for a phoenix, a crow for a simurgh, or a lizard for a dragon.

As for counterfeit qi, we shall not discuss it further. Regarding authentic qi, there are distinctions between the qi of dragons, burial sites, sand, and water. The qi of ancestral dragons is invariably radiant, illuminating the heavens. The qi within burial sites must reveal a singular, concentrated brilliance. The qi of sand serves to assist the dragon and burial site. Thus, when observing the qi above sand, one must prioritize the qi of the dragon and burial site; one cannot assume that a site is auspicious merely because the qi above the sand is strong. For example, if the dragon and burial site lie in the east and the qi above the sand appears white or red, or if they lie in the south and the qi above the sand appears black or yellow, these are destructive or draining qi—encountering them portends misfortune. Only when the original qi of the dragon and burial site is exceptionally strong can harm be averted. Conversely, if the dragon and burial site lie in the east and the qi above the sand appears black and moist, or if they lie in the south and the qi above the sand appears green and moist, these are highly auspicious signs. Even if the original qi of the dragon and burial site is extremely weak, no disaster will occur.

Generally, destructive or draining qi that falls into a debilitated position brings minor misfortune, while supportive or reinforcing qi that falls into a debilitated position brings only slight fortune. For instance, fire in the north or earth in the east are examples of debilitated positions.

The qi of water shares the same characteristics as the qi of sand.

**Chapter Five: On the Generation and Restriction of the Five Qi**

The qi of spring is green; the qi of summer is red. The pure autumn is white and moist; black resides in winter. The yellow qi flows through the four seasons—all distinct in their nature.

When green qi dominates in fragrant spring, even if white qi appears, it brings no harm. When crimson radiance blazes in summer’s sun, though black qi may arise, there is no need for concern. White in its flourishing need not fear red’s approach; when black prevails, why worry over yellow? Even when earth of the summer season encounters wood, it does not invite disaster. The flourishing yellow qi, meeting green, is not overcome. Observing closely, one sees that when qi is abundant, it fears no restriction; thus, when qi is weak, it naturally cannot generate. The earth of the three springs struggles to aid metal; the white of the nine summers cannot nourish water. Winter’s fire cannot rescue the earth of the late season; autumn’s wood pays no heed to the scorching sovereign. In the four seasons, when water is weak and green-yellow prevails, how can the light, drifting green qi of the east be relied upon, for it despises the white dew? Yet if threads of crimson and purple appear, one may know that a banquet in the Jade Forest will be granted. When tender white qi drifts in the west, it dislikes the arrival of scorching heat. But if faint black qi emerges, success on the battlefield is assured. When faint red fears black and encounters the yellow matchmaker, achievement is imminent. When water is scant and dreads earth, if green and yellow appear, then career success is certain. Though yellow fears wood, white can resolve it; if earth stands alone with green, it may cause ailments of sinew and bone. Single red foretells prison calamity; heavy yellow brings pestilence; solitary white heralds death; a comet in the north, regardless of color, portends unforeseen disaster. There is no need to doubt this—all such signs arise when green, red, yellow, and white lack moisture, and black appears damp, stagnant, and dull. If the qi is balanced and harmonious, what harm can come?

When green qi scatters and loses its proper form, it often gives rise to shamans and sorcerers. When red light pierces sharply with strange anomalies, it surely produces litigious advocates. When white qi emerges chaotically and drifts in disarray, the world transmits tales of cruelty and malice. When black light slants and appears askew, generations suffer from arrow wounds. When yellow appears dim and lightless, it foretells the birth of the blind, deaf, mute, or dumb. When green is disordered, there will be many changes; when black is disordered, there will be much licentiousness; when red is disordered, literary talent fails to blossom; when white is disordered, weapons and warfare will surely arise. Moreover, when yellow qi is disordered, illness follows. Though red and yellow appearing together are generally auspicious, if chaotic red emerges in the west, it will bring blood diseases; if chaotic yellow arises in the north, it will surely cause depletion of vitality. Though green and black may seem inauspicious, if lustrous green appears in the south, its brilliance will only grow; if tender black emerges in the east, it will bring delightful vitality. For within misfortune, fortune may hide, and within fortune, misfortune may lurk—all is the natural mechanism, an immutable principle. When qi is excessively strong, it breeds violence and ferocity; when it is too weak, it leads to loneliness and hardship. Those at the peak of abundance will swiftly meet their end; those at the extreme of weakness will ultimately face extinction. Though the duration may differ, the outcome is the same.

**Chapter Six: On the Mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s Qi**

The preceding chapters discussed qi; the following will address form. In the art of fengshui, one must first recognize the mechanism of qi—without understanding the mechanism of qi, what is fengshui? Qi connects with the heavens and reaches the earth; though it communicates with heaven and penetrates the earth, the two are distinct. Contemporary masters briefly illustrate a few points to instruct our descendants.

Qi may advance and achieve; the mechanism may also advance and achieve. Advancement is auspicious; achievement is even more auspicious. Qi may retreat and decline; the mechanism may also retreat and decline. Retreat is inauspicious; decline is even more inauspicious. Treading upon the dragon, ascending the site, embracing the sand and water, and examining the mechanism of qi—if it advances or achieves, it is a noble land, ensuring honor and prosperity; if it is a rich land, it will lose its flourishing. Even in humble and lowly places, all will be well. If it retreats or declines, it is a poor dragon, foretelling exhaustion; if it is a base dragon, it foretells illness and suffering. Even in wealthy and noble lands, all will come to ruin.

Spring belongs to wood; wood’s qi is green, and wood’s mechanism is ascension. Summer belongs to fire; fire’s qi is red, and fire’s mechanism is blazing. Autumn belongs to metal; metal’s qi is white, and metal’s mechanism is melting. Winter belongs to water; water’s qi is black, and water’s mechanism is sinking. The four seasons belong to earth; earth’s qi is yellow, and earth’s mechanism is congealing.

Gently drifting, misty and pervasive, swaying like flying threads, rustling with a resonant sound—this is the qi of wood. The cry of a crow, the bark of a dog, a green-robed boy carrying a pot and flask—this is the mechanism of wood. In all that is seen or encountered, if it carries the sentiment of movement, the appearance of joy, or the posture of rising, it belongs to wood and is fitting for spring.

Green haze and red light, flying blossoms gathering before the eyes, flickering and flashing, fierce and roaring—this is the qi of fire. The barking of dogs, the crowing of roosters, the shouts of wives and children, the songs and leaps of shepherds and woodcutters—this is the mechanism of fire. In all that is seen or encountered, if it carries the sentiment of surging, the appearance of rage, or the posture of thunderous intensity, it belongs to fire and is fitting for summer.

Clear and white, the color of wind drifting, heard as if sounding yet unseen—this is the qi of metal. Singing while walking, voices responding to voices, driving oxen and herding horses, speaking slowly and moving leisurely—this is the mechanism of metal. In all that is seen or heard, if it carries the sentiment of contemplation, the appearance of weariness, or the posture of satiety, it belongs to metal and is fitting for autumn.

Tranquil and still, without dust or disturbance, unmoving and unshaken, yet not desolate—this is the qi of water. Walking shoulder to shoulder, sitting knee to knee, conversing hand in hand, birds flying without a sound—this is the mechanism of water. In all that is seen or encountered, if it carries the sentiment of sorrow, the appearance of melancholy, or the posture of restraint, it belongs to water and is fitting for winter.

Dust filling the eyes, yellow sand drifting faintly, all sounds silenced, the wind mild and cool—this is the qi of earth. Adjusting one’s clothes and tying one’s shoes, standing upright in refined conversation, shouldering burdens, birds roosting, and beasts returning—this is the mechanism of earth.

In all that is seen or encountered, if it carries an air of solemn dignity, the bearing of bearing burdens, or the posture of deep composure, it belongs to earth and is fitting for all four seasons.

In spring, the mechanism of fire qi brings advancement; wood qi brings fulfillment; water qi brings retreat; and metal qi brings decline. From one, the rest may be known. The earth of the four seasons likewise corresponds to the four times, and by its qi one may judge a man’s descendants and official rank, while by its mechanism one may determine ancestral estates and wealth.

When qi is mixed, a single household may contain several surnames. When qi advances, descendants achieve renown. When qi fulfills, sons are added and ranks promoted. When qi retreats, officials retire and sons fall ill. When qi declines, officials meet disaster and sons die.

When the mechanism is inauspicious, the yang dwelling brings licentious elopement, and the yin tomb likewise brings licentious elopement. When the mechanism advances, production increases and wealth arrives. When it fulfills, granaries are full and storehouses overflow. When it retreats, the household dwindles and empties. When it declines, fields are sold and debts incurred.

Examine the time of the qi mechanism: if it belongs to *yin*, it corresponds to the life of *yin-hai*. If it belongs to *si*, it corresponds to the life of *si-shen*. The rest may be inferred by analogy to determine fortune and predict lifespans.

In the month of *lu-yin*, judge misfortune and predict the time of life’s punishments and calamities—this method is infallible.

In spring, when climbing a mountain, if one sees a rider on horseback: a tomb with stone masonry indicates a family with disorders of the diaphragm or feet; a tomb overgrown with weeds indicates a household of complete wealth and nobility.

In summer, when entering a village and hearing swallows’ calls: if inquiring about illness, one may judge that death will come in autumn; if inquiring about official rank, one may judge that success will come in autumn.

In autumn, when climbing a mountain and seeing someone carrying wine: a tomb with a stele indicates wealth without accumulation; a tomb without a stele indicates frugality with wealth.

In winter, when climbing a mountain and hearing crows: a male tomb indicates that a son will rise to the rank of imperial censor; a female tomb indicates a poor household with filial sons.

At noon, when visiting a tomb and observing the sunlight: if it shines on the west, that direction will prosper; if on the east, that direction will decline.

At noon, when entering a hall and seeing vegetable sellers: it indicates that men and women will lack descendants and lose their spouses in middle age.

All these are judged by the qi mechanism.

**Chapter Seven: On Dragon Lairs, Sand, and Water**

When discussing dragons, one must speak of the "coming dragon." If the dragon’s arrival is not seen, how can one take it as the basis? When discussing lairs, one must speak of "lair sentiment." If the lair’s sentiment is not examined, what can serve as evidence?

Though the branches and trunks of dragons differ, their arrival always displays soaring, hidden leaps, or submerged movements. If even one is lacking, the dragon is not true. Though the forms of lairs vary, their settling always involves sentiment, posture, and qi veins. If even one fails to gather, the lair is not correct.

Where there is a true dragon and a correct lair, auspicious sand remains auspicious, while inauspicious sand will be subdued. It is like a well-ordered court, where even treacherous heroes become pure and good. Water that comes will come, and that which goes will also be put to use. It is like a body free from major illness, where minor ailments are of no concern.

If there is not a single true dragon, its arrival will not endure, and those buried there will be solitary, poor, and destitute. If there is no true lair, its core will be clumsy, and those buried there will suffer from poverty or even extinction. All interactions—whether generating or overcoming—pertain to sand, and all should serve me. Children, fathers, wealth, and officials should all embrace me gently. What embraces me is auspicious; what opposes me is disastrous. Coming and going alike pertain to water, and all should flow leisurely. *Gen*, *bing*, *xun*, and *xin* should all converge gently. Metal, water, and earth are excellent; wood and fire are ominous. Enclosure and pursuit are not sand; crabs and shrimp are not water. One principle determines the dragon; one principle verifies the lair.

Dragons have regular and transformed states; lairs have additions and subtractions. When metal transforms like wood, fire dissolves beside it, and the posture is like a single thread, its nobility is unmatched. When earth forms a lair, the lair desires concealment. When earth transforms like metal, wood arrays between them, and the posture is like a split melon—its wealth is beyond words.

When fire lies in submission, the lair removes its peak. Sand dislikes leaving its homeland but also cherishes leaving it. What is disliked lies in sharpness and erosion, leading to drifting and dissipation. What is cherished lies in roundness and elegance, bringing distant official posts and merchant wealth.

Water should neither be cherished for leaving nor feared for leaving. That which leaves should glance back, beckoning wealth from all directions. That which comes should leap like an arrow—nothing will be harmonious.

*(Note: "穴音纬交覆深屋也" refers to the lair’s sound resembling the intertwining of weft threads, covering a deep chamber.)*

**Chapter Eight: On Dragons**

Fledglings awaiting food—how can they cry while crouching? Puppies rising from obscurity—how can they howl in alleyways? The peak of emerging power—the dragon’s rising ancestor is called the "emerging general," passing through a gorge is called the "passing general," and forming a lair is called the "settling general." How can jagged cliffs be round? The throat-like pass of the lair’s formation—how can it be level?

What of the two qi’s postures? What of the five omens’ movements? Marvelous and fleeting, changing with each step and dividing paths, they advance side by side, hooves and bridles competing in rank. Descending from high to low, attendants scatter in profusion—like a flock of sheep hesitating, like startled birds flapping their wings, like earthworms crawling along furrows, like spider silk tracing eaves, like the veins of silk, like the marks of water.

Their fluttering, single leaves must rush toward one formation; their piled, clustered ranks must follow one surge. Now rising, now falling; now broken, now connected. Posture does not burden form; form does not burden the tomb.

On a refined and elegant ridge, the lair desires ingenuity. On a dense and crowded ridge, the lair desires exclusivity. Faint and subtle, its descent already weak—the lair desires uprightness. Winding and meandering, its posture already horizontal—the lair must spiral.

Where leaves are lush and branches dense, the waist must be knotted. Where leaves are sparse and branches clear, the end may be extended. Thus it is said: when many mountains turn their heads, the lair is at the plain’s head; when many mountains fly and flee, the lair is at the water’s mouth.

Where high and low intercept one another, the lair takes form at the central waist—this may serve as the essential principle for tracking the Dragon, and likewise as the great foundation for locating the tomb.

Thus the Dragon’s movement has hands and feet; the Dragon’s repose has head and face. The Dragon’s offspring are dignified and solemn, turning toward no side; the Dragon’s four faces all regard the Dragon’s spirit.

The Dragon’s progression should mutually engender and harmonize; the Dragon’s strategic passes should mutually restrain and punish. The Dragon’s rise from its ancestor must face its descendants; the Dragon’s arrival at its head must resemble its ancestral line. Ancestral weight and depth yield fine descendants; descendants’ elegance and distinction arise from fine ancestors.

Thus it is said:
When ancestor and lineage are strong, one’s position is well-established, and descendants flourish.
Though the lineage branches, the ancestral virtue remains undiminished, and descendants prosper greatly.
Though the rise to prominence may be modest, the inheritance endures, and renown spreads far.
When the ancestor has passed but the lineage thrives, a generation’s wealth follows.
When ancestor and lineage shine, prosperity spans generations, descendants advance in succession, and the ancestral line endures unbroken.
When the lineage’s descent weakens and the ancestral mountain is delicate, a generation attains modest comfort.
When the lineage’s descent weakens but the ancestral mountain regards it, the tomb brings radiant greatness.
When the ancestor is lost and the lineage forsaken, one’s house is left to others—all because the ancestor abandoned the lineage.

Dragons of the north, south, east, and west in flatlands differ not from those of high mountains. For the Five Stars of high mountains form a solid body, while the Five Stars of flatlands form an external body. Branching, knotting at the throat, opening curtains to release veins—whether moving forward or backward, whether welcoming or sending off—there is no difference.

Yet the northern Dragon’s mountains prevail over water, so it often settles by qi; the southern Dragon’s water prevails over mountains, so it often settles by water.

**Chapter Nine: On the Tomb**

Recently, those of the Zhuan Gate have taken to saying: hollow, pincer, breast, and prominence.
Hollow and pincer are one—hollow is round, while pincer is straight.
Breast and prominence are one—prominence juts upward, while breast hangs down.
Dragons of Metal and Water favor forming hollows and pincers; Dragons of Earth and Wood favor forming breasts and prominences.

A hollow is verified by a bubbling center; without a bubbling center, it is askew or empty—such hollows bring orphanhood, widowhood, and poverty.
A pincer is verified by pierced ears; without pierced ears, it is drifting or scattered—such pincers cause family dispersal and separation.
A breast is verified by following water; without following water, it is withered or exhausted—such breasts bring either poverty or extinction.
A prominence is verified by whiskers and wings; without whiskers and wings, it is solitary and isolated—such prominences bring hardship and ruin.

In high mountains, tombs within prominences favor hollows; in flatlands, tombs within hollows favor prominences. Piercing emptiness or thinness makes the tomb’s nature malign; clamping firmness or suddenness makes the tomb’s nature warm and harmonious.

Borrow from officials, not from ghosts—borrowing from ghosts brings extinction. Borrow from tigers, not from Dragons—borrowing from Dragons brings annihilation. Borrow from tables, not from supports—borrowing from supports makes the household collapse like melting snow. Borrow from mountains, not from water—borrowing from water makes wealth shatter like ice.

**Chapter Ten: On the Sand**

When the main mountain descends, the surrounding mountains must assist, guarding and following like feathers and wings.

Mountains must stand distinct—distinct, then not lost in the crowd, rising above the multitude, peerless among the throng. Yet mountains must not stand alone—alone, then surely solitary, adrift and exiled, with no kin or followers. Mountains must not be too many—too many, then without reliance, like treacherous ministers and rebellious sons forming cliques in every direction. Mountains must be numerous—yet among the many, one must be supreme, arrayed to left and right like attendants and founding meritorious ministers.

Mountains must connect—connected, then they contend. Mountains must interlock—interlocked, then they do not leak. The distinction between a leaking state and one that seals lies in their mutual need and collision. Mountains must not hang low—low, then they lose advantage. Mountains must descend—descending, then their momentum halts. The distinction between hanging and descending lies in whether killing *qi* or vital *qi* prevails.

What is favored is completeness on all four sides; what is feared is dominance on one side alone. Without convergence, the Five *Qi* scatter to the Eight Winds; pressed or submerged, the Three Lights are imprisoned by the Five Agents.

Only when three sides are dense and expansive, accommodating and receptive, with one watercourse level and clear, does it serve to defend and guard. Nobility and baseness are firmly tied to the Rear Dragon; good and ill fortune fully manifest in the frontal opposition.

Like ants in orderly lines, they bind to their target, low and coiled in winding hollows; like bees in swarms, they array themselves along the sides, high and concealed in sheltered basins. Advancing, their momentum seems to clash; retreating, their stance remains reverent. Gathered to left and right as auxiliaries, they tower at the gates to seal the wind.

Like an unfolded screen or a dead city, they harbor no intent to scatter or depart; like a suspended bell or an overturned cauldron, they hold the sentiment of turning toward their source and honoring their lord. Why seek the likeness of banners or flags? And why insist on the form of bamboo shoots or spears?

When the rear trails and the front soars, left encircles and right bows—this is the vastness of mountains restraining the Dragon. When the rear is emaciated and the front disordered, left rebels and right stretches straight—this is the exhaustion of mountains forsaking their source. When branches divide behind and streams divide before, left like a comb’s teeth and right like a fine-toothed comb’s brows—this is mountains abandoning water, their feet uneven. When all behind resemble umbrella ribs and all before like flat boards, left departing like an army on the march and right like a fleeing horde—this is mountains chasing water, their feet branching apart.

Yet to discern the excellence or fault of the *sha* method, first observe the prosperity or decline of the primary lord. If the Wood Star of the primary lord is excessive, it is fitting to see Fire and Metal; if the Wood Star is greatly weakened, it is fitting to see Wood and Water—to bolster its decline, yet also to restrain its excess. From one instance, the rest may be inferred.

**Chapter Eleven: On Water**

Water follows the mountains’ course, mountains mark where water halts;
Water turns with the mountains’ bend, mountains guard against water’s flight.
Men know mountains must not tilt nor lean—who knows water must not overflow nor stagnate?
No sword-hilt streams beneath the armpit, no lopsided chimes flowing past the face,
No breast-dividing currents like a sash, no arm-splitting flows like roof tiles,
No frog-backed trickles, no vulture-chested double cascades.
A zither laid horizontally, its essence akin to an encircling lapel;
A crescent moon, a long rainbow—these bear no likeness to a reversed crossbow.
Six streams converging from the west, the right never hollow;
Six channels flowing eastward, the left never void.
Arriving like an unrolled mat, level and dividing the turbid earth;
Departing like a spread curtain, locked yet discerning the sky’s clarity.
With connections and intersections, without clashes or arrows.
Seeking the dragon’s head, the flowing waters must separate within and without;
Following the form to locate the site, they should return to their dips and descents.
For mountains seek a resting foot—if they stretch on, they sever other affections;
Water loves to encircle the city—if it turns away, it fails to gather inner *qi*.
Thus, first gather before releasing, and cherish lingering after departure.
A *qian* flow should be anchored by a long current, not escaping before the hall;
A minor accumulation meeting a greater one should curve within the wrist.
Though lakes and ponds may gleam clear, their stillness cannot match the intimacy of a goldfish’s gill-shadow.
Level and broad, desire the river’s silence; straight and swift, shun the ditch’s abrupt turns.
Level yet not level, horizontal yet not horizontal—diverging like the character "eight";
Tilted yet not tilted, straight yet not straight—locked like the character "ding."
Where banners wave and crossbows reverse, calamity draws near;
Where lips collapse and flanks press in, disaster arrives.
Long troughs and slanted pipes—within years, the coffers are swept clean;
Lopsided spears and dry cuts—within a generation or two, ancestral rites stand solitary.
Now like a sash, now like silk—each must align with celestial patterns;
Now dark, now deep—each governs its palace’s domain.
Chaotic streams crossing palaces tread clear paths yet trample murky radiance;
Pure and unadulterated, entering the road, they congeal like a green mirror reflecting the azure abyss.
When the primary lord is weak, it is fitting to nurture and support;
When the primary lord is strong, it is fitting to restrain and drain.
Support the weak, temper the strong—all returns to harmony.
When the dragon is true and the site is correct, the water naturally conforms to the method.
*Dǒu* sounds like "gather," *shōu* like "decline," *tā* like "other."
*Líng* sounds like "spirit."

**Chapter Twelve: On the Gorge Position**

Though star peaks must undergo transformation, they must not lose their original spirit. For instance, after the Metal Star alternates, it must reappear as Earth and Metal to retain its fundamental nature.

The discussion on the primary exposure pertains to crossing the gorge. Crossing the gorge resembles the edge of restrained *qi*, yet differs in essence. Restrained *qi* seeks temporary respite to prevent excessive dispersion, while the gorge acts as the pivotal mechanism—like a cicada’s molt or a dragon’s metamorphosis.

When the Metal Dragon crosses the gorge, consider that Metal is the essence of Earth. Water’s mother is born in *sì*, entombed in *chǒu*, nurtured in *chén*, flourishes in *yǒu*, wanes in *jī*, isolates in *guǐ*, clashes in *kòu*, perishes in *yín*, receives emolument in *shēn* and *yǒu*, and attains nobility in *yín* and *wǔ*. Passing from entombment and perishing to birth and flourishing, or from isolation and waning to emolument and nobility, marks an auspicious site. Yet the form traversed must distinguish between orthodox and variant transformations, like the purity of pearl and gold.

If the orthodox form crosses, all protective stars should align with its essence, as if molten gold flows in harmony. If the variant form crosses, all obstructive constellations should adapt to its transformation, making the gorge’s passage extraordinary. Before crossing, take generation as the body; after crossing, take restraint as the function.

For example, in rearing a child: once the skeletal frame matures, one must shed infantile traits to undertake adult responsibilities—hardening sinews, tempering resolve, refining through mutual polishing, to achieve full personhood. Thus, though Fire restrains Metal, Metal is refined by Fire’s passage; though Water restrains Fire, Fire is tempered by Water’s passage; though Wood restrains Earth, Earth is aerated by Wood’s passage; though Metal restrains Wood, Wood is honed by Metal’s passage; though Earth restrains Water, Water is solidified by Earth’s passage.

Observe the gorge’s flanks to discern verdancy or barrenness; its twists and turns to gauge elevation or enclosure; the roc’s form to infer the tomb’s posture; the gorge’s momentum to ascertain the tomb’s validation; its stars to determine the tomb’s hue; its depth or shallowness to measure the tomb’s penetration; its length or brevity to assess the tomb’s lip texture.

Once the gorge is crossed, examine which star emerges as the minor ancestor. If Metal crosses and Metal appears, the dragon is exposed—shield it with Water, so the child protects the mother, preventing her from being overtly revealed, thus preserving dignity. If Metal crosses and Water appears, the dragon is drained—fortify it with Earth to sustain its primordial *qi*. If Metal crosses and Earth appears, the dragon is congested—restrain it with Wood to gradually unveil its splendor. If Metal crosses and Wood appears, the dragon is afflicted—bolster it with Metal to prevent *qi* depletion. If Metal crosses and Fire appears, the dragon is injured—restrain it with Water, drain it with Earth to preserve its essence.

After the ancestral star arises, it must undergo transformation. After one or two transformations, restrain the *qi*. After repeated restraint, raise the summit. The summit star must clearly cross the gorge—if Metal serves as the summit, the dragon’s original spirit reveals its true essence.

Wood and Earth stars may interchange as mother and child. Water and Fire, however, are unsuitable for auspicious sites. When Metal encounters Wood or Fire, wealth and destruction converge. Yet if Metal layers without transformation, Wood and Fire must appear—like establishing a household, which requires wealth for stability and office for prominence.

**Chapter Thirteen: On Form and Momentum**

The incoming mountain embodies momentum. Convergence forms shape; momentum is the root, shape the blossom. When the blossom flourishes, the fruit is firm; when the root runs deep, the trunk thrives.

Momentum must flow—flowing far, its traces soar. Shape must not flow—flowing dissipates, dissipating fails to congeal. Momentum must not halt—halting severs its origin. Shape must halt—like a rooster, it gathers and contains.

Shape must not be exposed—exposure scatters *qi* in fleeting winds. Momentum must be exposed—exposure gathers *qi* at lofty peaks. Momentum must not be sullied—sullied *qi* stagnates and fails to congeal. Shape must be sullied—sullied *qi* gathers and harmonizes.

For shape is the accumulation of momentum, and momentum the exaltation of shape; shape is the convergence of momentum, and momentum the follower of shape. Lateral momentum flanks the center to guard the tomb; frontal momentum faces the tomb to respond to the dragon.

External momentum should be rounded, internal momentum refined. The ancestral dragon’s form resembles a flower’s core; the mounted dragon’s form, a hall’s center. It upholds the central chamber like a calyx, residing within the gate’s defense.

The positioned dragon’s form resembles a reclining person’s *jiānjǐng* or a leaping fish’s fin—adapting to its direction while laterally responding. The tomb of the receiving dragon resembles the heart’s gaze at the sash or the sun and moon’s radiance—tracing its lineage to broadly embrace and conceal, like an aristocratic residence with towering gates, its halls unseen; or a magnanimous host’s hospitality, exuding warmth and reverence.

Like a neglected garden with crumbling fences, it becomes a thoroughfare for the uninitiated; like a venerable elder or powerful official, it must be flanked by formidable guards; like a treasure vault or granary, it must be amply stocked and fortified. Thus it is said: roots coiled and stems firm yield branches flourishing like towering trees; flanks reinforced and streams channeled shape the true dragon.

---

**Chapter Fourteen: On Determining the Tomb Site**

The horizontal pulse determines the tomb site. The horizontal pulse arises where the dragon passes, then submerges at the center—strike where the shuttle’s belly swells. It must have a frontal audience and rear support, with lateral shoulders and hat, to be a true *dǒufǔ*. The perforated pulse often receives at the waist, favoring the dragon’s spine behind the summit.

The text states: "A horizontal pulse that bears and descends—where no dragon appears, its whiskers below may yet conceal a dragon." It must never emerge outward, for emergence severs the *qi*. The vertical pulse determines the tomb site. The vertical pulse arrives straight, neither left nor right; its burial point often risks *qi* leakage, so it must be flanked by layered, clasping shoulders to block the water before interment. If the mountain’s repose is too slack, the site may prove fatal. The text states: "Straight delivery, straight advance—where *qi* gathers, settle; where it scatters, abandon." It must never be aligned head-on, for alignment invites collision and ruin.

The broken pulse determines the tomb site. The broken pulse travels with swollen ends and a constricted center, like lotus roots linked by threads or a silver ingot’s narrowed waist. Identify the site within the slender middle, and if responsive, bury it where the waist receives *qi* in a transverse stance. Without response, the site remains ambiguous—never force it. The leaking pulse determines the tomb site. Beneath great mountains, beside embryonic breath, a faint thread seeps into the plain. If it swells into a mound, this is a *qi*-leaking site; bury at the summit, facing inward.

The stolen pulse determines the tomb site. The stolen pulse lies in flatlands, a grass-snake’s ash-line or tortoise-shell ridge rising from the level ground. Examine its terminus, and bury at the withered spine, ensuring a frontal *mingtang* and rearward water flow for authenticity. The flying pulse determines the tomb site. The flying pulse moves like spider trails or horse tracks, like swallows’ silk or drifting threads, often spiraling obliquely. Choose the center where encircling mountains converge, and bury at the most upright point.

The level pulse determines the tomb site. The level pulse is a plain’s dragon: when surrounding fields stand high and distant, and the approaching land dips into low fields, which then rise again into elevated tracts, the low becomes water, the high the pulse, and the outer heights the dragon and tiger. Observe where waters merge, and bury at the palm’s center. The descending pulse determines the tomb site. The descending pulse flows from lofty heights as a single thread, like a dangling insect or a spider’s suspended web. Bury at the tiny, pearl-like mound, avoiding grand constructions that harm the dragon.

The long pulse determines the tomb site. The long pulse stretches flat and drifts far, now surfacing, now vanishing, now swelling, now shrinking. Bury only where *qi* dissipates and waters converge in the *tang*. The short pulse determines the tomb site. The short pulse halts no true dragon, but at the dragon’s journey, one or two segments descend, or a single vein settles at a gathering point. Bury centrally, avoiding bias—though such sites bring swift rise and swift decline.

The true pulse determines the tomb site. The true pulse advances centrally, winding and supple, its stars aligned and refined. Bury where the facing peaks converge at the center; if the Dark Warrior’s snout extends, it suppresses the site; if its head retracts, it shields it.

**Chapter Fifteen: On Verifying the Tomb Site**

**The Five Stars Verify the Tomb Site.**
For Metal’s form, bury at its hollow where movement stirs; for Wood’s form, bury at its sprouting bud; for Water’s form, bury at its meandering stillness; for Fire’s form, bury at its fading flame; for Earth’s form, bury at its parched thinness.

**The Nine Stars Verify the Tomb Site.**
The Greedy Wolf’s site is the nipple’s tip;
The Great Gate’s site is sought in the hollow’s core;
The Military Arts’ site hides in hairpin clamps;
The Fortune-Star’s teeth carve the helmet’s crown;
The Literary Star’s site lies flat within, or drops from the palm’s high center;
The Breaking Army’s site resembles spear and halberd, gathered at the west’s backhand;
The Auxiliary Star’s site mirrors a swallow’s nest, or a lantern hung on lofty peaks;
The Correcting Star’s site rests in low plains, its rounded head still concave.

**The Three Postures Verify the Tomb Site.**
Upright mountains soar, *qi* ascends;
Reclining mountains lie, *qi* descends;
Seated mountains harmonize, *qi* conceals within—these are Heaven, Earth, and Human postures.

**Facing Mountains Verify the Tomb Site.**
The *an* and *dui* seek resonance, like host and guest in greeting, like husband and wife in intimacy, their intent unbroken, their forms interlocked without retreat. A singular peak strikes true; paired ridges share the embrace. High peaks meet the brows, low peaks meet the heart. Thus it is said: "Only the facing mountain knows the heart’s fortune."

**The Bright Hall Verifies the Tomb Site.**
Where the site coalesces, a small *mingtang* must appear, gathering minor boundary waters within. If the hall is centered, bury slightly left; if the site leans left, bury right; if right, the hall’s aid lies there. The site resembles a tray holding cups, or bundled feet—never a lopsided hall.

**Water’s Flow Verifies the Tomb Site.**
Where the site forms, water must curve and pool, still as if unmoving. The text states: "Water bends without chaos—if it gathers left, the site leans left; if right, the site leans right." It also says: "Left water clear, lean left; right water clear, lean right. Facing water should be high; flowing water should be low." For water is the dragon’s blood and pulse: mountains move, water follows; waters merge, mountains rest. Thus the site is marked by water.

**The Joyous Mountain Verifies the Tomb Site.**
The dragon’s path winds, its site often misaligned. The peak behind the tomb star must birth a joyous mountain—whether from its own range or another—so long as it stands behind the burial point as a response. Straight arrivals favor rear seating; ancestral ranges favor lateral alignment. A joyous star misaligned with the site is not true.

**The Ghost and Official Verify the Tomb Site.**
A lateral arrival demands a ghost; a straight descent meets an official. Behind the site, trailing peaks are ghosts, also serving as support; ahead, trailing peaks are officials, also serving as *an*. With these two mountains, the site must sit upon the ghost and face the official—without this, it is not a true site.

**The Dragon and Tiger Verify the Tomb Site.**
The dragon opposes water, the site clings to the dragon;
The tiger opposes water, the site clings to the tiger;
A leftward lift leans on the dragon, a rightward lift on the tiger.
High dragon, high site; low dragon, low site; mid-level dragon, mid-level site.

If the site is low while the dragon and tiger are high, avoid compressing the tomb; if the site is high while the dragon and tiger are low, avoid exposing the burial chamber. Thus, examining the dragon and tiger can also reveal the nature of the site.

**The Ten Paths Verify the Tomb Site.**
The Ten Paths derive from the Four Directions, requiring front and back to align, left and right to balance. The seat should not be skewed, the *an* should not slant, and the flanking "ears" should neither advance nor retreat. When establishing the site, first observe the intersecting "piercing gaze" of the cross, then ensure the rear is rounded and the front is pointed—when left and right align with the gaze, it is called: *"The Celestial Heart’s Ten Paths, Mouth Holding a Bit."*

**Convergence and Divergence Verify the Tomb Site.**
Above, divergence clarifies the arrival; below, convergence confirms the residence as true. This is the inner *mingtang* where waters converge, akin to the "shrimp-whisker" and "goldfish-boundary" juncture. A site with convergence but no divergence has an unclear origin; one with divergence but no convergence has an unstable residence—it is a false site.

**Radiant Qi Verifies the Tomb Site.**
When the dragon and tiger’s outer elbows brim with flourishing *qi*, it forms radiance, which can also verify the site. Radiance on the left places the site to the left; radiance on the right places it to the right; radiance on both sides centers the site between them. Long and clear radiance denotes nobility; short and clustered radiance is most potent. Only when the dragon’s pulse is exhausted do such rare configurations appear in early or middle stages.

**Direction and Corner Verify the Tomb Site.**
While each form can verify direction and corner individually, they may also verify collectively. If the site forms at the center where paths intersect, use the convergence of two waters to confirm it. If the site forms where water flows horizontally across level ground, use the dragon’s distinct *qi* pulse to confirm it. If the site forms where the pulse and water compete, use the intent of the facing mountains to confirm it. For sites forming beside the main or back pulse, use the balance of left and right to confirm. For sites forming where dragon and tiger offer partial protection, use the grandeur of the *tang qi* to confirm. For ambiguous sites on flat or convex terrain, use wide sands and embracing waters to confirm. Generally, verifying a site involves multiple methods, all hinging on its *qing* (affinity) and *shi* (configuration). If the affinity is genuine, even a single verification suffices; if affinity is lacking, even multiple verifications cannot guarantee completeness—this depends on the practitioner’s own insight.

**Chapter Sixteen: On Stellar Qi**
Master Tao states: The highest methods are rarely complete, making true dragons difficult to discern and true sites hard to clarify. Some flourishing *qi* follows mountain contours, and identifying its star reveals its *qi*—this is easily distinguished. When stars array behind the *qi*, they spread before the peaks; when *qi* leans left, stars spread right. In such cases, grasping the star means losing the *qi*, and grasping the *qi* means neglecting the star. Hence, it is said: recognizing *qi* is difficult. Generally, dragons gather *qi*, and stars assist in anchoring it. The adept recognize *qi* without losing sight of the stars; the inept grasp the stars but miss the *qi*—this is the natural principle. Yet at the "clam’s waist" or "crane’s knee," examining the transition reveals the true arrival; at plump, rounded, or level convergences, discerning the dimple clarifies the formation. Extending this logic ensures infallibility.

**Chapter Seventeen: On the Ultimate Halo**
In geomancy, the *ji* (ultimate) and *yun* (halo) are paramount. Every path has its *ji*, every star its *yun*; without *ji* or *yun*, wealth and nobility are unattainable. Earth is the *ji* of Metal; Water, Wood, and Fire are its *yun*. The *ji* is the primordial *qi*; the *yun* is the functional spirit. The *ji* neither advances nor retreats, shimmering like a parent’s tender care. The *yun* neither urges nor bows, clinging like a mutual gaze in a portrait.

When a Metal dragon crosses a gorge, the Earth star subtly reveals its signs, and the *zi* (child), *fu* (father), *cai* (wealth), and *guan* (official) stars array in orderly succession. As it crosses the gorge and ascends to its origin, the Earth star shines from afar, while Water, Metal, Earth, and Wood cluster closely behind. When *qi* is bound with Earth concealing Metal, the father’s primordial *qi* guards and nurtures the dragon. When Metal carries Earth, the *cai* (wealth) and *gui* (ghost) stars escort the emerging *guan* (official), or wealth hides while the *zi* (child) star assumes a dignified stance—this is the *zheng yun* (proper halo). The *zheng yun* bestows enduring rank and eminence, producing governors and ministers. When the *guan* (official) star bows and wealth surges while the *zi* (child) star dominates, it is the *bian yun* (transformative halo). The *bian yun* confers fierce authority, producing censors and generals.

A dragon without the *ji* is like a cinnamon tree without roots—even with one *yi* or two *jia*, it will not yield a top scholar’s son. A *tang qi* without the *ji* is like gold without seed—even with civil and military aides, ascending to the halls of ministers is difficult. When the *ji* appears with the *yun*, the dragon’s pattern and phoenix’s decree are dignified and serene; when the *yun* appears with the *ji*, the purple chambers and vermilion gates shrink in awe. At the burial site, if the *ji* resides in the supporting *tuo*, it may become a screen or barrier of honor. In the *mingtang*, if the *yun* arrays like officials, the birds must adopt a formation like a court assembly.

If the *ji* lies hidden among the sands, its edges remain concealed, while the *yun* flows subtly. If the *ji* is concealed in the water’s curves, its sources and branches intertwine, and the *yun* spreads abundantly. If the *ji* and *yun* of the dragon and site are incomplete, disaster may befall the noble clans. If the *ji* and *yun* of the sands and waters are deficient, misfortune may spread among the people. A *ji* with flaws cannot produce filial sons or loyal ministers; a *yun* with deviations cannot speak of governing the state or aiding the world.

Each *ji* has its place, and every direction should reveal its *ji*. If seized by wealth, it becomes a greedy *ji*; if seized by the child, a weak *ji*; if seized by the official, a contentious one. If I suppress it, it becomes especially glorious for the ancestors. Each *yun* has its position, and each position has its proper alignment. The *guan yun*’s position should be sparse; the *cai yun*’s position should be concealed; the *zi yun*’s position should be upright. Any misalignment becomes a source of calamity.

If all four *yun* are complete within the *mingtang*, the occupant will pass the imperial exams in youth. If all four *yun* are present at the water’s mouth, the occupant will achieve scholarly success in later years. For great wealth, the *cai yun* must remain upright and properly positioned—wealth does not arrive suddenly but accumulates like pearls or stacks of silk, eventually filling thousands of granaries. For great nobility, the *guan yun* must be sparse and occupy the proper direction—nobility does not come abruptly but requires refinement and perseverance before one’s name is renowned. Thus it is said: what I overcome is wealth; what overcomes me is the official. Those who fail to recognize this must proceed with caution.

**Chapter Eighteen: On the Four Spirit Stars**

The land’s hundred forms share a single principle—trace the lineage to its origin, and the shadow reveals the shape. The gorge position corresponds to the public position; the rear ghost responds to the front official. The incoming *qi* follows the residual *qi*; the parted lapels match the joined lapels. Behind lies support, ahead a protective lip; the arrival shows swaying, the dwelling presents a face. The dragon’s whiskers charm the tiger, and the tiger must be tamed by the dragon. Most detestable is a dragon jagged like a tiger; most beloved, a tiger supple as a dragon. A tiger supple as a dragon brings no punishment and fills one’s coffers with wealth. A dragon jagged like a tiger harms the strong and depletes the treasury. The Vermilion and Mysterious Stars, with their father the Azure-White, govern wealth and office—flanked by no hollows, they ensure both prosperity and nobility. Ghosts dislike ghosts, yet officials favor them; falls are ill-suited to falls, but radiance must appear in radiance. To treat a ghost as a ghost is to invite thieving *qi*, leaving the household desolate and descendants few. To treat an official as an official fears no sharp peaks, for it nurtures men of distinction, grand estates, and top scholars. Ghosts dislike ghosts and also dislike sons; only when the father and elder brother’s wealth star aligns is it properly placed. Officials suit officials and also suit wealth and father—Wood and Fire, these two stars, are most favored by Heaven. To fall into a fall is to weaken one’s position, rendering one’s presence as if absent, the household dwindling. To radiate in radiance is to possess a striking form; if it is a noble dragon, one attains high office. Of harmful ghosts, ten or fifteen out of sixteen exist—wherever officials and radiance appear, all become blessings. Great wealth and nobility require clear distinctions: one cherishes only wealth and office that possess *qi* and sentiment. A noble dragon without an official’s momentum is not noble; without wealth’s embrace, it is also not noble. A wealthy dragon without wealth’s momentum is not wealthy; without an official’s embrace, it is also not wealthy. For wealth and nobility are intertwined, and wealth and office guard each other. Wealth unseen by office does not flourish; office unseen by wealth does not protect. When the master speaks, the gates open and the doors close. If the gate opens without a screen, the eldest branch declines. If the door closes without submission, the youngest child turns rebellious. The hall calls for an unobstructed *mingtang*—level, upright, and full of sentiment, which is most auspicious. Whether encircling or unlocking, width is immeasurable: broad expanses leak *qi*, while narrow confines gather sentiment. The water’s mouth shaped like a gourd makes the master laugh, yet without examining the stars and peaks, one vainly praises the ornamental pillar. If one encounters descendants like Tao Zhu, all is desolate—only when the brush and seal are solemn, and the water departs, does nobility arise. Granaries born against the flow gather wealth as water leaves; without crane’s claws in the sand, literary scholars are few. Crane’s claws that do not grasp instead become sordid; without ox horns in the sand, one ends in desolation. Ox horns that do not open instead yield fine returns. Without cicada wings in the sand, the tomb’s sentiment is unclear; cicada wings swollen with congestion leave men bewildered. The summit loves a central perforation, and the perforation loves its mystery. Without this mystery, it becomes a dead eel; branches suffering stem clashes—what boast of a proper descent? To be afflicted at the tomb is to face certain ruin; even with a water city, there will be many breaches. Masters who fail to recognize this, coveting locks and seals, turn *qi*-restraining dragons and water into prisons. Without a pardon, young women and children are bound in fetters. This is a secret transmission—only through keen insight can one attain it.

**Chapter Nineteen: On Left and Right Court Alignments**

Within the gate, a gentleman naturally attracts fine guests; outside the gate, few fine guests suggest an unworthy host. A tiled gate harbors bandits, bringing a hundred misfortunes; if the lock and key are not secure, flying disasters arrive from all directions. A desk for swift reports differs little from one for exiles; a mountain of weeping children is no different from one of prodigies. The form of dancing sleeves resembles parting from one’s homeland; the shape of a prison is like a granary. Within a hundred paces north and south, no towering desk should rise—once every sixty years, it sweeps clean as an empty void. To lift one’s gaze and see a high peak is to endure a hundred thousand years of unending sorrow. Thus it is said: when the *mingtang* opens toward *wu* and *zi*, the elderly grow despondent; when the door closes toward *you* and *mao*, the young lack vigor. Passing the imperial exams and achieving top honors require the Three Harmonies; the Fire Star accumulates jade and piles gold, but only with water channels in all eight directions. A mounted noble may yet be a thief peeking from concealment; a companion in the tent may be a mountain announcing edicts. A swaying writing brush ages one into a scholar; a gaunt jade zither sends one wandering in all directions. Before the ancestral tomb, facing it brings fortune, turning away brings misfortune—yet a crude, inferior corpse tiger returns. Civil brings misfortune, martial brings fortune—further examine merit and achievement. When dragon and tomb are complete, the Water, Fire, and Earth Stars all yield fine *yuanchen* prospects. *Zi*, wealth, and office positions become calamitous dragons embracing tigers; tigers embracing dragons all follow water’s judgment. Right shooting left, left shooting right—all derive from the hall’s division. A mountain standing alone and bowing low subdues a thousand officials; water arriving from afar and settling clear multiplies wealth by ten thousand acres. Among chaotic mountains, only one position faces the tomb directly—naturally, ten thousand tributaries branch forth. Only the half-mirror facing the hall settles decisively: the household’s wealth and nobility are assured, yet kinship’s glory is difficult. When water ends and mountains exhaust, one must seek peaks that accompany and honor; among many scattered graves, only the kneeling, sleeping form is beloved.

**Chapter Twenty: On the Body’s Compass**

For a straight dragon, observe the transformations of its brain; for a horizontal dragon, seek the forms of its support. With brain *qi* and support in place, there naturally exists upper division and lower union—between division and union, Heaven and Earth create the design. A grandson who does not resemble his ancestor is called *su*; *su* does not produce men of letters. A son who does not support his mother is called *lou*; *lou* is difficult to cultivate as a root of wealth and nobility. Among brothers, whether weak or strong, what matters is no clash and no affliction. Between host and guest, whether near or far, what matters is harmony and mutual generation. Among servants, whether many or few, what matters is no star that rebels against the master. Among gates and doors, whether wide or narrow, what matters is a constellation that guards the entrance. Among mountains, whether front, back, left, or right, what matters is alignment with the stars, with no head seen flying and no feet seen fleeing. Among waters, whether coming or going, clear or flowing, what matters is alignment with the directions, with no incoming clashes and no departing cuts. Gathered *qi* should be round and striving; the two sides must not leak. Leakage weakens the traveling dragon; passing through a gorge should be warm and harmonious, with no dispersion on either side. Dispersion leaves the tomb without sentiment. Better to borrow a resting chariot’s host as a guest than to mistake a resting guest for the host.

Better to draw upon the primal spirit’s waters for wealth than to summon the Yellow Springs’ waters for nobility.

Though ancestors may be fine, after five or six generations their merit fades. Though retainers may be many, after five or six generations they scatter.

A dragon fleeing or tiger soaring matters little if the water city enfolds it; a broad hall and distant desk matter little if the dragon’s power is not lofty.

Land that hastens office requires devotion to the emolument star; a noble tomb that brings fortune must welcome *qi* from the dragon.

Spirit, palace, and killing stars in the same village—though but a hair’s breadth apart—may bring either calamity or blessing. A jade eave but a foot away—with a single touch—may bring either fortune or disaster.

Star peaks in orderly ranks, though marred by one or two minor flaws, remain auspicious land. Ghostly obstructions layered thick, though a single mountain or stream may seem promising, do not make a fine city.

Water loves curves, not straightness: straight departure is surely inauspicious, while straight approach must still guard against clashing arrows. Tributaries love arrival, not departure: long outflow is unpropitious, while short outflow is but a fragmented branch.

Water clear and mountains bright—reliable and absorbable—are full of power. Mountains howling and waters weeping—unseen and unheard—are no cause for concern.

A dragon that does not unfurl its screen or array its canopy boasts in vain of powdered beauties and floral charms. A tomb without rear ghosts or front officials, though adorned with towers and drums, is but an empty display.

Literary brilliance unmatched yet failing the imperial exams stems from blurred brush imprints. Descendants’ wealth and nobility, though not numerous, arise from shallow green-felt lips.

Where water departs, a single gleaming stone exerts a thousand *jun* of force. When arrows arrive, a mere ladle of *xun* water holds ten thousand *yi* of sentiment.

The main dragon’s fortune comes late but endures, thus generals arise from generals’ houses, and ministers from ministers’ houses. The side dragon’s fortune comes swiftly but fades, thus one moment thunders forth, the next crumbles to ash.

**Chapter Twenty-One: On True and False Manifestations**

Dragon caves are easy to recognize, but discerning true from false is difficult. The true is often unrefined, the false often wondrous.

The true resembles a virtuous woman behind her curtain, solemn in her procession, with no sidelong glances or mixed inkstones. The false resembles a wanton woman with exposed face and bared head, brimming with chaotic, darting gazes.

The true resembles an imperial procession—though adorned with towers, drums, and horns—hands clasped and head bowed. The false resembles a prodigal son—though surrounded by floral charms and powdered beauties—racing west and chasing east.

A mountain head large yet crooked and fleeing is a false mountain. Sand feet numerous yet embracing backward are false sands.

A tomb site isolated and desolate, with no ear-piercing peaks, no brain-shielding pillows, no yang-lip cushions, and no yin-beard wings, is a false tomb.

A water city winding yet misaligned with directions, clashing arrows subtly approaching, appearing meandering up close but crude from afar, is false water.

True dragons may be pierced through, but false dragons are also pierced through. True dragons may be shielded, but false dragons are also shielded.

Pierced without root is often a dry dragon’s stray guest. Shielded without enclosure is half a scattered remnant of banditry.

Great falsehoods bring great misfortune over time; small falsehoods bring minor prosperity over time.

Tangled and clinging, ten out of ten are rarely genuine. Concealed and elusive, ten thousand out of ten thousand bear false appearances.

The vulgar eye points to a gray line beside which father and son coexist as true. The contemporary master, enamored of silk traces, sees official fortune and wealth as false.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: On Restraint**

Land without restraint leaves the dragon spirit adrift; with restraint firmly in place, wealth and nobility are both complete.

A mountain of restraint bears a dignified and solemn aura: it is not a ghost behind, not an official ahead, not a dragon to the left, nor a tiger to the right.

The restraint of imperial and royal capitals lies a hundred or two hundred *li* away. The restraint of official families and scholarly clans lies between ten and twenty *li*.

A father as restraint—rooted deep—brings generations of official caps. A son as restraint—suddenly flourishing—spreads mighty renown far and wide. Wealth as restraint fills granaries and brings imperial grain tribute. Office as restraint ascends the imperial exams and produces generals and ministers. An elder brother as restraint brings balanced power and shared glory.

Restraint of the Metal Star is surely soaring like a cauldron or bell, while the Fire Star fades nearby. Restraint of the Wood Star is surely towering like a halberd or spear, while the Metal Star yields below. Restraint of the Water Star is surely swelling like a flood, unmoving and unshaken, while the Earth Star circles low. Restraint of the Fire Star is surely blazing like flames, neither flying nor fleeing, while the Water Star lurks hidden. Restraint of the Earth Star is surely level with the heavens, neither pointed nor emaciated, while the Water Star retreats low.

Restraint encountering office, though steeped in poetry and ritual, may still bring lawsuits and prisons. Restraint meeting a father fosters filial piety and brotherly love yet risks displacement and danger. Restraint meeting a son brings many heroes yet may see them wither in their prime. Restraint meeting wealth brings abundance yet may leave the wife’s palace desolate. Restraint meeting an elder brother divides households and sparks rivalry.

Only a mountain standing alone, with no peers beside it and all stars yielding below, brings a household of solemn dignity and ten thousand blessings.

If the dragon comes from the left, restraint lies to the right, as if tempered on the left. If the dragon comes from the right, restraint lies to the left, as if tempered on the right. If the dragon comes from behind, restraint lies ahead, as if guarding the rear.

Where the dragon arrives, restraint beyond several layers of dragon and tiger is marvelous. Where the dragon departs, restraint within the water’s mouth and gate is sublime.

Restraint arising from the land of birth and prosperity brings a century of spring; restraint arising from the land of burial and decay leaves seventy years rare.

Within the water’s mouth, the suburbs serve as attendants, manifesting the Dark Warrior’s arm—this is a fortress of governance. When the great form and configuration overlook not a single mountain or stream, the master’s discerning eye seeks restraint first.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: On Intersection**

To judge fortune like tallying tokens, one must know intersection. The secret says: *Fengshui* without intersection brings no wealth like Tao Zhu, no nobility like the Three Dukes, no longevity like Peng Zu, no harmonious couples, only orphaned and widowed households.

Thus, a dragon without intersection is called "jealous"—its jealousy brings no century of fortune. A tomb without intersection is called "chronic"—its chronicity brings no decade of blessing. Sands without intersection are called "squalid"—their squalor leaves descendants without emolument. Waters without intersection are called "fragmented"—their fragmentation scatters households.

**Chapter Twenty-Three (Continued): On Intersection**

From the pass to the lesser ancestor marks the *dragon’s intersection*—if a Metal Dragon fails to receive Water’s protection, it is called "child-jealousy," and how can one hope for three or five prosperous generations? If a Water Dragon fails to receive Metal’s regard, it is called "father-jealousy," and white-haired elders will surely not fill the household. If a Metal Dragon fails to receive Wood’s support, it is called "wealth-jealousy," and daily sustenance will ever be hard to secure. If a Wood Dragon fails to receive Metal’s aid, it is called "office-jealousy," and literary talent will not ascend the azure path. If a Metal Dragon fails to receive Metal’s protection, it is called "elder-brother-jealousy," and one will toil alone to uphold the family.

From the ghost’s rise to the lip’s mat marks the *tomb’s intersection*—if a Metal tomb fails to encounter Wood, it is called "wealth-chronicity," and how can one boast of granaries in every quarter? If a Metal tomb fails to encounter Metal, it is called "elder-brother-madness," and envy not the dragon spirits’ many flanking aids. If a Metal tomb fails to encounter Fire, it is called "office-madness," and how can one speak of manifold literary stars’ assistance? If a Metal tomb fails to encounter Earth, it is called "father-madness," and surely the hall will lack uncles and aunts. If a Metal tomb fails to encounter Water, it is called "child-madness," and orphans and widows will often appear.

From the following dragon to the gate marks the *water’s intersection*—if a Metal tomb has Water as its city, this is called "child," and fragmentation ensures ancestral wealth will never be abundant. If a Metal tomb has Wood as its city, this is called "wealth," and fragmentation means daily toil with pecks and bushels. If a Metal city has Water, this is called "office," and fragmentation leaves one white-haired yet still poring over texts. If a Metal tomb has a Metal city, this is called "elder-brother," and fragmentation brings constant strife, like tigers battling within the walls.

From the green left to the white right marks the *sand’s intersection*—if a Metal Dragon’s waters layer upon layer, this is called "child," and squalor means frequent births but slow growth. If a Water Dragon’s Metals surge, this is called "father," and squalor brings discord between stepfathers and stepmothers. If a Metal Dragon’s Woods flow abundantly, this is called "wealth," and squalor scatters gains as soon as they are gathered. If a Wood Dragon’s Metals stand in rows, this is called "office," and squalor keeps reputation and rank ever lowly. If a Metal Dragon’s Metals blaze, this is called "elder-brother," and squalor leaves siblings equal in talent but unequal in fortune.

Thus, the dragon and tomb’s intersection is judged by visible *forceful sands*, while the water’s intersection is judged by visible *taboos*. This secret lies in heartfelt realization—it cannot be transmitted in a single breath.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: On the Five Phases’ Generation and Conquest**

The essence of *fengshui* is governed by the Five Phases, and their handle of power lies in generation and conquest. Generation is surely beloved, yet there is generation one ought not to love. Conquest is surely detestable, yet there is conquest one ought not to detest.

The forms of generation are five: first, *flying and crouching*; second, *resonance and response*; third, *sequence and reversal*; fourth, *masculine and feminine*; fifth, *reclining, sitting, and standing*—these are the modes of generation.

Heaven-bestowed Metal generates Water as *flying generation*; Lesser Yin Metal generates Water as *crouching generation*. Flying generation fears haste, crouching generation fears strength—generation that is hasty or overbearing breeds households of discord. A Metal tomb with a Water desk is *resonant generation*; a Metal tomb with an Earth desk is *responsive generation*. Resonant generation favors proximity, responsive generation favors prominence—without proximity or prominence, wealth and nobility will not be attained. Metal peaks eroding Water is *sequential generation*; Metal peaks eroding Earth is *reversed generation*. Sequential generation loves refinement, reversed generation loves clustering—without refinement or clustering, outstanding talent will not flourish. Left Metal and right Water is *masculine generation*; right Metal and left Water is *feminine generation*. Masculine generation favors prostration, feminine generation favors elevation—without prostration, flesh and blood turn against one another; without elevation, the household’s path goes awry. Generation from the proper form is called *sitting*; from the brain, *reclining*; from the face, *standing*. Sitting generation favors uprightness, reclining generation favors attachment, standing generation favors levelness—without uprightness, attachment, or levelness, early deaths and late lamentations will follow.

The forms of conquest among the Five Phases are also five: first, *strength and weakness*; second, *presence and absence*; third, *affection and fear*; fourth, *manifest and hidden*; fifth, *self and other*—these are the modes of conquest.

Heaven-bestowed Metal, residing in the *geng-shen* and *xin-you* directions to conquer Wood stars, is *strong conquest*. Lesser Yin Metal, emerging from the *bing-ding*, *si-wu* directions to conquer Wood stars, is *weak conquest*. Strong conquering strong or weak conquering weak is *slaughter*; strong conquering weak or weak conquering strong is *subjugation*. If a Fire star directly strikes a Metal tomb while ghostly omens and avian constellations are all Water stars, and no Earth star restrains the Water, then conquest exists as if it did not. If a proper Metal Dragon has no Fire star’s encroachment and Wood stars cluster densely, yet solitary Metal cannot restrain them, then conquest does not exist as if it did. Conquest that exists as if it did not brings lofty rank and might; conquest that does not exist as if it did brings repeated injuries. If a Metal star enters the hand with true sharpness, jealousy is *manifest conquest*; if glaring Fire stars flank and escort the Metal Dragon to the tomb, this is *hidden conquest*. Manifest conquest brings overt calamity; hidden conquest brings covert harm. If a concealed Metal Dragon bears Fire stars pressing upon the master, this is *self-conquest*; if an external mountain towers with Fire stars as rivals, this is *other-conquest*. Other-conquest brings strife among the village; self-conquest brings discord among kin. Malevolent stars and ominous omens, like jealousy, *lian-zhen*, and true sharpness, rejoice at the sight of Water stars—this is *affectionate conquest*. Auspicious stars in their proper places, like Metal in the *dui* position, dread the sight of Fire stars—this is *fearful conquest*. Affectionate conquest that conquers brings no small fortune; fearful conquest that conquers brings unending misfortune.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: On the Three Harmonies**

If the dragon does not harmonize with the tomb, the dragon is not true; if the tomb does not harmonize with the water, the tomb is not proper. For instance, if a Wood Dragon arises in *hai*, the tomb in *mao*, and the water flows to *wei*, then myriad blessings will follow. For the water’s source should favor generation and flourishing, while its outlet should favor repose and extinction. Thus it is said: the gate and door must not be occupied by descendants.

Without the Three Harmonies, water’s fortune will not prosper; without the Three Harmonies, fire’s nobility will not shine; without the Three Harmonies, the dragon’s *qi* will not accumulate; without the Three Harmonies, the tomb’s affinity will not gather; without the Three Harmonies, the sands’ force will not be upright. The mark of a land of wealth and nobility lies herein.

Diviners have proposed a theory of "false Three Harmonies" to prognosticate fortune and misfortune—this is entirely mistaken. When the dragon’s arising aligns with its proper direction, this is the Celestial Harmony; when the tomb’s formation rides the phase of generation, this is the Human Harmony; when the water rides the phase of flourishing, this is the Earthly Harmony—these are the Three Harmonies of the dragon. For instance, when the *gui* sits in *xuan*, this is the Rear Harmony; when the office refines in *ming*, this is the Front Harmony; when the luminaries unfold to the side, this is the Side Harmony—these are the Three Harmonies of the tomb. First, not clashing with the dragon is the Coming Harmony; second, not opposing the tomb is the Halting Harmony; third, not following the water’s flow is the Departing Harmony—these are the Three Harmonies of the sands. When the source comes from generation and nurturance, this is the Source Harmony; when it pours into the office of flourishing, this is the Pouring Harmony; when it departs toward extinction and repose, this is the Flowing Harmony—these are the Three Harmonies of water. When dragon and tiger blend as one, this is the Ear Harmony; when the Eight Characters evenly pour, this is the Elbow Harmony; when the shrimp’s whiskers branch in parallel, this is the Fluid Harmony—these too are the Three Harmonies of water. For example, when the true case lies in *wu* and a graceful peak arises, this is the Harmony of Heaven and Earth; when a peak responds on *yin*, this is the Harmony of Sun and Moon; when a peak shines on *xu*, this is the Harmony of Wind and Cloud—these are the Three Harmonies of fire.

A single harmony ensures no dispersion, no extinction; a double harmony ensures no poverty, no lowliness; a complete harmony brings great wealth and high nobility. Yet this may be encountered but not sought. Generally, when land possesses complete harmony, the gorge will have angular regard; when the gorge has angular regard, the dragon will have ancestors; when the dragon has ancestors, the tomb will not stand alone and exposed—sometimes like a moored boat with oars stowed, sometimes like an enthroned lord with civil and martial officials in full attendance. As for the theories of Three Failures and Three Taboos, they are simply the opposite of this and may be deduced by analogy. Fire aids the guest of literary brilliance, hence fire alone is cited to illustrate the rest.

From this chapter through the thirtieth, all are the discourses of Xiong of Guangfeng. Others observe form, I observe stars; others observe structure, I observe *qing*. Star-peaks are but the dragon’s exterior, while *qing*-veins are the dragon’s essence. The Metal star favors which *gui* for its lodging? Earth and Wood intermingle in their *qing*. When blue and white approach without water or fire, unmelting and untransforming, they become crude and unrefined. Metal, Wood, Water, and Earth are the tomb’s stars; hollows, pincers, breasts, and protrusions are the tomb’s forms; convex, concave, high, and low are the tomb’s terrain. Examine the evidence closely and discuss it clearly: first observe the Bright Hall and the facing case, then the rear lodging and the *gui* support, and beside them the dragon, tiger, and gazing water. Beyond this, consider the *qing* of sands and water.

I have seen folding-screen and writing-brush sands, the White Tiger clinging close in a picture-perfect form. Yet because the gorge’s right side stands alone, the youngest chamber remains without esteem. I have seen jade-belt and sleeping-bow waters, curving and embracing the Azure Dragon’s maw. Yet because the gorge’s left side lacks an auspicious star, the eldest chamber meets no felicity. I have seen hat-like and zither-like cases, solemn and towering trees truly admirable. Why then do the descendants fail to achieve scholarly honors? It is because the *gui*’s lodging has disordered the stars. I have seen a Bright Hall teeming like ten thousand horses, with ranks assembled and voices raised in acclaim. Who would know that the lip-cushion is not resonant? Wealth has no accumulation, and officials receive no stipends. I have seen a water’s mouth like a gourd, *zhi* and *xuan* winding and turning to regard one another. How then does the household not prosper? It is only because the dragon and tomb lack granaries. I have seen a literary brush thrust upon the case, with "Summons to Court" and "Heavenly Steed" present. If the dragon and tomb lack proper arrangement, why endure a decade of cold windows? I have seen a brocade quilt covering a tooth-bed, layered mountains resembling the forms of descendants. Yet because the dragon and tomb fall into gloom and chill, the household’s sons and daughters-in-law remain lonely and struggle to thrive.

How do sands and waters become calamities? It is only because the dragon and tomb’s original spirit is defeated. It is like a weak lord and mediocre ruler—treacherous ministers and fierce generals wield great power. How do sands and waters possess strong fortune? It is only because the dragon and tomb’s original spirit flourishes. It is like a sagely lord enthroned in the court—all four directions are shielded by stalwart generals. I have heard that dragon and tomb must greet one another, that water and sands must accord with one another. Auspicious water can always dispel malevolent sands, and good sands can also regulate water’s afflictions. If a yin sand on the right crosses to the left, water departing on the left cannot become a calamity. Yet if the sand departs and the water also departs, the household’s feast will swiftly collapse.

The dragon and tomb must recognize their *yongshen*; disturbing the *yongshen* is no trivial matter. Be warned: it may be known but not spoken, lest the contemporary masters fail to recognize it truly. What *shen* does a Metal dragon and Metal tomb employ? It is born in *si* and reposes in *chou*. Either use these two directions as facing mountains or employ them as entry points. Do not fear the Yellow Springs or the Punishing Tomb; the tomb must align with the dragon’s approach. The Doomed Fate favors the palaces of Water and Fire, and the burial time must be at the *chou* hour’s throat. Within the *si-chou* palace, *you* is concealed; one must use *mao* to strike and awaken the *hun*. If descendants include *hai* or *wei* persons, combining to activate the striking star is truly infallible.

The Metal Horse originally dwells in *hai* and *you*; the Metal Fortune cycles to *shen* and *you*. When the Fortune is struck, officials arrive; when the Horse is struck, illness is hard to prevent. If the Horse resides in the Illness Palace, favor its generation and combination; if the Fortune dwells in the Office Position, it must be lofty and grand. The roots of wealth and nobility lie in the Womb, yet maintenance favors the Long Life position. Arrangements must reside in the Flourishing direction, while verification favors the Repose and Extinction positions. I urge you: strike the Life, not the Womb—striking the Womb may damage the root’s origin. Only by striking from the Life position can maintenance be flexible and the celestial mechanism swift. I urge you: strike the Tomb, not the Flourishing—striking the Flourishing may render arrangements vain. Only by striking from the Tomb position can verification be natural and unobstructed.

Metal’s nobility lies within *yin* and *wu*; the Noble Person may be combined but not struck. Combining to activate the Noble Person and striking the Fortune—why fear wealth and nobility will not follow? Pray, how does one combine the Noble Person? For Metal’s nobility in *yin* and *wu*, use *xu* to combine.

The *yin* and *wu* directions hold auspicious stars; those born in the *xu* year find this most wondrous. If the deceased’s fate aligns with *mao* or *you*, wealth and nobility will converge in abundance.

Water and Fire prize their Tomb and Extinction positions; Metal’s nobility lies in □□, Water’s in Earth’s waxing and waning, and Earth’s in the *wei* Tomb and Extinction.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: On Transformed Burial Sites**
Of the nineteen noble tombs, all are transformed types—how could common masters with vulgar eyes ever recognize them?

1. The first transformation: Fire scorches Metal, its molten essence flowing in a single thread. Only upon encountering Earth does the burial settle, its breast like a hanging gallbladder, true Metal revealed.
2. The second transformation: Wood chases Earth, Earth’s boulders transmuting into Metal’s offspring. Seek the nest where Fire lingers, and you will find a headrest and table before you.
3. The third transformation: Metal carves Wood, Wood morphing into a phoenix’s form or a chicken’s comb. At the sight of Water’s star, insertion is fitting—its subtle protrusion like a bud marks true Wood.
4. The fourth transformation: Earth dams Water, its torrents surging like a sloughing serpent. A Metal peak looms ahead, and the tomb rests serenely, as if suspended in a hollow.
5. The fifth transformation: Water extinguishes Fire. Fire’s star snuffed out like a water chestnut, seek the branching Wood’s nodes, where Water’s star hangs over the tomb’s hour.

Transformations through conquest favor the sight of the Father—see the Father, and the burial brings nobility and wealth. Transformations through generation favor the sight of Wealth—see Wealth, and riches and honor descend from heaven.

The subtleties of this wondrous art cannot be fully expounded; conquest and generation, generation and conquest—both must be arranged. Generative transformations delight in Wealth and Office; conquest delights in Father and Son. Thus, both are harmonized.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: On the Essentials of Dragon-Seeking**
Do not say seeking the Dragon is hard—it is harder than gazing at high mountains from flat ground. Do not say it is easy—it is easier when viewing flat ground from high mountains.

1. Observe how the Dragon rises: where the true Dragon ascends, spirits gather.
2. Observe how the Dragon spreads: where the true Dragon expands, support abounds.
3. Observe how the Dragon crouches: where the true Dragon lies low, clusters form.
4. Observe how the Dragon moves: where the true Dragon travels, sentiment flows.
5. Observe the direction of its momentum: the direction it faces often conceals its path.

Where is this concealment made clear? Behind, there are senders; ahead, there are greeters. Yet the senders and greeters lie in the margins—guard the Guardian Dragon, but do not mistake it for the true Dragon. The true Dragon flashes and emerges; here, you must trace its roots. Examine carefully the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—and identify the stars to name the Lesser Ancestor. If the Lesser Ancestor and the Remote Ancestor mutually generate, you will know this place’s power is layered. When the time is right, Father and Son, Wealth and Office follow—thus you know the lineage bears a thousand years of fortune.

When the Dragon moves with *qi* bound, you will know a true hall lies concealed. Having observed the Lesser Ancestor, next observe the pursuit: where Wealth and Office pursue, it is truly rare. If the Parents pursue, let them come leisurely; if the Children pursue, let them arrive in fullness. If they are neither leisurely nor full, prosperity will be fleeting. If you seek great wealth and nobility, Master Yang treasures only the pursuit of Wealth and Office. If it is merely I pursuing I, even sudden fortune brings no misfortune.

Having observed the Dragon, next observe where the Ghost descends—the Ghost’s descent reveals the stars’ spread. If the Ghost descends to generate the Dragon or the tomb, hidden blessings are truly worth celebrating. But if the Dragon or tomb generates the Ghost’s descent, it instead breeds thieving *qi*—a curse. Neither I conquering nor being conquered by it is fitting; better to harmonize and bear the load together.

In the plains, the Ghost’s descent should be pillowable; on high mountains, it should be reliable. Regardless of left, right, or center, observe where its sentiment embraces. Having observed the Ghost’s descent, next observe the tomb—distinguish between high and low, convex and concave. Observe where the *qi* enters: remember, burial must ride the generative *qi*. *Qi* entering through the ears is first; through the crown, second; through the waist, third. Beneath the transforming brain, recognize the eaves; the tomb’s sentiment should resemble a sprouting shoot. Above, a dimple; within, a trace; below, a plump lip—do not let it waste away. Shrimp whiskers and cicada wings press on both sides; chicken hearts and fish bubbles rise in mutual reflection.

Dragons of Earth and Wood bear many breasts and protrusions; Dragons of Metal and Water, bells and nests. Having observed the tomb, next observe its embrace. The embrace must harmonize with the Dragon’s spirit. If it embraces me with Wealth on both sides, descendants will wear golden belts at their waists. If it embraces me with Office on both sides, gold and jade will pile high, bringing a thousand blessings. If Parents embrace, descendants will be rare; if Children embrace, Parents will decline. Better that I embrace only myself—then living in ease brings no hardship.

Having observed the embrace, next observe the audience. What I generate and what generates me both align. If Wealth and Office also gather, the household’s wealth and nobility will know no end. Having observed the audience and the table, next observe the gates and doors—do not let descendants occupy them. First, Parents; second, Wealth; third, also welcome the Office star.

The auspicious person’s form is shaped by human hands—only arrange the head to face inward. Having examined Vermilion, Mysterious, Azure, and White, the sand and water, the Bright Hall, will naturally be fine. Water’s coming and going need not be constrained—seek clarity only in the directions. Its arrival should be leisurely, not hasty; its departure should be reluctant, as if loath to leave. If you seek great wealth and nobility, *xun*-water should flow ceaselessly to the mouth.

Land on high mountains is easy to manipulate; land on flat ground is often treacherous. When high mountains descend into the plains, always look for fur and bone. How to recognize fur? Where no crops grow, only grasses and reeds. How to recognize bone? Where earth and stone lie buried yet ever jut forth. Where there is fur and bone, there is protection; where there is protection, stars and spirits assist.

Where there is no *fengshui*, there is *fengshui*; where there is *fengshui*, there is no *fengshui*. Where there is no *fengshui*, eight or nine out of ten may be buried. Where there is *fengshui*, after searching the world, you will find scarcely one. This is the golden palm of Dragon-seeking—only those with keen eyes and clever minds can expound it.

**Chapter Thirty: On the Essentials of Residential and Burial Sites**

How can a family attain wealth and nobility? It must possess both a *yang* dwelling and a *yin* burial ground.
The *yang* is like a boat, the *yin* like its oar—when assessing the *yang*, first determine its orientation.
*Tai* and *Yang* aligned bring the root of wealth and nobility; *Sheng* and *Yu* open and expansive bring wealth and nobility to fruition.
*Guan* and *Dai* level and smooth bring pure wealth and nobility; *Guanwang* lofty and grand bring righteous wealth and nobility.
*Shuai* and *Bing* shielded bring secure wealth and nobility; *Si* open and receptive bring effortless wealth and nobility.
Burial sites that gather and store bring enduring wealth and nobility—auspicious spirits must align with their directions.
Yet one must also examine the connections between them, for the art of connection abounds with prohibitions.
*Tai*, *Yang*, and *Changsheng* must be separated—without separation, clarity is lost.
*Yu* and *Guan* despise hollows and protrusions—where hollows and protrusions exist, discord arises.
*Linguan* and *Diwang* should interlock—without interlocking, no scholarly or official success.
Between *Shuai* and *Wang*, avoid unevenness—one high, one low invites constant alarm.
*Si* and *Bing* require protection—without protection, jealousy and resentment arise.

The principles for *yin* and *yang* sites are the same: tombs and houses must achieve harmony with the stars.
If the *yin* site generates or restrains *yang*, descendants will enjoy wealth and nobility with grandeur.
If the *yin* site generates or restrains *yin*, descendants will attain wealth and nobility yet remain subdued.
But if *yin* and *yang* share the same *qi*, descendants’ wealth and nobility will endure without decline.

For *yang* dwellings, wealth and nobility require a root source, as well as maintenance and arrangement.
Every aspect must yield verification—only when the Five Auspices are complete does Heaven and Earth bestow favor.
Yet within these orientations, distinctions arise: *Sheng*, *Yang*, *Mu*, and *Wang* govern the four directions.
Even with a root source, without proper arrangement, fame will never reach the Phoenix Pool.
If Tiger Sand interlocks like a sash, official rank is revoked—no ten thousand strings of cash shall return.
With arrangement but no root source, why strive in vain for an official career?
If the Dragon’s head arches like a scholar’s cap, one may seek office through tribute or purchase.
With both root source and arrangement, one passes the imperial exams and returns in brocade robes.
If still not girded with a golden belt, know the burial site lacks support.
When support and arrangement are both present, and the root source aligns with its position, many will top the imperial exams.
Yet if one does not ascend to the Three Dukes, know the verification lacks convergence.

The *Hai* direction’s auspices favor descendants; the *Li* palace’s blessings fall upon those born in *Wu*.
Ascend the mountain and ponder these details—within your breast, the stars and immortals shall instruct.

*Confucian Principles and Harmonized Geomancy: A Record of Filial Piety, Scroll One, Concluded*

*Confucian Principles and Harmonized Geomancy: A Record of Filial Piety, Scroll Two*
**Chapter Thirty-One: On Selecting Auspicious Dates**

Those who practice geomancy concern themselves with but two matters: assessing terrain and selecting auspicious dates. Yet among the schools of this art, once they ascend the mountain, they abandon all discussion of terrain, seducing others instead with doctrines of celestial seals, astral configurations, and *qi* principles. The preceding scroll has already addressed this in full, and thus will not belabor the point, taking instead the proper alignment of form and *qi* as its guiding principle.

As for the selection of dates—here, the delusive theories that mislead are even more egregious. There are the so-called "various schools," the "thunder" methods, the "strange gates," each proliferating in wild and baseless profusion. All trace their origins to Lü Cai, whose *Comprehensive Almanac* disordered yin and yang, inverted the Five Phases, and so led practitioners to perpetuate errors, compounding distortions until the characters for *hai* and *shu* were confounded, their misreadings passed down without end.

During the Zhengde and Jiajing reigns, such bizarre doctrines spread even more widely. To this day, spurious texts defile the ox-boring pillars, deceiving not only petty men into leading others astray, but even gentlemen who, believing them, bring regret upon themselves. Blessings may not be secured, yet harm surely follows—what then becomes of the fulfillment of filial piety? Even when coincidental alignments occur, they arise from the hidden accumulations of virtuous households, not the power of delusive arts.

Master Yang once declared: *"Only when one comprehends the Five Phases in their inverted state does one become a Great Luo Immortal."* This holds true for Master Yang alone. Those who are not of his stature yet impose rigid interpretations upon these principles will invert mutual generation into mutual conquest, and mutual conquest into mutual generation, turning harmony into discord, utterly violating the fundamental principles of creation. How dare men employ such methods lightly?

Thus it is known: the hundred schools of miscellaneous doctrines are all illusions and falsehoods.

The profound principles of *Qimen*—who has truly grasped their subtle workings? Only the Seven Governors, transmitted since the time of Rong Cheng’s investiture, when Yao reverently observed the vast heavens to bestow the seasons upon humanity, and Shun aligned the Seven Governors with the jade pivot of the *xuanji*, have been the unvarying foundation by which successive dynasties regulated the calendar and illuminated the times. This principle, though subtle in its obscurity and manifest in its clarity, is none other than the true pattern of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation. How then can men perversely abandon it in favor of strange and aberrant practices?

Little do they realize that the Five Movements and Six Qi are but the cyclical permutations of yin-yang and the Five Phases, while the Five Planets and Seven Luminaries are their radiant manifestations. The cyclical permutations flow ceaselessly through Heaven and Earth, bringing fortune or misfortune; the radiant manifestations shine perpetually within the cosmos, bestowing auspiciousness or inauspiciousness. Thus, in selection, one must first examine the qi movements to assess the dragon spirits, weighing their mutual generation, conquest, restraint, and transformation; then, by the positions of the stars, determine the orientation, discerning their stations of delay, concealment, or retrogression. These two considerations are the essentials of selection, grounded in the verifiable records of stellar and calendrical astronomy. Yet the flow of qi movements varies from dawn to dusk, and the distribution of stellar positions shifts from morning to evening. Only by consulting the Seven Governors’ almanac and mastering the methods of celestial reckoning can one attain the true secret of fate-creation and avoid regret. Other systems—such as the *Wenli*, *Wannianli*, or *Yizhangjing*—are unreliable. A deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles; how can one not be cautious?

As for the mountain schools’ spirit-killings, one need only avoid the Three Killings and the Grand Year when they are in ascendance; when they are not, they pose no threat, and other killings may likewise be disregarded. Detailed explanations follow below.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: On Heavenly Timing**

The *Book of Changes* states: *"Supreme indeed is the generative power of Kun! All things owe their birth to it, as it follows the mandate of Heaven."* From this, we know that the vital qi within the Earth rides the celestial rhythms in due season. Thus, in spring and summer, the heavenly timing stirs the mechanism of emergence for the myriad things, and the Earth’s qi follows, unfolding its functions of growth and nurturance. In autumn and winter, the heavenly timing stirs the mechanism of withdrawal, and the Earth’s qi follows, gathering and storing. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"The Way of Earth achieves no completion, yet it ensures the fulfillment of all things."* This is the principle at work.

The dragon, cave, sand, and water are the movements of vital qi upon the Earth; the year, month, day, and hour are the revolutions of vital qi in Heaven. To secure the Earth’s favor without the Heaven’s is like desiring harvest in spring and summer or growth in autumn and winter—an impossibility. How can those who scrutinize the Earth below fail to gaze upon the Heavens above, thereby harmonizing yin and yang and aligning with the true pattern of their conjoined movements?

Yet one must not preconceive rigid configurations or predetermine transformations; rather, one should assess the flourishing or decline of the mountains, rivers, and qi movements in the moment, applying the methods of supplementation, assistance, conquest, or dispersion as needed. How could such dynamism be confined by the dead schematics of almanacs?

Someone may ask: Mencius said, *"Heavenly timing is not as valuable as terrestrial advantage, and terrestrial advantage is not as valuable as human harmony."* Thus, the insufficiency of heavenly timing is evident. Moreover, in ancient times, the Son of Heaven was buried after seven months, feudal lords after five, great officers after three, and scholars after a month. If one were bound by specific times and days, such customs could not be observed. Hence, some practitioners claim that once a site is secured, burial may proceed without regard to timing. Alas, this is mistaken.

Mencius spoke thus because the feudal lords of his time lacked human harmony, so he weighed their relative importance to enlighten them—not to advocate the complete abandonment of heavenly timing and terrestrial advantage. Otherwise, why would the sage kings have regulated the calendar and illuminated the seasons, or dug and constructed ponds?

In ancient times, the Son of Heaven was buried after seven months to await the arrival of feudal lords; feudal lords after five months to await their allies; great officers after three months to await their court peers; and scholars after a month to await their kinsfolk. Though these were royal decrees, the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of burial was never neglected. Yet if one rigidly adheres to almanacs for selection, what is auspicious for one may be inauspicious for another, and what benefits the deceased may harm the living, leaving no burial opportunity for decades.

By using the Seven Governors for selection, one need only avoid the Three Killings and the Grand Year when they are in ascendance, allowing burials in every month of every year without conflict between heavenly timing and royal decree. Those practitioners who claim that once a site is secured, burial may proceed without regard to timing—are they not driven by a lack of principle, or perhaps an eagerness for profit? The wise must not fail to discern this.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: On Fate-Creation**

In the art of fate-creation, the day stem serves as the master, the month as the guiding thread, the year as the foundation, and the hour as the outcome. Once the Eight Characters are arranged, one examines which configuration they form, then applies the method accordingly. If the configuration is inauspicious, one should select another. This differs from astrology, for astrologers discuss fate as ordained by Heaven, immutable in its principle. In selection, however, fate is crafted by human agency, allowing one to choose the most favorable course.

I lament that those who practice fate-creation today overemphasize orientation, or the fate of the deceased, or the examination of the master, or insist on creating a new master—all of which are misguided. For the living, the moment of birth marks the origin of fate; if this origin is pure and unadulterated, lifelong prosperity is assured. For the dead, the moment of interment marks the origin of fate; if this origin is in ascendance, the ancestral lineage will endure. This principle cannot be gainsaid.

Yet if orientation is fixed at the dawn of creation, and life’s fate is determined at birth, then the fate of the deceased is already set, and the day of death lies ahead—all one can do is avoid direct clashes. To prioritize these factors in fate-creation is misguided. Therefore, the adept in fate-creation must select an auspicious Eight-Character configuration, scrutinize the qi, and reckon the stars, fulfilling both requirements to complete the entire scheme.

For the waxing and waning of qi form the foundation of fortune and misfortune. This principle underscores the paramount importance of stellar configurations, for they govern the manifestation or concealment of fortune’s handle—this, too, must not be taken lightly. Thus, when Wood is dominant, Wood must serve as the primary element; when Fire prevails, Fire must lead; when Earth holds sway, Earth must govern; when Metal is ascendant, Metal must preside; and when Water flows strong, Water must take precedence. The Four Pillars must harmonize to achieve balance, auspicious stars should occupy solid positions in their proper seasons, while inauspicious stars ought to fall into decline or void. Only then may the configuration be deemed viable. Should the Dragon Qi be amiss—either excessive or deficient—and the stellar alignments further deviate from harmony, even a configuration promising supreme wealth and nobility would be of no avail.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: On Configurations**
The method of fate-creation begins with determining the configuration, which may take the following forms: the Sun-Moon Opposition, the Sun-Moon Conjunction, the Trine Illumination, the Cardinal Quadrant Illumination, the Stem-Branch Enclosure, the Close Enclosure, the Imperial Star Enclosure, the Imperial Star Alignment, or the Triple Auspicious Illumination. Though configurations vary, the Sun and Moon must serve as the foundation—only then can it be considered a superior configuration.

The Sun-Moon Opposition typically occurs at the full moon; the Sun-Moon Conjunction, at the new moon; the Trine Illumination, around the tenth and twentieth days; the Cardinal Quadrant Illumination, also at the full moon; the Stem-Branch Enclosure, around the fifth, sixth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth days; and the Close Enclosure, around the second, third, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth days. If the given day aligns with a configuration, every mountain may be utilized, though the timing will differ. For instance, at the fourth quarter of the *mao* hour, it may serve as the *zi* mountain; for a *wu* alignment, the lower fourth quarter may serve as the *gui* mountain. A *ding* alignment at the upper fourth quarter of the *chen* hour may serve as the *chou* mountain; a *wei* alignment at the lower first quarter of the *chen* hour may serve as the *gen* mountain. For a *kun* alignment, follow the sequence in due order—this principle applies to all twenty-four mountains. Only the mountains where the Three Killings ride in strength or where the Grand Year resides must be avoided. For configurations where the Imperial Star aligns with the Sun, only the *xu* hour is viable; all others are incompatible. Beware of solar eclipses on the new moon and lunar eclipses on the full moon—though before the eclipse or after its conclusion, no deep taboo applies.

Additional configurations—such as the Dual Virtues Illumination, the Official and Fortune Illumination, the Fields and Wealth Illumination, the Literary Eminence and Literary Star Illumination, and the Examination Success Illumination—are all noble, yet none surpass those where the Sun serves as the primary element. Nevertheless, these are but the carpenter’s square and the archer’s target—rules and standards for artisans. To wield the square to draw the circle, to grasp the bow to hit the mark, lies in the hands of the practitioner. Detailed diagrams follow.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: On Life and Destiny**
In the art of selection, fate-creation holds the greatest weight; and in fate-creation, the establishment of life and destiny is paramount. The Sun is as a father: one receives qi from the father, and thus life is born. Therefore, in establishing life, one must examine the degree where the Sun resides as the life degree. The Moon is as a mother: one takes form within the mother, and thus the body is born. Therefore, in establishing the body, one must examine the palace where the Moon resides as the body palace.

Modern astrologers who fix life at the *mao* hour by adding the Sun’s number to the birth time err. Those who take the Moon’s position on the given day as the body palace also err. For the Sun naturally moves leftward, traversing one palace per hour. Thus, around the winter solstice, when the Sun rises at the *chen* hour, one begins counting from *chen* and proceeds sequentially to the birth hour to determine the life palace. Around the summer solstice, when the Sun rises at the *yin* hour, one begins from *yin* and counts to the birth hour. At other times, when the Sun rises at the *mao* hour, one begins from *mao* and counts to the birth hour—this is the fixed method for establishing life.

The Moon also moves leftward, traversing slightly less than one palace per hour. Thus, one must first determine the hour and degree of the Moon’s position, then count sequentially from that degree, beginning with the birth hour, to locate the body palace. The same principle applies to other cases—this is the fixed method for establishing the body.

However, the Moon’s position varies between dawn and dusk, and even within these periods, gradual shifts occur. From the autumn equinox to the following spring equinox, the dawn position is said to be in *mao*, yet in truth, only the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth days lie in *mao*; the nineteenth and twentieth in *chen*; the twenty-first, twenty-second, and twenty-third in *si*; the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth in *wu*; the twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-eighth in *wei*; and the twenty-ninth and thirtieth in *shen*. From the White Dew to the following Pure Brightness, the dusk position is said to be in *you*, yet in truth, only the first, second, and third days lie in *you*; the fourth and fifth in *xu*; the sixth, seventh, and eighth in *hai*; the ninth and tenth in *zi*; the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth in *chou*; and the fourteenth and fifteenth in *yin*. From the Grain Rain to the autumn equinox, the dusk position is said to be in *xu*—one must count sequentially from *xu*. From the Pure Brightness to the White Dew, the dusk position is said to be in *yin*—one must count from *yin*.

The Sun completes one revolution per day—how could it remain in *mao* at all hours? The Moon also completes one revolution per day, though it falls short by twelve degrees. How could it remain in the same palace at all times? This principle is self-evident, yet the wise fail to examine it.

This is why stellar calculations often fail to prove accurate, and those who craft destinies all lose the truth!

**Chapter Thirty-Six: On Discerning Qi**

In the methods of fengshui masters for discerning *qi*, one must first observe the grand trend of the dragon—from whence it comes and where the vein at its head halts. For instance, if the grand dragon comes from the south and, upon reaching its head, turns to face west, one should then supplement the vein at its head to form the grand wealth configuration. If one instead supplements the grand dragon’s body, the head will suffer restraint, and misfortune will swiftly follow. The rest follow this principle.

Or if the grand dragon comes from the east and, at its head, faces north, one should supplement the vein at its head to serve as the grand *shengqi* (generative *qi*). If one supplements the grand dragon’s body, it will drain the *qi* at the head, and the calamity of cold decline will soon follow. If the drainage is excessive, it will surely harm the inhabitants. The rest follow this principle.

Or if the grand dragon comes from the north and, at its head, faces east, one should only supplement the grand dragon’s body to serve as the *shengqi* at the head. If one supplements the vein at the head, it will drain the grand dragon’s *qi*. Though no immediate harm may appear, the seeds of decline and decay are sown therein. The rest follow this principle.

Nowadays, practitioners focus solely on the final segment at the head, treating its *qi* embryo as primary—this deceives people only for a time, but what of the later calamities?

In observing the grand trend, one must take the originating vein of the dragon as the foundation, disregarding its intermediate twists and turns. In examining the head, one must take the segment behind the site as the foundation, though what follows need not be rigidly observed.

Yet the Five *Qi* alternate in residence, having no fixed abode. If a dragon of balanced harmony dwells therein, the blessings it bestows will be great—even if the sitting mountain’s restraint or drainage poses no obstacle. But if a dragon of excess or deficiency dwells therein, the misfortune it brings will also be great, and even if the sitting mountain is prosperous, what benefit is there?

Thus, the ancients spoke of "occupying the substantial while riding the void," prioritizing the dragon’s spirit over rigid adherence to the sitting mountain’s yin-yang and Five Phases. One need only ensure that auspicious stars arrive at the sitting position, or at the facing direction, or at the three harmonies, or at the four cardinals, or at the palaces of mutual embrace—all are auspicious.

As for inauspicious stars, one need only avoid their periods of dominance. When such stars are weak or in decline, they pose no threat; discretion lies with the practitioner.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: On Calculating Stars**

In the method of calculating stars, one must rely primarily on the *Seven Governors’ Almanac*, applying it to whichever direction the mountain occupies. The Sun, Moon, Emperor Star, and Grace Star are all supremely auspicious deities. The Commanding Star, Utilized Star, Fortune Star, and Auspicious Constellations are also propitious. The Yearly Virtue, Heavenly Virtue, Monthly Virtue, Monthly Union, Noble Persons, Grandchildren and Horses, Fields and Wealth Palaces, Literary Brilliance, Scholarly Honors, and Imperial Examination Stars—all are auxiliary auspicious deities. Whether they arrive at the mountain, the facing direction, the three harmonies, the four cardinals, a timely and useful palace, or a palace of mutual embrace, all are auspicious omens.

As for the Adversary Star, Calamity Star, Three Killings, Great Killing, and Grand Year Deities—all must be avoided. If they dominate and occupy favorable positions, their harm will be great; if they are weak, in decline, or void, they need not be feared.

For the essential method of selection is this: pursue the auspicious and avoid the inauspicious. Moreover, the heavens display omens of fortune and misfortune precisely through the Seven Governors. How can one neglect the method of calculating stars?

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: On the Two and Five**

I have heard that the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to yin and yang, yin and yang give rise to the Five Phases, and through the transformations of the Five Phases, the generation and completion of the myriad things are perfected. This is the unchanging principle of creation, constant across a hundred thousand ages.

In heaven, it manifests in the sun, moon, and stars, with the Five Phases arrayed in order. On earth, it appears in mountains, rivers, and living things, with the Five *Qi* flowing and circulating. In humans, it is expressed as vigor and compliance forming virtue, from which the Five Natures and Five Relationships emerge.

At the dawn of creation, this principle was revealed in the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, awakening the divine wisdom of the sages. Their purpose was to elucidate the essence of yin-yang and the Five Phases, guiding the people toward the path of seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune.

Observe the *Chart*: the number fifty resides at the center, while the *Writing* places five at the center—both represent the Supreme Ultimate. The *Chart* and *Writing* each contain twenty odd numbers and twenty even numbers—these are the numbers of yin and yang. In the *Chart*, one and six reside in the north, belonging to Water; two and seven in the south, belonging to Fire; three and eight in the east, belonging to Wood; four and nine in the west, belonging to Metal; five and ten in the center, belonging to Earth, with their prosperity delegated to the four corners.

Examining the *Luo Writing* after its transposition, the numbers of generation and restraint likewise interweave with the *River Chart*. Thus, from the Three Sovereigns to the hundred kings, all who regulated calendars and illuminated the seasons relied upon these principles.

Today, calendar makers depend on them to calculate celestial movements; physicians rely on them to investigate the *qi* and pulse; astrologers use them to predict human longevity, prosperity, and adversity. Moreover, fengshui serves to align earthly patterns with heavenly timing, forming the foundation of blessings for the people. How could one defy the correct principles of creation and follow absurd doctrines?

Alas, Lü Cai’s *Hongfan* Five Phases deviated from the true principle, and his theories of disputing yin and prioritizing yang were especially perverse. He failed to recognize that the Two and Five are rooted in the original state. Yet once one man set the precedent, later practitioners followed in his footsteps, ensnaring fleeting profit while sowing lasting harm. The people suffer the consequences, unaware, while the practitioners reap the gains without remorse—is this not deeply lamentable?

Our Taizu, the August High Emperor, soared like a dragon over the Huai region, reopening the cosmos in its renewal and awakening the benighted from their wandering paths. Fearing that the dozens of almanacs and divination manuals were all harming the people, in the ninth year of the Hongwu reign, he further prohibited their fraudulent fabrication, destroyed all counterfeit books, and commanded supervising officials to correct and select the calendar for promulgation throughout the realm, establishing a model for posterity—all to clarify the true transmission of yin and yang and reveal the profound mirror for seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune. Thus, a summary is set forth here.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: On Mountain Orientations and the Two and Five**
Observing the odd and even numbers of the *Hetu*, one discerns the origin of yin-yang and the Five Phases. Their mutual generation and completion each attain the marvel of spontaneity, all being the essence of heaven and earth’s transformative nurturance, disclosed to humanity. For instance:
- Heaven’s One generates Water, Earth’s Six completes it, residing in the north at the *hai* and *zi* positions. Thus, from *hai* Palace’s *kui* 1° to *zi* Palace’s *wei* 7°, all pertain to yin Water. From *zi* Palace’s *wei* 6° to *chou*’s *dou* 22°, all pertain to yang Water.
- Earth’s Two generates Fire, Heaven’s Seven completes it, residing in the south at the *si* and *wu* positions. Thus, from *si* Palace’s *han* 9° to *wu*’s *zhang* 9°, all pertain to yin Fire. From *wu*’s *zhang* 8° to *wei*’s *jing* 27°, all pertain to yang Fire.
- Heaven’s Three generates Wood, Earth’s Eight completes it, residing in the east at the *yin* and *mao* positions. Thus, from *yin* Palace’s *dou* 3° to *mao*’s *xin* 3°, all pertain to yang Wood. From *mao*’s *xin* 2° to *chen*’s *jiao* 11°, all pertain to yin Wood.
- Earth’s Four generates Metal, Heaven’s Nine completes it, residing in the west at the *shen* and *you* positions. Thus, from *shen* Palace’s *jing* 8° to *you*’s *bi* 1°, all pertain to yang Metal. From *you*’s *bi* 0° to *xu*’s *lou* 4°, all pertain to yin Metal.
- Heaven’s Five generates Earth, Earth’s Ten completes it, though residing in the central palace, its *qi* flourishes in the four corners. Thus, the 18° of *chen* and *wei*, along with the final 18° of *xu*, all pertain to yang Earth. The final 18° of *chou* and *wei* all pertain to yin Earth.

The celestial circle comprises 365¼°, with each of the Five Phases allotted slightly over 72°, all being natural numbers, fixed and immutable. The twelve celestial palaces are demarcated between the earthly branches, yet though they occupy their positions, their affiliations remain unchanged. For example:
- *Qian* lies between *xu* and *hai*: the right 7½° in *xu* are reckoned as yang Earth, while the left 7½° in *hai* are reckoned as yin Water.
- *Ren* lies between *hai* and *zi*: the right 7½° in *hai* are reckoned as yin Water, while the left 7½° in *zi* are reckoned as yang Water. The rest follow this pattern.

Moreover, earlier scholars held that the Eight Trigrams merely elucidate the circulation of heavenly *qi* and never altered the yin-yang or Five Phases affiliations of the earthly branches. The ancient luopan compass featured only the twelve earthly branches, conforming to the fixed numbers of the *Hetu*. Later generations added the eighty-two celestial stems merely to complete the twenty-four positions, corresponding to the twenty-four solar terms of the year. To alter the yin-yang or Five Phases of the earthly branches based on the celestial stems is incorrect. The Eight Trigrams merely verify the movement of heavenly *qi*; to use them to alter the yin-yang or Five Phases of the earthly branches is likewise incorrect.

In later ages, failing to grasp this mechanism, some devised the fallacious "celestial star trigram examples," greatly deluding the world. Scholars, too, failed to examine these critically and instead followed them blindly, even contriving forced interpretations and conflating them with the sagely teachings to obscure the truth. They did not realize that the principles of yin-yang and the Five Phases are the wondrous mechanism of heaven and earth’s creation, not something human intellect or effort can augment or diminish.

**Chapter Forty: On the Seven Governors**
When the sun and moon conjoin, it is called *shuo* (new moon); when they oppose, it is called *wang* (full moon); when the moon’s light is evenly divided, it is called *xian* (quarter moon); when the moon’s light is entirely extinguished, it is called *hui* (dark moon). The five planets hide when they meet the sun, halt when in triple conjunction, move swiftly when near the sun, and slowly when far from it. When their slowness peaks, they halt; after halting long, they retreat; after retreating long, they proceed in direct motion.

The sun fears *Rahu*, the moon fears *Ketu*; Wood fears Metal in its flourishing, Fire fears Water in its flourishing, Earth fears Wood in its flourishing, Metal fears Fire in its flourishing, Water fears Earth in its flourishing. The sun favors daylight, the moon favors night; flourishing Wood favors Metal, flourishing Fire favors Water, flourishing Earth favors Wood, flourishing Metal favors Fire, flourishing Water favors Earth. Weak Water cherishes Metal, weak Metal cherishes Earth, weak Earth cherishes Fire, weak Fire cherishes Wood, weak Wood cherishes Water. Declining Water does not generate Wood, declining Wood does not generate Fire, declining Fire does not generate Earth, declining Earth does not generate Metal, declining Metal does not generate Water. In spring, Earth does not overcome Water; in summer, Metal does not overcome Wood; in the late seasons, Water does not overcome Fire; in autumn, Wood does not overcome Earth; in winter, Fire does not overcome Metal. These are all essential methods of the Seven Governors; scholars cannot be ignorant of them.

**Chapter Forty-One: On Crossing Palaces**
The constellations arrayed in the heavens number twenty-eight lodges, totaling 365¼°, though they rise and set, they do not truly shift. The heavens revolve leftward, completing one circuit daily and advancing one degree. The sun, moon, five planets, *qi*, and comets all proceed in direct motion. Only *Ketu* and *Rahu* revolve rightward—this is the Confucians’ unchanging doctrine, even the *Gexiang Xinshu* expounds it in detail. However, calendar makers, finding it inconvenient for computation, claim: "The heavens revolve leftward, while the sun, moon, and five planets all revolve rightward." The sequence of the twenty palaces’ degrees is counted from left to right for swift calculation—this is the method of calendar-making.

To select an auspicious date, one must adhere to the former doctrine to ensure precise timing. In all cases, the seven luminaries proceed in direct motion from right to left, with only *Rahu* and *Ketu* moving in reverse. For example:

- When *Rahu* is at 2° in *Nü* (女), it moves to 1° past *Chou* (丑);
- When *Dipper* (斗) is at 4° in *Chou*, it moves to 3° past *Yin* (寅);
- When *Tail* (尾) is at 2° in *Yin*, it moves to 1° past *Mao* (卯);
- When *Root* (氐) is at 2° in *Mao*, it moves to 1° past *Chen* (辰);
- When *Winnowing Basket* (輸) is at 10° in *Chen*, it moves to 9° past *Si* (巳);
- When *Spread* (張) is at 15° in *Si*, it moves to 14° past *Wu* (午);
- When *Willow* (柳) is at 4° in *Wu*, it moves to 3° past *Wei* (未);
- When *Well* (井) is at 9° in *Wei*, it moves to 8° past *Shen* (申);
- When *Net* (畢) is at 7° in *Shen*, it moves to 6° past *You* (酉);
- When *Stomach* (胃) is at 4° in *You*, it moves to 3° past *Xu* (戌);
- When *Straddler* (婁) is at 2° in *Xu*, it moves to 1° past *Hai* (亥);
- When *Rooftop* (危) is at 13° in *Hai*, it moves to 12° past *Zi* (子).

The boundaries of the celestial divisions are as follows:
- 5° in *Rooftop* marks the boundary of *Ren-Zi* (壬子);
- 9° in *Woman* (女) marks the boundary of *Zi-Gui* (子癸);
- 1° in *Ox* (牛) marks the boundary of *Gui-Chou* (癸丑);
- 11° in *Dipper* marks the boundary of *Chou-Gen* (丑艮);
- 6° in *Winnowing Basket* (箕) marks the boundary of *Gen-Yin* (艮寅);
- 11° in *Tail* marks the boundary of *Yin-Jia* (寅甲);
- 1° in *Heart* (心) marks the boundary of *Jia-Mao* (甲卯);
- 9° in *Root* marks the boundary of *Mao-Yi* (卯乙);
- 2° in *Neck* (亢) marks the boundary of *Yi-Chen* (乙辰);
- 17° in *Wings* (翰) marks the boundary of *Chen-Xun* (辰巽);
- 2° in *Dry* (干) marks the boundary of *Xun-Si* (巽巳);
- 6° in *Pivot* (斡) marks the boundary of *Si-Bing* (巳丙);
- 7° in *Spread* marks the boundary of *Bing-Wu* (丙午);
- 12° in *Willow* marks the boundary of *Wu-Ding* (午丁);
- The initial degree of *Ghost* (鬼) marks the boundary of *Ding-Wei* (丁未);
- The *Well*’s *Dou* (井斗) marks the boundary of *Wei-Kun* (未坤);
- 1° in *Well* marks the boundary of *Kun-Shen* (坤申);
- 14° in *Net* marks the boundary of *Shen-Geng* (申庚);
- 10° in *Pleiades* (昴) marks the boundary of *Geng-You* (庚酉);
- 11° in *Stomach* marks the boundary of *You-Xin* (酉辛);
- 8° in *Straddler* marks the boundary of *Xin-Xu* (辛戌);
- 9° in *Legs* (奎) marks the boundary of *Xu-Qian* (戌乾);
- 3° in *Wall* (壁) marks the boundary of *Qian-Hai* (乾亥);
- 5° in *House* (室) marks the boundary of *Hai-Ren* (亥壬).

Though the numbering appears reversed, the motion is in fact direct. The midpoint between 7° and 6° in *Void* (虛) is the center of *Zi* (子), while the midpoint between 6° and 5° in *Star* (星) is the center of *Wu* (午). The axis of transition between *Zi* and *Wu* is the pivot of palace traversal. While the sequence of degrees in each palace should ideally be corrected to proceed leftward in direct motion, this may startle beginners, so the old method may still be followed—provided that calculations are made with meticulous care.

**Chapter Forty-Two: On Determining Time**
Geomancy divides the land into forty-four mountains, while calendrical texts divide the day into twenty-four hours, each corresponding to a mountain. To determine time accurately, one must examine each hour and quarter-hour to ascertain the degrees of the constellations’ positions; otherwise, the timing will surely be amiss.

The twelve Earthly Branches denote fixed divisions, while the twelve Heavenly Stems occupy the intervals between them. For example:
- From the third quarter of *Hai* (亥) to the second quarter of *Zi* (子) belongs to *Ren* (壬);
- From the third quarter of *Zi* to the second quarter of *Zi* proper belongs to *Zi*;
- From the third quarter of *Zi* to the second quarter of *Chou* (丑) belongs to *Gui* (癸);
- From the third quarter of *Chou* to the second quarter of *Chou* proper belongs to *Chou*;
- From the third quarter of *Chou* to the second quarter of *Yin* (寅) belongs to *Gen* (艮);
- From the third quarter of *Yin* to the second quarter of *Yin* proper belongs to *Yin*;
- From the third quarter of *Yin* to the second quarter of *Mao* (卯) belongs to *Jia* (甲);
- From the third quarter of *Mao* to the second quarter of *Mao* proper belongs to *Mao*;
- From the third quarter of *Mao* to the second quarter of *Chen* (辰) belongs to *Yi* (乙);
- From the third quarter of *Chen* to the second quarter of *Chen* proper belongs to *Chen*;
- From the third quarter of *Chen* to the second quarter of *Si* (巳) belongs to *Xun* (巽);
- From the third quarter of *Si* to the second quarter of *Si* proper belongs to *Si*;
- From the third quarter of *Si* to the second quarter of *Wu* (午) belongs to *Bing* (丙);
- From the third quarter of *Wu* to the second quarter of *Wu* proper belongs to *Wu*;
- From the third quarter of *Wu* to the second quarter of *Wei* (未) belongs to *Ding* (丁);
- From the third quarter of *Wei* to the second quarter of *Wei* proper belongs to *Wei*;
- From the third quarter of *Wei* to the second quarter of *Shen* (申) belongs to *Kun* (坤);
- From the third quarter of *Shen* to the second quarter of *Shen* proper belongs to *Shen*;
- From the third quarter of *Shen* to the second quarter of *You* (酉) belongs to *Geng* (庚);
- From the third quarter of *You* to the second quarter of *You* proper belongs to *You*;
- From the third quarter of *You* to the second quarter of *Xu* (戌) belongs to *Xin* (辛);
- From the third quarter of *Xu* to the second quarter of *Xu* proper belongs to *Xu*;
- From the third quarter of *Xu* to the second quarter of *Hai* belongs to *Qian* (乾);
- From the third quarter of *Hai* to the second quarter of *Hai* proper belongs to *Hai*.

A day consists of twelve hours, totaling one hundred quarters. Each hour spans slightly more than eight quarters, hence the distinction between initial quarters and fractional quarters. When the twelve Heavenly Stems are included, each hour comprises just over four quarters.

For instance, in the first month, if the sun is at *Zi* (子) during the third quarter of *Mao* (卯), then *Yi* (乙) must correspond to *Gui* (癸), *Chen* (辰) to *Chou* (丑), and *Si* (巳) to *Gen* (艮), with the pattern continuing accordingly. Each day, the reckoning begins from the sun’s position at *Mao*, advancing one mountain per hour. However, around the Winter Solstice, the reckoning begins at *Chen* (辰), while around the Summer Solstice, it begins at *Yin* (寅).

The seven luminaries and comets all revolve leftward with time, except for *Ketu* and *Rahu*, which move rightward against the flow. This is the essential method for examining time to determine the positions of the stars—a principle scholars must not overlook.

**Chapter Forty-Three: On Astronomy**
Master Zhu said: The celestial Way, along with the sun, moon, and five planets, all revolve leftward. The celestial Way completes one circuit daily, always advancing by one degree.

The sun likewise completes one circuit of the heavens daily, beginning at the starting degree and ending at the starting degree. Thus, compared to the celestial Way, it always falls short by one degree. The moon’s motion falls short by thirteen and seven nineteenths of a degree. Modern scholars, however, claim that the moon moves swiftly while the sun moves slowly—this is a mistaken view. Astronomers, for the sake of convenience in observing the degrees of the sun and moon, adopt the theory of rightward rotation. Yet from Master Zhu’s words, we know that the seven luminaries all revolve leftward. Those who select auspicious times must not be ignorant of this. Today’s astrologers have strayed far from the truth.

Master Wu of Linchuan said: Since ancient times, astronomers have not been unaware that the seven luminaries also move leftward. However, their forward motion cannot be uniformly measured, so they calculate their retrograde motion to align with the celestial degrees, leading later generations to mistakenly believe that the sun, moon, and five planets move in reverse. Now, imagine an empty disk in the vastness of space, upon which the heavens and the seven luminaries move at varying speeds. The celestial Way moves fastest, advancing one degree beyond the empty disk each day. Saturn’s motion is slightly slower than the heavens; though it advances somewhat on the disk, over twenty-eight months, it falls thirty degrees short of the heavens. Jupiter’s motion is slower still; over twelve months, it lags thirty degrees behind the heavens. Mars moves even more slowly; over sixty days, it falls thirty degrees short. The sun’s motion is slower than Mars’s; on the celestial disk, it completes one full circuit daily without excess or deficit, yet compared to the heavens, it falls one degree short each day. Over one month, it falls thirty degrees short of the heavens. Venus moves slightly slower than the sun, though when its swift and slow phases balance, it matches the sun’s motion. Mercury moves slower than Venus, and when its swift and slow phases balance, it matches Venus’s motion. The moon moves slowest of all, sometimes falling twelve, thirteen, or fourteen degrees short of the heavens in a single day. Because its motion is so slow, its retrograde degree is greatest. Unaware of this, people mistake its motion for reverse movement and claim the moon is the fastest. Now, ranking their speeds: the heavens first, Saturn second, Jupiter third, Mars fourth, the sun fifth, Venus sixth, Mercury seventh, and the moon eighth. The heavens, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars move faster than the sun, while Venus, Mercury, and the moon move slower. This is the general principle. Examining these two accounts, we see that the heavens and the seven luminaries undoubtedly revolve leftward. Those who wish to master the subtle applications of time selection must not fail to investigate this.

Master Zhou of Taihe said: The heavens, being of pure yang essence, revolve leftward, completing one circuit each day and night while advancing an additional degree. The point where it advances becomes one degree of the celestial sphere, which is how the three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter degrees of the heavens originate. Saturn’s motion is next, falling thirty degrees short of the heavens over twenty-eight months. Jupiter follows, falling thirty degrees short over twelve months. Mars follows, falling thirty degrees short over two months. The sun follows, completing one circuit of the heavens daily but falling one degree short of the heavens. Over three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter days, the heavens’ advance precisely matches its original degree, while the sun’s lag also completes its original count, reuniting with the heavens at the initial cycle to form one year. Venus follows the sun, and Mercury follows Venus, though at times their swift and slow phases balance, allowing them to match the sun’s motion. The moon is the slowest, falling thirteen and seven nineteenths of a degree short of the heavens each day. Over twenty-nine and four hundred ninety-nine nine hundred fortieths of a day, it reunites with the sun to form one month. Twelve such conjunctions yield three hundred fifty-four and three hundred forty-eight nine hundred fortieths of a day, making one year. The moon’s motion follows this pattern. The heavens, sun, moon, and five planets all revolve leftward around the earth. The ancients spoke only of the heavens revolving leftward because the forward motion of the seven luminaries follows the heavens to the left, while their retrograde motion opposes the heavens to the right. Astronomers, finding the forward motion’s varying speeds difficult to calculate, instead track the retrograde motion for its simplicity in prediction, calling it rightward movement. Cai’s *Nine Spheres Calendar* from the Western Regions follows the same principle, so they must have known that all revolve leftward.

In the *Zi* month, the sun is in *Dou* (Dipper); at dusk, *Bi* (Wall) culminates, and at dawn, *Zhen* (Wing) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Xingji* (Stellar Mark).
In the *Chou* month, the sun is in *Nü* (Woman); at dusk, *Lou* (Harvester) culminates, and at dawn, *Shi* (House) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Xuanxiao* (Mystic Void).
In the *Yin* month, the sun is in *Shi* (House); at dusk, *Shen* (Triaster) culminates, and at dawn, *Wei* (Tail) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Juzhi* (Horned Branch).
In the *Mao* month, the sun is in *Kui* (Straddler); at dusk, *Hu* (Bow) culminates, and at dawn, *Jian* (Establishment) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Jianglou* (Descending Tower).
In the *Chen* month, the sun is in *Wei* (Stomach); at dusk, *Xing* (Star) culminates, and at dawn, *Dou* (Dipper) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Daliang* (Great Bridge).
In the *Si* month, the sun is in *Bi* (Net); at dusk, *Yi* (Wing) culminates, and at dawn, *Nü* (Woman) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Richen* (Sun’s Sinking).
In the *Wu* month, the sun is in *Jing* (Well); at dusk, *Kang* (Neck) culminates, and at dawn, *Wei* (Rooftop) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Chunshou* (Quail’s Head).
In the *Wei* month, the sun is in *Liu* (Willow); at dusk, *Huo* (Fire) culminates, and at dawn, *Kui* (Straddler) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Chunhuo* (Quail’s Fire).
In the *Shen* month, the sun is in *Yi* (Wing); at dusk, *Jian* culminates, and at dawn, *Bi* (Net) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Chunwei* (Quail’s Tail).
In the *You* month, the sun is in *Jiao* (Horn); at dusk and dawn, *Zi* (Turtle Beak) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Shouxing* (Longevity Star).
In the *Xu* month, the sun is in *Fang* (Room); at dusk, *Xu* (Void) culminates, and at dawn, *Liu* (Willow) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Dahuo* (Great Fire).
In the *Hai* month, the sun is in *Wei* (Tail); at dusk and dawn, *Xing* (Star) culminates, with the moon conjoining the sun in *Ximu* (Divided Tree).

All the above are indispensable for the practice of time selection.

**Chapter Forty-Four: On the Movements of Heaven**

The primordial *qi* of Heaven is formless, yet by observing the handle of the Dipper, one may know the celestial stems it points to. The Dipper consists of seven stars: the first is *Kui* (the Ladle), the fifth is *Heng* (the Balance), and the seventh is *Biao* (the Handle)—these three stars are called the "handle of the Dipper." For example, in the month of *Jianyin*, at dusk the handle points to *Yin*, at midnight the balance points to *Yin*, and at dawn the ladle points to *Yin*; other months follow this pattern.

When the Dipper points to the *Yin* and *Mao* months, it is auspicious to construct the Eastern Dragon. When it points to the *Si* and *Wu* months, it is auspicious to construct the Southern Dragon. When it points to the *Shen* and *You* months, it is auspicious to construct the Western Dragon. When it points to the *Hai* and *Zi* months, it is auspicious to construct the Northern Dragon. When it points to the *Chen*, *Xu*, *Chou*, and *Wei* months, it is auspicious to construct the Four-Corner Dragons.

The direction of the Dipper’s handle is where the primordial *qi* of Heaven resides. By aligning with this *qi* and acting accordingly, blessings come swiftly—like planting rice in spring and wheat in autumn, which invariably grow.

The *Juzī* mansion corresponds to the *Hai* (Pig) stem. This is the *fenye* of Wei, belonging to Bianzhou. Today, this includes Daming in Northern Zhili, and Zhangde, Huaiqing, and Weihui in Henan.

When constructing or burying, to determine a person’s scholarly rank or official post, one must not be ignorant of the following:

The four lodges *Jiao* (Horn), *Dou* (Dipper), *Kui* (Straddler), and *Jing* (Well) belong to Wood. Their *qi* aligns with winter, flourishes in spring. If Fire transits their degrees, it brings favor; if Metal transits, it brings enmity; if Water transits, it brings utility; if Earth transits, it brings difficulty. In summer and autumn, they are weak and in decline, and their fortunes are light.

The four lodges *Kang* (Neck), *Niu* (Ox), *Lou* (Harvester), and *Gui* (Ghost) belong to Metal. Their *qi* aligns with late summer, flourishes in autumn. If Water transits their degrees, it brings favor; if Fire transits, it brings enmity; if Earth transits, it brings utility; if Wood transits, it brings difficulty. In winter and spring, they are weak and in decline, and their fortunes are light.

The four lodges *Di* (Root), *Nü* (Girl), *Wei* (Stomach), and *Liu* (Willow) belong to Earth. Their *qi* aligns with summer, flourishes in late summer. If Metal transits their degrees, it brings favor; if Wood transits, it brings enmity; if Fire transits, it brings utility; if Water transits, it brings difficulty. In autumn and winter, they are weak and in decline, and their fortunes are shallow.

The four lodges *Fang* (Room), *Xu* (Void), *Xing* (Star), and *Mao* (Pleiades) belong to the Greater Yang. They are auspicious by day but inauspicious by night.

The four lodges *Xin* (Heart), *Wei* (Rooftop), *Bi* (Net), and *Zhang* (Spread) belong to the Greater Yin. They are auspicious by night but inauspicious by day.

The four lodges *Wei* (Tail), *Shi* (House), *Zi* (Turtle Beak), and *Yi* (Wing) belong to Fire. Their *qi* aligns with spring, flourishes in summer. If Earth transits their degrees, it brings favor; if Water transits, it brings enmity; if Wood transits, it brings utility; if Metal transits, it brings difficulty. In autumn and winter, they are weak and in decline, and their fortunes are also shallow.

The four lodges *Ji* (Winnowing Basket), *Bi* (Wall), *Shen* (Triaster), and *Wo* (Triaster) belong to Water. Their *qi* aligns with autumn, flourishes in winter. If Wood transits their degrees, it brings favor; if Earth transits, it brings enmity; if Metal transits, it brings utility; if Fire transits, it brings difficulty. In summer and autumn, they are weak and in decline, and their fortunes are also not heavy.

In all cases above, favor, utility, and flourishing bring auspiciousness, while weakness and decline bring misfortune. Enmity and difficulty, when flourishing, bring misfortune, but when weak and in decline, they bring auspiciousness.

**Chapter Forty-Six: On the Latitudinal Stars**

The sun is the essence of the Greater Yang and the symbol of the sovereign.

Its body spans one and a half degrees in diameter. Moving from east to west, it completes one celestial revolution each day, falling one degree short of the heavens’ motion. The path it traverses is called the *Yellow Way* (ecliptic), which intersects the *Red Way* (celestial equator). Half lies outside the Yellow Way, half within. On the winter solstice, the Yellow Way extends twenty-four degrees beyond the Red Way, reaching its farthest point from the North Pole. The sun rises at *chen* (7–9 a.m.) and sets at *shen* (3–5 p.m.), hence the cold season, short days, and long nights. On the summer solstice, the Yellow Way lies twenty-four degrees within the Red Way, closest to the North Pole. The sun rises at *yin* (3–5 a.m.) and sets at *xu* (7–9 p.m.), hence the hot season, long days, and short nights. At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the Yellow Way intersects the Red Way midway between the two poles. The sun rises at *mao* (5–7 a.m.) and sets at *you* (5–7 p.m.), hence the mild season and equal day and night.

The moon is the essence of the Greater Yin and the symbol of the empress and consorts. Its body also spans one and a half degrees in diameter. Moving from east to west, it completes one revolution daily, falling thirteen and thirty-seven hundredths degrees short of the heavens’ motion. In twenty-seven days, it retreats one full revolution. The path it traverses is called the *White Way* (lunar orbit), which intersects the Yellow Way, half lying within and half beyond, deviating no more than six degrees—just as the Yellow Way deviates twenty-four degrees from the Red Way.

The yang essence resembles fire, the yin essence resembles water. Fire emits light, while water reflects shadows. Thus, the moon’s light arises where the sun shines upon it, and its dark *po* (lunar essence) arises where the sun does not shine. When aligned with the sun, it is fully bright; when near the sun, its light is extinguished. When the sun and moon share the same degree, it is called *shuo* (new moon). Dividing the celestial sphere into four parts: on the eighth and twenty-third days, the moon’s motion brings it close to one part of the sun (*near-one*) and far from three parts (*far-three*), receiving varying degrees of sunlight. Thus, it is half-bright and half-dark, its *po* shaped like a drawn bow. At *shangxian* (first quarter), it appears at dusk, its light in the west. At *xiaxian* (last quarter), it appears at dawn, its light in the east. When it reaches the midpoint of the heavens, it is called *wang* (full moon). On the fifteenth day at dusk, the sun sets as the moon rises, facing each other from east and west, its light full and its *po* extinguished. When its light is fully spent, its body is restored—this is called *hui* (dark moon). On the thirtieth day, the moon nears the sun, and neither its light nor body is visible.

Whenever the sun and moon follow their proper degrees and their luminous influence aligns with the orientation of mountains, construction and burials are all auspicious. When the moon’s path along the White Way intersects the Yellow Way at a right angle, if this occurs at *shuo* (new moon), a solar eclipse results; if at *wang* (full moon), a lunar eclipse results. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon’s body obscures the sun’s light. A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon enters the dark void and does not receive the sun’s light. During solar or lunar eclipses, construction and burials must not be undertaken.

The five *wei* (wandering stars) are the essences of the Five Phases. Wood is called *Suixing* (Jupiter); in spring, it is the ruling star, suitable for invoking the Eastern Dragon. Fire is called *Yinghuo* (Mars); in summer, it is the ruling star, suitable for invoking the Southern Dragon. Earth is called *Zhenxing* (Saturn); in the four seasons, it is the ruling star, suitable for invoking the Dragons of the four corners. Metal is called *Taibai* (Venus); in autumn, it is the ruling star, suitable for invoking the Western Dragon. Water is called *Chenxing* (Mercury); in winter, it is the ruling star, suitable for invoking the Northern Dragon. Whenever solar or lunar eclipses or celestial anomalies occur, their auspices—whether fortunate or ominous—are divined based on the terrestrial region they traverse. Thus, those who practice selection must not be ignorant of this.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: On Star and Land Correlations**

Master *Bo* said: “The *fenye* (terrestrial correlations) of a given province or commandery can be determined—this is no idle claim. For the heavens have *fenxing* (stellar divisions), and the earth has *fenye* (terrestrial correlations), an unchanging correspondence of celestial influence and earthly response. For instance, if refined *sha* (sand) or *shui* (water) emerges in the *mao* (east) direction, it must signify that those born in *mao* will attain nobility. Or if in a *mao* or *yi* year one achieves official rank, this can be foretold. Alternatively, if refined *sha* or *shui* appears before a grave in the *you* (west) direction, one may predict that the occupant will hold office in the Zhao region. If refined *sha* or *shui* appears in the *xu* (northwest) direction, one may predict that the occupant will hold office in the Lu region. The rest can be inferred by analogy, and the responses are invariably accurate. However, this pertains only to the *sha* and *water* already present. One must also examine whether the *dragon* and *cavity* (geomantic features) are truly of noble configuration and whether the *qi* and fortune align with the prevailing direction—only then will predictions be infallible; otherwise, they will not hold.”

**Chapter Forty-Eight: On the Sovereign Star**

Master Zhu said: “The *Di* (Sovereign) is the ruler of heaven, and in selecting auspicious days, it must be given foremost consideration. Yet in common almanacs, discussions of the Sovereign Star are unverifiable. I have derived it from the *Yi* (Book of Changes) and the *Li* (Book of Rites). In the *Monthly Ordinances*, for the three spring months, it states: ‘Its sovereign is *Taihao*, its spirit *Gou Mang*—this is the lord of the green essence and the minister of the Wood Office, the so-called Green Sovereign.’ For the first and second summer months, it states: ‘Its sovereign is the *Yan Emperor*, its spirit *Zhu Rong*—this is the lord of the red essence and the minister of the Fire Office, the so-called Red Sovereign.’ For the last summer month, it states: ‘Its sovereign is the *Yellow Emperor*, its spirit *Hou Tu*—this is the lord of the yellow essence and the minister of the Earth Office, the so-called Yellow Sovereign.’ For the three autumn months, it states: ‘Its sovereign is *Shaohao*, its spirit *Rushou*—this is the lord of the white essence and the minister of the Metal Office, the so-called White Sovereign.’ For the three winter months, it states: ‘Its sovereign is *Zhuanxu*, its spirit *Xuan Ming*—this is the lord of the black essence and the minister of the Water Office, the so-called Black Sovereign.’

Furthermore, examining the *Xici* (Appended Judgments) of the *Yi*: ‘The Sovereign emerges from *Zhen* (Thunder), aligns with *Xun* (Wind), appears in *Li* (Fire), labors in *Kun* (Earth), rejoices in *Dui* (Lake), struggles in *Qian* (Heaven), toils in *Kan* (Water), and completes in *Gen* (Mountain).’ Viewed together, the ruler of heaven is one Sovereign. Divided, it becomes four; further divided, it becomes eight—and this is not the limit. Thus, from the three *hou* (five-day periods) of *Jingzhe* to *jia*, the three *hou* of the spring equinox to *mao*, and the three *hou* of *Qingming* to *yi*, this is what is meant by ‘the Sovereign emerges from *Zhen*.’ From the three *hou* of *Guyu* to *chen*, the three *hou* of *Lixia* to *xun*, and the three *hou* of *Xiaoman* to *si*, this is what is meant by ‘aligns with *Xun*.’”

The three *hou* of *Mangzhong* reach *bing*, the three *hou* of the summer solstice reach *wu*, and the three *hou* of *Xiaoshu* reach *ding*—this is what is meant by ‘appears in *Li*.’ The three *hou* of *Dashu* reach *wei*, the three *hou* of *Liqiu* reach *kun*, and the three *hou* of *Chushu* reach *shen*—this is what is meant by ‘labors in *Kun*.’ The three *hou* of *Bailu* reach *geng*, the three *hou* of the autumn equinox reach *you*, and the three *hou* of *Hanlu* reach *xin*—this is what is meant by ‘rejoices in *Dui*.’ The three *hou* of *Shuangjiang* reach *xu*, the three *hou* of *Lidong* reach *qian*, and the three *hou* of *Xiaoxue* reach *hai*—this is what is meant by ‘struggles in *Qian*.’ The three *hou* of *Daxue* reach *ren*, the three *hou* of the winter solstice reach *zi*, and the three *hou* of *Xiaohan* reach *gui*—this is what is meant by ‘toils in *Kan*.’ The three *hou* of *Dahan* reach *chou*, the three *hou* of *Lichun* reach *gen*, and the three *hou* of *Yushui* reach *yin*—this is what is meant by ‘completes in *Gen*.’ From the seventy-two *hou*, comprising 365¼ days, the pattern may be inferred.

Thus, the periods when the Sovereign arrives are auspicious times; the directions where the Sovereign descends are auspicious directions. Master Yang said: “In spring, acting in the east is auspicious; in summer, acting in the south is auspicious; in late summer, acting in the southwest is auspicious; in autumn, acting in the west is auspicious; in winter, acting in the north is auspicious”—this is the same principle. Today, people disregard the words of the classics and believe in baseless theories; their confusion is indeed profound.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: On the Five Stars and Resolving Doubts**
Some ask: “The east corresponds to wood, the south to fire, the west to metal, the north to water, and the four corners to earth—these are fixed positions. Yet the five stars also assign *zi* and *chou* to earth, *yin* and *hai* to wood, *mao* and *xu* to fire, *chen* and *you* to metal, *si* and *shen* to water, *wu* to the Greater Yang, and *wei* to the Greater Yin. Does this not mean that the five stars in heaven differ from the five phases on earth?”

It is said: The principles of the five stars and the five phases are one. *Zi* and *chou* are the root palaces of earth, not that *zi* and *chou* are earth in themselves. *Yin* and *hai* are the root palaces of wood, not that *yin* and *hai* are wood in themselves. *Mao* and *xu* are the root palaces of fire, not that *mao* and *xu* are fire in themselves. *Chen* and *you* are the root palaces of metal, not that *chen* and *you* are metal in themselves. *Si* and *shen* are the root palaces of water, not that *si* and *shen* are water in themselves. *Wu* is the palace of the Greater Yang, not that *wu* is the Greater Yang in itself. *Wei* is the palace of the Greater Yin, not that *wei* is the Greater Yin in itself. Just as metal is born in Lishui, one cannot directly equate Lishui with metal; jade emerges from Kunlun, yet one cannot directly equate Kunlun with jade.

Some ask: “Do the palaces where the seven luminaries reside also hold meaning?”
It is said: Among the celestial bodies, none are greater than the sun and moon. Thus, the sun resides in *wu*, and the moon in *wei*. Among earthly forms, none are greater than soil. Thus, soil resides in *zi* and *chou*. Among the movements between heaven and earth, none are greater than the four seasons. Thus, wood resides in *yin* and *hai*, corresponding to spring; fire resides in *mao* and *xu*, corresponding to summer; metal resides in *chen* and *you*, corresponding to autumn; water resides in *si* and *shen*, corresponding to winter. Within the span of a single star’s revolution, the great transformations of heaven and earth are contained. Thus, when Emperor Shun aligned the seven luminaries, was it without purpose? Clearly, the selection of the seven luminaries is of utmost importance.

Some further ask: “Among the twenty-eight constellations, there are stars named after days. *Xu* is the Rat Day, *Fang* is the Rabbit Day, and *Mao* is the Rooster Day. Does this mean there are four suns in heaven?”
It is said: No. These are all positions through which the Greater Yang flows. Just as the Son of Heaven in ancient times toured the four directions, each direction had its own Bright Hall—yet one would not directly equate the Bright Hall with the Son of Heaven. Moreover, the degrees of the twenty-eight constellations are all stages in the flow of the seven luminaries. This is akin to today’s provincial and prefectural officials, where each prefecture and county has its own traveling office. Those with keen insight will grasp this on their own.

**Chapter Fifty: On the Central Needle**
The ancients erected an eight-*chi* gnomon to determine the cardinal directions. The shadow of the sun in peripheral regions naturally differs from that in the central lands, for the mysterious needle moves yet remains constant. Yet this cannot be generalized; the *zi-wu* alignment for determining direction remains consistent everywhere. For instance, the ancients defined the “center” thus: in a hall, the center of the hall is the center; in a chamber, the center of the chamber is the center. Though the locations differ, each has its own center. Those who argue that the needle in peripheral regions differs from that in the central lands are mistaken. However, according to the theories of Lianzi, the *zi-wu* true needle slightly inclines toward *ren* and *bing*—this is a well-founded conclusion.

**Chapter Fifty-One: On the Two Luminaries**
Through observation, the Greater Yin and Greater Yang are the most auspicious deities in geomancy. Thus, in fate calculation and selection, they should be prioritized. All the foregoing discussions are based on the Greater Yin and Greater Yang. As for the five stars and four residues, they must be examined in real time and cannot be predetermined. Therefore, the following presents the fixed patterns of the two luminaries’ movements, so that even beginners without almanacs may seek auspiciousness and avoid misfortune.

The Greater Yang: Chen Tzu-hsien said: “The sun is the yang within yin, symbolizing the sovereign. Its virtue is utterly firm, its body utterly robust. Its movement through the heavens divides day and night, distinguishes cold and heat. It completes one revolution daily, falling short of the celestial sphere by one degree. Over a year, its cumulative motion precisely aligns with the heavens. Thus, the sun has three paths: the Yellow Path. When it reaches its northernmost point at Dongjing, it is closest to the pole; when it reaches its southernmost point at Qianniu, it is farthest from the pole. When it moves east to Jiao and west to Lou, it is at a median distance from the pole—these are the Central Path, Southern Path, and Northern Path, forming the three paths. When the southern pole extends to Qianniu, it marks the winter solstice, with forty *ke* of daylight and sixty *ke* of night.”

When the northern pole extends to Dongjing, it marks the summer solstice, with sixty *ke* of daylight and forty *ke* of night. Midway between the northern and southern poles, from Jiao in the east to Lou in the west, it marks the spring and autumn equinoxes, with fifty *ke* of daylight and fifty *ke* of night.

For the divisions of celestial motion: After the mid-*qi* of Rain Water in the first month, the sun enters the celestial lodge of Zī and Jūzǐ, corresponding to the stems *jiǎ*, *bǐng*, *gēng*, and *rén*. After the mid-*qi* of the Spring Equinox in the second month, the sun enters the lodge of Jiànglóu, corresponding to the trigrams *gèn*, *xùn*, *kūn*, and *qián*. After the mid-*qi* of Grain Rain in the third month, the sun enters the lodge of Dàliáng, corresponding to the stems *guǐ*, *yǐ*, *dīng*, and *xīn*. After the mid-*qi* of Lesser Fullness in the fourth month, the sun enters the lodge of Shíshěn, corresponding to *jiǎ*, *bǐng*, *gēng*, and *rén*. After the mid-*qi* of the Summer Solstice in the fifth month, the sun enters the lodge of Chúnshǒu, corresponding to *qián*, *kūn*, *gèn*, and *xùn*. After the mid-*qi* of Great Heat in the sixth month, the sun enters the lodge of Chúnhuǒ, corresponding to *guǐ*, *yǐ*, *dīng*, and *xīn*. After the mid-*qi* of Ending Heat in the seventh month, the sun enters the lodge of Chúnwěi, corresponding to *jiǎ*, *bǐng*, *gēng*, and *rén*. After the mid-*qi* of the Autumn Equinox in the eighth month, the sun enters the lodge of Shòuxīng, corresponding to *qián*, *kūn*, *gèn*, and *xùn*. After the mid-*qi* of Frost Descent in the ninth month, the sun enters the lodge of Dàhuǒ, corresponding to *guǐ*, *yǐ*, *dīng*, and *xīn*. After the mid-*qi* of Lesser Snow in the tenth month, the sun enters the lodge of Xīmù, corresponding to *bǐng*, *gēng*, *jiǎ*, and *rén*. After the mid-*qi* of the Winter Solstice in the eleventh month, the sun enters the lodge of Xīngjì, corresponding to *gèn*, *xùn*, *kūn*, and *qián*. After the mid-*qi* of Great Cold in the twelfth month, the sun enters the lodge of Xuánléng, corresponding to *yǐ*, *dīng*, *xīn*, and *guǐ*.

The regions it traverses are the directions illuminated by its light, where one may erect gnomons in the three cardinal and four orthogonal directions to harness its radiance. These are called the "mountain dwellers' imperial chariot stations," known as the *suìkōng*, where all celestial stars and terrestrial *sha* may be subdued. When the sun enters the lodges of Fáng, Xū, or Mǎo, it is termed the "sun ascending its palace," and its use is especially auspicious. If a solar eclipse or celestial anomaly occurs, it is most inauspicious and must be strictly avoided.

The moon, as stated by Chen Xiyi: The moon is the yin within yang, symbolizing the empress and consorts. Its virtue is utterly yielding, its body utterly compliant, and its movement through the heavens assists in regulating the sun, verified by the waxing and waning of nocturnal shadows. The moon itself possesses no light but borrows brightness from the sun. In terms of its unilluminated body, it is purely yin, resembling *kūn*. At the time of the new moon, after three days, it has not yet traversed thirty-seven degrees; as it begins to brighten, it first draws upon the sun’s light, hence called *shuò*, signifying the initial arising of yang. Visible at dusk in the *gēng* direction, after eight days, it has not yet traversed ninety-eight degrees; drawing upon half the sun’s brightness, it is called the "first quarter," signifying yang’s near-completion. Visible at dusk in the *dīng* direction, after fifteen days, it has not yet traversed 182.5 degrees; opposing the sun in full view, it draws upon the sun’s full brightness to become perfectly round, hence called *wàng*, signifying the full manifestation of the three yangs. Visible at dusk in the *jiǎ* direction, after another three days, it has not yet traversed 195 degrees; as the lunar essence begins to wane, it deviates from the full-moon opposition, and the yin essence begins to arise, hence called *pò*, signifying the return of yin. Visible at dawn in the *xīn* direction, after another five days, it has not yet traversed eighty-one degrees; half-obscured, it draws upon half the sun’s brightness, hence called the "last quarter," signifying yin’s growth to half. Visible at dawn in the *bǐng* direction, after another six days, it has fallen short of completing 365.25 degrees by 490 parts; reuniting with the sun, the moon’s brightness can no longer draw upon the sun’s, returning to obscurity, hence called *huì*, vanishing entirely at *yǐ*.

In its celestial motion, the moon traverses 352 degrees and 828.6 *lǐ* in a day, falling short of the sun by 12 degrees and 1/19 of a degree; in the heavens, it falls short by 13 degrees and 7/19 of a degree. Accumulating 29 and 499/940 days, it reunites with the sun at the celestial lodge, forming one month of twelve conjunctions. Accumulating 354 and 348/949 days, it reunites with the heavens, forming one year.

Thus, the moon has nine paths. The nine paths consist of two black paths emerging north of the Yellow Path, two red paths emerging south of the Yellow Path, two white paths emerging west of the Yellow Path, and two blue-green paths emerging east of the Yellow Path, together with the Yellow Path, totaling nine.

At the Beginning of Spring and the Spring Equinox, it follows the blue-green path, dividing degrees at *jiǎ*; at the Beginning of Autumn and the Autumn Equinox, it follows the white path, dividing degrees at *gēng*; at the Beginning of Winter and the Winter Solstice, it follows the black path, dividing degrees at *rén*; at the Beginning of Summer and the Summer Solstice, it follows the red path, dividing degrees at *bǐng*. The times when the sun and moon conjoin in degree, and the directions where the three conjunctions shine, are the stars of Celestial Virtue and Lunar Virtue.

Thus, in the third month, when the branch is *chén*, the sun and moon conjoin at *yǒu*, emerging at *gēng* and entering the palace at *rén*, hence Celestial and Lunar Virtue reside in *rén*. In the sixth month, when the branch is *wèi*, the sun and moon conjoin at *wǔ*, emerging at *bǐng* and entering the palace at *jiǎ*, hence the two virtues reside in *jiǎ*. In the ninth month, when the branch is *xū*, the sun and moon conjoin at *mǎo*, emerging at *jiǎ* and entering the palace at *bǐng*, hence the two virtues reside in *bǐng*. In the twelfth month, when the branch is *chǒu*, the sun and moon conjoin at *zǐ*, emerging at *rén* and entering the palace at *gēng*, hence the two virtues reside in *gēng*. As *zǐ* and *wǔ* mark the sun and moon’s beginning and end, and *mǎo* and *yǒu* their rising and setting, their divisions are many, giving rise to the Greater Yang and Greater Yin.

The other months when the moon enters its palace are times when the Greater Yin ascends its throne, where gnomons may be erected, and all celestial luminaries and terrestrial *sha* may be subdued.

If a lunar eclipse or celestial anomaly occurs, it portends great misfortune.

The above are the fixed degrees of the sun and moon’s movements, verified in their time and unchanging.

Once the palaces of the sun and moon are determined, the life palace and body palace may be known, and the five planets and four residues may be deduced. This is the essential task of electional astrology; scholars must prioritize it above all.

**Chapter Fifty-Two: On the Celestial Mechanism** *(Chapters 52–60 are discourses by Master Lǐ of Ráo’ān)*

The Wood Virtue of the East is called the Year Star,
Its color ever green, its motion marked by stations and retrogradations.
Its regular path is recorded in the almanacs;
When stationary, it is called the Star of Prolonged Mourning,
Boding fortune or disaster.
When retrograde, it is named the Star of Calamity and Sorrow,
Presaging misfortune of no small weight.
When hidden, it is called the Heavenly Barrier,
Neutral in fortune or harm.

When this star follows its proper course unobstructed,
Fortune arrives swiftly.
If it meets a malefic star while in direct motion,
Its benefic power is halved.
It traverses one degree in six days—
This is no ordinary path.
Sometimes it moves one degree in three days,
Or completes a cycle in five.
Generally, it shifts one palace per year,
This is its general progression.
In twelve years, it completes a minor cycle;
Its precise degrees must be carefully examined.
After eighty-two years,
It completes a grand celestial circuit.

If the Eastern Dragon is encountered,
Great undertakings may be established,
And all celestial omens and terrestrial *sha* subdued.
When it enters *Jiǎo*, *Dǒu*, or *Kuí*, it is in its temple;
When in *Jī*, *Bì*, *Shēn*, or *Gě*, it gains power.
Direct motion is auspicious; hidden or retrograde, inauspicious.

**Chapter Fifty-Three: On Mars**

The Fire Spirit of the South is called *Yínghuò*,
Its celestial form distinctly arrayed.
Its motion swift or slow, direct or retrograde,
Its stations and occultations must be closely observed.
Slow, stationary, hidden, or retrograde—all portend disaster;
Direct motion brings fortune.

When stationary, it is renamed the Star of Heavenly Rainbow,
Most ominous, heralding fire.
When retrograde, it is called the Star of Heavenly Destruction,
Bringing pestilence and celestial punishment.
When hidden, it is named the Black Celestial Luminary,
Wreaking havoc with utmost cruelty.

When entering its palace, it brings joy and prosperity,
Its radiance shining with literary brilliance.
Its motion demands meticulous scrutiny—
Do not treat it as an ordinary star.
It traverses one degree in eighteen hours,
Following its direct path.
It shifts one palace in fifty days,
A time when all actions may be undertaken.
Fortune is bestowed during this period,
And all orientations are auspicious.
If it further enters a palace of prosperity,
It hastens spring’s arrival like the wind.

This star governs literary eminence and official rank,
Bestowing examination success and imperial favor.
It also heralds child prodigies entering the imperial court,
And ministers drawing near the throne.

If it moves slowly, stations, or retrogrades,
It traverses one degree in two days.
Two months pass before it crosses one palace—
This is an extremely inauspicious time.
When swift, it covers five degrees in seven days,
Or one palace in forty-five days.
When slow and retrograde, it may take three or four months
To traverse a single palace.
In two years, it completes a minor cycle—
A subtle art not lightly transmitted.
In seventy-nine years,
It completes a grand celestial circuit.

If the Southern Dragon is encountered,
Great undertakings may be established,
And the three harmonies and four cardinal directions are also auspicious.
When it enters *Wěi*, *Shì*, *Zī*, or *Yì*, it is in its temple;
When in *Dǒu*, *Jiǎo*, *Kuí*, or *Jǐng*, it gains power.
All celestial omens and terrestrial *sha* may be subdued.
Direct motion is auspicious; hidden or retrograde, inauspicious.

**Chapter Fifty-Four: On Saturn**

The Earth Virtue of the Center is called the Quelling Star,
The essence of *wù* and *jǐ* earth.
In the classics, it is also called the Earthly Net and Throat,
Its fortune and misfortune requiring careful examination.
Its motion marked by occultations, retrogradations, slowness, and directness,
Each aspect must be meticulously analyzed.

When hidden, it is called the Plague Star,
To be feared, for its calamities are grave.
In the Jin dynasty, it was also named the Dark Luminary,
Presaging disaster.
When retrograde, it is called the Star of Household Ruin,
Bringing sudden misfortune upon encounter.

When it enters its palace in direct motion,
Wealth and nobility flourish enduringly.
If it meets the Moon’s Comet in the same palace,
Fortune and misfortune are evenly matched.

It shifts one palace every three years,
Following both major and minor cycles.
Fifty-nine years mark its full period,
Its weighty nature making its motion slow.

If the Western Dragon is encountered,
Great undertakings may be established,
And all celestial omens and terrestrial *sha* subdued.
When it enters *Dī*, *Nǚ*, *Wèi*, or *Liǔ*, it is in its temple;
When in *Wěi*, *Shì*, *Zī*, *Zhāng*, or *Yì*, it gains power.
Direct motion is auspicious; hidden or retrograde, inauspicious.

---

**Chapter Fifty-Five: On Venus**

The Metal Star of the West is called *Tàibái*,
Also known as the Long Dusk.
Its motion marked by slowness, stations, directness, and retrogradation,
Its morning and evening apparitions distinguished.
*(To be continued...)*

**Chapter Fifty-Five: On Venus (continued)**

When it lies hidden yet follows the seasons, moving in direct motion,
Its blessings are truly unmatched.
If it strays from its proper path across the heavens, it is not fitting—
War and disaster follow in its wake.
When sharing a palace with Mars, it is constrained;
At such times, what merit does it hold?
When sharing a palace with Saturn, it is most fitting,
And its felicitous influence surpasses the norm.
When it is slow, retrograde, or merely slow in motion,
There is no misfortune, and even blessings are light.
Only fear its conjunction with *Bó* and *Luó-Jì*—
Their baleful power must not be encountered.
When the Sun, Moon, or Mercury join it in position,
One ascends to the imperial examinations in a single stroke.
Its motion is half a degree per day,
And it traverses one palace each month.
In a year, it completes a circuit of the heavens,
Ever aligned with the celestial degrees.
How long is its great annual cycle?
Mark it well: eight months.
This star, in general, brings no calamity—
Where it appears, fortune and grace arrive.
When it illuminates three directions, it brings great benefit,
And it delights especially in gathering with the Sun.
When it enters its temple and ascends the throne, joy fills the heart,
And high office reaches the Three Terraces.
If it meets Jupiter in the same palace,
The enemy state’s wealth may be spoken of.

The Western Dragon, when encountered,
Allows great undertakings to be established,
And all celestial omens and terrestrial *sha* subdued.
When in *Kàng*, *Niú*, *Lóu*, or *Guǐ*, it is in its temple;
When in *Shì*, *Nǚ*, *Wèi*, or *Liǔ*, it gains power.
Direct motion is auspicious; hidden or retrograde, inauspicious.

---

**Chapter Fifty-Six: On Mercury**

The Water Virtue of the North is called *Chénxīng*,
Its celestial image arrayed in the heavenly court.
Its motion marked by swiftness, slowness, concealment, and retrogradation,
Yet it is always direct, never retrograde.
This star, in general, governs auspiciousness—
When it meets the Sun, blessings are boundless.
If it is slow or retrograde, its power slightly wanes,
And when *Bó* or Mars join it, they move in opposition.
Its path ever near the Sun’s side,
It serves as the sovereign’s assistant.
It moves one and a half degrees each day,
And traverses one palace each month.
When slow, it takes sixty-nine days to shift;
When swift, twenty days suffice.
At its swiftest, it passes one palace in seventeen days,
Its monthly motion never the same.
In general, it completes a minor cycle in a year,
Its precise degrees requiring careful observation.
Sixty-five years mark its great celestial circuit—
Its subtle secrets cannot be fully spoken.

The Northern Dragon, when encountered,
Allows great undertakings to be established,
And all celestial omens and terrestrial *sha* subdued without question.
When in *Jī*, *Bì*, *Shēn*, or *Hàn*, it is in its temple;
When in *Kàng*, *Niú*, *Lóu*, or *Guǐ*, it gains power.
Direct motion is auspicious; hidden or retrograde, inauspicious.

**Chapter Fifty-Seven: On the Purple Qi**

The residue of Jupiter becomes the Purple Qi,
The greatest source of fortune.
Auspicious signs and joyous omens meet in its presence,
And all endeavors reach fulfillment.
This star, in general, brings abundant blessings,
Its nature benevolent, free of malice.
When it enters its temple and flourishes, its joy is extraordinary—
Its precise degrees may be carefully calculated.
Its motion is always direct, easy to seek;
It knows no slowness, retrogradation, concealment, or stations.
In general, it moves one degree each month,
And completes twelve degrees in a year.
Three years pass before it traverses one palace—
This is its fixed course.
After circling the heavens in a great cycle,
Twenty-eight springs have turned.

The Southeast Dragon is most fitting.

---

**Chapter Fifty-Eight: On the Moon’s *Bó***

The Moon’s *Bó* is mostly the essence of Water,
Named the Great Yin Spirit,
Also called the Broomstar, the Great General—
Its aid in misfortune and fortune runs deep.
When the Five Stars move in direct motion and meet it,
It may also assist in bringing blessings.
But if it meets retrograde stars, it is most baleful—
When it meets *Bó*, great misfortune arises.
When the Moon’s *Bó* enters a palace or its temple,
Observe the other stars to discern fortune or misfortune.
If the other stars are baleful, it augments their balefulness;
If they are auspicious, it follows their auspiciousness.
Its motion knows no slowness, stations, or retrogradation—
It traverses three degrees each month.
In nine months, it passes one palace,
Its motion following a constant path.
How many degrees does it traverse in twelve months?
Exactly forty-nine.
When does it complete a minor celestial circuit?
Its precise degrees are best carefully calculated.
Sixty-two years complete its celestial circuit—
The celestial degrees must be examined in detail.

The Northeast Dragon is most fitting.

---

**Chapter Fifty-Nine: On *Luó* and *Huì***

*Luó* and *Huì* are the residue of Water,
Their names at the Celestial Head unchanging.
When they do not meet inauspicious stars, they hold the greatest power—
Fortune and misfortune must be carefully calculated.
They know no concealment, retrogradation, slowness, or stations,
Ever moving in retrograde motion.
This star, in general, is baleful in nature,
Its power to bring blessings entirely weak.
At the new moon, when it shares a degree with the Sun,
A solar eclipse is certain, without doubt.
At the full moon, when it shares a degree with the Moon,
A lunar eclipse portends misfortune.
When it causes an eclipse, it is most ominous—
No affair can withstand its encounter.
Only when it enters its temple and meets Mars
Does its power to assist in blessings become significant.
It moves one degree every nineteen days,
And traverses half a degree each month.
Eighteen months pass before it shifts one palace—
All calendars agree on this.
Nineteen years mark its minor cycle,
Each step moving in retrograde motion.
Ninety-three years complete its great cycle—
The celestial mechanism must not be carelessly transmitted.

The Fire and Earth Dragons are most fitting.

---

**Chapter Sixty: On *Jìdū***

The residue of Earth is called the star *Jìdū*,
The Eclipse Spirit, known as the Leopard’s Tail.
This star’s nature resembles *Luó* and *Huì*—
Mostly baleful, with little good, meeting retrogradation.
Its constant motion has no form,
Nor does it require discussion of concealment or slowness.
When it shares a degree with the Sun or Moon, an eclipse occurs—
Its malevolence is most inauspicious.
When it enters a palace or its temple, observe the accompanying stars—
Fortune and misfortune yet follow one another.
When Mars and Saturn share its palace in direct motion,
Its blessings are beyond doubt.
But if Mars and Saturn are hidden or retrograde,
Calamity descends from the heavens.
Its motion is always opposite to Mars and *Luó*—
It knows no stations, directness, or retrogradation.
It moves one degree every nineteen days,
And traverses half a degree each month.
A year and a half passes before it shifts one palace,
Its minor cycle completed in nineteen years.
Ninety-three years mark its great cycle—
Its revolutions never cease.

The Earth and Metal Dragons are most fitting.

### **Introduction to Selection Principles**
This work on selection embodies principles timeless across past and present, serving to complement the application of dragon veins, burial sites, mountains, and waterways. Yet the fixed nature of yin and yang, the inherent qualities of the Five Phases, and the various auspicious and inauspicious stellar configurations must first be understood. Thus, these principles are outlined in advance for the benefit of beginners.

For burials, one need not rigidly adhere to major or minor burial days. For constructions, one need not strictly observe major or minor construction days. As long as the dragon spirit harmonizes with the balanced *qi*, the sitting direction aligns with auspicious stars, mutual support fortifies destiny, and the land meets the demands of the time, it suffices. However, the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of stellar positions in the sitting direction must be determined primarily by the Seven Governors; one must not be misled by heterodox teachings.

### **Principles of Dragon Veins, Burial Sites, Yin-Yang, and the Five Phases**
From three degrees in *Dǒu* within the *Yín* palace to three degrees at the center of *Mǎo*, all belong to yang wood.
From four degrees in *Xīn* within the *Mǎo* palace to eleven degrees in *Jiǎo* at the center of *Chén*, all belong to yin wood.
From nine degrees in *Zhóu* within the *Sì* palace to nine degrees in *Zhāng* at the center of *Wǔ*, all belong to yin fire.
From eight degrees in *Zhāng* within the *Wǔ* palace to twenty-seven degrees in *Jǐng* at the center of *Wèi*, all belong to yang fire.
From eight degrees in *Jǐng* within the *Shēn* palace to one degree in *Bì* at the center of *Yǒu*, all belong to yang metal.
From two degrees in *Bì* within the *Yǒu* palace to four degrees in *Lóu* at the center of *Xū*, all belong to yin metal.
From one degree in *Kuí* within the *Hài* palace to seven degrees in *Wēi* at the center of *Zǐ*, all belong to yin water.
From six degrees in *Wēi* within the *Zǐ* palace to twenty-two degrees in *Dǒu* at the center of *Chǒu*, all belong to yang water.
The last eighteen degrees of *Chén* and the last eighteen degrees of *Xū* belong to yang earth.
The last eighteen degrees of *Chǒu* and the last eighteen degrees of *Wèi* belong to yin earth.

### **Principles of Yin-Yang in Years, Months, Days, and Hours**
*Jiǎ*, *Bǐng*, *Wù*, *Gēng*, and *Rén* are yang celestial stems;
*Yǐ*, *Xīn*, *Jǐ*, *Dīng*, and *Guǐ* are yin celestial stems.
*Zǐ*, *Yín*, *Chén*, *Wǔ*, *Shēn*, and *Xū* are yang earthly branches;
*Chǒu*, *Mǎo*, *Sì*, *Wèi*, *Yǒu*, and *Hài* are yin earthly branches.

### **Principles of the Five Phases in Years, Months, Days, and Hours**
*Jiǎ*, *Yǐ*, *Yín*, and *Mǎo* belong to wood;
*Bǐng*, *Dīng*, *Sì*, and *Wǔ* belong to fire;
*Wù*, *Jǐ*, *Chén*, *Xū*, *Chǒu*, and *Wèi* belong to earth;
*Gēng*, *Xīn*, *Shēn*, and *Yǒu* belong to metal;
*Rén*, *Guǐ*, *Hài*, and *Zǐ* belong to water.

### **Principles of Yin-Yang and the Five Phases in the Four Seasons**
The thirty-six days after *Lìchūn* belong to yang wood; the next thirty-six days belong to yin wood; the following eighteen days belong to yang earth.
The thirty-six days after *Lìxià* belong to yin fire; the next thirty-six days belong to yang fire; the following eighteen days belong to yin earth.
The thirty-six days after *Lìqiū* belong to yang metal; the next thirty-six days belong to yin metal; the following eighteen days belong to yang earth.
The thirty-six days after *Lìdōng* belong to yin water; the next thirty-six days belong to yang water; the following eighteen days belong to yin earth.

### **Principles of the Three Origins**
The ten celestial stems are the *Tiānyuán* (Heavenly Origin); the twelve earthly branches are the *Dìyuán* (Earthly Origin).
Within *Zǐ* lies *Guǐ* and water; within *Chǒu* lie *Guǐ*, *Sì*, and *Xīn*; within *Yín* lie *Jiǎ*, *Bǐng*, and *Wù*; within *Mǎo* lies *Yǐ* and wood; within *Chén* lie *Yǐ*, *Guǐ*, and *Wù*; within *Sì* lie *Bǐng*, *Wù*, and *Gēng*; within *Wǔ* lie *Dīng* and *Jǐ*; within *Wèi* lie *Yǐ*, *Jǐ*, and *Dīng*; within *Shēn* lie *Gēng*, *Rén*, and *Wù*; within *Yǒu* lie *Xīn* and metal; within *Xū* lie *Xīn*, *Dīng*, and *Wù*; within *Hài* lie *Rén* and *Jiǎ*—these are all the *Rényuán* (Human Origin).

### **Principles of the Life and Death of the Five Phases**
*Jiǎ* wood is born in *Hài* and dies in *Wǔ*;
*Yǐ* wood is born in *Wǔ* and dies in *Hài*;
*Bǐng* and *Wù* are born in *Yín* and die in *Yǒu*;
*Dīng* and *Jǐ* are born in *Yǒu* and die in *Yín*;
*Gēng* metal is born in *Sì* and dies in *Zǐ*;
*Xīn* metal is born in *Zǐ* and dies in *Sì*;
*Rén* water is born in *Shēn* and dies in *Mǎo*;
*Guǐ* water is born in *Mǎo* and dies in *Shēn*.
For rituals such as bathing and capping, begin from the *chángshēng* (birth) position. The sequence is: *chángshēng* (birth), *mùyù* (bathing), *guāndài* (capping), *línguān* (official position), *dìwàng* (prosperity), *shuāi* (decline), *bìng* (illness), *sǐ* (death), *mù* (tomb), *jué* (extinction), *tāi* (embryo), and *yǎng* (nurturing).

### **Principles of the Generation and Conquest of the Five Phases**
Wood generates fire; fire generates earth; earth generates metal; metal generates water; water generates wood—this is the mutual generation of the Five Phases.
Wood conquers earth; earth conquers water; water conquers fire; fire conquers metal; metal conquers wood—this is the mutual conquest of the Five Phases.

### **Principles of the Classic Stars**
*Wēi* 12 passes *Zǐ*; *Nǚ* 1 passes *Chǒu*; *Dǒu* 3 passes *Yín*; *Wěi* 2 passes *Mǎo*; *Shì* 1 passes *Chén*; *Hàn* 9 passes *Sì*; *Zhāng* 14 passes *Wǔ*; *Liǔ* 4 passes *Wèi*; *Jǐng* 8 passes *Shēn*; *Bì* 6 passes *Yǒu*; *Wèi* 3 passes *Xū*; *Kuí* 1 passes *Hài*.
*Xīng*, *Xū*, *Fáng*, and *Mǎo* are the positions of the sun;
*Zhāng*, *Wēi*, *Xīn*, and *Bì* are the positions of the moon;
*Jiǎo*, *Dǒu*, *Kuí*, and *Jǐng* are the positions of Jupiter;
*Wěi*, *Shì*, *Zī*, and *Yì* are the positions of Mars;
*Shì*, *Nǚ*, *Wèi*, and *Liǔ* are the positions of Saturn;
*Kàng*, *Niú*, *Lóu*, and *Guǐ* are the positions of Venus;
*Jī*, *Bì*, *Shēn*, and *Sōng* are the positions of Mercury.

### **Principles of the Weft Stars**
*Zǐ* and *Chǒu* are the positions of earth;
*Yín* and *Hài* are the positions of wood;
*Mǎo* and *Xū* are the positions of fire;
*Chén* and *Yǒu* are the positions of metal;
*Sì* and *Shēn* are the positions of water;
*Wǔ* is the position of the sun;
*Wèi* is the position of the moon.

The remaining stars are calculated as attached slaves: *Zǐ* (black) attaches to *Yín*, *Bèi* attaches to *Shēn*, and *Luó* attaches to *Xū*.

### **Principles of the Life Palace**
The palace where the sun arrives is the Life Palace; the degree where the sun resides is the Life Degree.
For example, on the fourteenth day of the first month in the *Guǐ-Wèi* year of the *Wàn-Lì* reign, at the *Mǎo* hour, the sun is at *Xū* 1° in the *Zǐ* Palace—thus, earth is the palace’s ruling star, and the sun is the degree’s ruling star.
At the *Chén* hour, the sun reaches *Jǐng* 3° in the *Chǒu* Palace—thus, earth remains the palace’s ruling star, while wood becomes the degree’s ruling star. Other cases follow this pattern.

### **Principles of the Body Palace**
The palace where the moon arrives is the Body Palace; the degree where the moon resides is the Body Degree.
For example, on the fourteenth day of the first month in the *Guǐ-Wèi* year of the *Wàn-Lì* reign, at the third quarter of the *Mǎo* hour, the moon reaches *Liǔ* 5° in the *Wǔ* Palace—thus, the moon is the palace’s ruling star, and earth is the degree’s ruling star.
At the *Chén* hour, the moon reaches *Jǐng* 10° in the *Wèi* Palace—thus, the moon remains the palace’s ruling star, while wood becomes the degree’s ruling star. Other cases follow this pattern.

### **Principles of the Annual Star**
Spring is wood, summer is fire, autumn is metal, winter is water; in the four seasonal months, it is earth.

### **Principles of the Active Star**
Wood meets fire, fire meets earth, earth meets metal, metal meets water, water meets wood.

### **Principles of Favor, Birth, Enmity, and Hardship**
That which gives me life is favor; that which restricts me is hardship; that which I restrict is enmity; that which I occupy is the host.

### **Principles for Determining Months from Years**
For *Jiǎ* and *Jǐ* years, *Bǐng* leads;
For *Yǐ* and *Gēng* years, *Wù* heads;
For *Bǐng* and *Xīn* years, begin with *Gēng*;
For *Dīng* and *Rén* years, follow *Rén* in sequence;
As for *Wù* and *Guǐ*, where do they start? Seek carefully from *Jiǎ-Yín*.
For example, in a *Jiǎ* or *Jǐ* year, the first month begins with *Bǐng-Yín*, the second month is *Dīng-Mǎo*, the third month is *Wù-Chén*, and so on in sequence. Other cases follow this pattern.

### **Principles for Determining Hours from Days**
For *Jiǎ* and *Jǐ* days, add *Jiǎ*;
For *Yǐ* and *Gēng* days, *Bǐng* begins;
For *Bǐng* and *Xīn* days, start with *Wù*;
For *Dīng* and *Rén* days, *Gēng-Zǐ* resides;
Where does *Wù* and *Guǐ* begin? *Rén-Zǐ* is the true path.
For example, on a *Jiǎ* or *Jǐ* day, the *Zǐ* hour begins with *Jiǎ-Zǐ*, the *Chǒu* hour is *Yǐ-Chǒu*, the *Yín* hour is *Bǐng-Yín*, and so on in sequence. Other cases follow this pattern.

### **Principles of the Great Fortune Cycle**
*Jiǎ*, *Bǐng*, *Wù*, *Gēng*, and *Rén* are yang years.
*Yǐ*, *Xīn*, *Jǐ*, *Dīng*, and *Guǐ* are yin years.
For house construction, in yang years proceed forward, in yin years proceed backward—this aligns with determining the fortune cycle for men in fate calculation.
For burials, in yang years proceed backward, in yin years proceed forward—this aligns with determining the fortune cycle for women in fate calculation.
In all cases, begin from the monthly command.
For example, in a *Jiǎ-Zǐ* year, the second month is *Dīng-Mǎo*; proceeding forward, the fortune cycle begins with *Wù-Chén*, then *Jǐ-Sì*, *Gēng-Wǔ*, and so on in sequence.
Proceeding backward, the fortune cycle begins with *Bǐng-Yín*, then *Yǐ-Chǒu*, *Jiǎ-Zǐ*, *Guǐ-Hài*, and so on in sequence. In all cases, consider the earthly branches, not the heavenly stems. Other cases follow this pattern.

### **Principles for Calculating Years in the Great Fortune Cycle**
Each month has a solar term preceding and a mid-term following, such as *Lì-Chūn* (Beginning of Spring) as the solar term and *Yǔ-Shuǐ* (Rain Water) as the mid-term—this applies to both days and months.
In the great fortune cycle, only the solar terms are considered, not the mid-terms.
In yang years, observe the preceding solar term; in yin years, observe the following solar term.
Every three days count as one year in the calculation.
For example, in a yang year, if an event occurs three days before *Lì-Chūn*, it is counted as the first year of the fortune cycle. If it occurs six days before, it is the second year; nine days before, the third year; twelve days before, the fourth year; fifteen days before, the fifth year. Other cases follow this pattern.
In a yin year, if an event occurs three days after *Lì-Chūn*, it is the first year of the fortune cycle. If it occurs six days after, it is the second year; nine days after, the third year; twelve days after, the fourth year; fifteen days after, the fifth year. Other cases follow this pattern.
If there is a remainder of one day, it is disregarded. If there is a remainder of two days, it is counted as three days. If there is a remainder of one and a half days, it is counted as half a year.

### **Principles of the Minor Fortune Cycle**
In determining the minor fortune cycle, the heavenly stem of the year’s ruling star is taken as the primary star.
Fate calculators also say: "The year uses the heavenly stem, the fortune cycle uses the earthly branch"—this is the same principle.
For example, in *Jiǎ* and *Yǐ* years, wood is the minor fortune cycle; in *Bǐng* and *Dīng* years, fire is the minor fortune cycle; in *Wù* and *Jǐ* years, earth is the minor fortune cycle; in *Gēng* and *Xīn* years, metal is the minor fortune cycle; in *Rén* and *Guǐ* years, water is the minor fortune cycle—this aligns with the yearly fortune cycle in fate calculation.
Additionally, the monthly command for determining the fortune cycle follows the same principles as the great fortune cycle. The daily spirit for determining the fortune cycle follows the same principles as the minor fortune cycle.

### **Principles of the Initial Limit**
This resembles the calculation of the juvenile limit in astrology:
One is life, two is wealth, three is illness and misfortune,
Four is wife, five is fortune—proceed forward in sequence.
At six years, return to the official salary palace,
And count backward until reaching the Life Palace.
For example, if the Life Palace is in *Zǐ*, then:
At one year old, the limit is in the same palace, with the host star as metal;
At two years old, it moves to the Wealth Palace, in *Sì*, with the host star as water;
At four years old, it moves to the Wife Palace, in *Wǔ*, with the host star as the sun;
At five years old, it moves to the Fortune Palace, in *Yín*, with the host star as wood;
At six years old, it moves to the Official Salary Palace, in *Mǎo*, with the host star as fire;
At seven years old, it returns to the Fortune Palace;
At eight years old, it reaches the Appearance Palace, in *Chǒu*, with the host star as earth;
At nine years old, it returns to the Life Palace.
After nine years, the great limit begins. For those whose Life Palace is in other palaces, the same principles apply.

### **Principles of the Great Limit**
In determining the great limit, first exclude the initial nine years, then begin the calculation from the degree’s ruling star in the Life Palace.
Each palace spans thirty degrees, with three degrees governing one year. After passing the degrees, exclude them, and begin the calculation from the remaining degrees, always proceeding forward from right to left—this is explained starting from the limit’s origin in the Life Palace.

The remaining palaces are traversed at a rate of one palace per ten years. For example, if the Life Palace is established at *Zǐ* in the eleventh degree of *Wēi*, the great limit begins at ten years old. If it is in the ninth degree of *Wēi*, the great limit begins at nine years old. If in the sixth degree, it begins at eight years old; if in the third degree, at seven years old. The same principle applies to other cases. If the Life Palace is established at *Zǐ* in the second degree of *Nǚ*, the entire palace is exhausted after the initial nine years, leaving no remaining degrees, so the great limit immediately enters *Chǒu* after the initial nine years.

### **Principles of the Minor Limit**
In determining the minor limit, calculations always begin from the current year’s *Tàisuì* position. Regardless of whether the year is yang or yin, the progression moves counterclockwise from left to right, with one palace traversed per year. The monthly limit is counted from the current year’s position, beginning in the first month; the daily limit is counted from the month’s position, beginning on the first day; the hourly limit is counted from the day’s position, beginning at *Zǐ* hour. For example, if *Tàisuì* is in *Wèi*, *Wèi* corresponds to one year old, *Wǔ* to two years old, *Sì* to three years old. Proceeding rightward through the palaces, at thirteen years old, it returns to *Wèi*, cycling endlessly with one palace per year. The monthly limit moves one palace per month from the year’s position; the daily limit moves one palace per day from the month’s position; the hourly limit moves one palace per hour from the day’s position.

### **Principles of the Three Directions**
*Shēn-Zǐ-Chén*, *Hài-Mǎo-Wèi*, *Sì-Yǒu*, *Chǒu-Yín-Wǔ-Xū*, *Gèn-Bǐng-Xīn*, *Qián-Jiǎ-Dīng*, *Xùn-Gēng-Guǐ*, and *Kūn-Yǐ-Rén*—these are all groupings of the Three Directions.

### **Principles of the Four Cardinal Points**
*Zǐ-Wǔ*, *Mǎo-Yǒu*, *Yín-Shēn*, *Sì-Hài*, *Chén-Xū*, *Chǒu-Wèi*, *Qián-Kūn*, *Gèn-Xùn*, *Jiǎ-Gēng*, *Bǐng-Rén*, *Yǐ-Xīn*, and *Dīng-Guǐ*—these are all groupings of the Four Cardinal Points.

### **Principles of Intercalary Palaces**
*Rén* and *Guǐ* flank *Zǐ*; *Zǐ* and *Chǒu* flank *Guǐ*; *Guǐ* and *Gèn* flank *Chǒu*; *Chǒu* and *Yín* flank *Gèn*; *Gèn* and *Jiǎ* flank *Yín*; *Yín* and *Mǎo* flank *Jiǎ*; *Jiǎ* and *Yǐ* flank *Mǎo*; *Mǎo* and *Chén* flank *Yǐ*; *Yǐ* and *Xùn* flank *Chén*; *Chén* and *Bǐng* flank *Xùn*; *Xùn* and *Wǔ* flank *Bǐng*; *Bǐng* and *Dīng* flank *Wǔ*; *Wǔ* and *Wèi* flank *Dīng*; *Dīng* and *Kūn* flank *Wèi*; *Wèi* and *Gēng* flank *Kūn*; *Kūn* and *Gēng* flank *Shēn*; *Shēn* and *Yǒu* flank *Gēng*; *Gēng* and *Xīn* flank *Yǒu*; *Yǒu* and *Xū* flank *Xīn*; *Xīn* and *Qián* flank *Xū*; *Xū* and *Hài* flank *Qián*; *Qián* and *Zǐ* flank *Rén*.

Additionally, *Hài* and *Chǒu* flank *Zǐ*; *Zǐ* and *Yín* flank *Chǒu*; *Chǒu* and *Mǎo* flank *Yín*; *Yín* and *Chén* flank *Mǎo*; *Mǎo* and *Sì* flank *Chén*; *Chén* and *Wǔ* flank *Sì*; *Sì* and *Wèi* flank *Wǔ*; *Wǔ* and *Shēn* flank *Wèi*; *Wèi* and *Yǒu* flank *Shēn*; *Shēn* and *Xū* flank *Yǒu*; *Yǒu* and *Hài* flank *Xū*; *Xū* and *Zǐ* flank *Hài*.

Also, *Rén* and *Gèn* flank *Guǐ*; *Guǐ* and *Jiǎ* flank *Gèn*; *Gèn* and *Yǐ* flank *Jiǎ*; *Jiǎ* and *Xùn* flank *Yǐ*; *Yǐ* and *Bǐng* flank *Xùn*; *Xùn* and *Dīng* flank *Bǐng*; *Dīng* and *Kūn* flank *Dīng*; *Kūn* and *Gēng* flank *Dīng*; *Kūn* and *Xīn* flank *Gēng*; *Gēng* and *Qián* flank *Xīn*; *Xīn* and *Rén* flank *Qián*.

### **Principles of the Talisman Head**
Each solar term is divided into three throats, with each throat spanning five days. *Jiǎ* and *Jǐ* serve as the talisman heads. When the talisman head aligns with *Zǐ-Wǔ* or *Mǎo-Yǒu*, it marks the upper throat; when it aligns with *Yín-Shēn* or *Sì-Hài*, it marks the middle throat; when it aligns with *Chén-Xū* or *Chǒu-Wèi*, it marks the lower throat. Whenever the talisman head of the upper throat arrives at a day or hour, it signifies the onset of the solar term. For instance, if the day of *Lìchūn* coincides with the upper throat talisman head, that day is regarded as the *qì* throat of *Lìchūn*. If the upper throat talisman head precedes *Lìchūn*, the preceding day is regarded as the *qì* throat. If the upper throat talisman head follows *Lìchūn*, one must wait until the talisman head arrives to mark the *qì* throat of spring—this is the method of "transcending the spirit and connecting the *qì*."

### **Principles of Day and Night Stars**
From *Mǎo* to *Yǒu* is daytime, during which the degree of the Life Palace serves as the primary reference, favoring the visibility of the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn. From *Yǒu* to *Mǎo* is nighttime, during which the degree of the Body Palace serves as the primary reference, favoring the visibility of the Moon, Mars, and Venus. The Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn are all yang in nature, suitable for daytime but not for nighttime. The Moon, Mars, and Venus are all yin in nature, suitable for nighttime but not for daytime. Mercury, though yang in nature, is variable in its effects, sometimes benefiting daytime and sometimes nighttime.

### **Names of the Earthly Branches**
*Zǐ* is called *Xuányáng*, also known as the *Treasure Vessel*; *Hài* is called *Jūzī*, also known as the *Twin Fish*; *Xū* is called *Jiànglóu*, also known as the *White Sheep*; *Yǒu* is called *Dàliáng*, also known as the *Golden Ox*; *Shēn* is called *Shíchén*, also known as the *Yin-Yang*; *Wèi* is called *Chúnshǒu*, also known as the *Great Crab*; *Wǔ* is called *Chúnhuǒ*, also known as the *Lion*; *Sì* is called *Chúnwěi*, also known as the *Twin Maidens*; *Chén* is called *Shòuxīng*, also known as the *Celestial Balance*; *Mǎo* is called *Dàhuǒ*, also known as the *Celestial Scorpion*; *Yín* is called *Xīmù*, also known as the *Archer*; *Chǒu* is called *Xīngjì*, also known as the *Capricorn*.

### **Principles of the Heavenly Palaces**
Though the twelve Earthly Branches vary in width and length, the twelve Heavenly Stems are generally positioned between the Earthly Branches, with each side spanning seven and a half degrees, totaling fifteen degrees. For example, *Guǐ* lies between *Zǐ* and *Chǒu*, with seven and a half degrees allocated to *Chǒu* on the left and seven and a half degrees to *Zǐ* on the right, totaling fifteen degrees. *Rén* lies between *Hài* and *Zǐ*, with seven and a half degrees allocated to *Zǐ* on the left and seven and a half degrees to *Hài* on the right, also totaling fifteen degrees. *Zǐ* itself is divided equally on both sides, retaining only fifteen degrees. The same principle applies to the rest. Modern practitioners often incorrectly assign *Guǐ* to *Zǐ*, *Rén* to *Zǐ*, or *Rén* to *Hài*, or divide them into three and seven parts. Such methods are imbalanced and unreliable. Only the official timekeeping standards of today, which position the Heavenly Stems between the Earthly Branches, represent the correct and immutable method. The division of degrees in the Heavenly Palaces should follow this model.

### **Principles of the Sun and Moon’s Conjunctions**
In the first month, the conjunction occurs in *Hài*; in the second month, in *Xū*; in the third month, in *Yǒu*; in the fourth month, in *Shēn*; in the fifth month, in *Wèi*; in the sixth month, in *Wǔ*; in the seventh month, in *Wèi* again; in the eighth month, in *Chén*; in the ninth month, in *Mǎo*; in the tenth month, in *Yín*; in the eleventh month, in *Chǒu*; and in the twelfth month, in *Zǐ*.

To determine the moment of conjunction, one may infer it from the official calendar’s recorded time of the full moon; this is the method of establishing the *ding shuo* (exact new moon). **Principles of Day and Night Length**
At the Summer Solstice, the day is at its longest, comprising sixty *ke*; the night is at its shortest, comprising only forty *ke*. From the day following the Summer Solstice, gradual adjustments of addition and subtraction begin, roughly at a rate of one *ke* every nine days—daylight gradually decreasing by one *ke*, night gradually increasing by one *ke*. These adjustments continue until the day following the Winter Solstice, when the day is at its shortest, comprising only forty *ke*. For years governed by *Yín*, *Wǔ*, and *Xū*, observe the *Wǔ* (South) direction; for years governed by *Sì*, *Yǒu*, and *Chǒu*, observe the *Yǒu* (West) direction.

**Principles of Opposition**
This refers to the Heavenly Stems being overcome by the Earthly Branches in mutual opposition. For example:
- A person born in *Jiǎ-Zǐ* should avoid *Gēng-Wǔ*;
- A person born in *Gēng-Wǔ* should avoid *Bǐng-Zǐ*;
- A person born in *Yǐ-Chǒu* should avoid *Xīn-Wèi*;
- A person born in *Xīn-Wèi* should avoid *Dīng-Chǒu*;
- A person born in *Bǐng-Yín* should avoid *Rén-Shēn*;
- A person born in *Rén-Shēn* should avoid *Wù-Yín*, and so forth.

However, within these oppositions, there are varying degrees of severity. For instance, if a person born in *Zǐ* encounters *Wǔ*, the opposition is external, and the misfortune will be mild. If a person born in *Wǔ* encounters *Zǐ*, the opposition is internal, and the misfortune will be severe. If the Branch opposes but the Stem is not overcome, or if the Stem is overcome but the Branch does not oppose, these cases do not fall under this principle.

**Thirty-Four Essential Observations in Astrology**
1. In the method of observing the stars, first distinguish the Sun and the Moon. From the moment the Sun first appears, count to the time in question to determine the degree of the life palace. From the moment the Moon first appears, count to the time in question to determine the degree of the body palace. The degree ruler is of primary importance, while the palace ruler is secondary. The palace ruler is like a prefect, while the degree ruler is like a county magistrate—closer to the people and thus more immediate in influence. The palace ruler must encounter favorable conditions: it should be in a phase of growth, not subjected to overcoming or restraint, not obscured by the Sun, and free from stars in the three adjacent and four cardinal directions that would overcome it. Then, observe the degree ruler: it should occupy a strong position, be in the phase of *lù* (emolument), *mǎ* (horse), *chángshēng* (long life), or *suìjià* (annual chariot). It should also be in a phase of prosperity and timely, only then can it be considered excellent.

2. Once the life palace and body palace are established, further determine whether it is day or night. During the day, it is auspicious to observe the degree ruler and palace ruler of the life palace when they encounter the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, or *jì* (calamity) as the *yòngshén* (useful spirit). Encountering the Moon, Mars, Venus, *bó* (comet), or *Luó* (Rāhu) is inauspicious. At night, it is auspicious to observe the degree ruler and palace ruler of the body palace when they encounter the Moon, Mars, Venus, *bó*, or *Luó* as the *yòngshén*. Encountering the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, or *jì* is inauspicious.

3. In constructing a life chart, the Fortune and Virtue Palace must be examined first, for in human life, fortune and virtue are paramount. With good fortune, one may have a spouse and children, establish a reputation, and attain wealth and nobility. If the Fortune and Virtue Palace is deficient, the aforementioned benefits cannot be expected. The Fortune and Virtue Palace is the master of one’s life chart. If fortune resides in *lù*, *lù* resides in fortune, the body ruler commands life, and the life ruler enters fortune; if the Sun and Moon illuminate the Fortune and Virtue Palace, or if stars of power and nobility shine upon it, or if Venus and Mercury flank the ruler within the Fortune and Virtue Palace—such individuals are born with good fortune, their nature upright and magnanimous, blessed with both fortune and longevity. If Saturn or *jì* occupy the Fortune and Virtue Palace, one may still accumulate fortune later in life. However, if the Fortune and Virtue Palace is afflicted by stars of punishment, imprisonment, or depletion, one must not proceed. If mistakenly pursued, it will invite misfortune, and the individual will likely be harsh, treacherous, deceitful, quarrelsome, violent, disloyal, and unfilial. If the Fortune and Virtue Palace lacks favorable stars, observe the stars guarding or illuminating the three adjacent and opposite palaces. If no stars guard or illuminate these, one cannot immediately judge auspiciousness or inauspiciousness; instead, further examine the Wealth Palace.

4. The Wealth Palace is also a crucial aspect of human enjoyment. If the Fortune and Virtue Palace guards the Wealth Palace, or if the Sun and Moon illuminate the Wealth Palace, the Fields and Residences Palace, and the mutual enclosure, or if the body and life rulers reside in the Wealth Palace, and they encounter growth, prosperity, and timeliness, the individual will be born with emolument. Such a person, possessing wealth, can support a spouse and children, acquire servants, and attain both wealth and reputation. If the Wealth ruler is afflicted by punishment, imprisonment, or inauspicious stars, the individual will suffer depletion of wealth and grain, and will be foolish and useless. If the Wealth Palace is unfavorable, one cannot immediately judge auspiciousness or inauspiciousness; instead, further examine the Fields and Residences Palace.

5. The Fields and Residences Palace is also a source of human enjoyment. If the Fields and Residences ruler is not weak, or if the Fortune and Virtue Palace guards the Fields and Residences Palace, or if the Sun and Moon illuminate it, or if the body and life rulers reside in it, the individual will be born with wealth and reputation. With fields and residences, a spouse and children will naturally follow. If the Fortune and Virtue, Fields and Residences, and Wealth Palaces all lack auspicious stars, one must not proceed and should instead select another auspicious time to ensure good fortune.

6. Observe the progression of the life limit in the constructed chart. Even if a person’s life and body are auspicious, if the life limit is unfavorable, they will not prosper. A favorable life limit is more important than a favorable life chart. Only when both the life chart and life limit are auspicious can the time be considered truly auspicious. The life chart is like the soul, the body like the corporeal form, and the life limit like the *qi* and blood—all three must support one another. For example, in the human body, if the *qi* and blood are slightly obstructed, they will not flow smoothly, leading to alternating chills and fever, sores and toxins, and vulnerability to wind and pathogenic *qi*. If the *qi* and blood are harmonious and unobstructed, the body will be robust and free from illness.

7. The life limit must move toward brightness and not away from it to be auspicious. What is meant by "moving toward brightness"? At night, encountering Mars, Venus, or the Moon during the limit is considered moving toward brightness, and prosperity can be expected. During the day, encountering the Sun, Jupiter, or Saturn during the limit is also considered moving toward brightness. If the Sun is not visible, or if Jupiter and Saturn appear alone, or if Mars, the Moon, or Venus illuminate the limit, or if the limit traverses the *shā* (killing), *jié* (robbery), *yángrèn* (yang blade), *sān shā* (three killings), or *kōngwáng* (void), the individual will not prosper.

Every major and minor limit must be assessed based on the day following its inception: the *shén* (spirits), *shā* (killings), *lù* (emoluments), and *guì* (nobility) are examined. From the day after the Winter Solstice, the degrees of the life palace are traversed. Before the age of nine, the minor limit applies; at ten years old, the native’s original degree begins to progress.

In constructing a destiny, the seasonal *lìng* (commanding force) must be carefully observed. For instance, wood in spring, fire in summer, metal in autumn, and water in winter—earth, being lodged in the four seasons, also commands. The *lìng* is like a minister receiving the sovereign’s decree, proclaiming true teachings and transforming the people, upon whom their weal or woe depends. When the *lìng* presides, it must not oppose the decree; otherwise, its authority shines forth, and all gaze upon it in reverence.

When wood commands at the onset of spring, all things sprout and flourish in the season, and people likewise appear fresh and radiant. However, since wood governs the command, metal must not overcome it—metal, as the star of the season and month, should conceal its blade. Earth, then, nurtures wood. Yet if metal and earth intermingle chaotically, it is deemed rebellion and usurpation, inviting calamity. Such a configuration foretells misfortune.

In summer, when fire blazes across the sky, even if water overflows, it dare not encroach upon the fire’s monthly command. Metal, rendered impotent, cannot withstand the scorching heat—what use is it? It must be discarded. Thus, metal often traverses the southern direction in summer. If metal and fire dominate the day’s affairs, they give rise to dissolute, wine-and-women-loving individuals.

Generally, when a star that should be discarded governs the day, those born under its influence will harbor grand ambitions but lack sound strategies, their plans hollow and unrealized. Though they may appear content in life, they are easily set back. The greatest danger lies in metal and water uniting to contend with fire, forming a rebellious configuration. If such stars govern the day, misfortune and ruin are certain.

When metal commands in autumn, the great fire flows westward, abandoned by nature, and all trees wither and fall. Though it is a time when metal alone should govern, if it rebels, disaster follows. If wood and fire combine, they defy the command and grow unruly—how can this not bring misfortune?

In winter, when water is frozen and dark, it relies on fire to warm and assist its flow. Earth, as the star of embankments, poses no harm to the governing force. Yet water and wood share no principle of mutual generation; their union brings only freezing stagnation. If the water star appears at night and governs the day’s affairs, it gives rise to solitary, impoverished individuals.

Generally, when the commanding star rules in spring, it must rely on earth for cultivation. In winter, fire and earth naturally nurture one another, and even water may moisten them. Though a star may be discarded and out of season, it ultimately serves as an outer or inner counterpart. Only the fire star and the metal star of the month must never meet—if they do, harmony is impossible, and disaster strikes.

When the commanding star follows the yang, it is auspicious, serving as a supportive and harmonious star. If it rebels, it becomes inauspicious, a star of arrogance and recklessness. Thus, "following" means either drawing near the yang or aligning with it, even if ten degrees apart, without being overcome. "Rebelling" means encroaching upon the yang’s domain. The commanding star must act in accord with the Sun’s governance, occupying a position of vitality, and not opposing the life ruler. Only then does the command truly emanate from itself. If even slightly overcome, it becomes subject to another’s decree.

When the commanding star seizes control, death is certain; when it governs blessings, fortune follows. The five stars invading the palace or harming the lodges are those that overcome. Scholars must examine this carefully and not be negligent.

The Grand Year Star (*Tàisuì*) is of utmost importance. In constructing a destiny, auspicious stars must be positioned to oversee it, aligning with the Grand Year Star—only then can wealth and nobility be assured. If the Year Lord does not accept the configuration, it is of no use. One must also avoid inauspicious stars breaking the alignment.

In all matters, the body, life, and virtue are paramount. With emolument but no fortune, how can one enjoy blessings? With life but no body, to what can life be tethered?

Inauspicious stars (*shā*) should not align with their season but rather lose it—for example, metal in spring or water in winter. When inauspicious stars lose their season, the ruling star retains its vitality.

Fire as a killing star is unfavorable by day, earth by night. Wood as a killing star must be guarded against in spring, metal in autumn, water in winter, and fire in summer—these are the subtleties of seasonal alignment and misalignment.

If Venus resides in the Sun’s palace, it is called *yìngjìn* (reflected advancement). If the life ruler is positioned before the Sun’s path, it is called *tèjìn* (special advancement), also known as *jīnxīng yìngrì* (Venus reflecting the Sun). When Venus is in power, it signifies authority and nobility. Before the Sun’s path, only the body’s degree is favored. If the life ruler’s degree or Venus precedes it, both are considered noble. However, if before the Sun’s path lies punishment, imprisonment, or hidden depletion, it is called *wùjìn* (erroneous advancement), all inauspicious. If the life ruler or Venus follows the Sun’s path, it is called *hòujìn* (delayed advancement), and its fortune is halved.

When multiple stars move together, some lead and others follow. Generally, inauspicious stars should precede, while ruling stars should arrive later. For example, if water and fire stars move together, water can overcome fire, making water the inauspicious star. If water precedes fire, it cannot overcome it. But if fire precedes and water follows, the inauspicious star presses close to the body, causing great harm—this must be carefully examined. The same applies to all stars.

The *Classic* states: "If the inauspicious star precedes and the ruling star follows, one will wield the power of a vassal or minister. If the inauspicious star follows and the ruling star precedes, one will suffer exile or imprisonment."

When stars retrograde, some do so with power, others without. For instance, if fire and metal stars move together and metal precedes while fire follows in retrograde, the inauspicious star dares not advance to overcome metal—this is "retrograde with affection." But if metal retrogrades and encounters fire moving forward, it is "retrograde meeting its inauspicious star." This applies to all five luminaries.

There are also cases where retrograde motion leads to ascending the palace, entering the enclosure, or encountering generation—all auspicious. Conversely, retrograding into a killing star, meeting an inauspicious star, or entering a weak and malevolent palace—all are inauspicious.

Here follows the translation:

---

Among the five stars, the phenomena of *delay*, *station*, *occultation*, and *retrogradation* are of critical importance—scholars must not fail to understand them clearly.

*Delay* means falling behind the proper degree; *station* means halting in motion; *occultation* means becoming invisible; *retrogradation* means moving backward. When a star of beneficial influence moves forward in direct motion, it brings fortune. But when it is *delayed*, *stationary*, *occulted*, or *retrograde*, its power wanes in both advance and retreat.

As the *Classic* states: “In direct motion, one moves with ease; in retrogradation, one shrinks back. When stationary, one is bound and depressed; when occulted, one conceals brilliance and loses radiance.”

For example, if the Life Star is in the *wu* position of the Sun, it is inauspicious when wood-qi occupies the same celestial path. If wood precedes and the Sun follows in retrogradation, misfortune arises; if the Sun precedes and wood follows in retrogradation, fortune ensues.

When a star of beneficial influence is *stationary* in a substantial position, its fortune endures. But if an inauspicious star is *stationary* in a substantial position, its misfortune persists without cease. If *stationary* in an insubstantial position, neither fortune nor misfortune arises.

When a star of beneficial influence is *occulted*, its power weakens; when an inauspicious star is *occulted*, no disaster occurs.

*Retrogradation* is backward motion. Some retrogradations bring fortune, others misfortune—this must be determined by reasoned analysis.

As the *Verse* says:
> When the five stars meet the Sun, they must occult;
> When three meet in yang, they surely station.
> If in opposition they form retrograde motion,
> Where yang is absent, there is delay.

The *Luoji* and *Jidu* stars sever the celestial dome, bringing both fortune and misfortune. If they sever stars to the left while the life limit moves to the right, this is called “turning away.” Since the life limit does not encounter the stars, outcomes vary in ascent and descent.

If during the day the stars occupy the sky and the severance occurs in the *chen-si-wu-wei-shen* positions with stars present, while the life limit moves through the *you-xu-hai-zi-chou-yin* positions without stars, this is called “failing to attain embodiment.” Similarly, if at night the severance occurs in the *xu-hai-zi-chou-yin* positions with stars present, while the life limit moves through the *chen-si-wu-wei-shen* positions without stars, these too reflect differing ascents and descents and do not conform to proper patterns.

When the *Luoji* and *Jidu* sever the celestial dome, if one star leaps beyond the Dipper, its fortune or misfortune must be assessed independently. If the leaping star is a fortune lord, emolument lord, life lord, body lord, or a star of official rank, authority, or nobility—such as night fire, night moon, day wood, or day earth—this is considered a proper pattern, and the native will surely attain wealth, honor, and success.

But if the leaping star is one of punishment, imprisonment, or hidden depletion, or a star of servitude, the *yangren*, *jiesha*, or *dishe*, or day fire, day metal, or night earth, and it escapes outward, these do not conform to proper patterns. Such natives will surely endure poverty, toil, and hardship, passing through life without achievement, and cannot be deemed fortunate.

The severance must not allow the Sun to leap outward. If the Sun is isolated externally, this is called “the solitary ruler.” A ruler in solitary retreat without assistance is extremely inauspicious. Since the Sun symbolizes the sovereign, it must be accompanied by assisting stars, preferably with auspicious stars to its left and right. If the Sun stands alone, even close attendants will distance themselves, and the native will surely suffer hardship.

When stars gather in conjunction, some gatherings are auspicious, others inauspicious. Auspicious gatherings involve the life lord, body lord, palace lord, official rank, fortune, or emolument, or transformations into authority, nobility, or protective seals—all are auspicious. Even if the gathering includes fire, *Luoji*, *Jidu*, or *Beidou*, no harm arises.

But if the gathering does not involve the aforementioned stars and instead includes the *dishe*, *jiesha*, *yangren*, or other malevolent stars, or transforms into punishment, imprisonment, or hidden depletion, it is inauspicious. Scholars must not fail to discern this.

When the life or body lord occupies the position of servants, outcomes may be either auspicious or inauspicious. In the charts of noble persons, the life or body lord often enters the servant position and still attains nobility, though some enter it and remain base.

If the servant palace originally occupies a position of nobility, emolument, *changsheng*, *diwang*, rank, merit, authority, or emolument, the native will surely attain wealth, honor, and success. But if the servant palace originally occupies a position of *jiesha*, *dishe*, *yangren*, *sijue*, or *baobai*, and the life or body lord resides there, the native will surely be one who toils without achievement. Scholars must examine this with great care.

In constructing a life chart, the four cardinal positions are of paramount importance. If the Sun and Moon illuminate the four cardinals, or if metal and wood illuminate them, or if fortune and virtue illuminate them, or if the star of beneficial influence occupies the four cardinal positions, the native will surely attain wealth and honor. Even if fire, *Luoji*, *Jidu*, or *Beidou* guard the four strong positions and transform favorably, this is also considered proper.

But if stars of punishment, imprisonment, or hidden depletion occupy the four cardinal palaces and encounter clashing stars, the native will surely suffer ruin and defeat.

In examining the stars, one follows the same method as in life analysis: consider both the three harmonies and direct illumination to determine fortune or misfortune. Generally, in assessing the three harmonies and four auxiliaries, the five stars are given less weight than direct illumination. The four auxiliaries are emphasized over the five stars, for the four auxiliaries are stars of sudden, disruptive force.

When the ten celestial stems govern life, as in a *jia* year, one must not establish life in the degree of a metal constellation—this is called “ghostly clash” and brings misfortune. It is auspicious only to sit on a star of generation in a water constellation—this is called “upon the parents.” Sitting on an earth constellation is called “upon wealth and silk.” Sitting on a fire constellation is called “upon release from entanglement.” One must intuitively grasp the waxing and waning of influence; being timely and in accord with the season is most excellent. The rest follow this principle.

When life or body sits on emolument, nobility, *changsheng*, the storehouse, the chariot, the palace, the encircling noble nest, the pivot of emolument and horses, or the palaces of *sheng* and *wang*, the native will surely attain wealth and honor. Even if not fully so, they will still enjoy ample clothing and food.

As the *Tianxuan Fu* states:
> When emolument, horses, and noble persons hold the world and establish the body,
> One must attain purity and high rank.
> When inauspicious stars and killers approach the body,
> One’s conduct will surely be base and lowly.

When life or body sits on *jieshe*, *yangren*, *baobai*, emptiness, *sijue*, the three killers, or the *Feilian* killer, the native will surely be treacherous, eccentric, unfilial, unrighteous, violent, and toilsome.

When life or body is flanked by the Sun and Moon, by *fude* (fortune and virtue), by *guankui* (official prominence), by *yingui* (seal and nobility), or by the three harmonies converging upon them, all are auspicious. Even if the life ruler or body ruler arises in another location yet still flanks and converges upon them, all remain auspicious.

When the palace of *jieshe* (robbery) or *mangren* (blades) is flanked by inauspicious stars, their baleful consequences are beyond description. Yet without *guanfu* (official talismans), blades cannot form; without *suipo* (annual destruction), robbery cannot arise; without *bingfu* (illness talismans), sickness and misfortune cannot take shape—such is the true generation and destruction of the five phases.

The palace of official emolument must not be afflicted by star clashes; such a palace is called *guangui* (official ghost). For instance, if official emolument resides in the *yin* (Tiger) position, one must not allow the Metal star to enter it, nor should the three harmonies or four cardinal palaces occupy it—all such configurations portend litigation, official entanglements, or the absence of emolument.

The palaces of official emolument and *fude* (fortune and virtue) most require the presence of auspicious stars. If the Sun and Moon reside in the palace of official emolument or *fude*, or if *fulu* (fortune and emolument) resides in the palaces of office or fortune, or if Water, Sun, Metal, or Moon each occupy the palace of official emolument, and the moving limit encounters them, all portend the flourishing of fortune. If the palaces of office and fortune lack stars but are activated by auspicious luminaries suspended above them, this too is auspicious. One must also examine the opposing and triply harmonizing palaces to determine fortune or misfortune.

In constructing a destiny, one need only seek the ruling star, the life degree, the life ruler, the body degree, and the body ruler, assessing their strength, weakness, fortune, and misfortune—there is no need for every star to be exalted or in its proper place. Thus the *Classic* states: "If one star is well-placed, one will be noble and auspicious throughout life." It also says: "If one star is adverse and its faults are not examined, even if all other luminaries are auspicious, they cannot bring fortune." For example, among five or seven officials in office, not every one need be competent; if but one is capable, all underlings in the prefectures and counties will regard him with respect.

In observing the stars, one must first apply reason, then examine the limit ruler and the moving limit. The limit ruler must be exalted, well-placed, and receiving the convergence of life-giving auspicious stars to constitute a good limit and bring success. Otherwise, all are inauspicious.

In discussing the five stars, one must investigate the celestial lodgings of the Sun and Moon to determine fortune and misfortune, wealth and poverty, nobility and baseness—nine out of ten will be accurate. For the life palace, the Sun is the ruler; for the body palace, the Moon is the ruler. When the root is upright, what foundation is lacking? Thus, by day one must examine the Sun, and by night the Moon. If by day the Sun encounters baleful stars, or by night the Moon encounters inauspicious stars, the native will surely suffer poverty, lowliness, and early death. If by day auspicious constellations meet the Sun, or by night the stars hook the Moon, the native will surely enjoy wealth, nobility, and prominence. Yet one must still consider whether they are within their proper degrees or not.

If all stars are gentle and yielding, they cannot accomplish great deeds; one must have a baleful star to augment their authority. Generally, if auspicious stars are many and baleful stars few, one judges by the auspicious. If baleful stars are many and auspicious stars few, one judges by the baleful. In the destiny of a noble person, without the power of baleful stars, they cannot govern the world.

In all destinies, the Sun and Moon must be bright and pure to be considered auspicious. Heaven and Earth take the Sun and Moon as their rulers; only when the Sun and Moon are bright can one attain nobility and prominence. The *Classic* states: "For a noble person, the Sun and Moon must be distinct; if the Sun and Moon are not bright, they are not noble."

While the original guarding star may be good, one must still fear the harm of stars in the flowing years. If the limit ruler is both baleful and weak, and the flowing year’s baleful stars are heavy, they too can bring disaster—this must not be overlooked. If the limit ruler is strong, and only the flowing year brings misfortune, one must wait until the baleful stars depart before improvement comes. Thus the *Classic* states: "Though the original guard may be blameless, one still fears calamity in the flowing year; though the original guard may be pure, it surpasses the savor of fine food, while the flowing year’s misfortune is like rootless floodwaters." Therefore, those who wish to make good choices must ensure that the original guarding star was once auspicious and the limit ruler is not debilitated or weak before employing them.

*Rumen Chongli Zhezhong Kanyu Wanxiao Lu*, Scroll Four: *Seven Governors* (Excerpt)

The *Seven Governors* refer to the Sun, the Moon, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, and Mercury. All auspicious or inauspicious orientations in mountain geomancy derive from these. The method requires first examining the flow of celestial qi to discern the waxing and waning of its transformations; next, observing the heavens to distinguish the stars; and then inspecting the earth to differentiate the terrestrial correspondences. Thus, one may pursue the auspicious and avoid the inauspicious—this is the essential mechanism of divination. A detailed exposition follows.

**Application of the Seven Governors**
The Sun is the essence of fire and the most auspicious spirit; it bestows blessings, not misfortune, except during solar eclipses, when it is highly inauspicious.

The Moon is the essence of water, secondary to the Sun; it also bestows blessings, not misfortune, except during lunar eclipses, when it is inauspicious.

Jupiter, called the Year Star, exerts urgent influence over fortune and misfortune in winter and spring, but its effects are delayed in summer and autumn.

Mars, called the Sparkling Deluder, exerts urgent influence in spring and summer, but its effects are delayed in autumn and winter.

Saturn, called the Quelling Star, exerts urgent influence during the four seasons, but its effects are delayed in spring and autumn.

Venus, called the Great White, exerts urgent influence in the final months of the seasons and in autumn, but its effects are delayed in summer and winter.

Mercury, called the Chronographic Star, exerts urgent influence in autumn and winter, but its effects are delayed in spring and summer.

Qi is the surplus of wood, its fortune and misfortune secondary to Jupiter.

Comets are the surplus of water, their fortune and misfortune secondary to Mercury.

Rahu is the surplus of fire, its fortune and misfortune secondary to Mars.

Ketu is the surplus of earth, its fortune and misfortune secondary to Saturn.

The lunar lodges *Xing*, *Xu*, *Fang*, and *Mao* are the palaces traversed by the Sun.

The lodges *Zhang*, *Wei*, *Xin*, and *Bi* are the palaces traversed by the Moon.

The lodges *Jiao*, *Dou*, *Kui*, and *Jing* are the palaces traversed by Jupiter.

The lodges *Wei*, *Shi*, *Zi*, and *Yi* are the palaces traversed by Mars.

The lodges *Shi*, *Nü*, *Wei*, and *Liu* are the palaces traversed by Saturn.

The lodges *Kang*, *Niu*, *Lou*, and *Gui* are the palaces traversed by Venus.

The lodges *Ji*, *Bi*, *Shen*, and *Wo* are the palaces traversed by Mercury.

These are the degrees through which the Seven Governors move. Encountering generative or supportive influences brings auspiciousness; encountering destructive or draining influences brings misfortune.

**Diagram of Yin-Yang and the Five Phases**
This is the fixed structure of yin-yang and the Five Phases, derived from the numbers of the *River Chart*, all based on the earthly branches. The twelve celestial stems occupy their positions but do not govern their qi exclusively; one must calculate from right to left.

**Diagram of the Fixed Human Element**
The celestial stems are called the Heavenly Element, the earthly branches the Earthly Element. What is concealed within the branches is called the Human Element—indispensable for those engaged in fate calculation and divination. The details are illustrated in the following verse:

Within the *Zi* palace, *Gui* water resides;
*Zi* and *Chou* share *Gui*, *Xin* metal, and *Ji* earth.
The *Yin* palace holds *Jia* wood, *Bing* fire, and *Wu* earth;
The *Mao* palace, *Yi* wood alone, thrives in abundance.
The *Chen* palace divides *Yi* wood, *Wu* earth, and *Gui* water;
The *Si* palace gathers *Ji* earth, *Geng* metal, and *Bing* fire.
The *Wu* palace contains *Ding* fire and *Ji* earth;
The *Wei* palace unites *Yi* wood, *Ji* earth, and *Ding* fire.
The *Shen* palace holds *Ren* water, *Geng* metal, and *Wu* earth;
The *You* palace follows *Xin* metal and *Geng* metal.
Only the *Xu* palace combines *Ding* fire, *Xin* metal, and *Wu* earth;
The *Hai* palace’s true lineage is *Ren* water and *Jia* wood.

**Diagram of the Life and Death of the Five Phases**
*Long Life*, *Bathing*, *Coming of Age*, *Officership*, *Flourishing*, *Decline*, *Illness*, *Death*, *Grave*, *Extinction*, *Embryo*, and *Nurturing*—these follow in sequence. Yang moves forward, yin moves backward; when yang dies, yin must live, and when yin dies, yang must live.

*Embryo* and *Nurturing* are advancing qi; *Coming of Age* and *Officership* are flourishing qi; *Bathing* is waning qi; *Decline* and *Illness* are retreating qi; *Grave* is storing qi; *Death* and *Extinction* are exhausted qi.

Generally, advancing qi does not bring death, nor does retreating qi bring life. Yet there are cases of survival in death and rebirth in extinction—these are matters a fate calculator must not overlook.

**Diagram of the Generation and Conquest of the Five Phases**
This is the *River Chart*: Heaven One generates water, Earth Six completes it; Earth Two generates fire, Heaven Seven completes it; Heaven Three generates wood, Earth Eight completes it; Earth Four generates metal, Heaven Nine completes it; Heaven Five generates earth, Earth Ten completes it. Each generates and conquers—such is the natural nature of the Five Phases. If one engaged in divination understands their generative and conquering nature and practices the Way of regulation and transformation, there will be no excess or deficiency. How could this not suffice to pursue the auspicious and avoid the inauspicious?

**Diagram of the Sun’s Rising and Setting**
Modern astrologers claim the Sun rises in *Mao* and sets in *You*—this is merely an approximation. For precise divination, one must consult this diagram to determine the exact time.

**Diagram of the Moon’s Dawn and Dusk**
Almanacs record that after the new moon, the Moon’s degrees are measured at dusk, and after the full moon, at dawn—this, too, is an approximation. For accurate divination, one must consult this diagram to ensure the timing is correct.

**Diagram of the Stars’ Terrestrial Correspondences**
These are the terrestrial correspondences that align with the celestial stars. Those engaged in divination must not be ignorant of them, nor should those observing celestial qi.

**Diagram of the Transiting Constellations**
This is the fixed arrangement of the Twenty-Eight Lodges and the sequence of the Seven Governors’ movements. Their correspondence to the twelve terrestrial regions must not be overlooked.

**Diagram of the Fixed Positions of the Stars**
Each palace contains slightly more than thirty degrees, totaling 365¼ degrees—the fractional remainders of each palace. When examining the Seven Governors, one assigns them to the twelve palaces according to this diagram, which also serves as the basis for determining the positions of the *Nobleman*, *Salary*, and *Horse*. For example, *Gui*’s salary is in *Zi*; one checks where Saturn resides to find the salary’s origin, and the rest follow accordingly. The Four Surpluses are assessed based on their governing qi.

Three degrees of *Shi* enter *Mao*, three degrees of *Wei* enter *Yin*;
Four degrees of *Dou* are sought within *Chou*;
Two degrees of *Nü* have passed, then *Xu* turns;
Thirteen degrees of *Wei* revolve within *Hai*.

**Diagram of the Degrees of the Celestial Sphere**
*Kui* enters *Xu* by two degrees, *Wei* enters *You* by four;
*Bi* shifts past *Shen* by seven degrees;
*Jing* passes *Wei* by nine, *Liu* enters *Wu* by four;
*Zhang* extends into *Si* by fifteen, *Zhen* reaches *Chen* by ten.

**Diagram of the Enclosures and Configurations of the Stars**
Whenever a *wei*-star resides in the palace of its governing *qi* and occupies the degree of its own *qi*, it is called *dwelling in the enclosure*. When it resides in the palace of its generating *qi* and occupies the degree of its generating *qi*, it is called *entering the configuration*. When it resides in the palace of its own *qi* but occupies the degree of its generating *qi*, it is called *dwelling in the enclosure and entering the configuration*. When it resides in the palace of its generating *qi* but occupies the degree of its own *qi*, it is called *entering the configuration and dwelling in the enclosure*. The fortunes and misfortunes of such stars are of utmost importance, and their activation is equivalent to that of the ruling star.

**Method of Degrees**
The celestial sphere comprises 365¼ degrees. Whenever "a quarter of a degree" is mentioned, it refers to twenty-five *fen*. For one degree equals one hundred *fen*, and one *fen* equals one hundred *miao*. All ancient and modern calendrical methods are calculated accordingly.

**Fixed Configuration of the Celestial Motion by Hour**
Each *ke* advances slightly more than three degrees—precisely three degrees and seventy-six *fen*. Each hour traverses one palace and a fraction, totaling thirty degrees and fifty-one *fen*, thirty-three *miao*, and a fraction. In one day, it completes 365¼ degrees and advances by one additional degree. Compared to the sun’s motion, it exceeds by one degree; compared to the moon’s motion, it exceeds by thirteen degrees. After one year, it completes the full cycle of the celestial sphere, reunites with the sun, and marks the end of the year. Some say the celestial motion completes one revolution in a year, referring only to the degrees it advances.

**Fixed Configuration of the Sun’s Motion by Hour**
Each *ke* advances slightly more than three degrees—precisely three degrees and seventy-five *fen*. Each hour advances one palace, totaling thirty degrees and forty-three *fen*, seventy-five *miao*, and a fraction. In one day, it completes 365¼ degrees, falling short of the celestial motion by nearly one degree and exceeding the moon’s motion by twelve degrees. In one year, it does not complete a full revolution of the celestial sphere. At the winter solstice, it moves through degrees of excess; at the summer solstice, through degrees of deficiency. Though the excess and deficiency differ, calendrical experts generally calculate by subtracting one degree per day.

**Fixed Configuration of the Moon’s Motion by Hour**
Each *ke* advances slightly more than three degrees—precisely three degrees and fifty *fen*. Each hour advances slightly less than one palace, totaling twenty-nine degrees and forty-three *fen*, seventy-five *miao*, and a fraction. In one day, it completes 353¼ degrees, falling short of the sun’s motion by twelve degrees and the celestial motion by thirteen degrees. In twenty-nine days, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere, marking the new moon. Before the quarter moon, its retreat is swift; after the quarter moon, its retreat slows. On average, it retreats by thirteen degrees and thirty-seven *fen* per day.

**Fixed Configuration of Jupiter’s Motion by Hour**
Each hour advances slightly more than one palace, totaling slightly more than thirty degrees, falling short of the celestial motion by slightly more than seventy *miao*. In one day, it completes 365¼ degrees and advances by slightly less than one degree, falling short of the celestial motion by thirty-three *miao* and a fraction. In twelve days, it falls short by one degree; in one hundred twenty days, by ten degrees; in three hundred sixty days, by one palace. In twelve years, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere.

**Fixed Configuration of Mars’ Motion by Hour**
Each hour advances slightly more than one palace, totaling slightly more than thirty degrees, falling short of the celestial motion by four *fen* and slightly less than seventy *miao*. In one day, it completes 365 degrees and advances by slightly less than one degree, falling short of the celestial motion by fifty *fen*. In two days, it falls short by one degree; in sixty days, by one palace. In two years, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere.

**Fixed Configuration of Saturn’s Motion by Hour (Same as the *Qi*-Star)**
Each hour advances slightly more than one palace, totaling slightly more than thirty degrees, falling short of the celestial motion by twenty-nine *miao* and five-tenths of a *miao*. In one day, it completes 365¼ degrees and advances by slightly less than one degree, falling short of the celestial motion by slightly less than three *fen* and fifty-three *miao*. In twenty-eight days, five hours, one *ke*, and six *fen*, it falls short by one degree. In two hundred eighty days and four hours, it falls short by ten degrees and twenty *fen*. In one month and twenty-five days, it falls short by one palace. In twenty-eight years, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere.

**Fixed Configuration of Venus and Mercury’s Motion by Hour**
Each hour advances one palace and a fraction, totaling slightly more than thirty degrees, falling short of the celestial motion by eight *fen* and thirty-three *miao*. In one day, it completes slightly less than 365¼ degrees, falling short of the celestial motion by slightly more than one degree. In one month, it falls short by one palace; in one year, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere.

**Fixed Configuration of the Purple *Qi*’s Motion by Hour**
The configuration of this star’s motion should be inferred from that of Saturn, as it also completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere in twenty-eight years.

**Fixed Configuration of the Moon’s *Bei*’s Motion by Hour**
Each hour advances slightly more than twenty-nine degrees and ninety-nine *fen*, falling short of the celestial motion by slightly less than one *fen*. In one day, it completes 365¼ degrees and advances by eighty-eight *fen*, falling short of the celestial motion by slightly less than twelve *fen*. In nine days, it falls short by one degree; in ninety days, by ten degrees; in nine months, by one palace. In nine years, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere.

**Fixed Configuration of *Luo* and *Ji*’s Motion by Hour**
Each hour moves in retrograde by one palace and nine *fen*, fifty *miao*, and a fraction, falling short of the celestial motion by slightly more than fifty *miao*. In one day, it moves in retrograde by 365¼ degrees and advances by slightly more than ninety-four *fen*.

It falls short of the celestial motion by slightly less than six *fen*. In eighteen days, it falls short by one degree; in one hundred eighty days, by ten degrees; in eighteen months, by one palace. In eighteen years, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere. Calendarists calculate based on its retrograde motion, hence the saying: "*Luo* and *Ji* revolve leftward, while the Seven Luminaries, *qi*, and comets all turn rightward."

In selecting years, months, days, and hours, one must sequentially track the Seven Luminaries, *qi*, and comets while retrogradely tracking the two stars *Luo* and *Ji*. Otherwise, misfortune will surely follow—this cannot be neglected.

**Fixed Configuration of the Imperial Star’s Motion by Hour**
Each hour, it advances by one-twelfth of a degree. In one day, it moves forward by one degree; in one month, by one palace; in one year, it completes a full revolution of the celestial sphere.

The calendar begins at the *Jingzhe* solar term, with the hour at *jia*, moving sequentially toward *mao*. Each node passes one mountain—arriving at the mountain is most auspicious. Whether reaching the orientation, the three directions, or the four cardinal points, if they assist or support me, it is auspicious; if they restrain or drain me, it is inauspicious.

Master Yang said: "Building in spring is auspicious in the east; in summer, in the south; in autumn, in the west; in winter, in the north. During the four seasons, building in the four corners is auspicious—does this not reflect the same principle?" In spring, it is called the Green Emperor; in summer, the Red Emperor; in autumn, the White Emperor; in winter, the Black Emperor. Though their names differ with the seasons, the principle remains one.

**Fixed Configuration of Auspicious and Inauspicious Palaces and Degrees**
The *zi* and *chou* palaces, along with the *Bing*, *Nü*, *Wei*, and *Liu* lodges, are all positions of earth. For those residing above them, wood-*qi* is harmful, water-comets are adversaries, fire-*Luo* is benevolent, and metal is useful—these are the ruling stars in the four seasonal months.

The *yin* and *hai* palaces, along with the *Jiao*, *Dou*, *Kui*, and *Jing* lodges, are all positions of wood. For those residing above them, metal is harmful, earth-*Ji* is an adversary, water-comets are benevolent, and fire-*Luo* is useful—these are the ruling stars in spring.

The *mao* and *xu* palaces, along with the *Wei*, *Shi*, *Zi*, and *Yi* lodges, are all positions of fire. For those residing above them, water-comets are harmful, metal is an adversary, wood-*qi* is benevolent, and earth-*Ji* is useful—these are the ruling stars in summer.

The *chen* and *you* palaces, along with the *Kang*, *Niu*, *Lou*, and *Gui* lodges, are all positions of metal. For those residing above them, fire-*Luo* is harmful, wood-*qi* is an adversary, earth-*Ji* is benevolent, and water-comets are useful—these are the ruling stars in autumn.

The *si* and *shen* palaces, along with the *Ji*, *Bi*, *Shen*, and *Gang* lodges, are all positions of water. For those residing above them, earth-*Ji* is harmful, fire-*Luo* is an adversary, metal is benevolent, and wood-*qi* is useful—these are the ruling stars in winter.

The *wu* palace, along with the *Xing*, *Xu*, *Fang*, and *Xu* lodges, is the position of the Great Yang. For those residing above it, the conjunction of fire-*Luo* and wood is inauspicious; metal and water stars are favored. It is suitable for daytime but not for night, and a solar eclipse is inauspicious.

The *wei* palace, along with the *Zhang*, *Wei*, *Xin*, and *Bi* lodges, is the position of the Great Yin. For those residing above it, the conjunction of earth-*Ji* is inauspicious; metal and water stars are also favored. It is suitable for night but not for day, stronger before the full moon and weaker after. A lunar eclipse is inauspicious.

In the above palace degrees, benevolent and useful stars in their season are auspicious, while adversarial and harmful stars in their season are highly inauspicious. This principle applies not only to each palace but also to major and minor limits—all follow this rule.

**Diagrammatic Explanation**
The twenty-eight lunar lodges are distributed across the twelve palaces, forming the sequence of the Seven Governors’ motion. The seven governors and four remnants move through each year, giving rise to celestial changes. Two diagrams follow for easy reference.

Where the Great Yang resides determines the life palace (*ming*); where the Great Yin resides determines the body palace (*shen*). Once life and body are established, the ruling stars of each palace can be deduced. For example:
- If *ming* is in *zi* and earth is the ruler, wealth is in *hai*;
- If wood is the ruler, siblings are in *xu*;
- If fire is the ruler, property is in *you*;
- If metal is the ruler, children are in *shen*;
- If water is the ruler, servants are in *wei*;
- If the moon is the ruler, the spouse palace is in *wu*;
- If the sun is the ruler, illness is in *si*;
- If water is the ruler, relocation is in *chen*;
- If metal is the ruler, official rank is in *mao*;
- If fire is the ruler, fortune and virtue are in *yin*;
- If wood is the ruler, appearance is in *chou*;
- If earth is the ruler, yearly celestial and terrestrial stars all derive from this.

If scholars can consult the diagrams, they may discern fortune and misfortune, mastering the art of selection.

**Sequence of the Twelve Palaces**
For nighttime hours, count from the body palace (*shen*).
1. Life Palace (*minggong*)
2. Wealth
3. Siblings
4. Property
5. Children
6. Servants
7. Spouse
8. Illness
9. Relocation
10. Official Rank
11. Fortune and Virtue
12. Appearance

**Strengths and Weaknesses of the Twelve Palaces**
Strong palaces: Life, Spouse, Property and Wealth, Official Rank and Fortune, Children.
Weak palaces: Relocation, Illness, Servants, Siblings.
Those aligned with the season are exceptions.

**Life and Body Palaces in the Twelve Palaces**
From *mao* to *you* is daytime, so count from the life palace (*minggong*):
1. Life Palace
2. Wealth
3. Siblings
...and so on, retrograding through the twelve palaces.

From *you* to *mao* is nighttime, so count from the body palace (*shengong*):
1. Body Palace
2. Wealth
3. Siblings
...also retrograding through the twelve palaces.

Even for the seven strong palaces, nighttime uses the body palace, and daytime uses the life palace—this is the correct method. Moreover, the life and body palaces each have their ruling stars and degree rulers, which those who practice selection must not overlook.

Some contemporary practitioners of astrological fate-calculation emphasize only the palace ruler, while others focus solely on the degree ruler—neither is a definitive principle. For true insight, one must recognize when the palace ruler generates or supports the degree ruler, or when the degree ruler generates or supports the palace ruler. In such cases, above and below interact, their *qi* harmonizes, and the outcome is often auspicious. Conversely, if the palace ruler exhausts or clashes with the degree ruler, or the degree ruler exhausts or clashes with the palace ruler, above and below fail to interact, their *qi* obstructed, and the outcome is often inauspicious.

Though this is an established method, exceptions exist: when strong, it is fitting to be restrained or drained; when weak, it is fitting to be generated or supported. This is the Dao of the sage in nurturing and assisting.

For external palaces such as wealth, property, and others, degree rulers also exist, all calculated from the life or body palace’s degree.
- If the life or body palace is in *Wu* (Horse) Palace at *Zhang* 10 degrees, the wealth palace is in *Si* (Snake) Palace.
- At *Zhen* 5 degrees, the siblings palace is in *Chen* (Dragon) Palace.
- At *Kang* 6 degrees, the property palace is in *Mao* (Rabbit) Palace.
- At *Xin* 4 degrees, the children palace is in *Yin* (Tiger) Palace.
- At *Ji* 9 degrees, the servants palace is in *Chou* (Ox) Palace.
- At *Niu* 4 degrees, the spouses palace is in *Zi* (Rat) Palace.
- At *Wei* 8 degrees, the illness palace is in *Hai* (Pig) Palace.
- At *Bi* 6 degrees, the migration palace is in *Xu* (Dog) Palace.
- At *Lou* 11 degrees, the official salary palace is in *You* (Rooster) Palace.
- At *Bi* 2 degrees, the fortune and virtue palace is in *Shen* (Monkey) Palace.
- At *Jing* 4 degrees, the appearance palace is in *Wei* (Sheep) Palace.
- From *Liu* initial degree onward, the pattern continues similarly.

Within the twelve palaces, there are instances where auspiciousness conceals inauspiciousness, or inauspiciousness conceals auspiciousness. For example, the sun, moon, metal, water, and purple *qi* are all auspicious deities, yet they may transform into adversities, punishments, imprisonment, *Yangren*, or *Qisha*—not necessarily auspicious. Fire, *Luo*, *Ji*, and *Bei* are all inauspicious malefics, yet they may transform into beneficence, emolument, nobility, literary brilliance, or fortune stars—not necessarily inauspicious.

When the hours of *Mao* (Rabbit), *Chen* (Dragon), *Si* (Snake), *Wu* (Horse), *Wei* (Sheep), or *Shen* (Monkey) govern, calculations for wealth, siblings, property, children, and servants should begin from the life palace’s degree. Those who calculate palaces without degrees err. When the hours of *You* (Rooster), *Xu* (Dog), *Hai* (Pig), *Zi* (Rat), *Chou* (Ox), or *Yin* (Tiger) govern, calculations for wealth, siblings, property, and other stars should begin from the body palace’s degree. Those who persist in starting from the life palace’s degree err further. These are unresolved doubts among the common folk; scholars should examine them carefully. The remainder is illustrated in the diagrams.

*Celestial Talisman Canon Preface*
*Confucian School’s Reverence for Principle: A Balanced Study of Geomancy and Filial Piety, Scroll Five*

Here begins this work with Rongcheng, appearing in the *Plain Book*, while Master Red Pine expounded it in the *Green Satchel Classic*, and Huang Shigong annotated it in the *Green Satchel Transmission*. By the Song dynasty, Master Chen Chuan further divided and explicated its sections, exhausting their subtleties. He elucidated the mechanisms of the fivefold connections and sixfold qi, revealing the secrets of generation, assistance, restraint, and drainage. Its principles are most comprehensive, its methods most refined. This is because the ancients followed the transformations of creation, and thus their applications achieved such marvels.

Yet these methods prove infallible only when qi and fortune are in ascendance, coinciding with true mountains and waters. The principles of *shu* and *ru* are as follows:

**Diagram of the Fivefold Movements**
This is the River Diagram’s fixed positions. Its celestial revolutions change yearly, with earth at the center to stabilize the four directions. Thus it is said: "The ruler governs while the rest each administer a direction, executing the ruler’s commands—hence, the ministers govern."

*Verse:*
Jia and Ji transform earth, Yi and Geng transform metal,
Bing and Xin bring forth water, raising sweet rains;
Fire emerges in the south, seeking Wu and Gui,
Ding and Ren transform wood, forming boundless forests.

**Diagram of the Sixfold Qi**
This is the Later Heaven’s flowing numbers. Its qi descends to earth, changing every sixty days. After Great Cold, *Jueyin*’s generative qi arises; after the Spring Equinox, *Shaoyin*’s expansive qi; after Grain Full, *Shaoyang*’s growing qi; after Great Heat, *Taiyin*’s central qi; after the Autumn Equinox, *Yangming*’s gathering qi; after Light Snow, *Taiyang*’s storing qi. Each node comprises three pentads, each pentad five days, further divided into seventy-two qi.

*Verse:*
The six qi are distinct, each spanning sixty days,
Great Cold’s wind and water trace their origins;
The sovereign and minister still precede damp earth,
Cold water ever yields to dry metal.

**Diagram of Ruling and Descending Qi**
This depicts yin and yang’s mutual revolutions, changing yearly. *Zi* and *Wu* oppose *Mao* and *You*; *Chou* and *Wei* oppose *Chen* and *Xu*; *Yin* and *Shen* oppose *Si* and *Hai*. Ruling and descending qi alternate in function, embodying yin and yang’s mutual concealment within their domains, while the five qi spread in sequence. All mechanisms of supplementation and drainage must be deduced from this.

*Verse:*
*Zi-Wu*’s sovereign fire and dry metal descend,
*Chou-Wei*’s damp earth and cold water unite,
*Yin-Shen*’s ministerial fire and wind-wood align,
The rest oppose likewise without exception.

**Diagram of Uneven Qi Transformations**
This illustrates qi transformations’ irregularity, changing yearly. There is excess, insufficiency, and balanced qi. Years like *Tianfu*, *Huitong*, *Tianfu Tong*, *Changsheng Tianfu*, and *Taiyi Tianfu* are all balanced-qi years. The rest exhibit excess or insufficiency, and the means of harmonizing them through restraint and transformation depend on the practitioner.

*Verse:*
*Taiyi Tianfu* is most auspicious,
At the *Changsheng* position, blessings know no bounds;
*Suihui* and *Tianfu* are both propitious,
*Tongfu* and *Tonghui* require careful deliberation.

**Diagram of Host Qi**
This depicts the five phases’ fixed positions, unchanging through the ages. Balanced qi brings fortune, while excess or insufficiency brings misfortune. To diminish excess and supplement insufficiency, harmonizing through restraint and transformation, again depends on the practitioner. Methods like the *Hongfan*’s five phases invert true principles, rendering fortune and misfortune unverifiable. Those who discern this and attain mastery will find their responses as swift as echo.

*Verse:*
Fiery flames blaze in the south, water resides in the north,
The east’s bending-straight and the west’s Venus stand;
*Xun* wood, *Qian* metal, *Kun* and *Gen* earth,
The Yellow Matriarch’s four tombs need no mention.

**Diagram of Guest Qi**
This depicts the five qi’s flow, changing with years and months. When balanced qi prevails, one must neither allow guest qi to generate nor drain. Only when host qi is excessive should guest qi be used to drain it; when host qi is insufficient, guest qi should be used to generate it. The initial qi is the host qi. While guest qi may bring fortune, it may also bring misfortune—one cannot adhere rigidly to a single principle.

*Verse:*
Water fears earth, wood fears metal,
The metal star dreads fire, fire dreads rain;
Even the Yellow Matriarch dislikes bending-straight,
Restraint and transformation demand careful application.

**Diagram of Generation, Assistance, Restraint, and Drainage**
The marvels of creation are perfected in harmony. Generation and assistance supplement insufficiency; restraint and drainage curb excess. Just as the reckless are restrained by sages, and the overcautious are urged forward, people know only to use generation and assistance, unaware of restraint and drainage. Yet both excess and insufficiency can bring disaster. This diagram is established for easy reference.

*Verse:*
The five qi’s uses originally differ,
Harmony alone achieves divine craft;
Excess demands restraint and drainage,
Insufficiency requires generation and assistance to succeed.

**The Fivefold Movements**
Jia and Ji transform earth, Yi and Geng transform metal,
Bing and Xin transform water, Ding and Ren transform wood,
Wu and Gui transform fire, with earth at the center to command the four directions.
Thus it is said: "The ruler governs while the rest each specialize in a direction to fulfill commands—hence, the ministers govern."

Master Chen Xiyi states: The fivefold movements are the ten celestial stems’ revolutions through heaven, changing yearly. Yang years’ fivefold movements manifest excessive qi; yin years’ fivefold movements manifest insufficient qi. Those without excess or insufficiency are balanced qi, assuredly bringing fortune. Those with excess or insufficiency are perverse qi, invariably bringing disaster.

Thus, in *Jia* years, earth qi is greatly excessive, yin qi prevails, and its perversity invades water. In *Yi* years, metal qi is insufficient, fiery qi prevails, and its perversity invades metal. In *Bing* years, water qi is greatly excessive, cold qi prevails, and its perversity invades fire. In *Ding* years, wood qi is insufficient, dry qi prevails, and its perversity invades wood. In *Wu* years, fire qi is greatly excessive, scorching heat prevails, and its perversity invades metal.

In *Ji* years, earth qi is insufficient, wind qi prevails, and its perversity invades earth. In *Geng* years, metal qi is greatly excessive, dry qi prevails, and its perversity invades wood. In *Xin* years, water qi is insufficient, damp qi prevails, and its perversity invades water. In *Ren* years, wood qi is greatly excessive, wind qi prevails, and its perversity invades earth. In *Gui* years, fire qi is insufficient, cold qi prevails, and its perversity invades fire.

Only in *Jia-chen*, *Shen-xu*, *Ji-chou*, and *Ji-wei* years is earth’s balanced qi present. In *Ren-yin*, *Ren-shen*, *Ding-mao*, *Ding-si*, and *Ding-hai* years, wood’s balanced qi is present. In *Wu-zi*, *Wu-wu*, *Wu-yin*, *Wu-shen*, *Gui-mao*, *Gui-si*, *Gui-you*, and *Gui-hai* years, water’s (Kan’s) balanced qi is present. In *Geng-zi*, *Geng-wu*, *Geng-shen*, *Yi-mao*, and *Yi-you* years, metal’s balanced qi is present. In *Bing-zi*, *Bing-chen*, *Bing-shen*, *Bing-xu*, *Xin-chou*, *Xin-mao*, *Xin-wei*, and *Xin-hai* years, water’s balanced qi is present.

This fool observes: *Yin* belongs to the tiger, *chen* to the dragon—nothing is as unpredictable in transformation as dragons and tigers. Thus, the qi of transformation takes the dragon and tiger months as its basis.

Therefore, in *Jia* and *Ji* years, the first month is established as *Bing-yin*; *Bing* fire must generate earth, and counting to the *chen* month, *Wu* appears—hence it is said: *Jia-Ji* transforms earth. In *Yi* and *Geng* years, the first month is established as *Wu-yin*; *Wu* earth must generate metal, and counting to the *chen* month, *Geng* appears—hence it is said: *Yi-Geng* transforms metal. In *Bing* and *Xin* years, the first month is established as *Geng-yin*; *Geng* metal must generate water, and counting to the *chen* month, *Ren* appears—hence it is said: *Bing-Xin* transforms water. In *Ding* and *Ren* years, the first month is established as *Ren-yin*; *Ren* water must generate wood, and counting to the *chen* month, *Jia* appears—hence it is said: *Ding-Ren* transforms wood. In *Wu* and *Gui* years, the first month is established as *Jia-yin*; *Jia* wood must generate fire, and counting to the *chen* month, *Bing* appears—hence it is said: *Wu-Gui* transforms fire.

Earth serves as the ruler’s governance, standing foremost among the fivefold connections. Earth generates metal, metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire—following the cycle of generation, fire in turn generates earth; these are all the governance of ministers. Thus, they follow in sequence thereafter.

**The Six Qi**
From the beginning of Great Cold to the end of Awakening of Insects, *Jueyin* wind-wood governs, presiding over the qi of generation. From the beginning of Spring Equinox to the end of Summer Solstice, *Shaoyin* sovereign fire governs, presiding over the qi of expansion. From the beginning of Grain Full to the end of Slight Heat, *Shaoyang* ministerial fire governs, presiding over the qi of growth. From the beginning of Great Heat to the end of White Dew, *Taiyin* damp earth governs, presiding over the central qi. From the beginning of Autumn Equinox to the end of Beginning of Winter, *Yangming* dry metal governs, presiding over the qi of harvest. From the beginning of Slight Snow to the end of Slight Cold, *Taiyang* cold water governs, presiding over the qi of storage.

Master Chen of Xiyi says: The Six Qi are the qi of the twelve earthly branches, changing every sixty days. Each qi comprises four solar terms, each term three pentads, and each pentad five days.

Great Cold, Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, and Awakening of Insects are all times when wind-wood qi prevails—these forty-five days, its qi reaches due east. Spring Equinox, Pure Brightness, Grain Rain, and Beginning of Summer are all times when sovereign fire qi prevails; Grain Full, Grain in Ear, Summer Solstice, and Slight Heat are all times when ministerial fire qi prevails—these ninety days, its qi reaches due south. Great Heat, Beginning of Autumn, End of Heat, and White Dew are all times when damp earth qi prevails—these forty-five days, its qi reaches the four corners. Autumn Equinox, Cold Dew, Frost’s Descent, and Beginning of Winter are all times when dry metal qi prevails—these forty-five days, its qi reaches due west. Slight Snow, Great Snow, Winter Solstice, and Slight Cold are all times when cold water qi prevails—these forty-five days, its qi reaches due north.

Metal, water, earth, and wood all transform through form. Thus, when metal divides, it becomes light; when water divides, it becomes shallow; when earth divides, it becomes weak; when wood divides, it becomes small. Fire transforms through qi, becoming ever more abundant with division. Thus, metal, wood, water, and earth each have one, while fire alone has two.

This fool observes: To understand the movement of the Six Qi, one must also know the method of transition. Otherwise, one may err by acting before the qi arrives or after it has passed. Yet the Six Qi merely follow the seasons to determine their waxing and waning. In truth, only when qi and movement are united does supreme fortune arise.

**Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches Governing Heaven and Earth**
In *Zi-Wu* years, sovereign fire governs heaven, dry metal resides in earth. In *Chou-Wei* years, damp earth governs heaven, cold water resides in earth. In *Yin-Shen* years, ministerial fire governs heaven, wind-wood resides in earth. In *Mao-You* years, dry metal governs heaven, sovereign fire resides in earth. In *Chen-Xu* years, cold water governs heaven, damp earth resides in earth. In *Si-Hai* years, wind-wood governs heaven, ministerial fire resides in earth.

Master Chen of Xiyi says: According to Jing Fang, *Taiyang* transforms into cold water, *Yangming* into dry metal, *Shaoyang* into ministerial fire, *Taiyin* into damp earth, and *Jueyin* into wind-wood. Thus, in *Zi-Wu* years, *Shaoyin* governs heaven, *Yangming* resides in earth. In *Chou-Wei* years, *Taiyin* governs heaven, *Taiyang* resides in earth. In *Yin-Shen* years, *Shaoyang* governs heaven, *Jueyin* resides in earth. In *Mao-You* years, *Yangming* governs heaven, *Shaoyin* resides in earth. In *Chen-Xu* years, *Taiyang* governs heaven, *Taiyin* resides in earth. In *Si-Hai* years, *Jueyin* governs heaven, *Shaoyang* resides in earth.

This fool observes: In *Zi-Wu* years, sovereign fire governs heaven, for fire can generate earth.

Thus, in *Chou-Wei* years, damp earth follows, for sovereign fire is too weak to govern alone. In *Yin-Shen* years, ministerial fire follows, as earth flourishes to generate metal. In *Mao-You* years, dry metal follows, as metal flourishes to generate water. In *Chen-Xu* years, cold water follows, as water flourishes to generate wood. In *Si-Hai* years, wind-wood follows. This is the sequence of the celestial governors, completing a cycle of generation, where wood in turn generates fire.

In *Zi-Wu* years, dry metal resides in earth, and as metal flourishes, it generates water. Thus, in *Chou-Wei* years, cold water follows, and as water flourishes, it generates wood. In *Yin-Shen* years, wind-wood follows, and as wood flourishes, it generates fire. In *Mao-You* years, sovereign fire follows, for fire can generate earth. In *Chen-Xu* years, damp earth follows, but as sovereign fire is still weak, ministerial fire succeeds it. This is the sequence of the terrestrial governors, completing a cycle of generation, where earth in turn generates metal and stone.

Is this not the Dao of the ceaseless generation of the Five Phases? Moreover, *Zi-Wu* and *Mao-You* stand in opposition, *Chou-Wei* and *Chen-Xu* stand in opposition, and *Yin-Shen* and *Si-Hai* stand in opposition—is this not the Dao of the Five Phases mutually concealing their abodes?

**Host Qi and Guest Qi**
When the first qi of water encounters earth, metal, water, and fire all become guest qi. When the first qi of fire encounters earth, metal, water, and wood all become guest qi. When the second qi encounters metal, water, wood, and fire all become guest qi. When the first qi of metal encounters water, wood, fire, and earth all become guest qi. When the first qi of water encounters wood, fire, earth, and metal all become guest qi.

Master Chen of Xiyi says: Dragons arriving from the east are governed by the qi of wind-wood; those from the south by the qi of sovereign and ministerial fire; those from the four corners by the qi of damp earth; those from the west by the qi of dry metal; and those from the north by the qi of cold water. All qi beyond the host qi are guest qi.

This fool observes: The east as wood, the south as fire, the west as metal, the north as water, and the four corners as earth—these are the host qi, enduring unchanged through all ages. Guest qi, however, shift with each year and month, ceaselessly altering without constraint, as seen in the varying celestial governors and terrestrial residences each year, and the cyclical succession of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. When guest qi bring fortune, all is auspicious; when they bring misfortune, all is inauspicious. If the host qi is strong, that which restrains me is auspicious, while that which generates me is inauspicious. If the host qi is weak, that which generates me is auspicious, while that which restrains me is inauspicious. For the host qi is still, while the guest qi are dynamic. As the *Yi Jing* states: "Good and ill fortune, regret and remorse, arise from movement."

**Heavenly Convergence (Tianfu)**
*Wu-yin*, *Wu-shen*, *Wu-zi*, *Wu-wu*, *Bing-chen*, *Bing-xu*, *Ding-si*, *Ding-hai*, *Ji-chou*, *Ji-wei*, *Yi-mao*, *Yi-you*—in these, the qi of transformation aligns with the celestial governor, hence they are called *Tianfu*.

**Yearly Convergence (Suihui Tianfu)**
*Jia-chen*, *Jia-xu*, *Ji-chou*, *Ji-wei*, *Yi-you*, *Geng-shen*, *Bing-zi*, *Xin-hai*, *Ren-yin*, *Ding-mao*, *Wu-wu*, *Gui-si*—in these, the qi of transformation aligns with the year’s cyclical sign, hence they are called *Suihui Tianfu*.

**Convergence with Heaven (Tongtianfu)**
*Jia-chen*, *Jia-xu*, *Geng-zi*, *Geng-wu*, *Ren-yin*, *Ren-shen*—in these, the yang-year’s qi of transformation aligns with the terrestrial residence, hence they are called *Tongtianfu*.

**Convergence with the Year (Tongsuihui Tianfu)**
*Xin-chou*, *Xin-wei*, *Gui-si*, *Gui-hai*, *Gui-mao*, *Gui-you*—in these, the yin-year’s qi of transformation aligns with the terrestrial residence, hence they are called *Tongsuihui Tianfu*.

**Grand Unity Heavenly Convergence (Taiyi Tianfu)**
*Ji-wei*, *Ji-chou*, *Yi-you*, *Wu-wu*—these are both *Tianfu* and *Suihui*, hence they are called *Taiyi Tianfu*.

**Vital Birth Heavenly Convergence (Changsheng Tianfu)**
*Wu-yin*, *Gui-you*, *Bing-shen*, *Xin-mao*—in these, the qi of transformation occupies the position of vital birth, hence they are called *Changsheng Tianfu*. Though *Jia-yin* occupies the position of vital birth, earth qi is restrained and thus not employed. Though *Ji-you* occupies the position of vital birth, the *xiaoshen* (ominous spirit) coincides with generation and thus is not employed. Though *Wu-yin* encounters the *xiaoshen*, it also aligns with *Tianfu* and may be used.

**The Sixty Characters of Heavenly Convergence**
*Ding-mao*, *Geng-wu*, *Xin-wei*, *Ren-shen*, *Gui-you*, *Jia-xu*, *Bing-zi*, *Wu-yin*, *Yi-you*, *Bing-xu*, *Ding-hai*, *Wu-zi*, *Ji-chou*, *Xin-mao*, *Gui-si*, *Bing-shen*, *Geng-zi*, *Xin-chou*, *Ren-yin*, *Gui-mao*, *Jia-chen*, *Wu-shen*, *Xin-hai*, *Yi-mao*, *Bing-chen*, *Ding-si*, *Wu-wu*, *Ji-wei*, *Geng-shen*, *Gui-hai*.

This fool observes: The sixty characters of *Tianfu* are derived from the pairing of the Five Movements with the Six Qi, akin to the *Dayan* number. Fifty is obtained by multiplying the central heaven-five of the *Hetu* by the earth-ten. Now, if these sixty characters are each expanded to form configurations of their original qi, they become minor hexagrams. If these sixty characters are fully expanded to form configurations of mixed qi, they become major hexagrams. Further extended and elaborated upon, they multiply endlessly—is this not comparable to the *Dayan* hexagrams, which number four thousand ninety-six?

**Transcending Spirit and Connecting Qi**
A solar term is divided into three pentads, each pentad spanning five days. For instance, *Jia-zi*, *Jia-wu*, *Ji-mao*, and *Ji-you* mark the first pentad; *Jia-yin*, *Jia-shen*, *Ji-si*, and *Ji-hai* mark the middle pentad; and *Jia-chen*, *Jia-xu*, *Ji-chou*, and *Ji-wei* mark the final pentad. If the transition of a solar term occurs later while the first pentad’s marker appears earlier, the spirit is transcended and the marker is employed. If the transition occurs earlier while the first pentad’s marker appears later, the qi must be connected, and the term is not employed. Such is the method of transcending spirit and connecting qi.

I observe: when *qi* precedes the solar term, it is called *spirit*; when *spirit* follows the solar term, it is called *qi*—*spirit* and *qi* are one and the same, differing only in name. For example, if the first pentad’s marker appears three days before *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), it is employed as the *Lichun* solar term—this is what is meant by *transcending spirit*. If the first pentad’s marker appears three days after *Lichun*, one must wait until the marker’s day to employ *Lichun* as the solar term—this is what is meant by *connecting qi*. Whether the discrepancy is one or two days, or four, five, or six days, the principle remains the same. If the first pentad’s marker arrives on the same day, that day is used as the starting time; the same applies to *transcending* and *connecting* above. Five time-periods make one pentad, and three pentads comprise fifteen time-periods.

**Celestial Correspondences: A Query**
Some may ask: the method of *Celestial Correspondences* is based on balanced *qi*. Whether in excess or deficiency, it can bring about calamity. This is the true orthodoxy of the art of selection, unchanging even after ten thousand generations. Yet, upon examining its application, doubts may arise. For instance, in yin-years, when *qi* is deficient, it should be supplemented. Thus, in all *yi*-years, metal is deficient, but in *yi-mao* and *yi-you*, the metal of the *Controlling Heaven* supplements it, and in *yi-you*, the *Yearly Assembly* further supplements it. In all *ding*-years, wood is deficient, but in *ding-hai* and *ding-si*, the wood of the *Controlling Heaven* supplements it, and in *ding-mao*, the *Yearly Assembly* supplements it. In all *ji*-years, earth is deficient, but in *ji-chou* and *ji-wei*, the earth of the *Controlling Heaven* supplements it, and the *Yearly Assembly* further supplements it. In all *xin*-years, water is deficient, but in *xin-chou* and *xin-wei*, the water of the *Subterranean Spring* supplements it, and in *xin-hai*, the *Yearly Assembly* supplements it. In all *gui*-years, fire is deficient, but in *gui-mao*, *gui-si*, *gui-you*, and *gui-hai*, the fire of the *Subterranean Spring* supplements it.

Yet, in all *jia*-years, earth is in excess, so why do *jia-chen* and *jia-xu* have the earth of the *Yearly Assembly* to supplement it? In all *bing*-years, water is in excess, so why do *bing-chen* and *bing-xu* have the water of the *Controlling Heaven* to supplement it, and *bing-shen* the water of *Long Life* to supplement it? In all *wu*-years, fire is in excess, so why do *wu-zi*, *wu-yin*, *wu-wu*, and *wu-shen* have the fire of the *Controlling Heaven* to supplement it, and *wu-wu* the fire of *Taiyi* to supplement it? In all *geng*-years, metal is in excess, so why do *geng-zi* and *geng-wu* have the metal of the *Same Celestial Correspondence* to supplement it? In all *ren*-years, wood is in excess, so why do *ren-yin* and *ren-shen* have the wood of the *Subterranean Spring* to supplement it, and *ren-yin* the *Yearly Assembly* to supplement it?

To these doubts, the answer is: excess must reach its extreme before it can return to the mean. Just as cold must reach its utmost before warmth arises, and heat must peak before coolness emerges. The *Yijing* states: "When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines; when the moon is full, it wanes." Master Shao likewise regarded the full bloom of flowers as the onset of decay, and the moment of fragrant blossoming as the peak of vitality—all reflecting this principle. Only in the five yin-years, like a person of insufficient strength, must one be aided and supported before success can be achieved. Reflect upon this, and the reasoning will become clear.

**The Above Passage**
This chapter consists entirely of ancient sayings, annotated and expounded by Master Chen Xiyi.

**Elaboration on Celestial Correspondences**
*Correspondence* means alignment; *constant* means regularity. It signifies that when aligned with the celestial *qi* and its movements, it becomes the most correct and enduring Dao. Thus, it is said: the *Celestial Correspondences* are the true canon. I once reverently studied the Yellow Emperor, who commanded *Darao* to observe the handle of the Dipper and create the *jiazi* system, and *Rongcheng* to synthesize the six arts and determine the *qi* and its movements—this marked the beginning of *Celestial Correspondences*. Later, *Gui Yuqu* mastered it and composed the *Divine Calendar*, while *Qibo* transmitted the *Inner Canon*. Yao’s "revering the vast heavens and respectfully receiving the seasons," Shun’s alignment of the seven celestial bodies with the *jiheng*, and the calendrical and temporal governance of Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu—all followed this Dao. Alas, after the Qin’s burning of books, these methods were lost. Only Master Chen Xiyi, in his later work, uniquely grasped its profound subtleties with his own insight, aligning with the unbroken lineage of the ancient emperors. The five movements and six *qi* have fixed principles; the *Controlling Heaven* and *Subterranean Spring* have definitive judgments. All mechanisms of host and guest, victory and defeat, are thoroughly illuminated in their secrets.

Yet, though the ancient kings revealed its essence, later practitioners have since corrupted it. Thus, for hundreds of years until now, no one has truly understood its core. They merely know the time when the *qi* of the year arrives, claiming it sufficient for siting graves and dwellings, while disregarding whether the year, month, day, and hour align. Is this not why fortune and misfortune remain unpredictable?

After deep and repeated contemplation, I have finally grasped its teachings. Within it, there are *Celestial Correspondences*, *Yearly Assembly Celestial Correspondences*, *Same Celestial Correspondences*, *Same Yearly Assembly Celestial Correspondences*, as well as *Taiyi Celestial Correspondences* and *Long Life Celestial Correspondences*. Though the words are concise, they encompass vast meaning; though the intent is simple, it is exceedingly detailed. Yet, practitioners fail to understand it, and scholars have no time to study it—thus, the profound learning of the ancients has long remained obscure to later generations. I have therefore fully elaborated its principles to share with the world. This method neither avoids inauspicious spirits nor requires auspicious omens.

Only when the year, month, day, and hour all align with the *Celestial Correspondences* should one act—when in ascendance, it is fitting to restrain or drain; when in decline, it is fitting to nurture or support. The configuration must attain harmony before application. In great matters, this can be used to establish states and found nations; in small matters, to secure graves and settle dwellings. Even without aligning with the seven luminaries of the astral chart, one may still achieve the method of auspicious selection. This is the most correct and essential principle, which I have elaborated into fixed configurations below. If further aligned with an auspicious astral chart, the blessings will be even greater.

This section specifically discusses the *Dragon*, unrelated to sitting orientation.

**Eastern Dragon**
This is the direction governed by the qi of Wind and Wood.

**Excess and Deficiency in Transformation Qi**

*Excessive Transformation Qi*

*Deficient Transformation Qi*
*Xinsi*, *xinyou*, *guichou*, *guiwei*, *yisi*, *yiwei*, *yihai*, *yichou* all manifest deficient transformation qi.

The above four pillars employ only their native qi without admixture, termed *Zhengqi Tianfu* (Pure Qi Celestial Correspondences). When the four pillars employ either native qi, generative qi, or wealth qi in mixed combination, this is termed *Zaqi Tianfu* (Mixed Qi Celestial Correspondences). Though their names differ, their auspicious effects are the same.

If the selection aligns with year, month, day, and hour, it is most auspicious—even without matching the Seven Governors’ stellar configuration, it may still confer blessings. Only avoid sitting with the Three Killings in dominance or facing the Grand Year Star in dominance; other inauspicious spirits and baleful stars need not be feared.

Should the Seven Governors’ stellar configuration also align, this becomes a once-in-ten-thousand selection, most auspicious indeed. For those beyond the circle of balance—where excess prevails—reduce the excess to attain moderation; where deficiency prevails, draw forth the deficiency to reach equilibrium. Thus, through regulation and transformation, one achieves harmony indistinguishable from balanced qi. If the Seven Governors’ configuration also proves flawless, the arrangement is complete. Yet one must not be rigidly bound by the Seven Governors.

When Dragon qi is vigorous, even if the pillars employ restraining or draining qi, no harm arises. When Dragon qi is weak, only generative reinforcement brings auspiciousness. These two principles depend on human adaptation.

*Zhengqi Tianfu* and *Zaqi Tianfu* may be employed even by beginners. However, the *Tianfu* standard configuration may occasionally appear in discourse. Beyond this, there are *Huaxiang* (Transformation Resemblance) configurations, *Leixiang* (Category Resemblance) configurations, and six auspicious *Ge* (Format) configurations, all resembling the *Tianfu* standard. It suffices to ensure the Sun arrives at the sitting or facing direction, or the Emperor Star arrives at the sitting direction, while avoiding the Three Killings and not facing the Grand Year Star—all such periods may be used.

The methods for these three configurations are illustrated below. Not all need align perfectly; any may be employed.

**1. Huaxiang Configuration**
This configuration requires the Heavenly Stems to undergo dual transformation while the Earthly Branches form a triple union.

**2. Leixiang Configuration**
This configuration requires each element to follow its category—Wood for Wood, Fire for Fire—while the Earthly Branches form a triple union. The rest follow accordingly.

**3. Six Ge Configurations**
This configuration requires adherence to standard formats:
- For *guan* (official) or *sha* (punishment) with weak vitality, use generative qi;
- For *yin* (seal) with strong vitality, use wealth qi;
- For light *yin*, favor *guan*;
- For heavy *yin*, favor wealth;
- For abundant wealth, favor *guan* or *sha*;
- For weak wealth, fear plunder;
- *Shishen* (Food Spirit) prefers singularity; three become *shang* (injury).
- For *shangguan* (Injury Officer) with strong vitality, favor wealth or *sha*; with weak vitality, favor *yin* (seal), though wealth and *yin* must not both flourish.
*Master Zi Ping* often said: If *shangguan*, wealth, and *yin* all flourish, whence comes fortune?

*Record of Fulfilling Filial Piety in Geomancy, Compiled by a Confucian Scholar Advocating Principle and Moderation, Volume Six*
*Excerpts from* **The Nine Palaces and Purple-White** *by Xu of Qiantang*

Xu of Qiantang, a scholar of profound learning, often delved into the abstruse mysteries of the Dao amid his studies of the Classics and histories. He extensively explored the principles of yin-yang creation, the waxing and waning of cosmic forces, and the profound workings of transformation. Having directly perceived the true mechanism, he composed *The Nine Palaces and Purple-White*, a discourse that particularly expounds what former sages had left unspoken—indeed, a work that complements the *Heavenly Correspondence Classic*. Here, I compile its essence for those who savor such wisdom to ponder together.

### **General Discussion on the Waxing and Waning of the Nine Palaces and Purple-White**

The pairing of purple and white with the Nine Palaces represents the fundamental nature of the initially divided directions. The interweaving of the Nine Palaces with the Eight Trigrams embodies the profound mechanism of the Later Heaven sequence in practical application.

With forty-five, it governs the framework of the eight solar terms;
With fifteen, it distributes the circulation of a single *qi*.
North belongs to *Kan*, south to *Li*, east to *Zhen*, and west to *Dui*—establishing the four cardinal positions.
The merits and faults of the central *qi*’s duration determine the four corners: spring to *Gen*, autumn to *Kun*, summer to *Xun*, and winter to *Qian*—dividing the four intercardinal sectors.
The alternations of cold and warmth in the solar terms are further refined into seventy-two migratory phases, advancing and retreating through three hundred and sixty cycles of waxing and waning. When yin and yang intermingle, their full potential is employed; when they stand alone, half is utilized.

Yet why are they matched with distinct stars such as *Greedy Wolf*, *Great Gate*, and *Military Arts*, while the original stars of the Nine Palaces are disregarded? Why are the transformed trigrams of *Generative Qi*, *Heavenly Physician*, and *Fortune-Virtue* emphasized, while the original trigrams of the eight directions are undervalued? Thus, without discerning host and guest, flying and hidden, waxing and waning, or the interactions of restraint, depletion, transformation, and harmony, some arbitrarily deem purple and white auspicious—I fail to comprehend this.

For instance:
- *One White*, belonging to water, becomes a killer when applied to *Fire-Mountain*;
- *Six White*, belonging to metal, becomes a killer when applied to *Wood-Mountain*;
- *Eight White*, belonging to earth, becomes a killer when applied to *Water-Mountain*;
- *Nine Purple*, belonging to fire, becomes a killer when applied to *Metal-Mountain*.

Moreover, the severity varies with strength and weakness: a mild killer acts as an official, while a severe one becomes a ghost; a strong self is beneficial, while a weak one invites disaster. Even if *Morning Audience* brings fortune, a shallow root and feeble power may not confer true favor. Though *Leakage* drains *qi*, a child rescuing its mother ultimately averts great misfortune. How can purple and white be deemed entirely auspicious, while other stars are wholly inauspicious?

Those so-called *Celestial Aperture*, *White Heavenly Mirror*, *Mystery Mechanism*, *Celestial Fortune*, and other charts are nothing but deceptions that delude the world and mislead the people. They invent elaborate names to astonish the senses: when speaking of fortune, they invoke *Celestial Emolument*, *Celestial Fortune*, *Celestial Virtue*, *Celestial Wealth*, and the like, inciting insatiable desires; when speaking of misfortune, they invoke *Celestial Lament*, *Celestial Resentment*, *Celestial Disaster*, *Celestial Calamity*, and the like, instilling fear and unease. Yet when questioned on the Five Phases, mutual generation and restraint, yin-yang, or waxing and waning, they offer nothing but empty words. Is the principle of the *Luo River Diagram* unreliable? Does the form of purple and white follow some other doctrine?

Where there is substance, there is form—the colors of the Nine Palaces arise therefrom.
Where there is form, there is nature—the principles of the nine colors are thus determined.
Where there are directions, there are superimpositions—the ceaseless cycle of day and night.
Where there are superimpositions, there are sequences and reversals—the alternating dominance of winter and summer.
Where there are heaven and earth, there is interdependence—the three epochs each govern their respective phases.
Where there are cyclical *qi*, there are returns—the six *jia* periodically revert to their origins.

Thus, Chen Tuan elucidated the diagram: at the winter solstice, *jia-zi* begins at *Kan*, proceeding sequentially through the Nine Palaces to observe the growth of yang *qi*; at the summer solstice, *jia-zi* begins at *Li*, flying in reverse through the nine colors to perceive the inception of yin *qi*. The waxing and waning of yin and yang are verifiable, and the generation and restraint of the Five Phases are precise. To abandon what has already been expounded and boast of what has not been transmitted is like a painter who, finding it difficult to deceive others with familiar subjects, resorts to depicting ghosts and demons to stir the imagination.

I shall take the *Luo River Diagram* and elucidate the principles of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, revealing the mechanisms of generation, restraint, waxing, and waning. Will this not immediately expose their fallacies and deceptions?

Alas! Our dynasty selects scholars through the examination system, leaving them no leisure to attend to such arts—hence these doctrines proliferate in confusion. If one were to calmly observe the forms of the four cardinal and five intercardinal directions, harmonizing their natures of metal, wood, water, and fire; dynamically examine the origins of their flow and concealment, weighing their applications of advance, retreat, augmentation, and reduction—then the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, the contraction and extension of ghosts and spirits, could not escape the bounds of this diagram.

Accordingly, I arrange its essentials below:

Note: The Five Phases (*wuxing*) have examples of *yin* and *yang*, sequential and reverse generation, which are based on the pairing of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. However, among the Nine Palaces’ stars and *sha*, wood, metal, and earth have two each, while water and fire have only one. At the inception of the primordial chaos, only water and fire stood in opposition. Thus, in the *xiantian* (Former Heaven) arrangement, water and fire are placed at the gates of the sun and moon, while in the *houtian* (Later Heaven) arrangement, they establish the solstices of winter and summer. Since water and fire are not duplicated, it is illogical for wood, metal, and earth to be divided into two. Moreover, the authority of *yang* is weighty, while that of *yin* is light; *yin* follows *yang*, embodying the principle of the wife following the husband. Therefore, the waxing, flourishing, entombment, and perishing should not be divided into sequential and reverse patterns.

Furthermore, while it is said that *wu* earth is born in *yin* and *si* earth is born in *you*, this is conventional. According to the fundamental principles of the Five Phases, only earth resides at the junction of fire and metal, between summer and autumn, and only then does it successively generate the myriad things in the four seasons, refining their transformations. Thus, it should rightly be born in *Kun-shen*.

**Exposition on the Diagram of the Nine Palaces’ Purple and White Directions**
In my humble opinion, the ancients’ use of purple and white as auspicious was not without reason. *Six White* resides in *Qian*, the pivot of the Celestial Gate. In terms of time, it is *kai* (opening). *One White* resides in *Kan*, where *yang* *qi* first arises. In terms of time, it is *xiu* (resting). *Eight White* resides in *Gen*, where beginnings and endings are completed. In terms of time, it is *sheng* (generation). *Nine Purple* resides in *Li*, facing the light and governing administration. In terms of time, it is *jing* (prosperity). However, *Three Green* stands in opposition to the sun and moon, while *Seven Red* occupies the realm of stern desolation, bearing the omen of alarm and harm. *Four Green* represents the sprouting of things, yet *Two Black*, transmitting *yin* to send off *yang*, embodies the principle of death and stagnation. *Five Yellow* resides in the center, its position that of the sovereign, its movement that of earth. Its authority governs the four directions, its power overshadows the eight regions—those who encounter it are crushed, those who resist it are destroyed. Thus, among all the baleful stars of the various schools, none is more inauspicious than *Five Yellow*. *Five Yellow* is like the Grand Year (*Taisui*): it may be followed but must not be offended. Such is the fixed positioning of the Nine Stars.

Furthermore, the star of the central palace was named *Taisui* in ancient calendars. Once its position is fixed, *Five Yellow* governs it.

Should the stars wander and drift year by year—now as water, now as wood, now as fire, now as metal—each in turn assumes the role of sovereign. They wield authority over the year, enact the commands of the four seasons, and are not confined to the single *Five Yellow*. The accomplished withdraw, the coming advance: such is the Dao of Heaven. Thus, the star of the central palace bears most critically upon fortune and misfortune each year. For instance, if the orientation of a mountain or dwelling encounters this star, harmony or affinity will mitigate calamity, while conflict or opposition will deepen it. People today know only to avoid *Taisui*, unaware that this star is the true *Taisui*. If the mountain’s orientation aligns with this star, and the year, month, day, and hour further clash with it, the harm will be severe.

When the baleful stars of the Nine Palaces descend upon forbidden positions:
- *Dark Establishment*: a minister usurps the sovereign’s place.
- *Receiving Clash*: the guest weakens, the host strengthens.
- *Mutual Opposition*: the *Piercing Heart* baleful.
- *Metal and Metal in the same position*: the *Crossed Swords* baleful.
- *Metal, Earth, and Wood in the same position*: the *Ox-Fight* baleful.
- *Five Phases entering tomb*: the *Six Victories* baleful.

When selecting a site, establishing an orientation, or modifying a direction, even if *Purple-White* stars are present, their efficacy depends on *qi*: with *qi*, blessings are profound; without *qi*, blessings are slight. One must also consider baleful stars such as *entering tomb*, for "within the auspicious lies the baleful—few recognize this."

The above are but examples of baleful stars to avoid. To grasp their full permutations, one must first correlate the twelve earthly branches with the eight trigrams:
- *Zi* in *Kan*,
- *Chou* and *Yin* in *Gen*,
- *Mao* in *Zhen*, *Chen* in *Xun*,
- *Si* in *Xun*,
- *Wu* in *Li*,
- *Wei* and *Shen* in *Kun*,
- *You* in *Dui*, *Xu* in *Qian*,
- *Hai* in *Qian*.

For instance:
- *One White* flying to *Mao*, *Six White* flying to *Hai*, *Eight White* flying to *Si*, *Nine Purple* flying to *Li*: these are *Punishment Palaces*.
- *One White* flying to *Wu*, *Six White* flying to *Shen*, *Eight White* flying to *Si*, *Nine Purple* flying to *Chou*: these are *Harm Palaces*.

The baleful stars of the Nine Palaces invariably involve the *Three Punishments* and *Six Harms*. One must further examine the year, month, day, and hour to discern the *Four Void* positions, thereby assessing their waxing or waning influence. For example, in the *Jia-Zi* decade, the *Xu-Hai* positions are void. Any beneficent or baleful star aligning with these directions loses power and falls into weakness.

In a *Jia-Zi* year:
- From the first to the eighth month, the *Xu-Hai* positions are void.
- From the ninth to the twelfth month, the *Shen-You* positions are void.

Within the *Jia-Zi* decade, *Xu-Hai* is void, yet on yang days the yang is void, and on yin days the yin is void. The same principle applies to years and months. A single or double void diminishes the star’s power by half; a triple or quadruple void renders it entirely powerless. Generally, a void in the year affects the *qi* of a decade most severely, followed by a void in the month, then the day and hour. Once the void position passes, the star may be employed again.

Beyond punishments, harms, and voids, one must also consider *generation, support, restraint, and transformation*:
- If a *Punishment Palace* aligns with the *Nobleman* or *Office*, punishment transforms into authority.
- If a *Harm Palace* aligns with the *Salary* or *Horse*, harm transforms into utility.

When a void position encounters *generation* or *support*, it becomes substantial; when it encounters *transformation*, it shifts:
- *Generation*: water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, and water again generates wood.
- *Support*: water supports water, wood supports wood, fire supports fire, earth supports earth, metal supports metal.

- *Restraint*: water restrains fire, fire restrains metal, metal restrains wood, wood restrains earth, earth restrains water, and water again restrains fire.
- *Transformation*:
  - By heavenly stems: *Jia* and *Ji* transform into earth, *Yi* and *Geng* into metal, *Bing* and *Xin* into water, *Ding* and *Ren* into wood, *Wu* and *Gui* into fire.
  - By earthly branches: *Hai-Mao-Wei* transform into wood, *Yin-Wu-Xu* into fire, *Si-You-Chou* into metal, *Shen-Zi-Chen* into water.

The transformation of heavenly stems follows the generative and completion numbers of the *River Chart*: one-six, two-seven, three-eight, four-nine, five-ten—these are the natural pairings. The transformation of earthly branches adheres to the native palace of each trigram, where the *qi* of a single palace encompasses birth, prosperity, and tomb—naturally aligning in sequence.

Words cannot exhaust meaning; discernment lies with the adept. Illustrated explanations of the *Three-Yuan Nine-White* system follow.

In the *Upper Yuan* *Jiazi* year, the central palace begins with *One White*. The *Jiazi* year of the Hongzhi seventeenth reign (1484) marks the *Upper Yuan*. In the *Middle Yuan* *Jiazi* year, the central palace begins with *Four Green*. The *Jiazi* year of the Jiajing forty-third reign (1564) marks the *Middle Yuan*. In the *Lower Yuan* *Jiazi* year, the central palace begins with *Seven Red*.

The method of the *Three Yuan* is a system of shifting palaces and exchanging *qi*. This is the wondrous principle of ceaseless cyclical recurrence since the opening of Heaven and Earth. The Dao of the *Yijing* proceeds from one to two, from two to three, and through the interlocking of three and five to generate transformation—how could it not begin from one? *One White* resides in *Kan*, the palace of *Xuanming*, corresponding to the number of *Taiyi* and the root of Heaven in *Fu*. Thus, the *Upper Yuan* *Jiazi* commences here, completing three cycles before returning to this origin—how wondrous! Those who perceive this mechanism are as Shao Yong said: "as if personally witnessing Fu Xi’s arrival."

All subsequent months, days, and hours follow this principle.

I observe: regulating the calendar and clarifying the seasons is the primary duty of emperors. Thus, when presenting the coming year’s almanac, a memorial is first composed, and the completed calendar is burned in offering to the Emperor. It is said: "The common people know not how to avoid harm, so the court determines the seasons, dawn and dusk, the auspices of days and months, and promulgates them throughout the realm. Should any error occur in the reckoning of celestial phenomena, the officials shall bear full responsibility, sparing the people from fault."

Yet today’s divination practitioners do not adhere to the court’s regulations but instead peddle secret teachings to the ignorant. Why do they not consider: whose measure of fortune is greater? The court’s or theirs? Whose astronomical calculations are more precise? The court’s specialized officials who observe the heavens and monitor *qi*, or theirs? The officials of the Imperial Bureau of Astronomy have never produced a figure of Yi Xing’s insight or Yelü Chucai’s erudition, yet they act with self-assurance, misleading others profoundly.

The almanac begins with the *Nine White* diagram for the year, followed by detailed monthly diagrams. Diagrams for days and hours are too numerous to record, so they are omitted, awaiting those capable of deducing them by analogy. Alas! The statutes of our dynasty are disregarded, and absurd heterodoxies are often interspersed—how strange and egregious! Thus, I have systematically arranged these principles to facilitate the promotion of orthodoxy and practical application.

**Diagrams of the Three Yuan and Monthly White System**
In *Upper Yuan* years (*Zi-Wu-Mao-You*), the central palace begins with *Eight White* in the first month, *Seven Red* in the second.
In *Middle Yuan* years (*Chen-Xu-Chou-Wei*), the central palace begins with *Five Yellow* in the first month, *Four Green* in the second.
In *Lower Yuan* years (*Yin-Shen-Si-Hai*), the central palace begins with *Two Black* in the first month, *One White* in the second.
All proceed in reverse order, flying sequentially.

Why divide months by the *Three Yuan*? The year after *Zi* is *Chou*, and the year after *Chou* is *Yin*—this is the sequence of *Upper*, *Middle*, and *Lower Yuan*. Why does *Mao* return to the *Upper Yuan*? The *Luo River Writing* contains only nine palaces, and each year has twelve months. Over three years, this totals thirty-six months, matching the number four times nine. The cycle traverses four rounds before returning to the original position. Thus, in the first month of a *Zi* year, *Eight White* begins, and the same occurs in the first month of a *Mao* year. From *Mao* to *Chen* to *Si* to *Wu*, the pattern repeats—this is the ancient method of establishment, and the rest may be deduced by analogy.

**Fixed Palaces of the Three Yuan and Monthly White System**
*Upper Yuan* years (*Zi-Wu-Mao-You*):

These are the monthly guiding principles, summarizing the fortunes and misfortunes of the entire year. Their directions are fixed and unchanging, yet their authority, though supreme, is not absolute. As for monthly *shen* and *sha*, the flying and settling of *diaoti*, and their alignment with mountains and orientations—these determine fortune and misfortune most critically. One must clearly understand the methods of weighing their relative importance and making choices.

For instance, according to the *benqi* (original qi) of the Five Phases:
- Wood mountains are auspicious in spring months,
- Fire mountains in summer months,
- Metal mountains in autumn months,
- Water mountains in winter months,
- Earth mountains in the four seasonal months.

According to the *jinqi* (advancing qi) of the Five Phases:
- Wood mountains are auspicious in winter months,
- Fire mountains in spring months,
- Earth mountains in summer months,
- Water mountains in autumn months,
- Metal mountains in the four seasonal months.

According to the *caiqi* (wealth qi) of the Five Phases:
- Metal months are auspicious in spring months,
- Water mountains in summer months,
- Fire mountains in autumn months,
- Earth mountains in winter months,
- Wood mountains in the four seasonal months.

According to the *tuiqi* (retreating qi) of the Five Phases:
- Water mountains are inauspicious in spring months,
- Wood mountains in summer months,
- Earth mountains in autumn months,
- Metal mountains in winter months,
- Fire mountains in the four seasonal months.

According to the *guiqi* (ghost qi) of the Five Phases:
- Earth mountains are inauspicious in spring months,
- Metal mountains in summer months,
- Wood mountains in autumn months,
- Fire mountains in winter months,
- Water mountains in the four seasonal months.

One must also coordinate these with the auspicious and inauspicious aspects of the *zi bai* (Purple-White Stars):
- For Wood mountains, *One White* is favorable as a life-generating star, though its power is weak in spring and the four seasonal months; *Eight White* is favorable as a wealth star, though its power is weak in autumn and spring. *Six White* is inauspicious as a ghost star, but harmless in winter and summer; *Nine Purple* is inauspicious as a draining star, but harmless in the four seasonal months and winter.

- For Water mountains, *Six White* is favorable as a life-generating star, though its power is weak in winter and summer; *Nine Purple* is favorable as a wealth star, though its power is weak in the four seasonal months and winter. *Eight White* is inauspicious as a ghost star, but harmless in autumn and spring.

- For Metal mountains, *Eight White* is favorable as a life-generating star, though its power is weak in autumn and spring; *One White* is inauspicious as a draining star, but harmless in spring and the four seasonal months; *Nine Purple* is inauspicious as a ghost star, but harmless in the four seasonal months and winter.

- For Earth mountains, *Nine Purple* is favorable as a life-generating star, though its power is weak in the four seasonal months and winter; *One White* is favorable as a wealth star, though its power is weak in spring and the four seasonal months. *Six White* is inauspicious as a draining star, but harmless in winter and summer.

- For Fire mountains, *Six White* is favorable as a wealth star, though its power is weak in winter and summer; *One White* is inauspicious as a ghost star, but harmless in spring and the four seasonal months; *Eight White* is inauspicious as a draining star, but harmless in autumn and spring.

Generally, when an auspicious star is restrained or drained, its power weakens; when an inauspicious star is restrained or drained, its malevolence diminishes. One must also coordinate these with the months, the stems and branches of the monthly *jian*, and the *na yin* (sound absorption) to examine their transformations.

For example:
- In a *jiazi* year, *One White* corresponds to *bingzi*, and its *na yin* sound is still considered Water.
- *Six White* corresponds to *yihai*, and its *na yin* sound changes to Fire, thus considered Fire.
- *Eight White* corresponds to *bingyin*, and its *na yin* sound also changes to Fire, thus considered Fire.
- *Nine Purple* corresponds to *gengwu*, and its *na yin* sound changes to Earth, thus considered Earth.

Each year, the *Tai Sui* governs twelve months, each with its designated position, all corresponding to the eight directions. Nowadays, people simplistically assign *One White* to Water, *Six White* to Metal, *Eight White* to Earth, and *Nine Purple* to Fire to determine fortune and misfortune—how can they not be confused when their methods prove ineffective?

In my humble opinion: The transformations of creation exist between Heaven and Earth. The north as Water, south as Fire, east as Wood, and west as Metal are the eternal positions of the Five Phases, their fixed forms. Yet the marvel of their application lies in their yearly divisions, monthly governance, and the ever-changing movements of *diaoti*. As the *Yi Jing* states: *"Change leads to penetration, and penetration leads to endurance."* Without change, how can one speak of the transformations of creation? However, this is merely the most fundamental principle, free from forced interpretations or interruptions. It is for those who understand these principles to deduce and determine their choices.

**Diagram and Explanation of the Three Yuan Daily White Star Sequence**

**Yang Dun after Winter Solstice:**

As Chen Xiyi’s *Key to the Three Yuan for Day Selection* states:
*"Yang arises before and after Winter Solstice, moving forward with *jiazi* one palace at a time.
At Rain Water, begin from the seventh palace; at Grain Rain, return to reckon from Xun.
Yin arises after Summer Solstice, shifting through the nine palaces.
Before and after End of Heat, doubt not the third palace.
At Frost Descent, *jiazi* begins from the sixth palace—
Reverse and forward are clear in the twelve branches."*

For the various methods of daily White Stars, confusion and errors abound.
Only this *Three Yuan Day Selection Formula* maintains the continuity of yin-yang and forward-reverse sequences, perfectly preserving the ancient principle of "shifting palaces to connect with the qi."

The most critical factor is the day’s ruler, which must correlate usefully with the mountain’s destiny.
For example, in spring, *wu* and *ji* are weak and useless; in the *yin* month, *si* days suffer triple punishment; in the *mao* month, *chen* days endure six harms. Opposing the Grand Year is called "great defeat."
*Chou* days in the *wei* month are always inauspicious.
Days of "eating, submission, extinction, and disappearance" are especially unfavorable—even with Purple-White stars, they bring no good.

**Diagram and Explanation of Three Yuan Hourly White Star Sequence**

**After Winter Solstice, Yang Dun:** Change sequence every five days, dividing into two yuan. (Old texts placed the middle yuan at *chen-xu-chou-wei*; this is corrected.)
- **Upper Yuan:** On *jia* or *ji* days meeting *zi-wu-mao-you*, begin with *One White* at *jiazi*.
- **Middle Yuan:** On *jia* or *ji* days meeting *yin-shen-si-hai*, begin with *Seven Red* at *jiazi*.
- **Lower Yuan:** On *jia* or *ji* days meeting *chen-xu-chou-wei*, begin with *Four Green* at *jiazi*.
All proceed in forward order to determine the hourly star, entering the central palace and flying sequentially to the eight directions.

**After Summer Solstice, Yin Dun:** Change sequence every five days, dividing into three yuan. (Old texts placed the middle yuan at *chen-xu-chou-wei*; this is corrected.)
- **Upper Yuan:** On *jia* or *ji* days meeting *zi-wu-mao-you*, begin with *Nine Purple* at *jiazi*.
- **Middle Yuan:** On *jia* or *ji* days meeting *yin-shen-si-hai*, begin with *Three Azure* at *jiazi*.
- **Lower Yuan:** On *jia* or *ji* days meeting *chen-xu-chou-wei*, begin with *Six White* at *jiazi*.
All proceed in reverse order to determine the hourly star, entering the central palace and flying sequentially to the eight directions.

**After Winter Solstice, Yang Dun: Hourly White Star Direction Fixed Sequence**
(All begin at *jiazi*, not the Five-Child Rotation. Old texts contain errors.)

One White: Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian
Two Black: Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui
Three Azure: Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen
Four Green: Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li
Five Yellow: Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan

**Six White:** Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun
**Seven Red:** Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen
**Eight White:** Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun
**Nine Purple:** Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center

*Note:* Common almanacs fix the hourly White Star by taking *chen-xu-chou-wei* as the Middle Yuan and *yin-shen-si-hai* as the Lower Yuan, which is gravely erroneous. The ancients established the Three Yuan method such that the Nine Palaces’ flying sequence must complete three *jiazi* cycles before returning to the original position. For instance, if the first *jiazi* begins at *One Kan*, the second *jiazi* naturally begins at *Seven Dui*, and the third *jiazi* at *Four Xun*—a fixed, interlocking system. The later sequence of reverse *dun* (Yang *dun* after Winter Solstice begins at *Li*) follows the same principle. Taking *chen-xu-chou-wei* as the Middle Yuan contradicts this method.

**After Summer Solstice, Yin Dun: Hourly White Star Direction Fixed Sequence**
(All begin at *jiazi*, not the Five-Child Rotation. Old texts contain errors.)

**Nine Purple:** Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian
**Eight White:** Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui
**Seven Red:** Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen
**Six White:** Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li
**Five Yellow:** Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun Kan
**Six White:** Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen Kun
**Seven Red:** Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun Zhen
**Eight White:** Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center Xun
**Nine Purple:** Xun Zhen Kun Kan Li Gen Dui Qian Center

*Further Note:* The practice of taking *chen-xu-chou-wei* as the Middle Yuan stems from erroneously applying the monthly White Star method to hourly calculations, perpetuating the mistake. The ancients devised this shortcut to avoid the cumbersome task of tallying accumulated years and days in the celestial cycle. For monthly White Stars, the *zi* year is the Upper Yuan, so the *chou* year becomes the Middle Yuan—since the twelfth month of the *zi* year directly precedes the first month of the *chou* year. For example, in the twelfth month of the *zi* year, *Six White* occupies the central palace; thus, in the first month of the *chou* year, *Five Yellow* advances to replace it. This is the method of matching twelve palaces with nine palaces. However, hourly White Stars must traverse all sixty *jiazi* cycles, with each Yuan changing every five days. If the sequence begins on a *jiazi* day, the *jiazi* hour must wait until the *ji-si* day to complete a full cycle—meaning the *zi* day is the Upper Yuan, and the *si* day should be the Middle Yuan, a system of matching sixty hours with nine palaces. Moreover, the Yin and Yang *dun* differ in forward and reverse sequences, diverging significantly from the monthly method and violating logic. Here, corrections are made. For instance, if the monthly method starts with *jiazi* on the first day, the next day should be *bingzi*, not another *jiazi*. If *One White* is placed sequentially on the first day, the next day should be *Four Green*, not *Seven Red*. If *Nine Purple* is placed in reverse on the first day, the next day should be *Six White*, not *Three Azure*. Only then does it align with the twelve-palace calculation method. Otherwise, how could the *zi* day be the Upper Yuan and the *chou* day the Middle Yuan?

**Outline of the Tai Sui Single Star Method**

The Tai Sui single star brings calamities hard to guard,
All inauspicious stars and dangers cannot be withstood.
Simply calculate the Three Yuan’s own sequence,
Those who offend it will suffer heavy mourning in their homes.

The Tai Sui single star—who does not know?
Within each year lies a time of misfortune.
Its monthly progression is most subtle,
With no fixed pattern or constant rule.

For example, in the Upper Yuan *jiazi* year,
*One White* arrives at the palace and flies to the nine heavens.
At *Zi*, *Six* is obtained again in the palace,
Then returning to *Li*—words cannot describe the dread.

The method: Place the Three Yuan’s annual star in the central palace, then locate the Tai Sui’s own palace. The star found there is moved to the central palace to determine the annual star’s position. The annual star is the star of the central palace for that year, hence called the Tai Sui single star.

For instance, in the Upper Yuan *jiazi* year, *One White* enters the central palace. Counting forward to the Tai Sui’s position at *Kan*, *Six White* is obtained. Then place *Six White* in the central palace and locate *One White* at *Li*. *Li* contains the character *Wu* (午). Check which palace *Wu* falls into each month, then trace *One White* alongside *Wu*—this is the true Tai Sui single star.

Modern practitioners mistakenly name the opposite of Tai Sui as the "broken year" position, but this is not the single star.

- *Zi* year: Tai Sui at *Kan*
- *Chou* and *Yin* years: Tai Sui at *Gen*
- *Mao* year: Tai Sui at *Zhen*
- *Chen* and *Si* years: Tai Sui at *Xun*
- *Wu* year: Tai Sui at *Li*
- *Wei* and *Shen* years: Tai Sui at *Kun*
- *You* year: Tai Sui at *Dui*
- *Xu* and *Hai* years: Tai Sui at *Qian*

Trace the palace monthly to discern the inauspicious period,
Always beware of the Tai Sui’s relentless pursuit.
For example, if *One White* resides at *Li*,
In the second month, it moves to *Gen* to offend it.

For instance, in the Upper Yuan *jiazi* year, the second month is *ding-mao*. Move *Mao* to the central palace and locate *Wu* at *Gen*.

- In *zi-wu-mao-you* years:
  - First month: *Eight White* starts in the central palace
  - Second month: *Seven Red* starts in the central palace
  - Sequential flight: *Eight White* → *Qian* → *Nine Purple* → *Dui* → *One White*, then to *Gen*, where the monthly *Wu* also arrives—most inauspicious.

**Water-Fire Tai Sui: What harm does it bring?**
It surely causes heavy mourning and sparks of war.
For example, in the Upper Yuan *jiazi* year, *One White* is the Tai Sui single star. In the third month, *Six White* is in the central palace, and *One White* flies to *Li*—water entering the fire region, heralding heavy mourning.

**Water-Metal Tai Sui: What misfortune does it bring?**
Lust and chaos in the inner chambers, disasters abound.
Wives are harmed, elders lost—suffering is vast.
For example, in the Upper Yuan *jiazi* year, *One White* is the Tai Sui. In the first month, *Eight White* is in the central palace, and *One White* flies to *Dui*—water entering the metal palace, bringing lust and disorder.

**Kan** governs the middle son, thus it presides over misfortunes in the central chamber. When the Tai Sui occupies a direction, one is not free—water and earth bring pestilence and pox as harbingers of sorrow.
For example, in the Upper Yuan *jiazi* year, in the second month, *Seven Red* resides in the central palace, and *One White* flies sequentially to *Gen*—this is the Tai Sui of water and earth, presiding over epidemics.

Water and fire bring loss of wealth and self-hanging; when water and fire meet, snakes and dogs grieve.
For example, in the Upper Yuan *jiazi* year, in the seventh month, *Two Black* is in the central palace, and *One White* flies to *Xun*—water entering the wood region. In the fourth month, *Five Yellow* is in the central palace, and *One White* flies to *Kan*—water entering the water region.
The aforementioned afflictions, if not accompanied by punishment or combination, do not result in major disasters.

Fire and wood bring grievous harm through punishment and injury; fire and metal, though productive, harm the fetus.
Fire and earth bring illness and early death; water and fire further harm infants.
Wood and water bring wind-borne harm and violent death; wood and metal lead to imprisonment and death.
Wood and earth cause fractures and abscesses; wood and fire bring harm swift as a blade.
Metal and metal bring short lives and violent ends; wood and wood bring goiters and epilepsy.
Earth and earth bring blindness and muteness—these are the interconnected principles of the Five Phases’ afflictions.

I urge you to further employ the transformations of the *Diao* palace, and the auspicious and inauspicious will be clearly before your eyes.
The above discusses the general judgments of the Tai Sui single star, illustrating the mechanisms of the Five Phases’ resonances.
From this, it is evident that the mutual generation, conquest, restraint, and transformation of the Nine Stars do not depart from the waxing and waning of the Five Phases and the eight directions. All calculations ultimately return to a single principle: the year and month serve as the outline, though weighty, while the day and hour act as the pivot—no small matter indeed.
Further integrating the cyclical movements of *yunqi* and the permutations of *qimen*, then all unfounded precedents may be discarded, and baseless heterodoxies will crumble of themselves.
Mencius said: *"When the classics are rectified, the people will be free from depravity."* Are not the books of the *He* and *Luo* the very classics for extinguishing heterodoxy?
Though I am not talented, I have arranged these discussions in order as above, awaiting those who come after.

*End of Volume Six of* **The Confucian School’s Esteem for Principle: A Balanced Compilation of Kan Yu and Filial Piety**
*Beginning of Volume Seven of* **The Confucian School’s Esteem for Principle: A Balanced Compilation of Kan Yu and Filial Piety**

**Introduction to the Five Stars and Fate**
*Kanyu* fate-calculation is the same as Five-Star fate-divination. Five-Star fate-divination emphasizes the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of stellar bodies to determine fortune or misfortune. *Kanyu* fate-calculation also examines the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of stellar bodies to guide avoidance or pursuit. The difference is that astrologers additionally weigh the *caigong* (Palace of Wealth), whereas fate-calculation does not. Astrologers may establish the body and fate in *Mao*, while fate-calculation does so based on the hour employed—this is a minor distinction. Nevertheless, the principles of astrology should not be ignored, hence I have compiled this brief introduction.

At *Lidong*, two proceed,
at *Xiaoxue*, two arrive.
At *Daxue*, six approach,
at *Dongzhi*, four press close.
At *Xiaohan*, ten connect,
at *Dahan*, the Ox holds two straight.

**Degrees of the Moon’s Movement**
To know the degrees of the Moon’s movement,
its nodes begin at *Wei*.
Each day it travels thirteen degrees,
shifting through two palaces every three days.
*Kui* and *Wei* follow *Bi*,
*Jing* and *Liu* dwell in *Zhang*.
The Moon takes *Yi* as its starting point,
*Jiao* and *Kang* as its journey.
The Moon takes *Fang* as its origin,
*Jian* and *Ji* are carefully sought.
The Moon’s *Qianniu* must be known,
its degrees in the celestial cycle are precise.

**Morning and Evening Degrees**
Evening degrees begin at *You*; for those born from the first to the fifteenth or sixteenth day, count from *You*, advancing one degree per hour. For *You*, *Xu*, and *Hai*, count forward; for *Shen*, *Wei*, *Wu*, *Si*, *Chen*, *Mao*, *Yin*, *Chou*, and *Zi*, count backward.
Morning degrees begin at *Mao*; for those born from the fifteenth or sixteenth to the thirtieth day, count from *Mao*, advancing one degree per hour. For *Mao*, *Chen*, *Si*, *Wu*, *Wei*, *Shen*, *You*, *Xu*, and *Hai*, count forward; for *Yin*, *Chou*, and *Zi*, count backward.

From the first to the fourth day, the Moon moves most swiftly, traversing over fourteen degrees in a day and night. From the fifth to the eighth day, the Moon’s motion is moderate, traversing over thirteen degrees in a day and night. From the ninth to the nineteenth day, the Moon moves slowly, traversing over twelve degrees in a day and night. From the twentieth to the twenty-third day, the Moon moves with slight swiftness, traversing over thirteen degrees in a day and night. From the twenty-fourth to the thirtieth day, the Moon moves with great swiftness, traversing over fourteen degrees in a day and night.

**Degrees of Celestial Bodies**
The Sun traverses one degree per day, one palace per month, and completes one celestial cycle in a year. The Moon traverses thirteen degrees per day, one palace every two and a half days, and completes one celestial cycle in a month. Jupiter moves forward, traversing one degree every five days, one palace per year, and completes one celestial cycle in twelve years. Mars moves forward, traversing one degree every half day, one palace every two months, and completes one celestial cycle in two years. Saturn moves forward, traversing one degree every ten days, one palace every twenty-eight months, and completes one celestial cycle in twenty-eight years. Venus moves forward, traversing one degree per day, one palace per month, and completes one celestial cycle in a year. Mercury moves forward, traversing one degree per day, one palace per month, and completes one celestial cycle in a year. The Purple Qi traverses one degree every twenty-nine days, one palace every twenty-nine months, and completes one celestial cycle in twenty-nine years. The Comet traverses one degree every nine days, one palace every nine months, and completes one celestial cycle in nine years. Rahu and Ketu traverse one degree every eighteen days, one palace every eighteen months, and complete one celestial cycle in eighteen years.

Of the nine celestial bodies—the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury, *qi*, and Comet—all move forward in degrees but backward in palaces. Only Rahu and Ketu move forward in palaces but backward in degrees.

Whenever Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, or Mercury exhibit phases of slowness, station, concealment, or retrogradation, their appearances at dawn and dusk must be carefully examined. Among these, the Moon’s degrees are particularly noted: after the new moon, it follows the evening degrees; after the full moon, it follows the morning degrees. These must be meticulously calculated.

**Method for Determining the Life Palace**
The Moon is the body star. The degree where the Moon resides becomes the master of one’s body degree. Add the birth hour to the Sun’s palace, counting forward until reaching *Mao*, which is the Life Palace. For example, if the Sun is in the *Zi* palace and the person is born at the *You* hour, add the *You* hour to the *Zi* palace and count forward to *Wu*, where *Mao* is encountered—this is the Life Palace. Since the Sun rises at *Mao*, *Mao* is designated as the Life Palace. The degree of the Sun opposite the degree of the Life Palace is the Life Degree. For instance, if the Sun resides at six degrees in the *Xu* palace, it opposes five degrees in the *Wu* palace—this is the Life Degree. If the Sun resides at three degrees in the *Nü* palace, it opposes four degrees in the *Liu* mansion—this is the Life Degree. The rest follow this example.

**The Twelve Palaces**
Life Palace, Wealth, Siblings, Property, Children, Servants, Spouse, Illness, Migration, Career, Blessings, Appearance.

To determine the twelve palaces, count backward in rotation. For example, if the Life Palace is in *Yin*, Wealth is in *Si*, Siblings in *Zi*, Property in *Hai*, Children in *Xu*, Servants in *You*, Spouse in *Shen*, Illness in *Wei*, and so forth.

**Method for Determining the Annual Limit**
The annual limit is determined by the palace and position of the Life Degree. For example, if the Life Degree is at five degrees in the *Xing* mansion, located in the fifth position of the *Wu* palace on the star chart, the annual limit begins at fifteen years. If the Life Degree is at three, four, or five degrees, the annual limit begins at eleven years. If the Life Degree is at eleven, twelve, or thirteen degrees in the *Zhang* mansion, the annual limit begins at twenty years.

Generally, the annual limit starts as early as eleven years or as late as twenty years. Counting from the degrees on the star chart is more convenient, though the *Liangtianchi* (measuring celestial ruler) is more precise.

**Verses on Annual Divisions**
Fifteen and ten,
Eleven is clear.
Fifteen is the highest position,
Only eight years of provisions remain.
Seven and six times six,
Five years strong.
Sum them,
Four and a half years settle the minutest details.

**Verses on Degrees of Motion**
Degrees of motion vary in depth,
Three degrees stand in one year.
Two degrees pass in one year,
Three years together make ten.
A year with four degrees strong,
Three years above add one more.
Three degrees shift,
Three years subtract one as the standard.
Sum them,
One year with seven degrees, subtract one.
Each five years,
A year with six degrees proceeds without fail.
If one can follow this discourse on annual motion,
Fortune and misfortune will be clearly known year by year.

The above methods for determining limits and years follow the preceding examples. However, the ancient method of a fifteen-year Life Palace should not be rigidly adhered to. For those whose annual limit begins at eleven, the Life Palace governs only ten years, or three additional degrees, as one degree is traversed every three years. For those whose annual limit begins at twenty, the Life Palace governs nineteen years, approximately twenty-six or twenty-seven degrees, as one degree is traversed every year and a half. The rest can be inferred similarly.

The depth of the Life Palace’s degrees and the degrees traversed by the annual limit are called the *Liangtianchi*. The Life Palace above and the *Liangtianchi* are both fixed methods for determining fate. The Life Palace is found by adding the *Mao* hour to the Sun’s palace and degree, then counting to the birth hour. The *Liangtianchi* is found by adding the birth hour to the Sun’s palace and degree, then counting to *Mao*. Though the counting methods differ, their essence is the same. Examining each palace is cumbersome; the *Liangtianchi* offers a swift and convenient method—using it alone is sufficient.

As the *Liangtianchi* method determines fate by fixed nodal points, it cannot account for every initial degree, so discrepancies of one or two degrees may occur. Only by cross-referencing with the calculations for each palace can precision to the minute and second be achieved.

The time of birth used by astrologers is the same as that employed by geomancers—this should not be rigidly adhered to.

**Methods of Observation**

**Stars**
Stars refer to the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury, *qi*, Comet, *Rāhu*, *Ketu*, as well as the Literary Brilliance, Named Stem, Official Seal, Warp-and-Weft, Post Horse, Three Origins, Four Origins, Promotion Catalyst, Emolument Spirit, Auspicious Spirit, Rank, Ten *Yu*, and Transformative Luminaries.

**Malefics**
Malefics refer to the Emolument Effort, Yearly Chariot, Heavenly One, Jade Hall, Dipper Handle, Hexagram *Qi*, Tang Talisman, State Seal, as well as the Yang Blade, Sword Edge, Heavenly Male, Earthly Female, Flying Lament, Precise Killer, Death Spirit, Four Wastes, and Four Talismans.

**Palaces**
Palaces and their rulers: *Zi* and *Chou* Palaces (Earth), *Yin* and *Hai* Palaces (Wood), *Mao* and *Xu* Palaces (Fire), *Chen* and *You* Palaces (Metal), *Si* and *Shen* Palaces (Water), *Wu* Palace (Sun), and *Wei* Palace (Moon).

**Degrees**
Degrees and their rulers: *Jiao*, *Dou*, *Kui*, and *Jing* Degrees (Water); *Kang*, *Niu*, *Lou*, and *Gui* Degrees (Metal); *Di*, *Nü*, *Wei*, and *Liu* Degrees (Earth); *Fang*, *Xu*, *Mao*, and *Xing* Degrees (Sun); *Xin*, *Wei*, *Bi*, and *Zhang* Degrees (Moon); *Wei*, *Shi*, *Zi*, and *Yi* Degrees (Fire); *Ji*, *Bi*, *Shen*, and *Zhen* Degrees (Water).

**Strong Palaces**
Strong palaces include the Life Palace, Official Emolument, Fields and Dwellings, Spouses and Concubines, Children, Blessings and Virtue, and Wealth. It is also said that Wealth is slightly weaker, as it opposes the Life Palace.

**Weak Palaces**
Weak palaces include Siblings, Servants, Illness and Calamity, Appearance, and Migration. It is also said that Migration is nearly strong, as it faces the Life Palace.

**Body**
The *Body* is static. It is also called the original fixed star chart, upon which the Seven Governors and Four Remainders are arranged. It governs the body, life, official rank, blessings, fields, wealth, spouse, descendants, Literary Brilliance, Warp-and-Weft, Three Origins, Four Origins, and other stars.

**Use**
The *Use* is dynamic. It also refers to the movement through the celestial degrees, governing the Greater and Lesser Limits, the annual flow of the Eleven Luminaries, the Year Star, and the distribution of palaces and malefics.

**Engendering**
Engendering is mutual generation. Wood engenders Fire, Fire engenders Earth, Earth engenders Metal, Metal engenders Water, and Water engenders Wood. For stars governing the body, life, official rank, blessings, fields, wealth, spouse, and descendants, it is auspicious when others come to engender me.

**Restriction**
Restriction is mutual restraint. Wood restricts Earth, Earth restricts Water, Water restricts Fire, Fire restricts Metal, and Metal restricts Wood. For stars governing the body, fields, wealth, spouse, descendants, official rank, and blessings, it is strictly forbidden when others come to restrict me.

**Control**
Control is a form of restraint. When Metal restricts Wood, Fire controls it; when Fire restricts Metal, Water controls it; when Water restricts Fire, Earth controls it; when Earth restricts Water, Wood controls it; when Wood restricts Earth, Metal controls it.

**Transformation**
Transformation is a form of generation. When Metal restricts Wood, Water transforms it; when Water restricts Fire, Wood transforms it; when Wood restricts Earth, Fire transforms it; when Fire restricts Metal, Earth transforms it; when Earth restricts Water, Metal transforms it.

**Opposition**
Opposition is mutual reflection. *Zi* and *Wu* oppose each other, *Chou* and *Wei* oppose each other, *Yin* and *Shen* oppose each other, *Mao* and *You* oppose each other, *Chen* and *Xu* oppose each other, and *Si* and *Hai* oppose each other. If the opposition is auspicious, it is auspicious; if inauspicious, it is inauspicious.

**Harmony**
Harmony is mutual convergence. *Shen*, *Zi*, and *Chen* converge; *Yin*, *Wu*, and *Xu* converge; *Si*, *You*, and *Chou* converge; *Hai*, *Mao*, and *Wei* converge. If the convergence is auspicious, it is auspicious; if inauspicious, it is inauspicious.

**Facing**
Facing refers to the orientation of stars. For example, the Sun and Moon facing, official rank and blessings facing, fields and wealth facing, Literary Brilliance facing, Warp-and-Weft facing, Three Origins and Four Origins facing, or a single dominant star facing.

**Turning Away**
Turning away refers to the retreat of multiple luminaries. For instance, when *Ketu* and *Rāhu* intercept stars in the southeast while the fate limit passes through the northwest, or when they intercept stars in the northwest while the fate limit lies in the southeast. It is also when the Sun and Moon turn away, and all stars sink into obscurity.

**Before and After**
There are two perspectives on before and after.

Just as the *Zi* palace serves as the center, the *Chou* palace is before it and the *Hai* palace behind—this defines the "before and after" of palaces. When *Jiao* degrees serve as the center, *Kang* degrees are before and *Zhen* degrees behind—this defines the "before and after" of degrees. In fate-limit analysis, the "before and after" of palaces determine fortune or misfortune. In stellar configurations, the "before and after" of degrees settle blessings or calamities. There are also distinctions of "before and after" within the same palace, as well as within the same degree.

**After**
The *Classic* states: When the Sun and Moon occupy the same palace, the Moon must be positioned before the Sun. For example, the Moon in *Jing* and the Sun in *Bi*. It also says: When Venus and Mercury meet in the same enclosure, Mercury must not retreat behind Venus. For instance, Mercury in *Jing* and Venus in *Bi*. There are also distinctions of "before and after" in mutual overcoming. If Earth is in *Jing* and Water in *Bi*, the misfortune is light. If Earth is in *Bi* and Water in *Jing*, the misfortune is grave. Generally, stars that generate me should be behind, while stars that overcome me should be before. The rest can be deduced accordingly.

**Welcoming**
"Welcoming" means a star lies ahead. For example, if the fate limit is in *Yin* and a star is in *Mao*, this is called "inter-palace welcoming." If the fate limit is in *Ji* and a star is in *Wei* degrees, this is called "inter-degree welcoming." The former is minor, the latter significant.

**Sending Off**
"Sending off" means a star lies behind. For example, if the fate limit is in *Yin* and a star is in *Chou*, this is called "inter-palace sending off." If the fate limit is in *Ji* and a star is in *Wei* degrees, this is called "inter-degree sending off." The former is distant, the latter proximate.

**Bright**
"Bright" refers to stars that align with daylight or night. For those born in daylight: the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, *qi*, *Ketu*, and *comets*. For those born at night: the Moon, Mars, Venus, and *Rāhu*—these are called "facing brightness." When they govern the body, fate, fields, wealth, official blessings, warp-and-weft, post horses, the Three Origins, or emolument stars, they are considered auspicious.

**Obscure**
"Obscure" refers to stars that oppose daylight or night. For those born at night: Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, *darkness*, *Ketu*, and *comets*. For those born in daylight: the Moon, Mars, Venus, and *Rāhu*—these are called "turning away from luminaries." Or when they govern the body, fate, fields, wealth, or official blessings, and stars like Literary Brilliance or *Ming Jia* lose their proper positions.

**Ascending**
"Ascending" means the Sun is in the east, favoring those born in *Yin*, *Mao*, *Chen*, *Si*, *Wu*, or *Wei* hours. The Moon is in the west, favoring those born in *Shen*, *You*, *Xu*, *Hai*, *Zi*, or *Chou*.

**Sinking**
"Sinking" means the Sun is in the west for night births, or the Moon is in the east for day births. When governing official blessings, the body, fate, fields, wealth, or spouses and heirs, this is called "the Sun losing its configuration."

**Sequential**
"Sequential" means the Five Stars move from north to west, or from south to east, following degrees in mutual generation without discordant stars—this is auspicious. For example, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water generating in sequence is propitious.

**Reversed**
"Reversed" means the Five Stars move from north to east, or from south to west, clashing in mutual overcoming, with chaotic stars—this is inauspicious. For example, Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, and Earth clashing in conflict is ominous.

**Declining**
"Declining" refers to Earth in spring, Metal in summer, Wood in autumn, Fire in winter, and Water in the four transitional seasons. Additionally, stars in states of decline, illness, death, extinction, gestation, or nurturing are in decline. When governing stars occupy such positions, it is especially unfavorable.

**Prosperous**
"Prosperous" refers to Wood in spring, Fire in summer, Metal in autumn, Water in winter, and Earth in the four transitional seasons. Additionally, stars in states of growth, maturity, or peak power are prosperous. When governing stars occupy such positions, it is especially auspicious.

**Concealing**
"Concealing" refers to *Rāhu* and *Ketu* obscuring stars. They may conceal stars in the northwest by day or hide luminaries in the southeast by night.

**Eclipsing**
"Eclipsing" occurs when the Sun and Moon align with *Rāhu* and *Ketu*. For those born at dawn on the new moon or at night on the full moon, an eclipse occurs if *Rāhu* or *Ketu* are present. It is inauspicious for the fate or body to reside in the degrees of the Sun or Moon.

**Clashing**
"Clashing" refers to opposition and mutual overcoming. For example, Fire in *Zi* and Water in *Wu*. Or Wood in *Chou* and Metal in *Wei*—opposing and clashing, this is inauspicious. The rest can be deduced accordingly.

**Restraining**
"Restraining" means a governing star is subdued. For example, if Wood is the governing star but is restrained by Metal. Or if Earth is the governing power but is restrained by Wood. Governing stars include those of the body, fate, official blessings, fields, wealth, spouses, and heirs. Being overcome by other stars is inauspicious.

**Facing**
"Facing" means mutual orientation. For example, if stars converge in the south and the fate resides there. Or if stars face north and the fate is in the north. If *Ketu* and *Rāhu* intercept stars in the east and the fate is in the east, or intercept stars in the west and the fate is in the west—all are called "facing."

**Encompassing**
"Encompassing" means a triple conjunction. For example, the Sun and Moon encompassing the body or fate, official blessings, fields, wealth, spouses, or children. Or emolument and fortune stars encompassing the body, fate, official blessings, fields, wealth, spouses, or children. Or fields and wealth encompassing the body, fate, official blessings, spouses, or children.

**Flanking**
"Flanking" means being on both sides. For example, the Sun and Moon flanking the body, fate, official blessings, fields, wealth, spouses, or children. Or emolument and fortune stars flanking the body, fate, official blessings, fields, wealth, spouses, or children. Or fields and wealth flanking the body, fate, official blessings, spouses, or children.

**Assisting**
"Assisting" means auxiliary support. For example, the body or fate star assisting the Sun and Moon before or after. Or the official blessing star assisting the Sun and Moon on the left or right. Or fields, wealth, spouses, and heirs being lifted by the Sun and Moon—all are considered proper configurations.

**Dividing**
"Dividing" means *Rāhu* and *Ketu* intercepting stars into two paths. They may separate civil and martial stars into two groups, or divide them into civil stars in the east and martial stars in the west. They may also separate the Sun and Moon into parallel brightness or isolate official blessings into clarity and vigor.

**Convergence**
"Convergence" means all stars gathering in a single palace or degree. For instance, the Eleven Luminaries converging upon the body or fate. Or the Eleven Luminaries converging upon official blessings, or upon fields and wealth. When all stars proceed in harmony, mutually generating without conflict or contention, it is most auspicious.

**Leading**
"Leading" means preceding. A leading star should be at a distant degree. For example, the Sun and Moon leading the way, or official blessings leading, or fields and wealth leading, or spouses and heirs leading. Or the Civil Chief leading, the First-in-Scholarship leading, or official seals leading—those that occupy favorable positions are excellent.

**Following**
"Following" means trailing. A following star should be at a near degree. For instance, Metal and Water leading and following: Water should precede, Metal should follow. Wood and Fire leading and following: Fire should precede, Wood should follow. Earth and Metal leading and following: Metal should precede, Earth should follow. This is because the latter can generate the former, while the former cannot generate the latter.

**Interception**
"Interception" means *Rāhu* and *Ketu* blocking the path. They may intercept all stars in the southeast, especially for those born during the day. Or they may intercept the multitude of luminaries in the northwest, particularly for those born at night. Or, when *Rāhu* and *Ketu* divide the center, they may intercept civil stars in the east and martial stars in the west.

**Leakage**
"Leakage" means intercepting and releasing auspicious stars. For those born during the day, leakage may release the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, *Ketu*, and *Rāhu* in yang palaces and yang degrees. For those born at night, leakage may release the Moon, Mars, *Rāhu*, and Venus in yin palaces and yin degrees.

**Residence**
"Residence" means the body or fate dwelling in a palace. The palace of residence, in conjunction with the converging stars, determines nobility or baseness.

**Divergence**
"Divergence" means two paths separated by a boundary. For example, the second degree of *Wei* in *Mao*, while the third degree of *Wei* passes into *Yin*—this is a divergence where the same degree spans two palaces. Or the ninth degree of *Xu* in *Zi* and the first degree of *Wei*—this is a divergence where the same palace spans two degrees. In all cases, the body, fate, official blessings, and other stars should occupy degrees deeply, avoiding entanglement in divergent boundaries.

The above eight methods of initiation and observation form the essential framework of astrological study, serving as the model for scholars. One should ponder them carefully to grasp their essence.

*Preface to the Simplified Rites of Burial*

It is often said that the noble person does not economize for the world at the expense of their parents—how then could one not bury them with utmost generosity? Yet the earth’s hidden veins are but a single thread, the marvelous mechanism of creation itself. In this age, officials and great families often indulge in lavish adornment to dazzle the eyes of the living, even going so far as to carve and damage the true *qi* of creation—how deplorable this is!

Here, I have examined and recorded several maxims on burial rites from the ancient worthies, that benevolent and filial descendants may find guidance in them.

**On the Coffin**
Master Zhu said: Oil cedar is best, followed by *xiang* wood, then earth cedar. Its construction should be square and straight, with a broad head and narrow foot, just sufficient to contain the body—avoid making it tall or large. Do not fashion hollow eaves or high legs. Both inside and out, apply a coating of ash lacquer. On the bottom, spread a layer of charcoal powder one or two *cun* thick, then place the Seven Stars board atop it. For the mixture of *lin* rice, oil, ash, and pitch (also called pine resin, pine rosin, or "cloud incense"), nails and metal fittings are unnecessary. What follows does not reflect Master Zhu’s intent.

Hu Yong of the Hu clan said: Peng Zhitang, in his *Instructions for the Young*, stated: "Sealing with pine resin is suitable for the north; in the south, it becomes a nest for ants." Moreover, nails and metal fittings may draw moisture, causing the wood to rot more easily. Peng must have further investigated this.

Liu Zhang of the Liu clan said: Among all rites for sending off the dead, only the coffin and the *ning* (inner coffin frame) are objects intimately connected to the body—what the filial son should devote his utmost care to. On the day of mourning, when selecting wood for the coffin, one may fear that in haste the right timber cannot be found, or that the ash lacquer may not yet be firm and complete. If it is a summer month, the body cannot be kept long. In ancient times, when a ruler ascended the throne, he would prepare his *bei* (outer coffin) and *guo* (outer casket), applying a fresh coat of lacquer each year. Today, some people prepare their own "longevity vessels" while still alive—this is still following the Way, not prematurely courting misfortune. The best woods are oil cedar and *xiang* wood; do not make the coffin tall or large merely for ostentatious beauty. The coffin need only encase the body, and the *ning* need only encase the coffin’s base. Both inside and out, wrap the coffin in cloth and apply lacquer to ensure firmness and solidity.

Note: The Seven Stars board inside the coffin is made from a single plank, its length and width sufficient to fit within the coffin, with seven holes carved into it.

**On Burial**
Master Zhu said: Burial should take place within three months; beforehand, select a suitable site. Master Cheng said: "Divining the grave site is to assess the quality of the land—its goodness or badness—not what the yin-yang practitioners call fortune or misfortune. Where the land is good, the spirits rest in peace, and their descendants thrive. This is like nourishing the roots so that the branches and leaves flourish—it is only natural. Where the land is bad, the opposite occurs. How then do we define a good site? The signs are the luster of the soil and the luxuriance of the grass and trees. Father and ancestors share the same *qi* with their descendants: if the former are at peace, so are the latter; if the former are in peril, so are the latter—this too is natural. Those who are bound by taboos, deluded by the selection of directional orientations or the determination of auspicious days, are indeed rigid. Worse still are those who do not consider honoring their ancestors but focus solely on benefiting their descendants—this is not the mindset of a filial son ensuring a proper resting place. Only the Five Hazards must be carefully avoided: ensure that the site will not later become a road, a city wall, a ditch or pond, be seized by the powerful, or be encroached upon by farmers."

Another version states: "The so-called Five Hazards are ditches, roads, avoiding villages, and keeping far from wells and cellars."

Qiu Jun, Duke Wenzhuang, said: "The theories of *fengshui* (wind and water), with their hopes for great wealth and nobility, cannot be trusted. However, aligning with the *qi* of life to secure the remains of ancestors does accord with Master Yichuan’s analogy of roots, branches, and leaves. Former scholars often adopted this view. Master Zhu and Cai Jitong once pre-selected a burial site, and when the time came, his disciples carried provisions and followed the funeral procession for six days before arriving—such was their careful selection."

Master Zhu, in discussing the selection of burial sites, said one must first assess the strength of the land’s dominant *qi*, the convergence or dispersion of its winds, the depth of its soil, the alignment of the burial path, and whether its vitality is complete. Only then can the quality of the land be properly judged. Those who choose burial sites today should follow Master Zhu’s principles, incorporating Master Yichuan’s signs of luster and luxuriance, and guarding against the Five Hazards—this should suffice.

**Selecting the Day to Open the Burial Ground**
According to the *Family Rituals*, the master leads the officiants to the chosen site to dig the grave pit. The soil from the four corners is placed outside, while the soil from the center and the south is placed to the south. Erect a marker at each of the four corners outside the pit, and two markers at the southern gate. "Placing the soil from the four corners outside" means removing the soil beyond the pit’s edges. "Placing the soil from the center and south to the south" means depositing that soil to the south.

**Sacrificing to the Earth Deity**
The *Family Rituals* states: Sacrificing to the Earth Deity is to prevent presumption. Select a distant relative or a guest, who wears auspicious clothing and a plain cap, to make the announcement to the Earth Deity. The invocator leads the officiants to set up an altar to the left of the central marker, facing south. A cup is placed there, filled with wine, and dried meats and fermented grains are arranged before it. A washing basin and two hand towels are set to the east and west—one for the announcer to wash, the other for the officiants.

**Ritual Procedures**
At the altar, the announcer stands facing north, with two officiants behind. They bow twice, rise, bow twice again, then stand upright. The announcer and officiants all rise. They wash their hands: the announcer and officiants all perform the ablution. The announcer approaches the incense table and kneels. One officiant, holding the wine vessel, kneels facing west; another, holding the cup, kneels facing east. The announcer takes the vessel, pours wine into the cup, returns the vessel, and takes the cup. He pours the wine onto the ground as a libation, then refills the cup and places it before the deity’s tablet. He bows deeply, rises, and steps back slightly. The invocator, holding the prayer tablet, kneels to the announcer’s left and reads the prayer. The prayer and paper money are burned together. They bow twice, rise, bow twice again, then stand upright. The ritual is complete.

**Prayer Text**
In the such-and-such year (cyclical signs), such-and-such month (cyclical signs), on the such-and-such day (cyclical sign), so-and-so, of such-and-such office and surname, respectfully announces to the Earth Deity of this mountain: Now, for my father (state the father’s official title and name) or mother (state the mother’s surname and title), I am establishing a grave site on this mountain, facing such-and-such direction. May the deity protect and bless us, that we encounter no future hardships. With pure wine and dried meats, I reverently offer this to the deity. May you deign to accept it.

Note: Ancient rituals did not include the Earth Deity as such; only the *Kaiyuan Rituals* of the Tang Dynasty did. The *Book of Rites* by Sima Guang and the *Family Rituals* by Master Zhu both follow the *Kaiyuan Rituals* in including sacrifices to the Earth Deity when opening the burial ground, interring the coffin, and offering tomb sacrifices. The title "Earth Deity" is paired with "August Heaven." Only the state may use this term; for common families, it may seem presumptuous. However, in the *Complete Works of Master Zhu*, there is a prayer text for the Earth Deity.

Here follows the proposed revision: henceforth, "Earth Deity" shall be styled "Spirit of the Local Earth."

The ritual implements and tables are then removed, and the grave pit is excavated. *Removing* refers to clearing away the sacrificial altar and its furnishings. *Excavating the grave pit*: Sima Wengong states that modern burials employ two methods—one digs straight down to form the pit and suspends the coffin for placement; the other carves a lateral tunnel to create a side chamber where the coffin is interred. According to ancient rites, only the Son of Heaven may construct a tunnel; all others must dig straight down to form the pit and suspend the coffin for placement. This method should be followed today. The excavation ought to be narrow and deep: narrow to prevent collapse, deep to deter grave robbers. *Note*: Deep burial to prevent theft is indeed a sound principle of the former worthies. However, geomancers also speak of shallow burial to harness natural *qi* and water veins, arguing that dragon veins rise and fall, and soil depth varies. As Master Zhu observed in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, coffins buried only halfway, with earth mounded above, may encounter water if sunk too deep. Thus, burial depth cannot be uniformly prescribed. Moreover, before the Song dynasty, tombs often contained gold and treasures, inviting grave robbery. The present dynasty’s ritual codes forbid burial with gold or valuables, eliminating the threat of theft. This prohibition is most proper. In Wu region, even the deceased’s clothing is pre-cut to prevent theft. Yet true filial devotion lies in selecting an auspicious site to secure the departed, not in burying gold and jewels. Such practices do not honor the dead but invite grave robbery—a grievous folly.

**Constructing the Charcoal Barrier**
Once the pit is dug, first spread a layer of charcoal powder on the bottom, tamping it firmly to a thickness of two or three *cun*. Then lay a mixture of lime, fine sand, and yellow earth—three parts lime to one part each of the others—on top, tamping it firmly to a depth of two or three *chi*. Construct a thin wooden frame, shaped like a table, to serve as a charcoal barrier, leaving space in the center to accommodate the coffin’s walls, rising four *cun* above the coffin. Place this on the lime mixture, then fill the surrounding space with the four materials, separated by thin wooden partitions: charcoal powder on the outside, the other three on the inside. Once the base is tamped firm, gradually withdraw the partitions, adding more charcoal and lime mixture above, tamping until level with the coffin’s sides. Charcoal repels tree roots and deters moisture and termites; lime, mixed with sand, hardens, and with earth, binds tightly. Over time, it solidifies into stone, barring entry to insects, thieves, and burrowing creatures. Master Cheng said: "The ancients’ burials sought to preserve the transformed, ensuring earth did not touch the flesh. If we take such care to protect mere curios, how much more should we safeguard the remains of our kin? Yet the shallow-minded merely wish the dead to remain unseen. Others advocate hastening decomposition, ignorant of the principles of sincerity and trust. The goal is not to prevent decay but to ensure secure, airtight preservation."

**Mixing Lime and Sand**
Fill the outer coffin (*guo*) with lime and sand, lining the pit with charcoal powder. Master Zhu, in a letter to Liao Zihui, wrote: "Later refinements like wooden outer coffins sealed with pitch seem unnecessary. Instead, first lay charcoal powder on the pit’s bottom, tamping it to a thickness of two *cun*, connecting it to the previously laid layer. Once level, place the outer coffin, then fill its sides with the three materials as before." *Note*: The outer coffin is not strictly necessary. If used, a wooden or brick *guo* is best; stone *guo* should never be used. Stone generates moisture—observe how pillars grow damp before rain—and is excessively heavy. Over centuries, if it collapses, it may crush the remains, a grievous outcome. Thus, it is better omitted.

**Filling the Outer Coffin with Lime and Sand**
Fill the bottom of the *guo* and the space around the coffin (both inside and outside the *guo*) with sand and lime. Once full, add a lid, then spread more sand and lime, topped with a *cun*-thick layer of charcoal powder. Finally, fill the pit with earth. The lime and sand deter insects and burrowers; the thicker the layer, the better. *Question*: May sand and earth be mixed with lime around the coffin? Master Zhu replied: "Use pure charcoal powder outside the *guo*; inside, fill with a mixture of sand and lime." *Question*: May pure lime be used? *Answer*: "Pure lime may not harden properly; it must be mixed with sifted fine sand. Over time, the lime and sand will fuse into a solid mass." For stone *guo*, line all sides—top, bottom, and around—with charcoal powder, about seven or eight *cun* thick. This repels moisture, prevents water damage, and blocks tree roots, which turn away upon encountering charcoal. Thus, the efficacy of charcoal and lime is evident: charcoal, being inert, deters roots. *Baopuzi* states: "Charcoal buried underground remains unchanged for a thousand years." Ritual objects made of organic materials decay over time, attracting insects—hardly a consideration for the long-term welfare of the deceased. While ancient tombs contained many items, their ritual completeness often neglected practical safeguards. The essential concern is long-term preservation, ensuring earth does not touch the flesh. Other ritual details may be omitted. I once heard Master Wang of Jixi recount that a tomb using lime was later exhumed, revealing the lime had turned to stone. Charcoal powder blocks external tree roots, as observed in local reburials. Thus, the lime-sand mixture must be applied without gaps around all sides to ensure durability.

The above three passages are all from Master Zhu.

Take three parts lime, one part yellow earth, and one part fine sand, sift them evenly, then sprinkle with diluted wine using a spray pot. Tamp firmly.

**Note:** Common practice today mixes glutinous rice porridge into the three-part soil, which also bonds the materials securely—this may be used as well.

**Inscribed Tombstone:**
Use two stone slabs: one as a lid, inscribed with: *"Tomb of [Official Title] [Name]."* If the deceased held no office, inscribe: *"Tomb of Gentleman [Given Name] [Courtesy Name]."* The second slab serves as the base, inscribed with: *"[Official Title] [Taboo Name], styled [Courtesy Name], of [Prefecture] [County], son of [Father’s Taboo Name] and [Mother’s Surname] [Mother’s Title], born on [Year, Month, Day], held offices in succession [list], died on [Year, Month, Day], interred at [Village] [Hamlet] [Mountain] facing [Direction]. Married [Wife’s Surname], daughter of [Her Father’s Name]. Sons: [Names and Titles]. Daughters: married to [Husbands’ Names and Titles]. Grandsons: [Number and Names]. Granddaughters: [Number and Names]."*

For women: if the husband is alive, the lid reads: *"Tomb of [Husband’s Official Title and Name], [Her Title] née [Surname]."* If unenfeoffed, it reads: *"Tomb of [Husband’s Name]."* If widowed: *"Wife of Gentleman [Husband’s Given Name] [Courtesy Name], née [Surname]."* The base records her birth and death dates; if her title derives from her husband or children, include it—otherwise, omit.

On the day of burial, place the two stones face-to-face, bind them with iron chains, and bury them at the tomb’s front, three to four *chi* below ground level. This precaution accounts for future shifts in terrain or accidental disturbance; if the stone is uncovered first, someone may recognize the name and rebury it.

**Note:** The Fujian custom of placing this stone inside the tomb at the head of the coffin is inappropriate. The Zhejiang practice of placing it at the tomb’s front is better, though burying it three to four *chi* below ground is most proper.

**Lowering the Coffin:**
First, lay wooden beams atop the lime barrier. Use four ropes threaded through the coffin’s bottom rings (if present), lower the coffin onto the beams, then withdraw the ropes. Alternatively, fold fine cloth or raw silk to cradle the coffin’s base, lower it, and leave the cloth in place, trimming any excess. If the coffin lacks rings, loop ropes beneath it, lower it onto the beams, remove the ropes, and proceed with cloth as above.

When lowering the coffin, ensure steady force to avoid tilting or jarring. The chief mourner and brothers should wail and oversee the process. After lowering, adjust the coffin’s clothing, *ming* tablet, and funeral banner to ensure they lie flat.

**Question:** If the coffin lacks rings, removing the ropes may be difficult—hence this method. But if rings are present, why not lower the coffin directly with ropes, then switch to cloth at the beams?
**Answer:** Likely to avoid rope removal difficulties. Modern practice uses slipknots at both ends for stable lowering—this is also acceptable.

Place bricks at the tomb’s four corners to support the coffin, facilitating rope removal after lowering.

**Applying the Inner and Outer Lime Barriers:**
Measure the lime barrier’s dimensions and craft a thin board to fit snugly against the four walls. Place it atop the coffin, seal gaps with oil-lime, then add the outer barrier.

**Note:** The original method used molten pitch, poured to a thickness of three *cun* before adding the outer barrier. Today, stone slabs may replace pitch. Some modern practices layer rice porridge mixed with lime in ceramic bowls—this is also sturdy and acceptable.

**Filling with Lime:**
Spread the three-part lime mixture evenly on top, followed by a thicker layer of charcoal powder—twice the depth of the base and outer/inner coffin sides. Sprinkle with wine and tread firmly, avoiding tamping to prevent jarring the coffin. Use ample material to ensure compaction over time.

**Filling and Tamping Earth:**
Add earth in one-*chi* layers, tamping lightly to avoid disturbing the coffin. Afterward, offer sacrifices to the Earth God at the tomb’s left.

**Prayer Text:**
*"On the [Day] of the [Month], [Year], [Your Name and Title], humbly announce to the Earth God of this mountain: For [Official Title] [Name], [Posthumous Title], now laid to rest in this secluded abode, may the god protect and bless, sparing future hardship. With reverence, we offer pure libations, dried meats, and delicacies—may the god deign to accept."*

Return to your position. The announcer bows twice, then withdraws.

**Note:** Liu Zhang states: *"The deceased’s form rests here, so we honor the god to ensure peace."*

**Interring Grave Goods:**
When the earth reaches halfway, place *mingqi* (spirit objects), curtains, *bao* bundles, *shao* baskets, and jars in the side chamber.

**Note:** *Mingqi* include wooden carvings of carriages, horses, servants, and maidservants holding daily-use items—towels, bedding, etc.—miniaturized to resemble life. Officials of the fifth or sixth rank may include thirty items; seventh or eighth rank, twenty; non-court officials, fifteen; commoners, ten.

*Curtains* refer to bed canopies, mats, chairs, and tables, also miniaturized. *Bao* is a bamboo mat holding leftover sacrificial meats.

**Note:** *Yili* annotates: *"Bao* is grass; ancient *baoju* refers to this."* *Liji* annotates: *"Bao* wraps fish and meat; *ju* lines vessels for storage."*

*Shao* are five bamboo containers for the five grains.

Sima Wengong states: *"Today, small jars holding five *sheng* of each grain suffice."*

Liu Zhang states: *"The* Jili *records three* lü *vessels, like* gui*, holding millet, sorghum, and wheat—all steamed, as the gods do not consume food, but the Dao values reverence."*

**Note:** *Yili* annotates: *"Shao* are bamboo containers for food, like* gui*."*

The *Lunyu* annotates: *"Shao* are bamboo vessels holding one *dou* and two *sheng*." Three ceramic jars are used to hold wine, vinegar, and fermented sauces.

**Note:** These items are commonly called "granary and treasury." Today, they are no longer used, though in Fujian, two ceramic jars are employed—one holding the five grains, called the *granary*; the other holding copper coins or paper money, called the *treasury*. In my homeland, neither is used.

Zhang Yue states: "No jars or bottles are placed in the tomb, as they are akin to water. No feathers are placed, as they are akin to the corpse. No gold is placed, as it endures and becomes uncanny. No cinnabar, realgar, or alum are placed, as their fierce heat dries the earth, preventing it from nourishing growth. If ancient *mingqi* (spirit articles) are interred in the tomb, these objects will inevitably breed insects over time. If one insists on using them, it is better to dig a separate pit beside the burial chamber to contain them."

Sima Wengong states: "From *mingqi* downward, once the earth filling reaches halfway, a side chamber is excavated beside the burial pit to store them, its entrance sealed with a plank."

Liu Shi states: "Someone asked about the meaning of *mingqi*. The *Dangong* annotation says: 'It refers to sending off the dead with ritual, treating them with the rites due to the deceased.' To lack a heart that cherishes one’s kin is unfilial and cannot be done. To treat them with the rites of the living is to lack the clarity of principle, which is unwise and also cannot be done. Thus, objects are prepared but cannot be used. They are called *mingqi* because they are treated with the Way of the spiritually enlightened."

Someone asked: "Digging a side chamber may inconvenience the drainage of the empty burial pit. Would it be better to store them where the epitaph is buried?" The reply: "Though this reflects the ancient reluctance to treat one’s kin as truly dead, these objects are in fact useless. Moreover, dried meats decay and breed insects, attracting ants—this is especially unsuitable and should not be done. Only *mingqi* should be buried."

**Note:** Digging side chambers to bury *mingqi*—such as Fujian’s wooden carvings of golden roosters, jade dogs, cypress figures, and earth gods—may disrupt the earth’s veins and invite water, breeding insects and causing further decay. It is better to omit them entirely. If a filial descendant insists on following ritual, there is no need for intricate carvings; paper models may suffice. After the interment is complete and the earth is tamped, during the rite of thanking the earth and announcing the tomb’s completion, these paper models may be burned before the grave, following the principle of burning paper money. This is both convenient and appropriate. May this be noted by the benevolent and filial.

**Placing the Epitaph Stone**
If the tomb is on level ground, first lay a single layer of bricks in the southern part of the tomb path, place the stone atop them, surround it with bricks, and cover it. If the tomb is on a steep mountainside, dig a pit four to five *chi* deep several *chi* south of the burial chamber, bury the stone according to the method, then refill and tamp the earth firmly. The depth of the refilled earth should be about one *chi*, but it must be densely tamped and solidly packed.

**Note on Construction Methods**
Common practice employs brick vaults, which must be built tall and spacious, yet over time they inevitably collapse and sink—this is most improper. It is fitting instead to use ample *sanhetu* (three-part soil mixture) and tamp it firmly.

**Inscribing the Spirit Tablet**
The officiant arranges a table before the bier, facing left, with inkstone, brush, and ink placed to the right, and a washing basin with towel nearby.

**Ritual Procedure**
The master of ceremonies stands before the table. The invocator and the inscriber both perform ablutions.

**Presenting the Tablet**
The invocator opens the box, removes the wooden tablet, and lays it flat upon the table. After washing his hands, the inscriber stands to the right.

**Inscribing the Tablet**
The central characters of the tablet should first be written by another person, leaving only the blank surface for the final touch. For the character *zhu* (主) on the spirit tablet, omit the dot, leaving it as *wang* (王). The inscriber then adds the single dot above, completing the character *zhu*—this is called "inscribing the tablet."

**Placing the Tablet**
The invocator reverently installs the tablet upon the bier. The *hunpo* silk is then stored in the box behind the tablet.

**Offering Incense and Libations**
The invocator lights incense, pours wine, and kneels; the master of ceremonies and all others kneel as well.

**Reciting the Invocation**
The invocator reads the prayer but does not burn it.

**Concluding the Rite**
All rise and return to their positions. They bow, then perform four prostrations, rising after each. The master of ceremonies expresses gratitude to the inscriber with two bows; the inscriber responds with a single bow.

**Note on the Inscription Method**
Why are the central characters of the tablet written in advance by another, leaving only the final dot for the inscriber? It is because the one who performs the "dot inscription" is often a person of high rank or advanced age, for whom writing at the moment may be inconvenient. Thus, this is a matter of practical adaptation. The Confucian ritual classics do not address this practice.

**Form for Inscribing the Tablet**

**Inscription for the Tablet’s Central Characters**

For a father:
*"Ming gu* [Deceased with honor] So-and-so, [posthumous] official title So-and-so, personal name So-and-so, courtesy name So-and-so, seniority order [number]—spirit tablet."*

For a mother:
*"Ming gu* [Deceased with honor] Lady So-and-so of [her husband’s] noble rank So-and-so, personal name So-and-so, seniority order [number]—spirit tablet."*

For the tablet’s powdered face:
For a father:
*"Xian kao* [Illustrious deceased father] So-and-so, [posthumous] official title and honorific appellation—spirit tablet."*

For a mother:
*"Xian bi* [Illustrious deceased mother] Lady So-and-so of [her husband’s] noble rank—spirit tablet."*

On the lower left side of the tablet, inscribe:
*"Filial son So-and-so offers sacrifice."*

If the deceased held no official rank, use the title by which they were commonly known. For example, for a father:
*"Xian kao* [Illustrious deceased father] Gentleman of Leisure—spirit tablet."*

---

**Prayer Text**
*"In the year [X], cyclical year [X], month [X], first day [X], at the hour [X], orphaned son So-and-so dares to solemnly announce to [posthumous] official title and honorific appellation So-and-so: Your form has returned to the grave, your spirit to the ancestral hall. Now that the spirit tablet is complete, I humbly beseech your august soul to embrace the old and follow the new, to rely upon and abide by this tablet."*

For a mother, replace *"orphaned son"* with *"mourning son."*

*Notes on* **zhūnxī** *(窀穸):*
As recorded in *The Zuo Tradition* (*Zuo Zhuan*), Duke Xiang 13th year: When King Gong of Chu fell gravely ill, he gazed at his ministers and said, *"I shall preserve my head and limbs only to be buried in the earth."* This refers to the *Spring and Autumn* practice of interment. The commentary explains: *Zhūn* (窀), pronounced *zhānglún*, means "thick"; *xī* (穸), pronounced like *xī* (night), means "night." Thus, *zhūnxī* signifies the long night of burial.

---

**Procession with the Spirit Tablet**
The prayer is recited as the spirit tablet is placed in the carriage, with the soul banner box following behind. In modern custom, the master of the household personally cradles the tablet in his arms while riding in the sedan chair, ensuring the spirit remains close. This, too, has its rationale.

The attendants dismantle the spirit seat and proceed. The mourners follow, men on the left and women on the right, with those in heavier mourning leading and those in lighter mourning behind. Upon leaving the burial site, elders mount carriages or horses and depart, maintaining a distance of roughly a hundred paces from the grave. Younger mourners also ride carriages or horses, or boats if traveling by water. Only one junior descendant remains to oversee the completion of the grave’s earthworks.

*Query:* After the tablet is inscribed, why does the filial son carry it home, entrusting the sealing of the grave and mound to others?
*Response:* One serves the dead as one serves the living. The deceased’s remains are interred in the earth, while the spirit attaches to the tablet. Thus, the filial son prioritizes escorting the tablet to settle the spirit. The sealing of the grave and mound may be delegated to close relatives, disciples, or others. When Confucius attended a burial, he entrusted the sealing to his disciples. During a heavy rain that threatened to collapse the grave, Zigong returned late and informed Confucius, who wept bitterly and rebuked his disciples: *"In ancient times, graves were not repaired."* By this, he meant that graves were originally built sturdy and solid, requiring no later repairs—not that collapse should go unaddressed. The modern practice of returning to the grave three days later to complete the mound stems from this principle.

---

**Constructing the Grave Mound**
The mound should stand four *chi* high. As recorded in *Tan Gong* (*Book of Rites*), after Confucius was interred alongside his wife at Fang, he remarked: *"I have heard that in ancient times, graves had no mounds. But I am a wanderer from all directions—how could I not mark the site?"* Thus, he ordered a mound four *chi* high. This serves as the model.

A small stone stele is erected at the front, also four *chi* high, with a base (*fu*) approximately one *chi* tall.

Sima Wengong [Sima Guang] observed: *"According to modern regulations, the size and number of grave steles, stone beasts, and other elements vary by rank. Yet those who bury the dead should consider long-term consequences. How can future generations know whether these objects do not conceal gold or jade? They bring no benefit to the deceased and may even cause harm. The regulations further stipulate that the noble may emulate the humble, but the humble may not emulate the noble. For those with foresight, even within their rightful entitlements, it is best to reduce excess where possible."*

*Further note on Sima Wengong’s proposal:*
A separate small stele of white stone, at least one *chi* in diameter, should be erected. The rear two-thirds of the stele should be shaped like a *gui* tablet, with its face resembling the cover of a tomb inscription. On the left side, briefly record the deceased’s lineage, name, and deeds, continuing the inscription around to the right side. For women, the stele is erected only after their husband’s burial, with the face matching the cover of his tomb inscription.

*Ming dynasty regulations on burial grounds:*
- For first-rank officials: 90 *bu* (paces) of cemetery land, decreasing by 10 *bu* per rank; seventh-rank and below may not exceed 30 *bu*; commoners are limited to 9 *bu*.
- For first-rank graves: 1 *zhang* 8 *chi* high, decreasing by 2 *chi* per rank; seventh-rank and below may not exceed 6 *chi*.
- Stone steles: First-rank officials use *chī*-headed steles with tortoise bases; second-rank, *qílín*; third-rank, *tiānlù*; fourth- to seventh-rank, round-headed steles with square bases. The size of stone figures and beasts decreases proportionally by rank. The arrangement of stone figures, beasts, and pillar markers follows statutory regulations.
- The noble may emulate the humble, but the humble—regardless of wealth—may not emulate the noble. Those with foresight should, within their rightful entitlements, reduce excess where possible.

Sima Wengong further remarked: *"In ancient times, those of great merit and virtue had their names inscribed on bronze vessels and preserved in ancestral temples. Their burials included only a tall stele to lower the coffin. From the Qin and Han dynasties onward, scholars began composing eulogies to praise the deceased’s merits, carving them onto stone—hence the term 'stele.' By the Southern Dynasties, epitaphs were also buried in graves. If the deceased was truly virtuous, their fame would resound through the ages, their praises sung for eternity—how could a stele or epitaph add to their renown? If the deceased was unworthy, even the most artful words and lavish praise—claiming their merits rivaled Lü Wang’s or their virtue Confucius’s—would only invite ridicule. Who would believe it? Though a stele stands by the grave path and may be seen, an epitaph buried in the tomb remains unseen unless the grave is opened. When Emperor Wen of Sui’s four-year-old son died, his officials requested a stele. The emperor replied: 'If one seeks fame, a single volume in the historical records suffices. What need is there for a stele? It would merely serve as a weight for others.’"*

This is indeed a truthful statement. Now, since we cannot avoid following the wishes of the deceased, their epitaph should simply record their native place, family lineage, official positions, and life’s beginning and end—nothing more.

Before the tomb of Jizha stands a stone, which the world claims was inscribed by Confucius. Alas! For one such as Lord Yanling Jizi, does his virtue require many words before later generations recognize his worth? Today, it suffices to carve his name before the tomb, and people will naturally know him.

**Appendix: Epitaph for the Tomb of My Late Father**

My late father’s personal name was Song, his courtesy name Qiaonian, and his surname Zhu. He was a native of Ziyuan in Huizhou. His great-grandfather’s personal name was Zhen, his grandfather’s Xun, and both their wives were née Wang. His father’s personal name was Sen, and his mother was née Cheng. Three generations held no official posts. My father and mother were posthumously honored as *Chengshilang* and *Ruren* on account of my father.

My father was born on the *wushen* day of the intercalary second month in the fourth year of Shaosheng (1097). By nature, he was profoundly filial, possessed of lofty aspirations and great integrity, and his written words never failed to astonish. In the eighth year of Zhenghe (1118), he passed the *shangshe* examination and was appointed *Digonglang* and magistrate of Zhenghe County in Jianzhou.

When his father, *Chengshi* Gong, passed away, my father was too poor to return home, so he buried him in that county. Thereafter, he traveled for official duties in Fujian, where he first studied the teachings of *The Great Learning* and *The Doctrine of the Mean* under disciples of Yang Guishan. He was later transferred to serve as magistrate of Youxi County in Nan Jianzhou, then as tax supervisor of Shijing Town in Quanzhou, and was promoted to *Zuocongzhenglang*.

In the fourth year of Shaoxing (1134), he was summoned for an imperial examination and appointed *Zhengzi* of the Palace Library. After mourning the death of his mother, he was promoted to *Xuanjiaolang* upon audience with the emperor, then to *Zhuozuo Zuolang*, *Shangshu Du[...] Yuanwailang*, and concurrently *Jiaokan* of the Historiography Institute. He successively served in the Ministry of Personnel’s *Sikun* and *Libu* Bureaus, retaining his concurrent historiographical duties. For his service in compiling histories, he was promoted to *Zouyilang*, and for seniority, to *Chengyilang*.

Prime Ministers Zhao, the Loyal and Simple Duke, and Zhang, the Loyal and Solemn Duke, both esteemed and knew my father, but he was not employed before their departures. Qin Kuai grew resentful of him for this, and when my father led his colleagues in vehemently opposing the peace negotiations with the Rong, Qin’s anger deepened. My father was appointed prefect of Raozhou but did not assume the post. Instead, he requested to serve as *Zhuguan* of Chongdao Abbey in Taizhou. On the *xinhai* day of the third month in the thirteenth year (1143), he passed away in his lodging south of Jianzhou city at the age of forty-seven.

His writings include *The Weizhai Collection* in twelve volumes. He married the daughter of the *chushi* Que of the same prefecture, née Zhu, who was later enfeoffed as *Ruren*. She passed away twenty-seven years after him. His son, Xi, once served as *Zuodigonglang* and was assigned as compiler in the Bureau of Military Affairs. His daughter married *You Digonglang* and magistrate of Changting County, Liu Zixiang. His grandsons, Shu, Ye, and Zai, and granddaughters, Xun and Dui, were all young.

Initially, my father wished to be buried in Wufu of Chong’an. After his death, he was interred the following year beside Lingfan Abbey in his hometown. At the time, I was young and inexperienced in worldly affairs, and the divined burial site was deemed unsuitable. Fearing his remains would not rest in peace, I had him reinterred on the fifth day of the eighth month in the sixth year of Qiandao (1170) beneath Ezifeng of Baishui in our village.

I weep and lament, my grief piercing my heart and bones. Reflecting deeply, my father did not live to see his aspirations fulfilled, and I, his son, have failed to emulate his virtues—it seems I cannot honor him even to a fraction of his worth. I dare only record his surname, lineage, official positions, and the outline of his ambitions. Carving this and burying it in the dark, I shall also request an inscription to mark his tomb. The boundless grace of Heaven—alas, my sorrow!
