# 太上洞玄灵宝五显观华光本行妙经

**The Marvelous Scripture of the Original Conduct of Hua Guang, the Five Manifestations of Lingguan from the Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure**

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Original Commencement, during the dawn of the Crimson Clarity Kalpa, resided in the Jade Purity Sagely Realm of the Clear Tenuity Heaven within the Great Brahma Heaven. Seated upon the Ninefold Dragon-Phoenix Throne in the Palace of Ninefold Primordial Yang Radiance, he was accompanied by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord, the Supreme Elder Lord of Mysterious Origin, and the Divine Sovereigns of all Heavens. Nine-tiered numinous banners and feathered canopies draped around them, while jade lads and maidens scattered celestial incense and precious blossoms, suffusing the ten directions.

Then, nine phoenixes sang in unison, eight simurghs cried in harmony, celestial music resounded spontaneously, and numinous phoenixes gathered in mist. Lions and white cranes roared and chanted in melodious chorus, the heavens free of defilement, mountains veiled in clouds.

The Celestial Venerable of Original Commencement manifested his divine and wondrous power, casting nine-colored auspicious radiance. The Mysterious Capital of the Celestial Palace shone resplendently, its light descending to illumine the boundless worlds of the ten directions, all assuming a single aspect—clear as lapis lazuli, penetrating without obstruction, distinct within and without.

The Flying Heavenly Divine Kings and Supreme Great Spirits of the ten boundless directions assembled as one. Then, the Azure Emperor of the Nine Qi of the East, with his innumerable attendant perfected numinous officials, arrived floating through the void. The Vermilion Emperor of the Three Qi of the South, with his innumerable attendant perfected numinous officials, arrived floating through the void. The White Emperor of the Seven Qi of the West, with his innumerable attendant perfected numinous officials, arrived floating through the void. The Black Emperor of the Five Qi of the North, with his innumerable attendant perfected numinous officials, arrived floating through the void. The Yellow Emperor of the One Qi of the Center, with his innumerable attendant perfected numinous officials, arrived floating through the void.

Gathering at the Dharma assembly, they bowed in reverence and listened as the Celestial Venerable of Original Commencement expounded the wondrous Dharma of the Supreme Mysterious Primordial True One. The divine immortals of all heavens circumambulated in void-stepping procession, while the three realms’ attendants joined in unison to praise and chant.

At this moment, joy and celebration were beyond words. The gates of darkness opened anew, all receiving illumination. The suffering souls of the netherworld were liberated in that instant.

Then, from the assembly emerged the Perfected of Longevity and Salvation, the Perfected of Myriad Blessings and Love for Life, and the Perfected of Compassionate Universal Salvation. Adjusting their sashes and holding tablets, they bowed and addressed the Celestial Venerable:

“O Celestial Venerable of Great Compassion, Celestial Venerable of Great Sagacity, who first opened heaven and earth, who governs the revolutions of yin and yang, teacher of all numinous beings, father of all living creatures—we, by virtue of past karmic blessings, have been privileged to attend upon the Perfected. Though unworthy, we stand among the ranks of the true. Today, we have been granted the fortune to join this grand assembly, to reverently listen to the Dharma’s sound, to expound the profound mystery, and to receive enlightenment—an immeasurable grace.

We have observed that in the world below, demonic spirits run rampant, harming the people. The three disasters arise in competition, the five poisons spread unchecked, and calamities of flood, fire, blade, and warfare, along with famine and plague, cause countless deaths. This is most pitiable. We know not by what karmic causes they suffer such afflictions.

We humbly beseech the Celestial Venerable, whose benevolence and kindness extend to all, to open the gate of vast deliverance and broadly bestow the transformation of compassion.”

The Celestial Venerable replied: “Compose your thoughts and concentrate your sincerity. I shall expound for you the karmic causes of good and evil.”

After a long pause, he continued: “In the Upper Kalpa, people were simple and unadorned, their bodies one with heaven and earth. They cultivated only the Dao, teaching and transforming living beings to return to the true path. Unmoved by external things, their minds were expansive and their forms at ease. Unharmed, they fulfilled their allotted lifespans.

The people of the Middle Kalpa were endowed with humility, harmony, and generosity. They practiced the virtues of kindness, benevolence, warmth, and goodness, aiding orphans and widows, relieving the hungry and poor. They placed others before themselves and diligently performed acts of convenience.

The people of the Lower Kalpa, born into the world, persist in evil without repentance, neglecting virtuous conduct. The Dao and virtue have long been abandoned; benevolence and righteousness are no longer practiced. They disrespect heaven and earth, pay no reverence to the Three Luminaries, fear no divine spirits, are unfilial to parents, disloyal to rulers, and unmindful of their teachers. They follow perverse views, forget their origins, harm beings, deceive their own hearts, and betray the Dao. Greedy and insatiable, they accumulate evil and incur transgressions, indulging the six senses without restraint.

The Youths of Good and Evil, the Four Upright Merit Recorders, and the Investigating Messengers record their sins and report them day and night to the celestial court. Thus, the Three Officials wield their brushes, the Five Emperors examine the records, erasing names from the Azure Register and inscribing them in the Black Book. Thereupon, the Directors of Destiny, Records, Merit, and Execution reduce their allotted years and lifespans.

Some, while still alive, suffer prolonged misfortune due to perverse intentions, thwarted plans, and endless frustrations. Epidemics spread, causing many premature deaths. Others, after their lives have ended, sink into the Nine Dark Hells of the Underworld, devoid of virtuous thoughts, unable to escape the gates of darkness. All these karmic causes arise from the mind.”

Upon hearing these words, the perfected ones were filled with sorrow and compassion. Bowing again, they addressed the Celestial Venerable: “We wish to rely upon the power of your compassionate majesty and radiance, to divide our bodies and descend into the human realm to save living beings. May men and women dwell in peace, free from perverse misfortune, enjoying wealth, honor, and longevity, untouched by calamity. May demonic spirits vanish in concealment, the Dao’s transformation daily manifest, rulers be enlightened and ministers virtuous, the nation’s destiny endure, weapons be laid aside, the world know peace, the seasons harmonious, the years abundant, and all people delight in their livelihoods. We humbly implore the Celestial Venerable to grant this aspiration.”

The Celestial Venerable replied: “You now wish to benefit the living beings of the latter age, raising timely questions and making such vows—excellent, excellent! All things are born of me; all spirits are transformed by me. To save living beings is indeed as it should be. Yet there is no need for your true and ardent efforts. Compose your thoughts and hold this in your hearts. I shall now expound for you the gate of benefiting and saving living beings.”

The Celestial Venerable said: “Within the Three Heavens’ realms dwell the Divine Officials and Great Saints, the Five Celestial Marshals of Splendent Radiance. They have made vast and solemn vows to save and deliver living beings, subdue and tame the hordes of demons, and propagate the transformations of the Dao. Their majesty and numinous power blaze forth, their merit and virtue towering high. They unite with the Dao in truth, delivering countless souls. Responding to cries for aid, they hasten to succor the distressed and sustain the failing. No prayer goes unanswered; they prolong life and bestow blessings.

At times they manifest as a single body, at others they display five aspects. They may transform into the Heavenly Emperors of the various heavens, or into the bodies of Brahmā Kings. They may appear as the Auspicious Tathāgata, or as the Lord of Sun and Dew, or as the Bodhisattva of Splendent Radiance, or as the Heavenly Soldiers and Mightiest Warriors, or as the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct. Through these manifold divine powers, they adapt to circumstances and convert and deliver living beings.”

The Perfected One further inquired: “By what karmic conditions do these Divine Observers and Great Saints hold the rank of Celestial Marshals and manifest the wondrous forms of their divine powers in the ten directions?”

The Celestial Venerable replied: “These Five Celestial Marshals of the Divine Observer are endowed with the essence of the Five Stars and the qi of the Five Phases. They nurture the finest spirits of the Five Directions, transform their bodies throughout the Three Realms, and respond and appear in the ten directions. They hold authority over the weal and woe of the Three Realms and wield the handle of life and death for all things. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—all are shaped by their molding. Should anyone but once invoke their names, saying, ‘Divine Observer, Great Saint, Celestial Lord Hua Guang of Vast Transformation,’ know that their divine powers will instantly manifest, fulfilling the heart’s desire as surely as a shadow follows form or an echo answers sound. The response is luminous and unfailing, beyond all measure.”

The Perfected One again inquired: “Reverently considering the Celestial Venerable’s virtue of cherishing life, whose blessings extend to the Three Paths and whose grace moistens the ten thousand kinds, who bestows fortune upon gods and humans and serves as the bridge for delivering people, who opens the path to returning to truth—we humbly beseech you to issue a sacred decree, dispatching them to the human realm to bless the nation and pacify the people, and to proclaim the mysterious transformations.”

Thereupon, the Celestial Venerable inscribed golden tablets and jade talismans, sending the Golden Youths and Jade Maidens to summon the Five Celestial Marshals of the Divine Observer. In an instant, the Five Celestial Marshals of the Divine Observer arrived reverently at the Dharma assembly, kneeling long before the Dao.

They addressed the Celestial Venerable, saying: “We, your servants, have been nurtured by your life-giving grace and unworthily occupy the ranks of the Perfected. Today, on this great and joyous occasion, we have been specially summoned by decree and have come to this jeweled pavilion, where we gaze upon your celestial countenance and listen to the proclamation of the wondrous Dharma.”

The Celestial Venerable said: “Among the men and women of the world, many do not revere the true transformations. They commit evil and do not repent, taking deceit as their fundamental nature and greed as their conduct. They indulge their passions and desires, turning their backs on the true and inclining toward the perverse. They accumulate all manner of karmic roots of sin, unaware of the need for repentance. This causes the earth spirits to report their deeds, the heavenly statutes to condemn and punish them, summoning misfortune and inviting calamity. Grievances and enmities become entangled, and retribution is manifest, not a hair’s breadth amiss.

Moreover, there are the ghostly soldiers of those who fell in battle, the demonic and perverse beings of the lower paths, who lie in wait for gaps in human defenses. They seize people’s lifespans, pursue their souls, and seize their essence and qi, joining with their demonic cohorts to harm the good and innocent. Some die before their time is due, while others suffer plagues that afflict entire households. Looking down upon these beings, one can only feel pity and compassion.

You should descend to the human realm, dividing your bodies and transforming your qi, responding and appearing in the ten directions to gather and subdue the hordes of demons, guiding them to return to the true Dao. Thus, may the people of the lower realm be delivered from all afflictions and calamities. May their living families and dependents all attain peace and security, and may their departed ancestors and kin all be delivered and uplifted.”

At that time, the Celestial Venerable pronounced the Divine Observer Mantra:

Primal Ancestor of the Mysterious,
Three qi intermingling.
Illuminating the Three Luminaries,
Atop stands Heaven and Earth.
Preserving and regulating the kalpas,
Ensuring the heavens endure long.
The Lord Emperors of the Three Heavens,
Highest Perfected of the Supreme.
Cultivating truth and propagating the teachings,
Benefiting beings and aiding people.
Harmonizing and regulating the primal transformations,
Blessing the nation and pacifying the people.
Divine Official, Great Saint,
Celestial Lord of Splendent Radiance.
Divine powers boundless,
Assisting the Celestial Throne on high.
Dividing bodies and transforming qi,
Patrolling the Three Realms.
Aiding the living and delivering the dead,
Blessing the good and punishing the licentious.
Averting calamities and delivering from distress,
Repelling poisons and dispelling fevers.
Proclaiming commands far and wide,
Commanding the thunder gods.
Wielding a golden spear,
Treading upon wheels of fire.
Fire gourds and fire crows,
Flying flames and shooting stars.
Golden bricks in myriad layers,
Thunder and fire gleaming.
A single glance from the Heavenly Eye,
All in the Three Realms bow in reverence.
With the wind at their backs for a thousand miles,
Good and evil alike are heard.
The Six Dings and Six Jias,
The Generals of Three and Five.
Lord Thunder and Mother Lightning,
Hurling fire and molten metal.
Master Wind and Master Rain,
Spreading rain and raising clouds.
Heavenly Soldiers and Mightiest Warriors,
Their retinues in splendid array.
Sealing mountains and breaking caves,
Slaying and annihilating demonic hordes.
Demon spirits utterly subdued,
Hiding their traces by the sea’s edge.
Should any dare resist,
Their souls and spirits shall be seized.
Golden hammers shatter brains,
Iron halberds pierce hearts.
The great axe that cleaves Heaven,
Severing their bodies.
A single sweep of the Black Wind,
Reducing them to fine dust.
The Earthly Deities of the Nine Provinces,
Guests who partake of blood sacrifices,
The City God and his attendants,
Hear our commands and directives.
Assist the mysterious teachings,
Accumulating extraordinary merit.
The Jade Script of the Primal Beginning,
The Eight Mighty Dragon Scripts.
Proclaimed throughout the Three Realms,
All spirits everywhere comply.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!”

The Celestial Worthy then addressed the Perfected One, saying: “In the world, among men and women, there may be demonic spirits—*wangliang*, mountain *xiaos*, tree-dwelling *ke*, ancient vessels harboring lingering corpses, earthbound specters, stone essences, water veins teeming with malevolent *mei*, and other unorthodox deities. These entities alter their forms and essences, hurl bricks and set fires, seize human souls, and occupy dwellings, manifesting in a hundred guises to harass and disturb living beings.

Whenever such afflictions arise, devout men and women should swiftly purify themselves with fasting, ablutions, and ritual bathing. Whether at an ancient Daoist abbey or a sacred altar, or within the purity of their own homes, they should establish the precious thrones of the Three Clarities and the numinous altars of the Five Emperors. They must light incense, kindle lamps, offer flowers and libations of water, present sincere petitions, bow in reverence, and submit memorials. They should take refuge in the lofty Perfected Ones, the numinous officials, and the great sages of the Three Realms, recite the true scriptures, chant divine incantations, confess their transgressions, seek forgiveness, and pray for blessings and longevity.

The Great Sage of Numinous Observation will respond at once, leading the Five Hundred Great Sages of Numinous Observation—wielding golden bricks and golden spears, fire ladles and fire chariots, the Fire Crow Generals, the Faceless Great General, the White Snake Great General, the Thousand-Mile Favorable Wind Messenger, the thunder gods and celestial generals of the Five Directions, the bronze-headed and iron-faced officers of the Six Heavens, and the hosts of the Fire Department. They will cast molten metal, hurl fire, unleash lightning and thunder, and descend in unison to sweep away demonic miasmas, expel inauspicious omens, purify the realm, separate humans from ghosts, and restore peace to the people.

The Marshal of Numinous Observation and the mighty divine officers are beyond measure in their power. All who witness or hear of them should show utmost reverence.

Should the world suffer from excessive yang turning to pestilence, or accumulated yin festering into plague; should the Fire Deity Zhu Rong fan disaster, or rivers and seas overflow their bounds; should warfare erupt and people be displaced, or locusts swarm to devour crops—whenever such calamities arise, one must perform rites to offer thanks to Heaven and Earth, recite the true scriptures, take refuge in the Supreme Mystery, and pray for grace and blessings. Thus shall the land be pacified, winds harmonized, rains timely, all things flourish, and rivers and seas be serene.

Moreover, if mortals suffer from celestial bodies in conflict, their fortunes waning or imprisoned; if illness lingers with no path to relief; if ancestral tombs or homes offend the Earth Sovereign; if legal entanglements or unjust imprisonment persist; if epidemics spread and people languish; if rivers and seas churn with perilous waves; if wild beasts surge through mountains and forests; if spouses are separated by fate and descendants few; if journeys by land or water encounter wicked men; if curses and oppression afflict one’s kin; if a woman with child struggles in labor; if one lives in poverty with all endeavors thwarted; if households stagnate and livestock fail to thrive; if moving or felling trees scatters wealth; or if lawsuits and spectral cries entangle the departed—all such misfortunes stem from the deep accumulation of evil, bringing disaster while blessings rarely descend.

Yet if one follows the rites, practices the Dao with wholehearted sincerity, bares one’s heart in repentance, and takes refuge in the Three Treasures, peace shall be restored. Divine guardians will protect the home, the Dao’s qi will nurture and support, and all calamities shall dissipate at once.

Furthermore, if men and women, moved by filial devotion for their departed ancestors, parents, or kin, seek to deliver them, their pious thoughts shall reach the spirits, freeing them from the dark prisons of the underworld to roam in joy, forever released from suffering, and ascend to the celestial realms. The merit of this scripture is inconceivable, bestowing boundless blessings upon both the living and the dead.”

Upon hearing these words, the Perfected One vowed to propagate them, extolling the Great Sage of Numinous Observation with this hymn of praise:

“In the Supreme Great Tenuity,
The Mysterious Void abides.
Five forms perfected in wonder,
Myriad dharmas rare among mortals.
Manifesting through the Three Realms,
Appearing in the Ten Directions.
In harmony with the natural Dao,
The land is at peace, the people prosper.”

After this hymn was recited, the assembly of Perfected Ones, the countless immortals and sages, all voiced their approval.

The Celestial Worthy then addressed the Perfected One again: “Men and women of the world who follow my teachings with devotion possess profound Dao-heart and karmic affinity from past lives. By venerating and making offerings, they shall be untouched by the ten thousand calamities, blessed with good fortune, their wishes fulfilled, all virtues descending, and no evils arising.

If they further observe the four seasons, the eight solar terms, the Three Primes, the Three Assemblies, the Five La Festivals, the Ten Straight Days, the *jiazi* and *gengshen* days, the first of the month, and their own birthdays—all these auspicious times—and uphold the precepts with diligence, they shall naturally align with the myriad truths. Their fortune and longevity shall extend, their seven generations of ancestors and nine lineages of kin shall all attain liberation. If they also transmit these teachings to others, inspiring reverence and recitation, their blessings shall be boundless.

The merit of this scripture and its karmic rewards are luminously evident, beyond all conception.”

After the Celestial Worthy had spoken this scripture, the Great Sage of Numinous Observation respectfully received the divine decree and descended to the mortal realm to widely propagate the mysterious transformation. The Perfected Ones and countless immortals of the Ten Directions praised and rejoiced, bowing in reverence to the Most High, the Boundless August One, the True Three Treasures. They paid their respects and withdrew, dutifully transmitting the divine command for posterity.

Here ends *The Wondrous Scripture of the Five Manifestations of Numinous Observation and the Radiant Flower of Hua Guang’s Original Conduct from the Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure*.
