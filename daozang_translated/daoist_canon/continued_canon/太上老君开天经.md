**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on the Opening of Heaven* (abbreviated as *The Opening of Heaven Scripture*). The original text does not specify an author, but it likely emerged during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Tang dynasty monk Mingchai’s *Memorial on the Decision to Suppress Buddhist Monks and Abolish Buddhism* states that *The Opening of Heaven Scripture* was composed by Zhang Fu—this likely refers to the present text. It comprises one scroll.

**The Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao on the Opening of Heaven**

It is heard that before the existence of Heaven and Earth, beyond the Great Clarity, beyond reckoning or measure, within the boundless Void, there was utter stillness and formlessness. No Heaven, no Earth; no yin, no yang; no sun, no moon; no radiance, no light; no east, no west; no blue, no yellow; no south, no north; no softness, no hardness; no covering, no bearing; no decay, no concealment; no worthies, no sages; no loyalty, no goodness; no going, no coming; no birth, no death; no before, no after; no roundness, no squareness. A hundred million transformations, vast and boundless, without form or image, naturally empty and mysterious—inexhaustible, immeasurable, without height or depth, without equal or bias, without left or right, high and low in natural harmony.

Only I, Lord Lao, dwelled beyond the empty mystery and stillness, within the profound Void. Though unseen and unheard, if one speaks of existence, no form is visible; if one speaks of nonexistence, the myriad things arise from it. Beyond the eight directions, gradual differentiation began, descending into subtlety to form the world, giving rise to the Hongyuan.

During the Hongyuan, Heaven and Earth had not yet taken shape. The Void remained undivided, and the clear and turbid were yet unseparated, existing within the profound stillness. The Hongyuan endured for ten thousand kalpas. When the Hongyuan ended, the Hunyuan began. The Hunyuan endured for ten thousand kalpas, culminating in a hundred completions—each completion spanning eighty-one myriad years—before the Taihu arose.

In the Taihu, Lord Lao descended from the Void to become the teacher of the Taihu. From his mouth issued *The Scripture on the Opening of Heaven*, comprising 480,000 scrolls, each containing 480,000 characters, with each character spanning a hundred *li*. With this, he instructed the Taihu.

The Taihu began to distinguish Heaven and Earth, separating the clear from the turbid. The primordial chaos took shape, establishing forms and images, solidifying north and south, regulating east and west, revealing brightness, illuminating the four directions and the realms above and below, within and without, long and short, coarse and fine, male and female, black and white, great and small, noble and base—all as if wandering in darkness.

Having received this scripture from Lord Lao on the opening of Heaven, the clear and turbid were now divided: the clear *qi* ascended to form Heaven, while the turbid *qi* descended to form Earth. The Three Principles were established, and from this, Heaven and Earth came into being. Yet the sun and moon did not yet exist. When Heaven desired to transform things but found no means to do so, it placed the sun and moon within, illuminating the darkness below.

Though the Taihu had sun and moon, there were no people. Gradually, life began to emerge: above, it drew the essence of Heaven; below, the essence of Earth; and in the middle, these harmonized to form a spirit—called *human*. Heaven and Earth being empty, the Three Powers began to take shape. All living things, though formless in appearance, each received a single *qi* to come into being. Some arose from the *qi* of stillness—such as mountains and stones; some from the *qi* of movement—such as birds and beasts; and some from the *qi* of essence—such as humans. Among the myriad things, humans were the most noble.

The Taihu endured for ten thousand kalpas. The first people emerged during this time, hence it was called the Taihu. At this stage, there were only Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, and people—yet no names or knowledge existed.

When the Taihu ended, the Taishi began. During the Taishi, Lord Lao descended to become its teacher. From his mouth issued *The Scripture of the Taishi*, with which he instructed the Taishi, establishing ninety-one kalpas for the world. These ninety-one kalpas culminated in a hundred completions—each completion spanning eighty-one myriad years.

The Taishi marked the beginning of the myriad things, hence it was called the Taishi. Through circulation and refinement, images appeared within, and *qi* became visible. From this transformation, yin and yang took form.

When the Taishi ended, the Taisu began. During the Taisu, Lord Lao descended to become its teacher, instructing the Taisu in the ways of governing the world. It endured for eighty-one kalpas, culminating in a hundred completions—each completion spanning eighty-one myriad years.

The Taisu was the essence of the myriad things, hence it was called the Taisu. From the Taihu onward to the Taisu, Heaven produced sweet dew, and Earth yielded sweet springs. The people consumed them and attained longevity. Death came without burial; corpses were abandoned in distant wilds—this was called the High Antiquity.

When the Taisu ended, the Hundun began. During the Hundun, mountains and rivers first appeared. Lord Lao descended to become its teacher, instructing the Hundun in governing the world for seventy-two kalpas. As the Hundun flowed and transformed, mountains and rivers took shape—the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, with their heights and depths, noble and base—all began at this time.

From the Hundun onward, names and knowledge emerged. The Hundun gave birth to two sons: the elder, Hu Chen, and the younger, Hu Ling. When Hu Chen died, he became the spirit of mountains and peaks; when Hu Ling died, he became the spirit of waters. Thus, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways were named, and the heights and depths of mountains and rivers were established. When the Hundun ended, the Nine Palaces arose.

During the Nine Palaces, Lord Lao descended to become its teacher. From his mouth issued *The Scripture of Qian and Kun*, with which he structured the Nine Palaces, imparting names to Heaven and Earth. The clear *qi* became Heaven, and the turbid *qi* became Earth. From the Nine Palaces onward, Heaven was yang, and Earth was yin. Yang was firm and strong, difficult to perceive from afar. In Heaven, it formed images—such as the sun, moon, and stars; on Earth, it formed shapes—such as the Five Peaks and Four Waterways; in humans, it gave rise to life—such as the heart, liver, and five viscera. Though their names differed, in essence, they were one.

After the Nine Palaces ended, the Primordial Sovereign arose. During the reign of the Primordial Sovereign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, issuing from his mouth *The Scripture of the Primordial Sovereign*. He instructed the Primordial Sovereign in governing the world, and from that time onward, imperial transformation began to flow through later generations, gradually taking form.

After the Primordial Sovereign came the Supreme Sovereign. During the reign of the Supreme Sovereign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, instructing him in the governance of the world. After the Supreme Sovereign came the Earthly Sovereign, then the Human Sovereign, followed by Zunlu, Julou, Hexu, and Tailian. From Tailian backward to the time of Hundun was called the Middle Antiquity. In that era, Heaven produced the Five Blacks, and Earth yielded the Five Flavors. The people consumed them and thus prolonged their years.

After Tailian came Fuxi, born at the origin of the One Source, succeeding Heaven in birth. He harmonized and practiced yin and yang, establishing the Eight Trigrams. Before Fuxi, the Five Classics did not record, and written texts did not transmit. Only Lord Lao, from the boundless emptiness beyond the Great Clarity—numberless as the sands of the Ganges—had existed. Since the Dao divided and Heaven and Earth came into being, he established imperial transformation, aiding the Heavenly Thearch and transmitting it to later generations, recording it himself.

During Fuxi’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as the Master of Non-Transformation, also called Master Yuhua. He taught Fuxi to extend the old methods, expound yin and yang, rectify the eight directions, and establish the Eight Trigrams, composing *The Scripture of Primordial Yang* to instruct him. Before Fuxi, there were no surnames or given names, only personal names. At that time, the people were simple and honest, without the Five Grains. Fuxi taught them to cast nets and snares to capture birds and beasts for food. They clothed themselves in fur and drank blood, their diet rank and foul. Men and women made no distinctions, bore no jealousy or resentment. In winter, they dwelled in caves; in summer, they nested in trees.

After Fuxi came Nüwa. After Nüwa came Shennong. During Shennong’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Dacheng. He composed *The Scripture of the Great Subtlety* to teach Shennong to taste the hundred herbs, obtain the Five Grains, and plant them for the people to consume, thus replacing the lives of birds and beasts.

After Shennong came Suiren. During Suiren’s time, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, instructing him to drill wood to produce fire, continuing the light of the sun, transforming raw into cooked, and eliminating rankness and foulness.

After Suiren came Zhurong. During Zhurong’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Guangshou. He taught the cultivation of the Three Bonds, the regulation of the Seven Governances, and the practice of the Dao by the Three Sovereigns, so that all people were free from illness. He composed *The Scripture of Massage and Qi Circulation*.

Next came three generations: Gaoyuan, Gaoyang, and Gaoxin. Then came Cangjie and Zhongshuo, who taught writing and literature.

After the Three Sovereigns came the Yellow Thearch, Xuanyuan. During the Yellow Thearch’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Guangcheng. He regulated yin and yang, composing *The Scripture of Daoist Precepts* and *The Scripture of the Dao*. From the Yellow Thearch onward, distinctions arose between ruler and subject, father and son, noble and base.

After the Yellow Thearch came Shaohao. During Shaohao’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Suiying. He composed *The Scripture of the Mysterious Treasury*. At that time, the world was at peace: auspicious grain grew, sweet springs flowed, qilin appeared, phoenixes arrived, and propitious stars shone.

After Shaohao came Emperor Zhuanxu. During Zhuanxu’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Chijing. He composed *The Scripture of Subtle Words*.

After Zhuanxu came Emperor Ku. After Emperor Ku came Emperor Yao. During Emperor Yao’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Wucheng. He composed *The Scripture of Governance*.

After Emperor Yao came Emperor Shun. During Emperor Shun’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Yinshou. He composed *The Scripture of the Great Clarity*.

After Emperor Shun came Yu of Xia. During Yu’s reign, Lord Lao descended to become his teacher, known as Master Zhenxing. He composed *The Scripture of Virtue and Sincerity*.

After Yu came Tang of Yin. After Tang came the beginning of Zhou. During the early Zhou, Lord Lao descended to become the teacher, known as Master Xieyi. He composed *The Scripture of Red Essence*.

Lord Lao said: "At the beginning of secret transformation, my form was emptiness and nothingness. I passed through endless eons, undergoing myriad transformations. First descending to become the teacher, before the Three Sovereigns, I was the root of divine transformation. Thereafter, I transformed to become the teacher of the Three Sovereigns and Five Thearchs, as well as the Three Kings, all of whom I exhorted to cultivate goodness.

Heaven is one, Earth two, humans three, seasons four, sounds five, pitch pipes six, stars seven, winds eight, and provinces nine—together they number forty-five. Zi, Mao, and You.

At the center, each has nine calculations: wearing nine and treading one, three on the left and seven on the right, two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet, with five at the center like a tortoise. The body forms the Eight Trigrams.

Water flows to its end, dividing eight to reach Chou. Leaves fall to return to their root, dividing six to reach Hai. Metal and wood are strong in their essence, dividing two to reach Wei. Earth reigns in the four seasons, dividing four to reach Ji. Kan laments its solitary course, Li’s brightness numbers four. Gen’s eight are lofty and scattered. Three follow Kun’s position. Qian faces Kun, pursuing the one. Xun sighs at the Gate of Heaven, borrowing one from Qian. Zhen’s thunder shakes the marsh, reduced by Dui. Chen, Wu, You, and Hai are the trigrams of self-formed images, each containing its eight. When the trigrams are complete, the remaining nine counting rods form the character *yi* (change).

Lord Lao then expounded the method of the Moving Cycle and its guard: "The method of the Moving Cycle has its own guard. First, raise Kan [one] to join Kun [two]. In the southwest is the Queen Mother of the West; in the east, the Azure Dragon. Cultivate *qi* to send forth its descendants, inquiring at the Earthly Gate. Xun’s four cycles enter the Central Palace, then emerge from the Central Palace to ascend to Qian. In the west lies the Great Marsh, the peak of Mount Hua. In the northeast, inquire at Yin and Gen. In the south, the fiery blaze of Li and Mount Huo. Suddenly transforming, enter the mystery in the north."
