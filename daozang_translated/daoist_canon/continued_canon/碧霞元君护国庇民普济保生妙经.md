**The Marvelous Scripture of the Azure Cloud Primordial Sovereign for Protecting the Nation, Sheltering the People, and Universally Saving and Preserving Life**

**Opening Gatha:**
The Heavenly Immortals of Great Compassion,
From the kalpa’s dawn attained the Supreme Perfected.
Manifesting forms to rescue the suffering,
They vowed to deliver gods and humans alike.
Disasters and blessings discern good and evil,
Fortune and woe respond to primordial causes.
The armies of the Five Peaks all submit to Her,
Saving the manifest, delivering the hidden and sunken.
With devotion, none goes unanswered;
Sincere thought brings immediate resonance.
With wholehearted prayer for blessings and protection,
We take refuge and bow to the True Scripture.

**The Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounds *The Marvelous Scripture of the Azure Cloud Primordial Sovereign for Protecting the Nation, Sheltering the People, and Universally Saving and Preserving Life***

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy ascended to the Supreme Azure Realm, mounting the spontaneous Hundred-Treasure Dharma Throne of Jasper Jade Terrace, to expound the wondrous transformations of the Supreme Mystery of the Primordial Dao to the assembled perfected beings.

Then, the radiance of the Heavenly Worthy illuminated the ten thousand heavens, and celestial music resounded of itself. Heavenly flowers filled the expanse, and rare fragrances wafted through the air. The myriad heavens and emperors, the hosts of immortals of the Three Realms, gathered beneath the terrace. Having completed their obeisance, they encircled the throne, listening reverently to the exposition of the Dao.

At that moment, the Five Peaks offered flowers, and the Four Waterways presented treasures. From the assembled ranks, a perfected one named Yuluo stepped forth, knelt upright, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "By what past affinity have I, your servant, been granted the fortune to attend Your Jade Steps? I have been blessed to hear the Supreme Dao, and my heart is deeply indebted to Your boundless compassion. Yet in the governance of transformation, my humble understanding remains unenlightened."

Beneath the mortal realm, the people undergo endless cycles of birth and transformation, each governed by divine overseers who record the destinies of heaven and humanity. All this falls under the jurisdiction of the Azure Radiance Primordial Sovereign of the Eastern Peak, who also presides over Mount Tai. By what karmic affinity has she attained her sacred rank? I humbly seek the cause of this Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent is this question. Return to your place, and I shall expound for you.

When heaven and earth were first divided, the Five Peaks stood in their directions, and the myriad things came to life in spring—all transformations began in the east. The Eastern Peak records births and harmonizes the primordial workings. In high antiquity, people were endowed with upright natures, fully embodying loyalty and filial piety. They lived long lives, and upon death, passed directly to rebirth, free from transgression or offense, never descending into darkness, never losing their original purity, and ever ascending to the good Dao.

In this degenerate age, people have strayed from the ancient Way, their hearts turning to cunning and deceit. They are disloyal to their rulers, unfilial to their parents, disrespectful to their teachers and elders, and unkind to their brothers. They rely on strength to bully the weak and recklessly engage in strife and plunder. They commit murder, theft, and lewdness, profane the Three Luminaries, and show no fear of the gods. Even among women, few understand the karmic causes of their past lives. Having received such a body and life in this existence, they fail to repent or awaken, instead giving rise to greed and wrath. They covet wealth and despise poverty, resenting heaven and cursing earth. They insult and defy their parents-in-law, humiliate their sisters-in-law, act without compassion, and mistreat their children. They worship false gods and secretly cast curses. For such manifold evils, retribution never ceases.

At that time, the Primordial Sovereign had already attained the rank of Supreme Unity and Azure Mystery. Witnessing the suffering of sentient beings, her boundless compassion knew no end. To transform women and universally deliver all beings, on the eighteenth day of the fourth month, she divided her perfected qi and manifested her merciful countenance. Ascending and descending Mount Tai, she dwelled in the highest realm, refining her primordial essence through eons of cultivation. Her compassionate radiance penetrated all, illuminating even the most subtle and obscure. Responding to the nine qi, she gave life without end; embodying the One Primordial, she transformed without cease. Her divine power was unfathomable, her vast virtue immeasurable. Her grace extended to all under heaven, and the entire world turned in reverence. By decree of the Jade Emperor, she was confirmed as a celestial immortal, commanding the divine soldiers of the Peak’s court, inspecting the good and evil, sin and fortune of the human world, where retribution and response swiftly manifest."

The perfected one bowed deeply and asked: "How can the deceitful and cunning, who speak one way while thinking another, be discerned?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The primordial spirit of humans is endowed by heaven. When good or evil first arises, the divine luminaries already perceive it. Though hidden in seclusion, the heart’s traces are revealed. A single good thought shines forth like the reflection of light—though unseen by people, the gods have already witnessed it. There are gods who record good deeds in the register of virtue. A single evil thought resounds like an echo in a valley—though unheard by people, the gods have already heard it. There are gods who record evil deeds in the register of transgressions. Though the nature of good and evil differs, the swiftness of their karmic response is the same."

The perfected one bowed again and asked: "Though retribution is certain, its verification remains unheard."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The workings of the divine sages are without sound or form, yet they subtly manifest through human affairs. When people act, if they encounter good fortune, it is good retribution; if they encounter misfortune, it is evil retribution. Some perish in the sinking of carriages, horses, boats, or ships; some are consumed by raging fires or drowned in floods; some are slain by weapons, bandits, or calamities; some are devoured by tigers, wolves, insects, or snakes; some are imprisoned by officials or confined in dungeons; some are afflicted by malevolent spirits or demonic entities; some suffer from plagues, consumption, or incurable sores; some are harmed by inauspicious stars or baleful constellations; some are injured by poisons or witchcraft; some meet violent or untimely deaths—all such sufferings, though seemingly accidental, arise from evil causes that bring about these afflictions.

Even those who do good may encounter misfortune, but if they meet a virtuous person who resolves their troubles, it is divine protection. Do not assume that those who commit the Five Heinous Crimes or the Ten Evils enjoy peace and prosperity. Each has their own governing deities of destiny, local earth gods, city gods, and village spirits who report to their superiors in the Peak’s court, which then memorializes the Jade Emperor. By imperial decree, the Fire Department and Thunder Bureau verify the truth, awaiting the appointed time for punishment. The Emperor has commanded the Great Deities of Execution and Judgment to patrol the mortal world. If anyone plots to murder their parents or elders, though the act remains unformed, the evil intent has already arisen, and they will be swiftly executed. Their souls will descend to Fengdu, where they will suffer excruciating torments without hope of pardon.

Virtuous men and faithful women, after the end of their lives, will not see hell but will ascend directly to heaven. If reborn in the human realm, they will dwell in the Central Kingdom as men—intelligent, wealthy, noble, and long-lived."

The perfected one asked: "How can the karmic causes of past lives be clearly seen in retribution in this world?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "To know your past life, observe your present existence; to know your future life, observe your present conduct. If one is born in a royal palace, among imperial relatives, in the households of nobles or ministers, or in a tranquil and blessed place—free from toil in body and mind, enjoying peace, prosperity, and honor—this is the result of good causes from three past lives. If, though born among humans, one is blind or maimed, afflicted by sores, unable to find peace or healing, reduced to begging on the roads, suffering pain without injury, weeping on the ground and wailing to heaven—this is the retribution for past lives in which one disrespected heaven and earth, the Three Luminaries, and the Three Treasures, slandered the scriptures, and now receives this punishment.

If one is born with rotting lips, a missing nose, crippled hands or feet, and is despised and shunned by others—this is retribution for past lives in which one cursed the wind and rain, reviled parents and parents-in-law, relied on brute strength to bully the innocent, and now receives this punishment. If one suffers difficult childbirth, obstructed labor, or if the child survives while the mother perishes, or if both mother and child die—this is retribution for past lives in which one aborted fetuses, abandoned children, and harmed those entrusted to rebirth, and now receives this punishment. If one is born deaf, mute, or dumb, unable to hear or speak—this is retribution for past lives in which one schemed with cunning, deceiving the foolish, and now receives this punishment."

Or if one is clothed yet cannot ward off the cold, fed yet cannot stave off hunger, dying in ditches with one’s corpse left exposed—this is retribution for past lives in which one wasted the five grains and treated fine silks with contempt, and now receives this punishment. Or if one is born a woman in lowly circumstances, or suffers capture and enslavement by bandits and barbarians—this is retribution for past lives in which one relied on violence and deceit to oppress the good and kind, and now receives this punishment.

Such karmic consequences are beyond enumeration, yet all stem from past causes, their judgment infallible. Should one fail to awaken, repent past wrongs, sever evil, and cultivate goodness, one may be reborn among creatures with scales, shells, fur, or feathers—those with claws, fangs, hooves, or horns. There, many endure whipping, slaughter, boiling, and roasting, only to transform into tiny insects, making it difficult to regain human form.

Upon hearing these dire consequences, the Perfected One bowed deeply and said: “The people are ignorant, like newborn babes. By what practice may they avoid such retribution? I humbly beseech Your Celestial Compassion, vast in love for all life, to illuminate the path of goodness.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Though the Azure Cloud Primordial Sovereign punishes evil, her intent is to deliver beings. All who reform themselves will be saved. There are sacred incantations that dissolve past transgressions. I shall now proclaim them:

At the beginning of the Great Dao, there was no form, no speech. After Heaven and Earth parted, the myriad spirits assumed their authority. Mount Tai, the lofty peak, stabilized the Earth’s foundation. Within it dwells the Primordial Sovereign, known as the Heavenly Immortal. She first realized the imperial truth and ascended to the Azure Heavens. To transform sentient beings, she manifests a compassionate countenance. Her divine powers are vast, her virtue and majesty resplendent. She pacifies the people and protects the realm, awakens the world and upholds its primal essence. She aids loyalty and fosters filial piety, upholds righteousness and elevates the worthy. She preserves life and extends lifespan, ensuring descendants flourish. She dispels disasters, resolves calamities, delivers from distress, and erases transgressions. She drives away plagues, subdues poisons, severs malevolent influences, and reconciles grievances. The officials and generals of her mountain court issue commands with solemn authority. Those who are unkind or unjust, rebellious or wicked, who scorn the true Dao—are reduced to dust and smoke. Should any dare to curse her, they are sent to Mount Feng, their souls consigned to the dark prisons, never to be pardoned for ten thousand kalpas. Yet when the people pray to her, no wish remains unfulfilled. Her great compassion responds to all, universally aiding humans and gods alike.”

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected One Yu Luo: “If one turns their heart even for a moment, taking refuge in the true Dao, calming the spirit within and dissolving habitual tendencies without, one may invite a pure precept-holding Daoist to perform rites—whether in a temple or at home—preparing a solemn and purified altar. With wholehearted devotion, one should perform good deeds, recite this scripture—be it three, five, or seven times, or even a hundred or a thousand—pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign, burn incense in repentance, and visualize her compassionate visage as if she were truly present. Prostrating with the five limbs touching the ground, bowing a hundred times to implore her grace, one’s sins will be erased from the dark ledgers, and transgressions expunged from the mountain court. Household and self will enjoy peace and fortune, misfortunes will vanish, all endeavors will prosper, and every movement will be auspicious. The nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages will all attain freedom. Upon hearing these benefits, the Perfected One rejoiced exuberantly.

The Perfected One said: “Having now encountered this scripture, I vow to disseminate it among the people, that all may return to benevolence, cultivate harmony, and safeguard the realm in peace.”

The Perfected One bowed again and offered this hymn of praise:
Taking refuge in the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, past karma dissolves across three lifetimes.
Reciting the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, disasters will not befall one’s body.
Revering the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, ghosts and spirits hold one in awe.
Honoring the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, one’s family remains safe and serene.
Meditating on the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, essence, qi, and spirit merge in radiant harmony.
Venerating the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, fortune, prosperity, and longevity all increase.
Carrying the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, evil dares not approach.
Chanting the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, fields and homes flourish ever more.
Worshipping the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, fire and theft never arise.
Praising the *Azure Cloud Scripture*, all wishes come to fruition.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Noble indeed is Yu Luo, who brings such benefit and joy to gods and humans. Your merit is boundless; you are worthy of advancement in the ranks of immortals.”

After the Heavenly Worthy had expounded the scriptural method, he returned to the Pure Capital. The assembly of heavenly immortals bowed in reverence and saw him off, their joy beyond words. Then the Perfected One descended to transmit the scripture in the world, widely propagating its teachings.

Here ends the *Marvelous Scripture of the Primordial Sovereign of Azure Cloud for Protecting the Realm, Sheltering the People, and Universally Preserving Life*, spoken by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning.
