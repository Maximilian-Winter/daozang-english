**Ancient Investigations into the Origins of the *Yi*: The Title and Authorship**

*Ancient Investigations into the Origins of the Yi* (*Gǔ Yì Kǎo Yuán*). Composed by Méi Zú of the Ming dynasty. Three fascicles. Base text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.

**Fascicle One of *Ancient Investigations into the Origins of the Yi*: The Hexagrams of Fuxi**

The Master said: "The virtue of the hexagrams is square and knowing; knowing conceals what has passed." He also said: "The *Yi* accords with Heaven and Earth, and thus can encompass the Dao of Heaven and Earth." Looking up to observe the patterns of Heaven, looking down to examine the principles of Earth—thus one knows the causes of the hidden and the manifest. Tracing things to their origin and returning to their end, one knows the explanations of life and death. Essence and *qi* become things; wandering souls bring about change—thus one knows the conditions of ghosts and spirits. He further said: "It is stirred by thunder and lightning, moistened by wind and rain; the sun and moon move in their courses, alternating between cold and heat. The Dao of *Qian* completes the male; the Dao of *Kun* completes the female. *Qian* knows the great beginning; *Kun* brings things to fruition. *Qian* is easy to know; *Kun* is simple in its power." All these speak of the *Yi* of Fuxi’s hexagrams. Only because he first created them do we know the hexagrams that conceal within them the principles of all things in Heaven and Earth that have passed. Only then can the *Yi* of milfoil divination be put to use.

The *Yi* of the Three Dynasties all elucidated the *Yi* of Fuxi’s milfoil divination, employing it for the purpose of divination, yet none reached the *Yi* of the hexagrams. Only the Master alone attained the *Yi* of the hexagrams. Thus, in composing this work, *Investigations into the Origins*, I begin with the *Yi* of Fuxi’s hexagrams, to further the Master’s intent. Later Confucians, not understanding this meaning, claimed that the *Zhou Yi* was a late addition, asking, "What was the original basis of our ancestors?" How could such thoughts befit the dignity of their forebears?

**1. The First Creation of the Eight Trigrams**
The *Appended Judgments* state: "In ancient times, when Fuxi ruled all under Heaven, he looked up to observe the patterns of Heaven and looked down to examine the principles of Earth; he observed the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land. Drawing near, he took from his own body; from afar, he took from things. Thereupon, he first created the eight trigrams to communicate the power of the numinous and to categorize the conditions of the myriad things."

Zú says: Looking up to observe the images of Heaven and creating trigrams—such as *Qian* for Heaven, *Li* for the sun, *Zhen* for thunder, *Xun* for wind, *Kan* for the moon, clouds, and the Dipper’s radiance; looking down to observe the principles of Earth and creating trigrams—such as *Kun* for Earth, *Dui* for marsh, *Gen* for mountain, and *Kan* for water; observing the markings of birds and beasts—such as *Qian* representing the dragon, fine horses, and old horses; *Kun* representing the child and the cow; *Zhen* representing the dragon and the neighing horse; *Xun* representing the kite; *Kan* representing the pig and the horse with a fine back; *Li* representing the ox, pheasant, crab, tiger, and leopard; *Gen* representing the dog and rat; *Dui* representing the sheep; observing the suitability of the land to create trigrams—such as *Qian* representing fruit-bearing trees; *Zhen* representing green grains, bamboo, reeds, crops, reverse growth, and luxuriant freshness; *Xun* representing wood and poplar; *Kan* wood representing hardness, many cores, ridgepoles, thorny thickets, and lush grasses; *Li* wood representing hollow upper parts and withered stalks; *Gen* wood representing hardness and many knots.

"Drawing near, he took from his own body"—this does not refer only to the eight bodily parts but includes all eight categories, such as being a ruler or a father. "From afar, he took from things"—this does not refer only to clothing, food, utensils, and tools but includes all enumerated things, even to the myriad, such as gardens, jade, metal, cold, ice, greatness, and redness.

Fuxi’s classic trigrams number eight, and their variations number sixty-four. Now, it is only said that he "created the eight trigrams" because the classic encompasses the variations. Why is it said that the classic encompasses the variations? *Qian* is the classic trigram; if one takes *Qian* as *Qian*, then *Dui-Qian*, *Li-Qian*, *Zhen-Qian*, *Xun-Qian*, *Kan-Qian*, *Gen-Qian*, and *Kun-Qian*—the eight variations of *Qian*—are all encompassed. The same applies to the seven trigrams below *Dui*. Thus, *Qian*, *Gou*, *Dayou*, *Dazhuang*, *Xiaoxu*, *Xu*, *Daxu*, and *Tai* are said to derive from the first creation of *Qian*. *Lǚ*, *Dui*, *Kui*, *Guimei*, *Zhongfu*, *Jie*, *Sun*, and *Lin* derive from the first creation of *Dui*. *Tongren*, *Ge*, *Li*, *Feng*, *Jiaren*, *Jiji*, *Guai*, and *Mingyi* derive from the first creation of *Li*. *Wuwang*, *Sui*, *Shike*, *Zhen*, *Yi*, *Tun*, *Yi*, and *Fu* derive from the first creation of *Zhen*. *Heng*, *Daguo*, *Ding*, *Huan*, *Xun*, *Jing*, *Gu*, and *Sheng* derive from the first creation of *Xun*. *Song*, *Kun*, *Weiji*, *Xie*, *Jie*, *Kan*, *Meng*, and *Shi* derive from the first creation of *Kan*. *Lü*, *Xian*, *Lǚ*, *Xiaoguo*, *Jian*, *Jian*, *Gen*, and *Qian* derive from the first creation of *Gen*. *Pi*, *Cui*, *Jin*, *Yu*, *Guan*, *Bi*, *Bo*, and *Kun* derive from the first creation of *Kun*.

The sagely mind of Fuxi embraced the images of Heaven and the principles of Earth, the movements of animals and the stillness of plants, the nearness of the body and the distance of things—all were stored within. Only then did he create the eight trigrams to bequeath them to later generations under Heaven. Thus, the wonder of his trigrams encompasses the images and principles of Heaven and Earth, the movements of animals and the stillness of plants, the body and things—all principles are complete therein. They subtly assist the numinous and give rise to divination, communicating the power of the numinous and devising implements to emulate images, taking freely and sufficiently to categorize the conditions of the myriad things.

Han Confucians claimed that he drew the trigrams following the *Hetu*, while Song Confucians claimed that seeing a turtle could suffice to draw the trigrams—all these are baseless conjectures, failing to perceive Fuxi’s essence and not glimpsing the Master’s intent. Those who go to extremes even claim that he first created the eight trigrams of three lines, and that King Wen later doubled them into sixty-four hexagrams. I resolutely reject all such claims, precisely for this reason.

Now, I arrange their diagrams to the left.

*Qian* below, *Qian* above, still named *Qian*.
Zú says: This is the classic trigram *Qian*.

*Qian* below, *Dui* above, named *Guai*.

Zú says: From *Qian* below to *Tai* are its derivative *Qian* trigrams.

Zú says: The above eight hexagrams speak of Fuxi’s initial creation of the *Qian* trigram. The primary *Qian* trigram is rightly called the beginning, so it is fitting that *Qian* was first created. But why are all its derivative hexagrams also called "created *Qian*"? When *Qian* is below, it serves as the master within, with the eight trigrams added above to elucidate *Qian*’s variations—hence they are collectively named "created *Qian*." Yet when *Qian* is above another trigram, it does not serve as master but becomes a variation of that trigram.

Zú says: The above eight hexagrams speak of Fuxi’s initial creation of the *Dui* trigram. The primary *Dui* trigram is rightly called the beginning, so it is fitting that *Dui* was first created. But why are all its derivative hexagrams also called "created *Dui*"? When *Dui* is below, it serves as the master within, with the eight trigrams added above to elucidate *Dui*’s variations—hence they are collectively named "created *Dui*." Yet when *Dui* is above another trigram, it does not serve as master but becomes a variation of that trigram.

Zú says: From *Tongren* to *Mingyi* are its derivative *Li* trigrams.

Zú says: The above eight hexagrams speak of Fuxi’s initial creation of the *Li* trigram. The primary *Li* trigram is rightly called the beginning, so it is fitting that *Li* was first created. But why are all its derivative hexagrams also called "created *Li*"? When *Li* is below, it serves as the master within, with the eight trigrams added above to elucidate *Li*’s variations—hence they are collectively named "created *Li*." Yet when *Li* is above another trigram, it does not serve as master but becomes a variation of that trigram.

*Xun* below, *Qian* above, named *Gòu*.

*Xun* below, *Gen* above, named *Gǔ*.
*Xun* below, *Kun* above, named *Shēng*.
Zú says: From *Gòu* to *Shēng* are its derivative *Xun* trigrams.

Zú says: The above eight hexagrams speak of Fuxi’s initial creation of the *Xun* trigram. The primary *Xun* trigram is rightly called the beginning, so it is fitting that *Xun* was first created. But why are all its derivative hexagrams also called "created *Xun*"? When *Xun* is below, it serves as the master within, with the eight trigrams added above to elucidate *Xun*’s variations—hence they are collectively named "created *Xun*." Yet when *Xun* is above another trigram, it does not serve as master but becomes a variation of that trigram.

Zú says: From *Sòng* to *Shī* are its derivative *Kan* trigrams.

Zú says: The above eight hexagrams speak of Fuxi’s initial creation of the *Kan* trigram. The primary *Kan* trigram is rightly called the beginning, so it is fitting that *Kan* was first created. But why are all its derivative hexagrams also called "created *Kan*"? When *Kan* is below, it serves as the master within, with the eight trigrams added above to elucidate *Kan*’s variations—hence they are collectively named "created *Kan*." Yet when *Kan* is above another trigram, it does not serve as master but becomes a variation of that trigram.

Zú says: From *Dùn* to *Qiān* are its derivative *Gen* trigrams.

Zú says: The above eight hexagrams speak of Fuxi’s initial creation of the *Gen* trigram. The primary *Gen* trigram is rightly called the beginning, so it is fitting that *Gen* was first created. But why are all its derivative hexagrams also called "created *Gen*"? When *Gen* is below, it serves as the master within, with the eight trigrams added above to elucidate *Gen*’s variations—hence they are collectively named "created *Gen*." Yet when *Gen* is above another trigram, it does not serve as master but becomes a variation of that trigram.

*Kun* below, *Xun* above, named *Guān*.
*Kun* below, *Kan* above, named *Bǐ*.
*Kun* below, *Gen* above, named *Bō*.
*Kun* below, *Kun* above, still named *Kun*.
Zú says: This is the primary *Kun* trigram.
It is also said: From *Pǐ* to *Kun* are its derivative *Kun* trigrams.

Zú says: The above eight hexagrams speak of Fuxi’s initial creation of the *Kun* trigram. The primary *Kun* trigram is rightly called the beginning, so it is fitting that *Kun* was first created. But why are all its derivative hexagrams also called "created *Kun*"? When *Kun* is below, it serves as the master within, with the eight trigrams added above to elucidate *Kun*’s variations—hence they are collectively named "created *Kun*." Yet when *Kun* is above another trigram, it does not serve as master but becomes a variation of that trigram.

**Circular Movement of the Eight Trigrams**
The *Shuogua* states: "Heaven and Earth take their positions; mountain and marsh exchange qi; thunder and wind press upon each other; water and fire do not clash."

Moreover, it states: "In counting what has passed, one follows the sequence."

Zú says: This speaks of Fuxi’s sixty-four hexagrams in their circular movement. Though only the eight trigrams are mentioned, the primary forms are cited to encompass their derivatives. Heaven takes its position in the south, and its eight derivative heavens all take position in the south. Earth takes its position in the north, and its eight derivative earths all take position in the north. Mountain exchanges qi in the northwest, and its eight derivative mountains all exchange qi in the northwest. Marsh exchanges qi in the southeast, and its eight derivative marshes all exchange qi in the southeast. Thunder presses upon in the northeast, and its eight derivative thunders all press upon in the northeast. Wind presses upon in the southwest, and its eight derivative winds all press upon in the southwest. Water does not clash in the west, and its eight derivative waters all do not clash in the west. Fire does not clash in the east, and its eight derivative fires all do not clash in the east. The names of the hexagrams are not specified because the Master invariably spoke in terms of images.

Former scholars believed this referred solely to the eight trigrams of three lines, but this is incorrect. Why is it said that "in counting what has passed, one follows the sequence"? Heaven’s position is in the south; moving left from the south, one passes through heaven, then marsh, then fire, then thunder; moving right from the south, one passes through wind, then water, then mountain, then earth—all proceeding from south to north, from above to below. Thus it is said: the positions of what has already passed are fixed in sequence, following without reversal, as they have been from antiquity to the present.

**Rectangular Arrangement of the Eight Trigrams**
The *Shuogua* states: "The eight trigrams intermingle; in knowing what is to come, one moves in reverse—thus the *Yi* reckons in reverse."

It further states: "Thunder moves them; wind disperses them; rain moistens them; the sun warms them; *Gen* halts them; *Dui* delights them; *Qian* rules them; *Kun* conceals them."

Zú says: This speaks of Fuxi’s sixty-four hexagrams in their rectangular arrangement. Though only the eight trigrams are mentioned, the primary forms are again cited to encompass their derivatives. The eight trigrams intermingle, building upon the circular movement of heaven and earth, mountain and marsh, thunder and wind, water and fire, now intersecting one another in a rectangular array.

Shao Yaofu believed that the eight trigrams in the preceding passage referred to the three-line trigrams, and that only when they intermingled—each of the eight trigrams being overlaid with another eight—did the sixty-four hexagrams emerge. Thus he took "intermingling" to mean "layering." But to conflate intermingling with layering is mistaken. Otherwise, this passage, which speaks of thunder moving things, would pertain solely to the rectangular arrangement of the eight trigrams, with no reference to intermingling. This would imply that the circular movement encompasses the sixty-four hexagrams, while the rectangular arrangement includes only the eight trigrams—a manifestly incoherent claim.

Thunder moves things in the middle left; wind disperses things in the middle right. Their eight derivative thunders all move things in the middle left, and their eight derivative winds all disperse things in the middle right. Rain moistens things next to wind; the sun warms things next to thunder. Their eight derivative rains all moisten things next to wind, and their eight derivative suns all warm things next to thunder. *Gen* halts things next to rain; *Dui* delights things next to the sun. Their eight derivative *Gen* all halt things next to rain, and their eight derivative *Dui* all delight things next to the sun. *Qian* rules things, residing in the north; *Kun* conceals things, residing in the south. Their eight derivative *Qian* all rule things in the north, and their eight derivative *Kun* all conceal things in the south.

Though the relative positions of the hexagrams remain the same as in the preceding passage, their order and sequence differ greatly. In the earlier passage, heaven and earth held the first positions; here, *Li* and *Kan* occupy the center, while *Qian* and *Kun* bring up the rear—thus heaven and earth intermingle with water and fire. In the earlier passage, mountain and marsh held the second position; here, *Gen* and *Dui* occupy the third—thus mountain and marsh intermingle with thunder and wind. In the earlier passage, thunder and wind held the second position; here, they occupy the center—thus thunder and wind intermingle with heaven and earth. In the earlier passage, water and fire held the fourth position; here, rain and sun occupy the second—thus water and fire intermingle with mountain and marsh.

Examined in further detail: Heaven is in the south and earth in the north, but now *Qian* is in the north and *Kun* in the south—thus *Qian* and *Kun* intermingle. Marsh is in the southeast and mountain in the northwest, but now *Dui* is next to the north and *Gen* next to the south—thus *Dui* and *Gen* intermingle. Fire is in the east and water in the west, but now the sun is next to the north and rain next to the south—thus *Li* and *Kan* intermingle. Thunder is in the northeast and wind in the southwest, but now thunder moves in the north-center and wind disperses in the south-center—thus *Zhen* and *Xun* intermingle. Proceeding from *Qian* to *Dui*, then *Li*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun*—all move from north to south, from below to above. Thus it is said: "In knowing what is to come, one moves in reverse."

Because the phrase "the eight trigrams intermingle" in the preceding passage was too concise to be clear, these eight sentences are listed in detail to elucidate the meaning of rectangular intermingling. Yet former scholars all claimed that in the circular movement, *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* represent "counting what has passed in sequence," while *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun* represent "knowing what is to come in reverse"—a view that does not hold. For in Fuxi’s sequence of hexagrams, from *Qian* to *Kun*, there was never any such distinction of sequence. The Master’s intent was merely to borrow the circular movement’s sequence and the rectangular arrangement’s reversal to illuminate the *Xici*’s meaning: "Wisdom conceals what has passed; spirit knows what is to come." The diagram is now presented below.

**Fuxi’s Rectangular Diagram of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams**
Zú says: Scholars have kept this secret among the diviners, and only with Chen Xiyi was it transmitted to Shao Yaofu, who first elucidated it. Such claims are profoundly thoughtless. The Master’s words shine as brightly as the sun and stars. Fuxi originally used the hexagrams, while the Master spoke in terms of images to expound upon them—thus without reflection, one cannot grasp their essence. For this reason, the diagram is presented in detail below, so that later generations may know that what the diviners kept secret originated in the Master’s words and is beyond doubt.

As for those who arrange the three-line trigrams into directional diagrams, this is not Fuxi’s original truth, nor did the Master ever speak of it. Thus, it has now been removed to avoid misleading later generations.

These two diagrams embody the principle of yin-yang correspondence. The circular form represents yang, the square yin; the circular moves as heaven, the square rests as earth.

Zú says: From *Qián* (Heaven) to *Dì-Qián* (Earth-Heaven), the eight trigrams position heaven in the south. From *Kūn* (Earth) to *Dì-Kūn* (Earth-Earth), the eight trigrams position earth in the north. From *Gèn* (Mountain) to *Dì-Gèn* (Earth-Mountain), the eight trigrams convey that mountains channel qi in the northwest. From *Duì* (Marsh) to *Dì-Duì* (Earth-Marsh), the eight trigrams convey that marshes channel qi in the southeast. From *Zhèn* (Thunder) to *Dì-Zhèn* (Earth-Thunder), the eight trigrams convey that thunder clashes in the northeast. From *Xùn* (Wind) to *Dì-Xùn* (Earth-Wind), the eight trigrams convey that wind clashes in the southwest. From *Lí* (Fire) to *Dì-Lí* (Earth-Fire), the eight trigrams convey that fire does not oppose itself in the east. From *Kǎn* (Water) to *Dì-Kǎn* (Earth-Water), the eight trigrams convey that water does not oppose itself in the west.

In this circular arrangement of the sixty-four hexagrams, all proceed from south to north, from above to below—thus it is called "sequential." The eight hexagrams of *Zhèn* (Thunder) animate beings; the eight of *Xùn* (Wind) disperse them—this is the spring of living things. The eight of *Kǎn* (Rain) moisten beings; the eight of *Lí* (Sun) warm them—this is the summer of growing things. The eight of *Gèn* (Mountain) halt beings; the eight of *Duì* (Marsh) delight them—this is the autumn of harvesting things. The eight of *Qián* (Heaven) govern beings; the eight of *Kūn* (Earth) store them—this is the winter of concealing things.

In this square arrangement of the sixty-four hexagrams, all proceed from north to south, from below to above—thus it is called "reversal." The *Xiāntiān* (Pre-Heaven) diagrams transmitted by Master Shao originated from this.

Above, the horizontal diagram is presented first, followed by the circular and square diagrams—thus Fuxi’s hexagrammatic *Yi* may be examined in this way.

*Ancient Yi Textual Origins, Volume One* concludes here.

The *Yi* of Fuxi’s Milfoil Divination

The Master said: "The virtue of milfoil is round and spirit-like; through spirit, it knows what is to come." He also said: "It resembles heaven and earth, thus it does not transgress. Its knowledge pervades the myriad things, and its Dao aids the world—thus it does not err. It moves broadly without dissipation, delights in heaven and knows fate—thus it is without sorrow. Content with its place and earnest in benevolence, it can love—thus its spirit is without limit."

He further said: "Heaven is noble, earth is humble—*Qián* and *Kūn* are thus established. The humble and noble are arrayed—ranks and positions are thus determined. Movement and stillness have constancy—firmness and softness are thus decided. Things gather by kind, beings divide into groups—good and ill fortune thus arise. In heaven, images form; on earth, shapes take form—transformation and change are thus manifest." Therefore, firmness and softness grind against each other, and the eight trigrams surge together. All these speak of Fuxi’s *Yi* of milfoil divination.

Only by possessing the round, spirit-like art of milfoil divination can one seek the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things within the hexagrams that conceal the past. Only then can the future’s good and ill fortune, regrets and humiliations be known. Thus, this work of textual origins follows with the *Yi* of Fuxi’s milfoil divination.

**The River Chart (First)**
The *Xici* says: "The Yellow River brought forth the Chart; the Luo River brought forth the Writing—sages took them as models." It also says: "Heaven-one, earth-two; heaven-three, earth-four; heaven-five, earth-six; heaven-seven, earth-eight; heaven-nine, earth-ten. Heaven’s numbers are five, earth’s numbers are five; the five positions interact and each has its union. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five; earth’s numbers total thirty. Together, heaven and earth’s numbers total fifty-five. This is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits operate."

Zú says: Sages took the River Chart as the model for generating milfoil divination, just as they took the Luo Writing as the model for turtle-shell divination. Following the preceding statement that "nothing is greater than milfoil and turtle-shell divination," both the River Chart and Luo Writing are thus mentioned. The *Book of Han: Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendar* quotes this passage from "heaven-one" to "the spirits operate" as sixty-four continuous characters. After Bān Gù (Mèngjiān), it is unclear when Gāo Dì placed the twenty characters from "heaven-one" to "earth-ten" in the later chapter. Now, following the Chéng-Zhū school, the misplaced bamboo slips are corrected. This is what is called the numerical pattern of the River Chart.

A dragon-horse emerged from the Yellow River, its back bearing swirling hair arranged in circular patterns like stars—hence it is called a "chart," and since it emerged from the river, it is called the "River Chart." Generally, the numbers of the world begin with one and are completed by ten—nothing exceeds ten. Adding one to one makes ten; adding ten to one makes two. From this ten arise hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, and all numbers beyond ten.

Yet the numbers of the River Chart differ. Heaven-one is one; when heaven-three is added to heaven-one, it becomes four. One obtains one, three obtains three, and three unites with one. When heaven-five is added, it interacts with one and three to form nine. When heaven-seven is added, it interacts with one, three, and five to form sixteen. When heaven-nine is added, it interacts with one, three, five, and seven to form twenty-five. Five is called the proper number of heaven; twenty is called the extended number. Though it is said to extend to twenty, in truth it does not exceed heaven’s five.

Earth-two is two; when earth-four is added to two, it becomes six. Two obtains two, four obtains four, and two unites with four. When earth-six is added, it interacts with two and four to form twelve. When earth-eight is added, it interacts with two, four, and six to form twenty. When earth-ten is added, it interacts with two, four, six, and eight to form thirty.

Five is called the proper number of earth; twenty-five is called the extended number. Though it is said to extend to twenty-five, in truth it does not exceed earth’s five.

The sum of heaven’s and earth’s numbers is fifty-five. Ten is called the proper number of heaven and earth; forty-five is called the extended number of heaven and earth. Yet the extended number does not exceed ten. Though it does not exceed ten, it extends to fifty-five. Thus, heaven’s numbers, originally odd, transform through yang to become yin; earth’s numbers, originally even, transform through yin to become yang. Through these fifty-five numbers, completion and transformation, contraction and expansion, coming and going—its subtlety is inexhaustible. Through these fifty-five numbers, the Dao flows.

How could the sage Fuxi fail to take this as the number of the Great Expansion, using it to manipulate milfoil stalks and divine the hexagrams? The method of taking it follows below.

**The Great Expansion, Second Chapter**
The number of the Great Expansion is fifty; its use is forty-nine. Divide them into two to symbolize the Two (yin and yang); suspend one to symbolize the Three (heaven, earth, and humanity); count them by fours to symbolize the four seasons; return the remainders to the beginning to symbolize intercalary months. Five years require two intercalations, hence the second counting follows the suspension.

The commentary states: This continues the preceding discussion, explaining how Fuxi took the numbers of the River Chart to manipulate milfoil stalks and divine the hexagrams. The River Chart’s heavenly numbers, five, extend to twenty-five; its earthly numbers, five, extend to thirty. Yet this still does not exhaust the full extent of the extension. Thus, Fuxi took the River Chart and further expanded its principles to ninety-nine.

The Great Expansion: one and two make three; two and three make five; three and four make seven; four and five make nine. Combining three, five, seven, and nine yields twenty-four. Then, five and six make eleven, with one residing in the center. Further, six and seven make thirteen; seven and eight make fifteen; eight and nine make seventeen; nine and ten make nineteen. Combining three, five, seven, and nine again yields twenty-four. Together with the tens from eleven, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, and nineteen—five tens in all—this forms the essential number of the Great Expansion, hence it is said, “The number of the Great Expansion is fifty.” Combining the first twenty-four, the latter twenty-four, and the one in the center totals forty-nine, which is the operational number of the Great Expansion, hence it is said, “its use is forty-nine.” Though it extends to ninety-nine, it does not exceed the range from heaven-one to earth-ten. This is why it serves as the extended number of the River Chart and the ultimate number of the Great Expansion.

The Master (Confucius) introduced the term “extension” to elucidate the meaning of the River Chart, adding the word “Great” to clarify Fuxi’s principle of taking the River Chart. The sage’s brushwork is like the work of creation—its subtlety is inexhaustible, yet it is simple and easily understood. Is this not truly so?

The method of manipulating milfoil stalks seeks their changes: some take their words, some their use, some their essence. Though fifty is the Great Expansion of the River Chart, it remains static within change and the essence within use, hence it is set aside and unused. Forty-nine, however, is change within change and use within use, thus it is specifically employed to manipulate milfoil stalks and divine the hexagrams.

Counting from one to the left and right, all are one, three, five, seven, nine—the five heavenly numbers, the pure and unadulterated essence of Qian, free from the impurity of yin’s even numbers. The two sets of twenty-four before and after symbolize the division into two. The one residing in the center symbolizes the suspension of one. The four instances of three, five, seven, and nine symbolize counting by fours. The second set of three, five, seven, and nine symbolizes the second counting. All arise from the natural patterns of heaven’s mechanism, without the slightest interference of human effort or private knowledge.

Here we see the divine craftsmanship of Fuxi’s creation—its marvels surpass what ordinary reason can fathom. The Lianshan and Guicang systems, followed by the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, all adhered to this method. Though their sequences varied, their principles did not transgress this foundation.

Now, the Jin scholars, drawing on the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi to interpret the *Book of Changes*, claim: “The forty-nine stalks represent the fifty with one left unused. Leaving one unused symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate.” The Supreme Ultimate is the pivot of creation, the root of transformation, the wondrous union of principle and qi in the myriad things—it is never absent for even a moment. Yet they single out one stalk, cast it aside into an unused box, and relegate it to stillness. This implies that creation and the myriad things sometimes lack a pivot or root, and that principle and qi may at times be separated. Meanwhile, the operations of “suspending two, hanging one, counting by fours, and returning the remainders” are all managed by the forty-nine stalks, while the Supreme Ultimate, the single stalk, idly rests in its box, oblivious to its role in unifying all. Is it not less useful than the forty-nine stalks? Their theory is truly perverse.

The set-aside stalk and the forty-nine stalks in use are identical in length and size. Yet by casually setting aside one stalk, they arbitrarily transform an instrument into the Dao, alter its form into principle, and exalt it as the Supreme Ultimate, venerating it as divinely subtle beyond compare. How fortunate for it! Meanwhile, the forty-nine stalks in use lose their pivot, sever their root, and toil busily in external operations, unable to rival the set-aside stalk. How profoundly unfortunate for them! This further reveals the absurdity of the Jin scholars’ interpretation of the classic.

Moreover, the River Chart’s extended number is fifty-five. Yet the Great Expansion reduces it by five—how can it still be called the Great Expansion?

Zhuo observes: According to the *Book of Han·Treatise on the Five Agents*, Liu Xin states: "Fu Xi received the River Chart and accordingly drew the Eight Trigrams." This refers to that. "Yu regulated the floodwaters and was granted the Luo Writing, from which he arranged the *Great Plan*." This refers to that. Master Shao says: "The circular represents the stars. Does the reckoning of celestial cycles originate here? The square represents the earth. Do the methods of dividing lands and well-fields derive from this?" The circular belongs to the numbers of the River Chart. The square belongs to the patterns of the Luo Writing. Thus, Fu Xi and King Wen relied on them to create the *Changes*, while Yu and Ji used them to compose the *Plan*.

Master Wu says: "The River Chart emerged when a dragon-horse appeared in the River, its coat bearing spiral markings that formed these ten numbers. The Luo Writing emerged when a divine tortoise appeared in the Luo, its shell’s cracks forming these nine numbers. As the spiral markings resembled the round dots of stars, it was called a *Chart*. As the cracks resembled the vertical and horizontal strokes of writing, it was called a *Writing*. The River Chart’s horse differed from ordinary horses only in that its coat’s spirals formed these ten numbers. The Luo Writing’s tortoise differed from ordinary tortoises only in that its shell’s cracks formed these nine numbers. Even today, horses’ coats bear spirals resembling star-dots, though they do not form these ten numbers. Even today, tortoises’ shells bear cracks resembling written strokes, though they do not form these nine numbers."

Master Zheng says: "The River produces the Chart, possessing natural images. The Luo produces the Writing, possessing natural patterns." Zhuo says: "Fu Xi used the River Chart to generate the milfoil stalks and the Luo Writing to create the tortoise-shell divination. The principle of the River Chart is precisely the Great Expansion. Here, the Chart is presented to the left. The principle of the Luo Writing remains unclear. Later, during the time of the divine Yu, the Luo also produced a Writing, which Yu used to arrange the *Plan*. In the reign of King Cheng, the Chenbao River Chart was kept in the eastern chamber. Confucius also said: 'The River does not produce the Chart,' pairing it with the phoenix and black crow as auspicious signs of sage-kings. How venerable! Heaven One, Heaven Three, Heaven Five, Heaven Seven, Heaven Nine—these five positions interact and each has its correspondence. The heavenly numbers total twenty-five. These five positions are the five heavenly numbers in five positions, thus interacting and each having correspondence, expanding to twenty-five. Earth Two, Earth Four, Earth Six, Earth Eight, Earth Ten—these five positions interact and each has its correspondence. The earthly numbers total thirty. These five positions are the five earthly numbers in five positions, thus interacting and each having correspondence, expanding to thirty. The total of heavenly and earthly numbers is fifty-five. The heavenly numbers are merely five, yet they expand to twenty combinations, totaling twenty-five—never exceeding the five numbers. The earthly numbers are merely five, yet they expand to twenty-five combinations, totaling thirty—also never exceeding the five numbers. The sum of heavenly and earthly numbers, fifty-five, likewise never exceeds the total of the five positions from Heaven One to Earth Ten, which together form ten numbers. Yet it yields an additional fifty-five numbers, as if the Writing had redundant text. Thus, I call it the River Chart’s extended numbers."

Zhuo says: "The Han scholars interpreted 'five positions interacting and each having correspondence' as the interactions and correspondences of One and Six, Two and Seven, Three and Eight, Four and Nine, Five and Ten. If this were so, it should be called *ten positions*, not *five positions*. Moreover, they should have immediately connected this to the total of heavenly and earthly numbers, fifty-five, rather than further dividing them into twenty-five heavenly numbers and thirty earthly numbers. Since they have already divided them, it is clear that the five heavenly positions refer to the five heavenly numbers above, and the five earthly positions refer to the five earthly numbers above. They cannot then be interpreted as ten positions interacting and having correspondence. These are all errors in the Han scholars’ exegesis of the classic, which must not go uncorrected.

Eleven tens, thirteen tens, fifteen tens, seventeen tens, nineteen tens—five instances of ten form the essential numbers of the Great Expansion. The preceding and following twenty-four make forty-eight, with one residing in the center. Together, they form forty-nine, the operational numbers of the Great Expansion. Setting aside the essential numbers and using only the operational numbers involves the methods of suspending one, dividing into two, counting four, and repeated manipulation. This further arises from the purity of heavenly (odd) numbers, avoiding the impurity of earthly (even) admixtures. This is why Fu Xi adopted it for the people’s use."

Zhuo says: "Confucius praised the subtlety of the River Chart’s numbers, saying: 'This is how transformations are completed and spirits are set in motion.' He also said: 'One who knows the Way of transformation knows where the spiritual acts.' Again: 'The spiritual is without direction.' Again: 'The unfathomable in yin and yang is called the spiritual.' Again: 'Obscurely assisting the numinous brightness to generate the milfoil, weighing heaven and earth to rely on numbers.' Again: 'Communicating the virtue/power of the numinous brightness.' Nowhere did he speak of using it to draw the Eight Trigrams. This was Liu Xin’s delusion, which earlier scholars mistakenly followed. Thus, I have specially created this diagram to elucidate Confucius’ intent. Readers should reflect deeply upon it."

**Third: Establishing Trigrams and Generating Lines through Milfoil Divination**
The virtue/power of the milfoil is circular and spiritual; seven sevens make it circular. The virtue/power of the trigrams is square and knowing; eight eights make it square. The meaning of the six lines lies in the *Changes*’ capacity to inform: the nine and six (yang and yin lines) alternate in hardness and softness to convey messages to people. The sage uses this to purify the heart, retiring and concealing it in secrecy. With this milfoil divination and six lines, he purifies his heart of worldly concerns, gathering and concealing it in a place of stillness and depth. Fortune and misfortune are shared with the people as common afflictions. The spiritual knows what is to come; knowing conceals what has passed. How could the sage’s heart, unable to forget the people’s afflictions, retire and conceal itself in secrecy? The spiritual power of the milfoil knows fortune and misfortune before they arrive; the knowing of the trigrams conceals the fixed principles of fortune and misfortune. That it does not speak of the lines’ capacity to inform is because this is encompassed by the trigrams’ knowing."

The people seek divination through milfoil to obtain hexagrams, hastening toward fortune and avoiding misfortune. Thus, the sage’s heart is no longer burdened with worry and can retire and conceal itself in secrecy—who else could achieve this? The ancients who embodied perfect clarity, divine martial prowess yet refrained from killing were none other than Fuxi. Therefore, he understood the Dao of Heaven and examined the people’s circumstances, raising forth sacred objects to guide their use. These sacred objects refer to the milfoil. The sage used them in purification rites to spiritually illuminate his virtue. Concentrated refinement is called *zhai* (fasting); dispersed vigilance is called *jie* (abstinence). The sage lodged his spirit in the virtue of the milfoil and his clarity in the virtue of the hexagrams. Without purification rites, he could not summon his own spiritual illumination to spiritually illuminate his virtue.

Thus, closing the door is called *Kun*; grasping the milfoil in hand. Opening the door is called *Qian*; dividing the milfoil to cast. One closing and one opening is called *change*. The casting of milfoil undergoes one change, and its endless coming and going is called *penetration*. The varying quantities of milfoil are difficult to fix, so what appears is called *image*. After three changes of the milfoil, the transformation yields odd numbers: seven odd numbers symbolize firmness, eight even numbers symbolize softness, nine symbolizes great firmness, and six symbolizes great softness. The four images take form and are called *vessels*. Deriving form from image, when many are called *objects and vessels*, shaping and employing them is called *method*. Their utility in daily life, universally adopted by the people, is called *spiritual*. The closing and opening, change and penetration, are the milfoil’s circular images, vessels, and methods. That the people universally employ them is the milfoil’s spirituality.

Thus, the *Yi* has the Supreme Polarity. *Yi* refers to the casting and arranging of milfoil. The grasping and dividing of milfoil inherently symbolize the opening and closing of doors. When it remains in the box unopened, does it yet contain the four images? The roof ridge stands above while the four sides converge upon it—this is called the *pole*. Forty-nine milfoil stalks, undifferentiated in the box, undergo one change, three changes, nine changes, and eighteen changes, and the *Yi*’s profound transformations are already fully present here. It is like the great ridgepole of a vast hall, incomparable to an ordinary roof beam. Thus it is said: *The Yi has the Supreme Polarity, which generates the Two Modes.* Generation occurs when they are taken from the box. Closing the door is the *Kun* mode; opening the door is the *Qian* mode. The two harmonize in virtue, hence it is said: *This generates the Two Modes.* Now, in the city, two gates are inscribed as *Gate of Modes*. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, which are generated by the casting of milfoil. The Four Images—seven, eight, nine, and six—symbolize firmness, softness, elder, and younger: seven for young firmness, eight for young softness, nine for great firmness, and six for great softness. Distinguishing elder and younger is how they instruct people. Thus it is said: *The Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams.* Each of the Four Images governs one aspect, and the Eight Trigrams form their arrangement. If the inner Eight Trigrams are presented, the outer Eight Trigrams need not be mentioned—this is an economy of language. The Eight Trigrams determine fortune and misfortune, and within eighteen changes, the inner and outer Eight Trigrams are complete. Then the diviner presents the hexagram, observes the images, and contemplates the oracle to determine fortune and misfortune. Fortune and misfortune give rise to great undertakings. Once fortune and misfortune are determined, all doubts are resolved, and one advances or retreats accordingly, producing the greatest achievements.

Therefore, no model surpasses Heaven and Earth. This continues the idea that the Two Modes form images: *Qian* emulates Heaven’s constancy, *Kun* emulates Earth’s adaptability—nothing surpasses the four seasons. This continues the idea of one closing and one opening, endless coming and going. The text speaks of arranging them in fours to symbolize the four seasons. No suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon. This continues the idea that what appears is called *image*. Thus, great firmness becomes the sun, and great softness becomes the moon. No aspiration is loftier than wealth and honor. The previous line speaks of fortune and misfortune; this line continues the idea of great undertakings. With attainable resources and the power to attain them, punishing the guilty and aiding the people, positioning oneself between Heaven and Earth, nurturing the myriad things—what is not a great undertaking? It is especially fitting to consult divination, prepare implements for use, and establish vessels to benefit all under Heaven—nothing surpasses the sage. He employs milfoil to guide the people’s use, establishes hexagram images to create vessels, enabling all under Heaven to esteem divination and emulate great undertakings. Only a sage of perfect clarity, divine martial prowess, and nonviolence can achieve this.

Thus it is said: *Nothing is greater than milfoil and tortoise shells for probing the hidden, drawing forth the profound, reaching the distant, and determining the world’s fortune and misfortune, or for accomplishing the world’s ceaseless endeavors.* This extols the spirituality of milfoil and tortoise shells to show that the sage’s benefit to all under Heaven is unparalleled. The following text further elaborates.

Therefore, Heaven produces sacred objects, and the sage takes them as models. Sacred objects include the aforementioned milfoil and tortoise shells. The sage models milfoil on the *River Chart* and tortoise shells on the *Luo Writing*, as described below. Heaven and Earth transform, and the sage emulates them. Transformation is change and penetration; emulating Heaven and Earth involves closing and opening doors, and emulating transformation involves one closing and one opening, endless coming and going. Heaven suspends images to reveal fortune and misfortune, and the sage models them. Suspended images reveal fortune and misfortune, that is, luminous images—this demonstrates to people the divination of fortune and misfortune, ultimately revealing images to determine fortune and misfortune. The *River* yields the *Chart*; the *Luo* yields the *Writing*, and the sage models them. He models the *River Chart* to arrange milfoil and the *Luo Writing* to create tortoise-shell divination. This concludes the earlier statement about Heaven producing sacred objects.

The commentator says: This chapter focuses on the spirituality of milfoil. Yet milfoil’s spirituality lies in its ability to extract the hexagrams’ square knowledge. The six lines’ capacity to inform is how they reveal fortune and misfortune to people, enabling them to achieve great undertakings. This is its spirituality. Earlier scholars claimed the Supreme Polarity is the Dao, the Two Modes are the first two lines, and the Four Images are the next four lines—these errors all originate from Master Shao. Here, I present his diagrams and explanations to the left.

The commentator says: The Master spoke of *The Yi has the Supreme Polarity, which generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams*—he never spoke of eight generating sixteen, sixteen generating thirty-two, or thirty-two generating sixty-four.

Master Shao said: Once the Supreme Polarity divides, the Two Modes are established. When yang ascends to intersect with yin, and yin descends to intersect with yang, the Four Images arise. Yang intersecting with yin and yin intersecting with yang generate the Four Images of Heaven; hard intersecting with soft and soft intersecting with hard generate the Four Images of Earth—thus the Eight Trigrams are completed. Only after the Eight Trigrams intermingle do the myriad things come into being. Therefore, one divides to become two in *Yi*, two divides to become four, four divides to become eight, eight divides to become sixteen, sixteen divides to become thirty-two, and thirty-two divides to become sixty-four—like a root giving rise to a trunk, a trunk to branches, and branches to leaves. The larger the division, the fewer the parts; the finer the division, the more numerous they become. United, they form one; extended, they become ten thousand.

Master Zhu said: That days have odd and even, and trigrams consist of three lines, all flow forth naturally without contrivance. This is the guiding principle of *Yi* learning, the first meaning upon opening the text. Yet from ancient times to the present, no one has recognized this—until Master Kangjie transmitted the learning of the Primordial Heaven and grasped its explanation, regarding it as the *Yi* of Fuxi. However, from my youth I read this with doubt, and as I matured, my doubts only deepened. I respectfully set forth my uncertainties below.

*Yi* means "change." Earlier scholars said: Between Heaven and Earth, there is only yin and yang. Fuxi drew one unbroken line to represent yang and one broken line to represent yin. Then, from one yang and one yin alternating, he derived the Four Images and the Eight Trigrams, extending to the sixty-four hexagrams—all transformations of the hexagram lines. Beyond this, he further established the changes in milfoil-stalk numbers, hence the name *Yi*. Yet Fuxi himself did not originally have the character *Yi*.

I note: This explanation is far from precise. The *Yi* character here follows the previous chapter’s "four operations to complete the *Yi*," so the subsequent text—"giving rise to the Four Images, giving rise to the Eight Trigrams, determining fortune and misfortune, generating great undertakings"—refers specifically to the changes of milfoil stalks. If it also included the changes of hexagram lines, it would conflict with Fuxi’s original creation of the Eight Trigrams’ forms. The details are discussed below under the Two Modes and Four Images.

Not only this: In the lower chapter, "Qian and Kun are the exhaustion of *Yi*; when Qian and Kun are arrayed, *Yi* is established within them," the *Yi* characters all share this meaning. Furthermore, the claim that Fuxi’s time lacked the *Yi* character is incorrect. The *Rites of Zhou* states that the Grand Diviner oversees the methods of the Three *Yi*: the first is *Lianshan*, the *Yi* of Xia; the second is *Guicang*, the *Yi* of Shang; the third is *Zhou Yi*. The Three Dynasties all used *Yi* in their titles, continuing from the Sage Fuxi. Though Xia and Shang had different names, their use of *Yi* did not deviate from the Sage Fuxi. The diviners of old used eight bamboo slips to divine the eight odes, employing the Eight Trigrams to prognosticate fortune and misfortune. The milfoil diviners managed the Three *Yi* to distinguish the names of the nine milfoil divinations. It was not only in the Zhou that the name *Yi* was established. If Fuxi’s time had no writing and thus no *Yi* character, then the Two Modes, Four Images, Qian, Kun, Gen, Xun, Zhen, Li, Kan, Dui, the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six, the division of milfoil stalks, the "two suspended, one set aside" method—all would be later additions. If Fuxi and Taihao were merely posthumous titles with no substance, and the hexagram texts were entirely the work of divine sages, then to rely solely on later generations for the name *Yi* would be to diminish the Sage Fuxi to an extreme.

This misconception arises because Confucius "made the *Yi*," and the character *Yi* was created, leading to such claims. Yet they fail to recognize that when Confucius spoke of "making the *Yi*," he referred to making the *Zhou Yi*, not the Three *Yi*, nor the complete *Yi* of Fuxi. The subsequent text—"Did he have concerns? Was it about King Wen and Zhou’s affairs?"—makes his intent quite clear. The details have already been discussed in the preface.

The Supreme Polarity...

The *ji* (极) is the ridgepole of a house. *Tai* (太) signifies "utmost greatness." Han Kangbo’s commentary states: "That which exists begins with the primordial, thus the Supreme Polarity generates the Two Modes." The Supreme Polarity is a designation for the primordial; it cannot be named, and so we take the utmost of existence and term it the Supreme Polarity. Kong Yingda’s subcommentary says: "The Supreme Polarity refers to the time before Heaven and Earth divided, when primordial *qi* was blended as one—this is the Grand Beginning, the Supreme Oneness." Thus Laozi says, "The Dao gives birth to the One," and this One is the Supreme Polarity. Further, once the primordial chaos divided, Heaven and Earth emerged, hence "the Supreme Polarity generates the Two Modes," which is what Laozi means by "the One gives birth to the Two." It does not speak of Heaven and Earth but of the Two Modes, referring to their physical forms. Below, they correspond to the Four Images, hence they are called the Two Modes, meaning the two embodied forms.

Zhu Xi’s *Original Meaning* states: "The One invariably generates the Two—this is the natural principle." The *Yi* concerns the transformations of yin and yang; the Supreme Polarity is its principle. Zhuo says: Kangbo and Yingda adopted the doctrines of Laozi and Zhuangzi to explain the *Yi*, and their theories are certainly not worth refuting. Yet if we follow their reasoning, the Dao generates Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth then generate Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, and from these the eight trigrams on the milfoil stalks emerge—is this not preposterous? If we adhere to Master Zhu’s explanation, then the transformations of yin and yang, along with the principle underlying them, at the very outset generate the first two lines on the stalks. The first two lines then generate the next four, and these four generate the subsequent eight, without distinguishing between greater and lesser undifferentiated yin and yang. Only when divided into two lines do greater and lesser distinctions emerge, and yin and yang then form the images of the Three Powers. Yet if the first line of yin and yang entirely lacks distinction between greater and lesser, how can the upper line of the eight trigrams fully encompass the Way of Heaven, the Way of Earth, and the Way of Man? This is undoubtedly a matter of no small doubt.

**The Two Modes**
Earlier scholars say: When the Sage Fuxi drew the trigrams, he first made one unbroken line (⚊) to symbolize yang and one broken line (⚋) to symbolize yin, which later generations named the Two Modes. Zhuo says: Five. Throughout the Ten Wings, whenever Confucius speaks, he only says that Fuxi first created the eight trigrams, never that Fuxi first created the Two Modes. Where in which *Classic* or which *Wing* does it say that Fuxi first made one unbroken line to symbolize yang and one broken line to symbolize yin? In which passage of the *Classic* or which chapter of the *Wings* does this appear? In the horizontal diagram, the eight trigrams branch into sixty-four. The circular and square diagrams are the same. The annotations beneath the trigrams say "such-and-such trigram below, such-and-such trigram above," never stating that the first unbroken and broken lines divide into four, then eight, then sixteen, then thirty-two, and finally sixty-four. The six lines of each trigram are uniform in length, breadth, and spacing. If we now take the first unbroken and broken lines and view the Four Images as requiring division into two segments, the eight trigrams into four, the sixteen into eight, the thirty-two into sixteen, and the sixty-four into thirty-two, then without such division, yang, with its single unbroken line, would bear the weight of the thirty-two lines above, and yin, with its single broken line, would bear the weight of the thirty-two lines above—clearly an incommensurable comparison. If one claims the Two Modes are divinely subtle, that a single line can transform its form to match the number above, then the Sage left no such explicit statement. If we insist this diagram is correct, then the Sage’s horizontal, circular, and square diagrams should all truncate the first line of the sixty-four trigrams. If we still follow the Sage’s original sixty-four-trigram diagrams, then this diagram is not the Sage’s method of drawing.

**The Four Images**
Earlier scholars added one unbroken or broken line above each of the four combinations of unbroken and broken lines, making four lines in total to symbolize the old and young of yin and yang. Zhuo says: It is correct to call old yin, old yang, young yin, and young yang the Four Images, but it is incorrect to say the Four Images reside above the first line of the eight trigrams and below the three lines. The character *yi* (仪) in "Two Modes" follows the *hu* (户, "door") from the earlier phrase "closing and opening doors," meaning the two doors match each other. The *xiang* (象, "image") in "Four Images" follows the *xiang* from the earlier phrase "what is seen is called an image," for only now do images manifest in the lines. Seven symbolizes young yang, eight young yin, nine old yang, and six old yin—hence the Four Images. Confucius says, "The *Yi* has Four Images to show [the way]," meaning only now do line images appear to indicate to people gains and losses, movement and stillness, and thus divination for good or ill fortune, regret or remorse. Otherwise, why speak of "what is seen is called an image," and why would the Four Images alone be called "what is shown"? If we insist on fixing them in the second position, then *Qian* and *Dui* would precisely correspond to old yang, *Li* and *Zhen* to young yin, *Kun* and *Gen* to old yin, and *Xun* and *Kan* to young yang. In the *Yi* of the Sage Fuxi, the old changes while the young does not, so if we examine the method of seeking trigrams in the *Zuozhuan* across the Three Dynasties, *Qian* should change into *Li* as its derived trigram, *Dui* into *Zhen*, while *Xun* and *Li* alone retain their original trigrams. Why? Because young yin does not change. Thus the original trigrams of *Qian* and *Dui* transform through yielding to the firm, while *Zhen* and *Li* not only retain their original trigrams but also gain derived trigrams, leaving no single *Qian* or *Dui* but only doubled *Zhen* and *Li*. *Kun* should change into *Kan* as its derived trigram, *Gen* into *Xun*, while *Xun* and *Kan* alone retain their original trigrams.

Why? Because young yang does not change. Thus the original trigrams of *Kun* and *Gen* transform through the firm yielding to the yielding, while *Xun* and *Kan* not only retain their original trigrams but also gain derived trigrams, leaving no single *Kun* or *Gen* but only doubled *Xun* and *Kan*. With *Qian*, *Dui*, *Kun*, and *Gen* lost while *Zhen*, *Li*, *Xun*, and *Kan* doubled, the four images give rise to four trigrams—how then can one speak of them generating the eight trigrams?

Earlier scholars took a single yang line atop another as pure yang, thus symbolizing old yang. A single yang line atop a yin line, with yin mingled within yang, symbolized young yin. A single yin line atop a yang line, with yang mingled within yin, symbolized young yang. Two yin lines atop one another, pure yin, symbolized old yin. This was to evade the difficulty of old changing while young does not. Yet they failed to realize that if a single yang line atop another or a single yin line atop another—pure yin and yang—are specially called "old," then what should one call a hexagram with six pure lines? Would these not become "supreme old yin" and "supreme old yang"? Such arguments, lacking precision and seeking only momentary satisfaction, are of no value to me.

**The Eight Trigrams**
The Master said that Fuxi first created the eight trigrams. In Fuxi’s trigrams, the lower position of *Qian* is yang, yet he never stated: "The first line of *Qian*’s lower trigram shares a single yang line with *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*." Nor did he say: "The second line of *Qian*’s lower trigram shares a single yang line with *Dui*." Likewise, for *Kun*’s lower trigram, he never said: "The first line of *Kun*’s lower trigram shares a single yin line with *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun*," nor: "The second line of *Kun*’s lower trigram shares a single yin line with *Gen*." Nor did he ever say: "Only the third line of *Qian*’s lower trigram attains a complete yang line, distinct from the first and second lines’ truncated forms." Nor: "Only the third line of *Kun*’s lower trigram attains a complete yin line, distinct from the first and second lines’ truncated forms." The same applies to the lower trigrams of the other six hexagrams. Thus, the first, second, and third lines—whether long, short, broad, or narrow—are uniform across all, and only then can they be called the eight trigrams. If the first line is shared by four trigrams as two lines, or by two trigrams with varying lengths, breadths, or forms, this cannot be called the eight trigrams. How could this not clearly deviate from the Sage’s method?

**Sixteen Lines**
Earlier scholars claimed that "one generates two" is the natural principle, so each trigram’s top should also add one yin and one yang line, resulting in sixteen lines. Yet the Master never made such a statement. Not only did he never say this, but immediately after discussing the eight trigrams, he followed with words on determining fortune and misfortune. Tracing backward from his words on fortune and misfortune determined by the eight trigrams, one realizes that the four images generate not only the inner eight trigrams but also the outer eight trigrams. Only after the four images generate these inner and outer eight trigrams can one speak of the "ten changes that complete the hexagrams"—not merely generating the inner eight trigrams as a minor achievement. Only then can fortune and misfortune be determined. Viewed thus, the fourth, fifth, and top lines of the doubled trigrams are already fully present in the phrase "the four images generate the eight trigrams." Though one might wish to double the eight trigrams to sixteen lines, there is no place to pause in between. Yet Shaozi’s claim that "eight divides into sixteen" is a baseless elaboration the Master never uttered—how recklessly unfounded!

**Thirty-Two Lines**
Since the fourth, fifth, and top lines of the doubled trigrams are fully present in "the four images generate the eight trigrams," the Master never spoke of thirty-two lines. For him to have left such a statement unspoken would be an unwarranted elaboration. Thus, Shaozi’s claim that "sixteen divides into thirty-two" is clearly unreliable. Alas! Even if his words did not contradict Fuxi’s method or deviate from the Master’s intent, they would still be tolerable. Yet when examined, his claim that the outer trigrams’ four lines are quadruple the inner trigrams’ three lines—adding the outer eight trigrams’ five lines to the inner trigrams’ three lines to make twenty-four, while the inner trigrams’ three lines are truncated by the outer trigrams’ four and five lines—also corresponds to Fuxi’s horizontal square-circle diagram. In the six-line form, length, shortness, breadth, and narrowness show no difference between inner and outer. When does the doubling occur? When does the truncation happen? And when does the addition align with the three circles? Does this not also contradict Fuxi’s method? The Master’s intent was that both inner and outer eight trigrams arise from the four images, hence his words: "The eight trigrams determine fortune and misfortune." Now, inserting the generation of sixteen and thirty-two lines between the eight trigrams and the determination of fortune and misfortune—absent from the Master’s explicit text and forcibly interpolated—does this not also deviate from his intent? Neither Fuxi’s method nor Confucius’s intent, such claims are decisively unworthy of adherence.

**Sixty-Four Lines**
This refers to the top line of the six-line hexagrams, as described in the Song scholars’ diagrams of hexagram generation. Though this single line exists in all sixty-four hexagrams—neither excessive here nor deficient there—if taken as a division of thirty-two lines, it also departs from Fuxi’s method and rebels against the Master’s intent. For in Fuxi’s sixty-four hexagrams, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top lines are all uniform. To claim that the fifth line generates odd and even lines to form the sixth line in sixty-four hexagrams may hold, but from this sixth line downward, the fifth line truncates thirty-two, the fourth line truncates forty-eight, the third line truncates fifty-six, the second line truncates sixty, and the first line truncates sixty-two. Once the earlier scholars’ theory of hexagram generation emerged, it left the five lines below the sixth without proper place, inevitably fragmenting and distorting them. How could this be the Sage’s method or the Great Mean’s intent?

Now, returning to antiquity and rectifying heterodox theories, we may hope to avoid becoming an encumbrance to the Sage. Thus, we re-present the diagrams and explanations below to clarify Fuxi’s original method and the Master’s original intent.

**Fuxi’s Hexagram-Generating Diagram from the *Gu Yi Kao Yuan***

The *Yi* is the work of six sages. Its origins lie with Fuxi, who first drew the eight trigrams. By appending each of the eight trigrams above the eight, he thereby differentiated them into sixty-four hexagrams.

Three lines form Fuxi’s *qian* trigram. When three additional lines are appended externally—annotated as *qian* below and *qian* above—it remains named *qian*. The other seven trigrams follow the same pattern, constituting the eight primary hexagrams. When *dui* is appended above *qian*, it can neither be named *qian* nor *dui*, and is thus called *guai*. This is one of *qian*’s derivations. *Qian* has eight such derivations, and the other seven trigrams likewise each produce eight, yielding sixty-four derivative hexagrams in total.

The names of the sixty-four hexagrams were first devised by Fuxi as written characters; their appellations were first voiced by Fuxi as sounds. Over successive eras and sages, none dared alter the brushstrokes, forms, or contemporary pronunciations of Fuxi’s sacred script. Fuxi’s script, like the founding ancestor of a clan whose descendants branch into countless generations without end—

The sages of Xia and Shang were Yu and Tang; those of Zhou were King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius. Through their mutual elucidations, Fuxi’s classic endured across the ages, and the contributions of these five sages were immense. Yet each composed their works based on their own insights, so their books sometimes begin with *gen*, sometimes with *kun*, and sometimes with *qian*. The Duke of Zhou and Confucius, however, fully adhered to the *Zhouyi* and expounded upon it.

Fuxi’s *Yi* is simple yet subtly profound, embracing the literary traditions of the Three Dynasties. The classics of the Three Dynasties are vast and mystically profound, mutually illuminating Fuxi’s classic. Fuxi’s classic may be likened to the primal qi of Great Harmony flowing through the four seasons, while the Three Dynasties resemble spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each specializing in its own season.

**The Xia *Yi***
Kongzi said: In ancient times, there was the Lianshan clan. The Xia *Yi* is now called *Lianshan*, likely adopting the *Yi* of the Lianshan clan. An ancient commentary states: *Lianshan* symbolizes clouds rising from mountains in unbroken succession. I find this annotation inappropriate. The original text contains no such wording—how could it speak of "unbroken succession"? The *Daxiang* of *Gen* says "composite mountains," yet how can *gen* be said to combine mountains and clouds? *Gen* represents mountains, a symbol established since Fuxi’s time. The Xia *Yi* begins with *gen*, hence it takes the doubled mountain hexagram—*gen* below and *gen* above—still named *gen*, thus called *Lianshan*. Internally there is a mountain, and externally another mountain, connected without end. To add "rising clouds" would introduce a separate meaning, deviating from the orthodox interpretation. The *Daxiang*’s "composite mountains" aligns with *Lianshan* in principle.

Of the Xia *Yi*, only its name, its book, and its commencement with *gen* remain discernible; the sequence of its sixty-four hexagrams is now entirely unattestable.

Zhuo said: The *Yi* states: "To delve into the profound and probe the hidden, to draw forth the distant and determine the world’s fortune or misfortune, to bring about the world’s undertakings—nothing surpasses milfoil and tortoiseshell." The subsequent passage concludes with "the River brought forth the Diagram, the Luo brought forth the Writing, and the sages took them as models." Clearly, Fuxi modeled the diagrams to cast milfoil stalks and the writings to perform tortoiseshell divination.

When the divine Yu governed the waters, the Luo again brought forth writings, which Yu employed to arrange the Nine Categories. Thus, the seven milfoil stalks Fuxi modeled for divination appear in the *Jiyi* section on "Investigating Doubts," while the seven tortoiseshells he modeled for oracle-bone divination appear in the same section’s "Divination and Selection." Establishing diviners, he commanded them: "Rain, clearing, haze, or dawn—divine fivefold." Establishing milfoil casters, he commanded them: "Inquiry and regret—use two for divination." Fearing that a single diviner or milfoil caster might err without means of correction, he multiplied their numbers, enabling mutual verification of mistakes. Thus, he appointed three diviners and three milfoil casters as officials, each employing distinct methods. If all three divinations were auspicious, or all inauspicious, that result was adopted. If one was inauspicious and two auspicious, the auspicious result was used; if one was auspicious and two inauspicious, the inauspicious result was used. Hence it is said: "In divination, follow the word of two."

The *Neizhuan* states: "Its *zhen* is wind, its *hui* is mountain," meaning the inner hexagram is *zhen* and the outer hexagram is *hui*. It also says: "Eight *zhen* are *zhun*, *hui* are *yu*," meaning the original hexagram is *zhen* and the derived hexagram is *hui*. The *Zhouyi* says: "Favorable for divination," "Unfavorable for divination," "May be divined," "Divining illness," and phrases like "regret vanishes" or "its regret then vanishes"—all derive from this. These are but Fuxi’s methods, later flourishing in the Three Dynasties.

**The Shang *Yi***
Kongzi said: In ancient times, there was the Guicang clan. The Shang *Yi* is now called *Guicang*, likely adopting the *Yi* of the Guicang clan. *Guicang* signifies that the myriad things return to their roots and restore their destinies, all concealed within the earth. *Kun* represents earth, so *guicang* is the Dao of earth.

Thus, its text begins with *Kun*. The *Shuogua* states, "*Kun* conceals them"—this confirms it. Of the Shang *Yi*, only these two aspects remain discernible: its name and its commencement with *Kun*. The sequence of its sixty-four hexagrams can no longer be verified. However, in the *Liyun*, Confucius tells Ziyou: "The order of *Kun* and *Qian*..."—one may infer that its sequence began with *Kun* followed by *Qian*. King Wen, however, deemed *Kun* unfit to precede *Qian*, so he placed *Qian* first and *Kun* second. As for the subsequent hexagram order, further investigation remains elusive. Yet if only the positions of *Kun* and *Qian* were transposed without altering their paired structure, then their binary couplings might still align with the *Zhouyi*, though the precise sequence and proximity could not have been entirely identical.

In the *Zhouyi*, *Tai*’s sixth line five reads: "Di Yi marries off his younger sister—auspicious and supremely fortunate." *Mingyi*’s sixth line five states: "Jizi’s *mingyi*—favorable for divination." *Guimei*’s sixth line five says: "Di Yi marries off his younger sister—the lord’s sleeve, unaware of her sister’s sleeve." *Gen* and *Jiji*’s ninth line three: "King Gaozong campaigns against Guifang, conquering it in three years." *Weiji*’s ninth line four: "Zhen is used to campaign against Guifang, rewarded after three years by a great state." Former scholars believed these lines were cited because they had once been divined, hence their inclusion.

I, Nu, note: The *Zhouli*’s *Taibu* oversees the three methods of milfoil divination: first, jade milfoil; second, tile milfoil; third, plain milfoil. Their milfoil forms are all "chou," totaling four hundred and twenty, with accompanying odes numbering one thousand two hundred. It also governs the three *Yi* systems: first, *Lianshan*; second, *Guicang*; third, *Zhouyi*. Each system’s primary trigrams number eight, with sixty-four derivative hexagrams. The *Dayi*’s assertion that "nothing surpasses tortoise and milfoil" is thus exemplified.

However, Fuxi’s hexagram sequence begins with *Qian*, followed by *Dui*, *Li*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun*, with its sixty-four hexagrams arranged accordingly. The Xia *Yi* begins with *Gen*, but its sequence is unverifiable. The Shang *Yi* begins with *Kun*, yet its sequence is likewise lost. Whether its hexagrams followed the primary trigrams remains unknown.

The *Dengren* oversees the three *Yi* systems to distinguish nine divination methods: first, *shigeng*; second, *shixian*; third, *shishi*; fourth, *shimu*; fifth, *shiyi*; sixth, *shihua*; seventh, *shici*; eighth, *shican*; ninth, *shihuan*—each employed to discern fortune and misfortune. For major state affairs, milfoil divination precedes tortoise-shell divination, conducted in early spring. All state matters involve divination.

All divination methods originate from Fuxi’s primordial milfoil. Round milfoil divination seeks the square hexagrams of knowing; the *Yi*’s hexagrams and lines all adhere to Fuxi’s primordial milfoil. When milfoil emerges from its case and is grasped in hand, it is called "closing the door." Dividing it evenly by hand, suspending the excess, and returning the remainder is called "opening the door." One closing and one opening constitute a *bian*; three *bian* form a line. Nine *bian* achieve a minor completion, casting the inner hexagram. Eighteen *bian* complete the full hexagram, after which the outer hexagram is added. The lines formed by three *bian*—whether seven, eight, nine, or six—are called the four images. If seven or eight are obtained, the inner hexagram is *zhen* and the outer is *hui*; if nine or six are obtained, the original hexagram is *zhen* and the derived hexagram is *hui*. Divination follows the interpretations of two diviners: some results align, some are auspicious, some favor tortoise over milfoil (inner auspicious, outer inauspicious), some oppose both tortoise and milfoil (quiescence auspicious, action inauspicious). Their adherence to the Xia system while following Fuxi’s method is thus evident.

The *Zhouyi*’s King Wen hexagram sequence and the Duke of Zhou’s hexagram transformations:
The first thirty hexagrams of the upper canon, excluding *Qian* and *Li*’s six lines, leave twelve hexagrams. The thirty-four hexagrams of the lower canon, excluding *Zhongfu*, *Xiaoguo*, *Jiji*, and *Weiji*, leave thirty hexagrams, which are inverted to form fifteen hexagrams.

Zhuo remarks: Confucius’ *Xiang* commentaries on "coming and going," "ascending and descending," "advancing and retreating" all stem from King Wen’s single statement in *Tai* and *Pi*: "The small departs, the great arrives" and "The great departs, the small arrives." King Wen adopted Fuxi’s hexagram sequence but rearranged it into binary pairs. Observing these paired hexagrams in inversion, *Tai* has three yang lines inside and three yin lines outside, while *Pi* has three yin lines inside and three yang lines outside. The inner lines, coming from without, are called "arriving"; the outer lines, departing from within, are called "departing." Confucius expanded this, stating that when the firm ascends and the yielding descends, the firm lines are indeed above and the yielding below, and vice versa. All these observations arise from comparing paired hexagrams to discern their forms—not by transforming one hexagram into another or altering lines between them. If that were the case, it would mistakenly conflate the young yin and yang (seven and eight) with the old yin and yang (nine and six)—would this not be a grave error?

Moreover, King Wen and Confucius did not discuss "coming and going" or "ascending and descending" in the eight pure hexagrams or non-inverted pairs, making their original intent abundantly clear. *Tai* states: "The small departs, the great arrives." *Pi* states: "The great departs, the small arrives." These are the first instances of "coming and going" in hexagram statements. Confucius further expanded this to include "ascending and descending," "advancing and retreating," all derived from these principles. Yet neither King Wen nor Confucius equated *Tai*’s departing three yin lines with *Pi*’s arriving three yin lines, nor *Tai*’s arriving three yang lines with *Pi*’s departing three yang lines.

Viewing the two hexagrams in their inverted opposition, what moves outward is called "departing," while what enters inward is called "arriving"—nothing more. If one were to claim that this year’s three yang lines are the same as last year’s three yang lines of the first month, or that this year’s three yin lines are the same as last year’s three yin lines of the seventh month, it would imply that heaven and earth contain only this single *qi*, stored in one place and awaiting its time to emerge or withdraw, with no continuous renewal. Has such a principle ever existed from ancient times to the present?

Consider *Tai* evolving from *Guimei*: the sixth line departs to the fourth position, while the ninth line arrives at the third. Or *Pi* evolving from *Jian*: the ninth line departs to the fourth position, while the sixth line arrives at the third. This interpretation not only imposes the mutability of lines upon the stability of the hexagram’s structure but also subtly alters King Wen’s "three small" and "three great" by reducing them to a single small and a single great line. How can this align with the concurrent truths of the sacred scriptures?

*Xu* occupies the celestial position with correctness and centrality. The celestial position is the fifth; viewed through its opposition with *Song*, it attains both correctness and centrality. *Song* states: "The firm arrives and attains the center." Viewed through its opposition with *Xu*, it attains correctness and centrality, yet here it attains only centrality, not correctness. Master Zhu said: *Song* arises from *Zhu*, and among the fourteen hexagrams that emerge from *Zhu*, *Song* is the first to transform—its firm line arrives at the second position, while the yielding line advances to the third. Mr. Qiu stated: This is the beginning of hexagram transformation as described in the *Tuan* commentary.

Some mistakenly believe that the central line of *Kan* departs to the fifth position, while the correct and central line arrives at the second, thus attaining centrality. Is this not straightforward and simple? *Sui* states: "The firm arrives and submits to the yielding; movement brings joy—this is *Sui*." The *Benyi* explains: It arises from *Kun*, where the ninth line arrives at the first position, and from *Shihe*, where the ninth line arrives at the fifth. The version derived from *Jiji* combines these two transformations, both embodying the principle of the firm following the yielding. *Gu* states: "The firm ascends while the yielding descends; compliance and stillness—this is *Gu*." Master Xun said: It arises from *Bi*, *Jing*, and *Jiji*, where the firm ascends and the yielding descends—these are all transformed hexagrams.

Master Zhuo said: Viewing the two hexagrams in opposition, the firm line ascending in *Gu* comes from without, initially descending to the second and third positions, while the yielding line follows the initial firm line, ascending from below. The yielding line at the top descends from above. Earlier scholars further encapsulated this with the six children, claiming that the first line of *Pi* exchanges with the top line of *Sui*, and the first line of *Tai* exchanges with the top line of *Gu*—this is even more erroneous.

*Shihe* states: "The yielding attains the center and ascends." Earlier scholars believed it transforms from *Pi*, with the line ascending from the first to the fifth position—this is incorrect. *Bi* states: "The yielding arrives and adorns the firm; the firm is divided and ascends to adorn the yielding." Some claim it transforms from *Tai*, with *Tai*’s firm lines ascending—this is also incorrect. Master Zhuo said: The division of firm and yielding refers to the separation where the firm ascends to the yielding.

The hexagram’s text speaks of the yielding line at the fifth position of *Li*, while the subsequent hexagram speaks of the yielding lines at the second and fifth positions—though both attain centrality, the second also attains correctness, making it especially esteemed. *Yu* states: "The firm comes from without and becomes master within." Some claim it transforms from *Zhu* through three changes—this is incorrect. *Daxu* states: "The firm ascends and esteems worthiness." Some claim it transforms from *Dazhuang*, with the fourth line ascending and descending—this is also incorrect. Master Zhuo said: The firm line of *Yu* comes from the top of *Daxu* to become the master within at the first position, while the firm line of *Daxu* ascends from the first position of *Yu* to esteem worthiness—this is understood through opposition and symbolic reflection.

The lower images:
*Xian* states: "The yielding ascends while the firm descends." Some claim it transforms from *Pi*—this is incorrect. *Heng* states: "The firm ascends while the yielding descends." Some claim it transforms from *Tai*—this is also incorrect. Master Zhuo said: This interpretation, derived from oppositional reflection, is exceedingly clear.

*Jin* states: "Compliance and attachment to great brightness; the yielding advances and ascends." Some claim it transforms from *Guan*, with the fourth line advancing to the fifth—this is incorrect. *Mingyi*, *Jiaren*, and *Kui* state: "Joy and attachment to brightness; the yielding advances and ascends." Some claim it transforms from *Xun*, with the fourth line advancing to the fifth—this is also incorrect. Master Zhuo said: All four hexagrams contain the *Li* trigram, where the yielding line advances and ascends, while the joyful line retreats and descends. This reflects the sage’s emphasis on brightness. Such interpretations, derived from the opposition of these four hexagrams, are most worthy of deep contemplation.

*Jian* states: "Favorable in the southwest, where one attains the center by departing. Unfavorable in the northeast, where the Way is exhausted. Favorable to see the great person, as departing brings achievement." Some claim the first line of *Zhen* exchanges with the fifth, and the fourth with the third—this is baseless. *Xie* states: "Favorable in the southwest, where one attains the multitude by departing. Returning brings good fortune, as it attains the center. Having somewhere to go, early good fortune brings achievement." Some claim the top line of *Gen* exchanges with the second, and the second with the top—this is equally unfounded. Master Zhuo said: This is also quite clear.

*Sun* states: "Diminishing below to augment above—its Way ascends." Some claim it transforms from *Tai*, with the third line ascending—this is incorrect. *Yi* states: "Diminishing above to augment below—descending from above." Some claim it transforms from *Pi*, with the fourth line descending to the first—this is also incorrect. Master Zhuo said: Diminishing below to augment above is *Sun*; diminishing above to augment below is *Yi*. The two hexagrams are inversions of each other, their words clear and their meanings profound. What connection do they have with transformations from *Tai* or *Pi*?

*Cui* states: "Gathering. Compliance and joy; the firm is central and responsive—thus gathering." *Sheng* states: "The yielding ascends in due time; compliance and submission, the firm central and responsive—thus great success." Master Zhang said: The yielding refers to the sixth line at the fourth position. Master Xu said: The second line of *Xie* ascends to become the fourth line, illustrating Confucius’ statement about the yielding ascending. Yet it speaks only of the fourth line’s single change, while the fifth and top lines are not mentioned as ascending—how can this so distort the scriptures and contradict the sage? If one further insists on interpreting the hexagram through its lines, it would be as absurd as failing to distinguish beans from wheat.

Then why does the scripture not mention "the yielding descends in due time"? It is said: Ascending is emphasized, while descending is not belabored.

The sage thus perfects others’ goodness to such an extent—this aligns with *Mingyi* and *Jiaren*. The *Comprehensive Hexagram Transformation Diagram* represents the Duke of Zhou’s "use of nine" and "use of six." Through this, one hexagram can transform into sixty-four. When none of the six lines change, the hexagram’s original lines may only be called "lines," as in the *Yi*’s formation of hexagrams through six lines. The original transformations are limited to seven: original nine, eight, and six—hence the term "original transformation."

King Wen established the hexagrams, observed their images, and appended judgments below—this is the foundation of *Yi* learning. Earlier scholars also claimed that one hexagram could transform into sixty-four, which is mistaken. Only when the milfoil stalks yield either nine or six does a line acquire the name *yao*, and only then does transformation occur.

When one line changes, six hexagrams result, all illustrated below through the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*. The remaining sixty-two hexagrams can be inferred accordingly:
- Six changes: *Guai* and *Bo*
- Five changes: *Dayou* and *Bi*
- Four changes: *Xiaoxu* and *Yu*
- Three changes: *Lü* and *Qian*
- Two changes: *Tongren* and *Shi*
- Initial change: *Gou* and *Fu*

When the stalks yield nine, the firm will transform into the yielding; when they yield six, the yielding will transform into the firm—thus the term "initial transformation," referring to the first nine or first six. Take *Qian* and *Kun* as examples:
- *Qian*’s *Gou* and *Kun*’s *Fu* (initial change)
- Nine in the second: *Qian*’s *Tongren*; six in the second: *Kun*’s *Shi*
- Nine in the third: *Qian*’s *Lü*; six in the third: *Kun*’s *Qian*
- Nine in the fourth: *Qian*’s *Xiaoxu*; six in the fourth: *Kun*’s *Yu*
- Nine in the fifth: *Qian*’s *Dayou*; six in the fifth: *Kun*’s *Bi*
- Top nine: *Qian*’s *Guai*; top six: *Kun*’s *Bo*

The sixty-two remaining hexagrams follow this pattern.

In the Duke of Zhou’s *Appended Judgments*:
- When two lines change, fifteen hexagrams result:
  - Initial and top change: *Daguo* and *Yi*
  - Initial and fifth change: *Ding* and *Zhun*
  - Initial and fourth change: *Xun* and *Zhen*
  - Initial and third change: *Song* and *Mingyi*
  - Initial and second change: *Dun* and *Lin*
  - Second and top change: *Ge* and *Meng*
  - Second and fifth change: *Li* and *Kan*
  - Second and fourth change: *Jiaren* and *Xie*
  - Second and third change: *Wuwang* and *Sheng*
  - Third and top change: *Dui* and *Gen*
  - Third and fifth change: *Gui* and *Jian*
  - Third and fourth change: *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo*
  - Fourth and top change: *Xu* and *Jin*
  - Fourth and fifth change: *Daxu*
  - Fifth and top change: *Dazhuang* and *Guan*

- When three lines change, twenty hexagrams result:
  - Initial, second, and top change: *Xian* and *Sun*
  - Initial, second, and fifth change: *Lü* and *Jie*
  - Initial, second, and fourth change: *Jian* and *Guimei*
  - Initial, second, and third change: *Pi* and *Tai*
  - Initial, third, and top change: *Kun*
  - Initial, third, and fifth change: *Weiji* and *Jiji*
  - Initial, third, and fourth change: *Heng* and *Feng*
  - Initial, fifth, and top change: *Huan* and *Yi*
  - Initial, fourth, and top change: *Jing* and *Shihe*
  - Initial, fourth, and fifth change: *Gu* and *Sui*
  - Second, third, and top change: *Sui* and *Gu*
  - Second, third, and fifth change: *Shihe* and *Jing*
  - Second, third, and fourth change: *Yi* and *Huan*
  - Second, fifth, and top change: *Feng* and *Heng*
  - Second, fourth, and top change: *Jiji* and *Weiji*
  - Second, fourth, and fifth change: *Kun*
  - Third, fifth, and top change: *Guimei* and *Jian*
  - Third, fourth, and top change: *Jie* and *Lü*
  - Third, fourth, and fifth change: *Sun* and *Xian*
  - Fourth, fifth, and top change: *Tai* and *Pi*

- When four lines change, fifteen hexagrams result:
  - Initial, third, fifth, and top change: *Xiaoguo* and *Sun*
  - Initial, second, fourth, and top change: *Jian* and *Gui*
  - Initial, second, fourth, and fifth change: *Gen* and *Dui*
  - Initial, second, third, and top change: *Cui* and *Xiaoxu*
  - Initial, second, third, and fifth change: *Jin* and *Xu*
  - Initial, second, third, and fourth change: *Guan* and *Dazhuang*
  - Initial, fourth, fifth, and top change: *Sheng* and *Wuwang*
  - Initial, second, fifth, and top change: *Xie* and *Jiaren*
  - Initial, third, fourth, and top change: *Kan* and *Li*
  - Initial, third, fourth, and fifth change: *Meng* and *Ge*
  - Second, fourth, fifth, and top change: *Mingyi* and *Song*
  - Second, third, fifth, and top change: *Zhen* and *Xun*
  - Second, third, fourth, and top change: *Zhun* and *Ding*
  - Second, third, fourth, and fifth change: *Dun* and *Daguo*
  - Third, fourth, fifth, and top change: *Lin* and *Dun*

- When five lines change, six hexagrams result:
  - Initial, third, fourth, fifth, and top change: *Shi* and *Tongren*
  - Initial, second, fourth, fifth, and top change: *Lü*
  - Initial, second, third, fifth, and top change: *Yu* and *Xiaoxu*
  - Initial, second, third, fourth, and top change: *Bi* and *Dayou*
  - Initial, second, third, fourth, and fifth change: *Bo* and *Guai*
  - Second, third, fourth, fifth, and top change: *Fu* and *Gou*

- When all six lines change, one hexagram results:
  - "Use of nine": *Qian* transforms into *Kun*
  - "Use of six": *Kun* transforms into *Qian*

The above, from the Duke of Zhou’s *Appended Judgments*, applies only to the two uses of *Qian* and *Kun*. Master Zhu said: One line changing yields six hexagrams; two lines, fifteen; three lines, twenty; four lines, fifteen; five lines, six; all six lines changing, one—totaling sixty-three, which, including the unchanging original hexagram, makes sixty-four. One hexagram transforms into sixty-four, and sixty-four hexagrams transform into four thousand ninety-six, as in Jiao Gan’s *Forest of Changes*.

When one line changes, divination relies on the original hexagram’s changing line. Master Wang said: The original hexagram’s line serves as the "persistence" (*zhen*) line, while the changing line serves as the "regret" (*hui*) line; both should be considered. When two lines change, divination relies on the original hexagram’s two changing lines, with the upper line as primary. Master Wang said: The first changing line should be taken as *zhen*, and the next changing line as *hui*, interpreted in two stages of fortune’s ebb and flow—proceed accordingly.

When three lines change, divination relies on both the original and transformed hexagrams. The *Tuan* judgment takes the original hexagram as *zhen* and the transformed hexagram as *hui*. However, the *Zhongci* cannot be used for divination; instead, the first changing line should be taken as *zhen*, and the latter two as *hui*, interpreted in three stages of fortune’s ebb and flow.

When four lines change, divination relies on the transformed hexagram, with the two unchanged lines taking the lower line as primary. When five lines change, divination relies on the transformed hexagram and its single unchanged line. Master Wang said: Both cases are correct—take the first changing line as *zhen* and the later changing lines as *hui*, interpreted in four or five stages of fortune’s ebb and flow.

Master Xia said: If a line does not change, how can its changing line’s judgment be used? The Duke of Zhou’s line judgments were originally composed for the changes of nine and six; they were not intended for the unchanging seven and eight. If the *Zhouyi* did not employ seven and eight, how could seven and eight usurp the judgments of nine and six? When all six lines change, *Qian* and *Kun* rely on their two uses, while the rest rely on the transformed hexagram.

The *Tuan* Commentary states: The hexagram judgments all pertain to seven and eight. Since these are unchanging lines, how can they be used to divine change? Only *Qian* and *Kun* may rely on their two uses.

Master Lü notes: Master Zhu relied on the *Zuozhuan*’s references to "the eighth line of *Gen*," as well as passages on *zhen*, *tun*, *hui*, and *yu*—all employing the term "eight"—to support this view. Some commentators argue that the *Zuozhuan* uses the *Xia* and *Shang* versions of the *Yi*, while those explicitly citing the *Zhouyi* clearly state so; however, this cannot be fully verified.

**Hexagram Rulers**
The repository of hexagram divination must have a governing line. For the twelve sovereign hexagrams:
- *Fu* and *Lin* take the first line as ruler;
- *Lin* and *Dun* take the second line;
- *Tai* and *Pi* take the third;
- *Dazhuang* and *Guan* take the fourth;
- *Guai* and *Bo* take the fifth;
- *Qian* and *Kun* take the top line.

For the six doubled trigrams:
- *Zhen* and *Xun* take the fourth line as ruler;
- *Kan* and *Li* take the fifth;
- *Gen* and *Dui* take the top line.

For the six combined trigrams:
- *Heng* and *Yi* take the first line as ruler;
- *Jiji* and *Weiji* take the second;
- *Xian* and *Sun* take the third.
For *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Dui* in their reversed or opposed forms:
- *Jie* and *Daguo* take the top line;
- *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo* take the fourth.
For combined hexagrams with opposition:
- *Sui* and *Gu* take the first line;
- *Jian* and *Guimei* take the third.
Hexagrams containing *Kan* or *Li* take the central line of *Kan* or *Li* as ruler.
- *Song*, *Kun*, *Jie*, *Huan*, *Meng*, *Shi*, *Tongren*, *Ge*, *Feng*, *Jiaren*, *Bi*, and *Mingyi* all take the second line as ruler;
- *Xu*, *Jie*, *Tun*, *Jing*, *Jian*, *Bi*, *Dayou*, *Gui*, *Shihe*, *Ding*, *Lü*, and *Jin* all take the fifth.

When *Zhen* or *Xun* governs, the fourth line of the original hexagram rules:
- *Yu* and *Xu* take the fourth line;
- *Sheng* and *Wuwang* take the first.

When *Gen* or *Dui* governs, the third line of the original hexagram rules:
- *Qian* and *Lü* take the third;
- *Shi* and *Daxu* take the top.

The judgment following *Kun*’s hexagram lines takes the top line as ruler.
- *Mingyi*’s *Nine in the First*: "The lord speaks."
- *Mingyi* takes the second line as ruler.
- *Gui*’s *Nine in the Second*: "Encountering the ruler in a narrow lane." *Gui* takes the third line as ruler.
- *Feng*’s *Nine in the First*: "Encountering its mate as ruler." *Nine in the Fourth*: "Encountering its ruler." *Feng* takes the second line as ruler.
- *Wuwang*: The firm comes from without to become ruler within. *Wuwang* takes the first line as ruler.

Master Zhuo said: In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, events within the state of Lu are recorded as "internal," while those of other states are "external," hence "we" refers to Lu. This is because the *Annals* takes Lu as its subject—examples include "the men of Qi, Song, and Chen attacked us," or "the Qi forces invaded our borders" and "buried our lady." The *Zhouyi* follows the same principle: whenever "I" appears in hexagram or line judgments, it refers to the hexagram’s ruler. The following instances are listed:

- *Meng*: "The youth seeks me, not I the youth." The second line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "I." The fifth line, *Gen*’s youngest son, is called "youth."
- *Xiaoxu*: "Dense clouds, no rain, from our western suburbs." The fourth line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "our."
- *Guan* *Six in the Third*: "Observing my life’s advance and retreat." The fourth line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "my." The third line’s movements determine advance and retreat, as *Xun* governs both.
- *Yi* *Initial Nine*: "Abandon your sacred tortoise, observe my chewing." The top line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "my." The first line, at the bottom, is unfit for nourishing others. Though it possesses innate wisdom (the tortoise), it remains hidden, yet still gazes upward. The top line, *Yi*’s "excessive" position, admires the lower line’s ability to nourish itself without arrogantly forsaking its own needs for others.
- *Yi* *Nine in the Fifth*: "Sincere and beneficent heart—ask not, supremely auspicious. Sincere in bestowing virtue upon me." The second line is the fifth’s proper correlate. The fifth, at the heart position, speaks of the second’s sincerity in enriching it—its auspiciousness is self-evident. Yet the second not only trusts the fifth but also sincerely bestows virtue upon the first line. The first line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "me." The second and fifth are distant correlates, hence "beneficent heart." The first line’s firmness is consumed by the second, and their proximity is close, hence "bestowed virtue." *Six in the Second* also speaks of receiving the fifth’s enrichment while gaining the first’s compliance, mirroring this line’s meaning—here, the focus is on the correlate’s relationship, including its adjacent line; there, the focus is on the second’s correlate, including *Six in the Second*’s proximity.
- *Jing* *Nine in the Third*: "The well is deep, unused—my heart aches." The fifth line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "my." The third line lies below *Dui*’s mouth, symbolizing a well’s purity left untouched. The fifth line’s heart aches in pity for its unused state.
- *Yi*’s fifth and third lines share virtue, but the fifth’s upper position lies above *Dui*’s mouth, where people draw from it. The third’s lower position lies below *Dui*’s mouth, unused by others—hence the fifth’s pity.
- *Ding* *Nine in the Second*: "The cauldron is full; my mate is ill, unable to approach me—auspicious." The fifth line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "my." This adopts the ruler’s voice: the second line’s virtue is full within, making it my proper correlate, my good match. Unfortunately, it suffers from imbalance, unable to come to me—how could I not visit it? A scholar does not bend the Way to seek an audience with a lord; humbling oneself to honor the worthy brings good fortune.
- *Lü* *Nine in the Fourth*: "My heart is not glad." The fifth line is the hexagram’s ruler, occupying the heart position, hence "my."

The fifth line of *Lǚ* resides in the fourth’s position, which is not its proper place—hence its heart is displeased.

- *Zhōng Fú* *Nine in the Second*: "I possess a fine vessel of rank; I share it with you, that we may dissolve it together." The fourth line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "I." It also uses "I" (*wu*), adopting the ruler’s voice: the second line, *Nine in the Fifth*, is firm, strong, centered, and correct, possessing the noble rank of Heaven within itself, above me. The fifth line pities and shares this with you, the second, who should look up to and remain devoted to it. The fourth is adjacent to the fifth, and the second and fifth share the same position—hence this address.

- *Xiǎo Guò* *Six in the Fifth*: "Dense clouds, no rain, from my western suburbs." The fourth line is the hexagram’s ruler, hence "my." *Nine in the Third* obscures the lower trigram *Kǎn* beneath the fifth, resembling clouds densely blocking yet failing to pass—hence no rain. The fourth is the west, lying outside the inner trigram—hence "suburbs." *Nine in the Fourth* does not ascend to join *Six in the Fifth*; how can it hope for the harmony of yin and yang to bring rain?

In the *Xiāntiān* diagram of sixty-four hexagrams, every two hexagrams mutually form one hexagram, so the middle layer’s thirty-two hexagrams mirror each other left and right, comprising sixteen distinct hexagrams. Within the middle layer’s thirty-two hexagrams, every two hexagrams again mutually form one hexagram, yielding sixteen hexagrams in the inner layer, divided into four identical groups—ultimately four hexagrams.

Master Hào states: Those who spoke of mutual trigrams in the past merely took four lines from six to form two hexagrams, without grasping the precision of their patterns and images. Now, observing the *Xiāntiān* diagram, the sixteen hexagrams formed by mutual trigrams are each obtained by skipping eight, condensing four into one. Starting from the left: *Qián* and *Guài* proceed through eight hexagrams to *Kuí* and *Guīmèi*, then through another eight to *Jiārén* and *Jìjì*, and yet another eight to *Yí* and *Fù*. Starting from the right: *Shēng* and *Dàguò* proceed through eight hexagrams to *Wèijì* and *Xiè*, then through another eight to *Jiàn* and *Jiǎn*, and yet another eight to *Bō* and *Kūn*. On each side, two hexagrams combine; three sets of two make sixty-four hexagrams, yet mutual trigrams form only sixteen, which further combine into four: *Qián*, *Kūn*, *Jìjì*, and *Wèijì*. The *Zhōu Yì* begins with *Qián* and *Kūn* and ends with *Jìjì* and *Wèijì*—is this not the reason?

Master Zhū states: In the middle layer, sixteen hexagrams lie on each side. Their lower trigrams, when paired, follow the sequence of *Qián* and *Kūn* through the eight hexagrams. Their upper trigrams complete two cycles of *Qián* and *Kūn* through the eight hexagrams—this can be discerned in the inner layer. The lower trigrams proceed in the order of *Qián*, *Lí*, *Kǎn*, *Kūn*, while the upper trigrams follow *Qián*, *Kǎn*, *Lí*, *Kūn*, with four cycles—this is especially worth contemplating.

Zhuó remarks: In the final chapter of the Master’s *Zá Guà*, eight hexagrams are selected from the middle layer: *Dàguò* and *Shēng* for their mutual formation of the inner layer’s *Qián*; *Yí* for its mutual formation of *Kūn*; *Jiàn* and *Jìjì* for their mutual formation of *Wèijì*; and *Guīmèi* and *Wèijì* for their mutual formation of *Jìjì*. *Qián* and *Kūn* are not selected, as they head the text. *Bō* and *Fù* are omitted due to their excess of yin. *Kuí* and *Xiè* are omitted because *Wèijì* and *Guīmèi* are already included. *Jiārén* and *Zòu* are omitted because *Jìjì* and *Jiàn* are already included. Three hexagrams are chosen for *Qián* due to its supremacy, while *Kūn* has only *Yí*; *Jìjì* has only *Guīmèi* and *Wèijì*; and *Wèijì* has only *Jiàn*. Since *Jìjì* and *Wèijì* appear at the end, this reflects the *Zhōu Yì*’s conclusion with *Jìjì* and *Wèijì*. *Kuí* and *Fù* conclude the *Zá Guà*’s sequence, following *Jìjì* and *Wèijì*. The names of the Xià, Shāng, and Zhōu dynasties are mixed yet not disordered; the Master’s naming is likewise mixed yet not disordered.
