**The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight, Fascicle One**

The Dao speaks: At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided in the Heaven of Great Purity, within the Palace of Pure Tenuity in the Land of Floating Radiance, upon the Jeweled Terrace of Jade Nets, emanating nine-colored auspicious lights. Upon a nine-petaled lotus throne, phoenixes sang and simurghs cried, lions and white cranes encircled, while the Thunder Generals of the Four Directions and all the heavens gathered round.

Formerly, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the fourth year of the Dragon Han era, the Earth Officials convened to deliberate the methods of the Southern Numinous Nether Calculations and the texts for delivering and rescuing beings. Before the Dao, the assembly expounded: the Great Emperor Ancestor of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder, the Great Emperor of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Spirits, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings, the Five Elders and Six Masters with the Four Sages, the True Lords of the Five Sacred Mountains, the Sage Emperors of the Five Marchmounts, the Source Kings of the Four Watercourses, the True Lords of the Five Celestial Granaries, the Eleven Great Luminaries, the Four Pillars of Destiny, the Four Directions’ Winding Deliverances, the Three Realms and Four Offices, the Heavenly Capital and Earthly Prisons, the Water Realms and Yang Ministries, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Three Officials and Great Emperors, the Four Ranks of Fire Officials, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors, the Three Origins and Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees, the City Gods and Village Altars, the Plague Bureaus of the Judiciary, the Five Lakes and Four Seas of the world, the Nine Rivers and Eight Waters, the Twelve River Sources, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Famous Mountains, the Eighteen Prisons of the Earthly Offices, the Twenty-Four Prisons of Fengdu, the Thirty-Six Prisons of Lady Qing, the Central Universal Torment, the Eighty-Four Thousand Layers of Ghostly Dungeons, the Great and Lesser Iron Enclosures, the Mountains of Swords and Lakes of Blood, the Gorges of Stone and Avīci Hell, the Ten Kings of the Nether Offices, the Two Hundred Twenty-Six Heavenly Kings, the Seventy Rakṣasī Women, the Twelve Jade Maidens of Incense Attendance, the Twenty-One Dragon Maidens, the Sixty-Four Māyā Women, the One Hundred Thirty Dragon Kings—each and all arrived to assemble. Bowing their heads in reverence, they paid homage, arrayed themselves in order, and stood in ranks to hear the proclamation of the scripture’s meaning.

Suddenly, a Heavenly Mother arrived, riding a peacock. In the Buddhist teachings, she is the Peacock Tathāgata; in the Dao, she is the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight. She gathered all the great benevolent deities of the Peacock Scripture to come and attend the Dharma-sound, take refuge in the Great Dao, and once more expound the numinous text of the Peacock’s virtue and power. She wished that within the Dao, she might resolve the calamities and hardships of all beings in the world.

At that time, the Peacock Radiant King circled thrice before the Heavenly Worthy and addressed him, saying: “We, the women of the two gates, today are fortunate to hear and behold your compassionate countenance expounding the scripture and Dharma. We beseech your deliverance and salvation. Whatever the ten entanglements, the karmic debts of three lifetimes, chronic illnesses and prolonged misfortunes, demonic specters and malevolent spirits, rebellious stars and constellations, curses and hexes, or all manner of disasters and misfortunes that afflict men and women in the world—if they but sincerely and reverently invite the good Dao, establish the scripture and Dharma in their homes, and perform the rites, all shall be dissolved. If their qi has not yet departed, they shall be spared from crossing over. Once the grievances of their karmic foes are resolved, they shall recover within three days. With pure body and mind, and fresh garments, they shall open the gates and announce to all the spirit shrines, specially summoning the soul and hastening the fate of so-and-so. They shall petition the Thunder Generals, receiving the talismanic commands of the Jade Purity and the august decrees of the Jade Emperor. Earnestly inviting Orthodox Unity Daoists—or three, five, or seven Daoist adepts—whether at home or in a Daoist abbey, they shall request the recitation of scriptures and repentances, light lamps, and perform the ritual circumambulation. Following the liturgical protocols in devotion, none shall fail to receive response. These are the wondrous words of the Heavenly Sovereign; all above shall act accordingly.”

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed the commands to the Thunder Lords of the Five Directions, the Thunder Kings of the Five Directions, the Cloud and Thunder Envoys of the Eight Directions, the Marshal Generals of the Thunder Department, and the Investigative Envoys of the Nine Heavens. Each issued orders and decrees, bowed their heads in reverence, took refuge, and pledged to obey.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke *The Scripture of the Peacock Radiant King, Spoken by the August Mother of the Jade Emperor, the Queen of Precious Moonlight*.

This scripture, in truth, is the marrow of the Great Cavern Scriptures, the transformative work within the scriptures, the application within the scriptures. For this reason, it was widely transmitted to the world below. Those who receive this Dharma-sound bow their heads to listen to the Dao.

Then, the great assembly again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “From of old, the Primordial Worthy bestowed it upon the August Mother of Precious Moonlight; the August Mother bestowed it upon the August Earth Queen, the Earthly Thearch; the Earthly Thearch bestowed it upon the Three Officials, Four Sages, and Five Elders of the Lofty Perfected; the Five Elders bestowed it upon the Five Masters; the Heavenly Master in turn bestowed it upon the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Great Compassionate and Great Ultimate Universal Assembly, the Azure Net Savior from Suffering and Universal Savior Perfected One, Lord Xu. It was transmitted down through the generations. At one time, the Perfected of Fixed Radiance propagated the wondrous canon, proclaimed the teachings and Dharma, and universally saved all men and women in the world. Should calamities arise, with sincere heart they may burn incense, present memorials and petitions, recite scriptures and perform repentances, submit sincerity and pledge devotion, offer fresh fruits of the season, invite the Dao and welcome the Perfected. With earnest devotion, they shall recite *The Venerable Scripture of the Peacock Great Radiant King*, and reverently pray. In a basin of water, they shall burn the petition for resolving calamities, dispatching it to the Controller of Destinies, sweeping away demonic influences, and receiving the response of blessings. There is none that shall not be spiritually efficacious. To save a single life in the world is to accumulate ten kinds of merit. Together, they shall amass hidden merit and jointly realize the non-action.”

This is the arcane and wondrous liturgy, the secret transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. If there are men and women in the world who, with sincere intent, proclaim and recite it to save beings, their fortune and longevity shall be boundless.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke a gāthā, saying:

*All voices chant in succession...*

The Sovereign of the Golden Portal and Mystic Vault,
The Most High Jade Emperor Supreme.
His wondrous form crowns all heavens,
His compassionate radiance illumines the Three Realms.
True Sage, Marvelous Dao, Merciful One,
Teacher upon whom gods and humans rely.
The Great Vehicle bestows the Dharma-word,
The Orthodox Unity points the lost to the Way.
His merit vast as empty space,
Praise of him knows no end.
All voices chant in unison.

Thereupon, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the hosts of heaven and earth, the Five Elders and Three Officials, the Four Sages and Ten Thousand Spirits, the Divine Mothers of the Perfected, and the sacred multitudes of Heavenly Mothers. According to the ritual, he transmitted the Five Directions’ Mandates, the True Writs and Divine Mantras, and the names of the Heavenly Kings, each to be recited in joint praise. May they ever grant protection, dispel calamity, and prolong life. May they propagate the Marvelous Dao and expound the numinous texts.

Recite.

This Jade Emperor’s Mandate is bestowed upon the Nine Qi Heavenly Kings of the East, commanding them to lead the Azure Emperor of their direction, the august and exalted Perfected Immortals and sacred hosts, to descend to the scripture altar and guard the Eastern Quarter.

For me, they shall provide protection and witness the merit of scripture recitation. May life span reach a hundred years, peace and joy extend with blessings. May calamity be dispelled, life prolonged, and great auspiciousness descend.

All [respond in unison].

The Dao speaks: This great divine incantation is the wondrous utterance of the Primordial Celestial King, the true revelation of the Jade Emperor Radiant King, the gateway of the Supreme Orthodox Unity, the primordial unity of the Nine Heavens’ inception—mysterious beyond mystery. The Most High Lord of the Dao broadly opens the gate of expedient means; the Dao possesses myriad subtle thresholds. Those who refuse to take refuge inevitably invite peril and misfortune. All fear death and devise countless schemes: some seek heterodox paths, slaughtering living beings; they shake bells to offer sustenance, ransoming souls and bargaining for life. Only when recovery remains incomplete do they finally take refuge—practicing the profound teachings of the scriptures, praising the Dipper and kindling lamps, performing rites of repentance and submitting memorials, reciting with sincere devotion. Within the Peacock Radiant Mother’s sutra reside the ten thousand spirits of the Four Palaces. Through single-minded devotion and cultivation, one may attain its response. Whatever is sought in teaching and transformation shall be granted, and gratitude for blessings received shall be duly offered.

Should any seek to enter this Daoist gate, first let them cultivate impartiality, free from stray thoughts. Arrange their ranks and temper their sharpness, then proceed to the Threefold Purity: first, purify the body from contention; second, purify the speech from contention; third, purify the mind. Further, eliminate the three karmic actions and six sensory roots—thus may one follow the laws of the Three Caverns. For aeons without end, they shall dwell in heaven, ever receiving the Five Fortunes, guarded by the hundred spirits.

When encountering the Three Primes, Five Offerings, four seasons, or eight solar terms—on one’s natal day or birth hour—within a purified chamber, burn incense and sit in silent meditation. Face the long-stemmed candle, bow deeply, and click the teeth. Recite this scripture, and longevity shall be attained. To preserve life and transcend calamity, the Middle Way Incantation for Prolonging Life and Longevity is spoken:

*Recite, and the earth transforms into blossoms.*
*The profound True Unity embodies the scripture, unfolding the texts of the Nine Heavens.*
*Soaring through the hosts of Tai Luo, the golden terrace’s courtier approaches the Sovereign.*
*Beyond suffering’s root, years endure like the sacred tree.*
*The hundred limbs radiate as jade flowers; devoutly I thank the White Prime Lord.*
*The Golden Terrace’s youths inscribe the cloud-mountain gate of true preservation.*
*Virtue and fortune renew with each day; the body’s light illumines the Three Heavens.*
*Purple canopies veil a thousand palaces; the heart takes refuge in the Supreme Honored One.*
*The Five Fortunes ever flow; the adept of the Mysterious is secretly shielded.*
*Demons are driven beyond the Eastern Sea, bearing the Great Radiance of the Void Emperor.*
*No refuge remains in the world—save the gates of hell.*
*Eternally free from ghostly karmic grubs, those who hear not the wondrous Dharma scriptures*
*How may they attain liberation? The Prime Lord commands the ghosts:*
*Suffer them not to harass living beings. Should they disobey my teaching,*
*Their heads shall shatter into seven fragments, never to know pardon.*
*For ten thousand kalpas, they shall not transcend rebirth. But those who take refuge in the Dao*
*Shall ascend to heaven, exhausting its blessings.*
*After five kalpas of cyclic transformation, good men and good women*
*Together shall receive a thousand springs of fortune.*
*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.*
*All [omitted character].*

The Dao speaks: All that is uttered at the conclusion of this scripture emanates from the myriad Celestial Emperors of Heaven. All kings and lands, all divine kings of heaven, and the divine healers of illness—all rejoice in boundless, everlasting fortune, attaining peace and bliss. Longevity flourishes, the teachings spread far and wide, and celestial blossoms scatter in profusion.

At that time, the great assembly, having heard this scripture, was filled with immense joy. They bowed in reverence, paid homage, and departed, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.

Here ends the first scroll of *The Venerable Scripture of the Radiant Moonlight Empress, Holy Mother of the Peacock Luminous King*, as expounded by the Supreme Primordial Heavenly Origin.

**Dedication, Repentance, and the Three Refuges**

We take refuge in the upper scroll of the scripture, which shields the realm and delivers the virtuous.
May all sentient beings universally take refuge in the Dao-Treasure, the Supreme Venerable.

We take refuge in the middle scroll of the scripture, whose recitation invokes the divine.
May all people in the world universally take refuge in the Scripture-Treasure, the Supreme Venerable.

We take refuge in the lower scroll of the scripture, wherein the phoenix-script holds all numinous texts.
May all who receive and uphold it universally take refuge in the Master-Treasure, the Supreme Venerable.

May all attain long life, each ascending in joy.
May all afflictions be extinguished, forever dispelled and never arise again.
We bow our heads in refuge to the Dao, together weaving this good cause,
To be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, as those who attend the Dragon-Flower Assembly.

With sincere faith, we bow to the Lord of the Great Dao of the Void Emperor,
Ancestor of the Three Teachings, Father of the Four Births,
He who transforms heaven and humankind,
Supreme Venerable Transmitting Master, who delivers the lost from drought and delusion.
Boundless in transformation, revered by ghosts and spirits,
Tamed are dragons and tigers, myriad virtues pervade the Dharma-realm,
Filling the ten directions.
Supreme is the Way, Primordial Ancestor of the Undifferentiated,
The scriptures may be set aside, yet the Mysterious Origin remains the Supreme Venerable.
We bow our heads to receive the sweet dew.

If one takes refuge in the *Peacock Scripture*,
True Teaching Master, the sins of bodily karma shall be dissolved.
We bow our heads in refuge to the Boundless Great Dao,
The highest good cause.
With sincere hearts, we chant the names of the Dao, the Scriptures, the Masters, and the Heavenly Worthies.

All respond: Inconceivable merit and virtue.

**Ritual Invocation for the Venerable Scripture of the Holy Mother Peacock Radiant King**

The Heavenly Worthy of Ever-Renewed Eternal Life.
*All respond in unison:*
Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of Ever-Renewed Eternal Life.

*Opening Chant:*
Bells and drums manifest auspiciousness to inscribe the scripture,
Unstruck, they resonate with the Mysterious Truth.
I now reveal what was entrusted to none other—
Henceforth, the Peacock Scripture is renewed.

*All respond in unison:*
Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of Ever-Renewed Eternal Life.

The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounds *The Venerable Scripture of the Holy Mother, Jewel Moonlight Empress, Peacock Radiant King*, Scroll the Middle □.

The Dao declares: At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning summoned once more the Celestial Emperor-Lords, Heavenly Kings, Jade Maidens, Dragon Kings, Yakṣas, Dragon Daughters, and all their retinues.
The mighty divine hosts,
the boundless flying heavenly kings,
all mounted five-colored dragon chariots.
Phoenixes sang, simurghs cried,
lions and white cranes,
peacocks of pure radiance.
Paired in ranks, they arrayed to left and right,
listening to the Dharma, expounding the Teaching,
to save and deliver the world’s people,
to extricate all from suffering and hardship.
Responding to every direction, universally liberating without end,
men and women rejoice together, sharing in great peace.
We bow our heads in refuge, with sincere hearts together offering praise.

Now, beneath the altar this day,
we humbly beseech blessings,
dedicating the merit of this scripture’s recitation
for [Name],
that their lifespan reach a hundred years,
in peace and joy, with blessings prolonged.
Disasters dissolved, life extended,
great fortune descended.

At that time, the Original Celestial Venerable again addressed the attendant perfected ones on his left and right, saying: "Now I expound the *Venerable Peacock Sutra*, which responds to all without fail. This sutra is exalted and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. For you and all others, I expound the causes of eliminating transgressions and extinguishing sins in the hells."

Then the Savior-from-Suffering Celestial Venerable arrived and assembled in great compassion, dissolving all karmic offenses in the hells for sentient beings and rescuing those sunk in suffering. If there are beings who broadly cultivate good causes and make various offerings, they may first deliver their nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, ascending to heaven, transforming into human rebirth, and only then can they save others from calamities. Liberated from suffering and ascending, they broadly establish merit, opening vast fields of blessings.

Summoning the eight divisions of devas and dragons, the ten generations of earth deities, the Four Brahma Heavenly Kings, the asura celestial kings, King Yama, the officials of Mount Tai—Minister of Destiny, Recorder, Merit Officer, Executioner—the Five Paths Great Spirits, the lords of hell, the underworld officials and scribes, the bureaucrats, clerks, and ghostly soldiers of the Northern Darkness Fengdu, all reverently prostrate, bow their heads, and address the Celestial Venerable, saying: "The karmic retributions endured by sentient beings in the world are all governed by the great demonic obstructions of sin. In the Jambudvīpa realm, those who commit the ten evils and five rebellions, who are unfilial to parents, who break fasts and violate precepts, who slaughter and cook sheep, cattle, horses, the six livestock, flying birds, and running beasts—after death, they all enter the nine dark hells. Day and night they suffer without release. Without broadly cultivating merit, establishing fasts, and making offerings, even if they accumulate merit through torture and confinement in dark prisons, none will ascend to heaven."

Then the Celestial Venerable, day and night contemplating sentient beings, said: "You should heed my words. When any sinful person dies, or when men, women, parents, or kin pass away in the world, you should establish a Daoist altar, perform rituals, scatter flowers, and broadly offer resources. Conduct repentance fasts, and the underworld will measure their deeds. Those with merit will have their transgressions dissolved by blessings; those without merit will endure karmic retribution. Ten thousand taels of gold cannot be taken with you. Only a few scrolls of true scripture, unbound and unrestrained, can be relied upon. Though gold is precious, it cannot secure your future. Those who recite this sutra will all attain liberation. Though this sutra is subtle, it can save the living and the dead."

Then all prostrated and bowed, entreating the Celestial Venerable to expound and leave behind the names of the Ten Courts of Hell and their officials, broadly making them known. He then proclaimed the sacred titles:

*Begin the "Plucking Tea Leaves Song."*
Invoke the First Court of Hell: Supreme Wondrous Vast Perfected Lord.
*Venerable Peacock Bright King Sutra*, dissolve disasters, extend life, and preserve peace.

Invoke the Second Court of Hell: Yin Virtue Settled Joy Perfected Lord.

Assistant Ministers of the Three Offices of Hell.
Grand Preceptor of the Four Twilight Offices of Hell.
Ox-Head and Horse-Face Hell Guards and Divine Kings.
Innumerable Great Power Demon Kings of Hell.
Officials who measure sin and merit in hell.
All underworld clerks, lords, and masters of the dark yin.

All [respond].

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable, for the sake of all those in the underworld subjected to interrogation and torture, and for the people who, after death, sink into hell—when the Dark Bureau’s virtuous assemblies govern their deliverance, the hells become naturally unobstructed and empty. Their transgressions are extinguished, and they do not pass through hell. Suffering and bitterness are entirely without hindrance.

Then the Heavenly Venerable issued a decree, commanding the Left Bureau’s Yang Officials and the Right Bureau’s Yin Officials to weigh merits and virtues. The interrogating officials of Fengdu’s twenty-four prisons released all suffering ghosts and wandering souls, who then ascended the Fire-Refining Pool. Each assumed a transformed body, holding the cinnabar talismans of the numinous realm to protect their rebirth. Once more, they emerged into the world, attaining human existence. They took refuge in the Daoist and Buddhist teachings, revered the Three Treasures, and served their lords with loyalty and filial piety. They gained carefree freedom, abiding with the Dao in perpetuity.

Thus, the Heavenly Venerable universally delivered all sentient beings and suffering sinners, enabling their transcendence. All you sentient beings, listen carefully. I shall now proclaim for you the incantation for extinguishing sins and ascending as immortals:

*"Fengdu’s night stands firm,
suddenly radiant light shines.
Illuminating the hidden souls,
they ride the fragrant porridge’s steam.
Numinous talismans refine in fire,
a hundred bones take flight.
Witnessing the Dharma assembly,
immortal maidens know the way home."*

Another verse is recited:

*"A chance in ten thousand kalpas,
the immortal affinity is revered.
Opening the hidden path’s secrets,
all relies on the true wind.
Boundless salvation and grace,
thought by thought, karma arises.
Riding the light through the sky,
the deceased are delivered.
Nine generations ascend to heaven,
three lineages escape suffering.
Seven ancestors rise,
disciples and all kin.
The household thrives in peace,
prayers answered by the divine.
Form and origin are reborn,
food and drink reveal their savor.
Disasters dissolve, calamities avert,
lifespan extends.
The whole family shines in glory,
kinfolk live in harmony.
Protected and at peace,
the stars move in accord.
Fortune and emolument grow,
five virtues bring celestial blessings.
The four luminaries rise in splendor,
Great Yin and Great Yang.
Victory and felicity flourish,
the twenty-eight constellations.
Long blessings dispel misfortune,
malevolent stars retreat.
Fortune and longevity shine in glory—
hasten to report to Mysterious Heaven!
Avert calamity and distress,
both the living and dead benefit.
Misfortune departs, fortune arrives.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!"*

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed the Most High Lord Lao: "The sentient beings of the Three Realms drift in the sea of suffering, without liberation. How can you bear this? You must diligently uphold the secret instructions to universally deliver them all."

The Most High diligently upholds the decreed mandate, daring not conceal any truth. If there are sentient beings afflicted by calamity, distress, or illness, they should recite this scripture, invoking the sacred names of the Peacock Radiant King, the Holy Mother Heavenly Venerable, the Heavenly Kings, Dragon Kings, Jade Maidens, Rakṣasas, Dragon Maidens, and Māyā and their hosts. Together, they should entreat the Great Compassionate, Great Merciful, Great Benevolent Perfected Ones, and the Perfected Ones Who Save from Suffering. Thereupon, they shall depart from suffering and attain lasting liberation, forever freed from entanglements, gaining longevity and extended life. Their lifespan shall be prolonged, and all calamities and hardships shall be extinguished.

At that time, the Most High Dao Lord spoke in verse:
The Two Perfected Ones of Great Compassion
Can save the suffering of the Three Realms.
They radiate light to illuminate the world,
Causing hells to cease and desist.
Blade mountains stand towering,
Cauldrons of boiling oil blaze fiercely.
With sincere hearts, invoke the Perfected Ones—
Sinful souls shall be freed from imprisonment and grievance.
Illness and manifold suffering,
Calamities beyond description,
Wounding the viscera and the five spirits,
Move the Perfected Ones to pity and sorrow.
Devout faithful men and women,
Returning to the Dao, must set their hearts sincerely.
Ever mindful of the host of divine beings,
They shall depart from suffering and escape sinking sorrow.
Swiftly dispel grave afflictions,
Evil demons dare not encroach.
Day and night, let the heart not stray—
Liberation shall wholly preserve your body.
With courage and resolve, dedicate the merit,
Together returning to the Forest of Seven Treasures.
Thus do I take refuge,
With wholehearted reverence.

Thereupon, the Perfected One Yin Xi respectfully addressed the throne, saying: "Now, in the lower realms, among sentient beings—men and women—whose three lifetimes of karmic debts and ten great sins may be dissolved and dispersed, some may be renewed, their fortune and longevity increased. Through great compassion and great mercy, they may be spared from entanglements and harm."

Their misfortunes shall befall their descendants,
Extending to nine generations of ancestors.
Long sunk in eternal night,
They universally hope for pardon and liberation.
Men and women, cycling through human form,
Never severing the root—ever dwelling in the human realm.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "This scripture is the sacred utterance of the Three Heavens, the words of all Perfected and Sages. Thus, among the beings of the lower worlds, if there are men or women within great nations who commit many evil deeds—disrespecting Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the king, the land and waters, their parents who gave them life; cursing wind and rain, engaging in all manner of wicked causes—
In ancient times, the people were simple and honest,
Their hearts upright, their natures gentle.
They bore no envy or malice,
Cultivated good thoughts,
And widely practiced kindness.
Thus they attained long life,
All dwelling in peace.

Now, in the latter age, people speak falsely of luck,
Their hearts cunning and deceitful.
They cultivate no good conduct,
Only amassing cruelty.
They do not honor the Great Dao,
But rely on perverse spirits.
They perform spells and curses,
Deliberately harming lives."

At that moment, the Perfected One bowed twice and addressed the throne:
The Dao spoke: "With compassion, I think of the living,
Sunken and lost as lower ghosts,
Their souls tormented and seized,
Their hun and po without refuge.
I wish for a method of liberation,
That all beings may be spared unjust suffering."

The Dao said: "Listen carefully to what I now proclaim.
I have also observed the people of the middle age,
Who specialized in dark sorcery.
They would go to the shrines of perverse demons in heaven and earth,
Where punishment and harm occur.
Recording names and birth signs,
They secretly uttered vows,
Sprinkled water,
Trampled with their feet,
Glaring with bulging eyes and gaping mouths,
Assuming all manner of postures.
Utterly devoid of Dao-mind,
They wantonly harmed the good.
Whether they acted themselves,
Or instructed others to do so;
Whether they suffered themselves,
Or caused others to suffer in return."

"If there are virtuous men or women who have been afflicted by the curses or dark sorcery of evil persons, they should bathe in fragrant waters and establish a Daoist ritual arena. They must invite the Dao and welcome the perfected, prostrating before the Dao’s image. To the Great Compassionate Perfected Ones, the Peacock Radiant Kings, and all the hosts of perfected sages—devote your hearts to reciting this *Sutra of the Venerable Mother Peacock Radiant King*. The merit of this sutra is beyond conception. This sutra can dissolve the Iron Enclosure. This sutra can rescue those afflicted by illness. This sutra can distance one from evil persons. This sutra can dispel all malevolent demons. This sutra can dissolve curses and wicked karma. This sutra can repel all perverse paths. This sutra can avert all disasters of water and fire. This sutra can shatter the great hells. This sutra can protect the land and all weapons of war. This sutra can eradicate locusts and safeguard the virtuous. The virtues of this sutra are inexpressible, beyond full description. Wherever this sutra resides, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, each leading a million soldiers, stand guard. Wherever this sutra is with its disciples, in the four directions, the eight quarters, above and below, and the central realm, all inauspicious omens are severed. Dark sorcery and wooden specters are universally dispelled.

Now the incantation for dark sorcery and gu poison is proclaimed:

The great Dharma stands majestic,
Heaven is round, earth is square.
Heaven has nine pillars,
Earth has nine beams.
Those who cast curses or sorcery
Bring calamity upon themselves.
Six pillars and three beams—
Dark sorcery and gu perish.
Three beams and six pillars—
They return to their originator.
Six Jia and six Yi—
Dark sorcery and gu lose their way.
Six Bing and six Ding—
Dark sorcery and gu take no form.
Six Wu and six Ji—
Dark sorcery and gu do not arise.
Six Geng and six Xin—
Dark sorcery and gu are unreal.
Six Ren and six Gui—
Dark sorcery and gu fall into slumber.
Curses swiftly dissolve,
Grudges and karma flee afar.
Whoever dares defy this decree
Shall be seized and sent to the Thunder Prison,
Their hearts carved out, lungs torn,
Their bodies rent and bloodied.
Those who follow my incantation
Shall attain long life.
Hasten, hasten, as the law commands!"

"Invoking the Three-Five Generals, the Envoys of the Eight Winds, the Community Decrees of the Nine Provinces, with ten thousand generals and warriors, a hundred thousand myriad hosts, to pursue and seize dark sorcery and gu. The Envoys of the Five Tones shall capture and bring forth those who cast dark sorcery and gu. The three hun and seven po shall all be bound in the forbidden prison, never to depart. Those who utter curses upon the wicked—let their essence and spirit scatter, their minds and wills run wild. Their heads shall bear a mountain of fire, fiercely ablaze. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall suffer without respite, day or night.

Should they instead follow the teachings of the Peacock Radiant King Sutra, their bonds shall be loosened and dispersed, and their wronged spirits shall ascend to heaven. The exorcism of grievances and curses, the methods of dark sorcery and demonic forces—I now proclaim. If any good man or woman hears this sutra, great expedient means shall unfold. They shall heal the afflicted, deliver sentient beings, secure peace for their lives, and strengthen their bodies. Their fortune and longevity shall extend, free from all calamities and obstacles. Creditors and adversaries shall swiftly depart and dissolve. Gu poisons shall be released, the Three Corpses expelled, and the Dao attained, becoming perfected.

Then the Most High Lord Lao declared this incantation:
*I once wandered the Middle Kingdom,
Ascended to the Supreme Heaven.
Now I come to the Middle Kingdom,
To teach and transform all beings.
Ninety-six kinds there are,
Each with its own karmic ties.
Those who revere and believe,
Shall transmit it in turn.
With unwavering diligence,
They shall ascend to the Supreme Heaven.
Where this sutra is recited,
That person’s lifespan shall extend.
A hundred spirits come to guard,
Ten thousand illnesses all healed.
In this life, joy shall be theirs,
Their bodies firm as gold and stone.
The supreme and perfect Dao,
Dissolves misfortune, blessings arise.
If they follow my teachings,
Demons below shall turn to dust.
Thus by this scripture’s power,
Enemies shall scatter of themselves.
Those who uphold the true Way
Shall attain long life,
Forever at peace.
Hasten, hasten, as the law commands!*"

The assembly of the faithful, with sincere devotion and focused minds, extol and recite the demon-quelling sacred incantation:

"As wished, as wished—Chumeng, Chumeng.
Heaven’s wheel turns, Heaven’s wheel turns—Falín, Falín.
Juecen, Juecen—Fáduō, Fáduō.
Asuras auspicious, Asuras auspicious.
Turning, turning auspicious—accomplished, accomplished auspicious.
Ascending, ascending auspicious—Bayuan, Bayuan.
Choubo, Choubo—Danliu, Danliu.
Bearing Heaven, bearing Heaven—shouldering stone, shouldering stone.
Jiongkai, Jiongkai—Tuoluo, Tuoluo.
Moho, Moho—Yuansu Daoli Wang.
Jianchou Huoluo Spirit, Liemu Duhuang Wang.
Western Heaven Gualuo Spirit, Longyuan Zhutuo Wang.
Jiangtai Duoluo Spirit, Jiangyin Hebo Wang.
Mountain marsh and abyssal pool spirits, Ninefold Qi Heavenly Demons.
Ten Heavenly Emperors, Supreme Subtlety’s Five Spirits.
Four Watercourses and river sources, Radiant King Heavenly Worthy.
Hasten, hasten, as the law commands!
Pure River leads the way."

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao, since the Primordial Beginning first expounded the scriptures, had instructed the host of immortals and sages to deliver and save all beings, thereby securing peace and tranquility. Calamities were averted, blessings stored; pine trees dispelled malevolent ghosts. Curses were dissolved, inauspicious omens scattered and destroyed. Auspicious signs arrived in abundance, upholding the sagely Dao and ensuring the transmission of scriptural teachings.

Then, the great assembly rejoiced and leapt with joy, their reverence unbounded. They vowed to receive and uphold the teachings, bowing their heads in homage and taking refuge, then withdrew with respectful farewells.

Here is the translation:

---

The Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s *Scripture of the Venerable Peacock Radiant King, Sacred Mother and August Empress of Precious Moonlight* concludes within this fascicle.

**The Three Refuges**
We take refuge in the *Peacock Sutra*,
Safeguarding the nation and securing peace.
May all beings universally
Take refuge in the Most Supreme of Pure Tenuity.

We take refuge in the *Sutra of the Radiant King*,
Illuminating all people in the ten directions.
May all those of karmic affinity
Take refuge in the Most Supreme of Yu-Yu.

We take refuge in the *Sutra of the Sacred Mother*,
First woven in dragon-script majesty.
May all sentient beings
Take refuge in the Most Supreme of Great Red.

May all attain longevity,
Each and every one enjoy peace.
May all afflictions be extinguished,
Dissolved forever, never to arise.

Bowing our heads, we take refuge in the Dao,
Together weaving this good cause.
Born together in the Land of Ultimate Bliss,
As those who attend the Dragon-Flower Assembly.

With sincere hearts, we bow in reverence
To the Upper Clarity Palace of Yu-Yu.
In the Fragrant Grove Garden,
The Numinous Treasure Venerable expounds the Dharma.
Heavenly blossoms descend,
The Most Supreme Venerable universally delivers all beings.
Throughout the world,
In the great chiliocosm, on Jambudvīpa,
Men and women alike—
All take refuge, dispelling evil and aiding the upright.
Rescuing those sunk in suffering,
Saving from life and death,
Attaining wondrous inconceivability.
The Most Supreme Venerable fulfills all vows.
Should one take refuge in the *Peacock Sutra*,
The true teaching master,
The sins of speech shall be dissolved.

Bowing our heads, we take refuge
In the Boundless Great Dao.
For the highest good cause,
With sincere hearts we recite the name of the Great Heavenly Worthy, the Peacock Radiant King.
All respond: Inconceivable merit and virtue.

**Fascicle the Lower of the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s *Scripture of the Venerable Peacock Radiant King, Sacred Mother and August Empress of Precious Moonlight***

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was in the Heaven of Floating Blackness, radiating great light.
He expounded the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dharma,
Unfolding the numinous script of the Peacock.
Again, he summoned the Three Realms and Four Bureaus,
The Five Marchmounts and Four Streams,
The Five Lakes and Four Seas,
The Nine Rivers and Eight Waters,
The Twelve River Sources,
The named mountains and grotto-heavens,
The Earth Prison and Fengdu,
The Water Realms and Yang Ministries,
The Courts of Judgment and Dark Offices,
City Gods and Earth Deities,
The Five Bushel Star Lords,
The Twenty-Eight Constellations,
The Eleven Great Luminaries,
The Four Pillars of Destiny,
The true immortals of the ten directions,
And the innumerable hosts—
All came to bow their heads,
Listening to the teachings of the *Peacock Radiant King Sutra*,
To deliver beings from the sufferings of the world.

Then, the Peacock Radiant King,
Riding the Peacock Host,
Led the Heavenly Kings, Rākṣasas, Jade Maidens, Māyā, Dragon Kings, and their retinues,
Approaching from afar.
He addressed the assembly, saying:
“I am the Teaching Master of the Heaven of Release,
The Tathāgata’s manifested form.
In the Dao, I am called the Sacred Mother and August Empress of Precious Moonlight.
The gates of Dao and Release share a single source of qi.
Through kalpas of cultivation, I have attained the true Dao.
I vow that all beings in the world—
Whether men or women, from life to death, or from death to life—
Must resolve the Three Calamities and Eight Vows,
Deliver from the nine misfortunes of adversity,
And augment blessings and longevity.
Erase the names of the dead,
Inscribe them in the register of the living,
In the ledger of the Ten Fields of Blessing.
Strike out their names from the Azure Scroll of Evil,
And inscribe them in the Golden Tablet of Agelessness.
Should any recite this scripture,
Their names shall be recorded in the immortal registers,
Never to revolve in the wheel of rebirth,
But to enjoy all pleasures.
Should one wish to deliver the nine ancestors and seven generations,
To free them from suffering,
Ascend directly to heaven,
And together attain the fruits of blessedness—
If any dare to disrespect or slight this scripture,
The statutes and laws of the Dark Capital shall punish them,
Bringing disaster and subjecting them to penal judgment.”

Thereupon, the Peacock Radiant King bowed to the Heavenly Worthy,
Listening to the recitation of the *Venerable Peacock Radiant King Sutra*,
Which resolved the matter of the Dragon King of the Deep Pool descending into the scripture.
He vowed to rely on the merit of the scripture
To dispel misfortune without difficulty,
And constantly receive protection and blessings.
He only wished that the Dragon King
Would descend with great auspiciousness.

At that time, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct bowed in reverence and proclaimed this hymn:

Heavenly True Sovereign,
Primordial *qi* of Brahma’s splendor,
Celestial treasure, naturally so—
Each person knows its resonance.
Presiding over the world’s assemblies,
Transforming calamities and hardships,
Those who recite and seek its aid
Shall dispel all inauspiciousness.
The pure *qi* of the Dao
Brings peace without exception.
The Heavenly Officials present the scripture,
A hundred spirits revere its chapters.
Inscribed in divine cinnabar,
Worn or carried, it ensures well-being.
Applied in study,
It brings great fortune and great auspiciousness.

Thereupon, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct bowed and declared that this incantation dissolves misfortune and adversity.

Then the Perfected of the Great Ultimate stepped forward, paid homage, and proclaimed this hymn:

Azure clouds summon the Divine Empyrean,
Vacuous Brahma’s resounding speech.
Layered clouds, the Primordial Honored One,
Nine dragons chariot the Sovereign.
They grasp the azure reins of numinous light,
Gathering blessings in true pearl radiance.
The opening sun reveals the scripture,
The sacred canon emerges in holy verses.
Virtue and fortune arise from this sutra,
Its mysteries shift through hidden grottoes.
Exalted and solemn, the Queen Mother of the August Emperor,
The radiant moon’s successor.
Broadly vowing great compassion,
The *Peacock Great Buddha Mother*.
She saves the world’s suffering—
All who honor her, men and women alike.
The Five Marchmounts bestow blessings,
The Four Waterways confer fortune and longevity.
The Three Officials all endorse,
The Five Dippers pardon transgressions.
The Twelve Palaces’ deities bring fortune,
The Twenty-Eight Constellations ensure peace.
In all undertakings,
Sincerely revere the Primordial August One.
With bowed heads and reverence,
Universal protection descends with blessings.

At that time, the Perfected of Universal Radiance proclaimed again, saying this hymn:

The Jade Emperor’s merit is vast,
The profound principles of the Mystery reach their depths.
Born before the kalpas,
Operating through past and present.
The Holy Mother expounds this wondrous sutra,
Compassionately mindful of all sentient beings.
This sutra is the most wondrous Dharma,
The merit among merits.
Its name is the Most Supreme Sage,
Second to none.
The Great Radiant King,
The *Peacock*’s rare sanctity.
It can shatter all evil demons,
Subduing their hearts.
It can eradicate the gravest sins,
Rendering all pure.
If one hears this sutra
Or hears the name of this Emperor,
Bowing in reverence,
All sins are extinguished.
The ten evils, the four grave offenses,
The five rebellions against father and mother—
With faith, recitation, and discourse,
All vanish at the sound.
It protects humans and heavenly beings,
The four phases and five declines.
The gravest sins of the three evil destinies,
Hardships seen in the human realm:
Famine, plague, and bereavement in inauspicious years,
Poisons, curses, and malevolent hexes,
Imprisonment, enemies, and foes,
The suffering of war and battle,
Perils in mountains and forests,
Tigers, leopards, jackals, and wolves,
Toxic dragons in rivers and seas,
Fierce thunder, wind, rain, and lightning,
Fire, water, and bandits,
The venom of *gu* poisons and their targets,
Madness, delirium, and frenzy,
Snakes, scorpions, and venomous creatures,
Evil demons and malevolent spirits
Seeking opportunities to harm—
All are dissolved by this true sutra.
Chronic and lingering illnesses,
Disturbing dreams and restlessness,
Unjust desires that endanger life,
Premature death—no longer misfortune.
Through encountering this sutra,
One attains peace and freedom.
All aspirations and desires,
Wealth, treasure, and nobility,
Through this sutra’s merit,
Are fulfilled as wished.
Divine immortals of awe-inspiring might,
The hosts of the Eleven Luminaries,
The lords of the Thirty-Three Heavens,
The kings of the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
Divine consorts, jade maidens,
Heavenly deities and earthly spirits,
The gods of the Three Realms and the void,
The Dragon Kings of rivers and seas,
The deities of water, fire, and wind,
The spirits of palaces and dwellings,
The hosts of mountains, forests, trees,
The gods of ditches, wells, and springs—
Through upholding this sutra,
All offer protection.
Clothing and food come naturally,
Descendants dwell in wealth and nobility.
One’s words are heeded,
Wherever one goes, reverence is shown.
For those seeking sons or daughters,
Recite this true and numinous text.
The sutra’s power reaches the celestial bureaus,
Inscribing one as a heavenly immortal.
Descending to be born in their household,
As sons or daughters.
Illustrious and esteemed,
Nine generations ascend as immortals.

Radiance magnifies their gates,
Extending to fathers and mothers.
Auspiciousness ever blazes bright,
Disasters and obstructions cannot encroach.

Therefore, I now proclaim—
Let all the assembly listen attentively.
With compassion, deliver all beings,
That all may attain the Supreme Clarity.

The Holy Mother transmits this precious sutra,
Whereby all affairs align with the heart’s desire.
With single-minded devotion, bow in reverence,
And blessings and prosperity naturally accrue.
The faithful gain longevity,
Their households flourish in splendor.
All sentient beings,
Through this sutra, forever thrive.

All chant together.

At that moment, the great assembly bowed their heads in reverence,
Moved by the sacred words that save all beings.
Then the Heavenly Worthy once more proclaimed the precious, solemn Brahma-sound incantation:

All are utterly extinguished.
Auspicious clouds gather,
Fortune and longevity flourish in peace.
Ancestors transform anew,
All attain liberation.
Every sentient being
Together ascends the Dao’s fruit.

With devoted hearts, bow in reverence,
Ever descending with auspiciousness.

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law.

*Qingjiang Prelude.*
*Newly composed.*
All [chant].

The Dao speaks: As the sutra nears its conclusion,
Dragons, cranes, and celestial immortals come to receive it.
Ahead, nine phoenixes cry in unison;
Behind, eight simurghs sing in harmony.
Lions and white cranes
Arrayed to left and right.
Celestial processions escort them,
Returning to the Golden Palace.
Peacock Radiant King and all his retinue
Each return to their blessed realms.
Kings of the Underworld’s dark realms
Each proceed to their yin domains.
Dragon Kings and dragon maidens
Each return to their oceanic treasuries.
Rākṣasas and Māyā demons
Dwell where they reside.
Thunder Sovereign of the Yang Courts
Returns to his palace.
Lineage masters and perfected beings
Each return to their domains.
Guardians of the sutra and precepts,
Households who honor incense and flame—
Earth deities and city gods
Each reside in their halls.
The Eight Divisions of Devas and Dragons,
The Four Great Vajras,
Follow wherever the sutra abides.

Thereupon, the great assembly rejoices,
Bowing their heads in reverence,
Faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.
They pay homage to the celestial countenance,
Take their leave, and depart.

Thus concludes the *Sutra of the Venerable Peacock Radiant King, Holy Mother the Moonlight Empress*, spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

Music is played.
Disciples devoutly present offerings,
Making offerings to the sacred hosts of the ten directions.

On the Ten Offerings.

**The Three Refuges and Dedication of Merit**
We take refuge in the most wondrous scriptures,
Protecting the nation and anchoring the celestial stars.
May all beings universally,
Take refuge,
And together rejoice in peace and prosperity.

We take refuge in the wondrous Dharma scriptures,
The Dharma manifests, revealing the celestial deities.
May all spirits in the world universally,
Take refuge,
And together form good karmic causes.

We take refuge in the scriptures of Dao and virtue,
The profound mysteries within the Dao are deep.
May all who recite and intone universally,
Take refuge,
And together ascend to the Jade Capital.

May all attain longevity,
Each one rejoicing in peace and prosperity.
May all afflictions be extinguished,
Dispelled forever, never to arise.
We bow our heads, take refuge in the Dao,
Together forming good karmic causes.
May we be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss,
As people of the three assemblies beneath the Dragon Flower.

With sincere faith, we pay homage,
To the honored treasure of the Great Clarity’s master.
Through eternal years, in the Palace of the Great Ultimate,
May we observe the world,
All sentient beings.
The Most High Honored One,
All who fall into hell,
Enter deviant sects,
Are reborn as beasts,
Lose their human form—
Relying on the master’s compassion,
To uplift and guide,
The great sage, profoundly efficacious.
Transforming the myriad people,
Cultivating merit and fruit,
Repenting and eradicating the sins of many beings.
The Most High Honored One,
Ten thousand blessings naturally arrive.
If one takes refuge in the Peacock Sutra,
The true teaching’s master,
The sins of the mind and deeds are dissolved.

We bow our heads, take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao.
For the highest good cause,
With sincere devotion, we recite and intone,
Dispelling calamities and obstacles, Heavenly Worthy.
Inconceivable merit and virtue.

Music is played.
Transforming wealth.
Returning the demonstration.
Raising the thought.

We humbly acknowledge that the Dao is transmitted by the sacred,
And cultivation rests with oneself.
All that is done
Arises from the heart.
With earnest and devout prayers,
All pay reverent homage.
From the altar just now,
Having recited and intoned the *Sutra of the Venerable Peacock Radiant King, Holy Mother the Moonlight Empress* several times,
We respectfully dedicate the merit.

To the Three Clarities and August Saints,
The Jade Emperor and Jade Honored One,
The Sacred Father and Sacred Mother,
The Three Treasures and Three Realms,
The sovereign of the Peacock Radiant King,
The lofty perfected of the Dharma realm,
The ancestral masters who transmitted the teachings of past and present,
The celestial beings who expound the scriptures and propagate the Dharma,
The stars of the Southern Asterism and Northern Culmen,
The Dipper constellations of East, West, and Center,
The twenty-eight lunar mansions and twelve palaces,
The myriad perfected of the universal Milky Way,
The Year-Star of the current year and the original spirit of one’s birth,

The dragon deities of the Four Seas and Nine Rivers,
The demonic Yakṣas and dragon maidens,
The dragon lords and jade maidens of the Heavenly Kings,
The local earth deities of ancestral shrines and incense fires,
The dragon deities of life mandates and earthly prohibitions,
The city gods and village altars of local sacrifices,
The temple deities of the sacred Mount Tai in the region,
The fire departments of the plague controllers,

The heroic spirits responsive to sacrifices,
The malevolent deities of creditors and debtors,
The ghostly multitudes of those with unresolved grievances,
The malevolent spirits causing chaos within the body,
The perfected immortals present in the assembly this day—

The witnessing and covenanting deities responsive to the Daoist ritual,
The celestial hosts of inspectors and guardians of the Dao,
The thunder soldiers who subdue demons and vanquish monsters,
The celestial sages attending the scriptural assembly,
All divine immortals and protectors of the teachings—
By the merit of this scripture, we humbly offer our devotion.
We beseech your grace, specifically for [Name], to eradicate transgressions and augment longevity.

May the power of this scripture extend its blessings, and the imperial heart dispense boundless grace.

May the realm and its households perpetually enjoy peace,
And all disputes and self-interest yield to harmony.
May all sentient beings equally partake in the sacred grace.

With devoted hearts, we invoke the Great Heavenly Worthy of the Peacock Radiance.
All respond: Inconceivable merit and virtue.

This scripture, in its origin, was discovered within the Wudang Great Peak.
Li, the superintendent of the Purple Cloud Palace of Supreme Harmony, found a lost scripture of eighty-five scrolls within a cave behind the Cliff of Self-Abandonment. Appended to it was this Daoist Peacock Scripture in three scrolls.
Retrieved from the cave’s depths and returned to the palace, it was revealed to be a convergence of Daoist and Buddhist teachings.
Though some may doubt, I have preserved it within the palace. Unbeknownst, the scripture’s inherent power could not be concealed, and thus it is fitting to transmit it to the world.
Now, copying the ancient text, we distribute it to all directions.
Should Daoist priests recognize its sounds, chant, and recite it, their blessings shall be immeasurable.
Above, it repays the sovereign; below, it aids the three realms.
The nation prospers, the people are at peace, winds are harmonious, and rains are timely.
All people delight in their livelihoods, and everywhere reigns tranquility.

In the auspicious first full moon of the dingwei year, the thirty-fifth of the Wanli reign of the Great Ming (1607), the Orthodox Unity Lineage’s Successor-in-Doctrine, the Profoundly Sincere, Dao-Revealing, Teaching-Expounding, Great Perfected One—Zhang Guoxiang, who oversees all Daoist affairs under Heaven—was commanded by imperial decree to collate and print this scripture.

Here ends *The Venerable Scripture of the Holy Mother Peacock Radiant King*.
