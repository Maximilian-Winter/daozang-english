**The Marvelous Scripture of the Supreme Saintly Radiant Spirit Marshal for Protecting the State**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Prosperous Peace, the Righteous and Brave Martial King of Security, the Marquis of Hanshou Pavilion and Great Marshal Guan—enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Revered Tranquility—along with his sagely father, the Illustrious and Upright Loyalty-Assisting Benevolent and Wise King; his sagely mother, the Assisting Compliance and Luminous Primordial Lady; his divine sons and holy grandsons; the strategizing marshals; the generals commanding left and right, leading and dividing troops; the spirits of lying in ambush and descending with forces; the spirits of concealing and withdrawing troops; the spirits of arraying and maneuvering formations; the spirits of massing and advancing in battle; the spirits of water and fire formations; the celestial soldiers of the Eight Directions and Eight Destructive Forces, the Four Quarters and Four Valiant Ones; the generals who wield lightning, roar with thunder, ascend clouds to summon rain, sound gongs and drums, and issue commands; together with all civil and martial officials, the perfected immortals of Jade Spring Mountain—

We have received the Jade Emperor’s decree and commission as the Universal Overseer of the Three Realms, the Inspector of the Thunder-Fire-Pestilence Bureau, and the Censor of Fengdu in the Netherworld, charged with governing the ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms.

Now, ascending the altar, We make known to you all:
When the sun stands at the center of heaven, it universally illuminates the ten thousand directions.
When the heart abides in the center of the person, it admits no selfishness.

Better to be a loyal minister though unused than to flatter and deceive one’s lord with perversity.
Better to be a filial child though unrecognized than to harbor resentment and defy one’s parents.

Whether in the great principles of human relations or the minutiae of daily life, all must examine themselves and minimize transgressions. One must never benefit oneself at others’ expense.

A thought aligned with rectitude brings auspicious stars and felicitous clouds.
A thought aligned with depravity summons baleful vapors and ominous miasmas.
Good and evil are as clear as fire observed; fortune and misfortune respond like a balance held.

All living beings under heaven must swear allegiance to this heart.

We oversee the Thunder Bureau’s thunderbolts, swiftly memorializing the Heavenly Court.
By day, We examine the merits and faults of the yang forces; by night, We judge the ghosts and spirits of the Netherworld.

Should one transcribe a thousand copies of this scripture, it surpasses the merit of reading an entire canon of true scriptures.
We shall dispatch celestial soldiers to guard you, and a hundred blessings will naturally converge.

The incantation is now spoken:

The Great Sage, Slayer of Demons, Inspector of the Three Realms’ Ghosts and Spirits, Chief Administrator of Penal Laws, Envoy of the Three Realms for the Investigation and Capture of Ghosts, Great General of the Primordial Qi’s Seven Ranks Who Subdues Dragons and Tames Tigers, Perfected Lord of Lofty Peace, Grand Marshal of Thunder Rites Who Subdues Evil and Leads Punitive Expeditions, Commander-in-Chief of the Thirty-Six Thunders, Imperial Censor of the Fengdu Court, Grand Overseer of the Penal Affairs of the Three Realms’ Ghosts and Spirits, Supervisor of Penal Cases and Mighty Celestial Soldier of Divine Radiance, Grand Marshal of the Three Realms’ Armies and Recruiter of Troops, Supreme Marshal Who Executes Gods and Slays Ghosts Across Heaven and Earth.

At that time, the assembled civil and martial sages, having heard this scripture expounded, none failed to leap with joy, praising and extolling its goodness.

Should one recite it with sincere devotion—whether emperor above or commoner below—one shall attain the harmonious passage of stars, the peace of the altars of soil and grain, the well-being of all people, and the eradication of disasters and calamities. All prayers and supplications shall meet with response. All beings, human and celestial, shall partake of its benefits. Those who believe, accept, and practice it shall bow in reverence and depart.

*The Marvelous Scripture of the Illustrious Divine General, Great Sage, and Guardian of the State*

On an auspicious day of the Upper Prime of the year *dingwei*, the thirty-fifth year of the Wanli reign of the Great Ming (1607),

respectfully commissioned the carving of the woodblocks upon imperial decree.
