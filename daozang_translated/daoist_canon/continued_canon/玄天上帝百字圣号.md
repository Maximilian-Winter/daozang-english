**Divination Lots of the Dark Warrior Supreme Emperor’s Response**

**First Lot: Great Auspice – The Flying Dragon Transforms**
*Sacred Intent:*
The flying dragon transforms, joyfully meeting its time;
On this day, ascension fulfills the appointed hour.
Plans and hopes for wealth bring abundant fortune;
Seeking office and promotion—no doubt remains.

*Plans and Hopes:*
Ambition soars, filling the heart;
A noble one should not long remain in poverty.
This journey shall meet with wind and clouds;
Above ten thousand, you shall display your heroism.

*Household:*
The Three Yangs converge, turning the great wheel;
Auspicious qi welcomes the gate—all things renewed.
The year is bountiful, harvests prosper, wealth and rank flourish;
Another child is added—joy and kinship abound.

*Marriage:*
The great rite of the world is marriage;
How can mortals comprehend Heaven’s decree?
If one knows the harmony of Heaven’s principle,
Why need one earnestly inquire of the gods?

*Lost Property:*
Do not blame Heaven for the loss of wealth;
Know that its traces lie to the south.
In time, word shall surely come;
Do not falsely accuse the innocent of theft.

*Legal Matters:*
No need for anger before documents are issued;
Though the court is just, the case will not proceed.
Better to dispel the fire in your heart,
Lest you waste money on others.

*Traveler:*
The lot speaks of the flying dragon—do not ask after kin;
Across a thousand mountains and ten thousand rivers, how many hardships?
Only when the bright moon gathers all in reunion,
West of Yang Pass, shall you see your old friend.

*Illness:*
Burn incense, pray with focused intent;
Only in your heart can you cultivate the field of merit.
Lifespan is predestined in the celestial registers;
Why labor in secret for recovery and peace?

*Explanation:*
Households shall be at peace, the sick shall recover at once, pregnancies shall bear sons, travelers shall arrive immediately, legal matters shall be resolved, lost property may be found, marriages shall be concluded, journeys shall be auspicious, official posts shall be attained, wealth shall be greatly obtained, fields and silkworms shall thrive, livestock shall flourish—all affairs shall be greatly auspicious.

**Second Lot: Middling-Lower – The Tiger Emerges from the Great Forest**
*Sacred Intent:*
The tiger emerges from the great forest, stirring the crowd;
Though people see it, they are filled with doubt and worry.
Though it may not take lives,
It will surely cause alarm—this much is known.

*Plans and Hopes:*
Upholding injustice defies Heaven’s principle;
Reckless action has ever been the root of misfortune.
The noble one, content in poverty, shall find the Way;
Do not let miscalculation lead to others’ deceit.

*Household:*
Long confined to a humble abode, desiring renewal,
Yet how can this household lack fortune?
Do not fear vain alarms, strange dreams, or nightmares;
Beware of harm to children and women.

*Marriage:*
At first glance, the appearance is fine,
But who could foresee half would prove false?
If this is not a true match, do not oppose it;
Better to withdraw and return home.

*Lost Property:*
Only for lack of care at first,
Wealth is lost—how can it be found again?
Wait until the end of the month, on the days of *yin* and *shen*,
When someone may bring word.

*Legal Matters:*
Better to remain at home, awaiting your fate;
Do not enter the courts to suffer the lash.
I urge you: do not meddle in others’ affairs,
Lest sorrow come, and regret follow too late.

*Traveler:*
No letters, no news—like fish and geese lost in the vastness;
In vain, you strain your gaze into the bewildering clouds.
If you meet on the days of *yin* or *chen*,
Magpies shall chatter at the eaves—man and horse shall return.

*Illness:*
Illness in clamor, recovery in stillness;
Do not regard it as commonplace.
If you have vows in your heart, fulfill them early,
Lest accumulated heat turn to spleen-cold.

*Explanation:*
Do not venture out; lost property is hard to find. The sick should perform merit-making rites. Travelers have word but have not yet arrived. Wealth comes slowly. Children and women may face misfortune. Pregnancies may be difficult. Legal matters may be settled through mediation. Official posts remain unattained. Marriages are hard to conclude. Livestock, fields, and silkworms shall yield half their harvest.

---

**Third Lot: Great Auspice – From Utmost Adversity Comes Great Peace**
*Sacred Intent:*
From utmost adversity, great peace now comes;
The Dragon Spring sword is polished, old dust swept away.
Do not believe that self-restraint leaves no other hope—
Even in seclusion, behind closed doors, wealth shall be gained.

*Plans and Hopes:*
For years, you wandered rivers and lakes;
Only now, with fame and profit achieved, do you emerge from hardship.
Today, meeting the power of officials and nobility,
You shall see spring’s colors fill the imperial capital.

*Household:*
Do not worry that your household has long been impoverished;
How could Heaven’s principle be biased toward any person?
If only you are willing to reform past faults,
I assure you: wealth and grain shall surpass the usual year.

*Marriage:*
Fate is arranged by the Creator—do not lament its absence;
Why sigh that matters do not harmonize?
At this moment, listen well to the zither’s melody;
Do not let night rain drip on empty steps.

*Lost Property:*
For years, you sifted gold from sand,
Only to lose it—knowing then the vain toil.
Now, seeking it is hard to find;
Only after *gen* shall you meet a confidant.

*Legal Matters:*
By chance, you suffer injustice pressing upon your body;
How can the wronged voice their grievance?
Yet the gods and spirits shall secretly protect you,
And not let the good become prisoners.

*Traveler:*
Crossing rivers and mountains, ten thousand layers deep,
Gazing back toward home—white clouds shroud the way.
Yet all along, hidden merit has shielded you;
You dwell in the warmth of spring’s harmonious breeze.

*Illness:*
Stubbornness and cruelty invite calamity;
Heaven’s reproach strips the flesh, leaving bones like firewood.

*Explanation:*
Households shall be at peace, the sick shall recover immediately, pregnancies shall bear sons, travelers shall arrive at once, legal matters shall be resolved, lost property may be found, marriages shall be concluded, journeys shall be auspicious, official posts shall be attained, wealth shall be greatly obtained, fields and silkworms shall thrive, livestock shall flourish—all affairs shall be greatly auspicious.

If one aligns with the Dao-heart and reforms past errors,
Withered branches and leaves shall bloom all at once.

*Explanation:*
Households shall thrive with great prosperity for its members. For illness, perform virtuous deeds; legal matters shall be justified; wealth shall be obtained as desired; pregnancies shall bear sons; official posts shall be attained; travelers shall arrive soon; livestock shall flourish; fields and silkworms shall yield abundant harvests; the body shall be greatly auspicious; marriages shall be concluded.

**Fourth Slip: Middle-Lower**   *Laboring Heart, Expending Strength*

*Sacred Intent:*
Laboring heart, expending strength to succeed,
Yet when flowers bloom, a gust of wind arrives.
One must rely on a noble’s light assistance—
Then another branch shall bloom red in the distance.

*Plans and Aspirations:*
Exhausting schemes, yet affairs remain unfulfilled;
Now cease inquiring about future prospects.
Wait until the golden crow reaches *Kun* and *Zhen*—
Then glory and profit shall naturally arise.

*Household:*
No cause for idle matters to drain one’s strength,
Vainly pursuing greed without discernment.
Livestock losses are but minor setbacks—
Beware further shocks to the household.

*Marriage:*
When the wedding day arrives, no need to seek it;
Why trouble oneself with futile efforts?
Intent on planting flowers, yet they fail to grow—
Casually planted willows, however, form a grove.

*Lost Property:*
Enduring hardship to amass wealth,
Who would have thought today’s ashes bring disaster?
Gain and loss, wealth and poverty—all by fate’s decree;
Now cease needless suspicion and doubt.

*Legal Matters:*
Since ancient times, stubbornness invites ruin;
Who knew that having reason would bring reproach?
Now, official punishment may not befall you—
Why not privately reconcile and be kind?

*Traveler:*
Departing with hopes of gathering gold,
Gazing back—home lies deep beyond the path.
Had one known earlier how affairs would change,
Why not have abandoned greed from the start?

*Illness:*
Believing action alone was truly wondrous,
Never expecting greed to sow disaster’s roots.
In vain, the seven emotions harm the body—
Early seek virtuous aid to ensure no doubt.

*Explanation:*
Households shall face calamities among members; losses of the heart shall occur; wealth shall not be obtained; lost property shall not be found—seek it urgently; travelers shall not arrive; illness shall be severe; performing virtuous deeds or seeking office shall not succeed; pregnancies shall bring alarm; fields and silkworms shall yield half their harvest; livestock must be safeguarded; marriages shall not be concluded; legal matters shall be reconciled.

---

**Fifth Slip: Great Auspice**   *Sailing with Favorable Winds*

*Sacred Intent:*
Sailing with favorable winds, no doubt remains;
Crossing rivers at the opportune moment.
A journey of ten thousand *li* shall surely be completed—
All plans shall succeed as scheduled.

*Plans and Aspirations:*
In seeking action or stillness, harbor no doubt;
Pursue fame and profit without delay.
Seize the moment when opportunity arises—
Lest you miss the tide of fortune’s harmony.

*Household:*
The household flourishes with abundant blessings;
No calamities among its members, all affairs harmonious.
Spring and summer may bring minor regrets,
But autumn and winter shall overflow with joy.

*Marriage:*
A century’s union formed in a single day—
Why trouble over trifles now?
Both sides consent without further ado—
Proceed joyfully to wed the fair bride.

*Lost Property:*
Yesterday’s skiff passed Dongting Lake,
Knowing your heart remains unsettled.
Though a mundane item was lost,
There is reason—do not be alarmed.

*Legal Matters:*
With reason on your side, why consult the divine?
Even if taken to court, no harm shall befall you.
Though presently filled with fear,
You shall be safeguarded, all affairs resolved.

*Traveler:*
The return date is set, yet sorrow lingers,
For lingering matters remain unresolved.
If the gods of fortune lend their aid,
A swift sail shall bring the boat to shore.

*Illness:*
Who senses disaster arriving like the wind?
Even *Lu Yi* and *Bian Que* labor in vain.
Yet if one’s vow moves Heaven and Earth,
More years shall be granted to live as an elder.

*Explanation:*
Households shall be greatly auspicious; wealth shall bring joy; lost property may be found; illness shall gradually recede; travelers shall arrive soon; legal matters shall be justified; marriages shall be concluded; fields and silkworms shall flourish; livestock shall thrive; the body shall be auspicious for virtuous deeds; official posts shall be attained; pregnancies shall bear sons—all affairs shall be greatly auspicious.

**Sixth Slip: Lower-Lower**   *Mandarin Ducks Part Ways*

*Sacred Intent:*
Mandarin ducks, obstructed, part in flight;
Plans and wealth remain unfulfilled.
It is best to maintain the old—cease change—
Now, hesitation lingers in advance or retreat.

*Plans and Aspirations:*
Fame and profit have never been easily sought—
Worldly affairs, like gulls on water, drift aimlessly.
Heaven does not desire man’s greed—
In vain, floating clouds turn hair white.

*Household:*
Hoping this year would bring prosperity,
Who knew a minor matter would invite disaster?
If now both people and wealth fare well,
Revere the household gods with incense at the hearth.

*Marriage:*
Not aligning with fate’s design,
Forcing a union brings no benefit.
Even if bound by destiny for a time,
Parting shall come, each to their own way.

*Lost Property:*
Losing mundane wealth, one asks the divine—
Do not suspect others now.
Heaven’s ledgers have long determined each measure;
Clothing and food shall come as sought, without harm.

*Legal Matters:*
Do not heed those who urge you to court;
Both sides shall only deepen enmity.
Better to let go and seek peace—
Avoid crying "father" at the magistrate’s gate.

*Traveler:*
Departing with many brothers,
Who would have thought the group would scatter midway?
Though delayed, they shall arrive in time—
No need to wait daily by the wicker gate.

*Illness:*
Wife divines for husband, husband for wife—
All day, one must endure solitary sorrow.
Uncles, brothers, or elders divining for a man—
Though illness runs deep, recovery is still possible.

*Explanation:*
Households shall face disputes and calamities; lost property shall not be found; legal matters should be reconciled; wealth shall not be obtained; official posts shall not be attained; illness requires offerings to household gods; travelers may be sought but shall not arrive soon; pregnancies shall bear daughters; fields and silkworms shall yield half their harvest; livestock shall be safeguarded; the body shall face delays; marriages shall not be concluded.

**Seventh Slip: Middle-Upper**   *Withered Tree Meets Spring*

*Sacred Intent:*
A withered tree meets spring, its hues renewed,
Suddenly its branches flourish, sprouting buds.
Let no one cut it for firewood—
Wait until spring deepens, and it shall bloom again.

**Seeking Aspirations:**
Long have you waited in the mountains for good tidings,
None to pluck or speak of your hidden worth.
Now, borrowing a gust of wind’s might,
Leaves flourish, flowers bloom thick, casting shade upon the earth.

**Household:**
Stagnation dissolves—now boast is right,
A lucky star shines upon your home.
From this day, heed no idle talk,
For when the tree stands straight, why fear the slanting sun?

**Marriage:**
For years, nine proposals met no call,
Yet today, withered branches sprout fresh shoots.
Though marriage joins a thousand leagues,
Without affinity, faces remain distant, paths far.

**Lost Property:**
Clearly lost to the east,
Yet you rush about, seeking in vain.
Wait but three to five days more,
And another shall claim the prize with idle words.

**Legal Matters:**
New troubles wound, old ones resolve—
I urge you, do not flaunt your prowess.
With a calm heart, the court shall favor you,
For this place was never meant to ascend.

**Traveler:**
A letter was promised to your home,
Yet human affairs remain unaligned.
Wait until the Three Yangs turn the horse,
And suddenly, brocade robes shall grace your doorstep.

**Illness:**
Without misfortune, no thought of Amitābha,
Yet in sickness, old vows multiply.
If you wholeheartedly repent and reform,
You shall not meet Yama with the virtuous.

*Explanation:*
For households, minor members face calamity; the ill should make offerings; beware of petty people’s encroachment; lost property must be sought swiftly; wealth remains unattained; travelers send word but do not arrive; official posts are not secured; fields and silkworms yield half their harvest; a son shall be born; livestock remain auspicious; marriage may yet conclude.

---

**Eighth Slip: Lower-Lower**   *Fishing Boat Ascends the Rapids*

*Sacred Intent:*
Seeing the fishing boat struggle against the rapids,
It moors here, lingering in hesitation.
Though the first rapid is passed without incident,
Ahead lies another—crossing it shall be harder still.

**Seeking Aspirations:**
Fate offers no timely boon—cease your pursuit,
Why cast your fishing boat day and night?
The red-scaled fish lie deep in autumn’s waves,
Exhaust your schemes, yet none shall bite the hook.

**Household:**
Unwilling to be content, ever covetous,
You provoke the household gods to bring misfortune.
Spring and summer bring sorrow—illness among kin,
Autumn and winter fear the ruin of fields and grain.

**Marriage:**
Others say the match is perfect,
Yet who can fathom hearts harboring wolves and tigers?
Fair faces hide foul hearts,
Who knows the loneliness of a solitary rattan bed?

**Lost Property:**
All because of a small loss—donkey or ox,
It gnaws at your heart, filling your days with worry.
Human eyes are not as keen as Heaven’s gaze,
Clearly teaching you: do not covet.

**Legal Matters:**
Where reconciliation is possible, reconcile,
For everywhere, human hearts harbor malice and deceit.
Do not trust drunken, reckless words,
Who knows the difficulty of pleading before the tribunal?

**Traveler:**
Your heart is torn between two anxieties,
The road is blocked, your thoughts unfree.
How many grievances and resentments weigh you down,
Yet no word reaches Yangzhou.

**Illness:**
A trifling matter vexes your heart,
Summoning strange ailments of doubt and sorrow.
Hasten to seek blessings in stillness,
Lest further retribution cast you into the dust.

*Explanation:*
For households, calamity befalls the people; guard your words; the ill should make offerings; lost property shall not be found; wealth remains unattained; travelers do not arrive; legal matters lose their just cause; official posts are not secured; fields and silkworms yield half their harvest; childbirth brings false alarms; livestock fare well; marriage proves difficult to conclude.

---

**Ninth Slip: Middle-Fair**   *Spring Orchid, Autumn Chrysanthemum*

*Sacred Intent:*
The orchid’s fragrance in spring is truly lovely,
The chrysanthemum’s green bloom and hues are fine.
Heaven and Earth each follow their own inclinations,
Uncomprehending the east wind’s sequential blossoming.

**Seeking Aspirations:**
Once you were promised spring’s arrival,
Yet your schemes faltered, intentions misaligned.
Wait until the month when chrysanthemums and plums unfold,
And once more, fame and profit shall be yours in full.

**Household:**
You hoped for harmony, all things to prosper,
Yet years of sorrow remain unrelieved.
For failing to honor the household gods,
Your gates stand empty, voices unheard.

**Marriage:**
When marriage is meant to be, wait for the full moon,
No need for your heart to hang in suspense.
Though this is a fine match,
Alas, the other’s resolve is not yet firm.

**Lost Property:**
Why blame Heaven for your loss?
Would the gods pity you for mere wealth?
If you seek true tidings,
Not this year, but the next—or the one after.

**Legal Matters:**
I warn you: do not indulge in greed or wrath,
Lest documents summon you to court.
In all matters, retreat is best—
Close your door, sit in stillness, and become a worthy one.

**Traveler:**
Though long gone, word is scarce,
Why hesitate now?
Orchids and chrysanthemums shall bloom in their time,
Each awaits its season, its roots and shoots.

**Illness:**
Here you languish, resentment filling your breast,
Without the right medicine, matters remain unresolved.
Wait until the third watch of the night for peace,
When misfortune departs and blessings descend.

For households, guard against calamity for minor members and women; make offerings; lost property is hard to recover; the ill should make offerings; wealth is half-attained; travelers send word; legal matters linger unresolved; childbirth is delayed; livestock thrive; marriage may be concluded, though late.

---

**Tenth Slip: Lower-Lower**   *Bees Gather Honey*

*Sacred Intent:*
Whether on flat land or mountain peaks,
All the world’s beauty is claimed.
After gathering a hundred flowers to make honey,
For whom is the toil? For whom the sweetness?

**Seeking Aspirations:**
Entrust your affairs to another,
Then turn back early to your homeland.
Fair words hide foul hearts—
Foolishly, you rush toward disaster.

**Household:**
This year, fields and silkworms bring half-fortune,
Summer and autumn fear the loss of oxen and sheep.
In deep winter, safeguard your household,
Beware of villains slipping through the walls at night.

**Marriage:**
Do not be enchanted by wildflowers,
For joy at its peak soon turns to sorrow.
Restrain your heart and await marriage,
Lest others stir up gossip and strife.

**Lost Property:**
Do not blame Heaven for lost wealth,
Who told you to trust the greedy and slumber?
Know now it has fallen into another’s hands—
Not among the reeds or shallow waters.

*Explanation:*
For households, guard against calamity for minor members; the ill should make offerings; lost property is irrecoverable; wealth remains unattained; travelers do not arrive; legal matters are unfavorable; official posts are not secured; fields and silkworms yield half their harvest; childbirth is difficult; livestock fare well; marriage proves difficult to conclude.

**Legal Matters:**
In this world, greed and wrath are hardest to forswear—
Like the mantis, blind to danger in its mirth.
Beware the cicada you seize in jest,
For the oriole lurks unseen behind.

**Travelers:**
Through myriad peaks you press on, weary and worn,
Your heart still restless, your return delayed.
Yet darker perils lie along the way—
How many unseen dangers lurk between?

**Illness:**
When grave sickness strikes, what can you do?
Day by day it worsens, Death draws near.
To drive the baleful star away,
Summon a high monk without delay.

**Eleventh Slip: Most Auspicious – Prisoner Released from Custody**

**Sacred Meaning:**
The prisoner leaves his cell, his lawsuit done,
Then buys sweet melons to take to the tavern.
There he meets an old friend, and they drink their fill—
The wine paid for, they toast each other again.

**Plans and Aspirations:**
Long buried, your path was blocked, unfulfilled,
But now Heaven’s grace descends upon you.
Amend your past faults and walk the great Dao—
Wealth and rank will naturally follow.

**Household:**
Horses thrive, people prosper—all is well,
Fields and silkworms yield tenfold by autumn.
Yet guard against hidden ills in the young—
Joy abounds, no cause for worry or deceit.

A bond forged in past lives meets in this one,
Let not wealth stir love or hatred between you.
If a noble patron lifts you up,
You’ll climb the laurel to the clouds.

Do not wrongly accuse the innocent,
Your lost goods lie clearly west of the market bridge.
Now, with divine aid to rely upon,
Though not all may return, some will be restored.

You’ve always feared the law and officialdom,
And now your troubles bring you near to ruin.
Yet a wise judge watches with clear eyes—
No need for sorrow or anxious thoughts.

Today, in a distant land, you meet an old friend.
His heart races homeward like river waves—
Only the timing remains in question.

Years passed before you escaped strife’s door,
Who would have thought heaven’s disaster would strike?
If you do not seek the gods’ protection,
You’ll linger long, trapped in the dust.

**Twelfth Slip: Most Inauspicious – Wind Scatters Willow Catkins**

**Sacred Meaning:**
Willow catkins swirl in the wind, gone without trace,
Like King Xiang’s dream in the still of night.
Moonlit and quiet, the breeze whispers low—
They drift and fall, entangling the fragrant grove.

**Plans and Aspirations:**
Against the season’s flow, you grasp for wealth,
Your heart set high—you bring ruin upon yourself.
If you persist in reckless, improper deeds,
Disaster will strike, and heaven’s wrath descend.

**Household:**
Returning at dusk through treacherous paths,
Beware of strife that stirs within your home.
The young ones bring misfortune to the house,
Fields, livestock, and silkworms all suffer loss.

**Marriage:**
Without a destined bond, do not insist,
The two are ill-matched in fate and years.
The matchmaker is but a deceiver—
Even if it seems to work, it won’t last long.

**Lost Property:**
This was never truly your own wealth,
Why fret and guess so endlessly?
Not only will you lose your capital,
But even if found, misfortune will follow.

**Legal Matters:**
Trouble strikes suddenly, though you feared none,
Your heart heavy with sorrow—when will it lift?
Now, embrace peace as the greatest virtue,
Lest your silver flow to the courts in vain.

**Travelers:**
No word from the fish, no trace of the crow,
Stranded on a desolate road, blocked at every turn.
A thousand miles from home, you cannot return—
Gazing back at Yang Pass, the clouds hang thick.

**Illness:**
A dream drifts into the netherworld’s distant road,
Offerings to the gods bring only sighs.
The falling flower longs to follow the stream,
But the stream, indifferent, leaves it behind.

*Explanation:*
For households, misfortune looms; women and children face unseen dangers; illness is grave—offerings are needed; wealth is unattainable; travelers do not arrive; legal matters may be settled through mediation; official posts are unattained; fields and silkworms yield half their harvest; childbirth is difficult; marriage fails; livestock require protection—all affairs are inauspicious.

**Thirteenth Slip: Most Auspicious – Flowers Bloom and Bear Fruit**

**Sacred Meaning:**
Flowers bloom and bear fruit in timely joy,
Thanks to spring’s workings and nature’s craft.
All hopes and plans come to fruition,
Returning home in splendor is within reach.

**Plans and Aspirations:**
Like jade’s unyielding purity, you stand firm,
Only the winter’s cold knows your true heart.
Now, with the return of warmth and light,
Though flowers fall, the branches bear their fruit.

Wealth multiplies, and noble guests arrive.
Your household is complete, thieves kept at bay—
Peace surpasses all beneath the nine skies.

A beauty and a talented scholar—rare in this world,
Their bond was destined long ago, no doubt remains.
If the other consents, do not delay—

Do not press the innocent for details.
You sit facing west, yet know this—
The lost item lies clearly to the east.

Young troublemakers stir unrest, but fear not,
No need to fret over the outcome now.
The court holds a true and shining mirror—
Right and wrong will be judged without punishment.

The traveler’s heart is anxious, hesitant,
Delayed by obstacles, he has not returned.
Wait until the days of *yin-mao* and *chen-si*—
Like thunder from flat ground, he’ll arrive in a flash.

The stars misalign, bringing calamity,
But this illness will not cut short your years.
If you find a skilled physician and heed his words,
Better still to pray and thank the heavens.

**Divination Slip Fourteen: Middling Fortune – Dragons and Snakes Entwined**

**Sacred Meaning:**
Dragons and snakes entwined are hardest to discern,
Yet to transform their scales, they lack wind and thunder’s turn.
One day they’ll rise and return to the Northern Sea,
Only then shall the true dragon’s spirit clearly be.

**Plans and Aspirations:**
Two matters weigh upon you, both delayed and slow,
Best to follow fate and keep to your proper role.
But when the time arrives—not long from now—
Even present desires will fade and pass somehow.

**Household:**
Neglecting incense and self-cultivation’s way,
You ask of household affairs—yet nothing holds sway.
If you seek wealth and thriving kin,
Restore the old household gods within.

**Marriage:**
A secret union, hidden from all eyes,
Defies fate and ethics—regret comes too late to rise.
Even if no man forces harm upon you,
The law’s whip will strike all the same anew.

**Lost Property:**
Lost wealth is but fleeting—no need to weep in vain,
Seeking now will bring no gain.
Wait until the wind chills and frost descends,
Then neighbors’ words will reveal where it ends.

**Legal Matters:**
Ghosts and men entangled, seek compromise,
Truth and falsehood blur—endless toil and cries.
Better to quell the fire in your heart,
Lest your whole body bear the torment’s smart.

**Traveler:**
The traveler left but has not returned,
Companions grieve, their bonds adjourned.
Wait until the days of *ren-gui*—
Then your old friend shall appear from the sky’s rim.

**Illness:**
Jade and stone are hard to tell apart,
Yin and yang, cold and heat—no peace in heart.
Burn incense early, offer prayers sincere,
Lest the living become the dead this year.

*Explanation:*
Households face unsettled kin; avoid travel for now. Lost property is hard to find; illness stems from ill-aligned stars. Silkworms and fields yield half a harvest; wealth eludes you; travelers delay. Marriage is fraught; legal matters lack justice; official posts remain out of reach. Childbirth brings worry; livestock face change—all affairs are uncertain.

No sooner raised than their light decays.
Endlessly trimming—labor in vain,

**Divination Slip Eighteen: Ill Fortune – The Crane Departs as the Cage Opens**

Like geese in the woods at break of day,

Now lost wealth brings only despair.
The treasure has vanished like melting snow—
Where now to seek its trace, do you know?

Imprisoned, you regret—yet what avails it all?
If imperial mercy or amnesty descends,
The jail shall open, and the guilty be freed from their ends.

Bound in a foreign land, far from the way.
Gazing down the long river, no word arrives—

**Divination Slip Twenty: Ill Fortune – A Boat Without an Oar**

Drawn by a fair face, blind to the heart,
Wasted are the matchmaker’s efforts and gold.
For fleeting joy in the moment,

No need for endless, anxious guesses—
You know it was never truly yours.
Seek peace through heaven’s justice,
For ill-gotten gains are the seeds of ruin.

Trouble knocks at the door—do not engage,
Beware the smiling blade in small mouths.
Delay in settling matters peacefully,
And you’ll be ensnared in the high court’s prison.

Rank and position rise ever higher,

For ancestors’ past transgressions bring disaster.
Now is the time to seek blessings and expiation,
And offer thanks to the household gods.

**Aspirations:**
In vain you let greed cloud your judgment,
Defying fate with reckless schemes.
When trouble strikes from within,
The hawk is caught, but the magpie has flown.

**Household:**
Ominous dreams stir false alarms,
Chickens and dogs cry out without cause.
Not that the household gods bring misfortune,
But unhonored ancestors stir unrest.

**Marriage:**
Since ancient times, marriages require careful choice,
Rushing brings no good.
Without thought, you act without resolve,

What was lost may not be yours.
Do not blame your poor fortune,
Nor let suspicion cloud your heart.

Moonlight and starlight blend with mellow wine.
Now is the time to heed the zither’s harmony—

Better still to ask those who know the way.
Spare no effort in your search—
Look closely, and it will not be lost in vain.

No need to file a plea—the case unfolds,
A harmonious air enters the door.
Meeting the official, you rely on his power—
Why worry or fear distant misfortune?

Wait for three, five, or eight more days.
Should a noble lend their strength,
Do not grieve or fear calamity.

The Celestial Physician holds divine medicine—
A brief delay, and the illness will heal.

It has not sunk into deep waters or vanished beyond reach.
Hasten to search—divine aid is near,

Why act recklessly, wasting your spirit?
Yang virtue cannot compare to hidden virtue—

Today, all dangers scatter and vanish—

Why chatter endlessly to ghosts and gods?

**Thirtieth Sign: Misfortune – The Moon Veiled by Clouds**

The moon, though bright, is veiled by clouds.
I say to the peach and plum: do not mock—
One day, the clouds will part of their own accord.

**Schemes:**
Who in the world matches your wisdom?
Yet fate resists, and matters do not succeed.
Remain at your lamp, completing past studies—
Wait until autumn to inquire after fame.

**Household:**
Though you intend to fast and abstain, do not begin,
Lest you invite disaster and unexpected misfortune.
Return to cultivate true fruit,
To spare your family sorrow and grief.

**Marriage:**
The past union had its original cause,
But others’ reckless words have sown confusion.
Today, seeking it will be difficult—
Better to return home and wait.

**Lost Property:**
The scheming mind cannot outwit the careless,
Losing wealth, you turn to the gods for answers.
The trail remains—it will be found in time,
No need for anger or suspicion.

**Legal Matters:**
Originally, there was no trouble—misfortune was stirred,
All because of another’s doing.
Once in the public hall, justice is hard to uphold—
Better to settle privately and part in peace.

**Traveler:**
Gone to a distant land, not yet home,
Anxieties at both ends tangle like hemp.
When the clouds scatter and the moon appears,
Then you will see your people and wealth—no need for sighs.

**Illness:**
Illness has taken hold—recovery is difficult,
Seeking doctors brings no effect, your face grows gaunt.
Know that old vows must be fulfilled first,
To avoid lingering on your sickbed.

**Interpretation:**
For the household, only guard the old and be cautious;
lost property—beware of gossip.
The sick should perform blessings; wealth will not come.
The traveler has not arrived; legal cases lose their merit.
Marriage will not succeed; a sixth-month birth brings a daughter.
Official posts remain unattained; fields and silkworms yield halfway.
Livestock suffer losses; the lost are hard to find.

**Divination Slip Thirty-One: Middling Fortune – A Heart Full of Turmoil**

**Sacred Meaning:**
A heart full of turmoil, never at rest,
Seated in body’s ease, yet still distressed.
All deeds and efforts wholly unfulfilled,
Like the bright moon obscured by drifting clouds.

**Plans and Hopes:**
Within your own heart, intentions waver,
Yet others remain unhurried, untroubled.
Wealth and possessions, like mountains, are fated—
Best to guard the old and await the right time.

**Household:**
Why does this household stir such sorrow?
From north and south, misfortune presses near.
Offer thanks to the gods, amend your ways for good,
Or else your furrowed brow will never clear.

**Marriage:**
Sweet words and clever speech—how false the heart!
Wild butterflies and reckless winds are not to trust.
If you doubt, just watch the garden’s blooms:
One gust of wind and rain, and all is undone.

**Lost Property:**
Lost now, you rush in vain,
Neglecting care until too late.
To know where traces lead,
Wait for the mid-month moon’s bright light.

**Legal Matters:**
Affairs weigh on the heart like a knife’s edge,
Better to endure than force a reckless hand.
Though others spin in circles, wheels within wheels,
The game may be won, but the move is not high.

**Traveler:**
You ask of the traveler—still not returned,
The journey home blocked by mountain upon mountain.
With whip in hand and weary steed, he sets forth,
Only for threads of fate to bind him to noble ties.

**Illness:**
No spirits guard this house—ghostly ills abound,
The sick grow faint, their minds adrift in time.
If you seek health and strength again,
Cast your wealth aside in charity’s swift act.

**Interpretation:**
For the household, all is peaceful;
lost property remains unseen.
The sick should perform blessings;
wealth will not come.
The traveler has not arrived;
legal matters drag on.
Official posts remain unattained;
marriage is hard to unite.
A sixth-month birth brings difficulty;
fields and silkworms yield halfway.
Livestock remain safe.

**Divination Slip Thirty-Two: Ill Fortune – Stars Encroach Upon the Moon**

**Sacred Meaning:**
Stars encroach upon the moon—beware,
Small mouths bring calamity, misfortune near.
The sick may yet recover half through rites,
Devoutly pray to heaven, offer thanks sincere.

**Plans and Hopes:**
Since ancient times, fame, profit, and war’s schemes,
Though many plot, few ever gain their prize.
Better to still the heart and bear with patience,
Lest cunning turns to folly, and you’re deceived.

**Household:**
Why do shadows bring repeated woe?
Because the house is haunted by restless spirits.
If you seek peace and safety once again,
Seek out a monk to honor the Dharma’s light.

**Marriage:**
The match was meant to be, a union round,
Yet others stir up strife and ruin near.
If you would see it done, act swiftly now,
Or linger in delay, alone and cold.

**Lost Property:**
Clearly lost to the east, the truth is known,
Though many know, none dare to speak its name.
If it is wealth, it will not be regained,
Even kin will turn their backs, their hearts grown sour.

**Legal Matters:**
The young stir trouble without cause,
Twisting right into wrong, a bitter loss.
Settle this swiftly, make peace now,
Lest you be dragged into prison’s walls.

**Traveler:**
Gone in haste, yet slow to return,
Why does he tarry, lingering still?
Alas, his path is blocked by unseen binds—
Pray for great fortune to shield him from harm.

**Illness:**
The stars align against you—misfortune strikes,
Do not wait until it festers into bone-deep ill.
Perform rites early to cast off the curse,
Lest loved ones weep in sorrow’s wake.

**Interpretation:**
For the household, fortune is ill;
guard against gossip and strife.
Lost property remains unseen;
illness is grave.
Wealth will not come;
the traveler has not arrived.
Legal matters lose their merit;
official posts remain unattained.
A sixth-month birth brings misfortune;
marriage is wholly undone.
Fields and silkworms yield halfway;
livestock suffer losses.
Perform blessings to avert ill.

Who dares stand against its charging might?
Now grasped in hand, its power soars—
A hero’s strength, beyond the common fight.

Not yet has Lei Huan returned it to the deep,
Through countless trials, its edge is forged in pain.
This will shall rise, a dragon in its time,
Its towering horns piercing the azure sky.

**Household:**
A splendid home renewed, its fortunes rise,
Spring’s season brings affairs to full reward.
Planting and harvest yield tenfold increase,
And noble office brings harmony restored.

**Marriage:**
Since ancient times, marriage is no mere chance,
Even across ten thousand miles, bonds form.
Now is the time to seal this union true—
Do not let the pipa drift to another’s shore.

**Lost Property:**
Do not fret over a moment’s loss,
Hasten home to plan your next pursuit.
To the northwest, where paths diverge,
Someone will face you, revealing all.

**Legal Matters:**
Others stir trouble, dragging you in,
No need to doubt—this is no false dispute.
A wise one will speak justice’s truth,
No righteous soul will suffer unjust blame.

**Traveler:**
The sword leaves its bronze sheath, swift as its edge,
The traveler is already halfway home.
If he meets the hour of *zi* or *wu*, his return is near,
Fear not the mountains, though they number ten thousand.

**Illness:**
The flesh may waste, yet bones remain unyielding,
Each day brings weariness, but no true cure.
If you hold fast to loyalty and filial piety,
Why fear this small affliction’s toll on fate?

**Interpretation:**
For the household, all is peaceful;
guard against gossip first.
Lost property—seek it swiftly,
and your heart will later see.
Wealth will come as desired;
the traveler arrives soon.
Legal matters hold their merit;
official posts will be attained.
Marriage will succeed;
a sixth-month birth brings a son.
Fields and silkworms yield great harvest;
livestock thrive.
Illness may be averted through rites.

**Divination Slip Thirty-Four: Ill Fortune – The Ailing Dragon Brings Rain**

**Sacred Meaning:**
The ailing dragon brings rain, fearing the rainbow’s arc,
To divine illness now would be unwise.
Transformation and ascent will come in time—
Best to guard the old and await the dawn.

**Plans and Hopes:**
Before the spring thunder stirs, its strength is weak,
Yet from still earth, a storm may rise.
Though you wield hands that grasp the clouds,
Cleverness may yet turn to clumsy failure.

**Household:**
Strange dreams disturb you, filling you with dread,
Why do mules and oxen suffer loss?
You think only of your own desires,
Not of the ancestors’ spirits in the ninefold dark.

**Marriage:**
This marriage matter lies in autumn’s hand,
Trust not another’s meddling, lest it overturn.
To pluck wild blossoms, tend them with your own eyes—
Lest you mistake them for twin lotus blooms.

**Lost Property:**
Your door is weak, your gate in decline; misfortune nears,
Wealth lost is hard to trace once gone.
To know where tracks may lead,
Look only to the mountain’s front and forest groves.

**Legal Matters:**
In lawsuits, harmony brings swift resolve—
Do not let yourself become a prisoner.
I urge you now to weigh your heart:
What harm in yielding slightly to prevail?

**Traveler:**
You once pledged to return without delay,
Yet now the waning moon has dimmed the night.
The road ahead holds peril—offer prayers for blessing,
And safe return shall scale ten thousand peaks.

**Illness:**
This matter harms the body, bringing calamity,
As malevolent spirits press upon your door, unshaken.
To heal, seek the gods and fulfill old vows—
Lest grief arise like mourning weeds.

**Interpretation:**
For households, misfortune strikes the family;
lost property is hard to recover.
The sick may yet find relief,
but unfulfilled vows linger.
Wealth comes in meager gains,
the traveler tarries,
legal matters drag on,
childbirth is difficult,
silkworms and fields yield half their harvest,
official posts remain unattained,
marriage fails,
and livestock face disaster.

**Divination Slip Thirty-Five: Great Fortune – The Crane Cries in the Ninefold Heavens**

**Sacred Meaning:**
The crane’s cry pierces the heavens, its qi soaring high,
Nine myriad leagues shrink to a hand’s span.
Office and rank rise daily, wealth and fortune advance—
Dwell in peace and joy through the passing years.

**Plans and Hopes:**
For years beneath the pines, it cherished its plumage,
Refusing to bow its head before the rich and noble.
Today it soars into the azure vastness—
Only now is its ambition known to match the sky.

**Household:**
The magpies chatter ceaselessly beneath the eaves,
Bearing news of a hundred blessings this year.
Not only will fields and silkworms yield tenfold,
But your gates shall shine with radiant light.

**Marriage:**
The crane in the pines was ever solitary,
And the Moon’s Lady Chang’e had no consort.
If you seek a paired fate,
Wait for spring’s colors to fill the imperial capital.

**Lost Property:**
Who could have foreseen this loss, so distant the trail?
Life or death remains uncertain even now.
Pray again to the gods for hidden protection—
The tracks may yet be found by the steps and bridge.

**Legal Matters:**
Heed these words of caution—no need for worry,
Though the lawsuit reaches the court, you are not free.
Fortunately, a noble ally lends their strength,
And your name shall never reach the imperial court.

**Traveler:**
I know you treasure letters from home as gold,
But today I bring news to ease your heart.
Though the journey is long, home lies near—
Beyond the gate, the horse whinnies as your traveler returns.

The calamity came as if bound for the Western Heaven,
Yet your hidden merits may still prolong your days.
Fear not the weight of the gods’ judgment in every quarter—
Now all depends on the steadfastness of your vows.

yourself, untroubled.
Lost property may yet be found,
wealth comes as desired,
the sick recover from their haze,
the traveler arrives at once,
legal matters are resolved justly,
official posts are attained,
marriage is delayed,
a son is born,
fields and silkworms yield abundantly,
and livestock thrive.

**Divination Slip Thirty-Six: Supreme Fortune – Fish Leap in Peach Blossom Waves**

**Sacred Meaning:**
Fish leap in peach-blossom waves when spring’s third month arrives—
Only then does joy come with their transformation into dragons.
Seeking office and rank was fated long ago,
All matters now bring newfound fortune and peace.

**Plans and Hopes:**
First present your case, and you shall know:
When autumn comes, your schemes may yet succeed.
But when the Three Yangs usher in prosperity,
Know that fame and profit are ripe for the taking.

Auspicious qi welcomes your door, all things renewed,
As noble guests arrive, drawing close in kinship.
If autumn or winter bring delays,
Spring and summer shall bring wealth and family to fruition.

**Marriage:**
Heaven ordains this bond, uniting two as one—
How could they not be destined, drawn together in counsel?
In clear waters, watch the fish at play,
Then cast your line with care.

The trail is faint, the hiding place obscure—
Do not blame the innocent, for no guilt is seen.
To know when the lost shall be regained,
Wait for the hours of *chen*, *si*, *mao*, or *yin*.

Laughing, they gather in the mountains, a throng of villains,
While the good suffer needless torment.
The master laughs as he steps out the door—
No need for weapons, for bandits shall cease.

**Traveler:**
You once vowed to return without delay,
Yet now you ask me of the traveler’s fate.
If you seek the day of their homecoming,
Wait until the ox and sheep follow the rat’s hour.

Though peril looms at dawn or dusk, fortune lingers,
Do not fret over prolonged illness or the cost of care.
To swallow medicine now may risk your life—
Better to still your heart and wait awhile.

yourself, in joy.
Lost property is not lost,
the sick find ease,
legal matters are resolved justly,
wealth comes as desired,
the traveler sends word,

a son is born,
fields and silkworms yield abundantly,
livestock thrive in great fortune,
and marriage is harmonious.

**Divination Slip Thirty-Seven: Ill Fortune – Crossing Water Without a Boat**

**Sacred Meaning:**
How can you cross the waves without a boat?
The surging tides rise steep as jagged peaks.
In all affairs, cling to the old—do not advance,
For forward lies no gain, and retreat no escape.

**Plans and Hopes:**
Heaven’s principle for man does not lie in haste—
Yet seeing others’ wealth and rank, your heart grows restless.
If you seek fame and profit now,
Go ask the Hegemon of Wu by the Black River.

**Household:**
Why venture out when all is well?
Beware lest fire or theft bring woe instead.
This spring, guard against harm to your family—
Only in autumn may you find peace.

**Marriage:**
Your heart now longs for swift union,
Yet fate and year do not align.
If you seek a partner now,
Wait until the Yellow River’s nine waves run clear.

**Lost Property:**
The lost item lies plainly by the shore,
But you lack the fate to reclaim it.
Return home and weigh your heart—
Perhaps the times are adverse; blame not the heavens.

**Legal Matters:**
Do not submit documents to the court, for it bodes ill—
Lest you be entangled and cast into prison.
Better to withdraw and return home,
Letting wind and rain rage as they will.

**Traveler:**
No need to crane your neck, gazing at the blue sky—
The traveler lingers yet upon the road.

Though near, it seems a thousand miles away—
Scant word, no news, a bitter, gnawing pain.

**Illness:**
Though remedies exist, no medicine brings relief;
Divining gods foretell misfortune’s root.
Return home swiftly to cultivate good fortune—
Lest worsening signs bring spleen-cold’s chill.

**Explanation:**
For home and household, fortune wanes;
Guard yourself with caution, cling to the old.
Lost items remain unseen; the sick linger—
Perform blessings. Wealth eludes, the traveler delays,
Legal matters falter, official posts slip by,
Marriage fails, the sixth branch bears calamity,
Silkworms and fields yield half their harvest,
Livestock suffer losses.

Naturally in accord with the Dao, free from delusion.

The lost item has not vanished into void;
Cast not your idle vexation to the heart.
Seek swiftly toward the southern quarter—
A bystander will speak the truth of its trace.

**Legal Matters:**
Since ancient times, the gifted bear proud qi—
Why clamor endlessly with words?
Ahead, a powerful ally awaits—
Your journey shall not be in vain.

**Traveler:**
Though old promises falter, do not sigh;
The traveler has already left the edge of the sky.
No need to lean by the gate, gazing long—
At the hours of *si* or *wu*, when the sheep arrives, he shall return.

**Illness:**
A minor ailment clings—do not dismiss it lightly,
Lest rising fever turn to spleen-cold’s chill.
Now the baleful star shines down—
Without rites of expiation, safety is not assured.

**Explanation:**

**Thirty-Ninth Slip – Most Inauspicious – Lost on a Mountain Path**

**Sacred Meaning:**
Suddenly plunged into the mountain’s depths, the path is lost—
Better to turn back than linger in doubt.
Advance or retreat, all journeys bring ill;
Beware lest unseen deceit strike from the dark.

**Plans and Hopes:**
Roaming the ends of the earth, affairs remain unfulfilled,
Scarcely achieved, a shock undoes the gain.
Better to cling to the old, drift with fate—
When spring arrives, even withered wood blooms anew.

**Household:**
Livestock dwindle, kinfolk wane,
Strange dreams disturb the twilight haze.
Wait until autumn’s harvest is complete—
Then turn your gate to face the sun.

**Marriage:**

**Marriage:**
You planted orchids, yet how could they bloom so soon?
Who knew the tender grass would not endure the frost?
If you wed now, the union may yet come to pass—
But entering his house, you’ll fear it won’t last long.

**Lost Property:**
You fret over what’s lost, inquiring of the wind,
Yet though hard to find, it’s not yet vanished quite.
Step back, ease your heart—it will appear in time,
Or else stir up a clamor, loud and vain.

**Legal Matters:**
With reason, you may win; without it, you’ll lose ground.
Alas! Good fortune turns to naught in the end.
Seek mediation through another—this brings luck,
Lest you be dragged into the prison’s gloom.

**Traveler:**
If you ask of the traveler, he’s not yet returned,
Yet in haste you glance back—home is already near.
Not that he lingers for love, delaying his way,
But tangled affairs detain him, thread by thread.

**Illness:**
Seek medicine, not gods, to cure this wasting ill.
The sickness clings, yet you may yet escape its grip.
Beneath the Dipper’s light, merit will see you through—
Then even long affliction lifts in an instant’s grace.

**Explanation:**
For households, guard against loss; for yourself, against strife.
Women and children face misfortune; lost items won’t be found.
For illness, make offerings; for wealth, wishes will be fulfilled.
The traveler has not arrived; legal matters fare poorly.
Seeking office brings no success; marriage will not come to pass.
A daughter’s birth brings false alarm; silkworms yield but half a harvest.
Livestock suffer losses.

**Fortieth Slip – Most Auspicious – Wild Geese Soaring in the Sky**

Wheeling upward to the ninefold heavens.

All schemes and quests for wealth will prosper now.
If you act in this moment, seize the chance—
Vigor will bring you rank and fame.

And now you meet again to wed anew.
Yet this is not the time—patience must prevail,
So wait and let the union form in due course.

You rush about, distraught at what is lost,
For want of care, you failed to guard it well.
Now gone, with no way back, it slips from reach—
Only when others speak will you learn its fate.

**Legal Matters:**
I tell you now—have no fear,
Though the case seems dire, it’s not yet done.
If a noble person smiles and intervenes,
No statement will be forced from you.

How many times have you asked the way at Yang Pass,
Yet sent no word, nor knew to whom to send?
No need now to climb the tower, scanning the horizon—
The long-absent traveler returns in the hour of *you*.

No skilled physician has cured this lingering ill,
And family wealth dwindles—do not sigh in vain.
But as long as the bright moon still shines on Five Lakes,
You’ll need not fear the lack of gold and pearls.

For households, all goings and comings bring good fortune.
Lost items are hard to find but will appear in time.

**Forty-First Slip – Most Inauspicious – Falling Flowers on Flowing Water**

**Sacred Meaning:**
Falling flowers, flowing water—both without pity,
The household is troubled, the master restless.
Women and children face sickness and misfortune—
Hurry to pray and beseech the gods.

**Plans and Hopes:**
Once you set your heart on following the current,
You sought Penglai and the Ten Isles in vain.
Unwilling to turn back to your old trade,
You’ll be buried in the wilds, forgotten.

**Household:**
Ghosts and spirits swirl without cause around your home,
Their voices and strange dreams startle the household.
If you ask why fortune and wealth elude you,
It’s only because the path before your gate is uneven.

**Marriage:**
Do not expect this person to come to your house,
Nor let stubbornness breed sighs of regret.
The flowers drift with intent upon the flowing stream,
But the stream, unfeeling, spurns the fallen blooms.

**Lost Property:**
Your family tells you of their worry and shock,
Yet in dreams you wander, lost in confusion.
What’s lost is lost—best to endure with patience,
Lest you falsely claim another’s goods and shame yourself.

**Legal Matters:**
Heaven and earth know the guilt of a heart in the dark—
No need to invoke the gods when trouble comes.
If reason fails, step back while you still can,
Lest you face the law’s harsh judgment and repent too late.

**Traveler:**
It’s not that he doesn’t long for home,
But obstacles keep him far away.
With no path to follow, he gazes all day,
Twelve peaks of Wu Mountain veiled in twilight mist.

**Illness:**
Fate is adverse, the times unkind—no freedom here,
Disaster comes from greed and endless striving.
After the fifteenth, the moon’s light wanes,
And when the year ends, all things come to rest.

**Explanation:**
For households, misfortune looms; for yourself, no luck.
Lost items will not be found; the traveler has not returned.
For illness, make offerings; a daughter’s birth brings alarm.
Silkworms yield no harvest; livestock suffer losses.
All affairs turn out poorly.

Stay calm, hold fast to your resolve, and embrace simplicity.
Now the warm season arrives, bringing harmony,

Crossing countless rivers and mountains, yet to return.
Today, a message arrives like a wild goose’s call—
News of peace spares you from sighs of sorrow.

In health, you neglect to burn incense,
Only in peril do you plead to Heaven.
If you seek the day your illness will heal,
Shed your worldly attachments and impurities.

**Explanation:**
Divining the household, all within are safe;
Yourself, you meet with joy. Lost items are not lost,

**Forty-Fourth Sign: Middling to Inauspicious – Dark Clouds Veil the Moon**

Dark clouds shroud the moon in murky haze,
Within the dimmed courtyard, affairs go awry.
Best to hold fast to the old ways for fortune—
Wait until clouds disperse, and all shall be clear.

**Schemes and Aspirations:**
You are wise and open-hearted by nature,
Yet like the bright moon obscured by clouds.
If only the east wind lends its strength,
It will scatter the drifting clouds, and the moon shall shine again.

**Household:**
The door grows cold, the gate declines, strange omens arise,
Kin scatter, wealth dissipates, dreams unsettle the soul.
If you ask when peace will return,
Only by cultivating the heart and studying the Daoist scriptures.

**Marriage:**
The match was meant to unite in harmony,
Yet meddlers stir up clamor and strife.
An early betrothal is not as good as a late one—
Better the wise endure solitude than rush into discord.

For gods grow angry, and people shun you—no trace is found.
Seek in the south for old tracks,
No need now for frantic chest-beating.

Wait until the parrot speaks and the dog barks—
Then the traveler shall emerge from layers of clouds.

**Divination on Illness:**
Misfortune and blessing arise from no fixed gate—
You bring them upon yourself.
When the seven emotions run deep, calamity follows.
If you seek peace and ease of heart,
Bestow hidden virtue and give alms generously.

**Explanation:**
Divining the household, kin are not at peace;
Beware of gossip. Lost items are not found,
Divining illness—perform good deeds.
Wealth sought is not attained, the traveler has not arrived,
Legal matters are unjust—seek harmony.
Official rank is not gained, marriage is difficult,
A daughter is born in the sixth month,
Fields and silkworms yield half a harvest,
Livestock suffers losses.

All things sprout anew on this day.

Divination and prayers to gods prove futile.
Only if your heart holds deep hidden virtue,
Will its traces now appear in the east or west.

Since their departure, no word has come.
Fortunately, your household’s hidden virtue runs deep—

To know why troubles multiply—
It is but for the lack of blessings sought from the gods.

Yet words have passed, two or three times over.
Even if forced to wed,
Beware—your union may prove but a dream.

Seeking physicians brings no relief—hard to endure.

Wealth sought remains unattained, legal matters turn unjust,

The traveler has not returned, silkworms yield half a harvest,
Livestock suffer losses.

From roots long planted, its foundation stands—
Now burnished, its renown spreads far and wide.

**Forty-Ninth Sign: Most Inauspicious – A Flock of Crows Gathers in Clamor**

**Sacred Meaning:**
A flock of crows gathers in clamor—no marvel,
Beware the slander of petty men in shadow.
Only in retreat may you escape—
Else, affairs shall breed doubt and worry.

**Plans and Aspirations:**
Hope not for lamb’s wine or fine fare,
Letters and news sink like stones.
The magpie’s nest is seized by crows—
All schemes and plots are spent in vain.

Slander arises without cause,
For the household harbors suspicion.
Return swiftly to seek the gods’ favor,
Lest your kin suffer heaven’s wrath.

The lotus cannot match the chrysanthemum’s fragrance.
Take a step back, open your eyes anew—
Do not mistake a crow for a phoenix.

Unaware of heaven’s net, spread in darkness.
Prosperity and ruin, gain and loss—all are fated,
Since ancient times, this floating life has been brief.

Legal troubles drag on, refusing to cease,
Yet I urge you—do not fret.
When dragon and tiger meet in their hour,
Even without strife, the matter shall end.

Gazing afar, news of the traveler is scarce,
Uncertainty breeds doubt of good or ill.
To know the truth of their return,
Wait till the snake and horse meet the ox.

Sudden misfortune strikes without cause—
Surely the dead demand paper money.
Fulfill your vows without delay,
Lest the sick linger long in bed.

The sick must perform rites of blessing, wealth sought remains unattained,
Legal matters drag on, official rank eludes,
Marriage fails, a daughter may be born,
Silkworms yield half a harvest.

**Lost Items:**
Your own carelessness at the time,
Now lost, they are hard to find.
Do not stir up others’ clamor,
Lest shame and misfortune overwhelm you.

**Legal Matters:**
Clamor and idle disputes roar,
Long after, doubt brings ominous signs.
When you reach the hall to judge right and wrong,
A single fright will echo through empty space.

**Traveler:**
The lot is inauspicious for divining the traveler,
The guest’s path is hurried, yet he has not turned home.
Midway, trouble and disaster disturb him—
Hasten to seek great fortune and invoke the Dragon Spirit.

**Illness:**
Affliction lingers, not yet healed,
Sincerely seek blessings and pray to the gods.
If anxiety persists, demonic obstacles arise,
Even if cured, wealth will be lost.

**Explanation:**
For the household: a woman or child faces misfortune,
The self encounters slander,
Lost items will not be found,
The sick remain unwell—perform rites of blessing,
The traveler has not returned,
Official rank is unattained,
Wealth is not gained,
Legal matters bring false alarms,
Marriage fails,
A daughter will be born,
Livestock, fields, and silkworms suffer losses.
