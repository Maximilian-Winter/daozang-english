In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan once perused the *Scripture of the Celestial Sovereign’s True One*, yet failed to grasp the essentials of the Three Ones’ true qi. Thus, he journeyed to the four quarters seeking elucidation. He commanded his chariot, venturing far abroad, with Chang Yu as his driver and Fang Ming as his charioteer, while Li Mu accompanied him as an attendant. Eastward they traveled to Green Hill, where, passing Phoenix Mountain, he met the Purple Mansion Master and received the *Great Characters of the Three Sovereigns’ Inner Writ*, enabling him to summon the myriad spirits and command the host of numina.

Southward he came to Jade Mushroom’s Mystic Gorge, ascending Round Mound beneath the shade of the Fusang Tree, where he beheld the hundred spirits and gathered the blossoms of Ruoqian. Westward he met the Central Yellow Master, receiving the *Method of Nine Additions*, then passed through Kongtong Mountain, where he studied the *Scripture of Spontaneity* under Guangchengzi. Northward he reached the Vast Dyke, ascending Juci Mountain, where he encountered the Great Courtyard Lord, the Yellow Canopy Youth, and received the *Twelve Scrolls of the Divine Immortals’ Mushroom Charts*. Returning to Wangwu Mountain, he transmitted the *Scripture of the Ninefold Transmutation of Golden Liquor* to the Mysterious Woman, then journeyed once more to Cloud Terrace and Green City Mountain, where he met Master Ning.

The Master said: “I attained the Dao and became an immortal, yet I am no celestial official of the Three Sovereigns. Truly, I do not comprehend this text of the True One. Recently, the Sovereign Person was dispatched by the Fusang Lord to govern the immortal officials of Mount Emei, and has not yet departed. You may inquire of him.”

The Emperor then traveled to Mount Emei, where he purified himself for three months before finally meeting the Sovereign Person. Of what era this being hailed, none could say. His body stood nine feet tall, covered in dark fur over a foot long, while his hair measured but a few inches. His dwelling lay within a sheer cliff on the mountain’s northern face, a house of white jade with curtains of yellow jade and gossamer, suffused with the fragrance of thousand-harmony incense. His attendants were all jade maidens of the immortals, and three seated guests, each styled Supreme Clarity Immortal Kings.

Upon meeting the Sovereign Person, he was offered a feast of jujubes filling a peck-measure, served with the essence of cinnabar blossoms and an array of rare fruits, and rinsed with the divine nectar of Vermilion Palace and Jade Elixir. The Yellow Emperor prostrated himself, kowtowing twice before rising.

The Sovereign Person asked: “What do you seek?”

The Emperor knelt and replied: “I wish to attain longevity.”

The Sovereign Person said: “You have surveyed the four seas, yet still desire not to die—is this not greed?”

The Emperor knelt and said: “When the myriad peoples lack a ruler, they oppress one another. Thus, I established laws to transmit to posterity. My heart privately cherishes the Dao, and I have traveled far across the four seas. Now, by fortune, I have encountered a Perfected One. I humbly beseech your compassion. I have seen the *Scripture of the True One of the Perfected*, yet though I have perused its words, I fail to grasp its meaning; though I have read its phrases, I do not comprehend its import. I beg to receive your instruction.”

The Sovereign Person was greatly astonished. Stroking his body, he sighed deeply for a long while before answering: “How did you come to hear of this? This scripture is the first chapter of the Register of Life, the numinous talisman of the Supreme Heavens, the treasure text of the Most High. By it, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight, strides through the void, and the body generates water and fire, transforming without end. The true essence of celestial immortals lies solely in the Ninefold Transmutation of Dragon Embryo Golden Liquor. Preserving form and abstaining from grains, repelling the myriad evils, commanding ghosts and spirits, attaining longevity and enduring vision—these depend on the True One’s consumption of the Five Sprouts.

These two celestial texts are perpetually entrusted to the Lord of the Southern Dipper, who records and seals them under the authority of the Grand Tally. Unless by the covenant of immortals, who may emerge but once every forty years, none may transgress the statutes to recklessly divulge them. Moreover, the Queen Mother of the West safeguards this text within the Five Cities, its outer defenses guarded by twelve immortal towers. It is stored in a coffer of purple jade, inscribed with golden seals, sealed with radiant cinnabar mushrooms, and stamped with the Middle Seal of the Most High. Those without immortal registers may not even hear of it. You are unfit to receive celestial sounds with mortal ears—depart from falsehoods.”

The Yellow Emperor kowtowed and replied: “Formerly, I received the divine elixir from the Mysterious Woman, yet have not yet compounded it. I lack only the meaning of the *True Scripture of the Five Sprouts’ Nourishment* and the *Exegesis of the True One*. Now, by this encounter, I have met a True Lord. If you do not transmit the Way of life, then I, your servant, shall never transcend the world. If I do not decline in years, what use is a fleeting existence? I only beseech your compassion to save the hearts of the common people.”

The Emperor knocked his head upon the ground until it bled and split, fainting away. After a long while, the August Person descended from the grove to raise him, and he revived. The August Person declared: “You are one who has truly attained the Dao.” Moreover, the Three Perfected Lords of Grand Purity, seeing the Emperor’s utmost sincerity, took pity and assisted him, saying to the August Person: “This man’s ancestors in former lives endured famine and hardship, yet did not feed themselves to satiety. Instead, they cut their own meager rations to relieve the hunger of a hundred starving birds, labored to save beasts and fowl, and husbanded their strength to sustain all creatures. For forty years they acted thus, their benevolence moving Heaven, their merit overshadowing the myriad things. The Most High recorded their virtue, and the Nine Heavens preserved their lineage. Thus was the radiance of their fragrant blackness transmitted to the imperial throne, their power extending through generations, their kindness bequeathed to posterity. This man’s ancestors established such goodness—how could we conceal the *Scripture of the True Sprouts* from him? Moreover, it is his earnest seeking and karmic affinity that have allowed him to meet us. You may instruct and perfect him.”

The August Person sighed and said: “Given the goodness of your past lives, why should I withhold anything? Sit again, and I shall impart to you the essential Dao.” The Emperor took his seat, and the August Person first prepared a feast, offering ritual vessels with reverence. Then, speaking slowly, he said: “The parts of the *True Scripture of the Dao* you previously received but did not understand pertain to the blackness of the Supreme Heaven, which shelters the individual body. When the body is made distinct, one may attain long life. Humanity is the most numinous of living things, yet people fail to know themselves and cannot guard their spirit to repel all evils. Those who know this need not seek protection from celestial spirits—sufficing within themselves is enough. Thus it is said: ‘The body of one person is the image of a kingdom.’ The chest and ribs are like palaces, the four limbs like suburban borders, the divisions of the bones and joints like the hundred officials, the spirit like the ruler, the blood like ministers, and the qi like the people. Therefore, to know how to govern the body is to know how to govern a kingdom. Loving the people secures the kingdom; cherishing the qi preserves the body. When the people scatter, the kingdom perishes; when the qi is exhausted, the body dies. What has perished cannot be restored; what is dead cannot be revived. Thus the perfected ones dissolve incipient calamities, cure illnesses before they arise, fortify themselves before trouble comes, and do not pursue what has already passed. The body is difficult to nourish yet easy to pollute, so examine your majesty and virtue to preserve your governance, and your desires to secure your blood and qi. Then the True One abides, the Three Ones are guarded, the body is strengthened, and longevity is distant. The Mud Pill, Crimson Palace, and Cinnabar Field are the true palaces of the Three Ones. If you guard them, the myriad poisons and thousand evils will not dare to harm you. Rinsing the Flower Pool and ceaselessly consuming the Five Sprouts will make you an immortal.”

“My former teacher received this method directly from the Perfected King of the Nine Heavens, and now I inscribe it to transmit to you. When stored in the mouth, it is called the Vermilion Crow Elixir; when drawn from the body, it is called the True One. This is the celestial treasure of scripture and text. At dawn, secretly recite: ‘Eastern Green Sprout, consume the Green Sprout, drink from the Morning Flower.’ After reciting, sweep the tongue over the outer surface of the upper teeth, lick the lips, rinse the mouth, fill it, and swallow three times. Recite to the Southern Vermilion Cinnabar: ‘Consume the Vermilion Cinnabar, drink from the Cinnabar Pool.’ After reciting, sweep the tongue over the outer surface of the lower teeth, lick the lips, rinse the mouth, and swallow three times. Recite to the Central Wugeng: ‘Lofty, lofty Mount Tai, consume the essence and qi, drink from the Sweet Spring.’ After reciting, sweep the tongue over the Mysterious Throat, gather Jade Spring, lick the lips, and swallow three times. Recite to the Western Bright Stone: ‘Consume the Bright Stone, drink from the Numinous Fluid.’ After reciting, sweep the tongue over the upper teeth, lick the lips, and swallow three times, each time tapping the teeth once. After seven taps, the set is complete. Then tap the teeth five more times, totaling thirty-six taps. Next, recite to the Northern Dark Nourishment: ‘Consume the Dark Nourishment, drink from the Jade Syrup.’ After reciting, sweep the tongue over the underside of the tongue, lick the lips, and swallow three times. When finished, inhale deeply through the nose, then exhale slowly, allowing the breath to pass five times or more. The true Dao is complete.”

The Three Perfected Lords further instructed the Emperor: “Formerly, I consumed this method and attained immortality. My teacher then commanded me to enhance it by reciting over the Sweet Spring in the mouth: ‘White stone, towering and sheer, flowing springs surge through the caverns. Drink the Jade Syrup for long life, and your lifespan will ever increase.’ These twenty-two words—you may practice them. Can you persist?” The scripture states: “Practice consuming the True One without ceasing, swallow from the Flower Pool without pause, and internally circulate the qi without weariness. Having attained the Dao, you will abstain from grains. It is not a matter of months before you achieve perfection. The ancients of the Mysterious Antiquity lived long because they never consumed grains, even in haste. The *Great Possession Chapter* says: ‘The Five Grains are the chisels that carve away life, rotting the five viscera, hastening death, and shortening lifespan. Once this root enters the mouth, do not hope for longevity. If you desire not to die, keep your intestines free of dregs. If you desire long life, ensure your viscera and qi are pure and clean. Embrace the body’s flowery syrup, ascend to meet Heaven, and with Jade Water in your mouth, you and Heaven will share the same longevity.’”

The Yellow Emperor, having received the teachings, presented the August Person with all the commonplace offerings he had—jujubes, fruits, pure kitchen fare, and dark wine—vowing not to transmit the teachings. He drew a single line and took his leave. The August Person said: “If you master the Vermilion Elixir of the True One, all matters are complete. To know the One is to know all things; not to know the One is to know nothing. The One is the most noble and peerless title. The Dao arises from the One, and all numbers proceed from it. Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; spirits attain the One and become numinous; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; humanity attains the One and lives. Gold sinks and feathers float, mountains stand and rivers flow—seen yet unseen, heard yet unheard. Preserve it, and it is present; neglect it, and it vanishes. Follow it, and there is fortune; oppose it, and there is misfortune.”

Guard it closely, and your blessings shall be boundless; reveal it, and your fate withers to its darkest end. Vague and elusive—within it lies an image; elusive and vague—within it lies a thing. This is what is called the One.

If you seek long life, the Three Ones must be made clear. When hunger comes from contemplating the One, the One provides its root; when thirst comes from contemplating the One, the One provides its draught.

The ancients prized this Way of the True One, concealing its words and hiding its texts. The One alone can generate yin and give rise to yang, propelling the cycles of cold and heat. Spring attains it and blossoms; summer attains it and grows; autumn attains it and harvests; winter attains it and stores. Its greatness cannot be concealed within the Six Directions; its smallness cannot be compared to the tip of a hair. The hundred clans use it daily yet do not know it.

Lose nothing, grant nothing—thus the One settles in its place. Neither slow nor swift—thus the One abides in its chamber. Be at ease and unhurried, and the One will not depart. Preserve the One with diligence, and the One can commune with spirits. Drink sparingly, eat modestly, and the One will remain to nurture your breath. Facing peril without doubt, the One dispels calamity. When disaster looms ahead, contemplating the One brings life.

To know the One is not difficult—it lies in beginning and end. To know the truth yet not act is the same as not knowing. Seek knowledge without cease, and you shall ascend to the Nine August Ones. On land, fierce beasts and venomous creatures retreat; in water, demons and dragons recede. No being does not yield; no evil does not strike true.

Hold fast to the true and aim precisely—leaking essence means ruin. Feeding on qi for ten thousand years, one ever retains a youthful countenance.

I tell you: if one can preserve the One, the One will preserve the *Highest Cavern Mystery, Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Three Ones and Five Qi*. Thus, blades cannot blunt its edge, and a hundred harms cannot harbor their malice. When others falter, you alone stand firm in peril.

Is the truth of the Numinous Treasure a mere deception to Daoists? Are the profound decrees of the Supreme Sages not to be trusted by the common people? Few indeed seek it—those to come shall but brush against its gate.

Here ends the *Highest Cavern Mystery, Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Three Ones and Five Qi*.
