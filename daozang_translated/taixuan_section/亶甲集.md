### *The Danjia Collection*
**By Zhao Min, the Perfected One Who Descended to Truth of Western Qin**

If a seeker wishes to grasp the principle of longevity,
Examine closely and delve deep into the source of the Great Dao.
Once you comprehend the Crimson Dragon coiled in the Black Sea,
You must then unite the White Tiger beyond the Vermilion Carriage.

The Five Phases converge within the realm of golden elixir,
After nine revolutions, they return to the gate of the Purple Palace.
Having glimpsed the immortal’s realm within,
It is fitting to swiftly guide your descendants.

With diligent heart, longing for the Way of the Inaudible and Invisible,
You may indeed encounter a true person who points to the sprouting Dao.
Recognizing the handle of the Jade Tree in Kan and Li,
Let the beasts harness the River Chariot as they will.

Tiger and Dragon mate within the chamber of spirit,
As time and sun cycle, forming the precious flower.
After seven reversals and nine returns, the work complete,
You need but consume a single grain to dwell among immortals.

Withdrawing as a scholar, blending with the dust,
Roaming everywhere, delighting in celestial truth.
With sincere heart, you may chance upon the fruit beyond the mundane,
Cultivating the Dao, you clearly know the cause of abiding in the world.

Within the black womb, the phoenix marrow is gathered,
Between the two bowstrings, the immortal guest is nurtured.
When the numbers of yin and yang are fulfilled, the elixir forms—
Then you become a dweller within the immortal’s grotto.

Of solitary spirit and lofty art,
You traverse the ends of the earth, yet few are your Dao-companions.
If you can make the sun’s essence dwell in the moon’s marrow,
And harmonize the yin numbers with the yang lines,

Tempering the cauldron with ordinary fire,
Sealing the furnace to nurture the sacred embryo,
When the nine nines are complete, the time is ripe—
The hound transforms into a dragon upon receiving the elixir.

If even the mortal bones are no longer difficult to refine,
The intermingling of Metal and Wood holds the profoundest principle.
Embrace the Golden Crow and bring it to the Northern Sea,
Follow the Jade Hare as it crosses the autumn sky.

With the Three Powers complete, aided by lofty grace,
In a hundred days, the medicine’s power is perfected.
Frequent ingestion naturally extends the years,
Though the vast sea may turn to fields.

Within non-action lies action, beyond action is the action of the sage.
Recognizing Kan and Li as above and below,
Let the Crow and Hare roam east and west as they will.

The elixir transforms tiles and pebbles into treasures,
The aged elixir reverses the knife and measure, returning one to youth.
This Dao is subtle and few comprehend it,
Its hidden meaning resides within the characters themselves.

Having attained the Dao, depart from Qin,
Wildly exulting, chanting as a purified one.
Yin and yang activate to advance others’ work,
Lead and mercury are gathered to sustain one’s own body.

Do not wonder at the repeated inducements of loyal words,
For fleeting moments may slip past unnoticed.
If you can refine and ingest the immortal’s medicine,
It will not hinder you from serving as a great minister in a pure dynasty.

If you seek the land of longevity and deathlessness,
Refine jia and geng to become the king of medicines.
You will command yin ghosts to transform with the insects,
And assist the yang spirit to prolong life.

Fear not the seas overturning or mountains crumbling,
Why worry that the body will decay and the temples turn gray?
Diligently and early, wish for others to awaken with you,
Lest delay bring calamity.

Having awakened to emptiness, trust in its reality,
With wisdom and discernment, you can resolve what is hard to fathom.
The Dragon, clad in jia Wood, ascends to lofty transformation,
The Tiger, crouching in geng Metal, hides within the northern womb.

Within the lines of the Eight Trigrams, the Four Images are distinguished,
In the Nine Heavens’ palace, the Three Terraces are aligned.
From mortal to sage, all proceed by this,
To gather the jade gem from the cold palace.

Though you exhaust ten thousand immortal scriptures with careful intent,
Without encountering the true formula, your efforts are in vain.
The Dragon soars to the azure void, the golden cavern on high,
The Tiger flees to the mysterious womb, toward the palace of Kan.

You may question all the world, yet few will comprehend,
Lamenting that the determined scholar has not yet penetrated the mystery.
Turn your heart early to recognize being within non-being,
Lest the years, swift as the wind, pass you by.

What is so extraordinary about a single grain of cinnabar?
It can transmute a feeble frame into a stalwart man.
Seizing the primal transformation of heaven and earth,
Swallowing it, the viscera shed their withering and flourishing.

When yin wanes and simplicity is restored, the common folk marvel,
When yang waxes and purity returns, the sages rejoice.
The divine immortals of antiquity ingested this medicine,
And no other method reveals the void.

The world does not recognize the gold within water,
Having perused all elixir scriptures, the principle runs deepest.
Exhaust Kan and Li to know whether fortune or misfortune prevails,
Only then will mao and you rise and sink of themselves.

To return to the Purple Palace, first follow bing,
To gather the jasper flower, it emerges from ren.
The verses speak plainly of the wondrous formula—
Seek no further elsewhere.

The scene within the gourd is known to few,
Those who know are not deluded, those who comprehend are rare.
Do not point to the immortal scriptures, expecting self-realization,
You must rely on oral transmission to dispel error.

To prolong life, you must depend on the power of the Mysterious Pearl,
Refining the medicine, you probe the mechanism of creation.
Frequent ingestion of a single pill dispels yin ghosts,
And with utmost yang, the light body soars into the void.

The accumulated virtue of ancestors may bequeath immortality,
For encountering the returning elixir, the power is attested in the text.
Metal and Water intermingle, returning to wu and ji,
When the numbers of yin and shen are fulfilled, the years revolve.

Opening the furnace, five hues illuminate the chamber of spirit,
Entering the abdomen, the three hun return to the Grotto Heaven.
Grasp the hidden meaning within these verses—
Seek not the true explanation elsewhere.

Yin is gathered, yang is received, in accord with the lines,
Harmonized and placed in the crucible, Tiger and Dragon unite.
When the Dragon meets the Tiger, it is like a jackal before a hound,
When the Tiger encounters the Dragon, it is like a sparrow before a cat.

Seven times they shift, dwelling in the sacred realm,
Once they bathe, the divine embryo stirs.
The numinous elixir skillfully transforms the mortal body,
As the parrot becomes a phoenix, nesting in the phoenix’s abode.

There is another reason for refining the immortal elixir,
The true formulas of past and present align in principle.
All speak of ren and zi driving the Golden Tiger,
All tell of the Azure Lad gathering the Fire Ox.

Morning departs, evening returns, circling the canopy of heaven,
Sun comes, moon goes, revolving through spring and autumn.
Only then do you know how difficult it is to enter this gate—
Await the slaying of the adept to inquire of the Dao’s true stream.

Without encountering the true explanation, the principle is not refined,
Your spirit’s labor is in vain, as if entangled.
Once the Red Child departs the mysterious chamber,
You must send the Yellow Dame to cherish the Purple Essence.

If the blackness errs even slightly, the spirit scatters,
Though the six lines are complete, the medicine is hard to form.
I urge you: best to diligently refine and ingest,
For once ingested, the spirit is whole and the body naturally light.

The high office of the Kan position is known to few,
Those who know do not speak of it as the foundation of the Dao.
The mother of gui rides the White Horse child,
The elder of ding loves to nurture the Black Tortoise son.

Within a thousand days, you will attend the Yellow Lord,
Beyond the twelve towers, the Purple Curtain awaits.
Do not wonder that these words are so resplendent—
In due time, the years will incline.

Carrying the lute, bearing wine, the Dao harmonizes,
Carefully reckon: how much is a human life?
When joy comes, seize joy;
Where time slips by, let it slip.

If in water you see the infant’s face,
In fire you should hear the old woman’s surprise.
Refinement can but extend the span of years—
Let the sun and moon race swift as shuttles.

In the depths of the northern darkness lurks the spinning fish;
Hook it and bring it to pair with the moon’s debt.
Lead it into the Yellow Palace to attend the sacred gate,
Plant it in the Purple Mansion to grow as immortal greens.

Bones hard as jade, the countenance unchanged,
Bowels transformed to sinew, nature returns to the origin.
The yin region naturally erases its name,
The yang spirit refuses to follow the three chariots.

Having gathered the cold jade medicine from the Celestial Pool,
If you teach the lofty maiden, she will rejoice.
Together you enter the Spring Lord’s canopy,
Then ascend in order to the Crimson Emperor’s altar.

Within a hundred marks, the cycle of jia-zi is complete;
Within ten thousand days, the divine elixir is wrought.
The multitude who encounter it become immortal guests—
Swallows and sparrows that feed on it turn to phoenixes and simurghs.

Cultivate virtue day by day, and you will meet the true elder;
All empty and nonexistent principles are spoken to the full.
Once you grasp the immortals’ lead-mercury secret,
You will surely know the world’s profit and fame are hollow.

Piling gold and amassing jade cannot compare;
To ferry sons and extend grandsons is but a burdensome merit.
How can it lie in gazing at stars or worshipping the moon?
Only when the Dao is perfected does one manifest the ancient green passage.

Deluded disciples do not recognize the gold within water,
Vainly seeking it at the ends of the earth and shores of the sea.
Know that black lead becomes the supreme treasure,
And cinnabar mercury naturally forms a forest of cold.

The Azure Lad sings palace-mode melodies,
The Kan Mother plucks the zhi-mode zither.
Invite them into the pot to feast together—
Day and night, joy resounds like jade dragons singing.

The *Yin Fu* and *Dao De* reveal the mysterious mechanism,
Every line and verse speaks to the full.
The mother, having raised the child, is to be cherished;
While white remains, do not act upon the black.

Fire gives birth to xun-wood, returning to the fruit;
Water enters the lofty village, reversing to the good foundation.
Though the world’s methods are boundless,
None but the elixir can slay the Three Corpses.

The Dao that can be spoken is profoundly profound;
The aspirant’s encounter accords with heaven’s design.
The blended forms of things all arise from Kan,
The root of transformation lies entirely in Qian.

Each time you refine cinnabar, the spirit is at ease;
Feeding on the purple medicine, the body is serene.
Eight thousand one hundred and three years—
Not to become an earthbound immortal in the dusty world.

The true person skillfully gathers the jasper blossoms,
Making mercury a kin and uniting with the broken caltrop.
The Four Images fully return to the Yellow Realm,
The Five Directions are wholly named the Purple River Chariot.

To transform the decaying husk into a sturdy body,
To nourish the withered root and sprout tender shoots—
This is the method of the King of Huainan,
Who carried his chickens and dogs to the immortal’s home.

Having refined the immortal elixir amidst the world,
Without meeting the true formula, one vainly dwells in the mountains.
Who knows that the myriad things share the same Dao?
How can one believe in the three peaks uniting the two passes?

The black infant displays a jade countenance,
The Lady of the Nine Palaces wears a golden visage.
Because of that small measure in former days,
Even now my temples bear no frost.

The golden elixir that enters the mouth—what labor is there?
It suffuses the four limbs, harmonizing and unblocking the qi.
Transforming form and changing bones, becoming a true child,
Reversing age and halting the years, becoming a youth.

To gather the red maiden within yang,
To match her with the white-headed elder within yin—
Thereby eternally preserving boundless longevity,
How could the vulgar know of such merit?

Among the four great elements of the realm, the Dao comes first;
How can scant fortune comprehend mercury and lead?
Do not believe that drawing out lead makes the great medicine—
They merely speak of burning mercury to supplement the cinnabar field.

Deluded disciples often lose their way in the world,
While the awakened repeatedly attain immortality.
Since ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s method—
Having refined the nine tripods, he ascended to heaven.

Vainly seeking others, yet finding no one,
How many times has brooding harmed the spirit?
Though you know all will gradually turn to dust,
Still you zealously cling to treasures.

One method encompasses a thousand myriad affairs;
A few pellets can sustain a hundred springs.
The poem early wished for shared awakening—
Do not trust that there will be another cause in the next life.

The *Dan Jia Ji* is complete.
