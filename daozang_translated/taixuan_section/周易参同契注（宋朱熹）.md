### *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One
**Supplementary Notes by Huang Ruijie of Luling**

#### **Upper Chapter**
Qian and Kun are the gate and portal of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams. When speaking of Qian and Kun in relation to the cosmos, Qian (Heaven) is above and Kun (Earth) below, with all things between them. Kun’s yin is below, completing the cycle—this is the gate and portal of the *Yi*. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li as the enclosing frame, with Qian’s form as the northern inquiry. Through the transformations of yin and yang, when speaking of the human body, all things begin and end with Qian’s yang above, while the yin and yang of the body and the transformations of the myriad things all occur within it. Thus, Qian and Kun are the parents of all hexagrams, all pointing to the transformations of yin and yang. This is what is called the great elixir of golden cinnabar. Its furnace and crucible, then, are Kan and the enclosing frame, which turn the hub and align the axle. Kun occupies the positions above and below, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them—this is the *Yi*. The positions of the primordial Heaven are: Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, and Kan in the west. Thus, their image is like a walled enclosure; their ascent and descent are like an axle piercing the hub to turn the wheel, descending once and ascending once. The hub is solid on the outside to hold the spokes, while the crossbar beneath the carriage, passing through the hub at both ends to receive the linchpin, is Kun. The heart of the carriage wheel, hollow within to receive the axle, is Qian. The axle is the interlocking of the four trigrams of the female and male. The female and male refer to the four paired trigrams: Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen. The *qi* is the sack, and the *yue* is its tube. In the method of *na jia*, Qian is the full moon, Kun is the new moon, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them. Zhen governs the waxing light, Dui the first quarter; Xun governs the waning light, Gen the last quarter—like the tension and release of a drum’s strap.

Master Zhu said: Shaozi remarked, “Qian and Kun establish the positions above and below; Kan and Li arrange the gates to the left and right.” The hexagram positions in the *Cantong Qi* are all of the same principle. They encompass the Dao of yin and yang, like a skilled charioteer who holds the reins and bit, follows the inked line, and adheres to the wheel tracks. By abiding in the center to govern the external, the calculations are recorded in the pitch pipes and calendar. This speaks of the human heart’s ability to govern yin and yang, turning the hub and axle to refine the elixir. The reins and bit are what regulate yin and yang; the inked line refers to the firing times; the wheel tracks indicate the paths of ascent and descent; the center is the heart; the external is qi; and the calculations refer to the sixty hexagrams’ firing times below.

The lunar phases have five or six divisions; warp and weft serve the sun’s command. Combined, they make sixty, with firm and yielding having inner and outer aspects. The moon takes five days as one phase, six phases as one cycle. Combining day and night makes sixty, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams. Day is firm, night is yielding; firm is the inner, yielding the outer. Among the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—which serve as the furnace, crucible, elixir, and firing times—only sixty hexagrams remain.

At dawn, *Zhun* presides over affairs; by dusk, *Meng* receives its turn. Each day and night governs one hexagram, used in proper sequence. This is the general pattern of the sixty hexagrams. One month completes one cycle, referring to the timing of daily practice at dawn and dusk. From *Ji Ji* to *Wei Ji* until the break of dawn, the end returns to a new beginning. The celestial stems and branches set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late. *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* refer to the hexagrams of the dark moon: *Ji Ji* at dawn and *Wei Ji* at dusk. *Shuang* refers to the time of waxing light.

Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. Autumn and winter employ the outer, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Spring and summer refer to dawn; autumn and winter to dusk. The inner body refers to the preceding hexagram; the outer to the following hexagram. This is also part of the pattern of the sixty hexagrams. In the later chapter, *Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*, while *Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*, fully expounding the *na jia* method. Generally, the times used in a single day are merely the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The line statements contain benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accordance with the seasons. Thus, in harmony with the four seasons, the five phases attain their proper order. This speaks of the differences in practice between dawn and dusk, though the details remain unclear.

Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and Earth are Qian and Kun. Establishing positions refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang’s pairings. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. This cites the *Yi* and explains it to clarify the functions of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—speaking of Qian above and Kun below, Li descending and Kan ascending. The two functions of Qian and Kun refer to Qian’s use of nine and Kun’s use of six. Nine is old yang; six is old yin. The two functions have no fixed line positions, circulating through the six voids. Their coming and going neither ascend nor descend, nor do they have constancy. Hidden and submerged, they rise and fall within. They envelop the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao. By the insubstantial governing the substantial, the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness. Thus, in tracing waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish and perish. Qian and Kun’s two hexagrams have six lines: nine, “use nine,” and “use six” have no fixed positions. Each of the six has its position, yet the nine and six of the six lines are the circulation and ascent-descent of these nine and six.

The method involves Qian receiving *jia* and *ren*, Kun receiving *yi*, *gui*, and *geng*, while Xun receives *xin* in ascent and descent. Knowing that vessels have form, Gen receives *bing*, and Dui receives *ding* in their positions. Kan receives *wu*, and Li receives *ji*, for the yin and yang of the six hexagrams. Thus, by this primal [principle], only Zhen’s reception of *jia* has a fixed position, while all else has none. This is the circulation of the middle lines of Kan and Li, governing the substantial through the insubstantial; their function lies precisely in the emptiness of form. This aligns with the *Laozi*’s saying of "hollowing out clay to make a vessel," where the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.

The waxing of *xiao-xi* passes through Zhen and Dui to culminate in Qian; its waning begins in Kun and moves through Xun and Gen to culminate in Kun. Their vanishing is the absence of position. The later passage on "use nine" in fluttering succession, as the ancestral teaching of the *Yi*, carries this same meaning.

Master Zhu said: Someone asked whether the *Cantong Qi* was originally the *Longhu Shangjing*. He replied: Not so. Later scholars, seeing that Wei Boyang’s transmission mentioned a *Longhu Shangjing*, fabricated this text. Most of it is cobbled together from the *Cantong Qi*’s phrases, though some explanations are mistaken. For instance, the "two functions" refer to "use nine" and "use six," where nine and six are also Kan and Li. The "six voids" are the six line positions of Qian and Kun—initial, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top. Though the two functions have no fixed line positions, they constantly circulate through the six lines of Qian and Kun, like the essence and *qi* of a person, ascending and descending throughout the body without fixed abode. The *Longhu Jing*, however, mistakenly equates this with the voids of *Xu* and *Wei*, grasping at straws to force a connection.

According to Peng’s account, Wei Gong obtained the *Guwen Longhu Jing* and mistook it for the *Cantong Qi*. Master Zhu, however, believed the text to be a later forgery. Upon examination, the *Cantong Qi* contains ancient passages on the dragon and tiger, such as the *Huoji*, which may have existed in antiquity but are not the versions transmitted today. Bao’s view likens it to the *Sanfen Shu* or *Hushou Jing*, though this remains uncertain.

Further, the *Jinbi Guwen Longhu Shangjing* is somewhat simpler than the *Cantong Qi*, yet its arrangement and phrasing are not far removed, appearing more orderly. Its closing line, "The *Huoji* is not falsely made," echoes the *Qi*’s own words. Thus, the *Huoji* may well be the source of the *Cantong Qi*. Words are not idly crafted; theories do not arise without basis. Evidence is drawn from the young, and calculations align with the numinous. By analogy and structural analysis, principles are verified.

Kan’s *wu* is the essence of the moon; Li’s *ji* is the radiance of the sun. Sun and moon constitute the *Yi*, with firm and yielding in balance. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Blue, red, white, and black each occupy their directions, all receiving the power of the central palace, the work of *wu* and *ji*. This is also the method of constructing characters, clarifying how Kan’s moon and Li’s sun unite to form the *Yi*. For Kan’s *wu* and Li’s *ji* both reside in the central palace of earth, while the four directions and four phases all derive their *qi* from it.

The *Yi* is imagery, and no imagery is more luminous than the sun and moon. To fathom the numinous and know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives. Like spokes converging on a wheel’s hub, they turn in alternation, emerging and receding, coiling and uncoiling. This summarizes the *Yi* as embodied by the sun and moon. Below, the text elaborates on the method and the fire phases of a single month.

From the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this time, heaven and earth mingle their essence, sun and moon clasp each other. The male yang scatters dark essence; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, and the root’s foundation is planted. Nurturing the bud, concentrating spirit, the body takes form. All things tread forth from this, and no movement is not born of it.

Thus, Confucius praised the primal chaos, where the virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the void. Investigating antiquity, he spoke of the primordial sovereign; the *Guanwei* established the beginning. The marriage knot of *qi* is tied, and in the first year, the sprout flourishes. The sage is not born in vain; he observes above to manifest the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, adapting to the times with sincerity and trust.

This method of the text divides one month into six segments, each governed by one of the six hexagrams: *Zhen* (☳) as the first, *Dui* (☱) the second, *Qian* (☰) the third, *Xun* (☴) the fourth, *Gen* (☶) the fifth, and *Kun* (☷) the sixth. Each segment spans five days, so it is said that on the first day of the lunar month, *Zhen* begins its influence, marking the initial interaction of the sun and moon’s yin and yang. Here, one applies the work of cultivation, just as the sage composed the Six Classics, each with its foundational origin. This is indeed the essential teaching of the entire passage. The lines *"the male yang scatters dark essence; the female yin transforms the yellow womb"* are the crux of this segment, while all else serves to elucidate this point.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* embodies the heart of heaven, and the hexagram *Fu* (☳, Return) establishes the first sprout. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to lay the foundation. Waxing and waning respond to the pitch pipes, rising and descending follow the pivot of the Dipper. Here, the month is further divided into twelve segments, arranged in the sequence of *Fu* (☳, Return), *Lin* (☷☴, Approach), *Tai* (☰☷☴, Peace), *Zhuang* (☰☰☴, Strength), *Guai* (☰☰☱, Breakthrough), *Qian* (☰☰☰, Creative), *Gou* (☷☰☰, Coming to Meet), *Dun* (☷☰☱, Retreat), *Pi* (☷☰☷, Standstill), *Guan* (☷☴☷, Contemplation), *Bo* (☷☶☷, Splitting Apart), and *Kun* (☷☷☷, Receptive), with each segment spanning two and a half days. *Fu* is the inner essence of the *Zhen* hexagram in the previous six-segment division. The eldest son is *Zhen*; the father is *Qian*; the mother is *Kun*. A later passage states: *"On the first day of the lunar month, it is *Fu*."* On the third day, the moon emerges as clarity, *Zhen* receiving the *geng* position in the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, and the first quarter moon appears as straight as a cord. On the fifteenth day, the body of *Qian* is complete, full and radiant in the *jia* position of the east.

The toad and the hare’s essence—sun and moon’s *qi* shine as one. The toad, associated with the hexagram’s segments, and the hare, which spits forth light, describe the full moon’s complete reception of sunlight. The toad symbolizes gazing, the hare symbolizes emission. When the seventh and eighth days pass, the moon bends and descends. On the sixteenth day, it turns to receive new governance, *Xun* in *xin* appearing at dawn. *Gen* aligns with the south in *bing*, and on the twenty-third day, the last quarter moon appears. On the thirtieth day, *Kun* in *yi* loses its light in the northeast. The segments conclude and succeed one another; the inherited body gives birth to the dragon anew. *Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*, while *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end.

The "seven and eight" refer to the fifteenth day. The sixteenth day marks the start of the fourth segment, where the first yin begins to form as *Xun*, completing the lunar essence, setting at dawn in the west at *xin*. On the twenty-third day, the middle of the fifth segment, the central yin arises as *Gen*, forming the last quarter moon, setting at midday in the south at *bing*. On the thirtieth day, the end of the sixth segment, all three yang transform, and the light vanishes as the moon’s body hides in the northeast—here, the character *ming* (brightness) is borrowed from *Peng* (☷☷☷) in the *Book of Changes*. When the six segments of the month are complete, they pass the succession to the following month. The eldest son inherits the father’s role, and *Zhen* is reborn. *Ren* pairs with *jia*, *gui* with *yi*, all belonging to *Qian* and *Kun*, encompassing the ten-day cycle’s beginning and end. From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, this completes one month’s regimen of firing times.

Master Zhu said: *"In the space of a single breath, there are already the dark of the moon, the new moon, the quarters, and the full moon. The first quarter is the *qi*’s moment of growth, descending from above. The last quarter is the *qi*’s moment of decline, ascending from below. The full moon is the *qi*’s fullness, when the sun sinks below and the moon rounds above. Between the dark and new moon, the sun and moon conjoin in the heavens—this is like using water to extinguish fire, or metal returning to its original nature."*

The numbers seven and eight make fifteen, while nine and six also correspond. These four combine to make thirty, when the yang *qi* is exhausted and hidden away. The *ba gua* array the celestial luminaries, their movements never losing the center. The subtle essence of the mysterious is difficult to fathom; one must infer and verify through signs. In stillness, observe its images and model its forms. Set up standards as a guide, and divine auspices to determine good or ill fortune. Issue decrees in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment when the lines move.

Above, examine the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, sequence the flows of earth’s forms. In the middle, investigate human nature, and harmonize the Three Powers through mutual consideration. In action, follow the hexagram’s segments; in stillness, rely on the *Xiang*’s words. When *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice, the world is then governed. Here, *"Qian and Kun are put into practice"* refers to *"using nine"* and *"using six"*—*"governed"* may also be written as *"ordered,"* likely to avoid a Tang taboo.

What follows, down to *"the state’s origin harms the Dao,"* uses governance as a metaphor. How can one not be cautious in the first principles of ruling? Bind fast the subtle and profound, open and spread the treasures. The essential Dao holds the handle of authority, unifying transformation’s guiding threads. When the lines stir within, good and ill fortune arise without. The five planets move in harmony or discord, responding to the times with resonance. When the four and seven fall into disorder, extravagance and decline follow in their wake. The *Wenchang* oversees the records, while the Three Dukes are held accountable. The hundred officials and their bureaus each govern their respective domains. The sun harmonizes the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitch pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew. Trace the beginning to grasp the end, for therein lies the thread of survival or ruin.

If the ruler is arrogant and indulgent, overbearing and deviating from the Dao; if the minister is deceitful and flattering, acting outside the proper path—then the waxing and waning of the moon, its fullness and contraction, will fall into disorder and misfortune. Those who enforce the law must admonish and criticize, binding faults and shifting blame to the ruler. The Pole Star receives its correctness, at ease and entrusting matters below. The Bright Hall enacts governance, yet the state’s origin harms the Dao. These are all metaphorical expressions, yet within them lie details worthy of careful reflection.

Inwardly, cultivate the self through tranquility and emptiness. The primordial root hides or reveals itself, inwardly illuminating the body’s form. Seal the *Dui* (mouth), and fortify the numinous root.

The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the child-pearl.
Invisible to the eye, yet near and easily sought.
The yellow center gradually permeates principle, moistening and nourishing the skin and flesh.
At first, rectify to ensure enduring cultivation; the trunk stands firm, but the branches cannot yet be grasped.
The One veils and conceals—none in the world know of it.

This speaks of inner matters, most essential within the scriptures.
Yet the phrase *"The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the child-pearl"* is the most crucial of the crucial.
The earlier metaphors of governing at the helm, wielding authority and binding the net’s cords, precisely refer to this.
*Initial rectification* and *trunk standing firm* speak of origins;
*enduring cultivation* and *grasping the branches* speak of conclusions.
*The One veils and conceals* describes the hidden, unmanifested nature of its inception.

The supreme virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through scrutiny.
The lesser virtue strives ceaselessly, its function unceasing.
When the upper is sealed, it is called *being*; when the lower is sealed, it is called *origin*.
The *origin* serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides.
These two apertures follow the method of metal-qi, mutually dependent.

What follows grows increasingly abstruse; here, I offer a tentative interpretation.
The *supreme virtue* refers to the earlier passage’s *feminine yin transforming the yellow womb*, where the Three Luminaries sink into qi and the pivot of the origin operates in obscurity—what the later text calls *mercury as the flowing pearl* and *the Azure Dragon as the mother of the flowing pearl*, precisely what lies beyond the reach of thought.
The *lesser virtue* refers to the earlier *masculine yang spreading the profound, warming and nurturing the child-pearl*, and the later *White Tiger as the father of smelted yellow earth*—the very place where intent and effort are applied. If sealed improperly, all lose their proper alignment.
Thus, the *origin* serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides. The *Canon of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *"Above, the Azure Dragon dwells."* The *metal* here refers to the masculine yang’s White Tiger.

In general, when yang descends, yin naturally ascends.
The so-called *apertures*—as the *Song of the Cauldron* says: *"Yin above"*—are also of utmost importance.
*Knowing the white, guarding the black* is the foundation of water.
Water is the Dao; its number is one.
The *white* refers to mercury, the *black* to lead.
The *metal essence* speaks of its birth from lead.
The *water foundation* can generate water.
White and black, each one, become water and the pivot of the Dao—this is the so-called *numinous virtue*.

At the inception of yin and yang, the profound contains the yellow sprout.
The master of the five metals is the Northern River Cart.
*The profound contains the yellow sprout*: water holds earth, still yet intentional.
*The Northern River Cart*: black generates water.
Judging from the later text, this precisely refers to lead.
Thus, lead is black without but harbors golden splendor within.
Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade, outwardly a madman.
Lead is the *metal-qi* mentioned earlier.
Metal is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child in the womb.
Water is the child of metal; the child hides within the mother’s womb.
This is the meaning of *knowing the white, guarding the black* from above.

The true person’s subtlety is as if existing, as if not.
Vaguely resembling a great abyss, now sinking, now floating.
Withdrawing, they distribute and guard their respective domains.
This is the so-called *warming and nurturing the child-pearl*.

Gazing upon it, it resembles whiteness; refining it, it becomes vermilion.
Tempered into a protective barrier, the white enfolds the pure within.
Round or square, a *cun* in diameter, blending and constraining one another.
Born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted.
Surrounding it are ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s isles.
Encircling and sealing, fourfold yet enclosed.
Guarded and secured, barring all wickedness.
Curved corridors connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen.

The *cun in diameter* is the so-called *child-pearl*.
The *ramparts and gates* may refer to the later text’s *"the ruler of emotions manages the exterior, building ramparts as city walls."*
Yet their exact meaning remains unclear.
They defy contemplation, resisting anxious toil.

Within the hall, spirit and qi brim—none can detain them.
He who guards them prospers; he who loses them perishes.
In motion and stillness, rest and repose, they ever accompany man.
This is no mere repository of right and wrong, but an inner vision of contemplation.
Treading the steps of the Dipper’s lodges, reckoning the Six Jia by sun and stars.
The Yin Way suppresses nine and one, muddling and toying with the Mysterious Womb.
Ingesting qi, the intestines rumble; exhaling the stale, inhaling the fresh and foul.
Day and night without sleep, the bowels never cease their churning.
The body grows weary and spent, dazed as though deranged.
The hundred vessels seethe and surge, denied their clear and settled dwelling.
Encircling altars are raised, dawn and dusk devoted to rites and offerings.
Phantoms manifest in form, dreams stir deep emotions.
The heart trembles, the mind rejoices—one believes longevity assured.
Yet suddenly, life is cut short; the corpse rots and lies exposed.
Every action runs awry, perverse and contrary to the pivot of mechanism.
The manifold defenses are legion—thousands of strands, ten thousand more.
Advancing and retreating, they defy the Yellow and the Old,
twisting and turning, clashing against the Nine Capitals.

This speaks of how the Dao differs from all lesser arts and minor methods,
yet its full meaning cannot be exhaustively explained.
The enlightened grasp its purport, perceiving its source with clarity.
Diligent in practice, day and night unceasing,
after three years of ingestion, one becomes light and roams afar.
Entering fire, one is not scorched; entering water, one is not drenched.
Able to preserve or dissolve, ever joyful and free from care.
The Dao is perfected, virtue is accomplished, lying hidden until the dust settles.
The Great One summons, relocating one to the Central Isle.
With merit fulfilled, one ascends, receiving the chart as due record.

The *Fire Record* is no empty composition—it expounds the *Yi* to illuminate these truths.
The crescent-moon crucible and furnace, the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement.
Mercury as the Sun’s flowing pearl, the Azure Dragon accompanying it.
Raising the East to meet the West, soul and spirit naturally constrain one another.
The upper crescent aligns with Dui’s number eight; the lower crescent does the same.

The crescent moon is thought to be round below and cleft above, resembling a recumbent moon.
The White Tiger is lead, fire, qi, the West, the po, yang—serving as the pivot of refinement,
signifying the downward rush that yields to steaming ascent.
Mercury as the Sun is essence.
The Azure Dragon is water, the East, the hun, yin.

The upper crescent is yang; the lower crescent is yin.
Master Zhu said: Kan and Li, water and fire, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury—
these are but interchangeable names; in truth, they are merely the two of essence and qi.
Essence is water, Kan, the dragon, mercury.
Qi is fire, Li, the tiger, lead.
The method employs spirit to circulate essence and qi, congealing them into the elixir.
Yang qi below first forms water; refined by fire, it coagulates into the elixir.
This teaching is most singular.

When the two crescents merge their essence, the forms of Qian and Kun are complete.
Two eights make a pound—the *Yi*’s Dao stands firm and unshaken.
Eight days bring the Dui crescent; eight more complete Qian’s body.
Twenty-three days bring the Gen crescent; eight fewer complete Kun’s body.
One annotation states: a pound contains three hundred eighty-four zhu, corresponding to the number of lines.
For this is the count of zhu in a pound.
From Zhen it arises, to Qian it fills, through Xun it wanes, to Kun it is exhausted.

Gold enters fierce fire, yet its radiant luster remains undiminished.
Since the dawn of creation, the sun and moon have never dimmed their light,
nor has gold lost its weight; their forms endure as ever.
Gold is born of the moon, at the new moon receiving the sun’s tally.
Gold returns to its mother, the moon’s dark embracing the sun.
Concealing its frame, it sinks into the cavernous void.
Gold regains its original nature, its majestic brilliance rejoicing in the crucible.

Gold is lead. "Gold returns to its mother" means withdrawing and concealing,
the sun no longer illuminating the moon—pure Kun trigram.
The character *xi* (嬉) was originally written as *xi* (喜), in one version as *xi* (僖).
Upon examination, none make sense.
According to the *Shuowen*, *xi* (嬉) means "flaming."
The Later Han often used this character.

The numbers of zi and wu combine to three; wu and ji are called five.
When three and five harmonize, the eight minerals serve as the guiding principle.
Inhalation and exhalation covet one another, awaiting the union of husband and wife.
Yellow earth is gold’s father; flowing pearl is water’s mother.
Water treats earth as a ghost; earth fills water, preventing its rise.
The Vermilion Bird is fire’s essence, holding the balance to regulate victory and defeat.
When water prevails, fire is extinguished; both perish, returning to the thick earth.
Once the three natures unite, their original essence shares a common ancestor.

Zi water is one; wu fire is two—their numbers combine to three.
Wu-ji earth is five. Three and five merge to form eight.
Eight represents the mineral image, yet in truth, there are but two things—water and fire—
with earth as the master.
Earth pertains to the spleen, which governs intention, meaning the mind directs fire downward and water upward,
breathing in harmony.
Gold is fire. The Vermilion Bird likely refers to the heart, also the master of intention.
"Holding the balance" means wielding the scale, governing summer.
This text’s intent largely concerns refining water with fire, diminishing fire with water—
echoing the earlier theme of the moon receiving the sun’s light and returning to its mother.

Sesame still extends life; returning cinnabar enters the mouth.
Gold’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things.
When alchemists ingest it, their lifespan endures long.
Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.
Golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scattering like wind and rain.
Steaming and permeating the four limbs, the complexion becomes radiant and fair.
White hair reverts to black as of old.
The elderly man regains his youth; the old woman becomes a maiden.
Transforming form to escape worldly calamity, one is called a True Person.

This speaks of the inner elixir yet describes it as if taken by mouth.
Its meaning remains unclear.
Elsewhere, I have seen it rush into the crimson gate below.

Lead powder cast into fire, its color ruined, reverts to lead.
Ice and snow met with warm broth dissolve into the Great Mystery.

Gold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury.
Transformation arises from its authenticity, beginning and ending in mutual dependence.
All these serve as metaphors for change through like kinds.
For those weary of ingesting and refining, one should use substances of the same kind.
Plant millet with millet seeds; hatch chickens with their own eggs.
By aligning with kind to aid nature, things form easily as if shaped by the potter’s wheel.
Fish eyes are not pearls; fleabane does not become a casket.
Like kinds follow one another; disparate matters cannot become treasure.
Thus, swallows and sparrows do not birth phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not move downward to moisten.
Again, it is shown that different kinds cannot complete one another.

Worldly scholars abound, boasting lofty wisdom and fine talent.
Yet by chance they fail to meet their moment, wasting fire and squandering wealth.
Clinging to texts and following words, they recklessly impose their own ideas.
The thread’s origin is lost, and their measures and grasp falter.
They pound and refine chalcanthite, mica, and magnetite,
burn sulfur with camphor wood, and smelt mercury with clay.
They smelt bronze with the five minerals below the bellows,
using them as pivotal aids.
Yet these are of mixed natures and different kinds—how could they willingly unite?
A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; what they seek to transmute turns instead to folly.
From youth to white-haired age, halfway they grow suspicious.
Turning from the Dao, they cling to deluded paths, stepping from the upright into crooked byways.
Their vision narrow as a tube, they cannot fathom what lies ahead.
This speaks of those who pursue the outer elixir: if the medicines are not of the same kind, they cannot become treasure.

As for the utmost sages, none surpass Fu Xi,
who drew the eight trigrams, emulating heaven’s pattern.
King Wen, ancestor of emperors, structured the hexagrams and composed their judgments.
Confucius, the near-sage and hero, wrote the *Ten Wings* to aid them.
These three were heaven’s chosen, rising in succession to govern their times.
Though their excellence followed steps and their merits differed not,
their creations built upon one another, their calculations precise to the smallest fraction.
The tangible is easy to measure; the formless and subtle are hard to plan.
Their deeds set models for emulation, establishing for the world the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*.
Without prior knowledge as resource, they awakened through their teachers.
Bright as if ascending a high terrace with curtains drawn, they saw clearly.
This speaks of the three sages rising in succession: Fu Xi modeled heaven, King Wen followed Fu Xi, and Confucius followed King Wen.
The tangible is easy to shape; the formless is difficult to attain.
*Yin* here means they themselves awakened to this principle through their teachers.
The two lines on the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* remain unclear.

The *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters share the same aim.
Though their words are earnest, people do not ponder them deeply.
Tracing their origins and flows, the hidden and manifest originally dwell together.
I await the discourse of the worthy—how dare I lightly commit this to writing?
Holding my tongue, I wish to remain silent, yet to cut off the Dao invites punishment.
Pouring my thoughts onto bamboo and silk, I fear leaking heaven’s tally.
Hesitant, I sigh, gazing up and down, stitching together this foolishness.
Though the potter’s wheel has its methods, I cannot bear to lay it all bare.
I sketch only its outlines; its branches and leaves will be seen in the refining.

The *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters—an ancient text now lost, its details unknown.
Use gold as the embankment, and water and fire move freely.
Gold’s number is fifteen; water’s number is the same.
When measuring at the furnace, let water exceed by five parts.
Take these two as true, gold’s weight as originally set.
The third does not enter; fire’s two parts accompany them.
The two substances contain and receive one another, their transformations wondrous as spirits.
At once, the qi of Great Yang arises, steaming and seething in an instant.
First liquid, then congealed, it is called the Yellow Chariot.
This speaks of the first transformation of the elixir.
Gold and water appear above.
*Enter* should read *fire*, as below there are three things—thus it should be *fire*.
Yet it also says "the qi of Great Yang arises below," which seems to involve only two things.
Perhaps it should read *eight*, and *three* should be *two*.
This refers to gold and water, both numbered fifteen, with water divided into five parts, only two used—six of fifteen.
The three are nine of fifteen.
Water’s two parts—some read *fire’s two*—correspond to the three things of water and fire above.
But above there is no mention of fire’s weight, and below the word *Great Yang* appears, so this may not be the case.
The two substances containing and receiving one another are the union of yin and yang, Kan and Li.
The error of *three things* is quite clear.

As the years and months near their end, nature is harmed and lifespan shortened.
The body becomes ash and earth, its form like bright dust in a vessel.
This seems to describe the second transformation.
Pound, refine, and combine them, then rush into the crimson gate.
Securely seal their meeting, striving for perfect solidity.
Blazing fire spreads below, its sound ceaseless day and night.
At first, civil methods are employed; in the end, martial ones are displayed.
Observe with care, scrutinizing the adjustments of cold and warmth.
Cycle through the twelve nodes; when each ends, inspect closely again.
Qi wanes, life nears its end, rest and death claim the hun and po.
The color shifts to purple, resplendent, forming the Returned Elixir.
Ground to a single pill, the spatula’s touch is most divine.
This is the third transformation.
*Pounding, refining, and combining*—this must involve some other process.
The *crimson gate* refers to the mouth.
When liquid congeals to ash and earth, the principle becomes self-evident:
it is spat out, refined, then swallowed again.
The *blazing fire* is the aforementioned qi of Great Yang.
*Its sound ceaseless*—later chapters also speak of a mournful, wailing sound, like an infant longing for its mother.
*Civil* may be a scribal error for *cultivate*; Tang-era texts often confuse the two.
*Qi wanes, life nears its end*—this echoes the earlier idea of fire extinguished and gold restored.
*Ground to a pill, spatula’s touch*—the details remain unclear.

Expounding the numbers of the five phases, concise yet not cumbersome:
Use water to stimulate fire, and suddenly its brilliance is extinguished.
Sun and moon press close, ever dwelling between darkness and dawn.
When water prevails, Kan encroaches on yang; when fire weakens, Li’s day grows dim.

Yin and Yang consume one another,
their mutual interaction the natural Way.
Names serve to fix the essence,
characters speak of the nature’s hue.
When metal returns to its original state,
only then is it called the Reverted Elixir.
This explains the meaning of the Reverted Elixir’s name in the preceding text—
for when fire is extinguished, metal is restored.

I dare not speak emptily,
but follow the sages’ patterns.
Ancient *Records* speak of Dragon and Tiger,
the Yellow Emperor praised Golden Flower.
Huainan refined Autumn Stone,
Wang Yang added Yellow Sprouts.
The worthy can uphold and practice this,
while the unworthy must not partake.
The Way from ancient times to now is one—
face-to-face discourse reveals its plan.
Scholars, exert yourselves further,
hold these words in mind and ponder deeply.
The essential teaching is laid bare,
lucid and never deceiving.

*This concludes the first scroll of the* Cantong qi.
*(The original text lacks “First Scroll of the* Cantong qi*, with Later Student Huang Ruijie of Luling’s Postscript”; this is added here according to the context.)*

*First Scroll of the* Cantong qi
*Postscript by Later Student Huang Ruijie of Luling*

**Middle Scroll**

The firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun,
paired and embracing each other.
Yang bestows, yin receives—
male and female depend on one another.
Through this, creation unfolds,
and essence and qi expand.
Kan and Li crown the head,
radiance spreading forth.
The profound and obscure are hard to fathom,
beyond depiction in diagrams.
The sage measures and weighs,
arranging the foundations of the mysterious.
The four blend into chaos,
entering directly into emptiness and nothingness.
The sixty-four hexagrams cycle,
spread out as a chariot.
Dragon and horse are harnessed,
the enlightened ruler steers the times.
In harmony, they follow—
the path is level, not deviant.
Deviant ways are perilous and treacherous,
toppling nations into danger.
This mirrors the first chapter of the preceding scroll.

The noble one dwells in his chamber;
when his words are good,
they resonate a thousand *li* away.
This speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots,
abiding in his nine-fold chamber,
issuing decrees and commands,
aligning with the seasons of yin and yang,
storing instruments and awaiting the hour,
never transgressing the days of the hexagrams.
*Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*;
*Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*.
The remaining sixty hexagrams
each have their own days.
I briefly set forth the two images,
though I cannot exhaust their details.
Establish righteousness and enact punishments,
apply benevolence and bestow virtue.
Those who oppose meet misfortune;
those who comply find fortune.
Follow the calendar and decrees,
with utmost sincerity and focus.
Carefully observe the days and hours,
scrutinizing waxing and waning.
Even the slightest deviation
brings regret and harm.
At the solstices, the measures change,
deviating and twisting.
Midwinter brings scorching heat,
midsummer sees sleet and snow.
At the equinoxes, all is askew,
not even a moment’s delay.
Wind and rain fail to follow their seasons,
flood and drought contend.
Locusts surge like boiling water,
mountains collapse and the earth splits.
Heaven displays its omens,
myriad anomalies arise on all sides.
The filial son’s devotion
moves the imperial pole.
Near at hand, it begins with his own words;
afar, it flows to distant lands.
Some bring calamity,
some bring blessings.
Some usher in great peace,
some incite war and upheaval.
The coming of these four
stems from the heart’s intent.
Movement and stillness have their constancy—
adhere to their guiding line.
The four seasons follow their proper course,
harmonizing with qi.
Firmness and softness are distinct,
never encroaching upon one another.
The Five Phases guard their boundaries,
never recklessly expanding or contracting.
The *Yi* flows in cycles,
bending and stretching, reversing and repeating.
This mirrors the preceding scroll’s discussion of *Zhun* and *Meng*,
their morning and evening, inner essence and outer application.

Now, Qian receives *jia* and *ren*,
Kun receives *yi* and *gui*;
Zhen receives *geng*,
Xun receives *xin*;
Kan receives *wu*,
Li receives *ji*;
Gen receives *bing*,
Dui receives *ding*.

The method of doubling the hexagrams:
Qian’s lower three lines receive *jiazi*, *yin*, *chen*;
its upper three lines receive *renwu*, *shen*, *xu*.
Kun’s lower three lines receive *yiwei*, *si*, *mao*;
its upper three lines receive *guichou*, *hai*, *you*.
Zhen’s lower three lines receive *gengzi*, *yin*, *chen*;
its upper three lines receive *gengwu*, *shen*, *xu*.
Xun’s lower three lines receive *xinchou*, *hai*, *you*;
its upper three lines receive *xinwei*, *si*, *mao*.
Kan’s lower three lines receive *wuyin*, *chen*, *wu*;
its upper three lines receive *wushen*, *xu*, *zi*.
Li’s lower three lines receive *jimao*, *chou*, *hai*;
its upper three lines receive *jiyou*, *wei*, *si*.
Gen’s lower three lines receive *bingchen*, *wu*, *shen*;
its upper three lines receive *bingxu*, *zi*, *yin*.
Dui’s lower three lines receive *dingsi*, *mao*, *chou*;
its upper three lines receive *dinghai*, *you*, *wei*.

Thus, the inner essence ranges from *zi* to *chen* and *si*,
while the outer application spans from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.
Therefore, in the morning *Zhun*,
the first yang line, *gengzi*, corresponds to the *zi* hour;
the fourth yin line, *wushen*, corresponds to the *mao* hour.
In the evening *Meng*,
the first yin line, *wuyin*, corresponds to the *wu* hour;
the fourth yin line, *wuxu*, corresponds to the *you* hour.
The remaining sixty hexagrams
are deduced by this method.
This again speaks of the fire-phase within a single day.

Between the last and first days of the lunar month,
the tally aligns and moves within.
Chaos and vastness,
female and male follow one another.
Nourishing fluids moisten and enrich,
transformation flows and circulates.
Heaven and earth’s spirits
are beyond measure.
Employ them to secure the body,
concealing form and hiding away.
It begins in the northeast,
the region of *Ji* and *Dou*.
Turning rightward,
it spews forth sprouts like a wheel.
Hidden depths reveal their image,
dispersing radiant essence.
Above *Bi* and *Xu*,
Zhen emerges as the omen.
Yang qi begins its inception—
the first yang, the hidden dragon.
Yang is established in threes,
yin flows in eights.
Thus, on the third day, Zhen stirs;
on the eighth day, Dui proceeds.
The second yang, the visible dragon,
is peaceful and bright.
When the virtues of three and five are complete,
the body of Qian is formed.
The third yang, ever vigilant at dusk,
loses and breaks the divine tally.
Prosperity and decline gradually shift,
ultimately returning to their origin.
Xun continues the lineage,
firmly securing and upholding.
The fourth yang may leap,
advancing and retreating on a perilous path.
Gen governs progression and pause,
unable to seize the moment.
On the twenty-third day,
it holds fast to the crescent phase.
The fifth yang, the flying dragon,
ascends to heaven’s position with joy.
The fifth yin, Kun’s reception,
binds and completes the beginning and end.
Nurturing the multitude of offspring,
it becomes the mother of all kinds.
Yang’s numbers are exhausted—
once complete, they rise again.
Following nature and uniting with essence,
they turn and join together.
The ninth yang, the overbearing dragon,
battles virtue in the wilds.
Using the nine, they soar lightly,
becoming the compass and square of the Dao.
Following the revolving jade armillary,
ascending and descending, rising and falling.
Flowing through the six lines,
it is hard to observe and perceive.
Thus, the primal constant position
is the ancestral founder of the *Yi*.
This again speaks of the fire-phase within a month
through the reception of Qian’s six lines,
illuminating the waxing and waning of yang qi.

*Ji* and *Dou* refer only to the northeast,
*Bi* and *Xu* only to the west—
borrowing heaven’s four directions
to speak of earth’s four directions,
not meaning heaven’s east, north, or west.

The twenty-sixth day is likely a misprint for "twenty."
"Twenty" is pronounced *ru*, meaning twenty.
On the twenty-sixth day, awaiting the hour,
the hexagram *Kun* governs.
The *Use of the Nine* and below
mirror the preceding scroll’s discussion of the two uses of Qian and Kun.

At the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* governs—
yang qi first flows through.
Its entry and exit swift and keen,
a marker stands, subtly firm.
Yellow Bell aligns with *Zi*,
portents then grow clear and bright.
Soft warmth is sown and spread,
the common folk receive their constant due.
At the *Lin* furnace, branches are applied,
the path is opened, right and radiant.
The light’s brilliance quietly advances,
day by day it lengthens.
Great Frame in *Chou* binds,
adjusting heights and depths.
Lifting, it forms *Tai*,
hard and soft both flourish.
Yin and yang join and meet,
the small departs, the great arrives.
Spokes turn toward *Yin*,
moving in accord with the season.
Gradually passing through *Dazhuang*,
they flank the gate of *Mao*.
Elm pods fall and scatter,
returning to their root.
Punishment and virtue bear each other,
day and night begin to part.
In *Guai*, yin retreats,
yang ascends and presses forward.
Washing and shaking wings and feathers,
it shakes off the dust of old lodging.
*Qian*’s vigor shines bright,
its vast influence reaches the four neighbors.
Yang ends at *Si*,
at the center they contend.
*Gou* begins its threads,
treading frost comes first.
The well’s cold spring,
*Wu* serves as honored guest.
The guest submits to yin,
yin becomes the host.
*Dun* departs from its position,
gathering in its essence,
cherishing virtue and awaiting the time,
it dwells in obscurity and darkness.
*Pi* closes and does not open,
what sprouts cannot grow.
Yin extends, yang is reviled,
yang’s name is lost.
*Guan* weighs its power,
examining the mid-autumn mood.
It entrusts the young and tender,
the old and withered flourish again.
Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout,
burgeoning forth under cover.
*Bo* rots the limbs,
dissolving its form.
The transforming qi is exhausted,
the utmost spirit is lost.
When the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back,
returning to *Kun*’s origin.
Ever compliant with earth’s patterns,
it receives heaven and spreads its decree.
Dark, distant, and subtle,
barriers connect as one.
Responding to measure and nurturing life,
the source of yin and yang.
Vast and indistinct,
none know its beginning.
Those who first stray lose the track,
later they become lords.
The primal is level, not slanted—
the Dao’s natural course.
Change and renewal grow abundant,
waxing and waning follow one another.
*Kun* ends, *Fu* begins,
like tracing a linked ring.
Emperors and kings receive and serve it,
through a thousand autumns it endures.

This divides a month’s fire-phase in detail through the twelve hexagrams,
and likewise applies to a year’s fire-phase.
In the method for a month,
two and a half days form one hexagram:
*Fu* is *Zhen*’s *Kun*,
*Lin* is *Dui*’s *Kun*,
*Tai* is *Qian*’s *Kun*,
*Dazhuang* is *Qian*’s *Zhen*,
*Guai* is *Qian*’s *Dui*,
*Qian* is *Qian*’s *Qian*,
*Gou* is *Qian*’s *Xun*,
*Dun* is *Qian*’s *Gen*,
*Pi* is *Qian*’s *Kun*,
*Guan* is *Kun*’s *Xun*,
*Bo* is *Kun*’s *Gen*,
*Kun* is *Kun*’s *Kun*.
*Lin* is *Fu*’s *Zhen*,
*Dazhuang* is *Fu*’s *Dui*,
*Qian* is *Fu*’s *Qian*,
*Dun* is *Fu*’s *Xun*,
*Guan* is *Fu*’s *Gen*,
*Kun* is *Fu*’s *Kun*—
the principles of their derivation
are spoken through hexagram names, pitch names, and celestial stems.
*Fu zou* is *Taicu*;
*xia lie* is *Jiazhong*.

Washing and cleansing correspond to *Guxi*;
"Middle" corresponds to *Zhonglü*;
dim obscurity corresponds to *Linzhong*;
"extension" corresponds to *shen*;
"accumulated task" corresponds to *Nanlü*;
"closure" corresponds to *hai*;
"response" corresponds to *Yingzhong*.
For the most part, these are forced analogies and baseless attributions, not worth deep inquiry.

The later phrase "for the lord" should be read as "only after studying the *Yi* does one become lord," an error long established.

To cultivate one’s nature, prolong life, and reverse destiny:
first reflect on the end, then consider the beginning.
The body one receives is fundamentally of one origin.
Primal essence spreads like clouds, relying on qi to take form.
Yin and yang serve as measures, the dwelling of hun and po.
The yang spirit is the sun’s hun, the yin spirit the moon’s po.
Hun and po, each serving as the other’s dwelling:
the nature resides within, establishing barriers and enclosures;
the emotions operate without, building walls and outer ramparts.
When walls and ramparts are complete, people and things find peace.
At this time, emotions align with heaven and earth.
Heaven moves and extends, qi spreads and essence flows;
earth is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s abode.
The firm acts and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes.
Nine returns, seven reversions, eight’s return, six’s residence.
Male is white, female is red—metal and fire restrain each other.
Water settles fire, the inception of the five phases.
Supreme goodness resembles water, clear and without flaw.
The Dao’s form and image, the true one, are hard to depict.
Transforming and dispersing, each dwells in its own place,
like a chicken’s egg, black and white supporting each other.
A square inch in length and breadth marks the beginning.
Four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones take shape.
After ten months, it emerges from the womb:
bones soft enough to coil, flesh smooth as lead.
This mirrors the earlier passage on "knowing the white."
It speaks of human birth, formed through the union of yin and yang.
Now, to refine the elixir is likewise so.
All who speak of the Dao borrow the elixir’s name.
(Lead is likely a miswriting of "malt," confused by resemblance.)

The yang-burning mirror gathers fire; without the sun, it emits no light.
The *fangzhu* vessel, without stars or moon, how could it yield water?
The two qi are profound and distant, yet their resonance still communicates.
How much more so for what lies near in the body, pressing upon heart and chest?
Yin and yang pair with sun and moon; water and fire serve as proofs.
Ears, eyes, and mouth—three treasures—firmly seal them, do not let them scatter.

The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming within the compass’s bounds.
Winding and turning to survey, opening and closing all align.
They serve as the axle and linchpin of the self, in motion and stillness inexhaustible.
The *li* qi inwardly guards and protects; *kan* then ceases its function.
*Dui* joins without speech; rare words follow the great.
Once these three are secured as the mechanism, relax the body in an empty chamber.
Entrust your will to the void’s origin, making non-thought your constant.
Proof is hard to shift; the heart concentrates without straying.
In sleep, spirit embraces spirit; in waking, await the signs of presence or absence.
The complexion sleeps and moistens; bones and joints grow ever stronger.
Expelling the host of yin demons, only then establish true yang.
Cultivate this without cease, and the cloud-rain qi will move,
drizzling like spring rain, trickling like melting ice.
From head to foot it flows, then ultimately ascends again.
Coming and going, it penetrates the ultimate origin, suffusing the body’s vessel.
Reversion is the Dao’s verification; weakness is virtue’s handle.
Weed out long-standing filth, and the subtle is harmonized.
The turbid is the path to clarity; prolonged darkness yields brightness.

This passage concerns the work of nurturing the root, especially urgent and essential.

Master Zhu said: "The *li* qi inwardly guards and protects"—I have seen earlier scholars read *nei* as "to receive," and their interpretation is correct.

People favor petty arts, not examining the Dao’s depth.
Abandoning the correct path for deviant shortcuts, they seek speed but find no passage.

As the blind refuse their staff, the deaf strain to hear gong and shang.
Diving into water to seize pheasant and hare, climbing mountains to seek fish and dragon.
Planting wheat yet hoping for millet, wielding compasses to draw squares.
Exhausting spirit and strength, through the year no merit is seen.

To know the method of ingesting elixirs: the affair is simple, not burdensome.
The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to leave man.
Suddenly obtaining Golden Flower, it turns and interrelates.
Transformed into white liquid, congealing to utmost hardness.
The Golden Flower first initiates; after a brief interval,
it dissolves and becomes water, its horse-teeth arrayed in ranks.
Yang then goes to harmonize, nature and essence in spontaneity.
Pressing and hastening the time of yin, confining and restraining the gate.
The loving mother desires to nurture; the filial son repays kindness.
The stern father issues commands, instructing and disciplining descendants.
The Five Phases contend for dominion, each relying on the other to arise.
Fire’s nature melts metal; metal fells the flourishing wood.
Three and five become one—heaven and earth’s purest essence.
This may be transmitted orally, yet is difficult to convey in writing.

You must turn left at *zi*; at *wu* rotate eastward.
*Mao* and *you* form the boundary, establishing the two names.
The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.
Each drinks and feeds upon the other, both coveting the advantage.
Thus they interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another.
When *Yinghuo* guards the west and *Taibai* traverses the heavens,
the killing qi descends—what could withstand its overthrow?
The cat guards the mouse; crows and sparrows fear the hawk.
Each has its function—how dare they utter a sound?

Without grasping the principle, idle words are futile.
Exhausting the family’s wealth, wife and children suffer hunger and poverty.
From ancient times to now, countless millions have pursued this path,
yet few achieve success, rare are those who complete it.
Seeking famous medicines far and wide, they stray from the Dao.
If truly you encounter it, observe its beginnings and threads.
By kind compare with kind; weigh things from start to finish.

The Five Phases overcome one another, each in turn becoming father and mother.
The mother contains the nourishing essence; the father governs bestowal and granting.
Congealing essence and flowing form, even metal and stone do not decay.
If one is single-minded and does not leak, one may attain the Dao and achieve completion.
Those who study minor arts labor without result; those who obtain this method are concise and free from trouble.
From the Greater Yang downward, this corresponds internally and externally with the preceding chapters on "Knowing the White," "Pivot of Calcination," and "Yellow Chariot."

The Five Phases engender one another—this is the kindness of mother and child.
Fire and metal overcome one another—this is the stern command of the father.
"Three and Five" refers to fire, metal, and wood, all receiving the qi of earth.
Another interpretation holds that "Three and Five" refers to the earlier "zi, wu, wu, and ji," though one version remains unclear as to its reference.
Some say it should read "as" instead of "with," and the following "Three and Five" and "One" also follow this pattern.
"East" may be a corruption for "left," referring here to the fixed positions of yin and yang.

The six lines on the dragon and tiger speak of the kindness of mother and child.
From "Yinghuo guards the west" to the following eight lines describe the stern command of the father.
Those who "do not grasp the principle" and "seek famous medicines far and wide" are practitioners of external alchemy.
"By kind compare with kind" refers to the earlier mention of the "Eight Stones as the proper guiding principle."

Erect a pole and see its shadow; call into a valley and hear its echo.
How can this not be wondrous? It is the supreme image of heaven and earth.
Yet if one takes a mere inch of wild aconite or a tael of croton and swallows it, one will instantly stiffen, unable to turn or look up.
At such a time, even if King Wen of Zhou were to massage, if Master Cao were to divine, if Confucius were to read the omens, if Bian Que were to apply his needles, or if Wu Xian were to beat his drums,
how could they revive the dead or restore them to running and walking?

The maiden by the River He is numinous and most divine.
When fire is applied, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.
Ghosts hide and dragons conceal themselves—none know where she resides.
If one wishes to control her, the Yellow Sprout is the root.

Things lack yin and yang; they defy heaven and contravene the origin.
A fat hen hatches from an egg, yet her chick is not whole.
Why is this? Because the union was not complete, the Three and Five did not interact, and hardness and softness were separated.
The essence of transformation is the natural process of heaven and earth.
Just as fire moves upward when kindled and water flows downward when poured,
there is no teacher to instruct them thus—it is the governance of the origin, which cannot be altered.

Observe the moment when male and female mate: hard and soft bind together and cannot be separated.
When the proper timing aligns, there is no need for craft or control.
When a boy is born, he lies prone; when a girl is born, she lies supine—
they receive this from the womb and the qi of their primal beginning.
This is not only visible at birth but also evident at death, when they return to the same posture.
This is not taught by parents; it is determined at the moment of union, fixed from the very beginning.

The Kan male is the moon; the Li female is the sun.
The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light.
The moon receives the sun’s transformation and its body is not harmed.
If yang loses its contract, yin encroaches upon its brightness.
At new moon and full moon, they press close and eclipse one another.
Yang’s form is consumed; yin overreaches and brings disaster.

Male and female depend on one another, containing and exhaling to nourish.
Male and female intermingle, seeking their kind.
Metal transforms into water, and water’s nature circulates freely.
Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot flow.
Thus the male moves and acts externally; the female is still and stores internally.
If one exceeds the proper measure, one is constrained by the female.
The po restrains the hun, preventing excess and extravagance.
Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating at the proper time,
each attains harmony, and both emit the confirming sign.

The analogy of poisonous medicines killing people illustrates how the Yellow Sprout can control the maiden by the River He.
"External alchemy" here refers to cinnabar, though it is unclear what this specifically denotes.

From "Things lack yin and yang" onward, all pertains to the principles of things, clarifying that for this method, the union of yin and yang is fundamental.
The essence of cinnabar is wood; only when it meets metal do they merge.
Where metal and water unite, wood and fire take the lead.
These four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger.
The dragon is yang, with an odd number; the tiger is yin, with an even number.
The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother.
The kidneys, black, are the child; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor.
These three things form one family, all returning to wu and ji.
Hard and soft arise in succession, traversing the divisions in turn.

The dragon is in the west, the tiger in the east; they establish the weft at mao and you.
Punishment and virtue meet, and upon encountering one another, they react with fear or joy.
Punishment governs restraint and killing; virtue governs generation and arising.
In the second month, the elm dies, and the *Kui* star descends upon mao.
In the eighth month, wheat sprouts, and the *Tiancheng* star occupies you.
Zi is south, wu is north, each serving as the guiding principle for the other.
The numbers nine and one cycle endlessly, beginning anew after completion.

Embracing the origin and holding fast to the true, one spreads essence into the child.
*"Guan guan go the ospreys, on the islet in the river.
The modest, retiring, virtuous young lady—
For our prince a good mate she."*
The male does not dwell alone; the female does not live in solitude.
The Dark Warrior—tortoise and snake—coil and support one another,
illustrating how male and female ultimately depend on one another.

If two women share a chamber, their beauty as close as sisters,
and one sends Su Qin to mediate or Zhang Yi to arrange the match,
unleashing eloquent tongues and weaving fine words,
persuading them with sincerity and harmony to become husband and wife—
even if their hair turns white and their teeth rot, they will never know one another.
If medicinal substances are not of the same kind, their names and categories differ.
If their proportions are mismatched and their guiding principles lost,
then even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, the Great One descends to his seat,
the Eight Lords refine the elixir, and the Prince of Huainan tends the fire,
erecting halls and raising altars, with jade steps and terraces,
offering unicorn jerky and phoenix delicacies, holding the register and kneeling in reverence,
praying to the spirits and beseeching the ghosts,
bathing and fasting in hope of some result—
it would be like using glue to mend a cauldron or applying *zhi* to a wound,
adding ice to dispel cold or using hot water to relieve heat,
making turtles fly and snakes dance—only to see things grow more perverse.

"The essence of cinnabar is wood; only when it meets metal do they merge" echoes the earlier meaning of the maiden by the River He and the Yellow Sprout.
The chapters on the heart (red) and spleen (yellow) are missing in some versions; it is unclear which is correct.
The dragon and tiger, zi and wu, intersect in their positions.
From *"Guan guan go the ospreys"* onward, the analogy of the two women further clarifies that medicinal substances must be of the same kind.

*Here ends the final scroll of the* Cantong qi.
*Appendix by Huang Ruijie, a later student from Luling.*

**Lower Scroll**

In ancient times, the sagely awakened embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true. They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, transforming their traces to conceal themselves in obscurity. Nurturing essence and cultivating spirit, they harmonized virtue with the Three Origins. Through the regulation of essence and fluids, sinews and bones became firm. All perverse influences were dispelled, and the upright qi abided constantly. Through long accumulation, they altered their forms and became immortals.

Grieving for later generations who cherished the Dao, they followed the winds of precedent, tracing and illustrating ancient texts. They composed diagrams and writings to enlighten posterity, revealing branches while concealing roots. They entrusted names to stones, veiling their teachings beneath layers of texts. Scholars who obtained these works guarded them in caskets all their lives. Sons inherited their fathers’ pursuits, tracing back to ancestral origins. Yet through generations of transmission, confusion prevailed, and none perceived the truth. Thus, officials failed in their duties, farmers abandoned their plows, merchants forsook their goods, and scholars of resolve fell into poverty.

Deeply pained by this, I have definitively recorded these writings. The words are concise and easily pondered; the matters are simple and unburdensome. Unfolding them reveals their order, and their substance may be examined. Weights and measures are precise, allowing for systematic progression. Thus, I have composed disordered verses, leaving openings like the holes of a flute. The wise will reflect carefully and infer their meaning.

The immortals of old wrote books to instruct others but did not speak plainly of their methods. They assigned names to stones as symbols for the yin and yang within the body, causing many scholars to lose the true intent. Now, in composing this book, I have made it simple and clear, yet still fear its secrets may be exposed. Therefore, I have included many misleading and chaotic phrases, leaving openings like the holes of a flute.

The following verses further distill the essential meaning of the text:

*No image is greater than Heaven and Earth,*
*The dark ravine spans ten thousand li.*
*The River Drum faces the Star Marker,*
*And the people are all struck with terror.*
*The sundial’s shadow advances and retreats in vain,*
*For nine years, calamity befalls.*
*The sovereign gazes upon it,*
*And the king retreats to reform himself.*
*The pivot rises and falls,*
*And the harmful qi flees in haste.*
*The Jiang and Huai run dry,*
*As waters pour into the sea.*

This passage speaks of the calamity of flooding. If the king reforms himself, the harmful qi will cease, and the waters and earth will be at peace. The "dark ravine" likely refers to the Celestial River. The "River Drum" is a star’s name. The "Star Marker" corresponds to the *chou* position, though its meaning here is unclear. The "nine years" allude to the Great Flood. The "rising and falling pivot" refers to the ascent and descent of yin and yang. The "harmful qi" signifies the qi of disaster; by analogy to the human body, it also represents the imbalance of water and fire. Master Zhu said: The "dark ravine" and "harmful qi" may not refer to matters within the human body but are rather metaphorical expressions. The *Biography of Wang Mang* states: "The harmful qi is about to be exhausted." The preceding text describes the disaster of flooding, and if the king reforms, the harmful qi departs, and the floodwaters subside. The character for "harm" was corrupted into *zhou*, then further corrupted into *gu*, leading later scholars to mistakenly emend it to *essence* and add the word *and*, both of which are incorrect. However, the corruption into *zhou* reveals its original form as *harm*, for the seal and clerical scripts resemble one another.

*Heaven and Earth, female and male,*
*Wander between zi and wu.*
*Yin and yang’s ancestors at yin and shen,*
*Emerge and enter, completing their cycles.*
*Following the Dipper and the Celestial Pivot,*
*Grasping the crossbeam to fix the primordial order.*
*Ascending to roast on Mount Zeng,*
*With flames spreading below.*
*The White Tiger leads the way,*
*While the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.*

Master Zhu said: *Tiger* is also written as *Ku* or *Fan*. These three are all provisional names. Since the following line speaks of "Azure Fluid," it would be fitting to use *Ku* or *Fan* here. Earlier texts mention *Ku* and *Ci*, so *Ku* would be appropriate. However, the subsequent line mentions the Vermilion Bird and lists the positions of the Three Beasts, so this should be *Tiger*, and *Fluid* should be *Dragon*. The "leading the way" refers to the earlier-mentioned "roasting pivot." The phrase "harmonizing behind" follows from this. Both seem to refer to sentient beings, so *Dragon* and *Tiger* are appropriate.

This passage expresses the idea of refining water with fire, extinguishing fire with water, and the union of metal and water, returning to the original state.

*The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,*
*Its radiance displaying five colors.*
*Encountering the spread of nets,*
*It is pressed down and cannot rise.*

Ah, the wailing cries so mournful—
Like an infant longing for its mother.
Tumbled into the seething cauldron,
Feathers and scales crushed and broken.
Before half the clepsydra’s measure has passed,
Dragon-scales surge and writhe in tumult.
Five-hued images dazzle and gleam,
Shifting forms with no constant master.
□□ the crucible’s seething rush,
Boiling over without cease.
Jumbled, heaped in tangled layers,
Like interlocking fangs they clash.
Shaped like midwinter’s ice,
Railing forth stalactites of frost.
Towering, crammed in chaotic mass,
Piled together to prop each other up.
Yin and Yang find their match,
Serene and still, each guarding the other.

The Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six,
Spring blossoms flourishing in the east at *Mao*.
The White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven,
Autumn’s awns glistening in the west at *You*.
The Vermilion Bird abides in Spread Two,
True Yang blazing in the south at *Wu*.
All three come to pay homage,
Their kin now bound as dear companions.
Originally but two things,
Yet in the end they become three and five.
Three and five merge into one,
All gathered to return to two places.
Refining them by the method above,
Count the days as prescribed.
First white, then yellow,
Red hue permeating both within and without.
This is called the First Crucible,
Its grains as large as great millet.
Here again is the essence of the Returned Elixir,
Its vital points distilled.

*Zi-Wu* denotes *Qian* and *Kun*;
*Yin-Shen* denotes *Kan* and *Li*.
*Ascending and roasting*—this is the "roasting pivot."
*Steaming in submission*—White Tiger (Metal), Azure Dragon (Water), Vermilion Bird (Fire):
Metal gives birth to Water, Water extinguishes Fire to form the Elixir,
Its form as previously described—first fluid, then congealed, like horse-teeth railing forth.
The wailing cries so mournful—
As before, the ceaseless toil of day and night.
Yin and Yang finding their match,
Serene and still, each guarding its domain—
This is what was meant by "each guarding its boundary, each dwelling alone."

*Chamber*, among the seven eastern lodges;
*Six*, its degree.
*Pleiades Seven* and *Spread Two* follow likewise.
The *two things* refer to Yin and Yang.
The *three and five*—Fire, Metal, and Wood, all endowed with Earth’s *qi*.
*Merging into one*—upon close reading, this should be rendered as such.
*Two places* and *prescribed count*—their meanings remain obscure.

Such is the work of Nature,
No false or devious path.
Mountain and marsh *qi* steam together,
Rising as clouds to become rain.
Mud dries to dust,
Fire’s end becomes earth.
Like the yellow dye of *nie*,
Or indigo transformed to green silk.
True hide turns to glue,
Ferment and yeast become wine.
Kindred natures yield effortlessly,
Unlike seeds that resist craft.

Of this wondrous art alone,
Examine it closely—no deceitful words.
Transmitted to countless generations hence,
Its brilliance clear and verifiable.
Shining like stars across the Milky Way,
Vast as the sea’s ancestral waters.
Ponder it until it is thoroughly mastered,
Turning it over again and again.
After a thousand cycles, resplendent and bright,
Ten thousand repetitions will reveal its truth.
The divine may speak to one,
Or the soul suddenly awaken.
Trace its threads to their source,
And you will find the gate and door.

The Dao of Heaven favors none,
Yet it is ever passed to the worthy.
The text’s pointers are clear—
If the scholar reads it a thousand times, ten thousand times,
Understanding will come as if the divine had spoken.
Dong Yu said: "Read a book a thousand times, and its meaning will appear of itself."
Again he said: "Ponder it, ponder it, and ponder again;
If pondering fails, ghosts and spirits will teach you—
Not by their power, but by the extremity of your spirit."
No false words here.

**Five Correlations**
This chapter comprises five sections:
1. *Can Tong* (The Kinship of the Three)
2. *Tai Yi* (The Great Change)
3. *Xiang Bi* (Resembling That)
4. *Kuai Tu* (The Kuai Diagram)
5. *Wei Shi* (Entrusting the Times)

*The Kinship of the Three* expounds broadly,
Yet cannot maintain purity or unity;
Its subtleties remain incomplete,
Gaps and omissions like scattered mist.
Now I have compiled and supplemented,
Filling lacunae, polishing obscurities,
Drawing connections to bridge the distance,
Harmonizing intent, ensuring no contradictions.
Thus I have composed this,
Entitled *Five Correlations*—
For the *Great Change* encompasses all,
Its nature and essence fully expressed.

The nature and essence of the *Great Change*
Each adheres to its measure.
The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi probe deeply,
Refined and ready for application.
The work of the furnace and fire is truly grounded:
Three paths from one, all emerging from the same road.
Branches, stems, flowers, leaves,
Fruits hanging in abundance—
Yet all depend on the root,
Never losing their original purity.

The words spoken with sincerity are examined and without error.
Like the mid-winter solstice, when bamboo and trees wither and decay,
Assisting yang to instruct merchants and travelers,
The lord deeply conceals himself.
Following the seasons and adhering to the celestial cycles,
One seals the mouth and refrains from speech.
The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless,
The *Great Mystery* without form or appearance.
Empty and still, it cannot be perceived,
Its boundaries dissolving into nothingness.
Errors and missteps lose the thread of affairs,
Words return to harm oneself.
I distinguish and arrange these *Four Images*
To enlighten later generations, blind as they are.
These words speak of the interval between darkness and dawn,
The time of primordial chaos, when forms lie hidden.
The *Great Mystery* in its original formlessness,
The highest virtue like water,
The image of the *True One*, difficult to depict.

The *Four Images* remain obscure.
A rustic from the state of Kuai, a withered scholar from a secluded valley—
Master Zhu says: "Lord Wei was in fact from Shangyu; it should read *Kuaiji*.
Perhaps Wei used *Yu* as a veiled reference."
He embraced simplicity and plainness,
Unmoved by power or glory.
Dwelling in obscurity and humble quarters,
He disregarded fame and renown.
Holding fast to tranquility and detachment,
He longed for an era of peace and stability.
A wanderer in distant Yan, he composed this text,
Singing of the *Great Change*, the legacy of the Three Sages.
Examining its purport,
All is unified in a single order.
Its purpose lies in following principle,
Illuminating the spirit.
Through spiritual transformation, all flows freely,
Bringing peace to the four seas.
Presented as a calendar for all ages,
A path for ten thousand generations to follow.
Arranged to govern the realm,
Its practice is effortless.
Drawing inward to cultivate nature,
Aligning with the naturalness of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
Abundant in virtue and power,
Returning to the root, reverting to the origin.
It lies near in my heart,
Never apart from this very body.
Embracing the One without release,
One may endure forever.
Paired with dietary practices,
Yin and yang are arrayed.
Refined cinnabar from Wudu,
The eight minerals cast aside.
Carefully applied, they bring success,
Cherished by the worldly.
Three paths are laid out,
Branches and stems interconnected.
Same in origin yet different in name,
All emerge from a single gate.
Not merely an accumulation of lines,
But harmonious and refined prose.
Indeed, it holds truth,
Its coarse grains worthy of contemplation.
If I were to embellish falsehoods,
I would only incur superfluous faults.
Entitled *The Kinship of the Three*,
Its subtleties glimpsed at the outset.
Few words yet profound meaning,
Later generations ought to uphold it.
Abandoning the times to avoid harm,
Taking refuge in the mountains and hills.
Wandering the vast and desolate,
Neighboring ghosts and spirits.
Transforming form to become immortal,
Merging into silence without sound.
Once in a hundred generations,
Roaming among mortals.
Spreading wings like a bird,
Soaring east, west, south, and north.

Tang endured hardship,
Drought and flood dividing the land.
Branches and leaves withered and yellow,
Losing their flourishing splendor.
The virtuous support one another,
Secure and steadfast, they may attain long life.

**Ode to the Cauldron**
Three and five in a circle, one *cun* and one *fen*.
The mouth four and eight, the lips two *cun*.
Two *chi* in length, thickness evenly distributed.
The belly three *qi*, seated and warmly suspended.
*(Two chi, or perhaps one chi and two; Peng Xiao interprets it as two chi.
Three qi, or perhaps qi three.)*
*(Note: Qi here means navel.)*
Yin above, yang rushing below.
These two lines are the essential method.
Head and tail martial, the center civil.
Yin fire white, yellow lead of the teeth.
The two sevens’ orifices assist and support.
Gallbladder, principle, brain—settling the ascent of the *Mystery*.
The child resides in the center, secure and preserved.
Coming and going in play, never leaving the gate.
Gradually growing great, nature and disposition pure.
Returning to the One, reverting to the original source.
After one full cycle, the toil is intense.
Guard it closely, do not fall into confusion.
The path is distant, the depths profoundly mysterious.
If you attain this, you will comprehend Heaven and Earth.
Those who delight in the Dao seek its root.
Examine the five phases, determine the weights and measures.
Contemplate it carefully, no need for debate.
Guard it deeply, do not transmit it in writing.

Mount the white crane, ride the dragon’s scales.
Roam the Great Void, pay homage to the Immortal Lord.
Receive the celestial chart, be named a *True Person*.

**Eulogy**
*The Kinship of the Three* is crude in language yet vast in Dao,
Subtle in speech yet profound in meaning.
It arrays the Five Emperors to establish enterprise,
Aligns with the Three Sovereigns to govern the realm.
If lord and minister diverge in rank,
High and low lack standard,
Ordering governance by this,
Peace will not be attained.

Practicing its methods through ingestion does not grant immortality; studying it to cultivate one’s nature does not prolong life. Yet when it comes to dissecting yin and yang, balancing their weights and measures, observing the waxing and waning of the moon, and forming images from the eight trigrams—when male and female interact, when hardness and softness move and rest, when grains and salts are apportioned—all is attested by the classics, and the intent is vigorous indeed. Thus, laws were established to transmit this to later worthies. Only those who comprehend the Great Image will surely attain longevity; those who strengthen themselves and benefit their bodies through this Dao must apply their minds with utmost care.

This appears to be the preface to a commentary, written by a later hand, for the original commentary is lost while the preface remains. The term "establishing laws" here refers to composing the commentary, with the characters altered through transcription errors.

Master Zhu said: Some call it the *Postface*, others the *Eulogy of Master Wei*. Its content and intent clearly mark it as the postface to the commentary. Peng Xiao’s preface states that Master Wei secretly showed it to Xu, an official in Qingzhou, instructing him to annotate it; Xu concealed his name and wrote the commentary. This may well be Xu’s own words, for the commentary itself no longer survives.

The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* was composed by Wei Boyang. Master Wei lived during the Later Han. The title of the work likely imitates the style of apocryphal texts, its language and rhymes ancient, profound, and difficult to grasp. Superficial readers have rashly altered it, resulting in more errors than in other texts. Now, collating various versions to correct and align them, many passages remain obscure and unresolved; what is known has been compiled into a definitive edition. All variants are preserved here to aid further verification.

By Kongtong Daoist Zou Xin.

*Note*: The name "Zou Xin" was borrowed by Master Zhu as a pseudonym. "Zou" was originally the state of Zhu in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. In the *Record of Music*, "Heaven and Earth rejoice in union," Zheng’s commentary reads: "‘Rejoice’ should be ‘radiance.’"

Master Zhu said: According to the *Wei Shu*, the text begins with the four trigrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* as the bellows and furnace; next, it discusses the sixty trigrams from *Zhun* to *Meng* to illustrate the progression of daily practice; then, it addresses the six *Na Jia* trigrams to show the waxing and waning of monthly practice; finally, it presents the twelve sovereign trigrams, dividing the six *Na Jia* trigrams into pairs. Internally, it details the lunar phases, while externally, it encompasses the workings of the year—this is how it draws upon the *Yi* for its explanations, without ever mentioning the three hundred eighty-four lines.

The fire-times methods transmitted today take the three hundred eighty-four lines as the count for one celestial cycle, assigning one line per day. Since the lines outnumber the days, four trigrams and twenty-four lines are omitted, to be gradually added upon the arrival of the twenty-four solar terms. This already deviates from the natural harmony of the system. Moreover, the lines used each day, whether yin or yang, follow no fixed order, making it unclear how the practice distinguishes stages. Furthermore, within a single day, the count completes a full cycle of three hundred sixty, yet only one line is added per solar term—disproportionate in weight and measure. The twenty-four additions increase gradually, while reductions are abrupt, lacking the rhythm of cyclical ebb and flow. This is likely a later invention, not Master Wei’s original intent.

The central focus of this work lies in the two trigrams *Kan* and *Li*. If one grasps their essential principles, the timing and progression of practice—unaddressed by Master Wei—can be deduced through reason. As long as the periods of advance and retreat are not misaligned, one may proceed without rigid adherence to old interpretations. Thus, I have devised a method based on counting the stalks, which appears orderly and rational. Though Master Wei did not mention it, this approach is rough but grounded in principle.

The year is divided into twelve trigrams, each governing two and a half days. Each trigram’s lines are matched with its corresponding stalk count. From the *Guan* trigram in the eighth month to the *Tai* trigram in the first month, yang uses twenty-eight stalks of youth, and yin uses twenty-four stalks of age. From the *Dazhuang* trigram in the fourth month to the *Pi* trigram in the seventh month, yang uses thirty-six stalks of age, and yin uses twenty-two stalks of youth. Yang flows with focused attention, while yin rests in profound stillness. One line suffices to represent one cycle of opening and closing qi. The twelve trigrams of rest complete one month’s work, and twelve months complete one year’s cycle, repeating endlessly without surplus or deficit. The calculations are illustrated in a diagram, which I intended to discuss with Jitong, but before I could send it, he passed away.

Note: Given the constraints, annotations marked with # in the original (e.g., #1, #2) are preserved as part of the text but not expanded upon, as they refer to variant characters or textual notes rather than translatable content.

Observe: In his earlier works, Master Zhu never followed the crowd or carelessly attached himself to the followers of the sages. For instance, he regarded the *Book of Changes of the Hemp-Clad Master* as a work by Dai Shiyu and the *Book of Changes of Guan Ziming* as a forgery by Ruan Yi. Such was his rigor in transmitting truth. Yet, concerning the *Cantong Qi*, he uttered not a single word of doubt or suspicion. Moreover, his exegesis of the *Book of Changes* drew heavily from Master Shao. He himself remarked: "Master Shao’s insights derive from [Chen] Xiyi, whose lineage traces back to the *Cantong Qi*." Thus, he accorded it the highest esteem.

He once said: "I see it all so clearly in my mind’s eye, yet I find no place to begin." Again, he stated: "Only now do I grasp its general outline, but I have yet to fathom its workings or key points." In the *ding-si* year of the Qingyuan era (1207), when Cai Jitong was assigned to Daozhou, they parted ways. Jitong stayed the night at Hanquan, and together they collated the *Cantong Qi* through the night without sleep. Alas! Such was the bond between master and disciple—unshaken even in adversity—that they devoted themselves so earnestly to the *Cantong*. Their resolve to transcend worldly conventions was thus firmly settled.

The following year, Jitong passed away. Later, I obtained the method of stalk calculations, but regretted that I could not discuss it with him. Two years thereafter, the Master himself departed. Nevertheless, the two texts—the *Cantong Qi* and the *Yinfu Jing*—were first transmitted by this master and disciple, and their teachings do not contradict those of the sages. Thus, they are trustworthy. For this reason, I have compiled this work, placing them after the *Taiji* and *Xiantian* diagrams. How could there be any doubt?

The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Volume Three, concludes.

**Appendix by Huang Ruijie of Luling:**
The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, as recorded in the *Preface to the Exegesis* by Peng Xiao of the Five Dynasties period, states: Wei Boyang, a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji, cultivated the Dao in seclusion, nurturing his will in emptiness and non-being. Proficient in literature and versed in apocrypha, he obtained the *Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its profound principles. Thereupon, he synthesized the *Book of Changes* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters, later adding a supplementary chapter, *Supplementing Omissions and Rectifying Errors*. His exposition often employs allegory and metaphor, veiling and revealing meaning through varied diction.

He secretly imparted it to Xu, an Attendant in Qingzhou, who then concealed his name to annotate it. During the reign of Emperor Huan, Boyang transmitted it to his fellow townsman, Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it circulated in the world. *Can* means "to intermingle"; *tong*, "to unify"; *qi*, "to harmonize"—signifying that its principles align and harmonize with those of the *Book of Changes*. The text borrows the analogy of ruler and minister to elucidate inner and outer, pairs the *Li* and *Kan* trigrams to directly indicate mercury and lead, arrays the *Qian* and *Kun* trigrams to establish the measure of the cauldron, and clarifies them as father and mother. It preserves the beginning and end, unites husband and wife to constrain their union, compares them to male and female to manifest generation, analyzes them into yin and yang, guides them through cycles of reversal, illustrates them with the dark and new moons, connects them to ascent and descent, pairs them with the hexagrams and lines to manifest transformation, follows the handle of the Dipper, adopts the circumpolar stars, divides them into dawn and dusk, and illuminates them with the clepsydra. All these are expounded through the imagery of the *Book of Changes*; hence, it is titled the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.

According to the *Cantong Qi*, there exist nineteen annotated editions in thirty-one volumes, as cataloged in Zheng Qiao’s *Bibliographic Treatise* under the *Yiwen Lue*. Peng Xiao’s edition is the most widely transmitted. However, he divided the three volumes into ninety chapters to correspond with the yang nine, and appended the *Song of the Cauldron* as one chapter to match the water one. Such forced parallels are of this nature. This imitates the division of the *Laozi* into the Upper and Lower Canons of eighty-one chapters by the Master of the River, though in truth, it is not so.

Mr. Bao remarked: Peng’s edition, altered by shallow scholars of recent times, contains errors and omissions in both palace archives and private copies, leaving one at a loss as to which to follow. Master Zhu examined and corrected the text, citing evidence to establish its authentic version. I dare not further encumber it with extraneous interpretations.

Master Zhu said: "The *Cantong Qi* was not originally intended to elucidate the *Book of Changes*. It merely borrows the method of *na jia* to embed its guidelines for practice and retreat. In the past, I often wished to study it, but lacking transmission, I could find no entry point and dared not lightly discuss it. However, its *na jia* method is the same as the divination technique of Jing Fang transmitted today, as seen in the *Fire Pearl Forest*. The references to *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* pertain to the moon’s appearances at dusk and dawn, not to the division of the six hexagrams by direction."

Though this was not established to elucidate the *Book of Changes*, the *Changes* encompasses all things. If it forms a coherent system of its own, capable of being extended and understood, then it poses no harm to the *Changes*.

Master Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* may trace its lineage to the teachings of Master Xiyi. The Precelestial Chart corresponds with the *na yin* system, and Cai Jitong observed its alignment with the *Cantong Qi*. Viewed through the chart: *Kun* holds the interval of *Fu* as the new moon; *Zhen* marks the third day, when the first yang arises; the eighth day is *Dui*, the moon’s first quarter; the fifteenth day is *Qian*; the eighteenth day is *Xun*, when the first yin arises; the twenty-third day is *Gen*, the moon’s last quarter. *Kan* and *Li* represent the sun and moon, hence they are not used. The *Cantong Qi* takes *Kan* and *Li* as the elixir, while the rest serve as the firing times.

Master Shao expounded the Precelestial Chart, which was transmitted from Master Xiyi, who in turn received it from an earlier lineage. These were the techniques of the fangshi, employed in cultivation—precisely what the *Cantong Qi* describes.

The *Cantong Qi* is exquisitely written, likely composed by a master of prose from the Later Han. Its diction is rooted in ancient texts, beyond the comprehension of modern readers, which is why it has been so widely misinterpreted. Numerous versions circulate, one of which states:
*A thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing—*
*Ten thousand transformations will then be witnessed.*
*At times the numinous may reveal itself to man—*
*Suddenly the soul awakens in sudden enlightenment.*
Through prolonged recitation, the essential meaning and key principles naturally emerge.

Master Liu of Xuqi remarked: "Among ancient texts, only the *Cantong Qi* resembles pre-Qin prose."
