### **Preface to *Explication of Doubts in the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*** #1**
**By Quanyangzi Yu Yan of the Línwū Mountain**

The world transmits the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* in three chapters—upper, middle, and lower. When read together, its words appear disordered, and it cannot originally be divided into sections. Peng Zhenyi thus provided annotations, incorporating Wei Gong’s *Postscript* and dividing the text into ninety chapters to correspond to the nine transformations of the fire-phase. Additionally, he appended the *Song of the Cauldron and Vessel* to align with the attainment of the True Lead’s singularity.

Elders have noted that the language and rhymes of this work are archaic and profoundly refined, making it difficult to comprehend. Superficial readers, in their ignorance, recklessly alter the text, resulting in even more errors than in other books. Peng’s division into chapters and explication of meanings truly aids the authentic classic. However, in following erroneous interpretations or extracting isolated passages, the overarching principles may be clarified, yet the ancient text becomes fragmented. For instance, phrases such as *"The Changes unify the heart of Heaven—how could one not be cautious?"*—which should logically connect to the following text—are arbitrarily severed as the concluding line of a chapter in Peng’s edition, disrupting coherence. Such missteps in Peng’s annotations stem from later shallow scholars’ reckless revisions.

Furthermore, there are misplaced passages. For example, the chapter *"Like the midwinter node"* should not appear beneath *"Examine carefully and avoid error,"* nor should the chapter *"Like an egg"* be placed under *"Each dwells in solitude."* Chen Baoyi once relocated the *"Like the midwinter node"* chapter before *"The child turns to the right,"* but this was still incorrect. Zheng Xuyi’s collation, though claimed to be meticulous, also contains errors. For instance, *"Mutually engaging at the center"* (where metal and water conjoin, neighboring the ghostly) should not have been altered—yet Zheng changed *"center"* to *"noon,"* *"water"* to *"wood,"* and *"ghost"* to *"immortal,"* straying far from the original meaning. Nevertheless, his corrections—such as *"dark dawn"* to *"dim dawn,"* *"drum below"* to *"smelting,"* and *"powder"* to *"ingest"*—were reasonable.

I have collated various editions, all derived from the careful revisions of earlier scholars, yet significant errors persist. For example, *"The three and five unite in Danger-One, all converging in One Place"* refers to the qi of the three constellations—Fang (six), Zhang (two), and Mao (seven)—gathering in the northern quadrant of *Danger-One*, coalescing into a single locus. Older editions mistakenly render *"Danger-One"* as *"one"* and *"converge in One"* as *"converge in two,"* not only distorting Wei Gong’s intent but also defying logic. This error arose from the misreading of *"Danger-One"* as *"one,"* leading to the false assumption of redundancy and subsequent miscorrection.

As for *"supplementing omissions and filling gaps,"* these are Wei Gong’s own words in his preface. The *"supplementing of omissions"* refers to the *Song of the Cauldron and Vessel*. Fearing that the main text might still contain lacunae, Wei Gong composed this piece to fill them. For instance, the principles of *"martial at the head and tail, civil in the center,"* *"nourishing the brain,"* and *"ascending the mysterious"* are not explicitly stated in the main text but are expounded in this song.

Upon examining several lines in his preface, I find his name subtly embedded within them. The opening line also highlights the four characters *"Cantong Qi,"* confirming that this chapter is Wei Gong’s own preface. In Peng’s annotated edition, however, this preface is placed *after* the *Song of the Cauldron and Vessel*. Peng, finding the *Song*’s language and logic fragmented and its verses disjointed—unable to be divided into chapters—relocated the preface to the end of the three main chapters, partitioning it into ninety sections to correspond to the *"nine yangs."* He relegated the *Song* to the rear, aligning it with the *"one water,"* thus initiating the error of inversion.

The *"Five Mutual Resemblances"* are not five but three. The *"Three Mutual Resemblances"* refer to the mutual resonance of yin-yang transformations in the *Great Changes*, the *Yellow and Lao*, and the *Furnace Fire*. As stated: *"The three Ways emerge from one, all following the same path,"* and *"Three threads arrayed, branches and stems intertwined, sharing one origin under different names, all issuing from a single gate."* Additionally, there is a *Eulogy Preface*, sometimes called the *Postscript* or attributed to Wei Gong’s eulogy of later scholars, though its origin remains uncertain; thus, it is collectively termed the *Eulogy Preface*. Zhu Xi of the Huian School meticulously analyzed its content and concluded it was a commentary’s *Postscript*, now lost, leaving only the preface. Modern annotators have all followed Zhu Xi’s interpretation, omitting it from their editions. However, since older editions include it, it cannot be discarded. I have thus appended it to the end of this volume, unwilling to abandon the old.

Alas! From Wei Gong’s time to the present spans over a thousand years. As antiquity recedes, transmission errors multiply. When a discerning scholar laments the long-obscured ancient text and endeavors to excise falsehoods and clarify truth, the multitude inevitably gapes in astonishment, denouncing and mocking their presumption. Thus, they choose silence, never daring to take up the brush and assume responsibility for this work. Yet, what of future generations? This is why Zheng Xuyi so deeply cherished this book.

This humble latecomer to learning was fortunate to encounter an enlightened teacher and receive the authentic transmission of this Dao. Having also obtained a fine edition of this text, I tested its principles in practice and lectured upon them until I gained rough mastery. After a full year, the book was completed. Yet, fearing my explanations might remain incomplete or my words insufficiently detailed, I revised it three or four times. Still concerned that later generations would have no means to reconcile discrepancies, I collated the Shu edition, Yue edition, Ji edition, and various versions from Qiantang, cross-referencing them to establish a definitive text.

As for the remaining inconsistencies and irregularities, Zhu Xi’s *Textual Investigations* already addresses them, so I shall not belabor the point here.

Written on the day when the Five Planets conjoined in Chou and the golden essence filled the crucible, by Quanyinzi, the Purple Court Recluse of Linwu Grotto-Heaven.

*Preface to the* Clarifying Doubts on the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*
*(Omitted from the Siku edition. The preface has been collated primarily against the* Daoist Canon Essentials *edition. Note: "Drumming and forging" in the* Daoist Canon Essentials *appears as "drumming and striking." The character "in the preface" was originally missing and has been restored from the* Daoist Canon Essentials *edition.)*

*Clarifying Doubts on the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi
*By Yuyan, the Hermit of Linwu Mountain, Quanyinzi*

**Clarifying Doubts on the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*: First Chapter**

The term *kuangguo* 匡郭—one edition writes 匡 as 垣, while Chen Baoyi’s annotated version emends it to 围郭 to avoid taboo—refers to the alignment of the wheel-hub and axle in the cultivation of the Elixir: just as the axle must be centered within the hub, so too must the heart be rectified in practice. The axle lies within the hub, piercing through it, while the spokes lie outside, converging upon it. One edition mistakenly writes 轴 as 辐.

The "four trigrams of the Female and Male" summarize the preceding lines on Qian and Kun as the gate and door, Kan and Li as the enclosing frame. These four trigrams represent the crucible and the medicinal ingredients, while the sixty trigrams that follow denote the firing times. As the middle chapter states, "The four are a primordial chaos," which likewise refers back to the lines on Qian’s firmness, Kun’s yielding, Kan and Li as the foremost. Later, it speaks of the "application of the sixty trigrams," spreading them out like a chariot, thus completing the sixty-four trigrams. All sixty-four trigrams serve the purpose of our Dao of the Elixir—this is why the text is called the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. One edition mistakenly takes the "four trigrams of the Female and Male" as Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen, which is incorrect.

The phrase "like the key to a lock" is rendered as "mutual" in Ningshenzi Chen Huizhen’s annotated edition. It means that, just as a charioteer holds the reins and bit, adhering to the guiding rope, the compass, and the carpenter’s square, following the wheel tracks while remaining centered to control what lies outside, so too does the practitioner, seated within the chariot, govern the horse’s advance and retreat, aligning with the rules and measures. This echoes the middle chapter’s "the dragon and horse are harnessed," where the enlightened ruler masters the times. An older edition mistakenly writes "like the charioteer holding the reins and bit, with the guiding rope" as "like the craftsman holding the reins and bit, with the guiding rope and carpenter’s square." This error was perpetuated by earlier commentators, who took it to mean "like the craftsman’s use of the guiding rope, compass, and square, or the charioteer’s use of the reins, bit, and wheel tracks," which is incorrect.

"Combining to make sixty" refers to the daily use of two trigrams, which over thirty days of a month combine to form sixty trigrams. One edition mistakenly writes "combining to make sixty-four." "Proceeding in sequence" is rendered as "proceeding as" in one edition.

From *Ji* and *Wei* to *mei*-dawn refers to the passage below on "from the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon." One edition mistakenly writes *mei* as *hui*. Here, *Ji* and *Wei* denote the dark of the moon, while *mei*-dawn signifies the new moon. To interpret it as "from *Ji* and *Wei* to the dawn of the dark moon" would be to say "from the dark of the moon to the dawn of the dark moon," which grossly distorts the meaning.

"Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; autumn and winter apply to external use, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*." This refers to the pairing of two trigrams: the first, belonging to spring and summer, spans from *zi* to *si*, as yang ascends from below; the second, belonging to autumn and winter, spans from *wu* to *hai*, as yin descends from above. If taken as a single trigram, it would have only six lines, and when matched with the twelve hours, exactly half would be missing. Thus, the daily practice of two trigrams must be understood as referring to both together.

"Attaining its sequence"—one edition writes 序 as 理. "Transformation occurs within"—Zhu Xi’s annotated edition writes 变化 as 升降. One edition writes "ascending and descending, transforming within it."

"Enveloping" alludes to a passage in *Wenzi*’s *Tongxuan Zhenjing*. An older edition mistakenly writes 包裹 as 包囊.

"Using the formless to shape the formed" refers to the *zhi* of creation, not the *zhi* of control. The Great Elixir’s method creates something from nothing, hence "using the formless to shape the formed." Some interpret this as the *zhi* of control, taking "formless" as spirit, mercury, or Li, and "formed" as qi, lead, or Kan. While this is one possible reading, it is not Master Wei’s original intent.

I have repeatedly examined this matter and found that later scholars, misled by the *Longhu Jing*’s line "the formless and the formed mutually control each other, the Vermilion Bird flames in the void," failed to consider the broader context and mistakenly applied the *zhi* of creation to the *zhi* of control. Similarly, the middle chapter states: "The firm and the yielding are distinct, not intermingling," meaning they do not encroach upon one another. It continues: "The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting." This differs from the later chapter’s meaning of the firm and yielding being separate.

Some, clinging to the *Longhu Jing*’s line "the firm and yielding contend, not intermingling, which is not the fault of fire, but the blame lies with earth," have also misapplied this to the meaning of the firm and yielding being separate. Modern scholars commonly claim that Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi* based on the *Longhu Jing*, and thus must defer to its interpretations. Yet they do not realize that the *Longhu Jing* merely paraphrases the *Cantong Qi* and was actually written after Master Wei’s work.

Zhu Xi of Huian remarked: "Later scholars, seeing that Wei Boyang’s transmission mentions the *Longhu Shangjing*, fabricated this text, largely modeling it after the *Cantong Qi* but introducing errors." I once hesitated to accept Zhu Xi’s view, but upon repeated reflection and cross-examination with the *Cantong Qi*, I came to see the *Longhu Jing*’s inconsistencies and realized it truly is a paraphrase of the *Cantong Qi*.

Master Wei’s *Cantong Qi* borrows the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* to elucidate the secrets of Elixir-making, not to expand upon the *Longhu Jing*. Had he intended to expand upon the *Longhu Jing*, the text would have been called the *Longhu Cantong Qi*, not the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. Nevertheless, the *Longhu Jing* remains a fine work, which is why Cai Jitong admired its lines, such as: "The Primordial Lord first refines mercury, the divine chamber containing the cavernous void."

Moreover, it states: "The essential principle of the natural is first to preserve, then to let perish." This is indeed a profound insight, though it is not a text from before Master Wei’s time. Where it reads "the vessels and implements are empty," the Li Baosu annotated edition has "all." As evidence, one version has "evidence" (征) written as "proof" (证), which is acceptable, while another has "should" (当) instead of "correspond" (相当), which is incorrect. Where it reads "from beginning to end," one version has "from end to beginning" (终始), which is also incorrect. Where it reads "all receive from the Central Palace," one version has "in" (在) instead of "receive" (禀), and another has "the Central Palace receives" (中宫所禀), both of which are incorrect. Where it reads "at this time" (之时), one version has "at this juncture" (际). Where it reads "governing the Yellow and transforming," one version has "transforming the Yellow and enveloping" (化黄包).

For "鄞鄂," Zhu Xi’s *Textual Variants* renders it as "根鄂," where "鄂" means "calyx." As the *Book of Songs* says: "The calyx does not..."—this is the same "鄂" character. Some versions write it as "垠堮," "圻堮," or "釿锷," all of which are incorrect. Where it reads "entitled the Primordial Sovereign" (称元皇), one version has "should be entitled" (当). Where it reads "the first year" (元年), one version has "the first qi" (元炁). Where it reads "then the sprout flourishes" (乃芽滋), one version has "then the sprout arises" (芽乃生), and another has "then the bud flourishes" (乃牙滋).

Regarding the line "The *Fu* hexagram establishes the initial," some suspected it repeated the "establishes the initial" in the *Guan Ju* and thus changed "initial" (初) to "sprout" (萌). Zhu Xi noted that this was a reckless alteration by those ignorant of ancient rhyme. Similarly, in the line "the nine and six also correspond" (九六亦相当), some suspected it repeated "hard and soft correspond" (刚柔相当) and changed "correspond" (当) to "respond" (应), which is also incorrect.

The line "sun and moon have no dual brightness" means that when the sun rises, the moon sets, and when the moon rises, the sun sets, alternating their illumination day and night. One version replaces "no" (无) with "qi" (炁), which is incorrect. In ancient times, "无" was used for "no," as in the *Yi*’s "no delusion" (无妄) and "no blame" (无咎). Another version has "brilliant and forming a pair" (焕炳而成双).

Where it reads "the rabbit spits forth its light," one version has "the rabbit’s essence spits forth radiant light" (兔魄吐精光), and another has "the rabbit’s essence spits forth its light" (兔魄吐生光). Where it reads "the East loses its brightness" (东方丧其明), an old version has "the Northeast loses its brightness" (东北丧其明), likely following the *Yi*’s phrase "the Northeast loses its companion" (东北丧朋) and perpetuating the error through habit. However, the *Kun* hexagram states: "In the Southwest, it gains companions; in the Northeast, it loses companions." This refers to the *Kun* position in the Southwest, where *Dui* (West), *Li* (South), and *Xun* (Southeast) are all yin hexagrams; yin following yin is called "gaining companions." In the Northeast, *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Qian* are all yang hexagrams, hence "losing companions." Yet Master Wei’s line, "On the thirtieth day of *Kun*-yi, the East loses its brightness," refers to the morning of the thirtieth day when the Great Yin sets in the eastern *yi* position—it does not employ the *Kun* hexagram’s "Northeast loses companions." How is this clarified?

The Western regions *geng* and *xin*, the Southern regions *bing* and *ding*, and the Eastern regions *jia* and *yi* are the six nodes within a month where the Great Yin appears at dusk and sets at dawn—what Wang Baoyi called the "three shifts of the moon." On the third day, the moon appears at dusk in the West at *geng* and sets at dawn on the sixteenth in the West at *xin*; on the eighth day, it appears at dusk in the South at *ding* and sets at dawn on the twenty-third in the South at *bing*; on the fifteenth day, it appears at dusk in the East at *jia* and sets at dawn on the thirtieth in the East at *yi*. The principle is thus clear. How could *yi* be the Northeast? Since ancient times, *jia* and *yi* have both been placed in the East, not the Northeast. If *yi* were the Northeast, then when the *Qian* trigram aligns with it, why not call it "abundant and full in *jia* Northeast"? *Jia*, being closer to the Northeast, is not called the Northeast, so how much less could *yi*, which precedes *jia* and is closer to the Southeast, be the Northeast? Its non-Northeastern position is evident.

The line "the nine and six also correspond" was explained earlier under the *Fu* hexagram’s "establishes the initial." The phrase "the images of the *Yi* perish and conceal" refers to the night of the thirtieth day, when the images of the sun and moon both sink in the North. One version has "yang qi" (阳炁) instead of "images of the *Yi*" (《易》象), which is incorrect. The line "like the midwinter node, it illuminates the blind after birth" was misplaced in the *Postscript* in the old edition. Chen Baoyi moved it to before "turning right," but both arrangements are incorrect. This passage rhymes with two "injured" (伤) characters and, when connected to the earlier "the images of the *Yi* perish and conceal," also rhymes with two "conceal" (藏) characters. Ancient writers often used repeated rhymes, but later scholars, not understanding this, recklessly altered the text, disrupting its coherence. Examples include the repeated "establishes the initial" in the *Guan Ju* and the *Fu* hexagram, and the repeated "correspond" in "hard and soft correspond" and "the nine and six also correspond." How could one hastily alter the correct text due to repeated rhymes?

Where it reads "merchants and travelers" (商旅), one version has "merchants" (贾). Where it reads "vast and expansive" (浩广), one version has "vast and boundless" (浩旷). Where it reads "subtle and hard to perceive" (眇难睹), one version has "hard to behold" (难觌). Where it reads "signs and evidence" (符征), one version has "signs and proof" (符证). Where it reads "seasonal ordinances" (节令), one version has "timely ordinances" (时令). Where it reads "examined within the human heart" (中稽於人心), one version has "examined within human emotions" (中稽於人情). Where it reads "following the hexagram’s changes" (依卦变), one version has "following the hexagram’s nodes" (循卦节). Where it reads "following the *Xiang* commentary" (循《象》辞), one version has "relying on the *Tuan*" (因《彖》) instead of "following the *Xiang*," which is incorrect.

The lines "When *Qian* and *Kun* are employed, Heaven and Earth are then ordered" seem to quote the *Qian* hexagram’s "When the yang of *Qian* is employed, the world is ordered," but given the earlier line "Kan and Li are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*," this refers to Kan and Li as the functions of *Qian* and *Kun*, not the "employing nine" or "employing six." Just as the earlier "the East loses its brightness" does not use the *Kun* hexagram’s "Northeast loses companions," Master Wei’s composition of this text largely employs borrowing and need not be rigidly adhered to.

The line "Can one not be cautious?" (可不慎乎) has one version that reads "Can one fail to be cautious?" (可得不慎乎), which is incorrect. Where it reads "the Dipper’s handle" (魁杓), one version has "handle" (柄) instead of "ladle" (杓). "誃离" means "separation," with one version writing it as "移离" and another as "坎离."

Here follows the translation:

---

Some versions render "仰俯" as "俯仰." Master Zhu stated that it should read "仰俯," as this follows the *xu* rhyme, and we adopt this reading. In one version, "統錄" appears as "總錄." Where it reads "日含五行精," one version has "合" instead of "含," which is incorrect. "诘过贻主" appears in one version as "结过移主." For "辰极处正," one version has "受" instead of "处," and another has "政" instead of "正." "布政" appears in one version as "政德." "终修" is rendered in one version as "终循" and in another as "中美." Where it reads "以掩蔽," one version has "已" instead of "以."

"有无亦相须" refers to the mutual dependence of water and fire, the two *qi*, in completing the transformations of creation. Some versions render "有无" as "金炁" or "吟炁," both of which are incorrect. "进退分布" appears in one version as "退而分布," which is incorrect. "采之类白" is rendered in one version as "望之类白" and in another as "摇之类白." "白裹" appears in one version as "包裹." "相扶" is rendered in one version as "相拘." "相连" appears in one version as "相通."

"This is not the method of storing within the five viscera" (是非歷藏法) means that this Dao is not the method of visualizing and storing within the five viscera. If one takes the words "是非" to mean "right and wrong," one has misunderstood. "次日辰" appears in one version as "以日辰," which is incorrect. "累土" appears in one version as "周回." "而意悦" is rendered in one version as "意悦喜."

"Straddling fire, one is not scorched; entering water, one is not drenched." This describes the dharma-body after the Dao is accomplished. If one were to cast the fleshly body into water or fire, how could one escape being scorched or drenched? "移居" appears in one version as "移名," which is incorrect. "功滿" appears in one version as "功成," which is incorrect.

"偃月" (reclining moon): given that the text below reads "汞日" (mercury-sun), "偃" is likely a corruption of "鉛" (lead), a transmission error of sound. Where it reads "作鼎爐," an older version has "作法," which is incorrect. "艮亦八" appears in one version as "亦如之." "亏明" appears in one version as "亏伤."

"Gold’s essence derives from the sun’s radiance; at dawn of the new moon, it receives the solar tally." This means that the moon’s light is born from the sun, and at the dawn of each new moon, it conjoins with the sun. For gold and fire are none other than the sun and moon. An older version has "月" instead of "日," which is incorrect. If one were to think that gold’s essence derives from the moon, it would be as if the sun and moon themselves derived from the moon—what principle could justify this?

"數稱五" appears in one version as "號稱五." "含育" appears in one version as "貪欲." "伫息" refers to the conjoining of concentrated stillness and the breath, the two merging as one, like the union of husband and wife. One version has "思" instead of "息," and another has "恩," both of which are incorrect. "執平" appears in one version as "氣平."

"Earth wanders through the four seasons, guarding its boundaries and fixing its rules." In all versions, this line appears below "longevity is attained," but in Zheng Xu’s version, it appears below "fundamental nature shares a common origin." "Gold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury." This directly points to the transformations of ordinary cinnabar and ordinary mercury, using them as metaphors for the transformations in the elixir method. It is not a matter of borrowing one external thing to compare with one internal thing, nor of setting them in opposition.

"以黍" appears in one version as "以粟," which is incorrect. "其卵" appears in one version as "其子," which is incorrect. "泥汞" appears in one version as "泥澒." "炼飞" appears in one version as "炼治" and in another as "炼持." "鼓铸" appears in one version as "鼓下," which is incorrect. "杂性不同类" appears in one version as "杂性不同种."

"Those who rely on luck never meet success; only the sage knows this." These ten characters are absent in Master Zhu’s version. "生狐疑" appears in one version as "坐狐疑." "始畫八卦，效法天地" appears in one version as "始畫八卦象，效法天地圖" and in another as "畫八卦，效天圖," both of which are incorrect. "循而."

One version reads "structural formation" instead of "one version."

"庶圣" refers to the sage without rank—Confucius is such a one. One version reads "the sage and," which is incorrect.

"三君" appears in one version as "three sages." "令可法" appears in one version as "诚可法."

"为世定此书" means that the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is formless and traceless, leaving nothing for later generations to emulate. Thus, this *Cantong qi* was established for the world. This aligns in meaning with the middle section’s "定录斯文."

An old version reads "为世定诗书," which is incorrect. "窃为" appears in one version as "窃待." "辄思虑" appears in one version as "缀斯愚," which is incorrect.

"金计有十五，水数亦如之" refers to the earlier chapter’s "上弦兑数八，下弦艮亦八." For the upper quarter, metal weighs half a catty; for the lower quarter, water weighs half a catty. When the two quarters are combined, they form the number of days in a month—thirty—though this differs from the meaning of "metal within water."

One version reads "金数十有五" instead of "金计有十五."

"其土遂不入，二者与之俱，三物相含受，变化状若神." These three things are metal, water, and earth. When metal and water combine with earth, they become one, hence "three things mutually containing and receiving." If fire were added, it would become five things.

Some interpret the three things as metal, fire, and wood, and the two things as water and fire, but this is overly convoluted and not the profound teaching. One version reads "其三" instead of "其土"; another reads "火二" or "水二" instead of "二者," both of which are incorrect.

"捣治" appears in one version as "铸冶." "致坚完" appears in one version as "致坚完" (with "致" unchanged).

"炎火张於下，龙虎声正勤" shares the same meaning as the later passage: "升熬於甑山兮，炎火张设下；白虎倡导前兮，苍龙和於后." An old version reads "昼夜" instead of "龙虎," which is incorrect.

"始文使可修" appears in one version as "始初文可修." "亲观" appears in one version as "相亲" and another as "须亲."

"服之" appears in one version as "粉提," another as "粉捏," and another as "提粉," all of which are incorrect. "一丸" appears in one version as "一元" and another as "一粒," both incorrect.

"刀圭" refers merely to the tip of a knife’s edge, indicating its small quantity. While one might cleverly interpret "刀" as metal and "圭" as two earths, this is not Master Wei’s original intent.

"较约" appears in one version as "简约." "光明" appears in one version as "光荣," which is incorrect. "薄蚀" appears in one version as "激薄." "显龙虎" appears in one version as "题龙虎." "嘉黄芽" appears in one version as "加黄芽."

**Middle Section: Resolving Doubts**

"偕以造化" appears in one version as "须以造化" and another as "始以造化." "元基" appears in one version as "玄基" and another as "元模."

"六十卦用，张布为舆" appears in one version as "六十卦周," which is incorrect. "不邪" appears in one version as "不陂." "倾危国家" appears in one version as "家国倾危."

"卦日" appears in one version as "卦月." "六十卦用，各自有日" appears in one version as "余六十卦," which is incorrect.

"在义设刑" appears in an old version as "立义设刑." "日辰" appears in one version as "日夜." "用心" appears in one version as "逆贼" and another as "迸散."

"己口" appears in one version as "鼎口." "之来" appears in one version as "之中." "刚柔断矣，不相涉入" was previously explained in the upper section under "以无制有."

"晦朔之问，合符行中，至始於东北箕、斗之乡." The interval between the last day of the lunar month and the first is the time after *hai* and before *zi*, when the sun and moon conceal themselves. The region of *Ji* and *Dou* lies after *gen* and before *yin*, where the sun and moon begin their revolution. This metaphorically illustrates the subtlety of the elixir method, which follows the same path as heaven, earth, the sun, and the moon.

Some directly take the time after *gen* and before *yin* as the interval between the last and first days of the lunar month, considering it the moment when the first yang arises and the medicine is gathered. This interpretation is far off the mark.

"旋而右转，呕轮吐萌" describes the yang fire rotating from the waist, passing through *Dou* and *Ji*, and ascending to the *Xuan Guan*, where its radiance shines beyond the curtains. One version reads "左旋" instead of "旋而右转."

"昴毕之上，震出为征" refers to the moon’s initial appearance in the west, resembling the trigram *Zhen*, symbolizing the fire timing within the body. If one interprets the moon’s rising position according to the *Xiantian* eight trigrams, *Zhen* in the *Xiantian* arrangement is not in the west, nor is the fire timing’s *Zhen* in the west. Failing to grasp its true meaning, one merely sees contradictions in the text.

"和平" appears in one version as "初和."

Its governing principle—one version reads "yin" instead of "its."

"Six-five *Kun* bearing" refers to the thirty days of the sixth lunar month, not the sixth line of the *Kun* hexagram. The yang numbers have reached their end, and upon completion, they begin anew. Following nature and aligning with essence, they turn and interact.

All versions place this under "the compass and square of the Dao," except for Master Zhu’s edition, which places it under "the world as a category of the mother," which is incorrect.

"Circulating through the six lines"—one version reads "chapter" instead of "circulate," which is incorrect.

"Difficult to"—one version reads "can" instead of "difficult to."

"Flourishing and manifest"—one version reads "prosperous" instead of "manifest."

"Generating radiance"—one version reads "correct" instead of "generating," which is incorrect.

"Gradually advancing"—one version reads "reposing" instead of "gradually."

"Completing *Tai*"—one version reads "bearing" instead of "completing."

"Moving and"—one version reads "shifting" instead of "and."

"*Yu* pods"—one version reads "leaves" instead of "pods," which is incorrect.

"Shaking and searching"—one version reads "capital" instead of "searching."

"The yang ends at *Si*, centered and interacting." This refers to the fourth month, which corresponds to *Si*, with the pitch matching *Zhong Lü*. Master Xiashan Zi Zhan Gu’s annotated edition reads "Zhong Lü" instead of "centered," while one version reads "noon" instead of "centered," which is incorrect. Noon corresponds to *Ruibin*.

"Is"—one version reads "presides" instead of "is."

"Wandering the world and departing from position"—one version reads "retreating from worldly position," which is incorrect.

"Its essence"—one version reads "true" instead of "its."

"The yin extends while the yang withdraws, damaging names and reputations." This refers to the seventh month, which corresponds to *Shen*, with the pitch matching *Yize*. "Extends" means *Shen*, and "damages" means *Yi*. An older edition reads "the yang perishes," while another reads "the yang vanishes," both of which are incorrect.

"Diminishing and vanishing"—one version reads "ceasing" instead of "vanishing," which is incorrect.

"Utmost spirit"—one version reads "its" instead of "utmost," and another reads "*Kun*" instead of "spirit."

"Decline and flourishing"—one version reads "alternating" instead of "decline," which is incorrect.

"Bearing and receiving"—one version reads "mercury" instead of "bearing."

"A thousand autumns"—one version reads "years" instead of "autumns."

"One absence"—one version reads "primordial" instead of "absence," which is incorrect.

"Flowing and spreading"—one version reads "clouds" instead of "flowing."

"Resembling a chicken’s egg, its flesh smooth as maltose." An older edition misplaced this passage, likely doubting its repetitive rhyme and arbitrarily relocating it. It has now been corrected.

"Resembling"—one version reads "form" instead of "resembling."

"Mutually supporting"—one version reads "corresponding" instead of "supporting."

"Thus complete"—one version reads "together" instead of "complete."

"Smooth as maltose"—an older edition reads "lead" instead of "maltose," which Master Zhu corrected to "maltose."

"Newly forged blade"—this was explained in the previous section.

"Constantly as"—one version reads "firmly constructed," another "completely built," and another "walled."

"At this time, essence aligns with *Qian* and *Kun*." One version reads: "At the beginning, originating from *Qian* and *Kun*."

"Restraining leads to water settling, water as the first of the Five Phases." One version reads: "leads to water settling fire, the beginning of the Five Phases."

"The Dao has no form or image"—an older edition reads "of" instead of "no," for in ancient script, the character for "absence" was written similarly to "of," and in cursive, they resemble each other, leading to the error.

"Image"—one version reads "form."

"The true One is difficult to depict"—one version reads "its" instead of "One."

"Utmost mystery"—one version reads "profound and," which is incorrect.

"The three treasures of ears, eyes, and mouth"—one version reads "the treasures of ears, eyes, and self," which is incorrect.

"Manifesting and spreading"—one version reads "pervading" instead of "spreading."

"Observing and surveying"—one version reads "listening" instead of "surveying."

"Overturning the primordial chaos"—one version reads "following the primordial."

"Thought after thought"—an older edition reads "thoughtless."

"Verification shifts naturally"—an older edition reads "verification is difficult to shift," which is incorrect.

"Gradually and"—one version reads "with gradual."

"Penetrating the boundless"—one version reads "moistening" instead of "penetrating," which is incorrect.

"Within the valley"—one version reads "central palace," another "guest within," both incorrect.

"Leaning on a staff"—one version reads "holding a staff."

"Submerging in water"—one version reads "casting into" instead of "submerging."

"Harvesting millet"—one version reads "obtaining" instead of "harvesting."

"No visible achievement"—one version reads "no" instead of "not."

"Utmost simplicity"—one version reads "affairs" instead of "utmost," which is incorrect, likely due to the similarity between the cursive forms of "utmost" and "affairs."

"Thus they interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another." An older edition, including Peng Zhenyi’s annotation and Liu Yongnian’s *Shaoxing Inquiry* version, placed this under "the compassionate mother nurtures, the filial child repays." Master Zhu noted: "Now examining these two lines, they properly belong under 'all greedily contend,' where four lines follow in sequence, their meaning connected. They should not be here." This chapter uses the analogy of mother and child, where "thus they interlock and swallow" reflects the meaning of the compassionate crow feeding its parent, and thus belongs here. It has now been restored according to the older edition.

"Three and five become one"—this refers to the earlier section where the *Zi* and *Wu* numbers combine as three, and the *Wu* and *Ji* numbers are called five, differing from the *Wuzhen Pian*’s "three-five-one."

"Become"—one version reads "and," which is incorrect.

"*Zi* turns to the right"—this means the tiger is born within water.

"*Wu* rotates to the east"—this means the dragon emerges from within fire.

"*Zi* and *Wu*"—these are water and fire.

"*Zi* turns to the right"—where metal and water unite, turning right toward *Zi*.

"*Wu* rotates to the east"—where wood and fire are companions, rotating east toward *Wu*.

The Dao of heaven turns left while revolving right; the Dao of returning elixir is identical to the heavenly Dao. If one says: "*Zi* turns right and advances to *You*, *Wu* rotates east and advances to *Mao*," this would be a rightward rotation and leftward turn, contrary to the heavenly Dao.

"Rotates to the east"—one version reads "left" instead of "east."

"Host and guest"—one version reads "settled" instead of "guest."

"Greedily contending"—one version reads "convenient" instead of "contending," another "flourishing," both incorrect.

"Each attains its nature"—one version reads "has" instead of "attains," and "achievement" instead of "nature."

"As if examining"—one version reads "having" instead of "examining."

"Attaining the correct Dao"—one version reads "attaining as the accomplished Dao."

"The father presides over bestowing"—one version reads "generates" instead of "presides," which is incorrect.

"The female phoenix"—one version reads "fat" instead of "female."

"The Dao of transformation"—one version reads "achievement" instead of "Dao," another "essence," both incorrect.

"At the inception of receiving *qi*"—one version reads "primordial" instead of "of."

"Daily transformation, monthly change"—this adopts Zhuangzi’s phrasing. One version reads "daily reception, monthly change," which is incorrect.

Moreover, doubting that "daily reception, monthly change" obstructs coherence, one version alters it to "monthly reception, daily change"—this, too, is incorrect.

"The nature of water flows freely"—one version reads "harmonious and fused" instead of "flows freely."

"Wood and fire as companions"—this refers to the dragon emerging from within fire, where the east (three) and south (two) together form five.

"Where metal and water converge"—this refers to the tiger being born toward water, where the north (one) and west (four) jointly complete it.

Zhang Ziyang states: "The Four Symbols do not depart from the Two Bodies." This precisely captures the meaning.

Some employ the precelestial *Li* and *Kan* to supplement the postcelestial *Zhen* and *Dui* in expounding this idea, yet this not only strays from Master Wei’s original intent but also inverts the great process of inner transformation.

One version reads "metal and wood" instead of "metal and water," and "water and fire" instead of "wood and fire"—a grave error indeed.

"Arranged as"—one version reads "joined" instead of "arranged," another "drawn."

"Heart red as the female"—one version omits these four characters.

"The five phases begin with *zi*"—one version omits these four characters, another substitutes "*ju*" for "*zi*."

"Establishing the weft"—one version reads "position" instead of "weft."

"*Xu* and *Wei*"—one version reads "embracing the true."

"Grasping fire"—one version reads "descending to sit."

"Harmonizing and blending"—one version reads "grasping fire."

"Indulging vain hopes"—one version reads "hoping for some expectation."

"With □"—one version reads "□" as "□."

**Clarifying Doubts in the Lower Chapter**

Only the sages and worthies of old, embracing the mysterious and holding fast to the true, deeply pitied later generations—those who love the Dao—who, following peripheral trends, traced and illustrated ancient texts, compiling them into diagrams and books to enlighten posterity. Yet they revealed only branches and leaves, concealing the root and trunk.

This means that the ancient sages, having attained this Dao and embraced the mysterious while holding fast to the true, further pitied later generations of Dao-seekers who failed to grasp its teachings. Thus, they followed peripheral trends, citing antiquity to validate the present, compiling diagrams and books to instruct them. Yet they dared not expose it too directly, so they resorted to designations like "five metals" and "eight stones" to elucidate it.

The phrase "compiling diagrams and books, designating them as various stones" refers to the ancient sages’ method, not to later generations of Dao-seekers. In this chapter, Peng Zhenyi and Chen Baoyi both misunderstood the meaning, while only Master Zhu’s commentary grasped its essence.

"The Three Origins"—one version reads "light" instead of "origin," which is incorrect.

"Essence overflows"—one version reads "fluids" instead of "essence," which is incorrect.
"Transforming form"—one version reads "transform" as "change."
"Reversing and distorting the texts" means repeatedly altering and confusing the words so as not to reveal them too directly.
One version reads "distort" as "conceal," which is incorrect.
"Transmitted through the ages"—one version reads "transmit" as "raise."
"Not serving in office"—one version reads "serving" as "thus."
"Thus creating chaotic words"—one version reads "creating" as "not," which is incorrect.
"The Mysterious Channel"—one version reads "channel" as "distant."
"Retreating from behind"—an old version reads "behind" as "alter," which is incorrect.

"When the Pass Spear rises and falls,
The celestial cycle hastens its course."

The two characters "celestial cycle" in old versions were written as "celestial qi." Master Zhu suspected that "celestial qi" lacked coherent meaning and thus emended it to "harmful qi," which is also incorrect. The character "harm" resembles "cycle," and "qi" is quite similar to "heaven."

"The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers never run dry,
Their waters flow ceaselessly into the sea."

An old version reads "into" as "none," which is incorrect. The error of "none" for "into" has already been explained in detail under the middle section’s "The Dao has no form or image."
One version reads "Yellow River" as "Huai River."
"Ending and returning to the beginning"—one version reads "returning to end and begin," another reads "returning to renew the beginning."
"Spread out"—one version reads "out" as "set up."
"White Tiger"—one version reads "Tiger" as "alum," which is incorrect.
"Azure Dragon"—one version reads "Dragon" as "fluid," which is incorrect.
"Pressing to halt"—one version reads "halt" as "proceed."
"Dragon’s scales, armor, and mane"—one version reads "Dragon" as "fish" and "armor" as "familiar," which is incorrect.
"Interconnected"—one version reads "interconnected" as "jumbled."
"Guarding one another"—one version reads "one another" as "and."
"House Six"—one version reads "Six" as "Seven," which is incorrect.
"True Yang"—one version reads "Yang" as "Yin," which is incorrect.

"When Three and Five converge with One,
All gather and return to one place."

This refers to the qi of House Six, Pleiades Seven, and Spread Two combining with the North’s Danger One, all converging and returning to a single locus. Within this lies profound transformation: Spread (south) and Danger (north) represent the moon, while House (east) and Pleiades (west) represent the sun. Danger One combined with House Six forms the generative and completive numbers of water. Spread Two combined with Pleiades Seven forms the generative and completive numbers of fire. House Six in the east and Spread Two in the south—wood and fire as companions—combine Six and Two to make Eight. Pleiades Seven in the west and Danger One in the north—metal and water in union—combine Seven and One to make Eight, corresponding to the weight of two eights (one catty). This is what is meant by "originating from but two things."

One version reads "converge with One" as "converge as One," another as "converge with it and One," both of which are incorrect. Another version reads "one place" as "two places," which is also incorrect. One must recognize that when Master Wei composed this work, no phrase failed to align with the transformations of creation. If it were instead: "When Three and Five converge with One, all gather and return to two places," what transformation would remain? Moreover, the notion of "two places" is particularly egregious. Even if it truly referred to two places, it should say "divide," not "gather." Since it speaks of "gathering," it should say "one place," not "two places."

"Taking the beginning"—Zhan Xiashan’s annotation reads "beginning takes."
"Red permeates both surface and interior"—one version reads "red and black penetrate surface and interior."
"Millet grain"—one version reads "millet" as "rice," which is incorrect.
"As mountain and marsh qi awaits"—one version reads "mountain and marsh qi steams together," which is incorrect.
"For ten thousand generations"—one version reads "generations" as "eras."
"And can be examined"—one version reads "and" as "from."
"Heart and spirit"—one version reads "heart" as "soul."
"Suddenly self-awakened"—one version reads "suddenly" as "abruptly."
"Receiving the illustrated records"—one version reads "receiving the records of heaven," which is incorrect.

**Clarifying Doubts in the "Tripod Vessel Song"**

"Diameter: one fen"—an old version reads "diameter" as "ten."
"Length: one foot two inches"—one version reads "one foot two inches" as "two feet," which is incorrect.
"Belly aligned with the navel"—Master Zhu notes: "Aligned" here is the ancient form of "navel."
One version reads "belly three navels," which is incorrect.
"Head and tail martial, center civil"—this refers to the dark and new moons as head and tail, and the full moon as the center. Head and tail are thus one locus, and the center is also one locus. If one claims that *si* (the sixth Earthly Branch) is the yang *zi* (first Earthly Branch) tail, *wu* (seventh Earthly Branch) is the yin *hai* (twelfth Earthly Branch) head, and *si* and *wu* in both directions form the center, then there would be two heads, two tails, and two centers.

Another interpretation: when advancing yang fire, *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* (first, second, and third Earthly Branches) are the head, *chen* and *si* (fifth and sixth) are the tail; when retreating yin tally, *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* (seventh, eighth, and ninth) are the head, *xu* and *hai* (eleventh and twelfth) are the tail; the central palace is the center—thus two heads, two tails, and one center. Neither interpretation is stable.

"Two Sevens gather"—one version reads "gather" as "orifices," which is incorrect.
"Gazing at the brain’s texture"—one version reads "gazing" as "looking up," another as "gallbladder," both of which are incorrect.

The "three correlations" refer to the mutual resemblance of the transformations of yin and yang in the *Great Ease* (*Yi*), the Yellow and the Old (Huang-Lao), and furnace alchemy. Ever since Peng Zhenyi depicted the five phases with wood as three, fire as two, earth as five, metal as four, and water as one—forming a diagram of five positions in mutual resonance—later generations have all followed Peng’s interpretation, mistakenly believing it to be Master Wei’s original text and conflating it with the theory of the five phases’ correlations. This error has persisted to this day without challenge, for none have considered what Master Wei truly meant by "correlation." Moreover, the *Yi*’s phrase "five positions in mutual resonance" refers to the generative and completive numbers of the five phases. Peng’s system uses only the generative numbers—how can this be called "five positions in mutual resonance"? Some argue that wood (three) and fire (two) form one five, metal (four) and water (one) form another five, with central earth (five) completing the three fives, which might still be termed "three fives in correlation." Yet to speak of the five phases’ correlation in this way is untenable: water has its own number (one), fire its own (two), while metal, wood, and earth each differ—where is the correlation? One version reads "mutually resembling," which is somewhat plausible, though still not as clear as "three correlations." Examining the subsequent text, we find: "The three Ways emerge from one, all following the same path," and again: "Arrayed as three strands, their branches and stems intertwine. Though named differently, they issue from a single gate." Here, the meaning of "three correlations" is unmistakably evident.

The "crude man of Kuai" is Master Wei’s self-reference. Though Wei was from Shangyu in Kuaiji, he did not call himself "Kuaiji" but "Kuai" to avoid revealing his native place. Had he written "Kuaiji" directly, it would have been a later alteration, not his original wording. "Clinging to plainness and simplicity"—one version reads "embracing simplicity and plainness." "Disdaining power and glory" means he refused to covet authority or honor. The character *le* ("joy") should be read in the departing tone. One version mistakenly writes *huan* ("delight") for *quan* ("power"). "Profit and fame"—one version writes *ling* ("command") for *li* ("profit"). "Living in tranquil seclusion"—one version reads "a distant traveler in quiet repose." "Observing his inclinations"—one version writes *zhi* ("purpose") for *suo* ("that which"). "Common discourse"—one version writes *lun* ("discourse") for *lun* ("ethics"). "Disseminating transformation"—one version writes *shen* ("spirit") for *shi* ("to enact"). "Returning to the root"—one version mistakenly writes *yu* ("foolish") for *gen* ("root"). "My heart"—one version writes *xing* ("form") for *xin* ("heart"). "Eight minerals"—one version writes *wu* ("five") for *ba* ("eight"). "Perfecting things"—one version writes *gong* ("achievement") for *wu* ("things"). "Abandoning the times to avoid harm, taking refuge in hills and mountains, wandering the vast expanse, dwelling among ghosts, until each bears the other’s burden in stability and long life"—these sixteen phrases encapsulate the three characters of Wei Boyang’s name. "Each bears the other’s burden" refers to: *wei* (委) and *gui* (鬼) combining to form *Wei* (魏); *ren* (人) and *bai* (白) combining to form *Bo* (伯); and *fu* (阝) and *yi* (易) combining to form *Yang* (阳). One version mistakenly writes *xian* ("immortal") for *gui* ("ghost") and *e* ("distress") for *fu* ("mound"); another alters "each bears the other’s burden, stability and long life" to "the fortunate bear one another, hidden and long-lived"; yet another reads "the fortunate bear one another’s burden, stable and long-lived." All are incorrect. Another version writes "east, west, south, north" for "east, west, south, slanting"; and "flood, drought, and warfare" for "flood and drought separated." The *Collected Works* edition emends *lu huo* (炉火) to *lu huo* (炉火). The character *bai* (白) was originally written as *zi* (自), corrected here per the *Siku* edition. "Eulogy: Resolving Doubts." "Establishing governance"—one version reads "holding the ultimate pole."

The phrase "rice and salt" here follows the *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices*. "Rice and salt divided" is akin to saying "black and white clearly distinguished." One version mistakenly writes *kan* (坎, Water) and *li* (离, Fire) for "rice and salt." Another alters *yi* (易, Changes) to *jing* (经, Classic). In "establishing commentary," one version incorrectly substitutes *fa* (法, method) for *zhu* (注, commentary). For "for this," one version replaces *ci* (此, this) with *wu* (吾, I).
