**Preface to The Nine-Chapters Scripture of Internal Alchemy of the Southern Unification Perfected Lord**

During the Kaiyuan era, I composed *The Treatise on the Mysterious Principle* and *The Treatise on Nurturing Form*, which circulated in the world. I was summoned to serve as Prefect of Jiangzhou but declined the appointment. Retreating into obscurity, I concealed myself at Mount Li, cultivating fetal breathing. By the Yuanhe era, I traveled to Huaixi, where I encountered the imperial army suppressing the rebellion of Wu Yuanji, the traitor of Cai. To evade the chaos, I fled to the mountains, where I met Li the Banished Immortal. He bestowed upon me this method of defense, saying: "This is the Gate of Life of the Southern Unification Perfected Lord. Entering this gate, your life rests in your own hands."

The nine chapters correspond to the number of yang lines in the hexagrams. Though the text is concise and its matters brief, it is truly the gradual steps of the Daoist path and the true way to seek life. He further said: "Internal alchemy is precisely this." Today, I transmit it to you, but beware—do not reveal it to those without the vessel or capacity to harmonize the numinous spirits, lest you incur disaster.

The essence of the nine chapters is to be passed down to later generations, but it is not to be taught to those of middling or lesser talent. Thus, I record this preface.

Written by Wu Jun in the *wuxu* year of the Yuanhe era of the Tang.

**The Nine-Chapters Scripture of Internal Alchemy of the Southern Unification Perfected Lord**

**Chapter One: The Wise and the Foolish Differ in Substance**

To humble oneself and seek the Dao, with aspirations soaring beyond the Milky Way—this is the superior person. To squander longevity and harm one’s nature, content to dwell in the dark earth below—this is the foolish and benighted.

The Perfected Lord said: Humans originally emerged with Heaven and Earth from the Void. Why then can Heaven and Earth attain their full span of years, while humans cannot preserve their forms? It is not that the Dao betrays humanity, but that humanity betrays the Dao. The wise and the foolish differ in substance; the pure and the turbid follow separate paths.

Thus, my Dao is not the path of ascending to Heaven. It is the path of gathering the spirit to form the Dao. When the spirit gathers, internal alchemy is accomplished, and one preserves their form.

**Chapter Two: The Radiance of the Spirit**

Ordinary people also use this to divine fortune and misfortune: yellow is auspicious, white is inauspicious, green portends worry, and black signifies death. Other omens are not permitted to be known.

Avoid chaotic sounds, sever licentious desires, refrain from excessive drunkenness, and observe the moment between night’s end and dawn’s first light. Face left and right to perceive it. If it flashes like lightning and its radiance is vast and round, it is the sign of attaining longevity. With time, the round brilliance will envelop the body, like a shooting star scattering its rays—such is the omen of the Dao’s flourishing.

The Perfected Lord said: First, strike the Heavenly Drum, rest your head on the pillow, and gather the light. Calm the heart and close the eyes, visualizing the sun. The sun resides above the Gate of the Palace, and the moon lies outside the Cinnabar Field. In deep sleep, the spirit is tranquil, and the qi is upright.

**Chapter Three: Audience with the Dipper**

The year has three origins, and the month has three sevens. Purify the heart, sit upright, clasp the hands firmly, and meditate with closed eyes. Imagine arriving at the Golden Palace, as if beholding the imperial countenance. Bow in reverence, prostrate, and pay homage, just as one would in an audience with the Son of Heaven. When finished, withdraw with trembling awe, shoulders hunched, and swiftly depart. Wash away worldly cares, cease all distractions, and purify the heart. Then, the audience with the origin may occur at any time. In the deep of night, within a secluded chamber, face the Northern Asterism and perform this method—ease of spiritual communion will follow.

---

**Chapter Four: The Gengshen Night**

Ordinary people who keep vigil on this night without sleeping do not follow the original method. On the Gengshen night, prepare incense and fire in the oratory. Sit upright, clasp the hands firmly, and first strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times. When the spirit is gathered, next visualize the hundred spirits within the body emerging, all dressed in caps and swords with solemn dignity, standing guard before, behind, left, and right. Then, lead them to pay homage to the Supreme Dao Lord, just as in the method of audience with the Dipper.

Practicing this for three years, neither weapons nor tigers can harm you. The Three Corpses dare not linger, and in dreams, tall and beautiful maidens will bestow rare flowers and exotic fruits—these are the responses of spiritual communion and the auspicious omens of extended longevity.

**Chapter Five: Cultivating Yang Virtue**

No good deed is too small, for all are tied to yang; no evil deed is too small, for all belong to yin. Accumulating good deeds and magnifying them, yang qi flourishes and brings forth auspiciousness. Accumulating evil deeds and deepening them, yin qi arises and brings forth calamity.

Thus, those who seek longevity first rely on yin virtue and later welcome yang retribution—such is the way to distant years.

The Perfected Lord said: Those who follow this path all enter the register of immortals. Ingesting numinous herbs, their countenance remains robust and ageless. Medicinal wealth serves as the lining, while the art serves as the outer garment. The hundred spirits gather easily, and the form may be preserved for long.

**Chapter Six: Guiding and Drawing Forth Original Yang**

When the hundred joints are opened and unobstructed, the five viscera are all regulated. When the six palaces are all massaged, perverse qi cannot enter. The Heavenly Drum resounds, and nightmares and impurities are all dispelled. Original qi flows through the pathways of fluids, and wherever the qi and fluids reach, the bones and marrow become like metal, and the spirit must be unimpeded.

After guiding and drawing forth, stabilize the breath and sound the Heavenly Drum to gather the spirit. Then, exhale with the sounds *xu*, *he*, *hu*, *xi*, *yan*, and *chui*, ensuring they are not heard by the ears. With time, pure qi accumulates within, and turbid, impure qi dissipates.

The Perfected Lord said: Though the elixir may not yet be complete, the spirit is already empty and luminous. When original yang qi is balanced, one attains long life.

---

**Chapter Seven: The Taboos of Yin**

Thunder, lightning, torrential rain, and great winds that uproot trees—these are manifestations of great anger, and even ghosts and spirits are terrified. Therefore, stand with hands clasped, bow in reverence, and tremble with awe. Rest in the forest, and do not engage in conjugal relations. Those who violate this will have their life spans stolen by ghosts and spirits, and their illnesses will be difficult to cure.

The Perfected Lord said: When Heaven’s majesty is enraged, yin spirits all tremble in fear. With time, yin demons flee, the register of death is erased, and the hundred spirits assist—this is called ascending the chariot of fortune and shattering the vehicle of misfortune.

**Chapter Eight: Habituation to the Near Brings Life**

Cold demeanor is the step to premature death; lewd sounds are the axe that severs nature; fine delicacies and goblets of wine are the drugs that disorder the spirit; carriages, caps, sashes, and official robes are the adornments that burden the form. Though these four perils are widely known, none can abandon them. Those who cannot abandon them are called "walking corpses."

The path to ascending to Heaven is distant, but the path to preserving life is near. Thus, it is better to habituate oneself to the near.

The Perfected Lord said: When the spirit gathers, it becomes numinous; when qi is pure, it becomes light.

When spirit gathers and qi is pure, this is called guarding the form, this is called preserving life.

**Chapter Nine: Resonance with the Seven Luminaries**

With the heart revering the radiance of the Seven Stars and the feet treading their steps, the tracks must not overlap. Tread the number forty-nine, turn to look back while grasping firmly, and strike the celestial drum. With eyes closed, visualize the Azure Dragon to the left and the White Tiger to the right.

Thus it is said: If I do not seek the Real, the Real will surely follow me. When the spirit attains the Real qi, the hundred spirits all protect it.

To receive the Real qi, one must encounter a Perfected Person—perhaps in a dream journeying through seas and mountains, seeing dragons and beasts all clad in white, or the palaces and gardens of the Son of Heaven. This is the spirit uniting with the form, and life’s defense is thus established.

Thereafter, report to the Original Spirit and pay homage to the Star of Longevity; the Celestial Pass will then be unimpeded.

**Postscript**

The two stars *Jiao* and *Kang* of the Eastern Palace, the elders of the constellations, are thus called the Stars of Longevity. Between these two stars lies the Gate of Heaven, also called the Celestial Pass. All who attain the Dao and ascend to the Origin must enter through this gate. Those who obtain this Way report to the Original Spirit and resonate with the Star of Longevity, whereupon their names are recorded at the Celestial Pass. When merit is complete and they ascend to Heaven, the Original Hour escorts them through the gate, and thus there is no hindrance.

I toiled for forty years before achieving even a single degree, and knowing my fate to be meager, I then turned to seeking the Real. I studied the immortals’ scriptures but found no principle of life. Traveling south, I visited the traces of Lord Mao’s cultivation, ascending Mao Peak and entering the stone chamber, where I first obtained the *Original Dao True Scripture*—the principle of the Most High Lord of the Dao returning to the root and restoring the origin, a teaching that does not wane.

I held to this principle for over a decade, focusing solely on embryonic breathing. Though I persisted, alas, it was not the eyelash before my eyes. Later, on another journey, I met an old man who asked: "Do you wish to learn immortality?" He said: "To learn immortality is to move from the dust into the Real, like refining ore to smelt gold. Why not first seek the art of destiny to prolong life, then cultivate hidden virtue, and ascend its gradual steps? As for Heavenly Immortals, their merit moves Heaven, which then bestows a mandate, enabling them to lightly ascend and become immortals. Even after reaching the immortal realm, they still refine Real qi, for qi and spirit must merge—hence the term *spirit-immortal*. Spirit-immortals embody emptiness, thus they can ride simurghs and cranes, mount clouds and qi to soar through the Great Void, their longevity matching Heaven and Earth. The *Original Dao True Scripture* you obtained is but the snare and trap for seeking immortality—vast and boundless, like searching for fish and rabbits.

Long ago, Lord Mao ascended, leaving the *Great Lord’s Life Defense* hidden in the stone chamber atop the mountain, entrusting me to guard it, intending to transmit it to one of predestined affinity. You, with your solitary qi pure and clear, must possess immortal bones." Thereupon, he produced these nine chapters and bestowed them upon me before departing, charging me: "This is the very fish and rabbit you seek. The Dao is not outside the self—treasure it! Treasure it!"

I then recorded its teachings in this postscript to commemorate it, entitling it *The Inner Elixir Divine Formula*.
