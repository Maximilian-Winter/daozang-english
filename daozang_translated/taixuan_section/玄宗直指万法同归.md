### **Wuji (Non-Ultimate)**
This is the pure essence of inherent nature—namely, the **Taiji (Supreme Ultimate)**.
The true void within being, the nameless origin of heaven and earth.

### **Taiji (Supreme Ultimate)**
This is the undifferentiated state of principle and qi—namely, the **Yuanji (Primal Ultimate)**.
The wondrous being within non-being, the named mother of the myriad things.

### **Preface to the Wuji-Taiji Diagram**
**Wuji** signifies that which is "ultimately without ultimate," the true void within non-being.
Before the One Origin manifested form, before the Two Qi emerged, there was only emptiness, profound and vacant, still and unmoving.
This is the nameless beginning of heaven and earth.
Later generations forcibly named it *Wuji* or *Taiyi (Great Simplicity)*.

From the extremity of stillness, movement arises; from ceaseless movement, qi is born.
When qi and principle intermingle in chaos, the Three Powers (heaven, earth, humanity) take shape, and the Way of transformation is born.
This is the named mother of the myriad things—hence, the **Taiji**.

The *Classic of Changes* states: *"The Changes possess the Taiji, which generates the Two Modes."*
The *Changes* refer to the **Wuji**.
From the Wuji arises the Taiji; from the Taiji arise Qian (Heaven) and Kun (Earth).
Qian separates into Li (Fire), giving birth to the sun; Kun divides into Kan (Water), giving birth to the moon.
The Four Images are established, the Eight Trigrams arrayed; yin and yang unite, and male and female are born—thus begins human ethics.
From Li and Zhen (Thunder) to Kan and Dui (Lake), day and night are distinguished, and the four seasons revolve.
Thus, in heaven, images are formed; on earth, shapes take substance.
That which congeals without dispersing becomes mountains and peaks; that which flows without stagnation becomes rivers and streams.
That which sprouts from the land becomes grasses and trees; that which lurks in marshes and deeps becomes scaled and shelled creatures.
Crawling things are called "fur"; flying things, "feather."
From this, cold and heat alternate, dampness and dryness interact; emotions and artifices intertwine, essences and qi converge.
All creatures—whether sentient or insentient—proliferate endlessly.

### **On the Wondrous Being of Wuji**
**Wuji** is the true void of the **Taiji**.
**Taiji** is the wondrous being of the **Wuji**.
The true void is the origin of inherent nature.
The wondrous being is the origin of qi.
When wondrous being first coalesces in chaos, the image of Qian (Heaven) is formed.
Two Qian become Kun (Earth); once Qian and Kun are established, human ethics and the myriad things arise—thus is the Way of nature and destiny founded.
As for the balancing of the Four Images, the arrangement of the Five Phases, the circulation of the Eight Trigrams, the guidance of the Three Origins, the succession of decline and renewal, the alternation of prosperity and decay—these are merely the flowing and revolving of the two qi of yin and yang.
Yet the fundamental void of the Wuji remains unchanged.
Above the Taiji, it is quiescent and formless; below the Two Modes, it does not shift with things.
Though named *Taiyi (Great Simplicity)*, *Taichu (Great Beginning)*, *Taisu (Great Simplicity)*, or *Taishi (Great Commencement)*, their designations differ, but their Way is one.

However, the Taiji receives its mandate from the Wuji; Qian and Kun receive theirs from the Taiji; humans and things receive theirs from Qian and Kun—this is the unbroken continuity.
It is not that the Taiji is born outside the Wuji, or that Qian and Kun are born outside the Taiji, or that humans and things are born outside Qian and Kun.
It begins with the true void of principle and culminates in the wondrous being of qi.

### **On Wuji and Taiji as Principle and Qi**
**Wuji** refers to pure principle.
Only with this principle does qi arise; when principle and qi intermingle in chaos, this is called the **Taiji**—the named mother of the myriad things.
When the Three Powers are established and the myriad things are born:
The principle that equalizes things is called *nature*.
The qi that endows things is called *destiny*.
The nature and destiny of humans and things are none other than the principle and qi within heaven and earth.
The principle and qi within heaven and earth are what humans and things receive as their nature and destiny.
At the beginning, principle and qi are indistinct in the Taiji; in the end, heaven and earth are replete with principle and qi.
Principle does not exist alone apart from qi; qi does not stand uniquely apart from principle.
That which endures with the Three Powers and the myriad things without end is principle and qi.
Yet the substance of principle is still and formless; the mechanism of qi is dynamic yet formless.
That which is still and formless is the **Dao**.
That which moves and takes form is the *instrument*.
It begins with the Wuji, culminates in the Taiji, divides into the Two Modes, and disperses into the myriad kinds.
Yet principle and qi have never been separate, never ceased, and never increased or diminished.

### **The Source of Nature and Destiny**
The Taiji is formless; it first generates the One.
The One divides into the numbers of water and fire.
When One and Two pair, the body of Qian is completed—this is the primordial origin of nature and destiny, the wellspring of human ethics and the myriad things.
Thus, Qian is split to form Kun; the Two Modes are established, and the Four Images stand.
The Eight Trigrams are arrayed, and day and night alternate.
From the initial division of Qian, nature and destiny diverge.
The *Classic of Changes* states: *"The Way of Qian transforms, each rectifying its nature and destiny."*
Before the Way of Qian divided, water and fire were inherently complete.
When the Way of Qian transforms and divides to form Kun, the myriad things receive the qi apportioned by Qian and Kun, each rectifying its nature and destiny to be born.
This is the descent of Qian’s origin, the flowing of forms into the myriad things.
Thus, that which is complete in Qian is yang; that which is divided in Kun is yin.
The establishment of yin enables the myriad things to rely upon it for birth.
That which possesses the completeness of Qian is called *nature*; that which receives the division of Kun is called *destiny*.
Receiving the One of water is *essence*; receiving the Two of fire is *spirit*.
That which possesses the completeness of nature, destiny, essence, and spirit is called the **Dao**.

○ Water (One) and fire (Two) combine to form Qian—this is the wondrous self-possession of water and fire within Qian’s origin.
The origin of destiny is the beginning of inherent nature.
When One divides into Two, the one body ceases to exist, and the two bodies come into being.
When they unite as One, the one body exists, and the two bodies cease to be.

This is the mutual transformation of being and non-being. Thus, the Great Dao takes non-being as its essence and being as its function. Therefore, the true non-being of *Wuji* is the *Taiji*, and the wondrous being of *Taiji* is the *Wuji*.

The inception of Qian was originally non-being, yet through the establishment of the One, an image is formed. The inception of Kun was originally non-being, yet through the division of Qian, a form is shaped. The interplay of division and union, being and non-being—this is the great root of yin, yang, and the myriad things.

○ The primordial Qian, water and fire, yin and yang, nature and destiny, essence and spirit—these are self-contained. Thus, Qian’s nature aligns with the Dao; human nature aligns with Qian. By uniting with Qian and following Kun, nature is perfected and destiny is restored.

Qian divides to become Kun; Kun unites to return to Qian. Through the division and union of these two bodies, nature and destiny are made complete. Thus, when Boyang cultivated immortality, the *Cantong Qi* took the *Yi* as its model, declaring that nature and destiny are nothing more than Qian and Kun, and essence and spirit are nothing more than Kan and Li. Yet Qian and Kun, Kan and Li are nothing more than the One. The One is nothing more than the *Taiji*. The *Taiji* is nothing more than the *Wuji*.

Before the One took form, it was the beginningless beginning of the *Taiji*. Once the One was established, it became the beginning of the *Taiji*. The beginningless is the inception of nature; the beginning is the inception of destiny. When these two beginnings unite, the Dao of Qian is fulfilled.

Nature begins in non-being, whence arises the empty and numinous awareness. Destiny begins in being, whence arises the flowing cycle of generation and decay. The opposition of being and non-being, the interplay of movement and stillness—thus is the Dao of transformation established.

Yet the one body encompasses two: the body of Qian encompasses Kun. Without awaiting transformation, water and fire, yin and yang are already complete. To unify the *Taiji* and preserve the primordial Qian, to embrace the formless and encompass the two beginnings—this is the work of the sagely origin. To unite form and the origin, encompassing the two beginnings—this is the enterprise of the sage.

**Sequence of Nature, Principle, Spirit, Qi, and Destiny**
The Dao precedes the *Taiji* and is called *nature*; nature exists between heaven and earth and is called *principle*; the wondrous awareness of principle is called *spirit*; the empty and numinous spirit unites with *qi*; *qi* bestowed upon things is called *destiny*.

The *Yi* states: "That which is quiescent and unmoving is the essence of nature. That which responds and thereby penetrates is the function of spirit." Nature extends to all things without exception; principle is impartial toward all things; spirit responds to all things without fail; *qi* accomplishes all things without omission.

That which is inherently non-active is *nature*; that which is universally possessed by things is *principle*; that which is mysteriously penetrating and wondrously aware is *spirit*; that which ceaselessly moves and flows is *qi*. Rooted in nature, following principle, preserved in spirit, and generated by *qi*—this is *destiny*.

**Diagram of the Ten Thousand Dharmas Returning to the One**
The One is the mother of the ten thousand dharmas. Thus, two Ones make Two; two Twos make Four; doubling Four makes Eight; doubling Eight makes Sixteen; combining these yields Thirty-Two; doubling Thirty-Two makes Sixty-Four. Sixty-Four forms Three Hundred Eighty-Four. Excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, the twenty-four remaining yield Three Hundred Sixty, corresponding to one cycle.

Thus, Qian’s tally is two hundred sixteen; Kun’s tally is one hundred forty-four. Combined, the tallies of Qian and Kun number fifteen thousand one hundred twenty. Therefore, one number gives rise to one thing; one thing possesses one dharma; within one dharma, further dharmas arise. In sum, they are called the ten thousand.

In the beginning, names are established upon the One; meanings are established upon names; affairs are established upon meanings; capacities are established upon affairs; offices are established upon capacities; functions are established upon offices; achievements are established upon functions; distinctions are established upon achievements; marvels are established upon distinctions; rightness is established upon marvels; wrongness is established upon rightness.

Once right and wrong are established, the foolish are distinguished from the wise; obstruction from penetration; excess from scarcity; scarcity from multitude; sameness from difference; equality from gradation; centrality from bias; uprightness from deviance; greatness from smallness; refinement from coarseness. Accumulating and layering these, multiplying them further—from this point onward, even the most skillful reckoning cannot fathom them.

Thirty thousand eight hundred names arise according to circumstances, all entangled in the interplay of things and the adaptability of the human mind. How could the beginning of *Wuji* possess such distinctions?

The wise must gather the ten thousand dharmas into the One, returning to their origin and reverting to their root. Once the One is restored, the ten thousand dharmas revolve back to their source. Thus, the sage unifies them with the One. It is said: though the ten thousand things are many, their governance is one. Without unifying them with the One, they would merely be ten thousand upon ten thousand.

**Unifying the Ten Thousand Dharmas**
As for the ten thousand dharmas in the world: if the vast ocean were a mouth and the Yellow River a tongue, they could not fully distinguish their right and wrong. If Kunlun were a brush and the azure sky paper, they could not fully describe their conditions.

The baser the age, the more dharmas mutate; the more cunning people become, the more the Dao diverges. Thus, as soon as the one source stirs, the ten thousand dharmas rush forth in chaos—like rain lashing a thicket, like wind howling through a hundred hollows—tumultuous and clamorous, none knowing how to restrain them.

Even if Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor were to re-establish the laws, or Confucius and Laozi were to discourse again on the profound, they could not suppress the source once set in motion. The multitude of the ten thousand dharmas, their vastness—those who seek to exhaust them with clever schemes only render them unequal, and thus they remain unequal.

What unifies them? The One alone. What is the One? It is the convergence of their ultimate and the return to their ultimate. Yet the ten thousand dharmas are empty and illusory; the One, too, arises from delusion. If the One does not move, the ten thousand dharmas do not arise. I shall unify them with the One.

The ten thousand dharmas are the same as self and other, equal to heaven and earth—how could they not be unified? Those who claim the One cannot be reverted to, or the dharmas cannot be unified, have not awakened to the principle of unification.

**Diagram of the Three Teachings Sharing the Same Origin**
The Three Vehicles and Four Fruits of the Buddhist path; the hundred schools and various masters of the Confucian path; the Three Realms and multitude of immortals of the Daoist path—

Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism: A Parable of the Three Teachings Sharing the Same Origin.

To govern the world by exhausting principle, none surpasses Confucianism. To transcend life and death, none surpasses Buddhism. To revert to destiny and master the Three Powers, none surpasses Daoism. These three traditions share the same Supreme Ultimate, the same nature and principle, standing like a tripod between China and the barbarian lands, each with education as its core. Their origin is one, their contemplation is one, their embrace of all principles is one—like a city embracing its people, the sea embracing all rivers, a cauldron embracing all flavors, the body embracing its nine orifices, or heaven and earth embracing the ten thousand things.

What is prized is stillness, not movement; clarity, not turbidity. In stillness, the ten thousand thoughts do not arise; in movement, the ten thousand mechanisms all activate. In clarity, spirit and illumination gather; in turbidity, stupidity and darkness congeal.

To govern heaven and earth, to store the ten thousand things, to unite spirit and essence, to harmonize the six qi—all depend on the functioning of the heart-mind. The ancients could not name it, so they gave it a word. With this, they symbolized the Three Powers and the ten thousand dharmas.

*"Fufu"*—to be complete within the Infinite is called *nature*; to be divided from the Supreme Ultimate is called *destiny*; what the Dao deems so is called *principle*; to encompass all principles is called the *heart-mind*. The heart-mind, when spoken of in relation to the ten thousand dharmas, is vast in form and empty in substance, wondrously aware and mysteriously penetrating, containing all existence. Originally, it has no names such as good or evil, small or great—it is how humans and things put it to use. That their later applications differ is why later ages differ.

It is like three brothers born of the same parents who, by misfortune, lose their parents early and drift apart to foreign lands. When they grow up, each inherits a different house and changes his surname. If the lords of these three houses should dispute over land and people, and the three brothers, each wielding absolute wisdom, devise strategies, deploy troops, and command armies, meet on the plains of the Central Kingdom—some attacking from the left, some from the right, some from the center—though their arrows clash and blades cross, none can ultimately subdue the others. Why? Because their strength and wisdom are equal, and victory or defeat is hard to determine.

A discerning person says: "Once born of the same parents, now they are enemies—what is to be done?" Though they wish to disband their armies, release their grievances, blend their light, and share the dust, they exhaust their hearts and minds. The heart-mind in heaven is the heart-mind of heaven; on earth, the heart-mind of humanity; in the world, the heart-mind of the world; in the ten thousand things, the heart-mind of the ten thousand things—yet it is but one heart-mind. Abandon the thing, and you grasp its name.

The heart-mind is originally without constancy, yet by use it becomes constant. The heart-mind is originally without measure, yet by use it takes measure. The heart-mind is originally without movement, yet by use it moves. The heart-mind is originally without thought, yet by use it thinks. Using its goodness makes a good heart-mind; using its evil makes an evil heart-mind; using its smallness makes a small heart-mind; using its greatness makes a great heart-mind. With this heart-mind, one models the enclosing city walls. Thus, we know the heart-mind governs all principles.

**Diagram of Nature, Destiny, and Body in Union: An Explanation**
Nature is the wonder of the primordial spirit. All things equally receive it—its substance is utterly still, utterly empty, utterly mysterious. In the sage it does not increase; in the fool it does not decrease. In antiquity it does not change; in the present it does not shift. The world’s movements cannot move its movement; the world’s ultimacy cannot reach its ultimacy—this is what we call *nature*.

Destiny is the correctness of primordial qi. Qi, in relation to things, is called *destiny* or *command*. The command is for humans to uphold heaven and earth’s natural dispositions. In things, it resides in prosperity or adversity; in principle, it is originally without life or death. The ten thousand things are impermanent—this refers to the division and limits of their physical forms. Yet the primordial destiny never breaks or continues; it moves without being summoned—this is what we call *destiny*.

The body is the root of the command. It begins without form, takes shape through the causes and conditions of parents, and truly receives heaven and earth’s correct qi. Thus, it models itself on heaven and earth to form its shape: eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue speaks, mind knows, emotions recognize, hands grasp, feet walk—this is what we call the *body*. Without the body, nature and destiny have no place to reside; without nature and destiny, the body has no master. Blended and united, they are called *human*; one who illuminates nature is called *Daoist*.

Those who treasure the body and destiny but not their nature merely lodge their breath in a single thing. Some say: "The body is impermanent, destiny is limited. If body and destiny do not endure, where does spirit reside?" I say: This body is a borrowed thing, and in the end it must return. This destiny flows and circulates. Things arise and perish—with a body, they unite to become human; when qi scatters, they return to the Dao. The sage sets the body aside, yet the body remains; the primordial spirit and primordial destiny have never been lost. To seek destiny and nature apart from the body is like seeking fish and dragons outside water, or sun and moon outside heaven.

**The Parable of the Ox-Cart and Treasure: An Explanation of Body, Nature, and Destiny**
Nature is what humans are endowed with—no thing lacks it. The body is humanity’s foundation, the lodging place of nature and destiny. Destiny is the sequence of qi, the source of all arising. Receiving the mandate of heaven to become human is to uphold heaven and earth’s natural dispositions.

Without destiny, the body cannot establish its root; without the body, destiny has no way to preserve its life. Without body and destiny, nature cannot lodge its numinosity, nor be perfected in goodness. These three cannot be separated from their root even for an instant.

Now, let us borrow a treasure to represent nature, a cart to represent the body, and an ox to represent destiny. The treasure is a precious object; the cart is a vessel for bearing loads; the ox is a creature that carries and moves. If you place the treasure on the cart and then harness the ox to it, as the ox moves, the cart moves, and the treasure is carried upon it. The ox can move but cannot bear loads; the cart can bear loads but cannot move. Though the treasure is precious, without the ox and cart, it cannot be carried.

Thus, without the cart, the ox has nothing to transport; without the treasure, the cart has nothing to bear. Therefore, the treasure remains at ease while the ox and cart labor. The cart is a composite thing: it moves along the Way by means of the ox and carries its load by means of the treasure. Without such composition, they cannot serve their functions together. Yet all composites must eventually part, and all that is followed must eventually decay. Like the ox that must die and the cart that must break, they come to their end. Only the treasure, not being composite, endures alone.

From this we see that the body’s demise is the constant of all that lives, and destiny’s exhaustion is the constant of all that flows. That which does not perish with body and destiny is only the principle of nature. Failing to illuminate one’s nature is to abandon the treasure and not take it. Ignorant of destiny is to abandon the ox and not harness it. Neglecting the body is to abandon the cart and not use it—until the ox dies, the cart breaks, and the treasure is lost. How lamentable!

**Yin and Yang Take Stillness as Their Master**

That yang moves and yin is still, that yang is clear and yin is turbid, is known to all. But that stillness is their master is unknown to the world. The substance of the Great Ultimate is fundamentally still; its movement depends on stillness, and only after stillness can it move. Without stillness first, movement cannot follow. Thus, in the Way of the Three Powers, stillness is the master of movement.

Moreover, stillness gives rise to nature, movement gives rise to *qi*; stillness gives rise to benevolence, movement gives rise to wisdom. All things under heaven arise from what movement thus generates. Now, yang moves, but its root must be still; yin is turbid, but its root must be clear. Stillness is the substance of movement, movement the function of stillness. From this we see that stillness is at ease while movement labors, stillness is noble while movement is base. Without stillness, how could the movements of the world be unified? Without clarity, how could the turbidity of the world be illuminated?

Thus, the sage takes perfect stillness as the Dao—not because yang is debased and yin exalted, but because it is the beginning of the Great Ultimate. Though heaven moves, it contains stillness within movement; though earth is still, it contains movement within stillness. Without stillness, heaven could not respond to the conditions of the myriad things; without movement, earth could not bring forth the life of the myriad things. Thus, within *qian*, yin at its center forms *li*, the image of the sun; within *kun*, yang at its center forms *kan*, the image of the moon. This shows that yang must take stillness as its substance, and yin must take movement as its foundation.

The stillness of heaven’s body is why it is ever more firm and strong; the movement of earth’s body is why it ceaselessly generates. Thus, the marvel of heaven and earth lies in their constant response and constant stillness. Yang moving and yin still is the true substance of heaven and earth; yang clear and yin turbid is their true form; yang firm and yin soft is their true principle; yang noble and yin base is their true position.

Their rising and falling is the ascent and descent of yin and yang; their staying and coming is the alternation of yin and yang; day and night are the brightness and obscurity of yin and yang; cold and heat are the shifting of yin and yang. As for that which fills the space between heaven and earth without change, that which pervades the six directions without alteration, whose end cannot be seen when exhausted, whose beginning cannot be seen when traced, which is utterly still and fundamentally so—this transcends the forms of yin and yang and the *qi* of cold and heat.

**The *Wan* Character and the Wheel Diagram: A Buddhist Explanation**

Chen Dunzhai says: This diagram is most wondrous, bridging the profound mysteries of Buddhism to the gateway of Confucianism—something no great spiritual master of the past has ever expounded. The Buddhists inscribe the character *wan* (卍) upon the heart as a symbolic teaching. They call it a wheel, with its two parts intersecting and balancing the four images, aligning with the eight trigrams. Its intersections form warp and weft, beginning and end. At its center, it unites the five phases, the five constants, the five *qi*, and the five precepts. In the sutras, it is the four phrases; in humans, it is the four great elements.

The mysteries of yin and yang, nature and destiny, Dao and virtue, benevolence and righteousness, spirit and soul, mercury and lead, dragon and tiger, *qian* and *li*, *kun* and *kan*—all are equally contained within it. Its advance is level, its retreat is level; it can proceed forward or backward, accommodate four or five, eight or nine. Vertically it is boundless, horizontally it is boundless; the principles of heaven and humanity are all encompassed within it. Thus, the Buddhists inscribe it upon the heart, symbolizing the Dharma Wheel within, turning without cease.

Its sound is *wan* (万, "ten thousand"), signifying that the myriad things arise from this Way. Tracing its root, it is the character *shi* (十, "ten"). It begins with one, is completed in five, made whole in ten, and embraces the ten thousand. The *wan* character is the sinuous form of *shi*, embodying the meaning of both curved and straight paths. Thus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* repeatedly employs the number ten from beginning to end, signifying the equality of above and below, the interchange of substance and function, with nothing lacking or in excess, nothing high or low—like the wheel-treasure of the wish-fulfilling gem, adorned all around, from which all principles and meanings derive. Its significance is profound, beyond words.

**The Mean, the True Constant, and the Eternal**

That which neither exceeds nor falls short is called the Mean; that which neither changes nor deviates is called the Constant. The Mean is the supreme norm between the two modes, the supreme principle within the human heart. The Constant is the ultimate existence under heaven, the unchanging norm through all ages.

In Buddhism, this is called the Eternal; in the teachings of the Most High, it is called the True Constant. The Eternal does not change, embodying the meaning of unceasing flow. The True Constant means no delusion, no alteration. Yao and Shun practiced it in their abdication; Confucius and Mencius transmitted it in their teachings; the Buddha used it to transform the myriad kinds; the Most High employed it to govern the Three Powers—this is the Way.

The Mean is the ultimate Way of the Confucians; the Eternal is the ultimate Way of the Buddhists; the True Constant is the ultimate Way of the Most High.

Though times differ between ancient and modern, and the Dao rises and falls, its essence remains the same while its applications vary—this is not because the principles ordained by the sages differ. The sages merely employ different teachings to convey the Way of the Supreme Ultimate, which begins in nature and ends in destiny. The establishment of the Three Powers is encompassed by nothing beyond this, and the birth of the myriad things does not exceed it.

Though the Two Modes are vast, the winds and soils vary, and the multitude of beings differ, each receives its nature and destiny to come into being. Though their kinds differ, the Supreme Ultimate has never been other than the same. Thus, the Buddhists employ it to transform the world and return to original nature; the Daoists employ it to transform the world and return to primordial qi; the Confucians employ it to transform the world and return to original destiny. Without nature, the subtlety of the great Dao cannot be illuminated; without qi, the origin of the Supreme Ultimate cannot be manifested; without destiny, the great work of teaching and transformation cannot be carried out. These three—transcending form and instrument, the mother of qi, the rectification of the great ethical order—are the root of heaven and humanity. The Three Powers cannot depart from them even for an instant.

Thus, in grasping them, there is essence and function; in attaining them, there is before and after. This is not a matter of excess or deficiency. Tracing their beginning and end, Buddhism is the Dao; the Dao is Confucianism. Yet today, some say that Buddhism’s quiescent extinction is far from human sentiment, that the Dao’s purity and emptiness are insufficient to govern the world, and that Confucianism’s names and principles are insufficient to transcend life and death. These are but partial views, each clinging to one side amid gains and losses. The principle of the sages is one and the same—there is no distinction of depth or shallowness. When applied to the world, it is merely that their teachings differ.

If one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return to the Constant. The Constant means unchanging; purity is the nature of heaven, and stillness is the nature of earth. The principle of heaven and earth values constancy, and thus it is taken as the One Dao. If heaven were not pure, it could not reach its utmost height and suspend the myriad images. If earth were not still, it could not thicken its depths and bear the myriad things. If its virtue were not constant, heaven could collapse, earth could sink, the sun could grow cold, the moon could turn hot, the four seasons could reverse, and the myriad things could fall into chaos. Only because of its constancy can it remain unchanged through the myriad things, past and present.

Moreover, humans are shaped in the image of heaven and earth, their destiny formed by the union of yin and yang. They receive the subtlety of the one numinous spirit, and should naturally abide in purity and stillness. Yet they are drowned by the turmoil of cares at dawn, entangled by the confusion of love and desire, and thus their constancy is disturbed, their purity muddied, and their stillness set in motion. Therefore, they cannot endure as long as heaven and earth or unite with the great Dao in its truth. If one can truly accord with constancy, unite with purity and stillness, how could heaven and earth not return all their subtlety to them?

*Scripture on Salvation: The Primordial Treasure Pearl of the Origin*

The Origin is the head of the Great Void and Emptiness. It emerges above the Supreme Ultimate and dwells before the Nine Qi. Its qi descends to become Qian, divides to become Kun, and unites to become humanity. The Three Luminaries, the Five Phases, the Four Seasons, and the Eight Trigrams—none are not established by the mysterious Primordial Three Qi.

As the *Book of Changes* says: "Great indeed is the Primal Power of Qian, from which all things receive their beginning." This is its source. The Primordial One Qi is utterly pure, utterly still, utterly non-action, utterly refined and unified. It is the ancestor of the myriad ways, the root of the myriad spirits, the head of the myriad transformations, and the foundation of the myriad things. It is originally without name or speech, so the Heavenly Worthy borrows names and words to name and speak of it.

The Scripture says: The Heavenly Worthy of the Origin suspended a treasure pearl, as large as a grain of millet, in the emptiness of the mysterious void, silent and without lingering resonance. This passage of the Scripture is the Heavenly Worthy’s expedient means to guide and transform all beings, each expression having its significance.

The treasure pearl is the one aperture of the Mysterious Female, the wondrous existence of True Emptiness, the root of water, fire, and the Primal Power of Qian, and the nature and wisdom of the myriad spirits. It dwells within the empty mystery. "Empty" signifies that the source has no origin; "mysterious" signifies that being arises from non-being. That it is five feet above the earth signifies the round number of the great reckoning of the Five Phases—wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—unified as one. Earth, belonging to the center, governs the Four Images of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui. This pearl must be five feet above the earth, neither too high nor too low, signifying that the one aperture of the Mysterious Female first emerges at the head of the Five Phases and finally resides within the Five Qi.

The Origin ascends and leads the perfected celestial spirits into the treasure pearl, signifying that the subtlety of the One Qi contains and emits the Ten Voids, encompasses the Three Ultimates, enters the minute without fail, and embraces the vast without omission. When humans and celestials look up, they see only a surging movement entering the mouth of the pearl—this signifies that the one aperture of the Mysterious Female is the gate of the myriad wonders. The Origin draws all beings with the wondrousness of the One True, entering through this wondrous gate.

Once within the mouth of the pearl, none know where they are—this signifies that all beings return through this wondrous gate. Thus, their wisdom roams in the formless, and their nature unites with the Great Void, hence the saying "none know where they are." Therefore, when the people of the kingdom beheld the wondrousness of the treasure pearl, they all awakened to the Dao of the Origin. Thus, the toils of the dusty world scattered, and the ground of their minds was wholly restored to levelness.

The pearl of the mind is vast and great, empty and without form, and the Three Powers and the myriad things all enter it equally. Once the pearl enters into principle, what more is there to say? Thus, it is said, "The explanation of the Scripture is complete." The Origin speaks without speaking, and the assembled perfected ones hear without hearing. Each awakens to the true principle, returns to the root, and reverts to the source—thus it is said, "The heavens return to their positions." Wisdom and nature are subtle and mysterious, neither sound nor form. Those who awaken see the entire Dharma Realm manifest; those who are deluded see not even the tip of a hair. Thus, it is said, "silent and without lingering resonance."

Therefore, the Most High first revealed the subtlety of the treasure pearl to show the traces of the mind, and finally united with the silence without lingering resonance to merge with the emptiness of the void.

This is the complete embodiment of wondrous existence and true emptiness, the full mechanism of non-non-being. The sages’ intent is profound and subtle, difficult to fathom; they must employ expedient means to reveal it to sentient beings, enabling them to seek and attain it for themselves. Thus, they first enter through the "pearl-mouth" in this manner, and the assembled perfected ones, awakening with them, guide humans and devas—all must enter through this gate.

Yet sentient beings, though their bodies bear this treasure from ancient times to the present, have never altered; it is not that only the Origin possesses this pearl. Bearing the treasure, they remain lost in their realm, and few find the gate. Moreover, though the myriad dharmas are vast and the myriad teachings extensive, a single pearl suffices to encompass them all. Beyond the pearl, what need is there for scriptures?

In praise it is said:
The Origin enters the pearl, the pearl is the Origin;
Origin and pearl are one and the same.
The explanation of the Scripture is complete,
the myriad dharmas return to the One.
Sight and sound are not alike,
merged in the chaos of the Great Ultimate.

**Confucian Four-Line Verse:**
*The human mind is perilous.*
Floating and false, never still,
susceptible to thoughts that race,
drawn into the clamor of desire,
pursuing emotions and things,
ever restless and hard to pacify—
this is called the human mind.

*The Dao-mind is subtle.*
Embodied in perfect stillness,
profound and obscure, difficult to discern,
present when principle is awakened,
beyond the grasp of emotions and measures,
unattainable by sight or hearing—
this is called the Dao-mind.

*Be refined, be unified.*
From peril to subtlety,
still the movement, return to quiescence,
the human mind and Dao-mind
reach utmost purity,
without the slightest taint of selfish desire—
this is called refinement and unity.

*Hold fast to the center.*
The perilous and subtle mind,
perfected in refinement and unity,
held as the daily practice,
accords with principle in all things,
free from the ills of bias or deviation—
this is called holding to the center.

**Daoist Four-Line Verse:**
*Seeing does not perceive the self.*
Inwardly observe the mind—
the mind has no mind;
outwardly observe the form—
the form has no form.
Merged in wondrous emptiness and stillness,
beyond the reach of emotions, knowledge, or consciousness—
this is called seeing without perceiving the self.

*Hearing does not attain sound.*
Turn the hearing inward to the self-mind,
profoundly empty and still,
utterly devoid of sound or form,
as when the Origin, within the treasure pearl,
completed the explanation of the Scripture,
in an instant—silent, without lingering resonance—
this is called hearing without attaining sound.

*Depart from all extremes.*
Free from heterodox views,
not falling into partiality or attachment,
without the ills of excess or deficiency,
departing from all extremes,
abiding in the center of the utmost center—
this is called departing from all extremes.

*Named the wondrous Dao.*
No self, no sound,
no edge, no interior,
beyond description,
untouched by sound or form,
transcending the realm of sight and hearing—
this is named the wondrous Dao.

**Buddhist Four-Line Verse:**
*No reliance on written words.*
The mind awakens of itself;
words are not the source.
The Dao is inherently complete,
principle requires no cultivation or verification—
how could it be expressed by teachings?
Thus, it is said: no reliance on written words.

*Direct transmission outside the teachings.*
Learning from the unlearnable,
mind to mind, heart to heart,
grasping meaning, forgetting words,
taking awakening as the rule,
beyond the realm of language—
this is called direct transmission outside the teachings.

*Directly pointing to the human mind.*
Only this mind-essence,
most simple, most easy,
not by paths or scriptures,
a single awakening instantly reveals the origin—
this is called directly pointing to the human mind.

*Seeing nature and becoming Buddha.*
Awakening to the true nature,
utterly empty and still,
penetrating the essence of the original mind,
wondrously attaining the ultimate principle.
Principle becomes clear and thoroughly understood—
thus, it is said: seeing nature and becoming Buddha.

As the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: "If one were to give away as many bodies as the sands of the Ganges in charity, it would not compare to upholding the four-line verse of this sūtra." This means that without realizing the Buddha’s principle, even giving away one’s body and life in charity only yields conditioned merit, whereas receiving and upholding the sūtra’s wondrous teaching leads to seeing nature and becoming Buddha. The "four lines" signify the minimal essence. If one penetrates this, there are no more scriptures to read, no more books to study in the world. Thus, for the Three Teachings, these verses distill their essentials, following the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* in naming them the "Four-Line Verses."

*Direct Pointers to the Daoist School: The Myriad Dharmas Return to the One, Fascicle One* – Complete
*Direct Pointers to the Daoist School: The Myriad Dharmas Return to the One, Fascicle Two*

The *Yangshan Daoist Abbey of Jian’an*, compiled by Mu Changchao, edited by disciple Yishan Huang Benren, with explanations by Changying and Changjing.

The celestial body is fundamentally quiescent, responding with sun, moon, clouds, and mist. The earthly body is fundamentally quiescent, responding with rivers, mountains, and the myriad things. The four seasons are fundamentally quiescent, responding with spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The human heart is fundamentally quiescent, responding with joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. Wherever there is quiescence, there is a corresponding response. Quiescence is the host; response is the guest. Quiescence is the lord; response is the minister. Quiescence is the inner substance; response is the outer function. Thus, the heart of the sage is ever unchanging yet responds to the conditions of the myriad things, ever unmoving yet responds to the transformations of the myriad things. Though engaging and responding with the myriad things, this heart never follows them in shifting or moving, and so it becomes the master of the myriad things. Though daily responding to ten thousand affairs, it suffers not the slightest loss—this is how the Most High governs the Three Powers and the myriad things. Constant response and constant quiescence: is this not the supreme virtue of the sage, the true heart of Heaven and Earth? For the scholar, this is the crucial matter of daily practice, and it must not be neglected.

**Explanation of the Chapter "The Valley Spirit Never Dies"**
The Non-Ultimate is the valley of the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate is the valley of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are the valley of the myriad things; the human heart is the valley of the host of principles. A valley receives things without ever filling, echoes sound without effort—this is the image of the human heart. *Shen* (spirit) is the supreme principle within Heaven and Earth, the supreme subtlety within the human heart. This spirit, knowing and aware, empty and numinous, responds to the heart as a valley echoes sound. Though the Three Powers may flourish or decline, this spirit never ceases or perishes—hence it is said to "never die." This is called the *Xuanpin* (Mysterious Female). *Xuan* is the primordial image of Heaven and Earth; *pin* is the true quiescent substance. Before the Three Powers were established, before the Four Images arose, the Dao was already complete. It is said, "There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth"—this is it. Whether called the Great Ultimate, nature and life, lead and mercury, or water and fire, all are wondrous names for the *Xuanpin*. The gate of the *Xuanpin* is the root of Heaven and Earth. The single aperture of the *Xuanpin* is the root and stem of Qian and Kun. All Dao issues forth from this; the Three Powers are born from this. Some explain it as the coming and going of breath through mouth and nose, the clear and the turbid—this too is the Dao, but it does not grasp the subtlety of the valley spirit.

"Subtly, subtly existing, its use is never exhausted." "Subtly" means without end. The valley possesses spirit, unbroken and undying; though the fire of kalpas burns fiercely, it remains unharmed; though the Two Modes transform, it abides forever. If one can employ it without haste or neglect, one may become infinite with the Dao.

**On the Nature School and the Life School as One Body**
The world calls Chan learning the Nature School. *Chan* is the Sanskrit *dhyāna*, here translated as "quiescent contemplation." Its foundation is purifying the heart and clarifying the spirit, stilling thoughts and ceasing concerns; its essence is forgetting form and shedding burdens, halting desires and departing from greed. In the body, it is precepts; in the heart, it is concentration; in nature, it is wisdom. The Chan School takes precepts, concentration, and wisdom as its foremost principle.

*Ming* (life) is the primordial life within the chaotic Great Ultimate. Its foundation is non-action and naturalness, wondrous being and pure emptiness; its essence is concentrating qi to attain softness, embracing the origin and guarding the One. In the kidneys, it is essence; in the body, it is qi; in the heart, it is spirit. The Life School takes essence, qi, and spirit as its foremost principle.

Precepts, concentration, and wisdom are none other than essence, qi, and spirit. Precepts nurture essence; concentration nurtures qi; wisdom nurtures spirit. Without precepts, concentration cannot arise; without concentration, wisdom cannot arise. Without precepts, essence is lost; without concentration, qi scatters; without wisdom, spirit withers. Thus, precepts, concentration, and wisdom are established through essence, qi, and spirit, while essence, qi, and spirit are perfected through precepts, concentration, and wisdom. The sages of the Three Teachings could not depart from these six words to accomplish the Dao.

Now, those who study Buddhism say, "Originally, there is not a single thing—what use are essence, qi, and spirit?" Those who study Daoism say, "I preserve essence, qi, and spirit—why need precepts, concentration, and wisdom?" Both fail to understand the root, making reckless distinctions. Thus, though learners are as numerous as ox hairs, those who succeed are as rare as unicorn horns. How lamentable!

**Explication of the *Vajracchedikā-sūtra*: The Principle of the One Composite Phenomenon**

That which possesses composite phenomena comprises the myriad things of Heaven and Earth. The composite of the formless is the nature and principle of the Tathāgata. The myriad composites cannot escape the bounds of bodily life. The composite of yin-yang and nature-principle does not transcend True Emptiness and Wondrous Being.

What is called the principle of the one composite phenomenon: *phenomena* (相) refers to affairs and things; *principle* (理) refers to nature and principle. All things—whether in form, appearance, qi, or substance—abiding between Heaven and Earth, are without exception bound by number and accord with principle. Even the creatures that fly and crawl, the sentient and the insensate—what can escape the one composite phenomenon?

Thus, the Tathāgata’s teachings necessarily proceed from the phenomenal to the formless. All sentient beings must first grasp phenomena before principle is revealed. Without phenomena, the principle of True Emptiness cannot be illuminated; without principle, the mechanism of Wondrous Being cannot be activated. Therefore, phenomena elucidate principle, and principle unites with phenomena, so that beings may realize "form is emptiness" and "mind is Buddha."

The sūtra states: "The Tathāgata speaks of the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds as not truly worlds, yet names them worlds." The explication: This describes Heaven and Earth as one composite phenomenon, vast as the world itself. Before the Great Ultimate took form, there was no such world; after the primordial mass divided, it was named "world."

The sūtra states: "If the world were truly existent, it would be a composite phenomenon." The explication: In the beginning, there was no composite form; the present world’s existence is but a composite phenomenon. For Heaven and Earth unite, sun and moon unite, yin and yang unite, male and female unite—what need to speak of the rest? This is called the one composite phenomenon.

The explication: The Tathāgata’s true nature is originally without name or form; it merely employs provisional means to approach reality, borrowing the existent to reveal the nonexistent, and in accord with the world, names it the one composite phenomenon. Yet this one composite phenomenon is inexpressible.

The explication: This one composite is the union of True Emptiness and Wondrous Being, the union of sentient beings and Buddha-nature. Laozi’s "spirit and form both wondrous" refers to this. A thousand sages do not transmit it, hence it is called "inexpressible."

But ordinary beings cling to its phenomenal aspect. Failing to comprehend Buddha-nature, they unite only with the world’s dust, toil, and afflictions, insatiably craving and clinging to phenomena, deludedly attached to every affair. Unable to awaken, they cause the single numinous true nature to drift through birth and death, entering and emerging, veiling and returning—all due to clinging to phenomena.

The explications of various sūtras differ from the Tathāgata’s intent, leading to errors. The sūtra clearly states: "If the world were truly existent, it would be a composite phenomenon," revealing the union of form and qi. Yet it also refutes this, saying: "It is not truly a composite phenomenon," thereby illuminating the union of nature and principle. This humble explication of half a chapter is offered to clarify the matter for later learners.

**Explication of Laozi’s "Valuing Life" Chapter**

The sūtra states: "Emerging into life, entering death. Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen. As people live, their actions lead them to the realm of death—also thirteen."

The explication: Life is like the sun’s rising; death, like its setting. Zhuangzi said: "Death and life are like night and day"—this is the meaning. The "thirteen" comprise the twelve stages of long life, bathing, crowning, approaching office, imperial flourishing, decline, illness, death, the grave, the womb, the embryo, and nurturing—together with one’s own body, making thirteen.

All things follow the Way of beginning and ending, the principle of yin and yang’s ebb and return. The cycles of flourishing, decline, death, and rebirth in beings and things are represented in the *Book of Changes* by *Fu* (Return) in the Kun hexagram and *Gou* (Encounter) in the Qian hexagram. The waxing and waning of yin and yang, the alternation of cold and heat, the endless transformations of creation—all follow this pattern.

All who follow life must proceed through these stages to live, and through them to die. Now, those whose actions lead them to the realm of death—even the traces of their flourishing, decline, preservation, and demise—cannot escape these thirteen stages. Who can escape this number? Only the sage, perhaps. The Buddhist "birth, aging, sickness, death" also derive from this. Is not the "veiling and returning" of which they speak these thirteen stages?

The sūtra asks: "Why is this so?" Because of the thickness of their attachment to life.

The explanation: All things are without birth, and thus attain freedom from death. Once there is birth, there must be death; once there is death, there must be birth—this is the inevitable principle of Heaven and Earth. Those who cannot escape the afflictions of these thirteen stages do so because the desire for life among the myriad things never ceases. Having deeply attached themselves to existence, how can they avoid death?

The Venerable Lord, fearing that the world would not understand the principle of emerging into life and entering into death, posed the question: "Why is this so?" He then answered himself: "Because their pursuit of the Way of life is too fervent, and they cannot reach the realm beyond death, thus remaining bound to the thirteen stages of birth and death." If one wishes to no longer associate with these stages, one must step beyond the cycles of the Five Phases and the bounds of life and death.

The sūtra states: Those who skillfully nurture life walk on land without avoiding rhinoceroses or tigers; they enter battle without shunning armor or weapons. The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and weapons no place to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they dwell in no realm of death.

The exposition states: Since one is deeply devoted to the preservation of life, one should master the arts of nurturing and safeguarding life, follow the natural cycles of vitality, flourishing, decline, and decay, and comprehend the mechanism of emerging into life and entering into death. Cultivate the body, nourish the qi, secure the essence, preserve the spirit, diminish worldly cleverness, and cast aside cravings and desires. Thus, the seven emotions will not stir within, nor will the six sensory realms disturb without. One does not rush about in the arena of fame and profit—hence, when traveling on land, one does not avoid rhinoceroses or tigers. One does not enter perilous states nor dwell in chaotic realms; one does not indulge bodily desires nor invite misfortune—thus, when entering battle, one does not shun armor or weapons. Therefore, those who skillfully nurture life must purify the mind and conceal its depths, forgetting both things and form. This ensures that the rhinoceroses and tigers of the six desires find no place to thrust their horns or set their claws, and the blades of the three poisons have no ground to lodge their edges. When both spirit and form attain subtlety and merge with the Dao in truth, it is said there is no realm of death.

It is further said: The sage can transcend the physical form and does not consort with the thirteen stages, so external things cannot harm them, nor can the world bring them affliction. Laozi said: "My greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would there be?" Precisely because one has no attachment to the body can one dwell in no realm of death. Various schools interpret the thirteen stages differently—some as the nine orifices and four limbs, the seven emotions and six desires, others as the six waters and seven fires, or the six senses, four great elements, and three poisons—yet these do not align with the purport of the scripture. Here, this is specifically explicated to illuminate the path for later learners. It is like an infant who has not yet learned to smile...

The infant is one who has not yet emerged from the womb. Emerging from the womb is called "child." While in the mother’s belly, the infant embraces only a single mass of harmonious *qi*. The emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen; the faculties of perception, hearing, knowing, and awareness have not yet sprouted. Upon leaving the mother’s womb, these emotions and faculties awaken—thus, they are no longer fit to serve as metaphors for the Dao.

The ancients spoke of "nurturing the pearl of the child" and "preserving the great harmony." They also spoke of the "sacred embryo," the "embryo of the Dao," "embryonic breathing," and "embryonic immortality"—never once did they speak of emerging from the womb. Among the cultivation methods of the Three Teachings’ sages and worthies, none surpass this. Laozi embraced the origin and guarded the One, concentrating *qi* to attain suppleness. The quietude of Śākyamuni and Yanzi’s "sitting in forgetfulness" are but the state of the infant.

Within the Two Poles, the "Non-Pole" is the center within the centerless, while the "Great Pole" is the ultimate center. Motionless and quiescent, it is the primordial *qi* that governs all creatures. It cannot be described in form, for it knows no bias, no excess, no deficiency—it is the inception of the *qi* of Qian, the root of the myriad things. Though the names of the poles differ, their center remains the same. The Three Powers and the ten thousand things cannot depart from this center even for an instant. As for the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this center—in Confucianism, is called "refining essence and unifying"; it is also called "preserving spirit." In Daoism, it is called "embracing the origin" or "guarding the One." In Buddhism, it is called "dhyāna" or "quiescent contemplation." All are the inherent center of the human heart.

When one’s inherent center aligns with the natural center of the Two Poles, heaven, earth, things, and self become one body. Once things and self share the same origin, and the center is quiescent, there is no arising or ceasing, no flowing or stagnation, no coming or going, no bias or deviation. Thus, one may equalize the myriad things, unify life and death, and stand in the ultimate center.

**On Sitting in Forgetfulness**
"Sitting" means halting movement; "forgetting" means stilling thoughts. Without sitting, one cannot cease activity; without forgetting, one cannot quiet contemplation. If activity does not cease, the spirit cannot be tranquil. If thoughts do not still, the heart cannot be at peace. Without halting bodily action and quieting mental activity, this Dao cannot be attained.

Thus, the ancients established the two methods of *zhi* (cessation) and *guan* (contemplation) to remedy the illnesses of distraction and dullness. *Zhi* halts distraction, returning it to samādhi. *Guan* observes dullness, restoring it to wisdom. Without the power of samādhi, one cannot halt distraction; without introspection, one cannot illuminate dullness. The superior practitioners of old all sought the Dao through this path. Thus, Yan Hui relaxed his limbs, subdued his brilliance, departed from form, and abandoned knowledge to await the great penetration. Ziqin leaned on his armrest and sat, losing his sense of self. Mingdao sat as still as a clay statue. Master Xu said: "Abide in quiescent concentration, free from stray thoughts." Guangchengzi said: "See not, hear not—embrace the spirit in stillness." The Queen Mother of the West said: "Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence." On Spirit Mountain for six years, in Shaoshi for nine—some never rested their ribs on the mat, never rose from their seat, their bodies and minds unmoving, entering the great quiescence. In the Buddhist tradition, such examples are countless, yet all involve halting distraction and illuminating dullness.

Without the cultivation of sitting, how can the sacred embryo be perfected? Only when the great matter of samādhi and wisdom is clarified can one roam freely at will. If the matter remains unclear, sitting should not be abandoned. Yet mere dull sitting, like a block of wood, is called the "ghostly cave of black mountains"—outward stillness concealing inner agitation, termed "sitting in distraction." This is not what is meant by sitting in forgetfulness.

**On Subduing the Heart-Mind**
The human heart-mind is most cunning and perilous, easily swayed. In an instant, it traverses the ten thousand things. Its greed is like that of tigers, wolves, eagles, and hawks; its venom like that of vipers, scorpions, and serpents. If unleashed, it gallops like ten thousand steeds in the wind; if indulged, it leaps like a troop of monkeys in the trees. Its weapons are like spears, swords, and halberds; its schemes like nets, hooks, and awls. It finds no satisfaction in a thousand measures of wealth and rank, no glory in dwelling in nine-tiered pavilions. The hearts of all things may be fathomed, but the human heart-mind cannot.

How, then, is it to be subdued? First, one must know contentment; then, apply restraint like poison. Curb its indulgence, rein in its dissipation. Disperse its weapons, cast aside its nets. Forget riches and honor, unify its scattered impulses. Quiet its thoughts, sever its attachments and resentments. Let joy, anger, sorrow, and delight lie dormant, unexpressed. Still the dreams of delusion, distance them in silence. Let the six desires not arise, the seven emotions not entangle. Let all worldly principles, affairs, and realms pass without clinging—like the moon resting on still water, clouds dispersing in the vast sky, effortless and natural, thus and unmoving.

Only then can it be subdued—like external enemies surrendering to the Middle Kingdom, like ministers submitting to their sovereign. Thereafter, danger and safety are secured, armor is cast aside, weapons laid down. The six desires do not arise, the three poisons vanish—this heart-mind is the great peace of the world.

**Inscription on the Right of Yangshan’s Meditation Chamber**
The dark clouds disperse...

Then prajñā—compassion saves all beings.
Deluded, it is ignorance; awakened, the moon of wisdom flows through empty space.
Compassion and loving-kindness,
throughout the twelve hours,
grieve for all beings.
In walking, standing, sitting, lying—all is thusness.
The heart-mind remains ever one,
fortifying against the multitude of desires.
Precepts restrain the hundred evils;
charity relieves the destitute.
The five aggregates dissolve,
almsgiving unfolds—
when the five skandhas are empty, one becomes a bodhisattva.
Vastly bestow hidden virtue;
when one’s nature is perfectly luminous, the heart-mind is the Buddha’s Way.
The Buddha is the heart-mind; when the heart-mind is settled, it is the Buddha.
The great mirror of wisdom—
turning inward to observe one’s own heart-mind,
when greed and attachment are extinguished,
truly, it does not depend on others.
Wisdom—
without greed, the ears and the rest are true emptiness.
Illuminating the benighted,
afflictions naturally vanish.
The Way is not far from humanity;
it is humanity that magnifies the Way, not the Way that magnifies humanity.
To magnify it lies within oneself.
Day and night, with diligence,
perceiving the dusts as pure—
with vigor,
when the six senses are purified, one is equal to the Tathāgata.
Good thoughts never recede;
the body, pure and exposed alone,
the heart-mind settled, scattering stilled—
samādhi.

Stillness and contemplation clarify the spirit—
in daily use, perception, awareness, seeing, hearing,
all are wondrous function.
To endure humiliation—
every step a conch’s whorl,
enduring humiliation, blessed virtue grows day by day.
Worldly toil does not obstruct;
blocked, vexation; unobstructed, bodhisattva.
When the nature of awakening manifests,
this very body and heart-mind are the Buddha-dharma—
cease seeking in external forms.
Illumination knows no past, no present.

The great, perfect, equanimous wisdom
is the original heart-mind.
The roots of precepts, concentration, and wisdom must be resolute;
greed, hatred, and afflictions cannot encroach.
The six dusts and five aggregates—all false shadows.
If one comprehends thus,
the great earth turns to gold.

This Dharma-gate alone is most direct;
clarifying the heart-mind, seeing one’s nature comes first.
The Tathāgata’s one great cause and condition.
Understanding the true meaning,
one is immediately a golden immortal.

Almsgiving, compassion, and enduring humiliation,
with unwavering precision, free from greed—ever thus.
Moving with impartial emotion, without bias.
If this heart-mind remains unobscured,
a lotus blooms in the fire of the twelfth month.

Perception, awareness, seeing, hearing—all wondrous function;
in dwelling, walking, sitting, lying—thusness.
Through the hundred moments of day and night, do not cling to emptiness.
If worldly passions are not grasped,
this is the very practice.

No self, no other, no abiding marks—
truly, profoundly reflecting the mysterious void.
Perfect clarity, complete, lacking nothing.
At the pole’s tip, advance [a step further]—
the midnight moon stands solitary.

*Inscription on the left of Yangshan’s cinnabar chamber*
Yin and yang pause in harmony.

Harmony without dissipation—this is ablution.
Regulating the breath, its fragrance gradually arises,
pervading the four limbs.
The nose’s *po* guards the lungs,
harmonizing the center in equilibrium.

"Subtle and continuous as if present"—this is the firing time.
All returns to non-thought.
Knowing the masculine, guarding the feminine,
*qi*—primal *qi*—ever abides.
Concealing radiance, obscuring brilliance,
gathering in the six senses.

The eyes—
the five *qi* returning to the origin—this is gathering the medicine.
The *hun* guards the liver.
All returns to non-thought.
Embracing yin, enfolding yang,
the Mysterious Female’s gate.

Holding truth, embracing the One,
halting thought, ceasing deliberation—
the body born of the womb is the cinnabar furnace.
The spirit—
the spleen—
all lies within this body.

The root of Heaven’s essence,
the primal spirit dwells of itself.
Intention guards the spleen,
refining mercury and lead.

The heart of daily use is the golden fan,
never departing from the square inch.

Silencing sound, stilling hearing,
gathering essence, *qi*, spirit—
the ears—
the Three Flowers binding their leaves—this is the elixir head.
Essence abides in the kidneys,
fusing into one expanse.

Knowing the white, guarding the black,
essence—primal essence—never scatters.
Within the twelve hours,
unceasing vigilance—this is the work.

Subduing flavors, restraining speech,
the heart ever remains as one.
The mouth—
the spirit guards the heart—
not a wisp of thought arises.
Round and without leakage—this is firm sealing.

Unperturbed, the numinous terrace:
take the heart as the mercury tripod,
[this body] as the lead furnace.
Mercury and lead—two flavors—bind the mysterious pearl,
a single grain vast as a millet seed.

The intent-steed gallops—mercury scatters;
the heart-ape stirs slightly—lead withers.
If one can surpass the thirteen disciples,
what concern are life and death to me?

*Hun* and *po*, spirit, intent, consciousness,
the colored body, fragrance, and flavor—all are disciples.
Unite them with a single *qi* to pierce the mysterious pearl,
gathering it into the Central Land’s realm.

The Mysterious Orchard—pure, serene, essence-clear;
the heart-field—leveled, its wasteland tilled.
The Great Elixir blazes, dazzling the crystal vase,
alone and resplendent—who is its companion?

Essence is the root of spirit’s birth;
*qi* is the root of life’s nurturance.
When the three are bound, they unite with Heaven and Earth.

The Dipper’s handle wheels through the celestial round—
at midnight it rises from the sea’s edge,
by noon it streams down Kunlun’s slopes.
Golden Crow and Jade Hare pause in their turning wheels,
illuminating at a glance the emptiness of the five aggregates.

The true Dao is not transmitted.
The arts of the world may be transmitted, but the Dao cannot.
Techniques may be spoken, but the Dao cannot be spoken.
Lao Jun said: “The Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao.
The name that can be named is not the enduring name.”
The Dao is originally without pattern—what words can speak it?
The Dao is originally empty and still—what thing can transmit it?
One must first realize it in the heart,
then use the master’s teachings to verify one’s awakening.
When words and deeds align, the master has guided me.
The master is a signpost.
If the multitude do not follow the Way, it is not the signpost’s fault.
The master can affirm right and wrong,
but cannot make others attain the Dao.

The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says:
“If one claims the Tathāgata liberates sentient beings,
then one clings to the marks of self, person, sentient being, and lifespan.”
The nature of sentient beings is originally complete and perfect;
I merely awaken them,
enabling them to understand the principle and liberate themselves.
If one claims, “I can liberate them,”
then one is attached to worldly names and forms.

Lao Jun also said:
“The true and constant Dao is realized by those who awaken to it.”
He never claimed to be able to liberate others.

Modern scholars chase the strange and admire the bizarre,
claiming this one can project spirit, that one can commune with sages,
some see hell, others roam heaven,
some say spirits converse with them, others dream of ghostly omens.
They delude people with fortune and misfortune,
deceive them with auspice and calamity.
Fasting is called “observing the night,”
drinking wine and eating meat “nurturing essence,”
hunching the back and drooping the head “sitting in the circle.”
Delusion is called “meditation,”
inversion is called “Buddhahood.”
Counting breaths is called “life,”
recognizing spirit is called “nature.”
There are even those who go naked, bare their bodies,
practice qi-ingestion, harvest yin and yang,
play with the primordial womb, indulge in filth and debauchery,
or engage in depravity—
calling what cannot be questioned “secret.”
They bow and kowtow, calling themselves disciples.
The list is endless.

Good teachers do not indulge the strange.
They meet such things without reverence,
speak of them without affection,
point out flaws and reject impurities,
publicly exposing and refuting them.
Alas! Is the world one that favors falsehood over truth?

What can be transmitted of the Dao is merely technique.
What can be grasped of the heart is also delusion.
Those who do not realize it within but seek it outside
do not attain the true Dao.
Thus it is said: techniques may be transmitted.

**On Uprightness and Domestication**

Humans are born—
their form must be upright.
Domesticated animals are born—
their form must be horizontal.
The upright resemble the form of Heaven and Earth.
The horizontal reverse the form of Heaven and Earth.
Those who resemble Heaven and Earth in form
follow the nature and disposition of Heaven and Earth.
Those who reverse the form of Heaven and Earth
serve the uses of human ways.

All creatures with feathers, scales, or shells
are horizontal in body.
Those horizontal in body are horizontal in nature.
Wolves, tigers, eagles, owls, vipers, pythons, and dragons—
these are the fierce, greedy, and wrathful kinds in the world.

Humans, however, stand with heads upright and feet square,
backs broad and bellies ample,
adorned with virtue and power,
girded with benevolence and righteousness,
thus honored above all creatures.
To stand upright in body is to stand upright in the Dao.
Thus they govern the heart with uprightness,
govern the people with uprightness,
serve the ruler with uprightness.
Among the Three Powers, the upright are sovereign.

In the word “three,” the upright stroke is paramount.
Confucius said: “Humans are born upright.”
All who stand upright in body and heart are human.
All who are horizontal in body and heart are beasts.
Few in the world do not make their bodies and hearts horizontal.

**On Grafting Trees**

There are countless trees with flowers and fruits,
yet their colors cannot delight the eye,
their flavors cannot please the mouth—
these are ordinary trees.
Yet even they may be transformed through grafting.

When the first buds sprout,
the skilled artisan prunes away the common shoots,
grafts on fine branches,
binds them with grass,
secures them with mud,
then lets the seasonal winds blow upon them,
and the nourishing rains moisten them.
New shoots then grow from the old stems.
What was once sour and bitter becomes sweet and fragrant.
Ordinary wood becomes extraordinary blossoms—
colors to delight the eye, flavors to please the mouth.
All rejoice in their beauty and savor their fruits.

From this we see: to say human nature cannot be changed is wrong.
When the first stirrings of thought arise,
prune away the evil impulses,
replace them with fine intentions,
shield them with the grass of patience,
secure them with the soil of trust,
let the harmonious winds blow upon them,
bathe them in the rains of wisdom.
Then good plans will grow,
evil thoughts will cease.
What was once perverse and obsequious becomes upright and just.
What was false and deceptive becomes sincere and trustworthy.
Wisdom’s flowers bloom,
true fruits ripen.
All admire their ability and praise their resolve.

To say nature cannot be changed,
evil cannot be turned—
are these not the words of beasts?

Observing grafting, I grasped the principle of cutting away evil and cultivating goodness,
thus I wrote *On Grafting Trees*.

**Diagram of the Three Bodies Sharing One Root**

The Dao divides into the functions of the three bodies.

The Principle Unites in the One True Origin: An Explanation of the Three Bodies Sharing One Root

The Dao gives birth to the One, the One pairs into Two, which is named Qian. Thus the Three Powers begin. The ancients established images necessarily embodying the primordial Qian.

The Dao has Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Great Clarity; Buddhism has the Dharma Body, the Reward Body, and the Transformation Body; Śākyamuni has Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra; Amitābha has Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. This is the meaning of the Supreme Ultimate containing the Three.

The Three are the primordial Qian. Qian corresponds to Metal, thus the Dao speaks of the Golden Elixir, the Golden Tripod, the Golden Duke. Buddhism speaks of the Vajra, the Golden Immortal, the Golden Form. All that is called "gold" symbolizes Qian.

Let us take one Buddha as an example—other principles may be inferred without being stated. Amitābha’s Avalokiteśvara wears white, while Mahāsthāmaprāpta wears blue-green. Blue-green is the color of the eastern dawn; white is the color of the West. Blue-green corresponds to Wood, symbolizing the image of compassionate teaching and nurturing sentient beings. White corresponds to Metal, symbolizing the image of wisdom and awakening sentient beings.

The Buddha stands at the center, hands empty and raised high and low, symbolizing virtue uniting with Heaven and Earth in non-action. The two attendants each hold something, symbolizing the meaning of transformative action. They stand upon lotus flowers, symbolizing purity and unstainedness. Their fingers necessarily hold to the center, symbolizing that holding to the center is the Dao. Their robes are necessarily pure red, symbolizing Yang. Their forms are necessarily firm as gold, symbolizing hardness. Their feet are necessarily bare, symbolizing departure from the dust.

The rest may be known without being spoken.

The body of the Dao is empty and quiescent, originally without form or color—seen but not visible, heard but not audible. Yet both Buddhism and Daoism show people these limited images. In principle, is this not mistaken?

Alas! The sages have grown distant, and the source and flow have diverged ever further.

Should images not be employed, how could later generations be guided toward what is to come? This was the ancients’ expedient, born of necessity. Truly, to behold a borrowed form and thereby contemplate the ancient Dao is one gateway to faith.

Yet while establishing images and instituting teachings inevitably involves artifice, the heart of the sage has never differed. The true essence lies beyond form, and thus is not easily spoken of. When unified, the ten thousand differences share a single root; when dispersed, the single root becomes ten thousand differences. In awakening, one body encompasses the Three; in delusion, the Three bodies remain divided.

The *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* speaks of the three minds that cannot be attained:
The past mind cannot be attained,
the present mind cannot be attained,
the future mind cannot be attained.

These three minds—when applied to what has gone before, they are the past; when applied to the present, they are the now; when applied to what comes after, they are the future. Or again: the thought just extinguished is the past, the thought now arising is the present, the thought yet to arise is the future. Though the times of the three realms differ, the principle underlying them remains unchanged.

The mind of the sage is eternally one. It does not age with the passing of high antiquity, nor does it grow weary in the present, nor vanish in the time to come. It is not altered by affairs or things, nor does it shift with past or present. Employed to govern the world, to teach and nurture all beings, and to harmonize with the four seasons—though it may manifest in emotion and take form in action—it never clings to anything.

Observe its beginning: still and unmoving.
Examine it now: vast and without action.
Gaze upon its end: boundless and without limit.

When it transforms the multitude of beings, none know its virtue. When it is applied to the world, none reward its merit. It does not seek fame in the past, form in the present, or dharma in the future. Thus it is said to be unattainable.

The Diagram of Six Correspondences
The Meaning of the Six Correspondences

Wisdom stands opposite ignorance: when awakened, ignorance becomes wisdom; when deluded, wisdom becomes ignorance. Buddha-nature stands opposite sentient beings: when deluded, Buddha-nature becomes sentient beings; when awakened, sentient beings become Buddha-nature. Afflictions stand opposite bodhi: when awakened, afflictions become bodhi; when deluded, bodhi becomes afflictions. Joy stands opposite anger: when awakened, anger becomes joy; when deluded, joy becomes anger. Self-interest stands opposite benevolence and righteousness: when awakened, self-interest becomes benevolence and righteousness; when deluded, benevolence and righteousness become self-interest. Delusion stands opposite truth: when awakened, delusion becomes truth; when deluded, truth becomes delusion.

The meanings of all these pairings above are rooted in mutual transformation—body and function interchange, beginning and end alternate. From the utmost sagely to the utmost foolish, none are without this shared essence. These six pairings are like water and boiling water: fundamentally the same yet functionally distinct. When boiling water cools, it returns to water; when water heats, it becomes boiling water again. The two interpenetrate, indistinguishable, differing only in cold and heat.

Now, boiling water is but water transformed—just as ignorance is but the presence of wisdom. Now, water is but boiling water transformed—just as Buddha-nature is but the presence of sentient beings. Boiling water does not depart from water, nor water from boiling water—just as the six pairings do not depart from their opposites. Thus, when ignorance arises, wisdom is extinguished; when sentient beings are deluded, Buddha-nature is extinguished; when delusion arises, truth is extinguished; when anger arises, joy is extinguished; when afflictions arise, bodhi is extinguished; when self-interest arises, benevolence and righteousness are extinguished. It is like when boiling water arises, the nature of water is extinguished, and when water arises, the nature of boiling water is extinguished. Though they mutually give rise to and extinguish one another, their fundamental nature was never different.

Anger and joy are not two separate natures—anger does not depart so that joy may arise again. The two are but a single principle. It is like a single rod: one end is anger, the other joy—used as one’s hand turns it. Just as water, when heated, becomes boiling water, and boiling water, when cooled, returns to water, so too are the six pairings of the same principle. To seek Buddha-nature apart from sentient beings, to seek wisdom apart from ignorance, to seek bodhi apart from afflictions—this is fundamentally impossible.

**On the Golden Elixir and Nature-Life**

Someone asked about the categories of the Golden Elixir and nature-life.

Question: The alchemical classics abound with metaphors—thousands of chapters and ten thousand discourses. As a beginner, I cannot fathom their direct meaning. I beg for a single word of instruction.

Answer: When the five qi are not errant, the five emotions do not arise, the five flavors are not coveted, desires do not taint, the six roots are purified, and the square inch of the heart is limpid and clear—this is the true elixir. This method is the most direct.

Question: What is the method for refining the two true elixirs?

Answer: Cut off worldly affairs, sit in silent meditation, subdue the Azure Dragon, tame the White Tiger, extinguish the Vermilion Bird, still the Dark Warrior, guard the Curved Array, keep the five weapons unused, and pacify the eight directions—such is the elixir method.

Question: Is this something everyone can achieve?

Answer: Though it is so, one must first reach this state to call it "readily available." Without attaining this essential point, one cannot speak of it as "readily available."

Question: Are true lead, true mercury, true water, and true fire actual substances, or are they metaphors among ten thousand words?

Answer: The Dao is not sought from without; seeking it externally is not the great Dao. True lead and mercury are the root and origin of heaven and earth. True water and fire are the fundamental ancestors of yin and yang. Mercury and lead within humans are nature and life; water and fire within humans are spirit and qi—not actual substances in the world. The ancients did not wish to reveal it directly, so they spoke of it in ten thousand words through things, guiding people to seek afar and near, to match the yin and yang beyond forms with the spirit and qi within the body. Apart from one’s original destiny and primordial spirit, all else—crucibles, vessels, medicines, dragons, tigers, tortoises, snakes, and all things with form in the world—are but metaphors.

Question: It is said that one sets up altars and oratories, establishes furnaces and crucibles, models the patterns of yin and yang, refines worldly medicines, and upon completion of the elixir, consumes it to ascend and attain longevity. Is this true or not?

Answer: In the Returning Elixir, the body is the furnace, the heart is the crucible, non-thought is the method, gathering emptiness is the medicine, refining it with the fire of spirit, tempering it with the water of nature, and merging them in an instant—this is the wonder of ingestion. Persisting thus over time, one firmly attains immortality. Refining worldly, common medicines wastes wealth and exhausts strength. Many emperors and heroes of past ages were deceived by alchemists—ten thousand times none succeeded.

Question: Yet in famous mountains and grottoes, there remain furnaces and crucibles for elixirs. Were the ancients all mistaken?

Answer: The perfected ones established furnaces and crucibles externally to refine common medicines and internally to refine the elixir of the heart. They followed the hours of day and night, practicing civil and martial methods, adding and withdrawing, borrowing the work of the external furnace to regulate the movements of the inner heart. If the inner heart does not slacken, the external fire does not err; if the inner heart slackens, the external work is lost. Externally, they guarded the furnace and crucible; internally, they circulated Kan and Li. When the inner elixir was achieved, the external medicine also formed—consuming it, how could one not ascend?

Today, people know only how to refine external medicines but do not understand the inner elixir. The six roots are not purified, the three poisons are not extinguished, concentration and wisdom do not arise, deluded thoughts are not eliminated, Kan and Li do not merge, mercury and lead do not congeal. Even with external medicine, the immortal path remains but a dream.

Question: Having understood the medicine, one must clarify the firing process. How does the medicine congeal? How is the firing process applied?

Answer: When essence, qi, and spirit interact, and the heart, intent, and consciousness are unmoving—this is the congealing of the elixir. The silent circulation of Kan and Li through the twelve hours, without stray thoughts—this is the firing process. If one does not apply effort at the proper time, the firing process is lost. If one’s spirit and qi are agitated at the proper time, the great medicine is without effect.

Should one know the medicine yet remain ignorant of the firing process, all effort is in vain.

**Question:** In the practice of refinement, must one follow the seasonal nodes, align with the hexagrams’ qi, and adhere to the hours?
**Answer:** True fire has no fixed timing; the great medicine has no set method. The ancients established seasonal nodes and hexagram qi merely to clarify yin and yang, recognize their images and numbers, and verify the hours—so that one might then act accordingly, ensuring that this essence, this qi, this spirit, this heart align with the celestial mechanism, correspond to the hexagram images, and do not contradict them. If the celestial Way’s timing is lost, yin and yang fall into disorder, and wind and rain lose their season. If the human heart stirs recklessly at the proper hour, the firing process is lost, and the elixir path remains unfulfilled. One must align moment by moment with the workings of creation, harmonizing the Five Phases. Thus, hexagrams and hours are established as a standard for the human heart.

**Question:** May I hear of the civil and martial firing methods—advancing and withdrawing the fire?
**Answer:** The firing process is most wondrous, a secret not transmitted even by a thousand sages. Speaking roughly, it is nothing more than harmonizing metal and fire. Metal is lead; fire is mercury. Lead is the dark; mercury is spirit. Spirit is nature; qi is life. When nature and life merge, metal and fire blend their radiance, and the elixir path is achieved. If the fire is too martial, it scorches; if too civil, it overflows. The key is neither to scorch with martial fire nor to overflow with civil fire. When behind, withdraw; when ahead, add. At the beginning, advance; at the end, retreat. Maintain it as if ceaselessly present, warm and balanced. It is like tuning a zither: if the strings are too tight, they snap; if too loose, they do not sound. Neither tight nor loose, they respond to the touch and produce music. The firing process is no different.

**Question:** After the ten-month gestation of the sacred embryo, should one continue to apply fire?
**Answer:** It is like smelting gold ore: once refined into gold, it is not returned to the ore. Firm, luminous, and pure, its nature does not change—this is called the indestructible vajra body. At this stage, one rests in great stillness. Though no fire is added, neither is it withdrawn. Abiding in silent radiance, ceaselessly present yet effortless in application—like a fish drinking water, one knows its warmth or coolness for oneself.

**Question:** Is the completion of the sacred embryo the final attainment?
**Answer:** When the embryo is perfected in ten months, it is like forging a single whole. To reach final attainment, one must shatter that whole, ascend into formlessness, and depart from all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao.

**Question:** The *Cantong Qi* of Boyang and the *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* were composed in accordance with the *Book of Changes*, their language archaic and meaning profound, making their ultimate purport difficult to fathom. Are there simpler teachings beyond these?
**Answer:** The immortals feared that if the world obtained the Way too easily, they would lose it just as easily. Thus, they borrowed the images of the *Changes* to elucidate it. Humans, shaped in the likeness of heaven and earth, follow the Way of heaven and earth. If one understands the *Changes*, then the Way of heaven and earth resides in one’s heart. The simplest of all is nature and life. Nature is the true non-being of the Supreme Ultimate; life is the wondrous being of the Ultimateless. The Confucians’ five carts of texts, the Buddhists’ three treasuries, and the hundreds of thousands of alchemical scriptures cannot surpass this.

**Question:** Beyond nature and life, is there a further mystery?
**Answer:** The heart. The heart is the palace of spirit, the lord of essence, the commander of qi. When the heart is still, spirit abides; when the heart is unified, essence is unified; when the heart is settled, qi is settled. When the heart stirs, a hundred thoughts arise; when the heart is still, ten thousand conditions cease. In its vastness, it fills the Two Modes; in its contraction, it harmonizes the Four Images. It gathers the Five Phases, unites the Eight Trigrams, fuses lead and mercury, water and fire, and returns spirit, essence, hun, and po to tranquility. Whether becoming an immortal, a buddha, a master, or a scholar, all is accomplished through the heart.

**Question:** In the Way of the Golden Elixir, which comes first—nature or life?
**Answer:** Those who enter through the school of nature make nature primary and life responsive. Those who enter through the school of life make life primary and nature responsive. Nature cannot exist without life—without life, it is mere dry wisdom. Life cannot exist without nature—without nature, it is withered yang. These two emerge together yet differ in function; one cannot cling to just one.

**Question:** Humans take form, qi, spirit, nature, and life as their foundation. Where do they ultimately begin and end?
**Answer:** The Supreme Ultimate blends into qi; the singularity of qi is called essence; the wondrous aspect of essence is called spirit; the wondrous aspect of spirit is called nature. When qi descends into humans, it becomes life. In humans, qi governs form. When qi is sufficient, essence is sufficient; when essence is sufficient, spirit is luminous; when spirit is luminous, nature reaches its apex. Nature is the beginning; life is the end. The ultimate lies therein.

**Question:** If one can embrace the origin and guard the One, the rest—hexagrams, yin and yang—are merely metaphors. Why trouble oneself with abstruse studies, needlessly burdening the mind?
**Answer:** The Way of the immortals is not for those of dull perception. If one does not clearly understand the beginning of the Supreme Ultimate and the root of heaven and earth, and does not recognize hexagram images, qi numbers, Kan and Li, lead and mercury, one is not a master of principle. If one merely embraces the origin without change or guards the One without comprehension, remaining ignorant of the Dao’s whereabouts, how can this be called the wondrous mystery? The Way of the immortals is not for the obstinate or the unlearned.

**Question:** The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Is the Mysterious Female not a physical entity?
**Answer:** The Mysterious Female is the ancestor of the primordial Dao. The Three Powers and the myriad things are born from it; the myriad principles and ten thousand methods return to it. In things, it is nature and life; in medicine, it is lead and mercury; in humans, it is spirit and essence; in hexagrams, it is Kan and Li; in the *Changes*, it is the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, it is the original nature; in Daoism, it is the Mysterious Pass. This single aperture encompasses wondrous principles and subtle workings beyond words. One who attains it may share the years of heaven and earth.

The Mysterious Female is not a thing of form or substance.

**Question:** If the refinement of elixirs and ingestion of medicinal substances cannot be relied upon, then what *can* be relied upon?
**Answer:** Lead is one’s own lead; mercury is one’s own mercury; essence is one’s own essence; spirit is one’s own spirit; the crucible and vessel are one’s own; the medicinal ingredients are one’s own; dragon and tiger are one’s own; Kan and Li correspond to one’s own system. All these metaphors refer to what one already possesses and employs—only then can they align with the Great Elixir. Seeking cinnabar in the world while abandoning the treasures within one’s own home is like trying to steam sand into rice or grasp leaves as gold—merely a waste of spirit.

**Question:** Pengzu said:
*"To dismiss one’s wife is to vainly sever yin and yang;
To cease eating is but to empty the bowels and stomach."*
Does this mean that the Golden Elixir need not obstruct one’s family life, diet, fame, or profit?
**Answer:** Immortals observe that worldly people assume abandoning one’s wife and fasting alone constitute the Great Way, without ever seeking their own original life and primordial spirit. If one can remain in the world without being of it, dwell in dust without being stained by it, then there is no need to forsake gratitude and righteousness, abandon food, or leave one’s spouse—no need to stand apart in eccentric isolation to cultivate the Dao. But those who cling to the words of ancients, believing that the pursuit of immortality does not hinder family, diet, fame, or profit, are destined for hell.

**Question:** The ancients required an encounter with a master to attain the Dao—were there any who succeeded without one?
**Answer:** Before awakening, one must meet a teacher; after awakening, one becomes one’s own heart-master. As Zhuangzi said: *"If the Dao could be given to others, none would fail to pass it to their descendants."* In general, one must awaken through one’s own heart. Seeking externally from others is but a futile endeavor.

*End of Scroll Two of* **Direct Pointers to the Mysteries of the Dao: All Methods Return to the Same Source**

*Scroll Three of* **Direct Pointers to the Mysteries of the Dao: All Methods Return to the Same Source**
*Composed by Mu Changchao of Yangshan Daoist Abbey, Jian’an*
*Compiled by Disciple Yishan Huang Benren*

Should one inquire about the elixir of gold, essence, and life—

**Question:** Is it permissible in principle to proceed without a master’s transmission?
**Answer:** Those who awaken without a teacher are not unknown in the world. As Zhuangzi said: *"Follow the sincerity of your heart and take it as your teacher—who alone is without one?"* The Buddha declared: *"In past lives, I had countless teachers. Now, by the natural radiance of my spirit, I attain the Dao—this is to be without a teacher."* Yet it is not that there is no teacher; rather, seeking from others is not as reliable as seeking from oneself. If the lineage is impure, one may instead be led into confusion—how easily does one meet a true master?

**Question:** The ingredients are easy to recognize, but the firing times are most difficult. How should one practice to get it right?
**Answer:** From ancient times to the present, no elixir manual has spoken of the initial work of firing times. Only the illustrated diagrams of the Perfected Zhang and Bai Yuchan reveal it with utmost clarity. The *Lotus Sutra* calls it *"the one great causal condition"*—it is no small matter. One must awaken to it with perfect clarity, so that in all twelve hours, whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, one remains like an infant cradled in the arms. Spirit and qi harmonize; Kan and Li circulate in secret. Inner visions do not arise; external thoughts do not stir. If thoughts move, the fire scatters; if notions arise, the timing is lost. Warm as the sun in a cold land, bright as the full moon in autumn’s sky. Like a hen brooding her eggs, like a young dragon nurturing its pearl. As in the primal chaos of the Two Modes, as at the beginning of the undifferentiated qi. The Confucians speak of *"joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure before they arise"*; the Buddhists speak of *"emptiness of sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness."* If one refines in this way, the elixir path may be accomplished; otherwise, I know not what will become of it.

**Question:** What are the two arcs?
**Answer:** The human body naturally possesses two arcs. Speaking in terms of the celestial Dao: at the new moon, Kun begins as *Fu*, resembling the moon’s first crescent. By the eighth day, Kun transforms into *Lin*, resembling the first quarter. On the fifteenth, Kun becomes *Tai*, resembling the full moon. On the sixteenth, Qian begins as *Gou*, resembling the moon’s waning. By the twenty-third, Qian transforms into *Dun*, resembling the last quarter. On the thirtieth day, Qian is exhausted and transforms into Kun, resembling the dark moon. From this point onward, Kun again gives rise to Zhen; darkness again gives birth to brightness. Thus it cycles endlessly, without cease. From the eighth to the twenty-third day, exactly sixteen days pass—this is called *"one catty."* Yin and yang are evenly balanced, hence the term *"two arcs."* The elixir path takes its model from this, serving as the standard for the inner symbolism of the human body.

**Question:** May we hear of the inner symbolism of the two arcs?
**Answer:** Half a catty of gold, half a catty of silver—upper and lower unite in harmony, like the full moon. If even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir path will not succeed. This Dao is profound and wondrous; it cannot be transmitted except by the heart.

**Question:** What are the two solstices?
**Answer:** To speak of what is near: the day has its two solstices, the hour has its two solstices, the moment has its two solstices. Kan and Li, midnight and noon—these interactions never leave our bodies, so one need not seek the winter and summer solstices.

**Question:** Are the heart and the intent one thing or two?
**Answer:** The heart is awareness; intent is that which follows. The heart is aware and knows; thought follows accordingly. The heart’s mechanism operates through intent; intent is bound to the heart. The two cannot be separated. The spleen governs intent; intent delights in sound, hence the character for *"sound"* (音) is placed under *"heart"* (心) to form *"intent"* (意). The spleen belongs to earth; the spleen delights in thought, hence the character for *"field"* (田) is added to *"heart"* (心) to form *"thought"* (思). All terms such as intent, thought, will, reflection, gratitude, and resentment—those derived from the heart—are written with the *"heart"* radical. Thus we know that intent depends on the heart as its master. Hence it is said: *"All things are created by the heart alone."*

**Question:** May we hear of the wondrous harmony of the five spirits?
**Answer:** The hun emerges from the liver and corresponds to the eyes. The po emerges from the lungs and corresponds to the nose. Essence emerges from the kidneys and corresponds to the ears. Spirit emerges from the heart and corresponds to the tongue. Intent emerges from the spleen and corresponds to the four limbs. The heart’s spirit, hun, and po—through their seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—enable the eye’s root to discern colors, the ear’s root to hear sounds, the nose’s root to detect fragrances, and the tongue’s root to know tastes. Without intent, these four could not exercise their functions. Thus, if intent does not think, the hun does not rise; if intent does not ponder, essence does not move; if intent does not imagine, the po does not scatter; if intent does not conceive, the spirit does not waver. Internally, spirit, essence, hun, and po gather in intent; externally, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue submit to the spleen. In symbolism, metal, wood, water, and fire harmonize with earth. Governing the five qi and blending the hundred spirits—all depend on the spleen’s intent. As the ancients said: *"When not a single thought arises, the entire body is revealed; when the six roots stir, clouds obscure it."* This is also the subtlety of elixir refinement.

**Question:** What are the similarities and differences between nature, spirit, and heart?
**Answer:** Nature is the true emptiness that is utterly still. Spirit is the wondrous, numinous presence within true emptiness. It is through spirit that nature responds and communicates. The heart is the pivot of nature and the mechanism of spirit. When the pivot and mechanism are still, nature and spirit are at peace; when they move, nature and spirit waver. Though they have two functions, they do not depart from one body. Nature does not illuminate itself—spirit illuminates it. Nature does not communicate itself—spirit communicates it. To pacify nature and preserve spirit is the work of the heart. All methods arise from the heart.

**Question:** What is wisdom?
**Answer:** Wisdom is not of the human heart; it cannot be possessed. Wisdom is Kan; insight is Li. Water governs wisdom, flowing without cease. Fire governs insight, shining without cease. Wisdom-water and insight-fire circulate endlessly, and in all things, they are impartial. Wisdom is all-pervading; insight is all-illuminating. To be penetrating and illuminating is called wisdom. In Buddhism, it is wisdom; in Daoism, it is spirit and essence. To awaken to it is to embody the great void; to be deluded by it is to grope in the darkest night.

All beings, whether ordinary or enlightened, share the same essence—only awakening separates them.

**Question:** What of fasting?
**Answer:** The ancients, with their spirit, qi, and essence complete, practiced long and naturally ceased to eat without needing to fast. People today, not grasping the principle, forcibly abstain for five or seven days, mistaking starvation for discipline. They grow gaunt, their faces grimy, their essence withered, their hearts weak and trembling—yet they deem this the Way. They torment themselves in ascetic practice, hoping for blissful reward. How foolish!

**Question:** Some claim that supplementing essence and strengthening yang through diet forms the foundation of the elixir. Is this correct?
**Answer:** Humans rely on food to live, but enough to sustain the body suffices. To indulge the palate, nourishing the Three Corpses and feeding the Five Ghosts, is a method that harms the spirit and depletes qi—how can it be the path to longevity? Without abstinence and precepts, how can one be called pure? No sage or immortal ever spoke of drunkenness and gluttony as the way to transcendence.

**Question:** Those in the world who lack understanding merely seek to preserve their form and avoid death. If one’s practice does not reach this goal, what then?
**Answer:** This question is like a lotus in snow—rare in ancient or modern times. Most who study the Dao only learn to preserve their form and gather qi, treasuring their bodily shell in hopes of longevity, unaware that the great matter of life and death looms. When the final hour arrives, they scramble in panic, rushing toward the six destinies. As the scripture says: "The ghostly path is ever perilous." Seekers must thoroughly investigate the final step—do not treat it lightly.

**Question:** The great matter of life and death—pray, enlighten me on this final step.
**Answer:** Humans receive their bodies from their parents, modeled after heaven and earth, sustained by the five qi, and established through myriad conditions. From head to toe, all is impermanent. Thus, Maitreya’s verse says: "Though you endure for eighty thousand kalpas, in the end, you fall into emptiness." Only the primordial beginning of the Great Void, the original yang, remains unscathed even when the kalpa-fire rages. All else is borrowed—how can it not die? Laozi said: "My greatest affliction is that I have a body." And again: "The sage sets the body aside, yet the body endures." Thus, this body is ultimately an affliction; only the Dao can exist alone. The ancients practiced the Dao, not for the body. If one can embody the unborn and undying, attain the stillness of cessation, and reach the state beyond death and birth—what concern remains for the final step?

**Question:** All things are impermanent—this is an unchanging truth across past and present. Is there truly a path beyond death?
**Answer:** The ancients said:
*There is a thing before heaven and earth,
Its form originally still and vast.
It masters the ten thousand images,
Unchanging through the four seasons’ decay.*
Laozi spoke of the "valley spirit that does not die"—this is it. Things are impermanent, but our Dao alone endures. Things cannot escape death, yet we alone do not die. Is this not the path beyond death?

**Question:** The Buddhists focus entirely on the final step, even to the point of sacrificing their bodies for the Dao or giving their lives to benefit beings. Why?
**Answer:** The Buddhists see that before heaven and earth took form, the ten thousand things had no names or appearances. What we call names and appearances now are merely illusory combinations arising from conditions, mistaken for true principle. If one awakens to true principle, this body and life are seen as impermanent, destined to vanish—cast them aside like rotting wood. The wish is only to benefit all beings; the Dao is practiced, not the body. Thus, they exhaust life to its end, for this one matter is crucial at the moment of death.

**Question:** By your reasoning, then, the path to longevity is unnecessary?
**Answer:** The unborn and undying are the true heart of heaven and earth. Many sages of antiquity attained this. To deny it is to slander the Dao; to affirm it is to find it rare. I fear that people cannot avoid death, so I urge early awakening to the final step—lest at the last moment they enter another womb. I do not dare say it does not exist, only that beings seldom attain it.

**Question:** If one does not know tomorrow’s life today, how can one know death?
**Answer:** The tradition says: "Only the sage knows existence and extinction." The principle of life and death is not something ordinary people can grasp. But if you understand your origin, you understand your return. If you understand birth, you understand death. Yin and yang share a single principle; life and death are one path. Without realizing this essential point, how can one speak of the Dao?

**Question:** After the four great elements dissolve, where does this final step ultimately rest?
**Answer:** Few past masters have discussed this. When the illusory body’s four great elements dissolve, the four great elements of true emptiness endure forever. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: "Originally pure and all-pervading, it fills the dharma-realm." A moment’s delusion at the final hour, and one creates the causes of rebirth, falling once more into a womb. This final step is truly inconceivable—difficult to fathom.

**Question:** Does the true emptiness of the four great elements possess awareness?
**Answer:** It cannot be seen by sight or heard by sound. Wondrous! The Three Caverns echo in emptiness—how resonant! Yet it is said: "If there is sound and resonance, how can it be called true emptiness?"
**Answer:** Foolish as wood and stone! How can you speak of the Dao without grasping the sage’s subtlety?

**Question:** You first practiced Chan, then later studied immortality. May I ask whom you studied under, and might I hear of your circumstances?
**Answer:** In my youth, I saw Master Zihu weep over a dog, then return to his quarters and close the door. There, I awakened to the nature school. Later, in *The Awakening to Reality*, I grasped the meaning of the "millet pearl" and awakened to the life school. After twenty-odd years of war, though I endured hardships, I never neglected my practice. Once, on the road, I encountered a perfected one who transmitted the marvel of the firing times. Following it, I achieved verification within the expected time.

Alas! The world lacks true discernment and cannot together propagate the great Dao—how lamentable!

**Question:** The Complete Reality Teaching greatly resembles Buddhism. Why is this?
**Answer:** The emptiness and spontaneity of Laozi’s *Dao*, its non-action and purity, are not unlike those of Buddhism. The arts of preserving form and nurturing life were but a reluctant concession by the sages—a secondary gate pressed open to guide those of gradual cultivation. The supreme vehicle flows in a single current; who but the sages could partake of it? The Complete Reality path is one of sudden cultivation, hence its resemblance to Buddhism.

**Question:** What is meant by *sudden cultivation*?
**Answer:** *Sudden* means *directly through*. Without traversing side-paths, without entering the gate of the fence, one seizes the supreme vehicle—this is the way of the golden immortals. To proceed by path to gate, by gate to hall, by hall to chamber: this is called *gradual*. As the *Classic of Purity* says, “Gradually enter the true Dao.”

**Question:** Among ascension, immortality, and postmortem liberation, which is superior?
**Answer:** When spirit and form are both perfected, one may ascend; when spirit is preserved and *qi* nurtured, one may achieve immortality; when form perishes but spirit remains, one may attain postmortem liberation. Ascension and immortality are not of this world, yet those who sit in death and leave their bodies behind—how can any age lack them? Superiority or inferiority lies in what one verifies; it cannot lightly be debated.

**Question:** Is every case of postmortem liberation necessarily the Dao?
**Answer:** Those who sit in death or stand in release must have cultivated and verified in life. Their conduct aligns within, their words manifest without. If they truly know the root of the great Dao, then at the moment of departure, with wind clear and moon bright, it may be called the Dao. But if their understanding of the mysterious principle is shallow, and they leave no words for the world, merely sitting in transformation like ordinary folk—what is extraordinary about that?

**Question:** Why did Śākyamuni lie on his right side to enter *nirvāṇa*?
**Answer:** *Nir* means quiescence and non-arising; *vāṇa* means eternal life and non-death. To reach the realm of neither arising nor ceasing—this is called the Dao. His lying on the right side and being encoffined with solemnity were to demonstrate conformity with worldly law, not differing from the multitude, so as to set an example for later generations and prevent reckless displays of the strange. When a person of the Dao departs, what need is there for any particular posture?

**Question:** All scriptures say the Dao is not apart from the body, yet they also say that tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and the four great elements constituting the body are all yin—hence subject to aging and death. Then where is the Dao to be found?
**Answer:** Before father and mother were born, this body did not exist. Once form arose, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mind, spirit, *hun*, *po*, intent, old age, sickness, death, suffering, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness gathered and were named “one body”; divided, they were called the “four great elements.” Borrowed and conjoined, they are named “human”—hence they are called *yin*. Only the original true nature, that single spark of primordial yang, is called the Valley Spirit or the Mysterious Female. Within our body, this is the Dao—this is what achieves eternal life and non-death.

**Question:** If so, can form be discarded and not taken up, and the Dao exist apart from the body?
**Answer:** The body is the root, the mind the sovereign. Without the root, life has no foundation; without the sovereign, the Dao has no home. Only with body and mind can this Dao be realized. Without understanding the interplay of movement and stillness, without recognizing the master’s presence or absence, stubbornly clinging to the form of this born body—whether you discard it or cherish it, neither brings benefit. This Dao is not outside the body, nor within it; to separate from it is false, to grasp it is delusion. One must awaken to the point where spirit and form are both perfected—only then can the body be transcended while the body remains.

**Question:** Can one attain the Dao without employing Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, dragon and tiger, tortoise and snake, the crucible and furnace, firing times, lead and mercury, cinnabar and the like—without all these images?
**Answer:** To ask this is, in the Daoist tradition, to speak of the Primordial Beginning of Floating Blackness; in Buddhism, of the Tathāgata of Empty Sovereignty; in Confucianism, of the Supreme Ultimate of the Prior Heaven. This Dao is inherently complete, requiring no cultivation. Whoever suddenly awakens to it finds that all the world’s scriptures, expedient metaphors, forms, sounds, and images—even the mechanisms of dragon and tiger, tortoise and snake—are no longer needed. To enter this Dao is called the supreme vehicle. If one has not yet done so, one must carve and chisel the undifferentiated, distinguish lead and mercury, exhaust principle and fulfill nature, return to the root and restore life, truly recognize the rootless—only then may one embody the realms of the Primordial Beginning, the Empty Sovereign, and the Supreme Ultimate. Those who do not follow models but directly verify it are said to awaken suddenly. Those who verify it through instruments and images are said to practice gradual learning. Though there may be differences in speed, their destination is one.

**Question:** In the age of high antiquity, when writing had not yet arisen and the Three Teachings had not yet spread, by what did people learn the Dao?
**Answer:** In the earliest times, people did not distinguish between sage and fool, wise and worthy; they did not know benevolence, righteousness, the Dao, or virtue; they had no grasp of the marvelous, the skillful, writing, numbers, or calculation. Human hearts were simple and honest, making the Dao easy to attain. But when Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor established the Dao, when Yao and Shun instituted laws, when the Three Teachings stood in parallel and the Hundred Schools flowed forth, people galloped in the arena of letters, pursued the debates of right and wrong, clung to texts and principles, and craft and pretense followed one after another. Thus, the more learners there were, the fewer succeeded. For this reason, the Great Master Bodhidharma transmitted the teaching from the West: “No reliance on written words, a special transmission outside the teachings, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing nature and becoming Buddha”—this set a standard for China, embodying the intent of high antiquity’s wordless age. If one can suddenly awaken and directly understand the source of the mind, then the Three Baskets of teachings may be dispensed with, and the Six Divisions of scriptures may be discarded. Laozi spoke of “cutting off learning to be without care,” Yongjia of “cutting off learning to be without action,” Zhuangzi of “cutting off sageliness and discarding wisdom,” and Confucius of “I wish to be wordless”—when did they ever take writing as the Dao?

Should one ask: *The Book of Changes* is a Confucian text—why do those who study immortality take it as their standard?

I reply: Man’s form is modeled on Heaven and Earth, and *Changes* accords with Heaven and Earth; thus do scholars take it as their standard.

Should one ask: Is there a Dao beyond the *Changes*?

I say: The Dao of *Changes* begins with Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—this is the Dao of forms, and from it the School of Destiny is established. Before the One Qi coalesced and the Four Images divided, this was the formless Dao, and from it the School of Nature arises. The *Changes* with forms allows for the taking of images; the *Changes* without forms admits no names or words—this namelessness is the Dao beyond the *Changes*.

Should one ask: The Way of the Golden Elixir follows the *Changes*—is this not cumbersome?

I reply: My Dao resides in the Great Simplicity before separation, before the division of the Two Qi—what cumbersomeness is there?

Should one ask: If Confucians master the *Changes*, are they not also immortals?

I reply: Between Confucian and immortal, only a sheet of paper lies. Yet those Confucians study to seek worldly connections, amassing vast learning—though they refine their [ ] to their own use, they foster disbelief instead. This is how they differ from immortals.

Should one ask: This disciple reads the *Triple Concordance* of the Golden Elixir, yet [ ] walks through a bramble thicket—might you offer a single word of guidance on the straightforward path?

I reply: The elixir classics merely borrow images to clarify principles, use things to illuminate the mind. If one grasps the origin of nature and destiny, the subtlety of fire-times, then all images and things may be discarded, and the Dao of words forgotten. Why be turned by mere texts?

Should one ask: Master, you are a Daoist priest, yet your words always encompass Buddhism—why is this?

I reply: Though the forms of the head differ, the nature and principle remain the same. Though the teachings diverge, the Dao and Buddha have never differed in their root. Those who divide them are base scholars.

Should one ask: Later generations may not understand and might mistake you for a Chan practitioner.

I reply: Alas, is this so? I rectify nature and destiny through the Dao of immortality, and broaden wisdom through the study of the Buddha’s Way. The Dao of immortality does not die; the Dao of Buddha does not live. Neither dying nor living—this is the Mud-Pill Palace. The world does not comprehend this principle, clinging to one side, failing to realize the Great Vehicle, directing the mind narrowly, thinking only of themselves and not of all beings. Thus the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: There are ten kinds of immortals in the world, all of whom, among men, do not cultivate true awakening and, when their retribution is exhausted, return to the various destinies.

Should one ask: Can the methods of fasting and ritual offerings lead to sagehood and transcendence?

I reply: Before the Three Dynasties, such practices did not exist—they were merely methods of sacrifice. Among the followers of Laozi, they are called *jiao*; among Buddhists, *zhai*. Their words are nothing more than songs praising goodness. They bring three kinds of benefit: first, they inspire reverence in worldly people; second, they awaken the mind of generosity in worldly people; third, they benefit those who have left the household. If one relies on these to attain sagehood and transcendence, it is but a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow.

Should one ask: What is the meaning of the inversion of yin and yang?

I reply: The middle line of the two in Qian becomes Li; the middle line of the one in Kun becomes Kan. Li pertains to yin, yet is the sun; Kan pertains to yang, yet is the moon. Qian retreats and dwells in Kan; Kun retreats and dwells in Li. When Kan and Li unite, Qian and Kun restore their mandate. From below returning to above is called *return*; from the end returning to the origin is called *restoration*. This path of return and restoration is the inversion. Thus it is said: The sage swims against the current; the common person flows with it. Those who go against it form the elixir; those who follow it become mere things.

Should one ask: The elixir texts match the sixty-four hexagrams to a month, two months to a day, and take the waxing and waning of each line as the fire-times—is this method not the most direct path?

I reply: From the Great Ultimate, the One Qi splits to become Qian; two Qians become Kun. From Qian and Kun arise the sixty-four hexagrams, unfolding into three hundred eighty-four lines, accumulating into ten thousand and more—this is the Dao descending from its root to its branches. The sage, out of necessity, borrows the images of the *Changes* to match the Great Elixir. The wise person traces the current back to its source, cuts through the tangled silk with a single stroke, and works on the single word *one*. If one clings to images and follows the branches to their end, one will see only towering waves and vast surging waters. To seek outside rather than within the body—what delusion could be greater?

Should one ask: What is the meaning of *bathing*?

I reply: The fire-embryo is at *zi*, nurtured at *chou*, grows at *yin*, and bathes at *mao*. The water-embryo is at *wu*, nurtured at *wei*, grows at *shen*, and bathes at *you*. From *zi* to *yin* are the Three Yangs—this is the hexagram *Tai*. It is the position where fire is born, where the Two Qi are balanced, and above and below harmonize. Beyond *mao* is *Zhuang*, where yang’s vigor gradually increases and the yin path begins to depart—this is called *bathing*. Thus in the second month, the elm’s pods fall, for within yang there is punishment. From *wu* to *shen* are the Three Yins—this is the hexagram *Pi*. It is the position where water is born, where the Two Qi are balanced. Beyond *you* is *Guan*, where yin’s softness gradually increases and the yang path begins to depart—this too is called *bathing*. In the eighth month, the shepherd’s purse sprouts, for within yin there is virtue. Yang contains yin; yin contains yang—thus punishment and virtue bear each other, and day and night begin to divide. When refining the elixir to this point, cease the tally and do not move; nurture the original qi, bathe the Pearl of the Child, so that thoughts do not arise in the numinous terrace, cinnabar and mercury abide long in the golden crucible—like a newborn infant who must be bathed, so that this mind is pure, bare, and bright, like the full moon in the autumn sky, like a pearl on a fixed scale.

Should one ask: The elixir texts speak of internal elixirs that prolong life and external elixirs that enable ascension—are external elixirs not merely worldly medicines?

The answer is: The internal elixir is one’s own primordial qi. The external elixir is the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Yet this elixir fundamentally has no inside or outside—one’s own primordial qi is the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, and the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth is one’s own primordial qi. Inner and outer cannot be separated even for a moment; what can be separated is not the Dao. The ancient immortals, fearing that世人 would know only the internal medicine and not comprehend the great Dao, forcibly established the names "internal" and "external" so that people might know this and thereby understand that.

Later students often mistake external elixirs for worldly medicines—how could minerals, metals, herbs, and plants ever align with the wondrous workings of the original spirit of one’s destiny?

Someone asks: There are those who seek long life by absorbing yin to strengthen yang, indulging in the five pungent foods, wine, and meat to nourish themselves—can this be called the Dao?

The answer is: These are the perverse teachings of false masters who deceive the world, leading the purest yang into the filthiest yin, and mingling the clearest spirit with the most turbid qi. These are cattle, sheep, dogs, and horses—not of humankind. They are all seeds of hell; how can this be called the Dao? The perfected ones replenish with primordial essence and return it with primordial spirit, for this is the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth, not a technique of contrived effort.

Someone asks: How do the internal and external true elixirs unite?

The answer is: Humans are shaped in the likeness of Heaven and Earth; my body is equal to Heaven and Earth and does not fall short, my heart encompasses Heaven and Earth and does not exceed. The qi of Heaven and Earth is my qi, the essence of Heaven and Earth is my essence, the spirit of Heaven and Earth is my spirit. In movement and stillness, seeing and hearing, knowing and perceiving, this Dao never departs from my side. Yet世人 are ignorant of this and cannot reflect within, thus growing distant from the Dao. If one can turn the light inward, awaken to the original source, then the myriad images of the Three Powers all reside within one’s breast—where then is the distinction between inner and outer?

Someone asks: What of those who know internal refinement but do not comprehend the great Dao?

The answer is: Those who refine internally without understanding the great Dao can only prolong life. They are merely corpses whose essence and soul do not scatter; when their allotted span ends, they are reborn into the world—those with good fortune become human, those with meager fortune become other kinds. This is the fault of not comprehending the great Dao.

Someone asks: What of those who know the great Dao but do not practice, or know the internal medicine but do not refine it?

The answer is: Knowing but not acting is like someone describing food but never being full, speaking of treasure but never alleviating poverty. Though one may know, what benefit is there?

Someone asks: What of those who diligently practice but do not attain the true Dao, or study but do not encounter the authentic oral instructions?

The answer is:世上 are countless blind cultivators and misguided refiners who follow crooked paths and side trails. Though they may have a heart of diligence, they do not understand the great method, each clinging to their own views, relying on their own efforts, unwilling to draw near to good companions or seek out true friends. Their whole lives are thus wasted.

Someone asks: There are those who spend their years speaking of seeking and visiting masters, yet by the time their hair turns white, they gain nothing—whose fault is this?

The answer is: Among recent scholars, some carry a dead corpse and wander the rivers and lakes, only discussing where to spend the summer, where to endure the winter, where to beg for alms, where to find good food and drink. As for the medicines of inner and outer, the mechanisms of movement and stillness—when have they ever understood even a speck of it? The Dao does not fault people; people fault themselves.

Someone asks: Yang is dynamic, yin is quiescent—human nature is supremely quiescent. Does the learning of the Śākya clan not then belong to yin?

The answer is: Human nature precedes heaven and earth; it is the supremely quiescent and utterly empty Dao. The Three Powers and the myriad things all arise from it—it is the true ancestor of yang, the true source of life, the true root of spirit, the fundamental origin of all wonders. Yet people often fail to grasp its subtlety, mistakenly calling quiescent nature yin and dynamic life yang. For movement must take stillness as its substance, and stillness must take movement as its function—this is an inescapable principle of heaven and earth. Moreover, they do not know that within heaven and earth there exists an unchanging wonder, the master of the Three Powers and the myriad things. This quiescence does not follow the rise and fall of yin and yang, does not follow the coming and going of cold and heat, does not pass away with life and death, is not altered by the changes of past and present. It is neither within yin and yang nor beyond movement and stillness. It departs not from purity, yet does not mingle with turbidity. This is the learning of the Śākya clan. To call it yin is to miss its true wonder and lightly dismiss it as wrong. Those who cultivate the Golden Elixir without attaining such clarity are but followers of the Two Vehicles.

Someone asks: It is said that Master Xu Jingyang once mixed a grain-sized elixir with other medicines to sell, yet none who bought it ever encountered its power. Xu sighed, lamenting the rarity of true immortal talent. Does the elixir of immortals truly exist to deliver people, only for the world to miss it?

The answer is: When the primordial elixir remains unrefined and the great Dao of the Most High is obscured, to hope that immortals will deliver one with elixirs is like dreaming of food and drink, then waking to seek satiety—like dreaming of treasures, then waking to seek wealth. There is no difference. Elixirs are not said to be nonexistent; the ancients used them to prolong life. Though they may assist yang, they cannot achieve completion. For these are but the borrowed forms of metals, stones, herbs, and trees—how could they ever match the true elixir within our own bodies? Master Xu used them to test the worthy: if one had the karmic affinity for immortality, he would teach them the Dao. How could a mere grain of medicine grant immortality?

Someone asks: Immortality must depend on past-life affinities—it cannot be attained in a single day. Those like us, whose lot does not reach so far, fear it is too difficult to learn.

The answer is: In the inherent lot of every person, all is originally complete; in every heart, nothing is initially lacking. Only resolve the will, and you will not be led astray. If one directly abandons killing, theft, lust, desire, and casts off greed, anger, delusion, and attachment; if one grows weary of the world’s snares, deeply awakens the Dao-mind, seeks a clear teacher, and inquires of wise companions—suddenly breaking through the true mechanism and knowing where nature and life reside—then one may instantly become immortal or a buddha. How could it require three or four lifetimes, chasing shadows and following forms? To say one’s lot does not reach so far is merely a failure of the heart, a self-imposed retreat and surrender. If one claims to have no affinity in past lives, none in this life, and none in future lives, then one will be forever distant from the Dao.

Someone asks: Setting aside the flowers, sprouts, branches, and leaves, what is the most true, most correct, most essential, and most direct aspect of the Golden Elixir? Pray, grant a single word.

The answer is: The Golden Elixir is not a matter of many affairs—people multiply affairs themselves. The most true lies in one’s own spirit and qi. The most correct lies in the primordial lead and mercury. The most essential lies in the union of the two arcs. The most direct lies in the even regulation of the fire times. All else is but metaphor and discourse—though abundant, what use is it?

Someone asks: What is the meaning of the seven returns and nine refinements?

The answer is: Seven is the complete number of fire; nine is the complete number of metal. Seven and nine together make one catty. *Return* means returning to the root; *refinement* means reverting to the source. Combined, they form the two eights, paired as the two arcs—seven and nine are yang numbers. When metal and fire reach this point, yin and kidney are both dissolved, spirit and essence merge, like the moon becoming full as treasure, the Silver River’s waves stilled, a lone boat reaching shore, a traveler returning home. Having attained the root, one forgets the branches—this is called returning and refining.

Someone asks: Gathering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images, the Three Flowers gathering at the crown, the Five Qi returning to the origin—all reside within this single body. Yet Master Ziyang also said: It is neither heart nor chest, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the cinnabar field, neither the valley passage, nor the bladder, nor the muddy pellet. What does this mean?

The answer is: Does *The Awakening to Reality* not say: To refine essence is to refine primordial essence, not the essence stirred by licentiousness; to refine qi is to refine primordial qi, not the breath of mouth and nose; to refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, not the spirit of thoughts and intentions. Thus, this spirit and qi share the same root as heaven and earth, the same body as the myriad things. To attain them is to live; to lose them is to die. The sages’ intent shines as brightly as the sun and moon. Yet without this body, who would know the Dao? Without knowing the Dao, this body is but an empty vessel. One must align the person with the Dao, and the Dao with the person—thus it is said: spirit and form both wondrous, united with the Dao in truth. Master Ziyang, fearing that later generations would fail to understand the mysterious female’s aperture, would merely swallow essence, ingest qi, manipulate and massage, cling to the physical body, and secure their dwelling as the great Dao, spoke expediently to break their attachments. This is the body; this is the Dao—how could they ever be separated for even a moment?

Someone asked: "Within the year, one takes the month; within the month, the day; within the day, the hour; within the hour, the moment—thus, in the space of a single breath, the elixir of the Dao congeals. If this is so, then are all the fire-phases of the celestial cycle merely empty efforts?"

The answer: "The sages’ mechanism is swift as lightning; within a single breath, the workings of spirit may be verified. Yet while the elixir may congeal in the space of a single breath, it cannot be obtained in that instant alone. One must investigate ceaselessly, practice daily, and maintain it with unbroken continuity—subtly present, applied without strain—until one returns to the root and restores life. Then one may abide in stillness and constancy. One must not seek only the work of a single breath and thus squander a lifetime, nor should one cling to words and images, deluding oneself in vain."

Someone asked: "The books of the Yellow River and Luo River are all systems of numbers. Yet the great Dao is formless, while qi and numbers possess form. Is the golden elixir also bound by numbers?"

The answer: "Before the Supreme Ultimate took form, images and numbers were hidden within the great Dao. Once the Supreme Ultimate arose, images and numbers emerged from the One. The One is the root of the Three Powers and the myriad things, the origin of the Five Phases and the Eight Trigrams. Though the great Dao is formless, it lodges its form in images and its position in numbers. Beginning with the Supreme Ultimate, it descends to become numbers, culminating in images and numbers, then returns to become the Dao. When sages discuss the golden elixir in terms of images and numbers, it is out of necessity. The sages must transcend the realm of images and things, the bounds of qi and numbers—how could they be confined to the mere patterns of images and numbers?"

Someone asked: "Why must the Way of the golden elixir be spoken of in terms of numbers?"

The answer: "That which precedes the Supreme Ultimate is not discussed in terms of numbers. That which follows the Supreme Ultimate must be expressed through numbers. The superior adept forgets images and numbers to grasp the One; the middling adept relies on images and numbers to guard the One; the inferior adept studies images and numbers to seek the One. Without numbers, there would be no means to guide later learners—thus images are established as expedient teachings."

Someone asked: "Kan (☵) and Li (☲) oppose each other, yet mutually overcome and unite; Zhen (☳) and Dui (☱) oppose each other, yet mutually overcome without uniting. Why is this?"

The answer: "In Qian (☰), the two central lines form Li; in Kun (☷), the single central line forms Kan. When Kan and Li unite, the bodies of Qian and Kun are restored. As the *Book of Changes* says: 'Water and fire shoot at each other,' thus achieving completion. Only the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li represent the union of central correctness. Zhen, Xun, Gen, and Dui are all partial unions. The golden elixir takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, for it draws upon the union of central correctness as the Dao. When Zhen and Dui shoot at each other, they create separation; in the hexagrams, this is *Guimei* (归妹), while Gen and Xun form *Gu* (蛊)—both are images of imbalance."

Someone asked: "What is the golden liquid returning elixir?"

The answer: "In Kan, the one and six combine to make seven, which is the completion number of fire—this is the true fire within Kan. In Li, the two and seven combine to make nine, the completion number of metal—this is the true gold within Li. When gold is refined by fire, it melts into liquid and descends to the kidneys, where it is called lead. When fire is tempered by water, it transforms into essence and ascends to the heart, where it is called mercury. The wonder of the returning elixir lies in the interplay of gold and fire; the wonder of their union lies in Kan and Li. When the golden liquid in the heart descends to return to the kidneys, this is called the golden liquid returning elixir."

Someone asked: "If one does not know the great medicine or the fire-phases, but merely accumulates merit and performs good deeds, can one attain long life and ascend as an immortal?"

The answer: "Among the immortals of the Three Realms and the buddhas of the ten directions, none have attained fruition without accumulating merit, performing good deeds, and cultivating causes. Among the five destinies, only humans can learn the Dao. If one wishes to attain long life and ascend as an immortal, one must clearly understand the fire-phases and the conditions of the great Dao. Without knowing its wonders, even if one accumulates merit and performs good deeds, one will only enjoy the blessings of humanity and heaven in the future. When those blessings are exhausted, one will still undergo rebirth—this is not the unborn and undying Dao."

Someone asked: "The Buddhist teachings on precepts are strict, detailed, and comprehensive, while the alchemical texts only speak of cultivation and refinement, barely mentioning fasting and precepts. Why is this?"

The answer: "Wisdom gives rise to the root of precepts; without fasting and precepts, how can one practice the Dao? The Heavenly Worthy has the Nine Precepts and Forty-Nine Precepts; Xishan has the Ten Precepts for Cultivating Reality and the Twenty-Four Precepts—these are no less strict, detailed, and comprehensive than the Buddhist precepts. For those who study the Dao, without fasting, the mind of killing cannot be severed; without precepts, the desires of the will cannot be cut off. If even one precept is not cultivated, a hundred transgressions will disorder the mind. If even one desire is not dispelled, a multitude of evils will trouble the heart. If the six desires are not eliminated and the three poisons are not extinguished, the heart-snake will not die, and the mind-horse will gallop endlessly—can this be called the Dao? Those who claim that understanding the Dao alone suffices, without fasting and precepts, are followers of demonic spirits. How can they be worthy of mention?"

Someone asked: "Laozi said, 'Those who cling are unclear about the Dao and virtue.' Is the method of the golden elixir not close to clinging?"

The answer: "Clinging to the head of a dead snake without knowing change, being glued to the five desires without liberation, indulging in greed, anger, and delusion without turning back, committing killing, theft, and lust without awakening—all such actions, seeking blessings and coveting merit, are clinging, and thus cannot be called the Dao and virtue. The Way of the golden elixir silently moves water and fire, truly uniting with the mysterious origin—acting without acting, yet without non-acting. It begins in non-being and ends in being; yet in the end, it does not abide in being, and in the beginning, it does not abide in non-being. Like the autumn moon flowing in the sky, like idle clouds emerging from the peaks—pure and free, lively and fluid—this is the wonder of the golden elixir. Where is there any clinging?"

Someone asked: "I wish to hear about the initial practice. What is it?"

The answer: "Move the mind without distraction, focus the qi to attain softness—like the handle of the Dipper circling the heavens, like the two wheels turning the hub. The ancient immortals said: 'Qi is the medicine that adds years; the mind is the spirit that directs qi. If you know the point where qi moves, you are already an immortal.'"

To harmonize the heart and qi is to truly unite mercury and lead, and knowing the origin and pathway of the qi’s cavity—this is the initial practice. This Dao is not lightly transmitted, though its value exceeds a thousand gold.

Someone asked: "Regarding the gathering of medicine, the congealing of the elixir, the firing and refining, the sealing and safeguarding, the nurturing and warding off danger, the guarding of the city, and the battles in the wild—could you reveal these without concealment?"

The answer: "Works such as *The Awakening to Reality*, *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, *Returning to the Source*, *Restoring Life*, *Discerning Delusions*, *The Marrow of the Yin Talisman*, and *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine*—these golden words uttered by the ancestral immortals shine as brightly as the sun, with nothing hidden or obscured. They have opened the way for the world in abundance. If you can see through them clearly and awaken fully, the texts you ask about already contain all explanations. Why would one need to expound on each in turn?"

Someone asked: "What is the meaning of the separation between metal and wood?"

The answer: "Metal corresponds to the lungs, the nose, the corporeal soul, and the senses of smell. Wood corresponds to the liver, the eyes, the ethereal soul, and the perception of forms. When the eyes are enslaved by forms, the ethereal soul scatters; when the nose is enslaved by fragrances, the corporeal soul disperses. Wood resides in the east, metal in the west—these two cannot naturally mediate their union, hence they are said to be separated. To unite them, one must rely on the earthly branches *wu* and *ji*. Metal, born of earth, can thus restrain wood; wood, subdued by metal, returns to earth. Without this mutual restraint, the elixir cannot be formed. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mind—when they pursue their objects—are all termed ‘separation,’ not merely metal and wood."

Someone asked about the essential meaning of the golden elixir.

The answer: "It is the central harmony of the five qi, the blending of the hundred spirits. Then, forget the form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness—this encompasses the entire meaning."

Someone asked about the essential meaning of nurturing.

The answer: "It is the regulation of harmony—nothing more."

Someone asked about the essential meaning of firing times.

The answer: "Using the heart to guide qi, uniting essence with spirit, circulating through the waxing and waning phases without cease—this fulfills the firing times."

Someone asked about the essential meaning of returning to the true.

The answer: "When spirit and form are both wondrous, they merge with the Dao in truth."

Someone asked about the essential meaning of preservation and adherence.

The answer: "Preserve it as one would preserve the throne, adhere to it as one would entrust a great minister. Neither beginning nor end falters, neither center nor periphery falls away. Even if treading through boiling water or facing blades and saws, this matter remains unlost—this is what is called preservation and adherence."

Someone asked about the essential meaning of practice and perseverance.

The answer: "Harmonious yet not drifting, like spring returning to a cold valley; moving yet not ceasing, like the moon shining in a clear sky. In all twelve hours, forget things—detached from the world as if merely passing through."

Someone asked about the essential meaning of transcendence.

The answer: "Ultimately, one must leave the household while preserving the master, discard the false while retaining the true. As the ancient immortals said: 'When the work is complete, one must depart the capital of spirit; do not cling to the body amid the inner court’s splendor.'"

Someone asked about the true origin.

The answer: "True constancy, true stillness, true emptiness, original essence, original spirit, original qi—these six are all contained within the one heart. If one attains them, one immediately ascends to the realm of the sages."

Someone asked: "How do the cauldron, medicine, and firing times correspond?"

The answer: "The ancients took heaven and earth as the cauldron, *kan* and *li* as the medicine, and the cyclic movement of the four trigrams *zhen*, *dui*, *xun*, and *gen* as the firing times. Borrowing external images to match internal ones, not a hair’s breadth lies outside this body."

Someone said: "Modern scholars are in disarray, each holding to their own doctrine—out of a thousand, not one agrees. Why is this?"

The answer: "Without a sage, no one speaks of the sage’s medicine; without a teacher, no one speaks of the spirit’s method. Each fails to receive the true transmission, so though many study, none succeed."

Someone asked: "When the practice reaches its fruition, what is the state like?"

The answer: "At first, it is like an infant returning to its mother; next, like fine wine nearing intoxication. Then, like warmth bathing in a cool breeze, or cold basking in the gentle sun. The mouth forgets speech, the eyes forget sight, the nose forgets scent, the ears forget sound, the mind forgets thoughts, the body forgets existence—only the sense of a single, harmonious qi flowing naturally remains. Even this awareness fades, and one no longer knows how or why. Such is the state when the practice reaches its fruition."

They asked: "Is this state called ‘spirit and form both wondrous’?"

The answer: "At that time, it is like a fish drinking water—cool or warm, only the self knows."

Someone asked: "Is there anything beyond the wonder of the golden elixir?"

The answer: "There are paths that go beyond this, but they lead to side doors and are not worth pursuing as the Dao."

Someone asked: "The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not inanimate like earth and wood—how can one keep them constantly still throughout the twelve hours?"

The answer: "I never said to make them as dull as earth and wood in all twelve hours. Rather, when the eyes see forms, do not chase after them; when the ears hear sounds, do not chase after them; when the nose smells fragrances, do not chase after them; when the tongue tastes flavors, do not chase after them; when the body seeks pleasure and ease, do not chase after them; when the mind generates thoughts and delusions, do not chase after them. The six desires cannot seize the heart, the myriad phenomena cannot delude the will. The heart does not cling to things—how could things obstruct me? If one can do this, dwelling amid the forest of the five desires for twelve hours brings no harm. One only needs to be the master—why wait for years on end in rigid stillness?"

Someone said: "There are ancient accounts of those who left their forms behind in the world, living alongside others for years, only to vanish without a trace afterward. Why is this?"

The answer: "The form is merely a burden in the world. Consider the dragon and phoenix—if bound by worldly confinement, their forms are imprisoned, their natures caged, and they may ultimately face dismemberment and destruction. As Laozi said: 'My greatest worry is that I have a body.'"

Ultimately, one must shed the womb and change the bones—how could one remain in the old dwelling without transformation?

Someone asked: "The Venerable Master of Piling once said: *'If one cannot live a thousand or ten thousand years, why be a person in this world?'* Yet is this saying merely empty?"

The answer: "Were it not for the purple streets where flowers bloom like brocade, how could the golden oriole descend from the willow branches? If one did not speak of living a thousand or ten thousand years, how could people be persuaded to enter this gate? This is the ancient masters’ skillful expedient speech. If one truly attains the marvel of the Golden Elixir, then one’s life may surpass the touchstone and equal the emptiness of space. A thousand or ten thousand years are but a fleeting bubble upon the great sea—how could they be considered long?"

Someone asked: "Kan and Li must take Wu and Ji as their master. I wish to hear the meaning of this."

The answer: "In Qian, the two central lines form Li; in Kun, the one central line forms Kan. Once the Four Images are established, Wu and Ji reside in the Central Palace. Thus, Kan is received by Wu, and Li by Ji. For Kan and Li intermingle without departing from the positions of Wu and Ji. Yet Kan’s water and Li’s fire naturally contend with each other. It is only because Wu and Ji dwell in the center, generating control and mediation, that water and fire do not repel each other and can instead interact harmoniously. As Ziyang said: *'If Kan and Li lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the Four Images, the Elixir will not form.'* Thus, Kan and Li must take Wu and Ji as their master."

Someone asked: "Metal and Wood are separated—are Geng and Jia also separated?"

The answer: "Metal lies in the West, Wood in the East; this is called separation. Yet through the movement of Kan and Li at the center, Wood conceals its form within Li, and Metal conceals its form within Kan, so they unite as one family. Geng is the place where the moon emerges—on the third day, the moon appears at Geng. Jia is the place where the moon becomes full—on the fifteenth, it is full at Jia. Thus, Geng is produced in Kun and receives Jia in Zhen. For Zhen, inheriting Kun’s body, is the eldest son, the place where the Great Medicine is produced and the beginning of the fire-timing. Hence it is said: *'The Medicine is produced in the southwest—this is its native land.'* Geng and Jia are the places of the moon’s birth and fullness—this is not what is meant by separation."

Someone asked: "There are those who do not understand themselves but engage in extreme asceticism—self-immolation, self-defenestration, self-starvation, self-mutilation—hastening the destruction of their bodies in pursuit of the fruit of the Dao. What is this?"

The answer: "The body is the tree of the Dao. When the tree stands, the fruit grows; if the tree withers early, the fruit perishes with it. Fools, not understanding the fundamental meaning, only make enemies of their bodies. With their minds still deluded, they burn themselves, sever their arms, leap from cliffs, drown in waters, abstain from grain, and starve themselves—inflicting suffering upon themselves, only to drift ever farther from the Dao. The Buddhist scriptures say: *'All the various external paths engage in all manner of strenuous ascetic practices—leaping from cliffs, plunging into water and fire, scorching their bodies with the Five Heats.'* These words are spoken precisely for such people."

Someone asked: "Yet the ancients also burned their bodies, severed their arms, cut off their flesh, and sacrificed their lives—why was this?"

The answer: "If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening. Those ancients had all heard the Dao and understood it clearly, so they regarded death as merely shedding a soiled garment or discarding worn-out sandals."

Someone asked: "In foreign lands, monks and Daoists all slaughter oxen and horses for sacrifices, consuming blood and flesh as their vegetarian offerings. Is it that such practices are permitted there but forbidden here?"

The answer: "The flesh of sentient beings is no different from the flesh of one’s own body. Those who leave the household life distinguish themselves from the worldly by upholding the precepts. Thus, they may serve as models for humans and gods, protecting and sustaining all living beings, transcending the realms of humans and gods. Those who drink blood and devour raw flesh belong to a different kind of external path—they sever the seed of great compassion and prolong the fruits of karmic retribution. How can they be spoken of in the same breath?"

Someone asked: "Nowadays, some claim that fish and meat are warming and can be beneficial, while vegetables are cold and, if eaten for long, diminish vitality. Should those who seek long life simply consume meat?"

The answer: "Those who favor fish and meat will say vegetables are cold; those who favor vegetables will say fish and meat are foul. Yet those who eat fish and meat are consuming sentient beings—sentient beings devouring one another without end. For those who study the Dao, killing is the foremost precept. How can they not be cautious?"

Someone asked: "From where does the awareness of the human body arise?"

The answer: "Before this form was born, there was no awareness. Because form unites with qi, and qi gives rise to spirit, and spirit gives rise to consciousness, once these are complete, the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and the sufferings of hunger, cold, illness, and pain—all are universally known and universally perceived. All things of blood and qi are like this."

Someone asked: "Can spirit attain long life? Can form avoid death?"

The answer: "Form is the root of spirit. If one nurtures form to the point of not dying, how could the nurturing of spirit ever end? When both spirit and form attain subtlety, this is the way of the highest immortals. Yet even those who leave their forms in the world, though they may live five hundred or a thousand years, ultimately cannot escape the transformation of the womb and the replacement of the cauldron. Form has its term, but spirit is without limit. How can they be spoken of as the same?"

Someone asked: "Spirit is one—yet there are said to be yang spirit and yin spirit. I wish to hear the meaning of this."

The answer: "Yang spirit is not the spirit of discursive thought and deluded念. This spirit is pure, still, luminous, and all-pervading, nowhere it does not reach. Though it emerges, it does not depart from the root fundamental wisdom. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *'Without leaving the bodhi tree, one ascends the summit of Mount Sumeru'*—this is the unmoving wisdom that pervades all. Yin spirit is the spirit of stored thoughts and transformations. This spirit varies in function and becomes obstructed wherever it goes. When it emerges, it must depart from the root fundamental wisdom and often dwells near ghosts and spirits. Yang spirit is the way of heaven; yin spirit is the way of ghosts. Yang is numinous awareness, empty and mysterious; yin is dream-thought, inverted and confused. Scholars cannot fail to distinguish between them."

Someone asked: "What is root fundamental wisdom?"

The answer: "Root fundamental wisdom is the wisdom that existed before the empty kalpa. The Three Powers and the myriad things all embrace it."

This wisdom is neither separate nor conjoined, neither form nor sound, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither emerging nor entering—all sentient beings equally possess it. My body’s birth does not increase it; my body’s death does not diminish it. Without leaving the original seat, it responds and manifests throughout the ten directions; without moving body or mind, it embraces and fuses with all. It mingles with the myriad things yet remains unstained; it engages with the ten thousand affairs yet remains unburdened. Is this not root fundamental wisdom?

Someone asked: "The alchemical texts number in the hundreds and thousands, yet they speak only of longevity and rarely address matters of death. Though 'birth' is repeatedly expounded, what of birth and death?"

The answer: "Longevity without death is the Dao of the Supreme Perfection and eternal constancy—it is no empty claim of the ancients. Yet the world, deluded in principle, fails to comprehend the essence of transcendence, often seeking strange marvels and treasuring fortified dwellings. Though scholars number in the tens of thousands, not one attains success. My words on birth and death are precisely to illuminate birth and death, that one may end birth and death—not mere forced speech."

Someone asked: "After your hundred years, will you be as you were in life?"

The answer: "The body is the root of suffering; I discard this body as one discards a boil or wart—this is what is meant by 'delivering from all suffering and distress.' Yet my original nature has never begun or ended; though formless, what expectation could there be?"

They said: "If there is no difference from birth and death, do you still partake in worldly affairs?"

The answer: "Though I do not partake in worldly affairs, the mind that vows to deliver the world has never been absent."

Someone asked: "If form cannot be preserved and death cannot be avoided, what use are the golden elixir and the firing times?"

The answer: "All that has form and color in heaven and earth is not exempt from death. The golden elixir is my nature and spirit; the firing times are my yin and yang. Cultivating the golden elixir, one harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth and unites brightness with the sun and moon—what value is there in the dreamlike, illusory form?"

**On the Supreme Polarity**

Someone asked about categories of the Supreme Polarity.

**Question:** The generation of the Three Powers originates from the Supreme Polarity, but from what does the Supreme Polarity itself originate?

**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity originates from the Ultimateless.

**Question:** And from what does the Ultimateless originate?

**Answer:** The Ultimateless has no origin; if it had an origin, it would not be called the Ultimateless.

**Question:** What is the form of the Ultimateless?

**Answer:** The Ultimateless has no form; if it had form, it would have a limit.

**Question:** If the Ultimateless has no form, why is it named the Ultimateless?

**Answer:** It cannot be named; we forcefully name it the Ultimateless.

**Question:** Are the Ultimateless and the Supreme Polarity one or two?

**Answer:** The Ultimateless is the Supreme Polarity’s non-being; the Supreme Polarity is the Ultimateless’s being. They are not two principles.

**Question:** If they involve being and non-being, how can they not be two?

**Answer:** From non-being, being is established; through being, non-being is revealed. They mutually serve as roots—two meanings, yet one principle.

**Question:** The Supreme Polarity originates from non-being and is rooted in stillness. Why then does it have being? Why does it move?

**Answer:** When non-being reaches its limit, being is born; when stillness reaches its limit, movement arises.

**Question:** If non-being and being, movement and stillness, are opposed to the Supreme Polarity, does its original essence still remain?

**Answer:** Being is born from non-being, yet non-being is fundamentally not separate from being. Stillness is born from movement, yet stillness is fundamentally unmoving. The original essence of the Supreme Polarity remains unchanged.

**Question:** Does the Dao of the Supreme Polarity have above and below, inside and outside?

**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity is without direction; if it had above and below, inside and outside, it would become two Supreme Polarities.

**Question:** If the One has no above or below, why does it have before and after?

**Answer:** Before qi took form, the Supreme Polarity preceded heaven and earth. Once qi was divided, heaven and earth came after the Supreme Polarity.

**Question:** Is human nature the same as or different from the Supreme Polarity?

**Answer:** Human nature is the nature of the Supreme Polarity. If its principle aligns with the Supreme Polarity, it is the same; if its principle differs, it is different.

**Question:** Is the nature of things also the same as the Supreme Polarity?

**Answer:** Though their forms and vessels differ, their nature is the same.

**Question:** If the Ultimateless has no image, how can it generate the Supreme Polarity?

**Answer:** The Ultimateless is purely principle. From principle arises qi. When qi and principle intermingle, it is called the Supreme Polarity—not that the Ultimateless generates the Supreme Polarity.

**Question:** How does the Supreme Polarity, by contracting, generate yang, and by stillness, generate yin?

**Answer:** When stillness reaches its limit, movement is born; movement, unceasing, generates qi. Qi rooted in stillness is yin; qi rooted in movement is yang. When movement reaches its limit, yin is born; when stillness reaches its limit, yang is born. From beginning to end, it does not depart from movement and stillness.

**Question:** How does the Supreme Polarity generate the Two Modes?

**Answer:** Qi and principle envelop each other; yin and yang qualities are complete. What is united must separate, and thus it divides into two. That which is above form becomes heaven; that which is below form becomes earth.

**Question:** How should one practice to align with the Supreme Polarity?

**Answer:** One must first comprehend the reality of the Supreme Polarity and awaken to the subtleties of principle and qi. Then, silently recognize it and embody it in practice. If one has not grasped this essential point and merely debates over texts or discusses names and principles, it is entirely without benefit.

**Question:** Once this principle is understood, where does one rest?

**Answer:** One rests in perfect stillness. If even a hair’s breadth of selfish desire arises, it is not genuine.

**Question:** The human mind is perilous. How can it be entirely without movement? Would that not make one like wood or stone?

**Answer:** There is a mind of peril, and there is a mind of subtlety. Subtlety is stillness. Curb movement and return to stillness—this is the stillness of the Supreme Polarity. Though there is no movement of thought, it is not the same as wood or stone.

**Question:** Words suffice to convey meaning; why pursue this so exhaustively? Is this not pedantic?

**Answer:** The Dao is what the Three Powers and the myriad things cannot be without for even a moment. If one could be without this Dao, then stars could emerge from the earth, mountains and seas could hang from the sky, spring could become autumn, and winter could become summer. If mere eloquence were the Dao, then the Confucian tradition would not need Confucius, the Chan school would not need Śākyamuni, and the Daoist tradition would not need Laozi.

**Question:** Are the methods of self-cultivation and application in Confucianism the same as those in Daoism and Buddhism?

**Answer:** The methods of self-cultivation are not different; their applications are not without distinction.

**Question:** May I ask for details?

**Answer:** The Confucians cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to govern the world. The Daoists cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to preserve form and spirit. The Buddhists cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to equalize life and death.

**Question:** If there is fundamentally only one Supreme Polarity, why do the Three Teachings and the hundred schools speak of so many similarities and differences? How is one to understand this?

**Answer:** If one seeks understanding through words and phrases, even after eating three lifetimes’ worth of rice, one will not fully comprehend.

**Question:** Then how is it to be understood?

**Answer:** Unify the One to return to the One; meet its limit to return to its limit.

**Question:** Is it wrong to grasp this mind as the Dao?

**Answer:** At first, one grasps it; upon realization, one lets go. To grasp without letting go is stagnation; to let go without grasping is free flow.

**Question:** If one lets go, does it not fall into neglect?

**Answer:** Letting go into non-action is acceptable; one must not let go into deviance.

**Question:** Does Buddhism also address the Supreme Polarity?

**Answer:** They speak of "beginninglessness" and "true emptiness"; these are merely different names for the original nature of the Supreme Polarity. Yet their subtlety surpasses even the Supreme Polarity.

**Question:** When heaven and earth divide, the Five Phases and their images and numbers are precise to the finest detail, and the myriad things of human relations are as intricately carved—does this not imply a Creator within the primordial chaos?

The Supreme Polarity, when yet unformed, conceals the Five Phases and their images and numbers within true nothingness. Once the Supreme Polarity divides, the Five Phases and their images and numbers manifest within wondrous being. The formation of the Three Powers and the nurturing of the myriad things—all arise from the spontaneous operation of the singular qi. For once the Supreme Polarity is established, it cannot but give rise to heaven and earth. Once heaven and earth are established, they cannot but generate images and numbers. Once images and numbers are complete, they cannot but produce human beings and things. Once human beings and things take form, their physical endowments cannot but differ. Once physical endowments differ, their lifespans and destinies cannot but vary. Flourishing and withering, beauty and ugliness, good and evil—these are the natural course of principle, and also the inevitable course of circumstance. Yet the creation of things from formlessness begins with the singular qi, transforming into the ten thousand existences, each conforming to its natural measure. How could there be a creator?

**Question:** At the inception of heaven and earth, which came first—sun and moon, or water and fire?

**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity divides into one yang and one yin. The Qian Dao is first established, and the two Qian form Kun, establishing the Kun Dao. Splitting the center of Qian yields Li, and the image of the sun is formed. Merging the center of Kun yields Kan, and the image of the moon is formed. The Four Images are established, the Eight Trigrams are arrayed, the Five Phases emerge, and the myriad things are born—none of which are not brought forth by water and fire. In the movement of heaven and earth, the sun and moon, the images of water and fire, come first.

**Question:** Does the Dao of heaven have intention?

**Answer:** The Dao is without intention; it takes the hearts of all people as its heart.

**Question:** Yet it is said, "Stimulated, it penetrates all"—why is this?

**Answer:** Do you understand water? When you approach it, your form and shadow appear of themselves. Do you understand valleys? When you call out, there is always an echo. Do water and valleys have intention?

**Question:** Heaven is said to belong to metal—is it truly metal?

**Answer:** Kun is earth, and it is true earth. Qian is metal—is it not true metal?

**Question:** Below the earth, one looks up to heaven as the pole. Above heaven, where is the pole?

**Answer:** Above, there is only the natural emptiness of the void—it is the pole beyond poles.

**Question:** If so, then heaven and earth have no root or stem?

**Answer:** The singular qi of emptiness naturally transforms and forms them—how could there be a root or stem?

**Question:** The Confucians speak of "rectifying the heart," the Buddhists of "illuminating the heart," and the Daoists of "emptying the heart"—are these three the same or different?

**Answer:** "Thought without deviance" is rectitude; "turning the light inward upon oneself" is illumination; "private desires unobstructed" is emptiness. Though called three hearts, they are in truth one principle. From the perspective of worldly people, their teachings differ, but at the level of the sage, there is no difference.

**Question:** The Buddhist teaching says, "The heart itself is Buddha," and also, "Neither heart nor Buddha"—are these statements contradictory?

**Answer:** "The heart itself is Buddha" is like obtaining the fish or catching the hare. "Neither heart nor Buddha" is like forgetting the trap or the snare.

**Question:** The Buddhists always speak of the heart, while the Daoists always speak of qi—are the heart and qi one or two?

**Answer:** When the heart moves, qi follows; when qi moves, the heart follows. When the heart is unified, qi is also unified; when qi is unified, the heart is also unified. Yet qi is principle, while the heart is the mechanism of principle. All great undertakings proceed from our heart.

**Question:** The Buddhists say that all hearts speak of emptiness—why is this?

**Answer:** Only through emptiness can one contain the ten thousand things.

**Question:** If it contains the ten thousand things, then it is not empty.

**Answer:** To contain the ten thousand things without obstructing them is like the great void embracing all things—it is not hindered by the vastness of space.

**Question:** The heart has principle and has realm—what are principle and realm?

**Answer:** "Essence and unity" are the principle of the heart. "Affairs and things" are the realm of the heart. "Subtle, wondrous, and spiritually penetrating, unobstructed by things"—this is the principle of the heart. "Floating, restless, and competitive, chasing after forms"—this is the realm of the heart.

**Question:** If the heart moves once, one stops it; if it moves again, one stops it again—can this be the Dao?

**Answer:** This is precisely the appearance of ceaseless arising and ceasing. One must stop it so that it does not move repeatedly. With long practice and discipline, when it is thoroughly tamed, it then becomes a single whole.

**Question:** Is becoming a single whole the Dao?

**Answer:** If at this point one clings to it as the Dao, it is like grasping a water-seeking mirror to obtain water. Not only will one fail to get water, but one will ultimately be hindered by the object. How much better to forget both!

**Question:** Did the sages of old who illuminated the heart all attain this?

**Answer:** Those who do not reach this level are not worthy of the name Dao.

**Question:** People say that each heart is different—can this differing principle also become the Dao?

**Answer:** All may be called the Dao, but they do not reach the level of the sage.

**Question:** Some people begin good and end evil, while others begin evil and end good—is this not a matter of habit becoming nature?

**Answer:** It is indeed formed by habit, all due to a lack of careful self-control. Those who begin good and end evil descend from human relationships to the level of beasts. Those who begin evil and end good rise from the level of beasts to human relationships.

**Question:** For the hundred diseases, there are medicinal remedies. What remedies the sickness of the heart?

**Answer:** The sickness of the heart is remedied by principle.

**Question:** What if there are those who do not accept the remedy of principle?

**Answer:** If the source of the sickness runs deep, one must apply the painful needle and moxa. If it does not heal, then death is all that remains.

**Question:** When the heart is not at peace, what should one do?

**Answer:** It is only because your thoughts do not cease and your delusions do not stop.

**Question:** The heart and nature are but a single principle—is there a nature outside the heart?

**Answer:** Nature is the substance of the heart; the heart is the function of nature. Nature is still; the heart is active. When the function of the heart is not moved, the substance of nature merges and harmonizes. The foolish seek nature outside the heart, while the wise see that nature is the heart—there is no other.

**Answer:** It is only this square inch of space that is the heart—there is no heart outside this square inch.

**Answer:** The square inch is the pivot of the heart’s mechanism. This heart pervades the vastness of space and the six directions; when the pivot moves, the heart moves; when the pivot is still, the heart is still. To seek the heart beyond the square inch is not the heart. To cling to the square inch as the heart is also not so.

**Question:** The heart is but a single principle, yet it is also called the enclosure of all principles—why?

**Answer:** The heavens have but one moon, yet its reflection appears in ten thousand waters. A person has but one heart, yet affairs manifest in ten thousand forms. Yet the moon in ten thousand waters is gathered into one moon; the heart in ten thousand affairs is gathered into one heart. Is this not the heart as their enclosure?

**Question:** The Confucians say: "Only after stopping does one attain stability; only after stability does one attain stillness; only after stillness does one attain peace; only after peace does one attain contemplation; only after contemplation does one attain attainment." The Buddhists also speak of stability and stillness, yet they say there is not a single dharma to be attained—why?

**Answer:** The Confucians take stopping, stability, and stillness as the root, and peace, contemplation, and attainment as the branch. If one does not pacify the heart and refine contemplation, the virtue of utmost goodness cannot be made manifest. If the virtue of utmost goodness is not manifest, the world cannot be governed. The Buddhists are not thus: only after stopping does one attain stability; only after stillness does one attain peace—necessarily, this heart is without contemplation and unattainable, reaching the state of profound emptiness and quiescence. That contemplation attains the governance of the world is the natural principle. That without contemplation one enters the empty gate unattainable is also the natural principle.

**Question:** The *Book of Documents* says: "The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle." Are the human heart and the Dao-heart necessarily two different things?

**Answer:** Perilous is movement; subtle is stillness. When the human heart is still, it is the Dao-heart. When the Dao-heart moves, it is the human heart. It is but a single heart—through movement and stillness it is divided into perilous and subtle.

**Question:** The Way of heaven and earth—must it not depart from movement and stillness?

**Answer:** The Supreme Ultimate establishes heaven and earth through movement and stillness. For every odd there is an even; for every host there is a guest. The Three Powers and the myriad things cannot for a moment depart from movement and stillness. What can depart is not the Way.

**Question:** Why does the Way necessarily emphasize stillness?

**Answer:** Because of the functioning of the Three Powers and the myriad things, the utmost Way emphasizes stillness.

**Question:** Does the Way of utmost stillness, in relation to the movement and stillness of the Three Powers and the myriad things, have separation or union?

**Answer:** Utmost stillness refers to the original substance of the Limitless. From this original substance arises the wondrous transformation of production and change—it does not mean there is something separate from the original substance, nor does it mean merging with the original substance to become indistinct. Before the two qi of yin and yang sprout, this principle is quiescent and unmoving. When the two mechanisms of movement and stillness intermingle, this principle responds and thus communicates.

**Question:** Movement and stillness do not depart from the two qi—this the world knows. But the utmost stillness that does not move, this I truly do not understand.

**Answer:** Alternation and decline, coming and going—these are the qi of yin and yang. Thus the myriad things depend on them for life and death; day and night depend on them for brightness and darkness. If there were no principle of non-movement in the world, the Way of the sages would rise and fall with yin and yang, come and go with life and death—what worth would it have?

**Question:** Is there a principle of non-movement in the human heart?

**Answer:** The principle of non-movement in the human heart is the same as the principle of non-movement in heaven and earth.

**Question:** Beyond the principle of non-movement, is there another wondrous principle?

**Answer:** To govern the Three Powers and equalize life and death—this is that principle.

**Question:** The Buddha speaks of emptiness of nature; Mencius speaks of goodness of nature; Xunzi speaks of evil of nature; Yangzi speaks of the mixture of good and evil in nature. Is nature not one, differing only between humans and other beings?

**Answer:** Emptiness is the wondrousness of nature; goodness is the root of nature. The others have lost this wondrous root. Nature is what all things universally possess. Humans attain its wondrous root yet do not know how to use it; other beings lose its wondrous root yet use it unknowingly. It lies in the difference between attainment and loss—how could there be a distinction of good and evil?

**Question:** You often say the human body is a temporary convergence. Yet this body of mine has not a single hair that is an external thing—why call it a temporary convergence?

**Answer:** First, it borrows the essence and blood of father and mother; next, it borrows the two qi of yin and yang. In the womb, it borrows the mother’s breath; after birth, it borrows the mother’s milk. The eyes borrow the sun and moon for brightness; life borrows food and drink to sustain it; the ears borrow sound to hear; the nose borrows fragrance to smell; the tongue borrows taste to savor; the body borrows clothing for adornment; the mind borrows knowledge to think; heat borrows wind to cool; cold borrows fire to warm. From the crown of the head to the soles of the feet, nothing is not borrowed. If even one thing were not borrowed, it would not be a complete person. Among the myriad things in heaven and earth, none are not empty and borrowed yet exist. You say there is not a single hair that is an external thing—is this not delusion?

**Question:** Since the body is a temporary convergence, why then are seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, smelling with the nose, tasting with the tongue, grasping with the hands, and walking with the feet—all these functions—mine?

**Answer:** It is like the wooden puppet made by the craftsman Yan: is it not also borrowed from lacquer and wood? When assembled, it takes form; when scattered, it has no appearance. This body of ours, in life, borrows it for use; in death, discards it unknowingly. If it were not borrowed, it would not die when assembled. Since it is borrowed and dies, where is the use of "I"?

**Question:** If the body is all borrowed, what is real?

**Answer:** Not only is the human body borrowed—all things and affairs in the world are without exception borrowed. What is not borrowed is only the principle of nature.

**Question:** If all things and affairs are borrowed, are heaven, earth, and human relationships also borrowed?

**Answer:** All things with form, appearance, sound, and color belong to the borrowed. Though heaven and earth are enduring vessels, they too cannot escape being borrowed.

Human relationships—ruler and minister, father and mother, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, children—along with houses and fields, goods and wealth, servants and slaves, and all daily necessities, are without exception temporary assemblages. While this body of mine endures, these things exist; when this body perishes, they cease to be. Were they not temporary assemblages, both I and these things could be preserved forever. That which cannot be preserved forever—what is it if not temporary?

**Question:** If heaven, earth, and human relationships are all temporary, then by what Dao should one cherish them?

**Answer:** We borrow heaven and earth for their shelter and support, borrow ruler and minister for governance and order, borrow father and mother for birth and nurture, borrow brothers for friendship and aid, borrow wife and children for posterity, borrow fields and gardens for sustenance, and borrow wealth, goods, servants, and slaves for practical use. While I have a body, I am close to them; when I have no body, I am distant. Judging by this, what is not temporary? The world cherishes things—this is how I cherish the Dao.

**Question:** Is the human heart also temporary?

**Answer:** Those who grasp its temporariness see it as temporary; those who grasp its reality see it as real. In all the world, that which is not temporary is rare indeed.

**Question:** The human heart has no form—what can it borrow?

**Answer:** If one reaches the state of no temporariness, then it is not temporary. But if even a trace of emotion remains, or a trace of attachment to things lingers, one cannot escape temporariness.

**Someone asked:** Confucius said, *"If I cannot yet serve men, how can I serve ghosts? If I do not yet know life, how can I know death?"* Did Confucius not understand this?

**Answer:** Ghosts and spirits have no form yet keep their word; life and death follow fate and remain constant. Confucius was not ignorant of this—he simply did not speak of it often in his teachings of worldly governance, lest he confuse the world. When Ji Shi pressed him with such questions, he answered as he did. Had Gautama or Laozi asked, he would not have answered thus.

**Question:** Did only Gautama and Laozi understand life, death, ghosts, and spirits?

**Answer:** That which returns after death is called a ghost; that which abides in life is called a spirit. Ghosts, spirits, life, and death are one and the same principle. Those who deny life and death also deny ghosts and spirits; those who understand ghosts and spirits understand life and death. The enlightened know this—why must it be Gautama or Laozi?

**Someone asked:** You often speak of the impermanence of all things—what does this mean?

**Answer:** *"Permanent"* means enduring, unchanging. All things arise and perish in illusion—they cannot last forever. Hence, they are called impermanent.

**Question:** Even those who cultivate the Way cannot escape impermanence—why is this?

**Answer:** Without exception, this body is a vessel of blood and pus. Youth inevitably ages, life inevitably ends in death. Thus, the sage transcends the body to preserve it—how could they alone escape impermanence?

**Someone further asked:** If impermanence cannot be escaped, why cultivate the Way?

**Answer:** Cultivate my conduct to align with the sage’s conduct. Cultivate my heart to align with the sage’s heart. There is no other pursuit.

**Someone asked:** Among Confucius, Laozi, and the Buddha, who is superior?

**Answer:** Like a physician’s shopfront—its success depends on who opens it. Their hearts are equally devoted to saving lives. I cannot judge their superiority.

**Someone asked:** You often speak of *"the one matter beyond all others, which a thousand sages did not transmit"*—is this not your delusion?

If it is untransmitted, why then speak of *"a special transmission outside the teachings"*?

**Answer:** The principle of this special transmission does not involve scriptures or doctrines. The worldly fail to awaken and stubbornly demand answers from others, unaware of turning inward. Everywhere under heaven—wherever one’s head or face may turn—nothing is not the Great Dao. Whatever is casually grasped is a treasure. To seek further for this special transmission is surely mistaken.

**Question:** The scriptures say that those who awaken may transmit the sagely Way. Does this not mean there *is* transmission?

**Answer:** Only upon awakening does one realize it is one’s own possession, and thus may transmit it to the sagely Way. Without true awakening, what is there to transmit?

**Someone asked:** Can those who maintain a vegetarian fast and abstain from meat attain the Dao?

**Answer:** Fasting is merely the precept against killing. If one eats only vegetables yet does not sever the mind of killing, it is ultimately of no benefit.

**Further asked:** Can upholding the precepts lead to attaining the Dao?

**Answer:** Precepts serve to guard against evil. All sages and worthies attained the Dao through precepts. Yet without severing the mind of evil, it is also of no benefit.

**Someone asked:** When a practitioner of cultivation dies, do they re-enter the womb?

**Answer:** Only when one becomes master of the body will they not re-enter at death.

**Question:** How does one become master and avoid re-entry?

**Answer:** Through lifelong cultivation and realization, with steadfast concentration, one thoroughly recognizes the original nature. At the moment of death, the mind remains undisturbed. Then one becomes master of the body and does not re-enter.

**Someone asked:** Before parents were born, where was this body?

**Answer:** Before parents existed, there was clearly nothing. Only through the union of conditions did the womb form, and the burden of form and substance arose.

**Question:** When form and substance perish, where does this body go?

**Answer:** It returns to the same state as before birth—clearly nothing.

**Question:** If there is nothing, then there is no existence. Why then speak of rebirth?

**Answer:** Fire has no inherent form; wood is its root. Bubbles have no inherent form; water is their root. Humans have no inherent form; parents are their root. How could they not be born?

**Further asked:** Does rebirth exist or not?

**Answer:** Those who act with the mind of beasts will, upon death, become beasts. Those who live with the mind of humans or heavenly beings will, upon death, return to humans or heaven. This is an unchanging principle—how can there be no rebirth?

**Question:** Do *you* undergo rebirth?

**Answer:** If I possess the mind of rebirth, I cannot escape it. If I am without the mind of rebirth, I will not fall into it.

**Someone asked:** Where do you go after death, having cultivated the Way?

**Answer:** I will neither be born in heaven nor descend to hell, neither remain in the Southern Continent nor depart to the Western Land.

**Question:** Then where do you go?

**Answer:** Abiding in stillness, unmoving, without coming or going, pure and originally so, pervading the Dharma realm. With the body of liberated meaning, I am free and at ease.

**Someone asked:** Ghosts and spirits have no form—they appear as mere emptiness. Why then are there ghosts and spirits?

**Answer:** Beings of blood and qi possess form and thought. Wood and stone possess form but no thought. Ghosts and spirits possess no form but have thought. *Form* refers to material obstruction; *thought* refers to latent perception. Though ghosts and spirits lack material obstruction, their consciousness and perception are the same as in beings. Just as a person’s latent thought can dwell in form and linger, traveling ten thousand miles in an instant—whether in pursuit of fame, wealth, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, or grief—all is as if personally experienced. The way of ghosts and spirits is precisely thus.

**Someone asked about supernatural powers.**

**Answer:** The spirit is the wondrous, awakened essence of nature. Among the three realms and the myriad things, it arrives without haste and pervades without movement. It can conceal heaven and extend heaven’s lifespan, conceal earth and extend earth’s lifespan. It enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning. The sun, moon, and stars; wind, clouds, and weather; metal, stone, grass, and trees; mountains, rivers, and seas—among the eighty-four thousand teachings of right and wrong, none can obstruct its spirit. Unhindered in all directions, it is called *tong* (penetration). This can be known through inner realization, but is difficult to exhaust in words.

**Someone asked:** Are the principles of the Golden Elixir and Buddha-nature the same or different?

**Answer:** Though the Buddha entered through the nature school, he never departed from the life school. How do we know this? The Buddha’s teachings always begin in the East and circulate through the ten directions. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* repeatedly enumerates tens of distinctions—five celestial numbers and five terrestrial numbers. The fifty-three spiritual advisors visited by Sudhana, including himself and Vairocana, total fifty-five—does this not correspond to the numbers of heaven and earth? Moreover, the *Lotus Sūtra* speaks of two Buddhas in one stupa. The dragon girl transforms and becomes a Buddha in the South—*dragon* is *qian* (☰), *South* is *li* (☲). Is this not *qian*’s middle yin becoming *li*? Transforming from female to male—is this not *kun*’s (☷) middle yang becoming *kan* (☵)? The wonders of *qian*, *li*, *kun*, and *kan* are subtly concealed within. Further examples: the four-line verse and the one form; the two honored ones; the twin trees of the twin forests; the two adornments and two wisdoms; the swastika on the chest; the twin wheels on the feet. Are these not all expressions of the interpenetration of nature and life? From this, we know that Buddha-nature is no different from the Golden Elixir. Those who claim the Buddha belongs solely to the nature school are merely shallow scholars of inferior understanding.

**Someone asked:** Does the cultivation and nurturing in Chan practice also align with the Golden Elixir?

**Answer:** The Chan school takes awakening as its principle. Those of the highest capacity attain Buddhahood in a single awakening. Without traversing paths or engaging with yin and yang, where mind and action cease, and words and speech are cut off—this is the pure wonder of true emptiness. This is the supreme vehicle, difficult for lesser learners to reach. The method of Chan sitting in silent contemplation is roughly similar to fetal breathing and breath retention, and its nurturing is not far different. Moreover, the Chan school has the matter of "after the barrier is opened," such as a minister bowing to the emperor or a child approaching the father—this is the wonder of a single pulse with dual perfection, the same as the principle of return and reversal in the Golden Elixir.

**Question:** What is the difference between "true emptiness" and "stubborn emptiness"?

**Answer:** "True emptiness" refers to the mysterious, numinous, and unobstructed. "Stubborn emptiness" refers to dead ashes and withered wood. Stillness without movement is the essence of true emptiness; responsiveness without obstruction is its function. As for stubborn emptiness, it is a thing of annihilation, devoid of nature, lifeless and inert.

**Question:** The Buddhist school exhaustively discusses emptiness and nothingness, asserting that the four elements, six senses, consciousness, and perception are not truly ours. Then what is the Dao?

**Answer:** Before our parents were born, this form did not exist. After birth, the six senses and four elements arose, and with them, consciousness and perception. All that constitutes this body is illusory, a temporary aggregation. Observing its origin, it was fundamentally nonexistent—this is not mere rhetoric from the Buddhist school. Their exhaustive discussion of emptiness and nothingness aims only to align the essence of the heart-mind with the great void, ensuring not even a thread of worldly burden clings to it. This is their Dao.

**Question:** Is the supreme Dao of the Golden Elixir the same?

**Answer:** The Dao of the perfected immortals is no different. Laozi said: *"Observe emptiness as empty; the emptiness of emptiness is empty. When what is emptied is nonexistent, even ‘nothing’ is nonexistent."* What could be more extreme in emptiness and nothingness than this?

**Question:** The *Heart Sutra* says, *"Illuminating and seeing the five aggregates as empty."* Does the practice of the Elixir reach this state?

**Answer:** The first line speaks of *"Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva."* *"Observing"* means reflecting inwardly upon the heart-mind, free and at ease. Next, *"illuminating and seeing the five aggregates as empty"*—at the moment of observing the heart-mind, one directly perceives that the five heaps of this body are utterly empty, leaving only a single spark of original yang wisdom, luminous and unwavering. These two lines are beyond the reach of heavenly and earthly paths, revealing the Buddhist school’s mastery. For *"observing"* is concentration, and *"illuminating"* is wisdom. All sages and worthies attain the Dao through observation and illumination. How could the method of the Elixir be otherwise? This is indeed the Dao of the perfected immortals.

**Golden Elixir Verses**

The Returned Elixir is nothing but true gold and fire;
Gold is original essence, fire is the heart-mind.
Spirit-fire and essence-gold refine each other,
True gold melts into fire, fire fuses with gold.

If fire blazes too fiercely, the gold’s qi dissipates;
If gold is stubborn and fire cold, harmony is hard to achieve.
Within the crucible, the radiance of gold and fire ever abounds—
A single grain of numinous elixir never withers.

Mercury is spirit, lead is qi;
Qi and spirit originally precede the Great Nothing.
One must gather them from the root-source of heaven and earth,
And refine them in the suspended crucible.

The five metals and eight minerals are all mundane things;
Herbs and trees, roots and stems, have form and substance.
To recognize the Returned Elixir as a formless medicine,
Refine it from the heart-mind.

Take one’s own heart-mind as the crucible,
Use original spirit to enact the Great Return.
Refine a crucible of heaven-and-earth’s marrow,
Ever manifesting the cold radiance of precious light.

Do not seek among the Three Powers or Eight Trigrams,
Nor trace gold and fire to their year of birth.
Know that this medicine precedes heaven and earth,
Existing before the Three Powers and Eight Trigrams.

People are the ancient and modern seekers of the medicine,
Yet few find it, for it is not merely sought by man.
Though gold and fire fill heaven and earth,
Without the human heart-mind, where could they reside?

The primordial qi is my qi,
My original spirit is heaven-and-earth’s spirit.
Heaven, earth, and my spirit are of one body—
Wondrously, a single qi turns the great potter’s wheel.

Elixir verses number in the thousands and tens of thousands,
But without understanding the Mysterious Female, discussion is futile.
If one is a hero of numinous spirit,
Dragon, tiger, tortoise, and snake are swallowed in a single gulp.

The fire-timing may as well be told to you:
The crow of Kan and the hare of Li must be balanced.
With heart at ease, intent settled, and spirit unified,
The tiger roars and dragon sings—heaven and earth are spring.

The hare chases the golden crow into the sea gate,
The crow follows the hare’s spirit up Kunlun.
In an instant, the fire-timing circles heaven and earth—
Who in the world recognizes the original source?

When the seven emotions are stilled and the heart-mind untainted,
The five qi gather at the origin, and intent does not arise.
At the double-eight gate, one must bathe;
A ball of harmonious qi levels the two arcs.

The black dragon’s pearl is nurtured in the bosom,
The heavenly treasure held in the hand.
In a blink, never forget constant vigilance—
A single cycle of celestial fire gives birth to the infant.

The fire-timing originally is only the heart-mind;
When the heart-mind is focused, qi is warm and bright.
Concentration’s waves and wisdom’s torch aid each other—
The great medicine and Returned Elixir form in an instant.

People today do not recognize the root of fire,
Falsely transmitting reckless methods of civil and martial timing.
This fire originally has no qi or timing,
Vastly pervading the Dharma Realm across the three thousand worlds.

When the root of discipline is pure and free of dust,
The waves of concentration’s water settle, and the moon of wisdom shines.
Alone, it illuminates, ever luminous and unwavering—
The Returned Elixir may be perfected directly.

Discipline severs the hundred evils and removes all wrongs;
Concentration halts dispersion and gathers the numinous.
The lamp of wisdom reverses the illumination of dark paths—
Why fear the waters of the Flower Pool remain impure?

In refining the Elixir, discipline comes first;
To govern dispersion, rely solely on concentration’s steadfast power.
To brighten the ailment of darkness, wisdom’s illumination is needed—
Mastering these three is called immortal Chan.

The iron ox and wooden horse circle the long river,
The stone tiger and mud dragon sing in grand chorus.
The four beasts—where have they gone?
In vain, one waves and calls to the Yellow Dame.

The six bandits are captured and brought to the mercury chamber,
The five aggregates are seized and taken to the lead ford.
Casually moving the original yang fire,
They are smelted into the full moon wheel of autumn’s sky.

The crimson palace is silent, its double doors sealed;
The yellow hall issues commands, guarding the city strictly.
The four barbarians surrender with hands clasped, planting their banners—
Without wielding weapons, the five bandits are captured.

The first arc seeks the latter arc,
The latter arc must seek the former.
The two things never leave the body’s left and right—
A full moon wheel over the five lakes in autumn.

The dragon rides the fire-borne Yang Lord,
The tiger drives the wave-borne moon wheel.
Breath circulates, encircling heaven and earth—
From Kunlun’s summit to the sea’s depths, all returns to spring.

The purple river chariot rises from the sea’s edge,
Ascending the layered towers to reach the Jade Capital.
Passing through the palaces of sun and moon,
It enters the crimson palace and proceeds to the yellow court.

Once the Kan tiger howls by the riverbank,
It lures the Li dragon into the ocean’s waves.
Soaring past the summit of Kunlun,
Every pore and orifice brims with Yang harmony.

Know that the lead body abides in constant stillness,
While mercury’s nature is ever the root of movement.
When movement unites with constant stillness,
The golden crucible’s fire naturally remains gentle.

Seek not the Qian-Kun crucible elsewhere—
The spirit of crow and hare needs no outward grasping.
The crimson maiden and infant nurse at the breast,
The Yellow Matron mediates eternal joy.

The *Yi* is the ancestor of Qian-Kun, crow and hare;
The ancients aligned the *Yi* with the golden elixir.
The Kun dragon and Qian horse cycle in use—
Why fear the divine elixir will not achieve the Great Return?

To master the human Dao is to master the celestial Dao;
To grasp the heart of heaven is to grasp one’s own heart.
The eight trigrams and five phases are all within me—
Why seek further in the west?

The Supreme Ultimate contains the Three at the inception of Qian;
Dividing the body of Qian yields Kun.
Fire dragon and water tiger invert each other—
This is the highest gate of the golden elixir.

Half a catty of gold, half a catty of silver,
Clearly combined, make one full catty.
Seek not between the two arcs, front or back—
Within your own crucible, the moon wheel is renewed.

The mother bears an infant with a head of snow-white,
The father sires a crimson maiden with eyes of ruby red.
A pair naturally matched, beyond compare,
Born together in the same year, month, and day.

The fire’s regimen flows ceaselessly, subtly,
Without thought, without care, the mind free of birth.
From *Zhun* to *Meng*, morning to dusk, the infant is formed,
Golden sprouts illuminate the moonlit earth.

The elixir texts number in the thousands, clearly expounded,
Yet clinging to images and rigid texts misses the mark.
Remember the ancients’ wondrous elixir secrets—
Let them teach you to contemplate the True Void all day long.

Those who fail to recognize the true lead and mercury of the golden elixir
Waste their spirit in blind cultivation.
Sitting for years in thatched huts and grassy abodes,
They deceive the people of the mortal world.

How many have truly learned the Dao?
For they do not illuminate both nature and life.
Only Zhang Ping Shu of Tiantai,
And one who awakened to the Cao Xi’s supreme vehicle.

Moreover, before the Supreme Ultimate divided,
Where was there any awareness?

Should one grasp it thus, the infant is born in an instant.
The Five Phases are ordained by principle, the Eight Trigrams are propelled by man.
Before heaven and earth arose, who could discern this mechanism?
To comprehend is as though uncomprehending, to know is as though unknowing.
Where knowing and comprehension cease—there lies the foundation of the Great Elixir.

The Buddha’s precepts, concentration, and wisdom,
The Daoist’s *qi* and spirit—
The two teachings are not distinct in origin,
All partake of the same spring.

After securing the achievement and settling into mastery,
Moment by moment, report peace.
Should one’s vigilance ever slacken,
The yin soldiers will breach the pass.

The ancients spoke in expedient terms,
Using objects to illustrate the elixir’s method.
Once the true fish and hare are caught,
The trap and snare may be forgotten.

One, two, three, four, five—
The mother of all things in endless generation.
Descending to the root without end,
Yet losing the Great Dao’s ancestor.

Five, four, three, two, one—
Returning to the root, reverting to the Ultimate Void.
The Five Phases inverted and overturned,
The golden elixir is thus attained.

When the heart is still, the golden sprout grows;
When the heart is clear, white snow arises.
When the heart is clear, the spirit-water gleams;
When the heart is settled, the Great Elixir forms.

Sealed in utter stillness,
The fire’s timing flows unbroken.
Where *Kan* and *Li* unite in embrace,
A single grain of the Great Elixir glows crimson.

*Qi* scatters with the heart’s intent,
Essence perishes with thoughts and reflections.
When the spirit is scattered and masterless,
How can it return to constancy?

Sever the heart from the slightest thought,
And the spirit will follow, settling into stillness.
Once all encumbrances are dissolved,
Where then to seek the returning elixir?

Greed, wrath, and afflictions are thieves,
Ignorance and desire, the soldiers of death’s demon.
To seize the golden elixir’s treasure,
One must firmly guard the forbidden city.

Equalize the heart and practice the Ten Virtues,
Hold to the One and extinguish the Three Corpses.
With the manifold expedients of yin and yang,
The divine powers of the Dao may be attained.

When the Ten Evils accumulate layer upon layer,
The host of yin grows day by day.
Dust ever clouds the eyes—
When will the elixir path be fulfilled?

*Fu* reverts to *Lin*, *Tai* arrives at last,
*Gou* and *Dun* bring *Pi* in their wake.
The two eights of yin and yang stand in opposition,
The yellow blossom bathes in opening radiance.

The two solstices are not the winter solstice,
The twin bridges flow as one spring.
Withdrawing lead, adding crimson mercury,
A full cycle of ten months completes the celestial revolution.

*Yi* and *Geng* follow the dark and new moons,
*Ding* and *Jia* await the full and crescent phases.
When the three and five yang forces reach their zenith,
The perfect clarity of the round moon shines forth.

The river chariot first stirs into motion,
Piercing the three passes along the spine.
The twin wheels of sun and moon race swiftly,
Kunlun’s heights are traversed at will.

The golden liquid descends from *Li*,
The yang essence ascends from *Kan*.
*Kan* and *Li* return to the one *qi*,
The waxing and waning moons stand balanced.

The outer medicine is the *qi* of the Great Void,
The inner elixir, the Mysterious Female’s gate.
Pierce the root of the Great Void
With the cave of my Mysterious Female.

The two principles must be clearly united,
The three passes must be truly opened.
The moon emerges from the azure sea,
The sun reddens above the mountain’s crest.

In silent stillness, the true is embraced,
In profound obscurity, the One is held.
Withdrawing and adding, advancing and retreating—
Let none but the heart itself know.

When the two *qi* penetrate the three passes,
The Three Corpses shiver in cold.
The Yellow Hall issues its stern decree,
The Five Thieves report peace.

True emptiness contains wondrous being,
Wondrous being merges with true emptiness.
Emptiness and being fuse without obstruction,
Together returning to the realm of silent illumination.

Dragon and tiger cease their strife,
Tortoise and snake end their toil.
The Yellow Dame, free of intent and wisdom,
Unmoving, gives birth to the Mysterious Pearl.

The body nurtured by father and mother
Is naught but yin’s filth and defilement.
Should the child seek to learn longevity,
There is another true threefold mystery.

Birth and extinction are but ignorance,
The round and penetrating body is originally pure.
Should one know the method of transcendence,
Seek the unborn beyond form.

The unborn gives birth to all,
Extinction is not the true Dao.
Clinging to the separation of spirit and form,
How can one equal the spring beyond kalpas?

That which has form is not eternal,
That which is without emotion knows no final decay.
Beyond things, transcending appearances,
Why cherish the floating dust?

**Edited by Huang Benren of Yishan**

**Two Poems on the Elixir Ancestor**

There is an Ancestor of the Golden Elixir,
Ever abiding within the ten thousand images.
Heaven and Earth are called its father,
Sun and Moon are named its elder.
Master of the spirits of all kinds,
Root of the nature and life of all beings.
Should one comprehend this,
One may speak of the elixir’s work.

To learn the Golden Elixir’s initial task,
Begin first with the Supreme Ultimate and the Qian Dragon.
Xun is the maiden, originally dwelling in Zhen,
Kun gives birth to the infant, lodged in Dui’s palace.
Crow and Hare, Tiger and Dragon form images beyond,
Mercury and Lead, Water and Fire reside within the body.
Who can fathom Geng, Ding, Xin, and Bing?
Ask the Primordial Elder of Heaven and Earth.

**Five Poems on Illusory Existence**

Where was there self before father and mother were born?
Through deluded movement, form first took shape.
The six roots and four great elements cling together,
Receiving yin and yang, called a human being.
Eyes, ears, nose, and tongue each serve their function,
Color, sound, fragrance, and taste all falsely abide.
The body is the dwelling of greed, anger, folly, and desire,
The mouth is the gate of eating, drinking, and right and wrong.
Earth, water, fire, and wind joyfully unite in illusion,
Wife and children, gold and treasure briefly seem dear.
This body borrows the qi of yin and intestines,
When qi perishes, where was this body ever real?
All things in this body are naught but illusion,
Only the single spark of primordial yang is numinous.
Called the indestructible vajra,
Through a hundred refinements, it grows ever more luminous.
All things in the world are but illusory existence,
From the beginning of the prior heaven, they were originally none.
Should one awaken to illusion and return to true nature,
One is a great man in the world of men.

**Five Poems of Admonition**

If the ten evils of body and mind are not eradicated,
Cultivation is but wasted effort.
This is the seed of the six destinies’ wheel,
To seek immortality is but a dream.

Wine, lust, anger, wealth, and craving—
If even a trace remains, the Dao is hard to approach.
This is the mouth of a ten-thousand-fathom abyss,
How many in Jambudvīpa has it ensnared?

A speck of dust burdens the heart, and it is not enlightened,
Half a mote of anger or folly, and the Dao is not attained.
Only when originally there is not a single thing,
May one meet and speak of the unborn.

To eat one’s fill of meat, garlic, and the five pungents
Is called strengthening qi and nourishing spirit.
The arts of nine-and-one yin absorption are but side doors,
All are causes for future hell.

The ancients avoided desire as they avoided arrows,
Or as one shuns a deep pit or a poisonous snake.
If one does not avoid it, one must lose one’s life—
How then can one find leisure to inquire of cinnabar?

**Five Poems on Avoiding Harm**

Bury light, conceal shadow, hide one’s mechanism,
Let not dragon, snake, tiger, or leopard know.
Honor and disgrace are both snares,
How much more when one lacks kin to avoid the Zhou era’s perils?

Fame and profit are nooses around the throat,
Wealth and nobility are like shackles on the hands.
Fortunate is one free from the bonds of throat and hands—
In the depths of mountain clouds, one nurtures the rare and subtle.

Misfortune first, fortune follows—act not,
The blazing power of the halls of might—approach not.
Only bind oneself to the companionship of apes and cranes in green mountains,
Let others laugh at me as foolish.

Worldly toil, inch by inch, is a pitfall for men,
Everywhere, cast aside your weapons and move not recklessly.
The six desires and five properties must be shunned,
Abide in peace, follow fate, and delight in one’s life.

To attain the art of longevity in cultivation,
First learn the way of preserving the body and avoiding harm.
Fish must hide deeply where hooks cannot reach,
Birds must soar high where arrows cannot wound.

**Five Poems on Equalizing Self and Things**

Should one wish to cultivate and learn the utmost truth,
Forget the heart, forget things, forget even emotion.
If the slightest hindrance lingers in the breast,
The ten thousand images, dense and manifold, will never be at peace.

When I forget mechanism, things forget mechanism,
When self and things forget each other, all seems lost.
Birds sing of themselves, flowers fall of themselves—
Who knows the message therein?

The four marks in the Buddha’s sutras must be none,
The three voids of Laozi must coincide.
Life and death, existence and extinction are of one body—
Where then can I seek my present self?

The three powers share one root, things share one origin,
Within the Supreme Ultimate’s vast embrace, who is self, who is other?
I know not even that this body is myself—
From what place then arise estrangement and kinship?

Amid the ten thousand images, the body alone stands revealed,
Body and heart, the ten thousand images—all are at leisure.
The ancient and wondrous secret is not many—
Wherever one is without heart, there is the great return.

**Five Poems on Returning to the Real**

The four great elements, six roots, and consciousness—
Speech, breath, all are not real.
When all is released from the body,
From where then arises this self?

The prior heaven’s Supreme Ultimate originally had no thing,
This form of mine is but deluded arising.
If perception, hearing, and seeing are not grasped,
Who then can bear sorrow, joy, suffering, or bliss?

Heaven and Earth, the ten thousand things—originally not existent,
Dreamlike forms and bodies—all are false.
Only the great, perfect, equal wisdom
Admits no emotion, knowledge, or heart’s knowing.

The wondrous secret of returning to the real lies in constant capacity,
Not knowing the constant, deluded action brings misfortune.
To recognize that ancient and present are one constant body,
Wondrously fuse the ten thousand dharmas in the midst of the midst.

Beyond the body, the real is preserved,
Where there is no thing, the real is not unreal.
When heart and realm fuse in utter stillness,
Only then does one see the original person.

**Five Poems on Shattering Attachments**

When Zhun and Meng have not yet settled dawn and dusk,
I urge men of this age not to speak recklessly.
In a moment’s effort, the elixir may be congealed—
Five years, nine years are but empty transmission.

Grasp the mystery of Qian, Li, Kun, and Kan,
Why labor to circulate the heavens according to the trigrams?
Simply take the single flavor of primordial yang fire,
Refine it to the void before the Supreme Ultimate.

To seek a steed by following a picture is but wasted effort,
To cling to forms and be bound by texts is vain labor.
I tell those who would learn immortality:
At midnight by the sea gate, the sun is red.

Recognize the single true spark of primordial yang,
The five phases and eight trigrams are but empty divisions.
There is a thing, formed before heaven and earth,
Why trouble to seek Wu and Wen?

Easy to speak of, hard to do,
To learn the books of the elixir is not the elixir.
Wearing out straw sandals in vain search,
It is attained only in a moment’s time.

**Five Poems on Teachings and Instructions**

Throughout the dharma realm, all is the great Dao,
Yet fools still seek it in the Great Brahma Heaven.
They know not that the Primordial Beginning’s Floating Black Soil
Is but the inch-long heart of sentient beings.

The ancients provisionally set forth teachings and instructions
To guide the common stream toward the sagely current.
Had the purple paths not been adorned with flowers like brocade,
How would the noble scions have come to vie in their sport?

Cranes cry, phoenixes sing, displaying fine sounds,
Dragons descend, tigers crouch, ghosts and spirits revere.

Seek the mysterious mechanism within the numinous terrace,
Not in silk scrolls or painted wrappings.
Align the texts, seal them with layered imprints,
And in an instant, the imperial talisman takes flight.

If the subtle mechanism of stillness and response remains ungrasped,
The Three Heavens will not permit casual passage.
The world’s practitioners prize the spirit’s essence,
For only through spirit can one merge with the true Dao.

Those who chase mere deportment and sensual allure
Are but deceived unto their ruin.
**Twelve Poems on the Wutong Tree**

O people of the world, awaken!
This rare human form must not be squandered—
Let no time slip by in vain.
The Penglai Isle lies not beyond the inch-long heart,
Yet how many pass it by unknowing?
I urge you: seek the path of longevity early.

Begin your practice now, heed this counsel.
Black hair and rosy cheeks soon fade,
Time flows like a rushing stream.
Wife and child, gold and treasure—fleeting encounters all,
For when the hour comes, what can you take?
Cast aside these entangling cares.

This human birth was a grievous error—
Do not trust the foolish who persist in evil,
While the virtuous reap joy.
Fortunate are those born in the Central Kingdom,
Who hear early and turn to study the mysterious learning—
Be not bound by worldly toil.

O seekers of the Dao, know the truth:
You must recognize the Primordial One,
Not seek it without.
At first, a single qi shaped your form,
Combining yin and yang to birth the ten thousand things—
This body truly issued from the Mysterious Origin.

Mercury is the heart, lead is the qi,
Their union forges the root of the elixir,
Born in the southwest.
Kan and Li, dragon and tiger—all arise from this,
For life and destiny, yin and yang, are but this.
I urge you: attend to it early.

Guard the true origin, focus the single qi,
Nurture the infant within your body
Until the ten-month gestation is complete.
All metaphors fall short—
The great matter rests in the realm of heart and mind.
To seek without is but vain labor.

This golden elixir follows no second Way—
Within a single inch, true water and fire never part.
Before their inversion,
Toil not in their midst,
For breath reaches from sea’s depths to heaven’s heart,
Revealing the treasure of long life.

This elixir’s root must be firmly bound;
Where thought stirs, the numinous elixir flees.
Seal it tight, let no leakage be.
A continuous qi pierces the three barriers,
Turning the celestial wheel to tend the fire’s timing—
The golden tripod encircled by toad’s radiance.

The Dao holds no other:
The heart is master.
Clinging to forms and texts brings only self-inflicted suffering.
Heed the immortals’ words:
Though elixir scriptures speak in myriad metaphors,
They all distill to yin and yang’s two words.
Seek the root’s source.

Seekers of the mystery, hear this charge:
A hundred years of light pass swift as thought,
Blossoms open and fall in the blink of an eye.
If the great cause and karmic conditions remain unripe,
Hasten to awaken, open mind and sight—
Let no false masters lead you astray.

Study non-action, leave the dusty world,
Weave grass for a hut amid green mountains and waters,
Carefree and unbound.
Watch the jade-like ox on South Mountain,
Man and ox rejoicing in their mutual familiarity—
Cast off the straw cloak and blow a tune.

Vast and untrammeled, without contrivance.

Wander carefree, drink and peck at will—
Truly, this is pure peace and joy.
Throat and hands free of fame and profit’s snares,
A thousand miles of lone clouds and wild cranes—
Who understands this state of awareness?

*Five Western River Moon Poems*

The great Dao needs no other thing,
Only the heart’s steadfast practice.
The moment a thought stirs, mercury and lead take flight—
Simply still the mind and focus the qi.
Kill, steal, lust, and deceit must not be indulged,
Profit, fame, love, and attachment must not delude.
A mind without thoughts, a life without affairs—
This is the foundation of the elixir.
The truth, once revealed, is simple indeed.

How many seek trigrams and images without,
Yet fail to turn inward and reflect on the true source?
This body is the very gate of the *Yi*.
Day and night, Kan and Li ceaselessly revolve.

Crow and hare, horse and ox, dragon and tiger—
All are but metaphors for the root.
Before *Zhun* and *Meng* settle into dawn or dusk,
Fix the will and concentrate the mind as the foundation.

With single-minded focus, the Central Palace remains unmoved,
The four directions and four beasts submit as ministers.
Inner elixir and outer medicine merge with celestial truth—
A perfect wheel of the precious mirror appears.

This scene, this moment, this place,
Without mind, without self, without others—
Who knows the original heart?
The profound stillness of the true and constant wonder.

The Śākya’s sutras, vinaya, and treatises,
The Confucians’ records, poems, and books,
Lord Lao’s thirty-six true talismans—
All speak but of the two words: *one mind*.

Once the mind-ground is illuminated,
What need for all the rest, mere dust and straw?
Forget form, forget qi—all returns to emptiness.
Here, the truth is no mere metaphor.

The four great elements compose this borrowed body,
The six senses and five aggregates are yin’s deceit.
Where the primordial yang abides is my true home—
Do not mistake the body’s wild horses for the self.

The inner court’s divine capital must be exited,
Heaven and hell are but empty flowers.
This mystery, so profound and remote—
Who knows its wondrous workings?

*Five Riverside Immortal Poems*

At midnight, the golden crow rises from the sea’s depths,
At the hour of Chou, it gradually emerges from Fusang.
Great brightness turns eastward, belonging to the three yangs.
Vernal splendor fills the courtyard with spring,
No place untouched by its radiance.

Directly ride the river chariot to the imperial palace,
Drink the jade nectar in the Niwan Palace.
The divine water of the Flower Pool bathes the central yellow—
The infant not yet united with the mother,
Earth endures, heaven stretches ever longer.

Seize every month within a single year,
Return in but a fleeting moment.
Kan and Li unite, tiger and dragon commune.
The three flowers gather in the crucible,
In an instant, the divine power manifests.

The earth teems with yellow sprouts and white snow,
Radiance surges east, west, south, and north.
The two strings round and merge, Jia and Geng as one.
The black pearl first emerges from the water,
Its flame and wisdom naturally consume the void.

Shatter this yang furnace and yin crucible,
Leap beyond black mercury and red lead.
Tortoise and snake, dragon and tiger—all empty words.
The six roots and four great elements,
Yin’s illusions—cast them all aside.

There is a natural, true, singular essence,
Neither heart nor kidney nor mystery.
It cannot be transmitted by mouth, intent, or perception.
To reach the elixir’s perfection thus,
Is to be called a Great Luo Immortal.

Absorb qi, swallow essence, ingest the seven luminaries,
Store thoughts to transform the three vehicles.
Fly the Big Dipper, spray water, scatter blossoms.
Diligently compose verses to present,
Recite and sip the flowing rosy clouds.

What concern have external affairs with the inner realm?
How distant are the labors of contrivance!
Though you perform blessings like grains of sand,
Without perceiving the mysterious female aperture,
You remain as far as heaven from earth.

To study the Dao, first clarify the seal of the heart-ground,
Then must yin and yang proceed as one.
If you cannot extend it to others but only to yourself,
The lesser vehicle lacks wisdom—
When will the Great Dao ever be achieved?

One kind of arrogance boasts of self-mastery,
Spouting delusions to bewilder human feelings.
Seeking only to gain profit and fame,
Never pondering the suffering of birth and death,
Through ten thousand kalpas, the path remains dark and obscure.

**[Quatrain]**
On the eighth night, I dreamed and gained two lines.
Awakening, I savored them—
they were the wondrous sleeves of the golden elixir.
Could this not be the Supreme teaching me?
With reverence, I completed them into a verse:

Pavilions beyond heaven suspend sun and moon,
Within the body, the qi’s majesty stuns autumn’s brilliance.
*(Lines from the dream.)*

The immortals’ wondrous formula—none comprehend it,
By the red smartweed at the river’s head, the Chu waters flow.

**Two Poems on Inferiority**

In the renowned garden, flowers just now vie in fragrance,
The golden phoenix first carries them into emerald haze.
Alas for the bees and butterflies circling the fence—
In vain they flutter near the vegetable blossoms.

The tavern’s jug and the poet’s chant,
Year after year, never fail the heart that delights in flowers.
Yet none know spring lingers on the plum’s branches—
All vie to seek it among coarse peaches and vulgar plums.

**By the Recluse of Mount Yang**

One move strikes the moment like swift thunder,
At the sea’s gate, mist and fog part at once.
Though waves and billows stretch ten thousand miles,
Without the black pearl, he will not return.

**The Realm of Mount Yang**

Ancient paths lie desolate, brambles grow,
Long serpents and fierce beasts intertwine.
Mountains deep, clouds dense, streams flow far—
How many travelers dare not proceed?

**Pointing to Reality**

I possess a plot of land,
Boundless in four directions.
It does not lie on high mountains,
Nor on level plains.
Neither in rivers nor cities,
Nor in the center, nor at the edge.
Not dwelling in the human world,
Yet only within the world of humans.
Bought without deeds, sold without contracts.
Stand and contemplate—do not speculate.
When we meet, I beg you to point to the true south,
To show where the true dragon lies.

**Thirty Zen Koans**

**The World-Honored One Holds Up a Flower**
Why stir the seeds of calamity when all is well?
A million in heaven and earth may doubt and guess.
Clearly, there was fear none would grasp it—
In vain, he held up the flower as a laughing go-between.

**Kāśyapa Smiles**
The golden-headed mendicant, most pitiable,
Why did he smile before the old foreigner?
Had he not blinked his blue-lotus eyes then,
He might have mistaken the flower’s holding for a secret transmission.

**Bodhidharma Faces the Wall**
A single word unmet, standing becomes hard,
Facing the wall, he deceived himself with years of suffering.
At Shaoshi, he casually tossed the ladle’s water—
To this day, the four seas churn with waves.

**Nánquán Slays the Cat**
A hundred mouths like hammers, yet none spoke,
One blade, two segments—souls dissolved.
Who beneath the groves of a thousand ages
Will avenge this cat’s wrong?

**Línjì Enters the Gate and Shouts**
The shout like thunder, all hibernating creatures startled—
Who knew it could raise the dead and restore life?
Silver mountains and iron walls, layer upon layer of barriers,
One sword in the void levels them all.

**Déshān Enters the Gate and Strikes**
The mountain vine truly does not yield to the oak,
Brandished, it slays the hero’s embryonic soul.
Even if his whole body were hands to submit,
Each blow would still leave its mark.

**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: Does a Dog Have Buddha-Nature?**
Zhàozhōu says: No.
From the first, birth and death are unrelated,
Yet with Buddha-nature, one knows becoming Buddha is hard.
Even to say "no" is still not permitted—
Clearly, like a sword unsheathed in empty space, it chills.

**Bājiāo Says: If You Have a Staff, I Will Take Your Staff. If You Have No Staff, I Will Give You a Staff.**
Old and feeble, Bājiāo stirs doubts,
Deceiving with giving and taking, with and without.
Though his capture and release display skill,
How does it compare to a time when weapons are still?

**Zǐhú, Whenever He Sees a Monk, Shouts: Look at the Dog!**
The monk turns his head, and the master returns to the abbot’s quarters, shutting the door.
A single shout—"Look at the dog!"—and he turns in haste,
Biting through, his whole body flows with blood.
Had he not shut the door upon returning,
Would such agony ever cease?

**A Monk Asks Xiǎnzǐ: What Is the Meaning of the Western Patriarch’s Coming?**
Xiǎnzǐ says: The wine table before the spirits.
Clearly pointing to the wine table,
He directly breaks open the highest barrier.
How many who beg for blessings and seek fortune
Are constantly deceived by ghosts and spirits?

**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: What Is the Meaning of the Western Patriarch’s Coming?**

**Zhàozhōu Says: The Cypress in the Courtyard**
The cypress stands tall in the cold green,
No neighbor to plum’s jade or bamboo’s luster.
Its solitary grace rises naturally apart—
How many travelers take it for mere scenery?

**Layman Páng Asks: Who Is the One Who Does Not Keep Company with the Myriad Things?**
Mǎzǔ says: Wait until you can gulp down the waters of the Western River in a single breath, then I will tell you.
Alone it reveals itself, ever pervading the great void,
Eyes aslant, nose straight—a donkey’s mug.
Even if you could drain the Western River in one gulp,
Still, no one could ever be its companion.

**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: Did You Personally Meet Nánquán?**
Zhàozhōu says: In Zhènzhōu, they sell large fortune-telling millet cakes.
Meeting by chance on the road, words are soon done,
Clouds drift, mountains stand, waters ever flow.
For you I point directly, without detour—
The fortune-telling millet cakes clearly come from Zhènzhōu.

**Xuánshā Sends a Letter to Xuěfēng; When Xuěfēng Opens It, There Are Only Three Blank Sheets of Paper**
Xuěfēng says: A true connoisseur, a noble one—though a thousand *li* apart, the wind is the same.
A true connoisseur, a thousand *li* away, shares the same wind,
Three blank sheets from start to finish—utterly empty.
Do not say Xuěfēng ever missed the mark—
Like lotus threads drawing an elephant, it enters the pass.

**Shǒushān Holds Up a Bamboo Stick and Says: Call It a Bamboo Stick and You Cling; Do Not Call It a Stick and You Turn Away. What Would You Call It?**
Holding it up, one knows both fail to hit the mark,
To say it is neither clinging nor turning away is still hard to accept.
Beyond the tip of the pole, there is another way to hook the fish—
What care if reeds are red or smartweed blooms?

**A Monk Asks Línjì: What Is the True Person of No Rank?**
Línjì says: What is the true person of no rank? A dried shit-stick.
The true person of no rank—a dried shit-stick!
How many truly know gratitude for this?
Peace is established by the general,
Yet the general is not allowed to see peace.

**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: The Myriad Things Return to the One; Where Does the One Return?**
Zhàozhōu says: When I was in Qīngzhōu, I made a cloth robe that weighed seven *jīn*.
Scattered and vast, the ten thousand streams rush together,
Yet when gathered, not even a hair’s breadth is filled.
Pitiful is old Zhàozhōu, with no place to hide—
He simply says the robe from Qīngzhōu weighed seven *jīn*.

**Ruìyán Calls Out to Himself as Master; He Answers Himself**
He says: Stay alert! From now on, do not be deceived by others.
Calling and answering—so much pretense,
Even when roused to alertness, one is still deceived.
The yellow bird cannot bear to be heard in sorrow,
The green willow simply faces the rain.

**A Monk Asks Mañjuśrī: How Many Are the Assembly?**
Mañjuśrī says: Three and three before, three and three behind.
Three and three before, three and three behind—already manifest,
Yet how many mistake it for the fixed pointer of a scale?
The moon the ancients saw is the moon of today,
The moon of today once shone upon the ancients.

**Yán’guān Asks His Attendant to Fetch the Rhinoceros-Horn Fan; The Attendant Says It Is Broken**
Yán’guān says: If the fan is broken, then give me back the rhinoceros calf.
Striking the grass to startle the snake—was it by chance?
Alas, the missed step makes words hard to round out.
Had he then fetched the rhinoceros calf,
He would have simply led Yán’guān by the nose.

**Dānxiá Burns a Wooden Buddha; The Abbot Scolds Him**
Dānxiá says: I am burning it to obtain relics.
The abbot says: How can a wooden Buddha yield relics?
Dānxiá says: If there are no relics, then I will burn two more.
Burning the wooden Buddha, the warmth is the same—
Pitiful, the abbot deceived by him.
Had there been no fire in the stove that day,
How could Dānxiá have escaped the night’s cold?

**As Soon as Mǎzǔ Ascends the Hall, Bǎizhàng Rolls Up the Mat Before Him; Mǎzǔ Immediately Descends His Seat**
Before the connoisseur speaks, he already knows,
Clouds rise over South Mountain, and rain follows.
Rolling up the mat—nothing remains—
Like gulls and the sea, both forget their devices.

**Yàoshān Climbs the Mountain, Gazes Afar, and Suddenly Laughs Loudly; Fifteen *Lǐ* Away, the Villagers Hear His Laughter**
Alone he ascends the peak, his heart suddenly opened,
A long wind sweeps the Milky Way, scattering the dust of clouds.
Had he not seen the face of the Moon Goddess,
How could his laughter have startled the world?

**Mǎzǔ Sits in Meditation; Nányuè Grinds a Brick Before Him**
Mǎzǔ asks: What are you doing?
Nányuè says: I want to make a mirror.
Mǎzǔ says: How can a brick become a mirror?
Nányuè says: If grinding a brick cannot make a mirror, then sitting in meditation cannot make a Buddha.
Mǎzǔ awakens.
Was there no reason for grinding the brick into a mirror?
It shook the southern neighbor and startled the northern one.
Try lightly tossing the play-ball—
The golden-maned lion flips over at once.

**The Sixth Patriarch Says: It Is Not the Wind, Not the Banner—It Is Your Mind That Moves**
The true mechanism does not move, the principle naturally fuses,
Ears observe, nose peers—eyes as if deaf.
Wooden men, flowers, birds—no obstruction at all—
Let the wind and banner dance freely in the vast sky.

**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu About the Cold Spring of Gǔjiàn**
Zhàozhōu says: Bitter.
The monk asks: What about those who drink it?
Zhàozhōu says: They die.
The cold spring’s taste is extraordinarily bitter and poisonous—
Who would risk their life to drink it?
Do not blame Zhàozhōu for speaking so harshly—
Since ancient times, good medicine has always been bitter to the mouth.

**The Buddha’s Birth**
Clutching a branch, from the right side he emerges in the blue grove,
No sooner born than his whole body is a root of poison.
Had there been no water from the nine dragons’ mouths,
How could this karmic soul ever be washed clean?

**The Buddha’s Nirvāṇa**
That day, in the twin śāla grove, he concealed his body,
Instantly, the world’s calamities and chaos were stilled.
Who knew the wildfire could not burn it all away—
One by one, the spring winds blow, and it revives again.

**The Patriarch Comes from the West**
Crossing rivers and mountains, the years uncounted,
Alone he brings the robe and bowl to the southern land.
The patriarch’s intent from the West is in every household—
Why trouble to transmit the poisonous medicine outside the teachings?

**The Single Sandal Returns West**
The robe and bowl, the Dharma-matters, entrusted to Shén’guāng,
The stone horse turns back on the road—his plans run long.
Awakening from the spring dream before the mountain of forgotten ears,
He divides the single sandal and returns home.

**Twenty-Four Poems of the Mysterious Origin**

**The Primordial Heavenly Worthy Hangs a Precious Pearl**
A pearl like a millet grain, suspended in the empty mystery—
Countless humans and devas are deceived by their eyes.
They do not see the Jade Capital so near,
But follow the wind and rain out of the Hangu Pass.

**The Countless Multitudes All Enter the Precious Pearl**
Gathering heaven and earth into a painted scroll,
East, west, south, north—nothing remains.
Travelers, do not seek the road to Cháng’ān—
Within a single square inch lies the imperial capital.

Once entered the pearl’s mouth, none know their whereabouts.
Treading the Mysterious Pass, step by step deeper—
All is clearly nothing, and the heart is void.
I think of him only on the autumn river,
Where moonlit reeds and blossoms—where to seek?

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy completes his sutra within the pearl.
Wind-clear and moon-bright, ever as they were—
Who spoke, who heard, in what distant year?
If you ask what transpired beneath the pearl,
A mud ox bellows at the moon, descending the long river.

The Dharma-matters roughly concluded, the hosts of heaven resume their places.
Wind and clouds gather and scatter within the pearl,
Whispers of homeland stir deep longing.
Turning back, where are the old friends?
Green mountains remain, white clouds atop the peaks.

In a fleeting instant, silence—no trace left.
Auspicious signs unfold, revealing the family’s virtue—
A million humans and devas gaze upward as one.
Suddenly the six dragons cease their dance—
Where now to seek the numinous power?

The Venerable Lord of the Dao says:
“The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.”
The nameable and speakable are not eternal—
Cease heeding the bystanders’ chatter of short and long.

The wondrous song originally has no melody,
No need to laboriously judge its notes and tones.

“Nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.”
Above, no further hues; below, no abyss—
Serene and empty, the void follows nature’s course.
If you grasp this state at this moment,
How wondrous!—the Supreme Ultimate before its birth.

“Named, the mother of the myriad things.”
Vast and unchanging, no going or returning—
Creation’s work has ever been without cause.
Only because of this mother of all arising
Do ghostly faces and divine heads appear in myriad forms.

“Mysterious and again mysterious, the gate of all wonders.”
The path to Peach Blossom Spring fades into the distant haze,
Travelers gaze wistfully toward the clouds and mist.
Who knows that beyond the layered mountains and waters,
Without traversing the journey, one arrives home?

“The valley spirit does not die.”
Its numinous radiance chills past and present—
Who recognizes the Heavenly Root, the upward Pass?
The kalpa-fire blazes unharmed,
Indifferent to birth and death.

“The infant not yet a child.”
The Wood Maiden carries the embryo at the right time,
No knowledge, no perception—yet wondrous indeed.
Soft as jade cream, round as the moon,
Its grace known only to itself.

“Not knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune.”
To whom can this grace be spoken?
The fragrant heart is known only to the Jade Lord.
Pitiful, the palace grass grows green year after year—
Why does the noble scion never return?

“I know not its name; I forcefully call it the Dao.”
Ever since moving my home into the emerald haze,
No calendars mark the passing years.
Peach red, plum white, rose-purple—
Ask the Lord of Spring, and he knows nothing.

“There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.”
Forcibly given names, idly passed down—
A thing clearly exists, yet is fundamentally none.
The finest painter’s brush cannot capture it,
Laughing at those who trace the gourd’s outline.

“Know the white, guard the black.”
Cast the fishing line and let it rest—
Who can long hold the bamboo pole aloft?
The old fisherman covets the moon in the river’s heart,
Stirring waves of eternal sorrow.

“The Dao gives birth to the One.”
Two, three, four, five—let them be,
A million threads tangled like hemp.

Seeking it where it arises—
who knows its birthplace has no home?

Departing all extremes,
this is called the wondrous Dao.

Amid the ten thousand forms, it alone reveals itself,
not admitting even a hair’s intimacy.
Others seek the marvel beyond extremes,
but even after donkey’s years, it remains unreal.

When the three are awakened,
only emptiness is seen.
Mind, form, thing—all fundamentally empty;
even clear awakening cannot be grasped.

Do not call emptiness annihilation—
it constantly reveals itself in the great void.

Seen yet unseen, it is called *xī*;
heard yet unheard, it is called *yí*;
grasped yet unattainable, it is called *wēi*.

Li Si’s deluded heart conjures phantom demons;
Zhang San’s ailing eyes see flowers in the void.
From the first, nothing exists to fathom its mystery—
boasting of *xī* and *yí* is but vain self-praise.

Shun asked Ji: “Can the Dao be possessed?”
Ji replied: “Your body is not your own—
how can you possess the great Dao?”

The question is lowly, the answer exalted—
who can discuss the message within?
Their meaning transcends the body’s bounds,
uttered without a trace of artifice.

Nie Que asked Wang Ni four questions,
and four times received no answer.
The mind does not permit itself to know—
four questions, vainly labored over.

Dry wood, cold ash—fundamentally untouched—
where else could one seek Wang Ni?

Nanguo Zicha sat leaning on his table,
gazing at the sky and sighing,
suddenly bereft, as if his companion were lost.

Zijing leaned on his table, sighed to the heavens,
companion lost, emotions forgotten—dumb as a fool.
To know his true state:
the waters and clouds disperse, leaving only the solitary wheel.

The sage forgets form to nurture qi,
forgets qi to nurture spirit,
forgets spirit to nurture emptiness.

Forgetting form, qi, and spirit,
nurturing the mysterious emptiness—this accords with the Dao’s truth.
Wisdom, knowledge, emotions, dust—all laid down—
who then is the original person?

**Miscellaneous Verses**

*Two Poems on Sudhana’s Southern Pilgrimage*
Nowadays, the rivers and lakes make travel hard—
better to return home with lute and sword.
Young sir, you’ve long craved knowledge,
stirring up idle fame across the world.

I’ve always laughed at the boy Sudhana,
strolling through a hundred cities at will.
All those teachings from beginning to end—
nothing but poison poured down the throat.

*Sudhana Sees Maitreya’s Towering Pavilion*
Maitreya’s tower opens at a finger’s snap,
awakening from a dream in Huaxu’s land.
Where now are those billions of adornments?
Sitting in the spring breeze, singing of fallen plums.

*Two Poems on the Dragon Girl Offering the Pearl and Turning South to Become a Buddha*
With one offering of the bright pearl, the deed is swiftly done—
the Dharma King’s commands are fundamentally impartial.
This pearl belongs to all living beings—
why should only she know how to turn around?

Eyebrows painted in the fashion of the times,
a fine maiden from the Dragon Palace’s depths.
Not to present the pearl and seek Buddhahood—
*Bing* and *Ding* are inherently the southern quarter.

*Two Poems on the Twenty-Five Wheels of the* Yuanjue Sutra
Silken threads exchanged—how to repay?
Exhausting schemes, yet never reaching the end.
If you seek before or after the five wheels,
one body still bears another’s sorrow.

Side branches and leaves spawn endless complications—
the straight path has never gone back and forth.
If you’re an unrivaled archer,
why not pierce three barriers with one arrow?

*The Four Great Elements and True Emptiness in the* Śūraṅgama Sūtra
The four true natures are fundamentally empty,
pure and perfectly fused in the dharma realm.
Who says true emptiness is not the four great elements?
Clearly, at midnight, the sun shines red.

*The Buddha’s Nirvana*
The Buddha used birth and death to end birth and death,
enlightening humans and gods about coming and going.
If you think there is birth and thus extinction,
you’ve not yet reached the terrace of nirvana.

*Constant Bliss, Self, Purity*
If you practice constant bliss, self, and purity,
you’re merely adding a handle to a begging bowl.
A single, indestructible dharma body—
not permitted for the multitudes to recognize.

*Thusness, Unmoving*
To call it “thusness, unmoving”
is to mistake it for bubbles and illusory dreams.
Even if you grasp it directly as it is,
clinging to the head of a dead snake—what use?

*The Four Marks in the* Diamond Sutra
Originally, no self, no person—
who then is the long-lived or the living?
When the Immortal of Forbearance was dismembered,
even now, he remains unaware.

*Two Poems on the Four-Line Verse of the* Diamond Sutra
The four-line verse in the sutra’s beginning remains as ever—
seeking it in the scripture only inverts the truth.
If you would only return, you would attain it—
heaven, cease weeping for heaven.

Seeking through sound, seeing through form—this is the deviant path;
knowledge and emotions deepen the error.
Dwelling in the White Cloud Peak—
why wear out straw sandals in search?

*The Fish Basket Guanyin*
Barefoot, robes lifted, she emerges on the shore,
a basket in hand, carrying a living golden fish.
Who knows the price of this fish?
Only the old master of Dragon Gate.

*Lingzhao’s Daughter*
At the crossroads, selling bamboo sieves—
what use are sieves? Who knows?
Daily necessities no one wants—
why teach your child to sell them?

*Budai the Lay Monk*
Budai drags his sack into the marketplace,
daily playing the madman in the streets.
If someone asks his purpose in coming from the West,
he clasps his hands before his chest and stands forward.

*Hanshan and Shide Laughing Together*
Meeting, they clap hands and laugh—*hehe*—
laughing, “There’s nothing to be done with you!”
Only they know this meaning—
no one else understands the depth of their laughter.

*Zhongli Quan Refining the Elixir*
Seven returns, seven reversals—refining true gold,
seeking the fire’s timing in the double wheel.
The furnace burns no common medicine—
each pellet of the elixir is a sovereign.

*Lü Dongbin’s Flying Sword*
Forging qi into metal, autumn’s chill,
unexpectedly, its power subdues the lords.
After cutting down the six thieves and three corpses,
nightly, its cold light shoots toward the Dipper and Ox.

*Lord Lao’s Blue Ox*
The immortal staff drifts back to the flowing sands,
its divine radiance scattering rainbow hues.
After he rode the blue ox away,
who knows where the bright moon fell?

*The Master Hangs His Gourd*
In the bustling market, he hangs a gourd—
within its vastness, it holds the mysterious void.
Turning his body, he leaps into the idle matter—
I ask those nearby: do you understand?

*Chen Tuan Carries His Lute*
Carrying his lute, he accompanies this journey—
a stringless tune, few can continue.
All my life, I’ve laughed at Zhiqi’s ears—
only able to hear the sound beneath his fingers.

*Can Tong*
The wooden ball, upright and still, rolls without stopping—
hands clasped, stepping on Kunlun, yet not moving.

**Stone Lions with Open Eyes**
Open-eyed stone lions fill the room with spring;
wooden maidens with child await the second watch of night.
The murderous turtle-nosed must be made to die—
the dead waters’ black dragon is bidden to live.

If these four wondrous gates are grasped,
the empty king’s jeweled hall grants you first ascent.

**Departing Illusion, Far from Illusion**
Originally, no illusion, nor any departure—
departing illusion, departing names, even awakening is not so.
Should you intend the illusory mind to rely on illusion’s end,
illusory blossoms still scatter through empty space.

**Interpreting Master Fu’s Verse**
Empty-handed, he grasps the hoe—
things move, wisdom does not.
Walking, he rides a water buffalo—
realms shift, the person does not.
People cross the bridge—
the body moves, principle does not.
The bridge flows, the water does not.
Forms stir, the mind does not.

**Verses on the Nirvana Sutra**
All conditioned things are impermanent—
what does not follow this rule?
At dawn, flowers bloom in crimson clusters;
at dusk, flowers fall, leaving the tree bare.
If flowers are likened to worldly affairs,
flowers and worldly affairs are one and the same.
Such is the dharma of arising and ceasing—
here, none can pass beyond.
All with form and shape must yield,
even the insentient and unknowing cannot escape.
Heaven and earth, the ten thousand things—all thus.
I ask you all: do you understand?

**When Arising and Ceasing Cease**
It must be thus to be right:
vastly, the past ceases without ceasing;
silently, the future arises without arising.
The present, as it is, has already ceased arising—
let it be, whether noon or the third watch.

**Quiescent Cessation as Bliss**
This is how one pays homage.
When meeting a swordsman, present your sword;
not a poet? Then do not offer verse.
Those who understand meet with but a snap of the fingers—
how many can know this feeling?

**Twelve Poems on Dual Illumination**

True wind, true fire, with true water unite;
True earth, true emptiness merge with nature’s void.
This is the primordial true bloodline—
The Tathāgata’s treasury, perfect and all-penetrating.

The primordial Buddha is called Many Treasures;
The later Buddha, Śākyamuni.
Two Buddhas, one stupa originally—
Intertwined in nature and life, without distinction.

The number of heaven and earth is fifty-five;
Good Wealth’s pilgrimage spans fifty-three gates.
Adding Vairocana and the self besides,
Fifty-five in all—harmonizing heaven and earth.

The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* begins and ends with ten,
Aligning with heaven’s root and earth’s root.
From this arise nature and life, yin and yang—
Who says the Buddha’s principle is partial?

Unmoving true emptiness births wondrous being;
Not apart from wondrous being is true emptiness.
True emptiness and wondrous being blend without hindrance,
All phenomena return to quiescent illumination.

The awakened mind, the awakened body—fundamentally illusory;
Nature and life, yin and yang—vainly boast.
When neither being nor non-being clings,
One knows emptiness originally bears no blossoms.

Vastly pervading the Dharma realm, all is contained and fused,
Pervading the three powers and the ten thousand things.
Do not call this school annihilation—
Radiant wondrous being arises from true emptiness.

The true emptiness of wondrous substance embodies sincerity;
Sincere, the spirit is numinous, nature self-luminous.
From non-empty emptiness wisdom is born;
Yet sudden emptiness and quiescence are not the real.

For kalpas vast, the great silence endures,
Limpid and pure, beyond all knowing.
Heaven and earth, the myriad forms—let them be;
The true light of constant quiescence never shifts.

Unlock the five aggregates within emptiness’s lock,
Dissolve the eighteen layers of yin demons.
All dharmas swept away at once—
Ever and always, the great void alone revealed.

Like a thousand lamps in one chamber,
Or myriad mirrors reflecting one another’s light,
Layer upon layer, unimpeded in their radiance,
Not a hair’s breadth moves, yet all ten directions pervaded.

Before heaven and earth, emptiness already was;
From emptiness, being arose—thus the dragon of heaven.
The dragon’s division is earth’s very body,
One pulse flowing through the ten thousand things.

**Ancient Sentiment**

Before the plum is seen,
The mountain is cold, the ravine wide.
Once the plum appears,
Its solitary grace is pure and transcendent.
Three or four blossoms—skin like ice and snow,
Sparse shadows slanting in the dusk’s moon.
Plum, O plum,
Before me, silently without a word.

The sun sinks behind the western hills,
Evening mist just withdrawn.
Ten thousand miles of Chang’an,
Far bathed in clear autumn.
The gulls on the idle sands betray no intent;
The moon newly bright, the waters serene.
Old man, O old man,
Alone fishing from a solitary boat.

Gazing after one departed,
Imagining their voice and face.
To return or not—
Longing surges like a tide.
If by chance they come,
Meeting suddenly, words would fail to plumb the depths.
Person, O person,
Speechless, alone facing the spring wind.

Mountains upon mountains,
White clouds vast and boundless.
You do not return—
Lost on distant roads.
The geese are silent, their cries unheard;
Yearning for one gone, as if in mourning.
Wanderer, O wanderer,
Why not return at last?

Broken clouds, wind-whipped without trace,
White silk across the sky, its brilliance clear.
Silent, all sounds stilled;
Luminous, the lone moon flows through the void.
At such a time, who shares this feeling?
At heaven’s edge, the evening glow crimson.
On the distant shore,
Reeds sway in the desolate grass.
The old fisherman, his line drawn from the mossy rocks.
Sails skim the water like flight,
Empty, bearing the moon homeward.

Trees stand stark,
Scenery declines in the setting sun.
Things scatter in profusion—
Who knows their constancy?
Mountains deep and dark,
Clouds billowing boundlessly.
This longing endures—
Who will gaze back in return?

Evening hastens,
Few are those who, though benighted, awaken.
Walking in restless throngs—
Who can still them with stillness?
Birds fly, fly,
Grass sways, sways.
Rain falls, faint—
My Way is level; who will return?

**Unexpected**

Dull clouds, dense and ungathered,
A long wind scatters them—thoughts drift.
The solitary wheel permits not the slightest hindrance,
Ten thousand miles of sky—one autumn.

**Looking Back**

One thought unborn—principle and phenomena merge,
Like space, fundamentally unattached to space.
Unknowing, unrecognizing—who is the master?
All phenomena return to quiescent illumination.

**Only One**

Ten thousand people, one heart—
Heaven cannot oppose.
Ten thousand people, ten thousand hearts—
Heaven cannot oppose.
The rise and fall of nations—
Who but the heart is responsible?

One person, one heart—
Heaven cannot oppose.
One person, ten thousand hearts—
Heaven cannot oppose.
Self-destruction, wayward teachings—
Who but the heart is responsible?

**Not Two**

The sage’s heart is not two—
Heaven and earth cannot oppose.
The sage’s dharma is not two—
Spirits and gods cannot oppose.
The sage’s words are not two—
All under heaven cannot oppose.
The sage’s Way is not two—
All ages cannot oppose.
One who can always be not two—
Heaven and earth wholly return.

**Mind’s School**

The body is the mind’s abode;
The mind is the Way’s school.
Body and mind flung open—
The ten thousand transformations instantly void.
The ten thousand transformations instantly void—
Thus the mind’s school is restored.
A hair’s breadth of deviation—
North, south, east, west diverge.

**Non-Being**

No Way, yet Way;
No mind, yet mind.
Neither being nor non-being clings—
No past, no present.
To speak is necessarily to negate;
To be silent is necessarily to affirm.
Beyond verbal explanation,
Heaven endures, earth abides.

**Unknowing**

Not knowing, thus knowing;
Knowing is not knowing.
To know the "thus" is not—
Past and present return as one.
Mind and mind’s knowing—
To know is not to know.
Suddenly unknowing—
Can this be called the subtle and profound?

People say I know—
In truth, I do not know.
People affirm what they affirm;
I negate what they negate.

**Not Deluded**

Others grieve, I grieve;
Others laugh, I laugh.
Not opposing worldly sentiments—
Naturally wondrous and subtle.
No need for deep seclusion,
No need for conspicuous dwelling.
No need for solitary awakening,
No need to feign foolishness.
The Way comes—follow its transformations;
Following comes—rectify its transformations.
Between compliance and opposition,
Silently discern the true and false.

Dharma speech, worldly speech—
Worldly speech, Dharma speech.
The two ends of world and Dharma—
Essential to settle their master.
Within and without.

The world’s gold and treasures,
The wealth and honor before the body.
The gold and treasures within the heart,
The wealth and honor within the body.
Worldly treasures nourish the mortal form;
Heart-treasures nourish the sacred spirit.
Worldly treasures end in illusion;
Heart-treasures preserve the true.
The body perishes, worldly treasures perish;
Heart-treasures never fade.
Alas, these two ends—
Only the lord of the heart can decide.

**The Human Heart**

The human heart—
A single moment, it races across the four heavens.
Now like a hawk seizing a hare,
Now like a wind-chasing steed.
Water and fire wheels clash in turn,
Lightning and sunlight shoot through one another.
Frenzied winds stir up dust and sand,
Rushing waves crash against rock crevices.
Battle lines bristle with spears and halberds,
The Milky Way pours in chaotic torrents.
Endlessly swirling, never still,
Drifting day and night.
Not for a single instant
Can it rest in the abode of spirit.
Thus the sages of old
Sought the heart without respite.
Six years, nine years—
Gazing at the heart without pause.
Alas, among all under heaven,
Who truly knows the heart?

**Mount Yang’s Hall-Opening Verse**

Before the meal is done, they leave the hall to seek;
Returning when the bell calls, bowls washed.
If one clings to a single grain,
The Five Peaks and Three Terraces are but dust.

**Verses on the *Vajracchedikā*’s "One Combined Suchness"**

Between heaven and earth,
Each has its counterpart.
Odd meets even,
Yin pairs with yang.
One, two, three, four—forming the whole.
The ancients erred by omitting a single word,
Yet still endured five hundred kalpas as wild foxes.
Modern men err in speech without count,
Their karma a myriad times that of wild foxes.
Those who claim attainment without proof are as sands of the Ganges;
Those who claim realization without attainment are as hemp.
To slander the ancient *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*
Is to make the Three Wretched Realms one’s eternal home.

**Purity and Filth**

A pool of pure water,
Defiled with excrement.
Passersby avert their eyes.
A pool of pure water,
Infused with wondrous fragrance.
Passersby vie to taste it.
Purity delights the people;
Filth repels them.
The two paths of good and evil—
The lord of the heart must weigh them.

**Oneself**

Each person is their own Laozi,
Every one their own Maitreya.
Yet all day they face one another, unknowing,
Year after year seeking outside.
Hurrying south of the river, north of the river,
Toiling across the Three Huai, Two Zhe.
Some guard ancient tombs and grass huts,
Some become mountain goblins or water spirits.
Sitting in dark caves,
Pointing to the spirit of life and death.
Calling this the root of the Great Dao—
Truly, mistaking the thief for one’s child.
To speak of this to those who study the Dao,
Seeing nature is the principle of awakening.
To know, then to unknow;
To awaken, then to practice.
I urge you to ask the skull—
When will it escape the burning house?

**The Dao Is Hard to Attain**

Though the ten thousand methods stretch boundless,
Only the principle of the Heavenly Heart is most balanced.
Winning a name on the golden placard is easily done;
To learn the Dao in the red dust is exceedingly hard.
Not understanding the master of the ten thousand methods,
One vainly follows where the ancients walked.
Of the billions who speak of this principle,
Who among them truly grasps non-arising?

**The Difficulty of Learning the Dao**

A ladder of rabbit horns might yet be climbed,
A whisk of tortoise hair might bear mountains in a bird’s beak.
To seek here is still easy—
Only to still the heart and learn the Dao is hard.

**The Difficulty of Awakening to the Dao**

To abandon rank and renounce kingship is but ordinary;
To burn the body or sever an arm is not yet difficult.
To clarify the principle of no-attainment, no-cultivation—
Only then does one know the difficulty of awakening to the Dao.

**The Difficulty of Attaining the Dao**

A single hair might drain the sea,
A mustard seed’s tip might bear a needle’s weight—easily done.
Mastery of the Three Baskets in five carts is not wondrous;
Nothing under heaven is as hard as attaining the Dao.

**Hard to Obtain**

Barbarian songs and Yue chants fill past and present,
Yet few can harmonize with the Snow Melody.
Today, where is Bo Ya?
In the world, it is hard to find another Ziqī.

**Hard to Practice**

Winding paths twist and turn, impassable;
White clouds and green peaks layer upon thousands.
Travelers gaze in vain from afar,
Who reaches the highest peak of the azure sky?

**Hard to Believe**

The Great Dao is level and smooth,
Yet few among men recognize it when told.
Who would believe, looking back at the homeland,
That the evening sun lingers over wild grass?

**Hard to Speak**

Dark, silent, rootless—
Not dependent on yin-yang or images and numbers.
All marvelous skills under heaven can be learned,
Only this one matter is hardest to speak.

**Four Poems on Absolute Illumination**

Heaven and earth, the ten thousand things—clearly existent;
When the heart is forgotten, the ten thousand things vanish.
Forgetting qi, forgetting spirit, still absolute illumination—
Vast and empty, where to seek the present self?

The slightest thought or worry clouds the heart,
Instantly differing from the original state.
Even the radiant and unveiled is still delusion—
Who knows the Great Mystery’s emptiness?

Recognizing the foundation of the mysterious origin,
From action one must reach non-action.
Not knowing transcendence, one clings in vain—
When the house collapses, the master cannot be moved.

Those of shallow roots and inferior understanding,
Seeing these words, call it "yin-spirit" or "fallen into Chan."
Not grasping the wondrous perfection of the Great Elixir,
Śākyamuni was originally the Golden Immortal.

**Preserving to the End**

Forty years—impermanence presses daily;
Prepare now for death’s arrival.
Willows wither, flowers fade—signs of age,
Duckweed gathers, wealth floats—chaos of the world.
Ancient ways scatter with the vulgar tide,
Youth departs, white hair arrives.
Even the turtle hiding in its shell cannot escape—
How much less should one stretch forth the head to invite calamity?

**Mid-Autumn at Fifty**

Favor and disgrace are but bubbles and illusions,
All seen and heard is empty and fleeting.
The Heavenly Heart rests only in perfect balance;
The principle of Dao returns to the ultimate stillness.
The ten thousand things, vast and boundless, are all delusion;
This toiling body—what more does it seek?
I ask you, moon of the mid-heaven—
How many autumns remain in a fifty-year life?

**The Dao Abides**

Thinning hair, falling teeth—no need for alarm,
For the true heart remains unchanged.
The Dao of old and present never ages;
Only the body’s beginning and end lack long life.
A hundred rivers flow straight to the sea;
A single moon hangs pure in the sky.
Carrying no worldly cares in the breast,
Emptying all possession—this is the constant practice.

**Returning to Reality**

Without awakening, one vainly divides the schools of nature and destiny,
Monkeys fling themselves from trees, fire wheels blaze red.
Such principles must return to reality—
Which human heart is not tinged with emptiness?
Only because dust and toil obscure life,
Has the awakened nature lost its clarity.

**Gazing Serenely at Human Inquiry**

Should one gaze serenely at the laws of humankind,
All worldly laws become as one.
**Plain Truth**
The ancestral lineage never bestowed laws upon others—
Only when hearts mirror one another is it fitting.
Without understanding the principles of yin and yang’s nurturing,
How can one grasp the heart of heaven and earth’s creation?
Though the Three Powers are divided into high and low,
A single pulse has never been severed through ancient and modern times.
This is but plain and evident truth—
Why seek it east or west?

**Quiet Contemplation**
In quiet sitting, examine closely:
What in this world is short, and what is long?
From ancient times to now, all share the same heaven and earth,
Yet dynasties succeed one another, how many emperors have there been?
Inch by inch, the land becomes a battlefield;
Field by field, the grasses and trees vie in the arena of fame and gain.
All ten thousand transformations rush by as emptiness—
Only the original heart remains unchanged.

**Fundamentally the Same**
Confucianism and Daoism, revered for their wisdom in the world,
Share the same primordial pulse.
Learning must reach subtlety before words can convey;
Awakening to the true mechanism, principles naturally merge.
Governing the world, how can one forget great righteousness?
Joyful harmony must reach the mysterious void.
How many are needlessly vexed by cleverness—
Facing life and death, they remain obstructed.

**No Contention**
Since all waters must flow toward their source,
Only unity and purity hold fast to the center.
The Three Teachings need not oppose one another—
The One Origin ultimately returns to harmony.
The *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* are indeed the foundation of human relations,
While Buddhism and Daoism can fathom the workings of creation.
Within this, why debate right and wrong?
A single household’s gate opens to ten thousand families.

**Certainty**
Amid the haste of daily exchanges,
The master differs from the multitude.
Like floating clouds and flowing water, the heart knows no rivalry;
After the rain, the moon’s light and wind’s clarity merge of themselves.
Once settled, life’s arising is not true principle;
Upon awakening, what matter does not return to emptiness?
Did the ancients not speak truly?
Only the common and mediocre remain obstructed.

**The Supreme Learning**
Though the supreme learning is said to eschew books,
The teachings still require written support.
The One Origin’s foundation is not truly existent,
Yet how dare one say the Three Treasuries’ texts are absent?
Governing the world must unfold through benevolence and righteousness;
Cultivation must discern the paths of life and death.
Do not dismiss the learning of the heart as mere words—
When awakened to the mysterious void, all are ultimately not distinct.

**One’s Fundamental Duty**
Reading books must ultimately seek to penetrate principle;
Learning the Dao first requires recognizing the original heart.
If principle is not grasped, books are read in vain;
If the heart is not awakened, the Dao is hard to find.
There is no wisdom beyond life and death—
In vain does one boast of brilliance across ancient and modern times.
I urge the people of the world to awaken:
Do not let ease lead to complacency.

**Following Conditions**
In old age, one’s comings and goings are left to heaven;
With whatever strength and time, one forms good affinities.
I do not wish for fame in a flourishing age—
Only to pray for a peaceful end to my remaining years.
At this stage of life, one knows true fortune;
Only at life’s end is one’s existence preserved whole.
Yet I recall the days of captivity—
Who could have foreseen today’s poems?

**Recovery from Illness**
Goodness can avert evil and extend years—
But what goodness should come first?
The native landscape’s radiance ever shines bright;
The moon of the nature-sky remains clear and lovely.
Each day, advance with acts of kindness;
At every opportunity, press forward with good deeds.
I urge the people of the world to apply themselves:
A virtuous heart truly moves the August Heaven.

**Curbing Greed**
A level heart and upright path are sound strategies;
Diligent toil in livelihood surpasses preemptive cultivation.
Though a thousand days of scheming may bring wealth,
A single overturned bowl of water may be hard to recover.
Seek little, eat little, spend little;
Deceive not, covet not, plot not.
This is the way to peace and joy in life—
I urge you not to wait until disaster strikes.

**Flattering Ghosts**
How shameful that people of this age lack self-awareness,
Failing to cultivate good plans from the heart.
Of my kind, how can one bear to deceive and rob?
What merit do ghosts have that one flatters and supplicates them?
Ignoring the suffering of the world’s poor,
Yet in the unseen realm, retribution is swift and sure.
A little foresight in one’s conduct
Outweighs a thousand taels spent on preemptive rites.

**Exploiting the People**
All beings are originally free of affliction—
Good and evil arise from the heart.
Heaven’s Dao is impartial, aiding only virtue;
Human nature, once altered, becomes calamity.
Harming others for self-gain is still greed for fortune;
Using the Buddha’s name to amass wealth.
This is no long-term strategy—
Planting seeds of goodness may instead sow seeds of misfortune.

**Kindness to Others is Best**
Not fearing the law of the land nor the King of Hell,
Yet seeking blessings and long life from the Azure Heaven.
Even if one pushes the heart to give generously,
How does it compare to lending without demanding repayment?
Squeezing fat and scraping flesh for wealth,
Molding Buddhas, adorning gods, staging rituals.
How much better to show a little kindness to others—
Nearly extending one’s own blessings, distantly benefiting one’s descendants.

**Universal Exhortation**
Loving fame, loving profit, loving to delve into the mysterious—
Seeking both Dao and worldly gain.
Failing to grasp the great human relations, like a snail measuring the sea;
Not understanding the true Dharma, like peering at the sky through a tube.
Only with no heart and no things is one in the Dao;
Exhausting oneself and others, how can one become immortal?
I urge the bustling worldly folk:
The King of Hell will one day tally your wages.

**Admonishing the World**
Alas, the cycle of life and fate—
Locked within the heavy gates of the five desires.
A hundred years of life are but a dream;
A thousand schemes and ten thousand calculations are not as good as leisure.
Do not let white hair fill your head;
Even with cinnabar, one cannot preserve youth.
When the time comes, yield to the recluses—
Close your door, pillow high, amid the clouds.

**Few Walk the Path**
Who among the bustling throng awakens to the floating life?
Debating the extraordinary and the mundane, all hasten toward dusk.
All ten thousand forms under heaven bear flaws—
Only water in the world remains free of contention.
The heart, once settled and free of worry, is unburdened;
Principle, when exhausted, becomes self-evident.
This Dao, from ancient times to now, is ever smooth—
Yet how few truly walk its path.

**Four Inabilities**
Water cannot wash away accumulated goodness;
Fire cannot burn the homes of the good.
Thieves cannot plunder the wealth of the good;
Officials cannot confiscate the deeds of the good.

**Four Prohibitions**
In the heart, do not scheme against others’ livelihoods;
In speech, do not speak ill of others.
Behind their backs, do not harm others;
After death, do not betray others’ trust with their wealth.

**Four Equalities**
A level heart surpasses burning incense;
Fair scales surpass almsgiving.
An even ruler surpasses fasting;
An impartial measure surpasses offering rituals.

**Four Inequalities**
With the brush, do not write unjust petitions;
In the treasury, do not store ill-gotten gold.
Before others, do not speak unfair words;
In the world, do not harbor an unjust heart.

**Four Acts of Disloyalty**
Practicing disloyal deeds invites swift ruin;
Scheming for disloyal wealth brings swift dispersal.
Raising disloyal sons leads to swift poverty;
Employing disloyal men invites swift betrayal.

**Four Lackings of Substance**
A heart without true awakening is easily deluded;
A Dao without true study is easily lost.
Principles without true clarity are easily biased;
Spirits without true communion are easily obstructed.

**Four Essentials**
A state need not be vast—only let ruler and ministers be harmonious.
A family need not be wealthy—only let descendants be virtuous.
A person need not be noble—only let clothing and food be sufficient.
Fortune need not be sought—only let the heart’s intentions be good.

**Four Inevitabilities**
A vast state with disharmonious ruler and ministers will surely decline;
A wealthy family with unworthy descendants will surely fall into poverty.
A noble person with excessive indulgence in food and finery will surely meet an early end;
Fortune sought with a corrupt heart will surely bring misfortune.

**Three Great Misfortunes**
A scholar who does not read is a great misfortune for the world.
Monks and Daoists who lose their original heart are a great misfortune for the teachings.
A nation without worthy ministers is a great misfortune for court and countryside.

**Four That Do Not Bring Blessing**
Monks and Daoists who are not true to their calling do not bring blessing to the teachings.
A Dao lineage without a proper lineage does not bring blessing to sentient beings.
Power and prosperity without restraint do not bring blessing to later generations.
Taxes and levies without proper offering do not bring blessing to the world.

**Two Fixed Outcomes**
Now we see evil-hearted people
Enjoying wealth and honor with many offerings—
This is the cause of their past lives,
Now repaid in this life’s use.

The wrongs committed in this life
Will surely lead to downfall in the next.
If you doubt this, observe over time:
Their descendants grow ever poorer.

Now we see good-hearted people
Facing lifelong misfortune and blame—
This is the cause of their past lives,
Now repaid in this life’s suffering.

The good intentions of this life
Will surely not be lost in the next.
If you doubt this, observe over time:
Their descendants rise to official rank.

**Verily**
The wicked die wickedly,
The good die well—
This principle is truly so,
Heard by the ear and seen by the eye.

**Death is Equal**
The poor and lowly cannot escape death;
The rich and noble cannot escape death.
Poverty and wealth differ in two ways,
But life and death share the same path.

**The Dao is Equal**
The Dao of ancient times is this same Dao.

This Dao of the present is this same Dao.
The Great Dao is utterly impartial,
Depending only on whether one awakens or not.

I—ah, I—
Throughout the twelve hours of the day,
Long ago awakened to this principle.
Since then, I have endured hardships,
Now impoverished, now abandoned.
For thirty years I have striven,
Yet none have been my true kin in understanding.
Amid chaos, I have faced near-death,
Yet this path I dared not forsake.
Only upon nearing fifty
Did I at last stand on level ground.

I practice the Three Teachings as one,
Regarding death and life with equal vision.
The ills of the world cannot be escaped—
Fine robes and caps are but fleeting support.
I shame myself for my shallow wisdom,
Longing to meet a perfected one.

My teachers and friends of old
Merely assailed me with differences.
Each exalted their own skills,
Each affirmed their own rightness.
Some called me mad,
Others spoke of what they feared.
Never did I meet a clear-eyed person—
I could only consult my own heart.

Without sages, without spirits,
True gold must be tested by fire.
Who in this world truly knows?
Alas, I weep for myself.

Since taking form,
Since taking form,
I have come to this.

Myriad lives born, myriad lives die.
I and all under heaven share one ancestral root.
All men and women in the world are none but father and mother,
Uncles and aunts, kin and in-laws,
Brothers and sisters, wives and children.
Some as lord, some as minister,
Some as friend, some as old acquaintance.
Daoist masters, immortals, Confucians, Buddhists,
Chinese and foreign, lands exchanged.
Some as foe, some as enemy,
Some foolish, some wise.
At the dawn of the One Origin,
We were truly of the same root and stem.
Branches split, sources diverged,
Roots spread, limbs grew.
Heaven high, earth vast,
Sun races, moon hastens.
The longer it endures, the more lost we become,
Unknowing of our origin.
I know this floating world:
One family bound in kinship.
Why must we, you and I,
Contend for fame and seize for gain?
Turning our backs on kin and kindred,
We wound heaven and earth instead.
I and others,
Live by the same principle.
Ears alike in hearing sound,
Eyes alike in seeing form.
Noses alike in smelling fragrance,
Tongues alike in tasting flavor.
The lonely, the destitute, the distressed, the poor,
The maimed, the sick, the lowly, the base—
Truly, they and I
Are bound across lifetimes in succession.
Beating, humiliation, oppression,
Anger, scolding, cold, hunger,
Seizing, plundering, subjugation, suppression,
Nakedness, driving, urging.
All such afflictions
Cut to my very flesh.
Alas, this heart of mine—
How can it bear it?

**Unreal**
If one does not attain reality oneself,
One cannot teach reality to others.
People inherit this unreality,
And in turn present unreality.
Following the current, they enter the flow,
Delusion and falsehood overwhelm the true.
One dog barks at shadows,
A thousand monkeys become rats.
**Reception**
The Daoist holds fast in heart,
Upholding the precept against killing.

**Reception of Kin**
When kin and friends arrive,
No grand reception is prepared.
Soft-cooked white rice,
Wild greens boiled to tenderness.
Noon meal and evening rest—
Once given, not repeated.
This is the family’s true way,
With nothing amiss or hindered.
Those who understand matters,
Do not complain, do not complain.

**Inscribed at Liangyuan Temple, Moved by the Times**
Born not in Yao’s reign of peace,
How many hardships have I known?
Five years of reform and governance,
Thrice have I seen the clash of arms.
The people toil beyond all measure—
What does Heaven intend?
Amid the thatch, I sigh in sorrow,
My poem done, I scratch my empty head.

**Inscribed at Liangyuan**
Wind sweeps the scroll, moon serves as lamp,
After rain, green moss carpets the ground.
The petty spirits have lost their power, the man is gone—
Falling blossoms and weeping birds grieve of themselves.

**Inscribed at Chongqing Hall**
The first yang wanes, the second yang begins,
Spring reaches the root of heaven at the second line.
At year’s end, the clear wind stirs the willow’s eyes,
The mountain’s chill lingers, rain clears from the plum’s tips.
The Lord of Spring may not favor peach and plum,
Yet spring’s hues must come to the thatch and grass.
From here, the three yangs draw near to open prosperity—
Who says my Dao is bound to the gourd?

**Three Poems on Late Spring**
**I**
Life has passed fifty years,
And now five more have gone.
Twin temples whiten like autumn reeds,
A lone lamp in the night rain.
Eyes dim, I still make out the words,
Heart weary, I neglect my poems.
The homeland lies far, far away—
Who here truly knows me?

**II**
Late third month in Jiangnan,
Petals fall sparse around the trees.
Spring departs like a swift steed,
Time flies with the crow and hare.
Dust stings both eyes,
The self and world—both forget their schemes.
All past affairs are but dusty traces—
One should return on a white horse.

**III**
In this world of men,
A hundred schemes cannot match idleness.
The heart, unburdened by things,
Finds the cosmos wide.
Toiling in dust laments white hair,
While springs and stones love green mountains.
When will this restless clamor end?
Spring departs, autumn wanes again.

**Three Poems on the Joy of Idleness**
**I**
What joy is there in the world?
Only idleness preserves the self.
If one cannot be idle for a day,
Why be a man in this world?
Chasing and striving bring many troubles—
How much better to cut all ties.
Life and death are but a dream,
Wealth and rank cannot compare to idleness.

**II**
Wealth and rank are easily sought,
But pure idleness is hardest won.
I only fear my hair will whiten—
Who understands the heart’s release?

**III**
Wealth and rank are easily sought,
But pure idleness is hardest won.
I only fear my hair will whiten—
Who grasps the heart’s true ease?

**Two Poems on Worldly Estrangement**
**I**
The road is cut off, travelers few,
The mountain high, the clouds deep.
I stand apart from worldly affairs,
Yet the Dao does not bar the human heart.
A hundred years—so brief a scene,
Like an arrow flying past.
Red dust laments swift aging,
The white sun shirks pursuit.

**II**
Late spring—two poems:
Spring departs, turning not back,
Red sparse, green fills the branches.
If the self is enslaved to things,
When can the Dao be realized?

Though spring rushes away,
My heart remains unchanged.
After blossoms fly and wind stills,
Clouds scatter, the moon shines clear.

**Two Poems on Touching Things**
**I**
Gardens and groves shed crimson everywhere,
Courtyards desolate—scenes transformed.
This is but the misfortune of flowers in their time—
Why single out the spring wind for blame?

**II**
Why does Heaven’s work grow weary of arrangement?
Branches remain dry, buds yet unopened.
You only know to pluck and break them—
Is there no one to come and cherish the blossoms?

**Thatched Hut at Lingyan**
I gather thatch to roof my hut near the mountain hall,
Paper for curtains, bamboo for my bed.
Not to flee fame and embrace bitterness,
But to forget the toil of this dust-bound life.
Bamboo draws wind like a green feathered fan,
Pines lift the moon as a night-shining pearl.
Evening mist veils the curtains, rosy clouds drape the hangings—
Such a scene even kings cannot rival.

**Thoughts on the Past**
Wildflowers transplanted by the green willow bridge,
Branches ablaze, red as burning fire.
The old garden’s springtime grows thin,
Autumn winds strip it bare, turning all desolate.

**Sudden Rain**
Clouds mass like iron cavalry, rain pours in torrents,
A thousand miles of mountains and rivers drowned in ink-dark gloom.
In an instant, the long wind scatters cloud and rain—
Once more, I walk the old mountain path.

**Lamenting Disaster**
In the winter of *jiawu* (1294), tenth month of the *Zhiyuan* era,
Thunder, lightning, and freezing rain for thirty days—
The next year brought great famine.
Thirty days of rain in the tenth month,
Thunder rolled across distant lands.
Grain sprouted white ears,
Vegetables rotted yellow at the roots.
The world knows not the ways of old,
Heaven’s seasons too have changed.
The Dao’s mood turns to earth and wood—
I write this to mourn the times.

**Diamond Clapper**
The knowing clap their hands without error,
Chasing echoes and sounds, tangled as hemp.
The Great Being never spoke the hymn—
Who knows where the bright moon has fallen?

**Hemp Robe**
A thousand strands, ten thousand ropes woven into a robe,
Casually draped, clinging to the skin.
Originally nothing—why bind the self?
Recall the moment of emerging into the world.

**Hoe**
Wood for the handle, iron for the blade,
Forged with hammer and tongs.
Though weeds overgrow the temple hall,
With a few strokes, the palm is made level.

**Four Poems on the Illusory Body**
**I**
The city of birth, old age, sickness, and death,
The den of sorrow, grief, suffering, and torment.
A thousand years of toil—vainly spent,
A hundred years of life—a true passing guest.
Silks and brocades encircle a pit of piss and shit,
Wine and meat conceal a sack of pus and blood.
Greedy for wealth, lustful, ever more deluded—
They study the Dao, meditate on Zen, yet understand nothing.

**II**
The illusory body is but a breath,
If the breath ceases, death comes instantly.
In a moment, the body rots, unbearable to smell—
Where are the rich, the noble, the heroes now?

**III**
People only know to nourish the body,
Yet cannot fathom nourishing their life.
The body is a false thing, bound to decay,
But life is the immortal sage of endless being.

**IV**
I thank my ancestors and parents,
For giving me this body—a joy to be born a man.
Not to die by the sword in this degenerate age—
If not now, when shall I cultivate the Way?

**Two Poems: Cease Studying the Dao**
**I**
No seeking surpasses seeking,
Joy surpasses joy—yet joy breeds sorrow.
How many times have I pondered this?
Why not cease studying the Dao?

**II**
Cunning schemes, cunning schemes—laboring the mind,
Greed and delusion, greed and delusion—never turning back.
Affliction upon affliction—endless affliction,
Why not cease studying the Dao?

**Two Poems: Breaking Delusion**
**I**
Wind and thunder drive the sudden rain,
Darkness engulfs the great void.
In an instant, wind and thunder scatter—
All returns to the old emptiness.

**II**
Greed, attachment, delusion, affliction,
Have clouded minds from ancient times to now.
When afflictions scatter in a single morning,
The original heart remains unchanged.

Han Shan and Shi De, Seated Side by Side in Slumber
Seated side by side, reclining head to head.
Between sitting and lying,
they never depart from *this*.
Just *this*—what is it?
Utterly beyond all reckoning.
Let discussion cease—
I shall reveal it to you.

**In Praise of the Buddha**
On the World-Honored One’s day of nirvāṇa,
a silver casket shrouded his golden body.
Burdening even sons and grandsons,
all alike demand gold and silver.
Hmph! From now on, conceal your golden form—
let men of this age know your poverty.

**Ultimate Practice**
Sun and moon shine brightly,
yet drifting clouds obscure them.
The human heart, no larger than a square inch—
how could it not be veiled by dust?
Clouds are the sun and moon’s demons,
dust the heart’s afflictions.
The wise and foolish alike—
great clarity must yield to great obscurity.
Drifting clouds at times obscure,
yet sun and moon lose no light.
Though dust and toil may veil,
what harm do they bring the heart?
Clouds disperse, the Milky Way gleams;
dust scatters, the heart’s essence shines bright.
How could the long night endure?
Dawn must break at last.

*Direct Pointers to the Dao: All Dharmas Return to the One*, Scroll Six (conclusion)

*Direct Pointers to the Dao: All Dharmas Return to the One*, Scroll Seven
Composed by Mu Changchao of Jian’an Yangshan Daoist Abbey
Compiled by disciple Yishan Huang Benren

Ear-Observation
The ancients observed others with the heart,
while men today observe with the ear.
Heart-observation is like golden orchids—
ear-observation like peach and plum.
Golden orchids: loyalty and righteousness never forgotten;
peach and plum: fragrance lingering long after.
Alas! Among all the world’s friendships,
which are not ear-observations?

The Zither
My zither seeks not sound,
my intent not mountains and waters.
Amid bright moon and still wind,
who truly grasps the scene?

Chess
One monk leans shoulder to shoulder, sitting or lying—
fingers toil, the heart labors endlessly,
all eyes fixed on gain and loss.
How much better to sleep long, leaning thus,
all inner and outer mechanisms stilled.

Calligraphy
Unfurl the vast sky as paper,
dip the inverted Mount Tai as brush.
Though the writing shines in full splendor,
how does it compare to the undifferentiated Great Ultimate?

Painting
Gazing at colors, admiring forms—ah!
Pointing out exquisite, priceless details.
Yet within the vast emptiness, a mere speck—
how could you ever paint that?

*Sent to Stone Hall’s Qiu, Daoist Judge*
Herb sprouts left unpicked soon wither and dry,
in the snap of a finger, mulberry and elm turn hoary.
Who would willingly cast off a golden cage worth ten thousand taels?
Escaping the burning house of a hundred years is surely hard.
When the lead furnace crumbles, the golden essence flees;
when the mercury cauldron frosts over, the fire’s warmth grows cold.
Fair scenes all pass with worldly affairs—
ask yourself: on what day will you speak of the Returned Elixir?

*Two Poems Sent to Xu Linggu, on Abstaining from Grain*
Green mountains everywhere offer shelter,
monkeys, cranes, woodcutters, fishermen—all old friends.
Sitting in meditation, walking in mindfulness, worldly burdens forgotten,
hunger fed, thirst quenched, delighting in Heaven’s truth.
Age befits robust qi, spirit, and vitality;
the wonder lies in the even fire of the heart’s field.
If you seek the Great Dao by abstaining from grain,
you may as well try cooking sand for rice—how could it work?

The River Qu
Upon the River Qu, the sun’s wheel ascends,
rising straight to Kunlun to illumine the Valley Spirit.
Fire returns to the Heavenly Root, entering the mercury chamber;
water flows from the Moon Grotto, entering the lead ford.
Heaven rounds, Earth vanishes—mechanisms follow the Dipper;
yin reaches its extreme, yang arises—principles reside in the body.
Spirit and qi return to emptiness, ever silently illumining—
only then do you see the original person.

The Zither
Bo Ya is no more,
Ziqi rarely met.
Alas! Among all the world’s hearts,
who knows the zither’s essence?

Chess
Victory and defeat cannot coexist—
one gain, one loss.
Pity the pure, white heart,
all day long self-wounded by blades.

Calligraphy
Strokes clear and wondrous,
the heart’s intent meets the hand’s response.
Before observing insects and birds,
where did these characters come from?

Painting
White silk like white jade,
skillfully painted with new and old forms.
Yet the silk’s original pure whiteness—
why defile it with cinnabar and indigo?

The Mirror
Inward nature conceals its radiance;
only after scraping and polishing does light emerge.
Face to face, it flatters the gaze,
yet few glance back at themselves.
Though beauty and ugliness show no partiality,
dust and grime can still obscure.
Alas! The mirror’s reflected form—
who awakens to its illusory transformations?

The Brush
Once sharp and keen,
it spread words in mixed odes and hymns.
Who would have thought it would dull to the root,
discarded and utterly unused?
Alas! The passions of like and dislike—
who in the world is free of them?

Ink
The "Lord of Writing" steeped in defilement,
staining a thousand sheets of white.
All day it aids in transmitting texts—
who knows its form gradually pressed?
Why does it bring about its own destruction?
Only because body and heart grow black.

*Three Poems on Lingyan Garden*
All sounds hushed, ten thousand echoes stilled in four empty mountains—
who would share this scene?
Only the heartless moon of the world,
deep in the night, hangs low to illumine the garden’s center.

Clear, flowing waters stir the zither,
yellow leaves drift, paving the earth with gold.
How much wealth and honor lie in mountains and forests?
Most bitter is having no one who understands this heart.

The mountain is cold, the road distant, letters few;
flames blaze in the halls of power, crowds rush to compete.
I have received the true secret seal of immortals—
no need for carriages and horses to reach my thatched hut.

*On Birth, Old Age, Sickness, Death*
Where the golden basin bathes—
uncommon joy at birth.

**Twin Temples Graying**
Swiftly the temples gray, frost and snow age me.
A hundred joints out of tune—ailments cry out in pain,
a thousand autumns part forever—paths stretch boundless in death.
To hold feeling and embrace consciousness is truly inescapable,
like ants endlessly circling—truly pitiable.
Beyond the original true *One* character,
what else does not belong to impermanence?

**The Suffering of Birth**
When form is born, suffering is born with it—
suffering is rooted here.
As consciousness and nature gradually awaken,
desire and emotion accumulate into habit.
In youth, beauty and charm flourish,
while fame and profit know no idle day.
Alas, to labor this heart—
how is it different from a fleeting instant?

**The Suffering of Old Age**
Once-lustrous features differ from former days,
skin wrinkles, the face darkens.
Hair falls, teeth and gums loosen,
eyes dim, spirit and qi exhausted.
Falling leaves in late autumn’s frost,
the fleeting light laments the setting sun.
Alas, the feelings of all things—
what does not reach its extreme in this?

**The Suffering of Illness**
The four great elements fall out of harmony,
qi wanes, blood flows sluggishly.
In prime years, joy and indulgence,
in old age, sorrow arrives at last.
Bitter pain must be borne alone,
moans and groans—who can take one’s place?
Gold, jade, brocade, and embroidery—how wondrous,
yet sorrowful thoughts make one too weary to look.

**The Suffering of Death**
The four great elements part as one,
all conditions are cast aside.
Wealth and honor end here,
where are the heroes now?
The vast wind through white poplars,
the desolate green grassland.
With no return ever again,
for all eternity, tears flow in vain.

**Four Poems on the Yin of Form**
Greed, love, anger, delusion, and false thoughts—
lust, deceit, killing, theft, and deluded folly.
Form, sound, fragrance, and taste—all yin things;
to seek flying spirit is surely impossible.
Fame, profit, love, and thoughts of gods,
joy, anger, speech, song, and laughter.
Earth, water, fire, and wind—no true substance,
skin, hair, bones, and flesh—all belong to yin.
Heavy yin and excessive emotion must sink,
light yang and refined essence naturally rise.
Spirit congeals, qi wondrous, empty and luminous—
in the azure vastness, an empty song summons the Jade Clarity.

Refine the heart, refine the qi, refine the spirit,
refine until pure yang unites with the true Dao.
If even a trace of yin matter lingers,
you will never see the original person.

**Laughter, Laughter**
Laughing *hehe*—
a hundred years of light and shadow pass in an instant.
The two words *impermanence* cannot be detained—
what use is startling wealth and honor?

Laughing *hehe*—
where in the world is free from toil and dust?
In the turn of a hand, youth becomes white hair,
the passing years cast aside like a shuttle.

Laughing *hehe*—
how many living beings fill the cosmos?
This life of labor—truly laboring people,
yet all labor in vain, none understand.

Laughing *hehe*—
who has not been hooked by this laboring life?
I, too, was deceived by it for half my years,
only now have I cast it aside.

Laughing *hehe*—
I alone am awake—do you know?
Fame, profit, sensuality—candles in the wind,
gold and jade splendor—waves upon the water.

Laughing *hehe*—
the path of cultivation never falters.
Buddha-nature and golden elixir are not two—
the mystery lies in how little there truly is.

Laughing *hehe*—
profound and ever more profound, wondrous and ever more wondrous.
Go straight to the primal chaos before the Image Emperor,
seek the undifferentiated mystery of the *Xuanpin* cavity.

Laughing *hehe*—
the three phrases and three mysteries are not the essential.
True lead, true mercury, true crucible—
how could these be mere worldly ingredients?

Laughing *hehe*—
best to swiftly refine in the golden crucible.
Seeking *zi* and *wu* in past years—
no different from rabbit horns or turtle hair.

Laughing *hehe*—
your own numinous elixir radiates jade brilliance.
Simply nurture it with the true fire, gently and steadily,
after ten months, the embryo forms and nature becomes firm.

Laughing *hehe*—
pluck the *wu-sheng* tune on the stringless lute.
Where the iron ox plows, jade mushrooms grow,
the golden crow in the sea’s depths ever returns to shine.

Laughing *hehe*—
no need to abstain from grain or endure freezing starvation.
Mountain springs and valley streams—follow your nature,
moonlit rivers and pine winds—chant and sing freely.

Laughing *hehe*—
clinging to images and adhering to texts—all is demonic.
When you grasp the nine returns and seven reversals,
you are a divine immortal and a buddha.

Laughing *hehe*—
whether cultivating immortality or buddhahood, it is all up to you.
Buddhadharma calls it the *mind-ground seal*,
the Daoist gate provisionally names it the *Yellow Dame*.

Laughing *hehe*—
the six senses purified, the mind-pearl shines.
One thought of *wu-sheng*—the ten thousand dharmas empty,
if delusive thoughts are not eliminated, calamity comes of itself.

Laughing *hehe*—
only the original brightness must always be radiant.
A million elixir classics—all one mechanism,
one mechanism mastered, a thousand mechanisms penetrate.

Laughing *hehe*—
within the body, always wield the sword of wisdom.
Sever the thieves of ignorance and delusion,
the *huachi* nature-water gleams without ripples.

Laughing *hehe*—
facing scenes without a heart—naturally *li luo*.
No need to seek heaven or the Pure Land,
nor are there hells or Yama.

Laughing *hehe*—
no need to wait for the Son of Heaven’s decree.
A thousand pieces of gold cannot buy this body’s leisure—
let golden seals hang as large as the Dipper.

Laughing *hehe*—
the *xuanguan* is not far—who can knock upon it?
The bright pearl in your robe—only you are deluded,
kalpa after kalpa, wave after wave—vainly running outward.

Laughing *hehe*—
how can flowing water return as waves?
Pitiful are those who toil and labor in vain—
how can they be called back? What can be done?

Laughing *hehe*—
weeping, I point: the mountain is high, the water even higher.
I sing this song and laugh at myself—
those who understand clap their hands and laugh *hehe* even more.

**Exhortation to Repay the Ten Kindnesses of Parents**
Carrying the burden for ten months, the body heavy and coarse.
In walking, standing, sitting, lying—
like a dragon guarding its pearl.
Secretly praying to spirits,
begging for sons and daughters.
Parental kindness—
here it begins.

When the time comes to give birth,
countless worries arise.
Life and death hang by a thread,
survival uncertain.
Ripping open the belly, gutting the bowels—
pain beyond measure.
The kindness of giving birth—
even shattering bones cannot repay.

Born into the world as a person,
one knows hunger and thirst.
For the first three years,
drinking the mother’s milk and blood.
Gradually nurtured to grow,
emotions and nature gradually develop.
Without the nourishment of milk,
how could one grow to maturity?

For three years, carried in arms,
only then leaving swaddling clothes.
The child in the embrace—
a pearl held in the palm.
Near water and fire,
beside knives and peril.
Cherished and protected,
still unable to bear parting.

For urination and defecation,
sores and festering wounds,
hands wash and wipe,
unfazed by stench and filth.
Washing away ants and filth,
scrubbing soiled clothes.

Regulating cold and heat as if serving the gods.
Between mats and bedding, should filth or foulness arise,
the child is turned to the dry side,
while the mother sleeps in the damp.
She worries only for the child’s chill,
never asking if she herself is cold.
This protective kindness—
what day could ever exhaust it?

Sweet morsels she spits from her mouth,
while she herself swallows the bitter.
She desires only that the child be full,
never reckoning her own hunger.
Whenever fine flavors are obtained,
she must set them aside for the hungry child.
When the child eats and finds it sweet,
the parents’ hearts rejoice.

She adorns his appearance,
trimming and combing, washing and grooming.
Silks and brocades she holds,
tailoring them into the child’s garments.
Feathers and furs gleam bright,
as his brow and temples gradually grow.
The parents’ affection
turns to ever-deepening tenderness.
Lifting and nurturing, raising and teaching,
her instructions are never forgotten.
Hoping he will become a true person,
she must teach him the proper ways.

When he reaches the age of capping and hairpinning,
he gradually comes to understand the principles of life.
The parents’ hearts
quietly swell with joy.

The parents’ hearts—
their love for the child knows no end.
They divine the land, seek out fields,
broadly amassing wealth.
Even after death,
they still think of their descendants.
Though they grind their bones to powder,
they can never repay this profound kindness.

According to the records and traditions, in former times, the Perfected Lord of the Northern Dipper descended into the home of Master Lan in Qufu County, Gunzhou. He called himself the King of Filial Piety and Fraternal Duty and addressed Master Lan, saying: "The primordial qi is the Great Dao, and within the sun it is the Radiant King of the Dao of Filial Piety; the original qi is the Perfect Dao, and within the moon it is the Transcendent King of the Dao of Filial Piety; the mysterious qi is the Dao of Filial Piety, and within the Dipper it is the King of Filial Piety and Fraternal Duty. When filial piety reaches Heaven, the sun and moon shine brightly; when filial piety reaches Earth, the myriad things flourish; when filial piety reaches the people, the kingly Way is accomplished. From the Upper Clarity heavens downward, I have manifested in the human realm to demonstrate and expound the Dao of Filial Piety. In the Later Jin dynasty, there shall be a transcendent named Xu, who will transmit my lineage of filial piety and fraternal duty, becoming the foremost among all immortals."

Thereafter, the transcendent Xu indeed transmitted the Dao of Filial Piety, teaching and transforming the world. He lived to the age of one hundred thirty-six, and his entire family of forty-two members ascended to heaven in broad daylight. To this day, on the Western Mountains of Longxing, his deeds remain resplendently evident.

Filial piety is the foundation of all conduct, the root of all virtues. Whether attaining immortality, becoming a buddha, achieving sagehood, or realizing worthiness, none do not arise from the Dao of Filial Piety. Heaven and Earth and the Three Luminaries exert themselves in filial piety—how much more should humans? Moreover, the toil and labor of parents, their boundless and measureless kindness—of their many kindnesses, these ten are the most widely known in the world. Now, I have briefly illustrated them with diagrams and added instructive annotations, universally exhorting the people of the world to practice filial piety and fraternal duty together.

If one is unfilial to parents or disrespectful to elders, even if one serves the Buddha and the Dao with reverence, observes fasts, and performs rituals with diligence, such merit does not extend to one’s kin and is of no benefit to the Dao. These are all authoritative sayings; I humbly wish that they be respected and not neglected.

Respectfully inscribed by Jiang Yue and Lin Daochao.

The Ten Good Deeds of Humans and Devas
The Three Good Deeds of the Body

**The Three Good Deeds of the Body**

**1. Refraining from Killing**
To cherish life and abhor killing is the fundamental heart of Heaven and Earth. If one can uphold this precept, blessings and virtue will flourish deeply. In this life, one’s years will be prolonged; after death, one will be free from guilt. Among all households that accumulate goodness, refraining from killing is the foremost.

**2. Refraining from Theft**
To take what is not given is theft. If one can uphold this precept, one will avoid bringing disaster upon oneself. In life, one may suffer official punishment; in death, one may fall into hell. Among the violent and wicked of the world, thieves bear the greatest shame.

**3. Refraining from Sexual Misconduct**
The cycle of the four forms of birth revolves with lust as its root. If one can uphold this precept, one’s lifespan will be extended. Harming the spirit and defiling virtue, one wastes essence and depletes qi. For one who values life, this is the greatest taboo.

**The Three Good Deeds of the Mind**

**1. Refraining from Greed**
The afflictions of the world arise from the bonds of craving and attachment. If one can be free from greed, afflictions will naturally cease. The sea of desire is profound; the river of attachment is boundless. If one does not seek liberation, one will surely drown.

**2. Refraining from Anger**
The mind of anger is like fire, blazing and unbearable. If one can uphold this precept, forbearance and humility are supreme. Strife, lawsuits, and violence endanger the body and disgrace one’s kin. The ruin of families and the loss of livelihood arise from nothing but anger.

**3. Refraining from Delusion**
The deluded lack wisdom, wandering in darkness like one who walks at night. Without self-reflection, one will surely fall into the abyss. Wine, lust, wealth, and temper—greed, folly, and perversity—those who persist in delusion are no different from beasts.

**The Four Good Deeds of the Mouth**

**1. Refraining from False Speech**
To speak falsely confuses human sentiments. Disasters and wars arise from falsehood. If one does not speak falsely, even ghosts and spirits will trust and turn toward one. The sages and worthies of the Three Teachings all speak of the absence of falsehood.

**2. Refraining from Frivolous Speech**
To adorn one’s words with ornate embellishment is to conceal wrongdoing and gloss over faults. It covers flaws and harbors resentment and calamity. Words without embellishment, a heart of loyalty and integrity—these are the foundations of profound virtue, the accumulation of hidden blessings through generations.

**3. Refraining from Divisive Speech**
To sow discord between ruler and minister, to sever the bonds of flesh and blood, is to invite disaster and enmity, to ruin families and overthrow states. Those who engage in divisive speech speak ill behind others’ backs and flatter to their faces. In life, they suffer punishment; in death, they fall into the Hell of the Plowshare.

**4. Refraining from Harsh Speech**
To utter foul and vile words is to spread poison and filth. To curse and revile, whether high or low, is to inflict pain to the marrow. The four deeds of the mouth are the gates of right and wrong. If one can uphold these precepts, the Dao and virtue will endure.

To refrain from these ten transgressions is to practice the Ten Good Deeds; to violate them is to commit the Ten Evils. Whether one becomes a Buddha, an ancestor, an immortal, or a human, all arises from the cultivation of good karma. The teachings of the Great Brahma Heaven, the Jade Emperor, and the Buddhist precepts are the Dao of the heavens above. Those who practice the Ten Good Deeds will root their goodness firmly, deepen their blessings and virtue, ensure prosperity through generations, and bring honor and success to their descendants. In this life, they will swiftly avoid royal punishments, the perils of blades and warfare, plagues, floods, fires, and famine. After death, their spirits will ascend to the Three Realms, attaining the six supernatural powers and realizing enlightenment. If reborn as humans, they will become kings, nobles, great clans, or eminent officials, enjoying heavenly blessings and boundless joy.

Those who practice the Ten Evils will accumulate deep karmic transgressions, increasing obstacles and hardships. Their families will decline through generations, and their descendants will perish. In this life, they will not escape royal punishments, the perils of blades and warfare, plagues, floods, fires, and famine. After death, their bodies will fall into the Three Wretched Realms, their souls sink into the Nine Hells, enduring suffering in the long night where the fires of hell burn. If reborn among beasts, they will suffer dismemberment. If reborn as humans, they will be poor, lonely, and wretched, afflicted with disabilities, blindness, or deafness, lacking the full use of their six senses, and shunned by others.

The roots of all good and evil are recorded in great detail in the Buddhist sutras and Daoist scriptures. Here, they are listed and annotated to universally exhort the people of the world to practice the Ten Good Deeds together.
