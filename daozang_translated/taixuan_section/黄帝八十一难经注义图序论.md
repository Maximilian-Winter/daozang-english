**Preface to the *Huangdi Eighty-One Difficulties Classic* (Repeated)**
The *Huangdi Eighty-One Difficulties Classic* was composed by **Qín Yuèrén of Lǔ** (Lu Country). The *Records of the Historian* (*Shǐjì Lièzhuàn*) states: *"Biānqué, surname Qín, given name Yuèrén."* This is the same as **Yáng Xióng’s** reference to "Biānqué of Lǔ." Through hypothetical question-and-answer exchanges resolving doubts, it comprises **eighty-one treatises**, hence its name.

The rise of medical classics began with **Huangdi**, so it is attributed to him to clarify its authority—all teachings derive from transmission, not private speculation. Though extant commentaries by **Lǚ Guǎng** and **Yáng Xuāncāo** exist, they are superficial and distorted by heterodox interpretations. Later annotators compounded confusion with verbose, unworthy additions. Thus, the *Difficulties Classic’s* profound meanings remain obscured, and physicians cannot rely on its teachings for practical application.

Upon reading this text, I ventured to interpret the ancients’ intent, providing elucidations and, at the conclusion, summarizing its core principles while integrating discussions from the *Suwen* (*Plain Questions*) and illustrating them. Where **Yáng Xuāncāo’s** commentary harmed the original meaning, I critically annotated and refuted his errors. Only then does the essence of pulse diagnosis become clear—physicians may examine it to discern truth from falsehood and reject erroneous doctrines.

**Three-Part Pulse Diagram**
**Nine-Position Pulse (*Jiǔhòu*) Diagram**

**Diagram of Yin-Yang Excess-Deficiency in Cold Damage (*Shānghán*) Pulse Pathologies**
- *Floating* pulses indicate **Yang excess** (overabundance) or **Yin deficiency** (insufficiency).
  - *Floating in the Yin region* signifies **Yang transforming into Yin**.
- *Cun* (inch) pulse: **Yang**—should be slightly floating.
  *Chi* (foot) pulse: **Yin**—should be slightly sunken.
- *Sunken* pulses indicate **Yang deficiency** (insufficiency) or **Yin excess** (overabundance).
  - *Sunken in the Yang region* signifies **Yin usurping Yang**.
- **Yang excess** manifests as external heat, headache, restlessness, fullness, and sweating—**death ensues**.
  **Yin excess** causes external heat with **fire blocked**—**ten cases perish**.
- **Yang disease (heat)**: Yang predominance → **no sweating**.
  **Yin disease (cold)**: Yin predominance → **excessive sweating, cold body**.
- **Yang deficiency**: External cold, **limbs cold backward**, sweating → **recovery**.
  **Yin excess**: Internal cold, **lower abdomen urgent pain** → **death**.

**Diagram of Excess-Deficiency in the *Zang-Fu* Organs and Yin-Yang Pulse Manifestations**
- **Rapid (数)** = *Fu* viscera (excess).
- **Floating (浮)** = Yang (e.g., **heart and lungs both floating**).
  - *Suwen*: "Precision *qi* depleted" → *Difficulties Classic*: "Needle pulse" = **deficiency**.
  - *Suwen*: "Pathogenic *qi* lodged" → *Difficulties Classic*: "Stable pulse" = **excess**.
- **Slow (迟)** = *Zang* organs (deficiency).
- **Sunken (沉)** = Yin (e.g., **kidneys and liver both sunken**).
- **Clear (清)** = **Lung** (Yin within Yang) → pulse **floating and clear**; excessively clear = **lung pulse**; slightly clear = **large intestine pulse**.
- **Large (大)** = **Heart** (Yang within Yang) → pulse **floating and large**; excessively large = **heart pulse**; slightly large = **small intestine pulse**.
- **Moderate-Slack (中缓)** = **Spleen** (Yin-Yang balance, body of deficiency) → pulse **moderate and slack**; excessively slack = **spleen pulse**; slightly slack = **stomach pulse**.
- **Taut (弦)** = **Liver** (Yang within Yin) → pulse **sunken and taut**; excessively taut = **liver pulse**; slightly taut = **gallbladder pulse**.
- **Small (小)** = **Kidney** (Yin within Yin) → pulse **sunken and small**; excessively small = **kidney pulse**; slightly small = **bladder pulse**.

**Diagram of Excess-Deficiency Pulse and Life-and-Death Prognosis**
- **Deficient pulse**: Weak arrival → **insufficiency**, disease **internal**.
- **Excess pulse**: Strong arrival → **overabundance**, disease **external**.
  - **Rapid (数)** = *Fu* viscera.
  - **Slow (迟)** = *Zang* organs.

**Liver Pulse (弦长)**
- **One breath, two arrivals** = **normal**.
- **Three arrivals** = **deviates from classic**.
- **Four arrivals** = **depletes essence**.
- **Five arrivals** = **death**.
- **Six arrivals** = **life extinct**.

**Deficient Pulse (损脉)**
- **One breath, one arrival** = **deviates from classic**.
- **Two breaths, one arrival** = **depletes essence**.
- **Three breaths, one arrival** = **death**.
- **Four breaths, one arrival** = **life extinct**.

**Heart Pulse (心脉浮大)**
- **Floating and large**, one breath two arrivals, one inhalation two arrivals—**not too large nor too small** = **normal**.
- **Spleen Pulse (脾脉中缓)**
  - **Moderately slack** = **normal**.
    - One breath three arrivals, one inhalation three arrivals = **harmonious adaptation**.
- **Lung Pulse (肺脉短墙)**
  - **Short and tight** = **illness onset**.
    - One breath four arrivals, one inhalation four arrivals = **disease progression**.
- **Kidney Pulse (肾脉沉小)**
  - **Deep and small** = **disease worsening**.
    - One breath five arrivals, one inhalation five arrivals = **critical illness**.
  - **The patient shall be distressed**.
    - One breath six arrivals, one inhalation six arrivals = **pulse of death**.

**Diagram of the Inner Front (Left Side) Pulse Locations**
Yang Xuan’s annotation of the *Nan Jing* states:
- The **left wrist’s *cun* (寸) position**—where the **Heart** and **Small Intestine** pulses emerge. #1
- The **left wrist’s *chi* (尺) middle**—where the **Kidney** and **Bladder** pulses emerge.
- The **right wrist’s *cun* (寸) position**—where the **Lung** and **Large Intestine** pulses emerge.
- The **upper *guan* (关) position**—where the **Spleen** and **Stomach** pulses emerge.
- The **right wrist’s *chi* (尺) middle**—where the **Gate of Life** and **Triple Burner** pulses emerge.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
If the **left wrist’s *cun* pulse** is **floating**, it is the **Small Intestine** pulse;
If it is **deep**, it is the **Heart** pulse.

This teaching originates in *Pulse Law Praise* (脉法赞), but its detailed exposition appears in *The Pulse Classic* (脉经). The error lies in conflating *cun* (寸) with *cun-kou* (寸口), so the **upper *guan* (关)** and **middle *chi* (尺)** positions were later added. Though *Zhong Jing* (仲景) also mentions *cun-kou*, *guan-shang* (关上), and *chi-zhong* (尺中), he dared not alter the pulse law without proper verification. Later generations, even eminent physicians, failed to distinguish these correctly due to their ingrained habits, thus unable to discern the **pulses of the Five *Zang* Organs**. This diagram of **Excess-Deficiency *Zang*-*Fu* Pulses** was refined in the Jin Dynasty (晋).

**Diagram of the Heaven-Earth Yin-Yang Ascend-Descend Beginning-and-End (天地阴阳升降始终之图)**
Two Difficulties in Pulse Diagrams (二难画图)
These two difficulties and all diagrams that follow are **subsidiary diagrams** (下注图).
In all the diagrams below, **Yin and Yang channels** (黑白道) are marked internally to distinguish the **Yin-Yang beginning-and-end** (升降终始).
The **Heaven Gate** (天门) and **Earth Gate** (地户), **Human Gate** (人门) and **Ghost Gate** (鬼门), are the **Yin-Yang ascend-descend critical junctions and gateways** (阴阳升降关格门户).
The **Qi Mouth** (气口) and **Ren Ying** (人迎), as well as the **left and right Spirit Gates** (左右神门), are the **gateways for inhalation-exhalation and pulse depth measurements** (呼吸上下尺寸关格门户).

Yin-qi begins at **Establishment of Autumn** (立秋) and Yang-qi ends at **Establishment of Winter** (立冬).
Yin-qi ends at **Establishment of Summer** (立夏) and Yang-qi begins at **Establishment of Spring** (立春).

**Diagram of the Yin-Yang Flow of Hands and Feet, Beginning-and-End (手足阴阳流注始终之图)**
Pulse depth measurements of **Yin and Yang** (尺寸阴阳) follow the rhythm of inhalation-exhalation, tracing the **beginning-and-end diagram** (上引始终图) above.
Yin is **enveloped** (裹), reaching inward to the *cun* (寸内) as one inhales.
Yang is **superficial** (表), extending outward to the *chi* (尺外) as one exhales.

**Three Difficulties in Pulse Diagrams (三难画图)**
When diagnosing pulses at the **wrist’s posterior** (掌后), the markings should be **tightly arranged** (约文), with the three fingers pressed closely (密排三指头).
The region **half-finger before** (半指之前) is the **inner *cun*** (寸内), the **Yang-within-Yang** (阳中之阳).
The region **half-finger after** (半指之后) is the **outer *cun*** (寸外), the **Yang-within-Yin** (阳中之阴).
The **upper *guan* (关上)**—half-finger before the second finger—is **Yang** (阳), while the **lower *guan* (关下)**—half-finger after—is **Yin** (阴).
The **outer *chi* (尺外)**—half-finger before the third finger—is **Yang** (阳), while the **inner *chi* (尺内)**—half-finger after—is **Yin** (阴).

When the **outer *cun* pulse is Yang, it is floating and dispersed** (寸外阳浮散);
When the **inner *cun* pulse is Yin, it is floating and large** (寸内阴浮大).
When the **upper *guan* pulse is Yang, it is taut and long** (关上阳弦长);
When the **lower *guan* pulse is Yin, it is dense and frequent** (关下阴弥繁).
When the **outer *chi* pulse is Yang, it is deep and slippery** (尺外阳沉滑);
When the **inner *chi* pulse is Yin, it is deep and moist** (尺内阴沉濡).

This outlines the **Yin-Yang pulses of the left hand** (此左手脉之阴阳).
By observing the **pulse’s condition** (脉状), one may clarify its **covering and constriction** (覆缢).
This diagram also reveals the **Ren Ying and Qi Mouth** (人迎气口), the **left and right Spirit Gates** (左右神门), and the **single division of the *cun*, *chi*, and *guan* regions** (寸尺关前关后一分接).

According to *The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine* (《素问》):
The **Ren Ying and Qi Mouth** (人迎气口) are located at the **neck**, modeling **Heaven and Earth** (天地), and marking the **beginning-and-end gateways** (始终之门户).

**Diagram of the Eighteen Difficulties in Pulse Diagnosis (十八难画图)**
The **old commentary** (旧经注) states:
The **left hand’s Heart pulse** (手心) governs the **Heart’s Pericardial Pulse** (主心包络脉).
The **left hand’s Minor Yang pulse** (手少阳) governs the **San Jiao pulse** (三焦脉).
Thus, they are **combined as the left hand’s central region** (故合为左手中部).
The **right foot’s Major Yin pulse** (足太阴) governs the **Spleen pulse** (脾脉).
The **right foot’s Yang Brightness pulse** (足阳明) governs the **Stomach pulse** (胃脉).
Thus, they are **combined as the right hand’s central region** (故合为右手中部).
This text makes such distinctions.

However, if one follows *Pulse Classic’s Canonical Pairings* (脉《经配》三部), the divisions differ again.

The **old commentary** (旧经) holds this view, but the **earlier annotation** (前注) was in error. This diagram is fully presented to correct its text.

Yang Shi said: The **left hand’s Heart pulse** (手心) governs the **Heart’s Pericardial Pulse** (心包络脉), the **left hand’s Minor Yang pulse** (手少阳) governs the **San Jiao pulse** (三焦脉), thus they are **combined as the left hand’s upper region** (故合为左手上部).
The **right foot’s Major Yin pulse** (足太阴) governs the **Spleen pulse** (脾脉), the **right foot’s Yang Brightness pulse** (足阳明) governs the **Stomach pulse** (胃脉), thus they are **combined as the left hand’s middle region** (故合为左手中部).
This text makes such distinctions.
If one follows *Pulse Classic’s Canonical Pairings* (《脉经》配三部), the divisions differ again.
This method Yang Shi could not clarify its principle, hence his differing statement.

The teacher then reverses the three regions to correspond with the **Five Phases** (五行) and **Six Qi** (六气), stating:
This **Cun** (寸) and **Chi** (尺) [pulse positions], when reversed, again follow the three regions, asking: Which pulse does each region govern?
He explained:
The **upper region** (上部) follows **Heaven** (天), governing **illnesses above the chest to the head** (胸以上至头有疾);
The **middle region** (中部) follows **Man** (人), governing **illnesses below the diaphragm to above the navel** (鬲下至脐上有疾);
The **lower region** (下部) follows **Earth** (地), governing **illnesses below the navel to the feet** (脐以下至足有疾).
Hence the saying: *"Examine and then determine the sequence"* (故言审而次之者也).

Again, Wang Shuhu reversed his own sequence, starting from the **left Cun** (左寸) and proceeding inversely:
**Left hand**: **Heart** (心), **Small Intestine** (小肠), **Liver** (肝), **Gallbladder** (胆), **Kidney** (肾);
**Right hand**: **Lung** (肺), **Large Intestine** (大肠), **Spleen** (脾), **Stomach** (胃), **Command** (命);
For women, this sequence is reversed.
Examining from the back, the **Chi pulse** (尺脉) aligns with the third region for diagnosing **interrupted illnesses** (断病).
Indeed, both **Chi pulses** (两尺), when reversed, govern **illnesses below the navel to the feet** (脐以下至足有疾), hence the saying: *"Examine and then determine the sequence"* (扁鹊云审而次之), and Wang Shuhu said: *"One must carefully seek and follow the pulse of the Heart’s Child"* (王叔和云用心子细须寻趁).

**Right hand diagnosis**:
- **Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Fire** (火) ascends in flames (炎上) and cannot descend to **generate** (生) the **Hand Heart** (手心), which governs **Minor Yang Fire** (少阳火).
- **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阳) and **Foot Shaoyin** (足厥阴): **Wood** (木) generates (生) the **Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴), where the **Lord Fire** (君火) resides.
- **Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) and **Foot Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Water** (水) flows downward (流下) and cannot ascend to **generate** (生) the **Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴), where **Minor Yang Wood** (少阳木) resides.

**Left hand diagnosis**:
- **Hand Heart** (手心): **Minor Yang Relative Fire** (少阳相火) generates (生).
- **Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴) and **Foot Yangming** (足阳明): **Earth** (土) generates (生) **Metal** (金).
- **Hand Taiyin** (手太阴) and **Hand Yangming** (手阳明): **Metal** (金) generates (生).
- **Foot Yangming** (足阳明): **Earth** (土) generates (生) **Metal** (金).
- **Hand Yangming** (手阳明): **Metal** (金) generates (生).
- **Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) and **Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴): **Water** (水) flows downward (流下).

**Diagram of the Sixty-Seventh Difficulty: The Canonical Pairings of Jing-Well, Ying-Spring, and Shu-Stream Points (井荣俞经合图)**
This diagram clarifies the **beginning-and-end gateways** (始终) of the **canals and collaterals** (经络) and the **origins** (原) of the **Five Zang** (五藏) and **Six Fu** (六府).

**Hand Jueyin** (手厥阴) **Heart’s Pericardial Canal** (心包络之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Zhong Chong** (中冲) point, located at the tip of the middle finger (手中指之端), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Tian Di** (天地) point, located one **cun** below the armpit and behind the nipple (腋下乳后一寸), at the junction of the ribs (胁肋问).

**Hand Taiyin** (手太阴) **Lung Canal** (肺之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao-Shang** (少商) point, located on the inner side of the thumb (手大指内侧), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Zhong Fu** (中府) point, located one **cun** below the **Yun Men** (云门) point, three ribs above the nipple (乳上三肋问).

**Hand Yangming** (手阳明) **Large Intestine Canal** (大肠之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Shang Yang** (商阳) point, located on the side of the thumb’s adjacent finger (手大指次指之侧), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Ying Xiang** (迎香) point, located above the **He Jiao** (禾胶) point beside the nostrils (鼻孔旁).

**Hand Taiyang** (手太阳) **Small Intestine Canal** (小肠之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao Ze** (少泽) point, located at the tip of the little finger (手小指之端), one **fen** below the fingernail (去爪甲下一分).

**Hand Shaoyang** (手少阳) **San Jiao Canal** (三焦之经):

- **Terminates** (终) at the **Er Men** (耳门) point, located at the anterior junction of the ear’s flesh (耳前起肉缺).

The *Ling Shu* (《灵枢经》) states: *"Shaoyin has no Shu point—does it not treat illness?"*
This refers to **external** (外) canal illness, meaning it **treats external but not internal** (故治外不治内), hence the **Shaoyin True Heart** (少阴真心) aligns with the **Lord Fire** (君火) position, treating **external but not internal** (故不治内而治外).

**Hand Shaoyin** (手少阴) **True Heart Canal** (真心之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Shao Chong** (少冲) point, located on the inner side of the little finger (手小指内侧), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Ji Quan** (极泉) point, located in the armpit beneath the **Sheng Nei** (声内) point, between the tendons at the **dynamic pulse** (动脉).

**Foot Jueyin** (足厥阴) **Liver Canal** (肝之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Da Dun** (大敦) point, located at the tip of the big toe (足大指之端), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Qi Men** (期门) point, located one **cun** and five **fen** beside the **Bu Rong** (不容) point, at the end of the second rib (二肋端).

**Foot Yangming** (足阳明) **Stomach Canal** (胃之经):

**Foot Taiyang** (足太阳) **Bladder Canal** (膀胱之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Jing Ming** (睛明) point, located beside the **Pi Li** (毗泪) point at the inner corner of the eye (目内).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Zhi Yin** (至阴) point, located on the outer side of the little toe (足小指外侧), a distance from the fingernail like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).

**Foot Shaoyin** (足少阴) **Kidney Canal** (肾之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Yong Quan** (涌泉) point, located in the depression of the sole (足心陷中), found by curling the toes inward (屈足卷指宛宛中).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Yu Fu** (俞府) point, located two **cun** beside the **Nan Xing** (难玑) point, at the **Ju Gu** (巨骨) point.

**Foot Shaoyang** (足少阳) **Gallbladder Canal** (胆之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Qiao Yin** (窍阴) point, located at the tip of the little toe’s adjacent toe (足小指次指之端), like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Tong Zi Ti** (瞳子体) point, located five **fen** beside the outer corner of the eye (目外毗).

**Foot Taiyin** (足太阴) **Spleen Canal** (脾之经):
- **Originates** (起) at the **Yin Bai** (隐白) point, located between the big toe’s inner side (足大指内侧之间), a distance from the fingernail corner like a **chive leaf** (韭叶).
- **Terminates** (终) at the **Da Bao** (大包) point, located three **cun** below the **Yuan Ye** (渊腋) point, at the junction of the ninth rib (九肋问).
