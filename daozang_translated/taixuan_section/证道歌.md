**Song of Attaining the Dao, with Preface**
By Zuo Zhangzi

Those who seek immortality and ascension, soaring through the clouds and transforming like feathers, must first comprehend the True Unity. The True Unity is the Dao; the Dao is the Origin; the Origin is the primordial blackness within humanity. Qi gives birth to the myriad forms, and humans are endowed with primordial qi at birth.

The *Daoist Scripture* states: "The Dao is empty yet inexhaustible in use."
The *Scripture of Jade Capital Mountain* states: "The qi of emptiness and supreme harmony exhales and inhales the flowing rosy mist, the way of fetal breathing that stills the hundred passages."
The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: "Inhaling and exhaling primordial qi to seek immortality is like an infant brother within the mother’s womb, its function therein."

Primordial qi assumes many forms, ultimately unknowable. Thus, the supreme sages composed scriptural formulas—*The Dragon and Tiger*, *The Kinship of the Three*, the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* in five thousand words, the songs of the immortals, *The Yellow Emperor’s Yin Talisman*, *The Jade Pivot*, *The Jade Chamber*, and other works—some as odes, some as chants, some as talismans, some as records. All such methods expound the essence of the fetal state, teaching later learners to return together to the Great Dao. How could its mysteries be spoken of directly?

Thus, the sages left their formulas and intentions, often employing circular language, speaking through metal and stone, as lead and mercury, or referring to cinnabar and quicksilver. People today, not understanding their origin, fail to fathom the sages’ intent and recklessly engage in artificial practices. They burn elixirs and refine medicines, consuming them in hopes of longevity and transcending the mortal realm—how distant they are from the truth!

Foolish people, unable to grasp the teachings of the fetal state, how can they comprehend the depth of the sages’ formulas and immortal scriptures? An ancient song says:
*"To refine the medicine, one must master the formula;
The Mysterious Pass is hidden in the ancient scriptures.
When the work of the Returned Elixir is complete,
Heaven’s chariot, borne by five-colored clouds, will come to welcome you."*

Master Guigu said: "Though the sage studies, the sage achieves through study—sagacity is not natural."
The Master said: "I am not natural; I attained it through study."
The *Lotus Sutra* states: "For one to build a palace in the void is not necessarily difficult."
The True Person of the Three Origins said: "There has never been one who, without studying this Dao, could ascend in clouds and transform like feathers."
The *Lotus Sutra* also says: "Like one digging a well, first removing the yellow earth, then seeing the black mud, one knows water is near."
Wei Boyang said: "Formulas are not idly made; the Dao is not idly practiced."

Just as a scholar who passes the imperial examination must dwell long in deep mountains and secluded valleys, cultivating his craft until his work is complete before ascending the ranks and having his name inscribed on the golden list, so too must one seeking immortality trace the source to its root, grasping its essence as if holding it in hand.

Question: To what is this formula most closely akin?
Answer: The Dao is akin to qi. To measure it with wisdom is to grasp it as if holding it in hand.

Question: What, then, is the Dao most closely akin to?
Answer: The Dao is akin to qi. Just as fish depend on water for life, dying when removed from it, humans depend on qi for life, perishing when qi is exhausted. Qi is the mother of humans; humans are the children of the Dao.

The *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: "The Dao nurtures the mother; the way of nurturing the mother is called the Way of Filial Piety." The mother of the Dao is none other than this blackness. She is the mother of all immortals, the mother within the human body, fully present therein.

In the Jin dynasty, Wu Xu and eleven others from Mount Xishan in Yuzhang together nurtured their Dao-mother. Later, in the Yuan Kang era, all twelve attained the Dao through cultivation. Their altar sites remain to this day—how could this be empty words?

Learned cultivators of the Dao who seek the Way of longevity must not depart from the primordial qi within the body. An ancient song says:
*"Do not recklessly act with malice."*
And also:
*"All other principles are but vain toil and suffering."*

The *Daoist Scripture* says: "Cultivate it within the body, and its virtue becomes true."
And also: "Retain it within the body, and it gives birth to spirit; bestow it upon others, and it gives birth to people." Beyond this, there is nothing else to be done.

Moreover, external lead, external mercury, external stones, external gold, the four yellows and eight minerals, herbs and trees—none of these are the medicines of the immortals.

I have composed fifteen verses on attaining the Dao to instruct later generations. Those who practice accordingly will achieve the same aspiration: to return together to the Great Dao of Non-Action.

**Song of Attaining the Dao**

**1. Attaining the Dao**
Circulating the golden essence to nourish the myriad spirits,
Naturally one does not die and attains longevity.
Do not learn from worldly people, enslaved by pleasures of desire—
Endlessly toiling, they become but a heap of dust.

**2. The Spiritual Medicine**
Nameless and formless, yet forcibly named,
The essence, qi, and spirit within the body are most numinous.
The spiritual medicine does not depend on external things;
When yin and yang restrain each other, it must be accomplished.

**3. The Ninefold Returned Elixir**
Heaven and earth are the furnace; the medicine is within the body.
Yin and yang, unfathomable, are called the numinous.
Primordial qi, flying like frost, completes the ninefold cycle;
The Returned Elixir is originally the fluid of supreme harmony.

**4. The Civil and Martial Fire Times**
Spring, summer, autumn, winter—each day shifts,
Dragon and tiger, in mutual ascent, move through Kan and Li.
Heaven and earth, day and night, enact their union;
The twelve hours are divided at midnight and noon.

**5. The Spirit Directing the Fire**
To refine the medicine, one must know the spirit directing the fire;
Do not burn the firewood and charcoal of the mundane world.
The three flowers’ fierce flame resides within your body—
Vainly chasing after it, the days and months are consumed.

**6. The Golden Flower and Yellow Sprout**
Yellow sprout, yellow sprout, attuned to the bell’s rhythm,
Heaven and earth conceal it, calling it the True Unity.
Simply guide it to the Flowery Pond to welcome spring,
And the myriad things, containing the embryo, begin to flower and bear fruit.

**7. Black Lead and White Mercury**
On the third day, geng is born, and the Dui gate opens;
Black gold spews forth the white silver embryo.
In the nine-six of spring and summer, the three-five is applied;
In the seven-nine of autumn and winter, it returns and comes again.

**8. The Crimson Dragon and Golden Tiger**
Within wood, the urgent fire of jia is the Azure Dragon;
Within water, the hidden metal of geng is the White Tiger.
The creation and transformation of heaven and earth lie in the Three Numinous;
Only when yin and yang are fathomed can they be seen.

**9. The Mysterious Radiance of the Golden Crucible**
A three-legged form, divided by the inch,
Yin and yang emerge, resembling heaven and earth.
The crucible needs no casting of gold or silver—
The first nine’s hidden dragon is the gate of transformation.

**10. The True Essence of the Dao’s Application**
The Dao speaks of "having" to create benefit,
Yet also speaks of "non-being" to serve its use.
The formless form resides within the single qi,
Simply return to the root’s birth, revert to the root’s seed.

**11. The Flowing Pearl of Great Yang**
Great harmony pervades the body, called the flowing sun;
The primordial yang qi, round as a pearl.
The three fields, above and below, align with heaven and earth’s positions—
The moth’s key stirs the wind, turning the door’s pivot.

**12. Mother and Child: Abiding Spirit in the World**
The child seeks long life, qi as its mother,
Flowing through the three origins to purify the viscera.
All gold and stone in the world are yin substances—
A decaying frame must be refined with yang elixir to mend.

**13. Cultivating Original Qi to Become a True Person**
Cultivate original qi to transform the body into myriad spirits;
You possess it yourself—ask not your neighbor.
Inhaling and exhaling the Flowery Pond’s flowing upper scene,
The heavenly Dao opens to form an immortal body.

**14. Refining Essence into the Heavenly Dao to Become a Divine Immortal**
The precious elixir, ninefold refined, secures the essence field;
Ascend directly to the Muddy Pellet to fulfill destiny.
Divine immortals, empty and quiescent, transcend the three realms—
Shedding the body, dissolving and transforming like serpents and cicadas.

**15. The River Chariot**
The Kun image’s chariot rests in the earth’s square;
Kan’s water is the river, the Dark Warrior’s domain.
Those who attain the Dao ascend to become sovereigns;
Those who lose it descend to become mere lights.

The study of the Dao: the eightfold essence of true qi ascends to pay court at the Muddy Pellet,
The eightfold essence of true qi congeals in the Jade Palace,
Transforming into the supreme divine immortals.
The Dao resides within the human body—
Seek it not without!
