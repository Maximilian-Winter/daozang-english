**Preface to Su Lü Zi**
The *Su Lü Zi* takes its name from the *Book of Changes*, Hexagram *Lü* (Treading): "At the first nine, treading with purity—no blame." It takes pure simplicity as the foundation of treading and conduct as its foremost priority. Though clad in plain cloth, one must first tread the governance and teachings of the former kings.

Thus, it draws from the origins of Heaven and Earth, the inception of *Qian* and *Kun*, the norms set forth by the sages in their teachings, and the traces of the worthy and wise in their practice of the Dao. The beginnings of fortune and misfortune arise from what one treads. Therefore, the sage treads the imperial throne with virtue and suffers no remorse, for his radiance is luminous. The scholar and commoner tread with discernment to distinguish above and below, thereby stabilizing the people’s will.

Herein, fourteen chapters are compiled and titled *Su Lü Zi*, serving as admonitions and exhortations.

**Treading the Dao**
*Su Lü Zi* states: The Dao in its origin is nameless, and in its namelessness abides at the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The beginning of Heaven and Earth is called the *Hunyuan*. At the inception of *Hunyuan*, there was no form, no image. Once the Two Modes divided, they gave birth to the myriad images. Thus, it is called the Dao.

From the era of *Longhan* onward, the Three Sovereigns relied upon it to establish their teachings, and the Five Emperors depended on it to govern. It began with a single transformation, pure and natural. To clarify the cycles of cold and heat, the sequence of yin and yang was divided. The sages of high antiquity trod this path: they spoke no words, taught no doctrines, and held no intent toward things, yet things came to them of their own accord. They did not instruct the people, yet the people looked up to them. This was the treading of the pure and pristine royal Dao.

The lords who first drew the trigrams and the rulers who first cultivated the wilds all trod this path and brought about transformation. When riding oxen and horses, they trod it to dispel tyranny; when employing it, they removed the people’s suffering. Zhuanxu trod the path of loyalty and compliance, Emperor Ku trod the path of clarity and harmony, Tang Yao trod the path of humility and compliance and let his robes hang long, and Yu Shun trod the path of filial piety and fraternal duty and yielded his throne. This was the treading of the imperial Dao.

Yu practiced the Dao of diligence and frugality to govern the waters, Tang was reverent and thereby moved Heaven, the Western Earl possessed supreme virtue and was called venerable, and King Wu followed the Dao of filial piety to overthrow cruelty. These sages established teachings through the kingly Dao, ensuring that the elderly had care in their final years, the able-bodied had work, the young had nurture, and the widowed, orphaned, solitary, disabled, and infirm all had sustenance. Men had their duties, and women had their homes. This was the transformation of governing the world through the Dao.

As for the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, they esteemed only simplicity and eschewed ornamentation; the Uncrowned King likewise returned to pure simplicity. All discarded embellishment to create teachings, forsook literary adornment to return to truth, did not exalt the worthy to prevent contention, and did not prize rare goods to prevent theft. They condemned palaces with carved beams and painted rafters, and honored rulers who dwelt in humble abodes and ate plain fare. The *Daodejing* states: “I possess three treasures, which I safeguard and uphold: the first is compassion, the second is frugality, and the third is not daring to put oneself before the world.” This is the origin of treading the Dao.

It further says: “My greatest affliction is that I have a self. If I had no self, what affliction would I have?” This is the Dao of the perfected, who forget the self and tread beyond images.

As for consuming mist and ingesting qi, sealing the senses and revolving the pill, this is the path of treading beyond the dust. Long ago, Master Yayu, while still in the world, taught the people the Dao of cultivation and planting to sustain life, yet in the end he departed by boat. The Perfected Yan, while running a divination stall, taught others the Dao of loyalty and filial piety, then ascended with his entire household. Thus, the Great Dao is not confined to any vessel; all things possess knowledge. The Dao does not act in vain; things respond mysteriously. It is not found in lofty towers or vast halls, nor within the groves of the Western Regions.

In recent times, the High Lord of Huainan established the Hall of Extended Harmony to seek the Dao—this was mistaken. The foundation of establishing oneself and practicing the Dao does not surpass the harmony of ruler and minister, the kindness of father and filial piety of son, the friendliness of elder brother and deference of younger brother, the compliance of husband and chastity of wife, diligence and frugality in the household, and loyalty to the state.

In ancient times, the Xia, Yin, Wen, and Wu dynasties flourished because they attained the Dao, while Jie, Zhou, You, and Li perished because they lost it. Thus, the Dao cannot be abandoned: attaining it brings prosperity, losing it brings ruin. Therefore, the sage cherishes the people, benefits customs, bestows virtue, and preserves his position.

Man’s relation to the Dao is like a fish’s to water. If the fish loses water, it perishes; if man loses the Dao, he is ruined. Encompassing the myriad images and governing them through the Dao—this is the Great Dao. To prosper one’s person, one should tread and practice it. This is clear.

**Treading Virtue**
*Su Lü Zi* states: The Most High values virtue. Virtue is the convergence of all goodness and the gathering of a hundred blessings. Long ago, Shun possessed the virtue of fragrance, and the people flocked to him like ants drawn to sweetness—not that the ants sought the ants, but that the ants sought the fragrance; not that Shun sought the people, but that the people sought virtue.

When King Wen was the Western Earl, two-thirds of the world turned to Zhou. The virtue of the Western Earl was like planting bamboo to await birds: the bamboo did not seek the birds, but the birds, pursued by pheasants, came of their own accord to the bamboo. Zhou did not seek the people, but the people, oppressed by Zhou, came of their own accord to Zhou. Thus, it is known that virtue can be bestowed, while cruelty cannot be indulged.

Constantly applying the virtue of cherishing life to harmonize the people’s hearts, spreading civil virtue far and wide, distant lands will come to submit. Therefore, the emperors and kings of ancient times all established virtue to bequeath teachings. Among the Five Phases and Five Emperors, in wood it is called the virtue of wood, in fire the virtue of fire, in earth the virtue of earth, in metal the virtue of metal, and in water the virtue of water. The Five Phases engender one another, each in turn becoming virtue.

Thus, water, fire, metal, wood, earth, and grain rectify virtue, their beneficial use enriching life—these are the Nine Merits, teachings established for ten thousand generations. This is the application of virtue, the bestowal of virtue. Without name, it resides in things: if all things attain it, they endure; if they lose it, they perish. If Heaven loses virtue, cold and heat will not arrive in season; if Earth loses virtue, the myriad things will not grow; if man loses virtue, his person will surely collapse.

Thus, Great Yu deliberated on the Nine Merits, and Gaoyao deliberated on the Nine Virtues, and the world was governed. The ruler establishes virtue through compassion and love, the minister achieves renown through loyalty and filial piety. Virtue lies in good governance, and governance lies in nurturing the people. The foundation of nurturing the people in martial affairs consists of seven: prohibiting violence, suppressing weapons, safeguarding the great, establishing merit, pacifying the people, harmonizing the masses, and enriching resources. In civil affairs, it consists of five: warmth, kindness, reverence, frugality, and deference. Reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness all return to the Five Virtues.

Virtue can repel water and fire, move ghosts and spirits, tame dragons and serpents, and transform birds and beasts. It can also cause stars and constellations to retreat, and restore mountains and rivers. Mulberry and catalpa trees wither of themselves, ominous birds depart, the offspring of nest-serpents abandon their gold, and guests leave behind their medicines. It forgives the offense of the severed tassel, and fulfills the loyalty of the lacquered body. All these are bestowed as hidden merits and receive manifest rewards.

Thus it is fitting to extend this to all things, never failing even in a single word. The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality, aiding only those who possess virtue. For those who govern states or households, fortunate are they who tread this path—if they remain steadfast without weariness, prosperity and flourishing shall be theirs.

**Treading Loyalty**
Master Su Lü said: Loyalty and integrity are the essence of Heaven and Earth, the finest spirit of human relations. In examining the records of past ages, only those of true loyalty have their names inscribed in history, enduring through ten thousand generations—thus, those who perish in loyalty do not truly perish. In ancient times, the Duke of Zhou exemplified utmost loyalty, serving King Wen, King Wu, and King Cheng. Even when King Cheng was but an infant in swaddling clothes, the Duke served three reigns with unwavering devotion, his steadfastness surpassing gold and jade, his integrity exceeding pine and bamboo. To prolong his life to ninety years, he offered himself in sacrifice, entrusting the young orphan to safety, and thereby removed the slander of Guan and Cai. Though his deeds belong to antiquity, his conduct remains ever fresh, recorded in the classics as a model for the wise and worthy. The Grand Duke governed Zhou with royal virtue, wielding the authority of hegemony to overthrow the Shang. Together, these two ministers flanked and aided Zhou, their achievements enduring through ten thousand generations. Again, we hear of Guan Zhong assisting Duke Huan, unifying the realm to honor Zhou, and Zhang Liang aiding the Liu clan, bridging the Honggou to restore Han. As for summoning the Four Elders to sway Emperor Hui, or embracing the young sovereign to receive the feudal lords—there were also those who lay across corpses to remonstrate, or shattered their skulls against pillars in protest. Through past and present, such men are revered as paragons of loyalty. But those who call a deer a horse, invert black and yellow, coerce the weak, and deceive the orphaned—who depose the worthy and usurp righteousness—shall feast on phoenix flesh in life and incur eternal reproach in death, defiling the Two Modes and trespassing within the Three Powers. Thus, the loyal and worthy deserve eternal commemoration, becoming exemplars for this age and glorious tales for the next. As the *Book of Songs* says: *"The virtuous man, the noble lord—his conduct is never flawed."* How flourishing is it for the worthy to tread this path!

**Treading Filial Piety**
Master Su Lü said: The classics state: *"Filial piety is the constant Dao of Heaven, the righteous principle of Earth, and the conduct of humanity."* It is also said: *"Filial piety is the root of virtue, the source from which teaching arises."* For those who govern states or households, establishing virtue comes first, and the foundation of virtue begins with filial piety. In ancient times, Shun and Yu possessed supreme virtue and utmost filial piety, preserving their persons and perfecting their virtue—both achieved this through filial conduct, and Shun’s yielding brought him honor. Thus it is said: *"The former kings had supreme virtue and essential Dao to harmonize the world; the people lived in concord, and none above or below harbored resentment—this was the beginning of filial piety."* Filial piety moves Heaven and Earth, resonating with the divine. When the Son of Heaven is filial, the tortoise and dragon bear prophetic charts; when a commoner is filial, grasses and trees flourish. In the past, Master Zeng was filial to his parents, never daring to harm even his hair or skin, and until the end of his life, he never forgot the principles of filial piety, even in the space of a single step. He took from birds, beasts, grasses, and trees only in due season, never violating the Dao of Heaven, and exhausted his strength in loyal devotion. Such was the resolve of a filial son. Among the hundred virtues of humanity, one who lacks filial piety is like a casket filled with jade fragments—ultimately of no use. Those who practice filial piety naturally ascend in spirit, their rank elevated by the Heavenly Emperor, their persons secure and affairs auspicious, bringing honor and prominence in their time. Fortunate is the noble person who treads this path, preserving a hundred blessings.

Here ends the first scroll of *Master Su Lü*.

**Master Su Lü on Benevolence**

Master Su Lü said: In ancient times, the sovereigns who tasted herbs taught the people to eat grains and cease killing—this was the transformation of utmost benevolence. The Yellow Emperor removed harm from the people by slaying Chiyou—this was the teaching of utmost benevolence. The Great Luo clan crafted nets and traps to eliminate the harm of birds and beasts—this was the application of utmost benevolence. Yao and Shun employed the Eight Yuan and Eight Kai, illuminating the four directions and penetrating the four quarters—this was the governance of utmost benevolence. Yu carved Dragon Gate to dispel the harm of floods—this was the achievement of utmost benevolence. Tang removed the three-sided nets—this was the policy of utmost benevolence. King Wen buried the dry bones—this was the kindness of utmost benevolence.

Zhou lost benevolence, so King Wu slew him, adorned the ruins of Weizi, released Jizi from prison, and sealed the tomb of Bigan. Thereupon, the auspicious omen of the red sparrow bearing a book appeared. Benevolence was attained, benevolence was preserved, and blessings overflowed for a hundred generations. Heaven commands the lord of men to govern the state with benevolence. Thus, he confesses his faults and weeps for the guilty, swallows locusts and gnats—this is how he flourishes.

Qin was not benevolent: it burned books and buried scholars alive, and its ruler perished at Shaqiu, not lasting two generations before Ziying was contested by Liu and Xiang. Han practiced benevolence and frugality, spared Ziying, and gained the world. Chu was not benevolent, cruel to all things, killed Ziying, and lost the world. Thus, we know that practicing benevolence is the foundation of a flourishing state—therefore, it may be trodden.

The Sage Confucius said: "The benevolent love others." He also said: "To delight in life and detest killing is benevolence; to love others and benefit all things is benevolence; to master oneself and return to ritual is benevolence; to be compassionate and commiserate is benevolence." Rewarding the good and punishing the evil, rescuing the drowning and saving the imperiled—these are the steps of the benevolent.

Scholars have died to perfect benevolence, fled to perfect benevolence. They set out food beneath the mulberry’s shade, built walls on perilous paths; some saved yellow sparrows, some released white turtles; bestowed kindness upon wounded snakes, extracted thorns from choking tigers; bestowed boundless charity without weariness, distributed kindness with method. In spring, they did not fell trees or overturn nests; in summer, they did not burn fields or harm crops; in autumn, they relieved orphans and aided widows; in winter, they covered and concealed the hidden. The noble person follows the seasons, treads benevolence, and acts—thus, the merit of benevolence is manifest.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life; the great treasure of the sage is called position." It also says: "The noble person embodies benevolence, and this suffices to lead others." Only the utmost worthy treads this path without weariness.

**Master Su Lü on Righteousness**

Master Su Lü said: Managing wealth and rectifying speech, forbidding the people from wrongdoing—this is called righteousness. Thus, righteousness does not contend with things, yet things naturally submit to it. Confucius said: "Only after righteousness does one take from others, and one is not sated in taking."

In former times, the eldest son of King Tai of Zhou was named Taibo. When the Great King fell ill, Taibo, out of righteousness, yielded his position. He went to gather medicine for his father and never returned. Later, King Ji established Taibo in Wu. One who is righteous must be able to yield; one who can yield must be able to harmonize. The king who treads righteousness and yielding must be able to harmonize the myriad states, reward the good and punish the evil, establish merit and accomplish deeds, and use righteousness to eliminate the unrighteous.

In former times, Jie was infatuated with Mo Xi and lost righteousness, thereby forfeiting virtue. Zhou was enamored of Daji and lost righteousness, thereby harming loyal worthies. King You of Zhou favored Bao Si, deviated from righteousness, and lost the feudal lords. Duke Xian of Jin delighted in Li Ji and ultimately lost righteousness toward his heir. Lady Zhuang Jiang of Zheng, in her excessive favor, caused Shu Duan to be unfilial. Pang Juan was jealous of the worthy and died as an unrighteous friend. Luo Fu drowned in the river, and Lu Hu forever became a husband who deviated from righteousness. Qu Yuan drowned in the Miluo, and King Huai of Chu became an unrighteous lord. Wu Zixu was aided by the washerwoman, and ultimately became a worthy scholar who upheld righteousness. There were those who struck the locust tree and cut their throats, who burned their eyes and lacquered their bodies in righteousness—Guan and Bao, Chen and Lei established righteous names that adorned the former histories.

Thus, we know that righteousness cannot be untrodden and cannot be deviated from. Confucius said: "Wealth and honor obtained through unrighteousness are to me like floating clouds." The former sages despised the unrighteous. If one dies through unrighteousness or abandons righteousness to live, then one treats life and death lightly—this is not worthy. One who can harmonize bones and flesh, brothers and kin, and treads righteousness in all things—what contention could there be? Therefore, the noble person takes righteousness as his essence, treads it, and acts—thus, there is surely no deviation.

**Master Su Lü on Wisdom**

Master Su Lü said: Wisdom is the virtue of water among the Five Phases. Water takes moistening and descending as its virtue; wisdom takes planning and consideration as its ability. Without consideration, wisdom has no ability; without moistening, water has no virtue. Thus, water flows without ceasing, and wisdom is used without obstruction. When water is turbid, it cannot reflect; when wisdom is disturbed, it cannot consider. It is not like still water that can be clear, settled wisdom that can be bright—when water is still and wisdom is settled, they are both clear and bright.

If water bursts its banks and does not cease, it will soak and cause harm; if wisdom is used improperly, it will confuse and invite disaster. The worthy employ wisdom to encompass the myriad things, like a mirror that reflects objects—beauty and ugliness are both seen. Within, it is like the bright moon in the sky, with springs and ponds all reflecting its light. It observes and illuminates the distant and near, clearly distinguishing right and wrong, knowing the hardships of the multitude, treasuring one’s own ease and joy, equalizing warmth and fullness in one body, and considering cold and hunger for the four peoples. Thus, it can employ wisdom to assist emperors and kings, devise plans to prevent treachery and harm.

Therefore, Zhang Liang and Chen Ping’s wisdom was comprehensive and they succeeded; Shang Yang and Su Qin’s wisdom was deceptive and they perished. Those who possess states and families, if they tread wisdom and can be bright and considerate, then calamities and misfortunes cannot reach them.

**Master Su Lü on Trustworthiness**

Master Su Lü said: Trustworthiness is what the great person values. If Heaven loses trustworthiness, the Three Luminaries are not bright; if Earth loses trustworthiness, the Four Seasons are not completed; if man loses trustworthiness, the Five Virtues do not function. Thus, Master Kong said: "A great cart has no yoke, a small cart has no crossbar—how can they travel?" This means that without trustworthiness, man cannot proceed.

Zigong asked about governance. The Master said: "Sufficient food, sufficient arms, and the people’s trust."

Zigong said: "If forced to relinquish one of these three, which should be abandoned first?"
The Master said: "Abandon arms."
Zigong said: "If forced to relinquish one of the remaining two, which should be abandoned first?"
The Master said: "Abandon food. Since ancient times, all must die; but without the people’s trust, the state cannot stand. In governing a state, trust must never be lost.

In former times, King You of Zhou faced threats from the Quanrong in the west and the Jiankang in the north. The king and the feudal lords established trust, agreeing that when beacon

**On Music**
*Master Su Lü* said: Music is the harmony of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons. Thus, the tuning of pitch-pipes regulates yin and yang, and the modulation of the five notes orders the four seasons. For this reason, the sage-kings of antiquity established rites and created music to transform the people.

Therefore:
- The Yellow Emperor’s music was called *Cloud Gate*,
- Zhuanxu’s *Six Classics*,
- Emperor Ku’s *Five Blossoms*,
- Yao’s *Universal Pond*,
- Shun’s *Great Shao*,
- Yu’s *Great Xia*,
- Tang’s *Great Hu*,
- King Wu’s *Great Martial*—

all eight generations of music, used to manifest their virtue and illuminate their achievements. Thus, Heaven and Earth and the four seasons all submitted to their transformation.

On the use of the eight sounds, the *Record of Music* states:
- The sound of bells is resonant; resonance establishes command, command establishes authority, authority establishes martial power. When a noble person hears the sound of bells, they think of martial ministers.
- The sound of chimes is direct; directness establishes distinction, distinction leads to death. When a noble person hears the sound of chimes, they think of ministers who die defending the frontiers.
- The sound of strings is mournful; its return establishes integrity, integrity establishes resolve. When a noble person hears the sound of zithers and lutes, they think of ministers of steadfast righteousness.
- The sound of bamboo is overflowing; overflow establishes assembly, assembly gathers the multitude. When a noble person hears the sound of reed pipes, panpipes, and flutes, they think of ministers who amass and nurture the people.
- The sound of drums is stirring; stirring establishes movement, movement advances the multitude. When a noble person hears the sound of war drums, they think of generals and commanders.

On the use of the five notes:
The five phases’ sounds regulate the vital qi. The *horn* of spring, with its clarity and depth, mirrors the image of the common people. When spring’s qi is harmonious, the *horn* note is well-tuned. The *Record of Music* says: "When the *horn* is disordered, there is sorrow—do the people not resent it?"
The *note* of summer, with its clarity, mirrors the image of diligent affairs. When summer’s qi is harmonious, the *note* is well-tuned. The *Record of Music* says: "When the *note* is disordered, there is grief—are affairs not toilsome?"
The *gong* of late summer, being the largest, mirrors the ruler’s image. The *Record of Music* says: "When the *gong* is disordered, there is dissipation—is the ruler not arrogant?"
The *shang* of autumn, with its depth, mirrors the image of secondary ministers. When autumn’s qi is harmonious, the *shang* is well-tuned. The *Record of Music* says: "When the *shang* is disordered, there is perversity—are ministers not corrupt?"
The *yu* of winter, being the clearest, mirrors the image of things refined. When winter’s qi is harmonious, the *yu* is well-tuned. The *Record of Music* says: "When the *yu* is disordered, there is danger—are resources not exhausted?"

These are the uses of the five notes and eight sounds, from which human emotions cannot escape. When used in sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, the celestial spirits descend and the earthly spirits ascend; when used in sacrifices to mountains and rivers, ghosts and spirits draw near; when used to transform the people, the populace is harmonious. Thus, when its measures are observed, music spreads and human relations are clarified, the ears and eyes become keen, the blood and qi are balanced, customs are reformed, and all under Heaven is at peace. When its measures are lost, the licentious music of Zheng and Wei arises, and the lewd airs of Mulberry Grove and Pu Shang spread. Therefore:
- The music of a well-ordered age is peaceful and joyful, for its governance is harmonious;
- The music of a disordered age is resentful and angry, for its governance is perverse;
- The music of a ruined state is mournful and longing, for its people are distressed.

Moreover, clarity is for the ruler, depth for the minister; clarity is yang, depth is yin. When clarity and depth are not disordered, ruler and minister are at peace, and yin and yang follow their proper order. The worthy listen to its sounds and know the state of governance.

Yet the Five Emperors, though their eras differed, did not inherit one another’s music; the Three Kings, though their dynasties varied, did not adopt one another’s rites. However, the essence of rites lies in reverence, and the essence of music lies in harmony—reverence and harmony are unchanging across ten thousand generations. Thus, rites restrain excess, and music curbs transgression. When rites are excessive, there is chaos; when music is excessive, there is licentiousness. To regulate music and halt licentiousness is the foundation of proper conduct.

**On Wealth and Nobility**
*Master Su Lü* said: Wealth and nobility are what all people desire, yet if obtained by improper means, one should not dwell in them. One should cultivate virtue to attain wealth and nobility. When wealth and nobility are obtained, one must maintain fullness and preserve achievement with reverence, frugality, humility, and deference; restrain expenditures and cherish others; master oneself and return to ritual; give without expecting repayment; bestow kindness without wasting resources; not overindulge in dwellings or adornments; in lean years, not be stingy; in abundant years, not be extravagant.

Thus, when Guan Zhong engraved his sacrificial vessels with cinnabar and adorned his carriage with mountain and algae patterns, the noble person deemed it excessive. When Yan Pingzhong offered his ancestors a pig’s shoulder that did not fill the dish and attended court in patched robes and a dusty cap, the noble person deemed it miserly. Therefore, the noble person, when in their proper station, practices the Way without transgressing into extravagance or parsimony that violates ritual; does not indulge excessively in music and sensual pleasures; does not greedily seize wealth and property; rejects arrogance and luxury; abandons excessive desires; reduces wine and restrains lust; avoids suspicion and distances doubt; aids others and benefits the people, bringing peace and harmony to the multitude. They constantly maintain a mind of humility and caution, never forgetting the aspirations of loyalty and filial piety.

The *Daoist Scripture* says: "One who knows contentment is rich."
The *Classic of Filial Piety* says: "Lofty yet not perilous—thus one long preserves nobility; full yet not overflowing—thus one long preserves wealth."
The *Book of Changes* says: "The Way of Heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Way of Earth alters the full and flows to the humble; ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the Way of Man detests the full and favors the humble. The humble are honored and radiant, lowly yet unassailable." It also says: "The laboriously humble noble person will have a good end."

**On Poverty and Lowliness**
*Master Su Lü* said: Poverty and lowliness are what all people detest, yet if one does not rid oneself of them by improper means, they should not be shunned. A scholar who is devoted to the Way yet ashamed of coarse clothes and poor food is not worth discussing. The noble person worries about the Way, not poverty; does not fear poverty but fears instability.

Of old, the old fisherman and the recluse of the thatched hut were poor yet attained enlightenment. Thus, Zixia’s patched robe, Yuan Xian’s mulberry-wood door pivot, and Yanzi’s single basket of food, single gourd of drink, vegetable fare, and water—resting his head on his bent arm—found joy therein. Zengzi straightened his cap though its strings snapped, put on his shoes though their heels were worn through, adjusted his robe though his elbows showed, and dragged his sandals while singing.

The *Shang Song* hymns resounded throughout the realm, resonant as metal and stone, such that even the Son of Heaven could not take their masters as ministers, nor could feudal lords claim them as friends. These were men who attained the Way at the cost of their lives, or nurtured their aspirations at the cost of their fates—all of them poor yet rejoicing in the Dao.

Some planted five willows by their gates, or cultivated three mulberry trees in their courtyards, singing as they tapped their horns, chanting as they gathered firewood—all were scholars who trod the path of poverty. The worthy, when employed, returned home bearing only a load of earth; when dismissed, they left behind even their calves, ever distant from the three delusions and early cautious of the four kinds of knowledge. Such were the incorruptible scholars who embraced poverty.

Some forsook gold to preserve treasures, abandoned profit to uphold their words, disdaining the snail’s dwelling yet guarding their thatched huts, drinking water and eating greens, upholding the Way and content in poverty—these were the most virtuous and lofty of scholars. Confucius said: "He who does not understand fate cannot be a noble person." Fate determines one’s rise or fall, and all one can do is delight in Heaven and know one’s destiny. Those who crave courage to despise poverty, or seek gain before wealth, are not true noble persons. To emulate the footsteps of the wise and sagely, one must not be ashamed of a threadbare robe or a humble gate with a jade-like chink.

**Treading Level Ground**
Master Plain Tread said: The function of a steelyard lies in its balance; the movement of a cart depends on its ruts. When the balance is level, not even a hair’s breadth is amiss; when the ruts are clear, the axle and hub glide without obstruction. If the steelyard errs by a hair’s breadth, the weights and measures lose their correctness; if the axle and hub are flawed, the cart’s tracks become impassable. To keep the steelyard level, one must be vigilant in the minutest detail; to keep the ruts clear, one must tend to the axle and hub. When not even a hair’s breadth is lost and the axle and hub remain unmarred, this is called the equilibrium of Heaven and the completion of Earth.

This draws from the *Yi Jing*’s image of Heaven above and marsh below, where the noble person treads to distinguish high and low and settle the people’s aspirations. The utility of treading lies in dwelling in safety while contemplating danger, treading level ground while fearing stumbles. Thus the *Rites* say: "Accumulate yet be able to disperse; be at ease yet able to adapt." This is how the noble person treads level ground while pondering advancement. Master Zhang’s *Plain Book* states: "One who does not lift the collar of his robe wears it upside down; one who does not watch the ground while walking will stumble." If a scholar indulges in idleness, covets wealth and sensuality, craves wine, or harbors private desires, then even level ground will sprout pits and snares, and safe dwellings will harbor peril and ruin.

Thus the *Yi Jing* says: "The noble person, to the end of the day, remains diligent and cautious, as if facing danger." It also says: "Treading the Way with ease, the reclusive person’s steadfastness brings good fortune." Therefore the *Odes* say: "They say Heaven is high—dare I not crouch? They say Earth is thick—dare I not tread?" All this is like treading thin ice over deep waters—this is the perfection of treading level ground.

**Treading Peril**
Master Plain Tread said: In times of *Zhun* and *Meng*, peril and difficulty are ever-present. The *Yi Jing*’s *Image* says: "Clouds and thunder form *Zhun*—the noble person weaves and orders." The first nine: "Hesitating, it is advantageous to dwell in steadfastness." Again, one sees peril beneath the mountain, and halts in danger—this is *Meng*. To retreat is to be trapped in peril; to advance is to be blocked by the mountain. *Meng* is for nurturing correctness—this is the work of the sage.

The noble person, through resolute action, cultivates virtue. The utility of *Zhun* lies in dwelling in steadfastness; the advantage of *Meng* lies in nurturing correctness. Thus, steadfastness and correctness enable one to traverse peril and difficulty. When Yu Shun lived in obscurity in Zhongyi, his benevolent and filial heart only grew firmer; when the Duke of Zhou went forth to campaign in the east, his loyal and sincere resolve only intensified. Zhan Qin was thrice dismissed yet never ceased his upright ways; Ziwen was thrice relieved of office yet never uttered a resentful word. King Wen was imprisoned in Youli, yet his virtuous power shone ever brighter; Ye Chang was bound in fetters, yet his worthy conduct remained unsullied. Confucius, though besieged in Kuang, never altered his benevolence and sageliness; though distressed in Chen, he never ceased playing his zither.

The noble person does not rejoice at good fortune nor fear calamity. Unstained by defilement, his pure and white virtue shines ever brighter; uncarved and unyielding, his clear and steadfast integrity grows ever more vigorous. The *Odes* say: "My heart is not a stone—it cannot be turned; my heart is not a mat—it cannot be rolled up." And again: "Though wind and rain darken the sky, the cock crows on without cease." Such were the sages and worthies, who long pondered the *Ode of the Crow and Magpie* and the *Rhapsody of the Roc and Crow*.

Yet treading on a tiger’s tail inspires trembling fear; traversing peril and difficulty demands cautious vigilance. The *Yi Jing* says: "Observe one’s tread and examine its omens—returning thus brings supreme good fortune." And again: "To advance and retreat without losing correctness—is this not the mark of the sage?" The Way of treading is thus flourishing.

*Plain Tread, Lower Scroll* concludes.
