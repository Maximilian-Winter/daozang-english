**The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions**

**Scripture Title:** *The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions*
Authored by Lü Pure Yang of the Tang dynasty. Two fascicles.
Source edition: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section.

**Preface to *The Perfected One of Pure Yang’s Spontaneous Compositions***

I observe that the ancients did not compose with intent, and thus their words arose from sincerity, preserving the great essence in full. Later generations, however, wrote with the aim of fame, so their words surpassed their true feelings, and ornamental flourishes prevailed.

The great essence is rooted in spontaneity, while ornamental flourishes arise from contrivance. Spontaneity aligns with Heaven, whereas contrivance is shaped by human artifice. The expression of the heart’s voice knows no bounds—its distinctions are self-evident without speech.

Behold: it blazes forth as sun and moon, manifests as the Milky Way, coalesces into mountains and rivers, scatters as grasses and trees. Gazing above and below, the myriad forms stand in perfect array—all are the patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth. Yet in the great transformations of Heaven and Earth, where is there room for deliberate intent? They arise without speech, transform without action, for there is an inevitability that unfolds of itself.

Our patriarch, the Perfected One Lü Pure Yang, mastered the learning that bridges Heaven and humanity, wielding the mechanism of creation itself. His words flowed effortlessly from his lips, his brushstrokes formed chapters without strain—never the product of cunning thought or calculated design, but rather the spontaneous effusion of celestial impulse, an irresistible outpouring.

In his exhortations to the world, he adapted his teachings to all circumstances, his language plain yet his meaning profound. Those who read them find their doubts dissolved like melting ice, their minds at ease in the natural order. Greed is tempered, shallowness deepened, and the heart stirs with thoughts of leaving the dust of the world behind.

In his sword-condemning verses, he borrowed objects to illuminate truth, his qi bold and his spirit unbound. Those who read them feel their four limbs released, their spirits clear and their qi at ease. The filth is scraped away, the light polished, and the mind soars with longing for the heavens.

The Transcendent Elder’s divine transformations were boundless, his manifestations infinite. His writings, scattered among the people, cannot be fully gathered or exhaustively presented. Yet within the repository of the canon, I have found over two hundred of his poems and verses, which I have arranged into two fascicles, naming them *Spontaneous Compositions*—for they are perfectly formed by Heaven, beyond the reach of human artifice.

The stewards of the Pure Yang Abbey have proposed carving woodblocks to disseminate this work widely, that all under Heaven may share in it. Thus, they have asked me to compose this preface. Though I am unworthy, I have reluctantly complied, offering these rough outlines.

Within these verses, ambiguities akin to miswritten characters may appear here and there. How dare I presume to alter them with my own judgment? What is doubtful shall be transmitted as doubtful, awaiting the discernment of the wise.

Alas! If one can seek the poet’s heart through his poems, grasp his conduct through his heart, and from his conduct ascend to the Dao of the sages—might this not approach the Way? I cannot help but place my hopes in the keen and learned.

Written on the full moon of the intercalary tenth month in the year *qing-xinhai*, by the Pure and True Daoist of Tiaoyang, He Zhiyuan, with bowed head and reverent salute.

**Preface.**

**Volume One of *Spontaneous Compositions* by the Pure Yang Perfected**
**Twenty-Nine Seven-Character Regulated Verses of Exhortation to the World**

One must not cling to the clamor of the dust;
Within this illusory body dwells the Dharma-body.
Do not hoard brocade in your breast,
But cherish your spirit amid the world’s snares.

Return, and seek the songs of the immortals;
If lost, you’ll ne’er escape the bonds of the mundane.
I tell this to the wise and heroic:
Do not let your original truth be obscured.

Riding the whale, he emerges from Dongting Lake—
Who recognizes the carefree hermit weary of the world?
Ten thousand golden lotuses bloom in primordial chaos,
A single moon of the heart mirrors the Void.

He seeks not to dwell in the Yellow Gold Palace,
But only that men abide in the White Jade Flask.
With a green serpent tucked in his sleeve, he departs,
His phoenix flute sounding as he treads the celestial capital.

Starlight gleams, resplendent in verse,
His body drifts with idle clouds, leaving the imperial realm.
A single elixir refined beyond the world,
A hundred poems raved in drunken ecstasy.

Within the flask-sky lies the land of eternal spring,
On the island of immortals, is there no hall of endless night?
He treads the path beyond the azure clouds,
Proud as Fuxi in the ninth heaven.

Beneath towering trees, their shade deepens the sunset glow,
The finest mountains belong to the Daoist’s home.
Cold ashes warm the cauldron, flames rekindle,
Withered trees take root again, blossoms bloom.

The rise and fall of the mortal world are finite,
But the years of the jade palace stretch boundless.
Heavenly winds stir jade pendants to chime,
As he soars to and fro in a purple phoenix chariot.

Failing to awaken, the world remains coarse and clamorous,
Returning empty-handed from the mountain of treasures.
At the temples, black hair turns to snow,
The rosy face, in an instant, becomes ashen.

Strive to compose a thousand-year tune in your heart,
For the four illusions have never granted a day’s respite.
How many aspirations, inscribed on pillars and bridges,
Are yet imprisoned by the gate of life and death?

The cloud-wandering Daoist lives at ease,
The yellow dust beyond his gate never dries.
His mind-seal transmits the moon a thousand miles,
His topknot bears the Five Peaks and the Seven Stars’ crown.

He unfolds secret scrolls, burning incense as he recites,
Plucks the zither to his shadow, for none know its tune.
The red-crested crane stirs by the alchemical furnace—
One might suspect a golden elixir has taken flight.

The Void is vast, boundless,
Yet only the divine radiance ascends and descends.
A single poetic soul, newly forged of qi,
The five-thousand-word teaching, an old family tradition.

While deluded, study the ways of the mortal world;
When enlightened, cultivate deeds beyond the physical.
Spread your wings to ride the wind and return—
Do not let yourself be easily trapped in the cage of the ordinary.

Majestic and vast, descending from the celestial court,
The withered scene stirs melancholy.
The willow camp lies deep, mosquito legions thick,
The Yangtze’s waves stretch wide, mirage towers loom.

Wine banners twist like battle standards,
Flutes and drums echo as war drums.
Countless souls chase fame and profit—
How many will glimpse true peace?

The red gates must not long delay;
Before profit grows, harm has already multiplied.
Do not let your sharp wit become a sword,
But calm your heart and still the winds of strife.

The bee, in its folly, gathers flowers into honey;
The silkworm dies—who will weave its cocoon into silk?
Wealth gained unjustly is greed’s gain—
What end awaits such floating clouds?

See through the workings of fate’s ebb and flow,
Empty your heart and live at ease.
Moonlight fills the peaks above and below,
Spiritual forms traverse the seven-jeweled mountains.

Gathering heaven and earth into your palm,
You move the sun and moon, shaking the celestial gates.
The teeming masses remain unseen—
A single mysterious pearl shines in the world.

The dream of yellow millet ends, all things cease,
Mist and waves hide the mirage towers.
After three thousand days of refining lead and mercury,
He leaps beyond yin and yang, eight hundred autumns.

His sword hangs south of the Dipper, north of the Chief Star,
His qi spans the heavens, brushing the moon’s edge.
He came grasping a flawless mirror,
High in the azure sky, yet unwilling to withdraw it.

The weave of yin and yang holds the power of creation,
Yet the human heart is often restless.
Suddenly, the Milky Way becomes a river of clouds,
The snowy sky turns to rain.

The ice-fish steals warmth, floating on jade wings,
The plum blossom, in the cold, vies in beauty.
Pity the fleeting scene of eternal spring—
Who will bring it to the world?

The crane’s path stretches far,
Its song compels, its purity overwhelms.
The plum’s soul is stolen by the wind,
The bamboo’s shadow is cast by the moon.

The good mountain is known to delight the benevolent,
Fine wine suits the old man’s heart.
With whom shall I escape the net of the world,
And wander the paradise gardens in peace?

I recall riding the wind beneath the jade canopy,
Fragrant clouds thickly veiling the dragon chariot.
I awaited the gathering of immortals in the Penglai gardens,
Drunk, I slept in the mountain hermit’s home.

Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream is truly savored,
The deer mistaken for Zheng’s minister—how lamentable!
Who can grasp this mystery’s delight,
And together sail the Silver River on a moonlit night?

Do not neglect the spiritual source, plant descendants,
Preserve the mandate of return and the root of home.
Withdraw, and do not summon the Shushan courtesans,
Hold simplicity, and do not open the northern sea’s cup.

The purple phoenix has not yet ridden to the crimson palace,
The black-robed one has already shed the red gates.
I wish you would not steal the starving people’s grain,
But follow me to repay the Jade Emperor’s grace.

The blessings of past lives are seen in the present,
The causes of future lives are observed now.
Only after three lifetimes of wisdom does one become an official,
Only after five births of clarity does one hold office.

Do not plant thorns in the garden of your heart,
Do not let weapons loose from your wit’s tip.
Take up the sword of wisdom and return—
Spare yourself the battles of hunger and cold.

Half-drunk, half-sober, I leave the divine capital,
The rivers and mountains remain dim, the sky unbright.
Dharma rain briefly follows the torrential downpour,
Compassion clouds idly drift with the evening mist.

The dust of the world has settled,
Beyond the physical, the Dao’s power flourishes in hidden growth.

The Dao’s power flourishes as worldly dust settles,
Within the spirit’s terrace, all rejoice in pure tranquility.
Sacred virtue and mortal passions cannot align—
A light rod vainly cast toward the sea’s heart.

A single line dangles fragrant bait,
On Qili Shoal’s rocks, the angler sits.
Bright moon fills the sky o’er crimson shores,
Clear wind brushes sleeves of green straw cloak.
Water cold, night still—no fish are caught,
Laughing, he points to the Yangtze and sighs *shiwei*.

Sun and moon hasten forth, then return west,
Turning heads, the years flow by the hundreds and thousands.
Do not chase yin demons to dissolve cinnabar,
But refine golden lead within the elixir crucible.
In the dust, fear only tardy retreat;
Beyond the physical, act swiftly first.
Shatter this hollow void,
Then brush your sleeves and ascend the clouded peaks.

A limpid stream from the ancient numinous source,
Unsullied by even a speck of dust.
Bright, bright—like the radiant moon,
Leisurely, leisurely—as idle clouds.
Split open heaven and earth’s cage and net,
Leap beyond yin-yang’s creative pass.
In the mundane realm, some may briefly awaken—
Turning the light inward, home lies before your face.

The true nature was ever free,
Let not worldly affairs forcibly confine it.
In the waves of right and wrong, best seal your lips;
In the arena of fame and gain, withdraw your head.
Debts to kin and karmic ties—now settled,
The paths of life and death—now at rest.
Beneath the azure crags and verdant pines, carefree,
Watching fading blossoms drift upon the stream.

A pellet of elixir, long refined to joy,
Shines brilliantly, high as Kunlun’s peaks.
The benevolent cauldron tames dragon and tiger,
Opening the furnace startles ghosts and gods.
Vast enough to embrace heaven and earth—yet still too narrow,
Fine as dust and sand—yet not too full.
Touch a stubborn stone, and gold is made;
Why then do men fail to attain immortality?

The Dragon Spring sword, forged without counting autumns,
Preserves the Dharma-nature in perfect wholeness.
Divine radiance leaves its sheath, illuminating sun and moon,
Cold flames pierce the clouds, striking the Dipper and Ox.
Wielded, it purifies the ten directions and three realms;
Brandished, a hundred demons and myriad fiends lament.
Sent by decree from the Celestial Capital,
It is bestowed upon the valiant of the human world.

Before Yellow Crane Tower, the Lü family’s home,
A gourd holds heaven and earth, aging with rosy clouds.
Formless white deer harmonize with crimson phoenixes,
A black tortoise coils around a scarlet serpent.
In June, white snow flies on mountain peaks;
In midwinter, yellow sprouts grow beneath the waters.
If men but recognized these principles,
Land-bound immortals would swarm like hemp.

Eyes meet a thousand differences, ten thousand things—
Yet a single point before the breast anchors serene leisure.
Knowing the truth is like the moon in meditation,
Never return empty-handed from the treasure mountain.
Wide sleeves sweep away affliction’s barriers,
Straw sandals tread through the gates of life and death.
Once this move is set in place,
No longer subject to yin-yang’s playful questions.

Rosy clouds drift, veiling the immortal palace,
Vast qi surges, filling the great void.
A lotus stem holds the Milky Way’s moon,
The roc soars ten thousand miles on sea and mountain winds.
Spiritual light reflects beyond primordial heaven,
The perfect circle embraces the Great Dao.
Nearby stands the White Prime Lord,
Yet worldly men, lost in busyness, cannot fathom him.

Advancing, do not covet what is unjust;
Retreating, recognize your original truth.
Practice compassion, accumulate boundless merit;
Curb desire, spare your finite body.
Green temples can only turn to white hair,
Red dust never again meets youth’s spring.
If you fully grasp these wild words,
Become a carefree being beyond the physical.

Who among the Luofu Daoists shares this path?
Clad in grass, fed on wood, they scorn kings and lords.
The world’s sixty-year cycles cannot bind them,
Within their gourds, heaven and earth are free.
Counting moves in a lingering chess game as the river moon dawns,
A long whistle heralds autumn over sea and mountain.
After drinking, turning to speak of the return,
They point afar to white clouds at the sky’s edge.

The celestial net is vast, myriad forms sparse—
A single pine falls, and Mount Hua withers.
After cold clouds disperse, a waning moon remains;
When winter snow arrives, it vanishes into the void.
Ten caves’ dragons and serpents return to the Purple Palace,
A thousand years’ simurghs and phoenixes alight on Cangwu.
Since parting from the Master,
North, south, east, west—few true men remain.

**Five-Character Regulated Verse**

Night still on the cold river,
Line reeled in, waves gather.
Alas, too few fragrant baits,
Vainly watching brocaded scales teem.
Planning to turn the boat back,
Yet still ensnared by the scene.
Lingering beneath the bright moon,
In vain, the old fisher’s cloak.

To reach the realm of cultivating truth,
One must rely on the power of creation.
The Azure Dragon swallows purple mist,
The White Tiger exhales blue smoke.
Luminous qi rises through the three realms,
Yang light pierces the nine springs.
A single pellet of elixir is complete—
Returning to the state before birth.

**Seven-Character Quatrains**

Do not prize glory and cling to ministerial rank,
In forests and springs, one may hide anywhere.
You know those who once fled Qin—
Now dwell as people within Peach Blossom Spring.

Red gates pilfer profit, endlessly scheming,
Coming as foam, going as waves.
Even reaching the Jade Hall as chief minister,
Who today remains like Xiao He of Han?

Felling the numinous root, exhausting true essence,
Beneath the skull’s face, seeking spirit.
Meeting, all say they seek immortality—
Yet who has ever seen one on Penglai Isle?

Gathering true essence, nurturing the elixir,
The inch of heart unobstructed, naturally at ease.
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, longing for return,
A purple phoenix delivers a letter to the world.

Grass’s shade fades, earth’s thunder roars,
Stars and constellations stretch across ten thousand miles.
Calling back Pure Yang to its rightful place,
Just before noon, the third watch is heard.

A human life spans ten thousand kalpas of cultivation,
Why toil endlessly for family worries?
In the end, leave it to sons and grandsons to reckon—
What reason to labor like oxen and horses?

Dragons weary of roaring, tigers of roaring,
The general still has not doffed his armor.
Furious winds sweep the earth, overturning heaven,
Shaking the cosmos, killing qi soars high.

Shatter the void and seize it at once,
Seizing it is best for one’s livelihood.
Not seeking the head-covered path of silent meditation,
Mocking the old masters who came from the West.

Do not boast of youth’s gallantry,
Striving and struggling, trading in bones.
If unconvinced, try gazing into a bright mirror—
Beneath the skin, only a skeleton remains.

When the heart turns from avarice, contemplate the true Dao;
When the eyes turn from beauty, gaze toward Wuling.
On the wrist that plucks osmanthus, cast off the jade clasp;
On the feet that tread clouds, untie the bonds of favor.

The people have long been trapped in warfare,
Not in furrowed brows or sighing voices.
A safe haven lies just ahead,
Yet men’s hearts remain unsettled, unpeaceful.

Wooden idols, clay statues—still forms in quietude,
Let the mind’s realm remain unstained by even a speck of dust.
Silent and profound, without interruption,
This flavor accords with the Perfect Truth.

Ask not of the clamor in the marketplace,
For beyond its dust lie misty mountains.
If only the heart’s square inch remains free of the slightest shadow,
One gains a realm of leisure within the celestial gourd.

Xiao He of Han was buried in the earth,
Cao Zhi’s literary fame brought him only sorrow.
Reflecting on this desolate world,
It is far better to return home.

I admire the white-haired elder, so worthy,
A man of kindness, refined in manner and bearing.
How might one invite him to ride the wind away,
To become master of the clouds and mountains?

Children’s clothing and sustenance are sought by children,
In vain does greed force one to thrust forward.
Only when sorrow arrives and years come to an end,
Does resentment turn level ground into barren mounds.

Living in humble poverty is no disgrace,
While lofty prominence is no true strength.
Observe the days of peace and tranquility—
Who remains, and who has perished?

**Against Wine**
Beware wine, beware wine,
Preserve the primal radiance within.
Soaring freely to the Jade Capital Peak,
Heaven and earth brew nectar aplenty.

**Against Lust**
Beware lust, beware lust,
The moment desire arises, the primordial spirit perishes.
Naturally, in the Jade Hall of matrimony,
A single spark of spirit outshines a thousand feet of snow.

**Against Greed**
Beware wealth, beware wealth,
Let it not bury the world’s people in suffering.
Within the Seven Treasures of one’s own forest,
A true person builds a tower of jade.

**Against Anger**
Beware wrath, beware wrath,
It may be gentle but must not be abandoned.
One day, when it surges and transforms into the primordial spirit,
It will ascend the azure heavens to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.

**Against Sorrow**
Beware sorrow, beware sorrow,
How long will the relentless pursuit of fame and profit last?
Glory, wealth, and honor—how long can they endure?
When the limit arrives, how can they be retained?

**The Heart-Sword**
I possess a Longquan sword, sheathed and hidden,
Its light polishes men’s livers and gallbladders, brightening their spirits.
Once drawn and raised in the central palace,
Demons a thousand miles away dare not stand before it.

**The Heart-Seal**
Cold light, unmoving, naturally so,
Adapting to all, now square, now round.
Once stamped, one knows there is no "that,"
This life is but the state before birth.

**The Heart-Mirror**
High upon the spirit terrace, long unpolished,
It naturally reflects the ten thousand forms.
Let dust settle without blowing—
If blown, what does the dust reveal?

**The Heart-Lamp**
A single flame of the heart-lamp burns brightly,
No need to tend it—it shines of itself.
When obtained, it illuminates the darkness of the world,
Radiating cold light throughout the Great Purity.

**The Heart-Moon**
A single wheel of the heart-moon adheres to the celestial court,
The hare’s spirit and toad’s soul are exceptionally clear.
Even a wisp of idle cloud cannot obscure it,
It penetrates heaven and earth, perfectly round.

**The Heart-Ground**
The heart-ground requires no laborious plowing,
In stillness, the sprouts of the Dao alone grow.
Once I have filled all its ravines,
It rests in serene tranquility, a level expanse.

**The Most Profound Song**
Why did I spend six years on Snow Ridge?
With resolve firm, harmonizing qi and spirit.
In a hundred moments, all is but a single breath—
Only then does the Great Dao reveal the Three Vehicles.

The Jade Emperor sent me to transform the foolish,
Yet the world’s people remain distant from the Dao.
The four seasons stealthily steal the treasures of the body,
The five agents openly plunder the pearls upon the face.

Year after year, the pursuit of fame and profit persists,
Day by day, right and wrong depart and vanish.
Turning back, I return to the path of the Three Isles,
Lest the Emperor send down a celestial talisman.

Refining cinnabar through nine cycles of firing,
The fire’s timing naturally unfurls the child’s blossom.
From the stars, the blue lotus seed is forged,
Beneath the sun and moon, the white horse’s sprout is nurtured.

Seven returns transform into verdant mist,
Nine reversals culminate in crimson clouds.
Whoever seizes the Mysterious Pearl as sustenance,
Finds the path to the Three Isles not far.

In the West, the Jade Maiden gives birth to golden sprouts,
For heaven and earth’s fire burns of itself.
The Water Tiger lies beneath the clouded mountains,
The Fire Dragon scatters its hues across the sea.

When the yang soul flourishes, heaven is not distant,
As the yin spirit conjoins, earth is not far.
Once merit is complete, the five colors naturally arise,
Riding the simurgh, one freely ascends the cloudy heavens.

Heaven engenders one flavor, transforming the Three Powers,
As yin and yang interact, the sacred embryo forms.
Dragon and Tiger proceed in order, the yin ghost flees,
Tortoise and Serpent reverse course, the Fire Dragon arrives.

The infant shares the golden marrow,
The Crone pours the white jade cup.
Once merit is complete, one naturally transcends the mundane,
In the world, the cycles of cold and heat pass unheeded.

Stars gather in the Li region,
The waxing and waning of sun and moon aid the Medicine King.
For three periods, fire refines the golden tripod’s treasure,
Five talismans and water temper the jade flask’s nectar.

Heaven and earth overturn, the Dragon brings rain,
At Mao and You, the Tiger devours and radiates light.
Entering the chamber, employ the mechanism to seize and capture—
A single pill of cinnabar, the medicine of pure yang.

The Eight Trigrams communicate with Kan and Li,
When Zhen and Dui interact, the Two Modes unite.
When taking action, seize the moment of supremacy,
Refine and fire until ripe—do not delay.

Eighty-one years within the womb,
To refine pure yang through eighty-one cycles.
Riding clouds by day, returning to the upper realms,
Even now, I wander and rest in the Purple Tenuity Palace.

Within the gourd, the Four Images are naturally divine,
Yet they are said to rule the people for ages.
Though employing weapons to pacify the cosmos,
The two wheels of sun and moon still traverse ceaselessly.

Why labor with multitudes to still the world?
North and south doors now stand open to each other.
This employs none other than Dragon and Tiger,
Eightfold divine light shines through to the very bottom.

Each must arise from each,
True gold meets and contends.
Where the yang soul ends, yin must disperse,
Transforming into the essence of heaven and earth, sun and moon.

The Five Agents must pair as husband and wife,
The Kan man and Li woman—few understand.
When the two bodies interact and harmonize,
Then the Elder of Bing becomes the true elder.

Year after year, the method for changing bones differs,
One must refine Dragon and Tiger at the center.
When merit is complete, it takes but three thousand days,
Blood transforms into jasper, marrow into frost.

The essence of the Five Agents is contained within one,
Arranged in cycles, awaiting the fire’s timing.
Only when water returns to the spirit chamber,
Does one ascend from level ground to the azure heavens.

The Northern House holds the Li image, the Kan House bears its bloom,
Further binding the eastern neighbor, where the Zhen’s inner sprout grows.
Whenever the Elder of Bing draws near to guide,
They must wrestle within the furnace’s embrace.

The Four Symbols cycle in reverence to Wu and Ji,
Cultivating tranquility—all hinges on the sovereign’s will.
Metal and Wood converge as Water and Fire unite,
A single streak of crimson radiance bridges the cavernous expanse.

Cherish the single grain of elixir within the flask,
Treasured deep in the secluded grotto of Kun Mountain.
This is no common herb for mortal inquiry—
Once ingested, the body joins the ranks of the sages.

The alchemical process demands nine revolutions,
Tiger and Dragon’s numbers fulfilled, fire propels them on.
At once, one advances in the Dao, standing before the court,
Fierce and swift, relying on the Xun gate’s breath.

Pounding and blending find no path when timing is amiss,
Resolve lies in wholehearted, meticulous observation.
The chaste maiden surely knows within the raven’s shadow,
The infant brother dwells only at the moon’s edge.

Within the mystery, the path grows ever more profound,
Painstaking words fail—it lies beyond all speech.
Should the moment come with no clear choice,
How can one glimpse the root without a gateway?

Nurture the brother’s form to mirror my own,
My body withers while the child’s essence shines.
Generation after generation, ever thus—
How could it compare to preserving spirit and cultivating the self?

**Five-Word Extended Verse**
*A Hundred-Character Poem*

My nature delights in purity and stillness,
Preserving the heart’s source in steadfastness.
Wealth—I do not covet,
Qi—I do not contend.

Wine—when have I ever drunk?
Desire for sensual pleasures—already extinguished.
What I see, as if unseen,
What I hear, as if unheard.

Never speak of others’ faults,
Only seek my own afflictions.
No name binds me in officialdom,
In private, I act by trust alone.

When encountering gain, not frivolous,
When facing absence, I hold to my duty.
Not trapped in another’s shell,
I dispel the gloom within my heart.

Harmonizing light while mingling with the dust,
I blend with worldly sentiments.
Why not vie for fame?
Once discussed with lofty souls.

**Five-Word Regulated Verse**
*Self-Reflection*

**Five-Word Quatrains**

**Mountain Immortal**
A mountain immortal, unknown to all,
Girds his sword and enters the Great Tang.
Turning his head to gaze south and north,
He has no intent to return home.

**Yesterday at Nimo Temple**
Yesterday at Nimo Temple,
Early I sensed my robes turn yellow.
A black wind swept through in a gust—
A hundred ghosts all hid in silence.

**The Qin**
Seven strings unleash refined melodies,
Ten fingers pour forth the wind through pines.
Awakening from this floating-life dream,
The moon, serene, imprints the empty sky.

**Chess**
Black and white—my heart cannot decide,
When have I ever faced it at leisure?
Within the kalpa, myriad paths are perilous,
Life and death hang on a single move.

**Calligraphy**
Grieving the fall of Zhou’s latter days,
Scholars still search in vain.
Each bears benevolence and wisdom,
Yet who attains the heart of Confucius?

**Painting**
How lovely the hand of the artist,
Master of boundless samādhi’s power.
How many scenes of rivers and mountains—
All held within a single inch of heart.

---

**Four-Word Quatrains**

**Purity**
A single thought does not arise,
Whence could the myriad illusions spring?
Vast and empty, boundless—
Moon pale, wind clear.

**Stillness**
External realms do not intrude,
The inner spirit settles of itself.
A single point of numinous light—
Luminous, still, and bright.

**Dao/Way**
The principle of non-action runs deep,
Seeking it, one delves ever further.
Yet grasp it with an unforced hand—
This is called the Dao/Way.

**Virtue/Power**
Virtue, too, has no form,
Yet nothing it does not nurture.
When all things bear their bloom,
This is true virtue/power.

**Action**
Though the dharma-realm is vast,
It may be traversed and transcended.
Step with feet in the pure wind,
Grasp the bright moon in your hand.

**Abiding**
In motion, words fail,
In stillness, speech is void.
Forget both motion and stillness—
Rest here in the midst.

**Sitting**
The heart extinguished like cold ash,
The body forgotten like clod of earth.
Silent, dark, and profound—
Radiance illumines the three realms.

**Reclining**
The family tradition of purity,
The wondrous secret of the unseen and unheard.
Release the four great elements—
The myriad illusions all dissolve.

---

**Six-Word Poems**

Spring’s warmth, half-opened blossoms,
Wandering at ease upon the stone.
Alone I hold jade precepts and golden secrets,
Leisurely treading green moss and emerald moss.

Nineteen years I slept in an ancient cave,
Drank flowing radiance by the thousand cups.
When meeting others, speak not of worldly affairs—
Laughing, point to the white clouds’ comings and goings.

---

**Song of the Fallen**
Fallen, ah fallen—
At night, lodging in rustic villages,
By day, roaming the city walls.
When idle, I wander the verdant mountains,
When bored, peddle elixirs in the marketplace.

The coins I earn, not counted,
Spent on fine wine, poured for myself.
Drunk, my chants shake ghosts and gods,
Carefree as the sun sinks in the west.

---

**Seven-Word Regulated Verses**

**The Perfected One’s Departure**
When merits are complete, salvation’s meeting is hard to come by,
Again I hear you must depart from Apricot Immortal’s Altar.
At your staff’s tip, spring’s hues—a gourd of wine,
Atop your head, clouds pierce the Five Peaks’ crown.

The sea-turtle child, none recognize,
The mountain-burning talisman, ghosts dare not behold.
After the master’s gone, this body must age—
I beg you, give this poor scholar a bone-transforming elixir.

**The Golden Elixir**
A single grain of golden elixir ensures long life,
But true lead must refine the cyclical stems.
Fire draws the red phoenix’s marrow from the south,
Water seeks the black turtle’s essence from the northern sea.

The crucible follows the four seasons, uniting at the center,
The medicine moves with the three primals and eight trigrams.
After fasting and purifying, refine it nine times—
Know then that upon entering the mouth, gods and ghosts will tremble.

**The Perfected One by the Emerald Pool**
By the emerald pool, a true person appears,
His face like peach blossoms, his body like silver.
His temples show no gray—he has the art,
His complexion stays young—he has attained the divine.

Now is the time to ascend Penglai,
The yellow robes on the rack turn to clouds.
Though mulberry fields may turn to seas,
A single pill of elixir secures a thousand springs.

**Refining Cinnabar**
The furnace nurtures cinnabar—no gray at the temples,
Why trouble with fame and profit, dwelling among men?
I have met the perfected and received the divine medicine,
And rejoice with fellow seekers, smiling as we move.

Laozi’s Dao has been entrusted to me,
The Lesser Star permits me to ascend with it.
Fortunate to be gathered by the lofty ones,
In this world, I yield to you a life of leisure.

**Who Waits for Immortality?**
Who waits for immortality to be bestowed upon me?
I refine true qi within the immortal embryo.
I know well that I shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight,
Yet I have just descended into the red dust of the world.

When the White Tiger moves, rain and dew pour,
Where the Red Dragon plows, jasper and jade appear.
Swallow but a single grain of cinnabar medicine—
I shall soar into the azure clouds and never return.

**The Hidden Sage**
Amid the tumbled clouds, the starry capital appears,
Discerning the deeply concealed true man.
Drunk on green wine, he sleeps through sun and moon,
When the white duckweed’s wind stills, he fishes by rivers and lakes.

Ever aligning his bearing with heaven’s Dao,
He does not waste words on the world’s paths.
The mountain and water roads are distant, none reach them—
Do the reeds and thatch hold any news?

**The Crane as Chariot**
The crane serves as chariot, wine as provisions,
Transforming this into the land of long life, undying.
Even earth’s veins can be shortened,
How can human life not be made to lengthen?

In his hairpin, stars and constellations often appear,
Beneath his robe, sun and moon are often concealed.
If the common folk wish to meet him in person,
Day after day, they must not leave the path of mercury.

**The Magic Mushroom**
The magic mushroom has no seed, no root,
Yet it can be drunk, consumed, and revive the soul.
As long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,
Let the crow and hare race through the cosmos.

The infant only clings to the mother in the yang,
The crone must face the honored one atop her head.
Once attained, it does not return for a thousand ages—
No tombs or graves will be left for descendants.

**Who Understands These Words?**
Who in this world understands these words?
Do not hang fame and profit upon your heart’s field.
Casually pour out wine to the full,
When inspired, chant a hundred verses.

Beyond the world, mist and rosy clouds are my companions,
Within the gourd, sun and moon follow the fair one.
When the time comes and merits are complete, where shall I return?
I shall ride the cloud chariot straight into the grotto-heaven.

**The Emperor’s Son of the Mysterious Gate**
The Emperor’s Son of the Mysterious Gate sits at the center,
His life long and luminous, moved by the Jade Sovereign.
The world’s mountains and rivers harmonize with rain and dew,
Within his sleeve, sun and moon merge with Xiao and Xiang.

The Kan male is betrothed to the Jin family’s daughter,
The Li female, wedded in triumph, marries the Wooden Lad.
Truly, if husband and wife can hold fast to their resolve,
They shall establish teachings to entangle yin and yang.

**Retreat from the Mortal Frame**
How many years have passed since I shed my mortal frame?
Beyond the high green peaks, I feed on the mysterious frost.
Ancient snow on the blue mountains encircles my pine couch,
Cold clouds from the immortal’s palm refine the stone chamber.

I often climb the shell-paved towers to pluck tender jade herbs,
At times I break fragrant osmanthus in the Moon Palace.
Brilliant as brocade, it once opened for me—
Permitting me to wander the Five Emperors’ realm.

**A Whistle Toward the Distant Peak**
Pointing afar to the high peak, I let out a whistle—
Red radiance and purple mist arise before my face.
Often in the dusty market, none recognize me,
Yet when I reach the mountains, cranes come to greet me.

With staff I play the jade toad to drive away ghosts and specters,
By night I boil the golden tripod to cook the stars.
When one day I journey to Penglai Grotto,
Know that my immortal household bears a name.

How laughable are the worldly who ask of my home—
My cloud-sleeved staff brushes against mist and rosy clouds.
My brows conceal lightning, no idle boast,
My hands plant golden lotuses, yet I do not boast.

A three-foot scorched paulownia is my living craft,
A pot of spring wine is my livelihood.
Riding a dragon, I roam far to the Three Isles,
Beneath the night moon, none remain to sully its radiance.

By the winding river’s edge, I sit and gaze outward,
A single long path ascends to heaven’s end.
Auspicious clouds bear the Red Child in their embrace,
Auspicious vapors linger where white mists arise.

Lead and mercury now become the supreme medicine,
Kan and Li today fuse to form the elixir.
Its power can save lives, banishing age and decay—
It lies in the human heart, not in difficulty.

Cultivate, cultivate, cultivate until you reach Qian’s perfection,
Then you may be called the world’s drunken immortal.
In the world, time hurries short-lived scenes,
Within the grotto, flowers and trees enjoy eternal years.

My form soars the sheer cliffs, knowing dragon bones,
My spirit dwells in the Mysterious Palace, another heaven apart.
I only wish the master would glance my way often,
No need to seek mysteries beyond the mystery.

The mystery of the Mystic Gate, the principle of the mystery—again mysterious,
The root of deathlessness lies in mercury and lead.
Know this as the true and sole defense,
Harmonizing the Six-and-One, it too aligns with heaven.

Beneath Jade Capital Mountain, lambs frolic,
By Golden Water River, stone tigers slumber.
The subtlest art can generate the true original body,
Diligence in every place brings effortless mastery.

Though nobles and ministers are honored, I do not respond,
Mentioning the immortal’s life, I depart to wander.
For holding a liver of stone, I met the mirage sea,
In seeking sweet snow, I reached Yingzhou.

After mountains and rivers grow drunk, they are stored within the gourd,
When gods and ghosts grow idle, they are gathered into the casket.
Seeing none here recognize me,
I would rather blend with the mortal stream over cups of wine.

Once I paid homage to the Primordial One to visit the immortals,
Freely ascending Kunlun to sip the moon’s essence.
Jade maidens gathered the verdant beauty of pines,
Mountain lads carried white jade tablets.

From time to time, I poured the thousand-year wine of the sea,
Accustomed to plucking the four-season flowers within the gourd.
Now in the mortal realm, none recognize me,
Soon I shall wave my sleeves and enter mist and rosy clouds.

Fire sown in the cinnabar field, gold naturally grows,
Layer upon layer of pavilions, so distinct.
Three thousand merits in a hundred days,
A journey of ten thousand miles to Penglai in a single day.

My form transforms in the netherworld, no ghostly register holds me,
In the Jade Capital, my immortal name endures.
This morning I attend the Jasper Pool assembly,
Nine-tiered banners and streamers welcome me within the grotto.

Gazing upon Master Cui’s *Mirror of Ingested Medicine*,
My heart’s ground grows ever clearer.
The yang dragon speaks, emerging from the Li Palace,
The yin tiger returns, born upon the Kan trigram.

When these two meet, they form the root of the Dao,
Traversing the five directions, they attain the elixir’s name.
If cultivators of truth know this,
They shall surely ride the red dragon back to Jade Capital.

Floating life is insubstantial, treated with neglect,
Ingesting and concealing, the body holds wondrous bones.
Having understood right and wrong, I question worldly folk—
How can they transcend things to commune with nothingness?

Speaking with mortals, my feelings grow dull,
Walking alone, I lightly brush past.
A single speck of powder divides into five hues,
Flying elixir enters the grotto of immortals.

Do not wonder that I love to chant celestial poems,
For I have rarely heard such in the mortal world.
Accustomed to dining on the Queen Mother’s grotto rice,
I once wore the Penglai grotto’s robes.

My steed treads the sun’s wheel, red mist unfurls,
The phoenix bears the moon’s horn, azure clouds take flight.
When shall I again rein the green-silk bridle,
And brandish my golden whip to enter the Purple Tenuity?

Yellow sprout and white snow, both transmute into gold,
Walking, I sing loudly; drunk, I chant.
Sun and moon secretly support your chronicles,
Heaven and earth naturally befriend me.

Spirits vanish at the trace of the Three Clarities’ sword,
Wind and rain soar as I play my zither.
Where shall I return after my southern journey?
Do not let the crane depart to seek me in heaven.

Spring arrives, I wander to the immortal’s home,
Where doors display extraordinary February blossoms.
The cyclical stems reveal your life’s work,
The cyclical branches fulfill your destiny—no need for boasting.

Each possesses a pure, numinous nature beyond heaven,
How could one forget the turbid and cast aside arrogance?
If you grasp the thousand-day effort,
You shall return after ten thousand years into mist and rosy clouds.

Cloud-like tresses gleam, my bones grow lighter,
I say I seek the crane to reach Penglai and Yingzhou.
Discussing herbs and music all day, I know their savor,
Asking of immortals, I learn all their names.

On clear nights, the azure dragon pierces the emerald grotto,
In cold repose, I lie high in the White Silver City.
Come spring, I shall again take up my staff to depart,
Recalling Xuanyuan’s journey upon the sea.

Dragon essence and tortoise eyes harmonize,
The sixteen-foot lad cannot endure.
Nine cups of water simmer the Red Child,
A single wheel of fire nurtures the yellow sprout.

The moon, full, naturally dissolves the heavenly net,
Only when merits are complete does one know how to escape the earthly snare.
Half-drunk, I happily swallow phoenix marrow,
I urge you, no longer mistake the fleeting for the eternal.

Forcing myself to dwell in this scene, bereft of kindred spirits,
Though wild scenes abound, they do not suit my chant.
If my verses clamor in the ears of ministers,
My name shall stir the hearts of emperors.

The Dao has no sash, I sleep alone,
Flowered bamboo hat and bark crown, I am too lazy to don.
Beyond this, I have no other affairs—
A pot of rustic wine, a zither.

Within Huayang Mountain lie many fields of mushrooms,
The old man of Huayang Mountain further extends his years.
Beneath the towering boughs by the verdant pine mounds,
I drink the flying spring amid white clouds.

Neither cold nor hot, my spirit sways,
Coming from the west, departing to the east, my qi flows gently.
When three thousand merits are complete, it is time to return,
Do not speak of the grotto-heaven to worldly folk.

Heaven-born, the natural heart does not scatter,
Success and failure have ever been thus, from ancient times to now.
Those who find the path know all shall transcend the world,
The deluded forever sink in vain.

The supreme joy at one’s side demands refinement,
Beyond things, the cinnabar sand must be carefully sought.
The immortal’s realm lies within the grotto chamber, a hand’s span away,
Do not follow the waves and squander your radiance.

I have hidden in the Mysterious Capital, forgetting spring,
How many times has the azure sea turned to dust?
Within the Jade Capital’s hall, I paid homage to the Primordial One,
In the Golden Gate Palace, I bowed to the Old Lord.

When bored, I ride the thousand-year crane,
When at leisure, I soar beyond the nine heavens’ clouds.
Now I have learned the art of longevity,
Yet I am not willing to pass it on to the world.

Gazing within the palms of the Northern Emperor and Southern Star,
I secretly penetrate creation’s mysteries.

Within golden sleeves resides the Primordial Abode,
Jade gates and starry palaces descend from the Supreme Mystery.
The world entire seeks this Dao—
Yet who, in vain, grasps the Mysterious Pass?

Brightly the Dao abides, awaiting its reckoning;
By the shoals of sun and moon, it departs and returns.
Within the radiance of daylight, it merges with nature,
As thunder races and lightning strikes the Central Plain.

Ever riding the crimson steed, dwelling in the Eastern Hall,
Grandly unsealed the vermilion gates, floating upon azure springs.
Fiercely drawing the Kunwu blade to sing of sagely transformation,
Joyfully accompanying the solitary moon to celebrate the new year.

Only then is it known as the immortals’ treasure,
Bestowed solely upon the virtuous for transmission.
Six dragons in unison hail ascension to Qian,
Their horns subtly wielding the power of creation.

The true Dao often hums beneath the pale autumn moon,
The profound word ever flows through the chill jade waves.
By day, riding the white stag through Peng Isle,
By night, crowned in gold, standing atop the ancient altar.

A single year yields the elixir of a thousand ages—
Who would sully their sleeves with the dust of the mortal realm?
Upon the shoals of the Five Peaks, the scene renews,
The virtuous one alone attains the formless body.

Heavenly songs convey the Dao as the Three Origins settle,
Earth’s veins pulse, bringing forth the myriad beings.
Awaken to the Valley Spirit and cultivate this Way,
Cease discourse on principle and seek the real.

Brightly expounded along the path of the Central Yellow,
Amidst the thunder’s roar, one attains the divine.
Longing to join the immortal maidens, the body grows light,
Soaring past Penglai to reach the Highest Clarity.

Crimson-crested cranes arrive from beyond the clouds,
Purple-scaled fish welcome from the sea’s depths.
Chang’e’s tender osmanthus blooms first,
The Queen Mother’s immortal peaches gradually ripen.

Gazing down, the sun’s chariot hastens toward dawn—
Surely the mortal world has long attained longevity.
The four seas bustle, yet one remains at leisure,
Each mouth speaks of worldly dust.

Knowing you possess the Dao, I come to this mountain—
How could nameless obscurity compare to dwelling in the world?
Twelve towers and terraces conceal secret formulas,
Within five thousand words lies hidden the Mysterious Pass.

Only then is it known that the crucible stores the elixir of stars,
Begging but a single *daogui* grain to behold.
Severing the bonds of splendor, casting aside glory,
From the first attainment, one is everlasting.

Once by the brocade waters, a cicada’s molt was left behind,
Again at Penglai, a name was shed.
Thrice journeying, untouched by fortune or misfortune,
A speck of dust lingers in the world’s affections.

Unknowing where the fulfilled merit leads,
One rides the azure dragon straight to Jade Capital.
In those years, poetry’s worth filled the imperial capital,
Yet with a careless wave of the arm, the true man departed west.

Alone, he possessed ten thousand acres of white clouds,
Who else might claim a branch of the immortal osmanthus?
Casually, the fisherman of Wei’s bend beckoned,
Drunk, he ascended Lotus Peak, supported by a Daoist.

One day, we shall meet again,
By the bamboo stream and thatched hut, calling through the night.

The golden hammer gleams, dancing upon the celestial steps,
Alone, he rides the dragon, departing and returning.
High he reclines in the white clouds, observing the sun’s cavern,
Leisurely he slumbers beneath the autumn moon, cleaving the heavens.

The *li* flower, petal by petal, is born of heaven and earth,
The *kan* medicine, fluttering, is shaped by creation.
Evening drunk among the nine peaks, turning to gaze—
Beneath the northern dark mountain, bones lie pale.

Friendship is ever deep with those of the Dao,
As sun and moon follow them, rising and setting.
To suffer longing for the crane beyond the clouds,
One must forge the gold within the water with resolve.

When the elixir is complete, the cosmos may seem too narrow,
Yet once ingested, what fear of illness or harm?
Not yet departed to the Jasper Terrace, still mingling in the world,
No harm in a cup of wine, delighting in idle verse.

By chance, embracing lute and sword, descending through misty vines—
What fortune to pass through this day!
Comparisons are all alike, yet seem fitting,
But acupuncture and medicine yield little effect.

The immortal classics have been read—three thousand scrolls,
Ancient methods once held—twelve disciplines.
If these minor immortal recipes are doubted,
Step forth on the golden steps and see for yourself.

Overturning Huayang in drunken revelry again and again,
Riding the dragon at dusk, descending to the southern ramparts.
Brows furrowed, striking the sword like streaking meteors,
Robes, from sleeping amid clouds, cling to emerald mist.

The golden liquid transforms into rain and dew,
Returning to the Jade Capital, the aged pines and cedars.
Once, an iron mirror was used to illuminate spirits and ghosts,
Thunder rumbled, searching as water filled the pool.

The iron mirror smelted gold as fire filled the sky,
Beyond the azure pool, dragons danced in the evening sun.
The qilin’s intent harmonized with heaven and earth,
The mechanism of dew and mist lay in the sun and moon’s east.

A three-foot sword lay across the twin rivers’ banks,
A five-spiked crown atop the hundred spirits’ palace.
Leisurely spreading kingfisher plumes to bind the spirit’s cave,
Donning golden lotuses to enact creation’s work.

Following karmic deeds, drifting and sinking,
Like water or cloud, a single heart.
Two scrolls of Daoist scriptures, a three-foot sword,
A flowering staff, a seven-stringed zither.

Within the gourd, medicine awaits to be given to others,
In the belly, new poems meet travelers to be recited.
A single bite of mercury adds a thousand years of life,
A single pill of elixir transmutes a catty of gold.

Half-drunk before the forked path, how many autumns have passed?
Riding dragons and phoenixes, forever without care.
Kings, ministers, and chancellors are not loved—
Only the *kan* and *li* are the wondrous tally.

Alone seated on Penglai, observing the cosmos,
Drawing the sword from the brow, roaming the seas.
Witnessing injustice stirring within the heart,
Resolving grievances, avenging shame, taking heads.

Lute, sword, wine, and chess—dragon, crane, and tiger,
Carefree and untroubled, forever without worry.
Leisurely riding the white stag through the three isles,
At times driving the green ox across the ten continents.

From afar in the azure grotto, the bright moon rests in the palm,
High in the green mountains, concealed beside the clouds.
If mortals wish to be thus,
Let fame and profit’s floating splendor be cast aside at once.

Within the Purple Tenuity Palace, I know myself,
Sharpening the spirit-sword until it flies of its own accord.
First dispatching jade lads to open the southern hall,
Then sending the green dragon into the northern darkness.

Nine crucibles harbor the Yellow Sprout, where the sleeping phoenix roosts,
A single immortal’s frame nurtures the numinous fungus.
Peng Isle is no place for mortals to dwell—
Only fear the foolish may leak the world’s secrets.

Turning the body, one at last emerges from the dust,
The work of creation lies solely in man.
Early, the exalted dragon casts off the earth’s net,
How could the White Tiger emerge from the celestial truth?

Endless the path—who would detain me?
Silent, wordless, naturally merging with the divine.
Striking the sword by night, where does one return?
Clad in stars and moonlight, slaying the qilin.

Watching idly as blossoms fall,
Each sword dance met with a sigh.
Ever anxious that the white sun’s light hastens time,
Ever resentful that the azure heavens’ road is distant.

The original intent sought neither fame nor profit,
The primordial heart only admired water and mist.
The world’s myriad affairs drift and sink—
Who understands principle as does my family?

Ten thousand matters in the world drift and settle,
Who attains reason like my household?

The sun unfolds its explanations, the moon sighs its cinnabar,
The lords of Hua-Xia behold with mortal eyes.
Benevolence and righteousness differ as Hu and Yue differ,
Worldly sentiments are as hard to fathom as Mount Tai and Mount Heng.

The Eight Immortals refine and forge to final creation,
The Four Seas grind and polish, their gaze cold and piercing.
What is level yet not level—ten thousand times ten thousand,
Striking the sword, riding the dragon to the Ninth Heaven.

Since parting, the rising waters drown the east wind,
Drunken eyes, lingering emotions—weary or not?
The golden sword roars, shaking heaven and earth,
The jade crucible seals the boiling of sun and moon.

Staff in hand, three thousand *li* to the lands of Chu,
Crane’s wings span ten thousand layers over Qin’s rivers.
To report to the immortal of Jin City:
We shall meet again in spring’s hues at Lotus Peak.

Shaven head, blood dripping, eyes like forge-fire,
Breath exhaled, clouds rise—rage at the world’s questions.
Intolerable, the thousand injustices of this age,
Must seek a single decisive strike to sweep away the fierce and stubborn.

Where the flood-dragon is slain, the seas churn,
When the raging tiger is felled, distant mountains are uprooted.
To extinguish the heartless and betrayers of virtue,
The sword’s light, star-stained, leaves its marks.

Rain and snow fall thickly, the sky already dusk,
Golden goblets filled, soothing the scorched paulownia.
Poems chanted at the feast, not a moment passed,
The sword dances before the banquet, swift as the wind.

Why does one’s conduct ever linger past midnight?
Suddenly, eyes blazing, one leaps into the void.
Who knows who lacks loyalty and filial piety?
A head is seized and brought to the seat.

Three feet of frost and wind—ghosts and spirits grieve,
With wide sleeves and tall cap, one attains freedom.
Overjoyed, one boasts and sings the songs of Yue,
Enraged, the brows arch, drawing the sword of the heavens.

Since leaving the three isles of the azure sea,
One no longer visits the vermilion gates of the five marquises.
Half-drunk, one rolls up sleeves and stands defiant,
Asking who harbors grievances so grave.

Before refining the elixir, refine the heart,
Only when the cinnabar is complete does one grasp the source of the Dao.
Often, guests are kept with money to buy wine,
Who believes one lacks the medicine to transmute gold?

Within the cave, wind and thunder are grasped in the palm,
In the gourd, sun and moon rest in the breast.
The work of immortals is hard for men to comprehend,
Cultivating nature, attaining long life—one hums to oneself.

The iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden coins,
The stone boy strings them through.
A single grain of millet holds a world,
Half a *sheng* of the cauldron boils mountains and rivers.

The white-bearded elder’s brows touch the ground,
The blue-eyed barbarian points to the sky.
If you can fathom this mystery,
Beyond this mystery, there is no further mystery.

The *Ji* star and *Xu* constellation descend from the long sky,
How can the common scene not be marveled at?
The dragon emerges from the water, its scales complete,
The crane soars to the heavens, its feathers whole.

Teaching transformation amidst the dust, a thousand eyes watch,
Yet in the world, few understand the *Erya*.
It is only that the common folk’s fortune and fate are meager,
They cannot bear to lightly transmit the subtle and wondrous.

At leisure, one swings an arm and enters the Gate of Heaven,
Sweeping the sleeves, slowly gathering the colored clouds.
Silent, one gazes down at the Yellow Valley’s child,
Smiling, one bows to the Purple Mist Lord.

Planning to linger by the Jade Palace, leaning on gold,
Returning to visit Yingzhou, watching the sun’s decline.
Just as the Moon Goddess holds her feast,
The nectar newly brewed, its fragrance wafting.

Once followed Liu and Ruan, drunk in Peach Blossom Spring,
Yet to wake in the mortal world, still owing wine money.
A hempen robe serves for now,
When the sun returns from the Ninth Heaven, it shall be repaid.

Phoenix-feathered robes are not prized,
Even the white fox’s fur cannot compare.
This alone is the world’s priceless treasure—
If not, try burning it in fire to see.

Reflecting on past events, one grows bold,
Having read the *Thousand Character Classic*, the thirteenth chapter.
When Empress Wu died, she was a maiden,
When King Chen perished, he was a boy.

Two chariots of sun and moon, let them bear the load,
Nine rivers’ guesses hang from a single eave’s pole.
All day, no one speaks of news,
A pot of spring wine, one drinks to intoxication.

Sleeves hanging, one soars beyond the world’s dust,
A gourd carried, one roams several times.
Fame and profit, outside the body, are not the Dao,
At the Dragon-Tiger Gate, discern the true.

Unwittingly, the dream-soul journeys to the Purple Palace,
For years, one’s traces have hidden in the dust of the world.
If we meet again in Huayin’s market,
It will not be as an ordinary medicine-seller.

Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures, a three-foot zither,
Liu An, hearing of this, is a kindred spirit.
A staff’s tip holds spring’s hues, a pot of wine,
In the crucible, cinnabar—not transmuted gold.

Several times, drunk and sleeping at the mountain’s mouth,
At leisure, one fishes the heart of Dongting.
How many times have we met and encountered?
Only fear that, soaring to the heavens, there will be no place to seek.

Once battled Chi You before the Jade Palace,
Six dragons high, the jade chimes resounding.
Behind the south-pointing chariot, the golden drums followed,
Beside the black turtle banner, the iron-crowned marched.

Drunk, clutching the black beard, the three isles darkened,
Enraged, drawing the frost-edged sword, the ten continents chilled.
After the age of the Yellow Emperor’s reign,
One has long sought the deep and stern, yet found it hard.

Hair wild as waves, voice like a bell,
Face like ice and snow, bones like pine.
In the scabbard, the treasured sword roars ceaselessly,
In the sleeve, the golden hammer displays martial prowess.

When drinking, one is a companion and singer,
When chanting poems, one delves into the *Cantong Qi*.
In recent years, one is bound for the Kunlun feast,
Riding a fierce, nine-colored dragon.

The gates of immortals open to the Yellow Palace,
The gates of generals and ministers to the White Jade Capital.
If even the caves lack fine scenes,
What remains in the world but the multitudes?

Carrying the zither, one strolls idly, following the crane,
In the scabbard, the sword gleams with rosy clouds, awaiting the slaying of the whale.
Advancing or retreating, neither is lost,
I leave it to you to point the way forward.

Worldly sentiments, like yin rain, seem to isolate,
Lightning flashes, thunder shakes the eight directions.
Long gone, the chaotic mountains add mist and dew,
Not coming to the level earth to save the withered and emaciated.

The spring’s hues of Yuan and Rong linger in the echoes,
The autumn winds of construction harm the traveler’s path.
Playing with the three questions, the thatched hut is broken,
At the moment, how many years will one see?

**Seven-character quatrains**

Autumn’s scene desolate, leaves scatter in flight,
Beneath the courtyard pine’s shadow, time passes as one sits.
Clouds obscure the crane’s chariot—where has it gone?
The immortal’s cave at dawn misses my appointed time.

Seizing the golden essence to make the foundation of life,
At the sun’s eastern edge, the moon’s western glow.
Within it, refine the elixir of long life,
Consuming it, one becomes equal to heaven and earth.

Morning chases floating fame, evening discards it,
Within the cave, the sun and moon—I am the sky.
In the scabbard, the treasured sword roars ceaselessly,
Not meeting a man of resolve, it vows not to be transmitted.

The sword rises, stars flee, executing ten thousand *li*,
Wind and thunder follow, the sound of rain prevails.

**The man’s head rolls yet his words remain,**
Striding high, chanting past the Five Lakes.
"Master! Master!"—his visage fierce and grim,
He draws his sword to strike where clouds err.
Three sharp shouts ring out in rapid succession,
With a *clang*, the man falls empty into the void.

"Master! Master! Do not tarry,
The Dao must be passed, the sword held in reverence.
Today we meet by the sea’s edge,
Let us hasten to the village wine and roam as one."

His brows bristle, fierce spirit surging,
A single bound—ten thousand *li* through the sky.
The three-foot sword in the scabbard on his back,
Heaven’s blade to slay the unjust.
Sharpening the green-wind three-foot sword,
The golden hammer in his sleeve, never wielded in vain.
If one is a man of resolve, he must be repaid,
How could he let others say he is no true man?

With bushy brows and towering resolve, his voice like thunder,
Hearing of grievances, he sets down his cup.
Sword in hand, he soars a thousand *li* through the sky,
Parting at the first watch, returning by the second.
This morning, rising in the pitch-black dark,
A thousand *li* to avenge, all in an instant.
From his sleeve, he pours out a dead man’s head,
His mouth still muttering, *"De, de."*

By South Mountain’s edge, we meet again,
Grasping hands, earnest words ring like bells.
"Since you mastered the sword after we parted,
Where there are dragons, you slay dragons."
Half a day’s journey spans the world,
No need to ride phoenix or mount dragon.
By chance, in a game of skill, his divine sword flew,
Shattering the first peak of Zhongnan.
Morning roams Nanyue, evening Cangwu,
His sleeve holds a green serpent, his gall bold.
Thrice entering Yueyang, none recognize him,
Chanting aloud as he flies past Dongting Lake.

To study the Dao, one must be utterly poor,
A few coins only in his purse.
If one asks of my method of cultivation,
I point afar to the sun and moon on the horizon.
Unbetraying the Three Lights, unbetraying men,
Neither deceiving the divine nor the destitute.
If one asks of my method of cultivation,
Only tend the field of the heart to nurture this body.
Three *mu* of cinnabar field, no seeds to sow,
When planting, one must have the Red Dragon plow.
I once taught others to sow this child,
But without understanding cultivation, the Dao does not grow.

No need for matchmakers to seek without,
The Returned Elixir is gathered within the body.
Do not say the Great Dao is hard to attain,
It is only that one’s effort has not reached its peak.
Drink wine—let it be a hundred cups,
Eastward bound, floating like a matchmaker’s ladder.
If the essence of the sun unites with the moon’s glow,
A bright pearl will rise.
Flickering, tiger and dragon, divine beings take flight,
Rely on this body’s work—do not go astray.
When transmitting, it must be with the power of heaven and earth,
Then penetrate the Three Clarities, pass through the Purple Tenuity.

In the depths of the Primal Sea, life’s pivot lies hidden,
Within dwells the Yellow Lad, the Jade Emperor’s Lord.
The White Snow Divine Talisman conceals the Maiden of Nü,
The Spirit’s Origin is guarded by the Ten Lords of Yuan.
Do not wonder why news from Jasper Pool is rare,
Only because worldly affairs veil heaven’s mechanism.
If one finds fire within water,
A Jade Lad ascends to the Great Subtlety.

Clapping hands, dancing with gourd,
Crossing ridges, piercing clouds, his staff flies.
Coming and going eight thousand *li* in half a day,
By the southern bank of Jinzhou, a pine gate stands.
Tipping the gourd, casting aside the zither,
He strides straight up Ox-Crouching Peak.
Water flies on stone, bursting like snow,
Standing to gaze at heaven, sitting to chant.

The flask like gold, the jade child yellow,
Ascending and descending, replenishing divine sustenance.
The Three Origins unite in a year of stillness,
In this heaven, the sun and moon endure long.
The Elbow-Transmitted Cinnabar Script—a thousand-year art,
Reciting the *Yellow Court* in two scrolls.
In the crane’s abode, the ancient altar within the locust’s shade,
No human trace, the door ever ajar.

My home originally dwells in Heaven’s Pivot,
Scattered white clouds lock the stone steps.
Penglai’s eastern sea lies beyond ten thousand *li*,
Yet I return as before, the path unerring.
The Lotus Peak Daoist, lofty and pure,
Never descends from Lotus Peak through the years.
At night, he bows to the stars, his jade hairpin cold,
At dawn, dragon and tiger open the golden tripod, seething.

I myself forget the spirit, my heart delights,
Striding over water, piercing clouds to visit.
I do not ask of the Yellow Sprout or the Elbow’s Prescription,
How can the wondrous Dao’s subtlety be spoken?
If men of this age wish to go to Yingzhou,
First pass the towering Twelve Towers.
There, thunder and lightning roar,
A pool of golden water flows eastward.

Alone on the high mountain, gazing at the Eight Capitals,
After the black clouds scatter, the moon remains solitary.
In the boundless cosmos, men numberless,
How few true men are men of resolve?

The fire-wheel, small, emerges from the divine continent,
Straining to bear it with an iron ox.
With a red heart, bearing it to Kunlun’s summit,
Who knows the Returned Elixir is called the Purple Journey?

Nurture the spirit-root with essence, the spirit with *qi*,
Beyond this truth, there is no other truth.
The immortals are unwilling to speak plainly,
Thus misleading thousands upon thousands of men.

**Five-character regulated verse**

The twenty-four gods are pure,
Three thousand merits and deeds complete.
Cold clouds connect to the earth’s axis,
The sacred sun fills the sky with light.
The Prince’s Son is most fit to plant,
How could the golden field be tilled?
Within this, the true wondrous principle—
Who says one cannot attain long life?

The Dao is penetrated, the Mysterious again penetrated,
Its name left to spread across the four seas.
Friends rely on a single staff,
Livelihood—two empty fists.
Seeking fruit, hesitating to plant,
Thinking of wine, instantly coining sacred money.
Who knows that coming to blend with the world,
Is not again to turn away from heaven?

Wondrous, wondrous within the wondrous,
Mysterious within the mysterious, even more mysterious.
In movement and speech, all expound the Dao,
In silence, all become immortals.
In the palm, like a pearl, strange,
In the sky, the moon gleams bright.
When one’s merit is complete in time,
Straight to the Great Luo Heaven ascend.
