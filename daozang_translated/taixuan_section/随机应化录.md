**Preface to the *Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances* by the Pure One**
There was a **Quanzhen Daoist** of the Shaanxi region, whose ancestral home was in **Zhejiang’s Simin** (Four Mings). His father resided in **Qiantang**, where **Master He Daoquan** was born. From his youth, the Master cultivated the Dao, taking the name **Wugouzi** (the Unstained One), and wandered the lands by the **East Sea**. Few took note of him at the time. Later, he journeyed westward to **Zhongnan Mountain**, dwelling in the ruins of **Guifeng Peak**, where his cultivation reached fulfillment. The people marveled at this, and it is recorded in inscriptions.

In the **Mengcheng** month of the **Jisi year of Hongwu** (1379), the Master passed away in a **Long’an medical hall**. Noble officials bestowed upon him the rites of **ascension**, and he was interred in the **graveyard of the Immortals**.

Two years later, **Sun Shoutongzi** (Master Sun, the Longevity Communicator) arrived, speaking thus: *"I had long known Master He, but now he has departed—there is no longer any hope of seeing him again."* Alas, how lofty was Master He’s spirit! He bowed respectfully and entreated me, *"I beg you to compose a preface for this work."*

I sighed and replied: *"The Dao cannot be made manifest through mere description; one must record its true practice. Though my learning is meager, I shall strive to express it in words."* Indeed, in both past and present, those who aspire to the Dao often fail to grasp its ultimate essence. Yet Master He penetrated the principles of **nature and fate**, embodying the teaching of **non-action**, so that even common folk revered his transformation. How could this be, unless his innate purity was profound?

**Jia Daoxuan** was Master He’s disciple. Carrying medicine, he traveled a thousand miles without fatigue, determined to complete this record. Without Master Sun’s request, I would not have undertaken this work. Yet Master Sun’s Dao is now manifest, and Master He’s Dao is also manifest—like matching seals. Since Master He’s passing, without Master Sun, the **orthodox teaching** would have no one to transmit it. Though Master Sun was younger, he revered Master He, and now, after his departure, he further illuminates his legacy. This alone reveals Master He’s **virtue**.

Their bond was profound. The compilation of this **language record** was Master He’s own work, completed before his death, and it holds great significance for the teaching. This was written on the **sixth day of the sixth month, Xinyi year of Hongwu** (1381), by **Kunqiu Lingtongzi** (the Responsive Sage of Kunqiu).

**Volume One of the *Record of Spontaneous Transformation in Accordance with Circumstances***
Narrated by **Master He Daoquan, the Pure One of Songxi**
Compiled by his disciple **Jia Daoxuan**.

**The Way Manifests**

Master [He Daoquan] journeyed away from Zhe, wandering through Huai and Chu, arriving at the True Martial Hall by the Red Lotus Lake in Muyang. There, he encountered an old Daoist friend reclining in high spirits, who exclaimed, *"The Pure One of Songxi has come to visit—let us mix the clay with the disciples!"*

The old friend, Gao, laughed, *"These past few years, the Pure One has been dragging himself through mud and water."*

Master replied, *"He knows only that lotus roots grow in the mud, but does not see that lotus flowers bloom when they rise above the water."*

Gao asked, *"What relation does the lotus root bear to the lotus flower? How can their forms be compared?"*

Master answered, *"The lotus root symbolizes the human body. The lotus flower represents the true nature of the heart. A Daoist and a common person may respond to affairs in the same way, but it is in the mind’s essence that they differ. Thus, I composed a verse:*

*'The void itself sets no dust in motion,
Outer forms are false, yet the core is true.
Only the lotus root knows how to thrive in stagnant mud,
Never has it seen the lotus flower’s fresh emergence from the water.'*

Master then traveled westward, crossing the Yellow River, and reached the humble hermitage of Master Zhan. While conversing with an aged monk, a novice arrived to listen to the teachings.

The aged monk said, *"There is no law to expound."*

Master replied, *"This is the true expounding of the Way! Have you not heard the *Diamond Sutra* say: ‘Without law to expound, this is called expounding the law’?"*

The Confucian scholar remarked, *"Though the Way transcends the senses of hearing and sight, one cannot truly escape their use."*

Long ago, when **Subhuti** reclined in meditation among the cliffs, the heavenly hosts showered him with flowers, saying, *"We see the Honorable One skillfully expounding Prajna [Wisdom]."*

The Honorable One replied, *"I have never uttered a single word about Prajna."*

The heavenly hosts said, *"If the Honorable One does not speak, then we have not heard either. Without speech and without hearing, this is the true Prajna."*

The *Thunder Ancestor Sutra* states: *"If you wish to hear the supreme Way, the supreme Way is profound and distant—it lies not in other things. Since you desire to hear it, then ‘without hearing’ is the Way itself."*

Those who study the Way must be sincere and gentle, keeping silent and guarding themselves, only then can they enter the Way.

The novice further inquired about the meaning of *‘middle.’*

Master said, *"Wherever thoughts arise, that is the middle—this is the Daoist understanding of ‘middle.’"*

The Buddhist [monk] explained, *"Neither clinging to good nor to evil—when the mind is just and clear, that is your original face, this is the Buddhist understanding of ‘middle.’"*

The Confucian scholar said, *"The state before the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight manifest is called ‘middle’—this is the Confucian understanding of ‘middle.’ You should ponder this."*

Master arrived at the Ning An hermitage in **Pingning**, where **Zhang An** was the primary attendant seeking his guidance.

The novice asked, *"Between the peach pit and the peach tree, which came first?"*

Master replied, *"You only see gardens with flowers blooming in full array,
yet do not know all owe their growth to the **yang and** force of **the sun’s qi (阳和力)**.
It is but a single **true qi (一炁分真)**,
transformed and manifesting as such."*

At the **beginning of the Great Ultimate (太极初判)**,
the formless can generate the myriad forms,
the shapeless can govern the shaped—
this is what is called the **Emperor of Forms (象帝)** before their appearance.

The hermitage attendant further asked, *"Between the chicken egg and the hen, which came first?"*

Master said, *"These are all of one principle (一理)."*

The attendant asked, *"Yet some eggs do not hatch into birds—why is that?"*

Master replied, *"Consider the peach pit,
hanging in empty space without rooting in earth—
how could it sprout and grow into a tree?"*

The *Sutra of the Beginning of Writing (文始经)* states:
*"All seeds within the soil,
by the transformative power of heaven and earth, sprout into life.
The sprouts grow into trees,
the trees then blossom with flowers,
the flowers wither into fruit,
the fruit ripens into seeds,
the seeds return to sprouts,
the sprouts return to trees—
seeds and sprouts mutually generating,
their changes extending countless billions of trees,
endless without end.*

*If a seed hangs suspended in the void,
untouched by any boundary or side,
not dwelling within the earth,
though heaven and earth be vast,
they cannot transform the seed in emptiness
to sprout and grow into a tree.*

*Moreover, when yin and yang unite,
the transformative power of heaven and earth produces birds,
the birds then lay eggs,
the eggs and birds mutually generating—
their changes extending countless billions of birds,
endless without end.*

*If an egg lacks the yang (雄),
though yin and yang be wondrous,
they cannot transform it—
this is pure yin without yang.*

*As the ancients said:
Pure yang unmixed becomes a **xian (仙)**,
yin and yang harmonized create all things,
pure yin without yang becomes a **gui (鬼)**.*

*Emperor Yin (尹真君)* declared:
*"Those who have not yet harmed me,
I subdue with a single breath—
then they transform into all things.
Among the Five Phases (五行),
who can resist my transformation?"*

*For those who cultivate the Way,
when encountering phenomena,
they must pass through lightly and swiftly—
all afflictions must not be clung to or suppressed.
If they are bound by myriad things,
and cling to objects, they will be transformed by them,
ensnared by yin and yang,
their thoughts shifting with each circumstance—
thus they fall into the cycle of rebirth and wanderings in samsara.*

*If even a thread of thought arises,
they must immediately subdue it.
If they can extinguish thoughts and forget emotions,
all afflictions will cease,
and yin and yang will no longer forge them.*

*Like a seed suspended in the void,
an egg without yang,
outside the Six Coalescences (六合之内),
returning to the primordial origin—
this is no small matter.*

Master then arrived at the **Youde Temple (佑德观)** in **Nazhou (那州)**,
where **Master Xiuju (秀聚峰)** sought his guidance.

The monk asked about the phrase *"reciting the Buddha (念佛)."*

Master said, *"Why seek so far?
How could you not recognize your own Buddha?"*

*"If you were to invite the Western Buddha to come,
where would you place your own family’s Buddha?"*

*"Have you not heard the Old One of the River say:
If you claim he is the Buddha,
you yourself become a demon (魔)."*

*The Daoists say:
Within your body lies the true **Primordial Origin (真元始)**,
why seek the **Celestial Sovereign (天尊)** outside your mind?"*

*The Confucians say:
My body itself contains a **Great Ultimate (太极)."***

The monk further asked, *"Please, Master, reveal the swift path of reciting the Buddha—
how can one attain the Buddha’s true face?"*

Master laughed and said, *"I tell you:
The ancients said,
‘Recite the Buddha once, respond once—
the original face is made utterly clear.
Without the mind, a staff strikes the peach pit—
it startles even the encased spirit within.’*

*This is breaking open the Buddha’s true face.*

*Moreover, the path of reciting the Buddha has three levels:
First, subduing demons;
second, visualization;
third, inquiry and investigation.*

*None of these three stages depend on counting the beads of recitation.*

*For those who first begin reciting the Buddha,
they must first recite the Buddha to subdue demons.
When the demons are suppressed and thoughts extinguished,
only then do they enter the path.*

*If not so,
they waste their **spirit and qi (神气)**,
and will never succeed.*

*What is crucial is subduing demons and extinguishing thoughts—
when reciting the Buddha,
do not let even a thread of thought arise.
Treat all stray thoughts as the true object,
and strive to replace your dull heart with the Buddha’s heart.*

*If your foundation is shallow,
and you cannot swiftly replace it,
then reflect within yourself:
‘I am one who recites the Buddha—
why do these thoughts arise?
They are the roots of my past karma.’*

*Thus, holding yourself in restraint,
gradually raise the Buddha’s name,
from one to ten voices,
or even to a hundred.
Do not let stray thoughts interrupt—
if thoughts arise, sweep them away;
if no thoughts arise, raise the recitation.*

*The former Master said:
‘Thoughts within no-thoughts,
no-thoughts within thoughts—
this is the way.’*

*With time and practice,
a natural understanding will emerge.
Simply recite the Buddha in all your movements and stillness,
never ceasing.*

*If your thoughts do not stray,
and you never forget the recitation,
until it reaches the point where you do not raise it yet it is raised,
no-thoughts yet thoughts arise—
then you have attained its power.*

*Thus, reciting the Buddha,
you will later bear good fruit.*
*If evil thoughts are many,
and your mouth recites while your heart does not—
this is creating karma,
known as the **‘Buddha’s mouth, serpent’s heart (佛口蛇心).’***

*For those who practice reciting the Buddha through visualization,*
*in all your movements and stillness,
speech and silence,*
*visualize the Buddha at every moment—
this is not done aloud.*

*The Buddha does not leave your heart,
your heart does not leave the Buddha—
like mother and child remembering each other.*

*If even a fleeting thought of phenomena arises,
immediately gather the scene into your heart
and use it as your visualization.*

*Within your own heart is a single true Buddha,
with a purple flame and golden form,
seated in majesty—
towering and unmoving.*

*Never abandon this moment,
visualize and recite at every thought—
whether in thousands or hundreds of recitations,*
*the Buddha appears before you.*

*When facing adverse or favorable circumstances,
or demonic obstacles,*
*sweep them all away with one mind,
visualizing and reciting the Buddha:*
*Amitābha Buddha (阿弥陀佛) is the sovereign master—
like leaning on Mount Sumeru,*
*or clutching a pillar in a rushing torrent,*
*never letting go.*
*The demons will scatter,
the evils will turn right.*

*Even at the time of your hundred-year lifespan’s end,*
*do thus—*
*with one mind, take the Buddha as your master,*
*your thoughts never straying,*
*you will naturally not follow the evil path.*

*If you recite the Buddha while alive,*
*and never forget it for an instant,*
*you will eventually find your way in."*

At once, grasp and press tightly—
realize your own Amitābha,
accomplishing tenfold what a hundred would.

This manner of reciting the Buddha—
one voice surpasses a thousand or hundred.
Guilt vanishes, the Dao grows long—
then your original nature awakens of itself.

For those who delve into reciting the Buddha,
choose a quiet place,
regulate food and drink,
thicken your mat and cushions,
wear loose robes and sit in the lotus posture,
straighten your spine and adjust your *qi*,
banish all stray thoughts,
then gently raise the Buddha’s name.

Not aloud—
silently recite from one to a hundred voices.
If stray thoughts arise, restart from the beginning,
until a hundred voices flow without interruption.

Voice by voice, ponder its meaning:
Who is it that recites the Buddha?
At the dissolution of the four elements,
where does the one who recites the Buddha take refuge—
where does he stand firm and find his home?
Ponder and recite, never letting go.
In all actions—walking, standing, sitting, lying—
practice and recite without forgetting,
exhausting the branches, probing the roots,
seeking absolute clarity.

Until pondering becomes self-pondering,
raising the name becomes self-raising.
With time and depth,
suddenly feeling your own nostrils,
recognizing Amitābha Buddha.

At that moment, one voice
crosses to the other shore—
better than reciting a thousand million billion Buddha names,
better than counting beads until your *qi* is exhausted.

The ancients said:
*"Do not seek the Buddha far off on Spirit Mountain—
Spirit Mountain is within your own heart.
Each person has a Spirit Mountain stupa—
go and cultivate beneath it."*

Thus composed a verse:
*"In the West, a Buddha named Amitābha,
Hidden in the heart, unknown to all.
If you recite without other thoughts,
Hellfire turns to a lotus pool."*

The Master arrived in Pizhou.
A virtuous layman, Su Deshan, sought the Master,
asking about the phrase *"nurturing the heart."*
The Master said:
*"To nurture the heart,
you must remove defilement and still the thoughts.
When thoughts cease, defilement is removed—
the heart becomes naturally pure."*

He asked again about *"nurturing qi."*
The Master said:
*"Sparse speech nurtures *qi*."*

He asked again about *"uniting the head."*
The Master said:
*"Uniting is gathering—
to urge all beings to do good and accumulate merit,
and in that assembly, you are the honored one.
Speaking inwardly,
nurturing spirit and refining *qi*,
harmonizing yin and yang,
balancing the four seasons,
concentrating the five phases,
piercing the three passports to ascend to the Celestial Valley,
gathering the three treasures at the crown,
directing the five *qi* to the Primordial Source,
converging at the *ciliary palace*—
thus it is called *uniting the head*."*

Thus composed a gatha:
*"Do not speak of faults as trivial—
even a drop of water can become an endless river."*

The Master said:
*"Do not say that merit is abundant—
prevent the roadside [merit] from being lost or diminished.
When merit is already great,
still further add virtue—
when evil thoughts are extinguished,
make sure they never arise again.
Only when both virtue and vice are forgotten,
then all things are thoroughly penetrated."*

When the Master arrived at the **Hosting Pass** (*Sùjiāng Xiàn*) **County’s Cave Valley Mountain** (*Dòngyù Shān*), a good friend named **Liu Bótōng** asked about *"movement and stillness"* (*dòngjìng*).
The Master composed a gatha:
*"Stillness is natural ease,
movement brings distinctions.
One thought returns to its origin,
all ties are utterly severed.
Clouds disperse into the azure void,
a single wheel radiant and pure.
Illuminating the original nature,
neither arising nor ceasing.
Just this is true—
do not create convoluted branches.
Lay down, lay down,
resolute yet gradual.
Sudden and direct—
what more can be said?
If you can hold this in reverence,
act upon it without hesitation."*

A monk named **Xīn Chán** came to seek the Master and asked,
*"What is the original nature and face?"*
The Master composed a hymn in response:
*"Formless, shadowless—how can it be sought?
The enlightened see it clearly,
the dim-witted sink into obscurity.
Only when skin and flesh are utterly shed away,
does it shine round and bright—
a single mass of gold."*

The monk gave the Master a fan,
and the Master composed two poems in return:
*"This fan has never endured autumn’s chill,
the golden wind stirs and cannot be held.
I urge you now to let it go,
lest the wild wind toss it in vain and cause distress."*

*"The handle’s strength comes from the palm’s grasp,
releasing and taking—endless ease.
When you can lift it, you must let it go,
then the cool breeze comes—
do not summon the wind."*

The monk also gave the Master a pair of shoes,
and the Master composed a poem in return:
*"Gold needles and jade threads crafted with care,
each step they guide you without fail.
Not a speck of dust or mud clings to them,
pure and clear they lead to the lotus pool."*

When the Master reached the **Yù State** (*Yù Zhōu*) **Immortal Elder’s Hall** (*Xiān Wēng Guàn*), hearing cicadas’ clamor,
he spontaneously composed a poem:
*"The ciliary palace (*ní wán*) turns a hundred times with great effort,
unaware it flips itself out of the filth of former habits.
Discarding the old, foul, encrusted shell,
it alone ascends the highest bough,
green and resplendent."*

While staying at the **Immortal Elder’s Hall** (*Xiān Wēng Guàn*), a **Su** official (*Su Tídìan*) came to seek the Master
and asked about *"pure stillness and Daoist virtue"* (*qīngjìng dàodé*).
The Master said:
*"The soul’s chamber (*líng fǔ*) empty of affairs is *pure stillness*,
a single thought unarisen is *stillness*—
serene and unmoving is the *Dao*,
when touched, it naturally flows—*this is virtue*.
For those beginning their practice,
stillness means guarding the will and lowering the heart,
movement means resting the people and benefiting all things."*

The **Yang** official (*Yáng Tídìan*) asked:
*"The practice of the Dao has four matters:
standing like a pine, walking like the wind,
sleeping like a bow, speaking like a bell.
What does this mean?"*
The Master then composed a poem:

The resolve stands firm as pine enduring winter’s cold,
like wind it moves—no barrier can block its path.
Grasp the spirit’s essence as one strings a bow,
lest a slip undo all effort, lost beyond recall.

Too many words may bring harm or woe,
yet silence too is hard to hold.
From now on, act like bell and drum—
when struck, the sound rings clear; when still, it rests in peace.

If you follow these four matters in the Dao,
what troubles or joys will you still know?
Swiftly tread the path you came—
unaware, the dream of coarse grains fades away.

These four matters divide into inner and outer;
for those just beginning, first the outer, then the inner—
never separate them.

In the season of early summer, the Master, in a moment of inspiration, composed a *Màn Tíng Fāng* poem:

*"The sun and moon like shuttles fly,
time flees swift as arrows—unaware, age steals my face.
Once, I heard the high willows hum with cicadas’ first cries,
today again I meet the summer’s start—
suddenly, another year has passed.
Reflecting, I think: a life is brief—how few moments endure.
The word ‘emptiness’—if you hear it early, awaken quickly,
yet still you linger, delay.
Hurry, cast it all aside, purify the Three Fields.
Refine the yin, nurture the yang—
the clouds of delusion scatter, the radiant sun ascends.
Brilliant light fills all ten directions,
illuminating the unborn before its rise."*

The Master said:
For those just beginning, practice these four methods of nurturing life:
one, strike the teeth often,
two, swallow the saliva often,
three, comb the hair often,
four, refine the breath often.
These are the lesser vehicle’s ways.
Practice them diligently, and you will ward off illness, extend life,
and lighten the body, smooth the skin.

For those cultivating inwardly:
fewer thoughts arise in the heart,
fewer words pass the lips,
less food fills the belly,
less sleep claims the night.

The Holy Mother said:
*"These four reductions—
the Daoist Immortal’s path is complete."*

The Master arrived at the Temple of Guangwu in Sanxiang. A virtuous man, Qin Weijing, came to pay respects and asked: *"What is the 'having within nothing'?"*

The Master replied:
*"Though practitioners possess the Four Great Aggregates*—
their bodies formed by the six elements*—*
within the realm of love and desire,
their minds are free of even the faintest trace of dusty thoughts—
this is the 'having within nothing.'

It is also the 'having-form body without form,'*
a wondrous essence.

The Ancestral Master said:
*'Having form is illusion,
having no form is truth.'*

The man asked again: *"What is 'nothing within having'?"*

The Master replied:
*"Though the mind is without passion,
the heart is without thought,
not clinging to coarse emptiness,
one true nature remains luminous and unobscured—
it must be 'not-empty within emptiness,'
wherefrom the unencumbered arises from the void.
As the ancients said:
*'From emptiness comes white snow,
from stillness emerges the yellow sprout.'*

The man asked further about the two words, *dynamic* and *static*.

The Master replied:
*"The dynamic is the mind,
the static is the nature—*
when the mind stirs, nature vanishes;
when the mind ceases, nature manifests."*

The Daoist said: *"How is nature extinguished?"*

The Master replied:
*"When the guest grows strong and the host weak,
the original truth is obscured."*

The Daoist said: *"How is the mind extinguished?"*

The Master replied:
*"When the host stands upright and the guest flees,
thoughts vanish and emotions are forgotten."*

The Master arrived in Fuchang County, where a man sat in meditation. The Master approached and asked: *"When will the gentleman leave the garden?"*

The man answered: *"When the garden is overturned, I shall depart."*

The Master said: *"If the garden is overturned,
where will one find a place to rest?"*

The gentleman replied: *"The overturned garden is but a metaphor."*

The Master said: *"Why wait for decay
before knowing emptiness?"*

Indeed, those who sit in meditation are not frivolous—
it is the arena for testing the Immortal’s ascent,
known as the *Three Static Gates*.

Thus the scripture says:
*"Small Static, a hundred days;
Medium Static, two hundred days;
Great Static, three hundred days.*
One must discern right from wrong,
not cling to forms.

As the ancients said:
*'All forms are mere illusion.'*

Within the hundred days,
refine and temper the mind—
no trace of dust or defilement remains.
Regulate food and flavor,
resist the demons of sleep,
adjust the breath to softness,
guard the spirit within,
entering the realm of the *Himless*,
the land of the *Non-existent*.
If one attains clarity like water,
or stillness like ice,
over time, a luminous, empty essence will naturally form—
this can be preserved.

If the essence is nurtured into its utmost treasure,
then the spirit may be adjusted to emerge from its shell,
moving near and far with ease,
coming and going with familiarity—
when one wishes to dwell, it follows circumstances;
when one wishes to depart, it sheds the shell.

Do not within the garden
twist and strain in myriad ways,
taking apparitions as true—
this leads to clinging to spirits and demons.
As the ancients said:
*'The Dao has no ghosts or gods,
it comes alone and goes alone.'*

The Former Master said:
*'Reside in the garden, guard the static,
from stillness arises the yang—*
over time, with refinement,
one attains the core,
and naturally achieves the Way.'*

The Master arrived at Lao Degou’s Hermitage in Lushan, where Master Shen came to inquire about where to begin cultivation. The Master said: *"The starting point requires no hands—
nurture, and it will naturally arise.
When the practice reaches the *Leakless Abode*,
one attains eternal longevity."*

For beginners, the eight methods must not be abandoned:
nurture the *body*,
nurture the *stomach*,
nurture the *heart*,
nurture the *spirit*,
nurture the *qi*,
nurture the *essence*,
nurture the *nature*,
nurture the *wisdom*.

Those who nurture the *body*
must reduce weight and seek lightness;
those who nurture the *stomach*
must regulate food and diminish flavor;
those who nurture the *heart*
must think little and desire less;
those who nurture the *spirit*
must be frugal in affairs and avoid prying;
those who nurture the *qi*
must restrain speech and seal the mouth;
those who nurture the *essence*
must curb lust and listen to few sounds;
those who nurture the *nature*
must settle knowledge and not ponder;
those who nurture the *wisdom*
must be deeply still and silent.

These eight methods must not be forsaken.

Then the Master composed a poem:

The Master said:
*"Practice does not require seeking elsewhere—
the Seven Treasures Forest lies within the mind.
Perceiving the Mystery Pass’s true unity,
then you will see the Heavenly Heart.*

When the Master arrived at An East State,
a Daoist friend, Gao Ming, came from afar to visit the Master and asked:
‘What is the meaning of *returning light* and *reverting illumination*?’

The Master replied:
‘*Returning light* is when a single thought returns to its origin.
*Reverting illumination* is when one realizes the past has already passed.
Do not let *returning light* wander outward—
examine *reverting illumination* within yourself.
The Confucianists speak of *earlier enlightenment* and *later enlightenment*.
The Daoists say *self-enlightenment* surpasses enlightening others.
*Self-enlightenment* means no mistakes occur,
while enlightening others leads to confusion of the true nature.
One must constantly examine and reflect,
restraining thoughts and calming the mind,
until no thought remains to be restrained,
no awareness remains to be examined—
when all worldly dust does not cling,
then one is truly a Daoist.

The ancients said:
*Amid a thousand flowers, I pass—
no petal touches my body.*
This is it.

Again, the friend asked:
‘How can one remain unmixed yet untouched by all dust?’

The Master replied:
‘Water moves itself while mountains stand still,
the sky remains at ease while clouds are ever-busy.
If you follow the world’s chaotic affairs,
I remain as I am—
the mind must rule supreme,
not swayed by things,
not deceived by circumstances.
How else can one fully attain one’s true *Suchness*?’

When the Master arrived at the Great Yi Mountain’s ancient Buddha Erta Temple,
he conversed with Master Liang. Then, Iron Ox Master came to visit the Master,
bowing and asking for guidance on the *path of life and death*
and instruction on *the place of origin*.
The Master said:
‘Success and failure—
this is the *path of life and death*;
No coming, no going—
this is the *place of origin*.’

Iron Ox bowed and said:
‘All day I only turn the wheel and staff,
yet I do not recognize the *reed flowers facing the sorrel red*.’

The Master replied:
‘Just this moment of *returning light*—
this is the *place of origin*.
Laying down the wheel and staff in surrender—
this is how one leaves the *path of life and death*.’
And again said:
‘Without the east wind, flowers do not bloom,
yet when they bloom, the wind blows them away.
This is the *path of life and death*.
No clouds rise over the misty peaks,
the moon’s reflection rests in the heart of the river—
this is the *place of origin*.
Now I speak plainly to you:
If emotions fade and thoughts vanish,
this is the *gate of life*;
If intentions stray and the heart raves,
this is the *path of death*.
When the heart does not consort with the myriad *dharmas*,
one nature stands alone and luminous,
deeply still yet uniquely self-illuminating—
this is the *place of origin*.’

The Master composed another poem:
---
*The unborn, unmade nature shines serene,
No coming, no going—emerging from the Three Thousand Worlds.
To know this turning point of true origin,
One must tread through the void and pierce the Mysterious Dao.*

When the Master arrived at the Ilu Mountain’s Chongyang Cave,
a nun, Zhou Daolong, came to visit the Master and asked about *sitting in the bowl*.
The Master replied:
‘The *bowl* is the *origin*—
it is formed from the *golden origin*.
The *golden origin* refers to *golden emotions* and *wooden nature*.
When emotions and nature align,
this is likened to the *bowl*.
Emotions are like *waves*,
nature is like *water*.
*Sitting in the bowl* means abandoning emotions and stabilizing nature.
The small hole in the *bowl* signifies *ascending and descending*.
When there is ascending, there is descending;
when there is fullness, there is depletion.
At the time of stabilizing the *bowl*,
one must seal the mouth and remain silent,
upright the body and sit properly,
cutting off all thoughts and forgetting speech.
This is the teaching of emotions and nature aligning,
embracing the *One Spirit*.’

Then, a respectful scholar, Chen Hongdao, bowed before the Master and asked:
‘What is the *original face*?’

The Master replied:
‘Neither approaching nor departing from this.
If *original face* means departing from this,
how can the *Four Great Elements* and *Six Sense Gates* move and rest,
apply throughout the body and interchange in use?
If *original face* means approaching this,
even the dead possess *Four Great Elements* and *Six Roots*—
how can they move?’

Consider this: before your parents gave birth to you,
there were no *Four Great Elements* or *Six Roots*.
What is movement and rest?
What do you perceive?
The Daoist Canon says:
*Seeing does not see Me,
hearing does not hear Me.*
*Detached from all boundaries,*
*this is called the Wondrous Dao.*

The Buddha said:
*If one seeks Me through form,*
*or through sound to find Me,*
*that person follows the wrong path*
*and cannot see the Tathagata.*

The formless can generate the formed,
the shapeless can control the shaped.
The *original face* is not something to be observed through the five colors,
nor heard through the five sounds.
Without eyes, one can see;
without ears, one can hear;
without a nose, one can smell;
without a tongue, one can taste;
without a mouth, one can speak;
without hands, one can strike;
without feet, one can walk.
The *original nature* and *Dharmakaya*—
the moment they move, they are constrained.
When the *Six Roots* are still and settled,
the *original face* naturally reveals itself.
Now, when one moves,
it is the *Master* commanding the *slave*;
when one is still and settled,
the *slave* returns to its *Master’s* place.
Confusion and distraction are *ghosts*;
deep clarity and insight are *spirits*.
Those who practice to see the *original face*
must screen out all entanglements,
purify the *Six Roots*,
hold the mind in singularity,
allow not even a hair’s breadth of distinction,
let no thread of attachment remain—
then the clouds of delusion will naturally disperse,
and the *nature-moon* will shine brightly.

The ancients said:
*When the mist clears, the sun’s radiance gleams;
dust struggles to reflect its brilliance.*
The Master composed a verse:
---
*Seeing the formless yet perceiving the formed,
From the start, I never stirred a speck of dust.
Abandoning all myriad dharmas,
I reveal the unbroken original body.*

When the Master arrived at the Tai Bai Mountain’s Anle Nest,
a lecturer, Chen Hongdao, came to visit the Master and asked:
‘In *The Zhuangzi’s* *Qixia* Chapter, it says:
*The great knowing is leisurely and spacious,
the small knowing is partial and narrow;
the great speech is ardent and vast,
the small speech is verbose and petty.*
What does this mean?’

The Master replied:
‘The *great knowing* is leisurely and spacious—
it accepts all without exclusion.
The *small knowing* is partial and narrow—
it distinguishes between things.
This is the same *knowing*, yet different in scope.

The *great speech* is ardent and vast—
it unifies *right and wrong*.
The *small speech* is verbose and petty—
it mimics the appearance of chattering.

This passage speaks of differences,
yet all four arise from the same source.
The myriad things and myriad emotions
vary in their taking and discarding—
if there is a true *Master* guiding them naturally.

Do you wish to see the true *Master*?
Ah—
though it has no trace of entering or exiting,
all things are fully revealed, are they not?’

A Daoist disciple, Master Liu Zonghai, asked the Teacher: *"What does it mean to cultivate and refine?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"To cultivate is to refine one’s outward conduct; to refine is to temper one’s body and mind. Cultivating outward conduct means caring for orphans and widows, respecting the elderly and pitying the poor, building bridges and roads, aiding the afflicted and resolving difficulties—these amount to eight hundred practices. Refining body and mind means dwelling in stillness, guarding the environment, tempering the body and refining the mind, conserving essence and nurturing *qi*, refining the spirit and returning to emptiness—these amount to three thousand practices. Cultivating outward conduct generates *virtue*; refining inwardly generates *wisdom*. When both *virtue* and *wisdom* are complete, one transcends birth and death."*

Again, [the disciple asked]: *"Why is it that a man of sixty-four cannot cultivate his life?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"Humans are the most refined of all things, with a natural lifespan of forty-three thousand two hundred days. Their spirit comprises thirty-six thousand units, their original *yang* and true *qi* weigh three hundred eighty-four *liǎng*. This corresponds internally to *Qián* [乾]. If one fails to preserve and nurture it, allowing it to dissipate, then one perishes prematurely in midlife. *Qián* is the fullness of six *yang* energies, yet one does not yet know how to act or apply them. To know this and practice refinement is to become an immortal.

From fifteen to twenty-five years old, if one’s emissions and expenditures do not cease, the true *qi* diminishes by forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Jiǔ* [姤]. If one’s desires grow excessive, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes another forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Dùn* [遁]. If one still fails to preserve and nurture it, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes another forty-eight *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Pǐ* [否]. At this point, one reaches the central *qi* of heaven and earth. If one still does not practice cultivation, another ten years pass, and the *qi* diminishes by seventy-two *liǎng*, corresponding to *Guān* [观]. If one still fails to supplement and nourish it, another five years pass, and the *qi* diminishes by ninety-six *liǎng*, leaving what corresponds to *Bō* [剥]. If one still does not preserve and nurture it, at sixty-four—the completion of the sixty-four *guà*—the original *qi* is exhausted, corresponding internally to *Kūn* [坤]. *Kūn* is pure *yin*; one survives only by relying on the *qi* of grains, hence the name *gǒushòu* [苟寿, "barely alive"]. At this stage, death is near, and one can no longer refine the elixir. Those whose decline is even more severe may perish before this point, like an old tree struck by great winds or fire—its withering and death are inevitable.

All who practice must understand the measure of *liǎng* and adjust their efforts accordingly. The Ancestral Teacher said: *‘One gourd contains three hundred eighty-four liǎng*—this is what is meant.’*

A disciple named Chen asked about the *shījiě* [尸解, "corpse resolution"] method.

The Teacher replied:
*"There are five types of *shījiě*: those resolved by sword, text, water, fire, and *tài-yīn* [太阴]. Sword-resolution is like Guo Pu being executed in the marketplace, Zhou Pu being sawn apart. Text-resolution is like Zhang Lang’s form appearing on a staff, Bodhidharma departing with a single sandal. Water-resolution is like Feng Yi drowning in the great river, Tai Bai sinking into the depths. Fire-resolution is like Feng Zhi burning beneath a fire tree, Lu Xian ascending from a thatched hut. *Tài-yīn* resolution is when the corpse’s color does not change, the flesh does not turn green, the skin does not wrinkle, the eyes retain their luster, and the limbs remain supple—this too is *shījiě*. The flesh does not decay for a hundred years, and the body can rise again as a living person. Though such is the case, one still does not attain the Dao of the Heavenly Immortal—only non-death is achieved."*

That year, in the ninth month of the *bǐngyín* [丙寅] year, the Teacher arrived at the East Peak of Huayang and stayed at the Xiexian Temple. Catching rain leaking through the roof, he composed a poem:

---
*The roof leaks, yet I do not leak;
Others are busy, yet I am not.
I shift to where my body rests secure,
And all worldly thoughts dissolve.*

On the fifteenth of that month, the Full Truth Daoists Dong Gūyún, Wang Yíshān, and Hé Lǎnyún departed for the Wànshòu Palace in Dānyáng to perform the *zhǔbō* [主钵, "main alms ceremony"], composing a poem as they took leave:

---
*Deep mountains and secluded valleys are my home,
A life of simplicity I hold in pride.
My clay bowl ever holds honeyed wine,
My porcelain pot brews tea from *gòuyá* leaves.
At leisure, I point to the moon beyond the sky,
In boredom, I gaze upon flowers by the stream.
Today I bid farewell to friends and depart—
Gazing afar at forests and valleys, sighing in vain.*

At that time, on the twenty-second of the ninth month, they arrived at the Wànshòu Palace in Dānyáng. A military commander named Deng paid his respects to the Teacher, saying: *"I have long heard of your Dao, Master."*

The Teacher replied: *"I merely dwell in the mountains, nurturing my simplicity."*

The commander said: *"If one could truly grasp this ‘simplicity,’ one would have cultivated the Dao to its fullest."*

The Teacher replied:
*"To conceal one’s light and hide one’s brilliance, to reveal one’s true nature and embrace simplicity—though eloquent, one speaks not; though skilled, one appears clumsy. The eyes do not perceive colors, the ears do not hear sounds, though the mouth responds to affairs, the heart harbors no desires. The heart has no heart; within thought, there is no thought. This is how I nurture my simplicity."*

The commander asked: *"What are the meanings of *xìng* [性, nature] and *mìng* [命, fate/life]?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"Nature is the substance of life; life is the function of nature. Without substance, function lacks clarity; without function, substance lacks completeness. Root and branch are inherently connected—yet for convenience, we divide them into two."*

The commander asked: *"If nature and life are inherently unified, why divide them?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"Nature and life are originally one, but desires separate them. The ancients said: *‘Wood and metal divide the hare and rabbit’*—this is so."*

The commander asked: *"How does nature relate to the Dao?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"It is like the analogy of the Golden Elixir. True nature endures through kalpas, unobstructed in entering or exiting, hence it is compared to gold in firmness, steel in sharpness, and the elixir in perfection. Zhongyang Di Jun said:
*‘True nature is called the Golden Elixir;
Four false forms are the furnace to refine it into a sphere.
Unstained, unthinking, free of delusion—
Naturally it rolls forth to the Immortal Platform.’*
This is it."*

The next day, the assembly completed their inquiries.

The Teacher said:
*"Rotten wood needs no carving, and the clumsy man requires no effort to quiet his mind. Eloquence is not as good as silence, cleverness is not as good as clumsiness. A stone may contain jade but is harmed by its presence, and a clam may hold a pearl but loses its life because of it. This is indeed the truth without deceit."*

Then he recited a poem:
*"A hundred-foot green pine in the village,
Unmoved by the spring wind’s passing.
Its branches sway freely, tossed about—
Yet its roots remain deep, unmoving."*

The *Record of Adaptation to Circumstances* (Volume One and Volume Two) was completed.
**Song Han Dao Ren Wu Hou Zi** recounted the full teaching of **He Dao Quan**.
The disciple **Jia Dao Xuan** compiled and gathered it.

Someone asked: *"What is the principle behind Master Dong’s sitting in the encircled space?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"The Master said: The encircled space is one principle, but transmission differs. The encircled space is the meaning of returning to the origin and restoring the root—nothing more than cultivating stillness."*

Someone asked: *"There are three thousand six hundred teachings; which one do you follow?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"I have received the Master’s oral instructions, which lie beyond the count of three thousand six hundred."*

Someone asked: *"Do you mean an esoteric path?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"The Master said: ‘Four walls without openings, eight directions without gates—
The Great Dao is boundless, and void cannot measure it.
Because disciples vary in wisdom and folly,
Great and small vehicles arise.
This is the heart’s own deviation; the Great Dao knows no contrary or conforming.’
Since disciples differ in virtue and wisdom, and in depth of roots,
the sages established these three teachings to accommodate their capacities.
The term *vehicle* means a means of conveyance—
like a large cart carrying heavy goods,
a medium cart carrying medium goods,
and a small cart carrying light goods.
They raise disciples according to their sharpness or dullness of understanding—
this is the sages’ teaching adapted to each circumstance.
The *use* may vary in three ways, but the *Dao* remains one.
The ancients said: ‘Waters flow in different streams,
yet all return to the same source—
how could there be any division?’"*

Someone asked: *"Master Dong’s principle of sitting in the encircled space—
you must know it?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"The Master once spoke of the principles of dead encircled space and living encircled space.
The dead encircled space is when four walls surround you,
and the sitter remains inside, sealing the door to prevent exit or entry,
receiving meals at set times.
One must settle the body, extinguish thoughts,
calm the *qi*, and harmonize the spirit.
After a hundred days, they emerge—
those with resolve make progress,
while those without may fall ill instead.
The living encircled space is when the four great elements are falsely formed into walls,
and jade seals and golden locks serve as barriers.
A single spark of luminous consciousness remains within,
never dimmed, moment by moment.
The spirit does not leave the *qi*, nor does the *qi* leave the spirit.
Internal thoughts do not escape, external thoughts do not intrude.
Amidst chaos, one finds stillness;
stillness contains clarity.
The spirit guards internally, undisturbed by the outside.
Thus, a hundred days here surpass a thousand days in dead encircled space.
The dead encircled space restrains the form but fails to nourish the spirit—
even if it controls the mind, it is forced and artificial,
like caging a monkey or tethering a horse.
Removing the cage or rope, they remain as wild and flawed as before—
this is not natural.
If one can instead refine the heart through interaction with all things,
it is better than external artificial restraint."*

Someone asked: *"How does one refine the heart through interaction with all things?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"When one sees all kinds of beings,
not loving them means not being attached to things;
when one encounters all kinds of circumstances,
remaining unmoved means not being swayed by them.
Through such prolonged refinement,
one attains the three *dhyānas* of no-mind—
in stillness, one does not move;
in motion, one does not move—
this is the true stillness, the true *dhyāna*."*

Someone asked: *"From ancient times, even immortals have practiced sitting in the encircled space—
why is that?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"The early sages sat in the encircled space,
not because they had not attained enlightenment,
but because later disciples, seeing forms and stirred by emotions,
hearing sounds and moved by thoughts,
needed a hundred days of seclusion to keep their minds from chaos.
Thus, they set an example for later generations,
a convenient method to teach disciples how to cultivate and achieve success,
returning to the origin and restoring the root.
Even as Bodhidharma came from the West,
sat facing the wall at Shaolin for nine years,
and received the transmission of *shen guang* (神光),
the Master was not yet unenlightened—
all was done to establish a model for later disciples."*

Someone asked: *"Today, there are still those who sit facing the wall—
why do they not attain enlightenment?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"They only know how to adorn the external forms,
not recognizing the true essence within."*

Someone asked: *"What is the meaning of ‘covering the head to create transformation’?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"Covering the head teaches one to contain their thoughts,
facing the wall means seeing without seeing—
it is also turning away from external circumstances and focusing inward.
The *Observing the Dao Sutra* says: ‘Do not see what is desirable,
so the heart does not become disordered.’
The cultivator must not let the eyes perceive colors,
nor the ears listen to sounds.
Seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing—
cutting off sounds and colors, eliminating thoughts and worries.
Only adorning the external form brings no lasting benefit."*

**Master Lü** said:
*"To shatter the illusion of void perception,
then the fists come and go—
the best way to live.
Those who do not know the joy of containing thoughts beneath the covered head
mock the ancient Western Masters who came before."*

After finishing his words,
someone asked: *"Earlier, you said it lies beyond the three thousand six hundred teachings—
how exactly does one cultivate and refine?
Where does one establish the furnace and tripod?
What are the alchemical ingredients?
How does one use water and fire to temper them?
How does one complete the elixir?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"The heavens and earth are the furnace and tripod,
*jing*, *qi*, and *shen* are the alchemical ingredients.
Stillness and *dhyāna* are the water,
insight and illumination are the fire.
With single-minded intent, harmonize the three treasures,
compact them into a pill,
blend them into one,
and let them not disperse over time—
then the elixir is complete.
But even this is adding dust to the eyes—
discard the ‘one’ and merge with the Dao.
**Master Li Qing’an** wrote:
*'Propping up heaven and supporting earth are too vague—
only the original spirit may dwell within.
If one leaves anything behind in this,
how could they verify the Dao and attain emptiness?'*

Someone asked: *"Does this not risk falling into emptiness?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"If there is awareness and illumination,
how could emptiness be attained?"

Someone asked: *"If there is awareness and illumination, does it not inevitably cling to phenomena as they arise?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"Even though the lamp’s light illuminates narrowly,
its flame never strays from the stand.
He then composed a poem:*
*The myriad sounds of wind are void of sentiment,
the thousand rivers reflect the moon’s equal light.
Phenomena, from the start, bear no stain or attachment—
mountains stand majestic, waters flow freely.*

Someone asked: *"What then is the Dao?"*

The Teacher said: *"Where the Five Phases do not reach,
and before the single *qi* arises—there it is."*

Again, someone asked: *"Where does the Dao reside for those who cultivate?"*

The Teacher replied: *"Where good and evil are both forgotten,
and before a single thought takes form—
in the depths of stillness and silence,
one attains the Dao."*

Again, someone asked: *"How does one cultivate and nourish oneself to reach this state?"*

The Teacher replied: *"One must integrate the essence and function."*

Again, someone asked: *"What is the essence and function?"*

The Teacher replied: *"The function of the Dao is to bring peace to people and benefit all things;
the essence of the Dao must be in non-action and tranquility.
If one can subdue their thoughts and not let them arise,
naturally, they will be tranquil and without action.
All who do not stir their thoughts—
neither praise nor blame takes root,
anger nor joy oversteps—
these are the ones who guard the Dao."*

Again, someone asked: *"Are there matters of Heavenly Rewards and Hellish Punishments?"*

The Teacher replied: *"If there is no Heavenly Reward, then there is none;
if there is, it is for the virtuous to ascend.
If there is no Hellish Punishment, then there is none;
if there is, it is for the wicked to descend.
The Dao scriptures say:
‘No fear of imprisonment in life,
no suffering of annihilation after death.’
Under the current sacred governance,
rewarding virtue and punishing evil—
this is Heavenly Reward and Hellish Punishment.
The ancient sages spoke of countless teachings and doctrines,
with loyalty and filial piety as foremost.
In both heaven and earth,
convenience is the first principle."*

A disciple presented a poem to the Teacher, who then composed a reply:
*"A pair of fire-sinews, all of steel throughout.
Piercing straight through, they guide both action and retreat.
Never leaving the furnace and stove,
they come and go, ever in attendance.
Withdrawing and adding, clustered and refined,
flames blaze bright in a thousand hues.
Dispelling all hidden darkness,
forging pure yang.
Cast into fire, they do not burn,
thrown into water, they face no hindrance.
Drawn from the ashes, whole and revealed,
suddenly, they radiate light across the earth.*

Again, the Teacher wrote:
*"Within the furnace and stove, one stands best,
do not let dust settle on the walls.
Swiftly stir the buried flames of the Dao—
let warmth spread across heaven and earth like spring.*

The Teacher sat in a quiet chamber,
when a monk named Cōngdū came to inquire,
asking: *"If a woman approaches you face-to-face,
do you see her as a woman or as a man?"*

The Teacher replied: *"This is an ancient case for public discussion—
you must ponder and awaken to it yourself.
If I were to explain, it would hinder your practice."*

The monk repeatedly begged for an explanation,
so the Teacher scolded him: *"Seeing her as a woman is clinging to forms;
seeing her as a man is blindness to sight.
True nature is inherently undivided—
attachment to forms creates distinctions.
Turn away from the form and observe the mind—
all things will then be thoroughly understood."*

The Teacher again scolded: *"Learn to go like falling flowers and flowing water."*

The monk remained silent.

The Teacher said: *"Seeing as not seeing—
you know of men and women;
the heart without a heart—
there are still merits and faults.
The Great Dao knows no division of men and women—
why must you distinguish them?
The scriptures say: ‘Observe all as one’,
yet still, you cling to forms.
Vigorously pass beyond them—
responding to affairs like the wind’s myriad sounds,
perceiving things like the moon’s reflection on a thousand rivers—
such a one is a true sage."*

The monk bowed and departed.

The Teacher, still in the quiet chamber,
was visited by a magistrate named Hé,
who asked: *"Teacher, how do you practice sitting still?
What is your method?"*

The Teacher replied: *"I merely cultivate simplicity."*

The magistrate said: *"To have no skill in a hundred matters is to be simple—
how then do you attain the Dao of immortality?"*

The Teacher replied: *"My simplicity is the simplicity of the ancients—
it is sincere resolve and adherence to one’s proper place,
without contrivance, naturally so.
The *Thunder Classic* says:
‘Use sincerity as if it were stupidity,
use silence as if it were dullness,
use gentleness as if it were clumsiness—
this is it.’
If one returns to simplicity, roots in origin, and reclaims their true nature,
knows to preserve white while guarding black,
can generate wisdom,
transcend birth and death,
they may become an immortal or a Buddha.
How could this be compared to the simplicity of having no skill in a hundred matters?"*

The magistrate again asked: *"If the heart is still, it surpasses even a quiet chamber;
forgetting phenomena is not the same as forgetting the heart—
then, what use is stillness?"*

The Teacher replied: *"The autumn night sky, clear and blue,
the moon shines brighter when the clouds are absent.
Moreover, a quiet chamber keeps external demons out,
a still heart prevents internal demons from arising.
When both inner and outer are tranquil,
the body and mind are luminous—
this is the Daoist’s true livelihood.
The *Laozi* says: ‘Do not see what is desirable, so the heart does not become disturbed.’
The *Scriptures of the Immortal and True* say: ‘When external phenomena do not intrude, the inner spirit naturally settles.’
This is what I mean."*

The magistrate again asked: *"The Dao scriptures say: ‘Those who do not lose their place endure long.’
What is this principle?"*

The Teacher replied: *"This principle applies in three ways—
to ministers, commoners, and cultivators—
each has their own place where they find fulfillment.
If one does not lose their place,
they attain enduring longevity.

For ministers,
it is loyalty to the ruler and benefit to the nation,
concern for the army and love for the people,
justice without bias,
balancing strength and flexibility—
not losing their place means they attain lasting honor and wealth.

For commoners,
it is fear of the law,
understanding human relationships,
industry and frugality—
not losing their place means they attain lasting prosperity in their household.

For cultivators,
it is avoiding defilement by worldly dust,
remaining untouched by secular affairs,
a single heart in tranquility,
the Three Treasures blended into one—
not losing their place means they attain enduring life and vitality.

Moreover, within each person’s body,
there are the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber,
the Soul Stand and Vermilion Palace,
the Hidden Door and Life Gate,
the Mystic Pass and Elixir Barrier.
If one does not cultivate themselves,
these gradually decay,
and the master has nowhere to dwell—
this is losing one’s place."*

The magistrate again asked: *"The scriptures say: ‘Those who do not perish after death are long-lived.’
What does this mean?"*

The Teacher replied: *"For cultivators at the moment of departure,
when their vital *qi* is exhausted but the Dao *qi* remains,
when their body dies but their true nature does not perish—
they stand firm and unshaken,
still and clear as if congealed,
phenomena cannot lure them,
creation cannot bind them,
they do not turn or return,
free and at ease,
enduring through all ages—
this is the boundless longevity."*

The common man is otherwise,
his physical form is limited,
his lifespan fixed by Heaven’s decree.
The four great elements disperse,
the one true essence scatters in chaos,
ensnared by the affections of past lives,
driven by the forces of creation,
no longer their own master,
led into the womb to take rebirth,
suffering according to their karma,
endlessly cycling through transmigration—
thus they cannot attain enduring longevity.

The Sage of old said:
*"The physical form has numbered limits,
the Dharma-body is boundless and eternal.
Recognize the face of life before you,
still like the moon, clear as wind."*

The Master Ji said:
*"The form may be forgotten,
but Heaven’s true essence shall not.
Those who do not forget it,
attain the longevity of neither death nor birth."*

The Buddhist teachings say:
*"When mundane forms perish, the true nature does not—
the Awakened *Dharma*-body, untainted by dust.
Understanding the distinction of transient and eternal roots,
this is the Buddha’s eye seeing the Thus-Come One.
Such longevity knows no end,
yet only those who cultivate may reach this state."*

The magistrate bowed and took his leave.

There was Deng the Military Commander,
who sent Li the Cavalry Officer
to deliver a jade-bamboo staff to the Teacher.
The Teacher then composed a verse in reply:

*"Golden sprouts rise from the earth,
emerald leaves grow cold beneath the sky.
Skin smooth as lacquer,
heart sharp as frost.
Its nodes pierce the void’s realm,
its roots entwine with ancient Daoic halls.
Wise indeed is he who plucked it—
only the enlightened dare wield it.
In water, it knows depth and shallows,
on mountains, it stands firm.
It shatters the path of birth and death,
suddenly entering the realm of the Immortals."*

Li the Cavalry Officer received the verse,
bowed, and asked:
*"In days past, Master Zhi Gong,
why did he hang a whisk, scissors, and a ruler
on his staff? What was its meaning?"*

The Teacher replied:
*"This is the silent Zen of non-speech,
a metaphor pointing to self-examination and awakening.
I now speak to you instead."*

The staff is not merely the staff in one’s hand,
but the sovereign master within the body.

The scissors and ruler are but tools
to urge the practitioner to examine and measure
the uneven lengths of his mind’s thoughts and worries,
cutting them swiftly away.

The whisk is to sweep away
the mental afflictions that cling.

This practice lies entirely within the staff—
do not seek it externally.
If it is spoken of externally, it is not the true Dao.

Without thoughts to sweep aside,
without flaws to trim,
the scissors, ruler, and whisk are useless—
only the staff remains constant.

As the ancients said:
*"When the sky’s clouds and mist disperse,
a lone wheel stands revealed."*

The Teacher composed a *Zhìgū Tiān* poem:

*"Master Zhi Gong was no ordinary monk.
Scissors, ruler, and whisk hung on his staff.
A holy monk does not measure others—
each must weigh his own heart’s depths.
This wisdom can lean on the staff,
freed from worldly ties, returned to the home of truth.
If the mind’s measure is uneven, cut it away,
swept clean of dust, its nature bright as a pearl."*

In the year *Wùchén* (戊辰), the eighth month,
after the full moon’s day,
the Teacher returned to Huáyáng Yù (華陽嶺) and gazed upon the *Wàngxiāng Tái* (望鄉台).
After a hundred days of seclusion, he emerged,
and composed this poem:

*"A hundred days of practice—
its subtlety now profound.
Wooden Dragon aids in rising from the mortal palace,
Golden Tiger comes to chase the northern springs of the *Kǎn* (坎).
The Four Great Elements serve as crucible and furnace,
The Three Vermin (三尸) skillfully stir the cauldron’s brew.
Refined, a priceless treasure emerges—
its radiance piercing the ninefold heavens."*

When the Teacher arrived at the *Yuánjūn Ci* (元君祠) in Cháng’ān’s northern gate,
some mocked him, saying his crucible and cauldron were worn with age.

The Teacher smiled and composed this poem:

*"Do not say the crucible and cauldron are new or old—
only seek their truth within yourself.
From emptiness, plucked the Purple Lingzhi (紫靈芝),
it is the treasure of eternal life."*

Upon emerging from seclusion, the Teacher composed two *Wúmèng Lìng* (無夢令) poems:

*"A hundred days like polishing a priceless mirror,
dust gone, its light now pure and clear.
Seeing the original truth,
a path opens to the Dao’s holy saints.
True stillness, true stillness—
the divine mind itself reveals the right way."*

*"Again"*

*"A hundred days’ practice now complete,
unlocking the bonds already formed.
A thunderous cry in the cold—
flaming red light from the ocean’s depths.
Parting, parting—
jade halls and crystal towers grow whiter with snow.

The Teacher was at the Yuánjūn Temple,
when a Zen monk from Hǎifú in Xīshǔ came to pay homage,
asking: 'In days past, a monk asked Dongmen,
who replied in three turns: *When the World-Honored One held the flower assembly at Spirit Mountain
and raised the flower before the assembly, what did Kāśyapa’s smile signify?*
Dongmen said: *The one who sells gold meets the one who buys gold.*
The monk asked: *If everyone laughed, what then?*
Dongmen said: *Then it would be a universal offering of merit.*
The monk asked: *If everyone did not laugh, what then?*
Dongmen said: *If the transaction’s goods remain, there must be someone to pay for them.*
I beg you, how should this be understood?'

The Teacher said: 'Dongmen’s old answer was rooted in compassion,
yet you remain lost in confusion.
The World-Honored One’s flower-raising was a direct transmission,
Kāśyapa’s smile was a face-to-face acceptance.
If everyone laughed, it would mean the Dharma is universally equal,
with no distinctions of high or low.
He also said: *All plants and trees reveal the nature of perfect enlightenment,
mountains and rivers manifest the body of the Dharma King.*
If everyone did not laugh, then rivers and streams would freeze solid,
their waters unable to flow or drain.
He also said: *White clouds return to their caves,
the boundless sky blends into one hue.*
The monk bowed in understanding, thanked, and departed."

「When the Teacher arrived at the Huayang Mountain Temple, a virtuous layman named Zhang Bingyi came to pay respects. He presented a *verse* titled *Western River Moon* and recited:

*The love of parents is a single point of true essence,
Their bodies formed by the interplay of yin and yang.
They were manipulated by others for years upon end—
Still unable to return my whole body to its source.
Today I meet the Teacher’s guidance,
All past efforts were in vain.

At these words, he suddenly awakened—his mouth fell open in realization.
All thanks to the divine’s unseen grace.

The Teacher then continued:

*"The true essence is never obscured by a single point,
Yet it flows from mortal bones to immortal form.
Who was it that manipulated me for years?
Why did I not recognize the power of speech and departure?
I sought the Teacher’s guidance without true awakening—
How could my labor ever suffice?
Cease your idle chatter, do not open your mouth in vain—
Your own divine essence silently protects you.*

While staying in the quiet chamber of Huayang, a visitor asked: *"How does one drink without becoming intoxicated?"*
The Teacher replied: *"One’s nature has its sovereign master—
Alcohol cannot disrupt it."*

The visitor asked again: *"What of feasts where music stirs the heart?"*
The Teacher said: *"Music is indeed joy—
It expands the five *zàng*-organs, easing their tension.*
Master Sun’s *Essay on Nourishing Life* states:
*The spleen loves music; when it hears it, the spleen grinds away.*

The visitor pressed further: *"Is worldly music the same as Daoist music?"*
The Teacher replied: *"Worldly music is the clash of *gōng*-scale, *shāng*-scale, *jué*-scale, *zhǐ*-scale, and *yǔ*-scale—
The sounds of Zheng and Wei, disrupting the ears and stirring the passions.
Daoist music is the pure, external harmony,
Righting the heart and calming the spirit.

To hear worldly music is to indulge in licentiousness,
To hear Daoist music is to harmonize *qi* and preserve true essence."*

The visitor asked: *"What is Daoist music?"*
The Teacher said: *"It is the flute with no holes, the zither with no strings—
This music hums without striking, sounds without blowing.
The *Way*-Honored One says:
*Five colors blind the eyes,
Five tones deaf the ears.
With eyes blind, how can one gaze upon the Great Void?
With ears deaf, how can one hear Daoist music?*

The visitor rejoiced and bowed, then asked: *"Do ordinary people make music, or do Daoists?"*
The Teacher said: *"Ordinary people indulge in licentious music,
Daoists cultivate true joy and true music—
Not reckless abandon.
The Daoist Master says:
*True joy and true music come from drinking the essence of wisdom,
No need to buy—
Singing the soundless melody of the heavens.*

The Teacher composed a poem:

*"Worldly music is not true music,
Daoist harmony holds wondrous tones.
Ordinary people favor worldly music,
The spirit reveres Daoist harmony most.
Worldly music has limits,
Daoist music knows no past or future.
The virtuous listen to Daoist music—
It must accord with Heaven’s will."*

Someone else asked: *"What of the elixir of Inner Alchemy,
The refining process?"*
The Teacher said: *"Use the three *sān bān* substances—*jīng* (essence), *qì* (qi), and *shén* (spirit)—
Let the *wén* (civil) and *wǔ* (martial) fires refine them,
Not too much, not too little—
Balance must be maintained.
Child and mother must guard each other,
Returning to the Yellow Palace.
Then the Teacher composed a poem:

*"The elixir uses three refined substances,
Collected within the cauldron to brew.
Refined into priceless treasure,
Bright as the heavens, suspended in view."*

Wherever the Teacher wandered, he composed poems and songs to admonish the world—
*Poems Against the World.*»

The world’s path is thick with mud and water—
A slip will bring sure harm.
Do not lightly set aside your staff,
Nor neglect to guard your steps.

Walk ever the even Way,
Avoid the steep and rugged heights.
Do not sit beneath shade trees,
For cooling comes without fan.

**To the Assembly:**
The Four Great Elements are like a house,
The Six Gates must stand firm.
The beams and foundations must be true,
The walls unbroken, complete.
No wild wind shall topple it,
The wisdom-lamp burns steadfastly.

When the Master opens the true eye,
He sees the Heaven within the cave.

**On the Brocade Screen Mountain:**
The Brocade Screen ever knows four seasons’ spring,
Unstained by the world’s least speck of dust.
The Sage’s rinse drives back the waters of Heaven,
The Divine Wind rises—its chill invades.
The green pines know each other as friends,
The bright moon and pure wind as neighbors near.
In leisure’s quiet, sitting without artifice,
Unwittingly, the spirit wanders to the Purple Court.

**The Three Teachings Share One Source:**
Dao wears the scholar’s cap, Confucius the monk’s robe—
The Three Teachings have ever been one family.
The red lotus, white lotus roots, green leaves,
Green bamboo, yellow reeds, purple shoots.
Though forms and garments differ in appearance,
Their roots and origins are not divided.
The Great Dao is true emptiness, undivided—
How could one tree bear two kinds of blossoms?

**Exhortation:**
Do not boast of fine craftsmanship like the *lou-luo*—
Even when perfected, what good does it bring?
The sun at noon still bows low,
The moon past mid-autumn wanes.
Now is the time to seek the path’s heights,
Lest you stumble into the winds and waves.

What use are the Jade Hall or Golden Valley?
In the end, all is but a fleeting stain.

**Self-Composed:**
An old rustic of the mountains, bowing to the village folk,
My coarse speech and trifles are unworthy mention.
Though my vision dims, my heart remains clear,
Though noise assails my ears, my nature stays undisturbed.
The simplicity of my home has its own flavor,
The realm of purity leaves no trace.
It is only because I have drained the marrow of emptiness
That I now see the Original Sage of Beginnings.

**The Way of Walking:**
A staff of cold iron drags in my hand,
My feet wander freely, without constraint.

---

**White Clouds:**
White clouds are originally heartless things,
Their coming and going fear no distant peaks.

**Residence:**
Good and evil are both forgotten,
Affairs are left unattended.
Without coming or going, serene and tranquil,
One rests in boundless peace.

Within this, a single spark of *Zhēnru* [真如] radiance,
Brilliant and luminous, never concealed.
**Sitting:**
Stable and unmoving, naturally pure and free,
Preserving the time to cultivate the inner *Yán* [颜].

Not like dead ashes or withered wood,
A full moon shines upon my ancestral mountain.

**Lying Down:**
Letting go of the Four Great [大], attaining tranquil ease,
Legs stretched long, sleeping soundly without tossing.

Of late, I’ve learned the *Xīyí* [希夷] method,
At three in the morning, the sun ascends.

**Pointing the Way:**
The ox calf stumbles across mountains and rivers,
Its wisdom softened, gently led by the reins.
When it turns back, bowing in submission,
It rests peacefully, nurturing its seed in the *Dāntián* [丹田].

**Again:**
The monkey sleeps deeply, needing no pull,
A fine horse returns, truly deserving the whip.
Guarding the golden barrier to refine its nature,
It naturally transforms into a *Zǐjīnlián* [紫金莲].

**Again:**
This spark of *Língguāng* [灵光] does not stray,
Only when clinging to memory does it sink into muddy plows.
If you can let go of dust and filth,
The *Xìngyuè* [性月] hangs high, illuminating the *Zǔjī* [祖基].

**Again:**
If you still grasp at *Tàixū* [太虚] void,
Every head and object you’ll meet again.
Beyond that hand, none can reach,
Alone, one strides the *Miàogāofēng* [妙高峰].

**Pills:**
Strip away the skin, white as silver,
Refine *Yīnyáng* [阴阳] forces evenly.
When you meet me, don’t pass me by,
Lest you remain an ordinary hungry man.

**Chestnuts:**
Like thorns, their leaves like indigo,
Not to be carelessly eaten by the common folk.
Wait until the *Tàixū* [太虚] Void smiles with an opening,
And naturally, the *Zǐjīn Dān* [紫金丹] rolls out.

**Net Basket:**
No drop stored, no wind invited,
Lifted clear—every pore open and bright.
By the teacher’s guidance, my whole body becomes eyes,
Thread by thread, piercing the *Tàixū* [太虚] Void.

**Lantern Light:**
A paper shield and bamboo frame surround,
Within, a flame burns crystal-clear.
Eight winds blow from all sides, yet none enter,
It reveals the people on the *Cháng’ān Dào* [长安道] below.

**Black Soybeans:**
Silently turn, leap out,
No lingering in the embers, buried long.
Strip off the *Hēiqī* [黑漆] robe,
A golden body manifests in its form.

**Fan:**
The *Zhuāngshǒu* [匠手]’s palm lightly waves,
Flames surge red within the furnace without effort.

**Fly on the Window:**
Seeking light, it flies and touches the paper,
Unable to pass through, it hesitates in doubt.
If it turns back to its former path,
Suddenly, it finds a way to escape.

**Moth at the Lamp:**
For love of the red light, it deliberately flings itself,
Burning its body, ruining its wings, yet never ceasing.
Retreat a step, and there’s a cool, refreshing place—
Yet how can it stop its frantic circling?

**Broom:**
Always close to its owner’s hand,
Moment by moment, held firmly in grasp.
A single sweep—clearly gone,
The *□Wáng* [□王] sits steady in the *Tàixū* [太虚] Void.

**Cool Bamboo Umbrella:**
A single green cloud raised overhead,
Never leaving the hand that holds it aloft.
See how it shields those summer travelers,
Dust-choked and weary—
Those who have it find their bodies and minds refreshed.

**Shoes:**
Step by step, they follow the Great Dao,
Never sinking into mud or deep pits.
Suddenly, they tread upon the ancestral path,
And are cast off—this life’s end is tranquil.

**Self-Composed (Chóngchāng) [中昌]:**
Welcome the *Wèngxiān Kè* [迎仙客], #1
A *Chūjiā* [出家] child, let your heart be firm.
Visit the Dao, meditate early, and press forward.
Do not be lazy, do not stray—
A hundred years of life pass in a flash, changing your face.
Once you’ve left the home,
Seek the *Xuán* [玄] early.
Do not cling to the superficial, bound by karma.
Tame the *Mǎ* [马] of desire,
Lock the *Yuán* [猿] of mind.
In purity and stillness, you’ll see the face of the Original.
You who seek the Dao, hear my words:
Do not delay year after year.
Act swiftly, refine *Gǒng* [汞] and *Qiān* [铅].
When the *Jīndān* [金丹] is complete,
You’ll ascend to the *Chángshēng Diàn* [长生殿].

The *Hùnyuán Zhū* [混元珠] is in everyone,
But without a clear teacher, you cannot act.
Dust obscures it—how can you discern?
Obtain it, and you’ll escape the suffering of countless kalpas.
The *Hùnyuán Zhū* [混元珠] is rarely recognized,
Only because you grow thorns of your own.
Karma’s depths are thick—
Hard to exert effort.
Seek a teacher early, and find the way to dissolve it.
This pearl does not stain with dust,
Within the twelve hours, it never leaves you.
Through merit, you move—
Nurturing *qì* [气] and spirit.
Suddenly emerging,
It illuminates the Three Realms with radiance.

**Full Court Joy (Mǎn Tíng Fāng):**
This little lamp of the heart,
Wind cannot extinguish—
Everlasting through time and eternity.
Fools cannot see it,
And in darkness, they cannot walk.
No need for clear oil or yellow wax,
It can brighten and illuminate all.
Do you know?
All because of clinging to phenomena,
You’ve lost the original path.
Now I speak it plain—
Do not seek it outside,
Refine it within, and balance it evenly.
Where the *Huìfēng* [慧风] arises,
Clouds scatter, and the sky clears.
The sun’s brilliance spreads everywhere,
Demons of darkness are extinguished—
The Great Dao is complete.
Ever shining and radiant,
It breaks through darkness,
And saves all beings universally.

**The Happy Relocation of the Oriole (Xǐqiān Yīng):**
Perfect clarity is inherently complete.

**The Song of Nurturing the True and Preserving Life:**

*Ah, how the foolish fail to awaken!*
*Lost in their own delusion, they wander blind.*
*Clinging to dusty passions,*
*They spin through upside-down rebirth—*
*When will they dare to withdraw and turn back?*
*This spark of original luminosity,*
*Each one knows not whence it came.*
*Lost in the true delight—*
*They mistake thorns for the sacred *língchūn* [灵椿],*
*The immortal path obscured.*
*Rolling through depths of despair,*
*When will the heart open to truth?*
*Today’s youthful bloom,*
*By tomorrow may vanish—*
*Do not squander life in idle dreams.*
*Swiftly seek the true now,*
*Lest fleeting dust defile it.*

*The body must stand firm,*
*Then the Great Dao’s path is steady and sure.*
*To cultivate the true and nourish life,*
*I speak to those who study the *Xuánmén* [玄门]:*
*With urgency, turn back and save yourselves!*
*One hundred years pass like a blink of the eye—*
*What then of this fragile flesh, where to rely?*
*To lose the *yángshén* [阳神],*
*Becomes a *yīngguǐ* [阴鬼]—*
*No end to the trade of bones in endless cycles.*
*This life is no trifle—*
*Do not cast it lightly to death!*
*What is *shén* [神], what is *mìng* [命]?*
*The two—*qi* and spirit—are the root of all.*
*Gather them home as one,*
*Soon you’ll silently commune with sages.*

*The way of cultivation is simple,*
*Only forget the world and subdue the *shuìmó* [睡魔].*
*When the mind is still and clear,*
*The spirit knows no dimness—*
*Nurture the true body to emerge from *suōpó* [娑婆].*
*Do not extinguish the inner flame,*
*Gradually enter the gate of endless life.*

*The essence is like oil,*
*The light like spirit,*
*The *qi* like a lamp’s flame,*
*The body like its burner.*
*When oil is full and flame brightens,*
*The heart stands pure and clear—*
*Then you’ll see the truth, the lamp’s true owner.*
*If one is lost, the other falters,*
*In endless darkness you’ll waste your years.*
*Coming to this treasure mountain empty-handed,*
*You’ve lost the coins once spent to buy your life.*

*Awake, listen to me:*
*When *héhé* [和合] is one, no lack remains.*
*Refine the *jīndān* [金丹] with a thousand days’ labor,*
*And death’s cycles will all be pierced.*
*Cast off the mortal frame,*
*Exchange for the *xiān gǔ* [仙骨],*
*The golden-maned lion emerges from its cave.*
*One radiance shines through the boundless void,*
*Not consorting with foxes in their schemes.*
*The *Fǎwáng* [法王]’s seed is no hard task,*
*But foxes remain worlds apart.*
*Respect and trust the worthy masters,*
*Test their teachings now—*
*In time, you’ll surely join the ranks of immortals.*

**The Song of Self-Lament:**

*Since leaving the world’s dust,*
*My heart has ever been as one.*
*I vowed to awaken in the *Xuánmén* [玄门],*
*To rescue the drowned in the ocean of desire.*
*At first, it was hard to begin,*
*Yet I wandered reckless, in and out.*
*Just to have a free body is called the Dao—*
*How could I know that such folly invites rebirth’s woe?*
*Suddenly still, then insight breaks,*
*The monastery’s gruel now tastes like nectar.*
*Though I’ve left the world, my heart remains—*
*If the heart does not leave, all is the same.*
*With resolve firm and thoughts sharp,*
*I sought teachers and paths without rest.*
*On a mid-autumn night, deep and still,*
*The Master warned me with tender words:*
*Thank the Master for his guidance,*
*Now act with lightness and truth.*
*Though I’ve drifted through the years,*
*Still I’ve not found the art of endless life.*
*Crossing mountains and rivers,*
*Always anxious, always longing—*
*Till I reached *Xiāoshān* [萧山] by chance,*
*Where the White Cloud Master recognized me.*
*His words struck like thunder,*
*Yet in my darkness, I found their power.*
*All past deeds were overturned,*
*No longer did I seek elsewhere.*
*Walking, sitting—no matter,*
*Moving or resting, free from care.*
*Twenty years as a poor man,*
*Now I hold the treasure within my body.*
*The paper screen is shattered,*
*In boundless ease, I follow *yuán* [缘] as it flows.*
*Others cling to countless bonds,*
*Eating when hungry, sleeping when weary.*
*Reflecting now on past words,*
*I sought to use the *miàodiǎn* [妙典] as my boat.*
*Yet how many drowned souls*
*Chase waves in sorrow—*
*No turning back, no guiding hand,*
*Shallow fate, no *yīnyuán* [因缘] to pierce the depths.*
*This boat passed—no more shall come,*
*Another day, the winds and tides will part.*
*Wasted paper, wasted tongue,*
*No man will dare to act with resolve.*
*Only to beg for idle words,*
*While eyes bleed in vain thought.*
*What filth, what filth—*
*Better return and seal the lips.*
*When fate and chance align,*
*From emptiness, I’ll lift the *yúnshǒu* [云手].*
*Cease, cease, cease—*
*Draw a line to all good and ill.*
*Better guard this life’s pearl,*
*Let its light deter even *shén guǐ* [神鬼].*
*Silence now, silence—*
*Lest idle chatter waste your breath.*
*Few in this world know true harmony,*
*So I’ll keep my folly in the lonely cliffs.*

*After years of wandering,*
*Now I’ve cast off the fishing boat.*
*Let the great waves rise as they will,*
*In the depths of reeds, I’ll hide my head.*

**The Song of Lethargy:**

*All worldly affairs, past and present,*
*I’ve seen through—*
*Yet still I teach the heart to be lazy.*
*Let others chase fame and fortune,*
*I’ll not lift my gaze to see.*
*You rush, I sit—*
*As they come and go, like turning a millstone.*
*Who will let the busy rest?*
*In stillness lies the true labor.*
*Not lazy, but I love simplicity,*
*Though men mock me for my plainness.*
*Just for this plainness I find peace,*
*And pierce the *xiàngmén* [项门] to open the true eye.*
*Laziness hides labor,*
*Labor hides laziness—*
*Though both dwell in this world, they’re not the same.*
*Each day the *héchē* [河车] moves,*
*Three gates struck—*qi* swirls thick.*
*The true path walks, the crooked stops,*
*Where others delight, I find no joy.*
*If you’ll walk where I now tread,*
*You’ll align with the *tiānlǐ* [天理].*
*No need to cultivate without,*
*Only seek within—*
*Like the pearl hidden in the oyster’s shell.*
*When the shell cracks, dust scatters,*
*Its light shines clear, unobstructed.*
*Stillness in motion, motion in stillness,*
*Suddenly—wide open, the white jade cave.*
*Clouds of illusion drift away,*
*The moon stands clear in the sky—*
*Seizing the void, turning it inside out.*
*Moving or resting—both are ease,*
*Yet in motion and stillness, joy is found.*

The world mocks me for my foolish laziness,
Yet through laziness, I leap beyond the gates of strife.
The Dao is wordless, originally unsaid—
Thus I conceal my light, feigning clumsy ignorance.

Skillful craft is not as good as hiding its brilliance,
Preserving the luminous so it never fades.
Outer brightness pales to the light wrapped within—
Nurture it whole, and the Way itself takes form.

Await the thunderous crack of spring’s bolt,
Piercing through Penglai’s ten thousand leagues.

**Praise to the *Zhēndé Zhēnjīng* (True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue)**
Five thousand characters, each line and phrase
Resonates with profound mystery.
If a student grasps this truth,
No need to ride the *luán* [鸾] to the Ninth Heaven.

---
**Praise to the *Fǎhuá Miàndiǎn* (Sutra of the Lotus Flower of the Fine Dharma)**
Over sixty thousand words, each crystal-clear,
Piercing the Three Realms, shattering the dark.
If a student seeks to transcend birth and death,
It lies entirely within the Lotus’s seven scrolls.

---
**Further Praise**
This true scripture, the *Mìfǎhuá* (Mysterious Lotus Sutra),
Illustrates the three chariots of the fire-house—
Sweeping away filth, the pearl reveals itself,
And turning over, one arrives at the Law-King’s realm.

---
**Praise to the *Qīngjìng Jīng* (Scripture of Serenity and Stillness)**
The Most High’s golden mouth speaks profound truth,
Illuminating the Way, banishing all dust.
If a student follows its teaching and forgets self,
They become a being of Penglai’s cave.

---
**Praise to the *Bōrě Xīnjīng* (Heart Sutra of Perfect Wisdom)**
This Heart Sutra dwells within the heart itself—
The lost seek it vainly beyond.
If one sets it down with total ease,
Instantly, the earth turns to gold.

---
**Farewell to the Assembly**
Eight decades of illusion, a transformed body—
Today I depart, shedding mortal dust.
I bow to all Daoist friends of the Mysterious Gate,
Each must endure, preserving the True.

---
**Departure from the World**
The Four Great Elements are borrowed, not enduring,
Temporarily gathered in the dust-world to form ties.
Now my ties exhausted, I return to emptiness—
When next will I pass on the ancient teachings?

Ice melts, snow thaws—still water remains,
Form perishes, spirit departs—returning to the Mysterious.
If asked where my home lies,
I still return to the *Xiàngdì* [象帝] first.
