**The Azure Void**

The Azure Void is vast and indistinct, its whirling wheel turning within Qian, its rinsing platter floating upon Kun. Crimson radiance encircles the celestial thoroughfare: ascending to the well, it becomes scorching heat; descending to the Dipper, it becomes bitter cold. Thus the four seasons revolve, and the myriad things transform—this is but the secondary work of creation, not its primal origin.

The Boundless One is the Debater.
The Boundless One speaks:
The Emperor of the Yellow Wilds is called *Di Bei*,
The Emperor of the Purple Tenuity is called *Shen Zun*,
The Emperor of the Azure Void is called *Ling Huang*.

*Di Bei* reigns over earth, to whom mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees belong.
*Shen Zun* reigns over heaven, to whom the sun, moon, stars, and Milky Way belong.
*Ling Huang* reigns over the void, to whom wind, thunder, clouds, and rain belong.

The Azure Void is harmonious and impartial. The two Emperors convene in the eastern wilds in spring. Suddenly, *Di Bei* ascends, *Shen Zun* descends, and they meet in the wilderness of *Ling Huang*. The Emperor of the Azure Void, leaving his throne vacant, welcomes them beyond the wilds. All the treasures of his realm are gathered: flesh piled into rosy clouds, wine scattered as rain. Lightning dashes, thunder rushes, wind sings, clouds dance—this continues for months. As the mediator between above and below, none harbor resentment.

The two Emperors, overjoyed, are shamed by *Ling Huang*’s profound virtue and troubled by the unrest in the Azure Void. They vie to cede their realms to *Ling Huang*.

*Shen Zun* says: “I possess heaven.”
*Di Bei* says: “I possess earth.”

*Ling Huang*, perplexed by the names “heaven” and “earth,” asks: “When I look up, it is no different from the Azure Void; when I look down, it is no different from the Azure Void. What then lies within the Azure Void?”

The Emperors speak of heaven and earth—what are their forms?

*Di Bei* says: “My earth is vast in substance and thick in mass, the source of all life. Its center is high, its edges slope downward. Its nature is Kun: layered like an altar, gathering all things. It is honored to the eight directions, encircled by seas and the nine mountains. Its bones are rocks, its hair grasses and trees, its flesh soil, its veins springs. Sweating as dew, its breath is mist. Rivers and streams rush chaotically; humans, insects, birds, and beasts come and go in profusion. When it turns to face Qian, it arches like a canopy, venerating the five stars, interweaving the constellations, supporting the celestial sphere, bearing the sun and moon. At its center, the River of Heaven winds like a sash; at its ends, snow and clouds intertwine. The palaces of immortals and celestial halls are arrayed within—would that you ascend and dwell there!”

*Ling Huang* does not believe him, saying: “If heaven is like a canopy, what hangs above it? If earth is like an altar, what supports it below?”

*Shen Zun* says: “Heaven’s canopy is not suspended above; the whirling wheel beneath bears it, ever turning to the left, and the Three Luminaries follow it westward.”

*Di Bei* says: “Earth’s altar has a rinsing platter; its floating and congealing above it is what keeps it stable.”

*Ling Huang* asks: “If the whirling wheel gives life to the numinous, what contains the rinsing platter? I wish to hear of this.”

*Di Bei* says: “The whirling wheel is constricted below, and the rinsing platter rests upon it—why do you doubt?”

*Ling Huang* says: “Ah! The forms of heaven and earth are indeed as creation describes, just as you have said. I shall cease my questioning. My void is vast and formless, pervading all without obstruction, without inside or outside, without west or east. It is expansive and surging, azure and boundless, containing the light of the sun and moon, the sound of thunder, the hues of rainbows and mirages, the forms of dragons and phoenixes. I sit and wander within it, lie and drift upon it—all is floating and free, all may abide. It is open and embracing, without bounds or limits. Its longevity is not born of spring and summer, nor does it decay with the passing years. Before heaven and earth, its beginning is unseen; after heaven and earth, its duration is unknown. If this is so, how could I abandon my eternal nothingness to dwell in your fleeting possession?”

Thereupon, the two Emperors acknowledge *Ling Huang*’s words and return to their former domains. *Di Bei* descends to the Yellow Wilds, *Shen Zun* ascends to the Purple Tenuity. For months, they are uneasy, and heaven and earth close in upon themselves.

The Master of Crimson Radiance asks the Master of the Azure Void: “The origin of creation, the primal source of the natural—what is its essence? I long to wander within your realm and behold it. May I hear of this?”

Thereupon, the Master of the Azure Void, deep in thought, suddenly relaxes his expression and, with enlightened countenance, chants upon the Great Vastness, singing the *Song of the Hollow Void*:

*Without self it is so—this is the natural’s nothingness.*
*Without creation it transforms—this is creation’s origin.*
*Vast and full, its form is whole. Gazing upon it, cutting off thought—thus may it be observed.*

The Master of Crimson Radiance says: “If this is so, then I shall soar and wander in an instant. Pray, let your words be my chariot. I long to ride them in freedom, and shall not delay to depart and behold it.”

Thereupon, the Master of the Azure Void guides him, saying:
*Without self it is so—this is called the Mysterious So.*
*Without creation it transforms—this is called the True Transformation.*
*This mystery, this truth: without mystery in mystery—this is True Mystery; without truth in truth—this is Mysterious Truth.*

He hastens to say:
*Without being so in its being, unite with being—then observe the natural.*
*Without transforming in its transformation, unite with transformation—then observe creation.*
*Without mystery in its mystery, unite with mystery—then observe True Mystery.*
*Without truth in its truth, unite with truth—then observe Mysterious Truth.*

He speaks freely:
*Truth is true in mystery, mystery is mysterious in truth.*
*Mystery is without truth in true truth, truth is without mystery in mysterious mystery—then ascend to the heaven of the Great Vastness.*

*That which is without being is the beginning of being and nothingness.*
*That which is being and nothingness is the origin of without being.*
*Without being acts, being and nothingness are established—and creation moves within them.*

When creation arises, the void constricts it, wind propels it, water gathers it, perception senses it, qi connects it—and the myriad things are complete within it.

The void constricts, yet form endures;
wind moves, and function arises;
water gathers, and visibility appears;
perception senses, and thought emerges;
qi flows, and intent takes shape.

Form endures, thus one may thicken the root;
function arises, thus one may clarify gradualness;
visibility appears, thus one may observe transformation;
thought emerges, thus one may know change;
intent takes shape, thus one may fathom principle.

Thus, that which may thicken the root is the substance of the void;
that which may clarify gradualness is the function of wind;
that which may observe transformation is the presence of water;
that which may know change is the thought of perception;
that which may fathom principle is the intent of qi.

Therefore, wind and water contend to transform things—though things exist, they differ;
perception and qi give rise to manifold intents—though intent exists, it is not singular.
Revolving within Qian, it abides in constancy;
floating within Kun, it endures in growth.
Its movement is inexhaustible,
its generation boundless,
its transformation limitless,
its causation infinite.

Tracing its origin—what is this called?
Creation and transformation reside in the beginning;
the great and ultimate reside in nothingness;
the self-so resides in the void;
nothingness and abiding reside in the wondrous.

Observing where it resides,
the origin of creation and transformation may be seen.

Master Red Haze understood the realm of creation and transformation,
yet lamented the fleeting hues of the oft-emptied.
Thus, he draped himself in the radiance of Red Yang,
nourished himself with the qi of Azure Vastness,
to fulfill his countenance.
He abandoned rites of celebration and mourning,
minimized visits from kin and friends,
and wandered alone with the Great Void.
He came and went in lofty gatherings,
with wind-servants at his gate,
moonlight illuminating the night,
while silent discourse never ceased.

Those who savored worldly pleasures and coveted nobility heard of him and sought him out.
Beholding his empty lane and desolate hut,
their faces could not conceal their sorrow,
their hearts filled with shame.
They said to him: *"I have not yet secured my own person—how could I attend to creation and transformation?"*

Master Red Haze replied: *"I am creation’s confidant, knowing it in exhaustive detail—yet creation alone does not know me, leaving me wanting. I have never been remiss toward creation, yet creation owes me a debt. I shall go and reproach it, to console your sorrow and assuage your shame."*

Thereupon, he harnessed his steed of Red Yang,
mounted his chariot of Azure Vastness,
brushed his robes and bound his reins,
passing through the land of Nothingness,
where he encountered Same Void and sought passage.
Same Void asked: *"Who are you, and why have you come here?"*
He replied: *"I am Master Red Haze. I intend to reproach creation and wish to borrow your path."*
Same Void questioned him: *"What is creation, and what do you mean by borrowing a path?"*
Master Red Haze said: *"That which governs things is called creation; to traverse your land is called borrowing a path."*
Same Void replied: *"In that case, my east knows no transformation to create, and my land has no path to lend. Seek another route."*

Thereupon, Master Red Haze brushed his robes and galloped south,
passing through the realm of the Self-So,
where he encountered Origin of Change and sought passage.
Origin of Change asked: *"Who are you, and why have you come here?"*
He replied: *"I am Master Red Haze. I intend to reproach creation and wish to borrow your path."*
Origin of Change rebuked him: *"Creation is the neighboring land of my brother—have you not heard? To borrow my path is to reproach my kin. You are my enemy!"*
His retinue prepared to attack.

Thereupon, Master Red Haze brushed his robes and drove west,
passing through the state of No Abiding,
where he encountered Root of Causation and sought passage.
Root of Causation refused him: *"Have you not heard of the price for borrowing a path? If you possess a flying chariot and the luminous jade of singular emptiness, I shall open the gate for you."*
Master Red Haze said: *"If I had such treasures for chariot and jade, would I still reproach creation or seek to borrow your path?"*

Thereupon, he brushed his robes and hastened north,
passing through the wilds of the Great Ultimate,
where he encountered First of Life and sought passage.
First of Life demanded: *"Who are you, and why have you come here?"*
He replied: *"I am Master Red Haze. I intend to reproach creation and wish to borrow your path."*
First of Life scolded him: *"How belated is your understanding! The halls of creation may be known but not approached, heard of but not drawn near. Even if you borrowed my path, how would you reach it? To reproach it—is that not impossible?"*

Hearing First of Life’s rebuke,
Master Red Haze stood stupefied, bereft of all,
wavering and hesitating.
He turned his chariot around,
passing through the outskirts of the Mysterious Origin,
losing his way upon the herding path.
There, he encountered two lads—Divine and Change—
bathing and frolicking in the Mysterious River,
and asked them for directions.
The two lads said: *"Who are you, Master? Traversing the void, braving the mist and clouds, your carriage and horses weary from soaring through emptiness—where do you seek passage?"*
Master Red Haze replied: *"I am Master Red Haze. I once knew creation, yet creation does not know me. It has made my sustenance and use a source of shame among vulgar men. I intend to reproach creation. I bound my reins eastward, drove west, galloped south, hastened north, seeking passage from the four directions. In the east, I reached the land of Nothingness; in the south, the realm of the Self-So; in the west, the state of No Abiding; in the north, the wilds of the Great Ultimate—none of the four granted me passage. In Nothingness, Same Void questioned me; in No Abiding, Root of Causation refused me; in the Great Ultimate, First of Life scolded me; in the Self-So, Origin of Change threatened me. I thought the day was waning and the road distant, so I turned my chariot back toward the mortal realm. Here, I lost my way—how fortunate to meet you! May I ask for guidance? Yet who are you? Your words are grand and refined!"*

The two lads said: *"We are called Divine and Change. We herd the paths of creation in the Mysterious outskirts. We were just playing the game of Six Barriers, both losing our way. Fearing creation’s reprimand, we lingered and delayed—thus we bathe in the Mysterious Origin."*

Moreover, I bear the cares of the Dao—how dare I face the Creator? Yet how could you, sir, trouble our lord with worldly shame? Fortunately, you possess the counsel of feudal lords, so do not harbor even a single thought of the Creator’s displeasure.

Here upon the Mysterious Origin, how could we again observe our two lads at their frolicking swim? You, sir, have left the mortal realm behind, yet have never beheld the Creator, wandering lost and asking the way—how will you face the elders and brothers of the world upon your return? Why not disrobe and bathe with us, drifting upon the waves, idly roaming together? Once my *White Plan* is complete, I shall escort you to pay homage to the Creator—will that not set your mind at ease?

Then Red Radiance Master, his face flushed with floating light and sinking shadows, followed the current along the ripples. With the two lads, he rode the surging dark waves beyond the Six Directions, arriving in an instant at the Creator’s realm. There, the Self-So presented him with a robe of constant ease, and the Great Ultimate offered food of No Limit. The Creator’s domain shone resplendent. Red Radiance Master and the two lads donned the garments and partook of the feast, their radiance illuminating all within the Six Directions. Then they paid homage to the True of Transformation, gazing down upon the mortal realm.

For a moment, they set aside worldly glory and shame, all illusions beheld in the True of Transformation—only fearing that the Creator might perceive their coming rebuke. Thereupon, the Creator questioned the two lads about the whereabouts of the Dao.

The two lads replied: *"Nothing is lost, yet nothing is not lost—the Dao does not depart from the sovereign’s realm."*

The Creator rejoiced, saying: *"That which has no being is not lost in its non-being. That which is not non-being is not lost in its being. Released into the outskirts of the Mysterious Origin without bounds, you lads have grasped the art of herding the Dao!"*

Then Red Radiance Master, filled with the Self-So’s robe and sated with the Great Ultimate’s food, delighted in the Creator’s words, bore the Creator’s power, bowed to the Creator, and withdrew with the two lads, preparing to return to his former abode.

On this journey, he encountered the Great Void in the realm of Same Void. The Great Void said: *"Since you beheld the Creator, I have sought you in vain—your thatched hut stands desolate. I feared all was not well with you in the mortal realm."*

Red Radiance Master replied: *"Just now, I faced the Creator’s countenance, heeded the Creator’s heart, and heard the Creator’s words. I have known the supreme Dao to be without being—how could I perceive the mortal realm’s being or non-being? The origin of transformation: those who trace being observe its non-being; those who trace non-being observe its being. How to describe this? The countenance speaks as ‘words.’ Its spirit is profoundly obscure, its vastness boundlessly desolate—thus it is said: the obscurity of the numinous essence is hard to fathom, the desolation of the boundless vast is hard to detail. Distinct are the myriad forms in their endlessness, diverse the myriad hearts in their boundlessness. Therefore, those of old who ascended the Great Loneliness to observe the Origin of Transformation knew its workings to be unceasing. They composed the *Song of the Great Loneliness*, saying:
*‘Numinous is the Origin of Transformation!
Clear is the Azure Void!
Bright is the Red Radiance!
Obscure! Boundless!
Only the Creator’s work is without end!’*

Were one not to unify the distinctness of the myriad forms, distinguish the oneness of the myriad forms, harmonize the diversity of the myriad hearts, and diversify the harmony of the myriad hearts—racing beyond thought to reach the threshold of obscurity and boundlessness—how could one wander the Great Nothingness and behold the Creator’s non-being?"

*End of the Upper Scroll of the Outer Chapters of the Master of Mysterious Reality*
*Middle Scroll of the Outer Chapters of the Master of Mysterious Reality*

Master Zhang Zhihe of the Tang, styled Xuanzhenzi, wrote:

The *Startled Quail* Clan came from the East, the *Cunning Demon* Clan arrived from the Western Regions. They met in the wilds of the Central Plains and engaged in a contest of empty discourse to vie for victory in sound.

Thereupon, the *Bent Bow* Clan trilled and cried out:
*"I have heard that the sighs—‘xū,’ ‘xī,’ ‘hē,’ ‘xū’—grind the qi through the throat in bitter fields and rasping breaths; the tastes—‘shì,’ ‘chuò,’ ‘cuì,’ ‘huān’—suck in the sour, the sweet, the bland; the glances—‘nì,’ ‘biàn,’ ‘hū’—pierce the pupils with sharp cries and clamorous shouts; the strikes—‘jiá,’ ‘kòng,’ ‘gān,’ ‘nǐ’—resound in the ears with clanging bells and booming drums. This is the utmost!"*

Thereupon, the *Cunning Demon* Clan clattered and roared:
*"I have heard that the celestial bodies—sun, moon, comet, and blazing star—shine with dazzling clarity in the heavens; the peaks—‘fēng,’ ‘líng,’ ‘gāng,’ ‘yán’—tower in jagged, perilous succession upon the mountains; the waters—waves, ripples, stillness, whirlpools—surge and spread in boundless expanse; the specters—‘qiáo,’ ‘chī,’ ‘chī,’ ‘mèi’—lurk in the gloom, weary and grotesque. This is the utmost!"*

They believed that by matching drunkenness with exhaustive words, their cascading speech would never cease, each deeming their own extremes supreme. Yet the *Startled Quail* Clan sharpened its beaks and brandished its talons to stake its claims in jest, while the *Cunning Demon* Clan bristled its fur and lashed its tail, roaring to shake the earth.

The Master of the Central Plains sighed, saying:
*"Near at hand, in speaking of the body, the *Startled Quail*’s discourse prevails; afar, in speaking of things, the *Cunning Demon*’s discourse prevails. Yet these two lords turn their backs on the silent arena, exhausting themselves in a war of sounds. Though their flashing eyes blaze like lightning and their clamoring tongues thunder, they merely startle the echo in barren valleys—how can they resound with the Dao in the vastness of the sea?"*

The Great Loneliness asked Boundlessness:
*"In the workings of creation, the ten thousand images are not one. In seeking the ultimate of small and large, being and non-being, can this be spoken of?"*

Boundlessness replied:
*"From my observation, the smallest is great, and the greatest is small; the most non-existent is existent, and the most existent is non-existent. Do you understand?"*

The Great Loneliness said:
*"From what I have heard, the smallest cannot be great, the greatest cannot be small; the most non-existent cannot be existent, the most existent cannot be non-existent. What do you mean by this?"*

Boundlessness said:
*"Let me tell you: in the realm of the smallest and greatest, nothing surpasses emptiness; in the realm of the most non-existent and most existent, nothing surpasses the Dao. Why is this so? Emptiness encompasses heaven and earth, extending beyond all existence—is this not the greatest? It divides the tiniest speck of dust, forming what is within the smallest—is this not the smallest? Searching the six directions and finding nothing—is this not the utmost non-existence of the Dao? Emerging from creation yet inescapable—is this not the utmost existence of the Dao? Thus, the smallest is great, the greatest is small; the most non-existent is existent, the most existent is non-existent. Is this not so?"*

At the dawn of creation, the Nine Greatnesses contended.

Then Wind, howling with fierce urgency, declared:
*"Whirling and swirling in ceaseless motion, whispering and murmuring in hidden fragrance, rushing and roaring in boundless gusts—it fans the Primordial Chaos, stirs the four directions with its forceful bark, sets the banners of heaven flapping and the drums of earth rumbling. It wails and shrieks, lifts the waves into towering breakers, topples stones and uproots trees—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

Cloud, surging with qi, replied:
*"Vanishing in an instant, gathering in fleeting swirls, it drifts in dense, shadowy masses, thick and murky in its dim obscurity. It weaves through the heavens like a vast, unbroken girdle, swallowing seas and engulfing mountains, blotting out the sun to shroud the sky—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

Thunder, rumbling with resonant force, proclaimed:
*"Booming and crashing like a thousand chariots, fierce and clamorous in its rivalry, it rolls like wheels upon the earth, flashes with blinding lightning, splits the air with deafening cracks. The great waves roar like drums, the wild beasts howl in fury—those petty and insignificant things cannot compare to my might. Who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

The Great Waves, surging in tumult, declared:
*"Vast and boundless in their expanse, surging and swelling in their might, what sound is there like the thunderous roar of Kun and Peng’s wings? They overturn the giant turtles, shake the whales, shatter the celestial vase, and upend the ocean’s bounds—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

Fire, blazing with fierce intensity, declared:
*"Glowing and radiant in its brilliance, flickering and flaring in its dazzling display, it burns with scorching light, melts walls and chars the earth, scorches mountains and blackens the sky—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

The Sun, blazing with awe-inspiring radiance, declared:
*"Resplendent and radiant in its splendor, gleaming and glowing in its brilliance, it rises bright and clear, blazing with fierce heat, illuminating heaven and earth, melting metal and scorching stone—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

The Earth, trembling with deep resonance, declared:
*"Vast and enduring in its solidity, immense and unyielding in its weight, towering and rugged in its peaks, it crumbles cliffs and splits rocks. It absorbs the seas and channels the rivers in their courses, moves mountains and shifts hills without end—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

Heaven, roaring with majestic grandeur, declared:
*"Supreme and perfect in its vastness, lofty and boundless in its expanse, it stretches endlessly in its height, dark and deep in its mystery. It encompasses the waters, whirls the winds, and covers the earth and the firmament—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

Emptiness, resounding with profound silence, declared:
*"Vast and open in its boundless capacity, void and formless in its wandering expanse, it merges with the boundless, stretches into the azure depths. It expands without limit, envelops heaven and earth, gives birth to yin and nurtures yang—who can surpass the greatness of my greatness?"*

Thus, the Nine Greatnesses each vied in their might.

Wind struck first, declaring: *"Who among us can surpass the greatness of our kind?"*

Emptiness replied: *"I have heard the words of the Supreme One: the greatness of the Dao’s name may be sought and inquired of."*

Thereupon, Cloud stilled its qi, Wind ceased its howling, the Sun dimmed its radiance, the Sea calmed its waves, the Earth settled its trembling, Fire extinguished its blaze, Heaven quieted its roar, and Emptiness lost its vastness.

Then, guiding Thunder’s clamor, they entered the realm of the Dao. Sound yielded to echo, form yielded to shadow, neither existing nor non-existing, neither moving nor still. The Nine Greatnesses beheld this and, for a moment, retreated.

Thereafter, they yielded to the color of non-action, together forming the domain of non-action, enduring to the utmost limit of the kalpa, and thus it was.

The form of the Dao is sung, the shadow of the Dao is void, the sound of the Dao is silence, the echo of the Dao is its beginning—such was its ancient appearance.

Vast in its emptiness is Emptiness, nothingness in its absence is Extinction, eternal in its beginning is the Remote, still in its likeness is Quiescence.

It is named *Yi Xia Ming Mo Yin Bo Xuan Yuan*—why?
*Yi* (遗) to exhaust its loss,
*Xia* (遐) to distance its remoteness,
*Ming* (明) to illuminate its light,
*Mo* (默) to deepen its silence,
*Yin* (殷) to strengthen its firmness,
*Bo* (博) to enlarge its vastness,
*Xuan* (玄) to mystify its wonder,
*Yuan* (圆) to perfect its completeness.

Thus it is said: *"Virtue is attainment."*
Attaining the unattainable, unattaining the attainable—this is what it means.

What is attaining virtue?
The cultured proclaim virtue yet remain selfless,
Laozi embodied virtue yet remained childlike,
Zhuangzi’s virtue roamed alone with the spirit of heaven and earth, never condescending to the myriad things.

Alas! Liezi’s virtue rode the wind with effortless grace,
Yan Hui’s virtue merged with the Great Thoroughfare.

Thus, the vast and boundless virtue knows no beginning or end.

If my thoughts cannot exhaust it, how can I fathom the limits of existing things?

The moth that fears the night clings to the candle’s belly,
the insect that abandons its body dwells in a basket’s crevice,
the one that bears dust wanders in filth,
the cicada that sprouts from the seedling is rooted in the soil.

The basket-dwelling insect mocked the moth clinging to the candle’s belly:
*"You claim to be so adept at nurturing life—clinging to the belly of a flame, fearing the night, wary of dangers, weighing choices—yet the world ridicules your false brightness. Bewildered by things, you lose yourself. How can you compare to my carefree obscurity?"*

The dust-bearing creature mocked the basket-dweller, saying: *"You claim to be so adept at nurturing life—clinging to your body like a deer, confining yourself to a basket, advancing only when your head emerges, retreating in fear to the primordial stillness. Yet you suffer the affliction of hesitation, bewildered by things, losing yourself. How can you compare to my carefree obscurity, veiled in form?"*

The root-cicada mocked the dust-bearer, saying: *"You claim to be so adept at nurturing life—wearing dust like a robe, bearing filth like a burden, moving with sluggish steps, so that things never suspect your motion. Your form reeks of dung, so that things never doubt your existence. Yet you fear the perils of wind and fire. How can you compare to my carefree stillness, bound in body?"*

These creatures each mocked one another according to their own abilities. Then the dazzling spark heard them and mocked the root-cicada, saying: *"You claim to be so adept at nurturing life—hiding in the mouth, concealing in the eyes, emptying the heart, filling the belly, rooted in the feet, absorbing the moisture of water and earth without movement. Your spine sprouts, exposed to wind and sun, growing ever taller, free from the constraints of roc or owl. Yet you are burdened by your substance, hindered by existence. Should you encounter the calamity of digging or piercing, bewildered by things, you would lose yourself. How can you compare to my fleeting, carefree radiance?"*

The root-cicada replied: *"I have observed the marvels of creation. Among all creatures, past and present, who hide in the mouth, conceal in the eyes, empty the heart, and fill the belly, none surpass me in preserving life. Yet just now, I heard your voice but could not perceive your form, glimpsed your existence but could not trace its origin. What are you?"*

The dazzling spark said: *"I am born from the eye’s dazzlement, grow from the chaos of sight. When slow, I link like stars in a strand; when swift, I scatter like blossoms in the wind. Seize me, and I cannot be grasped; abandon me, and I cannot be forsaken. Call me nothing, and I am something; call me something, and I am nothing. My coming is subtle, glimpsed in creation; my going is silent, returning to the Great Void. Only those who wander beyond the realm of things can witness my carefree domain, where the round and the square are one. Thus, the perfectly round is not round yet can be square; the perfectly square is not square yet can be round. Who can make the square round is called the Great Round; who can make the round square is called the Great Square. The Great Square once said: ‘Long have I squared your round, yet you knew not my squaring.’ The Great Round replied: ‘Long have I rounded your square, yet you knew not my rounding.’ Why is this so? Because each possesses its own nature. Thus, the compass traces the void, yet knows not its roundness; the square traces the emptiness, yet knows not its squareness. Only those who roam the realm of the Great Silence, who set aside the compass and square, may be called the Great Round and the Great Square."*

A dwarf from the eastern lands recounted: *"In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called the Great Quail, larger than a quail, second only to the roc. It drifts upon the dark blue waves, devours great whales, and when sated, soars to the edge of the azure sky. The archer Fangfeng Yao, skilled in archery, crafted a great bow to hook all things. Gazing at the giant quail in flight, he drew his bow and shot. The arrow struck true. The quail’s enraged cry shook the thunder, and in an instant, its blood flowed like a river. Its falling feathers obscured the sun, its plummeting form resounded through the misty void, crashing onto the vast wilderness. The earth trembled, the Great Void echoed, and creation itself recoiled in terror. Fangfeng Yao and the crowd rushed to observe, and for ten days, they marveled. Then they climbed upon the giant quail’s body, gazing across the four seas, where mist veiled the earth. Thereupon, they summoned all the world’s cooks, raised cloud-ladders, and butchered it. The steam from the cooking rose like clouds, and the mountain forests were depleted for fuel. Its dried meat fed the Central Kingdom for seven years without exhaustion; its fat illuminated foreign lands for nine years without depletion. Its feathers were woven into ships, scattered across the great sea, called the Quail-Feather Vessels. Fangfeng Yao revered the power of his bow, fasting and bathing before offering sacrifices. Scholars and collectors of marvels from across the world harnessed their carriages to witness it. Such a display of archery had never been seen since the dawn of creation. Here it stands, unparalleled."*

**The Spirit of the Tides**

The spirit of the tides is called Jiang Xu; the spirit of the Han is called He Gu. They met in the wilds of the True Origin.

Jiang Xu asked He Gu: "I took you for water, yet you hang suspended without scattering, and by night you gleam—how do you differ from ordinary rivers?"

He Gu replied: "Generations have called me divine to this degree, yet what do I truly know? Have you not heard? I set the Heavenly Boat afloat, I pour forth the Heavenly River, enabling the Herdboy and Weaver Maid to gaze upon one another—this is within my power. But may I ask you: I took you for a current, yet you retreat and cease to advance, you flow with constancy—how do you resemble one who possesses awareness?"

Jiang Xu said: "Generations have called me numinous to this degree, yet what do I truly know? Have you not heard? The swift thunder’s charge, the drought egret’s flight, the white chariot and white horses—such is the Three Armies’ mobilized might—this is within my power."

Thereupon Xu and Gu gazed at one another in delight and laughed, deeming themselves the pinnacle of spirit and godhead, haughty as though none else existed.

The Subtle Dao, whose advent is called *Utmost Dark*, was in the wilds of the True Origin. Hearing them, it said: "What manner of spirits are you two? Now I shall speak to you.

I have witnessed the creation of Heaven and Earth, and thus observed the existence of tides and the Han. Yet you two borrow names from the mouths of shamans like Wu Xian, thrust yourselves into the age of the Spring and Autumn Annals—are you not being rather presumptuous?

Those who are deluded console themselves with doubts about tides and the Han, fabricating your existence as Xu and Gu. How is it that you accept the inquiries of the deluded without awareness, and steal the craft of creation to claim as your own achievement? Are you not the ghosts of the momentarily deluded, to be laughed at in the Yellow Springs?"

Xu and Gu started in alarm, bowed in apology, and asked: "We took you for a friend—silent yet unmoving, empty yet responsive—you expose our falsehoods and dispel our delusions. Do you too possess a heart?

We have heard that the subtlety of the Dao precedes the birth of Heaven and Earth, abides in the wilds of the True Origin, and is named *Utmost Dark*—are you not that noble one? What is your name?

We beg you to clarify the origin of our spirit and godhead, and the cause of tides and the Han. May we hear it?"

Utmost Dark said: "I shall tell you.

To understand the Han, observe the principle of jade: it bears patterns of purity and whiteness. Examine the belly of the firefly: it undergoes transformations from dusk to dawn. These are differences of substance. How can there be a spirit of the Gu?

Though the Celestial Han is vast, it is not something rivers can comprehend.

To understand the tides, observe the blood in the veins: it has the momentum of ebb and flow. Examine the leaves of the scholar tree: they have their seasons of opening and closing. These are responses of qi. How can there be a spirit of the Xu?

Though the ocean’s tides are mighty, they are not something the perceptive can see.

To understand my discourse, observe emptiness: formless yet unmoving. Observe the valley: without sentiment yet responsive. This is the utmost of the void. How can there be subtlety in the *Dark*?

Though the wonder of my Dao is profound, it is not something the heart can know.

I shall further tell you: in the wastelands of Kunlun there are creatures of cunning, burdened with superfluous hearing and redundant sight. They rely on my non-being, depend on your being, forcibly ascribe divinity to He Gu, falsely attribute numinosity to Jiang Xu, and recklessly claim to grasp the subtlety of Utmost Dark. The rise of falsehood begins here.

I observe within the great cosmos six things that seem divine yet possess nothing: the sea’s waves surge into rivers to become tides; the celestial patterns gleam by night to become the Han; fiery light flashes through clouds to become lightning; rain’s hues reflect the sun to become the rainbow; yang qi revolves in the void to become thunder; mind and wisdom extinguish boundaries to become the Dao. All that occurs has its cause.

It is not that your numinosity or my subtlety exist in isolation. Yet my non-being is not nothingness—what does your being possess?

Thereupon Xu and Gu danced in unison and bowed in gratitude, saying: "Truly, as you have expounded, we were deluded by a false friend. We wish to accompany you in the journey of no-mind, and thus pass our years.

In life, we were deceived by creatures of cunning; in death, we shall be buried in the wilds of the True Origin. How could we again vainly claim numinosity in tides and the Han, to be mocked by the ghosts of the deluded in the Yellow Springs?"

That summer, the Earl of Thorough Truth convened the Lord of Gazing and the Master of Forgetting at the parting of ways to discuss their love of the mysterious.

In the midst of their discourse, the two lords debated the existence and non-existence of the Dao, their arguments interlocking like a well’s chain, continuing all day without end.

The Lord of Gazing said: "I arose from the Pavilion of Observation, knowing that the Dao is not nothing and perceiving its being."

The Master of Forgetting said: "I sat upon the Terrace of Forgetting, perceiving that the Dao is not being and knowing its non-being."

The Earl of Thorough Truth said to them: "The utmost Dao is not divided by being and non-being. Have you not seen the three luminaries in the sky? Though they appear at different heights, the sun and moon differ in size, and the stars’ positions vary in breadth and narrowness—if you judge their size by distance, you err in assessing the sun’s heat and cold. If you speak of distance in terms of heat and cold, you err in judging the sun’s size.

Thus, there is no true difference in distance. Whether viewed from the side or from below, the human eye naturally perceives it so.

Consider a hundred-foot pole bearing a tray: whether lying down or standing, the distance is the same, yet the size differs. Truly, the eye has its level and uneven perspectives.

As for why the sun does not blaze equally in the east and west, it is because its light is oblique rather than direct, allowing the yin qi of this earth to ascend.

Thus, the Dao’s manifestation in the heart is likewise. In forgetting and observing, it is not uniform—some regard it as being, others as non-being. If you take the Dao as being, the Lord of Gazing would, on the Terrace of Forgetting, perceive non-being. If you take the Dao as non-being, the Master of Forgetting would, in the Pavilion of Observation, know being. This is merely the heart’s natural state in forgetting and observing. The essence of being and non-being is not distinct—it is due to the mind’s clinging and stagnation.

Those who contend over the distance of the three luminaries do not comprehend the subtlety of level and uneven perspectives..."

Those who contend over the being or non-being of the Supreme Dao have yet to comprehend the hindrance of clinging and stagnation. Upon hearing this, the two lords fell silent and withdrew.

Master Da Xuan said: "To reconcile the distance of the three luminaries, to harmonize the being and non-being of the Supreme Dao, to dissect the obscurities of past and present, and to excise the superfluities of indecisive discourse—such that the Lord of Gazing restrains his gaze and the Master of Forgetting stills his gate—is truly the power of a master.

Wu Sheng was skilled in the art of depicting ghosts. With powdered walls and inked brushes, his hand moved swift as wind and lightning. Sometimes the feet appeared first, sometimes the hands; once the body was assembled, it matched his words as if by nature, as though witnessing creation itself. Renowned throughout the land, he reached sixty years of age, yet none among the world’s painters of ghosts could fully grasp his mastery.

Master Xuan Zhen heard of him and sought him out, asking: 'I venture to ask—though the method of depicting ghosts has its techniques, why does its Dao never exhaust itself?'

Wu Sheng rejoiced and replied: 'Are you not a practitioner of this art? Why do you ask so profoundly?' Then, in the midst of their brushwork, he bowed to Xuan Zhen, poured him wine, and as the wine flowed freely, he again bowed, brewed tea, and when the tea was steeped, he dismissed his disciples, bowed once more to Xuan Zhen, and invited him to stay the night for discourse.

He revealed the method of depicting ghosts, saying: 'What skill do I possess? I merely have the Dao. Often, in the midst of tea’s clarity, I remain awake through the midnight hours, settling my spirit and emptying my thoughts, relinquishing the existence of all things, forgetting even the slightest inclination. After a time, in stillness and sudden clarity, in boundless and expansive openness, neither plain nor painted, strange apparitions and spectral beings emerge—thousands of cunning forms, ten thousand clumsy shapes, now born, now extinguished, coming without obstruction, their appearances inexhaustible.

I, grasping the subtlety of this Dao and the essence of its method, have made depicting ghosts my practice, yet I have never revealed its secrets to others. Thus, at sixty years of age, I bear a national reputation, and the world regards me as the progenitor of ghost painting. Since my passing into antiquity, ghost painters have flourished like forests, desiring to witness my art. They echo my voice but never fully, mimic my form but never exhaust it, imitate my skill with all their might, yet cannot fathom my Dao. Moved by your inquiry into creation, I cannot but respond in kind. Though I have never transmitted this to others, I ask you to convey it to future generations.'

Xuan Zhen thanked him, saying: 'To immerse oneself in the realm of subtlety is easy; to articulate its images is difficult. Fortunate to hear the Dao of ghost painting, I have glimpsed the threshold of creation. I shall not transmit it in your stead—do not think I would.'

Water borne as pearls is round yet not compass-drawn, and cannot be squared, for it departs from attachment. Embers shaped as wheels turn constantly yet are not rings, and cannot be broken, for they swiftly connect. Sunlight piercing water forms the shape of a rainbow, yet cannot be straightened, for it aligns with reflection. Drawing from the Yangtze to brew wine, it responds to the surging waves yet cannot be stilled, for it harmonizes with qi. A single raindrop in the sea merges with the vast waters and cannot be distinguished, for it attains their oneness. A tranquil heart returning to emptiness unites with the Great Void and cannot be divided, for it meets its heaven.

The sun and moon have their conjunctions of jade disks; death and life have their cycles of recurrence. To determine the conjunction of jade disks is to know that eclipses intersect at fixed times. To comprehend the cycles of recurrence is to know that death and life meet at appointed seasons.

Thus, when the moon obscures the sun, its light dims; when the moon passes, the sun shines again. When the sun faces the moon, its brilliance prevails; when it turns away, the moon grows bright. Thus, when death replaces life, the soul transforms; when death passes, life returns. When life forgets death, consciousness is empty; when this forgetting is lost, death appears.

Yet the moon’s brightness derives from the sun’s illumination; death’s appearance arises from life’s knowledge. Without illumination, the moon would not shine; without knowledge, death would not be seen. Moreover, the intersection of eclipses cannot harm the bodies of the sun and moon; the meeting of death and life cannot alter the spirit of the perfected. Their bodies unharmed, the sun and moon have no fear of eclipses; their spirits unchanged, the perfected have no terror of death and life.

That which exists was not previously non-existent; that which is non-existent was not previously existent. Yet the existence of what was non-existent does not truly exist, and the non-existence of what was existent does not truly not exist—this is the ultimate of being and non-being. Thus, what exists now may suddenly vanish, yet it is not that what was non-existent in the past has now come to be; what is non-existent now may suddenly appear, yet it is not that what existed in the past has now ceased to be—this is the divergence of time.

As for that which has neither past nor present, linking the non-existence of what has passed without distinction, and that which has neither present nor future, merging the being and non-being of what is to come without difference—this is the sameness of time. Those who diverge in time take it as inevitable, yet there are times when it is not. Those who are the same in time take it as not inevitable, yet there are times when it must be.

Then the shadow asked the light: 'I am dim in the body’s yin, while you are radiant in the substance’s yang. Your beginning is my remnant; your middle, my end; your setting, my extinction; your clarity, my brightness. Why does your favor lack constancy, causing my commands to have no permanence?'

The light answered the shadow: 'You are nothing in emptiness, something in substance; you fly with wings, run with feet, curve with hooks, straighten with bows. When you draw near a candle, you emerge beyond your body; when you retreat from a mirror, you enter within my substance. Is your lack of constancy not also my own lack of permanence?

Yet though you are the same, I may still be understood. What I find strange in my excesses, even I do not know. Why? When I encounter the embrace of a burning mirror, I invert your face. When I suffer the eclipse of Rāhu, I bend your form. I would inquire of creation, exhaust principle and fulfill nature, yet what I do not know—is this not fate?'"

The shadow laughed and said: "Sir, first gather your light, and I shall extinguish my shadow. Being and non-being depend entirely on you. Why should I, who am neither crooked nor straight, rashly ascribe this to the mandate of creation?

When silence comes, silence is one—stillness can unify it. When silence is two, stillness can dualize it. Silence as one is non-being; stillness as one is being. Silence as two is neither being nor non-being; stillness as two is both being and non-being. The one of one does not depart from two; the two of two does not depart from one. Thus, one who knows that stillness is not one and understands that silence is not two—this is called the true One.

The true One is without one or two, without stillness or silence, without these four, and even without their absence—this is called true Non-being. Only one who roams the realm of true Non-being may then behold the visage of the true One. One who roams the realm of true Non-being and beholds the visage of the true One thereby perceives the manifold non-beings."

Thereupon, Stillness addressed Silence: "As for these manifold non-beings, no one can name them. If I must force a name upon them, I call them the *Vast Non-being’s Realm*. This *Vast Non-being’s Realm*—no one can describe it. If I must force a description, can you listen?"

Silence replied: "I can."

Thereupon, Stillness composed his bearing, regulated his qi, and settled into profound non-being, until both forgot themselves. Silence, awakening, said: "Before, I heard its name; now I have seen its non-being. Now, I hear its description, yet I do not see its non-being. Is this what is meant by the *Vast Non-being’s Description*?"

Stillness, perceiving, said: "Just now, you and I engaged in subtle discourse, and you truly heard it. You may be called perspicacious in subtleties."

From Silence’s return onward, Stillness ceased all discourse.
