**Treatise on the Dao-Essence**
By Master Tongxuan

**Discourse on the Upper Scroll of the Laozi’s Dao Classic**

The Dao is the all-pervading inception of transformation; virtue is the consummation of things’ completion. Since generation and completion are manifest, the two names become evident. When activity ceases and return is made to the source, the two are ever one.

Because the two are ever one, the Dao has no pervasion beyond virtue, and virtue has no accord apart from the Dao. Because the one yet remains two, the Dao holds the position of transformative pervasion, and virtue marks the standard of consummate fulfillment. Ever one, ever two—two and one are all-pervading. Since all-pervading discernment distinguishes them, they are named *Dao* and *virtue*.

**Question:** You say the Dao is the all-pervading inception of transformation—what kind of inception is this?
**Answer:** It is the inception of the nature of things.
**How is this known?**
The chapter states, “Virtue is the consummation of things’ completion,” from which we know that nature arises from the Dao, and form is born of virtue.

**Question:** If this is so, why does the Classic say, “The Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures”?
**Answer:** Tracing back to the root and origin, the Dao is thus called “giving birth.” When form is established and nurtured, it is termed “nurturing.”

**Question:** As for the inception of nature’s root—does it have a name, or is it nameless?
**Answer:** Both are acceptable.
**Question:** If it is both named and nameless, why does the Classic say, “Nameless, it is the mother of the ten thousand things,” and not speak of it as named?
**Answer:** The Dao is the designation of all-pervading generation. If it pervades, it has bounds; if it has bounds, it can be named. Thus, what can be spoken of and named is not the eternal.

Yet the essence of the Dao is vast and all-encompassing, its meaning not confined to one. Now, by lodging the fishing-line in the unfathomable, it is only to cast off the coarse and near, to reveal the wondrous source, and make it possible to awaken.

**Question:** This vast and all-encompassing Dao—is it the same as or different from things?
**Answer:** It is ever the same, ever different.
Things take the Dao as their essence, and the Dao in turn takes things as its essence. Upon this single essence, there arise good and evil, right and wrong, life and death, adversity and harmony. It is like fish, which live by water yet also die by water; or people, who walk by means of the earth, fall by means of the earth, and rise again by means of the earth.

**Question:** The Classic speaks of “the Dao giving birth, virtue nurturing,” and again says, “Giving birth to them, nurturing them—this is called mysterious virtue.” Earlier it says the Dao gives birth, later it says virtue gives birth—why is this?
**Answer:** The earlier statement, “the Dao gives birth,” ascribes merit to the root. The later statement, “virtue gives birth,” discusses the actual generation of distinct forms.
**How is this known?**
The union of yin and yang establishes generation and transformation, with yang occupying the honored position. Just as ruler and minister share governance, yet merit returns to the sovereign, the actual essence of the myriad things is born of virtue. Tracing the root to its source, it is thus said the Dao gives birth.

The Dao gives birth to the undifferentiated essence, the nameless inception. Its principle pervades the ten thousand things, its mystery extreme within the cycle. Vague and indistinct, it cannot be called “being”; yet within it there is something, so it cannot be called “non-being.” Above, it is not constrained; below, it is not obscured. Approaching it, there is no head; following it, there is no rear. Its origin is unknowable, its explanation unattainable.

Yet it is the form of the formless, the image of the imageless, the speech of the unspeakable—speech that fills the world. Once form and name become manifest, the common and the sagely are distinguished. Yet the common do not awaken on their own; they must accumulate resonance to seek communion. The sagely do not abandon things; they also respond to opportunities to establish teachings. Since opportunities and teachings vary, there arise ten thousand differences. Summarizing their near and uniform response, we call it *Dao* and *virtue*.

The Dao takes all-pervadingness as its source; virtue takes self-attainment as its meaning. All-pervading, there is no principle it does not penetrate; self-attained, there is no nature it does not attain. All-pervading is nameless, yet we force a name upon the nameless. Self-attainment is non-attainment, yet we display its nearness by its designation. The designation speaks of the nearness of meritorious virtue; virtue takes diligent practice as its foremost. Forcing a name upon the nameless, the Dao takes daily diminution as its priority. Practice it diligently, and there is no action that is not complete; diminish it again and again, and there is no encumbrance that is not removed. Forgetting both Dao and virtue, one mystically unites self and other. Thus one can be greatly full yet seem empty, its use inexhaustible. Vast without exterior, minute without interior, it circulates and transforms without ceasing, accomplishing all things.

Therefore, the ten thousand things, flourishing in their forms and names, moving and growing, all rely on Dao and virtue to complete their forms. The Classic says, “The Dao is the sanctuary of the ten thousand things.” Thus the perfected one, Laozi, responding to the world in the Zhou era, propagated the mysterious wind to save the age. He established the two names of Dao and virtue as the aim of his teaching.

Yet teaching does not manifest on its own; manifestation must have a cause. Tracing its cause, it originates with Laozi. Before the image of the Lord, he is named “Lao.” Responding to transformation and generation, he is named “the Child.” His teaching’s essence is all-pervading, thus he is named “Dao.” The ultimate principle does not change, so it is called a “Classic.” Before the four ranks, it is named “Upper,” hence *Laozi’s Dao Classic: Upper Scroll*.

**Question:** What is the essence of the undifferentiated?
**Answer:** It takes emptiness and the ten thousand beings as its essence.
**Question:** If the undifferentiated takes emptiness and the ten thousand beings as its essence, are the undifferentiated essence and the Dao one or two?
**Answer:** They are both one and two.
**Question:** Please explain the reason.
**Answer:** They are two in that the undifferentiated, based on its essence, reveals the name “Dao”; when its essence pervades, it is called “pervasion.” Since pervasion and inclusion are distinct in meaning, it is thus said they are two. They are one in that the Dao has no separate pervasion—when inclusion is distinguished, pervasion is the aim. The undifferentiated has no separate inclusion—when inclusion and pervasion are the focus, it is thus said they are one.

**Question:** If you say the undifferentiated can pervade and include, then whatever the ten thousand things pervade is the undifferentiated. If the undifferentiated is things, and things are the Dao, with no distinction between Dao and things, what is there to cultivate?
**Answer:** Clearly, cultivation refers to distinctions in the essence. The undifferentiated itself has no meaning of cultivation. To apply teaching to the essence is to confuse categories.

**Question:** Are the undifferentiated and the Great Image the same or different?

**Answer:** They are both the same and different.
How is this known? The Great Image is a name, while the undifferentiated completion is the essence. Since name and essence have distinct meanings, they are known to be different. Yet the name is not a separate designation from the essence—it names this very essence; the essence is not a separate undifferentiation from the name—it is called the essence. Thus, they are said to be the same.

**Question:** If so, can the undifferentiated completion and the Great Image mutually encompass each other?
**Answer:** They can indeed mutually encompass. Differentiated, they are distinct; undifferentiated, they are the same. If one discusses their reality, the name has no reality beyond itself, so reality can encompass the name. If one distinguishes meaning by name, reality is not beyond the name, so the name can encompass reality. Name and reality are one—why hesitate over their mutual encompassment?

**Question:** The chapter states that the Great Image has no essence, while the undifferentiated completion is essence. If the undifferentiated and the Image are not distinct, why does one exist while the other does not?
**Answer:** The Great Image is a name; the undifferentiated completion is reality. The name first invokes reality—how could they be the same?

**Question:** Between name and reality, which comes first and which follows?
**Answer:** They alternate in priority. If one speaks in terms of essence, reality precedes the name; if one distinguishes by meaning, the name precedes reality.

**Question:** If reality precedes the name, why not first speak of reality, then discuss the Great Image, and afterward the undifferentiated completion?
**Answer:** To distinguish meaning, nothing is revealed without a name. Though the meaning of the name is manifest, the designation of the essence is not yet established, so the Great Image is first declared to have no essence. Yet the Image is not vainly posited—it must have a wondrous reality. This wondrous reality is all-pervading, hence called the undifferentiated completion.

**Question:** When speaking of the undifferentiated completion, is it the undifferentiated completion speaking of itself, or is it things speaking of it?
**Answer:** Both are valid.
When the undifferentiated completion speaks of itself, it has no separate undifferentiation—things are the undifferentiated. The things spoken of do not depart from the undifferentiated—what else could they be? Thus, it is said the undifferentiated completion speaks of itself.
When things speak of the undifferentiated completion, since things have distinctions, distinctions are not undifferentiated. What is spoken of is things—how could they be undifferentiated? Thus, it is said things speak of the undifferentiated completion.
The earlier statement of "undifferentiated speaking" refers to a person’s body speaking of itself. The later statement of "things speaking" refers to distinctions within the body, where the mouth speaks of the body—not the body speaking of itself. Thus, it is called "things speaking."

**Question:** When it is said that the essence of the Dao is empty and still, what is meant by "empty"? What is meant by "still"?
**Answer:** The essence has no form or substance—this is called "empty." Its principle has no sound or echo—this is called "still." Thus, it is said to be empty and still.

**Question:** Is this emptiness and stillness the essence of the essence-school or the essence of the teaching-school?
**Answer:** Both are valid.

**Question:** Please explain the reason.
**Answer:** Though "empty and still" share the same name, what they signify differs. How is this known?
When speaking of the Dao as taught, the profound transcends form, residing beyond things. It reveals the Dao in the realm of purity and ascent, while things dwell in the defiled and accumulated. To guide the defiled toward the true, distant designations are provisionally employed.
When speaking of the Dao as essence, the essence of the Dao is fundamentally still, eternally without beginning or end. This principle of eternal absence pervades all—thus it is called the Dao as essence.

**Question:** Is the empty and still essence of the Dao as essence the same as or different from the essence of the undifferentiated completion?
**Answer:** They are both the same and different.

**Question:** Please explain the reason.
**Answer:** The essence of the empty and profound is undifferentiated and still without distinction—thus they are called the same. The undifferentiated encompasses things, while stillness has no essence—thus they are called different.

**Question:** When it is said that stillness has no essence, does this mean stillness is separate from the undifferentiated and thus without things, or that the undifferentiated itself is without things?
**Answer:** In principle, they are originally one.
Now, when clarifying the essence of the undifferentiated and stillness, this is distinguished by the meaning of truth and delusion. If one distinguishes essence by delusion, stillness is eternally undifferentiated.
The scripture states: *"There is a thing undifferentiated, born before heaven and earth."* Thus, from beginning to end, there is nothing it does not encompass.
If one distinguishes essence by truth, the undifferentiated is eternally still.
The scripture states: *"Abiding in the great transformation, fundamentally empty and vast, the great void freely lodges—form dissolves with color."* From this, one knows that what exists today is the essence eternally still.

**Question:** The essence of the ten thousand things is real, not empty. How can an essence with substance be used as if it were without?
**Answer:** The essence of the ten thousand things arises from karmic conditions, defiled and impermanent, their affairs turning with the mind. It is like the eye afflicted with a film, seeing floating hairs in the sky. Once the film is removed, the hairs vanish of themselves. When human karma is exhausted, the three realms likewise cease to be.

**Question:** In truth, the undifferentiated essence is eternally still; in delusion, the still essence is eternally undifferentiated. Are the undifferentiated and stillness eternally separate, or do they ever communicate?
**Answer:** When delusion is removed, the undifferentiated becomes still; when truth is defiled, stillness becomes undifferentiated. Truth and delusion have no fixed nature—undifferentiated and stillness follow the mechanism. The meaning of communication and separation is roughly thus determined.

**Question:** If the undifferentiated and stillness have no fixed nature, and truth and delusion follow the mechanism, when delusion and truth depart, are the undifferentiated and stillness then fixed?
**Answer:** It is said that stillness manifests in truth and the undifferentiated arises in delusion. With the absence of truth and delusion, where do the undifferentiated and stillness reside? There is no undifferentiated to be undifferentiated, no stillness to be still.

**Question:** If the names of truth and delusion are extinguished, and the undifferentiated and stillness likewise cease to be, then what is neither undifferentiated nor still—what is it ultimately called?
**Answer:** The undifferentiated is named for its generation and transformation; stillness is designated for the removal of delusion. Now, to enter the profound, stillness is spoken of to dispel the undifferentiated. Once stillness and the undifferentiated are removed, there is no stillness to be still. With no stillness to be still, what name remains? Thus, the scripture states: *"Nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things."* The treatise says: *"Neither speech nor silence—meaning reaches its limit."* It also states: *"What can be spoken of are the coarse aspects of things; what can be conceived are their refined aspects. What cannot be distinguished by speech or fathomed by thought transcends refinement and coarseness."*
**Question on the Discourse of the Dao:**
The Dao is neither being nor non-being, without end or beginning. Its perfect essence pervades the ten thousand things, its subtlety transcending form and name. Yet the currents of hearing and seeing have not attained profound understanding, so within the realm of ineffable designations, it is forcibly named the Dao.

The forcibly named Dao is precisely the beginning of the ten thousand things. From this beginning, they draw sustenance for generation; once qi and form become manifest, taking its capacity for bearing and supporting, it is called the Mother. Yet the Mother returns to the cultivation of virtue as its essence, while the Beginning takes "no grasping" as its guiding principle. When Beginning and Mother are both dissolved, the profound pervades self and other. To distinguish its meaning in this pervading, it is named the Dao.

**Question:** *"Nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things; named is the mother of the ten thousand things."* Both Beginning and Mother possess the meaning of generation—how do they differ?

**Answer:** Without form or name, it serves as the unborn source, thus it is the Beginning of things. Heaven and Earth possess form and name, yet only generate generation—thus they are the Mother of things.

**Question:** When forcibly naming it, is this because the quiescent essence *can* be forcibly named, or because things *compel* the naming? Or is it that the quiescent essence is without forced naming, yet the naming arises of itself?

**Answer:** The naming arises of itself; the forcing does not pertain to the essence.

**Question:** If the forcing does not pertain to the essence, what benefit does speaking of "forcing" confer?

**Answer:** Precisely because the essence cannot be forced, it *can* be forced. Because forcing the essence confers no benefit, it *can* confer benefit.

**Question:** If the Dao resides in namelessness, then it does not encompass forms and vessels—how can it be deemed supreme?

**Answer:** It is precisely because it is without form or name that it can generate their forms and names. Thus we know that the classes of forms and names are all rooted in this Dao.

**Question:** If each thing *is* the Dao, and each is self-sufficient, why is cultivation and progress necessary?

**Answer:** The essence is not "each," but things are "each"—thus cultivation and learning are required.

**Question:** When we say "nameless is the Dao," does one attain the essence when in the state of namelessness?

**Answer:** Neither does the absence of namelessness attain the essence, nor does the absence of naming attain it; neither does the presence of being and non-being attain it, nor does the absence of being and non-being attain it. Neither residing in these four nor departing from them—only then can it be attained.

**Question:** If none of the four can be attained, and all paths of praise and reverence are severed, then ultimately nothing is accomplished.

**Answer:** Ultimately, nothing is attained. All talk of "attainment" is but a term opposed to loss. What is attained in opposition to loss—how can that be called attainment? Only when the four are unattainable can one speak of attainment. Attainment of the unattainable is no attainment; attaining no attainment, yet not departing from the four attainments.

**On the Essence of the Dao:**
The essence of the Dao is vast and all-pervading, its meaning present in all things. Because it is present in all things, it is wondrously beyond form and name, its essence encompassing the ten thousand things. The principles of the ten thousand things culminate in sameness and difference; the principles of sameness and difference culminate in neither sameness nor difference. From the perspective of sameness and difference, it is wondrously beyond and all-pervading. From the perspective of neither sameness nor difference, within its all-pervading essence lies its wondrous transcendence, and within its wondrous transcendence lies its all-pervading essence. Utterly wondrous and perfectly pervading—thus it is named the Dao.

**Question:** If you speak of its all-pervading essence, why call it wondrously transcendent? If it is wondrously transcendent and separate from things, how can it be all-pervading?

**Answer:** From differentiation to unity, from unity to the ultimate—when the ultimate returns to the source, sameness is not an obscure merging, nor is difference a distinct separation. How do we know this? Distinguishing the one through difference, it is not an obscure merging; distinguishing difference through the one, it is not a distinct separation.

**Question:** Are the two ends of sameness and difference mutually arising, or are they fundamentally distinct in root and branch?

**Answer:** Distinguishing difference through sameness, there is no sameness that is not difference. Distinguishing sameness through difference, there is no difference that is not sameness.

**Question:** Does the essence possess sameness and difference, hence we speak of sameness and difference? Or does the essence lack sameness and difference, yet sameness and difference themselves speak of sameness and difference?

**Answer:** To clarify the essence of the supreme Dao, which is wondrously beyond sameness and difference, we borrow sameness to gather difference and rely on difference to illuminate sameness. Relying on sameness to illuminate difference does not mean grasping sameness; borrowing difference to manifest sameness does not mean residing in difference. Forgetting sameness and relinquishing difference, yet not departing from sameness and difference—the profound convergence of this principle is thereby revealed.

**Question:** You speak of wondrous transcendence and all-pervading essence, yet it has never been without correspondence to the ten thousand things. If it corresponds with things, this is a surplus dharma—how can it be deemed wondrous?

**Counter-question:** What is called supreme must take non-correspondence with things as its wondrousness. May I inquire into this principle?

**Answer:** Corresponding with things ultimately burdens things.

**Question:** Then what is spoken of as wondrous—with what does it correspond to be called wondrous?

**Answer:** Correspondence corresponds of itself; speaking speaks of itself—thus we know that speaking has nothing to speak of.

**Question:** If you say it does not correspond with things yet speaks of quiescence, is this knowing quiescence and speaking of quiescence, or not knowing quiescence yet speaking of quiescence?

**Answer:** Knowing quiescence and speaking of quiescence.

**Question:** If knowledge resides within quiescence, it cannot be called quiescence. If knowledge resides outside quiescence, knowledge does not pertain to quiescence. How can one know quiescence and speak of quiescence?

**Answer:** Quiescence is quiescence without anything to be quiescent; knowledge is knowledge without anything to be known. The meaning can be understood.

**Further Question:** Is the Dao the same as or different from things?

**Answer:** Constantly the same, constantly different.

**Question:** Generally, what is the same cannot be different; what is different cannot be called the same. How can it be constantly the same and constantly different?

**Answer:** From the perspective of things' differentiation, the Dao and things are constantly different. From the perspective of their true essence, things are the Dao, and the Dao is things.

**Question:** If things are the Dao, does the Dao have life and death or not?

**Answer:** It both has and does not have life and death. The reason is this: from the perspective of its essence gathering things, things are the Dao. Things have life and death, so the Dao also has life and death. The treatise states: *"With things, it shares principle—ebbing and flowing, fullness and emptiness, ending and then beginning again."* It also states: *"Now this spirit and brightness, with those hundred transformations, with things dies and lives—square and round, none know their root."* As for good and evil, life and death—it is like fish born from water and dying in water. Life and death pertain to the fish, yet the water undergoes no change. Another explanation: from the perspective of differentiation, there is life and death; from the perspective of the Dao's total gathering, there is no life and death.

Names assign life and death to things—what loss does the Dao incur? Thus the Dao has no life and death. The treatise states: *"The Dao has no end or beginning; things have life and death."*

Someone asks: If the Dao has no end or beginning while things have life and death, then in the ceaseless flux and turning of the myriad things, is it things that turn, or is it the Dao that turns?
The answer: Both are valid.
The teeming myriad things flow and turn, awaiting their counterparts and undergoing transformation—this is called "things turning." The changes in things' movement arise from emotional barriers; by distinguishing through barriers, things do not turn beyond themselves—hence it is called "substance." Yet turning does not exceed substance; substance itself becomes turning—thus it is called "substance-turning."

Someone asks: If substance follows things in turning, how can it still be called substance?
The answer: In terms of events, substance follows the movement of things. But if one penetrates barriers and forgets distinctions, turning and quiescence fuse together. Once turning and quiescence fuse, the name "substance" also vanishes—where then does movement lodge?

Someone asks: The myriad things originally come from the Dao, their root deriving from the Dao. Though the Dao's beginning is one, its end is manifold. Now, in this ceaseless flux—is it the Dao or not the Dao?
The answer: At the juncture of Dao and things, who can affirm this or deny that, who can deny this or affirm that? This is that, and that is this.

Someone asks: When it is this, there is no that; when it is that, there is no this. How can you say this is that and that is this?
The answer: If there were no that, why ask about this? To ask about this is already that; to discuss that is already this.

Someone asks: The myriad things originally come from the Dao—who causes them to be this or that?
The answer: Who causes them to be this or that? Who causes them not to be this or that? Speech of this and that arises spontaneously.

Someone asks: If this and that arise spontaneously, then all depends on me—what merit does the Dao have for me?
The answer: When you attain its source, it is called the Dao. Your attainment of merit is the Dao's merit.

Someone asks: If my attainment of its source is the Dao, then when I act virtuously, virtue is ascribed to the Dao; when I act wickedly, wickedness is ascribed to the Dao—is that not so?
The answer: Ascribing virtue to the Dao, you attain virtue yourself. Ascribing wickedness to the Dao, you attain wickedness yourself. If you can claim wickedness for yourself, how could the Dao oppose you? The scripture states: *"Those who align with the Dao, the Dao also attains; those who align with loss, loss also attains."*

Someone asks: If things are the Dao, what connection does ascribing wickedness have to me? Why say I claim wickedness for myself?
The answer: You are the Dao. Claiming wickedness is the Dao's household wickedness—is this not claiming wickedness for yourself?

Someone asks: If I am the Dao, why say I can claim wickedness for myself? How could the Dao oppose itself?
The answer: You claim wickedness for yourself, thus ascribing wickedness to the Dao. The Dao is you—how could it oppose itself?

Someone asks: Since this and that arise from me, why should I study the Dao to eliminate this and that?
The answer: To study the Dao is to study yourself.

Someone asks: If I study myself, why do I habitually claim wickedness?
The answer: Excellent—now you can be spoken with. If you know that virtue arises from yourself, then wickedness cannot be done. If you know that wickedness arises from yourself, then virtue cannot be clung to. Advancing, there is no toil in clinging to virtue; retreating, there is no anxiety in doing wickedness. Virtue and wickedness return to spontaneity without attachment—is this not the Dao? Why abandon wickedness and cultivate virtue, demarcating good and evil, generating cycles of turning, exhausting yourself in labor, galloping all your life without seeing accomplishment? Some say this is good.

Someone asks: *"There is being, yet not being being"*—what kind of being is this? *"Not being being"*—what does not being not being mean?
The answer: There are three explanations of being.
First, in terms of quiescent substance: "being" refers to its wondrous being, the master of generation and completion. Thus the scripture states: *"Dark and dim, within it there is essence."* The treatise states: *"The Dao has sentiment and trust, non-action and formlessness."* "Not being" refers to not being the being of defiled accumulation and formed substance.
Second, in terms of blended substance: "being" refers to the being of its blended substance, while "not being" means there is no being beyond things.
Another explanation: "not being" means not being the being of a single thing.

Someone asks: What about *"There is not being, yet not not being"*?
The answer: There are two explanations.
First, in terms of quiescent substance: "not being" means there is no form or appearance to grasp, while "not not being" refers to the appearance of no appearance—unlike empty nothingness.
Second, in terms of blended substance: "not being" means there is no thing beyond things, while "not not being" means blending things as substance—thus it is called "not not being."

Someone asks: Can the Dao's substance be discussed in terms of having no color?
The answer: It cannot be discussed in terms of having color, nor in terms of having no color.
In terms of quiescence, form and appearance are both exhausted—thus it cannot be discussed as having color.
In terms of blended substance, its substance blends with the myriad things. Since things have color, and things are color, how can it be discussed as having no color?
Another explanation: The wondrous primordial qi manifests form and crosses the barrier—is this not color?

Someone asks: When it manifests as color, is this the same as things being color or not?
The answer: Same and not same.
The reason: In terms of being color, it can be said to be the same. Yet it is the color of no color—thus same and not same.

Someone asks: When you speak of manifesting color, is it because the substance has color that it manifests form, or because it has no color that it manifests form?
The answer: Both are valid.
If the substance has no color, its substance is empty and quiescent—how can it be said to have color? Thus it is called "no color."
If it has color, its substance is wondrously real—thus it has the color of wondrous reality.

Someone asks: If wondrous qi has no color but manifests color according to conditions, does this mean the wondrous qi itself becomes form, or is there a manifested form separate from the wondrous qi?
The answer: Both are valid.
In the exhaustive sense, form has no separate form—qi itself becomes form. For example, water accumulates to become ice; qi congeals to become form. How can there be ice separate from water? Thus it is said to be not different.

Not so: qi is named for its emptiness and quiescence, while form arises from obstruction and shape. When form stands on its own, it is not qi; when ice forms, it is not water—thus it is said to be different.

Someone asks: Ice forms from cold congealing, but from what does form arise?
The answer: Ice forms from cold congealing; form arises from conditions manifesting.

Someone asks: Ice forms from cold and disperses only when heated—what then dispels manifested form?
The answer: Water congeals from cold, and when cold departs, it disperses. Form arises from conditions, and when conditions vanish, it is dispelled. Thus it acts in response to conditions, and when conditions are forgotten, it ceases.

Someone asks: Is the principle of the Mysterious One something that can be spoken of, or is it something that cannot?
The answer: Both are valid.
The One is not originally one—oneness arises from speech. Now, wishing to unify differences, without the One nothing is gathered. Borrowing the One to gather differences, it is thus said to be speakable. Yet the One that gathers differences is originally without oneness. The oneness of the non-One exists because of differences; when differences vanish, the One has no place to reside. Thus there is no One to be one.

The treatise says: If it is called the One, how can it be said? If it is called the One, how can it not be spoken of?

Someone asks: When speaking of the One, is it distinguished in relation to things, or is it distinguished without relation to things?
The answer: Both are valid.
Distinguished in relation to things: names are established according to meaning and function. Distinguished without relation to things: the true substance is revealed in its own right. When names are spoken in contrast, the true substance is revealed, yet the name does not remain eternally one.

Someone asks: The One is not originally one—oneness arises from speech. Now, wishing to unify differences, without the One nothing is gathered, so the One is borrowed to gather differences. Yet when differences are dispelled, there is no One to be one. You also say that in contrast to names, the One reveals the true substance, yet the name does not remain eternally one. How can these two statements be reconciled from beginning to end?
The answer: The One refers to what has not yet been spoken, possessing unity. When the One is spoken, it is distinguished and revealed. Once distinction and revelation are dispelled, silent unity also vanishes. Speech and silence transform and dissolve—what One is there?

The treatise says: Beyond speech and silence, meaning reaches its limit. Though speech and silence cannot distinguish it, how can the One be absent?

Someone asks: Why is it said that the principle is eternally mysterious?
The answer: Where principle stands apart from the affairs of things, it is called "mysterious."

Someone asks: What is "mysterious and yet again mysterious"?
The answer: The first "mysterious" is named in contrast to what is apart, but it is not as wondrous as being mysterious without being named. The first "mysterious" is named in contrast to affairs; the latter "again mysterious" is eternally mysterious without contrast or distinction. Thus it is said: "mysterious and yet again mysterious."

Someone asks: When it is said to be mysterious without being named, by what is it distinguished?
The answer: It is distinguished through borrowed speech.

Someone asks: If it is said to be distinguished through borrowed speech, and speech is contrastive, why is it said to be mysterious without being named?
The answer: Previously, speech was spoken in contrast to reveal the mysterious. Now, borrowed speech speaks without contrast to distinguish the mysterious. Though it can be said that contrast is one and having contrast is two, thus "again mysterious" is different.

Someone asks: Can this "mysterious and yet again mysterious" be attained through cultivation?
The answer: The understanding of mysterious virtue has two kinds: one is the virtue of the mysterious body, and the other is the virtue of practicing the mysterious. The understanding of the virtue of the mysterious body also has two kinds: one is the virtue of the mysterious body, and the other is the virtue of practicing the mysterious.

The virtue of the mysterious body: the principle of the ultimate body is wondrously real yet imperceptible—thus it is called the virtue of the mysterious body.
The virtue of practicing the mysterious: when meritorious practice is complete and one wondrously accords with the mysterious Dao, entering through cultivation, it is called the virtue of practicing the mysterious.

Someone asks: When the virtue of the mysterious unites with the body, is it the ultimate virtue with or without practice?
The answer: Before attaining the virtue of the mysterious, there is the practice of dispelling both existence and non-existence. In the body’s practice, neither existence nor non-existence is taken—both are dissolved. This is called "dual forgetting."

Someone asks: What kind of practice in dual forgetting leads to the virtue of the mysterious?
The answer: The teachings of the body encompass both hidden and manifest meanings. Thus dual forgetting is the discourse that ceases affairs, while the virtue of the mysterious is the term that accords with reality. Teachings are not established in vain—one must forget what is attained. Before dual forgetting, meanings are distinguished in separation, and understandings may differ, thus there is taking and relinquishing. Afterward, in the revelation of unity, observing with fusion, understandings may become one with the body. Being one without distinction, there is neither taking nor relinquishing. The so-called practice is the practice of neither taking nor relinquishing.

The *Scripture of Wondrous Reality* says: "Without taking, right darkness naturally abides; without relinquishing, deviant darkness naturally departs." This is called "mysterious." Right darkness naturally abiding is called "virtue"—thus it is called "mysterious virtue."

Someone asks: All practice must involve taking and relinquishing. If there is neither taking nor relinquishing, what constitutes practice?
The answer: In truth, there is no practice of taking and relinquishing. The practice of dual forgetting takes non-practice as practice, and non-action as action. Wondrously according with mysterious virtue—this is what is meant.

Someone asks: The Dao embraces emptiness and existence.
The answer: Its body is all-pervading—what thing does it not embrace?

Someone asks: Is it because of emptiness and existence that it is said to embrace emptiness and existence? Or is there a Dao beyond non-emptiness and non-existence that embraces emptiness and existence?
The answer: Both are valid.
This is according to the body’s all-pervading nature, not distinguished by the teachings’ proximity. The so-called teachings do not arise in vain—they arise necessarily in contrast to things. Since they contrast with things, and things are contrasted, the Dao is spoken of as residing in the realm of purity and ascent, while things are discussed as being in the realm of defilement and accumulation. Thus, beyond emptiness and existence, the meaning of embracing is revealed. As for the Dao of emptiness and existence: since it is said to be the body of the Dao, what thing is not the Dao? All things are the Dao. Since all things are the Dao, emptiness and existence clarify the meaning of embracing.

Someone asks: When the meaning of embracing is revealed beyond emptiness and existence, how is it that within emptiness and existence the meaning of embracing is revealed? Since it is said to be emptiness and existence, there are no other things—if it is these, how can it embrace?

The answer states: The Dao is neither emptiness nor existence, nor is it "not emptiness nor existence." The "not" negates the name, while the "not-not" affirms the reality of the body. The body, though ineffable, is called "embracing." It is like the four great elements forming the body—this body embraces the four great elements, yet cannot be said to be deficient. Thus, the body is not the possession of the four great elements, and so it is called "embracing."

Someone asks: When you speak of "not-not emptiness" and "not-not existence," does this exhaust the body?
The answer states: The reason for the six negations does not exhaust the body; how much less do "not-not emptiness" and "not-not existence"? Furthermore, it is said that beyond the six negations, it seems as though it were real, yet where there is no speech, the reason has not yet arrived. Thus, one reluctantly applies a limited name, though in truth it extends beyond all bounds. Therefore, it is said: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao."

Someone asks: What is the body of the constant Dao?
The answer states: It takes being and non-being, and "not being nor non-being," as its body.

Someone asks: If the Dao cannot be called non-being, and in non-being it cannot be called being, and since being and non-being are separate, who is their master? If it is not being, how can it be named as a body?
The answer states: Since it is called the constant Dao, how can it be spoken of? Yet how can it not be spoken of? Because it can be spoken of, its body is not being nor non-being. Because it cannot be spoken of, it may also be being and non-being.

Someone asks: If its body is not being nor non-being, then beyond being and non-being, principle itself has no body. If it may also be being and non-being, then being and non-being are distinct from one another—why then speak of a body? Moreover, if it takes "not being nor non-being" as its body, yet may also be being and non-being, then "not being nor non-being" belongs to that, while being and non-being belong to this. If each corresponds to its own, then the two meanings seek a body. If that is made into this, then one is used while the other is discarded. How can it be "not being nor non-being" yet also "being and non-being"? Upon hearing this answer, my confusion only deepens.

The answer states: What is there that the body of the Dao does not become? If we discuss it in terms of being rather than non-being, then being and non-being are fundamentally quiescent. If they are fundamentally quiescent, then what can lie beyond the body? If we rely on being and non-being, then in quiescence there is nothing that is not being, and in being there is nothing that is not quiescent. Being is the root, and quiescence is being and non-being. The Dharma fundamentally admits no questions; the two cannot be obtained. Quiescence and function both follow function, and abandonment cannot be sought. How can your doubts cause you to doubt even the body?

Someone asks: If you speak of being and non-being, how can it also be "not being nor non-being"?
The answer states: The sutra says: "Nameless, it is the origin of the myriad things; named, it is the mother of the myriad things." The *Nanhua* states: "The Dao cannot be said to be, nor can it be said not to be."

Someone asks: If it is being, it cannot be called non-being; if it is non-being, it cannot be called being. How can it take being and non-being as its body, yet also say its body is "not being nor non-being"?
The answer states: The Dao gives birth to and completes the hundred transformations. Heaven is quiescent and vast—it cannot be called non-being; quiescent and vast, it cannot be called being. Thus, it is also called "not being nor non-being." It is like a person taking the four limbs as their body; the Dao unifies the four meanings as its body. Why be confused?

Someone asks: If the body of the Dao is neither fixed as being nor non-being, then its name should also be unfixed. Why is it still called the Dao?
The answer states: Truly, these words are so. The name of the Dao is also unfixed. The sutra says: "I do not know its name; I style it the Dao, reluctantly calling it great." "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." How can it be fixed? As for what is fixed: even if being and non-being are unfixed, the Dao, by principle, is all-pervading, and so it may be said to be fixed.

Someone asks: If the body of the Dao is unfixed and its name is not constant, how can such an unfixed Dharma be studied?
The answer states: Because there is being, one may cultivate non-being to reach non-being. Furthermore, one dissolves "not being"—"not being" is not dissolved by relying on the name of the Dao to study the nameless. The nameless can dissolve all names. These four meanings: the unfixed body is this very self, and the unfixed name is this very appellation. Why say it cannot be studied? The questioner is most profound.

Someone asks: When the Dao is said to be all-pervading and unhindered, in what is this discussed?
The answer states: There are two kinds of explanation. The first is discussed in terms of separation to explain pervasion; the second is discussed in terms of the body to explain pervasion. In terms of separation, pervasion is spoken of to remove separation. In terms of the body, its body is constantly pervading, and so pervasion is spoken of.

Someone asks: Speaking of pervasion to remove separation may be accepted without doubt. But if the body is said to be separate, what does it pervade?
The answer states: This speaks of the body’s pervasion in terms of discourse. Precisely because the body is constantly pervading, it is constantly spoken of as pervading.

Someone asks: What is pervaded is spoken of in contrast to separation. If there is no separation to pervade, what is pervaded when you speak of the body’s pervasion?
The answer states: The principle of the body is constantly pervading, and it pervades even before it is discussed. It is like a mirror or water: though it does not reflect, its nature is inherently luminous. Or like fire: its body is constantly hot—how could it not be hot before it is discussed?

Someone asks: When the principle of the body is said to be constantly pervading, even before it is discussed, is this in contrast to separation, or not in contrast to separation?
The answer states: It is all in contrast to separation, though the contrast differs in manifestation. In terms of separation, separation is revealed through obstructed affairs. In terms of the body’s pervasion, it is constantly pervading even before separation. It is not that this pervasion begins now. Though the body is constantly pervading, if there were no separation in the past, who would recognize this pervasion? If not for separation, who would discuss this pervasion?

Someone asks: All that is being cannot become non-being, and non-being cannot become being. Heaven is most numinous, yet even when ranked among the four great elements, it cannot transform its form into earth. The Dao is the same. How can it alone transcend the limits of the four great elements?
The answer states: Though both are called the four great elements, heaven and earth have fixed forms and positions, and so they cannot transform. The Dao, with its pervading body, can be anywhere.

Someone asks: If you speak of its pervading body, does it encompass both principle and phenomena completely or not?
The answer states: It both encompasses and does not encompass.

Someone asks: How is it both encompassing and not encompassing?
The answer states: The ten thousand things, in all their multiplicity, are all the body of the Dao—this is encompassing. Yet things are constantly obstructed and separated, while the Dao is constantly pervading and empty—this is not encompassing.

Someone asks: If you take "encompassing" as its essence, that may be acceptable, but if you take "not encompassing" as its meaning, how can it still be considered its essence?
The answer states: Precisely because its essence is both encompassing and not encompassing, it can be grasped—grasped and not grasped—thus making its grasp all-encompassing.

Someone asks: If its grasp is all-encompassing, should obstruction then also be considered the essence of the Dao? Why is it always said that the Dao is pervading?
It is always said that its essence is pervading, yet this fails to recognize its all-encompassing grasp.
The answer states: To call pervading its essence is but to highlight one aspect of its all-encompassing body. In the ultimate sense, neither pervading nor obstruction can be fixed. If viewed from a partial perspective, only pervading exists, not obstruction; if obscured by emotion, only obstruction exists, not pervading. If both are taken together, then it is both pervading and obstructed; if nothing remains, then neither obstruction nor pervading exists. The Dao and things are mysteriously the same—both pervading and obstructed in meaning. When pervading is understood, it becomes the meaning of only obstruction without pervading. When ignorance arises, it becomes only pervading without obstruction. Partial illumination reveals the pervading essence of virtue, yet it cannot convey the meaning of absolute quiescence. In this way, principle is all-encompassing from beginning to end. Whether flowing with the current or against it, listening yields no sound; whether turbulent or serene, bearing it brings no weight. Its root is difficult to seek, yet it lies near in your heart. Its branches are easily seen, yet they are but a foot above. In empty reflection, all is encompassed; knowing the subtle workings, the spirit reigns. With desire and attachment comes ruin, and the more one reads, the more it becomes evident.

Someone asks: Daoists always argue that the Dao is pervading. In what context do they make this argument?
The answer states: They clarify pervading through its essence and teachings.

Someone asks: When you speak of its essence, does it encompass all things or not?
The answer states: Since it is called essence, it encompasses all things.

Someone asks: If its essence encompasses all things, then it should be called obstruction, yet why is it only said that pervading is its essence?
The answer states: When speaking of essence in terms of your grasp of teachings, only pervading is highlighted.

Someone asks: When you say that the essence of teachings clarifies pervading, does this mean the teachings themselves are the essence that clarifies pervading, or that the teachings, though not the essence, can still highlight the essence and clarify the meaning of pervading?
The answer states: Both are acceptable.

Someone asks: If teachings are not the essence, then the essence does not encompass all. If teachings are the essence, then the essence, when conceived in terms of pervading and obstruction, should also take both pervading and obstruction as its highlights. Why do teachings uniquely highlight pervading?
The answer states: When teachings are said to be not the essence, it means they do not depart from the essence—speaking of teachings is speaking of the essence. Thus, to say teachings are not the essence yet are the essence, and to partially clarify pervading, how can obstruction not be discussed? Yet within the same essence, there are two aspects of superiority and inferiority. To call obstruction wrong and pervading right is merely the meaning of teaching and practice.

Someone asks: Within the same essence, there are two aspects of superiority and inferiority. In the methods of teaching and learning, pervading is always considered right and obstruction wrong. Does this mean guiding people to abandon obstruction and embrace pervading?
The answer states: Abandoning the wrong and embracing the right is naturally embracing pervading.

Someone asks: If you say it encompasses all, then both pervading and obstruction are included. Why guide me to abandon obstruction and embrace only pervading?
The answer states: In terms of the essence itself, there is no cultivation to speak of—what is there to abandon? What is now called abandonment is discussed in terms of teachings.

Someone asks: When you say that in terms of the essence, the Dao is pervading, in what context is this argued?
The answer states: It is argued in terms of teachings.

Someone asks: When you clarify pervading in terms of teachings, are the teachings and pervading themselves the essence?
The answer states: When discussing pervading, only pervading exists without essence; when speaking of essence, only essence exists without pervading.

Someone asks: When you speak of pervading, it is in contrast to obstruction. Now, when you speak of obstruction, is it the essence or the teachings?
The answer states: Obstruction is neither essence nor teachings; it is merely discussed in terms of teachings.

Someone asks: If both pervading and obstruction are discussed in terms of teachings, why in teachings is only pervading valued? If pervading is uniquely valued, is obstruction not part of teachings?
The answer states: Both pervading and obstruction are part of teachings. What is discussed is not the teachings themselves—why would only obstruction not be part of them?

Someone asks: If neither pervading nor obstruction are teachings, why in teachings is only pervading uniquely valued?
The answer states: Precisely because teachings are not pervading, they can distinguish between pervading and obstruction. Within a single distinction, there is no lack of superiority and inferiority. How do we know this? Those who understand nature and awaken to principle find teachings manifest as pervading. Those who are deluded and cling to ignorance find teachings manifest as obstruction. The superiority and inferiority in the distinctions made by teachings—what doubt can there be?

Someone asks: As previously argued, when discussing essence, only essence exists without pervading; when speaking of pervading, only pervading exists without essence. Are pervading and obstruction within or outside the essence?
If outside, then the essence does not encompass all things. If inside, how can it be said that when pervading is spoken of, it is not the essence?
The answer states: Pervading and obstruction do not depart from the essence. When distinguishing them, pervading and obstruction are not the essence. When speaking of the essence, it does not depart from pervading and obstruction, yet the essence is not pervading and obstruction.

Someone asks: Earlier you said that when distinguishing the essence, it does not depart from pervading and obstruction, yet the essence is not pervading and obstruction. You also said that when distinguishing the essence, there is no pervading, and when speaking of pervading, there is no essence. Now you say that pervading and obstruction do not depart from the essence, yet when distinguishing them, pervading and obstruction are not the essence. Should pervading and obstruction then follow from the distinction of the essence? Why do you now say that when speaking of pervading, there is no essence, and when discussing the essence, there is no pervading?
The answer states: Only when pervading and essence are distinguished in meaning does the name "pervading" not depart from the essence. When truly clarifying their designations, the names and realities separate in meaning. The essence distinguishes both similarity and difference, thus it does not encompass all things.

Someone asks: Does the Dao generate things, or does it not generate things?
The answer states: It both generates and does not generate.

Someone asks: Within this "generating and not generating," how many aspects are there in its meaning?
The answer states: Within "generating and not generating," there are roughly three aspects.
First, function itself is meaning—meaning in function is both generating and not generating.
Second, the Dao does not generate through discernment and reception, yet through discernment and reception, it is obtained and pervades. Distinctions arise from the near, hence it is said the Dao generates. Without intention in discernment and reception, it does not generate.
Third, things generate themselves; there is no Dao that can generate them, hence the Dao does not generate.

Someone asks: In the principle of creation and transformation, there is generation. In the principle of the ten thousand things, is there superiority and inferiority or not?
The answer states: In the principle of creation and transformation, there is both superiority and inferiority, and there is neither superiority nor inferiority.

How is this understood? By grasping its singular nature, one may speak of there being neither superiority nor inferiority. Yet when considering what can be distinguished, one again speaks of there being superiority and inferiority.

Someone asks: If we set aside the principle of distinction and do not discuss it—now, when we inquire based on the principle of inherent nature, which is without distinction, how do things arise from this principle? How can we then speak of the generation of things as solely distinguishing superiority and inferiority?

The answer states: It is like human spittle—some is as large as dew, some as fine as mist. Without intention regarding size, large and small naturally appear.

Someone asks: If spittle has a nature that can be distinguished, then the principle must inherently possess superiority and inferiority. If spittle has no nature of large or small, then it has no nature of mist or dew, and the principle has no reality of superiority or inferiority.

The answer states: As previously mentioned, the two doctrines mutually affirm that nature both exists and does not exist—this should be understood. Now, when distinguishing what can be divided, nature then has superiority and inferiority. Before division, how can superiority and inferiority be distinguished? When discussing the absence of distinction, this refers to the state before differentiation. When speaking of its presence, this is shown through what can be divided. In reality, it is the undivided purity of singular meaning; in differentiation, the essence flows and transforms. These two principles are all-encompassing—what doubt can there be?

Someone asks: That nature both exists and does not exist is a principle that can be understood. Yet when considering the distinctions among things, I remain unenlightened. Though forms differ in size, each attains its principle—since attaining principle is eternally the same, can there be nobility and baseness?

The answer states: Nobility and baseness are spoken of in terms of nature; in terms of essence and unity, humans and things are invariably one. Thus, the *Nanhua Treatise* states: "Viewed through the Dao, there is neither noble nor base; viewed through things, each deems itself noble and others base." It also says: "Heaven and earth are born together with me; the ten thousand things and I are one."

Someone asks: In reality, it is the undivided purity of singular meaning; in differentiation, the essence has superiority and inferiority. The absence of distinction refers to its undivided state; its presence follows from its flowing transformation. Now, when you speak of the unity of essence between humans and things, yet humans and things both have distinctions—how can this unity be equal to the undifferentiated purity before change?

The answer states: When speaking of distinctions in terms of inherent nature before change, and distinguishing in terms of form and substance—if we speak of differentiation, then there is no essence that is not distinct; if we speak of essence, then humans and things undergo no change. How can there be something unchanging beyond humans and things? That which is not present in phenomena is not truly existent, yet what is not truly existent can still be revered as fundamental.

Someone asks: Viewed through the Dao, humans and things are eternally one; yet when considering their emotional separation, things have nobility and baseness. Within this emotional separation, is there truly nobility and baseness?

The answer states: When distinguishing within separation, there is nobility and baseness.

Someone asks: Since viewed through the Dao there is neither noble nor base, yet viewed through things each deems itself noble and others base—if things each deem themselves noble, why are humans considered noble?

The answer states: The statement that humans are noble is affirmed by the teachings of the scriptures, which are trustworthy and real.

Someone asks: Who can expound the scriptures and teachings?

The answer states: The sages expound them.

Someone asks: If the sages expound them, do they then deem themselves noble? If the sages are enlightened to their own nobility, what difference remains?

The answer states: That each deems itself noble and others base refers to those of the same kind. Though they may deem themselves noble, this does not prevent them from revering the sages. The scriptures say: "Abiding above, the people are not harmed—thus they are noble under heaven."

Someone asks: The natures and principles of things differ, so nobility and baseness can be known. But how do we determine that ordinary people are the most noble, and by what is this distinguished?

The answer states: All things under heaven are governed by humans—from this, we infer the nobility of humans. How is this known? Humans possess spiritual nature and discern good from evil. That there is no nobility or baseness is spoken by the sages. That humans are the most noble is taught for instruction. That each deems itself noble is for each to peacefully abide in delusion. Speaking of human nobility is to reveal the meaning of gradual cultivation. The teachings are clear and guiding—what is there they do not accomplish? Preserving and then removing, one first clarifies taking and discarding, following the capacity of beings without rigid attachment.

Someone asks: The burdens of sentient beings—from what do they arise, and by what are they extinguished?

The answer states: They arise from the Dao and are extinguished by the Dao. The reason is this: when the undifferentiated essence takes form, arising and ceasing do not depart from it. Now, let us illustrate this with an analogy—it can be understood. It is like a basin of water giving rise to water, which is then extinguished by water.

Someone asks: What is the purpose of arising, and why does it then cease?

The answer states: Transformation through dark change is called arising. Returning to the source through self-transformation is called ceasing.

Someone asks: If it arises without cause and then ceases, what benefit or advantage is there?

The answer states: Not knowing why it arises, not knowing why it ceases—without cause, it remains as it is. Thus, it is called spontaneous arising and ceasing.

Someone asks: Is the essence by which the Dao transforms things the same as or different from the natural causes and conditions?

The answer states: That which creates and transforms is the same as natural causes and conditions; natural causes and conditions are rooted in non-abiding. Taking the function of generating things is called creation and transformation. Transformation does not occur beyond creation—daily, it is natural. Self-transformation through near change is called causes and conditions. Differentiated, they are distinct; undifferentiated, they are the same. Why say this? The principle does not ascend all at once; affairs depend on provisional dependence. The master of provisional dependence takes causes and conditions as fundamental. When the conditions are fully enacted, they return to the natural—then the mind does not grasp externally, nor does it grasp itself. If it grasps externally, it forgets both external and self, and internally fuses into one.

Someone asks: When you speak of the essence being self, is this distinguishing the self outside the undifferentiated, distinguishing the self within the undifferentiated, or the self distinguishing itself?

The answer states: All are valid. If the deluded or those in partial observation perceive it, they cause strife and defilement to divide into two—thus they relegate the self to beyond things. If one attains the comprehensive observation, then the undifferentiated is taken as the essence, desiring to eliminate this dual division—thus it is called distinguishing the self within the undifferentiated. If one originally observes with equality, then the undifferentiated is without what can be undifferentiated—thus it is the self distinguishing itself.

Someone asks: If the self exists as self, how can it eliminate the undifferentiated?

If one removes the undifferentiated to speak of the self, then the self-as-self arises. When the mind holds to the self-as-self, how does it differ from holding to the undifferentiated?

The answer states: Because there was a question about the self, the answer was given in terms of the self-as-self. Had there been no question about the self, there would likewise be no self to be self.

Someone asks: If, because there was a question about the self, the answer was given in terms of the self-as-self, and had there been no question about the self, there would likewise be no self to be self—then by the same logic, if one may attain the Dao in this way, when asked about the undifferentiated, one answers in terms of the undifferentiated, and had there been no question about the undifferentiated, there would likewise be no undifferentiated to be undifferentiated. May one answer in this manner?

The answer states: All are valid.

Someone asks: If so, then what difference ultimately exists between the undifferentiated-and-self and the self-as-self? Why is the self-as-self said to be superior to the undifferentiated?

The answer states: The undifferentiated is established in contrast to the mechanism of differentiation. The one who attains the self transcends differentiation, and in illuminating the self’s transcendence of differentiation, it falls short of the undifferentiated—thus the self-as-self is superior.

Someone asks: When it is said that the undifferentiated is without what can be undifferentiated, is this comprehensive observation or not?

The answer states: It is comprehensive observation.

Someone asks: If the undifferentiated is without what can be undifferentiated and only then is called comprehensive observation, then if the undifferentiated is taken as the self, how can it still be called comprehensive observation?

The answer states: In comparative terms, comprehensive observation takes many forms. That the undifferentiated is called comprehensive observation is in contrast to the observation that relegates the self beyond things. Now, that the undifferentiated is without what can be undifferentiated and is called comprehensive observation—this is the comprehensive observation of ultimate truth.

Someone asks: Only when the undifferentiated is equal and without what can be undifferentiated is it truly called comprehensive observation. Is the undifferentiated that is not yet free of differentiation not comprehensive observation?

The answer states: It is and is not. What is called the undifferentiated, when viewed from the perspective of later emotional obstruction and differentiation, may be called comprehensive observation; but when viewed from the perspective of prior equality, it is not comprehensive observation.

Someone asks: If the undifferentiated observation, when viewed from the perspective of equality, is not comprehensive observation, does this mean it is emotional obstruction?

The answer states: If one adheres to the observation of equality, then the undifferentiated reverses into emotional obstruction. But if one distinguishes from the perspective of differentiated things, the undifferentiated may be called comprehensive observation.

Someone asks: If so, then emotional obstruction also has two aspects, and how can comprehensive observation be distinguished?

The answer states: Though emotional obstruction has two burdens, there is a distinction between coarse and fine. The two names of comprehensive observation do not hinder the difference between the undifferentiated and the self.

Someone asks: Since it is said that comprehensive observation is established through comparison, how is the comprehensive observation of equality revealed?

The answer states: It is revealed in contrast to the undifferentiated.

Someone asks: When comprehensive observation is established through comparison with the undifferentiated, it may be called comprehensive observation. But in the comprehensive observation of equality, differentiation and the undifferentiated are both forgotten—how can it still be called comprehensive observation?

The answer states: The two kinds of comprehensive observation are both revealed through contrast, hence the name comprehensive observation arises. Now, when speaking of the undifferentiated to eliminate differentiation, and speaking of equality to transcend the undifferentiated—once differentiation is dispelled, equality also ceases, and once equality ceases, there is likewise no comprehensive observation.

Someone asks: Differentiation forms the undifferentiated, and equality is as such—are these three meanings derived from the scriptures, or are they the Master’s own distinctions?

The answer states: Words are not idly set forth; they must accord with the correct canon. Differentiation is as the scripture says: “The myriad things in profusion.” The undifferentiated is as it says: “There is a thing undifferentiatedly formed.” Equality is as the treatise says: “An autumn hair is equal to Mount Tai, a tile shard is the same as gold and jade; heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.”

Someone asks: These three meanings are clearly found in the scriptures and treatises. But where in the scriptures does it say that once the undifferentiated and differentiation are both equal, they also cease to exist?

The answer states: The scripture says: “Looked at but not seen, listened to but not heard—formless and without action, this is the essence of the subtle and the imperceptible.” Silent and without form, the formless essence—how can it be grasped through equality?

Someone asks: Does the essence encompass both good and evil?

The answer states: The essence encompasses both good and evil, yet good and evil are not the principle.

Someone asks: If good and evil are equally encompassed by the essence, yet good and evil are not the principle, then why does the teaching enjoin cutting off evil and cultivating good?

The answer states: Though good and evil are equally encompassed by the essence, evil is not the principle and can obscure the principle, while good can polish the essence.

Someone asks: If evil is the evil within the essence, why does it alone obscure the principle?

The answer states: It is like a tree with a gall: the gall, though born from the tree, is not the tree, and when the timely rain comes... It is also like iron essence and grime: both are external to the mirror, yet iron essence brightens the mirror, while grime dulls its reflection. The essence encompasses both good and evil—this meaning is taken to its limit here. Moreover, within the realm of names and meanings, good and evil are relative. Since evil obscures the principle, the distinction between good and evil is self-evident.

Another explanation distinguishes two aspects of the meaning of the essence. The first: the essence encompasses good and evil, yet the essence is not good or evil. The second: the essence is itself the essence of good, and the two—good and evil—are not the essence. Afflictions arise from the essence, and suffering flows from its branches. Now, to suppress the suffering of the branches and return to the original truth: if the essence is said to be good and evil, this is to clarify that good and evil are without end, and the essence is eternally so. Speaking in terms of the Dao’s natural pervasiveness, there is neither an essence of good and evil, nor the suppression of suffering to return to truth. This is what is meant by “forgetting the snares and transcending the limits, merging into a single expanse.” The first: forgetting does not flow, but must rely on the essence. When the essence is taken in terms of speech, it is called emotional good and evil. Good and evil are constantly forgotten, thus the true and the false are eternally distinct.

Another explanation says: The scripture states, “To know the constant is called illumination; not knowing the constant is blind action that brings misfortune.” Now, the good and evil, right and wrong that arise in profusion—all are blind action. The essence of blind action is that when it exists, it does not exist, and when it does not exist, it is the essence—thus it is said to be “that by which.” For example, when delusion is in the mind, the eye sees floating hairs and wheels in the sky. When the delusion ceases, the mind is clear and sees the principle; the former floating hairs and wheels do not need to be dispelled but vanish on their own. Once delusion is leveled, afflictions do not need to be dispelled but the essence is revealed.

Someone asks: What is the essence of the Dao?

The answer states: Its essence is neither being nor non-being, yet also both being and non-being.

Someone asks: Please explain.

The answer states: Neither being nor non-being—this is to illuminate the absolute transcendence of the essence.

Thus the treatise states: The Dao cannot be "having," nor can it be "both having and not-having." Form responds as "having," while essence abides in quiescence as "not-having." Therefore, the scripture says: "The nameless is the origin of the myriad things; the named is the mother of the myriad things."

Someone asks: Is it "neither having nor not-having," or is it "both having and not-having"? Is "both having and not-having" situated in that, while "neither having nor not-having" resides in this?

The answer states: Precisely because it is "neither having nor not-having," it is "both having and not-having." And because it is "both having and not-having," it is "neither having nor not-having."

Someone asks: Please explain.

The answer states: The essence is not two, yet it remains two. Thus "both having and not-having" is the non-duality of two. By clarifying the principle through names and meanings, the principle illuminates the essence. When the essence is complete and meaning reaches its extremity, it is called the essence.

Someone asks: Is the emptiness of an empty chamber and the solidity of obstructive matter the essence of the Dao, or not the essence of the Dao?

The answer states: It is both the essence and not the essence. According to the treatise, having and not-having are not distinct from the essence. Yet in terms of differentiation, principle and phenomena are eternally distinct. Emptiness and solidity, obstruction and non-obstruction, are phenomena, not principle—hence they are said to be "not the essence." The vast emptiness and the solidity of mountains and peaks do not depart from the essence of the Dao, yet they are still not the essence of the Dao. The essence of the Dao, in its having and not-having, is not having yet not non-having, and not not-having yet not non-not-having. The having and not-having of mountains and valleys are the domains of arising distinctions, the realms where beings wander—always having and not-having.

Someone asks: The chapter states that the great image has no form, no self-form, and takes the myriad things as its form. If this is so, can one say that the great image is provisionally the myriad things, while the real is not?

The answer states: This provisional and real possess a deeper inquiry into meaning, distinct from the provisional and real of mutual dependence.

Someone asks: If it is not the provisional of mutual dependence, how can there be another provisional and real?

The answer states: This provisional and real pertain to understanding. It may be said that the essence of the myriad things is originally undifferentiated. Within the undifferentiated, boundaries arise to form distinctions. Thus, one provisionally takes the undifferentiated as real to grasp the provisional things. When the provisional boundaries of things are removed, the undifferentiated real essence is restored. Another explanation states that the undifferentiated may also be provisionally established. When the provisional things are clearly defined, one sees that the original undifferentiated has no reality or non-reality—only the deluded sentiments of the multitude impose boundaries on principle. Thus, one provisionally uses the name of the undifferentiated to transform them. Therefore, the scripture says: "Provisional words borrow names, yet nothing can express their ultimate principle." It may also be said that the undifferentiated is provisionally established, while the provisional things are fundamentally deluded. The provisional delusion itself imposes boundaries to become real—hence it is called real.

The discourse on the essence of the Dao concludes.
