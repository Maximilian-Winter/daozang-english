### Preface to *Yichuan’s Clod-Pounding Collection*

The *Clod-Pounding Collection* is a compilation of poems in which Master Yichuan found his own joy. Yet it is not merely self-joy—it also delights in the times and in the self-contentment of the myriad things.

Master Yichuan said: Zixia once declared, “Poetry is the expression of one’s aspirations. What resides in the heart is *zhi* (aspiration); when spoken, it becomes poetry. When emotions stir within and take form in words, and sounds coalesce into patterns, we call this *yin* (music). Thus, to harbor the times is to call it *zhi*; to be moved by things is to call it *qing* (emotion). To give voice to *zhi* is to call it *yan* (speech); to elevate *qing* is to call it *sheng* (sound). When speech forms a composition, it is called poetry; when sound forms patterns, it is called music. Thereafter, by hearing one’s poetry and listening to one’s music, the *zhi* and *qing* of a person may be known.

Now, emotions are seven in number, but their essence lies in two: the self and the times. As for the self, it concerns the fortunes and misfortunes of the individual; as for the times, it concerns the prosperity or decline of the age. The fortunes and misfortunes of the self extend no further than poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness. The prosperity or decline of the times rests with the rise and fall, order and chaos of the realm.

Thus, when Confucius edited the *Book of Poetry*, he discarded nine-tenths of it. Of the over a thousand states of the feudal lords, only fifteen were selected for the *Airs*; of the twelve kings of the Western Zhou, only six were chosen for the *Odes*. This was because the Way of transmitting instruction lies in making clear what is good and what is evil, and only the most salient examples were preserved.

In recent times, poets, when afflicted by hardship, devote themselves to resentment and indignation; when favored with prosperity, they indulge in excess and dissipation. The fortunes and misfortunes of the self manifest in joy and anger; the prosperity or decline of the times arise from love and aversion. Rarely do they speak with the great righteousness of the world in mind. Thus, their poetry is largely submerged in personal predilections.

Alas! The drowning power of emotion is greater than that of water. The ancients said that water can bear a boat, but it can also capsize it. Whether it bears or capsizes depends on the water, not on the person. When it bears, it brings benefit; when it capsizes, it brings harm. Thus, benefit and harm lie with the person, not with the water. But does the bearing or capsizing determine a person’s benefit or harm, or do benefit and harm determine the bearing or capsizing? Between the two, there must be a proper course.

It is like a person treading water: it is the person who treads the water, not the water that treads the person. Yet even those praised for their skill in treading water have never escaped being harmed by it. If one treads water for external gain, then the nature of water follows the nature of the person. If one treads water for internal gain, then the peril of ruin stands immediately before them. In such cases, what need is there to distinguish between person and water? The injury to one’s nature and the harm to one’s life are one and the same.

Nature is the embodiment of the Dao. If nature is injured, the Dao follows. The heart is the outer enclosure of nature. If the heart is injured, nature follows. The body is the dwelling of the heart. If the body is injured, the heart follows. Things are the vessels of the body. If things are injured, the body follows.

Thus, to observe nature through the Dao, the heart through nature, the body through the heart, and things through the body—this is governance. Yet even so, one has not escaped harm. It is better to observe the Dao through the Dao, nature through nature, the heart through the heart, the body through the body, and things through things. Then, even if one wished to inflict harm, how could it be achieved?

If this is so, then to observe the family through the family, the state through the state, and the world through the world—this principle may likewise be understood.

From my youth, I devoted myself to the teachings of the Confucians, believing that the joys of the human world scarcely amounted to one ten-thousandth of what they could be, while the joys of the *mingjiao* (teachings of names and rituals) were boundless. Moreover, the joys of observing things were also boundless. Though life and death, honor and disgrace battled before me, they never entered my heart—how were they different from the four seasons, wind and flowers, snow and moon, passing before one’s eyes?

Truly, this is the ability to observe things as things, so that neither harms the other. For in this state, the entanglements of emotion are entirely forgotten; the only thing not forgotten is poetry. Yet though it is said not to be forgotten, in truth, it is as if forgotten. Why? Because what I compose differs from what others compose.

My compositions know no bounds; their rhythms and meters are not [restricted]; love and aversion are not established. Thus, they do not seek fame or reputation, but respond like a mirror to a reflection, like a bell to a sound. Occasionally, in the leisure after cultivating the Dao, I observe the times in tranquility, reflect upon things in stillness, rouse my aspirations in accord with the times, lodge words in things, give voice to aspirations in song, form poetry from words, give sound to song, and create music from poetry.

Thus, though there is sorrow, it never wounds; though there is joy, it never indulges. Though it is said to chant and sing of emotions and nature, how could it ever burden nature and emotion?

Bells and drums are music; jade and silk are ritual. To be addicted to bells, drums, jade, and silk—such words cannot avoid being vulgar. Yet to abolish bells, drums, jade, and silk—what then becomes of ritual and music?

Some say that the Way of the *Airs* and *Odes* flourished in antiquity but not in the present—this is hardly a comprehensive view. It is the speech of those constrained by their own circumstances.

Alas! Do they not consider that those who do good in the world are few, while those who harm the good are many; that those who create peril are numerous, while those who uphold peril are few? When a man of aspiration dwells in the fields, he speaks of the fields. Thus, his poetry is named the *Yichuan Clod-Pounding Collection*.

Written on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the *bingwu* year of the *Zhiping* era of the Song Dynasty.

**The Great Chant on Watching Chess**

Some men excel in refined arts;
I once observed them play at chess.
Beyond the moves, I saw creation’s scheme,
Within each piece, the subtle shifts confess.

An endless thirst for triumph burns,
A will to lead that never turns.
Though seated face to face as host and guest,
They meet like strangers, savage and unblessed.

Wealth stirs the heart, its fire untamed,
Joy, wrath—each passion plainly named.
Life and death lie in their hands,
Gain and loss upon their lips command.

Harmony shatters like ice and flame,
No flute and pipe their discord tame.
No bond of friendship here is known,
No love between a wife and husband shown.

Pearls and jade from sleeves they draw,
Dragons, serpents writhe and gnaw.
Walls of bronze rise from the board,
Swords and halberds clash, the air is scored.

By day they summon ghosts and gods,
On level ground, the dragons plod.
Empty rivers roar with hail and thunder,
Land and sea see leviathans sunder.

Cold and heat in equal sway,
Light and dark alternate day.
Mountains, rivers gleam like jewels bright,
Stars and spheres align in cosmic sight.

Watching fortunes ebb and flow,
I startle at the paths of weal and woe.
High and low shift with ease,
Yet reversal’s grip none can appease.

Heart and deed stand sundered wide,
Gain and harm cannot abide.
Fold or spread—know the hour,
Take or leave—seize the power.

The cunning drown in their own deceit,
The trusting fall to blunt deceit.
Truth and falsehood twist and blend,
Name and substance meet their end.

Victory is loss’s root,
Fortune climbs on misfortune’s boot.
Heaven and Earth in strife engage,
Fire and Water turn the page.

Bows and arrows clash in might,
Words and taunts ignite the fight.
What game lacks win or loss?
What age escapes rise and toss?

What once was right may now be wrong,
What seems so strong may soon be gone.
Viewing past through present’s eye,
Not just Fu Xi’s age meets the sky.

Yao and Shun bowed in graceful yield,
Yet Four Fiends lurked in the field.
Tang and Wu took up the blade,
Two Elders’ reproach did not fade.

Though Gao Yao spoke with wisdom’s grace,
Yi Yin and Zhou’s counsel held their place.
Yet even then, the cure brought pain,
Mending bone while flesh was slain.

Benevolence fell to fame’s deceit,
Righteousness was crushed by gain’s deceit.
Order, chaos—none stand still,
Change and reform bend to time’s will.

Favor the worthy, not the son,
Yet flaw and folly still are spun.
Favor the son, not the wise,
And scions bear the wounds’ device.

Some, like Miao, defied command,
Some, like Youhu, barred the land.
Yi stirred the strife’s first spark,
Guan and Cai spread doubt’s dark mark.

The Shang marched on Ge’s domain,
The Zhou struck Li’s domain.
At Mingtiao, banners flew,
At Muye, standards fell anew.

The sun that lit Xia’s prison bright
Once shone on Sheng’s flight.
Who knows if moonlight’s gentle ray,
On Mengshi’s path did not hold sway?

King Li fled to Zhi,
King You died at Li.
King Ping moved to Luo,
King Nan fell at Yi.

Some pledged at Shaoling’s plain,
Some met at Huangchi’s main.
Some fought at Chang’an’s shore,
Some slew at Ganxi’s door.

Some entered Yan and Ying,
Some fled to Kuaiji’s ring.
Some razed Daliang’s pride,
Some stormed Linzi’s side.

Five Hegemons devoured all,
Seven States lashed with scornful maul.
Cruel Qin crushed the Six Lands,
Chu and Han clashed for command.

Heaven ends where the sun still gleams,
Earth fades where no bound remains.
Far and near, all is embraced,
Length and breadth, all is traced.

Fields in grids once stretched wide,
Armor piled in endless tide.
Then came roads to cleave the land,
Borders drawn with ruthless hand.

Weapons melted, sharp and keen,
Books and poems burned unseen.
Lords dismissed, prefects installed,
Trunk strengthened, branches maimed and galled.

Heavy troops garrisoned Shang,
The Great Wall choked the frontier’s song.
They boasted of their rock-like might,
A reign to last through endless night.

Yet with a flick of fate’s own hand,
They ceded land where they did stand.
Viewed men as ants in scornful gaze,
Spent wealth like sand in reckless haze.

E’pang Palace stood unfinished still,
The First Emperor’s cart reached Xi.
Before the tomb’s last stone was laid,
Chen She’s troops rose from Qi’s glade.

At Ba Shang, hearts ran deep,
At Hong Gate, tempers seethe.
Xianyang’s smoke rose to the sky,
Nanzheng’s flames burned on high.

Men and ghosts in chaos twined,
Wind and clouds in sorrow joined.
Xiang’s might, Liu’s strength yet vied,
Who would claim the deer denied?

Three Chapters’ law stood fast,
Five States’ troops followed at last.
Temple schemes weighed deep and wise,
Tent-bound plans won swift surprise.

At Guangwu, rage burned bright,
At Honggou, beasts fought in fright.
Xingyang mourned Ji Xin’s ruse,
Gaixia bid Yu Ji adieu.

Three Heroes’ talents then took flight,
A thousand years shone with new light.
Old rivers kept their storied grace,
New sun and moon lit heaven’s face.

Three Systems’ calendar aligned,
Chariots and script in one design.
No lands were sundered, far or wide,
The distant held in bonds of pride.

Yet royal kin vied for the throne,
Armies split to North and South alone.
Had no great ministers stood tall,
Who then could save the empire’s fall?

A century passed in fleeting sun,
Long wars shook the vaulted one.
Who knew the witchcraft’s dark design,
Would rise from Liu Qu’s tangled line?

The steward held the scales with care,
Bright and clear, he met despair.
Seeing peril, he gave his life,
No shame to the orphan’s strife.

Bandits mocked the orphan’s plight,
Acting like fox and raccoon in night.
Palace halls saw widows weep,
Throne rooms chased the infant deep.

Dragon wars—where did they lead?
Ice stood firm in time of need.
Though the dike may break and flood,
Who dares forget the dike’s true good?

Eastern Han saw dawn’s last glow,
At Kunyang, tiles flew in the blow.
Wang Mang’s ghost in sorrow sighed,
On Jiantai’s steps, corpses piled.

At Hao, they chased the high-nosed king,
At Xin’an, Red Eyebrows’ sting.
Fire’s virtue ruled once more,
Han’s court restored its ancient lore.

Dou and Deng rose from the hearth,
Yan and Liang grasped the hen’s worth.
What use were Jing’s labors vast,
When Dong’s deeds left all aghast?

Yellow River ran with scarce a flame,
The capital choked with thistle and bramble.
Long skies saw crows take flight,
White bones drew no pity’s light.

Moats cried out to be refilled,
No blood left for the sheep to yield.
A great house nears its fall,
No single beam can prop it all.

Mengde struck first with daring hand,
Zhongmou rode his father’s land.
Xuande’s ambition met no end,
Yet tears were all he could expend.

Western Jin prized empty talk,
Great plans hung on rank and mark.
Women held the reins of state,
Kin turned to plague and hate.

Two Lords bore frost and dew,
Five Hu defiled the sacred vessel true.
No Guan Yiwu stood in sight,
Men longed for Xian Huan’s might.

On broad roads, Qiang dust swarms,
In the Central Plains, Hu horses scream.
Dragon’s light pierces Ox and Dipper,
Sun’s shadow sheds like a rainbow’s molt.

Clearing grass, they came to Luo’s bend,
Reclaiming fields, they rushed to Jiang’s shore.
Two hundred and four years passed,
Then chariots raced abreast in stride.

Eastern Jin split its southern tail,
At times yielding sacred lingzhi.
Five times the mandate changed hands,
Till Chen at last flourished under Sui.

Nations shattered in autumn’s dusk,
Cities lay waste with spring’s lush weeds.
The Yangtze stretched empty to the eye,
Travelers’ tears soaked their robes.

Later Wei opened its northern gate,
Xiaowen nearly stitched peace’s seams.
Yet Heyin soon saw upheaval,
The realm split east and west.

Erzhu rose with Gao’s might,
Yuwen wiped out Northern Qi.
When Sui at last merged with Chen,
The four seas became mere hedges.

The Bian Canal drained public and private stores,
Liao campaigns left soldiers weary.
Every body knew weariness,
Every mouth sighed in lament.

Everywhere, eras bore new names,
All longed for chaos to depart.
The Central Plains lacked a lord,
Who could discern deer from elk?

In times hard as "one in a thousand,"
Heaven and man set their tryst.
When dragons soar, clouds gather,
When tigers stride, winds keen.

The empress wielded the sun’s power,
Her kin held sway in the palace’s depths.
Alas for Huan Yanfan,
Who spared Wu Sansi’s life.

Xiuling’s hills rang with song and dance,
Yuyang’s drums and war drums stirred.
Could peace be scorned so lightly?
Yet blame fell on one Yang Guifei.

Sword Pavilion scraped the sky,
Tong Pass leaked tigers’ forms.
Both capitals fell to ruin,
The nine ancestral temples toppled.

Joy’s peak brings sorrow’s fall,
Favor’s bond breeds harm’s betrayal.
Matters left no recourse,
Who could compare such woe?

From then on, regional lords thrived,
No subjects showed their sovereign reverence.
Relying on merit, they shunned court,
Citing bandit suppression as pretext.

Each amassed mighty troops,
Who pitied the court’s decline?
They extorted the throne’s indulgence,
Watching the altars’ fate.

Seizing lands without royal decree,
Plundering to fatten themselves.
The imperial carriage fled in disarray,
Escorts faltered in disarray.

A tail too large knows no easy sway,
A whip too long cannot command.
Long-nurtured treachery brings certain woe,
Raising tigers courts lasting harm.

The nation’s steps grew ever more frail,
The lord’s heart filled with vain regret.
When fortune comes, flowers bloom bright,
When power wanes, leaves scatter wide.

Ten clans divided the Central Plains,
Five houses took turns on the thoroughfare.
Vainly bright stars still gleamed,
Yet dawn in the east had not broken.

Hardly had they returned to Changlu Garrison,
When they were driven to Huli Marsh.
Jiangxiao’s troops took what they sought,
Xuanwu’s fire burned in folly.

Surrender at Zhongdu was blameworthy,
Death at Lecheng was laughable.
Taiyuan’s court saw morning entrants,
Liu Zi heard evening wails.

Affairs bore layer upon layer of strife,
Human hearts shifted with each turn.
Cold ashes hid embers within,
Rotten bones still claimed turtle’s fame.

Deceit and cunning thrived in shadows,
Hardship and sorrow clung to the self.
To guard against harm, skin and flesh heal fast,
Yet saving the heart’s core comes too late.

Disaster strikes before one turns,
Words wound like gnawing at the navel.
To rise is to fall,
To near collapse is to be propped up.

Dizzied, all men revile,
In peace, all the world yearns.
Only by curing grave illness
Can one be called a good physician.

Long-neglected fields lie barren,
Treacherous paths are hard to tread.
Without a true lord’s emergence,
How can deeds be done?

House and state spun to their limits,
Lord and minister met but rarely.
Heaven lent its hand,
And our Song thus laid its foundation.

Wise plans adapted to each circumstance,
Heroes raised their heads in submission.
To this day, over a hundred years on,
People know not war or weapons.

Success and failure must bow to fate,
Rise and fall hinge on the times.
Heaven’s mechanisms shift without cease,
Master strategists vary their plays.

Past events are but faded traces,
Yet earlier records may serve as guides.
Compared to the game of weiqi,
They differ not by a hair’s breadth.

Waxing and waning follow heaven’s turn,
Yin and yang keep to the Dao’s bounds.
Fortune and misfortune shift with men,
Movement and stillness pivot on the hinge.

Those who rush will stumble first,
Late bloomers wither last.
Better to forget both harm and gain,
Than to suffer their exchange.

To catch fish, one needs a fish trap,
To snare rabbits, a snare.
Yet clinging to the catch,
One becomes a sheep in tiger’s guise.

The Dao is vast—hear Laozi’s words,
Talent is rare—hear Confucius’s.
To grasp form is to awaken,
How can one fear delusion in the game?

Black and white cannot be sullied,
Life and death are not to be sighed over.
Striking the mark like a shattered target,
The blade meets no resistance.

Do not marvel at others’ scorn,
Nor fear cold eyes’ scrutiny.
Having mastered wondrous use,
Why fret over many paths?

Following the Dao, the Dao is gained,
Aligning with heaven, heaven does not oppose.
Exhausting principle to fulfill nature,
Speaking freely to dispel words.

Gazing outward, one knows simplicity,
Listening to echoes, one discerns the rare.
Great broth needs no seasoning,
Dark wine cannot be diluted.

Supreme soldiers cannot be attacked,
Clever calendars cannot be calculated.
Wise words cannot be spoken,
Fleeting chariots cannot be pursued.

Brothers excel in love,
Father and son in kindness.
The realm may also be entrusted,
But this move must not be hoarded.

*To Guo Wen of Gong County, Written in the First Year of Huangyou*
Soft winds on Jade Creek bear drunken steeds,
Flowers bind Stone Grotto, song-boats sway.
Though near enough to see, immortal and mortal part,
I cannot join your third-month wanderings.

*On Presenting My New Residence to Palace Attendant Liu Junyu*
South of Lǚdao Lane, bamboo paths stretch long,
Green willows shade waters that part and flow.
All the worthy have bought scenes of serene heart,
I alone dwell here to nurture autumn’s resolve.

Compared to Chen’s gate, I’ve overstepped,
Yet beside Yan’s alley, I may still fret.
Though winds and rains rage without cause,
I trust they cannot overwhelm Shen Yin’s reclusion.

*Sent to Prefect Han Zihua of the Three Cities*
Luoyang has been a capital
For over two thousand years.
Each step treads through maps and records,
Each glance spans past and present.

Northwest, palaces stand tall,
Southeast, mountains and rivers lean.
The Yi and Luo rivers mirror men’s clarity,
Before the gates, Song and Shaoshi loom cold.

The finest waters and bamboos lie
South of Lǚdao Lane.
Below stands the hermit’s chamber,
A single path leads to the wicker gate.

Weeds hide his dwelling,
Pigweed seasons his meals.
He serves his parents above, his wife and children below,
Thick or thin, as fate allows.

Though others cannot bear such cares,
He himself does not change his ease.

I perused histories and grasped the rise and fall of states,
Delved into classics to find their root and source.
A guest then said to me: "Why do you alone refuse to grasp the moment?
The pure court now employs talent,
The sagely lord seeks worthies in earnest.
Dao and virtue, benevolence and righteousness—
These are no mere empty words.
Merit and achievement prize timeliness;
Why not seek a fine office?
Above, you would eat the Son of Heaven’s salary,
Below, succor the remnant of the common folk.
On thoroughfares, you would raise grand mansions,
Beyond the city walls, broad fertile fields.
Crimson gates ablaze with gold and purple,
Green towers thick with pipes and strings.
In your outer stables, fat and noble steeds stand arrayed,
In your rear chambers, delicate beauties gather.
Entering, you sit in a lofty hall;
Exiting, you ride in a splendid carriage.
How resplendent your cap and sword,
How composed your bearing and ease.
You would discourse on the affairs of the realm,
In a vast assembly, your words would kindle bright mist.
None would dare lift their gaze to you,
All would hold their breath, awaiting your countenance.
This is what is called a true man—
His ambition may be seen and known.
Why then must you afflict yourself,
Your form and visage like a withered eel?
You trace the deeds of the ancients,
Gleaning from the volumes they left behind,
Yet before a single ditch of water you linger,
Enamored of a few stalks of bamboo.
This is what is called a common fellow—
What lofty integrity is there to aspire to?"

I dared reply to my guest:
"Affairs are not so easily explained.
It is not that I delight in ragged hemp,
Nor that my mouth loathes rare delicacies.
How could I not know the gourd’s worth,
Yet firmly decline to grasp the whip?
I fear only the sight of gaping jaws,
Dare I forget the adornment of garden and hill?
Deepest depths hold layered waves,
Loftiest heights hold layered peaks.
Tread them as level ground—
This is no hardship for men.
Poverty and low station are what men find bitter,
Wealth and honor are what men find shifting.
To dwell in them as though they were nothing—
This is truly what men find difficult.
Advancing, I follow my own Dao;
Retreating, I nurture my own wholeness.
Since I do not yet know how it would be in another’s place,
How could I not remain steadfast?
I dare say your counsel
Holds nothing I might adopt.

O, how splendid the jade!
Born in the hills of Jing.
Though He the Carver may have known its worth,
The state of Chu did not concur.
The Way’s rise and fall, its bending and stretching,
Advance and retreat, its timing and precedence—
If one does not follow this principle,
When the jade is shattered, whose fault is it?
If the Dao remains unfulfilled,
Its mandate lies with Heaven.

Of late, I wandered through the Three Cities,
Lingering still in hesitation.
The renowned ministers of this age
Deigned to extend me special courtesy.
Some, in the clear night, discoursed on the Dao;
Others, by the rear pond, set boats adrift.
For several evenings, gatherings of literature and wine—
Boundless was the joy.
Beyond the cold of the tenth month,
Before the myriad leaves under hoarfrost,
I returned to my walled dwelling,
To sleep drunk beneath the bamboo window in the bright sun.

I raise my gaze in thanks to the gentleman’s understanding,
And at his behest, compose this piece.

*Matching Rhymes with Zhang Yuanbo, Bureau Director, at the End of the Year in Jiayou 1*
At forty-six, I am old,
Ashamed to lack talent.
The last days of the year just turn auspicious,
The new spring again stirs the ashes.
Not only have I forgotten profit and salary,
But I have also cast off the body’s form.
White hairs already exceed half,
Time hurries on of its own accord.

*Thanking Prefect Wang Mixue of Yanzhou for His Gift of Wine*
A grand prefecture brings new wine,
A dense small garden blooms with fine flowers.
On what day shall I drink beneath the crimson trees,
Startled to find it ill-suited to a rustic’s home?

*Encountering Spring in the Small Garden*
A hundred flowers hide in the small reclusive garden,
Each following red and purple to sprout new buds.
The Lord of the East lends the power of yang’s warmth—
No less than the rich and noble houses of dukes and marquises.

*Matching Rhymes with the Two Young Ministers Zhang on White Chrysanthemums*
Pale and pure, dawn congeals frost,
Fitting to follow autumn’s close.
Knowing myself to be pure and white,
Who pities my solitary fragrance?
Not that jade lacks luster,
But rather startled that snow bears scent.
White blossoms float in jade liquid,
One hue blends with the jeweled cups.

*On the Birth of My Son in Jiayou 2*
Now at forty-five years of age,
I have only just become a father.
Nurturing and teaching are truly my duty,
But whether you live long or die young, whether wise or foolish, rests with you.
If I live to seventy,
I will see you at twenty-five before my eyes.
I wish for you to become a great worthy—
I know not whether Heaven will consent.

*Four Idle Chants*
1.
All my life like an official,
I have followed my lot amid wind and waves.
What is lost knows no limit,
What is gained—how much can it be?
Since I have strayed from concerns of governing the world,
I may yet preserve Heaven’s harmony.
When there is wine in the cup,
I drink and sing again.

2.
At forty-five, I have just begun to know the path of fate.
Who would have thought Heaven would not cut me off,
That I would become a father only now?
I set aside zither and books,
Dare I hope for a grand household?
All things are thus—
Why trouble myself with needless worry and fear?

3.
Living in Luoyang for eight or nine years,
My heart has been troubled by only two or three things.
We meet, each with white hair,
Sitting together, much is said in pure discourse.
Human affairs have long been silently settled,
Worldly sentiments I have long known.
When wine is poured, do not press me—
Let me slowly reach the point of tipsy delight.

4.
I wish for the joy of a single gourd,
Yet I have not even two *qing* of fields.
My sincere devotion has not pierced the sun,
But white hairs already adorn my temples.
The clouds’ mood grows colder and more distant,
The pine’s heart grows older and firmer.
In recent years, I have grown ever more indolent,
Often recalling the old forests and springs.

*Matching Rhymes with Young Minister Zhang on Returning to Heyang*
Once I was a guest in the springtime of youth,
Today I return as a hoary old man.
Today and that day are already a lifetime apart—
How much rise and fall lies within?

*Eight Poems on Tall Bamboos*
1.
Over a hundred stalks of tall bamboo,
I know they were surely grown for me.
Suddenly, I find something gained,
Often I stroll idly around them.
I trust myself, yet perhaps I have not attained;
I know myself, yet perhaps I am not clear.
Secretly comparing myself to the ancients,
I cannot help but feel shame.

2.
Tall bamboos stand by the clear ditch,
The pavilion is small, yet also secluded.
Though the season belongs to summer,
The wind and dew already foretell autumn’s chill.
Moonlight emerges from the forest,
The sound of springs flows beneath the steps.
Who knows the feeling of this night?
Vast and distant, it cannot be gathered in.

3.
Tall bamboos are already lovely,
How much more so beneath the drooping willows?
The recluse has no carriages or caps of office,
Yet attaining this, he may well marvel.
Since I cannot stoop even an inch,
Why should I seal my sack in apology?
If Jia Yi had known this,
His bitter weeping would have ceased.

4.
Tall bamboos lean together in green,
Naturally emitting their lingering purity.
From time to time, a gentle breeze comes,
Ten thousand leaves sound as one.
The Dao, though sullied, attains the principle of leveling,
Things, though hollow, contain distant feeling.
Walking alongside my idle companion,
How clear and peaceful our thoughts.

5.
Tall bamboos like green banners,
Emerald willows like low-hanging canopies.

The recluse has his couch and carriage,
Day and night he faces them.
In the stillness of his dwelling, he feels his spirit open,
In the leisure of the scene, he delights in true communion.
Rather than lose my true nature,
How much better to follow what I love.
Tall bamboos mingle with towering parasols,
Startling the first signs of autumn’s season.
The evening cool is especially delightful,
Old scrolls are fit to unfurl.
Pavilions and ponds are wrapped in gentle breezes,
Gardens and groves linger in the late light.
If life holds such joy,
Why quibble over trifles?

Tall bamboos rise some ten feet high,
Still above the loftiest blossoms.
The brushwood gate stays shut by day,
Green and emerald face each other all the while.
Not only is the body at ease,
The heart, too, is level and vast.
To know the joy of idleness,
Is itself to rival lords and ministers.

Tall bamboos stay green through winter,
Only in the fourth month do they shed their leaves.
Sprouting like the stilling of weapons,
Shedding sheaths like the doffing of armor.
Their slender stillness is truly lovely,
Circling them, one loses count of the turns.
Alas, the common grasses and trees,
Waste their time beneath hoe and spade.

**Drinking in Autumn at the Song Garden in Zhengzhou, Presented to Zhou Zhengshu, Registrar of Guancheng**

Two capitals stand four hundred li apart,
Between them lies a famed garden, the Song family’s domain.
Ancient trees pierce the sky like swords and halberds,
Long vines trail to earth like coiling dragons and serpents.
I arrive on a day late in autumn’s close,
You set the feast before me beneath twilight blossoms.
The rain has passed, the bamboo pavilion still damp as we part,
At dawn’s return, crows rise from the road home.

**Revisiting Gongcheng and Baiyuan’s Old Residence on the Double Ninth**

In my homeland, the festive day arrives,
Yet climbing high, I find only sorrow.
Mountains and rivers lie beyond a dream,
Wind and moon span a decade’s span.
White hairs now streak my temples,
Yellow chrysanthemums twine the old fence.
My countrymen must laugh at me—
A man who brocades his robes, yet fails as a son.

---

**Passing Through Shaan in the Third Year of Jiayou**

What radiance did my ancestor’s Dao possess?
The *Two Nans* divided, bestowing one region.
He aided Zhou as Grand Protector,
Enfeoffed in Shaan to assist King Cheng.
Years stretch distant, boundless,
Mountains and rivers grow faint, vast.
Though his descendant proves unworthy,
Still I recall the sweet pear tree.

---

**Inscribed on the Yellow River**

Who says its benefits outweigh its harms?
I say its turbid flow has never cleared.
From Kunlun in the west to the sea in the east,
How many voices cry out in grievance?

---

**Passing Through Tong Pass**

Barriers tighten in times of disorder,
Yet stand idle in peace.
Though mountains and rivers form natural defenses,
Can virtue and power ever be contested?
Failing to fathom the thousand-in-one truth,
Its "hundred-and-two" fame rings hollow.
Distant lands long since ceased to be foreign—
Why still rely on the crowing of roosters?

---

**Inscribed on Mount Hua**

Among the Five Peaks within the realm,
The state reveres their seasonal rites.
Mount Hua stands as one,
A mighty guardian of the western frontier.
The Tang called it the Golden Heavenly King,
Now it is sealed as the Compliant Sage Emperor.
Alas! Such a spirit,
Usurps the place of heaven and earth.

---

**Staying at the Huaqing Palace**

In the sixth year of Tianbao’s reign,
A palace was built by the warm springs.
The Radiant Emperor and his consort
Came here yearly thereafter.
Purple pavilions wrapped in cool winds,
Towering peaks beneath the bright moon.
Yet why do the twin stone urns
Still trickle fragrant streams?

---

**Ascending the Chaoyuan Pavilion**

Embroidered Ridge rises in layered peaks,
Nineteen winding turns climb steep and high.
After a light rain, all is mist,
Emerging faintly from the clouds.
The golden carriage’s past is distant,
The jade statue’s traces remain, broken.
Even now, by the Wei River’s banks,
The sight of Chang’an endures.

---

**Composed on the Road to Chang’an**

Why weep on the road to Chang’an?
The ancients traveled it, as do men today.
Unheeding of cold or heat, dawn or dusk,
Wheels and hooves clatter endlessly.
This land, too, knows hardship—
Rain turns to mud, wind to dust.
Mud and dust shift without number,
In great storms, none dare venture out.

---

**Inscribed at the Temple of the Marquis of Liu**

Toppling Xiang, enthroning Liu—easy as turning a hand,
Ending Qin, restoring Han—like resetting a board.
He rolled and unfurled the realm with a day’s planning,
Forged his heart’s source in grain-abstaining seclusion.
All Yellow Stone’s teachings were put to use,
Yet what need had he for Red Pine’s company?
For talent and achievement like his,
None through the ages can compare.

---

**Ten Poems Inscribed at the Temple of the Marquis of Huaiyin**

**I**
A single man’s rebellion deserved execution,
The slaughter of three clans seemed merciless.
The Han’s Dao then was half-hegemonic,
Xiao He’s kingly counsel lacked true honor.
To establish such great merit was no folly,
Yet craving a princedom reeked of greed.
Four hundred years of Han’s flame were secured,
Only to be slain once peace was won.

**II**
Having found a true lord in life,
Why feign kingship to accomplish deeds?
Who says misfortune began here?
One should not turn to resent the High Emperor.

**III**
For a time, Han Xin was a loyal hound,
For ages, Xiao He a hegemonic minister.
Both transgressed the bounds of proper conduct,
Yet their crimes fell short of such a man.

**IV**
Han Xin never rebelled against Liu,
Yet Xiao He’s suspicions of Han ran deep.
Had he heeded Kuai Tong’s words then,
The High Ancestor’s fame might have been undone.

**V**
Though endowed with talent and wisdom,
His survival and retreat were not sincere.
The Five Lakes’ misty waves remain,
Yet none follow Fan Li’s footsteps.

**VI**
Had Han Xin not existed, Xiang could not have been destroyed,
Without Xiao He, Han could not have been restrained.
Know this: the realm cannot be ruled single-handedly—
Without the High Ancestor, Xiao would have struggled.

**VII**
The Han’s foundation was laid by debating merit,
Five men of other surnames were enfeoffed as kings.
None matched the might of Huaiyin,
Who dared to root out the Qin’s resurgence.

**VIII**
Han Xin relied on merit, foresaw little,
The Han emperor owed him virtue yet clung to power.
To imprison and execute him was no great feat,
Yet such cruelty was needless.

**IX**
If glory is seized violently, so too is humiliation,
After much joy, sorrow must follow.
Had he relinquished his princedom after success,
He would have remained a lord for generations.

---

**Inscribed on the Prefectural Tower of Fengzhou**

Willows trail green sashes,
Their leaves stirred like flying canopies.
The perilous tower’s thoughts are endless,
All day I face it in idle repose.
Crows depart, the grove empties,
Clouds drift, the mountains remain unobstructed.
My feelings follow the paired swallows home,
My intent meets the lone goose’s flight.
The evening bugle sounds, now faint, now clear,
Layered cliffs shift between light and shadow.
The setting sun hangs in sparse crimson,
Distant waters ripple with gentle currents.
The frontier’s gaze is thick with misty peaks,
The capital lies as if beyond the heavens.
Why does my heart, long a stranger,
Lean eastward, clinging to the railing in anguish?

---

**From Fengzhou Back to the Qinchuan Post Station, Sent to Vice-Prefects Xue and Yao**

Ninety days of joyous gathering,
Now turned to a dream at a glance.
The bright moon and clear river—
Once more, the eastern pavilion is beyond sharing.

---

**To Zhang Yuanbo of the Western Terrace, Who Sent a Poem in the Snow**

Snowflakes in Luoyang, large as hands,
No fire in the brazier, no wine in the cup.
At dawn’s first light, a knock at the door—
A poem from the Western Terrace, delivered through the snow.

---

**Seeing Off Zhang, Registrar of Yishi**

A thousand *li* of official travel in this world,
Two layers of parting from parents at home.
Remember now: the roc’s flight begins here,
The road ahead is perilous—seek favor wisely.

---

**New Year’s Chant, Fifth Year of Jiayou**

Qu Yuan knew his errors with age,
Confucius read the *Yi* through the years.
Human feelings end here,
But heaven’s intent is not in vain.
Affairs weary me more each day,
Yet my longing for the mountains grows ever firmer.
Who shares this resolve?
To grow old together by the Yi River.

---

**Five Spring Excursions**

**I**
Plum blossoms on the Five Ridges welcome the year’s end,
In the third river valley, the first month brings cold plum’s praise.
Ten thousand *li* apart, yet a month ahead—
Now I know spring’s colors come from the south.

**From the Five Spring Excursions (continued)**

**II**
Whose masterful tune flows from the Qiang flute?
All day, its pure fragrance lingers in the winecup.
I imagine the wanderer far from home,
Standing here too, lost in lingering steps.

**III**
The spring hues of Luoyang stretch boundless,
And east of the city, they grow yet more splendid.
A gentle breeze sways a thousand willows,
Soft ripples stir half the river’s blossoms.
In misty clarity, kingfishers glide over level banks;
In warming sun, mandarin ducks descend on shallow sands.
Long have I not seen the sovereign’s western journey—
Now travelers only sigh at their temples’ silvered frost.

**IV**
The second month blooms in full radiance,
Yet the imperial banners have not come—spring drifts unmoored.
Beneath green willows, I wander through every fragrant path;
Amid red apricots, I return half-drunk with wine.
A few fallen petals lure butterflies in chase;
A slanting sunbeam hears the orioles’ song.
With clear cups and wine, my aged parents rejoice—
Still, I may don motley robes and play before their steps.

**V**
The finest festival under heaven is Cold Food Day,
And the world’s most famed gardens lie in Luoyang.
Jingu’s warmth blends with palace halls’ emerald,
Bronze Camels gleam beneath silken radiance.
By the bridge, willows trail their slender threads to earth;
Beyond the flowers, swings rise halfway up the walls.
White horses tread lightly on grass like shears—
For over a decade, I’ve roamed here in delight.

**VI**
In the third month, peonies burst into full bloom,
And drumbeats rise wherever pavilions stand.
Laughing girls in carriages exchange banter;
Below the towers, crowds drift by at leisure.
Rippling jade-green waves sway the curtains,
While Shangyang’s floral breath fills the wine vessels.
This is the climate the Western Capital favors—
Yet now, who mourns the barren trees’ vain allure?

---

**Awakening in the Bamboo Courtyard**
Awakening in the bamboo courtyard, I recline on the armrest,
As the languid summer day stretches long.
Orioles just lead their fledglings, teaching tender tongues;
Apricots hang heavy, donning their pale gold.
Raindrops break the quiet dream in fragments,
While wind stirs distant thoughts into flight.
A small channel plays with water in dense green shade—
Looking back, I realize days have passed once more.

---

**Six Autumn Excursions**

**I**
In the seventh month, lotuses blaze in full bloom,
And I linger near the southeastern garden.
Sometimes the wind brushes the pond’s heart,
Bearing boundless fragrance from the water’s surface.
Mist-painted streams run deep—I wander lost;
The evening lake at Dongting has not yet brought me home.
Then, a sudden shower whispers past—
And fresh coolness arrives with my wine.

**II**
Before autumn, the vast clarity stirs in secret,
And Luoyi now knows the season’s balance.
Courtyards turn cool—people rejoice together;
Gardens, washed by rain, grow even clearer.
Turning the boat on Yi River, the breeze drifts gently;
Reining the horse at Tianjin Bridge, the moon shines bright.
The sages’ thoughts divide like Gao and Kui—
Let poetry and wine celebrate this peaceful age.

**III**
The eighth month’s light is not yet bleak,
And pine pavilions, bamboo groves suit it best.
Just as day and night find their pause,
The balance of heat and chill arrives in due time.
The bright moon enters my heart as if with intent;
A kindly breeze meets my face as if it knows me.
Idle folk sing and chant in contentment,
Unconcerned whether the court heeds their verse.

**IV**
My home lies south of the city by water and bamboo,
And autumn’s joys have never failed me.
I love the mild chill of this season,
While half-drunk, time slips by unnoticed.
Trusting my horse on the imperial avenue after light rain,
Leaning on the railing of a monk’s pavilion at dusk.
For ten years, I’ve chased every fair scene—
Now, I ask the wind to whiten my temples.

**V**
Though the ninth month’s splendor wanes,
The Central Plain’s beauty is not yet spent.
My eyes take in autumn’s hues for a thousand *li*;
My hands hold two or three branches of yellow blossoms.
Fine wine easily dissolves idle years,
But bronze mirrors need not reflect my aging face.
If I must make others believe,
Who would know the sincerity I’ve poured out?

**VI**
In frosty skies, endless thoughts arise—
I cannot bear the tower’s height, forcing my gaze.
Distant mountains fill my sight in vain;
The autumn palace stands empty and aloof.
Clouds stretch over far peaks, a thousand *xun* straight;
Sunset scatters crimson threads through the sky.
Countless sorrows cannot be spoken—
With whom can I open my heart to the west wind?

---

**An Autumn Day’s Occurrences**
Crows clamor in the daytime woods—
For whom do they toil so bitterly?
Crickets chirp through the nighttime courtyard—
For whom do they labor so ceaselessly?
Alas, how brief their lives,
Yet they never rest.
I ask: how long is this?
The two who forget speech and silence.

---

**On the Road to Mount Shang**
Ten lodgings bring me to Shangyan,
Though distant, the journey is not harsh.
East and west, I trace the Luo River,
Gazing at Qin’s mountains within and beyond.
Beyond the mist and rosy clouds, I am free—
Yet my heart remains with my parents.
The courtyard is not far—
I can set a date for my return.

---

**Matching Magistrate Zhang Zihou’s Early Plum Blossoms**
Only the Queen Mother of the West could craft such lightness,
Snipping the sky’s edge into scattered white clouds.
Endless pure fragrance and pristine beauty—
Even the fairest offerings at the winecup yield to you.

Plums shade the spring stream, water winds around the hills,
Plum blossoms dazzle as the brook murmurs.
In Nanzheng, the earth is warm, and they bloom early—
By the start of spring, they’ve already bloomed many times.

A thousand flowers vie in succession,
But if one speaks of lofty standards, only the plum remains.
I understand your intent in binding them—
You cherish their pure threads, letting them bloom first.

Frost upholds their noble bearing, lifting it high;
Wind carries their cold fragrance far and wide.
The prefect is moved, the traveler is touched—
Golden cups are drained in celebration.

---

**On the Road in Shang Mountains**
Fading embers, dim lamp, the night deepens,
As I silently ponder past affairs, wrapped in a cold quilt.
A frosty sky, a bright moon—though a thousand *li* apart,
It cannot compare to the inch of heart grieving for the times.

---

**Matching Prefect Song of Shang’s Early Plum Blossoms**
South of the mountains, the land is as warm as Lingnan,
And in the twelfth month, plum blossoms have already bloomed for days.
Unbending, they defy the common flowers’ ways,
Standing apart from the crowd, claiming spring’s first light.

From the horn, their notes drift, colder than bone;
From the flute, their melody enters the spirit.
A fair brow’s makeup fades, clinging to pale powder;
A painted beam’s warmth stirs light dust.
The magistrate cherishes their beauty, offering them to the prefect;
The prefect shares their fragrance even with rustics.
Holding a few branches, I inhale deeply—
How can I bear to let fine wine touch my lips?

---

**Matching a Friend’s Poem on Freeing the Heart**
Though one may not foresee the future,
Wealth and rank, fame and achievement—are they truly won by force?
To cleanse the heart, nothing serves like wine;
To roam in ease, nothing compares to poetry.
Here, amidst water, bamboo, clouds, and mountains,
How can I betray the seasons of wind, flowers, snow, and moon?
A man’s grand ambitions lie in action or retreat—
When, if not now, should I unknit my brows and smile?

---

**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower to View Snow**

**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower to View Snow**

At the western tower, the snow sharpens my gaze,
My body, step by step, seems encased in crystal.
A thousand flakes, ten thousand flakes, artfully adorn the earth,
Half-dancing, half-flying, they slant against the pillars.
Their form like jade shards—fragile yet scattered,
Their substance like willow catkins—even lighter still.
Who says the wanderer at the world’s edge is bound?
With wine before us, our hearts hold twofold feeling.

---

**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on the Western Tower After Snow Clears**

The great snow first clears as the sun dips low,
Why spare the climb? I ascend the high tower again.
A few peaks stand like swords unsheathed,
A single stream winds in fresh threads of ice.
The Kunlun’s heights, transplanted, are all jade,
The Milky Way, fallen, turns to silver.
The reclusive man regrets his lack of fine lines—
Yet the scene has never failed to favor men.

---

**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower as Snow Melts**

The last snow melts, the ice breaks open,
The wind and light gradually embrace the tower.
The traveler has not yet reached the sun’s edge,
But spring’s hues descend once more from heaven.
Moreover, the cup never lacks wine—
How can the ridge bear to be without plum blossoms?
Were it not for the prefect’s golden bond of friendship,
Who would deign to pour their heart out for this unworthy one?

---

**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Moonlit Snow After Clearing**

Snow fills the mountains, frost fills the courtyard,
A cold radiance, the moon grinds a single wheel of light.
The wanderer’s heart holds little joy in fleeting time,
Yet the night’s brilliance, vast and white, is all in vain.
Bamboo near the curtains scatters broken shadows,
Wind through the pavilions carries lingering clarity.
I regret having no fine verses to repay the splendid scene—
Alone and forlorn, even dreams refuse to come.

---

**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poem on Ascending the Tower After Snow Clears**

A hundred-foot tower stands in the wake of light snow,
At dusk, the idle gaze grows piercingly clear.
Mountains stretch through evening mist, rising then falling,
Water parts the sparse woods, faint yet bright.
At the sky’s edge, sunset glows in a thousand strands,
The wind carries the last notes of a distant horn.
This moment, this scene—truly fit for a painting,
Yet I fear the painter’s brush lacks such precision.

---

**New Year’s Eve on the Road**

**New Year’s Eve on the Road**

Countless moments stretch to the coming year—
Pour the fragrant wine again, let it flow.
The Dipper’s handle points to *chǒu*, the dark waning,
The year’s arrow strikes man, and spring returns once more.
No need for worldly cares to obstruct this hour,
For my heart’s tangle has long turned to ash.
Fleeting fame lies beyond the floating clouds—
Swift as a breath, time presses on.

---

**Matching Prefect of Shang’s Poyn on the Auspicious Year of Jiayou (1061)**

A weary frame in travel meets the new year,
Moved by a lifetime’s hair, so quick to fade.
The cup drained, my breast remains desolate,
Joy spent, my spirit sinks into ennui.
Gazing toward immortals, wind and moon shine clear,
Green blinds frame the night, so long and slow.
Facing this lifeless form, mere clay and wood,
I cannot but feel my soul dissolve.

---

**Matching Wang, Attendant of the Palace Secretariat, on Ascending the Prefecture Tower to View the Mountains**

Four worthies once lingered here,
A thousand years on, men still blush with shame.
A man of renown finds the world hard to escape,
While one with nothing in his breast idles in the hills.
Affairs, seen through rise and fall of ages,
Reveal the Dao in ruler and minister’s advance and retreat.
If you harbor rare talent, rare use will find you—
If not, you must bear a lifetime’s leisure.

---

**Four Poems on the Temple of the Four White-Haired Ones**

1.
Mighty Qin lost control, blood flowed wide,
The realm sought a lord, yet none could be found.
Just when heroes locked horns in contest,
Who knew into whose hands the deer would fall?

2.
The true man of Bashang had already soared,
The four looked at one another, speechless.
Xu said, “Heaven’s mandate has its course—
Better to follow the tracks of Chao and Xu.”

3.
The Han emperor’s pride could not bend them,
Only the crown prince’s humble words brought them forth.
Though aged, they still achieved great deeds—
To this day, their lofty virtue shines like sun and stars.

4.
Tian Heng fled to the sea and won renown,
Shang came to Chang’an, strong for a hundred *li*.
Only when the four were made to perfect their integrity
Did one know Gaozu was a true king.

---

**Thanking Prefect of Shang, Song Langzhong, for Sending a Household Register for Mount Tianzhu, Following the Original Rhyme**

A talisman from Shang flew here, fresh and new,
Fulfilling a bond beyond this life’s measure.
Most joyous, the purple lingzhi first in hand—
Tianzhu in the southwest stands neighbor to heaven.

My first intent was to serve at the emperor’s side,
But spring’s Dipper turned in the capital’s circuit.
Now to dwell beneath Tianzhu’s peak,
No fear of night travelers ahead.

I do not present life and death to the august throne,
But embrace mist and haze, learning reclusion.
Much thanks to Magistrate Shi for leaving the right seat vacant,
To welcome once more a mountain man to Tianzhu.

A cluster of mist and haze locks the drifting clouds,
Tianzhu’s lone height is fine for a true man’s perch.
From now on, I make plans for a western return—
Why seek further fords among men?

---

**Four Poems on Mount Tianzhu**

1.
Long have I roamed with the deer, achieving nothing,
Yet deep is the grace of Magistrate Shi, who enrolled me.
Through ten thousand ages, name and surname endure—
Bound to Tianzhu’s peaks, they too shall remain.

2.
No success, I’ve run with the herd of deer,
But your kindness runs deep, Magistrate, in granting me a register.
Through all time, name and fame persist—
Let them abide with Tianzhu’s towering summits.

---

**To Prefect of Shang, Song Langzhong**

Returning first to Luoyang, endless affairs await,
A man of leisure, my place seems at odds.
Now, at last, I feel ease and freedom,
Like the carefree days on Shang’s slopes.

---

**Awakening from a Nap in the Small Garden**

Beyond the gate, it seems a deep mountain,
Nature’s truth, truly, can be regained.
Beyond the rush of caps and carriages,
Sun and moon pass in their course.
The garden’s waters flow with life,
Grasses and trees idle in the windless air.
Spring birds break my secluded dream,
Chattering on the branches, soft and sweet.

---

**Three Poems on Wandering the Mountains**

1.
Long confined in the city’s gates, my heart grows weary,
The moment I step beyond, my eyes brighten.
I’ve seen all the sights of Dragon Gate on the Yi,
Listened to the last echoes of the Luo’s waters at Nüji.
At Mount Tai’s shrine, the red sun rises,
From Heaven’s Altar, white clouds arise.
This body is already pledged to true companions—
Not for trifles will I weigh gain or loss.

2.
Spring’s end is the perfect time for climbing,
Human feeling and heaven’s mood both harmonize.
Boating on the Yi as the wind turns at night,
Fishing at the stream’s gate as the moon rises.
My carefree spirit soars, poetry runs wild,
My ailing frame relies on wine to sustain.
Few are the days of this floating life—
How can I bear to furrow my brow between them?

3.
Joy is pursued, sorrow shunned—
A true man knows fate.
Minor deeds and fame are hard to secure,
But clouds and mountains bring me delight.
Fear not the distant mist and haze,
While strength remains, ride it.
Beyond enough, what joy is there?
Wealth and honor, once past, bring only grief.

---

**Two-Colored Peach Blossoms**

Rouge and powder both enhance their beauty,
A dazzling charm to overthrow city and state.
I suspect they are twin sisters from the Jewel Bud Realm,
Both willing at once to wed the spring wind.

---

**Composing Poems While Climbing Mountains and Facing Waters**

Mountains have towering peaks, waters have waves,
Neither sandals nor boats can contain them.
Not that wisdom and kindness lack joy in this,
But few who climb and face them shirk the toil.
Words of taste know only sweet meats and roasts,
Who speaks truly can recognize jade and jasper?
I lament my failure to exhaust human talent—
Ever resenting how highly men judge today.

---

**Two Poems Thanking Grand Chancellor Fu for Summoning Me to Office**

1.
Your summons, much thanks, was not forgotten,
Thinking my breast held something to offer.
If I advanced, how could I bear official duties?
At leisure, why take a name in vain?
The messenger said, “If you do not wish to serve,
You may come and be granted a title of ease.”
I wish to be like Chao and Xu, calling myself a subject,
Content to grow old in the age of Yao and Shun.

2.
My eyes are full of worthy men in court ranks,
A sick man has no way to bind the realm’s fate.
I wish to fulfill my plan to grow old in leisure,
But heaven’s intent remains unknown.
How many layers of carriages and caps repay the body’s worth?
Better to have clouds and mountains fill my gaze.
Fine scenes never fail to inspire verse,
But my bold heart has all dissolved away.
The swan and wild goose know the joys of rivers and lakes—
Why trouble with petty nets and snares?

---

**Responding to a Question on the Teachings of Names**

Since the world’s beginning, teachings have spread,
Among them, the bold are called true Confucians.
Cultivating the self has its Dao—those who awaken first,
What age has lacked men who grasped its mysteries?
Radiant as cinnabar and ink, the meaning of classics and history,
Bright as sun and moon, the sage’s path.
Though I, a humble student, have long immersed myself,
How dare I slander the world’s heroic talent?

---

**Seeing Off Academician Wang Bochu on His Mission to the Northern Capital**

A man’s resolve is set when the coffin closes,
His grand designs weigh heavily.
The road ahead cannot be without nostalgia,
But in office, how can he bear to forget his feelings?
In leisure, speech must be precise,
Planning ahead ensures peace.
Yet the road ahead cannot be without nostalgia,
And in office, how can he bear to forget his feelings?

Who says there is no supreme strategy for governing the frontier?
To strike at the enemy’s plans—no troops are needed.

*End of Volume Two of Yi Chuan’s "Striking the Earth"*
*Yi Chuan Shao Yong Yaofu*

**Congratulating a Retiring Official**

Common sentiment mostly delights in holding office,
Yet how could a man of understanding ever be bound?
Surrendering the seal was never for scant salary,
Nor was hanging up the cap for advanced age.
Through things’ nature, he grasped the principles of rise and fall,
And so awakened to Heaven’s power in acceptance and rejection.
Fitting to release his cares amid pure scenes—
In his homeland, fine forests and springs await.

**Early Autumn**

Summer departs, yet heat lingers still,
After rain, coolness at last arrives.
Before the bridge, waters have long flowed,
Beyond the sky, thunder yet startles.
A curved armrest hides in quietude,
The crossbar gate opens in leisure.
All bold ambitions are now spent—
Why trouble the heart further?

**Written in Passing**

Laughable, yet also pitiable—
What, after all, is human life?
All ten thousand affairs
Should be gathered into a single song.
Worldly affairs shift faster than a palm’s turn,
Years pass swifter than rushing waves.
In stillness, the true qi’s savor—
What is gained is beyond measure.

**Injured Foot**

Misfortune comes from the unexpected,
Yet the harm was never deep.
Self-betraying the principles of nurturing life,
It brought parents sorrowful concern.
Suddenly, walking became difficult,
By chance, climbing was hindered.
A month passed before I could go out—
Hard to forget the admonition of *Lezheng*.

**Leisurely Stroll**

The garden lies desolate,
I chant verses circling the marsh’s edge.
Wind startles after the first autumn sacrifice,
Leaves fall before the frost arrives.
Withered grass frames the slanting sun,
Evening clouds prop up the distant sky.
When shall I perceive the true image?
Only by entering wordlessness.

**Morning Rising**

Mountains high, waters deep—
No remedy for the present.
Earth holds the affairs of a moment,
Heaven opens the heart of eternity.
Light mist veils the morning pavilion,
Fine rain scatters through green woods.
Though this scene is plain,
Where in the world can it be found?

**Moonlit Night**

Rain clears, the wind is fine,
Autumn’s touch, the sky not yet cold.
I move my bed beneath the steps,
Watching the moon rise from the forest’s edge.
Wine is here to share,
But no guests to join the joy.
When later I meet a true friend,
This scene will be hard to seek again.

**Basin Pond**

Three or five small lotuses,
A basin holds little water.
Though not a vast marsh,
Still, tiny waves arise.
Roughly evoking rivers and lakes,
Yet no mandarin ducks or egrets pass.
The recluse’s delight is hard to suppress—
Often pacing, drunk and chanting.

**Two Poems on Roaming the Mountains**

The Luo River has many fine peaks,
The Yi River many fine bamboos.
Each has its season for wandering,
Though frequent, the eye never tires.
Seeking purity is no breach of integrity,
Exploring the secluded is no disgrace.
Deer do no harm to men—
The heart harms no deer.

The Two Peaks have many fine summits,
The Three Rivers many fine clouds.
Gazing without weariness,
Harmonious qi subtly nurtures the spirit.
If a single thought stirs restlessly,
Ten thousand affairs follow in turmoil.
People say the value of idleness is great—
Become a man of idleness.

**Composed on the Road to Longmen**

The principles of things and human nature are clear,
Why fret over one’s life?
Expansion and contraction lie in my calculations,
Use and rejection follow the times, without fixed names.
All around, clouds and mountains are joy,
Not a speck of glory or disgrace need startle.
The gates of nobles are said to be deep as the sea—
For thirty years, I’ve strolled past with arms swinging.

**On Fame and Gain**

Fame and gain, in the end, are no joy,
Wind and waves ultimately offer little peace.
Slightly near to good repute—take little,
Only when close to pure delight—seek more.
Good repute, though abundant, must bring trouble,
Pure delight, though ample, brings no sorrow.
Does the world know this truth?
Yet in endless succession, they follow the overturned tracks.

**Thirty Years’ Chant**

Thirty years span a generation,
Within them, much to laugh and sigh over.
Heaven’s giving and taking never cease,
Human right and wrong never end.
Fortunate mandarin ducks—heads turn white early,
The cuckoo’s cry—blood flows first.
Know this: talent is the harm,
Yet when talent is gone, one still frets.

**Responding to a Man’s Unrestrained Words**

Long unseen—how have you fared?
New poems emerge with laughter and words anew.
Through things’ principles, awakening deepens temperament’s calm,
After grasping Heaven’s heart, emotions grow distant.
You’ve fully attained Meng’s joy—boundless,
Yet to know Qu’s non-self—still in excess.
Mostly, empty fame is as you say—
This body willingly ages among woodcutters and fishermen.

**First Outing to the Luo River, Leaving Through Houzai Gate**

First stepping beyond the capital’s gate,
West and south, toward the Luo’s corner.
Mountains and rivers open distant thoughts,
Heaven and earth hang in both eyes.
Villages at dusk amid mulberries and elms,
Farmers’ fields of millet and sorghum in autumn.
The people have such joy—
Why wait for enfeoffment?

**Staying at Yanqiu Village**

Driving the carriage into the Luo River valley,
Dismounting to play by the flying spring.
Suddenly, the joy of clouds and mountains,
Utterly free of court and market clamor.
Not only does it delight the heart and will,
It naturally forgets the body’s words.
Asking friends in the dust—
Who has grasped it first?

**Staying at the West Temple of Shou’an**

Fine scenes truly move the heart,
Directly refreshing flesh and bone.
For the many fine vistas,
Especially glad to be near the capital.
Bamboo hues blend with mountain hues,
Pine sounds mingle with water sounds.
How could I refuse to love it all day?
I set my mat beside the empty pillars.

**Two Poems Crossing Yongji Bridge**

Behind the mountains, a brocade screen unfolds,
The river bends by Yongji’s turn.
Fields level as a palm,
Mulberries and oaks large as locust trees.
The slanting sun shoots through the rainbow’s departure,
Low clouds bring approaching rain.
Endlessly, I waste this pure scene—
Always ashamed of my lack of talent.

A stream, a creek—each a gate,
Creek gates where clouds gather again.
Rare birds warble in tall trees,
Secluded deer dart through wild brambles.
Rain trails across the flat land,
Rice paddies prop up distant villages.
The high city is half ruined—
Matters of rise and fall—best not discussed.

**Composed Upon Reaching Fuchang County**

How many love pure scenes?
Those who do must seek them far.
Only when near Han Peak,
Does one see the Luo River’s depth.
The county lies in the clouds and mountains’ embrace,
The people dwell in the heart of waters and bamboos.
Free of schemes, like idle things,
I feel even fewer know me.

**At Yan Hall**

Upon the river, several peaks green,
Amid the woods, a stream bright.
Wandering clouds have no fixed form,
Secluded birds bear no names.
Companions were not prearranged,
Return dates cannot be set.
The trifles of the human world—
Cease striving to be fierce.

**Viewing the Southern Mountains from the Upper Temple**

Peak upon peak,
Westward, they stretch to Liang and Yong’s expanse.

To view while traveling is not as good as to observe while seated.
Encompassing Tang and Han, engulfing Jin and Han,
Sunk and vanished—matters hard to inquire,
Only you remain, towering and rugged.

**At the County Magistrate’s Lotus Pond Study**

Before the magistrate’s small study,
The water is clear, the pond bears lotuses.
Not only to gaze at the blossoms,
But also to listen to the murmuring stream.
Just like by rivers and lakes,
Far from the dust and earth.
Where the ancients applied their minds,
Surely not in vain.

**The Shrine of Lady Ji**

To the southwest stands a lofty mountain,
Shrouded in the dim and distant.
Immortals cannot be seen,
Only endless clouds and mist.
The thousand-year-old shrine of Lady Ji,
Its gate by the banks of the Luo River.
Only the strains of *Nishang* remain,
Still passed down among the people.

**The Ruins of Lianchang Palace**

The Luo River comes from the southwest,
The Chang River from the northwest.
Where the two waters merge,
Palace walls bear remnant bricks.
Travelers vainly imagine,
All past affairs now mere traces.
Only Lady Ji’s mountain remains,
Facing the Three Villages Post.

**On the River, Recalling the Past**

Last autumn I roamed the source of the Luo,
This autumn I roam the Luo’s course.
Though the river’s waters are unfeeling,
The human heart grows still.
Eyes dazzled by a thousand mountains,
Each peak wreathed in mist.
When the mountains end, the mist does not,
Merging with the boundless sky.
Farmers busy tending crops,
Waterfowl idly seeking fish.
One toils for food, the other rests—
How different their ways.
Yet when events pass, joy and sorrow are seen,
When times change, expansion and contraction are known.
Looking back at these two,
Switched in place—what then?
Today’s mountains were once plains,
Today’s plains were once rivers.
If even mountains and rivers change so,
How much more should human affairs be trusted?
Fortunate to escape the red dust,
I ride the wind and waves, lashing the whip.
The land stretches far, rivers and plains vast,
A lone village by misty waters at ease.
Lightning flickers as dragons cross the shore,
Clouds scatter as rain shifts the mountains.
Farmers shoulder their hoes and leave,
Fishermen return with nets on their backs.
Only I am drenched,
Still on the road.

**Summer Drinking at Yan Hall**

Yan Hall opens to the heights,
Its eaves clinging to jagged cliffs.
Cool winds come through pine boughs,
Clear springs cascade through bamboo shade.
Fine fruits mingle red and green,
Choice wine flows shallow and deep.
Yet I recall the bustling markets,
Where stifling heat cannot be borne.

**Leisure at Yan Hall**

The net of heaven is wide, hard to escape,
The net of the world is dense, impossible to pass.
My heart long unmoved,
Freed from both nets.
Tall bamboos rinse in clear springs,
Towering pines welcome the pure wind.
Or again: the moon between pines, so free,
The wind beyond bamboos, so cool.
At this moment, meeting this scene,
It perfectly matches this heart.

**Composed on the River on the Day of Beginning of Autumn**

Wealth and honor are hard to love,
Poverty and cold easily bring sorrow.
Do not carry youthful airs
Into old age as shame.
Since there is extraordinary joy,
Beware of unexpected grief.
Who can guarantee the end from the beginning,
To remain forever a duke or marquis?

**Discourse on Bear Ear Mountain**

Long ago, Yu divided the Nine Provinces,
Guiding the Luo from Bear Ear.
Bear Ear has two peaks—
Which one is correct?
The eastern one lies near Chengzhou,
The western one is cut off by the Dan River.
The records speak of Shangluo—
This saying is right.

**Climbing Lady Ji’s Mountain**

I have seen many mountains,
But never encountered such marvels.
Vast cliffs like crouching tigers,
Perilous rocks like unfurled banners.
Clouds idle, now spreading, now rolling,
Rock forms shifting again and again.
Even with brush and ink, hard to depict—
On all sides, it is just so.

**Gazing South at Yi River from the River**

The mountain retains Yu’s chiseled gate,
The river holds Yao’s water marks.
The ancients are no longer seen,
Yet their traces may still remain.
Years and months easily wither,
Good and evil are hard to bury.
Do not pursue fame in recent times,
Striving for worldly esteem.

**The Cowherd Boy**

Following with hat and raincoat,
Never disturbing heaven’s harmony.
Warmth plays by the ruined city,
Cold nestles by ancient tombs.
A few notes from the ox-back flute,
A tune from the ridge’s song.
He seems without care,
Asking nothing of court affairs.

**Chanting in a Dream on the Road to Three Villages**

Speaking of dreams within a dream, still remembered,
Awake from the dream, the dream is yet distant.
Today’s favor and glory are empty joy,
Yesterday’s love and affection are hard to find.
Where water flows, how can there be no sound?
When flowers fade, how can there be color?
Passing this, meeting strangers on the road,
All as if never known before.

**Thirty-Six Autumn Thoughts**

**I**
The autumn night begins long,
Stars and constellations vie in brilliance.
The courtyard, washed by light rain,
Pillow and mat grow slightly cool.
Shining on things, no form escapes,
The empty mirror has its own light.
Shining on affairs, no feeling escapes,
The empty heart has its own constancy.

**II**
At the bright window, the sun’s glow fades,
The secluded courtyard, freshly washed by rain.
Red orchids quietly unfold,
Green bamboos idly lean together.
Honor and profit like floating clouds,
Feelings as light as water.
Not a man from beyond the heavens,
Yet thoughts arise from beyond the heavens.

**III**
The bright moon rises from the sea’s heart,
Cool winds stir at the sky’s edge.
Things reveal themselves,
The heart suddenly opens wide.
Understanding all the power of Zhou and Confucius,
Untying the knots of benevolence and righteousness.
Rites and laws were meant to guard against treachery,
Not set for us.

**IV**
Sparse rain drips on the tall parasol tree,
Gentle winds brush the tender willows.
This scene repeats year after year,
Yet people still grow old.
Worldly cares easily entangle,
Dusty hearts hard to shake off.
Floating life is already in a dream,
Forcing existence within it.

**V**
Clear rapids pattern mandarin ducks,
Cold pools embroider cormorants.
The vast sky, pure as water,
Does not hinder the autumn river’s green.
A man’s inch-long heart,
A warrior’s match for ten thousand foes.
Amid lotus-scented winds,
A lone boat—we will meet again.

**VI**
Yesterday I longed for cool broth,
Today I long to put away the fan.
Not only do people wield spears,
Heat and cold wage their own battles.
Profit and harm arise from feeling,
Likes and dislikes depend on perception.
To wish others to be good,
One must first be good oneself.

**VII**
Sweet persimmons, green as indigo,
Red peaches, fresh as blood.
I cannot bear to pluck them with my hands,
Much less bite them with my teeth.
Their color is already lovely,
Their taste even more exquisite.
Eating them, no fine words,
Alas for mouth and tongue.

**VIII**
The nation’s fate lies with the people,
The people’s fate lies with food.
Even if the sages were reborn,
This saying would not change.

Empty favors—how could they be esteemed?
They teach men to indulge and coddle.
Empty fame—how could it be exalted?
It teaches men to adorn and deceive.

The *Zhou Odes* speak of taking a wife,
The *Zhou Yi* speaks of the maiden’s return.
The Seventh Night’s worldly passions,
The pleading for skill in girls’ frivolous postures.
At dusk, clouds and rain pass—
People say the Herd-Boy and Weaver Girl meet.
Yet the thunderbolt’s trace vanishes without a mark,
How could the Herd-Boy and Weaver Girl be paired?

A pure breeze needs no companion—
It enters my hands of its own accord.
The bright moon needs no peer—
It enters my window of its own will.
When the heart is already at peace,
What outer thing could ever tempt?

Trivial matters—why discuss them?
I only fear the wine jar will run dry.
Green plantain leaves unfurl,
Blue reeds bow low.
Wind and rain howl through the sky,
The night deepens with the water-clock’s drip.

Those things are blameless in themselves,
Why should this feeling surprise?
Yet I think of the traveler on the road,
Still lingering at the edge of the horizon.
Faint mist veils the sparse woods,
A light wind sways the cold rain.
At dusk, people have all returned,
Only the flock of chickens still pecks at the millet.

This heart remains unmoved,
Yet this matter is most difficult to handle.
To sum it up in a single word—
I fear even that would waste breath.

In the eighth month, heat and chill balance,
The qi and flavor are naturally fine.
Facing the void, tall trees bow low,
From afar, the traveler appears small.
All traces of affairs are illusions,
With a heart devoid of intent, things are all resolved.
Why ask further about bitterness?
I wish only that you taste the smartweed yourself.

Yellow millet ripens in autumn,
Yellow chickens grow plump in autumn.
These things are easily obtained,
The ancients held them in high regard.
They can welcome guests and friends,
They can serve one’s parents’ chambers.
With coarse cloth, one can endure the year—
What else is worth pursuing?

Rice is born of heaven,
Yeast is crafted by man.
Ferment it and call it wine—
Drink it, and one may become drunk.
The rigid it makes supple,
The timid it makes resolute.
It skillfully wields the power of creation—
Its merit is no small thing.

Autumn’s hues deepen day by day,
The old heart grows ever more indolent.
Weary, I descend the steps to walk,
At leisure, I toy with books and scrolls.
Wide roads teem with wind and dust,
I hear it is hard to find a moment’s rest.
The gates of noble houses are already deep,
The imperial palace’s gates are even more distant.
The frontier geese have yet to arrive,
The swallows of the rafters have already departed.
Clouds and mountains stretch in a thousand layers—
Where shall we meet again?

The city gates of Jiye rise high,
The long pavilion roads wind far.
The land’s ways ruin men’s clothes—
Newly made, they soon turn old.
Beyond the intermittent cries of cicadas,
Sparse hawks descend ahead.
The years pass in vain,
Human affairs grow ever more desolate.

Washing the bamboo to preserve new shoots,
Turning the pages to find old writings.
Who knows the one who nurtures the heart
Would ever vie with the world for power?

The Mid-Autumn’s scenery is fine,
The Central Plains’ mist and waters are wondrous.
The season of the first chill,
The moment when men are half-drunk.
The couch awaits the bright moon’s sweep,
The lapel awaits the fine wind’s caress.
A single matter in the heart—
The world knows nothing of it.

A fine moon fills the high tower,
The high tower still in Mid-Autumn.
At midnight, cold dew descends,
A thousand miles of cold light flows.
Who will take up this mirror,
Wipe it clean, newly polished, and rest?
Illuminating one breaks the heart of ten thousand ages,
Whitening ten thousand ages’ heads.

Cold dew clings to withered grass,
A bleak wind shakes the evening woods.
Bird cries rise and fall,
The sky’s mood shifts from clear to overcast.
The season changes in an instant,
The heart holds a thousand ages’ longing.
Who says Ziji is dead?
The whole world lacks a knowing friend.

Wind-tossed willows scatter like a comb,
Frost-laden clouds thin as a broom’s sweep.
A high tower pierces the perilous void,
Low mist sways in the early cold.
At this moment, my mood is boundless—
How can I battle autumn’s aging?
I can only take up the wine bottle
And pour it out to the west wind.

Pond lotuses daily wither,
Hedge chrysanthemums daily flourish.
Among the ranks of things,
They contend with the seasons’ rhythm.
Flourishing and decay do not coincide,
The worthy and foolish cannot walk side by side.
How can one obtain the heart of pine and cassia,
Evergreen through all four seasons?

Men grow old as autumn grows older,
Mountains deepen, waters deepen.
Tall trees have already shed their leaves,
Wise birds sing in vain.
Sinews and bones are not as they once were,
Virtue betrays its original intent.
Fortunately, my remaining writings endure—
From time to time, they may still be sought.

In the ninth month, the qi suddenly turns stern,
Withered willows still harbor cicadas.
Beyond the frost, sparse bells fall silent,
The wind’s remnants carry clear sounds.
A thousand mountains confuse the distant gaze,
A lone osprey soars into the high heavens.
If one is not a transcendent being,
How dare one speak of perilous deeds?

Pears redden under heavy frost,
Pomegranates split after long rain.
These fruits are called treasures of the world,
Their flavors are truly astonishing.
The earth holds a hundred things in readiness,
Heaven hangs not a single word.
I fear I still have words,
Unable to match the workings of creation.

Only in the south are fine tangerines,
Only in the north are fine chestnuts.
Their husks may be somewhat alike,
Their flavors are surely not the same.
Do heaven and earth lack feeling?
All plants and trees bear fruit.
Things do not betray man—
Man betrays himself to things.

Butterflies flutter around cold chrysanthemums,
Crickets chirp on empty steps.
A dog lies at the gate,
All day, no guests arrive.
Clear waves flow in stillness,
White clouds pile in leisure.
How to bring forth heaven’s harmony?
From time to time, drink a cup of wine.

Red leaves battle the west wind,
Yellow blossoms laugh at the cold sun.
The Dao of heaven has its waxing and waning,
Human affairs have no fixed certainty.
Stillness prevails, leaving a lingering savor,
Dreams depart, revealing what was lost.
Profit and harm do not follow one another,
Right and wrong only then emerge.

On the Double Ninth, climbing high to gather,
Seeking the secluded to share refined joy.
Customs follow old traditions,
The weather offers a light chill.
White wine is drunk in unstrained drafts,
Yellow blossoms are viewed with dew still clinging.
The floating world’s affairs sink away—
Why should one value fleeting waves?

Mountains stretch into the evening haze,
Crows vanish beyond the lone wisp of smoke.
Fading chrysanthemums fear the frost’s crushing,
Hidden orchids dread the wind’s ruin.
Hardship and danger—people do not favor them,
Wealth and honor—people cherish them.
My heart is not my own—
How could love and hate be for sale?

Water grows cold, revealing the heart of the pool,
Trees shed their leaves, baring the mountain’s bones.
Only now do I believe heaven has no bounds—
Ten thousand miles do not separate things.
I shed my clothes and hang them on Fusang,
Reach my hand to explore the moon’s cave.
Not betraying the heart of benevolence and righteousness—
A mere fifty-one years.

Grass is green, dew soaks the clothes,
Grass withers, wind cuts the skin.
Things’ feelings do not change—
Men’s minds forcibly conjure doubt.

The fork stirs, Yang Zhu weeps;
The thread lengthens, Mozi grieves.
Knowing this—why so late?
In vain, tears stream down.

Beyond ten thousand miles of clear sky,
A slice of moon on the frost.
Tall pines stand evergreen,
While all other blooms fade and vanish.
Teeth daily grow weaker,
Hair daily falls away.
Offenses already mount high—
This heart cannot be trifled with.

Grass withers, mountains and rivers grow poor;
Trees shed, heaven and earth grow lean.
Dust fills the wind’s path,
Sunlight barely slips through cloud-gaps.
The past cannot be chased again,
The future may yet be saved.
Other matters I dare not speak—
To speak them would surely bring blame.

Wine I drink, not too much,
A few cups flush face and heart.
Before drunk, I cannot stop;
Once drunk, persuasion is vain.
Who says the ten thousand things are vast?
Do they extend beyond heaven and earth’s bounds?
Who says the ten thousand affairs are broad?
Do they stretch beyond the realm of human feeling?

**Poem for Prefect Zhang of Shanzhou at Stone Pillar Village**
You serve as Prefect of Shanzhou,
I am truly a descendant of Lord Kang.
Our first ancestor left a noble legacy—
I entrust you to seek what remains.
You sent me a poem,
Titled *Stone Pillar Village*.
When the stone pillar was first erected,
Its origins were lost in antiquity.
The *Fen Shaan Inscription* was carved there,
Yet only Tang scholars spoke of it.
Years have passed in great number,
Its beginning and end now lack complete text.
Hard to verify or correct,
How then to trace its source?
I lament my scant reading,
My knowledge no greater than others’.
Beyond classics and histories,
I cannot dispel the world’s confusion.
If following Changqing’s *Gongyang*,
It should begin at Shaan.
If following your *Chen Biming*,
It should speak of Zhou’s completion.
Taking both together,
The meaning may yet be honored.
Dividing governance between east and west suburbs,
One may discuss it in terms of Shaan and Luo.
If this explanation nears the mark,
Perhaps it may ease the tangle.

The sweet pear’s shade still flourishes,
The stone pillar remains fresh and green.
The grand affairs of that time,
I could not witness firsthand.
The pure teachings of *Er Nan*,
The noble fragrance of those two lords—
A tale of beauty for a thousand years,
I may yet hear of it.

To abandon the classics and rely on commentaries,
Confucian scholars fundamentally reject.
I write this poem to clarify,
Hastening this humble reply to you.

**Free Expression**
Having attained the joy of stillness and emptiness,
I am no longer startled by favor or disgrace.
Mud and void—still attachments;
Equalizing things—ultimately a struggle.
Idly I pick up the brush,
From time to time writing my own name.
Who can truly harm their nature,
To conjure feelings beyond feeling?

*Volume Three of Yi Chuan’s "Striking the Earth Collection" concludes.*
*Volume Four of Yi Chuan’s "Striking the Earth Collection" begins.*

**Thanking Minister Wang Jun of the Bureau of Etiquette for the Completion of the New Residence in Tianjin**
*Seventh Year of Jiayou (1062)*

In the *renyin* year of Jiayou,
The new nest’s work was just □.
Still part of Daode Lane,
Yet nearer the imperial palace.
Railings face the towering Gate of Correct Deportment,
Verandas welcome the mighty Two Observatories.
Windows open to the echoes of Chan and Jian streams,
Terraces distant, gleaming with Yi and Song peaks.
Fine scenery is ever hard to come by,
Auspicious times are not easily met.
Lacking talent to aid the realm,
I am content to enjoy a year of abundance.
Water and bamboo cradle the heart,
Orioles and flowers dwell in deep pools.
Like Lao Lai, my joy knows no end,
The delight of quiet integrity is boundless.
Carefree, I keep company with true friends,
Planning to congratulate Your Excellency.
My red sincerity is but self-expression—
Not repayment for your profound kindness.

**New Spring Chant**
At fifty-two, my bones and sinews ail,
Yet this new spring I still share cups with friends.
Xunzi’s words on embodying form—ever rare,
Hui’s joy within—unmatched in merit.
Swallows come and go, vainly toiling,
Flowers bloom and fade, heedlessly hastening.
This heart does not sway for others’ joys or sorrows—
For twenty years, it has been as ash.

**A Guest’s Chant**
Between Yi and Song, a guest would speak no words,
Advancing or retreating—all awaits heaven’s will.
Loving quiet, I cannot forget streams and stones,
Finding joy in leisure—not to learn immortality.
No need to sigh over purple streets, hard for guests,
Just delight in the clean wind, which costs no coin.
Why quibble over bending a foot to gain a yard?
This heart is vast—it seeks no perfection.

**Encountering Spring in the Small Garden**
Content with pavilions and railings, I too play at beauty,
No harm in lingering by the wine stove.
Night eaves quietly admit the moon through flowers,
Daytime doors chill with mist beyond the bamboo.
Things, once understood, are all by chance—
Heaven’s decree to be idle is not in vain.
How much time fills the gourd’s sun and moon?
Twelve years of splendid scenery, wantonly seized.

**Late Spring Chant**
Spring arrives, the small garden teems with blossoms—
Who dwells in poverty, who in wealth and honor?
Beyond the gate, willow shade floats in emerald luster,
Before the steps, flower shadows glide in crimson light.
New swallows under the beams have yet to tune their tongues,
Returning geese at the sky’s edge have already taken flight.
I ask my heart’s source—what does it hold?
It answers: a fondness for carefree indolence.

**Cherishing the Fragrant and Luxuriant**
Weighing the world’s thousand affairs,
All lose to flowers’ shared delight.
Most of spring’s splendor lasts but a season,
Its full glory barely ten days.
I fear sorrow may bring discord,
And guard against wind and rain’s hardships.
Let not regret follow after—
Before the fire fades, one may still climb.

**Reply to a Gift**
My temples need not fret over turning frost,
For I have the solace of zither and books, and you.
Lacking great talent to serve a flourishing age,
I can but rest my head on the southern window.
I know my strength cannot be forced,
Yet still speak of mountains and clouds not yet surrendered.
Deep thanks to my old friend for such love—
Like a stranded fish, I am spared from the western river’s plight.

**Playing with the Brush**
At fifty-two, what more have I to fear in old age?
Affairs are valued when seen to the bottom,
Words are hard to speak to the end.
Above, there is a bright Son of Heaven,
Below, worthy lords and nobles.
Beyond a full belly and sound sleep,
I seek nothing more.

**Begging Wine from a Friend**
A hundred ailments plague this old body,
White-haired today, I shamefully drift along.
Though no purple edict summons me back to court,
Green mountains often enter my dreams.
Who is master of wind and moon filling the sky?
Are there no men in forests and springs across the land?
Market wine’s flavor is rarely pure—
I long betray my heart’s springtime.

**Reply to a Guest**
Countless acquaintances in the world,
Though many know me, few truly do.
Most gaze upon me for the Dao,
Yet know me shallowly through my poems.
Ask not of rise and fall in a hundred years—
Past and present all return to one game of chess.

**Riding a Steed**
One must seek a mount like the qilin or steed,
Yet how can such a steed appear in due time?

**A Word of Enlightenment**
A hundred schemes still prove clumsy,
But one word of confusion may yet dissolve.
The world holds no great matters,
Yet the land abounds with heroic talent.
I fear only that men are hard to find,
Not that the Dao remains unrevealed.
When envy’s heart is wholly cast aside,
What dust remains to trouble me?

**Thanks for the Gift of a Brush**
I cherish this gift of the study,
Gratefully received from afar.
The rabbit’s hair is firm and strong,
The bamboo shaft straight and long.
In stillness, I transcribe new poems,
In leisure, I copy old remedies.
Beyond such uses, it is enough
To nurture the blade’s keen edge.

**Composed on Affairs**
Heaven and earth hold eternal principles,
Sun and moon never hide their forms.
Beyond a full belly and sound sleep,
All else is but empty fame.
Though lacking the talents of Yi or Lü,
I remain a subject of Yao and Shun.
Why must one become a minister
To bring about great peace?

**Twin-Lotus Blossoms**
The Han court’s graceful sisters,
The divine maidens of Tiantai’s peaks—
All once knew the passions of their time,
Yet were banished to earth as auspicious lotuses.

**Reply to a Letter**
Confucius spoke of rectifying one’s nature,
Ziyou of embodying one’s form.
Who attains these two
Lives not in vain.
If friendships are forged through the Dao,
And feelings stirred by sincerity,
Then though three armies stand before you,
None can overpower you.

**In Response to a Letter**
Without rank, establishing deeds is hard;
Meeting the times, achieving merit is easy.
Seeking perfection invites ruin,
Pursuing greatness requires overlooking details.
To reject evil risks wounding kindness,
To tolerate evil risks harming righteousness.
Though the heart of a benevolent man beats,
His intent remains far from true benevolence.

**Reply to a Letter**
A minister’s yearly stipend
Would fund a poor scholar’s lifetime.
Worldly titles differ,
But the heavenly title is never lacking.
Without frost and snow,
How would we know the pine and cassia?
Though no office elevates me,
How can the Dao not ennoble me?

**Reminiscing with an Old Friend**
What ears and eyes have witnessed,
I recount from thirty springs.
Ten intercalary months have passed,
And people have changed once more.
The old families cling to their ways,
While the vermilion gates host new carriages.
All has always been by chance—
What can be called true merit?

**Idle Verses**
Casually I take up my brush,
Ever delighting in the spirit’s play.
Never without a scene to match,
Yet never bound by emotion.
Lines come drifting into being,
Poems form by chance.
The workings of heaven are hard to describe—
Yet one point stands clear.

**Idle Sitting**
I once planned for the years ahead,
Yet today’s affairs elude my grasp.
Heaven’s mandate does not favor me,
So I find solace in mountains and clouds.
Through no merit of my own, I grow detached,
And so approach the realm of the profound.
I would mock the true master,
Who toils without knowing why.

**Strolling at Tianjin**
The Son of Heaven’s ancient domain,
Where lush vitality still lingers.
Gardens and woods lie near the water,
Palaces and towers stretch into autumn’s distance.
The waves recall summer’s heat,
The bridge’s rainbow fades not in the clear sky.
On days when the world knows no strife,
This place invites lingering.

**Secluded at Tianjin**
My home lies within Luoyang’s walls,
And here, too, at Tianjin’s edge.
The sun rises early here,
Spring comes easily to the low sky.
Time favors the state’s flourishing,
Scenery enriches the recluse.
I may now cast aside cap and sash,
And grow old in leisure here.

**The Sound of Tianjin’s Waters**
The Luo River flows near my hut,
Its murmurs reaching my pillow’s emptiness.
The rapids startle in late autumn,
The waves quicken at the fifth watch’s dawn.
Gentle winds trace their delicate paths,
Fierce rains swell their mighty currents.
For the recluse, this is joy enough—
Why wait for pipes and zithers?

**Sleepless**
The night deepens as I sit idly,
Yet sleep eludes me in the long hours.
Tossing, I cannot rest,
And so reflect on past affairs.
Pillow laid, my mind grows dull,
Blanket drawn, my thoughts remain bright.
In the moonlit western window,
A few leaves of the plantain sway.

**The Small Pavilion of Heavenly Palace**
In summer, I reach the Heavenly Palace,
Leaning on the railing, my gaze knows no bounds.
The ancients held lofty aspirations,
The Son of Heaven built a mighty capital.
Pavilions lie deep within clouds,
Mountains and rivers fade into evening mist.
Travelers come and go in vain—
Who shares this sentiment?

**Listening to the Qin**
The qin is best heard at night,
Awakening a different feeling.
Just as the mournful gibbons fall silent,
The parting phoenix begins its cry.
The green mountains stretch endlessly,
White hair need not cause alarm.
Only when one grasps the mind of sitting-in-forgetfulness
Does one know the heart of the distant past.

**Twenty-Six Reflections on Tianjin**

Light clouds, pale sun—dusk at Tianjin,
Fierce winds, sparse woods—autumn on the Luo.
Walking alone, chanting alone, none understand,
As gulls and egrets alight on the islets.

Favor and disgrace—matters now unseen,
Rise and fall—times gone, only sorrow remains.
Look upon Chang’an’s roads today—
Even at dusk, people still come and go.

The phoenix tower’s depths lock away clouds and mist,
A hundred years pass with each sealing.
Grieving for the sacrifices at Fenyin’s western altar,
The imperial banners betray the heavens of Shangyang.

Who drew the long river through Luoyang’s walls?
The imperial carriage’s eastward journey made light of this place.
The mighty waves chafe at Tianjin’s restraints,
Day and night roaring in furious tumult.

The sun sets in the west, waters flow east,
Time shifts through the passing years.
Distant mountains gather their dark hues on all sides—
Who do they grieve for all day long?

Busy men bear burdens—what difference between the two?
Coming and going always follow this path.
How much better to sit idly, untalented,
With clouds and waters swirling about my robes.

They say fishing discerns the floating and sinking,
But such discernment demands deep intent.
I am ashamed not to know the harm in desire,
Yet lightly stir my heart in hope of catching fish.

Since ancient times, abandoned capitals hold many empty spaces,
Towering trees teem with cawing crows at dusk.
Where crumbling walls and broken ramparts are tilled by men,
Half were once the homes of ministers and nobles.

The phoenix towers stand cold in autumn’s chill,
Beneath the bridge, long waves flow toward the sea.
For a thousand years, this was the old imperial market—
How many times have people passed through here?

Hooves and wheels clash without cease,
Departing as if in pursuit, arriving as if in contest.
I reckon their hearts hold no other concern—
If not for profit, then for fame.

Trees fade into autumn’s embrace,
Homes nestle amid the sound of waters.
A few rows of crows fly off at an angle,
A cluster of towers clings precariously to the void.

The clear waters stretch to the azure sky,
The level plains merge with distant mountains.
An old man with white hair, his heart at ease,
Leans idly on the railing, gazing at the Luo River.

Last year’s man who leaned on the bridge’s railing,
This year rides past its edge on horseback.
Bridge above and bridge below—countless crossings,
Yet now I recall only thirteen springs.

By the embankment, grasses grow lush and green,
On the paths, travelers come and go.
The clear waters strive for purity but never attain it,
The spring winds refuse to let the willow branches rest.

Though currents rush, the scene remains serene,
Though blossoms fall in profusion, the mind stays at ease.
Unlike men of the world who age in busyness,
Never once in their lives knowing an open smile.

By the stream, I sit idly, my eyes half-lidded,
Waves strike the long embankment as if to break it.
How many waterfowl, their plumage bright with color,
Again and again take flight, then return.

Fame and profit have always followed talent,
No need for travelers to guess at one another’s schemes.
How much time lies within the gourd’s embrace?
I stroll the Heavenly Ford, watching the ebb and flow.

The land tilts southeastward as a whole,
When will its waters ever find peace?
The Heavenly Ford lies where the currents race fastest—
Endless depths, all roaring with the same sound.

Three thousand *li* away, the frontier is called wild,
For a hundred years, the realm has been at peace.
Yet how can it compare to the carefree man of the Luo River,
Who needs no fief to know true honor?

Willows sway around the embankment in the soft wind,
Pavilions across the water stand veiled in fine rain.
After the Double Ninth, wine leaves one half-tipsy—
At this moment, the flavor is beyond compare.

Observing the world’s affairs from a place of stillness,
Refining one’s feelings in leisure’s embrace:
When all storms subside and only still waters remain,
What in this world cannot be made level?

Since Sui and Tang, nobles and ministers have been exalted,
In recent times, men chase fame and profit through turmoil.
I ask the waters beneath the Heavenly Ford Bridge:
What sound did their rushing make in those days?

Countless nobles and ministers of former dynasties—
Later ages remember only their names.
Yet these waters beneath the Heavenly Ford Bridge
Have flowed with the same sound from ancient times to now.

Not a wisp of cloud dares touch the bright moon,
The bridge spans a thousand *xun*, lying across the green waves.
I reckon no such scene exists in the human world—
How could one’s mood not soar when gazing at the moon on Mid-Autumn?

In the city of Jiaoru, with friends of shared virtue,
Beneath the Phoenix Towers, we gather for the Mid-Autumn festival.
The fragrant wine is drained, and the guests depart,
Yet the moonlight and ripples still vie in brilliance.

Only when life is understood can one speak of constancy,
Only when nature is known can one discuss great plans.
This long river flows day and night without cease—
For whom is it driven so relentlessly eastward?

**Cheng Ming Yin**
Confucius was born with knowledge, not through study,
Mencius had prior insight, yet still needed cultivation.
Sincerity and clarity are our family’s own affairs—
Why do men of today seek them elsewhere?

**Sheng Shui Yin**
Water excels at leveling but not at straightening,
The plumb line excels at straightening but not at leveling.
If water and plumb line could be made one,
What in the world would remain unclear?

**Xin Suan Yin**
Pungent and sour are not the central flavors,
How can *shang* and *zheng* be the proper tones?
The world cannot distinguish right from wrong—
Who then can serve as master to calm the heart?

**Ji Mo Yin**
When silence is called for, speech is but dust,
When speech is called for, silence is but grime.
If one neither speaks nor stays silent as the moment demands,
How can dust and grime ever touch the self?

**Idle Musings on Life**
Not a trace of heavenly truth is lost,
Yet a thousand measures of human emolument are hard to come by.
In this age of peace, I have no other joy—
Only wine, three or five cups from time to time.

Bamboo rain chills the air as it soaks one through,
By the southern window, I wake from sleep and gaze toward Xiaoxiang.
The thatched eaves drip without cease—
I recall the nights spent aboard boats long ago.

At first light, the moon emerges from the pines,
In the height of summer, the wind comes from the water’s surface.
I have more than most men already—
How much more when I can raise my cup again and again?

My mother in the hall is over eighty,
Before the steps, my children laugh and call to one another.
Fine foods are taken as they come, in plenty or in want—
Is there any joy in the world to match this?

For three days in a row, I rarely lack pure delight,
Though deep drinking never exceeds five parts.
When we meet, our hearts hold no other matter—
We do not debate rise and fall, only discuss literature.

Flowers and trees mark the seasons with their scenes,
A thousand volumes of classics are called my livelihood.
If anyone asks where I dwell in idleness,
It is the first house in the Morality Ward.

**Cooling in the Small Pavilion of Heavenly Palace**
From the small pavilion, I gaze out over Luoyang,
The river and sky’s expanse cradles the divine capital.
Winds come from the peak of Ten-Thousand-Year Mountain—
How many mists and clouds share this clarity?

The small pavilion has done me great service,
Its coolness unmatched in all of Luoyang.
Ashamed of my own insignificance and good fortune,
My sleeves and lapels forever hold the winds of a thousand *li*.

How rare it is to bear the pavilion’s cool breeze—
Its mood is that of the ancient sages.
In Luoyang lives a nameless guest
Who for twenty years has enjoyed this coolness.

**Idle Musings in a Stifling Summer Retreat**
Men find the Heavenly Ford distant,
They must come with purpose.
In leisure, I know the Way is at peace,
In stillness, I feel my spirit open.

I grasp the *Yi* while watching a game of chess,
Discuss poetry while toying with a wine cup.
The world’s affairs take a thousand forms—
None of them trouble my heart.

**Visiting Longmen**
The river and sky show little difference,
A solitary bird descends to the sunlit sands.
The road ahead cuts through the mountain’s shape,
The river bends where the ferry crossing slants.

Caves and cliffs stand empty by the thousands,
Two or three households make up the inns.
The clear scenery is fine in all four seasons—
How much more so when the capital is not far off?

**Returning to the Luo River**
To buy stone is to have clouds in abundance,
To buy a mountain is to follow the water.
Clouds can bring about a mind without intent,
Water can serve as a mirror to still the self.

Nature is made clear by a mind without intent,
Feelings are stilled by the mirror’s reflection.
Neither can be lost—
One emerges from the other.

**Watching Fish by the River**
The air is cold with autumn’s touch,
The river long, the fish at play.
Though they know how to avoid the net,
They still fear swallowing the hook by mistake.

They have given up hope of leaping the dragon gate,
No longer worry about striking their heads.
I think of the joy by the Hao River—
Zhuang Zhou’s carefree spirit alone understands.

*The Fourth Volume of Yi Chuan Ji Rang Concludes*
*The Fifth Volume of Yi Chuan Ji Rang Begins*

**Three Poems on Immediate Matters in the Rear Garden**
*Jia You Eighth Year*

In this age of peace, though old, what care have I?
I wander my home’s garden at leisure, free.
A few willows cast their shade, just now entwined,
A few birds sing softly, their voices soon stilled.

Bamboo crowds the old path, rising high and low,
Water fills the spring channels, flowing left and right.
If you ask what joy the master finds here—
He answers: no different from a marquis’ life.

Nature nurtures my indolence, and I know its way,
In Luoyang, I’ve claimed my share of water and cloud.
I hear no worldly storms, no treacherous waves,
Only the long days and months within my winecup.

A game of chess detains a wandering guest,
A few cups of fine wine face the tall bamboo.
When all worldly matters are seen through—
Even Yan Hui’s seated oblivion seems no more.

---

In recent years, my illness is called "poetic madness,"
Each bout of madness must be met with wine.
My heart delights in the Dao, careless of restraint,
My words flow freely, unburdened by thought.

Friends grow closer with time, our bonds endure,
Like clouds and water, our leisure runs deep.
Now I understand Yuanming’s profound intent—
This window, in his day, rivaled Fuxi’s age.

---

**Watching Chess and Chanting Long**

The courtyard is still, spring deep, the door ajar,
Between bamboo, I watch guests contend at chess.
They gather gods and ghosts within their minds,
Arrange rivers and mountains within their grasp.

The board forms dragons and snakes in battle array,
The game ends, geese and crows scatter in flight.
Like Xiang Yu burying Qin’s soldiers in slaughter,
Or Fu Jian’s defeat before Jin’s might.

On the board, spears and shields clash fiercely,
Before their eyes, ice and fire swiftly shift.
Life and death rest on two households’ fate,
Victory and defeat hinge on a single move.

No mercy is given where paths cross,
Facing others, one must feign refusal.
To suffer harm in heart is truly dreadful,
Yet even lips and teeth may yet be healed.

To wound with subtle schemes is called good strategy,
To act with cunning in secret is deemed wise.
Look now upon Chang’an’s roads—
Who here has not played such games?

---

**Two Poems Ascending Chongde Pavilion on an Autumn Day**

Countless heroes, their ambitions crushed—
No need for sighs upon this height.
Mountains and rivers endure after a thousand wars,
Swords and crowns lie scattered after a hundred years.

Some take glory and fame as their own duty,
Yet who knows if wealth and rank are man’s design?
Painting and poetry exhaust the world’s wonders,
But what meaning lingers when leaning on the railing?

---

A hundred years have been called an age of peace,
Yet still, in the beginning, there was unrest.
The capital retains the air of Han and Tang,
The palace halls still lack a hegemon’s form.

Beyond the mist, jagged peaks barely emerge,
After frost, half the red trees fade and fall.
Wine in the cup cannot bring drunkenness—
The west wind wakes me again and again.

---

**Returning Late After Drinking on an Autumn Day**

Water and bamboo, gardens in autumn—how fine!
How could I bear to pour the fragrant wine so soon?
The Double Ninth has passed, chrysanthemums just bloom,
My heart is full, yet I’ve not learned to age with time.

Still clouds, drooping willows,
The wind carries a light chill, hastening dusk.
Boundless joy cannot be reined—
My horse’s hooves tread slowly through the celestial streets.

---

**Sent to Prefect Zu of Shaan, Gentleman of the Palace Zu Zezhi**

Do you recall our meeting?
Back then, in the eastern seas.
A thousand miles apart since we parted,
Ten years have slipped by in an instant.

Our paths differ, our names differ,
Yet our hearts are one, our years the same.
I hope we may meet again in clarity,
To share poetry and wine without end.

---

**Lament for Zhang Yuanbo, Director of the Bureau of Operations**

In recent years, the old guard has fallen one by one,
Stirring sorrow deep within me.
Of those who hung their caps in Luoyang and retired—
Only you were as pure as a transcendent.

Once we debated who was elder, who younger,
Now we vie to see who follows whom.
I pour wine to you—you must know—
For you, I shed tears before the west wind.

---

**Lament for Zhang Shirou, Section Chief**

All his life, he longed to establish merit and fame,
Who said talent must contend with fate?
His final poem expressed refined intent,
His coffin closed, but our friendship remained.

The affairs of the world in his heart—how to unfold them?
The realm’s talents will not be judged again.
If his spirit knows, he may find solace—
His descendants are more than capable of restoring the family name.

---

**Matching the Rhymes of Pei, Vice Magistrate of Dengfeng, Sent in the Renzi Year**

The tale of the narrow lane and bamboo bowl is well known,
Yet who am I to feel shame at such simplicity?
Since wealth and rank must come by fate,
Why ask heaven about rise or fall?

Silence and stillness cultivate my wild nature,
No path to soar like the sages of the age.
Those who come and go through golden gates—
Should they laugh at this old man tending his stony fields?

---

**Why Do You Send Poems to the Three Wealthy Lords of the Three Cities?**

Why do you urge me to ponder so deeply,
To seek transcendence with these few words?
Your actions should be like a thousand-catty crossbow,
Your tempering should be like a hundred-fold refined gold.

Fishing in water, you wield the power of life and death,
Playing chess, you stir the heart of war.
A cup of fine wine may bring some relief—
In the grove, I pour myself a drink from time to time.

---

**Letter Written on Behalf of a Friend**

In my youth, I aspired to stand above the world,
Reading ancient texts, I laughed at Xie An.
Who would have thought this body would grow old and useless,
With no idle ground to linger?

At chess, I meet worthy opponents, moves worth making,
But the zither lacks a knowing ear—I will not play.
Not only am I unworthy to withdraw in silence—
The ancients long lamented the rarity of opportunity.

---

**Visiting Yao Fuzhou, Vice Director of the Bureau of Evaluations, at Moon Dyke’s Western Garden**

Longing could not be restrained,
So I came to visit you on West Street.
Crossing ditches, winding through vegetable plots,
Trees bow their heads to make way,
My staff changes hands as I climb.

Among friends, our joy is complete—
What greater happiness could there be?

---

**Matching Rhymes in Thanks to Three Gentlemen of Dengfeng—Liu, Li, and Pei—for Inviting Me to Tour the Mountains**

The gentlemen invite me to Mount Song,
Each composing new poems in turn.
I shake off the dust, not daring to lag behind,
Yet in seeking clouds and water, I fear I’ve fallen behind.

Sanyang Palace lies near clusters of dark stones,
Wansui Peak towers, veiled in purple mist.
So many scenic spots I’ve yet to visit—
I long to follow the immortals’ footsteps and climb together.

---

**Ascending the Summit of Mount Song**

The nine provinces stretch far like a chessboard,
Wansui Peak stands tall, gazing upon peace.
If one man can govern the four seas,
Why should the Central Plains know strife again?

I long fear the rise of treacherous heroes,
Yet wish to be a simple subject of Yao and Shun.
Fifty-three years have passed in idle obscurity—
Now, at last, I rejoice to see the spring plowing.

---

**Viewing Shaoshi Temple in Dengfeng County**

**The Primordial Mountain**

When heaven and earth first congealed,
This mountain already stood at its loftiest height.
Peaks cluster like banners and pennants,
Mighty stones arrayed like swords and halberds.
At sunrise, the cliffs blush crimson first;
After rain, the mist glows an even deeper jade.
Who knows if immortals dwell here,
Long concealed within these hidden traces?

---

**Written in the Mountains, Sent to the Magistrate of Dengfeng**

No sooner had I left the county than I planned to stay the night,
Yet once in the mountains, I could not bear to turn back.
If the magistrate’s hall were free of civic affairs,
I would bring my tea set and ascend the peaks.

---

**Sent to Longtu of Zhengzhou, Zu Zezhi, on My Return to Luoyang**

Kindness runs deep as marrow—such is a loving parent;
Loyalty weighs heavy as mountains—such are old friends.
Passing through Songyang, the old haunts of my wanderings,
White clouds enfold this body clad in vines and creepers.

---

**In Response to Longtu’s Gift**

My family’s duty is to the clouds and mountains—
Without clouds and mountains, my face knows no ease.
The urge to wander cannot be bound by days or limits,
Even in dreams, my soul does not descend to the human realm.
Mists and peaks promise boundless joy,
While courtly caps and carriages offer but fleeting leisure.
Though I often think of gathering with friends in Luoyang,
When have I ever found time to climb even a little?

---

**On Ornamented Verses**

When adorned verses are perfected, one is called a master,
Yet the craftsmanship seems that of a true artisan.
Beware the cold-eyed observer’s gaze—
For puppets have no curtains to hide behind.

---

**Self-Reflection, Three Poems**

In the arena of fame and profit, it’s hard to plant one’s feet;
On the path to forests and springs, I turned back early.
Had I not, this fifty-year-old, worn-out body
Would still be tossed in the ceaseless winds and waves.

The sky’s wind and moon are my official charge,
The earth’s clouds and mountains my true authority.
Only I dare open my unguarded mouth,
Speaking freely to others without restraint.

Ever regretful my nature was dull and I heard the Dao late,
Ever ashamed my wisdom was shallow and the times unsuited.
A human life spans thirty-six thousand days—
For twenty thousand of them, this body has been at ease.

---

**Casual Jottings**

Opinions pour forth from every quarter—
Where are the true Confucians among the gentry?
The teachings of names and rites have always had their masters;
Across the ten thousand *li* of the Central Plains, are there truly no men?

Kings, emperors, lords, and earls—though their eras differed,
Rites, music, and the classics renewed the Dao in their own time.
Gazing at the past, so much is visible today—
Yet who knows what is meant by "statecraft"?

---

**Letter in Place of Writing to Magistrate Chen Chengbo of Shangluo**

Half a year remains before your term ends,
Yet Shangshan is remote and poor, with few skilled physicians.
Grief and sorrow may stagnate the *qi* after loss—
Chen Chengbo mourns his wife—
While summer damp breeds illness all too easily.
Even sages and wise men cannot escape misfortune;
The worthy alone know how to navigate sorrow and honor.
These words are simple, but their principle is not—
May they offer some small aid to a hero’s wisdom.

**Mid-Autumn of the Dingwei Year of the Zhiping Era: Traveling the Two Rivers of Yi and Luo**

**Sixth Day: Evening Departure from the West Gate of Luoyang, Lodging at a Monastery to Honor My Parents, Listening to Daoist Zhang Play the Zither**

As dusk fell, I drove my carriage out of Shangyang,
Beginning my journey by lodging in a land of water and clouds.
Then hearing several strains of an immortal’s melody,
I at last believed that within a gourd, days and months stretch long.

---

**Seventh Night: Ascending the Luo River, Lodging at Yanzhuang**

The eighth month, Yanzhuang’s grain ripens under autumn skies,
For farming families, wealth lies in a bountiful year.
A basket of millet, a gourd of wine—
Who envies the lords who feast on ten thousand coins?

---

**Eighth Day: Crossing the Luo, Ascending South Mountain, Visiting the Spouting Jade Spring; Magistrates Zhang and Zhao of Shou’an County Join the Excursion**

Crossing the Luo to view the Spouting Jade Spring,
A thousand peaks, ten thousand peaks stretch into the distance.
Between them, a single stream, long as snow,
Plunges into the icy pool, its age forgotten.

---

**Ninth Day: Ascending Jinping Mountain in Shou’an County, Lodging in the Town**

A cluster of mist and haze rises steeply—
Arriving here, the heart naturally stills.
Above dwell immortals whose names are unknown,
As the cave gate idly opens to drifting white clouds.

Riding side by side, we traverse Die Stone Creek,
Where sheer cliffs encircle us, level with the clouds.
Even the cascading waters seem to urge us to stay—
How could we betray our vow to dwell here one day?

*(Die Stone Creek lies five or six* li *south of the county.)*

---

**Tenth Day: Westward Passage over Yongji Bridge (a Tang Dynasty Bridge)**

On the tenth day, traveling west over Yongji,
Light rain dampens my robes from time to time.
The mountain spirits, in their kindness, seem to understand—
Fearing that travelers might miss the verdant peaks.

---

**Two Poems on Passing Yiyang City**

Six states, petty and weak, served Qin,
Exhausted by their running, yet still unable to please.
How could they slaughter half the realm,
As if the lands east of the Pass had no men left?

In those days, Yiyang was called a secondary capital—
Yet how could the state of Han have been so small?
Zhang Liang could not vent his lingering resentment,
So at Bolangsha, he struck the wrong carriage.

---

**Eleventh Day: Meeting Rain in Fuchang County**

Clouds shift slowly over the peaks,
The sound of springs lingers among the bamboo.
At this moment, boundless meaning—
Only the green-feathered birds know.

---

**Matching Rhymes with the Magistrate and Deputy of Du’an, Who Sent a Poem**

Not once have I lashed my horse into the red dust,
For I possess no talent worthy of the age’s favor.
My youthful ambitions have all come to naught—
Yet fate draws me to dwell in the green mountains.

In the shade of emerald bamboo, I open my silk-bound books;
Amid piles of white clouds, I bow to cascading springs.
Jinping Mountain faces Nanxi Stream—
One day, I shall wander there with you, my friend.

---

**Twelfth Day: Accompanying Magistrate Wang of Fuchang, a Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat, to Dragon Pool**

*(The pool lies in South Mountain, fifteen* li *from the county.)*

Two pools, cold and dark, lap at the black cliff’s base,
Several peaks rise high into the azure sky-road.
Visitors hold their breath, daring not speak,
Ever fearful that thunder might erupt beside them.

Sitting quietly by the water as dusk approaches,
I linger, unable to leave.
Turning my horse’s head for one last look,
Layers of clouds and mist already separate us.

---

**Thirteenth Day: Visiting Shangsi Monastery North of the County and Huangjian West of the County**

To leave the dusty world is to enter the true realm;
To fail to finish with the monastic life is to remain in the secular.
If not here, where shall I seek the grotto-heavens?
Where else shall I find hidden blossoms?

Alas for the Five Hegemons who fought over Zhou’s embers,
Laughable the Three Kingdoms who scavenged Han’s remnants.
How much better to sit idly, untalented,
While clouds and waters keep my robes at a distance.

---

**Fourteenth Day: Inscribed on the Eastern Pavilion of Fuchang County’s Hall**

Autumn enters the Luo River, the scene at its finest,
Light rain has just passed, the paths lie aslant.
Within the bamboo-and-water grotto hides the county hall,
While mist and haze enfold the homes of the people.

Frost-touched leaves, red amid a thousand layers,
Beyond the sky, a few wisps of sunset glow.
Shallow or deep, the creek shimmers clear and bright,
Peaks high or low stand jagged in jade.

Birds choose their trees and fly far,
Clouds drift without intent, their departure slow.

**On Worldly Glory**

Vast worldly merit and fame often clash,
Outstanding talent and deeds invite sighs.
The floating life of sun and moon must still be cherished,
Half-aged sinews and bones—boast no more.

Here by this cliff, a hut should be built,
To delight in my true joy, boundless and free.

---

**Fifteenth Day: Parting from Fuchang, with Some Feelings**

The Lianchang Palace lies ruined, the Chang River remains,
Events fade, times shift, words drift idly on.
Below stands a desolate shrine, hard to inquire of—
Ancient locust trees stand bare, bamboos pierce the sky.

---

**That Evening, Lodging Below Jinping Mountain**

The moon is ever lovely to behold,
Yet never so perfectly round as tonight.
I suspect the White Maiden eases some old regret,
Meeting me here before Jinping’s peaks.

---

**Sixteenth Day: Responding in Rhyme to the Magistrate of Fuchang’s Gift**

Dao and righteousness bring joy—how rare the bond,
As the ancients said, knowing others is hard.
Literature does not bind the men of court and market,
Honor and disgrace touch not the cloud-and-water self.

Words delve deeply into the patterns of things,
Speech leaves no trace, all is natural truth.
One day, when the Luoyang fellowship gathers,
Our records will add yet another neighbor.

---

**Seventeenth Day: At Jinping Mountain, Thanking Messrs. Zhang and Sun of the City for Their Gift of Tea**

Mountains like indigo waves, waters like dye,
A single line of thought resists all restraint.
Still bearing the tea shared by my two friends,
I brew it where mist and haze run deepest.

---

**Evening View at Shou’an County**

No need to sigh over life’s glory or disgrace,
Just listen all day to the murmuring stream.
A lone goose vanishes through the dusk’s haze,
Two egrets slice the wild mist on their return.

Fine trees stand like aged ranks below green cliffs,
Lovely peaks encircle the county in emerald.
They say those who slight fame and gain come here,
Stealing moments from time’s relentless flow.

---

**Eighteenth Day: Crossing the Sheep-Dragging Slope, Southward to the Tomb in Yi River**

A three-foot barrow, a hundred-foot hill,
Where a mother’s love for her child lies buried.
This love, even in death, knows no end—
At dusk, I linger and turn back again.

---

**Thoughts on the Cheng Family—Father, Sons, and Brothers—Sent to Them**

Year after year, the season nears mid-autumn,
Fine waters, fine mountains, radiant in play.
This time, my return is hastened for you,
No lingering longer by the Yi River.

The climate is as it was that day,
The mountains and streams seem as of old.
Alone I come, alone I go—
Who understands this feeling?

---

**Nineteenth Day: Returning to Luoyang, Passing Longmen**

To and from Yi River, I cross Dragon Mountain,
Each crossing leaves my mind at ease.
Do not say the scene fails to move the heart—
How can one bear the grip of profit and fame?

No need for external things to toy with the spirit,
Worldly ways are ever fickle, ever fond of the new.
Only the fine wind and moon before the steps remain—
Their pure light still belongs to the idle.

---

**Inscribed at Longmen**

Fused and formed, the years forgotten,
Sheer cliffs and green walls lock in misty sorrow.
Half the great creation is Xia’s kingly labor,
The Yi River’s flow cuts through the mighty mountain.

The Eight Rapids’ roar lingers in the ear,
A river’s scenery all gathers in the pavilion.
Travelers, do not stir your railing-longing—
Countless heroes have idly whitened their heads.

---

**Who wielded the long sword to slay the long flood-dragon?**
The dragon slain, the sword sheathed once more.
Claws and tail coil, congealing into Hua Peak,
Fangs and tusks fierce, knotting into Song’s heights.

Wounds scar two places on the sheer green cliffs,
Blood gushes eastward in surging waves.
Even this beast could not preserve its head and tail—
Beware the clamor of slanderous tongues.

---

**Viewing Yi River from the Stone Pavilion at Longmen**

For days I’ve wandered freely through mist and haze,
Leaning on the railing, gazing at the splendor.
A hundred-foot tower reaches the birds’ path,
A river of mist and water belongs to the monks.

Only when the heart is at ease is there true joy,
Only then does official glory lose its boast.
To roam such scenes on carefree days—
Know then that happiness knows no bounds.

**Twentieth Day: Returning to the City, Meeting Old Friends**

Year after year, I wander through mist and haze,
Yet who has ever called me greedy?
Returning, I meet old friends to speak of pure delight—
No need to guard against misfortune with triple-sealed lips.

---

**Twenty-Second Day: Evening Stroll at Tianjin Bridge; Next Day’s Poem**

Last night, an old man strolled to Tianjin,
Pausing often where the bridge stands.
The Luo River’s waters only hear the departing oars,
The west wind merely hastens the traveler’s steps.

Mountains and streams grow somber under cold rain,
Towers and terraces rise uneven, veiled in dusk’s clouds.
Who truly grasps this scene’s clarity?
When frost threatens, the wild geese arrive as guests.

---

**Twenty-Fifth Day: Responding in Rhyme to Wu Chuanzheng, Vice-Director of the Left Treasury**

The light and scenery of Shangyang are fine for reading,
Beyond appearances lies a level path.
A fair moon guides the return at Fragrant Grass Ford,
A swift wind flies past Dongting Lake.

Were it not for frequent journeys to the Red Waters,
How could there be daily joy in the Yellow Sprouts?
Do not say Tianjin Bridge holds no affairs—
Even in leisure, one must apply effort.

*(His poem said: "From now on, the scenes south of Tianjin Bridge / Shall not all belong to Shao Yaofu." Hence these lines.)*

---

**Twenty-Ninth Day: Responding in Rhyme to Lu Gangshu, Registrar of Luoyang**

A sudden shower, late rain’s rustling remains,
By Phoenix Tower, I chance to drive my cart.
Xie Shen’s jade fragment—who can hold it?
Le Guang’s blue sky—how fortunate it stays unobstructed.

Long parted through summer and autumn, what news?
By lamplight, what books do you read?
I regret having no silks to reward Master Cheng—
Vainly I fret and return to my humble hut.

---

*Yichuan Jirang Collection, Volume Five Concludes*
*Yichuan Jirang Collection, Volume Six*

**For Zhou Shiyan, Magistrate of Pu’an in Jianzhou, Written on Behalf of Shao Yaofu of Yichuan**

To serve as an official—why sigh for what use?
No ascent to heights but begins in humility.
The noble man’s bending and stretching is the Dao itself;
We Confucians prize advance and retreat as circumstance allows.

Even now, where is Pengze’s return?
Yet the eastern gate’s departure may still come in time.
I grieve that the scenes of Yi and Song remain boundless—
A single name, a fine place, yet I seek further emolument.

From Shu to the Three Wu, the distance spans ten thousand li.
Last year, I gazed north; this year, I drive west again.
Jian’ge scrapes the sky and sun;
Qin’s plains bar the imperial capital.

Facing the wind where we recall each other—
Could you drink a cup with me?

---

**Another Quatrain**

Just when elders should gather in fellowship,
The high autumn arrives, desolate and bare.
A handful of yellow blossoms, a flagon of wine—
A year has passed since my old friend went west.

---

**In Response to Secretary Zhao Chongde’s Gift**

People say official life endangers cap and crown;
I cherish my life, far from market and court.
My rustic face cannot bear rushing to the Wei gates;
My idle self is fit only to visit Yang and Liao.

Though my poems lack discipline, a thousand verses remain;
Though rich in clouds and mountains, I have but a gourd of wine.
I dread the carriage’s eastward departure—
From now on, how can I summon the wind and moon?

---

**In Response to Director Wang Buyi’s Gift**

For twenty years I have dwelt in Luoyang,
Watching the world’s affairs swirl like dust.
My form is no more than grass and trees, wild and untrammeled;
My heart resembles an ancient bell or tripod, empty yet resonant.

I have bathed in the benevolent breeze to my very marrow;
Now I marvel at the poetry’s brilliance, like jade and jewels.
Do not let Zhuang Zhou say names and realities are flawed—
It is simply that I lack talent and delight the crowd of monkeys.

---

**In Response to Professor Wei’s Gift**

In this pure age, literature hangs like sun and moon;
Though talentless, I am fortunate to enjoy abundant years.
I wander Mount Tai’s Greater and Lesser Chambers;
I gaze upon the Yi River and the Luo.

Of old, Mencius found enlightenment hard to speak of;
In this age, without Yanzi, who is deemed worthy?
Each time I read to the root of heaven,
I fear the masters will ask of the profoundest mysteries.

---

**In Response to Vice Minister Wu Chongqing’s Gift**

Non-being and being are the ancestral homeland,
Yet all things differ by a hair’s breadth.
Every person may reach it, though I have not;
No thing obstructs—who could hinder whom?

Lost, liver and spleen become Chu and Yue;
Gained, coarse greens become fine millet.
A single word, through the ages, is hard to fathom—
Its wondrous workings must be seen at Lüliang.

---

**In Response to Instructor Sun Chuanshi’s Gift**

South of Tianjin Bridge stands my humble hut,
Where you, my lord, deign to visit by carriage.
Since retiring, I have forgotten restraint;
From long idleness, my learning has grown hollow.

Better to inscribe my name in history’s annals—
Or should I bear plain books and face the clouds and mountains?
A single piece of sincere devotion is hardest to describe;
Perhaps I may yet resemble the Red and Void.

---

**In Rhyme for the Longevity Snow Gathering with Academician Chen Chengbo**

The garden’s flowers renew in a single night;
Jade Terrace’s twelve peaks turn to dust.
In the city, bamboo-leaf wine surges in price;
At the feast, willow catkins vie to learn spring.

The Liang Garden gathering draws all the inked guests—
Who recalls the divine beings of Guye?
My surplus grain need not fill a thousand granaries;
Even a foot’s depth of snow should not be spurned for its frequency.

---

**In Rhyme for the Garden Gathering at the Historiography Bureau, Composed on the Spot**

Bamboo reaches high, pines encircle the pavilion—
Who comes here feels their bones and hair grow pure.
Plum branches, laden with snow, barely crack open;
Water veins, linked to ice, murmur in their flow.

The year’s end in late winter stirs inescapable feeling;
Half-drunk, my sleeves cannot contain my emotion.
Who pities the late Chancellor’s empty name?
How can our Dao be put into practice?

---

**On Zhang Xian of Kuixia’s “Remembering the Past at Baidi City”**

No need to resent Cao’s rise in Xuchang—
Had it not been for Liang and Yi, none could contend for the throne.
The realm divided, wind and thunder raged;
Cutting across the southwest, his might was unmatched.

Travelers come and go, idly pointing;
Historians praise and blame in their reckless prose.
Later generations fail to grasp the meaning of rise and fall—
Look upon the old battleground in the river’s heart.

---

**Leisurely Verses, First Year of Xining (1068)**

Fortunate is the scholar who lives in a flourishing age,
Whose home, though tiled, lies in the central capital.
Fleeting fame and hollow profit are not mine;
Green waters and blue mountains—where are they not found?

To choose a fine site, seek the fairest scenes;
To choose companions, select those who suit you.
Joy in idleness is the idle man’s affair—
Yet it differs from stealing moments of leisure.

---

A six-foot frame, content in the present;
How can I bear to waste the four seasons’ fair days?
In the second and eighth months, the weather shifts between warmth and chill;
With three or five friends, we discuss the Dao and righteousness.

Measure your strength in cups and plates, set out simple fare;
Open your heart to laughter and speech, follow nature’s truth.
I urge you: in such clear and idle matters,
Though old, why grow weary of their frequency?

---

Do not let true qi aid sorrow and grief—
The indignant death of heroes only lengthens the age.
Though many horses leap on the paths,
Beyond the heavens, phoenixes soar.

Three thousand guests may polish their jade edges;
A hundred and two mountains may bear sword points.
All is but a spring dream passing—
What else is worth lamenting?

---

**Awakening from Sleep by the South Window, Gazing at the Spring Mountains**

Waking from sleep by the south window, I gaze at the spring mountains—
Amid the mountains, mist and sleet mingle with haze.
A thousand li cannot escape the clarity of these two eyes;
In a hundred years, I have not seen a single idle man.

Emotions are like falling catkins, without high or low;
The heart is like wandering silk, drifting to and fro.
I fear the hidden birds know this feeling—
Thus they come to the branches, murmuring softly.

---

**Who Has Entrusted Creation to the East Wind?**

Who has entrusted creation to the east wind?
Once given to the east wind, affairs know no end.
Late winter should prepare its plans;
New Year’s dawn must demand its achievements.

Willow tips, warmed, sway gently;
Plum buds, stealing spring, half-reveal their red.
If only the feelings of those times remained—
Light robes fluttering amid the carefree young.

---

**Peach and Plum Verses**

Peach and plum, stirred by the wind, fill the branches with blossoms;
Stirred by the wind, peach and plum scatter apart.
Sorrow and joy follow one another, never leaving my grasp;
Worry and delight both reside in my brows.

When prosperity reaches its peak, it must decline;
When adversity reaches its nadir, it must turn.
Let men of today cease to praise the ancients—
It is only because men of today were born too late.

---

**Heartbreaking Song**

I know not what iron was forged into this needle—
Once forged, it pierces only the heart.
I reckon the human heart is no more than an inch—
When piercing, it must pierce to the fullest depth.

---

**Lament for Two Younger Brothers Who Passed Without Illness**

The love between siblings runs deep, unforgettable;
Even cutting out my heart cannot compare to this grief.

**In Times of Urgent Need**

In times of urgent need, you once aided me—
Yet now, who stands beside me in this hour?
The radiant *di* flowers bloom without peer,
While geese in flight break rank, their formation torn.

From this night of moonlit winds and clarity,
I gaze in desolation at the eastern fence—my heart breaks.
My two brothers lie buried beneath its boughs;
Later, I found his poem from the Double Ninth:
*"Clothes white as the moon of yore,
Flowers yellow as the years before."*
I sought to ask the eastern fence of its tale,
But the fence’s tale had faded into mist—
A language like an omen.

Where now to seek the eastern fence, my heart undone?
From this day forth, its story sinks into silence.
Where once we walked abreast, all has passed away;
No sorrow now compares to this.

Tears have dried, yet grief knows no bound,
Though the Yellow Springs lie not so deep.
How many days must pass ere it fades—
Thirty-two years of harmony and kinship?

---

**Another Poem**

My elder brother named *Yong*, my younger *Mu*—
Brothers in harmony, yet was our bond enough?
In daily life, one always stayed behind,
Serving our parents, raising children as they wished.
Our kind father lived to seventy-nine,
Four young sons ever at his side.
Do you recall the days we played in bright robes,
While joy filled the hall, so full it could be cupped?

Two years ago, our father suddenly passed,
And this year, your life was cut short too.
Now a lone son attends our mother with four young ones,
Each day facing the ancestral altar, weeping face to face.
How many *li* of intestines must I have,
How many *hu* of tears must I shed?
All spent, all shed—what can I do?
The sunlight of past kindness—how can it be repaid?

---

**A Quatrain**

The bond of siblings runs deep,
The joy of *xun* and *chi* long.
To know where it may be forgotten,
See the weeds upon their graves.

---

**Hearing the Cuckoo, Thinking of My Deceased Brother**

I recall last year’s early summer,
When we listened together to the cuckoo’s cry.
This year, the cuckoo returns again—
It is still the same early summer as before.

Even birds know the depth of human longing:
One cry has not ceased before another begins in sorrow.
My heart, following this sound, is already broken—
My soul, chasing this bird, where does it fly?

---

**Inscription for My Deceased Brother Zan**

After my coming, before my going.
At the moment of departure,
There was no yielding between us.

---

**Evening Stroll South of the Southern Garden, Thinking of My Deceased Brother**

South of the southern garden, grass like a mat,
I walk at dusk, the wind clear, no dust in sight.
Unable to share this joy with you,
I wonder if the clouds above are drifting from heaven.

A fleeting piece of this world, come to be human,
Drifting to and fro without cause.
I pity myself—

---

**Self-Compassion**

Heaven covers all without partiality, ancient and modern the same,
Yet the deep bond of siblings is suddenly emptied.
Five or seven years of family hardship,
At sixty, my head winds still afflict me.

Common sense cannot escape worldly customs,
Private plans are hard to entrust to servants.
If only the immortal’s old raft still remained—
The Yi River’s clouds and waters bring boundless joy.

---

**Self-Admonition in the Year Wushen**

Though old, I still long to sing and beat the pot,
Hoping to preserve some measure of Heaven’s harmony.
*Ming Yi* advises concealment—let it end here;
*Wu Wang* warns of calamity—what can be done?

Time flies like an arrow from my head,
Human affairs pass before my eyes like hemp.
If I do not take charge of myself now,
The losses to come will be even greater.

---

**Written on Behalf of Zhao Chongdao, Envoy to Beihai, in the Second Year of Xining**

Since I ceased my recitations,
I have but sung one vast song to the wind.
Parting is easy, reunion hard—my longing knows no end;
Ascending heights, gazing afar—what thoughts arise?

A hundred years are fleeting, time does not return,
A thousand *li* of longing bring even more cares.
Today, this cup is truly the North Sea—
How many like you, so refined, have passed through?

---

**Matching Rhymes with Wang Buyi, Minister of Rites, in His Gift**

I do not let sorrow burden the splendor of things,
Time flies past my eyes swift as a chariot.
Finding joy in contentment, I know my place;
Seeking sufficiency for peace—when will it end?

After meals, I sometimes wander the orchid garden,
After sleep, with nothing to do, I visit the monks.
The wind and moon of Tianjin surpass other places—
I long to share tea with you there.

---

**The Virtuous One’s Song**

The virtuous are hard to find, their thoughts steadfast;
In peace, take care not to presume you are unharmed.
Vying to be first on the path—how treacherous the schemes;
Lingering behind in speech—how rich the flavor.

What tastes sharp often breeds illness,
What pleases the heart often brings misfortune.
Better to seek medicine before falling ill
Than to seek it after the disease has struck.

---

**Two Poems: Inviting Guests to Wine as the Early Plum Blossoms Bloom by the Eastern Pavilion**

**I**
I love the early plum more than the winter plum,
A few branches blooming first, lingering in the sun.
If all on the southern ridges had faded before the year’s end,
How could Luoyang boast its blossoms in the new year’s turn?

Fragrance follows the warm wind, emerging from the valley,
Beauty drifts upon the wine, floating in the cup.
Gather noble guests to grasp the Lord of Spring’s intent—
Do not waste this moment of spring’s arrival.

**II**
Spring’s warmth fills Luoyang,
Do not refuse joy to console this fleeting life.
Deeply cherish wise friends who bring smiles,
Treasure the plum blossoms shining bright before your eyes.

Moreover, the old mountain hermit is somewhat fond of such things—
How pitiful the fragrant wine, so full of feeling!
If not drunk before the cup now,
When else to drink to peace?

---

**Long Chant of the Pure Wind**

In the cosmos, the qi of harmony—
Pure and cool, beyond compare.
With the seasons, it dispels illness,
For the year, it brings abundant harvests.

Rising from the tips of green duckweed,
Coming from beside the emerald trees.
On a moonlit night, it meets me,
Then enters the land of old friends.

Dense leaves sway like layered curtains,
Lush flowers dance in bright adornment.
Two or three distant flute notes,
A thousand strands of drooping willows.

Silken zither notes drift softly,
Deep orchid fragrance lingers long.
Pavilions stand by distant waters,
Terraces near tall bamboo groves.

In midsummer, it drives away the heat,
After rain, it brings the evening cool.
Lightly parting green lotus leaves,
Gently penetrating thin robes.

Waves stir sleeves in playful flight,
Ripples rise in glistening cups.
Idle sorrows cannot cling,
Hidden thoughts take flight.

Swift as riding the heavenly steed,
Sobering as sweet sugarcane juice.
Before me, I wander Penglai,
At my seat, I drift the Xiao and Xiang.

Cannot be bought with gold,
Nor measured by the *dou*.
Relying wholly on virtue,
Stored without need of granaries.

No fear of monopolies,
No worry of bandits or thieves.
Making this my joy,
I have never known sorrow.

---

**Long Chant of the Weeping Willow**

Weeping willows come in two kinds—
Some long, some short in their droop.
Only this long kind,
Is most fitting for quietude.

**Long Chant of the Weeping Willow**

Deep in courtyards after spring’s retreat,
In pavilions when evening scenes unfold.
Too frail to bear the mist’s thick shroud,
Helpless before the lingering sun’s delay.
A drizzling rain has just passed,
A crisp, cool breeze now stirs.

By Zhangtai Street, east and west,
Pillars stand where avenues divide.
Rising eyes meet trees beyond the wall,
Brushing heads, branches cross the path.
Swaying like green silk ribbons,
Drifting as if clad in golden threads.
Tossed and scattered, sunlit catkins fly,
In warm winds, tender strands dance bright.

Threads tug at hearts, inch by inch they break,
Catkins drift into ten thousand homes.
Graceful as Wang Gong’s bearing,
Supple as Zhao Feiyan’s sway.
Slender and fair as young Zhang Xu,
Soft and delicate as Shen Hou’s frail frame.
Lush and trailing, green sweeps the earth,
Feathery and fine, jade fringes the pool.

Enhancing blossoms’ fiery glow,
Enticing grasses’ lush verdure.
Dense, they shroud the mountain lodge,
Sparse, they frame the tavern’s banner.
Given to others, all weep in turn,
Horses neigh as riders pause to gaze.
Shadows swallow the creaking cart,
Beneath their shade, wheels rumble home.

Mournful in the gathering dusk,
Faint in the slanting light.
Vexed by careless plucking,
Grieved by weighty partings.
Prematurely withered, green lines the road,
First to flourish where streams run near.
Beyond the tower, cicadas just begin their cry,
By the bridge, orioles sing again.

Hating how they block the distant view,
Loathing how they mimic painted brows.
Wandering strangers, countless in number,
Which long branch once bound whom?
Frost-withered, all grow gaunt,
Yet next year, they’ll sway anew.

---

**Long Chant of Falling Flowers**

With wine, I battle flowers’ lushness,
Flowers’ lushness makes the wine run deeper.
Flowers fade in ten days’ time,
Yet not a hundred jars of wine are drained.
Still gladdened by petals clinging to sleeves,
Still cherishing those fallen into cups.

Only butterflies are truly passionate,
Bees are but fickle lovers.
Diminished, the radiance on the wall,
Enhanced, the crimson along the path.
Scattered through the deep courtyard,
Adorning the quiet lattice.

Yet I fear they’ll follow the flowing stream,
Still dread they’ll wed the distant wind.
Water flows, ever winding,
Wind blows, now east, now west.
Tattered after late spring’s end,
Scattered in the fading light.

Though pavilions have their masters,
No trace remains of galloping steeds.
Swords depart with favored consorts,
Armies besiege Shi Chong’s halls.
At Mawei, lingering regrets,
At Jingu, all is haste.

Cao Zhi’s verses grow ever poignant,
King Xiang’s dream has reached its end.
Falsely they speak of seeking the Luo River’s shores,
Idly they tell of counting Wu Mountain’s peaks.
Swallows still voice their grievances,
Orioles fail to carry messages.

If moss-coins could buy them back,
Willow threads might mend their fate.
Gazing in vain at the true arbiter,
Mournful, I rail at nature’s craft.
Let them bloom in wild abandon,
Never granted even a moment’s grace.

My heart resists the sweeping broom,
Words fail, my plans are spent.
Exquisite fragrance consumes the marrow,
Peerless beauty slays the hero.
Boast all you like of turning heaven’s will,
Vaunt your world-conquering deeds.

Yet time, once gone, cannot return,
Events, once past, are never repeated.
Blooming and fading stand opposed,
Rise and fall share the same principle.
Those who grasp heaven’s workings but shallowly
Cannot escape this restless longing.

---

**Long Chant of Fragrant Grass**

Let fragrant grasses cease to grow,
Let fragrant cups no longer pour.
If grasses grow without end,
How could the cup ever pause?

After rain, in idle pavilions,
Deep in spring, in small courtyard courts.
At this hour, curtains hang half-raised,
In this moment, wine just sobers the mind.

Tender shoots spread thickly,
Soft green already takes shape.
They soften the last pale rays,
Summon the light chill of dawn.

Quietly gracing the flowered village,
Idly adorning the bamboo grove.
By the stream, gentle waters lap,
On the plain, spring plowing has not begun.

Let not perfumed carriages trample them,
Forbid fine steeds to tread here.
Lying upon them, endless thoughts arise,
Gazing long, emotions overwhelm.

From distant terraces, brows first knit,
From lofty towers, eyes suddenly brighten.
Low, the evening clouds stretch blue,
Faint, the distant mountains fade to green.

Emerald meets the mandarin ducks’ shore,
Lush connects the willows’ isle.
By riverside piers, night sails drop,
On sea islets, evening boats lie crosswise.

A single tune from the garrison’s horn,
A few notes from the herdboy’s flute.
On sandy banks, a pair of egrets descends,
At the ferry, startled geese scatter.

Lush and dense, they cover the march’s route,
Tender and thick, they line the envoy’s path.
Far and wide, they spread along the roads,
Encircling every short and long pavilion.

Fading, the tomb of Qin’s First Emperor,
Scattered, the city of Han’s emperors.
Desolate, the old Bronze Sparrow Tower,
Ruined, the former Golden Capital.

Mist veils the deeds of past dynasties,
Haze dims the names of later ages.
Withered, they still hide cunning hares,
Rotten, they yet breed fireflies.

Though mown, how can they ever be gone?
Scorched, they sprout anew.
Vainly they cloak the burial mounds,
Yet still they long for peace.

---

**Long Chant of Spring Waters**

Spring lingers where waters run clear,
Spring departs, and swimming ceases.
Clearness does not fall short of purity,
Yet spring surpasses autumn’s grace.

Purity found in sunlight’s warmth,
Clarity sought in the cold’s embrace.
A degree beyond mere clarity—
Thus purity is deemed supreme.

Thin ice begins to float,
Light rain just ceases.
Vast and boundless, new isles appear,
Glistening, old shores gleam.

Lotus and water-chestnut leaves still droop,
Cattails and reeds now sprout.
Water-shield and pondweed emerge,
Duckweed and water-milfoil not yet dense.

In warm sun, mandarin ducks bathe,
In misty clarity, kingfishers glide.
Waves calm, twin carp leap,
Wind still, gulls play in flocks.

In western Shu, outings vie in splendor,
In eastern Ou, purification rites are grand.
The Peach Blossom Spring is recognized anew,
The Han River’s girdle-pendants return.

Beneath terraces, waters flow smoothly,
Beside embankments, they wander endlessly.
Before railings, they barely ripple,
Beyond the sky, they stretch ever onward.

Overflowing, the heart grows troubled,
Murmuring, the mind turns deep.
Distant mountains cannot block their course,
Parting shores refuse to hold them back.

By the bridge in the second month,
At the wild ferry in the Three Wu lands.
As before, two oars lie crosswise,
Yet now they send a lone boat forth.

The painter lays down his brush,
The poet leans upon the tower.
Beyond the Yangtze’s flying catkins,
Only parting sorrows stir.

---

**Long Chant of Flowers and Moon**

In youth, I craved but two lines of verse,
All worldly joys seemed folly then.
Now I long to undo past regrets,
Yet how can my spirit match its former fire?

Each time flowers bloom and the moon waxes full,
What is this feeling that returns?
In such moments, without poetry or wine,
I would rather die than awaken.

When flowers meet the bright moon, their spirits soar,
When the moon sees rare blossoms, their radiance unfolds.
Man, flower, and moon become one,
And I feel this body roam the jeweled realm.

Yet I fear the moon may be veiled by clouds,
I dread the flowers may be torn by the wind.

If poetry and wine are not taken up again,
This moment will slip by, becoming but a fleeting guilt.
Fortunately, there remains a long poem to gather,
Fortunately, there remains a clear wine flask to hold.
When poem and wine flask are shared from time to time,
It is as if flowers and moon call to one another.
With flowers but no moon, the flowers age in sorrow,
With moon but no flowers, the moon resents its solitude.
The moon’s resentment can only be told through poetry,
The flowers’ sorrow relies entirely on wine to sustain.
When not a trace of moon’s resentment or flowers’ sorrow remains,
Only then does one know the skill of poetry and wine.
In such carefree leisure beneath the trees,
Who could fault this refined indulgence?

**Visiting the Shangqing Palace with Prefect Li and Academician Ge**
In Luoyang’s second month, spring sways and drifts,
Peach and plum bloom thick as marching screens.
High blossoms and low blossoms link in crimson,
While willows rise even above the highest flowers.
Leisurely accompanying the Prefect beyond the city gates,
We sought the true palace on Mang Hill.
No longer seeing the imperial procession’s western journey,
I stood in the wind all day, lost in melancholy.

**Begging for Bamboo Flute-Plants from the Estate of Minister Li Shaobao**
Wildly planted, idle flowers claim the earth,
Never deigning to linger with ease.
Yet how can one not love their frost-defying integrity—
Or the name still carved upon the flute?
When the phoenix arrives, they will bear fruit,
Where the dragon’s song is learned, can there be no sound?
This recluse begs for a few stalks to plant,
To gain honor from your noble house once more.

**Chant of Longing for the Mountains**
Behold the green mountains and white clouds,
Yet ponder the boundless merit they hold.
Who knows the joy they bring, and for what reason—
Is it merely to sate hunger with herbs?
A thousand clumsy poems fail to express my grievance,
A single cup of fine wine harbors spring anew.
How vast the days and months within the flask—
How many generations in the red dust grow old?

I fear the body may be idle while the heart is not,
Yet if the heart is idle, why dwell in clouded mountains?
If truly at ease in nature’s embrace,
Who would bury themselves in profit and strife?
My actions require no caution, no taboo,
My words need no artifice, no schemes.
Who could have imagined joy would reach such heights—
A heavenly steed leaves no trace, coming and going as it pleases.

**Chant of Resenting the Moon**
It is not that I begrudge gold,
But that Chang’e loves inconstancy.
Just before her ascent, she drips with dew,
No sooner full than the sky darkens.
I lean on the railing again and again,
Pouring fragrant wine, then pouring once more.
If only I could confine her in the women’s quarters,
Yet how deeply she has misled me, before and after.

**Chant of Sorrowing for Flowers**
Three thousand palace ladies in their robes,
Each hoping for favor, each lovely in her own way.
At first bloom, they seem delicate,
Half-opened, they become alluring and rich.
Before the heartwood reveals itself, fragrance already spreads,
As dew-laden powder falls, the soul melts away.
Facing such a fragrant cup, how many thoughts arise—
Yet soon wind and rain will ride roughshod over them.

**Matching Zhang Ziwang’s “Viewing Flowers in Luoyang”**
Creation has never failed mankind,
Myriad reds and purples reveal heaven’s truth.
The city teems with carriages and horses in vain chaos,
For not all who meet spring truly grasp it.

**Short Chant on Falling Flowers**
The garden’s peach and plum scatter in disarray,
Further torn by a wanton wind.
Ever sorrowful when they first fade,
Yet one must recall their unopened beauty.
Alas, how swiftly crimson splendor fades,
Unlike the slow change of green shade.
Ninety days of spring have all but gone—
How can I bear to furrow my brow before the cup?

**Short Chant on Fragrant Grass**
By flowered banks and waters, green as a mat,
Rising and falling through Han and Qin.
Claiming endless land across mountains and rivers,
How many through the ages have grieved for them?
Though severe frost kills, rain revives them,
Though wildfire burns, spring returns.
Yet why does this plant thrive so abundantly by the road?
Farmers forever weary of its encroachment.

**Short Chant on Weeping Willows**
By the stream, brushing the water, they sway,
Further tossed by the relentless wind.
At dusk, they cannot bear the thickening mist,
In deep spring, they chafe at the lingering sun.
Whose ethereal green silk scarf flutters?
Where do the golden-threaded robes dance?
Still fearing the parting lover’s heart is not yet broken,
The sky fills once more with scattered blossoms.

**Short Chant on Spring Waters**
Snow melts, ice thaws, filling the channels,
Kingfishers and mandarin ducks revel in autumn’s pride.
Ever resenting distant mountains that block the view,
Yet doubting if the branching stream can detain them.
Willows along the bank brush lightly,
New reeds by the shore sprout tenderly.
Endless misty waves fill the eyes—
The Three Wu regions send forth a lone boat.

**Short Chant on the Pure Breeze**
The pure breeze’s vigor has not yet fully waned,
Who says heaven’s heart has cast it aside?
Ever steadfast in fasting and solemnity while studying the *Yi*,
Ever ashamed of my carefree ways when composing verse.
The world’s fine scenes all pass before my eyes,
The age’s idle sorrows never touch my brow.
Born in an era of peace, untroubled by strife,
I grow old in these peaceful times.

**Late Spring Letter to Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar**
Year after year, I dread the deepening spring,
For each time it deepens, my illness cannot bear it.
A small gathering leaves me wounded by wine,
The weather for tending flowers favors light shade.
The years change as they always have,
Yet the seasons cannot turn back an aging heart.
Only the front pavilion is fit for quiet sitting,
Where I face the wind and long for old friends.

**Early Summer Leisure Chant**
In the depths of green willows, orioles trill,
Their songs still able to delight in peace.
Is it not fortune for one to enjoy long years?
Does heaven not feel for the rare treasures it creates?
When peonies fade, purple cherries ripen,
When peonies bloom, the *ban* orchids flourish.
In the grove, a kind of idle wealth and honor—
Why should I yield to dukes and ministers?

**Letter in Reply to Judge Yao Fuzhou and Section Chief Zhou of the Kaifeng Prefecture**
The ways of the world often thwart our wishes,
To speak of advancement is to know nothing.
Better to ponder idle matters at leisure,
Than to debate endlessly on West Street.
Even with extraordinary talent to move the world,
Alas, my temples are already silvered.
The new moon on the horizon has always been slender,
Not for the sake of painting brows in the human realm.

Your letter says: *"I hope you take care of yourself, for I fear the woods will not long hold you."*

**The Yi River’s “Striking the Earth” Collection, Volume Seven**

**Written on Behalf of Shao Yong of Yichuan to Zhang Duhuan, Prefect of Haozhou**

Much ashamed, I too have found no kindred spirit—
Though the music of heaven is heard, it permits no pursuit.
Master Hui’s political acumen was naturally keen,
While Zhuangzi’s wanderings held profound intent.
In leisure, I briefly record the events of a spring;
In old age, my thousand-mile aspirations falter.
Among the friends of the Luo Society, when we meet,
Recite for me the *White-Haired Lament*.

**Three Responses to a Villager Declining Office**

Through life, I’ve done nothing to furrow brows—
The world should have no one who gnashes their teeth at me.
Why waste rain to hasten the fall of blossoms?
How could spring be needed to adorn old things?
Fortunate to live under Yao and Shun as true sovereigns,
I let the recluses Chao and You remain outer ministers.
A sick man of sixty should know his place—
No need for supervisory officials to press their appeals.

**Matching the Rhyme of Vice Director Wang Anzhi**

I fear my fellow villagers may not yet understand,
But once they know me deeply, what doubt remains?
In poverty, accepting salary is permissible;
In old age, taking office is hard to justify.
I have my forests and streams to settle my plain aspirations;
In death, my lack of talent will not trouble the imperial court.
If Xun and Yang had upheld our Confucian bounds,
They’d have spared themselves Han Yu’s critique of minor flaws.

**Matching the Rhyme of Liu Zhifang’s Gift**

The Creator’s craftsmanship holds profound intent—
Where I find joy is in the mountains and forests.
In youth, frequent illness kept me from seeking office;
In old age, lack of talent makes my heart unmoved.
By quiet waters, I walk amid flowers and moonlight;
In fragrant orchid breezes, I rest beneath pine shade.
At leisure by the window, I sleep at ease—
Wishing for enfeoffment or gold bestowed.

**Written on Behalf of Wang Shengzhi, Academician, Thanking Him for the Gift of Lai Stone Tea and Wine Vessels**

On Eastern Mountain lies a stone like jade,
Which artisans carve to hold wine.
You, sir, obtained it but cherished it unused,
And with great care sent it to this forest-dwelling elder.
This elder has always used clay cups—
Startled, he dares not lift it with his hands.
He sternly warns his children not to damage it,
Sealing it away to await a worthy friend.
Yet I know not when that worthy friend will return—
A man’s achievements remain unfulfilled.
The court first heeds the words of the concerned:
Today, none compare to the two barbarian foes.
The Han’s six commanderies were bounded by Liaoxi,
The Tang’s eight prefectures cut off beyond the mountains.
Beyond lie Gansha, Gan, and Liang—
The Central Plains have long been unable to reclaim them.
Why further bait them with gold and silk,
Burdening our people and hindering our arms?
Were it not for a bold strike from the court,
How could the frontier crush these decaying foes?
Drive them out past their stinking lands—
West through Yumen, north beyond the passes.
With the foxes beneath the city walls gone,
The wolves on the roads will scatter of themselves.
The sun blazes bright on the celestial thoroughfare,
While ominous vapors and shifting omens hide in dust.
Upon success, he refuses the highest rewards,
Returning his seal and gold greater than a peck.
Begging leave of the sovereign, he departs the capital—
His homeward saddle brushes the willows of Heavenly Street.
A thousand officials, like jade walls, block the road to detain him,
But he lifts his face, cracks his whip, and does not look back.
Villagers line the road to welcome the great prefect;
Drunk, he is borne by banners and gleaming brocade.
Alighting, he visits his ancestors’ graves and resumes governance,
Yet does not call at the yamen—only at the homes of kin and old friends.
Only then do I know this vessel has its time of use—
I shall offer it to you for long life.

**At Chongde Pavilion, Responding to Various Gentlemen on Silent Chan**

The vast sky races with the sun’s wheel—
Why trouble yourself to distinguish root from dust?
The roc’s ten-thousand-mile journey needs no carriage;
The crane’s three-thousand-year lifespan has its own spring.
Alchemy turns lead and tin to gold—yet it is false;
Painting a horse in ink seeks truth in vain.
Look upon this wind-whipped, freezing night—
Who stands firm at the gate?

**Leaning on the Railing of the Small Pavilion in the Celestial Palace**

This frail, six-foot frame, sick and weakened,
Fits the daily deepening of decline.
All the clarity I regret is in my heart—
Not a word can be entrusted before it’s too late.
Gold lies hidden in sand, yet one must sift to find it;
Jade is embedded in stone—how can one doubt?
This sorrow lingers in the autumn dusk’s west wind,
As I lean on every railing, unknown to others.

**Written on Behalf of Wu the Daoist of Yuntai Abbey, Huashan**

The central peak of Mount Hua soars five thousand *ren*,
Beneath it, the great Dao sees travelers come and go.
One glance back from horseback in those days—
A decade later, my dreaming soul still crosses the pass.
All my life, I’ve loved mountains, yet they never sate me;
From here, I’ve seen all the mountains under heaven.
To find another like Mount Hua is rare—
It lets a man while away his whole life in leisure.

**Written on Behalf of Zhang Wentong, Attaché in Chang’an**

No learning, no schemes—
My breast has long been empty.
My withered guts delight in wine;
My ailing eyes fear books.
By the Luo’s banks, wrapped in wind;
At Tianjin Bridge, after a light rain.
An old friend lies a thousand miles away—
Gazing toward him, what are my thoughts?

**Matching a Poem on Hearing Han Weigong’s Departure to Govern Yongxing, Passing Through Luoyang**

Aiding three reigns as Grand Minister,
His name endures through ages as a foundational merit.
He nurtured peaches and plums across the world;
He rode the winds and waves through half the seas.
In the tiger’s tent, the night’s chill steels his heart;
In the Phoenix Pool, warm waves leave his post still vacant.
The sovereign’s reign is in its prime, with Guo Ziyi at hand—
The lands of He and Huang are not worth attacking.

**Written on Behalf of Zhang Jingzhen, Salt Transport Commissioner of Baibo**

Autumn enters the mountains and rivers with majestic air—
I cannot bear this idle gazing in old age.
Our golden friendship weighs heavily on my endless thoughts;
The bonds of brotherhood stir endless feelings.
A half-finished game of chess passes the white day;
A single hairpin of gray hair tangles in the west wind.
Only you and your father have known me long—
Our pine and cassia hearts share the same hue.

**Written on Behalf of Zhang Taibo, Magistrate of Yinjiang**

I still recall that year sweeping our humble hut,
Brothers together at the start of our official careers.
A lifetime forgets the commonplace—
Yet a thousand miles still exchange letters as if face-to-face.
I know from afar that the winds and moon of Siming are fine;
The rivers and mountains are even more so in late autumn.
A single sail has not yet found time to fly free—
In vain, I see your father inquiring after me.

**First Signs**

To recognize the first signs is to be one of us—
Beware of lightly joining the world’s vulgar laughter.
Better to display clumsiness before the crowd
Than to jest in solitude.
A thousand strange flowers, in every form, yield to the eye;
One bright moon, a single wheel, always enters the heart.
With such moments, how could time be spent in vain?
I know the joy of being human.

**Western Pavilion in Late Autumn**

Around the railings, chrysanthemums bloom in unison;
Doors, windows, and pavilions are all fragrant.

**In High Spirits**

In high spirits, one cannot but sing and chant;
In times of joy, one again encounters abundance.
Deep autumn’s scenery is fittingly fine,
And in old age, sinews and bones remain roughly sound.
After drinking, why not ascend for a view?
Amid piled rosy clouds lingers the setting sun.

**Leisurely Stroll by the Heavenly Ford**

Within Luoyang’s walls, I roam freely east and west,
Twenty years of indolence now fully spent.
Old friends abound, their kindness warm and deep,
While the capital’s grandeur exudes ease and grace.
The pond, level, resembles rivers and lakes;
The woods, still, evoke mountain valleys.
No need for deeds to shake the world—
The joy of quiet dwelling is boundless.

**In Reply to Two Gentlemen of Chang’an, Zhang and Qiang**

Your poems surpass treasures of linked cities,
Yet my talent falls short of Mi Heng’s.
I thought my plight like the steadfast boat would never meet favor,
But now, to my surprise, I am honored with splendid robes.
After rain on Min and E peaks, their sharpness is revealed;
After frost on winds and moon, their clarity appears.
Ancients spoke of few who could respond—
Was the "White Snow in Spring" an empty name?

**Letter in Reply to Prefect Zhang of Huainan**

Seeking fish by climbing trees is surely futile,
But seeking roasted fish by following fish may work.
Better to refuse the great goblet while drunk
Than to seek fine medicine after falling ill.
Do not plant rootless lingzhi—why bother?
Peaches of immortality bear fruit without difficulty.
Your kindness runs deep;
A mustard seed’s honor is still honor.

**Occasional Verse**

The consummate master refuses imitation,
Yet to act otherwise is to abandon the golden chariot.
To claim nothing is difficult under heaven
Is to deny true men exist in the world.
Heaven’s will aligns with the times for good measure;
Human nature finds peace in contentment.
Between heaven and man lies but a hair’s breadth—
Beyond it, all is as distant as the Five Lakes.

**Letter to a Friend**

Two decades have passed since we parted,
Years like arrows—only sighs remain.
Though long separated by hardship, east and west,
We exchanged earnest letters before and after.
Homeland’s mountains and rivers live now in dreams;
Old friends and kin lie half in ruins.
When shall we recount those days again,
Laughing into the west wind as we crack open wine jars?

**Wind Blows the Leaves (Third Year of Xining)**

The wind blows the leaves, not the roots—
Beware of bitterly pleading your roots’ case.
The Son of Heaven’s old capital is pleasant to dwell in;
The Sage’s lesser affairs are too trivial to discuss.
In the land’s long years, immortals are companions;
In the nest of peace, wealth and honor abide.
Having traversed ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains,
Returning, I recognize my true self.

**Leisurely Stroll**

I often recall sweeping my humble hut in those days,
Never letting the three paths grow wild.
I wished to be the world’s dragon-slayer,
But would I read unholy books?
Understanding fortune and misfortune, I knew when to advance or retreat;
Seeing heaven and earth, I discerned near and far.
Once I grasped the Way’s circular nature,
Not a trace of idle vexation remained in my breast.

**Seeking the Azure Sky in Wu and Yue**

You rush to Wu and Yue to find the azure sky,
Unknowing it lies before your eyes.
To see it with open eyes is still flawed;
To seek it with raised head is without cause.
Yan Yuan was in his "like a fool" days,
Mencius in his "unmoved" years.
How to find time to wander the jewel markets,
Loving others’ pearls and jades while fretting over coins?

**Buying Divination to Resolve Doubts**

Buying divination is buying doubt—
With deep illness, what medicine can cure?
Dreams within dreams, layer upon layer of delusion;
Forests on beds, error upon error.
Liezi riding the wind still depended on something;
The boaster chasing the sun surely grew weary.
Much toil, yet no achievement—
I’ve trodden all the world’s idle paths.

**Drinking Before Flowers**

They say beyond things lie misty clouds,
But are misty clouds beyond things worth boasting?
If you make comparisons your joy,
Then freedom from care is the immortal’s home.
A century’s fleeting light cannot be detained;
Ten days of fragrance depart unchecked.
To drink with flowers is no betrayal of wine;
To face flowers without wine is to wrong the flowers.

**Strolling in the Rear Garden After Spring’s End**

Green trees form a canopy in the sun;
Yellow orioles converse in pairs.
The small channel shimmers freshly;
New bamboo stands in uneven rows.
Leaning on my staff, I chant idly for long;
With a child in tow, my steps slow.
The fine breeze knows my intent,
Blowing toward me again and again.

**Letter to Wu Chuanzheng, Vice Magistrate**

Your steadfast heart is rare in this world;
The events of that day, this year, are hard to trace.
Snow and frost, though never mild, are not unbearable;
Pines and cassia never change their hues.
Scholars of Luoyi still trust me;
Only you know the winds and moon of Tianjin.
My dreaming soul, unaware of Luoyang’s distance,
Still visits you as in days of old.

**Gardens and Pools of Luoxia**

The gardens and pools of Luoxia need no gates;
No need to seek spring in other grotto-heavens.
Even unrestrained wanderers cannot match the idle guest;
Who asks the owner when entering everywhere?
The smaller pavilions’ railings frame flowers’ beauty;
The overgrown terraces reveal scenes’ truth.
Empty fame has misled endless affairs—
Not all empty fame reaches one’s person.

**Dream of Visiting the Eastern City to Call on Yang Yingzhi, Magistrate of Luoyang**

Last night, a clear dream took me east of the city,
Where streams divided, paths ran straight.
It was like riding a raft on the Milky Way,
But without Yan Zi to verify my tracks.

**Letter to Former Luoyang Recorder Lu Gangshu, Secretariat Drafter**

When your term in Luoyang ended, you shook your robes,
How could dust defile your distant journey?
Fortunately, the Way meets with clear days and months;
With bright eyes, you should see old rivers and lakes.
Only the worthy know when to act and when to stop;
True men can bend and stretch.
Why not return with the receding waters?
The three Wu regions remain as they were before.

**Reply to One Requesting Green Reed**

Among praiseworthy grasses,
Do not rank it with mugwort and wormwood.
Lush and spreading, it resembles bamboo;
Its verdant hue suits autumn best.
At first rustling in wind and rain,
It stirs thoughts of rivers and lakes.
Though it serves no use in the world,
It offers this brief respite.

**Carefree Chant**

The Way is fundamentally level,
Yet few are willing to walk it.
Gaining the heart brings no rich flavor;
Losing footing means deep pits.
Without penetrating heaven and earth,
How can one understand life and death?
In this matter,
One must be sincere and clear.

**Human Life**

People lament insufficiency,
But what more is there to seek beyond sufficiency?
Though my life is not yet sufficient,
It is also free of care.
Harmony with heaven is nurtured with wine;
True joy is drawn forth with poetry.
Do not doubt that time will hurry you—
It hastens men to early gray.

**Preserving Harmony**

**Entering Peaceful Abode at Night**

At night I enter my Peaceful Abode,
At dawn I rise to drink Great Harmony.
Probing the spirit, I know the Dao is at ease;
Cultivating simplicity, I gain much from heaven.
Sun and moon submit to their ceaseless sway,
Mountains and rivers endure their endless carving.
Those who seek to be such as this—
When all is said and done, who are they?

**What Moves Men Deeply**

What stirs the heart so deeply?
One searches yet finds no trace.
The Two Modes ever rest in hand,
The myriad transformations no longer weigh on the mind.
Jade lies hidden within stone,
Gold is often found in sand.
Though clear, it defies all reason—
One must sink into profound reflection.

**An Impromptu Chant**

A hair’s breadth apart,
Yet a thousand mountains, ten thousand peaks lie between.
Though one may forget sleep and food,
One will not abandon the workings of the world.
Not that I demand perfection of others,
But how hard it is to speak of this!
The heart of heaven is not far—
Yet once far, there is no return.

**Each Time I Visit My Eastern Neighbor**

Each time I visit my eastern neighbor,
My eastern neighbor grows ever more earnest.
Since I come, I am always filled with shame;
When we meet, we are as close as kin.
Food and drink follow our preferences,
Even the children obey of their own accord.
In my homeland there is such joy—
Why seek further benevolence?

**Each Time I Pass the Eastern Street**

Each time I pass the eastern street,
The eastern street resents my late arrival.
All we do is idle chatter,
Unmindful of how freely we open our hearts.
I possess a thousand joys,
Others harbor not a single doubt.
Half-drunk on joyful wine,
It is not yet late, yet I do not return.

**The Noble Man in Fellowship**

The noble man in fellowship
Is never without caution.
The petty man in fellowship
Is never without fault.
Only this true joy
Should be cherished and treasured.
In later years, when clouds and waters grow distant,
It may be hard to find again.

**Heaven’s Two Qi**

Heaven possesses two qi:
One yin, one yang.
From yin’s error come serpents and scorpions;
From yang’s harmony arise phoenixes.
If only serpents and scorpions would die,
They would no longer bring calamity to men.
If only phoenixes would be born,
They would forever bring good fortune to the state.

**No Guest Can Alter Heaven’s Will**

No guest can alter heaven’s will,
Yet some provide provisions for thieves.
At midday, brawls are often seen;
In the sixth month, frost descends.
Books lie unread,
Food goes untasted.
Meals barely fill a jar,
Books pile empty upon the bed.

**Love of Life, Fear of Death**

To hate death and love life—
Such is the constant nature of past and present.
If men’s hearts could give rise to affairs,
The world would know no war.
Even grasses and trees flourish in harmony;
How could mountains and rivers not be at peace?
Why then is there no joy in plow and cup,
No celebration of peace?

**Releasing the Small Fish**

Tiny and frail, not worth keeping—
To lose this is to lose a life.
I release you to rivers and lakes,
Where you may swim freely, far from pot and cauldron.
Beware the nets that lie deep,
Take care not to mistake the hook.
The world is full of those who cook—
Do not let yourself become their dish.

**Matching Rhymes for Minister Tian’s Gift**

Each day I stroll my garden,
Where the pure wind costs nothing.
Amid the city, I find rustic scenes,
Beneath the bamboo, I play with flowing springs.
Though I see no cause for sighing,
Why not nurture my boundless spirit?
Yet I am ashamed before the scholars of the world—
Their words on the Dao have not forgotten the fish-trap.

**Begging for Bamboo to Make a Flute**

The people of Luoyang love to plant flowers,
While I alone love to plant bamboo.
Though our loves differ,
Our hearts are equally content.
Flowers bloom red for but ten days,
Bamboo stays green through the years.
Both receive the grace of rain and dew,
Yet only bamboo escapes the shame of frost and snow.

**Matching Rhymes for Secretary Wang Buyi’s Invitation to Drink**

Through hardship, I recall Master Fuqiu,
Yet my homeland offers ample delight.
Before the wind, I am startled by white hair;
After the rain, I welcome the new autumn.
Though my official ambitions are faint,
My joy in climbing heights never fades.
The world’s vain worries
Never reach my heart.

**Again Matching Rhymes for Secretary Wang Buyi’s Gift**

The weather turns cool and fine—
Where is there a place not fit for wandering?
On the day the wild geese arrive as guests,
The hawk’s ambition stirs in autumn.
Forgetting form, we revel all night;
One misstep, and a life is lost.
How many on rivers and lakes
Have yet to reach their journey’s end?

**Matching Rhymes with the Three Secretaries Wang Visiting My Humble Abode**

To be content is to find beauty in certainty.
In Luoyang, poetry has its society,
And verses flow like divine speech from horseback.
White-haired, our friendship runs deep;
Yellow chrysanthemums mark the season’s renewal.
To be visited warms the heart;
To feel shame is to know the Dao is not pure.
Amid the desolate western wind,
With leisure, I am half an ancient man.

**A Letter in Place of Writing to Censor Lü Xianke of Nanyang, Guardian of the Imperial Counsel**

Two cycles of stars and frost have passed since we parted,
Our rise and fall unmarked by word or sound.
In the groves, laughter and talk must return to me;
The world’s peace and peril should rest with you.
Before the Son of Heaven, you often speak boldly;
On Hundred-Flower Isle, you move with ease.
I wonder, on nights of white moon and clear wind,
If you recall the old fisherman of Yi River.

**To Attendant Wu Chuanzheng**

How lonely the wind and moon of Tianjin Bridge!
Like me, do you remember them after autumn’s passing?
Each time I rely on the clear waves to send my voice,
I wonder if it ever reaches the Eastern Capital.

**To Former Registrar of Luoyang, Lu Gangshu, and Collator**

Having completed your term in Luoyang, you return to Wu and Kuaiji,
A man of grand ambition, your aspirations yet unfulfilled.
When you reach the finest landscapes,
Raise your cup without hesitation and gaze toward Tianjin.

**Matching Rhymes for Censor Zhang of Huainan**

The courtyard wutong leaves half-yellow,
The chrysanthemums by the fence just receive the frost.
As evening approaches, my mood turns heavy;
I take up my wine and gaze southwest.
I gaze for you but do not see you—
Only the wild geese flying south.
Just as I think to send a letter,
A few lines form of their own accord.

**Written the Day Before the Double Ninth**

Lately, illness has left me speechless,
Longing only to drowse in drunken sleep.
New wine arrives just in time for the Double Ninth,
Fine blossoms greet the season of Little Spring.
I know my fate is meager, looming overhead,
And wish no more affairs would come before my eyes.
Only the setting sun over Tianjin Bridge remains,
The sound of water still murmuring as of old.

**On the Double Ninth, Ascending the Stone Pavilion (Three Poems)**

**I**
Human feelings, once seen, are many;
Worldly ways, long known, are familiar.
After the fact, one gnaws with regret;
At the loss of things, one guards against hindrance.
Muddy water must be settled and strained,
Dusty clothes must be shaken and brushed.
If one must discuss the helmsman,
Who is truly skilled?

**II**
Events arise in a moment,
Once past, they cannot return.
At the time, they seem deeply lovable;
Afterward, they are unbearable to behold.
Summer departs—no need to speak of heat;
Winter comes—then one discusses the cold.
If men could grasp this principle,
Worries and troubles would find no purchase.

**III**
On this year’s Double Ninth,
Leaning on the railing, the air feels slow.
Though clouds and mist have grown faint,
The woods have not yet wholly withered.

**Where Heaven and Earth Open Their Embrace**

Where heaven and earth open their embrace,
Mountains and rivers delight the eye.
I lean on every railing in vain—
Who understands this feeling?

---

**Matching Rhyme in Reply to a Friend**

A million armored troops stir the frontier dust,
The court’s commission is no light trust.
Though the barbarian’s schemes run shallow,
A true statesman’s loyalty must be pure.
On the frontier, songs of sorrow rise in anger;
In the groves, drunken toasts turn to bitterness.
I long to offer a single word of good counsel,
Yet fear my friend may not know me truly.

---

**An Occasional Verse**

Wealth and rank breed arrogance in men,
And human feelings shift with time.
Virtue does not scorn others—
Over time, hearts turn ever more toward it.

Virtue follows constant principles;
Wealth and rank know no fixed term.
When frost comes, the weeds wither,
But the pines and cypresses grow lush in snow.

Most men flock to the powerful,
Yet when their fire fades, they depart.
The noble man fares well in hardship—
Through long restraint, his bonds grow firm.

When the blaze dies, its power does not return;
When affection is steadfast, men do not leave.
Strangers may seem like kin,
While kin may seem like strangers.

What matters is the closeness of heart and deed—
In closeness, good and evil part ways.
Is there truly nothing of worth in the world?
Surely there are men beneath heaven.

Having seen the stench of the foul,
One must think of jade and stone burned together.
How can the temper of the times endure,
Ever like spring in Luoyang?

---

**Untitled Verse**

Once I did not refine things,
And was misled by them.
Now I do not refine men,
Yet am met with their anger.

The misguidance of things can be explained,
But human wrath is hard to appeal.
I admit my faults to others,
And they, too, forgive me.

---

**No Wine to Drink**

Since the new laws took effect,
I’ve often suffered from an empty jar.
Whenever guests and friends arrive,
We idle the whole day together.

If I must beg from others,
Even close kin have none to spare.
If I must pawn my clothes to buy wine,
How can this last long?

---

**Reading Tao Yuanming’s “Returning Home”**

Return home! Let me follow my true nature,
Though affairs are past, my intent feels new.
When did I not live in such an age?
Yet how rare to meet a man like this.

As dusk nears, I sigh at the gathering gloom;
Facing the flourishing, I rejoice in the trees’ joy.
Pity that six hundred years later,
Another idle man follows in his dust.

**Visiting the Zhang Brothers of Nanyuan and Staying Overnight**

Mid-Autumn’s weather, fair as one could wish,
I came to Nanyuan to meet the reclusive Zhangs.
Too fond of drink to leave while dusk grew late,
I slept amid the mist and clouds of Water-Crystal Hall.

---

**Touring Longmen with Wang Anzhi, Vice Minister**

By nature fond of seeking secluded spots,
I visit Dragon Mountain four or five times a year.
Whether coming or going, I keep no count—
No worldly gain could make me linger there.

For days we lingered, watching the Yi’s flow,
Then divined a night on Incense Mountain’s stone tower.
A cool breeze stirred thoughts of distant things,
And misty rain played with the high autumn air.

---

**Returning to the City, Again in the Same Rhyme**

In high spirits, I explored Dragon Mountain’s depths,
As if wandering through a painted scene.
Regretting no fine wine to match the view,
Just when I wished to stay, I could not remain.

---

**Another Poem**

Early autumn’s light rain brings a gentle chill,
I lean on the eastern pavilion’s railing.
Who would have thought, amid such misty haze,
The pine study would seem a painted scroll?

*(The Pine Study, home of Anzhi’s younger brother, lies west of the water.)*

---

**Inscribed for Minister Zhang’s Hermitage**

Having served as the Three Dukes and lived long,
He ranks first in human blessings and virtue.
Yet his thatched hut still recalls his lord—
Right before the Ten-Thousand-Year Peak of Mount Song.

---

**A Letter on Behalf of Cheng Zhengshu**

Your venerable father governs west of Sword Gate,
His filial joy a model for the world.
The Tang ministers’ grandeur is still clear today,
While Shu’s people revel in past prosperity.

Where the Begonia Isle’s oars once paused,
By Golden Wild-Goose Bridge his horse once stood.
I know he frets over the realm’s affairs—
Who else but you would not forget your lord?

---

**Year’s End, Self-Admonition**

Once my ambitions soared like autumn’s might,
Now, recalling them, I blush with shame.
All forced schemes end in petty toil,
While the true Dao, unattained, drifts far away.

In stillness, one’s essence is hard to hide;
In old age, books gain deeper savor.
At ease, I converse with guests,
Yet piled memorials mislead lords and nobles.

Fortunate to be seen with favor by the wise,
I heed not my wife and children’s complaints of gray hair.
How dare I compare to Zheng Zhen of Valley Mouth?
Or scheme like the youths of Shouling?

Cauldron’s dragons and tigers, neglected in guard,
Chessboard’s rivers and mountains, abandoned in play.
Awakening from a nap by the sunny window,
A few soft bird calls just cease.

The finest woods and springs are bought with verse,
The fairest winds and moons repaid with wine.
Three hundred and sixty days fly like arrows—
How could I let my heart sink into idle sorrow?

---

**Joyful Song, Fourth Year of Xining (1071)**

At sixty-one, my body is not yet frail.
I’ve lived through two generations—
How could this be called an early end?
Moreover, I am still hale,
And free from care or vexation.
Why should I not rejoice?
Fine days are not few.

---

**To Li Jingzhen, Grand Master**

By the flowers, a quiet couch for idle rest,
Beneath the bamboo, a bright window for solitary thought.
What need for words to proclaim “the house is at peace”?
The green birds in the grove already know.

---

**Reflections**

Snake’s head and lizard’s tail are not the same—
Killing many is deemed a merit.
The four seasons’ winds and moons are infinitely fair—
Do not let idle matters trouble your heart.

**To Qin Boming, Minister of War in Bozhou**

The land of Three Rivers lies at the center’s sun,
Its qi nurtures rare blossoms to royal splendor.
A connoisseur of fine flowers is not far—
And fine flowers, ungrudging, offer full fragrance.

For years, worldly affairs have piled up,
Why frown before the blossoms?
A thousand schemes turn hair to white—
Better to leave the heart unburdened.

Amid boundless winds and moons, so full of feeling,
Let rich wine flush your face.
Yet men create their own doubts and barriers,
Weighing gains and losses, setting more traps.

Though poor, I sleep late without harm;
Others may fret, but I am at ease.
Tempering worldly passions brings moments of joy—
And fresh poems still number in the hundreds.

Where the heart returns is where the heart is absent,
Yet when the heart is absent, where can it be found?
If absence of heart meant absence of affairs,
Why then does gold form in water?

---

**Wine Holding Flower Shadows**

Wine brims with crimson, filled with flower shadows,
Poured into the harmony of heaven and earth within my breast.
I love best that singular savor—
Half-drunk, I am one with the Great Beginning.

---

**Another Farewell Poem**

Qin’s First Emperor once unified the Nine Provinces,
Yet the Nine Provinces soon passed to Liu.
Let others boast of their brilliance—
They merely toil in vain, their hair turning white.

---

**Thinking of an Old Friend**

Though the winecup is full,
An old friend a thousand *li* away—what can I do?
Willows trail by the pavilion, their branches slender,
Flowers near the eaves, their fragrance richer.

---

**Thanking Professor Wang Pingfu for Tea and a Poem on Flower-Viewing**

The Grand Academician knows flowers well,
And in their essence, finds it through tea.
After brewing amid ten thousand reds’ fragrance,
He sends the finest to the Celestial Ford’s first household.

---

**Viewing Flowers at Nanyuan**

On the third day of the third month, flowers in full bloom,
I climb the spring terrace with kin and old friends.
Usually sober, now I am drunk—
And even drunk, I can still raise a great cup.

Before the flowers, I drink; before the flowers, I grow drunk,
Drunk, I grasp the flower branches and sing.
Let the flowers not laugh at this white-haired man—
The white-haired man has seen many fine flowers.

---

**Admiring Peonies Alone**

Viewing flowers is easy; knowing them is hard.
Only the connoisseur leans on the railing.
In rain and dew’s work, one sees creation’s art,
In immortals’ ranks, their beauty is fixed.

Common blooms may be called fashionable,
But only the extraordinary are deemed transcendent.
One’s allotted share is not shallow—
It takes a lifetime of leisure to deserve them.

---

**Asking Spring**

In the third month, spring departs and cannot be detained,
Spring’s departure—how can its intent be entrusted?
All who speak of returning must return home—
Where, then, is spring’s home?

Where, after all, does spring return?
Countless spring grievances remain unspoken.
I would entrust the warbler to ask the reason,
But the cuckoo cries, “Better to go!”

Spring comes, sorrow departs—all for the flowers;
Spring goes, sorrow arrives—then clings to wine.
Long resenting sorrow’s weight and wine’s weakness,
Does spring, now ill, know the flowers’ plight?

---

**Self-Admonition in the Peaceful Nest**

Things, when well grasped, end in beauty;
Affairs, when cunningly schemed, lack justice.
Not stirring waves in the world,
One keeps ice and coals from the heart.

**Disasters and Blessings**

Disasters fall like autumn leaves before the frost,
Wealth and honor bloom red after the rain.
Creation’s design is clear—yet none perceive it:
How much merit lies in withering and flourishing?

**Exhortation Before Flowers**

Spring lingers when drinking before the flowers,
But when spring departs, the flowers fade.
To face the flowers and not drink wine
Is to let joy dwindle away.
Drink wine before the flowers,
And view them best when drunk.
To not drink wine before the flowers
Is to waste a year’s delight.

**After Writing *The Supreme Principles Governing the World***

Simplicity scatters, and the human Dao is established;
Laws begin with the Sovereign Fuxi.
Years and months shift and change,
Yet records are hard to verify in detail.
The Two Emperors initiated abdication,
The Three Kings rectified the social order.
The Five Hegemons relied on strategic terrain,
The Seven States vied for supremacy.
The Two Han soared like dragons and phoenixes,
The Three Kingdoms fled like tigers and wolves.
The Western Jin indulged in refinement,
While rebels flocked to the northern wastes.
The Eastern Jin cultivated purity,
Passing its fragrance to Song, Qi, and Liang.
By the time of Chen, it was not worth reckoning—
The southern lands became a scene of sorrow.
Later Wei exploited Jin’s weakness,
Sweeping away chaos to bring brief peace.
Yet before long after moving to Luoyang,
Rumors spread of eastern and western generals.
Northern Qi raised its flickering torch,
Later Zhou raced like a shooting star.
Sui achieved unification,
Paving the way for mighty Tang.
The Five Dynasties passed like inns,
The realm plunged into turmoil.
Had no true lord emerged,
How could the center have been secured?
A domain of ten thousand *li*,
Four thousand years of rise and fall.
Five hundred sovereigns took the throne,
Seventy states carved out frontiers.
Some unified the Six Directions,
Others controlled but a single region.
Some founded dynasties early or late,
Others reigned briefly or long.
Some rallied as their rule crumbled,
Others seized power in their prime.
Some disasters arose without cause,
Some fortunes turned to misfortune.
Some perils came from outer defenses,
Others erupted within palace walls.
Some ailments stemmed from allies,
Others festered in vital organs.
Laughter and talk sowed strife,
Feasts and banquets opened battlefields.
A single outburst of desire,
A clash of profit and harm.
Fierce struggles led to devouring,
Endless calamities ensued.
Mountains and rivers barely marked the land,
Tombs and mounds soon lay desolate.
Brambles were hard to clear,
Orchids and irises failed to flourish.
Dragons and snakes slithered across the plains,
Jade and stone mingled on Kunlun’s slopes.
Those who planned well were called Zhou or Confucius,
Those who harmonized were deemed Lao or Zhuang.
Yet how can one speak of one’s own afflictions?
How can all cares be forgotten?

**Gathering to Drink in the Dao**

What the crowd delights in
Is but clamor and dust.
What my friends delight in
Is pure fragrance alone.
Pure fragrance needs no music—
It dwells beside the distant past.
The distant past holds no other secret:
Harmonious *qi* ever swirls.
In our village, old friendships thrive,
With talent and culture abounding.
A single day’s visit brings joy,
As if the tenth month birthed spring.
Luoyang, ancient sacred land,
Where the Duke of Zhou once expounded.
The four seasons keep their proper course,
The four directions lie equidistant.
Each generation has its heroes,
Known for their many scholars.
Even its flowers and trees
Are unmatched in the world.
To encounter such a scene,
At such a moment,
And to laugh aloud—
How many in the world can do so?
Pure hearts pierce metal and stone,
Lively discourse startles ghosts and gods.
Heaven and earth become a single finger,
Wealth and rank like floating clouds.
In prosperous times, one eases relief efforts,
By daylight, one leisurely weaves plans.
Better to join the Wine Immortal,
And once more face this noble one.
Six hundred *li* of Shang and Yu,
Forty thousand catties of gold—
Cannot buy this joy,
So how can lesser things compare?

**Tipsy Revelry**

When the fence is breached and hats are askew,
The toad in the moon leaps to the sea’s edge.
When the small cart is overturned,
One visits the mountains and returns to the Celestial Ford.

**Thoughts on Chen Zhimò of Zhengzhou, Moved by His Passing Without Ever Meeting**

Exquisite things must be peerless,
Extraordinary people must be rare.
If creation brings them into being,
It is surely no easy feat.
One may hear of them across ages,
Or see them in one’s own time.
Chen was a man of our time—
Why did I only hear of him by ear?

**To the Four Zhang Brothers of Chengnan, Who Braved the Snow with Wine and Food**

A drought had lasted nearly through winter,
The river guardian’s prayers went unanswered.
Then, like geese in formation, you arrived,
And suddenly a foot of fine snow fell.
Wine flushed your faces red,
Guests’ hearts swelled with boundless joy.
By midnight, you left Tianjin,
And Tianjin stood stark and silent.

**Chant of the Great Cold**

Old snow has yet to melt,
New snow piles against the door.
Before the steps, a frozen silver bed,
From the eaves, icicles hang like stalactites.
The pale sun casts no glow,
The fierce wind howls in fury.
Each person has a tongue,
Yet words cannot be spoken.

**Matching Li Shenyan’s Poem on the Great Snow**

A thousand trees of jade flowers bloom overnight,
Blending with heaven and earth in dazzling white.
The pale moon goddess dances with slender waist,
While deep in the white jade hall, another melody begins.
The scholar by the jarred window clutches his books,
The armored soldier on the battlefield moves in silence.
The reclusive man, his bones thin, nears emaciation—
Fortunate to have, now and then, a cup of wine.

**The Small Cart**

Why not drink a thousand days’ wine in joy?
Why not cherish the four seasons’ flowers?
Wherever the small cart rolls, people rejoice,
And all of Luoyang seems like home.

**Matching Rhymes with Ren, Fiscal Commissioner of Zhe**

On the official path, I found a true friend—
How could I lightly betray Luoyang’s spring?
Though three thousand *li* separate river and lake,
Let not our hometown friends yearn too often.

**Matching Song, Capital Official, Requesting Plum Blossoms (Fifth Year of Xining)**

Though my small garden has four kinds of plum,
None bloom before the twelfth month like those south of the river.
I long resent the East Lord’s lack of charm—
He refuses to release spring before its time.

**Writing at the Eastern Pavilion as the Yellow and Red Plum Blossoms Bloom, Presented to a Friend**

Once a year, we see the twin plums,
But how many times can we see them bloom?
At sixty of a hundred-year lifespan,
Cease idle talk and raise your cup.

**Matching Ren, Ministry Official, Recalling Plum Blossoms**

I grieve that plum blossoms fade so soon,
Once withered, they are too haggard to behold.
Year after year, their pure fragrance deceives—
Better to plant a few idle bamboos.

**Weeping Willow**

Before the gate, the weeping willow sways,
Tossed by the east wind’s comings and goings.
It forgets that I am already old,
Mistaking itself for youth.

**Chant of the Utmost Spirit**

The utmost spirit is called human,
The utmost nobility is called lord.
In brightness, there are sun and moon,
In obscurity, there are ghosts and gods.

**Chant of Humans and Ghosts**

If one cannot serve humans,
How can one serve ghosts?
Though humans and ghosts differ,
Their principles are never distinct.

**Lifelong Exchange**

Throughout life, in dealings with others,
Never once have I tasted bitterness.
I have never wronged another,
Nor have others ever harmed me.

**Chant of Knowledge**

What the eye sees is called perception,
What the ear hears is called knowledge.
Yet how rare in this world
Are true knowledge and perception.

**Occasional Verses**

In wind, the forest has no still branches,
On wind, the pond has no calm waves.
If forest and pond are never still,
What then of birds and fish?

**Chant of Anticipating Misfortune**

Servants bully their masters,
Barbarians invade the Central Kingdom.
Since ancient times, injustice has been known,
Yet none can ever wholly eradicate it.

**Two Poems Sent to Wang Xuanhui of Sancheng**

Though my forest dwelling is humble,
Before the flowers, I drink often.
In this world, joy belongs to those without affairs—
Yet I fear it belongs only to the idle.

Dust rises on the road to your chamber,
While in my pot, flowers just bloom.
Why wait until my hair is fully white
Before composing my homecoming verse?

**Chant of Benevolence and Sagacity**

To exhaust the Dao is called sagacity,
To be like heaven is called benevolence.
Yet how is it that benevolence and sagacity
Dare not be matched in this world?

**Matching Xing Heshu, Academician, Upon Parting**

How vast the world’s road stretches eastward—
We meet without needing words to convey.
You compare yourself to Zhuge Liang,
While I am no Yellow Stone Elder.

In expounding the Dao, high or low, no matter great or small,
In speech, rise and fall have their beginnings and ends.
Talent and achievement must be cherished in comings and goings—
Beware of lightly following the ways of Western Jin.

**Chant of Striking the Earth**

They say there are immortals in grottoes,
But tales of grotto immortals may be false.
If one awaits the ninefold elixir,
Or seeks the vermilion crest for a thousand years—

In the Land of Longevity, a thousand trees of flowers,
In the Nest of Peace, joy overflows.
With joy, flowers, and wine,
I doubt not that I am a grotto immortal.

**Chant of Spring’s Departure**

Fine things are hard to come by,
Yet all vanish in a few days.
First tossed by wind,
Then ravaged by rain.

The drunkard awakens from wealth’s stupor,
The dream of immortality suddenly fades.
The wanderer, unaware of when to stop,
Still leans on the crimson balustrade.

**Flowers and Bamboo in the Southern Garden**

Flower paths and bamboo trails press close together,
Each day I walk them four or five times.
I let the flower paths encroach on the bamboo,
That the bamboo trails may face the blooming flowers.

Fragrance drifts far, clinging to sleeves,
Bamboo shadows layer upon the wine cups.
Who says the mountain elder lacks warmth?
Such reds and greens ever embrace.

**Two Responses to Wang Xuanhui**

Our Confucians have their own joy,
Yet few are willing to follow it.
To take Chan as joy
Is but to raise another layer of dust.

**Again**

The greatly enlightened are truly unobstructed,
Each person has their own home.
Even false flowers occupy the mind—
What then can be called true flowers?

**Azure Chant: Sent in Reply to Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar of Caozhou**

The same hue, ever azure,
From ancient times to now, people gaze and cry out in sorrow.
Sun goes, moon comes, with little change,
Yang’s warmth and yin’s chill do not hinder each other.

After thunder’s swift crack, mountains and rivers split,
When sweet dew falls, grasses and trees grow fragrant.
In dark cliffs, ghosts and demons arise,
On clear plains, phoenixes appear.

A thousand flowers bloom in spring’s rain,
Ten thousand trees wither in a night’s frost.
This meaning is hard to fathom—
Only the worthy can enter its depths.

**Five Chants from the Forest**

The true artisan of creation allows no favoritism,
The clumsy schemer’s plans are ever slight.
After rising from my Nest of Peace,
Half-drunk on the rich brew of Great Harmony.

In the Land of Longevity, I go with basket in hand,
In the Land of Ever-Ripe Grain, I return with staff.
My body, like the age of peace, knows no trouble—
A few white whiskers let the wind blow as it will.

**Old Age**

The body of old age demands warmth,
In the Nest of Peace, spring is ever present.
All affairs leave the heart, free to recline or rise,
My four limbs obey me, stretching or bending.

Where garden flowers bloom thick, cool mats are spread,
When eaves snow flies, soft quilts are laid.
Who says the mountain elder is clumsy in use?
He too can nurture his own well-being.

**The Light and Pure**

There is a thing, light and pure, called Great Harmony,
Half-drunk, it best captures spring’s abundance.
Can the elixir of immortality truly change bones?
Can ascending to heaven in broad daylight be so?

When joy is full, I rise and dance,
At the point of forgetting words, I only sing.
Do not blame friends for my lack of restraint—
True joy assails the heart, and I cannot help it.

**Inviting Each Other**

We invite and urge each other to drink rosy clouds,
Hair tangled like autumn frost, temples streaked with blossoms.
What we recall are but past years,
Most of what we’ve experienced belongs to old officials.

Together we praise the grandson’s visit today,
Speaking again of old times.
Words are tender, full of feeling—
Let not the young laugh at our fussing.

**Born Without Tilling**

Born without ever tending fields,
Yet every year, every season, there is harvest.
With cups and plates as they come, all is joy,
Casual ponds and pavilions become excursions.

Wind, flowers, snow, moon—worth a thousand gold,
Water, bamboo, clouds, mountains—worth ten thousand households.
Awaiting the Yellow River’s clarity, how long can man live?
How much sorrow can the brows bear?

**Self-Admonition in the Nest of Peace**

I do not lash my whip toward the red dust,
Seeking only to reduce faults, yet still without means.
In vain, I recall the days of knowing my errors,
Mistakenly passing the years reading the *Yi* with Confucius.

When hair turns white, it’s hard to receive color,
When the heart attains thoroughness, what more is there to say?
The qi of utmost yang becomes jade—
Yet I fear the drilling and polishing are not yet firm enough.

**Two Poems Matching Junshi, Minister of the Flower Hermitage**

No need for cinnabar pillars or carved beams,
Layer upon layer, green shade naturally hangs.
Later generations, inheriting this natural intent,
Should not seek to add embellishment with planted shade.

Behind and before the hermitage, all is planted with flowers,
Blooming in turn, lovely in all four seasons.
The master’s affairs are simple, often at leisure—
He does not believe that the years can age him.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Eight Concludes*
*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Nine*

**At Sixty-Two, by Shao Yong of Yichuan**

At sixty-two, still hale and strong,
Death but returns me to the land of eternal ripeness.
Fair scenes and fine hours are not easily won—
What harm in sipping lightly and singing low?
Boundless years defy all constraint,
Frail flesh and bone must not be harmed.
How many heroes have wielded wit and skill—
Yet few have pondered deeply the ills they bring.

**Chant on the Game Beneath the Trees**

Even the idle have their duties,
And these four fill my days:
One, to greet dawn’s dew and watch the flowers;
One, to welcome evening’s breeze and gaze upon the willows;
One, to face the bright moon and chant poems;
One, to keep fine guests and pour the wine.
For twenty years I’ve lived thus—
Who among my peers could match this life?

**Matching Rhymes with Attendant Councillor Wu Chuanzheng’s Gift**

Fifty years spent poring over old books—
The world must think me dull and out of touch.
Yet I recall the weaver’s daughter, lost in time,
And grasp the wheelwright’s art of swift and slow.
My Daoist practice lacks refinement—this is my true flaw,
Though my livelihood is meager, I dare not call it vain.
In this age of harmony, I’ve received much—
How could my heart not rest in perfect ease?

**Poem for Academician Li of Yanfu Ward, Who Requested My Garden and Pond**

Nineteen times the banners of might were unfurled,
A family of meritorious generals through the generations.
In this peaceful age, you left glory behind to return home,
White-haired, passing the years in joy.
Cups brim with fragrant wine, afloat on spring waters,
New melodies rise from the depths of fair blossoms.
With such a garden, such a pond, such longevity—
Your descendants fill your eyes with boundless blessing.

**Chant on Gold and Jade**

Fine gold and fair jade are never paired by chance,
The finest things often lie buried deepest.
Robber Zhi wielded troops yet did no good,
While Confucius, landless, was met with suspicion.
If *zhongfu* demands trust to be true,
Why does *wuwang* bring disaster in its train?
Better to treat them as matters external—
The wellspring of the heart is joy, radiant and clear.

**Summer Day in the Southern Garden**

Summer trees, uncounted in their layers,
Cast deep shade where emerald leaves droop low.
A hundred birds call to one another—
Most are orioles, their voices bright.
**For Attendant Councillor Xie of the Southern Office, Who Sent a Vessel of Xi Yi’s Wine**

The peaks of Xian Zhang stand sheer, unyielding,
Since Xi Yi and Chen Tunan passed, none have matched them.
They poured with a hand raised high for worldly affairs,
Sipped with a tilt of the head for human feeling.
To paint a tiger and fail—yet the heart remains;
To mourn the qilin with no response—tears stream down.
But enlightenment comes without many words—
The first prize is to win this pure leisure.

**Matching Junshi, Minister of the Flower Hermitage, on Sitting Alone**

Sitting in stillness, nurturing the harmony of Heaven,
I have gained much from this practice.
Vast as a hall, yet dense with vines and creepers,
I forget the bearing of a noble minister,
And can welcome even rustic visitors.
Bound by the times’ joys and sorrows,
In the end, I know not what to say.

**Matching Rhymes with Capital Official Song’s Gift of a Palm-Leaf Whisk**

Luoyang has long been called a secondary capital,
Yet it has sheltered even one as unworthy as I.
Where countless mosquitoes hum like thunder,
How can a single whisk hope to sweep them all away?

**With Academician Wang Shengzhi, Admiring the Peonies of the Western Garden**

This flower is famed in Yangzhou,
But here by the Luo River, it is prized above all.
I know well its royal beauty can move all things,
And its heavenly fragrance binds men’s hearts in secret.
It crowns the host of blossoms, reigning through summer,
Holding its rare perfection without need of spring.
As the sun slants low, I mount my horse to leave—
Yet turn once more to lean on the crimson rail and gaze.

**Playfully Thanking the Wealthy Minister for His Gift of Banana and Bamboo Shoots (Three Poems)**

A renowned garden where not even crows may fly,
Yet now the Minister deigns to send for me.
Feasts from tripods have long been called wealth and honor—
Now he pairs them with flowers and bamboo shoots.

You send great shoots to startle me,
While my small garden yields none at all.
Though I’ve striven to temper my nature,
How can I remain unmoved today?

The work of responding to things lies beyond the world—
Who can force their way to such heights?
I am but a man who knows not his limits,
Seeking to heap molehills to match Mount Tai.

**In Reply to Li Xichun, Field Officer**

Though born in prosperous times, what can I do?
My nature and wit are too slight for great deeds.
My flawed disposition suits only the curling of the inchworm,
My meager talent dares not aspire to the flight of the roc.
Often I visit old friends, joy without end,
Or seek quiet places, returning late at dusk.
I love flowers best when half-open, touched by dew—
Yet how can I bear the dew that soaks my robe?

**Moss-Coin**

After each rain, it renews itself,
Not through frequent minting.
Though plentiful, it cannot be given to guests,
And if lost, no one suspects theft.
Covering the ground does not make one rich,
Filling the steps cannot relieve the poor.
To drown sorrow, one must have a cause—
To buy wine, there is no reason at all.
Scattered, it resembles counting rods;
Piled high, it seems a tangled rope.
Unable to aid one’s own urgent needs,
How can it spare help for kin?

**Chant on Sowing Grain**

Farmers sow grain in season,
Planting millet, not weeds.
Yet why, before the millet thrives,
Do the weeds flourish first?
If weeds are not uprooted,
The millet will never ripen.
Worse still, when both need water,
The weeds steal the nourishment meant for the grain.

**Matching Minister Junshi’s Gift**

I have never seen such clamor,
Even in the heart of the city, it resembles distant outskirts.
Though I lack a thousand-mile steed,
I have found a branch to nest upon.
The moon rises behind cloud-wreathed mountains,
The wind stirs the tips of pines and bamboos.
What have I truly gained?
Surely I need not shun the world’s mockery.

**Autumn Night**

Floating clouds disperse,
Stars and constellations gleam across the endless sky.
Green moss clings to crimson fruit,
Pure fragrance rises from white lotuses.
My body, still cool, wears linen,
My ears, now quiet, hear no cicadas.
Sitting long, all movement ceases—
The autumn sky is utterly still.

**On Revisiting My Garden in Autumn, I Take Up My Bamboo Staff and Don My Sable Robe—Both Gifts from Jingren—And, Seeing Them, Think of Him and Write This Poem**

The bamboo staff has long been my companion,
The sable robe, though spread anew, is still fresh.
Gradually it bears the snow of Min Mountain,
Brushing away the dust of the capital.
It steadies my steps on the drunken path home,
Fits my ailing body with ease.
Thanks to these treasures from my study,
At times I feel as if I see my old friend again.

**Clouds**

The clear sky is bluer than water—
How can a single cloud take flight?
Catching the sunlight, it becomes a vermilion phoenix;
Following the wind, it turns to white raiment.
Coming and going, it leaves no trace,
Hidden or revealed, it forgets all cunning.
Who can fathom Heaven’s principle?
In the end, where does it belong?

**Leisure**

In leisure, I observe all things—
Everywhere, there is freedom.
Fish are hooked for their greed,
Moths are scorched for rushing into flame.

**The Azure Wutong and the Phoenix**

The azure wutong starves the phoenix,
While white grains sate the wren.
Who is this rope-girt youth?
He sings as he gathers firewood.

**The Flowering Arbor’s Morning Glories**

The arbor blooms with morning glories—
At dawn they open, by sunrise they wither.
Though their flowers are fair, none linger to admire.
Gazing afar, clouds cling to the peaks;
Her makeup done, her kingfisher pins scatter.
A gauze pouch cradles the morning dew,
A jade parasol brushes the autumn mist.
Their longing is not like the sunflower’s,
Yet they fade before the hibiscus.
Fit only for a fleeting glance,
They waste the day in idle sleep.

**Matching "Autumn Night"**

Long I dreaded summer’s heat,
Now I welcome autumn’s night.
Sudden rain meets towering bamboo,
Cool winds sway the evening lotus.
How could withered sedge crickets
Outlast the failing willow’s cicadas?
If only I had a bird of the marsh,
Its clear cry would wash me clean.

**Matching "Sable Robe and Bamboo Staff" (Both Gifts from Fan Jingren)**

The noble man preserves all things,
Cherishing the old, not the new.
The staff grows from Shu’s rocky cliffs,
The sable runs through Yin Mountain’s dust.
It steadies treacherous paths,
Warms a frail and ailing frame.
Never set aside in motion or stillness,
It is as if I see the giver again.

**Matching "Clouds"**

The sky’s canopy stretches boundless,
A single cloud drifts alone.
It knows only to cling to stone,
Not to become heaven’s raiment.
Coming, it has no intent;
Going, it needs no device.
If it cannot bring timely rain,
Why return to the imperial realm?

**Matching "Leisure"**

Observe all things through the self—
Their principles are never distant.
Horses grow lean from too much riding,
Tortoises burn from scorching divination.
The parrot may speak, yet still be caged;
The wren eats its fill with ease.
The mist and waters of Yi and Luo are fine—
Would that I could share them with fisher and woodcutter.

**Matching "The Flowering Arbor’s Morning Glories"**

Leaves clamor thick as a cock’s crow,
Flowers bloom dense as kingfisher pins.
Dew glistens cold at dawn,
Mist veils the clear day’s haze.
Their blooms follow in ordered turns,
Yet open and close without sequence.
The master stands long in vain vigil,
Ever forsaking his morning rest.

**Two Quatrains to Old Friend Wei of the Three Cities**

Though aged, I am not yet feeble,
Chrysanthemums crowd my fence.
The weather turns crisp and fine,
Neighbors gather in good cheer.

The scene is fair, our bodies hale,
The sky clear, the road dry.
A light carriage on soft grass rides smooth,
Everywhere, pure delight.

**Autumn Day on the Stone Pavilion**

First clear skies, I lean on the monk’s pavilion rail,
The world grows bleak in the eighth month.
I test my strength on the uppermost floor,
Gazing from on high at the mortal realm.
Autumn deepens, the weather suits me well;
In old age, my heart loves only leisure.
I bid the distant mountains hold their hue—
Such feelings have long since faded.

**Matching Li Shenyan’s "Traveling Past Longmen"**

A thousand miles of autumn light fills my seat,
Our friendship rejoices in smiles of welcome.
The chrysanthemums await the Double Ninth,
As if saving their bloom for your cup of wine.

**Chant on Wind and Moon**

Cool winds are boundlessly pure,
Bright moons are boundlessly clear.
Purity and clarity never forsake me,
Ever fostering joy.
All day, threefold shame;
All day, threefold honor.
If honor and shame touch me not,
What cause have I for alarm?

**To Minister Fu**

The world strikes at joy and sorrow,
Who in this age can compare?
Three reigns as prime minister,
Four rivers as a man of leisure.
Illuminating all things through the ages,
He gathers back the one true essence.
I know not why,
Yet he treats me with such warmth.

**Chant on Wielding the Brush**

What man values is spirit,
Yet spirit, once possessed, is not pure.
Feigning truth from falsehood remains false,
Diligence to mask clumsiness still falls short.
Hunger sated brings sickness,
Seeking cure from sickness brings no true peace.
Many err in mistaking the sage,
But the sage never errs with the world.

**Inviting Sima Junshi to Stroll the Summer Garden**

The rain has cleared, the scene is fine,
Autumn deepens, the air not yet cold.
Might you join me in high spirits?
Let us linger awhile in the summer garden.

**Autumn Day After Rain, Gazing Idly**

Water gleams, clouds scatter, frost comes early,
Though late in the year, the yellow blooms are fair.
Though encircled by distant mountains on all sides,
A single slice of autumn light grows old.
Heaven creates all things without partiality,
Yet sages’ deeds baffle mortal understanding.
Common words need no boast—
Even mediocre talent suffices.

**Four Short Verses for Chen Jichang**

The eighth month is a small spring,
Small flowers bloom in profusion.
Evening brings a light rain,
Leaving the small carriage idle.

**Chant on Joy**

I ever delight in joy,
Joy that harms no righteousness.
Joy in heaven’s four seasons,
Joy in earth’s myriad things.
Joy in men’s fine conduct,
Joy in one’s own joyful deeds.
Beyond these joys,
I joy in the faintest intoxication.

**Chant Admonishing My Son**

Good and evil lie in where they dwell,
Dividing petty men from gentlemen.
To change course harms not one’s gentlemanly nature;
To persist in error is to become a petty man.
Good medicine cures when it benefits the ailment,
White jade is prized only when flawless.
To forge a fine vessel requires cutting and polishing—
How can faults not be made anew?

**On Hearing Shaohua Mountain’s Collapse**

Change leaves no trace in an instant,
Yet moving heaven and earth is no hard task.
If the giant spirit but stretched its hand,
Would Shaohua Mountain’s rise be all?
Six villages’ folk are swallowed,
Nine springs’ boulders overturned.
A woodcutter’s single word could be heeded—
Even in Yao and Shun’s time, it could be done.

**Chant on the Ancients**

Since ancient times, even great sages
Found matters difficult.
How much more for later men—
Could they so easily attain it?
Seeking it is endlessly hard,
Yet gaining it is effortless.
A thousand, ten thousand hearts,
But only one heart is right.

**Letter in Place of Writing to Old Friend Zu Longtu**

Thirty years of old friendship,
Meeting now with white-haired heads.
We once drank on the sea’s edge,
Roamed the Luo Society together.
Shedding the world’s storms,
We opened our hearts in pine and cassia autumn.
From now on, our brows
Should bear no idle sorrow.

**Chant on a Cold Night**

The sky adds a layer of cold,
I add a layer to my quilt.
I speak no words of the past,
Nor do what is excessive.
I blame myself strictly and thoroughly,
Demand little of others.
Only the great sage
Can stand in a place without fault.

**Chant on Knowing Fortune**

The cock’s duty is to herald dawn,
The dog’s duty is to guard.
Both serve their roles,
Yet all returns to serving their lord.

**On Hunger and Cold**

When I hunger, I too partake of food;
When I am cold, I too receive clothing.
Yet how is it I possess not a thread of merit
To repay the age?

**Trends**

Abandoning my divine tortoise,
I observe my own chewing jaws.
Turning from righteousness to profit,
Man lacks far-reaching thought.

**Gifts in Retirement**

Adorned in rustic gardens,
Silk bundles meager yet bound.
Having plotted the great,
The small lies within.

**Chant on the Unknowable**

The plow-ox sprouts crimson horns,
The aged oyster yields a luminous pearl.
Though men may wish not to use them,
Can mountains and rivers forsake them?

Affairs are fundamentally unknowable,
Things too are hard to constrain.
Once reduced to mere conjecture,
Righteousness loses its precision.

**Chant on Urgency**

At dawn’s extremity, one longs for rain;
In mortal illness, the heart seeks medicine.
In such moments for all,
No urging is needed to deepen resolve.

**Chant on Knowing Others**

Observe demeanor in times of urgency,
Reveal the liver and spleen in peril.
Deep hearts and composed faces may deceive in peace—
Beware of claiming easy knowledge.

**Chant on Speech**

A single word brings delight,
A thousand words stir greater wrath.
Though speech may unite,
It is speech that divides.

**Chant on Anticipating Misfortune**

Adornment nears empty vanity,
Yet empty vanity breeds deep misfortune.
To cure hunger, use food;
To relieve drought, require rain.

**Chant on a Human Lifetime**

A hundred million years lie ahead,
A hundred million years stretch behind.
Between them, a hundred years—
How much can one accomplish?

Even the lifespan of a tile,
Few reach a hundred years.
Why not rejoice,
Forcing oneself into sorrow?

**Thanks for the Gift of a Stone Zither**

Who took Heaven’s Pillar Peak,
And with a swift blade cleaved it in half?
Where springs once trickled, faint traces remain,
Where clouds embraced, their hue still lingers.

Neither the gates of power could move it,
Nor the halls of wealth turn it away.
What am I then,
To be offered as tribute to the Lord of the Underworld?

**Matching the Poem on First Snow, Tenth Month Twenty-Fourth Day, Presented to the Prime Minister and Elder**

On *renzi*, snow first arrives,
Sparse, then retreats to clear skies.
The world turns wholly white,
The forest beneath cannot bear its purity.

The cold scholar suffers dread,
The destitute tremble in fear.
With new laws restricting cups,
Why should they readily empty?

**Matching the Prime Minister and Elder**

Lofty towers have not yet celebrated,
Auspicious snow descends from cloud’s edge.
Though the earth is all white,
The heavens are not so cold.

A bountiful year may be awaited,
An inch of moisture hard to dry.
Let not the furrows be forgotten,
Trace the joy of *jirang* in the fields.

**At Tianjin Viewing Snow: A Letter in Place of Thanks to Scholar Jiang for Returning a Poetry Scroll**

The clear Luo flows to the heavens,
Cold clouds skim the earth in flight.
One stands upon the bridge,
Poetry returns through the snow.

**Viewing Snow in the Abode of Peace and Joy**

Layered clouds, drifting snow—
Within the Abode of Peace and Joy, gazing outward.
First marveling at the jade trees of the rear garden,
Then astonished by the shimmering Jasper Pool on level ground.

Before the Cold Food Festival, pear blossoms fade,
Before spring winds, willow fluff takes flight.
Wine leaves me half-drunk, the curtain half-raised—
Let not this feeling be known to outsiders.

**A World of Jade**

All before my eyes is jade,
The poor household thus grows rich.
Permitted to admire, not to sell,
Fitting for sorrow, not for ease.

After fine brew induces warmth,
Layered robes sustain the heat.
Would I dare, in this mortal realm,
To weigh gain and loss by the slightest measure?

**Responding to Minister Fu Han’s New Year’s Four Quatrains, Xining Sixth Year**

Four poems for the New Year,
Celebrating seventy years.
Consider the precedents of Tang—
Even the Duke of Jin was not permitted to retire.

**Matching Junshi and Duangming**

Cultivating the Dao in tranquil ease,
Frosted hair grows as it will.
Free from official blame,
Fortunate to escape worldly suspicion.

A thatched door suffices for contentment,
A broth of greens is never sated.
One peculiar joy—
Basking in the sun before the eaves.

**Four Joys of the Abode of Peace and Joy**

In the Abode of Peace and Joy, a joyful man,
At leisure, four treasures gladly keep him company.
One volume of poetry, carefree, gathers moon and flowers,
One tome of scripture, stern, astonishes ghosts and spirits.

One stick of incense, pure, uplifts the cosmos,
One cup of wine, fine, immerses in heaven’s truth.
Rejoicing in this great peace—how much more?
Only wishing the lord’s life span ten thousand springs.

**A Volume of Poetry in the Abode of Peace and Joy**

A volume of poetry in the Abode of Peace and Joy,
Singing to myself, chanting to myself, I find contentment.
Refining water and stone in idle endeavor,
Discerning wind and blossoms in quiet authority.

Thoughts take flight, suddenly mounting a thousand-mile steed,
Inspiration arises, first ascending the nine-tiered heavens.
When the mood strikes, altering a word or two,
Drunk, I chant five or seven verses.

Now fearing my heart communes with the moon beyond snow,
Now suspecting my body is an immortal in a cave.
The Silver River surges, churning waves in clear skies,
Jade trees gnarled, birthing purple mist.

All things with feeling may be depicted,
All bones free of illness cannot be purged.
Entrusted with themes, I am aided by spirits,
My lines, mistakenly, are spread by others.

Would I yield to noble houses’ constant music,
Or feel shame before wealthy chambers’ excess wealth?
If tallying such faults, how boundless they would be—
Why then do censors alone remain silent?

**A Tome in the Abode of Peace and Joy**

A tome in the Abode of Peace and Joy,
Titled *The August Ultimate*—what does it intend?
*Spring and Autumn*, rites and music, can they be abandoned?
Father and son, lord and minister—can they be abolished?

Vast, the era after Fuxi and Xuanyuan’s creation,
Majestic, the harmony of Yao and Shun’s beginning.
Fiery, Tang and Wu beyond war,
Turbulent, Huan and Wen beyond swords and bows.

Sun, moon, and stars shine brightly,
Kings, emperors, and lords’ voices resound grandly.
Thousands of rulers emerge with regulations,
Hundreds of millions of years form models.

Long governance breeds fear of overbearing power,
Deep troubles still call for the expulsion of evil.
Talents fit to command an age arise in their time,
Wisdom to aid the age is never absent.

The past is all subject to idle commentary,
The future must await another’s support.
Who is the master of creation,
To birth so many extraordinary men?

**A Stick of Incense in the Abode of Peace and Joy**

A stick of incense in the Abode of Peace and Joy,
Burned at dawn with no ordinary intent.
Disasters like these spare men from flattery,
Fortunes sought would outmeasure heaven.

Unlike the black and yellow robes beseeching temple statues,
Nor like children and girls perfuming their garments.
*Sincerity* arises—why trouble with prayer?
*Unwarranted* calamity—hard to dispel.

The empty chamber, cool and white,
The numinous terrace, bright and still, glows anew.

**Gazing at the Wind, Warding Off Bandits**

Gazing at the wind, warding off bandits—heart still drunk,
Facing the scene, like Yan Yuan, he sits in perfect forgetfulness.
In the Red Waters lies a pearl, cradling creation’s essence,
Within the Muddy Pellet, no thing bars the azure vault.

Born a man, still strong in body,
Meeting a flourishing age, the year abundant.
Sun and moon shine down—achievements vast,
Sovereign and minister shelter—how enduring their merit?

Not merely hearing the Dao has brought one to this,
Gold and jade—whose halls are not filled to overflowing?

**A Cup of Wine in the Abode of Peace and Joy**

A cup of wine in the Abode of Peace and Joy,
Not only to nurture qi, but to follow the true.
Sipped again and again, lightly drunk,
Patting one’s breast—all within is spring.

No different from sovereign and minister at first meeting,
Nor unlike heaven and earth at the dawn of boundless expanse.
The intoxicated savor—hard to name,
The brewing craft—impossible to describe.

Pouring holds depths, governed by harmonious principle,
Drinking knows no measure, entrusted with great schemes.
Beneath the Phoenix Tower, a carefree wanderer,
Within the walls of Jiaoru, a man at ease.

From the high pavilion, the view—flowers like brocade,
Where the small carriage rolls—grass like a carpet.
Unfurling and rolling up, the hand of rise and fall through ages,
Emerging and entering, a body of a thousand layers of clouds and waters.

After rain, quietly observing the mountain’s intent,
Before the wind, idly watching the moon’s spirit.
Such endeavors—weighed and distinguished,
Even ancient heroes, I fear, have not heard of them.

**On Chancellor Xie Fu’s Presentation of a New Scroll of Poetry**

A thoroughfare chosen, half planted with pines and bamboos,
An elder statesman resigns honor in a flourishing age.
Planting fine flowers to contemplate the nature of things,
Each draft of pure wine stirs the celestial truth.

The clear court will match the deeds of former years,
The jade grotto immortal—today’s body.
More still—twenty new poems,
Each word a rival to the radiance of spring.

Literature is the realm’s shared vessel,
Poetry, within literature, is no less refined.
Only by entering its nature does one know its true savor,
Only by attaining the divine does one see its wondrous craft.

Leisurely observing the wax and wane of years,
Silently reflecting the presence and absence of heaven and earth.
Its diction surpasses *Li Sao* in warmth and grace,
Though *Li Sao* lacks such ease and breadth.

**Delighting in Playful Verses in the Abode of Peace and Joy**

In the Abode of Peace and Joy, how fine to play the rogue,
To play the rogue—age must take its turn.
In bitter cold and scorching heat, doors stay shut,
When mild warmth and early cool arrive, one ventures out.

Wind and moon urge brush and ink,
Orioles and flowers draw one near wine jars.
Ask why one can live thus—
Only because talent nurtures the untalented.

**Matching Vice-Director Junshi’s Ascent of the Stone Pavilion**

Though the plain stretches far,
Who knows each thing renewed?
A perilous tower, a hundred feet high,
Holds ten thousand springs apart.

**Matching Vice-Director Junshi’s Wine-Ode**

Luoyang’s flowers and trees bloom across the city,
Further gifting the eastern capital’s paired flasks.
Thus do idle men turn wild,
Yet how can the red sun not sink in the west?

**Chanting Before Flowers**

Spring abides in flowers’ rivalry for beauty,
Spring departs—flowers wither in its wake.
Fine flowers cannot be detained,
Nor can fine guests easily meet.

Wine is drunk before flowers,
Flowers are best viewed with wine in hand.
Why pour another full cup?
To exhaust this moment’s joy.

**To Li Xichun, Agricultural Commissioner in Chengdu, in Rhyme**

I think of you, yet you do not return,
You linger in your Sichuan post.
Though white-haired and weary,
A pure heart should find its own ease.

Flower season—hard to meet,
Silkworm market—easy to rejoice.
Do not sigh at retirement’s delay,
Life’s toil is not yet done.

**Letter in Place of Li Zundu, Imperial Commissioner in Guangxin**

A thousand *li* beyond Jibei,
Han and Tang marked the frontier’s edge.
Yet how is it today’s land
No longer bears its old mountains and rivers?

The tiger’s tent—warriors revere it,
The carved bow—passed to heirs.
When the day comes to inscribe merit,
Let none fall short of later Yanran.

**Self-Matching "Playful Verses"**

In the Abode of Peace and Joy, how fine to play the rogue,
Knowing full well I lack surpassing talent.
Old age brings many ills, yet I take no medicine,
Youth’s bold heart has long turned to ash.

Courtyard grass, though cut, never fully vanishes,
Railing flowers, though tended, struggle to bloom.
A light breeze stirs half-drunken wine—
This joy comes straight from beyond the heavens.

*Yichuan’s "Striking the Earth" Collection, Volume Ten*

**Thirteen Poems on Encountering Spring in Old Age**

**I**
Old age meets spring—do not suspect its guile,
For in these years, youth’s return I revere.
Men’s hearts grow cold, wine fails to cheer,
The sky stays chill, the flowers refuse to appear.
Beyond the dyke, wind bends the willows aslant,
Beneath the wall, rain nurtures moss half-grown.
Last year’s waves flowed eastward, gone for good—
Why then does fresh green rise anew?

**II**
Old age meets spring—spring now in full array,
Its splendor bright before the Smoke-Prohibition Day.
Just chilled, then warmed, the season tends the flowers,
Rain’s voice departs, the sky clears for wine’s hours.
To pour or pause, the cups must know their lord,
To plant the peach and plum—who holds the sway?
Pure talk already stirs the heart to joy,
Yet wild verse I take for strings to play.

**III**
Old age meets spring—rain just now cleared,
And clearer still, the approach of Pure Bright near.
The sky hangs low o’er palace halls, the days grow long,
The garden warm, but orioles still hold their song.
From lofty towers, the flowers seem brocade,
Where grass is thick as matting, carriages glide.
How generous the Lord of Spring’s decree—
Once more the world enjoys long peace.

**IV**
Old age meets spring—do not weary of its stay,
Living now by Heaven’s Ford, how fine the day.
With water and bamboo as life’s design,
I must become the master of wind and bloom.
The old estate’s debris I clear away,
New beds I tend with care, planting orchid’s perfume.
I know not if beyond this quiet land
Another place could hold this frame of mine.

**V**
Old age meets spring—now first I know its grace,
Yet fear its beauty belongs to idle hands alone.
Who grasps the Lord of Blue’s great artistry?
How dare I vie with youth’s unruly throng?
Wine from young brew I taste for its pure tone,
Flowers in dawn’s dew I watch for their bright spirit’s song.
All rare things are hard to entrust—
Yet Nature never fails the one who belongs.

**VI**
Old age meets spring—spring’s moods abound,
Who dyes the waves? Who twists the willow’s crown?
By pond and pavilion, love knows no end,
Yet how to match the thriving grass and tree?
Raise the cups to share the heart’s intent,
But guard against wind and rain that mar serenity.
Amid a thousand reds and myriad greens,
Is there another idle soul like me?

**VII**
Old age meets spring—do not disdain its stay,
Lest spring, in stinginess, bring worldly strife.
Of four seasons, only spring is fair,
In all the year, scarce ten days free from care.
No need to beg the moon for wine’s delight,
But spare the flowers from rain’s cruel blight.
Yet when a thousand petals drift away,
How much gold could buy such joy as this?

**VIII**
Old age meets spring—do not tire of its return,
For how many springs remain to see?
Press the winecup, urge the guest to stay,
Lest laughing branches mock my folly.
The world’s ways cannot bear the new or old,
Things’ truths are hard to tell from falsehood’s guise.
Who says the phoenix and simurgh speak too much?
This grievance runs too deep for words to rise.

**IX**
Old age meets spring—my zest is not yet spent,
I beg kind Spring to linger, to relent.
If good deeds fear the flowers’ fading hue,
Then with deep feeling, hold the candle high and roam.
In wine, the merit of a warhorse’s idle sweat,
In verse, the crime of quiet elegance.
The Lord of Spring cannot endure our jest—
He scolds the branches, never ceasing spite.

**X**
Old age meets spring—do not regret the wild,
For wildness checked, the spirit’s fire grows mild.
The garden, just when beauty turns too bright,
Is struck by wind and rain, by idle spite.
Flowers half-open—hasten to admire,
Wine just ripe—taste it first, take no delay.
Most fine things Heaven guards with jealous care,
Not by our whim are they bestowed this way.

**XI**
Old age meets spring—spring cannot bear my weight,
This burden comes from age’s slow advance.
One body’s decline—what is there to regret?
But spring’s departure fills the eyes with want.
When the red sun sinks, the wind grows fierce,
Where fallen blooms drift, the waters run deep.
The wandering oriole does not grasp spring’s end,
Still from the branches it sings its sweet refrain.

**XII**
Old age meets spring—I see through spring at last,
No need to grieve, no need to mourn its past.
Body and heart have their own place of rest,
How can mere grass and trees beguile the wise?
Today’s glory is tomorrow’s withered state,
This year’s freshness was last year’s new.
In this world, joy and sorrow ever chase—
How much wine could ever calm your mind?

**XIII**
To Minister Sima Junshi of Chongde, Long Awaited but Not Arrived

Your household swallows from the rafters last year,
This year past the festival, they’ve not returned.
I beg forgiveness for delaying you so long—
Your carriage comes at last through flowers deep.

Heaven bestowed on you eight measures of talent,
A rustic must turn back midway to meet.
One word from the immortal I cannot forget—
Beyond the flowers, your carriage still unseen.

**Two Parting Quatrains**

Beyond the tower, flowers block the narrow way,
Hard to forget your virtue, my longing stays.
I’d ask the peach and plum to offer thanks,
But peach and plum are mute—what can they say?

On the high pavilion, admiring flowers,
I bear the guilt of breaking my word.
If verse could ransom fault,
What time could I not keep you company?

**Ascending the Stone Pavilion on a Spring Day**

Throughout Luoyang, the homes of ministers and lords,
They plant peach and plum as livelihood.
Each year in the second month, from on high,
No homes are seen—only the flowers abound.

**At Sixty-Three**

Now sixty-three years old,
Teeth and hair may fade, but not my will.
Ashamed to waste my spirit in vain play,
How could I squander talent on reckless display?
Dread the sound of scraping bone,
Weary of schemes that test the blade’s keen edge.
The sage’s words I hold in reverence:
“To fall is simply to gain advantage.”
*(Master Chen Xiyi once spoke these words.)*

**On Reflecting on Affairs**

The ancients we do not see,
Yet we may observe their hearts.
Their hearts held nothing else,
But deep regard for righteousness.
The people of today we do not see in heart,
Only in face may we perceive.
Their faces hold nothing else,
But shallow regard for gain.
To regard righteousness is to benefit others,
To regard gain is to harm the people.
Benefiting others or harming the people,
In the end, it turns back on oneself.
If by luck one escapes,
The calamity still falls upon descendants.

**Occasional Writing**

Heaven births the myriad things,
Each fulfilling its own way.
Only humans are most wise,
Able to encompass all.

**On Noble and Base Natures**

Orchids and irises, fragrant and pure;
Unicorns and phoenixes, rare and divine.
Such are the people—
Few who are not virtuous.
Wolfsbane and wild aconite, venomous and foul;
Owls, turtledoves, and vipers, cruel and dire.
Such are the people—
Few who are not corrupt.
Virtue seeks only peace,
Corruption seeks only ruin.
Day and night without cease,
They take their turns before us.
Heaven covers all without partiality,
Earth bears all without favor.
Only when both can nurture,
Do we know their boundless grace.

**Occasional Verse**

Frogs and crickets scurry through mud,
Phoenixes soar beyond the clouds.
Though the distance between mud and sky is vast,
How can they ever know one another?

**Ode to the Harmonizing Decoction**

Two flavors blend within the jar,
A single sip brings wondrous effect.
Shared in leisure, no cause for care,
Drunk alone—yet who does so for sorrow?
A mere touch awakens the true master’s call,
Half-tipsy, one roams with Fuxi’s spirit.
All praise the joy of drunkenness,
But who would cease before the cup runs dry?

**Washing the Bamboo**

Through frost and autumn, pine and cypress stand,
Yet thickets grow unchecked, their shadows dense.
All useless branches I strip away,
Leaving only those that reach the sky.
Like the echo of a dragon’s song,
Or the phoenix’s return—work complete.
Not for their use alone,
But for their noble bearing, unmatched in the world.

**Ode to Heaven’s Will**

Heaven’s will is nothing but nature,
Beyond nature, no heaven remains.
Who fears the dark when no deceit is sown?
Seek the source to sever all greed.
Before the labor, words may still be spoken,
But at the harvest—what more is there to say?
The sage’s work is hard to follow,
For the priceless pearl lies deep in the abyss.

**A Playful Letter to Brother Longtu**

Brother, born in the same year,
Twenty-seven days my elder.
No grudge bends my brow,
Yet joy makes us clap our hands.
Our bond deepens day by day,
Our shared Dao and righteousness endure.
Only one thing is lacking—
A scribe to inscribe in cinnabar:
Eight hundred taels of gold.
*(You chose me to write the epitaph for your parent’s burial.)*

**Raising the Cup**

I raise my cup to my sons,
Now sixty-three years old.
Though my station is not lofty,
My discourse on the Dao leaves no shame.
Worldly glory fades,
Yet the joy of the grove still tempts me.
If you ask what tempts me—
It is this: to escape the world’s suspicion.

**Facing the Flowers, Seventh Year of Xining**

Flower branches gleam in the winecup,
I raise the cup to toast the blooms.
Wine runs out, but money buys more,
Withered flowers—no medicine revives.
Let no man drink to excess too soon,
Nor let the flowers scatter too fast.
Drink slowly before the blossoms,
For how long can spring endure?

**Four Ways**

The Way of Heaven waxes and wanes,
The Way of Earth rises and falls.
The Way of Man knows rise and decline,
The Way of Things flourishes and fades.
Rise and decline do not share the same age,
Flourishing and fading do not share the same time.
Yet why, when men face these,
Do they know such joy and sorrow?

**Forest Retreat**

A marvel hidden in the woods,
Unknown to the vulgar crowd.
Now a full moon’s radiant night,
Now a branch of blossoms unfurled.
The wine is not yet poured,
The guests must not depart.
Fortunate are we few in the world,
To have even this much.

**Spring Overcast**

Day after day, spring is overcast,
The gloom of spring ever deepens.
Though I have the strength to tend the flowers,
How could I lack the heart to love the moon?
Only when the moon is full can it be seen,
Only when the flowers bloom can they be praised.
Yet why do flowers and moon
Show so little mercy to man’s longing?
Fair flowers are hard to gaze upon for long,
Bright moons are hard to watch for long.
Flowers last but five or seven days,
The moon is full but twelve times a year.
Even at its fullest, it wanes,
Even in bloom, it withers.
Wind and rain are common things,
Why then does the human heart not rest?

**Toasting the Flowers**

I raise my cup to the flower branches,
Let the flowers understand this too:
Flowers do not bloom for ten days,
Man has but a hundred years.
In this fleeting, soul-stirring moment,
Who would think of the haze of wine?
Without poetry to sever the bond,
How could one unravel a lifetime’s confusion?

**Rising Late**

Half-remembered, half-forgotten dreams upon waking,
Seeming sorrow, yet no sorrow—only weariness.
Wrapped in robes, lying sideways, unwilling to rise,
Beyond the curtain, fallen petals swirl in chaos.

**Reflections on Affairs**

The noble and the petty stand opposed,
Wisdom above, folly below—unshaken truth.
Wolfsbane’s roots do not entwine with orchids,
Yet why do they share this heaven and earth?

**Three Delusions**

To age without rest is the first delusion,
To be at ease yet joyless is the second,
To be idle yet impure is the third.
These three delusions destroy the self.

**Four Joys**

First joy: long life as one’s domain,
Second joy: a bountiful year as one’s kingdom,
Third joy: leisure as one’s virtue,
Fourth joy: peace and health as one’s power.

**What Is It Like?**

Stand as a true man,
Act not as a petty one.
All in life is fated from the start—
Why waste effort in vain calculations?

**Questioning Spring**

Since ancient times, flowers must be paired with orioles,
Orioles and flowers were meant to appear together.
Why then do the flowers fade before the orioles arrive,
Yet still bear the name of "oriole and flower"?
I would ask spring, but spring does not answer,
What secret love does it hold for bees and butterflies?
The wandering oriole refuses to bear spring’s betrayal,
Singing a thousand cries, then ten thousand more.

**From the Tower to a Friend**

A guest often scorns the spring on level ground,
Yet spring cannot but be as it is.
None are as content in a humble lane as I,
Yet once I ascend this tower, I think of you.
All I see are verdant groves and clouds,
Half the tiled roofs veiled in blossoms, fresh and new.
To lean on the railing, the heart must be free—
Who in this world is truly free to lean?

**On Loss**

The more one loses, the less one gains,
Leaving only sighs in between.
A man’s glory or decline is but the way of things,
Flowers bloom and fade—why chase them?
We meet by chance, then part again,
Now sharing joy, now sharing sorrow.
If one sees through it all, nothing remains—
Why trouble oneself with distinctions?

**Placing Flowers**

Flower branches reflect in the winecup,
Within the winecup, fine flower branches.
My body has known two eras of peace,
My eyes have seen four dynasties at their height.
Moreover, my limbs remain strong,
And the season is at its most fragrant.
Wine holds the flowers’ crimson glow,
How can I bear not to drink to intoxication before them?

**Ode to Leisure**

To dwell in leisure, one must dwell in Luoyang,
For nowhere else in the world compares.
A land of culture, gathering the wise,
A city of mountains and rivers, ancient imperial seat.

**By Rare Blooms, Holding Fragrant Wine**

By rare blooms, I hold fragrant wine,
On softest grass, I move my little cart.
Only Yaofu fails his old friends—
Yet none of his friends fail Yaofu.

**Matching Rhymes with Academician Zhang Zijian**

Eight years of reunion, yet grievance remains,
How can parting wine be poured again?
Though my plain speech may seem like scattered pearls,
I know the pure and harmonious sound of jade.
To live in this world, one should be a man of worth,
To admire flowers, one must be in Luoyang.
I know the true men of past and present—
The craft of creation is no easy thing.

**Responding to the Twelve Poems Presented by Editor Huan of Gongcheng**

To capture likeness in painting is no easy match,
Though painting may depict form, it cannot grasp the heart.
Reading your ten poems three times over,
I find it surpasses revisiting my hometown once more.
The old capital stirs new longing,
The homeland appears as of old, towering and green.
Of fame and worldly affairs, ask not—
Only two streams of clear tears to wipe away.

---

**Ode to the Joy of Things**

Sun, moon, and stars—heaven’s light,
Ears, eyes, mouth, nose—man’s spirit.
Kings, emperors, lords, and hegemons arise from sound,
Heaven’s intent is not far from human feeling.
Birds, beasts, grasses, trees—each kind differs,
Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—each rank forms.
How to ensure years of plenty and lasting peace,
That joy may be shared with all things in their glory?

**Ode to Welcoming Spring**

Spring arrives, and I seek it through poetry,
Spring departs, and I pursue it with wine.
Wine is drunk for spring’s coming and going,
Poems are written for flowers’ blooming and fading.
Flowers bloom and fade, poems are written again and again,
Spring comes and goes, wine is poured repeatedly.
My feelings run deep, not for the young in years—
How can one bear the surging harmony within?

---

**Ode to Late Spring**

Sentimental Pan Yu envies the willow catkins,
Drifting in and out of a thousand, ten thousand homes.
Youthful vigor and ambition are all lost,
Old age knows nothing of new affairs.
My poems may have faults, but others forgive,
While my wine’s merits I alone proclaim.
Yet one lingering sorrow remains—
Most of my old friends are now beyond the horizon.

**Two Poems Matching Rhymes with Minister Wang Zhongmei on His Retirement**

**I**
Seventy years in this world awaited,
Like Master Zhang, I compose my return to the fields.
To know the times and act accordingly is wisdom indeed,
Who would say nurturing one’s will is not right?
Moreover, there is joy in forests and streams,
No longer bound by official duties.
Recently, I drove my little cart to call,
Only to find you napping on a spring afternoon.

**II**
Since ancient times, talent soars when inspired,
Why does my lord alone know the times?
A lifetime of aspirations never bent,
In this flourishing age, hanging up your cap is fitting.
Willows sway gently in the breeze,
Flowers, pressed by spring, smile as the sun lingers.
The clamor of attendants shakes the earth as they pass,
Yet no one asks who it is.

---

**Matching Rhymes with Attendant Wang of Beijing on His Visit and Gift of Poems**

Your carriage came from Beijing to admire spring,
Geng Jun’s heart had already raced ahead.
Now frost falls heavily—what can be done?
This year’s flowers bloom in vain, all sound.
You honor me with fine verses and a visiting card,
Surely there are no clumsy lines to convey my name.
Heaven’s talent and beauty should be cherished—
I know you were not born in vain for this age.

---

**Ode to Joy**

Five joys in this life,
Five delights in dwelling in Luoyang.
Most take them lightly as commonplace,
Yet I hold them as no small matter.
My talent is unremarkable,
My knowledge leaves no record.
But my heart is at peace—
How could I ever exhaust these?

**The Five Joys:**
First, to be born in the Central Kingdom,
Second, to be born a man,
Third, to be born a scholar,
Fourth, to witness an era of great peace,
Fifth, to hear of the Dao and righteousness.

**The Five Delights:**
First, many good people,
Second, many fine deeds,
Third, many beautiful things,
Fourth, many lovely scenes,
Fifth, many grand principles.

---

**Ode to Joyousness**

Joyous, ever joyous,
Joy and delight, ever more joy.
Noble men are my friends,
Fine scenes are mine to behold.
Fine wine is mine to drink,
Fine food is mine to savor.
This body, born and grown old,
Lives entirely in an age of peace.

---

**Ode to the Heavenly Dao**

The Heavenly Dao is not hard to know,
Human nature is not easy to fathom.
Though one hears words,
One must also observe deeds.
Leaning on the desk—great effort,
Wielding the halberd—base endeavor.
The *Spring and Autumn* relies on seizing the moment,
A little cart is all one needs.

---

**Ode to a Single Chamber**

A single chamber can hold a life,
All four seasons bring eternal spring.
Never lacking fine wine,
Never without worthy guests.
Within the grotto, the flower admirer is Junshi—
His dwelling has a grotto.
At the edge of the sky, the moon-floating man is Junzhi—
His dwelling has a tower.
When we meet, there should be words,
Laughing at my excessive caution.

---

**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of the Eastern Capital, on His Solitary Stroll by the Luo River**

Caps and carriages crowd the nine thoroughfares,
Voices clamor and jostle for precedence.
Only you take none of this as a matter,
At last, I believe there are true men in this world.
The wind turns, the river’s voice grows faint,
The setting sun, pale, is veiled by clouds.
A pair of white egrets appears beyond the mist,
About to land on the sand, they take flight again.

---

**A Solitary Stroll by Tianjin Bridge After Rain**

Luoyang’s palaces are veiled in clear mist,
Since Tang and Han, their histories are recorded.
How many rises and falls have vanished—
Only the old mountains and rivers remain on all sides.

---

**Spring’s Colors**

Last year, spring departed and would not stay,
This year, where has spring’s color come from?
Luoyang is everywhere a Peach Blossom Spring,
My little cart slowly turns toward East Street.

---

**Ode to Great Peace**

In days of great peace under heaven,
In times of ease for all people,
When flowers bloom in profusion,
How can one keep from smiling?

---

**Four Poems Left at the Foot of Jinping Mountain During the Cold Food Festival**

**I**
The riverbank teems with peach and plum blossoms,
I cannot bear to see them ravaged by the wind.
How can I let this spring slip away?
I linger on the heights, reluctant to leave.

**II**
Cold Food Festival’s wind and mist at Jinping’s foot,
From on high, I raise my cup—what joy!
The riverbank’s peach and plum blossoms are radiant,
I cannot bear to see them shattered by the wind.

**III**
Boundless peach and plum blossoms await Qingming,
Only after a year do they fully bloom.
Do they not recall the Creator’s labor?
Why does the wild wind cruelly torment them?

**IV**
Half of spring’s flowers bloom in a hundred thousand ways,
Lately, the east wind has cruelly ravaged them.
Pitiful are the peach and plum, so gentle in nature—
Blown away, they utter not a word.

---

**Two Years of Visits to Jinping Mountain, Unable to Meet Magistrate Zheng—Sent to Him in Verse**

**Year after year, the myriad blossoms bloom in splendor,**
Beneath Jinping Mountain, spring’s rewards arrive.
Two years now, I’ve failed to follow your immortal footsteps—
Has the cave’s transcendent one not yet returned?

---

**Before the Eastern Pavilion, a single peony blooms in unmatched glory,**
Twenty-four branches, each a beauty knitting her brows.
Of all the world’s spring, Luoyang claims ten parts—
Yet the Shao family alone holds seven or eight.

**A single peony blooms in wondrous rarity,**
Twenty-four branches encircled by graceful maidens.
None in Luoyang City know this marvel—
The Shao family alone claims the season’s finest hour.

---

**Flower Season Hindered by Rain, Unable to Go Out**

In Luoyang, spring reaches its midpoint in the third month,
Swing ropes still hang, catkins drift on the breeze.
My small carriage stays idle in the mud of spring,
Amid scattered petals, orioles sing in flight.

---

**Chanting in the Abode of Peace**

In the Abode of Peace, duties are fulfilled as they ought—
Beyond this, what more could one seek?
I welcome all scholars under heaven,
And wander every garden in Luoyang.

What I must do, I do with utmost sincerity;
In observing others, I never strain to see their efforts.
Yet recalling those carefree springtime words—
They lift me to a hundred-foot tower.

**Sima Junshi once wrote:**
*“Only now do I know—*
*On level ground,*
*One cannot exhaust the sight of youthful spring.”*

In the Abode of Peace, nothing stirs—
Save a single scroll of Fuxi’s writings.
When weary, I rest my head, no need for sleep;
After meals, I take my staff and wander where I will.

I prepare to steep tea with dew-gathered water,
And guard against mixing herbs to cultivate perch.
Were it not for the sages who dispelled my ignorance,
I might have become a shallow man of this world.

In the Abode of Peace, I pore over old texts,
Old texts that record and link anew.
Three thousand days beneath lamp and candlelight,
Twenty years among waters and flowers.

Mountains and rivers have their masters, hard to claim;
Yet the wind and moon, free for all, I seize at will.
Let none ask of my idle chanting—
This art is not passed down in the world.

In the Abode of Peace, I am a lord of ten thousand households,
How could I bear to waste these fine days and fair scenes?
I’ve already grasped spring in its fullness—
Now, in old age, I would let my heart roam free.

When morning dew is heavy, flowers fill the balustrade;
When warm wine floats, cups brim with drink.
The Sage’s affairs are but trifles—
They spare both effort and worry.

In the Abode of Peace, spring dreams fade,
No worldly dust to clutter the heart.
A light breeze brushes past my seat;
Faint music drifts from beyond the heavens.

As the sun shifts, I lean on my staff and sandals;
Where flower shadows mingle, I linger by the wine jar.
Nowhere in the world compares to my homeland—
And how much finer, for my homeland teems with talent.

In the Abode of Peace, spring does not wane,
The mountain elder comes and goes in his small carriage.
By the water’s edge, green willows line the shore;
Beyond the flowers, fragrant grass carpets the dyke.

Bright-eyed, I watch the scenes of the third month;
Vigorous, I’ve lived through four reigns.
By the Phoenix Tower, near the Heavenly Ford,
I face the wind, tipsy, and return home.

In the Abode of Peace, the third month draws near,
Only in old age do I learn to cherish fragrant blossoms.
I know this one delight is mine to claim—
Who would leave even a single gold coin unspent?

Fine wine I drink until slightly drunk;
Fair flowers I admire at half their bloom.
Such feelings defy description—
I fear no one in the world understands.

In the Abode of Peace, as spring wanes,
I shut my door, too indolent to sit, few guests come.
A gentle rain clears between the bamboo;
Emerald birds flit above the flowers.

I record the finest scenes in verse,
And sustain joy with wine.
Beyond this, all else in life—
I turn my head and feign ignorance.

In the Abode of Peace, I am far from poor,
For within, there is a couch to hold me.
Confucian winds transformed, reaching the Dao,
Harmony fills the four seasons, ever like spring.

Sun and moon shine bright, the sovereign’s light;
Words become trust, trust arises from men.
Only man and the sun stand close—
Beyond this, what truth remains?

In the Abode of Peace, though unsettled,
A brief course of medicine restores me.
In ordinary times, free of illness, I take no herbs—
Even in misfortune, I await heaven’s will.

When reason dims, I must seek discourse;
When emotions reach their end, what more is there to say?
All other vain and idle thoughts—
I may as well exchange them for a day’s sleep.

In the Abode of Peace, spring is about to depart,
Though loath to compose a poem to send it off.
Though spring ages and is hard to reclaim,
Early summer soon arrives to take its place.

Drink wine, but do not let it lead to drunkenness;
Admire flowers, but take care not to let them scatter.
If one understands such things,
How could idle sorrows ever furrow the brow?

**He also wrote:**
In the Abode of Peace, the third month draws near,
Only in old age do I learn to cherish fragrant blossoms.
Beware drunkenness, lest it breed illness;
Fear the scattering of flowers, for they will soon take flight.

Drink wine, but do not let it lead to drunkenness;
Admire flowers, but take care not to let them scatter.
Scattered flowers and drunkenness—bitter tastes,
Bringing not joy, but sorrow.

Born a man in an auspicious time,
In the Abode of Peace, a life of ease and wealth.
With grand strokes, I write poems boasting of vigor;
With a small cup, I savor light, pure wine.

Mountains and rivers, clear after rain;
Grasses and trees, radiant in spring’s embrace.
The Creator’s craftsmanship, so exquisite—
All should be entrusted to the carefree.

In the Abode of Peace, though unbound,
Unbound, I never stray from the Confucian path.
Light wine I sip from a small cup;
Bold poems I write in large characters.

Flowers and trees, radiant after spring rain;
Mountains and rivers, clear in late autumn’s wake.
How vast the meaning in idleness—
Unashamed to be a true man in this world.

---

**On Eating Pears**

I urge you, do not favor the golden-flowered pear,
But rather, love the red-fading pear.
Though both share a hue like rouge,
Their tastes differ greatly.

The red-fading pear is sweet as maltose;
The golden-flowered pear makes you frown.
Such deceptions abound—
Before eating, you must discern them well.

---

**Matching Rhymes in Reply to Vice Director Wang Anzhi**

Peaks rise like screens on all sides,
How can I bear to see them piled with drifting clouds?
We’ve already shared countless flower-viewings—
Let us now arrange a few mountain excursions.

Though not yet old, autumn’s light inspires my brush;
At the first chill, wine fills my cup.
A light breeze is already delightful—
How much finer, if it comes from the depths of water lilies and lotuses.

**Viewing Flowers on the Third Day of the Third Month, Thinking of Friends**

On the third day, viewing flowers—how lush their intent!
This year, just as it was in years past.
Where now are those who once shared the sight?
Raising my cup, I still face the distant wind.

---

**Teasing Prefect Wu**

In recent years, men slight fine flowers,
Unknowing how the Lord of Spring resents their scorn.
He bids their price rise a hundredfold—
And buys back all the spring of Luoyang.

One plant bears twenty-four branches,
Each branch a beauty to overthrow a city.
Yet fearing the wild wind’s chill bite,
He has them all inscribed in verse at their prime.

At my home grows one peony, named "Hue-Enhancing Red,"
Which blooms in twenty-four branches.

---

**Oriole’s Song**

To rise to the high bough was ever its fate,
Though it left the valley not long ago.
Its tongue is but tender bamboo,
Its robe newly woven of gold.

For the flowers, it speaks of their brilliance;
For the willows, it tells of their grace.
At dusk beyond the willows, it still trills;
At dawn before the flowers, it sings again.

Its song swells when rain has passed;
Its trills fade as spring departs.
Let no traveler hear it—
The traveler’s path is already lost.

---

**On Appreciating Flowers**

Those who do not truly appreciate flowers
Love only their outward form.
Those who do appreciate them
Love only their inner wonder.

The form lies in their hues,
Hues men may imitate.
The wonder lies in their spirit,
A spirit no man can create.

---

**On Drinking Wine**

Those who do not drink well
Delight only in drinking much.
Those who do drink well
Delight only in drinking harmoniously.

To drink much is to grow sodden;
Sodden, the body falls ill.
To drink harmoniously is to grow mellow;
Mellow, the face glows bright.

---

**On Fewer Concerns**

Fewer cares, fewer dreams;
Fewer words, fewer faults.
The curtain hangs—one knows the day is long;
The willows stand still—one feels the breeze is light.

One sees only flowers bloom and fade,
Hears no gossip of right or wrong.
Why seek a grotto abode?
The years will pass slowly enough.

---

**A Spring’s Span**

A spring holds ninety days—
Half are lost to wind and rain.
The flowers are fair, yet no one sees;
The heart runs wild, yet cannot be restrained.

---

**The World’s Song**

The world is ever in tumult—
Who in it is free of cares?
How fortunate am I alone,
Reclining to watch Luoyang’s spring!

---

**Spring Waters**

Spring waters run clear into waves,
Yet waves can do nothing.
They cannot dye other things,
Only the lightest silks.

---

**Spring Rain**

Spring rain, fine as silk threads,
Drizzling down in gentle drops.
How can one downpour
Make all things flourish so?

---

**What a Pity**

What a pity—this flourishing spring,
Gone in a moment, never to be found again.
Before my eyes, gardens stretch without end,
Yet all I see are orioles singing, no men in sight.

---

**Pinning Flowers**

Pinning flowers, I feign youth;
Pouring wine, I pretend carelessness.
The flowers are fair, the wine is fine, the mood finer still—
Yet tomorrow, my illness will only deepen.

---

**Spring Departs**

As spring departs, do not lament its lateness;
Summer arrives—rejoice in its newness.
Though lingering fragrance remains,
It cannot compare to the shade of green.

---

**Matching Rhymes in Farewell to Prefect Li Junxi, Drafter of the Dragon Diagram**

The affectionate Prefect bids spring farewell,
Just as the flowers burst into fullest bloom.
Since ancient times, heroes have prized gratitude—
Fair blossoms, do not scatter too soon.

---

**Three Poems in Reply to Li Xi Chun, Agricultural Commissioner**

Last year, you sent me poems from afar—
Even then, I sighed at how few friends remained.
Now, barely half of those survive—
How long can we delay our joyful gatherings?

By bamboo groves and water’s edge, the heart feels light;
Beneath the moon, before the wind, the mood is rich.
In Luoyang’s gatherings, days without cares—
If not for our few, who else remains?

The sun and moon in my breast now brighten, now darken;
Wind and clouds beneath my brush now gather, now part.
Though old and without achievement, I am thus—
What would I do if I ever succeeded?

---

**On Encountering Spring in Old Age**

In old age, meeting spring—do not doubt it:
*Commentary: When the patterns of things unfold, when human feelings are laid bare.*
Though no form is visible,
Only the heart can know.

In old age, one learns to cherish the fragrant and fair.
*Commentary: The prime of the year, the height of the three spring months.*
The flowers are worthy of love—
How much more so the finest blooms?

I know this one moment of delight is fated.
*Commentary: When all plants vie in beauty, when rare flowers stand apart.*
The Lord of Spring’s deep intent
Is also to be known by men.

Who would let a thousand gold pieces go to waste?
*Commentary: When the sun hastens, when gold nears its end.*
Extravagant hearts spend all,
Only then do brows unfurrow.

Let fine wine be drunk to mild intoxication,
*Commentary: When the jar’s head foams, when the cup’s surface blooms.*
When guests come to call—
Even in winter, it is called "the time of Fuxi."

Let the fair flowers open halfway,
*Commentary: When the wind is light, as if smiling; when the dew is heavy, as if weeping.*
Only at the point of smile and tear
Does their rich fragrance cling to one’s robes.

Such meaning is hard to name—
*Commentary: When yin and yang first stir, when heaven and earth are not yet divided.*
Words cannot reach it,
Nor brush and ink depict it.

I fear no one in the world understands.
*Commentary: When wine reaches mellow drunkenness, when flowers are in fullest bloom.*
Mellow drunkenness leads to sodden stupor;
Fullest bloom leads to scattering petals.

**Matching Rhymes to Minister Xie Yanguo’s "Returning Drunk in Wind and Rain at Night’s Depth"**

In the Hall of the Dao, idle talk fills the hours,
Yet beyond the dust, cups and goblets do not fly in vain.
As I mount the small carriage, the streets are already still—
Drunk, I return with the wind and rain in the night’s depth.

---

**Matching Rhymes to Minister Xie Junshi’s "Only Flowers and Plants Mark Winter and Spring"**

At times, I ask myself—
Am I not a man from before Fuxi’s time?
The days pass, the months come, yet I do not record them—
Only flowers and plants mark winter and spring.

---

**Matching Rhymes to Minister Xie Kuang’s "Lesser Light Now Aligns with the Stars"**

A single word in poetry, its meaning still unclear—
The Lesser Light now aligns with the stars.
I, a man of leisure, have long been without proof—
Why open the back gate for more men of leisure?

---

**Matching Rhymes to Vice Director An Zhi’s "Only Now Knowing Peace Is the Ladder to the Dao"**

My dwelling’s name is "Peace and Joy"—how fitting the laughter!
Yet arm pain and head-wind follow one after another.
Just when I see peace, I find peace and joy—
Only now knowing peace is the ladder to the Dao.

**Matching Rhymes to Minister Kai Shu’s "To Gain the Most, Seek Nothing"**

A guest asks of worldly affairs—what are they like?
Yaofu replies: "I know nothing of others.
Dwelling beneath the forest, walking beneath the forest—
To gain the most, seek nothing."

---

**Matching Rhymes to Censor Bo Chun’s "The Master Was No Trickster"**

Great undertakings demand men of talent,
While the work of governance requires great ministers.
At ease in the "Nest of Peace and Joy," carefree in repose—
How could one know the master was no trickster?

---

**Self-Response: "This Joy Comes Straight from Beyond the Heavens"**

Gained from suffering, it ends in suffering;
Born of sorrow, it returns to sorrow.
Since it is found neither in sorrow nor joy,
This joy comes straight from beyond the heavens.

**Three Poems Parting from Chancellor Xie Yanguo**

**I**
You match rhymes with the Elder of Han,
Comparing me to Confucius.
You cite his return to Lu,
Pointing me toward the western frontier—
Another time, the move to Luo.
Sun and stars share in great deeds,
While deer and elk remain humble.
Honored by your praise and favor,
How can I repay what I know?

**II**
Confucius, heaven-endowed, truly enlightened,
His work in creation brought to fulfillment.
You compare me to his return to Lu—
How could Yaofu’s talents bear such a weight?
Once I dashed off wild verses before your seat,
Yet before your seat, you remained a sage of the grotto-heaven.

**Untitled Poems**

**Parting from Chancellor Xie Junshi, Grand Academician**

Boundless wind and moon inspire my thoughts,
Who dares compare to such limpid purity?

**Parting from Chancellor Xie Junshi**
Cao Zhi’s eight measures of talent now urge me on.
Silken verses enfold me, orchid lines unfold.
Ailing limbs, a body worn—
Sweltering heat shimmers the towers.
Better to chant your poems,
And the cool breeze will rise of itself.

**Chanting in Large Script**
Poems composed, half-drunk and mellow,
Transcribed with a brush broad as a rafter.
When the heart is full, let the hand roam free;
When the spirit congeals, dip the tip once more.
Lu Yang’s sun-reversing feat was but slight,
Zong Que’s wind-riding ambition still fell short.
To write of peace too vast for words—
Let the world sing its praises as it will.

**Teaching My Son**
To master oneself is rare among thousands.
Though one knows, speak as if one does not;
The difference lies in action, not inaction.
Only the comprehensive is called talent’s bloom,
Only the outstanding, a treasure at the feast.
How far apart are good and evil—
Some by nature, some by diligence.

**Arm Pain**
First the head-wind afflicted this ailing frame,
Now arm pain—what more can come?
No hindrance to the cup, only to bowing;
Though hair goes unkempt, books remain unneglected.
No need to seek cures in medicine—
Laughter and talk will dispel it all.
All things age and fall ill;
Why should man alone escape?

**The World’s Ways**
Only by stealing leisure does one find it—
I was born into an unhurried life.
Time is finite, all return to age,
But boundless wind and moon console the face.
Beyond my seat, only water and bamboo;
Ascending heights, only clouds and mountains.
Drunk, I sleep beneath the blossoms—
Only when the blossoms fade does the dream end.

**Rhapsody on Untrammeled Writing**
Who says the phoenix nests on Cinnabar Peak?
Beneath my brush, its nine plumes appear.
A single line, when apt, transforms like a tiger;
A grand composition, as if by divine communion.
A thousand patterns, like Sichuan brocade in new designs,
Ten thousand trees, their branches warmed by spring.
The heavenly steed leaves no trace across the eight poles—
Only the wind and moon, struck like chimes.

**Two Poems on the Whirlwind**

**I**
How can there be peace if men are not at peace?
Where hearts are level, strife cannot arise.
I shun the schemes of chess,
But delight in the words of the lute.
In youth, my heart clung to imperial canons;
In age, my thoughts rest on sacrificial rites.
I know where true achievement lies—
Pines and cassia show their green in deepest winter.

**II**
Pines and cassia show their green in deepest winter,
While mugwort and reeds flourish in summer’s height.
Once time has passed, the rope cannot strike;
Before gain and loss, men must contend.
In doubt, move not;
In fortune, walk always.
Men’s hearts are not so far apart—
How can there be peace if men are not at peace?

**Two More Poems**

**I**
Lately, illness has assailed this failing frame—
Why seek no medicine?
Before the pavilion, dense leaves form a canopy;
Beneath the steps, yellow blossoms scatter like gold.
Watching bees gather honey,
Observing swallows build their nests—
Not that the world lacks kindred spirits,
But that Yaofu plays the lute poorly.

**II**
Yaofu plays the lute poorly,
Not that the world lacks kindred spirits.
Old age cannot do what youth does;
Youth does not know the heart of age.
To nurture the spirit, sit in stillness;
To harmonize the mind, delight in pure chant.
Why seek no medicine?
Lately, illness has assailed this failing frame.

**Head-Wind**
Lately, the head-wind is unbearable—
Yet talk and laughter, song remain unchecked.
Men’s talents differ little,
But how much do matters truly contend?
Eyes closed, all before me is darkness;
Heart open, beyond the heavens—nothing else.
If all were won by cunning and calculation,
Many a hero would excel at scheming.

**Answering a Guest**
Speakers always overstate—
The Way must be rolled up, then unfurled.
Good things in the world are not constant;
Where in the world are there no extraordinary talents?
Nearing old age, I roam freely with my staff;
When poems please me, I take up the brush.
Yet even joy may feel constrained—
So I write wild verses in bold script.

**Growing Old**
Old, without achievement, out of step with the times,
In middle age, nursing illness, I only chant poems.
Following my thoughts, I seek release—
How could I stir trouble with words?
The world’s idle sorrows are all the same;
What more can one do in this life?
Leaning on my staff, I walk at dusk by the Tianjin Bridge—
I tell the gulls: beware, do not fly.

At sixty-three, twenty-five years in Luoyang.
In the quiet woods, the city yields mountain views;
By the level pond, my seat overlooks river lands.
Admiring blossoms, I am ever vexed by cups and plates;
Loving the moon, I am often wounded by wind and dew.
Seeing the boundless goodness of peace—
What matter if this body grows old?

**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi, Judicial Commissioner**

One good deed is already excellence—
How can it match your hundredfold cultivation?
Long ago, your kind mother’s love detained you;
For years, the official path held no allure.
Your talent ranks low, but your virtue stands alone;
Your post differs, yet the academy honors your white hair.
Too long has the Luoyang circle kept us apart—
So much joy, now to be set aside.

**Understanding Things**
One who understands things is called perceptive;
One who knows the times is called wise.
Wisdom, misapplied, becomes harm;
Perception, overdone, loses its purity.

**Few Joys**
Why strive for fame or profit?
Why, sir, do you have so few joys?
To value oneself by the Way is right—
To be entangled in the unreasonable is meaningless.
The tale of ascending to heaven by daylight may be false,
But who has ever been drunk exchanging gold marten for wine?
Who says cares weigh more than mountains?
They are but commonplace in this world.

**Rising from Illness**
Illness began a month ago through procrastination—
Who knew it would linger so painfully?
Morning and evening, food is hard to take;
This frail body defies description.
Yet I urge guests to raise their cups,
And take up my brush to write poems.
Only then do I know the heart commands the qi—
When the heart is glad, even deep illness dissolves.

**Half-Drunk**
Half-drunk, I mount the carriage,
The carriage rolls smoothly home.
A light breeze greets my face,
Green willows brush my head.

If the mind embraces three affairs,
And the heart commands nine banners—
Such idle wealth and honor,
I wager none could fathom.

**Half-Drunk in a Small Carriage**
Half-drunk, I ride in a small carriage,
A glory unmatched in this world.
A gentle breeze brushes my face,
Weeping willows lightly graze my head.

If the mind embraces three affairs,
And the heart commands ten thousand troops—
Such idle wealth and honor,
I wager none would contest.

**Gazing in the Mirror**
At dawn, I gaze in the mirror and see a hoary head,
Delighted to find myself suddenly an immortal old man.
Boldly, I dare to speak for all under heaven,
Clearly voicing the lofty Dao of this world.
Though the world itself is fundamentally without trouble,
Still, the world ever abounds with worthies.
I ask myself: what use is this body?
This body is fit only for old forests and springs.

**On Human Malice**
A human life spans a hundred years,
Yet how many hardships lie within?
Now at sixty-three,
I have passed more than half.
Though my bones grow gaunt, it is no sign of purity;
Though my hair turns white, it is no measure of years.
Even if I were to transform now, it would not be untimely—
How much more so when I remain roughly hale and hearty.

**On Old Age**
My body ages in an era of peace,
My body is idle, my heart even more so.
Neither noble nor base,
Neither hungry nor cold.
When guests arrive, I must pour wine;
No day passes without a smile.
The first and smoothest path—
Who will accompany me on my way?

**On the Ancient Zither**
Long have I kept books and chess by my side,
And though poor, I have long treasured this too.
Its pegs carved from green jade,
Its markers inlaid with gold.
Often pawned to entertain guests,
Rarely played to seek understanding.
Lately, my servants are wicked—
I must guard against the day they boil the crane.

**Seeking Trust**
At first, I sought others’ trust,
Some knew, some did not.
Then I sought to trust myself,
And many came to know me.
Now I seek no trust at all—
Who would still raise doubts?
With nothing that must be, nothing that must not,
Wherever I go, all is harmony.

**On Scorpions and Snakes**
Snake venom strikes from afar,
Scorpion venom brings death near.
Though snake and scorpion differ,
Their venom is no different.
The snake strikes with its head,
The scorpion wields its tail.
Alas, in this world between heaven and earth,
One fears both head and tail.

**On Freedom**
The heart is but an inch wide,
Yet why do the two hands cling so?
The body spans but a few feet,
Yet why do the two feet tread so narrowly?
Who does not drink wine?
Who does not read books?
Alas, in this world between heaven and earth,
Only Yaofu is truly free.

**On Peace of Mind**
When the heart is at peace, the body is at ease;
When the body is at ease, the room feels spacious.
When both heart and body are at peace,
What matter can disturb them?
Who says the body is small?
Its peace is like Mount Tai.
Who says the room is small?
Its spaciousness is like heaven and earth.

**On Poetry**
Why is it called poetry?
Poetry is the expression of one’s aspirations.
Once words form a composition,
They convey the matters of the heart.
Not only must the words be refined,
But the intent must be refined as well.
Refining words yields marvelous lines;
Refining intent yields lingering flavor.

**On Doing Good**
When one does good deeds,
Good deeds are right to perform.
Even metal and stone can be moved—
How could one deceive ghosts and spirits?
Act in accord with fate and virtue,
Speak from the depths of the liver and spleen.
Ask not of what lies beyond the self—
Whether others know or not.

**On the Moment**
When trouble comes again and again,
How can one act with true spontaneity?
Embrace the new with resolve,
Follow the good without delay.
Even thieves have their own Dao,
Yet some men lack humaneness.
Virtue has no fixed form—
Where one dwells in peace, there lies the path.

**Chance Reflections**
The sun is the essence of all images,
Man is the spirit of all things.
All images and all things
Are born of heaven.
Words gain trust through man,
The moon shines by the sun.
Through man and through the sun,
How could there not be great peace?

**On Sitting in Stillness**
Life is fated from birth,
All things are fixed from their origin.
Who says man is the most spiritually endowed,
Yet falls short of things’ true nature?
Some say yin harbors ghosts,
Which can bring a man to death.
If death has its cause,
What is there to seek beyond it?
Moreover, man’s fate
Is struck by heaven, not by others.
If yin ghosts possess power,
What can they do against heaven alone?

**On the Joy of Stillness**
Harmonious qi is even through the four seasons—
What time is not spring?
Transforming the joy of nothingness
Into a tangible form.
Quietly appraising things in poetry,
Leisurely expounding principles to the heart—
Though there be no drums or pipes,
This joy is unmatched in the world.

**On Being a True Man**
To be a true man,
One must complete four tasks.

**On Wealth, Beauty, Fame, and Power**
Wealth can make men greedy,
Beauty can make men lustful,
Fame can make men arrogant,
Power can make men reliant.
Once these four perils are wholly cast aside,
What need remains in the dust of the world?

**Longing for Rain**
In the height of summer, rain has long withheld,
And all beneath heaven are steeped in sorrow.
How might a single cloud arise
To bring salvation to the human realm?
Though long drought at last yields rain,
And joy briefly soothes the ache of want—
It may settle the dust,
But cannot save the withering grain.

**On Weighing Righteousness**
The petty man, by nature, lacks discernment,
Seeing only profit as his guide.
The noble man, by nature, does not deceive,
Yet when gain appears, he weighs it against righteousness.
To ponder righteousness is to disregard death,
To see profit may make one forget life.
These two arise from
The level and the uneven.

**On Gold and Silk**
Gold and silk are but one kind of thing,
Yet their use is never constant.
As gifts, they are called "offerings";
As ashes, they are called "remnants";
In trade, they are called "goods";
In hoarding, they are called "treasure";
As bribes, they are called "graft";
In theft, they are called "plunder."

**The Bandit Lord’s Lament**
The Bandit Lord eyes wealth and goods,
His mind fixed on nothing else.
When taking, he fears it is too little;
When caught, he regrets it is too much.
The Bandit Lord eyes wealth and goods,
His mind set only on accumulation.
If only his greed when taking
Were like his regret when caught!

**On Treating Things**
In dealing with things, nothing surpasses sincerity—
Sincerity alone moves all under heaven.
The feelings of things know no distance,
The Dao of heaven makes itself clear.
One must attend to principle and righteousness,
And never boast of one’s abilities.
The world’s idle adornments
Are but empty names in the end.

**On Yao and Shun**
The eyes of all under heaven serve as eyes,
And are called "illuminating the four directions."
The ears of all under heaven serve as ears,
And are called "penetrating the four quarters."
In former years, tassels and floss were bestowed,
Valued for their lack of partiality.
To act without acting, yet nothing is left undone—
Knowing this, one does not live in vain.

**On Airing Books**
Bookworms do little harm,
But men who worm through books do great harm.
Bookworms may be banished by airing,
But what of men who worm through books?

**On Rain’s Trespass**
Such endeavors are hard for others to follow,
This skill is not passed down through the world.
To know heaven by peering through the window is common,
But to know heaven without peering—that is true knowledge.

**Lamenting Drought**
Just when rain is needed, it does not fall,
And where disaster has struck, it strikes again.
How is it that the hundred grains near ruin,
While only mugwort and weeds cover the land?

**On Idleness**
All things under heaven are like a grindstone,
Caught in the mechanism of withering and flourishing, gain and loss.
There is but one thing without counterpart—
It is as when heaven and earth were yet undivided.

**The Gatekeeper Invites a Friend**
A gentle breeze stirs, soft and clear,
A small pavilion overlooks the thoroughfare.
I do not wish to enjoy it alone for long—
Can you come and share it with me?

**Recalling a Dream**
Though the household is poor, the heart is content,
Though the body is coarse, the affection is deep.
Opening one’s robe reveals gaunt bones,
Speaking reveals a nature unspoiled.

**On Writing in Large Characters**
A poem composed, written in bold script—
Who else knows such exhilaration?
Waves like silver mountains rise,
Masts towering over a hundred feet.
Delighting in small cups of wine,
Composing poems in large characters—
In all the world of men,
Who else knows such joy?

**Rejoicing in Oneself**
The common folk flourish, knowing your virtue,
The times are harmonious, witnessing the emperor’s merit.
I, an old man born of humble tile,
Live out my days in this age of peace.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Eleven Concludes*
*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Twelve*

**Dream Within a Dream**
In dreams, one often speaks of dreaming,
Who knows the thoughts upon waking?
Unknowing, is this present moment also a dream?
Then speak again of the time within dreams.

**Midday**
Midday is for *Shi He*,¹
Exchange is the common way.
They know not one another,
Why ponder further?

**Moonlight Upon the Wuyan Tree²**
The moon reaches the wutong tree,
The wind comes by the willow’s side.
The courtyard deep, the people still—
With whom to share this scene?

**Walking in Moonlight**
Through the forest’s clefts, the sky grows ever bluer,
After the wind, the moon shines brighter.
On days when the world knows no trouble,
One may wander here at will.

**An Occasional Verse**
In this world, affairs are hard to settle,
In this world, matters are hard to secure.
There is a man whose name I know not,
In stillness, I see him idly wield his whisk.

**In Reply to a Question**
Idle words beneath the trees—
Why ask further what they mean?
I know myself to lack all discipline,
How can this be called poetry?

**To Li Shenyan, Dragon Diagram Scholar of Caozhou³**
What once was said to be right,
Now proves to be wrong.
How know that today is right,
And not give rise to later doubt?

What once was said to be me,
Now proves to be you.
Not knowing who I am today,
Who will it be later on?

**A Clear Night’s Verse**
The moon reaches the heart of heaven,
The wind comes to the water’s surface.
The same pure flavor—
Few, I think, truly know it.

**Thinking of the Sage**
Never meeting the Sage in his time,
Never seeing the Sage’s face.
Yet the Sage’s words may be heard,
The Sage’s heart may be seen.

**The Noble Man**
The noble man upholds the great essence,
The petty man lacks constancy.
He seeks no perfection in others,
And fears only to receive too much kindness.

**Contentment**
Content with one’s lot, the body knows no shame,
Aware of the subtle, the heart is at ease.
Though dwelling in the world of men,
One is as if beyond it.

**Reflections on Affairs**
The four seas, the three rivers, the five lakes—
All are linked by boats, not by carts.
Countless travelers pass in peace—
Can this all be due to a single censer’s incense?

**Ascending the Stone Pavilion**
A single sentiment, hard to restrain,
I have long feared climbing high to gaze afar.
Today, leaning on the railing, unlike other days,
How many times have I nearly descended—yet linger still.

**Recalling the Past**
Recalling when I first wrote in large characters,
Learning from men who drank wine and composed poems.
Had not true friends urged me on like metal and stone,
Forty-five years would have passed in vain.

**Certainty**
Certainly, in this world, only good deeds,
Not by heaven or earth, but by one’s own heart.
Do not cease because the effect seems distant—
Strive further, and greater merit will come.

**The Vague and Indistinct**
Vague and indistinct, yin and yang first transform,
Misty and swirling, heaven and earth begin their revolutions.
Amidst them, a fleeting moment of fine scenery—
How to find the skill to put it into words?

**Thanking Junshi and Duanning for Their Poems**
They say Kunlun abounds in fine jade,
The world tells of the bright pearls of the deep sea.
Such tales may lack proof,
But what I keep at home is no empty claim.

**On Courage**
One who excels me in courage—
When it comes to benevolence, how could I yield to a teacher?
Courage must be tempered by benevolence,
Benevolence must rely on courage.

**None Like**
None are as close as father and son,
None as distant as the barbarian tribes.
Yet even barbarians may reach harmony,
While father and son may part in estrangement.

None are as kind as father and son,
None as righteous as lord and minister.
If even these two may fail,
What need to speak of the rest?

Lord and minister uphold righteousness,
Father and son uphold kindness.
If righteousness is lost, they become enemy states,
If kindness is lost, they become strangers on the road.

**Neighborhood**
Neighbors passing time in leisure—
A flourishing sign of great peace.
My village abounds in good men,
All the more unlike other lands.

A flourishing sign of great peace,
The world’s finest talents.
On days when the world knows no trouble,
All come to Luoyang.

**Thinking of a Friend**
My desire to see you never ceases,
Yet long parted, what can be done of this feeling?
Though clouds and mist lie but a short distance away,
We cannot often meet.

**Loyalty and Trust**
Loyalty and trust are most sincere toward others,
In ordinary times, it is not that ghosts and spirits are slighted.
Why must they be reserved only for rivers and lakes,
And practiced only when hardship strikes close?

**In Reply to Zhang Chun, Secretarial Aide**
I fear to recall the past in old age,
All the more when I see the sorrowful poems of my late father.
Yet there is a broken verse that brings some comfort—
Now, whose descendants are weaker than mine?

**In Reply to Master Yin Chuchu**
A land of joy long allows men to avoid strife,
How else to describe a heart so pure?
Yet how dare I aspire to follow in such lofty footsteps?
One may scale perilous heights without need of steps.

**In Reply to Wang Maozhi’s Gift of Wine and Sichuan Paper**
White sheep’s jade dust is truly a fine thing,
Just when my arm aches and my head pains me.
Wine brings half a tipsy inspiration,
Why call a doctor when seclusion suffices?

**To the Gentlemen of the Anling County Registry**
Beneath the brocade-screened mountains, a fine place to dwell,
Where flowers, moon, wind, and mist remain unchanged.
I hear that lately, those with long sleeves pass by,
Lingering before the woods on horseback for hours.

**Human Sentiments**
Ancient affairs compared to present ones—
People of today are but people of old.
Only if feelings are not yet fully shared,
Once shared, they naturally draw close.

**Why So?**
Why is the plum tart?
Why is salt salty?
Why is tea bitter?
Why is shepherd’s purse sweet?

**Heaven’s Hearing**
Heaven’s hearing is silent, without sound,
Where in the vast blue to seek it?
Neither high nor far—
It lies entirely in the human heart.

**White-Haired**
Though the five blessings⁴ are hard to attain in full,
The three misfortunes⁵ have not befallen me.
On days of great peace, without trouble,
I become a white-haired old man.

**Heaven’s Will**
Men can speak and thus perceive,
Heaven’s will is wordless—do not deceive it.
Do not say that silence means nothing happens—
This is hardly something the common crowd can know.

**Thanking the Magistrate of Shou’an for the Deed to Shenlin Mountain**
In the southwest stands a towering mountain,
Its jagged peaks encircling like Penglai.⁶
Within lies a place fit to dwell,
Where springs are sweet, trees lush, and dust does not rise.
How generous is the intent of you gentlemen,
Who swiftly agreed and granted it like thunder.
When the waves of Tianjin calm in the eighth month,
I may take a raft and visit it once.

**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi, Junior Vice Minister, Who Teased That Anzhi Was Not Abandoning Yaofu**
Anzhi has not abandoned Yaofu,
Yet fears others may slander him deeply.
Kaishu once spoke and was found at fault,
Xi Chun later said he was innocent.
Our feelings remain as before,
And suddenly, cups and plates are brought out again.

I now believe your heart remains steadfast through the cold years,
And Yaofu has not been abandoned by you.

**Chant of the Small Cart**
Since thrice I snapped the leather bindings of my books,
Twelve years have passed without reading.
The long days dissolve in the great *□* son’s chamber,
While from the small cart I gaze upon the azure sky.
Leisurely, I become master of waters, bamboos, clouds, and mountains;
Quietly, I gain sway over wind, flowers, snow, and moon.
In the space between bowing and rising, all is joy—
Let others say I resemble an immortal.

**Evening Stroll Chant**
An evening stroll on Shangyang Dyke,
Staff of *qiong* bamboo in hand.
Silently following the fragrant grasses,
Leisurely chasing the wild clouds home.
The moon emerges above the pine tips,
The wind arrives at the duckweed’s edge.
Such scenes within the grove—
How many truly know them?

**Plucking Flowers Chant**
Things exist for the myriad people,
Humans are the spirits of all things.
Humans cannot live without things,
Things flourish only through humans.
Male and female are born of Heaven,
Husband and wife are made by humans.
Beyond Heaven and humans,
All else is but empty name.

**In Reply to Gentleman Ren Kaishu and His Brother’s Visit**
Bamboo shadows flicker as the game of chess ends,
Idle thoughts drift to the Nest of Peace.
Long unseen in these quiet times,
Yet fortune brings you riding side by side.
Your favor cannot be matched by gold,
Nor your praise surpassed by embroidered robes.
Ever fond of poetry,
You’ve led me into this enchantment.

**Minor Spring Days**
The eighth month, a minor springtime,
Like a man in his vigorous youth.
To eke out life is indeed meaningful,
Yet to reverse aging remains beyond reach.
If one possesses the arts of immortals,
Even grasses and trees may bloom anew.
Who knows if in days of great peace,
The world may resemble Yao’s reign?

**Deep Autumn Chant**
All year round, no affairs trouble me,
Flowers bloom in all four seasons.
The small cart carries me forth in high spirits,
Wherever I arrive feels like home.

**Mid-Autumn Chant**
Mid-autumn’s light is fine,
All the more so with the moon full and round.
Most people cherish such moments,
Yet how can one bear solitude?
Clear skies and good company,
Fine wine and a body at ease—
If any of these four are lacking,
This joy cannot be complete.

**Chant While Strolling by the Moonlit Pond with Gentleman Cheng and His Son**
Grass soft, sand smooth, wind gently flowing,
Clouds light, sun pale, willows gently swaying.
Wild words unremembered—what was said?
Deep drinking never matched this cup.
The scene is fine, so we wander at leisure,
Friends’ joy—how could we not open our hearts?
We vow to savor such delightful moments,
Yet fear such delights may not soon return.

**Autumn Gazing Chant**
Grass color blends with cloud color,
Mountain light meets water light.
A towering pavilion, a hundred feet high,
A few lines of wild geese in flight.

**Leisure Chant**
In spring, I admire Luoyang’s flowers;
In autumn, I play beneath Tianjin’s moon.
In summer, I don the winds of Song Mountain;
In winter, I delight in Longshan’s snow.

**On Viewing Master Chen Xiyi’s Portrait and Calligraphy**
Never seen Xiyi’s true form,
Never seen Xiyi’s traces;
Only heard Xiyi’s name,
Yet Xiyi’s heart remains unknown.
Until I saw Xiyi’s traces,
And then beheld Xiyi’s true form.
Only then did I know that through past and present,
The world has always had such men.
Xiyi’s true form is worth beholding,
Xiyi’s ink may be passed down.
Xiyi’s heart—a single piece—
Cannot be spoken, yet cannot be unspoken.

**In Reply to Junshi, Minister Duanming, on His Visit to the Divine Forest of Du’an**
I have claimed a secluded mountain for my dwelling,
Far removed from the dust of profit and fame.
The four seasons determine my wanderings,
Unmoved even by summons to come and go.

**Apricot Blossoms Fragrance**
A guest speaks of affairs in some prefecture,
Schemes endless, boundless.
I, startled, remain silent—
Only greedy to inhale the apricot’s fragrance.

**Evening Stroll at Tianjin**
The *zhi*-canopied carriages long since sparse,
Evening clouds stretch empty to the north.
This thousand-year-old imperial city,
A single stretch of idle palaces and towers.
The imperial parks still extend,
The towering eaves remain jagged.
The bridge arches like a rainbow,
The dyke curves like the new moon.
The banks of the winding stream have deepened,
The Han and Tang eras have long since faded.
A lone figure sits in the high pavilion,
Idly witnessing the rise and fall of dynasties.

**Joyful Chant**
The sun departs, the moon arrives,
An end gives way to a new beginning.
Half its journey in the heavens,
Half beneath the earth.
In its illumination,
There is no sorrow, only joy.
Who am I?
Yet joy ceaselessly fills me.

**Self-Portrait Eulogy**
Pine and cassia in conduct,
Oriole and flower in literary talent.
The bearing of rivers and mountains,
The sentiments of wind and moon.
Borrowing your visage,
Assuming your form.
In the leisure of the Nine’s remainder,
I come and go at ease.
(The Nine refers to the Supreme Ultimate.)

**Extravagance Chant**
Extravagance must not reach its limit,
Luxury must not be exhausted.
To reach the limit is to invite disaster,
To exhaust it is to court calamity.

**Abundance Chant**
In the world’s ordinary state,
Harm outweighs benefit,
Chaos outweighs order,
Sorrow outweighs joy.
How can human life
Escape this?
How can my life
Be consumed by external matters?

**Fear and Love Chant**
Humans possess true nature,
And all things align.
Humans lack true nature,
And all things fall into ruin.
Failing in benevolence,
Wrong is taken for right.
Failing in authority,
Right is taken for wrong.
With benevolence and authority lost,
What do fear and love know?
Unknowing of fear and love,
What use are benevolence and authority?
Unrestrained joy and anger—
Few avoid this fate.
Men and women alike
Should take heed.

**Autumn Pavilion**
Leaning on the autumn pavilion’s railing,
The human heart—how still it feels.
Heaven and Earth in this year’s months,
Tang and Han in these ancient mountains and rivers.
The pale sun before the frost,
The sparse sky after the rain.
Even the finest painter’s brush
Cannot capture this sentiment.

**Floating Life Chant**
Life floats at dawn’s edge,
Grateful to add another year.
Movement may bring regret,
Seeking perfection may not bring wholeness.
Matters of the human heart,
Words of the nature of things.
Though the world is vast,
Who can say it is not so?

**Beyond Strength Chant**
To make little seem much,
To make nothing seem something.
Striving beyond one’s strength
Cannot last long.

**In Gratitude to Academician Fu Qinzhi for His Visit**
Nothing is longer than Heaven,
Nothing greater than Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth have limits,
How can the rest be worth calculating?
Worldly attitudes shift in an instant,
Human feelings stop at this.
Even in achieving great deeds,
One relies on mighty influence.
If fortune aligns,
Take care not to force matters.
Though stern as frost and snow,
Remain unchanging as pine and cassia.
Just as I lament our long separation,
I rejoice in your arrival by way of principle.
Twenty years apart,
Yet you still recall my haggard face.

**Snow Appreciation Chant**

**Snowflakes and Wine**

One flake, two flakes—snow drifts down,
Three cups, five cups—wine warms the brow.
Such scenes defy all description,
As if heaven and earth had just begun their weaving.

**In Reply to Fu Qinzhi**

Qinzhi said to me:
"To chant many poems is not as good as chanting few;
To chant few poems is not as good as chanting none."
I said to Qinzhi:
"Neither many nor few,
Neither none nor must—
Yet chant I do.
Orchids in the room cannot but fragrance spread,
Bronze and stone struck cannot but sound be made.
For evil, grieve—but not to excess;
For good, rejoice—but not to indulgence."

**Strolling by Moonlit Pond**

Following fragrant grasses, I wander far,
Lingering for love of clear ripples, I return late.
Walking alone, chanting alone, sitting alone,
In the season’s first coolness, ere winter’s chill.

**Chant on Confucius**

Confucius was born in Lu, before my time,
A thousand and five hundred years since the Sage’s light.
Who today can grasp this Dao?
In his day, men compared him to Heaven.
Kings and emperors ruled the Central Plains,
Fathers and sons, lords and ministers—power passed down for ages.
The River yields no chart; I accept this fate,
Yet the meaning of refining the Classics was never in vain.

**In Gratitude to Monk Yuanyi for His Gift of a Poetry Scroll**

Reading ten of your poems,
How they stir my thoughts!
Like medicine dispelling doubt’s sickness,
Like tea banishing sleep’s demons.
The moon hangs bright above the pines,
Mountains rise steep beyond the waters.
Tomorrow, if time allows,
I may cross Tianjin Bridge again.

**Self-Portrait (Two Poems)**

What is passed down is prized at the feast,
All because in those days I found a true teacher.
I know now that none indulge me like the old,
And I rejoice in a heart as free as spring.
If fortune favors, I’ll serve the realm’s affairs;
Retired, I’ll be a man of mist and waves.
Within my breast, one clear and steadfast point—
Unbetraying of high heaven, unbetraying of men.

A dragon of land and sea, claws sheathed,
A crane of boundless skies, feathers folded.
Hard to match the steed galloping a thousand *li* a day,
Easy to content the wren nesting on a single branch.
Best of all is kindred spirits in carefree ease,
Climbing high towers and terraces together.
We’ve roamed every fine place among clouds and hills—
Who else is as leisurely as I?

**In Reply to Accountant Du Xiaoyou, Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, for His Gift of Poems**

Good men abound in every quarter,
Yet I possess not a hair’s worth of goodness.
With intent I seek the empty Way,
Without merit I idly love the noble.
Strolling, I watch the still waters;
Sitting, I gaze at the returning clouds.
Old, I live in an age of peace,
Where the court esteems culture and learning.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Twelve Concludes*

**For the Kindness of Various Gentlemen in Jointly Purchasing a Garden at Tianjin’s Humble Abode**

Deep gratitude to the gentlemen who bought this garden—
Within the city walls, a grove and spring now lie mine.
Seven thousand paces of level flowing water,
Over twenty households pooled their silver bright.
In Jiayou’s time, I leased a dwelling by divination’s sign;
In Xining’s reign, the deed was mine to claim alone.
Beneath Phoenix Tower, a newfound idle guest,
In Morality Lane, an old immortal roams.
From Luo’s banks, the morning breeze fills my sleeves;
From Song’s peaks, the moon’s glow spills through my hall.
By the fence, I wear lotus and water-chestnut askew;
In the willows’ shade, I shake the dust from talk so light.
The streets stretch past bronze camels, flowers ablaze,
The dike joins Golden Vale, where grasses spread like silk.
Though spring’s youth lingers, I may yet venture forth,
The sun rides high, yet still I lie abed.
The cave named "Long Life" should have its master true,
The nest called "Peaceful Joy"—who holds its sway?
Dare I open wide my eyes upon the world,
To see the heavens anew in this human fray?
All time I pour into the winecup’s gleam,
All creation I shift into verse’s frame.
I know this patch of earth is fine indeed—
Worthy of Yaofu’s brush, broad as a beam.

**Ten Poems on Viewing Plum Blossoms at Zhang Garden South of the City**
*Two Poems in Response to Prefect Li Zizhen of Changshui, Matching His Rhymes*

The east wind overnight split the plum branches wide,
Butterflies and bees dance on, unaware.
I’ve stuck them in my hair and steeped them in wine—
Let others say I’m out of step with the times.

Plucked and sniffed, then sniffed again,
I cherish this fleeting fragrance, pure and keen.
Thanks to the host’s deep kindness,
Though the blossoms fade, he bids me come again.

Cool fragrance, pale beauty—here they thrive,
No storm or gale has marred their prime.
As the sun dips low, our joy runs deep,
Yet how, once gone, a year slips by in time?

When the red sun sinks, our passion burns brighter still,
As jade mountains crumble, our spirits rise.
I choose the fullest branch to break and wear—
Not to crown my head, but to soothe this heart of mine.

After the plum terrace’s feast, what lingers in the mind?
Returning, I tuck plum blossoms in my carriage small.
Passersby on the road may well laugh and stare—
Yaofu’s romantic heart is no slight thing at all.

Steeped in wine, their scent grows fiercer yet,
Played on the flute, their notes ring clearer still.
This fragrance, this music—where they come from is fine,
Worthy of a moment’s deep and frozen thrill.

Spring comes early, plum blossoms blaze,
Though I’ve never been one to drink, I raise my cup.
All day on the high terrace south of the city,
As if I’d journeyed once more to Jiangnan’s shores.

Four kinds of plum—some yellow, some red,
Their hues differ, yet their fragrance is one.
Even from afar, I must return again,
To watch them drift on the wind, drift on the sun.

Though the Five Ridges boast many sights,
The Three Rivers, though few, demand another gaze.
By the terrace, thousands of trees stand,
Deep in the heart of this famed garden’s maze.
Fine things in this world are ever to be prized,
Rare talents in the realm are not lightly found.
When next we meet in some distant place,
We’ll know this gathering was rare and profound.

Who says the idle man holds no sway?
His sway lies only in the poem’s sway.
The four seasons’ scenes—snow, moon, wind, and flowers—
All are gathered in these recent lines.

When early spring came to Luoyang’s walls,
I viewed the plums and chanted plum-blossom verse.
Though the plum blooms could not be sent afar,
I sent plum poems to convey my thoughts dispersed.

**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Wine**

The spring wind scatters snow in wild disarray,
How can the woods below not feel forlorn?
The frost’s authority is stern, hard to defy—
A petty man’s gift is hard to repay in kind.

---

**For Secretary Shou’an, Who Sent a Silk Screen from Beneath Jinxia Mountain, Where My Lost Scissors Were Found**

Jiangxia could still mourn a fallen shoe,
Shaoyuan wept only for a lost hairpin.
A single pair of scissors—what’s the loss?
Yet they were long used, and bore my heart within.

---

**For Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Eight Kinds of Mountain Vegetables**

Eight kinds of mountain greens, all medicinal sprouts,
Each plucked from its peak, each bearing its name.
The mountain elder, startled by the frost-terrace’s gift,
Bade his mountain wife prepare them herself.

---

**For Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Peonies**

From what frost-terrace did this rare bloom arise?
Sent to the hermit by Tianjin’s stream.
My wife, startled, rushed to see—
She’s only ever pinned sunflowers, it would seem.

---

**For Prefect Wang Xuanhui for His Gift of Wine**

I’d just plucked a flower branch for a distant neighbor,
Fearing I’d lightly waste this spring’s embrace.
Then came the honor of your gift—two jars of wine,
And the man of Shaoshi Mountain is no longer poor in grace.

---

**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of Protocol, on Viewing Flowers in Luoyang**

Luoyang holds the finest harmony of qi,
Every blade of grass, each tree, invites the gaze.
Even drinking water brings boundless joy—
Brother, you often raise your cup in praise.

Luoyang’s flowers and trees are famed throughout the land,
Our wanderings surpass the scholars’ own.
Mindful of the East Lord’s charge,
How could we not linger where beauty’s shown?

Luoyang’s friends are all remarkable men,
Taking turns to visit gardens as if they were home.
I laugh at Meng Jiao, so unused to poverty,
Who boasted of seeing all Chang’an’s blooms in a day alone.

The southern garden is planted all in peach and plum,
When spring arrives, we hope the flowers bloom soon.
Thanks to the host’s deep kindness,
The guest from Tianjin does not come lightly to this boon.

---

**Matching Rhymes with Junshi, Minister of Protocol, for His Gift of Wine**

Most men’s hearts are easily made proud,
Two combs are not as fine as a single gourd.
I fear Meng Guang’s heart grows ever more extravagant—
From now on, she may scorn even purple lingzhi shoots.

---

**Chant of Late Spring**

In the woods, I often rise from sleep late,
Now even the carriages and horses grow rare.
Spring deepens, the days lengthen, the curtains hang low,
In the windless courtyard, flowers drift through the air.

---

**Matching Rhymes with Vice-Marshal Gong Zhang of Zhenrong Garrison**

Fifteen years ago, I first met you,
And from that meeting, our bond felt like kin.
Though in the woods there’s little to do,
My heart cannot help but long for old friends again.

Comparing all things to their very core,
Even red sincerity must yield to truth’s pure light.
Among the gatherings of Luoshe, none compare—
When will you come to choose a neighboring site?

---

**Inscription for the Nest of Peaceful Joy**

Nothing is more secure than a kingdom at peace,
Nothing more joyful than a year of harvest’s grace.
If the kingdom is not at peace, the year brings no yield,
How can this nest know health and ease?

---

**Chant of Sorrow and Regret**

I dwell in the city amidst mist and clouds,
A small hermit by Tianjin’s tide.
My work is the classics, my study profound,
My life is water and bamboo, side by side.

Regret that clouds veil the moon,
Sorrow that wind mars the flowers’ face.
Beyond these regrets, beyond this gloom,
What else in the world has time or space?

**Lament and Joy**

When Wu Qi first left Wei,
When Zhang Yi suddenly entered Qin.
The Western River long received kindness,
Southern Chu was deceived again and again.

**Chant of Good and Evil**

The noble person studies the Dao and attends to fundamentals,
The petty person, seeing profit, forgets even life.
Attending to fundamentals, they do not move against principle,
Seeing profit, they do not act without bribes.

**Chant of What Is Learned**

What people learn,
Is fundamentally to learn human affairs.
If human affairs are not cultivated,
What difference is there in learning nothing?

**The Noble Person’s Conduct**

What makes a noble person?
A noble person is surely one who cultivates themselves.
Knowing the noble person’s path,
One makes others wish to follow and wander with them.
They side with righteousness, not profit,
Remember kindness, not enmity.
They praise goodness, not fear evil,
Favor joy, not sorrow.

**Chant of Reflection**

Confucius reflected twice,
Zengzi thrice examined himself.
Who am I?
How dare I forget self-cultivation?

**Chant of the Soaring Kite**

Who says things have no knowledge?
Autumn departs, spring returns—never missing their time.
This year’s new fledglings have grown,
When they leave, how can they not feel deep attachment?

**The Two Grudges of Zou and Tian**

Zou and Tian bore grudges against each other,
The diviner’s words—how could they be trusted?
Profit and harm injure truth to this extent,
The Tian family departed, their resentment hard to pacify.

**The Two Generals Sun and Pang**

Sun Bin lay in ambush, his strategy called masterful,
Pang Juan drilled into fire—how foolish!
All military strategists are deceitful like this,
Yet profit and harm remain unchanged today.

**A Single Word Moves a Person**

Not marrying as a woman,
Not taking office as a scholar,
A single word from a man of Qi,
And Tian Zi resigned.

**Chant of the Four Lords**

The age departed from the Three Kings,
Affairs fell to the Five Hegemons.
The Seven Warring States contended,
The Four Lords still vied in splendor.
Mengchang stood first,
Xinling second,
Pingyuan in the middle,
Chunshen last.

**Chunyu Kun’s Admonition on Wine**

Wine bestowed by the lord,
Drunk without tasting its flavor.
The law’s enforcers stand before you,
Fear and dread know no end.
At such a time,
One cup and you are drunk.

The clan fills the hall,
Filial and fraternal,
Honoring elders, respecting the young,
Old and young in proper order.
At such a time,
Two cups and you are drunk.

At the guests’ first seating,
Solemn and dignified,
Toasts and bows in hundreds,
Rising and descending with ritual.
At such a time,
Three cups and you are drunk.

Neighbors gather,
Like brothers,
In times of harmony and harvest,
Hearts full of joy.
At such a time,
Five cups and you are drunk.

Friends come and go,
Discussing the Dao, seeking righteousness,
Delighting in good things, gladdening the heart,
Climbing mountains, facing waters.
At such a time,
Eight cups and you are drunk.

Men and women sit together,
Cups and goblets uncounted,
Lamps flicker,
Caps and robes askew.
At such a time,
A full *dan* and you are drunk.

**The Great Fish of the Eastern Sea**

In the Eastern Sea there is a great fish,
No net or snare can come near.
Once cast ashore,
Even ants can trap it.

**The Clay and Wooden Effigy**

Clay and wooden effigies,
Take care not to laugh at each other.
When heaven sends great rain,
You can only mourn each other.

**Chant of Defending Against Slander**

Tian Dan’s merit covered the state,
Diao Bo’s words turned the lord’s heart.
Slander has existed since ancient times,
Yet it could still kill nine men.

**Chant of the Three Sovereigns**

In the age of the Three Sovereigns, all was bright and harmonious,
Even the nests of magpies and crows could be peered into from below.

At that time, the feeling was just the same—
Early spring’s morning air, the season’s prime.

**Chant of the Five Emperors**

In the age of the Five Emperors, all was like midday’s glow,
With radiant culture and rites in full flow.
No era before or since has matched such grace,
Beyond this, all else falls from that place.

**Chant of the Three Kings**

The age of the Three Kings was like autumn’s reign,
With power’s weight and lightness, each had its claim.
Deep valleys became hills, cliffs turned to dells,
Ever shifting, the earth itself never stills.

**Chant of the Five Hegemons**

The time of the Five Hegemons was like winter’s hold,
Though of the Three Dynasties, none shared its mold.
Even then, Guan and Yan wielded power’s sway,
Where father and son, lord and minister, still held sway.

**Chant of the Seven States**

The Seven States’ schemes were plain to see,
As Su and Zhang rose—yet was this just decree?
In those days, how did the world align?
Men of the marketplace became ministers divine.

**Sweeping the Land Chant**

In Guan and Yan’s time, some order remained,
But Su and Zhang’s rise left no name unstained.
From whence came the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors’ line?
Sweep the Central Plains clean and await peace divine.

**Heaven and Man Chant**

Though Fu Xi, Yao, and Shun may never return,
Tang, Wu, Huan, and Wen’s paths still may be learned.
Times differ, affairs change—yet both align,
Part by Heaven’s Dao, part by man’s design.

**Profit and Harm Chant**

Hound and hare both perish,
Clam and snipe locked in strife.
The old fisherman sits,
Reaping gain from their life.

**Timeliness Chant**

In its prime, the steed’s speed
Outpaces all in its prime.
Yet in decline, even nags
Leave it far behind in time.
When time and task align,
A word or laugh suffices to command.
But when time shifts and tasks depart,
Even death serves no demand.

**Two Teachings Chant**

To govern without changing customs,
To teach without altering the people—
Gan Long’s words may yet hold sway.
The common folk cling to habit,
Scholars drown in what they’ve heard.
Shang Yang’s way stands apart—
Not as others have averred.

**Words and Deeds Chant**

Words that never stray from *ren*,
Deeds that never stray from *yi*—
Heaven itself will bless such men,
All good fortune shall be nigh.
Words that turn from *ren* away,
Deeds that stray from *yi*’s way—
Heaven will not bless such play,
Who then can such men obey?
There was Lord Shang, who spurned *yi*,
Ravaged *ren* with cruel decree.
His laws became his own undoing,
His body torn by chariots’ shearing.
Now we know: to walk in *yi*,
To cultivate *ren* with care,
Is to be a man who gains
Years added to his span.

**Order and Chaos Chant**

When profit leads the way,
When brush and tongue hold sway,
Famine follows close behind,
Bandits rise like swarming bees.
When filial piety leads the way,
Sun and moon shine long each day,
Years bring peace, the land is blessed,
Life is long, the body rests.

**Great Peace Chant**

The old find their care,
The young find their support,
The toiling find their fare,
The dead find their grave’s report.

**Lord Shang Chant**

Lord Shang won his lord’s trust, wielding law’s might,
Zhao Liang spoke truth day and night.
When his decrees burned like fire’s glow,
How could he know his body would be torn asunder so?

**He Who Holds the World in Heart**

He who holds the world in heart,
Who resolves the affairs of men—
Such a one plays his part.

**Is It Only for the Present?**

Is it only for the present one seeks?
Seeking the past is no easier feat.

**First Emperor Chant**

Nine thousand days he swallowed the land,
Fifteen years he ruled all under heaven.
The blood of the pit had not yet dried when Gaozu came,
And the mounds of Mount Li were already desolate.

**On Delusion Chant**

To feign virtue with cunning schemes,
To gloss over faults with hidden guile—
Though human hearts may be obscure,
The Dao of Heaven remains ever clear.
When hands and feet are all exposed,
How can mere words be trusted still?

**Heaven and Earth Chant**

With nine, the host of dragons appears,
Bringing forth the ten thousand things.
With six, eternal constancy is blessed,
For the firmness of Qian brings advantage.
The four images with nine complete
Make thirty-six in all.
The four images with six complete
Make twenty-four in sum.
How can nine and six alone
Encompass all the world’s affairs?

**Primordial Epoch of the *Supreme Principles Governing the World* Chant**

Heaven and earth are like a chariot’s canopy and axle,
Covering and bearing—how high, how vast?
Sun and moon are like ants on a millstone,
Endlessly circling without cease.
The years above and below,
Their numbers are hard to fathom.
Yet take but one epoch—
Its principles may still be known.
Twelve myriad, nine thousand six hundred,
And three thousand years between,
Up to the traces of today,
Order and chaos, rise and fall,
All are recorded in the annals.
I can grasp them as one thread,
As if I had lived them myself.

**Responsive Dragon Chant**

The dragon, creature of yang,
Moves in accord with the seasons,
First to emerge among the ten thousand things,
Roaming the six voids.
It can dive, it can rise,
It can inhale, it can exhale,
It can grow vast, it can shrink small,
It can be, it can cease to be.

**Where Lies the Land of Immortals?**

Where lies the land of immortals?
The land of immortals is not apart from this chamber.
Before the eyes, no tedium,
Within the heart, a cool clarity.
In stillness, heaven and earth are vast,
In leisure, sun and moon stretch long.
If one can find contentment here,
It surpasses all other thoughts.

**In Gratitude to Attendant Officer Song for the Gift of a White Ox**

Its coat like frost and snow, its eyes like crimson,
Ears and horns square and even, over three feet tall.
Its form is strange, its mouth fit to plow the wilds,
Its nature tame, well-suited to draw a carriage in peace.
Where it grazes by the water, even dragons yield,
When led beneath the moon, hares may be driven.
From now on, in the paintings of Luoyang,
The artist’s brush will strive anew.

**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi’s Poem on the Six Elders, Hastily Composed**

Six elders, hoary-haired, their temples like frost,
Their hearts at ease, though age may seem like folly.
Together they choose gardens and pools—what harm in delight?
With cups and platters they rejoice, never too busy.
With staff and sandals they wander through a thousand years’ fate,
Their robes and headscarves thick with the fragrance of ten thousand flowers.
Our gatherings, so freely given, now number seven—
And with autumn’s approach, the air grows cool.

**Six Elders, Joined by You and Your Son**

Six elders, joined by you and your son,
In leisurely posts, far from reckless abandon.
Gatherings without care are easily joyful,
Duties toward others are hard to call busy.
Tender willows droop, greener still,
Dew-kissed peaches blush, warm and fragrant.
Drunk in spring, lying beneath the blossoms,
Just as the shade brings its own cool.

**Who Among the Six Elders Yields to Youth?**

Who among the six elders yields to youth’s domain?
Age need not shame them—they indulge their whims.
Together in stillness, they watch things move,
In leisure, they observe others’ haste.
The heart of heaven, the full moon, the toad stirs,
On the water’s surface, the breeze, the lotus fragrance.
Who would believe there is sorrow in this world?
New wine is brewed, the scene is cool.

**Six Men Gather in Prosperous Times**

Six men gather in prosperous times—
What reason have they not to let loose?
Gardens and groves cover the land, all theirs to share,
Wind and moon fill the sky, aiding their poetic toil.
Their writings pluck the finest blooms of Han and Tang,
Their elegance is steeped in the fragrance of Li and Du.
By the water’s edge, beneath the bamboo, in ease—
No worldly dust, only cool clarity.

**Six Guests Roam a Land of Drunkenness**

Six guests roam a land of drunkenness,
Far from the madness of common speech.
Together they rejoice in long-lasting peace,
Vying in song and verse, seeking the finest lines.
By the moonlit pond, fruits ripen in the grove,
In Golden Valley’s well, the tea’s aroma rises.
Beneath the thousand-year pine, dust is swept away,
Sleeves and lapels, though windless, feel cool.

**The Rustic, Now Seventh Among the Elders**

The rustic, now seventh among the elders,
Knows only rustic, unrefined abandon.
Each day he arranges his verses with care,
Each year he hurries to seize his leisure.
At summer’s end, he delights in new wine’s taste,
At spring’s beginning, he loves the early plum’s fragrance.
Why must he do so?
He cannot bear the chill in his heart.

**Singing Wildly in the Forest, Unfettered by Rhyme**

Singing wildly in the forest, unshackled by rhyme—
How could such singing be called wild if bound by form?
Where the small carriage rolls, orioles and flowers clamor,
When the great brush falls, gods and ghosts scurry.
The gate is barred, the market’s din far off,
The wall is opened, the window a jar—ivy and vines scent the air.
One thing in all the world is hard to find:
The cool breeze of the Luo River brushing the face.

**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Zhang Jingzhi’s Gift of Three Study Treasures**

Three treasures of the study, all refined,
Yet in thanks, I fret no fine lines come.
I wish to praise this age of peace in song,
But alas, my talent does not match its splendor.

**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi’s Poem Thanking the Wealthy Minister**

Having seen much favor and disgrace, what is there to fear?
Leaving the dust behind, I rejoice in my own clarity.
In leisure, the qi of heaven and earth is vast,
In stillness, the light of time and space is pure.
My plain deeds and great plans leave no shame,
My full merit in heaven and earth is not in vain.
How fortunate this rustic, to meet such prosperous times—
A hundred years and more, the world at peace.

**Reed and Willow Chant Before the Peaceful Nest**

Before the Peaceful Nest, a small river bends,
New reeds and slender willows, green year after year.
Before my eyes, the light of time is good enough—
Who says life is ever lacking?

**Jar-Window Chant**

A broken jar, gladly discarded,
Yet when gathered, it serves a purpose.
When used, it must be fitted to the mouth,
When placed, it can hold a bed.
No need for carved windows or grand halls,
It can turn back the light of sun and moon.
Lying beneath it in peace,
One may compare to the sages of old.

**Two Sorrows of Life**

Life is ever burdened by two sorrows,
Sorrow in death, sorrow in living—hard to escape.
Some exhaust their strength chasing profit,
Others wear their hearts out seeking fame.
Many fear they will grasp it too late,
Yet before old age, their hair turns white.
What merit have I to stand above them?
Amidst it all, I alone raise my arms, free of care.

**Self-Portrait**

In all the world, none like me,
Ignorant, with no great skill.
In years and looks, like Li Wenshuang,
In bearing, like He Zhizhang.
Often sitting still, drinking tea,
Sometimes strolling, clad in Daoist robes.

Do not mock another’s path,
For peace and joy are my homeland.

**Mid-Autumn Moon**
Once a year comes Mid-Autumn night,
Nine times out of ten the sky is overcast.
To seek fullness, wait for midnight’s hour;
For brightness, watch until the moon stands high.
Where clouds part, the heart’s depth is revealed;
Sleepless, gazing, the mind grows ever keener.
We praise the ancients’ fine poetic lines,
Yet how can they match sharing this night across a thousand miles?

**Song of the Small Cart**
Spring warmth and autumn cool, the seasons fair,
Years of plenty, health unbroken, times serene.
Over grass soft as a mat, it rolls with ease,
Through blossoms bright as brocade, it moves at leisure.

**A Dream of Home**
In dreams I reached my native land,
A land unseen for twenty years.
Dimly, a new realm came in sight,
Vaguely, old mountains and rivers appeared.
My body lay beyond mist and clouds,
My home stood by the roadside.
Awake, the vision lingered still,
A fleeting moment—all was desolate.

**Evening Stroll by the Luo River Sands**
An evening stroll by the Luo River sands,
Countless stones upon the shore.
Green and yellow, long and short,
Large and small, square and round.
Though they number beyond reckoning,
Their true use is hard to find.
Where lies the fabled *langgan* jade?
Only sighs remain.

**Five Poems in Early Autumn, Harmonizing with Li Wenshi**

**I**
A single rain washes the palace eaves,
The Three Rivers’ scene grows clear.
Forest winds carry the breath of *hao*,
Leaves of trees send forth the sound of *shang*.
Suddenly, lotus buds appear;
Soon, chrysanthemums will bloom.
In these peaceful times, I grow old—
How can I repay this life of ease?

**II**
A narrow path, freshly rinsed by rain,
A secluded courtyard, thick with moss.
Before the wind, a mind at leisure,
Beneath the steps, quiet pacing.
I do not resign to aging bones,
Nor yield to the press of fleeting years.
From time to time, I rest on fragrant grass,
Grateful for wine to share with friends.

**III**
The autumn of Wang Jin has arrived,
The scorching sun’s glow begins to fade.
Can one nurture the *zhi* like Mengzi?
In quiet dwelling, will I yield to Pan?
Between bamboo, wind rustles leaf by leaf,
Through pine crevices, the moon glows round.
The Luo She abounds with worthy friends—
With each, joy may be shared.

**IV**
By the pool, trailing willows sway,
By the rail, late flowers smile.
Faded lotus droops its tattered canopy,
Ancient cypress reveals its gnarled branches.
As the year wanes, I marvel at time’s ways,
In old age, I cherish the splendor of things.
The winds of Dongling have not ceased—
I recall the melons of my homeland.

**V**
The sun’s rays fade in thinning clouds,
The treetops’ leaves turn slowly gold.
How can one bear the changing hues?
Through to the end, frost will encroach.
Wine no longer brings intoxication,
The wind easily brings chill.
In old age, what does one desire?
Only peace and well-being, nothing more.

**What Does Yaofu Possess?**
What does Yaofu possess?
A single hue, in harmony with Heaven.
In summer, he dwells in the Cave of Longevity,
In winter, resides in the Nest of Peace.
Orioles and blossoms offer carefree delight,
Wind and moonlight aid his recitations.
I surmise that among human joys,
None surpass my own abundance.

**Longing for the Days When I First Learned to Speak**
Long have I recalled those fleeting words,
When at dawn I played before my parents.
Just learning to walk, I knelt at their knees;
Now aged, my temples are streaked with silver.
Once, at four or five years old,
Now, sixty years have passed.
Yet I still delight in my children’s play—
Joy and tears mingle together.

**In Reply to a Friend**
What is called a good place to dwell?
Not in strength or literary skill.
To act or rest lies within oneself,
Right or wrong is struck by others.
Counting the gains of sages past,
Surveying worldly affairs, truth is required.
Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame arise from action,
Resolute, steadfast, and reticent—these approach *ren*.
Change places, and all remains the same—why quarrel?
Silent yet trusted, no need for lengthy explanation.
Though dwelling among barbarians, one may still walk the Way,
No fear in one’s village, though bonds may not be close.

**Sitting Alone, Reciting**
Heaven’s decree is clear and insistent,
Yet many refuse to heed.
The four seasons each have their scenes,
The myriad things all bear feeling.
Fortune and misfortune are matters before our eyes,
Right and wrong are names left behind.
Who would waste their *qi* on idle strife,
Vainly contending with the world?

**Again**
Heaven’s intent is plain to see,
Yet many refuse to follow.
Orioles and blossoms, spring’s sudden warmth,
Wind and moonlight, rain’s first clearing.
Sitting in stillness, thoughts grow clear,
Reciting at leisure, the heart finds joy.
Who would waste their *qi* on idle strife,
Vainly contending with the world?

**Thoughts Not Yet Arisen in the Heart**
Thoughts not yet arisen in the heart,
Words not yet spoken from the mouth.
No spirit may peer within,
No person may find fault.
The noble one values vigilance in solitude,
Above, unashamed before the rafters’ hidden gaze.
Both gods and men reside in my heart—
The mouth must follow in their wake.

**Reciting in Self-Delight**
Within the city of Jiaoru,
Beneath the Phoenix Tower;
In courtyards of wind and moonlight,
On terraces of orioles and blossoms.
Times of harmony, years of plenty,
Strolling in leisure, sitting in stillness;
Friends well, body at ease,
Refined recitations, elegant discourse.

**Song of the Old Man**
A hoary old man,
Weary of all things.
Old objects, half-forgotten,
Old friends, rarely met.
Hidden flowers linger in mist,
Broken dreams scatter with the wind.
I only wish for the world—
Times of peace, years of plenty.

**Song of the Iron Ruyi**
This object is wrought of iron,
Never held in vain.
Ever beside the great *□* master,
Forever with the small cart’s child.
Striking, it shatters coral,
Tapping, it chips teeth.
Who would learn from such a lot?
Only to enter the lash’s reach.

**Reciting on Daoist Robes**
Daoist ritual employs this robe and kerchief,
Bowing only to stars, not to men.
Why must Yaofu bow?
How can one know men are not stars?

Daoist ritual employs this kerchief and robe,
Beyond the master, whom else would I bow to?
Why must Yaofu bow?
How can one know men are not my teachers?

In the attire of a Daoist—loose robes, dust whisk, and cap—
Casual visits among neighbors are the norm.
I hear that grotto heavens are much the same—
My homeland is no different from the immortals’ realm.

If the Dao resides only in the heart,
The work of creation may be sought within.
If one claims robes and kerchiefs make the Dao,
How dare Yaofu don such garments?

**Reciting on Four Matters**
Eyes, only when the time is right, then see;
Ears, only when the time is right, then hear;
Mouth, only when the time is right, then speak;
Body, only when the time is right, then act.
Ahead, no rich emoluments,
Behind, no mighty armies.
Only where *yi* resides—
What care for profit or fame?

**Reciting on a Chance Thought**
In my prime, I toiled and raced,
Accepting office as my lot.
What I gained was but a pittance,
What I lost was beyond measure.
Today passes like a morning,
Tomorrow slips by like an evening.
Inevitably, like a traveler on the road,
I am worn down by toil and labor.

**Reciting on Four Matters**
There are four gatherings one should not attend,
There are four times one should not venture forth.
Neither noble nor base,
Neither fixed nor certain.
Public assemblies, life celebrations, grand feasts, drinking parties—
Bitter cold, scorching heat, fierce winds, torrential rain.
In the village lanes, leisurely visits,
Body at ease, heart naturally content.
Thus for thirty years,
Fortunate to live in days of peace.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Volume Thirteen concludes
*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Volume Fourteen

**Shào Yōng of Yīchuān (Yáofū)**

**Occasional Writing**
Fine food—do not let it sate,
For sated, one cannot receive more.
Good people—do not let them tire,
For tired, they cannot endure long.
A lowly official bows, and others rejoice;
A high official bows, and others feel shame.
Official rank comes from without—
Why should the heart be thus?

Talent high yet fate meager,
Shame to dwell beneath others.
If not steadfast in poverty,
One does not know the Dao.

The virtuous and powerful,
Wherever they dwell,
Are like orchids and irises,
Inspiring love and admiration.
The wicked and cruel,
Wherever they dwell,
Are like tigers and wolves,
Inspiring fear and dread.

A wife too strong brings misfortune to her husband,
A servant too strong brings misfortune to his master,
A minister too strong brings misfortune to his lord.
A tail larger than the body,
Ice harder than frost—
If not discerned early,
The state falls, the family perishes.

**In Gratitude for the Gift of a Golden Sparrow Inkstone from Advisor Wáng Shèngzhī**

I have often heard of the Bronze Sparrow,
But never of the Golden Sparrow.
At first, I felt shame before the recluses,
For my knowledge of things was not vast.
From whence does the Golden Sparrow emerge?
It must come from the sacred peaks.
Severing the roots of white clouds,
Splitting the corners of green cliffs.
Once carved into a mighty inkstone,
It ascends to the imperial archives.
Water stored within reveals its warmth and luster,
Ink applied shows its depth and flow.
By the window, I delight as its mirror-like surface gleams;
Before my desk, I marvel as the moon seems to descend.
Such a generous gift—how can I repay?
I must offer uncut jade in return.
Why not keep it awhile?
For the great transformation requires measured use.
Why not keep it awhile?
For the worthy are chosen and promoted.
Why not keep it awhile?
For the treacherous are punished and diminished.
Why should it not be kept?
For the people’s sake, to bring them peace.
Then what am I?
I can only receive this gift with astonishment.
I must wield a brush as large as a rafter,
To avoid deep shame.

**Again, Using the Warm Air of a Sunny Window to Appreciate the Spring of Ink Blossoms—Thanking Advisor Wáng Shèngzhī for the Golden Sparrow Inkstone**

An inkstone named Golden Sparrow—unmatched in the world,
In repayment, I am shamed to lack treasures of the realm.
Yet the state’s scholar has poetry of refined elegance,
Where the warm air of a sunny window nurtures the spring of ink blossoms.

**Inscription on the Portrait of Fàn, the Loyal and Illustrious Duke**
Fàn and Shào dwelled in Luòyáng,
Híyí dwelled on Huà Mountain.
Chén and Shào were recluses,
While the Loyal and Illustrious Duke was a prominent official.
Shào came after Fàn,
Chén came before Fàn.
Three men bore similar appearances,
Two shared connected names.

**Reciting on Observing Things**
Time brings alternation,
Things wither and flourish.
People decline and prosper,
Affairs rise and fall.

**Reciting on Flowers**
Fine wine—could it not detain a guest to drink?
Beautiful flowers still know to bloom toward people.
Too tender-hearted to resist the flowers’ intent,
How can one leave the full cup before growing drunk?

**Reciting on Rightness and Profit**
Intent is not as good as rightness,
Rightness is not as good as profit.
Profit moves people,
Making them forget life and death.
Profit is not as good as rightness,
Rightness is not as good as intent.
Intent moves people,
Making them stir heaven and earth.

**Responding to Zhū Diànzhí’s Gift of a Long Rhyming Poem**
Your earnest gift in long verse,
Our village visits span many years.
The year’s affairs come full circle,
Spring’s blossoms follow in radiant succession.

**Trying the Brush**
The heart within the human frame is called the sun,
Able to cast its radiance upon affairs.
How is it that the bright sun illumines all eight directions,
Yet seems confined to the lofty terrace of the mind?
At home, peace and well-being—poverty is no harm;
Without illness, what does thinness matter?
In Luòchéng, I laugh and chant loudly,
Watching the world’s hands and feet scurry in haste.

**Trying the Inkstone**
Wealth and nobility may breed arrogance—few believe it,
Yet do they know how wealth and nobility depart?
Often, in quietude, time passes well,
But I fear idleness brings excessive thought.
The sun rises, and the sky is not dark;
When wind comes, how can water remain still?
In the world, there is much level ground—
Why must one take the shortcut?

**Asking About Seasoning the Cauldron**
I ask you about seasoning the cauldron—
Dare I inquire into the art of its craft?
Only salt and plum are hard to perfect,
But are there not ginger and cinnamon to add spice?
To blend the broth, one must seek beauty,
Yet how can the many mouths all be satisfied?
Beware of speaking lightly of the world’s affairs—
Yī and Zhōu were no ordinary men.

**Reading Ancient Poetry**
Leisurely reading the poems of the ancients,
I ponder their intent.
Though ancient and modern times differ,
Their intent remains unchanged.
Joy and anger, sorrow and delight,
Poverty and wealth, high and low—
Alas, what is this thing called emotion,
That moves people so?

**Bookworm**
Its form resembles a fish,
Its heart delights in gnawing books.
It dwells always in boxes and baskets,
Never in rivers or lakes.
It causes a thousand kinds of harm,
Yet no one speaks of cooking it.
Year after year, when summer peaks,
It molts and is renewed as before.

**Reciting in a Lean Year**
A lean year—my heart is not lean,
A poor household—my Dao is not poor.
Who knows that within heaven and earth,
There exists another fine universe?

**Ultimate Discourse**
Below lies the Yellow Springs, above the heavens,
Each person is granted a hundred years or so.
Yet knowing how many deaths are lived in vain,
It is as if one were never born at all.
To recognize a bright pearl, one must seek the vast sea;
To find fine jade, one must search the famous mountains.
First, one must exhaust all worldly affairs,
Then may one speak of transcending the world.

**Reciting on Seeking a Mirror**
A person without a mirror in flowing water
Should seek a mirror in still water.
Flowing water has no fixed form,
Still water has a fixed essence.
A person without a mirror in water
Should seek a mirror in others.
Water reflects a person’s appearance,
Others reflect a person’s spirit.

**Reciting on Studying Buddhism**
Fine food and rich robes are not easily endured,
Long days and seasons—what can one do with sorrow?
In youth, seeking fame, I turned to Confucius;
In old age, fearing death, I drew near to Śākyamuni.
Futile to sever ties—ties grow heavier;
Vain to seek relief from illness—illness multiplies.
The long river, a strip of silk in the distance,
Fortunately windless—yet waves arise.

**Reciting on Frost and Dew**
Heaven and earth possess moisture,
Which descends in abundance.

**On Frost and Dew (continued)**
Warm, it becomes heavy dew;
Cold, it becomes thick frost.
As dew, the myriad things rejoice;
As frost, the myriad things are harmed.
These two arise from the selfsame qi—
How manifest are grace and might!

**Reciting on Heaven’s Mandate**
What may be entrusted is fate;
What may be relied upon is Heaven.
Man acts not rashly—
Events do not arise by chance.

**On Nature and Disposition**
To cultivate form refines nature;
To follow traces refines disposition.
The worthy follow traces;
The sage embodies form.

**Reciting on Heart and Traces**
The sage comprehends the heart;
The worthy comprehends the traces.
Comprehending the heart knows no bounds;
Comprehending the traces knows no limit.

**Reciting on Observing Things**
No thing flourishes in twain;
No affair proceeds alone.
Glory and decay arise in turn;
Worthy and foolish advance together.

**Reciting on Thought and Care**
Before thought and care arise,
Even spirits and gods cannot know.
If not from me,
Then from whom else?

**In Reply to an Old Friend in Court**
In youth I cultivated literature,
And once beheld the splendor of the state.
Though I have not returned to mountain forests,
I have never forgotten the furrowed fields.
Does the deer in the granary lack ambition?
The phoenix and wild goose follow their own way.
Knowing affairs of today,
Great matters demand reflection.

**Reciting on Not Venturing Out in Winter**
Winter is not that I do not wish to go out—
Wishing to go out, I suffer the shortness of days.
Old in years, I fear long conversations;
In the cold, I dread returning late.
The mountain elder’s head is troubled by wind;
The affection of village friends runs deep.
If you must invite me,
Spring’s light is not far off.

**Observing Things**
Earth, through stillness, is square;
Heaven, through motion, is round.
Having rectified the forms of square and round,
One then discerns the power of motion and stillness.
Stillness prolonged must yield moisture;
Motion at its extreme thus ignites.
Moisture completes the water’s body;
Ignition fulfills fire’s function.
Water’s body is received by vessels;
Fire’s function is transmitted by fuel.
The body comes after Heaven and Earth;
The function arises before Heaven and Earth.

**Reciting on Family and State**
Depravity and uprightness differ in heart,
Yet family and state share the same body.
Depravity brings ruin;
Uprightness brings rise.

**Reciting on Depravity and Uprightness**
The worthy delight in uprightness;
The treacherous delight in depravity.
Delighting in depravity breeds contention;
Delighting in uprightness fosters harmony.

**Reciting on Righteousness and Profit**
The noble person esteems righteousness;
The petty person esteems profit.
Esteeming profit brings chaos;
Esteeming righteousness brings order.

**Reciting on Heaven’s Timing**
Man acts in affairs;
Heaven’s mandate is timing.
Timing, once lost, is hard to recover;
Affairs, once gone, are difficult to pursue.

**Reciting on Grace and Righteousness**
Deep grace makes one kin;
Weighty righteousness makes one lord.
When both grace and righteousness are attained,
Only then is one called human.

**Reciting on Leisurely Strolls**
What is called a true friend?
A true friend is not lightly found.
Without the ears of Music-Master Kuang,
How can there be the zither of Bo Ya?
Though the mulberry and elm cast their shadows,
How could I forget the heart of pine and cassia?
Walking alone on the moonlit embankment,
Each step is met with a lofty chant.

**Reciting at One’s Side**
The myriad transformations are complete within the body—
One must but nurture them deeply.
Why is it called a precious mirror?
Only because it is wrought of refined gold.
Wine, when scarce, is sipped like tea;
Poetry, when abundant, is chanted like history.
Yan Yuan found joy within the world’s bounds—
The world’s affairs are hard to bear.

**Reciting on Snow**
Fine wine and choice dishes with pipes and strings,
All night the cauldron boils in celebration of a bountiful year.
Deep within the lord’s gates, do they know?
A million displaced people lie beneath the open sky.

**Self-Composed on the New Year of My Sixty-Fifth Year, Xining 8**
My home lies within Luoyang’s walls,
Moreover by the banks of the Tianjin.
In my sixty-fifth year,
Amid the Song’s flourishing dawn.
The southern garden borders the thoroughfare;
The northern garden gazes upon twin towers.
Though dwelling in the capital,
It is as if I reside in a mountain stream.
Clear springs trace the channels;
Lush trees adorn the skies.
Cool winds descend through bamboo;
Bright moon appears amid pines.
Before me grow orchids and angelica;
Beneath my gaze, no ice nor embers.
At my seat, joy abounds;
In my breast, no strife.
Winter and summer, I do not venture out—
Heat and cold change in vain.
Glory and disgrace do not enter—
Wealth and honor parade in vain.
I loathe hearing of others’ faults;
I delight in speaking of others’ goodness.
Why hesitate to act?
Why take medicine when not dizzy?
Who says gold and stone are hard?
Their hearts, too, can break.
Who says spirits and gods are divine?
Their sincerity, too, can pierce through.

**Six-Word Reciting on a Small Carriage**
In days past, riding a carriage was common;
Now, seeing one ride, they rush in haste.
Since there are warnings from carriages past,
How can there be no caution in treading their tracks?
Before setting out, one must drink tea;
Before ascending, one must don traveling attire.
At the axle’s side, hang volumes of poetry;
By the shaft’s end, suspend a jar of wine.
The wheels turn slowly to pass fragrant grasses;
The canopy lowers to avoid drooping willows.
By the water’s edge, one must proceed with care;
Amid flowers, one must move with composure.
At dawn, one often traverses the path of shoes;
At dusk, one frequently passes the lane of peace.
In deep spring, one gazes upon radiant beauty;
In late autumn, one feasts sight on abundant harvests.
Before the Tower of Five Phoenixes, the moon’s glow;
Atop the Tianjin Bridge, the cool breeze.
In the Golden Valley Garden, flowing waters;
Beyond the Wei King’s Embankment, tall bamboos.
In stillness, time is most precious;
In leisure, the flavor lingers long.
All one passes is met with delight;
All one sees is free from attachment.
One may see farmers grasping their plows;
One may see silkworm maidens seeking mulberry.
One may see *miwu* covering the fields;
One may see caltrops filling the walls.
One may see thorns growing dense;
One may see orchids and angelica fragrant.
One may see chickens, pigs, and dogs at labor;
One may see eagles, ospreys, and phoenixes in flight.
The harmful are not seen to cause harm;
The good are surely not harmed.
The three peaks of Mount Hua stand towering;
The myriad acres of the Yellow Pool stretch vast.
If not to live as a man in vain,
Then do not squander leisure in Luoyang.
Having gained much of Heaven and Earth’s essence,
What harm if Old Man Yaofu departs?

**Reciting on Peace and Joy**
The Master of Peace and Joy,
Without fame or surname,
For thirty years has dwelt
By the Luo in Luoyang.
His heart holds the wind and moon;
His nature, rivers and lakes.
He takes flight at the sight of color,
Alighting only after soaring.
No lowly, no poor;
No rich, no noble.
No sending off, no welcoming;
No restraint, no taboo.
Never troubled by hardship;
Never drinking to drunkenness.
He gathers the world’s spring
Into his liver and lungs.
His pool nurtures his chants;
His jar-window invites sleep.
The small carriage delights his heart;
The great brush quickens his will.
Sometimes he dons a bamboo hat;
Sometimes he wears a half-sleeve.
Sometimes he sits amid the woods;
Sometimes he walks by the water’s edge.
He delights in seeing good people;
He delights in hearing good deeds.
He delights in speaking good words;
He delights in acting with good intent.
Hearing of others’ faults,
It is as if he bears thorns.

Hearing of others’ goodness,
It is as if he wears orchids and thoroughwort.

He neither flatters Chan masters
Nor flatters masters of esoteric arts.
Without stepping beyond his gate,
He directly reaches heaven and earth.
No army can overawe him;
No wealth of ten thousand bushels can entice him.
A joyful man of sixty-five years—
His jar-window invites his chants.

**Chant by the Jar-Window**

A guest knows nothing,
Only knowing to guard himself.
In guarding himself, there is nothing else—
Only seeking to avoid fault.
He has a few rooms,
A few acres of fields.
He uses a basin as his pool,
A jar as his window.
Walls higher than his shoulders,
A room larger than a peck measure.
A cloth quilt warms him beyond need,
A bowl of millet gruel fills him past hunger.
The qi he exhales from his chest
Fills the cosmos.
His brush falls upon the world,
Its radiance outshining jade and gem.
If one knows contentment,
Retreat becomes flourishing;
I never go out—
What retreat could there be?

His heart harbors no reckless thoughts,
His feet take no reckless steps.
He makes no reckless friendships,
Accepts no reckless things.
Fiercely debated,
He sweetly endures his humble state.
Loftily spoken,
None surpasses him.
The books of the sages never leave his hand;
The words of Yao and Shun never leave his lips.
Amidst harmony and heaven,
He delights in easy friendships.
He chants poems at ease,
Drinks joyful wine.
A hundred years of peace—
Is this not fortune?
Seventy years of health—
Is this not longevity?

**Chant by the Basin Pool**

A guest knows nothing,
Only knowing not to act.
In not acting, there is nothing else—
Only seeking not to deceive.
I have what others affirm;
Others have no fault of mine.
Thus he opens his jar-window,
And so he digs his basin pool.
Urban land is precious,
But rivers and lakes hold wondrous scenes.
Able to wander marshlands,
He need not step from his hall’s foundation.
Green grass beyond the curtain,
Yellow banks before the pavilion.
The moon sets within his pot,
Clouds fly within his mirror.
Since there are lotus and water-chestnuts,
How could there be no reeds?
Since there are tadpoles,
How could there be no dragons?
Sometimes clear and shallow,
Sometimes vast and boundless.
Sometimes limpid and pure,
Sometimes rippling with waves.
Wind stirs the duckweed,
Coolness rises in his sleeves.
Where is Lin Zong?
Where has Fan Li returned?
Dense snow falls softly,
Light ice spreads thinly.
Willows droop gently,
Fine rain drifts faintly.
Here one may find perfection,
Here one may forget schemes.
Here one may reflect things,
Here one may observe the seasons.
If not joyful in myself,
Who else could bring me joy?
On this day,
I meet Fuxi once more.

**Chant of the Small Carriage**

A guest knows nothing,
Only knowing he has a home.
With a home to return to,
His return is not distant.
His spirit terrace gleams with stillness,
Heaven and earth bloom with flowers.
He writes with a great brush,
Rides in a small carriage.
Born a man
In the Central Kingdom,
And dwelling in Luoyang—
What greater fortune could there be?
At the center of heaven and earth,
The true abode of emperors.
The legacy of Han and Tang,
Its grandeur naturally fine.
A realm of sages and worthies,
A deep pool of scholars.
A field of benevolence and righteousness,
Boundless in what one hears and sees.
Neighborhoods press close,
Friends and kin visit often.
Others suspect the sun’s chariot,
I say it is the stars’ array.
Sometimes he roams Golden Valley,
Sometimes he drifts on Moonlit Waves.
Sometimes he treads the Path of Shoes,
Sometimes he passes Bronze Camels.
Advancing and retreating like clouds and water,
Unfurling and rolling like mist and rosy clouds.
He extols the wind and moon,
Lifts and adorns orioles and flowers.
By nature he delights in wine,
Delights in a slight flush from drinking.
Before the flush comes,
His mouth already chants.
When chanting is not enough,
He breaks into a vast song.
When vast song is not enough—
There is nothing to be done.

**Chant of the Great Brush**

A guest knows nothing,
His nature too unadorned.
He neither envies nor seeks,
Neither clings nor insists.
His feet tread the root of heaven,
His hands probe the moon’s cave.
What his heart gains,
He pours entirely into his brush.
Thoughts distant, emotions fused,
Qi harmonious, spirit at ease.
Wine loosens him to a slight glow,
Silk spreads half a bolt.
Swift as the wind’s sudden gust,
Burgeoning as the clouds’ surge.
Fleeting as lightning’s flash,
Dense as the rain’s fall.
Now halting, now returning,
Now vanishing, now appearing.
It scours away dust and haze,
Clears the sky and reveals the sun.
Phoenixes soar,
Dragons and serpents coil.
Spring blossoms glow bright,
Autumn mountains stand towering.
Three thousand scholars in caps and robes
Bow to follow the Confucian way.
A million warriors in armor
Look up to heed military discipline.
Pines and cassia form a forest,
Orchids and irises fill the room.
Sichuan brocade unfurls,
Dawn’s rosy clouds brush past.
A pair of white jades,
A hundred measures of gold.
Wang Xizhi comes to seek,
Du Mu comes to beg.
Spiritual communion beyond the world,
Worldly affairs come to an end.
Observers are startled awake,
Those who collect it recover faster.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Fourteen*
*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Fifteen*
*Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu*
*Observing the Changes, a Chant*

**A Chant on Observing the One**

A single thing comes with a single body,
Within that body lies another heaven and earth.
If you know all things are complete within me,
How could you set the Three Powers apart to root them?
Heaven from its center divides substance and function—
Or one might say, the workings of creation.
Humans weave their plans within the heart.
Heaven and humanity—how could there be two meanings?
Or one might say, all affairs.
The Dao does not move in vain; it rests in humanity.

---

**A Chant on Observing History**

Alas! The power of four dynasties’ kings
All enters this humble, ancient volume.
Some yielded, some contested—thirty thousand li,
Linked and transformed across two thousand years.
Who could continue the deeds of Tang and Yu?
The arts of Tang and Wu are lost to the world.
Times differ, and so do people—
How could Confucius not weep in sorrow?

---

**A Chant on Observing the *Book of Poetry***

To love one’s lord as in those days is rare,
Yet nothing captures human feeling like poetry.
Without the *Ya*, how could royal teachings be clear?
Only with the *Feng* can a state’s rise and fall be known.
No connoisseur compares to the Lord of Wu,
And even Confucius once polished its lines.
Three hundred and five poems—all the world’s affairs—
Who among later men would dare to criticize?

---

**Observing the *Spring and Autumn Annals***

The august royal house exists in name alone,
War never ceases beneath heaven.
States are destroyed, men are conquered—none lags behind,
Seeking alliances, exacting vengeance—never at peace.
The decrees of Jin and Qi burn like fire,
While the foundations of Wen and Wu chill like ice.
Only the sorrow for the unicorn remains a single heart,
Preserved for ten thousand years as if in cinnabar.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Three Sovereigns**

How vast the cosmos—it proclaims itself through me,
Beyond heaven and earth, what more is there to say?
At first, the Great Dao was no ordinary Way,
Just as there was a time before and after heaven.
Its methods were so subtle, no trace could be seen,
Its achievements so enduring, the years were unknown.
If the world were to rank meritorious deeds,
None could stand before them.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Five Emperors**

Willing to yield or advance the realm,
What words could describe their grace?
Where their robes hung, majesty flourished,
When jade and silk were offered, reverence shone.
Every thing followed the highest principle,
Each person willingly achieved great deeds.
How did they attain this?
Only by their brilliance, like the sun at noon.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Three Kings**

A vast expanse of the Central Plains—over ten thousand *li*—
Hardly a place for the weak to dwell.
Xia and Shang could still proclaim their calendars,
Yet Tang and Wu could not easily wield their weapons.
The Fire of Ze received its name and thus transformed,
But the Water of Heaven found no response—no need arose.
Those who take benevolence and righteousness as their heart
Would never become petty men of the world.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Five Hegemons**

Intent on honoring their names, their names suffered more,
As people rushed to obey, exhausted beyond endurance.
Lives were lived amid forests of swords and spears,
While justice and wealth were carried in their hearts.
Though they could sigh for the lamb and cherish ritual,
Alas, the phoenix never came to grace them.
Within the remaining years of Eastern Zhou’s Five Hegemons,
Only Confucius was heard to sigh.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Seven States**

At their end, they still schemed and maneuvered,
Deaf to words of benevolence and righteousness.
Who would have thought Qi could be broken yet Jimo preserved?
Or that victory at Changping meant burying Zhao’s men alive?
Seeing ghosts at dawn was no strange thing,
Killing in broad daylight caused no surprise.
Then came Su and Zhang, wielding their three-inch tongues,
Grasping throats so none could live together.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Qin Dynasty**

The seven states clashed with thunderous might,
Grinding against one another, never at rest.
Only when one lord’s heart was set
Did the four seas run red with blood.
Three thousand retainers soon became a dream,
A hundred and two mountains and rivers turned to autumn.
Boasting of enfeoffing marquises to guard the land—
Yet Zhao Gao was no marquis at all.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Two Han Dynasties**

The old battlegrounds of Qin’s broken mountains and rivers—
Who would have thought the people would farm mulberries again?
Nine thousand *li* of land opened to enfeoffment,
Over four hundred years bearing the title of emperor.
After ruin came Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo,
Yet none remembered the efforts of Gao and Guang.
With such splendor of culture in those days,
How could the city walls ever lie in ruins again?

---

**A Chant on Observing the Three Kingdoms**

Awe-inspiring, the tripod’s stand shook like thunder,
Yet its lofty traces are lost to time.
Drums and flutes in one region left emotions unfulfilled,
Bows and blades across ten thousand *li* strained their strength.
Debating war with Hengshi—was there no intent?
Watering horses at the Yellow River—was it all in vain?
Though one may speak of heaven’s timing, it is also human affairs—
Who could have known that beyond foresight, fine gold would be lost?

---

**A Chant on Observing the Western Jin**

Peace does not mean there is no worry,
To be at ease and forget danger is no good plan.
Ranking men’s talents relied on biting satire,
Judging the times required a taste for elegance.
A knife could not cut open the belly of Gonglü,
No wood could behead Liu Yuan.
The disaster lay in a single line at Evening Sun Pavilion,
While at the Eastern Gate, the waves sighed endlessly.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Sixteen Kingdoms**

Beneath the vast sky, the realm was called the imperial domain,
Where Great Yu once governed the aftermath of floods.
When clothes wore out, lice and nits multiplied,
When melons rotted, worms and maggots thrived.
Dragon robes were never meant for mad bandits,
Nor were the standards of court ever raised for rebellious Hu.
Confucius had words worth pondering—
In those days, they lacked a Guan Yiwu.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Northern and Southern Dynasties**

When the world was split between north and south,
Envoys never ceased their journeys.
Partial hegemons still upheld ancient laws,
A fragile peace bore traces of old stench.
Luoyang’s refined reputation praised Cui Hao,
The south’s extraordinary talent admired Xie An.
For two hundred and forty years, they rode side by side—
How could one casually call them barbarians?

---

**A Chant on Observing the Sui Dynasty**

From the start, the plans were flawed,
And those who followed only compounded the harm.
People were as insignificant as ants, coveting land,
Gold and silk as worthless as mud, pleasing concubines.
The campaign against Liaodong aimed for the wild frontiers,
The canal’s flow expressed weariness with the endless.
Thirty-six years—all swept away.
Had it not been so, the world would not have returned to Tang.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Tang Dynasty**

Heaven-born, divine, and martial, it settled the center,
For without it, the many rebels would not have been quelled.
Without the stern winds of the Zhenguan era,
How could the Kaiyuan age have known such glory?
Only from on high could the grandeur of mountains and rivers be seen,
Only in summer could the length of days and months be known.
For three hundred years, it unified the realm—
Though the deeds are past, the Dao shines ever brighter.

---

**A Chant on Observing the Five Dynasties**

Since the Tang’s fall and the collapse of imperial order,
The world’s people have suffered turmoil.
The altars of state hung on the whims of soldiers,
The court’s weight was decided by the clamor of regional lords.
Deep winter’s cold trees do not shed their leaves,
The faint stars before dawn still hold their light.

**A Chant on Observing the Five Dynasties (continued)**

Fifty-three years passed under five successive houses—
Only then did we know the land awaited a true king.

**A Chant on Witnessing Prosperity**

Amid the chaos of the Five Dynasties’ upheaval,
Suddenly the clouds parted, and heaven reappeared.
Grass and trees, bathed in fresh rain and dew for a hundred years,
Wheels and writs now traverse the old mountains and rivers for ten thousand *li*.
In ordinary lanes and alleys, officials still don their caps and sashes,
While gardens and pavilions, one after another, resound with pipes and strings.
Though the people grow old in this age of peace, spring remains young—
Orioles and blossoms do no harm, even as the sun climbs high and men sleep on.
We, who cultivate simplicity, rely on this enlightened age,
Fortunate beyond measure—how could we not know?
The realm’s finest talents now retreat into obscurity,
While in this world of fair scenes, brows unfurrow in delight.
Born only to know abundance,
Aged without ever enduring chaos or separation.
Five deeds surpass all previous dynasties—
Even under Yao, none could match them:
First: On the day of revolution, the markets did not alter their stalls;
Second: The conquest of the realm was achieved after ascending the throne;
Third: Not a single innocent life was taken;
Fourth: At a hundred years, only four reigns;
Fifth: A century without internal strife.

**A Chant on Rejoicing in Old Age**

How long can these silken temples last?
Why trouble with plucking each white hair?
Though I hold no office in this world,
I know well the affairs of men.
When spring warms and autumn cools,
That is my time to wander east and float west.
How many vast and fertile fields lie open—
Only now does this old mountain-dweller truly smile.

**A Chant on Paying Homage to Confucius**

Who, holding a scroll, does not read?
But how many truly grasp the nature of things?
His craft lies within the world’s speech,
Yet his subtlety transcends the carpenter’s line.
Refining being and non-being—heaven’s work;
Balancing order and chaos—the emperor’s task.
Great indeed is his intent in praising the *Yi* and compiling the Classics—
Surely none among the people since his time have matched it.

**Returning the Poetry Scroll of Beneficent Master Yi**

Monk’s staff and alms bowl have followed me, wrapped in a single cloth,
That cloth once brushed the dust of ten provinces.
His mind, long attuned to Buddha-nature, knows no hindrance,
His speech, though steeped in Confucian words, remains unforced.
The mountains and rivers of Wu and Yue are but yesterday’s affairs,
While the wind and moon of Yi and Song now belong to this body.
Strolling or sitting idly beneath pine shadows,
He must rely on sharp eyes to laugh at the world.

**A Chant on Heaven and Man**

To know all of human nature—how could heaven differ?
Yet not knowing is as distant as heaven from earth.
In youth, the qi is sharp but untried,
Unwilling to believe the world holds hardship.
To know both human nature and heaven’s will—
Speak of them as one, and where is the division?
To extend one’s own heart to others’ hearts,
What worry remains that the realm cannot be governed?

**A Chant on Spring at Brocade Screen Mountain**

Beneath Brocade Screen Mountain lies my home,
Where every year the festival of Cold Food arrives.
Early spring’s weather is already fine—
How much more so with a master so worthy for a hundred *li*?
Together we drink by the same stream,
Drunk, we sleep beneath ten thousand blossoms.
Tomorrow, the saddle turns eastward—
The scenery of Shangyang will be even more radiant.

**A Chant on Delighting in Spring**

Of the four seasons, I love spring best,
And in spring, I love the vernal equinox most.
Warmth gently nurtures all things,
No chill clings to men.
Fine flowers just unfurl their buds,
Exquisite wine is light and mellow.
A guest in this nest of peace and joy—
How could I not grow half-drunk?

**Four Chants on Observing Things**

The sun and moon shine no differently,
Yet day and night, the moon’s form changes.
Men and ghosts share the same emotions,
But life and death follow different principles.
If you cannot know life,
How can you know death?
If you cannot serve men,
How can you serve ghosts?

Orioles and cicadas differ in form—
Why trouble yourself with vain words?
When qi is abundant, strength overflows,
When sound fades, it is no different from silence.
Timing comes by one’s own effort,
Fate departs at another’s will.
Do not grieve over heart-wrenching matters—
Grief brings no benefit to the body.

The passions of past and present are one—
Who finds it hard to endure?
Discerning affairs is no easy task,
Knowing men is even harder.
Excessive doubt undermines trust,
Blind faith loosens vigilance.
Even Yao and Shun had their flaws—
How could they have lacked great villains?

What a man’s ears hear
Cannot compare to what his eyes witness.
Ears hear conflicting accounts,
Eyes see no deception.
To cast aside ears and eyes,
Relying solely on the tongue’s debate—
This may not achieve the world’s work,
But only invite the world’s laughter.

**A Chant on the Value of Spirit**

A man’s worth lies in his spirit,
Yet spirit often lacks purity.
To possess spirit and purity—
That is the first-rank man.
Without purity, there is no principle;
Right and wrong shift with anger and joy.
In anger, right becomes wrong;
In joy, wrong becomes right.
Anger estranges the good,
Joy aligns with the petty.
Few are the ruined states and lost families
Not born of this.

Take a wife for her gentleness,
Marry a husband for his talent and beauty.
How rare the upright woman
Who matches a true man!

**A Chant on Righteousness and Profit**

Nobler than hills and gardens,
Even meager silks are prized.
When righteousness comes first,
Profit follows naturally.
Abandon your sacred tortoise,
To gawk at my chewing jaws.
Having lost righteousness,
What can profit achieve?
To esteem righteousness is to yield—
The gentleman’s Way grows.
To esteem profit is to contend—
The petty man’s Way prevails.

**A Chant on the Small Carriage’s First Outing**

Beyond the world lie thirty-six grotto-heavens,
All seemingly arrayed within Luoyang.
On days when spring warms and autumn cools,
A small carriage can move but one palace a day.

**Composed at the Banquet of Prefect Wang Xuanhui**

The capital’s three-time host, master of the house,
Whose grand estate and famous gardens crown Luoyang.
Again, a new spring falls into his hands—
Ten thousand flowers’ fragrance illuminates the wine cups’ crimson.
Another spring has passed in a flurry,
Leaving only melancholy, drowned in wine’s depth.
All the radiant scenes have faded from view—
Only before the goblet do I recall old friends.

**A Chant in Late Spring, Replying to a Friend**

After a year apart, how do you fare?
Do not say that being neighbors leaves virtue unaccompanied.
Luoyang’s spring has already ended in a span of inches—
Do you still remember our past visits?

**A Chant on Hearing Music at Tianjin Bridge**

Famous gardens stand side by side in Luoyang’s spring,
Lanes and alleys are dust-free, silks and satins renewed.
Where is that green tower beyond the peach and plum?
The strains of music drift again to Tianjin Bridge.

**A Chant on Late Spring**

Willow catkins, full of intent, vainly imitate snow,
Elm pods, heartless, idly pile like coins.
Poverty and sorrow cannot bear spring’s betrayal—
Wine-sickness lingers, little changed from last year.

**Two Self-Inquiries**

Why have I been able to write poetry these past years?
Alas, the years age, and spring returns again.
The wandering oriole cannot bear the flowers’ scattering,
Crying until dusk, it still cries on.

**Why These Years of Poetry?**

Why these years of poetry?
Peach and plum stay silent, but the oriole has words.
It cries until dusk and still cries on—
Alas, the years age, and spring returns again.

**In Response to Commissioner Yu Gongda of Chengdu**

Two years ago, my carriage passed Tianjin,
Where we often raised our cups beneath the flowers.
Now in this brocade city, blossoms blaze—
Yet how could I recall Luoyang’s spring?

**Two Chants on Wu and Yue**

In the *yisi* year, Helü humbled Chu;
In the *wuchen* year, Goujian crushed Wu.
Had they seized the moment as of old,
Thirty-four years would have passed unknown.

Fu Chai, in the *dingwei* year, imprisoned Yue;
Goujian, in the *wuchen* year, destroyed Wu.
Twenty-two years of reversal—
Just as before, they struck at emptiness.

**A Chant on Duty**

The wren finds its nest in a single branch,
Not swayed by sweet words into careless pride.
Even with strength, crossing the North Sea is hard—
How could mere might move a goose feather?
I wish to express my gratitude clearly,
Not to squander favor in reckless haste.
Heaven’s blessings are many, yet fortune fades—
Spring flowers, though lush, still wither too soon.

**A Chant on Rise and Fall**

Sun, Chen, and Li—
Their downfalls were alike.
Though they had some culture,
Where was their heroic spirit?

Cao, Liu, and Sun—
Their rises were alike.
Though they had some talent,
Where was their world-changing destiny?

**A Chant on Civil and Martial Arts**

As a man of letters,
One must also be prepared for war.
The Way of civil and martial arts—
Both are my family’s affairs.

**A Chant on Good and Evil**

Gun had a son,
While Yao and Shun had none.
Why do blessings and calamities follow thus?

Yao and Shun had no heirs,
While Gun had descendants.
Why do fortune favor virtue and disaster strike excess?

**A Chant on Self-Examination**

Not being a perfect man,
I do not demand perfection in others.
But if I were a perfect man,
I would demand perfection in myself.

**A Chant on Well-Being**

Health without illness,
Fortune without disaster—
Even if the whole world enjoyed them,
They would not be enough.

**A Chant on Four Things**

Wealth, beauty, fame, and power—
The world clings to these.
Only when unmoved by the four
Can one truly see others.

**A Chant on Gratitude and Resentment**

In human nature,
Nothing weighs heavier than death.
Gratitude stirs the heart—
Even in death, there is joy.
Resentment binds the heart—
Even in death, it does not end.
So deep are gratitude and resentment,
They shape a person thus.

**Two Chants on Qin Chuan**

Back then, I rode through Qin Chuan,
And in a flash, twenty years have passed.
Hearing you speak of home,
I vaguely recall its old mist and haze.

Qin Chuan, land of Han emperors,
Now the eastern passes hold the capital.
How many sages and worthies fill the old histories—
Yet in the setting sun, only desolation remains.

**In Response to Prefect Wang Zhongxian of Jiang**

As a gentleman of Jiang, you bear the bronze tiger tally,
And your poems are no empty boast.
The land still bears the grasses and trees of Tang,
The mountains and rivers still stir the clouds and mist of Jin.
Your gardens and ponds overflow with verse,
The customs are pure, and lawsuits never reach your hall.
As prefect, you bring blessings to the people—
Your heart never fails the court.

**A Chant on Sun and Moon**

The moon shines, stars grow sparse;
The sun rises, the moon fades.
If there was a Shao Zhengmao,
Could there be no Confucius?

**A Chant on Flood and Drought**

Yao endured nine years of floods,
Tang seven years of drought.
Where now is the skill of their governance?

Nine years of floods,
Seven years of drought—
Had it not been for Yao and Tang,
Half the people would have perished.

**A Chant on Growing Old**

If I could turn back ten years,
I might still accomplish something.
But in this world,
The sun never returns to noon.
Now I am sixty-six,
My decline beyond compare.
My will outstrips my strength—
All know this well.

**A Chant on Human Affairs**

Nothing is harder to refine than affairs,
Nothing harder to know than people.
Human feelings shift with every gesture,
Yet affairs all reach the same end.

**A Chant on Difference**

The seeker does not obtain,
The refuser cannot let go.
How far apart are the two?

**A Chant on Greed and Righteousness**

To covet another’s evil—
No greater fault exists.
To covet another’s good—
This too is a sin.

**A Chant on the New Moon**

The new moon and the waning moon,
Their shapes are much the same.
Yet why does the human heart
Rejoice only at the first sight?

**In Response to Magistrate Li Shifu of Neixiang**

Though not like an immortal,
You escape heat and cold.
How could there be no streams and bamboos?
You never leave the forests and peaks.
The Dao differs from new learning,
Talent alone won’t move high officials.
Yet in times of peace and plenty,
There is still joy to spare.

The year is abundant, the times prosperous,
And your post lies in Nanyang.
Not neglecting the people’s affairs,
You wander among clouds and waters.
Spring offers peach and plum’s radiance,
The wind carries orchid and iris’s fragrance.
The prefect is both wise and capable—
No need for frantic haste.

**Tianchun Pavilion in Neixiang**

Neixiang has a garden called Tianchun,
Where in spring, peach and plum bloom like clouds.
The townsfolk bring wine beneath the canopies,
Singing and dancing in joy.
The magistrate remains at ease,
Claiming no ancient surpassed him.
A hundred kinds of red and purple peonies—
Glorious but fruitless, merely flamboyant.

**Jianyin Pavilion in Neixiang**

Your letter of *Jianyin* surprised me,
And at that moment, it stirred me to rise.

The people are pure, lawsuits rare as in mountain dwellings.
Beyond ledgers and cups, in leisure between official bonds,
Amidst talk and laughter, I know not—
Which neighboring county could compare?

**Li Shaoqing’s Invitation to Visit and Improvise**

The Luoyang spring departs, meeting immortals’ talent,
Spring gone, startled by summer’s sudden arrival.
A light rain passes, peonies just withered,
A gentle breeze stirs, herbaceous peonies newly bloomed.
Within the shade of green willows, cups and jars abound—
In health and prosperous times, how fine to let the heart roam free.

**Chant on Wine-Induced Illness**

Year after year at this time,
Wine-sickness seals the brushwood gate.
Early on, people feel much—
How bear spring’s return?
Flowers fade, butterflies flutter in disarray,
Daylengthens, cuckoos cry.
How might one regain those former days,
When the warm breeze first fanned so gently?

**Chant on Contention and Yielding**

Where yielding exists, can contention be absent?
Without continuity, how could renewal arise?
Contention and yielding arise from the heart,
Continuity and renewal emerge from traces.
Fuxi and Shennong yielded through the Dao,
Yao and Shun yielded through virtue.
Tang and Wu contended through merit,
Huan and Wen contended through force.

**Xie Wang’s Remembrance in Verse**

Before and behind the western study, half pines and bamboos,
Myriad cares settle, only then is truth seen.
Never did I expect that in this bright and limpid sky,
You could still recall old friends and kin.

**Matching Rhymes in Response to Ren Sifeng’s Gift of Verse**

The nobility of kings and marquises defies description,
Yet in paintings of Zhongshan, one glimpse suffices.
Not like my lord, who in sitting and walking,
Greedily admires Songshan, then loves Mount Tiantan more.
A hundred-foot tower pierces the perilous void,
Sky pale, clouds idle—beholding the emperor’s work.
Ascending one more level, the heart still unsatisfied,
Longing for you unseen, I see only towering Song.

Declining the banner, I came here to dwell in cloudy skies,
Hearing you’re well and climbing, how could I dread the toil?
On purple paths, affairs abound yet remain unseen—
My homeland encircled is none other than lofty Song.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Fifteen Concludes*
*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Scroll Sixteen*

**Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu’s Poems in Response**

**In Reply to a Friend’s Poem**
Are my sinews and bones still as they were in years past?
Do my qi and blood remain as they were in days of old?
Yet I rejoice in one thing that has grown with time—
The skill in talk and laughter before the winecup.

**Chant on the Withering Cold**
Pines and cypresses, seen in winter’s grasp,
Alone reveal the year’s withering cold.
Their sound must be heard amid the wind’s embrace,
Their hue best viewed beneath the snow’s mantle.

**Matching Rhymes in Thanks for Ren Sifeng’s Gift of the "Carefree Pillow" Poem**
My lord bestows upon me a carefree pillow,
Fearing my carefree steps have not yet transcended.
Though body may wander carefree, it has not yet arrived—
I must join spirit and dream in carefree flight.

**Chant on Qi and Zheng**
Zichan never shrank from Zheng’s smallness,
Yan Ying never wished Qi’s decline.
Had these two worthies been born in their rightful place,
Their talents would have served as kings’ tutors.

**Poem Sent in Place of a Letter to Lü the Keeper of the Treasury**
The Zhou king’s eight steeds raced to the ends of the earth,
Yet how could they compare to the marvel of your four treasures?
Though Zheng and Luo’s winds and mists lie but a hand’s span away,
I regret I have no way to journey and behold them.

**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi After Rain**
The scorching toil of summer’s nine ten-day spans now past,
A single rain revives all things.
The frogs’ drums are not worth hearing,
The mosquitoes’ thunder not easily driven off.
Not only does it ease the year’s provisions,
But also settles the officials’ dues.
For a wanderer at leisure beneath the trees,
Why not delight in this moment?

**Matching Rhymes in Response to Minister He’s Gift**
I deemed myself unfit for the world’s affairs,
Passing winter and summer behind barred gates.
The path to blue clouds is smooth, yet I rise without merit,
Amid sparse green bamboo, I find my share of leisure.
Still, bright flowers reward my simple aspirations,
And fine wine brings a flush to my cheeks.
Lately, the signs of age weigh heavily upon me—
I fear such gifted talents are not easily matched.

**Chant on Purity and Harmony**
Pure but not harmonious—narrow and full of coarseness.
Harmonious but not pure—indolent and lacking in propriety.
To be both harmonious and pure,
Righteousness has no fixed form.
Move when the time is right to move,
Halt when the time is right to halt.

**Chant on Similarity and Difference**
Brilliance and swiftness risk fragmentation,
Weightiness and gravity risk stagnation.
Pursuits follow what one esteems,
Yet cannot escape similarity or difference.
What differs from oneself must be wrong,
What aligns with oneself must be right.
Right and wrong wage war over similarity and difference,
And one may pass a lifetime without knowing righteousness.

**Chant on the Moment**
In life, one seeks to please others;
In death, one seeks to please the spirits.
Pleasing others may bring wealth and honor,
Pleasing spirits may avert blame and calamity.
Though life and death follow different paths,
Are the principles of men and spirits truly distinct?
Alas, such overuse of the heart—
When will these vain intentions cease?

**Chant on Observing Things**
Ears sharp, eyes bright—a man’s body,
Endowed by the great potter’s hand, not born poor.
Only by delving into the moon’s cavern can one know things,
Without treading the heaven’s root, how can one recognize men?
When Qian meets Xun, observe the moon’s cavern;
Where earth meets thunder, behold the heaven’s root.
Roaming between heaven’s root and the moon’s cavern,
All thirty-six palaces bloom with spring.

The simple and honest lack keen insight,
The keenly insightful lack careful discernment.
How might one find both simplicity and keen insight,
To speak with them of the world’s affairs?

**Chant Over Wine**
With wine, I often raise a cup,
Now nearing seventy, what more do I seek?
Teeth failing, marriages and betrothals not yet settled,
Years of drought, fields yielding but a meager harvest.
Guests depart, and at times I fold my hands in leisure,
The sun high, with nothing to do, I quietly comb my hair.
Frost-touched locks do more than adorn poetic scenes—
They may yet serve as subjects for a painter’s brush.

**Chant on Autumn Thoughts**
A season of spring has barely passed,
When geese from beyond the clouds announce their return.
The turning of seasons comes before my eyes like this,
While the years slip from my head thus.
Though the ambitions of youth remain,
How can these sinews and bones not weaken?
Yet I rely on this inch of heart, ever glad—
Even the sages’ hardest truths I can comprehend.

**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi on an Autumn Outing**
Spring and summer have come and gone, fit for poetry,
Yet though fit for poetry, what use is it?
Often empty like Yanzi,
Yet far from matching Huizi in traversing things.
The mood of wind and moon is beyond bearing,
The sentiment of clouds and mountains cannot be contained.
A song, a chant—let us exchange verses,
Daring to match Anzhi and Jingzhi.

*Zhang Shaoqing Tuan, styled Jingzhi.*

**Matching Rhymes with Wang Anzhi on Attending the Autumn Gathering of Prefect Wang Xuanhui at the Luo Society**
From the inner chambers, guests and kin emerge,
Music played to new melodies, divinely inspired.
When red candles burn bright, sleeves of green flutter,
Where painted oars pause, green duckweed is claimed.
Once a visitor to the golden halls of early years,
Now one soon to depart the Phoenix Pool.
Your estate crowns the capital, called "Snail’s Retreat"—
How dare Shao Yaofu presume to be your western neighbor?

**Poem Expressing Shame for Failing the Three Appointments at Heyang, Heqing, and Jiyuan**
Autumn rains linger, the mud slick and deep,
Day after day, when will the skies clear?
Dear friends long for my arrival,
Yet my frail frame, averse to cold, cannot journey far.
Though the distance is not great,
Twice I set out, twice failed to fulfill the promise.
Two matters war within my breast,
Leaning on my desk, I sit in sorrow, finding no peace.

**Matching Rhymes with Vice Director Wang Anzhi’s Poem on an Autumn Engagement**
Rise and fall—why debate such things?
In the end, all matters even out.
A patch of fleabane and mugwort,
A body of clouds and waters for a thousand years.
The harvest comes at just the right time,
The cold and warmth of qi begin to balance.
From now on, let our meetings bring joy—
Gentlemen, do not weary of their frequency.

**Poem to My Eldest Son, Bowen, on His Failure in the Examinations**
What the Confucians esteem
Are conduct and righteousness, and literary composition.
Success or failure is never certain,
Flourishing or withering not easily measured.
Striving must be diligent,
Gain and loss are the common lot.
External things cannot be relied upon—
His words carry a profound flavor.

**Year’s End Poem to Myself**
The Way of Heaven has no eternal spring,
The Way of Earth no constant treasure.
Only those who receive the harmonious qi of the mean
Can become men of pure excellence.
Good fields yield abundant millet,
Poor soil suffices for brambles and thorns.
The ailanthus and mugwort,
Are fit only to serve as kindling.
Though born as the spirit of the myriad things,
One must possess their essence.
Without the spirit of the myriad things,
One is but a mere part of their kind.
To utter the rarest words,
One must harbor the rarest intent.
To manifest the fairest name,
One must perform the fairest deeds.
Aiding the times is a fair deed,
Enlightening the lord is a rare intent.
Alas, of these two,
I alone possess neither.

**Chant on a Gentleman’s Wine-Drinking**
Father kind, son filial,
Elder brother friendly, younger brother respectful.
Household well-provided, people content,
Times harmonious, years abundant.

**On Physical Well-Being**
Sinews and bones hale and hearty, neighbors and kin in frequent visit.
A gentleman drinks his wine—
His joy knows no bounds.

**Chant on Reading the Biography of Zhang Zifang**
First merit in founding the Han house,
How fine to begin well and end well!
One might suspect the later Red Pine Master
Was none other than the Yellow Stone Elder of old.
Use or retirement follows the times without fixed bounds,
Concealment or action rests with me—now blocked, now free.
The ancients are dead and gone, never to be seen again,
How grievous that few today keep such a spirit!

**Two Chants on Observing Things (Xining Ninth Year)**
The willow’s nature is most supple,
In one year it grows over a yard tall.
Though easily flourishing,
Alas, how easily withered!
All grains look up to the life-giving rain,
The driest stalks turn most lush.
How might this sweet moisture be had,
To briefly revive all living things?

**Five Chants on Order and Chaos**
Disorder outnumbers order,
Harm outnumbers benefit,
Sorrow outnumbers joy,
Ugliness outnumbers beauty.
One yin, one yang—
Why must it be thus?
The Central Plains, a stretch of idle fields,
Once bore the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.
The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had many descendants,
Some base, some poor, some rich, some noble.
Refining principle to the divine for practical use—
"Practical use" means entering and exiting the numinous.
The numinous has no fixed form, the *Changes* no fixed body,
Hidden in function, manifest in benevolence.

**Fire and Water**
Fire can overcome water,
Fire cannot overcome water—then the fire is extinguished.
Water can follow fire,
Water cannot follow fire—then the water stays cold.

**Husband and Wife**
A husband can restrain his wife,
A husband cannot restrain his wife—then the wife turns away.
A wife can follow her husband,
A wife cannot follow her husband—then the wife becomes perverse.

**Heaven and Earth**
Heaven can generate but cannot nurture,
Earth can nurture but cannot generate.
Fire can cook but cannot moisten,
Water can moisten but cannot cook.
Even heaven and earth lack perfect efficacy,
How could water and fire possess perfect power?
When the two attain their use and nourish each other,
They turn instead to oppress each other.

**Thirty-Year Chant**
Compared to thirty years ago,
Today is hardship.
Compared to thirty years hence,
Today is ease.
When order lasts long, people long for chaos,
When chaos lasts long, people long for order.
How might one obtain a thousand-year crane,
To ride away and wander the immortal mountains?

**Chant on Illness**
When the body is ill, one seeks medicine and physician;
If the medicine is not good, the body must suffer.
When the state is ill, one seeks men to heal it;
If the men are not good, the state must be imperiled.
When matters are not yet urgent, swiftly change course;
When matters have grown urgent, though one repent, it is hard to recover.

**Chant Before the Flowers**
This year’s flowers bloom as they did last year,
Today’s man opens them with yesterday’s heart.
Troubles are wholly absent—half a pinch,
Joys are ever present—a hundred cartloads.
Time has passed, but the mind has not,
Teeth and hair may wither, but the will has not.
When asked if Master Yao Fu has gone out,
I reply: "Just now from the grotto-heaven."

**Self-Description**
Warm in spring, cool in autumn, half-drunk,
Leisurely riding a slow carriage, a dust whisk in hand.
Though I lack great virtue to aid the living,
I at least adorn the scene of this era of peace.

**Chant on Departing Office**
When a gentleman departs his office,
The people are left with lingering blessings.
When a petty man departs his office,
The people are left with lingering misfortune.

**Chant with Staff in Hand**
Staff in hand, now in the southern garden, now in the northern,
Spring’s arrival brings especial comfort to declining years.
After the first clear weather following the Lantern Festival,
Just warming winds before the Cold Food Day.
The pond’s banks lightly adorned with tender grass,
The forest’s treetops faintly veiled in thin mist.
At this moment, how generous is the Lord of Spring—
In the midst of the formless, he fashions beauty.

**Chant of No Wishes**
I wish not for the court to appoint me an office,
Nor for the court to bestow upon me grain and silk.
I only wish the court would reduce corvée labor,
That the world might enjoy a little rest.

**Chant on Measuring One’s Strength**
Act according to your strength, and you will have no regrets;
Find joy where you may, and curb your striving.
You may seek a fine steed to ride,
But fear that all your life you will have no horse at all.

**Playful Reply to a Friend’s Chant**
Who is this Shao Yaofu?
Year after year, spring and autumn, he comes to call on you.
His carriage, in half a year, makes but one turn—
Not like a swift horse kicking up fragrant dust.

**Occasional Chant**
Gaoyao met Shun,
Yi Yin encountered Tang,
Wuding found Fu Yue,
King Wen gained Jiang Yuan,
Qi knew Guan Zhong,
Han recognized Zhang Liang,
Zhuge Liang opened Shu,
Xuandi inaugurated Tang.

**Chant on Observing Affairs**
A year’s affairs are diligent in spring,
A day’s affairs are diligent at dawn.
A life’s affairs are diligent in youth,
A single task’s affairs are diligent when new.

**Chant on Observing Things**
When profit is light, principle is weighty;
When profit is weighty, principle is light.
If profit cannot overcome principle,
Sincerity naturally abounds.
If principle cannot overcome profit,
Strife and anger naturally abound.

**Chant on Gold and Jade**
The sage emerges from among men,
The heart is cultivated through conduct.
Gold is found within the sand,
Jade is sought within the stone.

**Chant on Wind and Frost**
Grass bends before the wind,
Grass withers before the frost.
The pine sings before the wind,
The pine stands firm before the frost.
To bend before the wind, to wither before the frost—
How can one be said to exist or perish?

**Chant on High and Low**
From below, looking up—
Boundless wealth and honor.
From above, looking down—
Boundless baseness and poverty.
From the mind, observing things—
What thing can be one?
From things, observing the mind—
What mind is not equal?

**Chant on My Five-Roomed Hut**
Though my hut is small, it roughly shelters me,
At least sparing me the shame of renting another’s lodging.
Many in this world have no house to live in,
Begging warmth beneath another’s eaves.

**Returning from Viewing Apricot Blossoms by the Chan River**
East of the Chan River, apricot blossoms open,
Beyond the flowers, by Tianjin Bridge, I turn back at dusk.
I pluck an apricot blossom to wear in my hair,
To let others know I’ve come to see the flowers.

**Chant on Taking a Wife**
When a man takes a wife,
Let her have beauty, virtue, dignity, and bearing.
Should she bear a son,
Let him be a Gao Yao or a Kui.

**Chant on Good Deeds**
Good deeds are surely hard to force,
Worthy men must be sought with heart.
The floating life of sun and moon is not long—
Once time passes, a thousand regrets, ten thousand regrets.

**Chant of No Return**
Spring does not come again,
Flowers do not bloom again.
Man does not grow young again,
Time does not return again.

**Chant on the Hair-Cutting**
Who shears the hair to thank Lu Chen’s sinking?
The flesh and bones of the living cannot endure such encroachment.

**Chant of Turning the Sky**
In the human realm lies the power to turn the heavens,
Yet in the groves, many harbor hearts that grieve for the nation.
The sun passes its zenith, yet sorrow knows no end;
The moon nears its fullness, yet peril runs deep.
In the army, the scholar’s robes are my family’s way—
Where now to seek the Lord of Martial Might, Zhuge?
A heart that grieves for the nation does so out of love for the lord;
To love the lord, one must hold him dearer than oneself.
What the mouth preaches may not be true—
Only what the hands accomplish is real.
When vain thoughts stir, the mirror fails to reflect;
In the depths of worldly bias, no man is known.
To slander the world as utterly wicked is the gravest calumny—
How many heroes lie buried in the dust below?

**Six Attainments Chant**
The eye can discern,
The ear can hear,
The mouth can speak,
The hand can act,
The body can move,
The heart can let go.
When all six are mastered,
One’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth.
In eating and rising, in going and staying,
In speech and silence—
Not only is the mind at ease,
But effort is spared as well.

**Chant of Rise and Fall**
When power is at its height, one lifts their head in arrogance;
When qi wanes, they turn on their heel to sigh in despair.
To slander the world as full of worthies—
How could the world ever be so falsely maligned?

**Chant of Wealth and Nobility**
Great Shun shared the likes and dislikes of the people,
Thus following their desires to bring them peace.
To know that wealth and nobility are but ordinary things—
He who is made proud by wealth and nobility is no true man.

**Chant of No Delusion**
Let the ear hear no falsehood,
The eye gaze upon no vanity,
The mouth speak no idle words,
The heart harbor no reckless thoughts.
When these four are free of delusion,
They become the tools of sages and worthies.
Who am I, that I dare not aspire to emulate them?

**Chant of Good and Evil**
If one does not pursue goodness in others nor rid oneself of evil,
To claim knowledge of the Dao—is this not difficult indeed?

**Chant of a Spring Day in the Garden**
Spring’s warmth invites a stroll through the garden—nothing unusual,
Yet within this realm, it differs little from the land of immortals.
Daily among the bamboo, I keep company with true friends;
By the waterside, we often raise cups of wine.
After rain, birdsong flits through the trees;
Before the wind, the fragrance of flowers assails the senses.
Amid the groves, wealth and nobility bring the same joy—
Let them come freely, for there is no harm in it.

**Chant of Interpreting Words**
Man’s words are trust,
The sun and moon are brightness.

**On the Character "武"**
"武" is made by halting the spear—peace through strength;
"羹" is made with lamb’s flesh—harmony in the pot.

**Chant of Reflection on Affairs**
Orchids planted yet fail to flourish,
Thorns carved yet refuse to vanish.
Helpless before these two,
I linger as the year nears its close.

**Chant of Adversity and Success**
Adversity cannot bend me,
Success cannot make me lax.
To claim knowledge of the Dao—is this not difficult indeed?

**Chant of the Cosmos**
The cosmos rests within my hand,
All things dwell within my frame.
Vast and unceasing as if present,
How could their use ever weary?

**Chant of Prolonged Drought**
After long drought, we yearn for rain;
After long rain, we long for sun.
Such is the constant Way of Heaven,
Such is the nature of man.

**Chant of Cultivating Nature**
Cultivate nature, let it endure;
Focus the will, let it not divide.
What fear then remains
Of falling short of the ancients?

**Chant of Paths**
The path before me need not be narrow—
When paths grow narrow, no travelers pass.
When travelers cease, paths turn to waste,
And the world is mostly brambles and thorns.

**Chant of the Great Man**
The Way of Heaven is distant,
The way of man is near.
Fulfill human sentiment,
Align with Heaven’s principle.

**Chant of the Primordial (For Xing He-Shu)**
A single expanse of the primordial, called the Great Void,
In its quiescence, reveals true richness.
Who would flaunt the treasures within their breast?
The world’s finest talents suffer grave slander.
When principle flows smoothly, all words may be released;
Where righteousness finds rest, what place cannot be home?
Only after the cosmos settles in tranquility
Does one truly believe that heroes walk among men.

**Chant of Reflection on Affairs**
In doing good, measure your strength and portion;
Discerning opportunity lies in understanding human nature.
When human nature is exhausted, doubts become insurmountable;
When strength is measured, affairs naturally find balance.
Where principle flows, all before you is a path;
Where righteousness falters, thorns block the gate.
Who would heed these words?
Yet these words are clear—why do men not listen?

**Chant of the Great Song**
What is called discerning opportunity?
Only the divine can fathom the subtle.
Action and stillness rest entirely with me;
Use and rejection depend on the times.
Ever do I regret recognizing men too late,
Ever do I worry perceiving affairs too slowly.
Only when one becomes one with Heaven
Does one truly know the wisdom of Confucius.

**Chant of Fame and Gain**
Fame and gain never enter my breast,
Thus my breast’s qi surges freely.
Both love and hate are maladies—
When shall my spirit terrace find repose?

**Chant from On High**
Who transforms cruel poisons of a thousand kinds
Into a single stream of gracious light?
Mourning that the ancients are no more,
I lean on high and sigh deeply.

**Chant of Intent Fulfilled**
Intent is fulfilled in things,
Words are fulfilled in sincerity.
To feign emotion and dominate things—
This is not within my power.

**Two More Chants of the Great Song**
Sorrow and joy,
A hair’s breadth apart.
Order and chaos differ in form,
Yet mountains and rivers remain unchanged.
The sound of a flute drifts from afar;
Grasses and trees appear in the distance.
From some lofty tower,
A man leans on the railing as the sun sets.

Fine virtue is hard to find—
Wise one, it is best to desist.
Treading frost may yet be remedied;
Felling trees—what more is there to seek?
Beasts, when trapped, await another day;
Geese, when they fly, depart with autumn’s end.
When the people hunger, they must be fed—
Beyond feeding, all is but idle thought.

**Chant of Gentleness and Kindness**
The gentleman’s gentleness and kindness demand scrutiny;
The petty man’s deceit and falsity must also be known.
Startled by the world’s treacherous schemes,
I find the days and months within my gourd pass slowly.

**Chant of the Gentleman**
The gentleman aligns with righteousness,
The petty man with profit.
Aligned with righteousness, he daily rises;
Aligned with profit, he daily declines.
The gentleman values virtue,
The petty man values force.
Valuing virtue plants kindness;
Valuing force plants enmity.
The gentleman creates blessings,
The petty man wields power.
Creating blessings brings blessings;
Wielding power brings calamity.
The gentleman delights in goodness,
The petty man delights in evil.
Delighting in evil invites evil;
Delighting in goodness invites goodness.
The gentleman seeks praise,
The petty man seeks slander.
Seeking slander provokes anger;
Seeking praise brings joy.
The gentleman thinks of prosperity,
The petty man thinks of ruin.
Thinking of prosperity summons fortune;
Thinking of ruin summons misfortune.
The gentleman delights in giving,
The petty man delights in demanding.
Delighting in giving brings much joy;
Delighting in demanding brings much sorrow.
The gentleman delights in life,
The petty man delights in killing.
Delighting in life, the Way flourishes;
Delighting in killing, the Way perishes.

**Chant of the Primordial**
Before Heaven, do not oppose it;
After Heaven, follow its seasons.
Not opposing never falters;
Following seasons sometimes wearies.

**Chant of Refreshment**
Few are the flavors that refresh the palate;
Few are the deeds that refresh the heart;
Few are the words that refresh the mind;
Few are the acts that refresh the body.

**Chant of Utmost Sincerity**
Seeking little, thus one attains;
Departing not from learning, thus one is enlightened.
To keep the heart ever bright,
Nothing surpasses utmost sincerity.

**Chant of Recording Events**
Other mountains’ stones can polish jade—
Before the jade is fully wrought, age hastens me.
Bounded time slips away with each affair;
Unbounded decay follows man’s steps.
A thousand poems refine temperament and nature;
A cup of wine harmonizes sinew and bone.
Sixty-six years without a day of leisure—
Only now does my heart’s source begin to shine.

**In Reply to Scholar Ning’s Request for Poems**
Idle words beneath the pines—
Why need there be so many?
Three hundred poems or so
Are enough for chanting and recitation.

**Chant of Poetry and Wine**
The Sage’s words are hard to convey—
How could they last but a thousand or ten thousand years?
Only with a tranquil heart can one know the bright sun;
Only with clear eyes can one see the azure sky.
Ghosts and spirits’ forms are written in poetry;
Creation’s work is passed down through wine.
Without poetry and wine, these matters would not be conveyed—
And without poetry and wine, how could they be spoken?

**Chant of the White-Haired**
Who does not grow white-haired?
My whiteness comes not from sorrow.
Only because men are full of desires—
How can I be like them, untroubled?
Untroubled because I do not stir;
Full of desires because I seek much.
Aging is the common lot of men—
How could one not grow white-haired?

**Chant of the True Listener**
Only Confucius could speak of having no intent;
Only Mencius could speak of an unshaken heart.
Seek not white jade in the mountains—
Find yellow gold within yourself.
White jade in the mountains may sometimes be found;
Yellow gold within oneself is nowhere to be sought.
Who are we to dare claim understanding?
How can we know there are no true listeners in the world?

*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Sixteen Concludes*
*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Seventeen*

**Chant of Humanity and Things**
Man broken must be mended,
Things broken must be repaired.
Yet mending and repairing, though many,
End only in exposure and ruin.
Man has man’s sentiments,
Things have things’ principles.
Though man and things differ in kind,
How can sentiments and principles be distinct?

**Chance Encounter Chant**
In the woods, with nothing to occupy the heart,
I nap through the day, rewarded with a cup of wine.
The lingering dream cannot be fully recalled—
Half drifts with wind and rain down the eastern street.

**Contemplating Things Chant**
With the first division of qi,
The Two Modes are already complete.
The round is Heaven,
The square is Earth.
Transformation gives rise to life,
Movement and stillness bring forth kinds.
Man stands between them,
Most numinous, most noble.

**Warring States Chant**
In the time of the Seven States, war was prized;
Might and cunning, deceit and force, all flourished together.
Lian Po and Bai Qi excelled in command,
Su Qin and Zhang Yi in stratagem.
At dawn a commoner, by dusk a lord—
Yesterday feasting from the tripod, today cooked within it.
Fan Sui, dismissed from office—what was his heart?
Cai Ze, entering Qin—on what did he rely?
The First Emperor roused his sleeves, and the world was pacified;
The Second begged to be a mere clod of earth, yet could not.
Three thousand retainers’ resentment was not yet spent,
When the hundred and two rivers of Qin gave way to Han.
Of all that remained, only empty names—
The fading sun, withered grass, the shapes of mountains and streams.
It all passed like a spring dream;
What more need be said of might and ferocity?

**Stirred by Events Chant**
A sword that cuts jade like mud is no idle boast—
Who knows that in this world there is Kunwu steel?
To speak well is not yet to be a true man;
Only he who acts rightly deserves the name of great man.
To grow old among woods and springs is my true wish,
Yet the people fill the ditches—what guilt is theirs?
Though it is not my affair, my heart aches;
I cherish this scroll of Fuxi’s ancient script.

**Five Further Chants**
All things possess their essence,
Man is the spirit of all things.
First examine the nature of affairs,
Then discuss the sentiments of men.
When qi is tranquil, the form is at ease and joyful;
When the heart is idle, the body is at great peace.
When the Lord of Yi and Qi governed the world,
They did not go beyond this principle of life.

Using medicine is like waging war—
When war is waged, can there be peace?
Seeking peace, peace is not attained;
Banishing illness, illness returns.
Decoctions do not fully restore,
While rich foods only provoke strife.
How then may one attain long life?
The auspicious sign of the Old Man Star.

All things turn on the Dao as their pivot,
Yet their origins differ in kind.
Though their natures are neither thick nor thin,
Their principles vary in refinement and coarseness.
Nothing compares to man in splendor—
Yet know that things, too, have their abundance.
Born in this age,
I am fortunate not to be a common man.

I have heard, but hearing is not like seeing;
I have seen, but seeing is not like experiencing.
Having applied the heart to experience,
Why trouble the mouth with words and deeds?
Revising poetry, one knows the transforming power of the brush;
Sobering from wine, one recognizes the harmony of the broth.
I reckon the affairs of men—
None escape this sentiment.

Before us lie a hundred million years,
After us, a hundred million ages.
Between them, the long-lived man
Scarcely reaches a hundred.
From his mouth come no good words,
In his conduct, no good deeds.
He merely possesses the form of man,
Yet lacks man’s true nobility.

**Treading the Dao Chant**
What age has lacked men to raise the radiance of virtue?
Today, the many worthies gather in the western capital.
The flourishing of culture and refinement in this time of peace
Surpasses even the full splendor of the Yuanhe era.

**Seeing Right Action Chant**
When one sees what is right, one must act;
When one does not see, then let it be.

**Measuring Strength Chant**
Act according to one’s strength; cease when strength is spent.

**Observing Things Chant**
Like the luan or phoenix, their bearing serene—
Those born thus are loyal or good.
Like the rat or sparrow, their bearing skittish—
Those born thus are wicked or cruel.

**Nobles Chant**
Nobles and great men, the world looks to them;
Careless habits spread, grave harm to their dignity.
This alone unfinished, how can they attend to that?
Not for lack of the Dao, but for the rise of greed again.
Topped with a scholar’s cap, their hearts hold Buddhist signs.
They sought peace of mind, yet stir their minds to noise.
Like raising a child—one should seek resemblance,
Yet teach not virtue, but theft instead.

**Self-Reflection Chant**
Old age comes with no achievement, teeth and hair decline,
Near seventy years—what is there left to do?
At home, no illness, no need for medicine;
Now and then, moved by feeling, I still write poems.
Drawing water, I delight as fish gather near;
Plucking flowers, I rejoice as butterflies follow.
A lifetime of learning yields no other fruit—
Only this: my heart is free of turmoil.

**Observing Things Chant**
The painter depicts things over months and years;
The mirror reflects them instantly before us.
The mirror’s clarity may yet lack precision;
The craftsman’s hand may render unevenness.
Of all things level in the world, none compares to water.
It reflects the surface but not what lies within.
To see both surface and depth—only the sage.
Scrutinizing words and deeds, nothing escapes truth.
Fulfilling the nature of things, shedding one’s own feelings—
The virtuous must speak;
Those who speak may not act.

**Sleeplessness Chant**
Great shock brings no sleep, great sorrow no sleep,
Great grief no sleep, great illness no sleep,
Great joy no sleep—only great peace brings sleep.
Why no sleep? Entangled in cares.
Why sleep? Free of affairs.

**Two Zhegu Chants**
In the world, gold is prized above all—
Who says gold cannot be found?
Without idle words or refined intent,
What else can gladden a good heart?
Distant mountains on all sides offer pure freshness,
Hidden birds in a thousand songs send sweet sounds.
Though boundless spring has faded away,
Pray, listen to the zhegu’s cry.

Deep in emerald bamboo groves, the zhegu calls,
Its voice more stirring than the wine-pourer’s song.
North and south of the river, they ever follow,
After spring, before spring, they call of their own accord.
Exiled officials, hearts broken, startle from dreams;
Traveling soldiers, tears soak their collars.
Hearing it in sorrow, the bowels first sever—
Can such grief be endured?

**Primordial Chant**
If asked of the Primordial—there is not a single word;
Only in the Later Heaven does effort begin.
Boasting strength to move mountains and overshadow the age—
At this, can one force even a hair’s worth?

**Self-Joy Chant**
The qilin and phoenix have never left the wilds;
In times of peace, why fret and clamor?
Hearing of good deeds, my heart rejoices first;
Seeing rare books, my hands copy them myself.
Beneath bamboo, a tile’s worth of clear spring flows;
Atop pines, two rods of red sun rise.
Awake in my nest, I sit before it—
How could idle words dispel guests’ mockery?

**People’s Sentiments Chant**
When the people’s hearts are joyful, harmonious qi brings blessings.
When the people’s hearts are troubled, harsh qi brings calamity.
Blessings are like rain and dew—all under heaven prospers.
Calamity is like flood and drought—all under heaven suffers famine.

**Peony Chant**
The peony’s grace outshines all flowers,
And among them, some are kings.
Four hues transform into a hundred,
A hundred hues, a hundred fragrances.

**Letter in Verse Chant**
Gold must be smelted a hundred times to know its purity;
How can a water-mirror compare to a man’s discernment?
Not discarding old friends, one preserves them;
How dare one forget lifelong bonds?
Affairs of state demand practical words;
The Dao and virtue rest on sincerity alone.
Before the myriad grasses and trees,
Only the pine and cassia stay green through the cold.

**Minor Illness Chant**
When illness is slight, none suspect it;
When it deepens, medicine cannot cure.
Through diligence and humility, one ends well;
Through confusion and relapse, great loss follows.
Between self and things, no room for a hair’s breadth;
Between heaven and man, how can a thread intrude?
Knowing ancient joy is like present joy—
How many needless words are spared?

**Borrowed Poems**
Poems wild, books unconstrained—
In recent years, they’ve multiplied beyond count.
Most have scattered across the world,
Unreturned to the Nest of Peace.

**Effortless Chant**
In life, no forced verses,
No striving for depth in brush or ink.
The brush moves as the nature flows;
The poem forms to express the heart.
Poetry soars with the heart’s creativity,
The brush blooms like a garden of the mind.
What I delight in is my own delight—
Delight without excess.

**Myriad Things Chant**
All things are complete within oneself;
Heaven and earth do not fail man.
Time slips away like grass in the wind;
Affairs fall into routine.
Grieving that youth fades,
Startled by new white hairs.
If the heart holds nothing,
One becomes but dust—or flees like dust.

**Moon’s Hollow Chant**
The Moon’s Hollow and Heaven’s Root,
Between them, frequent comings and goings.
Wherever one dwells, all is ample;
Wherever one goes, all is at ease.
Each step finds its place;
The heart is full of spring.
Without poetry and wine,
How greatly one would be diminished!

**Great Image Chant**
The Great Image is empty at its core,
Its emptiness truly unchanging.
In action, it is the heart’s work;
In response, the mouth’s skill.
Relying on capacity, a thousand things exist;
With a single care, none remain.
Who knows this principle
Outweighs reading five cartloads of books.

**Hundred Ills Chant**
A hundred ills arise from feeling;
Light feeling, light illness.
Can one be without attachments?
Yet there is always something to rely on.
Autumn moon, a thousand mountains still;
Spring blossoms, ten thousand trees flourish.
If speaking of true work,
Human effort cannot contrive it.

**Small Cart Chant**
Spring’s warmth not yet oppressive,
Autumn’s chill not yet severe.
The small cart follows whim;
Wherever it goes, joy arises.

**Striking the Earth Chant**
Three thousand poems of *Striking the Earth*,
Twelve households of *Moving Nests*.
Taking joy as one’s work,
Cultivating the will as one’s livelihood.
Coming and going as one pleases,
Visiting in a small cart.
Who knows this joy
Needs not wait for splendor?

**Two Poems Left at the Northern Waters of Yang, Gentleman of the Bureau’s Garden and Pavilion**
Since ancient times, buying a dwelling has prized the sight of mountains—
How much does it cost to see mountains today?

Peaks of wonder encircle afar, parted by waters,
Towering trees loom low, lightly veiled in mist.
Travelers on the road suspect they pass through immortal grottoes,
Those leaning on railings fear they’ve become transcendent beings.

Ever dreading unseen entry into a painter’s hand,
To be rendered on silk and spread through the world.
In Luoyang, who does not buy a dwelling?
Yet who else buys one like yours?

A scene of radiance, no dust of this world,
Landscape through four seasons, a true painted scroll.
The rear garden’s blossoms, rare as those of Penglai,
The front pavilion’s peaks, fine as those of Penglai’s isles.

To grow old in such a place—
This too is the mark of a hero in the world.

**Chant at Autumn’s End**
Within days, autumn is spent,
A hundred thoughts cannot console its passing.
The garden’s beauty, though loved without end,
Yet grasses and trees yellow—what can feeling do?

Though aged, my limbs still strong,
From every high terrace, my gaze still far.
All day I raise my cup, yet not drunk,
Again I long to face the wind and sing boldly.

**Chant of the Unworthy**
The unworthy man,
His will set on wandering,
Body beneath the roof,
Heart above it.

The unworthy son,
His will set on vanity,
His own self not secure,
How can he secure his home?

**Chant of the Noble One**
The noble one’s departure,
Is as his arrival.
The petty man’s arrival,
Is as his departure.

Where there has been kindness,
Let there be no resentment.
Where there has been aversion,
Let there be no longing.

**Chant of the Petty Man**
The petty man has no constancy,
Abandoning root for branch,
Delighted when he gains,
Enraged when he loses.

**Chant of Grasping Hands**
Wealth and honor grasp hands,
Poverty and lowliness pull back.
Poverty and lowliness grasp hands,
Wealth and honor pull back.

Friendship of metal and stone,
Endures even unto death.
Friendship of the marketplace,
Hardly lasts long.

**Chant of the Great Changes**
Heaven and Earth take their places,
Adversity and prosperity reverse their forms.
Mountains and marshes share qi,
Increase and decrease reveal rightness.

Thunder and wind press close,
Constancy and benefit arise in intent.
Water and fire clash,
Completion and incompletion alternate.

The four images intersect,
Forming sixteen matters.
The eight trigrams stir one another,
Becoming sixty-four.

**Chant of Ceasing Chants**
Long have I wished to cease my chants,
Yet startled—my intent suddenly strange.
Seated, I know the nature of things,
Beyond words, I reach the celestial mechanism.

To gain a line is not so easy,
To complete a verse—how could I bear to discard it?
Who knows if in a thousand myriad ages,
A later age will lack its Confucius?

**Chant of Gold**
On the body, gold is carried,
No man sinks in his journey.
When sought, it may not appear,
When found, not through seeking.

Eloquence is not understanding,
Containment is the completion of the heart.
Only when one can play the stringless zither,
Can one then know the true friend.

**Chant of the Partridge**
Affairs take on a new form,
Yet newness soon turns old.
New and old are not beneficial things,
Principle does not follow man.

Do not fear the lateness of years,
Orioles and blossoms will herald spring again.
My remaining cup, fortunately unharmed,
Fitting to sing the partridge’s song often.

**Chant of Leisure**
In leisure, the flavor lingers long,
The long place is the land of immortals.
Abundant is the joy of forests and springs,
Pure, without the clamor of markets.

Freely roaming the mysteries of a thousand sages,
Drunk, embracing the fragrance of ten thousand flowers.
Do not make matters of heartbreak,
Heartbreak easily severs the bowels.

In leisure, the flavor is true,
The true place is the people of heaven.
Abundant is the joy of forests and springs,
Pure, without the dust of markets.

Freely roaming the mysteries of a thousand sages,
Drunk, embracing the spring of ten thousand flowers.
Do not make matters of heartbreak,
Heartbreak saddens and kills.

In leisure, the flavor is complete,
The complete place is the celestial immortal.
Abundant is the joy of forests and springs,
Pure, without the noise of markets.

Freely observing the mysteries of a thousand sages,
Drunk, embracing the beauty of ten thousand flowers.
Do not make matters of heartbreak,
Heartbreak is best turned away.

**Chant of the Vast Blue**
Every person bears the sky,
Do I bear it in vain?
One must know the principle of heaven and man,
Only then to know the power of creation.

Merit and fame return to the wine cup,
Vessels and deeds enter the poem.
I reckon the joy of leisure,
None compares to my wholeness.

**Chant of the Round**
Like a mirror, like a hook,
Revolving, autumn unremembered.
Hard to fathom the ways of heaven,
Easy to whiten the heads of the world.

In fullness, all rejoice,
In waning, all things grieve.
There is no life without breath,
Why wait for the ox of Wu to pant?

**Chant in Place of a Letter**
A year and more since we parted,
At year’s end, our thoughts turn to the beginning.
Again I trouble you with warmth,
To send afar my emptiness.

A hundred forms of decay and ruin,
Yet not a single care.
Idle chanting of forty words,
To briefly answer your letter.

**Chant of the Lost Poem**
Within my breast, wind and rain roar,
Beneath my brush, dragons and serpents move.
Before and after, they fall among men,
Over three thousand in number.

**Chant of Not Ceasing**
At sixty-six years,
Two things I do not cease:
With poetry, I offer to the true lord,
With wine, I toast the image-emperor.

My face has not yet flushed,
My heart first stirs harmonious qi.
Looking up and down between heaven and earth,
I know myself without shame.

**Chant of Ordering the World**
Fuxi, Shennong, Yao, Shun,
Tang, Wu, Huan, Wen;
August kings, emperors, lords, and chiefs,
Fathers and sons, rulers and ministers.

The Way of these four,
Its principle ended with Qin,
Descending to the two Han,
Then passing through the Three Kingdoms.

East and west in turmoil,
North and south in chaos.
Five Hu, ten clans,
The celestial order nearly burned.

Without Tang, there would be no salvation,
Without Song, no preservation.
For a thousand ages, ten thousand ages,
The Central Plains have had men.

**Chant of Knowing Men**
The noble one knows men through understanding,
The petty man knows men through self-interest.
Through understanding,
Those in accord with principle are deemed right, those at odds are deemed wrong.
Through self-interest,
Those in accord with oneself are deemed right, those at odds are deemed wrong.

**Chant of Words and Deeds**
To speak well is not difficult,
To act is the true challenge.
One must be a true man,
Only then can one be without shamelessness.

**Chant of Time**
Three hundred and sixty-six days,
Time passes before the eye like a rushing wheel.
Revolving without cease,
How can the four seasons long resemble spring?

**Chant of Raising the Cup**
Leisurely with guests and friends, raising the wine cup,
In the cup, flowers ever seem to bloom.
Pure discourse just leaves the mouth,
Harmonious qi already arises from the heart.

Intent beyond things is not gained from images,
Amidst sitting, spring does not return from heaven.
If this could be applied to the world,
What worry would the world not cast aside?

**Chant of Too Little Wine**

**Chant of This Thing (Wine)**
Lately scarce for the poor,
Yet now and then, a few pounds gained.
Like tea, it betrays the aged,
Like medicine, it fails old friends.
Before drinking, fear it will run dry,
Though poured, dare not drink too deep.
How to share it on Double Ninth,
With white-robed guests ever near?

**Quatrain on Watching Chess**
Unshaken by the urge to vie,
Yet black and white still grip the mind.
One path stands peerless,
Fully seen, yet none pursue.

Unshaken by the urge to vie,
Yet black and white still stir the heart.
One path lies smooth and sure,
Yet none tread—what a waste!

**Chant of Growing Old**
Grown old, no achievements, temples streaked with gray,
How many years remain to follow the heart’s ease?
How to find content beyond clouds and peaks,
And wander still in poetry and wine?
Large characters write poems to fulfill plain aims,
Small cups pour wine to flush the cheeks with red.
Spring thunder rouses creatures buried for a thousand years,
Beneath the brush, the azure dragon moves to and fro.

**Chant of Scattered Stones**
Tianjin’s shores are strewn with stones,
Amidst which I idly seek.
Pure jade is hard to find,
Jade-like stones are rare as well.
Some are dull and green,
Others gleam with phosphorescent white.
Yet none ring with a clear, ringing tone,
Nor bear the warmth and luster of true jade.

**Chant of Having Nothing**
No merit to my name,
Yet enemies I’ve made tenfold.
Nothing gained,
Yet losses know no bound.

No yielding in the least,
Yet strife I’ve stirred tenfold.
What’s lost is substance,
What’s gained is but an empty name.

**Chant of Admonishing a Son**
The rarest pearl is flawless,
The finest jade is without blemish.
If pearls and jade must be so,
How much more should a man strive to be without fault?
Failing to correct one’s errors,
Refusing to draw near the wise—
Though born into this world,
One cannot be called truly human.
Zhou and Kong are not enough to emulate,
Meng and Xiong not enough to follow.
One might as well abandon common fare,
Or flee to the wilds of the barbarians.
The Dao is not far from man,
For heaven and earth reside within the self.
Who seeks them beyond this,
Will find them nowhere else.

**Chant of Hu and Yue**
On the day Hu and Yue are of one heart,
Husband and wife turn against each other.
In this world, no matter great or small,
Gain and loss hang by a thread.

**Chant of Good Conduct**
To act well in times of trouble is hard,
Yet holding fast refines the self.
With nothing foreign in heart or mind,
Even barbarians grow gentle.

**Chant of a Hundred Years**
A hundred years slip by in haste,
A thousand miles stretch desolate and bleak.
How can one bear to follow the eastward-flowing waters,
Drifting without end, at the mercy of the tide?

**Chant of Year’s End**
Day by day, the days depart,
Year by year, the years accrue.
Though one may yet become a vessel great,
Alas, the temples have already turned to frost.
The will remains unchanged,
Yet wit and brightness fade.
Were it not for the heart’s attainment,
One might well aspire to be an immortal.

**Short Chant on Watching Chess**
Who says board games are mere leisure,
When gain and loss grind on without cease?
At the first advantage, look ahead,
Where strategy is needed, tarry not.
Two years to right the Three Supervisors’ crimes,
Seven days to occupy the Two Observatories.
When the world is at peace, with nothing amiss,
What more could one seek than reclining in Nanyang?

**Another Poem on Lending Out**
In the nest of peace and joy,
A myriad pipes of Nüwa’s panpipes resound.
Since lending it out in idleness,
Guests arrive, yet no delight remains.

**In Response to Wang Guifu’s Gift of "On Movement"**
Not just a thousand or ten thousand years,
The frost-defying pine and cassia stand alone.
Were it not for Yangzi’s learning of heaven and man,
How could Zhuangzi’s inner and outer chapters exist?
Already we’ve agreed to seek white stones by the moonlit pool,
And further to play with clear springs in Golden Valley.
Who says the clamor of shadows is too great?
Let the peaks rise and rise again.

**Chant in Reply to a Friend Urging Wine**
Who does not wish to be enfeoffed as a marquis?
Yet once enfeoffed, none are content to stop.
Great gains must guard against great losses,
Many worries stem from many desires.
How dare I compare myself to men of talent?
I know my measure is not that of a drinking sage.
How could I have forced myself in younger days?
Now, with age and snow upon my head, even less so.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Seventeen Concludes*
*Yichuan Jirang Ji, Volume Eighteen*

**Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu’s “Winter Solstice Chant”**
What is called the subtle moment?
The heavenly root, the principle most fine.
Here at the year’s final close,
There at the morrow yet to arrive.
This juncture is easily grasped,
Yet none refuse its fleeting sign.
Who knows this truth may guard their affairs,
But few can fathom its design.

**“Cup and Plate Chant”**
Beneath the trees, cups and plates lie still in quietude,
And long I wish this quietude would last as now it does.
Behold those who beat drums and strike bells—
Once their power wanes, friends are not easily called.

**“Joyful Chant”**
Praise the good, not the ill,
Remember kindness, not grudges.
Let each rejoice in themselves,
What need to lament few companions?

**“Virtuous Chant”**
Good as gold and jade,
Weighty as hills and mountains,
Dignified as phoenix and simurgh,
Fragrant as orchid and angelica.

**“Discourse Chant”**
If a matter is wrong, it stands apart.
If a matter is right, how could there be two ways?

**“Sincerity Chant”**
Though heaven does not speak, man may speak,
Yet when the heart may be deceived, heaven may be deceived.
Heaven and man are not far apart,
But only in the human heart do men not see.
The human heart precedes heaven, and heaven does not oppose it;
The human body follows heaven, serving its time.
Body and heart are not far apart,
But only in human sincerity do men not reflect.

**“Yaofu’s Chant”**
Yaofu chants: the world calls me dull,
Coming without season, going without measure.
Like mountains and rivers, my path knows no end;
Like streams and seas, my flow knows no cease.
Like orchid and angelica, my fragrance never fades;
Like the *Xiaoshao* music, my sound never breaks.
There are flowers, there is snow,
There is wind, there is moon.
Now gentle, now stern;
Now refined, now fervent.

**“Unexpected Chant”**
When matters arise beyond expectation,
Foresight cannot grasp them.
If not moved by recklessness,
Why indulge in needless sorrow?
Even in error there may be fortune,
And in darkness, unseen guidance.
Who understands this truth,
What worry remains under heaven?

**“Decisive Chant”**
Decide to resolve doubt—doubt must not linger.
To hesitate when one should decide
Is to invite chaos in return.

**“Dream of Worry Chant”**
The perfected have no dreams,
The sages have no worries.
Dreams come from overthinking,
Worries from overreaching.
If worries do not arise,
From where do dreams come?
Who understands this truth,
What more need they cultivate?

**“Human Sentiment Chant”**
To understand human sentiment,
Neither narrow nor broad.
All under heaven’s affairs
Are as clear as one’s palm.

**“Human Affairs Chant”**
Men must not act carelessly,
Matters must not be left to drift.
Drifting loses the moment,
Carelessness corrupts the man.
Men must not act rashly,
Matters prize attentiveness.
Rashness leans toward shallowness,
Attentiveness leans toward sincerity.

**“Teacher and Resource Chant”**
Not yet knowing the Dao’s meaning,
One seeks others as teachers.
Once knowing the Dao’s meaning,
Others come as resources.
Seeking teachers is not easy,
Being a resource is truly hard.
Pointing south to guide the Way,
Neither departing nor returning.
To feel shame at teaching others,
To feel joy at being taught—
Both are misplaced.
I alone am free of this.
To delight in teaching others,
How is this different from obstinacy?

**“Heaven and Man Chant”**
Heaven’s study is to cultivate the heart,
Man’s study is to cultivate the body.
When body is at peace and heart is joyful,
Then heaven and man are seen.
Heaven and man are not far apart,
Yet few know this—
Those who do are rare.
The body is governed by man,
The heart is governed by heaven.
If the heart is not joyful,
How can the body be at peace?

**“Yue Yi Chant”**
When Yue Yi served Yan,
His heart held a profound intent.
Breaking Qi’s seventy cities,
His blade met no resistance.
Why spare Jimo and Ju?
Yet his loyalty to Yan remained unbroken.
He wished for Yan to become king,
And for all under heaven to begin with Qi.
Was his will not yet fulfilled
When King Zhao suddenly died?
King Hui, ignorant of his worth,
Sent another to replace him.
Mighty Yan declined from then,
Never again to rise.
Since ancient times, lord and minister—
Their meeting is not easily found.
How precious are these thousand myriad years,
That move even heroes to tears.

**“The Perfect Ten Chant”**
What is called a perfect man?
One must possess perfect truth.
Not merely one who writes well,
Nor one who composes fine prose.
Not for fine brows and bright eyes,
Nor for new robes and fresh clothes.
To walk in the world of men,
One must first perfect the self.

What is called a perfect man?
One must accomplish perfect deeds.
If deeds are not perfect,
They remain incomplete.
Serving one’s father with whole heart,
Serving one’s elder brother with whole intent,
Serving one’s lord with whole loyalty,
Serving one’s teacher with whole duty.
A man’s life spans a hundred years,
How easily it passes!
Though but a fleeting moment,
How much transpires within!
To be called one who completes affairs,
One must first complete the self.
If the self is not yet complete,
How can one complete others?

**“Birthday Chant”**
*Cyclic signs: Xin-Hai, twelfth month, twenty-fifth day*
Year: Xin-Hai, month: Xin-Chou,
Day: Jia-Zi, hour: Jia-Xu.
Day and hour share Jia,
Year and month share Xin.
At this moment,
I was born into this world as man.

**“Admonition to My Sons Chant”**
The rooster can herald dawn,
The horse can take one’s place in travel,
The dog can guard and defend,
The ox can plow the fields.
Man, born between heaven and earth,
Spirit of all things—
Yet envying the worthy and resenting the able,
Better not to have been born at all.

**“The Constant Chant”**
Heaven and earth have constant principles,
Sun and moon have constant brightness.
The four seasons have constant order,
Ghosts and spirits have constant numinosity.
The sage has constant virtue,
The petty man has no constant disposition.

**“Yearning Chant”**
The world’s splendor fades from sight,
Before my eyes, only books command reverence.
Though a hundred thousand hardships still startle,
The years before thirty were the most bitter.
In youth, I knew only perilous paths,
In old age, I recognize the peace of ease.
Fortunate that my family’s legacy has heirs,
Enough to wander carefree with the white clouds.

**“Spring Chant”**
A piece of spring lies before my eyes,
Before my eyes, know this good spring.
Spring, autumn, winter, summer—free of burdens,
Snow, moon, wind, flowers—all flow as one.
To use true richness for one’s work,
Why fear other things harming its warmth and beauty?
How fortunate is my life—what abundance!
How could idle sorrows reach my ears?

**“Nearly There Chant”**
To demand saintliness of others
Is surely not yet complete.
To expect humanity from others
Leaves room for improvement.
Holding others to account is not hard,
But receiving reproach is not easy.
To be nearly there—
One still looks to Yanzi.

**“People and Things Chant”**
People flourish and must decline,
Things arise and must perish.

**“On Seeing Those Before Me”**
Having seen those who came before,
I now know what comes after.
If those before could rise,
How could what follows be abandoned?
Rise and fall begin with people,
Only then do we speak of heaven and earth.

**“Sighs of Amazement Chant”**
Yesterday, burning with power,
Today, caught in the net.
Such are the common affairs of men—
Why gasp in amazement, why sigh?

**“Left-Lapelled Robes Chant”**
Since ancient times, no supreme strategy has governed the frontier,
Only by virtue and righteousness does the Central Plain stand.
The royal army’s punitive campaign may be justified,
But how can one bear to speak of the Son of Heaven’s exile?
The two Jin dynasties fell into chaos and became overgrown grass,
The three lords endured humiliation, their names stricken from the records.
Who were Gong, Lü, Yan, and Guang?
Only now do I believe that reviving a nation begins with a single word.

**“Teaching and Exhortation Chant”**
To claim sageliness or benevolence—I dare not,
Yet empty words still suffice to console this fleeting life.
To clearly expound teaching and exhortation is the constant Way,
That descendants may forever uphold a good name.
Though today’s legacy remains obscure,
The blessings received in time to come will not be light.
If this intent flows throughout the world,
How could the world fail to know great peace?

**“The Unvirtuous Chant”**
Alas for the unvirtuous,
Endowed with cruel and violent power.
Not only do they ruin families,
But they can also ruin nations.

**“Many Affairs Chant”**
Many affairs invite worry,
Many doubts invite vexation,
Many gifts invite stinginess,
Many takings invite loss.

**“Conducting Oneself Chant”**
The noble person in conduct
Prefers others to wrong them rather than wrong others.
The petty person in affairs
Prefers to wrong others rather than be wronged by them.

**“Observing Nature Chant”**
People of a thousand myriad years,
Affairs of a thousand myriad years,
Passions of a thousand myriad years,
Principles of a thousand myriad years.
Only through learning can one
Sit and contemplate them all in clarity.

**“Observing Things Chant”**
Dwelling in darkness, observe the bright;
Dwelling in stillness, observe the moving;
Dwelling in simplicity, observe the complex;
Dwelling in lightness, observe the weighty.
What one dwells in is few,
What one observes is many.
Without dwelling, without observing,
What use are the many or the few?

**“In Response to Wu Chuanzheng, Vice Censor-in-Chief, Two Poems”**
*Also sent to Wang Shisan of Gaoyang*

Within Luoyang’s walls, a foolish old man,
For over a decade, I have not read books.
In old age, my feelings are hard to describe—
Pale mist and cold moon illuminate sparse pines.

Delighting in stillness, am I free of illness?
Loving leisure, my heart remains.
How could I compare to those self-content,
Who drift with the world’s ebb and flow?

**“Right and Wrong Chant”**
To call short right and long wrong,
To favor red and despise white.
A lifetime of trivial pursuits,
Never free from love and hate.
If love and hate do not depart,
How can right and wrong be settled?
Once love and hate are gone,
What use are right and wrong?

**“Purifying the Heart Chant”**
Many seek to purify the body,
Few seek to purify the heart.
Purifying the body washes away dust and grime,
Purifying the heart washes away depravity and excess.
Dust and grime are cleansed with water,
But depravity cannot be rinsed away.
To truly cleanse the heart’s filth,
One must pluck the stringless zither.

**“On Seeing Things Chant”**
Seeing things, I sing and chant,
Never needing deliberate intent.
Leisurely composing poems of bamboo baskets,
Quietly observing the world’s affairs.

**“Toiling the Fields Chant”**
In spring, plow and sow,
In summer, weed and hoe,
In autumn, harvest and prepare,
In winter, use and store.
When rain and dew are timely,
Shoots sprout and ears form.
But if flood or drought strike,
One still bears the blame.

**“Sixty-Six Years Chant”**
At sixty-six years,
Joyfully holding my wine cup.
In youth, no grand ambitions,
In old age, this open heart.
Often my heroic spirit stirs,
From time to time, fine verses come.
I have gathered three hundred poems,
And deem them equal to jade treasures.

**“Lenience and Severity Chant”**
Lenience makes the people lax,
Severity makes the people suffer.
Lenience and severity in balance,
The people find their own peace.

**“Minor Arts Chant”**
Though arts may be minor,
Their effects can strike deep.
If one does not delve into subtleties,
How can one attain the divine?

**“Gain and Loss Chant”**
People differ in worth,
Affairs vary in scale.
Gains are not easily won,
Losses come all too readily.

**“Fumigation and Study Chant”**
Between good and evil,
Fumigation still reveals traces.
Draw near to fragrance, and you will be fragrant;
Draw near to stench, and you will stink.

**“Love and Hate Chant”**
To hate death and love life,
To shun harm and seek benefit—
Such are the feelings of all under heaven,
No different in any.

**“Year’s End Chant”**
This feeling others do not know,
Yet I often sigh at the fading year.
Though I sigh at the fading year,
What can I do? It is hard to entrust.
This feeling others do not know,
Yet I often sigh at the long passage of time.
Though I sigh at the long passage,
What can I do? Others do not receive it.

**“Contentment Chant”**
Lightly gained, easily lost,
Much scheming, little achieved.
Virtue has no end to its benefits,
Goodness seeks no near fame.

**“Following Others Chant”**
To follow others and lose,
Is to treat their words as guests.
From now on,
How can I trust others again?

**“Poetry and Painting Chant”**
The painter’s brush excels at depicting things,
Skilled in wielding red and green.
Red and green enter subtle thought,
And ten thousand things reveal no hidden form.
Poetry and prose excel at depicting things,
Skilled in wielding sincere intent.
Sincere intent enters fine verses,
And ten thousand things reveal no hidden feelings.

Poetry is the will of man,
Speech is the voice of the heart.
Will is expressed through words,
Voice is shaped by rhythm.
To know many birds and beasts,
Is it only their feathers and quills?
To know many grasses and trees,
Is it only their branches and stems?
Without the *Feng*, *Ya*, and *Song*,
How could one know merit and fame?
Without the *Ze*, *Bi*, and *Xing*,
How could one know rise and fall?
Beholding the court’s grand affairs,
The majesty of the altars of soil and grain.
There were Tang and Wu’s foundations,
No You or Li’s songs of decline.
Knowing the difficulty of achievement,
How could one lose it through arrogance?
Banish great vermin and treachery,
Advance rare worthies and talents.
Gather the essence of yin and yang,
Seek the spirit of heaven and earth.
Draw from rivers and mountains’ purity,
Raise the glory of sun and moon.
Gather these as the people’s ultimate,
Inscribe them as the nation’s canon.
Broadcast them on metal and stone,
Perform them in the grand court.
Move the hearts of the people,
Inform the spirits and gods.
When people and spirits are both pleased,
This is what is called harmonious broth.
Since there were Yu Shun’s songs,
How could there be no Gao Yao’s responses?
Since there was Confucius’ editing,
How could there be no Ji Zha’s listening?
If one wishes to bring joy to all under heaven,
Without poetry, what else could suffice?
With the remnants of my learning,
Great peace may yet be achieved.

**“Poetry as History Chant”**
The historian’s brush excels at recording events,
Skilled in displaying its prose.
When prose prevails, truth is lost,
And all that remains are empty words.
Poetry as history excels at recording events,
Skilled in crafting their truth.
When truth prevails, ornament fades,
Not like the chaos of mere appearances.

The world is not one affair,
The world is not one man.
The world is not one thing,
The world is not one body.
In the eras of emperors and kings,
Their people endure as if ever-present.
For a hundred thousand myriad years,
Their deeds remain ever-new.
They can discern the myriad policies,
They can order the common people.
They can recount the ancestors,
They can instruct the descendants.
They can honor the Son of Heaven,
They can discipline the three armies.
They can advance remonstrance,
They can extol meritorious deeds.
They can transform customs,
They can deepen human relations.
They can beautify education,
They can harmonize the distant and the near.
They can rectify husband and wife,
They can clarify ruler and minister.
They can praise Heaven and Earth,
They can move ghosts and spirits.
How earnestly they admonish others,
How earnestly they instruct others.
How reluctantly they part from others,
How sincerely they bestow upon others.
No year lacks its fine festivals,
No month lacks its fine days.
No time lacks its fine scenes,
No day lacks its fine guests.
In the goblet there is fine wine,
At the seat there is no ominous vapor.
In the breast there are fine things,
In the heart there is no dust.
How can one bear not to wield the great brush,
Writing characters as large as cartwheels?
Over three thousand poems,
Spread as spring throughout the world.

**“Elaboration Chant”**
All affairs enter deep contemplation,
Their flavor grows ever deeper.
Though they once passed before the eyes,
They must be pondered in the heart.
Passing by, one has not fully seen;
Pondering, one is willing to seek thoroughly.
Only by thorough seeking can one see,
And only then is it true gold.
What is true gold?
True gold sinks into the bones.
Having endured forging and tempering,
It is worthy and needs no contemplation.
Once in hand, what need is there for eyes?
In conduct, how dare one be careless?
Carefree only after being at ease,
In the world there are those who understand.
What are those who understand?
Those who understand reside only in the heart.
The liver and spleen show no effect,
In bells and drums, one searches in vain.
If one can already disclose things,
What need is there to further play the zither?
The phoenix’s arrival is not for itself,
It is only to deeply move others.
What is the phoenix’s arrival?
The phoenix’s arrival bears no low intent.
With bodies all joyful,
Without things not harmonious.
If a state were like one thing,
The four directions would be like limbs.
How majestic were Yao and Shun,
How could they be named?

**“History and Painting Chant”**
The historian’s brush excels at recording events,
The painter’s brush excels at depicting things.
Depicting things and recording events,
Each excels in one.
Poetry as history excels at recording intent,
Poetry and painting excel at depicting emotion.
Depicting emotion and recording intent,
Both can be precise.
Depicting emotion does not depict things,
Recording intent does not record events.
Form and appearance emerge from creation,
Imagination completes Heaven and Earth.
Substance and function thus divide,
Even ghosts and spirits dare not differ.
What is poetry if not this?
It is history and painting combined.

**“Competition Chant”**
People have no love of competition,
Affairs have no excess of seeking.
Competition brings much humiliation,
Excessive seeking brings much sorrow.
Sorrow and humiliation arrive together,
And virtue does not wander.
Not only does it harm others,
It also becomes the body’s enemy.

**“Governing the Heart Chant”**
The heart is closer than the body,
The body is closer than others.
If one cannot govern the heart,
How can one govern the body?
If one cannot govern the body,
How can one govern others?

**“My Hut Chant”**
I too love my hut,
My hut resembles a rustic dwelling.
My nature follows the Dao, shared with the heavens,
My body is distant from the world.
Everywhere, fragrant grasses grow,
On my bed, disordered books pile.
Since there have been no affairs,
I no longer apply effort.

**“Human Spirit Chant”**
Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things,
Among them, humans are the most spiritually endowed.
Having the spirit of humanity,
One must also have human emotions.
Without human emotions,
One merely has the form of a human.

**“Passing By Chant”**
Do not be startled by things passing by in profusion,
As gains and losses grind against each other, never settling.
Though skills may be many, they have no real effect,
And when cleverness reaches its peak, it is but an empty name.
The warmth, coolness, cold, and heat of the four seasons,
The sweet, bitter, pungent, and sour of the myriad things.
Apart from this heart, all are external things,
Yet even this heart may not be fully awakened.

**“Disaster Chant”**
Disaster from without
Can still be dispelled.
Disaster from within,
How can it be withstood?
Between Heaven and humanity,
Examine both within and without.

**“Within and Without Chant”**
Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth,
Are humanity’s doors and windows.
Heart, gall, spleen, and kidneys,
Are humanity’s inner currents.
If one can guard within,
Without will not be received.
If within there is no guard,
How can without endure?

**“Fame and Profit Chant”**
Weighing heavily with fame
Reveals others’ emotions.
Enriching with profit
Reveals others’ intentions.
Emotions and intentions are within,
If within is weighty, without is light.
Fame and profit are without,
If within is base, without is noble.

**“Name and Reality Chant”**
Within, there is no reality,
Without, there is a name—
The petty person thus boasts.
Without, there is no name,
Within, there is reality—
What does the noble person lose?

**“Nature and Emotion Chant”**
The noble person follows nature,
The petty person follows emotion.
Following nature, one draws near,
Following emotion, one drifts far.

**“Exhortation Chant”**
People should not be negligent,
Affairs value earnestness.
Negligence approaches shallowness,
Earnestness approaches sincerity.

**“Doubt and Trust Chant”**
People should not be credulous,
Affairs should not be doubted excessively.
Credulity invites provocation,
Excessive doubt invites separation.

**“Order and Chaos Chant”**
Noble persons and petty persons
Often stand in equal measure.
Sometimes they halt, sometimes they act,
Now in order, now in chaos.

**“Timeliness Chant”**
The dragon does not leap in winter,
The firefly can fly at night.
Petty persons and noble persons,
All have their time.

**“Loyalty and Thickness Chant”**
The petty person is momentary,
The noble person endures.
Momentary, they incline toward perversity,
Enduring, they remain loyal and sincere.

**“Deep Winter Chant”**
The twelfth month draws to a close,
And one is startled that the year’s rhythm is exhausted.
Ice is stored in the northern lands,
The thaw has not yet come with the east wind.
In the dimness, one vainly seeks green,
On the flower branches, one forces a search for red.
Seeking spring, spring is not seen,
It is only within the breast.

**“Knowing Wrong Chant”**
All that came before today,
Knowing wrong, the heart can rely on.
Empty words are not worth speaking,
True conduct—what need for pride?
There is no medicine for aging,
But there is poetry to praise sagely brightness.
Though one may drink at times,
One need not imitate Liu Ling.

**“Winter Solstice Chant”**
At the winter solstice, midnight’s midpoint,
The heart of Heaven does not change or shift.
Where the first yang arises,
Before the myriad things are born.
The flavor of dark wine is just mild,
The sound of the great tone is truly rare.

If you doubt these words, ask Fuxi again.

**"White-Haired Chant"**
White-haired for many years now,
How much longer can these whiskers hang?
Yet I count myself fortunate still—
This decline is not yet complete.
Though my house lacks silver,
I have sons to carry on the line.
Dare I call poverty pure?
Few like me can claim the same.

**"On Poetry Chant"**
Poetry is the heart of man,
Without verse, the heart cannot be known.
When people harmonize, their minds are fully seen,
When Heaven grants, intent is linked.
Discussing things gives rise to fresh lines,
Judging texts refines elegant speech.
When inspiration comes, it is as if preordained,
No need for carving or chiseling.

**"Water and Cord Chant"**
Water can be level but not straight,
A cord can be straight but not level.
If only human nature were like water and cord,
The world would know no strife.

**"Punishment and Name Chant"**
The noble man seeks renown,
The petty man courts punishment.
Good and evil differ in kind,
Yet both arise from following desire.

**"Yin and Yang Chant"**
Yang moves as one, yin moves as two,
One governs Heaven, two govern Earth.
Heaven moves in sixes, Earth in fours;
Four governs form, six governs qi.

**"Human Affairs Chant"**
People come and go,
Affairs rise and fall;
Traces may be sparse or dense,
But people make no comparisons.
Master these four truths,
And you shall endure.

**"Inner and Outer Chant"**
Neat attire and dignified bearing—
This is outer cultivation.
Pure conduct and righteousness—
This is inner cultivation.
Cultivate both inner and outer,
And who would not seek you?
Disheveled dress and slovenly manner—
This is outer neglect.
Lacking righteousness in conduct—
This is inner neglect.
Neglect both inner and outer,
And who would not spurn you?

**"Rise and Fall Chant"**
Worthy descendants
Revive the family name.
Unworthy descendants
Ruin the family name.
Alas, descendants—
The root of rise and fall.

**"Life and Death Chant"**
To study immortality is to seek not to die,
To study Buddhism is to seek rebirth.
Rebirth or not dying—
Can man truly achieve either?
If man could truly achieve them,
Only then would it enter the realm of feeling.
How fortunate the recluse,
Unpitied by the world.
How lamentable the lord and minister,
Deeply deluded by the world.

**"Birthday Chant"**
Thirty-five thousand days—
This body is my allotment.
Once but a thing of the moment,
Now at last a man.
Long indebted to the power of yin and yang,
Ever owing the kindness of father and mother.
Raise a cup of birthday wine,
With children and grandchildren gathered in the grove.

**"Timely Matters Chant"**
When the time comes,
Its momentum may be seized.
When the time departs,
Its affairs arise anew.
What was done yesterday
Cannot be done today.
What is done today
Will surely change later.
Time prolonged breeds trouble,
Affairs prolonged breed corruption.
Corruption and trouble follow one another—
How can man find peace?

**"Ignorance Chant"**
Ignorant of yin and yang,
Ignorant of Heaven and Earth,
Ignorant of human nature,
Ignorant of the principles of things.
Presuming to teach others—
Would one not feel shame?

**"Water and Fire Chant"**
When water and fire are mastered,
Their union brings completion.
When water and fire are uncontrolled,
Burning and drowning come swiftly.
Not only water and fire—
All things are thus.
Knowing only how to use water and fire,
Not knowing the meaning of water and fire.

**"Central Plains Chant"**
The armies of the Central Plains
Take benevolence and righteousness as their guide.
Without benevolence and righteousness,
The four barbarians come to humiliate.
**"Joyful Drinking Chant"**
Yaofu loved to drink,
Drinking to preserve his true nature.
He did not like to become drunk,
Only to reach a gentle tipsiness.
What is the scene of gentle tipsiness?
The heart’s landscape like early spring.
What is the scene of early spring?
Heaven and Earth just beginning to stir.
Unknowing that the self is man,
Unknowing that man is the self.
Only knowing self and man,
Undivided from Heaven.

**"Feelings Chant"**
Human life has no fixed course,
Affairs take many forms.
In perilous doubt as a traveling official,
Read your family letters carefully.
Only after enduring hardship and danger
Can one truly appreciate peace and safety.
A man’s life’s work
Must be viewed when the pain has settled.

**"Action and Stillness Chant"**
When the time is to stop, stop;
When the time is to act, act.
Whether to act or stop,
Do not force it with human effort.

**"Times of Peace Chant"**
In times of peace, within gardens and pavilions,
In years of plenty, among villages and hamlets.
The flavor is hard to describe,
As wind, mist, grass, and trees all lie at ease.

**"Seeking Spring Chant"**
Grass color faintly green,
Flower tips vaguely red.
Hard to put into words—
Like intoxication in the heart.

**"Not Venturing Forth Chant"**
Winter and summer, rarely venturing out,
Only moving between southern and northern gardens.
If one encounters fine scenery,
One may yet reach the Three Heavens.
Westward two hundred paces to Heaven’s Street,
Northward three hundred paces to Heaven’s Ford,
Eastward four hundred paces to Heaven’s Palace.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Scroll Eighteen concludes.
*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Scroll Nineteen.

**Yichuan Shao Yong Yaofu**

The unvirtuous,
Endowed with impure qi,
Serpentine in disposition,
Wolfish in nature.

The truly virtuous,
Endowed with clear and luminous qi,
Golden and jadelike in nature,
Orchid and iris in disposition.

**"Different Chants"**
The noble person,
Unlike oneself,
Rejoices at goodness,
Delights in worthiness.

The petty person,
Unlike oneself,
Resents goodness,
Rages at worthiness.

**"Gain and Loss Chant"**
Time is hard to gain yet easy to lose,
Though the heart may regret, what can be retrieved?
Unaware that old age has already arrived,
Unaware that aspirations and wishes have gone astray.

**"Lament Chant"**
Lament! Time is hard to gain,
Grieve! The Dao remains untransmitted.
This year now draws to a close,
Tomorrow begins the new year.

**"Year’s End"**
Half a hundred, hair already gray,
Now even more silvery white.
Knowing myself as a scholar,
Others marvel at a divine immortal.
Wind and moon hard to forget—wine,
Clouds and mountains need no coin.
Sixty-six years now passed,
Tomorrow adds another year.

**"Inspired Writing Chant"**
*Xining tenth year*
Window bright, air warm and mild,
Wine fine, hand supple and soft.
Inspiration soars, emotions stirred,
Brush falls—spring blossoms burst forth.

**"Reflection on Shadows Chant"**
Nature resides within the body,
Shadows lie beyond the form.
Nature moves, the body follows,
Form moves, shadows gather.
If body and nature cease,
Where then are form and shadow?
Words beyond shadows—
What is there to marvel?

**"Joy and Sorrow Chant"**
Great joy and great sorrow,
Neither allows sleep.
If either could bring sleep,
What concern would not be resolved?

**"Insight Dawns Chant"**
When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
The body is wholly mine,
Growing lean, then plump again.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
To seal the Pass of Han,
A single pellet of clay suffices.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
Like wielding a treasured sword,
Cutting jade as if through mud.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
Thirst quenched by fine wine,
Illness cured by a skilled physician.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
A single word can
Resolve a century’s confusion.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
Within sentiment, the essence of things is clear,
Beyond principle, the workings of heaven revealed.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
Pitiable and contemptible,
Deserving scorn and ridicule.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments first break—
Unfit for exhortation,
Only for sighs.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are yet unbroken—
Only fit to wield the brush,
Not to hold power.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are fully broken—
Only fit for a first glance,
Not for prolonged stay.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
To know flowers in full bloom,
Leaves must first scatter.

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
With power to act,
What need for further cunning?

When the principles of things dawn,
When human sentiments are laid bare—
Dare one speak of worldly affairs?
Once in hand, what could be difficult?

**"Joyful Drinking Chant"**
All my life, I’ve loved to drink,
Loving light and mellow wine.
I dislike deep intoxication,
Only a gentle warmth suffices.
Harmonious as a second youth,
Gentle as early spring.
Yet this is hard to describe—
The Two Modes remain undivided.

**"Nobility and Baseness Chant"**
What strikes me,
I can act upon with strength.
What binds me to others,
Is hard to contend with force.
Noble as the lord of ten thousand chariots,
Yet never proud.
Base as a commoner,
Yet never oppressed.

**"Placement Chant"**
In times of uncertainty,
In difficult circumstances,
Amid peril and doubt,
Observe how others act.

**"Exertion Chant"**
Matters great or small,
People gain or lose.
Gain comes from care,
Loss from exertion.

**"Not Aging Chant"**
No one escapes aging,
Yet the sun may reach its zenith twice.
To not age is impossible,
But a second zenith may yet come.

**"Letter in Place of Writing to Zhen Zhang, Garrison Field Officer"**
Twenty springs have passed since we parted,
Suddenly your letter arrives—how earnest!
Are there not worthy men in all directions?
Yet a thousand *li* away, I still think of old friends.
Having seen much of the world, I know what to accept or reject,
Long familiar with human nature, I discern closeness and distance.
Now I grow old, content in decline,
Offering no aid to this bright age, I recline by the Luo’s banks.

**"Long and Short Chant"**
The noble person delights in sincerity,
The petty person delights in deception.
Sincerity endures through the years,
Deception fades with the days and months.

**"Delusion and Awakening Chant"**
The noble person corrects faults,
The petty person conceals wrongs.
Correcting faults leads to awakening,
Concealing wrongs leads to delusion.
Awakening brings fortune,
Delusion invites disaster.

**"Rectifying Nature Chant"**
Before birth,
One knows not how it is.
After birth,
One knows there is heaven.
Having come from heaven,
Nature is rectified in all things.
The noble person fulfills their form,
The petty person trifles with life.

**"Light and Darkness Chant"**
Light has sun and moon,
Darkness has ghosts and spirits.
Sun and moon illuminate things,
Ghosts and spirits depend on people.
Light is revealed through things,
Darkness is declared by people.
If people and things do not act,
How can light and darkness be distinguished?

**"No Shame Chant"**
Having witnessed events,
Having tempered things—
Between heaven and earth,
I move without shame.

**"Affairs Chant"**
Speech must be measured,
Principle values what is fitting.
What can be changed should be reconsidered thrice,
What must be done should be pondered again.

**"Self and Others Chant"**
Born after heaven and earth,
The heart exists before them.
Heaven and earth emerge from me—
What more is there to say?

**"Four Permissible Things Chant"**
What can be striven for: conduct,
What can be trusted: words,
What can be entrusted: fate,
What can be relied upon: heaven.

**"Four Impermissible Things Chant"**
Words must not be reckless,
Conduct must not falter,
Fate must not be neglected,
Heaven must not be defied.

**"Renting a House Chant"**
A new house brings joy to its dwellers,
A dilapidated one makes them wish to leave.
If the master keeps it well-maintained,
What time is not fit to live?

**"The Petty Person"**
The petty person has no shame,
Values profit, scorns death,
Fears no human punishment,
Cares not for others’ judgment.

**"Reflection"**
Their bones are bright,
Their spirit clear,
Their blessings meager,
Their fortune light.

**"Illness"**
The body is like a kingdom,
When ill, one must seek a physician.

*Yichuan Jirang Ji*, Scroll Nineteen concludes.

**"Recovery"**
When illness fades, medicine finds its rightful place,
Moderation and release bring proper harmony.

**"Second Month Chant"**
Beneath the trees, no other knowledge remains,
Only the appointed time of the second month.
Wine is tasted when newly brewed,
Flowers are admired at half-bloom.
There is only the joy of intoxication,
No sorrow of reckless abandon.
Who can preserve this scene,
And store it forever in heart and spleen?

**"Third Month Chant"**
All day through the city, spring’s departure is pursued,
Yet those who chase it know its numbered days.
Does the true Master ever fail to bring forth life?
Yet wanderers have no certainty to rely upon.
Pear blossoms, drenched in rain, dissolve into weeping,
Willow fluff, stirred by wind, refuses to settle.
A moment of clarity holds boundless good intent—
Alas, such intent is hard to bestow.

**"First-Rank Chant"**
To utter words of the first rank,
One must possess a mind of the first rank.
To become a person of the first rank,
One must perform deeds of the first rank.

**"All Things Chant"**
Success and failure must be left to fate,
Rise and decline each have their season.
Though petty men indulge in endless desire,
How could the true Master permit partiality?
This fleeting joy,
Soon turns to hollow sorrow.
Behold: when spring departs,
For whom do the wanderers roam?

**"Luoyang Spring Chant"**
No place in the four directions rivals Luoyang’s beauty,
No season in the year surpasses spring’s blossoms.
In beauty and bloom lies exquisite subtlety—
Yet who but the idle can receive such grace?
Luoyang’s people are accustomed to rare blossoms,
Peach and plum flowers scarcely count as flowers.
Only when the peonies burst into full glory
Does the entire city rejoice without end.

Peach and plum flowers bloom, yet none pause to gaze—
Their season is but a prelude to the peony’s hour.
When peonies bloom, wine’s price soars,
And midnight finds revelers still abroad.
Time refuses even a moment’s respite:
Ninety days of spring vanish once more.
How many fallen petals drift without refuge,
Half carried by streams, half swept by wind?

Spring departs, flowers fade, the days grow long,
Swallows chatter, orioles sing, each absorbed in their own haste.
Why do wanderers cease their comings and goings?
The green shade is no less rich than the red bloom.
Ten days, and the finest flowers are gone—
Pity the Green Emperor’s laborious craft.
Wanderers, do not despair of certainty:
The red bloom may not surpass the green.

Where, after all, does spring retreat?
Countless spring grievances remain unvoiced.
I would entrust the warbler to ask the reason,
But the cuckoo only cries, *"Better to leave!"*

The four seasons complete a year’s cycle,
Yet only spring reveals such splendid blossoms.
Ten thousand coins for wine are no extravagance—
Once the red bloom fades, will it ever return?

**"Self-Admonition"**
At sixty-seven years,
I live as a man of this world.
From a land of central uprightness,
My body contains all things.
Beyond heaven, no greater joy exists,
Within my breast, another spring abides.

**"Falling Flowers Chant"**
Ten thousand purples, a thousand reds—everywhere they fly,
A riverbank of peach and plum blossoms forms a careless path.
As fierce wind and torrential rain approach dusk,
The dancing pavilions and singing terraces grow sparse.
Floating on water, how can they find stability?
Scattered along the wayside, they have no refuge.
The warbler need not speak many words—
With each passing moment, spring has already gone.

**"Late Spring Chant"**
Flowers bloom—spring is at its finest,
Flowers fade—spring draws to a close.
Who would have thought the cuckoo,
Still able to cry, *"Return!"*

Spring arrives, butterflies flutter in chaos,
Spring departs, the cuckoo weeps.
How can it be as before,
When the warm breeze first stirred?

Birds do not comprehend human feeling,
They only know spring is ending.
Sometimes they call *"Pour the wine!"*
Sometimes they cry *"Go home!"*

**"Coin Chant"**
Called "spring and cloth," yet footless, they traverse the world.
Difficult to speak of their virtuous issuance,
They can open faces that never smile.
They repay the small debt of a life extended,
They relieve urgent needs like the great elixir.
Only the old men of Shang Mountain,
Cannot be bought with them—leisure.

**"Peony Chant"**
One hue, one fragrance—yet the fragrance is celestial,
The color unlike all others.
The true Master’s craftsmanship is exquisite—
Not something human intent can fathom.

**"In Memory of Academician Zhang Zihou of Fengxiang"**
Half the realm of Qin’s mountains and rivers,
Nurturing genius through the ages.
How many worthies have graced the past?
What era has lacked men to revive its pure wind?

**"Self-Conduct Chant"**
How does Yaofu conduct himself?
The entire city of Luoyang feels like home.
Having no virtue to set myself apart,
I follow things with utmost sincerity—nothing more.
Before my eyes, I see only the web of heaven’s offices,
Who notices the changing years above my head?
Not only does spring come and go—
Within my breast, the four seasons’ flowers always bloom.

**"Being Human Chant"**
To be human, one must join the human throng;
Without joining, one cannot fulfill humanity.
Great Shun differed not from others,
Even Emperor Yao’s kin followed proper order.
A heart at odds brings illness to the body,
Harmony in affairs brings spring to the four seas.
The heart governs the four limbs—it is the master,
Yet the limbs are even farther from the self.

**"Primordial Chant"**
Who undertakes the work of the Primordial?
How does one speak of it, and to whom?
If the Primordial can be spoken of,
What lies beyond ruler and subject, father and son?
The tricks before our eyes are plain to all,
The work within the heart is unknown to the world.
Heaven, earth, and self are but shifts in position—
This body differs not from Fu Xi’s.

**"Central Harmony Chant"**
Nature has no other secret—
One must recognize central harmony.
Few words in the heart,
Many affairs in the world.
Like timely rain ending a long drought,
Like medicine reviving one from deep illness.
If one thing remains unresolved,
How can one manage the ten thousand things?

**"Four Worthies Chant"**
Yanguo’s words unfold in rich detail,
Huishu’s words are concise and apt,
Junshi’s words flow with ease,
Bochun’s words are both measured and stirring.
The four worthies of Luoyang’s gaze,
Stood above all others.
In the Xining era of the Great Song,
They were the splendor of their time.

**"Old Age Chant"**
The passing years no longer startle my head,
Only my friends’ eyes grow clearer.
Bright moon often viewed from my seat,
Deep wine not poured for sorrow.
If my heart lacks foresight,
I remain but a youth in the world.
Whom shall I invite as companion?
A light boat drifting on rivers and lakes.

**"Heaven and Earth Chant"**
Between heaven and humanity, how can a needle’s point intrude?
Why seek distant truths when the highest principle is near?
When baleful flames rage, they burn all the fiercer,
Where grace flows, it soaks all the deeper.

**"Long March Chant"**
The long-marching soldier yearns for home,
The parched people long for rain like thirsting souls.
Fortune and misfortune turn as swiftly as a palm’s flip—
Could one lie awake at midnight without a sigh?

**"On the Highest Principle"**
Among the myriad things, humans are called most precious,
Yet sages rise above the people like stars apart.
A steadfast stone needs no doubt to endure the day,
But to know the subtle signs before harm—how few are so divine!
Without resolve and courage, good cannot be achieved;
With keen discernment, purity is still more prized.
Fortune and misfortune show their signs by gradual steps—
Not by heaven or earth, but by human hands alone.

**"Ode to Human Jade"**
Jade does not value itself—people value it;
Yet why should human worth yield to jade’s purity?
So flawless and fair, ever constant and true,
Its inner light and outer gleam both reveal its essence.
Though fame may first lie hidden in the stone,
Only human hands can carve it into treasure.
The ancients are gone and cannot be seen again,
Yet the words of the humble-robed sage were not amiss.

**"On Deceit"**
The deceitful distrust all others,
For the world runs on deceit.
If one trusts no one in the world,
Then no truth remains in speech.

**"Drinking Wine"**
Now and then, a sip of fine wine,
Nurturing heaven’s harmony in place of tea.
Without rain, the year turns to dire famine,
And the city’s burden holds no prosperous life.
Dwelling in fields, one must still care for the realm;
Entrusting affairs to kin, one must still tend the home.
If asked what progress age has brought,
I see only silver added to my temples in the mirror.

**"On the Joy of Things"**
Things have sound, color, scent, and taste;
Humans have ears, eyes, mouth, and nose.
All the world’s things reside within one body—
Look inward, and nothing is lacking.

**"Five Poems on Wang Anzhi’s Small Garden"**

**The Small Garden**
The small garden, newly repaired, stays close to home,
Rising to the hill’s crest, descending to the moat.
Luoyang’s land seems favored beyond compare,
And Tianjin’s visitors arrive without delay.
It may rival Penglai’s immortal gardens,
But let it not vie with Peach Blossom Spring’s praise.
I hear a pavilion here grows many herbs—
Yet still lacks the famed *zǐhèchē*.

**The Wild Pavilion**
A pavilion named "Wild," far from the dusty world,
Where Song and Shaos’ misty peaks send gentle winds.
Days and months, years and seasons—all belong to me;
Where else could one seek the realm within the gourd?

**The Humble Pavilion**
Xu You’s plan was not so profound—
Washing his ears was not as good as stilling his heart.
Here, one feels as if beyond the world,
Where no affairs intrude.

**The Medicinal Pavilion**
Mountain herbs, though many, few can name;
The master transplants them and marks each one.
If they can truly cure the world’s ills,
Why shun the red and purple blooms near the eaves?

**The Evening Glow Pavilion**
The high pavilion, newly built, brushes the clouds and mist—
How fine that it can hold the fading light!
Near the path where spring admirers come and go,
Who now lingers here among the wanderers?

**"Observing Things"**
Water brings rain, fire brings dew,
Earth brings mist, stone brings hail.
Water’s wind is cool, fire’s wind is hot,
Earth’s wind is mild, stone’s wind is sharp.
Water’s clouds are black, fire’s clouds are red,
Earth’s clouds are yellow, stone’s clouds are white.
Water’s thunder rumbles, fire’s thunder crackles,
Earth’s thunder rolls, stone’s thunder crashes.

**"Painting Sleep"**
Daytime slumber is no easy art,
Fitting even for the age of Fuxi.
With a heart free of care after a full meal,
One may stroll at leisure, wrapped in quiet.
Before noon, orioles trill among the courtyard boughs;
By dusk, few visitors tread the flower-lined path.
Behold the world’s many troubled souls—
Though their pillows and mats may be cool, they lack this peace.

**"On Advancing and Retreating"**
Advance and retreat—both paths are called guests;
Why trouble the seat with endless debate?
Lower your brows when seated, attending to all;
Swing your arms when walking, heedless of others.
Teeth and hair now decline, no longer youth’s days,
Yet in forests and streams, age brings eternal spring.
Does anyone know the one who acts without care?
For how could favor or disgrace ever reach such a person?

**"As a Guest"**
Suddenly I recall my days as a guest in southern Qin,
Gazing east from Luoyang, blocked by the Qin plains.
Clouds and mountains lie two thousand *li* away,
Nineteen years have passed since then.
Willow hues—are they not newly graceful?
River sounds—do they not still murmur as before?
If this frail body could return once more,
How could the feelings of old not fade into the distant past?

Suddenly I recall my days as a guest in eastern Wu,
Where my youthful heart first saw the land of water and clouds.
Island barbarians dwelt near the wild frontiers,
Tides brought merchants mingling with the sea trade.
Lying down, I watched the vast ocean encircle the earth;
Sitting, I saw the red sun rise from Fusang.
Vain births, vain deaths—how many there are!
Yet the name of "true man" is not easily borne.

Suddenly I recall my days as a guest in eastern Wu,
When my spirit soared, delighting in travel.
Climbing mountains, I never paused lightly,
And never easily ceased with leftover wine.
A thousand lotus stems perfumed the Chu plains,
A soft wind filled the sail past Yangzhou.
Looking back, it was like the dream of Handan—
In an instant, thirty autumns have passed.

Suddenly I recall my days as a guest in Taiyuan,
Where autumn passed in drinking, yet I did not return.
Distant mountains, nearby waters—all turned to sorrow,
High towers in slanting sunlight—all became grief.
Youth could not endure the sight of flowers,
And with too much feeling, tears only stained my robes.
Now, old in Luoyang’s walls,
I no longer bear such sorrow in my brows.

**"Nurturing Life"**
Grasp firmly like an infant,
Breathe strongly like a warrior.
Neither comes naturally—
Both require great effort.
The heart is the body’s master,
The will is the *qi*’s commander.
Sink the pearl into the deep abyss,
Nurture your own heaven and earth.

**"Illness"**
Yaofu was ill for three months,
Worrying the people of Luoyang.
Not just friends’ concern,
But as if for kin.
Recommending doctors with earnest hearts,
Seeking medicine with deep care.
How can I repay such kindness as before,
Visiting their doors to express my thanks?

**"Severe Illness"**
Fifty years of peace and joy,
Then suddenly struck by grave illness.
Still in the height of summer,
I lay abed for hundreds of days.
Acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicines—
A hundred treatments, yet none took effect.
I entrust my fate to heaven,
What loss is there in my heart?

**"Heaven and Humanity"**
Heaven gives this body, entrusted to human effort;
When human effort is exhausted, heaven’s decree arrives.
Heaven and humanity are not a hair’s breadth apart—
If even a hair’s breadth exists, they become two.

**"At Death’s Door"**
With fate, even in peril one does not die;
Without fate, even the best medicine is useless.
Only entrust one’s fate to heaven—
Beyond that, who can idly calculate?

**"Entrusting to Heaven"**
Heaven gives me life,
Heaven takes me in death.
I entrust all to heaven—
What is there that cannot be?

**"Obtaining the One"**
Heaven naturally obtains the One—there is no "after";
I obtain the One only after it comes from Heaven.
Only Heaven and the One are without duality—
How could I ever differ from Heaven?

**"Answering a Guest’s Inquiry About My Illness"**
The world values gold above all,
Yet I alone delight in poetry.
Life and death are one and the same,
While profit and harm idly pursue each other.
Decoctions and remedies are not without effect,
But my illness has already settled deep in the vital organs.
Still, I endure the burning moxa,
To comfort the hearts of friends.

**"On My Deathbed"**
Born in an age of peace,
Grown in an age of peace,
Aged in an age of peace,
To die in an age of peace.
A guest asks my age—
Sixty-seven years.
Looking up and down between heaven and earth,
I am vast and without shame.

**Shaoyong’s "One Hundred Thirty-Five Closing Poems"**

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
I see the rise of sages and worthies in their time.
Sun, moon, and stars—Yao understood them;
Rivers and streams—Yu tamed them.
Kings and emperors were praised or censured,
Yet snow, moon, wind, and flowers remain unranked.
Not that the ancients lacked a perfect canon—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
I sit and watch the hours in my Peaceful Nest.
The primal qi revolves without the slightest pause,
The Two Modes shelter and cover without partiality.
The four seasons take turns as host,
While the hundred things renew and vie in marvels.
Having enjoyed so much domestic joy,
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
I am content in my Peaceful Nest.
My aspirations fulfilled, I need not seek fame,
For when a book is written, readers will come.
Forests and streams serve as heart’s delight,
Wind and moon suffice as hand’s resources.
How much broad and level land lies before me—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Half-drunk in my Peaceful Nest.
Inspired by moon and flowers, I chant verses,
Drafting letters and missives in their stead.
In the pond, a pair of fish leaps;
In the sky, how could there be no lone wild goose?
Countless friends reside in the south and north—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I find it lovable.
A precious mirror shapes the form but cannot touch the hair,
A phoenix knife meets the blade without leaving a thread.
If wind and dust do not invade the path,
How could dust ever settle on one’s robes?
To speak of sincerity and enlightenment is no easy task—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
I see the waxing and waning of all things in their time.
Heaven and earth’s full work must be revealed,
The court’s great beauty lies in its deeds.
If all remained silent, how could it be seen?
If none spoke, how could it be known?
Matters lie before us, yet people do not ponder—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I cannot sleep.
To savor orchid’s fragrance, one must have a master;
To expand the wind and elegance, for whom is it done?
Three thousand poems gather the bright moon,
Twenty-odd years twist my white beard.
Having fulfilled so many idle duties—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry reaches its end when words are forgotten.
Though words convey the essential mystery,
One must perceive the subtle in things.
Soup is known as bland only when unseasoned,
Music is recognized as rare only when soundless.
How much wind and flowers await revision—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Though old, my spirit is not yet spent.
I have claimed the leisure of water and bamboo,
And also possess the wealth of orioles and flowers.
The moon of the parasol tree shines into my bosom,
The wind from the willows blows upon my face.
With so much idle luxury surrounding me—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I stand by the Heavenly Ford.
The sound of water, intentional, endures through ages,
The color of mountains, indifferent, surrounds on all sides.
A lone goose vanishes into the distant mist,
A pair of egrets slants through the forbidden willows.
Scenery need not hinder my ease—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I linger again by the Heavenly Ford.
Lush orioles and flowers offer their beauty,
The wind and moon of Shangyang inspire novelty.
Phoenix towers and pavilions are seen amid clouds,
The gardens of virtue and Dao are glimpsed from my pillow.
I do not waste this age of peace with idle verses—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I grow old.
I observe the world through the lens of wind and elegance,
Yet through words, heaven’s secrets slip.
Few carriages and horses reach the grove,
Cups and goblets beyond the dust do not fly in vain.
A man of sixty-one years, free of cares—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I embody loyalty and forbearance.
The myriad things’ nature is seen in idleness,
The properties of all medicines are known in illness.
To be blind to success ensures failure,
To fail in knowing others invites deceit.
Family, state, and self are of one body—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I silently perceive.
At first, with intention, like father and son,
Yet in the end, without feeling, like barbarians.
Success and failure before one’s eyes remain unseen,
How can one know the peace or peril of the world?
Only now do I believe knowing others is difficult—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I recognize my fortune.
Before the sun rises, I pay homage to the Lord on High,
At the first breath of spring, I visit Fuxi.
Three cups, five cups—I urge myself to drink,
One game, two games—I play chess without contention.
What the music of *Shao* and *Hu* must be like—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I exhort myself.
Attaining the Dao depends entirely on studying with a teacher,
Transcending the dust requires inborn celestial endowment.
I fear only recognizing worthies too late,
I worry only about seeing goodness too slowly.
Thanks to friends who constantly instruct me—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
Poetry is when I am content.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
When most elated, I rise to dance,
At the stroke of my brush, words take flight.
The Peng soars ten thousand miles o’er the southern sea at first lift,
The crane returns to the distant shore after a thousand years’ flight.
Yet poetry is not merely this—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I sigh in wonder.
Fate is fixed, yet I refuse to believe in rigidity;
If there were no heaven, could falsehood truly deceive?
Talent is but a tool of cleverness,
Nobility bends to profit and harm.
Helpless, I watch spring age once more—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when my brush runs wild.
The azure sea’s gods hunt whales and leviathans,
The sunken land, devoid of water, hides dragons and serpents.
Mount Hua soars five thousand *ren* in towering splendor,
The Yellow River’s expanse stretches a hundred thousand *qing*.
All this I gather into my verses—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I come and go.
Early spring’s warmth lingers as the sun tarries,
Early autumn’s chill arrives with clouds soft and faint.
A gentle breeze stirs the drooping willows,
A fine rain passes over lush grass.
My light carriage lingers in the grove, unreturned—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I test my inkstone.
Jade, uncarved, still bears its raw discernment;
Gold, once refined, leaves no room for doubt.
Once, all mocked my careless stride—
Now, who does not shake their head in knowing?
Beyond the heavens, the phoenix flies where none may follow—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I try my brush.
Life and death are settled in their course,
And all else—honor, disgrace—may be known thereby.
At home, I act as one at home;
By the water’s edge, I speak as one by the water.
This spares both mind and effort—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I test my ink.
In a town of ten households, trust must exist;

Too much thought breeds hesitation and shame.
Miss the moment, and it cannot be reclaimed—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I speak of the Dao.
Heaven’s ear, though high, hears but a whisper;

Even with ink and brush, it defies depiction—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I speak of things.
Things wax and wane with the seasons,

Fallen blossoms on the water—where to pursue?
All are but the common affairs of the world—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I speak of events.

But those past cannot be altered before one’s eyes.
Power waxes and wanes—not in a single day—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I ascend the pavilion.
A thousand years of past affairs dissolve into mist,

Mounts Tai and Shao rise sharp as awls.
Contention has ever been but idle breath—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I recline by my desk.
Cherish every inch of time,

In no realm do I fail to find contentment—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I chant of history.

Gazing on the past, much of the present is revealed—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I face the wine.
Though I lack a single good deed in this world,

Poetry is the destination of the heart’s intent—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am middle-aged.

And my words may still jest with ease.
Sixty-two years a man of no affairs—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I laugh at myself.

The greatest achievements may come with ease.
Success and failure lie beyond all reckoning—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I yield to my servants.
They only shake their heads, saying, “Again, you err,”
Yet no sooner do they turn their feet than they do wrong.

And in their dealings, they mar all they touch.
The fault lies in knowing men—none are without flaw—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I sigh in lament.
Great vessels take time to form—one must be patient;

How could a morning bring three demotions?
To seek permanence in the ephemeral is folly—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I delight in affairs.

Good deeds endure to the end of one’s days—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I rejoice in myself.
To have one’s name among scholars in a flourishing age,

Once past, how can one chase regret?
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—

Its resolve known only to Heaven.
Poetry is where I entrust my thoughts—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I praise Confucius.
Great affairs have passed—only sighs remain;

Thus *Ding* and *Ai* abound in veiled words.
The final line—"the unicorn is caught"—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am at ease.
Where is there no fragrant grassy field?

Hold the full winecup with steady hand.
Idle vexations and hollow fame—all forgotten—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I take pride in myself.

Snowflakes drift like willow catkins.
This joy is seen only in times of peace—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I find contentment.

In brushing past human feelings, use few words.
The lingering flavor is best savored slowly—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I sit in silence.
Heaven’s intent grants leisure—there must be meaning;
The human heart, once stirred, seems without knowledge.
Light mist wrinkles willow-leaf brows,
Heavy dew hangs like tears on flower branches.
I ought to resent my own wordlessness—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I gaze in twilight.
Just as flowers bloom, they wither;

But when cuckoos come, the blossoms have flown.
Spring comes, flowers bloom; spring goes, they fade—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I venture out in spring.
A scatter of raindrops, two or three,

The carriage rolls home as smoothly as a mat.
And all this in days of peace and no strife—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I enter summer.

I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I go out in autumn.

All the world’s vain worries—gone—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I rejoice in myself.
No need for hollow fame to flaunt wit,

Fair flowers—sometimes two in the hair.
Even if none marvel at my wild ways—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I speak with certainty.
To delay is to miscalculate,

The land of a hundred passes—entrusted to whom?
Too much cleverness often turns to clumsiness—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I take account.

Two hundred new themes of wind and moon.
Year’s end—time for review again—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—

Sixty-three years—a man without cares—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I praise the *Yi*.

I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I record my thoughts.
Youthful days—all like a dream,

What comes to hand—how can one not grasp it?
To wait for the Yellow River to run clear—how long must man live?
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I cherish the moment.
A thousand miles of toil—none to tell,

When roots are firm, the state is at peace—the kingly Way remains—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I imitate the ancients.

This may be called a man’s life work—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I clap my hands in joy.

I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I try my hand.
To die well is itself a kind of immortality—is not death then avoided?

Or fathom the sorrowful heart of Song Yu?
To warn the west wind against mockery—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I recall the past.

Such feelings have now all faded away—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I weigh my thoughts.
When it’s time to let go, let go,

Only regret that such words cannot be spoken—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—

I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—

Grateful for the wine left to pour myself—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I record in place of others.

If virtue is not solitary, my Way endures—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I idly observe the vegetable garden.

Taro, ginger, and yams fill the beds.
All things shine in their season—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I probe the principles of things.

Joy’s peak feels like sorrow.
Why is the world not like this?
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—

With so much fortune, I should rejoice—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I ponder deeply.

Yet leave no words for later times?
Events differ, times change—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I was young at heart.

Flowers so fine their fragrance clung to my robes.
Sixty-four years—a man of no cares—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**
I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I reflect on myself.
If there is intent, it cannot be spoken,

Rejoicing in how sages and worthies set their minds far—
I do not love to write poetry.

**"I Do Not Love to Write Poetry"**

When the blade meets, why trouble with many concerns—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I reflect in warning.
Shallow intent breeds confusion in excess,

Can the virtuous heart lack Heaven’s protection?
Reading the *Yi* not merely to foresee fortune and misfortune—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I praise the *Yi*.
The eight trigrams, though small, each have their master,
The three powers, vast and complete, leave nothing omitted.
Yin and yang’s ebb and flow never cease,
How could one not know movement and stillness, fortune and misfortune?
Witnessing the divine workings and their far-reaching effects—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I praise the *Yi*.
The great Dao is bestowed upon all, each with its meaning,

Though one may know the Dao and attain it,
It does not compare to aligning with Heaven before Heaven acts.
Beyond this, even sages do not speak—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I mark the tenth month.
The cold sun lacks light, the sky’s hue distant,

On the roads, wind and people grow sparse.
The sights before my eyes defy description—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I find delight.

The world should leave a path open—
I do not love to write poetry.

Why trouble to guard against flaws and gaps?
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I foresee.
Even in poverty, joy resides in my heart,

How much gold can buy freedom from doubt?
Though age lingers, spring has not yet faded—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I cannot bear.
Violent qi harms men, bringing illness,

Worldly affairs move only for profit,
A scholar’s integrity is known only in hardship.
To prattle on is not my way—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I resent the moon.
They say Heaven’s eternity lies somewhere—

Curved in the west, like a brow.
From this arise so much sorrow and joy—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I love the moon.
Seen through pines, it shines especially bright,

No sooner full than it wanes again.
The Frost Goddess and the Moon Goddess must share this resentment—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I lie awake at midnight.
Wrapped in blankets, sleepless, I toss and turn,
Donning clothes, I sit up, lost in thought.

Virtue and the Dao depend on man—who does not know this?
One must find peace in doing nothing—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I visit friends.
The host with the discerning gaze is not at home,
An old man with white hair returns empty-handed.
A few grand estates bathed in slanting light,
A trace of late spring, the cuckoo’s cry.
Alone I come, alone I go, alone I sit—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I follow my steps.
Before the Gaozu’s old residence, flowers bloom like brocade,

Strolling through gardens, I return late.
Each time a fine breeze arises, I linger—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I ponder.

Poetry is when I brush away dust.
Each time guests arrive, I must be warm and attentive,

The Dao lies before their eyes, yet none see it—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—

And liken my heart and body to deer and elk.
Sixty-five years—a man of no cares—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I wake from sleep.

For in this I perceive the ultimate truth—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I ponder deeply.
With few affairs, the heart is easily content;

In times of peace, never forget peril.
The Dao’s way is clear, yet men remain blind—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I conduct myself.
When governance rests with me, my heart must be whole;

If I betray others, they will have their words.
In taking blame, none is better than self-reproach—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I examine myself.
If righteousness is not upheld, it is cowardice;

I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I fulfill my nature.
Though I dare not claim sageliness or benevolence,

In the bliss of a carefree mind, words fail—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I employ my learning.
Histories reveal order and chaos from beginning to end,

Fuxi could serve as lord of the Three Powers,
Confucius stands as teacher for ten thousand ages.
Not only in past words and deeds—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I come and go.
On soft grass and level sands beneath moonlit slopes,

In warm winds and tender orioles on Golden Valley’s dyke—
All are places where I find joy—
I do not love to write poetry.

Even seal script misread as cursive is not mistaken—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I stroll at dusk.
Freely I pass the former residence of Gaozu,

How would it compare to never having known at all?
I reckon the spirits understand this intent—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I endure hardship.
At the extremity of affairs, I see the Dao’s wonder;

But the pine and cypress are known in the cold of winter.
I have never heard of unyielding stone that could turn its heart—
I do not love to write poetry.

If Heaven had words, men might ask—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I lay down my brush.
The principle of things is to follow the times,
The mechanism of human nature is to find peace.
Firm as metal and stone, yet it can be moved;
Spiritual as ghosts and gods, how can they be deceived?
Beyond this, there are no words to speak—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I marvel at myself.
Vast as the seasons of Heaven, they can still be measured,
Trivial as human affairs, how could they be hard to know?
Who recognizes the fine jade of Kunlun?
Who has glimpsed the bright pearls of the deep sea?
Thus I, Yaofu, can only marvel—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am vigilant in solitude.
A man’s life spans but a hundred years—what more can there be?
A heart that roams ten thousand *ren*—what does it await?
In planning, one must seek a heart without shame;
In acting, never rely on others’ ignorance.
Even ghosts and spirits stand in awe of sincerity—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am cautious with the times.
At the outset of action, weigh right and wrong;
In first befriending others, judge safety and danger.
In foreign lands, loyalty and trust share a love of goodness;
Across different eras, treachery and deceit share a love of self.
Need one wait to compare before seeing this?
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I delight in affairs.
Heaven’s Dao waxes and wanes like a bellows,
The words of sages are like divination by tortoise and milfoil.
Once time has passed, the rope cannot strike,
When strength has waned, medicine cannot heal.
Do not let idle sorrow accompany the setting sun—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I cherish moments.
Why rush to believe in falsehoods?
Why doubt what is true?
If a guest could warn Zengzi,
Why would none speak against Zhongni?
Only the bonds of father and son, ruler and minister remain—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I close my book.
In times of fortune, one may still employ *Guimei*,
In mourning for things, one fears entering *Mingyi*.
How could the glory of Xia and Shang be seen?
How can one bear to think of the decline of Tang and Han?
Yet in the fields, one does not forget the world—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I cherish all things.

At dawn, affairs of the heart must be met with detachment,
Words beyond the dust must ever be fresh and strange.
Do towering mountains and rivers not bear fruit?
The essence of heaven and earth finds its own return.
Only pure *qi* can nurture withered things—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I silently perceive.
Sun and moon come and go in their course,
Gardens flourish and then wither in decline.
Climbing mountains, high and low are plain to see,
But by the waters, who knows the depths?
The world holds boundless matters profound—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I test myself.
Only with familiarity does truth become clear,
Human nature cannot be known in haste.
Though all share the same rain and dew, humble as mugwort,
Only the pine and cypress stand alone through snow and frost.
Seeing often is not like experiencing firsthand—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I sigh in lament.
Deceit runs rampant among men,
And so the world is filled with doubt.
Before the wine jar, Yao and Shun bowed in three cups of courtesy,
Yet at the board, Tang and Wu clashed over a game of chess.
Great and small differ—nothing more—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I lean upon the divining board.
Lawlessness is not unique to ancient times,
How can just governance be seen today?
If once there was a Shaozheng Mao,
Why would there be no Kong Zhongni now?
The age changes, but men remain the same—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I trust myself.
To live without regret,
One must foresee what lies ahead.
Speak loyalty and give all you possess,
Let others doubt your good deeds.
External things are never certain—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I refrain from insistence.
Whether yielding or contending, time has passed,
Things transform and adapt, never the same.
The rules of Fuxi, Xuanyuan, Yao, and Shun,
The models of Tang, Wu, Huan, and Wen—
A stroke is written, then erased—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
A guest asks: what does Yofu do?
When sleep stirs, I draw near the earthen window,
When deep feeling arises, I linger by the basin’s pool.
To seek beauty, I take my small cart,
And when a line comes, I wield my great brush.
Other matters may be idly polished—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I marvel at old age.
Old friends still exchange gold and jade,
While aged couples cherish their coarse fare.
We drink unstrained wine from clay cups,
And play chess on paper boards spread on the ground.
Sixty-six years a man of no affairs—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I delight in stillness.
Too weary to pair herbs as sovereign and minister,
Too tired to shift the zither’s civil and martial tunes.
The dragon and tiger in the tripod are left unguarded,
The rivers and mountains on the board abandoned.
Yet I fear such indulgence may harm my nature—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I jest and laugh.
A man of the realm treats others with full intent,
The mountain elder says I know how to smile.
Cups follow the measure of one’s drink,
The couch shifts with the shade of flowers.
This joy is not easily found again—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am startled.
Morning clouds and evening rain last but half a day,
Spring blossoms and autumn leaves endure but a moment.
Even now, the ways of the world are lamentable,
What will human nature be like hereafter?
How swiftly heat and cold alternate—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I marvel at myself.
Whether affairs are few or many rests with me,
Whether others fret or rejoice is not mine to decide.
Within the gourd, the sun and moon shine eternal,
In the cave, heaven and earth hold spring forever.
Who says time slips by like a fleeting gap—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am at ease.
At dawn, my verses flow without restraint,
How much more when my bold script runs wild.
I covet the spirit of Li and Du,
And admire the style and rhythm of Ou and Wang.
Other matters may be idly played with—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I speak of affairs.
If actions follow principle,
Clarity comes without need for words.
Where plans are difficult, effort is spent,
Where things come easily, direction is spared.
To conceal yet reveal—such things are many—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am pleased.
Observe the subtleties within things,
Discern the nuances among men.
The subtleties within things are seen before the eyes,
The nuances among men are known within the heart.
Yet this is gold no market can buy—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am not forced.
When forced, affairs leave traces,
To know when to stop is to grasp the first sign.
Before you lies good farmland,
Is there no level path in the world?
Many avoid what is effortless—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am pleased.
How can this feeling be put into words?
This joy can only be pursued with delight.
The bearing of immortals is seen in leisure,
The work of the true master is known in stillness.
There is no need for deeper mountains—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I rejoice in old age.
Clad in scholar’s robes, I am a man of learning,
Speaking of benevolence and righteousness, I am a true man.
Dare I open my eyes wide upon the world,
Would I idly furrow my brow at its ways?
Sixty-seven years a man of no affairs—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I defy old age.
Teeth fading, I meet the new year,
Eyes bright, I see old friends again.
Joy wanes with each passing day,
My drinking capacity weakens too.
Sixty-seven years a man of no affairs—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I move with caution.
Seeking fame through crooked ways, fame is lost,
Following desires, the people rebel, desires collapse.
The wise are called virtuous for following the good,
The petty are named villains for concealing faults.
Great flatterers feign loyalty—hard to discern—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I am stirred.
Held in the heart, it may turn to resentment,
Spoken in words, it risks becoming a flaw.
Where orchids and angelica grow, gather them,
When gold and jade appear, do not cast them aside.
At this, I often congratulate myself—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I feel shame.
I receive half the world’s bows in vain,
Yet do nothing for myself.
When my heart is fully given, I find solace,
When my strength falls short, others understand.
I only regret one thing left unsaid—
I do not love to write poetry.

I do not love to write poetry—
Poetry is when I marvel at the sword.
In forging, it stands firm and sharp,
In polishing, it gleams with light.
Leave the coiled serpent and giant boar undisturbed,
Do not let the cunning hare and fox deceive.
This blade has been tempered for years—
I do not love to write poetry.

*Guanghe, Yaofu’s opening and closing verses*

I do not love to write poetry—
In the Nest of Peace, I do nothing.
The ancient Way, though white-haired, finds no use,
Few in this age recognize its worth.
Song Mountain and Luo River remain ever-present,
Autumn moon and spring wind keep their appointed time.
Though my strength wanes, my thoughts stay sharp,
Year by year, I find no decline.

*Haohe*
The Master does not love to write poetry—
It is to capture the moment of supreme joy.
Drunk, the cosmos is contained in all things,
At leisure, who can rival the wind and moon?
Life and death are fated—what can man do?
Waxing and waning follow time—I do not grieve.
Facing the serene and effortless,
The Master does not love to write poetry.

*After reading Bi’s postscript*

The people thrive in Yao’s time,
The name "Yaofu" reveals his virtue.
Reading his new poems, *Striking the Earth*,
The Master embodies the full Dao, lacking nothing.

*Poems Outside the Collection*
**Passing Bi Gan’s Tomb**
His sincerity shone brighter than the sun,
Expressed in words of loyalty.
Though his heart was utterly broken,
The tyrant still did not understand.
His lofty tomb stands by the great road,
Old trees bear no tender branches.
His image endures through the ages,
Yet flatterers mock it with scorn.

**Self-Consolation**
I read, forgetting the years,
Others laugh at my wasted time.
As long as my parents’ needs are met,
Why shun hardship?
The Dragon Spring’s edge is dulled,
Even a snail’s horn holds storms.
They know I serve my aging parents,
But what else might they think?

**Preface to Ten Poems of Gong City**
My family has a garden of several dozen *mu*,
Filled with peaches, plums, pears, and dates,
Located in the western outskirts of Wei.
I have tended it for over ten years,
Yet never once stayed to watch the flowers bloom—
Such is the way of men.
Last winter, I fell ill and returned from the capital.
This spring, I first noticed the flowers’ lushness,
And lamented my own straitened circumstances.
Thus, I wrote a set of poems on the spring countryside.
Though they may not meet refined tastes,
They at least give voice to my feelings.
The year *Qingli Dinghai*.

**1. Dwelling in the Spring Countryside**
Though my home lies near the city walls,
I do not wish to enter the town.
All day, no guests arrive,
By night, the gate remains shut.
The courtyard is still, spring at its peak,
The window idle, I nap through the day.
Who knows that among coarse fare,
There is the savor of poetry and books?

**2. Strolling in the Spring Countryside**
Recovered from illness, I am startled by spring,
Staff in hand, I view the wilds anew.
By the water, I meet a fisherman,
On the ridge, I see a plowman.
I ask of their hardships,
They speak of their meager livelihoods.
I am ashamed my strength cannot aid them,
Failing to serve the people.

**3. Fragrant Grass in the Spring Countryside**
The spring wind must have a blade,
Severing my heart’s tender threads.
If the spring wind has no blade,
Who trims the fragrant grass?
Once severed, the heart cannot rejoin,
Yet the grass, though cut, grows again.
Who has fragrant wine?
Sing for me, and I will drink.

**4. Flowers Blooming in the Spring Countryside**
Peaches and plums spread their fragrance,
Thick blossoms cover my humble hut.
Their sweet scent drifts through the lattice,
Petals scatter on the front steps.
I circle them after my midday rest,
Pluck them lightly in my spring drunkenness.
Though I gaze all day,
Who would fault my wild neglect?

**5. Cold Food Festival in the Spring Countryside**
Flowers bloom thickly beyond the city walls,
I did not expect such splendor to fade.
Fortunate not to be within the walls,
I do not see the city’s finery.
The weather is neither cold nor warm,
The day half-clouded, half-clear.
Beyond the flowers, swings creak,
The moon rises beyond the swings.

**6. Evening View in the Spring Countryside**
Warm winds stir the singing birds,
The sky hangs low with thin clouds.
Mist gathers over the winding ridges,
Rain threatens the river’s heart.
Willows veil the distant city,
Flowers hide the old county town.
I alone pity my ailing body,
Still permitted to seek the late spring.

**7. Rain in the Spring Countryside**
The nine wilds stretch endlessly,
Dusk lingers on the crow’s path.
Seated, I lose sight of distant trees,
Beyond the gate, the front hills vanish.
Raincoat-clad farmers rejoice,
Sheltered dwellers idle.
The poet’s melancholy deepens,
Yet the sky’s mood begins to lift.

**8. After the Rain in the Spring Countryside**
The rain ceases, sweeping away lingering spring,
Heaven’s light reveals its purest truth.
A soft carpet of fragrant grass,
Flowers washed bright as brocade.
The wind stirs the oriole’s song,
Mist smooths the willow’s sash.
How can I face such a scene,
And idly lie through this prosperous time?

**9. Old Wine in the Spring Countryside**
Flowers bloom after wind and rain,
I endure illness, seeking solace.
This is not the height of carefree abandon,
But what can one do in exhaustion?
Swallows dart among the rafters,
Wild geese vanish beyond the sky.
All is ashen in my heart,
Silently, the noon hour passes.

**10. Fallen Flowers in the Spring Countryside**
Late spring brings wind and rain,
Petals scatter across the rear garden.
At dawn, remnants cling in clusters,
In sunlight, crimson flutters in disarray.
The fragrant path cannot retain their wrappings,
Their delicate hearts refuse further play.
Peach and plum, though they make the trail,
Lie in silent, tangled ruin.

**To Yang Xuan**
The Qi River runs clear and bright,
Its spring welling from my land.
When its waters reach your home,
All is but longing for you.
