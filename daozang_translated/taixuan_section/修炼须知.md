### **Essentials of Cultivation: Fire Regulation and Practice**

**Master Boyang** said:
*"The yang-burning mirror draws fire—without the sun, no light is born.
The fangzhu vessel gathers dew—without stars or moon, how could water be obtained?
The two qi are profound and distant, yet their resonance still communicates.
How much more so for the body we inhabit, where all depends on the heart and breast?"*

Yin and yang pair as sun and moon; water and fire serve as their signs of efficacy.

He also said:
*"Nature presides within, establishing the inner citadel;
Emotion operates without, building walls and outer ramparts.
When the city and ramparts are complete, all beings find peace."*

*The Yellow Court Scripture* states:
*"Practice the Dao in leisurely solitude, nurturing life and guarding emptiness."*

**Master Yuandu** said:
*"Those who cultivate the Dao today fail to receive proper transmission and do not comprehend Pengzu’s warning: ‘Without refining the returning elixir, do not enter the mountains.’ Instead, they seek to escape noise for stillness, withdraw from the world, shun society, abandon wives and children, and dwell alone in remote valleys and deep mountains, believing themselves superior. Such people forsake the worldly dharma."*

**Master Wuming** said:
*"In regulating fire, first establish the water clock to distinguish midnight and noon. Then harmonize yin and yang as the foundation of transformation. Arrange the sixty-four hexagrams within the yin tally, and stir the twenty-four qi with the yang fire. The celestial pivot rests in the hand, the earthly axis takes form in the heart. Gather the seventy-two seasonal nodes at the crucial ford, converging within the crucible; seize the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi, concentrating them within the embryo. Be vigilant in withdrawal and addition, single-minded in operation. Guard against danger, prevent peril, ensuring not a moment’s deviation nor the slightest error. Thus, externally, one harmonizes with the tally of yin and yang; internally, the body of True Unity is born. If the mind is careless in regulation and the seasonal nodes diverge, the maiden of mercury will flee, and the numinous embryo will fail to form."*

**Master Yingchan** said:
*"At the initial barrier of gathering the medicine, first recognize the time when heavenly water arises. At the middle barrier, know how to harmonize the true breath, circulating it through the six voids. From the Great Mystery Pass, reverse the flow to the Celestial Valley Cavity for union, then descend to the Yellow Chamber and enter the Central Palace."*

**Master Shangyang** said:
*"Regulating fire means managing both inner and outer fire. Fire is the medicinal fire; the ‘season’ refers to the tally. The tally is the tally of correspondence. When the sage begins the work of elixir refinement, one must know how lead and mercury meet. When the lead of True Unity arrives, move one’s own mercury to welcome it. Once lead and mercury unite, the grain of elixir is obtained and ingested into the Golden Chamber as the elixir’s beginning. In regulating fire, one begins at the *Fu* hexagram at the hour of *zi*. Swiftly advance the yang fire—this is called ‘setting to work’ and ‘waging the wild battle.’ For in the wild battle, dragon and tiger unite, employing three parts martial fire in a short forward movement. In ‘moving the tally,’ at the hour of *wu* when the *Gou* hexagram governs, advance the yin tally, enclosing the yang fire within. Thus, moving the tally is called ‘ceasing work and guarding the city.’ In guarding the city, the inner citadel is already established, so one need only warmly nurture and bathe, preventing subtle decline. This employs seven parts civil fire in a prolonged manner. However, both *Fu* and *Zi* are sought within the human body. One must recognize the origin of one’s own birth to attain it—there is no need to cling rigidly to the text or adhere to symbols."*

**Master Ziyang** in *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* said:
*"The fire’s season does not rely on time; the winter solstice is not confined to *zi*.
Scholars should seek this with utmost care."*

### **New Moons, Full Moons, Quarters, and Dark Moons**

**Master Yuandu** said:
*"A single speck of yang essence is hidden within the mountain of form—not in the heart or kidneys, but in the mysterious pass of the single aperture. Scholars who do not understand yin and yang, who do not know the seasons, cannot return. They grope within their own bodies, mistaking the luminous, numinous spirit of consciousness for the real, only to stray further afield."*

*The Book of Changes* states:
*"Harmonize its brightness with the sun and moon, its sequence with the four seasons."*

**Zhu Zhen** in *Commentary on the Book of Changes* said:
*"At the dark moon’s dawn, the *kan* moon and *li* sun meet at *ren* and *gui*."*

**Master Shangyang** said:
*"At the first dawn of each month’s new moon, at the hour of *zi*, the sun and moon unite as a jade disk at *gui*. At dusk, they meet above *Xu* and *Bi*—this illustrates the fire’s initial arising. At this time, pure yin has reached its extreme, and subtle yang is about to be born—this is called the ‘hidden dragon.’ At the third day’s evening, the moon is born at *geng*, where true yang has just begun. *Geng* belongs to the southwest. The *Book of Changes* says: ‘In the southwest, one finds companions and travels with one’s kind.’ The *Triple Concordance Canon* states: ‘When *kun* first transforms into *zhen*, on the third day the moon emerges at *geng*.’ At this time, the medicinal ingredients have just arisen, the water source is utterly clear, undisturbed, in the moment between having qi but no form. The great cultivator, at this very time, must possess a single eye of wisdom to observe and model it—just as the great yin first receives a single yang’s qi, or as *kun*’s lower line exchanges with *qian*’s initial line to become *zhen*, akin to the human body’s pure yin generating a single yang. As my teacher said: ‘The primordial qi of pre-heaven comes from emptiness, infusing mercury and entering the crucible.’ At this time, yang qi first spreads within the crucible, and cinnabar mercury establishes its foundation."*

**Master Zixian** said:
*"One clear, one turbid—metal and wood are separated at the gate of *wu* and *ji*;
One nature, one emotion—yin and yang gather at the door of life and death.
Gather the qi of the two poles before their division, seize the essence of dragon and tiger at their first union, enter the Yellow Chamber, and produce the supreme treasure."*

At the eighth day’s hour of *you*, the moon reaches the center of the sky, level as a taut cord—this is called the *upper quarter*, obtaining half a catty of gold.

The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states: When *kun* transforms twice to become *dui*, on the eighth day the moon emerges at *ding*, resembling the gradual coagulation of lead and mercury within the crucible into flowing pearls. At this time, the qi of metal and water stabilizes—neither advancing the firing of the furnace nor applying talismanic activation, only bathing and cleansing the heart-mind.

At fifteen days comes the full moon, when the sun and moon irradiate each other, the three yang within yin are complete and form *qian*, just as the lunar essence receives the solar spirit to become full. This metaphorically describes the robust flourishing of lead and mercury within the crucible, true yang filling to abundance, fire bright and metal flourishing, on the verge of forming the elixir—where the qi of metal and fire solidifies with mercury, and mercury lingers fondly with its mother. At dawn following the full moon, the moon appears in the *xin* direction, *qian* first transforming into *xun*, embodying the Way of yin and yang mutually sustaining each other. Initially, pure yin receives the union of subtle yang to generate the medicine; later, yin envelops yang qi to form the cinnabar. *Xun* then receives and guides the yin talisman, yin qi gradually arising to envelop and secure the yang essence, preventing its dispersal—thus gold and cinnabar settle within the womb, yin containing yang, which is called *returning to the root*. At dawn on the twenty-third day, the moon appears in the *bing* direction, *kun* intersecting the middle line of *qian* to form *gen*, and the medicine within the crucible naturally congeals. At this time, the qi of yin and yang again stabilizes—neither applying the yin talisman nor advancing the fire, only resting, bathing, and purifying thoughts. This is the *lower quarter*, obtaining half a catty of water. Combining the half-catty of gold from the upper quarter and the half-catty of water from the lower quarter yields the full catty’s measure to coagulate the cinnabar elixir. The *Triple Concordance* states: “When the two quarters unite their essence, the bodies of *qian* and *kun* are complete.”

At dawn on the twenty-eighth day, the moon appears in the *yi* direction; at this time, the qi of yin and yang are both fulfilled, gold and mercury congeal to form the embryo, *kan* and *li* circulate qi within the crucible, coursing through the six voids within the symbolic realm—this metaphorically describes the beginning and end of the golden elixir. By the final day of the lunar cycle, the sun again meets at *ren*, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is about to arise anew.

Master Shangyang said: Though the divisions within the lunar cycle are clearly delineated, the student of immortality must embody them within the self. The dark moon, new moon, quarters, and full moon all serve as verification within the body—one must not cling to the text and become attached to images. The moon is purely yin; without receiving the sun’s yang qi, how could it wane and then regenerate? Humans are like the moon: in the prime of youth at sixteen, when the primordial chaos has not yet divided, yang is pure and qi is whole, thus their essence is vigorous and on the verge of spilling. Before it spills, this is pure yang, called the *True Person*. Thus Guangchengzi told the Yellow Emperor: “The eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing, the heart knows nothing—then spirit will guard the form, and the form will attain longevity.” After the first spillage, one yang departs and one yin enters, transforming into *li*. From this point onward, emotions and desires sprout, primordial simplicity scatters, essence and qi daily diminish, diminishing further until yang is exhausted and yin becomes pure. Those who do not know the Way of the golden liquid returning elixir will die once yang is spent and yin is pure. Only the practitioner, understanding the marvel of return, seizes the moment before yang is exhausted to urgently cultivate, swiftly aiding and rescuing the true yang, gathering and guiding the medicinal fire to refine the returning elixir and restore life—just as the great yin receives and reflects the qi of the great yang to restore its brightness.

Master Yuan Du said: Those who study the *Complete Reality* may receive their teacher’s brief guidance on the path but remain ignorant of the step-by-step procedures; they may know that spirit and qi depend on each other but not how lead and mercury unite; even if they know of the union of lead and mercury, they may not comprehend the fusion of nature and life, rashly attempting to regulate the firing times without knowing how—all such efforts will fail.

Master Zhenyi said: If the yang fire exceeds its measure, water and drought become unbalanced, and the frozen winter transforms into scorching summer. If the yin talisman loses its rhythm, cold and warmth encroach upon each other, and the height of summer reverses into thick frost. When the golden palace fails to germinate cinnabar and mercury, the crucible spawns insects and worms. In major cases, mountains collapse and the earth splits, the metal tiger and wood dragon boil over; in minor cases, violent rain and whirlwinds arise, the *kan* male and *li* female flee in chaos. From this perspective, even if one recognizes the two substances of lead and mercury, without understanding the firing times or guarding against danger, all is in vain.

Master Shangyang said: Guarding against danger and preventing loss are the great matters of the golden elixir. Formerly, Master Bai of Purple Clarity, having received transmission from the Mud-Pill Elder, was already sixty-four years old. He hastily gathered the great ingredients for the golden elixir, enduring myriad hardships and toils, and succeeded in uniting lead and mercury, placing them in the crucible to refine. Though naturally intelligent, during the period of nurturing he was careless, failing to guard against danger—unaware, the mercury fled and the lead scattered, beyond recovery. He then composed a poem to dispel his frustration:

Eight ounces of sun and moon essence,
Half a catty of cloud and mist fragments.
Light as a goose feather,
Heavy as a thousand-weight iron.
White as heaven’s snow,
Red as the blood of the *xingxing*.
Gathered into a jade gourd,
Secreted away, not to be leaked.
At midnight, sudden wind and thunder,
Smoke and vapor fill the vast expanse.
Such flavor and feeling—
A mute bites his tongue.
Clutching his belly, he laughs,
Lest his heart and brain grow hot.
He must mend his fishing rod,
And again cut the autumn bamboo’s joints.

Seeing this, how can one not be cautious? Had Master Bai not been so resolute, how could another mend the fishing rod and cut the bamboo’s joints? Later, he received the *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* from the Immortal Master of Purple Yang, who instructed him to guard and be vigilant—only then did he attain the Dao.

Guarding against danger and preventing loss is not merely one concern but encompasses several aspects. At the initial stage of gathering the medicine, when the sun and moon joyfully meet and the dragon and tiger are about to unite, during the moment of conflict, the *True Person* already hides in the deep abyss, floating and cautiously guarding within the compass.

At this moment, one must seal the Three Treasures and focus the mind with single-minded devotion—otherwise, there is risk of losing one’s body and life. Master Purple Yang said: "The White Tiger’s first scripture is the supreme treasure; the divine water of the Flowery Pond is true gold." He also said: "When gathering in due time, be certain of floating and sinking; when advancing the fire, guard most vigilantly against peril." This is the most critical point of the initial barrier—this is the first concern.

During the gathering, if yin and yang become disordered and the sun and moon fall out of harmony, though the external fire moves and proceeds, the internal tally remains closed and unresponsive, all effort will be wasted—this is the second concern. If the fire timing errs and the water pearl is unsettled, the source and flow grow turbid, the medicine loses its authenticity, and one labors in vain, gaining nothing but harm—this is the third concern.

Once the millet pearl enters the crucible, it must be warmed and nurtured, the Heart Monarch protected and supported. Should care be lacking, the fire may transform and the elixir be lost—this is the fourth concern. Some practitioners endure hardships and repeatedly face dangers, their hearts and gallbladders shaken with fear. Even if they have previously obtained the elixir and placed it in the crucible, they must thoroughly expel all distractions, ensuring purity and preventing old anxieties from disturbing the Heart Monarch. This is called "cleansing thoughts and washing the heart"—it is the "bathing." Should lingering attachments remain, mercury and lead may flee—this is the fifth concern.

When the ten-month gestation is complete and the embryo sheds its shell to change crucibles, if the yang spirit is not firmly preserved and is carelessly released, it may depart and lose its way, becoming homeless and without return—this is the sixth concern. After the elixir is formed, one must further discern truth from falsehood. If merit and conduct are not yet fulfilled, one may suddenly witness manifold marvels and extraordinary phenomena, even perceiving matters of past and future lives as if spirits were manifest—all of which can be clearly known. Such occurrences are demonic obstructions, not true realities. One must not mistake them for the sacred elixir of attainment. These are deceptions and illusions; seeing our Dao nearing completion, they seek to lure us into heterodox paths and disrupt our truth. At this time, one must steadfastly uphold wisdom and preserve the integrity of the true—this is the seventh concern.

These seven concerns are the greatest matters of vigilance. Should any be neglected, not only will there be no success, but one may even suffer loss. Ancestor True Yang said: "Having realized the carefree heart of non-action, one must nurture and protect the true. Bathe for a year to guard against danger, lest one sink into delusion and labor in vain."

I thus speak of guarding against danger and preventing loss—these are the great matters of the remaining elixir.

**The Punishment and Virtue of Mao and You**
True Man Purple Yang said: "In the months of the hare and the rooster, at their appointed times, punishment and virtue arrive at the gate—such is the image of the medicine." Master Upper Yang said: "The hare and the rooster are *mao* and *you*." Those who study the Dao must understand *mao* and *you*—there is more than one meaning.

There are the *mao* and *you* of heaven and earth, of a year, of a month, of a day, and of an hour. The *mao* and *you* of heaven and earth: the constellations *Shi*, *Fang*, and *Xin* are *mao*; when the sun’s path aligns with *Fang*, it is the day of the hare. The constellations *Wei*, *Mao*, and *Bi* are *you*; when the sun’s path aligns with *Mao*, it is the day of the rooster.

The *mao* and *you* of a year: the spring equinox is *mao*, when the time and day are in harmony; the autumn equinox is *you*, the season called Mid-Autumn. The *mao* and *you* of a month: the eighth day is *mao*, when the moon is full at the upper quarter and, at the *you* hour, reaches the center of the sky; the twenty-third day is *you*, when the moon lingers at the lower quarter and, at the *mao* hour, is at the sky’s center.

The *mao* and *you* of a day: sunrise is *mao*, when all things arise; sunset is *you*, when all sounds cease. The *mao* and *you* of an hour: this is the method of concentration. Concentrating a year into a month, two and a half days become six periods; concentrating a month into a day, one hour is divided into six periods. Thus, the seventy-two periods of a year are concentrated into a single day. Know then that within a year, there is but one day; within a day, but one hour. Great cultivators must discern the *mao* and *you* within the hour and understand the six periods of an hour.

When gathering the medicine and extracting lead, only two of the six periods in an hour are used—like employing one part of three. The remaining four periods in an hour have other subtle uses. As for punishment and virtue, they are the two and the eight. The two and the eight are *mao* and *you*. *Mao* and *you* are the positions where yin and yang are evenly divided: yang is virtue, and virtue gives life to all things; yin is punishment, and punishment brings death to all things.

In the *mao* month, there are four yang and two yin. The yin path is about to depart, and yin governs killing. Thus, in *mao*’s two yin, yin can no longer overcome yang, yet the killing qi has not ceased. At this time, the elm dies—hence, it is punishment. In the *you* month, there are four yin and two yang. The yang path is about to depart, and yang governs generation. Thus, in *you*’s two yang, yang cannot overcome yin, yet the intent of life remains. At this time, the wheat sprouts—hence, it is virtue.

Ancestor True Yang inquired: "All is the turning of the numinous and the obscure; one must focus the mind and preserve the initial heart."

**Bathing the Heart and Thoughts**
The *Poem of Pointing Out Delusion* says:
"The work of bathing lies not elsewhere,
But wholly in the nursing mother’s flawless care.
The five phases harmonize, yin and yang align,
Together they sit, together they walk, as one family."

Master Nameless said: "When yang qi reaches the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang are evenly balanced, neither cold nor hot but warm—this is the *Tai* hexagram. Without advancing the fire timing, it is called bathing. When yin qi descends to the center of heaven and earth, yin and yang are evenly balanced, neither hot nor cold but cool—this is the *Pi* hexagram. Without advancing the yin tally, it is also called bathing."

Master Upper Yang said: "In ordinary bathing, when yin and yang are in equilibrium and the qi of lead and mercury are at rest, the two qi naturally unite. At this time, one must not advance the fire nor move the tally, lest the elixir be harmed."

Here is the translation:

---

One should only purify the heart and cleanse the mind to preserve and nurture it—this is called "bathing."

What, then, is bathing? For the great cultivator, it means wholly shedding the heart burdened by worldly cares, hardships, attachments, and desires—casting them off with effortless ease, leaving not a single thread of entanglement. The body must become like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes: this is bathing.

Master Pure Yang said: "The original nature delights in clarity and stillness; preserve it by taming the monkey-mind." Master Dan Yang said: "Fire arises in water—dismiss the mind’s scenery; flowers bloom in snow—lessen the spring of intent." He also said: "The common person lacks a heart of purity; the Daoist lacks a heart of worldly dust—this is called washing and cleansing."

At this time, the hour approaches *mao* and *you*; the hexagrams are *Pi* and *Tai*; the phase belongs to warmth and coolness; the image is that of *xing* (punishment) and *de* (virtue). Here, one ceases the firing and guards the city—this is called bathing.

The *Cantong Qi* says:
*"Observe with utmost care, examine and adjust cold and warmth.
Cycle through the twelve nodes; when each is complete, attend closely again."*

Master Cui’s *Ruyao Jing* states:
*"Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against turning it ominous.
When the fire timing is sufficient, do not harm the elixir.
Heaven and earth are numinous, yet creation is niggardly."*

True Man Zi Yang wrote to Bai Ziqing:
*"As for the bathing method, compare it to the empty hours of *mao* and *you*.
Yet do not cling to external appearances—take it when the medicine and fire arrive."*

An ancient song says:
*"Punishment and virtue together give life and death,
Arriving at the gates of two and eight.
Cinnabar should be bathed; divine water washes the numinous root.
Seal the mouth to retain gold and mercury; guard the pass to nurture spirit and soul.
No need to advance the fire timing—the furnace remains gently warm."*

When the great cultivator’s work reaches this point, how can one not be cautious!

**The Scales of Life and Death**
True Man Zi Yang said: "Those who refine the golden liquid and returning elixir must thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, pursue the two qi along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the primordial palace, gather the five phases, harmonize the four images, where dragon intones and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows."

My former teacher said: "Only when a Daoist adept obtains the truth of inner and outer medicines, masters their dual functions, and aligns with the great workings of creation can they receive the transmission. If there is even a hair’s breadth of deviation, heaven and earth remain far apart."

Master Upper Yang said: "Life and death are the two things of yin and yang, the two things of dragon and tiger. The dragon, yang within yin, governs life—stirring clouds and summoning rain to nourish the myriad things—yet its inner yin can kill. Like a person whose yang is exhausted and pure yin remains, they die. The tiger, yin within yang, governs death—howling winds and roaring with a constant killing intent—yet its inner yang can give life. Like a person whose yin is exhausted and pure yang remains, they become immortal.

The two things of yin and yang, when flowing in sequence, form humans; when reversed, they generate the elixir. If they do not become the myriad things or humans, they form the elixir—this is what is meant by life.

What, then, does life give life to? Is it not life for heaven and earth, life for humans and the five phases, life for the myriad things? Is it not the possession of great spiritual penetration and wisdom, of vast divine and sacred transformations?

What, then, does death kill? Is it not the thief of ignorance and affliction? Is it not the thief of heterodox paths and foolish delusion? Ancestor Jing Yang slew them with the swords of five maidens; Emperor Pure Yang, with the Three Clarities’ sword; the Buddha, with the Vajra King’s precious sword; Master Deshan, with the staff at the gate. Thus it is said: to protect life, one must kill; only when all is slain can one dwell in peace.

An ancestor said: 'Slaying demons and banishing specters leads to longevity.' *Chi* is stupidity; *mei* is delusion. If one early slays this foolish, dark, and deluded self, one may complete the Way of eternal life. The great cultivator must know that even a hair’s deviation prevents the elixir’s formation—one must thoroughly understand this. If one awakens to the two things of yin-yang and life-death, what worry is there of not attaining immortality?

As for the explanations of hexagrams, lines, and weights: *zhu* serves as the standard for measurement; *yao* serves as the model for application; *xiang* serves as the image to emulate; *gua* serves as the hanging sign to guide others, establishing a rule for all to follow. *Yao* and *zhu* clarify lightness and weight; *xiang* and *gua* clarify advance and retreat.

Accumulating three hundred eighty-four lines forms sixty-four hexagrams; accumulating three hundred eighty-four *zhu* forms sixteen ounces—one *jin*. When the *jin* is complete and the hexagrams are full, it signifies the elixir’s near completion. The cultivator must strive to know lightness and recognize shallowness, know weight and recognize depth, know difficulty and recognize retreat, know ease and recognize advance—all to master the inner and outer medicines of the golden elixir.

The *Daode Jing* says: "Being and non-being give rise to each other; difficulty and ease complete each other." It also says: "Plan for difficulty while it is easy; achieve greatness while it is small." And: "Thus the sage treats things as difficult, and so ultimately encounters no difficulty."

Taking *Fu* and *Zhen* as the beginning of gathering medicine, half a *jin* is the measure for entering the medicine. Regarding the saying of "one hundred lines," thirty lines represent the civil and seventy the martial—thus one knows the difficulty of gathering medicine. When the hexagrams are complete and the medicine is formed, the elixir reaches the measure of two eights, one *jin*.

Thus the *Huohuo Ji* speaks of two hundred sixteen, the count of *Qian*; eighteen eights make one hundred forty-four, the count of *Kun*. When the numbers of yin and yang are complete, the golden liquid elixir is formed.

**The Seven Matters of Cultivating the Real**
Master Upper Yang said: "The Way must be studied daily; study must be daily refined."

Laozi said: "I am no sage, yet through learning I attained it."
Confucius said: "In a hamlet of ten households, there must be one as loyal and trustworthy as I, yet none matches my love of learning." He also said: "I never tire of learning, nor weary of teaching." And again: "When a noble person studies the Dao, they come to love others; when a petty person studies the Dao, they become easier to employ."

The *Nanhua Sutra* records:
Nanbo Zikui asked Nü’ou: "Can the Dao be learned?"
Nü’ou replied: "How could it not be? But you are not the right person. Though Bu Liangyi possessed the talent of a sage, he lacked the Dao of a sage; I possess the Dao of a sage, yet lack the talent of a sage. If I were to teach him, might he not become a sage? Otherwise, imparting the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy indeed."

Confucius said: "Those who know from birth are the highest; those who know through learning come next; those who learn through hardship come after; those who suffer hardship yet do not learn—such people are the lowest."

Śākyamuni, upon hearing half a verse, was willing to sacrifice his body. The Yellow Emperor, humbly following the wind and crawling forward on his knees, asked Guangchengzi: "How should one cultivate the body to attain longevity?"

Truly, even the greatest sages of antiquity never came to know the Great Dao without learning. Yet people today are often reckless and deluded, unwilling to humble themselves and ask—when will they ever hear of this Dao?

Master Upper Yang said: "The Dao may be conveyed in casual conversation, or transmitted through the heart. The relationships of ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brother, husband and wife, and friends—these are the unchanging principles of human relations. These may be discussed in conversation, but not transmitted through the heart.

What is meant by 'transmission through the heart'? 'Heaven’s mandate is called nature; following nature is called the Dao.' This can be transmitted through the heart, but not in casual conversation. Following nature is what Confucius meant by 'the one thread'; it is what Mencius meant by 'the vitality that arises from accumulating rightness.'

The principles of human relations, though even a child can be taught them, are entrusted to officials by those who govern states and nations, enduring unchanged for ten thousand generations. Yet as for the Dao of following nature and accumulating rightness, the commentaries of former worthies barely touch upon it. If a worthy or noble person meets a sagely teacher and receives oral instruction without doubt, cultivating the Dao of following nature and accumulating rightness, they may be called a great sage—and only then will they understand that the principles of human relations are contained within it.

Alchemy, cinnabar, sulfur, and mercury—these are the methods of refinement. These may be discussed in conversation, but not transmitted through the heart. What is meant by 'transmission through the heart'? 'Non-action that leaves nothing undone; action that accomplishes all.' This can be transmitted through the heart, but not in casual conversation. The Dao of non-action and action is the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir.

The methods of refining furnaces, ordinary cinnabar, and mercury—even fools and simple women can practice them, so they may be discussed in conversation. But as for the Dao of primordial true lead and action, even the most advanced adepts, upon receiving oral instruction from a teacher, cannot avoid doubt. If such an adept meets a teacher who points out the Dao of action in the Golden Elixir and diligently cultivates it, they may be called an immortal.

Sitting in dull meditation, guarding one’s nature, and observing fasts—these are the methods of seated meditation. These may be discussed in conversation, but not transmitted through the heart. Only the treasury of the true Dharma-eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana, the direct pointing to the human mind, and the Dao of seeing one’s nature and becoming a buddha—these can be transmitted through the heart, but not in casual conversation. The treasury of the true Dharma-eye and the direct pointing to the human mind are the supreme vehicle of the Dao.

The practices of fasting and seated meditation—even the dullest and most ignorant can discuss them in conversation. But as for the supreme vehicle, even those of sharpest faculties and highest wisdom, upon hearing the words of buddhas and patriarchs and attaining realization, cannot avoid doubt. Thus, at the assembly on Vulture Peak, five thousand left their seats; the Fifth Patriarch did not transmit the Dharma to Shenxiu but to the old man Huineng. This is what is meant by 'transmission through the heart, not in casual conversation.'

When Han Xiang attained immortality, Han Yu wrote of 'gathering my bones'—was Han Yu of such dull capacity? When Zhu Xi sought instruction far and wide, Cui Zixu refused to teach him the Dao—was it that Zhu Xi did not desire it? This is to say: the Dao cannot be conveyed in casual conversation; what can be so conveyed is not the Great Dao.

When Ge Xianweng was sixty, he finally met a teacher; when Bai Yuchan was sixty, he finally learned what must be known to practice refinement—yet both attained the Dao. This is what is meant by 'the Dao transmitted through the heart.'

Master Upper Yang said: "The Dao has three awakenings."

Confucius, in his commentary on the *Yijing*, said: "Draw near and take from the self; draw far and take from things." This speaks of the Dao. The great practitioner seeks it in the four: near and far, self and things—right before their eyes, there is a place of awakening.

Laozi’s *Classic of Constant Clarity and Stillness* says: "Look within at the heart—there is no heart; look without at the form—there is no form; look far at things—there are no things." This speaks of the Dao. The great practitioner seeks it in the six: within and without, far, heart, form, and things—right now, there is a place of awakening.

The buddha-ancestors say: "Not mind, not buddha, not things." This speaks of the Dao. The great practitioner seeks it in the three: mind, buddha, and things—right beneath their feet, there is a place of awakening. These are what is meant by the Dao’s three awakenings.

Moreover, the sagely teachers of the Three Teachings all warn that worldly people seek the Dao in things, taking the Dao as a thing. One must reflect carefully and not pass over this lightly. For the Dao is one thing among the ten thousand things, yet the ten thousand things are one thing within the Great Dao.

Thus Laozi said: "The named is the mother of the ten thousand things." And again: "Abysmal! It seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things."

All these name the Dao through things. Pity the common folk—ever ordinary, unwilling to seek what is above. Some cultivate solitary yin and scant yang, sitting rigid in stillness; some keep fasts, hold precepts, and withdraw from the world to escape dust; some refine cinnabar, lead, silver, and silk in furnace fires. All these are errors, not awakenings. If one can strike the mark beneath the words of this compilation, there must be a singular, extraordinary great awakening.

Master Shangyang said: The Dao is transmitted in three ways. The highest: scholars and virtuous gentlemen, sparing of speech and fond of goodness, able to renounce wealth and honor, urgent only for their own person—these are called superior persons, fit to receive the Dao. The middle: plain and unadorned, they hear the Dao and believe deeply, able to sever ties of affection, practicing with vigor and perseverance, heedless of right and wrong—these are called middling persons, possessing the aspiration of superior persons, fit to receive the Dao. The lowest: simple and sincere, they delight in goodness and cast off evil, yielding themselves to others, bold in daring action—these are called inferior persons, their aspiration worthy of esteem, fit to receive the Dao. Thus those who attain this Dao are all bold and vigorous in practice, all steadfast in wisdom, all restraining evil and exalting goodness.

The word "goodness" is the ladder and ferry to enter the Dao. Therefore, when the ears of common folk constantly hear goodness, the kidneys do not leak essence; when the mouth constantly speaks goodness, the heart does not lose spirit; when the nose constantly smells goodness, the lungs stabilize the po; when the eyes constantly see goodness, the liver nurtures the hun; when the mind constantly thinks goodness, the spleen and stomach generate qi, and the yellow center flows with principle. Great practitioners—how can they not be good?

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has three precepts. For those who study the Dao: though their hearts yearn for it, they may flaunt their wealth and rank, unwilling to humble themselves to ask, refusing to take vows—these are called deceitful and cunning, to be precepted against and not transmitted to. Next, those who study the Dao: having heard minor arts of side doors, they engage in empty debate to display dry wisdom—these are called slanderous and deluded, to be precepted against and not transmitted to. Third, those who study the Dao: half in doubt, half in faith, not concerned with life and death, valuing wealth over their own bodies—these do not know fate, to be precepted against and not transmitted to.

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has three things to cast away. First, though one may be a wise and talented scholar, if fond of discussing the faults of ancients, this is called lacking virtue—it should be cast away. Second, though one may be a good and outstanding person, if fond of slandering and disputing right and wrong, recklessly judging past and present, this is called lacking breadth—it should be cast away. Third, though one may be devoted to the Dao and inclined toward the Buddha, if their words do not match their heart, turning from truth to falsehood, this is called lacking substance—it should be cast away.

Master Shangyang said: The Dao has four distinctions. What are the four? Wine, sex, wealth, and temper. Common folk, when drinking even a little, become drunk: their usual dignity turns to jest, their usual integrity to flattery, their usual honesty to greed and lewdness, their usual modesty to arrogance. Through wine, they lose virtue and flee their true nature. Like a mountain or marsh hiding many things, ordinarily unnoticed, suddenly wildfire blazes, the mountain reddens and the marsh heats, and a thousand demons and hundred monsters have nowhere to flee. If people do not drink, they do not lose their conduct; if mountains do not burn, demons hide their forms. Great practitioners, abstaining from drink and sitting in stillness, gather essence and harmonize spirit, not disordered by wine—this is the distinction.

In the world, many are ruined by sensual pleasures. Common folk indulge their passions and desires without restraint, insatiably attached. Like mayflies drawn to lamplight, taking flame for medicine, they rush into the fire, coming and going without cease, attached to the blaze, hurling themselves at the lamp. People are the same: clinging to love and desire, their essence and qi are exhausted, yet their passions are hard to sever. Passion drags spirit away, intention stirs and qi scatters; when spirit and qi are lost, life follows in departure. Sex, though lacking blade or spear, kills more surely than halberd or pike. Great practitioners, seemingly the same yet distinct: in wine shops and brothels, they do not refrain from play, yet they do not take sex as sex, knowing sex yet not sex, finding sex within not-sex, sex without fixed sex—this is the distinction.

What is meant by "not taking sex as sex"? Like the lotus flower, its fragrance wafting ten miles—though the flower is sex, its scent is sound. Great practitioners do not value its fragrance, do not value its flower; what they value is only its trustworthiness. Trust is like the lotus flower and its scent, which cannot long remain; the lotus seed endures, the seed can settle the heart—thus it is called trust, and so it is valued. Therefore, the Most High said: "Its essence is most true, within it there is trust"—this is the meaning.

What is meant by "knowing sex yet not sex"? Like river water, its clear flow trickling, water ferries the boat to the far shore—yet both boat and water are external things. The patriarchs did not say: "When the Dao is accomplished, the elixir chamber’s vessels are abandoned and left behind"? This is the meaning.

What is "finding sex within not-sex"?

As in a great drought, dark clouds gather on all sides, and sweet rain suddenly falls—yet in an instant, the sky clears again. If one seeks the rainclouds of before, nothing remains to be seen; only the myriad grains and plants are moistened and quickened to life. The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* says: "Roaming the four crossroads, benefiting sentient beings; entering the houses of lust, demonstrating the Way of desire." This is the meaning.

What is meant by "form having no fixed form"?
Like the precious moon, twelve times a year—new moon, full moon, crescent, and waning—within its ceaseless change, there is great constancy. Master Shangyang said: "When assessing it, on the third day the first sliver appears, and form is greatly settled; on the eighth day, half-full, this is called the first quarter; on the fifteenth, full and bright, its radiance fills all—none among mortals do not gaze upon it. Yet its light, round and then incomplete, does not long endure. If one wishes to see its brilliance again, one must seek anew the waxing crescent, the full moon. Thus the *Book of Changes* says: 'Its virtue joins with heaven and earth, its brightness joins with sun and moon.' It also says: 'Tracing the beginning to the end, one knows the discourse on life and death.'" This is what is meant by "no fixed form."

All ordinary people covet wealth insatiably, hoarding without dispersing. Planning for children and grandchildren, they do not comprehend the principle of heaven and earth, sun and moon—waxing and waning, ebb and flow. Like Shi Chong, whose wealth rivaled the state, amassing riches bred resentment; he was executed, his family ruined, and disaster befell Green Pearl. The great practitioner, having obtained wealth, immediately uses it to seek medicine and refine the elixir. Once the elixir is complete, all the rest is dispersed—this is the difference.

All ordinary people exhaust themselves in petty strife, disturbing body and mind. Fond of litigation, they deceive the poor, seizing what they can, heedless of karmic consequences or the cycle of life and death. Unaware of regret, misfortune, and peril, all arise from this. What they contend for is little; what they lose is much. Like Xiang Yu, peerless hero of his age, who in the end perished at Wu River—his body torn apart, his corpse divided. Later generations saw him as but a hound or hawk for Han. What men contend for is far less than this.

The qi that the great practitioner contends for is not what others know—it is the primordial True Unity of heaven and earth. Master Shangyang said: "To cultivate immortality or become a buddha, it is all through this primordial True Unity. Without this qi, no practice can be undertaken, and one cannot attain long life." This is the difference.
