The Jade Guardian, the Azure Lad Dao Lord, first entered the Dao’s realm, drifting through the cinnabar groves of the empyrean, gazing down upon the abyssal seas. He drew in the savor of flowing essence, nurturing and coalescing the radiant lad. A day’s journey spanned ten thousand leagues when suddenly the Nine Gates swung open. Cinnabar light and purple auroras merged with the misty qi, their brilliance commingling. The Five Thearchs clapped their hands, divine birds pecked at the dawn, and as his eyes and mind fixed upon the vision, his essence and spirit intertwined. Supreme harmony arose of itself, and his golden body flowed in perfect accord.

The Jade Guardian, the Azure Lad Dao Lord, summoned and beckoned in leisure, for from utmost emptiness the spirit is born. Reposing in the Mysterious Palace, the Three Origins and Nine Beginnings never failed to attend his court. Suddenly, a divine personage appeared, cleaving the clouds and wearing the moon, his sash woven with celestial asterisms. His jade-like countenance was refined and keen, his azure bones supple and luminous. He addressed the Azure Lad, saying:

"You have distantly absorbed the essence of the sun and seated yourself to receive the fluid of the moon. You shall attain the Heavenly Flower and nurture your golden form."

Thereupon, the twin luminaries divided their light, illuminating your body through and through. Within your cinnabar field, a mushroom of immortality spontaneously sprouted, its jade blossoms resplendent. He revealed to you the essential formula, enabling mortals to know the True Unity and attain the Peerless Flower, thereby ascending with a transcendent body.

The Peerless Flower is the luxuriant sprout of the Azure Yang. The True Lad is the first male offspring of the Azure Lad. Envision him within your body, and when you summon him in thought, he shall come. Upon his arrival, you shall wander together, merging and transforming as one. The summoning follows a proper sequence; the principle admits no recklessness.

Now, the qi of your body transmits the essence of water, forming the will. The will is earth, whence fire arises. Earth transmits the essence of fire to become spirit. When spirit and qi accumulate and coalesce, bones form. The essence of bones becomes the pupil within your eye. The orbits of your eyes are the Mysterious Windows of your body. The twin gleaming pearls are your spirit-mirror, which above connects with the light of the sun and moon, and below irrigates your Reclining Ox. These several elements are what summon the Peerless Flower.

The Peerless Flower is a numinous entity; when it comes, you shall know it of yourself. On the appointed day, watch for it. When it arrives, the place shall stir, and a presence shall attach itself within your body. To proceed, face the sun and bow in invocation. First, gaze directly at it, and you shall see a red qi filling the space before you. Then close your eyes, and you shall behold the red hue intensify, surging like waves. Immediately shut your eyes tightly and peer through the skin’s texture with the essence of your eyes. You shall see a crimson-purple hue suffused with the luster of treasure, within which a hundred floral patterns revolve like a chariot’s wheel.

Thereupon, draw it in through your nose. It shall descend from the nape, traverse the spine, pierce the kidneys, and reach the heels, then ascend once more to penetrate the cinnabar field. Behold its color as before, and intone with your heart:

*"The spirit summons and the qi responds; within, I envision what comes from without. Spirit and qi meet in secret union; the sun’s crystal scatters mist. Wash clean my old marrow, prolong and renew my life. Peerless Flower of Azure Yang, luxuriant sprout burgeoning forth! Open the shadows of yin, banish the forms of demons. Sun and moon fuse their light to nurture my sacred body. Ascend to the Jade Guardian, minister to the sages to come."*

The method for the moon is the same. On the appointed day and hour, seclude yourself in repose. With your heart, watch for the arrival of the presence, which shall enter at the designated place.

The left foot corresponds to the *Beginning of Spring*; the days are *wuyin* and *jichou*.
The left breast corresponds to the *Spring Equinox*; the day is *yimao*.
The left hand corresponds to the *Beginning of Summer*; the days are *wuchen* and *jisi*.
The throat, head, and crown correspond to the *Summer Solstice*; the day is *bingwu*.
The right hand corresponds to the *Beginning of Autumn*; the days are *wushen* and *jiwei*.
The right breast corresponds to the *Autumn Equinox*; the day is *xinyou*.
The right foot corresponds to the *Beginning of Winter*; the days are *wuxu* and *jihai*.
The lower cavity beneath the loins corresponds to the *Winter Solstice*; the day is *renzi*.

On these days and hours, watch for it, drawing it back into the cinnabar field. Observe what you have attained. It need not always reach its designated place, for the Peerless Flower aligns with the yearly cyclical signs, naturally wandering within the body of its own accord.

At the juncture where the two luminaries meet, practice this at dawn each day. In nightly meditation, a flying light may suddenly appear before you; when you look upon it, it shall vanish. With time, you may stabilize your vision, and within the light, the form of the entity shall become distinct—this is the appearance of your Peerless Flower. The cinnabar field shall also bear this form. Practicing this leads to the perfection of Supreme Clarity; it is not a teaching conferred upon lesser students.

The Azure Lad Dao Lord practiced this Dao, transmitting the formula from the Jade Palace of the Bound Blossoms to the perfected ones, in accordance with the luminous statutes.

Here ends the transmission of *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Union of the Peerless Flower Lad in Internal Transformation of Jade*, as taught by the Azure Radiance Guardian of the Eastern Florescence, the Mysterious Yellow Dao Lord.
