**Supreme Mystery Treasure Canon, Volume One**
**Gate of Cultivating the True and Embracing Quiescence**

**Chapter on the Divine and Celestial Images**
Qi in emptiness generates spirit; spirit in emptiness generates transformation; transformation in emptiness generates images—all emerge from the Great Void. The Great Void resides within Heaven and Earth, boundless and formless, neither qi nor shape. Within it lie images: the clear becomes Heaven, the turbid becomes Earth. When clear and turbid divide, humans are born, yet humans do not possess clear or turbid. Once clear and turbid separate, the Great Void is embraced within. Through refinement and preservation, emptiness and purity arise; when emptiness and purity arise, the turbid also becomes clear. Spirit emerges from emptiness, and numinosity arises from clarity. One attains the celestial images and responds to ghosts and spirits, the myriad things of yin and yang. The subtle mechanism is fully awakened. The Dao of the Perfected is thus to refine emptiness and numinosity while cleansing dullness and turbidity.

**Chapter on Qi in Emptiness Penetrating Responses**
Qi is the master of images, possessing both clear and turbid aspects. The clear is the primordial of ascent; the turbid is the foundation of generation. Without the turbid, form cannot arise; without the clear, the true cannot be realized. Those who attain the clear become yang-perfected and empty, thus able to respond to things—emerging from death and entering life, transforming form and altering proximity. This is the result of qi’s emptiness and numinosity. To refine it, one must first empty the heart and nurture qi, unify thoughts and stabilize spirit, allowing qi to circulate constantly. When circulation becomes numinous, it penetrates and responds to the myriad things. Spiritual transformation then unfolds, and the mysteries of Heaven and Earth are fully grasped. This is the result of qi’s refinement into penetrating numinosity—its responses are boundless, its operations inexhaustible. This is called the Dao.

**Chapter on Essence’s Firmness Preserving Life**
Essence is the true. The true is primordial essence, the root of yin and yang, the foundation of life and death. To preserve life, one must firm essence. Firming essence means refining qi and nurturing spirit. When qi is stabilized and abundant, essence is fortified through primordial arts; when spirit is settled, life is preserved, and life endures through qi’s generation. Thus, the Perfected refine generative qi and secure true essence to preserve life and prolong years. The wise first nurture qi. When qi circulates and guards essence, essence naturally stabilizes. Externally, with fire’s operation, essence naturally firms. Qi gives rise to the source of generative qi, nurturing essence to form the mysterious embryo. Only when essence remains unshaken does qi flow constantly. This is the wondrous Dao.

**Chapter on Heaven and Earth Matching Form**
Heaven generates qi; Earth generates form. Life is governed by qi, and form is rooted in blood. Those who know Heaven nurture life; those who know Earth nurture qi. The Perfected guide qi upward from the cinnabar field, preventing its dispersion. It ascends from the right kidney, follows the waist to the lower feet, then rises along the back of the feet to the ribs, up the right arm to the shoulder well, enters the ear, ascends to the back of the brain, descends through the left ear, passes the shoulder well down the left arm, follows the left ribs, crosses the waist, descends the left foot, and returns to the cinnabar field. From midnight onward, stabilize the heart and regulate breath. When one senses qi penetrating the Flower Pool at the crown and hears flowing water in both ears, it is the time of true generative qi. This qi naturally traverses the meridians of Heaven and Earth’s union. Wherever it moves, press with the right hand on the left and the left hand on the right, allowing generative qi to flow without stagnation. Thus, Heaven and Earth match form, and form becomes one with Heaven and Earth. Daily progress is most excellent. After three thousand efforts, circulation becomes naturally unobstructed—one does not age or die, longevity is attained, and youthful countenance returns.

**Chapter on Yin and Yang’s Creation and Transformation**
Men receive the Dao of Heaven and obtain yang qi, generating the kidneys. Women receive the Dao of Earth and obtain yin qi, generating blood and the heart. Thus, men refine qi to perfection and preserve essence, while women refine blood to perfection and preserve spirit. Yin and yang’s creation and transformation differ, as do their practices. Men guard the kidneys and firm essence, refining qi to ascend along the spine to the Mud Pill, called "Returning to the Origin." Women guard the heart and nurture spirit, refining fire’s immobility so that qi from both breasts descends to the kidneys, then ascends to the Mud Pill, called "Transforming the True." After a hundred days of practice, men do not leak essence, qi becomes everlasting, and they return to youthful innocence, their spirits numinous. Women’s blood remains unmoved, spirit naturally settles, and they return to maidenhood, gathering the two meridians—one transforming milk, the other transforming blood—with myriad wondrous effects. With prolonged practice, hair regrows, breasts flatten, kidneys shift, and form changes.

**Chapter on Embryonic Breathing Naturally**
Those who wish to practice qi must first stabilize embryonic breathing. Embryonic breathing is natural breath—regulating and settling the breath count so that qi neither ascends nor descends, neither exits nor enters, naturally circulating within the chest through mouth and nose. Practice this at midnight, the time of qi’s generation. With time, after a hundred days, one can nurture qi and subdue breath. First, refine qi to penetrate both ears. Cover the ears with the left and right hands, and at midnight, guide qi with breath. Over time, it will naturally penetrate. When qi is unobstructed, breath need not exit through the ears, mouth, or nose—one can subdue breath. Once qi circulates, refine it at midnight, unifying primordial qi. Cover the ears with both hands, allowing qi to ascend, and massage to guide its reverse flow. Whether qi moves or rests within the skin is at one’s discretion.

**Chapter on Lead and Mercury’s Sprouting**
The South generates fire; fire generates the heart. The heart is cinnabar, and within cinnabar lies mercury, weighing four taels. The North generates water; water generates the kidneys. The kidneys are blue-gold, and blue-gold generates lead, weighing four taels. When the heart is still, mercury arises; when the kidneys are settled, lead arises. Lead and mercury ascend and descend, meeting in the golden crucible. Refined, they form the Great Elixir, the supreme medicine of transmutation. If the heart stirs, mercury cannot be seen—losing mercury dries cinnabar. The face becomes sallow and dull, the skin loses its rosy luster. If the kidneys stir, lead cannot be seen—losing lead dries blue-gold. The face turns dark and lackluster, the skin becomes dry and rough.

**On the Root of the Two Qi**
Why is this so? It is because the two qi have no root, and thus lead and mercury cannot arise. Without the discourse of the perfected ones, one’s efforts are but wasted labor. Therefore, the immortals refine qi to preserve the kidneys, and thus lead is often born; they settle the spirit to nourish the heart, and thus mercury often emerges. When lead and mercury flow ceaselessly, one endures long years in the world—this depends solely on the firmness, clarity, and purity of the root-source of the two qi.

**The Gate of the Perfected Matching the Sacred**
**The Spirit Transforms the Spirit**
Emptiness is its essence; stillness and illumination are its function. Yin and yang cannot be constrained by numbers, nor heaven and earth matched by things. All people possess this, yet it is obscured by the dust of worldly attachments and cannot be seen. Though from ancient times to the present, it cannot be named by methods nor attained by affairs, only the true person returns to simplicity and restores purity, abiding in clarity and silence to guard it. Its wondrous workings lie in making the dust-laden heart a chamber, transforming delusion into truth. The spirit arises naturally from emptiness, yet without form, it is near—mysteriously pervading the three realms, penetrating the root of life and death, and reaching the source of benefit and harm. This is the response of the spirit.

The spirit can transform all things without limit. When the spirit is spirit, it is spirit within me and becomes true. The spirit of heaven and earth is also my spirit; the spirit of the ten thousand images is also my spirit. What the spirit transforms depends on guarding stillness without movement: ascending true qi, overlapping the hands with the left pressing the right, and rubbing the crown of the head with the right hand. After three thousand efforts, the spirit will naturally emerge externally.

**Qi Transforms Qi**
Qi is most numinous—though a thousand classics and ten thousand treatises exist, only visualization and massage are its true application. The Great Compassionate True Sage follows the natural course: qi is most numinous, moving as the heart wills, and should be practiced constantly. Yet the human heart is fickle, and qi becomes stagnant; sorrow and thought cause blockage, while joy and pleasure lead to dissipation—both lose the original meridian. Thus, the true person refines qi to make it whole, beginning with the mind’s intent and ultimately attaining it naturally.

It arises from the cinnabar field, turning like a skin bag, circulating through the three palaces. Formerly, three speeds—fast, moderate, and slow—were distinguished as the three vehicles to ascend to the mud-pill palace. Yet the true secret does not require this! Only by making qi whole and firm, first through extreme effort to achieve circular turning, then having another person use both hands to press upward from the waist to the neck, will the qi naturally pass. Then, swallow the fluid of the Flower Pool forty-nine times, and the true qi will become firm and whole. Further nurturing and transforming this qi into the true is called: *qi transforms qi*—thus one becomes a true immortal.

**Essence Transforms Essence**
Preserving essence lies in refining qi; only when qi is upright can essence be firm. When essence is firm and secure, then it can be refined. From ancient times to the present, people have known only how to refine qi, not the method of refining true essence. The true person refines essence by securing it firmly; when essence has long remained unspilled and constantly stirs, only then is it refined with effort. The ninefold layers are tightly sealed.

Sitting, first visualize the three passes of the coccyx, tailbone, and perineum for three periods. Nine breaths of qi merge with essence below the navel, like a hairy ball endlessly turning. Refining essence occurs at the zi and wu hours, performing three hundred and sixty efforts each. After ten days, true essence transforms naturally, seizing the union of yin and yang, reversing and returning qi and fluid. Over time, great benefit arises. Clasp the hands firmly, pressing the thumb against the center of the middle finger, and pull upward with force—even shaking will not cause leakage.

**Heaven and Earth Can Be Shifted**
Men receive more of heaven’s pure yang; women receive more of earth’s pure yin. The way of pure yang is easily accomplished; the way of pure yin is difficult to attain. The true person possesses the method to turn men into women and women into men—this is how qi is transformed. Women’s blood is abundant and qi weak, so they refine blood to preserve qi; men’s blood is weak and qi abundant, so they refine qi to preserve blood. Both men and women receive the upright qi of heaven and earth, and thus their wonders can be shifted.

Men refine original qi, settle the spirit, first guarding the heart as one, excluding external things, and freeing themselves from all methods to accumulate essence and nourish the spirit. Women refine blood, gathering the two breast meridians, pressing them with both hands, massaging the face upward, and reversing the flow of qi to transform it.

**Yin and Yang Enter the Grasp**
The left hand is yang in humans, internally governing the kidneys. At midnight, qi arises naturally from the kidneys, and the spirit descends from the heart. Clench the left hand without opening it, close the left eye without looking, and visualize the spirit reaching the kidneys, emerging below the left eye and into the left hand. After three hundred and sixty efforts, open it.

At noon, qi descends naturally from the heart, and the spirit ascends from the kidneys. Clench the right hand without opening it, close the right eye without looking, and visualize the spirit reaching the heart, emerging below the right eye and into the right hand. After three hundred and sixty efforts, open it. Practicing thus for three thousand days, one can perceive matters a thousand miles away—heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, stars and constellations, grasses and trees—nothing is unknown in number, nothing is unknown in numinosity. Even the unfathomable matters of the human heart can be attained.

**Fetal Breathing and Exhalation-Inhalation**
First regulate the breath to be neither exhaled nor inhaled, naturally firm and secure. Constantly rinse with the true essence of the Flower Pool. After three thousand efforts, fetal breathing is achieved, and the fluid becomes a mysterious pearl. It can be exhaled and then inhaled again—not only prolonging life but also closing the tailbone to refine the true and enter the wondrous gate, hearing the perfection of true essence. The mysterious pearl of fetal breathing, over time, naturally congeals and ascends from below to the mud-pill palace. If unbroken, one attains longevity.

**Lead and Mercury Reveal the Treasure**
True essence generates lead; lead generates yellow blossoms. Settling the spirit generates mercury; mercury generates the mysterious pearl. Mercury, through internal fluids, generates the mysterious pearl. When qi moves either upward or downward, endlessly revolving, over time one naturally feels the fluid being swallowed, and an object like a pearl descends. If it seems about to emerge, the fluid is drawn back, absorbed into the yellow center, and congeals—it can even form on the tongue.

Lead, through the circulation of qi, generates yellow blossoms. When qi neither ascends nor descends but turns to the left endlessly, over time the qi settles below the navel, and the urine excreted will be green.

The qi can naturally move in and out; when one wishes to exhale, the qi penetrates through. The color at the *Weilü* (tailgate) is golden-yellow, like cinnabar lead.

Those who refine lead and mercury to reveal the treasure are true persons.

**The Spirit Exits the Spirit Chapter**
Refining the spirit can allow one to exit the form. What is meant by refining the spirit? It refers to guarding the heart. Guarding the heart can only settle the spirit and prevent aging, but it does not allow the spirit to exit and transcend life. To exit the spirit and transcend life depends on the *yuan* (round) spirit. From ancient times to the present, people have only spoken of rounding the qi to preserve the true, but none have spoken of rounding the spirit to refine the true. To round the spirit and refine the true, one must first visualize the heart as the form of the bright moon, with a figure vaguely seated within. Refining it to perfection, it rises to the *Niwan* (muddy pellet) above and descends to the *Danhai* (elixir sea) below. Over time, a radiant light emerges from within the body, and following this light, one exits the body, leaving no physical form. In deep stillness, the natural state is achieved, and the spirit exits the spirit—hence it is called "the spirit exits the spirit."

**Qi Settles the Qi Chapter**
Preserving the true qi and refining it allows one to match the years of heaven and earth. The qi is the root of the Dao; the Dao arises from qi, and qi arises from emptiness and being. When the true qi remains unshaken, one can attain longevity. Qi circulates within the body, nourishing the entire form. Refining it begins at the lower *dantian*, where the qi generated at midnight is directed. The heart guides the qi’s movement with effort—raising the hands and pressing—until, over time, the skin glows with a red radiance, and the qi becomes upright and does not dissipate, thus becoming true.

**Essence, Spirit, and Qi Complete Chapter**
Those who cultivate the Dao must ensure the completeness of essence, spirit, and qi. When essence is complete, the ears are sharp and the skin is moist; when spirit is complete, the complexion is radiant and the eyes are clear; when qi is complete, the voice is resonant and the body is light. Those who cultivate the Dao and wish to possess all three must settle the heart and sever thoughts, internally abide in emptiness, circulate qi in ascent and descent without pause, preserve and secure the essence-fluid, and return it to the origin without leakage. First, rectify the heart, swallow seventy times, harmonize the fluids, and visualize the spirit at rest. The heart, like the bright moon, illuminates the body. The external qi does not move, but with great force, it ascends to the *Niwan*. Accumulating essence without leakage, it rises with the qi. Over time, one attains longevity, the nine orifices become luminous, and the four limbs grow strong.

**Concealing the Form and Obscuring the Edges Chapter**
Heaven and earth bestow form and qi; in life, one dwells in the world free from worldly attachments, and in death, one sheds the shell and severs worldly ties. While alive, one extinguishes the form and conceals it within the shadow; in death, one gathers the spirit and constructs the true—all through specific methods. To extinguish the form after death: on the winter solstice, at sunrise, face the sun and walk toward a pine-covered mountain in the east. Hold red *zhi* (lingzhi) in hand, and ghostly beings will surely come to greet you. Call out "Heavenly Wolf" seven times, and the ghost will draw black qi from behind you to cover your body. This dissolves the yin and leaves no shadow, rendering you invulnerable to spirits and ghosts. In death, the spirit gathers, the spirit does not scatter, and the constructed essence remains unshaken.

**Commanding Spirit and Spirits Chapter**
Spirits and ghosts arise from humans. Those who are upright and just become spirits; those who are depraved and licentious become ghosts. Those who cultivate the true and wish to command them must first rectify their own spirit, projecting its light beyond the body. Naturally, extraordinary beings will be driven before you, whether to send them off or restrain them—all according to your command.

**Equalizing Old and Young Chapter**
That the old decline and the young thrive is the common principle. Yet the old may regain vigor, and the young may weaken—this is due to the dual consumption of the single qi. The true person equalizes them through method: the old regain vigor, and the young grow stronger. Those whose qi has declined and wish to strengthen it should ingest the *Nine Immortals’ Great Fluid* method. This Dao refines qi, settles the spirit, and stabilizes the body, pacifying the eighty-one true fluids within. If the fluid is not sweet at first, over time it will become sweet. The young naturally find it sweet and guide the qi with their hands from the heart down to the kidneys. Within seven days, the old will become like infants.

**Long Life and Immortality Chapter**
To live without dying is called long life. To die without dying is long life—this is achieved by refining while alive. To not die is to return to life. Those who desire long life must seek evergreen medicines, such as the leaves and seeds of pine and cypress. Refining the *Tai Lu* elixir is achieved by settling the heart and refining the spirit. To obtain the medicine of immortality, ingest the three yellows: *dihuang* (rehmannia), *huangjing* (polygonatum), and *ganju* (chrysanthemum). Refining the *Tai Yi* elixir is achieved by guarding the kidneys and refining qi.

**The Supreme Mystery Treasure Canon, Volume One, Concludes**
**Gate of Refining the Ordinary to Perfect the True**

**Chapter on Lightening the Bones**
Bones are the congealed qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, formed and transformed from the womb. They grow and nourish through the surging qi, changing little in youth but greatly in old age. Within the bones lies marrow, which flows and transforms into essence, serving as the root and origin of the entire body. Sinews and vessels interpenetrate, and the body’s movement and stillness all depend on a single qi to nourish and flourish. When qi and blood are strong and abundant, the bones become light, for the blood nourishes, uplifts, and impels them. When qi and blood decline, the bones grow heavy and the marrow withers—this is called "bone withering and essence exhausted," leading to death.

The cultivation of the true person begins with refining the blood, circulating it with the qi to nourish the entire body. Next, refine the bones to transform them; over time, spiritual penetration is achieved. Refining the heart to be without obstruction yields a clear spring, where steaming and pent-up essence permeates and circulates, transforming the blood into white jade. The Dao of long life fundamentally lies herein.

**Chapter on Refining Qi to Perfect Roundness**
The arising of qi has its correspondences, measures, forms, and principles. Thus, at midnight when the original qi is born, the two ears hear sounds like wind and rain; in those of great attainment, it is like the ringing of bells and chimes. This correspondence occurs precisely at the midpoint of the *zi* hour. Those who cultivate for a long time, closing their eyes and gazing upward, see the light of stars and constellations in their various forms. Moving the qi from below and revolving it, it not only ascends from the *Weilü* through the spine to the *Niwan* and descends, but also penetrates the nine orifices, circulating through the four limbs and beneath the skin, traversing the entire body—this is called "qi perfected in roundness." With prolonged movement, it reverses and ascends, becoming true quiescence—this is the true settling of qi. The movement and stillness of qi are called the essential mystery. When qi moves, there is everlasting peace; when qi is still, the spirit responds. Where true qi flows, the skin becomes lustrous, the nine orifices unobstructed, and the four limbs light and agile. Over time, there is no blood beneath the skin, only white fat.

**Chapter on Generating Spirit Water**
The arising of spirit water is not the fluid of the *Huachi* but the water of true qi’s nourishment and irrigation. In the north lies the Dark Sea, and within it is born the Dark Turtle. The Dark Turtle exhales true qi, which transforms into spirit water, and spirit water generates the kidneys. Thus, spirit water is the root and origin of qi, entering and exiting through human breath—one exhalation extends an inch, one inhalation draws in an inch. If one speaks little, thinks little, and moves little, an inch is generated in an hour. Sleeping for an hour also generates an inch, though in dreams the ethereal and spiritual may still labor. By day, be free of thoughts and settled, guarding the flow; by night, be dreamless and still in contemplation to generate it. Those who cultivate now sit upright in focused contemplation at midnight, inhaling from the Celestial Pond above and surging the earthly veins below. With prolonged practice, essence and fluid become inexhaustible—the Dao of long life and immortality begins here. Inhaling from the Celestial Pond irrigates the Winding River; surging the Earthly Gate eliminates hunger and thirst. One can then nourish the hundred vessels, transforming the ordinary body.

**Chapter on Moving True Fire**
True fire is not the fire of the heart. In the north lies water, and within water fire is born—fire arises from the yin cavern of the north, its light illuminating the Great Yang. It is obtained through a specific method: curve both hands and feet tightly, clenching them to direct force inward. Circle the waist, crossing to meet below the cinnabar field. The fire moves like the tortoise and snake, coiling upward and spiraling downward, rising like flames. Naturally emerging from the kidneys, it ascends along the spine, follows the Wind Mansion, rises through the neck, enters the mouth, exits the nose, penetrates the Heavenly Gate, and enters the *Niwan*. Naturally, it feels warm as if pressed by fire, causing sweat to drip forth. With long practice, one attains long life and immortality, eventually ascending in flight. All other confirmations are the wonders of immortals.

**Chapter on the Infant Emerging from the Womb**
The refinement of the Great Yang on the left gives rise to the dragon and generates the infant, for water engenders wood. Wood is the child of water, and the qi of water flows and transmits into water—thus, the Azure Dragon is the qi of wood. The Azure Dragon bears the true original qi of the Great One, becoming the womb of the infant. Through wood, it moves to the spleen, called the Yellow Dame. The Yellow Dame, through nurturing and the restraint of wood, gives birth to the infant, who is borne by azure light, its body suffused with azure radiance. Ordinary people know only the work of visualization but not the marvel of exerting effort. By clenching firmly and directing force upward through the four limbs, one will naturally know the great mystery.

**Chapter on the Maiden Generating Splendor**
The refinement of the Great Yin on the right gives rise to the tiger and generates the maiden, for metal engenders water. Metal is the mother of water, and the qi of metal flows and transmits into water—thus, the White Tiger is the qi of metal. The White Tiger bears the true qi of the One, becoming the womb of the maiden. Through metal, it moves to the kidneys, where myriad metals give birth to the child. Directing force through the four limbs and hundred vessels, moving up and down, left and right, one loosens the robe, clenches firmly, and guards the heart without wavering—this is the true Dao. The body externally generates azure and red lights, their brilliance separating the four images of metal and wood. Wood engenders fire, metal engenders water; the Azure Dragon gently guides fire with qi, the White Tiger forcefully guides water with qi. Practicing thus will naturally yield verification. This is the secret essence of true immortals, greatly efficacious. When the spirit reaches the heart, after seven days one obtains extraordinary responses.

**Chapter on the Union of Yin and Yang**
Within yin lies yang, called the supreme essence, known as Moon Splendor. Within yang lies yin, called the supreme numen, known as Sun Essence. The supreme yang of the north generates the kidneys, which are water; within water lies yang fire. The supreme yin of the south generates the heart, which is fire; within fire lies yin water. They mutually come and go, their intermingling qi generating spiritual beings. True fire generates lead, true water generates mercury; when lead and mercury unite, long life is attainable. Yet people today do not fathom this mystery—how can they mutually prepare? Thus, they see no verification.

If the upper essence ascends to the Flower Pool and the lower rises through the earth meridians, the heart descends to the central region while qi surges to the spleen’s origin—when the two qi meet, they naturally become like wine. Drinking to satiety, one feels unobstructed and joyful, the hundred vessels harmonized, the myriad spirits inwardly intoxicated. Bones grow firm, marrow congeals, and one may return to the state of infancy. Practicing this over time, one generates the true body, transforms form, and communes with heaven and earth, becoming universally efficacious—such is its wonder.

**Refining the Mortal to Enter the Gate of Spirit**
**Chapter on the Spirit-Body Generating Radiance**
The spirit-body, when primordial qi gathers in truth, stabilizes the spirit and nourishes the essence. Refining the spirit-body over time, the refinement of the spirit-body eventually generates radiance. For qi responds to essence, essence to spirit, and spirit to the body—these three marvels require one another. With circular movement above and below, fire refines qi to ascend, penetrating the hundred vessels and permeating the hundred orifices. At night, one may inwardly perceive five-colored clouds encircling the body, while others see one as if enveloped in flame. The secret lies in silently circulating qi, which consolidates essence; essence solidifies to preserve spirit, and spirit, in its numinous stability, naturally emits light beyond the body, spiritually pervading the eight directions. The qi of wind and atmosphere naturally revolves unceasingly, encircling the body to form a halo of light, which over time becomes five-colored clouds. The ascent to the celestial realm is thus attained.

**Chapter on the Five Viscera Illuminated**
The five viscera are the source of the five phases. Once the five phases are refined, what then guards the qi? What guards the form? Rotating left and right, circulating qi without cease, over time they interpenetrate—hunger and thirst vanish, and there is no longer distinction between constructive and protective qi. Qi and blood merge, spirit and essence interflow—such are the subtle words of the silent transformation of immortals. The secret lies in circulating qi as the foundation, guarding the heart as paramount, aided by the clenched fists, and culminating in lifting the Mud-Pill Palace. First clench the fists to guard the heart, and while guarding the heart, circulate qi. When ascending, direct it to the upper Cinnabar Field, forcefully propelling it as if lifting the four limbs. When the heart’s qi surges, the internal qi of the five viscera no longer remain separate. Not only does illness cease, but the five qi harmonize and nourish, flourishing with luminous clarity. Inward vision reveals them like five-colored glass—such is the verification. Practicing this over time, the light ascends to commune with the five stars.

**Chapter on the Four Limbs Internally Cleansed**
All people possess four limbs: externally, skin and flesh; internally, bones and blood. Cutting off stray thoughts, one becomes a true person. The true body’s ascent to the cloudy heavens begins with internally cleansing the four limbs. The method: sit upright, press the soles of the feet together, and join the palms until warm. This unites the five viscera—hand qi first meets the spine, foot qi first meets the waist. Shaking the body up and down, sweat emerges from the four limbs, and the myriad diseases dissolve of themselves. The hundred evils cannot invade—how could sores or ulcers arise? How could numbness or scabies occur? Those who cultivate the Dao must first practice this to invigorate the qi!

**Chapter on the Three Palaces Illuminating the Yellow Path**
The Way of the Three Palaces Guarding the One originates from celestial perfection, transmitted by the Sovereign to the Yellow Emperor, its true essence closely guarded. Beginning from the lower Cinnabar Field, qi rises in circular motion to the soles of the feet, igniting fire to meet below the navel. Next, activating the middle Cinnabar Field, one guards a single stabilized spirit. Refining to the upper Cinnabar Field, one transports the jade essence downward, swallowing it into the Flower Pool, where true essence enters the heart. Practicing thus, the ears and eyes grow a myriad times more luminous. Below, it connects to the waist and kidneys; above, spirit-fire ascends. Thus, the Three Palaces possess the yellow luminous qi, called the Yellow Path. Practicing this over time, one ascends to the cloudy heavens, enjoys longevity without aging, and communes with the spiritually enlightened—only the Yellow Emperor first attained its entirety.

**Chapter on Precious Fire Entering the Cauldron**
Those who cultivate the Dao regard qi as metal and as the cauldron. The cauldron’s union lies below the spleen and above the waist. Within the cauldron is the elixir, formed when the two qi of Kan and Li unite in the spleen. Within the cauldron is water—primordial qi. Without fire, primordial qi cannot ascend. The fire that arises from below is the fire within the water of the Kan Palace. Precious fire is the yang within yin, the solar essence, the ascending radiance of the Great Yang Elixir. Its practice has a method: first swallow the true fluid of the Flower Pool three hundred and sixty times. Each day at sunrise, visualize solar essence and swallow it three hundred and sixty times. By midnight, one may ignite it to refine the Great Yang Elixir.

**Chapter on Elixir Radiance Responding to Fluid**
Refining the two spirits, the treasure of supreme yang, internally nourishes the hundred vessels and externally connects the nine orifices—then spirit-light emerges, its fluid flowing. Internally, a divine spring irrigates; externally, the qi of supreme harmony becomes fluid and sweat. The hundred diseases do not arise, the body grows light, and over time, luminous downy hair appears. Walking is like flying, climbing mountains and traversing perilous paths pose no obstacle, for the spiritually enlightened assist.

**Chapter on the Jade Spring Without Leakage**
The Jade Spring is the arising of true essence. Only those who cultivate truth over time attain it, possessing three requisites: first, the flow from the Mud-Pill Palace; second, the spirit-palace free of thought; third, the primordial origin firmly sealed. Essence perpetually generates, like water endlessly flowing from mountain valleys—what can shake or restrain it? It never exhausts, hence the Jade Spring is ever-moistening. The spring never ceases. The method lies in stabilizing the spirit and nourishing qi, ascending to the Mud-Pill Palace, and tightly sealing qi to prevent leakage.

**Refining the Mortal to Emerge from the Gate of Images**
**Chapter on Supplementing Spirit and Generating the Embryo**
Spirit is born from the embryo, the embryo from the mandate. When the embryo is born, spirit is born; when the mandate is allotted, spirit is complete. Form lives by qi, qi moves by spirit. Spirit fundamentally tends toward movement, qi fundamentally tends toward circularity. Yet through attachment to sensory forms, one gradually strays from the source, endlessly drifting—thus spirit suffers harm. Exerting the body harms spirit by three parts, exerting qi harms spirit by five parts, and exerting the mind harms spirit by seven parts. Bearing burdens and moving about is exerting the body; indulging in desires, sounds, and sights is exerting qi; contemplation, sorrow, and worry is exerting the mind.

**Where Spirit Suffers Harm**

The harm to spirit varies in depth; the Perfected should first know the Way of supplementing spirit. Only then can form be preserved and spirit stabilized—mere stillness and silence are not enough.

Take ginseng as medicine, refine qi through the Three Palaces, and govern it without disturbance. Regulate diet, adapt to cold and warmth, maintain regularity in daily life, neither bound by the Dao nor burdened by worldly customs—thus is the embryo of spirit attained.

The embryo of spirit means spirit returns to plain simplicity and is thereby nourished. Only then can one practice the Way of stabilizing spirit.

**Chapter on Supplementing the True Source of Qi**

To supplement qi is to secure the body and enrich life, to nurture the origin and preserve the true. Reduce contemplation and sever desires. For the weak, first use medicinal tonics such as Solomon’s seal. Next, practice methods to circulate the origin, preserve essence, and cultivate breath—when qi is strong and flourishing, the true source is born.

The true source is the wellspring of generative qi, the abode of life. In the great cultivation of the Dao, nothing surpasses this.

**Chapter on Soaring, Leaping, Ascending, and Climbing**

The Way of transcendent immortals and feathered transformation all arise from refining spirit. Those who can soar, leap, ascend heights, and scale perilous peaks do so through the body of spirit.

To strengthen sinews and vessels, fortify qi and vigor, and attain lightness and agility of body—when the body of spirit radiates brilliance, this has already been expounded in the preceding scripture.

To strengthen sinews and vessels: stabilize the mind and nourish blood. Lie supine while another presses and rubs, or self-massage. At midnight, regulate breath and visualize the Azure Dragon arising from the kidneys, coiling around the waist and limbs, ascending to the Gate of Heaven and Earth. Drink nine times from the Flowery Pond’s true fluid, and chant the invocation to the Azure Heavens seven times.

To fortify qi and vigor: preserve essence and qi. To attain lightness and agility: refine the Way of essence, qi, and spirit in their entirety.

**Chapter on the Great Yu’s Steps**

Of old, the Great Yu controlled the hundred spirits through the steps of heavenly years. The steps of heavenly years allow one to evade the three perils.

The three perils are the dangers of heaven, earth, and thunder; the dangers of mountains, rivers, and ghosts; and the dangers of birds, beasts, and venomous spirits. Those who cultivate the true must first master these steps. Ascending clouds and mist, treading the three realms, the host of immortals will attend and guard.

When ascending altars to sacrifice to heaven or entering mountains to traverse perilous paths: clench the teeth, close the eyes, and visualize the sun and moon. Take them in the left hand, let the right hand hang down. Raise the left hand to the south and north, clench the four fingers, extend the second finger, and step with the right foot toward the southeast, facing east.

Next, clench the right hand, step with the right foot toward the northeast, and face east. Those not within the three realms’ precepts must not step forth.

---

**Chapter on Measuring and Delivering Spirits**

The Perfected measures humans to deliver spirits, using methods to cultivate the true and commands to receive precepts. Wherever scriptures speak of fierce and malevolent ghosts, use commands to deliver them, elevating them to the rank of true officials.

First, fast and purify. Prepare a blue memorial and a clear petition. Open the three realms. Mix nine ounces of cinnabar with powdered silk to fashion the true form in blue and white, on a thousand sheets of square paper. Scatter and burn them beneath a great pine. If blue and white clouds appear above the pine, spirit beings will manifest. Address them and depart.

---

**Chapter on Penetrating the Spiritual and Entrusting Transformation**

Human true spirit is obscured by emotions, all depending on where spirit abides. Every person possesses spirit; it is emotions that obscure it. Only the Perfected can achieve spirit communication.

When people live, they dream of intercourse; when they die, their spirits transmit. In dreaming, they dream of human spirits; when spirit lodges, it temporarily transforms and lingers in the world.

When qi refinement is complete and spirit stabilized without disorder, one may open the Gate of Heaven and release spirit—thus can it penetrate. It may dwell in images or entrust itself to human form.

Those who entrust to human form often inhabit people whose spirits are disordered and qi depleted. Frequent encounters may cause inversion, or communion may occur in drunkenness.

---

**Chapter on Passing Beyond the Unfeeling**

Spirit follows human conduct; things transform through the true. Unfeeling things—such as strange waters and monsters—when approached by humans, may, if spirit penetrates, become numinous beings.

Today, many such exist in great mountains and rivers, relying on the power of the blessed courts of true immortals. They do no harm and often bring good fortune.

**The Gate of Cultivating Qi and Structuring Spirit**

**Chapter on the Wood Spirit Nurturing Spirit**
The subtlety of yin and yang gives rise to the transformations of the Five Phases, each possessing its true unity. The most numinous of beings are born in grotto-heavens and blessed lands; those who encounter them may become true immortals.

The spirit of wood is the *xialing*. When ingested according to method, it generates spirit clarity and lightens the four limbs. Grind *xialing* into powder, mix it with fresh pine needles, and boil with water until the *xialing* turns a translucent jade-green. Dry it in the sun, grind to a fine powder, and form into honeyed pills. Take three times daily, each the size of an acorn, with water at dawn. It unites with the spirit, prevents aging and hunger, and dispenses with the five flavors. After three hundred days of ingestion, the body grows blue-green fur and becomes impervious to cold and heat. Adding pear eliminates summer heat; adding duckweed dispels winter cold.

**Chapter on the Essence of Wood Nurturing Essence**
The essence of heaven and earth congeals into evergreen trees, their tender leaves and supple seeds able to generate essence, unblock the hundred vessels, and transform the mortal frame. Those growing in deep mountain valleys, in lofty and secluded places untouched by humans, may be harvested—such as the kernel of the cypress.

Pound the tender leaves thirty-six thousand times, mix with honey, and pack into a new bamboo tube. Boil with flowing mountain spring water until no bitterness remains, leaving only a sweet, pungent fragrance. Take a portion the size of a jujube with water at sunrise. After a hundred days, hunger ceases, essence becomes sealed—even if shaken, it does not leak. One becomes immune to cold and heat, perceives ghosts and spirits, and runs as swiftly as a galloping horse. With essence and qi preserved, the hundred illnesses are dispelled. Over time, the four limbs grow blue-green fur, and the ears and nose turn crimson.

**Chapter on the Qi of Wood Nurturing Qi**
The east generates wind, wind generates wood, and wood generates the myriad things—thus it can generate qi. The qi of wood is the *gouqi* (wolfberry).

The essence of the four seasons resides in different parts: harvest the leaves in spring, flowers in summer, fruit in autumn, and roots in winter. Modern practitioners gather them according to the season, and ingestion yields ten responses.

The *True Person’s Secret Formula of the Grotto-Heaven* states: Harvest in each of the four seasons, wait until the cycle is complete, then select, wash, and chop. Mix with glutinous rice, steam in a ceramic vessel—one *jin* of medicine to one *dou* of rice. Begin before the Winter Solstice, and remove at the Awakening of Insects. It will turn a lustrous black-gold. After a hundred days of ingestion, the beard and temples become black as lacquer, as if one were a maiden. Walking becomes swift as flight, and climbing mountains or fording perilous terrain all day brings no fatigue. The skin grows lustrous, the eyes radiant with spirit light. Minimizing thought and extinguishing desire is paramount.

**Chapter on the Flower of Wood Refining the Bones**
The spirit of the Great Void, the most refined essence, descends into the Five Phases and gathers at the center—its qi is the pepper.

It receives the Five Phases and unblocks the nine orifices, transforming the sinews and nourishing the bone marrow. Its ceaseless effervescence refines mortal bones into those of a true immortal. With prolonged ingestion, one feels as if insects are crawling within the bones, yet the marrow remains unexhausted even in old age. At death, the sinews do not decay.

Take only the red pepper, discarding the white skin and black seeds, to a measure of one *jin*. Mix with refined *fengxiang* resin and steam in a double boiler for seven days until moist enough to form pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take daily with water on an empty stomach. After seven hundred days, one communes with the spirit luminaries, the eyes emit spirit light, and the skin feels as hard as bone when pressed. In darkness, one can see, and the path to longevity and transcendence begins here.

**Chapter on the Five Zhi Communing with Spirit Luminaries**
The *zhi* are the utmost numina of heaven and earth, born of the harmonious qi of yin and yang. The five-colored *zhi* can replenish the true qi of the Five Phases.

True persons gather the five *zhi* to refine the elixir, whose efficacy enables communion with spirit luminaries, transformation into empty space, and the gathering of spirit to perfect the true.

Boil each of the five-colored *zhi* with honey for seven days and nights, then remove and ingest on an auspicious day, washing them down with a little wine to aid their potency. After seven days, one perceives celestial phenomena at noon, rides tigers and leopards, summons clouds and dragons, and commands ghosts and spirits. If fresh *zhi* are obtained, boil and consume them with wine and honey—their effects are the same.

**Chapter on the Immortal’s Longevity Staff**
Immortals gather green bamboo seven *chi* in length with twelve nodes. Fill it with a mixture of realgar wine and petroleum, seal both ends with honey, then wrap it in twenty-four layers of paper mulberry leaves. Cover lightly with yellow earth, and atop this, pile a *dou* of wheat bran. Burn without allowing the flames to flare—only let it steam until thoroughly permeated. Naturally, a golden radiance will appear. This staff can strike down a hundred demons, command ten thousand spirits, and ensure that wherever one wields it, one remains free from death and illness, guarded by spirit luminaries.

**The Gate of Cultivating Qi and Augmenting Spirit**

**Chapter on the Old Man’s Wooden Horse**
True persons use the wooden horse to aid the aged and infirm, sparing them labor. The elixir is made from equal parts frankincense, myrrh, and *yangqishi* (actinolite), formed into pills. Take seven with wine, and after walking ten *li*, bathe in a decoction of *mutong*, paper mulberry fruit, and pepper. After seven days, one runs as swiftly as a galloping horse, and climbing or fording brings no fatigue—hence the name "wooden horse," for one moves with ease as if mounted.

**Chapter on the Herb Spirit Generating Spirit**
Herbs are the harmonious qi of yin and yang, nurtured by rain and dew. They possess sentience, benefit humans, and enhance qi. Among herbs, the most numinous is *huangjing* (Solomon’s seal), which, when ingested, can generate spirit to become spirit.

Refine it according to method: steam and sun-dry nine *liang* of *huangjing* nine times, then grind into a paste. Mix with one *liang* of indigo, and simmer in a copper vessel over a double boiler until it resembles jade. Form into pills the size of cherries. Take one pill daily with water on an empty stomach. After seven days, the spirit is complete; after forty-nine days, the true spirit is born. When the true spirit is born, closing one’s eyes is like sitting in a chamber.

**Chapter on the Essence of Herbs Generating Essence**
Among herbs are beings of essence and numina that grant longevity, generate essence, replenish marrow, and restore what has been exhausted. The essence of herbs is the sweet chrysanthemum.

**The Lower Scroll of the Treasured Canon of the Great Mystery concludes here**

Obtain four *liang* of chrysanthemum flowers and four *liang* of clear wine; boil once, then remove and sun-dry into powder. Take one *fangcun* spoonful each time with clear water. After seven days, essence will be generated without end.

**Chapter on Herbal Qi Generating Qi**
The qi of Heaven and Earth divides through yin and yang. The qi of yin and yang becomes the myriad things. Among herbs, the one that most fully embodies this qi is *dihuang*. Consuming it nourishes the blood and vessels, strengthens the teeth, darkens the beard and hair, and imparts luster to the four limbs. Each person’s response to its consumption varies. When harvesting *dihuang* in abundance, steam it until thoroughly soft, grind to extract the paste, and mix with one-tenth its weight in sea salt. Do not administer to women, lest reckless blood flow cause illness. For men suffering from deficiency and weakness, take seven pills the size of hemp seeds with clear water. After seven days, qi will flourish like that of an infant, yielding great benefit.

**Chapter on Herbs as Elixirs for Transcending the World**
The Most High possesses seventy-two kinds of elixirs, yet only the Nine-Flowered Herb Spirit Elixir can deliver one from the world, serving as the true immortal’s path—does this not arise from method? The essence of Heaven is *tianmendong*; the essence of Earth is *dihuang*; the essence of the sun is *gouqi*; the essence of the moon is pine pollen; the essence of yin is *yuanzhi*; the essence of yang is ginseng; the essence of mountains is *jusheng*; the essence of water is lotus rhizome; the essence of humanity is chrysanthemum. Take equal parts of these nine herbs, selecting only the finest and purest. Pound them thoroughly, mix with hundred-herb dew, wrap in cloth, and bind tightly with kudzu vine. Steam with five *dou* of rice until the rice is cooked, then remove. At night, spread the herbs under the bright moon, and by dawn’s light, sun-dry them. Grind into powder and form into honeyed pills. Take one pill the size of a jujube daily with water. Within seven days, one may transcend the world, the heart naturally connecting with the divine. Hunger and thirst vanish, bones become firm, the body light—one may then dwell in the mountains.

**Chapter on Herbs for Renewing the Flesh**
For those whose flesh has long been afflicted by illness, or whose qi, blood, and bones have withered, the true person revives them with the numinous herb for renewing flesh. This numinous herb is gathered as follows: on *jiayi* days of the east, harvest *fangfeng*; on *gengxin* days, sun-dry it. On *bingding* days, harvest mugwort; on *ren gui* days, sun-dry it. On *gengxin* days of the west, harvest sweet flag; on *jiayi* days, sun-dry it. On *ren gui* days of the north, harvest chrysanthemum; on *bingding* days, sun-dry it. On *wuji* days, place the four herbs in a mortar and pound three thousand six hundred times into powder. Form into pills the size of beans using lotus rhizome juice. Take thrice daily. After seven days, the flesh will be free of illness, all malevolent forces will retreat, and noxious qi will not intrude. The ordinary becomes true; the aged becomes youthful. Only those who encounter the Dao may be taught this method.

**Chapter on Herbs for Opening the Nine Orifices**
Humans possess nine orifices: when unobstructed, one becomes a true person; when blocked, one becomes a base ghost. If the nine orifices are not open, one cannot discern good from evil, right from wrong, or deviance from uprightness. Thus, the way of the true person first delivers others by opening the nine orifices, and the herbs for this are divinely wondrous. Use sweet flag with nine nodes per inch, grind into powder, and form into pills with paper mulberry juice. Take seven pills the size of mung beans with wine daily. After a hundred days, one will immediately perceive responses, remain sleepless without fatigue, and discern colors, fragrances, and flavors with ease—what others cannot grasp, one will comprehend first.

**Chapter on the Five Phases Elixir of Herbs**
Among herbs are the five phases. The true person gathers them to form an elixir, which, when consumed, internally harmonizes the five phases, naturally gathering essence, qi, and spirit. The herbs are as follows: the numinous herb of the east is ginseng; of the south, *wanpu*; of the center, *dihuang*; of the west, *jusheng*; of the north, *huangjing*. Combine these five elixirs, add water, and steam for three days and nights. Remove, sun-dry, and grind into powder. Refine pine resin into pills the size of tung seeds. Take seven pills daily with warm water. After seven days, true qi is achieved: dreams and visions become spiritually attuned, qi and blood flourish, the body’s sinews and bones strengthen, essence solidifies, and spirit stabilizes.

**Chapter on Consuming Water**
The true person consumes water to augment true qi and primal origin. There are methods for abstaining from grains, treating illness, expelling malevolence, replenishing qi, and calming the body—each possesses wondrous efficacy in connecting with the divine.

For abstaining from grains: when dwelling in the mountains or barren lands, wishing to cease eating grains, consume water to nourish the spleen, preventing emaciation or weakness. First, visualize the spleen’s origin as yellow qi swirling around it, then direct the fire’s power downward to penetrate the bones. Hold the breath for three hundred sixty counts, clench the fists, and swallow true saliva three hundred sixty times before consuming water. Pour half a cup of water toward the sun, holding it in the left hand. With the *yaksha* mudra holding the water, the right hand clenched into a fist, face east and silently recite the *Qingyuan* incantation. Visualize the water flowing into the heart, transforming into white light, which overflows into the spleen, turning it to stone. Recite urgently: *"Hasten as the law commands!"* Seven times, then blow into the water. Visualize a white rabbit entering the water, and consume it at dawn each day. After seven days, hunger ceases. Initially, consume a small amount of congee for several days; if the water’s power is insufficient, eat jujubes and chestnuts sparingly to aid spiritual strength.

For treating illness: whether the affliction is one’s own or another’s, have the person consume the water to attain peace. With the right hand’s three fingers, hold a cup of water, face north, and recite: *"Primal Husband Envoy, Golden-Headed *Luo* Spirit."* Seven times, and the water will boil and overflow. Those without the Dao’s qi may still observe purity and precepts, though the water may not boil—only a hint of qi will arise. The true person generates fire from water.

For expelling malevolence: when ghosts, spirits, or spectral beings harm a person, or when myriad illusions and deceptions arise, one may rectify them. With the left hand’s three fingers, hold a cup of water, face south, and recite: *"Great Compassionate Divine Head, Red-Haired Primal Spirit."* Seven times, then sprinkle the water toward the malevolent entity using a willow branch to dispel it.

Should another suffer affliction, sprinkle the water upon them or bid them drink—thus shall they awaken.

To replenish qi: when the true person aids one weakened and depleted, let them drink the divine water infused with true qi. Pour half from a cup of water, hold it with the right hand’s three fingers, face south, and draw in the true yang qi seven breaths. Visualize seven red crows flying into the water; then recite: *"Drink the fire—a divine flame enters my sacred spring. True qi flourishes, granting longevity of ten thousand years. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statute decrees!"* Seven times, then blow into the water. Before drinking, close the eyes and meditate quietly, sipping slowly; even illness shall be cured.

For purifying the body: when the body and mind of a person are swept away by desire, mired in defilement, and entangled in the dust of the world, the true person, distant in celestial wisdom, reflects upon this. Thus, the true person teaches that in all matters—whether performing true sacrifices or bathing—one must first purify the body. After washing, compose body and mind, take a cup of water, and beneath the stars and moon, face heaven and pray: *"Celestial numen, undefiled; earthly numen, unshaken. Swiftly, swiftly, as the star’s decree commands!"* Seven times, then blow into the water. Next, sit upright facing due south for a long while—thus shall the response manifest. In all practices, invoke the visions of the divine spirits.

**Ascending Clouds Chapter**
The true person fathoms the source of life and death, comprehends the Dao of the True One, refines qi to perfect authenticity, and stabilizes the spirit in emptiness and unity. Over time, the fire-qi naturally solidifies, and the spirit steadies itself. When qi is consolidated, it revolves in perfect harmony; when the spirit is settled, it attains spiritual communion. Knowing the appointed time of life and death, one grasps the subtleties of transcending the world. Thus, one who thoroughly understands life and death is called a true person; one who departs death and enters life is called an immortal.

To discern the appointed time of death—should the count not be exceeded—on the Three Primes night, beneath a bright moon by a flowing stream, take a bamboo branch and burn an ounce of pine resin in an incense burner. Use the bamboo to waft the smoke across the water; if the smoke above the water does not swirl into a perfect circle, death shall come that year. Point the bamboo branch toward the moon to divine: each shadow cast marks a month; thus shall the day be determined, and further, the hour. Once the hour is known, carry ghost-arrows and ginseng upon the person. Circulate the two qi in perfect rotation, sit in silent meditation within a proper chamber, abandon medicinal aids, sever all thoughts, brush away worldly concerns, and ascend through the Gate of Heaven—naturally, a white light shall appear atop the head, visible to all. The wondrous Dao of the spirit must not be transmitted beyond the world.

*Thus concludes the Lower Scroll of the* **Treasure Canon of the Great Mystery.**
