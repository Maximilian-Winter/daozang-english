### **The Record of Immortals from the *Essential Teachings on the Golden Elixir* by Master Shangyang**

**The Lord Emperor of Donghua**
Surnamed Wang, his generation and given name are unknown; some say his name was Xuanfu. He attained the Dao of Laozi, later concealing himself on Kunlun Mountain, then dwelling in the Purple Palace Grotto-Heaven of Wutai Mountain, styling himself the Lord of Lesser Yang. In the Niyang Grotto of Zhongnan Mountain, he transmitted the Dao to Zhongli Quanzhen. Born on the fifteenth day of the sixth month, he ascended on the sixteenth day of the tenth month.

**The Lord Emperor of Zhengyang**
Surnamed Zhongli, named Quan, styled Yunfang, with the sobriquet Master Zhengyang. A native of Xianyang in Jingzhao. Served as a general under the Han, but due to military setbacks, he entered Zhongnan Mountain, where he encountered the Lord of Lesser Yang and received the Supreme Dao. He concealed himself on Yangjiao Mountain in Jinzhou. Upon achieving the Dao, the Heavenly Emperor bestowed upon him the title *True Person of the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate*. He bound his hair with twin stars, wore oak leaves, and called himself the *Unfettered Wanderer of the World*. His poems circulated in the world. Later, by the Li River, he transmitted the Dao to Lü Chunyang. Born on the fifteenth day of the fourth month, he ascended on the eighteenth day of the fifth month.

**The Lord Emperor of Chunyang**
Surnamed Lü, named Yan, styled Dongbin, with the sobriquet Master Chunyang. His ancestors resided in Zhaoxian Village, Yongle Town, Manzhe County, Xijing Henan Prefecture (present-day Fan County, Puzhou). Born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month at the Hour of Si in the fourteenth year of the Tianbao era (755 CE) of the Tang, though some say he was born in the Bingzi year of the Zhenyuan era under Emperor Dezong. His father served as prefect of Haizhou, and Lü settled there with his family. Through the imperial examinations, he was appointed magistrate of Dehua in Jiangzhou.

Later, wandering through Mount Lu and roaming along the Li River, he encountered Zhengyang, who transmitted the Dao to him, and to this day remains in the world. The Heavenly Emperor issued an edict appointing him as the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Immortals. On the twentieth day of the fifth month, he composed a poem upon receiving the edict, containing the line: *"To rectify the celestial registers of divine immortals."* The world thereafter took this day as his ascension. His collection of poems and lyrics, *The Complete Works*, circulates in the world. He transmitted the Dao to Hai Chan and Chongyang.

Born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, he ascended on the twentieth day of the fifth month.

**The Lord Emperor of Hai Chan**
Surnamed Liu, named Cao, styled Zongcheng, with the sobriquet Master Hai Chan, later changing his name to Xuanying. A native of Yanshan. He served in the Liao court, rising to the rank of prime minister. Upon encountering Chunyang, he immediately resigned his ministerial seal, feigning madness to wander far in Qinzhou. Chunyang transmitted to him the alchemical Dao, whereupon he composed a poem: *"I cast aside a fiery household of three thousand souls, / Dismissed the gate guards of a hundred myriad homes."* Later, having attained the Dao, he concealed his traces between Mount Zhongnan and Mount Taihua. He transmitted the Golden Elixir to Dong Ningyang and Zhang Ziyang.

Born on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month, he ascended on the fifteenth day of the sixth month.

**The Lord Emperor of Chongyang**
Surnamed Wang, named Zhongfu, styled Yunqing. He later changed his name to Shixiong, styled Dewei. After entering the Dao, he altered his name to Zhe, styled Zhiming, with the sobriquet Master Chongyang. A native of Dawei Village, Xianyang. Born in the second year of the Zhenghe era (1112 CE) of Emperor Huizong of the Song.

On the twenty-second day of the twelfth month in the *renchen* year, at Ganhe Town in Zhongnan County, he encountered Pure Yang, who transmitted oral instructions to him. Thereupon he composed forty-eight poems beginning with verses on their first meeting. The following year, *gengchen*, he met Pure Yang again at Liquan and further received the Dao of the Golden Elixir. He then took up cave-dwelling practice, naming his abode the "Tomb of the Living Dead." Later, he built a hut alongside He Yuchan and Li Lingyang. Initially, Shi Chuhou, Liu Tongwei, and Yan Chuchang successively received the Dao from him. Later, he burned his hut and journeyed east beyond the Pass, arriving at Ninghai Prefecture, where he transmitted the Golden Elixir’s Dao to Dan Yang. He also instructed Qiu Changchun, Tan Changzhen, Sun Bu’er, Wang Yuyang, Liu Changsheng, and Hao Taigu. He then entrusted the five secret scrolls transmitted by Pure Yang entirely to these seven disciples.

His works *Complete Anthology of the Quanzhen School (Former and Latter Collections)*, *The Concealed Light Collection*, *The Cloudy Peaks Collection*, and *The Ten Transformations of Pear-Division* circulate in the world. He ascended on the twenty-second day of the twelfth month and the fourth day of the first month.

**Perfected Lord Dan Yang**
Surnamed Ma, named Yu, styled Xuanbao, with the sobriquet Master Dan Yang. Earlier named Congyi, styled Yifu. A native of Ninghai Prefecture. Born in the first year of the Tianhui era (1123 CE) of Emperor Taizong of Jin, corresponding to the fifth year of the Xuanhe era of Emperor Huizong of Song. Born on the twentieth day of the fifth month. His family was wealthy, earning him the epithet "Ma Half-the-Prefecture." He married Lady Sun and fathered three sons: Tingzhen, Tingrui, and Tinggui.

In the seventh year of the Dading era (1167 CE), *dinghai*, Chongyang arrived, and upon seeing Ma eat a melon starting from the stem, the Master found it strange and inquired. Chongyang replied: *"Fragrance emerges from within the foul; sweetness arises from the bitter."* Ma further asked: *"What is the Dao called?"* Chongyang answered: *"Where the Five Phases do not reach, before father and mother were born."* Thereupon Ma invited him home to receive instruction.

In the *wuzi* year (1168 CE), he entrusted family affairs to his three sons and left home. Chongyang transmitted to him the five secret scrolls of the Golden Elixir received from Pure Yang, along with oral instructions. Ma then shaved his head into three topknots and cultivated the Dao to perfection. Through the *Ten Transformations of Pear-Division*, he endured much hardship. Among those seeking the Dao at the time were Li Dacheng, Zhao Penglai, and Han Qingfu, but only Song Piyun grasped the essence of the Master’s Golden Elixir and thus attained the Dao first.

His works *The Gold and Jade Collection*, *The Gradual Awakening Collection*, *The Practice and Transformation Collection*, *The Attainment of the Dao Collection*, *The Perfect Completion Collection*, *The Subtle Essence Collection*, and recorded sayings all circulate in the world. Among the Seven Perfected, he was the foremost teacher. Born on the twentieth day of the fifth month, he ascended on the twenty-second day of the twelfth month.

Born on the first day of the third month in the first year of the Jin Taizong reign (13th year of the *guimao* cycle). In middle age, he suffered from wind-bi syndrome and became a disciple of Chongyang. Each morning, Chongyang would pour the leftover water from his ablutions for him to wash his face; after a long time, his illness was cured, and he was then instructed in the Dao. Due to the weight of his past karmic deeds, he once encountered a drunken ruffian who struck him, breaking his teeth and drawing blood, yet he did not reproach him. Danyang, upon hearing of this, said: "One blow dissolves the karma of many lives." Upon attaining the Dao, the final lines of his poem read: *The yang spirit surges forth, returning alone.* He wrote these words and then passed away, with an extraordinary fragrance filling the room for several days. His *Collection of Water and Clouds* circulates in the world. Born on the first day of the third month, he ascended on the first day of the fourth month.

**Perfected Lord Changsheng**
Surnamed Liu, named Chuxuan, styled Tongmiao, with the sobriquet Master Changsheng. A native of Wuguan Village in Donglai.

Upon attaining the Dao, on the sixth day of the second month in the third year of the Song Ningzong’s Jiatai reign (the *guihai* year), he gathered his followers with the sound of a drum, rested his head upon his arm, and passed away. His six literary collections—*Immortal Music*, *Great Void*, *Pan Yang*, *With the Dust*, *Peace and Leisure*, and *Cultivating the True*—along with his *Commentary on the Dao and Its Virtue*, *Exposition of the Yin Talisman*, and *Explanation of the Yellow Court* remain in the world.

At the age of twenty, he became a disciple of Chongyang. At twenty-seven, he entered Panhan, where he dwelled in a cave to cultivate the Dao.

At thirty-three, he returned to dwell in Mount Longmen of Longzhou, enduring austerities as he had at Pan Brook. After attaining the Dao, at forty-two he answered the summons of Jin Shizong to reside at court. At sixty-two, when Qi and Lu fell to the Song, Emperor Ningzong summoned him, but he did not go. At sixty-five, he was received by Emperor Chengjis, as detailed in the *Record of Auspicious Assembly* and his memorial responses. For his deeds in averting disasters and relieving droughts, he became a meritorious minister of the Yuan dynasty. His *Pan Brook* and *Crying the Dao* collections, along with the *Record of the Western Journey*, remain in the world. In the dinghai year, on the ninth day of the seventh month, the Master ascended the hall to address the assembly, leaving behind a gatha on the matter of life and death before sitting in transformation.

**Perfected Lord Yuyang**
Surnamed Wang, named Chuyi, styled Yuyang, with the sobriquet Master Sanyang. A native of Dongmou in Ninghai. Born on the eighteenth day of the third month in the second year of the Jin Huangtong reign (renxu). He received the Dao from Chongyang and dwelled in Yun’guang Cave, where his resolve and conduct were firm and austere. After attaining the Dao, he displayed great numinous wonders: converting people, expelling demons, toppling bandits, shattering stones, projecting his spirit in dreams, summoning rain, shaking peaks, boiling chickens to summon cranes, reviving the dead, and restoring the withered. Jin Shizong, hearing his name, summoned him for an audience and was greatly pleased. Envious rivals poisoned him with aconite, but the Master entered water, which receded, and he did not die. His *Yunguang Collection* and *Record of Manifest Wonders* remain in the world. Born on the eighteenth day of the third month, he ascended on the twenty-second day of the fourth month.

**Perfected Lord Guangning**
Surnamed Hao, named Datong, styled Taigu, with the sobriquet Master Guangning. A native of Ninghai. Born on the third day of the first month in the third year of the Jin Xizong’s Tianchun reign (gengshen). A man of great wealth, he became a disciple of Chongyang.

Initially named Lin, with the sobriquet Master Tranquil. Though he entered the Dao, his resolve was not one of austere discipline, until Changzhen and Yuyang urged and inspired him. At Mount Qi, he encountered a divine person who [bestowed upon him] the oral instructions of the Golden Elixir and changed his name and sobriquet to those he bears now. He then wandered through Zhao and Wei, cultivating the Dao until his practice was perfected, whereupon he left behind his verses and departed. His *Collection of Taigu*, *Heart Sutra*, *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering*, *Diagrams of the Great Transformation of the Yi*, and *Direct Teachings in Plain Words* circulate in the world.

Her father, Sun Zhongxian, arranged her marriage to Ma Yifu of the prefecture, with whom she had three sons. Chongyang, through the division of ten pears, transformed the couple, whereupon the Immortal Maiden left her home to study the Dao. She dwelled in Phoenix Immortal Grotto in Luoyang to cultivate her practice. The couple often urged one another on, and both attained the Dao. Her poems and lyrics circulate in the world.

Born on the fifth day of the first month, he ascended on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month.

**Perfected Lord of the Yellow Chamber**
Surnamed Song, named Youdao, styled Defang, with the sobriquet Lord of the Yellow Chamber. A native of Mianyang Prefecture. Proficient in all ritual methods, he could summon clouds with talismans when none were present, or part the clouds to reveal the Dipper when they obscured the sky—hence his contemporary title, Perfected One Who Parts the Clouds. One day, he encountered [Wang] Danyang, who transmitted to him the secret formulas of the Golden Elixir’s fire phases. After two years of practice, he attained the ability to duplicate his body without dying. Later, he journeyed to the Eastern Sea, where, during the time when Chinggis Khan of the Great Yuan summoned Master Qiu of Changchun, he served as the foremost among the eighteen who assisted in the journey. Emperor Shizu bestowed upon him the title Perfected One Who Propagates the Dao and Parts the Clouds to Vastly Teach, and Emperor Wuzong further honored him as Perfected One of Mystic Penetration, Supreme Dao, Venerable Culture, and Illuminating Transformation. Later, he transmitted the Supreme Dao to Perfected Lord Li of Great Emptiness, and the Lord of the Yellow Chamber vanished without a trace. Some say he passed away in a seated posture at Changchun [Palace] in Yan.

**Perfected Lord of Great Emptiness**
Surnamed Li, named Jue, styled Shuangyu. A native of Chongqing Prefecture in Shu. Having received the Golden Elixir’s Dao from the Lord of the Yellow Chamber, he changed his name to Qizhen and adopted the sobriquet Great Emptiness. He then retreated to the Wuyi Mountains in Shaowu to cultivate the Golden Elixir in seclusion. After seven months, with his attainment nearly complete, he began his return journey, passing through Longhu. The previous evening, someone at the Yu Altar dreamed of a perfected one’s arrival, though the region had long suffered drought and prayers had gone unanswered. The next day, the Perfected Lord indeed arrived, but none recognized him—only the dreamer saw a poor Daoist and declared, “This is the one.” The crowd begged for rain, and a timely downpour followed. He then traveled to Yuzhen Hermitage in Zhenzhou, where he sat in a walled garden. Later, he emerged and transmitted the Dao to Zhang Ziqiong, charging him: “The Golden Elixir should be cultivated in seclusion; the Great Dao ought to be passed to others.” Thereafter, he entered Mount Qingcheng and vanished without a trace. Born on the tenth day of the first month, he attained the Dao on the fifteenth day of the eighth month.

**Perfected Lord Ziqiong**
Surnamed Zhang, named Mo, styled Junfan. A native of Dexing in Raozhou. Upon hearing the Dao, he changed his name to Daoxin. Initially, Perfected Lord of Great Emptiness happened to lodge at Xichun Palace in Anren, where Ziqiong sought the transmission of the Golden Elixir, but Great Emptiness refused. Later, while at the market, he saw Ziqiong give thirty coins to a beggar and declared, “Now it may be transmitted.” Thereupon, he imparted the Dao of the Golden Elixir to him. The following year, they met again in Zhenzhou, where the full fire phases were completed. After grasping the essentials, Ziqiong later transmitted the Supreme Dao to Master Yuan Du of Zhao and then withdrew into seclusion. Born on the second day of the tenth month, he attained the Dao on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month.

**Perfected Lord Yuan Du**
Surnamed Zhao, named Youqin, styled Yuan Du. A native of Rao Commandery. As a descendant of the Zhao clan, he lost his family in a fire in his youth and early developed a fondness for the mountains and forests. Exceptionally intelligent, he mastered astronomy, geography, and the arts of divination. Upon receiving the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir from Master Ziqiong, he combed through the classics and scriptures, composing the treatise *Three Teachings as One Family*, which he titled *Dao and Buddha Share a Common Source*. He also authored *Questions on the Golden Elixir* and other works that circulated in the world. In the autumn of the *jisi* year, while residing in Hengyang, he transmitted the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir in its entirety to Shangyangzi. Born on the eighteenth day of the sixth month.
