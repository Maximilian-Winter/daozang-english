**Memorial Presenting *Dongtian Haiyue Tu* (Charts of Cavern-Heavens, Seas, and Sacred Mountains)**
Your subject, Daoist Li Sicong of the Dazhong Xiangfu Abbey in Qianzhou, humbly submits:

I observe that the jade tablets and purple scriptures of the Dao, though bound in emerald cases and vermilion seals, have grown vast in their scrolls and boundless in their translations. Consider the profound and wondrous canons of the Three Clarities, or the radiant *Chart of the True Forms of the Five Peaks*—ancient texts once preserved in the gardens of the immortals, now matched by the *Records of the Ten Isles*. The true wind of the Dao stretches far and wide, yet historians have seldom discussed it, and scholars of past dynasties have rarely compiled its records.

In the intervals of court rituals and the remnants of incense offerings, I have secretly probed its mysteries and arranged its order. Though the cinnabar terraces lie distant and the Purple Courts remain secluded, all are depicted in these charts, as clear as pointing to the palm of one’s hand. May those who revere the highest realms join in praising the imperial virtue, and may those who savor the Dao offer blessings to the celestial designs.

By the grace of this era of grand tranquility, I have striven to propagate the pure wind of the Dao, gathering the charts of immortals to present to the sagely throne. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head again and again.

I reverently reflect upon Your Majesty, the Emperor who embodies Heaven, models the Dao, and reveres culture, wisdom, divinity, and filial virtue. Grasping the Auspicious Talisman, You govern the realm; wielding the Golden Mirror, You oversee the people. Your Dao surpasses that of a hundred kings, and Your virtue descends through a thousand ages. Like the clouds of Yao sheltering the fields, all things revive; like the sun of Shun illuminating the heavens, the eight directions bask in harmony. Thus, the customs of the eastern Yi and southern Yue bow in reverence, while the northern Hu and western Rong submit in sincerity. All who encounter this sagely reign are utterly devoted.

I have, since my youth, devoted myself to the foundational teachings, yet upon examining the works of former worthies, I found the accounts of Daoist marvels often scattered and their roots seldom explored. Day and night, I have concentrated my mind, searching through scriptures and records, gathering facts and shaping them into chapters. Over the years, these efforts have filled many scrolls. Now, I have compiled the *Chart of the Jade Clarity’s Ultimate Journey*, the *Chart of the Five Peaks of the Cavern-Heavens*, the *Chart of Penglai and the Celestial Gardens*, the *Chart of the Great Qi’s Numinous Tides*, the *Chart of Famous Mountains and Blessed Lands*, and the *Chart of Golden Liquor and the Returned Elixir*. Fortunate to live in this enlightened age, I dare not conceal these works in my humble abode but aspire to present them at the dragon court. Should they merit even a glance from Your Sagely Perusal, my lifelong toil would not have been in vain.

I now take the liberty of submitting them with this memorial, though I tremble at the presumption of approaching the imperial gaze. I am overwhelmed with fear and trembling, prostrate and anxious.

With utmost awe and reverence, I bow my head again and again.

Respectfully submitted.
First day of the twelfth month, first year of Huangyou, Song Dynasty

**Memorial Requesting the Presentation of *Dongtian Haiyue Mingshan Tu* (Charts of Cavern-Heavens, Seas, and Sacred Mountains)**
Li Sicong, Daoist of the Dazhong Xiangfu Abbey in Qianzhou.

Your subject, Li Sicong, a humble figure from the wilds, was born in an era of prosperity. I have long encountered the teachings of non-action and now serve in this court of the Dao. My nature is dull and unsuited to fathoming the scriptures of immortals; my wisdom is shallow and unequal to measuring the depths of the Qi and the seas.

Since the first year of Mingdao, I have delved into the secret canons of the Daoist gate and the true teachings of the sagely lineage, exploring their hidden traces and refining their wondrous essence. I have compiled the *Chart of the Jade Void’s Ultimate Journey*, depicting the divine transformations of the formless and revolving images; the *Chart of the Five Peaks of the Cavern-Heavens*, extolling the numinous realms of the sacred mountains; the *Chart of Penglai and the Celestial Gardens*, celebrating the splendor of the Peng Island and Ten Isles; the *Chart of the Great Qi’s Numinous Tides*, expounding the mysteries of the dragon palaces and sea scriptures; the *Chart of Famous Mountains and Blessed Lands*, chanting the secret scenes of the Purple Courts and cinnabar terraces; and the *Chart of Golden Liquor and the Returned Elixir*, assembling the fire phases of the immortals. Fearing the vastness of these charts might burden the reader, I have also separately compiled the *Scrolls for Casual Perusal*, totaling ten scrolls, all now complete.

I have gathered these facts through years of arduous effort, my sole wish being to praise the imperial way. I dare not seek undue imperial favor. Now, as the Qian Yuan Festival approaches, I humbly request permission to submit these charts in six copies, along with the ten scrolls of the *Scrolls for Casual Perusal*, for presentation to the throne.

As stated above.

Regarding the memorial of Daoist Li Sicong, beyond the aforementioned matters, I, Liang Gong, along with the officials of this prefecture, have investigated and confirmed that Daoist Li Sicong has long cultivated his Daoist practice and immersed himself in the scriptures of immortals. Over the years, his diligence and contributions have become increasingly evident. His verses on the grotto-heavens of Peng Mountain and the journeys of the Jade Clarity, compiled into charts and accompanied by poems and prefaces, shine with brilliant diction and a refined, fresh style. They are worthy of imperial perusal to invigorate the true teachings. Moreover, as the Qian Yuan Festival nears and tribute fills the court, we wish to present these wondrous works of the lofty immortals, hoping they may align with the sagely designs. Should they be included among the offerings and grace the imperial gaze, our earnest hopes would be fulfilled.

The *Charts of the Jade Clarity’s Ultimate Journey* and others each include poems and prefaces, their words and intentions truly admirable. These charts are currently in the custody of this prefecture, awaiting imperial decree before daring to present them.

Awaiting Your Majesty’s command.

From the Secretariat, Liu Zifu transmits to the昭信军: A memorial from Vanzhou Prefecture reports on Daoist Li Sicong of the Dazhong Xiangfu Abbey. Since the first year of the Mingdao era, he has successively delved into the esoteric canons of the Daoist gate and the true transmissions of successive sages, tracing subtle traces and exhaustively exploring their wondrous origins. He has compiled:

*The Charts of the Jade Clarity’s Ultimate Journey*, expounding the divine transformations of wandering in emptiness;
*The Charts of the Five Marchmounts and Grotto-Heavens*, extolling the numinous realms of the Five Marchmounts and immortal mountains;
*The Charts of Penglai and the Yuanyuan Gardens*, praising the sublime vistas of the Penglai Isles and the Ten Continent-Isles;
*The Charts of the Great Darkness and the Numinous Scriptures*, revealing the profound mysteries of the Dragon Palace and the oceanic depths;
*The Charts of Famous Mountains and Blessed Lands*, chanting the esoteric canons of the Purple Palace and the Cinnabar Terraces;
*The Charts of the Golden Liquor and the Returned Elixir*, assembling the alchemical *huohou* of the divine immortals.

Six sets of charts, along with ten scrolls of *The Reclining Figure*, are hereby requested for presentation. The officials of this prefecture have examined them and find them truly worthy of selection. The charts are currently in the custody of this prefecture, awaiting imperial decree before daring to present them. We humbly await your command.

By imperial edict: Vanzhou Prefecture is ordered to transmit and present them. Transmitted to Vanzhou. As directed.

Twenty-seventh day of the third month, second year of the Huangyou era.

*Anthology of the Abyssal Depths*, Scroll One
*Collected Works of Master Chongmiao Li Sicong*

**Preface to the *Odes of the Three Realms***
The *Odes of the Three Realms* correspond to the Three Powers. Their eighty-one chapters correspond to the number nine squared. The *Odes of the Jade Clarity* praise the divine transformations of the Three Clarities’ revolving images; the *Odes of the Grotto-Heavens* depict the sublime vistas of the Five Marchmounts and grotto-heavens; the *Odes of the Sea and Mountains* describe the immortal landscapes of Penglai and the Yuanyuan Gardens. Thus the Three Powers are complete, and the ninefold numbers arise.

Formerly, Master Xiyi composed the *Pointers to the Mysterious*, expounding the wondrous principles of cultivating the body and nurturing the *qi*. Now, in my *Odes of the Three Realms*, I chant the profound regions of emptiness, grotto-heavens, and island-paradises. Though ancient and modern differ, each speaks its intent. All are based on the immortal scriptures, treasure records, and phoenix-enfolded celestial texts, thoroughly investigating their root sources. I dare not indulge in idle speculation, lest I rashly and superficially probe the abyssal depths. My sole hope is to transmit these to those who cultivate the true and don the feathered robes of immortality. How could I presume to display them to scholars of refined diction or gentlemen who savor the Dao? May they together invigorate the true wind.

Written on the Shangyuan Festival, second year of the Huangyou era of the Song.

**Preface to the *Odes of the Three Clarities***
The *Odes of the Three Clarities* narrate the transmission and descent of the scriptures and precepts of the Three Clarities.

The Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning is the essence of Heaven and Earth, the primal ancestor of the ultimate Dao. Born of spontaneity, when it disperses, it becomes *qi*; when it rests, it becomes spirit. Without beginning or end, it eternally abides. Dwelling in the Upper Realm, it is the origin of the myriad heavens; in the Middle Realm, the root of the myriad transformations; in the Lower Realm, the sovereign of the myriad emperors. Without a name to revere, it is called the Celestial Venerable, initiating the worlds of humans and gods. It cannot be fathomed by reason or grasped by words. It engenders the myriad things yet does not govern them; it transforms the myriad kinds yet does not speak. Utmost in honor and supremacy, it is called the Celestial Venerable. It resides in the Jade Clarity’s sacred realm, the Celestial Palace of Subtle Radiance.

The Jade Morning Dao Lord is the incarnate transformation of the great Dao. To speak of its presence is impossible to pursue; to speak of its absence is to still acknowledge its evanescence. Thus, it is neither existent nor non-existent, neither present nor absent. Gazing upon it, no form is seen; listening to it, no sound is heard. Within the interplay of wondrous being and wondrous non-being, the great Dao abides. The Dao Lord is the root of discerning the Dao, the origin of penetrating the Dao, the *qi* of the Dao. As a disciple receiving the Dao, he serves the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning, just as the Old Lord received and served him. He dwells in the Upper Clarity’s true realm, the Heaven of Yu Remnant, where he descended with the golden regulations, treasure records, and Three Grotto scriptures, entrusting them to the scripture master, the Perfected Yu Luoqiao, to transmit the teachings to the myriad lands.

The Venerable Lord of Primordial Simplicity is the ancestral founder of primordial *qi*, the root of Heaven and Earth. Across kalpas, he has acted as teacher, transforming through successive eras. At times in the Nine Heavens, at times wandering the Four Seas, there is no teaching without a master, no realm without a sovereign. He serves the Jade Morning Dao Lord as a disciple receiving the Dao. At times, descending among the Six Stars of the Celestial Hook and Celestial Enclosure in the Grand Tenuity, he is called the Celestial August Emperor, the Radiant Soul Treasure. In the Zhou dynasty, he was born, and Confucius once said: "The Old Master is my teacher," and inquired of him about ritual, gazing up to him as to a soaring dragon. Since the beginning of creation, he has descended over fifty times, crossing the Western Flowing Sands to transform China, serving as the patriarch of the Three Teachings and the model for a hundred kings. Through millennia, he has practiced the Dao, his divine transformations boundless. He resides in the Grand Clarity’s immortal realm, the Heaven of Great Vermilion.

The Five Numinous Lords of the Purple Tenuity’s Northern Culmen hold the central position in the Purple Tenuity Enclosure of the Middle Heaven, serving as the ancestral masters of the myriad images, around whom the host of stars revolves. In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, at the Northern Darkness’s Dengdu Luoshan, the demonic spirits of the six grotto-heavens emerged among humanity, slaughtering and harming people beyond measure, with none able to restrain them. The Celestial Emperor summoned the Northern Emperor, who led divine generals and heavenly troops to expel the baleful influences and rescue the multitudes. Upon completing his task, he ascended as emperor to the Middle Heaven, naturally assuming the supreme position of the Purple Tenuity.

The Seven Perfected Ones said: "Our ancestral master, the Northern Culmen, has across kalpas diligently offered incense and lamps, making offerings to the Three Clarities. With merit complete and virtue perfected, he ascended to the imperial position of the Purple Tenuity. His comings and goings are ever accompanied by a flowery canopy, resplendent with the seven treasures’ starlight. Above, it reaches the myriad heavens; below, it illuminates the myriad lands. On the twenty-seventh day of each month, he descends to examine the sins and blessings of the world."

*The Scripture of Salvation* was expounded by the Celestial Venerable of Original Beginning in the Primordial Azure Heaven, proclaiming the true texts of the Four Directions’ Original Beginning, the secret names of the Five Thearchs and Demon Kings, and the inner sounds of the myriad heavens—words of profound mystery, not of the mundane world, concealed by the myriad heavens’ great sages in the Purple Tenuity’s palace. The Celestial Emperor, pitying that Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang have a destined number of kalpic destructions, and that the hells contain souls suffering the Five Torments and Eight Difficulties, entreated the celestial deities and immortals to expound the numinous sounds to save the multitudes. Above, it dispels celestial disasters; below, it wards off poisonous harms, pacifying and securing the dynastic fortune to preserve Heaven’s eternal endurance. This scripture is revered and wondrous, the ancestral founder of the myriad Daoist teachings.

The *Huangting Jing* was composed by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord within the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Jeweled Tower of the Upper Clarity’s true realm. This scripture arrays the chambers of the gods, revealing the dwelling of the womb spirits—it is the Way of the Perfected’s immortality. It is also called the *Supreme Zither-Heart Text*, the *Golden Writ of the Great Thearch*, and the *Jade Chapters of the Eastern Flower*. The Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea, along with the host of immortals, inscribed it upon white jade tablets in golden characters. Morning and evening, they paid homage to Heaven and Earth before the Divine King of Yang Valley transmitted it to the Purple Void Primordial Lady, Lady Wei, who then passed it into the world.

The *Daode Jing* was written by the Primal Venerable Lord in the Great Clarity Heaven. Long ago, when Emperor Shun governed with filial piety and fraternal duty, the Venerable Lord descended, styling himself Master Yin Shou, and bestowed upon Shun the Five Thousand Characters. Shun awakened to the subtleties of the formless and soundless, abdicated his throne, and withdrew into the wilderness of Cangwu. This text was kept secret and not transmitted until the reign of King Zhao of Zhou, when the Venerable Lord crossed the Flowing Sands to the west. Yin Xi, then magistrate of the pass, observed purple and black vapors coiling in the sky like dragons and serpents. Knowing a sage would cross the pass, he swept the streets and purified himself in anticipation. When he encountered the Venerable Lord, he prostrated himself in earnest supplication, begging to rescue his rotting corpse and withered bones and entreating the gift of secret teachings. Moved by his anguish, the Venerable Lord halted his chariot and expounded the Five Thousand Characters anew, personally annotating it as *Sectional Exegesis*. Later, the River Earl presented it to Emperor Wen of Han, dividing it into the two scriptures of *Dao* and *Virtue*, arranged into eighty-one chapters, to be preserved in the world.

The *Qingjing Jing* is the Venerable Lord’s secret discourse. The Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate, Ge Xuan, said: "This scripture is treasured in the heavens and not transmitted to lesser scholars. I once received it from the Eastern Flower Thearch. The Eastern Flower Thearch transmitted it to the Golden Portal Thearch, who passed it to the Queen Mother of the West. All conveyed it as a secret text of immortality. Superior scholars who awaken to it ascend as celestial officials; middling scholars attain it as immortals of the Southern Palace; and lesser scholars who receive it enjoy long life in the world. Roaming the Three Realms, they ascend into the Golden Gate."

The *Yinfu Jing* consists of three hundred words bestowed by the Dark Lady upon the Yellow Thearch. The first hundred contain the Way of embracing the One for immortality; the middle hundred hold the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; and the last hundred encompass the arts of strengthening the army and securing victory. The Yellow Thearch obtained it and ascended into the Cloud Han. *Yin* means "hidden," and *fu* means "accord." The celestial mechanism accords with the workings of affairs—hence it is called the *Yinfu Jing*.

The *Upper Clarity’s Precious Record* is the wondrous Way of the Three Luminaries’ Nine Heavens’ precious writ. Its ultimate truth emerges from the Great Veil. The Jade Capital’s Upper Palace, where the Jade Thearch conceals it, is revered by all sages. Sealed within the Jasper Terrace, those who ascend as lofty immortals and bear names inscribed in the Golden Portal may all wear and bear it, paying homage to the Upper Clarity. This text arose before the Primordial Beginning, weaving the darkness of soaring mystery, its jade characters illuminating the vast firmament, venerated by the myriad spirits. The Supreme Jade Thearch transmitted it to the Grand Tenuity; the Heavenly Thearch transmitted it to the Upper Clarity. The perfected saints who attained the Way received it from the King of Lesser Existence Heaven, who passed it to the Perfected Lord Wang of the Purple Void, Lady Wei. Lady Wei transmitted it to Yang Siming and the Archivist Xu of Mount Mao, who later brought it into the world.

The *Lingbao Immortal Ledger Scripture* is the text formed from the essence of the Nine Darknesses. Its radiance blazes brilliantly, ascending to the might of the Nine Heavens above and extinguishing the malevolence of the Six Heavens below. This most secret treasure of the Thearch is not casually glimpsed by those whose names are not inscribed on golden tablets or jade writs. The Dao Lord transmitted it to the Heavenly Thearch of the Grand Tenuity; the Heavenly Thearch transmitted it to the Posterior Sage Thearch of the Golden Portal; the Posterior Sage Thearch transmitted it to the Azure Lad, who passed it to the perfected saints who attained the Way. Xu Laile transmitted it to Immortal Duke Ge, and it was later preserved in the world.

The *Zhengyi Mengwei Record* originated when, during the Later Han, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord descended in a five-colored cloud chariot, his retinue impeccably arrayed. Alighting upon Mount Crane’s Cry, he addressed Celestial Master Zhang Daoling: "I see the lower realm overrun with demons and ghosts, human affairs in disarray, and the people suffering premature death. I bestow upon you the *Orthodox Unity Register*—one scroll—and two divine swords. You shall eradicate malevolent spirits, return the perverse to rectitude, harmonize Heaven and invert Earth, and safeguard the state and secure the household. Upon accomplishing this, you shall ascend to the Land of No-Where." The Celestial Master received his mandate and entered the Western Marchmounts to enact his transformation. He subdued the two demon masters, Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, as his disciples, converting the Twenty-Four Demon Prisons into Twenty-Four Blessed Courts. Distinguishing day from night, he bound the spirits by oath, ensuring the cosmos’ purity and tranquility and the people’s long life. Thereafter, during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, he ascended in broad daylight, his rank established as Perfected of Orthodox Unity. The transmission of the register began from this point.

The *Daoist Golden Regulations and Jade Precepts* recount that in the second year of Han’an, on the fifteenth night of the first month at midnight, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord descended in a nine-dragon jade chariot, his majesty resplendent, filling the firmament. Celestial hymns resounded as he hovered ten thousand *ren* above the earth, circling without descending. The Celestial Master rent his heart in reverent gaze and beheld the Dao Lord admonishing the Perfected: "Formerly, I dispatched you to the Western Marchmounts to subdue demons, but you did not await the celestial tally, arbitrarily summoning thunder and rain. You overtaxed your officers and soldiers, exceeding proper bounds. You drove the stars and constellations, throwing the sun and moon into chaos."

The transgression shook the Celestial Courts above and terrified the Nether Bureaus below. Blackness filled the sky, and baleful radiance suffused his form. Now the Supreme Emperor holds you accountable for your faults, records your offenses, and I can no longer draw near to you.

The Celestial Master, grief-stricken, prostrated himself and begged for death before the Dao Lord’s chariot, pleading for deliverance. Moved by his contrition, the Dao Lord dispatched a Merit Clerk Messenger to open the Purple Yang Jade Summit, from which three scrolls of plain script emerged, inscribed: *Jade Regulations and Golden Precepts: Rites for Atonement, Erasure of Black Registers, and Salvation of the Nine Ancestors*. The Celestial Master received the mandate and withdrew to Mount Crane’s Call, where he purified himself and performed the prescribed jiao rites to petition the myriad spirits. His merit ascended through the heavens, and in broad daylight, he rose to the Celestial Dawn, attaining the rank of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Master and Upholder of the Teachings. The transmission of the *Jade Regulations and Golden Precepts for Fasting and Jiao Rites* began from this point.

The Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Metropolis spans ninety thousand *li* in circumference. It coalesced from the congealed essence of Yang radiance, standing rootless and suspended in the Infinite Great Luo Heaven. The mountain’s seven-jeweled palaces and towers gleam across the heavens, its form broad above and narrow below, resembling Kunlun. Along its flanks, twelve celestial realms arise naturally from Yang essence, their expanse boundless. Below, seven-jeweled forests spread in luxuriant cover, encircled by the Eight Heavens. The Eight Paths serve as the avenues where immortals of the eight directions receive their duties. Upon the petals and leaves, all things are born of Mysterious Essence, inscribed with phoenix scripts and dragon sigils—the sacred texts of the inner heavens, the verses of the Dao and the Inaudible. The hymns of the host of sages defy full comprehension, while divine winds stir the celestial music of the Grand Void, the abode of the August Emperor of the Primordial Void. Myriad sages attend his court, for this is the City of the Ultimate Dao, the Mysterious Metropolis of the Loftiest Immortals.

The Fengdu Luoshan lies in the north, in the *gui* region, the gateway of ghosts and the root of deathly essence. The mountain rises two thousand six hundred *li* high, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*. Within it lies a cavern palace, the capital of ghosts and spirits. The mountain’s interior and exterior each contain twelve palaces, together forming the Twenty-Four Yin Palaces, where the judgment and punishment of sinful souls take place. The Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, and Twenty-Four Prisons—along with the nether officials and ghostly administrators who oversee the Black Registers—are all formed from turbid, congealed essence, the foundation of the earth and the sovereign of Yin. They constitute the pivot of the Nine Earths. The forests and grasses here are imbued with venomous, malevolent essence. What grows here are blades that flash like lightning, while black smoke billows ceaselessly day and night. Within, punitive divine soldiers constantly interrogate and discipline sinful souls.

On the days of the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, the Northern Emperor and the nether officials summon forth souls exhausted by kalpas of suffering, demanding an account of their transgressions, the origins of their offenses, their native prefectures, counties, and villages, the locations of their graves, and the eras and places of their lives. If their sins are grave and Heaven has not yet pardoned them, their misfortunes will flow to their descendants in the world, giving rise to calamities. The Northern Emperor governs the ghostly officials who guard this mountain, where all palaces and towers are formed from the congealed essence of yellow essence. The officials here are ancient emperors and kings, loyal ministers, and filial children who performed meritorious deeds, now serving as nether officials clad in yellow robes and plain cinnabar-embroidered garments.

Every seventh day of the seventh month, they review the good and evil deeds of the living, reporting the offenses recorded in the Black Registers to the Celestial Courts. Those whose hearts remain clouded by dust cannot awaken or guide their ancestors. The ranks of the Earth Offices are graded according to hierarchy.

The thirty-two heavens are now complete.
All offices govern the affairs of the Three Realms.

The Three Realms are known as the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm—collectively called the Three Realms. The lowest six heavens constitute the Realm of Desire. The middle nineteen heavens form the Realm of Form; these two realms are shaped by kalpas and molded by yin and yang, their *qi* subject to exhaustion. Above them lie three heavens comprising the Formless Realm. Mortals are bound by years, while beyond them exist four heavens of Seed People, extending upward to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven. All are woven from the *qi* of emptiness and purity, transformed and illuminated by the yang radiance, untouched by the transgressions of sun and moon. Beneath this heaven, darkness and light arise—all realms of the Three Purities and Great Luo, neither born nor destroyed, beyond the reckoning of kalpas and the reach of the ninety-six disasters of yang. This is the ultimate domain of the Dao, the realm where all sages gather in homage, the very root from which the Primordial True *Qi* gives rise to the ten thousand things.
