### **The Orthodox Essentials of the Golden Elixir**
Compiled by Hu Hùnchéng, a *Five Peaks* (Wǔlíng) scholar of *Daoist* mysticism.

Before heaven and earth were distinguished, all was but a single **Chaos** (Hùndùn). Once chaos was pierced, **Yin** and **Yang** emerged!

What obtained **Yang qi**, light and pure, ascending—became **Heaven** (Tiān).
What obtained **Yin qi**, heavy and turbid, descending—became **Earth** (Dì).
What obtained the fullness of both **Yin** and **Yang qi**, residing in the center—became **Humanity** (Rén).

With the positions of the **Three Powers** (Sān Cái) thus established, the **Primordial** (Xiāntiān) and **Derivative** (Hòutiān) were divided!

All say that the **Primordial** is **Pure Yang** (Chúnyáng), the **One Origin** (Yīběn);
The **Derivative** is **Pure Yin** (Chúnyīn), the **Ten Thousand Diversities** (Wànshū).

The **Supreme Sovereign** (Shàngdì) descended and formed humanity,
Bestowing nature and command—all receive the **True One of the Great Unity** (Tàiyǐ hántián).
The **Primordial ancestral qi** (Xiāntiān zǔqì), most subtle and most refined,
Is **only essence, only unity** (Wéi jīng wéi yī),
Pure and true, central and rectified—
All may become **immortals** (Shénxiān), all may become **sages** (Shèngxiān).
Without wisdom or folly, all are equal in their initial reception.

Yet few know that what humanity obtains from heaven
Is but a single point of **Pure Yang Primordial ancestral qi** (Xiāntiān zǔqì) aside—
So-called **spirit** (Jīng), **mind** (Shén), **soul** (Hún), **ethereal soul** (Pò), **intellect** (Yì),
**heart** (Xīn), **liver** (Gān), **spleen** (Pí), **lungs** (Fèi), **kidneys** (Shèn),
**essence** (Jīng), **semen** (Zhēn), **saliva** (Tì), **tears** (Yì), **nasal mucus** (Jìng), **bodily fluids** (Yè),
**ears** (Ēr), **mouth** (Kǒu), **nose** (Bí), **tongue** (Shé), **sounds** (Shēng),
Even to the **hundred bones** (Bǎi huái) and **nine orifices** (Jiǔ qiào),
**Fingernails** (Zhuǎ), **hair** (Fà), **skin** (Pífū), **flesh** (Gòu),
The **four limbs** (Sì tǐ) of the body—
From crown to sole—
All are shaped by the **Derivative Pure Yin** (Hòutiān chúnyīn), formed by the **Four Great Elements** (Sìdà) in false combination.

The **Primordial ancestral qi** (Zǔqì) is **faint and indistinct** (Huǎnghuǎng hūhū),
**Distant and obscure** (Yǎoyǎo míngmíng).
Within it, there is **something** (Wù),
Yet **something** that is not **thing** (Wù ér fēiwù);
Within it, there is **essence** (Jīng),
Yet **essence** that is not **essence** (Jīng ér fēijīng).
Seemingly present, seemingly absent;
As if lost, as if retained.

Approach it, yet it cannot be seen;
Seek it, yet it cannot be obtained.
Its vastness knows no boundary—
It contains all phenomena;
Its subtlety knows no interior—
Not even a single thread can escape it.

This **qi** must be known:
Within the human body, there is a **single orifice** (Yī qiào),
A **most subtle realm** (Zì xū zhì dì) where it is stored—
The **Mysterious Pass** (Xuānguān) is that aperture.

Who obtains it becomes an **immortal** (Shénxiān);
Who loses it becomes a **lower ghost** (Xiàguǐ).
For those who obtain it, even a single point is preserved;
For those who lose it, **ten thousand, myriad** points are squandered.

Alas! How humanity fails to safeguard that single point of **Primordial ancestral qi** (Xiāntiān zǔqì),
Often drifting into loss!

They do not know that the **Derivative transformations** (Hòutiān zàohuà)
Are all but **emptiness and illusion** (Xūwàng).

Thus, the **Original Essence** (Yuánjīng), **Original Qi** (Yuánqì), and **Original Spirit** (Yuánshén)
Also forget their **Primordial** source,
And instead are **attached to the Derivative** (Zhuó yú hòutiān).

Some are plagued by the **Three Corpses** (Sānshī) within,
**Nine Vermin** (Jiǔchóng) consuming their essence,
**Six Bandits** (Liù zéi) stealing their form,
**Seven Emotions** (Qīqíng) draining their spirit,
**Five Desires** (Wǔyù) disturbing their mind—
All things, myriad and confused,
**Ten thousand affairs** (Wànjī) dazzling and bewildering.

The eyes gaze upon **colors** (Cǎisè),
The ears listen to **sounds** (Shēngyīn),
The mouth craves **flavors** (Zīwèi)—
Following what they encounter,
They are **ensnared by their thoughts** (Zhuó qí xiǎng).
If they take delight in **external stimuli** (Wàijī),
It enters through the eyes;
Once it enters within,
It moves the mind—
When the mind is stirred,
It **shakes the spirit** (Yáo shén);
Once the spirit is shaken,
It **spills the essence** (Xiè jīng);
Once the essence is spilled,
It **consumes the qi** (Hào qì);
Once the qi is consumed,
The **form** (Xíng) and **spirit** (Shén) begin to depart.

**Faint and indistinct**, illusory and false,
**Worries and anxieties** (Yōusī gǎnqíng) stir the emotions,
**Labors and affairs** (Shìwù láo xíng) weary the form—
When **essence is disordered** (Jīng luàn) and **spirit is scattered** (Shén sàn),
The **True One** (Zhēnyī) leaves the body,
And the **Primordial ancestral qi** (Xiāntiān zǔqì) is daily lost—
Thus, it wanders endlessly
In the **realm of Derivative life and death** (Hòutiān shēngsǐ zhì yù).

The **Daoist Ancestor**, the **Most High Laozi** (Dàoshàng Lǎojūn), pitied this,
And thus the **Great Dao of the Golden Elixir** (Jīndān Dàodào) arose,
Teaching humanity the **saying of return** (Fǎn huán zhī shuō).
**Return** (Fǎn) is to **return to the origin** (Fǎn běn),
**Restore** (Huán) is to **return to the source** (Huán yuán)—
To **return the Derivative** (Fǎn hòutiān)
And **restore the Primordial** (Fù huán xiāntiān) is all!

Since the name **Golden Elixir** (Jīndān) was established,
The **Way of the Golden Elixir** (Jīndān zhī dào) took form,
And thus the **books of the Golden Elixir** (Jīndān zhī shū) emerged.

I say that the **Golden Elixir’s True Unity** (Jīndān xūyuán)
Is the **Great Dao**, neither **non-being** (Wú) nor **being** (Yǒu),
But rather **the emergence of non-being within being** (Yǒuzhōng shēng yuán),
And **the emergence of being within non-being** (Yuánzhōng shēng yǒu).

The **Great Dao of the Golden Elixir** (Jīndān Dàodào),
Nor is it **non-being** (Fēi yuán),
Nor is it **being** (Fēi yǒu)—
Then what of the **cauldron and implements** (Dǐngqì) and **fire stages** (Huǒhòu)?
Are they truly **real** (Yǒu)?
Are they truly **non-real** (Wú)?
Or are they but **symbolic methods** (Jiǎ fǎxiàng) to illustrate the **Great Dao**?

Because the **Golden Elixir** (Jīndān) has **symbolic names** (Yǒu xiàng zhī gu),
It implies that **casting gold requires a furnace and cauldron** (Zhuó jīn bì yǒu lú dǐng),
**Refining the elixir requires sacred herbs** (Xiū dān bì yǒu língyào),
**Alchemizing the herbs requires fire stages** (Liàn yào bì yǒu huǒhòu)—
And thus the name was established!

Now, those who practice the **external Golden Elixir** (Wàidān),
Must first **gather the five metals and eight stones** (Jù wǔjīn bāshí) as medicinal substances,
Then **set up earthenware cauldrons** (Lì tǎoyě tǔfǔ zhī dǐngqì),
Next **use the true fire of Fúrén’s drilling** (Shì yú Xuànrén zuànmù zhī zhēnhuǒ),
Following the method to **refine and transmute** (Yī fǎ duǎn liàn).
When successful,
They can **revive the dead** (Huíshēng qǐsǐ),
**Reverse aging and restore youth** (Fǎnlǎo huán yīng),
**Transform putridity into divine beings** (Huà chòufǔ wéi shénqí),
And **turn worthless fragments into gold treasures** (Diǎn wǎlì wéi jīnbǎo).

Only then do they realize:
The **Way of refining the internal Golden Elixir** (Nèidān zhī dào)
Is **not a hair’s breadth off** (Háomǐ bù chà),
**As if perfectly aligned** (Ruò hé fújié).
**Gather the Primordial ancestral qi** (Jù xiāntiān zǔqì) as medicinal substances,
**Guard the Mysterious Pass orifice** (Shǒu xuānguān yī qiào) as the cauldron,
**Employ the wondrous function of the Original Spirit** (Yǐ yuánshén miàoyòng) as the fire stages—
**Daily refining, monthly alchemizing** (Rì duǎn yuè liàn),
**Timely cooking and scorching** (Shí pēng kè jìng).
When success is achieved,
They can **shed the mortal shell and exchange bones** (Tuō tǎi huàn gǔ),
**Transcend the ordinary and enter sainthood** (Chāofán rù shèng),
**Ride the cranes and soar to the Ninth Heaven** (Kuà luán hè ér chōng jiǔ xiāo),
**Ascend Kunlun and wander the Eight Extremes** (Dēng Kūnlún ér yóu bājí).

The **essence of the Great Dao** (Dàodào zhī yào)
Is no more than this.

Later generations’ **Golden Elixir scriptures** (Dānshū),
In **ten thousand volumes** (Qiān piān wàn juàn),
**Long odes and short verses** (Chánggē duǎnjù),
Often do not **directly point to the True Unity’s origin** (Zhí zhǐ zhēnyī zàohuà zhī běngēn),
Or **the sequential steps of inner cultivation** (Xiàshǒu gōngfū zhī cìxù).
They are but **empty forms and false analogies** (Wú xiàng shě xíng),
**Borrowing those to speak of this** (Jiè bǐ yù cǐ)—
How different is this from **empty talk of emptiness** (Kōngdǐ tán kōng),
**Dream-speech within dreams** (Mèngzhōng zhī mèng)?
Seeking their effects,
It is **like trying to catch the wind** (Máng rú zhuō fēng).

Their teachings either **lose themselves in Buddhist doctrines of emptiness and tranquility** (Bùshī kōngjì zhī lùn),
Or **drift into eccentric sectarian paths** (Liú yú bàngmén qūjìng zhī pì),
**Perverted and disordered** (Diāndào cuòluàn),
**Branching and convoluted** (Zhīmàn tiáozhé).
They wish scholars to **follow their currents yet never reach the source** (Yù xuézhě xún qí liú ér mò jiū qí yuán),
To **enter their gates yet never know the path** (Yù rù qí mén ér mò zhī qí jìng).
They **mislead posterity**, and the **confusion is profound** (Wánguǒ hòurén, huò yě zīshèn).

Thus, the **Way of the Golden Elixir** (Jīndān zhī dào) was abandoned!

Even in the matter of **medicinal substances** (Yàowù),
They speak of **Kàn-Lì** (Kàn-Lì),
**Yīn-Yáng** (Yīn-Yáng), **Water-Fire** (Shuǐ-Huǒ),
**Sand and Mercury, Lead and Silver** (Shā yǒng yín yán),
**Father’s Essence and Mother’s Blood** (Fù jīng mǔ xuè),
**Wood’s Fluid and Metal’s Essence** (Mù yè jīn jīng),
**Cinnabar and Liquid Mercury** (Dānshā shuǐyín),
**Crow’s Essence and Rabbit’s Marrow** (Wū jīng tù suǐ),
**Sun’s Soul and Moon’s Spirit** (Rì hún yuè pò),
**Green Dragon and White Tiger** (Qīnglóng Báihǔ),
**Black Tortoise and Red Serpent** (Xuántuì chìshé),
**Pear and Date** (Jiāo lí huǒ zǎo),
**Male and Female Qi** (Zhīhóng qì bái),
**Infant and Maiden** (Yīng’ér chīnǚ)—
All such **diverse names** (Ruòshì zhī bù yī)
Are but **various designations for the same medicinal substances** (Jiē yàowù zhī yì míng).

Is there truly a so-called *medicinal substance* beyond the **Primordial Qi of the Ancestors** (Xiāntiān zǔqì)?

Speaking of the **cauldron and furnace** (Dǐnglú), they say **Divine Furnace and Cinnabar Cavity** (Shénlú dānxué), **Pine Cauldron and Divine Chamber** (Pénghú shénshì), **Jade Furnace and Golden Cauldron** (Yùlú jīndǐng), **Yellow Chamber and Central Palace** (Huángfáng zhōnggōng), **Yellow Aunt and Wu-Ji**, **Bright Hall and Empty Valley** (Míngtáng xūgǔ), **Knife and Pill, Mysterious Female** (Dāogūi xuānpìn), **Yīn and È**—all such varied names are but **different designations for the cauldron and furnace**.

Is there truly a so-called **cauldron and furnace** beyond the **Mysterious Pass** (Xuānguān)?

Speaking of **fire and timing** (Huǒhòu), they say **Pushing the Circulation of the Heavenly Cycle** (Tuī zhōutiān), **Measuring the Tides of Qi** (Cè cháo hòu), **Examining the Trigrams and Lines** (Àn guà yáo), **Applying the Gentle and Forceful** (Yòng wén wǔ), **Aligning with Eclipse and New Moon** (Zhǔn huì shuò), **Fixing the Crescent and Fullness** (Dìng xián wàng), **Clarifying Withdrawal and Addition** (Míng chōu tiān), **Alternating Advance and Retreat** (Hù jìn tuì), **Striking the Anvil and Key** (Gǔ qì yuè), **Weighing the Scales of Yin and Yang** (Chèng jīn liǎng), **Embodying Penalty and Virtue** (Tǐ xíng dé), **Observing Bathing and Purification** (Shì mù yù), **Dividing the Three and Five** (Fēn sān wǔ), **Practicing Pregnancy and Return** (Xíng rèn fù)—all such varied names are but **different designations for fire and timing**.

Is there truly a so-called **fire and timing** beyond the **Mysterious Function of the Primordial Spirit** (Yuánshén miàoyòng)?

Now, I do not follow the deceit of former masters to mislead later generations. Instead, I directly point to the **fundamental source of the Great Dao of Golden Elixir** (Jīndān dàdào) and speak of it in proper sequence:

1. **Establishing the Cauldron and Furnace** (Lì dǐnglú),
2. **Gathering the Medicinal Substances** (Jù yàowù),
3. **Conducting Fire and Timing** (Xíng huǒhòu).

Beyond these three, I dare not add or subtract.

What is **Establishing the Cauldron and Furnace**? It is **guarding the Mysterious Pass** (Shǒu xuānguān).

This Pass is hidden within the **Primordial Chaos** (Xiāntiān hùndùn), listening to the **void of having and non-having** (Tīng wú yǒu wú). Before parents gave birth to this body, this Pass already existed. Once it existed, the body came into being—this is what is called **existing with birth itself**.

It is neither above in Heaven nor below in Earth, nor within man. It is the **location of the Primordial Beginning’s suspended gem** (Yuánshǐ kōng xuán bǎozhū), five *zhang* above the earth, neither left nor right, neither up nor down, neither forward nor backward. It is neither existence nor non-existence, neither inside nor outside. Above, it connects to the **Vermilion Palace** (Jiàngōng) and pierces the **Muddy Pillow** (Níwán); below, it links to the **Cinnabar Field** (Dāntián) and reaches the **Yellow Spring** (Huángquán). Above it ascends, below it descends, and through the **Yellow Path** (Huángdào), it flows uninterrupted!

This is the **sacred site for gathering medicinal substances**.

What is **Gathering the Medicinal Substances**? It is **preserving a single point of Primordial Pure Yang Ancestral Qi** (Cún yīdiǎn xiāntiān chún yáng zǔqì).

This Qi arises before form and image, gathering within the **Boundless Supreme Ultimate** (Wújí tàijí). Before parents gave birth, the **Five Agents’ essences** (Èrwǔ zhī jīng) subtly merged and congealed. Before this body existed, this Qi already existed. Once it existed, the body came into being.

This Qi circulates, flowing through the **Six Voids** (Liùxū), forming the body, animating the mind, sharpening the ears and eyes, and making the **Primordial Spirit** (Yuánshén) move. The **Five Phases** (Wǔxíng) transform and generate through it.

When scattered, it blends without distinction; when gathered, it congeals into medicine—this is the **great elixir for refining the Golden Elixir**.

What is **Conducting Fire and Timing**? It is **following the Mysterious Function of the Primordial Spirit’s Qi**, the **natural path of its coming and going**.

This fire arises from the **flickering of True Essence** (Zhēn jīng huǎnghuǎ), steaming within the **four limbs and body**. Originally formless, how could there be timing?

When the **Primordial Spirit** scatters, it becomes Qi; when gathered, it becomes fire. One gathering, one scattering; one ascent, one descent—cycling endlessly, flowing without pause, moving with time and reaching its peak with time.

It aligns with **clustered years returning to months**, **clustered months returning to days**, **clustered days returning to hours**, **clustered hours returning to moments**—**Child-Midday-Morning-Evening**, **Dragon-Tiger-Snake-Horse**, **Tiger-Rabbit-Snake-Horse**, **Dawn Array and Dusk Envelopment**, **Beginning and Ending Peeling**.

It traverses the **sixty-four hexagrams**, **twenty-four Qi phases**, **seventy-two seasonal divisions**, and **twenty-eight lunar lodges**, completing the **three hundred sixty-five degrees of the Heavenly Cycle** as its timing.

Yet, how could there be years, months, days, or hours in the **undivided Chaos**? How could one measure **Jia-Yi-Zi-Hai**?

In essence, **True Fire** is the movement of the **Primordial Spirit**, and the **Primordial Spirit** is the **mysterious function of True Fire**. True Fire follows True Breath (Zhēn xī), True Breath refines True Qi (Zhēn qì), True Radiance (Zhēn xī) transforms True Essence (Zhēn jīng), and True Essence returns to the Mysterious Pass. The **Primordial Spirit** emits True Fire, True Essence congeals into the Elixir, and the **inhalation and exhalation of True Breath** are the **advance and retreat of True Fire**. The advance and retreat of True Fire are the **withdrawal and addition of the Gentle and Forceful**.

All this is **rooted in nature**, not contrived by artificial means.

Moreover, one must know that it arises with **focused thought**, like a **blaze in the wilderness**—it cannot be approached, yet how could it be extinguished? This is not the **Primordial True Fire**, but the **mundane fire of posterity**.

Now, those who cultivate the Elixir must first **penetrate the mechanisms of these three principles** and **deeply recognize their roots**. With **eyes witnessing the Dao’s presence** and **mind intuitively grasping it**, knowing with **true knowledge** and seeing with **true vision**, not allowing even a **hair’s breadth of stagnation** in the chest—only then can one begin to apply effort and establish the foundation!

At the very start of establishing this foundation, one must **sever all thoughts**, **abandon all delusions**, **advance with courage**, **attach to nothing**, **forget self and object**, **focus solely on Qi and softness**, **return the light inward**, **maintain a vacant heart and full belly**, **be dim and silent**, **preserve the void while guarding the presence**, **as if lost yet existing**, **practice steadfast stillness**, making the mind **as motionless as still water without ripples, as boundless as the void without clouds**, reaching the **utterly motionless realm of profound stillness**.

Then, within the **Mysterious Pass**, using the **pre-birth technique of before parents conceived**, one **preserves the True Breath and True Qi**, ensuring **Qi does not leave Breath, Breath does not leave Qi**, merging them as one.

The inner does not exit, the outer does not enter. Above and below circulate within this single Pass, **endlessly present**, as if in the **womb before birth**—a **single point of Primordial Ancestral Qi**, **mixed and boundless**, warm like spring, **pure like wine**, its beauty within yet radiating to the **four limbs**, filling the **four bodies**. The four bodies **speak without words**; seen, they have no form; sought, they have no shape. There is **not a single moment** when it is not within the **Mysterious Pass**.

---

When this stage is reached, the elixir ingredients return to the **cauldron and furnace**, and the **fire and timing** may now be applied!

Thus, one follows the **Mysterious Virtue** of the **Original Spirit**, allowing the **True Fire**—naturally flowing and revolving—outside the **Mysterious Pass** to circulate and refine. Gradually, it is tempered and condensed; with time, the **True Essence** accumulates, and as **power deepens and practice matures**, it grows from small to great, from subtle to manifest. The **Primordial Pearl** takes form, the **Embryo of the Sage** is sealed—all this unfolds naturally, yet its workings remain **unknowable**. It is **divine by nature**, yet its divinity is **unknowable**.

It is like the **Child dwelling in the Mother’s womb**, inhaling and exhaling in rhythm, swallowing the **Heavenly Harmony Qi** of the **Void and Supreme**, forging an **Adamantine, Unbreakable Body**. Until the **ten-month embryo** is perfected, transforming into an infant—just as when I was unborn, dwelling in the womb, sharing the same **Qi phenomena**.

Then, with **diligent cultivation**, one **refines the Qi to softness**, ever-mindful, in **movement and stillness, speech and silence**, never straying. Once **nourishment is complete**, the **Embryo transcends the shell**, and thus **splits the Primordial Chaos**, pierces the **Mixed Void**, revealing the **Original Face**—**a body within a body**.

Only then does one grasp the **Sage’s transformation of the Great**, the **Divine’s unknowability**, achieving **One yet encompassing the Ten Thousand**.

From youth, I studied **Confucian texts**, and in maturity, I aspired to the **Dao/Way and its laws**, longing for the **Great Elixir Path**. Even in **sleep and waking**, I never forgot it for a moment! Though I sought out masters in **movement and stillness, sitting and lying**, dreaming of **contemporaries who cultivated the True**, they only repeated **ancient, rotting words** from books, deceiving like **asking the deaf to listen or the blind to inquire**. Thus, I turned inward, believing that **within my heart lay a teacher beyond all others**.

Yet the more I sought, the less I found; the more I cultivated, the less it verified. Only then did I realize: **without a teacher, there is no transmission; without a teacher, there is no liberation**. I wasted years, yet never succeeded.

Later, while traveling through **Huai and Zhe**, I stayed in **Guangling**, and in my leisure, climbed a ruined city, wandering and gazing. Surveying the mountains and rivers, I **yearned for the unmet Song and Qiao**, lamenting that I had **never encountered Zhong and Lü**. Suddenly, I felt as if **something was lost**.

One night, a **Divine Person** appeared in my dream, urging me to **return swiftly**. My mind was unsettled for days.

I then took the **Dao Path through Bai Sha**, when suddenly, I encountered a **Daoist Immortal**—**ice-clear and jade-like**, with **emerald eyes and a youthful face**, his **spirit and bearing extraordinary**, transcending the mundane, as if not of this earth. I bowed and asked his name, but he remained silent. After repeated obeisance, he drew forth a fan and showed it to me—**inscribed with "Master of the Unspoken Word."** I realized he had mastered the **Mystery of the Unuttered**.

Suspecting him to be an **unusual sage**, I followed him daily, treating him as a **master**, hoping for a single word of **enlightenment**. We walked together, rested together—thus for **a hundred days**. Though I repeatedly begged for instruction, he never spoke.

One day, he ordered me to **join him at the Pass of Bundles**, passing through the **old market of Bai Sha**, until we reached a **desolate place**. There, he had me sit by the **curved riverbank**, on the **flat sands**, and **pledged by the water**. With his staff, he drew in the sand, imparting the **essence of the Great Elixir Path**—**no more than a hundred characters**—fully detailing the **cauldron, elixir, and fire-timing techniques**, leaving **nothing omitted**. He said, *"The Dao is now complete!"*

He then commanded me to **record its verification**, writing it on a scrap of paper before **sweeping it away**. I knelt and bowed repeatedly, but he did not turn. He boarded a small boat and **vanished into the distance**, his destination unknown.

Yet I never learned his name—how could I know he was not **one of the Immortals Song, Qiao, Zhong, or Lü**?

Only after receiving this **heart-transmission** did I realize my **earlier blind cultivation and reckless refining**—**wasting effort like drilling ice for fire or carving a boat to seek a sword**. How difficult it was!

My teacher’s words warn: *"He who lightly reveals them shall be condemned."* Thus, I dare not put them into writing.

Instead, I summarize his teachings in **short verses**, compiling this work titled *"The Orthodox Essence of the Great Elixir"*, to share with **kindred spirits**.

I do not seek **approval from others**, but wish to **transmit it to the present age**.

The reader may **approve or disapprove**, finding it **right or wrong**, **wrong or right**—yet if it is **right, it is right**; if it is **wrong, it is wrong**. Perhaps some may gain from it!

I know its **right and wrong**, its **truth and falsehood**—perhaps some will understand.

Thus, I write.
