**Preface to *The Direct Pointing of the Golden Elixir***
I composed *Sixteen Precepts on the Golden Elixir* (金丹十六－颂), speaking directly of the profound truths of life and nature, hence the title *Direct Pointing*.

Moreover, the cultivation of clarity and insight into one’s true nature (*mingxin jianxing*) is a matter of the *Zongmen* (宗門, "School of Orthodoxy"), while returning to the root and reclaiming one’s original essence (*guigen fuchu*) belongs to the *Xuanmen* (玄門, "School of Mysticism"). Though these two paths differ in practice and cannot be directly compared, yet the *Xuanmen* speaks of refining the elixir (*liandan*), while the *Zongmen* speaks of tending the cow (*muniu*). For since the Great Primordial (*dapu*) has already dispersed, unless one refines it, there is no way to restore the essence and return to its original purity (*fanhui huanchun*); and since the six orifices (*liu chuang*) have already opened, unless one tends them, there is no way to wash away the darkness and reveal the radiant clarity (*zaohei loubai*).

Refining and tending—though different paths, they lead to the same destination.
Mysticism and Orthodoxy—one yet two, two yet one.

From my youth, I pursued studies unlike those of the world, cherishing the Dao with earnest devotion and seeking out teachers ever more widely. In the year *Chunyou* (淳佑), *Renyin* (壬寅) of the Southern Song, I encountered *Lin Jun Ziran* (林君自然) of Chicheng (赤城), who instructed me in the elixir method (*danfa*). He further led me to bow before his master, *Li Zhenren* (李真人), and in but a few words, I grasped the essentials of restoring the Golden Fire (*jinhuo fanhuan*). He also said that if one truly comprehends one’s nature (*wu xing*), then the practice becomes all the more appropriate.

Thus, I hastened to the groves of the *Zongmen*, seeking further guidance from the elders. Later, I learned that *Fang Zhengren* (方先生) of *Zongyang* (宗陽) and *Bixu* (碧虚) had received the transmission from *Zhang Zhenren* (張真人) of *Ziyang* (紫陽). In the spring of *Jiyou* (己酉), carrying the *Direct Pointing* (《直指》), I visited him. Though my feet had not yet crossed his threshold, my heart was already illuminated by his teachings.

That summer’s end, a monk named *Yuan Can* (圓灿) passed through my place from Putian (莆田). He spoke of the *Gouzi* (狗子, "Dog-Demon") discourse, and I found our understanding in harmony. Upon examining *Bao Tai Heshang’s* (寶台和尚) *Thousand-Year Stele* (《千歲碑》), when we reached the line about ingesting lead and mercury (*fuqian gong*), I grasped its meaning and declared: "What are lead and mercury?" He replied: "They are the emotions of one’s nature (*qingxing*)." I asked: "Why so?"

I asked: "May one take them?" He replied: "They are taken in accordance with the Middle Way."

What is the Middle Way? It is neither emptiness nor non-emptiness, neither movement nor non-movement.

Yuan Can laughed and said: "I have heard of two matters—could these be the ones referred to by *Yuanxiu* (圓修)?"

Though so, the difficulty of refining the elixir is such that only those with great strength and resolve can succeed.

The following spring’s end, the Master *Hao Chang* (昊長者) of *Rongzhu Pu* (茸竹浦) marked the ground for us at *Baiyun An* (白雲庵). After practicing for half a month, the work revealed itself clearly. I took *Zhang Zhenren’s* (紫陽張真人) *Preface to the Golden Elixir* (《金丹序》) and *Chen Zhenren’s* (泥丸陳真人) *Cerulean Void* (《翠虚昤》) to verify it, and each step corresponded perfectly.

I grew ever more confident that the words of *Direct Pointing* were not in vain.

Someone said to me: "The Dao has long been obscured. You may trust yourself, but if you seek to persuade others through writing, you will only add to the confusion."

I replied: "Belief is near to knowing, while disbelief is near to ignorance. The ancients said that the Dao is neither attributed to knowing nor to ignorance—knowing is delusive perception, ignorance is forgetfulness. Let those with clear vision examine it for themselves."

In the sixth month of *Chunyu* (淳佑), on the *gengxu* (庚戌) day when the sun lingers long—
**Permanent Residence Zhou** (周無所住) of *Yongjia* (永嘉) wrote this preface.

*Direct Pointing on the Golden Elixir*
**Permanent Residence Zhou** (周無所住) records.

**Ode to the Mystic Aperture**
A single aperture opens—when one is clear, all are clear.
Not a thread of motion betrays the true void.

Within lies the True Ancestor’s essence—
Recognizing it as before yet still missing the mark.

**Ode to True Soil**
True Soil has always borne a mighty name,
Yet students seek it blindly, groping beside.
If one knows True Soil as the Middle Way,
Why ride the cow to find the cow again?

**Ode to Yang Crystal**
Pure Yang Crystal, spotless and unmarked,
A single flaw and it turns to Yin.
How many immortals never spoke of it—
Who would pause to heed its silent truth?

**On the Mystic Womb**
All things teeming, each returns to its root.
Know the source, and the Mystic Womb is passed in silence.

**Ode to Dragon and Tiger**
Dragon and Tiger rage, their thoughts aflame.
The wisdom-sword swings—both beasts are slain.

**Ode to Lead and Mercury**
To know Lead and Mercury’s natures—
Two substances harmonized, the Elixir complete.

**Ode to the True Furnace**
Head touches heaven, feet tread earth.
Within dwells One Thing, forged into treasure.

**Ode to the True Medicine**
Before heaven and earth, rootless spirit-grass.
With single intent, it yields the supreme gem.

**Ode to Scales**
Neither round nor lacking—walking the Middle Way.
Fixating forgets; obsession breeds imbalance.
Speak of the sixteen *jin* and eight *liang*—
Open-eyed, yet who is truly deceived?

**Ode to Extraction and Augmentation**
Ask of extraction’s method—
Seizing too late, the moment slips away.
Balancing without excess or loss,
Only then does Non-Action manifest.
Know the True Mind’s boundless scope—
Yet self-obscured, turned by external things.
Pitiful are those who guard the stake,
Exchanging lead for mercury in vain tricks.

**Ode to Fire and Timing**
True Fire knows no measure—
Do not force the guesswork of the age.
To grasp its essence:
Neither departure nor arrival.

**Ode to Method**
Pure ingredients, sealed with secret intent.
Twelve hours pass—
Fire stoked without a thought.

**Ode to the Oral Formula**
Intent reaches, the heart is sincere—
Still as jade, unshaken.
Day and night without pause,
Effects unfold naturally.

**Ode to Bathing**
No special art to bathing—
No need to seek the hours of *mao* or *you*.
Hunger, sleep, or meal—
Every day, spring’s gentle breeze.

**Ode to Practice**
A hundred moments in one—push forward.
One moment equals twelve hours’ span.
Twelve hours return to a single thought—
Within thought, no thought—then true marvel.

**Ode to Nourishment**
Serene, without thought or care,
Empty, letting nature take its course.
The embryo rounds—spirit transforms itself.
My fate is not decreed by heaven.

**Questions and Answers**

**Question:** *The Golden Elixir Direct Pointing* clarifies the Dao’s essence, yet the sixteen odes speak only of *xing* (性, nature). Does this not conflict with *mingxue* (命学, the study of fate)?

**Answer:** The Elixir’s essence is the enduring nature—
This is the indestructible Golden Adamantine.
It is the *Awakening to Reality*’s golden hue-body,
Manifesting the True Golden Compassion.
When the Dragon Maiden suddenly grasped the heart-jewel,
This was the very method.

Students rarely fathom their inherent nature,
Chasing outward, speaking dragon-tiger tongues,
Calling it *mingxue*—
Calling Non-Action "empty talk."

Alas, how one-sided the view!
They do not know that nature and fate exhaust each other.

Nature is fate; fate is nature.
Before the void and kalpa, they were one—
Nameless, letterless.
Once caught in speech, they split as two.

Yet stillness cannot but move—
Movement sets fate’s flow in motion.
Excessive motion returns to stillness—
Fate’s nature roots again,
Ever the void-kalpa’s body,
Unchanged, unlacking.

Motion and stillness cycle endlessly—
How could they cease?
Thus, what issues from fate is called nature,
What returns to nature is called fate—
Same source, different names.

How could one seek fate beyond nature,
Or nature beyond fate?
If one fails to grasp motion’s mechanism,
Then calling nature and fate two things—
A single word, and already mistaken.

Master Zhang of Purple Yang said:
*"If the Dao of nature and fate is incomplete,
The mind’s operation will not be universal."*

Master Bai of Azure Clarity said:
*"If one understands the *Vajra* and *Perfect Awareness* Sutras,
The Elixir’s meaning will naturally be clear—
Why distinguish between Laozi’s and the Buddha’s teachings?"*

**Question:** If Laozi’s and the Buddha’s teachings are the same,
Are Confucian teachings also the same?

**Answer:** Though teachings divide into three,
The Dao’s wealth is one.
Students’ roots and capacities differ,
Their knowledge shallow or deep—
Each clings to their own school,
Mutually condemning, all losing the source.

Yet one body inherently contains the three teachings.
If Confucianism calls the other two heretical,
It only obscures its own truth—
How could it know that from the beginning,
All was unified without remainder?

Thus, the three teachings may all enter the Dao—
Only failing to find the gate.
If one penetrates Laozi and the Buddha,
How could Confucius be any different?

Even in Confucian terms:
From Yao to Shun, Shun to Yu,
Yu to Tang and Wu, Wu to Zhougong,
Zhougong to Confucius and Mencius—
All transmitted heart-to-heart.

The Buddhist path:
From the World-Honored One to Kashyapa,
Kashyapa to Ananda—
Also heart-to-heart transmission.

The Daoist path:
From the Eastern Heavenly Sovereign to the Golden Gate Sovereign,
The Golden Gate Sovereign to the Western Queen Mother—
All mouth-to-mouth.
If the enlightened see before being taught,
They fall into the second meaning—
Then engage in lip-service,
Drowning in transaction.

Heart-transmission’s art
Lies solely in the *One* within.

*The Book of Documents* says: *"Hold fast to the Middle."*
*The Treatise on Unity* says: *"Let beings dwell in the Middle Way."*
*The Dao De Jing* says: *"Better to guard the Middle."*
This is to say: under heaven, there is no second path.

*Zhuangzi* says: *"Unified in the One, all things are complete."*
Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"Obtaining the One, all things are complete."*

**Question:** The three teachings are one—
I’ve heard Daoism speaks of form and spirit both perfected,
Or a body beyond the body.
Does Confucianism or Buddhism have this too?

**Answer:** Buddhism also possesses it.

「Take, for instance, Bodhidharma’s barefoot return to the West, the monk Pudao’s body beyond the body, Master Puhua’s alms bowl resonating with cosmic harmony, and Feikong Zhi’s empty bed awaiting supply at Yanshan—when he saw another monk ascend into the sky and depart, was this not of the same lineage?

Confucianism differs, for it governs humanity’s path, upholding the Three Bonds and rectifying the Five Constants. It is a teaching of *action* (*youwei*), yet its essence is the *Way of non-action* (*wuwei*). The Way is one, but the teachings diverge.

**Question:** If Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism share the same Way yet differ in teachings, how can Buddhism’s *chan* (meditation) and Daoism’s cultivation be the same?

**Answer:** Under heaven, there is no second Way; sages have but one mind. You have not yet fathomed the nature of the mind, hence your question. *Chan* is the practice of fixing the mind in one place—beginning with sweeping away distractions until there is nothing left to sweep. *Chan* is the Buddha’s mind, and the mind is the source of all dharmas. Cultivation (*xiuyang*) is the practice of embracing the Primordial and preserving the One, progressing until there is no cultivation left. The Way is the nurturing of the spirit, and the spirit is the sovereign of all things. Spirit is mind, mind is the Way, and the Way is *chan*.

The Great Way of non-action transcends names and forms, is beyond birth and death, dwells eternally in the void, and claims nothing. It responds when things arise and returns to stillness when they pass—like a mirror reflecting images without retaining traces. It is called the Way by force of convention. Students here may doubt it as mere talk of emptiness and stillness, yet those who grasp it know that speaking of emptiness is not emptiness itself; only when one transcends emptiness does one attain true emptiness. True emptiness is thus called *One*.

The *One* is the origin of the Great Way, the mother of the Golden Elixir, and the root of all life. Laozi says: *"Embrace the One as the model for all under heaven."* Yet the method of non-action cannot be rigidly grasped as reality, hence the *Diamond Sutra* states: *"All worthy sages differ in their adherence to the Way of non-action."*

**Question:** Having clarified that Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism share the same Way, I still seek the *Xuan Guan* (Mysterious Pass) and the *Xuan Dan* (Mysterious Female)—some say the mind and kidneys are the pass, the mouth and nose the gate, while others claim it is neither mind nor kidneys, neither mouth nor nose. Which is correct?

**Answer:** The notions of mind, kidneys, mouth, and nose were used by earlier masters to guide seekers into the Way, yet they feared obscuring the truth by making people cling to mere fleshly orifices and overlook the original, true emptiness of life’s vital pulse. Thus, they said it is *neither* mind nor kidneys, *neither* mouth nor nose—to sweep away attachment to these illusions. In truth, the *Xuan Guan* and *Xuan Dan* refer to the place where thoughts arise and cease.

Laozi says: *"The Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth."* The Purple Clarity White Immortal says: *"The place where thoughts move is the Mysterious Female."* If one can recognize the process of arising and ceasing, one knows the Valley of the Void and the Mother of Transformation. Not only do all alchemical elixirs, medicines, and fire-refining techniques stem from here, but all schools of thought, the entire Tripiṭaka, and every art and craft are contained within it.

Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"This pass has no boundaries, neither inside nor outside."* The Purple Clarity White Immortal says: *"The Mysterious Pass is boundless—vast without external limits, minute without internal confines."* Master Shi of the Peach Grove says: *"This pass is called the Mysterious Female, within which *qi* and spirit are housed."*

**Question:** Having clarified the Mysterious Pass and the Mysterious Female, what of *true soil* (*zhen tu*) and *yang crystal* (*yang jing*)?

**Answer:** *Soil* is another name for the *Middle*. Those who attain the Middle merge essence and life, achieving a serene, luminous wholeness—this is called *yang crystal*. Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"At the central, upright position, the Mysterious Pearl is produced—anciently called the birth of a luminous pearl, which is true soil."*

**Question:** Having understood *true soil* and *yang crystal*, may I inquire about the *Dragon* and *Tiger*, *lead* and *mercury*?

**Answer:** The *Dragon* and *Tiger*, *lead* and *mercury*, refer to the human mind’s thoughts. When thoughts do not cease, they rage like the Dragon and Tiger, or are as uncontrollable as lead and mercury. Master Liu of the Sea Toad says: *"One who rides the Heavenly Horse and chases the Dragon away, who tames the Earth Ox and subdues the Tiger, has mastered them."* Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"Lead flees at fire’s approach, mercury scatters at fire’s touch. If one knows the method of subjugation, the mind will naturally be without mind, and thoughts without thoughts—this is the taming of the Dragon, subduing the Tiger, capturing the lead, and controlling the mercury."*

**Question:** Having understood the Dragon, Tiger, lead, and mercury, what of the *furnace*, *cauldron*, and *medicines*?

**Answer:** The *furnace* and *cauldron* are metaphors for the body, and the *medicines* symbolize the treasures within the mind. There is no mind outside the body, nor treasure outside the mind—how could one seek medicines apart from the mind or a cauldron apart from the body? Thus, the Way is not distant from humanity; it is humanity itself that distances itself from it.

Master Huan says: *"The mind is the Heavenly Void, originally the Six Empty [hexagrams of the *Yijing*], the body is the Earthly [principle], the two are inseparably bound."* The Purple Clarity White Immortal says: *"The mind contains boundless medicinal herbs, the body contains boundless fire talismans."* Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"The mind belongs to Heaven (*qian*), the body to Earth (*kun*), hence the cauldron is called *qian-kun* (Heaven-Earth)."*

Indeed, this is but a way to urge students to reflect inward, conquer the self, and return to the origin. If one’s thoughts have not yet arisen, yet encompass all transformation, is this not the true cauldron? If one responds externally without inner agitation, is this not the true medicine?

**Question:** Having clarified the cauldron, furnace, and medicines, what of *fire-refining*, *degrees*, *scales*, and *additions*?

**Answer:** Discussions of fire-refining, degrees, and scales arise from partial adherence to stillness or movement, failing to grasp the Middle. If one forgets movement in stillness and stillness in movement—remaining still within stillness, moving within immobility—this is the balance of yin and yang in the Middle. When true soil converges, the Dao of immortality is complete.

Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"The dryness of fire and the excess of water must be harmonized, hence the scales and degrees."* The earlier masters said: *"Neither adding nor subtracting, neither extracting nor supplementing—this is the way."*

**Question:** Having clarified *fire-refining* and *degrees*, what meaning lies in the *artistic incantations* (*gōnghū kǒujué*)?

**Answer:** The discussion of artistic incantations is like the *qin*, *se*, and *yínghóu*—though they produce wondrous sounds, without mastering the skillful fingers, they cannot be played at will. How much more so for the *elixir of immortality*?

If one attains the true transmission, even a single word suffices to begin practice, and its effects manifest accordingly. One need not wait for the *month within the year*, the *day within the month*, the *hour within the day*, or the *moment within the hour*. Nor should one rely on the *five phases of the day* (子 *zǐ*, 午 *wǔ*, 卯 *mǎo*, 酉 *yǒu*), the *ten heavenly stems and twelve earthly branches* (*zhīgān*), or the *eight trigram phases* (*guàqì*) for guidance. Instead, in all *movements and stillness*—walking, standing, sitting, lying—one must maintain purity and *seal the keys* (*qīngzhēng qiànjiàn*). Then, the *yang-qi* will naturally arise.

Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"At this stage of cultivation, the **dantian** (*nǐhuán*) generates wind, the **cinnabar palace** (*Jiànggōng*) shines with moon, and the **elixir field** (*dāntián*) blazes with fire."*

Master Chen of the Dantian says: *"At first, the **spinal governing vessel** (*jīapéi guānmài*) opens; next, the **bladder meridian** (*pángguāng*) burns like fire. Within, the two **kidneys** (*liángshèn*) boil like soup, and at times, they surge and strike the **heart source** (*xīnyuán*). There is also the **cluster of a hundred meridians** (*yīcù bǎimài*), which is the essence of the practice’s efficacy."*

Yet the core of purity and sealing the keys lies in what Master Shi of the Apricot Grove (*Xìnglín*) says: *"How could one know the elixir’s secret incantation? All day long, one must dwell in the **true emptiness** (*zhēnkōng*)."*

Master Chen of the Dantian says: *"The ancient sage left behind the elixir’s incantation: **‘From nothingness, something arises—this is the foundation of the elixir.’** The *Sutra of the Mind Seal* (*Xīnyìn Jīng*) states: **‘Preserve the non-existent, guard the existent.’** Laozi says: **‘Diligently maintain stillness.’** These are the true meanings of the incantations. The teachings of past and future sages are but one tongue, one nostril—yet still, one must not stray into false paths or fall into verbal traps. Though the thousand sages differ in their methods, before the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*) wrote scriptures or the **multitude of immortals** (*qúnxiān*) formalized incantations, insects and plants, when their fruits ripen and they shed their forms, still reveal the marvels of transformation. How much more so for humans, the most refined of all creatures? The scholar must cultivate this insight."*

**Question:** Though the meaning of the artistic incantations has been clarified, I still do not understand the significance of *bathing and nourishing* (*mùyù wēnyǎng*).

**Answer:** Bathing refers to purifying the present moment (*qīngjīn*), while nourishing signifies attaining the Middle (*zhōng*). To abandon it brings stagnation; to cling to it leads to dryness. Beyond clinging or abandoning lies *nourishing*—the daily practice. A pure mind resists no dust; when all things are brought to the Middle, the Dao acts effortlessly. Effortless action is the path to all transformation.

Master Shi of the Apricot Grove says: *"Nourishing has no other technique—it is simply **‘nourishing within the Middle.’**"*

**Question:** Having grasped the essence of the *Sixteen Stanzas* (*Shíliù Sòng*), I wonder—does the saying of *forming the embryo and shedding the body* (*jiétāi tuōtǐ*) truly exist?

**Answer:** Forming the embryo and shedding the body is akin to transcending the mundane and entering the sacred. It is achieved when the mind does not cling to external things, the spirit returns to the *qi*, and the **sacred embryo is reborn** (*huànjié shèngtāi*). Nurturing this deeply, the spirit becomes complete and the *qi* transforms—this is *shedding the body*.

The ancients said: *"To follow is to be mundane; to resist is to be sacred."* The Venerable Master Xu of the Empty Stillness (*Xūjìng Tiānshī*) says: *"If the spirit departs, bring it back. When the spirit returns, the *qi* flows naturally. Morning and evening, thus practiced, the **innocent child** (*chìzǐ*) will naturally produce the **true embryo** (*zhēntāi*)."*

The Original Sage (*Běnlái Zǐ*) says: *"The spirit in the body brings life; the spirit leaving the body brings death."* Master Bai of Purple Clarity (*Zǐqīng*) says: *"A body outside the body is **shedding the form** (*tuōtǐ*)."* The *Sutra of the Pure Abiding* (*Léngyán Jīng*) states: *"The form and spirit emerge from the embryo—one becomes a child of the Buddha. The mind detached from the body, free in coming and going, is the true meaning."*

Master Zhang of Purple Yang says: *"The elixir is the **wondrous treasure of the colored body** (*sèshēn miàobǎo*), while the **Dharma-body** (*fǎshēn*) is the **true heart** (*zhēnxīn*). From the beginning, it has neither color nor sound—one essence requires no dual recognition."*

**Question:** Though the meaning of forming the embryo and shedding the body has been clarified, I still do not know how many days it takes to achieve *Yuan* (*Yuán*).

The texts say it may take *one day*, *three days*, *a hundred days*, *a year*, *nine years*, *a single meal*, or *not within three years and nine months*—my heart remains in doubt.

**Answer:** The discussions of years and months differ between the ancients and later scholars due to varying capacities and depths of practice. They merely reveal the timing of the **piercing and clustering** (*zuàncù*)—the cycles of *heaven’s cold and heat* (*tiānyī hánshǔ*), the *day and night* (*rìyè*) of humankind, and the *breath’s exhalation and inhalation* (*xīyī chūrù*).

In a single moment of practice, there lies an entire year’s worth of seasons. Within a year are thirty-six thousand moments—one can seize them all in an instant. This is called **‘grasping the pivot of yin and yang** (*zhuó yīnyáng shūjī*) and **‘stealing the creative forces of heaven and earth** (*dào tiāndì zàohuà*)—all within a single thought of the practitioner.

With a resolute mind and pure practice, when the time arrives, the principle will naturally manifest.

Master Cao of the Numinous Source (*Língyuán*) says: *"Cultivate with a single, unwavering resolve—whether success or failure, there is no fixed outcome."* How could it be limited to a set duration?

If one simply maintains purity, stillness, and effortless action, how could the **form and spirit not be perfected**, and how could one fail to align with the **true Dao**?

When one aligns with the true Dao, the elixir is but a borrowed name. The **mysterious pass and mysterious gate** (*Xuán guān xuánbǐng*), the **true soil and yang essence** (*zhēntǔ yángjīng*), the **Dragon and Tiger, lead and mercury** (*lónghǔ yīnyáng*), the **furnace, cauldron, and medicinal substances** (*lú dǐng yàowù*), the *scales, degrees, and fire-refining* (*jīnliǎng huǒhòu chōutiān*), the *artistic incantations* (*gōnghū kǒujué*), the *bathing and nourishing* (*mùyù wēnyǎng*), and all these marvelous sayings—one must not **‘seek with the mind’** (*yǒuxīn qiú*), nor must one **‘obtain without the mind’** (*wúxīn dé*). Do not cling to existence or non-existence.

Confucius, borrowing the words of the World-Honored One (*Shìjiè Rén*), and Laozi, hearing them directly—**‘hearing is not hearing, speaking is not speaking.’** A single grain of elixir is neither color nor sound; at the moment, I pluck it out for you to see—yet it cannot be swallowed as a whole. The entire body is the **incantation itself** (*kǒujué*), yet it cannot be taken in."

**Question:** The teachings on the elixir are profound yet unattainable, and the incantations of the immortals, though subtle and hidden, cannot be directly pointed to. Yet your explanations seem too straightforward—are they not excessively shallow?

**Answer:** No. The immortals wished for people to seek the Dao themselves, so they hid depth within shallowness, and people did not understand. Now, I wish for all to know the Dao, so I conceal shallowness within depth, making it easier for people to grasp.

As for Confucius’ nature and the Dao of heaven—though even his most accomplished disciples could not hear it, when Mencius spoke to Zicheng, the meaning became clear and luminous.

The **Laozi** speaks of it as **subtle, refined, and penetratingly profound** (*wēimiàoxuāntōng*), seemingly difficult to seek. Yet he also says, *"My Dao is most easy to know, most easy to practice"* (*wú dào shèn yì zhī, shèn yì xíng*), so it was never truly profound in the first place.

The **World-Honored One** (*shìzūn*) speaks of it as **hidden, secure, and distant** (*yōugù shēnyuǎn*), saying no one can reach it, which seems deep. Yet he directly points to the **human heart** (*rénxīn*), declaring that **seeing one’s true nature** (*jiànxìng*) leads to **Buddhahood** (*chéngfó*), so where is the depth?

What you call *"pointing too directly"* (*zhǐguò zhí*), is it not excessive shallowness? **The elixir’s essence is direct and clear** (*jīndān zhízhǐ jìng*).
