**Preface to *The Internal Alchemy Formula of Master Dongyuan***

In high antiquity, a million Daoist adepts attained the Dao, yet those who composed texts to guide the virtuous were but one in ten thousand! Yet when their words abound in allusions, the true source remains concealed, and the essential purport of their writings bewilders the multitude. Some compel readers to consult external classics, seeking correspondence with the primordial mystery. The analogies grow ever more intricate, the gates of elucidation ever more obscured—none but those who have penetrated the Dao can fathom them.

The sagely Dao is not inscribed upon bamboo slips; the path of cultivation unfolds along its own course. Some achieve it in ten months, others in a thousand days. The slightest misstep, and one plummets to become a ghost below. Thus, the drawer of the Eight Trigrams must array their images; the diviner of fortune must weigh their lines. The cycles of sun and moon transpire within them, and transformation resides therein.

When lines and images take form within, change manifests without—such is the great virtue of Heaven and Earth that gives rise to the ten thousand things. The sage models themselves upon this, treasuring their position. To treasure one’s position is to treasure the sage’s body—how could it refer to mere rank? When position endures, the humane abide within it; when position is lost, the humane depart. If the humane are but of innate nature, how can they cultivate? Those who know and cultivate—are they not sages?

The hare and crow race to perfect their brightness; cold and heat alternate to complete the year. The dragon crouches to seek transformation; the toad bends to advance. Essence and thought reside in spirit, and in the end, their function is attained. In stillness, one may guard the affairs of the world—divergent paths converge in the same return.

Thus, the humane secure their bodies, dwelling in silence to await their use. They exalt virtue and achievement to fulfill their being. In recent times, deluded and errant disciples, having barely grasped the Lesser Vehicle, claim to have attained the Dao. They seek only liberation through thought, styling themselves as immortals, yet they know not that the path of thought-liberation is wholly a derangement of spirit. It does not compare to the immortal who refines spirit into transcendence.

Only humans possess spirit, ever capable of self-perception. Though the eye constantly beholds it, one does not recognize it—thus the sage says it is used daily yet unknown. Suppose a scholar gazes into a mirror and beholds the reflection within—is it not spirit? Whether the countenance is fair or foul, it is revealed in the reflection. How does the reflection in the mirror differ from the scholar who gazes into it? Thus, the image in the mirror—is it not called spirit?

People see their spirit yet do not cultivate it—are they not then ghosts? Therefore, the sage says: people know spirit as spirit, yet do not know that the unspiritual is also spirit—this is the meaning.

Those who refine spirit into transcendence must first refine their form. When the form is whole, the spirit is whole. One may ask: What does it mean that when the form is whole, the spirit is whole? I reply: Consider a scholar blind in one eye who gazes into a mirror and observes the reflection—it is the same. There has never been a one-eyed scholar whose reflection was not also one-eyed. Yet if a whole scholar gazes into a mirror, the reflection is one-eyed! Thus, one must first make the form whole.

Another asks: Does spirit dwell within the human body? I say: It dwells there. Then why does it emerge when one faces a mirror? I answer: If it does not emerge when facing a mirror, that is blindness in the person—spirit emerges yet is unseen. Moreover, the spirit in the human body is like a dwelling; spirit abiding in human form is like a person lodging in a house. If entry and exit are unobstructed, the locks and bolts secure, there will be no error. Thus, when the house decays, the person departs; when the form deteriorates, the spirit flees—this is the essential Dao.

All who cultivate must first be magnanimous and virtuous, abundant in righteousness and trustworthiness, radiating kindness and generosity, shunning greed and distancing harm. They do not engage in envious or grasping conduct—this may be called clarity. They do not utter flattering or deceptive words—this may be called integrity. They rescue the drowning, save the burning, support the distressed, cherish the young, comfort the aged, aid the imperiled, deliver the endangered, reduce punishments, quell anger, deliberate in affairs, bestow kindness upon the people. They regard evil as scalding water and good as ever beyond reach. With long-accumulated hidden merits, their solar virtue naturally flourishes. They do not add envy and grasping to self-destruction, nor rely on lust and desire to self-injury. When essence is preserved, spirit is firm; when essence is exhausted, spirit departs. Thus, the sage says: first essence, then spirit; first spirit, then transcendence.

In recent times, disciples ignorant of the sagely Dao all practice purity and restraint, dwelling in seclusion among forests and springs, subsisting on coarse fare and wearing plain robes, avoiding the bedchamber. Their essence knows no leakage, and their spirit is naturally whole. This may prolong life to dwell in the turbid world. Yet when their allotted span ends, piled kindling burns them. The essence they preserved without leakage becomes a strange relic of their vows—fierce fire cannot reduce it to ash, flowing water cannot dissolve it. Thus, the scriptures say: those who cling to it do not understand the Dao and virtue—this is the meaning.

Today, people who barely enter the gate of grain-abstention and tranquility style themselves as immortals, clinging to their attachments. Alas! How truly pitiable!

Those who refine the elixir without recourse to the Eight Trigrams labor in vain. Now, I have comprehensively set forth the methods of immortal cultivation and self-nurturance, arranging them in chapters. I wish that all learners may not waste their aspirations. There is no need to harmonize them with the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* or the *Taiyi Supreme Diagram*—the principle shines forth clearly. I have expounded the essential purport in detail. Let all Daoist adepts examine and savor it.

**The Internal Alchemy Formula of Master Dongyuan, Fascicle One**

**Chapter One: The Primordial Mystery**

Those who refine the elixir do not refine common lead and mercury—they refine true lead and true mercury. The sages drew analogies to model them for the multitude. They spoke of grasping lead and casting mercury, of timely firing, and of gathering the flower—how people regret their ignorance!

The northern *qi* is called Water, and the southern *qi* is called Fire. The two *qi* of Water and Fire must be gathered at the proper time and employed on the proper day. If one gathers them at the wrong moment, even after a hundred years of refinement, it will be in vain. But if the sun and moon return to their origin and Water and Fire achieve balance, success comes swiftly.

Thus, the "elixir" refers to the Cinnabar Field. How could mere lead and mercury ever succeed? The Upper Cinnabar Field is called the Muddy Pellet; the Middle Cinnabar Field is called the Crimson Palace; the Lower Cinnabar Field is called the *Qi*-Sea, also known as the Cauldron. One draws the *qi* of Water and Fire and returns it to the Cauldron—hence the term "Furnace."

To reduce lust, cherish seminal essence, strengthen the sinews and bones, and nourish the Muddy Pellet is to refine the Upper Cinnabar Field. To cultivate a heart of loyalty, filial piety, and compassion; to bear the Way of rescue and succor; to walk in benevolence all day without ceasing; to broadly bestow aid without expectation of reward; to embrace the One and guard it, keeping one’s essence unshaken—this is to refine the Middle Cinnabar Field. To draw in the *qi* of Water and Fire and return it to the Furnace and Cauldron, never scattering one’s essence and ultimately securing the root—this is to refine the Lower Cinnabar Field.

When the three Cinnabar Fields are accomplished, how could one die? Even the forms of Heaven and Earth endure long. Cold and heat alternate; the sun and moon revolve in succession. Great mountains have clouds; vast seas have tides—all are the cyclical movements of *qi*. So too is it with humans. Thus, the eyes are likened to the sun and moon; the intestines and stomach to rivers and seas; the liver to eastern Wood; the heart to southern Fire; the lungs to western Metal; the kidneys to northern Water; the spleen to central Earth. The ebb and flow of *qi* are likened to clouds; the circulation of fluids to tides; the flow of blood and vessels to rivers; the chamber of essence in the lower origin to the sea.

Thus, the sages followed the transformations of Heaven and Earth, taking their patterns as models for cultivation—thereby attaining long life and ascending as immortals. Yet many fools exhaust their minds and spirits, clinging to their own deluded views, forgetting even sleep and meals. All day they toil, yet never see success. For the *qi* of yin and yang must be gathered at the proper time; if the moment is missed, the elixir cannot be achieved.

In the fifth month, the first yin arises, and yang wanes while yin waxes. The *qi* of yin and yang are born on fixed days and gathered at fixed times—thus the year has its months, and the day its hours. The eleventh month, the Winter Solstice, is when the first yang arises; the rest follow accordingly. Yang is to be employed, while yin is to rest. Thus, those who gather *qi* often take the midnight hour of *zi* as their time—this is the same principle. The great employment is at the Winter Solstice; the lesser, at midnight. Here, a hairsbreadth’s error leads to a thousand *li*’s deviation.

The formula states:
Common lead and mercury are not Water and Fire;
True Water and true Fire are but one.
Transformed into Dragon and Tiger, they follow in tandem.
When the Dragon moves, the Tiger does not rest.
Only on the proper day must you diligently drive them,
At midnight, the hour of *zi*, ensure their continuity.
*Qi* is the Dragon, fluids are the Tiger;
Together they enter straight into the Mysterious Palace.
If you grasp the proper time and obtain them,
That person will ascend the path to the clouds.

**Chapter Two: The Kan Palace**

*Kan* is the North, representing yin, the moon, the Tiger, Water, and *qi*. Its trigram is ☵, two yin lines with one yang—yang born within yin. Water nurtures the myriad things; *qi* gives life to the myriad things. When the primordial chaos divided, its *qi* resembled water, then yang was born. Yang dwells within the shell—like an egg, or the *Kan* trigram’s two yin lines enclosing one yang. This is the principle of yang arising at the extreme of yin.

Thus, it can generate yang. When yang arises and unites with yin, Heaven and Earth divide, and the myriad things are born—this is the source of the Dao. Heaven and Earth endure long, beginning with Water. Thus, those who refine *qi* guard *Kan*; to lose *Kan* is to lose the Mother. Without the Mother, nothing can be nurtured. Therefore, one must guard the Mother to achieve success.

Dwelling in obscurity, yet within it lies principle—this is the meaning of *Kan*! Nurturing clarity within profound darkness, obtaining the thing within the indistinct—is this not refining essence and securing the thing? When the noble person maintains integrity amid turmoil, preserves their aspiration, and nurtures *qi* in profound obscurity, they safeguard the Dao. With aspiration intact, nothing is not established; with the Dao preserved, nothing is not achieved.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"With sincerity, the heart is nourished."* Those who act while employing it do not ascend to Heaven, for Heaven is perilous. As for the Gate of the Mysterious Female, returning to the sea—if one departs from the Mysterious Female, they are lost. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"Action has its reward."* The two yin lines both proceed to pay homage to the Valley Spirit, traversing the meridians and all the peaks. Therefore, the *Kan* trigram’s image is heavy yin, yet its *qi* ascends without error, its fluids flow without disorder. Gathering must be done by the day, employment by the hour. Essence is not scattered; *qi* does not err. Traversing the paths, all return to the One.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"Water flows without overflowing, traverses peril without losing its reliability."* How true this is! Those who cultivate *qi* must constantly practice within the *Kan* Palace, circulating it with measure, day and night without fail. After a thousand days, the work is complete. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"The noble person constantly practices virtue and habituates to affairs."* It also says: *"If one does not succeed in three years, there is misfortune; if one does not complete it in a thousand days, the end is calamity."*

The *Qi*-Sea is called the Cauldron, also the Vessel. The two yin lines converge below, returning to the Cauldron’s fluids as Jade Flower. The Cauldron is called the Numinous Root; the path of *qi*’s movement is also called the Balance Hut. The taste of Jade Flower is as sweet as honey. Once it returns to the Cauldron, the Dao is first accomplished.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"The fourth line: wine in a clay vessel, a second offering in a bamboo basket—simple and sincere."* This is the image. The seal-script says...

The image of the Kan Palace is that of primordial chaos, profound obscurity, and fleeting indistinctness—where mutual generation, yin and yang, and mother-and-child arise. When its movement brings clarity to the heart, there is trust; when it flows without overflowing, faces peril without disorder, there is sincerity. Without constant practice of virtue and habituation to affairs, one will not complete the thousand-day work and meet misfortune.

The fluid of this palace, refined over time, becomes the swift and surging Jade Flower—its essence. The "wine in a clay vessel" of the fourth line represents the fluid of the two yin; receiving it in an earthenware vessel is the Cauldron. The noble person who treads this path must be cautious, for no error is greater!

The secret formula says:
*Qi becomes dragon, its fluid the tiger;
Water has bones, fire has earth.
People of this age do not comprehend yin and yang,
Nor know the root that gives birth to mother and child.
Child welcomes mother, mother follows child—
The wine’s fine taste is sweet as nectar.
Assisted into the River Chariot, borne back,
White-haired, they guard each other without death.
The Mysterious Female’s gate is sealed tight,
At ease, seated only in the Jade Terrace.
Bathed in the divine spring, impurities shed,
Hunger feeds itself by kindling the primordial fire.
After a thousand days, the work is complete, offspring born—
Thus it is said: "My fate lies within me."*

**Li Palace, Third Section**
The Li Palace is the position of the south, where the king’s virtue resides in fire—radiance and emanation. The *qi* of the Great Yang is both firm and fierce, hence its trigram is ☲, the image of Li: soft within yet firm without. With softness, it delights the firm; with firmness, it governs the soft—harmonious and compliant. When yang reaches its peak, yin arises; when yin reaches its peak, yang arises. Thus, Kan holds firmness within, Li softness within—harmonious and compliant.

The crow in the sun, the hare in the moon—such is the abundance of double brightness. Without obtaining yin’s virtue, it cannot endure. The abundance of double yin, without obtaining yang, cannot last.

In the practice of refining *qi*, one does not achieve completion by circulating only the Kan Palace, nor by circulating only the Li Palace. If one operates in isolation, yin and yang will not harmonize, leading inevitably to errors and making success difficult—like digging into the earth to seek the sun and moon.

Kan contains yang, Li contains yin; circulating them mutually completes their image. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"Raising a female ox brings good fortune."* The ox is *chou* (丑), which is yin. *Chou* is the final position of the north, neighboring Kan. When the fire of Li blazes intensely, it must be tempered by the water of Kan; without this tempering, misfortune follows. Hence, *"Raising a female ox brings good fortune."* Receiving it and returning to the Cauldron, flowing together in the Balance Hut, the body’s *qi* radiates brilliance, the complexion like ice and jade. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"The great person continues brightness, illuminating the four directions."*

Absorbing the *qi* of Li and completing it with Kan, life arises from the heart—for the heart is the Emperor Lord. One must carefully proceed without losing the proper measure; losing measure invites misfortune. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"Suddenly, it comes like fire, like abandonment."* And: *"Like death, like pouring away."* This describes encroaching upon the supreme—referring to the heart.

**Image.** The *Xiang* says...

With softness one delights the hard; with hardness one governs the soft—this is the Dao of yin and yang, their harmony. Moving Kan to complete Li, moving Li to complete Kan—this is the *qi* of yin and yang, where movement and stillness nourish each other in alternation.

Raising a female ox is to take softness to restrain hardness. *"The great person continues brightness, illuminating the four directions"*—receiving the flourishing *qi* of Li, one’s complexion shines radiantly, the four limbs are joyful and moist, free from all illness and affliction.

*"Suddenly, it comes like fire, like abandonment—like death, like pouring away."* When the *qi* of yin and yang flows smoothly, brightness encompasses darkness, dusk awaits dawn, and the Dao is accomplished in its embrace, while the form of the year is cast aside.

As for the Dao, to practice this is to ensure that primal delusion inevitably arises.

**Secret Formula:**
One tiger’s power can govern two dragons,
Together they enter and exit the Mysterious Palace.
The Mysterious Palace’s terrace and halls stretch wide as the Celestial River,
Within them contains a luminous, round moon.
In the moon, a rabbit stirs restlessly,
Drawing forth the yang crow to take flight at midnight.
It seeks the golden body, desiring to be refined in the Cauldron—
If not for the whetstone, who would dare to temper it?

The maiden of the Kan Palace is young in years,
Ever clad in dark robes, boasting of her grace.
Through the night she tends her cloud-like tresses in pairs,
Yet without seeing her true beloved, she never smiles.
Fortunately, the Li household has two fine sons,
The Three Powers complete in their majestic bearing.
They come to divine a marriage, at last content in their hearts,
Joining in union, they set out jade wine in mutual offering.

Having drunk the jade wine, they sleep in perfect peace,
With a quilt of *qi* in hues of dark and yellow, like blossoming flowers.
In the jade hall and golden palace, their hearts are bound as one,
Vowing to share joy for ten thousand years.
After ten thousand years, they swear anew,
This time to gaze together through the end of heaven and earth.
Yet once the adept has united them in bliss,
He commands her to wed the Infant instead.

The Infant’s yang *qi* is not yet complete—
Where then shall this maiden bear her descendants?

**Hexagram 63: "After Completion"**
*"After Completion"* means all is completed—great and small alike are fulfilled, hence it is called *"After."* It is also said: *"Though failing, one can stand; though leaking, one does not drown."*

Its hexagram is **䷾**, the image of *"After Completion,"* the coupling of yin and yang. Coupled yet not disordered, hence it is called *"Completion."* One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao, and the image of *"After Completion"* is just this.

For those who cultivate *qi*, one must first absorb Li after midnight, for Li’s six lines are complete, then absorb Kan, for Kan’s six lines are sufficient. Li comes first yet dwells below; Kan follows yet dwells above. Thus, above and below, water and fire achieve completion—completion that is fundamentally non-completion.

The first nine is flourishing yang, returned to the Cauldron, hence the *Book of Changes* says: *"It wets its tail."*

The maiden of the Kan Palace, originally of Li’s position, attends the Cauldron at dawn, having lost her home and become a wanderer. The first nine of Li’s realm obtains the lesser yin and lesser yang, beginning in their coupling, yet the intent is not yet dense, hence the *Book of Changes* says: *"It loses its ax."*

Seven is called *"attaining longevity"* through harmony. Drawing the *qi* from the Kan Palace, it returns to the lower Cinnabar Field to pair with Li. Practicing this for three years, its merit naturally arrives, hence the *Book of Changes* says: *"Attacking the Ghost Region, after three years one overcomes it."*

A man whose yang has declined, though aged, may serve the Dao. Knowing the function of Kan and Li, refining without deficiency, guarding the proper time without fail, he too may replenish the upright *qi*. With long and persistent practice, he may attain immortality, hence the *Book of Changes* says: *"The glutinous millet has clothing—from beginning to end, it is called vigilance."*

The *Book of Changes* says: *"The beginning is what stops the boat’s leak."*

**Image.**
The *Xiang* says...

First high then low—water and fire. The imagery of water and fire, when balanced, is the pairing of yin and yang. Water and fire enter the cauldron, thus "wetting its tail." The Kan maiden stands apart; the Li man obtains her. Without gathering to unite, he seizes her midway, hence "losing his rank." Those who attain it in seven days achieve harmony naturally. "Attacking the Ghost Region for three years"—the Ghost Region is yin. Drawing and circulating the *qi* from the Kan Palace for a thousand days, only then does success come, hence "overcoming it." For the Dao practitioner, though aged, if this refinement of *qi* is never neglected, the spirit and essence naturally replenish, thus "the beginning is what stops the boat’s leak."

**Formula:**
The Li man of the Yellow Court masters rare arts,
Abandoning home for ten thousand leagues to court the Golden Gate.
Scarcely has he entered the Golden Door when the sun is not yet high,
Yet loftily he alone upholds the steadfastness of a true man.
Ah! In the north there is a fair maiden,
Her face like peach and plum, her form like silver.
Alone she drives the River Chariot to the jade door of the Li Palace,
Coming to the Primordial Mansion to seek union.
Once their marriage is joined, heaven and earth converge,
Sun and moon circulate in constant advance and retreat.
At midnight they meet at the hour of *zi*,
Thus yin and yang achieve the *Completion of the Cauldron*.

**Hexagram 64: "Not Yet Completed"**
Yin begins, yang ends, hence "Not Yet Completed." Yet "Not Yet Completed" ultimately reaches completion—through the proper sequence of yin and yang, it finally attains balance. Its hexagram is ☲☵, the proper order of yin and yang: fire above, water below, yet able to complete itself. For those who refine *qi*, returning at noon before yin *qi* arises, drawing and absorbing it to form their body—first Kan, then Li. Thus the six yang lines are matched by six Li.

Next, when the initial yin is absorbed and returned to the Great Granary, yin *qi* is just beginning to stir, hence "Not Yet Completed." As the *Book of Changes* says: *"The little fox, having crossed, wets its tail."* This is it. The single yang of Li then enters the yin cauldron, and the union is obtained, hence "ultimately completed," using firm strength to rescue the yielding. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"Dragging its wheels—steadfastness brings good fortune."* This is it. With firmness guiding the yielding, yin restraining yang, the noble man’s Dao harmonizes with the petty man. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"The noble man’s radiance holds sincerity."* This is it. Through the rescue of "Not Yet Completed," "Completion" is attained.

The noble man obtains emolument and secures his household;
The Daoist obtains blessing and secures his person.
As the *Book of Changes* says: *"The topmost yang holds sincerity in drinking wine."* This is it.

**Image.**
The *Xiang* says...

The "small fox crossing" speaks of the fox as a yin creature, its strength slight and subtle—if it seeks to cross, it must first wet its tail! The yin creature refers to Kan; yin is obtained by yang, and Kan resides at its center, where firmness and yielding harmonize in joy, thus "dragging its wheels." The noble man’s Dao first humbles itself before attaining honor, first avoids blame before achieving steadfastness. Dwelling in the time of "Not Yet Completed," he is thus weak among the people, but after "Completion" is ultimately achieved, he must rise above them. Hence, "the noble man’s radiance holds sincerity." Beneath "Completion," one secures the body and knows destiny, obtaining Heaven’s emolument, thus "holding sincerity in drinking wine."

One yin and one yang occupy the positions of firmness and yielding. Without force, one follows the Dao of Heaven, circulating its qi—hence "ultimate completion." The formula states:
*Within the Mysterious Palace, doors and locks are probed,
A maiden of sixteen, graceful and refined,
Long lamenting that no matchmaker comes to her gate,
She rests her chin, alone in her tower’s solitude.
Unbeknownst to her parents, she slips from her chamber,
Her beauty revealed as she wanders the streets.
With unhurried steps, she seeks the Yang Chamber,
Entering the Dragon Palace with no strength left.
There she meets the Yang Lad driving his fiery wheel,
Untimely they knot their pendants and swiftly wed.
Yin and yang alternately restrain each other—
The Dao of long life must ultimately be completed.*

**Chapter Six: "Not Yet Completed" and "Completion"**
"Not Yet Completed" begins with yang and follows with yin; "Completion" begins with water and follows with fire. In the preceding hexagram images, Heaven precedes Earth—this is the proper order of yin and yang. The moon precedes the sun—this is the Dao of mother and child. Thus, in union, the One gives birth to the myriad things.

All who cultivate qi must do so at the proper time. Having grasped the timely application, first employ the four yang lines, then the four yin lines, then again four yang to unite them, forming the twelve images. Then, in turn, first employ four yin lines, then four yang, then again four yin, uniting them into the twelve hexagrams—here the work is complete.

The formula states:
*When the Great Yang first arises, the moon begins its motion;
While the Great Yang has not yet waned, the moon must advance.
Ordinary folk speak of the moon’s slow birth,
Yet in one night it circles the heavens twelve times.
When you move, I too depart;
When I advance, you do not stay.
Together we follow for a thousand myriad autumns,
Meeting where place and time align.
Without the proper place, do not act recklessly;
Without the proper time, do not apply carelessly.
Examine deeply and guard firmly—
Let no common person know that I am the immortal and you are the mortal.*

**Chapter Seven: The Qian Palace**
Heaven and Earth first nurture the qi of yin and yang, thus Kan and Li precede Qian and Kun. The sun and moon move within Heaven and Earth—speaking in terms of proximity, Qian and Kun precede water and fire. The盛ness of yang virtue moves without weariness: at first, it is misty and obscure; in the end, it becomes visible. Unyielding, it never ceases; tempered, it never retreats. Vigorous, it can act; firm, it does not deviate. Gathered, it is as minute as a hair or mustard seed; expanded, it pervades the myriad things. It may be revered but not intimately approached—this demonstrates its loftiness. It may be observed but not fathomed—this demonstrates its numinosity. Unceasing throughout the day, never losing its subtlety—this is the essence of Qian!

Its hexagram is ☰. For those who cultivate qi over time and abide in Qian, their virtue and power are firmly established. Heaven and Earth transform and give birth to the myriad things; following their transformations, one likewise nurtures change. One must act in accordance with the time, drawing in singly and receiving it. That which is received is called the Azure Dragon. The first yang begins its journey, its strength still subtle, unable to transform. It extends its position, and the noble man endures hardship while awaiting its盛ness. As the *Book of Changes* says: *"The first nine: The hidden dragon—do not act."* "Do not act" means it is not yet time to act.

Drawing it again and extending it, it arrives at the victorious ground. Yang virtue resonates and suddenly盛s, blazing forth, shining brilliantly, and settling resplendently. Its power can universally aid and occupy the central position. Positioned at the center, it harmonizes above and below in Heaven. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"The second nine: The dragon appears in the field."*

Drawing it forth and further extending it, its image is completed. At the utmost height, without treading on doubled firmness, one cannot yet be at ease. The noble man reduces his thoughts, guards against desires and pleasures, cultivates virtue and power as his city walls, severs benevolence and righteousness as his shields and screens, is cautious in speech and secretive in pivotal matters, embodies the profound and obscure while observing the manifest. He attains the end of the time without negligence, practicing his Dao. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"The third nine: The noble man is ceaselessly active all day, vigilant in the evening as if facing danger—no blame."*

Qian originally has no name. When drawn forth and put into motion, it is imitated and symbolized; when forced and enacted, it is named after myriad things. When the single qi flows and expands, jade-like radiance surges and streams, infusing the numinous source, each governing its position. After a thousand days of work, one’s ability to transform is witnessed. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"Clouds move, rain falls, the myriad beings take form. The great light begins and ends, riding the six dragons to drive Heaven."* The Dao of Qian transforms, each rectifying its nature and destiny. The noble man receives its image.

Before the numinous fungus sprouts, its root is just planted. Drawing it again and extending it, yang virtue becomes盛. When one line resonates, no affair is short-lived—thus one obtains its benefit and profits the body. Having profited the body, one must firmly guard it, without indulging in idle thoughts. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *"Origin is the leader of goodness; prosperity is the gathering of excellence; benefit is the harmony of righteousness; steadfastness is the trunk of affairs."* Here, the Dao of *origin, prosperity, benefit, and steadfastness* is complete!

**Image.**
The *Xiang* says: *"The hidden dragon—do not act"*—the noble man’s Dao begins subtly. *"The dragon appears in the field"*—the Azure Dragon emerges from concealment, its virtue about to be employed, ascending to the cauldron. *"Ceaselessly active all day, vigilant in the evening—no blame"*—the Dao’s beginning becomes manifest; the warning lies in desire. *"Proceeding to act"*—clouds move, rain falls, the fluid qi flows together. *"The great light begins and ends"*—the work of a thousand days.

**Oral Formula says:**
The noble one’s Dao begins as clarity—
Do not act, do not employ, nor strive in practice.
If the single dragon returns again to the primal cauldron,
Luminous and penetrating, discourse reaches the numinous.

Fire seeks dryness as clouds follow the dragon,
Echo answers sound as wind attends the tiger.
Preserve the Valley Spirit—if it does not die,
The Azure Dragon shall not gallop to foreign lands.

Drive and chant, summoning it into the Great Yang,
Allowing transformations to unfold by their own power.
If the driving and expelling do not move,
Ten thousand hosts shall fall to ruin.

Refine no cinnabar, bind no mercury,
Nor meddle with yin-yang’s charcoal and fire.
Since ancient times, countless households have been undone—
All saw immortals, yet none received their welcome or send-off.

Welcome has its method, send-off its place;
Secure the golden chamber, array the precious vessels.
Array the precious vessels—ground them well,
Arrange dragon and tiger according to their stations.
Do not let water and fire’s natures fall out of harmony,
For such a one shall surely gain the *qian*-origin’s benefit.

**Hexagram *Kun*’s Chapter, the Eighth**
Of heaven and earth’s Dao, none is greater than yin and yang.
When yin reaches its extreme and surges, yang must govern it;
When yang waxes in hardness, yin must subdue it.
Once governance and submission are settled,
Dragon and tiger find peace, and their positions become firm.

Thus, heaven and earth’s virtues unite, sun and moon pair,
The four seasons follow their order, ghosts and spirits align in fortune or misfortune—
Such is the greatness of the Dao’s mechanism.
The Dao of *Kun* is to comply and yield,
Softly submitting and guarding itself, giving birth to the myriad things.
Preserving integrity and benefit, bringing the myriad things to completion.

Its hexagram is formed thus: *Kun* means compliance.
The Dao of soft compliance preserves and completes the body,
Then integrity and benefit follow.
For those who refine *qi*, it must be gathered in season,
Pressed and ingested, so that heaven and earth’s Dao
Neither errs in cold nor heat.
When cold and heat do not err, all affairs endure in harmony.
Heaven’s Dao unites in accord, then preserves the great and endures long—
Thus the *Xiang* says: *"Complying and receiving, heaven’s resting virtue unites,"*
An unbounded kind.

At first, subtle yin takes charge;
Next, mature yin reveals its pattern.
From concealment to manifestation,
Virtue unites with the Grand Real—
The noble one who employs it meets with unbroken fortune.
Thus the *Xiang* says: *"The noble one’s virtue is thick, bearing all things,"*
As in *"Treading frost, firm ice approaches."*

The *qi* of Yellow Bell, gathered and concentrated,
Delights the four limbs.
When the four limbs are harmonious, its Dao is excellent—
Thus the *Xiang* says: *"The earth’s Dao shines,"* and *"Six in the third: containing brilliance."*
It also says: *"Yellow skirts—supreme fortune."*

Before heaven and after earth, receive it in the cauldron.
When the two *qi* have merged, essence and *qi* overflow in abundance.
Yin reaches its extreme, and yang restrains it—
Thus the *Xiang* says: *"Dragons battle in the wilds, their blood dark and yellow."*

**Image.**
The *Xiang* says:

Upholding the blessings of heaven, yin’s virtue is yang—
Treading frost, firm ice approaches, from the subtle to the manifest.
Six in the third contains brilliance, the thickness of earth’s virtue.
Dark and yellow blood—essence and *qi* of heaven and earth.
Thus the *Yi* says: *"Dark and yellow—heaven and earth intermingled,"* for heaven is dark and earth is yellow, and their Dao is luminous!

**Formula:**
Yellow Matron has a daughter, her face like gold,
Yet without a worthy matchmaker, her heart finds no peace.
Vigilant in chastity, her resolve pure as ice and jade,
Let Zhang San or Li Si dare not trespass.

The Heavenly King has a son, in his prime of years,
First abiding in the central palace, enacting virtuous governance.
Following the path, he strides forth from another gate,
Then unties the golden ring to secure eternal stability.
Eternal stability demands a thousand days of effort—
The household’s radiance and prosperity shall emerge.
Children born surpass their parents,
Scarcely parted from the womb, they are already robed and combed.

**Hexagrams *Dui* and *Gen*, Ninth Chapter**
*Dui* is joy—firm within, yielding without, aligning with heaven in response.
*"O man, three days!"*
At the waxing moon, yang flourishes while yin wanes.
Thus the practitioner of *qi* must, in due season, draw the Azure Dragon from the lofty palace,
Absorbing the number nine to augment yin’s insufficiency.
When yin wanes in its position, summon yang to replenish it—
Its hexagram is *Dui*, halting at the full moon.
One must cease replenishment then,
For over-replenishment disrupts the balance of yin and yang.
At sixteen, yin prevails and yang is deficient—
The practitioner must, in due season, draw the White Tiger from the *Kan* palace,
Absorbing the number seven to replenish yang’s *qi*.
When yin prevails and yang is weak, its hexagram is *Gen*—
*Gen* is stillness.
Stillness must be timely: when it is time to act, act; when it is time to halt, halt.
The noble one’s Dao encompasses waxing and waning, ebb and flow.

*Gen* is the mountain, *Dui* is the marsh—
The images of mountain and marsh are here made clear.
First *Dui*, then *Gen*, thus the hexagram *Sun* is obtained.
The meaning of *Sun* is vast indeed!
The Dao of *qi*-practice concludes here—
The work nears completion.
Diminishing above to augment below,
Extinguishing to preserve and engendering anew.

For all who absorb *qi*,
Three days before and after each month, cease the circulation of *qi*—
This is called *"extinction,"* aligning with heaven’s timing.
This is the supreme Dao.

**Formula:**
When yang’s *qi* wanes, move the Azure Dragon—
At one and nine, the initial work bears fruit.
When yang’s *qi* flourishes, augment the White Tiger—
The work of three and four follows measure.
Yin and yang decline—there are constant rules.
The sage who knows them replenishes accordingly.
How to replenish with the supreme Dao?
Three days before and after—heed the prohibition.
If cultivation does not follow heaven’s timing,
It differs not from the common folk.
Arrange the sequence and adhere to the positions—
A deviation by even a hair’s breadth spells great error.
Without knowing the positions, do not boast idly—
A thousand efforts will but ruin the household.

**Chapter on Transforming Images, Tenth**
When the six lines move, the eight trigrams arise;
When the eight trigrams surge, good and ill fortune hang in the balance.
The noble one observes the images of *qi* and examines their transformations—
How can he escape their sway?

Thus, fire first and water after yields *Jiji*;
Water first and fire after yields *Weiji*;
*Li* first and *Qian* after yields *Heavenly Fire*.
The image of *Heavenly Fire*—the *Yi* says *Tongren*,
The noble one who unites the aspirations of all under heaven.

First *Xuanwu* and then the White Tiger yields *Earthly Water*.
The image of *Earthly Water*—the *Yi* says *Shi Zhen*.
He who attains *Shi Zhen* receives heaven’s favor.
Reversed, the images differ.

Practicing *Kan* and *Li* concludes in the ninth month;
Continuing *Kan* and *Li* follows likewise.
Alternating *Kan* and *Li* in like manner,
Riding the Dragon and Tiger in the third month—
Then the transformation is complete!

*Dongyuanzi’s Inner Alchemy Formula, Volume One—Concluded*
*Dongyuanzi’s Inner Alchemy Formula, Volume Two*

**Chapter Eleven: Water and Fire**

When the Dragon and Tiger have formed their images and ninety days have passed, settle the spirit and calm the intent, silently guarding the empty chamber. Gaze fixedly and hold the body firm, driving away water and fire until the intent scatters and ceases.

The formula says:
The Golden Crow flies into the Moon Palace,
Yang flames blaze fiercely, the intent unwavering.
Like a bounding hare entering the high palace,
A single wheel of autumn water flows without cease.
Exchanging heads and altering faces, none know,
As creation’s transformations unfold in their time.
Men transform into true women,
Daughters become sons of men.
Within this, matters are often inverted—
The exchange of yin and yang is the Dao.

The Kan maiden dons yellow robes,
The Li lad reverses to black.
Men refine and obtain yellow gold,
Their every movement clearly content.
The maiden’s heart, once frozen, now rejoices,
Sitting in the shade of crimson gauze without fanning.
Who in the Li Palace remains unchanged?
The yang line stirs and casts itself into the Pearl Pavilion.
The form and image stand clearly as Qian—
Who dares say yin and yang are mistaken?

Who claims the Li Palace stores only water?
Water’s nature flows in circles without fixed abode.
Near yang, it grows hot; near water, cold—
Its gentle, compliant nature is beyond compare.
From this, heaven and earth birth the Yellow Sprout,
The Yellow Sprout itself blooms as golden blossoms.
If one can gather and refine it as a lifelong practice,
Know only fullness, loading the River Chariot.
The River Chariot returns to its master’s place,
Even in famine, one suffers no hardship.
Only by giving birth to one’s own descendants,
Never mistake others for father and mother.

**Chapter Twelve: The Burning of Demons**

Demons are the toxins gathered from the five grains. Every five days, they arise once from the Kan Palace, halting at Li, flaring forth in all directions to spread their five poisons.

The formula says:
The seasons’ nodes must always be avoided.
Fire naturally dwells in the depths of the sea,
Yang flames blazing, piercing water’s clarity—
Without movement, nothing great can be achieved.
Suddenly surging forth from the Dark Spring,
When the Dragon moves, the Tiger yields the path.
Rushing straight into the Palace of Great Yang,
The fiery Han gathers its flames in that moment.
The Li troops unite, raising spears and halberds,
Ten thousand oxen charge through the Cinnabar Field.
The Demon King surrenders, hands bound,
In an instant, the Three Corpses’ realm is burned away.

Who sits alone within?
Secretly sealing the Ghost Pass with a firm lock,
Burning to the ends of heaven and earth—
No being can steal from me.
All things steal from man in countless ways,
Others encroach upon his fields.
Guard and protect them, never let them be tilled—
Once broken, there is no means to sustain life.

Carefully observe and await the moment without error.
Plan three days or five in advance.
If they clearly intend to seize what is yours,
Strike with fire and reduce them to hot ashes.
If three burnings fail to drive them away,
Seek another path to soar aloft.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Meeting**

The meeting (*jiaogou*) is an encounter, where the true Dragon and true Tiger meet in their time—hence *gou*.

On the day the Dragon and Tiger meet, one must avoid the Primordial Fire day and also the days of heaven and earth’s seasonal nodes.

The formula says:
The Azure Dragon lingers long in the Southern Marchmount,
The White Tiger hides deep in the Northern Sea.
If the Heavenly Talisman does not descend to urge them,
They rest, nestled in the cliffs of the hollow peaks.
The Lord Emperor issues a decree, extending a cinnabar summons—
Shaking off their scales and wings, they leave the ancient path.
Breaking through the yin clouds, they release lightning,
Their full horns rise and fall, vying with the sun’s brilliance.
Following heaven’s leftward turn, they rush to the Yang Valley,
The rosy clouds lock away the Yellow Gold Chamber.
Commanding the White Tiger to emerge from the Dark Palace,
A faint smile stirs a pure breeze.

The pure breeze circles to the right,
Entering straight into the Fire City.
Within the city, affairs are unburdened—
First, seek peace and stillness.
Thus it is done thrice,
Moving without haste.
If Dragon and Tiger can be mastered,
One is already a divine immortal.

**Chapter Fourteen: Primordial Fire**

Fire is not the fire of Li—it resides in the Kan gate. The kidneys are the root of the body’s unity; if one harms them, the body perishes—hence it is called *primordial*.

Kan is yang within and yin without—thus it is called *Primordial Fire*.
Therefore, the sage accumulates this fire,
Warming the chamber so the myriad spirits all settle in their abodes.
If the chamber does not glow, the myriad spirits depart.
Those who can bear and move it—it is complete!

The formula says:
The four seasons begin with their flourishing days.
After midnight, first arrange Li and Kan,
Opening the great Fire City of the south—
Within the city, a spring sweet as honey.
A cup, clear to the profound depths,
Nurtures the Golden Crow to avoid old age and death.
Who would deliberately breach the sand dike,
Allowing the current to flow freely so boats may cross?

Collapsing in a rush toward the Primordial Head,
Startling the Jade Hare into hasty flight.
Avoiding the nets and snares, it bursts straight from the navel,
Plunging into the Yin Pass, traversing nine li.
Meeting the Muddy Pellet, it still does not stop,
Only upon seeing the Azure Flower does it turn back.
Suddenly, warmth fills all under heaven—
The myriad demons flee to their origins.

In an instant, within the autumn down,
Each returns according to its rank to the Crimson Palace.
The toad flies into the bright moon,
While the Golden Crow ascends the white sun.

**Chapter Fifteen: Bathing**

Those who cultivate and refine must purify their bodies.
To purify the body, nothing surpasses bathing.
Bathing is not the fragrant waters of the mundane world!
The immortals’ song declares: without water, how can one be cleansed?
Thus, the water that is not water is true water.

The source of true water is exceedingly subtle.
Stored and used, it lasts through kalpas without end.
Held in an autumn hair’s tip, it cannot be filled;
Encompassing heaven and earth, it cannot be contained.
Thus, those who use it—unless they are sages—will surely drown!

The formula says:
The Golden Crow flies swiftly before noon,
Arranging the Kan trigram as the uncle commands.
Then, release the Northern Sea’s spring,
Forcing the Jade Toad to dwell in the dry place.
Waves surge, pouring into the southern lands,
Engulfing a thousand mountains and ten thousand peaks.
A single wheel of autumn moon cascades through the sky,
Assailing the flesh and bones with piercing cold.

Stirring the southern *bing ding* fire,
It dares not rest securely within the city.
Riding the golden wheel, it rushes to the Moon Palace,
Coming to join the toad spider for a time.

The lingering waves surge forth from an autumn hair’s tip,
Vast and boundless, swelling into towering billows.
The Azure Dragon naturally guards the Primordial Yang Sea—
Who dares cast a rod to hook the giant turtle?

The Perfected One bathes within,
Taming his hair, his youthful face, his brows ever green.
For he has loved purity all his life,
And finds no satisfaction in floating or sinking all day.

The Palace of Li is all water,
While the Chamber of Kan is pure yang.
How wondrous the transformations of creation—
Heaven and earth expand and contract!

Who preserves this esoteric art?
Dragon and tiger do not long remain hidden.
A single grain of medicine is all it takes—
The woman is inverted and becomes a man.

**Chapter Sixteen: Mother and Child**
The child is not nurtured without the mother,
The mother is not preserved without the child.
If nurturing loses the Way, the mother is lost;
If preserving loses stillness, the child is lost.
Should mother and child gather and never scatter,
The Dao is perfected!

The formula says:
The three hun and seven po
All reside within the human body.
Only spirit and intent,
These two must mutually communicate.
Preserve them, lest they scatter—
This is the beginning and end of the Great Dao.
If mother and child unite as one,
How could the serpent fail to become a dragon?

**Chapter Seventeen: Embracing the Origin and Guarding the One**
Since ancient times, all sages and worthies who attained the Dao
Emerged from this path.
Those who attained the Dao yet did not fully master it
All longed to cast off the mortal form—this is what they meant.
Even today’s Buddhist monks,
Who enter samadhi and sit in transformation,
Have all understood the Dao and grasped its essence—
This is called "yin liberation," akin to the Daoist "corpse liberation."

To cultivate this secret Dao, there is a crucial key,
And its formula lies in the mouth.

The formula says:
Embrace the Origin without deviation, and the Dao is complete;
Embrace the Origin and deviate, and immortality is assured.
Guard the One without losing it, and all matters are fulfilled—
My life is in my hands, not in Heaven’s.

Within the Cinnabar Field, there is a thing fiery as flame,
Its flavor bland yet sweet as honey.
Simply abide in profound stillness without wavering,
And day by day, your essence will grow more radiant.
When the time comes, shift to the Crimson Palace,
Where carriages and horses naturally come and go.
At times, the Valley Spirit draws near,
Entering and exiting through the Mysterious Gate of heaven and earth.

At first, one step, then two,
Ten steps, a hundred, swirling like the wind.
One *li*, two *li*—yet you do not walk to reach them,
A hundred *li*, a thousand—gone without a trace.
When exiting, the gates and barriers are secured,
Layer upon layer of hexagrams are recorded without carelessness.
If thieves harbor ill intent to plunder,
You will arrive within a thousand *li* in an instant.

Do not take worldly Daoists lightly—
Do not mistake your own treasure for another’s.
If you can fully repair your palaces and dwellings,
You will enter and exit freely within them.

**Chapter Eighteen: Destiny and Calculation**
Those who awaken to the Dao and cultivate late,
If their cultivation is incomplete and their destined time has not arrived,
Cannot escape death to ascend as flying immortals.
Yet if they know their destined time has come and can evade it,
They become earthbound immortals—
Only then can they cultivate the Dao of ascending to the heavens.

The formula says:
The lifespans of mortals vary in length,
But the great destiny draws near day and night.
If the spirit’s light departs from the gate of qi,
The fire of the three burnings will not turn back.

Knowing the destined time has come, one must flee—
In profound stillness, the Mysterious Pass is firmly secured.
Before your eyes, many claim to be immortals,
Some trailing vermilion sashes and wearing crimson pendants,
Holding the *Taishang Xuanyuan* talismans,
Humbly entreating you to join them.
They speak of ascending to the heavens in various ways,
Inviting you to rise with them to the Ninth Heaven.

If they speak thus, do not listen;
If they wish to accompany you, be cautious and do not contend.
Simply know to close yourself within the vermilion gate,
And declare to the Mysterious Palace: "I seek great stillness."
Let your spirit wander a thousand *li* beyond mountains and passes,
Waiting for them to depart before returning to observe.
After the spirit departs, a divine breath remains—
This breath was bestowed by the immortal master’s golden mouth.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Spirit Light**
Modern Daoists adopt vulgar notions,
Claiming that to perceive the spirit light,
One must gouge the eyes with one’s hands—
This is all incorrect!

The Dao arises naturally;
Why forcefully seek it?
What is obtained through force
Cannot be called the Dao or virtue.

Simply sit facing east before the fifth watch’s rooster crows,
Close your eyes, still your thoughts, and abide in the realm of no-light.
Wait for a moment, and the spirit light will arrive of its own accord.
It may resemble the images of the sun and moon,
Or the light of a lamp or candle,
Spiraling up and down, vanishing and reappearing.
Wait patiently, and with closed eyes, it will come.
If after three days it does not arrive,
Your destined time has come—
Hasten to evade it!

The formula says:
Simply know to close your eyes and dwell in the Mysterious Chamber;
At midnight or the hour of *zi*, it will often emerge.
Sometimes like lightning, it suddenly appears,
Chasing the flowing waves, floating and sinking.
Sometimes like the sun and moon, it blazes brilliantly,
Or like a divine pearl, it dazzles with fivefold light.
Illuminating all things clearly,
Half white, half red, it fills the Grotto Chamber.

If it does not come and your destined time arrives,
Swiftly lock your gates and retreat.
Flee to distant mountains and old hermitages,
Do not follow Zhang San or Li Si.
The magic mirror must be frequently consulted—
Discern the immortal’s threads with care.
Left-spinning, right-turning, growing familiar with its comings and goings,
You will witness the lofty forest where the cicada sheds its husk.

These words are not exhaustive, yet mortals remain deluded.
To speak fully would risk leaking heavenly secrets.
Do not say cultivation has no gate—
It is only that immortals have their own paths and forks.

**Chapter Twenty: The Essential Summary**
When cultivating the hexagrams and their lines,
Wind and rain do not act.
After wind and rain pass, then enact the hexagrams Kan and Li.
Do not divine on the dark moon;
Complete the twelve lines,
And arrange the thirty-six.

Kan and Li continue for nine months with water and fire,
Then nine months combining Kan and Li,
Forming the *jiji* and *weiji* hexagrams.
Another nine months rectify Qian and Kun,
Three months for the Dao’s transformation—
Seclude yourself in the Mysterious Chamber,
And in a hundred days, it is accomplished.
In total, a thousand days are required!

For those whose vitality is depleted by sensual indulgence,
Even a thousand days cannot restore it—
One must practice for a long, long time
To replenish the Yang Barrier.

Kan is one yang and two yin,
Fire is born from water—
This is the natural Dao.
Those who indulge in desires
Exhaust their single yang.
When the single yang’s power is spent,
A person approaches death.
Thus, one must supplement it with the qi of original harmony!

When supplementation is complete, a person is reborn!

Now, heaven is high and earth is low—thus the Dao of yin and yang is arrayed. In every movement and stillness, the positions of firmness and softness appear. Like attracts like, kindred spirits gather, and from this gathering comes division—thus the principles of fortune and misfortune are made manifest.

Heaven displays its images in the sun, moon, and stars; earth establishes its forms in mountains, marshes, grasses, and trees. The six lines intermingle and transform, yin and yang unite—wind and rain bring moisture, thunder and lightning strike, autumn departs and spring arrives, cold retreats and heat advances. Above and below communicate, the sun waxes and the moon wanes.

Dragons rise and clouds follow; tigers stir and wind arises. The Dao of dragon and tiger may be drawn near but not kept distant, may be subdued but not commanded. When they rage, they harm people; when they are intimate, they endure. Enduring, they grow great; growing great, they endure long. The virtue of the worthy is thus complete, their work perfected!

The sages established the *Yi*’s images to discern survival and decay—this is the foundation. *Yi* means change: only when the Dao reaches its utmost does transformation occur. Thus, the *Yi*’s images are likenesses, and likenesses are visions. Through vision, one perceives them, communing with spirit and illumination—where spirit and illumination abide, the Dao of long life is complete! Therefore, it is called *xiang* (image).

Thus, the noble person knows when to advance and when to retreat, when to be soft and when to be firm. They turn night into day, transform yin into yang, dwell in chaos yet remain tranquil, reside in peace yet stay vigilant. They immerse themselves in its flavors, delight in its wonders. In movement, they observe its divine radiance; in stillness, they examine its soul and spirit. Though a thousand miles distant, they grasp its patterns. Without a thousand days of cultivation, its achievement is not complete. Therefore, heaven must aid them—fortune will be without fail, for this is the Dao that encompasses heaven and earth.

Gazing upward, they observe the patterns of heaven; looking downward, they examine the principles of earth—thus they know the causes of the hidden and the manifest. Tracing beginnings to return to endings, they understand the discourse on life and death. The wandering soul becomes spirit; original *qi* becomes matter. Spirit and matter must be complete, with nothing leaking—leakage leads to the collapse of the vessel. Those who do not know this see the wandering soul as monstrous, speaking of ghosts. The forms of ghosts and spirits reveal gains and losses: losing, one becomes a ghost; gaining, one becomes a spirit. They follow the essence of the sun and moon’s movement, unite with the nature of dragon and tiger, model the completeness of heaven and earth, and connect the hidden and the manifest of day and night.

Spirit has no fixed direction yet comes from all directions—thus it has direction. The *Yi* has no form yet arises from form—thus it has form. In every movement and stillness, the Dao of yin and yang—who can fathom it? Life is death, and death is life; yin and yang transform, and those who continue them flourish.

The Dao of sages and worthies is used daily by the people, yet they do not know it. Thus, the sage relies on the Dao to reveal it—this is called *ren* (benevolence). The wise illuminate it through patterns—this is called *zhi* (wisdom). They conceal its essence to await the benevolent; the noble person’s abundant virtue is thus made manifest. Therefore, the *Yi* says: "Daily renewal is called abundant virtue," and "Production and reproduction is called the *Yi*."

Abiding in their chamber, they know its numbers; by its light, they examine its signs. Above, they emulate Qian; below, they model Kun. The Dao of Qian and Kun thus enables creation and transformation. The *Yi* says: "To exhaust the numbers and know the future is called divination; to adapt and connect is called affairs; the unfathomable of yin and yang is called spirit."

Movement and stillness have their proper times; gain and loss follow constant principles. Gaining this, one loses that; gaining that, one loses this. One day and one night, one cold and one heat—day is bright and night is dark, yet sometimes reversed. Cold and heat come and go, sometimes deviating. Thus, it is called *zhan* (divination), *xiang* (image), *yi* (change). Those who excel at thoroughness are called *dong* (penetrating); those who excel at completion are called *xuan* (profound).

**Expansive Mystery, Chapter Twenty-One**
*Expansive Mystery* expands the meaning of *Dongxuan* (Penetrating Mystery). Heaven and earth are formless yet give birth to the formed; male and female have no image yet nurture the imaged. Relying on the imageless, form arises; relying on form, names are established. Thus, to forcefully create is called heaven and earth, male and female, life and death.

Life arises from nothing to become something; death arises from something to become nothing. To gain from nothing is the Dao; to lose from something is folly. The foolish do not gain through the Dao. To know being as being is being; life is when original *qi* has not yet dispersed and can be taught. When it scatters, yin forms, and yin’s beginning is born—fully storing the knowledge that nothing is the root of being.

Thus, at a male’s birth, *qi* is concentrated, solidifying his form. The nine orifices form, and when complete, he is nurtured. Yang *qi* is pure and substantial—thus his image corresponds to Qian. Qian is strength; desires have not yet arisen. He drinks blood, and likes and dislikes touch him—anger arises cautiously, like the profit of merchants, for his *qi* is purely yang.

At first, a person’s gates are firmly closed, guarding the One and purifying their spirit. By ten years of age, they can stand upon what they see. The Dao of civil and martial arts is extended to grasp its essence—his hexagram is *Gou* (Encounter). *Gou* means meeting, the beginning of the north, where strength is not yet mature. The strong boar has five yangs, and when it encounters, it stirs the body. Crowned and robed, it is influenced by *Gu* (Decay), its ambition confined to the chamber. Two yangs both retreat—thus the *Yi* says: "The lord does not know that nothingness is the one yang beginning to descend." The four *xi* (joyful states) are greedy and lustful desires have not yet arisen. The six lines do not stir—playing with them is amusement, restrained by ritual and music. The mouth savors flavors, and desires arise accordingly. Thus, the first nine: one yang is initially defeated, its power beginning to return to its position—this is *Hai* (the twelfth earthly branch).

The *Yi*’s *Yingzhu* (Lean Boar) encounters the strong boar: the lean boar is one yin, and the Dao of lust is about to sprout. "Heaven below has a mountain"—*Dun* (Retreat) will diminish its strength. Should it join? A person halts here, and the many boars encounter harm.

Upon reaching the capping ceremony and marriage, they are employed—thus their hexagram is *Dun* (Retreat). *Dun* means to avoid and withdraw, for yin *qi* is growing while yang has not yet departed—this is to distance oneself from petty people.

The petty person is the woman; the noble person knows the Dao and can secure their person. Desire can destroy one’s person—when yin is in full ascendancy, one must guard against indulgence in pleasure to reinforce the *Dun* (Retreat), thereby strengthening yang’s resolve.

By thirty, one’s blood and *qi* are robust, and the affairs of family and household are established. Descendants follow in succession. If one serves the state with loyalty, official profit will flow unceasingly; if one repays enmity with solemnity, the courage of resolute decisiveness will not be restrained. Coveting profit for the household, one desires that a thousand generations will not diminish it; seeking rank through poisonous office, one desires that nine promotions will not suffice. Yet they do not know that lust is the axe that hews at life, and rich flavors are the medicine that rots the intestines. Thus, when the three yang lines show deficiency, the hexagram becomes *Pi* (Stagnation).

"Heaven and Earth are *Pi* (Stagnated)": *Pi* is not strength. The firm has already departed by half, and the yielding occupies its fullness. Therefore, in the prime of life, though one’s complexion may flourish and one’s *qi* may be fierce, if one follows desire without restraint, the virtue of firmness and strength will daily diminish. Outwardly strong but inwardly weak, the *Yi* thus calls this "outwardly a noble person, inwardly a petty person." If one halts at this point and does not cultivate and refine, daily depletion will occur. Thus, the *Yi* speaks of "the great departing and the small arriving"—the Dao of the petty person lengthens while the Dao of the noble person wanes.

The noble person, knowing otherwise, understands that the great departs and the small arrives. They must moderate diet, be cautious of lust, secure the root and stem, embrace the primordial, and guard the One to dissolve yin. Thus, the *Yi* says, "The noble person, through frugal virtue, avoids calamity"—this is the meaning.

By forty, descendants stand in abundance, the path of lust has passed its peak, and teeth and hair approach twilight. Thus, the four yang lines show deficiency, and the hexagram becomes *Guan* (Contemplation). "Wind moving over the earth" is *Guan*. The nine in the fifth place is the ruler, and the ruler is the heart of the people. At forty, if lust is not yet sated, one can still repent—repenting the failures of the body. Thus, by observing the form with the heart, one is cautious in the bedchamber, sincere in curbing desire, and employs this to replenish the *qi* of primordial harmony. The noble person halts here and cultivates; the petty person does the opposite and destroys. One who is not cautious at forty will thereafter be abandoned. Thus, the *Yi* says, "The six in the third place contemplates the advance and retreat of my life"—the Dao is clear.

At this stage, through diligence in cultivation, using yang to supplement yin, one can still avoid loss. Thus, the *Yi* says, "The nine in the fifth place contemplates my life; the noble person is without blame." By fifty, if one does not uphold this Dao, yang virtue falls into disorder, and yin ghosts daily grow stronger. Thus, the nine in the fifth place shows deficiency, and the hexagram becomes *Bo* (Splitting Apart).

"A mountain above the earth" is *Bo*. *Bo* means to fall, like the grasses and trees falling in autumn. The initial six splits the foot—splitting begins from the subtle. The foot is what a person treads upon; without feet, one cannot go anywhere. Thus, the *Yi* says, "*Bo* splits the bed’s foot." The bed is where a person rests; if it is split, it is not beneficial. What brings rest is the person’s body. The body’s having form is like the bed’s having a place to stop. If the bed is ruined, the form cannot rest; if the form withers, the spirit cannot dwell. If the spirit departs, the form is surely lost. Great is the meaning of *Bo*! The firm changes into the yielding, yang into yin, the upright into the ominous. Yin *qi* thus flourishes, and the Dao of the petty person lengthens. Thus, the *Yi* says, "It is not beneficial to have somewhere to go."

If one does not awaken at this point, the affairs of profit from carriages and huts become manifest. By sixty, if one does not supplement the Dao, the walls show collapse, the house shows ruin, and the person shows demise.

When yin flourishes and yang perishes, the *po* laughs while the *hun* grieves. Proceeding in compliance, the exalted dragon suffers loss—its hexagram becomes *Kun*. *Kun* is compliance; its name is Earth, its form is soil, its nature is yielding, and its affairs are abundance.

When a person reaches sixty and fails to cultivate and refine, pure yin fully arises: the liver’s Dao declines, the lung’s Dao withers, the heart’s Dao grows dull, the spleen’s Dao decays, the gallbladder’s Dao weakens, and the kidney’s essence is exhausted. Once these six conditions are complete, death ensues, and one becomes a ghost—hence the saying, "Ghost means return." The *hun* returns to heaven, the *po* returns to earth. Thus, following *Qian* is life, following *Kun* is death; the Dao of life and death is revealed. Those who know and refine reverse the *Kun* Dao!

Therefore, the *Yi* calls *Qian* and *Kun* the gateways of the *Yi*. The *Yi* is the book through which the sage transforms life and death. If one understands its Dao at sixty, one still cultivates and refines! By refining yang to dissolve yin and replenishing the *Initial Nine*, the hexagram becomes *Fu*. Thunder beneath the earth is *Fu*: firmness moves, and yang returns within—its root is revealed! The root is the heart of heaven and earth.

For all people, awakening at sixty to cultivate the supreme Dao is to restore their origin. One must revolve the *Kan* and *Li* on the solstice, employing them in due season, without losing their measure. Perceiving what is seen, one silently guards the self, abiding in great stillness, following its governance to return to the root. Thus, the *Yi* says, "*Fu* reveals the heart of heaven and earth." It also states: "The former kings closed the passes on the solstice, halting merchants and travelers." The *Yi* speaks of profound tranquility—great stillness—by which the former kings modeled themselves on heaven and earth.

The *Image* says: "Returning from not far away is for cultivating the self." Diligently and tirelessly, morning and evening, one strikes to secure great stillness, replenishing the *Sixth Two* to complete true yang. Then the hexagram becomes *Lin*. Marsh above earth is *Lin*: yang *qi* regains its abundance, while yin *qi*, though lush, daily diminishes. Thus, the noble person’s Dao lengthens, and the petty person’s Dao wanes. Persisting without rest, even in the yin months, one does not lose principle. As firm *qi* encroaches and daily spreads, there is no misfortune. This is called restoring the *Qian* hexagram—its affairs are peace!

Thus, the *Yi* says: "By the eighth month, there is misfortune." The eighth month is the height of yin’s multitude; failing to refine yang to dissolve it ultimately brings misfortune. Great is the meaning of *Lin*! It restores heaven’s number. Thus, the *Yi* says: "Firmness centered and responsive is the way of great success and correctness."

If one can recognize misfortune and uphold firmness, cultivating the three yangs to restore them, the hexagram becomes *Tai*. Earth above heaven is *Tai*: the noble person accumulates virtue and piles up deeds, refining yang to dissolve yin, daily sprouting progress without cease. The nine orifices flow smoothly, the four limbs are full and substantial, movement and rest are harmonious, and the myriad spirits are at peace. Yin *qi* daily diminishes, yang *qi* daily grows. Within, one is firm and strong, walking upright; without, one is yielding and harmonious. Proceeding thus brings universal benefit. Therefore, the *Yi* says: "Heaven and earth unite, and the myriad things are at peace. The noble person’s Dao lengthens, and the petty person’s Dao wanes." This is its meaning.

Persisting without cease, daily advancing the Dao, dissolving the *Sixth Four*, the hexagram becomes *Dazhuang*. Thunder above heaven is *Dazhuang*: strength follows heaven’s Dao, the shock of thunder arouses the myriad things, and none fail to stir. The noble person observes *Qian*’s Dao, exhausts *Qian*’s work, and acts accordingly! Abiding in great stillness, no demons arise, no perverse affairs stir. Gazing at *qi* with the heart, all distracting thoughts are severed. Filth is washed with true water, illness is cauterized with primordial fire. The last remnants of yin are incinerated by yang in a single day—at this, the petty person’s Dao perishes!

Firm correctness arises within and manifests without. Though outwardly yielding and compliant, how can it be restrained by the flourishing of yang? Yet the Three Corpses plot rebellion, and the Seven *Po* await departure—only reverence for firm strength prevents them from boasting of their expansion. With yang’s virtue reigning supreme, it is called *Great* and *Strong*. Thus, the *Yi* says: "Upright and great—thus the sentiments of heaven and earth are revealed!"

Cultivating without cease, transforming at the *Ninth Five*, the hexagram becomes *Guai*. Marsh above heaven is *Guai*: the noble person cultivates the self and guards conduct, vigilant day and night without slackening. One examines penal cases, pities widows and orphans, rescues the drowning, supports the fallen, quells jealousy and expansion, roams the spirit and moves *qi*, embraces the origin and guards the One, refines the great yang to dissolve yin *qi*. When the petty person’s Dao wanes, one attains *Guai*—*Guai* means decision. At this point, there is resolution in the Dao of liberation.

In general, the noble person’s life begins at the *mao* horn—this is called complete yang. Halting at ten years, lacking the *Initial Nine*, the hexagram becomes *Shou*. If at the *mao* year one does not yet know cultivation and refinement, by twenty the hexagram becomes *Dun*. If at twenty one can cultivate and refine, nurturing and preserving the *Initial Nine*, the hexagram becomes *Tongren*. Heaven and fire are *Tongren*. By thirty, if one can fully preserve the true Dao and restore the *Initial Nine*, the hexagram becomes *Wuwang*. Thunder moves beneath heaven—*Wuwang*. By forty, if one can examine misfortune, guard the One, and remain silent without seeking, restoring the *Initial Nine*, the hexagram becomes *Yi*. Thunder is *Yi*. By fifty, cultivating the supreme Dao and replenishing the *Initial Nine*, the hexagram becomes *Yi*. Mountain and thunder are *Yi*. At twenty, replenishing *qi* and reaching the *Ninth Two*, the hexagram becomes *Lü*. Heaven above marsh is *Lü*. By forty, restoring the *Ninth Two*, the hexagram becomes *Zhongfu*. Wind above marsh is *Zhongfu*. At forty, tirelessly practicing *qi* to refine yin and replenish the three yangs, the hexagram becomes *Xiaoxu*. Wind moves above heaven—*Xiaoxu*. By fifty, understanding the Dao and practicing essence without slack, replenishing yang *qi* to the *Ninth Two*, the hexagram becomes *Sun*.

Mountain below marsh is called *Sun*. Yang *qi* ascends to dissolve yin, thus the *Book of Changes* speaks of "diminishing above to augment below." At fifty, knowing the Dao of *Sun*, if one can diminish the *Sixth Three* and transform it into the *Ninth Three*, the hexagram becomes *Daxu*. Heaven within mountain is *Daxu*. By sixty, free from delusion and practicing the Dao to the utmost, diminishing above and strengthening below with *qi*, refining the *Sixth Four* to achieve pure yang, the hexagram becomes *Dayou*. Fire above heaven is *Dayou*. If one draws in the four images of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, yet miscalculates the rhythm of extraction and circulation, the eight trigrams will dissolve and transform anew—thus completing the sixty-four hexagrams. The sages expounded the *Changes*, and the Dao of transformation and change was fully revealed.

When yang flourishes and yin recedes, immortals become visible. When yin flourishes and yang recedes, the hun and po may depart; if the hun and po depart, one dies prematurely, but if immortals appear, the body undergoes liberation. The Dao reaches its utmost! Though one may travel a thousand *li*, one need only turn inward and smile. Therefore, the noble person observes the Dao of high heaven, grasps it, and practices it—purifying the five flavors to cultivate the body, nurturing the five constants to refine conduct. To be plundered by thieves is the way of human life, but the sage reverses the plunder.

Heaven and earth are vast, the sun and moon luminous; day and night alternate, the positions of high and low are fixed, the gates of ghosts are sealed, the horse of the mind does not gallop—all rests in one’s hands. When the mechanisms are secure and stillness is firmly established, in all comings and goings, one attains the freedom of myriad transformations, for the power of change lies within the body.

The greatest in heaven is humanity; the greatest in humanity is *ji*. Following heaven to circulate *qi*, adhering to the principle of the times to subdue *ji*—if *ji* does not leak, primordial yang is firmly consolidated. Refining yin into yang, the Dao of *Qian* becomes ever more manifest. Once the position of *Qian* is established, the foundation of *Kun* is firmly set.

When yang flourishes and yin dissipates, yin *qi* scatters—thus heaven arises to slay the heart, and dragons and serpents collapse. The noble person casts out the Three Corpses, binds the demon hordes, drives away the Azure Dragon, expels the White Tiger, overturns and inverts them. Day by day, month by month, one departs from pure yin and enters pure yang of *Kan*—thus heaven and earth are reversed! When the positions of *Qian* and *Kun* are fixed, human affairs are firmly enduring. External evils cannot enter, and inner yang flourishes. Guarding the One without loss, embracing the primordial to fulfill one’s aspiration, one awaits the cicada’s molting—leaving the decayed form behind. Thus, the Dao of heaven and humanity unite, the foundation is discarded, and the spirit emerges.

Heaven and earth give birth to humanity, with fixed lengths of life; whether clever or clumsy in nature, one may freely roam and shift the spirit, for it can be concealed or hidden. Ears that hear, eyes that see, noses that smell, mouths that taste, hearts that toil in labor and desire—all these diminish longevity. The noble person can close the eyes within, becoming blind to colors; block the ears without, accumulating silence; seal the nose from things, mastering scents; shut the mouth from delicacies, cutting off flavors; refrain from laboring the heart, preserving longevity; and not coveting desires, securing the foundation.

Thus, when the eyes behold beauty, the heart grows fond; fondness leads to movement, making it hard to forget. Therefore, seal the nine orifices so that evil cannot enter—this lies in blinding the eyes and stilling the heart, being cautious of the three desires. In movement there is loss; in stillness there is gain—this is the way.

The heart can store, yet the heart can also ruin a person. The heart is the sovereign ruler, governing the myriad spirits. When the heart is in chaos, excessive desires arise, and the myriad spirits scatter—death approaches! Thus, wood gives birth to fire and burns itself; a state gives rise to treachery and rebels against itself. If a man knows that the eyes must not gaze upon beauty, the heart must not be disordered by desire, and the mouth must not crave flavors, and thus cultivates and refines to preserve the body, he is a sage.

Heaven and earth employ benevolence to give life, but humanity employs the lack of benevolence to kill—this is the constant way of human life. In the seasons of *Qian* and *Kun*, the hundred grains and grasses steal the time to emerge; humanity steals the autumn to consume the flavors of the hundred grains and grasses. The poisons of the hundred grains and grasses steal human life. The noble person stabilizes the Three Powers, preventing theft from arising. Only then, with the water of *Kan* and the fire of *Li*, does one cook and consume at the proper time—thus the hundred bones regulate themselves. Therefore, the former kings, on the solstices, closed the passes so that merchants and travelers did not move—this is the principle.

People recognize the image of the spirit as the spirit, yet do not know that the spirit dwelling within the body is the true spirit. The spirit within the human body, when refined, becomes an immortal—thus it is called spirit. The Dao of liberation from the corpse follows the movement of the sun and moon: left rotation and right setting, right rotation and left setting—its number is three.

Stabilizing the body, cultivating the spirit, abiding in the chamber, cutting off thoughts—only then does minor stillness begin. With a hundred days of effort, progress becomes evident. Next, attaining great stillness, a thousand days of practice accumulate. When effort is evident and practice accumulates, the radiance of the spirit emerges—thus the numbers of the sun and moon. Whether great or small, the effort is the same. The numinous is born of this, and the sage’s work is established by this. The noble person, in poverty, holds fast to the Dao and does not leak *ji*; the petty person does the opposite.

Calming the child, quieting the mother, embracing the primordial and guarding the One—one’s aspiration remains undisturbed, and evil naturally retreats. Refining hardness to dissolve softness, accumulating effort without weariness—like the deaf who see, the blind who hear, demonstrating singular focus. Cutting off profit from the One is the way. Cutting off profit from the One, effort increases tenfold. The sun and moon rise and set, cycling three times. When the Dao is accomplished in the One, the filthy form will fall away, and the luminous spirit will emerge—thus effort increases a hundredfold!

What the heart desires is what it discards, thus it is born from things. What humanity loses is one’s own gain. Gaining and being able to guard without loss through the Dao—control lies in the heart, and circulation returns to the primordial. Thus, the bird in *qi* dwells in the dark chamber, silently guarding the Dao, profoundly without care—it may come and go. The person decays, but the spirit stands.

Thus, life is death, and death is life. In all circumstances, movement shifts the lines, and they may gather or disperse. The sun and moon have their measures; hardness and softness refine each other. Where there is merit, there is duration; where there is duration, there is flourishing—thus the foundation of the noble person is firmly established!

With each advance and retreat, the Dao of transformation is made clear. Through hardness dissolving softness, the principle of *Qian* and *Kun* is revealed. Therefore, the wise person abides in silence, finding peace in their dwelling, seeking the perfection of cultivation and refinement.

A bright mirror stands beside them, radiating its light—then the true forms of ghosts and spirits become visible! The common people use it daily yet do not know it. They apply it to things and restrain it in *qi*: in movement, it is hard; in stillness, it is soft. Observe its form and appearance, await its advance and retreat—then the way of fortune and misfortune is decided!

Thus, one who cultivates and refines knowledge is called a sage—is this not its meaning?
