*The Zhouyi Cantong Qi Dingqi Ge Mingjing Tu*
Annotated by Peng Xiao, Gentleman for Court Audiences and Acting Vice Director of the Bureau of Sacrifices in the Ministry of Rites, Bearer of the Purple Gold Fish Tally

**Ode of the Tripod Vessel**

Xiao divided the *Cantong Qi* into ninety chapters, corresponding to the "nine yang" number, including four supplementary sections titled *Supplementing Omissions and Rectifying Errors*. The *Ode of the Tripod Vessel*, originally placed before the *Supplement*, is preserved here separately—its phrases interlinked, its lines fragmented—to correspond to the "one water" number.

**The Ode:**

Three and five, round,
The tripod’s circumference: one foot five inches; its hollow center: five inches.
Zhang Sui’s annotation states: This is called the *Taiyi Furnace Method*.
Round as heaven, square as earth,
Its form like a floating gourd, or the shape of the human body.
Three tiers, symbolizing the Three Elixir Fields.
Thus, the Three Luminaries, Five Phases, Four Images, and Eight Trigrams are all contained within.
One inch one fen thick.

The mouth measures four by eight,
Its inverted opening like a golden cauldron’s pot,
The outer lip upturned and folded,
Circumference approximately three feet two inches,
The bright center spanning one foot across.
A two-inch lip.
The upright rim encircling,
Two inches high.
Length one foot two,
The tripod’s full height: one foot two inches,
Water enters eight inches from the top.
Thickness even,
The entire body one inch one *fen* thick, uniformly so.
The belly aligned,
The tripod’s body—top, middle, and bottom—straight and equal.
Suspended to retain warmth,
The tripod hangs within the furnace, not touching the ground—this is the *Suspended Womb Tripod*.
Yin above,
The upper water tripod moistens below.
Yang rushes upward,
The lower fire ascends to blaze above.
Head and tail martial,
*Si* and *Wu* mark the boundary of yin and yang:
*Si* is the yang rat’s tail, *Wu* the yin boar’s head—thus the fire is martial.
The center civil,
Between *Si* and *Wu*, yin and yang advance and retreat,
Each attaining the mean—thus the fire is civil.
Beginning with seventy, ending with three decades,
Two hundred and six, well-tempered and even.
Seventy, three decades, and two hundred sixty,
Together totaling three hundred sixty days,
Corresponding to the great number of the celestial revolution.
Within this, carefully temper and harmonize the fire,
Lest the great reckoning of heaven and earth be lost.
Master Wei sought to pair and complete the verse,
Thus dividing it as such.
Yin fire white,
When fire meets yin, it is said to be white.
Metal and water find their use, hence much white and little red transform into *Yellow Sprout Lead*.
The Yellow Sprout arises from lead,
Lead is the mother of the sprout.
Two sevens gather, aiding and sheltering the adept.
The two sevens—
As stated in a later section: *"The Azure Dragon dwells in the sixth chamber of the House, the White Tiger in the seventh of the Ease,"* and in the lower scroll’s eighty-second chapter.
This signifies the qi of the Azure Dragon’s seven lodges and the White Tiger’s seven lodges,
Converging to nurture the divine embryo,
Aiding and sheltering to give birth to the *True Person of Numinous Mercury*.
The tripod vessel establishes the Three Powers,
The central palace is the human—
Thus the middle section states: *"The True Person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming within the compass,"* as in the middle scroll’s sixty-sixth chapter.
Nourish the brain, stabilize the ascent of the mysterious.

The Child dwells in the center, secure and preserved.
The Golden Mother of the Spirit Chamber nurtures and rears the True Child of Mercury.
As stated in an earlier section: *"Warmly nourish the Child-Pearl,"* in the twentieth chapter of the upper scroll.

Coming and going in roaming, never leaving the vessel.
Gradually growing great, nature and essence pure.
The Maiden and the Infant, sheltered and nurtured by the Mother,
Become the barrier and the strike—
The tripod vessel firm and steadfast.
The Original Path cannot escape,
Only within the vessel does it ascend and descend, swim and drift.
As the days and months revolve in cycles,
It gradually refines into pure essence.

Returning to the One, restoring the original source.
At first, the Water Mother serves as the foundation of the elixir;
The Water Mother then gives birth to its Mercury,
Thus it is called returning to the One and restoring the origin.

Cherish and revere as lord and minister.
After a full cycle, the labor is arduous.
Guard closely, never grow confused or dull.
A year’s toil is strenuous—
Attend carefully to protection,
Lest negligence arise.

The path is distant, again profound and mysterious.
If you attain this, you will comprehend Heaven and Earth.
The Dao of the elixir is subtle and obscure, its purport deep and far-reaching.
If one can fathom it,
It is as if Heaven and Earth lie in the palm,
The sun and moon rest in the heart—
Nothing is beyond reach.

When the *daogui* is imbibed, the hun and po grow tranquil.
The Golden Elixir of Returned Cinnabar:
When the *daogui* permeates the five viscera,
The spirit refines the qi to clarity,
The hun is at peace, the po is still.
The mortal bones are transformed,
Becoming those of the True Person.

Those who attain longevity are the worthy children of the *hao-sheng* virtue.
Seek out the root of the divine medicine and cultivate it,
Never err by employing杂 miscellaneous substances.

Examine the Five Phases and determine the precise weights.
In refining the Returned Cinnabar,
The root of fire revolves with the clepsydra’s marks,
Moving in mutual exchange.
First investigate the nature and essence of yin and yang,
Scrutinize the Five Phases,
And distinguish the weights in fractions—
Only then will there be attainment.

Thus Immortal Cao said:
*"The Golden Elixir connects with the divine immortals,
Its practice is present everywhere,
Yet it is bound as a thing."*

The white-haired are not spared,
For the immortals cherish it.

Know the true Lead and Mercury—
One Water and one Stone.
The Central Palace first serves as the master,
Water and fire are bound as a thing.

The two substances become husband and wife,
Husband and wife pair and match.
A hundred marks reach the qi of *li*,
Cinnabar emerges from this.

Thus we know the Golden Elixir of Returned Cinnabar
Is not apart from yin and yang, the Five Phases,
The true Lead and true Mercury.
When they harmonize to form the medicine,
There is no other path.

Ponder this deeply, no need for further discourse.
Guard it in concealment, do not transmit the text.

Let those who would refine their essence and delve deeply into thought not speak of it lightly. Seal it within the heart, for if recklessly transmitted in writing, one will surely incur heavenly punishment. Mounting the white crane, riding the scaled dragon, roaming the Great Void, and paying homage to the Immortal Lords—receiving the celestial charts, one is titled a Perfected. After the elixir is accomplished, merits fulfilled and virtue abundant, one receives the register and charts, attains the rank of Perfected, and verifies the proofs of the Dao—is this not so?

In the *Eulogy and Preface*, Zhu Xi of Huian remarked... (This may be the words of Attendant Xu.) The *Cantong Qi* conceals its words yet embodies the great Dao, speaks subtly yet holds profound meaning. It arrays the Five Thearchs to establish enterprise and aligns with the Three Sovereigns to govern. If ruler and minister are disordered, above and below lack standard; if governance follows such sequence, great peace will not be achieved. Exotic methods of ingestion cannot confer longevity, nor can learning to nurture nature extend years. Yet when yin and yang are dissected and their weights harmonized, when the crescent and full moons, the eight trigrams form images, when male and female act, hardness and softness move and still, when grains and salts are distinguished—using the classics as evidence—its intent is resolute.

Thus it establishes laws to transmit to later worthies, elucidating the great image to attain longevity. Those who follow our Dao must attend to this earnestly. The disciples described by Master Wei are all metaphorical expressions: ruler and minister, father and son interchange; male and female, husband and wife alternate—this is the sequence of divine medicine receiving qi and undergoing transformation. If hierarchy is unstable and ruler and minister lose order, the foundation of the great elixir collapses and cannot stand.

Moreover, within the four chapters of the *True Contract*, only the gate of supreme medicine is expounded, revealing the ancestral lineage of Lead and Mercury. There are no separate methods of ingestion nor various arts of nurturing nature, lest people stray from the true path. Therefore, it reiterates the intent of cultivating the elixir: without exception, it relies on yin and yang, sun and moon, movement and stillness, hardness and softness, division and judgment, Kan and Li, harmony and union, male and female—following the eight trigrams, dividing the two crescents, the fire tally of zi and wu, the dawn and dusk of pi and tai, merging south with north, uniting east with west. They mutually receive qi, intermingle their essences, and thus form the Returned Elixir.

All who share this aspiration must attend to it earnestly. Wei Boyang condensed the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi*, illuminating the secrets of elixir cultivation. Thus he pointed to the root of medicinal substances beginning with the same kind and demonstrated the advance and retreat of the fire tally ultimately requiring mutual restraint. His exposition is thorough and meticulous, so that his instruction to later generations is urgent and essential. If scholars of the world read it with sincere hearts and study it deeply, they will surely perceive its subtleties and understand its meaning.

Yet this work was composed in the Han era, its diction profound and elegant, replete with ancient rhythms. Later readers, possessing but shallow knowledge, recklessly altered its text. By the end of the Five Dynasties, Peng Xiao divided it into chapters and provided interpretive explanations, which may indeed be called a true aid to the classic. However, his annotations perpetuated errors, sometimes extracting passages out of context—such as Zhu Xi’s remark, *“Thus the* Zhouyi *governs the heart of Heaven, and how could it not be steadfast?”*—which properly belongs to the following chapter. Though the great meaning is clarified, the ancient text remains fragmented in intent. Peng’s *Explanations* were also later tampered with by shallow scholars of recent times, leading to such confusion.

Now, the versions preserved in the imperial archives and those transcribed among the people abound in discrepancies, omissions, and redundancies, leaving no authoritative recension. Recently, Master Zhu Xi, concealing his name, undertook a collation, examining and rectifying the text with reasoned evidence, thereby restoring much of its authenticity—a version worthy of reliance. Yet no reliable edition of the *Chapter Divisions and Explanations* exists. The recension by Zheng Huan of Lin’an, though claimed to be thorough, contains numerous errors. When compared to the original text, it often diverges; when measured against other versions, its coherence falters.

In my humble post, burdened with official duties, I have, in moments of respite, taken up this work and read it, finding it increasingly compelling. Thus, I have collated multiple editions, establishing a definitive text. For the main body, I largely follow Zhu Xi’s original. For the *Comprehensive True Explanations*, I broadly adopt Zheng’s version. Where most editions agree, I defer to the majority. In cases where the *Cantong Qi* text and the *Explanations* diverge—such as the *Qi* stating, *“Combined, they form sixty,”* while the *Explanations* read, *“Combined, they form the sixty-four hexagrams”*; or the *Qi* declaring, *“Then water stabilizes fire,”* while the *Explanations* say, *“Restraint then stabilizes water”*—I preserve both, allowing them to stand side by side. Though this may not be perfect, it at least clarifies the essential meaning of the elixir classic.

According to Peng’s preface, Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi* after obtaining the *Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic*. Today, this book exists, yet it lacks the archaic profundity of the *True Cantong Qi*. Some speculate it may be akin to the *Three Tombs* texts or the *Fox-Head Classic*, though this remains uncertain. Nevertheless, the text itself predates the Five Dynasties. After his *Explanations*, Peng further wrote the *Illuminating Mirror Diagrams and Secrets*, intending to unlock the gates of the *True Cantong Qi*. Here, I place the classic at the beginning of this volume, followed by its secrets, uniting them into a single work. May those of discernment examine it carefully.

Now, carved into blocks and circulated, it is shared with fellow seekers to together verify the supreme Dao.

On the fifth day of the eleventh month in the cyclical year *wuchen* of the first year of the Jiading reign (1108), coinciding with the winter solstice, Bao Huanzi Zhongqi, *Tongzhilang* and Magistrate of Jianyang County in Jianning Prefecture, concurrently overseeing agricultural affairs, respectfully inscribed this.

**Illuminating Mirror Diagrams**

Having completed the chapter divisions and explanations of the *Illuminating Mirror Diagrams*, I humbly observe: the *True Cantong Qi* speaks in subtle terms of the profound Dao, its text expansive and its principles abstruse. Though its three scrolls are interconnected from beginning to end, and the cyclical rise of the Five Phases is clearly expounded by the perfected ones, I fear that the dull-witted among later learners may struggle to comprehend it. Thus, I have once again distilled the *True Cantong Qi* and composed the *Illuminating Mirror Diagrams and Secrets*, arranging eight cycles to correspond with movement and stillness, clarifying the two images to determine yin and yang. The profound mysteries of the *True Cantong Qi* may then be grasped at a single glance.

**The Secret States:**
The workings of creation lie hidden, their traces unfathomable;
The true secret, clustered here, guides the uninitiated.
Three scrolls conceal their mysteries within eight cycles,
While the myriad phenomena unfold within a single mirror.
The *Li* maiden rides the dragon as the Wood groom,
The *Kan* man mounts the tiger as the Metal anvil.
Those who cherish the Dao should study it with precision—
Master it, and the path to longevity lies open.

The supreme Dao is subtle and profound, wondrous yet abstruse;
To refine the elixir, first recognize the heart of the Great Return.
The solar line, yin and even, births true mercury;
The lunar trigram, yang and odd, yields pure metal.
The woman conceives cinnabar, the man gestates snow—
In the north, Mars conceals *bing*, while *ren* is contained within.
The two poles point to the ancestral lead and gold—
Do not seek them haphazardly among the myriad forms.

**The Solar Image and the Qi of Fire**
The sun is yang, yet within yang lies yin—
Like cinnabar containing true mercury.
When yang is excessive and yin deficient, it cannot radiate its spirit,
Thus it is called the "female fire," for yang harbors yin within.
Within the sun dwells the crow; its trigram belongs to the south,
And it is the *Li* maiden.

**The Lunar Image**
The moon is yin, yet within yin lies yang—
Like lead containing true silver.
When yin is excessive and yang deficient, it cannot nourish its essence,
Thus it is called the "male metal," for yin harbors yang within.
Within the moon dwells the hare; its trigram belongs to the north,
And it is the *Kan* man.

**The First Cycle: The Essence of Metal and Qi**
The Four Images and Eight Trigrams form the gates of heaven and earth,
With humanity arrayed among the eight directions, mutually engaged.

**The Second Cycle**
The path of ghosts and spirits, the twenty-eight constellations—
Illuminating the celestial revolutions and the fire numbers, beginning with *tianyi*.

**The Third Cycle**
The thirty phases of waxing and waning—
Uniting the monthly fire numbers, corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams in mutual application.

**The Fourth Cycle**
Fifty black dots, fifty black-and-white dots—
The numbers of yin tally and yang fire in a hundred notches, corresponding to the celestial tally’s movement and stillness.

**The Fifth Cycle**
The twelve hexagrams—
Clarifying the monthly progression and retreat of line images, the rise and fall of dragon and tiger.

**The Sixth Cycle**
The twelve earthly branches—
The fire times of ascent and descent, drilling and merging, revolving the celestial tally.

**The Seventh Cycle**
Displaying the fire numbers of the celestial revolution—
Converging the four seasons to correspond with the inner images.

**The Eighth Cycle**
Arranging yin and yang, the Five Phases, and the myriad phenomena within the crucible—
Assisting the metal and water, dragon and tiger, the *Li* maiden and *Kan* man in their union,
Together generating true cinnabar and true mercury, thus completing the Reverted Elixir.

**On the *Cantong Qi*:**
*Can* means "to intermingle"; *tong*, "to penetrate"; *qi*, "to unite."
It signifies that its principles align and its meanings converge with those of all elixir scriptures.
In refining the Golden Liquor Reverted Elixir, one must first seek the primordial root of heaven and earth;
Next, investigate the images of yin and yang’s division;
Understand that water and fire, though mutually destructive, become husband and wife;
Recognize that metal and water, though mutually generative, reverse to become mother and child.
Thus, when the male embodies the female form, lead yields cinnabar;
When the female merges with the male shape, cinnabar births mercury.
The sun is yang, and within the sun dwells the crow—yang contains yin.
The moon is yin, and within the moon dwells the hare—yin contains yang.
These are the true images manifest by heaven and earth; those who comprehend them may be called true yin and yang.
There is also the Dao of yin and yang’s inversion, the principle of water and fire’s mutual necessity, and the path of creation and generation.
Once the path is known, one must grasp its root—
The root is the primordial root of heaven and earth.
Having obtained the root, one must grasp its image—
The image is that of yin and yang’s division.
Having obtained the image, one must follow movement and stillness.
Having followed movement and stillness, one must know its numbers.
Having known its numbers, one must adhere to the clepsydra.
Having adhered to the clepsydra, one must clarify advance and retreat.
Having clarified advance and retreat, one must distinguish dragon and tiger.
Having distinguished dragon and tiger, the boundaries of south and north are set,
The forms of metal and wood unite,
And the Dao of the Great Elixir is accomplished.

There are further inner and outer symbolic methods, inner and outer water and fire;
There are altars and furnaces, crucibles and chambers;
There are embryos and wombs, line images and hexagrams;
There are the fire times of water and fire, the rules of extraction and addition;
There are the molds of casting and pouring, the forms of separation and union—
All these must be fully prepared; none may be lacking.
The aspirant must further cast aside sensory pleasures, abandon cravings,
Renounce fame and profit, retreat to sacred mountains,
Sever mundane ties, befriend immortals,
And cultivate in seclusion, ceaselessly day and night—
Only then may success be hoped for.
Without such dedication, one’s efforts will be in vain.
Thus, the Perfected Lord of Yin states: "Do not shrink from gains and losses; with single-minded devotion, refine the Reverted Elixir—only then may one harbor such hopes."

In the tenth year of the Guangzheng reign of the Later Shu (947), in the cyclical year *dingwei*, on the eighth day of the ninth month, Peng Xiao of Feihe Mountain, the True One of Unity, composed this preface.

**The *Cantong Qi*’s "Song of the Crucible" and the *Illuminating Mirror Diagrams* conclude here.**

[Annotations and textual variants from the original are not translated as they are editorial notes rather than part of the main text.]

---

The crucible’s body, in its entirety,
Cycles through ten-day intervals—fire talismans align.
When the moment arrives, the flame refines,
For those who grasp the art, the Way unfolds.

Yet if one’s nature is not attuned,
Or the mind’s threads entangled,
How can the golden elder and mercury unite in gestation?
North and south, lead and gold—ancestral roots of yang and yin—
Must converge in fire, their essences compressed,
Their spirits poured forth, their hopes fulfilled.
