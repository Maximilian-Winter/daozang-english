**Preface to the *Collected Works of Master Zongxuan***
*Composed by Quan Deyu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites of the Tang*

The Dao, as a thing, originates from nothing yet pervades all. How much more so when rooted in profound insight and expressed in ultimate speech? Such words, resonant with the Dao, are like the three luminaries adorning the heavens or the hundred grasses flourishing upon the earth—level and expansive, serene and pure, drifting beyond the eight bounds to traverse the three ages, companions to the Creator. Those who fall short adorn their words with ornament but sink into mud when engaging principle; though their eloquence may be admirable, those who seek the true essence do not align with them.

Master Zongxuan, surnamed Wu, was one who truly understood speech. His given name was Jun, and his courtesy name, Zhenjie. A native of Huayin, at fifteen he devoted himself to the Dao, retiring with fellow practitioners to Yidi Mountain in Nanyang. There, he broadly studied the ancients, roamed beyond the mundane, cultivating amidst clouds and mushrooms, untouched by fame or profit. At the beginning of the Tianbao era, summoned by imperial edict to the capital, he was valued for his profound counsel, harmonizing with the sagely mysteries, and was permitted to become a Daoist priest. He dwelled on Songyang Hill, where he studied the Orthodox Unity teachings under Master Feng. Initially, Master Tao Hongjing of Liang had transmitted this Way to Master Wang Shengxuan, who passed it to Master Pan Tixuan, who in turn transmitted it to Master Feng. From Master Tao to Master Wu, five generations had thus succeeded one another, each employing hidden merit to aid beings and serving as teachers to rulers.

In the thirteenth year of Tianbao, he was summoned to the Datong Hall, and soon after, ordered to reside in the Hanlin Academy. As Emperor Ming ruled with lenience, the realm turned toward the Dao like grass bending in the wind. Wu presented his *Three Treatises on the Mysterious Principle*, which the emperor graciously accepted. Yet his aspiration lay in transcendence; repeatedly, he petitioned to return, likening himself to birds and fish, delighting in marshes and wilds. His request granted, before long bandits defiled the Three Rivers. Clad in feathered robes, he drifted downstream like an empty boat, dwelling on Mount Lu, ascending Mount Kuaiji, floating upon the Luo River, and resting at Tianzhu Peak. Concealing his brilliance, he followed the inclinations of his spirit-turtle. At times, he gave voice to the Dao, harmonizing with celestial principle. Like Yuan Gong chanting amidst purple mushrooms or Tao Hongjing rejoicing in white clouds, his compositions excelled in metaphor and allusion. In his *Poem on Governance Through the Ages*, *Ode to the Great Elegance*, *Hymns of Pacing the Void*, and miscellaneous verses on roaming immortals, he either contemplated antiquity to lament the world’s decline or surveyed the myriad phenomena to fathom the pivot of the cosmos. He examined the threads of life and destiny, grasped the vicissitudes of human affairs, and fundamentally advocated conserving spirit and tempering sharpness. His extraordinary imagery and transcendent tones resound like jade striking clouds or the inverted shadows of mountains, with the immortals Peng and Wang, Song and Qiao vividly before the eye. Among recent wanderers beyond the world who mastered the six principles of poetry, Master Wu was their leader.

As for his comprehensive discourse on the wonders of the Valley Spirit, there is the *Mysterious Principle*. On the distance between the thorny heart and the Dao, there is the *Treatise on the Attainability of Immortality*. To cleanse and purify, preventing the Dao from slipping away, there are the *Rhapsody on Washing the Heart* and *Rhapsody on Dwelling in the Mountains*. To cultivate sincerity within and rest the celestial sovereign, there are the *Treatise on Heart and Eye* and *Ode to the Harmony of Form and Spirit*. His other compositions—letters, eulogies, farewells—spoke only of the Dao, and what he spoke was practicable. Subtle yet wondrous, towering and luminous, they total four hundred fifty pieces. The vast and profound words of the Perfected are all contained herein.

In the thirteenth year of the Dali era, in the year of the Quail’s Head, he resided at a Daoist abbey in Xuancheng, where he burned incense and returned to the Void within his chamber. His disciple Shao Jixuan led his followers to pacify their spirits at the western foot of Tianzhu Peak, following their master’s command. Jixuan had deeply grasped the Master’s Dao, embodying stillness like withered wood or stagnant water, excising the heart and relinquishing form. Wang Yan of Taiyuan once admired the Master’s virtue. Twenty-five years after the Master’s transformation, Yan, then serving as Imperial Censor, compiled these posthumous writings into thirty fascicles, presenting them to the throne with a memorial. They were stored in the imperial archives. Later, Jixuan obtained a copy and entrusted it to me, requesting a preface to ensure its enduring transmission. Other discourses clarifying worldly delusions are not included in this compilation. As for accounts of extraordinary feats, tales of strange phenomena, records of transcendence sites, and talismans for harmonizing gaze and elixir, these are all inscribed upon metal and stone. Here, I have merely gathered these writings to outline their essence, that future learners of the Dao may know that those who understand the Dao must also understand its words.

**Collected Works of Master Zongxuan, Fascicle One**

**Rhapsody on Dwelling in the Mountains**

Moved by the sagely teachings of the Mysterious Ones, I realized my kin were distant in name alone. Words could be abandoned for silence, and the body should remain coiled, not unfurled. Like the quail nesting in the forest, content with a single branch, my nature, delighted, could not be denied. Thus, I entrusted myself to these mountains to build my hut. Here, I find joy in lingering, dwelling in the numinous ruins of carefree wandering.

Behold the winding ridges, the towering valleys, the surging springs, the clustered forests. Behind, peaks coil in grandeur; before, crags rise and fall in disarray. In shadowed ravines, summer’s frost lingers; on sunlit cliffs, winter’s warmth abides. I admire the steadfast integrity of pines and bamboos, the secluded fragrance of orchids and chrysanthemums. The hollow wind clears my ears; idle clouds brighten my eyes. I rely on the crane’s cry to mark the night and the gull’s flight to know dawn. My thoughts are stilled by absence of disturbance; my spirit is tranquil in few desires.

Thus, I chant the *Kaopan* of the poets and recite the *Taiyi*’s praises. Far from the treacherous paths of the vulgar world, I dissolve the harm of praise and blame. Treading the level road beyond the mundane, I am assured of escaping anxiety and fear.

Having withdrawn into shade to rest my form, I vanish my traces through inaction. Though this seems a trivial matter in the mundane realm, it is in truth the enduring strategy beyond the world. What others discard, I gather—thus dwelling in simplicity, I remain ever content. Gazing into the unseen to withdraw my sight, listening to silence to return to stillness. Harmony is not confined to fine wine, nor joy dependent on strings and zither. I burn pure incense to refine my *qi*, open jade tablets to dispel ignorance. I aspire to cast off stagnation in luminous vastness, perhaps to draw near the true through resonance. I discern the forms within the Great Void, perceive the wondrous workings that are not empty.

Morning audiences with Heaven are brief; gathering herbs leaves ample leisure. Though the body still relies on exhalation and inhalation, the mind has already shed all nearness. I know the Dao is free of rise and fall, while things undergo existence and decay. Thus, embracing the root of life, I live eternally; embodying the origin of transformation, I remain unchanging.

Desolate and dust-free—who is my neighbor? My steps grow distant, and friends ever more remote; my schemes forgotten, even birds and beasts may be tamed. My bearing disdains the clamor of the age; my heart ever abides with the ancients. I look up to the boundless, carefree paths of Chao and You, chant the silent, pure transformations of Fuxi and Shennong. I study the profound mysteries of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, befriend the true Dao of Master Redpine and Wang Qiao. Though I briefly lack the merit to benefit others, I truly perfect myself alone. Grateful for the joy of self-attainment, I dare to conceal my essence in reclusion.

**Rhapsody on Bamboo**

When Earth’s spirit scatters life, how majestic is the profusion of all things! Behold this bamboo, towering and upright, drawing from the pure source of creation. It harmonizes with the Dao and embraces emptiness, manifesting integrity and displaying constancy. Its leaves spread in lush, jade-like clusters; its stalks stand fresh and gleaming, like polished nephrite.

When the harmonious wind flows freely, all things flourish in display: blossoms bloom in dense groves, elms and willows thrive by thoroughfares. Yet bamboo does not rely on lush fragrance to shine, but endures year after year with its verdant stalks—nothing extraordinary in this. But when killing winds sharpen their edge and freezing frost soughs, gazing across the plain, the forests seem lost. Bamboo endures the frozen desolation, growing ever denser in its emerald splendor. In this, it is truly worthy of esteem.

Thus, the *Book of Songs* praises its "thick growth," and the *Book of Documents* records its tribute. How splendid the bamboo groves of Qiyuan, how fine those of Yunmeng! Long ago, the Divine Farmer established the offices of Yin and Yang. He sent Ling Lun to Xie Valley to fell the precious tall bamboo, carving it into the six pitch-pipes to harmonize *qi*, tuning the eight winds to accord with the constant. Then, fashioning flutes and panpipes to complete the music, their sound overflowed and grew ever more enduring. When the sheng and yu pipes sounded, even birds and beasts followed in their tracks.

Truly, its natural purity—how could the common forests compare? Consider the thousand acres by the Wei River, the numerous groves of Shanyang. Those of Huiji rival green jade in their luster; those of Luofu match gold in their hue. Above, they veil the sky in silent clouds; below, they murmur with the wind’s song. They block the scorching brilliance of the sun, admit the chilling shade of winter’s yin. Here, the Prince of Liang composed his whistling verses; here, Ji Kang sought his secluded wanderings. Summoning fine guests and worthy friends, they savored sweet wine and played the zither. How delightful the carefree pleasures of their roaming, how pure the distant thoughts of their tranquil hearts!

Then there are those that flank the blue river, lean against crimson cliffs, harboring the deep, deep mists of water, swaying with the vast, hazy vapors of the crags. The Xiang Consorts wept in sorrow, inspiring the *Chu Songs* to lament dew-drenched partings. Some stand tall like the towering blasts of war drums, others loom like the sheer gates of heaven. All are the gathering places of phoenixes and simurghs, the roosting grounds of kingfishers and halcyons. Not only do they grace the vast wilderness, but they also gleam upon the peaks of Penglai.

Their fruits are pearl-like grains; their flowers, purple and silken. They scatter white powder like flying snow, their iron-hard stems resonating like bells. Truly, they are the steeds of the immortals—beyond the reach of mortal men. Yet some have transformed into pheasants in Wu, become dragons in Ge Marsh; some nurture the *guan* insects, rear the *tao* twigs. A single shoot reveals its lineage; three nodes bring forth an infant’s fortune. Their flourishing branches inspire filial devotion; their lush canopies display marvels. They guard tombs and altars, reducing dust; encircle stones, casting ever-growing shade. All are wondrous transformations, strange and elusive—truly difficult to know in full.

Among the myriad kinds, there are those with leaves like thistles and reeds, stems striped like smoke or speckled like bamboo shoots; some stand solemn like *gu* stalks or *xiang* boxes, others spread like mica’s branches. Some *da* arrows float in ethereal hues, their *miao* and *sheng* stalks pure in pattern, embroidered in texture. The local gazetteers omit their records; the *Classic of Mountains* leaves them unchronicled—how could one detail them all?

None fail to be firm in nature, vibrant in color. Unshaped, they are round; unbent, they are straight. Thus, the High Ancestor crafted crowns to honor rank; Emperor Xiaowen split tallies to mark office. The Marquis of Bowang conveyed them beyond the Great Xia; the Son of Heaven Mu planted them by the Dark Pool’s side. Extending this pattern ever further—how could this rhapsody exhaust it?

**Rhapsody of the Recluse**

The True Recluse Master embodies vastness and stillness, his spirit clear and qi harmonious. He stands far beyond the dust of the world, deeply contemplating the origin of transformation. Reposing in the chamber of Great Harmony, he chants the winds of ancient mystery, treasuring what others discard and forsaking what others esteem. For him, the Dao and virtue are his groves and gardens, wherein he roams forever free.

There was a worldly nobleman who, stirred to dispel his ignorance, sought the Master’s abode and inquired about the divergence between withdrawal and engagement. Bowing deeply, he knelt and spoke:

“I have heard that when a scholar is born, he perfects a hundred virtues and honors the nine powers. In stillness, he becomes the model for all things; in action, the standard for all people. Thus, if he is visible, he does not hide; if he has words, he does not remain silent. He enables the rulers above to emulate the governance of Yao and Shun, and the people below to dwell in the realm of benevolence and longevity. Only when the Two Modes harmonize and the Nine Provinces unite does he divide the land among men and wield the jade tablet of office.

Thus, Yi Yin left the cauldrons of Youshen, and the Grand Duke abandoned his fishing to emerge from the byways. By morning, they trod the mire of the court; by evening, they ascended the vermilion steps—like towering trees gathering phoenixes, or clear ice leaping with egrets. Why must one feign aloofness and yearn for seclusion, disrupting the balance of harmony? Why follow the footsteps of Chao and Xu, or trace the path of Bo Yi and Shu Qi? They starved their flesh and bones, brought discord to the fields and hamlets, abandoned the broad and cultivated thoroughfares to tread the desolate and overgrown paths. They rinsed their mouths with the cold, ringing springs and rested on the lush green grass. They lamented the evening rustling of the forest wind and wearied of the morning cries of mountain birds. At first, they languished in hunger and exhaustion; in the end, they nested in cold like coiled phoenixes. Truly, the alternation of action and withdrawal is evident, and only reputation and reality can be examined. I wish to hear your ultimate words, that I may face the right direction without confusion.”

The Master’s countenance merged with the boundless heavens, his heart congealed with the Primordial Ancestor. He erased the boundary between fortune and misfortune, severed the leverage of pivotal power. Though he would have preferred silence, he could not but respond:

“In the age of primordial chaos, things knew no hardship or obstruction. Above, the heights were like towering mounds; below, the depths resembled level plains. High and low held their fixed positions, each flourishing in its place. The worthy and the foolish shared the same branch; wisdom and deceit had no occasion to arise. Who was withdrawn? Who was engaged? Who was silent? Who spoke?

But when the times shifted and simplicity scattered, substance changed and purity corrupted, ascent and descent diverged, brightness and darkness parted ways. The firm and the yielding clashed; the crooked and the straight rubbed against one another. Some swallowed the bait and took the hook; others flew recklessly and struck the net. The august kings, pitying the customs of the age, sought to rescue the drowning from the vast waves. Thus, they began with yielding and deference, only to end in shields and spears. Though the policies and teachings differed, the laws and commands multiplied. Seeking to curb disorder and restore order was like trying to still the branches by beckoning the wind. They adorned rites to solicit reverence and refined music to guide harmony. Though the sages toiled tirelessly, in the end, they could only watch as all collapsed.

Thereupon, above arose profligate rulers, and below appeared loyal ministers. The ranks of Longfeng and the kind of Chang Hong, though they followed righteousness to establish their names, ultimately defied heaven and lost their lives. They only succeeded in amplifying the infamy of benighted rulers and exhausting the benevolent blessings for the people. Thus, the fully virtuous scholars concealed their brilliance and preserved their authenticity. Perceiving that the course of history lies in destiny and that survival or ruin does not depend on men, they sought to support the endangered and uphold the falling—like a single hair lifting a thousand *jun*, or a clod of earth damming a great river. Therefore, they guarded the primal auspiciousness of fine reclusion and followed the hidden obscurity of the Lesser Florescence.

Thus, Hong Ya and Guang Cheng initiated the tradition, while Zi Zhou and Shan Juan carried it forward. The Fen River witnessed the true pride of the Emperor; the Yingyang heard of the old man who washed his ears. They regarded great fame as dregs and the greatest treasure as dust and grime. Their hearts were untroubled by gain or loss, their minds at ease in the forests and marshes. Without splitting their hearts, they had no desires; without exhaling and inhaling, they attained long life. They deemed the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers mere ditches and furrows, and Mounts Song and Tai mere mounds and hillocks. Thus, the Son of Heaven could not make them his ministers, nor could the feudal lords befriend them. Was this because the path was uniquely arduous? Truly, it has endured through the ages. None failed to have their Dao penetrate past and present, their traces unbound by odd or even. They steadied the falsity and thinness of the latter age, causing those who turned toward the wind to return to depth.

Consider Ziguo’s counsel to Yu of Xia, Zangsou’s instruction to Wen of Zhou, Zhonglian’s repulsion of the Qin army, and Ganmu’s protection of the Wei lord. Xian Gao’s subtle demeanor achieved merit; the Four Elders’ ease established their accomplishment. At first, they blended with the world to display their usefulness, but in the end, they soared beyond the crowd. Having elevated their aspirations to the azure clouds, they ultimately nested their bodies in the white mist. These were those who were unobstructed by the myriad things and who, when the time came, soothed the customs to resolve strife.

As for those who regarded yielding as weighty as Mount Tai and saw wealth and honor as light as goose down—such were the sons of Guzhu and the elder brother of King Ji. They relished eating ferns beneath Mount Shouyang and delighted in gathering herbs along the ridges of Kunwu. Zhuangzi returned to his home and expounded the Dao; Guan Yin resigned his post and perfected his authenticity. The Gatekeeper of Chen concealed his name in holding the gate; Ju and Nie avoided the world to plow side by side. The man of Hanyin held his urn and forgot his schemes; the Fisherman rode the current to wash his cap-strings. Yu Liang irrigated his garden to escape the minister’s office; the man of Lai carried his load to decline the minister’s rank. Zhuangzi of Nanhua lodged his traces in the Painted Garden; Liezi of Zheng wandered the fields to silence his fame. The madman of Chu concealed himself in obscurity; Yan of Shu plunged into darkness. The Chancellor deferred to Master Gai; the Commandant of Justice tethered his horse to Wang Sheng. Thus, Emperors Wen and Jing followed the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and the state grew wealthy while punishments were clear. Ji Zhu divined to instruct the customs; Wen Tong litigated over fields to sully his name. Yan He dug through his wall to avoid recruitment; Bo Xiu hid to escape glory. Pang Gong instructed his wife in weeding and hoeing; Yan Guang brushed his robes in the imperial court. Qi Qi expressed his intent through the Three Joys; Liang Hong gave voice to his feelings with the Five Sighs. Shang Ziping upheld his principles, completing his marriage before departing forever. Xu Shuxuan maintained his integrity, leaving his spouse to journey afar. They listened to the eternal whistling on Su Gate, like the harmonious cries of phoenixes.”

Beholding Xia Tong’s long song, one admires the soaring clouds and drifting snow.

As for Jiao Xian of Qujing, Guo Wen, and Dong Jing—
their celestial mechanism aligned with the Great Simplicity,
their profound silence met with the true essence.
In utter seclusion, there were Zizhen and Zhongwei;
in unshakable resolve, Tai Zhong and Guan Ning.
Some found delight in zither and books,
others dwelt in serene indifference, free from worldly pursuits.
These men shared the same form but differed in spirit.
Embracing unchanging purity,
forsaking the solitary integrity of nature,
they drew joy from the Dao in leisurely freedom,
their endeavors untroubled by hardship or peace.
They understood that the essence of things lies in simplicity,
and knew the Way of Heaven abhors fullness.
Like the wild swan soaring in boundless skies,
how could the fowler’s snare ever entangle it?
Thus, glory and rank could not become their burden,
regret and shame could never sway them.

In their hidden virtue and subtle merit,
mysterious deeds quietly unfolded.
They grieved not at slander,
nor rejoiced in praise.
By non-action, they perfected their nature;
by non-affair, they calmed their thoughts.
They perceived the imperceptible,
grasped the indistinct,
made friends with the murmuring pines,
and suddenly rode the light to take flight.
Such is the Dao of reclusion—
who can fathom the dwelling of the Land of Nothingness?

Therefore, those who enter the court seldom depart,
while the dwellers of mountains and forests rightly go and never return.
If one seeks fame in ostentatious display,
leaves traces on green hills,
hopes to pay tribute at the valley’s mouth,
or craves silk gifts at the cloud-gate,
this is not the nourishment of integrity by cliffs and springs,
but the concealment of treachery in royal mounds and ravines.
In this decadent age of vulgarity,
how can the pure streams be scaled?

Some may exploit this path to gain fortune,
but they will never escape lifelong shame.
For the seeds of fortune often harbor the roots of disaster,
and prayers for prosperity may weave the threads of decline.
Thus, Lü Buwei recognized a rare commodity
and secretly offered his pregnant wife with cunning words.
Lord Lü discerned the dragon’s countenance
and schemed to wed his daughter for eternal honor.
His plans succeeded, and affairs prospered,
clearing the path to soar to the heavens.
Yet sudden calamity arose, and misfortune took shape,
drawing repeated punishments to his gate.

The Huo clan aided three emperors,
believing the legacies of Yi and Zhou had returned.
How resplendent they were in their time—
yet swiftly were their descendants annihilated.
Witnessing the patterns of rise and fall,
one sees different eras sharing the same source.
The overturned cart ahead serves as a warning,
yet the rear axle follows to its ruin.
Qin wantonly unleashed its venom in burying scholars,
Han spread the injustice of the Party Proscriptions.
Though the many gentlemen sought to cultivate fame and distinction,
they only bequeathed sorrow to their buried souls.
Gazing at the boundless heavens,
who could harmonize with the imperial will?

Truly, auspicious winds cling to humble thatch,
while the breath of the desert assails the vermilion halls.
I shall befriend the boundless,
take the Mysterious Origin as my teacher,
reject life and death,
unite with heaven and earth.
This will cure the illness of deep sorrow,
and thus I hold fast to this Dao ever more firmly.

When the Master finished speaking,
the young lord bowed his head in gratitude:
“This humble one has long been mired in shallow, common discourse.
Fortunate to bathe in the profound subtleties of your teaching,
it may be called the cleansing of lingering dregs,
the parting of thick darkness.
I wish to purify my body and spirit,
to wander as a mere follower in your footsteps.”

**Ode on Longing for the Return to Pristine Simplicity**

When the mystic wind of Great Simplicity first arose,
it lingered faintly through the ages of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor.
Though raw simplicity scattered to form the myriad things,
traces of it yet endured into the reigns of Yao and Shun.
As the transformative power of purity waned day by day,
by the time of Yin and Zhou, it had nearly vanished.

Only Confucius, born with exceptional insight,
gazed upon the decadence and was moved to sorrow.
He compiled the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*,
instituted rites and music to stem the collapse,
and sought to turn the latecomers’ chariot back toward the source.

Then the Mysterious Origin crossed the flowing sands,
leaving the *Dao* and *Virtue* with Guan Yin—
truly concise in form, profound in meaning—
to guide the frivolously competitive back to their root.
Yet the great turning of fate’s wheel cannot be stayed;
even the sage cannot prop up what is doomed to fall.

After the Five Hegemons perished and the Seven States clashed,
the tyrannical Qin arose, crushing the Ru and suppressing the Dao.
When the august Han brought order,
the people embraced harmony and brightness.
Emperor Wen ruled with effortless governance,
nearly setting aside punishments and laws,
while joyful hearts upheld their inherent nature.
Emperor Wu favored campaigns of conquest,
yet also revered classical rites.
Though perfect virtue was not fully realized,
culture and refinement flourished.

Under Emperors Yuan and Cheng, weak and ineffectual,
governance and teaching declined.
The people’s respite came only with the middle revival of Emperor Guangwu.
Why did Emperor Ming, lacking virtue,
succumb to the delusions of demonic dreams?
He erected shrines to foreign deities,
following the illusions of the indistinct and vague.
What began as a trickle swelled into a vast, overflowing current.
Though still faint through the Three Kingdoms,
it surged mightily under the Five Barbarians.
The rites of Hua and Xia were abandoned,
while the customs of the frontier wilds spread.
The desert’s baleful *qi* arose in rebellion,
and human hearts shifted with a sudden, chilling change.

Thus they mocked their lords and kin,
scorned enduring norms,
shaved the heads of the noble,
and crowned the lowly with arrogance.
They exhausted their thoughts in pursuit of blessings,
yet trembled with doubt and fear of retribution.
From the highest, who rose from the ranks of marquises and kings,
to the lowest, who received no reward for merit,
they revered the golden effigies of Zoroaster,
and arrayed towering purple halls in their honor.
The bamboo of a thousand acres would not suffice
to record their absurd and fanciful tales;
the wealth of nine treasuries could not meet
the demands of their boundless vows.

Then arose jeweled trees and jade pavilions,
piercing the clouds and outshining the sun,
with resonant bells echoing in deep chambers—
a spectacle beyond full description.
Surpassing the grandeur of Zhanghua Palace,
they filled the realm in dense array,
unmatched since the dawn of time.

They held the corrupted leaves of foreign scriptures in high esteem,
while despising the classics of the former kings.
They venerated cruel punishments and base men,
feasting in vast halls and refined chambers.
Thus the humble homes toiled without end,
while the black-robed gates enjoyed perpetual ease.
From state to household,
they sought the empty and squandered the real.
Those who revered and obeyed were granted auspicious omens,
while those who resisted or opposed were deceived with accusations of sin and sickness.

Thus did those of middling intelligence and below aid in perfecting their arts of deceit and excess. This may be called the concealment of the utmost truth and the emergence of the greatest falsehood. Here, the wicked and heretical factions gathered and rested, amassing wealth without tilling, clothing themselves without weaving. They lured with gifts and seized with greed, swallowing like whales and devouring like silkworms. As jiao and li lurk in water, so did jackals and leopards cling to wings. None failed to feign small kindnesses to mask their outward mercy, while harboring deep malice and inner treachery. This was not merely the scourge of an age, but the bane of ten thousand generations—sufficient to embolden the base to arrogance and contempt, and to grieve the noble into silent sorrow.

Alas! Is this the work of Heaven’s Dao, or of human affairs? Heaven’s Dao is distant and hard to fathom, but human affairs are near and may be examined in detail. Though the root may lie in Heaven’s decree, the manifestation of evil is made plain by man. Such was the fate of the two Jie of the Zhong and Liu clans, and the two Qiang of the Fu and Yao houses—relying on the cunning of Hu scriptures, they drew upon Han brushes to propagate their teachings. Dao’an debated in the lands of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, while Huiyuan refined them along the Jiang and Xiang. Tu Cheng wielded his arts to stir the masses, and Kumarajiva gathered disciples to expand their sway. Their traces left no record in the annals of Ban and Ma, yet their principles were but stolen from Laozi and Zhuangzi. In one stroke, they made the barbarian hinterlands the center of the realm, demoting the Central States to mere guest lands. Their aim was to devour the Ru and swallow the Dao, to suppress emperors and obscure kings, to seize the handle of true sovereignty, and to grasp the reins of primordial transformation.

From ancient times to the present, no corruption has matched this. They defied Heaven and ravaged all things, disrupting order and confounding norms. From the Jin and Song dynasties to the Qi and Liang, none who promoted them survived, while those who abolished them flourished. Yet they persisted in their flight, never to return, and in the end met ruin and peril—why? For like insects grown accustomed to bitterness, long habituated to filth, their attempts to aid governance only deepened the chaos. When fate reached its nadir, rulers awakened and ministers acted decisively; the myriad people, without consultation, shifted in silent accord, while gods and spirits responded in hidden assent. Mountains and rivers grew serene, sun and moon shone with renewed brilliance. Naturally, courtly thought turned to civil virtue, and the wilds yearned for upright governance. Like piled ice, so thick and solid, only the warmth of spring could melt and disperse it.

At such a time, the Supreme issued its decree, summoning the myriad spirits. The enforcers of kalpas were dispatched to purge wickedness, and the executors of law to administer justice. The Five Thearchs aligned their talismans, the Three Officials united in their summons. Heavenly generals were commanded to marshal the celestial soldiers, beat the heavenly drums, unfurl the heavenly banners, brandish the golden halberds, hurl the fire bells, dispatch the fiery warriors, unleash the swift thunderbolts, emerge into radiant vastness, and plunge into dark obscurity. They captured the shadowless, searched the soundless, seized the heresiarchs, annihilated the demonic hosts, rectified the celestial steps, swept away the perverse, eradicated lingering evil for a thousand years, and spread beneficent blessings to the eight directions. The armies descended to the earth, and merit was returned to the Supreme Clarity.

Thereafter, human relations could follow their natural course, and the divine Dao could endure in its purity. Perverse customs were transformed into harmonious virtue. Awaiting the restoration of pristine winds, I would then drum my belly and strike the earth upon the cliffs, chanting the odes of Wu Huang and Li Lian in the Great Courtyard.

*Rhapsody on Washing the Heart*

I once refined the Dao to cultivate myself, examining the paths trodden by sages of old. Drawing upon loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, I preserved my good name in life and death. The merits of Yi and Zhou reached the August Heaven, while the teachings of Confucius and Mo Di succored the living. Yet to begin with lofty ambition is easy; to end in tranquil accomplishment is hard. Only the exalted streams of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao transcended the world and endured in purity. Whether by innate endowment or through cultivation, such attainment is the fruit of discipline.

Why doubt and seek to exhaust the principle? Let me but approximate the legacy of the ancients. This is to ride the primal ancestors of the Great Simplicity, to embody the ultimate origin of emptiness and harmony. To emerge from the mechanisms of transformation, to depart from the movements of yin and yang. To know that what completes me is spirit, and what defines me is man. Spirit aligns with nature to unite with the Dao, while man responds to emotions and loses the true. Those who perceive this with clarity stand apart from the common herd. Thus they accumulate the subtle and manifest the luminous, riding the single qi to daily renewal.

Once, I was moved by the ancients and, in my prime, turned away from the vulgar. I cast aside the worldly chariot, galloping along the free paths beyond the mundane. I gathered what the age had discarded, despising what the world prized. I looked down upon the vast sea in its profound stillness, gazed up at the crimson skies in their towering majesty. While others indulged in rich flavors and fine adornments, I knew not what they found beautiful.

Thus I withdrew from the dusty world, dwelling among cloud-capped peaks. I purified my form and cleansed my heart. I hoped to witness the forms of the dark and distant, to hear the sounds of emptiness and silence. The perfected dwelled on high, bestowing their grace; the upright qi sought no distance in its pursuit. I mirrored the radiance of twin luminaries, soaring with the myriad spirits. I polished the divine light of the cinnabar palace, rinsed my mouth with the sacred fluid of the jade pool. I cultivated the Five Wefts to soar, traversed the Seven Origins in freedom. Yang’s essence gleamed and gathered, while yin’s dregs dissolved like melting ice. Form, through use, grew ever more harmonious; the heart, through preservation, turned ever more still. I savored the profound purport through the long day, chanting the sacred scriptures to delight myself.

Though the celestial path be distant and long, I hoped that through resonance it might yet be attained. Why did the rebellious barbarians disrupt order, assembling arms at Luoyang? Fearing the burning of their nests, they fled like crows to the riverside. Anxieties and alarms left no leisure for tranquil focus, and my Dao thus suffered a breach. The purity of emptiness and tranquility strayed from its course, overcome by the filth of clamor and chaos. Thus I drifted, forgetting to return, until nearly a decade had passed. I lamented the fleeting light, seeing my graying hair and feeling sorrow arise.

Alas! Advancement brings the difficulty of racing chariots up the hills; retreat holds the ease of turning the compass into the valley. Entangled in worldly affairs, I was submerged—all due to the influence of those near at hand. Pursuing what human feelings desire, I was surely abandoned by the divine Dao. Yet principle knows no path that does not return. I resolved to cast off my burdens. What is defiled can be washed clean, what is turbid can be clarified. Let the emotions of indolence be discarded, and the thoughts of diligence arise.

Replacing sweetness with purity, exchanging restlessness for tranquil solidity.
The embrace of a tree begins with a sprouting shoot; treading frost leads to solid ice.
Who says the subtle and imperceptible hold nothing? I know well that the indistinct and fleeting may be relied upon.

Thus I once more ascended the *Fu of Attaining the Real*, brushing my robes in the endless forest, following my long-held aspirations. Near at hand, I honored the scriptures of immortals; from afar, I received the teachings of true masters.
The mechanism forgotten, qi became upright; the inner struggle overcome, spirit reigned supreme.
May this Dao endure forever—I rejoice in the remedy of no falsehood.

The Creator knots emptiness into substance; the attainer of the Dao returns from abundance to essence.
Thus are heaven and earth’s vast distances aligned, the sun and moon’s brilliance invoked.
I mourn that the multitude sink and perish in succession, while I alone pursue longevity.
Awakening to the brevity of the world and the permanence of the Dao, I know fame is distant yet the body near.
Thus I forgot schemes and erased traces, refining my bones and purifying my spirit.

The Dao does not deceive me—resonance reaches even the formless.
Heaven must witness me—preserving and uniting my primordial truth.
Yin’s dregs fall away, and form transcends; yang’s numen is complete, and I ascend in feathered transformation.
Behold the nine immortals, radiant and majestic, descending with the eight luminaries to draw near.
How the rainbow banners ripple and sway—I shall prepare this celestial chariot.
Holding the reins of creation, I emerge beyond life and death.
Far from the dimness of the four wilds, near the radiance of the three luminaries.
Traversing the vast and boundless void, I perceive the cosmos as lowly and shallow.
Dragons and phoenixes refine me, ascending me to the Dark Capital.
Flowing jade tones in perfect stillness, scattering golden light in the Great Void.
Star officials follow behind; cloud generals lead the way.
Commanding the Eight Might and Six Spirits, I sweep away lingering malevolence from the celestial thoroughfares.
Brandishing my authority to subdue the hundred demons, I gather the myriad spirits for joyous wandering.
The ten absolutes swirl and surge, brushing the layered heavens with swift vigor.
Entering the nine gates of the serene palace, passing the Supreme Subtlety for a single rest.
Leaning on the Flowery Canopy to summon the perfected, ascending the Purple Court to pay homage to the Emperor.
He offers me the dew of harmony, delights me with the celestial melody.
To my left, I behold Yu Yi; to my right, I gaze upon Jie Lin.
Truly vast and boundless, solemn and majestic.
The feast resounds without end, the revelry unceasing.
Floating upon the broad currents of the Sky River, plucking the fragrant herbs of the *Qian* tree.
The numinous mist gathers at the eight thoroughfares; the jeweled clouds rise on all sides.
Singing once of this realm’s delight, my heart does not linger.
Raising the jade wheel to advance directly, I ascend gently and float upward.
Harnessing the three qi to soar high—what are ten thousand men to such heights?
I behold the Primal Beginning in the Jade Dawn, pay homage to the Void Sovereign in the Golden Portal.
True companions gather in countless ranks, all turning to me with joy.
Thus I condense into being, disperse into origin; seeing without scrutiny, hearing without acuity.
Vision extends to the boundless; hearing encompasses the infinite.
Movement does not rely on the heart; flight does not depend on wings.
With the eons, I endure; I regard ten thousand kalpas as a single breath.
Now ascending the brocade-adorned pavilion, now feasting in the round and radiant chamber.
Treading the clear vastness of the Great Desert, playing amidst the dazzling rosy clouds.
Gazing up at the towering Jade Ridge, looking down upon the surging Azure Ford.
The crimson trees stretch in misty rows; the divine winds chime like jade.
How endless is this supreme joy—eternal freedom becomes my constant state.

**Fu on Cloud-Liquid Spring, with Preface**

On the eastern ridge of my dwelling in Jun, halfway up the slope, there is a spring. Its flow is as slender as a finger, unchanging through winter and summer. The mountain has few rocks but abundant mica. The water is white in color, sweet and clear in taste. This is the essence of mica’s liquid—hence the name *Cloud-Liquid Spring*. I built a hut beside it, channeling the water beneath my studio’s eaves. Drinking and rinsing with it, I have never suffered thirst.

This summer, no rain fell until the tenth month. Rivers and lakes dwindled; wells and streams ran dry. Yet this spring flows cold and clear, undiminished from its usual state. Marveling at its constancy, I compose this *fu*.

Earth’s primal qi nurtures and flows, forming springs.
First among the five phases, it precedes all things.
Here, a hidden stream emerges from this mountainside.
Though nestled in obscurity, like an untapped well, it remains untouched.
I sought this numinous flow, climbing and parting the undergrowth.
I found its place secluded and pure, its source deep and enduring.
Frost and cold do not diminish it; summer rains do not swell it.
Thus I built a dwelling to drink here, finding joy in resting my head upon my arm.
It is the companion of dark jade’s essence, the very liquid of cloud’s radiance.
It cures illness, enhances life, filling and refreshing as one desires.
Suspended, it gleams pure white; dammed, it settles into deep blue.
By day, it shimmers with floating light; by night, it murmurs with gentle patter.

When yin and yang bring calamity, when drought and flood disrupt the seasons—
when scorching summer sees no rain, extending into the dark month—
the vast waves of rivers and lakes have long since dried;
even the bright waterfalls now cease.
The mighty Yangtze and lakes are humbled; how much more the humble streams and gullies?
Yet this spring holds fast to its nature, its slender flow undiminished.
Though distant lands receive no blessing, those nearby are nourished.
Those who once relied on it daily now find only fleeting trickles.
For sweet springs lack sources and easily run dry; cinnabar streams appear suddenly but are hard to grasp.
How much better to use this as a mirror, drawing from it as needed?

What of the elixirs of divine mountains, the nectars of the Emperor’s terrace—
welling in distant lands, pooling in uninhabited realms?
This spring, too, marks its wonder in this remote place, truly numinous and enduring.

**Fu on the Black Ape, with Preface**

Formerly, it was said that when King Mu of Zhou marched south, gentlemen transformed into apes and cranes, while petty men became insects and fish. For the spirit’s workings know no bounds—there is no change that does not occur.

Since entering Mount Lu, I have observed these black apes.
When rain darkens the sky, they are silent; when the sun clears, they let forth long calls.
They do not tread upon earth or stone, leaping freely among the trees.
In spring, they nibble blossoms; in autumn, they eat fruit.
They do not harm the crops, dwelling deep and far away.
Their hearts still hold the nature of gentlemen, unlike the cunning and deceitful among their kind.

Since the onset of manifold calamities, all creatures have withered and declined—deer and elk ensnared in nets, remnant fields exhausted by exactions. Yet these alone remain untouched, serene where no other thing finds rest. Is it not because they dwell in hidden, remote places, their lack of cunning sparing them from harm?

Once, Confucius sighed over the mountain hen on the ridge, saying, *"Timely! Timely!"* Moved by this, I have composed this rhapsody.

Here, in the layered peaks of the southern lands, the black apes are nurtured.
Never treading the earth, they dwell always among the trees.
Ever drifting without anchor, yet joyful and mindful.
When clouds and mist darken, they fall silent together; when wind and rain clear, they vie in song.
They stir the recluse’s thoughts to clarity, moisten the wanderer’s sleeves with tears.
Why must one listen to pipes in valleys or face the *yongmen* zither?
They traverse towering trees of a thousand fathoms, gaze down upon perilous cliffs of ten thousand spans.
They play in the chaos of drifting clouds, frolic in the slanting glow of the setting sun.
Joining arms to drink from the ravine, they summon companions in the misty twilight.
Some gather in tranquil repose, others scatter in distant pursuit.
One call echoes like the numinous crane; their nature aligns with the gentleman.
Barred by the peril of sheer cliffs, beyond the tread of tigers and leopards.
Sheltered in the dense intertwining of branches, beyond the sight of eagles and hawks.
Thus, when Feng Meng drew his bow, he halted in awe of their heights.
When Lord Deng snapped his arrow, he was moved by compassion.
Why fear that entanglements rarely befall them, when they do not exploit others for gain?
Unlike those who, like *juejue*, dig pits to lure men to slaughter, or apes who crave wine only to meet their doom.
The world treasures sable furs and white fox pelts,
yet those creatures, skilled in concealment, still fall prey to traps.
The musk deer, bearing fragrance, invites harm;
the cunning monkey, by its craft, draws arrows.
Small ones, like kingfishers, perish for their plumage;
great ones, like rhinos and elephants, are slaughtered for their hides.
Who can avoid the harm of what is useful and seek the benefit of what is not?
Thus, they abandon worldly concerns, forever carefree and at ease.
No authority or punishment looms over them; they cherish their kin.
Their food comes from nature, their clothing from their own bodies.
No taxes, no labor—no toil, no exertion.
As if the true teaching had never been imposed, they preserve their simple, nest-dwelling ways.
Beyond the reach of Yu’s governance, how could the Monkey Trainer ever tame them?

I have long known that man is the noblest of all creatures, yet how can one fathom the great equality of the primordial transformation?

**On the Attainability of Transcendence**

The *Hongfan* extols the five blessings, the first being longevity. To live to a hundred is deemed the greatest of heavenly favors—how much more so the boundless existence of transcendence? Yet long life and great fortune stand beyond all comparison. Why, then, do men of this age neglect and disdain it?

Let me attempt to explain:
Those of middling intelligence and below—common folk—are like birds and beasts, living and dying without awareness, laughing at the Way when they hear of it. Those above middling intelligence are constrained by the teachings of names and rites, bound by the trifles of the Three Bonds and Five Constants, with no leisure to hear the Way, their grasp of it tenuous at best. Only one in ten thousand can resolutely refine the body, resist the drowning of worldly passions, and devote themselves wholly to cultivation. Yet even among them, practice is secret, attainment hidden—thus, the methods remain rare in the world. How lamentable!

Long ago, Sangjiao asked Master Juan: *"Since ancient times, there has been death, yet you speak of transcendence—how can this be?"* Master Juan replied: *"Both exist."* By saying *"both exist,"* he meant that principle is never absent. If principle is never absent, then transcendence can be learned.

Ji Kang claimed: *"Transcendents are simply those who receive exceptional qi, endowed by nature—it cannot be attained through study."* This does not fully grasp the truth. Some attain it without cultivation, for they are endowed with exceptional qi. Others must study to succeed, their merit and practice fulfilled. Still others study but fail, their initial diligence lapsing, their sincerity unfulfilled. Each case has its own principle; one cannot generalize.

Man is born amid heaven and earth, distinct from all other creatures—this is clear. When moved, he responds; when stirred, he penetrates. Thus, when Geng Gong struck the cliff with his sword, springs gushed forth on the plain; when Li Guang loosed his arrow, it buried itself in stone. Such is the power of utmost sincerity—even earth and stone yield instantly, like an echo following sound. How much more so when the elixir’s sincerity is long established? Would the True Lord not act in secret on their behalf? If he does, the threshold of immortality is swiftly attained.

Who is the True Lord? The Supreme One—the ultimate origin of spirit and light, existing before the unseen, enthroned above the Purple Tenuity, mysteriously guiding all beings. The *Book of Songs* says: *"The Lord watches over you."* The *Book of Documents* states: *"Heaven’s gaze is keen and bright."* Rewarding good and punishing evil, it does not err by a hair’s breadth. Yet the deluded sons of nobles cannot fathom its source, using it daily yet unaware, turning their backs on the root to chase the branch.

There are seven ways one drifts far from the Way of transcendence, and seven ways one draws near to it. Men of this age, unable to glimpse the wondrous gate or penetrate the hidden path, echo one another in dismissing life as real and death as illusory. They cling to essence while discarding form, willingly entering the realm of death as if it were the natural order. Little do they know that heaven and earth are the essence of the *Book of Changes*—if heaven and earth perish, the *Changes* cannot be seen. Form and qi are the dwelling of essence; if form and qi decay, essence has no place to abide. If essence has no place to abide, what remains of me? This is the first way one drifts far from the Way.

Next, they claim transcendence must have limits, inevitably ending in ruin. Blinded by shallow wisdom, they fall into the net of delusion. How can they know that the solid arises from the formless? Qi accumulates from emptiness to generate spirit; spirit operates to conceive qi; qi congeals to gradually manifest; manifestation accumulates to form shape. When shape is established, spirit resides within—thus, man is born. If one follows its flow, death results; if one returns to its source, transcendence is achieved.

Thus, one summons the true to refine the form; when the form is purified, it merges with qi. One embraces the Dao to refine qi; when qi is purified, it merges with spirit. When the body and the Dao become one in darkness, this is called attaining the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally boundless—how can transcendence have limits?

Yet the world remains deeply deluded, never awakening—this is the second way one drifts far from the Way of transcendence.

Next, they stubbornly insist that existence and extinction are one, falsely claiming that prior knowledge is true awakening. They believe the body’s destiny is to decay and disperse, that the ethereal soul’s function is to be reborn, that having wearied of their present form, they scheme for a future one. How can they know that entering the great furnace of creation, subject to the forging of yin and yang, the wandering soul undergoes transformation, taking up residence in another vessel? The spirit joins a different lineage, the consciousness forgets its former form—like a crow turning into a fish, a fish into a crow, each following its own path, with no communication between them. Even the change of form escapes their understanding—how much less can they comprehend death and rebirth?

Truly pitiable, yet people do not pity themselves—this is the third way one drifts far from the Way of transcendence.

Those who take official rank as their greatest joy and fame as their path to immortality, delighting in beauty and sound, indulging in fine clothes and rich flavors—these believe they have secured a lasting strategy by establishing themselves and planning for distant posterity. How can they know that prosperity must decline, height must endanger, gain must be lost, and fullness must empty? Clinging to these as their firm foundation, they cast aside purity and emptiness, never willing to cultivate tranquility and wisdom in mutual nurturance, nor to follow their nature and commune with the real. This is the fourth way one drifts far from the Way of transcendence.

Next are those who, in their prime, are enslaved by love and desire, and in their gray-haired years, still cling to the hope of life. Though they may begin some cultivation, their wounds remain unhealed, their ingrained habits unbroken. They merely polish their outward appearance while secretly admiring the name of the Dao, yet stray from its true essence. Not removed from the register of death, not recorded in the ledger of the mysterious, time slips by, and the great end suddenly arrives. Only when about to perish do they resent and blame the spirits. This is the fifth way one drifts far from the Way of transcendence.

Next are those who hear that the great elixir can grant transcendence and that medicinal herbs can prolong life. They rush eagerly to the furnace and diligently to plants and minerals, their wealth exhausted by the eight minerals, their medicines ineffective at the three barriers. They do not know that the golden liquid awaits the transmission of the sacred formula from a perfected person, and that the magic mushrooms flourish only through the Dao’s qi. Failing to investigate the root, they busy themselves with the branches, achieving nothing in the end, and then claim the ancients deceived them. This is the sixth way one drifts far from the Way of transcendence.

Next are those who dwell among the Daoist clergy in body but drown in worldly realms in mind. Their actions violate precepts and prohibitions, and in stillness, they neglect cultivation. Outwardly, they win a reputation for purity and quietude, while inwardly, they harbor deceitful schemes. They may deceive people, but they cannot deceive the spirits. This is the seventh way one drifts far from the Way of transcendence.

Now, those whose nature delights in the mysterious and empty, whose passions are few and desires scant—who do not recognize the value of glory and splendor, nor force themselves to feign superiority; who do not see the allure of excess and perversion, nor rely on restraint to maintain chastity—embody perfect benevolence and contain perfect stillness. They transcend the traces of the mundane, dwelling in the realm beyond things, their thoughts bound to the Dao, taking non-action as their affair. This is the first way one draws near to the Way of transcendence.

Next are those who aspire to lofty ideals and revere antiquity, dedicating themselves to noble conduct. Knowing that glory and splendor are fleeting, they disregard them; knowing that sound and beauty can harm the nature, they renounce them. They cut away harmful influences, cultivate hidden virtue, restrain anger and suppress desire, equalize praise and blame, dwell in forests and mountains, and cultivate purity and truth. This is the second way one draws near to the Way of transcendence.

Next are those who, though dwelling in the arena of rank and salary, wander in mind through the realm of the Dao and virtue. They serve their superiors with loyalty and face their subordinates with righteousness, sparing of themselves but generous to others, benevolent, compassionate, reverent, and harmonious, broadly bestowing love. Outwardly, they mingle with the clamor and filth, while inwardly, they contain clarity and stillness. Secretly, they cultivate and refine themselves, loving life and hating death. This is the third way one draws near to the Way of transcendence.

Next are those who move freely through noble gates yet delight in poverty and willingly embrace lowliness. They possess the talent for governance yet float as if without it; they penetrate the learning of past and present yet remain open as if empty. They refuse titles and decline salaries, firmly esteeming the world beyond as their highest aspiration, calmly taking the preservation of life as their duty. This is the fourth way one draws near to the Way of transcendence.

Next are those endowed with brilliant and outstanding qualities, bearing noble and exceptional integrity. They advance with a mind free of scheming, facing the sharp and cunning as their adversaries, invincible in their assaults, victorious in a single battle. Then, they settle in stillness to secure their bodies, harmonize to preserve their spirits, and refine their essence to attain the real. This is the fifth way one draws near to the Way of transcendence.

Next are those who repent their past misdeeds and wash their hearts anew. Though they may have lost their way in youth, they hope to reclaim it in later years. They use merit to compensate for faults, so that faults fall away and merit remains whole; they replace wrong with right, so that wrong is forgotten and right endures. No hardship can shake their resolve, no clamor can disturb their nature. Only through utmost sincerity and subtlety do they gradually manifest their integrity. This is the sixth way one draws near to the Way of transcendence.

Next are those of perfect loyalty, perfect filial piety, perfect integrity, and perfect incorruptibility. Following the words of the *Zhen’gao*, they attain realization without cultivation. Like Bi Gan, whose heart was cut out yet did not die, or Hui Feng, who drowned yet lived again; like Boyi and Shuqi, or Zeng Shen and Xiaoji—though people saw them perish, the Dao preserved them. Such as these all enter the ranks of immortals, called "hidden radiance and latent transformation," dead yet not gone. This is the natural example. This is the seventh way one draws near to the Way of transcendence.

Reject those seven paths of distance and embrace these seven paths of nearness—this is called "rescuing from the pit, emerging from the mire, shattering the chariot of misfortune, and ascending the carriage of blessing." Only then may one begin to cross the ford of immortality. Thereupon, one recognizes where the original mandate resides, understands the source of the true qi, empties and calms the nature to nurture it, exhales the old and inhales the new to harmonize the spirit. Secure and stable in the heights, refined medicines assist and restore, so that inner and outer are both perfected, body and spirit both transcend. Though one may not yet ascend, I would surely say they are already flapping their wings above the cinnabar clouds.

The Dao is non-action and formless, yet responsive and faithful. Thus it is said: if people think of the Dao, the Dao also thinks of them; the Dao does not fail people, but people fail the Dao. Profound indeed are these words!

Worldly sentiments regard the Dao’s essence as mysterious and empty, thus valuing nothingness and despising being. People rely on their material endowments, thus grasping being and neglecting nothingness. How can they know that being arises from nothingness, and nothingness is illuminated through being? Only when being and nothingness merge as one is perfection attained. Thus, the vast emptiness and profound stillness are the formless image of the great Dao; the Two Modes and Three Luminaries are the formed image of the great Dao. If one merely takes extreme emptiness as the ultimate subtlety, how could one speak of exhaling and inhaling the primordial qi, circulating yin and yang, generating heaven and earth, and revolving the sun and moon? Therefore, being serves as the function of nothingness, and nothingness serves as the resource of being. Thus, the covering and bearing endure forever, and true sages never perish. For life is the great virtue of heaven and earth. Therefore, we see the vastness of the cosmos and the abundance of the myriad things—all exist for us. If they were to scatter like smoke or crumble like ash, how would they differ from heaven collapsing and earth sinking? Such transient brightness is not ours to possess. Thus it is said: death is the bitter suffering of heaven and humanity.

Who can dispel that bitter suffering? Cast off worldly dust, withdraw from the mundane, and dwell alone in the Dao’s embrace—how distant is the Dao? It shall soon be attained.

The utmost emptiness is profoundly subtle, awaiting resonance to reveal its numinosity, just as metal and stone contain sound, awaiting the strike to ring forth. Thus, when the square inch of the heart is opened to embrace emptiness, emptiness brings stillness; when stillness is relied upon to accumulate resonance, resonance brings communion. In communion, the cosmos settles into great peace, the radiance of heaven shines forth, and form and nature mutually sustain one another without end.

Moreover, the human form is modeled upon heaven and earth. The five viscera and six bowels, the hundred joints and four limbs—all are abodes of spirit and brightness, each with its own governance. Preserve them, and they endure; abandon them, and they vanish. Endurance brings life; vanishing brings death. Therefore, cast off death and seize life.

If one recites the Golden Scriptures of the Supreme Thearch, studies the Jade Chapters of Cavernous Perfection, gathers the Primordial Unity in the Crimson Palace, arrays the Three Origins in the Purple Chamber, inhales the radiant essence of the Two Luminaries, and ascends the numinous network of the Seven Origins—when the Dao is complete and merit is fulfilled, there is no need for the Great Return of jade elixir to ascend on high. All these are the means by which one advances from the mortal to the immortal, from the immortal to the perfected. When the perfected merge with the Dao, they are called divine beings. Divine beings can preserve or dissolve, conceal or illuminate; they emerge beyond the mechanisms of transformation and enter the vast desert of the primordial. Without intent, they perceive the mysterious; without wings, they soar. They sport in the halls of luminous clouds, feast in the chambers of feathered light, rejoicing through boundless eons, their longevity equal to the great void—immeasurable.

This Dao is inscribed upon golden tablets; how could its profound mysteries be lightly disclosed? Those who love learning should open the jade seals to explore its secrets.

Furthermore, the Confucian and Mohist traditions revere loyalty, filial piety, kindness, and love. The teachings of the immortals extend blessings to kings and lords, bestow fortune upon ancestors, and extend prosperity to descendants. Among these three, which is the greatest?

Alas! The origins of antiquity cannot be known in detail, but since the times of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor, figures like Guangcheng, Chisong, Lingwei, and Anqi have appeared in every age. Some are recorded in bamboo and silk, while others are known through recent accounts. If they could attain such heights, then immortality can be learned—how resplendent! Why not strive for it? From ancient times to the present, those who have succeeded shine as brightly as these two examples. Let all gentlemen take heed.

The heart and eyes discuss what gives rise to human existence: spirit is what is born, while form is what it relies upon. Within the square inch of the heart lies the numinous treasury. When still, spirit flourishes and form harmonizes; when restless, spirit labors and form perishes. Deep roots and tranquil extremes—these are the means to cultivate one’s nature and emotions.

Yet the heart agitates the spirit, and the eyes disorder the heart. Nothing strays further from truth and departs more from the root than these. Thus, I borrow the heart and eyes to expound this discourse, hoping to dispel obstructions and purify the spirit.

The heart aspires to non-action, yet the eyes disturb it. It admonishes the eyes: "I wish to forget emotions and withdraw, to follow my nature and embrace the subtle, to repose in the realm of great harmony, to wander the crossroads of the four directions, to transcend the realm of life and death, to enter the ultimate of spirit and brightness, to ride the primordial chaos in distant flight, to merge with the boundless vastness. Why, when I seek stillness, do you gaze? When I seek purity, do you scheme? You survey the myriad forms to muddy my rectitude, delight in beauty to drain my essence, entangle me in the unseen, immerse me in the transient, sway me upon the spring terrace, grieve me in the autumn fields, congeal my emotions in the fertile soil, stir my hair white at the gates of heaven, gaze toward Chu with longing, look down upon Qi’s outskirts with tears. The myriad thoughts that assail me—all are the dazzling illusions of your pupils. Though the body indulges in fine adornments, the mouth craves rich flavors, the ears delight in sweet sounds, and the nose savors fragrant scents—do these not all arise from your dominion? You govern the senses, yet you do not prioritize what is essential. You incite me to excess, yet it is you who bear the blame."

The eyes, indignant, reply: "Have you not heard that one man upholds the standards of the nine provinces? The principle lies in aligning with the ruler above; disorder arises from following the steps below. Thus, even the customs of Yao could be honored, for they all conformed to the imperial norm. As the ruler of form, when I am defied, I withdraw; when obeyed, I act. Auspicious omens gather through my favor, while regrets and misfortunes accumulate through my neglect. Therefore, those who govern others establish order before chaos arises; those who preserve the Dao concentrate their thoughts before they scatter. How can one quell rebellion afterward, or maintain steadfast observation when the five emotions have already erupted? Why not still your mechanisms? I, in my clarity, distinguish right from wrong, lament what is lacking, and am swept away by the tumultuous dance of things. The spirit of phenomena and their reflections—all are your doing. The masses may be led astray, but you should preserve your subtlety. Instead, you discriminate among things, rejoice in glory, grieve in disgrace, delight in the wind’s lift, hasten like a shooting star or lightning—all to pursue your desires. Having muddied your truth, you stray from the celestial heart and defy the celestial balance, lost at the ford of nature. Thus, I am compelled to serve your inclinations. Alas! Now that you are ensnared by this filth, you turn and blame me. What fault is mine?"

The heart, solemn and silent for a long while, finally speaks: "Since the myriad things are the source of affliction, let us together transcend the dust and its vexations. For whom do I harbor enmity? Though customs differ across lands, who can fathom their intent?"

How vast the gulf between concealment and revelation! In the *Collected Works of Master Zongxuan*, the heart, as the abode of the numinous, asks: Though the Four Seas lie sundered, how can one remain unengulfed by the tides of creation?

The eye replies: Turn inward, and you shall find the mystery shared. Now, let us choose the path we tread—toward the realm of purity and stillness, where one feasts on the luminous qi, drinks the morning light, chews jade blossoms, and rinses the mouth with nectar. There, we may await the transformation of the spirit into wings, soaring through clouds and mist, ascending to the Three Clarities, descending beyond the Eight Wastes, befriending the pine and the immortals, and abiding with heaven and earth as our constant. What harm can slander or praise bring? What need is there to cling to or discard?

I recite this vision to you—shall I declare it good or ill?
The eye says: It approaches the mark, yet falls short of perfection.

For in such a state, one seeks stillness yet is pursued by restlessness; one shuns the dust yet is stained by its residue. Midway in the return to the root, one stands distant and alone. The essence of the subtle and formless—coiled, it has no within; unfurled, it has no without. Boundless and vast, dark and unfathomable, it has no counterpart. To cast aside this for that is to grasp the small and lose the great, to forget rest in shade and extinguish one’s shadow—how can one escape the snares of profit and harm?

Only when the empty chamber gives birth to whiteness does the Way and its virtue find their vessel. To sever human schemes before their signs appear is to let celestial principle meet of itself. Thus, the Mysterious Origin blunted its edges to contemplate the wondrous; Wenxuan stilled the heart to employ the form. The Lord of the Chariot found it in the formless; Guangcheng grasped it in the dark and profound. Yan Hui sat in forgetfulness to attain great penetration; Zhuangzi harmonized with heaven to refine his essence.

Tracing the virtues of the sages, we see they were not achieved through cunning schemes. For when the waves of disturbance cease and clarity shines through, the mirror remains bright though dust does not settle. Without withdrawing from the world in lofty flight, one finds peace within the square inch of the heart. Thus, one abides in constant tranquility, responds yet emerges unscathed, shines without radiance, remains hidden without secrecy. Who can distinguish its beginning from its end? It is one with the myriad things.

In this, nothing is gained, yet nothing is lost. Truly, it is to follow the path of the level road and preserve primordial auspiciousness. But to abandon the center in pursuit of externals is to tread a path that grows ever more obscure. Why is this so?

Water gathers, and the dragon coils; forests flourish, and beasts dwell within. The spirit nests in the hollow void; the Dao gathers in the mysterious emptiness. If one does not first refine what one possesses, how can one grasp what one lacks? Without forgetting the form and stilling the heart, without polishing the mirror of imperfections until the mysterious gate shines and the hidden lock opens, how can one cross to the realm of no burdens?

Otherwise, how could one ride the Eight Radiant Ones, ascend the Nine Heavens, gaze upon the resplendent Golden Towers, or wander the vast Purple Courts? How could one share in the boundlessness of the great kalpa, where ten thousand ages are but a single morning?

At this, the heart releases its myriad cares, settles its hesitations, and clarifies like still water. It acts without haste, then turns to the eye and says in gratitude: You have blessed me with the good Dao, expanded me with ultimate words, awakened me from the great dream, revealed to me the profound mystery, raised me upon the true steps, and ushered me through the wondrous gate. You have set me free in the boundless wilderness and let me wander the inexhaustible source.

Neither bound to the crowd nor solitary, neither still nor restless, I harmonize with the joy of utmost ease, embrace the true essence, and endure forever. To cast it away is not to cast it away; to delve deeper is to delve ever deeper. I penetrate the ancestor of creation and reach the heart of heaven and earth.

You have enabled me to see beyond the blindness of the eyes, to perceive in the forest of the mysterious and yellow, to behold being as if it were empty silence, to hear the *Shao* music as if it were the echo of a valley. With nature as my companion, I take non-desire as my friend. I cease my frantic pursuit of lordship, preserve what comes after heaven, stifle desires before they arise, and resolve entanglements before they disturb. I forget the vastness of heaven and earth, overlook the minuteness of a hair’s tip. In solitude, I hear harmony; submerged in the turbid, I see the dawn. I respond to things in their cycles, contain my light, and close my gates. Though the whirlwind shakes the sea and the swift thunder splits the mountains, though the deluge drowns the earth and fire consumes the marshes, I remain at ease. What need have I to ponder their movements or silences?

**On the Harmony of Form and Spirit**

I have long pondered the essentials of the great Dao and the subtleties of its mechanism, which invariably return to emptiness and nothingness. Emptiness and nothingness, in turn, return to spontaneity. Spontaneity is that which is so of itself, without knowing why.

Thus, spontaneity gives birth to emptiness and nothingness; emptiness and nothingness give birth to the great Dao; the great Dao gives birth to the primal qi; the primal qi gives birth to heaven and earth; heaven and earth give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things emerge from the splitting of the single primal qi.

Therefore, heaven attains the One and spontaneously becomes clear; earth attains the One and spontaneously becomes tranquil—thus enduring long. When humans attain the One, why do they not share the longevity of heaven and earth, only to meet with ruin? It is because they are hastened by the mechanisms of desire.

Thus, the *Scripture of Mystic Harmony* states: If one severs the twelve excesses and embraces the primordial One, one may attain long life. The *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain* also says: Constantly contemplate consuming the primordial essence, refine the fluids to solidify the form, practice embryonic breathing to still the hundred passages, explore the three transformations in solitude, and illuminate the Niwan Palace with radiant light—thus becoming an immortal of golden blossoms. This is how one may share the longevity of heaven and earth and the brilliance of the sun and moon.

Yet the gate stands wide open, and none understand how to enter—is this not lamentable? Though I am unworthy, I dare to expound upon this. I see those who toil in mediocrity, those of limited vision within the Daoist gate, who know nothing of guarding the Dao and wearing the black, nurturing the form and preserving the spirit, or the defense of the golden elixir.

Some are the state’s esteemed ministers, pillars of the altars of soil and grain, versed in the Confucian classics. The higher their rank and emoluments, the less they know of the arts of nurturing life, the way of transforming the form, the principles of returning essence, or the wonders of replenishment. Often, I see their bodies wither and their lives end prematurely—truly a cause for sorrow.

Now, I shall expound upon the ancient worthies’ precedents and arrange them into five chapters.

Though my talent is insufficient to compose literature, and my words inadequate to form discourse, I shall briefly outline the essential principles of right and wrong.

Let those who guard the Dao draw from emptiness and spontaneity, aligning with the singular truth of the upright and real. Let those who wear the black know the wonders of pre-dual embryonic breathing, which endures unbroken as if ever-present. Wash away the Three Corpses, and with each day’s fulfillment, ascend to the supreme within the mysterious. Those who compound the elixir refine lead to extract gold, transmute stone into liquid, and within the chamber of the spirit’s vessel—the crucible—subdue mercury to forge the golden elixir. A single grain enters the mouth, and one’s years align with heaven and earth. To awaken is to perceive clearly; to remain deluded is to be ensnared by mere words.

May later learners examine and ponder this, that they may not err even once. If all ranks cultivate alike yet fail to resonate, let those who attain it seal their senses, and those who seek it meditate in stillness. What worry then that the tally of signs will not align, or that the sprouting of the great Dao will not arise?

As for guarding the Dao—
The Dao is the principle and substance of non-action, the original source of the mysterious and wondrous, the mother of spontaneity, the ancestor of emptiness. Loftier than the vault of heaven, deeper than the embrace of earth, it is the origin of heaven and earth, the root of the myriad things. Should one seek to compare or equal it, no thing can suffice; should one attempt to fathom or measure it, no thought can reach.

Within the primordial undifferentiated, it stands as the first—yet none see what precedes it. At the tip of a hair’s end, it dwells as the last—yet none see what follows it. Should a single person preserve it, no excess is heard; should heaven and earth preserve it, no lack is heard. Vast and boundless, distant and indistinct, if one can guard it, heaven and earth lie in the palm of the hand.

Thus Qi Bo said: The people of high antiquity who knew the Dao modeled themselves upon yin and yang, harmonized with the protective and defensive cycles, regulated their diet, ordered their rising and resting, acted without contrivance, and engaged in affairs without entanglement. Thereby they could softness subdue hardness, yin govern yang, turbidity master clarity, and weakness overcome strength. If one does not retreat from the marrow, one may guard the great Dao.

The great Dao is such that the more one diminishes, the less one gains; the more one loses, the less one attains. Those who augment it and attain it are perfected beings of utmost truth. Augmentation refines the form; attainment enters the profound and obscure. Gaining this profound obscurity, one resonates with the numinous and bright.

The *Garden of Persuasion* says: When mountains are high, clouds and rain arise; when waters are deep, fish and giant turtles gather; when a person guards the Dao, fortune arrives of itself.

As for the arts of primordial blackness—since high antiquity, brush and ink have not recorded them. Only when a determined seeker cuts their flesh and pledges in blood may the oral instructions be transmitted. Even such texts as the *Upper Clarity* prohibitions, the *Jade Casket’s* hidden writings, the various schools of the Hundred Masters, transmitted words and texts, or even the secret decrees of Lord Lao, the *Inner* and *Outer Yellow Court* scriptures—none reveal their essence openly. The Five Thousand Characters of the True Writ merely hint: the Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Though its branches and leaves appear manifest, its root and stem lie deeply concealed.

Whenever I have examined the various arts of blackness or encountered those who practice them, within ten years or five, their bodies have perished. In my own life, I have cherished the Daoist arts, my aspiration fixed upon primordial harmony. Yet whenever I have inquired among Daoist adepts, I find them discoursing endlessly in a thousand divergent ways. Some eat only from midnight to noon; some drink the saliva of the five sprouts. Some practice exhaling the old and inhaling the new, or lie supine with limbs outstretched.

Some consume the essences of sun and moon; some seal their orifices, or even abstain from grain entirely. Examining these practices, one finds death comes most swiftly. Why? Because they assault the internal while receiving the external, thus hastening their end.

The *Baopuzi* states:
*"Two halves ascend to merge as one,
Round as a pellet, golden as citrus,
Within its savor sweet as honey—
Hold fast to this and guard it well,
For should you grasp it, all affairs are complete."*

Thus the efficacy of blackness resembles a measuring vessel, or water flowing in its course: when the dam breaks, the water rushes downward; when the orifices are sealed, blackness cannot abide. Simply do not obstruct the natural breath of ingress and egress. Nurture the spirit through embryonic refinement, secure primordial harmony, and contain the Great Dao.

If one comprehends embryonic breathing, one understands primordial blackness—for embryonic breathing and primordial blackness are one and the same. The *Classic of Virtue* says: *"One may turn back galloping steeds to spread manure, like an infant who has not yet learned to cry."* Thus the *Tortoise Shell Scripture* declares: *"My life rests with me, not with Heaven."* "Not with Heaven" means knowing primordial blackness.

Man and heaven-and-earth each partake of a single blackness. Heaven-and-earth endure long, while man often dies young—why? Because he exhausts his blackness. Blackness is spirit; man is the spirit’s chariot, its chamber, its master. When the master is tranquil, the spirit dwells within; when restless, the spirit departs. When the spirit departs, the body dies.

**Nurturing Form**
Before man’s signs appear, heaven-and-earth are clear and serene. Splitting the Dao’s singular blackness, inheriting the residue of parental conception, one is born from emptiness and assumes a body. Once formed, the spirit attaches to it; once the spirit resides, blackness abides within. These three—body, spirit, and blackness—mutually sustain one another, enabling one to match the lifespan of heaven-and-earth and shine as brightly as the sun and moon. Why? Because one cultivates the body with care, nurtures primordial blackness, refines the organs through embryonic breathing, preserves the spirit through visualization, embraces emptiness and guards non-being, and reveres the One of the August.

The *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: *"Know the One, and all affairs are complete"*—thus do spirit and form unite. The *Baopuzi* states: *"If a man does not know how to nurture life, how can he act for life? If a man has never walked at night, how can he know what night-walking is?"* Thus those who nurture the spirit and cultivate the body live long, while those who abandon the spirit for desire die young.

Do not act contrary to principle and ruin the fine treasure of longevity. The Way of yin and yang begins with this body—embodying form, the spirit remains whole and unified. When the heart stirs, form and spirit scatter. Desire must not be indulged; indulgence leads to ruin. The spirit must not be humiliated; humiliation leads to harm. Once harmed, there is no return; once decayed, there is no revival.

Simply restrain cravings, renounce excess, and the hundred bones will align, the myriad transformations will settle. Should one neglect proper conduct, one’s years cannot be assured, and one may fear strength will not suffice. Why?

If one were to cast stubborn ice into a precious mirror or sail a stone boat upon the waves, neither ghosts nor gods could aid it, nor could heaven and earth set it in motion. When a clay figurine seeks the Dao in darkness, it may cleave to the spirit and partake of the One, acquiring this bodily form—yet if it cannot guard and nurture it, but instead schemes to amass surplus wealth, holds feasts to cast Buddha statues, chants scriptures and hymns, and prays to ghosts and gods to secure its form, it is like trying to stop boiling by adding firewood or spinning silk from frayed threads—how could such efforts succeed?

The form and the spirit must ever be tended with care. To indulge the passions in color, sound, fragrance, and taste—delighting the emotions, confounding the will, and disturbing the heart—these three things bring ruin to the body, defy the Dao, dissolve the form, and sink the bones, for they are the very source of self-destruction.

**Guarding the Spirit**
Man is born and takes shape when the One divides its *qi* to become the body, endowing it with the semblance of a kingdom: *qi* abides within it, and the spirit dwells there, bringing peace. The body is the vessel of the Dao; those who know this and refine it are called sages. Yet how is it that men, having gained the spirit, cannot guard it; having gained *qi*, cannot refine it; having gained essence, cannot return it? They cast themselves away—how then can they blame heaven and earth for failing to protect them?

As the *Yellow Book* states: "Man forms his body through the accumulation of *qi*; retaining the embryo and preserving essence ensures long life. The span of heaven-appointed years is clearly manifest." The *Baopuzi* says: "In ancient times, men discarded their wives; in this age, men discard their own bodies. Why? Because they do not understand how to return essence and refine *qi*—thus they are cast aside."

Moreover, the interplay of yin and yang is the Way of heaven and earth. A man cannot be without a wife, nor a woman without a husband. The union of male and female in yin and yang accords with the Great Dao, but without restraint, principle is lost, and the form dissolves, the bones sink into decay. According to the *Secret Instructions of Lord Lao*, the *Inner and Outer Yellow Court Scriptures*, the *Upper Clarity Prohibitions*, the *Hidden Writ of the Jade Casket*, the *Red Writ of the Yellow Emperor*, and the *True Instructions of Master Chonghe*, the Way of yin and yang is resplendently clear. The *Secret Instructions* say:

*"I dare not act as host, nor as guest;
Beware of casting yourself from high places.
Preserve inner contemplation, seal all crevices,
Straighten the outer posture, lower the sack, and arch the spine.
Fourfold and fivefold harmony—then the Dao naturally fuses.
Inhale essence, exhale *qi*, subtly they will commune.
The numinous stalk, no longer empty,
At times jade ramparts repair prior merit.
How to repair? The Gate of the Mysterious Female,
Open and harmonious.
Dredge the hundred channels, fill the brain with blood—
Husband and wife together ascend as immortals; this is the Way.
To seek boundless longevity,
Discern the signs when the yin portal opens."*

The Master of Great Yang and the Valley Yin Woman say: *"I move the Green Dragon and White Tiger,
While they move the Vermilion Bird and Soaring Serpent.
East nine, west seven,
South three, north five, with one at the center.
Return essence, refine *qi*,
And replenish my body.
Void enters, fullness departs—
Refine my viscera,
And I may live without end."*

The *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* states: *"Winter grass, when covered, does not die;
Exposed, it is harmed.
Fire arises from wood—
Disaster strikes without fail.
Essence arises from the body—
When essence is exhausted, death follows."*

Man’s *qi* and spirit are easily sullied and difficult to purify, easily united yet difficult to clarify. Those who know this and refine them truly attain long life. Have you not seen the whale, cast from the water, devoured by ants and crickets? Man, failing to guard his spirit, is consumed by worms and maggots. Those who attain the Dao are like fish that ever swim in the marsh—they do not dry up. If man but firmly preserves his *qi*, he shall not die.

All men desire long life yet do not know how to benefit essence and transform the form. All fear death yet do not know how to guard the spirit and secure *qi*. Those who can follow this path will spare their sons the sorrow of a father’s death and their younger brothers the grief of an elder’s passing. Then they may grasp the formless wind and seize the invisible—heaven’s appointed years will naturally endure.

**The Golden Elixir**
The great medicine of the Golden Elixir, though recorded in texts with hidden and manifest meanings, is better learned through oral instruction than through reading, better witnessed than heard, and better transmitted by hand than seen. Yet before one’s cultivation aligns with the truth, one must first honor the singular *qi*.

Its medicine: metal and earth pair with heaven and earth; dragon and tiger generate marrow; hun and po become husband and wife; the tortoise and serpent are the two maidens. The noon spirit originally holds four positions; the three *qi* return to guard the two. Through symbolic resonance, the dragon is achieved; the alarmed maiden lingers. Lead yields its gold, stone yields its water. Following the seasons and observing the sequence, the sun and moon align in their course.

The worthy await the practice of the Way—north’s water and metal are the key. Radiant, the returning elixir is formed: its dark and yellow hues blaze, its cinnabar and ochre glow, resplendent and magnificent. The sun, moon, and five stars cannot compare to its luster.

Yin generates, yang grows—transformation knows no bounds. Soaring through the azure vault, roaming the vast and mysterious, drifting through the Great Simplicity, returning to emptiness and truth, the body is shaped by the workings of creation. Taking the knife-point of the elixir into the mouth, one shares heaven and earth’s longevity, may fly with the phoenix and hound, and elevate one’s dwelling—this is called the numinous sage, the response of the perfected.

**Twenty-Four Poems of Wandering Immortals**
Unrolling the scrolls to survey past records,
I stir my heart to ponder present sentiments.

Ever since antiquity, all has been still and silent—
why then does the world bustle so restlessly?
Awakening to the wondrous subtleties of the Nine Immortals,
one transcends all to preserve the purest essence.
Concentrating the spirit, one merges with the profound and mysterious;
transforming the body, one bathes in the Great Clarity.
The heart expands to the vastness of the cosmos,
the form becomes as light as clouds and mist.
Auspicious winds blow beneath the feathered canopy,
propitious skies brush the rainbow banners.
The dragon-drawn chariot ascends to the Purple Tenuity,
beyond heaven, one safeguards an eternal name.
How could it compare to the scholars of the mortal realm,
who pride themselves on fleeting glory in caps and carriages?

At dawn, I ascend a thousand-fathom peak,
gazing down upon the dwellings of the four peoples.
Across the plains and fields, cities and towns are scattered;
mountains and rivers divide the hamlets by measure.
How distant seem those mired in the dust,
vying in the clamor of fame and profit!
A hundred years pass, and honor and disgrace are spent;
ten thousand affairs—all prove empty.
Since ancient times, none have achieved true success—
how could I join you in such pursuits?
I shall await the moment to ride the radiance of clouds,
transcending traces to ascend the celestial thoroughfare.
Phoenixes and simurghs nest in jade groves,
roc and parrot gather on level plains.
Their drinking and pecking differ in delight,
their soaring forever leads to separate realms.
I now cast aside the clamor of the world,
resolving to emulate those who rise on high.
I untie the bonds of earthly attachments,
and join the chorus beyond the heavens.
Who says the path to heaven is distant?
Resonance knows no obstruction.
Pitying the world’s inevitable decay,
I seek the immortals to escape dissolution.

Three Primes bear true ones—
with me, they share the bones of the Dao-born.
At dawn’s first light, I drink the cinnabar radiance;
by night, I sup the yellow moon.
A hundred passages grow ever harmonious,
the square inch of the heart grows ever clearer.
Dwelling in spirit, I merge with emptiness and nothingness,
penetrating all in a flash of insight.
Unwitting, I follow the Jade Emperor,
burning incense to approach the Golden Gates.
The Western Tortoise has just aligned the threads,
the Eastern Flower has already inscribed the names.
The Three Offices bear no lingering reproach,
the seven ancestors ascend to plow the clouds.
The body, refined, is cut off from worldly dust;
the heart, subtle, unites with the transformations of the mysterious.
One morning, I emerge from heaven and earth—
a hundred million years, yet still a child.
Thus I equal the boundless kalpas,
serene in the Jade Clarity.
The spirit rests in the numinous palace,
luminous, containing purity and stillness.
The scriptures of immortals do not deceive me—
light ascent is indeed proven true.
Long have I cherished the yearning for the Dao;
now, at last, heaven takes pity.
Is this not the fruition of hidden virtue,
verified by ascension in broad daylight?
Why trouble to pass through grotto-heavens?
I shall surpass the Crimson Mound.
The bones are refined, the body grows ever purer,
the mirror of perception is cleansed of dust.
Tranquil and at ease, the cosmos is at peace;
brilliant and clear, the light of heaven shines through.
Feathered robes mingle with mist and sky,
the childlike face gleams like ice and snow.
Hidden talismans startle a thousand demons,
jade chimes delight the ten thousand emperors.
Thus, within the realm,
perverse qi is forever extinguished.
The lofty perfected are indeed remote—
yet the Dao, in harmony, does not forsake me.
Who says Mount Guye is distant?
Deities and mortals may sport together.
I harness my chariot to follow them,
drifting beyond the edges of heaven.
No need to govern—people transform of themselves;
the spirit congeals, and things bear no flaw.
Thus I know that the purest resonance
suffices to harmonize the four seasons.

The Azure Sea stretches boundless,
the Three Mountains rise without end.
Golden terraces array the midst of heaven,
feathered ones roam and rest at will.
Morning dew may be drunk at dawn,
rainbow mushrooms savored at dusk.
Whistling and singing, the heart forgets itself;
soaring aloft—what need for wings?
Preserving life like the Three Luminaries,
how could one count the eons in thousands of millions?

I shall pass the Palace of the Supreme Emperor,
engraving my visit to the Fusang’s abode.
The True Youths have already drawn near,
clearing the lingering mists for me.
Sea deities calm their towering waves,
Xihe halts her galloping steeds.
Five-colored clouds weave layered pavilions,
Eight Sceneries set the flying chariots in motion.
Azure mists may be embraced,
the Cinnabar Terrace glimpsed in passing.
They detain me to feast in the Jade Hall,
the returning carriage is not hurried away.
I long to surpass the Cavern-Yang realm,
to gaze upon the farthest reaches of the cinnabar pole.
The Red Emperor leaps upon the fire dragon,
the Flame Official reins the vermilion crow.
Guiding me to ascend the Crimson Palace,
I stretch forth beyond the heavens’ edge.
The Yang spirit blazes in radiant splendor,
four directions—how dazzlingly bright!
For you, I pour forth the balmy winds,
so that grasses may grow without withering.

I then journey to the Queen Mother of the West,
my flying canopy soaring beyond the western limits.
Thus I enter the Plain Heaven,
halting my wheel beside the Great Obscurity.
The *ruohua* brushes the streaming light,
preventing the white sun from hiding.
The slanting rays return to midday,
the six directions know no twilight.
The transformations of the Dao follow resonance and change—
who can fathom this principle?
At dawn, I cross north of the Weak Waters;
by dusk, I rest upon Mount Zhong’s summit.
Zhuanxu’s Pure Mystery Palace,
Yuqiang sweeps the hidden realm.
The Torch Dragon emits divine radiance,
the dark wilds blaze with brilliance.
Guiding the harmony of the Three Qi,
driving away stillness from the Six Heavens.
Jade towers glow in mutual splendor,
misty guests—how elegant and fine!
One lift of the wings crosses the Ford of Rosy Clouds—
a thousand years pass in an instant.

I raise my canopy to reach the Starry Ultimate,
riding the mist to wander the Gates of Wind.
The Upper Prime descends through the Jade Portal,
the Queen Mother opens the Jasper Palace.
How thronged the celestials!
A grand assembly in the Azure Hall.
Attendants arrayed, they offer cloud-songs,
true melodies fill the vast sky.
The thousand-year purple crabapple ripens,
the four-kalpa spirit melon abounds.
This joy differs from the desolate frontier—
rapturous, it knows no end.
I harness my chariot to bid farewell to the Five Peaks,
parting the misty waves of the Nine Skies.
Amidst the boundless Great Void,
feathered banners beckon one another.
I glance back—the Penglai is near;
who says the Kunlun is distant?
Leisurely, I settle at ease,
looking up to attend the Three Heavens’ court.
How sinuous the nine dragons!
Bearing me upward along the cloud’s warp.
Gazing down, I cherish the old kingdom—
wind and dust mingle in vast obscurity.
How distant the mortal realm,
how near the Emperor’s land!
Above, I surpass the stellar reckoning;
below, I regard the sun and moon’s light.
Having cultivated myself, I pass the Grand Tenuity—
the heavenly abode shines resplendent.
I halt my banner beside the Great Regulator,
adjusting my robes before the Golden Gates.
Reverently, I attend the Supreme Emperor;
resonantly, I join the assembly of transcendent immortals.
The Vast Crucible emits numinous sounds,
the Great Hemp unfurls the Celestial Harmony.
The jade body is at ease in the central seat,
rosy clouds rise to fill the four banquets.
This blessed era knows no end—
gazing and turning, a hundred million years pass.
The wondrous gate of the steep and bright opens;
the mirror of truth, clear and subtle, connects.
Upon the Nine Rosy Clouds of the Jade Grove,
within the Three Heavens’ Golden Pavilion.
Flying rainbows leap through auspicious clouds,
soaring cranes ride the numinous winds.
Lush is the Jade Capital’s gathering—
the immortal tryst unites the six directions.

I ascend to the Primordial Yang’s origin,
longing to rest amid the radiant rosy clouds.
The jade wheels rise, drifting,
the golden light scatters, dazzling.
Emptiness congeals into the ten thousand beings;
the lofty and wondrous are all attainable.
Jade mountains rise, towering and jagged;
the Lang Sea stretches, boundless and distant.
A moment’s delight surpasses a thousand joys—
who could reckon the distant years?

Gathering purple-clad Yang friends,
we feast together at the Jade Clarity Terrace.
Arraying radiance, feathered robes flutter;
floating through the void, cloud chariots arrive.
The numinous banners stir the Seven Luminaries;
the jade screens open the Ninefold Brilliance.
Phoenixes dance as dragons proudly play their tunes;
rainbow carriages linger, never turning back.
Ascending high above the Purple Ultimate,
we banquet on this mystic summit of the Dark Capital.
Jade elixirs scatter rare fragrance;
jade branches flow with refined melody.
A spirit wind rises from the Great Desert,
gently brushing our robes.
Our forms merge with the vastness of the formless;
our spirits congeal in the depths of emptiness.
Far beyond the cosmos,
we attain the heart of heaven and earth.

I summon the Three Clarities’ friends,
soaring beyond the Nine Heavens.
Amid the boundless desert’s expanse,
we drift apart yet gaze afar.
The Great Void holds eternal brightness;
beyond the eight directions, no barriers remain.
Simurghs and phoenixes spread their free wings,
soaring lightly at will.
In the vastness of primal emptiness,
supreme joy lies in the spirit’s sovereignty.
Releasing ourselves upon the rosy clouds,
we float ethereally in the void.
The Eight Powers lead the way;
the Five Elders roam with me.
How resplendent is the numinous radiance!
Auspicious winds now softly sigh.
Flute songs resound through the endless sky,
their clear, gentle echoes drifting.
No earthly delights compare;
all companions here are true immortals.
Not swift yet naturally fast,
we circle the ten thousand heavens in an instant.
Returning to gaze before the Great Beginning,
we merge utterly with the Dao.
Emptiness crystallizes into true essence,
becoming substance within the void.
Transformation follows constant nature;
union and dispersal have no fixed form.
Not moving, yet swifter than lightning,
concealed brilliance outshines the sun.
Abiding in profound mystery,
without attainment, there is no loss.

**Ten "Stepping the Void" Hymns**

All immortals revere the numinous model,
solemnly driving their chariots to the divine origin.
Golden radiance illuminates in mutual splendor,
winding upward into the Great Void.
The Seven Mysteries have soared high;
fire refinement births the Vermilion Palace.
Residual blessings extend through heaven and earth,
harmony fuses with the kingly Dao.
The Eight Powers purify the journey’s mist;
the Ten Perfections dance in auspicious winds.
They enable me to ascend the Yang’s origin—
this comes from the merit of former deeds.
Roaming freely above the rosy clouds,
the true mirror leaves nothing obscure.
Reining in the swift steed, I mount the Purple Clarity,
riding the light beyond racing lightning.
Hearing the wind across three heavens,
I look down and still see it clearly.
Jade gates mark the bright expanse;
jade groves flourish in lush verdancy.
Had I not tempered my golden bones,
how could I fulfill my long-cherished wish?
True companions gather in abundance,
their united radiance reveling in joyous feasts.
A fine gathering forgets its duration—
a thousand years pass like a single moment.
The Three Palaces emit bright radiance,
illuminating together with the resplendent sun.
In profusion, they ascend the terrace to pay homage,
gathering the azure essence of the void.
They command my body to gleam golden,
and my form after heaven to shine with jade-like splendor.
My heart abides in the Great Void’s stillness—
in this vastness, what thoughts arise?
Within the mysterious lies supreme joy,
tranquil and effortless, ever without action.
Only with true and upright friends
do we drift and play in carefree delight.
Receiving transformation, we condense the primal qi,
refining our forms into true immortals.
Forgetting the heart accords with the primordial origin,
returning to the root and abiding in spontaneity.

**The Emperor’s Unity gathers in the Crimson Palace,**
flowing light emerges from the cinnabar mystery.
Wu Ying and Peach Lord
recite the "Longevity Ode" in clarity.
The Six Palaces glow with rosy clouds;
the hundred passages array purple mists.
Terrace chariots traverse the vast expanse,
gently riding the radiance as it shifts.
Unaware of the cloud paths’ distance,
in an instant we roam the ten thousand heavens.
Fusang gives birth to the first light;
feathered canopies greet the dawn’s rosy glow.
Swiftly we arrive at the Western City,
playing and roaming at the Queen Mother’s abode.
Azure streams brim with vast springs,
resplendent lotuses unfold.
The resplendent Azure Jade Palace
stands adorned with jade blossoms in rows.
True qi overflows the Crimson Palace,
naturally free from wayward thoughts.
Looking down in pity upon mortals,
how turbid and pitiable is the world!
Jade terraces measure eons in spans;
alone I sigh beyond the Great Veil.
Ever present are the Three Pure Clouds,
their congealed light swirling of its own accord.
Feathered radiance drifts on bright rosy clouds,
ascending and descending in misty ethereality.
Simurghs and phoenixes utter refined melodies,
perching and soaring among the crimson groves.
The Jade Void knows no day or night—
how radiant is the numinous light!
Once gazing upon the Supreme Capital,
one knows all heavens are small.
Resplendent are the Azure Flower Groves;
a spirit wind stirs the jade branches.
The Three Origins know no winter or spring;
a single qi, pure and harmonious.
Turning my head, I see the near and the distant;
my eyes behold the luminous web.
Expansive, this mastery over the Six Heavens,
the tinkling bells subdue a hundred demons.
Endless are the blessings—
who says longevity is long?
In lofty purity, no excess exists;
encountering things, they bloom with radiance.
Supreme joy is not in flute songs—
jade tones ring clear and resonant.
Now ascending the Terrace of Bright Truth,
we feast in this Hall of Feathered Radiance.
Misty vapors weave into jeweled clouds;
subtle fragrances scatter as numinous incense.
Truly, the immortals have much leisure—
their joy and peace are immeasurable.

Then from the Supreme Tenuity,
we pay homage to the Lord of the Void.
Lifting my Eight Radiance Chariot,
we slowly enter the Gate of Heaven.
Having ascended the Jade Dawn Court,
solemnly I look up to the Purple Canopy.
Daring to ask of the Dragon Han’s end,
how was heaven and earth opened?
Joyfully, he reports with pride,
revealing to me these subtle words.
Fortunate to hear the ultimate principle,
only now do I see the source of creation.
The two qi disseminate the ten thousand beings;
the mechanism of transformation knows no resting wheel.
Yet I grasp its beginning—
thus can I transcend the potter’s wheel.
Vast and boundless, ascending the Great Desert,
all I encounter is pure and true.
Limpid and lustrous, containing primordial harmony,
qi naturally unites in kinship.
Crimson trees bear cinnabar treasures;
purple rosy clouds flow with azure streams.
I vow to preserve the Divine Child,
forever transcending form and spirit.

**Reflections on Founding a Dynasty**

Once the fiery essence lost its rule,
the realm divided into three.
The King of Wu seized Jing and Yue,
establishing his capital by the Yangtze’s banks.
Relying on the strength of his ministers,
he brought peace to the Huai and the sea.
The King of Wei sought to cross with his army,
but halted by the river, he swiftly turned back.
Was it only the natural moat that hindered him?
His true fear lay in the presence of men.
Alas for the Marquis of Surrender,
whose debauchery ruined his former merit.
Bearing jade, he entered Luoyang,
offering himself as a subject to Jin.
Before long, his ancestral temples fell—
for this, he bore sorrow and bitterness.
Soon came the end of Yongjia,
as the Central Plains filled with barbarian dust.
Five horses floated across the river;
a single dragon leapt the Milky Way.
At that time, a great enterprise was forged,
truly relying on worthy officials.
Though the lands reclaimed were not vast,
the grand design was nonetheless majestic.
Lord Xie aided the royal house,
wielding his staff to sweep away the false Qin.
Who deemed the Wu forces weak?
Their use lay in proper order.
Fleeting, they held Qi and Song;
in an instant, they shifted to Liang and Chen.

Six dynasties have now unfolded in succession,
their rises and falls tangled in endless weave.
Not in natural barriers but in virtue lies security—
success and failure truly have their causes.
Lofty altars crumble into moats,
sprawling palaces collapse beneath brambles.
The royal wind has long since vanished,
yet the triumphant qi still swirls thickly.
The imperial house remains a single domain,
its mysterious transformation reaching boundless bounds.

We often speak of cosmic harmony,
yet suddenly clouds and thunder gather.
Gazing toward the outskirts of Liang and Song,
all is dim, shrouded in ominous vapors.
If only I held a sword that leans against the sky,
to sever this leviathan of the vast sea.
I linger as dusk falls over rivers and mountains,
moved to emotion—yet for whom can I express it?

**Inscribed at the Tomb of Yang Biao**
Summoned from the lands beyond the Yangtze,
I pause by the roadside where an ancient grave stands.
Bo Tao buried beside Jiao Ai,
his tomb near General Jing’s.
Though their paths as spirits diverged,
they took up arms to resolve their strife.
The ways of the unseen are truly hard to know—
victory and defeat defy all reason.
With a long cry, they cut their own throats,
a loyalty unheard of in ancient times.
Two worthies bound by deep affection—
what are mere flesh and blood to such a bond?
Moved by your shared roots from the beginning,
my heart too swirls with emotion.
I linger, halting my journey’s steed,
unaware of the empty forest’s intoxicating haze.

**Climbing Beigu Mountain to Gaze at the Sea**
This mountain guards Jingkou’s white cliffs,
jutting high above the azure sea’s edge.
What do I see as I ascend and look out?
Only the vast expanse of morning and evening tides.
Clouds rise from Penglai’s isle,
the sun climbs the branches of Fusang.
A thousand miles blend into one hue—
how can one distinguish the two forces of yin and yang?
I long to harness the misty chariot,
floating to seek Anqi.
With a wave of my hand, I bid farewell to the human realm—
from here, I shall depart.

**Passing Tianmen Mountain, Thinking of a Friend**
The sail hoisted, the wind strong,
our swift momentum like flight.
Drifting through misty waves,
the land surges and heaves.
Two mountains flank the blue-green river,
suddenly parting to open the Gate of Heaven.
In an instant, the light boat is far—
only the imagined lone islet remains.
The return journey nears with the setting sun,
my heart at ease, my soul consoled.
So many wondrous sights I’ve passed—
I long to discuss them with my friend.
A single day apart feels like three autumns,
our mutual longing only deepens.

**Encountering Liu Bocun on a Boat, Returning to Mount Songshan—Written in Tribute**
The shallow ways of the world have long been the custom,
true reclusion is hard to find.
Who could have known my unspoken hope
would be met in you, here on this small boat?
At a glance, the Dao was already present—
with a smile, words became unnecessary.
Moreover, I’ve seen your *Essay on Breaking Ties*
and read your *Admonitions for the Recluse*.
I see your boundless heart,
regarding the world as drifting clouds.
You return to the secluded valleys of Mount Song,
while I once more dwell on Mount Lu.
Though our forms may differ, our hearts are not apart—
who can sigh at such differences?
One day, should you come to visit,
do not refuse to ride the cool wind.

**Night Travel by Boat**
The boatman knows the river’s ways,
hoisting the sail to journey through the night.
I cannot discern the shapes of isles and shoals,
only hear the startling wind and waves.
Dark clouds drift ominously,
the setting moon dims, its light gone.
Do I not fear hardship and peril?
What sustains me is loyalty and sincerity.
When will this long night end?
I await the first glimmer of dawn.

**Arriving Late at Hukou, Seeing Mount Lu—Presented to Old Friends**
My night boat reaches Hukou,
gradually nearing Mount Lu’s side.
Towering high, it pierces the sky—
how steep and lofty it stands!
The Stone Mirror reflects the morning glow,
the furnace’s smoke congeals in the cold hue.
My travel-worn journey nears its rest,
my heart already ascends the heights.
The empty fame has long been a burden,
driving me to leave the realm of ease.
My true wish does not stray from the Dao—
at last, my hidden longing is fulfilled.
Old friends dwell in the clouds’ embrace—
together, we share in rest and joy.
Like the wild goose soaring into the blue,
Yu’s hunters have laid down their nets.

**Written in the Gloom of Endless Spring Rain**
The scaled dragon has moved to the south,
relentless rain drenches the riverbanks.
Looking down, the plains are lost;
gazing up, the towering peaks are veiled.
A chill wind stirs the warm air,
the waning moon grows desolate and cold.
The birds of the season hush their songs,
the fragrant blossoms too fade and wither.
Countless streams pour into rivers and lakes,
day and night swelling the waves.
Several gentlemen remain distant,
silent, with no one to share joy.
With wine, I briefly amuse myself;
for whom do I pluck the zither’s strings?
I play the *Melody of Sorrowful Rain*,
and when the song ends, I sigh deeply.
This sigh arises from the heart’s response to things—
who can fathom its source?
I write my thoughts to kindred spirits,
my words exhausted, yet my feelings linger.

**Responding to Magistrate Liu of Yexian, Who Has Taken Refuge on Mount Lu—In Memory of Secretary Zheng and His Brother, and Master Gou the Daoist Priest, with Whom He Has Been Reunited**
Wise men of true worth are rare indeed—
meeting you, I am moved to emulate your virtue.
Born with heavenly nobility,
you could well divide the jade tablet of office.
When the Luo and Yellow Rivers first seethed,
we hoped to sweep away the storm’s fury.
Yet fate did not align with the times—
how could we take up the drums of war?
From then on, I ceased my soaring flight,
casting off my official’s cap to leave the court.
I drove my carriage to the southern lands,
where loyalty and filial piety need not part.
Mount Lu stands guard over the river’s edge—
here, I find contentment in forest and retreat.
Entering the gate, I don robes of splendor;
leaving the valley, I lean on a staff of red blossoms.
The old village of Yinling has regained its renown,
and now flourishes once more.
Secretary Zheng has laid down his cap and sash,
his noble countenance shining by the pines’ stream.
How worthy is Master Gou, the hermit—
he has erased his traces to tend his garden.
Looking at myself, I am truly unworthy,
ashamed to have forgotten the fish trap and hare snare.
Together, we delight in the green wine,
our carefree thoughts flowing like cinnabar steps.
When the Dao is at peace, I shall wander far—
while the times are clear, do not lose your way.
Prince, do not hasten to return—
the fragrant grasses grow lush and deep.

*(Six characters missing in the original, supplied from *Complete Tang Prose*)*

**Collected Works of Master Zongxuan, Lower Scroll**
*Fourteen Poems on Viewing the Past*

The sage values universal relief,
illuminating the Dao to save the age.
Confucius’ mat was never warmed,
Mozi’s hearth remained unsmoked.
Rising to speak, they sought to mend decaying nets,
intending to uphold what must be upheld.
Yet ruler and minister vied in delusion,
and customs daily withered and declined.
The Three Dynasties’ legacy swiftly fell,
the Seven Warring States then clashed in haste.
All things plunged into fire and mire,
the world entangled like buried silk.
The First Emperor burned the arts of scholars,
leaving not a single scroll intact.
The Great Han arose through five reigns,
and this culture was once more exalted.
Thus was proven the truth of scriptures and Dao—
they share the world’s rise and fall.
Expansion and contraction are Heaven’s design;
how can teachings alone endure?
The rise and fall follow the Dao’s course,
adversity and prosperity complete their cycles.
Alas, the pure winds of antiquity,
once gone, never return again.

Three Sovereigns scattered simplicity,
Five Emperors first esteemed worthies.
Kingly rule and hegemonic might,
falsehood flourished day by day.
Loyalty and cunning, truth and deceit,
how could they be distinguished?
Excessive wisdom soared to the nine heavens,
clinging to ignorance sank to the Yellow Springs.
I ever cherish the age of nest-dwellers,
moved to tears, though vainly.
Thatched huts replaced nests,
a change that began with the Three Sovereigns.
Traces born become burdens,
foundations laid multiplied through a hundred kings.
Jade towers destroyed the Xia,
palaces of jasper brought down Tang.
The world never learns from overturned carts—
the Qin built Epang.
Following in blindness, they lost the right path,
the Han planned Jianzhang.
Forced labor exhausted ten thousand men,
rare treasures were gathered from eight directions.
Pursuing desires without limit,
their brief lives swiftly ended.
Where now is all that extravagance?
Thorns and brambles fill the ancestral halls.

In quietude, I survey the records of the past,
grieving for Shang and Qin.
What they destroyed were the loyal and good,
what they treasured were the cruel and bold.
Flatterers deemed themselves sagely,
unaware that ruin would consume them.
Jizi aided the Zhou,
Shusun Tong served the Han.
The *Great Plan* and rites,
later kings used as guiding threads.
I read the *Gathering Caltrops* and
again feel the *Green Flies* poem—
slander and flattery confound loyalty and filial piety,
a sorrow shared through all ages.
Treachery arises from cunning,
kin slaughter one another.
The Han heir fell to Jiang Chong,
the Jin successor to Li Ji.
Even natural bonds may be questioned,
how much more the ties of ruler and minister.
Zigu was boiled in Wu’s cauldron,
Wenzhong was slain by Yue’s blade.
Qu Yuan drowned in the Xiang’s flow,
his sorrow truly self-inflicted.
Why not be like Fan Li,
who sailed away in a small boat, never to return?

I have studied the true immortal Dao,
its purity dispels all cares.
The First Emperor and Han Wudi—
how could they enter its bounds?
Their minds troubled by myriad trifles,
their positions proud, lords of the four seas.
Having sought to precede the cosmos,
they still schemed to follow heaven and earth.
Plans lofty and far-reaching,
nothing could coexist with them.
Thus they indulged every desire,
wasting their vital roots in dissipation.
Golden elixirs only prolonged their days,
jade cups stirred their souls.
Expeditions exhausted distant lands,
slaughter and wounds covered the central plains.
Heaven’s judgment cannot be deceived,
divine principle cannot be obscured.
Anqi returned to Penglai,
the Queen Mother to Kunlun.
Their strange arts ultimately failed—
alas, what more can be said?

The Lord of Lu’s governance,
Confucius abandoned and cast aside.
The Han sovereign sought worthy talent,
Jia Yi was also sidelined and exiled.
The First Emperor prized Han Fei,
yet upon seeing him, did not preserve him whole.
Emperor Wu admired Sima Xiangru,
once summoned, forgot his worth.
Valuing the distant is common to all ages,
disdaining the present is shared by all.
Only now do I know that men of old,
were hard to emulate in their time.

Shi Ji was once unmet,
wandering in madness and poverty.
One morning, ruler and minister found accord,
his eloquence surged forth.
Planning the Han’s great enterprise,
he rode his carriage to subdue Qi’s cities.
Having reached the limits of his wisdom,
he was then consumed by it.
How much better to remain poor and lowly,
singing carefree, with no designs.

Chao Cuo held far-reaching strategies,
offering the ruler sound counsel.
He pared back the feudal lords’ power,
securing what was fitting for all time.
Treacherous ministers bore old grudges,
seizing opportunity to plot against him.
The world’s lord failed to discern,
his body was executed, his clan destroyed.
Emperor Jing was called wise and enlightened,
yet such miscarriages of justice still occurred.
Bigan and Longfeng—
their cruel fates were no cause for sorrow.

The Marquis of Jiang achieved great deeds,
his rewards rich, his rank exalted.
One morning, he faced the prison officers—
how could honor or disgrace be discussed?
Su Wu bore six seals,
his brilliance became the source of calamity.
King Father Mu ate from five tripods,
his fame sowed the roots of disaster.
Li Si aided two emperors,
ministers took turns at his gate.
Huo and Meng supported three rulers,
their sorrows extended to descendants.
Heaven and man abhor fullness,
this principle was clearly not heeded.
Only now do I know that those who gain their desires,
need not ride in vermilion carriages.

Extinguishing one’s light, dwelling in distant valleys,
plucking strings and singing to clear springs.
The Two Sus returned to the seashore,
Jiang Ling retired to his gardens.
Unfettered, they cast off worldly burdens—
this resolve was truly worthy.
The perfected man follows fortune and misfortune,
entrusting his life, free from blame.
I observe the Grand Historian—
he truly understood the Dao’s pattern.
To be detained was no cause for resentment,
his cherished life was but a fleeting span.

I sigh for Master Gong,
his integrity steadfast and unyielding.
Why did he conceal himself so late?
His heavenly years were cut short in his time.
The fragrant fat consumed itself,
the old man of Chu left only sorrow.
The enlightened value measuring their strength,
the perfected esteem knowing the signs.
Jing Fang probed the profound,
revealing all the mysteries.
Yet how could he swiftly condemn the great evil,
failing to see where calamity would return?
Plotting against others, he plotted against himself—
who would call this subtle and wise?

The Mysterious Origin knew when to stop,
the *Greater Odes* still prized self-preservation.
Ma Rong, master of vast learning,
his hidden traces encompassed all.
In youth, he composed the *Quail* poem—
truly he understood nurturing the young.
In later years, he longed for phoenixes,
soaring high, crying to the layered heavens.
Knowing advance but not retreat,
his Dao was thus exhausted.
Once he discerned the beginnings of fortune,
he was deluded by its end.
Only now is proven the truth of those who retreat in glory—
their purity endures like heaven and earth.

The sages left great teachings,
profound meanings not lightly set forth.
Heaven’s Dao brings misfortune to the stubborn and cruel,
divine brightness protects the virtuous and wise.
These words are like echo and shadow—
how can one return to the cave?
Gun’s obscurity gave birth to the brilliant and wise,
Yao and Shun nurtured the dull and perverse.
Why was Robber Zhi’s life prolonged,
while Yan Hui’s was cut short?
Duke Yin of Lu preserved his humility,
yet the seeds of disaster were secretly sown.

The tyranny of King Mu of Chu ran rampant,
yet where was his fortune’s blazing splendor?
Tian Heng murdered his lord,
yet his state endured unbroken for generations.
Guan Zhong preserved the hegemonic enterprise,
while Emperor Guangwu wove his cunning schemes.
When the Han house was in turmoil,
the traitorous clique indulged in deceit and treachery.
Yet steadfast men like Chen Fan,
zealously upheld their loyalty.
They vowed to pacify the realm,
to extirpate the wicked and vile.
But their plans met no support,
and soon they were condemned and destroyed.
Such cases through the ages,
are too numerous to recount.
The Dao is distant, its principles faint and obscure—
who can make them clear to me?
I would inquire of the Lord on High,
piercing the boundless void with my plea.
Enough—let me speak no more,
and seek forgetfulness to ease my heart.

**Ode to the Lofty Scholars**
The *Book of Changes* declares: the Dao of the noble man
may emerge or withdraw, be silent or speak.
For when he emerges and speaks,
he aids the times and brings order.
When he withdraws and is silent,
he abides in stillness to quell restlessness.
Thus, though he utters no word,
he nearly benefits all things—
how could he merely cultivate himself?
The Master said:
"Dwell in seclusion to preserve your resolve,
practice righteousness to fulfill your Dao."
This is what is meant by "a hundred thoughts converging as one,
diverse paths leading to the same end."
To love the same and hate the different
is the common nature of men.
From my youth, I have secretly revered true reclusion.
Gazing afar at the ancients,
I find my heart truly delighted.
Though I do not see those men of old,
their lingering influence is worthy of admiration.
If one seeks a model to emulate,
are not the masters of noble retreat the finest?
When admiration is not enough,
I take them as teachers and friends.
When teachers and friends are not enough,
I sing their praises in verse.
Thus I delight in my truth,
and in this way, it endures.
Long ago, Huangfu Mi, the Master of Dark Repose,
composed his *Biographies of Lofty Scholars* out of admiration.
Liang Boluan wrote his *Eulogies of Lofty Scholars*,
and now I offer my *Odes to the Lofty Scholars*—
each expressing the aspirations of its time.
The Great Beginning is vast and remote,
difficult to fathom in detail.
The lineage of Hongya and his kind
left no traces to record.
Thus I begin with the Primordial August Emperor
and conclude with Master Tao the Recluse.
I select the peerless,
clarify their standards,
and compose fifty odes
to chant their virtuous voices.

**Primordial August Emperor**
The Primordial Lord of the Nine Immortals,
his Dao crowned the inception of the Three Qi.
In response to things, he aided the mandate;
in dwelling in truth, he returned to his abode.
His writings left teachings for all time,
as he rode the light back to the Great Void.
Confucius sighed at the "hidden dragon"—
who could know where he went?

**Master Guangcheng**
Master Guangcheng reclined in his cloudy peak,
remote and vast beyond a thousand years.
The Yellow Emperor came, following the wind,
to seek his counsel on cultivating spirit and form.
His profound words revealed the mysteries of the Dao,
instructing him to follow the obscure and dark.
The Three Luminaries enter the infinite,
while silence and stillness return to Great Tranquility.

**Master Xu**
A great name revered by the worthy,
a precious rank cherished by sages.
Yet the radiant Xu Zhongwu
cast it aside like a speck of dust.
He abandoned his gourd by Mount Jishan,
washed his ears by the Ying River’s bank.
Beyond the world, in twin solitude,
he alone harmonized with the Dark and Serene.

**Master Fan**
How lofty was Master Chao’s resolve,
his hidden essence unknown to men.
He felt shame at the tale of yielding the throne,
and when offered the calf to drink, he moved away.
Unwilling to scatter the Great Simplicity,
how could he serve as Yao’s teacher?
Refining his truth, he ascended lightly,
leaving the floating world behind—what was there to regret?

**Gao of Xiangcheng**
When Great Yu received the abdication,
Gao of Xiangcheng declined the lords’ offers.
Retiring to the wilds beyond,
what did he seek in his wandering?
The Son of Heaven came to his field,
and with a single word, his worth was repaid.
Yet he but plowed on, heedless—
such a heart is too remote to match.

**Old Master Zang**
Old Master Zang hid in the valley,
his heart vast as he fished with his line.
King Wen, moved by a dream of old,
entrusted him with governance, and the Dao was fulfilled.
Following the art of non-action,
in three years, pure transformation spread.
When his work was done, he did not remain,
vanishing like the Void and Subtle.

**Bo Yi and Shu Qi**
Bo Yi and Shu Qi honored each other’s yielding,
abandoning their state to follow their reverence.
When they came to the House of Zhou,
they found it not to their hearts.
The world was too turbid to dwell in—
pristine as ice, they climbed Mount Shouyang.
Gathering ferns, they sang of Fuxi and Shen Nong,
their lofty integrity surpassing all antiquity.

**Perfected Man of Nanhua**
The Perfected Man of Nanhua traced the source of the Dao,
so profound and distant it could not be fathomed.
In motion, he roamed with creation;
in stillness, he merged with the Great Harmony’s rest.
Unbound beyond life and death,
he wandered the realm of spirit and brightness.
Moreover, with the aid of elixir pills,
he ascended lightly to the Great Ultimate.

**Perfected Man of Chongxu**
The Perfected Man of Chongxu embodied the subtlest truth,
his grasp of the Dao naturally profound.
He refused the salary of Ziyang,
drinking only from the Master of Huqiu’s spring.
Serene, with no attachment,
he soared through the vastness of space.
Was it the wind that bore him,
or was it he who rode the wind?

**Perfected Man of Dongling**
Kang Cang attained the utmost emptiness,
hiding his traces in distant peaks.
Wisdom departed, leaving only folly,
as days waned and years drew to their close.
His villagers sought to honor him as a spirit,
but he wished not to hear of sacrificial vessels.
To esteem the worthy was not the highest principle—
even Yao and Shun were thus deemed coarse.

**Perfected Man of Tongxuan**
The Perfected Man of Tongxuan valued hidden virtue,
benefiting things beyond the marketplace.
Leisurely by the great river,
his hair unbound, he plied his light oar.
He had already expounded the teachings of the black-draped tent,
and further composed the *Song of the Azure Waves*.
Where did he vanish in the end?
Only his writings remain, shining bright.

**Perfected Man of Wenshi**
The Perfected Man of Wenshi penetrated the source of the Dao,
concealing his light as a frontier guard.
From afar, he rejoiced at the floating purple qi,
and indeed, the Perfected Man arrived.
The mysterious decree had already been bestowed,
what were worldly honors to burden him?
With lofty steps, he traversed the Three Pure Realms,
ascending beyond the Nine Immortal Ranks.

**Rong Qiqi**
Rong Qiqi truly knew when to stop,
with a rope for a belt, he sought nothing.
External things were not his concern—
with zither and song, he wandered at ease.
The Three Joys connected him to the utmost Dao,
a single word intoxicated Confucius.
Abiding in constancy, awaiting his end,
what care had he for whistling and pride?

**Changju and Jieni**
How worthy were those men, Changju and Jieni,
who fled the world to preserve their truth.
Confucius, restless and wandering,
was still seeking the ford on his journey.
Their paths of action and concealment diverged,
how could their speech and silence share the same ethos?
Plowing together in the long forest,
content to dwell with the crows and sparrows.

**Yan He**
Worldly sentiments prize favor and fame,
eager to display their integrity in the moment.
Yet Yan He followed namelessness,
happily herding oxen for his own joy.
He spurned the court’s summons and its silken gifts,
delighting in his thatched hut’s simplicity.
Dwelling beyond the clamor of dust,
he roamed free, unknown to the world.

**Lao Lai and His Wife**
The Dao of the Lao family had long faded,
yet his virtuous wife’s purity only deepened.

A solitary retreat from the clamor of worldly cares,
eternally attuned to the clouds and valleys’ embrace.
Rank and emolument held no weight—
with a flick of his sleeve, he set forth on a distant journey.
Vast and boundless, his wish fulfilled,
how could mere things ensnare him?

**The Madman of Chu and His Wife**
Jieyu delved deep into the subtle and profound,
his wife no less a true and carefree spirit.
Proudly they spurned the court’s summons,
tilling and weaving in place of official stipends.
His phoenix song truly proclaimed the Dao,
his dragon virtue thus concealed in seclusion.
A single sojourn upon Mount Emei’s heights,
a thousand years preserving his numinous art.

**Xian Gao, the Zheng Merchant**
How noble was Xian Gao,
a merchant in hiding yet uniquely remarkable.
His stratagem saved the state of Zheng,
feigning command to offer gifts to the Qin army.
The gods’ reward for righteousness he refused,
serving the public while effacing self-interest.
With an empty heart he prized namelessness,
dwelling far away among the Nine Yi.

**Liuxia Hui**
Zhan Qin embraced purity and simplicity,
erasing his traces while blending with the dust.
Lofty sentiments left carriages and caps behind,
his lowered aspirations to save the world.
A hundred deeds left not a single blemish,
thrice dismissed, his Dao grew ever more true.
Truly his virtue surpassed the ancients—
how could it be measured by mere words?

**The Morning Gatekeeper and the Recluse with the Basket**
Bearing his basket, he tilled and wove in seclusion;
the morning gatekeeper silently guarded the pass.
The Dao was revered, though his name might be base,
his principles satisfied, his heart ever at ease.
Amid the clamor of right and wrong,
he roamed free through heaven and earth.
Together they mocked Confucius,
vanishing into the shadows, never to return.

**The Old Man of Hanyin**
How rustic was the old man of Hanyin,
who loved antiquity and thus forgot cunning.
Embracing his urn, he labored in earnest,
preserving simplicity to keep the Dao’s subtlety whole.
Zigong at first failed to grasp him,
but upon hearing his words, recognized their truth.
Having become a man of wind and waves,
he wandered, lost and without anchor.

**The Couple of Wuling**
How radiant was the man of Wuling,
his own worth clear, his wife no less enlightened.
They cherished the weight of Dao and virtue,
scorning the fleeting allure of worldly splendor.
Zither and books were their true pursuits,
rank and emolument could never bring honor.
In the end, they fled to tend their garden—
who could fathom the ways of the world?

**Tai Xiang’s Reclusion**
Tai Xiang plumbed the depths of emptiness,
his subtlety and remoteness beyond fathoming.
His endowment aligned with the Great Beginning,
his returned form dwelling in childhood’s guise.
Confucius briefly glimpsed the ultimate principle,
Yan Hui relied on true transmission.
Floating free like the myriad streams,
no trace of him could the world perceive.

**Taibo and Yanling**
Taibo perfected the ultimate yielding,
journeying far among the barbarian tribes.
Yanling carried on his lofty example,
leaving his state never to return.
Honor and glory weighed no more than a cicada’s wing,
while Dao and righteousness towered like mountains.
Their primal standard and towering integrity
remained unmatched through the ages.

**Huqiuzi**
Huqiuzi’s Dao was boundless,
its profound emptiness truly hard to know.
Ji Xian’s arts were shallow,
Liezi at first probed in doubt.
The perfected man forgets fortune and misfortune,
responding to change without fixed time.
The Great Vastness leaves no trace—
who can fathom the workings of the primal transformation?

**Duan Ganmu**
Ganmu, a man in coarse cloth,
guarded the Dao behind bolted gates.
His virtue shone, his righteousness and wealth secure—
how could he trade them for the honor of kings and lords?
The lord of Wei revered his worth,
his carriage leaning toward his hut in earnest respect.
Thus the Qin army did not advance,
and in his high repose, he became the state’s shield.

**Lu Zhonglian**
Zhonglian upheld rare integrity,
resolving crises while forsaking worldly ties.
A single word repelled the state of Qin,
a brief letter brought Liaocheng to submission.
Refusing gold, how far his righteousness reached;
declining rank, his heart grew ever clearer.
Having established his merit in the world,
with a flick of his sleeve, he strode into the azure waves.

**Yan Chu**
How lofty was Yan Chu,
his soaring spirit towering over Duke Xuan of Qi.
The Dao was revered, righteousness unbending—
a true scholar, he valued the king’s visit.
Honor and emolument could not tempt him,
preserving harmony by following nature.
He gave free rein to his passions,
bowing deeply to return to his mountain springs.

**Zhou Feng**
Zhou Feng prized reclusion’s splendor,
in stillness and silence revering namelessness.
The lord of Lu inquired of governance—
he expounded the essence of the ruling Dao.
The people of Hua were loyal and devoted,
yet suspicion arose from the covenant.
A single word conveyed the ultimate principle,
serving as a model for a thousand generations.

**Shi Jin**
The sage valued plainness and simplicity,
ritual and righteousness not the same as the profound Dao.
Shi Jin instructed Yan Hui—
truly he grasped the source of transformation.
The Master adorned his straw dogs,
and thus the natural Dao was exhausted.
Responding to things, he corrected his conduct,
in every movement and stillness, none was not fitting.

**Nanguo Zitu**
Zitu had long hidden his cunning,
in profound stillness, his heart turned to ashes.
Awakened, he journeyed with Yan,
his pure righteousness deep and boundless.
His voice contained all heaven’s sounds,
his words like the hub’s silent turning.
Right and wrong need not be debated—
why trouble the spirit with such cares?

**Master Qianlou**
Qianlou nurtured refined integrity,
guarding simplicity while forsaking worldly splendor.
Serene, he was ever content,
in harmony with things, utterly without flaw.
His wise wife matched his luminous virtue,
and even in death, she discerned right from wrong.
His refusal of the green robes was his true treasure,
his posthumous title truly worthy of praise.

**Yuan Xian**
How indifferent was Master Yuan,
contemplating the wondrous and delighting in his nature.
His thatched door was ever tranquil,
his zither songs rejoicing in heaven’s mandate.
True poverty lay in lacking wealth,
while having the Dao was no illness.
Mu Ci admired his lofty example,
though he himself retired amid carriages and horses.

**The Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang**
The world wearied of Qin’s virtue,
war and strife how chaotic and endless.
The Four Hoary Ones shared a life of non-action,
amid the hills, beyond the white clouds.
When Han founded its imperial enterprise,
they came once to aid the heir apparent.
Knowing the signs, they prized the Dao—
in reclusion, they became the dynasty’s pillars.

**The Old Man by the River**
Remote was the old man by the river,
nameless, attuned to emptiness and subtlety.
The numinous pass opened the profound purport,
a myriad chariots hastened to the Dao’s breeze.
Honor and disgrace could not entangle him,
floating free in the clouds’ void.
Alone he befriended creation—
who could fathom the boundless?

**Dongfang Shuo**
Dongfang embodied the Changes’ image,
mocking the world while hidden in court and temple.
His heart dwelled in pure subtlety,
his traces concealed, his brilliance veiled.
His dark vision lay in numerology,
his admonitions delivered in jest and laughter.
Selling medicine by the Five Lakes,
he returned to the Nine Immortals’ mysteries.

**Yan Junping**
The Han emperor sought the forgotten and reclusive,
and the many scholars were all at peace.

**Of Unshakable Virtue**
Unshakable was Yan Junping’s virtue,
alone he dwelled in profound obscurity.
Through divination he instructed the common folk,
his teachings unfolded the profound classics.
Closing his gate, he moved the primal signs—
why seek the purple courts of emperors?

**Sima Jizhu**
Jizhu transcended mortal bounds,
his hidden path lay in divination.
The two great ministers of Song and Jia
halted their carriages to witness his art.
With lofty discourse he mocked the court’s ranks,
his vast eloquence beyond all measure.
Yet ever he held the heart of phoenix and simurgh,
vanishing in silent retreat.

**Zheng Zizhen and Zhang Zhongwei**
Zizhen beneath the cliffs,
Zhongwei amid the brambles and weeds.
Though summoned with rites, they never bent,
content in poverty, ever at peace.
Their wills pure, they tilled the fields,
nurturing life through the mysteries of the void.
True joy lies not in external things—
the Dao’s obscurity holds boundless delight.

**Yan Ziling**
The Han emperor cherished his old friend,
seeking him through the land.
Thrice summoned from the deep marshes,
once he entered the imperial court.
In the Purple Chamber he shared the emperor’s bed,
a guest star verified in the celestial signs.
Yet rank and salary could not sway him—
he rejoiced in the clouds and mountains, tending his fields.

**Xiang Ziping**
Ziping loved true reclusion,
serene, he feasted on the *Laozi*.
Delving the profound, he delighted in non-action,
observing the signs to weigh gain and loss.
Ever he held a heart beyond the world,
though for a time he mingled with mortal affairs.
Once he completed his children’s marriages,
he departed forever to the Five Peaks.

**Han Kang**
Bohou harbored a distant heart,
his reclusion itself a thing of beauty.
Selling herbs without haggling,
fame brought him only deep shame.
How could he accept the imperial incense?
Ever he upheld his plain and simple vows.
Fleeing, he followed his aspirations,
vanishing like wind, leaving no dust behind.

**Tai Xiu and Guan Ning**
I praise Tai Xiaowei,
who found joy in the Dao, hidden in caves.
I esteem Guan You’an,
who nurtured truth and upheld lofty virtue.
Gathering herbs to sustain himself,
reading books as he pleased.
The world’s dust could not taint him—
his purity rivaled pine and snow.

**Gao Feng**
I observe the men of this age,
who twist their paths to chase renown.
Only Gao Wentong stood apart,
suing for his fields to shun false glory.
The imperial carriage summoned him in vain,
rank and salary never entangled his heart.
Hidden, he delighted in fishing—
the world’s net could not ensnare him.

**Pang Degong**
Pang Degong dwelled on Deer Gate,
cutting all ties with the city’s bustle.
Beyond the world’s dust he soared,
finding beauty in hills and valleys.
He tilled the soil with his own hands,
teaching his wife and children to hoe.
Preserving this, he knew no peril—
what were chariots and caps to him?

**Master Xuanyan**
Shi’an in his youth was aimless,
his spirit unpolished, his path unclear.
Then, moved by sudden resolve,
he studied day and night without rest.
His writings explored heaven and man,
declining summons, he guarded his silence.
His modest burial bore true frugality—
a model for generations to come.

**Sun Gonghe**
Sun Deng loved ancient simplicity,
clad in plant fibers, dwelling in caves.
His zither harmonized with heaven’s accord,
his *Book of Changes* revealed the primal signs.
All day his face held no anger,
serene in the mysteries of the void.
His parting words to Ruan Jiye—
where could his transcendent steps lead?

**Dong Weibei**
Dong Jing lodged by the White Society,
his hair unbound, chanting the Dao’s breeze.
His heart soared beyond the mortal realm,
his traces mingled in the city’s throng.
The world’s clamor could not defile him—
how could fame and rank confine him?
He concealed his shadow, left behind refined verses,
their subtlety truly unfathomable.

**Guo Wenju**
Guo, even as a child,
held a heart beyond the world.
Leaving all affairs behind,
he dwelled in truth amid the ancient forests.
In perfect harmony, he moved strange creatures—
fierce beasts cherished his virtuous voice.
To say he was without feeling would be wrong—
his words were faint yet profound.

**Tao the Eminent Lord**
I honor Tao Yuanming,
who understood life and knew contentment.
His joy lay in crouching with wine—
beyond that, he desired nothing.
Pengze was no glory to him,
bowing was truly a disgrace.
Returning to his north window,
he plucked chrysanthemums by the eastern hedge.
