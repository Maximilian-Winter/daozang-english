Collected by Zeng Can
**Chapter: Xuan Zhu (The Mysterious Axis)**

When the mind labors and the spirit wearies,
It strays far from the Dao.
When the mind is still and clear,
Then the Dao’s subtle beginnings emerge.

The *Zhi Pu Zi* (Master of Primordial Simplicity) said:
Is not the essence of Heaven its lofty luminosity?
Is not the nature of Heaven its profound emptiness?

Heaven bestows life upon me,
And I inherit it as my nature.
To wield it truly,
One must remain uncarved—
Neither cunning nor clumsy,
Neither wise nor foolish,
But serene, resting naturally
In the boundless field of spontaneity.

Once, the elder of Taoyuan Cave instructed the Master of Fangzhang:
“Alas!
Though you have entered the realm of *wuwei*,
Your nature still does not rest in stillness—
Why is this?”

**Chapter: Xuan Zhu (The Mysterious Axis) – Continued**

You delight in music—
The harmonies of *gong* and *shang* have ensnared you.
Is this not where your mind is ensnared?

Man, once stripped of his primordial simplicity, becomes adorned with artifice.
Things entice from without;
The five desires and six obfuscations mar his purity,
Leaving him unable to perceive the Heavenly Origin.
Thus, he must first purge his defilements.

How shall he purify himself?
My heart is like lawful water.
Then he washes away the *sanmei* (threefold delusion),
Opens the six obfuscations,
Removes the five defilements,
And filters out the turbid to reveal the pure.

To remain luminous and unstained,
One must first reject the perception of external things.
Thus, those who perceive subtleties from afar—
Their sharp insight is called the *axe that hews virtue*;
Those who pursue ornament and glory—
Their love of fame and gain is called the *abandonment of virtue*;
Those who speak with eloquence—
Their clever tongue is called the *poison that confuses virtue*;
Those who devise cunning schemes—
Their deep stratagems are called the *enemies that destroy virtue*.

Why is this?
The deeper the intelligence, the more deceit arises;
The farther the discernment, the more artifice prevails.
Those who confine me with knowledge
Are themselves the originators of knowledge;
Those who burden me with perception
Are themselves the originators of perception—
How could they be dazzled by externals?

Kang Bozi read ancient and modern texts,
Yet upon hearing the Dao, he remained all day as if foolish.
Pan Dong, seeing Zi Zhongli’s child, showed him objects but could not name them.
Zi Zhongli said:
“Great indeed is he who rejects perception!”
All things flourish in their variety,
Yet each returns to its root.
They unfold and bloom, then lose their true nature,
Born in the morning, perishing by evening—
Which of them does not decay?
I must turn inward and reflect.
I too am a thing.
Thus, I seek its source,
Gather its essence,
Abandon being to return to non-being,
And return to the True Void.

To return to the True Void,
One must first remove its ten provocations:
Adorned with fine words,
Confused by resounding sounds,
Indulged with rich foods,
Ensnared by fragrant scents,
Tempted by likes and dislikes,
Accustomed to jealousy and lust,
Enslaved by gold and jade,
Pleased by rank and wealth,
Charmed by flattery,
Deceived by schemes—
These are the ten provocations.
If they are not removed,
One will stray from virtue and lose the Dao.

Zhisongzi said:
“To remove them, one must first clarify their source.
The lowest of fools is dimly aware,
While the wisest may be obscured by evil and thus align with them.
How then shall one awaken from this dimness?
One must abandon the murky and enter the dwelling of pure clarity.”

The Most High said:
“Many know and see much,
Yet they take this as enlightenment—
This is true darkness.
Heaven bestows upon them their nature—
Why should it perish?
The Dao grants them its form—
Why should it wither?
When the seven emotions blaze within the five viscera,
The True Essence is consumed.
If one can extinguish these emotions,
Then in profound stillness, True Joy arrives.”

Shizhenzi studied but did not yet know the Dao,
And in desperation wept beneath the Jade Pool.
The True Lord said to him:
“If your seven emotions are not stirred by external contact,
You will enter True Wisdom.
If your inner heart is not yet pure,
You will still cling to ornamentation
And lose your purity.”

The ancient Perfect Ones
Rejected virtue with virtue,
Forgot form with form.
Virtue is mine—
Yet if I use virtue to obscure virtue, I fall into delusion;
Form is mine—
Yet if I use form to lose form, I fall into artifice.
Internally, I honor simplicity,
Like a withered tree.
Thus, excessive branches harm the trunk,
And elaborate adornments injure the root.

The *Fangong* (Palace of Perfection) is a sacred realm,
With eight divine precincts,
A thousand sacred halls—
The imperial capital.
My body too has its wondrous court,
Illuminated by the Wisdom Sun,
Fanned by the Mysterious Wind.
How then shall I attain it?
By restraining anger and suppressing desire,
By enduring what is gained,
By showing mercy without exclusion—
This is its beginning.

Miaosuzzi said:
“That which transcends form is called the Dao;
That which is beneath form is called the vessel.
The vessel is not virtue—
It is the vessel through which one enters the Dao.”

Alas!
The ceaseless, boundless flow—
This is the current of birth and death.
If I know that dust and toil corrupt the True and harm virtue,
I can sever it.

To converse with the Pine Pavilion and dismiss the white day,
To tune the Jade Zither and contend with the pure moon—
This is to dwell in the Dao.

External thoughts are the Dao’s enemy.
Dazzling colors confuse the mind,
Resounding sounds agitate the emotions.
The Ox of Earth drags them forth,
The Chariot of Heaven carries them away—
They rush outward and return inward,
And thus virtue is lost.

Virtue is like water;
If the wind disturbs it, its clarity is lost.
If I regard external things as mere dust,
I shall contain the Primordial and ascend to the Supreme One.

Jingsizzi said:
“Elaborate speech is a flaw in language;
Wicked glances are a flaw in perception;
Lewd sounds are a flaw in hearing;
Restlessness is a flaw in rectitude;
Familiarity is a flaw in judgment;
Madness is a flaw in thought.
Now, he who guides his *qi* and drifts in the boundless expanse—
Who dares neglect this?”

No greater fault exists than having perception,
Relying on discernment to open countless paths
And seeking victory.
Thus, intention can measure the emotions of the ancients,
And clarity can illuminate the principles of the sages.
Yet even so, there are obfuscations that cannot be opened,
Confusions that cannot be resolved.
To take divergent paths as the great road,
To mistake rushing waters as boundless darkness—
I take this as wisdom,
Yet the farther I stray from wisdom, the more distant I become.
It must be abandoned!

To transcend the sage and abandon intelligence,
To set aside innate knowledge,
And advance to the realm of *wuwei*—
This is the root of the Dao.

Gaolingzi had not yet heard the Dao,
Yet his books filled his home.
After hearing it, he burned his writings,
Blinded his sight,
And severed his perceptions.
The Dao is not nonexistent.
Virtue is not empty.
If it were nonexistent, one would sink into formless chaos;
If it were empty, one would abandon oneself to futile seeking.
Silent sounds are unheard,
Empty colors unseen,
Formless things unattained.

The utmost emptiness possesses its own void,
The true symbol possesses its own reality.
Thus, one must first firmly establish one’s steadfastness,
And only then enter the rectitude.

Not abandoning due to others,
Not shifting due to teachings—
This is the steadfast.

Decisively acting, resolutely entering,
Thus from being one attains to non-being,
From form one reaches stillness.

The Five Voids and Eight Consciousnesses,
Unrecognized from beginning to end,
Yet entering *wuwei*—
Perhaps they do not yet know that *wuwei* is inherently possessed!

To establish the self,
One must first abandon the self.

Lost in dusty confusion,
Obscured by material veils,
Clinging to the self—
This harms the Dao.

Thus, forgetting self and object as one,
And annihilating even that oneness to enter the realm of non-being—
Open and penetrating,
Wise and unobstructed,
Formless in body,
Thoughtless in mind.

The innate nature, when followed,
Cannot be seized by things,
Cannot be stolen by the external.

Heaven grants form to all things;
The Dao grants nature to all things.
Flowing form departs far from the court of nature—
Who does not have steadfastness?

There are those who guard the small and lose the great,
Who guard the external and abandon the internal,
Who guard the other and lose the self,
Who guard the false and betray the true.
Is there a way to guard?

To guard the self with greatness,
To fortify the inner with truth.
If one does not know how to guard,
When the innate and pure arrive,
Who can repel them?

Yuánxùzi said:
“Is it guarding the dark with whiteness?”

Tàishàng said to Fànzi:
“The Five Corruptions are gone,
The Seven Emotions are extinguished—
Do you know this?”

Fànzi said:
“Is it through refining and polishing?”

He replied:
“Without refining to guard, the external will shift;
Without polishing to guard, the possessed will topple—
Only guarding the self suffices.”

Zhuānméng’s son was not inherently different in nature,
Only he was deluded and unaware.
Once awakened,
His spirit settled, his soul steadied,
And he entered the subtle.

Huángfǔzi said:
Awakening has five paths:
Some awaken from calamity,
Some from illness,
Some from hardship,
Some from ignorance,
Some from enlightenment.

Once the streams divide, their source scatters;
Once the emotions arise, nature is obscured.
Thus, if the source is not clarified,
The Six Desires pollute it,
The Three Poisons disrupt it.

Obscuring the source—this is the streams;
Disturbing nature—this is the emotions.
Lustful desires are turbulent waves.
Frivolous pursuits and chasing desires give rise to impurity,
While purity and reality perish in things—
The essence of nature withers and loses its simplicity,
The luminous soul is stained and grows dim;
The roots unsettled, the stem unsteady.

Immersed in a single vision,
Solely guarding the source—
The streams then shine clear and pure.

My innate nature originates the same as others,
Received in purity without blemish,
Preserved in refinement without strife.
Within lies the round—
This is nature.

Flowing without exhaustion,
Merging without congealing.
Exhaustion leads to obscurity,
Congealing leads to stagnation.
Those who are bright and penetrating,
Refined and internally robust,
Harmonious and externally complete—
Radiant as boundless spring,
Divine yet undispersed.
Their yang does not cling to things—
This is the effect of the round!

Thus, obtaining nature,
Quieting it to stillness while unaware of its movement,
Emptying it to its utmost while unaware of its return—
Is this not like the solitary yin’s stillness,
Yet not entering its truth?

Yùhuìzi said:
“When the Six Desires arise, the true spirit is diminished—
How could it remain round?
When the Three Poisons flourish, the harmonious balance is lost—
How could it remain fused?
Roundness and fusion collapse—
The gate to premature death is near.

Things’ natures are never inherently different,
Great and small are confined alike,
Likes and dislikes are received equally.
Following their greatness and smallness,
Their likes and dislikes—
One loses the root,
Drifts from the origin,
Abandons the source,
Loses the ancestor.

Seizing one’s nature,
Startled by the Six Dusts,
Abandoning the Three Pangs—
Only piercing the delusion,
Splitting the stupidity,
Taking clarity as the origin,
Taking purity as nature,
Recognizing the confines of yin and yang,
And aligning with the boundless, void, primordial nature—
This is the ultimate path.

Xiāozhuìzi said:
“Obtaining the One and clarifying—
Rising above the multitude of rulers,
Playing with transformation,
Contracting with nature—
This is the return to the utmost truth.”

Chénglízī said:
“The Three Clarities dwell within,
The Six Orifices are sealed without—
I do not ascend to divergent paths.

Wūxiá’s son took resonance as his doctrine and gained ghostly attendance,
Xībō’s son sought his ancestor through means and received the perverse reply—
What one perceives must be approached with caution!

Within the lawless lies a standard,
Within the boundless lies a constraint.
Voidness governs with the Dao,
Emptiness transforms the confines.
This void is not the void they speak of,
This emptiness is not the emptiness they speak of.
Not voiding thought,
Not thinking of voidness—
This may be called penetration.

To draw water with a basket—
Is this not seeking from the void?

I know how to supplement it,
Thus restoring true nature.

If one sincerely takes non-being as non-being,
How can one speak of the Dao’s greatness?

True cultivation responds like the green shoots—
No entering, no abandoning,
While the luminous heart manifests externally.
Thus, the true purity stands erect,
The profound principles are uniquely attained,
Heaven’s purity is unblemished,
And one enters wisdom.

Zhōnglízi said:
When insight is luminous, its name is wisdom;
When the spirit is full and steadfast, its name is roundness.

Those who attain stillness
Are those who lose stillness.
How excellent their forgetting!
To the utmost depth, the utmost void—
One may ascend to loss.

Their mind is like stagnant ore—
Things cannot entice them,
Thus entering darkness without obscurity,
Entering vagueness without confusion.

The boundless reveals itself in sight,
The silent in sound.
Not-seeing is true seeing,
Not-hearing is true hearing—
Then seeing and hearing are truly realized.

I have never been obscured;
I have entered the profound void,
Guarded the boundless emptiness,
Within stillness attaining the response of stillness.

Above the Nine Transformations, it is nameless;
Before the Four Wanderings, it is formless.
To return to this—only the Void suffices.

To take having as having is the error of excess;
To take non-being as non-being is the error of emptiness.
The having of non-being—true having;
The non-being of non-being—true non-being.

The depths of stillness, stillness again and again;
The depths of the Mysterious Void, the Void again and again.
This is but its coarse manifestation.

To perceive the non-being of non-being—
This is to attain the Dao,
The origin of the Supreme Primordial!

Zhōnglízi said:
Within the Void to seek the Void—
Who can know it?

The premature and impure are marred by mixture;
The vital source, when turbid, is obstructed.
Only the vast, like a valley, receives without retaining;
Only the serene, like the sea, flows without ceasing.

Do not deceive the Dao,
Do not harm its nature.
Vastly preserve its truth,
Silently inherit its qi.
Spirit and essence harmonize—
Perfected in unchanging transformation.

How do we know this?
The real is the response of the void;
The void is the foundation of the real.
They serve each other,
Returning to their origin—
Their transformations unfathomable.

The Mysterious Observer can purify our nature,
But thought without emptiness risks excessive knowledge,
And emptiness without thought risks aimless drift.
Is this not the path to understanding life’s essence?

This is the Dao—the complete and ultimate nature of the Dao.

**The Five Transformations**
All things teem and change without end;
Through the Dao’s transformation, emptiness and clarity flow freely.

Tánzǐ said:
The Dao has Five Transformations.
What are the Dao’s transformations?
The Void transforms into Spirit,
Spirit into Qi,
Qi into Form,
Form generates all things—
This is the Dao’s essence.

Form transforms into Qi,
Qi into Spirit,
Spirit into Void,
Void and clarity unite—
This is the Dao’s function.

The Sage exhausts the extremes of openness and closure,
Attains the source of transformation,
Forgets form to nourish Qi,
Forgets Qi to nourish Spirit,
Forgets Spirit to nourish the Void.
Void and reality interpenetrate—
This is called Great Unity.

Its essence is the Primordial Refined,
Its function is the Ten Thousand Spirits,
Its retreat is the Supreme Unity,
Its release is the Supreme Clarity.

The old maple transforms into a feathered being,
The rotting wheat into a butterfly—
From lifeless to living;
The virtuous woman into solid stone,
The mountain worm into a lily—
From living to lifeless.

The archer who resembles a tiger
Sees the tiger but not the stone;
The executioner of the violent dragon
Sees the dragon but not the water.

Thus all things can be made void,
The self can be made nonexistent.
By uniting my nonexistence with their void,
Naturally I can hide, can manifest,
Can die, can live.
Dust in the air—
Like flying clouds, unseen by the eye;
Ants in the depths—
Like thunder, unheard by the ear.

The corpse is not seen or heard!

The Supreme Void is one Void;
The Supreme Spirit is one Spirit;
The Supreme Qi is one Qi;
The Supreme Form is one Form.

Command it, and it is one;
Root it, and it is one.
To hold it is not to possess,
To abandon it is not to lose—
This is called the Rectification of Unity.

The infant plays with shadows,
Unknowing it is played by shadows;
The madman mocks images,
Unknowing it is mocked by images.

The family transforms—
Unknowing it is transformed by the family;
The nation transforms—
Unknowing it is transformed by the nation;
The world transforms—
Unknowing it is transformed by the world.

The Void transforms into Spirit,
Spirit into Qi,
Qi into blood,
Blood into Form,
Form into the fetus,
The fetus into the infant,
The infant into the child,
The child into the youth,
The youth into the adult,
The adult into the aged,
The aged into death,
Death transforms back into the Void,
The Void transforms back into Spirit,
Spirit transforms back into Qi,
Qi transforms back into things.

Ah!
The transformations are boundless!

The **Supreme Daoist** is the **God of Emptiness and Nonbeing**; the **Heaven and Earth** are the **Gods of Yin and Yang**; **Humans and insects** are the **Gods of Blood and Flesh**. Their common essence is **Spirit**; their differing manifestations are **Form**.

Form is not responsive, yet **Qi** is;
Words are not responsive, yet **Sound** is;
Awareness is not responsive, yet **Dreams** are;
Life is not responsive, yet **Death** is.

Ice floats and returns to clarity,
Form scatters and returns to luminosity—
He who knows **True Death**,
May then wander the **Supreme Daoist’s** capital.

Who embodies the **Transformation of Guarding**?
The **Cloud Dragon, Wind Tiger**—
Those who grasp the **Dao of Spirit and Qi**.

Spirit is the **Mother**; **Qi** is the **Child**.
To summon **Qi** with **Spirit**,
To call the **Child** with the **Mother**—
What cannot be attained?

The **Purification of Filth** must summon the **Qi of the Five Directions**;
The **Subjugation of the Python** must harness the **Essence of the Five Stars**.

Summon it from without, hold it within,
Deploy it from without—
Nothing is beyond reach.

To turn a **ten-thousand-hu** vessel,
One must plant a **one-ren** wood;
To loose a **thousand-jin** crossbow,
One must trigger a **one-cun** mechanism.

The eyes can survey **Heaven and Earth**,
A single person can rule **ten-thousand households**.

The **Great Void** is vast yet bounded,
The **Supreme Daoist** is boundless yet has a **home**.

To grasp **Heaven and Earth’s** principles,
To know **Yin and Yang’s** lodgings,
To perceive **Spirit’s** repositories—
Then **numbers can be reversed**, **fate can be governed**, and **Heaven and Earth can be turned back**.

The **Most licentious** transform into **women**,
The **Most brutal** transform into **tigers**.

The **joyful**—their **Form** is harmonious;
The **delighted**—their **Form** is relaxed;
The **wrathful**—their **Form** is rigid;
The **grieved**—their **Form** is contracted—
This too is the **Dao of Transformation**.

The **worm of the field** bears the **child of the cicada**,
Transmitting their **emotions**, mingling their **essences**,
Moistening their **Qi**, blending their **Spirits**,
According to size, all attain their **truth**.

**Unresponsive movement** lacks fixed **emotion**,
**Unresponsive Form** lacks fixed **shape**—
When **Yin and Yang** clash, **mushrooms and fungi** sprout without roots,
When **dryness and moisture** interact, **oysters and clams** rise without mothers.

The human **roots** **Yin and Yang** and **nurtures** them,
The human **imitates** dryness and moisture—
Nothing fails; why?
The **Noble One** studies **things** to know the **body**,
Studies the **body** to grasp the **Dao**.

**Gully pines** can defy frost,
Because they **harbor** **correct Qi**;
**Fine jade** can withstand fire,
Because it **accumulates** **pure Essence**.

The **Great Sage** wields the **Spirit Banner** by day,
Records the **Divine Herb** by night—
Awakening to thoughts beyond ordinary,
He can **ward off winter winds** without chill,
**Resist summer flames** without heat.

Who embodies **Virtue’s Transformation**?

The **wise** are often **humiliated**,
The **eloquent** often **insulted**,
The **illuminated** often **obscured**,
The **brave** often **slain**.

The **Noble One** can blame himself and thus blame others,
Can refrain from **vengeance** and thus **vengeance** others.
To **save** and claim **righteousness**—
Others will call him **unrighteous**.
To **act benevolently** and seek **reward**—
Others will call him **unrewarded**.

Even **ants** have their **lords**—
A **fist-sized palace** for all to dwell,
A **one-block platform** for all to stand,
A **single grain of food** for all to store,
A **single insect’s flesh** for all to **consume**.

Thus, **heart** must first **communicate** before **Spirit** can,
**Spirit** must first **communicate** before **Qi** can,
**Qi** must first **communicate** before **Form** can—
The **Dao of the Great Ancients**.

Who embodies **Nourishment’s Transformation**?

One day without food brings **weariness**,
Two days without food brings **illness**,
Three days without food brings **death**.

**Nourishment** is the most urgent of human affairs.

Those who **practice divination** will surely be **attached by ghosts**,
Those who **erect images** will surely be **dominated by spirits**.

**Music** is what **joy** is meant to **enjoy**.

The tiger and wolf consume flesh no more than their nature demands,
The dragon and serpent crave blood no more than their instincts decree—
Yet humans lust for all things without restraint,
And thus, when desires are unfulfilled, strife ensues.

When water presses, one casts oneself into the depths,
Knowing escape is impossible, yet hoping for reprieve’s delay.
When the tiger’s jaws open, one hurls oneself into the ravine,
Knowing death is certain, yet clinging to the faintest chance of life.

Who then is shaped by **frugality**?

Water and fire are tools of daily use—
When wielded without **proper method**, they ruin households,
For they lack **simplicity**.
Food and drink are staples of sustenance—
When consumed without **proper measure**, they destroy the body,
For they lack **moderation**.

To guard against ruin, nothing surpasses **frugality**.
Frugality in hearing **nurtures emptiness**,
Frugality in sight **nurtures spirit**,
Frugality in speech **nurtures qi**,
Frugality in private matters **nurtures wealth**,
Frugality in public affairs **nurtures nobility**,
Frugality in gates and doors **wards off thieves and bandits**,
Frugality in defense and protection **prevents rebellion**,
Frugality in consorts and concubines **extends lifespan**,
Frugality in the heart **commands life and death**—
This is called the **pivot of all transformations**.

The extravagant, though rich, are never satisfied,
The frugal, though poor, always have enough.
The extravagant’s heart is ever impoverished,
The frugal’s heart is ever enriched.

The extravagant clings to kin, and thus accumulates faults,
The frugal keeps distance, and thus commits few errors.
The extravagant serves their lord and invites disgrace,
The frugal serves their lord and secures their post.

The extravagant are plagued by worries,
The frugal abound in joy.
The extravagant crave action,
The frugal cherish stillness.
The extravagant seek the difficult,
The frugal embrace the simple.
The extravagant indulge in ease and pleasure,
The frugal savor tranquility and plainness.

Some live a lifetime with a single vessel, never broken,
Others wear a single robe for ten years, never worn out—
Such are the ones who may now **enter the Dao of Purity and Stillness**.

*End of Volume One of the Dao Gun Scroll.*

**Volume Two of the Dao Gun Scroll**

**Chapter One: The Essentials of Nourishing Life in Supreme Purity (上篇太清养生, 下篇太清养生)**

**The Second Volume of the Dao Gun Scroll**
*Collected by Zeng Xi, Master of the Wandering Dao*

**The Upper Scroll of *Zhuangzi’s* "Forgetting the Self" (坐忘篇上)**

The *Treasure Scripture* stands firm—its three compilations preserved.
I grasp its essence, attaining harmony with the True through serene contemplation.

The heart is the sovereign of the body, the general of the spirit.
When still, it generates wisdom;
when agitated, it breeds confusion.

At the outset of Daoist practice, one must gather the heart and depart from the world,
entering emptiness to unite with the Way.

Yet to cling to the heart while dwelling in emptiness is not true non-attachment.
To dwell in attachment exhausts the heart and depletes the *qi*, giving rise to illness.

When one hears praise or blame, good or evil, and receives them with the heart,
the heart becomes full—fullness blocks the Way’s abode.

To hear as though not hearing,
to see as though not seeing—
praise, blame, good, and evil do not enter the heart.
This is called *Empty Heart*.

Empty, the heart finds peace;
peaceful, the Way comes naturally.

The heart is like the eye:
the slightest intrusion disturbs it, leaving no tranquility.

Cattle and horses, though domesticated, if unleashed, become fierce and unmanageable;
eagles and wild birds, once snared, naturally grow tame.

So too is my heart.

Yet the marvel of the method lies in practice, not mere words.
To remain unstained by things, to act without confusion—
this is the subtlety of the Great Dao!

Some say the Dao is difficult to attain,
but they do not know that brocade begins with plain silk,
that cranes soaring to the heavens first feed on grains,
that trees blocking the sun begin as saplings.

Overreaching exhausts wisdom and strength;
excessive striving harms body and spirit.

To hurl a pearl like the Duke of Sui’s at a thousand-*ren* sparrow—
even men laugh at such folly.
Yet some abandon virtue and nature,
neglecting their essence while boasting of their own worth.

What disrupts the body are bandits and thieves.
If I can govern them with a steadfast heart, I am a valiant warrior;
if I observe with wisdom, I wield a sharp blade;
if I cast off external burdens, I achieve victory;
if I dwell in constant joy, I secure honor and blessings.

If I do not act thus, I am like one fleeing battle, abandoning armor—
only to invite blame.

Thus, steadiness is the foundation for attaining the Dao,
the culmination of cultivating stillness,
the completion of maintaining peace.

*Zhuangzi* said: *"The boundless expanse finds order in the radiance of Heaven."*
What does this mean?

*The boundless* is the heart;
*Heaven’s radiance* is wisdom.
When emptiness and stillness reach their peak,
the Dao resides within, and wisdom arises.

Wisdom is our original nature.
Through greed and delusion, we are scattered and confused, unaware—
but if we purify ourselves, we return to pristine stillness.

The spirit’s nature is empty and fluid,
harmonizing with Heaven, responding to change.
When form aligns with the Dao, there is no birth or death.
In seclusion, form merges with the spirit;
in manifestation, the spirit blends with *qi*.
Thus, one may tread fire and water without harm,
face the sun and moon without casting a shadow.
Life and death depend on oneself;
entry and exit are without question.

Yet the Dao of emptiness has depths and shallows:
probing reveals its influence over form,
superficially, it affects only the heart.
What influences form is the spirit;
what touches the heart is wisdom and awareness.
Wisdom and awareness prevent the body from decaying—
why? Because wisdom is the heart’s illumination;
excessive use exhausts its essence.

At first, wisdom brings delight and eloquence,
but this dissipates the spirit, leading to *shixie* dissolution.

Thus, the sage contains light and conceals brilliance,
condenses the spirit to return to substance.
When spirit and Dao unite,
when body and heart align with the Dao,
then the six senses become transparent.

The body exists without ceasing;
the heart communicates without obstruction.

Thus it is said:
When mountains hold jade, grasses and trees do not wither;
when a person embraces the Dao, their form endures forever.

Here lies its subtlety—the pivot of *Zhuangzi’s* "Forgetting the Self."

Those who refine the Dao to attain Truth must first abandon perverse conduct.
External affairs must not disturb the heart.
Seated in stillness, inwardly observing—
when thoughts arise, extinguish them.
Though only the restless heart is extinguished, not the illuminating heart,
only the empty heart is concentrated, not the attached heart.

To practice this, one must receive three precepts:
First, *simplify and discard*—selecting the essential and eliminating excess.
The *Classic* says: *"Few things bring attainment; many bring confusion."*

Second, *renounce desire*—cutting off greed.
The *Classic* says: *"Constantly without desire, one may perceive its marvel."*

Third, *still the heart*—halting its wandering.
The *Classic* says: *"Remove filth, cease thoughts, still the heart, and hold to One—
is this not what is meant?"*

Thus, with an empty heart and no desires,
the Dao is not sought—it comes naturally.

Its essence lies in this:
Amidst affairs and noise, one must intentionally cultivate peace.
Whether occupied or idle, always appear as though without concern;
in stillness or tumult, let the will remain singular.

Binding the heart too tightly brings illness and madness;
if the heart does not move, let it rest naturally,
adjusting tension and ease as needed—
self-regulating without fixation,
releasing yet unmoving—this is true steadiness.

Yet even thus, one must not cling to steadiness
while seeking many affairs or embracing noise.
Instead, like a still mirror reflecting forms,
one must adapt to each thing before responding.

To seek wisdom within steadiness harms steadiness;
steadiness without seeking wisdom naturally generates wisdom.
The attained Daoist’s heart has five phases,
the body seven signs—
these mark the shallow and the deep.

What are the five phases?
When movement predominates and stillness is scarce—this is the first;
when movement and stillness are equal—this is the second;
when stillness predominates and movement is scarce—this is the third;
when stillness prevails in inaction but stirs upon contact—this is the fourth;

To merge with the Dao in silent unity,
and yet remain unmoved even upon contact—this is the fifth.

What are the seven signs?
When actions align with the seasons and demeanor is harmonious—this is the first;
when old ailments vanish and body-mind feels light and refreshed—this is the second;
when one restores youthful vitality and reclaims one’s lifespan—this is the third;
when lifespan extends to ten thousand years, and one is called an *xian*—this is the fourth;
when form is refined into *qi*, and one is called a *zhenren*—this is the fifth;
when *qi* is transmuted into spirit, and one is called a *shenren*—this is the sixth;
when spirit is refined into the Dao, and one is called a *zhiren*—this is the seventh.

In the *"Zuo Wang"* chapter, Tian Yinzi says:
When a person is born, they inherit *lingqi*—
clear and perceptive, learning without obstruction—
this is called *shen* (spirit).

To dwell *shen* within and extend its radiance outward—
this is called *xian* (transcendence).

*Lingqi* must not be sullied by the vulgar world—
only then can it be preserved.

Joy, anger, grief, delight, love, desire, and hatred—
these seven are the perversions of *emotion*.

Wind, cold, heat, dampness, hunger, satiety, labor, and ease—
these eight are the perversions of *qi*.

To abandon these perversions brings one closer to *xian*.

Simplicity is the Dao of Heaven and Earth.
Heaven is above my head;
Earth is beneath my feet.
I perceive them—
thus, simplicity is the virtue of the *shenxian*.

Those who study the Dao
speak in lofty mystification and cling to delusion,
seeking no foundation—this is not my teaching.

Thus, those who study *qi* may be harmed by *qi* itself;
those who study *xian* may be ensnared by *xian* itself.

Yet those who study the Dao must progress gradually—
there are five gates:
First, *zhai jie* (ritual purity);
Second, *an chu* (tranquil dwelling);
Third, *cun xiang* (meditative visualization);

Fourth, *zuò wàng* (sitting in oblivion);
Fifth, *shén jiě* (spiritual comprehension).

**Ritual purity (*zhāi jiè*)**, why is it so? It is to cleanse the body and empty the heart. *Zhāi* means purity and tranquility; *jiè* means moderation and restraint. When hungry, eat; when eating, do not overindulge—this is called *tiáo zhōng* (harmonizing moderation). Do not eat what is unripe; do not eat what is rotten or obstructs the *qi*; do not eat too much of the five flavors. Do not sit too long, do not stand too long, do not labor too long, do not rest too long. Constantly rub the left and right hands until they are warm, then smooth the skin to dispel cold *qi*—this is called *chàng wài* (unblocking the exterior). Thus, when the body is firm, the *qi* will arrive.

**Tranquil dwelling (*ān chǔ*)**, why is it so?
Face south while seated, bind the head while sleeping. The dwelling must be in a house or hut where *yin* and *yang* are balanced. If it is too high, *yang* will be excessive and light will be abundant, which harms the *pò* (vital breath), for the *pò* is *yin*. If it is too low, *yin* will be excessive and darkness will be abundant, which harms the *hún* (ethereal soul), for the *hún* is *yang*. If there is harm, then illness will arise. Moreover, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth—if there is the cutting *yang* of the primordial breath or the invasive *yin* of licentiousness, how could one not be cautious? Therefore, my dwelling has windows on all four sides: when the wind rises, close them; when the wind ceases, open them. The front must have curtains, the rear must have screens. If it is too bright, hang curtains to soften the internal reflections; if it is too dark, roll up the curtains to allow the external light to pass through. Internally, to tranquilize my heart; externally, to tranquilize my eyes. When heart and eyes are tranquil, then the body is tranquil. Thus, those who indulge in emotions and excessive thoughts cannot tranquilize their inner and outer selves—this is clear.

**Meditative visualization (*cún xiǎng*)**, why is it so? *Cún* means to preserve my spirit; *xiǎng* means to visualize my body. How can one achieve this? Close the eyes and you will see your own eyes; gather the heart and you will see your own heart. When heart and eyes do not stray from the body, they will not harm the spirit—this is the gradual process. Ordinary people spend the whole day looking at others, and their hearts wander outward; spend the whole day engaging with external affairs, and their eyes gaze outward. Their minds are scattered and their vision superficial; never do they return inward. How could they not fall ill and die young? Therefore, *returning to the root* means daily stillness; daily stillness means *recovering the vital breath*; recovering the vital breath perfects the nature—this is the gateway to all mysteries.

**Sitting in oblivion (*zuò wàng*)**, why is it so? It arises from meditative visualization and is achieved through forgetting meditative visualization. *Practicing the Dao* without seeing its practice—is this not the meaning of *sitting*? Seeing without practicing what is seen—is this not the meaning of *oblivion*? Not practicing means the heart does not move; not seeing means the form is extinguished. Some say, "The unmoving heart—is there a Dao in this?" Heaven conceals itself, and the adept remains silent, not answering. Some say, "The extinguished form—is there a Dao in this?" Heaven conceals itself, and the adept is blind, not seeing. Some enlighten themselves and say, "The Dao is within me."

**Spiritual comprehension (*shén jiě*)**, why is it so?
Ritual purity (*zhāi jiè*) is *faithful comprehension*, for without faithfulness, one cannot comprehend.
Tranquil dwelling (*ān chǔ*) is *tranquil comprehension*, for without a tranquil heart, one cannot comprehend.
Meditative visualization (*cún xiǎng*) is *leisurely comprehension*, for without a leisurely heart, one cannot comprehend.
Sitting in oblivion (*zuò wàng*) is *wise comprehension*, for without wisdom, one cannot comprehend.
When these four are harmonized with the spirit, then one attains *spiritual comprehension*.

The spirit—when it encompasses the Three Realms (*sān cái*), it is called *Yì* (Ease/Change);
when it aligns with all things, it is called *Dào* (Dao/Way);
when it returns to its original nature, it is called *Zhēn Yī* (True Unity).
The Heaven-concealing adept says:
"Born within *Yì*, dying within *Yì*, moving with all things, tranquil with all things—
is this not the Dao?
The perverse arises from one nature, the true arises from one nature—
I comprehend all with spiritual comprehension.
Whether in man, in earth, or in water,
all may become *xian*.
Transforming and harmonizing it—this is called *shénxiān* (spirit-adept).

The Master of True Unity (*Zhèng Yī Xiānshēng*), upon reading this text, awoke and said, "I differ." Thus, my simplicity and ease are *wu wéi* (non-action) yet without failing to act. My gradual process is to guard the nature and rectify the vital breath, day by day—this is the Dao of gradual progress. The practices akin to ritual purity may also be cultivated together.

In the continuation below, the wandering adept says:
"I have obtained the theory of sitting in oblivion in three treatises, none better than this?"

The Master of True Unity, Sīmǎ Zǐ Wēi, says:
"I recently saw the Daoist scholar Zhào Jiān compose a seven-part treatise on sitting in oblivion. Its scope is broad, its text elaborate, its intent simple, its words persuasive. Those who read it ponder its chapters and memorize its order—this may be called *zuò chí* (sitting while distracted), not what I call sitting in oblivion.

I heard from my teacher that sitting in oblivion is the foundation of longevity. Therefore, to attract the True and refine the form, when the form is clear, it merges with the *qi*; to contain the Dao and refine the *qi*, when the *qi* is clear, it merges with the spirit. When the body aligns with the Dao in profound unity, this is called attaining the Dao.

The True is the origin of the Dao, so to purify the spirit is to grasp the True.
Zhuāngzi says: *Yǔ tài dìng fā hū tiān guāng* (The vast and tranquil harmonizes with the radiance of Heaven).
*Yǔ* is the heart; *tiān guāng* is the illumination of wisdom.
First tranquilize the heart, then the illumination of wisdom arises within.
It shines upon all realms, yet empty and forgotten—
the heart merges into stillness—this is called sitting in oblivion.

Lǎozi says: *Jí wú wú shēn, wú yǒu hé huàn?* (When I have no body, what harm can I suffer?)
To have no body is not to lack this body—
it is to merge the body with the Great Dao,
not to pursue honor or nobility,
nor to seek advancement through means.
It is to be naturally without desire,
forgetting this body of attachments—
this is called sitting in oblivion.

Longevity means the spirit and form are both preserved.
Therefore, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth—
when the *qi* of Heaven and Earth is exhausted, there is no way to see the Dao.
The form and vessel are the abode of nature—
when they decay, nature has no place to reside.
To nurture the spirit without nurturing the form
is like destroying one’s home and dwelling in the open—
how could it not be so?

Some say: "When a person’s lifespan comes to an end, if the heart and mind are upright, then the spirit ascends to the realm of True."
The Master of True Unity says: "This is not the speech of the utmost rectitude.
The virtuous adept, though claiming to forget self and other,
and to extinguish right and wrong,
still frowns at what is unvirtuous and smiles at what is virtuous—
still, they are deceived by virtue and vice."

The final breath arrives, and confusion and dimming senses follow—
I have never seen one who is not seduced by myriad evils.

Thus, there are those whose *consciousness* transforms into *unconsciousness*—
like the Qin woman’s metamorphosis into stone;
there are those whose *human consciousness* transforms into *insect-like consciousness*—
like Master Huang’s transmutation into electricity?

From this, it is clear:
the heart and mind are shaped by yin and yang—
how could they remain steadfast on their own?

Hence, the value of preserving *form* and *spirit* intact—
this is the very reason.

Now, some know that honor and wealth are empty illusions,
and understand that birth and death are but one thread—
yet when death approaches,
they still seek physicians and pray to spirits—
why is this?

They do not yet grasp the *sitting-forgetting* method.

*Forgetting* means to forget all realms—
first, they must *realize* the void,
then all illusions follow,
and only then can the heart be settled.

Above settled heart, there is a sudden clarity—
no *covering* remains;
below settled heart, there is emptiness—
no *foundation* exists.

Though touched and unmoved, *wisdom* may yet arise—
still, it is not free from yin and yang’s shaping,
until they rely on the *elixir of immortality* to ascend,
entering the formless,
emerging beyond the realm of transformation,
only then can yin and yang be mastered by me.

#1 *End of Volume Two of Dao Gunzhu*, with the essential text revised to read: **"then."**
*Volume Twenty-Eight: Upper and Lower Chapters on Nourishing Life in Supreme Clarity*
*Volume Twenty-Eight: Nourishing Life in Supreme Clarity (Lower Chapter)*
*Volume Three of Dao Gunzhu*

The *Essential Gathering* by Master Zeng Can of the Wandering Daoist:

The ancient sages of old spoke in abundance like a forest;
Through the Dao’s vast observation, one may probe its depths.

Master Chao Wenyuan said:
*"Beholding this floating world—
Is it not the realm of birth, old age, sickness, and death?
Is it not the den of sorrow, grief, and torment?"*

Only those with settled clarity perceive:
Within, their body and mind are empty;
Without, all things are empty.
Thus, when all forms are shattered,
There is nothing to grasp, nothing to contest.

All that exists is but a dream’s illusion.
Within dreams, men consort with phantoms,
Yet they say, *"Striking in a dream cannot harm!"*
Is this not knowing dream within dream?

I once sat in the Jade Hall,
Watching a laborer draw water.
Observing the void’s ripeness,
No whole man remains—
Only a block of emptiness,
From west to east.
Is this not knowing illusion within illusion?

Thus, when nothing exists,
Views arise in their diversity.
The Daoist must first still the mind.

When thoughts arise, they are known—
Like a river’s flow, a scoop of earth may dam it,
And the surging tide may be halted.
Like wildfire, a cup of water may quench it,
And the blazing spread may be extinguished.

Yet fear not thoughts arising—
Only fear delayed awareness.
Swift awareness, swift stillness—
This is the Dao’s subtle art.

I have said:
Breath and mind are interdependent;
When breath is regulated, the mind is tranquil.
When thoughts arise, awaken—
Awaken, and they vanish—
This is the Dao’s supreme vehicle.

Master Pei Xiu said:
Earth, water, fire, and wind—
Artificial combinations, gathering and dispersing—
Not my body.
Green thoughts, dusty illusions—
Empty fantasies, flickering and fading—
Not my mind.

I possess a true body—
Perfect, empty, and serene.
I possess a true mind—
Vast, luminous, and harmonious.

Though myriad illusions arise and are shattered,
Water’s nature never truly ceases to exist;
Though a thousand lamps burn and are extinguished,
Fire’s nature never truly vanishes.

Do the world’s people know these three symbols?
When *qi* moves and clarifies—
This is Heaven’s symbol.
When the mind is still and tranquil—
This is Earth’s symbol.
When wisdom is rounded and luminous—
This is the Sun and Moon’s symbol.

When these three harmonize,
Then naturally my divine and wondrous functions appear.

With the three symbols understood,
The six self-examinations must not be neglected.

Test yourself thus:
Are delusive thoughts stilled?
Are external distractions dispelled?
When confronted with all things, am I unmoved?
Are black and white without distinction?
Are dream-thoughts not inverted?
Is the heart’s chamber at ease?

Thus one may measure the depth and shallowness of attaining the Dao.

I have often admonished myself:
*"To know the arising and passing of thoughts is to cut the root of birth and death.
No longer following the turning of delusion—
This is called the Unmoved Noble One."*

If one cannot yet be without thoughts, then practice observing emptiness;
If one cannot suddenly attain emptiness, then practice counteracting [the mind].
These three strategies are applied in sequence.

Zhuangzi’s *sitting-forgetting*, Bodhidharma’s *wall-gazing*—
The beginner cannot comprehend them,
Yet they fall into reckless abandon—
Is this their true intent?

I once sat upright, contemplating the *suchness* of reality,
And saw a demon king’s image pressing upon my foot—
I was terrified.
Is this the way of one who sits unmoved in the Dao?

The *Spattered Gold Scripture*, the *Forgotten Garden’s* profundity,
Zhu Qian’s emptiness—
All harmonize in rectifying the heart,
And share the same function as Confucianism.

Master Chao Wenyuan said:
*"Is there truly any difference in teaching?"*
I have unified the Three Ways into one.

The Confucian tradition holds that rectifying one’s conduct is most urgent—
Do not seek its fruits, and the fruits will naturally manifest.
Zhu Qian’s school holds that restoring one’s true nature is most urgent—
Do not seek its verification, and the verification will naturally be known.

When I first read *Nanhua* [Zhuangzi],
I grasped the principle of *equalizing all things* and attained a method,
Which I named the *Free-and-Easy Great Harmony Observation*—
And found nothing to dispute.

Later, when I read the Western [Buddhist] texts,
I grasped the principle of *no-self* and attained another method,
Which I named the *Equal and Great Emptiness Observation*—
And found nothing to equalize.
Thus I came to know their depths and shallowness.

Shi Jianwu, after attaining the Dao, inscribed the *Three Abidings Inscription*:
*"The heart ever governs the qi,
The qi merges with the spirit."*

Zhu Qian expounded on *Perfect Awareness*:
*"The heart rests, dependent on stillness;
Stillness regulates the heart."*

I observe their principles—
Though different, they converge in essence.

There are three joys in the world:
The Confucian tradition says, *"Yan Zicheng’s bamboo basket and gourd in the humble lane—
His joy did not change."*
The Daoist tradition says, *"Zhuangzi’s child, holding a pestle and mortar in a hillside hut—
The world could not alter his joy."*
Zhu Qian’s school says, *"The joy of birth-and-death cessation, of extinction and final peace."*

These three progress from external to internal,
From shallow to profound.

As for the ills of delusive thoughts,
I attack them with principle.

What has passed, I do not dwell upon;
What is to come, I do not anticipate.

Someone asked: *"How does one verify practice?"*
I replied: *"Place two chess pieces—black and white.
For every good thought, cast the white piece;
For every evil thought, cast the black piece.
At night, tally them—
Then you will know your increase or decrease."*

Master Chao Wenyuan said: *"How roundabout!"*
I, however, within the four daily disciplines,
Do not count emotions or circumstances—
Only measure my strength and persist in still contemplation.

To endure insult while fearing its power is not true endurance;
To endure without fear is true endurance.

The *Yijing’s* *Sūn* [hexagram] says: *"Restrain anger, suppress desire."*
I take this as my warning.
The *Yijing’s* *Xìzì* [Appended Commentary] says: *"Leisurely and unmoved."*
I take this as my steadfastness.
The essence of meaning entering the spirit to achieve function—
I take this as wisdom.

Someone asked: *"What is the joy of leisure?"*
I replied: *"Harmonizing the Great Harmony’s qi,
Savoring the unadulterated taste of Heavenly Purity,
Delving into subtle and profound speech,
Wandering in the most refined Dao."*

Mengzi’s lofty sentiments, the teachers’ transformations;
Zhu Qian’s profound intent, purifying the spirit’s brilliance.

If external [disturbances] arise beyond principle,
Treat it like encountering a tiger—
Avoid it immediately, do not rely on the courage to subdue beasts.
If internal [disturbances] arise beyond principle,
Treat it like plunging into boiling water—
Stop immediately, do not indulge the desire to touch.

Protect the body externally,
As one would guard a towering tree in the sky—
Do not let a single axe’s edge harm it.
Guard conduct internally,
As one would guard a floating raft at sea—
Do not let a single needle’s point pierce it.

When the heart is still, it becomes clear;
When clear, it becomes luminous;
When luminous, it illuminates all things—
Nothing can escape its form.
Thus, the Perfect One observes it and attains the *heart-seal*.

There was a Tang-era man who nurtured a parrot,
Which could recite scriptures and always remained silent and unmoving.
Someone asked why, and he replied:
*"The body and mind are both unmoved—
This is how one seeks the Supreme Way."*

When he died and was cremated,
Sacred relics remained.
Thus, it is known that those who attain the Dao
All enter from within profound stillness.

Master Chao Wenyuan said:
*"As I grow old, my hearing and alertness only sharpen.
There is a natural sound, like a musical reed—
Faint yet resonant, like the first stirrings of thunder,
Vast yet approaching, like the tide’s arrival.*
I call these three *Mysterious Sounds*:
One—*the jade-washing of a hidden spring*;
Two—*the bronze bell shaking the void*;
Three—*the autumn cicada trailing its thread.*"

In the *Yongcheng Scripture*,
Who is the *Dark Elixir*?
Slandered as vain and false;
Its inner emptiness revealed—
Its path is as open as day.

The Perfect Wanderer said:
*"I once obtained Master Cui’s *Pharmaceutical Mirror*,
Which states: In the battle of copulation,
The host and guest are confused—
Same recognition, yet differing intentions;
Same depravity, yet differing accumulations;
Same intercourse, yet differing bodies;
Same bodies, yet differing intercourse—
This is called the ‘unmoving mirror’."*

He who can merge the inner and outer spirits
While the body remains unmoved
Has attained the Dao of true nature.

If movement occurs, the spirit departs—
The true nature is then in sorrow.
If untouched and unattached,
The original substance remains,
Allowing the qi to settle and the spirit to dwell,
Harmonizing to form the central palace,
Eliminating the yin and preserving the yang.

The *Red Snow*—the true essence of the *Blood Sea*—
Is the very substance that forms the human body.
Within the womb, it is yang qi;
When released, it becomes blood.

When the tortoise enters,
Wait for its movement to stir emotions,
Then it twists its neck, closes its breath, and drinks [the essence],
Using rhythmic strokes to draw it in.
When the qi settles and the spirit unites,
The qi enters the *Passageway* [of the spine],
And the *Luo River Vehicle* is drawn upward,
Ascending to Kunlun, paying homage at the Golden Gate,
Entering the *Elixir Field*,
And once more forming the elixir.

The Perfect Wanderer, upon hearing this, exclaimed in astonishment:
*"Master Cui truly spoke of this!"*

I have heard from the ancient Perfect Ones that this was never practiced.

In the past, Zhang Daoling’s teachings of the Yellow and Red Dao, and the method of blending *qi*, were merely one technique for spreading Daoist transformation—hardly the affairs of True Persons. Yet when Zhang Daoling’s movement arose, he no longer practiced this either.

The Pure and Refined True Person said: *"I have seen those who practiced this die from absolute depletion; I have never seen one survive."*

To preserve the mind, observe the inner *bao*#4, and walk the Upper Dao—this is what is called embracing the jade and rushing into fire, burying gold in a dog’s grave. The Purple Cloud Lady said: *"Those who practice the Yellow and Red Scriptures merely serve to summon the drums of the Three Officials and invite punishment."*

The True Person’s shadowy reflections exist only in the two shadows—this is not the intimacy of husband and wife.

If Yellow and Red persist within, how could one ever see the True Person or the Spirit Person?

Wei Boyang said: *"Cutting flesh to insert into the abdomen cannot form a fetus; thus, external substances cannot be made into elixir."* This is clear.

Thus, one who studies the Dao takes purity and stillness as the essence, and inward observation as the foundation. Only then, with deep roots and firm foundations, can pure *qi* be steadfastly guarded, the spirit kept from wandering, and when *kan* and *li* intersect, the Great Medicine be completed.

Ah! Zhuangzi said: *"Only when you polish and purify, without exhausting your body or agitating your essence, can you attain longevity. I have never heard of one who took a woman and attained immortality."*

Only Shou Han Ling Shouguang claimed, *"By practicing this method, I have lived nearly four or five hundred years, my hair and beard entirely white, yet my flesh and sinews remain robust."* Yet in the end, he still could not escape death.

Those in the world who claim to delight in taking women and achieve results should be no different from Shouguang. If Shouguang could not escape death, then how can this Dao truly speak to the principles of eternal life and prolonged vision?

Those alchemists, using methods of warfare to deceive scholars and officials, fearing their words lack credibility, secretly borrow the names of ancient Perfect Ones to lend authority to their texts. Thus, they claim *The Twenty-Four Chapters of Western Hua* was written by Zhongli Yunfang, and *The Eighteen Chapters of Western Jiang Yue* was written by Zhang Pingzhu.

「The alchemists point to women as the *Yǎn Yuè Lú* (a furnace shaped like a crescent moon), and claim that young men and women are the true *qiān yín* (lead and mercury), using filth and turbidity as their *dāo guī* (medicinal knife and ruler). Indulging in lust to its utmost, they perish in a single day—this is called *Tǒng Dǐ Tuō* (the "Escape from the Wine Vessel").

To this, **Zhì Yóu Zǐ** (Master of Ultimate Refinement) replied: *"The Way taught by Master Cui was once obtained by Lü Dongbin, who said it clarified his mind. If Master Cui’s method were flawed and not pure, then how could Lü Dongbin have received it? Perhaps it was a deception passed down by those alchemists?"*

Someone else asked: *"Those who attain the fruit of *wú lòu* (leakage-free/immaculate fruition) should enrich their source while economizing their expenditure. That is why lotus flowers do not grow on highlands or flat plains, but instead arise from mud. What does this mean?"*

**Zhì Yóu Zǐ** replied: *"The Daoists speak of eight *lòu* (leakages/defilements), and Zhù Qiān’s (Master Zhu Qian’s) method involves *zhū yǒu* (various forms of existence). My *wú lòu* is not what you refer to as *lòu*!

As **Sīmǎ Zǐ Wēi** (Master Sima the Subtle) states:
*"The leakage of *zhì* (aspiration) is when the form descends to the *yīn tǔ* (underworld).
The leakage of *niàn* (thought) is when the spirit wanders to the *guǐ xiāng* (ghostly realm).*

My immaculate fruition means no such leakage occurs. To enrich one’s intake while economizing one’s output is indeed the cultivation of *qi*—this is the *tāi xī* (fetal breathing) of the *Dà Mó* (Great Dharma/Ultimate Way).

The lotus from mud is easily destroyed, unlike the pine and cypress that grow on ridges and hills without ever withering. I too have my lotus—one that has emerged from the midst of fierce flames.

Some who hear this may doubt and ask **Zhì Yóu Zǐ**: *"The teachings of Róngchéng Zǐ (Master Rongcheng), Wùchéng Zǐ (Master Wucheng), Tiān Lǎo (The Heavenly Elder), and Tài Yī (The Supreme Unity), along with those of Yáo (Emperor Yao), Shùn (Emperor Shun), Chéng Tāng (King Cheng Tang), and Pángēng (King Pangeng), all contain books on *yīn dǎo* (guiding the yin/sexual essence). The Yellow Emperor and the Three Sovereigns (Sān Wáng) also possess methods for *yǎng yáng* (nourishing the yang/vital essence). The Han dynasty kept these in the *Guǎng Nèi Zhàng* (Palace Repository), and they were recorded in the *Shénxiān Zhìlù* (Register of Immortals). Their origins are ancient—how can you claim they do not exist?"*

**Zhì Yóu Zǐ** replied: *"I do not say they do not exist—I merely state that they are not the true pursuit of the *xiān* (immortals). As heard from the disciples of Liú Xiàng and Bān Gù: *The art of the inner chambers is the culmination of human nature and the essence of the Dao. That is why sage-kings established regulations on external pleasures to restrain internal passions, creating proper rites and restrictions.*

When pleasure is tempered with restraint, harmony, longevity, and wisdom follow. Those who are lost in passion do not heed this, and thus bring illness and shorten their lives."*

Thus, it is indeed seen that this is not the true pursuit of the *xiān* (immortals).

In the *Yīnfú Piān* (Scripture of the Yin Symbols), the *Huángdì* (Yellow Emperor)’s classic, enshrined in *Shénsōng* (Divine Summit), **Liú Xiàng** obtained it and lifted the veil of ignorance from the world.

**Liú Xiàng** acquired the Yellow Emperor’s *Yīnfú* classic from the *Shénsōng* mountain, yet he did not grasp its ultimate purpose. Later, he encountered the *Líshān Lǎo* (Old Lady of Mount Li) and questioned her. She said:

*"The Dao has the **Tàiyì** (Supreme Simplicity), the **Tàichū** (Supreme Primordiality), the **Tàishǐ** (Supreme Beginning), and the **Tàisù** (Supreme Purity).
The **Tàiyì** is the obscure and unfathomable **Xuányuán** (Primordial Mystery), wondrous beyond all names.
The **Tàichū** is the mingled and chaotic **páotāi** (Fetal Embryo).
The **Tàishǐ** is the boundless **dòngxū** (Penetrating Void), which sometimes manifests upon sensation.
The **Tàisù** is the inner containment of the **Zhēnyī** (True Unity)’s essence, the raw foundation of all things—clear *qīngyáng* (pure yang) as Heaven, turbid *zhuóyīn* (impure yin) as Earth.

Yang is the **hún** (ethereal soul), yin is the **pò** (corporeal spirit).
The **hún** seeks to sustain life;
the **pò** seeks to hasten death.
Therefore, the sage observes the Dao of Heaven, follows Heaven’s course, embraces the True and holds to the Unity, returning to the **Tàiyáng** (Supreme Yang) to nourish the yang **hún** and dispel the yin **pò**. Here lies the full extent of the path to *shénxiān* (immortality).

Heaven, through the number **one**, generates water to moisten what is below; it dwells in the north, marking the season of **winter**, corresponding to the **kidney** in the body, known as the **Xuánwǔ** (Mysterious Tortoise)—this is the **kǎn** (abyss) hexagram.
Earth, through the number **two**, generates fire to flame upward; it dwells in the south, marking the season of **summer**, corresponding to the **heart** in the body, known as the **Zhūquè** (Vermilion Bird)—this is the **lí** (fire) hexagram.
Heaven, through the number **three**, generates wood to bend and straighten; it dwells in the east, marking the season of **spring**, corresponding to the **liver** in the body, known as the **Qīnglóng** (Azure Dragon)—this is the **zhèn** (thunder) hexagram.
Earth, through the number **four**, generates metal to follow and transform; it dwells in the west, marking the season of **autumn**, corresponding to the **lung** in the body, known as the **Bái Hǔ** (White Tiger)—this is the **duì** (joy) hexagram.
Heaven, through the number **five**, generates soil as the **jìqiáng** (cultivation walls), dwelling at the center, the mother of all things, corresponding to the **spleen** in the body.

Thus, the Dao gives rise to **one**; **one** is Heaven.
The **Five Phases** (*wǔxíng*) emerge from **one**, as the **Zhēnyī** *qi* (true unity essence) transforms into the Five Phases. That is why the five grains and five flavors nourish humanity.
Humans live by the Five Phases and die by the Five Phases—thus, the Five Phases are the **Five Bandits** (*wǔzéi*).

The sage seizes the Five Phases’ essence-*qi*, returns to the origin and restores the root, thus reuniting with the **Zhēnyī**—this is what **Lǎozi** (Old Master) spoke of: *‘All things in the world, each returning to its root; returning to the root is called stillness, and stillness is called preserving life.’*

Now, the **nature** (*xìng*) is the bright clarity of yang.
The essence of bright clarity condenses into **humanity** (*rén*), stagnant *qi* becomes **ghosts** (*guǐ*), refined *qi* becomes **spirits** (*shén*), turbulent *qi* becomes **beasts and insects** (*chóngwǔ*).
Mixed *qi* forms **birds and beasts** (*qínshòu*), and deceitful *qi* breeds **malevolent spirits** (*jīngxié*).
When one discerns the bright clarity, one can perceive its **mechanisms** (*jī*), and perceiving its mechanisms allows one to establish the Dao of Heaven.

From the fifth month at the **Summer Solstice** (*xiàzhì*), the **#5** hexagram takes effect, and by the tenth month, it becomes **pure kūn** (pure yin)—when yin is excessive, it consumes the yang.
From the eleventh month at the **Winter Solstice** (*dōngzhì*), the **#5** hexagram again takes effect, and by the fourth month, it becomes **pure qián** (pure yang)—when yang is excessive, it consumes the yin.
Thus, dragons and serpents **hibernate** (*qián*) in autumn and winter, and **emerge** (*qǐ*) onto land in spring and summer.
When humanity dispels the yin **demons** (*mó*) with true yang, the hundred spirits harmonize and rejoice, the blood and *qi* flow unimpeded, the five *zàng* (viscera) generate **moisture** (*jīn*), and one attains **longevity** (*chángnián*) and **clear vision** (*jiǔshì*).

This is why **Guǎngchéng Zǐ** (Master Guangcheng) accumulated fire to burn the **Five Toxins** (*wǔdú*)—the Five Toxins are the Five Bandits.
Heaven’s birth is from **kǎn** (abyss), Earth’s birth is from **lí** (fire).
**Kǎn** is water, moon, and **mercury** (*gǒngyín*).
**Lí** is fire, sun, and **lead** (*qiān*).

The sage makes **kǎn** and **lí** alternate in function, so that sun and moon intermingle, lead and mercury balance each other, and the Dragon and Tiger oppose one another—only then can one **sever the corpse** (*zhǎnshī*) and **extinguish the ghosts** (*mièguǐ*), subdue the **semen** (*jīng*) and **absorb malevolence** (*shèxié*), preserving the **orthodox qi** (*zhèngqì*).

Thus, **Tàibái Zhēnrén** (True Person of the Great White) says: *"When the Five Phases do not proceed in order, the Dragon arises from fire, and the Tiger emerges from water."* This is the **mutual interplay** (*hùyòng*) of Heaven and Earth, the **reversal** (*fǎnfù*) of yin and yang.

Earth is the **root** (*běn*) of the **Four Symbols** (*sìxiàng*), the **foundation** (*jī*) of all transformations.
The Dao generates **one**, **one** generates **two**, **two** generates **three**, and **three** generates all things.
**One** is Heaven; **three** is humanity.
The essentials of *shénxiān* (immortality) lie in **embracing Unity and holding the Center** (*bàoyīshǒuzhōng*).
That is why the **Supreme Dao** (*shìdào*) begins with **one** and **three**, and culminates in **five**.
**Five** is the **number** (*shù*).
The classic says: *"Three, five, and one—all affairs are complete."* What Dao is this?
It is the Dao of **lead and mercury** (*qiān gǒngyín*) obtaining **Earth** (*tǔ*) to form the **Elixir of Reversion** (*huándān*).

**Yānluó Zǐ** (Master Yan Luo) says: *"Preserving the whole Unity has three aspects: the outer correspondence must still fulfill the **initial nine** (*chūjiǔ*), this is the Supreme Dao.*
When yang is **overabundant** (*tàishèng*), it **overflows** (*yì*), overflowing generates **heat** (*rè*), and heat **solidifies the pulse** (*shìmài*).
When yin is **excessive** (*tàishèng*), it **decays** (*shuāi*), decaying generates **cold** (*hán*), and cold **weakens the pulse** (*xūmài*).
The **deficient and replete pulses** (*xūshí zhī mài*) and the **ailments of heat and cold** (*hànrè zhī huàn*) can all lead to death.
Yang is **mercury** (*gǒngyín*), its nature being **volatile** (*fēi*).
Yin is **lead** (*qiān*), its nature being **subdued** (*fú*).
The sage **subdues the volatile yang-mercury** (*fùyáng qiān*), refining its **spirit** (*pò*);
**restrains the leaden yin** (*fēiyīn qiān*), binding its **ethereal soul** (*hún*).
When yang cannot overflow and yin cannot overpower, then **external pathogens** (*kèxié*) are dispelled and the **corporeal spirit** (*shīpò*) is lost.
Truly, if there remains even a **hair’s breadth of yang** (*háo fā zhī yáng*), one cannot die;
if there remains even a **hair’s breadth of yin** (*háo fā zhī yīn*), one cannot attain *shénxiān* (immortality).

Now, when the **ears indulge in licentious sounds** (*yínshēng*), the **eyes delight in beauty** (*měisè*), and the **mouth craves flavors** (*zīwèi*), then the five *zàng* (viscera) **agitate** (*yáodòng*) and become unsettled, the blood and *qi* **drift** (*liúdàng*) and are unstable, the **spirit** (*shén*) and **essence** (*jīng*) **scatter** (*fēichí*) and do not remain—thus, the **orthodox qi** (*zhèngqì*) dissipates, and **dampness-pathogens** (*shīxié*) seize the opportunity to generate **illness** (*jī*).

Therefore, humanity’s **three critical orifices** (*sān yāo*) are:
the **ear**, the **eye**, and the **mouth**.
Hence, the **ear and eye** are the **windows and doors of the spirit** (*shén zhī chuāngyǒu*);
the **mouth** is the **portal of qi and fluids** (*qì yè zhī ménhù*).

「Now, if the six *shí* (senses/perceptions) are all **emptied** (*kōng*), serene and void, abandoning form and forgetting matter, while **illuminating wisdom** (*huìzhào*) permeates the **spirit** (*shén*), then this is the **supreme stillness** (*zhìjìng*). To **expel and inhale** (*tǔnà*) in refining the five *zàng* (viscera), to **guide and pull** (*dǎoyǐn*) in opening the hundred *guān* (passages/locks), to recite and uphold **precious scriptures** (*bǎozhāng*) in soothing the spirit, to absorb and draw the **two luminaries** (*èryǐng*) in gathering **clarity** (*míng*), to refine **golden essence** (*jīnjīng*) in solidifying form, and to consume **jade dew** (*yùyīng*) in preserving the body—this is the **supreme activity** (*zhìdòng*).

The **Supreme Sage** (*Tàishàng*) said: **"Stillness"** is **nature** (*xìng*); **"activity"** is **qi** (*qì*). When activity and stillness are as one, the inner and outer are harmonious—this is not something ordinary mortals can attain!

Now, **pursuit of honor and wealth** (*róngmíng fùguì*) are the **dust and grime of Dao cultivation** (*xué Dào zhī chén gòu*); **quarrels and wrath** (*zhēngjìng fènyáo*) are the **thorns and brambles of refining true nature** (*xiū zhēn zhī jīngjí*); **rich wine and delicacies** (*zhíjiǔ zhēn cuàn*) are the **axes and spears that harm nature** (*fá xìng zhī gē máo*); **licentious sounds and beauty** (*yínshēng měisè*) are the **hatchets and saws that shatter the bones** (*pò gǔ zhī fǔ jué*).

Thus, those who **refine true nature and cultivate qi** (*xiū zhēn liàn qì*), **embrace the Primordial and maintain the One** (*bào yuán shǒu yī*), are called **Sages** (*shèngrén*); those who **refine form and solidify qi** (*liàn xíng chéng qì*) are called **True Ones** (*zhēnrén*); those who **refine qi to attain spirit** (*liàn qì chéng shén*) are called **Spiritual Ones** (*shénrén*); and those who **refine spirit to return to true nature** (*liàn shén chéng zhēn*) are called **Supreme Ones** (*zhìrén*).

**Heaven and Earth** are **thieves** (*zéi*) who **plunder** (*dào*) all things, causing them to **wither and decay** (*suī xiǔ*). All things **plunder humanity**, causing **aging and death** (*lǎo sǐ*). Humanity **plunders all things**, yet does so without **constant possession** (*bù cháng cún*)—this is how **utility** (*yòng*) arises. Thus, those who do not **skillfully plunder** (*bù shàn dào*) take only the **form** (*xíng*) but not the **essence** (*jīng*), and in turn are **plundered by all things**. The **skillful plunderers** take the **essence**, and thus are able to **plunder all things** and **attain longevity** (*chángshēng*).

I eat **seasonably** (*qí shí*), not because I crave **wine and sensuality** (*yǐnshēng*), but because I **plunder the essence and qi of all things**. Why so? The **form relies on flavors** (*xíng yǐ shí wèi*), the **spirit relies on qi** (*shén yǐ shí qì*). If one eats **seasonably** to nourish the **form** (*shí xíng*), **stimulating its vitality** (*dòng qì*), yet **plunders its essence** (*dào jīng*), then the **hundreds of bodily members** (*bǎi tǐ*) will follow **natural order** (*shùn lǐ*).

Within my **body**, there are **spirits of luminous essence** (*jīng guāng zhī shén*), **spirits of form and shadow** (*xíng yǐng zhī shén*), and **spirits of pores and hair** (*máo kǒng zhī shén*), each numbering **two thousand**. The five *zàng* (viscera) and six *fǔ* (entrails), as well as the **three Primordials and nine palaces** (*sān yuán jiǔ gōng*), also all possess **spirits**. Yet, if I do not **perceive their spirits** (*wú jiàn shén*), I do not know how they **bestow blessings or calamities** (*xià fú huò*).

Therefore, those who do not **practice reverence** (*jìngwèi*) will fall into **cruelty and rage** (*hěn yáo*), **fierceness and savagery** (*xiōng yè*), **greed and licentiousness** (*tān yín*), and **treachery** (*yīn xiǎn*)—this is **robbery of the spirit** (*zéi shén*). Those who **speak falsely and in vain** (*wàng yán qǐ yǔ*), assuming others **do not know or see** (*bù zhī bù jiàn*), are **obscuring their spirit** (*mèi shén*). My **spirit** connects upward to **Heaven** (*tiān*); thus, those who **rob the spirit** are **offending Heaven**, and those who **obscure the spirit** are **deceiving Heaven**. To **offend and deceive Heaven** is to **invite untimely death** (*qǔ tiāozhé*).

As such, **dampness-pathogens** (*shīxié*) grow stronger daily, the **spirit and qi** (*shén qì*) weaken daily, and the **corporeal shell and ethereal shadow** (*shī máng pò huáng*) run rampant.

Those who can **guard the center and embrace the One** (*shǒu zhōng bào yī*), refining **yin with yang** (*yǐng yǐ yáng liàn*), will **banish the corpse and scatter the shadow** (*shī wáng pò huáng*), and their **spirit and clarity will reign supreme** (*shén míng wáng yě*). Once the **spirit and clarity reign**, they can **ride the eight winds** (*cè pèi bā chén*), **fly in the celestial chariot over the five peaks** (*fēi yú wǔ yuè*), **ascend the nine celestial depths** (*shēng jiǔ xuán*), **sever the jade barrier** (*zhǎn yù guān*), and thus **equal Heaven and Earth in years** (*kě yǔ tiān dì děng nián*).

The **Venerable Laozi** (*Lǎozǐ*) said: **"Qi within qi"** (*qì zhōng yǒu qì*) is my **spirit**; **"spirit within spirit"** (*shén zhōng yǒu shén*) is the **natural Dao** (*zìrán zhī Dào*). Heaven, with **one yang**, descends to the **nine abysses** (*jiǔ quán*), giving rise to **repletion** (*fù*), which is the **first month of the eleven-month yang** (*shí yī yuè yáng zhī shǐ*). When **two yangs** descend, **pregnancy** (*lín*) arises; when **three yangs** descend, **fulfillment** (*tài*) arises; when **four yangs** descend, **great vigor** (*dà zhuàng*) arises; when **five yangs** descend, **maturity** (*fū*) arises; when **six yangs** descend, **completion** (*qián*) arises. At the **summer solstice of the fifth month**, the yang reaches its **peak** (*jí*), and **yin** arises.

Thus, when **one yin** ascends, **encounter** (*gòu*) arises; when **two yins** ascend, **delay** (*chí*) arises; when **three yins** ascend, **opposition** (*pǐ*) arises; when **four yins** ascend, **contemplation** (*guàn*) arises; when **five yins** ascend, **decline** (*bō*) arises; when **six yins** ascend, **receptivity** (*kūn*) arises. The **eclipse and revival, ascent and descent of yin and yang** (*yīn yáng xiāo xī shēng jiàng*) are the **pivotal axis of the Dao** (*sī Dào zhī shū*).

Thus, the **Sage** gathers the **qi of Heaven and Earth** (*shōu cǎi tiān dì zhī qì*) to form **two substances** (*èr tǐ*), called **lead** (*qiān*) and **mercury** (*gǒng*). Each weighs **eight liǎng** (*bā liǎng*), yet together they **combine into 384 chǔ** (*hé yú sān bǎi bā shí sì chǔ zhī shù*), corresponding to the **trigrams and lines** (*guà yáo*) to establish the **laws of great and small** (*dìng dà xiǎo zhī fǎ*).

Above, they **measure the trigrams and qi** (*qǐ guà qì*); below, they **calculate the water clock and divisions** (*tuī lòu kè*), to **balance the five phases’ fire** (*jūn huǒ zhī hòu*) and **harness the power of eighteen hundred years** (*duó yī qiān bā bǎi nián zhī gōng*), thereby **shedding their mortal shell** (*tuō fán tāi*).

At **three thousand two hundred forty years**, the **Sage’s body** (*shèng tāi*) is **perfected**, and thus they **harmonize with Creation** (*cù huà*), **align with the movement of yin and yang** (*yīn yáng tóng yùn*), and **Sagehood is born** (*shèng gōng shēng yàn*), **spirit and clarity emerge** (*shén míng chū yàn*).

The **blind** (*gǔ*) see **nothing**, so their **spirit focuses solely on hearing** (*shén zhuān zài ěr*); the **deaf** (*lóng*) hear **nothing**, so their **spirit focuses solely on sight** (*shén zhuān zài mù*). When the **spirit is concentrated**, no matter is beyond their **precision** (*shì wú bù jīng yě*).

**Profit and gain** (*lì*) can **stir humanity** (*dòng rén*); severing the **source of profit** (*jué lì zhī yuán*) allows the **spirit to concentrate** (*shén yǒu suǒ zhuān*), enabling one to **control lustful pathogens** (*zhì jīng xié*), and to **banish the corpse and annihilate the shadow** (*shī wáng pò huáng*) with **thousandfold efficacy** (*yǒu qiān bèi zhī gōng*).

Laozi said: **"Do not see what is desirable, and the heart will not be disturbed"** (*bù jiàn kě yù, shǐ xīn bù luàn*)—this is what is meant!

Now, what are the **"Nine Returns and Seven Reversions"** (*jiǔ huán qī fǎn*)? They are the **cycles from Child to Monkey** (*zǐ ér zhì shēn*), and from **Tiger to Dog** (*yín ér zhì xū*). These are all **one yin and one yang** (*yī yīn yī yáng*), **one ascent and one descent** (*yī shēng yī jiàng*), **one submersion and one concealment** (*yī chén yī fú*), dwelling in **day and night** (*zhòu yè jū zhī*) without **losing their place** (*ér bù shī*).

When the **water and fire** (*shuǐ huǒ*) trigrams **cycle fully**, the **elixir is perfected** (*huán dān chéng yě*). Thus, one can **control lustful pathogens** (*zhì jīng xié*), **banish the corpse and annihilate the shadow** (*shī wáng pò huáng*), and achieve **ten-thousandfold efficacy** (*yǒu wàn bèi zhī gōng*).

Wei Boyang said: **"The trigrams of *Lún* (Difficulty) are applied at Monkey and Child** (*tún yòng shēn zǐ*); **the trigrams of *Méng* (Darkness) are applied at Tiger and Dog** (*méng yòng yín xū*). Each of the **sixty-four trigrams** has its own **day**, and these are the **three reversions of day and night’s principle** (*sān fǎn zhòu yè zhī lǐ*).

The **heart** is the **master of ten-thousand spirits** (*wàn shén zhī zhǔ*); the **eyes** are the **windows and doors of ten-thousand spirits** (*wàn shén zhī mén yǒu*). When the **spirit enters humanity**, it is **stored in the heart** (*cáng yú xīn*); when it **exits**, it is **manifested in the eyes** (*xiàn yú mù*). Thus, if the **heart is at ease**, the **spirit is at ease** (*xīn ān shén ān*); if the **eyes move**, the **heart moves** (*mù dòng xīn dòng*); if the **heart moves**, the **spirit moves** (*xīn dòng shén dòng*), and the **mechanism of life and death** (*shēng sǐ zhī jī*) lies within these **two**.

Those who can **make their spirit exit and enter through the windows and doors** (*shén chū rù yú mén yǒu*) to **self-illuminate** (*zì zhào*), and **rest within the dwelling and abode** (*jū xī yú zhái shè*) to **self-soothe** (*zì ān*), have **activated the mechanism of life** (*shì shēng zhī jī*). Those who **block the windows and doors** (*sè mén yǒu*) and thus **do not illuminate** (*bù míng*), or **abandon the dwelling and abode** (*fèi zhái shè*) and **do not rest** (*bù jū*), have **activated the mechanism of death** (*shì sǐ zhī jī*).

Wei Boyang said: **"The five phases mutually receive each other to give rise to life** (*wǔ xíng xiāng shòu yǐ shēng*), so **fire’s nature is to melt gold** (*huǒ xìng shuò jīn*), and **gold’s nature is to cut wood** (*jīn fǎ mù róng*). These **three fives** (*sān wǔ*) and **three nines** (*sān jiǔ*) are the **ultimate essence of Heaven and Earth** (*tiān dì zhī zhì jīng*).

The **root and origin** (*fǎn běn guī gēn*)—thus do the ten thousand things **thereby arise in life** (*wàn wù nǎi yīn cǐ ér shēng*).
**Yin and Yang contend in victory** (*yīn yáng xiāng shèng*), the **Five Phases mutually restrain** (*wǔ xíng xiāng zhì*), **by which means** (*suǒ yǐ*) **conquest, punishment, decay, and decline** (*kè fá cuī xiè*) occur.

Yet, **when one returns to the root and abides by the origin** (*fǎn běn guī gēn*), then the ten thousand things **thereby arise in life** (*wàn wù nǎi yīn cǐ ér shēng*).
**When Yin and Yang are stirred**, they become **wind and thunder** (*yīn yáng jī ér wéi fēng léi*); **wind and thunder act**, and the ten thousand things **move and flourish in growth** (*wàn wù dòng ér zī shēng*).

**To refine the Yin and Yang qi** (*huǎn yīn yáng zhī qì*), **like the wind in motion** (*rú fēng zhī xíng*), **like the thunder in rumble** (*rú léi zhī wū*), **to make flow and circulate the hundred vessels** (*tōng liú qí bǎi mài*), **to purge and remove the accumulated stagnant Five Evils** (*táo qù qí jī zhì zhī wǔ dú*), **thus the Five Zang-organs generate Vital Fluids** (*jīn wèi shēng jīng*), **the hundred bones and sinews are harmonized and unobstructed** (*bǎi gāi tiáo chàng*), and **the True Unity abides within** (*zhēn yī cún hū qí zhōng*).

**To not shame poverty and lowliness** (*bù chǐ pín jiàn*), **to not covet wealth and nobility** (*bù tān fù guì*), **to not indulge in sounds and colors** (*bù shì shēng sè*), **to not be entangled by fame and profit** (*bù dān míng lì*), **to not fear calamity and adversity** (*bù jù huàn nàn*), **to not act in disgrace or humiliation** (*bù zuò chù rǔ*), **externally seeking nothing** (*wài wú suǒ qiú*), **internally undisturbed** (*nèi wú suǒ huò*), **to see only in the Void** (*wéi jiàn yú kōng*)—
**The Void has nothing to void** (*kōng wú suǒ kōng*), **serene and ever tranquil** (*zhàn rán cháng jì*), **then by day there are no thoughts** (*yú shì zhòu wú xiǎng*), **by night there are no dreams** (*yè wú mèng*). **Thus, the spirit dwells in supreme bliss** (*qī shén qī zhī zhì lè*), **and the Heavenly True Nature is in abundance** (*tiān zhēn zhī xìng yǒu yú*), **while turbid and chaotic emotions do not arise** (*zhuó luàn zhī qíng bù zuò yǐ*).

**Approaching the boundary of supreme stillness** (*qū biān yú zhì jìng*), **greed and desire do not manifest** (*tān qiú bù shēng*), **and the heart has nowhere to stray** (*xīn wú suǒ wǎng*).

**The flying crow restrains its body and soars in emptiness** (*fēi wū zhì qí shēn yóu yú kōng xū*), **leaning upon its qi** (*píng qí qì*).
**The deceased** (*sǐ fū*) **refine their form into supreme Yang** (*xiū liàn qí xíng ér chéng zhì yáng*), **and thus can enter gold and stone without obstruction** (*qí néng rù jīn shí ér bù yè*), **traverse Sun and Moon without shadow** (*xíng rì yuè ér wú yǐng*), **which is their inherent principle** (*gù qí lǐ*).

**The people of the world must consume food and drink to nourish their form** (*shì zhī rén xū yǐn shí yǐ yǎng qí xíng*), **yet they do not know that by abstaining from food and drink, their form becomes firm** (*bù zhī jué yǐn shí ér xíng nǎi gù yǎn*).
**They must preserve the corpse-like shell to nourish their spirit** (*xū shī pò yǐ yǎng qí shén*), **yet they do not know that by discarding the corpse-like shell, their spirit becomes complete** (*bù zhī qù shī pò ér shén nǎi quán yǎn*).
**They must have Yang and Yin together to aid in life** (*xū yáng yǔ yīn bìng xiāng jì yǐ shēng*), **yet they do not know that when Yin is exhausted and Yang is pure, eternal life ensues** (*bù zhī yīn jìn yáng chún zé zhǎng shēng yǐ*).

**Western Ascension (西升) Section:**

When the wandering sage **Zeng Yan** (曾慥) collected it, the **Mysterious Thread (玄言)** of Western Ascension—
only **Li Mozi** (力默子) holds its essence;
**Yinzi** (尹子) embraced the Dao and journeyed westward,
to teach **Yin Xi** (尹喜).

As **Laozi** (老子) prepared to enter the Western Regions,
**Yinzi** (尹子), **Yin Xi** (尹喜) by name, encountered him at the pass and inquired about the Dao.

Laozi said:
*"The boundless void and indistinct haze—
this is the root of the Dao (道).
It gave birth to me in emptiness (虚),
placed me in nonexistence (无),
so the one who birthed me was the **divine (神)**,
and the one who ended me was the **heart (心)**.
Thus, the body (身) is the **divine’s** chariot, dwelling, and master.
When the body is tranquil and still, the **divine** abides within it;
when the body is restless and agitated, the **divine** departs from it.
Therefore, if one preserves the **divine** while externalizing the body,
the **radiant essence (精曜)** remains."*

When the Dao is attained in its singular unity (一合),
one becomes harmonized with the Dao (道).

The **virtuous person (善人)** does not contend with all things,
but remains humble, empty, and without desire (無欲).
Thus, desire (欲) is the root of calamity and harm (凶害);
nonexistence (無) is the primal origin of heaven and earth (天地).

The **sage (圣人)** abandons desire and enters nonexistence,
thereby aiding the preservation of their body (辅其身).

I gaze without seeing, listen without hearing,
speak without uttering words, eat without tasting flavor.
Silent and detached, I attain **Supreme Clarity (太清)**—
**effortless action (无为)**, where the **qi (气)** naturally returns to its unborn state.
The **woeful (哀人)** are not pitied as much as their bodies (身);
one who cherishes their body (身) for a day is better than one who loves their **divine (神)**,
one who loves their **divine (神)** is better than one who abandons it,
one who abandons their **divine (神)** is better than one who guards their body,
and one who guards their body will thus endure forever.

The **divine (神)** is the origin of form (生形);
form is the fulfillment of the **divine (成神)**.
Thus, if form does not attain its **divine (神)**,
it cannot sustain itself in life (自生).
If the **divine (神)** does not attain its form,
it cannot manifest itself (自成).

When form and **divine (神)** are harmonized and unified,
they mutually generate and mutually nourish—
this is their perfect balance.

The highest filial piety in the world
is to be able to nourish one’s mother.
He who can love his mother
will thus prolong his own life (身).

The **emptiness (虚)** of the body—
all things gather therein;
the **nonexistence (无)** of the heart—
**harmonious qi (和气)** returns thereto.

Thus, the one who skillfully nourishes their body
conceals their body within their body, unseen,
and hides their **divine (神)** within others, unperceived.

Why so?
Because they perpetually regard **emptiness (虚)** as the body,
and **nonexistence (无)** as the heart—
this is the **body without body (无身之身)**,
the **heart without heart (无心之心)**.

Thus, they preserve the **divine (神)** in its utmost clarity,
and this is called **harmonization with the Dao (道同)**.

My life lies within me alone,
not dependent on heaven and earth (天地).
If I do not see, do not hear, do not know,
then the **divine (神)** does not depart from my body,
and I endure in harmony with the Dao.

I share with heaven and earth a single **qi (气)**,
and govern myself by preserving its root (根本).

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than **qi (气)**;
nothing is softer or weaker than the Dao (道).
The Dao’s softness and weakness
are what enfold heaven and earth,
and penetrate all things.

Thus, the soft can generate the firm,
the weak can produce the strong—
yet none know the origin from which they spring.

Nonexistence (无) has **emptiness (虚)** as its mother;
**emptiness (虚)** has the Dao (道) as its mother—
this is the Dao’s root.

Why is it called the Dao?
Because it commands:
*"Though the **divine (神)** resides within the body,
it must not be allowed to remain in the body."*

**Flourishing arises from decay (盛生於衰)**;
**yin (阴)** emerges from **yang (阳)**.
Thus, existence and nonexistence mutually generate,
**emptiness (虚)** and **fullness (实)** mutually complete.

Therefore, existence returns to existence,
nonexistence returns to nonexistence.

Humans dwell within the Dao;
the Dao dwells within humans—
like fish within water,
water within fish.

When the Dao departs, humans die;
when the waters dry, fish perish.

Thus, the **sage (圣人)** reverses to the unborn state,
hiding their form (隐),
preserving their **divine (神)** (留),
and all under heaven submits thereto.

With **effortless action (无为)** and **non-interference (无事)**,
the state flourishes and the people prosper—
this is the constant of preserving the Dao,
known as **Mysterious Harmony (玄同)**.

Humans attain life through the **divine (神)**,
yet do not know where the **divine (神)** resides.
Only the **sage (圣人)** conceals the **divine (神)** within,
so their **vital spirit (魄)** does not stray.
To guard their mother (原),
their child (子) remains whole,
and the people thrive in abundance.

The method of **nourishing life (养生)**,
penetrating the **primordial essence (玄元)** and **mixed qi (混气)**,
is to reflect and preserve one’s self.

Heaven does not desire **clarity (清)**;
**clarity (清)** naturally returns.
Earth does not desire **turbulence (浊)**;
**turbulence (浊)** naturally returns.
**Moisture (湿)** does not desire **water (水)**;
**water (水)** naturally returns.
**Dryness (燥)** does not desire **fire (火)**;
**fire (火)** naturally returns.
The **void (虚空)** and **effortless action (无为)** do not desire the Dao;
the Dao naturally returns.

From this perspective,
what nature is not **self-so (自然)**?

After Laozi had fully expounded his Dao,
he again instructed Yinzi:
*"I speak to you of the essentials of the **Supreme Dao (至道)**:
tranquilize the heart and guard the One (一),
and all impurities will be dispelled,
all affairs completed."*

**Inner Virtue (内德) Section:**

The **Three Activities (三业)** and **Seven Emotions (七情)**,
having clarified their source (澄其源);
the **Five Spirits (五神)** preserved in their repositories,
seeking the **Three Unities (三一)** for eternal existence (求存).

The **Supreme One (太上)** says:
*"Tranquilize the **Three Activities (三业)**—mouth, eyes, ears—
clarify the **Seven Emotions (七情)**,
and the **Five Spirits (五神)** will each guard their repositories,
the **Three Unities (三一)** enduring forever."*

The **Three (三)** refers to the **primordial spirits (元神)** of the body,
the number **three (三)** of the **hexagram Li (离)**.
The **One (一)** refers to the **true essence (真精)** of the body,
the number **one (一)** of the **hexagram Kan (坎)**.

Within the body are **three thousand six hundred spirits (神)**,
**one thousand two hundred forms and shadows (形影)**,
**twelve thousand rays of essence (精光)**,
and the **Fourteen Spirits (神)** of the **five viscera (五脏)** and **six bowels (六腑)**.
To the left, **three souls (三魂)**;
to the right, **seven spirits (七魄)**—
one must constantly ponder them,
lest they depart from the body.

**Day (日)** is the **Functionary (功曹)**,
the **yang qi (阳气)**;
**Moon (月)** is the **Chief Clerk (主簿)**,
the **yin blood (阴血)**.

The **Thunder Lord’s (雷公) emissaries** reside in the **three souls (三魂)** of left and right;
the **Wind Marshal (风伯)** and **Rain Master (雨师)** dwell in the **seven spirits (七魄)** of front and back.

**Six Yang (六甲)** are the **six yang spirits (六阳神)**;
**Zhi Fu (直符)** are the **six yin spirits (六阴神)**—
they encircle the body.
The **Azure Dragon (青龙)** supports the left,
the **White Tiger (白虎)** supports the right,
the **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)** leads the front,
the **Dark Tortoise (玄武)** follows the rear—
these are the **four symbols (四象)** of the body.

The **Big Dipper (北斗)** covers the head,
the **spirit of essence (精光)**;
**Tian Chen (天呈)** points at the feet,
the **spirit of true qi (真气)**;
the **Victorious Serpent (胜蛇)** lies in the hands,
the **spirit of gall (胆)**.

I dwell within the **Elixir Field (丹房)**,
embracing the method of guarding the One (一).

The **Supreme Unity (太一)** is the **palace of the Lower Primordial (下元)**,
the **true primordial spirit (真元神)**—
this is my **companion (偶)**."

「Left Three, Right Seven, correspond to **Zhen (震)** and **Dui (兑)**—
the **Three Legs (三足)** and **Seven Stars (七星)** of the **Big Dipper (北斗)**;
**Wearing Nine, Treading One (戴九履一)**, correspond to **Li (离)** and **Kan (坎)**—
the **Heavenly Fire (天火)** and **Water (水)**;
**Two and Four as Shoulders (二四为肩)**, are **Kun (坤)** and **Xun (巽)**—
the **Earth (地)** and **Wind (风)**;
**Six and Eight as Feet (六八为足)**, are **Qian (乾)** and **Gèn (艮)**—
the **Heaven (天)** and **Mountain (山)**;
**Five dwells in the Central Palace (五居中宫)**, as **Earth (土)**—
these are the **Eight Trigrams (八卦)** and **Nine Palaces (九宫)** of the **spirits (神)**, all manifest within the **abdomen (腹)**.

In general, when one sleeps, the **spirits (神)**, **soul (魂)**, **essence (精)**, and **vital breath (魄)** disperse and wander outside. **Yin evils (阴邪)** may then exploit the gaps to steal one’s **essence and qi (精气)**. Therefore, one must summon the **Four Symbols (四兽)** to guard the body. What are the **Four Symbols (四兽)**?
The **Azure Dragon (青龙)** emerges from the **liver (肝)**,
the **White Tiger (白虎)** from the **lungs (肺)**,
the **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)** from the **heart (心)**,
the **Dark Tortoise (玄武)** from the **kidneys (肾)**.
Do not allow myriad evils to disturb the **Jade Palace (玉房)**.
The **Jade Palace (玉房)** is the **Essence Region (精区)**.
The **liver (肝)** governs storing the **soul (魂)**,
the **lungs (肺)** govern storing the **vital breath (魄)**,
the **heart (心)** governs storing the **spirit (神)**,
the **spleen (脾)** governs storing the **will (志)**,
the **kidneys (肾)** govern storing the **essence (精)**.
The **five visceral spirits (五脏之神)**, when summoned, repel evils,
when withdrawn, settle the **spirit (神)**.
Having guarded the body, they then return to their respective abodes.
**Inhale the Heavenly Qi (吻天鼓)** thirty-six times to gather the **spirit (神)**,
**swallow the saliva (咽液)** thirty-six times to gather the **qi (气)**,
and **close the Yin Gate (阴户)** with **yin lock (阴关)**,
preventing myriad evils from dwelling below.
**Closing the Qi (闭气)** means counting from one to ten in the mind,
then stopping at the **Nine Nines (九九)**— eighty-one breaths.
**Closing the Qi (闭气)** is not about constricting the breath,
but about **spirit stillness (神定)** and **qi harmony (气和)**,
cutting off thoughts and forgetting concerns,
so that the **nasal breath (鼻之息)** flows gently, as if present yet absent.
Pulse diagnosis shows six movements as one breath,
and the **Nine Nines (九九)**— eighty-one breaths.
Always retain the **Red Qi (赤气)** emerging from the mouth,
like a fiery wheel encircling the chamber.
When still, **internally visualize (内想)** tranquility and repose within it—
diseases will then naturally dissipate, and **yin evils (阴邪)** will retreat.

**Chapter on the Revered Mysteries (玄网篇):**
The **Daoist schools (道家者流)** are vast and boundless,
exploring their profound subtleties,
to grasp their fundamental principles.
The **Revered Mysteries Master (崇玄子)**— surnamed **Tang (唐)**,**Hào (昊)**,**Áo Wù (凹兀)**—
once said:
"The **Dao (道)** arises from the **Non-Being (无)** and gives birth to existence.
The **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** are its manifestation.
**Heaven (天)** is movement,
yet the **North Pole (北辰)** does not shift—
it **embodies the void (含虚)** without depletion.
**Earth (地)** is stillness,
yet the **eastern rivers (东流)** do not stagnate—
they **raise clouds (兴云)** without exhaustion.
Thus, **stillness (静)** is the **heart of Heaven and Earth (天地之心)**,
and **movement (动)** is their **qi (天地之气)**.
When the **heart is still (心静)** and the **qi moves (气动)**,
this is how they **sustain and transform (覆载)** without end.

Those who **penetrate the Dao (通乎道者)**,
keep their **heart tranquil (心宁)** to align with the **Dao (道)**,
and **cultivate their qi (气运)** to preserve their form—
unseduced by things, they are called **Supreme Stillness (至静者)**.
Originally, there is no **spirit (神)**—
when **emptiness reaches its peak (虚极)**, the **spirit arises (神自生)**;
Originally, there is no **qi (气)**—
when the **spirit moves (神运)**, the **qi transforms (气自化)**.
**Qi** has no inherent substance—
it **condenses and coalesces (凝委)** to form shape.
**Form** has no inherent nature—
when it **moves and functions (动用)**, its **nature is depleted (性亏)**.
Thus, what **gives birth to me (生我者)** is the **Dao (道)**,
and what **annihilates me (灭我者)** is **emotion (情)**.
When **emotion is forgotten (情忘)**, **nature is complete (性全)**,
when **nature is complete (性全)**, **form is complete (形全)**,
when **form is complete (形全)**, **qi is complete (气全)**,
when **qi is complete (气全)**, **spirit is complete (神全)**,
when **spirit is complete (神全)**, the **Dao is complete (道全)**,
when the **Dao is complete (道全)**, the **spirit reigns (神王)**,
when the **spirit reigns (神王)**, the **qi is refined (气灵)**,
when the **qi is refined (气灵)**, the **spirit transcends (神超)**,
when the **spirit transcends (神超)**, **nature is perfected (性彻)**,
when **nature is perfected (性彻)**, one **returns and reverses (反覆)**,
flowing **unified with the Dao (通流与道为一)**.
This allows one to **make the "having" into "non-being" (有为无)**,
and the "real" into **emptiness (虚)**—
to stand equal with the **Creator (造物者)**.

The **Dao (道)** does not desire **a fixed mind (有心)**,
for if there is **a fixed mind (有心)**, the **true qi (真气)** will not gather.
It does not desire **a strained will (苦志)**,
for if the **will is strained (苦志)**, **external evils (客邪)** will come and lodge.
It lies in **evenness and tranquility (平和恬淡)**,
**clarity and subtlety (澄静精微)**,
**emptiness and primordial essence (虚明含元)**,
**responsive yet unattached (有感必应)**,
**accepting without grasping (应而勿取)**—
then **true and false are distinguished (真伪斯分)**.
Thus, if my **heart does not incline (心不倾)**,
then all things will be **upright (无不正)**;
if **moving thoughts have their place (动念有属)**,
then all things will be **evil (无不邪)**.
The coming of **evil and rectitude (邪正)** depends on me alone.
Only when **refining the mundane (炼凡)** reaches **immortality (仙)**,
and **refining immortality (炼仙)** reaches **the True (真)**,
and **refining the True (炼真)** merges with **the Marvelous (妙)**,
and **merging with the Marvelous (合妙)** unites with **the Spirit (神)**,
and **Spirit unites with the Dao (神与道合)**,
then the **Dao becomes my body (即道为我身)**—
this is how I **ascend to the Jade Capital (升玉京)**,
**roam the Golden Gate (游金阙)**,
**possessing yet transcending (能有能无)**,
**without beginning or end (不终不段)**.»

The **Revered Mysteries Master (崇玄子)** said:
"I have often stated that **immortality and the spirit (神仙)** have **principles that can be cultivated (可学之理)**.
There are those who **attain without study (不学而自致)**,
endowed with **unique qi (异气)**;
There are those who **must study before achieving (必学而后成)**,
whose **practices are fully realized (功业充)**;
And those who **study yet fail (学而不得)**,
whose **initial diligence wanes (初勤终息)**.
Thus, those **far from immortality (远於仙者)** and those **near to immortality (近於仙者)** each have **seven distinctions (七焉)**.

The **body and qi (形气)** are the **repository of nature (性之府)**—
when the **body and qi (形气)** are destroyed, **nature has no place to reside (性无所存)**,
and if **nature has no place to reside (性无所存)**,
then what **am I (我何有)**?
This is the **first distinction of those far from immortality (远於仙者，一也)**;
Some say **immortality must have limits (仙必有限)**,
and one will **return to decline (归於沦坠)**—
this is the **second distinction of those far from immortality (远於仙者，二也)**;
Some say **the body’s decay is inevitable (形体以败散为期)**,
and **nourishing the vital breath (营魄)** is the means to **regenerate (更生)**—
how do they know of **entering the Great Furnace of Transformation (入造化之洪炉)**,
and **submitting to the refining of yin and yang (任阴阳之鼓铸)**?
This is the **third distinction of those far from immortality (远於仙者，三也)**;
Some say **luxurious titles (轩冕)** bring **fulfillment of desires (得意)**,
and **official honors (功名)** ensure **immortality (不朽)**—
they indulge in **beauty and sound (悦色耽声)**,
**abundant clothing and rich flavors (丰衣厚味)**—
this is the **fourth distinction of those far from immortality (远於仙者，四也)**;
In **times of vigor (强盛之时)**, they are **enslaved by emotional attachments (为情爱所役)**;
when **gray hairs appear (及斑白之后)**, their **studies begin to sprout (习学始萌)**,
yet **injuries remain unhealed (伤残未补)**—
they **covet the name of the Dao (窃慕道之名)**,
while **contradicting its true essence (乖契真之实)**—
this is the **fifth distinction of those far from immortality (远於仙者，五也)**;
They **pursue alchemy with relentless focus (汲汲於炉火)**,
and **study herbs with tireless effort (孜孜於草木)**—
this is the **sixth distinction of those far from immortality (远於仙者，六也)**;
They **violate prohibitions in their actions (动违科禁)**,
and **neglect cultivation in their stillness (静无修习)**—
this is the **seventh distinction of those far from immortality (远於仙者，七也)**.

But those who **indulge in the Dao’s emptiness (耽玄虚)**,
**few in desires (寡嗜欲)**,
**embody Supreme Stillness (体含至静)**,
and **take non-action as their practice (以无为为事)**—
this is the **first distinction of those near to immortality (近於仙者，一也)**;
Those who **plant myriad yin evils (万阴贼)**,
**cultivate yin virtue (植阴德)**,
**restrain anger and reduce desires (惩忿损欲)**,
**equalize praise and blame (齐毁誉)**,
and **refine true purity (修清真)**—
this is the **second distinction of those near to immortality (近於仙者，二也)**;
Those who **dwell in official positions (身居禄位)**,
yet **their hearts roam in virtue and the Dao (心游道德)**,
**practicing benevolence, humility, and harmony (仁慈恭和)**,
and **extending wide and generous love (弘施博爱)**—
this is the **third distinction of those near to immortality (近於仙者，三也)**;
Those who **do not covet titles (爵之不从)**,
nor **treasure wealth (禄之不爱)**,
and **tranquilly focus on preserving life (恬然以摄生为务)**—
this is the **fourth distinction of those near to immortality (近於仙者，四也)**;
Those who **use stillness to stabilize the body (静以安身)**,
**harmony to nurture the spirit (和以养神)**,
and **precision to attain the True (精以致真)**—
this is the **fifth distinction of those near to immortality (近於仙者，五也)**.

「失於壮齿，收之晚节，以功补过，以正易邪，
**When vigor fades in youthful years (壮齿), it is reclaimed in the twilight of life (晚节)**—
to **redeem past faults with merit (功)** and **replace falsehood with rectitude (正)**,
**refining the subtle (微) with precision (精)** and **accumulating it to manifest (成着)**—
this is the **sixth distinction of those near to immortality (近於仙者，六也)**.

忠孝清廉，不待学而自得，
**Loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and incorruptibility (忠孝清廉)**,
**naturally attained without formal study (不待学)**—
this is called **hidden brilliance and latent transformation (隐景潜化)**,
**where death does not extinguish their essence (死而不亡)**—
this is the **seventh distinction of those near to immortality (近於仙者，七也)**.

**To embrace the seven near (取七近) and reject the seven distant (放七远)**,
is to **extract oneself from the mire of suffering (拔陷区) and escape the perilous path (出溺途)**.

玉芝篇
**The Five Great Phases (五太相生)**,
**manifest before all things (在物之先)**,
**clearly foretell the coming (明告来者)**,
**like the hidden treasures of the Dao (犹鱼之荃)**.

The **Zhao Yuanzi (朝元子)** Chen Ju (陈举) said in the **Treasure of the Primordial (宝元中人)**:
**To merge with the root of the Primordial (混元之本)**,
**to follow the pivot of Heaven and Earth (法天地之枢)**—
**establish oneself as the Great Furnace and Vast Cauldron (洪炉大鼎)**,
**to refine one’s True Essence (炼其真焉)**.

**Internally, cultivate the lead and mercury (养铅汞)**,
**externally, embody the trigrams of Li (☲ 離) and Kan (☵ 坎)**—
**harmonize yin and yang (运其阴阳)**,
**command dragons and tame tigers (驱龙驭虎)**,
**to return to the root and restore the Primordial (返本还元)**.

Thus,
**the mystic frost and crimson snow (玄霜绛雪)**,
**the jade elixir and golden salve (玉药金膏)**,
**are ninefold refined into treasure (九转而成宝)**.

**Wei Boyang (魏伯阳) achieved Dao through the Three Refined (参同成道)**,
**Ma Mingcheng (马明生) transcended through Golden Elixir (金液超真)**,
**Yin Changsheng (阴长生) concocted the elixir of Supreme Truth (太真之剂)**,
**and Liu An (刘安) cultivated the Primordial One (太一之元)**—
**this is what is meant by the hidden treasures of the Dao (奥荃者欤)**.

**While the yang soul (阳魂) remains unmanifest (未交)**,
**it is like the dark cavern (玄窟)**.
**Once the yang essence (阳精) begins to take form (既兆)**,
**it then assumes its inherent nature to manifest as substance (禀性以成乎形)**.

Thus,
**yin separates from yang and returns to quiescence (阴判阳而归寂)**,
**while yang dwells within yin and forms materiality (阳寓阴而成质)**.
**When yin and yang unite, all things flourish (阴阳交而万物泰)**;
**when sun and moon coalesce, the four seasons manifest (日月合而四时成)**.

**If Heaven and Earth did not interact (天地不交)**,
**how would day and night arise (何以为昼夜)？**
**If sun and moon did not merge (日月不合)**,
**how would their waxing and waning be known (何以着盈反)？**
**If all things did not unite (万物不合)**,
**how would their display of growth, decay, and change be seen (何以显荣枯)？**

**At the time of the Great Simplicity (太易)**,
**the cosmos is indistinct and hazy (混混蒙蒙)**, like **the embryo in the womb (胞中蒂)**—
**thus arises the meaning of the Great Simplicity’s first spring, the single yang (首春一阳)**.

Its **substance is the dark and luminous (玄黄)**,
**before the four symbols (四象) are distinct**.
**The mystic mist of the Golden Elixir (玄雾乎金液)**,
**the radiant light sealing the Water Spirit (华光锁乎水精)**.
**The night begins at the hour of Zi (子)**, the **initial position of the hidden dragon (初九潜龙)**.

The **Great Simplicity (太易)** is:
**virtue (仁), spring (春), yang (阳), dragon (龙), sun (日), Heaven (天), fire (火), soul (魂), spirit (神), mercury (汞), wood (木)**.
Thus, **yang qi (阳气)**—
**entering things brings life (入乎物日生)**,
**departing things brings death (离乎物曰死)**.
The **Great Simplicity governs life (司生)**.

**If yang does not ascend from below (阳不发於下)**,
**how would all things come to life (则万物何以生哉)？**
Thus, the **Classics say: "Upper Water, Lower Fire" (上水下火)**—
**this refers precisely to this principle**.
**Yang must rise and steam above (必蒸於上)**,
**while yin must moisten below (阴必润於下)**.
**Steaming is its heat (蒸者，其热也)**.
**Heat steams the yin (蒸其阴)**,
**while yin ascends as vapor (阴腾其气)**.
**The light (轻者)** floats upward to become Heaven (上浮而为天)**—
**its clear mists and clouds (清云霞)**,
**its condensed rains and dews (凝雨露)**,
**its dispersed winds and vapors (散风烟)**,
**its cold frosts and snows (寒霜雪)**.
**From Zi (子) to Wu (午), it ascends (升者)**;
**from Wu (午) past Zi (子), it descends (降者)**.

**The clouds, mists, frosts, snows, rains, dews, winds, and vapors (云霞、霜雪、雨露、风烟、气雾)**—
**these are the means by which yin descends to nourish all things (所以降而滋万物者也)**.
The **Classics say: "Return to the root and restore the Primordial, merging with the Earth’s pulse" (返本还元归於地脉)**—
**this is what is meant (此之谓欤)！**

**Within the body, it becomes the fluids (津), the essences (液), the tears (涕), the blood (血), the flesh (肉), the semen (精), and the marrow (髓)**.
**The five metals and eight stones (五金八石)**,
**depend on the rising and descending of Heaven and Earth’s qi (依乎天地之升降)**,
**their transformation and harmonization (运转和合)**,
**and their return to the root essence (归乎本元)**—
**thus, it is called "restoration" (故曰还)**.
**Ninefold refining yields rigidity (九炼成刚)**—
**thus, it is called "elixir" (故曰丹)**.

The **Great Beginning (太初)** is **the origin of Heaven, Earth, and all things (天地万物之初)**.
**When yang and yin first establish form (阴阳得位)**,
**the tiger and dragon are divided (虎龙分)**.
**The clear and turbid qi of Heaven and Earth (清浊之气)**,
**follow the grand keys (崇钥)**, transforming into all things.

This **qi (气)**—
**in the Dao, it is yin and yang (阴阳)**;
**in humans, it is soul and spirit (魂魄)**;
**in things, it is their outer and inner layers (表裹)**;
**in Heaven, it is sun and moon (日月)**;
**on Earth, it is sound and color (声色)**;
**in the elixir field (丹田), it is lead and mercury (铅汞)**.

This **Dao (道)**—
**arises from One (生於一)**,
**One generates Two (一生二)**,
**Two generates Three (二生三)**,
**Three generates all things (三生万物)**,
**and finally returns to One (终於一)**.

Thus, it is said:
**One is water (一者，水也)**;
**Two is fire (二者，火也)**;
**Three is earth (三者，土也)**.
**Are there things that do not thus generate and perish (物有不因此而生灭者)？**
**Water and fire (水火)**—
**each obtains its own singular aspect (各得其一)**.
**Obtaining One (得一)**—
**this is the mother of things (物之母)**,
**the essence of qi (气之精)**,
**the root of life (命之根)**,
**and the progenitor of consciousness (识之祖)**.

The **Heavenly Dao** obtains its **augmented power (威)** through this,
the **Earthly Dao** obtains its **manifested potential (机)** through this.
This is the **progenitor of the Divine (神之祖)**,
the **agent of qi (气之使)**,
the **father of things (物之父)**,
the **controller of the spirit (魂之制)**,
and the **master of the body (身之主)**.

**Water** generates a single male—this is the **Kàn (坎)**, named **mercury (汞)**;
**Fire** generates two females—this is the **Lí (离)**, named **lead (铅)**.
This is called the **Four Symbols (四象)**.

**Mercury (汞)** is the **elixir (丹)**;
**Lead (铅)** is the **medicine (药)**.

The **Heavenly Old Lord (天老神君)** says:
*"Use lead but not mercury,
must first refine within lead,
yet when it comes to using mercury,
using mercury alone is a mistake—how so?"*

**Mercury (汞)** is **yang (阳)**, the **child (子)**;
**Lead (铅)** is **yin (阴)**, the **mother (母)**.
**Mercury (汞)** without **lead (铅)**—
its **singleness (独#1)** lacks the **motherly aspect**—
how then can it generate?

When **lead (铅)** and **mercury (汞)** merge,
and after **three years** they become **treasure (宝)**,
burning away the **lead’s (铅)** impure **qi (气)**—
this is **shedding the shell (脱壳)**,
named **pure yang (纯阳)**.

Thus, *"use lead but not mercury"*—
I have observed the **Great Dao (大道)** does not surpass **yin and yang (阴阳)**,
uniting in the **Central Palace (中宫)**,
where there is **movement (动)** and **stillness (静)**.

**Movement (动)** is **mercury (汞)**, pure and inclined to ascend;
**Stillness (静)** is **lead (铅)**, turbid and reluctant to rise.
When **mercury (汞)** ascends, it aligns with **fire (火)**;
when **lead (铅)** remains still, it aligns with **water (水)**.
**Water (水)** flows and moistens,
**Fire (火)** attracts and dries—
is this not so?

The **Divine (神)** is **life (命)**;
**Stillness (静)** is **nature (性)**.
**Life (命)**—
moves and brings **birth (生)** and **fulfillment (成)**;
**Nature (性)**—
remains still and is **unstained (无染)** and **unattached (无着)**.

Thus, the **three souls (三魂)** return to **Heaven (天)**,
the **seven residues (七魄)** return to **Earth (地)**,
each having its own **source (源)**.

**Tàisù (太素)** is the **foundation (本)**.
When the **foundation (本)** is established, the **Dao (道)** arises.

In the **Tàishǐ (太始)** and **Tàisù (太素)** era,
**hardness (刚)** and **softness (柔)** were distinguished,
to establish the **Three Powers (三才)**,
to manifest the **Four Symbols (四象)**.

**Tàisù (太素)** governs **autumn (秋)**,
the time when **all treasures (万宝)** are formed.
The **classics (经)** say:
*"Fire becomes empty, water becomes void—
this is their **form and symbol (形象)**."*

For instance, a person in the **womb (胎)**,
**yin blood (阴血)** and **yang essence (阳精)**,
mixed and coalescing,
by the **third month** the **yin and yang (阴阳)** separate,
and each attains its own **abode (居)**.

The **mother’s (母)** primordial **role (元职)** is in the **muddy origin (泥元)**,
named the **sea of blood (血之海)**;
The **father’s (父)** primordial **mastery (元主)** is in the **yin position (阴位)**,
below the **navel (脐下)**,
named the **sea of qi (气之海)**.

Their **divine qi (神气)** intermingles,
named the **Three Powers (三才)**.
The **harmonizing (冲)** and **balancing (和)** **qi (气)** follows the mother’s **breathing (呼吸)**,
responding to her **upward and downward (上下)** flow.
When the **Three Powers (三才)** are complete, all things **grow (长)**.

The **mother’s (母)** primordial **mastery (元主)**—
**blood (血)**, **flesh (肉)**, **essence (精)**, **marrow (髓)**, **will (意)**, **residue (魄)**—
is my **lead (铅)**, the **tiger (虎)**;
The **father’s (父)** primordial **mastery (元主)**—
**sinews (筋)**, **bones (骨)**, **heart (心)**, **soul (魂)**—
is my **mercury (汞)**, the **dragon (龙)**.
By the **fifth month**, form is nearly complete,
and the **outer and inner layers (表裹)** are divided.

My **transformation and nurturing (化育)**—
is this not just like this?

The **Yang elixir (阳丹)** is **essence (精)**;
The **Yin elixir (阴丹)** is **blood (血)**.
When the **Southern Sun reaches its zenith (日南至)**,
it marks the **beginning of one yang (一阳之始)**, the **hidden dragon’s position (潜龙之位)**.
Await the retreat of **five yin (五阴)** as **yang ascends (阳升)**.
The **eleventh month, twelfth month, and first month**—
these are the **times of three yang (三阳之时)**, when all things **sprout (芽)**.
Is not my **refinement of form (炼形)** also thus?

**"Three thousand" of attainment (功盈三千)**, what does it mean?
To ingest the elixir for **a thousand days (服丹千日)** is **three years (三年)**.
It is like the **three months of spring within the elixir**—
in three years, the **two qi (二气)** are fully manifested.
**Transform my mortal frame (易吾之躯)** into the **natural body (自然之体)**,
circulating **water and fire**, merging **mercury and lead (交汞铅)** through **nine transformations (九转)**.
**Nine transformations (九转)** are **nine years (九年)**.
**Nine times nine (九九)** is the **completion of numbers (数之盈)**.
Within **nine years**, there are **nine changes (九易)**:
The **first year** refines **qi (易气)**,
the **second year** refines **blood (易血)**,
the **third year** refines **vessels (易脉)**,
the **fourth year** refines **flesh (易肉)**,
the **fifth year** refines **marrow (易髓)**,
the **sixth year** refines **sinews (易筋)**,
the **seventh year** refines **bones (易骨)**,
the **eighth year** refines **hair (易发)**,
the **ninth year** refines **form (易形)**.
Those **aspiring to the Dao (志於道者)**—
how could they fail to examine this?

To **abandon this and seek the Dao (舍是而求道者)** is like the **blind pursuing a hare (瞽者逐兔)**.

The **Yellow Emperor (黄帝)** said:
*"I possess the **Returning Elixir (还丹)**, sevenfold in its kind (其品七焉):*
**saliva (津)**, **marrow (髓)**, **blood (血)**, **spittle (唾)**, **essence (精)**, **qi (气)**, **spirit (神)**.
Thus, I speak of **water, fire, lead, and mercury (指水、火、铅、汞)** as metaphors.
**Saliva (津)** is **mercury (汞)**,
**essence (精)** is **lead (铅)**.

**Water** dwells in the **brain (脑中)**,
**fire** resides in the **lower abdomen (脐下)**.
Circulate **lead to govern mercury (运铅以制汞)**,
refine **mercury to return to lead (炼汞以投铅)**,
coming and going, returning to the source—
**water and fire are thus harmonized (水火正矣)**.

The **Great Ultimate (太极)** is the **end of heaven, earth, and all things (天地万物之终)**.
Thus it is said:
The **Great Ease (太易)** is **water (水)**;
The **Great Beginning (太初)** is **wood (木)**;
The **Great Commencement (太始)** is **fire (火)**;
The **Great Substance (太素)** is **metal (金)**;
The **Great Ultimate (太极)** is **earth (土)**.
All things **are born and die in earth (生死於土)**.

**One yang** first **stirs in the eleventh month (子十一月)**.
In the **Book of Changes (易)**, it begins with **Kǎn (复)**,
then **Lín (临)**, **Tài (泰)**, **Dà Zhuàng (大壮)**, and **Fù (夫)**—
**Qián (乾)** is the **apex of yang numbers (阳数之极)**.
**One yin** first **stirs in the fifth month (午五月)**.
In the **Book of Changes**, it begins with **Shēn (娠)**,
then **Huán (还)**, **Pǐ (否)**, **Guān (观)**, and **Bò (剥)**—
**Kūn (坤)** is the **apex of yin numbers (阴数之极)**.
This is the **symbol of one year (一岁之象)**.

**One month (一月)** is also the **symbol of one year (一岁之象)**,
**one day (一日)** is also the **symbol of one month (一月之象)**—
all bear the **numbers of yin, yang, and the Five Phases (阴阳五行之数)** within them.

No thing reaches **eighth or ninth month (八月、九月)** without completion—
thus, my **elixir has nine transformations (九转)**.

Who is not the result of **yin and yang combining (阴阳合)**?
The **sun with a crow (日有乌)** is **yin (阴)**;
The **moon with a hare (月有兔)** is **yang (阳)**.

From the **first to the eighth day of the moon (一日至八日)**,
its name is **upper arc (上弦)**, **192 *cùn* (一百九十有二铢)**—
**gold and water balanced (金水平分)**.
Its name is **"one-eight" (一八)**, the **division of spring (春之分)**.
Its time belongs to **Mao (卯)**, called **lead (铅)**, **192 *cùn* (一百九十有二铢)**.
By the **sixteenth day (旬有六日)**, **yang reaches its peak (阳数极)** and **brightens (而明)**,
then **one yin arrives (一阴至)** and **yang retreats (阳退)**.

After the **sixteenth day**, it **wanes until the twenty-third day (亏至二旬有三日)**,
its name is **lower arc (下弦)**, also **192 *cùn* (一百九十二铢)**—
**dragon and tiger balanced (龙虎中分)**.
It is also called **"one-eight" (一八)**, the **division of autumn (秋之分)**.
Its time belongs to **Yǒu (酉)**, called **mercury (汞)**, **192 *cùn* (一百九十有二铢)**.
By the **twenty-fourth day (二旬有四日)**, **yin is at its height (阴盛)** and **yang declines (阳衰)**,
the **sun and moon are exhausted (日月尽)**, and **yin reaches its limit (阴极)**.

**Yang** and **yin**—
do they not **end and begin anew (终而复始)**?
Thus, **eight days** are **192 *cùn* (一百九十有二铢)**,
and **sixteen days** are **384 *cùn* (三百八十有四铢)**.
A **jīn (斤)** produces **16 liǎng (两)**, a **liǎng** is **four fēn (分)**.
Thus, **384 *cùn* (三百八十有四铢)** corresponds to the **numbers in the Great Ease (大易之策数)**.

A **year’s days (一岁之日)**—their **qi (气)** and **climates (候)**—are **twenty-four (二十有四)**,
thus **complete (备矣)**.
Counting their **divisions (分)** as **sixty-four (六十有四)**,
these are also the **lines of the sixty-four hexagrams (卦之爻)** in the **Great Ease**.
**Six lines per hexagram (六爻)**, **four hexagrams (四卦)**, totaling **384 lines (凡三百八十有四爻)**—
they align with the **numbers of the Great Ease (易之策数)**,
and they also align with **human breathing (人之息数)**.

Thus, **fire is kindled from Zi (子) to Wu (午)**, six hours—
**yang (阳)**, its symbol **spring and summer (春夏)**;
From **Wu (午) to Zi (子)**, six hours—
**yin (阴)**, its symbol **autumn and winter (秋冬)**.
Even within **one day (一日之内)**,
the **sequential movements of heaven, earth, sun, moon, and stars (天地日月星辰)** are fully present—
**twenty-four qi (二十四气)**, **seventy-two seasonal divisions (七十二候)** are all complete.
Thus, my **Dao cannot be neglected in any one aspect (废一而为之者)** and still succeed.

Why must **fire be kindled at Zi (子)**?
To **harness yang qi (承阳气)** and **ignite the fire (起火)**—
only then is its **power complete (火力斯全)**.
Beyond **Zi (子)**, **yin predominates (阴盛)** and **fire falters (火不然)**.
Thus it is said: **"Water overcomes fire (水克火)"**.

**Fire (火)** is not the **fire of the heart (心之火)**.
The **heart (心)** is the **spirit (神)**.
I have the **central furnace (中宫之鼎)** beneath the heart,
so when the **heart is fire (心为火)**, it is **consumption (焚)**—
**fire above the furnace (火在鼎之上)**.
The **Classic** says:
*"Fire arises from below the navel (火起於脐下),
water emerges from the furnace (水出於鼎中)"*—
the **accomplished (既济)** symbol.
**Water above, fire below (上水下火)**.

This **furnace (鼎)**—
when the time reaches **Mao (卯)**, **lead increases (增铅)**;
when the time reaches **Yǒu (酉)**, **mercury increases (增汞)**.
**Lead without fire does not ascend (铅不得火则不腾)**,
**mercury without lead does not solidify (汞不得铅则不凝)**.
The **Classic** says:
*"Take water from the mountain (取水於山),
ignite fire from the sea (起火於海),
extract mercury from the high tower (取汞於重楼),
gather lead from the ninth heaven (采铅於九天)"*—
its **circulation (运)** is **complete in the four seasons (备乎四时)**.
**Align with spirit (与神御之)**, **harmonize with qi (与气和之)**—
then the **four symbols (四象)** are complete,
and the **central furnace (中宫之鼎)** resembles a **magpie (鹦子)**.
In **three years (三年)**, **red and white are distinguished (赤白判)** and the **body is exchanged (换躯)**.

**Golden intestines and jade bones (金肠玉骨)** emerge from the **Five Phases (五行)**,
their name is **shedding (蜕)**.
Thus, the **four symbols merge (四象交)** and **mercury is purified (汞乾)**,
**yang is complete (一阳备)** and **lead is eliminated (铅去)**—
its name is the **Returning Elixir (还丹)**.
Then the **spirit and soul stand firm (神魂立)**,
and the **body becomes unyielding (其体刚矣)**.

**Three Flowers into One, Five Colors Return to Yang—**
this is called the **Uncultivated Realm**.

The **Chao Yuan Zi** once composed a song of it, sixty verses in total.
When the **You Zi** read them, he exclaimed:
*"Profound! The depths of the Great Dao!"*
Now I reveal them plainly.

**The *Direct Meaning*** says:
*"Two greens must be paired with four yellows, ground together—
all transformations are but the natural union.
To make the Three Pure Ones return to One Chamber,
you must rely on the Cloud-Rain to circulate the Three Fields.
To the south, blood is mercury from the sand,
to the north, essence is lead from the water.
This is the law of the Great Luo Heaven—
once recognized, one becomes an Immortal."*

**The *Alchemical Prescriptions*** say:
*"Within the Central Plain, the two or three households of Chonghe
produce gold, silver, mercury, and sand.
The radiant spirit-plant grows on Ling Mountain’s peaks,
the noble wavelike flowers bloom in the purple mists.
From the ninth heaven’s heights, the Primordial Fire is born,
and in the three-tiered furnace, the treasure-carriage ascends.
The mysteries are clear and profound—
no further arcane wonders need be boasted."*

**The *Winter Solstice*** says:
*"Li and Kan alternate, and I can fathom them—
beneath the five yins, the Qian Dragon lies.
The Yang Symbol advances and retreats, high then low,
the Returning Hexagram adds and subtracts, single and double.
All day, the noon hour marks the start of summer,
each night after the hour of Zi brings the new winter.
Do not say Heaven, Earth, and Man are unfathomable—
the *Zhou Yi* clearly reveals its fundamental intent."*

**The *Path of Attainment*** says:
*"How could the Bagua’s departure be delayed?
Two paths diverge to the edge of Heaven—
within Li, the Geng-Xin lands lie,
and within Yin, the Jia-Yi flowers bloom.
The Three Scenes follow the crimson-crested crane’s clouds,
the Five Directions’ winds summon the Purple River Car.
Beneath Kunlun’s peaks, the burning place—
a single beam of light-wind leads to the Mother’s abode."*

**The *Mysterious Female*** says:
*"The central peak, towering, aligns sun and moon,
while Qian and Kun’s branches and leaves thrive in Ling Xi’s stream.
The tortoise and serpent coil in dual segments,
wind and rain drench the banks, one field of water.
Within the furnace, the ministers are named Zi and Wu,
in the cauldron, the husband and wife are called Shu and Xi."*

**The *Child-Mother*** says:
*"Within one, another one—how could this be spoken?
The Three Realms arise from a single source.
In the Red Stone Cavern, the Holy Mother hides,
On the Vermilion Palace Platform, the Divine Grandson appears.
Within the Jade Pool’s waves, the true cinnabar-mercury glows,
Before the White Jade Peak, the murmuring clouds drift.
This is the Origin of Heaven and Earth—
The world’s fools would never hear of such things."*

**The *Mother’s Visage*** says:
*"The Vermilion Gate and Jade Palace already stand in peace,
Gazing upon the construction of the Purple-Gold Citadel.
Rain and wind extinguish the Three Fires,
Thunder and lightning drive back the Five Essences.
Black qi fades with the mist’s dispersal,
The elixir’s first taste rises with the clouds.
Though the work is not yet fully perfected,
One knows to register among the Celestial Court’s names."*

**The *Purple River Car*** says:
*"Mingled winds and white qi descend,
The Golden Mother descends to Penglai’s expanse.
The Snowy Peaks’ Three Passes open,
The Celestial Streets’ two paths extend.
The Elixir Hall’s court assembles the Emperor,
The Watery Realm accompanies the Sacred Infant.
Nine times nine, frost and snow descend,
Yang light pervades the Purple City."*

**The *Dao/Way’s Release*** says:
*"The mysteries of Primordial Transformation are hard to fathom,
The Golden Earth’s teachings run even deeper.
Dragon and Tiger have long given birth to the Four Seas,
The Golden Just Ones originally dwell in the Twin Forests.
The Yang Soul stands alone, preserving life,
The Yin Nature ascends alone, transcending the mortal heart.
Endless flow yet none comprehend—
Willing to be like water-bubbles in rise and fall."*

**The *Joy of the Dao/Way*** says:
*"A myriad vain labors plague this body,
Here, subtle signs communicate with the divine.
Sometimes, the Golden Phoenix dances on the mountain’s peak,
At night, the Qí-flowers bloom across the sea’s face.
Valley qi of the Five Phases all become earth,
The Yang elixir transcends the kalpas, leaving no dust.
Each morning, only seek those of like mind,
To meet the Bundled Void—no one else remains."*

*«The *Ritual of the Altar*» says:
*"To build the altar, no earth nor ash is used,
Creation relies entirely on the **Homogeneous Elixir** as the mediator.
The bitter mists condense into frost, Yin conceives the **Mercury**,
Light clouds enfold the snow, Fire births the **Primordial Embryo**.
When the threefold work is complete, the Three Realms are divided,
When the fivefold talents are perfected, the Five Peaks are revealed.
Refinement must follow this method alone,
Do not let the filth of dust disturb the **Divine Embryo**."*

*«The *Fetal Breath*» says:
*"Faint and yet profound, the Void is both white and pure,
Harmonized and clear—returning to the **Root of the Original**.
The Three **Mercuries** return to their **Native Realm**,
The myriad **Sprouts** are gathered back to the **Bundled Void**.
Yang coalesces, Yin forms the **Symbol of the Embryo**,
The **Golden Phoenix** flourishes, Fire takes shape.
Who can match this work?
A thousand days fill the **Divine Essence**."*

*«The *Two Eights*» says:
*"Graceful and refined, the **Two Eights** of windy elegance,
Husband and wife rejoice, united in bliss.
**Layered** and **Mysterious** divide Yin and Yang,
**Mao** and **You** equally share the **upper and lower arcs**.
The **White Beast** hides at the start, like the **Tiger’s Den**,
The **Green Dragon** rests at full moon, in **Dragon’s Sleep**.
[Original text missing two lines]

*«The *Divine Water*» says:
*"The enlightened ruler’s **Dao/Way** clears all lands,
With one stroke, the Yellow River reaches the **Boundless Void**.
All **Dharmas** are upheld by the **Celestial Sovereigns**,
The Three **Talents** revere their **Root in the Bundled Darkness**.
The **Black Pearl** subjugates the **Homogeneous Elixir** in the **Palace of the Void**,
The **Red Elixir** circulates in the **Court of the Great Ultimate**.
If one does not awaken in a hundred years, how many days will pass?
Willingly follow the **Five Thieves**, letting the body run wild."*

*«The *Original Dao/Way*» says:
*"The Dao/Way that establishes Heaven is fixed in the human form,
It never departs from **lead, cinnabar, mercury, and silver**.
The **Metal Horse** gallops back in the **Mountain’s Rain**,
The **Earth Ox** plows forth in the **Palace’s Spring**.
Within the **Celestial Sovereign’s Hall**, the Three **Qi** are attuned,
In the **Martial Furnace**, the Four **Divine Agents** are nurtured.
Even the greatest talents cannot fathom this alone,
**Confucius** himself still questions the **Fisherman**."*

*«The *Pairing*» says:
*"The **Two Eights** of windy elegance meet once more,
This night’s joyful reunion carries heavy **auspicious qi**.
Husband and wife return to sleep in the **Green Canopy**,
The **Bubbling Phoenix** resumes its **White Geng-Dragon** stride.
Together they feast on the **congealed essence of the Azure Clouds**,
Their union blooms beyond the **jade-like form of the Celestial Phoenix**.
Who knows who first initiated this?
Let us join Heaven and Earth in this shared **principle**."*

*«The *Seven Returns*» says:
*"The **Mother** moves alone in her **camp**,
The **Wind and Clouds** welcome only after her passage.
She cycles through the **Five Sacred Peaks**,
Ascending step by step to the **Three Pure Ones**.
She dwells in the **Southern Water of the Ninefold Return**,
Gathering the **Seven Flavors of the Embryo’s Essence**.
With the **Ninefold Return**, the work is complete in a day,
The **body of the Celestial Phoenix** weighs but **six liang** and is light."*

*«The *Manifest Dao/Way*» says:
*"Once the **principle** is attained, all is effortless,
Residing in **thoughts of tranquility**, nurturing **Nature’s Spontaneity**.
The **Three Flowers** fade, leaving the **Pure Land**,
The **Seven Treasures** are gathered to sow the **Field of the Embryo**.
Life and death are all **Dao/Way**—rooted in Heaven and Earth,
**Vitality** and **destiny** belong to **mercury and lead**.
This method should lead to the **Dao/Way’s Path of the Elixir**,
'Four **Eclipses**—when the day comes, let the body turn to dust."*

*«The *Forging the Cauldron*» says:
*"Rabbit marrow and crow liver, one **jin** in measure,
Enclosed in the **Heaven-Earth Furnace**, refined into the **True Elixir**.
The **Green Dragon** nourishes with **snowy milk** to strengthen sinew and bone,
The **Red Elixir** blooms flowers to forge the **Cauldron’s Body**.
Within its **three legs**, the **Three Worlds** are divided,
Its **double tiers** encase the **Celestial Stars**.
Common folk do not recognize the **method of longevity**,
Yet they say: ‘Forging the elixir is not the true way.’"*

*«The *Fire’s Temperament*» says:
*"At the initial **nine**, Yang arrives from midnight,
The **Whale’s Breath** pierces the **Penglai Sea** within.
The **Twelvefold City** enfolds the **Dragon Chariot’s Return**,
Before the **Twelve Palaces**, the **Tiger’s Steed** wheels back.
A **jin** of sun and moon becomes the **Great Medicine**,
Two **jin** of Heaven and Earth first form the **Embryo**.
Clearly measure the **Heavenly Cycle’s Count**,
Do not let **erroneous timing** or **false incantations** rush the process."*

*«The *Mind’s Method*» says:
*"Again, it belongs to **South Without** and to **Yellow**,
Before the gate, the **Two Golden Trees** stand tall.
All myriad **afflictions** are born from the mind’s creation,
The **Seven Thieves** must perish by the **sword of insight**.
The **Mind’s Essence** enfolds the **Wisdom-Light Boat**,
Within **Zen**, the **Ancestral Seal** shines like frost in day.
When the **Single Essence** reaches the shore, abandon the **Mind’s Method**,
Only then is one called **Liberation’s Fragrant Incense**."*

*«The *Union of the Dao/Way*» says:
*"The **Wondrous Woman** lies in the **lonely pavilion**,
**Liu Lang** arrives at midnight’s hour.
East and west, **celestial mists** arise,
Above and below, **rain-winds** follow in turn."*

*«The *Alchemical Refining*» says:
*"Tame the three forms of **mercury**,
Harmonize the five little ones;
After a thousand days of **Divine Elixir**,
The husband and wife shall part in two."*

*«The *Furnace Has a Gate*» says:
*"At the Five Aggregates Mountain’s white jade peak,
The **Green Sovereign**’s branches and leaves dwell within.
Towering waves arise, **Dragon** moves the rain,
**Zhūróng**’s **cloud-winds** follow the **Tiger’s** roar.
Two currents of **jade-green** flow intertwined above and below,
Two **solar** eclipses return east and west;
Before one’s eyes, the **Dao/Way** is plainly pointed out,
Yet doubt and grasping cling to the **void** all too long."*

*«The *Three-Five Cycle*» says:
*"The Great Sky hangs its **cosmic symbols** to meet **Kunlun**,
The Eight Trigrams first divide at **child’s hour** and **midnight**;
The Three Realms arise from **True Martial Fire**,
The Five Talismans rise and fall with **Zhūróng Sovereign**.
The **Black Dragon** exhales mist—**river-pool rains**,
The **Red Sovereign** brings spring—**mountain-altar clouds**;
If one does not seek within this truth,
One sweetly follows the **sensual chaos** in vain."*

*«The *Dao/Way’s Mechanism*» says:
*"Leisurely riding the **Earth-Horse** through lands and streams,
One traverses **Heaven** and **Earth** as if in a glance;
**Black-Faced Night-Demon** drives the **White Tiger**,
**Green-Haired Talisman** commands the **Red Tortoise** to gather near.
Two **sheng** of **sea-water** nourish the Three Realms,
A six-**cùn** porcelain bottle stacks the Nine Heavens;
When one grasps this truth, it is truly **self-sufficient**,
Yet who shall **measure and weigh** it to the **profound Dao/Way’s** depths?"

*«The *Dao/Way’s Virtue/Power*» says:
*"To depart from **Kàn (Abyss)** is the root of the **Primordial**,
The surging **Zhào** (creative transformation) holds **quán** (authority) as the One.
**Húnyīn** (undifferentiated darkness) is called **Upper Virtue/Power**,
**Xiān Tiān** (Primordial Heaven) is named **Lower Virtue/Power**.

When the **Mother** is strong, the **Child** must respond,
**Mercury** (Gǒng) dries as **Lead** (Qiān) selflessly yields.
**Dān Yáng** (Cinnabar) can undergo **nine transformations**,
Embracing the **One** to become an **Immortal**.

*«The *Jade Terrace of Golden Gates*» says:
*"On **Kūn Lún** (Kunlun) Mountain’s peak stand the Three Officials,
Who sever the **Heavenly Ford**—asking of both above and below.
A cluster of pavilions where **Dragons** emerge and vanish,
Two forked paths where **Phoenixes** return and wheel.
The **Harmonizing Hall** enfolds the **Principles of Yin and Yang**,
Within the **Twelve Terraces**, **Life-Force** and **Destiny** drift at ease.
If one does not here **fathom the creative transformation**,
They’ll be ensnared by **thoughts** in the **human realm**’s whirl."

*«The *Spiritual Primordial Realm*» says:
*"A single spark of **jīngyīng** (luminous essence) divides the **Black** (darkness),
Two tiers of streets gleam with **Buddha’s** gold and silver.
The entire city, **Dragon** and **Tiger** roam the **Three Realms**,
Their **beards** encircle the **Ten Thousand Folk** as the nation turns.
**Limitless Immortals** all gather in the **Cauldron**,
The **Great Thousand Worlds** never stray from one’s own body.
Yet if one truly **penetrates** the **inner dharma**,
To seek **Truth** outside is but **dust** to the mind.

*«The *Three in One*» says:
*"From the **heart of waves** emerges the **Five Phases**,
**Heaven** and **Earth** naturally **fulfill** their cycles.
**Fēn Fù** (fragrant fields) span **three sections**,
**Chéng Qīng** (pure waters) gather in **one pool**.
**Rise and fall** both rest in **Soil**,
**Returning to Nature** is but **Gēng** (the seventh Heavenly Stem).
Few **know** this as I do,
**Forgetting contrivance**—do not **display** it recklessly!"

*«The Nine Cauldrons»* says:
The sages and worthies manifest **forms** to embody **human relations**,
Yet never stray from the **true essence** veiled in **yang-yin**’s embrace.
All things are forged in **Heaven’s** water, refined in **Earth’s** embrace—
The **Five Phases** rise and fall like **spring** in the **Sea’s** deep heart.

The **Yellow Emperor’s** **Great Cold** roots in **Primordial Soil**,
While the **Great Sage’s** **Twin Pines** symbolize the **body’s** own form.
To **return** yet cannot **reclaim** the **original place**,
Endlessly **entering and emerging** in the **mire of delusion**.

*«The Joy of the Dao»* says:
I envy not nobles’ wealth or splendor’s display,
But cherish the **Supreme Path** as my life’s true way.
Each meal, I pluck **Queen Mother’s** garden’s fruit,
Silently watching **Jade Emperor’s** flowers bloom in the **cave’s** seclusion.

The **Sun** beneath the **water** is **Kui’s** **Wood-Fire**,
The **lead** within the **Soil** is the **Purple River’s** **elixir**.
The **busy world’s** fools, so lost in dust,
Would scarcely believe the **Heavenly Path** is not distant.

*«The Great Sea»* says:
The **Four Obscurities** name the **Four Great Elements**,
A million transformations merge with **Heaven’s** divine will.
**Fire** flickers on the **water’s** surface at **three watches**,
**Spring** blooms in the **pond’s** depths at **midnight’s** hour.

The **tides** surge from the **Tortoise’s** **mouth** in waves,
A **single rain** opens the **Sea Gate’s** **ford**.
This **Dao** few truly **know**—
How many grasp its **truth**?

*«The Nine Heavens»* says:
**Yin-Yang** unfolds the **Ninefold** **Heavenly Gates**,
All existing in the **common person’s** very **body**.
The **Earthly Horse** births **Mystic Lady’s** **Fire**,
The **Iron Ox** plows, turning the **Black Tortoise’s** **soul**.
Driven back into the **tail’s** **cavern**, flames link to the **void**,
Hurled into the **Heavenly Crossroads**, they **soar** upward.
This is the **foundation of life**, **Heaven’s** and **Earth’s** treasure—
Now **fuse the Tortoise and Hare** to **complete the cosmos**.

*«The Three Pure Ones’ Hall»* says:
**Heaven** and **Earth** in **harmonious balance**,
A **palace** of **seven treasures** in **jewel-crafted** splendor.
The **Two Principles** contain **ten thousand transformations**,
One **qi** threads the **Three Pure Ones** as one.
**Rain** descends upon the **mountain’s** peak,
**Clouds and mists** rise from the **sea’s** expanse.
**Golden Elixir** divides into **nine grades**,
**Divine inspiration** naturally **fulfills** its form.

*«The Flowering Pool»* says:
The **Holy Mother** rides the **River Chariot**,
Journeying through **Brahman’s** and **Buddha’s** **realms**.
The **Phoenix** circles, **rising** in **pair**,
The **Five Clouds** swirl, **twisting** in **grace**.
The **Earth’s Axis** pivots from the **Autumn Stone**,
The **Heavenly Wheel** grinds **rainbow-hued** **mists**.
If one cannot **grasp** this **principle**,
Where shall they **seek** the **Yellow Sprout**?

*«The Pointing to the Dao»* says:
**Being and Non-being** are the **Kàn-Lí** **essence’s** core—
Truly, the **Huang Family’s** **Way** is thus **complete**.
All things’ **origin** stems from **Kun’s** **Earth**,
The **Three Thousand Schools** spring from **Jǐng’s** **lineage**.
The **Phoenix** hides in the **south**, **green** within **white**,
The **Dragon** sleeps in the **north**, **black** within **bright**.
But if one **penetrates** **yin-yang’s** **manifesting** **transformations**,
The **common body** naturally **lightens**, **pure**.

*«The Unbounded Dao»* says:
I tend my **fields**, sowing **wheat** and **hemp**,
Then ride my **willed steed** past the **Three Vehicles**.
With **outstretched hands**, I greet the **Heavenly Worthy’s** **abode**,
Where **ten thousand things** are born in the **Mother’s** **domain**.
The **Fire-Horn** **Ox Brother** swallows the **Water-Tiger**,
The **Snow-Maned Lion** bears **golden sand**.

「But one must recognize the **true** **lead-mercury** (*zhen qian-hong*),[^1]
And match them, so that **inch-long sprouts** (*cun ya*)[^2] may burst forth at every moment.

*«The Art of Application»* says:
Last night, the **golden Phoenix** (*jin feng*) descended upon the **high mulberry** (*gao wu*),[^3]
Sleeping and embracing the **black Tortoise** (*li long*) within its mouth—**pearls** (*zhu*).
The **luminous body** (*guang ti*) rises from the **emerald pond** (*bi tan*) like **red waves** (*hong lang*),[^4]
Its **shadow** (*ying*) follows the **cold snow** (*han xue*), spreading **white gold** (*bai jin*)[^5] across the ground.
A **gentle breeze** (*qing feng*) scatters **three petals** (*hua san duo*) of flowers,
And **white milk** (*bai ru*)[^6] is refined into a **pitcher of wine** (*jiu yi hu*).
From this point onward, the **Elixir Platform** (*dan tai*) has a path to return—
**Fourfold darkness** (*si ming*)[^7] another day, let it endure **scorching decay** (*jiao ku*).

*«Nature and Life»* says:
The **A-type Tortoise** (*jia long*) belongs to the **fire** (*huo*) and **Kun’s** **Earth** (*kun di*),
The **Geng-type Tiger** (*geng hu*) is called **transformative talent** (*zao hua cai*).
There is **movement** (*you dong*) and **flight** (*you fei*)—the **true grandmother** (*zhen lao nu*),
No **growth** (*wu zeng*) nor **decay** (*wu zang*)—she is named **Thus-Come** (*Ru Lai*).
When **yin** (*yin*) is consumed, **pure yang** (*chun yang*) begins—
At **stillness** (*xiang ji*), she transcends the **six realms of rebirth** (*liu qu tai*).
The **ancestral Buddha** (*zu fo*) and **ancestral Immortal** (*zu xian*) are thus attained,
All returning to this **principle** (*li*), emerging from **dust** (*chen ai*).

*«True and False»* says:
Awaken to the **mystic black-and-yellow** (*xuan huang*)[^8] **transformative form** (*zao hua shen*),
Do not vainly seek **external** (*wai*) **divine** (*tong shen*)[^9] elsewhere.
**Yin-yang** (*yin-yang*) are not borrowed from others’ **figures** (*ta ren wu*),
**Dragon** (*long*) and **Tiger** (*hu*) must rely on **one’s own treasures** (*zi ji zhen*).
**Soul-nourishing elixirs** (*ling yao*) enter the body, harmonizing with **sun and moon** (*ri yue*),
**Cinnabar** (*dan sha*)[^10] refined by **fire** (*jing huo*) turns to **ash and dust** (*jie chen*).
After **nine years** (*jiu nian*), it returns without error—
Refined into **pure yang** (*chun yang*), it becomes the **Supreme Truth** (*zhi zhen*).

*«Returning to One»* says:
From the start, **pointing to the Dao** (*zhi dao*) is **not the Dao** (*fei dao*),
All talk of **yin-yang** (*yin-yang*) is but **transformative expedience** (*zao hua quan*).
Nurturing the **embryonic form** (*pao tai*)[^11] requires **ten moons** (*shi yue*),
Burning and refining **elixir** (*dan yao*) spans **three thousand days** (*san qian*).
The **five elements’** (*wu xing*) **sprouts and dregs** (*ya zi*) all return to **Earth** (*tu*),
The **seven spirits’** (*qi po*) **yin-winds** (*yin feng*)[^12] dissolve into **Heaven** (*gān*).
When the **work** (*gong*) attains **pure yang** (*chun yang*), it is called **embracing One** (*bao yi*),
Riding the **Dragon** (*long*) to **fly into the Great Luo Heaven** (*da luo tian*).

*«The Dao’s Source»* says:
One **soul** (*ling*)[^13] **originates** (*yuan chan*) within a **single herb** (*yi zhi zhong*),
Revealing **nature** (*xing*)—**four kinds** (*si lei*)[^14] in the **West** (*xi fang*).
Beneath the **sea**, the **Tiger** (*hu*) and **Dragon** (*long*) divide **day and night** (*fen zhou ye*),
In the **clouds**, the **male and female** (*nan nv*) are named **Western Bundles** (*xi shu*).
The **male** (*nan*) dwells in the **Northern Sea** (*bei hai*), **blue-green** (*qing zang*) within **white** (*bai*),
The **female** (*nv*) resides in the **Southern Mountain** (*nan shan*), **black** (*hei*) reflecting **red** (*ying hong*).
From this place, **ten thousand saints** (*wan sheng*) and **thousand sages** (*qian xian*) are attained,
All returning to this **ground** (*ci di*), merging into the **true void** (*he chen kong*).

*«The Five Elements Generating Each Other»* says:
One **thing** (*wu*) divides into **five forms** (*wu ban xing*),
Five **forms** (*wu ban*)[^15] of **refined essence** (*jing cai*) and **five kinds of sentiment** (*wu ban qing*).
The **green Dragon** (*qing long*) is originally the **golden son** (*jin gong zi*),
The **white Tiger** (*bai hu*) was once the **astonished daughter** (*jia nv xiong*).
The **four symbols** (*si xiang*)[^16] are arranged within **Kun’s** **Earth** (*kun di*),
The **central heavens** (*zhong tian*)[^17] **nourish** (*ji fang*) within **Jǐng’s** **lineage** (*bing jia sheng*).
The **great elixir** (*da dan*) leans chiefly on the **power of the golden flower** (*jin hua li*),
It must rely on the **virtuous mediator** (*liang mei*)[^18] for **harmonious completion** (*pi pei cheng*).

*«The Five Elements Conquering Each Other»* says:
The **Great Dao** (*da dao*) is **mysterious and profound** (*you xuan miao fu wei*),
The **five elements** (*wu xing*) **reciprocally generate** (*xiang fan*) their **threatening might** (*ge sheng wei*).
The **envoy of the South** (*nan fang shi*) originally wears **black** (*pi hei*),
The **general of the North** (*bei mian jiang jun*)[^19] **boldly** (*da zhe*) **dons the white** (*ying hei*).
**Kun’s** **female** (*kun nv*) slays her **husband** (*sha fu*),[^20] **yet he submits** (*fu shun fu*),
**Metal** (*gān*) conquers **Wood** (*mu*), **yet Wood returns** (*mu gui yi*).
If **mystic black-and-yellow** (*xuan huang*)[^21] **do not unite** (*wu jiao he*),
How could **yang** (*yang*) **ever rise from the abyss** (*kan*)[^22] and **fly** (*xia fei*)?

*«The Furnace and Tortoise»* says:
The **furnace and tortoise** (*lu ao*) are divided into **two heavenly qi** (*liu qian er qi jun*),
**Cyclic** (*xun huan*) **flow** (*shui*) **above and below** (*shang xia*), connecting their **source** (*jie yuan*).
**Forest and Grove** (*sen luo*)[^23] **irrigate** (*gai guan*) the **three fields** (*san tian*), overflowing—
Only when **congealed** (*ning jie*) does it form the **four seas** (*si hai*) in **oneness** (*hun*).
Within the **twenty-eight** (*er ba*)[^24] **body**, **transformative talent** (*zao hua*) is divided,
In **one pound** (*yi jin*) of **medicine** (*yao*), **Heaven and Earth** (*gān kūn*) are refined.
Boiling and frying require **the waters of Hua Pool** (*hua chi shui*),
When the **rain is sudden** (*yu zou*), **purchase the lotus** (*lei mai*) to **return** (*gui fan*) to the **ancestral home** (*gu yuan*).

*«Recognizing the Iron Ox»* says:
Every **person** (*shi ren*) has an **Iron Ox** (*tie niu*)[^25] to ride,
Yet **limitless** (*wu xian*) **common folk** (*chang liu*) know it not.
When **hunger strikes** (*ji dao*), they **consume the golden Tiger’s marrow** (*jin hu zhi sui*),
When **thirst comes** (*ke lai*), they **drink from the silver water pool** (*yin yin chi*).
They **drag the chariot** (*qian che*) to rest beneath **two groves** (*shuang lin xia*),
They **harness the fire** (*yun huo*) at **midnight** (*ban ye shi*).
This is the **true operation of yin-yang** (*shi yin-yang zhen dong yong*),
**Generating life** (*sheng cheng jia huo*)—all **depends on it** (*jin sui yi*).

*«Union»* says:
**Chang’e** (*chang e*) descends nightly into the **Heavenly Palace** (*tian tang*),
A **red torch** (*hong ju*)[^26] welcomes her into the **cave chamber** (*dong fang*).
She **suddenly departs** (*za bie*) the **nine heavens** (*jiu tian*) to **pay homage to the Holy Ancestor** (*chao sheng zu*),
Only to **arrive** (*cai lin*) in **central China** (*zhong guo*) before the **Immortal Husband** (*xian lang*).
She **feeds on Queen Mother’s jade fruits** (*yin wang mu qiong lin guo*),
She **drinks the nectar from the Western Palace’s** (*xi shuang gui dian jiang*).
This is the **true transformation of Heaven and Earth** (*zhen zao hua gān kūn*),
How could **radiance** (*zhao zhao*) not **emanate everywhere** (*he chu sheng guang*)?

*«Entering the Chamber»* says:
Tonight at **midnight** (*ye ban*) is the **auspicious hour** (*liang chen*),
Joyfully meeting **husband and wife** (*fu qi*) to **reunite old bonds** (*jie jiu yin*).
**Li’s** **female** (*li nv*) and **Kan’s** **male** (*kan nan*) come in **proper order** (*lai shun ling*),
**Geng’s** **husband** (*geng fu*) and **Jia’s** **wife** (*jia fu*) recognize their **natural affinities** (*ren xiang qin*).
The **proud Dragon** (*jun long*)[^27] **seizes the mountain peak** (*chen shan tou xi*),
The **fierce Tiger** (*ling hu*) **descends into the pure sea depths** (*jiang gui hai nei chun*).
After the **grandmother** (*lao nu*) and **Liu Lang** (*liu lang*) meet,
They **lead** (*yin*) him into the **cave** (*dong fu*) to **refine into the true** (*lian cheng zhen*).

*«The Refined Mercury»* says:
Two **forking paths** (*qi lu*) meet at the **mud pellet** (*ni wan*),
Ascending **green mountains** (*qing shan*) only to descend again.
Each time the **yellow crone** (*huang po*) is sent to **bear the earthen door** (*jian di hu*),
She **commands the Green Emperor** (*qing di*) to **close the Heavenly Gate** (*bi tian guan*).
The **benevolent Dragon** (*ren long*) **twists along the Three Pure Ones’ path** (*san qing lu*),
The **righteous Tiger** (*yi hu*) **circles the Nine Turns Bay** (*jiu zhuan wan*).
It is **all entrusted** (*quan jia*) to the **golden son** (*jin gong zi*) for **seizure and binding** (*qin fu*),
How could the **sun’s soul** (*ri hun*) **dare not return** (*na gan bu gui huan*)?

*«Refining the Lead»* says:
The **Iron Ox’s offspring** (*tie niu zi hou*) is fed **red flowers** (*hong hua*),
Its **violent roaring** (*meng lie pao xiao*)[^28] **no force** (*shi mo jia*) can **restrain**.
Turning back, it **spits white snow** (*pen bai xue*) from the **sea**,
Revolving its body on the **path**, it **bears golden sprouts** (*chan jin ya*).
The **nine heavens’ light** (*jiu tian guang*) **melts into the Dragon’s fiery march** (*long xing huo*),
The **three realms’ yin-dew** (*san jie yin lin*)[^29] **is the Phoenix’s sand-spitting** (*feng tu sha*).
Understanding the **law of the heavens above the heavens** (*tian shang tian fa*),
One **naturally finds it easy** (*zi ran rong yi*) to **enter the Immortals’ ranks** (*dao xian jia*).

*«Parent and Child Reunion»* says:
**Steady thought** (*ding si*) and **congealed spirit** (*ning shen*) at **midnight** (*ban ye*) grow **strong** (*qiang*),
**Colored clouds** (*cai xia*) **swirl** (*liao rao*) above the **elixir chamber** (*dan fang*).
In the past, they **jointly governed** (*gong guan*) the **Geng-Xin lands** (*geng xin di*),
Today, they **dwell together** (*tong ju*) in the **Jia-Yi villages** (*jia yi xiang*).
Within the **five-colored waves** (*wu cai lang*), the **Dragon** (*long*) **emerges and vanishes** (*chu mo*),
Beyond the **nine heavens’ clouds** (*jiu xiao yun*), the **crane** (*he*) **soars** (*fei xiang*).
The **three talents** (*san cai*)[^30] **share the same law** (*tong fa*)—no **difference** (*wu cha bie*),
Yet **foolish mortals** (*zhi shi yu ren*) **recklessly speculate** (*luan cun liang*).

*«Strong Yang»* says:
When **yin is extinguished** (*yin xi*), **yang ascends** (*yang teng*) in **coiling cycles** (*fu guo zhou*),

For **three years** (*san nian*), it **dwells as a guest** (*zu ke*) within the **pitcher** (*hu zhong*),
The **two essences** (*er wei*)[^32] **reside together** (*tong ju*) on the **island of the sea** (*hai shang zhou*).
It **subdues the mystic pearl** (*xuan zhu*) to **return to Earth** (*gui wu tu*),
It **arranges the Li-fire** (*li huo*) to **awaken the Tortoise** (*qi kun niu*).
The **ninefold gates** (*jiu chong men*) **wrap it** (*guo*), yet it **can be recalled** (*kān hui shou*),
Straight up to the **Tortoise Peak** (*gui feng*)—**former haunts** (*shou you*).

*«Adding to the Cauldron»* says:
The **medicine** (*yao*) is **not gold, stone, nor the three yellows** (*fei jin shi ji san huang*),
It **purely uses the soul’s essence** (*ling yuan*) to **counter the five constants** (*dui wu chang*).
At **midnight** (*zi ye*), **add to the furnace** (*tian lu*) the **three surnames’ treasures** (*san xing bao*),
At **dawn and dusk** (*chen hun*), **pour into the cauldron** (*tou ding*) the **five families’ nectar** (*wu jia jiang*).
Beside the **jade terrace’s pool** (*yu lou chi pan*) and the **wind-cloud cave** (*feng yun dong*),
On the **Tortoise Ridge’s peak** (*gui ling shan tou*), the **parent-child chamber** (*zi mu fang*).
This is the **true secret of the Returning Elixir** (*huan dan zhen mi li*),
Where else could one

The **Three-Grade Altar** complete, its substances manifest—
On **Five-Peak Mountain**, the **Pí-Lú** hall is raised.
Yet knowing only to **use the North as South**,
This is the **model of yin-yang transformation**.

*«Sprouting and Germinating»* says:
When the **Tài hexagram’s** yang harmony fully sprouts,
The **elixir + cinnabar** stands ashamed—life is born.
**Huángpó** best understands blending **Wén** and **Wǔ**,
While **Chìdì** excels in governing **Jiǎ-Gēng**.
Encountering **sliced gold** in wind-blown blossoms and fruit,
Opening **enlightenment** with waves, rain, and clouds—
Then take the **Nine Wilds’ Silver River water**,
To irrigate the **immortal root**, making it thrive.

*«Dividing the Two Qi»* says:
By the **third month**, the embryo forms—**two qi** complete;
Diligently refining **water and fire**, the essence becomes singular.
A **cool wind** penetrates flesh, skin transforms,
**White qi** pierces the intestines—**marrow hardens**.
Within the **cauldron**, new **parents** are seen,
In the **flask**, old **lands and rivers** re-recognized;
When **yin-yang’s work** is fulfilled, the **true body** returns—
One **pure self** ascends among the **immortals**.

*«Changing the Cauldron»* says:
Each year turns anew—**each turn** fresh,
Layer upon layer enters the **cauldron**, banishing **demonic dust**.
Illuminating the **five viscera**, dispelling the **three meditations**,
Purifying the **upper chambers**, refreshing **ten thousand spirits**;
**Changing bones** relies on **golden phoenix marrow**,
**Replacing sinews** depends on **wood-dragon essence**;
Under **Nán-Gōng’s** name, the **immortal register** is inscribed,
Ranked on the **Dan Platform** as **Upper True One**.

*«Completion of the Work»* says:
After **nine turns**, the work is done—**the shell discarded**,
Ascension’s transformation soars to **highest decree**.
Five **streaks of mist** shine through **thousand realms**,
One **mysterious pearl** steadies the **nine regions**.
Beneath, **Yáo-Gōng’s** palace connects **ten caves**,
Above, **Jīn-qiè’s** gate crowns **three platforms**.
Circulating freely, the work’s depth is **unfathomable**—
Straight to **Azure Sky**, no turning back.

*«Direct Practice»* says:
**Direct practice** forbids **qi’s** and **hou’s** transgression,
**Precision in words**—**vigorous strength** in the **Microcosmic Orbit**.
Though able to **harmonize** the **Li-Gōng maiden**,
One must **borrow** **dike-defenses** from **Kǎn’s gate** and **lead**.
But **trim the red dust** from **Hòu-Tǔ**,
Naturally, **white liquid** becomes **pure Qián**.
Ancient and modern **Dao** is thus transmitted—
All **piercing** **Xī-Yí’s** **transformative authority**.

**The Fourth Scroll of *Dao Shū*** concludes.

**Yellow Emperor’s Questions**
*Returning from Kǎn-Gāng’s* **heights**,
*Revisiting the* **august Sage**.

The **Three-One** is thoroughly understood—
The **True** and the **Piercing** are known.

The **True Emperor** hid upon **Éméi Mountain**.
After the Yellow Emperor had pacified **Chīyóu**,
He sought the **Way of Non-Action**, wandering the world
until he reached the wilds of **Qīngchéng**,
where he first beheld the **Nurturing True Person**,
thus attaining the **Nine-One Principle**.

He then heard that the **True Emperor** was enlightened in the **Great Dao**,
so he followed to question him further.

The **True Emperor** said:
*"If you wish to cultivate your body,
first chill your intentions—then it may be done.
Thus, internally, calm your spirit;
externally, abandon your desires.
When afflictions arise, govern them with **qi**."*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"Do those who cultivate the Dao also suffer afflictions?"*

The **True Emperor** replied:
*"Those who hear the Dao late have already dissipated their **True Qi**,
their vitality wasted—how could they avoid afflictions?"*

The Yellow Emperor asked:
*"May I ask—with what **qi** does one govern them?"*

The **True Emperor** said:
*"For minor ailments, use **water**;
for great ones, use **fire**—
nothing can resist water and fire.
Deeply retreat, close your eyes,
and gaze at the **candle’s thread** above your nose—
do not let your mind stray from your original form or rise,
then you will be **established**.
Do not chase external phenomena.

Next, observe the **white light** emerging above your brows,
strenuously directing it into the **crown of the head**.
When **samādhi** is firmly attained, the work is victorious.

Let the **heart be without action**,
external thoughts not intruding.
From **Nine to Nine**, refine **Seven to Seven**.

If you wish to conceal yourself in the world,
constantly visualize the **crown opening**,
filling heaven and earth with **yellow clouds**.
With a **silent mind**, subtly contemplate—
within, there is a **spirit**.
With intent, act—
coming and going as you will.

To depart your body,
let **yellow clouds** envelop you—
sometimes returning to your form,
sometimes dividing your shape,
sometimes entering others’ bodies,
sometimes seizing others to benefit yourself,
or causing others to abandon their forms—
use **skillful means** to rescue, widely bestowing **virtue**—
this is permissible.
But to harm others for self-gain is guilt.

However, the method of **dividing the form**
requires awaiting the **birth of the Yang Number**.

In a **silent chamber**, refine the **Five Phases**:
At the crown, store the **Great Yang**—**forty-five** in number—
sufficient in quantity.

When the **five wheels beneath the brows** are complete,
arise within **establishment**.

Thus, within **fire**, the **Wood Spirit** emerges;
within **water**, the **Metal Qi** arises.
**Water and Fire**, the **Five Viscera**, circulate in exchange
without departing from **Earth**,
then contemplate the **True Essence** of the **Two Kidneys**,
uniting into **One Qi**.

The **heart’s blood** congeals downward, forming an **infant**—
its form is **yellow sprouts** upon **Earth**,
this is my **command**.

At the first light of dawn,
when the sun shines upon water a hundred times,
and again, it treads its shadow.

Thus, the **kidneys’ sun and moon** emit **red and white qi**,
and at night, **seven sevens** issue from the **crown**,
ten months later equal in **spiritual essence** to the body—
this is the **Earthly Immortal**.

Refine the **kidneys’ qi**, entering and exiting through the **ears**,
a hundred days to pour into the **Sea of Resonance**,
internally refining its **essence** into a **sword**.
Refine the **Five Viscera’s essence** to fill the **Nine-Nine** count,
letting the **Golden Cauldron** gather the **qi**,
soaring upward, ascending to heaven—
within **establishment**, again cast into the **womb**,
twice cultivated, twice bound—
twelve years to transform into **four bodies**,
its manifestations endless.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Excellent!"*
**Xuan’yuan’s Questions**

The heavens clear and the earth tranquil—**Dao** is drawn from within the self.
Use fire to guard the yin, and the yang becomes pure.

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"The **Daoist Master** speaks of those who move and those who remain still—what does this mean?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The moving is **mercury**—the **qi** of passion, rising and dispersing; the still is **lead**—the **qi** of turbidity, heavy and unaroused. There is no true difference between them. When **lead** ascends, it is because it has encountered fire; when **mercury** does not rise, it is because it has met **lead**. Movement brings birth and death, stillness finds no resting place."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"Where in the body is the **Yellow Court of the Purple Palace**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"This is the **Sea of Essence**, the **Abode of Clarity and Stillness**—within the liver, its **gallbladder** is the place."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is the **Mud Pill**? What is its form?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"This is the **Sea of Blood**, divided into nine chambers. Each chamber is square and round, a span in breadth, with a circumference of nine inches, and its color is white. Within it, one chamber holds blood, and it is called the **Blood Sea**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"The **elixir** has yin and yang—what is its color? Where does it reside?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The yin **elixir** dwells in the **Sea of Blood**, its essence the **silver lead** of the **blood-internal spirit-soul** (*hun-po*), residing in the **cinnabar field**. The yang **elixir**’s essence is **precise**, its master the **heart-spirit** (*xin-shen*) within the **cinnabar field**, the **dragon of mercury**. Here, the **qi** of yin and yang converge—this is the **source of the elixir**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"Why does **Nine Refining** reach nine?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"**Nine Refining** is **Nine Transformations**. In the first year, **qi** is nourished; in the second, blood is enriched; in the third, the **vessels** are strengthened; in the fourth, flesh is perfected; in the fifth, marrow is refined; in the sixth, sinews are tempered; in the seventh, bones are hardened; in the eighth, hair is vitalized; in the ninth, the body is fully formed."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is **Returning the Elixir**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"It is the **elixir** completed in nine years. Its eyes are like **lacquered pitch**, its skin like **congealed fat**, its bones like **jade**, and its intestines like **tempered sinews**."*

---

The **Way of Cultivation** is vast and boundless.
**Zhengyang** said: *"The **Lord of the Piercing Cavern** is **Lü Dongbin**.
Reading the **Scriptures of the Elixir** and **Mysterious Books**, their meaning is profound and abyssal.
Fearful that later generations might not fathom them, I asked **Zhengyang** of the **Chongli Cloud Room**:
‘The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* speaks of those who move and those who remain still—what does this mean?’*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The moving is **mercury**—the **qi** of passion, rising and dispersing; the still is **lead**—the **qi** of turbidity, heavy and unaroused. There is no true difference between them. When **lead** ascends, it is because it has encountered fire; when **mercury** does not rise, it is because it has met **lead**. Movement brings birth and death, stillness finds no resting place."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"The **Yellow Court of the Purple Palace** resides within the body—where exactly?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"This is the **Sea of Essence**, the **Abode of Clarity and Stillness**—within the liver, its **gallbladder** is the place."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is the **Mud Pill**? What is its form?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"This is the **Sea of Blood**, divided into nine chambers. Each chamber is square and round, a span in breadth, with a circumference of nine inches, and its color is white. Within it, one chamber holds blood, and it is called the **Blood Sea**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"The **elixir** has yin and yang—what is its color? Where does it reside?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The yin **elixir** dwells in the **Sea of Blood**, its essence the **silver lead** of the **blood-internal spirit-soul** (*hun-po*), residing in the **cinnabar field**. The yang **elixir**’s essence is **precise** (*jing*), its master the **heart-spirit** (*xin-shen*) within the **cinnabar field**, the **dragon of mercury**. Here, the **qi** of yin and yang converge—this is the **source of the elixir**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"Why does **Nine Refining** reach nine?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"**Nine Refining** is **Nine Transformations**. In the first year, **qi** is nourished; in the second, blood is enriched; in the third, the **vessels** are strengthened; in the fourth, flesh is perfected; in the fifth, marrow is refined; in the sixth, sinews are tempered; in the seventh, bones are hardened; in the eighth, hair is vitalized; in the ninth, the body is fully formed."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is **Returning the Elixir**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"It is the **elixir** completed in nine years. Its eyes are like **lacquered pitch**, its skin like **congealed fat**, its bones like **jade**, and its intestines like **tempered sinews**."*

The white hair sprouts from the brow,
Golden radiance encircles the body.
Moving faster than six swift steeds,
Piercing vision extends a hundred paces beyond,
With a constant fragrance of purity from mouth and nose.

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"Why are they called **lead** and **mercury**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"**Lead** arises from the left of the kidneys—its exterior is dark, its interior white, the true *qi* of wood. It dwells in the northern *zi* position, the yin within the yin. Yet it has two aspects: the refined essence of lead when touched by fire, and the brain’s vital blood essence.

**Mercury** arises from the right of the kidneys—its exterior is green, its interior red, the true *qi* of metal. It dwells in the southern *wu* position, the yin within the yang. Yet it has four aspects: the *liuli* (glazed stone), the water reaching the central palace, the congealed essence forming sand, and the bile’s fluid *qi*."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"How does **Transformation** achieve the elixir?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"One must draw water from the mountain’s peak, fire from the ocean’s depths, extract mercury from the towering heights, and gather lead from the Nine Heavens. When mercury enters, lead settles and returns, congealing in the central palace—its form like a parrot’s beak, its hue crimson and orange, its name the **Sacred Embryo**. Thus, the dark and white separate to form the **Transformative Pair**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"When refining the **Microcosmic Orbit**, sometimes fire is withdrawn, sometimes added—its use spans years, months, days, and times. Why?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"Years, months, days, and times belong to water, all rooted in yin, capable of overcoming fire. Thus, the months of **late spring** and **late autumn**, the seventh and eighth days, the twenty-second day, the third day, as well as the **waning moon** and **new moon**, are all unsuitable for practice.

If the **Three Peng** guard the **Spirit Storehouse**, the work is difficult to complete—one must rely on methods and discipline."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What in the body serves as fire?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The ignorant take the heart as fire. Within the heart lies a spirit—the **Celestial-Terrestrial Furnace**, the **Yin-Yang Cauldron**, located beneath the heart. If one takes the heart as fire, fire instead resides above—how then can one cook? This is not the **Achieved** path. Fire must rise from below, like a steaming pot. Thus, fire is the *qi* of the **Primordial One** below the navel, fully gathered into flame, while water emerges from the brain."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is the **Furnace**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"It exists within our body. In the great cold of the forge, an external furnace holds the fire, allowing molten metal to be placed within. Inside the crucible lies the medicine, sealed beneath a cover. Our furnace is no different!"*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"May I inquire about the **Forge’s Gate** and its form?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The **Purple Smoke** is not the fire of the world. **Purple Smoke** is *qi*. When the **Three Pure Ones** ascend and descend within and without, and the breath flows continuously through the nose, then the refining yields **Purple Smoke**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What are the **Four Serpents** and **Two Mice**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The four are the **Four Seasons**; the two are the **Sun and Moon**. Marvelous—these are difficult to speak of!"*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"Where does the **Chamber of Mystery** reside?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"It lies between the brows, entering two *cun* before the **Dirt Pellet**, shaped like a jade mountain, within which dwells the **White Primordial Spirit** at the **Purple Extremity**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What of the **Hall of Clarity**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"It lies before the **Chamber of Mystery**, entering the brow by one *cun*, within which resides the **Central Primordial Spirit**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is the **Supreme Method** of *‘Store Three, Guard One’*?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"One substance with three forms—water, fire, and earth. When gathered, they become the heart, the kidneys, and the spleen; when transformed, they become *qi*, blood, and essence. *Qi*, blood, and essence refine into spirit. While in the body, they are the **Red, Yellow, and Dark Cauldrons**—this is the **Central Palace**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"How does human life and death cycle endlessly?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"This is no mystery—it lies in **nature**. Those who abandon themselves to greed, letting greed breed attachment, attachment breed torment, torment afflict the heart, a disturbed heart scatters the spirit, a scattered spirit fuels desire, and desire brings sickness and death."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is **nature**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"It exists in the **Great Void**—this is difficult to speak of. The coming and going of form and *qi* is **nature**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"What is **spirit**?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"It is the **True *Qi* of the Supreme One** in the **Upper Mysterious Palace**. Its count is thirty-six thousand, shifting with its manifestations. Thus, *qi* transforms into spirit, spirit transforms into *qi*—when *qi* is present, spirit endures; when spirit departs, *qi* scatters. Its scattering becomes **clouds and mist**. It is named **form**; its emergence is **immortality**; its return is **truth**. It binds above to the **Three Primordial Ones**, below to all things, and follows the **Nourishing Path**. Thus, the undispersed is **truth**; the dispersed is **death**."*

**Xuan’yuan** asked: *"When spirit and *qi* are exhausted, how does *qi* perish?"*
**Zhengyang** replied: *"The body has six orifices. When blood is depleted and sparse, the spirit becomes unclear and unsteady. Unclarity causes the **body fluids** to stagnate; unsteadiness invites **evil *qi** to gather. Thus, the **passage of life is blocked**, and the **path of death opens**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **Jīnyè** and **Qióngjiāng**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"**Qióngjiāng** is the **tears of the eyes**; its residual *qi* flows to the right of the **upper lip**, becoming **Jīnyè**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is **Shénshuǐ**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **blood within the heart**; its residual *qi* flows to the left of the **tongue**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Then what is the **Huá Chí**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **water within the kidneys**; its residual *qi* flows to the right of the **tongue**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is **Huángyá**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It arises from within the **brain**, dwelling in the **central palace**; it is the **phlegm of the brain**, the **fluid of the spleen**. Its residual *qi* flows to the **upper lip**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Qīnglóng**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **liver**, the **Wood**. Within it, **Shénshuǐ** ebbs and flows, residing to the left of the **spinal column’s victory point**, and internally emerges from the **eyes**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Bái Hǔ**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **lung**, the **Metal**. Within it, **Shénshuǐ** ebbs and flows, residing to the right of the **spinal column’s victory point**, and internally emerges from the **nose**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Zhūquè**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **heart**, the **Fire**. Its position is the **south**, its **stem-branches** are **Bǐng-Dīng**; within it, **Shénshuǐ** flows from the right of the **abdomen** to beneath the **tongue**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Xuánwǔ**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **kidneys**, the **Water**. Its position is the **north**, its **stem-branches** are **Rén-Guǐ**; within it, **Shénqì** flows from the left of the **abdomen** to the **ears**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Gōuchén**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **spleen**, the **Earth**. Its **stem-branches** are **Wù-Jǐ**; within it, **Shénqì** flows from the **kidneys’ center**, ascending along the **spine** to the **victory point**, and enters the **brain**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Huángpó**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **spleen’s Earth**; hence it is called **Huáng**. It is the *qi* of the **spleen**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Jīnwēng**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **lung’s Metal**; hence it is called **Jīn**. It is the *qi* of the **lungs**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are **Zǐnǚ** and **Yīng’ér**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"**Zǐnǚ** is the **phlegm of the heart**; **Yīng’ér** is the **water of the kidneys**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"When *qi* issues forth in **xū**, **hē**, **xī**, **hū**, **xī**, **yàn**, **chuī**, and **jiào**, to which **viscera** does it belong?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The *qi* of the **nose** belongs to the **lungs**, hence it is called **xī**; the *qi* of the **mouth** belongs to the **liver**, hence it is called **chuī**. As for **yàn**, it belongs to the **lungs**; **chuī** belongs to the **kidneys**; **hū** belongs to the **spleen**; **hē** belongs to the **heart**; **xī** belongs to the **Triple Burner**; **jiào** and **xū** belong to the **bladder**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **inner** and **outer Eight Trigrams**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **inner** are:
- **Liver**, **Zhèn**;
- **Heart**, **Lí**;
- **Lung**, **Duì**;
- **Kidneys**, **Kǎn**;
- **Great Abdomen**, **Qián**;
- **Gallbladder**, **Xùn**;
- **Small Abdomen**, **Kūn**;
- **Bladder**, **Gèn**.

The **outer** are:
- **Eyes**, **Lí**;
- **Tongue**, **Zhèn**;
- **Mouth**, **Duì**;
- **Ears**, **Kǎn**;
- **Neck**, **Qián**;
- **Toes**, **Kūn**;
- **Abdomen**, **Xùn**;
- **Hands**, **Gèn**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Tiān Cāng**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It has three names: **Shítáng**, **Yànmén**, and **Dìhù**—it is the **mouth**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Tiěniú**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **Qīnglóng**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Chónglóu**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **Yùlóu**—the **human’s food cavity**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Within **huǎnghū**, there is **wù**; within **yǎomíng**, there is **jīng**. What does this mean?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **wù** is the **water within the *qi***. This water is formless—when **Winter Solstice** arrives, **Yin** reaches the **Heaven**, and accumulated *qi* generates it. It is the **Tàijí** giving birth to **Yin**; it has three names: **True Water**, **Lead**, and **Tiger’s Soul**. Its form is white, its nature is **Metal**; hence it is called the **Golden Crow of the Sun**, the **Jade of Stone**, the **Metal of Water**, the **blood of the brain**—collectively called the **Sea of Blood**, dwelling within the **brain**.

The **jīng** is the **qi within the water**. This *qi* is formless—when **Summer Solstice** arrives, **Yin** reaches the **Earth**, and accumulated **Yin** generates it. It is the **Tàijí** giving birth to **Yang**; it has three names: **True Fire**, **Mercury**, and **Dragon’s Spirit**. Its form is red, its nature is **Fire**; hence it is called the **Jade Hare of the Moon**, the **Sand of Water**—in humans, it becomes **tendons**, **bones**, the **rigid essence of things**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **Wū** and **Yù**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Jīnwū** is the **water within the heart**, the **true *qi* within the water**; the **Yùyù** is the **qi within the kidneys**, the **true water within the *qi***."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"How do the **Five Sacred Peaks**, **Six Ministries**, **Four Great Rivers**, **Five Lakes**, **Nine Rivers**, **Two Palaces**, and **Wind and Rain** differ?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **left cheek** is **Tàishān**; the **chin** is **Héngshān**; the **right cheek** is **Huàshān**; the **jaw** is **Chángshān**; the **nose** is **Sōngshān*. The **Five Viscera** are the **Five Lakes**; the **Six Fu-organs** are the **Six Ministries**. The **Triple Burner** are the **Three Palaces**. The **nine bends of the large intestine** are the **Nine Rivers**. **Jīng** is the **river**; **sōu** is the **Yellow River**; **xuè** is the **Huai River**; **jīn** is the **Jì River**."*

The **Four Seas** are also spoken of. **Sweat** is **Rain**; **Qi** is **Wind**.

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"One body is like one state. Who are the sovereign and ministers?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Heart** is the **King**; **Qi** is the **Chancellor**; the **Spleen** is the **Great Officer**; the **Lungs** are the **Grand Scribe**; the **Kidneys** are the **Chaste Lady**; the **Liver** is the **Ministry of Revenue**. The **Gallbladder** is the **Ministry of Rites**; the **Stomach** is the **Ministry of War**; the **Bladder** is the **Ministry of Punishments**; the **Sea of Essence** is the **Ministry of Works**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Dragon**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **Original Qi**, born from the left and right of the **Two Kidneys**, within the **Yao-Ming Palace***. The **Sea of Original Essence**—great or small, like a ring—its **Qi** entering and exiting like a crimson thread. It is the **Father of Spirit**, the **Root of Yang**, and the **Source of Yin and Yang**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Tiger**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is the **Yin-blood**, the **Yin-fluid**, transformed into it. Born from **Li***, it steals the **True Qi of the Five Grains**, reaching the **Heart** and then flowing into the **Kidneys’ domain**, where **Essence-Qi** is formed. This is called **Cinnabar Mercury***. The **Fire Dragon** is in **Kan***, the **Root of Life**, the **Mother of Spirit**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"**Lead** is **stillness**, **nature**; where does **nature** originate?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **True Qi of the Five Grains**, stolen by the **Heart**, transforms into **blood**; then **blood** condenses into **fluid**, and **fluid** refines into **True Qi**, which solidifies into **Spirit**—this is **nature**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"**Mercury** is **movement**, **life**; what is its meaning?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"**Life** resides within the **Two Kidneys**, inside the **Sea of Original Essence**, issuing forth the **True Original Qi**. Thus, within it lies **True Water**, born originally from the **Heart**, flowing into the **Kidneys** and transforming into **Essence**. **Essence** is no closer than these two*—**Heart** and **Kidneys**—so the **Spirit’s Original Flow** ceases not, else **Spirit** would be unsettled."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"When the **Root** is established, the **Dao** arises—what is the **Root**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"**Spirit**, **Qi**, **Essence**, **Bone Marrow**, **Tears**, **Saliva**, **Ting-Liquid**, **Blood**, **Sweat**, and **Mia-Liquid***—these are the **Root**. If the **Root** is not established, it is like a tree’s trunk rotted by woodworms, its branches withered and dry. Thus, when **Qi** flows through my body, it nourishes my form—this is called **Spirit-Water**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **Three Pools**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **mouth** is the **Pool of Jade**; the **Nì-Wán** is the **Pool of Heaven**; the **stomach** is the **Middle Pool**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Nine Palaces**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"Within the **brain** are nine chambers; its bones are eight pieces, and within the nine chambers lie four **female** and five **male** guardians."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **Three Passes**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **mouth** is the **Heavenly Pass**; the **hands** are the **Human Pass**; the **feet** are the **Earthly Pass**. The **Nì-Wán** is the **Upper Pass**; the **Gàng Palace** is the **Middle Pass**; the **Lower Original** is the **Lower Pass**. Why call these **Passes**? To close and seal them—this is not the speech of those who do not grasp the **Dao**. I now tell you: The **Upper Pass** is the **eyes**; the **Middle Pass** is the **nose**; the **Lower Pass** is the **mouth**. Their paths connect to the **Nine Orifices**, where **evil** takes harm. Thus, one must lock them tight."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Humans possess **Heaven**, **Earth**, **Yin**, and **Yang**—what does this mean?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **head** is **Heaven**; the **feet** are **Earth**—this is the **external**. The **Heart** is round and the **Kidneys** are square—this is the **internal**. The **Sun** is **Yang**; the **Moon** is **Yin**—this is the **external**. **Qi** ascends and **fluids** descend—this is the **internal**. Thus, **Heaven** reaches **Earth** in **eighty-four thousand li***; the **Heart** reaches the **Kidneys** in **eight cun and four fen***. This is the **Heart-Kidneys’ analogy to Heaven-Earth**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"The **Two Solstices** and **Two Equinoxes**—how do they apply to me?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **hour of Zi** and **hour of Wu** are the **Two Solstices**; the **hour of Mào** and **hour of Yǒu** are the **Two Equinoxes**. This is the **Sun’s analogy to the Two Solstices and Two Equinoxes***. The **New Moon** and **Full Moon** are the **Two Solstices**; the **Two Equinoxes** are the **Two Equinoxes**. This is the **Moon’s analogy to the Two Solstices and Two Equinoxes***. When the **Sun** reaches its **northern solstice**, **Yang** ascends, rising from below to return to **Heaven**, and thus **one Yin** reaches. When the **Sun** reaches its **southern solstice**, **Yin** descends, falling from above to return to **Earth**, and thus **one Yang** reaches. The **spring equinox** is the division when **Yang** ascends above, encountering the **spring equinox** and entering **Yang**, departing **Yin**. The **autumn equinox** is the division when **Yin** ascends above, encountering the **autumn equinox** and entering **Yin**, departing **Yang**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Where do the **Five Bandits** dwell?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"Humans nourish themselves with the **Five Grains** and are born from the **Five Phases***, yet birth brings decay. Thus, the **Five Phases** can both give life and cause death—how they become **bandits**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are **monthly cycles**, **seasonal nodes**, **daily hours**, and **yearly divisions**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **twelve hours** make up **one day**; **five days** are **one cycle**; **three cycles** are **one seasonal Qi**; **two seasonal Qi** are **one node**; **two nodes** are **one season**; **four seasons** make up **one year**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Is there a method to **Lock the Yang Pass**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"Enter the chamber, draw your body inward, and sit upright. Guard **Spirit** and **Awareness** within, gently pressing your sides."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is **elixir** and its **refinement**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"Fill your mouth with **Ting-Liquid** and swallow it, returning it to the **Palace of Life**. Circulate **Qi** within the **Yellow Court***, and thus **Qi** and **fluids** transform and form **Essence**. **Ting-Liquid** accumulates into **blood**; **blood** accumulates into **pearls**; **pearls** become **mercury**; **mercury** becomes **sand**; **sand** becomes **elixir**—this is its **refinement**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Yellow Court**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It lies above the **Bladder**, before the **Spleen**, **Stomach**, and **Kidneys**, behind the **navel**, to the right of the **Liver**, and to the left of the **Lungs**. It is like the **parrot’s nest** or the **balance stone**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Why is the **Spleen** called **Yellow Mother** but not **Yellow Court**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Spleen** can receive **Heart-Liquid** and **Kidney-Qi**, blending them to form **elixir**, but it is not the **Yellow Court**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Where does one **advance the Fire**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"Fire arises below the **navel**—invisible when observed, yet cannot be grasped from afar nor abandoned when near. It appears like the **deep blue void**, beyond naming."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is **Golden Liquid refining the Form**, and how does **Form and Spirit** unite with **Dao-Truth**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"Refining **mercury** yields **Spirit**; refining **Qi** yields **Form**. Thus, **ascending behind** and **swallowing before**, each substance merges to form the **embryo**—this is **uniting with Dao-Truth**, the **Golden Liquid refining the Form**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is **daily practice with the Eight Trigrams**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"At the hour of **hai** (11 PM–1 AM), apply **Qian** (Heaven); at **zi** (1–3 AM), apply **Kan** (Water); at **yin** (3–5 AM), apply **Gen** (Mountain); at **si** (5–7 AM), apply **Xun** (Wind); at **you** (5–7 PM), apply **Dui** (Lake); at **shen** (7–9 PM), apply **Kun** (Earth); at **wu** (11 AM–1 PM), apply **Li** (Fire); at **mao** (7–9 AM), apply **Zhen** (Thunder). These are the **external** applications. The **Spinal Passes** also have three **Gates**—may I inquire about them?"*

**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Spinal Passes** have twenty-four nodes, with each **Gate** spanning three nodes. Below the **brain**, it is called the **Jade Gate**; opposite the **spine**, it is called the **Middle Gate**; and opposite the **Kidneys**, it is called the **Lower Gate**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"I have heard the name of the **Great Dao**, but not its nature."*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Dao** is formless; speaking of it is not the **Dao**. The **Dao** is void; describing it with the real is not the **Dao**. The **Dao** takes the void as its substance—like a shout echoing in the mountains, where the **valley** responds. Thus, **nurturing within the Lungs** is **Spirit-Qi** and **True Nature**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"When **cultivating True Nature**, there are **demons** that disturb—how does one deal with them?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"If thoughts do not return to unity and wander outward, **demons** will arise. When the **mind** moves, **Spirit** is confused; when **Spirit** is confused, one falls into **torpor**; when in **torpor**, **demons** flourish and the work is hard to complete."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Is there a way to **ward them off**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"It is difficult to speak of!"*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"How do **wind**, **clouds**, **rain**, **mist**, **frost**, **snow**, and **canopy** vary so?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"This is the **True Primordial-Qi**. Its **Qi** is unstable: when exhaled, it becomes **canopy**; when inhaled, it becomes **mist**; when blown, it becomes **wind**; when breathed upon, it becomes **clouds**; when scattered, it becomes **frost and snow**; when condensed, it becomes **rain and dew**. When it ascends, it darkens the sky; when it descends, it sinks to the earth. The **clear** rises and floats, the **turbulent** falls and settles—thus it follows its transformations."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"The human body has the **numbers of Heaven and Earth**—both **upper** and **lower** positions are complete. **Gold** weighs eight **liang** (128 **qian**), totaling **192 qian**; **Silver** is the same. **Yang** and **Yin** also follow this measure. Thus, the **Sixty-Four Hexagrams** have **384 lines**. One **qian** is divided into four **fen** to correspond to **Yin-Yang Fire**. These numbers align with the **cycles of the sun and moon**—what does this signify in humans?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"I have already spoken of the **numbers of Heaven and Earth**. Eight thousand four hundred **li** (league) span **Heaven and Earth**; eight **cun** (inches) with four **fen** (divisions) correspond to **Heart** and **Kidneys**. Thus, he who **grasps the numbers of Heaven and Earth** can manipulate them as easily as counting on his palms—two and five make ten."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **state of the White Horse’s Fangs**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Five Phases** are complete. The **true Qi** of the five **Zang** (solid organs) and their **liquids** and **Essences** condense. Their **Qi** and **fluids** merge in the **Crucible**, and thus **White Qi** emerges—its appearance like **flaring flames**, like the **fangs of a white horse**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Does the **Heart** have alternate names?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Heart** is the **South Point** (compass). Its **stem** is **bing-ding** (丙丁), its **virtue/power** is in **Fire**, its **hexagram** is **Li** (離), and its name is **Crimson Mercury**, the **Foot of the Red Dragon**, the **Jade Maiden**, the **Li Maiden**, the **Jade Terrace**. The **Heart** has **blood**, called the **Marrow of the Red Phoenix**—when it flows into the **brain**, it is called the **Sea**; when it flows into the **Golden Pool**, it is called **Divine Water**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Does the **Kidney** have alternate names?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Kidney** is the **North Point**. Its **stem** is **ren-gui** (壬癸), its **virtue/power** is in **Water**, its **hexagram** is **Kan** (坎), and its name is **Infant**, **Mysterious Lead**, **Golden Light**, **Golden Essence**, **Spiritual Root**, **Jade Jar**, **Jade Furnace**, the **Turtle of the Northern Sea**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is **Nine Returns and Seven Refinements**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"From **zi** (1–3 AM) to **shen** (7–9 PM) is **Nine Turns**. Thus, the **refiner** completes one **turn** in nine years, three **turns** making one **cycle**. **Heaven** has **Seven Luminaries**; humans have **Seven Orifices**. The **Seven Luminaries** move five **stages** at night; the **Seven Orifices** correspond to the **Five Zang** (solid organs) in **internal** practice. My **True-Qi** circulates **up and down**, from **shen** to **yin**—alternating **Yin and Yang**, ascending and descending, floating and sinking—**Essence**, **Marrow**, **nasal mucus**, **saliva**, **Qi**, **fluids**, and **sweat**. Preserving them day and night without loss is **Seven Refinements**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **Golden Crucible** and **Golden Flower**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Golden Crucible** is the **canopy** below the **Flowery Cap** (华盖), positioned in the **West**. Its **stem** is **geng-xin** (庚辛), and its **virtue/power** is **Metal**."*

The **Golden Flower** is the **lung**, its position in the **West**, its **qi** white. From the **lung** it emerges, congealing like a **flower**.

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What of **Divine Light**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"After nine years of cultivation, its light will manifest."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Is **Mind** like a **horse** or like a **monkey**? I do not know the forms of the **Dry Horse** or the **Station Horse**."*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **Dry Horse** is the **heart’s fluid**; the **Station Horse** is its **qi**. The **monkey** is the **heart’s intention**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What is the **Dry Ox**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **qi** of the **kidneys**, the **Water** of the **North**—the **Metal Ox**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **Six Bandits**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **eyes**, the **ears**, the **nose**, the **tongue**, the **heart**, and the **mind**. All things originate from these—what root is there that does not stem from them?"*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"What are the **Three Vehicles**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **forehead and temples** are the **Great Ox-Cart**, the **Sheep-Deer-Cart**; the **stomach cavity** is the **River-Cart**, the **Celestial River**, the **Water Palace**—**True-One qi** from the heavens enters through the mouth and nose, hence it is called the **River-Cart**; the **region below the navel** is the **Fire-Cart**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Which is the **Cave of Penglai**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **upper and lower regions of the abdomen**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Which is **Caoxi**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **inner lips, outer teeth**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Which are the **Three Corpses**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"The **qi of the heart and kidneys**—one is the **Three Poisons**, the other is the **Three Corpses**. When the **Three Corpses** are annihilated, **True-Form** is achieved."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"Where do the **Two Springs** originate?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied: *"They emerge from within the **mouth**, beneath the **tongue**, with two orifices on either side, each as large as a **sealed needle’s tip**. They connect to the **heart and lungs**, and at times, **essence-fluid** is generated in the **throat**—this moistens all things and nourishes the **Five Zang**."*

**Pure Yang Child** asked: *"How does one resemble **Heaven and Earth**?"*
**Zhengyang Child** replied:
*"My **eyes** are the **sun and moon**; my **intestines and stomach** are the **lakes and seas**; my **joy and anger** are the **clouds and clear skies**; my **nose and forehead** are the **Five Peaks**; my **breathing** is the **thunder and lightning**; my **Five Zang** are the **Five Phases**; my **qi** is the **winds and clouds**; my **hair and fur** are the **grasses and trees**; my **sweat and pores** are the **dew and rain**; my **blood vessels** are the **rivers and streams**; my **nasal mucus and saliva** are the **frost and snow**; my **filth** is the **dung and soil**; my **male and female** are **Yin and Yang**; my **form** is the **house and beams**; my **nine orifices** are the **Nine Luminaries**; my **four limbs** are the **four directions**; my **hair follicles** are the **four symbols**; my **Five Phases** are the **five planets**; my **saliva and fluids** are the **springs**; my **four symbols** are the **four seasons**; my **eight trigrams** are the **eight nodes of Earth**; my **awakening and sleep** are **day and night**; my **lice and fleas** are the **ants and crickets**; my **aging and infancy** are the **cold and heat**; my **calamity and prosperity** are the **waxing and waning of the sun and moon**; my **life and death** are the **reversal of Heaven and Earth**.*

*"He who can fathom the **mechanisms of Heaven and Earth** may equal their duration."*

**Pure Yang Child**, having heard the **essential Dao**, then opened the **Mystic Lock** and understood the **Eight Leaks**:
*"The **eyes’ excessive discharge** is the **Liver Leak**; the **nose’s runny mucus** is the **Lung Leak**; the **mouth’s excessive saliva** is the **Kidney Leak**; the **external body’s sweat** is the **Heart Leak**; **nighttime sweating** is the **Small Intestine Leak**; **sleeping with drool** is the **Brain Leak**; **dreaming with ghosts and lust** is the **Spirit Leak**; **lustful desire** is the **Body Leak**.*

*"If these eight are sealed and not leaked, and their essence is gathered into the **Golden Crucible and Jade Pool**, refined into **lead and mercury**, then it may be measured."*

**Pure White Child** inquired at the **Ladies of Mount Li**,
and the **Essential Dao** of the *Yin Fu* was first expounded,
its teachings revealed with grandeur—**the erudite of mountains and marshes** were astounded.

**Pure Yang Child**, surname Yanggu, courtesy name **Pure White**,
and known as **Pure Yang Child**—met a **strange and wondrous adept** in the **capital of Shu**,
whose pupils were deep and luminous as a **moon’s crescent**, radiant with light.

**Pure Yang Child** was struck by this and sought him out for instruction.
The adept replied: *"Aye."*

**Pure Yang Child** then asked: *"Does not the* **Yin Fu** *speak of the Dao above—where the gods and immortals embrace the One,
the laws in the middle—where wealth and peace for the land and people are cultivated,
and the methods below—where armies are strengthened and battles won? What does this mean?"*

The adept said: *"To embrace the One is to refine the **Spirit**.
The* **Laozi** *says: 'The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two;
the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to all things.'
The One is **water**.
Heaven generates the **divine water** as the foundation of wondrous transformation—
the* **I Ching** *'s 'Heaven One' is this.
The **True One Child** says: 'This is the essence of **True Lead**,
the root of Heaven and Earth, the progenitor of **Yin and Yang**.
All things depend upon it for their creation,
and myriad spirits rely upon it for their **expansion and contraction**.*

'He who can embrace the One and hold to the Middle
will not let the **Spirit-qi** disperse—
this is the **True Person** indeed.

In ancient times, the **Yellow Emperor** obtained the **True One Scripture** of the **Celestial Sovereign**
yet did not grasp its meaning,
so he visited the **Royal Person** at **Mount Emei**
and asked him about it.

The **Royal Person** said: 'The **True One** resides within the **Great Abyss of the Northern Pole**,
before which stands the **Bright Hall**,
beneath which lies the **Crimson Palace**.
There, the **Flowering Canopy** and **Golden Tower** rise;
to the left, the **Ladle Constellation**; to the right, the **Kui Constellation**,
with **Dragon and Tiger** standing guard on either side.
It neither takes nor gives—
the One rests in its place;
neither slow nor swift—
the One enters its chamber.'"

「能暇能豫，一乃不去；
能 rest in leisure and ease, the One then does not depart.

守一居真，乃得通神；
Hold fast to the One and abide in its truth, then one attains the **transcendence of the Spirit-qi**.

节饮约食，一乃留皂.
Moderate drinking and restrict eating, the One then lingers in the **Cinnabar Field**.

故知一者非难也，守之而勿失者为难也。
Thus it is known that attaining the One is not difficult, but preserving it without loss is the true challenge.

纯粹子曰：世之学者以道为强名者也，号之虚无以为自然，无为更不修炼，斯何如耶？
**Chunzhuzi** said: "The scholars of this age merely use **Dao/Way** as a grand name—
they call it **emptiness and nothingness** as though it were **natural**,
and claim that **non-action (wuwei)** requires no further cultivation and refinement.
What kind of **Dao/Way** is this?"

奇士曰：斯言过矣，不知天地要用之机，阴阳变化之道。
**Qishi** replied: "Your words are excessive—
you do not understand the **essential mechanisms of Heaven and Earth**,
nor the **Dao/Way of yin-yang transformation**!

夫无为者，非不修炼者也。
**Non-action (wuwei)** is not the same as neglecting cultivation and refinement.

不因修炼其何以离於生死乎？
Without cultivation and refinement, how could one transcend **birth and death**?

所谓无为者，无所不为也。
So-called **non-action (wuwei)** means **acting without bounds**—
it is not inaction!

身外之物谓之有为可也，悟道修真非有为也。
External things may be called **action (youwei)**,
but **enlightenment to the Dao/Way** and **cultivation of the True Person** are beyond such labels.

夫道者，性之本也；
The **Dao/Way** is the **root of nature (xing)**—

性者，心之源也。
nature (xing) is the **source of the mind**.

心性同体，应化无边，
Mind and nature share the same essence, responding to transformations without limit—

是乃所谓自然者也知乎此而能虚心实腹，
this is what is called **natural**—
to grasp this and **empty the mind while filling the abdomen**,
to **embrace the One and transform**—

则可以仙矣。
then one may attain **transcendence (xian)**."

纯粹子曰：富国安民者奈何？
**Chunzhuzi** asked: "How does one **enrich the land and bring peace to the people**?"

奇士曰：炼气之法也。
**Qishi** replied: "It is the **method of refining the qi**."

《老子内丹经》曰：一身之设，一国之象也。
The **Laozi Inner Alchemy Scripture** states: "The structure of one’s body mirrors that of a **land**."

圣人以身为国，以心为君，以精气为民。
The **sage** regards the body as the **land**,
the mind as the **sovereign**,
and the **essence-qi** as the **people**.

民安则国斯泰矣，民散则国斯虚矣。
If the **people** are at ease, the **land** prospers;
if the **people** are scattered, the **land** becomes desolate.

夫能惜精爱气，则所以长生者也。
He who **cherishes the essence and nurtures the qi** is the one who **prolongs life**.

夫人之形禀父母精血而为，元气所化者也。
The human form is shaped by the **essence and blood** of one’s parents,
and it is the **primordial qi** that transforms it.

中黄真人曰：骨肉者以精血为根焉，灵识者以元气为本焉。
**Zhonghuang Zhenren** said: "The **bones and flesh** take **essence and blood** as their root,
while **spirit-consciousness (lingshi)** relies on the **primordial qi** as its foundation.

性者，命之本也；
Nature (xing) is the **root of fate (ming)**—

神者，气之子也；
Spirit-qi is the **child of the qi**—

气者，神之母也；
The qi is the **mother of the Spirit-qi**—

子母者，不可斯须而离也。
child and mother cannot be separated for even a moment.

如是则气乃湛然住於丹田而成变化矣。
Thus, the qi **settles and abides in the Cinnabar Field**,
where transformations take place.

《老子》曰：绵绵若存，用之不勤。
The **Laozi** says: "Continuous as though it endures,
its application is effortless.

出息微微，入息绵绵，
**Breathing out** is subtle and refined,
**breathing in** is continuous and prolonged—

深根固蒂，此长生久视之道也。」
**deep-rooted and firmly established**,
this is the **Dao/Way of longevity and enduring vision**."

《内观经》曰：气来入身谓之生，神去於形谓之死，
The **Scripture of Inner Observation** states: "When **qi enters the body**, it is called **life**;
when **Spirit-qi departs from the form**, it is called **death**—

所以通生谓之道。
thus the **Dao/Way of transcending life** is spoken of.

於是气旺则人旺矣，气衰则人衰矣，
When the **qi thrives**, the person thrives;
when the **qi declines**, the person declines—

故日气能富形，
thus it is said that **qi can enrich the form**—

神能御气而飞形者也。
**Spirit-qi can command the qi and transcend the form**.

其诀在乎天门开，地户闭，
Its **secret lies in opening the Celestial Gate**,
and **closing the Earthly Gate**—

永永绵绵而勿废。
enduring and continuous without cessation.

其吸也至於根，
**Inhalation reaches down to the roots**—

其呼也彻於蒂，
**exhalation penetrates to the base**—

如鹦抱卵，如鱼生水，
like a **parrot brooding over its egg**,
or a **fish giving birth in water**—

圣胎成而斯蜕矣。」
when the **sacred embryo** is complete, then **transcendence (tui)** occurs.

纯粹子曰：强兵战胜奈何？
**Chunzhuzi** asked: "How does one **strengthen the army and achieve victory in battle**?"

奇士曰：金液炼形者也。
**Qishi** replied: "It is the **refinement of the form through the Golden Elixir**."

积魂以消阴魄，阳兵以御阴寇，
**Accumulate the soul** to **dissolve the yin spirit**,
and **deploy the yang army** to **ward off yin invaders**—

盖用五行相克，八卦相荡，
this is done by **applying the Five Phases to overcome each other**,
and **using the Eight Trigrams to harmonize and dispel**—

归根复命而成丹者也。
**returning to the root and restoring fate** to **forge the elixir**.

黄帝曰：还丹百数，其要在乎神水华池。
The **Yellow Emperor** said: "There are countless **methods of returning the elixir**,
but their essence lies in the **Divine Water of the Flowering Pool**.

易真子曰：还丹者，反覆阴阳之气者也。
**Yizhenzi** said: "The **returning of the elixir** is the **repetitive inversion of yin-yang qi**."

圣人设其法象诱太阳之气，
The **sage** establishes its **methods and symbols** to **attract the Solar Qi**—

先为神丹以驻形神，
first **forging the Divine Elixir** to **stabilize the form and Spirit-qi**—

然后能成其道焉。
only then can one **fulfill the Dao/Way**.

如国之有寇须兵以制之，
Just as a **land** must **deploy its army** to **conquer invaders**—

既制之矣乃可行皇王之道焉。
once conquered, it may then **pursue the path of the sovereign**.

坎戊者，月精也；
**Kanwu** is the **essence of the moon**—

离己者，日光也；
**Lijǐ** is the **light of the sun**—

坎离者，水火也；
**Kanli** are **water and fire**—

子午者，卯酉也；
**Ziwu** are **Mao and You**—

龙虎者，乌兔也；
**Dragon and Tiger** are **Wu and Tu**—

震兑者，房参也；
**Zhendui** are **Fang and Shen**—

魂魄者，阴阳也；

金华秋石者，婴儿姥女也；
**Golden Flower and Autumn Stone** are **baby and old woman**—

黄芽白雪者，丹砂也；
**Yellow Sprout and White Snow** are **cinnabar**—

交梨火枣者，玉醴金浆也；
**Jiaoli and Huozao** are **jade nectar and golden broth**—

河车者，黄婆也；
**Hechhe** is the **Yellow Mother**—

神水者，华池也。
**Divine Water** is the **Flowering Pool**.

此殊名而同归者也，
These are but **different names for the same essence**—

其要不出乎阴阳而已。
their core does not stray beyond **yin and yang**.

《太一志》曰：圣人括《易》象以炼铅焉，
The **Record of the Supreme One** states: "The **sage** employs the **symbols of the Yi** to **refine lead**—

固身保神非外物也。」
**solidifying the body and preserving the Spirit-qi** is not an external thing."

曹真人曰：以元气补元气，岂必丹砂石哉！
**Caozhenren** said: "To **supplement the primordial qi with primordial qi**,
why must one rely on **cinnabar and stones**?"

陶真人曰：缀花不可以结实，内肉不可以成胎。
**Taozhenren** said: "One cannot **attach flowers** to **produce fruit**,
nor can one **insert flesh** to **form an embryo**."

立乾坤，运水火，合三才，应天符，
**Establish the trigrams of Qian and Kun**,
**circulate water and fire**,
**unify the Three Realms**,
**respond to the Heavenly Mandate**—

然后可以为丹矣。
only then can one **forge the elixir**.

刘真人曰：乾坤者，鼎也，天地之道也；
**Liuzhenren** said: "Qian and Kun are the **cauldron**,
the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth**—

坎离者，药也，南北之位也；
Kan and Li are the **medicine**,
the **positions of the south and north**—

龙虎者，束西也。
Dragon and Tiger are the **restraint of the west**."

真一子曰：自复也、乾也、娠也、坤也，
**Zhenyizi** said: "Self-renewal, Qian, pregnancy, Kun—

十有二辰之中观其气候，
within the **twelve celestial stems**,
observe the **climates of the qi**—

分震巽之门，
**divide the gates of Zhen and Xun**—

子而往，午而来，
**enter at Zi** and **exit at Wu**—

阴符阳火合於天符。
**yin corresponds with yang fire**,
uniting in the **Heavenly Mandate**.

三百有六十度，
**Three hundred and sixty degrees**—

此晦朔阴阳刑德交会、天地变化万物生成之数也。」
this is the **number of the waxing and waning of yin and yang**,
of **the Five Phases’ mutual overcoming**,
of **the convergence of Heavenly transformations**,
where **Heaven and Earth’s changes give rise to all things**.

依乎刻漏而运行焉，
**Follow the water clock** in its operation—

夺取气候入於神室之中，
**seize the climates of the qi**,
**entering the Divine Chamber**—

可使真铅天地之母受此运用而产精神者也。
one may **cause the True Lead, the mother of Heaven and Earth**,
to **receive this operation** and **bear the Spirit-qi**.

《龙虎经》曰：道犹驭也，
The **Dragon-Tiger Scripture** states: "The **Dao/Way** is like **driving a chariot**—

衔辔准绳，随軏辙之处中以制乎外者也。
**holding the reins and measuring the lines**,
**following the proper path** to **control the external**—

盖有偃月之鼎，
there exists the **cauldron of the crescent moon**—

其要在乎三日庚生以开兑之户，
its **secret lies in the three days of Geng**,
where the **gate of Dui is opened**—

黑金胚出而白银来矣。」
when the **black metal embryo** emerges,
**white silver** then appears."

The **Nine-Six** are spring and summer,
their **application lasts five-three**—

the **Seven-Eight** are autumn and winter,
their **return and movement** come thereafter.

Thus it is known: the **Great Elixir** is the **Primordial Qi’s** transformation.

Therefore it is said:
**"Divine Pool’s** water of refinement,
**jade mercury and gold lead**,
**Heaven and Earth’s** cyclic operations,
**Sun and Moon’s** alchemical brewing—
**Lunar and Penetrating** kindle the fire,
**advance and retreat** refine the essence,
**drawing and adding** in **baptismal** practice,
**nine transformations** in one year,
**Kan and Li** penetrate and harmonize,
**three thousand labors** performed,
**held without ceasing**,
**transmutes form into Daoist Immortality**.

**Pure and Refined Child** then understood the **essentials of the Three Pure Ones**,
and further asked: *"Can one cease movement and refine the Spirit?"*

The **Wondrous Sage** replied:
*"Then one becomes a Daoist Immortality*,
for **its form sinks** while **its Spirit ascends**."

**Pure and Refined Child** asked: *"Can one cease movement and refine the Qi?"*

The **Wondrous Sage** replied:
*"Then one becomes a **Fetal Immortality***,
for **its Spirit-qi** intermingle in **sensitive resonance**,
**congealing the embryo** and **nurturing the infant**,
like the **shedding of a cicada**."

**Pure and Refined Child** asked: *"Can one cease movement and refine the Form?"*

The **Wondrous Sage** replied:
*"Then one remains in the world*,
for **it returns youth** to **minority**."

**Pure and Refined Child** asked: *"If all three methods are practiced together, what then?"*

The **Wondrous Sage** replied:
*"Then one ascends to **Celestial Office**."*

**Pure and Refined Child** asked: *"Beyond these three methods, is there still another Dao?"*

The **Wondrous Sage** replied:
*"There are indeed:
**preserving the Spirit** and **entering samadhi**,
**corpse dissolution** and **living departure**,
**taking rebirth** and **transmigrating form**,
**treading the Dou’s steps** in **offering**,
**Five Symbols** and **Three Qi**,
**Five Teeth** and **Six Characters**,
**embracing the Moon** and **harvesting the Sun**,
**ingesting Qi** and **cutting off grains**,
**exhaling and inhaling**, **bending and stretching**,
**guiding and preserving thought**—
these **thousands of techniques** are all **shallow lateral methods**,
**gradual stages** for the **beginner**,
not worthy of advancement."*

**Pure and Refined Child** then followed and received the **precepts** for refining **Spirit, Qi, and Form**.

The **True Edict Chapter** lists the **sublime essences of the Immortals**,
uttering words as **scriptures**;
**condensing its profound mechanisms**,
one may **follow life’s order**.

Du Guangping, whose **art-name is Du Qieyu**,
a **man of the Later Han Dynasty**,
transmitted the **Dao of Mysterious White** to **Master Jie**—
he sat and reclined **daily**,
at will **preserving thought** in the **muddy pellet**,
where **black qi** emerged;
then **preserving thought** in the **heart**,
where **white qi** emerged,
and in the **navel**,
where **yellow qi** emerged.

When he first **preserved thought**,
the **qi** issued forth like a **bean**,
then **its great surge ascended to Heaven**.
Thus the **three qi** like clouds,
**ensnared the throat** and **wrapped the body**,
covering his **form above**,
**transforming into fire**—
within the **three throat-passages**,
they **reunited with their reflections** to **refine one body**,
and within **one body**,
the **five viscera** shone **penetratingly**.

Thus he **practiced this daily**,
until **midday**, when he ceased.

Then he **ingested Qi** **two hundred and twenty times**,
the **so-called method** of *"knowing white and guarding black"* **to avoid death**.

The **Great Substance Elixir Scripture** states:
*"On one side of the face*,
**constantly rubbing** with the **left and right hands** **to generate heat**,
**high and low** following the **body’s contours**,
**all made to reach their utmost**—
one may **prevent wrinkles and spots** from arising,
and **radiate luster** like a **maiden**,
the **so-called method** of *‘mountains and rivers harmonizing Qi’*."

The **Scripture of Essence-Refining Massage** states:
*"When rising or lying down, one must **align Qi** and sit **upright**,
first **crossing the left and right hands**,
then **covering the neck behind**,
**lifting the head** to gaze upward,
while **raising the neck**,
**making the neck and hands contend** **three or four times**,
**to harmonize the Essence** and **blood**,
**to prevent wind-qi** from entering.
Afterward, **bending and moving the body**,
**stretching the hands to the four extremes**,
**reaching outward, pulling sideways**,
**propagating and shaking the hundred joints**,
**doing each three times**—
then **rising** and **donning fine or thick silk**,
**wiping the neck and behind the ears**,
**making all areas warm** **in a gentle manner**.

**Following the hair’s growth**, **massage the neck** as if **combing the scalp** **without count**—
after a long while, **massage the left and right hands** to **treat the face and eyes**.
Then **swallow saliva twenty times**,
**to guide the internal fluids**.
**Practicing this constantly**,
one’s **eyes become bright**,
one’s **body remains unsoiled**,
and **evil qi** does not **dry up**.

At the **time of life-giving Qi**,
**swallow saliva seven times**,
**press the body’s pains** toward their **corresponding directions**,
and **invoke**:
*"Left Mysterious, Right Mysterious*,
**three Spirits** **unite truly**;
*Left Yellow, Right Yellow*,
**six Refined** **correspond harmoniously**;
*Evil wind-qi and pestilence*,
**suppressed and hidden** **in the four quarters**."

「The **Jade Elixir** flows and nourishes, **promoting free circulation** above and below;
**within**, it dispels **water and fire**,
**without**, it repels **inauspicious influences**;
**eternal life and ascension** are attained,
**as the body remains ever robust**.

After **invoking**, **swallow saliva** again **seven times**,
**pressing** the **pains** of the body **twenty-one times** in total.
**Practicing this constantly**,
one shall **be free from illness**.

The **ears and eyes** are the **steps to seek the True**,
the **gates to all spiritual essence**.
**Constantly** use **the hands** to **press the small acupoints** behind the brows **thirty-nine times**,
**massage the upper eyelids** with the **palms and fingers**,
and **rotate the ears with the hands** **thirty times**—
**the rubbing must be swift and without fixed measure**.

Once completed,
**use the hands to reverse-comb the forehead** **thirty-nine times**,
from the **center of the brows** and **return upward** into the **hairline**.
**Swallow saliva without limit**,
**and practicing this constantly**,
one’s **eyes grow clear and bright**.

Behind the **brows** lies a **small acupoint**,
**the abode of the Upper Primordial’s Six Harmonies**,
**where the radiance of life’s essence is born and transformed**.
Below the **eyes**, at the **upper eyelid’s edge**,
**is the ford of Regulus**,
**and rotating the ears with the hands** follows the **path of the Bright Pearl**.

**Human aging** does not **begin with the ears and eyes**,
but if one **uses the hands to reverse-comb the forehead** while **internally preserving the essence of the Red Boy**,
then **both sun and moon shine eternally**,
and the **Upper Primordial rejoices**.

Thus, **completing the thirty-nine cycles**,
**this is the "Hands Serving the Three Primordials"**,
**which firmly secures the brain and hair**.

The **four sides of the head**,
**use the left and right hands to comb them**,
**following the hair’s growth to its knots**,
**only increasing the strokes**.
Then **the scalp’s blood circulates freely**,
and **wind-dampness** does not **congeal**.

Once done,
**press the eyes with the hands twenty-nine times**,
**this is the method to inspect the eye’s spirits**.

The **Master of Fate** said:
*"If one **keeps a pure fast** and **avoids grains**,
then **the sun abides in the day** and **the moon in the night**,
**residing in the mouth**,
**making them large as rings**—
the **sun** is **red** with **purple radiance** and **nine rays**,
the **moon** is **yellow** with **white radiance** and **ten rays**.
**Then swallow the luminous essence**,
**and practice this secretly without limit**,
or **let the sun and moon dwell in the face**,
**with the sun on the left and the moon on the right**,
**so that the two lights merge with the pupils**,
**their qi interflowing**—
**this is the method to gather and nourish life’s essence**,
**to harmonize and unite the soul and spirit**."

The **True Person of the Great Void** said:
**"On the moon’s fifth day**, during the **Child’s hour**,
**internally preserve the sun’s form** and **let it enter through the mouth**,
**dwelling in the heart’s center**,
**illuminating the inner mind**,
**and merge its light with the sun**,
**feeling the heart grow warm**.
**Then swallow saliva nine times**.
**On the fifteenth day**, the **twenty-fifth day**, and the **twenty-ninth day**,
**repeat this practice**,
**and the ears and eyes become keen and penetrating**,
**the hundred channels clear and bright**,
**the face radiates with jade-like luster**,
**the body glows with golden sheen**.
**After fifteen years**, the **Celestial Ascension’s Divine Vehicle** will arrive.

The *Scripture of Great Wisdom* says:
**"Within the heart**, there is a **sun** as large as a **coin**,
**red** with **nine rays**,
**rising from the heart**, passing the throat to the teeth,
**returning to the stomach**.
**After a long while**, one **sees it within the heart and stomach**.
**Then exhale and swallow saliva thirty-nine times**,
**three times daily**.
**Practicing this for a year** removes illness,
**for five years** the body **radiates with splendor**,
**at eighteen years** one **may attain the Dao**,
**and the sun moves without shadow**.

**At night**, **wear the moon’s essence** like **wearing the sun’s**,
**only descending from the brain**,
**entering at the throat’s root**,
**not emerging from the teeth** but **returning to the stomach**.

**Zhang Weizi** said:
**"At dawn**, first **close the eyes and gaze inward**,
**as if seeing the five viscera**.
**Then exhale through the mouth twenty-four times**,
**so that the eyes perceive the five-colored qi** **entwined upon the face**,
**and inhale through the mouth fifty times** to **absorb these five-colored qi**.
**Swallow saliva sixty times**,
**knock the teeth seven times**,
**swallow saliva seven times**,
**and then open the eyes**.
**Practicing this for long**,
one **rides the clouds and mist** while traveling—
**this is the method to wear the mist**."

The **True Consort of the Nine Flowers** said:
**"The sun is the substance of the mist**,
and **the mist is the sun’s essence**.
I have **heard of the method to wear the sun**,
but **never seen the scripture of eating the mist**.
The **scripture of eating the mist** is **most secret**,
but the **method to gather the mist** is **most simple**.

The **eyes** are the **mirror of the body**;
the **ears** are the **window of the form**.
**Excessive vision** causes the mirror to **dim**,
**excessive listening** causes the window to **close**—
I have **the technique to polish the mirror and clear the window**.

The **face** is the **courtyard of the spirit**;
the **hair** is the **flower of the brain**.
**Grief in the heart** causes the face to **wither**,
**the brain’s decay** causes the hair to **turn white**,
**the loss of vital essence** diminishes the **crimson elixir**—
I have **the method to restore youthful complexion and return to black hair**.

**Essence is the spirit of the body**;
**luminosity is the treasure of the form**.
**Excessive toil** causes **essence to scatter**,
**overuse of the mirror** causes **luminosity to fade**—
I have **the scripture to augment essence and prolong luminosity**."

**If one steadfastly guards the True Essence**,
**in one year**, the **head will not turn white**,
**and baldness will regrow**.

**If one harbors internal familial burdens and external worldly ties**,
**with broad hearing and mingled breath and voice**,
then **the Dao is not single-minded**,
**and practice yields no benefit**.

**True talent often hides in forests and mountains**,
**far from the world**,
**and if one embraces it with sincerity**,
**then youthful visage and dark hair endure**.

**Thus I shall prescribe the elixirs of Jade Nectar and Golden Grain**,
**the fruits of Fire Peach and Intertwined Pear**—
**if the body is not yet pure and refined**,
**and malicious thoughts fill the heart**,
**then these cannot be attained**.

**Fire Peach and Intertwined Pear** are **not external things**;
**they are born from the heart**.
**If the heart harbors thorns and brambles**, then **peach and peach do not appear**.

The **Great Lord of the Azure Boy** said:
*"To cultivate the root of **extinction and enlightenment**,
one must **uproot the seed of birth and death**;
**to sink into the Nine Abysses**,
one must **only sit and preserve the corporeal form**."*

The **True Person of the Western City** said:
*"The spirit is the **vessel for transcending the form**,
**a thin shore** must be **crossed**;
**to linger on the Wheel of Birth and Death**,
one must **only suffer** from **indecisive heart**."*

**Can one who seeks the Dao** **fail to exert their own power**?

**When a person dies**,
**if their form resembles life**—
**their feet do not turn blue**,
**their skin does not wrinkle**,
**their eye’s light is not extinguished**,
**their hair does not fall out**,
**and their bones remain firm**—
**this is **spontaneous dissolution**."*

The **spontaneously dissolved immortal** merely attains to ride the **Celestial Canopy**, mount the **Flying Dragon**, ascend the **Supreme Pole**, and wander the **Nine Palaces**.

Those who have attained the Dao and temporarily dwell in the **Great Yin**—the **Great Unity** guards their corpse, the **Three Souls** tend to their bones, the **Seven Spirits** defend their flesh, and the **Fetal Spirit** preserves their **qi**.

For those who cultivate the Dao, they must ensure the **Three Passes** are always harmonized.
The **mouth** is the **Pass of the Heart**;
the **feet** are the **Pass of the Earth**;
the **hands** are the **Pass of Humanity**.
When the **Three Passes** are harmonized, the **Five Viscera** will be at peace.

**Jiang Bozhen** encountered an immortal. The immortal leaned against him at **high noon**, and his shadow was askew.
The immortal said: *"You are earnest in your pursuit of immortality, yet your heart is not upright—why so?"*
I will instruct you.
When the sun rises three *zhang* high, place your hands above your shoulders, aligning the sun with your heart. When your heart grows warm, your heart will be upright.
Heeding this, he attained the Dao.

At **midnight**, remove the pillow and lie flat outside, gripping firmly and relaxing the body. If the **qi** flows smoothly and subtly, then both **body and spirit** are complete.

There are **nine afflictions** in the pursuit of the Dao:
Having **resolve but no timing**—the first;
Having **timing but no companion**—the second;
Having a **companion but no resolve**—the third;
Having **resolve but no teacher**—the fourth;
Meeting a **teacher but remaining unaware**—the fifth;
Becoming **aware yet not diligent**—the sixth;
Being **diligent yet failing to uphold the Dao**—the seventh;
Having **resolve yet not steadfast**—the eighth;
Being **steadfast yet not enduring**—the ninth.

**Joy and anger** diminish one’s resolve;
**Pleasure** harms one’s nature;
**Wealth and honor** confuse one’s **virtue**;
**Yin and Yang** exhaust one’s essence—
These are the **taboos of the Dao**.

Those who cultivate the Dao must constantly **expel the dead qi** and **draw in the living qi**, carefully restraining laughter and speech while contemplating their form.

Why does the **ritual method** sharpen one’s vision?
I take **clear water** from the **first day of the Heavenly Stem-Branch cycle**, mix it with **True Elixir**, and wash the eyes—thus, clarity is attained.

**The Most High** said: *"How many days does human life span?"*
Some said, *"Within a few days."*
Others said, *"Within a meal’s time."*
**The Most High** said: *"Not yet."*
Some said, *"Within a breath."*
**The Most High** said: *"Excellent! This is to know the Dao."*

Zǐwēi Fūrén said: *"Those who cultivate the Dao are like holding fire in a darkened chamber—when the darkness vanishes, only the light remains.*

**Wealth and desire** are like the blade’s sweetness—
A child knows its taste but not the peril of severed tongue.

Nánjí Lǎorén said: *"Love begets sorrow; sorrow breeds fear.
Thus, without love, there is no sorrow—
Without sorrow, there is no fear."*

Tàishàng Zhēnrén said: *"How does one play when the strings are slack?"*
Some replied: *"Neither mournful nor joyous."*
*"How when the strings are taut?"*
*"The sound breaks, and grief is wounded."*
*"When slack and taut are balanced?"*
*"All harmonies blend, and the eight tones resound in perfection."*

Tàishàng Zhēnrén said: *"To study the Dao, fix the mind—like tuning a zither.
Those who cultivate the Dao think of morning meals without fail;
Guard their qi as their face—none shall remain unpreserved.
The vulgar chase fame like incense burning for their own tomb—
When buried, their qi is extinguished, yet they crave only to be heard.
Is this not delusion?"*

The *Tàisù Jīng* says: *"Rub your face with both hands until warm—
Then wrinkles and blemishes vanish, leaving radiance."*

Rub your palms until hot, then wipe your eyes,
And with your hands, comb your hair as if with a brush.
Massage your arms with both hands—
Then your hair will not gray, and your pulses will not float."*

The *Xiāomó Jīng* says: *"If the body is restless,
Retract your tongue to block the throat,
Gargle with saliva, swallow without counting—
Then the body will find peace.
Press your ears repeatedly—
Hearing sharpens, as if fortifying the city walls,
Recorded in the Imperial Register of Names.
Press your nose’s sides repeatedly—
Qi becomes balanced, as if irrigating Zhongyue,
Recorded in the Imperial Decrees.
When drowsy, sit with closed eyes,
Gazing inward to see the five viscera—
Then the intestines and stomach will be clear.
As I comb my hair, I face the Sovereign’s land and pray:
*'Níhuán Xuánhuá, preserve essence eternally—
Left, the hidden moon; right, the root of the sun.
Six directions refine in purity—
A hundred spirits receive this grace.'*
After swallowing saliva three times,
Your hair will not gray, and vitality will renew daily."*

The *Zhēngyī Jīng* says: *"Retaining the breath in stillness makes demons tremble—
The Functionaries and Dragon-Tiger Lords arrive.
Why are dreams malevolent?
First, the spirit is bewitched;
Second, the heart is tested;
Third, the corpse-thief strikes.
Upon waking, pinch the *rénzhōng* fourteen times,
And strike your teeth fourteen times—
Then misfortune turns to fortune.
For auspicious dreams, rub your eyes fourteen times,
And tap your teeth fourteen times.
Sleep on a raised bed—
Then earthly qi cannot reach you, and malevolent ghosts cannot assail.
Ghostly qi invades those who dwell too low.
At night, striking your teeth makes ghosts recoil, daring not to approach.
On *jiǎyín gēngshēn* days, ghosts contend, and the spirit grows restless."*

Huángniú Dàoshi said: *"At night, keep the sun at your brow,
The moon at your navel—
Then all malevolence retreats."*

Zhōngshān Liú Wěi studied Daoist cultivation for twelve years.
A仙师 tested him by suspending a ten-thousand-*jin* stone with a single hair,
Commanding him to sleep beneath it.
Liú Wěi remained calm and plump—
The仙师 could instruct him daily.
After taking the Divine Elixir,
He ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Once, a man devoted to the Dao knew not its method,
And night and day bowed to a cypress, seeking longevity.
After twenty-eight years, the tree bore purple blossoms,
Sweet as candy—
And he ate them, becoming immortal.
Some bowed to Tàihuá,
And the Old Man of the Western Peak taught them the Dao.
Some bowed to the River for ten years,
And the River Spirit granted them the method of water-walking without drowning.
This was no other—
It was the power of utmost sincerity.

Wáng Zhòngfǔ absorbed the two luminaries,
Ate mist for forty years, yet achieved nothing.
His son practiced for eighteen years and ascended.

Nányuè Zhēnrén told Zhòngfǔ: *"Your brain’s palace is deficient,
And your sinews lack nourishment—
How could you succeed?"*
After treating his illness, Zhòngfǔ refined his essence and also ascended.

Thus, those who study the Dao must first nurture their bodies—
Then may they discuss the Way.

*(End of Dao Shū Volume Six)*
*(Beginning of Dao Shū Volume Seven)*

The *Dao Shū* Volume Seven continues:

When **Youzi Zēng Cāo** compiled the *Huángtíng Pān*, he gathered the teachings of **Inner Vision**, which indeed has two schools. Examining their most refined essence, their intent is without deceit.

The **Glazed Palace** within a person—this is the **Upper Clarity**—its name is **Purple Mist**. It is where the five phases gather harmoniously within the body, the most refined of *qi*.

The **Three Souls** are:
1. **Tāiguāng** (Fetal Light), dwelling in the **Upper Dan Field**;
2. **Shuǎnglíng** (Luminous Spirit), dwelling in the **Middle Dan Field**;
3. **Yōujīng** (Mysterious Essence), dwelling in the **Lower Dan Field**.

The **Lower Dan Field** is the **Lower Close-to-the-Genitals**—also called the **Gate of Life**, the **Golden Gate**, the **Mysterious Gate**, and the **Gate of Death and Birth**. The **Two Kidneys**—the left is **Minor Yang**, the right is **Major Yin**—connect upward to all the vessels and reach the **Ending of the Channels**, this being the **Secret Door**.

What the two kidneys produce is like the *qi* of the sun and moon, constantly entering and exiting with each breath, internally irrigating the **Gate of Life**, ascending to the **Mud Pillow**, and flowing upward and downward like the sun and moon’s movement. One must always keep this in mind during movement and stillness, inhalation and exhalation.

The **Original *Qi*** emerges from the **Lower Dan Field** and circulates through the body. When the day’s *yang* reaches its peak, *yin* arises, so the two converge at the **Mud Pillow**. *Yin* and *yang* push each other in an endless cycle, just as the stars are arranged in the day and night. If one can **cultivate *qi* and preserve essence**, attuning to its rhythms, then the refined *qi* will condense and transform like **purple smoke and white clouds**, filling the **Three Dan Fields**. When it ascends, it becomes **cloud**; when it descends, it becomes **rain**, nourishing the five *zàng*-organs and rooting them.

**Absorb the essence** above, **do not let *qi* escape** below—when *qi* and essence are full, like a deep well gushing with spring water, it naturally flows endlessly, passing through the nostrils and entering the mouth, nourishing the body. Thus, **yellow lead and purple mercury** are born.

Harvest and refine them according to the seasons, entering them into the **Dan Field**, penetrating all the joints—then they will naturally emerge from the **Dark Chamber** and illuminate the **Gate of True *Yang***. This is what is meant by *"Returning Purple, Embracing Yellow, Entering the Dan Field."*

The **mouth** is the **Jade Pool**. Its refined essences all come from the **spleen and stomach**, which transform water and grain into essence. Its source is the **Elbow Post**, surging to the **Winnowing Fish Gate**, branching into four vessels: the two lower ones enter from the back of the crown, piercing the two orifices of the tongue and emerging through the gaps in the lower teeth; the two upper ones enter the **Mud Pillow**, passing through the two orifices of the upper palate and emerging through the upper teeth.

If the *qi* is unbalanced, water and grain cannot be transformed, the **spleen and stomach’s *qi*** weakens, and the **Jade Pool** dries up.

The *Classic* says: *"To not sleep day or night is to achieve the True."*

*"Not sleeping"* does not mean not lying down—it means dispelling the **obscuring *yin* *qi***.

The *Nine Sovereigns’ Alchemical Classic* says: *"By day, swallow the refined essence; by night, contain the true *qi*. Over time, the *qi* will naturally circulate through the Three Palaces like the sound of waves."*

Thus, the mind aligns with *qi*, *qi* aligns with spirit—blended and harmonized, clear and still, unattached to external things, entering the realm of **immobility**.

Why practice **Nurturing the Yellow Court**? To **close the Eight Gates**, **lock the Golden Gate**, **clarify the Spirit Platform**, **sweep away the Dark Chamber**, and make the two *qi* converge at the **Toad Palace**—this is how one refines **Jade Elixir** and **repairs the blood-brain**.

The **ears**, the **nose**, the **mouth**, the **heart**, and the **Gate of Life**—these five orifices must not be recklessly opened. One must **withdraw the senses and return the hearing**, cutting off all external perceptions. This is called **"The Seven-Jewel Lock Closing the Two Gates."**

To practice **Great Circulation**, one must first **master the Three Essentials**—the **ears**, the **eyes**, and the **mouth**—and then **close the Golden Gate**. Thus, the **Primordial One’s Mysterious Spring** dissolves at the **Deep Pass**, ascending to **Kunlun**.

The **Nine-Minor Immortals**, who always carry the **Tiger Talisman**, are **gold from the depths**.

The **spleen** is the **Horizontal Ferry**. The spleen is one *chǐ* long, the ferry three *cùn* and six *fèn*—located beneath the heart, called the **Yellow Court’s Treasury**.

The **heart** and **spleen** are like father and son. This is **fire arising from earth**, the dwelling of the **Spirit Platform**.

The **nose** is the **Central Peak**. The left nostril’s *qi* is **financial *yang***; the right nostril’s *qi* is **obscuring *yin***. Day and night, *yin* and *yang* shift—first converging at the **Dan Field**, then flowing to the **Cubit**, passing through the nose, penetrating the five *zàng*-organs, and returning to the **Gate of Life**.

**Biānqué** said: *"With one exhalation, the pulse travels three *cùn*; with one inhalation, the pulse travels three *cùn*. When breath is steady, the pulse travels six *cùn in total*. Day and night, there are **13,500 breaths**, so the pulse travels **50 degrees** and completes its circuit through the body. Its movement is endless, like a ring with no beginning."*

**Nourishment** is *yang*; **Defense** is *yin*. If **Nourishment** is delayed by one breath, **cold** arises; if **Defense** is excessive by one breath, **heat** arises. If the spirit controls *qi*, the nose will not lose its rhythm, like an infant in the womb.

Thus, **Womb-Breathing** reaches from the **Gate of *Qi*** to the **Sea of *Qi***, without the labor of mouth and nose.

Why do **True Persons** breathe with the heels? When *qi* settles at the **Lower Primordial**, the breath becomes long and distant; when it rises above the **Three Burners**, the breath becomes short and hurried.

**Gě Zhēnrén** said: *"The wise tortoise and crane live a thousand years without eating—because they master breathing."*

Beneath the tongue are three orifices: the left is **Golden Spring**, the right is **Jade Dew**, and the center is **Mysterious Embrace**—all gushing sweet waters to irrigate the **Sea of *Qi***. The **Sea of *Qi*** is the **Gate of Life**, this being the **shore of life and death.**

「The **Three Treasures**—**Spirit** (*shén*), **Qi**, and **Essence** (*jīng*)—are the body’s most precious gifts.

Their cultivation has three essential stages:
- **First**, guide and lead the hundred limbs (*bǎi huái*), smooth the flow of blood and vessels, and harmonize the four limbs to ensure their tranquility;
- **Middle**, diligently refine the hundred virtues (*bǎi xíng*), embrace and restrain the soul and spirit (*hún pò*), and preserve the myriad gods (*wàn shén*) to safeguard all life;
- **Final**, purify and temper the **Primordial Essence** (*běn yuán*), soar like the sun and moon, and restore the **True Essence** (*zhēn jīng*). For when one attains the **True Essence**, immortality (*xiān*) is possible.

The key to nurturing the body lies in **mindful cultivation** (*cún xiǎng*), which includes **false contemplation** (*wàng xiǎng*) and **true contemplation** (*zhēn xiǎng*).
- To **close the eyes and gaze** (*bì mù zuò guān*), one may either draw the **Five Colors of Qi** (*wǔ sè zhī qì*), transmute the **luster of sun and moon**, assume the forms of **Dragon and Tiger**, or manifest the likeness of an **infant**—or even ponder the **crimson pearl** or visualize the **golden elixir** (*jīn dān*). These are all **false contemplations**.
- To **close the eyes and inwardly observe** (*bì mù nèi shì*), one must make the **Spirit recognize Qi** and the **Qi recognize Spirit** (*shén rì qì, qì rì shén*). Thus, the **Qi becomes the Spirit’s womb** (*shén tāi*), the **form becomes the Qi’s master** (*qì zhǔ*), and when **Spirit and Qi merge naturally**, this is **true contemplation**.

When the **sun and moon’s energies** are fully realized, one may enter and exit their **orbits** (*gǔ*).

The **lungs** govern **Qi**, and are called the **Flowery Canopy** (*huā gài*). Below, they connect to the **Gate of Life** (*mìng guān*), and above, they pierce the **Divine Abode** (*shén lú*). If **Qi does not flow**, the nose becomes congested (*bì sé yǔng zhì*).

Then, one must **nurture the White Primordial** (*bái yuán*), adjust the **Six Qi** (*liù qì*) with stillness—**smiling inhalation** (*shěn*), **exhaling breath** (*xū*), **prolonged exhalation** (*hē*), **blowing**, **calling forth**, and **drawing in** (*hū, xī*). This can **transform stagnation** (*gé yōng zhì*).

What is the **White Primordial**? It is the **True Qi** of the lungs. Among all methods to **nurture the body**, none surpass **circulating Qi**.

When **Qi is active**, blood thrives; when **blood thrives**, essence solidifies; when **essence solidifies**, spirit becomes luminous; and thus the **Four Seas** within the body flourish.

What are the **Four Seas**? They are **Qi**, **blood**, **essence**, and **marrow** (*suǐ*). Their essence lies in **avoiding the Five Injuries** (*wǔ shāng*):
- Excess **salty** harms the heart (*xīn*);
- Excess **bitter** harms the lungs (*fèi*);
- Excess **sour** harms the spleen (*pí*);
- Excess **spicy** harms the liver (*gān*);
- Excess **sweet** harms the kidneys (*shèn*).

Moreover, prolonged **gazing** injures the blood (*xué*), prolonged **anger** consumes the Qi (*qì*), prolonged **standing** weakens the bones (*gǔ*), prolonged **sitting** harms the flesh (*ròu*), and prolonged **walking** strains the sinews (*jīn*).

Those who understand this can **harmonize blood and Qi**, ascending to **seven returns** (*qī fǎn*) and descending to **nine restorations** (*jiǔ huán*), refining the **True Primordial** (*zhēn yuán*), subduing the **golden essence** (*jīn yè*), so that **blood turns to milk**, **Qi becomes like clouds**, **bones harden like gold**, and **marrow condenses like frost**.

The **liver** stores the **soul** (*hún*). To **endure wrath** is to **subdue the yin**, and to **restrain joy** is to **nourish the yang** (*yǎng*). When **one yang** arises from **Child** (*zǐ*, 11 PM–1 AM) to **Si** (*sì*, 11 AM–1 PM), the **six yangs** reach their peak. For ordinary people, **True Qi** at its extreme **disperses**.

The **adept** (*dá shēng zhī shì*), however, observes this peak and **generates one yin internally** (*yīn jí yú hài*), letting the **six yins** culminate at **Hai** (*hài*, 11 PM–1 AM). Then, **one yang** is generated within. **Yin and yang** thus **propel each other**, perpetually giving rise without end, so the **soul is preserved** and the **essence restored**, aligning with heaven and earth eternally.

This is what **Dao**? It is the use of the **seven-day return** (*qī rì lái fù*) to **retrieve the soul** and **restore the spirit** (*shè hún huán pò*), refining the elixir and **forming the embryo** (*lián dān jié tāi*), so that one may **ascend to seven returns** and achieve **inverted reunion**.

- **First**, ascending to the brain (*nǎo*) forms **clouds** (*yún*);
- **Next**, passing through the bones (*gǔ*) solidifies **marrow** (*suǐ*). When marrow is full, bones become firm; when bones are firm, flesh grows; when flesh is solid, sinews relax; when sinews are fixed, blood flows and **vitality is replenished**; when blood is abundant, Qi is enhanced; when Qi surges, **hair and nails flourish**.

The **spleen** is the **Golden Terrace** (*jīn tái*), the **great root** of **Primordial Qi** (*yuán qì*), capable of **converting food into Qi**. Its vessel descends to the **Gate of Life** (*mìng mén*), located below the navel (*qí*) by **one inch and three divisions** (*sān fēn*), named the **Jade Ring** (*yù huán*), which is the **Lower Elixir Field** (*xià dān tián*).

What is the **Gate of Life**? It is the **portal of nature and destiny** (*xìng mìng zhī mén*), not solely the right kidney. Constantly **warming and nourishing** the **spleen-fire** (*pí huǒ*), ensuring the **earth-Qi** (*tǔ qì*) is plentiful, strengthens the body and secures its foundation.

When the **spleen is solid** and **Qi is full**, its face glows like **cinnabar** (*dān*). The spleen is long—**one foot**—and **concealed within the Great Granary** (*tài cāng*). If it is **robust and full**, all five viscera (*wǔ zàng*) are harmonized; if **weak**, the **four limbs** (*sì zhī*) wither.

Once, **Zhang Zhongding of the Buying Cave** (*Guài Yá Zǐ*), a man of **public song** (*gōng yǒng*), encountered **Mr. Xi Yi** (*xī yí*) in the heat of summer, **clinging to fire** (*fù huǒ*), wearing a **cotton cap** and **thick clothing** (*mián guān hòu nà*). He said: *"I guard one breath of Qi—unable to contend with the **transformative forces of nature** (*zào huà*)."*

The **gallbladder** is the **refined essence** of the **six palaces** (*liù fǔ*), governing all **Qi-forces** (*zhū qì lì*), and externally manifesting in the **pupils of the eyes** and the **bridge of the nose** (*mù tóng bì zhù*). Refining the **Three Primordial Qi** (*sān yuán zhī qì*), over time, the **luminous spirit** of the five viscera (*wǔ zàng*) shines like a torch at night (*yè zhú*).

When the **three souls** (*sān hún*) are **settled**, dreams vanish. The **three fields** (*sān tián*) each have their **chambers** (*shì*), each **one inch and two divisions** wide (*èr fēn*).

When **yang rushes forth** and **yin flees**, the **sages** liken it to **Dragon and Tiger** (*lóng hǔ*), for it is **difficult to subdue**.

The **three front gates** of the body are: the **nose** (*bí*), the **eyes** (*mù*), and the **heart** (*xīn*).
The **three rear gates** are: the **tailbone** (*wěi wèn*), the **back of the elbow** (*zhǒu hòu*), and the **vertebrae** (*zhuǎn lú*).

The **mouth**, the **hands**, and the **feet**—these are the **three outer gates** of the body.
Inhalation and exhalation, advance and retreat—**none may be omitted**.

He who knows the **three fields** stores and refines the **true qi of the North**, harvesting it at its proper time, returning it in measured cycles. Naturally, it transforms—this is the **great elixir of the Nine Mysterious Golden Liquids**.

The **Earthly Gate** is the **mouth**; the **Imperial Homeland** is the **third eye**; the **nose’s qi** flows clear outward and mysterious inward.

To **cultivate and ignite fire**, to **operate the River Chariot**—this is nothing but the **breath itself**.

Here, one refines the **saliva and fluids**, drawing them into the **Mysterious Palace**. The **lead and mercury of the kidneys** ascend the **Upper Path**, and thus the **upper and lower gates are sealed without leakage**—the **sage embryo** is then formed.

The **tongue’s extension and retraction**, the **rinsing of saliva and swallowing of fluids**, should flow like rivers—**uninterrupted within the five viscera**.

Nurturing the **three fields**, massaging the **six palaces**, securing the **spirit chamber**, closing the **evil gates**—thus, the **essence of the five viscera** is condensed, the **primordial cell of Great Transformation** is nourished, and the **qi dwells in the Spirit Palace**, the **elixir circulates in the brain**. This can **transform decay into vitality**.

When the **three fields** are fully refined, **precision is preserved and the embryo is stabilized**—naturally, the **three qi spiral rightward at the Brain Gate**, the **six yangs encircle leftward at the Heavenly Palace**. Above and below flow in harmony, the **hundred gates are all bright**, and the **nine orifices open fully**.

The **true qi of the North, the One of Rectitude**, governs the **two qi of the Dark Chamber and the Golden Room**—**Kan and Li**.

When **Kan and Li unite**, the **essences of sun and moon** naturally merge and converge in the **three fields**.

The **Golden Room’s Lower Primordial** is the **kidney organ**, named the **Sea of Longevity**.
If the **tailbone is not restrained**, the **Ocean will dry up**.
Thus it is said: **"For true longevity, one must be most cautious in the Chamber of Repose"**—this is what is meant!

Gazing inward at the **three chambers and nine rooms**, making **inner and outer spaces transparent**, one then **stores and swallows the jade fluids of the five teeth**—the **five teeth** are the **five viscera**.

Then, **closing the Gate of Life**, **locking the Golden Bolt**, **restraining the vital essence**—when the **lead and mercury are about to ascend**, one must **suppress their flight**.
**Lead** is the **gold in water**; when full, the **spirit wavers**.
**Mercury** is the **silver in fire**; when full, the **soul trembles**.

The **large intestine** is the **palace of the Jade Hall**; the **small intestine** is the **palace of Primordial Yang**; the **left shoulder** is the **palace of Great Harmony**; the **right bladder** is the **palace of Great Purity**; the **stomach** is the **palace of Central Yellow**; the **gallbladder** is the **palace of Supreme Clarity**.
Cultivate and govern them—**do not let them decay**; this is how it must be.

The **wise in life** first govern their **heart**.
When **agitation arises**, **calm it**; when **evil arises**, **correct it**; when **desire arises**, **suppress it with abandonment**; when **turbulence arises**, **clarify it with purity**.
Action and stillness rest here; **haste and deliberation** are here.
In time, **external things grow dim**, while **inner discernment sharpens**.
One does not **seek stillness** yet grows ever stiller; one does not **seek tranquility** yet grows ever more tranquil.
Thus, **movement and stillness are both forgotten**, and **Heavenly Purity finds its own ease**.

The **Five Phases**—**dispersed, they are five**; **united, they are one**.
**One** is **one qi**.
**One** is the **beginning of the Dao**, the **ancestor of the elixir**.
Thus, **Heaven with one yang descending gives birth to Reunion**; six descents give birth to **Qian**.
When **yang reaches its peak**, one **yin descends**, giving birth to **Pregnancy**; six descents give birth to **Kun**.
From the **eleventh month to the fourth month**, the hexagrams are **Reunion, Lin, Tai, Great Strength, Central Peace, Qian**.
From the **fifth to the tenth month**, the hexagrams are **Pregnancy, Pursuit, Opposition, Contemplation, Shedding, Kun**.

The **sage gathers and refines the true qi of Heaven and Earth**, dividing it into two bodies:
**One is lead**, the **second is mercury**.
Each **eight liang** makes **three hundred eighty-four fen**—**two fen and four fen make one liang**; three hundred eighty-four fen is one **jin**—this corresponds to the **hexagram lines**.

Gazing upward at the **Heavenly Way**, looking downward at the **water clocks**, one **evenly divides the fire’s duration**, seizing **eighteen hundred units of fire’s power** to **shed the mortal form**. This begins with **One** and ends with **One**.

The **fire’s duration for the Golden Elixir**—
When viewed from the **Mysterious Root**, it is the **division of Hunyuan**, where the **Three Powers are complete**, and the **four seasons shift**.
When viewed from the **inner landscape**, it is the **division of Hongmeng**, where the **three palaces are complete**, and **ten thousand phenomena arise**, with the **four seasons circulating**.

This is how **Heaven, Earth, and Man all arise from One**, is it not?

Its marvel lies in **uniting the three-five qi**, using the **nine-nine rhythms**.
What are **three-five**? **Water, fire, earth**.
Thus, **closing the Hidden Gate**, **refining the Eight Trigrams**, **dividing the Three Clarities**.

Its **father is the Mud Pillow**; its **mother is the Feminine One**, gathering the **three luminaries** and returning them to the **Chamber of the Son**—**spirit and essence are not lost**.

What are the **Eight Trigrams**?
**Nine above, one below**; **three on the left, seven on the right**; **two and four as shoulders**; **six and eight as feet**—this is what is meant.

What are the **Three Clarities**?
The **palace of the two kidneys**—its **left is the sun**, its **right is the moon**, and the **abode of the Dipper**—this is what is meant.

Within my body are **sun and moon**.
If I make them **soar high**, ascending to the **Mud Pillow**, traversing the **five viscera**, circulating through the **three palaces above and below without end**, then the **hundred bones will be firm** and the **marrow and essence plentiful**.

This is the **Way of the Yellow Court**.

What is the **Mysterious One**?
Refining the **yin spirit**, nurturing the **yang soul**, condensing the **Mysterious Pearl** and securing the **Sea of Essence**.

Common folk **refine yin with yang**—do they not **wither from vigor to old age**?
The **enlightened sage refines yang with yin**—do they not **return from old age to vigor**?

Those who **rinse and refine** first **close all the orifices**, then **turn the Red Dragon**, drawing upon the **jade fluids of the Jade Pool** to **nourish and augment** them, making **upper and lower regions communicate**—this is the **great medicine of embryonic fluids and fetal essence**.

What is **embryonic fluid**?
If I can **deeply support and firmly lock the North’s central region**, then the **three fields and nine orifices** will be **pure and undisturbed**, and **one fluid, one qi** will be condensed.

The *Classic* says:
*"Ascend to the heavens riding the Jade Wheel,
Day and night for seven days—do not sleep.
Why?*
The six yin and six yang,
The sevenfold cycle of inner alchemy’s fire—
This is the refining of the Golden Elixir.

Not sleeping means
Ever keeping one’s true thoughts serene and clear,
Lest the Spirit Platform grow dim.

The hundred grains—
The essence of earth and soil—
Can only nourish the form.

It is said:
*If you wish not to die, keep your intestines pure;
If you wish to live long, keep your intestines clear.*
Thus, one should eat the refined *Tàihé* qi.

To fill the belly,
First empty the mind.
The mind governs stillness,
Qi governs motion.
Thus, those attuned to the Dao
Soar beyond the cosmic expanse while their minds remain tranquil,
Rest within the infinitesimal yet keep their qi ever flowing.

Only through stillness can one align with the utmost void;
When the void reaches its peak, it becomes luminous;
When luminous, it becomes clear;
When clear, it becomes penetrating—
Then nothing in heaven and earth can escape the square inch of the heart.

The mind is the dwelling of the spirit;
The eyes are the spirit’s window.
When the mind moves, the eyes open;
When the mind stirs not, the eyes close.
Thus, by day, the light shines forth,
By night, it is concealed—
This harmonizes the *huā jīng* (flowering essence),
Balancing yin and yang.

The *róng* and *wèi* circulate through the six extremes,
Concealed at the *mǎo-yǒu* (hour of the hare and rooster),
Stored in the two kidneys.
The left is the *Yùfáng* (Jade Chamber), where the *Tàihé True Person* resides;
The right is the *Jīnshì* (Golden Hall), where the *Tàixuán Jade Maiden* dwells.

The Big Dipper—
Within, four ministers;
Without, three ladles—
Ever mingling with the *Qìhǎi* (Sea of Qi).
The *Qìhǎi* is the position of the *Hidden Dragon* at *Chǐzǐ* (first hexagram).

The *Classic* says:
*Knowing how to guard the male with the female ensures no aging—why?*
The male is the *Fire Dragon*,
Which delights in consuming *zǐjīn huángyá* (purple gold and yellow buds),
Its nature ever restless and unceasing.
The female is the *Water Tiger*,
Which delights in consuming *hóngyín bái xuě* (red silver and white snow),
Its nature ever roaming without fixity.

Those attuned to the Dao
Make the Dragon and Tiger mate in secret,
Feeding them with *zǐjīn huángyá*,
Nourishing them with *hóngyín bái xuě*—
Thus, the male clings to the female,
The Tiger lies low, the Dragon hides—
Then winds and rains follow their order,
And the work of heaven and earth is complete.

When the mind’s essence is focused,
Its inner self does not falter,
Uniting the three burners above,
Descending the jade nectar below,
Drawing moisture from the *Xuānyīng* (Mysterious Belly),
Entering the *Míngtáng* (Bright Hall),
Irrigating the throat—
Then the spirit’s clarity is restored.

This is how
The lower elixir must first be refined,
Then the primal fluid is boiled above—
Making yin exhausted while yang flourishes,
Fire drawn forth while water is replenished,
In an endless cycle.

How does one draw the moisture?
Stirring beneath the tongue makes the waves rise full—
Swallowing sends it to the *Dānhǎi* (Elixir Sea).

When the great work nears completion,
The outer *xiéguān* (obstacle gate) is sealed,
The inner *Mìngmén* (Gate of Life) is unlocked?
The lungs govern the *róng* and *wèi*—
In the kidneys, this is *jīnshuǐ xiāngshēng* (metal-water mutual generation),
The way of parent and child.

Performing thirty-six swallows at the *Yùtí* (Jade Pool)
Opens all the vessels and enriches the blood.

What are the *seven returns*?
Rising to the brain, they form clouds;
Descending to the mouth, they form water;
Passing through the lungs, they form saliva;
Passing through the heart, they form blood;
Passing through the liver, they form essence;
Passing through the spleen, they form fluids;
Passing through the kidneys, they form the two vessels—
The refined yin essence and yang purity.

The *Jīnjīn Yùyè* (Golden Fluid, Jade Dew)
Are born of yin and yang.

If one ascends through seven returns,
Entering the two kidneys,
Descending through nine cycles,
Reaching the brain,
Endlessly circulating above and below—
Then this is the *Qiónggāo Yùshuāng* (Jade Paste, Pearl Frost).

As the great work takes root,
The primal qi becomes full and substantial,
The eight pure fluids flow freely,
The kidneys receive the essence,
Penetrating the five viscera,
Then the *jiǔjiǔ* (eighty-one) true fire is kindled—
When the qi is full and the moment is ripe, the Golden Elixir is complete.

---
**The Tàijí Chapter**
The body has a *horizontal津* (moisture),
The root of the *Tàijí*.
Preserve the *central yellow* (middle essence),
And the form may endure.

The *Shùyáng Child* said:
Humans receive the *central qi* to live,
Sharing the same origin as heaven and earth.

The *Yì* says:
*The Yì* has the *Tàijí*,
From which the two principles arise.
The *Tàijí* is the great centrality.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* says:
Humans receive the centrality of heaven and earth to live—
This is called *command* (fate).

When forming in the womb,
The kidneys first receive the shape,
Then the five viscera arise—
Thus, the kidneys are the *Gate of Life*.

The left is *Shàoyáng* (Lesser Yang),
Heaven, the Sun;
The right is *Tàiyín* (Greater Yin),
Earth, the Moon—
This is how the *Tàijí* of the body first divides and takes form.

Heaven and earth endure long
Because the *Tàijí* remains constant;
Humans achieve longevity and clarity
Because the central qi is not lost.

Thus, ancient sages spoke of nurturing life
By cultivating the *Huángtíng* (Yellow Court) of the body.
*Huáng* is the color of centrality;
*Tíng* is where centrality is born.
It lies directly between the two kidneys.

Above, it reaches the *Húntíng* (Soul Court), which is the spleen;
Below, it reaches *Guānyuán* (Pass Gate), the *Qìhǎi* (Sea of Qi).
Three inches above and below the navel,
Front to *Shēngmén* (Life Gate), back to *Mìhù* (Secret Door).
*Shēngmén* is the navel;
*Mìhù* is the *Jīngshì* (Essence Chamber).

Within, the qi and fluids circulate,
Ascending to the *Níhuán* (Mud Pellet),
Descending to the *Héngduān* (Horizontal End).
The *Sān Yuán Jiǔ Gōng* (Three Origins, Nine Palaces),
The *Bā Zhēn Èrshísǎng* (Eight Truths, Twenty-Four Scenes)
All take the *Huángtíng* as their master.

Just as humans have the *Huángtíng*,
Heaven and earth have the *Tàijí*—
This is what the *Lǎozi* called the *Gǔshén* (Valley Spirit).

What is the *Gǔshén*?
*Gǔ* speaks of the void where the spirit is stored.

The *Xuānpìn* (Mysterious Female) are the two kidneys.
The left is *Xuān* (Mysterious), the color of heaven;
The right is *Pìn* (Female), the nature of earth.
The breathing of heaven and earth enters here—
Thus it is said:
*The root of heaven and earth*
*Endures like a thread,*
*Using it without strain—*
This is called *tāixī* (embryonic breathing).

---

To cultivate it properly is to keep it ever-present without loss—
Thus one may stand alongside Heaven and Earth.

Yet how could cultivation be easy?
There must be a Way to it.

In essence:
The movement and application do not exceed the mind,
Preservation and storage do not exceed the kidneys,
Nourishment and harmonization do not exceed the spleen,
Attaining unity, guarding stillness, and accumulating strength over time—
Then success is inevitable.

Thus the Way of cultivation
Takes *mìnsè zhēnqì* (conserving true *qi* in secrecy) as its foundation—
Wasting and leaking are its greatest taboos.

The *Classic* says:
*"Close the Command Gate, preserve the Jade Capital—*
*At a hundred years, you shall be drunk with life, with surplus years.*
How could one not take heed!"

I observe that three inches below the navel is the *Héngjīn* (Horizontal Ferry),
Where it transforms into *jīngshuǐ* (essence-water),
Flowing outward if unchecked.
To seal it lies only in *chóngmì* (double secrecy)—
Double secrecy ensures the *qi* and essence circulate.
This is my true *qi*—
How could one not guard it with utmost diligence?

---
**Fire and Candling Section**
The foundation of *nèidān* (internal alchemy) relies on fire to complete;
The *zhōutiān* (circulation) must not deviate from its proper course.

The *Zhì Yóuzǐ* (Master of the Ultimate) said:
*"Close the breath twenty-four times—*
*The number suffices; exhale and close again.*
Using the *Red Dragon* to stir right seven times,
Left nine times, rinsing sixteen times,
Grinding the teeth twice—
Then divide into three swallows:
First right, then left, then center—
This is the *yīn yáo* (yin principle).

Close the breath thirty-six times—
The number suffices; exhale and close again.
Using the *Red Dragon* to stir left seven times,
Right nine times, rinsing thirty-three times,
Grinding the teeth three times—
Then three swallows:
First left, then right, then center—
This is the *yáng yáo* (yang principle).

In total, close the breath one hundred ninety-two times,
Refining with *huǒ èr bā* (fire two eights)—
This is what is meant by *fire and candling*.

---
**Water and Fire Section #3**
Fire originally governs Heaven, water originally governs Earth;
One ascends, one descends—
Thus their function is *jìjì* (completed).

The *Zhì Yóuzǐ* said:
*"The human body has three *sānmi* (trigrammatic) fires:
The first is *jūn huǒ* (Sovereign Fire), the *shàngmi* (upper trigrammatic), which is the heart;
The second is *chén huǒ* (Minister Fire), the *zhōngmi* (middle trigrammatic), which is the kidneys;
The third is *mín huǒ* (Common Fire), the *xiàmì* (lower trigrammatic), which is the bladder.

Now, what we practice are the *chángshēng huǒ* (long-life fires) and the *zhōutiān huǒ* (circulation fires).
If one does not know the laws of contraction and dispersion,
This fire will flare upward and become a calamity.

Did not the ancient poem say:
*'Originally from striking stones for light,*
*It led to baking Heaven with heat.'*
Is this not the case?

In essence, fire cannot be absent—
Greatly, it can eliminate the *sānshī* (Three Corpses) and achieve immortality;
Slightly, it can dispel the *jiǔchóng* (Nine Worms) and prevent illness.
Yet one must know how to return it to its source.

Who understands the function of water?
Water in the body becomes sweat, tears, blood, urine, semen, saliva, and spittle—
These are the many ways water flows outward in the body.

Within, the brain is the *zuìhǎi* (marrow sea),
The heart is the *xuèhǎi* (blood sea),
The *dāntián* is the *qìhǎi* (qi sea),
The spleen and stomach are the *shuǐgǔ zhīhǎi* (sea of water and grain).
The hundred bones are like rivers converging into the four seas—
When the four seas flow freely, the rivers will be fully replenished.

*Zhuāngzǐ* said:
*"The nature of water is unmixed, it is clear;
Unmoved, it is level—
If stagnant and unflowing, it cannot be clear."*

Thus it is said:
*"A door hinge never rots, flowing water never putrefies—*
*This is their principle."*

*Liú Gāoshàng* composed the *Huófǎ* (Method of Revival) based on this.
*Sū Shì* resided at the *Báiè Zhīfēng* (White Crane Peak),
Inspired by the *rǔquán* (breast spring) to compose a poem—
Its meaning is profound.
Alas, many can speak of it but cannot practice.

Thus, the scholar must now understand the method of *shuǐhuǒ jìjì* (Water-Fire Completion).

Fire in the heart is *xìng* (nature),
Water in the kidneys is *mìng* (fate)—
These two truly depend on each other to complete.

The kidneys’ water, without the heart’s fire to nourish,
Cannot ascend.
The heart’s fire, without the kidneys’ water to store,
Cannot descend.

To long-nourish and complete, reaching the uppermost, lowest, and lateral extremes,
Penetrating the *sānyuán jiǔgōng* (Three Origins, Nine Palaces),
The five *zàng* (viscera) and hundred *jié* (nodes)—
Only then can one preserve and endure eternally.

Thus *Cuī Zǐ* said:
*"Within stillness, if water and fire penetrate,*
*Then one is an immortal who does not die."*

---
**Kànlí (Abysmal and Bright) Section**
*Juéyīn* (Concealed Yin) generates *kǎn* (Abyss),
*Juéyáng* (Concealed Yang) generates *lí* (Brightness);
Deeply understanding their use
Lays the foundation for prolonged vision.

The *Zhì Yóuzǐ* explained:
*"Heaven and Earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *lǐ* (miles).
In the human body, the heart is Heaven,
The kidneys are Earth—
Separated by eight inches and four *fèn* (divisions),
Matching the numbers of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, when Heaven’s *qi* descends, the heart’s *qi* descends to the kidneys—
The kidneys are *kǎn*.
When Earth’s *qi* ascends, the kidneys’ *qi* ascends to the heart—
The heart is *lí*.

When Heaven and Earth harmonize, all things are born;
When *kǎn* and *lí* are completed, the *huángyá* (yellow sprout) emerges.

By analogy:
*Lí* is yang, thus *kǎn* is yin;
*Lí* is the sun, thus *kǎn* is the moon;
*Lí* is fire, thus *kǎn* is water;
*Lí* is nature, thus *kǎn* is fate;
*Lí* is the dragon, thus *kǎn* is the tiger;
*Lí* is odd, thus *kǎn* is even;
*Lí* is lead, thus *kǎn* is mercury;
*Lí* is fluid, thus *kǎn* is *qi*.

In ancient times, *Hǎi Chánzǐ* said:
*"The Five Phases and Four Symbols are the essence of *kǎn* and *lí*."*

I observe that the *rìhún yuèpò* (soul of the sun, spirit of the moon)
Follow each other day and night without pause—
Nature and fate are inseparably linked,
Yet most people remain unaware.

If one can clarify the ascending and descending movements of Heaven and Earth,
Understand the proper conjunction of sun and moon,
Generate fluid from *qi*, generate *qi* from fluid,
Hold yin within yang, hold yang within yin—
Then *kǎn* and *lí* will be complete.

This crucial key is rarely known by mortals.

*Mǎ Zìrán* encountered thousands of *fāngwài shì* (outer sect adepts) in his life,
Yet their teachings were nothing more than
Swallowing saliva, circulating *qi*, practicing *tāixī* (embryonic breathing),
And refining the *zhōutiān huǒhòu* (fire and candling of circulation).

At sixty-four years old, he met *Hǎi Chánzǐ*—
Then, suddenly enlightened, he realized all his previous teachings were incorrect.

---

So then, what is the essential method?

There are the **Two-Eight Elixirs** passed through furnace and crucible,
Where Dragon and Tiger copulate ten thousand times without ceasing—
Then the Great Elixir is thus perfected.

Master Lü’s verse says:
*"If someone asks me of the method for longevity,
I know it lies beyond the wheel of Heaven’s sun and moon."*
Truly profound words!

The **Jiǎ-Gēng Chapter** states:
East and West fixed in position, metal and wood clearly manifest;
At **Yín** and **Shēn**, refining has its method.

**Yóuzǐ** says:
Many discuss the **Zǐ-Wǔ** (Child-Midday) practice.
**Zǐ** is the water of **North Kǎn**, the **Tàiyuán** essence.
I observe the celestial patterns—
Above, it connects to the **Xuányáng**’s tread,
Residing in the **Nǚxū-Wēi** constellations,
Below, it responds to the wilds of **Qí**,
In the human body, it corresponds to the **kidneys**.
Examined through the **guàqi** (trigram-energy), it is the **Fù** hexagram—
The moment when **one yang** first stirs.

**Wǔ** is the fire of **South Lí**, the **Yángmíng** essence.
I observe the celestial patterns—
Above, it connects to the **Zhēnhuǒ**’s tread,
Residing in the **Liǔxīng-Zhāng** constellations,
Below, it responds to the wilds of **Zhōu**,
In the human body, it corresponds to the **heart**.
Examined through the **guàqi**, it is the **Guì** hexagram—
The moment when **one yin** first stirs.

Though **Zǐ** is yin, one yang is born within—
This is called **"yin within yang."**
Though **Wǔ** is yang, one yin is born within—
This is called **"yang within yin."**
This is what scholars commonly know.

Practitioners, when **one yang** first moves and **original qi** ascends,
All know to **grasp the perineum, tuck the knees**,
**Raise the body, advance the fire**,
Circulate **metallic essence** into the **marrow sea**,
Fill **spiritual water** at the **high source**,
Let the nasal breath be soft and continuous,
Internally settle the spirit-mind—
Until **Chǒu**, when they pause,
Waiting for **original qi** to transmit to **Tíngwǔ**,
Where it merges with **heart-fire**—
This is the **interaction of water and fire**.

When **one yin** first moves and **fluid-blood** converges,
All know to **tuck the feet, fold the hands**,
Settle the heart-mind, let the nasal breath be soft and continuous,
Fill the mouth with saliva—
**Do not swallow, do not spit**—
Circulate **heart-fire** upward to merge with **jade fluid**,
Exchange **heart-kidney qi**,
Achieve the **Jiǔjì** (Completion) effect—
Until **Wèi**, when they pause,
Waiting for **heart-blood** to transmit to **Hài-Zǐ**,
Where it merges with **kidney-water**—
This is the **return of water and fire to their origins**.

Silently turning the alchemical wheel,
They believe they can practice **Zǐ-Wǔ** and unite **Dragon and Tiger**.

Those who practice the **Zǐ-Wǔ** method
Seek to unite **Dragon and Tiger** and return the **Great Elixir**.
Yet **Dragon and Tiger** cannot be made to copulate without first being born—
Thus, the **Zǐ-Wǔ** practice must begin with **nurturing Dragon and Tiger**,
And its subtlety lies in **refining Jiǎ-Gēng**.

Let us examine this thoroughly.

What is **refining Jiǎ-Gēng**?
Some say **Jiǎ** resides in **Yín**—
**Yín** is where fire is born and reigns in **Wǔ**,
The essence of **southern bundling**—
This is the method of **fluid-blood transformation**,
Where the **yang Dragon** is born—
Thus, **Jiǎ** must be refined at **Yín**.

**Gēng** resides in **Shēn**—
**Shēn** is where water is born and reigns in **Zǐ**,
The essence of **western-northern bundling**—
This is the method of **essence-blood transformation**,
Where the **yin Tiger** is born—
Thus, **Gēng** must be refined at **Shēn**.

This is where **Dragon and Tiger** are born,
Yet they do not know the mystery of **how to birth Dragon and Tiger**.

Fire is born in **Yín** and reigns in **Wǔ**,
Yet it later receives gestation and nourishment in **Chǒu**.
Water is born in **Shēn** and reigns in **Zǐ**,
Yet it also receives gestation and nourishment in **Chǒu**.
Nothing exists without first being gestated and nourished before it can be born and reign.

Ancients practicing the **Zǐ** method paused at **Chǒu**—
**Chǒu-Yín** is the **northern bundling** hexagram,
Both residing in the **Gèn** palace,
Their energies balanced, transmission swift.

At the start of **Chǒu**, **spiritual water** gradually descends to the **Huápó** (Jade Pool).
One must **stir with the tongue at the upper palate**,
Practice **swallowing at the double-story tower**—
Once **jade fluid** flows, ascending to the **double-story tower**,
Then **Jiǎ’s wood** receives **jade fluid** and transmits nourishment.
When **Jiǎ** is nourished, **liver-wood** is born,
And **liver-wood** transmits to the **heart**—
At this point, **heart-fire** reigns.
Thus, when **jade fluid** transmits to **Wǔ** and stirs **heart-fire**,
It transforms into **blood**—
This is the **yang Dragon**.

Practicing the **Wǔ** method, they pause at **Wèi**—
**Wèi-Shēn** is the **southwestern bundling** hexagram,
Both residing in the **Kūn** palace,
Their energies balanced, transmission swift.

At **Wèi**, the **true elixir** gathers in the **golden crucible**,
Then the nasal breath enters more than it exits,
Consolidating **true fire** in the **spleen-earth**.
Once **true fire** transmits and nourishes **spleen-earth**,
Then **Gēng’s metal** receives **spleen-earth** and transmits nourishment.
When **Gēng** is nourished, **lung-metal** is born,
And **lung-metal** transmits to the **kidneys**—
At this point, **kidney-water** reigns.
Thus, **heart-blood** transmits to **Zǐ** and stirs **yin-qi**,
Transforming into **essence**—
This is the **yin Tiger**.

Therefore, **Tàibái Zhēnrén** sings:
*"Five Phases inverted in technique,
Dragon emerges wrapped in fire,
Yin and yang move out of sequence,
Tiger is born within water."*

Master Lü says:
*"The yang Dragon returns to emerge from the Lí palace,
The yin Tiger remains born from the Kǎn position."*

The *Tàishàng Nèirìyuè Jīng* states:
*"Original qi enters the heart and transforms into blood.
Blood is the source of essence, the mother of spirit—
When it flows into the yin of the kidney palace, it transforms into essence."*

Truly, the mystery of **refining Jiǎ-Gēng to birth Dragon and Tiger**
Fundamentally lies in **Chǒu-Wèi**!

Yet **spiritual water** descending to the **Huápó** is called **jade fluid**,
And practicing **swallowing at Chǒu**—
How is this verified?

The *Língbǎo Dàoyào* says:
*"Gazing eastward toward Fúsāng at dawn,
Raising the body before sunrise,
Gradually passing the double-story tower,
Galloping the celestial steed repeatedly,
The universe’s youth—
Halting at Yángzhōu."*

**Gèn** is the **youth**.
**Yángzhōu** is the land of **Chǒu**.
I observe the celestial patterns—
**Chǒu** above connects to the **Xīngjì**’s entanglement,
Residing in the **Dòu-Niú-Nǚ** constellations,
Below, it corresponds to the land of **Yángzhōu**.

Zhang Ping-shu’s poem says:
*"The golden tripod holds no cinnabar-wrapped mercury,
The jade pool first descends silver into the water—*
Thus, the practice of swallowing at **Chǒu** is made clear.

Yet when **liquid-blood** gathers in the golden tripod, it is called **true medicine**,
And practicing **nurturing fire** at **Wèi**—
How is this verified?

The *Língbǎo Dàoyào* says:
*"To gather medicine, rely on the **Jade Rabbit**,
To consummate the union, it must be at **Huángpó**,
Awaiting **Yōngzhōu** to meet—
Presenting a *Yánggē* song in tribute.*

Again it says:
*"Why does the southwest fire enter **Yōngzhōu**?"*

The **Jade Rabbit** is the **metallic essence**;
**Huángpó** is the **spleen-earth**.
Its position is **Kūn’s southwest**.
**Yōngzhōu** is the land of **Wèi**.
I observe the celestial patterns—
**Wèi** above connects to the **Quánshǒu’s** entanglement,
Residing in the **Jǐng-Gǔi-Liǔ** constellations,
Below, it corresponds to the land of **Yōngzhōu**.

Zhang Ping-shu’s poem says:
*"To know the birthplace of the medicine’s stream,
Look only to the southwest—its native land."*
Thus, the practice of nurturing fire at **Wèi** is made clear.

Truly, the mystery of **refining Jiǎ-Gēng to birth Dragon and Tiger**
Lies in its alchemical completion—
And its fruition is realized at **Zǐ-Wǔ**.

To practice the **Zǐ-Wǔ** method while unaware of this critical principle—
How could one ever achieve transformation?

Though the enlightened cultivate through gradual refinement,
Unlocking the **passages**—
It is not achieved in a single day.

To penetrate the **subtle mysteries** and exchange the **common body**,
One’s awakening must have its cause.

I have weighed its truth and say:
*"Channel the **River Vehicle’s** pure *qi*,
Declare at the **Tail** and **Hearth**, between the **Spine’s** ribs,
Pierce the **Jade Capital**,
Harmonize the **Two Substances**,
At the **Mudball**, return to the **Great Elixir**,
At the **Elixir**, seize the **Creative Power’s** authority—
Thus attaining the **Way of Eternal Life**—
It is nothing but refining **Jiǎ-Gēng**,
Is it not profound?"

*Volume Eight of the Dao Gun*
*Collected by the wandering scholar Zēng Cù*

**Kunlun Chapter**
At the peak of Kunlun stands the **Mudball**—
The abode of a hundred deities, the gate of ascent.
The Wandering Scholar says: *"I was taught by the Most High that the Dao is One alone.
Is this the True One you speak of?"*
The *Huángtíng Scripture* declares: *"If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun."*
For Kunlun is the Mudball—
Like heaven itself.
When yin does not ascend and yang does not descend, it is bound to the world—
Unable to create and transform.
In the human body, it cannot circulate without end,
Nor flow in harmony with Heaven and Earth.
Thus it is said: *"The upward path—no thousand sages dare transmit it.*
Only my True One suffices."*

Master Huán Kǎi once received the Dao from the Immortal Lord Lǐ Huán,
And took *Huán* as his surname.
The Immortal Lord said: *"External elixirs, flying steps, hidden forms,
The interplay of Kǎn and Lí—you have mastered these all,
Yet you have not heard the Great Dao.
He who silently worships the Most High
Opens the gate of ascent—
Only then may he transcend the Land of Eternal Day,
And return to the Elixir of Immortal Souls.
The Jade Spring issues from Kunlun’s mountain,
The Golden Elixir from the Realm of Sun and Moon.
Its mountain—though but a span in height,
A handful in breadth—
Houses the Three Sovereigns,
The abode of a hundred deities.
To grasp this method, to worship the True Ten Thousand times,
With pure practice complete—
Ascend to the Purple Clouds,
All within the span of an inch.

Between the brows lies the Gate of Divine Light,
The Jade Gate and Golden Pillars converse yet remain sealed—
Only by attaining the Secret Words and Sacred Texts may one arrive.

Within the body dwell thirty-six thousand luminous spirits,
Twelve thousand sovereigns of soul and shadow,
And in the Mudball, the Great Sovereign of Immortal Life.
The Two Principles, Four Symbols, Eight Trigrams, Nine Officials,
The Square Inch and the Hollow Gourd—
All are complete, none lacking.
Beneath Kunlun, the Sun and Moon flow,
Their radiance scattering in the Golden Pool.
Gold corresponds internally to the lungs,
The lungs externally to the nose;
Wood corresponds internally to the liver,
The liver externally to the eyes.
When the eyes follow the five colors, they grow blind;
When the nose pursues the five scents, it becomes clogged.
Gold and Wood divided, the radiance flees the outer gate,
The Divine Pearl scatters—
Thus does one reach death.

But he who reverses the Sun and Moon’s brilliance,
Illuminating the Kunlun of the Supreme Ultimate—
What Dao is this?
My left and right eyes are the Sun and Moon.
When they shine through the twelve hours,
The Celestial Gate opens,
True Immortals arrive, and one returns to childlike purity.
In three years, the Yellow Cloud forms;
In a thousand days, the Sacred Embryo is complete;
In nine years, one ascends the Golden Gate;
In twelve years, the Three Platforms.
Thus, the Dragon and Tiger naturally unite.
The Most High rests upon the Golden Terrace,
All deities long to gaze upon the Celestial Tablet.

The Immortal Lord then instructed Kǎi:
*"You have received the Sacred Texts.
Let your heart be as dead ashes.
After twelve years of practice,
You shall ascend the Immortal Ladder—
White Light arises from the Rounded Form,
Purple Qi surges through the Clouds,
And your lifespan shall match that of Heaven and Earth."*
Kǎi bowed in reception.

The Immortal Lord further expounded:
*"Internal illumination returns the Soul-Light,
The Supreme One embraces True Fragrance,
Perfume drifts through the Valley of Flowers,
Lush grows the Purple Chamber,
The Celestial Gate opens to the Azure Expanse—
Silently worship the Jade Emperor,
And know that the Soul-Light shines within,
The inner realm clear and bright.
I observe the symbol of Zhú Qián—
A white crown emerging from the Rounded Light,
Seated upon a Treasure Lotus—
Thus, the Dao is complete.
Buddha and Lao are not so different."*

**Chapter on Nourishing Qi**
Strengthen with grain, refine with *qi*;
Strength brings decay, *qi* brings eternal life.
The Wandering Scholar says: *"Man draws upon Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi* to live,
Thus inhalation and exhalation correspond within and without.
The Six *Qi* govern the five viscera,
The remaining *qi* envelops the Triple Burner.
If one masters this *qi*,
In one year, *qi* flows freely;
In two years, *qi* circulates;
In three years, *qi* condenses into the Mysterious Pearl.
*Qi* is the Dao;
The Dao is emptiness;
Emptiness is spontaneity;
Spontaneity is non-action;
Non-action is the mind.
When the mind does not move—why?
For if the inner mind does not stir, the outer world does not enter;
If inner and outer are tranquil, the spirit harmonizes;
If the spirit harmonizes, *qi* harmonizes;
If *qi* harmonizes, primordial *qi* naturally replenishes;
If primordial *qi* replenishes, the five viscera are nourished;
If the five viscera are nourished, the hundred vessels flow;
If the hundred vessels flow, the fluids ascend;
If the fluids ascend, the five tastes vanish,
Hunger and thirst cease—
Thus does one reverse aging and return to youth.

At first, *qi* transforms into blood,
Blood into essence,
Essence into spirit.
In one year, *qi* renews;
In two years, blood renews;
In three years, the vessels renew;
In four years, flesh renews;
In five years, marrow renews;
In six years, sinews renew;
In seven years, bones renew;
In eight years, hair renews;
In nine years, form renews.
Thirty-six thousand spirits dwell within the body,
Transformed into an Immortal.

The spirit is the most refined, formless essence.
Thus, the spirit draws from the Dao,
In stillness aligning with nature;
Man draws from the spirit,
In motion aligning with emotion.
Hence, following nature, the spirit condenses;
Prolonged, the spirit stirs;
Extreme, the spirit departs;
Stirring brings life;
Departure brings death—
All moved by emotion, not by the spirit’s will.

The practitioner of *qi*-nourishment,
With a single thought, lifts the spirit beyond the Three Realms,
Descends to Kunlun’s Hill,
Enters the Vermilion Palace,
Pierces the Gushing Spring,
Causing primordial *qi* to revolve endlessly.
The *Scripture* says: *"When primordial *qi* flows freely, the Dao of Non-Death is attained."*

**Chapter on Nourishing Mist**
The essence of Heaven and Earth disperses as mist;
Feeding upon its refined essence,
The form may be preserved.

**Chapter on Binding Mist: The Instruction of Lady Yufu**

Lady Yufu of the Bound Sashes once told Zhang Weizi: *"I possess a method for nourishing mist."* Weizi replied: *"May I humbly inquire what you mean?"* Lady Yufu said: *"Mist is the refined essence of mountains and marshes, the overflowing *qi* of metals and stones. Prolonged practice can dissolve the form and merge it with emptiness, uniting with clouds in substance."*

Weizi said: *"May I humbly ask for the method?"* Lady Yufu replied: *"At the very beginning of dawn, I sit or lie as I please. First, I close my eyes, then internally observe the Five *Zàng*-organs. Afterward, I exhale *qi* through my mouth twenty-four times, until I perceive the Five-Colored *qi* swirling above my *chǐzhái* [cubic inch of space], drawn into the Jade Pool within me fifty times. I swallow the saliva likewise. Then, I pray:

*'The Great Sun shines forth,
Clouds and mists scatter in four directions.
*Qi* condenses, curving and coiling,
Five-Colored *qi* fills the Celestial Caverns.
The spirit and *qi* harmonize, opening in union,
Refining the true essence of metals and stones.
The fragrant *qi* fills the purple void,
Cultivating the form to preserve it whole.
Emerging from the hidden, concealed in the profound,
The Five Spirits dissolve and transform.
Uniting with the luminous, fanning the numinous,
At the right moment, ascending on the Six Clouds.
Gathering and containing my body,
I rise to the Nine Heavens.'*

Having finished, I again grind my teeth seven times, swallow the saliva seven times. Prolonged and steady practice enables one to ride upon clouds and mists and depart."*

**Chapter on Inner Vision**
Within the one body,
There exists a spirit overseeing it;
The heart at peace, the spirit tranquil,
Then the form does not decay.

Master Liangqiuzi said: *"The Yellow Court refers to the brain, the heart, and the spleen."* The *Scripture* says: *"The Heart-strings dance in triple layers, refining the Heavenly Embryo."* Why is this so?

The *Scripture* says: *"Qín, harmony; dié, accumulation. Preserve the Three Dantian, making harmony and accumulation as one. Tái xiān (the Heavenly Embryo) is tái xī (Embryonic Breathing)—like the embryo in the womb, having qi but no breath."*

The *Scripture* says: *"Seven dishes of jade keys seal the two gates. Why? The seven orifices open and close like gates and keys; used in accordance with the Dao, they are not opened recklessly."* The two gates are the eyes when storing spirit and closing them.

The *Scripture* says: *"Layer upon layer, the Golden Pass sealed, the pivot mechanism hidden. Why? Guard the spirit and essence without dissipation."*

The *Scripture* says: *"The Soul’s Platform steadfast, never exhausted. Why? The heart is the Soul’s Platform. If divine spirit resides within it, stillness preserves unity, movement stores spirit—when spirit is whole, the body is at ease, thus never exhausted."*

The *Scripture* says: *"The Central Peak of Heaven, refined with meticulous care. Why? The Central Peak of Heaven is the nose. Counting and pressing its left and right sides balances the qi—this is called irrigating the Central Peak."*

The *Scripture* says: *"Within the dwelling, there is true clothing of cinnabar. If one can truly see it, there will be no illness. Why? The Master of Original Yang said: ‘If one constantly preserves the heart-spirit, there will be no sickness.’"*

The *Scripture* says: *"Obscured and dense, the Dao-smoke governs purity and turbidity. Why? Obscured and dense is the wood symbol. Fire brings forth smoke, yang brings forth clear qi—clearness brings bright eyes, turbidity brings dimness."*

The *Scripture* says: *"The Palace of the Heart contains a lotus bearing flowers, governing the harmonious balance of cold and heat, nourishing and defense. Why? Cold and heat are the static and agitated qi of yin and yang. When one maintains harmony, nourishing and defense flow through the body—just as Laozi said: ‘Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat; purity and tranquility are the true essence of the world.’"*

The *Scripture* says: *"Externally, the mouth and tongue emit the Five Flowers; at the brink of death, calling them brings revival. Why? The heart governs the mouth and tongue, inhaling and exhaling the essences of the Five Zang, distinguishing the flavors of the Five Phases. When illness arises, one must preserve the Cinnabar Field, summoning a child in red robe and crimson cap to rescue."*

The *Scripture* says: *"The Palace of the Liver is wrapped in emerald layers, governing the opening of all gates and the clarity of perception. Why? The origin of Green Yang begins with the eyes—the gates and mirrors of the Five Phases."*

The *Scripture* says: *"Gather the soul, return the spirit—eternally unshaken. Why? On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the moon, the three souls wander outside as corpses. To retrieve them, one must gaze upward, remove the pillow, stretch the feet, clasp the hands over the heart, close the eyes, hold the breath three times, and tap the teeth three times. Then, storing the heart, a red qi like a parrot emerges from within at the throat. As the red qi grows larger, it envelops the body and transforms into fire, burning the body. Upon awakening, the body feels smaller, and if hot, one calls the names of the three souls: *Shuangling, Taiguang, Youjing*, and whispers: *‘The Celestial Micro Palace, the Central Yellow Beginning with Green. Refining the three souls, Taiguang is at peace. The Divine Treasure Chamber, rebirth with me. Do not move recklessly; the Overseer is the Most Spiritual. If you wish to fly, ascend to Shangqing. If hungry or thirsty, drink the Jade Elixir.’*

On the new moon, full moon, and dark moon, the seven po (spirits) wander. One must sleep on the back, stretch the feet, cover the ears with the palms so the fingers meet at the neck, hold the breath seven times, tap the teeth seven times, and store the heart at the nose-tip. A white qi as large as a bean appears, gradually expanding into nine layers over the body. The qi suddenly forms two Azure Dragons in the eyebrows, a White Tiger on either side of the nose, a Vermilion Bird above the heart, and a Spirit Serpent beneath the left foot. Two jade maidens in brocade robes, each holding a flame, stand at the ear gates. Afterward, swallow saliva seven times, calling the names of the seven po: *‘Shīgǒu, Fúshǐ, Qiǎoyīn, Tūnzéi, Fēidú, Yīnhuì, Chòufèi,’* and chant: *‘Pure qi returns nine times, subduing the rogue po. Heavenly Huntsman guards the gate, the maiden holds the key. Refining the soul and softening it, let it dwell with me in peace. Do not move recklessly; observe the form and face. If hungry or thirsty, drink the Elixir of Sun and Moon.’"*

The *Scripture* says: *"The Palace of the Kidneys is the Mysterious Gate, round and vast, containing a youthful True One of Upper Mysteriousness, governing the Six Palaces and the source of the Nine Fluids, externally manifesting as the green essence of the two ears. Why? Upper Mysteriousness is the heart. Its qi connects with the kidneys, so the Five Zang, Six Fu, and Nine Fluids intermingle, and the hundred vessels flow—none can be neglected. The Nine Fluids are the essences of the nine orifices. The Kidney Palace governs the ears; if its qi weakens, yin invades yang, but harmony ensures the hundred vessels and fluids flow freely. When kidney qi is abundant, the ears and eyes are sharp, and yang does not decline."*

The *Scripture* says: *"The two Water Kings face the Gate of Life, granting longevity and ascent to the Nine Heavens. Why? The Master of Original Yang said: *‘Cold and heat spur each other; male and female complete each other. The left kidney, male, bears the sun; the right kidney, female, bears the moon. The Water King then transforms into a赤子 (Red Child), who becomes a True Person and ascends to the Nine Heavens.’* The Nine Heavens are the Nine Blacks—Green Heaven’s qi governs life."*

The *Scripture* says: *"Swallowing and rinsing the Golden Elixir, consuming the Jade Flower, thus attaining immortality and the demise of the Three Worms. Why? The Golden Elixir and Jade Flower are the mouth’s essences. Within the heart’s stomach-mouth stands a naked infant girl named *Jiè*, standing upright in the stomach passage, opening her mouth to receive the spirit essence, inhaling the Five Qi. When the mouth is filled with inner and outer essences, swallow them fully into the mouth of the Mysterious Maiden. After five repetitions, tap the teeth three times and swallow saliva nine times—thus the Three Worms perish."*

*The Scripture says:*

*"Always remember the Three Chambers are interconnected—
preserve and rinse the Five Teeth to banish hunger and thirst.
Why? The Bright Hall, the Cavern Chamber, and the Elixir Field—
three threes make nine, and nine merge into one.
The Five Teeth are the generative *qi* of the Five Phases.
On the first day of spring at the crowing of the rooster,
enter the chamber facing east, bow nine times, and sit upright.
Tap the teeth nine times, then meditate on the Nine-Thousand-Myriad-People
descending—*Yuan Shi* Old Lord *Jiu Qing* in his Green-Ling *Yuan Shi* glory,
his form shrouded in mist like clouds within the room.
Let him enter through your mouth, descending straight to the liver.
Recite:
*'Nine *qi* of Green Heaven,
Yuan Shi of the Upper Clarity,
Sovereign Old Lord, divine and august,
clad in green robes,
commanding celestial officials,
radiant as the Morning Star,
scattering brilliance, perfuming virtue,
nourishing my form—
I consume the morning dew,
drawing the essence of wood,
thus nourishing the Green Teeth,
securing them in the spirit—
the liver’s palace swells with fullness,
jade sprouts of their own accord,
extending years, preserving youth,
my face like that of a child.
The Five *qi* blend harmoniously,
Heaven and Earth eternally united.'*

When the incantation is complete,
draw the Green *qi* inward nine times and cease.

*The Scripture says:*
*'The clouds of the Five Peaks rise in Peng-Heng splendor,
moistening the Jade Nostril to repay itself.
The Jade Nostril—this is the nose.
The Five Forms remain round and firm, free from calamity.
Why? The *qi* of the Five Peaks is the *qi* of the Five Viscera.
If unobstructed and flowing, the Three Worms perish on their own.
Entering and exiting through the Mysterious Female,
endless and unbroken—
thus, preserving and refining, the Dao is complete.
The Empty Chamber births White,
the Five Viscera grow firm and round—
then sickness cannot take root.

*The Scripture says:*
*'The Five Spirits light the night with eightfold brilliance.
Why? The Five Spirits are the Five Stars,
arrayed across the body.
If always preserved, one becomes one with Heaven and Earth.

*The Scripture says:*
*'Within the square inch, ponder the Deeply Hidden.
Why?'*

The square inch is called the Lower Pass,
located three inches below the navel,
its breadth and depth one inch—
here the Essence is stored.
Square when still, round when moving,
neither motionless nor restless—
only block and seal it, never let it leak.

*The Scripture says:*
*"Within, embrace the sun and moon, the constellations arrayed,
the Seven Luminaries and Nine Celestial Ones crowned at the Gate of Birth.
Why?*

At the hour of *zi* (子),
store the heart in the Western Tai Bai Star,
between the eyebrows, straight inward one inch—
this is the Jade Hall, the Purple Gate,
with the Sun to the left and Moon to the right.

Next, store the Northern Chen Star
in the Imperial Homeland, the Mysterious Palace—
the Mysterious Palace is five *fen* at the hairline,
straight inward one inch.

Next, store the Eastern Sui Star
in the Cavern Gate, the Vermilion Terrace—
the Vermilion Terrace is behind the eyes,
straight inward one inch.

Next, store the Southern Yinghuo Star
in the Jade Gate, the Flowery Square—
the Flowery Square is five *fen* from the outer corner of the eye,
straight inward five *fen*.

Next, store the Central Zhen Star
in the Golden Chamber, the Long Valley—
the Long Valley is at the philtrum,
straight inward two *fen*.

Store them as if suspended above,
knocking the teeth five times,
swallowing saliva five times.

Whisper softly:
*"High and lofty Purple Gate,
within five spirits reside.
Jewelous brilliance spreads its light,
radiant beams burst through the Gate—
Essence-qi accumulates and grows,
transforming into the Old Man,
wearing a headband, white robes, green cloak, crimson skirt,
right sash with jingling bells, left sash with tiger guards,
holding Heaven’s Rigor, scattering crimson stars,
stepping on the Flowery Canopy,
spitting radiance to refine the spirit—
preserve the Three Scenes,
grant me this body,
nurture the soul, subdue the soul-spirit,
ascend on the Phoenix to become immortal."*

Thus, the Seven Luminaries are the Seven Stars,
paired with the seven orifices.
The Nine Heavens are the Nine Celestial Ones,
paired with the nine orifices—
none may be neglected.

*The Scripture says:*
*"When qi is lost and fluids leak, the form is not your own.
Seal within, govern the light—only then comes lasting peace.
Why?*

Close the chamber, refine the qi,
neither spit far nor speak much,
restrain emotions and desires,
store the light of sun and moon.

The Upper Clarity has the method of *Adopting the Flying Root*,
always at dawn facing east, knocking the teeth nine times.

Whisper in the dark:
*"Day-Soul Pearl-Light,
illuminating the Green Jade,
twisting crimson clouds, the Red Boy,
dark flames chanting the Symbol."*

Then, close the eyes and grasp firmly,
store the five colors of flowing clouds,
all entering the mouth—
this is *Adopting the Flying Root of the Sun*.

Thus, facing the sun, swallow the clouds forty-five times,
swallow saliva nine times in succession.

*The Scripture says:*
*"The Five Phases urge each other, returning to One,
three and five combine—qi of the ninefold nodes.
Why?*

The Five Phases generate and conquer in cycles,
their urging returns to One.
One is the number of Water—
the origin of the Five Phases, the root of all things.

Laozi said:
*The Dao gives birth to One,
One gives birth to Two,
Two gives birth to Three,
Three gives birth to all things.*

The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate,
which gives birth to the Two Principles.
The Supreme Ultimate is One—
One is the name of the Primordial.
All things are formed from it,
thus they return to One.

Three refers to the ears, nose, and mouth in man.
Five refers to the Emperor’s Essence.
Thus, three and five combine—
three threes make nine.

Three and five are the roots of Heaven and Earth,
the pivotal convergence of the six directions,
the rhythmic nodes of the Nine Palaces.
The Three Primordial qi,
the mixed Essence of creation,
entering and exiting the Palaces of Upper Clarity and Great Purity—
if one preserves and reflects upon them,
the Dao of longevity is attained.

*The Scripture says:*
*"Ascend swiftly to the Dao of sun and moon above.
Why?"*

There is a method of ingesting the Moon’s essence.
When the moon rises in the west, strike your teeth ten times,
then softly invoke the names of the Five Moon Ladies—
*"Moon Arc, Radiant and Veiled,
Graceful Void, Sacred Orchid,
Luminous Jade, Pure Gold,
Stately and Resplendent"*—
and pray:

*"Moon Arc, resplendent and veiled,
Fragrant and luminous, subtle and clear,
Graceful in the void, sacred orchid,
Lush blossoms clustered like cranes,
Pure gold, clear glow,
Stately bearing, marked by virtue."*

Then close your eyes and clench your fists,
concentrating as the moon’s five-colored radiance
enters your mouth as a unified light.
Within that light, a yellow *qi* appears,
large as a pupil—
this is the *Flying Yellow Moon Essence* within the Jade Embryo.
To cultivate it is to make *Yùyí* chase the sun,
and *Jiélín* chase the moon,
harmonizing voices and seeking matching *qi*.

*The Scripture says:*
*"The Primordial Dao refines the upper and lower soul-spirit,
and in one act, the transformation is complete.
Why?"*

Use One to refine the spirit,
and refine the spirit to merge with One.
One is the name of *wuwei*—
its essence is tranquil and obtained without sight,
guarding the True with full intent, returning to the self.

*The Scripture says:*
*"Condense the pearl, secure the essence, nourish the spirit-root.
Why?"*

The *condensed pearl* refers to saliva rising and falling like beads,
while *securing the essence* means not letting it leak.
The *spirit-root* is the physical form.

*The Scripture says:*
*"Whether seated or rising, we share the rafters,
day and night, shining like the sun, then hidden at dusk.
Circulate the flower-essence to balance yin and yang.
Why?"*

The spirit uses the body as its dwelling—
this is its rafters.
The mind’s focus aligns with the eyes.
The *flower-essence* is the eye-essence.
When the heart opens, the eyes open,
day as sun, night as moon—
thus it balances yin and yang.

*The Scripture says:*
*"Loosen the hair, desireless, to endure eternally,
all five flavors return as pure *qi*.
Why?"*

The *embryonic breathing* method:
lie back, hair unbound, raise the head two inches and two *fen*,
curl both thumbs, clench fists, close eyes,
extend arms five *cùn* from the body,
rinse the mouth fully, swallow saliva three times,
then gently inhale through the nose for five or six breaths,
exhaling.
One inhalation and exhalation is one breath.
After ten exhalations, a groan may emerge;
after groaning, repeat.
Forty-nine breaths complete one cycle—
one cycle is seven days.

*Loosening the hair* means *wuwei*, desireless,
as the spirit condenses and the fluids flow,
the Primordial *qi* enters the viscera,
forming the five flavors, all arriving together.
Unified into One, they become still and clear.

*Exterior Radiance Chapter*

「The jade *yin* and golden *yang* lock within—
to fortify the inner essence.

Alone nourishing the *Tàihé* (Great Harmony) *qi*,
one may attain immortality.

The *Scripture* says:
Above is the Yellow Court, below the *Guānyuán* (Cradle of Primordial *Qi*).
Why is it One?

The Yellow Court lies within the head,
its *Míngtáng* (Bright Hall), *Dòngfáng* (Cavern Chamber), and *Dānyī* (Elixir Field) are thus named.
Two *cùn* behind the eyebrows is the Bright Hall,
two *cùn* further in is the Cavern Chamber,
three *cùn* deeper is the Elixir Field.
These three are the Upper Primordial’s essence—**One**.

The Yellow Court is split into two halves,
forming the Cavern Chamber.
Within its center grows the Red *Yīzi* (Embryonic Breath),
thus becoming **One**.
If one constantly contemplates this without error,
the Red *Yīzi* transforms into the True Person within the Bright Hall.
Hence, the One is within the Bright Hall.

Guiding and directing *qi*,
closing the eyes to gaze inward,
calming the mind and steadying the will—
the chaotic void knows no bounds.
Focus to let one’s refined essence ascend,
flowing to the *Níwán* (Brain of Mud).

Within the Bright Hall are the Sovereign and Minister,
within the Cavern Chamber are Father and Mother,
within the Elixir Field are Husband and Wife.

Some say:
The Yellow Court is the spleen.
Its cultivation lies three *cùn* below the *Zhōngguānyuán* (Middle Cradle),
where the *Yuányáng* (Primordial Yang) Gate is found before it.
The suspended essence shines like a mirror,
illuminating the entire body—
this is the Dao.

The *Scripture* says:
Behind lies the *Yōuyè* (Dark Gate), before the *Mìngmén* (Life Gate).
The Breathing Lodge’s *qi* enters the Elixir Field,
the Jade Pool’s clear waters nourish the Lingering Root.
Why?

The Dark Gate refers to the two kidneys,
shaped like an inverted cup,
three *cùn* below the navel,
small at the top and broad at the bottom,
bearing the Sun and Moon.

The Life Gate lies below the navel.
The Breathing Lodge’s *qi*—
when exhaling, it is *hū* (Breath Out),
when inhaling, it is *xī* (Breath In).
The Lodge is the nose—
the critical passage for expelling the old and drawing in the new.

The eyebrows’ *qi* retreats three *cùn*—
this is the Elixir Palace.
The Jade Pool’s clear waters are the mouth’s saliva.
The Lingering Root is the tongue.
To constantly refine the teeth and rinse the saliva,
one may irrigate the root of the tongue.

The *Scripture* says:
The Three Yang’s exterior origins come from the divine—
the Three Yang grant longevity.
Why?

Eight for men, seven for women—
these are the Three Radiance’s cycles.
Inner cultivation begins here,
aligning with the sun and moon,
preserving the heavens and earth.

The Three Yang’s Embryonic Breath is born,
one divine spirit of *hún* (ethereal soul) and *pò* (corporeal soul) enters the womb,
the nose draws the Yang *qi* inward for nurturing.

The Red *Yīzi*, True Person, and Embryonic Breath—
these are the Three *Yīn*, the so-called One *Yīn* Spirit.

*Hún* is Yang;
*Pò* is *Yīn*.
Those without virtue and power in this world
will see their *hún* and *pò* scatter and depart.

Yet if one restrains the ethereal soul
and governs the corporeal soul,
keeping them from straying,
ever within the body,
then one’s Dao harmonizes with Nature.

The *Scripture* says:
The *Yóuqí* (Wandering Pearl) and suspended *Zhū* (Jewel)
return to their source—
the jade *yin* and golden *yang* lock within,
the body becomes firm and whole.
Why?

The Wandering Pearl revolves and turns,
the *qi* and meridians flow without ceasing.
Closing the mouth to preserve the spirit,
rinse the *Lìquán* (Nectar Spring) like flowing pearls.
*Yīn* is the *yin* (female),
Yang is the *yang* (male);
when neither harms the other,
the mouth attains harmony,
refining essence and transforming form—
thus one attains firmness and wholeness.

The *Scripture* says:
The tortoise mirrors the four seasons,
its essence transforms like the elixir.
Bending forward and backward, each has its own gate—
sending the elixir and *Xuánduàn* (Mysterious Spring) to the tortoise,
drawing *qi* to the Lingering Root.
Why?

The Bright Hall’s four pathways correspond to the four seasons,
where the True Person’s elixir resides.
Chewing its *qi*,
if one contemplates it, then longevity knows no end.

Head and feet,
kidneys and heart—
the heart is red, the kidneys black,
both rooted in the same origin.
Water and fire counterbalance each other,
hence the differing gates.

The elixir is blood.
When transformed into the Lower Primordial,
it becomes white essence.
At this moment, draw in the nose to return it,
ascending to the *Níwán*,
descending to the mouth,
changing into the Jade Spring,
then with the nose draw *qi* to the tongue’s root.
Swallowing and sending it to the abdomen,
a thunderous resonance answers—
this is the True *Qi* acting thus.

The *Scripture* says:
Alone consuming the *Tàihé* (Great Harmony) *Yīn-Yáng Qi*,
thus one may not die—
the celestial correspondence is complete.
Why?

Mortal men consume the earth’s refined essence,
rewarding the earth with death.
The Sage consumes the *Yuánhé* (Primordial Harmony) *Qi*,
rewarding the heavens with transcendence.
Thus, the student of immortality
feasts on Yang *Qi* in the morning,
feasts on *Yīn Qi* in the evening,
and when both are united,
one may not die.

The *Scripture* says:
The Dao sustains my divine spirit,
the luminous light of *hún* and *pò*.
By day, it shines resplendent,
by night, it guards itself.
Thirst yields to nectar,
hunger finds fulfillment.
Why?

Contemplate the heart’s red *Qi*,
illuminating all spirits with clarity.
Guard the light of the sun and moon,
ponder the kidneys’ roots.
By day, guard the light;
by night, guard the spirit.
When hungry, consume Nature’s *Qi*;
when thirsty, drink the *Huápóu* (Flower Pond) nectar—
then one will know no hunger nor thirst,
and attain longevity.

The *Scripture* says:
Pass through the Six Palaces and Five Storehouses,
*zǎo* (morning) and *yǒu* (evening)—
the Yang’s essence is hidden within the Nine.
Why?

The roots grow from the Six Palaces,
hidden within *zǎo* (morning) and *yǒu* (evening).
Their subtleties are profound—
Yang reverses to belong to *Yīn*,
turning to align with its counterpart,
returning to be hidden within the Nine.

The Nine is the head—
this is the saying: *Left Three, Right Seven, Wear Nine and Tread One*.
At the time of *yīngwū* (parrot-like breath),
lie back, hair unbound,
refine the teeth thirty-six times,
swallow essence and gulp *qi*—
this is the path to distance death.

The *Scripture* says:
The liver’s *Qi* is refined and prolonged,
arrayed across the Five Storehouses to generate the Three Radiance.
Above, it unites with the Three *Jiāo* (Burners),
the Dao drinks the Flower Pond nectar.
Why?

Refined *Qi* ascends to the head,
supplementing the *Níwán*.
The Five Palaces and Six Palaces each have their own master,
hence the kidneys’ upper and lower bear the Sun, Moon, and Three Radiance.

The Three Radiance are the Sun, Moon, and stars.
The Three *Jiāo* are the Three Primordial Gates.
The nectar is the Flower Pond.

The *Scripture* says:
My divine spirit, *hún* and *pò*, reside in the center,
essence and fluids flow like springs,
departing from the nose’s fragrance,
standing at the *Xuányīng* (Mysterious Navel),
embracing the Bright Hall.
Why?

The central *hún* and *pò* are the two kidneys,
whose essence and fluids flow like springs,
departing from the nose’s fragrance—
this is the *Xuányīng* (Mysterious Navel),
where one stands to embrace the Bright Hall.»

The left *hún* and right *pò*,
by day the *hún* guards the *pò*,
by dusk the *pò* guards the *hún*—
restraining the *hún*, mastering the *pò*,
so they may not move or act arbitrarily.
When yin and yang merge,
the essence is lost and fluids leak,
then food becomes tasteless and the nose loses its fragrance.

The region beneath the tongue is the *Xuányīng* (Mysterious Navel).
The lungs are the Bright Hall.
If one contains and swallows the *Qi*,
it will irrigate the Bright Hall,
and flow throughout the body.

The *Scripture* says:
*"Nourish my essence and refine my fluids,
balance yin and yang,
and dwell at the Mysterious Gate,
awaiting the Heavenly Dao.*
Why?

This is the practice of storing essence and nurturing spirit—
embracing yin and containing yang,
to regulate one’s spirit and vital essence.

The Mysterious Gate is the nose.
Awaiting the spirit of the upper capital,
to guard the spirit and vital essence
and thereby preserve the body.

The *Scripture* says:
*'Empty and tranquil, without contrivance,
the spirit lingers and remains.
The vital essence ascends and descends,
passing through the Three Primordial Gates to regulate its functions.*
Why?

Within, one refines the Dao to achieve non-action;
without, one refines the Dao to achieve non-desire.
Thus the heart is not troubled or disordered,
and the spirit lingers and remains.

Essence is the spirit;
*Qi* is the Dao.
Preserving essence and conserving *Qi*,
the upper and lower each have their proper functions.
When essence is considered,
contemplate its ascent and descent,
to guard the singular spirit—
this is possible.

The *Scripture* says:
*'Returning past the Flower Pond,
stirring the kidney’s essence,
standing at the Bright Hall,
gazing upon the Elixir Field,
to command all spirits to open the Commanding Gate.*
Why?

It is the path from the brain’s chamber,
descending along the spine,
and entering the kidneys.

The eyebrows mark the return:
one inch inward is the Bright Hall,
three inches inward is the Elixir Field.

The nose is the Heavenly Root;
draw its true *Qi* continuously day and night—
this is possible.

The *Scripture* says:
*'Following the nose’s ascent and descent,
open the two ears,
and with eyes closed,
preserve the Child within
to regulate essence and refine fluids,
thus harmonizing the teeth.*
Why?

The Primordial *Qi* enters and exits through the nose,
ascending and descending to the two ears.

Heaven is the head;
Earth is the lower body.
The Child is the preservation of singular thought,
to guard the spirit.

Inhale the Five *Qi*,
polish the thirty-six teeth,
swallow the saliva thirty-six times,
and this can regulate the Mysterious White.

The *Scripture* says:
*'Nurture the灵 Root,
and it will not wither again.*
Why?

To nourish the tongue’s root
is to prevent its desiccation.
Beneath the tongue lies the *Lìquán* (Sweet Spring),
its flow like pearls,
always contain and swallow it—
do not spit it out recklessly.

The *Scripture* says:
*'Seal the Commanding Gate like the Jade Capital,
and life will extend beyond ten thousand years.
The spirit within the spleen roams the Middle Palace.*
Why?

Human life depends on essence and fluids;
always cherish and nourish them,
do not waste them recklessly,
then the essence congeals like jade,
dwelling in the lower body—
and this can ensure longevity.

The spleen is above the Great Granary,
by day it serves the Lord Lao to govern,
by night it roams the Bright Hall,
as the Lord of Great Unity.
The *Scripture* says:

*'Irrigate the blood vessels,
and sweat becomes nectar.*
Why?

The Five Palaces are in harmony,
and the sweat and fluids of hands and feet
are the signs of divine clarity.

The *Scripture* says:
*'Observe the Heavenly *Qi* above,
and one’s years will increase.*
Why?

To consume the Primordial *Qi*
makes the bones light,
and when *Qi* and spirit harmonize,
one’s lifespan will reach three hundred years.

The *Scripture* says:
*'Ingesting the Mysterious *Qi* can fulfill life,
returning past the Seven Gates,
to drink from the Great Spring.*
Why?

The Mysterious *Qi* is the white *Qi* between the two kidneys.
The Great Spring is the *Lìquán* (Sweet Spring) within the throat.

**神景篇**

The Divine Landscape:
The *Taishan* (Great Mountain) Palace is the *yang* (male),
while the *Qi* lingers in the *yin* (female) chambers.
When their *qi* intermingles in harmony,
the spirit governs them as its chariot.

The *Tiangu* (Heavenly Valley) is the palace of the *Nihuan* (Mud Ball).
Above, it is crimson; below, it is dark and mysterious.
To the left, it is azure; to the right, it is white—
within, there shines a yellow,
the abode of the Primordial Spirit,
the most sacred essence of the True One.
This is our very nature,
while the heart serves as its function.

When the spirit is still, all transformations rest in peace;
when emotions stir, all transformations arise.
He who guards the One,
who guards the spirit—
then the spirit grows still,
and the True One dwells in Heaven.

The Upper *Yin* is the *Tuo* (Detachment).
Before the *Nihuan* lies the *Ziwu* (Purple Forbidden) position,
and before *Ziwu* lies the *Yuqing* (Jade Purity) position.
Below *Yuqing* lies the *Mingtang* (Bright Hall) position,
which descends through the nose.
The nose is the gate of the *yin*.

The Lower *Yin* is the heart.
Above the heart lies the *Yuquan* (Jade Spring) position,
and above *Yuquan* lies the *Taihuang* (Great Sovereign) position.
Above *Taihuang* lies the *Jinguang* (Golden Light) Court position,
and above *Jinguang* lies the *Huiquan* (Wisdom Spring) position.
Above *Huiquan* lies the *Wuling* (Five Spirits) Source position,
and above *Wuling* lies the *Lingquan* (Spirit Spring) position.
Passing *Tianyue* (Heavenly Luminaries),
it exits through the stomach’s mouth,
enters the *Jiudian* (Nine Ends),
and flows through the earth’s vital pathways
until it reaches its mouth and the ears—
the gate of the *yin*.

The spirit is the mother of *qi*,
while *qi* is the child of the spirit—
never to be separated, not for an instant.
When the spirit rests in the *yang* chambers,
the *qi* lingers in the *yin* halls.
Thus, the spirit governs below,
intermingling with *qi* in ascent and descent,
an unceasing flow of Nature’s Way.
Therefore, one must strive with utmost diligence.

To attain stillness within the marvelous,
and within stillness, to find the spirit—
then the Three Garments are complete,
while the Four Organs stand empty.
What are the Three Garments?
They are *nature*, *wisdom*, and *enlightenment*.
What are the Four Organs?
They are the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the tongue.
Nature is the spirit,
wisdom is its penetration,
enlightenment is its transformation.
The sage observes nature to generate the *dharma*—
the *dharma* is boundless.
Thus, transformation extends infinitely,
entering the realm of *wuwei* (non-action).
To act without knowing one acts—
the organs are empty,
the six dusts vanish,
and what need is there of the Six Bandits?
I purify the spirit, untainted by the myriad transformations,
its transcendent power ever-guarded.
How could it weary in use?
How could it grow weary in preservation?

The ordinary mind is empty yet not formless,
formful yet not empty—
the wondrous function of *wuwei*.

The Three Palaces are the ascending and descending heart and spleen.
The Two Gatherings are their pathways.
Above, they connect to the Heavenly Gate,
below, they reach the Earthly Door,
and within, they irrigate the Three Palaces.

The brain is dark above, crimson below,
white on the left, azure on the right—
within, there shines a yellow,
the true essence of the Three *Yin*,
the core of the *Tai Xuan* (Great Mystery).
Its external essence is called *Sao* (Searching),
its watery essence is the *Shengshe* (Remaining Serpent),
its name is the *Magician* of *Taisu* (Great Primordial).
It inhales and exhales true *qi*,
circulating through the meridians.

The lower heart is crimson above, dark below,
azure on the left, white on the right—
within, there shines a yellow,
the true essence of the Three *Yang*,
the core of *Taiyi* (Great One).
Its external essence is called *Mo* (Submergence),
its watery essence is the *Yuangui* (Tortoise),
its name is the *Magician* of *Tai Xuan* (Great Mystery).
It inhales and exhales true *qi*,
circulating through the meridians.

The spleen resides at the center,
as the hall where the Two *Qi* ascend and descend,
where spirit and *qi* intermingle.

If I guard the *Nihuan* and *Tiangu*,
its master governs two thousand seven hundred breaths.
When *qi* settles into ten cycles,
naturally, the heart’s *yang* and the brain’s *yang*
merge with the spleen.
Descending through the *Yucai* (Jade Vault),
passing the *Taicang* (Great Granary),
entering the *Weiwèn* (Tail Gate),
exiting through the heart,
ascending the Two Gatherings—
its form resembles a fire wheel.

The Primordial Spirit passes through *Shangqing* (Upper Purity),
travels through *Taishu* (Great Pivot),
crosses the *Lingdao* (Spirit Path),
enters the *Zhongmiao* (Central Temple),
proceeds through the *Naohu* (Brain Gate),
exits the *Fengfu* (Wind Palace),
transmits through the Two Gatherings—
spirit and *qi* intermingle,
and the hundred limbs,
the five forms,
burn like fire,
their essence surging like a gushing spring.

Thus, in observation,
the spirit does not enter the realm of form.
In vision, the spirit does not enter the realm of sound.
In scent, the spirit does not enter the realm of aroma.
I am serene and steadfast in stillness—
the Four Organs may be said to be empty.

The sage knows that emptiness is not empty,
that form is not form,
and thus attains wisdom here.

To know the unknown—who knows wisdom?
To see the unseen—who knows the marvel?
Thus, the nature beyond nature is called *he* (harmony),
the spirit beyond spirit is called *zhen* (true)—
this is the daily stillness.

He who, within stillness,
discerns the spirit beyond spirit,
the nature beyond nature—
nurtures the spirit and transforms nature,
and thus aligns with Heaven and Earth in duration,
harmonizing with *yin* and *yang* in movement.

**平都篇**
**太上玄丹**

**Chapter on Píngdū**
**The Supreme Daoist’s Mysterious Elixir**

When the subtlest becomes manifest,
The crimson palace with its purple gate—
its method is not distant.

The True Lord of Zhōngyuè, Sū Zǐxián, says:
*"I have obtained the Supreme Daoist’s Mysterious Elixir Scripture.
Between the two eyebrows, retreat upward three inches,
dividing into the Guard of the Twin [Eyebrows] and the Inch-Field [Forehead].

Within, the left side holds the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber,
while the right side holds the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal.
Within the Crimson Terrace, seek the Dao—
guide it left and right to the palaces and gates,
awaiting the extraordinary *qi*.

The spirit of the Purple Portal is named the Peaceful Guardian Sovereign Who Upholds the Law;
the spirit of the Azure Chamber is named the Rectified Heart.
Their forms resemble infants,
clad in robes the color of their chambers,
each holding a golden chime that flows like liquid metal.
At dusk, when resting or meditating,
first invoke the three spirits—
their forms appear indistinctly.

Then strike the teeth,
three times calling their names and praying:
*'Great Gods of the Purple Portal and Azure Chamber,
handling flowing chimes,
your bodies generating wind and clouds,
escorting the True Dao,
come before me—
my thoughts resonate with you,
your spirits swift as pottery,
entering and exiting with precision,
ascending the Nine Gates,
thus revealing the Nine True Sovereigns of the Supreme.*

After the prayer,
meditate on the Three-One, the Nine Passages of the Cavernous Chamber, and all essential pathways.

Within the left and right ears are the Cloud Commands.
The Cloud Commands toll their bells to notify the Nine Officials—
when heard, clasp your hands over your ears
and pray:
*'The Red Sovereign dwells in the Palace,
the Nine True Ones in the Chamber.
Hearken to divine command,
reveal all omens of misfortune—
the Supreme One’s flowing fire
extinguishes all calamity.*

After the prayer,
with your fingers, pass seven times through the ear gates.
If your face grows warm, it is a good sign.
If your neck feels cold and shivering,
evil has entered.

Lie down in darkness, close your eyes,
and focus on the Mysterious Elixir Palace.
The Supreme One True Lord, with his flowing-fire chime,
illuminates and casts it forth,
driving away malevolent *qi*.
Then your ears and eyes—both inner and outer—
burn with radiant fire,
illuminating your entire body.

Retreat inward one inch—
this is the Bright Hall Palace.
Within it,
to the left stands the True Lord of Luminous Youth,
to the right stands the True Lady of Luminous Virtue,
and within them is the Spirit Lord of the Clear Mirror.
These three officials govern water and fire.
They wear green brocade robes,
belted with red jade chimes,
holding red jade mirrors in their mouths.
Their forms resemble infants,
facing outward and emerging.

After invoking them,
three times call their names:
The Luminous Youth is named *Xuányáng*, styled *Shàoqīng*;
the Luminous Virtue is named *Wēiyīn*, styled *Shàoyuán*;
the Clear Mirror is named *Zhàoqīng*, styled *Sìmíng*.
Strike the teeth nine times,
and a thousand demons will be subdued,
a myriad ghosts annihilated.

For hunger and thirst,
invoke the three lords—
your mouth will emit red *qi*,
which you swallow and absorb.
In moments, hunger and thirst will vanish.

For extending life,
fix your heart and lie still in the Bright Hall,
before the three lords.
Face outward, kneel long,
and emit red radiant *qi* from your mouth,
pouring it over your body.
Soon, the red *qi* will encircle you as fire,
merging with your form—
your body and fire become one,
inner and outer luminous.
After some time, it ceases—
this is the Sun-Moon Refining of the Form.

Retreat inward two inches—
this is the Cavernous Chamber Palace.
Within it,
to the left stands the Masterless Prince,
to the right stands the White Sovereign,
and within them is the Yellow Old Lord—
this is the path of the Flying True Ones.

Retreat inward three inches—
this is the Elixir Field Palace.
Within it dwells the True Emperor of the Upper Primordial,
who governs with two ministers,
together guarding the Three Primordials.
This is the True One’s Dao—
the genuine essence of this land.

Retreat inward four inches—
this is the Flowing Pearl Palace,
where the Official of Destiny moves.

Retreat inward five inches—
this is the Jade Emperor’s Palace,
where the Jade Empress resides.

Above the Bright Hall, one inch—
this is the Heavenly Court Palace,
where the Pure Clarity True Maiden resides.

Above the Cavernous Chamber, one inch—
this is the Cavernous Truth Palace,
where the Supreme Ultimate’s Consort resides.

Above the Elixir Field, one square inch—
this is the Mysterious Elixir Palace,
the soul palace of the brain’s essence and the *níwán* [marrow].
The brain is the spirit of the body,
the birthplace of a hundred spirits,
the source of fluids and the origin of essence,
the jade chamber of the soul.
If one can make the *níwán* round and empty,
filling it with the True,
then a thousand pores stand erect,
a myriad holes emit mist—
its virtue encompasses Heaven and Earth,
merging with the Great Square.
Thus it is called *níwán*.
The *níwán* is the supreme spirit of form.
Only those who know to swallow *qi* and absorb fluids,
humming and striking the teeth,
but do not know their source—
these are but the remnants of the *níwán*.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace is one square inch,
with a green chamber and purple microcosmic room.
When filled with crimson essence,
the *níwán*’s Supreme One True Lord resides within.
His form resembles an infant,
seated upon a golden bed beneath a jade canopy,
wearing embroidered purple robes,
his waist belted with flowing light.
In his left hand, he holds the dipper of the Big Dipper,
in his right, the North Star’s presentation.
The North Star is the unmoving star of the North Pole.
*The Supreme Dragon Scripture* says:
*'Sit upright in the Mysterious Elixir,
neither leaning nor askew—
this is the Dao.*

At night, when resting,
set aside all thoughts,
sit or lie as you will.
First, meditate on the North Star’s purple *qi*
entering the Mysterious Elixir Palace.
Soon it overflows outward,
surrounding your body internally and externally,
merging with the purple chamber.

Again, meditate on the sun’s entry into the Mysterious Elixir Palace,
where purple *qi* resides—
it appears like a fire-pearl in darkness.
Then, invoke the Supreme One True Lord of the Central Yellow
descending from the North Star’s purple *qi*
into the Mysterious Elixir Palace.
Afterward, meditate on his sudden ascent
into the Mysterious Elixir Palace,
sitting before the Supreme One.
His robes shift with his will.
Rise, bow twice with your head to the ground,
and kneel, asking questions before him."*

Now swallow the purple *qi* thirty times,
and swallow the saliva thirty times.

Then, meditate on the seven stars of the Big Dipper,
wherewithin there is a crimson *qi* like a bowstring,
descending directly into the Mysterious Elixir Palace.
Thus, the Supreme One and his form together follow the sun’s path,
entering the crimson *qi*’s way,
ascending to the Big Dipper’s handle.

Practice this for fourteen years,
and you shall wander with the Supreme One through the seven primal threads;
for sixteen years,
and you shall receive scriptures from the Upper Clarity.

Evening practice is essential—
count only, do not neglect it.
Those who specialize in this need not observe the Three Ones.*

On the first, third, seventh, and fifteenth days of the month,
as well as at midnight,
meditate on the Supreme One True Lord within the Mysterious Elixir Palace,
sitting upright and facing outward,
exhaling purple *qi* from the mouth,
letting it descend into your own,
and swallowing it fifty times.

Recite softly:
*"Supreme True Emperor, Central Yellow Purple Lord;
Your title is *Guiying*, your name *Huaxuan*;
On golden bed and jade pavilion, in crimson brocade and embroidered robes;
Waist girded with fire-bells, slaying evil and crushing deceit;
Holding stellar essence, crowned with the sun’s true light;
Seated and exhaling *qi*, commanding me to swallow the saliva;
Grant me audience, serve me the Mysterious Elixir;
Refine and nourish the seven spirits, harmonize and soften the three souls;
Divine spirits guard me, let me ascend as an immortal;
The five viscera regenerate, restoring youthful vigor;
Receive scriptures from Upper Clarity, O Lord of Destiny;
All desires fulfilled, a hundred blessings renewed."*

Afterward, meditate on his form ascending into the Mysterious Elixir Palace,
resting before the Supreme One.

What is the Mysterious Elixir?
It is the spirit of the *Nihuan* [Cinnabar Field].

*The Scripture of the Primordial True One* says:
*"Qi congeals into essence, essence gives rise to spirit.
Spirit becomes the True Person, the True Person ascends as the Red Boy—
this is the True One."*

Thus, those who guard the Three Ones are Earthly True Ones,
those who guard the Inner Chamber are True Persons,
and those who guard the Mysterious Elixir are officials of the *Taixuan* [Supreme Mystery].

The method of guarding the One
requires meditating on the seven stars of the Big Dipper,
taking its handle as a canopy,
its shaft pointing forward,
with the Red Boy dwelling within.
When the seven stars rise gradually to my crown,
their feet facing heaven and pointing straight ahead,
meditate on the *Yangming* and *Yinjing* in the rear,
and on the *Tianguan* star, ordering it to align with my mouth—
seven *chi* distant—
so that yellow *qi* and yang essence flow harmoniously in three paths.

Now, each of the seven stars has its attendant boy:
1. The *Yangming* star, named *Shumíng*;
2. The *Yinjing* star, named *Yaoling*;
3. The True Person star, named *Beiyuan*;
4. The *Xuanning* star, named *Baojing*;
5. The *Danyuan* star, named *Danying*;
6. The *Beiji* star, named *Qingqing*;
7. The *Tianwu* star, named *Ziying*.

If you constantly meditate on them above a single star,
a hundred evils will not dare act,
and malevolent *qi* will perish.

*The Inner Vision of the Central Plane* says:
*"To ascend to the Pure and Refined,
meditate on the five stars;
Secrets within secrets, never leaving the courtyard.
The method of meditation is as follows:"*

At midnight when *qi* is born, sit upright on the couch, facing the moon’s position, and strike the teeth nine times to clear them, swallowing saliva thirty times. Bow twice northward. In a solemn invocation, declare:

*"Respectfully I inform the Most High, the True Lord of the Supreme Polarity—
I request the Five Directions, the Five Emperors, and the Five Spirits to gather and manifest."*

After the invocation, close your eyes and visualize the five stars suspended above you:
The **Chen** star of the North rests upon your head,
The **Sui** star of the East at your left,
The **Tai Bai** star of the West at your right,
The **Yinghuo** star of the South between your knees,
The **Zhen** star of the Center within your heart.

Practice this constantly, and in time you will perceive the essence of the stars—
the Five Elders will arrive, and you may question them about the Dao of flying immortals.

**Huang Bo Yan**, named Jing, had a method of refining the form:
*"Visualize the Central Star of the North Pole,
and within its core, imagine the Red Boy of the Sun holding a crimson banner,
brandishing the Fire of Shao Hao to burn your body—
thus refining away the Three Corpses and attaining longevity."*

**Shi Tang** transmitted this method:
*"Constantly focus on a star between your brows,
its light like a bean—
meditate until it glows red as fire,
then suddenly it envelops your face and spreads across your body.
In an instant, you forget your form,
seeing only the fire’s crimson radiance—
after a time, it fades, and your body returns to its original state."*

**Le Zi Chang** had the method of *Xuan Hua Chi*:
*"Hold a date pit in your mouth as a child sucks milk,
until it fills—
swallow three parts, retain two,
and let the saliva descend with the *qi*.
This is called *Returning the Essence*—
it can circulate endlessly."*

Rise and strike the teeth thirty-six times;
when done three hundred times, the loose teeth will firm,
the decayed will heal,
and the aching will cease.

There is also the method of consuming the Five Sprouts:
First, face east and strike the teeth nine times, then invoke:
*"Eastern Green Tooth, Purple Clouds flowing like dewdrops;
Three Pure Ones lingering, Dark Frost and Jade Nets;
Consume the Morning Radiance, swallow the Dawn’s Flowers."*

Afterward, with your tongue against the upper lip’s edge,
collect saliva and swallow thirty times—
lick and swallow each time, visualizing the green *qi* entering your liver.
Practice this for ten years,
and the Eastern Elder will come to teach you the *Scripture of Green Truth*.

Next, face south and strike the teeth nine times, then invoke:
*"Southern Crimson Crow, Vermilion Clouds of Tai Wei;
Nine Paths descending mist, dispelling the Bright Splendor;
Consume the Sacred Dawn, drink from the Crimson Pool."*

Afterward, with your tongue against the lower lip’s edge,
collect saliva and swallow thirty times,
visualizing the red *qi* entering your heart.
Practice this for ten years,
and the Southern Elder will come to teach you the *Scripture of Radiant Elixir*.

Next, face west and strike the teeth nine times, then invoke:
*"Western Upper Brightness, Flying Clouds of Golden Elixir;
Consume the Supreme Brightness, the Pure Spirit’s Essence;
Drink the Jade Wine, the Dawn’s Flowers awakening the Sacred;
Ascend to the Void Emperor, rise to the High Purity."*

Afterward, with your tongue against the inner lip,
collect saliva and swallow thirty times,
visualizing the white *qi* entering your lungs.
Practice this for ten years,
and the Western Elder will come to teach you the *Symbols of Pure Authority and Divine Power*.

Next, face north and strike the teeth nine times, then invoke:
*"Northern Mysterious Nourishment, Clouds crossing to awaken the embryo;
Three Ascents of Green Mist, Purple Canopy and Azure Dawn;
Consume the Sun’s Flowers, drink the Jade Candy."*

Afterward, with your tongue against the inner lower lip,
collect saliva and swallow thirty times,
visualizing the dark *qi* entering your kidneys.
Practice this for ten years,
and the Northern Elder will come to teach you the *Symbols of Mysterious Records and Precious Clarity*.

Finally, sit facing south and strike the teeth nine times, then invoke:
*"The Wu-Ji Essence, Yellow and White Five Clouds,
Four Vermilion Mists of Purple and Azure,
Eight Sceneries and Nine Dawns,
Two Bright Ones stirring the Splendor,
Seven Celestial Luminaries of Sacred Venerability—
Blend the saliva to nourish the *qi*,
Consume the Central Essence,
Luminous Flowers nurturing the embryo,
Drink from the Nectar Spring."*

Afterward, rinse your mouth fully—
between the upper and lower teeth, the tongue and gums—
swallow the saliva forty times,
visualizing the yellow *qi* entering your spleen.
Practice this for ten years,
and the Central Yellow Elder will come to teach you:
*The Yellow Qi and Yang Essence,
The Hidden Heaven and Concealed Moon,
The Green Chapter and Azure Talisman,
The Waist-Tiger’s Scriptures.*

These five methods may all be combined to ascend.

If you ascend with the Mysterious and the Four Elders together,
the Four Polar Elders will descend simultaneously and ascend with you—
they do not depart one by one.
Yet even if practiced separately, it need not be done in strict stillness;
a tranquil mind and relaxed body suffice.

**Chapter on Refining the Essence:**

Rise and chew the jade spring within;
Repel external harm, secure the Three Fields.

**Sun Zhēnren** said:
*"At dawn, before speaking, chew the jade spring slowly and swallow it twice seven times,
then strike the teeth fourteen times.
With prolonged practice, the essence will fill,
moistening your entire body.
Hair should always be combed,
teeth always struck,
saliva always swallowed,
*qi* always purified,
hands often held to the face,
feet frequently moved,
ears regularly massaged,
eyes often rubbed.
At the hour of the Tiger, perform *Dao Yin* exercises—
strike the teeth thirty-six times to gather your spirit,
visualize the colors and forms of the Five Viscera in the *Dan Tian*,
and circulate them once.
Then still your breath for two inhalations,
sever all thoughts,
and keep your mind constantly in the Lower *Dan Tian*—
whether standing, sitting, or lying down—
always thus focused.
In time, the spirit and *qi* will settle,
and no ailments will arise.

But resentment, anger, sorrow, fear, vexation,
and lustful desires—
these are the greatest taboos for the True One.
Even a single disturbance will deplete the Original *Qi*.
This is called Inner Elixir."*

「Bestow kindness upon others in secrecy,
this is called the Outer Elixir.

In the *Pure Yang* Chapter,
the Cauldron of *Tai Yi* follows the model of *You* (酉).
Breathing a hundred *ke* (刻),
this is called the *Divine Talisman* (神符).

The Yellow Emperor wandered in the wilds of *Qingcheng* (青城),
where he encountered *Guangchengzi* (广成子),
*Qibo* (岐伯), and *Huangguzi* (黄谷子),
and inquired of them.
Thus, he obtained the *Divine Talisman* of a hundred *ke*.

The *Pure Yang* Master said:
*The ke* begins at one,
yet my breath encompasses a hundred and twenty-five *ke*.
At the hours of *Zi* (子), *Wu* (午), *Mao* (卯), and *You* (酉),
the *ke* number is nine and eight in excess—
when it reaches fullness, a hundredfold,
my breath is fixed at one.

Through day and night,
my breath totals thirteen thousand five hundred *ke*.
Circulating throughout the body,
thus the *meridians* and *blood vessels* flow in fifty cycles,
and the Inner Elixir is born.

The hour *Mao* (卯) is called *You* (酉),
for it represents the division of two—
how could it be unclear?

The fire of mid-spring,
the *Great Yang* (太阳),
is called the Fire Taboo (*huǒ jì* 火忌).
Thus, I observe the principles of advance and retreat,
with the Dragon following the Tiger,
and the *Divine Talisman* is attained.

Indeed, I use the *Jue* (兑) metal as my *Ze* (泽),
water born of metal,
metal born of earth,
forming the Cauldron of *Tai Yi*—
this is what is called the *You* model.

I am now advancing the fire,
three thousand days until the *Zhu Lin* (珠琳) is complete.
*Jia* (甲), the gallbladder—*Zi* (子), *Xu* (戌), *Shen* (申), *Wu* (午), *Chen* (辰), *Yin* (寅);
*Yi* (乙), the liver—*Wei* (未), *Mao* (卯), *You* (酉), *Si* (巳), *Hai* (亥), *Chou* (丑);
*Bing* (丙), the small intestine—*Zi* (子), *Shen* (申), *Wu* (午), *Yin* (寅), *Chen* (辰), *Xu* (戌);
*Ding* (丁), the heart—*Chou* (丑), *Mao* (卯), *Si* (巳), *Wei* (未), *You* (酉), *Hai* (亥);
*Wu* (戊), the stomach—*Zi* (子), *Yin* (寅), *Chen* (辰), *Wu* (午), *Shen* (申), *Xu* (戌);
*Ji* (己), the spleen—*Chou* (丑), *Mao* (卯), *Si* (巳), *You* (酉), *Wei* (未), *Hai* (亥);
*Geng* (庚), the large intestine—*Zi* (子), *Chen* (辰), *Yin* (寅), *Xu* (戌), *Wu* (午), *Shen* (申);
*Xin* (辛), the lungs—*You* (酉), *Mao* (卯), *Si* (巳), *Chou* (丑), *Hai* (亥), *Wei* (未);
*Ren* (壬), the bladder—*Zi* (子), *Yin* (寅), *Chen* (辰), *Wu* (午), *Shen* (申), *Xu* (戌);
*Gui* (癸), the kidneys—*Chou* (丑), *Mao* (卯), *Si* (巳), *Wei* (未), *You* (酉), *Hai* (亥).
This is what is called *Pure Yang*.

Without heaven and earth,
ten thousand things would not be born.
I have obtained it as the method of life and transformation.
*Ren* (壬) is the *Heavenly Mechanism* (天机),
*Bing* (丙) is the *Earthly Knot* (地纽).
By returning to the *Six Jia* (六甲),
I complete the *Way* of heaven and earth’s five phases—
this is the *Great Dao*.

The ancient cauldrons were five:
The largest held water two *sheng* (升),
its height five and a half *cun* (寸),
its name *Dan Sha* (丹砂),
aligned with the *Original Qi* of heaven and earth;
One held water one *dou* (斗),
its height one *chi* (尺),
its name *Qiu Shi* (秋石),
aligned with the *Ten Heavenly Stems* (十干),
all changing every nine days;
One held water one *dou* six *sheng*,
its height one *chi* six *cun*,
its name *Bai Ma* (白马),
aligned with the numbers of sun and moon,
changing daily;
One held water two *dou* eight *sheng*,
its height two *chi* eight *cun*,
its name *Bai Xue* (白雪),
aligned with the *Twenty-Eight Constellations* (二十有八宿),
changing every fifteen days;
One held water two *dou* four *sheng*,
its height two *chi* four *cun*,
its name *Huang Ya* (黄芽),
aligned with the *Twenty-Four Seasons* (二十有四气),
also changing daily.

Now the cauldrons have the *double-nine Yang numbers* (九九阳数).
The essence of the cauldron is *gold* and *mercury*, *Dan Sha* (丹砂).
Its largest holds five *sheng*,
its form changes every five days,
completing a cycle in nine days.

**Volume 10 of Dao Shu (Collected by Ziyouzi Zengmi):**

The pivot of the sun and moon,
The mechanism of Heaven and Earth.
The *Hua yang* text was inscribed,
Taking its master as the model.

*Hua yangzi* said:
*"I possess the method of returning old age to youth.
When inner elixir is refined, true qi arises.
When outer elixir is completed, mortal bones grow strong."*

*Chunyangzi* said:
*"At dawn, swallow the foul saliva to open the stomach,
Exhale heart-qi to massage the face.
For heart-qi—
When it ascends, it becomes complexion;
When it scatters, it becomes pulse;
When it flows, it becomes blood;
When it congeals, it becomes marrow.*

Next, apply thick saliva to the wrist-residence,
Internalize true qi—
The face will naturally glow with ease.

To nourish the lower *yuan*,
Extract the essence of the Dragon and Tiger,
Congeal it in the Yellow Court to form inner elixir.
Inner elixir—
This is what grants longevity.

Refine metals and minerals to supplement the *dantian*,
This is the inner great medicine.
The great medicine—
This is what grants immortality."

*Chunyangzi* said:
*"Rub the abdomen below the navel with both hands,
Completing the *double-nine* count.
Then, with left and right hands alternately encircling the outer kidneys,
Use the number nine.

At mealtime, swallow qi while massaging the outer kidneys,
Draw bladder-qi into the *dantian*,
Send heart-qi downward.
Heart-fire must always descend,
Silently illuminating like the rotation of a fire wheel.
Though its verification may be slow,
Its efficacy is great.

Thus it is said:
The kidneys are the sea of qi;
The heart is the capital of spirit.
Guard them without loss,
Rub, encircle, massage, and swallow.
With both hands embracing the navel,
When exhausted, bend the knees outward.
With the outer kidneys facing the navel,
The lower *yuan* naturally solidifies,
And the inner elixir coalesces.

When uniting *Kan* and *Li*,
Take the *mao-you* hours as appropriate;
When uniting Dragon and Tiger,
Take the *zi-wu* hours as appropriate.
The ancient sages nourished the Yang without nourishing the Yin,
Refined the Dragon without refining the Tiger—
Who can fathom their profundity?

Using *mao* to unite with *Kan-Li*,
Close the breath and sit still,
Allowing qi and fluids to converge inward,
Nourishing the five viscera internally,
Filling the four limbs externally.

Using *wu* to unite with the Tiger,
Fill the mouth with saliva,
Allow lead to merge with mercury,
Let *dansha* congeal and solidify,
Harvest and supplement the returned elixir.

Qi arises from the kidneys,
Return qi to the kidneys—this is called *Small Return Elixir*;
Spirit arises from the heart,
Return spirit to the heart—this is called *Middle Return Elixir*;
Marrow arises from the brain,
Return marrow to the brain—this is called *Great Return Elixir*.

The union of Dragon and Tiger is *Small Return*;
Inner observation is *Middle Return*;
The *Zhouhou* method is *Great Return*.

*Chunyangzi* said:
*"Kill the husband, save the wife—
Seek their mother."*

«Examine the five phases’ cycle of generation and conquest,
Follow the four seasons’ waxing and waning—
This may be called the ultimate refinement.

Though killing the husband and seeking the mother
Can only rescue and supplement the deficiencies of the five viscera,
And summoning the child to expel the ghost
Can only drain the excess of one’s own organ—

Whenever the organ’s essence is deficient,
One must seek the mother and exhort it,
So that the *qi* returns to the *tian* (field),
And the child-mother mutually generate,
Thus refining and transforming the form.

What is the *Taiyin* (Great Yin) method of refining the form?
By drawing water from the throat to irrigate the four limbs—
This is the *Yuyeli* (Jade Fluid) method of refining the form.

What is the *Taisun* (Great Yang) method of refining the form?
By governing *qi* within the *dantian* (elixir field),
And burning it throughout the hundred bones—
This is the *Jinye* (Golden Fluid) method of refining the form.

Refining Yin with Yang yields slow results,
Refining Yang with Yin yields subtle effects.

At the time when *qi* reigns supreme at noon,
Sit still and elevate the body,
Exhale through the nose without limit in its length—
When the *qi* is full, let perspiration emerge slightly,
This is called the *Zhenzhu Yu* (True Pearl Bath).

After noon, when the *qi* is weak,
Lie down and circulate the *qi* between the hands and feet without stagnation,
And when the *qi* is full, draw it back into the *danyuan* (elixir origin),
Repeatedly gathering it without limit in its quantity—
Frequent swallowing and frequent pounding are the marvelous techniques when entering the *danyuan*.

If, after the *Small Return Elixir*, the residual *qi* descends to supplement the brain,
Or if, after the *Return Elixir*, the residual *qi* ascends to burn the body,
These methods are not applicable at that time.

Gold and stone may be extracted for external elixir,
Yet borrowed *qi* will never truly belong to one’s own body;
The *Kanli* (Water-Fire) method may be adopted for internal elixir,
Yet empty *qi* will never sustain constant use.

In the past, some refined true Yin and true Yang
To congeal into internal elixir,
And within the *qi* further extracted true *qi* to return to the *Huangting* (Yellow Court).

When practicing this, one must seize the moment
When the five *qi* converge at noon,
Paying close attention to gather it—
This is how the *Hechiji Dan* (Scarlet Vermilion Elixir) forms in a single day,
And within a decade, one achieves the goal of seizing three hundred years of life.

At the juncture of *Chen* and *Wei* (3 AM–9 AM),
Gather the essence of the liver—
This is called the *Qingjin Dan* (Blue-Green Elixir);
At the juncture of *Wu* and *Shen* (1 PM–5 PM),
Gather the essence of the heart—
This is called the *Hongye Dan* (Red Fluid Elixir);
At the juncture of *Zi* and *Wu* (11 PM–7 AM),
Gather the essence of the spleen—
This is called the *Huangya Dan* (Yellow Sprout Elixir);
At the juncture of *Xu* and *Hai* (7 PM–3 AM),
Gather the essence of the lungs—
This is called the *Xihua Dan* (Western Splendor Elixir);
At the juncture of *Chou* and *Yin* (9 PM–1 AM),
Gather the essence of the kidneys—
This is called the *Tawei Dan* (Great Minute Elixir).

Whenever one elixir is refined and gathered,
It suffices to extend one’s lifespan to a hundred years.
Refining and gathering the five elixirs
Is the method for prolonged vision and longevity.

Extract true *qi* to refine *qi*,
And thus within *qi* there arises *qi*—
This *qi* generates spirit,
And where spirit abides, form abides as well.

Refine true *qi* according to the great cycle,
Refine elemental *qi* according to the small cycle—
This is indeed a method for longevity and extending years.
Yet it is still not as good as
Refining the five *qi* in a single day,
And forming the great elixir in ten days—
By extinguishing thoughts to guard true breath,
And retaining *qi* to nourish the elemental spirit—
First within the five viscera,
Then within the remaining six palaces,
Where *qi* generates spirit,
And refining spirit unites with the Dao.

The principles of the *Zhou Tian* (Circulation of the Heavens) fire stages
Are not singular.

By closing the breath to attack illness,
By pressing the sides and abdomen to supplement decline,
By elevating the body to unblock the meridians,
By pressing the hips to strengthen the waist and knees—
What is valued is that the timing must be precise,
Advancing and withdrawing must be measured,
Adding or reducing fire must be appropriate,
And draining or supplementing must be well-timed.

A skilled elixir refiner
Depends on the *sanmei* (threefold) breath
And follows the *Zhou Tian* circulation—
Every five days, a breath cycle is completed,
Then proceed to the next stage—
Accumulating a hundred breaths is called *Small Achievement*,
A thousand breaths is called *Middle Achievement*,
And ten thousand breaths is called *Great Achievement*.

Before noon, refine the form
By frequently elevating and drawing the *qi*—
This is not to be exhausted;
After noon, refine the elixir
By frequently swallowing and drinking the *qi*—
This is the marvelous technique.

Why does one add or reduce fire?
At the start, use *Qian* (Heaven),
Then *Dui* (Joy),
And finally *Kun* (Earth);
At the start, refine with *Lian* (Refinement),
Then with *Liang* (Nourishment),
And finally with *Jin* (Severance)—
These are all the principles of fire progression.

What is *inner observation*?
It means observing oneself, not external objects,
Observing the inner, not the outer.

I have a method of observing the heart—
When not a single thought arises,
It is like holding a bowl of water,
Ever serene and constantly clear.

I have a method of observing the heavens—
All day long, sit in stillness,
Silently facing the Supreme Dao.

I have a method of observing the nose—
Always as if a thread hangs from it,
Ascending then re-entering,
Descending then ascending again.

When *inner observation* reaches its peak,
The *qi* enters the *niniwan* (brain marrow),
And the spirit transcends the *Neiyuan* (Inner Court).

Those *Shamen* (Buddhist monks) who enter prolonged meditation
Eventually fall into confusion and torpor,
Only achieving the emergence of the Yin spirit from its shell.

The Daoist who lingers in *zuowang* (forgetting sitting)
Becomes dull and attached—
How can spirit and *qi* ever be perfected?

Thus, the method of *inner observation*
Must take extinguishing the heart as its foundation,
And severing thoughts as its application—
Lowering the heart’s fire into the *dantian*,
Without calculating the stages of progress—
It is like Bodhidharma’s saying:
*"Not a single thought escapes—
The mind naturally settles internally,
And the elemental spirit congeals."*

The *qi*-bearing breath is easy to practice but difficult to perfect—
Why?
Because of the presence of deluded perceptions of the heart.

The true *qi*-bearing breath is difficult to practice but easy to perfect—
Why?
Because of the presence of a naturally tranquil nature.

The technique of *qi*-bearing breath:
Close the breath that enters,
Retain the breath that is transmitted—
Soft and continuous, as if it exists naturally,
And its application need not be frequent.

Thus, there is the method of *Chao Yuan* (Ascending to the Origin):
At the time of *Zi* (11 PM), *qi* is generated,
And by *Wu* (7 AM), it ascends to the heart;
At the time of *Wu* (7 AM), fluids are generated,
And by *Zi* (11 PM), they descend back to the kidneys.

When the Dragon and Tiger unite to form the elixir,
This is called *Descending Chao Yuan*.

By separating lead and mercury within the *qi*-bearing breath,
And thus forming the spirit,
The three Yangs ascend into the *Neiyuan* (Inner Court)—
This is called *Ascending Chao Yuan*.

When refining *qi*, the *qi* reveals its true nature,
When refining spirit, the spirit enters the *Yuan Palace* (Origin Palace).
By dispersing the Yin demons with true fire,
The elixir forms and the *qi* naturally ascends—
When the *qi* is true, the spirit naturally ascends.

Before noon, sit in stillness,
And through the nose, draw the *qi* long and deep—
It will naturally converge with the *Zhongyuan* (Central Origin).»

Before the hour of *Zi* (11 PM), sit in stillness,
Retract the body and swallow the *qi*—
It will naturally ascend to the *Xiaoyuan* (Lower Origin).

Before sunrise, sit in stillness,
Raise the body and arch the back—
The *qi* will naturally ascend to the *Shangyuan* (Upper Origin).

Why is this called *Returning Essence to Nourish the Brain*?
For essence resides in the kidneys—
If supplemented by *qi*, one may attain longevity.
*Qi* resides in the heart—
If calmed by spirit, one may attain immortality.
Marrow issues from the brain—
If supplemented by true Yin and true Yang, one may reverse aging and return to youth.

To draw the kidney’s *qi* from behind the elbow
And send it flying into the Upper Palace—
This is supplementing with true Yin.

To return the true *qi* inward and observe within,
Ascending to the Inner Palace—
This is supplementing with true Yang.

To remain silent all day, forgetting concerns and severing schemes,
As Yin and Yang *qi* intermingle and congeal in the *Suihai* (Marrow Sea)—
This is supplementing both Yin and Yang.

The method for supplementing true Yin
Does not exceed the time between *Chou* (1–3 AM) and *Yin* (3–5 AM).
Raise the body, straighten the waist, and arch the chest,
Close the *Double Pass* and move within.
The young may open it monthly,
The old may open it every hundred days.
Open the *Double Pass* and then close the *Upper Pass*—
Open as before, and once entered into the Upper Palace, it is *Ji Ji* (Completion).

What is *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* (Uncompleted)?
When *Kan* (Water) and *Li* (Fire) align,
They nourish the five viscera but cannot yet form the elixir.
When Dragon and Tiger interact,
They gather the five *qi* but cannot yet ascend to *Chao Yuan*.
Only when the elixir forms in *Wei Ji*
And the spirit converges with pure Yang can it be achieved.

The Pure Yang Sage becomes a long-lived immortal dwelling in the mortal realm—
This is the work of *Kan* and *Li* interacting.
To become a Pure Yang High True One who abandons the shell and ascends—
This is the work of Dragon and Tiger uniting.

The interaction of *Kan* and *Li* occurs in the *Li* hexagram.
It is the drawing of saliva and inhaling *qi*.
Taking Yang from within Yin,
Taking Yin from within Yang—
This alone suffices for longevity and immortality.

When the elixir is complete that very day,
Pure Yang *qi* arises—
It is no longer like the kidney *qi* containing the Yin Tiger.
When the marrow is full that very day,
Pure Yang water descends—
It is no longer like the heart fluid containing the Yang Dragon.

Upper water, lower fire—
This is the meaning of *Ji Ji*.
Thus, without the true water in the cauldron,
One cannot regulate the Pure Yang *qi*;
Without the true fire in the elixir,
One cannot refine the Pure Yang essence.

Rising and descending alternately,
Using Yang to refine Yin until Yin is exhausted and Pure Yang remains.
Thus, the Yang spirit naturally gathers,
Ascending to the Heavenly Palace, ready to abandon the shell.

The method of *Ji Ji* involves,
Before noon, practicing the *Fenshen* (Dividing the Form) method within the *Fenshen* posture,
And applying the *Huan Dan* (Returning the Elixir) swallowing technique.

What is the method of *Dividing the Form*?
Sometimes, by hanging a thread from the nose,
Making the *qi* ascend into the Heavenly Palace.
Sometimes, by summoning earthly forms to rise,
Causing the spirit to depart its original position—
Both can achieve *Dividing the Form*.

Or, like a crane leaving its nest to pierce the Heavenly Gate,
Or a dragon emerging from water to enter the *Biluo* (Celestial Realm),
Or through the Three-Story Red Mansion,
Or the Seven-Layer Jewel Tower,
Or the Flower Village,
Or the Withered Tree—
All can lead to abandoning the shell.

This is called the method of *Adjusting the Spirit and Ascending as an Immortal*, is it not?

For humanity’s origin lies in the parents’ essence and blood,
Which forms the kidneys.
The kidneys are the elixir.
The true elixir is the Yin and Yang of our body.
When the elixir forms, true *qi* arises.
When true *qi* is sufficient, only then can transformation begin.
Ascending to refine the form leads to soaring flight,
Retaining to refine the *qi* leads to abandoning the shell.

If one lacks inner elixir and only relies on the kidney *qi*’s ascent and inhalation to seek *Dividing the Form*,
One may only achieve the Yin spirit mistakenly exiting the Heavenly Gate—
This is the path of the Ghost Immortal.

Preserving and guarding the kidney *qi*,
Extracting the essence of Yin and Yang,
Congealing it into elixir—
When the elixir forms and *qi* is sufficient,
Refining *qi* according to the method will cause the Original *qi* to ascend and the true spirit to gather.

Adjusting the spirit according to the method,
The spirit naturally forms its body—
Why seek further the method of *Adjusting the Spirit* or the likeness of *Dividing the Form*?
Students err by not establishing their foundation
And yet seek the secret of *Dividing the Form*.
Even if they can exit the Heavenly Gate,
Their comings and goings are unrefined,
Their departures and returns flawed—
The dim true spirit cannot re-enter the body.
This is their fault, and it is truly pitiful!

**Observing the Heavenly Chapter**
The Original *qi* of the Dao is its foundation;
Water and fire interact, Yin and Yang circulate.

The *Chongxu* Sage expounds upon the *Taishang*’s teachings:
The *Chongxu* Sage annotates:
The Original *qi* takes the Dao as its foundation,
Its essence lies in the movement of water and fire.

What are water and fire?
They are the *qi* and fluids of heart and kidneys, mutually generating.
Thus, refine their Yin and Yang—
What are Yin and Yang?
They are the sun-soul and moon-shadow,
Ensuring their harmony without exceeding measure.

Metal and wood restraining each other,
Through restraint, instruments are formed.
The Dragon is Yang, born of *Li* (Fire),
The Tiger is Yin, born of *Kan* (Water)—
These are called the Yellow Sprouts!

The Daoist practitioner has three realms:
The first is the *Head of the Heavenly Realm*—
This is the *Shangyuan* (Upper Origin).
The *Tiangu* (Heavenly Valley) of the *Nihuan* (Brain’s Cavity),
Where ten thousand spirits gather,
Where thirty-six thousand spirits pass through—
This is the path of ascending and descending,
Of guiding the spirit into the brain.

The *Dazui* (Great Hammer) bone is the Heavenly Realm’s pass,
The route of ascending and descending, of coming and going in cycles—
A single strike can reach the Heavenly Pass.
Ascending from below is the *Jiaofu* (Joint Support) pass,
Within which lies the medicine—
This is the Yellow Sprout, the White Snow!

The heart is the *Jiangong* (Vermilion Palace).
When the heart is at ease, the spirit is at ease;
When the heart is disturbed, the spirit is disturbed—
All spirits take their measure from it.
Its form is the Vermilion Phoenix,
Its name is the Red Dragon—
It belongs to the fire of the South.

Using the heart’s fluid to refine the lung’s *qi*
Yields the Golden Paste.

The Vermilion Palace’s rear holds the **Tai Xuan** Pass and the Blood Viscera’s Treasury—why so?

From the heart arises **True Water**.
**True Water** is the **Mysterious** (*Xuan*).

Three inches below the navel lies the **Great Sea**,
Its name is the **Great Sea**, within which dwell the **Tortoise and Serpent**,
Hiding the **Original Qi**.

Those who cultivate life know how to breathe—
This is the foundation of nourishing the **True**!

The left is the **Kidney** (*Shen*), the right is **Life** (*Ming*).
Embrace and guard the **Original Qi**,
Refine and temper **Nature and Fate**,
Polish the **Yin** to make it **Yang**—
Thus one may find peace and prolong life.

Within the **Kidney** dwells a spirit.
Before enlightenment, it is called the **Chaste Maiden**;
When perfected, it is called the **Original Sovereign** (*Yuan Jun*).
Before refinement, it is the **Original Tortoise**;
When refined, it is the **White Deer**—
With two heads and four feet!

The **Great Sea** holds a **Treasure Bottle**,
Within which the **True Essence** is stored—
Called the **Nine Returns, Seven Transformations, Immortal Elixir**.
Behind it lies the **Tail Question Pass**,
Within which are two orifices connecting to the **Shu Lu** Pass.

Ascending from the **Tail Pass** is the first movement;
Passing the **Tai Xuan** is the second;
Passing the **Shu Lu**—
Thus, a single strike opens both passes.

The left is **Cultural Qi** (*Wen Qi*), the right is **Martial Qi** (*Wu Qi*).
They ascend to the **Heavenly Realm**—
The left holds the **Azure Dragon**, the right the **White Tiger**—
These are the two **Qi**.

In the world, people between the **Child** and **Horse** hours
Gargle and swallow their **saliva from the Flower Pool**—
Yet the three passes remain unopened,
So they merely inhale into emptiness,
Swallow water into the hollow intestines—
How can they reach the **Extreme Yang’s Head**,
The **Níhuán Palace**,
And achieve transformation?

Only when **Child** hour follows and **Yang** first arises
Must one set the furnace’s fire below,
Gather the **Yang Spirit** in the inner courtyard,
Seize the **Dragon and Tiger** in the **Bottle**—
This is the marvel of refining essence,
Driving away ghosts and spirits.

With each inhalation and exhalation,
**Qi** travels three inches.
Calculating one breath,
Day and night it moves **12,500 times** through the body.

When breath and movement are steady,
The **Dragon and Tiger embryo** may form.

The *Laozi* says:
*"Know its mother, then know its child;
Know its child, then guard its mother.
Child and mother cling together,
Guarding the **Bright Hall**—
Thus the inner **Divine Infant** is unbroken."*

The **Bright Hall** is the **Níhuán**.
The **Child and Mother** are the roots of **Yin and Yang**.

What then is the key?
Nourish the **Yang Spirit**,
Refine the **Yin Soul** (*Pò*),
Turn **Essence into Qi**,
**Qi into Spirit**,
**Spirit into the Dao**—
When the work is complete and the path fulfilled,
This is the way of **eternal life and longevity**.

---

**Observing the Five Voids**

Movement yet unobstructed,
Stagnation yet unblocked—
Examine their extremes,
To observe the **Five Voids**.

**Xi Yi Master** says:
*"To fathom the Void’s lack of Void,
Nothing surpasses **Spirit and Wisdom**—
This is the path of the **Great Void**."*

Thus there are **Five Voids**:

The first is the **Dull Void**.
Why?
Empty yet untransformed,
Stagnant yet unpassing,
Yin-heavy and turbid,
Clear **Qi** buried and unaroused,
Yang weak and crude—
This is the ultimate fool.

The second is the **Nature Void**.
Why?
Empty yet unyielding,
Still yet clear—
Only the **emptiness within the *Li* (Fire)** is embraced,
Yet unaware of the **fullness within the *Kǎn* (Water)**.
Bearing all marvels,
Guarding the **lonely Yin**,
It becomes a ghost of **dark obscurity**—
This is the **one with truncated insight**.

The third is the **Law Void**.
Why?
Moving yet unobstructed,
Still yet generative—
Massive yet unforced,
In the **Potential Dragon’s *Kǎn* position**,
Initially communicating with the **Mysterious Valley**,
Within the **formless and colorless**—
Doing nothing,
Yet doing nothing—
In harmony with the **Heavenly Dao**—
This is the **beginning of attaining the Dao**.

The fourth is the **True Void**.

Why?
Knowing color yet not clinging to color,
Knowing emptiness yet not fixating on emptiness—
Thus, the **True Void** transforms and gives birth to the **True Dao**,
The **True Dao** transforms and gives birth to the **True Spirit**,
The **True Spirit** transforms and all things are complete—
This is the **Immortal Sage**.

The fifth is the **Non-Void**.
Why?
Heaven is high and pure, yet it has the sun, moon, and stars;
Earth is still and tranquil, yet it has mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees;
Humans are empty and insubstantial, yet they become Immortals.
The three arise from emptiness and then take form.
One spirit transforms into myriad forms,
One *qi* harmonizes into the Nine *qi*—
Thus, movement rests upon stillness as its foundation,
Existence depends on non-existence as its root—
This is the **Lofty Dragon’s Return**, the highest of the True Ones.

**Chapter on Great Clarity**
The Five Phases and Four Symbols are the essentials of Dao cultivation.
He who knows them may thereby observe the marvels.
The Dao cultivator must clearly understand the Five Phases and Four Symbols.

The Four Symbols are:
1. **Jīn Wēng** (金翁),
2. **Chà Nǚ** (诧女),
3. **Yīng’ér** (婴儿),
4. **Huáng Pó** (黄婆).
Only then will one know the principles of Yin-Yang ascent-descent and the operation of the Seven Treasures.

The Five Phases are the Five Viscera.
The liver is Wood, its stem-branches are *Jia* and *Yǐ*,
Within it is *qi*, named the **Azure Dragon**,
Its path is along the left side of the spinal column,
Above the network of vessels, flowing into the eyes,
Its transformation yields **appearance**.

*Sè* is the residual *qi* of True Water,
Flowing into the left upper palate—
This is called **Jīn Yè** (金液, Golden Fluid).

The lungs are Metal, their stem-branches are *Gēng* and *Xīn*,
Within it is *qi*, named the **White Tiger**,
Its path is along the right side of the spinal column,
Entering the nostrils, its transformation yields **nasal mucus**.
*Nasal mucus* is the residual *qi* of True Metal,
Flowing into the right upper palate—
This is called **Huán Dān** (还丹, Elixir).

The heart is Fire, its stem-branches are *Bǐng* and *Dīng*,
Within it is *qi*, named the **Vermilion Bird**,
Its path is along the heart’s network of vessels,
Entering beneath the tongue, its transformation yields **saliva**.
*Saliva*, when swallowed, enters the heart and transforms into **blood**.
*Blood* is the residual *qi* of True Fire,
Flowing into the left side of the tongue—
This is called **Shén Shuǐ** (神水, Spirit Water).

The kidneys are Water, their stem-branches are *Rén* and *Guǐ*,
Within it is *qi*, named the **Dark Warrior**,
Its path is along the right anterior network of vessels,
Entering the ears, flowing to the right side of the tongue—
This is called **Huá Chí** (华池, Flowering Pool).

The spleen is Earth, its stem-branches are *Wù* and *Sì*,
Within it is *qi*, named the **Victorious Serpent**,
Its path is along the posterior network of vessels,
Circulating into the *Ní Wán* (泥丸, Mud Pillow),
Its transformation yields **ptyalin**.
*Ptyalin* is the residual *qi* of True Earth,
Flowing beneath the lips—
This is called **Huáng Yá** (黄芽, Yellow Sprout).

**Chapter on the Golden Elixir**
Nurture the *qi* and refine the form;

「Calm the mind and sever all thoughts,
Thus the **True Essence** returns.

The Sage of **Zhōu** (茆君, *Mào Jūn*) says:
To perform the work, nothing precedes the cultivation of **qi**;
Once **qi** is cultivated, then retain the **Essence** to refine the form,
And the **True Essence** shall return, uniting with the **One Qi** (一兀气, *Yī Wù qì*).

I have often dwelled in stillness,
Calming the mind and severing all thoughts,
Not stifling the heart while breathing in harmony.

Then I practiced **dǎoyǐn** (导引, *guided movements*),
To make the four limbs flexible and open,
Taking **True Water** (真水, *Zhēn Shuǐ*) to nourish within the **Ding** (鼎, *Crucible*).

Next, I opened the **Jiā Jǐ** (夹脊, *Intertwined Spine*)—twenty-four **guān** (关, *passages/locks*)—
Using **inner** and **outer fire** (内外之火, *Nèi Wài zhī Huǒ*) to ignite the **Three Passages** (三关, *Sān Guān*),
This is the **vital junction** of **Essence** and **qi**.

Sitting for a long while, **qi** accumulates and the **fire carriage** (火车, *Huǒ Chē*) turns;
Three turns, and the **Golden Essence** (金精, *Jīn Jīng*) arises.
The count completes at **nine**,
Then with **water** and **fire**, descending to the **Dān Tián** (丹田, *Elixir Field*), its name has nine:
The **Water and Fire** are already **crossed** (既济, *Jì Jì*),
**Kàn** and **Lí** (坎离, *Kǎn/Lí*) are in **exchange**,
The **husband and wife** (夫妇, *Fū Fù*) are **mutually invested**,
The **sun and moon** (日月, *Rì Yuè*) are **conjoined**,
**Gān** and **Kūn** (乾坤, *Qián/Kūn*) are in **chaotic unity**,
**Jīn** and **Mù** (金木, *Jīn/Mù*) are in **mutual punishment**,
The **Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎, *Lóng/Hǔ*) are in **assembly**,
**Lead and Mercury** (铅汞, *Qiān/Gǒng*) are **harmonized**,
**Yīn** and **Yáng** (阴阳, *Yīn/Yáng*) are **paired**.

When practiced, the **qi** flows freely,
The body feels as if bathed,
And its form becomes **radiant and luminous**.

Thus, the **fire carriage**’s revolutions reach **eighty-one**,
And the count is complete.

In general, after the **child hour** (子时, *Zǐ Shí*),
There is **flaming fire** beneath the navel,
And **lingering illnesses** are dispelled;
Even **hair-like ailments** cannot afflict.

I tested the **stages of this practice**:
On the **first day**, the mind is **turbulent and vexed**;
On the **second day**, the **stomach qi** (谷气, *Gǔ qì*) churns within the abdomen, producing **sound**;
On the **third day**, the **Essence** is **disturbed**, and **qi** sometimes escapes;
On the **fourth day**, the **spirit-qi** (神气, *Shén qì*) is **turbulent**, and **dullness** ensues;
On the **fifth day**, the **True Fire** (真火, *Zhēn Huǒ*) presses the **Three Corpses** (三尸, *Sān Shī*), and the **creatures** depart;
On the **sixth day**, heat arises beneath the navel—**True Fire** has reached the **Elixir Field**, and the **two fires** unite;
On the **seventh day**, the **two flanks** (二胁, *Èr Xiē*) **resonate**, and **True qi** circulates throughout the abdomen;
On the **eighth day**, **water** and **fire** **intertwine**, and the **Elixir Field** and navel **constantly move**;
On the **ninth day**, the **back and spine** (背脊, *Bèi Jǐ*) grow **hot**, the **joints** **yearn to open**, and **True qi** gradually ascends to the **brain**, completing **two cycles** (二九, *Èr Jiǔ*)—**True Fire** revolves to the **Upper Elixir Field** (上丹田, *Shàng Dān Tián*), and sometimes **substances descend**.

They resemble **sparrow eggs** (雀卵, *Què Luǎn*),
Best refined and **swallowed** (吞纳, *Tūnà*).

At **three cycles** (三九, *Sān Jiǔ*), the **kidney chamber** (肾堂, *Shèn Táng*) opens to the **joints**, and **qi** **boils** in the **brain**,
Like **water’s chill**—
Then the **fire carriage** **reverses**, circulating endlessly without pause,
Refining like **snow** while the **Crucible**’s summit **freezes**, its coldness **shivering**.

At **four cycles** (四九, *Sì Jiǔ*), the **spirit-qi** is **clear**,
And the **nose’s** inhalation and exhalation are **unobstructed**.

At **five cycles** (五九, *Wǔ Jiǔ*), the count reaches **forty-five**,
And the **spirit-substance** (神物, *Shén Wù*) appears;
At **six cycles** (六九, *Liù Jiǔ*), the **Flowering Pool**’s **water** is **abundant**,
Irrigating the **hundred vessels** (百脉, *Bǎi Mài*) without **drying** them;
At **seven cycles** (七九, *Qī Jiǔ*), the **joints** **resonate** and **open in silence**,
Permeating the **body**—
Sitting in a **secluded chamber** (密室, *Mì Shì*), the **flesh feels damp** as if **encountering wind**,
And the **qi** within the body **naturally enters**;

At **eight cycles** (八九, *Bā Jiǔ*), the **body is light and nimble**,
And the **Essence** **does not leak**—
**Qi** **naturally revolves**, dwelling in the **center**,
This is called the **rotation of the Dharma Wheel** (法轮, *Fǎ Lún*).

Thus, **eighty-one cycles** (九九八十有一, *Jiǔ Jiǔ Bā Shí Yī*), the **qi** and **vessels** are **open and unobstructed**,
The **nails turn scarlet and fresh**,
The **Absolute Yin** (绝阴, *Jué Yīn*) is **dispelled**,
And the **hands and feet** **perspire constantly**,
While the **complexion changes**.

In general, **eight stages** (凡八者, *Fán Bā Zhě*), if practiced without **cessation**,
And **one hundred days** (至於百日, *Zhì yú Bǎi Rì*) of **sustained circulation** (少通运, *Shǎo Tōng Yùn*) are achieved,
Then **True Mercury** and **True Lead** (真汞真铅, *Zhēn Gǒng Zhēn Qiān*) are **born**—
If **sexual activity** (房色, *Fáng Sè*) is **encountered**, there will be **abdominal distension** (膨腹之疾, *Péng Fù zhī Jí*).
Thus, **lustful desires** (色心, *Sè Xīn*) must not be **indulged**,
And **evening drinking** (暮夜饮酒, *Mù Yè Yǐn Jiǔ*) is **forbidden** while practicing.

**The Tenth Scroll of *Dào Shū* (道枢) concludes.**
**The Eleventh Scroll of *Dào Shū* begins.**

**The *Ní Jīn Piān* (泥金篇) by Master Zēng Kāo of the Wandering Scholar’s School**

When **Kàn** and **Lí** intermingle,
**Gold** and **Water** merge in **Mystic Unity**—
**Yellow Sprout** and **White Tiger**,
**Nine years** bring **fulfillment**.

Those who seek **self-cultivation** must first **discern the Four Symbols** and **Five Phases**,
Then **master the methods of alchemical refinement**—
**Reducing fire to three hundred eighty-four *chǐ* per *jīn***,
**Nine years** bring **fulfillment**—
This is the **Supreme Dao**.

**Yellow Sprout** is the **essence of Lead**;
**White Tiger** emerges from **Mercury’s union**, returning to **True Unity**.
Lead, when joined with Mercury, **transcends from Nonexistence to Existence**—
Mercury, when joined with Lead, **transcends from Existence to Nonexistence**.

**Transforming the Four Symbols** without losing the **Five Phases**,
**Internal Kàn and external Lí**, **Metal and Wood** in harmony,
**Numbers pressing upon hexagrams and lines**, **Sun and Moon marking the hour**,
**Chaos mingles with Harmony**, **Heaven and Earth unite**, and the **Three Realms** are complete.

From **Zǐ (Child)** to **Wǔ (Horse)**,
**Cultivate the Water-Fire cycle**,
**Suppressing and restraining** for **six *zhōu* and six *jiǎzǐ***,
The **Seven Returns** are thus fulfilled.

The **Scripture** says:
*"Lead is the Sovereign, Mercury the Minister.*
*If Lead is untrue, Mercury will not unite with it—*
*If Lead is true, the Minister will not stray."*

**Green Waist Messenger**, **Red and White Generals**,
**Gold unites the two lineages**—
**Diverse clans, yet one family.**

**White Tiger** is the **Root**,
**Yellow Sprout** the **Foundation**—
**Refine Lead into powder**,
**Transform Mercury into dust.**

**Yin dwells within Yang**, **Yang circulates through Yin**,
**Sun waxes, Moon wanes**, **Cold and Heat divide**.
Only **my method** endures with the **Dao**.

Thus, **sixteen *liǎng* of Gold Elixir** can **achieve True Transformation**.

**Harvest the Yellow Sprout**, **sift and wash it**,
**Decant and nurture it**—
Its name is **Gold Sand**, the **Gold Essence**.

Then take **five *liǎng* of Mercury and White Sand**,
**Forming a structured array in the Hua Pool**,
**Placing it in the Divine Furnace** to **solidify and aid**—
**Nurture with fire for five days**, maintaining **five *liǎng* of flame**,
**Drawing the elixir to one *jīn***,
**Entering the Divine Chamber** to **cultivate it**,
**Nine Circulations in the Three Fields**—
Thus, the **Elixir is complete**.

**Cultivators**, at **Winter Solstice (Zǐ)**, first **bathe**,
Enter the **Quiet Chamber**, **burn incense**, and **sit cross-legged**,
**Close the eyes**, **quiet the mind**,
**Tap the teeth thirty-six times**, **drum the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times**,
Then **visualize**:

To the **left, the Azure Dragon**,
To the **right, the White Tiger**,
Before, the **Vermilion Bird**,
Behind, the **Dark Tortoise**.

Then, with the **tongue**, **rinse and swallow the Jade Fluid thirty-six times**,
**Continuously, without pause**.

Afterward, **focus the mind on the Lower Dantian**,
**Gather the spiritual *qi* into one**—
This is called **Water-Fire Intercourse**,
**Mother-Father Guarding Each Other**—
**Ensure no breath escapes through nose or mouth**,
**As in *Chán* meditation**, this is **the supreme method**.

From **dawn to noon**, thus it is done.
From **Zǐ to Wǔ**, in **rest, sleep, or activity**, only **hold the mind in the Lower Field**,
**Guarding the *qi* in unity**.

By the **sixth day of the fourth month**, when **Yang is fully born**, the **spirit does not scatter**;
By the **sixth day of the tenth month**, when **Yin is fully born**, the **year completes its cycle**, and the *qi* **forms**.
A **pearl** congeals in the **Lower Field**, the size of a **quail’s egg**, ever **moving and turning**.

**Nine years**—the *qi* is full, the form **round**, its **light fills the chamber**.
**Eighteen years**—**teeth turn black**, **new teeth grow**, **cold and heat no longer harm**.

**Eighty-one years**—the **viscera and orifices are empty and vast**,
The **pearl of *qi* rises from the Lower Field to above the spleen**,
Like **Sun and Moon converging**, **swallow and descend it**—
**Naturally sated and full**, the **pearl then detaches from the Lower Field**,
Rising to **form the Yellow Sprout**.

**One hundred eighty years**—the **pearl ascends to the Brain of Mud**,
**Circulating at the crown**, its **base ever floating**—
This is the **sign of Ascension**,
**Naturally emitting five-colored *qi***, **transforming into five-colored clouds**,
**Hovering beneath the feet**, **rising into the sky**,
Entering the **Kōngdōng Celestial Realm**,
Sitting upon the **Retreating Bone Terrace**,
**Closing the eyes, quieting the mind**,
The **Mystic Pearl descends from the crown**,
**Transforming into a body**, **effortlessly at ease**—
This is the **True Person**.

**Zǐ** is the **Black Tortoise**.
**Geng, Chǒu to Gèn**—these are the **days the Sun emerges** in the **fifth month**;
**Yín**—the **fourth and sixth months**;
**Jǐa**—the **third and seventh months**;
**Mǎo**—the **second and eighth months**;
**Yǐ**—the **first and ninth months**;
**Chén**—the **tenth and twelfth months**;
**Xùn**—the **eleventh month**.

**Sì, Wèi to Kūn**—these are the **days the Sun sets** in the **eleventh month**;
**Shēn**—the **tenth and twelfth months**;
**Gēng**—the **first and ninth months**;
**Yǒu**—the **second and eighth months**;
**Rén**—the **third and seventh months**;
**Xū**—the **fourth and sixth months**;
**Qián**—the **fifth month**.

**Hài, Rén**—these are the **days of the Moon**—
**This method of Sun and Moon must be known.**

Those who seek **self-cultivation** must, at the hour of **Chǒu**,
**Sit cross-legged**, first **tap the teeth**, then **drum the Heavenly Drum**—
Each **thirty-six times**—
Then, with **both hands**, **lift beneath the navel nine times**—
This is called **Three Lines**.

With **shoulders**, **twist left and right nine times**—
This is called **Returning to the Mountain**.

With **both hands**, **embrace and dance left and right nine times**—
This is called **Dancing with Jade**.

With the **head**, **turn left and right to the *Jīngshèng* nine times**—
This is called **Tiger’s Gaze at Gold Essence**.

With the **head**, **nod forward eighteen times**—
This is called **Six Lines**.

**Ascending to the Dan Palace**, with the **head**, **strike shoulders left and right nine times**—
This is called **Dragging and Shaking Gold Essence**.

**Sit with legs crossed**, **visualizing water rising from the soles**,
**Entering the *Jīngshèng***, **piercing the Azure Palace**,
**Ascending to the Brain of Mud**, **passing the Front Hall of Light**,
**Descending through Lung, Liver, Heart, Kidney, and Spleen**—
Thus, **eighty-one times**,
**Practiced for nine years**—
The **Dao is fulfilled**.

This is the **method of exchanging bones for immortals**, the **prescription for prolonging life for the refined**—

On **Jia-Yi days** (木, Wood),
**Stare fixedly**,
**Cultivate the Liver’s *qi*** nine times,
and **swallow** thirty-six times.
This is called **Cultivating the Green Dragon’s *qi***.

On **Geng-Xin days** (金, Metal),
**Cultivate the Heart’s *qi*** nine times,
**Crossing hands behind the neck**,
and **swallow** eighty-one times.
This is called **Cultivating the Vermilion Bird’s *qi***.

On **Bing-Ding days** (火, Fire),
**Cultivate the Lungs’ *qi*** nine times,
**Lifting hands upward** twenty-seven times,
and **swallow** seventy-two times.
This is called **Cultivating the White Tiger’s *qi***.

On **Ren-Gui days** (水, Water),
**Cross hands over the knees**,
**Cultivate the Kidneys’ *qi*** thirty-six times,
and **swallow** one hundred and eight times.
This is called **Cultivating the Dark Tortoise’s *qi***.

On **Wu-Ji days** (土, Earth),
**Cultivate the Spleen’s *qi*** fifteen times,
**Pressing lips to swallow**,
and **swallow** twenty-three times.
This is called **Cultivating the Soaring Serpent’s *qi***.

The **Liver** belongs to the **Wood phase** of Jia-Yi,
thus its *qi* is named **Green Dragon**.
Its *qi* ascends from the **back spine**, **piercing the left meridian**,
and **enters the *Shénmén*** (神门).
The **Green Dragon’s *qi*** is the **Liver’s *qi***.
The **Green Dragon’s *qi*** enters the **eyes**,
where it **transforms into *mì*** (汨),
the **true Wood**.
The **residual *qi*** of *mì* flows into the **upper left gum**,
where it is **as small as a millet grain**—
this is called **Returning Elixir**.

The **Lungs** belong to the **Metal phase** of Geng-Xin,
thus its *qi* is named **White Tiger**.
Its *qi* ascends from the **back spine**, **piercing the right meridian**,
and **enters the *Xuánmén*** (玄门).
The **White Tiger’s *qi*** is the **Lung’s *qi***.
The **White Tiger’s *qi*** enters the **nose**,
where it **transforms into *tì*** (涕),
the **true Metal**.
The **residual *qi*** of *tì* flows into the **upper right gum**,
where it is **as small as a millet grain**—
this is called **Metal Essence**.

The **Heart** belongs to the **Fire phase** of Bing-Ding,
thus its *qi* is named **Vermilion Bird**.
Its *qi* ascends from the **front abdomen**, **along the left meridian**,
and **reaches the *Tiěniú*** (铁牛).
The **Vermilion Bird’s *qi*** is the **Heart’s *qi***.
The **Vermilion Bird’s *qi*** enters the **tongue**,
where it **transforms into blood**,
the **true Fire**.
The **residual *qi*** of blood flows into the **left side beneath the tongue**—
this is called **Divine Water**.

The **Kidneys** belong to the **Water phase** of Ren-Gui,
thus its *qi* is named **Dark Tortoise**.
Its *qi* ascends from the **front abdomen**, **along the left meridian**,
and **reaches the *Bōrěchuán*** (般若船).
The **Dark Tortoise’s *qi*** is the **Kidney’s *qi***.
The **Dark Tortoise’s *qi*** enters the **ears**,
where it **transforms into *jīng*** (精),
the **true Water**.
The **residual *qi*** of *jīng* flows into the **right side beneath the tongue**—
this is called **Flowering Pool**.

The **Spleen** belongs to the **Earth phase** of Wu-Ji,
thus its *qi* is named **Soaring Serpent**.
Its *qi* ascends from the **back spine**, **piercing both meridians**,
and **reaches the *Níhúan*** (泥丸).
The **Soaring Serpent’s *qi*** is the **Spleen’s *qi***.
The **Soaring Serpent’s *qi*** enters the **brain**,
where it **transforms into *xián*** (涎),
the **true Earth**.
The **residual *qi*** of *xián* flows into the **upper and lower lips**—
this is called **Yellow Sprout**.

What are the **Four Symbols**?
The **Metal Elder** is **saliva** (唾);
The **Yellow Matron** is **spittle** (涎);
The **Infant** is **essence** (精);
The **Amazed Maiden** is **blood** (血).

A **person’s day and night** consist of **twelve hours**,
sometimes with longer nights and shorter days,
sometimes with longer days and shorter nights.
Each hour contains **eight *kè*** (刻),
each *kè* has **sixty *fēn*** (分),
so the **twelve hours** total **ninety-six *kè***,
with **Gān-Kūn** (乾坤) and **Gèn-Sùn** (艮巽) accounting for **four *kè*** and twenty *fēn*.
Four times six is twenty-four,
so **two hundred and forty-eight *fēn***,
this is the **unified hundred *kè*** (百刻).

**Each breath**—its **inhalation and exhalation**—
is **three inches long**,
thus one breath is **one *xī*** (息),
one *xī* is **one *zhū*** (铢) of Fire.
Twenty-four breaths are **one *liǎng*** (两) of Fire,
three hundred and eighty-four breaths are **one *jīn*** (斤) of Fire,
and **thirteen thousand five hundred breaths** are **true Fire**:
thirty-five *jīn*, two *liǎng*, twelve *zhū*.
The *qi* of **one hour** is **six thousand seven hundred and fifty inches long**,
and **twelve hours** make it **eighty-one thousand inches long**.

Within the **hundred *kè*** of day and night,
**fix the *Èrbā*** (二八) **Gate**,
**Refine the Great Elixir** with Seven Materials,
thus forming **Seven Treasures**—
this is the **scheme of *Bāyīn Bāyáng*** (八阴八阳).

**Zǐ** (子) is **eight *kè*** of **Yang**—
the **Black Tortoise**;
**Chǒu** (丑) is **eight *kè*** of **Yin**;
**Gěn** (艮) is **one *kè*** of **Yang**;
**Yín** (寅) is **eight *kè*** of **Yang**;
**Mǎo** (卯) is **eight *kè*** of **Yin**—
the **Green Dragon**;
**Chén** (辰) is **eight *kè*** of **Yang**;
**Sùn** (巽) is **one *kè*** of **Yin**;
**Wèi** (巳) is **eight *kè*** of **Yin**;
**Wǔ** (午) is **eight *kè*** of **Yang**—
the **Crimson Phoenix**;
**Wèi** (未) is **eight *kè*** of **Yin**;
**Kūn** (坤) is **one *kè*** of **Yin**;
**Shēn** (申) is **eight *kè*** of **Yang**;
**Yǒu** (酉) is **eight *kè*** of **Yin**—
the **White Crane**;
**Xū** (戌) is **eight *kè*** of **Yang**;
**Qián** (乾) is **one *kè*** of **Yang**;
**Hài** (亥) is **eight *kè*** of **Yin**.

The *Laozi* says:
**"Cultivating the body** begins by **nourishing the spirit**,
**Nourishing the spirit** begins by **nourishing the *qi***,
**Nourishing the *qi*** begins by **nourishing the brain**,
**Nourishing the brain** begins by **nourishing the Spleen**,
**Nourishing the Spleen** begins by **nourishing the essence**,
**Nourishing the essence** begins by **nourishing the saliva**,
**Nourishing the saliva** begins by **nourishing the water**."

**Water** is the **Fluid of the Flowering Pool**,
the **refined essence of the Original *Qi*** (元气).
**Water** resides in the **Lungs**,
where it **transforms into saliva** (唾),
**white in color**, symbolizing **Metal**,
constantly **consumed by the Heart’s meridian**.

Thus, its **saliva flows into the Heart** and **transforms into blood**,
**red in color**, symbolizing **Fire**,
constantly **controlled by the Kidney’s meridian**.

Thus, its **blood flows into the Kidneys** and **transforms into essence**,
**black in color**, symbolizing **Water**,
constantly **influenced by the Spleen’s meridian**.

Thus, its **essence flows into the Spleen** and **transforms into spittle** (涎),
**yellow in color**, symbolizing **Earth**,
constantly **controlled by the Liver’s meridian**.

Thus, its **spittle flows into the eyes** and **transforms into *mì*** (汨),
**green in color**, symbolizing **Wood**.

The **brain** has **two meridians** descending to the **back spine**,
**reaching the *Qìhǎi*** (气海) **one inch and three *fēn*** below the navel.
The **Sea** is where **spirit, *qi*, and essence** are **concentrated**.

Thus, it is said:
**"Water nourishes all things**,
but **when water is exhausted**, all things **wither**."

**Original *Qi*** (元气) that has not yet **circulated freely**,
cannot **fully explore its subtle functions**.
**Original *Qi*** is the **life essence** of a person.
Its **nature** belongs to the **Spleen**,
the **Spleen** emanates from the **will** (意),
and **will** arises—**the Heart cannot hold it back**.

When one **aligns with the True Way**, one **realizes the nature of awareness**.

What are the **True Five Phases** refined in the furnace?
**Earth**—the White Tiger;
**Heaven**—the Red Phoenix, the Yellow Mother, the Black Tortoise;
**Wind**—the Azure Dragon;
**Mountain**—[itself].

What are the **True Five Phases of the Eight Trigrams**?
**Earth**—the White Primordial;
**Heaven**—the Red Dragon, the Central Palace, the Tortoise Entering the Sea;
**Xùn**—the Azure Serpent;
**Mountain**—[itself].

What are the **Eight Trigrams of the True Five Phases** entering the crucible?
**Kūn (Earth)**—the Small Intestine, the Lungs, the Large Intestine;
**Qián (Heaven)**—the Heart;
**Gèn (Mountain)**—the Kidneys;
**Xùn (Wind)**—the Liver, the Gallbladder, the Bladder.

The **body** is the **empty dwelling of spirit and *qi***;
*Qi* is the **father of spirit**;
Spirit is the **mother of *qi***.
When **spirit and *qi*** are **preserved**, longevity follows;
When **refined to the Original Root**, sainthood is achieved.

Those who **cultivate the body** must **grasp the Five Phases** and **understand the Eight Trigrams**.

I use **three hundred eighty-four *liǎng* of True Fire**, within to correspond to the numbers of the trigrams and lines.

Now, the Eight Trigrams arise from the Liver:
The Liver, **shaking (Zhèn)**, becomes **thunder**;
The Gallbladder, **Xùn**, becomes **wind**;
The Heart, **Lì**, becomes **fire**;
The Small Intestine, **Kūn**, becomes **earth**;
The Lungs, **Duì**, become **marsh**;
The Large Intestine, **Qián**, becomes **heaven**;
The Kidneys, **Kàn**, become **water**;
The Bladder, **Gèn**, becomes **mountain**.

Thus, the Liver **generates seven children** in the **Mao (Zhèn) Azure Dragon** position:
The Gallbladder **constantly**, the Heart **prosperous**, the Small Intestine **prepared**, the Lungs **returning**, the Large Intestine **great strength**, the Kidneys **dissolving**, the Bladder **slight excess**.

Thus, the Gallbladder **generates seven children** in the **Wèi (Xùn) Wind** position:
The Heart **family**, the Small Intestine **observing**, the Lungs **inner trust**, the Large Intestine **small accumulation**, the Kidneys **dispersing**, the Bladder **gradual**, the Liver **benefit**.

Thus, the Heart **generates seven children** in the **Wǔ (Lì) Vermilion Bird** position:
The Small Intestine **advancing**, the Lungs **contrary**, the Large Intestine **great abundance**, the Kidneys **unfinished**, the Bladder **traveling**, the Liver **biting**, the Gallbladder **the cauldron**.

Thus, the Small Intestine **generates seven children** in the **Kūn (Earth)** position:
The Lungs **approaching**, the Large Intestine **peace**, the Kidneys **teacher**, the Bladder **modest**, the Liver **repeating**, the Gallbladder **ascending**, the Heart **bright darkness**.

Thus, the Lungs **generate seven children** in the **Yǒu (Duì) White Tiger** position:
The Large Intestine **centered**, the Kidneys **restrained**, the Bladder **harmony**, the Liver **following**, the Gallbladder **great excess**, the Heart **transforming**, the Small Intestine **gathering**.

Thus, the Large Intestine **generates seven children** in the **Qián (Heaven)** position:
The Kidneys **litigation**, the Bladder **pursuing**, the Liver **no deception**, the Gallbladder **encountering**, the Heart **harmonious**, the Small Intestine **blocked**, the Lungs **treading**.

Thus, the Kidneys **generate seven children** in the **Kàn (Water) True Warrior** position:
The Bladder **contesting**, the Liver **beginning**, the Gallbladder **well**, the Heart **already accomplished**, the Small Intestine **comparing**, the Lungs **restraint**, the Large Intestine **waiting**.

Thus, the Bladder **generates seven children** in the **Gèn (Mountain)** position:
The Liver **nourishing**, the Gallbladder **entangled**, the Heart **abundant**, the Small Intestine **peeling**, the Lungs **damaged**, the Large Intestine **great accumulation**, the Kidneys **enveloped**.

These **Eight Trigrams within**, each with seven children,
The **sixty-four hexagrams**, each with seven children,
Form **seven husbands and seven wives**—
This is the **sevenfold return**, named the **Seven Treasures**.

The **Seven Treasures** are:
*Qi*, blood, essence, **saliva**, **fluids**, **tears**, **spittle**.

Refined with **three hundred eighty-four *liǎng* of True Fire**,
In **nine years**, success is achieved.

I possess the **diagram of the True Five Phases entering the crucible**.

**Qián, Kūn, Gèn, Xùn**—the **four corners**.
**North** is **Kàn**, the Black Tortoise, belonging to **Hài, Zǐ, Chǒu**.
The hexagrams of **Hài** are **Kàn, Zhèn, Kūn, Duì**;
The hexagrams of **Zǐ** are **Jiē, Huī, Xiǎo Chú, Fù**;
The hexagrams of **Chǒu** are **Dà Chú, Jiě, Dǐng, Lín**.

**East** is **Zhèn**, the Azure Dragon, belonging to **Yín, Mǎo, Chén**.
The hexagrams of **Yín** are **Dà Yǒu, Jì Jiē, Cháng, Guǐ, Tóng Rén, Xián, Jiàn, Tài, Tài**;
The hexagrams of **Mǎo** are **Jìn, Gé, Kuí, Dà Guò, Wú Wàng, Sòng, Dà Zhuàng, Xiǎo Guò**.

To the **right, Water**; to the **left, Wind**—
For **Gèn and Xùn** dwell in their corners.

**South** is **Lì**, the Red Phoenix, belonging to **Wèi, Wǔ, Wèi**.
The hexagrams of **Wèi** are **Qián, Gèn, Xùn, Lì**;
The hexagrams of **Wǔ** are **Gòu, Yù, Lǚ, Kùn**;
The hexagrams of **Wèi** are **Guàng, Tú, Jiā Rén, Gé**.

**West** is **Duì**, the White Tiger, belonging to **Shēn, Yǒu, Xū**.
The hexagrams of **Shēn** are **Pǐ, Shī, Sǔn, Suí, Yì, Wèi Jì, Guī Mèi**;
The hexagrams of **Yǒu** are **Míng Yī, Xū, Yǐ, Méng, Sài, Shēng**;
The hexagrams of **Xū** are **Guān, Zhōng Fú, Bō, Fēng, Shì Kè, Qiān**.

To the **right, Earth**; to the **left, Heaven**—
For **Qián and Kūn** dwell in their corners.

**Sitting in a quiet chamber**, **holding fast**, **striking the teeth thirty-six times**,
When **saliva first emerges**, take **nine large steps**, swallow **eighteen to twenty-eight mouthfuls** of the **glossy** kind through the **Heavenly Gate**.
When the **moon rises**, do likewise—
This can **seize the creative mechanism of Heaven and Earth**,
**Assisting the Golden Elixir**, **drawing upon spirit and *qi***.

**The Golden Purity Chapter**:
The **supreme mystery of the Dao** is none other than **Primordial Oneness**.
**Sealing its gate** determines the **abode of life and death**.

**Emperor Purple Yang of the Vermilion Phoenix** says:
**Original *Qi*** encompasses the **thirteen orifices**.
The **mouth** is the **gate and threshold** of the **viscera**;
The **tongue** is the **barrier and lock** of the **viscera**.
The **three pass gates** are the **city of entry and exit**,
The **six palaces** are the **doors of departure and return**!

**Excessive five flavors** weary the teeth and **dry the mouth**,
**Grind the throat** and **consumes the stomach**,
**Dull the intestines** and **agitate the heart**—
Thus, **blocking Duì and closing the pass** to **guard the center** is **proper**.

**The Golden Purity Chapter (continued)**:

The **nose** is the **window and aperture**—
When the **window and aperture** are serene, **spirit and thought** are at ease,
And **spirit and thought** at ease bring **clarity and stillness**;
Thus, **harmonizing the hundred pass gates** brings **eternal life**.

The **heart** has **nine functions**,
To **drive the nine orifices**.
The **sage** attains **longevity and tranquil purpose**,
By **preserving the heart**.

The **large intestine** is **one zhang** with **two chi**,
The **abode of Primordial *Qi***.
When **food fills it**, it **stands upright**,
When **food empties**, it **leans askew**—
**Thickened**, it **resists illness**,
**Thinned**, it **wastes the form**.
Thus, the **sage** seeks to **thicken the abdomen**,
For when the **abdomen is thickened without residue**, **death does not come**.
What does **thickening the abdomen** mean?
It means **abandoning the five flavors**.

The **small intestine** is **eight chi**,
The **source of body fluids**.
It **connects with the hundred pass gates**.
Hence, the **large intestine** is the **cavern**,
The **small intestine** is the **orifice**—
**Sealing the cavern and closing the orifice** brings **eternal life**.

The **heart’s *Qi*** reaches the **kidneys** and **unites with the ears**,
Thus, **excessive listening** wearies the **heart**,
And **closing the ears** brings **tranquil purpose**.

The **lungs** are the **abode of body fluids**.
The **five viscera**—if **followed**, bring **well-being**,
If **contradicted**, bring **illness**,
If **dried**, bring **heat**,
If **moistened**, bring **coldness**.

**Food and drink** are received by the **spleen**,
**Digestion and assimilation** by the **stomach**—
Thus, the **spleen** receives **yang *Qi*** and **shakes leftward**,
The **stomach** receives **yin *Qi*** and **moves rightward**.
When the **stomach is closed**, **death comes**,
When the **spleen’s shaking reaches its limit**, the **soul is lost**.
Ah! The **five viscera** depend on the **spleen**,
And **life and death** depend on the **stomach**.
The **stomach’s tranquility** lies in **abandoning the five flavors**.
The **five viscera’s well-being** comes from **spirit**,
Their **agitation** from **qi**.
When **qi is full**, **spirit is tranquil**.
**Spirit’s tranquility** is the **Dao of eternal life**.
The **Dao knows no greater mystery** than **Primordial Oneness**.
**Primordial Oneness** is **Primordial *Qi***—
It is the **gate and threshold of life and death**,
The **barrier and lock** of **sealing and opening**.

**Pò** is **yin**, **hún** is **yang**—
When **awake**, one **commands the *hún***,
When **asleep**, one **commands the *pò***—
Thus, the **true person** does not **dream**,
For they **preserve the *hún*** and **quiet the *pò***.
**Not to lose** means **preserving the *hún***,
**Not to think** means **quieting the *pò***.
Thus, **true *qi*** remains **constant** and **death does not come**.

To **tranquilize the body**, one **tranquilizes the heart**,
For if the **heart is not tranquil**, the **true essence** is **lost**.
Thus, **tranquilizing the body** means **preserving the true essence**.
The **true person** who **transforms in the womb** and **rises from the bones**,
Their **qi** is **refined as essential as gold and stone**,
Never **exceeding the nine-one count**.
I have the **Dragon-Tiger Precept**:
**Green Dragon** winding, winding—
The world finds it hard to meet.
**Sinking and floating**, undetermined,
**Coming and going**, no trace to follow.
**Descend**, it reaches the **nine abysses**,
**Ascend**, it soars to the **supreme void**—
**Encounter water**, it **transforms**,
**Lifted to the West**, it **is bound**.
When **yin reaches its peak**, **yang is born**,
**Yang fulfills yin’s function**—
**Spirit** is the **leader**,
**Water** is the **follower**.
When **yin transforms into yang**, **spirit is clear**—
**Blow**, and **mist arises**,
**Transform**, and **it becomes boundless**—
**Nine times nine**, it **turns and unites**,
**Three times three**, the **Dao is fused**.
**White Tiger** is **frail and delicate**,
**Bound in the West**, it **abandons the Dragon**.
The **Tiger’s power**,
Can **equal a thousand oxen**—
When it **meets the Green Dragon**, **its head bows in an instant**.
The **Dragon passes through nine fires**, the **Tiger submits without confusion**;
**They embrace mutually**, **as husband and wife**.
The **Dragon does not transform without water**,
The **Tiger does not subdue without fire**—
**Water** is the **Dragon’s den**,
**Fire** is the **Tiger’s medium**—
**Nature follows its course**,
**Harmony unites like clay**—
The **Dragon soars to the heavens**,
The **Tiger mourns and weeps**.

**The Vermilion Bird Precept** says:
**Vermilion Bird’s fire essence**—
**Fire does not dwell in the city**—
**Fire transforms into earth**,
**White Tiger solidifies its form**,
**Blazing flames**—
**In an instant**, it **does not pause**,
**To govern it** requires **method**,
**To refine it** requires **nameless stillness**—
**Emerald-green, pure-white**,
**Different grasses, distinct essences**,
**The first of black**, **the spirit of white**—
**One left, two palaces**,
**Hesitating**, **spirit welcomes**—
**Fire flourishes in the city**,
**Fire brings glory**—
**Trembling and towering**,
**Wood rises in honor**—
**Desiring entry, yet not entering**,
**Now yellow, now green**,
**Suddenly black, suddenly purple**—
**Losing completion**, **yet not failing**,
**Focus the heart**, **lock the will**—
Then **its path is naturally level**.

**The Black Tortoise Precept** says:
**With spirit and pattern**,
**Like rain, like clouds**—
**Capable of the ordinary, capable of the sage**,
**Like mortal man, like the true**—
**Entering fire**, it **does not change**,
**Straddling water**, it **dwells nearby**—
**Nine Dragon’s path**, **Eight Guàn’s ford**,
**The leader of elixir**, **guest of golden fluid**—
**As sovereign, as subject**—
**Lose its self**, and **the body is lost**.
**Depart**, and **mercury departs**,
**Arrive**, and **mercury arrives**—
**Like dust accumulating**,
**Only the sea treasures it**.
**Ingesting it** brings **death**,
**Refining it** brings **life**—
Some **make it *lí***,
Some **make it *yīn***—
**Obtaining fire**, one **attains sainthood**,
**Repelling water**, one **attains dual gold**—
When **elixir is complete**, **preserve it in the heart**.

**The Precept of Four Matters Returning to Three** says:
**Nine tripods’ count**,
**Four matters’ work**—
**All return to the leader**,
**Nine chapters follow**—
**Eight times eight returns to nine**,
**The elixir’s refinement**—
**Black Tortoise** is the **Dragon’s envoy**,
**Vermilion Bird** is the **Tiger’s child**—
When **its law and symbol are met**,
**Eight unites, four harmonizes**,
**Six times six accumulates intent**—
**Can be yang, can be yin**,
**As heart, as intestine**,
Then **it becomes yellow gold**.

**The Precept of Six Sixes Uniting with Earth’s Count** says:
**The Dao of dark-yellow**,
**The pattern of heaven and earth**—
**Nine** is its **count**,
**Yang** is its **length**—
**Mutually transforming**, it **creates myriad things**,
**Heaven and earth fully contain**,
**As one, as three**—
**Its origin is now revealed**—
**Eight nodes’ count**,
**Great and strong**—
**One to one, nine to nine**,
**Magnificent and resplendent**—
**Pure and turbid** stand **distinct**,
**Beside the sun and moon**—
**One, seven, five, three**,
**As the *jì* and *gāng***—
**Response lies within**,
**Manifestation spreads without**.

**The Precept of Earth Uniting with Heaven’s Count** says:
**The Dragon-Tiger Dao**,
**The scripture of heaven and earth**—
**Sun and moon’s count**,
**Must be **fixed in brightness**—
From **this gate**, **take yin and yang**,
The **earth’s count Dao**,
Is the **constant of four and six**—
**Clarifying its yin**,
**Borrowing yang to follow**—
When **yin transforms into yang**, **its light is dim and hazy**,
**Earth connects with heaven**,
**Shares with sun and moon**—
At **this great work**, **the earth’s count is refined**.
When **yin and yang are consumed and refined**—
**Yin departs, yang thins**,
The **heavenly Dao** **intersects**...

「Eight and nine having returned,
Its **yang** has reversed—

Within the realm of **yang**,
The **nine counts** of life’s emergence are revealed.
**Sensing** the **qi** of yin and yang,
The **mixed chaos** of nine portions coalesces into the **nine tripods**.
When the **nine tripods**’ counts are complete,
Yellow gold is formed, and **elixir of immortality** is attained.

**The Precept of the Eight Trigrams Returning the Elixir** says:
**Qián** is **Heaven**,
**Kūn** is **Earth**—
Transform **Earth** into **Heaven**,
Lead becomes **one Qián**,
Following it in rotation—
The **yang**-infused **Kūn** is fully realized.
The **nine tripods’ divine water**,
A **mysterious** within the **mysterious**—
The **elixir** arises from **fire’s transformation**,
Water as **unyielding yin**,
The **Flowering Pool** as **Kūn’s vessel**,
Divine water, elixir, and lead—
One to the left, three to the right,
Three departures, three arrivals at its edges—
**Yang** vast, **yin** diminutive—
Remove **yang**, return the **elixir**—
Eight, seven, six, five—
The **Flowering Pool**’s vessel is secured,
The **counts of three and five**,
Where the **Five Phases** migrate—
The **Eight Trigrams’** first exchange,
**Qián** and **Kūn** reciprocating.

**The Precept of Entering and Exiting the Void** says:
**Heaven and Earth’s counts**,
**Yin** soft, **yang** firm—
Within **yang**, **yin** resides;
Within **yin**, **yang** resides—
Transform **yin** into **yang**,
Transform **yang** into **yin**—
**Yin and yang** in reverse,
Now floating, now sinking,
**Sun and moon’s Four Qi**,
**Heaven and Earth** intersecting and encroaching—
One departure, two arrivals,
As **gǔi** and **rén**—
Entering and exiting the **Void**,
The **sage’s refined essence**.

**The Precept of the Masterless Way** says:
Dividing **yang** and **yin**,
**Time and day** do not align—
Sinking and floating unseen,
Upper and lower disjointed,
Scattered yet seemingly whole,
Faintly heard yet distant—
It forms my **bones**,
Lengthens my **soul**—
My **body** does not perish,
And I dwell beside **Heaven**.

**The Precept of the Eight Refined Stones** says:
**Eight Refined Stones’** transformation,
**Four Arriving Winds**—
The **Nine Extremes’** truth,
Encroaching in coming and going—
The **Dao** is nurtured in the **abdomen**,
**Time** follows the **Way**—
Preserve **yang** as **yin**,
Reverse and conceal the **stomach**—
Divide **Heaven**, enter **Earth**,
By means of the **Eight Refined Stones**—
Gold grains, silver mud,
Variation and growth stand firm.

**The Precept of Saltpeter and Steel Uniting** says:
Two substances **receiving qi**,
**Yin and yang** united in harmony—
Eight departures, nine arrivals,
Their coming is unobstructed—
Three births, nine washings,
Upper and lower in concord—
**Heaven and Earth’s Dao**,
**Sun and moon** all in accord—
Follow **Heaven’s law**, align with **natural principle**,
The **Two Refined Stones’** achievement.

**The Precept of the Movement of Yin and Yang** says:
**Heaven** adheres to **sun and moon** for **clarity**,
**Four Qi** for **sequence**—
**Eight Nodes** broadly shift,
**Six Yin** distantly align—
Excessive **transformation** makes it **firm**,
Halfway **listings** mark the **yin-yang Dao**.

Thus, the **elixir’s counts**,
Two **yang** becoming two **yin**,
Both as **great function**—
To **settle the Four Extremes**,
Born from the **nine tripods**,
And **one yang** concealed—
The **nine transformations** of **Dao**.

**The Precept of Mercury Uniting with the Great Yang** says:
The **sage** of **transmutation**,
None surpass **mercury**—
Born as **stone**,
Transformed as **treasure**;
Within **fire** as **jewel**,
And neighbor to **ghosts**—
Exposed, it reveals the **sage’s Dao**,
Concealed, it communes with the **True Person**;
Its **principle** aligns with the **Eight Nodes**,
All **celestial beings** revere it.

**The Precept of Lead and Tin’s Success** says:
Lead and mercury unite with the **Way**,
The **essence** is inherently true—
**Sun and moon’s** grandeur,
**Heaven and Earth’s** **spirit**—
The **nine tripods’** beginning,
Both attain **clarity and peace**;
The **abode of golden liquid**,
Where **clear and turbid** divide—
Lead’s vessel, elixir’s gate,
The **Four Symbols** united.

**The Precept of Lead’s Golden Liquid** says:
Five metals are the **world’s treasures**,
Forming **liquid** is the **world’s spirit**—
Obtaining **yin water** to unite with **Black Tortoise**,
**Sensing** the **transformative force** to become **ultimate truth**—
Preserve the **great**, the **small** will follow,
**Yin** transforms, **yang** renews—
As one attains its **mercury**,
Thus becomes the **True Person**.

**Mercury**—
When it meets **warmth**, it **transforms**,
When it meets **water**, it **divides**.

**The Precept of White Lead’s Golden Liquid** says:
Purple **cavern**, Jade **stream**—
Its **spirit** transcends to **Heaven**,
The **elixir’s** first principle,
The **Eight Trigrams’** foremost—
Great as **yin’s** foundation,
Reversed as **yang’s** renewal—
**Sun and moon’s counts**,
Its **Way** alone stands **illuminated**.

**The Precept of Iron, Stone, and Copper’s Divine Liquid** says:
Five **layers** are **attached**,
Three **threes** return together—
One as **first**, the **foundation** of **Heaven and Earth**—
How does **Heaven** attain itself?
Metals and stones **converge**—

「Desiring to enter yet unable to—
Add **three** and **four**,
Follow **seven**, follow **eight**,
Yet also can rely upon them.

The **Way** of **nine nine**,
Divided by **two** and **four**,
Though its **roots** may differ,
Its **virtue/power** converges at one **branch**.

The **Precept** summarizing the earlier **elixir’s** **Way** says:
Guard **one yin** and know **one yang**,
Circulate the **Five Phases** to **vitalize** the **Original Qi**,
Know the **breath’s** **movement** to **transform** the **stagnant form**.

The **method** of **Golden Liquid** lies within **Nine Springs** and **Seven Stones**.
**Nine Springs** and **Seven Stones**—
They exist within the **Flowering Pool**.

The **Flowering Pool** births the **Five Metal Flowers**,
The **Five Metal Flowers** fulfill the **Nine Cauldrons**.

Then **Xuanwu** strides northward,
**Zhuhuang** soars southward,
**Baihu** sits in repose,
**Qinglong** gallops at will—
The **affairs** of **Returning the Elixir** are complete.

Thus, when **yin** transforms yet **yang** is **extinguished**,
This is the way of **death**!

When **True** is **stored** and **yin-yang** are not **extinguished**,
This is the **True Person**!

**Dao/Way** **Pivot** **Scroll** the eleventh ends. #1 **Fire** [originally *"flame"*]: revised to *"flame"* in the **essential text**.
#2 **Six** [based on context and subsequent text]: should read *"Heaven"*.

**Dao/Way** **Pivot** **Scroll** the twelfth
To the **Master of Supreme Wandering**, **Zeng Tao**’s collection.

**Still-Gold Chapter**

The primal ancestor of **Heaven** and **Earth**, the numinous essence of the cosmos—
Within its depths lies the utmost **precision**, hidden in the **void** and **dark**.

The **Moon Hare**’s son, Liu Zhaoyuan of Yan, said:
*"The **Still-Gold** is the **qi** of **Heaven** and **Earth**, the numinous essence of the cosmos;
The primal ancestor of **Heaven** and **Earth**, the essence of **Sun** and **Moon**.*

Within its **flickering** form, it is contained by the **Two Poles**;
Within its **fathomless** depths, it embraces the **One Thing**.

Pairing **Jia** and **Geng**, fixing **Li** and **Kan**;
Severing **Water** and **Fire**, spreading **flame** and **frost**;
Ranking **Lord** and **Minister**, unleashing **Dragon** and **Tiger**;
Causing **yin** and **yang** to **return** **lead** and **mercury**;
With fixed divisions and unerring seasons—
Nine **transformations** yield **Golden Elixir**, three years yield **Jade Elixir**.

Thus, what I call **"Return"** is the **Return** to the **Seven Sources**’ subtlety,
And the **Nine Transformations**’ **Heavenly Pass**.

**Gold** is the **true lead** of **cinnabar-mercury**, the **true elixir** of **yellow sprouts**.
Here, the **Nine Numinous Deities** of **Spirit** gather under **Non-Action’s** single **Master**,
All converging in this **scroll**.

**Secret Verse**:
*"South and North interlace, West binds—creation’s flow outstrips Yu’s feat;
One steed gallops past the Three Isles, six **Deities** linger in the Five Lakes;
Boiling, wrapping, refining—**Elixir** and **Snow** are sealed,
Purifying **Flower Pool**, dispersing the **Black Wind**;
Lightning flashes, opening the **Luminous World**,
Only at night does the **True Dragon** reveal itself."*

**Master of Supreme Wandering** said:
*"How profound! This is the **Still-Gold’s** subtlest mystery!"

**Return-to-Origin: Upper Scroll**

At its origin, **Original Qi** is as large as a **millet grain**;
When **gathered**, it forms; when **dispersed**, it decays.

**Humans** are one of the **Three Powers**.
**Heaven** does not collapse, **Earth** does not sink—yet mortals perish in multitudes. Why?

**Humans** share **Spirit-Life** of **43,200 days**, **Divine Qi** of **36,000 **Original Yang****, and **True Qi** weighing **384 *cai* (38.4 *jin*)**,
Resonating internally with **Heaven**—yet they remain unaware, letting it scatter,
Thus crossing the **Midway** and entering the **Pass of Death**.

**Heaven** is the **Six Yangs** undisturbed, yet to act or disperse.
If one cultivates thus, the **True Immortal’s Way** is attained.

From age **fifteen to twenty-five**, if **dispersal** ceases not, **48 *cai*** are lost,
And what remains aligns with **Encounter** (*Lǜn*).
If **lust** intensifies for ten years, **48 *cai*** are lost,
And what remains aligns with **Withdrawal** (*Dùn*).
If **nurturing** is unknown, another ten years pass, **48 *cai*** are lost,
And what remains aligns with **Opposition** (*Pǐ*), the **Central Qi** of **Heaven** and **Earth**.
If **nurturing** is unknown, another five years pass, **72 *cai*** are lost,
And what remains aligns with **Observation** (*Guàn*).
If **nurturing** is unknown, another five years pass, **96 *cai*** are lost,
And what remains aligns with **Decay** (*Bó*).
If **nurturing** is unknown, the **64 Hexagrams** reach their end—**Original Qi** is exhausted,
And it aligns with **Earth** (*Kūn*).
**Earth** is **pure yin**.
Only **An Valley** sustains life—its name is **Gǒushòu** (*"Temporary Longevity"*).

Yet if a **Clear Teacher** reveals the **Mysterious Gate**, one may yet approach the **Way**.
The *Yellow Court Scripture* says:
*"Even at twenty years, one may still **Return**—this is what is meant."*

After the **Southern Solstice**, I secretly draw **Heaven** and **Earth’s** **True Qi**, calling it **"Ascension"**;
At the **Northern Solstice**, I call it **"Descension."**
By **year**, **month**, **day**, and **hour**, all contain **yin** and **yang**.
The **year** marks the **Two Solstices**,
The **month** marks the **Two Crescents**,
The **day** marks from **Child** to before **Horse**,
And the **hour** follows likewise.
Thus, following the **Law**, one may **compensate** and **Return yin** to the **Intestines**.

A **hundred-year-old tree**, its **sap** drained and withered—
If I graft its **young shoots**, it thrives anew.
How is **Human** different?

If one **consolidates qi** and **nurtures essence**,
**Essence** nurtures **Spirit**, **Spirit** clings to the **Body**—
Then **qi** abides eternally.

If one obtains a **Clear Teacher** to impart the **Secret Key**,
And follows, cultivating with **Child** as the pivot,
Turning the **Heavenly Cycle** in due measure—
After one year of refining the **Golden Cauldron**, **Original Qi** increases by **48 *cai***,
Aligning with **Recovery** (*Fǔ*).
After two years, the **Red Dragon** moves, inheriting **Spring’s qi**,
As **mist** descends, **sea-waters** surge at **Pénglái**,
The **Golden Cauldron** opens, using the **Gentle Wind**,
And **Qi** increases by **48 *cai***, aligning with **Approach** (*Lín*).
After three years, the **Two Qi** intermingle—
The **Cauldron** radiates brilliance.
**Dragon** roars, **Tiger** howls, **Souls** flash like **lightning**,
And **Qi** increases by **48 *cai***, aligning with **Great Harmony** (*Tài*), the **symbol of **Established Spring***.
If cultivation is assiduous, **Qi** increases by **72 *cai***,
Aligning with **Great Strength** (*Dàzhuàng*), where **Fire’s** light is full,
The **Red Dragon** emerges, **wind** and **thunder** multiply,
**Jars** hold **Sun** and **Moon**, **Cauldron’s** waves turn **emerald**.
**Great Strength** is the **symbol of **Established Summer***.
Thus, **Evil Qi** cannot enter—**Qi** increases by **92 *cai***,
Aligning with **Centrality** (*Yǎo*), where **White Tiger** is subdued and **Green Dragon** bound.
After six years of accumulation, the **Inner Recovery** aligns with **Heaven** again.

Then **Fire’s** light blazes—**the furnace** turns **red**.
At **Child** and **Horse** hours, the **True Dragon** and **Tiger** are recognized,
And one may **divide** them at will.

Yet the **essence** of **True Cultivation** lies in **abandoning greed** and **cherishing love-desire**.
Once cultivated:
One year—**essence** is renewed,
Two years—**marrow** is renewed,
Three years—**bones** are renewed,
Four years—**sinews** are renewed,
Five years—**hair** is renewed,
Six years—**form** is renewed.
**Inner qi** does not exit, **outer qi** does not enter—
This is called the **True Person**.

**Return-to-Origin: Lower Scroll**

**Master of Supreme Wandering** said:
*"The **Way of Change**—how subtle and profound!"*

In ancient times, **hexagrams** were formed with **two, three, four**,
Or with **three, four, five**—
This is the **mutual transformation**.

The **Perfect Person’s** method of **True Cultivation** begins with **Upper Nine** as the head, **Initial Six** as the feet, and **Two, Three, Four, Five** as the body. The transformations of the six lines flow cyclically, like the **Nourishing Vessels** and **Defensive Vessels** moving through the four seasons.

Thus, the sixty-four **hexagrams** align with the **Heaven** and **Earth**. If I master their numbers, I shall harmonize with **Heaven** and **Earth**.

What sustains humanity is **form**; what sustains **form** is **qi**.
When **qi** is gathered, **form** coalesces;
When **qi** disperses, **form** decays.
To know what sustains and to **nurture** it—
Is this not the **Way of Change**?

My dwelling should be on **soft mats**, my clothing thick,
And I must conform to the **season’s** needs.
Thus, at **Winter Solstice** or on **Day Jiazi**,
After **Zi**, I loosen my clothes, bind my hair, and sit cross-legged.

Binding my hair—**drawing in vital qi**.
I tap my teeth thirty-six times, rubbing my palms together,
Then warm them and wipe my eyes,
Cover my ears for a moment—
A faint sound, like a bell, arises within.
I do this three times,
Then rub my face until warm,
Slowly move my tongue to **lick the upper palate** twelve times,
The **lower palate** twelve times,
The **outer teeth and inner upper lip** twelve times,
The **inner lower lip** twelve times—
This is called **The Vermilion Dragon’s Plowing**.

When saliva arises, I rinse my mouth,
Filling it with warmth, then swallow three times.
Each swallow must draw in **inner qi**—
**Inner qi** is taken by closing the mouth and inhaling through the nose.
I send it to the **Lower Elixir Field** beneath the navel,
Imagining a **cauldron** and guiding the **qi** inside.
Then I imagine the **heart-fire** as a flame descending to ignite the **cauldron**,
Thus thirty-six breaths form **One Yang Line**.

Next, I repeat the licking as before,
Rinsing and swallowing again—
Twenty-four breaths form **One Yin Line**.
I do this five times, accumulating **Five Yin Lines**—
This is called **Return**.

When the **Return** **hexagram** is complete,
I rest my breath briefly,
Imagining my **qi** as yellow clouds swirling above the **spleen and stomach**.
After a while, I imagine the **qi** returning to beneath the navel,
Its form like yellow soil covering the **cauldron**.
Then I comb my hair a hundred strokes,
Lie down for a short while—
Thus, the day’s work is done.

Each month completes one **hexagram**, cycling endlessly:
When the month reaches **Zi**, it is **Return**;
When it reaches **Chou**, it is **Taming**;
When it reaches **Yin**, it is **Peace**;
When it reaches **Mao**, it is **Great Strength**;
When it reaches **Chen**, it is **The Clinging**;
When it reaches **Si**, it is **Heaven**;
When it reaches **Wu**, it is **Encounter**;
When it reaches **Wei**, it is **Retreat**;
When it reaches **Shen**, it is **Opposition**;
When it reaches **You**, it is **Contemplation**;
When it reaches **Xu**, it is **Shedding**;
When it reaches **Hai**, it is **Earth**.

**Jade Vessel Chapter**
The essence of **Golden Elixir** lies in **Divine Water, Flowering Pool**—
Speaking of its use, it relies on **water and fire**.

**Zhongtiao Zi**, whose surname was **Zhang**,
Was later hidden in **Zhongtiao**, hence his name.
I had heard of the **Golden Elixir’s** essence in **Divine Water, Flowering Pool**,
But I did not grasp its meaning.
Later, I met **Taiyi True Person**, named **Yuangui**, at **Taishan**,
Who revealed its secret:

*"Stone is firm, yet water is yielding—
Which of the Five Phases will rest?
How do I know the virtuous maiden’s fate is submerged?
The stone’s form lies buried in the sand,
While water flows away."*

He then asked: *"Do you know of the **Flowering Pool**?
**Flower** is **fire**, **Pool** is **water**—
They are the **lofty keys** of **Heaven** and **Earth**."*

**Zhongtiao Zi** said: *"What use does **Golden Water, Flowering Pool**—
The Five Phases’ **metal and water**—have?"*

**Taiyi True Person** replied:
*"All things naturally embrace **yin** and **yang** to form.
Without the **essence-qi** of **sun and moon**,
Without the maturation of **yin** and **yang**,
How could there be birth and growth?

Moreover, humanity’s life begins in the womb,
Where **yin** and **yang** interact to form.
After ten months, when **yin** and **yang** are complete, life emerges.
The **True Nature** is like **mercury** hidden in sand,
Born from **true gold**—
Thus, the **Golden Elixir’s** marvel lies in **yin** and **yang**,
Refining **lead** into **mercury**."

Clarify the Five Phases,
Discern the **qi** of seasons—**cold and heat** interacting,
**Yin** and **yang** mutually applied.
**Yin** obtains **yang** and matures,
**Yang** obtains **yin** and ascends—
This is the **essence of Returning Elixir**.

Wood has **rigidity and hollowness**,
Things have **sweetness and bitterness**—
Though they share **yin** and **yang qi**, their natures differ.
Thus, the **Golden Elixir** must align with the **mysteries of sun and moon**,
With **Dragon** and **Tiger** rising and falling,
With **water** and **fire** in motion.
If one attunes to the **proper seasonal signs**, great success follows.

**Zhongtiao Zi** asked: *"Where does **lead** and **mercury** come from?"*

**Taiyi True Person** said:
*"**Lead** is the **White Tiger**;
**Mercury** is the **Green Dragon**—
Yet they are not ordinary substances.
**Mercury** is born from **gold**,
**Gold sand** is produced from **lead**—
The treasure of **long life**.
This **Way** must be passed only to those of **moral virtue, compassion, and wisdom**.
But those who are **arrogant, cruel, greedy, or domineering**—
Who **bully others, indulge in wine and lust, or are miserly**—
Should not be taught."*

After **Zhongtiao Zi** received the **Way**,
Two years later, he met **Ying’er**, the servant of **Shuangyang County Clerk Cao**.
The servant was **Taiyi’s** attendant,
Sent to complete **Zhongtiao Zi’s** cultivation.

He said to **Zhongtiao Zi**:
*"The **Three Stars** are **water**—
The **White Tiger’s** essence,
Descending as a treasure.
If refined, it can become **Returning Elixir**.
The **Room Star** is **wood**—
The **Green Dragon’s** essence.
When **sun and moon** align,
And **water and fire** pair,
They unite as **husband and wife**—
Those who gather them return together,
Those who separate them struggle to reunite."*

The **gold, lead, silver, mercury, and cinnabar**—
these are the treasures that ascend to **sainthood**.
**Zhongtiao Zi** was suddenly struck with great alarm,
and so the **True Person of Taiyi** revealed to him the **secret of water and fire**.

The servant said:
*"This is the **vital essence of the Great Sun**,
which transforms heaven and earth,
and commands ghosts and spirits.
When cultivated, **clouds rise, winds stir, dragons and tigers unite**,
and **changes occur in secret resonance**—
the **Five Phases** harmonize,
and only **heavenly beings and humans** can comprehend it."

**Zhongtiao Zi** asked:
*"When will my **medicine** be complete?"*

The servant replied:
*"When the furnace is formed, **One Yang** arises,
and **pure Yin** is exhausted.
**Heaven and Earth’s two *qi*** are divided between south and north,
and **Yin and Yang** establish their positions,
holding the **central alignment of Sun and Moon**.

The servant further instructed him in the **Ten Chapters of Taiyi’s Jade Vessel**.
Its essence is thus:
*"The **Room Star** and **Day Star** are the **Green Dragon** and **White Tiger**,
while **Sun and Moon** are the **Jade Emperor** and **Black Tortoise**.
To know the **Great Dao’s** foundation, the **mysterious origin**,
one must obtain the **central *Wu* and *Ji* Earth**—
the **Room Star** and **Day Star**,
the **Sun and Moon**—
all are called **lead and mercury**.

In the **Great Elixir Scripture**:
**Divine *qi*** is the **medicine**,
and **heaven and earth** are the **furnace**.
Observe the **water clock**,
and harmonize the **symbols of the *Yijing***—
**Yi Cheng Zi**, surnamed **Peng Zhongkan**,
a native of **Tiantai**,
once encountered a **perfected sage**,
who told him:
*'The **Dao of Non-Action** surpasses nothing more than **golden elixir**.
To attain the **Dao**, one must follow the **golden symbols**.*
Thus, he gathered **gold** from **Lishui**,
sought **jade** from **Kungang**,
and only then could he proceed.

**Yi Cheng Zi** understood its essence,
and so recorded its words:
*'The **Great Medicine** is **lead and mercury**.
The **origin of lead and mercury**,
through the **refinement and transformation of the Five Phases**,
is achieved by dividing **mercury** to form **lead**.
Thus, **lead** is the **mother of the Five Metals**.
**Lead** has dross—
when the **Five Metals** approach it, they wither and turn black.
Yet **true white gold** emerges
from the **grinding of lead**,
refined by **water and fire** into its genuine form.
Thus, when **gold and mercury** blend,
they soften and yield like clay.

**Lead and mercury** are **father and son**,
and when they meet,
they become **husband and wife**—
this is the principle of **mutual control**.
They cling to each other,
never parting,
as when **mercury meets gold and settles**.
**Lead is refined to reveal gold**,
and **mercury is purified without loss**—
this is the **Great Medicine**.

The **Scripture** says:
*'The **Dao** generates **One**,
**One** generates **Two**,
**Two** generates **Three**,
**Three** generates all things.*
Thus, one knows that **lead and mercury** share a **single origin**,
for this is the **One generating Two**.
Each occupies its own realm,
embodying the **principle of mutual affinity**.
The **Scripture** also says:
*'The **crane’s cry** lingers in the **Yin**,
and its young harmonize with it.*
Does it not refer to this?
Thus, **lead and mercury** are **Yin and Yang**,
**floating and sinking**,
the **single origin of two substances**.*

In human life, **divine *qi*** is the root,
and **blood and *qi*** are the foundation.
For those who **practice the Dao**,
**divine *qi*** is the **Great Medicine**.

**Lead and mercury** are the **golden elixir**,
the **ultimate attainment** of the ancients.
If one does not know the **golden elixir**
but only clings to the **Room Star techniques**,
one may live to a hundred years
but cannot attain **immortality**—
why is this?
Because there is no **divine *qi***.

**Lead and mercury** are **Sun and Moon**;
**Sun and Moon** are **water and fire**;
**water and fire** are **Dragon and Tiger**;
**Dragon and Tiger** are **Yin and Yang**;
**Yin and Yang** are **heaven and earth**;
**heaven and earth** are **Qian and Kun**—
**Qian and Kun** are the **gateway to the *Yijing***,
the **parents of all hexagrams**.

The **Qian Transmission** says:
*'There are **six times** that align with its position—
why is this?
There are **heavenly times** and **earthly times**,
which, when **scattered**, become **three**,
and when **unified**, become **one**.
The **song** says:
*"The **second and eighth** are **Zi**, the **third and seventh** are **Hai**,
the **fourth and sixth** are **Xu**, the **fifth and tenth** are **You** and **Dui**,
the **ninth and proper** are **Chou**, the **eleventh and twelfth** are **Le**—
the **Great Void** unites at **Mao** within.
These are the **twelve heavenly times**.*

Again, it says:
*"Five watches, two marks—
the **ninth month** is proper.
The **hare and parrot** mark the **four sounds of the water clock**,
and at **three watches and seven marks**, the **flat dawn** is **Yin time**,
while **four watches and six marks** mark **Sunrise**—
no distinction from **Yin time**.
At the **fifth month**, the **Sun’s elevation** is three *zhang* above the earth.
At the **tenth and twelfth months**, **four watches and two marks**,
as if encountering the **eleventh month**,
when **four watches and the first mark** align with **Yin time**—
this reveals the **earthly Yin time**."*

The **Great Sun’s** **footprint** spans the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**,
moving **one degree per day and night**,
and completing a **heavenly circuit** in a year with **one fen and two li** remaining.

The **stars, celestial bodies, Sun, and Moon** flow **eastward**;
the **heavenly Dao** revolves **westward**.
In **one day and night**, heaven completes its **circuit**—
this is **384 degrees**.

The **Great Yin** (Moon) has **four seasonal nodes** in a month,
from **new moon** to the **fifteenth day**,
one **slow and one swift**,
and from the **sixteenth day** to the **end of the month**,
also one **slow and one swift**.
If they do not **align**, it is not **new moon**;
if they do not **oppose**, it is not **full moon**.

When **slow**, it moves **twelve degrees per day**;
when **swift**, it moves **fourteen degrees and seventy-four and a half fractions per day**;
when **evenly paced**, it moves **thirteen degrees and thirty-seven fractions per day**.

Those who **practice the Dao** must observe the **degrees of Sun and Moon’s movement**,
their **orbits, waxing, and waning**,
and the **cycles of the Five Phases**—
why is this?
The **Four Seasons** have their **symbolic nodes**,
and the **Five Phases** have their **terminal numbers**.
When one attains the **Dao**, the **law of the Great Yin** becomes clear.

What is the **Great Yin**?
It is the **separated essence of the Sun**,
and the **Kan *Wu* Moonlight**—
Thus, **lead and mercury** are **Qian and Kun**.
**Qian** is the **father**, **Kun** is the **mother**—
those who receive the **father’s *qi*** become **male**,
those who receive the **mother’s *qi*** become **female**.
**Qian and Kun** together generate **six children**—
this is what is meant.

The **six positions** each have **thirty days** as their node.
Two and three make six—
this is **360 degrees**, the **Dao of thirty spokes converging at one hub**.

**Jia** is the **fifteenth day**,
when the **month is full**—
the **Qian symbol** appears at **dusk**.
**Yi** is the **thirtieth day**,
the **end of the month**—
this is the **loss of companions**, the **Kun symbol**.
**Bing** is the **eighth day**—
the **Gèn symbol**.
**Ding** is the **twenty-third day**—
the **Dui symbol**.
**Geng** is the **second day**—
the **reunion of companions**, the **Zhèn symbol**,
when it appears at **dusk**."

**Xīn** is the **sixteenth day**, seen at **dawn**—the **Xùn symbol**.

**Rèn** is the **empty position**; **Wù** is **Kǎn**, the **moon**.
**Guǐ** is the **empty position**.
This is the **Way**, returning to **earth**.

**Jia and Yi** complete seven cycles and return to **Ji**.
**Gēng and Xīn** complete seven cycles and return to **Wù**.
**Wù and Ji** are the **central tripod of the palace**.

Thus, it begins with **Jia and Yi** and ends with **Qián and Kūn**.

The **two bodies** follow the **sun’s path along the Yellow Way** and the **moon’s path along the Red Way**.

**Liú Hóng** said:
The **Qián symbol** has nine paths.
The **Great Sun** reaches its northernmost point at the **summer solstice**, emerging from **Yín** and entering **Xū**.
At the **winter solstice**, it reaches its southernmost point, emerging from **Chén** and entering **Shēn**.
The **heavenly wheel turns counterclockwise**, completing one revolution of day and night—**384 degrees**—
amounting to **2,932 li and 30 steps per degree**.
After the **winter solstice**, it enters **increase**; after the **summer solstice**, it enters **decrease**.

**Yì Chéngzǐ** said:
*"Is this not the Dao?"*

**Lead and mercury** are **one**.
**One** is the **origin of the Five Phases**.
The **Great Unfolding’s number** is **fifty**, yet its use is **forty-nine**—the **Five Phases**.
Each of the **Five Phases** has **five**, making **twenty-five**.
Heaven has **Five Phases**, earth has **Five Phases**—
their two positions combine, each with its **pairings**, forming **fifty**.
This is the **extreme number of the Five Phases, Twelve Positions, Three Cycles, and Yin-Yang qi**,
cycling endlessly.

The **Sage** knows **One** as **lead and mercury**,
thus **embracing One** and refining for **forty-nine days**,
until the **sacred embryo** forms in the **Earth-Thunder Recovering hexagram**—
**one yang beneath five yin**.

The **Recovering hexagram** says:
*"On the seventh day, it returns."*

Its manifestation reveals the **heart of Heaven and Earth**,
so a person’s **seven souls** are complete at **forty-nine days of life**,
and at death, the **seven souls depart** in **forty-nine days**—
this is the **Returning number**, the **extreme of yin and yang**.

Heaven and Earth are the **Five Phases**, yet neither has an **even count** in their generation.
**Qián**, the **yang essence**, is paired with **odd numbers**;
**Kūn**, the **yin essence**, is paired with **even numbers**.
**Five** is the **generative number**; **ten** is the **completing number**.
**Generating** means **mutual generation**; **overcoming** means **mutual completion**.
**Lead and mercury**—are they not the **mediators of yin and yang**?

**Qián and Kūn** are the **sun and moon**; the **sun and moon** are the **Cháng**.
There is **Cháng** only because there are **Qián and Kūn**,
and there are **Qián and Kūn** only because there is **Cháng**,
and there is **Cháng** only because there is the **Recovering hexagram**.
Thus it is said:
*"If Qián and Kūn are destroyed, the Cháng cannot be seen."*
The **Cháng** is **lead and mercury**.

From **Two Principles** come **Four Symbols**, and from **Four Symbols** come **Eight Trigrams**.
If there were no **lead and mercury**, **Qián and Kūn** would nearly cease!

The **twelve hours of day and night** total **100 moments**,
each hour divided into **sixty parts**—**eight moments** per hour.
Only **Chén, Xū, Chǒu, and Wèi** belong to **earth**, called the **Four Seasons**.
Each **double-hour** has **nine moments** for one hour,
with the **Four Seasonal double-hours** each contributing **one moment**,
divided among the **four孟 (Mèng) double-hours** as **twelve parts**,
and the **four仲季 (Zhòng-Jì) double-hours** as **twenty parts**,
leaving **twenty parts** in their original positions—
thus, each hour is **eight moments and twenty parts**.
Each **moment** yields **115 breaths**,
so eight moments make **920 breaths**,
plus the **twenty parts** of the **Zhòng-Jì double-hours**, forming **40 breaths**,
totaling **960 breaths**—this is **one hour**.

**Qí Bó** said:
*"One exhale and one inhale make one breath."*

Thus, when divided, it is **counted by parts**,
when measured by **moments**, it is **counted by moments**,
when measured by **hours**, it is **counted by hours**,
and when measured by **breaths**, it is **counted by breaths**—
so the **twelve hours** total **11,520 breaths**,
matching the **Great Unfolding’s extreme strategy of Qián-Kūn and the Five Cycles**.

Now, taking **120 breaths** as the standard,
**100 moments** naturally align with the **twelve hours of day and night**,
the **great key of yin and yang’s profound numbers**.

As for the **fire candidates of yin and yang**—
how does the **sun’s lead and mercury** compare?

The **Great Unfolding’s extreme number** spans **81 days**,
requiring **11,664 catties of charcoal**,
yielding **180**—**180 times 180**—
still resulting in **81**.
**144** remains.

A **year** has **384 days**; subtracting the **24 solar terms**,
**Kǎn and Lí** operate for **260 days**,
requiring **51,840 catties of charcoal**,
yielding **480 instances of 180**.
**81** becomes **648**—
thus, **one year’s charcoal** sustains **nine years’ days**,
and **three years’ charcoal** sustains **27 years’ days**.

**120 days** make **one cycle**, **one year** makes **three cycles**,
and **three years** make **nine cycles**.

There is a **method for refining the elixir**.
**Lead** is cast as **bait**—
so **lead** has **hooks, rods, coins, and bait**.
Without a **hook**, there is no **fishing**; without a **rod**, there is no **casting**.
Without **coins**, the fish will not rise.

**Charcoal** is the **fire’s fuel**, burned from **Fú-Sāng wood**.

**Kǎn** is **Zǐ (Child)**,
**Gèn** is **Chǒu-Yín (Ox-Tiger)**,
**Zhèn** is **Mǎo (Wood)**,
**Xùn** is **Chén-Sì (Dragon-Snake)**,
**Lí** resides centrally with **no fixed direction**,
**Kūn** is **Wèi-Shēn (Sheep-Monkey)**,
**Duì** is **Yǒu (Rooster)**,
**Qián** resides centrally with **no fixed direction**—
when observed in rotation, the **sixty-four hexagrams of Heaven and Earth** appear.

Observing the **Lunar Ordinances** reveals the **seasons of Heaven**.
In the **eleventh month**, the **sun is in Jī (Winnowing Basket)**,
setting behind the **eastern wall**,
with the **midday sun at one *hàn***,
and the **Big Dipper** aligned at the **beginning of Zǐ (Rat)**.

The **Wū Xián Classic** says:
*"The Dipper lies beneath the Celestial Pavilion,
beneath it is the **Tiānchéng Star**,
beneath the star is the **Gōu-Chén Constellation**,
and within **Gōu-Chén’s mouth** is the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Star**,
directly opposite the **Great Emperor Star**."*

The **Big Dipper** is the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Command**,
its first star is **Tiānshū (Celestial Pivot)**,
its second is **Huán (Ring)**,
its third is **Jī (Bead)**,
its fourth is **Quán (Scale)**,
its fifth is **Héng (Balance)**,
its sixth is **Wéiyáng (Enclosure of Yang)**,
and its seventh is **Yáo Guāng (Jade Light)**.

The Dipper has nine stars, but two are unseen.

Beneath it, I establish a **three-tiered altar**—
**water above, fire below**.

The *Yì (Classic of Change)* says:
*"Using nine [stars], one sees the **group of dragons without a head**—auspicious.
Again, it says:
**'Clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger'**—
the **gentleman** advances in **virtue** and cultivates his **practice**,
desiring to keep pace with the times.
To **embody virtue** as **action**,
to see the **visible Way** in daily conduct.
He who knows **advancement and retreat, survival and perishing**
yet does not lose his **correctness**—
is there not only the **sage**?

The **scholar** perceives the **Dao** as if mirrored in his palm.

The **eleventh month**—**Fù (Return)**—
is the **initial nine**, **fire rising at seven *liáng***¹;
the **twelfth month**—**Lín (Approach)**—
is the **nine-two**, **fire used at fourteen *liáng***;
the **first month**—**Tài (Peace)**—
is the **nine-three**, **fire used at twenty-one *liáng***;
the **second month**—**Dà Zhuàng (Great Strength)**—
is the **nine-four**, **fire doubled**;
the **third month**—**Yāng (Central Pivot)**—
is the **nine-five**, **the month of fire’s advance**;
the **fourth month**—**Qián (Creativity)**—
is the **upper nine**, **the month of the exultant dragon**;
the **fifth month**—**Qù (Encounter)**—
is the **initial six**;
the **sixth month**—**Dùn (Withdrawal)**—
is the **six-two**;
the **seventh month**—**Pǐ (Decay)**—
is the **six-three**, **all three requiring fire’s retreat**;
the **eighth month**—**Guān (Contemplation)**—
is the **six-four**, **when fire may be drawn out**;
the **ninth month**—**Bō (Shedding)**—
is the **six-five**, **when fire may be withdrawn**;
the **tenth month**—**Kūn (Receptivity)**—
is the **upper six**, **the month of fire’s extreme retreat**.

This is the **essence of water and fire**!

The **Master Yì’s song** says:
*"Lead and mercury govern the **Qián-Kūn (Creativity-Receptivity)** affairs like hemp,
Where else seek the **Heavenly Vehicle**?
The **Nine Schools** know only **sand-drawing mercury**,
The **immortal** can **refine mercury into sand**."*

The **Dao Gun** scroll concludes here.

**The *Zhǐ Xuān* (Pointing to the Mysterious) Chapter**

Non-substance, non-form—
Who can fathom its beginning?
Yet it has a destination:
The **Three Fields’ elixir**.

**Master Chunyang** said:
*"The Dao’s source, once manifested,*
*Gives rise to all things and forms.*
*Thus there is the **Jade Purity’s** sacred realm,*
*Where **Yuanshi** dwells supreme;*
*Next, the **Upper Purity’s** true realm,*
*Where **Yuánhuáng** resides;*
*Then the **Great Purity’s** immortal domain,*
*Where **Tàishàng** abides.*

*Below these, there are the realms of*
**Tàiwú (Great Non-Existence),**
**Tàixū (Great Emptiness),**
**Tàikōng (Great Void),**
**Tàizhì (Great Substance).**
*Tàizhì—*
*The chaos of Heaven and Earth’s beginning,*
*Its hue dark-yellow,*
*Like a parrot’s egg suspended in the Great Void.*

*The Southern Palace’s flying immortals*
*Advance ten million eight thousand li daily,*
*Crossing eight hundred kalpas,*
*Yet cannot escape this realm’s bounds.*

*Only he who grasps the Mysterious’ essence*
*May transcend into the **Three Purities**.*

*Chaos—*
*Like the great womb’s first conception,*
*Three hundred days until form takes man.*
*My elixir—three hundred days,*
*And qi gives birth to spirit.*

*Heaven like an inverted basin,*
*Earth like a flat stone.*
*Yang born beneath the earth,*
*Darkly bearing yin’s substance—*
*To reach pure yang’s realm,*
*Ascending to Heaven is hard;*
*Yin born within Heaven,*
*Darkly embracing yang’s essence—*
*To sink into pure yin,*
*Descending to Earth is hard.*

*At Winter Solstice, yang is born,*
*Accumulating eighteen decans to reach Heaven;*
*At Summer Solstice, yin is born,*
*Accumulating eighteen decans to reach Earth.*
*Rising and falling in cycle,*
*He who comprehends this*
*May equal Heaven and Earth.*

*Heaven and Earth are eighty-four thousand li apart,*
*Yet man’s heart and kidneys*
*Are but eight inches four divisions distant—*
*The principle of transmission,*
*Rising and falling, is one.*

*The sun and moon span eight hundred forty li:*
*The sun traverses **Qián (Creativity),**
*The moon traverses **Kūn (Receptivity).**
*The sun draws the moon’s shadow to become clear,*
*The moon draws the sun’s soul to become bright.*
*Clarity and brightness—*
*Their qi;*
*Essence and refinement—*
*Their substance;*
*Yin and yang—*
*Their Dao;*
*The tortoise and hare—*
*Their symbols;*
*Mao and You—*
*Their paths;*
*Day and night—*
*Their measure;*
*Their conjunction—*
*Their function.*
*I follow the laws of sun and moon,*
*And may traverse vast kalpas.*

*The Three Passes behind the elbow*
*Are like the three islands beyond the sea.*
*Without passing the three islands,*
*One cannot be called an immortal;*
*Without passing the three passes,*
*One cannot be called a Daoist.*

*Turn the flying golden crystal to the crown,*
*Not only to return to youth*
*But also to withdraw fire and extract lead.*

*The **Dòngtiān (Cavernous Heaven)***
*Is neither in Heaven above*
*Nor in Earth below—*
*It lies in the boundless void.*

*Encircled by twelve peaks,*
*With upper, middle, and lower tiers,*
*Thirty-six in number—*
*Like the upper **Three Fields** of man’s spiritual palace.*

*Returning and reversing the two Fields,*
*Qi and spirit intertwine—*
*This is my **Dòngtiān**.*

*The Dao gives birth to Heaven and Earth,*
*And man is born of the Dao.*
*Yet seven emotions disturb within,*
*Six desires entice without,*
*Heavy vapors rise in towers,*
*Golden tortoises leak below.*
*My qi—eight hundred ten zhang long—*
*Nine times nine, diminished,*
*First chaos, then sickness,*
*Weakness, aging,*
*Decay, and death.*

*Life cannot nourish itself,*
*Peak cannot gather,*
*Dispersion cannot be reclaimed,*
*Decay cannot be mended—*
*How pitiful!*

*I have **Dragon and Tiger** within,*
*Not the liver’s **Green Dragon***
*Nor the lung’s **White Tiger**—*
*These arise from water and fire.*

**Master Chunyang** said:
*"Only after hearing Master Cuī Zǐ’s name—Xīfàn—*
*Did I know of **Dragon-Yang** and **Tiger-Yin**:*
*Dragon-Yang emerges from **Lí (Fire),**
*Tiger-Yin from **Kǎn (Water).**
*Their union is the Dao’s foundation.*
*Why so?*
*When the Five Phases move disorderly,*
*The Tiger is born in water;*
*When the Five Phases reverse,*
*The Dragon emerges from fire.*

*The Dragon—*
*The heart’s essence-fluid,*
*The pure yang’s breath;*
*The Tiger—*
*The kidney’s **True One** water.*

*This is called the **Mysterious within the Mysterious**.*
*The refined essence of true yin and yang,*
*In others, it begets man;*
*In oneself, it begets spirit.*

*The heart’s fire is no imagined qi,*
*No false breath of inhalation.*
*I have three true fires:*
*The heart—**Jūn (Sovereign) Fire**, named **Upper Darkness**;*
*The kidneys—**Chén (Subject) Fire**, named **Middle Darkness**;*
*The bladder—**Mín (Commoner) Fire**, named **Lower Darkness**.*
*Concentrated, they become fire;*
*Dispersed, they become qi.*
*Rising and falling in cycle,*
*They complete the **Microcosmic Orbit**—*
*Two hundred sixty measures,*
*The degree of the **Small Heavenly Cycle**.*

*Heaven’s qi increases every five days—*
*The qi’s rhythm;*
*My cultivation—five counts advance,*
*One count retreats—*
*The fire’s rhythm.*

**Master Chunyang** said:
*"Nourish with fire the **Yellow Grandmother**."*
*The **Yellow Grandmother**—*
*The residual qi of spleen and stomach.*

**Hǎichán Zǐ** said:
*"The fire spirit must not be made to fly."*

*The **Golden Crystal**—*
*The refined essence of the lung,*
*Transmitted to the kidneys,*
*Transformation incomplete,*
*Sent to the **Mud Pillow Palace**,*
*Thus called **flying golden crystal behind the elbow**.*

*The **Returned Elixir***
*Is neither substance nor form—*
*The **Three Fields’ elixir**.*
*Returned—*
*Having gone and yet returning.*
*The **Three Fields**—*
*Where qi is born.*
*Qi is stored in the **Middle Field** and begets spirit,*
*Spirit is stored in the **Upper Field**—*
*Once stored, it must not be lost.*

*If fire’s rhythm spans three hundred days without error,*
*The inner elixir is complete,*
*Pure yang is born,*
*Refining the five viscera,*
*Thus the five qi become spirit and ascend to immortality—*
*Why cling to **Returned Elixir***
*To merely solidify the form?*
*The **Returned Elixir** solidifies the form,*
*Yet even this has its limits.*

*When wood is fully consumed,*
*It becomes charcoal,*
*With a lifespan of a hundred years;*

「The earth, when fully refined, becomes brick,
Brick’s lifespan spans a thousand years—
Yet tiles are merely for mortals!

To attain the Dao of the True Immortal,
One must persist in cultivation without ceasing,
Then may enter the Great Dao,
Refining *qi* to form spirit.

Now, those who seek inner observation to kindle fire and gather spirit,
Must first have the elixir—
Without it, they only indulge in vain imaginings.

When refining spirit to merge with the Dao,
The Dao is already complete—
Then, in stillness, one silently contemplates,
And vital essence surges from the heart’s depths.
With sufficient counting, one naturally abandons the mortal body
And ascends.

Fire refines the elixir—
When fire arrives, the elixir congeals.
To refine *qi*, when fire arrives, spirit manifests its form.
With ample fire and spirit’s potency,
Spirit naturally unites with the Dao’s truth,
Soaring within stillness as if in flight.

When spirit merges with the Dao’s completion,
Suddenly it transforms into a fire-dragon,
Ascending through the Heavenly Gate—
Beginning with a step or two,
Then progressing to three *li* or five *li*.

To enter and never exit—
One’s form and spirit both attain perfection.
To exit and never return—
One abandons substance and ascends to immortality.

Yet, to adjust spirit and emerge from the shell has its efficacy—
But do not rely on the body.
To enter and never exit,
Roaming and returning in cycles,
Transmitting the Dao and guiding others,
With both practice and merit fulfilled,
Then one enters the *Tongtian*—
The *Return to Root* chapter,
A book of Heavenly Concealment,
Rooted in rationality.

To preserve the elixir field well,
And return to the Root of Life—
Master Zhengyi, upon receiving the *Heavenly Concealment* text,
Read it for three years and attained enlightenment,
Then cultivated for three more years until body and mind were at ease.

After yet another three years,
The *Heavenly Concealment* Master instructed him on the essence of contemplation,
And only then did he grasp the wonder of *Return to Root*.

Master Zhengyi said:
*"A person’s root lies in the elixir field,
And if one can restore it, longevity follows—
Thus it is called *Return to Root* and *Restore the Vital Essence*."*

Observe the soul’s awareness—
It originates from rationality.
When rationality is perfected,
One attains the wondrous myriad transformations without end—
Thus it is called *Perfecting Nature* and *Myriad Wonders*.

I know that breathing is sustained by *qi*—
Thus there is the method of exhalation and inhalation;
Saliva is born from water’s storage—
Thus there is the technique of swallowing and spitting;
Thoughts arise from the heart’s perception—
Thus there are the keys to contemplation.

As for the *Nourishing* and *Defensive* circuits of blood and *qi*,
When awake, they course through the outer body;
When asleep, they circulate within.
Awake and asleep, inner and outer,
Mutually nurture each other—
Only then can harmony be achieved.

From the hour of *zi* to *wu*,
First harmonize the exterior,
Stretching and relaxing the four limbs,
Then rising to guide and lead,
Adjusting one’s breath until it steadies.
Then, one taps the small molar at the *Dantian* with a light hum,
Followed by tapping the large molar with a deep hum,
Rubbing one’s face with both hands,
Waiting until warmth permeates the ears and eyes.

Then, seated cross-legged, one rolls the tongue in the *Huachi* pool,
Waiting for saliva to arise and rinsing it,
Silently counting its drops—
When reaching three hundred, one swallows it.
Each time swallowing,
One must first inhale deeply, then swallow,
And upon completion, inhale again—
Thus, all inhaled and swallowed flows smoothly into the *Dantian*.

From *zi* to *wu*,
After food is digested and the mind is empty,
One may rinse and swallow without counting—
When the intention is exhausted, one stops.

Thus, five days constitute one *hou* (cycle),
Burning incense in a quiet chamber,
Contemplating one’s body—
From head to foot,
From foot to *Dantian*,
And upward along the spine’s meridian,
Entering the *Nihuan*—
The imagined yellow *qi* swirls like clouds,
Piercing straight through the *Nihuan*.

After contemplation, one rinses and swallows again,
Then covers the ears with both hands,
Taps the forehead like a drum—
Three times seven—
Stretches both feet,
Sits upright with head tilted,
Straining mightily to straighten the neck,
Both hands clenched firmly,
Crossed beneath the ribs,
Adjacent to the *Yao Mei* bone,
Then lifting both shoulders,
Holding the breath for a moment,
Waiting until *qi* fills the face and turns it crimson—
Then one ceases.

Practice this seven times,
And *qi* will ascend from the spine,
Piercing through to the *Nihuan*.

This is the grand outline of cultivation.
Yet there are also essential subtleties.

My *qi* should harmonize with the true *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
And move in unison with them.
I can recognize *qi*’s arrival,
Discern its path—
Then I may endure alongside Heaven and Earth.

Its method begins at *Winter Solstice*, the hour of *zi*,
When pure yang first emerges—
Slow or swift, one waits for its coming,
Then moves one’s own *qi* in accordance,
Aligning with Heaven and Earth’s *qi* as they awaken.
The next day, one again observes this *qi*,
Tracking its ebb and flow—
This is the most refined Dao of the Immortals.

For three hundred and sixty days,
One cultivates *qi* to merge with true *qi*.
When its practice reaches two or three,
The body grows ever clearer and gentler—
With prolonged practice, immortality is not difficult to attain.

The *Hong Meng* chapter:
The utmost spirit has no form,
The utmost Dao has no substance.
Embrace simplicity, guard stillness,
And fully align with principle.

The *Hong Meng* Master Zhang Wumeng,
With the courtesy name *Lingyin*,
Concealed himself at Tian Tai—
The True Emperor said:
*"A nation is like the heart—
When the heart is without action, *qi* harmonizes,
And when *qi* harmonizes, all treasures coalesce;
When the heart acts, *qi* is disordered,
And when *qi* is disordered, brilliance dissipates."*

Those who wander through the *Mystic Feminine*’s gate,
And seek the *Red Water*’s pearl,
Must first release the boundless gaze of Heaven,
Confine a thousand evils,
Sever all discordance—
Then return to embracing simplicity and guarding stillness,
Stillness within stillness,
Until reaching the utmost unity.

Unity is the Dao’s function,
The Dao is unity’s essence.
Unity and the Dao,
Are naturally so—
Thus the utmost spirit has no form,
The utmost Dao has no substance,
Without action yet achieving all things,
This aligns with principle.

Therefore, those who attain its Dao,
Witness the marvels of creation,
And the mysteries of spirits and gods—
And nothing escapes their transformation.

The dung beetle transforms into a cicada,
Rotten grass into fireflies,
Sparrows diving into water become clams,
Partridges diving into water become *shen* (illusions),
Field mice transform into horses,
Fish into dragons—
These are its lesser wonders.

The greater marvels,
Are that humans may become Immortals.»

「I have often observed the transformations of Heaven and Earth,
The luxuriant growth of grasses and trees,
The winds and clouds gathering and dispersing,
The sun and moon revolving in their courses,
The interplay of water and fire,
The friction of yin and yang—
Gazing upward and downward in contemplation.

From distant sources and nearby forms,
I gathered the *Huan Yuan* [還元] *Shi* [詩] *Bai Pian* [百篇], extracting its twelve essential verses.

The first verse reads:
*"At the beginning, the hidden Dragon faces a single yang,
Its clear transformations lie within the Central Yellow."*

When the Great *Lü* [吕] begins to blow the Heavenly Fire,
How dare I witness the *Luó* [萝] *Bīn* [宾] walking upon the Earth’s Frost?
The *Kūn* [坤] Mother, if she comes to subdue,
The *Zhèn* [震] Son dares not let his wildness run amok.

The Secret Master of the Dao once spoke,
Recognizing the Golden Elixir hidden within the waters of the Way.

The second verse reads:
*"One cycle returns to search the Jade above Kunlun,
Treading the Mysterious Pass through the Gates of Marvels."*

The Hundred Valleys bow to the Sovereign of the Azure Sea,
The Nine Heavens’ stars reverence the Purple Emperor.
The Wheel of Time and Moon, the Struggle of Yin and Yang,
The Movement of the Celestial Globe—roots of Creation.
Day and night revolve in their endless return,
Thus the infant’s life is everlasting.

The third verse reads:
*"Yesterday’s maiden opened the Spirit Gate,
And indeed saw the Celestial Assembly at the Purple Emperor’s Hall.*
The entire court of stars encircled her,
The twin wheels of sun and moon flew to and fro.
The resonant drums of Heaven echoed through the void,
The radiant golden blossoms lit the earth with brilliance.
After meeting the True Masters of the Three Caverns,
The Jade Emperor granted robes of six *zhū* [铢] weight.*

The fourth verse reads:
*"The Old Master opened the Gates of Marvels with clarity,
His opening and closing respond to Heaven and Earth.*
Where the *wàngxiàng* [罔象] has no form,
There lies the root of eternal life and deathlessness.
Diligently practicing in secret, the spirits rejoice,
Continuously refining, life is everlasting.
Thus, one attains the realm of carefree liberation,
And secures blessings for oneself and descendants.*

The fifth verse reads:
*"The Primordial Sovereign sits enthroned in the Mysterious Capital,
The Threefold Embryonic Dao dances at the Eight Corners.*
The treasure hall is entirely paved with jade,
The pearl chambers are half-draped with true pearls.
Mountains and rivers remain motionless, concealing the Mysterious Cauldron,
The sun and moon shift, entering the Small Flask.
When the One Yang transforms, Heaven and Earth move,
And thus the Great Peace arises from this wondrous technique.*

The sixth verse reads:
*"Within one pearl, the world unfolds vast,
The self-same Spirit Treasure, the self-same Vision.*
In the boundless depths, the Three Realms converge,
In the fleeting haze, ten thousand transformations rest.
Yin ghosts know not the Azure Sea’s depths,
The Fire Dragon departs to the upper clod of earth.
The virtuous refine this profound mystery,
The Celestial Lord grants them office in the Jade Realm.*

The seventh verse reads:
*"The self-same spirit-*qi* and the self-same body,
Why seek answers from those trifling outsiders?
This mortal form, when united, is all illusion,
Only through cultivation does it become true.*
Years pass swiftly as peaches ripen,
Calamities dissolve like sea into dust.
Seek the Path of the Elixir Field in Heaven above,
Lest you grow old and merely follow convention.*

The eighth verse reads:
*"Alone in the empty mountain, I sit at ease,
For attaining the Dao, I gladly return to seclusion.*
The yellow-haired old man opens the Earthly Gate,
The snow-clad maiden guards the Heavenly Pass.
The divine waters are brewed in three-tiered cauldrons,
The Mysterious Pearls are played with in winding channels.
Ask not of my household’s mundane affairs,
For I distill one essence to heal my withering visage.*

The ninth verse reads:
*"The West’s *Gēng* [庚] binds armor with the Tiger and Dragon,
These two never before seen in harmony.*
Heaven and Earth are paired as husband and wife,
The firm and yielding unite as the *Kǎn-Lí* [坎离] Palaces.
Clouds and thunder transform in myriad forms,
Water and fire surge in twelve layers.
This technique of non-action requires no inquiry,
A single lotus blooms white in the Jade Pool.*

The tenth verse reads:
*"Within the twelve hours, the Child stands first,
Drawing and adding in motion without pause.*
The laws of form turn from the South,
The boundless divine waters flow toward the North.
The *Chá* [诧] maiden captures the Crow in the Vermilion Chamber,
The infant drives the Hare to the Pearl Tower.
Only by guarding the One does one contain the Primordial *Qi*,
Do not ask of the *Cāng-Qí* [沧淇] how many autumns pass.*

The eleventh verse reads:
*"The Dao lies within the Elixir Field for those who reach it,
Clearly understood—what more doubt remains?
The *Qián* [乾] Son chases the Dragon into the hidden *Kǎn* [坎],
The *Kūn* [坤] Daughter follows the Tiger into the concealed *Lí* [离].
Only by guarding the Pure and the Void does one abandon desires,
Thus naturally attaining serenity and the state of *Xīqí* [希夷].
The Daoist scriptures are no idle words,
Observe the thousand-year embryo breathing like the tortoise.*

The twelfth verse reads:
*"Emerging from the red dust, hidden in the Cavern of Heaven,
The Five Clouds pile around the field where the *zhī* [芝] grows.*
The Spirit Tortoise drinks from the Flowering Pool’s waters,
The Mysterious Leopard hides within the jade valleys’ mist.
What need for buying moonlit breezes and clear winds?
The Jade Needle and Golden Hoop are used at leisure.
Time and again, I mend the coarse sack,
Collecting the *Huan Yuan* [还元] essence of the hundred verses.*

**呼吸篇 [Hūxī Piān] (Chapter on Breathing):**
The spleen dwells in the center; breathing is its function.
The marvel of the True Person lies in his breath with the heels.

The utmost wanderer says:
*"Day and night, a hundred moments [刻],
One moment equals one hundred thirty-five breaths,
Thus day and night total thirteen thousand five hundred breaths.
When the sun rises and the *fāng* [方] is bound,
The pulse completes one cycle and returns to its beginning,
Hence, breathing four times—from the extremities to the center—
Completes one breath."*

Students call breath *"qi"* [气], and *"qi"* is life.
The True Person’s breath is with his heels—why so?
This is because it values the profound.

*Biān* [扁] *Quē* [鹊] says:
*"Exhale from the heart and lungs,
Inhale into the kidneys and liver,
While the spleen dwells in the center.
Thus, within the breath, the Five Phases are complete."*

I have heard *Fán* [樊] *Dà* [大] *Jūn* [君] say (in the *Yuan Dao Jing* [元道经]):
*"To restore the Primordial *Qi*,
One must always reduce breathing as a sign.
The heart’s source is calm and clear,
Its breath naturally diminishes.
Thus, from reducing breath to breathlessness,
And from breathlessness to steady breath.
Steady is the unforced, unobstructed stillness of non-action.
Then, restoring the Primordial and returning to the roots,
One may dwell in the world.*

The common man regards having breath as normal,
The sage regards having no breath as normal.
Movement brings breath,
Stillness brings no breath;
Breath and no breath,
Enter and exit freely.
Thus, having breath is delusion,
Its essence lies in careful repose.

Hence, there are three responses:
The first response—
Then for a hundred days, whether in action or repose, all is well,
For the Primordial *Qi* gradually restores,
Worldly concerns daily diminish,
The void and tranquility daily increase;»

其二应，
Then for two hundred days, the *Qi* naturally ceases in a state of tranquil stillness,
This marks the *Primordial Qi* nearing stabilization,
One abstains from grains and cereals,
And from the five flavors;
Hunger and thirst do not arise.

其三应，
Then for three hundred days, one abides motionless and serene in stillness,
This is the *Primordial Qi* returning to its roots,
Hunger and thirst never come,
Cold and heat do not intrude,
One’s lifespan aligns with the heavens and the earth.

夫减息住气，
Both reducing breath and dwelling in *Qi* are successful when one attains breathlessness and stabilized *Qi*.

若独行减息，
But if one practices only reducing breath,
Then its efficacy will be slow.

则其功迟矣，
专行住气，
Yet if one practices only dwelling in *Qi*,
Then it will be difficult to reach breathlessness.

若夫开通百关，
However, if one opens and harmonizes the hundred *passages* (关),
And combines it with reducing breath,
Then the *Primordial Qi* becomes abundant and full,
And its efficacy is doubled.

或问曰：
Someone asked:
谨其休止，
How does careful repose proceed?
亦有渐乎？
Does it also advance by stages?

曰：
It does. Its stages are nineteen:
日不减息，
On days when breath is not reduced,
Reduce by twenty-five days,
This is dwelling in fifty minor breaths.

曰小乏，
When minor fatigue arises,
Reduce by three days and five major breaths.

曰大乏，
When major fatigue arises,
Eliminate for sixty days and thirty major breaths.

曰小醉，
When minor intoxication arises,
Reduce by ten days.

曰大醉，
When major intoxication arises,
Reduce by a hundred days and combine with vomiting to eliminate one week’s worth of breath.

曰欲，
When lust arises,
Daily reduce by fifty days.

曰怒，
When wrath arises,
Daily reduce by fifty days.

曰惊，
When startled,
曰忿，
When resentful,
曰欢，
When joyful,
曰及，
When greedy,
Each reduces by ten days.

曰惧，
When fearful,
Reduce by seven days.

曰劳，
When labored,
曰倦，
When weary,
曰躁，
When restless,
曰烦，
When vexed,
曰饥，
When hungry,
All reduce by five days.

曰饱，
When sated,
Dwell in three days of good fortune.

与夫饮食触犯，
As for dietary transgressions,
寒热过差，
Excessive cold or heat,
风湿所及，
Wind-dampness affecting the body,
起居失节，
Disordered daily routines,
言语散杂，
Erratic speech,
思虑烦多，
Excessive mental strain,
These all diminish the *Primordial Qi*.

夫人受天地之气，
For humans receive the *Qi* of heaven and earth,
故呼吸出入与天地相通，
Thus, inhalation and exhalation harmonize with the *Qi* of heaven and earth,
是以通彻则生，
Hence, when the *Qi* flows freely, life thrives,
壅滞则死。
When it stagnates, death ensues.

呼者出气也，
Exhalation is the release of *Qi*,
受气於五脏六腑，
The *Qi* is drawn from the five *zàng* organs and six *fǔ* entrails,
呼出其脏腑之气归於天地。
Exhalation sends forth the *Qi* of the organs and entrails back to heaven and earth.

是以一呼出气，
Thus, with one exhalation,
其脉上行三寸而出，
The pulse ascends three inches before the *Qi* is expelled,
即以口吐旧气，
And one spits out the old *Qi* through the mouth,
以受新气焉。
To receive the fresh *Qi*.

吸者入气也，
Inhalation is the intake of *Qi*,
吸敛天地之气归於脏腑。
It draws in the *Qi* of heaven and earth to nourish the organs and entrails.

是以一吸入气，
Thus, with one inhalation,
其脉下行三寸，
The pulse descends three inches,
逐其脏府之宿气焉。
Driving out the lingering *Qi* of the organs and entrails.

呼吸不等，
If inhalation and exhalation are unequal,
失天地之调气，
Then one disrupts the harmonized *Qi* of heaven and earth,
其所以生疾者乎。
This is how illnesses arise.

樊大君之论，
The discourse of Master Fan is indeed profound.

枕中篇
*Chapter on Resting in Bed:*
空窍不守，
If the empty cavities are not maintained,
邪乃为灾；
Then pernicious *Qi* will bring calamity.

精神内存，
When the spirit is preserved within,

How can illness arise?

孙真人名思邈曰：

其要在乎和心损虑、
The essentials lie in harmonizing the heart and reducing concerns,
去喜怒、
Eliminating joy and anger,
除驰逐、
Removing reckless pursuit,
谨施泄，
Carefully managing excretion,
秋冬尤当固藏者也。
Especially in autumn and winter, one must firmly preserve.

若或有疾，
If illness arises,
则返舌塞喉，
Then reverse the tongue and block the throat,
漱液咽津唾也，
Gargle with saliva, swallow the *essence*, and spit out the *phlegm*,
瞑目内视，
Close the eyes and gaze inward,
使心生火，
Causing the heart to generate *fire*,
想其疾之所在，
Visualize the location of the illness,
以火攻之疾则愈矣。
And attack it with *fire*—then the illness will be cured.

甲子、甲寅、庚申八节晦朔当燕居独处，
During the eight *critical days* of *jiǎzǐ, jiǎyín, gēngshēn*—the days of solstices, equinoxes, and new moons—
冥心专精，
One should seclude oneself, quiet the mind, and focus the spirit,
以去其欲。
To eliminate desire.

日在亥子，
On days corresponding to *hài* and *zǐ*,
勿弃唾，
Do not discard saliva,

Do not lose *essence*,
勿失气，
Do not lose *Qi*,
入山未至百步而却行，
Before entering a mountain, retreat a hundred steps,
却行百步，
Then retreat another hundred steps,
然后登山，
Only then ascend the mountain,
众邪伏矣，
For all pernicious *Qi* will be subdued,
百毒匿矣。
And all toxins will be concealed.

导引者当以左右手摩其尺宅，
Those practicing *Dao-Yin* should rub their wrists with both hands,
使之极热则有光泽，
Until they become intensely warm and radiant,
行之五年，
Practice for five years,
色如孺子。
Then their complexion will be like that of a child.

蚤起平气正坐，
Awaken early to balance the *Qi*, sit upright,
先叉手掩颈，
First cross the hands over the neck,
仰首视天，
Raise the head and gaze at the sky,
颈与手争力为之，
Straining the neck against the hands,
可以使精和血通，
This will make the *essence* and blood circulate,
风气不入矣。
And prevent pernicious *Qi* from entering.

屈动其体，
Bend and move the body,
反张其四支，
Stretch and extend the four limbs,
宣摇其百关，
Ventilate and sway the hundred *passages*,
周匝皆热，
Until warmth pervades all,

The Dao of the Immortal has three aspects:
日保精、
Daily preserving *essence*,
日行气、
Daily circulating *Qi*,
日服饵，
Daily taking elixirs,
皆由浅以至深者也，
All progress from shallow to profound,
其大要在乎胎息而已。
The greatest essential lies in *Tāixī*—breathing within the embryo.

胎息者，
*Tāixī*—breathing within the embryo—
不以口鼻呼吸者也。
Is the method of not inhaling and exhaling through the mouth and nose.

夫善用气者，
Those skilled in *Qi*-use,
其嘘也，
Their exhalations,
水为逆流焉，
Cause water to flow backward,
火为灭焉，
Extinguish fire,
猛惊为隐伏焉，
Conceal sudden fright,
疡肿为消焉。
And dissolve tumors and swellings.

If illness suddenly arises, one should swallow three times nine,
可以差矣。
This can alleviate it.

行气之法，

处於密室，
Is to be in a secluded chamber,
暝目闭息，
Close the eyes and stop the breath,
置鸿毛於口鼻之上，

使之不动可也。
Ensuring it does not move.

於是耳无闻、

目无视、
The eyes see nothing,
心无思，
The mind thinks nothing,
以渐除之而已。
Gradually eliminating these distractions.

夜或有悸，
If at night one experiences palpitations,
则存日月入於明堂，
Then visualize the sun and moon entering the *Bright Hall* (明堂),

内想篇
*Chapter on Inner Visualization:*
涓子得道，
*Qiānzǐ*, having attained the Dao,
以授苏林；
Passed it on to *Sū Lín*;
存三守一，
Preserving the three and holding to the one,
自得於心。
He himself found it within his mind.

涓子曰：
*Qiānzǐ* said:
立人之道，
The Dao of establishing humanity,
其身如栓桔焉，
Is like the *Qiánjǔ*—a wooden plug in a well—
其情如赘疣焉。
And one’s emotions are like warts.

知其然也，
Knowing this to be true,
故为修养之方。
Thus, he formulated methods of cultivation and nourishment.

皆小道也，
These are all minor methods—
彼吐纳咽漱按摩采取云者，
Such as exhaling and inhaling, swallowing and gargling, pressing and massaging, and gathering *Qi*—

古先至人，
The ancient Sage-Kings,
返老还童，
Reversed aging and restored youth,
太一含真，
The *Tàiyī* embraced the *True*,
盖有至要焉。
They possessed the most profound essentials.

吾尝炼神育胎而行内想之法而已。
I have practiced refining the spirit, nurturing the embryo, and employing the method of inner visualization.

安坐於静室而冥心焉，
Sit quietly in a still chamber and quiet the mind,
以左股加右股之上，
Place the left thigh over the right,
左右手俱下，
And let both hands hang down,
虚其身如三足之鼎，
Emptying the body like a three-legged cauldron,
於是想其左肾为日，
Then visualize the left kidney as the sun,
右肾为月，
And the right kidney as the moon,
日中出白气，
From the sun, white *Qi* emerges,
入於精海之内，
Entering the *Sea of Essence* within,
变而为赤矣；
Transforming into red.

From the moon, red *Qi* emerges,
Entering the *Sea of Essence* within,
Transforming into white.

The two *Qi* intermingle,
Condensing into true *Qi*,
And form an embryo—
Luminous as jade.

Observing my form,
Only in its initial stage does it resemble me,
Like an egg in appearance.

All limbs complete,
Gradually nurtured and growing,
Kneeling within the *Sea of Essence*,
Hands crossed before it,
Entering and exiting through the crown,
Separating from the body,
Roaming freely—
Thus escaping the fate of heaven and earth.

**Chapter Thirteen of *Dao Gun* Complete** *(Note: Original text had "Five," corrected to "Thirteen" per reconstructed edition.)*

**Chapter Fourteen of *Heart Mirror* by Master Youzi, Compiled by Zeng Can**

The Four Yellows and Eight Stones are not the true essence of medicine;
The Five Colors and Three Flowers transcend ordinary classification.

Master *Xuánhé* said:
*"When lead is true, the elixir forms—sacred and numinous.*
Thus, the ancient Sage-Kings spoke only of lead and mercury,
Never mentioning the Four Yellows and Eight Stones."

Lead and mercury—
When applied to the Five Phases,
Manifested through the Four Symbols,
They are the natural communion of yin and yang’s primal *Qi*,
Like how humans receive red and white *Qi* to form the embryonic *Qi*—
Sufficient, and one becomes enlightened;
Insufficient, and one becomes dull and stunted.

Thus, one must not fail to understand *Long* (Dragon) and *Hǔ* (Tiger).

*Hǔ* is silver,
Contained within lead—
Thus it is water, it is metal.

*Long* is mercury,
The *Zhuó* (intriguing female), it is wood, it is fire.
Metal arises from water,
Water is born of wood,
Wood is born of fire,
Fire gives rise to earth—
The *Way* lies within this.

Lead contains the Five Colors,
Mercury emits the Three Flowers.
When these two substances unite,
Their name is called the *River Vehicle*!

The likes of *Wei Boyang* composed *The Parametric Contract*
To speak of the *Great Transformation*,
Sequentially drawing upon the Five Phases,
Unfolding the mechanisms of heaven and earth,
To illuminate the *Way* of Great Return.
Its meaning is profound and difficult to grasp,
Thus scholars cannot fully comprehend lead and mercury.

To know lead and mercury but not the fire’s timing,
To know the fire’s timing but not the crucible and tripod,
To know the crucible and tripod but not the ebb and flow of ascent and descent—
This is not speaking of the *Way*.

The heart is the source of the elixir.
If the heart does not align with the *Way*,
Even if one grasps the deepest mysteries,
I have not seen one who could succeed.

*The Parametric Contract* says:
*"Plant grain with millet,
Embrace the parrot to cover the egg—*
This speaks of how what is not of the same kind struggles to produce."

Master *Táo Zhēn* said:
*"Sand is born from mercury,
Metal from lead—*
This clearly shows that their kinds do not intermingle."

It is said:
*"Mercury gives birth to water, silver dies;
Lead, constrained, gives birth to spirit-sprouts—*
This reasoning is profound."

What is *Returning the Elixir*?
It is to contain fire without losing its original nature.

*Nine Transformations*—
Nine changes of lead’s *Qi*,
Not nine refinements.

Thus, the supreme medicine
Is formed when yin and yang transform into *Qi*,
Not by subduing *yùshí* (ore), *quèshā* (arsenic sulfide), or *liúhuáng* (sulfur) to force it.

If one forces substances of unlike kinds upon it,
Their poison is sufficient to harm life.

The foolish subdue mercury with medicine,
Forcing it to contain fire and die—
This is erroneous.

Thus it is said:
*"True lead does not change color,
True mercury possesses divine power.*
Without the refined *Qi* of true lead,
How could one ever complete the elixir?

Thus, black lead enters the fire,
And becomes only ash and dross.
Who understands the subtlety of *Returning the Elixir*?
It lies in the *Three-One*.

The unrefined *Long* and *Hǔ*,
The essence of heaven and earth—
They do not rely on medicine,
But on the Five Phases—
This is the teaching of the Sage-Kings.

Mercury is the essence of the *Tàiyáng*,
The true *Qi* of the South,
Obtaining yin and yang, water and fire to govern its transformations,
Thus it resides at the head of the *Qīngdì* (Green Emperor),
As the essence of wood,
And thus wood generates fire,
Naturally containing the most refined medicine.

Lead is the essence of the North’s black water,
Its transformation into the West’s *Gēng-Xīn* metal,
Thus metal generates water,
Water generates wood—
These two substances align to form the divine elixir.

In ancient times, *Liú Xuánmù* served *Wei Boyang*,
Doubted and withdrew in regret, dying young.
*Xú Jǐngxiū*, through unremitting effort,
Encountered a master who taught him the Golden Elixir,
And dwelled upon *Tàibái* Mountain for over a thousand years—
The difference between belief and disbelief.

In recent times, *Xiè Chōngxuán* and *Sū Dān*
Both consumed the Golden Elixir and became immortals—
This is the efficacy of the Golden Elixir.

*The Parametric Contract* says:
*"Gold takes sand as its master,
Harmonizing with mercury,
Its transformations depend on its truth—*
Truth is *Qi*.
Beginning and end mutually engender each other.

Not using medicine but the Five Phases—
Heaven’s teeth naturally form,
The body of the white horse’s teeth is true,
*Dānshā* (cinnabar) and *Mǎoyǒu* (arsenic) are the two families harmonized.

The *Huánán* School refines autumn stone,
The Yellow Emperor admires *Jīnhuá* (golden flower).
Yellow sprouts are not lead,
Lead is not true *dānshā*.

Refining with contained fire completes one cycle,
After nine transformations,
The golden flower naturally forms.

White medicine, red spirit-mercury,
Autumn stone shares their nature.

Lonely yin cannot transform alone,
Scanty yang cannot complete the work.
Originally pure and still,
It inherently possesses transformative, numinous power.

When *Long* and *Hǔ* meet,
How could they ever fail to recognize each other?
White liquid devours in unity,
Becoming both husband and wife.
Transforming into golden sprouts,
They follow the *Hòutǔ* (Later Soil) in due time.

If one understands the *Purple River Vehicle*,
One naturally ascends to the celestial realms.

Do not refine withered lead and mercury,
Wasting effort like dust in the wind.

Heaven, earth, sun, and moon—
Numinous beings are called *Jīngōng* (Metal Lord).
*Jīngōng* is not lead,
It must be concealed within lead.

White liquid in the furnace’s fire,
Golden sprouts gradually form.
Recall the day you first met—
Difficult to find mercury’s form.
At the peak of yang, yin-fire arises,
Fire wanes as yang-*Qi* merges.
It naturally transforms into the *Purple River Vehicle*—
Consuming it grants eternal life.

「Thus, in the first month, the white liquid congeals like snow;
In the second month, it solidifies into fat-like substances;
By the third month, half its form is united with the flower, like a pendant pearl;
In the fourth month, the two substances embrace, resembling a single drop of blood.

In the fifth month, it ascends and clings to its mother, its sound like a sob;
In the sixth month, it reaches the Purple Palace, its breath nearly extinguished;
In the seventh month, it rides the yin and absorbs qi, its limbs now drawn;
In the eighth month, it nearly completes its form, its organs and entrails contained within congealed blood;
In the ninth month, it leaves behind a crimson skin while growing hair;
In the tenth month, child and mother separate—
The mother is exhausted, the child is whole—
Its appearance shifts to that of white snow,
And it must then be nurtured in the furnace.

Thus it is said:
Yang arises from *Fù* (复, Recovery),
Yin arises from *Gòu* (遘, Encounter).
The furnace is entrusted to the center,
The *Hòutǔ* (Later Soil) to the *Wù* (戊, Fifth Heavenly Stem).
The *Dǐng* (鼎, Cauldron) moves above and below in mutual succession,
Guarding the substance so it does not disperse or vanish.
Do not lose sight of it,
For seasons and times are fixed—
When the Dragon and Tiger rush to meet,
Yang reaches its peak at *Qián* (乾, Heaven),
Yin reaches its peak at *Kūn* (坤, Earth),
The Four Symbols must be divided,
And the sixty-four *Guà* (卦, Hexagrams) cycle within the central reverence.

The Dragon and Tiger intermingle and devour each other,
The Five Phases (*Wǔxíng*) establish their positions within.
Water and fire serve as mediators, refining my spirit;
Yin and yang nurture my luminous dawn and dusk.
The Eight Nodes shift with cold and warmth,
And thus it gradually transforms into golden sprouts.
The sun and moon urge it forward, evoking the mother’s favor,
From which it solidifies and establishes its foundation.
Thousands of autumns, tens of millennia—
It births descendants of longevity.
This is the profound mystery of the *Cāntóng Qì* (参同契, *The Concordant of the Three*).

*Xuán Hé Zǐ* (玄和子) says:
I possess the secret of the *Dǐng Lǔ* (鼎卤, Cauldron and Brine).

Brine is the furnace.
The *Dǐng Lǔ* are the symbols of Heaven and Earth,
Their spirit resides in the Three and Five alone.
Below is the Vermilion Bird (*Zhūquè*),
Above is the Dark Tortoise (*Xuánwǔ*),
Between them lies the division of Heaven and Earth—
This is the law of yin and yang.

Yang is born from *Fù* (复, Recovery),
And completes its nine revolutions at *Qián* (乾, Heaven).
Yin emerges from *Gòu* (遘, Encounter),
For water flows from below.
Fire flourishes and invades yin,
Yang wanes and returns to soil.
If one does not understand this,
How can one subdue the Dragon and Tiger?

The two *qì* (气) are *Zǐ* (子, Child) and *Wǔ* (午, Noon).
One suppresses to control the other’s ascent,
Thus below is the Red Dragon,
And the Wooden Green Three-Flowered Mother (*Sānhuā Lǎonǚ*).
This is the Great Medicine below.

Above is the Dark Tortoise (*Xuánwǔ*),
With divine symbols: the White Tiger, the *Huápó* (华池, Glorious Pool) Mirror of Yellow Heaven,
The *Jīngōng* (Metal Lord) in its watery position.
The Red Dragon comes from lead,
The Black Tiger comes from mercury.

Following the hexagrams to harmonize with yin and yang,
By the tenth month, it will shed its shell.
Thus, one knows that to transmute gold, gold must be present,
And to transform soil, soil must be present.
The existence of the *Jīndān* (金丹, Golden Elixir) lies in the divine water of the Glorious Pool,
And the secrets of the Great Elixir are no more than those in the *Cāntóng Qì* (参同契).

The ancient song says:
White mercury generates cinnabar,
Black lead generates golden sprouts.
Within it, the number nine is repeated nine times,
Nine transformations yield the Three-Flowered Mother.
When refined to the Purple Yang Palace (*Zǐyánggōng*),
Yellow gold cannot be boasted of—
Only when the *Jīngōng* (Metal Lord) unites with true mercury,
Can one refine the golden liquid into *Zǐlíngshā* (紫灵砂, Purple Spirit Sand).

*Xuán Hé Zǐ* says:
When using lead, do not allow lead to dwell within mercury.
Strain out all its dregs,
Then one may begin refining.
Temporarily, lead serves as its vessel.

Thus, the source of the Great Elixir
Does not depart from true lead, true mercury, divine symbols, and white snow.

Before taking the divine elixir,
Choose a day of the Eight Nodes (*Bājié*) and *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子, Heavenly Stem-Child) in conjunction.
First, abandon all intentional actions,
And cultivate the form of non-action.
Further, one must abstain from grains and regulate one’s breath,
Retaining vision and returning hearing,
And thus achieve *yǔhuà* (羽化, transcendence).

The song says:
Lead is originally the *Jīngōng* (Metal Lord),
The *Jīngōng* obtains lead and flourishes.
If the scholar abandons the *Jīngōng*,
The *Jīngōng* becomes crude.
The flowing pearl is the *Zhàinǚ* (诧女, Astonished Maiden),
With fire, it naturally ascends.
Suddenness is the *Jīngōng*’s control,
Their mutual affection is their shared destiny.
Together in movement, together in rest,
The whole day hides behind double doors.
Lead is the fixed mouth of the cauldron.
Still, it is transformed by yin and yang,
By fire both above and below.
Following its changes, it finds its foundation.
The two natures both return to soil,
The Three-Flowered Mother’s qi does not shift.
When it reaches the Purple Yang Palace,
It transforms together into yellow flowers.
Throughout the year, its hue remains purple radiance.
This is the name of true mercury,
How could it ever again ascend?

*Nǚwā* (女娲) refined the *Wǔdì Qì* (五帝气, Qi of the Five Emperors),
The essence of lead.
It transforms and supplements Heaven and Earth.
Thirty-six calculations reveal the world’s patterns,
Seventy-two stones mark their positions.
Seventy-two *liǎng* (两, ounces),
Thirty-six of lead.
Heaven obtains one and becomes complete,
Earth obtains one and becomes square,
Wood becomes charcoal and is not discarded.
The *Hèchē* (河车, Purple River Vehicle) is taken from lead,
The *Zhàinǚ* (诧女) is sought within mercury.
The *Tàiyǐ* (太乙, Supreme Unity) dispenses medicine for *Pángzǔ* (彭祖, Pengzu) to taste,
Firmly aiding the refined essence to become dense and compact.
One *wén* (文, principle) and one *wǔ* (武, force) often falter.
Below, the turtle spreads the great sea basin,
Within the furnace, the *Fúsāng* (扶桑, Azure Mulberry) is used sparingly.»

The purple vapor thick with emerald mists exhales a fragrant scent,
Shrimp, clam, and fish scales gleam with sunlight’s radiance.

To grasp how **Wèibó** (魏伯) ascends to the clouds and departs,
Do not emulate **Cháng'é** (嫦娥) hiding within the moon’s embrace.

The **Xuánhé** (玄和) principle at **Zǐ** (子) time is indeed natural,
Yet one must not neglect the **guàqì** (卦气, hexagramic *qi*) and fire’s proper measure.

**November**, the **Fù** (复) hexagram.
Its first *yáo* (爻, line) is a single *yáng* (阳, yang) emerging—
The herald of spring’s first stirrings.

At the hour of **Zǐ** (子), the *yúnfújié* (运符节, cyclical correspondences) align,
The **Tiānténg** (天呈, Heaven’s Manifestation) turns,
To ignite the fire—thus refining the **jīndǐng** (金鼎, golden furnace).
Purify your heart with fasting and stillness,
As though confronting the **Yùhuáng** (玉皇, Jade Emperor).
Within the furnace, the **Bái Hǔ** (白虎) and **Qīnglóng** (青龙) both reside.
The **Bái Hǔ** (White Tiger) restrains the **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon),
And only then does the **Qīnglóng** begin its spirited ascent.

**December**, the **Lín** (临) hexagram.
Two *yáng* (yang) lines arise—
The fire’s vigor grows, manifesting the **Chìlóng** (赤龙, Vermilion Dragon).

The **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon) ascends and descends,
Like rain in flight.

The furnace now takes the form of **Péngdǎo** (蓬岛, Penglai Isle).
Here, the phases of **tuìshuǐ jìn huǒ** (退水进火, receding water, advancing fire) occur.
The furnace has doors and vents;
**Qiánjiān** (潜肩, concealing the furnace’s opening) wards off the wind.
The key lies in knowing the **huìshuò** (晦朔, dark and bright phases) and the **qiánkūn** (乾坤, Heaven and Earth) numbers,
And harmonizing **lead and mercury**—
Only then may they enter the furnace.

Adjust the fire’s measure,
And success may be achieved.

**January**, the **Tài** (泰) hexagram.
Two *qi* (气, *qi*) forces now balance—
The **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon) in the furnace is pressed by three *yáng* (yang),
Its ascent grows fierce.

Within the furnace, the **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon) and **Bái Hǔ** (White Tiger) contend,
Devouring each other.
Listen to their roars—
If their sounds are like an infant’s cry, cease the fire’s ascent.
If the fire rages, unleash thunderous **wǔhuǒ** (武火, martial fire).
Thus, the **wǔhuǒ** (martial fire) is gradually employed.

When the hexagram reaches **Tài** (泰),
Spring’s season is complete.

Close the northern door of the furnace—
The **wǔhuǒ** (martial fire) blazes fiercely.
**February**, the **Dà Zhuàng** (大壮) hexagram alone.
Its lines mark the initial fire of summer—
The **wǔhuǒ** (martial fire) is now applied.
The *yīnyáng* (阴阳, yin-yang) *qi* follows its cyclical correspondences,
And the furnace booms like wind and thunder,
As **lead and mercury** surge within.

When the sound of dripping water and crackling fire is heard,
The **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon) is gradually subdued,
And the **dān** (丹, elixir) begins to form.

**March**, the **Yǎng** (央) hexagram.
Unless prolonged transformation leads to pure *yáng* (阳),
The fire’s force is intensified—
Thus, the **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon) and **Bái Hǔ** (White Tiger) are self-restrained.
On the furnace’s top, **zǐfěn** (紫粉, purple powder) appears,
And around its sides, **hóngfúyào** (红芙药, red peony medicine) glows.

**April**, the **Qián** (乾) hexagram.
With the six positions complete and yielding to *yáng* (阳),
This is the moment of the furnace’s blazing radiance.
Thus, the **wǔhuǒ** (martial fire) burns most fiercely—
The peak of the **dān** (丹, elixir) process,
When the **Bái Hǔ** (White Tiger) is fully consumed,
And the **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon) is utterly subdued.
Thunder and lightning cease,
The furnace stands empty and silent,
Inner and outer harmony achieved,
The sea’s waters all drained.
Treat it with utmost care—
For it is about to enter the **wǔ wèi nánfāng lí zhī jiǔ guān** (午位南方离之九官, ninth office of the south at the *wǔ* (午) position).

A verse sings:
*The Sage seizes the essence of creation’s art,*
*With hands that wrestle sun and moon within the furnace’s embrace.*
*Subtle vapors swirl—Heaven and Earth’s refined essence,*
*Piercing through yin and yang, guiding spirits and ghosts.*
*If the solar soul and lunar spirit can be recognized,*
*Then the knower is a child of the Immortals.*

*Refine and ingest it for a thousand days,*
*And the body, free from yin’s grasp, shall never die.*

This refers to the above.

**May**, the **Gòu** (遘) hexagram.
A single *yīn* (阴, yin) line first emerges—
The **dān** (丹, elixir) now, in its tranquil state,
The season of great peace.

The fire of the **Lí Guān** (离宫, office of *lí*),
With two realms in resonance yet unchanged.
Within the furnace, clouds and rain have ceased,
Its fragrance red and fresh,
Like spring’s gentle harmony.

From **November**, when *yáng* (阳) returns,
To **May**, when *yīn* (阴) once more prevails—
This is the natural cycle of **jiǔhuán qīfǎn** (九还七返, nine returns and seven revolutions).

**June**, the **Zhú** (逐) hexagram.
The *yīnfù* (阴父, yin father) gradually forms,
Returning to the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) position in the southwest,
Where fire absorbs **lead**—
This marks the onset of **qiū** (秋, autumn).
On the furnace’s top, the sea’s waters gather.
When entering *yīn* (阴), increase them;
When at the height of *yáng* (阳), decrease them.
Place a **kèlòu** (刻漏, water clock) in the room,
To measure the hours.

At this time, the **dān** (丹, elixir) is full within the furnace,
Its hue like crimson clouds.
With two *yīn* (阴) lines now formed,
The **Qīnglóng** (Green Dragon) and **Bái Hǔ** (White Tiger) have no cause for concern.

**July**, the **Pǐ** (否) hexagram.
Three *yáng* (阳) lines have retreated,
Returning once more to *yīn* (阴).
Thus, the **huángyá jiéhuā** (黄芽结花, yellow sprouts forming blossoms),
And the sea’s waters are halved in measure.

Yet within this single chamber,
The **Kūn** (坤, Earth) and **Qián** (乾, Heaven) forces are applied,
And the balance of creation is held—
When the **dān** (丹, elixir) is complete,
Like Heaven and Earth giving birth to myriad things.

**August**, the **Guān** (观) hexagram.
The **Mǎo-Yǒu** (卯酉) positions—
Where Heaven and Earth divide equally.
Thus, at the hour of **Yǒu** (酉),
The critical moment for extraction arrives.

**September**, the **Bì** (剥) hexagram.
Five *yīn* (阴) lines now prevail—
Thus, yin and yang are nearly complete.
The *yánghuǒ* (阳火, yang fire) gradually recedes,
The upper waters increase once more,
Clear and motionless—
The year’s end.

Who knows the **Dà Huán Dān** (大还丹, Great Return Elixir),
Which from nothingness generates existence,
Founded on the **One** (一),
Within the One, extracting the One,
Naturally forming?

**October**, the **Kūn** (坤) hexagram.
Its positions now complete,
Its fire has waned.
This is the moment of pure *yīn* (阴) solidifying.
Thus, pray to the **Yuándǒu** (元斗, Primordial Dipper),
And invoke the **Tàiqīu** (太丘, Great Mound)—
The stars of Heaven and Earth,
To safeguard the furnace,
Fearful of malevolent *qi* (气) intruding.
Wait until the **xīnghuǒ** (星火, stellar fire) naturally extinguishes,
And the furnace and vessel grow cold—
Then open them.

On the furnace’s top, **zǐfěn** (紫粉, purple powder) gleams bright—
This is the **Zǐyóu Dān** (紫游丹, Purple Wandering Elixir).

Why is the **sānwǔyī** (三五一, Three-Five-One) principle essential?
It is said:
The **Kǎn Guān** (坎宫, office of *kǎn*) has its master—
Named **Xuán Mǔ** (玄母, Mysterious Mother).
She harbors the **Qīnglóng** (青龙, Green Dragon),
The **Nánfāng Shǐzhě** (南方使者, Southern Envoy),
Capable of transformation and adaptation.
She takes **wood’s essence** in partial sacrifice,
To return it to the **Hòutǔ** (后土, Later Soil).
At the **Hùndùn** (混沌) time,
She pairs with the **Fūfù** (夫妇, consort).
When *yīn* (阴) is exhausted and pure *yáng* (阳) emerges,
Her treasure ascends—
Then it may be extracted.

The extraction has its proper time,
The taking has its appointed day.
Ingest it for three years,
And thus, it becomes steadfast—
The master of eternal life.

**Chapter on Embryonic Breathing**

Soft and lingering, like a presence sustained,
It governs the **yuánqì** (元气, primordial *qi*).
Nine years observing the walls,
Only then does this matter become clear.

In the land of **Shēndú** (身毒, Sindhu),
There dwells a **Zhìrén** (至人, perfected sage) named **Bǎoguān** (宝冠, Precious Crown),
Who masters the art of **tāixī** (胎息, embryonic breathing),
Thus his form never withers.

**Pútí Dámó** (菩提达磨) heard of it and journeyed to inquire:
*"In the lands of **Zhèndàn** (震旦, China),
Men cannot endure heat and cold,
Draining their true essence and hastening their demise.
I intend to travel widely,
And wish to learn the **tāixī** (胎息) method,
To revive them."*

**Chapter on Embryonic Breathing**

Precious Crown sat in repose:
*"I speak to you now.*

The human being at birth,
Origins from embryonic breathing.
The spirit-mind (*shénshí* 神识) and essence (*jīng* 精) harmonize and congeal.
The sun and moon transform,
And thus the form emerges.
When the form first takes shape,
The spirit abides within it.

Hence, the spirit without form cannot dwell,
The form without *qi* cannot transform,
The *qi* without form cannot manifest.
Therefore, the spirit and form—
These are the roots of receiving *qi*;
The *qi* is the foundation of nourishing the form.
When the three are harmonized,
Only then does one emerge into the world.

While dwelling in the maternal womb,
It lies dormant beneath the navel,
In chaotic unity for three months,
The dark female (*xiānpín* 玄牝) is complete—
The nose.
The dark female being complete,
Like a melon with its stem,
It subtly draws maternal *qi*,
Thus when the mother inhales, he inhales,
When the mother exhales, he exhales,
Softly and unceasingly,
For ten months, *qi* is full and the form steadfast,
The spirit complete and the mind (*shí* 识) perfected,
And thus he breaks free from the womb and is born.

After ten days of birth,
Emotions manifest outwardly;
From infancy to childhood,
Fingers and gazes express joy and anger—
First true, then false,
And thus he loses the Dao.

Moreover, his thoughts wander to external greenery,
His eyes dazzle at five colors,
His ears indulge in five sounds,
His nose is bewildered by myriad fragrances,
His tongue craves excess flavors,
His body delights in softness and warmth,
His mind entangles in joy and anger,
His spirit and intelligence are strained in labor,
Questions press without respite,
Day and night he races without end—
His pure and simple nature is utterly dispersed.

Thus his form withers, his hair falls out,
His *qi* is exhausted, his spirit declines,
Heat and cold assail him, and he cannot resist—
How could he endure to live long?

The perfected sage (*shèngrén* 圣人) thus knows
The five elements' *qi* and essence form his body,
So he cultivates the five elements' *qi* and essence to replenish them,
Returning to the origin and embracing the primordial,
To grasp the mechanism of embryonic breathing.

When the heart is tranquil,
The spirit rejoices;
When the spirit rejoices,
Fortune arises.

Why so?
The spirit is the child of *qi*,
The *qi* is the mother of the spirit.
When the spirit is active,
The *qi* is nourished;
When the *qi* is severed,
The spirit perishes.

To achieve eternal life,
One must harmonize spirit and *qi*
While the heart remains undisturbed,
Guarding the inner breath,
The spirit not enslaved to the external,
Neither departing nor arriving,
Neither emerging nor entering,
Serene and ever abiding.
Thus the dark female's gateway—
The threshold of eternal life.

Moreover, he does not ponder external things,
He does not gaze at external hues,
He does not indulge in external desires,
He does not crave external tastes,
Ever observing inwardly,
His heart blazing yet unscattered,
His spirit merging with *qi*,
Returning to the source of the five *zàng* (藏, viscera) and six *fǔ* (腑, bowels).

In time, spirit and *qi* become clear,
Illuminating the five *zàng*,
Flowing through the four limbs.
Ordinary men's breathing
Issues from the throat,
But the sage's *qi* resides in the *qìhǎi* (气海, Sea of *Qi*).
The *qìhǎi* lies three inches below the navel,
Called the *Zǐgōng* (子宫, Womb),
The root of primordial *qi*.

This is my *Zhēnyī* (真一, True Unity) *qi*.
Whoever can guard it,
Softly and unceasingly,
This is called returning to simplicity and embracing the primordial,
Allowing *qi* to congeal and settle,
Neither dispersing nor transforming—
The five *zàng* and six *fǔ* remain firm and unharmed,
The body thus does not decay,
The spirit and mind (*shénshí* 神识) remain tranquil—
The essence of eternal life.

Therefore, the form is the dwelling of *qi*,
The master of the spirit.
If the master does not guard the inner,
But is enslaved to the outer,
Then the dwelling becomes empty and collapses.

O vulgar man!
Not a single breath abides in the *qìhǎi*!

The sage rules with spirit as sovereign,
And *qi* as lord.
If breathing does not align with spirit as sovereign,
If inhaling does not embrace *qi* as lord,
Not a single breath is complete—
And thus harm befalls embryonic breathing.

Therefore, if spirit and *qi* do not harmonize,
They cannot congeal in the *Zǐgōng* (子宫, Womb),
The Three Caverns, and the Six Viscera.

If the spirit can master *qi*,
Then the nose has no outgoing breath—
This is the true practitioner of embryonic breathing.

The vulgar man,
When confronted with sensory stimuli,
Generates attachment and lust,
And thus his *qi* drains downward,
His body withers and decays—
Hence it is said:
No benefit from a single drop of essence,
Yet constant loss from fleeting desires,
Forfeiting the root of life.

Only when spirit and *qi* are united,
And the child and mother guard each other,
Following the breath's ascent and descent,
Dispersing and replenishing the Three Palaces,
Does the essence and spirit remain undispersed.

Thus, steadfastness (*dìng* 定) is the root of not dying,
The heart is the master of *qi*.
Therefore, *qi* follows the heart's movement—
When the heart moves, *qi* moves;
When the heart stirs, *qi* stirs;
When disordered, *qi* is disordered;
When tranquil, *qi* is tranquil;
When anxious, it is injured;
When troubled, it declines.

Hence the sage does not exert himself when inactive,
Does not dwell when not enslaved,
Does not become disordered when not tranquil,
Adapting naturally to his own nature,
Eliminating all inner delusions—
This is the foundation of eternal life.

Thus always reflect:
The inherited body from parents is called embryonic breathing.
Later, it manifests through the six senses—
Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
The five *zàng* and six *fǔ*,
Bones, flesh, sinews, and meridians,
All draw from embryonic breathing and grow thereby.

The root of embryonic breathing
Neither emerges nor sinks,
Like the *yīngzǐ* (鹦子, phoenix egg),
Its hue like *shuǐjīng* (水精, crystal water).
When thoughts stir, it moves—
Yet the inner *qi* does not exit,
The mind follows its emission and thus has departure and return.

Covering the heart and drawing the neck inward,
This is the master—
The external form of departure and return—
Called the *Hèxíng* (鹤形, Crane Form).

Filling the waist and solidifying the abdomen,
This is the internal form of movement—
Called the *Guīxíng* (龟形, Tortoise Form).

With intent, draw it,
Not through exhalation and inhalation,
Nor through grasping and fixing—
These two are the dark female's gateways,
Ever to be closed,
Allowing *qi* to circulate through the body.

First enter a quiet chamber and sit cross-legged,
As if entering *dìng* (定, meditative absorption),
The body unmoving,
Visualize embryonic breathing,
Like clouds and mist,
Like the smoke of a burning furnace,
Like the threads of a lotus root,
With intent, draw it,
Circulating through the Four Extremities,
The pulse flowing freely;

Next, draw the *qi* to irrigate the *cùwán* (促丸, testicles/sperm sac),
Then draw the *qi* to gather at the tip of the tongue,
Agitate and refine it,
Visualize it like a parrot swallowing food into its abdomen—
Do not err in this,
So that the Five Zang Organs and Six Fu Viscera may all receive its vital *qi* and become firmly solidified.
Thus, the body becomes luminous and supple—
This is the *qi* of embryonic breathing wandering within the body.

When hunger or thirst arises,
Then swallow it at times,
Sending it with intent,
Do not count the number—
This is acceptable.
When sated, rest and recover.

Wherever pain or illness is present,
Attack it with intent,
And cease once it is cured.

In movement, rest, sleep, or sitting,
Always retain embryonic breathing.
If the embryonic breathing does not disperse,
After five years or three years,
Great achievement will be accomplished.

If the *qi* descends, do not stop it—
Stopping it will lead to illness.

Once the achievement is complete,
There is no need for a quiet chamber—
Practice refinement at will.
Always visualize the body as if playing with a shuttlecock (蹴鞠, *cuju*).

When internal *qi* is full and abundant,
The limbs become light and agile.
Thus, again observe my body,
My mind,
My embryonic breathing—
Gradually growing vast, merging with the Great Emptiness (太虚, *Tàixū*).

At first, visualize my body as the moon—
Sitting in a room, its light fills the room,
Residing in a city, its light fills the city,
Traveling through a land, its light fills the land,
Until it encompasses the ten directions of emptiness,
And my body is unseen.
My mind and embryonic breathing are pure and unified with the void,
Without thought or contemplation,
Serene and tranquil in stillness.

As such, once observed,
Return to the prior visualization—
From land to city,
From city to room,
Gradually shrinking again,
Then further refine it.

Desiring to wander in other realms,
It is but a single thought.
Desiring to conceal its form,
When intent arises, it vanishes.

Life and death become as natural as the self—
Eating and not eating cause no disturbance,
This is the completion of the Dao.

Thus, cultivate the spirit like an infant,
Content and serene like a child,
And in cold, heat, decay, or flourishing,
The form and spirit will naturally remain balanced.

Breath and spirit unite,
Like a crystal vessel containing a golden statue.
The golden statue is the *Dharmakāya* (法身, *Fǎshēn*).
The crystal vessel is the *rūpa* (根形, *gēnxíng*, fundamental form).

Thus, when the mirror is clear, the *Dharma* manifests itself,
When the water is pure, the reflection remains still.
Heavenly nourishment (天食, *Tiānshí*) nourishes the spirit;
Earthly nourishment (地食, *Dìshí*) nourishes the form.
Embracing the *Hun* (含灵, *Hánlíng*, vital soul) and holding the *Shen* (抱实, *Bàoshí*, corporeal spirit),
The spirit and *qi* will naturally become refined.

The marvelous medicine of the Snow Mountains (雪山之妙药),
Grows from the crown—
Practice the *Kōngmèi* (空昧, *Kōngmèi*, Void Illumination),
The body becomes light, the spirit content,
Thus, blood transforms into milk,
And bones into *qióng* (琼, *qióng*, precious jade).

Hence, it is said:
The essence of Heavenly Dao (天道之精, *Tiāndào zhī jīng*)
Is profound and mysterious,
Spirit unseen, form unseen,
This is the mind without mind,
The form without form—
The mind itself has no existence,
How much more so the external?

**From the *Shèngtāi Piān* (聖胎篇) of *Zhì Yóuzǐ Zēng Kǎo’s* (至游子曾慥) Collection**

**The Sacred Embryo Chapter**

Bow to shake the hundred passways,
Raise to follow the four seasons;
Conform to the Mysterious Path,
And enter the realm of *Xīyí* (希夷).

The Purple Microstar *Tàiyī* (紫微太一) speaks:
*"The practice of piercing passways and penetrating joints*
*without bending and stretching, guiding and drawing,*
*is how qi flows and moves.*

*The practice of dispelling cold and draining heat*
*without exhaling and inhaling, breathing out and in,*
*is how balance is achieved and released.*

*The practice of dispelling toxins and purifying clarity*
*without stirring drinks, rinsing, and swallowing,*
*is how stillness is deepened and congealed.*

*The practice of returning essence and gathering qi*
*without the union of masculine and feminine,*
*is how it ascends and rises.*

*The practice of forming the embryo and dividing the form*
*without the pearl dissolving and the tortoise breathing,*
*is how it bears and gives birth.*

*The practice of subduing demons and killing the corpse*
*without the secrets of *mì* (密), *jī* (机), and sacred transformation,*
*is how it is consumed and annihilated.*

*These six methods*
*are the ladder and vessel for attaining the True,*
*the tracks and wheels for the Dao’s path.*

*All practices of guiding and drawing, inhaling and exhaling,*
*conducting qi and refining elixirs,*
*forming the embryo and preserving the spirit*
*must first contend at the throat’s gate.*
*Close the mouth firmly and let the breath dwell in the nose.*
*If the nose opens slightly, external winds invade,*
*inviting the eight perversions’ harm.*
*Thus, one: if qi is lost, the Original Qi will be disordered.*

*Close the mouth, steady the breath,*
*stand with feet parallel, hands relaxed,*
*and sway like phoenix wings—nine times.*

*Then, cross the fingers before the heart,*
*slowly drawing force straight to the chest.*
*When force is exhausted, float and draw it upward to the crown—*
*this is called *Qǐtiān* (起天, Rising Heaven).*

*When force is exhausted, pull upward in east and west—nine tugs.*
*Then, from the crown, spread the fingers and float,*
*drawing the waist erect, bending down past the knees to press the feet—*
*this is called *Lìdì* (立地, Standing Earth).*

*When force is exhausted, advance and retreat the waist—*
*nine rubs upon the feet,*
*thus three times.*
*Then, straighten the body, steady the breath,*
*and daily practice this method,*
*which can open the three hundred sixty passways and joints,*
*the eighty-four thousand hair-pores.*
*Prolonged practice strengthens the kidney hall,*
*stops seminal emission,*
*fortifies the waist and spine,*
*and brightens the complexion—*
*thus extending life by a decade.*

*Close the mouth and sit,*
*spread the feet, cross the fingers before the heart,*
*slowly drawing force straight to the waist.*
*When force is exhausted, float and draw it upward to the crown.*
*When force is exhausted, pull upward in the west—nine tugs.*
*Then, from the crown, spread the fingers and float,*
*slowly drawing the waist erect,*
*bending down past the knees to the soles—*
*force exhausted, thus three times.*
*This is called *Guàigān Pánlóng* (怪柑盤龍, Marvelous Orange Coiling Dragon).*

*Then, straighten the body, sit cross-legged, steady the breath,*
*and daily practice this method,*
*which can drain the bladder’s stagnant water,*
*dispel the yin-qi of neck and shoulders,*
*clarify the seven orifices,*
*benefit the three passways,*
*prevent nightmares,*
*and avert dizziness.*
*Six years of practice transforms decay into youth.*

*Close the mouth and sit cross-legged,*
*clench the fists before the chest like a bow’s draw,*
*push open the front hands as if bearing Tai Mountain,*
*and pull open like a full moon.*

*When force is exhausted, twist the wrists left and right—three times each.*
*This is called *Wǎnshè* (挽射, Drawing and Releasing).*

*This method opens the Great Spine’s passway,*
*unblocks the tortoise-snake’s orifices,*
*internally connects the seams and gaps,*
*and flows to the Upper Burner,*
*preventing red eyes, sore throats, mouth sores, and toothaches,*
*and paralysis of the back.*
*Six years of practice renders one invulnerable to ten thousand poisons.*

*Close the mouth and sit cross-legged,*
*retract the Red Dragon’s tail,*
*lay the hands palm-up across the chest and abdomen,*
*and float, flapping and merging like wings—twenty-nine times.*
*This is called *Cāng’ē Gǔyì* (苍鸦鼓翼, Crow Flapping Wings).*

*This method opens the seventy-two bones of chest and back,*
*disperses the five internal perversions,*
*and unblocks the phoenix’s passways—elbows, joints, and tail.*
*It aids the spleen’s transport to dissolve water and grain,*
*strengthens the True Essence in the stomach’s precinct,*
*and harmonizes the harmonious qi of the four limbs.*
*Nine years of practice grants strength like a raging tiger.*

*Close the mouth and sit cross-legged,*
*rub the palms until warm,*
*then massage the eyes until heat subsides,*
*and from the inner canthus, wipe toward the outer—nine times.*
*Use force as the eyes open and close,*
*creating flashes like lightning—nine times.*
*This is called *Mó Jìng Shǎn Diàn* (磨镜闪电, Polishing Mirror Lightning Flash).*

*This method burns away the eyes’ toxins,*
*dispels yin-winds,*
*stops the liver’s damp-heat from descending into the water reservoirs,*
*and its heat like fire harmonizes the spirit passways,*
*warms the embryonic essence,*
*decays the Three Corpses,*
*clarifies the nine orifices,*
*and disperses the six palaces’ stagnant filth.*
*It ignites the elixir field’s fiery hands as if cradling an infant,*
*and with the right hand, slowly plucking the strings,*
*eliminates seminal leakage and dampness in the scrotum.*
*Nine years of practice refines essence into gold and stone,*
*and in all encounters, no rigid yang stirs.*

*Close the mouth and sit cross-legged,*
*press the thumbs together,*
*clench the fists between the thighs,*
*and with the body’s secrets supplied,*
*the Ten Thousand Spirits’ Emperor sits upon the Dragon Palace,*
*solemn and still, as if receiving the morning court’s rites.*
*Then, first strike the front gate ten times at the teeth,*
*then strike the rear gate twenty-six times.*
*This is called *Jī Qìng* (击磬, Striking the Bell).*

*Gather the spirit—*
*if the spirit is not gathered, the Heart Emperor flies wild,*
*and if the spirit does not dwell, yin-demons tremble,*
*while sacred attainment remains unattained.*

*Exhaling and inhaling the six breaths*
*supports cold and heat, dispels external pathogens,*
*and unblocks stagnation to restore passage.*

*The Great Perverse may be countered—*
*it is permissible, using metal overcoming wood,*
*wood overcoming earth,*
*and turning the six characters to counter and release.*
*Thus, hidden yin-toxins are eliminated.*

*The Great Heat may be drained—*
*it is permissible, using metal generating water,*
*water generating wood,*
*and turning the six characters to drain and balance.*
*Thus, hidden heat-toxins are eliminated.*

*As for floating cold and floating heat,*
*only use the original six characters,*
*from nine to nine,*
*and exhale as prescribed.*

When practicing, stand with your back to **Qián** (乾) and face **Sūn** (巽), loosen your belt, and sit cross-legged. Closing your mouth, inhale the pure *qi* once; opening your mouth, exhale the impure *qi* once—each nine times.

The inhalation should be subtle, rising through the nose into the brain, then descending through the twenty-four nodes of the spine, returning to the **Dān Tiān** (丹田). Immediately, a path of turbid *qi* will ascend from the stomach to the throat and exit through the mouth—ensure no sound is heard. This is called **nourishing the pure and expelling the turbid**.

Then observe which organ is diseased. If the eyes are red, the face hot, and there is nausea—this is **liver’s floating heat**. Close your mouth, shut your eyes, cross your hands, and visualize the liver. Inhale and exhale through the liver nine times; then rinse the mouth with saliva, swallowing when full, nine times. Direct the saliva from the throat to the **Dān Tiān** three times five, and the heat will dissipate.

If the lower back aches, the body feels weak, the face is yellow, breathing is labored, urination is excessive, there is seminal emission, aversion to cold, night sweats, loss of appetite, emaciation, and frequent disturbing dreams—this is **kidney’s extreme depletion**. Practice as before: inhale and exhale nine times. Though the kidney should use **blowing**, now use the **spleen’s exhalation** to counter it. Inhale and exhale with exhalation nine times, directing to the **Dān Tiān** three times five, and yin will diminish while yang will strengthen.

For all ailments, follow the **generation-conquering principles** of the Five Phases, and none will fail to heal.

Why is this called **the restoration of yin and yang**?
The **Zǐ** (子) hexagram is **Fù** (复), its stars **Wēi** (危) and **Xū** (虚);
The **Chǒu** (丑) hexagram is **Lín** (临), its stars **Niú** (牛) and **Nǚ** (女);
The **Yín** (寅) hexagram is **Tài** (泰), its stars **Dǒu** (斗), **Jī** (箕), and **Wěi** (尾);
The **Mǎo** (卯) hexagram is **Dà Zhuàng** (大壮), its stars **Fáng** (房), **Xīn** (心), and **Shì** (氏);
The **Chén** (辰) hexagram is **Yāng** (央), its stars **Hàn** (翰), **Jiǎo** (角), and **Kàng** (亢);
The **Sì** (巳) hexagram is **Jiān** (见), its stars **Yì** (翼);
The **Wǔ** (午) hexagram is **Gòu** (遇), its stars **Zhāng** (张) and **Xīng** (星);
The **Wèi** (未) hexagram is **Chí** (迟), its stars **Jǐng** (井), **Guǐ** (鬼), and **Liǔ** (柳);
The **Shēn** (申) hexagram is **Pǐ** (否), its stars **Bì** (毕), **Zǐ** (紫), and **Shēn** (参);
The **Yǒu** (酉) hexagram is **Guān** (观), its stars **Wèi** (胃) and **Xù** (勖);
The **Xū** (戌) hexagram is **Bō** (剥), its stars **Kuí** (奎) and **Lóu** (娄);
The **Hài** (亥) hexagram is **Kūn** (坤), its stars **Bì** (壁) and **Shì** (室).
Thus one may observe the heavens.

Why is this called **inner elixir of gold**?
Begin at **Zǐ** hour, taking **Fù** (复) as the first yang. Each line represents five days. For each yang line, first close for thirty breaths, then swallow saliva three times—one swallow per three breaths. Hence, it is called **"one swallow, three swallows."**
The sage follows the dragon’s pattern, and the tiger accompanies—this is the meaning.

For each yin line, close for thirty breaths, then swallow *qi* three times, thus filling yin and yang. Five days complete two hexagrams; thirty days complete twelve hexagrams, ending at **Yín** (寅)—a full year of three hundred sixty days.

From **Zǐ** to **Sì** (巳) are six yang hours—leftward progression ends at **Sì**, completing **Qián** (乾);
From **Wǔ** (午) to **Hài** (亥) are six yin hours—rightward progression ends at **Hài**, completing **Kūn** (坤).
When **Qián** and **Kūn** conclude, the cycle returns to **Fù** (复). The **Nine Returns and Seven Reversions**—whether spanning a year, a month, or condensed into a day—are thus unified.
*Return* means circular transformation; this is the **gold elixir circulating and reverting in the cauldron**.

At **Zǐ** hour, midnight, begin with **Jiǎ Zǐ** (甲子). During **Jiǎ Zǐ** and **Yǐ Chǒu** (乙丑), *qi* is of **metal**—thus **Qián** is firm, **Kūn** is yielding, and **Qián** belongs to metal, being yang, the father, male white and female red—this is the natural way.

On the first day of the month, at **Jiǎ Zǐ**, **Zhèn** (震) arrives to receive the talisman.
**Zhèn** is the eldest son; each yang line advances yang fire, with metal as *qi*—nine being metal’s perfect number.
Nine transformations—does the sage not conceal the name of gold? From **Wǔ** (午) to **Hài** (亥) is yin; each yin line advances yin fire, each yang line retreats yang fire. Then **Sūn** (巽) arrives to receive the talisman—**Sūn** is the eldest daughter. Seven is fire’s perfect number; fire returning to metal is the **seven reversions**. The sage also conceals the name of fire.

Some say: in the eleventh month, use **fire** two *liǎng* twelve *zhū* (两十二铢), and **water** twelve *liǎng* twelve *zhū*.
In the twelfth month, use **fire** five *liǎng*, and **water** ten *liǎng*.
In the first month, use **fire** seven *liǎng* twelve *zhū*, and **water** the same.
In the second month, use **fire** ten *liǎng*, and **water** half that.
In the third month, use **fire** twelve *liǎng* twelve *zhū*, and **water** two *liǎng* twelve *zhū*.
In the fourth month, use **fire** fifteen *liǎng*—no additional water.
In the fifth month, use **fire** twelve *liǎng* twelve *zhū*, and **water** two *liǎng* twelve *zhū*.
In the sixth month, use **fire** ten *liǎng*, and **water** half that.
In the seventh month, use **fire** seven *liǎng* twelve *zhū*, and **water** the same.
In the eighth month, use **fire** five *liǎng*, and **water** ten *liǎng*.
In the ninth month, use **fire** two *liǎng* twelve *zhū*, and **water** the same.
In the tenth month, use **water** fifteen *liǎng*—no additional fire.

The twelve regions and their divisions all begin at **Yín** (寅):
**Tài** (泰) is **Yōu Zhōu** (幽州), the division of **Yàn** (燕);
**Dà Zhuàng** (大壮) is **Yù Zhōu** (豫州), the division of **Sòng** (宋);
**Yāng** (央) is **Yǎn Zhōu** (兖州), the division of **Zhèng** (郑);
**Jiān** (见) is **Jīng Zhōu** (荆州), the division of **Chǔ** (楚);
**Lí** (离) is **Sān Hé** (三河), the division of **Zhōu** (周);
**Fǎn** (返) is **Yōng Zhōu** (雍州), the division of **Qín** (秦);
**Pǐ** (否) is **Liáng Zhōu** (梁州), the division of **Wèi** (魏);
**Guān** (观) is **Jì Zhōu** (冀州), the division of **Zhào** (赵);
**Bō** (剥) is **Xú Zhōu** (徐州), the division of **Lǔ** (鲁).

**Kūn** is **Jīng Zhōu**, the division of **Wèi** (卫).
**Fù** is **Qīng Zhōu**, the division of **Qí** (齐).
**Lín** is **Yáng Zhōu**, the division of **Wú** (吴).

**Chapter on Primordial Qi (元气篇)**
All things arise from the **Primordial Qi** in totality;
The **Primordial Qi** is the source of all.
Inhaling and exhaling, the inner and outer harmonize in response.
Mankind is born from the **Primordial Qi** of Heaven and Earth.
With every breath in and out, the inner and outer qi align.

There are six qi:
The **heart**, the **lungs**, the **liver**, the **spleen**, the **kidneys**, and the **San Jiao** govern them.

If one masters this qi,
In one year, it circulates;
In two years, it flows freely;
In three years, the work is complete—
The **play of the Mystic Pearl** congeals in the **Dan Tian**.

What is this qi?
It is the **Dao/Way** of **emptiness**, **nothingness**, and **effortless spontaneity**.

The **heart**—does it not belong to **effortless spontaneity**?
For only when it does not move
Does it not stir within and nothing enter from without.
When inner and outer are tranquil, the spirit is preserved and the qi harmonized—
Then the **Primordial Qi** arrives.

Thus, the five **zàng-organs** are nourished,
The **meridians** flow unimpeded,
And **bodily fluids** are perpetually generated.

Then the five flavors may be distanced—
No longer hunger or thirst.
The three **Dan Tians** are perfected, and bones and flesh become firm—
Aging reversed, youth restored.

Thus, the transformation of qi:
First, it becomes **blood**;
Blood becomes **essence**;
Essence becomes **marrow**.

In one year, the qi renews;
In two years, the blood renews;
In three years, the **pulse** renews;
In four years, the flesh renews;
In five years, the marrow renews;
In six years, the **sinews** renew;
In seven years, the bones renew;
In eight years, the hair renews;
In nine years, the form renews.

Its **spirit**—thirty-six thousand—
All transformed into **Immortal**.

When the five **zàng-organs** are harmonized, **bodily fluids** arise;
When the **San Jiao** circulates the qi without obstruction,
This is called the **Jade Elixir**.

The **spirit**—the most refined and formless essence.
The **spirit** adheres to the **Dao/Way**;
In stillness, it aligns with **nature**;
Mankind perceives the **spirit**;
In motion, it aligns with **emotion**.

Thus, following **nature** condenses the **spirit**.
Prolonged stillness brings cessation;
Excess leads to transformation—
Cessation is life;
Transformation is death.
Why is this so?
Emotion shifts, but the **spirit** does not command it.

To cultivate this qi, one must be still and observe inwardly,
Ascending through **Tàishǐ**, **Tàisù**, **Tàichū**, **Tàijí**, and **Tàigāo**.

Thus, the **Primordial Qi** descends from the **top of the head** to **Yǒngquán**,
Counting the breaths inward,
Forgetting the breaths outward—
The **Primordial Qi** follows the will, reaching the three **Dan Tians**,
Circulating endlessly like water.
This is the method of prolonged observation.

**Chapter on Blood and Vessels (血脉篇)**
Within the body’s minutiae lie the five **phases**;
Separation brings conflict;
Union brings generation.

Mankind’s inner five **zàng-organs** correspond to the five **phases**.

The **liver**—**Wood**—its **spirit** is the **Azure Dragon**.
Its qi ascends from the left side of the **spinal column’s victory point**,
Entering the eyes above,
Its transformation is **tears**.
**Tears** are the **true Wood**.
The residual qi flows into the left upper **hip**, becoming **Jade Nectar**.

The **lungs**—**Metal**—its **spirit** is the **White Tiger**.
Its qi ascends from the right side of the **spinal column’s remaining point**,
Entering the nose above,
Its transformation is **phlegm**.
**Phlegm** is the **true Metal**.
The residual qi flows into the right upper **flank**, becoming **Golden Elixir**.

The **heart**—**Fire**—its **spirit** is the **Vermilion Bird**.
Its qi ascends from the left upper abdomen,
Entering beneath the tongue,
Retreating into the **heart**,
Its transformation is **blood**.
**Blood** is the **true Fire**.
The residual qi flows beneath the left tongue, becoming **Divine Water**.

The **kidneys**—**Water**—its **spirit** is the **Dark Tortoise**.
Its qi ascends from the right upper abdomen,
Entering the ears,
Retreating into the **kidneys**,
Its transformation is **essence**.
**Essence** is the **true Water**.
The residual qi flows beneath the right tongue, becoming **Flowering Pool**.

The **spleen**—**Earth**—its **spirit** is **Gōuchén**.
Its qi ascends from the upper **spinal column’s victory point**,
Entering the brain,
Its transformation is **saliva**.
**Saliva** is the **true Earth**.
The residual qi flows into the left upper lip, becoming **Yellow Sprout**.

Thus, there are four **symbols** more.
First, the **Golden Elder (Jīn Wēng)**—
The **lungs’** saliva, belonging to **pure yin**.
Why is it called **Golden Elder**?
Above is the **Golden Elixir**,
Within is **Divine Water** and **Flowering Pool**,
Mingling with **Yellow Sprout** to form **yang**—
This is **upper yang, lower yin**—
Thus, it is called **Golden Elder**.

Like the sun—
The sun is pure **yang**,
Within it, the **three-legged crow** belongs to the **west’s Metal**,
**Externally yang, internally yin**.

Second, the **Maiden (Nǚ)**—
The **heart’s** blood, belonging to **pure yang**.
Why is it called **Maiden**?
Above is the **pure yin** saliva,
Within it, there is **yang**—
Thus, it is called **Maiden**.

Like the moon—
The moon is pure **yin**,
Within it, the **toad and hare** belong to the **east’s Wood**,
**Externally yin, internally yang**.

Third, the **Infant (Yīng’ér)**—
The **kidneys’** essence, belonging to **pure yin**.
Why is it called **Infant**?
Like a man—
Pure **yang** within contains pure **yin essence**,
This is **yang within yin**—
In terms of the **Two Complements**, **Kān’s male, Lí’s female**.

Fourth, the **Yellow Crone (Huáng Pó)**—
The **spleen’s** saliva, belonging to **yin**.
Why is it called **Yellow Crone**?
**Upper yin, lower yang**—
No **yin-yang** pairing—
This is **lonely yin**.

The body contains seven treasures—do you know them?
They are: **saliva**, **water**, **phlegm**, **blood**, **spirit**, **qi**, and **essence**.

The **qi** entering the nose belongs to the **liver**,
The **qi** exhaled belongs to the **lungs**;
The **qi** blown from the mouth belongs to the **kidneys**,
The **qi** expelled belongs to the **heart**;
The **qi** of **anger** belongs to the **bladder**;
The **qi** of **joy** belongs to the **San Jiao**;
The **qi** of **intent** belongs to the **spleen**;
The **qi** exhaled upward belongs to the **small intestine**;

「The **qi** of grains flows to the **lower dantian**—
This is the **true qi** of the Nine Heavens residing within the body.

The **heart**—**li** (離) with its central void—is **fire**;
The **gallbladder**—**xun** (巽) below, short#2—is **wind**;
The **liver**—**zhen** (震) with two upward tilts#3—is **thunder**;
The **small intestine**—**kun** (坤) sixfold, severed#4—is **earth**;
The **lungs**—**dui** (兑) above, truncated#5—are **marshes**;
The **large intestine**—**qian** (乾) threefold, linked#6—is **heaven**;
The **kidneys**—**kan** (坎) full within—are **water**;
The **urinary bladder**—**gen** (艮) inverted like a bowl—is **mountains**.

This is also how the body corresponds to the Eight Trigrams. Those who cultivate the **Dao/Way** should likewise ponder these principles.

In the **"Regulating Qi" (Tiáo Qì) Chapter**—
The **Sea of Original Qi** (Yuán Qì zhī hǎi) is regulated through **breathing** (xī).
After purifying the turbid, the clear gathers itself.

The **Shan Mountain Immortal (Sōng Yuè Xiān Rén) Lǐ Fèngshí** said:
*"Those refining their substance should dwell in a secluded chamber,
With a pillow two inches high,
And a bed three feet in height,
A soft mat for the seat, damp earth for the base,
Clothing suited to the balance of cold and warmth.
Lie on your back with knees firmly pressed,
Close your eyes and do not open your mouth,
Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth#7,
Clasp your hands at the two breasts,
And tap your teeth to gather your **spirit** (shén).
This is the primary task of learning the **Dao/Way**."*

To activate **true qi**, first regulate the joints to open them.
The **"Six Reductions" (Liú Mó Zhě)**—ten exhalations, twenty inhalations—
Hold your eyes wide, gaze like a tiger,
Twist your gaze westward,
Raise fists alternately left and right.
Then massage your eyes and tug your ears,
Extend your hands forward and backward,
And wipe your face—this is the method of **inhalation-exhalation** (xiāo yù).

At the start of **qi cultivation**, if the **San Jiao** is not yet harmonized,
And **swallowing qi** does not descend,
When **upper Jiao** stagnates and fails to discharge,
First learn to regulate its **qi**—
Then turbid **qi** disperses, and clear **qi** flourishes naturally.

The key lies in knowing the **gates** of exhalation and inhalation.
The **nose** is the **Heavenly Gate** (Tiān mén),
The **mouth** is the **Earthly Door** (Dì hù).
Inhaling through the **Heavenly Gate** and exhaling through the **Earthly Door**—
This is **harmonizing qi** (shùn qì).
Reversing this is **countering qi** (nì qì).

Thus, **countering** leads to **blockage** (yōng sè),
**Harmonizing** leads to **freedom** (xuān tōng)—
This is the principle of **yin-yang**.

Once you know its **harmonizing** and **countering**,
Inhale through the nose to draw in clear **qi**,
And exhale through the mouth to expel turbid **qi**.

Why does turbid **qi** emerge from the **organs**?
Humans consume the **Five Flavors**, each governing one **organ**,
And there are also the **qi** of the **Six Fu**,
All converging at one **gate** to form turbid **qi**.

How can you discern it?
When asleep, with the mouth closed, the **Five Organs**’ **qi** stagnates at the throat.
Upon waking, a great exhalation dispels it—
This is the **heavy turbid** and the **accumulation of evils**.

Thus, before **qi cultivation** and **breathwork**,
First exhale to clear the turbid,
Then proceed.

If one suffers from **dry mouth, stiff tongue**,
**Cheeks lacking moisture**, or **sore throat** unable to eat—
This is the sign of **heat**.
One must open the mouth widely and exhale **ten to twenty breaths**,
Then tap the teeth **seven to eight times**,
Roll the tongue and rinse the **Pool of Flowers** (Huá Chí),
And swallow it.
The **Pool of Flowers**’ **water** is **saliva**.

Again, let the **breathing** follow its natural rhythm,
Regulating it **three to two times**,
Then exhale again—
Once done, regulate the **breathing** once more,
Waiting until the **heat subsides** before stopping.

How does one know the **heat has subsided**?
When **clear water** emerges from the throat,
And **sweet nectar** is generated—then it is so.

For **qi** originates from the **heart**;
If the **heart** is **evil**, then **qi** is **evil**;
If the **heart** is **pure**, then **qi** is **pure**.

When one moves hands and feet,
Or experiences **joy, anger, sorrow, or delight**—
All stem from the **heart**.
The **heart**’s impulses all arise from **qi**.

Thus, **qi** complete means **body at ease**,
**Qi** lost means **body perishes**.

Physicians press the **pulse** to discern the **Five Organs**’ and **Four Seasons**’ rising and sinking.
Can I, who observe the **mouth** and **nose** for **taking** and **discarding** **qi** in an instant,
Not allow it to **exit or enter**?
Therefore, one should use the **Six Breaths** to govern it.

The **embryonic origin** is the **master** of the body,
The **Six Breaths** are the **ancestors and progenitors**.
The **Heavenly Gate** draws them in,
The **Earthly Door** expels them—
Continuous inhalation and exhalation,
**Breathing** regulated in rhythm—
Thus, the **Three Dantian** become serene,
And **jade nectar** flourishes from here.

Before noon, after the **child hour** (zǐ shí),
Divide **yin** and **yang**,
Tap the teeth to gather the **spirit**,
Swallow **once, twice, thrice**—
All three are **San Jiao**,
And the **Twelve Jade Palaces** (Yù Lóu) are engaged.
The throat has **twelve nodes**, hence called **palaces**.

Water in **kan** (坎) turns and drips#8.

**Thirty-six breaths** constitute one **cycle** (shí),
And within **ten breaths**, one **sips**—
Prolonged practice leads to **longevity**.

**Swallowing** governs the **lungs**, which belong to the **nose**.
If **qi** is unbalanced,
Or from **exhaustion, heat, or skin ailments**,
Or **ulcers and upper-body heat**—
It can be applied.

**Exhaling** governs the **heart**;
For **heart pain, stagnation, dry mouth, and stiff tongue**,
Or various **evil qi**—
It can be applied,
With wide mouth for **great heat**, and narrow for **less**.

**Blowing** governs the **kidneys**;
For **deafness, cold or weak waist and legs**—
It can be applied.

**Inhaling** governs the **spleen**;
For **weak qi, heat imbalance, abdominal distension, or indigestion**—
It can be applied.

**Hissing** governs the **liver**;
For **blurred or clouded vision, redness, or eye dryness**—
It can be applied.

**Snorting** governs the **San Jiao**;
For **San Jiao** disharmony,
Or **excessive gallbladder fright**—
It can be applied.
The **Five Breaths** each govern one **organ**,
And one **breath** governs the **San Jiao**.

The **Six Breaths** also have **auxiliary methods**:
When **hissing**, raise the eyes and fix them;
When **exhaling**, cross hands behind the neck;
When **inhaling**, lean forward;
When **swallowing**, hold up hands left and right;
When **blowing**, press knees tightly and embrace the chest.

In **large months**, follow the order:
**Hiss, exhale, inhale, sip, blow, snort**.

In **small months**, reverse the order:
From **snort** upward to **hiss**.

In general, after the **child hour** and before noon,
Loosen your clothing and sit upright,
Men press the **left foot** against the **right foot**,
Women press the **right foot** against the **left foot**,
Clasp hands firmly and regulate **breathing** while holding **qi**,
Waiting until **qi** stagnates—
Then, with a long **nose breath**, draw in the **qi**,
Close your eyes,
And according to the **Six Breaths**’ methods,
Exhale gently in accordance with their names—
So subtle that the ears cannot hear it.

**Spring** faces eastward;
**Summer** faces southward;」

「Late summer belongs to earth and the **spleen-qi**,
So face toward the southwest;」
**Autumn** faces westward;
**Winter** faces northward.
When practicing, stand relaxed and open,
Allowing **qi** to flow harmoniously.
If you can rise, then rise—
Men step down from the bed with the **left foot** first,
Women step out of their clothes with the **right foot** first.
Cross your legs without striving for height,
Spit without projecting far,
Walk without haste,
Brush your hair **hundreds of times** until it reaches **hundreds**,
Knock your teeth **constantly** until it reaches **tens**,
Rub your palms together and wipe your face **tens of times**,
Until your face grows warm and you cease.

**Dao Gun** Scroll Fifteen concludes:
#1 **"Hiss"** (originally *"pregnant"*);
#2 **"Short"** (originally *"severed"*);
#3 **"Shock, two lifts"** (originally *"shock, lift, and descend"*);
#4 **"Prop"** (originally *"press"*).

**Dao Gun** Scroll Sixteen, from *Youzi Zengchang’s* collection,
**Lingyuan** Chapter:
The **Great Ultimate** spreads its marvels—
Humans receive them.
Preserve and refine the **original harmony**,
Hold them and never lose them.
The **True Person** and **Immortal Matron** say:
*"The root of life lies in the **true breath**."*

The **Great Ultimate** spreads its marvels—
Humans receive **one** aspect of it,
And those who do not lose it are the **good**.
Empty halls and quiet chambers
Allow the spirit to dwell naturally,
Boiling and simmering the **spiritual palace**
Dries up its **vital fluids**—
Grief, joy, thought, and worry
Erode the form in this way.
If one is bewildered and unaware,
Then **qi** becomes disordered
And the spirit lacks foundation,
The **original harmony** exhausted
And the spirit departs.
At its nascent stage, fragile and tender,
It must be nurtured and contained.

My **root recognition** is easily altered,
For there is no fine harvest from barren fields.
Thus, **nine years** suffice to fulfill the **fire phase**,
Where **mystic correspondence** is heartless—
Their spirit is swift.

The **true heart** is **heartless**.
In **stillness and motion**, both forgotten—
This is **detachment from desire**.
The **spirit** is **nature**.
The **qi** is **life**.
If the spirit does not stray outward,
Then the **qi** will settle#1.
Between these two, which is closer?
How can one lose them and still claim **foundation**?

When **mixed and one**, yet again forget **one**,
Then you may harmonize the **original’s** emergence and retreat,
Pierce through metal and thread stone—
No difficulty in this.

Sitting is like standing, fleeting as a breath.
This is the **Dao**—
Easy to know, hard to practice.
Practice while forgetting what you practice,
And the **Dao** is complete.

As for those who **close the breath** and **count the breaths**,
This is not what I call **Dao**.
Concentrating **qi** to achieve softness,
The spirit will stay naturally,
And the **true breaths** will flow effortlessly.
With time, they **gently return** to the **original life**,
Thus the **spiritual spring** flows without drawing—
This is ineffable.

**True qi** can nourish life—
I am serene and selfless,
Fast and abstain to quiet my heart,
Moderate my speech,
Thus obtaining the **fermented sweet dew**,
Hunger and thirst vanish,
And the **true essence** appears.
At first, **laborious** in cultivation,
But when the work is done—
**Leisurely** and free.

Within **laboriousness**, there must also be **leisure**,
To nurture the **original spirit**.
How does my heart find **leisure**?
It lies in **spontaneous mastery**—
My inner practice is **tranquil and vast**,
Seeking the **Great Stillness**.

If **form** and **spirit** cannot yet be complete,
I will not exhaust my **life**—
But will perfect my **nature**?
Those with many talents
Run counter to the path of cultivation,
Like mist and smoke failing to form rain or dew.

The **essence** of cultivation lies in **spirit-qi**,
If they are not settled—
All effort is in vain.
The **marvel** of the **non-dual** is profound,
How hard it is to grasp!

Nurturing an infant,
One must **guard its mother**.
I have often rejected cleverness,
Discarded sharp intellect,
Nurtured the **spirit** as **foolishness**—
Its success or failure
Is not predetermined.
Without **predetermination**,
Its **essence** will naturally endure.
With **predetermination**,
This is **spirit-immortality**.
With **predetermination** yet no **predetermination**,
Only **firmness of heart**—
Then the **true spirit** will not scatter,
And one will **ascend to the primal source**.

**Zhongyuan** Chapter:
The **Room Star** is **Azure Dragon**,
The **Parameter Star** is **White Tiger**;
The **Zhenxing Star** governs them,
The **mother of all things**.

What is the **great medicine**?
Gazing upward at the heavens,
The **Room Star** is **Azure Dragon**—
The **essence of mercury**.
The **Parameter Star** is **White Tiger**—
The **essence of lead**.
These two **qi** are **treasures supreme**.

The **Sun** is the **Crimson Bird**,
The **god of fire**.
The **Moon** is the **Dark Warrior**,
The **essence of cinnabar, lead, and elixir**.

Thus, to know the **great medicine**
And establish the **original foundation**,
One must obtain the **central earth** of **Steward-Master**—
The **earth** born from the **Zhenxing Star**,
Capable of bearing the **mother of all things**.

Mercury arises from cinnabar,
Yet cinnabar again becomes mercury—
No cinnabar form is seen,
Until it returns to its root and becomes cinnabar once more.

Thus, the **Azure Dragon** is the dwelling of cinnabar,
Where yin and yang merge their essence;
The **White Tiger** is the abode of black gold.
Clad in coarse robes yet holding jade within,
Black without, white within—
Refined, it becomes true lead.

Hence, the ancient sages said:
*"This is the essence of the divine dragon."*
The **Eight Worthies of Huainan** declared:
*"This is the autumn stone."*

What is the **autumn stone**?
**Geng** is born of metal, corresponding to the **West**,
**Xin** is born of stone.
Within cinnabar, where mercury is born, lies the **divine water**.

Thus, **divine water** is the spirit of mercury—
The **Wood Sovereign of the East (Jia-Yi)**,
The **Lord of Fire in the South**.
This is cinnabar—
Its hue is red, belonging to yang,
The domain of the **South**.

The **Dragon** and **Tiger** are the two **qi**;
When they warm each other within the crucible,
It is as when a person conceives—
The vital essence blends indistinctly,
Their union taking form,
Thus, with water determining the four seasons,
They become the **Great Returning Elixir**.

Their two essences harmonized,
Their form like **milky flowers**—
They naturally restrain each other.

From the **eleventh month**, when **one yang** first emerges,
Until the **fourth month**, when **pure yang** reigns,
Entering the **fifth month**, when **one yin** begins,
Yin and yang generate and interact,
Thus, they naturally mediate.

When yang reaches its peak and yin arises,
At the **center of Jia-Wu**, the yang hexagram is applied—
From **Child** to the **center of Wu**,
Thus, the **six hexagrams** enter the **Qian position**.
The six hexagrams belong to the **Qian palace**.

Cinnabar is produced from metal,
Mercury returns to lead.
The medicine lies within the crucible,
Pushed by the two **qi**,
And when ripe, it is as a person in the womb.

Yin and yang unite and mediate,
As if divine and numinous!

In the **tenth month**, frost and snow descend,
The **yellow sprout** ripens within,
Its color vividly apparent.
When the **yellow sprout** matures,
It is the natural divine transformation of the **Dragon** and **Tiger**.

When the elixir is complete and taken,
One must **guard the One** and preserve the spirit,
Aligning the heart with the **Way**.

I have often sat cross-legged,
Each hand rising forward and backward, swaying **thirty-six times**.
The left hand takes the right—
Swaying the **celestial pillar**, each **thirty-six times**.
Grasping firmly and swaying the **jointed carp**, **thirty-six times**,
Dual-flying the **transverse carp**, also **thirty-six times**.
The hands form a **drawing bow**—
The right draws, the left gazes back.
The hands curve like **hooks**, straining forward with force—
Each **thirty-six times**.

Gaze upon the teeth and rinse with saliva, exerting force to swallow three times—then begin the **fire-alchemy** practice.

The **Child** (子) is four *liang*—each *liang* through nine revolutions makes **thirty-six**;
The **Ox** (丑) is eight *liang*—calculated as **seventy-two**;
The **Tiger** (寅) is twelve *liang*—calculated as **one hundred eighty**;
The **Dragon** (辰) is sixteen *liang*—**one hundred forty-four**;
The **Snake** (巳) is twenty *liang*—calculated as **one hundred eighty**;
The **Horse** (午) is twenty *liang*—each *liang* through six revolutions makes **one hundred twenty**;
The **Sheep** (未) is sixteen *liang*—calculated as **ninety-six**;
The **Monkey** (申) is twelve *liang*—calculated as **seventy-two**;
The **Rooster** (戌) is eight *liang*—calculated as **forty-eight**;
The **Dog** (亥) is four *liang*—calculated as **twenty-four**.
Only **Yin-Mao** (卯) and **Yang-You** (酉) are not practiced.

**Central Yellow Chapter**
The Five Grains nourish the form, yet also bring harm;
Feasting on the **Primordial Harmony**, one remains at ease and prolongs life.

Humans receive form in the womb,
Thus **essence** and **blood** are its roots,
**Spirit-mind** and **Primordial Qi** its foundation—
Thus I illuminate the Five Viscera.

Observe the **Primordial Qi**, vast and boundless, congealing into substance.
Nurtured by the Five Viscera, it follows the **Five Phases** in correspondence;
Illuminated by the Seven Orifices, it mirrors the **Seven Celestial Luminaries** in radiance.

Within the human abdomen lies the **true qi** of the Five Phases—
Follow it, and there is no illness;
Defy it, and harm ensues.

The head is **Heaven**, the feet are **Earth**.
The **qi** of the heart, the **qi** of the bones, the **qi** of the joints—all are great,
This is called the **Divine Dwelling**.
Thus, **"Cultivation of the Way is easy, and longevity follows."**

The **Way** employs **heart-mind** and **cognition**—
If one uses the heart and abandons desire,
One ascends directly to the **Nine Heavens**—
This is its greatest essence.

The infant in the womb has no sound, no breath,
In harmony with the **Ultimate Principle**.
Once born, the Six Senses stir,
The body clings to the Five Grains,
Greed and afflictions arise,
Following the senses’ impulses—
The mouth receives external flavors, forgetting the senses;
The body endures internal toil, losing its **virtue**.
The spirit departs the form, scattering and decaying;
The form departs the spirit, losing life—
Yet they do not know
How flesh and skin correspond,
How sinews and bones interdepend.

The liver corresponds to sinews—its exterior is **claws**;
The heart corresponds to vessels—its exterior is **complexion**;
The spleen corresponds to flesh—its exterior is **lips**;
The lungs correspond to skin—its exterior is **hair**;
The kidneys correspond to bones—its exterior is **hair**.

**Salt** harms the bones;
**Bitterness** harms the blood;
**Sweetness** harms the flesh;
**Pungency** harms the **qi**;
**Sourness** harms the sinews.

Who knows their origins?
**Qi** is **Yang**; **flavor** is **Yin**.
Flavor nourishes the form, the form nourishes **qi**, **qi** nourishes **essence**—
At first, did they not mutually support one another?
Yet later, they all oppose each other.

Thus, **essence** consumes **qi**, and **essence** is harmed;
The form consumes flavor, and the form is harmed.
When **grain-qi** flourishes, **Primordial Qi** declines,
Until one reaches old age.

In **Spring**, the month of **seventy-two days**,
Reduce **bitterness**, increase **pungency** to nourish the **lungs**;
In **Summer**, the month of **seventy-two days**,
Reduce **sourness**, increase **sweetness** to nourish the **spleen**;
In **Autumn**, the month of **seventy-two days**,
Reduce **pungency**, increase **sourness** to nourish the **liver**;
In **Winter**, the month of **seventy-two days**,
Reduce **saltiness**, increase **bitterness** to nourish the **heart**;
In the **late seasons** of each quarter, **eight days**,
Reduce **sweetness**, increase **saltiness** to nourish the **kidneys**—
Thus, one may attain **three hundred years of life**.

First, eliminate desire to preserve **essence**,
Then abstain from grains to sustain **life**,
Feast on **fetal qi**, on **spiritual essence**—
This is the **Way of Immortality**.

There is a land called **Hua Xu**,
Thirty *li* outside the **Supreme Sovereign’s** court,
Above, **flying thorns** are arrayed;
Below, **luxuriant flowers** spread.
To enter **Hua Xu**, one must pass through them first.

**Flying thorns** and **luxuriant flowers**—
Are they not like my **Three Pengs**?
When the **Three Pengs** vanish, I ascend to the **Fetal Immortal’s** realm.

The **Nine Immortal Lords** say:
The **Way’s** essence lies in **eighteen chapters**:
The **Classic** states:
*"Dedicate oneself to stillness and tranquility—
The body becomes like jade.
Only consume the **Primordial Harmony**, abstaining from the Five Grains."*
What does this mean?
The heart moves with each moment—
First, contend for its residence,
Internally sever all thought,
Externally sever all desire,
Then **Primordial Qi** will naturally suffice.

The world uses the Five Grains to fatten the skin,
Yet does not know they are the root of bodily decay.
The **Classic** says:
*"Salt, bitter, sour, pungent, sweet—
The Five Viscera fall ill;
Saliva entering the teeth—
The heart grows dim like a mirror."*
This is what is meant.

In the **third month of Spring**, arrange a single chamber,
Set up a low table, a bed, and a mat.

At the hour of **Child** (子), when **Primordial Qi** first arises,
Contend for the **heart-mind**—
Knock the teeth **thirty-six times**,
Clasp the hands firmly,
Raise the gaze, close the eyes,
Wait for the breath to exhale, then seal the lips and inflate the **qi**,
Swallowing as the measure.
Rinse with saliva and swallow it.

If the **qi** enters the abdomen with a **glug-glug** sound,
Stop when hunger arises—hunger, then repeat the practice.

After the **qi** enters, if the mouth grows dry, drink **sesame liquid**.
**Sesame**—three *sheng*, peeled, steamed nine times, dried nine times.
**Dried ginger**—three *liang*, finely ground into powder.
First ingest the **sesame powder**, three *liang*,
Then the **dried ginger powder**,
Decoct with water until it boils several times,
Add a little **ghee** and **honey**.

Over time, the **qi** will flow freely and harmoniously,
The swallowed **qi** will glide smoothly—
Then the **sesame liquid** may cease.
When the dregs in the intestines are exhausted,
Swallowing the **qi** becomes effortless,
And the **tang-liquid** reaches below the navel.

At the start of **qi**-cultivation,
Urination may turn **red-yellow**—do not fear.
If the **tang-liquid** does not cease,
The intestinal dregs will not be exhausted,
And one will never truly discern right from wrong.

To abstain from water and grains,
Measure it by oneself—no fixed distance.
Some do it for **thirty days**, some for **fifty**, some for **one hundred**—
The **Three Elixir Fields** will naturally fill in sequence.

Thus, after **thirty days**, the **Lower Elixir Field** fills,
The **spirit-qi** becomes full and does not disperse,
Nor does hunger arise.

Sixty days, the **Middle Elixir Field** fills,
And the body knows no emptiness nor fatigue—
Steps grow vigorous and sure.

Ninety days, the **Upper Elixir Field** fills,
The inner essence congeals while the outer form grows plump and full.
Thus, the **Three Burners** harmonize and solidify,
The **spirit-qi** condenses, the body clears—
Thoughts grow faint and distant,
And one may dwell in the sacred realm to study **embryonic immortality**.

Yet if one sometimes eats, sometimes abstains,
The will scatters and weakens;
If one indulges in flavors,
The **qi** of grains lingers, hard to dispel—
A grave affliction for those who seek the Dao.

This is the first principle of **nourishing form and spirit**.

The **Classic** says:
*"If you can guard it well, the Three Worms will abandon you,
And you will behold the Nine True Ones and the Five Tooth Qi."*

What does this mean?
To swallow the **tang-liquid** is to know no hunger—
How much more so when cultivating **qi**!

Thus, when one abstains from grains,
The **hun** and **po** transform and shift,
And the **Three Corpses** tremble in agitation.

Yet at the start of **qi**-cultivation,
After **fourteen days** or **twenty-eight days**,
When the filth has passed,
One may gradually feel the body weak,
Every joint powerless—
This is the **original qi** not yet reaching through.

Fear not.
Hold firm to it—
When the **Lower Elixir Field** fills, hunger and thirst will cease.

At first, the skin grows yellow and emaciated,
But later, it will glow with radiance.
If one eats while practicing, there will be no effect.
Generally, to swiftly reach the **Five Viscera** through **qi**-cultivation,
One must cut off the **tang-liquid**.

After **fifty days** of abstinence,
Close the eyes and inwardly visualize the **spleen’s qi**—
Rising from the heart, dispersing to the limbs.
Face outward and recite:
*"Central Steward of Wu-Ji,
Holding the original qi within,
Yellow and firm inside—
Use it to regulate,
Dan-Yang does not refuse,
Zhu-Ling joins in counsel.
When the qi reaches the limbs,
A great yellow cloud arises in the heart—
Thus, at the hour of **Chou**, do not falter.
After twenty-eight days,
One will see within the spleen’s qi,
Pressing like yellow clouds,
Spreading through the four limbs.
With time, this qi can extinguish candles,
Blow out flames—
A hundred paces away, like a great wind,
Raising clouds and mist to shroud the body."*

The **Three Corpses** reside thus:
One in the **Brain Palace**—
The **Upper Elixir Field**—
White and green in hue,
Causing one to crave food and drink,
To indulge in desires,
And unsettle the mind.

One in the **Hall of Light**—
The **Middle Elixir Field**—
Causing one to covet wealth and bribes,
To indulge in joy and anger,
And leave the spirit vague and confused.

One in the **Abdominal Cavity**—
The **Lower Elixir Field**—
Causing one to love fine clothes,
To waste on wine and lust,
And disrupt the emotions.

If one steadfastly focuses the mind,
Feeding on this qi,
Then in **thirty days**, the upper worm dies,
In **sixty days**, the middle worm dies,
In **ninety days**, the lower worm dies.
Thus, the **Five Viscera** contain the **Five Phases’ true qi**,
And one will be in communion with the **Nine Heavens**.

This is the second principle of **mysterious qi-nourishment**.

The **Classic** says:
*"The Five Teeth abhor salty, bitter, and sour flavors."*
What does this mean?
If the **Five Flavors** are not cut off,
The **numinous qi** of the **Five Viscera** will not arise.
This is the third principle of the **Five Teeth’s aversion**.

The **Classic** says:
*"Steam the sinews, dry the bones, open the passes,
Grasp the firm, unblock the **Harbor**, and open all orifices."*
What does this mean?

---

After practicing **qi-nourishment** for five weeks yet unable to sever the **qi of the grains and vegetables**,
When the weather clears and the skies brighten,
At **high noon**, sit in a secluded chamber,
Arrange the bed and spread the mat,
Loosen your hair upon the pillow,
**Grasp the firm** and gently press at the sides of the ribs.
Then **knock the teeth** seven times,
Steady the mind and close the eyes.
If you sense a faint oppression,
Forcefully **grasp the firm** and gradually open the sinews and pulses,
As **numinous qi** flows through the bones and flesh,
Moisture and perspiration nourish the skin.
Repeatedly circulating this **qi**,
Your complexion naturally becomes radiant and your vitality doubles.

**Retain the breath** to refine the form,
And the **original qi** will flow through the **hair and fur**—
The **hair and fur** will tremble and leap.
This is the fourth principle of the **contest of mists and vapors**.

The **Classic** says:
*"All orifices and passes are linked, all holding divine essence."*
What does this mean?
The **orifices** connect to the **hundred openings**,
The **hundred openings** link to the **hundred vessels**.
Above the eyes are two openings,
Which connect to the **Liver’s vessels**,
The **Liver’s vessels** link to the **Heart’s vessels**,
Thus when the **Heart** is sorrowful, the eyes overflow.
Above the brain is also an opening,
Which connects to the **nasal vessels**,
The **nasal vessels** link to the **Heart’s vessels**,
Thus when the **Heart** is sorrowful, the nose feels acid,
And when the brain is heated, the nose feels dry.
Indeed, the **hundred vessels** face the **orifices**,
And the **hundred passes** connect to the **hundred joints**,
Thus if one opening is blocked, one ailment arises,
And if one vessel is clogged, one **channel** is disordered.

For those practicing **qi-nourishment**,
The vessels become unobstructed,
The stomach and abdomen hold no residue to linger,
Cold and heat do not invade,
Toxic substances do not cling,
And the **ten thousand divine essences** begin to gather within the body,
As the **guest qi** of wounds and scars fades away.
This is the fifth principle of **orifices and passes**.

The **Classic** says:
*"What substance is the **suffering of the seventy-seven**?"*
What does this mean?
When the **dregs** are exhausted,
It is most crucial to sever the **qi of the grains and vegetables** for **forty-nine days**,
This is the most urgent matter.
As the vessels gradually open,
**Original qi** returns, bright like a candle,
The mundane mind is abandoned,
The **Five Viscera** harmonize,
And if you cannot **firm the essence**, all prior efforts will be lost.
This is the sixth principle of **enduring preservation**.

The **Classic** says:
*"Obstructed **child**—divine power’s path is hard,
Mostly **grains and vegetables** cause imbalance and disease."*
What does this mean?
When **grains and vegetables’ qi** is dense and solid,
The **Five Viscera** become congested,
**Divine qi** cannot condense,
And **numinous light** does not illuminate.

This is the seventh principle of **salt and bitterness**.

The **Classic** says:
*"When **grains and vegetables’ qi** is dense, its refined essence separates from the **numinous**,
Entangling the **Six Palaces**, dimming all the vessels."*
What does this mean?
After **forty to sixty days** of **qi-nourishment**,
When the **dregs** are exhausted but one does not know the **grains and vegetables’ refined essence** has yet to emerge,
Then thoughts of food arise,
The mind scatters and dissipates,
Nearly moved by the **Three Corpses**.
When later decay appears—
Sometimes like pus,
Sometimes like blood,
Sometimes like rotten fat,
Sometimes like **parrot droppings**—
This is when **grains and vegetables’ qi** is about to emerge.
After **thirty days more**,
If **saliva-like** or **mucous-like** substances appear,
Then the **grains and vegetables’ refined essence** has manifested.
This is the eighth principle of **grains and vegetables’ refined essence**.

The **Classic** says:
*"Self-discernment of **original harmony** and the **Nine Heavens’ qi**."*
What does this mean?
When the **qi of the grains and vegetables** is exhausted,
One recognizes the **original qi**.
This is the ninth principle of the **Three Worms’ dwelling**.

The **Classic** says:
*"From the **child**, movement generates **breathing**,
Residing within the **Elixir Field**, flickering like a flame."*
What does this mean?

「Once the **spiritual qi** is sufficient, **breathing** and movement arise,
Capable of summoning clouds and mist,
And attaining **hidden form** without obstruction.

When the **Elixir Field’s qi** is steady and full,
It ascends above and circulates below,
Forming like a **parrot’s egg**—
Its light shines through several *li*,
Strengthening sinews and bones,
And harmonizing the body.
This is the **true qi of the Nine Celestial Beings**, the tenth principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"The **true qi of the Celestial Child** nourishes the **Way’s essence**,
Retaining the **true qi** forms the **breathing of the Child**."*
What does this mean?
After **two hundred days of inhaling qi**,
The **Five Zang** are emptied,
And one may then learn the **Celestial Child’s breathing**.

First, one must prepare a **sealed chamber** with thick felt and layered mats,
The pillow’s height four fingers, level with the body.
Abandoning the **heart-mind**, one steadies the breath in a **supine position**,
Initially closing it **from ten to fifteen breaths**,
Then extending to **thirty, fifty, or a hundred breaths**,
So that the **heart-mind remains unmoved**.
Day and night, twelve hours,
Totaling **one thousand six hundred fifty breaths**.
When the breath is **fully suspended**,
The **po** guards the body while the **hun** wanders to the **Upper Heavens**.

After **a hundred breaths**,
The **hun** and **spirit** will encounter the **po**.
The **po**, a **yin spirit**,
Does not wish one to be born.
Its seven **spirits** wear **black robes**,
Their **headgear** is a **black crown**,
Their **insignia** is a **black seal**.
This is the **Dark Mother**.
If one sees her,
One must **retain her in mind** and pray:
*"Dark Mother, Dark Mother,
You are the master of my body,
Nourishing sinews and bones—
Do not leave the **Gate of the Corporeal Frame**.
I and the **Spirit-Father** together roam the **Upper Heavens**,
Next appear three figures,
Each a **foot-and-a-half** in length,
Their robes **vermilion**, their **headgear** **vermilion crowns**,
Their **insignia** **vermilion seals**.
They lead the **spirits of the Upper Primordial Palace’s cerebrum**—
Over a hundred—**outward**.
One’s body then reveals **a single qi** in the **two Elixir Fields**,
Like a **white cloud**, luminous and penetrating.
Then, one must **solemnly call** the names of the **Three Hun**:
The first, **Awakening Spirit**,
The second, **Fetal Light**,
The third, **Profound Essence**.
Having obtained this **yang spirit**,
One leads the **cerebral spirits** by their **radiant qi** to wander in the **Upper Heavens**.
At first emergence,
One feels the body **exit from the black chamber**,
Encountering **ghostly spirits** in **deceptive forms** and **strange essences**—
Some vast, some minuscule.
Only **do not fear** them,
And when **nothing is seen**, it is considered auspicious.

Thus, those who practice this **Dao** must **seek like-minded companions** to dwell with,
Lest one’s visions **inspire terror** and prevent the body from departing.
Then, one must **instruct companions** to **record the number of breaths**.

This is the **true qi of the Child’s Breathing**, the eleventh principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"The **true qi of the Five Zang** flourishes like **rare herbs’ sprouts**."*
What does this mean?
The **liver**—**wood**—
Born from **fire**, conquering **earth**,
Emerging from the **east**,
Its hue **verdant and dark**.
It is received from the **yang**, and this **qi** is **concealed and closed**,
**Retained for a thousand breaths**,
Then the **green qi** circulates and **condenses**.
When practiced,
From the **hour of the Child** onward,
Every **two hours** until **fifty days**,
One sees the **qi** like a **verdant cloud**,
**Visualizing it** can treat:
**Floating heat**, **seasonal epidemics**, **swelling**, **scabies**, **sudden coughs**.

The **heart**—**fire**—
Born from **wood**, conquering **metal**,
Emerging from the **south**,
Its hue **scarlet**.
It is received from the **vermilion yang**,
**Concealed and closed for a thousand breaths**,
Then the **scarlet qi** emerges.
At **midday**, one **retains and visualizes** its **qi**,
Its form vast as a **parrot’s egg**,
Gradually, the **scarlet qi** disperses from the **crown**.
One prays:
*"Southern **Jing-Ding**,
The **scarlet dragon** resides here,
The **yin spirit** avoids this place,
The **yang organs** descend to welcome—
Reflect upon it, and it will come,
Use it, and its power is fulfilled.
After **fifty days**, the **scarlet qi** shines like **flame’s light**,
Capable of treating **ling-cough**."

The **lung**—**metal**—
Born from **earth**, conquering **wood**,
Emerging from the **west**,
Its hue **white**.
It is received for **a thousand breaths**,
Then the **white qi** emerges.
At the **hour of the Ox**, one **retains and visualizes** its **qi**,
Its form like a **white pearl**,
Its light dwelling in the **eyebrow region**.
One invokes:
*"Western **Geng-Xin**,
**Great Micro** and **Profound Darkness**,
Internally responding to the **Six Fu**,
Externally manifesting as the **lung spirit**,
Appearing in the **qi’s ascent**,
Wandering in the **Elixir Field**,
Steadfastly guarding my life—
Use it, and one attains **transcendence**."

After **one visualization**,
At **forty-nine days**,
The **lung** contains **qi** like a **white cloud**,
Capable of illuminating **thick earth**,
All **treasures**, and discerning **human virtue and vice**—
**Seeing the exterior to know the interior**.
If one does not practice the **Five Qi** visualization method,
Then one must **inhale qi for three years**,
Only then will the **Five Zang’s qi** appear,
And one must **distinguish the principles of birth, conquest, cold, and heat**.
When **cold**, one uses the **heart’s qi**—the **fire**—;
When **heat**, one uses the **kidney’s qi**—the **water**.
Thus, if one does not **know how to use the qi**, there will be **no effect**.

The **spleen**—**earth**—
Born from **fire**, conquering **water**,
Emerging from the **center**,
Its hue **pure yellow**.
It is **concealed and closed for a thousand breaths**,
Then the **yellow qi** flourishes.
One **retains and visualizes** it **once daily** without restriction,
At **forty-nine days**, one sees its **qi**,
Capable of **entering walls** while others cannot perceive it.

The **kidney**—**water**—
Born from **metal**, conquering **fire**,
Emerging from the **north**,
Its hue **black**,
Known as the **Lower Primordial**,
**Guarding the Hall of Life**.
Within it lies the **true guardian**.
Do not forget the **spirits of the Five Zang’s qi**,
At the start of each **five-watch period**, one **retains and visualizes** their hues,
Their **qi** all emerges from the **crown**—then it ceases,
No need to **visualize each one individually**.
Thus, the **effect is gradual**,
Taking over **a hundred days** to manifest.
This is the **true qi of the Five Zang**, the twelfth principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"The **Primordial Extremes’ true palace** dwells in the **Azure Void**."*
What does this mean?
It is the **palace of the Upper Realm**.
Thus, the **Upper Realm** takes the **Seven Precious Essences’ refined qi** as **sun and moon**,
While the **Lower Realm** relies on **yin and yang** to **carry qi** as **sun and moon**.
A **year in the Lower Realm**—**three hundred sixty days**—
Is **twelve hours in the Upper Realm**.
This is the **Primordial Extremes’ true palace**, the thirteenth principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"Ascend further to the **Luminous Heavens** and enter **Great Micro**."*
What does this mean?
It is the **fifth hall of the Nine Heavens**.

This **Nine-Qi True Immortal** is the fourteenth principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"Cultivating stillness and refining truth makes one a **sage**,
The **Nine Practices of the Void** align the **True Load** to bear **virtue**."*
What does this mean?
The **Nine Practices** are:
1. **Compassion** as **garment** for the day,
2. **Abstinence** as **food**,
3. **Rectification of intent** as **vehicle**,
4. **Single-minded resolve** as **wealth**,
5. **Humility** as **bed**,
6. **Upright conduct** as **vessel**,
7. **Diligent benevolence** as **house**,
8. **Cultivation of the Void** as **dwelling**,
9. **Altruistic offerings** as **ornament**.
This is the **Luminous Heavens’ Mysterious Palace**, the fifteenth principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"All practices without **intent** are **true intent**,
Following **intent** brings one to return to **Heaven’s departure**."*
What does this mean?
The **true intent** without **intent** arises from the **intent** that exists.
This is the **Nine Practices of the Void**, the sixteenth principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"The **Six Palaces** hold **ten thousand deities**, ever-present and constant."*
What does this mean?
The **Great Intestine Palace** governs the **Lung Chamber**,
Its **nasal septum** marks the center for observing **colors**,
Weighing **twelve jin and ten liang**,
Stretching **one chi and two cun** in length,
And **eight cun** in breadth.
The **Great Intestine** has **twelve bends**,
Storing **one dou and two sheng of water and grain**,
With **deities** present in its **twelve hours**,
Their **garments and crowns** mirroring their respective hues.
When the **eleventh hour** arrives and the **water and grain qi** are exhausted,
Then their **deities** will appear.

The **Kidney Palace** governs the **inner officials**,
Its outer manifestation is the **ear**,
Acting as the **gate of the dwelling**.
For **essence** belongs to the **kidneys**,
The **kidneys** are the **rear officials**,
Within them are arranged **palace maidens**,
**Bing** on the left and **Gui** on the right,
Cycling through the **two ears**,
With **Primordial Deities** guarding them.
**Rage and anger** harm the **kidneys**,
Kidney injury leads to **loss of resolve**,
And the **Primordial Deities** are abandoned.
**Guarding against anger** is the **taboo of the Dao**.

The **kidneys** gather **qi** with the **Bladder Palace**,
Its outer correspondence is the **root of the tongue**,
As **qi** and **fluids** circulate,
Thus the **Bladder Palace** and the **Kidney Palace** combine as the **ferry gate**,
And the **Sea of Qi** flows in cycles as the **key path**.

Before **qi cultivation** is complete, one must **restrain speech**,
To nurture the **ferry**.
Within it are **three hundred sixty deities**,
Each corresponding to a **day’s position** in the year.
Once the **qi** is refined,
If one consistently upholds **non-greed**,
Then the **deities** will manifest and align with **virtue’s essence**.

This is the **Six Palaces of Ten Thousand Deities**, the seventeenth principle.

The **Classic** says:
*"Do not leak **Heaven’s decree**; preserve **intent**."*
What does this mean?
If one **remains steadfast from beginning to end** without leaking,
Then the **Heavenly Deities** will aid them.
This is the **preservation of Heaven’s decree**, the eighteenth principle.

**The *Yunyuan* (循环) Chapter** of *Dao Shū* (道枢) concludes.

---
**#1 *Yunyuan* (运火) Chapter**
The *yin-yang* fires advance in measured cycles;
The *sun-moon’s degrees* (日月之度) are their model and reflection.

**Yin True Lord** (阴真君) says:
*"One, two, two-four, three-six, four-eight, five-ten-six, twelve-seven, fourteen-eight, sixteen-nine, eighteen-ten-two, eleven-twenty-two, twelve-twenty-four, thirteen-twenty-six, fourteen-twenty-eight, fifteen-thirty-one, sixteen-thirty-two, seventeen-thirty-four, eighteen-thirty-six, nineteen-thirty-eight, twenty-ten-one, twenty-two-twenty-two"—these are the cycles of the **ascending yang fire** (进乎阳火).
*"Sixteen-thirty, seventeen-twenty-eight, eighteen-twenty-six, nineteen-twenty-four, twenty-three-twenty-two, twenty-four-twenty-one, twenty-five-twenty, twenty-six-eighteen, twenty-seven-seventeen, twenty-eight-sixteen, twenty-nine-twelve, thirty-seven, thirty-eight-twenty-six, thirty-nine-twenty-four, forty-four, forty-five-twelve, forty-six-twelve, forty-seven-eighteen, forty-eight-twenty-six, forty-nine-twenty-nine, fifty-four-thirty-two"—these are the cycles of the **ascending yin fire** (进乎阴火).*

My **fire’s numbers** (吾火之数) indeed match those of the **Red Gold Lord** (红金子) and **Wei Boyang’s fire** (魏伯阳火), harmonizing with the **sun-moon’s courses** (日月之行度) and the **celestial revolutions of stars** (天轮周星). This exhausts the **numbers of Heaven and Earth** (天地之数) and fulfills their **transformative functions** (造化之功), surpassing the petty methods of external schools.

The **essentials of fire’s alchemy** (火候之要) state:
*"Day and night, four seasons’ fires—Heaven and Earth’s **qi** (气) interflow.*
*All things inherit the **Five Phases** (五行), and fire’s method is in the *Cansame* (参同).*
*From Nine to Six, the cycles complete—cold and warmth’s **transformative power** (造化功) is fulfilled.*
*The **Green Dragon** (青龙) weds the **White Tiger** (白虎), in perfect union, no deviation.*
*Its radiance crystallizes into **worldly treasures** (世宝), steadfast and unyielding.*
*The **Sages** (圣人) preserved this method, hidden in the **fire arts** (火术).*

*When **yin qi** ascends and **yang qi** descends,*
*The **head and tail** (首尾) are questioned in **Wudu** (武都),*
*Five days return to one **watch** (候).*

*The **Gua of Return** (复卦) is the **primary cycle** (先首);*
*Head and tail interweave, motion arising.*
*At **initial nine** (初九), the **hours of *hai*, *zi*, *chou*** (亥子丑), three cycles are the **primary** (先首).*
*At **second nine** (二九), the **hours of *yin*, *mao*, *chen*** (寅卯辰), four cycles align with the **Six Rites** (六律).*
*At **third nine** (三九), the **hours of *si*, *wu*, *wei*** (巳午未), five cycles merge with **Sage’s intent** (圣意).*
*At **fourth nine** (四九), the **hours of *shen*, *you*, *xu*** (申酉戌), fire’s numbers must be **fully realized** (实).*

*The cycles revolve through the **twelve earthly branches** (十二辰),*
*Completing the **four seasons** (四季) in harmony.*

*At **nine-five** (九五), the **Flying Dragon** (飞龙) ascends to Heaven—*
*Do not **alter the fire’s cycles** (运火数).*
*At **upper nine** (上九), the **Dragon in Excess** (亢龙) brings regret—*
*Retreat to a lower position.*

Thus, **nine positions without yin** (九位无阴) are the **Winter Solstice’s ascension** (日升上), while **nine-Heaven without yang** (九天无阳) are the **Summer Solstice’s descent** (日降下). Therefore, the **Sages** (圣人) established methods to **return the four seasons’ fires** (还四时之火), making day and night uniform—when the fire’s numbers are complete, they **ascend to Pengtai** (蓬台) and descend to the **elixir field** (丹田), leaping upward while rooted below, and the **refined furnace** (重炉) returns to its **original essence** (本色).

**As the method dictates, reverse alchemy** (倒焚) is performed—
Thus, the **four seasons’ *qi*** (四气) are fulfilled,
And **mercury and cinnabar** (汞砂) are subdued by fire,
The **transformative work** (造化之功) complete.

**Cinnabar** (砂) is **yin-cooked and yang-refined** (阴煮而阳缎);
**Mercury** (汞) is **yang-destroyed and yin-cooked** (阳毁而阴煮).
This is the **subdued alchemy** (伏制) that yields the **returned elixir** (还丹).

---
**The *Hunyuan* (混元) Chapter**
Move in accord with **Heaven’s Way** (天道), uniting **qi** with the **Primordial** (元);
Stand firm and singular—open **Heaven** (乾) and close **Earth** (坤).

**Hunyuan True Lord** (混元真君) says:
*"**Hunyuan** (混元) is formless like the **egg of chaos** (鹦子),*
*Round above, square below,*
*Within it, **qi** swirls like dust in a crack—*
*Grasped, it has no form;*
*Gazed upon, it has an image.*
*Thus, it was named **Two Principles** (二仪).*

*When **Two Principles** intermingle, **yin and yang** emerge;*
*When **yin and yang** sustain each other, the **Three Talents** (三才) are established.*

Yet, **humans** all inherit **Heaven and Earth’s unified *qi*** (一气) at birth—
Why does **Heaven not collapse** (崩) and **Earth not sink** (陷), while **humans alone die**?

**Heaven**, with its **light and clear essence** (轻清之体), moves in **natural harmony** (顺行).
If it **reverses and opposes *qi*** (逆气), clinging to **heaviness and turbidity** (重浊),
Its **qi** exhausted, it will **collapse** (崩).
**Earth**, with its **heavy and turbid essence** (重浊之体), **rises in opposition** (逆起).
If it **reverses and harmonizes *qi*** (顺气), clinging to **lightness and clarity** (轻清),
Its **qi** exhausted, it will **sink** (陷).
**Humans** are **yang** (阳), while all **formed, tangible things** (有形相之物) are **yin** (阴).
Their **Way** clings to **yin**, veering toward **deviant perceptions** (邪见),
Diminishing **true *qi*** (正气)—
Thus, they reach **death** (死).*

If one **follows Heaven’s Way** (天道) and moves,
Consistently uniting **qi** with the **Primordial** (元),
And **Dao/Way** remains unerring,
Then **longevity** (长生) is attained.

Those who **cannot attain longevity** (不能长生者) have **lost the Primordial *qi*** (本元) and **broken the Three Wonders** (三奇).
Thus, when **Primordial *qi*** is **shattered** (破), it is **insufficient** (不足),
And their **deities** (神) perish.
When **deities** perish and **qi** is insufficient,
One naturally **does not align with Heaven and Earth’s movements** (行动).

If one **originally has no leakage** (无漏泄),
**Deity and awareness** (神识) are **unerring** (无差),
And **does not violate the Three Wonders** (三奇无犯),
With **day and night’s thoughts untainted** (昼夜神思无素),
Then one **can share Heaven and Earth’s virtue** (同德) and **match the sun and moon’s luminosity** (齐明).

Those who **cultivate the body** (修身者) may have **Primordial *qi*** **once shattered** (尝破),
And their **spirit and *qi*** (精神) are **not whole** (不全).
They must **await their spirit’s restoration** (具) and **qi’s completion** (气全),
Then **nourish life** (养命) and **become an immortal** (为仙).

Otherwise, **inner and outer *qi*** (内外之气) **will not unite** (不相合),
And **Dao/Way** cannot be **fulfilled** (成).

Why?
**Inner** (内) is **human *qi*** (人之气);
**Outer** (外) is **Heaven and Earth’s *qi*** (天地之气).
Moreover, **Heaven, Earth, and humans** (天、地、人) are all **born from the unified True *qi*** (真一之气).
When **inner *qi*** is **insufficient** (不足),
It **cannot harmonize with the old** (於旧则不合).

All **ten thousand things** (万物) arise from the **Five Phases** (五行),
And when they **decay**, they are **restored by their own kind** (以其物补之).
Thus, when **humans decay** (人之坏),
They must **investigate their root essence** (根元) to **restore it** (补).

**The Primordial** (元) is **One** (一).
At its **beginning**, it **receives the father’s one-lin *true essence*** (父之一厘之真精)
And **inherits the mother’s one-lin *true qi*** (母一厘之真气),
Sustaining each other to **form** (成).

Thus, **one yin and one yang** is called **Dao/Way**.
**Dao/Way** generates **One** (一), **One** generates **Two** (二), **Two** generates **Three** (三), **Three** generates **ten thousand things** (万物),
And **Heaven and Earth** (乾坤) are established—
Nothing is **omitted** (无不备者).
This is **humanity’s foundation** (根本).

If one **loses the Three Wonders** (失其三奇),
They must **rely on the root essence** (根元) to **cultivate anew** (修之).
Then the **Three Wonders** will **be sufficient** (自足).

The **Three Wonders** (三奇) are **deity, *qi*, and essence** (神、气、精).
**Humanity’s Primordial** (夫人元) arises from **yin-yang’s mutual resonance** (阴阳交感),
And when it **decays**, it can be **restored by yin-yang’s harmony** (用阴阳而补之),
So that **deity and *qi*** (神气) **unite with the body** (合於身).
Then **inner *qi*** will **naturally harmonize with the outer** (内气自合於外),
And when **inner and outer *qi*** unite,
They **become one with Heaven and Earth** (同於天地)."

Now the **Way of yin-yang’s restoration** (阴阳补之者) is **this**: the practitioner first **nourishes life** (养其命) by aligning with the **cyclic movements of yin-yang** (阴阳之运动), regulating **vitality and seasons** (气候), shifting **Heaven and Earth’s polarity** (乾坤), and balancing the **Five Phases’ flourishing or decline** (五行否泰). Endlessly **entering and exiting** (出入), **flowing through** (往来) and **penetrating** (贯串), they **respond to inner and outer *qi*** (与内外相应) without deviation. After **three years of cultivation** (修之三载), they will **ascend as a transcendent** (成仙矣).

Someone asked: *"From where does one obtain the **primordial *qi* and essence** (父母之精气) of the parents? How does one **transform them** (通变之)?"*
The reply was: *"The father is **Wood** (木); the **essence** (精) is **Fire** (火). These two **symbols** (象) are **one vital breath** (一气). **Wood** is the **root** (主), **Fire** is the **function** (用). The mother is **Metal** (金); the **blood** (血) is **Water** (水). These two **symbols** are also **one vital breath** (一气). **Metal** is the **root** (主), **Water** is the **function** (用). When the **Four Symbols** (四象) encounter **Earth** (土), they **generate one another** (相生); when they do not, they **counteract** (相克). Now, the **mother’s Primordial Palace** (元宫) is the **true Earth** (真土). When the **Four Symbols’ *qi*** (四象之气) arrive here, they **naturally harmonize and coalesce into treasure** (自然相顺共聚为宝), giving rise to **innate nature, will, wisdom, and insight** (性意智慧).

**Wood** is **innate nature** (性); **Fire** is **will** (意); **Metal** is **wisdom** (智); **Water** is **insight** (慧).
**Wood** uses its **innate nature** (性) to **cultivate the East** (修束方甲乙), manifesting in the **liver** (肝);
**Fire** uses its **will** (意) to **cultivate the South** (修南方丙丁), manifesting in the **heart** (心);
**Metal** uses its **wisdom** (智) to **cultivate the West** (修西方庚辛), manifesting in the **lungs** (肺);
**Water** uses its **insight** (慧) to **cultivate the North** (修北方壬癸), manifesting in the **kidneys** (肾).
The **kidneys** govern **bones** (骨) and **ears** (耳);
The **liver** governs **sinews** (筋) and **eyes** (目);
The **spleen** governs **flesh** (肉) and **lips** (唇);
The **heart** governs **blood** (血) and **tongue** (舌);
The **lungs** govern **skin and hair** (皮毛) and **nose** (鼻).
Thus, the **gallbladder** (胆) is the **liver’s chamber** (肝府);
The **small intestine** (小肠) is the **heart’s chamber** (心府);
The **large intestine** (大肠) is the **lungs’ chamber** (肺府);
The **bladder** (膀胱) is the **kidneys’ chamber** (肾府);
The **stomach** (胃) is the **spleen’s chamber** (脾府).
Each of the **Five Phases** (五行) contains **Wood’s vital breath** (木#3气), and when it reaches its **native domain** (本方), it **embodies myriad deities** (具万神), thus ensuring the **body’s completeness and fullness** (身全而体备). At **thirty days**, the **vital breath is full** (气满); at **three hundred days**, the **embodied form of creation** (造化体象) is complete. Then, **deity, *qi*, and essence** (神、气、精) are established as its **masters** (主).

The **Three Wonders** (三奇) circulate through the **mother’s nourishing and defensive channels** (荣卫经络), permeating the **body**, and descending to the **double *qi* gates beneath the Primordial Palace and breasts** (中鬲元宫双乳之下).
Thus, within **ten days**, a **membrane** (膜) forms, and upon it **Metal elixir and white grease** (金液白膏) appear;
Within **thirty days**, the **grease is full** (膏满) and the **elixir flows** (液奔奏), pouring into the **Primordial Palace** (元宫) and irrigating the **Three Wonders** (三奇);
At **forty days**, a **second membrane** (二重膜) forms;
At **sixty days**, the **grease flows into the Primordial Palace** (膏流於元宫), and the **first membrane seals** (前膜闭);
At **seventy days**, a **third membrane** (三重膜) forms;
At **ninety days**, the **grease flows into the Primordial Palace** (膏流於元宫), and the **second membrane seals** (次膜闭).
Thus, **nine membranes** (九膜) are generated.
At **three hundred days**, an **embryo** (婴儿) is born, and within **three years**, it **feeds on accumulated breast milk** (食其积乳), until **deity is complete and *qi* is abundant** (神全气足)—this is **humanity’s foundation** (人之根本).
Those who grasp this **understand the principles of self-cultivation** (修身之理得矣).
**Self-cultivation** (修身) without first **removing ailments** (除疾) will **disrupt the deity’s order** (神乱而不宁), so what need is there for **external deities** (外神)?

Now, **ailments** (疾) arise from **disharmony among the Five Zang** (五藏不和) and **obstructed nourishing-defensive circulation** (荣卫难通). When **vital breath flows smoothly** (气顺), ailments are **removed** (疾除); when it **reverses** (气逆), the **Five Zang are disharmonious** (五藏不和) and the **hundred vessels stagnate** (百脉滞). In general, when **vital breath flows smoothly** (气之顺也), the **nourishing-defensive channels circulate freely throughout the body** (荣卫周通於身), and there is **no obstruction in its passage** (往来无滞).

The **method of self-cultivation** (修身之法) is as follows: during the **hours of *qi* stagnation** (戌、亥、子之时)—when **yin-yang’s reign is gradual** (阴阳渐王) and one **rests in bed** (人寝於床)—the **vital breath stagnates in the hundred vessels and joints** (气滞於百脉关节), so **work can be activated** (故可以兴功焉). First, **extend the four limbs** (引四支), then **spread the hands and feet** (展左右手足), opening all the **hundred vessels** (百脉). **Shake and sway the body** (撼摇其身), allowing the **vital breath to circulate freely** (使气往来), reaching every part without fail. Then the **deity will naturally clarify** (神当明矣).

What does **clarified deity** (神明) mean?
The **unfathomable interplay of yin-yang** (阴阳不测) is **deity** (神);
The **radiant precision of sun and moon** (日月精朗) is **clarity** (明);
**Will’s cultivation and mechanism’s activation** (学意发机) is **deity** (神);
**Perfect application without error** (应用不差) is **clarity** (明).
Thus, one **employs the deity** (即用其神): sitting upright and **aligned in posture** (端身正坐), **abandoning all thoughts and discarding all imaginings** (绝虑忘想), awaiting the **settling of deity and *qi*** (俟神气俱定), then **inhales pure *qi* through the nose** (鼻纳清气) and **exhales turbid *qi* through the mouth** (口呵浊气).

Why?
Because **human consumption of the Five Flavors and Five Spices** (食五味五辛) all contain **restrictions and counteractions** (刑克), which can **corrupt the Five Zang** (腐五藏) and **generate disease** (生患). Thus, **pure and turbid *qi* become mingled** (清浊混), making them **difficult to discern** (难见), so one **exhales to purge the turbid** (故呵以淘其浊). Once this is done, the **vital breath is confined to nasal inhalation and exhalation** (使其气止於鼻出入).

Now, **Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire** (金木水火) are the **light and pure *qi*** (轻清之气)—the **yang** (阳);
The **heavy and turbid** (重浊) are the **yin** (阴).
The **nose** is the **Heavenly Gate** (天门);
The **mouth** is the **Earthly Portal** (地户).
Within, it **connects to the Five Zang** (内通五藏), but only through the **two paths of yin-yang and pure-turbid** (惟阴阳清浊之二路). Yet each has its **course** (各有行). The **vital breath that flows through the nose** (鼻者) must not allow the **turbid *qi* of the mouth to disrupt its purity** (不使口中之浊挠其清).

The **nose’s inhalation of *qi*** (鼻之取气) must be **continuous and gentle** (绵绵), with **no abruptness** (不可有闻).
Why?
Because **excessive breathing through the Heavenly Gate** (大纵於天门) will **disrupt the free flow** (出入自如), making it impossible to **circulate through the hundred vessels** (通百脉) or **open the four limbs’ channels** (开四支经络五藏). Once the **Earthly Portal is closed** (地户既闭), only the **Heavenly Gate’s deity and *qi*** (天门之神气) circulate, **embracing the Primordial Palace** (抱元官)—this is **guarding the One** (守一者).

When the **hundred joints are unblocked** (百节既通) and the **hundred gates are opened** (百关既开), then one **collects the salivas formed by the Five Flavors and Five Spices** (取百味所成之津液), refining them into **deity water** (神水), and **adding them into the Primordial Palace as treasure** (添入於元官以为宝)—this is **extracting and replenishing** (抽添者).

One **takes the Primordial Palace’s essence** (元宫经) from the **saliva generated in the spleen** (脾中所生百味五辛之津), allowing the **deity and *qi*** (神气) to **move along with the nourishing-defensive channels** (随其荣卫而运). From the **double gates at the spine** (夹脊双关), it **flows through the channels**, ascending to the **top of the head** (顶门), descending to the **mouth** (口), then **gargling and swallowing** (漱咽) to return to the **Twelve Palaces** (十二重楼). The **lungs** (肺) **receive it** (乃受之) and **transmit it to the kidneys** (传於肾); the **kidneys** transmit it to the **liver** (肝); the **liver** transmits it to the **heart** (心); the **heart** transmits it to the **spleen** (脾); the **spleen** transmits it back to the **Primordial Palace** (元宫)—this is the **deity water, white elixir, and cinnabar** (神水白丹砂).

Above, it **ascends to the sublingual orifice** (舌下之窍中), then **emerges onto the tongue** (走出於舌之上) for **gargling and refining** (醴漱), passing again through the **Twelve Palaces** (十二重楼), where the **lungs** (肺) **receive it once more** (复受之).

Thus three times accomplished, the **true qi** may then be cultivated. Refining it through three to five cycles, the **precious elixir** is formed.

It no longer circulates through the **Zang organs**, dwelling solely within the **heart**.
The **heart** has three **vessels** and seven **orifices**; each orifice contains three **holes**, named **Juyan** (聚涎).
What enters through the center is transmitted to the **Zang organs**; what enters from the left and right is transformed into **honorific and defensive qi**, circulating through the **Microcosmic Orbit**, returning to the **Primordial Palace**—this is the **True One**, the **true gold within water**.

Three represents the **generative and destructive cycles of the Five Phases**, hence it is called **One**.
Three is **Wood**, **Yang**, corresponding to the **emergence of life in Spring**.
Five is **Earth**, **Yin**, the foundation upon which all things grow.
Wood’s **true qi** aligns with Earth; the refined essence of Wood and Earth becomes the **supreme treasure**.
In human terms, Wood is the **father**, Earth the **mother**—this is the **Three-Five Unity**.

A child is born in **three hundred days**; how then does one nourish bones and sinews?
Only through **non-thinking, non-worrying, non-desiring, and non-craving**—when the **spirit is settled and the qi is tranquil**, the body stands firm.
Those who understand this may **harness Yin-Yang qi**, **defy Heaven-Earth’s transformations**, and thus **cultivate the body to attain sainthood**.

Someone asks: *"Why do some refine **saliva** yet fail to produce the **precious elixir**?"*
The answer: If the **Zang organs’ qi is disordered** and the **honorific-defensive circulation is already impaired**, how much more so when attempting refinement?
Such questions arise when the **Zang organs’ qi is not harmonized**. First, **regulate the Zang organs’ qi** to ensure their harmony, then refine the **saliva through three cycles**—how could it fail to become the **medicine**?

How does one harmonize the **Zang organs**?
By **investigating the foundational principles of the Five Phases** and cultivating accordingly.

**Wood** governs the **eastern direction (Geng-Xin,甲乙)**, moving purely along the **Yang path**, its birth rooted in **Bing-Yin (丙寅)**, its **trigram** **Zhen (震)**. Drawing essence from **Water**, its symbol is the **Dragon**; its number is **Nine**—Nine breaths suffice for life.
**Fire** governs **Bing-Ding (丙丁)**, its number **Three**, its **trigram** **Li (离)**—**Yin Fire**, its symbol the **Vermilion Bird**.
Two symbols, one essence: **Wood as master, Fire as auxiliary**.

**Metal** governs the **western direction (Geng-Xin,庚辛)**, moving purely in **nourishment and grandeur**, its birth in **Ren-Shen (壬申)**, its **trigram** **Dui (兑)**. Drawing essence from **Earth**, its symbol is the **Tiger**; its number is **Seven**—Seven breaths suffice for life.
**Water** governs **Ren-Gui (壬癸)**, its number **One**, its **trigram** **Kan (坎)**—**Yang Water**, its symbol the **Dark Warrior**.
Two symbols, one essence: **Metal as master, Water as auxiliary**.

**Earth** alone can **subdue the Four Symbols’ qi**, producing the **treasure**—what differs from the **parental origin**?

To **verify the Five Phases internally**, observe the **Nine Orifices**.
The **Zang organs** externally connect to the **Nine Orifices**:
- **Liver** to the **eyes**,
- **Heart** to the **tongue**,
- **Spleen** to the **mouth**,
- **Lungs** to the **nose**,
- **Kidneys** to the **ears**,
- and below to the **genitals**.
If any **orifice is obstructed**, the **Zang organs are disordered**; if the **Zang organs are balanced**, the **orifices open**.
Each **Zang organ’s pathogenic qi** manifests its **inherent color**:
- **Liver** (青), **Heart** (赤), **Lungs** (白), **Kidneys** (黑), **Spleen** (黄).
Thus, if one sees **pure green without admixture**, the **Zang organ’s qi is harmonized**.
If the **four Zang organs** do not conform to their **native colors**, their qi is **inverted**.
This is merely the **Way of Nourishing Life**—not the **Golden Elixir’s Great Medicine**.

The **Nine Circulations of the Returned Elixir** require:
- **Recognizing the Five Phases**,
- **Securing the Golden Lock**,
- **Nurturing the Mysterious Pearl**,
- **Preserving the Spirit Water**,
- **Anchoring in the Primordial Palace**, ensuring the **qi does not depart from the Kidneys**,
- **Returning the Essence to the Supreme Harmony**—this is the **Gate to Sainthood**.

Heaven and Earth use the **sun and moon** for function; humans use **honorific and defensive qi**.
If one’s **internal use aligns with the external sun and moon**, their lifespan matches **Heaven and Earth’s duration**.

The **spirit** is the **honorific-defensive qi**.
**Honorific** is the **sun**; **defensive** is the **moon**.
The **internal movement of spirit-qi** mirrors the **external cycles of sun and moon**—naturally, **internal and external unite**.

The **Greater Sun** completes a **twelve-hour cycle**, yet only **nine hours** align; the remaining **three do not**.
In **thirty days (360 hours)**, it is visible for **270 hours**, leaving **90 unseen**.
Why?
The **Greater Sun** arises at **Yin (寅)**, its qi flowing sequentially through **Xu (戌), Hai (亥), Zi (子)**, entering the **Lesser Yin’s domain**—where the two qi intersect, rendering it **unseen**.

The **Lesser Yin** in a **month** shines clearly for **twenty-four days**, then dims for **six**.
Why?
The **Lesser Yin** arises at **Shen (申)**, its qi flowing **backward** through **Xu (戌), Hai (亥), Zi (子)**, governed by **pure Yin**—thus, it is **unseen**.
It travels **twenty-seven days**, reaching the **third day of the month**—the **conjunction of sun and moon**.
Then the **Lesser Yin** dims, the **Greater Sun** vanishes.

Students must **align their honorific-defensive qi** with the **sun and moon’s conjunctions and movements**—this is the **unification of internal and external**.

The **Greater Sun** appears for **three days before and after**, reaching **Gèn (艮)** before separating from the **Lesser Yin**.
The **Lesser Yin**, rooted in its **palace**, moves from **four to eight days**, then **twenty-three to twenty-seven days**, reaching **Chǒu (丑)** before separating from the **Greater Sun**.
Thus, the **qi completes its cycle**, achieving **full brilliance**.

The **sun and moon** move in harmony with **Heaven and Earth’s qi**—this is why their duration is **eternal**.

My **honorific-defensive qi** can harmonize with theirs—then **long life** is attainable.

**Jindan** is the refining of the **Mysterious Pearl**. To return the **Mysterious Pearl** to its original position is to **restore the Primordial and reclaim the Mandate**—yet one must carefully observe the **Five Phases**. Why? The **five viscera** each manifest their own colors visibly. Thus, when practicing the **Nine Returns Method**, one must first establish the **altar symbols** and activate them.

The **altar** is the **key to Heaven and Earth**, the **root of the cosmos**, the **apex of Heaven and Earth**, and the **foundation of the Dragon and Tiger**. Without the **altar symbols**, it is like a person without a dwelling!

Within the **altar**, I sit upright and composed, observing the **four seasons’ transitions** and the **internal and external conjunctions of sun and moon**.

The **liver belongs to Wood**, so in the **three spring months**, I select a **Jiazi day and hour**, sit properly in the **altar**, and **sever all thoughts and fantasies**, always **closing the earthly gate** while **slightly opening the heavenly gate**. The **qi** circulates softly and continuously—never rushed—while I **focus solely on returning the honorific-defensive qi to the liver**. The **qi** then ascends along the spine to the brain, descends from the **crown** into the mouth, and is **gargled** before descending into the **twelve-story pavilion**, first passing through the **lungs**, then the **kidneys**, the **liver**, the **heart**, the **spleen**, and finally entering the **Primordial Palace**, where the **spirit-qi** receives it. When the count is complete, the **qi** surges and flows back into the **two orifices beneath the tongue**, its color **green**—this is the **harmonious flow of liver qi**.

The others follow similarly.

Someone asks: *How do you know this is so?*
The answer: When the **liver qi** first moves in the **spring three months**, and the practice begins on a **Jiazi day and hour**, no other viscera’s **qi** will intrude. The **position** remains stable, allowing the **honorific-defensive qi** to circulate through the **body, meridians, and five viscera**. When the count is complete, it generates **Primordial Qi**, nourishing the body. The **most refined essence** is then stored in the **Primordial Palace**, where the **Five Phases’ generation and destruction** operate. The **qi** remains in its original position without dispersing.

At the **Wood’s sovereign season**, it is again applied to the **Primordial Palace**. The **green** is the **true qi of the liver**. After passing through the **five viscera**, the **honorific-defensive qi** circulates through the body, surging and emerging—its color differs, but only **pure green** remains. The other four **qi** follow the same principle.

The **five viscera each manifest their own colors**—this is the proof.

What is the **Golden Lock Method**?
Take **White Tiger’s meridian** at **262.5 units** as **Earth**, and **351 units** as **Metal**. **Metal** is the **true qi of the West**; **lead** is the **true qi of the White Tiger**. **Lock** means **closure**—closing the **true qi within the Yang**. **Mercury** is the **true essence of the Green Dragon**. The **most refined essence** originates from the **true qi of the Four Symbols**, thus having **no fixed form**.

Lead and mercury: only **Earth** can govern them. Thus, the **qi** takes form as **two qi** only when lead and mercury meet, and only then does the **treasure** form. Therefore, use **secret techniques** to secretly extract **Tiger Lead** and return it to the **Green Dragon’s position**. Lead is originally the **dwelling substance of the Tiger Palace**; returning it to the **Green Dragon’s Primordial Palace** prevents the **killing qi** from harming the **Primordial Spirit**. The **five viscera** then follow in order, resettling in the **Green Dragon’s Primordial Palace**.

Once the **lead** is obtained, it **controls mercury**; when **mercury** encounters **lead**, it naturally responds, forming the **treasure**—this is the **Golden Lock**.

What is the **Mysterious Pearl Sand**?
Take **true gold** of the **West’s color**—**twelve to fifteen liang**—but do not use **refined gold**. **Wood and Metal** must meet with **focused intent**; do not let the **yin-yang numbers** become disordered. The **Mysterious Pearl** is formed by the **Four Symbols**, thus composed of **Metal, Wood, Fire, and Earth**.

**Wood** is the **Dragon**; the **Dragon** is **Yang**.
**Metal** is the **Tiger**; the **Tiger** is **Yin**.
**Mercury** forms the **Dragon**, the **ultimate refinement within Yang**.
**Lead** forms the **Tiger**, the **ultimate refinement within Yin**.
Since **Yang contains Yin**, **lead** can **restrain mercury**, and **mercury** can **respond to lead**. When **lead and mercury harmonize**, the **Mysterious Vermilion** is complete.

First, use **secret techniques** to extract **true lead**, returning it to the **Green Dragon’s Primordial Palace** to form **cinnabar**. Thus, **mercury** naturally adheres to the **lead**.

Lead and mercury are the **essence of Dragon and Tiger**; when the **two qi** are obtained, the **lead** naturally gathers, and its name is the **Mysterious Pearl**.

How do we know this?
Because **mercury** submits to **true lead** within the **Primordial Palace**, and **Wood and Metal** are made to interact, receiving **Metal’s subjugation**. If the **mind stirs**, the **true qi** will descend and dissipate—it must be **deeply restrained**.

Thus, it cannot depart from its original position, and if it cannot leave, it **returns to the Primordial Palace**, merging with the **lead**—this is the **true convergence**.

In **twenty days**, the **Mysterious Pearl** forms within the **twelve-story pavilion**, below the **navel**, burning with extreme heat. Yet **Wood and Metal** must interact with **careful scrutiny**, restoring their **orifices** and belonging to **Earth**, embodying the **Five Phases**.

In **thirty days**, the **internal qi** becomes full, and the **form** is complete—sufficient to **usurp the creative power of Heaven and Earth for three hundred days**. This is **Jindan**.

When **ten months** have passed, it manifests beneath the **left rib**, its form like a **cherry**, its body like **blood**—this is the **true Golden Elixir**.

It **permanently dwells in the Primordial Palace**; the **qi abides in the spirit**, and the **refined essence ascends to the brain**—this is the **Flying Immortal**.

The **upper and lower passes** are fully opened, allowing the **elixir-qi** to circulate through the **meridians**, transforming the **bones**. In **three years**, one becomes a **True Person**.

Someone asks: *You say the thirty-day great work corresponds to three years—why specify thirty days? Now you say three years make a True Person—why?*
The answer: **Three years** encompass **one intercalary month**, when **Heaven and Earth’s qi** are full, leaving **accumulated surplus qi**. Three years can thus accumulate **thirty days**, establishing the **measurements of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon**.

Thus, **three hundred days** complete the **cyclical qi**, and **three years** make both **upper and lower** fully established—just as a human receives **Heaven and Earth’s dual qi** in the womb, **thirty days** suffice for the qi to fill, **three hundred days** for **creation and transformation** to form the body, and **three years** for full maturation into a person.

Therefore, **three years** encompass within them the **thirty-day great work**. A scholar who follows **Heaven and Earth’s ways** and accumulates the **surplus qi of thirty days within three years** achieves the highest attainment. Thus, the inherent qi of three years remains unlost.

Someone asks: *In youth, one often prioritizes profit over life, causing the **Primordial Spirit** to decay, the qi to be depleted, and the essence to weaken—how then can one practice the Dao in old age?*
The answer: **Old Yang seizing Minor Yin** extends life, while **Old Yin seizing Minor Yang** prevents death’s approach. Thus, if the aged obtain **Youthful Qi** and act accordingly, they can even **defy Heaven and Earth’s natural transformations**, achieving firmness and longevity.

Therefore, those who cultivate the Dao must know their **original essence at conception**—the **precise qi of their parents**. As for **lead and mercury** merging, forming the **Four Symbols**, entering the **Central Palace**, they then embody the **Five Phases**. When the **Five Phases’ qi is complete**, the **liver’s qi** enters the **Central Palace forty-five times**, the **heart’s qi** thirty-five times, and the **kidney’s qi** twenty-five times—totaling **one hundred and fifty**, the **True Qi**, refined through the **Three Primordials’ Divine Water**.

**Divine Water** is **bodily fluids**. Refined **three cycles**, it becomes a treasure for worldly dwelling. To achieve this without awaiting **sufficient spiritual qi**, relying on the **Three Primordials’ true numbers**, is the **mysterious essence**.

The **Three Primordials** are **Heaven, Earth, and Man**. Refining **Divine Water** with the **Three Primordials’ qi** as a treasure, permanently dwelling in the **elixir field**, firmly guarding the **Primordial Spirit**, allows one to **lengthen life through the Minor Yang’s way**.

The method states:
*The White Tiger’s head brings longevity;
Meeting True Lead extends years.
Even the lowly, mastering the Three Leads,
Can endure ten thousand springs.*

Thus, **Lead** is the **mother of all things**; **Mercury**, the **father**. When **Lead and Mercury unite**, they embody the **Five Phases**, refined by their proper numbers, becoming the **True Qi of the Three Primordials**—named **Divine Water**.

**Wood three, Fire two, Metal four, Water one**, **Earth five**—these are the **Five Phases’ true numbers**.

**Contract of the True Authentic Lord’s Words**

When voices clash in confusion,
The sacred teachings must surely falter.
How profound these mortals are—
Yet only the **True One** holds steadfast.

**Containing-Light** (子范德昭, *Zǐ Fàn Dé Zhāo*) said:
The greatest treasure of humankind is **Divine Qi** (神气, *Shénqì*).
When **Divine Qi** and **form** (形) part ways,
How can life be preserved?

If nails grow from flesh,
And nails are broken, flesh is wounded.
If **Divine Qi** does not permeate the body,
How can the **physical vessel** (形器, *xíngqì*) avoid decay and decline?

**Containing-Light** further stated:
Many seek the **Dao/Way** (道), yet few grasp its essence.
I have discerned six key points of misunderstanding:

**First is the practice of exhalation and inhalation** (吐纳, *tǔnà*).
The world declares exhalation and inhalation as supreme,
And breath as the pivotal method.
Yet they fail to recognize that within the throat itself
Lies the **Qi of natural inhalation and exhalation** (出入呼吸之气, *chūrù hūxī zhī qì*).
Why seek further aid from exhalation and inhalation?

Are exhalation and inhalation the same as natural breath?
If not, they become mere external techniques.
**Zhuangzi** said:
*"The common man breathes through the throat,
The sage breathes through the heels."*

**Dwelling-in-Truth** (栖真子, *Qī Zhēn Zǐ*) declared:
*"The **spirit** (神) lacks force yet **Qi** flows ceaselessly,
The **form** (形) is inherently still yet its function knows no bounds."*

**Laozi** said:
*"The gate of the mysterious female,
This is called the root of heaven and earth.
Endless as silk, ever present—
Using it, one need not exhaust."*

**Smoke-and-Ro** (烟萝子, *Yān Luó Zǐ*) said:
*"The foundation follows breath without hindrance,
Endless as silk, yet without strain—
Closing the throat to retain **Qi** disrupts the method."*

The *Paramitasutra* (《参同契》, *Shēn Tóng Mì*) states:
*"To ingest **Qi** and clear the intestines and stomach,
To exhale and inhale correctly—
This is the proper way, discarding the false."*

The *Primordial Dao Scripture* (《元道经》, *Yuán Dào Jīng*) teaches:
*"Drawing through the nose and exhaling through the mouth
Cannot disperse accumulated **Primordial Qi** (元气, *Yuánqì*),*
But only serves to dispel superficial cold or lingering heat.
Retaining **Qi** in the throat can alleviate hunger and weakness,
Guiding **Qi** can harmonize the skin and flesh."*

**Li Qixian** (李栖蟾, *Lǐ Qī Xiān*) said:
*"Ingesting the essence of the Seven Mansions and Two Scenes (七宿二景之精),
Retaining **Qi** like prenatal breathing—
This is not the true adept’s marvel."*

Observing the ancient masters’ discourse on the **Great Dao/Way** (大道),
I realize that those who emphasize exhalation and inhalation alone
Have missed its true nature.
Some claim their ability to not eat and remain light-bodied
Proves their intestines are free of dross,
And they can ascend to the celestial heights—
Yet they are already deceived.

The *Secrets of Ascending to Truth* (《登真隐诀》, *Dēng Zhēn Yǐn Jué*) states:
*"Prolonged life requires severing the **Qi of grains** (谷气, *gǔqì*),*
But severing grains does not guarantee longevity."*

**Ge the True Person** (葛真人, *Gě Zhēn Rén*) said:
*"Those who attain the **Dao/Way** eat nine meals a day without suffering,
Or go a year without food without harm—
Is abstaining from food truly the pinnacle of the **Dao/Way**?"*

**The Mystic Canon** (玄纲, *Xuángāng*) states:
*"Exhalation and inhalation refine the **viscera** (脏),
Guiding and drawing harmonize the **body** (体).*
Thus, the **sage’s** use of exhalation and inhalation is such."

**Second is the practice of consortial alchemy** (御女, *yùnǚ*).
In ancient times, **Yellow Emperor** wandered in **Red Water** (赤水, *Chìshuǐ*).
Shallow disciples hearing of this
Spread tales of **consortial alchemy with Golden Flower** (御女金华之道, *Yùnǚ Jīn Huá Zhī Dào*).
Those with superficial understanding eagerly believed,
Yet their **forms** withered and their **vitality** (产, *chǎn*) exhausted—
All without gain, yet they never awoke.

This **Dao/Way** has its origins.
In days past, there was **Master Pei** (裴君, *Péi Jūn*), a bold and virtuous man...

**Supporting Master Zī** desired to transform him with the **Dao/Way** of longevity, thus devising expedient and variable methods. **Master Pei**, having attained the **Dao/Way**, declared: *"I have long suffered from this, but fortunately corrected it early."*

From this, his teachings spread widely, giving rise to the **Five-Character** and **Three-Peak** doctrines, the **Yellow Scriptures** and **Red Boundaries** secrets—all to deceive the **true sages**, a most perilous matter.

**Master Táo** said: *"To seek immortality through consorts, to seek transcendence through elixirs—these dangers exceed those of water and fire, and their destruction is swifter than axes and blades."*

**The *True Edicts*** (*Zhēn Gāo*) states:
*"I have seen those who practiced consortial alchemy die; I have never seen those who practiced it live. Even if one’s **qi** and essence are unlost, this is still insufficient to attain true transformation. If injured, one risks the calamity of **tail-hearing**."*

Within our bodies lies an inherent **maiden**—those enamored with **lead and cinnabar** seek external consorts, unaware of seeking within themselves.

The **Scripture** says:
*"A maiden, graceful and radiant, veiled in celestial splendor,
Her resplendent halls gleam with eightfold majesty."*

The **Wild Man of Tàishān** declared:
*"The maiden’s attendants number in the hundreds;
Refining elixirs to return to the origin is no ordinary woman."*

Thus observed, the **kidneys** are the **ranked maidens** of the body. If one refines their **qi**, the **vitality** first flows from the waist and navel, filling the five **viscera**, ascending to connect with the **#1 crown and spine**, producing sound. Daily, one circulates **1,200 breaths**—these are the **1,200** so-called "consorts." Who among them could truly govern such **qi** as this?

**Master Yáng** said: *"The **Dao/Way** books of the world mislead many; opening diagrams and records only further confuse the **spirit**."* Truly well said!

Guāngchéngzǐ spoke:
*"Do not weary your form,
Do not agitate your essence,
Fewer thoughts, fewer desires—
This is the very essence of nurturing life.
This is indeed the key to learning the Dao/Way.*

*Thirdly, there are the杂术 (miscellaneous techniques) and傍门 (esoteric paths).*
The myriad arts of Nángōng’s minor ways number ten thousand branches—none of them the Great Dao/Way.

Some cultivate the *lingyá* (sacred sprouts) of the five viscera, merging the red, white, green, and yellow *qi* into the five viscera, then conjuring the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Tortoise, luminous essence, form and shadow, the seven *pò* (spirits), and the three *hún* (souls).
Some practice the *chénbù* (stepping on the Big Dipper) to train ascent to the heavens.
Some rely on the *liùjiǎ* (six celestial stems) and *liùchén* (six terrestrial branches) to ingest talismans and elixirs.
Some practice the *fángzhōng jiǔyī* (Nine-One Chambering Method).
Some employ *dǎoyǐn* (guided breathing) and *ànmó* (massage), bending, stretching, reclining, and rising—twisting their bodies day and night, causing their blood and *qi* to surge, boiling upward and downward, only to harm themselves in return.
Some fix their thoughts in inner contemplation, concentrating their minds to sever all thought, restraining their *pò* (spirits) and focusing their *shén* (spirit)—yet with every thought, a spirit emerges, and each day they weaken further.
Some erect altars for *jiào* (ritual exorcism), seeking blessings and protection, or refine alchemy, using mulberry bark as medicine, cinnabar and mercury as elixirs, gold cauldrons and porcelain furnaces, black lead and white tin, herbs, stones, and filth—recklessly combining the void with the nonexistent.
Some practice *tǔnà* (breath control) to draw in external pathogenic *qi*, causing their intestines to rumble and their stomachs to swell, thus injuring their true *qi*. Even tortoises, whose nature grants them longevity, do not achieve it through such *qi*-cultivation.
Some emulate the *Máo Nǚ* (Hairy Maiden) by ingesting elixirs—though the world has pine and cypress, no *Běi Nǚ* (Northern Maiden) has ever flown through the sky.
Some consume gold, stone, herbs, and wood to preserve their form, yet they do not understand the nature of gold, stone, herbs, and wood, nor the seasonal rhythms of what is auspicious or inauspicious.
Some seek purity and stillness, abandoning desire, refining their conduct, embracing emptiness and austerity, fasting and abstaining from grain—becoming like withered wood, their will like dead ashes—yet they fail to grasp the movement of Heaven and Earth.

All these are not what I call the Dao/Way.
They bear the name of *good learning* yet lack the practice of *Dao/Way*-cultivation. Seeking longevity, they rush toward the path of death—how pitiful!

The *Classic* says:
*'False Dao/Way nourishes the form,
True Dao/Way nourishes the spirit.'*
Now I shall speak of its truth.

*Fourthly, there is 神气 (spirit and qi).*
Some use this to guard the *sān guī yī* (Three Returns to One).

They know to maintain tranquility and self-cultivation, yet who knows that within tranquility lies nature?
They know to take emptiness as principle, yet who knows that within emptiness, nothing is excluded?
Merely surrendering one’s will to silence yields no benefit.
Practicing the Dao/Way means daily diminution—
Diminishing again and again,
Until one reaches *wuwei* (non-action).
*Wuwei* is not inaction;
It is establishing the method of *wuwei* and manifesting its function.

To observe this is to know the marvelous workings of spirit and *qi*.

**Qīzhēnzǐ** said:
*"Qi lies in its movement,
Spirit lies in its application.
Returning spirit to serve *qi*,
Resting without motion—
This is called stillness.
It is the same as entering *dìng* (meditative absorption)."*

The *Classic* says:
*"When *qi* enters the body, it is called life;
When spirit departs the body, it is called death.
Thus, the perfected one rests in spirit alone."*

*Tīng* (the heel) refers not to the navel below but to the *upper celestial gate*—difficult for mortals to enter. Only by emitting the luminous spirit without breathing does one attain it.

*Yuán* (the Primordial) is the *kūn* (Earth) Palace’s *qi*, ascending and congealing into form;
*Líng* (the Refined) is the complete *qiàn* (Heaven) spirit descending and merging into substance.
Thus, humans, like Heaven and Earth, receive *qi* from the *Xūhuáng* (Void Sovereign).
They ought to be able to share in Heaven and Earth’s longevity.

Therefore, the perfected one abides eternally with Heaven and Earth.
Spirit forms through *qi*,
*Qi* lingers through spirit—
When spirit and *qi* unite, the posterior heavens do not age.

**Yānlǔozǐ** said:
*"Within lies the White Primordial Sovereign,
His flesh as pure as congealed snow.*
The Primordial Sovereign is the manifestation of the refined spirit-*qi*.
Those who learn the Dao/Way and recognize him
Have already surpassed half the path.

How does one recognize him?"*

「He said: *"Cultivate and ponder the White *Qi*,*
from the navel downward to the waist, to the spine,
ascending through the *níwán* (Brain of Mud) to its summit—
this is the true method of refining the elixir,*
the true application of the Primordial *Qi*."*

*"Thus, one clears and purifies the *níwán* (Brain of Mud),
settles and dwells the *dānlíng* (Elixir Spirit),
so that the Three do not wander forth,
and the Six do not intrude.*

*The Three—what are they?*
The inner *qi* does not escape,
the outer *qi* does not enter,
yet this is not the closure of *qi*.
*The Six—what are they?*
The eyes do not gaze recklessly,
the ears do not listen wantonly,
the mouth does not speak or savor indiscriminately,
the body does not touch or receive in vain,
the nose does not inhale fragrance or foulness without measure,
the mind does not conceive or ponder in error.
Thus, external affairs do not intrude,
and the inner *qi* is not stolen by them."*

*The Eight Harmful Extremes are:*
Hunger, satiation, toil, ease,
wind, cold, heat, dampness—
these injure the True *Qi*, and then illness arises.

*The Fifth Principle states:*
*"The True One refines essence and disperses form."*

*Ancient sages of the highest attainment possessed the method of dispersing form and scattering shadow—*
how did they achieve it?
This is the method of *jīnshuǐ* (Metal-Water) dispersion of form.

*Now, the sun’s center, the water’s depths, and the mirror’s surface*
all can disperse form—
*is this not so?*
When form is dispersed by the sun,
the Primordial Spirit emerges from the Six *Jiǎ* (Heavenly Stems) in a single day,
and at that moment,
one must not be alarmed.

*He who recognizes the *Xuánzhū* (Mysterious Pearl)*
knows the *fǎ* (Law) of it.
Just as the *Law* of winter solstice’s thunder,
when the time is ripe, success is achieved—
fulfilling the practice and reaching the Upper Pure (清界).

*The Sixth Principle states:*
*"The Mysterious One refines spirit and forms the embryo."*

*Liú Gēn* (Surname Root) said:
*"Congeal into the *dāntián* (Elixir Field),
and emerge as a child—
this is the method of forming the embryo."*

*Thus, essence has its master,*
*qi* has its source,
breathing softly and softly,
harmonizing with nature—
then the embryo is formed, and the True One is complete.*

*Now, the clam absorbs the moon’s luminous *qi* yet forms a pearl within its belly—*
is this not the refinement of its spirit after death?
Hence, refining *qi* to form a body is called the *Xiānrén* (Immortal);
refining the Immortal to form a body is called the *Zhēnrén* (True Person);
refining the True One to form a body is called the *Jiùrén* (Ancient Person);
refining the Sage to form a body is called the *Shénrén* (Divine Person).

*The Classic says:*
*"Boundless, drifting in the Mysterious Ford,*
naturally refining my spirit."*

*Zhào Dàxìn* (Surname Great Faith) said:
*"A single treasure returns the Dragon Light to the *zhēngshì* (Struggle Chamber)—
this is the foundation of preserving the marvelous."*

*Now, those who refine *qi* to form a body*
are practitioners of *dǎoyǎng* (Guiding and Nourishing),
who may attain a lifespan of a thousand years or a hundred years,
yet only retain their old form—
they never truly grasp the Dao/Way.*

*Hence, the *Hàotiān Shī* (Celestial Sovereign Master) said:*
*"Longevity like that of tortoises and cranes*
is not the mark of a true Daoist Immortal."*

*In the past, the Master of Azure Essence lived three thousand years,*
and the *Cǎinǚ* (Colored Maiden) asked *Péngzǔ* (Surname Ancestor):
*"Is this man an Immortal?"*
*Péngzǔ* replied:
*"A practitioner of Guiding and Nourishing."*

*The Dragon masters the formation of pearls—*
when its pearls emerge, its body retreats,
and its name is changed to *Tiānlóng* (Celestial Dragon).
*High True Ones* (高真) cultivate likewise as Dragons.
*Tiānzhēn* (Celestial True Ones) refine their body, their spirit, and their *qi*;
though their transformations are beyond measure,
they are still bound by the *qìxiàng* (subtle material form).
*Wánghù Shān* (Surname House Mountain) has the *Tuìgǔ Dòng* (Retreating Bone Cave),
where those who attain the Dao ascend and shed their mortal frames.
*For those with form, ascending to Heaven is not possible,*
yet then the refined body is still constrained by *qìxiàng*.
*It dies, abandoning the body passed down from its parents—*
how could such a form endure long?
*Though long-lived, it has not yet escaped the realm of yin-yang,*
nor has it entered the boundless formlessness.*

*When the Dao is first attained,*
one advances to the One Heaven (一天),
and to the Nine Heavens of Nine Hundred Million Years (九百万岁一天).
*Each advance to a Heaven doubles one’s lifespan.*
*When the lifespan reaches twentyfold,*
the cultivation and refinement are complete.
*Then one ascends to the realm of the Formless,*
and upon reaching *Tiānlóng Dì* (Celestial Dragon Emperor) and *Luòjué Chángtiān* (Dragon Roar Long Heaven),
one’s lifespan spans
one thousand two hundred seventy-nine thousand seven hundred seventy-five billion five thousand two hundred years—
yet still, one remains within the transformations of yin and yang,
not yet able to enter the Formless.*

*Ānqīshēng* (Surname Peaceful Life) rode upon a swift *lín* (Unicorn)
and met the Three Sovereigns and the Divine Old Woman (神姥),
asking about the calamity of the *Yáng* (Yang) Nine Hundred and Six.
*The Divine Old Woman said:*
*"When yin and yang exhaust their cycles,*
the waters and fires will be consumed by flames,
and the Three Realms of Heaven and Earth will perish in transformation—
only the *Jiān-Yáng* (Pure Yang), *Jīnquē* (Golden Threshold), *Kūn-Gōng* (Earth Palace), and *Míngtáng* (Bright Hall) will remain.
*Thus, beyond the Ten True Ones (十真),*
one returns to the *Jīnquē* (Golden Threshold),
and the Great Force Divine King (大力神王) returns to the *Míngtáng* (Bright Hall).
*Pure Yang endures unbroken,*
*Pure Yin does not dissolve—*
this is the state of refinement."*

*How can one refine to the point of surpassing the Ten True Ones?*
*He said:*
*"Refining form does not rely on *qi*,
refining *qi* does not rely on form—
its *qi* can be seen,
yet its form cannot be glimpsed.*
*Exhaling does not rely on *qi*,
inhaling does not rely on breath—
entering the Formless without causing transformations,*
*the subtle material forms cannot constrain it.*
*This is the same as the Primordial Sovereign and the Upper True One (上真)."*

**Chapter on Cultivating the True:**

*"Guide and open the *Gǔhǎi* (Valley Sea),
adjust and harmonize the *shénshè* (Spiritual Abode);
dedicate the mind to the True One,
quietly observe the transformations."*

*Jiùyōuzǐ* (Surname Wandering Child) said:
*"Humans possess a Primordial Head with nine apertures (窍),
above mirroring the Nine Heavens,
below following the Nine Earths.*
*The body has nine apertures,*
and also the Five Cities (五城), Twelve Towers (十二楼), Golden Hall and Jade Palace (金堂琼宫),
where the spirit dwells.*

*The Nine Palaces of the Supreme One (九宫太一)—*
what does this mean?
*Dedicate the mind to the True One,*
and only preserve the One Official (一官),
then it will dissolve and manifest clearly.
*Thus, the Hundred Evils are automatically dispelled,*
and all blessings come in abundance.*

*By applying this method,*
I possess the Six *Qi* Prescriptions (六气之方) and the Essentials for Cultivating the Body (修身之旨):*

- *Swallowing (咽) governs the lungs,*
- *Hawking (呵) governs the heart,*
- *Sighing (嘘) governs the liver,*
- *Inhaling (呼) governs the spleen,*
- *Blowing (吹) governs the kidneys,*
- *Panting (嘻) governs the *Sānjiāo* (Triple Burner).

*The *Sānjiāo* (Triple Burner)*
is the *fǎxiàng* (Law-Image) of the Thirty-Six *Qi*,
distributed throughout the Five Zang (solid organs) and Six Fǔ (hollow organs),
connecting and guiding the *Shuǐgǔ* (Water-Grain) Sea,
adjusting and harmonizing the *xíngshén* (Form-Spirit) Abode.

*He who desires to nourish his spirit*
must first nourish his *qi*,
*he who desires to nourish his *qi***
must first nourish his brain,
*he who desires to nourish his brain*
must first nourish his essence,
*he who desires to nourish his essence*
must first nourish his blood,
*he who desires to nourish his blood*
must first nourish his saliva,
*he who desires to nourish his saliva*
must first nourish his fluids—
*then, and only then, can it be done."*

「The Nine Returns and Seven Reversals—what are they?

In broad terms, they span a year,
in narrow terms, a single day.
With one cycle of day and night,
the heavens descend and the earth ascends.

Thus, from *Yín* (寅) to *Shēn* (申),
these are the Seven Reversals.
From *Shēn* (申) to *Kūn* (坤),
these are the Nine Returns.

The essentials of the *Shénxiān* (Immortal Sage)
lie in *cúnxiǎng* (存想).
*Cún* (存) means preserving one’s own spirit,
*xiǎng* (想) means closing the eyes to see its form,
and gathering the mind to see its mind.
Keep the eyes from straying from the body,
and the body from straying from the spirit—
this is the gradual way of *cúnxiǎng*.

Next, one must cultivate *xìng* (性).
The way of cultivating *xìng* is to minimize labor,
yet not to extremes—
nor to force what the body cannot bear.

In eating and drinking, one should take little,
but not all at once.
Always maintain the balance of hunger within satiety,
and satiety within hunger—
this is the art of nourishing life well.

Thus, eat when first hungry,
drink when first thirsty,
and after meals, walk and massage the abdomen—
do this a hundred times.

At night, close the *Earth’s Gate* (地之户),
otherwise, true *qi* will dissipate,
and malevolent forces will enter from without.

Bend the knees and lie down,
rest the head on the right arm while sleeping—
this is called *Jíxiáng* (吉祥, Auspicious).

In spring and summer, rise early,
in autumn and winter, rise late.
When rising early, do not precede the *yīngwǔ* (鹦呜, mythical bird’s cry);
when rising late, do not delay past sunrise.

Always, upon hearing *yīngwǔ* (鹦呜),
reflect that within your body there is a man,
three inches tall, clad in black,
who stands upright.
With prolonged reflection,
you may come to see beyond ten thousand *lǐ* (里, leagues).

Who among us does not know
there are things to be avoided?

On *huìrì* (晦日, last day of the lunar month), do not sing,
on *shuòrì* (朔日, new moon), do not laugh.
Before and after *sōuchōu* (搜勿, critical times),
do not gaze upon the sun, moon, or stars,
nor look toward the northwest.
Do not drive recklessly in a carriage,
nor gallop horses wildly.
Do not leap over wells,
nor cross the paths of *áo* (鳌, mythical tortoises).
Keep your pillow low,
do not spit far,
sleep without raising the bedding,
and avoid sitting where winds and frosts strike—
these are but preliminary measures
for attaining the ultimate *xiūzhēn* (修真, cultivation of the True).

I have heard from the *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Sage):
*"The *qi* mirrors the cosmos,
its transformations are boundless and unfathomable.
The *yánglóng* (阳龙, Yang Dragon) and *yīnhǔ* (阴虎, Yin Tiger)
interchange, refining *shùyè* (木液, Wood Elixir) into *jīn jīng* (金精, Metal Essence).
Above, it ascends to the *Níwán* (泥丸, Mud Pill),
below, it flows into the *Dāntián* (丹田, Elixir Field).
It gathers the Five *Shí* (石, Stones) to nourish the Hundred *Shén* (神, Spirits).
When the inner elixir is complete,
the outer elixir responds;
but if the outer elixir responds
while the inner elixir is still insufficient,
then ascent is not yet possible."*

Some say that when the *jīn shēng yù zhèn* (金声玉振, Golden Voice and Jade Resonance) occur,
it is a sign that the Dao is nearing fulfillment.

The *Wù Zhēn Piān* (悟真篇, Awakening to the True Scripture)
follows the *Yellow Path* (黄道),
where *Yīn* (阴) is diminished and *Yáng* (阳) is perfected,
and the *Xuánzhū* (玄珠, Mysterious Pearl) takes form,
while *Tàiyī* (太一, Supreme Unity) returns to its origin.

*Zhāng Píngshū* (张平叔), surnamed *Bǒduān* (伯端),
a man of *Tiāntái* (天台),
said:
*"The Dao has two aspects.
Refining the Five *Yá* (芽, Sprouts) of *qi*,
ingesting the Seven *Yào* (曜, Luminaries’ lights),
directing reflection and massage,
absorbing the pure and expelling the turbid,
reciting *sūtras* and holding *dhāraṇīs*,
swallowing water and符 (*fú*, talismans),
knocking the teeth to gather the spirit,
abstaining from flesh and fasting,
preserving the spirit and closing the breath,
supplementing the brain and returning the essence—
and further, consuming herbs and minerals,
refining *jīnshí* (金石, metals and stones)—
these are the methods of *huàhuà yǒuwéi* (幻化有为, illusory transformations with deliberate action),
what is called *easy to encounter but difficult to attain*.
Even the practice of *bìxī* (闭息, breath retention)
entails entering *dìng* (定, meditation) and exiting *shén* (神, spirit),
its principle belonging to pure *Yīn* (阴).
Its dwelling is difficult to secure,
and it cannot avoid the use of artificial methods.
How could one thus attain
the fruit of *zìrán wúlòu* (自然无漏, spontaneous and leak-free)?
Could they truly reverse the *Yáng* (阳) and transform the bones,
ascending to the heavens?"*

My method of the *Nine Transformations of Golden Elixir* (九转金液还丹)
lies in penetrating *Yīn* and *Yáng*,
understanding *zàohuà* (造化, Creation and Transformation),
pursuing the Two *Qi* (二气) along the *Yellow Path*,
uniting the Three *Xìng* (三性, natures) in the *Yuángōng* (元宫, Primordial Palace),
and refining the Five *Phases* (五行),
harmonizing the Four *Xiàng* (四象, Symbols).
The *Lóng yīn Hǔ xiào* (龙吟虎啸, Dragon’s Roar and Tiger’s Howl)
rise in chorus and response,
the *Yùdǐng* (玉鼎, Jade Cauldron) steams with warmth,
and the *Jīn lú* (金炉, Metal Furnace) blazes with fire—
thus, the *Xuánzhū* (玄珠, Mysterious Pearl) takes form,
and *Tàiyī* (太一, Supreme Unity) returns to its origin.

In practice, this is done swiftly.
Yet guarding against peril and danger
lies in caution regarding *nìshùn* (逆顺, contrary and proper),
and in the careful *chōutiān* (抽添, withdrawal and addition).
Nurturing the *Zhèng* (正, True) and maintaining *Yǐng* (盈, fullness)
lies in caution regarding *shǒucí péiyī* (守雌抱一, preserving the receptive and embracing the One).
Thus, the *Yáng* (阳) *shēng* (生, life-giving) *qi* is fostered,
the *Yīn* (阴) *killing* (杀) form is diminished.
When the seasons are complete,
the body is cast off and the spirit transformed.

Yet scholars merely regard *qiān* (铅, lead) and *gǒng* (汞, mercury) as the Two *Qi*,
the Five Zang as the Five *Phases*,
the *heart* (心) and *kidneys* (肾) as *Kǎn-Lǐ* (坎离, Water and Fire),
the *liver* (肝) and *lungs* (肺) as *Lóng-Hǔ* (龙虎, Dragon and Tiger),
the *shénqi* (神气, spiritual *qi*) as *Zǐmǔ* (子母, Male and Female),
and the *jīn* (津, fluids) and *jīng* (精, essence) as *qiān-gǒng* (铅汞, lead and mercury).
They do not grasp the principles of *fúdīn* (浮沉, rising and sinking),
nor the subtleties of *bīnzhǔ* (宾主, guest and host).
How can they differ
from those who treat others as their own kin?

This is surely because they fail to perceive
the profound interplay of *Metal* (金) and *Wood* (木),
nor the essential harmony of *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳).
Thus, they cause the *sun* (日) and *moon* (月) to stray from the Dao,
and lead *qiān-gǒng* (铅汞, lead and mercury) to wander from their proper furnaces.
To hope for the completion of the elixir,
is that not difficult?

Observe the many scriptures,
all of which state:
*"The sun is the soul, the moon the spirit,
the *Gēng-Hǔ* (庚虎, Metal Tiger) and *Jiǎ-Lóng* (甲龙, Wood Dragon),
*shuǐyín* (水银, mercury) and *zhūshā* (朱砂, cinnabar),
*báijīn* (白金, white metal) and *hēiqiān* (黑铅, black lead),
*Kǎn* (坎, Water) as male, *Lǐ* (离, Fire) as female,
congealing into *Golden Elixir*—
yet they do not explain
what the true *lead* (真铅) and true *mercury* (真汞) are."*

Now I present five verses to clarify:

1.
*"Refine the Three *Huáng* (黄, Yellows) in seclusion,*
*and tend to the Four *Shén* (神, Spirits)—*
*to seek herbs and minerals is not the true path.*
*When *Yīn-Yáng* (阴阳) align in their proper places,*
*the Eight *Bā* (八, Eights) naturally unite.*
*The *Tán* (潭, Pool) glows red as *Yīn* (阴) vanishes,*
*and the *Mountain’s* (山头) white moon reveals fresh elixir.*
*Men fail to recognize true *lead* and *mercury*—*
*not the common *shuǐyín* (水银) or *shā* (砂, sand)."*

2.
*"All men possess the elixir of longevity,*
*yet through ignorance, they discard it.*
*When *Sweet Dew* (甘露) descends,*
*the heavens and earth unite,*
*and when *Yellow Sprouts* (黄芽) emerge,*
*Water and Fire intermingle.*
*The *well frog* (井蛙) would say there is no *Dragon’s Lair* (龙窟),*
*and the *barred yīngwǔ* (篱鹦) would not know of the *Phoenix’s Nest* (凤巢).*
*When the elixir is ready,*
*gold fills the house naturally—*
*why seek herbs or burn reeds?"*

3.
*"They do not know the inverted transformations within the Mysterious,*
*nor how fire nurtures the lotus.*
*They force the *White Tiger* (白虎) to return home,*
*and produce a *Bright Pearl* (明珠) like the full moon.*
*They guard the elixir in the furnace,*
*watching the fire’s temper—*
*yet only when meditating on the spirit*
*does it naturally settle.*
*When all *Yīn* (阴) is diminished,*
*the elixir ripens,*
*and leaps free from the mundane cage—*
*this is no great difficulty."*

4.
*"To know where the elixir is born,*
*look to the southwest—*
*that is its native land.*
*When *lead* (铅) meets *Guǐ* (癸, the tenth Heavenly Stem),*
*it must be gathered swiftly;*
*when *gold* (金) encounters *wàngyuǎn* (望远, distant gazing),*
*it cannot be taken lightly.*
*Return it to the *Earth’s Cauldron* (土釜) and seal it tightly,*
*then place it in the *flowing pearl* (流珠) to combine properly."*

The elixir weighs one *cāty* (斤) yet requires two *bā* (八)—
adjust the fire’s temper by balancing *Yīn* and *Yang*.

5.
*"Three-five-one-all-three"*—three characters,
rarely understood by the wise of past and present.
Bundle three, add two from the south to make five,
one from the north, four from the west combine.
*Wù* and *Jǐ* (戊己) return to their native *shēng* numbers—five.
The Three Families meet, and a child is born.
This child holds the true *qi*—
in ten months, the embryo rounds, establishing the sacred foundation.

*Píngshū* (平叔) deemed it incomplete,
so he appended a short chapter, adding its essence.

The first:
When the sun dwells in *Lí* (离) yet turns to *Yīn*,
and *Kǎn* (坎) aligns with the *Chán gōng* (蟾宫), it becomes *Yang*.
Those who fail to grasp this inverted meaning
should not presume their narrow views as profound discourse.

The second:
The *guà* (卦) sets forth symbols like ritual forms—
when the symbol is obtained, words fade, and meaning becomes clear.
Later deluded disciples cling only to the forms,
yet chase *guàqì* (卦气) in vain, hoping for ascension.

The third:
Swallowing saliva and inhaling *qi* is the human path—
only with substance can all things be born.
If the cauldron lacks the true seed,
it is like fierce fire boiling an empty pot.

The fourth:
On *Huàyuè* (华岳) Mountain, a雄 tiger roars,
while beneath the *Fúsāng* (扶桑) sea, a *cīlóng* (牝龙) bellows.
The *Huángpó* (黄婆) herself arranges their union,
binding them as husband and wife in one mind.

The fifth:
Not knowing the *Yang* essence and its host-guest roles,
who can distinguish between distant and intimate?
Sealing the chamber yet leaving the *wèixué* (尾问穴) open—
how many have been misled by this error?

The sixth:
Do not use common *qiān* (铅)—
even true *qiān* must be discarded.
This is the profound secret of using *qiān*:
using it yet not using it—this is the genuine truth.

The seventh:
The *White Tiger* (白虎) of the West Mountain rages wildly,
while the *Qīnglóng* (青龙) of the Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.
Seize them both to fight to the death,
and they transform into a single mass of *zǐjīn shuāng* (紫金霜).

The eighth:
When bamboo breaks, patch it with bamboo—
covering the chick requires an egg.
All other efforts are in vain—
how can they compare to true *qiān* merging with the sacred mechanism?

The ninth:
The *Snow Mountain* (雪山) offers a fine brew—
pour it into the *Yīn-Yáng* furnace of transformation.
If you reach the northwest of *Kūnlún* (昆仑),
only then will you meet *Má Gū* (麻姑) as Zhang Qian did.

The tenth:
On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the *Chán* (蟾) glow—
this is when *Jīn* essence thrives at its peak.
When *Yī* (一, the first *Yang*) just begins to rise,
seize the fire—do not delay.

The eleventh:
The *Xuán* (玄) *Tà* (牝) Gate is known to none—
pointing to mouths and noses is mere folly.
Though *Liáo Jūn* (饶君) perfected breathing for millennia,
how could he ever attain the *Jīnwū* (金乌) and *Gāngtù* (钢兔)?

The twelfth:
Turn the *sǐhù* (死户) into *shēnghù* (生户),
do not cling to *shēngmén* (生门) as *sǐmén* (死门).
If you grasp the killing mechanism and reverse it,
only then will you know that harm harbors birth.

The thirteenth:
When the moon hangs half-bright in the sky,
the *lóng* (龙) and *hǔ* (虎) roars are heard early.
Then, fortify your resolve to refine the two *bā* (八)—
within one *shí* (时辰), the elixir will be complete.

The fourteenth:
Within the *yǎn yuè lú* (偃月炉), jade buds sprout,
while *zhūshā* (朱砂) and *shuǐyín* (水银) settle evenly.
Only after blending in the fire’s embrace
does the *huángyá* (黄芽) begin to grow.

The fifteenth:
Dreaming of visiting *Xīhuá* (西华) in the ninth heaven,
clearly instructed in the *Xuán* (玄) scriptures.
Though its essence is simple, its intent is profound—
it teaches only the refining of *gǒng* (汞) and *qiān* (铅).

The sixteenth:
After the *Huápó* (华池) banquet, the moon’s light congeals,
riding a *Jīnlóng* (金龙) to visit *Zǐwēi* (紫微).
From then on, all immortals recognize each other,
and the tides of sea and valleys shift at will.

The seventeenth:
The *Hèchì* (赫赤) *Jīndān* (金丹) completes in a day—
listen to the ancient immortals’ poetry for truth.
If they speak of nine years or three,
those are mere baseless claims of time.

The eighteenth:
*Tài Yī* (太一) says:
The woman wears green robes,
the man dons white silk.
Seeing them is forbidden,
using them renders them invisible.
If husband and wife meet,
their affection lingers naturally.

The furnace’s flames burn crimson red—
the True Person emerges on his own.

**Chapter Eighteen of *Dàoshū* concludes** #1—
*"Jíyào"* reads *"Dá"* instead of *"lián"* #2.
*"Jíyào"* reads *"zhuàng"* instead of *"běi"* #3.
*"Jíyào"* reads *"rú"* instead of *"zhī"* #4.
*"Jiānbiàn"* is *"biànjiān"* in *"Jíyào"* #5.
*"Jiān"* is *"huán"* in *"Jíyào"* #6.

**Chapter Nineteen: From *Yóuzǐ Zēngxiè’s* Collection**
**The *Tóngzhēn* (洞真) Scripture**

Five *yá* (芽) of *Tóngzhēn* remain preserved,
employing the Six *Qì* (气).
Serene and thoughtless, the spirit guards its place.

To the True Person, it says:
From the day of *Yuánmìng* (元命) and *Tàisuì* (太岁),
after the hour of *Zǐ* (子) and before *Wǔ* (午),
squat in a quiet chamber,
the mind clear as still water,
thoughtless and carefree—
then bind the teeth and strike the *Tiāngǔ* (天鼓) thirty-six times,
imagine my head,
shade it with my *huágài* (华盖),
sit firm upon *jiǎoxiàn* (狡现),
with the Azure Dragon to my left,
the White Tiger to my right,
the Vermilion Bird before me,
the Dark Turtle behind.
Bow to the four directions,
resting my hands upon my knees,
shaking my navel—
three times to the left, seven to the right—
warm my palms and wipe my face and ears,
doing this three times according to the hour.
A thousand days, and the spirit will emerge from the crown.

If fearful, imagine returning—
first, imagine myself seated within five colored divine clouds,
the clouds covering my crown.
When settled, silently pray:
*"Five *qì* blend and generate,
the supreme essence of *Xuánshàng* (玄上),
filling the Five *Zàng* (藏),
illuminating the Six *Yuàn* (院) clearly.
Internally infused, externally dispersed—
both exterior and interior purified,
impurities banished, the True welcomed.
I fly to *Tàilíng* (太灵)."*

After praying, first absorb the *Qīngyáng* (青阳) essence,
the Azure God’s clouds,
swallowing saliva nine times,
forming nine divine beings,
like the planet Jupiter,
wearing jade belts, green robes, and crowns,
placed within the liver,
facing the spirit and seated,
breathing in rhythm with the hour.

Next, absorb the *Língdān* (灵丹) essence,
the Vermilion God’s clouds,
swallowing saliva eight times,
forming eight divine beings,
like the planet Mars,
wearing jade belts, red robes, and crowns,
placed within the heart,
facing the spirit and seated,
breathing in rhythm with the hour.

Next, absorb the *Jīnpò* (金魄) essence,
the White God’s clouds,
swallowing saliva six times,
forming six divine beings,
like the planet Venus,
wearing jade belts, white robes, and crowns,
placed within the lungs,
facing the spirit and seated,
breathing in rhythm with the hour.

Next, absorb the *Xuányào* (玄曜) essence,
the Black God’s clouds,
swallowing saliva five times,
forming five divine beings,
like the planet Mercury,
wearing jade belts, black robes, and crowns,
placed within the *Jiānggōng* (绛宫),
piercing the two *pángguāng* (膀胱),
entering the *Wěiwèn* (尾问),
rising to the *jiājí* (夹脊),
spread within the two kidneys—
three to the left, two to the right—
facing the spirit and seated,
breathing in rhythm with the hour.

At *Wǔ* (午), exhale sharply; at *Mǎo* (卯), inhale gently;
at *Yǒu* (酉), swallow.

After each breath-work,
close the *qì*,
warm the palms and wipe the face until hot,
cover the ears with both hands so as not to hear sound,
and strike the *Tiāngǔ* thirty-six times.
The *Tiāngǔ* is the *yùzhěn gǔ* (玉枕骨).

After each breath-work,
tap the teeth three times,
swallow three times, exhale three times—
all in reverse sounds.

Then blow into the kidneys,
exhale sharply at the heart,
inhale gently at the liver,
swallow at the lungs,
exhale at the *Sānjiāo* (三焦),
exhale at the spleen—
swallowing twice to purge and discharge.
First, imagine the left eye emitting the sun,
the right eye emitting the moon—
each nine inches wide,
located above the ears,
named the *Liùhé Gāochuāng* (六合高窗).

When settled, silently pray:
*"Supreme *Xuányī* (玄一),
the Nine Sovereigns exhale essence,
three, five, seven transformations,
piercing the dark and obscure,
the sun and moon cast their light,
reaching the *Shéntíng* (神庭),
illuminating the *Liùhé*,
the *Tàiyī* (太一) *Huánglíng* (黄灵),
the Emperor’s decree inscribed—
golden script unshaken,
the Five Elders bearing talismans,
heaven and earth in eternal harmony.
Grant me immortality,
attaining the True Spirit,
repelling ten thousand evils,
banishing calamity and harm,
ascending to the Celestial Sovereign,
returning to youth, reborn as an infant—
the Great Emperor’s decree,
a hundred spirits in reverent obedience."*

After praying,
absorb the sun and moon,
swallowing saliva twenty-seven times per breath,
forming twenty-seven Imperial Lords:
Nine Imperial Lords descend into the *Jiānggōng*,
piercing the *Wěiwèn*,
rising to the *Níwán Guān* (泥丸关);
Nine Imperial Lords are spread within the *Zhōngguān* (中关);
Nine Imperial Lords descend through the *Jiānggōng*,
spread within the *Xiàguān* (下关)—
their spirits all wearing purple crowns and robes.

What are the Three Passes?
The brain, the heart, the navel.

Let the sun and moon permeate the body,
internally reaching the *Níwán*,
descending to the Five *Zàng*,
illuminating both interior and exterior—
as if the body merges with the light of sun and moon.

After some time,
tap the teeth nine times,
exhaling with a *"xī"* sound twenty-five times.

Each day, in sitting or lying,
keep in mind twenty-four stars,
each larger than an inch,
linked as if connected,
and within the stars, a man—
these are the twenty-four stars,
like a newborn babe without clothing.

Then the twenty-four stars exhale from the center,
circling the body once outside.

Pray:
*"Twenty-four True Ones,
returning to the *Huángtíng* (黄庭),
mouth exhaling yellow *qì*,
irrigating my *Mìngmén* (命门),
a thousand essences subdued #1,
a hundred spirits receiving spirit,
strengthening my bones,
soothing my soul and *pò*,
the Five *Zàng* receiving talismans,
heaven and earth leaning toward me."*

After praying,
absorb the twenty-four stars twice,
swallowing saliva twenty-four times per breath.

Whenever swallowing,
feel one star enter the mouth,
descending to below the navel,
then sense the star’s light transform into twenty-four True Persons,
each exhaling yellow *qì* like smoke,
spread below the navel,
dense and penetrating both interior and exterior.

After a long while, one employs the *hē* (呼) and *tǔ* (吐) techniques fifteen times.

In all cases of using *hē* (呵), *xū* (嘘), *yàn* (咽), *xī* (嘻), *hū* (呼), and *chuī* (吹), once completed, exhale the turbid *qì* ten times, imagining its form as the Five Colors, and likewise imagining one’s own body.

From the *Chóngzhēn Piān* (崇真篇):
*"Bing-Ding (丙丁) as nature, Ren-Gui (壬癸) as fate;
Study and exhaust principle, then recognize the True Way."*

The *Chóngzhēn Zǐ* (崇真子) Jin Dao Cheng (晋道成) said:
*"Nurturing the Three while holding to the One—this is the essence of Daoist practice.
What are the Three? They are *jīng* (精), *qì* (氣), and *shén* (神)—what I call the Three True Treasures.
What is the One to be held? It is the embrace and safeguarding of the Original Yang True *qì* (元阳真气).

The *shén* originates in the heart, belonging to the Southern Fire of Bing-Ding (丙丁).
Within the heart lies *xìng* (性), which belongs to Yang.
The kidneys generate the Original Yang True *qì*, which, when released, becomes *jīng* (精), and when conserved, becomes True *qì*, belonging to the Northern Water of Ren-Gui (壬癸).
Water is fate, and fate belongs to Yin.

He who understands the Way of nurturing the Three while holding to the One—
making *qì* guard *jīng*, *jīng* guard *shén*, and *shén* guard *qì*—
over time attains steadfast *shén* and harmonious *qì*, and thus the Dao of Transcendence is achieved.

For women, focus unwaveringly within the breast and beneath the floating skin,
supplementing True *qì* fully over a decade, and their practice will equal that of men.

Its marvel lies in:
the heart thinking of nothing,
the ears hearing nothing,
the eyes seeing nothing,
a single mind devoted to stillness,
diligence and perseverance in practice—
then cold and heat will not assail,
wasps and scorpions will not poison,
birds of prey will not strike,
wild beasts will not bite.
One’s complexion returns to that of a child,
one’s strength rivals that of a tiger or rhinoceros.
The seven orifices become piercingly clear,
night vision becomes as bright as day.
The heart’s insight awakens,
Dao *qì* returns on its own.
With *hē* and *chuī*, one can heal sickness;
with *yīng* (嘤) and *tǔ* (吐), one can command ghosts and spirits.

Thus, the *shén* ascends to the lofty heavens.
What distance is there to the *Qīngdū Bǎn Yuàn* (清都板苑)?"

「The *Return to the True* Chapter:
The *Xūgǔ* (虚谷, Void Valley) probes the mysteries, and measures their source;
The true nature is inwardly restored, and life’s essence returns to its root.

The *Xūgǔ* adept, Master Liuliè (烈, *Lìe*), says:
When the undifferentiated and the differentiated are already distinct,
When clarity and turbidity have been separated—
Then you are the spirit of the ten thousand things,
And I possess the singular excellence of the One Origin.
This excellence is inherently free from death and decay, is it not?
Yet its end comes from self-inflicted annihilation, is it not?

Amidst the scramble for fame and gain like ants,
Amidst the rise of quarrels like swarms of bees—
At this juncture, if one seeks to restore the true nature and return to the root,
To blunt sharpness and disperse chaos,
To dwell in peace and take joy in one’s work,
Then the singular spirit rests, and all realms are forgotten—
This is indeed the Dao!

Only with the blade of wisdom can one sever the bonds of *troubles* (烦恼, *fánnǎo*).

Thus, though sweet words and clever smiles may be employed,
The resolve of the *Lìeshì* (烈士, ardent warrior) cannot be swayed;
Though arched brows and plump cheeks may be displayed,
The gaze of the *Gāoshì* (高士, noble recluse) cannot be ensnared.

So, abandoning that and embracing this,
Understanding matter through the body’s awareness,
One must attain utter clarity and profound stillness,
To forget all attachments.

Hence, when the *shén* (神, spirit) transforms the *qì* (氣),
And the *qì* (氣) shapes the *xíng* (形, form),
This is the culmination of the *Xúnwěi* (穷委, exhausted retreat);
When the spirit illuminates itself and its light shines forth,
This is the flow of the marvelous use.

Beyond the dim and distant,
Within the hazy and indistinct—
Here lies the life’s journey of the Kunlun *Xūgǔ* (虚谷, Void Valley).

I have two paths, continuous and winding, that can lead straight to the celestial heights;
I have one field, winding and looping, that can circle back to the earthly depths.

Hidden in motion like the *Kūn Mǎ* (坤马, Earthly Steed),
Ascending in counterflow to the *Yín Hé* (银河, Silver River),
The rolling and swaying of the *Yǐngshuǐ* (游玑, Wandering Sphere) unfolds within a single body,
While mist and clouds emit and disperse through the seven orifices.
All spirits gather, and the hundred meridians flow freely,
The two *qì* (二气, *yīnyáng qì*) merge to restore the winds,
As the Three Palaces (三宫, *Sāngōng*—*Cāi*, *Rén*, and *Du**) ascend and descend without ceasing.
Thus, the enlightened lamp reflects back upon itself.

The boundless heavens are clear and empty—who can hear them?
This is what Dao is.»

The non-action is the function, the action is its application.
Then, the essence is stored within the vessel—
Motion and stillness are the daily mechanism.

First, the Jade Furnace is established,
Then the Golden Cauldron is set in place,
Above—*Xuán* (玄), below—*Zhā* (扎),
Left—*Yīn*, right—*Yáng*.
The Dragon and Tiger leap in union,
*Kǎn* and *Lí* alternate in action,
The Four Symbols are arranged,
The Five Phases are pierced and harmonized,
The Seven Luminaries are arrayed in order,
The Eight Gates open and close.
Thus, the Mother and Child guard each other,
And the matchmaker unites the couple—
Harmony between husband and wife is achieved.

Transforming earth, water, and fire,
Corresponding to day and time,
Rabbit’s lung and Crow’s liver—
Their medicines combine to the weight of one *jīn*.
Yellow buds and white snow—
Their essence is born from the two lands’ finest.

When the work is complete,
The thirty-six thousand spirits ascend to the Emperor’s court,
And thus I can transcend the world,
Seizing the nine hundred ninety million [of existence].

Moreover, the complete Dao lies in the alchemical transformation of the body—
Naturally, entering *yǒu* from *yǒu*,
Returning to *wú* from *wú*,
The interplay of *yǒu* and *wú*,
Form and spirit both refined,
Discarding the Three Corpses and surpassing the Three Realms,
Ascending to the Upper Purity and attaining the High Immortal,
Escaping the cycles of *yīn* and *yáng*,
Thus aligning with Heaven and Earth.

Wandering through the four directions,
Entering and exiting the eight extremes,
Moving when I will, going where my intent leads—
What care have I for life, death, or fortune and misfortune?

The *Hollow Valley* alchemical texts number a hundred,
Now I select fourteen to present.

**The First:**
This subtle principle is rare to grasp—
Cleaving the chaos to establish the alchemical foundation.
A mist of gold and water, torn like ice,
Three feet of frost and flames take flight.
*Kǎn* and *Lí* divide north and south,
Morning and evening—fire aligns with Heaven’s design.
A single pill transforms into pure *Yáng* essence,
Reining in the reins, whipping the steed into the Purple Micro.

**The Second:**
The tower soars above the market’s bustle,
Its gates welcoming twin paths to the misty heavens.
The Dark Furnace is swept by the Golden Boy,
The White Cauldron is poured by the Jade Girl.
Wind stirs the green pool, shaking the mushrooms,
Moonlight pierces the true hall, illuminating the banana leaves.
Within the pavilion, the carefree maiden sings—
A thousand years dissolve beneath these eyes.

**The Third:**
Drifting and floating without striking the boat,
The true spirit shifts, wandering the nine heavens.
Fire within water merges and harmonizes,
*Yīn* wraps *yáng*, yet freedom prevails.
The White-Faced Gentleman drives the Tiger’s tail,
The Red-Robed Boy grasps the Dragon’s head.
Once he enters the Jade Terrace, unbound,
He cares not for spring and autumn in the mortal world.

**The Fourth:**
Shaking off dust and purifying the heart,
Not letting worldly affairs intrude carelessly.
Sitting still, refining the true *qi*,
Silent, nurturing the sacred gold.
Two paths lead to the vast sea,
The Silver River surges, cascading from high peaks.
This is the family’s crucial secret—
The Twenty-Eight return, stepping deep in reverence.

**The Fifth:**
At the White Jade Tortoise Peak, the Mother’s home,
The red sun barely touches the three blooms.
A single drop of ghee falls like dew on the mulberry,
Nine petals of yellow drift like mist at the valley’s mouth.
The crane’s crown bears the refined elixir,
The lotus heart, uncluttered, radiates brilliance.
If one does not seek the twin paths,
Wandering endlessly along the sea’s edge is futile.

**The Sixth:**
One *qi* fills the void, pure and uncarved,
*Xuán* and *Huáng* split—*Liǎng Yī* opens.
*Kǎn* and *Lí* still govern *Qián* and *Kūn*,
The Rabbit and Crow are born from the womb of sun and moon.
Water, when exhausted, returns to the bound sea,
Stars, when absent, turn toward the North Star.
The Three Powers I hold in the center’s excellence—
Creation and transformation naturally align.

**The Seventh:**
The empty heart resonates with the ten thousand sounds,
The divine chamber condenses in the deepest night.
Waves cluster snowflakes on the cauldron’s face,
Light plays with starry hues in the furnace’s heart.
The Five Phases gather—*Gēng* returns to *Yǐ*,
The Three Dynasties unite—*Bǐng* reverts to *Rén*.
Creation’s work is worthy of admiration—
From the fire, mushrooms sprout golden treasure.

**The Eighth:**
Returning to the origin, restoring the root—homeward bound,
Gradually, withered branches sprout tender shoots.
To recognize the *Dāo Guī* seek *Wù Jǐ*,
To know water and fire is the *Hé Chē*.
Initially, the Golden Lotus seed is transmitted,
Later, the Jade Tree blooms.
Children, two by two, wrapped in crimson gates,
Nightly explorations end in drunkenness on flowing wine.

**The Ninth:**
Suddenly taking up the poetic brush, my talent soars,
Spring marrow warms the cup, brimming and full.
Who would cleave the chaos?
I alone polish the *Hóng Móng*.
The Golden Lotus is sown in the elixir pool,
The Jade Tree is transplanted to the emerald hills.
Truly, the family’s landscape is splendid—
*Kǎn*’s son and *Lí*’s daughter arrive together.

**The Tenth:**
Who would believe the alchemical work is shallow,
Seeking the One within the Three and Five?
If one knows how *Gēng Jiǎ* captures the Dragon and Tiger,
To recognize submersion and emergence—wood and metal.
*Kūn*’s six produces *Lí*’s inner fire,
*Qián*’s three births *Kǎn*’s *Rén*.
The alchemical scriptures clearly state—
Only the bewildered fail to grasp this truth.

**The Eleventh:**
Do not be deceived by superficiality,
Who would ask the already enlightened?
Three returns to the Dawn add three months,
Once the flower flies, a spring is lost.
*Yáng*’s *qi* like smoke is truly regrettable,
The wilderness, like water, should not be neglected.
Thousands of scrolls and bamboo records attest—
Observe those who have attained the Dao before.

**The Twelfth:**
All speak of great concealment in *Hún Yǐn Luó*,
Yet laugh at mountain dwellers nurturing *Tài Hé*.
When fame and gain are slight, worldly affairs are slight,
Many pursuits bring many disputes.
Green waters and blue mountains transcend the nature’s cave,
Willow eyebrows and elixir faces sink into the river.
Ask if wealth can rival a nation—
Impermanence cannot be bought.

**The Thirteenth:**
The sun and moon revolve—examine carefully,
The *Tiān Wāi* pointer aligns with the Wandering Sphere.
The great work requires three thousand days,
The marvelous application lacks not the twelve hours.
Four and eight—*yīn* dissipates, impurities vanish,
Nine and three—*yáng* grows, merging with *Xī Yí*.
Every word of the Mystic Pass is true—
All secrets leak through these verses.

**The Fourteenth:**
The *Tài Yǐ* Divine Furnace, threefold and stored,
Circulating above and below, following *Qián* and *Kūn*.
Heaven revolves, Earth submits—tortoise and serpent respond,
*Yīn* kills, *yáng* is born—at the *Mǎo* and *Yǒu* Gates.

The fire advances through *Lún-Méng*, ever warm and balmy,
The cauldron contains gold and water, ever steady and mild.
The Mystic Pearl refined, its golden radiance dazzles bright,
Offered to the Void Sovereign—most exalted of all.

The *Modifying True Essence* scriptures speak of:
Five Phases inverted in their roots,
Three Fields reversed—*Winter Zi*, *Summer Wu*—
Divine qi stored within.

Master Hua Yang, shouldered by *Shān Wú*, heard from Master Zheng Yang, *Zhōng Lí Yún Fáng*:
*"Yù Qīng, Shàng Qīng, Tài Qīng, Tài Wú, Tài Xū, Tài Kōng, Tài Zhì"*—
These are the manifestations of the Great Dao’s *wu* and *yǔ* generating,
Establishing the foundation and markers of Heaven and Earth.

Speaking of humanity:
The Three Pure Ones are the gathered *jīng*, *qì*, and *shén* of parents—
*Jīng* and *xuè* as the exterior, *jīng* and *qì* as the wrapping,
Like the clear and turbid of Heaven and Earth.

The Pure Yang Master said:
*"When the Dragon and Tiger unite to form the Inner Elixir,*
*Three hundred days pass before True Qi arises,*
*Refined into the Yang Spirit—*
*First in the Yellow Court, then the Inner Precinct,*
*Finally emerging through the Heavenly Gate.*
*These are the Three Pure Ones of humanity."*

The kidneys are water—
Within water, *yuán qì* is born, comparable to Earth;
The heart is fire—
Within fire, true soil forms, comparable to the gathering of stones.
The spleen expands with exhalation, drawing kidney-qi upward;
With inhalation, it descends, meeting heart-qi below.
Thus, between breath and breath, the movements of Heaven and Earth are mirrored—
Pure qi enters the central palace,
Nourished by food and drink, receiving all things;
The refined essence of the four limbs is drawn from the five viscera—
These are the Three Talents of humanity.

The Pure Yang Master said:
*"Parental union generates the body—humanity’s Three Talents;*
*Heart and kidney unite to form the Elixir—my Three Talents."*

Master Hua Yang said:
*"How profound these words are!*
The moon is the essence of *Tài Yīn*—
Without *yáng*, it cannot generate, thus it receives the sun’s soul to shine.
The sun is the essence of *Tài Yáng*—
Without *yīn*, it cannot form, thus it obtains the moon’s shadow to manifest.

Within the body, it is as when kidney-qi passes to liver-qi—
When liver-qi emerges, the residual *yīn* of the kidneys is exhausted,
Thus the soul is born in the liver.
When heart-fluid passes to lung-fluid,
Lung-fluid arises, and the residual *yáng* of the heart is exhausted,
Thus the spirit is born in the lungs.

Within kidney-qi, take the water of *Zhēn Yī*—
Within heart-fluid, take the *Zhēng Yáng* qi.
Let the water of *Zhēn Yī* be the embryo,
As the moon’s shadow receives the sun’s soul to illuminate—
Let the water of *Zhēn Yī*, with *Zhēng Yáng* qi as master,
As the sun’s soul receives the moon’s shadow to radiate.

A year has twenty-four *qì*, and a day also has twenty-four *shí*:
Thus, *Hài-Zǐ-Chǒu* are the positions of *Rén-Gǔi*—
Belonging to *Xiǎo Xuě, Dà Xuě, Dōng Zhì, Xiǎo Hán, Dà Hán*.
*Yín-Mǎo-Chén* are the positions of *Jiǎ-Yǐ*—
Belonging to *Lì Chūn, Yǔ Shuǐ, Jīng Dì, Chūn Fēn, Qīng Míng, Gǔ Yǔ*.
*Wèi-Wǔ-Wèi* are the positions of *Bǐng-Dīng*—
Belonging to *Lì Xià, Xiǎo Mǎn, Máng Zhǒng, Xià Zhì, Xiǎo Shǔ, Dà Shǔ*.
*Shēn-Yǒu-Xū* are the positions of *Gēng-Xīn*—
Belonging to *Lì Qiū, Chǔ Shǔ, Bái Lù, Qiū Fēn, Hán Lù, Shuāng Jiàng, Lì Dōng*.

Five days make a *hòu*, three *hòu* make a *qì*, two *qì* make a *shí*.
The twelve *shí* are *yáng* times;
The twelve *shí* are *yīn* times.
*Gèn, Xùn, Kūn, Qián*—the four *guà* times—
Together forming twenty-four *shí*, matching the twenty-four *qì* of Heaven and Earth.
A day’s twelve *shí*, each *shí* thirty degrees—
Totaling three hundred sixty, matching Heaven and Earth’s three hundred sixty degrees.

Heaven and Earth’s spring, summer, autumn, winter,
The moon’s waxing, waning, dark, and new,
Humanity’s *Zǐ-Wǔ-Mǎo-Yǒu*—
All align in fourfold harmony.

Knowing the times and applying the method,
The Elixir is complete, qi is abundant—
Long life is achieved, refining qi into spirit grants sainthood.

The Five Phases are mutually generative:
Thus lung-qi moves only with kidney-qi,
Heart-qi moves only with liver-qi,
Spleen-qi moves only with heart-qi,
Lung-qi moves only with spleen-qi.
Within the Three Fields, *jīng* generates *qì*—
Secreting *jīng* strengthens *qì* itself.
Qi generates spirit—
Nurturing *qì* clarifies the spirit.

Mutual generation of the Five Phases extends life,
Reversing the Three Fields transcends mortality.

What are the Nine Palaces of humanity?
The *Dān Yuán* Palace—*shèn* (kidneys);
The *Zhū Líng* Palace—*xiǎo cháng* (small intestine);
The *Lán Tái* Palace—*gān* (liver);
The *Tiān Lí* Palace—*dǎn* (gallbladder);
The *Huáng Tíng* Palace—*pí* (spleen);
The *Xuán Líng* Palace—*dà cháng* (large intestine);
The *Shàng Shū* Palace—*fèi* (lungs);
The *Yù Fáng* Palace—*páng guāng* (bladder);
The *Jiàng Xiāo* Palace—*xīn* (heart).

Speaking of the Nine Provinces:
*Jì Zhōu*—*shèn* (kidneys);
*Yī Duì Zhōu*—*páng guāng* (bladder);
*Qīng Zhōu*—*gān* (liver);
*Xú Zhōu*—*dǎn* (gallbladder);
*Yáng Zhōu*—*xīn* (heart);
*Jīng Zhōu*—*xiǎo cháng* (small intestine);
*Liáng Zhōu*—*fèi* (lungs);
*Yōng Zhōu*—*dà cháng* (large intestine);
*Yù Zhōu*—*pí* (spleen).

In terms of form:
The lungs are eight inches long, shaped like a *huā gài* (flowered canopy);
The heart is nine inches long, shaped like a *chuí lián* (pendant lotus);
The liver is seven inches long, shaped like a *xuán hú* (suspended gourd);
The kidneys are three inches long, shaped like *xuán shí* (suspended stone);
The spleen is seven inches and six *fēn* long, shaped like a *fù pén* (inverted basin).
Their kinds are inexhaustible.

From kidney-qi, take the water;
From the heart’s embrace, take the qi.
Qi ascends, water descends—
This is the *Wèi Jì* hexagram.

The kidney-qi ascends to the crown, and the true water descends;
The heart-qi enters the elixir field, and the true qi ascends—
This is the **Jì Jì** (Already Fulfilled) hexagram.

When the heart and kidneys unite to form the inner elixir,
The liver and lungs transmit and manifest the fire stage,
Conforming to the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent,
And the numbers of the sun and moon’s advance and retreat.

How do the **Dragon** and **Tiger** unite?
From *Chén* (3–5 AM) and *Sì* (5–7 AM) until *Wǔ* (11 AM–1 PM) and cease,
Their **essence** is divided into three swallowings;
Thus, in a secluded chamber, one sits quietly,
Alternating hands and clasping knees,
Forgetting thoughts and severing contemplation,
Slightly raising the waist,
Closing the eyes and quieting the mind,
Filling the mouth with saliva,
Slowly exhaling through the nose,
Drawing in deeply again,
Pressing the saliva down—
The true Dragon will not ascend,
Drawing breath upward—
The true Tiger will not descend.

At first, one feels the throat dry;
Next, one feels the heart surge;
Finally, one feels the emotions unblocked.

Once the Dragon and Tiger unite,
Then there is no substance without generating substance—
Its form resembles **millet**,
Returning to the Yellow Court—
This is the **Mysterious Pearl**.

If the fire stage of refining is not misjudged,
Then it becomes the **Golden Elixir**.

Fire is the **Threefold True Fire**.
Ascending and descending in cycles,
There is the Dao of the **Microcosmic Orbit**.
Fifteen *liǎng* (150 *fēn*) make **360 *zhū*** (the daily cycle’s measure),
There is the degree of the Microcosmic Orbit.

Heaven-qi changes in five-day stages,
Thus the practitioner also advances and retreats the fire stage every five days.

The **Three Qi** reside in the Yellow Court;
Their method employs *Xū* (7–9 PM) and *Hài* (9–11 PM) until *Zǐ* (11 PM–1 AM),
Sitting quietly in a secluded chamber,
Shielding away thoughts and contemplation,
Slightly reclining at the desk,
Gently compressing the abdomen,
Making the breath nasal and continuous,
Using it without strain,
Silently storing the elixir field’s fire—
Its transformation never wearying,
Compressing it without movement,
If exhausted, temporarily pausing before compressing again—
This is to gather the dispersed qi,
Imagining fire turning at the kidneys,
The heart-fire descending into the Yellow Court,
At first slightly painful in the abdomen,
Then gradually warming,
Practiced thus to nourish the deficient and benefit the qi,
Accumulated to prolong life.

If one combines this with the earlier **Dragon-Tiger** practice,
In **100 days**, descend fire by **five *liǎng*** (50 *fēn*), from *Xū* until *Zǐ*,
Refining essence into **mercury**—the medicinal potency is complete;
In **200 days**, descend fire by **ten *liǎng*** (100 *fēn*), from *Yǒu* (5–7 PM) until *Zǐ*,
Refining mercury into **sand**—the **fetal chamber** is now firm;
In **300 days**, descend fire by **fifteen *liǎng*** (150 *fēn*), from *Shēn* (3–5 PM) until *Zǐ*,
Refining sand into **gold**—pure **yang** qi is born.

How does one take fire?
With a **prayer bead** of **108**, concentrating breath to count—
Only when the count is complete does one obtain **one *zhū*** (unit of measure).

How does **flying gold** appear after the elbow?
At *Zǐ* (11 PM–1 AM), when **one yang** first stirs and one applies effort,
Sitting upright with clothes spread,
Clenching and storing the spirit,
Knocking teeth **24 times**,
Gathering spirit and harmonizing breath,
Forgetting thoughts and severing contemplation,
Closing the eyes and quieting the mind,
Storing the elixir field below,
Slightly arching the spine,
At first feeling slight warmth beneath the waist—
If not yet warm, arch again,
Until warmth arrives, then cease,
Thus the breath passes through the **Tailbone Pass** to the **Lower Pass**,
Then through the **Double Pass** at the **Jiaji** (paravertebral points),
Then through the **Upper Pass** at **Yùjīng** (left of the heart),
Ascending until it strikes—
One collision at the **three passes**, entering the **Muddy Pellet**,
And ceases when the sun rises.
Practiced thus in one night,
It can restore a year’s loss;
If the count is full,
It can nourish the brain and benefit the marrow,
Turning back aging and restoring youth.

Thus, *Chén* and *Sì* are called **uniting**,
*Xū* and *Hài* are called **advancing fire**,
*Zǐ* is called **retreating fire**.

How is it called the **Golden Elixir Returning Elixir**?
Its method employs *Zǐ* (11 PM–1 AM),
Sitting quietly and storing the ascending breath,
Covering the ears and closing the nostrils,
Lightly swaying and scattering,
Making kidney-qi ascend to the crown,
Assaulting the **spirit-water** to descend—
From above, it descends in a sudden rush,
Cold and sweet, not rinsed before swallowing.
With time, bones become strong,
The body light and resilient against cold and heat.

How is it called the **Jade Elixir Returning Elixir**?
Its method employs *Chén* and *Sì* (3–5 AM and 5–7 AM) for uniting,
Sitting quietly and severing all thoughts,
Using the tongue to press the tooth gaps,
Drawing in both cheeks,
Swallowing when saliva appears,
Or swallowing breath when there is none—
Filling the count of **360**,
This is the qi ascending from the lungs,
Which can restore a year’s loss alone;
If one has the **inner elixir**, this is not needed.

At *Zǐ* (11 PM–1 AM), storing the ascending breath and arching the spine,
One collision at the **three passes**—
Once entered at the crown, quickly closing the breath,
Covering the ears and swaying,
The **golden elixir** is made to descend—
Thus, not rinsed before swallowing,
At that moment, raising the body and lifting the abdomen,
The elixir field’s pure yang ascends and descends,
Meeting beneath the **Double Layered Pavilion**—
This is **Already Fulfilled**.

At first, a single **pearl** forms,
As large as **millet**, its hue bright and yellow,
Returning then to the Yellow Court—
This is the **Golden Millet**.

Thus, **golden light** emerges from the skin and hair,
Counting the effort and fixing the breath’s measure—
This is the **Already Fulfilled** stage.

A person’s **original qi** completes **one cycle daily**,
Their **original spirit** alternates every **ten days**.

On *Jiǎ-Yǐ* (Wood-Earth days), at *Mǎo* (5–7 AM), refine **liver-qi**;
On *Bǐng-Dīng* (Fire days), at *Wǔ* (11 AM–1 PM), refine **heart-qi**;
On *Gēng-Xīn* (Metal days), at *Yǒu* (5–7 PM), refine **lung-qi**;
On *Rén-Gùi* (Water days), at *Zǐ* (11 PM–1 AM), refine **kidney-qi**—
All refined into **spirit**.

Only the **Spleen** lacks inherent *qi* and thus requires no refining.
On *Wù-Jǐ* (Earth days), rest quietly in stillness—
Sit upright in a secluded chamber,
Banish all thoughts and worries,
Tap the teeth twenty-four times,
Let the mind dwell solely in the **Dao**,
Calm the spirit, harmonize the *qi*—
Silently observe the organ being refined;
When the mind arrives, the *qi* will follow of its own accord.

The **pure-yang fire** of the **Elixir Field** now gathers—
This is the **Convergence of the Three Flowers**,
Not to be compared with the fire of *samādhi*.

After ten days of refining,
Each organ refined ten times over a hundred days—
Then the *qi* ascends, the spirit manifests,
Each rising in its own hue, a kaleidoscope of colors,
Circulating and reflecting back—
One sees the five-colored clouds arise from the **Crucible**,
This is the **transformation of *qi* into spirit**,
Ascending to **Heavenly Primordium** and entering the **Divine Officials**.

Yet fear the outer demons that would disrupt the **True Nature**—
Swiftly withdraw inward observation to ignite the fire.

Thus it is said:
To seek **longevity**, refine the **Elixir** and subdue the fire;
To seek **immortality**, return the **Elixir** and refine the form;
To seek **ascension**, transform *qi* into spirit.

**Yānluózi** said:
The **Immortal** swallows *qi*,
Seals the breath so it does not enter,
Letting it circulate in the throat—
When the *qi* is full and hard to contain,
Sit upright and elevate the waist,
Thus without ceasing,
The *qi* surges, dispelling stagnation,
And breath may be prolonged for a time.
Accumulated *qi* generates essence,
Nourishing internally the five **zàng** and six **fǔ**,
Moistening externally the skin and flesh.

This is the **supreme method of ease**,
Yet it does not exhaust the **Mysterious Subtlety**.

The **Mysterious Subtlety** lies in
Sitting in seclusion, stillness, and thoughtlessness,
Swallowing *qi* and sealing the breath,
When urgent, elevate the body;
When relaxed, exchange breaths and seize the residual *qi*—
Thus the heart and abdomen grow empty,
The head and eyes sharpen,
The body feels full and joyous,
The spirit and *qi* harmonize—
This is the method of **prolonging life**.

If one overeats,
Seal the breath and empty the mind—
The excess will naturally dissipate.
If *qi* and blood stagnate,
Seal the breath and silently observe the ailment’s location—
The illness will then be cured.

To **inhale nine breaths, swallow one**,
To **retain three, exhale seven**,
To **fix the breath and observe inwardly**—
All things will be accomplished.
This is the **secret of longevity**.

What is meant by this?
Inhale pure *qi* through the nose nine times,
Then swallow once in the throat,
Preventing the inhaled *qi* from circulating.
When it feels urgent, elevate the body to gather *qi* and exhale,
Do not let it fully escape—
Always retain two or three breaths.
At the moment of sealing the breath,
Silently observe the five **zàng**—
The *qi* will naturally flow and harmonize,
And the ailments will depart.

**Zhèngyáng Zhēnrén** said:
To awaken **Yang Gong’s eldest son**,
One must **absorb much and exhale little**,
Following the **struggle of yin and yang**,
Seizing the **True One** beyond its time.

**Chúnyáng Zhēnrén** explained:
**Yang Gong** is **Heaven (乾)**.
**Heaven** seeks **Earth (坤)** and generates **Thunder (震)**,
**Thunder** is the eldest son,
In the body, it is the **Liver**,
In time, it is the **Mao hour (5–7 AM)**—
This is the **Tài (泰) hexagram**,
The season of **three yangs**.

At this time, the **Kidney’s *qi*** is like an infant,
Ascending to nourish the **Liver**,
The **Heart’s essence** is like an old woman,
Descending to the **Lungs**,
The **Lung’s *qi*** interacts—
Thus, inhalation is abundant,
Exhalation is sparse,
The *qi* is condensed and not allowed to descend—
This is the **struggle of yin and yang**.

Accumulated *qi* generates essence,
Thus the **True *qi*** grows ever more abundant—
Hence, **seizing the True One beyond its time**.

Thus, the **Mysterious Subtlety** does not depart from the **Mao hour**.

Externally, it corresponds to **Tài (泰)**,
Internally, it aligns with the **interaction of Kǎn (坎) and Lí (离)**—
Inhaling pure *qi*,
Elevating the body inwardly,
Silently counting the **Microcosmic Orbit** three hundred and sixty times,
One may **seize a year’s *qi*** to compensate for past losses—
This surpasses **Womb-Breathing** in its efficacy.
The weak may strengthen their bones,
The aged may return to youth.

**Qíbó** said:
A person’s **True *qi***
Is stored in the **Liver** in spring,
In the **Heart** in summer,
In the **Lungs** in autumn,
In the **Kidneys** in winter.
The **Liver** and **Heart** are **yang**,
The **Lungs** and **Kidneys** are **yin**—
Nurture them according to the seasons,
Without exceeding the **solstices and equinoxes**.

The method of nurturing is:
To remain **unperturbed and self-adjusting**,
Sitting in stillness and observing inwardly the organ being nourished—
The *qi* will naturally condense, taking **form and appearance**.

Thus, **yin *qi*** is the **embryo**,
**Yang *qi*** is the **breath**—
When the *qi* is still, the form is still—
This is the **key to longevity**.

The *Língshū* says:
**Heaven and Earth inverted**,
**Yin and yang generated in reverse**,
Refining **lead** and **mercury**,
The **Dao** arises naturally.

**Biānqiú** said:
Fifteen days after **Winter Solstice**,
**True Lead** accumulates one part,
Its form like **light smoke**—
If refined, one may attain **ease and longevity**.
Thirty days,
**True Lead** accumulates two parts,
Its form like **thin mist**—
If refined, one may **reverse aging and return to youth**.
Forty-five days,
**True Lead** accumulates three parts,
Its form like **hanging dew**—
If refined, one may **preserve the form and dwell in the world**.

Fifteen days after **Summer Solstice**,
**True Mercury** accumulates one part,
Its form like **playful petals**—
If refined, one may **strengthen bones and lighten the body**.
Thirty days,
**True Mercury** accumulates two parts,
Its form like **held lotus**—
If refined, one may **achieve longevity and clear vision**.
Forty-five days,
**True Mercury** accumulates three parts,
Its form like **embracing an egg**—
If refined, one may **refine the form and transform *qi***.

Thus, refining **True Lead** yields the **Yang Embryo**,
Refining **True Mercury** yields the **Yin Breath**.
Using **Yin Breath** for the **Yang Embryo**,
The **formless transforms into the formed**.
Using the **Yang Embryo** to enter the **Yin Breath**,
The **formless generates the substantial**.

Yet **Qíbó** did not know the timing,
And **Biānqiú** did not transmit the method.

If one follows only the **solstices and equinoxes**,
The timing is not yet refined.
If one observes inwardly according to the seasons,
The method is not yet complete.

Only at **Winter’s Zǐ hour** and **Summer’s Wǔ hour**
Should one **condense the breath and retain the *qi***,
Then sit in stillness,
Gather the body and focus the spirit,
Directing attention first—
Only then may it be said to be **complete and perfect**.

「Thus, the essence of **Fetal Breathing** lies in severing all movement of thought—
like pouring water on stone, where nothing can penetrate.
Only then does the spirit settle and the *qi* harmonize,
the **Original Soul** abide, and the **True Embryo** condense.

This is the **Unleaked** state:
three years for minor attainment,
six years for medium attainment,
and nine years for great attainment.

**Divine Master** spoke of **Fetal Breathing** thus:
*"Diligently guard the center,
Do not let it stray.
Externals do not intrude,
Internals do not escape.
Return to the **Original Source**,
All matters conclude.
Cultivate with care,
Without regard for time.
*

**Master Cao** elucidated it:
*"Diligently guard the center"* means to internally retain the **spiritual awareness**;
*"Do not let it stray"* means to keep the **single intention** undivided;
*"Externals do not intrude"* means to regard all objects as nonexistent;
*"Internals do not escape"* means to dwell in dust yet remain unstained;
*"Return to the Original Source"* means to concentrate *qi* and achieve **suppleness**;
*"All matters conclude"* means to cease external desires;
*"Cultivate with care"* means to diligently practice;
*"Without regard for time"* means to attain **longevity and prolonged vision**.

Therefore, the practice of **True Fetal Breathing** consists solely in the **dual dissolution of body and self**,
the **convergence of spirit and *qi***,
condensing to form the **embryo**,
abiding to become the **breath**.
When **form and spirit** are both refined, one may achieve **longevity**;
when **spirit and *qi*** merge as one, one may attain **sainthood**.

Thus, exhausting **principle**, perfecting **nature**, and reaching **fate**,
the spirit and *qi* naturally harmonize,
from **nothingness** generating **somethingness**,
clarity within and without,
taking **color as emptiness**,
the **Heavenly True Original Soul**,
serene and self-delighted.

**Jade Emperor**’s divine method for **Fetal Breathing** states:
*"Preserve the Three, Guard the One."*

**Highest Primordial Lord** explained it:
*"The Three"* are **essence**, *qi*, and **spirit**;
*"The One"* is the **kidney**.
From the kidney arises *qi*,
from the heart arises **spirit**;
when *qi* and **spirit** merge, they form **essence**,
and when **essence** and **spirit** abide, they descend below.
Thus, **store the spirit above**,
**retain the *qi* in the middle**,
**preserve the essence below**—
when the three are stored,
then **guard the One** in the **elixir field**,
ignoring all distinctions of internal/external objects
and methods of *qi* ascent/descent.
The *qi* naturally returns to its **Original Source**,
condensing to form the **embryo**,
while the **spirit** follows the *qi* undispersed,
becoming the **breath**.

When **spirit and *qi*** are unified as one,
there is no **death or life**;
when **heart and kidney** share the same *qi*,
there is no **illness or disease**.
How then do all **phenomena** enter?
How do all **thoughts** arise?

If one wearies of the **mundane world**,
then one should **elevate the *qi*** to form the **spirit embryo**,
and **converge the spirit*** to become the **master of *qi***.

Thus, the **spirit embryo** and **breath of *qi***,
divided into **three aspects**—the **manifest** and the **formless**—
transform into **ten thousand forms**,
with the **true soul** undissipated—
this is the **method of attaining #8 Sainthood**.

**Supreme Lord’s Mysterious Principle** states the natural method of **Fetal Breathing** as:
*"Longevity and prolonged vision."*

**Master Xu** elucidated it:
*"Sit in stillness, forget all thinking,
and gaze long at the **Upper Field**—
then the **spirit** attains longevity;
gaze long at the **Middle Field**—
then the **breath** attains longevity;
gaze long at the **Lower Field**—
then the **form** attains longevity.
‘Gaze’ means to fix one’s vision
without departing from its object—
the **heart-spirit** follows the gaze and ceases,
the **kidney-*qi*** responds to the spirit and transmits.
Thus, the **formed *qi*** hides within the **formless spirit**,
the **embryo** within the **form**,
the **breath** within the **embryo**;
the **breath** abides with the **spirit**,
the **spirit** exists with the **breath**—
this is the **way of prolonged vision**.

I know only the **body** between **heaven and earth**,
and within the **body**, only **spirit and *qi*** exist.

Thus, gazing upward at the **spirit palace**,
the **spirit** does not disperse—
gazing long refines the **spirit**,
the **spirit** gathers as the **embryo**,
and the transmitted *qi* enters to become the **breath**—
naturally **above**;
gazing downward at the **breath conduit**,
the **breath** does not disperse—
gazing long refines the **breath**,
the *qi* gathers as the **embryo**,
and the preserved **spirit** enters to become the **breath**—
naturally **middle**.

Refining the **breath** and merging it,
constantly guarding the **elixir field**,
condensing to form the **embryo**,
abiding to become the **breath**—
naturally **below**.

**Upper, middle, lower** refer to the **Three Fields**.

The **True Water** of the kidney is the **Tiger**;
the **Rectified Breath** of the heart is the **Dragon**.
When **Dragon and Tiger** merge, they form the **Mysterious Pearl**,
and when the **fire alchemy** is complete, it becomes **Golden Elixir**.

Take the **end of the Zǐ hour** and the **beginning of the Wǔ hour**—
this is the time of **Xùn** (the southeast wind).
In a secluded chamber, sit upright,
fill the mouth with saliva,
neither spit nor swallow,
and press it to contain the **Dragon and Tiger’s *qi***,
preventing them from fleeing.
Merge them to form the **Mysterious Pearl**,
its size like a **millet grain**,
returning it to the **Yellow Court**.
Each cycle, it can augment **True Breath** by a **ten-foot measure**.

What is **fire alchemy**?
The **Rectified Yang *qi*** of the heart is the **True Fire**;
when **True Fire** ascends, it refines the **form**,
and when it descends, it returns to the **Original Source**,
augmenting *qi* and prolonging life.

At the **end of the Xū hour** and the **beginning of the Hài hour**—
this is the time of **Gàn** (the northwest wind).
In a secluded chamber, sit upright,
do not move the **sides or abdomen**,
condense and retain the transmitted **kidney-*qi**,
preventing it from ascending.
Internally visualize the **True Fire** descending,
and practice this for one day to replenish a year’s **deficiency**.

**Pure Yang Master** said:
*"The essence of **Golden Elixir** lies in
**preserving ascent, opening closure**,
**passing through gates without haste**,
**fire alchemy without deviation**—
this is the **method of producing Golden Elixir**.

After the **Zǐ hour**, when **one Yang** first stirs,
don the **clothes of the cosmos**, sit upright,
grasp and stabilize internally,
preserve the **lower waist and body**,
so the **kidney** merges and the *qi* gathers.
When one feels the **umbilical abdomen** slightly warm,
gradually ascend the *qi* through the **body**,
slightly arch the **spine**,
and circulate the **kidney-*qi*** back to the **tailbone**,
from below to above,
passing through the **Middle Gate**,
directly entering the **Jade Axis** at the **pituitary gland**,
to replenish the **brain**—
naturally the **marrow is filled** and the **bones are fortified**.

If refining **Golden Elixir**,
then perform the **retrograde fire** method.

When **Dragon and Tiger** merge to form the **Mysterious Pearl**,
descending **heart-fire** is the method of **replenishment**,
and **flying gold crystals** from behind the elbow
is the method of **brain supplementation**—
both are used as **Golden Elixir**.

The **Mysterious Pearl** is the **substance of Golden Elixir**.

**Advancing and retrograde fire alchemy** align with the **circuit of the heavens**—
practicing **300 days without deviation** produces **Golden Elixir**.

Condensing the **breath** and retaining it,
practice the **108 cycles**,
from **Zǐ hour** in reverse to **Wǔ hour**,
descending **heart-fire** to refine the **Yellow Court**—
thus, **five days increase by six grains**,
and **twenty-five days shift by one hour**—
this is the **advancing fire** method."*

---

「Lift the body and recline the spine,
practice the **108 cycles**,
from **Zǐ hour** in forward progression to **Wǔ hour**,
using **kidney-back flying** to replenish the **Mysterious Pearl**—
thus, **five days increase by six grains**,
and **twenty-five days shift by one hour**—
this is the **retrograde fire** method.

Once the **Internal Elixir** condenses and generates **pure yang qi**,
this is called **qi within qi**.

Thus, without regard for day or night,
lift the body and sit upright—
this is the **Great Sun** method.
Refine it for **100 days**, and the body becomes light;
refine it for **1,000 days**, and it ascends, entering the **Southern Palace** as an **immortal**.

With **pure yang** following the **original qi** as it circulates,
refine the **qi of the five zàng organs**,
condensing it into the **embryonic essence**—
refining **qi** can thus forge the **spirit**.

On **丙 (Bǐng) and 丁 (Dīng) days**,
the time is **Wǔ hour**;
On **庚 (Gēng) and 辛 (Xīn) days**,
the time is **Yǒu hour**;
On **壬 (Rén) and 癸 (Guǐ) days**,
the time is **Zǐ hour**;
On **甲 (Jiǎ) and 乙 (Yǐ) days**,
the time is **Mǎo hour**.

Thus, sit in stillness and forget all thought,
draw in the **double cheeks**,
and use the **empty swallow** technique at the throat—
the number of swallows should not exceed **100**,
**ten days** for a full cycle of **washing and nourishing**,
and **100 days** to complete the process.
Thus, **pure yang qi** no longer harms the **five zàng organs**,
the **original spirits** of the five zàng organs conceal within the **true qi** and do not scatter,
and the **true qi** of the five zàng organs conceal within the **original qi** and do not deplete.
Through this, follow the **original qi** as it circulates to refine its **qi**,
thus **qi refines spirit**,
and the **spirit emerges from qi**,
resting at the **original apex**,
entering the **Mysterious Pearl**.
Those without **Elixir** may practice this method,
washing and nourishing at the proper times to refine the **form**.

**Chapter 20 of the *Dao Gun* Scroll**
**True Unity Inner Elixir Section**

Close the breath and rinse the essence—
let *yin* and *yang* flow through.
The method’s timing spans a year’s work.

*Child* (子) is **Restoration**;
*Cow* (丑) is **Approach**;
*Tiger* (寅) is **Harmony**;
*Rabbit* (卯) is **Great Strength**;
*Dragon* (辰) is **Confinement**;
*Snake* (巳) is **Heaven**;
*Horse* (午) is **Nurturing**;
*Sheep* (未) is **Pursuit**;
*Monkey* (申) is **Decay**;
*Rooster* (酉) is **Contemplation**;
*Dog* (戌) is **Diminution**;
*Pig* (亥) is **Earth**.

A year holds twelve months,
a day holds twelve hours—
I align hours with years.

Each hour engages two *guà*,
twelve *yáo* in total—
the pattern of a year.

Thus, one hour’s practice yields a year’s effect.
Yet from *Child* to *Snake* it may be done,
but after *Horse*, it cannot be used.

At *Child*’s hour, first ignite the fire.
Breath is fire; fire is the *yang yáo*.
Close the breath thirty-six times—
one *yang yáo*—then introduce the water.
Saliva is water; water is the *yin yáo*.
Rinse the essence twenty-four times—
one *yin yáo*.

Thus, at *Child*’s hour, practice **Restoration**,
and after *Snake*, practice **Nurturing**,
always moving in opposition.

Here, one hour employs two *guà*.
At *Child*’s hour, one *yang* and five *yin*—
first close the breath thirty-six times,
then rinse the essence twenty-four times.
Afterward, perform the *Horse*’s *guà*—
one *yin* and five *yang*—
rinse the essence twenty-four times,
then close the breath thirty-six times—
five repetitions,
harmonizing with *Child* to form six *yin* and six *yang*,
thus seizing a year’s effect.

In practice, adhere to the *yáo*’s *yin-yang* count,
sitting level, gripping firmly, pressing the teeth.
At *Child*’s hour, face the *Child* position—
the rest follow suit.
After completion, employ *Tian Dao* guidance
repeatedly.

With time, the Inner Elixir forms.
After a year, bathe it in the **Great Yang**—
the **Pearl of the Jade Pool** entering the **Golden Chamber**,
round as a bullet, yellow as a tangerine.

Cultivating *qi* refines *yang* to temper *yin*.
*Yang* begins at *Child*, peaks at *Snake*;
*Yin* begins at *Horse*, peaks at *Pig*.
Thus, always practice *Child*’s hour with *Tiger*’s,
ceasing at *Horse*—avoiding *yin qi*.

**Still-Dan Supplement**
One breath of essence—
fire alone makes it flourish.
The root of **Still-Dan** lies in **Southern *Li*** (離).

Of old, **Zhū Rén** drilled wood to kindle fire,
**Nü Wa** refined stone to mend the heavens—
thus merging the **Divine Elixir’s** way.

Someone asks: What does this mean?
It is said: Wood is the nature of **mercury**;
metal is the true fire.
Thus, **Still-Dan’s** root is in **Southern *Li***.

Why?
It is born within the **Great Yang**,
transforming form only when fire is obtained.

The first transformation—it hides its form within the chaos of *Hun Dun*,
sensing the womb of the Mother, receiving the essence of *qi*—this is when the red becomes mercury.

The second transformation—when the red essence unites with the *Dan Tian*,
becoming the foundation for receiving *qi*, melting and congealing into solidified fat.
Then, the soul and spirit descend to the *He-Bao* position—this is when mercury becomes snow.

The third transformation—when the green divine liquid alone transforms at *Fu-Sang*,
this is when snow becomes sand.

The fourth transformation—when the White Tiger’s principle harmonizes its *qi* and mercury,
returning to its original nature, this is when sand becomes yellow.

The fifth transformation—when the dark-yellow transformation is profound,
arising from the *Hou Tu* breath, filling the *Upper Primordial*,
splitting form and substance—this is when yellow becomes lead-gold.

Thus it is said: One substance contains five colors—is this not what is meant?

Mercury without fire becomes empty in body,
lead with water becomes luminous in form.
Is this not the visible hare of the moon?
Is this not the invisible crow of the sun?

Thus, the Supreme Elixir is the Dao of emptiness and nothingness.
Mercury and lead—what do they transmit?
They emerge from vague confusion and transform in the depths of obscurity.
Born at the very beginning of the Great Primordial,
formed within the chaos of *Hun Dun*,
they are the essence of *Qian* and the foundation of *Kun*.

Thus, the circulation of *qi* spans three thousand six hundred years,
and the seasons of refinement are nine revolutions and eight jade elixirs.
From this, water and fire fill the *Dan Tian*,
while the sun and moon begin and end within the crucible.
Following the written and the martial,
spirit-refining the profound and mysterious,
seizing the workings of creation in the furnace,
entrusting *Qian* and *Kun* to the palm—
*qi* surges through the body, moving naturally back and forth.
A dragon is born at the Green Mercury Gate,
a tiger is subdued on the White Metal Path.
Essence sinks into the *Qi Sea*,
*qi* embraces the primordial essence.
Dark-yellow transformation occurs,
*qi* and substance mutually depend.
Returning to the red of the Southern realm—
thus is named the Way of *Huan Dan*.

The Five Phases are inverted,
the Eight Trigrams are reversed in order.
Soul and spirit descend to the *He-Bao* position—
their transformations are boundless.

Purple Palace, Immortal Metropolis,
Jade Cavern, Elixir Chamber,
Black Chariot, Golden Toad,
Hare Riding the White Steed—
thus divine efficacy is achieved.

When the moon is full, it wanes;
when the sun is at its zenith, it turns.
The radiant dark symbols interact,
soul and spirit exchange—
metal and water subdue externally without remainder.

*Lún* and *Méng*—these are the medicines;
*Pǐ* and *Tài*—these are the furnaces.
The rest each have their paired counterparts.

A year has three hundred sixty days,
corresponding to sixty-four hexagrams,
each with three hundred sixty lines.
A decade has one hundred twenty hours,
day and night moving through twelve lines and two hexagrams—
thus three decades make a year,
and nine decades make three years.

Sun and moon, like a turning wheel,
day and night in constant motion.
The sun has thirty degrees—
heaven and earth shift their gates.

The *Classic* says:
Thirty spokes converge at a single hub,
yet it is the empty space that holds the wheel’s use—
this aligns with the marvels of the law and symbol.

This is close to the Dao of the Elixir.

The *Ode* says:
*Guan guan* the mandarin duck calls,
on the isle of the river.
The female does not dwell alone,
the male does not roam solitary.
Thus, all things return to their roots,
gathering by kindred affinity.

Remove the mercury, and they separate—
as the *Plain Book* says: *"Like *qi* attracts like *qi*."*

The *Yin Symbol* says:
A yellow-bellied beast devours the tiger,
water and wood mutually assault,
the mulberry’s sweetness softens metal,
the River Chariot subdues mercury—
its secret lies in the divine water, the flowered pool.

The *Tai Yi Zhi* says:
Black is the foundation of water;
white is the body of metal.

The *Stone Cavern Record* says:
True Five Phases are one water, one stone.
The Central Palace is the master of *qi*.
Water and fire, when stirred, form substances—
this is the Golden Liquid, the Golden Elixir.

The *Parametric Concordance* says:
Sow millet with millet,
attach the parrot with seeds.
Is this what is meant?

Yin True Lord says:
Yin is true sand;
Yang is true mercury—
seek them without reckless action.

Without substance yet generating substance—
this is *Huan Dan*,
not the common mercury or sand.

Qing Xia Zi says:
I possess elixir sand,
taking the essence of gold, the life of stone,
uniting as husband and wife,
arranging as soul and spirit,
one body in chaos,
two emotions in mutual stimulation—
this is elixir sand.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*Initial Nine*: The hidden dragon, not yet used.
*Nine Two*: The dragon appears in the field.
*Nine Three*: The superior man perseveres unremittingly all day.

What does this mean?
All things are born from One,
age at Nine—
mercury, before obtaining fire to transform,
is hidden within the sand—
this is the hidden dragon, not yet used.

When sand’s true form is flown by fire,
entering lead, it meets true fire and true mercury in mutual stimulation—
this is the dragon appearing in the field.
The field is the *Dan Tian*.
Elixir is mercury,
the field is earth—
earth nurtures all things.

Water contains earth—
this is true gold.
True gold is the *Dan Tian*—
this is persevering unremittingly all day.
When gold and mercury become true,
transformation is possible.

*Qian* is fire, is gold.
Nine is the number of lead;
three is the number of wood.
Heaven, obtaining One, reveals water;
obtaining Two, reveals fire;
obtaining Three, reveals wood;
obtaining Four, reveals metal;
obtaining Five, reveals earth—
the cultivator must not fail to know this.

White gold is mercury—
each should weigh eight *liang*,
two eights making one *jin*—
this is the number for refining sand,
refining the spirit’s form,
all gathered into One.

One is water.

Fire is within water,
wood is within fire,
metal is within wood,
earth is within metal.

When the Five Phases merge into One, the dual principles of *Yin* and *Yang* open and close,
and the sun and moon shine bright—
the Three Realms are complete.

Thus, One gives rise to Two,
Two gives rise to Three,
Three gives rise to all things.

*Qian* is Father, *Kun* is Mother,
within them are cold and heat,
*Yin* and *Yang*,
sun and moon,
stars and constellations—
their orderly progression and retreat,
their ascendance and decline,
all follow the Dao of Nature.

Sand and mercury—
with fire, they ascend and soar;
with water, they conceal their form;
with metal, they interact harmoniously;
with wood, their essence becomes manifest;
with earth, they take form and grow.

Thus, metal becomes the elixir,
the elixir becomes the White Tiger,
the White Tiger is true fire,
true fire is the sun’s spirit,
the sun’s spirit is the golden goose,
the golden goose is the Flower Pool,
the Flower Pool is yellow lead,
yellow lead is the Alchemist.

Mercury, with wood, becomes the Green Dragon,
the Green Dragon is yellow water,
yellow water is the moon’s essence,
the moon’s essence is the jade hare,
the jade hare is the yellow sprout.

The yellow sprout—
it arises from the *Dan Tian*.
The fundamental essence of the *Dan Tian*
is called the Golden Sovereign.

If I know this Dao,
I need not discard gold and water
to transform into the Green Dragon.

The Green Dragon—
it is mercury,
and must await the completion of *Xuan Huang*’s beginning and end.

Within *Xuan Huang* lies the True.

Metal must commune with the spirit of wood,
with the spirits of ghosts and gods.
Ghosts and gods—
they are formless.

The Great Emperor deems the Golden Chamber as carefree,
descending from the *Tai He* passage,
thus one may attain immortality.

To seek the Flower Pool,
one must pass through this gate—
within it lies the hidden cinnabar.

I understand the crucibles,
perceive their forms,
master the Five Phases,
exhaust the Eight Trigrams,
determine the beginning and end of ascendance and decline,
distinguish the origins of imprisonment and death,
where souls and spirits contend,
where *Yin* and *Yang* interact—
metal hides within the trigrams of autumn and winter,
mercury conceals itself in the forms of spring and summer.

The south is the divine essence of elixir and mercury;
the northwest is the way of blending water and metal.

I possess diagrams of the Ten Heavenly Stems:
The center is the root of all things,
*Wu* and *Ji* are the alchemists who refine;
the east is *Jia* and *Yi*—
*Jia* is the sinking stone,
*Yi* is the floating stone;
the south is *Bing* and *Ding*—
*Bing* is martial fire,
*Ding* is civil fire;
the west is *Geng* and *Xin*—
*Geng* is worldly gold,
*Xin* is worldly silver;
the north is *Ren* and *Gui*—
*Ren* is true lead,
*Gui* is true mercury.

Ah!
I have uncovered the secrets of Heaven!

**The Golden Mirror Chapter on Water and Fire**

The numbers of water and fire, the symbols of *Kàn* and *Lí*—
Trace their profundity, and half the Dao is attained.

*Xuānyī* says: *"Observe the boundless *Tiān* and *Kūn*—
The Way moves effortlessly within them.
Thus, *Lí* is the precision of the sun,
*Kàn* is the brilliance of the moon.*

The cauldron follows the patterns of Heaven and Earth,
The alchemical method follows the cycles of sun and moon,
And there are the symbols of male and female.
It begins with *Pǐ* and *Tài*,
Completes with *Jìjié* and *Wèijié*—
Thus the alchemical cauldron is formed,
Not the vulgar five metals and eight stones of the world.

The *Classic* says:
*"One generates Two, Two generates Three,
Three generates the myriad things.
Thus, the One is water,
The One is fire,
The Three is wood as the dragon,
Found in the east,
The Four is metal as the tiger,
The Five is earth, harmonizing with the five phases,
Manifesting the four symbols.
Within *Tiān* and *Kūn*,
Below, there are forms;
Above, there are symbols.
My method follows the transformations of *Yin* and *Yang*—
As easy as turning one’s hand.

Thus, knowing the One of water,
The Two of fire,
The dual uses of *Kàn* and *Lí*,
And the essence of sun and moon—
Already, half the path to *Huándān* is attained.

Therefore, the Dao of the Five Phases,
Once grasped in its unity, is complete!"

*Xuānyī* says: *"How many deluded alchemists I have seen in this world!
They know only to covet gold and silver,
But do not aspire to longevity.
Do they truly understand
The roots of *Yin* and *Yang*,
The vital passes of south and north?
The secret says:
Use lead, yet do not use lead—
Seek it within lead itself.
When the time comes to use lead,
Whether to use it or not is a mistake.
To recognize *Huándān*,
One must never stray from lead’s foundation—
This is the essence of the Dao,
Yet the world does not know to refine lead.
They must know of *Jīngōng* and *Héchē*—
The Five Phases are all *Jīngōng*,
The true *qi* of the north is *Héchē*.

They take lead from Yà’ān,
Lead from Jiàn,
Lead from Tǔ,
Lead from Lóngtuó,
Lead from Cǎojié,
And forge them into a cauldron,
Then cast in mercury and nurture it with fire—
This is not the Dao I speak of.

The saying goes:
*If lead is true, it is a loyal servant;
If lead is false, it is untrustworthy.*
The key lies in the harmonious union of *Yin* and *Yang*,
The completeness of the Five Phases and the Four Symbols—
Only then does one know
That true lead is the true One,
The *Tàiyī* *Dāntián* beginning with lead.
Observe the wood within fire,
The metal within water—
Then lead and mercury are revealed.

The secret says:
*The Five Phases inverted, the dragon emerges from fire.
The Five Phases disordered, the tiger is born from water.*
This speaks of true water and fire,
The essence of sun and moon.

The cauldron has no head, no substance—
Yet without substance, substance is born.
Thus, when *Yin* reaches its peak, *Yang* arises,
And when *Yang* reaches its peak, *Yin* arises.

The foolish take empty furnaces,
Pile on thousands of pounds of charcoal,
Fan the flames in the open air,
Claiming to extract the essence of sun and moon—
Without substance, substance naturally forms.
Fire’s sweat gathers as crimson-red in the furnace,
Used as elixir, taken—it brings dryness.
Or they hold a water-jewel beneath the sun
To capture fire,
Or beneath the moon to reflect water,
Then refine the water with fire,
Claiming it as true water and fire,
The essence of sun and moon, for medicine.
Or they hear the words of the perfected ones:
*Harvest before the silkworm feeds,
Complete after the fire’s transformation*—
So they take mulberry leaves untouched by the silkworm,
Burn them to ash,
And on the eighth month’s full moon,
Collect the dew with the ash.

*Xuānyī* says: *"All of this is not the Dao.*

The sun rises above *Fúshāng* in *Jiǎ-Yǐ*—
The untraded one—
Fire is born from wood.
*Gēngshēn* is the moon’s cave—
This is the hour before *Yín*, after *Wèi*.
I have heard the secret:
*The King of Huánán is called Autumn Stone,
King Yáng concealed the Yellow Sprout,
The West receives the King’s *qi*,
The Dao is found in the Central Realm.*

Its form—
White on the outside,
Yellow within,
Like a *yīngzǐ* bird.
The world does not know of the West’s *Gēng-Xīn*—
The metal of *Duì*,
The White Star’s correspondence belongs to autumn,
The maiden of *Qián* adopts this *qi* for the cauldron’s palace
And crafts the elixir.

The maiden’s *qi*—
*Xuān* and *Hòu* call it *Jīnhuá*,
Huánán’s secret is *Qiūshí*.
Metal is the child of earth—
Why? Because earth and metal mutually generate,
Nurturing the sprouts and buds.
In the eighth month, the *Tiānwāi* is in *Yǒu*,
All plants wither—
Thus, metal overcomes wood.
Only when wood sprouts does my elixir’s Dao rise,
Like buds on metal’s surface,
Yellow as the sprouts,
Stained with color,
Responding to the central realm’s yellow sprout.

Thus it is said:
*The yellow sprout is what lead and mercury create.
The *Yin* shell contains the *Yang* essence—
Without the yellow sprout, one is far from the Golden Elixir.*

The world does not know
To proceed from One to Five,
Cyclically merging the Five Phases—
Thus, the five colors align,
Rainbows arc in the heavenly mists,
Rising from the furnace.
Therefore, refining true water and earth
Is the key to the Dao.

*Liùwù* and *Liùjǐ* are earth.
Earth has no fixed form,
Dominates the seasons’ endings,
And corresponds to the five directions.
The world does not know
That water’s One and metal’s Four form *Wù*,
Fire’s Two and wood’s Three form *Jǐ*.
*Wù* and *Jǐ* truly unite at the center,
Fulfilling the numbers of *Yin* and *Yang*—
Only then is perfection achieved.

Thus, if *Yáng-Rén* does not depart from fire,
Then *Yáng-Rén* cannot form mist.
Like a *yīngzǐ* brooding over an egg,
When the days are complete, it gives birth to a child.
Like a man and woman uniting to conceive.
Thus it is said:
*Lonely *Yin* cannot form,
Lonely *Yang* cannot stand.*
Mercury and sand are both *Yin*—
Like two women sharing a room!

Humans are born from the union of two *qi*,
Taking the father’s essence as bone,
The mother’s blood as flesh,
Knitting into form,
And after ten months, life emerges.

The **Dao** I speak of is likewise this.

The **Zhōng-Rén** (central male) governs the **Zhōng-Nǚ** (central female),
Their union forming the body.

The **Nǚ**’s *qi* reaches a hundredfold measure—
Her secret lies in **huán jīng bǔ qì** (returning essence to nourish *qi*).

**Lí** (離)—within it holds **Yin**,
Mirroring the sun’s center containing a **yīngzǐ** (mercury) as the **Nǚ**’s blood.

**Kǎn** (坎)—within it holds **Yang**,
Mirroring the moon’s center containing a hare,
Where **Yin** reaches its peak and **Yang** is born as the **Rén**’s essence.

The **Sage** uses the **Nán-Běi** (south-north) **positions** as **drugs**,
Just as parents unite to conceive.

**Zhèn** (震)—the eldest son,
Inheriting the father’s body,
Then returning to **Duì** (兑) to become the **Nǚ**,
Harvesting the **Nǚ**’s hundredfold *qi* to forge the **elixir** and the **cauldron**.

The **cauldron**—originally, there was no cauldron;
The **drug**—originally, there was no drug.
They arise from human nature, never straying,
Yet all are drawn from the **Four Symbols**.

The **foolish** do not grasp this,
And instead create filth with **contamination**,
This is incorrect.

My **ultimate alchemical method** mirrors **Qián** (乾) and **Kūn** (坤) splitting one *qi* into **Yin** and **Yang**,
Like humans using the **inherited vital essence** of parents to be born.
Thus, it unites **day and moon**,
Embodies the **Three Powers**,
Forms the **Four Symbols**,
And harmonizes the **Five Phases**.

Five days mark one **candidate**—sixty **times**;
A **decade** again five days, and one *qi* reaches completion;
Three **decades** with six days, the **Crimson Phoenix** takes shape;
Four **decades** with nine days, the **five hues** are complete;
Six **decades** with four days, the **Four *qi*** are full.
When the **Five Phases’ *qi*** are exhausted,
Then the **sprout emerges**, and the **drug reveals its True One**.

Then come the **Thirty-Six Dragons**,
Placing the **Yǐng-Tài** (否泰) **cauldron**,
Establishing the **Tài-Yī** (太一) **Divine Chamber**,
**Kǎn** and **Lí** as **day and moon**,
**Zhèn** and **Duì** as **Dragon and Tiger**,
Thus the **True Water-Fire** and the **internal-external Yin-Yang**,
Are set within the **Divine Chamber** in the **fortified city**,
Following the law, they heed the **water clock**,
Waiting for the **one Yang line** to arise,
Moving the **completed and incomplete** **Yin-Yang**,
Applying the **cultural and martial** **lower fires** to make them **flame upward**,
Thus the **Yang *qi*** ascends, becoming **Heaven**;
My **upper water** nourishes below,
Thus the **Yin *qi*** descends, becoming **Earth**.

**Mercury**—the **figure of transformation**.
When **male and female unite**,
Each conceives the **True Essence**,
In an instant, **Sagehood** is boundless.

In ancient times, **Emperor Yán** wandered in **Shǔ**,
Awakening to the **Three-One Dao**,
Forging the **elixir** and the **cauldron**,
Riding the **Red Dragon** to ascend as an **Immortal**,
Using this **method**.

My **drug** responds to the **upper and lower strings**.
The **number of twenty-eight**,
Comprising **three hundred eighty-four *zhū*** (粒),
Every **two *liǎng* (两) two *zhū***—this is one **jīn** (斤).
It corresponds to the **sixty-four hexagrams’ lines**,
The **two strategies of Qián and Kūn**,
And thus achieves **nine refineries, seven returns**.

**The Great Return Elixir Chapter: The Gates of *Mao* and *You*—Labor Unapplied**

Remove the black, take the red,
Plunge into the **Flowering Pool**.

The **Golden Elixir**—its medicine is **True Lead**.
**True Lead** is the white bone within the northern lead.
Take eight *liǎng* to cultivate the **seed-sprout**—
It grows like a seedling.
Then, from the red, seek **Mercury**.
**Mercury** is the essence of the **Vermilion Bird** of the south.
Extract eight *liǎng* and use it with the lead.

The **Water-Fire Yin-Yang** method:
Water has an upper and an inner aspect,
Fire has a lower and an outer aspect.
On the third, fifth, and seventh days,
Add medicine and one *liǎng* of Mercury,
One bowl of water.
By the fifteenth day, the **Clouds Ascend**.

At thirty-six days,
The **Golden Phoenix** is formed.

Day and night, Yin and Yang—
The key lies in **harmonization**.
Then, within the **cauldron**, Mercury itself sprouts a yellow shoot.
After twenty-four days, gradually apply fire.

Fire must always be steady, never faltering.
When the cauldron is opened, the **True Dragon and Tiger** appear.
This is the **first binding** of the **structural method**.

Remove the black, take the red,
Plunge into the **Flowering Pool**.
Mix with **Divine Talismans** and **White Snow** for boiling.
Use four *liǎng* of snow—
That from **Ling Commandery**—
Always like fish eyes.
At **one nine**, **two nine**, **three nine**,
Observe its proper state, then cease.
At **five nine**, it is complete.

Wash with broth and clarify it,
Until it is flavorless,
Its hue like the **Azure Sky**.

Then, place it in the **Golden Wok** and roast it,
Dampen it with **Immortal Wine**—
A few drops—
Until its color turns red.
From the third day onward,
Return it to the fire,
Place it in the cauldron,
Face the furnace while seated,
Counting **two, three, four, five**—
The two halves become distinct.
Every five days, stir and cease,
Then resume from the **Li** position above.
The **Mao** and **You** gates—
Fire must not be applied there.
Only in the **south and north** is the work refined.

The **Yin-fire** is external,
The **Yang-fire** is upright.
When it emerges, let the **dew-wind** enter subtly,
And ensure the cauldron is **firmly sealed and unyielding**.

When the medicine is complete,
It moves like breathing.
At one hundred twenty days, open the furnace—
This is the **Lesser Return Elixir**.
Taking it removes ten thousand ailments,
And the **Gushing Spring** dries up.

The **cauldron’s secret**—
This cannot be conveyed by written words.

**The Golden Book, Jade Mirror Chapter**

The essence is complete within me—
Seek nothing from without.
The inner minister holds the cauldron,
Covered by the **flowering canopy**.

He who cultivates the Inner Elixir
Must first rectify his furnace.
The furnace is the **external Kun** of the cauldron#1,
My body is this.
Within it lies the medicine of longevity—
My **spirit-qi** and **essence-fluid** are this.

The furnace has eight gates—why so?
My eyes, my ears, my nostrils—
These are the keys to vision, hearing, inhalation, and exhalation.
Discard the false and guard the true,
Do not let flavors and evils invade within.
Thus, in the **Heaven-Earth furnace** and the **Transformative cauldron**,
Refine the **Supreme Medicine**,
Harmonize **Yin-Yang**,
And temper **qi-spirit**—only then will success be achieved.

The **flowering canopy** covers the cauldron—what does this mean?
Heaven is **Qian**, is **Metal**.
Its inner realm is the **Palace of the Lungs**.
Above, it is the flowering canopy;
Below, it covers the **upper reaches of the viscera**.
It communicates through the nose—**the Heavenly Gate**—
Ascending and descending breath,
Circulating essence through **Honor-Wei**,
Cycling through the **Five Viscera**,
Flowing and irrigating the body.
Its movements—floating, sinking, large, small—are fixed.
They follow the **celestial motion of stars and constellations**,
The **terrestrial flow of rivers and seas**.
Thus, the Heavenly Gate governs the lungs,
Drawing in **pure qi** as the cauldron’s canopy.

Earth is the **cauldron’s belly**,
Transforming all things—why so?
Earth is **Kun**.
Its inner realm is **spleen and stomach**,
Encompassing water and grain,
Communicating upward through the mouth.
The mouth is the **Throat Gate**, Earth’s door,
Receiving and storing water and grain,
Descending into the **stomach’s conduit**.
Thus, the spleen receives the **ascending and descending qi** of the Heavenly Gate,
Turning and refining, transforming water and grain,
And separating the **pure from the turbid**.
The pure grain ascends to the **upper burner**—the **Palace of Heart and Lungs**—
And becomes **spirit-qi and essence-fluid**.
The turbid grain descends to the **large and small intestines**.
Thus, the stomach is the **Transformative cauldron**,
The mouth is the **Earthly furnace**,
The nose is the **Heavenly Gate**.
The **Mysterious Female** at the center—
Her name is **Ren Zhong**.
These are the **Three Talents**: Heaven, Earth, Man.

The **Heavenly Gate’s** breath-qi
Corresponds above to the **degrees of stars and constellations**.
The **Earthly Door’s** flowing waters
Respond internally to the **blood**—
Thus, one may discuss the principles of **Sun-Moon, Yin-Yang**.

The **Sun** dwells above, is exalted—
Heaven’s **Soul**, the **Fire-Essence of the Great Yang**.
Its position resides in **Qian-Gèn**,
Reigning in summer, declining in winter,
Short nights, long days.
Within it hides **Yin-qi**,
Concealing the **Hidden Golden Parrot**—
The **Parrot** is **You**.
Externally, it corresponds to the **Metal-Stone of the West**,
Which gives birth to **Water**.
**Qian** is Heaven, is Metal.
**Gèn** is the **mountain-stone’s core**—
This is **Yin within Yang**.
Its inner realm is the **upper burner**,
The **Heavenly Heart’s sacred symbol**.
The head is **Gèn’s mountain**;
The mouth is the **valley’s cavern**—
This is where water emerges!
Thus, water is the **accumulated Yin-qi of Kun**.
It ascends to the **upper heavens**,
Overwhelms the **flowering canopy**,
And as **rain and dew**, it nourishes the heart—
This is **Yin within Yang**.

**Li** is externally Yang, internally Yin,
Externally the **Noble**, internally the **Commoner**,
Like **cinnabar** belonging to fire yet hiding **mercury** within—
This is the **Great Yin’s Elderly Maiden’s spirit**,
Her robe five-colored.
**Li** is **adornment**.
Its essence is the **Sun**, five-colored and resplendent,
With the **Vermilion Palace** above, communicating to the eyes.
The eyes are the **Palace of the Mud Ball**,
Within which lies the **Spirit**.
The **Spirit** is the **Master of Heaven-Earth**,
The **Soul of Ten Thousand Things**.
To cultivate life, first clarify the spirit—
When the spirit is pure and upright, ten thousand evils cannot intrude.
This is the **Great Elixir of Longevity**.
If one cannot subdue the heart,
Internal **false fire** arises—
Like cinnabar that does not die,
Yet flies when exposed to flame.
Thus it is said:
*The heart is the master of life.*

The **Moon** dwells below, is humble—
Earth’s **Spirit**, the **Water-Essence of the Great Yin**.
Its position resides in **Kun-Xùn**,
Reigning in winter, declining in summer,
Short days, long nights.
Within it hides **Yang-Essence**, concealing the **Jade Rabbit**—
The **Rabbit** is **Mao**.
Leaning on the **束 wood of the East**,
It gives birth to **Fire**—
This is **Yang within Yin**.
Its inner realm is the **lower burner**,
Within the viscera, the **kidneys**.
The kidneys are two:
The **Central** is the **Dan Tian**.
The **Front** is the **Xùn Sea**, the **Water Palace**.
Thus, rivers and lakes converge in **Xùn**.
The world does not know the **true positions of Yin-Yang**,
Claiming the North is **Kàn**, the South is **Li**—
This is incorrect!
**Kàn** is the position of **Kun-Xùn in the South**.
The **odd Yang within Kàn** is the **Southern fire of Sì-Wǔ**.
**Li** is the position of **Qian-Gèn in the North**.
The **even Yin within Li** is the **Northern water of Hài-Zǐ**.

The Moon is externally Yin, internally Yang,
Externally the **Commoner**, internally the **Noble**—
Like **lead and tin**!
Thus, within Yin, **white silver** is produced,
And within the **water of stones and minerals**, **red gold** is enclosed.
Gold and silver are both **Yang within Yin**—
The so-called **Infant**.
Thus, above, it unites with the **Great Yin’s Elderly Maiden** within cinnabar,
As husband and wife, their affinity intertwined—
And they congeal into **cinnabar**.

Thus, **Kàn** is the **Sea of Water**, the **Palace of the Dragon**,
Where the **Emperor resides at the Northern Gate**,
Facing south in sovereign majesty.
The Moon is Earth.
Without its Yang, ten thousand things would not flourish.
All things receive from Heaven and grow toward the Sun—
This too is their constant way.

「The one who corresponds to humanity is the **soul of all things**? One must align with **Heaven’s Dao/Way**.

**Heaven’s Dao/Way** resides within its own body—
Thus, **pure Yang, true unity**,
**pure and natural qi**,
May lead to **long life**.
How does one attain **long life**?
By **day and night refining**—
Hence, **inner cultivation for one day** equals **one year of Heaven’s movement**.

Thus, **ascending and descending Yin and Yang**,
Operate within the **four seasons and twelve times**.
By day, it responds to **spring and summer**,
By night, it follows **autumn and winter**.
From dawn to dusk, this is the **harmonious exchange of Heaven and Earth**.

Therefore, the hours of **Hài (11 PM–1 AM)**, **Zǐ (1 AM–3 AM)**, and **Chǒu (3 AM–5 AM)**—
Their response is to **Heaven’s winter**.
**Yin ascends** to the **Heavenly Heart**,
**Yang descends** to the **Water Palace**,
Nurturing the **kidneys** and refining the **bones**,
Thus forming **golden sinews and jade marrow**—
And the **True Person** is born.

It is like **mountains and stones**,
Silently receiving the **transformation of ascending and descending Yin and Yang**,
And becoming **gold, silver, pearls, jade, cinnabar, copper, iron**!

The hours of **Yín (5 AM–7 AM)**, **Mǎo (7 AM–9 AM)**, and **Chén (9 AM–11 AM)**—
Their response is to **Heaven’s spring**.
**Yin descends** beneath the **Flowery Canopy**,
**Yang ascends** above the **Steaming Cauldron**,
Nurturing the **liver** and fostering the **sinews and vessels**,
Like **plants and trees** silently receiving the **warmth of Yang**,
And becoming **blossoms, leaves, sprouts, and tendrils**!

The hours of **Wèi (11 AM–1 PM)**, **Wǔ (1 PM–3 PM)**, and **Yǒu (3 PM–5 PM)**—
Their response is to **Heaven’s summer**.
**Yang descends** to the **Water Palace**,
**Yin reaches its peak** in the **Fire Palace**,
Nurturing the **heart** and refining the **blood** into **white milk**.

The hours of **Shēn (5 PM–7 PM)**, **Yǒu (7 PM–9 PM)**, and **Xū (9 PM–11 PM)**—
Their response is to **Heaven’s autumn**.
**Yang reaches its peak and descends** to **Heaven**,
**Yin returns and ascends** to **Earth**,
Nurturing the **spleen** and refining the **skin and flesh**.

Thus, **day and night respond to the four seasons**,
And **Yin and Yang are refined within one body**—
So one ascends from the **common to the sacred**.
Yet one must not fail to know the **principles of sovereign and minister, husband and wife**.

In terms of my **inner realm**:
The **body** is the **state**;
The **head** is the **city**;
The **eyes, ears, mouth, and nose** are the **four gates**;
The **four limbs** are the **four directions’ soldiers and defenses, without neglect**.

The **heart** is the **state’s sovereign**;
**Qi** is the **minister**.
Thus, the **heart is the master of qi**, and **qi is the servant of the heart**.
When the **heart’s spirit is clear and still**,
Then the **original qi** becomes harmonious and tranquil.
When **spirit and qi unite**,
Then **long life** is achieved.
It is like a **sovereign being holy** while the **minister remains loyal**,
Or a **minister being clear** while the **land prospers in order**.

I observe the **inner realm’s sovereign**—
The **pure, original, true unity qi** of the **Vermilion Palace**.
Its **minister** is the **dark, mysterious fluid** of the **Kàn Palace**.

**Heaven descends true qi**, transforming and giving birth to all things—
Like the **sovereign’s benevolence toward its minister**.
**Yin ascends from the north**, condensing into **rain and dew**,
Moistening and nourishing all things—
Like the **minister’s aid to the sovereign**.

The **sovereign** is the **heart**.
The **heart is connected to the tongue**,
And below it lies the **Jade Pool**—
To the left, **golden essence**,
To the right, **jade fluid**—
This is the **dark, mysterious fluid**.

When it **ascends and descends above**,
It becomes **rain and dew, deep springs**,
To irrigate and submerge the **heart**—
Then the **heart is vitalized**,
This is called the **sovereign obtaining its minister**.

The **minister** is the **kidneys**.
At the **center of the two kidneys** lies the **Cinnabar Field**.
Its **front** is the **Perverse Sea**—
The **Water Palace**—
Its **qi** originally arises from **Lí (fire)**,
Descending below to nurture the **Cinnabar Field**—
This is called the **sovereign hidden at the Northern Gate**.

Thus, when the **sovereign is holy and the minister is virtuous**, the **state thrives in splendor**;
When the **heart is clear and the qi is pure**, the **body attains long life**.

To govern the **state**, one must first govern the **body**;
To cultivate the **Dao/Way**, one must first clarify the **heart’s spirit**,
Then regulate the **original qi**—
This is **one principle**.

I have often explained this to my household:
The **body** is the **home**;
The **five viscera** are the **palaces**;
**Qián (heaven)** is the **father**;
**Kūn (earth)** is the **mother**;
**Kàn (water)** is the **middle son**;
**Lí (fire)** is the **middle daughter**;
**Zhèn (thunder)** is the **eldest son**;
**Xùn (wind)** is the **eldest daughter**;
**Gèn (mountain)** is the **younger son**;
**Duì (joy)** is the **younger daughter**.

**Qián (heaven)** as father and **Kūn (earth)** as mother—
They form a **pair**.
The **three sons and three daughters**—
They are **husband and wife**.

The **liver** is the **Gathering Palace**, **wood**#2.
**Jia (甲, wood’s first branch)** is its **elder brother**;
**Yǐ (乙, wood’s second branch)** is its **younger sister**.
**Jia** takes itself as wife,
**Yǐ** takes **Gēng (庚, metal’s first branch)** as husband—
Thus the **liver obtains water and sinks**.
Why?
Because **wood carries the qi of metal**.」

The **lung** is the **Western Palace**, **metal**.
**Gēng (庚, metal’s first branch)** is its **elder brother**;
**Xīn (辛, metal’s second branch)** is its **younger sister**.
**Gēng** takes **Yǐ (乙, wood’s second branch)** as wife,
**Xīn** takes **Bǐng (丙, fire’s first branch)** as husband—
Thus the **lung obtains water and floats**.
Why?
Because **metal carries the qi of fire**.

The **heart** is the **Southern Palace**, **fire**.
**Bǐng (丙, fire’s first branch)** is its **elder brother**;
**Dīng (丁, fire’s second branch)** is its **younger sister**.
**Bǐng** takes **Xīn (辛, metal’s second branch)** as wife,
**Dīng** takes **Rén (壬, water’s first branch)** as husband—
Thus the **heart can repel fire**.
Why?
Because **fire carries the qi of water**.

The **kidney** is the **Northern Palace**, **water**.
**Rén (壬, water’s first branch)** is its **elder brother**;
**Guǐ (癸, water’s second branch)** is its **younger sister**.
**Rén** takes **Dīng (丁, fire’s second branch)** as wife,
**Guǐ** takes **Wù (戊, earth’s first branch)** as husband—
Thus the **kidney can repel water**.
Why?
Because **water carries the qi of earth**.

The **spleen** is the **Central Official**, **earth**.
**Wù (戊, earth’s first branch)** is its **elder brother**;
**Jǐ (己, earth’s second branch)** is its **younger sister**.
**Wù** takes **Guǐ (癸, water’s second branch)** as wife,
**Jǐ** takes **Jia (甲, wood’s first branch)** as husband—
Thus the **spleen can receive grains**.
Why?
Because **earth carries the qi of wood**.

This is the crucible of my **造化** [transformation-nurture]. The **sovereign and minister** in the realm, the **husband and wife** in the family, the **spirit and qi** in the body—these are the **Dao of longevity and eternal vision**, unchanging from ancient times to now. Here, I must know the **true form of the inner realm**.

What is the **inner realm**? It is the **domain of the body**. What is the **true form**? It is the **furnace of my body**, within which reside **heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, winds and clouds, the Milky Way, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees**.

**Heaven** is **Qián** [the Creative, Heaven], **metal**, the **flowery canopy**, dwelling above all phenomena—this is the **inner realm’s lung**. The **stars, constellations, sun, and moon** that circulate are the **upper burner** of the inner realm, the **pathways of the Honorable and Defensive Qi**.

The **uppermost void of the Mysterious Realm** condenses the **pure qi of Upper Clarity**, while the **lower Mysterious Realm** gathers and scatters **impure qi**. The division of **pure and impure above and below** is the **middle burner**, the **sieve and partition**. Above the sieve, the **domain of pure contention**; below it, the **realm of filth and turbidity**.

The **Five Peaks and clustered mountains** are the **head**; the **ravines and valleys** are the **mouth and nose**; the **springs and sources** are the **saliva and fluids**, the **drink and food**; the **rivers rushing into the great sea** are the **accumulation of drink and food in the Water-Grain Storehouse**; the **clouds and rain nourishing the mountains and rivers** are the **hair and fur**.

If one seeks to know the **Dao of heaven and earth’s enduring longevity**, it is through attaining the **True One, the Authentic One**. What does this mean? It is the **fusion of yin and yang within the crucible of heaven and earth**, preserving the **original qi** without loss.

Mankind is born of **heaven and earth**, combining their **essence** to become their child. Thus, the **inner realm** also holds the **Dao of heaven and earth’s enduring longevity**. Without embracing the **Dao of heaven and earth** and mastering the **functions of yin and yang**, how could one preserve their **natural lifespan**?

To recognize within the inner realm the **fusion of heaven and earth, the nurturing of yin and yang, the spirit and qi, the fluids and essences**, and await the **fulfillment of sun and moon**—this is the path to enduring longevity. Knowing how to achieve this, how could one ignore the **transmutations of the Five Phases**?

The **Five Phases** are the **Five Viscera**. The **liver** is the **束方 [束, bind; 方, direction] Shèn Palace**, **Jia-Yi [甲乙, wood’s first and second branches]**, the **Azure Dragon**; the **lung** is the **Western Fú Palace**, **Gēng-Xīn [庚辛, metal’s first and second branches]**, the **White Tiger**; the **heart** is the **Southern Lí Palace**, **Bǐng-Dīng [丙丁, fire’s first and second branches]**, the **Vermilion Bird**; the **kidney** is the **Northern Kǎn Palace**, **Rén-Guǐ [壬癸, water’s first and second branches]**, the **Dark Tortoise**; the **spleen** is the **Central Kūn Palace**, **Wù-Jǐ [戊己, earth’s first and second branches]**.

I possess this **crucible**, with which I harmonize the **Four Symbols**, and the **Five Phases transmute into one another**. **Water** is **fluid**; within the fluid is **metal**, hence it is called **metallic fluid**. **Metal subdues wood, wood generates fire, fire refines metal**. The **Four Symbols** return in cycles, all originating from **earth**.

**Earth** governs the **spirit**; the **spirit**, when aligned with the **Dao**, becomes **immortal**; when straying from it, becomes **ghoulish**. The **cultivator of the True** should abandon **luxury, distance desires, reject pungent meats**, seek **clarity and tranquility, roam freely**, dwell in **rocky gorges**, maintain **pure abstinence**, ascend the **platform**, enter the **chamber**, choose the **auspicious day**, await the **moment**, face **south toward the sun**, close the eyes, sit level, grasp firmly, quiet the mind, and open the **furnace’s gate** to **stir the fire’s timing**. Thus, the **Five Viscera are refined**, the **hundred bones transform**, and only then does one attain **sacred efficacy and spiritual metamorphosis**. Though this requires **nine cycles** to complete the **fulfilled work** and ascend as **immortal**.

One cycle is **four months**; three cycles complete a **year**. When the **nine refineries’ work is complete**, then in **three years**, the **elixir is formed**. Its **size is one inch**, its **weight one jin**, with **yin and yang each half**.

It corresponds externally to the **Sixty-Four Hexagrams of the Great Ease**, **three hundred eighty-four lines**. Why? The **four hexagrams** are **twenty-four zhu** [a small weight unit]; one **liǎng** is **twenty-four zhu**, so four hexagrams make one **liǎng**, and **sixteen hexagrams** make one **jin**. The **nine cycles** mark the **initial stage of immortality**, at which **calamities no longer afflict**, **cold and heat do not invade**, **water and fire cause no harm**, and **malevolent essences vanish**. Those who can **alter form and transform body** to enter **sacredness** are **mid-stage immortals**.

Only when the **great work reaches its mystical transformation**, the **true qi becomes purely yang**, does one then **ascend to pay homage to the Celestial Sovereign**.

**Essentials for Cultivating the True:**

Follow the **four seasons**, gather the **Five Phases**;
Ask of **metal and wood**, and in **a thousand days**, it is complete.

**Disciple Wang Tíngyáng**, son of **Master Lǐ Hǎitán**, said:
*The Dao has no name; its origin is natural. One generates from the **One**—the **One** is the **element of the Dao**; the **One generates Two**—the **Two** are **heaven and earth**; the **Two generate Three**—the **Three** are the **Three Powers**, and from this all things are born. Thus, **heaven** is **father**; **earth** is **mother**; **man** is **male and female**. The **father’s essence is yang**; the **mother’s blood is yin**; when combined to form man, the **Three Powers** all originate from **one qi**.

Thus, the **One** is the **root of longevity**. The *Classic of Change* says:
*"Heaven and earth interact to generate **Kǎn [water] and Lí [fire]**; those who practice take their symbols."*

Though many cultivate the body and nurture life, few attain the **Dao**. Why? They fail to **fathom the Sage’s intent** and are **misled by hearsay**. Thus, theories of **abstaining from grains, gargling, swallowing mist, inhaling qi, pulling the body, drinking milk, and breath-retention** are not the **essential Dao**—they are like those who **search for pearls in the mountains**!

What I call **essential** is:
**Cultivate the True One**, gather the **Five Phases**, arrange the **Eight Hexagrams**, unite the **Four Symbols**, encompass the **Three Powers**.

**Qián [Heaven] and Kūn [Earth]** are my **crucible**; **Kǎn [water] and Lí [fire]** are my **elixir**.
**Hexagram Lún [Concealment]** and **Méng [Youth]**, arising at **dawn and dusk**;
**Hexagram Jìjí [Accomplishment]** and **Wèijí [Unaccomplished]**, never erring at **new moon or full moon**.

The **sequence of days** cycles endlessly—**a thousand days**, and success is achieved.

I have composed **a hundred verses**, distilling their **essence** into **twelve key poems**:

**The First:**
The **Black Tortoise and White Hare** mark the days and months,
Yet none **grasp the vital bond** of **life and nature**.
Seize the **union of Earth and Heaven** in **Harmony**—
Then **qi** flows naturally through **Kǎn [water]** and **Lí [fire]**.

**The Second:**
The **worldly rush** to seek the **True One** in vain,
Mixing **cinnabar** and **mercury** in folly’s chain.
They fail to **refine their own bodily elixir**—
**Mercury** lingers dead, yet **life** is lent to others.

**The Third:**
The **circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit** is **subtle and profound**,
Its **movement and pause** follow **timed precision**.
The **seventy-two seasonal shifts** must not falter—
Then **naturally**, the **Tiger and Dragon** are subdued.

**The Fourth:**
Not in **markets** nor in **mountains** is it found,
Nor bound by **fame or idleness**—**freedom** is its ground.
If mortals seek the **elixir of longevity**,
Only **heart-ash** transmuted is the **Great Return**.

**The Fifth:**
**Yin** belongs to **Earth**, **Yang** to **Heaven**,
One leads to **ghostly realms**, the other to **immortality**.
To **refine** is to **discern the hidden and manifest**—
**Life and death** are intertwined before your eyes.

**The Sixth:**
The **Golden Elixir’s secret** seizes **Heaven’s authority**,
Its **root** lies **plainly** before you.
Wipe away the **North’s Black Tortoise**—what **mystery** remains?
Why does the **Tortoise and Dragon** coil in endless chains?

**The Seventh:**
When **hair turns white and temples gray**, tell them this:
Yet they still **covet greedily**, lost in **chaos**.
They fail to **harmonize the Five Phases** with **sun and moon**—
At this **hour of suffering**, who will they blame?

**The Eighth:**
**Water and Fire** share **affinity**, yet **Wood and Metal**?
**Fire and Water** know where to **seek**—but where?
Why **strip yellow** to don **purple**?
Only the **River Vehicle’s** revolutions run deep.

**The Ninth:**
The **Five Phases** and **Four Symbols**, **Kǎn** and **Lí** combined,
The **verse’s secret** is **clearly** spoken—
Yet where **practice** begins, few **grasp**, few **know**.

**The Tenth:**
The **crucible’s fire** must be **meticulously** refined,
Until **pure qi** ascends from within.
When the **Earthly Gate** is **quiet**, the **marrow is full**—
The **Heavenly Gate** then **opens** of its own accord.

**The Eleventh:**
Once the **seeker awakens** to **cultivate the True One**,
They must **seek the method** and **guard against harm**.
Even **water** struggles to **contain fire**—
How much more when **ghostly influences** lurk beside?

**The Twelfth:**
If you have not yet **met a teacher**, study these verses,
For within them lies the **secret** for **cultivation**.
Though you may not **reach Penglai’s path**,
You will **delay death’s reckoning** by asking others.

**Volume Twenty-Two of the *Dao Gun***
*(Compiled by the wandering scholar Zeng Kuo)*

**On Alchemical Cultivation: The Nine Cauldrons and Eight Trigrams**

Cultivate within the **Nine Cauldrons**,
Walk the **Eight Trigrams**—
Nurture and rest to **manifest the Spirit**,
Merge with the **Creative Transformation**.

The **Great Elixir** depends solely on **nurturing and resting to manifest the Spirit**.

Now, **breath**—each day holds **thirty-six thousand**,
Circulating through the **Thirty-Six Passes**,
The **Black-and-White Paths** of **Four Sixes**,
Moving through the **Eight Trigrams**,
Refined in the **Nine Cauldrons**.

A single day comprises **twelve hours**,
Each hour **eight *kè* and seventeen *fēn***—
My **four breaths** make one **cycle**,
Sufficient to traverse the **Thirty-Six Passes** and **Four Orifices**.

Each **Pass or Orifice** requires **two *kè* and five *fēn*** of breath flow,
Thus, one hour holds **three thousand breaths**,
One *kè* holds **three hundred sixty breaths**.

The **twelve hours** further divide into **four seasons**,
Where **flourishing, decline, birth, and conquest** unfold.

What are the **Thirty-Six Passes**?
- The **Lower Dantian** is the **Suxiua Pass**,
- The **Huangzhong Orifice** is the **Five Paths Pass**,
- The **Weifeng Orifice** is the **Cuiwei Pass**,
- The **Tianzhu Orifice** is the **Zhanchen Pass**,
- The **Anus** is the **Yuanmen Pass**,
- The **Nurturing Sphere** is the **Taiyi Pass**,
- The **Xuanying Orifice** is the **Haiquan Pass**,
- The **Twelve Pavilions** are the **Three Elements Pass**,
- The **Lungs** are the **White Tiger Pass**,
- The **Liver** is the **Green Dragon Pass**,
- The **Heart** is the **Pengxiao Pass**,
- The **Spleen** is the **Central Yellow Pass**,
- The **Twenty-Four Hammers**—all are **Passes**.

The **first day** receives **flourishing**,
The **second** **communicates with the Primordial**,
The **third** **achieves Jade Frost**,
The **fourth** **gathers the Seven Stars**,
The **fifth** **attains the Guardian Spirit**,
The **sixth** **illuminates the Bright Hall**,
The **seventh** **draws the Auspicious Spring**,
The **eighth** **opens the Gate of Life**,
The **ninth** **advances to the City**,
The **tenth** **roots in *Kūn***,
The **eleventh** **honors the Sovereign Lord**,
The **twelfth** **holds the Jade Tablet**,
The **thirteenth** **ascends the Red Citadel**,
The **fourteenth** **glorifies the Golden**,
The **fifteenth** **pierces the Dragon**,
The **sixteenth** **refines the Jade Elixir**,
The **seventeenth** **reaches the Jade Terrace**,
The **eighteenth** **fountains the Golden Spring**,
The **nineteenth** **fortifies the Golden City**,
The **twentieth** **surging to the Heavens**,
The **twenty-first** **rides the Golden Phoenix**,
The **twenty-second** **soars the Frozen Expanse**,
The **twenty-third** **converges the Primordial**,
The **twenty-fourth** **gathers the Hundred Jewels**.

What are the **Four Orifices**?
- The **Liver** is the **Ram’s Chariot**—
  Ride it to **audience the Jade Emperor** and **convene the myriad spirits**,
  Its name: the **Pengying Orifice**.
- The **Kidneys** are the **Deer’s Chariot**—
  Ride it to **audience Kunlun**,
  Its name: the **Sanfeng Orifice**.
- The **Heart** is the **Great Ox Chariot**—
  Ride it to **tame the Fire Dragon** and **enter Penglai**,
  Its name: the **Shouzong Orifice**.
- The **Spleen** is the **Earth**—
  **Anchored in the four directions**, with **metal and water** flanking it,
  Its name: the **Baocheng Orifice**.

What are the **Black-and-White Paths**?
They are the **White Metal** and **Black Tiger**—
The **yin-yang qi** of **Nourishing and Defensive Circulations**.

The **outflow** is **Nourishing**,
The **inflow** is **Defensive**.
Each **breath**—**out and in**—lasts **ten days**,
Yet within a single breath lie **four cycles**.

In **winter**, the **yang is received internally**,
Corresponding to the **Child, Ox, Tiger hours**—
Thus, **thirteen thousand breaths** traverse the **White Nourishing Path**,
And **twenty-three thousand breaths** traverse the **Black Defensive Path**.

In **spring**, the **yang is also received internally**,
Corresponding to the **Rabbit, Dragon, Snake hours**—
Thus, **sixteen thousand breaths** traverse the **White Nourishing Path**,
And **twenty thousand breaths** traverse the **Black Defensive Path**.

In **summer**, the **yin is received internally**,
Corresponding to the **Horse, Sheep, Monkey hours**—
Thus, **eighteen thousand breaths** traverse the **White Nourishing Path**,
And **eighteen thousand breaths** traverse the **Black Defensive Path**.

In **autumn**, the **yin is also received internally**,
Corresponding to the **Rooster, Dog, Pig hours**—
Thus, **twenty thousand breaths** traverse the **White Nourishing Path**,
And **sixteen thousand breaths** traverse the **Black Defensive Path**.

What are the **Eight Trigrams and Nine Cauldrons**?
- In the **Child, Ox, Tiger hours**, **Kān** is the **Yang Cauldron**—
  The **True Yin** takes effect.
- In the **Rabbit, Dragon, Snake hours**, **Zhèn** is the **Yang Cauldron**—
  **Wood** takes effect.
- In the **Horse, Sheep, Monkey hours**, **Lí** is the **Yin Cauldron**—
  **Heaven** takes effect.
- In the **Rooster, Dog, Pig hours**, **Duì** is the **Metal Cauldron**—
  **Duì** takes effect.

The **Ox hour**: **Earth rules and takes effect**,
Converging at the **Central Palace**.
**Gèn** is the **Cauldron**, drawing **True Essence** from the **gallbladder**—
The **yang qi** is the **embryo**.

The **Dragon hour**: **Earth rules and takes effect**,
Converging at the **Central Palace**.
**Zhèn** uses **Xùn** as the **Cauldron**—
The **Green Dragon** performs its function.
Thus, the **first nine yang** generate **water**—
The **Zhèn qi** prevails,
And **Duì** stands upright as the **Cauldron**—**wind** itself.

The **Sheep hour**: **Earth rules and takes effect**,
**Gèn** governs the **bladder**, drawing **True Essence**—
**Gèn** is the **Cauldron**—
The **Gèn-generating qi** is **fire**,
Born from the **earthly mountain**.

The **Dog hour**: **Earth rules and takes effect**,
The **Metal Cauldron** stands upright,
**Xùn** as the **Furnace**—
This is the **Metal-Stone Cauldron**,
For **Kān** is the **large intestine**,
Named **Metal-Stone**—where **metal converges**.

Thus, the **twelve hours** embody the **metal, wood, and earth qi**,
Responding to the **Three Powers’ Nine Cauldron positions**,
Stealing the **Heaven-Earth Creative Transformation’s function**!

**Heaven and Earth** are the **Kān-Kūn symbols**.
The **Five Phases and Eight Trigrams**,
Mingled and returning to the **Primordial Unity**,
Form the **Great Harmony**—
The **Heaven-Earth Trigram**.

This is the **Eight Trigrams, Nine Cauldrons’ count**—
The **Heaven-Earth union**,
The **Eight Trigrams’ Five Phases’ Heavenly Circulation**.

Observe how the **Five Phases** of **birth, conquest, flourishing, and decline**
Divide into **four seasons** and take effect—
Why so?
Within **Child, Ox, Tiger**,
**Water rules and conquers Fire**,
Yet it **nourishes Wood**—
Is this not **Fire’s mother**?

Thus, the **wood qi** supplements its **fire timing**—
Only when **fire qi** is full does it take effect.
Within **Mao, Chen, Si**,
**Wood reigns** and conquers **Earth**,
Then **generates Fire**—
Is this not **Earth’s mother**?
With **Fire qi** supplementing **Earth**,
Wait until **Earth qi** is full before taking effect.

Within **Wu, Wei, Shen**,
**Fire reigns** and conquers **Metal**,
Then **generates Earth**—
Is this not **Metal’s mother**?
With **Earth qi** supplementing **Metal**,
Wait until **Metal qi** is full before taking effect.

Within **You, Xu, Hai**,
**Metal reigns** and conquers **Wood**,
Yet it **generates Water**—
Is this not **Wood’s mother**?
With **Water qi** supplementing **Wood**,
Wait until **Wood qi** is full before taking effect.

This is the **essential principle** of the **Five Phases’ mutual generation and conquest**.

One **hour** contains **three thousand breaths**—
Passing through **three passes and two marks** becomes **eight breaths and two arrivals**,
This is the **Heavenly Circulation’s fire timing**.

Its essence lies in **beginning with One Yang as sovereign**.

At the **Child hour**, One Yang first arises—
The **initial nine**—
Born in the **Substance-Bloom Palace**,
Rising as **Moon**—
This is the **Dragon hidden in Water**,
Arriving at the **Peng-Xiao, Azure Dragon Passes**.

At the **Ox hour**, its **qi** resides in the **White Tiger, Three Primordials, Sea Spring Passes**—
This is **Wood generating Fire**.

At the **Tiger hour**, its **qi** is in the **Tai-Yi, Primordial Gate, Reel-Carp Passes**.

At the **Rabbit hour**, its **qi** is in the **White Crystal, Gathering Primordials, Ice-Xiao Passes**.

At the **Dragon hour**, its **qi** is in the **Golden Phoenix, Piercing Heaven, Golden City Passes**.

At the **Snake hour**, its **qi** is in the **Golden Water, Jade Tower, Jade Bud Passes**.

At the **Horse hour**, its **qi** is in the **Piercing Dragon, Honoring Metal, Vermilion City Passes**—
Here, **True Yin** first arises.

At the **Sheep hour**, its **qi** is in the **Jade Tablet, Imperial Sovereign, Kūn Primordial Passes**.

At the **Monkey hour**, its **qi** is in the **Advancing City, Command Gate, Auspicious Spring Passes**.

At the **Rooster hour**, its **qi** is in the **Bright Hall, Guardian Spirit, Seven Stars Passes**.

At the **Dog hour**, its **qi** is in the **Jade Crystal, Communing Primordials, Receiving Abundance Passes**.

At the **Pig hour**, its **qi** is in the **Emerald Mists, Five Paths, Yellow Bell Passes**.
Then its **qi** reverses, returning to **Substance-Bloom**.
This is the **Heavenly Circulation**.

When in **Child, Ox, Tiger hours**, sit quietly, **breathing and observing**,
Close your eyes and **internally gaze** upon the **Five Viscera**,
Imagine your **liver** holding the **Azure Dragon**,
Coiling like mist and dew—
Its emergence is faint—
With intent, **guide the qi** downward to the **heart palace**,
Then imagine the **heart palace** holding the **Vermilion Bird**,
Close your mouth to **receive its qi**—
If the **Azure Dragon’s qi** is faint,
**Retain the breath thirty-six times**,
To **subdue the heart’s fire** before practicing.

When in **Rabbit, Dragon, Snake hours**, also sit quietly and **settle the breath**,
Close your eyes and **internally gaze** upon the **Five Viscera**,
Imagine your **heart** holding **crimson qi**, coiling,
Sinking to the **lungs’ upper region**,
Then imagine the **spleen’s upper region** holding **Gou-Chen**,
Close your mouth to **receive its qi**—
If the **qi** is faint, **inhale thirty times**,
To **subdue the spleen’s Earth** before practicing.

When in **Horse, Sheep, Monkey hours**, also sit quietly, **breathing and observing**,
Close your eyes and **internally gaze** upon the **Five Viscera**,
Imagine your **spleen** holding **yellow qi**, coiling,
With intent, **guide it upward to the lungs**,
Then imagine the **lungs** holding the **White Tiger**,
Open your mouth to **receive its qi**,
**Retain and exhale thirty times**,
To **subdue the lungs’ Metal** before practicing.

When in **Rooster, Dog, Pig hours**, also sit quietly, **breathing and observing**,
Close your eyes and **internally gaze** upon the **Five Viscera**,
Imagine your **lower elixir field** holding the **White Tiger**, coiling,
With intent, **guide it upward to the liver**,
Then imagine the **liver** holding the **Azure Dragon**,
Open your mouth to **receive its qi**,
**Retain and exhale thirty times**,
To **subdue the liver’s Wood** before practicing.

Once the **Five Viscera** are supplemented,
One may **practice the Sun and Moon**—
Their union lies at the **cauldron’s left and right**,
One may **circulate the Eight Trigrams**.

When practicing, first **cool the spirit**,
Then imagine your **heart** holding the **Sun**—
As large as a **coin**—
Emerging from the **heart**,
Then imagine its **light illuminating the Five Viscera and hundred bones**,
Next imagine the **Sun’s form**—
If it **floats upward**, **inhale twenty breaths** and **swallow once**,
Swiftly imagine the **qi descending** through the **twelve-layered towers**,
Enveloping the **Sun**,
Sinking to the **spleen’s upper region**, the **cauldron’s left**,
Once **breathing and observing** are settled,
Then imagine the **lower elixir field’s water sea** holding the **Moon**—
As large as a **coin**—
Then imagine its **light illuminating the body**,
With intent, **guide it upward to the lungs**,
**Inhale thirty times**, turning the **head to the left** and **swallow once**,
Swiftly imagine the **qi descending** through the **twelve towers**,
Enveloping the **spleen’s upper region**,
Entering the **heart’s right**, the **cauldron’s right**,
Once **breathing and observing** are settled, then practice.

**Essentials of the Inner Golden Elixir Scripture**
Not **mercury nor lead**—
**True Unity** is the foundation.
**Know White, Preserve Black**,
And **spiritual clarity** naturally returns.

**Li Guangxuan** in youth longed for the **Dao**,
Later encountering a **sage** who told him:
*"If **Primordial Qi** does not scatter,
One may achieve **longevity**."*

**Primordial Qi**—
The **mixed unity qi** within the body,
The **root of humanity**.
**Dwelling in thought** halts the **qi**,
**Spirit moving** scatters the **qi**—
Thus, the **sage’s breathing** does not wander outside the **nose**,
**Cultivation and reflection** always reside in the **elixir field**,
If the **three fields** are full, one may reach **thousand years**.

As for **exhaling the stale and inhaling the fresh**,
**Gargling and swallowing saliva**—
These are all **methods of prolonging life and fortifying the body**.

Guanxuan practiced them for over ten years,
Yet deemed them **not the transcendent Golden Elixir method**.

Li Guangxuan then wandered to the **Mount Xiaoshi**,
And there encountered **Master Xuan Shou** and asked him:
*"**Alchemical Elixir** is that which takes **Primordial Unity** as its foundation,
Where **lead** and **mercury** rely upon each other,
And **Yellow Sprout** is its essence.
What is **Yellow Sprout**?
It sprouts from within **lead**,
Originating from **Absolute Primordial Truth**,
As **mercury** conveys the **qi of gold**—
This is what is called **Yellow Sprout**, is it not?"

Li Guangxuan said:
*"**Lead** is highly toxic—how can it become the **Supreme Medicine**?"*

**Master Xuan Shou** replied:
*"Within **lead** lies **gold**,
And within **gold** lies **treasure**.
When one sees **treasure** and recognizes **treasure**,
A **virtuous sage** attains the **Dao**—
It is better to refine **gold** within **lead**,
Than to forge **treasure** within **lead**.
This is not the **lead** of the mundane world.
Hence it is said:
**Yellow Sprout is lead**—yet it departs from **lead** by ten thousand leagues;
**Yellow Sprout is not lead**—yet it begins from **lead**.
**Lead** is the **mother** of the **sprout**,
The **sprout** is the **child** of **lead**—
The **mother** concealed within the **child’s womb**,
The **child** hidden in the **mother’s womb**—
To **know the white** and **guard the black**,
The **spirit** and **clarity** return naturally.
Thus, **one** is the **numerical essence** of **water**,
The **beginning of the Five Phases**—
Its hue aligns with the **black**,
Yet encompasses the **Five Colors** within.
Cultivate it to attain the **Dao**,
And it harmonizes with **Nature’s Way**.
It can generate **Heaven and Earth**,
Manifest as **yin and yang**—
Then **returning the essence of the sun** to the **moon’s cave**,
And **condensing the refined essence** in the **Dragon Palace**,
As **purple qi** subtly conceals itself,
And aligns with **Primordial Truth** in perfect accord.

The saying goes:
*"To use **lead**, one must use **lead**—
**Lead** is the **old elixir field**,
Do not abandon **lead**."*

Li Guangxuan asked:
*"The world considers **cinnabar** and **mercury** as **Yellow Sprout**—how is this so?"*

**Master Xuan Shou** replied:
*"This is not the speech of one who knows the **Dao**.
**Yellow Sprout** is the **union of the Water and Fire trigrams**,
Where **metal** and **water** generate each other—
**Male** and **female** in perfect balance,
**Yin** and **yang** harmoniously united,
Emerging from **non-being** into **being**,
As **yin moves** and **yang responds**—
This is **Yellow Sprout**."*

Li Guangxuan said:
*"Some say that **gold**, **silver**, and the **five leads** are **Yellow Sprout**—how is this so?"*
**Leads**: *Maopian, Xian, Ku, Hei, and Mituoseng.*
**Master Xuan Shou** replied:
*"All incorrect.
Those who take them—with their **coarse and stubborn** nature—
Will **scorch their Five Zang organs**."*

**Li Guangxuan** said:
*"What I speak of as **Yellow Sprout** is the **union of lead and mercury**,
**Metal** and **Wood** in parallel,
**Dragon** and **Tiger** intermingling,
**Water** and **Fire** restraining each other,
**Pushing** and **pulling** in harmony,
**With the spirit (po) following the soul (hun)**,
**Fulfilling** the **cause of return and transformation**,
**Illuminating** the **principle of breath (qi)**—
**Yin** and **yang** harmoniously united,
**Mother** within, **child** preserved,
**The quintessence of heaven and earth** complete.

Thus, **mercury** does not reveal its form,
**Metal** does not show its essence,
**Cinnabar**, **Wood essence**—
**When Metal is obtained**, they **merge**;
**Entering the body**, they **gather the soul**,
**The Tiger grows hungry** and then **comes to devour** the **vital marrow and fat**—
This is what I mean.

Yet, when the **time and circumstances** are **fully ripe**, they will **naturally transform**.
Hence it is said:
*'Lead, mercury, and cinnabar sprout—three flowers,
**Collect me**.*
**Qi** condenses into **sand (cinnabar)**,
**At first**, inquire about the **ten-day cycle** and **Fire’s augmentation**,
**Revolving** the **five colors** to enter the **Divine Essence**,
**Increasing** to **make the Dao without deviation**—
When the **three** are **complete**, then **one is a Daoist adept**."*

**Li Guangxuan** said:
*"Still, you have not yet grasped it."*
**Master Xuan Shou** replied:
*"The **ultimate medicine** employs only the **Five Phases**.
The **Scriptures** say:
*'Why speak of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth?
**Retaining the spirit** and **preserving life** are the **Dragon** and **Tiger**.
**Students** who do not recognize the **Five Phases’ essence**,
**Forcefully** take **others’ substances** as **parents**—

**Wood governs qi**, **bones** govern the **Tiger**,
**Blood** governs **Water**, **flesh** symbolizes **Earth**,
**The Way of immortality** lies in the **Li Palace**,
**Mastering** the **Five Phases** alone holds the key.

**The Five Phases** must be **mercury’s own kind**,
**Heterogeneous substances** cannot **endure** as **companions**.
**The Great Master He Lan** names it **‘Ball of Azure Dragon’**—

**Rising as the White Tiger**, **resting as the Dark Tortoise (Xuan Wu)**,
**Flying as the Vermilion Bird (Zhu Que)**, **seated as the Yellow Dragon**,
**The Central Official** naturally **bears fruit**;

**Mother** pities **child**, **child** pities **Mother**,
**A single cloud** forms within the **furnace**,
**Taking it as medicine**—**no matter the form**—**it is acceptable**;
This is the **Dao**."*

**Li Guangxuan** said:
*"When **consuming the elixir**, what **substances** should one use?"*

**Master Xuan Shou** said:
*"When refining the elixir, only **mercury** is needed—
passing through the **river furnace (he cha)** yields **purple powder**,
which is called **the Golden Liquid Elixir (Jin Ye Hui Dan)**."*

**Li Guangxuan** asked:
*"May I inquire, what is the **weight** of the **ultimate elixir**—
how many **qian (铢)** or **liang (两)**?
When will it be **complete**?"*

**Master Xuan Shou** replied:
*"The **cauldron** holds the **Heavenly (乾)** and **Earthly (坤)** phases—
from **Child (子)** to **Separation (离)**, this is when the **hexagram patterns** are **manifest**,
and from **Separation (离)** to **Ha (亥)**, this is when the **radiance** is **seen**,
just as the **fetus** lies in the womb or the **phoenix** in its egg—
when the **time arrives**, it **emerges**.*

*‘**Twenty-eight days** of **cohabitation**’ is the **weight** of **qian (铢)** and **liang (两)**,
*‘**One star** completing its **circuit**’* is the **seasonal timing**,
and then the **Dragon arises** and the **Tiger roars**.*

*‘**Twenty-eight days**’*—this is the **elder maiden (lao nv, 姥女)**;
*‘**Sixteen days**’*—this is the **refined lead (qian jing, 铅精)**.*

When **Yang (陽)** **emerges** and **fire ignites**,
when **Yin (陰)** **consumes** and **water is spent**, it **halts**.*

**Taoist recluse Tao Yuanming** said:
*"The **Child (子)** and **Midday (午)** gates open the **Mao (卯)** and **You (酉)**—
the **Four Seasons** **circulate fire**, aligning with **Heavenly (乾)** and **Earthly (坤)** phases,
and then the **Dragon and Tiger** **devour each other**."*

**Li Guangxuan** asked:
*"Among **‘Day Soul and Night Spirit (ri hun yue po, 日魂月魄)**—the **White Tiger and Azure Dragon (Bai Hu Qing Long, 白虎青龙)**,
**cinnabar and river furnace (dan sha he cha, 丹砂河车)**,
**true lead and true mercury (zhen qian zhen gong, 真铅真汞)**—
which is the **authentic**?"*

**Master Xuan Shou** replied:
*"They are all **one**—
none **transcend** the **Five Phases**."*

*"The world uses **stones** as **medicines**,
requiring **seventy-two** or even **over a hundred** refinery cycles,
which may **temporarily** **alleviate illnesses**,
but **cannot** be **discussed** in terms of **prolonging life**."*

**Mercury**, being **fire’s wood (huo de mu, 火之木)**,
**lead**, being **water’s metal (shui de jin, 水之金)**,
must be **refined** in the **Central Palace (Zhong Gong, 中官)**,
**harmonized** by **their kindred natures**!

*‘**In ancient times**, Lord Lingyang **knew this Dao**,
so he **paired the South with the North**,
**paired the West with the Bundle (束)**,
**aligning these four directions**,
**not deviating** from the **Central Dao (Zhong Dao, 中道)**.
**One year** to **circulate fire (yun huo, 运火)**,
**ten months** to **open the furnace (kai lu, 开炉)**,
**seven returns (qi fan, 七返)** **without loss**,
**nine cycles (jiu huan, 九还)** **sufficiently complete**—
this is when the **Dragon flies** and the **soul returns (hun fan, 魂返)**,
the **Tiger submits** and the **spirit returns (po gui, 魄归)**.
Its name is **‘The Miraculous Return of Purple Essence (Zi Se Zhi Miao Huan, 紫色之妙还)**’,
**‘The Divine Elixir of the Great Nectar (Tai Ye Zhi Shen Dan, 太液之神丹)**’."*

**Li Guangxuan**#5 asked:
*"Why does **‘Three Yellows binding sand (San Huang Jie Sha, 三黄结砂)**’ **yield gold (jin, 金)**?"*

**Master Xuan Shou**#6 replied:
*"This is the **work** of the **greedy (tan, 贪)**—
not the **pursuit** of the **Hermit of the Mystic Dao (Xi Yi, 希夷)**."*

*(Note: As per the original text’s annotations, the title is revised to **‘Great Unity (Tai Yi, 太一)**’ in the *Dao Gun Ji Yao* (道枢辑要) edition.)*

**Volume Twenty-Three of *Dao Gun* –** *"***The Daoist Master of Ultimate Wandering (Zhi You Zi, 至游子)***"*
*(Collected by **Zeng Cong (曾慥)**).*

**The Golden Elixir and Refining Gold**

When the inner *qi* does not exit and the outer *qi* does not enter,
the Yang blazes forth in its own domain, emanating from the *Li* realm.

The Dao has three aspects:
Refining the form, refining the *qi*, refining the spirit.

Its essence lies in aligning with the seasons’ opportunities,
the transformations of the Five Phases,
and the pairing of *Kan* and *Li*—
thus internally directing the Dragon and Tiger,
and filling the Three Fields with *qi*.
When mixed and perfected, a single *qi* lies dormant within the body.

Hence, when the Three Fields of Xuan Valley are filled with *qi* and enter the Mysterious,
neither bright above nor dim below,
then the refining of *qi* and merging with the spirit begins.

For *qi* is the *qi* within *qi*.
Vast and flowing, it permeates the four limbs,
soft and still, while the spirit and soul rise and soar.

When the true *qi* blends with the body and enters below the navel,
*qi* returning to the navel becomes breath,
the spirit entering the *qi* becomes the embryo,
and when breath and embryo merge,
this is called *Tai Yi* Embracing the True—
then the refining of the spirit begins.

The complete spirit has four aspects:
Mind, intention, nature, and spirit—
all rooted in the same source.

For the mind is the dwelling of the spirit.
When the spirit can embrace *qi* and return to its root,
only then can it self-preserve—
this is the beginning of entering the Sagehood.

What is the method of refining the form?
Calm the mind and regulate the breath,
let the *qi* be still and soft,
guard the spirit within its chamber—
thus the *qi* enters the *Dan Tian*—
this is refining the form.

For *qi* is the utmost essence of Yin and Yang,
the Yang soul of Heaven and Earth.
When refined into substance,
it generates spirit-*qi* and forms the symbol of *Tai Yi*.
Flowing through the hundred vessels,
it disperses throughout the body,
with the five viscera and six bowels divided into three functions—
strengthening the form, fortifying the bones,
when the *qi* settles, the spirit is born.

How else but through still-sitting can the *qi* be made to dwell?
Sit cross-legged, forget emotions and thoughts,
breathing softly and continuously,
like the breath of a tortoise.
Soon, true *qi* permeates the body,
the breath at the nostrils moves yet does not move,
dynamic yet still—
Yin embracing Yang.

Then, use the Red Dragon to strike upward seventy-two times.
When moved, Heaven’s Yang descends upon the *Li* Palace,
the *Li* Palace obtains its transformation and becomes true fire,
to refine the form—
Yin evils exit as sweat.
Thus, five times,
and it aligns with the three hundred sixty revolutions of the Heavenly Cycle.
Yang light spreads across the body,
the *qi* naturally settles,
mother and child guard internally,
bearing Yin while embracing Yang—
this is refining the *qi*—
then grasp the spirit and return to the origin.

The spirit—
when in the ears, it listens;
when in the eyes, it sees;
when in the tongue, it tastes;
when in the heart, it transforms;
when in the intention, it flashes—
the spirit wanders freely among the six senses.
If the six senses do not receive,
then the six senses naturally still,
when spirit-*qi* returns to unity,
the spirit itself becomes true—
this is the six senses entering the chamber.

Sit upright, the spirit-*qi* now settled,
no inner vision exits, no outer vision enters,
the mind holds no thought,
listening externally yet hearing nothing,
eyes closed and opened,
the spirit resides in the heart,
*qi* returns below the navel,
brain-*qi* overflows,
the tongue presses upward in surprise,
the Spirit Spring surges forth.

Hands left and right embrace the navel,
the elixir fire gently warms,
intention wanders the boundless void,
spirit-light shines of its own accord,
the six senses are tranquil,
self and objects alike forgotten—
for a long while, dim and silent,
dark and obscure,
the spirit does not regard the body,
the body does not regard the spirit—
guest and host are divided.

Within the Great Emptiness,
a light appears like an orange—
neither within nor without—
guard it and do not lose it.
Like moonlight’s glow,
like a mirror’s reflection,
store it with intention yet do not depart—
vague and internal illumination,
its light disperses naturally,
vast as a wheel.
Intention turns upward to observe,
and within, the self-form appears.
The spirit departs the body and resides in the light,
form appears in the spirit,
spirit gazes upon the body,
form and spirit regard each other,
its light disperses like moonlight on snow.

Form and spirit both wondrous,
uniting with the Dao and attaining truth—
when the spirit returns to the body, is it the True?
When it departs, is it the Numinal?

A thousand days’ work—
the body departs and ascends.
Ten thousand days’ practice—
the spirit enters.
Then, one must use the Heart Fire to nourish it.

What is Heart Fire?
Vague yet indistinct—
within it, there is substance;
dark yet profound—
within it, there is truth.

The twelve divisions of a day—
six belong to Yang, six to Yin.
When time aligns with **Zi** (子), the work of refining life begins.
**Zi** is Yang;
**Chou** (丑) is Yin.
Taking the **Dark Mother** (玄牝) for pleasure is Yang—
pleasure on the left opens the **Golden Pass** (金关),
pleasure on the right opens the **Jade Gate** (玉户).
When time aligns with **Zi**, Yin is within Yang.
The right kidney, the **Moon**—
within it lies the **qi of the Jade Rabbit** (玉兔之氣),
emerging from the right nostril,
this is the source of pleasure.

Then, first **water three** (行水三),
then **fire three** (行火三),
in accordance with **Ji Ji** (既济).
When time aligns with **Chou**, Yang is within Yin.
The left kidney, the **Sun**—
within it lies the **qi of the Golden Crow** (金乌之氣),
emerging from the left nostril,
this is the source of pleasure.

Then, first **fire three** (行火三),
then **water three** (行水三),
in accordance with **Wei Ji** (未济).
The **Classic** (經) says:
The **Great One** (太一) contains light,
right is Yin, left is Yang.
Thus, the *Yijing* (《易》) says:
One closing, one opening is called **change** (變),
endless coming and going is called **harmony** (通).
Therefore, when **qi** expands and opens—
it is Yang’s essence,
its emergence is the **Sun Soul** (日魂), the **True Fire** (真火);
when it contracts and closes—
it is Yin’s essence,
its return is the **Moon Embryo** (月魄), the **True Water** (真水).
The *Yijing* (《易》) says:
**Qian** (乾) is firm, **Kun** (坤) is yielding—
this is what is meant.

Why?
This is the **original qi** (元氣) of **Metal and Wood** (金木),
firm and yielding, divided by the **Dark Mother** (玄牝).
Sinking inward, rising outward,
ascending and descending at the breath’s turn;
**Masculine** (雄) shifts, **Feminine** (雌) follows,
uniting in the **Elixir Field** (丹田) within;
**Death’s emergence** (出死) and **Life’s return** (入生)—
all is here!

For those who wish to refine the **elixir heart** (丹心) and the **clear mirror** (明鏡),
there is a way.

When time aligns with **Zi** (子),
left ascends, right descends—
left invests, right receives.
When time aligns with **Wu** (午),
right ascends, left descends—
right invests, left receives.
One exhale from the **heart and lungs** (心与肺),
one inhale into the **kidneys and liver** (肾与肝),
one breath and one exhale connect with the **Four Viscera** (四藏),
all gathering in the **Central Palace** (中宫) at the **Steel and Earth tripod** (戊己之鼎).

I have practiced when time aligns with **Zi** (子),
sitting upright and still,
forgetting the world and observing the marvels—
sometimes facing south, sometimes facing north,
left foot raised above,
first closing my eyes,
then striking the **Heavenly Drum** (天鼓) thirty-six times,
next tapping my teeth thirty-six times,
to gather my **spirit** (神).
Then, rubbing my hands left and right seven times,
**Fire Nine Returns** (火九还),
warming my palms to smooth the **Heavenly Abode** (天宅) twenty to thirty times,
next warming the left kidney as the **Sheep Chariot** (羊车),
then warming the right kidney as the **Deer Chariot** (鹿车),
and warming below the navel as the **Great Ox Chariot** (大牛车),
each thirty-six times.
Then, guiding and drawing to move and warm my four limbs,
twisting and extending my hundred bones,
thus the **meridians and collaterals** (经络) flow freely.

Awaiting the **qi**’s harmonious flow,
then practicing **breath refinement** (吐纳),
three **swallows** (三咽) at the **Flowering Pool** (華池).
The **Dark Embryo** (玄膺) is the **shore of life and death** (生死之岸).
Entering **clarity** (清), emerging from **darkness** (玄),
the two **qi**’s exchange.
Thus, **water and fire** are the **gates of longevity** (長生之門).

The **Great Medicine** (大药) is **three hundred eighty-four catty** (三百八十四铢),
uniting the **trigrams and lines** (卦爻) in number.
At **Zi**’s moment, I gather the **Sun’s spirit** (日中之神),
its name is **Lesser Yang** (少陽).
Facing south, sitting upright,
left foot raised above,
eyes closed, forgetting the world,
both hands firmly grasp the two kidneys,
teeth clenched tight,
with tongue propped against the upper palate,
drawing **clear qi** (清气) through the nose,
inhale softly and continuously,
until the abdomen is full, then stop.
Then, close it,
so that inside does not emerge, outside does not enter,
counting the breath with my mind,
storing the **spirit** with my intention.
Next, focus on the **Elixir Field** (下丹田).
Within the two kidneys lies a **tripod** (鼎),
and within the tripod is an **infant** (婴儿),
whose name is **Heavenly Sovereign Lord of the Origin** (天皇元君).
Sitting upright, the infant emits a **five-colored light** (五色之光).
Next, focus on my heart like a **red lotus leaf** (红芙叶),
hanging yet unopened,
within it is a **maiden** (妮女),
whose name is the **Earthly Rear Spirit** (地后之神).
Standing on the **five-colored clouds** (五彩之云),
then descend to pull the **Heavenly Sovereign** inward,
uniting with it.
In an instant, **original fire** (元火) descends from above,
**Flowering Pool** (華池) ascends from below—
now is the moment of **water and fire’s completion** (水火既济).
Close the breath and wait until the fire reaches one catty,
then **rinse the mouth** (漱口) with the **Jade Dew** (玉津) twenty to thirty times,
tap the teeth three times,
and evenly divide the three **swallows** (三咽),
to correspond with the **Three Yin** (三阴).
Left opens the **Golden Pass** (金关),
right passes through the **Jade Palace** (玉宫),
entering the tripod, then stopping.
Then, slowly exhale the **turbulent qi** (浊气),
and softly release the breath,
its name is **Rain Descending** (雨降),
also called **Dragon Leads the Way, Tiger Follows** (龙先行、虎后至).

As before, first **fire three** (行火三),
then **water three** (行水三),
until the time of **Chou** (丑),
when the right nostril is refreshed.
Then, first **water three** (行水三),
then **fire three** (行火三),
opening the **Jade Gate** (玉户) on the right.

At **Wu**’s moment, I gather the **Moon’s spirit** (月中之神),
its name is **Lesser Yin** (少阴).
First, with the right foot raised above,
the method is as before.

**Spirit storage and observation** (存观) is the **Yin-stilling method** (阴定法),
to prevent the **spirit** from wandering outside the **gates** (户).
When the breath is still, the **qi**’s exchange is complete.

One breath’s stillness contains the Six Harmonies within,
thus inhaling and exhaling the Three Yins and Three Yangs,
making them ascend and descend in union—
the Three Sons and Three Daughters combine to refine the essence.

Therefore, the mind stores the **spirit**, the **spirit** unites with the **qi**,
and when the breath is still, the **qi** harmonizes.

Breath is the **Primordial Fire**.
Using **fire** in twenty-four *chǐ* measures,
straightforward as the twenty-four lines of the four *guà*,
corresponding to the twenty-four seasons of the year.

Thus, using **fire** in twenty-four *chǐ* measures:
when the breath is still nine thousand six hundred times,
a single closure of four hundred breaths yields one *chǐ* of **fire**.
Twenty-four closures of breath complete twenty-four *chǐ* of **fire**.

Hence it is said:
*"Accumulating water forms the sea; accumulating **qi** forms the **spirit**."*
This is what is meant.

Then, the daily **Fire Function** of a full celestial circuit
can reclaim the twelve years of **not-death**.

Mortal **qi** and blood traverse eight hundred ten *zhàng* by day and night.
If one can regulate the *cùn* and *liǎng* within a hundred *kè*,
then the **Dao** of observing heaven lies within the palm.

The upper three lines of a *guà* are **Yin**—
one inhalation corresponds to them,
and the **qi** enters three *cùn*.

The **Dagger** (*dāo*) is twenty-four *cùn*;
the **Jade Tablet** (*guī*) is twenty-four *chǐ*;
the **Measure** (*chǐ*) is twenty-four *chǐ*;
the **Two** (*liǎng*) is twenty-four *chǐ*.

The lesser count of one line is one *cùn*;
one breath is six *cùn*.
When stillness is held in one breath, it becomes sixteen movements,
yielding two *chǐ* and four *cùn*—
this is the **Flowing Pearl Elixir**.

The middle count of one line is one *chǐ*;
ten breaths are six *chǐ*.
When stillness is held in forty breaths, it becomes one hundred sixty movements,
yielding twenty-four *chǐ*—one **Jade Tablet**—
this is when **blood** and **qi** cease flowing and gather as the **Crucible**.

Is this not what **Pure Yang Child** called
*"self-administering the Dagger and Jade Tablet"*?

The greatest **Yielding** of one line is one *zhàng*;
one breath is six *zhàng*.
When fully held in four hundred breaths, it becomes one thousand six hundred movements,
yielding twenty-four *zhàng*—one **Measure**—
this is when **blood** and **qi** cease flowing and transform.

By day and night, the **Fire Function** should yield one *liǎng*, nine *chǐ*, seven *dāo*, and half a **Jade Tablet**,
counting its essence as eight hundred ten—
the **earthly number** where **blood** and **qi** do not flow.

From the *Jīn Xuān Bā Sù Piān*:
*"Seal the **spirit’s dwelling**,
and regulate the breath."*

When the **Nine Nines** are complete, the **Spirit** descends to dwell.

Those who refine the **Elixir** must first externally harmonize **Yin-Yang** and internally illuminate the **viscera and bowels**, only then may they proceed.

The **bones and joints** number three hundred sixty, the **hair follicles** eighty-four thousand—none lack their place within.
The **Spinal Column**, the **Heavenly Pillar**, has twenty-four nodes; three hidden **Passes** lie upon the back:
The lowest node is called **Crow’s Tail**, situated in the **Scrotal Cavity’s Heart**—this is the **Gate of the Valley Spirit**, the **Tail Hearing**, **Sea Gate**, and **Loop Pass**.

The middle node is called **Elbow’s Back**, opposite the **Heart’s Extremity**—this is the **Pass of the Nine-Heaven Fire Dragon’s Flying Crow**.

The upper node, behind the neck and shoulder, is called **Great Spine**—this is the **Fighting Bull**, the **Dragging Support**, the three **Paths to the Upper Clarity’s Flying Step**, the **Changing Scales**, and the **Gate of the Returning Path of the Regenerating Tiger, Regenerating Dragon**.

Facing forward, the **Braided Bag** triples, three **Fields** divided within its three **Cùns** of length:
From the **Mud Pellet** to the **Neck** is the **Upper Elixir Field**, named the **Brain Palace**, divided into nine **petals**—the **Sea of Marrow, Brain, and Blood**, the **Gate of the Mysterious Female**.

From the **Neck’s Severance** to the **Stomach’s Severance** is the **Middle Elixir Field**, named the **Vermilion Palace**, divided into nine **orifices**—the **Sea of Saliva and Water**, the **Gate of the Detached Heart**.

From the **Stomach’s Severance** to the **Navel’s Severance** is the **Lower Elixir Field**, named the **Mysterious Palace**, encompassing the **Four Symbols**, arraying the **Nine Officials**—the **Sea of Spirit, Qi, and Essence**, the **Gate of the Balanced End**.

The three **Fields** each have **diaphragmatic membranes**, threefold yet impenetrable to one another.
The **Upper Primordial Palace** illuminates the **Ten Thousand Phenomena** of **Forest of Forms**.
The **Middle Primordial Palace** houses the **Pure Yang** of the **Five Viscera**.
The **Lower Primordial Palace** transmits the **Filth and Turbidity** of the **Six Bowels**.

The **Six Bowels** lie before, the **Five Viscera** reside behind, their **pulse-orifices** interconnected yet each with its own **passages and unions**.

The **Heart** is the **Li** hexagram—its **Spirit** governs, its **orifice** is the **tongue**, its **union** is the **Small Intestine**; it generates **blood, vessels, sweat, pores, hair**, and its **sound** is **speech**.

The **Kidneys** are the **Kǎn** hexagram—its **Essence** governs, its **orifice** is the **ear**, its **union** is the **Bladder**; it generates **bone, fat, sac, saliva, teeth**, and its **sound** is **groaning**.

The **Lungs** are the **Duì** hexagram—its **Po** governs, its **orifice** is the **nose**, its **union** is the **Large Intestine**; it generates **qi, skin, mucus, hair**, and its **sound** is **weeping**.

The **Liver** is the **Zhèn** hexagram—its **Hun** governs, its **orifice** is the **eye**, its **union** is the **Gallbladder**; it generates **sinew, membranes, tears, nails**, and its **sound** is **shouting**.

The **Spleen** is the **Kūn** hexagram—its **Will** governs, its **orifice** is the **mouth**, its **union** is the **Stomach**; it generates **flesh, brain, marrow, saliva**, and its **sound** is **singing**.

The **tongue** is the **root of the Heart**; the **penis** is the **stalk of the Kidneys**—
all these stem from the **Primordial One Qi**, embracing **Yin** and **Yang**, harmonizing the **Five Phases**, and giving rise to the **Six-Feet Frame**.

From **one year** to **sixteen**, the **True One** is pure and complete, filling to the measure of **one jin**. Once grown, it begins to dissipate.

All **food** gathers in the **Stomach**, secretly receiving the **Primordial Fire’s** refining—
the **Pure** ascends like **cloud-rain**, nourishing the **Heavens**,
the **Impure** sinks like **dung-soil**, draining to the **Earth**.

Thus, one should daily use the **Ascending Nourishing Water** to cleanse the **chest and intestines**,
and the **Odd Yang Fire** to consume the **form and substance**.

Now, the **Ascending Nourishing** gathers at the **mouth** as **saliva**,
fills the **Lungs** as **spittle**,
fills the **Heart** as **blood**,
fills the **Kidneys** as **essence**.

**Essence** is the **True Lead** of the **Sea Palace**, uniquely complete in the **Five Phases**—
this is the **Pearl Flow of the Great Yang**.

Its nature is fierce and unyielding, most difficult to subdue.
When the **True Fire of Heaven’s Five** descends from above to conquer it,
it ascends to the **Mud Pellet**, flowing through the **hundred vessels**,
able to **solidify marrow and brain**, **strengthen bones and flesh**, **master qi and blood**, **nourish hair**, **refine sinews and intestines**—
thus it **dwells among the Ten Thousand Spirits** and **reaches the Three Palaces**.

At the **four junctures** of **day and night**—**walking, standing, sitting, lying**—
should **demons** suddenly arise,
enter the **Chamber**, cross-legged and seated,
close the **eyes**, shut the **mouth**, grasp firmly,
clear the **mind**, and internally visualize the **two Kidney Vessels** merging at the **Spinal Column**,
like a **thread**, ascending along the **Heavenly Pillar**,
piercing straight to the **Mud Pellet**.
Once established, regulate the **qi**:
first, from the **Scrotal Sac’s hole**, between the **Kidneys’ two origins**, draw in one **contraction**,
inhale as you withdraw, guiding the **One Qi** to the **Brain**.
Then close the **mouth and nose**, preventing **qi** from rushing out.
From the **Scrotal Sac’s hole**, inhale as you withdraw again, but **slowly**.

Why **ascend and descend**?
To **internally rotate the Mysterious Tortoise**, drawing the **Neck Pass**,
secretly counting to **eighty-one**.

One **rotation** is three counts—
the key is to **tightly seal the nasal gate**,
so that within **one inhalation**, the **Tortoise Pass** turns **eighty-one times**.

If the **breath surges** or the **qi rushes**, clashing at the **nose**, regulate it **softly and continuously**,
until it reaches the **hundred passes**.
Then, as soon as an inhalation begins, the **breath** stabilizes,
and the **rotation** completes **eighty-one times**—
**slow, continuous, and natural**, without strain.

Only then does one hear the **two Kidneys** **unblocked**, the **hundred passes** **unhindered**,
the **Heart** **joyful**, the **Spirit** **delighted**, the **bones light**, the **qi clear**,
as if seated in **warm bathwater**.

At first, the **qi** is untamed, the **fire’s timing** unripe—
sealing the **mouth and nose** is difficult.
Yet fear not.
When the **qi surges upward** from **Nine to Nine**, proceed **gradually**.

In **rotating the breath**, sometimes **one Nine**, sometimes **two Nines**, sometimes **three Nines**—
if the **surge** is difficult to regulate, **pause** and **slowly** adjust the **qi**,
guiding it into the **Elixir Field**.
When the **mind** is **serene and steady**, the **mouth** may **slightly open**,
but the **nose must not be carelessly released**—
this is the **Commanding of the Breath**.

The practice endured, and when harmony settled, the **saliva and fluids** steamed and flowed—do not hastily wipe your clothes.

This **Commanding of the Breath**, when mastered, reaches **four Nines**, **six Nines**, and finally **nine Nines** in full measure. Adjusting the **qi** and steadying the **mind**, fill the mouth with saliva, then send the **fire** leftward to swallow nine times, directing it inward to the **Sea Within**. Thus, all malevolent influences retreat.

This is the **Lesser Inner Elixir**.

Without encountering the **Great Work of Heaven and Earth**, merely practicing this **Way** in daily life, after a **memorial cycle (12 years)**, one may renew **bone and blood**, restore youthful complexion and blacken the hair, becoming firm and unyielding without leakage.

Within the **Wind and Thunder Gates**, in a sealed chamber, seated cross-legged in **Kan (☴) and Xun (☴)**, straighten the spine and grasp firmly. Close the eyes, quiet the **mind**, gather the **spirit** with intent, and stir the **Dragon’s Tail**. Within the **teeth**—inner, outer, left, right, up, down—and at the **root of the tongue**, stir and rinse the **Heavenly Water** as it ascends. When full, contain it. Then, with a steady **mind**, internally observe the **Qi Sea** between the **Two Kidneys**—like a **crimson cloud** enclosing a **scarlet sun**, blazing red light, resembling a **fire-pearl**, as large as a **yellow tangerine**. Focus the **mind** upon the **fire-pearl**, drawing out a thread of **fire** as thick as a **rope**, circulating it to **Dui (☰)**—this is the **Golden Pass**.

Upon reaching **Dui**, the **fire and metal** interact, producing a strange sound. Gently direct the **mind** toward the body, rubbing the hands over it as the **fire** passes **Dui**, moving through **Li (☲)** into **Zhen (☳)**. Then, divide the **Heavenly Water** from the mouth, swallowing it straight down to **Dui**, where it merges with the **fire**, returning to the **Elixir Field**—this completes **one swallow**.

If the **swallowing** feels incomplete, exhale slightly upward, inhaling a breath of **fire** to drive it leftward and downward until it descends fully. If the **drawing and swallowing** are unclear, the **descending qi** will not be complete, risking **stagnant yin** and accumulated **pathologies**, harming the **Six Palaces**.

Thus, **one fire and one water** constitute **one swallow**. Follow this method diligently, practicing **sixty times for Wind**, **sixty times for Thunder**, daily without ceasing. When the **spirit’s count** is complete, success will come within a year.

By the **tenth swallow**, gather the **mind** as if drawing **fire**, blending **water and fire** from the **Sea’s center**, circulating through **Kan, Dui, Li, Xun, Zhen** in **nine revolutions**. When the **tide** rises, moisten and guide it downward.

At the onset, the **mind** may tremble—this is the **yin evils** burning in resistance. Remain steady and unmoved. By **seventy days**, this marks the **Middle Transformation**; beyond **one hundred days**, the **Lesser Signs** appear.

At **twenty days** and **thirty days**, though the **qi-field** is clear, there may be **cold or heat**; the **Six Palaces** stir. By **seventy days**, the **water source** overflows, as if descending with pain, and **urination** becomes frequent. Though the **Three Fields** are open, the **Six Emotions** still fluctuate—once, a **minor battle** occurs, with the **tide surging like waves**, the **fire erupting like thunder**.

Thus, the **Five Viscera** become unobstructed, the **Nine Cauldrons** secretly connected, and **appetite doubles**. By **one hundred fifty days**, the **parasitic hunger** recedes. By **one hundred eighty days**, the **creatures** emerge—**inch-worms, barley-worms, millet-worms, purple silkworms**—some like **parrot droppings**, others like **gallbladder bile**. By **two hundred days**, the **True Qi** penetrates the **Five Viscera**: entering the **lungs**, all **poisons retreat**; entering the **liver, heart, spleen, kidneys**, the **Five Colors** fade, and **filth descends with hidden pain**.

By **two hundred fifty days**, the **clean viscera and turbid bowels** grow cold. Then, a **wheel of fire** appears, revolving within—**Five Internals** purified, the **alcohol support** circulating, and **one hundred vessels** lightened. The **ears** become keen, the **eyes** bright, the **marrow** plentiful, the **bones** solid, the **flesh** refined, the **sinews** strong, the **qi** complete, the **blood** unobstructed. Below the **navel**, above the **Qi Sea**, the **internal essence** rises in layers, fat as **silkworms in cocoons**; one revolution, and the **qi** may move freely.

The **Original Qi** naturally resides in the **Elixir Field**, forming **fire**, converging at the **Central Palace**, heavy as if two fists—**hidden and warm**. Below the **navel**, it constantly glows; when the **stomach is empty**, the **fire-wheel** ascends, circulating the **Eight Trigrams**, like the sound of a **thunder-chariot**. The **Heavenly Water** and **Jade Fluids** flow; when **thoughts arise**, the mouth fills. The **Original Fire** and **Spirit Pearl** traverse the **Three Palaces**, and thus the **Eight Evils** retreat.

Who knows the **Inner Elixir’s method**? Its **secret** is thus:

*"Steady the **Heavenly Heart**, purify **Wuji (戊己)**, gather at **Weishen (巳亥)**, take at **Yinshen (寅申)**.
Circulate the **Milky Way**, revolve in the **Golden Cauldron**.
First, like a **woman grinding in emptiness**, then undress and quiet the **mind**.
Fold the legs and lie supine, rub the palms until warm, then apply the **method**—wash and wipe the face.
Thus, the body becomes unobstructed. Briefly steady the **breath**, close the eyes, seal the **passes**, and begin **inner observation**.
A **jade wave** emerges, filling heaven and earth, and the **Five Spirits** naturally submerge while **ten thousand thoughts** cease.

Within the body, the **Taiji** transforms into a **Palace**—
the **Left Golden Hall**, where my **embryonic form** resides;
the **Right Jade Chamber**, where my **ancestral mother** dwells.
Secretly emerging and merging, the **Two Qis** blend and flow—
then **lead and mercury** congeal in the **Golden Cauldron**.

Quickly ignite the **Earth Fire**, leftward in **three layers**, empty and contracting—
each enters the **sac-like cavities**. Inhale and exhale, drawing the **breath** through the **major joints**, past the **elbow’s pass**, dwelling **twenty-six counts**. Pause when breathless.

**Second:** Lower the **pillow**, flip the hands left and right, hook the **face’s center**, then from below the **sac-like cavities**, rotate in **three layers**, contracting and drawing the **breath**, past the **Fighting Bull’s pass**, dwelling **twenty-six counts**. Pause when breathless.

**Third:** Rise and sit, reverse the **Phoenix Wings**, stretch the **Great Bull’s Chariot**, then from below the **sac-like cavities**, rotate in **three layers**, contracting and drawing the **breath**, ascending to the **Brain Palace**. Bow the head **three times**, each **twenty-six counts**. Pause when breathless."

This **threefold return**—once the **passes and locks** grow sluggish, with **fire’s Dao** and **water’s source** both sluggish and delayed, and **circulation** still coarse—one must not rigidly adhere to each original method, for forcing the **great counts** risks harm. Instead, proceed gradually by **virtue/power**:

- **Ten counts**, or **twenty**, or **fifty**, until the proper number is reached.
When **fire surges** and **water flows**, and the **functions** are unobstructed, then calculate the **days** and proceed accordingly. By the end of a year, the work is complete.

**Flying water** is easy to rinse; **primordial fire** is difficult to draw.

The **heart of the sea’s primordial fire** has **qi** but no substance. Only by **fixing the mind** within the **dim haze**, directing the **intent** to draw it, will the **spirit** resonate with the **Dao’s symbols**, and the fire within the **pearl** naturally emerge with the will. It follows the **Eight Trigrams**, blazing fiercely to scorch the **navel**, striking the **Jue Pass** to emit sound.

At first, the drawn fire is but the size of **one finger’s pulse**. Over time, it traverses the **Eight Trigrams**, and within **thirty days**, it pierces the **Jue Pass**, producing a **crow’s cry**. By **sixty days**, it sounds like a **dove’s coo**; by **ninety days**, like a **boiling cauldron**; by **one hundred days**, like **tides**; by **half a year**, like **thunder**. Thus, the **fetal qi** condenses into **true fire**.

In the first **thirty days**, the fire is weak and the water sluggish; the **passes and locks** are not yet open, and the **dim haze** resists action. Poisonous insects, corpse ghosts, and the **Eight Evils**, **Yin specters** burned by the fire, become **demons**, causing **anger, greed, and lust**—only ensure the fire does not extinguish. After completing the **threefold return**, rest briefly, then sit **serene and composed**, the mind at ease. Rinse fully with **flying water**, swallowing the fire **nine times** from left to right, until it reaches the **Elixir Field**—this is the **Great Return**, refining the **golden essence** once.

When the **circuit of stars** is complete and the work is fulfilled, then seek the **Spiritual Mountains’ finest lands**, choosing the **hour of the Pig** on a **Hai month/day**. Undress and lie down, bathe lightly, and await full relaxation. Close the eyes, secure the **passes**, and focus on the **true female’s palace**. When the **essence** fills **one jin**, and the **male and female** align at **twenty-eight**, their **emotions merge**, bodies warm and unified, husband and wife in perfect harmony—by the **hour of the Tiger**, the **sacred embryo** is firmly formed within.

From the **hour of the Rat onward**, lock the **golden pass**, sit **upright and still**, neither turning nor shaking. By the **hour of the Tiger**, release the hands and stretch the feet, letting the mind wander freely. Sit hidden behind a screen, walking **ten steps** at first—never exceeding **twenty-four**—until **one hundred steps**, then after a month, move as desired. At the **great union**, within a single moment, the **circuit of stars** is already complete.

Thus, the **three thousand six hundred measures of true qi** are perfected, the **seven hundred twenty constellations** gathered, extending to **one breath of the Two Commands**, the **Three Talents and Four Symbols**, the **Five Phases and Six Harmonies**, the **Seven Stars and Eight Trigrams**, the **Nine Palaces and Ten Stems**, the **Twelve Branches**, the **Twenty-Four Seasons**, and the **Seventy-Two Weather Divisions**—all contained within **one embryo**.

Having obtained the **true qi of the *Great Change***—**three hundred eighty-four measures**—to form the **spiritual embryo**, the **top’s aperture** gradually opens, splitting on its own. With each **rise and pause**, each **embrace and support**, the **intent** must be precise, with **no impure thought**, and only then may it proceed.

By the **tenth month**, the **spirit** longs to **ascend and shed the body**, and the **mind grows restless**. The **aperture** splits like **thunder’s strike**, the **crown** cracking as if **flames** rose twenty-four **nodes** from the **celestial pillar**, bursting from the **top**. The practitioner must **calm the mind and steady the intent**, walking **ten steps** beyond **one zhang**. After **two years**, the **spiritual powers** are complete, the **numinous awareness** boundless—near or far, penetrating **profound mysteries and hidden depths**, unobstructed in all things.

When the **virtue/power** is profound and the **virtue/power** vast, the **shell is shed**, and one ascends to **pay homage to the Jade Emperor**.

**The Golden and Azure Dragon Chapter: On Nurturing Life in the Great Clarity**

The four seasons shift endlessly, like a cycle without beginning or end;
The tiger lies dormant, the dragon coils—transformed into the Golden Elixir.

**Master Liu** said: Gazing upward at the celestial symbols,
One comes to know the four seasons constantly moving,
Yin and Yang alternating, to calculate the slow and swift passage of sun and moon,
Their waxing and waning, thus uncovering the **Dao** of life’s formation,
And recording it in the *Golden and Azure Dragon* scripture.

**Golden** refers to the harmonized balance of firmness and softness;
**Azure** refers to the **Daoist adept** wandering in the **Azure Realm**.

The **Sun** is the essence of the Great Yang, the **soul** of Heaven;
Its nature is fierce and unyielding, capable of generating all things,
Residing within Yin—this is the **Li** hexagram.

The **Moon** is the essence of the Great Yin, the **spirit** of Earth;
Its nature is tranquil yet prone to agitation,
Residing within Yang—this is the **Kan** hexagram.

**Kan** represents the time of two Yins,
Where the **Sun** is born from a single Yang—this is **black lead**,
Emerging from **mercury**,
As it reaches the **Gen** palace, it gradually manifests as **greenish-white**, becoming the **Lesser Youth**,
This is the birth of one Yang from two Yins.

Then, **forty-five days** from its initial position,
Yang arises from below—this is the **Zhen** hexagram.
Its name is the **soul of cinnabar**,
And thus its **mercury** gradually subdues.

By **Peri**, six Yangs are complete,
Its name is **red gold**.
**Forty-five days** from the **Southern Vermilion** (Jiu) land,
Refined by **martial fire**,
**Forty-five days** until it reaches the **Kun** palace,
Where **yellow and black** blend—its essence is called **returning elixir**.
**Forty-five days** until it reaches the **Dui** palace,
Where the **mercury**’s body grows dry,
Its decay like mud—its name is **concealed fire**.

**Mercury** is short-lived, its fire able to enter the **Great Yang**,
Reaching the **Qian** palace—**thirty-six cycles**,
Its **gold** now **true purple**,
Reentering the **Central Palace**,
Where **Great Regeneration** merges with **Wu Fire**,
And **Yellow Chief** unites with **Wu Soil**—

**Realgar** is applied in covering,
Called the **#1**—only **White Tiger** controls it,
After **sixty cycles**, its name is **Gouzi**.
**Five cycles** later, its name is **White Gold Gouzi**.
**Six cycles** later, its name is **Five Metals Divine Elixir**.
**Five cycles** later, its name is **Great One Divine Powder**.

The highest stage is called **Water Mother**;
If it does not ascend and instead spirals within, it is called **Chen#2 Sand**;
If **purple and black** permeate fully, it is called **Great Returning Elixir**;
If it is **red and luminous**, it is called the **Elixir of Purple Micro**.

With **fasting and abstinence** for **one hundred days**,
Selecting the **royal qi** to swallow three **pellets**,
Then the **Three Corpses**, **Nine Vermin**, and **Seven Toxins** are all eliminated.
Taking it for **eighteen cycles**,
One can **ascend and soar through the heavens**.

**The Nine Transformations of the Golden Elixir Chapter**

When a person attains **Oneness**, this is **Original Fire**;
Refined in the **Three Fields**, with **spiritual qi** as auxiliary.

**Kanglongzi**, the **Daoist adept** from **Western Shu** at **Qingcheng Mountain** (段昊也),
Said: **The Dao** generates **Oneness**—this is the **One Qi of the Great Void**.
All things and humans,
Their birth stems from **One Qi**, their death returns to **One Qi**.

**Yin** is **nature**—that which comes from **nothingness**;
**Yang** is **life-force**—that which arises from **somethingness**.

The **body** is the **form**, the **heart** its function;
The **heart** is the **form**, the **spirit** its function;
The **spirit** is the **form**, the **qi** its function.

**Qi**’s form is governed by **movement**, refined in the **saliva furnace** as its function.

The **divine spirits** of Heaven and Earth are born from **Yin and Yang**;
The **divine essences** of **qi** are transformed from **Yin and Yang**.

Why are there some whose **spirit** is dimmed and **nature** obscured?
Because their **qi** does not align with their **spirit**, nor their **spirit** with their **qi**.

Thus, the **heart** takes **nature** as its **spirit**,
And the **spirit** takes the **heart** as its function.
The **spirit** is the **true essence** of **nature**;
**Nature** is the **form** of the **spirit**.

Therefore, **preserving the spirit** and **nurturing the qi**,
**Penetrating nature** and **clearing the spirit**,
Always letting the **spirit** assist the **qi** and the **qi** assist the **spirit**,
Naturally leads to **longevity**.

What is it for Heaven and Earth to attain **Oneness**?
**Yin and Yang** are the answer.

What is it for humans to attain **Oneness**?
**Original Fire** is the answer.

To know **Oneness**,
Then **emptiness** is the **medicine**,
The **Elixir’s Root** the **furnace**,
**True Qi** the **fire**,
Refined in the **Three Fields**—
If **true qi** does not disperse,
Can **Yin and Yang** truly lament their **forms**?

The **mysterious applications** of the **Dao** are threefold:
The highest—**circulating the Original Qi of the Great Void**,
**Pairing with Kan and Li spirits**,
Entering the **manifest world**, its **form** naturally transforms,
**Overcoming the unmanifest**, its **form** naturally attains **truth**;

The middle—**preserving the form and securing the qi**,
**Nurturing the form**, **dwelling in the true**,
**Spiritual qi** harmonized and refined,
**Penetrating and naturally luminous**;

The lowest—**discarding turbidity and retaining purity**,
**Spirit and soul** not dispersing, their **essence** preserved.

As for **governing the void**, **guiding the Great Space**,
And **examining its beginning and end**, the **Eight Trigrams** are the key.

**One line** is **One Qi**;
**Fourteen lines** are the **Fourteen Qi**—

The **movement** of Heaven and Earth begins,
With **wind wheels** above—symbols of **Unfinished**,
The **Three Yin Qi** descending from the **Void Emperor’s** essence;
With **water wheels** below—symbols of **Finished**,
The **Three Yang Qi** descending from the **Void Emperor’s** essence.

**East** is **Zhen**—the **True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns**, the **Lesser Yang Wood**,
Born from water, corresponding to the **liver**.
The **liver** takes **Jia** as elder brother, **Yi** as younger sister,
**Ji** as the **wife of Jia**, and **Geng** as the **husband of Yi**—
This is the **True Qi of the Great Yang Wood**, becoming **Xun**,
Born from wind.

**South** is **Li**—the **True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Fire**,
Born from wind, corresponding to the **heart**.
The **heart** takes **Bing** as elder brother, **Ding** as younger sister,
**Xin** as the **wife of Bing**, and **Ren** as the **husband of Ding**—
This is the **True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Three Yin Earth**,
Born from wind, becoming **Kun**.
Its upper is black, its lower red,
Its left white, its right green,
Its center yellow,
And it **conceals within One Qi**—its hue is **mysterious**.

**West** is **Dui**—the **True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Lesser Yin Metal**,
Born from wind, corresponding to the **lung**.
The **lung** takes **Geng** as elder brother, **Xin** as younger sister,
**Yi** as the **wife of Geng**, and **Bing** as the **husband of Xin**—
This is the **True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Great Yang Metal**,
Born from water, becoming **Qian**.

**North** is **Kan**—the **True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Yangming Water**,
Born from water, corresponding to the **kidney**.
The **kidney** takes **Ren** as elder brother—**ten days**—
**Twenty-four divinations**, this is the **second**, **Gui** as younger sister,
**Ding** as the **wife of Ren**, **Wu** as the **husband of Gui**—
This is the **True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Three Yang Earth**,
Born from water, becoming **Gen**.
Its upper is red, its lower black,
Its left green, its right white,
Its center yellow,
And it **conceals within One Qi**—its hue is **crimson**.
---

The **Center** is **Kun**—corresponding to the **spleen**.
The **spleen** takes **Wu** as elder brother, **Ji** as younger sister,
**Gui** as the **wife of Wu**, and **Jia** as the **husband of Ji**.

The **Three Yang** disperses in water to become **Heaven**—this is **Qian**,
Its natural **qi** named **Taihe Jun**;
The **Three Yin** disperses in wind to become **Earth**—this is **Kun**,
Its natural **spirit** named **Taichen Jun**.

**Qian** generates **three sons**: **Zhen**, **Kan**, and **Gen**—
The **essence of the dragon**, the **public of the phoenix**.
**Kun** generates **three daughters**: **Xun**, **Li**, and **Dui**—
The **body of the tiger**, the **essence of the tortoise**.

The **Six Qi**—**Three Yang**, **Three Yin**—
Are **transmitted to the Five Zang**, **ascend and descend through the Six Fu**,
**Enmesh the Three Elements**, **bind the Eight Vessels**,
**Circulate through the Twelve Channels and Fifteen Collaterals**,
**Cycle back through the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Orifices**,
From **Heaven’s Gate** above to **Earth’s Portal** below.
**Gain one breath**, and **heat** arises;
**Lose one breath**, and **cold** arises.

**Yang qi** spirals leftward, **Yin qi** revolves rightward—
**Five thousand degrees** in its **Microcosmic Orbit**.
Thus, when **left qi** converges, **right qi** responds;
When **right qi** converges, **left qi** responds—
And each has its **pairing**.

The **essence of Lesser Yang**, the **orthodox of Great Yang**—
These are the **first and second True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Metal**.
The **essence of Great Yang**, the **orthodox of Lesser Yang**—
These are the **third and fourth True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Fire**.
The **essence of Yangming**, the **orthodox of Lesser Yang**—
These are the **fifth True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Earth**.
The **essence of Lesser Yin**, the **orthodox of Great Yin**—
These are the **sixth True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Wood**.
The **essence of Great Yin**, the **orthodox of Reclusive Yin**—
These are the **seventh True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns Water**.
The **essence of Reclusive Yin**, the **orthodox of Lesser Yin**—
These are the **eighth True Qi of the Nine Sovereigns**.

Thus, the **Central Palace** is set as the **cauldron**,
To **collect and seize the marvelous qi** of the **Eight Directions**,
**Pairing with Earth** and **harmonizing**?
**Refining without dispersion**,
Then the **Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixir** is formed.

Its elixir bears **nine hues**: **cyan**, **red**, **white**, **black**, **yellow**, **purple**, **green**, **azure**, and **rust-brown**—
These are the **Nine Colors**.

In ancient times, **Emperor Huang** refined his **sword** and cast his **cauldron**,
Riding the **Fire Dragon** to ascend to **Heaven**—
This is the **illustration of internal alchemy**.
How so?
The **heart** is **fire**;
The **liver** is **charcoal**;
The **kidneys** are **wheels**;
The **lungs** are **golden liquid**;
The **spleen** is the **furnace altar**.

The **Classics** state:
The **heart** is **cinnabar**,
The **lungs** are **mica**,
The **liver** is **void-blue**,
The **kidneys** are **lodestone**,
The **gallbladder** is **realgar**—
This is the **meaning of pairing and refining**.

Thus, the **Sage** uses the **body as furnace**,
The **Three Palaces as cauldrons**,
Refining the **unending qi**,
Entering the **form of Non-Action**.

**Body still**, **spirit naturally clears**;
**Spirit clear**, **qi naturally abounds**;
**Spirit and qi harmonized**, **form naturally lightens**.
When **One Qi** is settled, **a hundred vessels** are perpetually full;
When the **Nine Cauldrons** are perfused, **ten thousand spirits** are naturally numinous.

The **Nine Cauldrons** are the **functions of the Nine Palaces**.
The **Elixir Field** is the **Caulron of True Unity**—
This is the **Hall of the Nine Cauldrons’ Grand Assembly**.
**Unifying One Qi** to become **True**,
**Refining the Nine Qi** to form **Divine Elixir**.

What are the **Nine Qi**?
They are called **Nine Qi**, **Nine Regions**, **Nine Realms**, **Nine Bends**, **Nine Orifices**, **Nine Palaces**, **Nine Circulations**, **Nine Returns**, and **Nine Cauldrons**.

Within the **Nine Cauldrons**,
There are the **Seven Reversions**, the **Eightfold Four-Eight-Six Transformations**, and the **Nine Returns**’s **Way**.

**Reversion** is **covering and merging**,
To **recover the Qi and Blood** of the **Seven Exterior and Eight Enveloping Channels and Collaterals**.
**One Reversion (of the pulse)**, and the **pulse halts its movement**;
**Two Reversions (of the qi)**, and the **qi gathers and congeals**;
**Three Reversions (of the blood)**, and the **blood becomes white milk**;
**Four Reversions (of the essence)**, and the **essence condenses into jade-like pearls**;
**Five Reversions (of the bones)**, and the **bones are like red jade**;
**Six Reversion (of the marrow)**, and the **marrow transforms into mysterious frost**;
**Seven Reversion (of the form)**, and the **form clears, the body becomes marvelous**;
**Eight Reversion (of the spirit)**, and the **spirit transforms without bounds**.

**Return** is **retrieving its origin**,
To **draw the Qi of the Five Phases**,
**Stir the Essence of the Three Centers**,
**Stabilize the Primary Source of One Thing**.

**One Return** to the **kidneys**,
**Two Return** to the **heart**,
**Three Return** to the **liver**,
**Four Return** to the **lungs**,
**Five Return** to the **spleen**,
**Six Return** to the **Elixir Chamber**,
**Seven Return** to the **Qi Gate**,
**Eight Return** to the **Essence Hall**,
**Nine Return** to the **Spirit Room**.

When **Nine Transformations** are complete, **form may be preserved**.
At first, **Qian**—
The **large intestine**, **Heaven**—
Its name is **Palace of Metal’s Foundation**, **Palace of the Soul’s Insignia**, its **number is Six**;
Next, **Kan**—
The **kidneys**, **Water**—
Its name is **Palace of Water’s Orthodoxy**, **Palace of the Elixir’s Foundation**, its **number is One**;
Next, **Gen**—
The **urinary bladder**, **Moon**, **Mountain**—
Its name is **Palace of Earth’s Foundation**, **Palace of the Jade Chamber**, where the **Qi of the Spleen and Stomach** converges—
Its **number is Eight**.

Next, **Zhen**—
The **liver**, **Thunder**—
Its name is **Palace of Wood’s Orthodoxy**, **Palace of the Orchid Terrace**, its **number is Three**;

Next, **Xun**—
The **gallbladder**, **Wind**—
Its name is **Palace of Wood’s Foundation**, **Palace of Heavenly Mist**, its **number is Four**;

Next, **Li**—
The **heart**, **Fire**—
Its name is **Palace of Fire’s Orthodoxy**, **Palace of Vermilion**, its **number is Nine**;

Next, **Kun**—
The **small intestine**, **Earth**—
Where the **Crimson Bird** is concealed in the soil—
Its name is **Palace of Earth’s Foundation**, **Palace of the Vermilion Mound**, where the **Qi of the Spleen and Stomach** converges—
Its **number is Two**;

Next, **Dui**—
The **lung**, **Marsh**—
Its name is **Palace of Metal’s Orthodoxy**, **Palace of the Grand Historian**, its **number is Seven**.

The **Central Palace** is the **Yellow Court**, **Lead and Mercury**—
Though the **cauldron lacks a cauldron**, the **elixir lacks an elixir**, the **Four Symbols and Five Phases** never depart from the body—
To seek them externally is to sever oneself from the **Way**.

For those refining the **Golden Elixir**, when **nine years** are complete, its **qi** naturally overflows, its **spirit** naturally becomes luminous—
**Five-colored clouds** pierce the crown, **ten thousand forms** gather in homage.

**Kan and Li**—
**Water and Fire**—
Water flows, moistening;
Fire ascends, drying;
Clouds follow the **Dragon**,
Winds follow the **Tiger**;
Those rooted in **Heaven** gravitate upward,
Those rooted in **Earth** gravitate downward—
Each follows its kind.

Thus, when the **yin qi** moves upward, it descends below; when the **yang qi** moves downward, it ascends above—
This is the **Golden Elixir**’s rise and fall.

From the **Winter Solstice**, one refines the **yang embryo**, internally congealing in the **Dan Tian**—
This is called **Command**;
From the **Summer Solstice**, one refines the **yin breath**, internally congealing in the **Liang Guan**—
This is called **Nature**.

The **yang qi** originates from the feet and spirals leftward, its ascent forming the **Sun**;
The **yin qi** originates from the crown and spirals rightward, its descent forming the **Moon**.

Refining **pure yang** leads to lightness and ascension as a **Immortal**;
Refining **pure yin** leads to stagnation and stillness as a **Ghost**.

The **heart** is the **Liang Guan**, the palace of **Mysterious Spirit**—
Within it lies the **Leaping Serpent**, also named **Blue-Eyed Hu’er**, **Great Substance Demon King**, or **Jade Maiden True Demon**,
Breathing **true qi**, its dispersion like white light,
Causing **Heaven’s True yin qi** to descend.

The **kidneys** are the **Yuan Guan**, the palace of the **Heir Apparent**—
Within them lies the **White Primordial Tortoise**, also named **Golden Vital Demon Beast** or **Wen Ling Demon King**,
Breathing **true qi**, its dispersion like purple clouds,
Causing **Heaven’s True yang qi** to ascend.

The **upper day** is the **wind-mixing** phase, yet unaccomplished—
Its symbol is **Li**, internally corresponding to the **Liang Guan**,
Where **yin** resides within **yang**, giving rise through interaction to the **Spirit of Earthly Grandmother and Mother of the Soil**.

The **lower day** is the **water-wheeling** phase, already accomplished—
Its symbol is **Kan**, internally corresponding to the **Dan Tian**,
Where **yang** resides within **yin**, giving rise through interaction to the **Spirit of Heavenly Infant and Divine Emperor**.

The **sutra** says:
*"Men dwell in the **Kan chamber**, women in the **Li palace**,
Then open the **wind-mixing** and pair with the **Central Palace**—*
This is its meaning.

The **Liang Guan** contains **five colors**—
Its top is black, its base red,
Its left is white, its right green,
Its center is yellow, concealing **White Snow**—
With time, it births the **Earthly Grandmother**,
Whose child is **Golden Liquid**, returning to the **Dan Tian**,
Where the **Wife** returns to the **Husband’s Palace**—
This is the **three yin spirits**.

The **Dan Tian** contains **five colors**—
Its top is red, its base black,
Its left is green, its right white,
Its center is yellow, concealing **Yellow Sprout**—
Which births the **Heavenly Infant**,
Produced from **Golden Liquid**, returning to the **Liang Guan**,
Where the **Husband** returns to the **Wife’s Palace**—
This is the **two yang spirits**.

The **Yellow Sprout**—
When **fire** is refined, it becomes the **Heavenly Infant**,
Its crown emitting a red glow,
Riding the **Green Dragon** upward through the **Golden Pass**.

The **White Snow**—
When **water** is refined, it becomes the **Earthly Grandmother**,
Its crown emitting a blue glow,
Mounting the **White Tiger** downward into the **Jade Hall**.

Thus, **yang qi** refines into red glow and descends, hidden in the **Dan Tian**—
Called the **Sun**;
**Yin qi** refines into blue glow and ascends to the **Liang Guan**—
Called the **Moon**.

The **Li Palace’s yin fire** moves in obscurity, ascending and descending,
Leftward thrust, rightward received,
Spirits and **qi** intermingling,
Dwelling in the **Dan Tian**, with **inner luminous light** appearing—
Its form resembles a **fire wheel**,
**Qi** congealing at the **Dan Yuan**.

The **Kan Palace’s yang fire** moves in obscurity, descending,
Rightward thrust, leftward received,
**Inner luminous light** shining,
Its form resembling a **water wheel**,
All limbs withdrawing,
**Essence** settling at the **Dan Yuan**,
**Qi** congealing in the **kidneys**.

Thus, those refining **qi** cause the **spirit** to come and go,
Ascending and descending, intermingling—
**Five lights** merge into **Oneness**, forming the **embryo** and **breath**.

When **Kan Palace’s qi** congeals, its **navel** emits **five-colored clouds** in radiance;
When **Li Palace’s breath** dwells, its **brow** emits white light—
This is **yin and yang** attaining their proper places,
Naturally interacting.

Yet, refining the **Golden Elixir** requires division of **left and right**, **water and fire**, **great and small**,
Refining both equally.

To act contrary to the **Yijing’s** dynamic patterns is like drilling ice to seek fire!
The adept in refining must:
Open the **Heavenly Gate** above,
Close the **Earthly Door** below,
Leftward draw the **kidney essence** to restrain the **Heavenly Dragon**,
Rightward draw the **lung fluid** to drive the **Earthly Horse**—
Leftward drawing, rightward leading,
Leftward emitting, rightward receiving,
Ascending and descending,
**Two qi** circulate and converge,
Leftward thrust and rightward received,
Rightward thrust and leftward received—
Without explicit interaction, the **spirit** naturally mingles;
Without explicit reception, the **spirit** naturally connects—
Sudden in arrival, sudden in departure,
Sudden in dispersion, sudden in gathering—
All within the **Yellow Court**,
Its dispersion like **wind**, its gathering like **rain**—
This is the **natural way** of refining **qi**.

Refining **qi**—
When **yang** opposes **yin**, **yin** lacks nothing to complete;
When **yin** opposes **yang**, **yang** lacks nothing to generate—
Thus, **inner qi** does not disperse,
**Outer qi** does not enter,
Intermingling within.

Its **qi** steams through the limbs,
Soaring and undulating—
Once mingled, twice mingled,
Once received, twice received—
Causing the **spirit** to command **qi**,
**Qi** to command the **spirit**,
**Spirit** and **qi** mutually commanding—
Naturally forming the **embryo** and **breath**.

Refining the **embryo** and **breath**—
First, clarify the **heart**, settle the **spirit**, stabilize the **qi**,
Ensure **wholeness**—
Thus, a settled **heart** brings a settled **spirit**,
A settled **spirit** brings a settled **qi**,
A settled **qi** brings a settled **breath**,
A settled **breath** brings **qi** convergence—
Convergence leads to congealing without dispersion—
This is the **embryo** and **breath**.

Hence, the **spirit** intermingles within,
The **qi** is received within—
Body intermingles with **qi**,
**Qi** intermingles with the **spirit**,
**Spirit** connects with the body,
Body returns to **essence**—
Pure and subtle, entering the **Mystery**,
Embracing the **Primordial Root**,
Guarding the **True** and preserving the **form**,
**Heart qi** descending,
**Breath** settled within—
**Spirit** and **qi** converge in the **Three Palaces**,
**Embryo** and **breath** congeal in **birth and transformation**—
Thus one may rest in harmony with **Heaven** and **Earth**.

The **Great Elixir’s** use of **fire** must follow the **Yijing’s** patterns.
The **Yijing’s** sixty-four hexagrams represent the **cyclic movements of the stars**.
Three years yield one **intercalary month**,
With **384 days**—
This is the **number of Heaven and Earth’s** seasonal **qi**, storing and ascending, descending and transforming.
Using the **384 days of the Yijing’s** dynamic patterns as the **fire’s** talisman,
Then each month has **three sets of ten days**,
Each set of ten days has **360 hours**—
The **Sun** moves through **two hexagrams**.

Thus the twelve hexagram lines—
six yin, six yang—
mark the shifts of motion and stillness.
These are the **changing lines** that govern the **fire’s** progression.

Beyond the sixty hexagrams used monthly,
there are four more:
**Qian** and **Kun** as the **furnace and cauldron**,
**Li** and **Kan** as the **lead and mercury**.
These are the **pivot and axis** in operation.

The **True Person of Wei** said:
*"Sixty-four hexagrams spread daily as a carriage,
the Dragon Horse harnessed to it,
the enlightened sovereign guiding it—
is this not what is meant?"*

The twelve lines correspond to the twelve **times** of day,
with each five days marking a **phase**,
each thirty-five days marking a **node**,
yet **Mao** and **You** are excluded.
**Mao** and **You** are when **Metal** and **Wood** clash directly.
Thus, the **River Vehicle** moves only through **two victorious phases**,
awaiting the mingling of **Jin** and **Han**—
this is the **fire of burning demons and bathing in purity**.

Therefore, in daily use, ten **times** are applied,
and in yearly use, ten **months**—excluding **Mao** and **You**—
so the **returned elixir** is forged in ten months,
just as the **master** of a man’s life.

Three sets of ten days form one **cauldron**,
for the **Sun** and **Moon** meet every thirty days.
I seize the **Nine Qi** of **Creation’s** transformation,
gather and refine them,
condensing them into **divine elixir**.

My ten **cauldrons** exclude the **Fu** hexagram on days of use.
The *Yijing* says:
*"Initial Nine: The hidden Dragon—do not use it."*
Why?
Because the **elixir medicine** has not yet undergone transformation.

Thus, the **talismanic fire** truly applied is only in the ninth month.
Is this not the **Nine Cauldrons**?

Nine years—
the **nine-nine** number—
takes the **Sun’s** and **Moon’s** movements,
its **true qi** reaching **eighty-one zhang**.
This is the **elixir** itself.

If we speak of one month’s **changing lines** governing the **fire’s** internal method,
then on the first day, the morning uses **Tun**,
the evening uses **Meng**—the **Sun’s** ascent;
on the second day, the morning uses **Xu**,
the evening uses **Song**;

Fourth day: in the morning, **Xiao Xu** [小畜],
in the evening, **Li** [履];
Fifth day: in the morning, **Tai** [泰],
in the evening, **Pi** [否].
This is the **upper five-day phase** of the sixty *qi* cycles.

Fourteenth day: in the morning, **Cheng** [成],
in the evening, **Chang** [常#3].
Fifteenth day: in the morning, **Guang** [逛],
in the evening, **Da Zhuang** [大壮].
This is the **lower five-day phase** of the sixty *qi* cycles.

Sixteenth day: in the morning, **Jin** [晋],
in the evening, **Ming Yi** [明夷]—the **Sun’s descent**;
Seventeenth day: in the morning, **Jia Ren** [家人],
in the evening, **Kui** [睽];
Eighteenth day: in the morning, **Sai** [赛],
in the evening, **Jie** [解];
Nineteenth day: in the morning, **Sun** [损],
in the evening, **Yi** [益];
Twentieth day: in the morning, **Fu** [夫],
in the evening, **Shen** [娠].
This is the **upper five-day phase** of the sixty *qi* cycles.

Twenty-first day: in the morning, **Cui** [萃],
in the evening, **Sheng** [升];
Twenty-second day: in the morning, **Kun** [困],
in the evening, **Jing** [井];
Twenty-third day: in the morning, **Ge** [革],
in the evening, **Ding** [鼎]—the **descending waxing** period;
Twenty-fourth day: in the morning, **Zhen** [震],
in the evening, **Gen** [艮];
Twenty-fifth day: in the morning, **Jian** [渐],
in the evening, **Gui Mei** [归妹].
This is the **middle five-day phase** of the sixty *qi* cycles.

Twenty-sixth day: in the morning, **Feng** [丰],
in the evening, **Lv** [旅];
Twenty-seventh day: in the morning, **Sun** [巽],
in the evening, **Dui** [兑];
Twenty-eighth day: in the morning, **Huan** [涣],
in the evening, **Jie** [节];
Twenty-ninth day: in the morning, **Zhong Fu** [中孚],
in the evening, **Xiao Guo** [小过];
Thirtieth day: in the morning, **Ji Ji** [既济],
in the evening, **Wei Ji** [未济].
This is the **lower five-day phase** of the sixty *qi* cycles.

「The human body embodies the combined **symbols** of Heaven and Earth. From the **Zhāng Guān** [绛官] above to the **Dān Yuán** [丹元] below, on either side of the spinal column, there are fifteen **facial orifices** [穴] at seven *fen* [分] intervals. These are the pathways where the **Five Zang** [五脏] and **Six Fu** [六腑], the **Eight Vessels** [八脉] and **Three Elements** [三元], the myriad **divine spirits** [神], and the **Original Qi** [元气] converge, serving as the **Dao/Way** of ascent and descent.

From the **Zhāng Guān** [绛宫], moving leftward to the fifteen **facial orifices**, this is where the **Qi** ascends and surges. From the **Zhāng Guān** [绛宫], moving rightward to the fifteen **facial orifices**, this is where the **Qi** of the month descends.

The **Qi** and **divine spirits** [神] divide into left and right, ascending and descending with the sun and moon. The **Yang** days ascend from the left, reaching the sixteenth day to descend from the right, thus completing the month. The **Yin** days ascend from the right, reaching the sixteenth day to descend from the left, thus filling the month.

This is what is meant by **"Thirty spokes converge at one hub, yet the void gives rise to the chariot"**—its purpose lies in the interplay of absence and presence.

At the **Winter Solstice** [冬至], when it meets **Jiǎ Zǐ** [甲子], the **Lesser Yang** [少阳] **Qi** begins its function. At the time of **Zǐ** [子], the **Lesser Yang** corresponds to **Kǎn** [坎], its **divine spirit** [神] is the **Potent Dragon** [潜龙], and its **Qi** is the **Heavenly True** [天真] **Qi** of the **Nine Sovereigns** [九皇], the **True Gold** [金真] **Qi**. The **Wood** **Qi** moves through the **Heavenly Mist** [天雾], intersecting with the **Gold Cycle** [金运] at **25 degrees** [度]. It reaches the **Liver’s Orchid Terrace** [肝之兰台], transmitting this **Qi** to the **right Kidney** [右肾], corresponding to the first *kè* [刻] of **Zǐ** [子]. Its transmission spans **32 kè**, reaching the time of **Mǎo** [卯] for **Bathing and Refining** [沐浴运炼]. In five days—one *candidate* [候]—the **Qi** is fully refined after **15 days** [十有五日]. Here, **lead** [铅] generates a portion, manifesting as **dew-like essence** [露蕊], born in the **Dan Tian** [丹田].

It can be taken and refined, with **15 days** [十有五日] constituting one **elixir furnace** [鼎]. The first **15 days** [十有五日] are for **Yang Advancing Fire** [阳进火].

When refining the **Qi** of **Lesser Yang** [少阳], the **upper five days** [上之五日], **middle five days** [中之五日], and **lower five days** [下之五日] each form one *candidate* [候], totaling **60 hours** [时]. The first **2.5 days** [二日半] of the **upper candidate** [上之一候] are **30 hours**, using **fire of 1 liǎng 22 qián** [火一两二十有二铢]; the remaining **2.5 days** add **fire of 1 liǎng** [一两]. The first **2.5 days** of the **middle candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng** [二两], and the remaining **2.5 days** add **fire of 2 liǎng 22 qián** [二两二十有二铢]. The first **2.5 days** of the **lower candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng 22 qián**, and the remaining **2.5 days** add **fire of 3 liǎng** [三两]. Thus, the **Qi** is fully refined.

**15 days** [十五日], **180 hours** [一百八十时]. After the **Winter Solstice**, from the **16th day** [十有六日] until the end of the month, the **Greater Yang** [阳明] corresponds to **Gèn** [艮], its **divine spirit** is the **Manifest Dragon** [见龙], and its **Qi** is again the **Heavenly True** [天真] **Qi** of the **Nine Sovereigns** [九皇], the **True Gold** [金真] **Qi**. The **Wood** **Qi** moves through the **Heavenly Mist** [天雾], intersecting with the **Gold Cycle** [金运] at **25 degrees** [度], while the **human Qi** [人气] also moves **25 degrees**. It transmits this **Qi** to the **right Kidney** [右肾], corresponding to the first *kè* of **Chǒu** [丑]. Over **32 kè**, the **Liver’s Orchid Terrace** [肝之兰台] begins its cycle at **Chén** [辰], completing **three to nine rounds** [遍], arising from the **Opening Origin Palace** [开元之府] to the **left flank of the waist** [腰左胁]. Refining this **Qi** for **15 days**, **lead** [铅] again generates a portion, manifesting as **lotus-like essence** [含莲], nurtured daily by **fire**. Thus, the latter **15 days** are for **Yin Retreating Fire** [阴退火].

Refining the **Qi** of **Greater Yang** [阳明]:
The **upper five days** [上之五日], **middle five days**, and **lower five days**, each form one *candidate* [候], totaling **60 hours**. The first **2.5 days** of the **upper candidate** are **30 hours**, using **fire of 3 liǎng** [三两]; the remaining **2.5 days** reduce **fire to 2 liǎng 22 qián** [二两二十有二铢]. The first **2.5 days** of the **middle candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng 22 qián**, reducing it to **2 liǎng** [二两] in the remaining **2.5 days**. The first **2.5 days** of the **lower candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng**, reducing it to **1 liǎng 22 qián** [一两二十有二铢] in the remaining **2.5 days**.

The first **15 days** are called **Hard Fire** [刚火], whose effects allow one to **see the five colors at night** [夜视五色]. The latter **15 days** are called **Soft Fire** [柔符], whose effects make the **sun radiate divine light** [日射神光].

Then the **elixir furnace** is changed again, with **fire** adjusted from **three days after the Winter Solstice** [冬至三日] to **forty-five days** [四旬有五日]. The **Major Yang** [太阳] corresponds to **Líng** [零], its **divine spirit** is the **Soaring Dragon** [亢龙], and its **Qi** is again the **Heavenly True** [天真] **Qi** of the **Nine Sovereigns** [九皇], the **True Gold** [金真] **Qi**. The **Major Yang** **Qi** moves through the **Heavenly Rain** [天霖], intersecting with the **Gold Cycle** [金运] at **25 degrees** [度], corresponding to the first *kè* of **Yín** [寅]. Its transmission spans **32 kè**, reaching the **Liver’s Orchid Terrace** [肝之兰台] and transmitting this **Qi** to the **left Kidney** [差肾]. Here, **lead** [铅] again generates a portion, manifesting as **embracing an egg-like essence** [抱卵], marking the **changing of the elixir furnace** [换鼎].

The first **15 days** are for **Yang**, advancing **fire** to refine the **Qi** of **Major Yang**. The **upper five days**, **middle five days**, and **lower five days** each form one *candidate*, totaling **60 hours**. The first **2.5 days** of the **upper candidate** are **30 hours**, using **fire of 1 liǎng 22 qián**; the remaining **2.5 days** add **fire of 2 liǎng**. The first **2.5 days** of the **middle candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng**, adding **fire of 2 liǎng 22 qián** in the remaining **2.5 days**. The first **2.5 days** of the **lower candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng 22 qián**, adding **fire of 3 liǎng** in the remaining **2.5 days**. Thus, the **three Qi cycles** refine over **45 days**, constituting **one and a half elixir furnaces** [一鼎半], completing one **section** [节].

Refining reaches this stage, and the **three Yin** [三阴] are exhausted. The **Major Yang** **Qi** enters the **Hùe** [户], gathering at the **ancestral temple** [宗庙], where the remaining **Qi** disperses as **cinnabar** [丹砂]. The latter **15 days** are for **Yin Retreating Fire**, beginning with the **Established Spring Hexagram** [立春卦] at **Gèn** [艮].

The **upper five days**, **middle five days**, and **lower five days** each form one *candidate*, totaling **60 hours**. The first **2.5 days** of the **upper candidate** are **30 hours**, using **fire of 3 liǎng**; the remaining **2.5 days** reduce **fire to 2 liǎng 22 qián**. The first **2.5 days** of the **middle candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng 22 qián**, reducing it to **2 liǎng** in the remaining **2.5 days**. The first **2.5 days** of the **lower candidate** use **fire of 2 liǎng**, reducing it to **1 liǎng 22 qián** in the remaining **2.5 days**.」

The **lower candidate**’s first **2.5 days** use **fire of 2 liǎng**, and the remaining **2.5 days** reduce it to **1 liǎng 22 qián**. Thus, **60 days** complete the **second furnace’s** fire regimen. From this point onward, all fire usage follows this pattern.

Nurturing proceeds until the **Summer Solstice**, when fire is increased while the furnace remains unchanged. Hence, from **Winter Solstice**, fire advances progressively until the **sixth month**, forming the **Yang embryo**—a single **qi** undispersed, congealing at the **Dan Tian**, its hue **red**, known as **Red Lead**, the **Yang Mercury**.

At the **Summer Solstice**, fire is again ignited as at **Winter Solstice**. **Five days** form a *candidate*, **15 days** a *phase*, **one month** a *furnace*, and **45 days** a *node*—all following this principle. Thus, from the **Summer Solstice**, at the **midday hour**, one moment into **Lesser Yin**, the process begins, corresponding to **Lǐ** [离], its spirit the **Hidden Dragon**, its **qi** the **Nine Sovereigns of Heavenly Purity**—the **Three True Qi of Wood**.

Gold circulates through the **Soul Symbol**, intersecting with **Fire** at **25 degrees** of its course. The **Liver’s Chancellery** transmits **qi** to the **Heart’s Palace of Lǐ**, where **mercury** generates **one part**, resembling **dew medicine**, forming in the **Vermilion Palace**. When refined, blood transforms into **white milk**, the skin radiates luster, and further refinement proceeds as before—following the **Winter Solstice’s** fire regimen.

By **Winter Solstice**, fire increases to **five furnaces**, yet water does not—**Yin qi** remains undispersed, congealing in the **Vermilion Palace**. Thus, from **Summer Solstice**, fire advances until the **sixth month**, completing **Yin’s repose**, its hue **black**, known as **Black Lead**, the **Yin Mercury**.

One **red** is **Yang qi**; one **black** is **Yin qi**. When **red and black** coalesce externally, they are called **Red Lead** and **Black Lead**—the foundation of the **Great Elixir**. Cultivating this for a **year** ensures **life and essence** are mastered.

The **3×5=15 Dao**—when the body unites yet **qi** does not—**Celestial Dragon** and **Earth Horse**, **Heaven’s Inquiry** and **Earth’s Mother**. Heaven is the **solar essence**; Earth is the **lunar essence**. When **Yin and Yang** unite in harmony, they reclaim their roots—this is the **Return to Origin, Reversion to the Embryo, and Embryonic Breathing**.

Laozi said: *"The spirit of the valley does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female."* Why? For **one exhalation**, **qi** rises from **three cun**, governing the **left kidney**—this is the **Three Yang**, corresponding to the **Sun**. **One inhalation**, **qi** descends into **three cun**, governing the **right kidney**—this is the **Three Yin**, corresponding to the **Moon**. **Six breaths**—day and night, following the **Sun and Moon’s** movements—comprise **13,500 breaths**, **54,000 movements**, and **810 zhang** of **qi** and blood circulation. Thus, **blood and qi** flow like pearls day and night throughout the body.

**Nourishing Vessel** circulates **Yang** on the left, its **morning course** spanning **25 degrees**; **Defensive Vessel** circulates **Yin** on the right, its **morning course** also **25 degrees**. **Blood** is **Nourishing**; **qi** is **Defensive**. Each **inhalation and exhalation** moves **qi** and blood through **six cun**. In **270 breaths**, they traverse **16.2 zhang**—one full cycle of the body. Thus, **life and essence** depend solely on **breathing**.

**Qi’s** outward flow is the **Sun Soul**; its inward flow is the **Moon Specter**. The **Classic** says: *"Exhale with the Sun, inhale with the Moon—preserve the true breaths. The Sun Soul and Moon Specter are the two true **qi**; the enlightened become true immortals. Refining and ingesting for a thousand days, the body—lacking **Yin**—how could it die?"*

This is the **Jade Capital’s** domain, where **Sun and Moon** divide day and night—the **breath of Heaven and Earth**. **Breathing** is the **breath of humanity**. The **Sun** is **Yang**; the **Moon** is **Yin**. Their interplay generates **life and death**. If **Yin and Yang** do not unite, **Sun and Moon** do not align, and the **four seasons** lack measure, how could there be **life and death**?

What is **steady breathing**? When **breathing aligns with circulation**, the **Primordial Fire** internally consumes the **Four Great Elements**. In **1,000 days**, it may cease—awaiting the **five viscera’s** non-communication, the **six bowels’** non-transmission, the **hundred vessels’** stillness, the **hundred passes’** self-resonance, **spirit and qi’s** self-mastery, and **ten thousand transformations’** self-regulation. This is **Embryonic Breathing’s return to the Origin**.

I possess the **Great Elixir’s Divine Embryo’s Golden Furnace**, its **three-tiered crucible**. The **upper tier** is the **Yellow Elixir Court**; beneath it is **water**; beneath **water** is **earth**; beneath **earth** is **wood**. To its left is **Fixed Salvation**; to its right, **Peng Hu**. Externally, it is marked: *"Scene of Death, Sudden Opening, Rest, Birth, Injury, and Blockage"*—thus safeguarding the **furnace**.

The **Great Medicine**, **one jin**, corresponds to **384 hexagrams**; within, only **15 liǎng** are used, totaling **360 hexagrams**. The remaining **one liǎng** governs **four hexagrams and 24 lines**—the **pivotal use of Qián, Kūn, Kǎn, and Lǐ**—this is the **Heavenly Purity’s Fire Transformation**.

A **hexagram of six lines** represents the **six qi**, **one part**; a **single line** is **one qián**. The **Tài hexagram’s** upper three lines correspond to **one exhalation**, rising **three cun**—the **Three Yang**; its lower three lines correspond to **one inhalation**, descending **three cun**—the **Three Yin**.

What is the **internal use of hexagrams**? **Sixteen breaths** equal **64 movements**, totaling **96 cun**. In **four cycles**, **16 breaths** become **64 breaths**; **96 cun** become **384 cun**. Thus, the *Yì* is **cun**, **qián**, **liǎng**, and **days**—all **384**.

The **six Yang lines**—each **36 strategies**—total **216 strategies** for **Qián**; the **six Yin lines**—each **24 strategies**—total **144 strategies** for **Kūn**.

The **384 lines**—half Yang, half Yin—**combine into 11,520 strategies**.

At the **Winter Solstice**, **one Yang arises**: at the **first moment of the Child hour**, the **Lesser Yang qi** begins, traversing **36 degrees**, aligning with the **Jia-Yi qi**, moving through the **Earthly Gate**. Each degree advances **six moments**, totaling **216 moments** of motion. Then, **Lesser Yang** and **Greater Yang** proceed as before, covering **66 degrees**, completing **180 degrees**—this is the **Qiányuán (Primordial Heaven) Water Star’s** minor response to the **Great Vehicle’s Way**, accounting for **648 moments**.

At the **Summer Solstice**, **one Yin arises**: at the **first moment of the Wu hour**, the **Lesser Yin qi** begins, traversing **36 degrees**, aligning with the **Geng-Xin qi**, moving through the **Celestial Gate**. Each degree advances **four moments**, totaling **144 moments** of motion. Then, **Lesser Yin** and **Greater Yin** proceed as before, covering **36 degrees**, completing **180 degrees**—this is the **Kūnyuán (Primordial Earth) Fire Star’s** minor response to the **Great Vehicle’s Way**, accounting for **432 moments**. Together, **Yin and Yang** traverse **1,152 moments**.

This is the **number of the Sun and Moon’s celestial revolution**, governing the motion of all things.

**Volume 25 of *Dao Gōng***
**太清养生上篇**
**太清养生下篇**
*Collected by Zēng Cáo in "Zhǒuhòu Sāngchéng Piān"*

The **Dao is distant as the sky**—who can ascend it?
**Pointing to the lofty steps**, yet still one must climb them stage by stage.

Master Lü Dongbin of Pure Yang declared:

*"I cultivate the Celestial Rank, and thus the Human Rank may be abandoned;
I awaken to True Emptiness, and thus the vulgar emptiness is despised.

For I know the laws of Yin and Yang’s ascent and descent within the Two Principles,
And the roots of life and nature return to the One Qi.

Its origin: there is a husband and wife;
Its departure: there are three sons and three daughters.
The Golden Son plucks the yellow sprouts from the Nine Palaces’ terrace,
The Jade Maiden gathers the white snow from the Twelve Towers.

Fire arises from water, to divide the Eight Trigrams;
Yin refines Yang within, to distinguish the Nine Regions.

Thus, the Three Fields harmonize, and the Fire Dragon emerges at the dusk crossroads—
When the thousand-day work is complete, one wanders the Penglai Isles.

Its essentials number eighteen:
Seven for the minor attainment, six for the medium attainment, five for the great attainment.

Pure Yang Master says:
One swallow, one exhale, one exhale with ten massages—
Practiced long, wrinkles diminish, the complexion glows.

This is the Heavenly Child’s immortality, the *Gèn* Trigram.
What is meant by this?

Human desires and emotions—six passions, seven sentiments—
Daily wage war within, so joy, anger, sorrow, and delight
Fester in the heart, injuring the vital qi."*

「I awaken in the morning and use my tongue to stir the saliva in my mouth,
swallowing all the foul and impure fluids, then exhale them afterward.
With both hands, I massage my face—left and right—
to disperse the stagnant *qi* of the mind, allowing the true *qi* to surge upward
and enter my face, thus restoring my youthful complexion.

Pure Yang Master says:
Massage once, then exhale once, alternating hands left and right,
until the count of ninety-nine is complete—then the pure Yang will not dissipate.
This is the method of gathering fire to boil the sea—
the *Qián* Trigram.
What is meant by this?

When one’s desires and emotions—six passions, seven sentiments—
are stirred by external things, the vital Yang is consumed,
and the true *qi* is lost.
Thus, illness and aging arise, and aging leads to death—
is this not because the root Yang is depleted and the *qi* grows weak?

At the hours of *Xū* and *Hài*,
I press and rub my navel eighty-one times,
then massage my hands eighty-one times, left and right.
In nine days, results appear; in eighty-one days, success is achieved.

Pure Yang Master says:
One inhale for every nine exhales,
retain three, release seven,
settle the breath and observe inwardly—
no matter the task, it will be accomplished.
This is the harmonization of Yin and Yang—
the *Zhèn* Trigram.
What is meant by this?

When eating and drinking,
sometimes one takes too much, sometimes too little,
and the times vary—cold or hot.
Suddenly, diseases may arise in the five *zàng* organs and six *fǔ* viscera.
I then draw in the *qi* through my nose,
until it reaches nine parts within me,
and cut off the breath by swallowing,
preventing it from flowing freely.
Closing my eyes and quieting my mind,
I retain three and release seven,
beginning to treat the illness by visualizing its location.
If the *qi* is too intense, it becomes difficult to control.

Thus, I must open my mouth and slowly exhale,
without forcing the breath.
If the illness has not yet healed,
I repeat the process until the count of three times five is reached—
no illness remains unhealed.

In daily practice at the hour of *Mǎo*,
when the Yin of the heart descends and the Yang of the kidneys ascends,
and the two *qi*s meet,
I follow the method to regulate them:
allowing the *qi* and fluids to harmonize and generate,
until results appear, then cease.

Pure Yang Master says:
Close the door and swallow upward,
press the lower *guān* and massage downward,
settle the intention and observe inwardly—
the root Yang will naturally suffice.
This is the method of gathering fire and returning to the root—
the *Qián* Trigram.
What is meant by this?

When battling external matters,
the root Yang is consumed, and the true *qi* is lost.
At the hours of *Xū* and *Hài*,
I close my mouth and swallow the *qi*,
press the lower *guān* and massage the *pángguāng*,
then gently stimulate my abdomen.
With steady focus and no distraction,
I observe inwardly and retain the thought,
directing the heart’s fire downward,
while the external kidney fire enters and unites at the *Mìngfǔ*—
when results appear, I cease.

Pure Yang Master says:
Daily, rise and repeat the coiled-knee posture,
exhale like thunder and inhale like rain,
elevate the body and observe inwardly,
sequentially applying the movements of bow and arrow.
This is the method of releasing fire to refine the form—
the *Gèn* Trigram.
What is meant by this?

The *qi* of joy, anger, grief, and delight,
accumulates in the four limbs by evening.
The blood stagnates, and the channels and collaterals become blocked.
I rise in the morning, coil my knees, and sit upright,
massaging my face with both hands from below.
I swallow the foul and impure fluids, as before.
Then, I exhale the *qi*,
tap my teeth,
to drain the accumulated *qi* of the heart and gather my spirit.
When done, I lower my body,
stretching and contracting my limbs
as if drawing a bow and loosing an arrow—
thus, the channels and collaterals open,
and the *qi* flows while the blood circulates.
With time, the illness is permanently removed;
when results appear, I cease.

Pure Yang Master says:
The return to the wife’s chamber,
the moon reaching the Yang Palace,
the bottom of the Peach Blossom Spring’s waves—
the Dragon and Tiger meeting.
This is the union of Dragon and Tiger—
the *Lí* Trigram.
What is meant by this?

Within the body, what is easily dispersed is the root *qi*;
what is difficult to generate is the true essence.
Thus, if the essence is scant,
it cannot generate *qi*;
if the *qi* is dispersed,
it cannot generate essence.
One must make the *qi* and essence unite to form semen,
then refine the semen into essence—
this is the method of *Jièjì* (completion).

At the hour of *Wǔ*,
when the kidney *qi* reaches the heart,
I prevent it from ascending further,
and let it emerge solely through the mouth—
this is the method of *Jièjì*.
Then, I hold the saliva in my mouth,
neither spitting nor swallowing,
settling my spirit and awareness inwardly,
as my breath flows gently through the nose—
thus, the kidney *qi* and the heart *qi* naturally unite,
becoming true *qi* and true essence.
The Yang Dragon and Yin Tiger,
by this union, transform into the Yellow Sprout.

Pure Yang Master says:
The Yellow Mother unites husband and wife,
the same domain where Heaven and Earth harmonize—
the Yang *guān* must be pressed.
This is the method of refining the elixir—
the *Qián* and *Kūn* Trigrams.
What is meant by this?

Within the *qi* sea,
there is true Yin and true Yang.
They yearn for each other in the spleen,
encountering the lung’s fluids to transport them,
harmonizing countless times before entering the Yellow Court.
At the hours of *Xū* and *Hài*,
I gently stimulate my abdomen—
this is the pressing of the Yang *guān*,
to prevent the *qi* from ascending and instead refine it downward.
This is but a minor attainment;
it has not yet reached the medium attainment.

Pure Yang Master says:
Three sons, three daughters,
bowing and rising to open the cosmos,
gradually ascending and storing—
pass the *guān* without haste.
This is the *Zhǒuhòu* (posture) method.
What is meant by this?」

The true *qi* and true essence—
when they unite, they descend into the elixir field.
Thus, the fire’s timing is without flaw,
nourishing the true embryo
and transforming it into pure Yang.

It begins at the hour of *Zǐ*,
after *qi* is born,
employing the *Zhǒuhòu* method
to circulate into the Upper Palace—
this is the Dao of returning essence to nourish the brain,
by which one may attain longevity and keen vision.

What are the three sons?
*Zhèn* (Thunder), *Kǎn* (Water), *Gèn* (Mountain).

What are the three daughters?
*Sūn* (Wind), *Lí* (Fire), *Duì* (Lake).

When I bow my body,
the kidneys naturally unite,
and the *qi* gathers;
when I rise,
the kidneys naturally separate,
and the *qi* disperses.

Piercing through the *wěihéng* (tailbone),
it ascends from the back,
soaring into the brain—
this cannot be achieved in a single day.
It must ascend gradually,
storing the thought of the Dragon-Tiger River Chariot,
so that it may rise from below.

Yet if the kidneys’ void-Yang enters the crown,
it will clog above and generate heat—
thus, one must pass the *guān* without haste.

Pure Yang Master says:
The young son and the elder daughter contend in flight,
the Dragon and Tiger soaring into the Heavenly Pool,
transforming into sweet rain.

This is the *Zhǒuhòu* method of flying golden crystal.
What is meant by this?

Once I apply the *Zhǒuhòu* method,
gradually ascending and storing thought,
until the kidneys’ *qi* enters the brain,
then I practice the flying golden crystal.

Thus, during the *zǐ* hour,
the kidneys’ *qi* arises,
and merges with the lungs’ *qi*.
Then the kidneys’ *qi* seeks to exchange with the liver’s *qi*.
The lungs’ *qi* stored within the kidneys—
this is the golden crystal.

At this time, with focused practice,
as before in bowing and rising,
one strike passes through the Three Passes,
entering the Upper Official,
harmonizing with the Body Sea,
sipping the Heavenly Nectar—
this is the true yin divine water.

When using *gèn* (Mountain), it is called the young son;
when using *xùn* (Wind), it is called the elder daughter.
The left of *Zhǒuhòu* is the Dragon,
the right is the Tiger;
the crown is the Heavenly Pool,
the divine water is sweet rain.
From *gèn* to *xùn*,
one strike enters the crown.

Then, refine the marrow of the crown into water.
If the spirit in the brain grows dim and sluggish,
temporarily store it in the lower body,
then shortly rise again,
entering the crown to refine it.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"Kill the husband, save the wife—
follow her mother.
Nurture with her mother,
for the Five Phases have their lords.
This is the elixir of jade nectar.
What is meant by this?"*

I observe the logic of the Five Phases:
That which generates me—
this is called the mother;
That which I generate—
this is called the son;
That which overcomes me—
this is called the husband;
That which I overcome—
this is called the wife.

If, in the month of spring,
the liver thrives while the spleen weakens,
this is wood strong and earth weak.
I then diminish the liver and strengthen the spleen.
The spleen is the mother—
the heart is its mother,
for fire generates earth.
When fire is strong,
it is the *lí* (Fire) hexagram.

The Five Phases have generation and conquest,
the Five Viscera have flourishing and decline—
thus water, wood, fire, earth, and metal
generate one another as mother and child;
fire, metal, earth, wood, and water
conquer one another as husband and wife.

If practicing the swallowing method,
one must rely on the Five Phases’ conquests.
This Dao—
after flying the golden crystal,
I practice both.

The key lies in recognizing the logic of the Five Phases.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"Fire lodges in the Dark Palace,
water aids the Elixir Platform,
before noon, ascend frequently—
the jade flower blooms of its own accord.
This is the refining of the form by jade nectar.
What is meant by this?"*

To gather herbs as elixir,
without pure Yang *qi*,
they cannot be refined.
Thus, after *Zhǒuhòu* flying golden crystal enters the brain,
refined for long,
if one fears excess,
and yin is insufficient,
then exhale the jade nectar,
refining the form instead.

Before noon, beginning in *gèn* (Mountain) time,
ascend the body to ignite fire,
refining the form.
Fire lodging in the Dark Palace—
refined by pure Yang *qi*;
water aiding the Elixir Platform—
nourished by jade nectar water.

Why ascend frequently before noon?
Refined by *qi*, ascending to fill the body,
then the blood transforms into white grease,
into jade flowers—
lustrous and pure white,
the effect of refining the form.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"When one Yang first arises,
lightly ascend and store afterward,
the Dragon coils, the Tiger encircles,
water fills the high source.
This is the elixir of golden nectar."*

What is meant by this?

The *jade nectar* elixir—its count does not exceed one hundred and eight, then swallow it immediately.
Swallowing, refining—its count varies, yet its timing lies in the four seasons.
It can nourish the Inner Elixir and burn the four limbs—this is the *golden nectar* elixir.

When the *qi* of the kidneys and the essence of the lungs enter the brain,
they transform into *shen* water.
Thus, the three pure yin *qi* meet the pure Yang above and below—this is *jièjí* [fulfilled].

From the *zǐ* [Water] hour, when the kidney *qi* is born,
one may lightly recline the spine, subtly store the body,
gather the kidney *qi*, strike the three passes once,
and enter straight into the *níwán* [mud ball],
where it merges with true marrow and transforms into *shen* water—
then it descends, like sweet dew nourishing the heart.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"After the *zǐ* hour, do not tire of frequent ascension—
golden light fills the body, yin exhausted, Yang pure.
This is the *golden nectar* refining of form."*

What is meant by this?

When the *golden essence* enters the brain, it transforms into *golden nectar*;
the *golden nectar* returns to its origin, transforming into elixir—
three times, and one may achieve longevity.

I wish to shed its husk—
when the *golden nectar* descends from the Upper Elixir Field,
I ascend the body and ignite fire,
so that true fire rises once,
meeting the *golden water* at the side of the *jade pool*—
this is called *jièjí*.

Then, one round of *golden millet* forms, as large as a grain of rice.
One elixir pearl appears, and a golden light arises,
encircling the body—this is called *golden nectar* refining of form.
When the refining of form is complete,
only then does one refine *qi* into *shen* and shed its husk.

Thus, after the *zǐ* hour,
when the kidney and lung essences strike once into the *níwán*,
and one nods and swallows,
the *golden nectar* comes naturally.
Before *jièjí*, the *golden nectar* is refined by fire—this is the elixir.

In general, after each swallow and refinement,
one should ascend frequently.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"Observing the *zhōngchéng* [middle completion],
one then knows the path to *dàchéng* [great completion] is supreme.
When the sun and moon are at their peak,
husband and wife both become immortals—
igniting fire at the proper time,
*qi* naturally ascends to the *cháoyuán* [morning origin].
This is gathering *shen* and ascending to the *cháoyuán*."*

What is meant by this?

The *jade nectar* elixir previously mentioned—
slaying the husband to save the wife,
yet seeking the mother—
I understand this already.

When the liver is strong, the spleen must be weak—why is this so?
Wood is the husband;
Earth is the wife;
Fire is the child;
Water is the mother.

If the liver is strong and the husband is slain,
one cannot exert effort below.
If the spleen is weak and the wife is slayed,
while fire is strong and the mother is sought,
the method of *separation* involves dousing it,
thus saving the spleen.

Therefore, when ascending to the *cháoyuán*,
though one does not violate the principles of the Five Phases’ mutual generation and restraint,
one must ignite fire at the proper time
to refine the *true qi*,
ensuring all *yin* is fully exhausted.

If, during the months of spring,
when the liver is strong,
one ignites fire to refine the liver,
and during the hours of *chén*, *xū*, *chǒu*, and *wèi*,
when the spleen is weak,
one ignites fire to refine the spleen,
then husband and wife both become immortals.

Now, when the liver is strong,
in its month, its day, its hour—
this is the hour of the *three unions*,
its name being *three flowers*.

The *three flowers* are the *three yangs*.
Though fire is ignited,
one still fears the lung’s strength
and harm to the liver.

At the hour of *duì*,
on days *gēng* and *xīn*,
one must not neglect this function even by a hair’s breadth.

By this analogy, the rest cannot differ!

I follow this method,
and thus the *true qi* merges with the *original qi*,
the *original qi* merges with the *true qi*,
and the *three qi* merge to transform into the *three flowers*.

Then the *three flowers* gather at the crown,
the *five qi* ascend to the *cháoyuán*,
merging into the *yang shen*,
and forming the body of *pure yang*—
this is having a body beyond the body,
abandoning the husk and ascending as an immortal.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"Cease the breath by the embryo,
generate the spirit by the qi,
retain the breath to refine the qi,
the form responds to the *true nature of Heaven*."*

And again:
*"Nurture the yang and refine the yin,
foreward reverence and backward submission,
steady the breath and observe inwardly,
sufficient counting brings forth the true*—
this is the refinement of qi into spirit.

What is meant by this?

The method of *embryonic breathing* does not lie in
the breath being few when exhaled or many when inhaled,
but in the union of *Dragon* and *Tiger*,
whereby the *spirit-embryo* is formed.

When the *spirit-embryo* is complete,
the breath naturally ceases.

Those who close the breath to refine it,
cease the breath to refine the spirit—
this is not the *Great Dao*.

I have never seen one who could succeed with this.

When the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are at their peak,
ascend the body and ignite fire,
lower the *sovereign fire* to its proper domain—
thus the breath flows naturally upward,
the qi does not ascend,
and the spirit does not disperse.
This requires no more than ten thousand breaths.

I refine the liver,
and a *green* hue emerges;
I refine the heart,
and a *red* hue emerges;
I refine the lungs,
and a *white* hue emerges;
I refine the kidneys,
and a *black* hue emerges;
I refine the spleen,
and a *yellow* hue emerges.

Having refined all five *zàng* organs,
each for seventy-two days with two extra,
this completes three hundred and sixty-two days of work.

Next, in one year,
one should refine each organ daily,
ascending once per day.

Now, within the state of *stillness*,
if one perceives the *carriage and cavalry* and *female musicians* in their splendid array,
one should consider that *yin* ghosts and *outer demons* may mingle with the *yang shen*—
one must practice *inner observation*,
igniting the *true fire of the three meditations*,
and burning the body,
thus exchanging the fate of mortal and immortal.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"When both inner and outer are still,
the heart is cleansed and observed inwardly,
the flames envelop the body,
and the music and revelry resound through the heavens—
this is what is called *inner observation* in the exchange of mortal and immortal."*

Within the year,
I refine all five *zàng* organs,
and thus the *five qi* ascend to the *cháoyuán*.

The month is governed by the *Purple River Vehicle*,
which enters the *Heavenly Palace*—
then *yin* demons may deceive,
posing as *carriage and cavalry*,
and emitting their *sheng* and *háng* sounds,
mingling with the *yang shen*.

Those who practice the Dao mistakenly believe this to be real,
content with their mortal form,
and thus cannot abandon their substance and become immortals.

Better to have both inner and outer still,
neither emerging nor retreating,
the heart cleansed and thoughts quieted,
observing the *Heavenly Cauldron*—
then the clouds of the *five directions* rise above,
and the *female musicians* and *carriage and cavalry* array themselves below.

These *yin* demons are false—
who would call them true?

My *pure yang spirit* is called *Heaven’s True Nature*,
the *original sovereign of Heaven*.

At this time,
returning to its original form,
the *true spirit* guards and protects,
retreating to the inner chambers of the *Heavenly Palace*—
thus one can abandon the husk and leave the *dusty nest*.

If one does not discern truth from falsehood
and harms the *yang shen*,
one will become mad and easy to sway,
wandering in perverse ways,
and will not escape death.

Though the form may not decay,
what benefit is there to the Dao?

Thus, during *inner observation*,
one must not tire of ascending the body and igniting fire—
then the false will disperse,
and the true will ascend.

Fire has three names:
*burning the body*,
*subduing demons*,
and *ascending to Heaven*—
the *cháoyuán* of the day.

Once one has reached the *Heavenly Palace*,
it is essential to regulate the spirit with proper method.

Pure Yang Master says:
*"Seven-layered *jewel pagoda*,
three-tiered *red mansion*—
when the time comes, do not fear,
for once it emerges, it is hard to retrieve.*
This is the return and emergence of the spirit,
what is called *regulating the spirit*."

The regulation of the spirit to emerge from its husk
must occur on the day of the *Heavenly Palace*,
through *inner observation*.

The *red mansion* is the *three fields*;
the *jewel pagoda* is the *seven qi*.

From below upward,
once reaching the top,
one must not be afraid.

If the *yang shen* is not pure,
*yin* ghosts will mingle with it.

Thus, the count of fire
is not a matter of excess.

If the *true qi* is not firm,
when the body emerges,
it is easily startled—
the gathering is dispersed,
and the body returns,
which is difficult indeed!

Thus the ancient *perfected ones* had the appearance
of *unfastened robes and unbound hair*.

If one desires to attain without fear,
and to emerge yet easily return,
nothing surpasses
the three hundred days of *herb gathering* and *fire regulation*,
and the five hundred days of *form refinement* and *qi merging*—
ascending and descending with measured count.

When igniting fire within the water,
even after the elixir,
one need not fear its excess.

Thus the demons scatter while the spirit gathers—
no need for crimson towers or precious pagodas.

Only by contemplating within the Yellow Court,
do the Five Clouds converge,
and the Fire Dragon leaps forth
amidst crimson light and violet qi,
straight out into the dim thoroughfares.

When it emerges, it fears nothing.
When it passes, it does not disperse.

My outer body has another body—
like a younger brother—
only then can one speak of the Dao of dividing form.

Thus, before completing the prior work,
how could one divide form and emerge?

This Dao is difficult beyond measure.

If the yin spirits do not disperse within meditation,
and mistakenly exit through the Celestial Gate,
then one cannot be a Pure Yang Immortal.

Pure Yang Child said:
*"Once the Fire Dragon emerges,
one must recognize the Golden Light—
coming and going without hesitation,
quickly reaching the Immortal Realm—
this is the transcendence of dividing form."*

When the elixir is complete,
true qi arises naturally;
true qi arises, and the yang spirit gathers naturally.

How does the spirit gather?
It clings to the qi.
How does the qi gather?
It clings to the elixir.

When the spirit emerges, it takes qi as form;
when the spirit returns, it halts the qi with form.

Its emergence is like a cicada’s molt.
Thus its husk—
if left in great rivers, yields pearls;
if hidden in famous mountains, yields jade;
if dwelling in the world, moves freely at ease.

Some, weary of the world, depart—
summoning yin spirits to ride phoenixes and dragons,
and attend at Taiwei.

The sovereign of Taiwei examines their merit,
and grants passage—
from the Lower Isle to the Middle Isle,
from the Middle Isle to the Upper Isle;
when their merit is complete, they return to the Cavern Heavens.

As the *Zhouyi* *Jinzi* says:
*"The Creative governs its beginning,
the Receptive encompasses its end;
this diminutive form
moves easily within."*

The Daoist Zhang Hugong, surnamed Huangzi,
in the Xianfu era, over seventy years old,
went to Yue to seek the recluse Zhou Cheng but did not meet him.
Instead, he saw the bridge attendant, the water spirit Li Bai,
who gave him this text, saying:
*"At the head, seven orifices;
throughout the body, four limbs—
the Creative and Receptive are fixed.
The Creative governs its beginning,
the Receptive encompasses its end—
nobility and lowliness are set.
Yin descends to six,
yang ascends to nine—
the firm and yielding are determined."*

Awakening opens with yang, closing with yin—thus fortune and misfortune arise.
Pure yin seeks the male, pure yang the female—thus transformation becomes manifest.

The nine orifices resonate together,
the five viscera communicate,
the six palaces mutually rely,
the three palaces mutually govern,
the eight trigrams mutually support,
the five phases mutually illuminate.

Balance it with the eldest son,
operate it with the youngest daughter,
shape it with the aged vessel,
name it with the crone,
weaken it with the infant,
harmonize it with the wet nurse.

Ears and eyes are pivotal,
mouth and nose are auxiliary,
saliva and fluids are balanced,
marrow and bones are firm,
the palaces are luminous,
spirit and soul are protected.

When yang matures, it becomes Father;
when yin matures, it becomes Mother.

The earth yields the *liquor* spring,
the heavens descend sweet dew.

Fire is born of wood,
metal is born of water.

Life arises from spirit,
death arises from the ghostly.

Spirit ascends to celestial patterns,
the ghostly descends to earthly forms.

Wood is the mother of fire,
water is the child of metal.

Two woods form a forest—brothers;
two fires form a blaze—sisters.

Wood is the wife of metal,
water is the husband of fire.

Lead is the lineage of fire,
mercury is the ancestor of water.

Lead is easily known,
mercury is simply skilled.

When easily known, lead returns;
when simply skilled, mercury returns.

Lead’s return brings affinity,
mercury’s return brings efficacy.

Affinity ensures longevity,
efficacy ensures greatness.

When simplicity is attained,
then the celestial chamber is established.

Thus, the Daoist observes the body as the *Hexagram*,
studies nature as the *pharmacon*,
with the sun and moon urging,
wind and rain pressing close—
the azure dragon cradles the furnace,
the flying *Lian* beats the cauldron,
the elixir glows resplendent,
the metallic essence shimmers,
melting into rivers,
congealing into peaks.

Refining *qi* here,
separating the clear and turbid;
binding the *Word* here,
illuminating life and death.

Yin and yang return,
balancing transformation;
darkness and clarity alternate,
following day and night;
water and fire chase,
determining high and low.

Thus, *Zhen* is movement—the *Qinglong* symbol;
*Li* is adornment—the *Zhuque* symbol;
*Dui* is joy—the *Baihu* symbol;
*Kan* is abyss—the *Xuanwu* symbol;
*Sun* is compliance—the *Tengshe* symbol;
*Gen* is stillness—the *Goucheng* symbol.

Thus, the Daoist’s dwelling is secure in the *Qinglong* palace,
his delight is in the *Baihu* carriage,
his opening is in the celestial union,
his closure is in the earthly shoulder.

Thus, to the left, observe the dragon and bind the east;
to the right, observe the tiger and play in the west;
to the south, observe the sun and rest at noon;
to the north, observe the moon and play at midnight.

Thus, heaven aids him—
fortune knows no obstruction.

Wood is *Jia-Yi*,
fire is *Bing-Ding*,
water is *Ren-Gui*,
metal is *Geng-Xin*,
earth is *Wu-Ji*.

*Yin-Mao* harms earth,
*Si-Wu* harms metal,
*Shen-You* harms wood,
*Hai-Zi* harms fire,
the four seasons harm water.

Thus, the ears’ alignment lies in *Gen*,
the eyes’ division lies in *Kan*,
the nose’s discernment lies in *Zhen*,
the mouth’s verification lies in *Dui*,
the yin’s leakage lies in *Li*,
the yang’s seepage lies in *Sun*.

Thus, the body has high and low,
*qi* has waxing and waning,
nature has firmness and emptiness,
things have decline and flourishing.

The *Dao* points to its destination;
*virtue* points to its action.

Nature aligns with heaven and earth,
lifespan matches heaven and earth,
law parallels heaven and earth.

Thus, knowing the root of heaven and earth,
recognizing the desires of parents.

Father’s essence is *hun* (spirit),
Mother’s blood is *po* (ethereal soul).

Do not scatter the *hun*,
do not separate the *po*—
thus, above, recognize celestial mechanisms,
below, penetrate human schemes,
enjoying the longevity of metal and stone,
transforming the flesh into gold and jade!

When the ears lose *Gen*, they cannot hear;
when the eyes lose *Kan*, they cannot see;
when the nose loses *Zhen*, they cannot smell;
when the mouth loses *Dui*, they cannot speak;
when the leakage loses *Li*, they cannot move;
when the seepage loses *Sun*, they cannot eat.

Thus, the sun has *hun*,
the moon has *po*.

To weave heaven and earth is *wen* (pattern),
one yin and one yang is *Dao* (Way).

To scorch is fire,
to moisten is water;
to warm is to seek dryness,
to follow is to seek dampness;
to command is by resonant harmony,
to steam is by mutual *qi* seeking.

When hidden, it is the *Potential Dragon*;
when revealed, it is the *Apparent Dragon*;
when nurtured with joy, it is the *Human Dragon*;
when called, it leaps—the *Leaping Dragon*;
when floated, it ascends—the *Flying Dragon*;
when elevated, it soars—the *Ascendant Dragon*.

The six dragons ride the times without constraint,
the common folk use them unknowingly—
thus, the *Junzi’s* Way endures,
the petty Way fades;
superior and inferior communicate,
and purpose is fulfilled;
heaven and earth respond,
and life emerges.

Manifest to the sage,
concealed in practice—
refining yang while diminishing yin,
the true water’s function is born,
the true fire’s function is wondrous.

The *Mao* position is true fire;
the *You* position is true water.

The fire-womb position is *Zi*,
the water-womb position is *Wu*,
the western flank position is the sun,
the eastern remnant position is the moon,
the northwest tilt position is *Qian*,
the southern void position is *Xun*.

*Qian* terminates at *Shangjiu*—*Gen*,
*Kun* terminates at *Shangliu*—*Xun*.

To cut at *Si* is *逆* (perverse),
to cut at *Hai* is *顺* (compliant).

Dragon and tiger consorting is *xian* (transcendence),
yin and yang unfathomable is *shen* (divinity).

Speaking of heaven, it does not decay;
speaking of earth, it does not sink;
speaking of fire, it does not extinguish;
speaking of water, it does not exhaust;
speaking of wood, it does not rot;
speaking of metal, it does not corrode.

The *Qian* is pure in its closure, true in its opening—thus great life arises from it;
The *Kun* is even in its closure, wondrous in its opening—thus broad life arises from it.

Ears correspond to *Jia-Xu*,
eyes to *Jia-Zi*,
nose to *Jia-Yin*,
mouth to *Jia-Shen*,
the *Xie* (urinary) to *Jia-Wu*,
the *Lòu* (menstrual) to *Jia-Chen*.

The Dao is subtle indeed—
thus the *xian* (transcendent) uses it to cultivate nature;
The Dao is silent indeed—
thus the *zhenren* (true person) takes it to preserve life.

When nature is cultivated, it becomes empty—
empty, it clears and mirrors Heaven;
When life is preserved, it becomes harmonious—
harmonious, it is wondrous and follows Earth.

Heaven sends sweet rain,
Earth grows grasses and trees,
Mountains and marshes circulate *qi*,
Dragons and serpents rise from the land.

Parents form the body—
the Dao operates within it;
Sun and moon transform their essence—
the Dao nourishes within it.

Lead and mercury endure—
the gate of nature and life;
Dragon and tiger persist—
the source of nature and life.

The *xian* perceives the luminous *Shangdantian*—
thus called *Shangqing* (Upper Clarity);
The *xian* perceives the flickering *Zhongdantian*—
thus called *Zhongqing* (Middle Clarity);
The *xian* perceives the congealed *Xiadantian*—
thus called *Xiàqing* (Lower Clarity).

The *Xuánwǔ* (Black Tortoise) Upper Pass cannot be opened;
The *Gōuchén* (Worm) Middle Pass cannot be split;
The *Qīnglóng* (Green Dragon) Lower Pass cannot be revealed.

The White Tiger’s Upper Corpse cannot be nourished;
The Vermilion Bird’s Middle Corpse cannot be detained;
The *Téngshé* (Soaring Serpent) Lower Corpse cannot be kept.

Close it, and inner stillness arises;
Open it, and outer movement arises.

Opening and closing must manifest in transformation—
transformation determines nature and life.

The *wūhè* (owl) in the yin—
its child responds to it;
I have a fine cup—
let us polish it together.

It is said:
The true person lowers its dragon and draws forth its spirit-sword—
then a thousand *li* away, it responds;
how much closer does it answer!

It subdues its tiger and raises its spirit-torch—
then ten thousand *li* away, it follows;
how much closer does it follow!

The sword lowers its dragon,
the torch subdues its tiger.

Dragon and tiger are the chariot of the divine and transcendent;
When the chariot is assembled, it is the master of ascending to Heaven.

The divine and transcendent are the gateways of dragon and tiger;
When the gateways open, it is the mechanism of entering and exiting.

*Tóngrén* (harmonizing people) first weeps and then laughs.

It is said:
From the mundane to the sacred—
the path of the *xian*;
From Earth to Heaven—
the path of the *zhenren*.

Dragon and tiger in harmony—
Heaven and Earth become gold;
Water and fire mingling—
the Milky Way forms.

Do not leave the courtyard—
no blame.

It is said:
The three delusions arise—
the six obstructions take root.
Hearing lewd sounds—
loses hearing;
Seeing splendid colors—
loses sight;
Smelling fragrant scents—
loses thought;
Speaking much—
loses resolve.

Yin movement loses true essence,
Yang dispersion loses primordial *qi*.

Thus the true person embraces and does not act,
is cautious and does not reveal.

Ears and eyes are deceived by allure,
mouth and nose by greed,
lust and desire by exhaustion,
thought and deliberation by turmoil.

The domain of ghosts and spirits,
the lure of thieves and bandits.

The five positions harmonize—
each has its union,
thus transformation is complete,
and spirits are moved.

It is said:
A hundred methods of *jīndān* (elixir) exist—
its essence lies in *shuǐhuá* (spirit-water) and *huáichí* (flower-pool);
A hundred methods of divine transcendence exist—
its essence lies in *bàoyī shǒuzhōng* (embracing unity, guarding the center).

*Kǎn* symbolizes water,
*Zhèn* symbolizes wood,
*Duì* symbolizes metal,
*Lí* symbolizes fire.

The four symbols are the medicines,
the two *qi* are the furnace—
refine them, then they become empty;
ingest them, and they ascend.

Nine orifices, five viscera—
the body harmonizes, each in its place;
Seven emotions established—
each has its completion;
Ten thousand things hidden in function—
each has its analogy;
Thousand spirits internally supported—
each has its guardian.

Heaven’s numbers proceed in order,
Earth’s numbers are taken in reverse.

The white-gold register,
the green-jade talisman,
the black-water contract,
the vermilion-fire diagram—
these can free one from the dusty world
and enter the layered heavens.

The *Yán Dì* (Flame Emperor) dwells at *Wu*,
the *Hēi Dì* (Black Emperor) at *Zi*,
the *Qīng Dì* (Green Emperor) at *Mǎo*,
the *Bái Dì* (White Emperor) at *Yǒu*.

When the initial yang rises,
pure yin must align with Heaven and Earth—
drawing the essence of dragon and tiger.

Thus the four spirits enter the cauldron,
nine transformations forge the elixir—
boil it and nourish it,
flow it and ingest it.

The common person’s *qi* contains four Daoist methods;
The common person’s body contains five Daoist foundations.

Those who do not cultivate their nature—
are solid yet not empty,
muddled yet not harmonious;
Those who do not preserve their spirit—
are separated yet not united,
called yet not answered;
Those who do not cherish life—
are turbid yet not clear,
active yet not tranquil;
Those who do not refine their heart—
are sick yet not healed,
worn yet not repaired.

Thus it is said: the common person’s *qi* contains four Daoist methods—
this is what is meant.

Those who uphold the virtue of metal—
revere the lungs;
Those who uphold the virtue of water—
revere the kidneys;
Those who uphold the virtue of wood—
revere the liver;
Those who uphold the virtue of fire—
revere the heart;
Those who uphold the virtue of earth—
revere the spleen.

Thus the *xian* prepares to act,
prepares to move.

Their abandonment of color is like mud,
their restraint of emotion is like discarding,
their preservation of purity is like madness,
their nourishing of resolve is like a tortoise.

The utmost essence is not lost—
to preserve in the lungs at the Golden Hall,
what but Heaven’s white essence could suffice here?
Thunderous lightning shatters mountains,
great winds shake the seas,
music halts the clouds,
bells and drums stir the earth—
majestic yet tranquil,
lofty yet solitary,
external sounds do not enter—
to preserve in the kidneys at the Pearl Palace,
what but Heaven’s black essence could suffice here?

The vast is not seen in *Tàishān* (Great Mountain),
the minute is not seen in autumnal down,
patterns are not admired for their brilliance,
eyes do not gaze upon rouge and powder.

「Black and white, if not distinguished,
right and wrong, if not discerned,
are but the common brightness of the multitude—
yet alone in dimness, alone in clarity.

Alone in profound stillness,
penetrating insight within,
resolute light unscattered—
to preserve in the heart at the Vermilion Terrace,
what but Heaven’s crimson essence could suffice here?

Not indulging in the five flavors,
not craving the eight delicacies,
unafraid of great floods,
unworried by severe droughts—
magnificent, as though feasting at a splendid banquet,
vast, as though reaping rich harvests from fertile fields.

Without thought, without action,
without seeking or avoiding,
plentiful yet never lean,
content yet never hungry—
stillness without motion—
to preserve in the spleen at the Jade Chamber,
what but Heaven’s yellow essence could suffice here?

Speechless yet trustworthy,
unsmiling yet joyful,
divine essence moves without haste yet swift,
physical form governs without rigidity yet strict—
the utmost bliss is soundless—
to preserve in the liver at its Azure Tower,
what but Heaven’s azure essence could suffice here?

Thus it is said: the common body of mortals
holds the five roots of the immortal.
This is what is meant.

Ears are *Lù* (六), eyes are *Èr* (二),
nose is *Lùsān* (六三), mouth is *Lùsì* (六四),
yin is *Lùwǔ* (六五), yang is *Shàngliù* (上六).
Mortal man, the root of death.

Yang is *Chūjiǔ* (初九), yin is *Jiǔèr* (九二),
mouth is *Jiǔsān* (九三), nose is *Jiǔsì* (九四),
eyes are *Jiǔwǔ* (九五), ears are *Shàngjiǔ* (上九).
True man, the root of life.

Behold the dragon’s form—
scaled and verdant;
the tiger’s nature—
furred and white;
the sun’s spirit—
daytime and ardent;
the moon’s shadow—
nighttime and frigid.

With this, cultivate the heart,
retreat and conceal with caution.
When Heaven and Earth unite, it is called *Tàipíng* (泰平, Great Harmony);
when sun and moon pursue each other, it is called *Yì* (易, Transformation).
Earthly *qi* ascends, Heavenly *qi* descends.
The sun at its zenith returns, the moon at full wanes.
When the dragon breathes, clouds arise;
when the tiger roars, winds stir.
Pure *qi* ascends to Heaven, yang rises above;
impure *qi* descends to Earth, yin sinks below.
Who could match this?

The discourse says:
The Metal Sovereign is called *Qiān* (铅),
the Wood Sovereign is called *Gǒng* (汞).
Yellow Mother is called True Earth,
Heaven and Earth are called the Furnace,
yin and yang are called the Charcoal,
*Kàn-Lí* (坎离) are called the Medicinals.
Child and Horse are called Advance and Retreat,
Water and Fire are called Action and Reaction,
Rat and Rooster are called Withdrawal and Addition,
Circulation is called the River Chariot,
Clarity is called Heaven,
Alcohol’s refinement is called Golden Flower.

Jade Nectar, distinct, is called Azure Frost and Vermilion Snow,
Nourished, it is called Infant;
Surprised, it is called Yellow Sprout;
The Great Medicine ripens, it is called Nine Transformations;
Cinnabar is perfected, it is called Rebirth,
Infant is marvelous, it is called Spirit,
The light of things is called Treasure Pearl.

Thus, the *Qi* Sea congeals into the Nectar Sea,
the Nectar Sea congeals into the Blood Sea,
the Blood Sea congeals into the Essence Sea,
the Essence Sea congeals into the Bone Sea,
the Bone Sea congeals into the Spirit Sea,
the Spirit Sea congeals into the True Sea.

Therefore, to nourish the sinews, nothing surpasses the liver;
to nourish the *qi*, nothing surpasses the lungs;
to nourish the flesh, nothing surpasses the spleen;
to nourish the marrow, nothing surpasses the kidneys;
to nourish the vessels, nothing surpasses the heart;
to nourish life, nothing surpasses paternal essence,
to nourish nature, nothing surpasses maternal blood.

Thus, the body has nine orifices—
the sage seals them;
the body has five viscera—
the sage refines them;
the body has three passways—
the sage harmonizes them;
the body has three corpses—
the sage annihilates them;
the body has myriad worries—
the sage purges them;
the body has myriad demons—
the sage subdues them;
the body has myriad diseases—
the sage overcomes them;
the body has ten evils—
the sage excises them.

Thus, the heart’s office holds the King,
so it rules without action;
the liver’s office holds the Minister,
so it attains without thought;
the lungs’ office holds the Elder,
so they come without summoning;
the gallbladder’s office holds the General,
so it commands without anger;
the spleen’s office holds the Scholar,
so it acts without orders;
the kidneys’ office holds the Chaste Woman,
so it stops without restraint.

Dragon essence, where the spirit resides—
tiger might, where the shadow dwells—
when dragon essence shines, a fire pearl glows before it;
when tiger might trembles, a water pearl radiates behind it.
If dragon essence is lost, there is no way to see the spirit;
if the spirit is unseen, the fire pearl nearly vanishes.
If tiger might is extinguished, there is no way to see the shadow;
if the shadow is unseen, the water pearl nearly sinks.

Thus, the *Xùn* (巽) advance of *Chūjiǔ* (初九) is called *Bùlòu* (不漏, Unleaking);
the *Lí* (离) advance of *Jiǔèr* (九二) is called *Bùyán* (不言, Speechless);
the *Zhèn* (震) retreat of *Chūliù* (初六) is called *Bùdòng* (不动, Unmoving);
the *Kàn* (坎) retreat of *Liùèr* (六二) is called *Bùkuī* (不窥, Unpeering);
the *Gèn* (艮) retreat of *Liùsān* (六三) is called *Bùwén* (不闻, Unhearing).

Three yangs guarding the form are called *Zhàngfū* (丈夫, True Man),
three yins transforming the form are called *Nánzǐ* (男子, Man).
Seven orifices unmoving are called *Hùndùn* (混沌, Chaos);
two *qi*s interacting are called *Yīnyūn* (氤氲, Misting);
black and white forming substance are called *Dàbǎo* (大宝, Great Treasure);
emptiness generating nature is called *Yuánshén* (元神, Primordial Spirit.

Blocked yet emptied, it resides in *Shàonián Gèn* (少男艮, Young Male);
united yet illuminated, it resides in *Zhōngnán Kàn* (中男坎, Middle Male);
severed yet harmonized, it resides in *Zhǎngnán Zhèn* (长男震, Elder Male);
gathered yet enriched, it resides in *Shàonǚ Duì* (少女兑, Young Female);
converged yet restored, it resides in *Zhōngnǚ Lí* (中女离, Middle Female);
closed yet compliant, it resides in *Zhǎngnǚ Xùn* (长女巽, Elder Female).

Thus, in man’s birth, *Tàipíng* (泰平, Great Harmony) is within him;
in man’s death, *Pǐ* (否, Blockage) is within him.
Ears that do not hear, Heaven’s black essence is within them;
eyes that do not see, Heaven’s azure essence is within them;
nose that does not smell, Heaven’s white essence is within it;
mouth that does not speak, Heaven’s crimson essence is within it;
yin that does not move, Earthly essence is within it;
yang that does not disperse, Heavenly essence is within it.»

The numinous and illuminated, the lofty paths of Heaven are thus unobstructed;
silent yet perfected, all undertakings of the world are fulfilled.

The divine essence of the East is the bones and sinews;
the divine essence of the South is the breath and *qi*;
the divine essence of the West is the meridians and vessels;
the divine essence of the North is the blood and vessels;
the divine essence of the Center is the flesh and muscles.

*Jiǎo Gāng* (角亢) shines as the light of the Azure Dragon;
*Dǒu Niú* (斗牛) shines as the light of the Dark Tortoise;
*Kuí Lóu* (奎娄) shines as the light of the White Tiger;
*Jǐng Guǐ* (井鬼) shines as the light of the Vermilion Bird.

*Fáng* (房) is the central palace of the Wood Star;
*Xū* (虚) is the central palace of the Water Star;
*Shù* (壮) is the central palace of the Metal Star;
*Xīng* (星) is the central palace of the Fire Star.

The teeth and jaws are the remnants of the Azure Dragon;
the claws and nails are the remnants of the White Tiger;
the hair and fur are the remnants of the Dark Tortoise;
the breath is the remnant of the Vermilion Bird.

Sound is the remnant of Heaven;
shadow is the remnant of Earth.

*Qián* (乾) stands majestic before all—it embodies the *One*;
*Kūn* (坤) blends harmoniously before all—it embraces the *One*.

The Five Thieves are the plunderers of these;
the Three Fields are the cultivators of these.

The cultivation of *zhī* (芝, reishi mushrooms) arises from *yángxū* (阳虚, the void of yang);
The cultivation of *yù* (玉, jade) arises from *yángxiù* (阳秀, the refined yang).

Medicinal efficacy is perfected within;
Divine communication manifests without.

Accumulated *yīn* (阴) scatters the minor;
Accumulated *yáng* (阳) reaches the supreme.

To move Heaven and Earth, to awaken spirits and gods—none excel the *yuánjīng* (元精, primordial essence);
To traverse water and fire, to pierce metal and stone—none surpass *zhìlǐ* (至理, ultimate principle);
To bless ten thousand peoples, to prolong the Nine Regions—none surpass *zhēnqì* (真气, true *qi*);
To refine the Five Spirits, to establish the Four Extremes—none precede *shényòng* (神用, spiritual application).

What fortifies the hundred bones? None surpass *zhēnjīn* (真金, true gold);
What strengthens the hundred sinews? None surpass *zhēnmù* (真木, true wood);
What circulates the hundred vessels? None excel *zhēnshuǐ* (真水, true water);
What elevates the hundred spirits? None overcome *zhēnhuǒ* (真火, true fire);
What fills the hundred joints? None rival *zhēntǔ* (真土, true earth).

How does one preserve the body? By avoiding labor.
How does one preserve life? By avoiding desire.
How does one cultivate nature? By avoiding thought.
How does one govern the spirit? By avoiding deceit.

Thus, the True Person abounds in *yáng* yet lacks *yīn*;
The common person abounds in *yīn* yet lacks *yáng*.
It is not that they lack *yīn*—rather, *yīn* transforms and returns to pure *yáng*;
It is not that they lack *yáng*—rather, *yáng* transforms and returns to pure *yīn*.
Pure *yáng* is the *qi* of the Immortal;
Pure *yīn* is the *qi* of the Ghost.
When the Immortal’s essence is perfected, it dwells in the realm of *yáng*;
When the Ghost’s essence is complete, it dwells in the realm of *yīn*.

Thus, the Immortal has no shadow at noon, no boundary in snow,
Crosses water without drowning, enters fire without burning,
Walks the void without falling, penetrates mountains unseen,
Is unharmed by blades, unaffected by poisons—
Ten thousand demons tremble, ten thousand spirits follow:
For they draw upon the *qi* of pure *yáng*.

The common person, when walking, is sluggish and clogged;
When stationary, is obstructed and congested;
A thousand worries gather, a thousand ailments fester;
Above, distant from the Celestial Gate; below, near the Earthly Door;
Encountering light, they awaken; seeing darkness, they dim;
Wisdom does not flow, desires do not cease;
Exhausted, they forget to return—thus they pass away:
For they draw upon the *qi* of pure *yīn*.

The white lungs correspond above to *Tàibái* (太白, Venus);
The red heart corresponds above to *Yínghuò* (荧惑, Mars);
The green liver corresponds above to *Suìxīng* (岁星, Jupiter);
The yellow spleen corresponds above to *Zhènxīng* (镇星, Saturn);
The black kidneys correspond above to *Chénxīng* (辰星, Mercury).

The *Huángdào* (黄道, ecliptic) corresponds above to the *Tàiyáng* (太阳, Sun);
The *Báidào* (白道, moon’s path) corresponds above to the *Tàiyǐn* (太阴, Moon).
Day governs life, corresponding above to *Nánchēn* (南辰, Southern Asterism);
Night governs death, corresponding above to *Běichēn* (北辰, Northern Asterism).
Thus, the Sage refines human affairs below and aligns with Heaven’s will above.

To listen to extremes brings deafness;
To gaze to extremes brings blindness;
To sniff to extremes brings obstruction;
To speak to extremes brings dimness;
To exhaust flow brings depletion;
To drain dissipation brings termination.
This is why one abandons the Six Extremes for the Five Blessings.

To speak of supreme hearing is to hear within;
To speak of supreme clarity is to see within;
To speak of true *qi* is to nurture within;
To speak of ultimate sound is to circulate within;
To speak of *yángjīng* (阳精, yang essence) is to refine within;
To speak of *yīnzhì* (阴滓, yin dregs) is to purge within.

The most robust in the world is the *hǔ* (虎, tiger);
The most compliant in the world is the *lóng* (龙, dragon);
The most divine in the world is the *dàyào* (大药, Great Elixir).

The Nine Saints illuminate externally—the *Bāguà* (八卦, Eight Trigrams);
The Nine Orifices illuminate internally—the *Bāguà*.
To cultivate them is to achieve longevity and clear vision.

**太清养生上篇**
**太清养生下篇**
*Dàochu* (道枢, *Dao* Pivot) Volume Twenty-Six

The ultimate seeker, **Zeng Kuo** (曾慥), compiled the *Rìyuè Xuánshū* (日月玄枢, *Mystic Pivot of Sun and Moon*), stating:

*"Heaven and Earth as the Cauldron;
Yin still, Yang in motion;
Following **Bo Yang** (伯阳), to illuminate lead and mercury."*

**Master Liu Zi** (刘子唐), a contemporary of Emperor Xuanzong (明皇时人), **Liu Zhigū** (刘知古), who served as Magistrate of **Changming County, Mianzhou** (绵州昌明县令), said:

*"The most concealed aspect of the Dao is the **Returning Elixir** (还丹);
The most verifiable aspect of the Returning Elixir is **Dragon-Tiger** (龙虎).
The origin of Dragon-Tiger is none other than the *Cāntóng Qì* (参同契).
**Bàopǔzi** (抱朴子) said:
*Wei Boyang* (魏伯阳) composed the *Cāntóng Qì* and *Wǔ Xiānglèi* (五相类), totaling two treatises, employing the *Yì* (大易, *Great Change*) hexagrams to expound the principles of elixir cultivation.*

**Master Xuánguāng** (玄光先生) said:
*The official Xu (徐从事) modeled the *Dragon-Tiger Celestial Diagram* (龙虎天文) and composed the *Cāntóng Qì* upper chapter, transmitting it to **Wei Jun** (魏君);
**Wei Jun** composed the middle chapter, transmitting it to **Chunyu Shutong** (淳于叔通);
**Chunyu Shutong** composed the lower chapter, thus manifesting the **Three Talents** (三才) Dao.

The *Cāntóng Qì* refers to **harmonizing the Three Talents** (参考三才), taking their **correspondences** (符契) as its essence.
I shall outline its key principles.

Its core states: *"The foundation lies in **Heaven and Earth** (乾坤为..."*

The tripod is established, and thus the **Dao of Heaven and Earth** is complete;
The **Kàn-Lí** (坎离) form the elixir, and the **southern and northern positions** are divided;
The **Dragon-Tiger** are their names, and the **western boundaries** are set.

When discussing **fire control** and determining **birth and transformation**, all follow the **hexagram cycles** as measured by the **lunar phases and musical pitches**.

Thus, when the **Huángzhōng (黄钟)** qi arrives, **yang** is born at **Fù (复)**, progressing through **Pǐ (否)** and **Tài (泰)**—when it reaches **Wèi (巳)**, the count of **yang** lines concludes.
When the **Gēngbīn (羹宾)** qi arrives, **yin** is born at **Shēn (娠)**, progressing through **Dùn (遁)** and **Bō (剥)**—when it reaches **Hài (亥)**, the count of **yin** lines concludes.
Thus, **termination and renewal**—this is the principle of the **Six Extremes (六合)**, **Three Talents (三才)**, **Four Seasons (四时)**, and **Five Phases (五行)**. The **tripod and elixir** are one in essence.

Some say:
The **liver’s green** is the father—**once-fired verdigris (曾青)** is this;
The **lung’s white** is the mother—**lead and silver (铅银)** are this;
The **kidney’s black** is the child—**black magnetite (玄磁)** is this;
The **spleen’s yellow** is the ancestor—**male and female (雄雌)** are this.
When **returned cinnabar** turns white and red into **purple-red**, it is the **once-fired male (曾雄)** qi staining it.

Those who do not know of **returned cinnabar**—the transformations of **yin-yang qi** follow **Heaven and Earth’s** birth and transformation, uniting the **metals and water’s** natural essence.
Does not the *Classic* say:
*"Uproot and discard the five stones of Wǔdū (武都), where is the alchemy of metals and stones?"*
My discussion of **elixir** is of the **Dragon-Tiger**—**flowing pearls** are the **Green Dragon**.
The **Green Dragon** is the **sun**; **yellow sprouts** are the **White Tiger**.
The **White Tiger** is the **moon**.
Thus, the **refined essences of sun and moon** contain principles of transformation—those who ingest them may also transform.
What is meant by **transformation**?
**Cinnabar (丹砂)** transforms into **mercury (水银)**, returning from **yang to yin**;
**Mercury** reverts to **cinnabar**, returning from **yin to yang**.
Thus, the **flowing pearl** is the **Great Green Elixir**.
**Black lead (黑铅)** transforms into **yellow elixir (黄丹)**, returning from **yin to yang**;
**Yellow elixir** reverts to **black lead**, returning from **yang to yin**.
These two substances—if called **yin**, they suddenly become **yang**;
If called **yang**, they suddenly become **yin**.

「They become husband and wife to each other, then interchange as parents—
this is the spontaneous interplay of **yin** and **yang** that even sages cannot fully fathom.

The **Wei** Lady said:
*"The **ling** of **Lingya** (灵芽), when the **Dragon** descends from the **Fangquan** (方泉),
the **Jingyun** (景云) and **Xiaojiang** (霄降) follow in kind;
when the **Tiger** roars into the **void (虚无)**,
the **Chongfeng** (冲风) shakes the four quarters in response.
The **yang mirror (阳燧)** reflects brilliance, yet **crimson flames (朱火)** smolder within;
when **Fangzhu** (方诸) encounters **yin**, the **dark currents (玄流)** overflow—
all these are the natural workings of their own kind.

In the ancient times, there was **mercury (水银)** yet it could not alone form the **Great Elixir (大丹)**—why?
Because there was **Dragon** without **Tiger**.

If one does not grasp this,
what need is there for the **Four Symbols (四象)** or **Five Phases (五行)**,
what use are the **yin-yang male-female (阴阳男女)** correspondences?
This is the **Way (道)** that moves without reliance on external substances,
nor upon human intervention—it simply follows the **Great Dao (大道)** and transforms of its own accord.

As for the **Eight Precious Stones (纪纲八石)**,
they originate from these two substances;
the **unity of Dragon and Tiger (龙虎一体)** opens into the **Three Refined Paths (三条)**.

Yet those who attempt this often fail—why?
Because they do not comprehend the **principle of Three and Five as One (三五一者)**.

Zhuangzi said:
*"To know the One (一), all matters are complete—
is this not what he meant?*

As for **Returning to the Cinnabar (还丹)**,
how does it transcend the world?
It feeds upon the **refined essences of sun and moon (日月之精华)**.

What are the **sun and moon (日月)**?
The **Heaven-born Dark Lady (玄女)** and the **Earth-born Yellow Male (黄男)**, are they not?

The **Dragon** and **Tiger (龙虎)** are **gold (金)** and **mercury (汞)**.
When **gold** and **mercury (汞)** mutually envelop each other,
they attain the **nature of spontaneity (自然之性)**—
is this not their **divine essence (神)**?

The *Huangting Jing* (《黄庭经》) states:
*"The **refined essences of sun and moon (日月之精)** preserve the aged and restore the decrepit—
it refers to the **Two Jingyuns (二景)** and **Two Yues (二月)**."*

Master Liu (刘子) said:
*"To bow to the **Two Jingyuns’ (二景) radiance** and ingest the **Five Xias’ (五晨) mists**,
many followers there are, yet few attain transcendence and longevity—why?
The key to **longevity (长生)** lies in **nurturing and refining (保养服食)**,
drawing from both **internal and external (内外)** sources—
not by relying solely on one aspect alone,
can one then hope to succeed?"*

Some say: *"Use **black lead (铅)**,"* others say: *"Do not use **black lead (铅)**—*
which is correct?"

Master Liu (刘子) replied:
*"From the **Upper Scripture (上经)**, it is said:
*'The **True Person (真人)** is most subtle,
as if present yet absent;
like the **Great Elixir (大泉)**, sometimes deep, sometimes floating.*
From the **Middle Scripture (中经)**, it is said:
*'The **True Person (真人)** dwells in the hidden depths,
guarding the **middle rule (中规)** with sinking and rising.*
What is meant by this?"*

The **lead** is transmuted into **mercury (quicksilver)**, and the mercury is warmed before being introduced—
at first, its entry is silent, without sound.

When the fire grows fierce, the **flower** floats, standing apart and distinct—
is this not the **lead** dwelling in the depths of the **Great Elixir’s** abyss?

If one says this **lead** is not **lead**, who can truly know?

Some claim that the **crucible** contains **earth**—this is mere delusion.
The true **lead** is the **Great Lead**.

**Water** occupies the **North**, its **hexagram** belonging to **Kàn (坎)**, and **Kàn** generates the **Six Wu (六戊)**.
The **Six Wu** are **earth**.

**Fire** occupies the **South**, its **hexagram** belonging to **Lí (离)**, and **Lí** generates the **Six Ji (六己)**.
The **Six Ji** are also **earth**.

Thus, **earth** is the **qi** of **Wu and Ji**, not the **earth** of the physical world.
This is the meaning of the **Kàn-Wu month’s essence** and the **Lí-Ji day’s light**.

Hence, one **yin** and one **yang** form **water and fire**.
**Fire** takes **water** as its **husband**; **water** takes **fire** as its **wife**.
The **Way of husband and wife** is that of **Wu and Ji**.

Therefore, all things begin and end in **earth**, and none escape the **virtue/power** of **water and fire**.

**Metal** generates **water**, **water** generates **metal**—
this is the **yellow sprout** born within the **lead**.

The **secret formula** states:
*"**Lead** can subdue **mercury**, **mercury** can suppress **metal**,
**metal and mercury** take form—this is the principle of **silver’s** concealment."*

**Wood** generates **fire**, **fire** generates **wood**—
this is the **cinnabar** emerging from within the **mercury**.

How does **mercury** become **wood**?
It receives the **qi of the Great Yang (太阳)**, transforming into flowing **pearls**.

The **Great Yang** is the **sun**, rising in the **束 (shù) direction**.
The **束 direction** is the **position of wood**.

As for **lead**, it becomes **metal**—why?
Because the **moon** is born in the **West**, and the **West** is the **position of metal**.

Thus, the **Returned Elixir** aligns with the **mysterious symbols**—
the **symbols of the sun and moon** must be at **new and full moon**,
gathering the **virtue/power and penalizing qi** in harmony with **Mao and You (卯酉)**,
entering and exiting **Heaven and Earth**, lingering between **Zǐ and Wǔ (子午)**,
taking **Heaven and Earth** as **male and female**, **yin and yang** as **parent and child**,
the **left as the Azure Dragon**, the **right as the White Tiger**.

As the **Scripture** says:
*"The sun’s essence flows as pearls, accompanied by the Azure Dragon—*
this is what is meant."

The shallow-minded of this world mix **mercury and mineral ores** in a vessel,
forging what they call **"nurturing the child."**
At first, the two substances intermingle,
but later, **lead and mercury** separate—
sometimes after a year, sometimes after three,
the **silver mother** yields to **red powder**.

Those who deeply conceal the **fire** retain four or five out of ten;
the shallow retain only two or three.

「Ingesting it only brings harm to life. They claim that **silver (yin)** is born from **lead (yang)**, that by refining **lead essence (精)** with **mercury (汞)**, it will naturally become the **Azure Dragon and White Tiger (龙虎)**—yet they fail to recognize that **yellow sprout (黄芽)** emerges from **lead (铅)**, though it is not **lead** itself. The **Scripture** states:
*"**Yellow sprout (黄芽)** is not **lead (铅)**,
yet it does not depart from within **lead** to form.
This is what is meant."*

Thus, the **Azure Dragon and White Tiger (龙虎)** must be refined with **yellow sprout (黄芽)** as their **true foundation (正)**.
Hence, the ancients said:
*"The ultimate and the beginning mutually employ one another,"*
meaning that **mercury (汞)** is cast into **lead (铅)**,
and like is united with like—
as a **father refines his son (父制子)**,
and a **son refines his grandson (子制孙)****.

The nature of **fire (火)** is to consume **metal (金)**,
while **metal (金)** subdues **wood (木)** in its three phases—
this is the completion of **elixir (还丹)**.

Some have heard the **Azure Dragon and White Tiger (龙虎)** hymns say:
*"**Yin (阴)** resides above,
**Yang (阳)** races below,
**Head and tail (首尾)** are martial,
**Central interplay (中问)** is cultural."*

Why is a cup of water often placed above the furnace?
For **elixir (还丹)** arises from **yang’s birth (阳生)**,
and is perfected when **yin reaches its peak (阴极)**.
**Yang (阳)** is concealed beneath,
**Yin (阴)** is concealed above—
when water is present,
it must await the **growth of metal (金)**,
the **time of the Water King (水王)**.

What does this mean?
From **self-complexion (自复)** to **observation (观)**,
passing through ten months,
when **lead and yellow sprout (铅黄)** are refined,
the **Dao of elixir (丹道)** nears completion—
the **child (子)** emerges from the **mother’s womb (母之胞)**,
no longer mingling within her.
**Yang (阳)** is consumed, **yin (阴)** subsides,
**metal (金)** flourishes while **water (水)** wanes—
**spirit and soul (魂魄)** find harmony,
**firmness and softness (刚柔)** unite as one—
then the **yin furnace (阴炉)** is set above,
and **flame (炎火)** is arrayed below,
so that *"water is raised to stir the fire,
and the radiance is extinguished in stillness."*

The **Scripture** says:
*"When water is abundant, it invades **Kàn (坎)** and suppresses **yang (阳)**;
when fire is weak, it departs and plunges into darkness.
**Yin and yang (阴阳)** nourish one another—
their interplay conforms to the **Dao (道)**, acting naturally.
Thus, they align with the seasons,
harmonizing with the **qi (气)**."*

The **True Person (真人)** then covers the **elixir (金丹)**,
allowing it to undergo **fire refinement (火化)**,
and to receive **yin moisture (阴津)** for nourishment—
this is indeed wondrous.

The shallow-minded of this world,
some mix **yellow sprout (黄芽)** and **ore flowers (黄花)** with **mercury (水银)**,
refining them into **purple powder (紫粉)**;
some combine **cinnabar (朱砂)**, **mercury (水银)**, **realgar (雄黄)**, **orpiment (雌黄)**, **malachite (曾青)**, **azurite (空青)**, **alum (矾石)**, and **mica (云母)**, then forge and subdue them;
some bind **various greens (诸青)**, **various alum (诸矾)**, **various verdants (诸绿)**, and **various ashes (诸灰)** with **mercury (水银)** to produce **red silver (红银)**, then further refine it into **powdered dross (粉屑)**;
some boil **medicinal herbs (药)** with **sulfur (硫黄)** to yield **jade powder (玉粉)**;
some refine **sulfur (硫黄)** with **copper leaves (染铜叶)** to make **crimson elixir (赤丹)**;
some transform **bismuth (毗霜)** into **copper (铜)**, using **iron (铁)** to condense **tin (锡)**—
these are not my methods.

Others say:
*"**Gold (金)**, **silver (银)**, **copper (铜)**, **iron (铁)**, **tin (锡)**—
these are the **five metals (五金)**;
**realgar (雄黄)**, **orpiment (雌黄)**, **bismuth (毗霜)**, **alum (矾)**, **gallstone (胆)**, **malachite (曾青)**, **azurite (空青)**, **barite (誉)**—
these are the **eight stones (八石)**."*

**Master Liú (刘子)** replies:
*"These are not what I refer to as **eight stones (八石)**.
**Zǐ and Wǔ (子午)** complete the **three (三)**,
**Wù and Jǐ (戊己)** establish the **five (五)**—
this is my naming of the **eight stones (八石)**."*

The **Scripture** says:
*"**Nine returns (九还)**, **seven transformations (七返)**, **eight cycles (八归)**, **six abidings (六居)**—
this is the **mysterious essence (玄旨)** of **elixir (还丹)**.
What does it mean?

**Metal’s (金)** birth number is **four (四)**,
yet its completion number is **nine (九)**;
**Wood’s (木)** birth number is **three (三)**,
yet its completion number is **eight (八)**;
**Fire’s (火)** birth number is **two (二)**,
yet its completion number is **seven (七)**.
These three refer to the **harmony of their original generating qi (本生之气)**.

It further says:
*"**Fire (火)** unites with **earth (土)**—
this is the **seven transformations (七返)**;
**Wood (木)** unites with **earth (土)**—
this is the **eight cycles (八归)**;
**Metal (金)** unites with **earth (土)**—
this is the **nine returns (九还)**.
**Water’s (水)** birth number is **one (一)**,
yet its completion number is **six (六)**.
**Metal (金)** generates **water (水)**,
yet **water (水)** cannot unite with **metal (金)**—
it remains fixed in itself,
thus called **six abidings (六居)**."*

It further says:
*"Does **water (水)** unite with **earth (土)**?
The **Heavenly Way (天道)** revolves to the left,
while the **sun and moon (日月)** move to the right—
when observed from below,
**metal (金)** generates **water (水)**,
and **wood (木)** generates **fire (火)**;
when observed from above,
**water (水)** generates **metal (金)**,
and **fire (火)** generates **wood (木)**.
The **Scripture** says:
*"The **child (子)** turns rightward,
the **White Tiger (虎)** revolves eastward,
**Zǐ and Wǔ (卯酉)** demarcate the boundary,
and determine the **two names (二名)**—
this is what is meant, is it not?"*

In the **"Nine True Jade Scriptures (九真玉书篇)"**:
*"Take the body as the **crucible (鼎)**,
and **qi (气)** as the **medicine (药)**;
pair with **yin and yang (阴阳)**,
and silently let them interact.
The **Pure Yang Son (纯阳子)** says:
*"Those refining **elixir (丹)** must first purify their **furnace (炉)**.
The **furnace (炉)** is the **outer wall of the crucible (鼎之外垣)**—
its body is this.

Within it lies the **medicine of longevity (长生之药)**—
**divine qi (神气)** and **essence-fluid (精液)** are these.
The **furnace (炉)** is divided into **eight gates (八门)**.

The **eight gates (八门)** are:
the **eyes (目)**, the **ears (耳)**, the **mouth (口)**, the **nose (鼻)**—
these are the **portals for sight (视)**, **hearing (听)**, **exhalation and inhalation (吐纳)**,
the **unopened keys (素钥)** of the **closed doors (辟阖之户)**.
Each is moved and regulated as appropriate—
constantly guarded and steadied,
so that **form and color (形色)**,
**taste and nourishment (滋味)**,
**eight perils (八邪)**,
and **six thieves (六贼)** do not harm the **inner True (内真)**.
Then, in the **Heavenly furnace (天地之炉)**,
within the **Crucible of Transformation (造化之鼎)**,
one adjusts and harmonizes the **medicinal substances (药物)**,
matches **yin and yang (阴阳)**,
and refines **divine qi (神气)**."*

**Heaven (天)** is **Kàn (乾)** and **Metal (金)**.
The **"Inner Landscape (内景)"** states:
*"The **Lung Palace (肺宫)**,
above is the **Flowery Canopy (华盖)**,
below covers all the **viscera (诸藏)**,
and connects through the **nose (鼻)**.
The **nose (鼻)** is the **Gate of Heaven (天门)**.
As **ascending and descending breaths (升降呼吸)** circulate,
**nourishment and defense (荣卫)** move and turn,
**the five viscera (五藏)** cycle and revolve,
**vital fluids (流注)** permeate the **body (一身)**,
with **movement and stillness (动变浮沉)****,
and **expansion and contraction (大小)**** having fixed measures—
like the **Heavenly motion of stars and constellations (天运星斗)**,
and the **Earthly rotation of rivers and seas (地转江河)**.
Thus, **Heaven (天)** is the **crucible (鼎)**.
The **Gate of Heaven (天门)** links with the **Lung (肺)**,
as **breaths (出入)** of **pure qi (清气)** serve as the **crucible’s cover (鼎之盖)**."*

**Earth (地)** is **Kūn (坤)** and **Soil (土)**.
The **"Inner Landscape (内景)"** states:
*"The **Spleen (脾)** encompasses **water and grain (水谷)**,
and connects with the **Heart (心)**.
The **Heart (心)** is the **Earthly Portal (地户)****,
the **Throat Gate (咽门)**.
It receives and stores **water and grain (水谷)**,
descending to rest within the **Stomach Courtyard (胃院)**.
Its circulating **fluids (流转之水)** internally resonate with the **blood vessels (血脉)**.
Thus, the **Spleen (脾)** receives the **ascending and descending breaths (天门升降之气)**,
moving and shaking in transformation,
grinding and refining **Creation (造化)**,
to separate the **pure and turbid (清浊)** of **water and grain (水谷)**.
The **pure (清)** ascends to the **upper burner (上焦)****,
the **Lung Palace (肺宫)**—
the realm of **serenity and purity (清静之界)**—
and becomes **divine qi (神气)** and **essence-fluid (精液)**."*

The **turbid (浊)** descends and drains into the **Great and Small Palaces (大小府)**.
Thus, the **Earth (地)** is the **reverberating qi (复气)** of the **cauldron (鼎)**,
the agent of **transformation (变化)** for all things.
The **Stomach (胃)** is the **cauldron (鼎)** of **Creation (造化)**.
The **Sun (日)** is the **celestial spirit (天魂)**,
the **fire-essence (火精)** of the **Great Yang (太阳)**.
Its station resides in **Heavenly Stem (乾)** and **Earthly Branch (艮)**,
where it reigns in summer and wanes in winter,
with nights short and days long.
It internally harbors **yin-qi (阴气)**,
while concealing the **Golden Crow (金鹦)**.
The **Golden Crow (金鹦)**—**You (酉)**—
corresponds externally to the **four directions (四方)**.
For it is the **metal and stone (金石)** that can generate its **water (水)**.
Thus, **Heavenly Stem (乾)** is **Celestial Metal (天金)**,
and **Earthly Branch (艮)** is **Water Stone (水石)**,
so **water (水)** is born within the **mountain stones (山石)**.
This is **yang within yin (阳中有阴)**.

The *Inner Vision (内景)* says:
The **upper burner (上焦)** is **Heaven (天)**,
the **Heart (心)** is the **Spirit Palace (灵府)**,
the **head (首)** is the **Earthly Branch Mountain (艮山)**,
and the **mouth (口)** is the **Cavernous Valley (洞谷)**—
the **source (源)** of **water (水)**.
**Water (水)** is **Earthly Branch (坤)** and **Earth (地)**.
The **accumulated yin-qi (积阴之气)**,
ascending to the **upper heavens (上天)**,
soaring above the **Celestial Canopy (华盖)**.
Its dispersion becomes **rain and dew (雨露)**,
soaking and nourishing the **Heart (心)**—
**yin within yang (阳中之阴)**.

**Li (离)** is **external yang (外阳)** and **internal yin (内阴)**,
like **cinnabar (丹砂)**.
Its root belongs to **fire (火)**,
yet within it hides **mercury (水银)**.
The **Great Yin (太阴)** is the **spirit (魂)** of **Xie (诧)**,
wearing the **five-colored robes (五彩之衣)**.
**Li (离)** is **radiance (丽)**.
Its **essence (精)** is the **Sun (日)**,
which bears **five colors (五彩)**.
Within it is the **Vermilion Palace (绛官)**,
communicating upward with the **eyes (目)**.
The **eyes (目)** are the **gate (门)** of the **Marrow Ball (泥丸)**.
Its **palace (宫)** holds a **divine entity (神)**—
the **master (主)** of **Heaven and Earth (天地)**—
whose **virtue/power (德)** aligns with **wuwei (无为)**.
Those who **cultivate life (修命)** must first **clarify their spirit (澄其神)**;
when the **spirit is clear (神清)** and the **Heart is rectified (心正)**,
then **evil does not arise (邪不性)**.
If the **Heart cannot contain itself (心不能自伏)**,
then **deceitful fire (奸火)** internally generates—
like **cinnabar (丹砂)** that does not perish,
and upon seeing **fire (火)** flies.

Thus, the **Heart (心)** is the **master of life (生命之主)**!

The **Moon (月)** is the **earthly soul (地魄)**,
the **water-essence (水精)** of the **Great Yin (太阴)**.
Its station belongs to **Earthly Branch (坤)** and **Perseverance (巽)**,
where it reigns in winter and wanes in summer,
with days short and nights long.
It internally conceals **yang-essence (阳精)**,
while harboring the **Jade Hare (玉兔)**.
The **Jade Hare (玉兔)**—**Mao (卯)**—
is the **wood (木)** of the **four directions (束方)**,
capable of generating its **fire (火)**.
This is **yang within yin (阴中有阳)**.

The *Inner Vision (内景)* says:
The **five viscera (五藏)** of the **lower burner (下焦)** are the **two kidneys (二肾)**.
The **two kidneys (二肾)** at the center are the **Elixir Field (丹田)**.
Before them lies the **Perseverance Sea (巽海)**—
the **human Water Palace (水府)**—
whose station is at **Yin (寅)**.
This is **yang concealed within yin (阴中含阳)**.

**Kan (坎)** is **abyss (陷)**,
the **palace (府)** that receives **water (水)**,
so the **rivers and lakes (江湖)** return to **Perseverance (巽)**.
The world does not know the **true positions (正位)** of **yin and yang (阴阳)**,
mistaking the **north (北)** for **Kan (坎)** and the **south (南)** for **Li (离)**—
this is incorrect.
**Kan (坎)** is the **south (南)**, the station of **Earthly Branch (坤)** and **Perseverance (巽)**.
The **odd yang (奇阳)** within **Kan (坎)** is the **fire (火)** of the **south (南)**, at **Si (巳)** and **Wu (午)**.
**Li (离)** is the **north (北)**, the station of **Heavenly Stem (乾)** and **Earthly Branch (艮)**.
The **paired yin (偶阴)** within **Li (离)** is the **water (水)** of the **north (北)**, at **Hai (亥)** and **Zi (子)**.

**Kan (坎)** is **internal yang (内阳)** and **external yin (外阴)**,
like **lead and tin (铅锡)**.
This is **yang produced within white silver (白银)**,
and **water of stones (砂石之水)** enveloping **red gold (赤金)**.
**Gold and silver (金银)** are both **yang within yin (阴中之阳)**.
This is the **baby (婴儿)**,
which, with the **Great Yin (太阴)** old woman of **Li (离)**,
unites as **husband and wife (夫妇)**—
emotions and affinities converging—
to congeal and form **sand (砂)**.

Thus, **Kan (坎)** is the **palace (宫)** of the **hidden dragon within the water sea (水海隐龙)**!
Its **venerable status (尊)** is like that of an **emperor (帝王)**
residing at the **northern gate (北阙)**,
yet facing the **south (南)**.

The **Moon (月)** is **Earth (地)**;
without **yang (阳)**, all things would not be born.
All things, **receiving (禀)** from **Heaven and Earth (天地)**,
grow toward the **yang (阳)**.
How much more so for **humans (人)**—
the **most refined (灵)** of all things—
should they not **conform to Heaven and Earth (顺天地)**?

To **conform to the Dao of Heaven (顺天道)**,
one must **preserve the primordial yang (元阳)** of their body,
the **True One (真一)** of **Great Harmony (太和)**,
the **pure and unadulterated qi (纯粹之气)**,
then **long life (长生)** is achieved through stillness.
Yet, it must be **cultivated day and night (昼夜修炼)**.
**Inner cultivation (内功)** is **one day (一日)**;
**Heavenly cycles (天运)** are **one year (一岁)**.
The **ascending and descending (升降)** of **yin and yang (阴阳)**,
the **circulation (运行)** of the **four seasons (四序)**,
completes **twelve cycles (十有二时)**.
By **day (昼)**, one follows the **laws of spring and summer (法春夏)**;
by **night (夜)**, one follows the **laws of autumn and winter (法秋冬)**.
The **cessation and renewal (终始)** of **day and night (昼夜)**,
the **interchange of Heaven and Earth (天地交泰)**.

The **times of Hai (亥), Zi (子), Chou (丑)** correspond to **Heaven’s winter (天之冬)**.
**Yin-qi (阴)** ascends to the **Heavenly Heart (天心)**,
**yang-qi (阳)** descends to the **Water Palace (水府)**,
**nourishing warmth (温养)** in the **kidneys (肾)**,
**transmutation (变炼)** in the **bones (骨)**—
also like **mountain stones (山石)** receiving the **ascending and descending breaths (升降之气)** of **Heaven and Earth (天地)**,
transforming into **gold and silver, cinnabar, and copper-iron (金银、丹砂、铜铁)**.

The **times of Yin (寅), Mao (卯), Chen (辰)** correspond to **Heaven’s spring (天之春)**.
**Yin-qi (阴)** descends to the **Celestial Canopy (华盖)**,
**yang-qi (阳)** ascends above the **cauldron (鼎)**,
**nourishing warmth (温养)** in the **Liver (肝)**,
**generating (生成)** in the **sinews and vessels (筋脉)**—
also like **Heaven and Earth’s grasses and trees (天地草木)** receiving the **harmonious yang-qi (阳和之气)**,
to produce **blossoms, leaves, and sprouts (华叶苗蔓)**.

The **times of Si (巳), Wu (午), Wei (未)** correspond to **Heaven’s summer (天之夏)**.
**Yin-qi (阴)** descends to the **Water Palace (水府)**,
**yang-qi (阳)** reaches its peak in the **Fire Palace (火宫)**,
**nourishing warmth (温养)** in the **Heart (心)**,
**transmutation (变成)** in the **blood vessels (血脉)**—
the **true yang (真阳)** refining into **white milk (白乳)**.

The **times of Shen (申), You (酉), Xu (戌)** correspond to **Heaven’s autumn (天之秋)**.
**Yang-qi (阳)** reaches its peak and descends to **Earth (地)**,
**yin-qi (阴)** returns and ascends to **Heaven (天)**,
**nourishing warmth (温养)** in the **Lungs (肺)**,
**transformation (变换)** in the **skin (皮肤)**.

Thus, **day and night (昼夜)** respond to the **four seasons (四时)**,
and **yin and yang (阴阳)** guard the **unity of the body (一体)**.
This is the **way to attain sainthood (入圣之道)**.

The *Inner Vision (内景)* says:
The **body (身)** is a **state (国)**,
the **face (面)** is a **city (城)**,
the **ears (耳), eyes (目), mouth (口), and nose (鼻)** are **gates (门)**,
the **hands and feet, four limbs (手足、四肢)** are the **four-directional generals (四方之将)**,
to **defend against unforeseen threats (防国之不虞)**.

The **sovereign (君)** of the **state (国)** is the **Heart (心)**;
the **ministers (臣)** are the **qi (气)** and the **kidneys (肾)**.
Thus, the **Heart (心)** is the **master of qi (气主)**,
and **qi (气)** is the **spirit of the Heart (心神)**.
When **clarified and tranquil (澄静)**, it becomes **harmonious and peaceful (和宁)**—
like the **symbol of great peace (太平之象)**.
When **spirit-qi (神气)** is **harmoniously unified (和合)**,
then **longevity and lasting vision (长生久视)** are achieved.

The **sovereign (君)** is the **pure primordial yang (纯元真一)** of the **Vermilion Palace (绛官)**;
the **minister (臣)** is the **Great Yin (太阴)** and **profound darkness (玄冥)** of the **Kan Palace (坎宫)**.
**Heaven (天)** descends **true qi (真气)**,
transforming and giving birth to all things—
like the **minister (臣)** receiving **favor (恩)**.
**Earth (地)** ascends **yin-qi (阴气)**,
congealing into **rain and dew (雨露)**,
to **nourish and benefit all things (滋润万物)**—
like the **minister (臣)** benefiting the **people (利民)**.

The **Heart (心)** connects beneath the **tongue (舌)**,
where there is a **Jade Pool (玉池)**.

Left is called **Jin Jing** (金精, "metallic essence"), right is called **Yu Ye** (玉液, "jade fluid"), both originating from the **Kan Palace** (坎宫).

When **qi** ascends above, it transforms into **rain, dew, springs, and ravines** (雨露泉涧), moistening the **Heart**—then the **Heart** becomes vital. This is how the **minister benefits the state**.

The **kidneys** are the **pure primordial yin, true unity, and great harmony palace** (纯阴真一太和之宫), their **qi** originally generated from the **Li position** (离位).

Descending **qi** below, it warms and nourishes the **Dan Tian** (丹田)—the central region between the two kidneys, called the **Dan Field** (丹田焉).

The **Sovereign’s** wisdom—governing the body is like governing a household!

The **body** is the **residence** (宅);
the **Five Viscera** are the **palaces** (宫).

**Qian Heaven** (乾天) is the **father**; **Kun Earth** (坤地) is the **mother**.
**Kan** is the **middle son**; **Li** is the **middle daughter**.
**Zhen** is the **eldest son**; **Xun** is the **eldest daughter**.
**Gen** is the **youngest son**; **Dui** is the **youngest daughter**.

The **three sons and three daughters** pair as **husband and wife**;
**Qian Father** and **Kun Mother** form the **matched pair**.

The **East Palace** is the **liver** (肝), **Wood** (木).
**Jia** is the elder brother, **Yi** the younger sister;
**Ji** is **Jia’s wife**, **Geng** is **Yi’s husband**—thus the **liver**, receiving **water**, sinks, and **Wood** carries **metal qi**.

The **West Palace** is the **lung** (肺), **Metal** (金).
**Geng** is the elder brother, **Xin** the younger sister;
**Yi** is **Geng’s wife**, **Bing** is **Xin’s husband**—thus the **lung**, receiving **water**, floats, and **Metal** carries **Wood qi**.

The **South Palace** is the **Heart** (心), **Fire** (火).
**Bing** is the elder brother, **Ding** the younger sister;
**Xin** is **Bing’s wife**, **Ren** is **Ding’s husband**—thus the **Heart** can **resist fire**.

The **North Palace** is the **kidneys** (肾), **Water** (水).
**Ren** is the elder brother, **Gui** the younger sister;
**Ding** is **Ren’s wife**, **Wu** is **Gui’s husband**—thus the **kidneys** are the **fire qi**.

The **Central Palace** is the **spleen** (脾), **Earth** (土).
**Wu** is the elder brother, **Ji** the younger sister;
**Gui** is **Wu’s wife**, **Jia** is **Ji’s husband**—thus the **spleen** can **receive grains**, and **Earth** carries **water qi**.

This is called the **"Cauldron of Creation"** (造化之鼎)!

The **true form** is the **furnace’s** central **Heaven and Earth**, **sun and moon**, **stars and constellations**, **Milky Way**, **mountains and seas**, **plants and clouds**—
the **furnace** is **my body**.

**Heaven** is **Qian** (乾), **Metal** (金).
The **flowery canopy** is then its **lungs**.
**Dark symbols, stars, and constellations**, the **celestial wheel**, **sun and moon**—these are the **upper burner’s** pathways of **honoring and protective qi** (荣卫血气) flowing through.

**Tai Qing’s** (太清) **play of pure and impure** above and below is the **middle burner’s** **diaphragm** (罗膈).
**Five peaks and mountains** are its **head and face**.
**Ravines and valleys** are its **mouth and nostrils**.
**Springs and sources** are its **saliva and fluids, food and drink**.
**Rivers and seas converging into the great ocean** are its **food gathering in the Water and Grain Storehouse** (水谷之府).
**Clouds and rain born in mountain valleys** are its **breathing qi**—
**exhaled as wind**, **inhaled as clouds**.

**Grasses and trees** are its **hair and fur**.
**Heaven and Earth’s longevity** comes from **upholding the true unity of primordial qi** (正一真元之道).
Within **my furnace-cauldron of Heaven and Earth**, **yin and yang** unite without losing **primordial qi**, achieving **naturalness**—thus **longevity** is attained.

How so?
Humans receive **Heaven and Earth’s essence** at birth—within them lies the **path of Heaven and Earth’s longevity**.
If one **internally perceives Heaven and Earth**, unites **yin and yang**, and **nurtures spirit-qi**,
when **essence and fluid** (精液) are **full as sun and moon**,
how could one **not** achieve **longevity**?

Its essence lies in **refining the Five Phases** (五行).
The **Five Phases** are the **Five Viscera**.
Using the **Wu-Ji cauldron** (戊己鼎鼎) as the vessel,
**harmonizing the Four Symbols** (四象) to **transform the Five Phases**:
**Water** is **fluid** (液).
Within **fluid** is **Metal**—called **Metal Fluid** (金液).
**Metal overcomes Wood**, **Wood generates Fire**, **Fire refines Metal**—
the **Four Symbols** return in cycle, all governed by **Earth**—this is **spirit** (神).
**Spirit** finds its **Way**, ascending as **Immortal**;
**losing its Way**, it sinks as **ghost**.

The practitioner of **True Reality** (修真者) should **abandon worldly excess** (去繁华), **sever attachments** (绝嗜欲), and **exclude pungent and greasy** (屏腥膻);
**clearing the present and dispelling distractions** (清今消遥), **maintaining strict purity in diet and observances** (洁严斋戒), **ascending the platform and entering the chamber** (登坛入室), **selecting auspicious days and waiting for the right moment** (择日俟时)—
**facing the sun and turning away from the shade** (背阴向阳), **closing the eyes and sitting still** (闭目而坐),
**grasping and consolidating with a tranquil mind** (握固冥心), **opening the furnace’s door** (开辟炉门),
**to regulate and refine the Five Phases** (以运火候, 修炼其五藏焉).
Its **work** (功) must **pass through the Nine Transformations** (九转).
The **fourth month** (四月) is the **third transformation** (三转);
**one cycle** (一周) is the **ninth transformation** (九转);
**three years** (三年) and the **elixir is complete** (丹成).

Its **great central measure** (大方寸) weighs **one jin** (一斤),
**half yin and half yang** (阴阳各半).
**Externally corresponding** (外应) to the **64 Hexagrams** (六十四卦) where the **lines weigh one jin** (爻一斤),
there are **384 liang** (三百八十四铢).
The **64 Hexagrams** (六十四卦) contain **384 lines** (三百八十四爻),
the **grandest numbers of yin and yang** (阴阳之大数).

**Dao/Way’s Pivot** (道枢) Volume **26** concludes: #1**Pi** (否) and **Tai** (泰) – in the **essential compilation** (辑要), it reads *"Lin* (临) and *Fu* (夫)".* #2**Yin** (银) – in the **essential compilation**, it reads *"Qian* (铅)."* #3**Mo** (磨) – originally *"Mo* (魔),"* corrected according to the **essential compilation**. #4**Jin** (浸) – in the **essential compilation**, it reads *"Qin* (侵)."* #5**Wood** (木) – originally *"Water* (水),"* corrected according to the **essential compilation**.

Volume **27** of **Dao/Way’s Pivot**: *Great Clarity Nurturing Life* (太清养生) Upper Section (上篇), Lower Section (下篇).

「Thus, the **Master of Wanderings**, **Zeng Tao** (曾慥), compiled the *Golden Elixir of the Dragon and Tiger* (金液龙虎篇), skillfully crafting **cinnabar** (丹砂) to preserve life and safeguard one’s family; nurturing the **Incredulous Maiden** (诧女) with **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽) as her consort. The **Lord of the Golden Elixir**, **Zhang Zhongfu** (张中孚, *Encountered by Master Xiang* 遇天真子), served as an official in the **Gold Department** (金部郎) until retirement. In **Regling 7** (庆历七年), I met him in **Liyang** (历阳) and obtained the **Dragon and Tiger Method** (龙虎之诀).

He said: The **seven dozen names of the Golden Elixir** (金丹七十二名) are all achieved through the **harmony of Three and Five** (三五一). Since the Five Emperors (五帝), up to the **first year of Regling** (庆历之元) in our **Song Dynasty** (宋), those who ascended to immortality numbered **over sixty thousand** (六万余人), none of whom failed to refine **Divine Water** (神水) from the **Flower Pool** (华池). This elixir originates from the **Five Phases** (五行) and returns to **emptiness** (虚无), revealing that **Divine Water** (神水) is the **original qi** (元气) of the **Three Realms** (三才: 天地人) and the **true essence** (真精) of the Five Phases. Within the **three elixir fields** (三丹田), it circulates above and below, becoming **Returning Elixir** (还丹). Its medicine consists of **five flavors** (五味): as **Zhang Zhongfu** (张中孚) said, quoting **Excorpator Bian** (扁鹊): *"Sour, salty, pungent, sweet, and bitter—these are the **River Vehicle** (河车) and others."* Refining them with **fire alchemy** (火候) yields the **Great Elixir** (大丹). **Divine Water** (神水) is both **lead** (铅) and **mercury** (汞), yet must be refined within **lead** (铅). This is the **lead-mercury** (铅汞) essence.

The **names of the Great Medicine** (大药之名) total **twenty-four** (二十有四): **Divine Water** (神水), **Yao Ming Essence** (杳冥精), **Returning Elixir** (还丹), **True Unity** (真一), **Gold within Water** (水中金), **Black Lead** (黑铅), **River Vehicle** (河车), **Five Colors** (五彩), **Five Flavors** (五味), **Kan Male** (坎男), **True Mercury** (真汞), **White Gold** (白金), **White Tiger** (白虎), **Golden Essence** (金精), **Five Constants** (五常), **Earth Medicine** (地药), **White Earth Spirit** (白地魄), **Soul** (魂), **Moon Blossom** (月花), **Lead Yellow Blossom** (铅黄花), **Jade Flower** (玉华), **Water Tiger** (水虎), **Jade Toad** (玉蟾), and **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽). These **twenty-four qi** (二十四气) are the **hidden mysteries of the Dao’s profound gate** (隐奥之玄关).

The song says:
*Who crafts the cinnabar?*
*It rescues life and secures the family,*
*Nurtures the Incredulous Maiden,*
*And betroths her to the Yellow Sprout.*
*This is the Great Medicine.*

To obtain the **essence of Heaven and Earth** (天地之精) within the **Primordial Palace** (元官) is the **natural method of creation and transformation** (造化自然之道), known as the **harmony of Three and Five** (三五一). Why? Because the **Three** (三) represent the **symbols of the Three Realms** (三才之象: 神、气、精), while the **Flower Pool** (华池) derives from the **Five Phases** (五行). Its exterior is **red**, its interior **white**—not the **cinnabar of the mundane world** (世之朱砂). Taken from **fire**, it is thus named the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀); emerging from **emerald-white mercury** (青白之汞), it is called the **Incredulous Maiden** (诧女). The **Yellow Old Woman** (黄婆) acts as its matchmaker, uniting with the **seventh of the Northern Celestial Stems** (北方之七). This is not the cinnabar used in the world, but the **mercury extracted from water** (内出水银为汞). The teachings of the ancient **perfected ones** (至人) speak only of **lead-mercury, Divine Water, and Flower Pool** (铅汞、神水、华池) in the **harmony of Three and Five** (三五一).

The **names of the Great Medicine** (大药之名) again total **twenty-four** (二十四): **Jade Elixir and Nectar** (玉液琼浆), **Flower Pool** (华池), **Yao Ming Essence** (杳冥精), **Vague and Indistinct** (恍惚), **Five Phases Essence** (五行精), **Kan Male** (坎男), **Li Female** (离女), **Fire Dragon** (火龙), **Water Tiger** (水虎), **Wood Essence** (木精), **Azure Dragon** (青龙), **White Tiger** (白虎), **Fierce Three Flowers** (猛三花), **Soul** (魂), **Golden Crow** (金乌), **Jade Hare** (玉兔), **Earth Steed** (地马), **Li Palace** (离宫), **Couple** (夫妇), **Golden Elixir** (金液), **Red Dragon** (赤龙), **White Sprout** (白芽), **White Snow** (白雪), and **Moon Spirit** (月魄). These are the **true pairings of husband and wife** (夫妇匹配), where **red and white mutually support** (赤白相扶), and **yellow earth serves as the furnace** (黄土为坛), embodying the **authentic Dao** (真正之道).

Refining the **Flower Pool Elixir** (华池炼药) relies on **fire alchemy** (火候). When the smoke has fully dissipated, the flames rise like stars, and the **five-colored light** (五彩) shines with sound. Once refined, it resembles **frost and snow, pearls and jade** (霜雪、珠玉). Its root lies solely in the **Five Phases** (五行). The **base metals and minerals of the world** (世之金石顽物) cannot transmute into elixir.

The *Classic* (《经》) states:
*The Azure Emperor protects the soul,*
*The White Emperor attends the spirit,*
*The Vermilion Emperor nourishes the qi,*
*The Black Emperor governs the blood,*
*The Yellow Emperor oversees the true essence of the Five Phases.*
*This is the Great Medicine.*

Thus, the **names of the Great Elixir** (大丹之名) again total **twenty-four** (二十四): **Grand Returning** (大还), **Golden Elixir** (金丹), **Jade Elixir** (玉液), **Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎), **Two Qi** (二气), **Four Spirits** (四神), **Five Halos** (五霞), **Divine Cinnabar** (神砂), **Luminous** (光明), **Flowing Pearl** (流珠), **Soul Retrieval** (返魂), **Life Seizing** (夺命), **Spiritual Herb** (灵芸), **Life Nurturing** (养命), **Longevity** (延寿), **Crucible Spirit** (坩灵), **Ten Thousand Spirits** (万灵), **Crimson Snow** (绛雪), **Concealed Fire** (伏火), **Pure Flow** (素流), **Swift Vitality** (快活), **Longevity** (延龄), **Rejuvenation** (返童), and **Longevity Immortal** (寿仙). These are all **aligned with the human body** (按於人之身者).

Those who use **five metals and eight stones** (五金、八石) forged with fire (火锻) are mistaken. They fail to grasp that the **sublime essence of lead and mercury** (铅汞之灵) lies solely in the **vague and indistinct** (杳冥恍惚). **Mercury** (汞) resides within **cinnabar** (砂), while **gold** (金) dwells within **lead** (铅). **Mercury** (汞) dwells within **lead** (铅), and **water** (水) within **gold** (金). Without the **key method**, seeking it is difficult!

Some, failing to comprehend the **Golden Elixir**, resort to **visualization and breathwork** (存想吐纳), **swallowing mist and ingesting qi** (吞霞服气), **feasting on pine and swallowing cypress** (餐松饵柏绝食). This is not the **Dao I speak of** (大道).

The **Dao** has **three levels** (三道). The highest is **Embracing Unity** (抱一). **Embracing Unity** means **unifying the Five Phases into One** (聚五行为一). The **most refined essence of Heaven and Earth** (天地至精), **paired yin and yang** (阴阳匹配), and **harmonized husband and wife** (夫妇相乘) refine the **essence** (精) and **condense the qi** (采气). Their **gathering** (采) follows the **celestial stems** (日辰), their **collection** (取) aligns with the **hours** (有时候). They employ the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) to **augment the fire alchemy** (增喊火候), using **water and fire** (水火) to **achieve mutual aid** (既济其用). With sufficient refinement, one attains the **rank of flying ascension** (飞仙之品).

Its middle level is **Enriching the Realm and Securing the People** (富国安民). This involves **capturing the Dragon in the deep pool** (擒龙於深潭) and **subduing the Tiger in the abyss** (伏虎於坎户), **aligning the Eight Trigrams’ medicines** (按八卦之药) within the **Nine Palaces** (九官), thus achieving **nine returns and seven transformations** (九还七返).

Its lowest level is **Strengthening the Army and Conquering the Enemy** (强兵战胜). This refers to **spiritual intercourse without physical union** (神交体不交), **locking the lower furnace** (关锁其下), and **permanently sealing the #2 Elixir Field** (永锁丹田).

Those who **grasp the harmony of Three and Five** (三五一) refine the **Five Phases’ essence and qi** (五行之精气), **directing them to the Primordial Palace** (送在於元宫) and **forging them with fire alchemy** (用火候以锻之). When the **ninefold transformation** (九转) is complete, one may **return to the origin and restore the primordial** (返本还元).」

**The Great Return Elixir**

What is the **Great Return Elixir**? It is the **refined essence and qi of the Five Grains**—when cultivated, it grants longevity.

What is **Three and Five in Unity**? The **Three** refers to the **Three Powers**—*shen* (spirit), *qi*, and *jing* (essence). The **Five** refers to the **Five Phases**. Within the Five Phases, *jing*, blood, and *qi* harmonize to produce the **Five Flavors**, from which the **essence of the Five Grains** is extracted. Is this not what the *Yinfu* speaks of when it says, *"The Five Flavors can prolong life"*?

The Five Grains can **steal from man to kill him**, yet man cannot **plunder the essence of the Five Grains**—how lamentable! **Unity in One** means **gathering the Five Phases in the Primordial Palace**, refining them with **fire alchemy** until they become the **True One**.

**The *Taibai* Return Elixir Chapter**

The **Datilang** (Datilang) is high, where **Primordial Qi** resides;
Its arrival is like the **Yellow River**, descending from Heaven.

**Qingxuzi Taibai Mountain Man Wang Yuan Zheng** (self-styled), a man of the **Xixu era of the Tang**, said:
*"The secret of elixir cultivation lies in **calming the mind within the chamber**, between the **second and fourth watches** (1–7 AM). First, **harmonize the breath**—this is called the **Law of the Ritual Bath**. With both hands, rub your palms until warm, then stroke your face upward and downward over your body. Then, **rise to Heaven and stand upon Earth**—
With both hands crossed, **stretch upward with all your strength to the crown**, lifting toward Heaven—this is **Rising to Heaven**; with both feet firmly planted, **lift your body upward**—this is **Standing on Earth**.

**Beware the eight forbidden days**: the **new moon, full moon, and the three days before and after each**—the **upper and lower trines of the lunar phases**.

In the **fourth and tenth lunar months**, the **three corpses**—*Pengju*, *Pengqiao*, and *Guozhi*—guard the **Spirit Treasury** (the Heart). Knowing this will **summon demons**.

First, **nourish the Liver**: visualize a **green dragon coiling** within it;
Then, imagine the dragon’s eyes emitting light from your own—**exhale and inhale nine times**.

Next, **nourish the Heart**: visualize a **crimson phoenix** within, its **red *qi* rising from its belly to your mouth**—**exhale three times**.

Then, **nourish the Spleen**: visualize **Gouchen**, the **black tortoise**, with **tiger ears and a single horn**, its **yellow *qi* rising to your mouth**—**use your tongue to block the throat**, then **inhale twelve times**.

After, **nourish the Lungs**: visualize a **white tiger** within, its **white *qi* rising to your mouth through the nose**—**inhale seven times**.

Finally, **nourish the Kidneys**: sit upright, stretch your soles, and **pull upward with your hands**. Then, **close the breath and pause**—visualize the **Kidney Palace**, where **two black *qi* streams emerge from your eyes**, flowing into your mouth as **golden jade fluid**, the **Hua Chi Divine Water**.

**Nourishing the Five Organs** takes **seventy-two days**—this is the **Lesser Return Elixir**, sufficient to **dispel illness**.

Then, **knocking the teeth to gather the spirit** thirty-six times, **open and close your eyes**, cover your ears with both palms, and **strike the crown with your fingers**—three times on the left, four on the right—this is **Striking the Heavenly Drum**.

Now, sit still: **cross your left hand’s three fingers with your right’s four**, clasping the **Kidney Cavity**—this is **visualizing the Cauldron’s Heaven and Earth**.

**Heaven and Earth within the Cauldron** never leave the body.
The **left eye** is the **Sun**; the **right eye**, the **Moon**; the **Datilang**, **Heaven**.

Why is the **Datilang called Heaven**? Because, like Heaven, it **cannot be ascended**.

The Sage’s method is to **return to the origin and restore the Primordial**—when **Primordial Qi ascends to the Datilang**, the **Heavenly Gate opens**, and the **flow of coming and going** moves like the **Yellow River descending from the Celestial River to the sea**.

The **hair** is the **stars**; the **ears**, the **hidden valleys**. The **brows** are the **ten thousand forms**.
The **nose** is the **Mysterious Female**; the **mouth**, the **Heavenly Granary**; the **tongue**, the **Red Dragon**—the Granary **receives all things**, the Dragon **plows the fields**.
The **throat** is the **twelve-tiered pavilion**.

The **Five Organs** are the **Five Sacred Peaks**; the **Six Palaces** are the **Six Ministries**—as seen in the *Baiwen* Chapter.

The **Three Burners** are the **Three High Offices**: the **Upper** as the **Grand Teacher**, the **Middle** as the **Grand Tutor**, the **Lower** as the **Grand Guardian**.

The **Four Waters** are the **Four Readings**—as seen in the *Baiwen* Chapter.
**Sweat** is **rain**; **breath** is **wind**.

Below the **navel** lies the **Sea of Essence**, encircled like a ring.
**Thirty-six revolutions** on each side—visualize within the ring a **Jade Maiden**, who **bowing enters and exits the right kidney**.

The **right kidney** is the **Jade Hall**; the **left kidney**, the **Gate of Life**.
The two kidneys are **two inches and five divisions apart**; their **original essence weighs one *jin***—corresponding to **Kan and Kun**. After **discharge**, from **sixteen years old**:
At **twenty-four**, it diminishes by **two *liang*** (corresponding to the *Lin* hexagram);
At **thirty-two**, by **four *liang*** (corresponding to the *Zhu* hexagram)—**walking causes breathlessness and foot weakness**;
At **forty**, by **six *liang*** (corresponding to the *Pi* hexagram)—**the waist and spine ache, the limbs weaken**, and the **navel stabs while the eyes dim**;
At **forty-eight**, by **eight *liang*** (corresponding to the *Guan* hexagram)—**the hair turns white and the skin wrinkles**;
At **fifty-six**, by **ten *liang*** (corresponding to the *Biao* hexagram)—**all actions become impossible**;
At **sixty-four**, by **twelve *liang*** (corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram)—**Primordial Qi decays**, relying only on **grain’s *qi***;
At **seventy-two**, only **two *liang* remain** (corresponding to the *Shi* hexagram)—**Earth transforms into Water**;
At **eighty**, the *qi* is exhausted (corresponding to the *Mingyi* hexagram)—**Water depletes, yielding to Fire**, and thus **death arrives**.

Therefore, those who **pursue the Dao** must first **subdue the *Jue* Maiden**.

Now imagine the **Jade Maiden** entering the right kidney, returning to her chamber, and gathering her essence.

Then visualize the **Xuanwu** (Dark Warrior) and the forms of **tortoise and serpent**, fearing harm to the Jade Maiden, compelling them to forcibly retreat. This is the method of **subduing the Jue Maiden**.

Then gather the **Three Souls**—**Daylight Brilliance**, **Luminous Spirit**, and **Gloomy Essence**—
and recite the invocation:
*"What is unknown, let me know it."*

Command them to dwell at the **Kan Gate**, on my left and right, calling them three times, imagining their spirits entering the **Sea of Essence**. Then, to the left, the **Three Palaces**; to the right, the **Seven Palaces**. Thus seated, practice the **Dragon-Tiger Circulation**, filling the mouth with *qi*, and swallow—this is the **Tiger**.

One **Dragon**, one **Tiger**, swallow twice, sending it from the throat, imagining it as a great river entering the **Sea of Essence**. Again swallow the Tiger as before.

Perform this **three times**, a total of **six swallows**, then send it into the **Sea of Essence**, imagining it as the **Three Rivers**.

Again, swallow **Dragon-Tiger three times**, nine times nine—**eighty-one times**—then swallow one **Dragon**, one **Tiger** as before.

Each **Dragon** and **Tiger** nine times—**eighteen directions**—imagining the **Nine Rivers** reaching the **Sea of Essence**.

Then perform **Dragon-Tiger forty-nine times**, totaling **fifty-six swallows**, imagining the **Great Sea** reaching the **Sea of Essence**.

Before and after, **Dragon-Tiger eighty swallows** total. Rise and sit again, performing **three passes of pulse-massaging**, then swallow **Dragon-Tiger** as before.

When the **eighty count is complete**, again massage the pulses and swallow **Dragon-Tiger** as before—**three passes total**.

The number of swallows is **two hundred forty**, corresponding to the **Twenty-Four Seasons**.

When the **spirit-essence is full**, imagine the waves of the sea surging below the navel. After **eighty-one days**, begin the **Dragon-Tiger Elixir**.

For a virgin boy who has not yet ejaculated, the **Dragon-Tiger Swallowing** method is unnecessary.

Now, seated and settled, first let the **Sea of Essence** boil and churn, then still and clear. Close the mouth, and with the **Red Dragon**, plow the saliva. When the mouth is full, divide into three swallows—this is the **Dragon**. When the *qi* fills the mouth, divide into three swallows—this is the **Tiger**.

Send it to the **Sea of Essence**, where it floats on the water’s surface. With intent, form it into a pill, pressing three times—this is the **Elixir**.

Imagine the **heart-fire** rising from the heart, descending to the water’s surface to forge it. Next, imagine the **spleen-earth**, covering the fire to reduce its intensity, then open the spleen-earth and forge again. Thus, **three times**, and when the Elixir is complete, it sinks into the water.

Then, as before, form it again, creating **Dragon-Tiger nine times**, making **nine Elixir pills**—this is the **Nine Transformations**.

The ancient verse says:
*"The Dragon follows, the Tiger follows the cavern;
The Dragon enters the water, and the Tiger follows too.
Thunder-fire burns the topknots and manes,
Clouds come, rain goes, mountains tremble."*

This is the analogy.

Like a husband and wife—
**Fire** is the **female**;
**Water** is the **child**;
**Earth** is the **matchmaker**,
and thus they are formed.

Each **pass** uses **three Dragons, three Tigers**—
**twelve fires** correspond to **twelve hours of the day**.

The **Nine Transformations** correspond to the **Nine Palaces**, totaling **one hundred eighty**.

Then, employ the method of the **River Chariot** to transport it—stirring the **Passage Locks**, raising the **Golden Bell**, and lifting the **Heavenly Balance**. Three times raise the **Valley Spirit** and **Valley Way**, urging the *qi* into the spine, and with the *qi* contracted upward, imagine the **Cinnabar** and **Essence** traveling the same path, ascending to the crown, where it is then **triple-pointed** to enter the **Marrow Palace**. Lift the head and turn left—this is the **Returning Essence to Nourish the Brain**.

Then, at the first light of dawn, sit facing east while seated westward, imagining the sun as a **wheel-chariot** and swallowing it. In total, **seventy-two gulps**, also using the **River Chariot** method to lift it into the crown before resting upon it. By the **thirteenth day**, at moonrise, sit with your back to the sun and face the moon, imagining as before. **Eighty-one gulps** are used, and the practice ceases on the **twenty-third day**.

Later, on the **eighth day of the month**, imagine the moon embracing it—this is the **Wearing the Sun and Clutching the Moon**.

The sun is **Yang**; seventy-two gulps are **Yin numbers**. The moon is **Yin**; eighty-one gulps are **Yang numbers**. This is the method of **inverted Yin and Yang**!

Then, settle upon the thought of the **Kidney’s Old Maiden**, naked in form yet desiring, and imagine the **Heart Fire** burning her. The ancient verse says:
*"Use lead, yet do not use lead—
One must act within the lead itself."*
This refers to this very practice.

The world does not grasp its principle, thus making it an **inner elixir of darkness**, thereby shortening one’s lifespan. The **Immortal** is only complete when the **inner elixir** becomes the **outer elixir**.

Thus, one can use the **Great Medicine** to transmute base substances into gold, yet some see this and do not recognize the **true lead** and **true mercury**—taking **mercury** as mercury and **black tin** as lead, desiring to transmute copper into silver. Is this not deception?

Then, with a single gulp of saliva, send it down into the liver, imagining the **Green Dragon** within the liver descending into the **Kidney Palace** to welcome the Old Maiden. When the Old Maiden sees the Green Dragon, she rides upon it—this is the **child-mother *qi***. The Green Dragon is **Wood**; the Old Maiden is **Water**. Welcoming her, it ascends into the **Crown Gate**, where the **three souls** and **multitudes of spirits** all enter.

The **Crown Gate** is the **Marrow Palace**. Then, imagine the **Heart Fire** descending, arising from each **spirit pass**, circulating through the body—both ascending and descending, like the **Liver Spirit’s** form—then **pointing** it. Initially, **twenty-one points**, imagining **Peng Ju**—a figure like a Daoist, discarding his cap and sandals to flee. Again, imagine the fire burning him, as in **twenty-four points**, imagining **Peng Qiao**—a bull-headed, human-legged figure, his form like a beast.

The **seven spirits** appear as:
- **Parrot-headed, dog-footed,**
- **Night-mara shapes,**
- **Female forms,**
- **Wind Lords,**
- **Hunting dogs,**
- **Bowmen,**
- **Fish-bearers.**

Thus, they all flee. After **one hundred days of burning the body**, the **corpse-poison** is exhausted.

Then, employ the **Fetal Breathing** method, quieting the mind and steadying the will, eliminating distractions, and maintaining singular focus. Thus, seated as before, practicing the **swallowing of sun and moon**, imagine above the **spleen** a land, where the land holds a **golden cauldron**. Within the cauldron is the **Infant Brother**, in your own form, kneeling inside it, with both hands resting on his shoulders. Facing upward with an open mouth, he then swallows the **sun’s essence, moon’s essence, golden liquid, and jade liquid**, as previously described.

On nights when there is no moon’s essence, use **golden and jade liquids** in **thirty-six gulps**. When both sun and moon are in season, use **fire at the proper time**.

Every **seven days**, the infant turns once. After **twenty-eight days**, this is the **fourth transformation**, and then **fire is applied**. The fire is beneath the cauldron, imagined to be covered by earth above, with the fire within the **earth stove**—the base of the cauldron. The sun moves through **one hundred eighty degrees**, and when the fire descends, it passes beside the **cauldron’s tortoise**.

Thus, with every **fourth transformation**, fire is applied—like nurturing fire. When ten cycles are complete, **fetal breathing** is achieved.

With **Great Fire** smelting, first remove the **jade lid**, and the **Infant** becomes the **Child of Longevity**, who, if exposed to fire, will naturally ascend to the crown and fly. This is the completion of the **Great Elixir**.

For women practicing this, imagine the infant in the cauldron, always covered with a **jade lid** to benefit the head, nurtured by fire, yet remaining **unfinished**.

Once the **Sacred Fetus** emerges, the sun wanders, but it cannot stray far. The **cauldron**—what is it? It does not depart from the **liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys**.

The cauldron is **metal**, four inches high, with a base of two inches—corresponding to the **lungs**. The **tripod** is **earth**, stacked in three layers, five inches high—corresponding to the **spleen**. The **charcoal** is **wood**, for after the body is burned, wood becomes charcoal—corresponding to the **liver**. The **fire** is the **heart**. The **kidneys** are the **chaste maiden**, giving birth to the infant—this is the **essence of vital *qi***.

Above, the **jade liquid** serves as the lid, so the cauldron’s lid wraps the **heart**. The heart can **gather all phenomena** to form the **Sacred Fetus**; without the heart, nothing can be achieved.

**Qian** is the **Heavenly Gate**; **Kun** is the **Earthly Door**; **Gen** is the **Ghost Gate**; **Xun** is the **Wind Gate**. The **kidneys** are **water**, ruling the **late winter**. This is the **chaste maiden**, the **playing tortoise** symbol. The method of **inverted Five Phases** makes the **heart** the **kidney’s husband**, their **essence-qi** merging to produce the **Sacred Fetus**.

The **spleen** is **earth**, ruling the **late seasons**. This is the **male symbol**, able to act as the **tripod**, harmonizing **Yin and Yang** to complete the **Way**, hence the saying **"Huang Po as the matchmaker."**

The **liver** is **wood**, ruling **late spring**. This is the **Chancellor Green Dragon** symbol. Wood originally generates fire, fire generates wood, and when reversed, it becomes charcoal—thus, it is called the **"Long-Life Charcoal."**

The **inner elixir** takes **three years** to complete.

Within three years, the months of **Ersuì** (二月, February) and **Bāyuè** (八月, August) are not used—only the **third and tenth months** are employed.

First, **fortify the five viscera** in **seventy-two days**; next, **supplement the essence** in **eighty-one days**. **Forming the Dragon and Tiger** takes **one hundred days**, and **swallowing the moon** takes **eighty-one days**—counted by days, this spans **ten months**. **Swallowing the moon** requires **fourteen days** of the month, and **eighty-one days** make **seven months**. **Burning the body** takes **one hundred days**, thus **three months**. Altogether, this sums to **twenty-one months**. Again, nurturing it for **ten months** completes the **Great Elixir** in three years.

Once the **Sacred Fetus** is formed, then comes the **treading method**. Imagine the infant has emerged—counting days as months, its steps double daily: from **ten steps, twenty steps**, up to **one hundred steps**, and by the **third day**, it can walk **a thousand *li*** (里).

At **one hundred days**, the infant resembles an **eight-year-old child**; by **one year**, it matches the practitioner’s own form.

Yet within **one *jì*** (纪, twelve years), if misfortune arises, there are **three responses**: **re-embryonation**, **relocating the dwelling**, and **repelling the killing ghost**.

**Re-embryonation**—why? It depends on recognizing external signs. Seeing:
- A **grand hall with high chambers**—**Dragon**.
- A **thatched hut**—**camel, mule, or horse**.
- A **felt carriage**—**tortoise or turtle**.
- A **boat or carriage**—**insects or serpents**.
- A **brocade canopy**—**wolf or tiger**.
- A **thatched pavilion**—**ox**.
- **Furs**—**elephant**.
- A **grain cart**—**sheep or goat**.
- **Jewel-like flowers**—**parrot**.
- **White hibiscus**—**goose**.
- **White lotus**—**duck**.
- A **black-lacquered pavilion**—**dog**.
- **Yellow robes**—**roe deer or stag**.
- **Brocade robes**—**pheasant**.
- **Hundred flowers in the forest**—**hundred crows**.
- A **felt pavilion**—**beasts**.
- **Baby armor**—**fish**.
- **Entering water**—**maggots**.
- **Marching in battle formation**—**bees**.
- **Many with the same name**—**ants**.
- **Jars and basins**—**snails**.
- **People walking in mountains**—**lice**.
- **Wielding swords and spears**—**crabs**.
- **Falling into a well**—**becoming female**.
- **Falling from a mountain**—**becoming male**.

**Relocating the dwelling**—why? If one first recognizes a familiar place, it is already **occupied by the dead**—an **empty dwelling**. Only if the practitioner has **not suffered from *fēnglíng*** (风玲, a wind-related ailment) and their **essence is firm and substantial** may they relocate. A **young boy** is superior, so I enter and **re-cultivate as before**.

**Repelling the killing ghost**—why? A practitioner, with the **fetus unformed** and the **embryo not yet distant**, suddenly faces a **critical moment**. How to subdue it?

If **any of the five hearts** (the **palms of both hands, soles of both feet, and the chest**) ache, the **critical moment** has arrived. Sit quietly in a secluded chamber and **visualize the *Cháozhēn*** (朝真, "Facing the True Self"). **Facing the True Self** means **darkening the mind**, sealing within its **ears, eyes, nose, tongue, hands, feet**, and all **superfluous *Rén-Gǔi*** (壬癸, residual *yin* energies) with **locks**.

Use the **teeth as a fortress**, the **heart as fire**, and **burn the body**. When ghosts appear, **do not fear**. The **heart** is the **Emperor**, storing the **Three Treasures** within the **nose and feet as the Three Platforms**, illuminating all **subjects**. The **liver’s spirit** governs **thirty-six thousand luminous essences**, its guardian on the **left**. The **lung’s spirit** governs **twelve thousand forms and shadows**, its guardian on the **right**. The **spleen’s spirit** governs **eighty-four thousand pores**, its guardian in **front**. The **kidney’s spirit** governs **fifty thousand refined *yuánqì*** (元气), its guardian on the **back**. The **crown’s spirit** and **head’s spirit** govern the **hair**, their guardian above in the **Upper Official**. The **gallbladder’s spirit** guards the **lower region**.

The **six bowels** are the **Six *Dīng*** (六丁, celestial warriors), battling the ghosts—**the ghosts retreat**.

After **three *wǔ*** (五, five-day periods), if they return, **abandon the fortress**, ascend directly to the **Celestial Bureau**, becoming either a **Celestial Immortal** or an **Earthly Immortal**. An **Immortal** must have a **sword**.

How is it forged? The **body as the furnace**, **essence-qi as iron**, **sunlight and moonlight as steel**, the **liver as charcoal**, the **lungs as bellows**, the **heart as fire**, the **spleen as clay**, the **kidneys as the mold**, the **gallbladder as the whetstone**, and **leftover iron as a dagger**. How is it forged? **Only through visualization**.

Then there is the **golden hammer**: each time **Dragon and Tiger** are swallowed, they do not reach the **kidneys** but are **both stored above the lungs**. The **lungs**, being **metal**, are **forged into completion** in one casting.

**Volume 28: *Tàiqīng Yǎngshēng* (太清养生) – Upper and Lower Chapters**

**Volume 28: *Tàiqīng Yǎngshēng* (太清养生) – Upper Chapter**

Collected by the wandering scholar Zēng Càng.

Ancient elixirs of precision emerged from the *Tàiqīng*—
First to dispel sickness, finally to awaken the numinous.

Do not force prolonged breathing.
With prolonged practice, the breath will lengthen naturally.

Let the *qi*’s movement be inaudible to the ears—
As if present, yet as if still—
Do this until the hundred vessels pulse and the abdomen resonates.

What ailment shall the practitioner not overcome?

In guiding and drawing:
The *xū* (deficient) should close the eyes;
The *shí* (replete) may open them.

The *xū* should be supplemented;
The *shí* should be drained.

Inhaling through the mouth and exhaling through the nose—this is supplementation;
Closing the mouth and swallowing warm *qi*—this is drainage.

For illness in the chest, raise the pillow seven *cùn*;
For illness beneath the heart, raise it four *cùn*;
For illness below the navel, remove the pillow.

「Right flank lying down, inhale *qi* through the nose, and swallow warmly through the mouth seventy times, then rub the left and right hands together to generate heat, and use them to massage the abdomen, urging *qi* to descend and exit through the lower body. After seven breaths, cease—this can dispel flank and skin pains.

Lying on the back without a pillow, standing with both feet, inhaling *qi* through the nose sixteen times, then exhaling gently through the nose—
When inhaling, do not close the nostrils, and when the breath reaches its limit, this can dispel internal body heat and back ailments.

Sitting upright with hands crossed behind the knees, close the *qi* and distend the abdomen, repeating twice seven or thrice seven times. When the *qi* is full, exhale—thus all *qi* flows freely. Practiced for ten years, this can reverse aging and restore youth.

Sitting upright, stretch the arms as if drawing a full bow, to treat numbness and stiffness in the limbs and back.

Extend the arms to the left and right while straightening the waist. Inhale *qi* through the nose and close it to its utmost—this can dispel flank accumulations.

The *Classic* says: Sit with knees drawn toward the chest, gripping firmly without pause. After one cycle, raise the hands and guide them left and right. Cover both ears with the hands, and place the fingers along the edge of the two pulses#3. Five cycles can clarify the vision, darken the hair, and dispel wind.

The *Classic* says: For nighttime *qi* practice, first purge the lingering *qi* by twisting and turning. Close the eyes, grip firmly, and lean back. With the left fist placed at the *breasts*, raise the pulses of both ears to the back and the *shīnèi*#1, close the *qi*, and let the *qi* from the *Qìhǎi*#2 surge forth from within. Twist and guide it, then exhale#3 forcefully. After nine cycles, cease—only then can one properly regulate and ingest *qi*.

The *Classic* says: Humans inherit the *original qi* of Heaven and Earth. Whether swallowing or exhaling *qi*, the internal *qi* naturally responds in kind.
From the *Qìhǎi*#2, follow the exhalation upward until it reaches the throat. Wait until exhalation is complete, then inhale continuously with a sound like *mìmì*#4, descending from the left through the twenty-four *nodes*.
For women, the *qi* descends from the right. Direct it with intention, and assist with hand movements, urging it swiftly to the five *original qi* at the *Qìhǎi*.
The *Qìhǎi* is located three *cùn* below the navel.

At the beginning of *qi* practice, when the internal *qi* is not yet flowing freely, one must massage to aid its movement. Continuously swallowing without closing the mouth is called *Cloud Movement*; swallowing saliva along with the *qi* is called *Rain Application*. Initially, when internal *qi* is not yet flowing, one cannot continuously swallow. After practicing for three years, the *qi* will flow freely on its own, descending without massage—then success can be achieved.

The *Classic* says: Extend both arms to the sides, repeating nine cycles without pause—this can cure arm pain and exhaustion.

Use both hands as if lifting a stone weighing a thousand *jīn*#5, alternating left and right—this can ensure lifelong health.

Exchange the legs to sit cross-legged (*jiāobèi*), with both hands crossed behind the head, extending the fingers outward to their fullest, then lowering the head to the ground without pause for six cycles—this can treat waist pain that prevents turning the head to look backward.

Lift the head and rub the abdomen with the hands, then grasp the feet while leaning against a wall, repeating twelve cycles without pause—this can treat knee stiffness that hinders walking, as well as waist and back pain.

Sit upright, with both hands crossed behind the kidneys—this can treat emaciation and regulate urination and defecation.

Sit upright, facing the sky, exhaling the *qi* of intoxication and overindulgence—this can immediately disperse alcohol and food, and if practiced repeatedly, one will endure cold without suffering heat.

Turn the feet outward ten times, then inward likewise—this can replenish exhaustion and strengthen *qi*.

**Laozi** (赤松子) says:
First, kneel for a long time, with both hands stretched forward, fingers pointing outward. Next, cross the hands behind the waist on either side, then with the right hand pull the waist, while the left hand is raised above the head and held still. Next, stretch the right hand backward, while the left hand crosses in front of the abdomen. Then, slowly assume the kneeling posture again, alternating the hands—stretching forward, then bending backward—while crossing them behind the waist. Finally, raise both hands high, and if this is done constantly, hearing and vision will sharpen, and a hundred maladies will not arise, prolonging life.

Each practice begins with kneeling.

**Ge Xian Gong** (葛仙公) says:
I have heard that those who practice fasting and *qi*-cultivation (*fúqì*)* must inhale (*yàn*)* five hundred and forty times in the twelve hours of day and night, continuously without end. However, if one has not first cultivated through diligence and taken nourishing medicines or elixirs, and if the original *qi* is not yet abundant, yet abruptly ceases eating—these two aspects not yet harmonized—then this is a way of inviting peril and early demise.

Some say: "The more one inhales, the better; the goal is to feel fullness. Within a hundred days, if the joints have not yet loosened, then practicing this way will cause the abdomen to swell and become congested—how can this be the method of true cultivation?"

What is meant by *qi*-cultivation is *tāixī* (胎息). Just as an infant in the womb, for ten months without food, yet able to grow and thrive—this is because it draws upon the original *qi*. But once born, it inhales external *qi*, and then there is the sound of crying, and it also knows dryness and dampness, hunger and satiety—this is because it has lost the original *qi*.

Now, those who merely draw *qi* through the nose and swallow it are also inhaling external *qi*—how can this suffice for cultivation? Truly, those who practice *qi*-cultivation must first attain a state of *wú sī wú lǜ* (无思无虑), a tranquil mind severed from all attachments, where all thoughts are forgotten. Then, the original *qi* will naturally arrive, and by swallowing it, each breath returns to its proper place.

Some say: "The five directions correspond to the five *zàng* organs—one must focus on them while cultivating."
**Ge Xian Gong** says: "No. Thinking of them creates attachment; attachment brings disturbance to the mind, and a disturbed mind cannot settle the *qi*. If the *qi* is unsettled, there is no natural harmony, and without natural harmony, the *qi* will lose its measure. Then, one invites harmful *qi*, and maladies will arise from this."

Some say: "Before fifteen days, *qi* is exhaled through the hands; after fifteen days, it is exhaled through the feet."
**Ge Xian Gong** says: "No, that is incorrect."

Those who practice visualization do so because they suffer and employ it as a remedy. As the *Huángtíng Jīng* states: *"Things that do not interfere with the Great Harmony and remain balanced are those without thought or contemplation."*

Some say: *"Count ten breaths with each finger movement; at seventy breaths, swallow once."* **Ge Xian Gong** says: *"No. The act of swallowing *qi* must be done with a mind of non-action, abandoning the body as if it were no body. In movement, rest, sleep, or waking, one must follow nature spontaneously. Only when the belly is empty should one practice; when ill, one must attack the ailment. To count with bent fingers is already laborious!"*

Some say: *"Draw the *qi* in through the nose, compress it, and swallow it. After a long while, continue inhaling and exhaling in succession, like water pouring from a bottle."* **Ge Xian Gong** says: *"This method is harmful enough to kill a person. Only in movement, rest, sleep, or waking should one habitually draw in pure *qi* through the nose and expel turbid *qi* through the mouth. The turbid *qi* is the breath of the five *zàng* organs from food and drink. If the throat is dry, close the mouth and let the nose breathe freely, and thus saliva will generate."*

Those who practice *qi*-swallowing should, upon waking at night or at the hour of *yín* (3–5 AM), internally regulate their *qi* and practice exhalation-inhalation. Lie on your back, stretch out your limbs, lower your pillow, quiet your mind, and unify your intention without thought or contemplation. Dwell on the *qi*, drawing it in through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, with breath flowing naturally. Close your mouth and inhale, drawing the *qi* upward into the mouth, then swallow it gently. After each swallow, rub the area to disperse it and guide it downward with your intention. Rubbing should occur every twenty to thirty breaths.

When the upper *jiāo* is unblocked, the swallowed *qi* will pass beyond the navel. If not yet unblocked, it will remain in the chest. Wait until mealtime—when you feel the chest empty and *qi* descending, then eat only when hungry, never overeating, for overeating obstructs the *qi*. After eating, wait until the chest feels empty again before practicing further.

For beginners, the three *jiāo* are not yet unblocked, and the joints are not yet open. Excessive practice will cause stagnation. Begin with three to five swallows, increasing to a hundred by the hundredth day, then adding thirty to forty swallows by the 150th day, reaching two hundred swallows by the 200th day. After a year, when the *qi* flows freely and the joints open, swallow three to five times in succession whenever the belly is empty. Never exceed three hundred swallows in a day. After three years, the *qi* will circulate fully, harmonizing with the five *zàng* organs. Then the bones will harden, the flesh will fill out, and the number of swallows need not be limited.

Those who practice *qi*-swallowing should eat only plain rice gruel in the morning, plain *miànbǐng* (wheat flatbread) at noon, and plain *bèituō* (steamed bread) in the evening. Avoid greasy, rancid, or pungent foods—such as butter, spoiled oils, raw vegetables, or fermented odors—as well as hot soups. After each meal, open your mouth to expel the five flavors’ toxins. If you feel bloated or *qi* stagnation, sit quietly to regulate the *qi*; soon, it will disperse and descend naturally.

Some say: *"Do not let it descend; retain it tightly."* **Ge Xian Gong** says: *"No. If the five *zàng* organs already harbor stagnant *qi*, forcing retention without release will cause pain and suffocation. Thus, before the old *qi* exits, the new *qi* will clash, leading to illness—how can one not let it descend?"*

**Ge Xian Gong** asks: *"What is the purpose of refining *qi*?"* When practicing *qi*-swallowing, if there is leisure, enter a quiet room, loosen your hair, remove your clothes, cover yourself lightly, lie on your back with limbs extended but not clenched, place a mat beneath you, and arrange your hair to hang down. Then regulate your *qi* and wait for it to settle before swallowing. After swallowing, close your mouth, exhaust the breath until suffocation occurs, then quiet your mind without thought, letting the *qi* move as it will. When suffocation arises, open your mouth and release it.

At first, when the *qi* exits with rapid breathing, regulate it. After seven or eight breaths, up to ten, when the *qi* stabilizes, refine it again. The refinement may be five, six, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty times—gradually increasing. With prolonged practice, the joints will open and the pores will unblock. When refining reaches twenty or thirty times, the body will sweat—this is the effect.

Refinement should be done at will during the day or night, but only when the spirit is clear and calm. Sit and practice swallowing; if sleepy, rest, but do not force it, for forcing will disrupt the *qi*. Thus, refine the *qi* every ten or five days. If the four limbs feel sluggish and uncirculated, practice accordingly.

Why abandon the *qi*? Because the body is pure and harmonious, the mind free of thought. In movement, rest, sleep, or sitting, regulate the breath. Relax the body completely, as if folding clothes upon a bed—without tendons, without bones, without perception or discrimination. Let the body and mind relax freely, like folded clothes, without control. Silent and still, release the form, purify the spirit, and refine the *qi*. Thus, all joints open, tendons and vessels circulate, and fluids flow. Then one can swallow and close the *qi* ten times, up to twenty.

Each swallow must be done naturally, letting the *qi* flow without forcing it. After a long while, the *qi* will exit through the pores, rarely through the mouth—perhaps once or twice in ten cases. Adjust and regulate again, over tens or hundreds of breaths, without inhaling and swallowing due to panting. With prolonged breath regulation, the body will feel as if bathed.

As the practice advances, the essence will be full, the *qi* complete, the spirit calm, and the soul steadfast. The mind will open, thoughts will extend, the *sānshī* (three corpses) will depart, and the *liùchén* (six dusts) will vanish. If the four limbs are restless and the *qi* stagnant, abandon it—whether lying or sitting—and purify the spirit to release the *qi*, regulating the breath to still the mind.

With prolonged concentration, the *qi* will flow and circulate without limit.

What is the Dao of holding the *qi*?
The superior sage, with spirit steadfast and *qi* regulated, banishes external illness naturally.
The middle sage, through proper cultivation and adherence to method, occasionally falls ill, but can heal by lying quietly in a well-appointed room, reclining on thick mats, arms and legs extended four inches apart, each covered with thick cloth.
With a tranquil mind and relaxed posture, they refine the *qi* and swallow it inward.
Then, they open their mouth but not their nostrils, focusing their intent on the afflicted area, directing the *qi* to strike it—when the *qi* reaches its limit, they exhale, then inhale again and close.
If panting occurs, regulate the *qi* over six or seven breaths, and it will soon flow smoothly.
Close the *qi* once more, visualizing and directing it to attack the affliction, repeating the process ten, twenty, thirty, or fifty times.
If the illness is in the left hand, they direct the *qi* inward through the left;
If the illness is in the right hand, they direct it inward through the right.

「If the illness is in the head, they direct the *qi* inward through the head, and thus sweat will emerge, moistening and harmonizing the area, until the illness is cured. If it is not yet cured, at the start of the hour of the Tiger (寅), they repeatedly focus their intent on attacking it until the illness is cured.

The *Tai Qing* Nurturing Life Lower Section (*Jing*) states: The human body has twelve major joints and three hundred and sixty minor bones, each pore facing its counterpart, each pulse connecting and communicating. New *qi* and old *qi* interweave, where the new *qi* may either suddenly stagnate or flow steadily, while the old *qi* may either circulate freely or become congested, or both may be obstructed, or both may rush forth. Congestion indeed is where the *yang qi* gathers and forms clumps and lesions; sudden stagnation is where the *yin qi* accumulates and leads to swelling or ulcers. Since *qi* can be stored and gathered, it also follows that it can be dispersed.

For any illness present, one may use *Dao Yin* (導引) to disperse it, harmonize the *qi* to attack it, focus the mind to guide it, employ clear *qi* to moisten it, swallow saliva to nourish it—what affliction could persist without remedy?

Yet the methods of nourishment and benefit all rely on saliva as their foundation. Thus, gold beams, jade grains, flower pools, and elixir meals are unattainable.

Sudden death is a *yang* phenomenon. It occurs when, due to severe pain, the *yang qi* suddenly stagnates at the four limbs and nine orifices, thus severing the breath.

Corpse-like rigidity (屍蹶) is also a *yang* phenomenon. Though dead, the pulse may still move, with sounds or none in the ears, and the thighs remain warm—this is where the *yang qi* is severed at the nine orifices, yet the four limbs still retain passage.

Sudden collapse (客性) is likewise a *yang* phenomenon. When external forces assault the body, the *yang qi* becomes obstructed and severed.

Five types of corpse-like death are also *yang* phenomena: **flying corpse** (一日飞尸) on the first day, **fleeing corpse** (二日遁尸) on the second, **wind corpse** (三曰风尸) on the third, **sinking corpse** (四日沉尸) on the fourth, and **poured corpse** (五曰注尸) on the fifth. When the chest and abdomen swell and ache intensely, or when a rolling mass rises beneath the ribs, these are all cases where *yang* is closed off by *yin*.

I have a method to revive them: Have the patient exert force to pull their left hand, then the right, then the left foot, then the right foot—each three hundred and sixty times. Then, with a leek heart (葱心) applied to the tip of the nose, blow into it. For men, first close the left nostril tightly and blow into the right, then block the right nostril and blow into the left. Blowing into the ears blocks the nostrils; blowing into the nostrils blocks the ears. The blowing should be slow and prolonged. Afterward, use a finger to close the leek’s hole, blowing forty-nine times into the left nostril, then the same into the right. For women, reverse the order: first blow into the right nostril, then the left, with the same count.

If no leek is available, use a reed pipe or any perforated object instead.

The nose governs the lungs, which are the canopy of all the *zang* organs (藏). The ears govern the kidneys, which are the root of *qi* circulation (通气之本). Sudden *Huo* disorder (霍乱) arises from the scattering of *ling qi* (玲气), where its passage is alternately obstructed and open, and its flow is suddenly halted or released—sometimes the *qi* should move *yin* but instead moves *yang*, or vice versa.

The method to treat it is this: In a secluded room, clad in thick garments, sit upright. Place the left and right hands on the two knees, then turn the body forcefully to the left sixty times, and do the same to the right. Alternate left and right until reaching three hundred and sixty repetitions. Then, take seven deep breaths. Afterward, perform seven prolonged blows, seven prolonged exhalations, seven prolonged cries, seven prolonged swallows, and seven prolonged sighs—thus the illness will be cured.

If the illness is severe and *Dao Yin* is impractical, have the patient pull their left hand, then the right, then the left foot, then the right foot—each three hundred and sixty times. Additionally, immerse their hands in boiling water up to the elbows and their feet up to the knees, changing the water as it cools, until the illness is cured. This is effective because external *qi* draws in internal *qi*, and it can also treat corpse-like rigidity.

Leprosy (癞) is a disease of the *Tai Yang* channel (太阳). When *yang* is repelled by *yin* and sinks into the bone marrow, if it lingers long, the new *qi* cannot reach it, and the old *qi* cannot circulate. The passages are congested, heat is suppressed, and foulness breeds parasites—thus leprosy arises.

The method to treat it is this: In a secluded, tranquil space, eat sparingly and remain unperturbed. Sit upright and relax the body, placing the left and right hands on the two knees. Turn the head and body forcefully to the left ten times, then to the right the same. Alternate left and right until reaching three hundred and sixty repetitions. Thus, the joints, blood vessels, and pores will open fully, and one may perform seven prolonged blows, exhalations, cries, swallows, and sighs—each five times—then employ clear *qi* to attack it six times.

The first method is this: Sit upright and relax the body. Slowly and deeply inhale clear *qi* through the nose, combining it with focused intent to make the clear *qi* permeate the bone marrow. Then, slowly and deeply exhale through the mouth. Afterward, rinse the saliva and swallow it—repeat this sixty times.

The second method is to exhale through blowing, the third through exhaling, the fourth through crying, the fifth through swallowing, and the sixth through sighing—all following the same pattern as the breathing method. Then, inhale clear *qi* slowly and deeply through the nose, combining it with intent to make it permeate the bone marrow, and exhale forcefully through the mouth. Rinse the saliva and swallow it sixty times. Thus, the *yang* parasites will be struck by *yin* and should perish.

It is best to perform this at the hours of the Tiger (卯), Horse (午), Rooster (酉), and Rat (子). Avoid consuming garlic (缅) and mutton.

When half the body does not respond, it is due to *yang qi* gathering and being obstructed by external cold, or when *yin qi* surges and disrupts it. Though the pulse may circulate, internally there is no passage.

The method to treat it is this: Sit upright and place the left and right hands on the two knees. Turn the body forcefully to the left ten times, then to the right the same. Alternate left and right, combining the movements, until reaching three hundred and sixty repetitions. Then, have someone exert force to pull the unresponsive limbs—each hand and foot three hundred and sixty times—followed by pressing down with the left and right hands on the unresponsive limbs, also three hundred and sixty times each.»

Once the exercises are complete, release the body and slowly inhale through the nose to draw in the pure *qi*. Then, slowly exhale through the mouth. When exhaling, direct the *qi* with intent into the affected limbs, and swallow saliva sixty times in succession. The techniques of *pui* (吹), *xū* (嘘), *hē* (呵), swallowing, and *xī* (唏) are performed likewise.

For severe cases where guided movements are unbearable, have someone forcibly pull the unresponsive limbs while you direct the *qi* with intent—this too may suffice.

When the entire body is swollen, *yang qi* is constricted within the five *zàng* (藏), surging outward to the skin, where it stagnates and fails to disperse. Sit upright, placing the hands on the knees, and forcefully turn the body left and right ten times each. Alternate directions, combining movements until completing three hundred and sixty repetitions. Then, inhale deeply through the nose to let the pure *qi* permeate the five *zàng*, exhaling forcefully through the mouth. Swallow saliva sixty times, and repeat the techniques of *pui*, *xū*, *hē*, swallowing, and *xī*.

For cases of extreme heat where saliva is absent, rely solely on guided movements: inhale pure *qi* through the nose and exhale turbid *qi* through the mouth.

This method also treats *páo* (庖) ailments. When heat *qi* assails and stagnates, causing swelling, blow forcefully onto the affected area fourteen times with the mouth. Then, warm the hands by rubbing them and press them firmly against the swelling. Next, exhale forcefully onto the swelling fourteen times. Repeat this process alternately until the swelling subsides.

For red, dry, and painful eyes—symptoms of liver heat—perform guided movements left and right three hundred and sixty times. Then, inhale pure *qi* slowly through the nose while visualizing it ascending to the eyes. The heat *qi* will be dispersed by the pure *qi*, naturally retreating and exiting through the mouth, where it can be expelled with a forceful *hē*. Completing three hundred and sixty repetitions will cure it. *Hē* governs the heart, as it originates from innate *qi*.

For deafness, when kidney heat *qi* assails the ears and is further obstructed by rebellious *yin qi*, perform guided movements left and right three hundred and sixty times. Then, pull the ears forty-nine times with force. Inhale pure *qi* slowly through the nose, directing it with intent to the kidneys, and exhale while swallowing. Repeat this three hundred and sixty times. Swallowing governs the kidneys, and pulling the ears dispels *yin*. Practicing twice daily will restore hearing.

For upward-rushing *qi* and coughing, *yang qi* stagnates within the *zàng*, surging upward and seeking release. If *yin qi* then intrudes, the two clash in the throat region, intensifying the cough as their conflict grows. It is as if blowing on a fire—though the breath (*qi*) is cool, the fire (heat) intensifies with each exhale. Thus, the treatment is as follows: Sit upright and perform guided movements left and right two hundred and forty times each. Then, push the elbows backward while thrusting the arms forward with force. Next, place the hands on the elbows and push them forward until they nearly meet. Stand upright, then bend the knees, placing the hands beneath the kneecaps. Push the elbows outward fourteen times each. Then, tilt the head to the left and use the shoulder to support it, repeating for the right side sixteen times each. Finally, stretch the neck upward four times, followed by seven repetitions each of long exhalation, blowing, *xū*, *hē*, swallowing, and *xī*. Perform this three times daily for swift recovery.

Additionally, inhale pure *qi* slowly through the nose and exhale forcefully through the mouth, swallowing saliva twenty times. The effects will be accelerated.

For upward-rushing *qi*, when beginning the movements, lift the foot and forcefully stamp it forward, then place it firmly behind—this is optimal.

For exhaustion (*láo* 劳), *yang* is depleted, or overindulgence in food causes *qi* to fluctuate—sometimes obstructed, sometimes surging—often worsened by consuming hot foods. The treatment is as follows: Sit upright and perform guided movements left and right forty-nine times each. Inhale pure *qi* slowly through the nose and exhale forcefully through the mouth, swallowing saliva. Complete one hundred and twenty repetitions, and if strength remains, increase to two hundred and forty or three hundred and sixty for even better results. Then, extend the left leg and place the left hand on the foot, rotating it left and right forty-nine times. Repeat for the right foot. Practicing twice daily will restore vitality. Thus, Master Pengzu said: *"Turning the feet inward and outward ten times each can dispel all exhaustion."* This refers to this method.

For *wēn yì* (温疫, febrile disorders), *yang qi* gathers in the *zàng*, permeates the vessels, and reaches the *shèng lǐ* (胜理, critical points). The treatment is as follows: Sit upright and perform guided movements left and right three hundred and sixty times. Guiding movements, as Master Dì Bèi (歧伯) said, involve bowing, stretching, and flexing. Master Gān Shǐ (甘始) said: *"Clasp the hands behind the neck and continuously twist left and right."* He also stated: *"Perform until sweating profusely—sweating is akin to powdering the body."* Then, kneel on the right knee and stamp the left foot forward, then kneel on the left knee and stamp the right foot forward, forty-nine times each. This may also be done while standing. Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth two hundred and forty times, increasing to three hundred and sixty for optimal results. Master Pengzu said: *"This can also cure malaria."* Malaria occurs when *yang* stagnates beneath the diaphragm, surging upward to escape, while *yin* above the diaphragm obstructs it. When *yang* leaks and discharges, its outbreaks follow a cycle—this is the competition of *yin* and *yang*, governed by natural rhythms.

At the moment when [malaria] is about to flare, perform *Dao Yin* exercises (guided movements) left and right, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions. Then, kneel on the right knee, extend the left foot, and stamp it forward forty-nine times; do the same with the right foot. Afterward, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, with each breath (呼) and exhale (嘘) counted as twenty-one repetitions—this shall cure it.

If blood is drawn from the nose (*鼻钮血*) or spat from the mouth (*口唾血*), it means the middle burner (*中焦*) is searingly hot, causing water to transform into blood. Thus, when the middle burner’s *qi* surges upward into the lungs (*肺*), the lungs then push it into the nose, resulting in *鼻钮血*. When the middle burner’s *qi* descends into the spleen (*脾*), the spleen then forces it into the mouth, resulting in *口唾血*. For those afflicted by this, few shall perish.

The method of treatment: Sit upright, perform *Dao Yin* movements left and right, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions. Then, extend both feet, and with the left hand grasp the right foot’s five toes fourteen times; do the same with the right hand. If blood is drawn from the nose, swallow saliva (*咽津*). Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, with each breath and exhale counted as sixty repetitions. If blood is spat from the mouth, swallow saliva as well. Repeat the swallowing and exhaling, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions, once per evening—this shall cure it. For severe cases, doing it three times a day may also suffice.

For *赤下* (hematuria), the lower burner (*下焦*) is searingly hot, and when water is ingested, the *yin* and *yang* *qi* contend within the lower burner, unable to follow the proper *Dao* (Way). When cold *qi* strikes intermittently, pain ensues. The method of treatment: Perform *Dao Yin* movements left and right, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions. Once done, swallow saliva. Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, with each breath (呼), exhale (嘘), and the techniques *呵、咽、晞* counted as sixty repetitions. Then swallow saliva again. Doing this four or five times a day shall cure it.

For *前后没不通* (incomplete defecation or obstruction in bowel movement), *yang* *qi* stagnates in the lower region and is repelled in reverse. The method of treatment: Perform *Dao Yin* movements left and right, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions. Once done, interlock both hands behind the back, with the left hand directed rightward and the right hand forcefully pulling leftward fourteen times; do the same with the right hand. Then, extend the left hand and with the right hand forcefully lift the left shoulder fourteen times; do the same with the right hand. Afterward, swallow saliva. Repeat the inhalation and exhalation (吐纳), along with *呼、吹、呵、咽、唏*, each for sixty repetitions. Doing this twice daily shall cure it.

Thus, Master Ning said: *"Sit upright and stretch the left hand, using the right hand’s fingers to pull the shoulder, treating obstruction in the anterior region (前搜不通). Interlock both hands behind the back, called '带缚' (girdle binding), treating obstruction in the posterior region (后没不通). This refers to the same method."*

For *淋* (stranguria), the water *Dao* (pathway) is searingly hot and dry, causing urine to leak intermittently. The method of treatment: Perform *Dao Yin* movements left and right, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions. Then, stand with feet apart and, with both hands inserted beneath the armpits (*陛*), grasp the five toes of the left foot with the left hand and the five toes of the right foot with the right hand, forcefully pulling inward fourteen times. Once done, swallow saliva. Slowly inhale through the nose to gather its pure *qi*, then exhale through the mouth, repeating this three hundred and sixty times. Doing this three times a day is even more beneficial.

For *疢* (a type of *yin* stagnation), it originates from *虚假* (emptiness or weakness), often following illness when the *qi* of all the viscera (*藏*) is disordered, and water is ingested. Once the *yin* *qi* enters, it prolongs the accumulated water. When the *yang* *qi* is taken in, it obstructs the accumulated *yin*. As the water *qi* grows stronger, it reaches the skin, manifesting as *疢*. Its signs include discoloration on the left and right sides of the face resembling an old *蠢* (a type of insect), and a watery sound in the armpits when turning. The method of treatment: Perform *Dao Yin* movements left and right, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions. Once done, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, followed by *嘘、呵、咽、唏*, each for sixty repetitions. Then, visualize the *qi* circulating throughout the body, practicing this three times a day and night. With persistence, it shall be cured. Avoid salty foods; consume *小豆汁* (mung bean broth) or soak cooked mung beans for the left and right feet—this is ideal.

For *反胃* (gastroptosis), the stomach accumulates *玲* (disordered *qi*) over time, causing *yin* *qi* to descend and stagnate at the abdominal opening (*腹口*). When hot food is consumed, the *yin* *qi* resists and rebounds, expelling it. The method of treatment: Always practice *Dao Yin* with an empty stomach, left and right, each for three hundred and sixty repetitions. Interlock both hands and with both feet stamp them against the hands forty-nine times. Place the left hand’s back beneath the left armpit and use the right hand to pull the left elbow seven times; do the same with the right hand. Then swallow saliva. Slowly and briefly inhale through the nose to gather its *qi*, then exhale through the mouth, repeating this one hundred and twenty times. Then swallow saliva again. Next, repeat the exhalation and inhalation techniques *咽、吹、唏*, each for sixty repetitions. Doing this three times a day shall cure it. For those lacking strength, doing it twice daily is also acceptable.

For *心腹坚痛* (severe, fixed abdominal pain), *yin* *qi* stagnates and accumulates in the heart and abdomen, congealing without dispersal. Even with thick layers of clothing, if *yang* *qi* strikes it, the *yin* and *yang* contend, exacerbating the *yin* stagnation. The method of treatment: Perform *Dao Yin* movements left and right, completing three hundred and sixty repetitions, then swallow saliva. Slowly inhale through the nose to gather its pure *qi*, then exhale through the mouth, ensuring warm *qi* disperses the accumulation. For all exhalation and swallowing techniques, complete up to two hundred and eighty repetitions. For breath (呼) and exhale (嘘), do the same. Practicing this twice daily and nightly shall cure it.

For *胸胁结癖* (chest and armpit masses or stagnation), it is a *yin* condition. Cold *qi* stagnates in the chest and armpits, or persists from prolonged improper diet. The method of treatment: On a clear morning, lie on your back. Stand with feet apart, and have someone use their hands to locate the mass root (*癖根*), gradually insert their hands beneath the mass root, lifting it slightly. At first, it shall be painful, but later it shall become bearable. Then, forcefully lift it one hundred and twenty times. After two or three days, increase to two hundred and forty repetitions. After five days, further increase to three hundred and sixty repetitions.

「Once this is done, perform *Dao Yin* (导引) three hundred and sixty times, then swallow the saliva (*咽津*). Inhale through the nose (*鼻纳之*), exhale through the mouth (*口呵之*), and with intent, direct the *qi* (气) to the site of the illness. Allow it to exit through the lower *orifices* (下部), completing one hundred and twenty repetitions, gradually increasing to two hundred and forty, and ultimately to three hundred and sixty, which is even more beneficial. Practicing this twice daily—morning and night—shall swiftly cure it.

For sudden distension of the *heart and abdomen* (心腹卒满), it is due to *yin qi* (阴气) dwelling in the *Zang* (藏). When it arises, it surges against the heart. The method of treatment: Perform *Dao Yin* (导引) by moving left and right, completing three hundred and sixty repetitions. Swallow the saliva and inhale the *qi*, then exhale through the mouth, allowing the *qi* to exit through the lower *orifices*. Completing three hundred and sixty repetitions shall cure it.

For *red eyes and protruding eyeballs* (目赤而相出), it is due to the *yin qi* of the liver (肝) surging against the eyes. The method of treatment: As before, perform *Dao Yin* (导引). Once done, swallow the saliva. Close your eyes (*暝目*) and inhale the pure *qi* through the nose (*以鼻纳其清气*); open your eyes (*开目*) and exhale the turbid *qi* through the mouth (*以口呵出其浊气*), completing three hundred and sixty repetitions. Practicing this twice daily—morning and night—shall cure it.

The *Sutra* (《经》) says: When an infant is in the womb, it develops over ten months, with sinews and bones harmonious and supple. By calming the mind (*以心息念*), the *qi* naturally aligns (*和气自至*), so those who practice *qi* cultivation (*服气者*) should emulate this principle. During the six *yang* times of the day, one should ingest the vital *qi* (生气). Thus, at the *zi* hour (子之时), one should cultivate nine times nine, eighty-one repetitions (*九九八十一*); at the *yin* hour (寅之时), eight times eight, sixty-four repetitions (*八八六十四*); at the *si* hour (巳之时), seven times seven, forty-nine repetitions (*七七四十九*); at the *wu* hour (午之时), six times six, thirty-six repetitions (*六六三十六*); at the *you* hour (酉之时), five times five, twenty-five repetitions (*五五二十五*); at the *xu* hour (戌之时), four times four, sixteen repetitions (*四四十六*).

When cultivating *qi*, use the tongue to expel the turbid *qi* (舌去其浊气), then enter and exit through its respective *gates* (门户). The nose is the *Heavenly Gate* (天门); the mouth is the *Earthly Orifice* (地户), where the essence of *qi* cultivation (*服气之魂魄*) resides. Entering through the nose and exiting through the mouth is the *Way of Harmony* (顺气). If practiced without interruption (*不报*), one may eliminate the *Three Corpses* (三尸) and attain longevity (*长生*).

The *Dao* (道) is *qi*. *Qi* is the *Gate of Essence* (精门); if one preserves their *jing* (精), it is like having a guardian within a chamber. When both *jing* and *qi* are complete, one is called a *True Person* (真人).

The body has three *elixir fields* (丹田). What are they? The brain is the *Upper Elixir Field* (上丹田); the heart is the *Middle Elixir Field* (中丹田); and the *Qi Sea* (气海) and *Gate of Essence* (精门) are the *Lower Elixir Field* (下丹田). Each of the three *Palaces* (三宫) has its own *spirit* (神). When the *spirit* wanders (*神驰*), *qi* leaks (*气漏*), and when *qi* leaks, *jing* is lost (*精泄*), and when *jing* is lost, the *spirit* perishes (*神丧*). Thus, *jing* is the root of longevity; the kidneys are the root of life. It is like a tree: without *jing*, the leaves wither; when the leaves wither, the branches decay; when the branches decay, the tree dies.

Generally, inhaling *qi* is *yin*; exhaling *qi* is *yang*. These two are called the *absorption of the essence of the sun and moon* (服日月之精华). *Qi* is the natural, spontaneous, and effortless void. When effortless, the mind remains undisturbed; when the mind is undisturbed, there is no external desire; when there is no external desire, the inner self is tranquil; when the inner self is tranquil, the *spirit* is settled; when the *spirit* is settled, the *qi* harmonizes; when the *qi* harmonizes, the *primordial qi* (元气) naturally arrives; when the *primordial qi* arrives, the five *Zang* (五藏) are nourished; when the five *Zang* are nourished, the hundred *meridians* (百脉) flow freely; when the hundred *meridians* flow freely, the *saliva and fluids* (津液) ascend in response; when the *saliva and fluids* ascend, one forgets the five tastes and ceases to feel hunger or thirst. Thus, *qi* transforms into blood, and blood transforms into marrow. In one year, the *qi* renews; in two years, the blood renews; in three years, the *meridians* renew; in four years, the flesh renews; in five years, the marrow renews; in six years, the bones renew; in seven years, the hair renews; in eight years, the sinews renew; in nine years, the form renews. This is the *Nine Circulations* (炼九还).

The *Sutra* (《经》) says: For the *blue-green essence* (束方青牙) of the liver, when ingesting (*服食*), drink with *morning dew* (朝华), lick the outer surface of the lips with the tongue (*以舌表舐其唇*), rinse the mouth, and swallow three times (*漱口而三咽之*). *Morning dew* refers to the roots of the upper teeth (*上齿根*).

For the *red elixir* (南方朱丹) of the heart, when ingesting, drink with *elixir pool* (丹池), stir with the tongue at the *tooth crevices* (齿曹), rinse the mouth, and swallow three times. *Elixir pool* refers to the roots of the lower teeth (*下齿根*).

For the *bright stone* (西方明石) of the lungs, when ingesting, drink with *dew essence* (露液), polish the teeth with the tongue seven times (*以舌琢齿者七匝*), rinse the mouth, and swallow three times. *Dew essence* refers to the saliva within the lips (*唇内津*).

For the *dark essence* (北方玄滋) of the kidneys, when ingesting, drink with *jade honey* (玉饴), and perform *Dao Yin* (导引) through the nose. Allow the *primordial qi* (元气) to enter the mouth, then breathe in and out while swallowing three times. *Jade honey* refers to the tongue (*舌*).

For the *central essence* (中央戊己), gaze upward at *Great Mountain* (太山). *Great Mountain* is the *preservation of jing* (守精). When ingesting the *preservation of jing*, drink with *honey spring* (醴泉), located behind the teeth and before the *suspended flavor* (悬味). *Flower Pool* (华池) is at the root of the tongue (*舌本根*), also called *Jade Flower* (玉英) and *Golden Beam* (金梁). Rinse the mouth and swallow three times.

For those who cultivate these *qi*, always at the *zi* and *yin* hours, sit upright with proper attire. Strike the *Jade Flower* (玉英) with the tongue, cleanse the *Flower Pool* (华池), rinse the *Honey Spring* (醴泉) and *Dew Essence* (露液), contract the nostrils, and draw the *qi* upward to the head, then downward into the mouth, transforming it into *Jade Spring* (玉泉). Guide the *qi* to the root of the tongue, swallow, and send it forth, so that the throat and abdomen both resonate (*皆呜*). Draw it into the *elixir field* (丹田). This is called the *root of longevity*.

When hungry, ingest the natural *qi*; when thirsty, drink the *Flower Pool’s essence* (华池之浆). What need then for hunger or thirst?

*Jing* is my *spirit*; *qi* is my *Dao*. Nurturing the *spirit* and drinking the *qi* is like an infant in the womb. Thus, I ingest the *yang* in the morning and the *yin* in the evening. *Lingzhi* (灵芝) and *Jade Flower* (玉英) grow within the five *Zang*.

Then, lie on your back to expel the *water Zang* (水藏); cover yourself to expel the *food Zang* (食藏). Next, lean against a wall and lift one foot, clench both hands into fists, and stir the mouth’s saliva with the tongue. Imagine the *qi* descending into the navel (*脐*), reaching down to the feet as the measure (*为度焉*).」

The *qi* is swallowed thus: close your mouth with force, raise your tongue, and make the space beneath it hollow. This is called swallowing the *primordial qi* (元气), and then food will no longer be needed.

When the count reaches ninety-nine (*九九*), it completes the cycle of heaven and earth. Naturally, blood transforms into *jing* (精), *jing* into sinews (筋), sinews into jade (玉), and jade into the *immortal’s bone* (仙骨).

The *Sutra* (《经》) says: those who practice *fetal breathing* (胎息) expel the turbid *qi* from the abdomen (腹), harmonizing heaven and earth, and then release their *spirit* (神) freely.

Their mind is like the boundless void (太空), all thoughts extinguished. The three *passes* (三关) are sealed, and the external *qi* aligns with the internal *qi*. Then, they close their mouth and rhythmically swallow, as if letting water drip into a well to guide it, until thirty-six swallows are completed—this is called the *Highest Purity Refinement of Form* (上清炼形).

But when the abdomen is empty, one may swallow and guide the *qi* without regard to sitting or lying.

Those who ingest *qi* (服气) sit quietly with eyes closed, knock their teeth together, and close their mouth. They contract their abdomen and puff out their cheeks, and then their mouth will open naturally.

Await the *qi* filling the mouth and descending into the throat, until nine breaths are taken in one inhalation (九下一息焉).

In spring and summer, ingest the *cool qi* (玲气); in autumn and winter, ingest the *warm qi* (暖气).

Generally, at the hour of *Yin* (寅), cover your mouth with both palms and forcefully exhale into them—this generates saliva. Use it to rub and wipe your face, and your complexion will become radiant.

Yet the great precepts of the *Dao* (道) are eighteen in number: do not seek wealth and honor forcefully (强求富贵), do not covet treasures and riches (贪冒宝货), do not fear many taboos (多忌讳), do not harm the *royal qi* (王气), do not seek fame and reputation (干名誉), do not commit evil deeds (为诸恶), do not delight in functional achievements (喜功名), do not be deceived by the senses of hearing, sight, and speech (为耳目口所误), do not be domineering (强梁), do not rely on false strength (伪仗), do not be hasty and impulsive (转躁), do not act without deliberation (举事不详), do not let the mind be restless (心倥倥), do not argue over right and wrong (争曲直), do not waste *jing* and *qi* (费用精气), do not indulge in fine clothes and delicious food (好衣美食), do not be excessive (盈溢), do not take pleasure in war (乐兵).

Thus, those who study the *Dao* must not let others know of it. If others know, then I will be born, and if I am born, then my name will arise—with the name comes calamity (祸).

**Dao Gunzhu Scroll Twenty-Nine**
*From the Collection of Youzi Zeng Zuo*
*Upper Clarity Golden Azure Chapter*

The quintessence of the Five *Qi*, refining its *jing* essence into brilliance;
Firmness and softness aligned—wandering in Azure Mist.

The *Yinluo* Child said: *"Gold is the first of the Five Phases, the root of the Five Fates, the quintessence of the Five *Qi*—thus, its firmness and softness must be properly positioned!"*
He who can master it may wander through the Azure Mist’s immortal precincts—thus, I call it *Golden Azure*.

Someone asked: *"What is its essential method?"*
The reply was: *"Take five *liang* of Great Sun [mercury] and fifteen *liang* of Great Yin [sulfur]. Blend them harmoniously, grind them in a mortar until finely pulverized, then wrap in ashless paper. Place in a long iron crucible, pressing it firm. Cover the top with Tang-dynasty ash, compacting it solid. Seal the crucible’s mouth with salt clay, bake until dry, then bury its opening in a pit, leaving only the medicine exposed. Burn with five *jin* of charcoal until one *fu* [time period] has passed. When removed, the substance will no longer scatter—this is the *Wu Zhu* [black pearl]. Its hue is black yet azure, glossy and luminous—this is its first transformation.

This is the *Flying Dragon, Crouching Tiger*—surpassing three years;
Nurturing cranes, concealing tortoises—sometimes spanning decades.

Next, place the elixir in a bottle, cover with a flat lid, seal the edges with clay half an inch thick. Dry it in the sun to form an earthen city: nine inches high, three feet wide, three inches broad. Fill its interior with cow or horse dung nine inches deep, then place the elixir within. Cover entirely with ten *dan* of dung, ignite the fire below. When extinguished, break the bottle to retrieve it—now red-yellow, like dried fermented bean curd flakes. This is the *Yellow Sprout*, also called *Golden Dog Child* or *Great Sun Rolling Pearl*.

The *Classic* says: *"The Great Sun Rolling Pearl entering the Azure Pool is mercury."* Nurturing mercury to form Purple Gold—its name is *Purple River Chariot*—is this not so? This is its second transformation.

Place it in a *Gaoche* bottle without oil, cover with a flat lid, seal with *liuyi* clay (six parts salt, one part ash), four inches thick around the edges, ensuring no gaps. Dry it in the sun, then place on a flat surface. Burn with five *jin* of fierce charcoal for three *fu* periods. Wait for the fire to die, then break the bottle to retrieve it. Its hue is purple and glossy, its weight like gold—this is the *Purple Ling* Elixir. When ingested at seven times nine doses, it transforms the bones into gold. This is its third transformation.

Select a white-glazed bottle, following the prior method, and place it in an Eight Trigram Furnace—the eight-cornered type. Twelve inches wide, equal height, with a sword planted at each of the eight sides, a mirror hung at each sword’s tip, and a cup of water and incense at each fire point. Ignite the flames, then break the bottle to retrieve it. Its hue is green, with a metallic wind rustling. Its weight is double that of gold—this is the *Dragon-Tiger* Elixir, the completion of the *Dao*.

Why is it called *Dragon-Tiger*? *"The horse-tooth [mercury] paired with sulfur—heaven’s omen advances and retreats as divine. Plundered from the *Li* Palace and Moon Hall, thus arises the radiant mist-hued light."* This is its fourth transformation.

Encase it in a *Fire Jade* bottle—*Dingzhou* porcelain—and blow it with *shunyang* furnace breath five thousand times. Gradually increase the charcoal, ensuring it does not soil with ash. Keep the furnace’s base flame steady—if it flickers, yin *qi* will breach outward, shattering the bottle. Blow it again eight thousand times, then retrieve the elixir when the fire dies. Above, a purple cloud veils it; below, golden stars and jade pillars radiate five colors—this is the *Golden Tiger* Elixir. This is its fifth transformation.

First, take the *Dragon-Tiger* Elixir and mix with eight *liang* of *Laonü* [arsenic], grinding it ten thousand times to form *Golden Tiger*. Burn it with seventy-two *jin* of fire—this is the *Preserve-Life, Everlasting* medicine. This is its sixth transformation.

Take the *Preserve-Life* Elixir and mix with one *jin* twelve *liang* of mercury, grinding it tenfold. With the divine elixir’s power, it can ingest half the mercury. Place it in the *Tiandi* Furnace—a silver cauldron—and nurture it for ten days—this is the *Huanai* Elixir. *"The golden dragon rolls ten times, the purple phoenix soars in the furnace, the vermilion crane nests in the pine, the green tiger guards the right flank."* This is its seventh transformation.

Place the elixir in a porcelain bottle, using two *jin* of **Hanjiang** *yùshí* [硫化汞]—crushed with bitter wine and rice vinegar into a paste—to seal the bottle completely. Carve a hole in the northern wall for placement. Then reseal with *yùshí* paste, leaving it for a hundred days before removal—this is the *Yin Elixir*. Its name is the *Soul-Shedding, Spirit-Nurturing Elixir*; ingesting it means dying before rebirth. This is its eighth transformation.

Store it in the bottle, and on **Pure Brightness Day**, submerge it in a well. Consuming it after a hundred days grants immortality; after two hundred days, one becomes an **Earthly Immortal**; after five hundred days, one ascends in broad daylight; after a thousand days, one’s dwelling is lifted to the heavens. Thus, one attains the **White Emperor’s** *Yùshuāng* [玉霜], the **Purple Sovereign’s** *Hóngxuě* [红雪], while *Laonü* laughs in the furnace and the infant rejoices in the cauldron. This is its ninth transformation.

**Secret Key:**
*"My eyes like the sun, my ears like the moon,
My nose like a gate, my heart like the sea,
My will like the wind, my body like the earth.
The Five Directions, the Five Peaks—all submit to me;
All beings of the great earth are my children."*

**The Golden Tiger Lead-Mercury Chapter:**
*"Things flourish luxuriantly—this is the essence of Heaven and Earth;
They coalesce through Yang, are nourished by Yin.
The Primordial Lord says: The Golden Tiger, lead, and mercury—
They do not transcend the Five Phases.
All things coalesce through Yang, are born through Yin.
Yin is the foundation of the Dao;
Yang is the beginning of Oneness.

When Yin and Yang contend, the patterns are established.
Thus, *Kàn* [坎] one, *Lí* [离] two—returning from Yin to Yang;
Two fires, one water—returning from Yang to Yin;
Water two, fire one—former patterns, latter substance.

Yet the Five Phases’ patterns, humans embody them.
The heart is fire, hidden beneath the lungs—its number is one;
The kidneys are water, paired at the *Mìngmén* [命门]—its number is two.
Thus, fire one and water two—this is the Dao’s origin!

Those who internally cultivate *Oneness* attain the *Yin Elixir*;
Those who externally cultivate *Oneness* attain the *Yang Elixir*.
The interplay of *Huan* [还] and *Dan* [丹] does not depart the Five Phases—
Its essence lies in discerning the true nature of lead and mercury.

Thus, relying on the *Great Changes*’ symbols,
Establishing **384 *zhū*** [铢] with the **24 Seasons**,
Using the **lunar and solar nodes** in upper-lower correspondence—**28 and 86**—
Setting **16 *liang*** of medicine,
With *Kàn* and *Lí* as the elixir,
Heaven and Earth as the furnace,
*Qián* [乾], *Kūn* [坤], *Zhèn* [震], and *Xùn* [巽] as the operations.

The *White Horse* [白马] *yáshā* [芽砂] is Yin-qi;
The *Golden Sand* [金砂] is Yang-qi.
All things’ birth and death return to Earth.
Earth’s sovereign is Yellow;
Metal’s sovereign is White.
Observe the *Yīngzǐ* [鹦子]—
Internally yellow, externally white—
The two *qi* interact thus.

The Northern Black Water, *Zǐ* [子], is
The Metal’s borrowed position, the Five Phases’ origin, the Dao’s foundation.
*Jia-Yǐ* [甲乙] *zhūshā* [朱砂]—within it, sprouts naturally grow.
Sun and moon radiate—when sufficient, they reside in the sand,
Their nature white, concealed by fire—this is *Heaven-born Lead*.
It emerges from *Jǐnxi* [锦溪], *Chénzhou* [辰州].

The Southern Red, *Wǔ* [午], is
The Fire’s borrowed position.
*Zhūshā* is mercury’s parent.
The Eastern Blue Wood, *Mǎo* [卯], is
The origin of Wood’s Dao, the parent of Yin and Yang.
All things each receive one *qi*, all drawing from this.
Bearing Yin while embracing Yang—
*Jia*’s essence, the sun’s spirit, fire’s parent.

The Western White Metal, *Yǒu* [酉], is
The Water’s borrowed position, the moon’s shadow.
Turning north to west, *Mǎo-Yǒu* face each other,
Metal and Wood contend, Water and Fire circulate—
Thus forming the essence of the Great Return.

The Central Yellow Earth, *Wù-Jǐ* [戊己], is
The borrowed position of *Huápú* [华池].
Yellow restrains Water—unmoving, it dies.
Thus, Earth is the parent of the *Huan Dan*—
The parent subdues all things.
Hence, the Golden Cauldron is Earth—
Three fives and one, without deviation.

Sun and moon are the Yang’s essence—
Their number is nine, within which lies nine.
Its color is black—
This is the *Wén* [壬] *Guǐ* [癸] Water’s symbol of the North,
Named *Yang within Yin*—Yang containing Yin.
Thus, *Lí*’s *Bǐng-Dīng* [丙丁] Fire Palace attains the name *Nine*,
Coalescing *qi* into *Zhūyīng* [朱英], refining it to solid form—
This aligns with the *Three-Five-One*.

Ancient sages thus refined the sun’s essence,
Returning their bodies to pure Yang.

Mercury is of the Water family.
Its nature contains Yang—
Internally Yang, externally Yin,
Yang symbolized by Yellow, Yin by White.
Thus, externally red enclosing yellow—
Mercury is born from sand, mercury from lead—
This is *Yang within Yin*—
Yin does not stand alone, nor Yang lack its pair.

The moon is the accumulated essence of Yin, occupying the *Kàn* position,
Its number fixed at one.
Yin and Yang contain the Mysterious—
Spirit and shadow resonate.
The moon’s *Chán-Tù* [蟾兔] is Yin and Yang—
Its color white, bearing the *West’s Gēng-Xīn* [庚辛] Metal’s symbol,
Named *Yin within Yang*—Yin containing Yang.

Thus, *Kàn*’s *Wén-Guǐ* Water Palace attains *Oneness*!
Moon-metal’s Yang nature—
Externally Yin, internally Yang,
Yin symbolized by White, Yang by Yellow.
Thus, externally white enclosing yellow—
White metal is born from the *Héchē* [河车].
The river is Water, the chariot is Fire,
The red is sand—
Thus, sand is produced from metal—
This is *Yin within Yang* not standing alone.

When sand and lead enter the furnace,
Melting to extract their essence,
They are added to the elixir’s spirit—
This is called *Laonü*.
*Gōu* [勾] sand entering *Laonü* is lead;
Sand is White Metal.

**Secret Key:**
*"One is the Water foundation of the elixir—lead is within it;
Two is the Fire foundation of Wood—its talisman is within it;
Three is the Earth foundation of the Mother—gold is within it.
Thus, the *Huan Dan* cannot establish itself without controlling the talisman and fire’s timing—
How then can it stand?"*

「The five *fán* [矾] and eight *shí* [石] of this world are coarse substances, not fit for the Great Elixir’s use.

The Great Elixir does not employ gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, cinnabar, tin, *zēngkōng* [曾空], male and female sulfur, *pí* [毗], vermilion, quicksilver, furnace soot, dew, mulberry frost, or *rénzhōngbái* [人中白].

Though lead’s hidden *fire* can cure ailments, if taken in excess, it will instead shorten one’s lifespan.

Quicksilver is the essence of Water.
When it ascends in flight, it becomes *liúzhū* [流珠], known as *liúgōng* [流汞].
It is the *son following his father*—quicksilver itself.
Thus, it is said: *vermilion* is the father of lead, and *wùjǐ huángjīn* [戊己黄金] is the mother of the Elixir.

When it condenses into *White Metal*, this is the form born from the One—
the hidden Yang within Yin.

When Water and Metal *Dao* [道] merge,
lead becomes black—
Yin generates Yang within, reversing aging to youth.

What is meant by this?
When *Yin’s essence* reaches its limit, it transforms back.

Thus, quicksilver is born in the North,
but comes to dwell in the Fire position,
where their union forms the Great Elixir.

Those who do not understand use common lead,
black tin, and quicksilver as the *Héchē* [河车],
male sulfur as Earth,
and gold and silver as the One Mother—
these are not the true sources of medicine.

Common cinnabar contains lead,
copper also possesses it,
iron does too,
grasses bear it,
and minerals hold it as well.

The true lead—
how can the *child and mother* be born from the same womb by Heaven’s decree?

Within it, if silver is present,
lead is the root of the Elixir,
*Shénshuǐ* [神水] is the mother of gold,
and the child and mother naturally find their harmony.

Gold is the Elixir’s essence,
dwelling in the Yang position,
quicksilver absorbs the *separating qi*,
responding to the Yin line—
it contains Heaven and Earth’s spirit,
conceives the Sun and Moon’s essence,
where *negation* reaches its limit and *affirmation* follows—
when Yin is exhausted, Yang is born,
all in accordance with the *Dao’s* natural order.

The Sun, from the *new moon’s dawn*,
receives its talisman;
the *six qi* [六气] follow its nature to form its essence,
until the sixteenth day and the thirtieth day complete.
Its *qi* shapes its nature,
and the Moon’s shadow gives birth—
this is the symbol of its rise and fall.

Gold is the *female* [妇];
Wood is the *male* [夫].
*Zhèn* [震] is the eldest son;
*Duì* [兑] is the youngest daughter.
White is the name of returning to the One,
gold is the title of attaining its position.
Black is the nature aligned with Metal and Water,
lead is of the same class as gold.
Yellow is the likeness of Earth,
*ke* [芽] governs growth.
The child is the term for its revolving movement,
the river is the foundation of Water,
the chariot fulfills the talisman’s nurturing function.

The world does not know that *vermilion* is:
the mother of lead, the father of the Elixir,
born from Earth, yet dependent on Earth for death.
Yellow can restrain Water,
so Earth is the mother.

Thus, *vermilion* is the ancestor of lead,
the foundation of the *Huan Dan* [还丹].
Lead is born from vermilion,
quicksilver from lead—
yet none have truly awakened to this.

When *vermilion* absorbs the *Heavenly talisman’s qi* and the nurturing of the *Dao*,
and the Sun and Moon’s influence is complete,
it emerges as *Yánggōng* [阳汞]—
this is the *Yang as sovereign*, the *Yin as subject*.
The two cinnabars are one substance,
though not two separate things.

The Precious Elixir originates
not from two separate substances,
but like a clam absorbing the autumn moon’s glow,
a pearl forms within its belly—
how could anything be created without its kind?
The Great Elixir has three grades:
The highest is called *Water*;
the middle is called *Elixir*;
the lowest is called *Sand*.

Those who awaken to it
return to the One and transcend the One.

*Gold Tiger* [金虎] contains Yin,
its position in the West,
its *qi* hidden within—
it nurtures the *mysterious lead* of *Great Yin*,
becoming the utmost essence.

The utmost essence is the *Dragon and Tiger* [龙虎].
*Mǎo* [卯] and *yǒu* [酉] oppose each other,
*Zǐ* [子] and *wǔ* [午] face one another—
this is the *Heavenly and Earthly Yin-Yang* revolving like a wheel,
the grand transformation of the *Dao*.

Seventeen *xún* [旬] suffice for the Nine Refinements.
A single change of the *cauldron* [鼎] leads to Nine—
its subtlety lies here!

Even without changing, it is possible.
On the eighth day of receiving the talisman,
gold’s nature is subdued yet ascendant;
on the fifteenth day,
gold’s nature is fully extinguished;
by the thirtieth day,
the *Dao* is exhausted,
and it sinks into the *Kūn* [坤] element.

Thus, the three substances receiving the talisman all descend into Earth,
except the Yang talisman, which ascends without lowering.

Then *Qián* [乾] and *Kūn* [坤], *Zhèn* [震] and *Sūn* [巽],
coiling above and below—
the Five Phases are concealed,
Yin and Yang harmonize,
Yin and Yang interact—
this is the *Dao’s* operation,
cycling endlessly.

The secret for crafting the *golden cauldron* [金鼎] is:
*"Posterior Earth, Golden Cauldron,
Life and Death, length seven;
Divine Chamber, three luminaries,
Round the five Yin, one;
Chaos wanders, Heaven and Earth five *lǐ* [里],
Yin and Yang two heads like a parrot—
shape and form must not differ.
Yellow and White within the wrapping,
thickness and thinness must be even.
Six-One firmly united,
well-guarded at the *Wǔmén* [午门],
Parametric harmony naturally achieved.*

The One is the beginning of the Five Phases.
The Sun and Moon’s Yin shadows,
their position in the *Kǎn* [坎] center,
their medicine grows in the *Yīnhuì* [阴晦] lands.

What is *Jīngōng* [金公]?
Gold is called *Great White* [太白];
*Gōng* [公] is the highest rank among substances.
Thus, it is named: *lead*.

When gold enters the *Tàiyī* [太一] palace,
within the *fire’s Gēng* [庚] city,
the *Red Crow* [赤乌] guards the *Yellow Crow*,
the *Azure Dragon* [苍龙] relies on the *White Tiger*—
their kinds gather together—
this is what is called *Parametric harmony*!

Black lead enters the Moon,
paired as husband and wife,
Yang spirit and Yin shadow—
the two naturally harmonize.

The world does not know that the Five Metals and Eight Minerals
are the total count of Yin and Yang,
combining and moving to form the Elixir.
Thus, the Eight Minerals are the Eight *Guà* [卦];
the Five Metals are the Five Phases.

Wood that does not ash is the essence of *Jiǎ* [甲],
subdued by Metal.
Metal conceives Water in tranquility,
Water must preserve Metal;
Wood conceives Fire in restraint,
Fire must depend on Wood.

*Lead Water* is the liquid born naturally within sand,
governing Yang;
*Quicksilver Water* is the liquid extracted from sand,
governing Yin.

Fire is the *symbol* [符].

*Quicksilver Fire* is the union of Water and Fire in form,
the two substances held within the furnace as a *straight symbol* [直符] to subdue them,
so they do not scatter or flee.
When struck by killing *qi* [气], they are consumed and transformed—
thus it is called *Great Return* [大还].

The **Primordial Lord** [元君] says:
*"Cinnabar* [丹砂] and *Water Essence* [水精], when joined with Metal, become balanced,
and the slightest measure suffices—
most sacred and most spiritous indeed."

The *Too Xuan Yin Fu* [《太玄阴符》] states:
The Dao/Way [道] gives birth to Yin,
Yin gives birth to Yang,
Yang gives rise to the Five Phases [五行],
and the Five Phases combine to form the *Elixir of Great Return* [还丹],
thus it is called *Dragon and Tiger* [龙虎].

The Dragon [龙] is Yang *qi* [气];
The Tiger [虎] is Yin *qi* [气].

The positions of Metal and Wood:
Yang arises from the first *Guà* [卦], *Zhen* [震]—Wood [木];
Yin arises from the second *Guà* [卦], *Xun* [巽]—Wood [木].
This is the month of *One* [一].
The month of *One* [一月].

When the two Woods receive the *symbol* [符],
they gradually weaken.

Quicksilver’s refusal to be subdued
cannot yet yield the Great Elixir,
it must be nurtured and held for three years.
Three years is the month of *Three* [三月].

Nurturing Fire for one month
can seize one year’s vital *qi* [正气].
Its hue becomes pale yet luminous,
then it emits venom into the cold spring—
one month later, extract and distill it,
using *paper mulberry* [楮] juice and *paper mulberry* [楮] broth.
Refine it, observing strict purity for fourteen days,
binding oneself while closing the eyes,
striking the teeth thirty-six times before ingestion,
to dispel illness,
to restore youth.
Hold it for five years, consuming three *cù* [铢],
one can attain longevity;
Hold it for nine years, consuming two *cù* [铢],
one can ascend to the heavens.

The **Primordial Lord** [元君] says:
"I possess the Celestial *symbol* [天符],
to be used in crafting the Metal Furnace’s essence.
*Jiǎ* [甲] is the progenitor of Wood and Fire,
its number three, completing the number eight,
its true position born in the *束方* [束方],
lodged in *Bing Ding* [丙丁],
the teacher of all things,
the parent of Fire.

The vital *spirit* [精魄] of the Sun,
the beginning of Yang,
illuminates and shapes the world—
its name is the *Sun Spirit* [日魂].
The Sun [日],
in heaven, is the *straight symbol* [直符],
able to unleash and nourish all things;
on earth, it is the *straight matter* [直事],
able to cook and mature all things."

「The *yang* *qi* [陽氣] is divided and determined,
thus the **Celestial Jade** [青腰] is called the *yang* *jing* [木精] messenger of the two *natures* [二性]—
this is the **mutual verification and harmonization** [契證參同] of *yin* and *yang*.
The **Metal Sand** [金砂] and **Fire Essence** [火并] unite,
three and five returning to one,
and **spontaneous harmony** [同自靈] arises.

The **three** here refer to **Wood** [木],
whose *yang* *jing* [陽精] illuminates and shapes life—
its **formative power** [結立] is strong,
and thus it is **arbitrarily named** [強名] the **Metal Sand** [金砂],
the **refined essence of Heaven and Earth** [天地之精].

**Cinnabar** [丹] is the *yin* **mercury** [汞] of *yang*,
its *yang* **transforms as a subject** [反為臣], the **two** [二].
**Vermilion Sand** [朱砂] serves as its **Fire** [火].

**Lead** [鉛] is the **five** [五],
**Earth** [土] as its **mother** [母],
the *yang* **mercury** [汞] of *yin*,
its *yin* **transforms as a sovereign** [反為君], the **one** [一].

**Black Lead** [黑鉛] is the **foundation of Water** [水之基],
**three refinements of the *yin* *po* [魄]** yield **Yellow Silver** [黃銀],
explaining the **subtle *yang* within *yin* dwelling in the *Kan* position** [坎位，陰中之陽].
**nine refinements of the *yang* *hun* [魂]** yield **True Water** [真水],
explaining the **subtle *yin* within *yang* dwelling in the *Li* position** [離位陽中之陰].

Its name is **Mercury** [水銀],
where **Fire** [火] and **position** [位] intermingle,
**chaotic unity** [混沌] merges,
**restoring and returning to the singular** [克復歸一],
its **formed substance** [成形] has no external limit—
thus it is called **Yin-Fire** [陰火].
**Understanding its symbolic logic** [自會其符理],
it is akin to **human inhalation and exhalation** [人消息],
**aligning with the Dao’s natural flow** [即合天道].

The **Primordial Lord** [元君] says:
**"The highest-grade Gold Elixir** [上品金丹] subdues the mother to conquer the child,
and the child **self-destructs** [自滅].
*Yin* and *yang* advance and retreat—
its **cycle of seven and eight** [其數七八],
**receiving *qi* and separating** [受氣分離],
occurs between **fifteen days** [旬有五日] and **thirty days** [三旬].
When the **Dao is exhausted** [道穷], it **returns to its origin** [在復].
**Nourishment and cultivation reach spontaneous harmony** [養育通靈].

In the **ninth month** [九月],
when **both *yin* and *yang* mercuries** [九个月阴阳二汞] merge into one form,
one must **first harmonize with nature** [先須配合自然],
**aligning the *straight symbol* [直符] with cosmic motion** [交運],
**conforming to the *yarrow stalk* patterns** [依乎爻象].
Then the **Elixir’s essence transforms spontaneously** [丹斯靈化].

The **Primordial Lord** [元君] says:
**"When Heaven and Earth return and restore** [天地返還],
**three and one unite** [三一],
its **movement aligns with the Celestial *symbol* and *formative patterns* [天符法象].
There is also a **method** [決] for this.

The **method of alignment** [行符者],
when the **child’s month** [子之月] is observed,
the *yang* **stalk** [爻] has already moved—
**yet it still generates within the *Kan* position** [初九港龍勿用],
the **divided chaotic *yang* *qi*** [陽氣混沌分判].
After the **Winter Solstice** [冬至], a **single *yang* surges** [一陽衝],
and **at *Jiazi* [甲子] it begins** [為首].
The **upper element** [上元] commences from the **hour of *zi*** [子之時],
thus **two *yang* arise** [二陽生],
**the Dragon appears in the Field** [見龍在田].
When the **stalk moves** [爻動], its **shock and concealment** [驚垫] awaken,
**receiving *yang* to act** [受陽用事],
this is called **one *yang* born** [一陽生].
When it meets **Jia** [甲], it is the **parental principle** [父母].
Thus in the **eleventh month** [十一月], **receiving *yang* to act** [受陽用事],
it **begins from *zi*** [從子而起],
its **born *yang* dwells within the hidden *yin*** [其陽生於陰暗之中].
From **Renwei** [壬癸] to the **month of *Jianwu*** [建午],
**the *yin* born within *yang* aligns with the *yang* mandate** [陽中陰生符諭同陽令].

The **Sutra** [經] says:
**"When initiating the alignment method** [起計行符],
**the *zi* principle governs the weight and measure** [子諭斤兩].

When the **stalk moves at the initial *yin*** [爻動初陰],
its **Fire** [火] is the **Fire of *yang*** [陽火].
The *yin* **dwells within the *yang* *symbol*** [陰寄於陽符],
and its **four hundred and fifty *cù*** [四百五铢] **unite in pairs** [而兩合].

**Sun and Moon’s mysterious patterns** [日月玄象],
the **five phases’ rise and fall** [五行起伏],
**begin with the number of one *yang* born** [其始之數是為一陽生],
**mirroring Heaven and Earth’s unfolding** [象乎天地發揮],
**and penetrating all emotions** [旁通情者],
**shock and concealment emerge as portents** [驚垫萌兆] and proceed in parallel.

The **Sutra** [經] says:
**"Take only the **Spring division** [春之分],
**aligning day and night with the method** [昼夜均時用符],
**the *yang* stalk gradually arises** [陽爻以漸生],
until **Great Strength** [大壮],
**from the new moon to fifteen days** [盖自朔日一至旬有五日],
**mirroring the **Fire-Wood** [火木] dominance of **Spring and Summer** [春夏],
**and the transition from **cultivated** [文] to **martial** [武]."

At **sixteen days** [旬有六日],
**take the **Autumn division** [秋之分],
**aligning day and night with the method** [昼夜均時],
**the *yin* stalk gradually arises** [陰爻漸生],
until the **month of *yin* dominance** [陰盛之月],
**mirroring the **Gold-Water** [金水] dominance of **Autumn and Winter** [秋冬],
**and the transition from **martial** [武] to **cultivated** [文].
**Calculating a hundred *ke* [刻] in total** [并更百刻],
**it corresponds to Heaven’s mysterious patterns and concealment** [應乎天之玄象藏伏],
**its disappearance at the **waning moon** [晦],
**is the number for **uniting the *yin* and *yang* organs** [合眺腑].

The **method’s principle** [符從子起],
**is not the **parental principle of Fire** [火之父母].
**Zi** [子] is the **beginning of a single *yin* stalk** [陰中一爻之始],
**explaining the **weight and measure** [斤兩].
This is the **total count of **Creation’s axis** [造化轴辖],
**the **rise and fall of *yin* and *yang*** [陰陽之起伏],
**where the **alignment method** [行符] **conforms to the water clock** [刻漏],
**and **separating *qi* aligns with weight and measure** [分氣合於斤兩].

The **method’s movement** [符動] **begins at *Chenwu*** [辰巳],
**reaching two and a half cycles** [二周半] **as the **dividing *qi*** [首分氣],
**and ending at *Xuhai*** [戌亥],
**not the **proper position of *zi*** [子之正位].

At the **Winter and Summer Solstices** [冬夏二至],
*yin* and *yang* ascend and descend—
thus **above, the method guards the **Furnace’s essence** [鼎],
**strictly following the **stalk’s patterns** [爻象] for **advance and retreat** [進退],
**and **weight and measure** [斤兩].
However, **one must use *yin* to align with *zi*** [用陰合子],
**covering with charcoal** [依炭覆藉],
**facing *yin* and turning away from *yang*** [背陽向陰],
**its concealment resembling a **bee’s nest** [蜂之穴],
**preventing *qi* from dispersing** [勿使氣泄].

The **Sutra** [經] says:
**"From the Solstice to seven and a half days** [從至第七半],
**it mirrors one season** [即象一季].
**Subsequently, upon encountering *zi*** [以次遇子], **add accordingly** [即加焉].

Since **Zi generates within the *Kan* position** [子生於坎位],
**it illuminates a single *yang* within *yin*** [故明陰中一陽],
**conforming to the *Kan* pattern** [法象於坎] **and beginning from *zi*** [而從子起],
**gradually increasing the stalks** [漸加其爻],
until **Established Summer** [立夏] and **Summer Solstice** [夏至],
**mirroring the **Fire** [火] phase,
until **Martial** [武] **turns contrary** [相背],
**at fifteen days and sixteen days** [十有五日，十有六日],
**calculating the method’s alignment** [計其符],
**a total of sixty** [共當六十].

**Before the full moon** [望之前] is *yang*,
**after the full moon** [望之後] is *yin*.
The **born *yin* begins from seventeen days** [陰生從十有七日],
**uniting with twenty-four days** [合十有四日],
**gradually retreating until the **Winter Solstice** [冬至].
The **Winter Solstice** [冬至] is when
**the five phases’ numbers are exhausted** [五行數盡],
**ending at thirty** [終於三十].
**Calculating the days for alignment** [計其合符日用],
**it follows the **six stalks’ rise, fall, and completion** [六爻上下生成終始之數],
**and aligns with the **five phases** [合於五行].

**First Watch** [初候],
**two and a half days** [二日半] **comprise one *qi* [氣] of thirty *shi* [時],
**two and a half cycles** [二周半] **comprise five *qi* [氣]s,
**dividing and returning through twelve branches** [分還歷十有二支].

**Five cycles total sixty *shi*** [凡五周為六十時],
**the alignment method spans five days** [行符五日],
**each watch utilizing five stalks** [一候當用五爻].

**Second Watch** [第二候],
**two and a half days** [二日半] **comprise one *jin* [斤] of thirty *shi* [時],
**two and a half cycles** [二周半] **comprise five *qi* [氣]s,
**dividing and returning through five cycles** [分還歷於五周],
**totaling sixty *shi*** [為六十時],
**until the alignment method reaches fifteen days** [行符至十有五日].
**Three watches suffice** [三候足矣].
Its **use of fifteen stalks** [十有五爻] **comprises thirty alignments** [三十符].

The **Sutra** [經] says:
**"The first fifteen days are **Yin-Symbols** [陽符],
**mirroring the **Fire-Wood** [火木] dominance.
**The latter fifteen days are **Yin-Symbols** [陰符],
**mirroring the **Metal-Water** [金水] dominance."

At the **beginning of the stalk’s movement** [爻動之始],
**its *yang* is **odd** [奇],
**its *yin* is **even** [偶].
**Uniting at six hundred and forty *cù*** [六十四铢] **and ten *liang* [兩]s,
**two alignments are used** [用二符].
**The initial stalk is fixed** [其初爻為定],
**and upon meeting *zi*** [及乎遇子], **add accordingly** [則加焉].
**When encountering *yin*** [逢陰], **retreat accordingly** [則退焉].
**Cycling and returning to its beginning** [周而復始],
**it conforms to the **Celestial *symbol*’s patterns** [法象乎天符],
thus **commencing from *Jianzi*** [是以建子].

**Dispersal** [發泄] is the **beginning of *yang* movement** [陽動之始],
**as chaos begins to divide** [混沌欲分],
**the **Hidden Dragon** [潜龙] has yet to appear** [未見].
**One must rely on *Jia* [甲] as the **parental principle of *yang*** [陽之父母],
**dividing *qi* belongs to the **Dao of *yang*** [分氣屬陽道].」

The **Supreme Origin** begins its movement, and when the *yang* **marching *symbol*** [行符] is active, it is the **Trembling** [震] and **Returning** [复] that take effect.
Its **manifestation** [象] is the **initial nine** [初九], using **climatic *qi*** [气候] to signify **Early Spring** [孟春].
On the **first day of Early Spring**, the **child** [子] **stalk** [爻] begins at one, the second day at two, the third at three, the fourth at four, and the fifth at five.
Each **marching *symbol*** cycles through the **twelve celestial stems** [十二辰], completing **two and a half rotations** by *si* [巳], totaling **thirty *shi*** [时] **and two and a half days**, beginning from *wu* [午] **time** [时] **to divide *qi*** [分气] again for two and a half rotations, ending at *hai* [亥], totaling **sixty *shi***, thus symbolizing **Middle Spring** [仲春].
Middle Spring belongs to *yang*, and the **five stalks of the Supreme Origin** constitute **ten *symbols*** [符], so the sixth day begins at the **sixth child stalk** [子六爻], the seventh at the **seventh child stalk**, the eighth at the **eighth child stalk**, and the ninth follows the **receptive and decisive *qi*** [坤兑之气] to symbolize **Late Spring** [季春].
Late Spring reaches *si* at **thirty *shi***, marking the **ninth and third** [九三], so the ninth day begins at the **ninth child stalk**, the tenth at the **tenth child stalk**, and ends at *hai* at **sixty *shi***. This is the **seasonal influence** [候] of the Supreme Origin’s activity, and when encountering **divided *qi*** [分气], the stalks are counted from **child to *wu* and *hai*** [午亥], returning to **three seasonal phases** [三候].

**Early Summer** is the *yang* **retreat** [遁] of the **Middle Origin** [中元], with **forty stalks** constituting **two hundred *symbols*** [符] for the **third seasonal phase** [第三候]. The eleventh day begins at the **eleventh child stalk**, the twelfth at the **twelfth child stalk**, the thirteenth at the **thirteenth child stalk**, marking the **ninth and fifth** [九五].
Two and a half days reach *si* at **thirty *shi***. **Middle Summer** begins from *wu* **time** [时] **to divide *qi*** [分气] until *hai*, so the fourteenth day begins at the **fourteenth child stalk**, the fifteenth at the **fifteenth child stalk**, ending at *hai* at **sixty *shi***. Thus, **fifteen stalks** combine into **thirty *symbols***, the **Kingly and Martial** [王武] opposing each other.

**Late Summer** is the *yang* **retreat** [遁] of the **Lower Origin** [下元], where the **metal and water boundaries** [金水二界] face each other, the **sun and moon** [日月] align, and the Supreme Origin **withdraws to await the exchange** [退守交期]. Thus, *yang* reaches its peak while *yin* arises, the **heavenly and earthly pivots** [天地轴辖] align, and the *symbols* wax and wane. This is the **application of the *symbols***.
**Beginning and ending** [终始] rely on **civilized** [文] and **martial** [武], cycling and returning.
Generally, from **child** [子] to *chen* [辰] and *si* [巳], two and a half rotations divide *qi*, beginning at *wu* and ending at *hai*, so *chen* generates within *yin*, and *si* generates within *yang*.
**Trembling and Gentle** [震巽] are the **ancestors of fire** [火之祖], first attaining **harmony with the *symbols*** [符合於信].

**Early Autumn** is **Gentle** [巽], encountering the **fourth seasonal phase** [第四候].
The **upper six** [上六], the sixteenth day begins at the **fifteenth child stalk** [子十五爻], constituting **thirty *symbols***.
The seventeenth day begins at the **fourteenth child stalk**, the eighteenth at the **thirteenth child stalk**, and from the **original time** [本时] **to divide *qi*** [分气] until *hai*, marking the **sixth and fifth** [六五].
The nineteenth day begins at the **twelfth child stalk**, the twentieth at the **eleventh child stalk**, ending at *hai* at **sixty *shi***.
**Middle Autumn** is the *yin* **retreat** [遁] of the **Supreme Origin** [上元], generally using **twenty-two *symbols***, marking the **fifth seasonal phase** [第五候], the **sixth and fourth** [六四].
The twenty-first day begins at the **tenth child stalk**, the twenty-second at the **ninth child stalk**, the twenty-third at the **eighth child stalk**, and two and a half days reach *si* at **thirty *shi***.
**Late Autumn** is the **sixth and third** [六三], beginning from *wu* **time** [时] **to divide *qi*** [分气] until *hai*, so the twenty-fourth day begins at the **seventh child stalk**, the twenty-fifth at the **sixth child stalk**, ending at *hai* at **sixty *shi***.
**Early Winter** is the *yin* **retreat** [遁] of the **Middle Origin** [中元], generally using **twelve *symbols***, marking the **sixth seasonal phase** [第六候], the **sixth and second** [六二].
The twenty-sixth day begins at the **fifth child stalk**, the twenty-seventh at the **fourth child stalk**, the twenty-eighth at the **third child stalk**, and two and a half days reach *si* at **thirty *shi***.
**Middle Winter** is the **initial six** [初六].
The twenty-ninth day begins at the **second child stalk**, the thirtieth at the **first child stalk**, ending at *hai* at **sixty *shi***.
**Late Winter** is the *yin* **retreat** [遁] of the **Lower Origin** [下元], aligning with the **two initial ebb-and-flow *symbols*** [伏之二符]. Two *symbols* constitute one stalk, the **receptive body** [坤体] concealing *yang*, from the first to the fifteenth day, **virtue** [德] attains the **heavenly body** [乾体].

Spring and summer belong to **fire and wood** [火木], autumn and winter to **metal and water** [金水]. The **seventh and eighth** [七八] precede, the **ninth and sixth** [九六] follow. **Rising and falling**, **flexing and extending**, **reversing and returning**, between **eclipse and new moon** [晦朔], the **interaction of sun and moon** [日月交会], symbolizing the **four seasons** [四季], **returning soul and spirit** [归魂归魄], **medicine aligning with the whole** [药就物全], reverting to **natural harmony** [自然]. Thus, **yin-fire and yang-fire** [阴火阳火] are established, **metal and water** [金水] stand parallel, not exceeding the **balance** [斤], conforming to the **Dao of Heaven** [天道].
The **Classic** says: *Yang* is **odd**, *yin* is **even**; one **sovereign**, two **ministers**. The **initial stalk** [初爻] of *yang* movement responds to the **second and eighth** [二八], **spiraling leftward** [左旋] as the *yang* **symbol**. Gradually increasing until **Great Strength** [大壮].
When *yang* reaches its peak and *yin* arises, it responds to the **sixth and eighth** [六八], **spiraling rightward** [右旋] as the *yin* **symbol**, gradually withdrawing to **Return’s beginning** [复之初].
When *yin* reaches its peak and *yang* arises, it cycles and returns.
When the **initial nine** [初九] divides *qi* belonging to the *yin* **Dao** [阴道], the Supreme Origin begins *yin* and **withdraws the *symbol***. Gradually retreating through the **six seasonal phases** [六候], once completed, it returns to the **three decads** [三旬]. The **five phases** [五行] exhaust their numbers, relying on **adding or subtracting fire** [抽添其火], adhering to the **mysterious *symbols*** [玄象] without deficiency. Thus, the **spiritual and numinous** [神灵] naturally align, and the **Golden Elixir** [金丹] is achieved.
One *symbol* is insufficient—then it is like **clay and rubble** [瓦砾].

The **Supreme Sovereign** [元君] says: Those refining the **Great Medicine** [大药] must use **true lead and true mercury** [真铅真汞], **gold and water** [金水] completing each other, **steel and water** [戊己] merging. Like an **infant receiving *qi* from its mother** [婴儿受气於母], the mother conceals the child within the womb, the child hidden in **gold** [金], **naturally pregnant** [含孕自然], the **golden essence** [金精] and **realized liquid** [实液] opposing each other—**one ascends, one descends** [一飞一伏], *yang* **propels**, *yin* **verifies** [阳推阴证]. Like the **mandarin duck’s white exterior concealing yellow** [鹦子外白裹黄], the **Lunar Rabbit’s chariot** [河车] revolves, in an instant **shedding its shell** [脱胎], returning to **unity** [一体]. This is the **foundation of the Elixir** [丹基].
Its essence lies in using **one hexagram per day and night** [昼夜各用一卦], the **interchange of Heaven and Earth** [乾坤互用], **Gentle and Trembling** [巽震] generating creation. The **twelve hexagrams** [十二卦] shift above and below, applying *symbols* and **verification** [符信], thus establishing **five rotations** [五周] **to divide *qi*** [分气].
From **five *zhi* [首] to *hai* [亥], beginning at **child** [子], advancing and retreating stalks, **concealing and emerging** [藏伏时候], aligning with the **Dao of Heaven** [天道], relying on **water clocks** [刻漏], taking a **porcelain vessel** [瓷] of **Great Unity** [大一] size, drilling a small hole at its base, inserting a **black crow’s feather** [乌羽] three to four inches long from the household, securing it with **wax** [蜡], drawing water into the vessel, measuring with **elevated and lowered water clocks** [升斗数马漏刻].

Then **fire is used to seal the talisman**, and it shall not err.

When encountering the **child** [子] in the twelve hours, add it forthwith. After one month, the **symbols of the four seasons** shall manifest.
Guard it for either **nine months or three years**, adhering to the **Nine Periods** [九纪], thus aligning with the **Great Cycle of Nine Rotations** [大演九周], and the elixir shall spontaneously become efficacious.

The **Classical Text** states:
*"Take three-refined lead essence, subtract twice eight—its remainder is Earth. Beneath, place twice eight [of mercury], and their essences shall naturally coalesce.*
When their essences meet, the **two *qi*** [二气] stir and respond—**instantly returning to restrain each other**. Thus, **metal and water** rise and float, merging into **Unity**, and the **metal essence emerges**, named **yellow silver**.

When its essence is fully refined, follow its measure and descend again to transform.
Obtaining the **metal’s parent-child pair**, the **two strings** [二弦] cease. That which departs the parent is called **detached embryo**; that which enters the furnace is called **fire elixir**.

The **furnace vessel** has upper and lower parts—its upper section is of **metal**, its lower of **earthenware**, not the common kind.
The **earthenware vessel** is the **Earth Mother**, sourced from the **sweat pools of Luo and Fen**. Finely ground and sifted, it is mixed with thin glue to form a shape resembling a **phoenix egg**. Its length is seven inches, its diameter five inches, with a central **divine chamber** three inches wide and two and a half inches deep—its form mimicking the **primordial chaos of yin-yang**.

Lead and mercury cannot be controlled without this earthenware vessel; hence, **yellow can subdue water**.
If one uses **parent-metal and earth-mother** to forge the furnace, then **spiritual ascent** may be achieved.

When placing it in the furnace, the **day and hour** must align with **four executions** [四杀], **clashing influences** [刑克], and **yang**. The **hundred measures of day and night** correspond to the **hexagram lines**, rising from **yin at child** [子], through **full and new moons**, **axes and scales** ascending and descending in rhythm, **civil and martial** forces intersecting, cycling endlessly—all in harmony with **spring and autumn**. Thus, from **child to *hai*** [亥] is one rotation.

For **six yang and six yin** begin and end, converging into **Unity**.

**Lord Yuan** says:
*"The talisman is applied through the lines. Water and fire regulate the talisman—six yang and six yin, every twelve branches, shift from civil to martial, or yang wanes while yin dissipates.
Civil first arises from **one line**, like **one yang born in *kan*** [坎].
Martial concludes at **fifteen lines**, like **two yin generated in *li*** [离].
When yang reaches its peak, its law mirrors **Great Strength** [大壮], the talisman cycles in harmony, thus beginning from **child** and counting growth—**six talismans unite** in their application.

It mirrors **one yin line**, with **yang talismans incrementally adding a line**.
From **child to *si*** [巳], it lies dormant in **three**—thus, **chen and *si*** [辰巳] constitute **one *qi***. Hence, **fire is born in *chen* and *si***, retreating to guard **sixty hours**, concluding at **xu and *hai*** [戌亥], then restarting from **child**.

The *Hidden Armor Classic* [《隐甲经》] states:
*'Advancing and retreating meet the **King and Martial** in opposition—this is **yang-*qi** above.
Terminating with **Civil**—this is **yin-*qi** returning below.
After the **winter solstice**, encountering **jia** signifies **yang’s birth**—thus, it ascends.
After the **summer solstice**, encountering **jia** signifies **yin’s birth**—thus, it descends.
Hence, it is said: **"Direct talismans above and below—months possess this."**
Regardless of year or season.*

The **Classical Text** states:
*"From the first watch, **child** initiates the line, concluding at **repetition-child** [复子]—this is the **one line of Heaven’s talisman**, mirroring the **twenty-four *qi*** [二十四气]. Guard it for two and a half days, and **one *qi*** gradually increases.
When the line reaches five days, it is **one watch**; sixty hours later, it reaches **chen and *si***, concluding at **xu and *hai***. From **yin to *shen*** [寅至申] is **seven returns**; from **child to *shen*** [子至申] is **nine revolutions**—one rise, one retreat.
**Thunder and Wind** [震巽] are the **beginning of *jia*** [甲], the **foundation of fire**, the **interchange of the five phases**.
**Heaven and Earth, Thunder and Wind** generate above and below—**the gate of *jia*** [甲]’s prohibition.

The **Classical Text** states:
*'The line moves for two and a half days, dividing *qi* and adding lines until five days complete **one watch**—only two hexagrams are used, aligning with the **mysterious symbols of Heaven’s talisman**.
**Day** is the **Heaven talisman**; **month** is the **yin talisman**; **fire** is the **Earth talisman**.
Regulating talismans by adding or subtracting **days, months, years** depends on the **water clocks’ advance and retreat**; executing talismans by **hiding and revealing** depends on **sequential *qi*** [合气].
In accordance with the **seven luminaries and five phases**, the **celestial balance and lodges**, and the **moon’s waxing and waning**, including **intercalary months**, govern **rise and retreat**.
From **Repetition to Thunder**, then **Wind**, until **Earth** concludes—**yin and yang** must interact in their operations.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Mirror* [《黄帝手镜》] states:
*'Days are calculated like a **chariot wheel’s rotation**.
**Fire** weighs **one hundred and eighty *jin***—this is the **nine-nine number**.
What is **Three Elements** [三元]?
Five days, sixty hours—**Upper Element**; ten days, one hundred and twenty hours—**Middle Element**; fifteen days, one hundred and eighty hours—**Lower Element**.

On **jia-ji** days at midnight, **jia-*zi*** [甲子] is born; on **yi-geng** days, **bing-*zi*** [丙子] is born; on **bing-xin** days, **wu-*zi*** [戊子] is born; on **ding-ren** days, **geng-*zi*** [庚子] is born; on **wu-gui** days, **ren-*zi*** [壬子] is born.

After the **winter solstice**, the first **jia-*zi*** is the **Upper Element**, reaching **wu-chen** [戊辰]—five days, sixty hours—**Upper Element *jia-*zi*** advances as **four *zhong*** [四仲].
On **four *zhong*** days at midnight, **jia-*zi*** advances through **eight palaces**, with **Tianpeng** [天蓬] presiding—**child, *wu*, *mao*, *you*** [子午卯酉].

From **ji-*si*** [己巳] to **gui-*you*** [癸酉], five days, sixty hours—**Middle Element *jia-*zi*** advances as **four *meng*** [四孟].
On **four *meng*** months at midnight, **jia-*zi*** advances through **four, three, two palaces**, with **Tianren** [天任] presiding—**yin, *shen*, *si*, *hai*** [寅申巳亥].

From **jia-*xu*** [甲戌] to **wu-*yin*** [戊寅], five days, sixty hours—**Lower Element *jia-*zi*** advances as **four *ji*** [四季].
On **four *ji*** days at midnight, **jia-*zi*** advances through **seven, six, four palaces**, with **Tianfu** [天辅] presiding—**chou, *xu*, *wei*, *chen*** [丑戌未辰].

The summer solstice marks its reverse course through the **Nine Palaces**, completing a cycle and returning to its beginning, exhausting the **three hundred sixty hours of a month**, and concluding at the **fire’s alchemical stage** and **seasonal correspondences**—mirroring the operations of a year.

**The Method states:**
Take a small porcelain vessel, and at its base, open a hole the size of a bean. Within the cauldron, finely sift and burn the **Steward of the Five-and-Six** (戊己) to form a cover. Use bright, uniformly colored sand as a base, placing it in the vessel, then sealing it onto the cauldron with **Six-One mud** to secure it. Apply charcoal fire beneath. When the porcelain glows red-hot, first plug the hole with a paper wick, then withdraw it. If white smoke arises, this is **mercury**. Replug the hole, and when the **pure white smoke** appears, cease.

Collect **one *tài*** per day, sweeping the porcelain with a **parrot feather**, and store it. If the sand retains a red hue, repeat the process as before. When mercury is fully extracted, the sand will no longer redden.

The Master of Wandering, Zeng Kai, compiled the *Five Phases of Lead and Mercury*:
*"Monthly gather its bloom, daily extract its essence;
The Four Symbols stand complete, the River Chariot moves in motion."*

The Master of Exploring the Mysteries, Cao Shengtu of Yellow Crane Mountain, said:
*"I met Master Yang at Dangyang and received the true essence from him.
Thus I knew that the Great Elixir of Gold and Immortality lies in:
Refining the Five Phases to their utmost,
Then exhausting the principles of sun and moon,
With the Four Symbols fully established,
And the birth of the Five Emperors’ River Chariot.*

*The River Chariot—this is the Divine Water.
It quickens when fire is applied, thrives when water is present,
Enduring ten thousand refineries and transformations,
Unchanging in its truth.
This is the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth."*

The Master of Exploring the Mysteries then sang:

*"Obtain it through the One Qi,
Transform through the Golden Elixir;
The Golden Elixir opens the path to Immortality,
Seeking must be in the Five Phases.

To recognize true lead and mercury,
One water meets one fire;
The Central Palace reveals the master—
Water and fire unite to form substance.

Two substances become husband and wife,
Paired in perfect match;
A hundred moments in Kan and Li,
Cinnabar emerges from here.

Its form like a true pearl’s separation—
Cinnabar is not inherently red;
Encounter water, it returns to water’s essence,
Encounter fire, it becomes Golden Elixir.

Strip the husk, remove the black shadow—
The black shadow is lead’s nature;
The Gold Elixir forbids lead—
Using lead, a thousand times you’ll fail.

When bamboo breaks, mend with bamboo;
When wood snaps, weave with wood;
Human qi supplements the exterior—
All things are but guests;
Thus lead and mercury’s root
Resides in the Five Phases alone.

Gold governs the four—
Born from fire’s receipt of its talisman,
Capable of drawing existence from nonexistence,
And returning existence to nonexistence,
Thus the Four Symbols stand complete,
And the White Gold is conceived.

This is the Qi of sun-essence and moon-bloom,
Capable of congealing into white, of becoming water—
Named *Flowing Pearl Golden Elixir Divine Dan*.
Exhausting the ninety-nine of Yang’s extreme,
This becomes the Elixir of Transcendence.

Wood governs the three—
Born from fire’s initial mingling of Qi and receipt of its talisman.
Containing the utmost essence of the Primordial,
Through Earth’s harmony it abides, becomes parent,
Mutually generating sprouts,
Aligning with Heaven and Earth’s transformations,
Establishing trust, responding to the Jia position—
This is the Green Dragon,
Which congeals summer’s snow to resemble winter’s ice—
This is the way of reversal.

Water governs the one,
Its number residing in the North.
The *Dan Jing* says:
*Heaven births the Dark Female as Yang,
Her extreme becomes Yin, descending from Heaven.*
The lead, silver, sand, and mercury of this world—
How could they align with the Five Phases,
Responding to the Qian symbol?
My mercury—
Encompassing all symbols, pouring into the boundless,
This is the River Chariot.

Fire governs the two—
Born from Wood’s receipt of its talisman.
It is Earth’s father, Gold’s husband,
Water’s wife, Wood’s child.
Thus Heaven and Earth’s immortal nature,
Which all things bear in form,
Averse to death, loving life,
Soaring above the Nine Heavens,
Capable of drawing existence from nonexistence,
And returning existence to nonexistence.
The Sage’s longevity with Heaven and Earth lies in:
Refining one Yin to return to the Yang position—
This is the body of the Returning Elixir.

Refining mercury into dust—
Its form is sand containing mercury,
Lead containing silver.
Li is the female—
Returning to its true nature.

Earth governs the five,
Its virtue reigning over the four seasons,
Nurturing all things, stabilizing the four quarters.
The *Dan Jing* says:
*The Earth produces the Yellow Male—
This is the extreme of Yin giving birth to Yang.*
Earth’s essence is true lead.
Used in harmony, it grants longevity;
Used in opposition, it harms things.

Mercury that does not scatter—
This is the mother of the Flowing Pearl.
With lead as its root,
When the root is complete, the sprout grows;
When mercury is concealed, the Elixir is formed.
Yet it is not external—
Thus my Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth
Are not the common ones of the world.

**True One Chapter**
The Dao’s birth, I grasp its principle;
Embracing the True, holding the Primordial,
Observing the origin of things.

The Master of Wandering said:
*The Dao—
Capable of generating Heaven and Earth,
The divine, the imperial—
The Sage of Old Wisdom said:
I do not know whose child it is,
Prior to the Emperor’s symbol.
For lack of a better name, it is called Dao.
Yet it supports Heaven and Earth,
Directs the sun and moon,
Rotates the four seasons,
Generates all things.
Heaven’s Five Stars,
The Five Divine Emperors,
Earth’s Five Sacred Peaks,
Man’s Five Viscera,
The Five Directions,
Down to the Five Grains, Five Colors, Five Notes—
The Dao is present in all.

Thus the Sage of Old Wisdom said:
*The Dao is born from the One,
The One generates the Two,
The Two generates the Three,
The Three generates all things.
All things, myriad and varied,
Each returns to its root.
Returning to the root is called stillness,
Stillness is called returning to life—
This refers to the source of transformation,
Beginning from the One, ending in the One,
Thus enduring all changes without exhaustion.
If one can penetrate it with the One,
Then the Dao is clear.

What is the True One?
The root of Dragon and Tiger.
Dragon and Tiger’s transformations—
When these are complete, the Elixir is formed.
Uniting Dragon and Tiger,
Returning to the origin, restoring the Primordial,
Preserving both life and nature,
Roaming the cosmos—
This is to illuminate the True One of the Great Dao.

Later scholars also wish to preserve form and dwell in the world—
How can they fail to illuminate the True One of the Great Dao?

Those who do not know the root of Dragon and Tiger’s transformations
Yet are confused by their varied names—
Some say the liver is the Dragon,
The lungs the Tiger.
Those who say the liver is the Dragon
Claim its green hue corresponds to spring,
Assigned to the East’s Jia-Yi Wood.
Where Wood’s vital force generates—
This is called the Green Dragon.
Those who say the lungs are the Tiger
Claim its white hue corresponds to autumn,
Assigned to the West’s Geng-Xin Metal.
Where Metal’s vital force is severe—
This is called the White Tiger.
Thus the bodies of Dragon and Tiger are known."*

Some say the heart is the Dragon, and the kidneys the Tiger.
Those who say the heart is the Dragon—
Claim that the Jia-Yi Green Dragon *qi* can transmit and generate within the heart’s fire,
Thus fire contains Wood, and it is called the **Yang Dragon** (陽龍).

Those who say the kidneys are the Tiger—
Claim that the Geng-Xin White Tiger *qi* can transmit and generate within the kidneys’ water,
Thus water contains Metal, and it is called the **Yin Tiger** (陰虎).

This is how the functions of Dragon and Tiger are known.

To know the Dragon and Tiger’s forms and functions
Yet fail to grasp their fundamental roots—
This is not what I call the **Dao** (道).

The True One (真一), then,
Is my very *qi* and fluids, yet they cannot comprehend it. Why?
For the **Original *Qi*** (元氣) is born between the two kidneys,
Circulating in and out at the **Yao-Ming** (杳冥) threshold—
Inaudible, invisible, its name is called the **Elemental Sea** (元海) or the **Soul Root** (靈根).

Within *qi* arises fluid, within fluid arises *qi*—
*Qi* and fluid mutually generate, united yet inseparable—
This is what is meant by:
**"Heaven’s One generates water, the Great One (太一) embraces the True *Qi*"** (天一生水，太一含真氣).

Scholars, not knowing the Dragon and Tiger’s interplay,
Often invert the **Yin-Yang** (陰陽) and misname them—
They say the Dragon is but the Dragon, the Tiger but the Tiger,
Though they know that fluid transmits to **Li** (離), generating blood in the heart,
And call it the Yang Dragon,
Yet they do not inquire how blood contains fluid,
Holding within it the Yin Tiger’s *qi*.

Though they know that blood transmits to **Kan** (坎), generating essence in the kidneys,
And call it the Yin Tiger,
Yet they do not inquire how essence contains blood,
Holding within it the Yang Dragon’s *qi*.

Those who misname and separate them—
How could it end with just this?

The heart’s fire can be the **Li Girl** (離女), the **Great Sun** (太陽), the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀), the **Astonished Girl** (詫女), the **Red Phoenix** (赤鳳), the **Golden Crow** (金烏), the **Lead** (鉛), the **Red Snow** (紅雪), the **Burning Mountain Talisman** (燒山符), or the **White Horse Sprout** (白馬芽),
Yet all are the Yang Dragon.

The kidneys’ water can also be the **Kan Boy** (坎男), the **Great Yin** (太陰), the **Dark Tortoise** (玄武), the **Infant** (嬰兒), the **Black Turtle** (烏龜), the **Jade Rabbit** (玉兔), the **Mercury** (汞), the **Black Water** (黑水), the **Drinking Sea Turtle** (飲海龜), or the **Red Dragon’s Paw** (赤龍脚),
Yet all are the Yin Tiger.

They merely muddle their theories with myriad classifications.
If they are confused by external appearances,
And fragment the true source—
Then their teachings will drift aimlessly, finding no proper foundation.

The enlightened practitioners of the **Five Phases** (五行) and **Four Symbols** (四象) can harmonize with them,
And those of the **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) and **Nine Palaces** (九宮) can discern them.

Thus, they regulate the **fire’s ascent and descent** (行火候之抽添),
Unite the **flow and counterflow of Yin and Yang** (合阴陽之順逆),
Adjust the **Cauldron of Heaven and Earth** (按乾坤之鼎器),
Refine the **essence of Sun and Moon** (煉日月之精華),
Unleash the **subtle beginnings of Transformation** (發造化之幾微),
And grasp the **core secrets of the Elixir of Great Reversion** (得還丹之要妙),
Then they may indeed tread within the realm of **eternal life and prolonged vision** (長生久視).

The **Yellow Emperor** (黃帝) said: *"The cosmos lies within my grasp, transformation within my body."*
How fitting his words were!

I have observed the **source of cultivation and refinement** (修煉之源),
It is not dependent on **five metals and eight stones** (五金八石),
Nor does it lie in **swallowing mist and absorbing *qi*** (吞霞采氣).
Its essence lies in **qi generating fluid** (氣生液),
Fluid transforming into **blood** (液化為血),
Blood transforming into **essence** (精) (blood化為精),
Essence forming into **pearl** (精化為珠),
Pearl becoming **mercury** (汞) (珠化為汞),
Mercury turning into **sand** (砂) (汞化為砂),
And sand finally yielding the **Golden Elixir** (金丹).

The **Yellow Emperor** said: *"Heaven and Earth are the thieves of the myriad things;
The myriad things are thieves of humanity;
Humanity is the thief of the myriad things.
Yet when these three thieves vie in action,
It is humanity alone that suffers their harm,
For it cannot properly nurture life."*
(天地，萬物之盜；
萬物，人之盜；
人，萬物之盜。
然三盜競起，而人獨受其弊者，
蓋不能善攝生故也。)

Those who **master the nurturing of life** (善攝生者),
Their **spirit is whole, their essence restored** (神全精復).
If one understands the **true unity of the Great Dao** (大道之真一) lies within **qi and fluid** (氣液),
Refines **qi and fluid** to generate the **Yang Dragon and Yin Tiger** (龍虎),
And unites the **Dragon and Tiger** to achieve **transmutation** (變化),
So that the **Nine Returns to Seven** (九還) and **reversion to the undifferentiated** (七返) lead to **mixed unity and true return** (混一歸真),
Then the **spirit is whole, essence restored** (神全精復),
And what difficulty remains?

I have heard from the **secrets of the Golden and Jade Elixir** (金玉還丹之訣):
*"The origin of the **Pivot of the Great Medicine** (刀圭大藥) is indeed rooted in **qi and fluid** (氣液)."*
Is this not what I speak of as **true unity** (真一)?
(此豈吾所謂真一者欤！)
**The Orthodox Unity Scripture** (正一篇)

The **Orthodox Unity Master** speaks:

*"When **qi** is drawn from the earth and congeals through water,
Each movement and stillness—**qi** surges upward.
The five directional **qi** align in matching pairs,
Their exchange returning to **Oneness**.
**Oneness** is the root of the Great Dao,
The gateway to all transformations.

When lead retreats, mercury revives;
When gold reverses, water yields its essence.
When water irrigates the yellow sprout within the earth,
It is not born in the spleen—
But **qi** sensed in the earth condenses in water,
Circulating endlessly, beyond measure.

Inner and outer elixirs share the same essence and function.
Movement is Heaven; stillness is Earth.
Each movement and stillness—**qi** is born.

This **surge-qi** is the essence of the Great Elixir.
Let it lead and follow—never delay.
Within, a maiden dwells, yet fire is not concealed;
Her fiery essence blazes thick, illuminating the void,
As Heaven and Earth’s myriad forms unite in a single realm.
Nine unions, nine revolutions—separation and reunion brief—
She ascends to the Purple Palace,
Twisting her pure intestines,
Refining her yin soul,
One elixir, one mystery—yet they do not suffice.

The **Geng-Wu** pair, their trinity converging,
Naturally abstains from grains—
Their intestines hold no dross.
So long as dross remains, **true qi** will not respond.
When it does, like a hollow valley without sound,
Yet voices heard within.
With time, like a jade bell’s resonant hum,
A maiden’s voice emerges, delicate and clear.

My body—master of ten thousand spirits,
From which all spirits arise.
If men do not leak their essence,
And women conceal their blood,
Within the twelve seasons’ span, no stagnation occurs—
At noon, something will come to meet it.

At the **Zi** hour, both reside in the yang organs;
When yin meets yang, when yang meets yin,
One inverted, one aligned—
Their arrival runs deep.
As within yin, a Tiger hides.
The Dragon’s heart is yellow, the Tiger’s hide black—
Unseen, they conceal the true jade.
At the **Mao** hour, the nine-nines stand;
At the **You** hour, they rise—
This is their essential law.

What did the Great Emperor mean by ‘flickering substance’?
A single point of essence.
I possess three treasures—
One abides, one revolves, until nine revolutions complete,
Then the child’s gate opens, flying into the brain.
Within the brain, a jade spirit platform faces the elixir field.
The elixir field does not bar the sun and moon’s path;
An original spirit enters and exits through it,
Thus called the **One-Furnace Elixir**, refined by nine fires.

**The Two Passages Scripture**
Above and below, the two passages—
Where **qi** circulates.
Within lies the jade vulva,
Its key to be mastered.

The **High Exalted Master** said:
Strip to the waist, sit upright on a thick mat,
At the **Zi** hour, regulate the breath’s inflow and outflow,
So that **qi** harmonizes and the spirit settles.
Then clasp the hands, pressing with the tips of the thumbs
At the **structural throat** (喉结),
Drawing **qi** gently through the nose and closing it.
Next, part the thumbs and press the carotid pulses beside the throat,
Moving the middle fingers to the **heavenly pillar** (天柱骨) at the nape,
Drawing strength from it.
Gradually tighten the thumb pressure on the pulses,
Until at maximum force, the breath grows stifled—
Then swiftly release the thumbs.
This is one **passage**.

Adjust the breath again, waiting for **qi** to settle,
Then repeat as before—
Nine passages daily.
After several days, during practice,
The fingers will detach themselves,
The head will sway as if dizzy or falling.
Do not support it—
Supporting it would disrupt the **qi**.
In seclusion, a golden wheel appears above the head,
The spirit brightens, old ailments vanish,
The body feels light and at ease.
This is the sign of **original qi** ascending past the brain’s gate,
All passages now open.

Its name: **Detached Fingers, Mystic Passage**.

At the **Zi** hour, loosen the garments, sit upright,
With middle fingers tracing below the lower abdomen,
Outside the yin, within the thigh—
Where the horizontal veins pulse.
Press with all strength, as a warrior would,
Drawing **qi** gently through the nose and closing it.
When the breath reaches its limit, swiftly release the fingers,
As with the upper passage.
Nine passages daily—or three.
With time, harmonious **qi** naturally descends,
Entering the two thighs like hot water,
Old ailments vanish.
These two passages regulate the spirit and command **qi**.
First master the openings—
Then effects come swiftly.
The more practiced, the better.

**The Three Elements Scripture**
To regulate the six **qi**, do not block the three elements;
Cease thought, settle the spirit—
This too is the gate of life.

The **True White Master** said:
Man has three elements—
If the three are blocked, the six **qi** will乱.
The **Upper Element** belongs to all above the head;
The **Middle Element** spans from the head to above the navel;
The **Lower Element** spans from the navel to above the waist.

To settle the harmonious **qi** of the elements,
First remove the **spirit’s fur**—
The **spirit’s fur** is the nose.
Cease all thought, settle the spirit,
Day and night, regulate the breath—
Let it be subtle, for subtlety is the gate of life,
While excess is the path of death.
Why?
Drawing through the nose while exhaling through the mouth—
This is inverted **qi**.
Regulate it subtly—
Excess becomes yin **qi**, drawing original **qi** to harm.

Beginners may indulge in wine and meat,
Their mouths filled with toxic **qi**,
Or damage their organs—
The nose inhales it, the mouth exhales it,
Thirty or twenty passages,
Exhaling gently—never forcefully.
The nose cannot be easily opened or closed.
Let the breath be subtle—
Never force exhalation.

Forced exhalation will bring illness to the five **zàng**-organs and six **fù**-organs.
If you forcibly close it and it does not exit, it will suddenly burst forth—
Then it becomes coarse and panting, great and unrestrained.
Thus, even when exhaling **qi**, one must not let it run wild.
If the mouth opens wide, **qi** will rush forth, and the original **qi** will be depleted.
Though the nose inhales **qi**, it must not be forcibly closed—
Forcing closure will make the breath urgent.

Among the Three **Yuán** (origins), the **Middle Yuan** is the most honored.
The *Bao Pu Zi* says:
*The heart is the sovereign; intention is the minister; **qi** is the people.*
When thoughts are extinguished and all notions cease,
The original **qi** rises naturally.

As for those who first practice the Way,
And immediately turn inward to seek the **Xuan Zhu** (Mysterious Pearl),
It is like seeking fish from green wood—I have never seen one who succeeds.

In my own practice of cultivation,
When my hundred joints are blocked and I fall ill,
I can focus on the **Middle Yuan**,
Ignite fire to burn it away—
In moments, it will open, and opening brings healing.

The heart is the **Jiang Gong** (Vermilion Palace).
The **Jiang Gong** is the color of fire.
I preserve the blazing fire of the heart,
Spanning my entire body—
Not only does it circulate the **qi**,
But it also consumes the yin evils within.

When eyes are closed and teeth are struck,
The spirit is stored in the Eight **Gua** (Trigrams),
Left and right hands clasped firmly to seal the **qi**,
With intention imagining the fire of the **Middle Yuan** to burn the body—
Once done, the **qi** is moved,
Guarded at the **Lower Yuan**.

In ancient times, Guang Cheng Zi used accumulated fire to burn the Five **Dú** (poisons).
The Five **Dú** are the five grains and five flavors.
If not burned, they will obstruct the **qi**-paths.
Burning them cannot be prolonged—
Prolonged, it brings weariness.
Thus, one must move the **qi**,
Its method being to extinguish all thoughts,
Letting the spirit dwell subtly in the **Ru** (abode)—
Then the original **qi** will naturally permeate the body.

The original **qi** resides in all hundred joints and orifices.
Once it permeates the body, it must stand still and settle,
Cutting off all thoughts—
If thoughts are not cut off, the spirit cannot be preserved.

The method of attaining stillness lies in the **Lower Yuan**!
In the **Lower Yuan** **Dan Tian** lies the **Xuan Zhu**.
Its form is round and luminous.
I can illuminate within,
Preserving the pearl’s shape in the **Qi Hai**,
Then make the **qi** inhale and exhale,
Circulating one by one around the pearl—
When inhalation is complete,
It moves yet remains still,
In the space between clarity and confusion,
Naturally forming and resting in the **Qi Hai**.

Thus, the **Middle Yuan** nourishes the pearl of the **Lower Yuan**,
And the original **qi** becomes settled.

The **Middle Yuan** is yang, is masculine;
The **Lower Yuan** is yin, is feminine.
The *Huang Ting Jing* says:
*Know the masculine and embrace the feminine,
Know the white and embrace the black.*
This is what is meant.

Why?

The method of guarding the **Middle Yuan** over the **Lower Yuan** lies in the **Left White** and **Right Black**—
when they merge into one,
the heart becomes clear and the mind focused,
without thought, without deliberation,
then stillness arrives naturally.

Thus, the original **qi** becomes settled.
External **qi** does not enter,
internal **qi** does not escape—
harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,
its life knows no bounds.

The Yellow Emperor instructed the **Wang Xiang** to seek the **Xuan Zhu** in the **Chì Shuǐ**.
The **Chì Shuǐ** is blood;
the **Xuan Zhu** is **qi**;
**Wang Xiang** is the state of profound stillness, without thought, without concern.

Thus, the **Xuan Zhu** cannot be attained through mere silence—
this is why the **Dao** lies within the **Xuan Jī**;
when the **Xuan Jī** departs, the body remains;
when the **Xuan Jī** abides, the body dies.
Only when there is no **Xuan Jī** does the chest become pure white,
and one may speak of transcending and ascending with ease.

In the **"Sān Zhù" Chapter**:
The essence of **transformation** relies on **qi** as its foundation;
when the **qi** does not flow, form and spirit both abide.

The **Huá Yáng Zǐ** said to **Shǒu Wú**:
"The *Great Yì* does not say that refined **qi** is matter,
and wandering spirits are change.
Thus, within all forms, what is preserved
is none other than the original **qi**.

When the original **qi** abides, the spirit abides,
when the spirit abides, the form abides—
if these three abide, life rests in me,
why should it rest in Heaven?"

Thus, one knows that humans are born from **qi**,
and **qi** is sustained by the spirit.
Human **qi** is like fish to water—
lose the water, and death follows.

Yet, the spirit is the child of **qi**,
**qi** is the mother of the spirit,
and the form is the dwelling of the spirit—
this is the great principle of **cultivating the body**,
the root of **preserving the form**.

I have observed the function of **qi**:
like mist and clouds arising from the four limbs,
like sunlight and moonlight illuminating the **chì shè** [residence of the vital essence].
Next, I observed the stillness of the spirit:
a hundred evils cannot disturb its uprightness,
all movements cannot perturb its clarity.

The *Tài Píng Jīng* says:
"The spirit is the **Dao**.
Entering, it becomes divine clarity;
exiting, it becomes poetry and art—
these are the small accomplishments of the **Dao**.

In my former days at the **Míng Chǎng** [world of fame],
my thoughts labored endlessly;
now, without thought, it arrives naturally—
is this not the power of the **Dao**?

The **Yǐn Zhēn Rén** said:
"Extend the heart to govern **qi**,
let **qi** merge with the spirit—
when the center has its master,
the body will endure forever,
like the sun and moon revolving through Heaven,
and Earth’s ceaseless motion.
Thus, life may be endless."

The **Huá Yáng Zǐ** said:
"I have inscribed this:
The original **qi** and refined essence can preserve all forms,
my **qi** sealed within,
my body in lasting peace.
In the **Sì Shén** Chapter:
The **golden gate** and **jade door** hold a **mystic seal**;
following the **shùn** [natural order] of time,
one attains **sainthood**.

The **Tài Yáng** is the **shùn** of Heaven’s symbol,
moving leftward within,
containing the **qi** of wind and thunder—
this is the **Qīng Lóng**,
this is the **Zhū Què**.

The **Qīng Lóng** is the producer of **natural daylight essence**,
which descends to the **Lí** position below.
The **Zhū Què** is fire,
consuming and refining the **gǔ shí** [grain and food];
it corresponds internally to the **spleen**,
its **qi** spreading to the four directions,
its root residing in the **Kūn** position.
The **daylight essence** is **mercury**.
**Mercury** resides in the **Lower Dan Tian**;
the **Lower Dan Tian** is the **Yuan Yáng** [original yang] **essence sea** of humanity.
Because of its **Kūn** position,
**Tài Yīn** [original yin] is thus generated.
The **Tài Yīn** is the **earthly qi** rotating rightward,
also known as **water**—
this is the **Xuán Wǔ**,
this is the **Yuè Huá**.

Why is it called the **Lower Tian Mén**?
Heaven’s **qi** descends,
penetrating the four limbs,
all converging toward the **Lí** position,
where below there lies a **hole**,
named **Gǔ Shén**—
connecting above to the **Ní Wán** [brain marrow] **official**.
This is called the **holy gate**.
Within the **golden gate** and **jade door**,
there is the **mystic seal**—
the *Scripture* says: 'The root of Heaven and Earth.'
Is this what it refers to?

The **Sūn Zhēn Rén** said:
"From **Zì** to **Gān**, the **yang** numbers conclude;
from **Chǒu** to **Kūn**, the **yin** numbers are complete.
When **yang** advances and **yin** retreats,
they regulate the four seasons,
illuminating the waxing and waning of the five phases—
the principles of **cultivating the True** are none greater than this.

Thus, the two **qi**s can internally produce **natural white mist** with you.

When **daylight essence** and **moonlight essence** are refined,
they are called **Sì Xiàng** [Four Symbols],
also known as **Sì Shén Dān** [Four Immortal Elixir].
What is their method?

To ingest the **yang** **qi**,
gradually adding **leftward rotation** to the root’s position,
merging with Heaven and Earth,
naturally breathing—
this is the lesser effort.

From the hour of **Zǐ** to **Chǒu**,
victory is achieved.

The **yin** **qi** is **jing** [essence].
It is named **Chà Nǚ** [Astonished Maiden],
using the **Sān Chē** [Three Wheels] method
to transport it to the **Ní Wán** **official**,
thus, the **south and north** [yin-yang] **intersect**,
the **Four Symbols** are complete,
the five phases harmonize in cycle,
the eight **guà** [trigrams] arise naturally,
and the nine palaces align with Heaven and Earth’s **creative transformation**.

In its initial practice,
stir the **Tian Guān** [Heavenly Gate],
producing sweet dew below,
and proceed with full intent—
awaiting the **surging liquid** to flow upward,
this is the **Huá Chí Shén Shuǐ** [Divine Water of the Flower Pool].

What are the effects of the **yang** **qi**?
The **daylight demon** is already defeated.
The **killing qi** surges toward Heaven,
and in five days, the **navel** below gradually lengthens,
the waist and spine become unobstructed,
and the **front and rear** [orifices] function smoothly.
In three months, the **navel** below expands.
All impurities within the **navel** are removed.
After six months, the expansion continues—
adding to the sixth and seventh months,
the expansion is a **drainage and transformation**.
The **root of illness** and **noxious worms** all emerge.
At nine months, the expansion continues again,
and the **blood descends**—
like the droppings of a parrot.
At eighteen months, the **old skin** peels away like bran,
the **external kidneys** are suppressed and ache,
until three years, when the abdomen feels like a **pile** [hemorrhoid].
This is the **root of the illness** seeking release.
Or, if the body becomes **withered**,
it is the **gǔ qi**, **wind qi**, and **yin qi** desiring to emerge.
From the abdomen to the waist,
and throughout the entire body,
the pain connects to the heart.
This is the **response of the medicine**.

There are no restrictions on food and drink—
after one year, the **abdominal pouch** grows long,
and the body becomes light and agile.
In the **third vertebra** on either side, if there is **coarse dissolution** and heaviness,
it is the **yin poison** of the five **zàng** [viscera].

Or a **sore** may form in the mouth,
or the body may grow coarse and rough,
or the beard and eyebrows may fall and droop.
This is the **response of the medicine**—
with practice, it heals in five days.

After two years, hair and hairline wither and fall;
with time, the body becomes smooth and luminous.

What are the effects of **yin qi**?
If the tongue is sometimes stiff,
it is the **sign** of **yang qi** in motion.
At six years, the body grows cold—
this is the **sign** of **earth qi** ascending.

Or, if after five days or six days,
the joints of the bones ache,
it is the **sign** of the **three hundred and sixty bone joints** expanding.
After a hundred days, the body becomes light,
the **body fluids** grow sweet,
the two **kidneys** quiver,
and the area below the **navel** feels like boiling water.

In two years, the **head** increases by seventy-two bones,
and the **anterior and posterior waves** emerge—
like the **jelly of a bean** or **peach**,
which, when exposed to **fire**, becomes **body fluids**,
and can be used as a **great medicine**.

By three years, the body is light and agile,
as if without form,
and **cold and heat** cannot penetrate it.

The *Classic* says:
*"Open its **fui** [mouth], close its **men** [gate],
and it will never falter all its life;
block its **fui**, and it will fail to complete its task,
and never be saved all its life."*

Thus, the adept at **closing** [men] has no need for locks,
and the **six bandits** [evil influences] cannot breach it.

This is the **holy water**—
the **gold within water**.
Refining it through **fire** repeatedly,
this is the **earth**—
without **earth**, one must not act rashly.

**Five Precepts Section**
The harm of **imperfect life** is nothing greater than **desire**;
to preserve the **true essence** [shén], one must guard the **celestial field** [tiāngǔ].

The **Pure Yang Master** Lü Dongbin says:
*"The **celestial yang** [heavenly yang],
the **terrene yin** [earthly yin],
the **qi of things**,
the **human nature**,
the **foundation of Dao/Way**,
the **source of virtue/power**,
the **ancestor of the body**,
the **root of life**,
the **form of the dragon**,
the **shape of the tiger**,
the **name of essence-blood**,
the **first of lead and mercury**—
when the **soul** appears, it becomes **three**,
when the **spirit** meets, it becomes **seven**;
this is the **true source of unity**.*

Within my body,
refine the **elixir field qi** [dāntián qì],
and generate the **natural spirit** [zìrán shén]
within the **twelve time-periods** [shí].
Guard the **true essence of unity** [tiānzhēn yīqì],
enter the **palace of the elixir field** [dāntián gōng],
where **internally there is no thought**,
and **externally there is no intention**—
neither exiting nor entering,
neither going nor coming,
the **spirit** steadies and finds peace.

This is the **method of true unity**.

The **preserver of life** is **authenticity** [zhēn];
the **entrance to emptiness** is **spirit**—
when **inner and outer** merge harmoniously,
the **embryonic spirit** [tāilíng] is nurtured.
Scholars who do not understand this
and perish in **other sects** are truly lamentable.

The **Dao of preserving life and attaining spiritual emptiness** lies in:
extinguishing **emotional attachments** [qíng’ài],
removing **hatred and aversion** [zēngwù],
guarding the **true essence** within the **celestial field**,
circulating the **three luminaries** [sānyuè] in the **Red Courtyard** [Chìtíng],
and thus regulating the **five types of qi** [wǔqì].

The **Eight Trigrams** gather their **numinous essence** [líng] at **Mao-Wei** [the hours of 5–7 AM and 5–7 PM],
and the **Nine Heavens** align their **degrees** [dù] with **day and night** [zhòuyè].
In nine years, one may attain **non-action** [wúwéi].

I have **five precepts**—
these are the **foundations of the Great Dao**:
**Cease all thought and deliberation** [juésī lǜ],
and daily preserve **inner qi**;
**Avoid all desires** [jiè wànyù],
and daily preserve **heart qi**;
**Moderate tastes** [bó zīwèi],
and daily preserve **blood qi**;
**Return the body fluids** [huán jīnyè],
and this is **nurturing the embryonic root** [yù línggēn];
**Guard the celestial field** [shǒu tiāngǔ],
and this is **settling the embryonic spirit** [ān tāishén].

**Five Phases Section**
The **trigrams of the Nine Heavens** [zhōutiān gǔ]
must be followed to **perform their functions** [xínggōng],
and the **marvels of the Five Phases** [wǔxíng]
are put to use in **accumulation and nourishment** [túnméng].

The **Master of Wandering** says:
*"There is no greater Dao than the Five Phases."*

**Water** is born in **Shēn** [the hour of 9–11 PM],
reigns in **Zǐ** [the hour of 11 PM–1 AM],
and is stored in **Chén** [the hour of 7–9 AM],
so **Shēn, Zǐ, Chén** are the **domain of water**.

**Fire** is born in **Yín** [the hour of 1–3 AM],
reigns in **Wǔ** [the hour of 11 AM–1 PM],
and is stored in **Xiū** [the hour of 9–11 PM],
so **Yín, Wǔ, Xiū** are the **domain of fire**.

**Metal** is born in **Wèi** [the hour of 3–5 PM],
reigns in **Yǒu** [the hour of 5–7 PM],
and is stored in **Chǒu** [the hour of 1–3 AM],
so **Wèi, Yǒu, Chǒu** are the **domain of metal**.

**Wood** is born in **Hài** [the hour of 11 PM–1 AM],
reigns in **Mǎo** [the hour of 5–7 AM],
and is stored in **Wèi** [the hour of 3–5 PM],
so **Hài, Mǎo, Wèi** are the **domain of wood**.

The **domain of earth** is the same as that of **water**.

At the time when **one yang first stirs** [yīyáng chūdòng]
and **kidney water begins to generate** [shǒngshuǐ shǐshēng],
one should **loosen the clothes** [pī yī], **sit upright** [duānzuò],
and **grasp and store the spirit** [wògù cúnshén].
Circulate the **metal essence** [jīng] in the **muddy pellet** [níwán],
and **brew and refine** [zào niàng] in the **marrow sea** [suǐhǎi],
performing this **elbow-post function** [zhìzhǒu gōng],
for **Zǐ** [11 PM–1 AM] is the **domain of water**.

Though **water** daily **moistens and descends** [rùn xià],
at the time of **Zǐ**, when it reaches its **peak of reign** [wángjí],
it **returns and contains the true qi** [fǎn hán zhēnqì],
and **ascends the stream** [sù liú] to become the **morning sun** [zhāoyáng].

At the time when **one yin first generates** [yīyīn chūshēng]
and **heart fire is about to blaze** [xīnhuǒ yù fén],
one should **clasp hands and circle feet** [dié shǒu pánzú],
and **settle the tranquil spirit** [ān jìng shénshí].
Transmit the **true unity** [zhēnyī] to the **elixir platform** [dāntái],
and **transform the jade nectar** [yuèyè] in the **blood sea** [xuèhǎi],
performing this **intercourse function** [jiāohé gōng],
for **Wǔ** [11 AM–1 PM] is the **domain of fire**.

Though **fire** daily **flares and ascends** [yán shàng],
at the time of **Wǔ**, when it reaches its **peak of reign** [wángjí],
it **returns and covers the true nectar** [fǎn méng zhēnyè],
and **descends the qi** to **return to its root** [guīběn].

At the time of **Chǒu** [1–3 AM],
when **spiritual water descends** [shénshuǐ xiàjiàng],
one should **stir the tongue** [lǚshé] at the **upper throat** [shàngyè],
and **beat the jade nectar** [gǔ yǎn yuèyè] in the **pharynx** [yàn],
sending it down to the **heavy palace** [zhònglóu],
passing through the **liver and gallbladder** [gān dǎn]
and arriving at the **heart** [xīn],
performing this **nourishing-water-and-refining-nectar function** [yǎngshuǐ liàn yè],
for **water is diseased at Chǒu** [shuǐbìng yú chǒu],
and **Wèi, Yǒu, Chǒu** are the **domain of metal**.

**Metal** can generate **water**,
and is stored at **Chǒu** [1–3 AM].
Since **Chǒu** is adjacent to **Zǐ** [11 PM–1 AM],
it **unites with water** [hé shuǐ],
making **Chǒu** the place where **Zǐ’s water** is hidden.

At the time of **Wèi** [3–5 PM],
when **heart fire descends** [xīnhuǒ xiàjiàng],
one should **breathe nasal qi softly and continuously** [nǎiqì miánmián],
**absorbing more and exhaling less** [duō rù shǎo chū],
and **simmer and refine the nectar and blood** [pēng liàn yèxuè],
transmitting them to the **Yellow Courtyard** [Huángtíng],
passing through the **lungs and diaphragm** [fèi fǔ]
and returning to the **kidneys** [shèn],
performing this **nourishing-fire-and-harvesting-medicine function** [yǎnghuǒ cǎiyào],
for **fire is diseased at Wèi** [huǒbìng yú wèi],
and **Hài, Mǎo, Wèi** are the **domain of wood**.

**Wood** can generate **fire**,
and is stored at **Wèi** [3–5 PM].
Since **Wèi** is adjacent to **Wǔ** [11 AM–1 PM],
it **unites with fire** [hé huǒ],
making **Wèi** the place where **Wǔ’s fire** is hidden.

At the times of **Xiū** [9–11 PM] and **Hài** [11 PM–1 AM],
when **heart blood transmits to the kidneys** [xīnxuè chuán yú shèn],
and **yin qi** is sensed to **transform into essence** [gǎn yīnqì huà jīng],
this is the **extreme of yin flourishing and yang declining** [yīn shèng yáng kuī],
the **opportune moment for gathering fire and harvesting medicine** [jùhuǒ cǎiyào].
One should **adjust the breath and store the spirit** [tiáoxī cúnshén],
**close the mouth and swallow the qi** [bìkǒu yànqì],
and **gently press the abdomen** [wēi zǐ fù].
When one feels **heat in the navel and kidneys** [rè shèng],
then **lightly raise the body** [qīngjǔ shēntǐ];
if the heat is not yet intense,
gradually increase it,
until the **essence-blood returns to its origin** [huán yuán].

This is the **function of restraining yang at its pass** [lè yáng guān],
for **Yín, Wǔ, Xiū** are the **domain of fire**.

The fire of **Yín and Wǔ** is stored at **Xiū** and gathered there.
**Xiū** is adjacent to **Hài**, and wood is born at **Hài**,
for within **Hài** lies the **qi** of wood,
which can generate fire—
thus, it can rescue fire at **Xiū and Hài**.

Some say: *"The twelve celestial stems of the Daoist cycle contain only gold, earth, and wood, with no explicit water or fire. If not through extraction and supplementation, what sustains their alchemical refinement?"*

It is replied: *"The twelve celestial stems themselves embody the extracted and supplemented forms of water and fire. The art of extraction and supplementation lies in the moments of **Lún** and **Méng**—
clarified through the **Lún** and **Méng** hexagrams.

**Kǎn** is water.
Its first transformation is the **water marsh** node, its line at **Sì**.
Its second transformation is the **water-thunder** hexagram **Lún**, its line at **Yín**.
If one employs the **Lún** hexagram for extracting water,
then **Yín** is used.

**Lí** is fire.
Its first transformation is the **fire mountain** hexagram **Lǚ**, its line at **Chén**.
Its second transformation is the **fire wind** hexagram **Dǐng**, its line at **Hài**.
Its third transformation is the **water-fire** hexagram **Wèijì**, its line at **Wǔ**.
Its fourth transformation is the **mountain-water** hexagram **Méng**, its line at **Xiū**.
If one employs the **Méng** hexagram for supplementing fire,
then **Xiū** is used.

Thus, the twelve celestial stems’ application lies in **Lún** and **Méng**—
either extracting water to supplement fire,
or extracting fire to supplement water.
Hence, the subtleties of the Five Phases and the functions of alchemical refinement
are all contained within this.

---

From the *Seven Spirits Chapter* of the *Inner Canon*:

The words of the *Inner Canon* are vast and profound;
the five viscera and seven spirits hold their mysteries within.

**Qíbó** said: *"The five viscera harbor seven spirits, each with its domain.
What is meant by ‘domain’?
It is the human **spirit-qi**—
the liver harbors the **hun**,
the lungs harbor the **pò**,
the heart harbors the **shén**,
the spleen harbors **yì** and **zhì**,
the kidneys harbor **jīng** and **zhì**.

Why does the kidney alone harbor two?
It is not all the kidney.
The left is the kidney,
the right is the **Mìngmén** [Gate of Life].
The **Mìngmén** is where all spirits reside,
where the **yuánqi** [primordial qi] is anchored.

Thus, in males, it stores **jīng**,
in females, it secures the **bāo** [uterus].
Hence, it is known that the kidney has one domain.

The lungs are the covering of the viscera.
The heart is the essence concentrated among the five viscera.
The eyes are its orifices.
The heart governs the vessels,
the vessels govern the skin,
the liver governs the sinews,
the spleen governs the flesh,
the kidneys govern the bones—
this is what is called the domains of the five viscera.

Prolonged gazing injures the blood,
prolonged standing injures the **qi**,
prolonged sitting injures the flesh,
prolonged standing injures the bones,
prolonged walking injures the sinews—
these are called the five labors that cause harm.

A hundred ailments arise from **qi**:
anger sends **qi** upward,
joy slackens **qi**,
sorrow dissipates **qi**,
fear sends **qi** downward,
cold contracts **qi**,
heat disperses **qi**,
startle scatters **qi**,
labor exhausts **qi**,
excessive thought stagnates **qi**.

When the nine **qi** are not in harmony,
what ailments can arise?

*The Seven Returns Chapter*

Gold is affected by fire, fire is subdued by gold;
when their proper measures are met, the Yang is preserved while the Yin is lost.

The True Person of Hengyue, Chen Shaowei, said:
When gold is affected by fire, this is called *dan* (elixir);
when fire is subdued by gold, this is called *gong* (mercury).
Thus, *dansha* (cinnabar) is the utmost essence of the Supreme Sun,
the very substance of gold and fire.
When *dan* interacts with fire’s essence and the timing is complete,
and when *gong* blends with its original nature and remains whole,
they form the primordial *xuanyuan zhengzhen qi* (the pure and true essence of the Dark Origin).

The Seven Returns and Nine Reversions—different names, yet the same principle.
*Return* means cinnabar becoming gold;
*Reversion* means cinnabar returning to *dan*.

Some say:
The Seven Returns—*dansha*, belonging to fire,
transforms into gold through change.
Fire’s complete measure is seven;
seven transformations correspond to the utmost Yang Origin.

When *dansha* is refined#1 and obtained,
and fire is subdued to produce white silver—this is the First Return.
Taking one *liang*, all ten thousand ailments are removed.

When white silver is transformed to produce *dansha*,
and fire is subdued to produce yellow flower—this is the Second Return.
Taking one *liang*, the body harmonizes, the spirit clears,
and one returns to youth from old age.

When yellow flower silver is transformed to produce *dansha*,
and fire is subdued to produce green gold—this is the Third Return.
Taking one *liang*, one becomes empty and tranquil, emotions forgotten,
and the heart aligns with the utmost essence.

When green gold is transformed to produce *dansha*,
and fire is subdued to produce yellow gold—this is the Fourth Return.
Taking one *liang*, the body shines luminously,
penetrating both exterior and interior.

When yellow gold is transformed to produce *dansha*,
and fire is subdued to produce red gold—this is the Fifth Return.
Taking one *liang*, the transformations of nature cannot alter it,
and ghosts and spirits cannot perceive it.

When red gold is transformed#2 to produce *dansha*,
and fire is subdued to produce red gold—this is the Sixth Return.
Taking one *liang*, one is not drowned by water nor scorched by fire.

When red gold is transformed to produce *dansha*,
and fire is subdued to produce purple gold—
thus, the true Yang essence and primordial *yuan qi* are complete.
Then, with purple gold transformed back into *dansha*,
and fire applied twice in refinement,
one attains penetrating brilliance—this is the elixir of Reversion, the Seventh Return.
Taking one *liang*, form and spirit unite,
ascending beyond the Nine Heavens.
Taking nine *dans*, one attains the rank of True Person.

The method requires observing the timing every five days,
three observations constitute one *qi*,
combining the eight nodes and twenty-four *qi*—
this makes one hundred twenty days,
the period of the flying and hidden fire’s timing.

In general, one observation suffices for flying and hiding.
Within five days, four use *kan* (water),
and one uses *li* (fire).
Using *kan* means boiling with water;
using *li* means employing seven *liang* of charcoal,
always beneath the tripod.

There should always be seven *liang* of ripe charcoal, neither added nor reduced.
This is the flying Yang fire,
thus five days constitute one cycle.

**The Chapter of the Eight Precious Essences:**
The *Huaguang* tripod, sealed with six;
Nine revolutions of flying essence, emerging from the Eight Trigrams.

The True Person of *Taiji* said:
The Most High possesses the Nine Revolutions of Flying Essence,
the method of the Eight Precious.
In ancient times, Ge Xiansheng, Li Baba, and the Pang Family all practiced it.

The Wandering Scholar said:
Some obtained it from the *Yuju* furnace in Chengdu’s earth.

The method states:
Two furnaces, each holding one *dou* seven *sheng* half,
made of earth.
Once formed, seal them with *liuyi* mud,
let it dry in shade for ten days.
Then use the same mud again—
thus five times seven times.
The method for *liuyi* mud:
Powdered *mǔyè* (oyster shell), white stone pitch, mica powder,
magnetite, red stone pitch, and red ash—each two *jin*—
mixed with sour wine to form mud.
Add two *jin* half of paper, knead evenly.
The initial mud layer on the furnace should be one to two *fen* thick;
after five times seven applications, it should be one *cun* three *fen* thick.

The two furnaces are joined,
with three *fen* left exposed for drying.
Then seal them again with *liuyi* mud—
this is the *Taiyi Zhonggong Huaguang* tripod.

The second use of *liuyi* mud:
Powdered *qiāndān* (lead cinnabar) and *tiānjiāngzi* (celestine),
each two *jin* half,
and one *jin* half of ash-soaked paper—
mixed with sour wine to form mud.

Then select a remote mountain peak with flowing water,
and build the *danshi* (elixir furnace) so the water encircles it.
The *danshi* chamber:
length four *zhang*, width three *zhang*,
dug four *chi* deep, with three doors facing south and west.
The furnace’s mouth and face are curved.
The furnace is nine *cun* high,
constructed on the *bìzi* day, using arms and fine soil,
ensuring no gaps—
its height is nine *cun*, its top flat.
Once the mud dries, place the divine furnace within.
The furnaces are joined—one inverted, one upright—
four sides apart by nine *cun*,
modeling Heaven and Earth,
with twelve *shi* (hours) marked.

The four-six arrangement corresponds to *xū* (the trigram for earth);
the three-seven arrangement corresponds to *hài* (the trigram for water).

「The eight-two arrangement corresponds to *zǐ* (the trigram for water);
the upright nine arrangement corresponds to *chǒu* (the trigram for earth);
the twelve arrangement corresponds to *yín* (the trigram for thunder);
the eleven arrangement corresponds to *mǎo* (the trigram for wood).

Now, what are these medicines called?
Mercury (三斤) is the **Tàiyáng Liúzhū** (太阳流珠), the head of the **Xuánwǔ** (玄武), and the essence of *kǎn* (the trigram for water);
Male yellow (雄黄, 二斤) is the powder of **Gōuchén** (勾陈), the essence of *xùn* (the trigram for wind);
Cinnabar (朱砂, 五斤) is the **Tàiyīn Shén guāng** (太阴神光), the marrow of the **Zhūquè** (朱雀), and the essence of *lí* (the trigram for fire);
Sulfur (硫黄, 六两) is the **Zhōnggōng Téngshé** (中宫腾蛇), and the essence of *kūn* (the trigram for earth);
Northern indigo (北亭, 八两) is the powder of the **Bái Hǔ Suǒlín** (白虎索林), and the essence of *qián* (the trigram for metal);
Female yellow (雌黄, 八两) is the powder of *gēngxīn* (庚辛), and the essence of *duì* (the trigram for lake);
Alum (消石, 一斤八两) is the **Qīnglóng Jiǎyǐ** (青龙甲乙), and the essence of *zhèn* (the trigram for thunder);
Male white (木律, 八两) is the powder of **Tàibái** (太白), and the essence of *gèn* (the trigram for mountain).

Once pounded, they are further ground into fine powder.
First, spread **Tàibái** (太白) powder in the elixir furnace,
then layer **Qīnglóng** (青龙), then **Gēngxīn** (庚辛),
then **Bái Hǔ** (白虎), then **Yáng Lǜ Bì Téngshé** (扬绿碧腾蛇),
then **Zhūquè** (朱雀), and finally **Gōuchén** (勾陈),
filling it until level.

Pour the mercury into the mouth of the divine furnace,
seal the furnace’s lips with lead and cinnabar mud,
then cover and tightly seal it.
Use **Liùyī** (六一) mud to seal its exterior—
one inch thick with three *fēn* (分) divisions,
dried in the shade—
and on the day of *xū* (戌), move the divine furnace into the **Chǒng** (宠).
On the **Chóngyáng** (重阳) day,
at the hour of *yǒu* (酉), as dusk falls,
ignite the fire below.

The charcoal is cut into fist-sized pieces,
burned six inches beneath the furnace.
When the fire reaches the **Jiǔfú** (九伏) stage,
add more until the flames reach the furnace’s belly,
burning again until the **Jiǔfú** (九伏) stage,
then add more until the flames reach the furnace’s top,
burning once more until the **Jiǔfú** (九伏) stage,
before finally intensifying the fire at the sealing point.
For ten days, increase the fire daily—
thirty-six days in total—
thus completing ninety days and nights of burning.

Wait until the fire extinguishes,
then on the seventh day at the hour of *mǎo* (卯),
remove the furnace.
When it has cooled,
observe the **Líng** (玲)—
then nine-colored flying crystals will appear.

Use the feathers of a male peacock (*Yīngyīng*) to sweep the furnace,
then remove and grind it into powder.
One *liǎng* (两) of this powder is one dose.

Store it in a golden bottle,
submerge it beneath cold springs to dispel the heat’s toxicity.
After thirty-seven days, retrieve it,
placing it in a silver container,
which is then wrapped in leather.

Place it within steamed rice,
boiling approximately five *dǒu* (斗) of rice.
After more than ten days, remove it,
dry it in the shade to dispel the moisture’s toxicity,
then grind it again after two or three days.

This is the **Tàiyī Bāqióng** (太一八琼).

For those who wish to take it,
on the **Shàngyuán** (上元) day, bathe and purify oneself,
then use water infused with five scents to prepare the dose.
Tie the hair forward, clench the teeth nine times,
kneel, and pray:
*"Return me to my eternal form,
Restore me to my divine nature,
And fulfill this life."*

Sit in the **Lìwáng** (立亡) position,
ascend upon the white clouds,
soaring through the eight extremes,
reaching the golden gate in the west,
and ascending to **Fúshāng** (扶桑).
I have tasted the essence of the sun and moon.

Again, it is said:
*"Swiftly, swiftly, as the laws command."*

Thus, one may mix a single *chú* (铢) of the preparation with wine—or well-bloom water will also suffice.

When the dose reaches three servings,
the aged will return to infantile complexion,
the Six Palaces (六府) will glow with clarity,
the Three Fields (三田) will remain forever pure,
and water cannot float them, nor fire consume them—
they may then ascend and fly through the void.

The *Jiǔxiān Piān* (九仙篇) states:
The noble one discerns the subtle,
the Three Worthies (三士) nourish the hidden,
the carriage-driver holds the axle,
the cloak-wearing one shakes the collar.

The **Illustrious Master of Clarity, Leaf Fashan** (光辩天师叶法善), also said:
*"Those who cultivate longevity must avoid*
*scattering their thoughts, avoid vexation,*
*avoid attachment, avoid idle fancies,*
*avoid greed, avoid licentious desires,*
*and avoid dissipation—*
*only then may they succeed."*

The **Master of Water’s True Essence, Lao Gongyuan** (水元真人罗公远), also said:
*"Students of the Dao must first*
*kneel and strike the teeth,*
*to gather their spirit (神),*
*then visualize their Three Souls (三魂),*
*and assume the form of a true immortal.*
*This is the blessing of my body’s spirit (福神).*
*If the spirit is restless, illness arises;*
*if the spirit is scattered, death follows."*

The Illustrious Master of Clarity said:
*"Water and fire are the great medicines*
*of the ancient sages.*
*They are not found externally,*
*but reside within our own bodies.*
*The heart is fire (火), corresponding to *Lǐ* (离);
*The kidneys are water (水), corresponding to *Kǎn* (坎).*
*Thus, those who forge the Golden Elixir (金丹)*
*must rely upon the Dragon and Tiger’s water and fire.*
*First, cool the Kǎn-gate (坎户),*
*like water, then descend the Dragon and Tiger.*
*Then, regulate their interplay with measured degree,*
*and apply them with precise count.*
*Extinguish the heart’s fire,*
*and burn it to cure all ailments,*
*to replenish the void and the spent."*

The **Six Passages Master, Jìxíng** (六通国师一行), said:
*"For minor afflictions, use water—*
*do not wish to offend the kidney’s store (肾藏).*
*Maintain singular focus and guard it strictly,*
*and in seven days, all maladies will vanish.*

*For grave afflictions, use fire—*
*fire emanates from the heart,*
*descends into the left and right feet,*
*ascends to the left and right arms,*
*and reaches the head and eyes.*
*When fully kindled, it circulates nine times,*
*each breath encompassing the whole.*
*This is the so-called Fire of the Circulating Heaven (周天之火).*

*Fire has four forms:*
*There is the Fire that consumes the body (焚身火),*
*visualized as rising from the heart below,*
*to the pass of *Guānsuǒ* (关锁),*
*its radiance blazing,*
*fulfilling the count of nine nines—*
*it may then expel the Three Vermin (三虫).*

*There is the Fire that vanquishes darkness (敌阴火),*
*visualized as arising from the yin below,*
*and burning through the whole body,*
*fulfilling the count of three threes.*

*There is the Fire of the Spirit Tortoise (灵龟火),*
*where three flames ascend from its lower part,*
*to the Kǎn-gate (坎户),*
*then split into two paths,*
*left and right, following the inner soles,*
*to the toes—*
*five paths emerge,*
*and merge in a leftward spiral,*
*three revolutions, gradually expanding,*
*until they reach below the waist.*
*Then the Fire that vanquishes darkness*
*draws the Spirit Tortoise’s Fire,*
*and they combine in a rightward spiral,*
*three revolutions, gradually expanding,*
*until they reach the crown.*
*Then, nine points are struck upon the head,*
*and the former method is repeated nine times.*

*There is the Fire that subdues demons (降魔火),*
*for those with great illness nearing death—*
*then, with breath steadied, one sits,*
*as in the Spirit Tortoise’s method,*
*and leftwardly spirals,*
*to burn all demons."*

The **Master of Eternal Essence, Yǒngyuán Zhēnrén**, said:
*"When using fire, it is the heart’s fire (心火).*
*It descends to the left and right feet,*
*ascends to the hands and the crown,*
*and within a single breath,*
*nine revolutions are completed.*

*When using water, one visualizes*
*the black *qi* (气) of the two kidneys,*
*like smoke ascending straight to the crown,*
*filling the *Níwán* (泥丸),*
*transforming into water to wash it,*
*descending to the kidneys,*
*entering the Five Viscera (五藏),*
*and reaching the feet.*
*Having done this,*
*one lifts the feet,*
*and with intent, visualizes it returning to the kidneys.*
*For those with paralysis or festering sores,*
*first, it enters the large intestine,*
*and naturally, the limbs will move.*

The Illustrious Master of Clarity said:
*"The original intent of the Mysterious (冥) is above the nose,*
*not a single thread clinging to the heart.*
*The Gate of the Dark Mother (玄牝之门),*
*all matters are abandoned,*
*and one departs from their base perception,*
*with breath steadied, neither exhaling nor inhaling."*

The Master of Eternal Essence said:
*"The Gate of the Dark Mother (玄牝之门)*
*is where the nose and lungs converge,*
*and the inhaling and exhaling must be firmly guarded*
*to achieve stability.*
*From the nose to the brow,*
*from the brow to the crown,*
*then from the crown to the brow,*
*from the brow to the nose,*
*from the nose to the brow,*
*from the brow to the crown—*
*each three times,*
*and each day, perform this nine times,*
*until the count of eighty-one is fulfilled.*

*Why refine seven times seven (炼七至七)?*
*After forty-nine days,*
*one must naturally stabilize.*
*One period of seclusion (伏) without exhaling or inhaling.*

The Six Passages Master said:
*"Having established the method of stability (定法),*
*then cultivate the visualization of its origin (本).*
*The Mysterious Spirit (灵冥) resides*
*within the Golden Hall and Jade Gate (金堂玉阙),*
*as my own form—*
*when thoroughly observed,*
*then visualize the crown opening,*
*and yellow clouds emerging.*
*From the spleen’s upper part, they ascend,*
*and strike open the forehead at the crown.*
*Within a single breath,*
*this is done seven times—*
*three sets in total.*
*The left side opens upward,*
*The right side opens downward,*
*thus it is said: the yellow clouds fill heaven and earth."*

The Master of Eternal Essence said:
*"When the yellow clouds rise and strike,*
*men must strike left and cover right,*
*women must strike right and cover left.*
*When visualizing the sacred body’s emergence (高想圣身之出),*
*men press with the hand upon the right,*
*forcing it downward,*
*women press upon the left."*

The Illustrious Master of Clarity said:
*"Seven times seven (一息三七撞),*
*twenty-one revolutions per day,*
*until two lunar cycles (二旬),*
*when the yellow clouds may emerge."*

The Six Passages Master said:
*"I visualize my Mysterious Spirit (灵冥),*
*ascending upon the yellow clouds,*
*opening the crown,*
*sitting within the clouds,*
*and with utmost effort, returning to the crown.*
*With the crown sealed inward,*
*I re-enter the Golden Hall and Jade Gate (金堂玉阙),*
*visualizing its emergence and descent,*
*repeating this process many times,*
*before departing the body.*
*Then, the yellow clouds remain,*
*covering the crown,*
*and I ride upon the clouds,*
*looking down upon my form,*
*cultivating without relent,*
*until forty-nine days,*
*when a shape will appear,*
*like ink on water.*
*At eighty days,*
*its coming and going will be natural and unrestrained."*

Once the crown is opened,
the top gate is unlocked,
and warmth spreads both above and below.

The Illustrious Master Guangbian said:
*"One may practice this while lying down—
this is called the Sleep Method.
Its departure is like falling asleep,
its return like waking.
Cultivating the Dao must await the rise of yang energy,
and one must not dissipate it,
allowing the yang qi to act naturally.
Thus, when the first yang arises,
one should practice in a quiet chamber,
abandoning all green thoughts,
and visualize the five viscera’s deities—
the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Turtle—
those vague and distant figures in the void.

The True Man of Heavenly Purity spoke:
*'The crown stores the Great Sun—
why forty-five cycles?
Is this the method of swallowing the luminous essence of sun and moon?*

At dawn, when the sun first rises,
sit facing east,
visualizing the sun as a chariot wheel,
gradually approaching until it reaches the mouth—
then swallow it seventy-two times.
Let it descend to below the navel,
using the River Vehicle to reverse its ascent
until it enters the crown.
After seventy-two days,
one may then harvest the moon’s luminous essence.

Each month, after the eighth day (upper crescent),
sit facing the moon at dusk,
visualizing its luminous essence entering the mouth—
swallow it eighty-one times.
Cease after the twenty-third day (lower crescent).
Await the next month’s upper and lower crescents to repeat this.
After eighty-one days,
this is called *loading the sun and embracing the moon.*

I have another method:
At the *mao* hour (5–7 AM),
sit facing east, visualizing the sun as a bright mirror,
gradually approaching until it reaches the nostrils—
draw it in through the Mysterious Feminine,
letting it descend to the abdomen,
then reverse it with the River Vehicle.

At noon,
sit facing west, visualizing the sun as a suspended mirror,
tilting the head back to draw it in through the nostrils
into the Mysterious Feminine,
then reversing it with the River Vehicle.

As the sun sets,
sit facing west, visualizing it approaching,
drawing it in through the nostrils
into the Sea of Essence,
then reversing it with the River Vehicle
until it reaches the crown’s rear.
In the second and eighth months,
at night,
visualize the moon as a mirror,
descending into the nostrils
until it reaches the Sea of Essence.

Or, when the sun rises,
sit facing east, visualizing it,
drawing it in through the nostrils without forcing—
lest the *ling* qi enter.
Repeat this forty-nine times each month.
This is the *jiu-wu* number.
Use the River Vehicle as a pillow.
The sun is used but not the moon—
the moon is yin, and thus avoided.

The True Man of Eternal Unity said:
*The sun is the spirit—
belonging to yang—
thus true immortals have no shadow,
being purely yang.
As for drawing it in through the nostrils without forcing—
this is indeed subtle!

Or, without using the River Vehicle,
let it enter the Mysterious Feminine
until it reaches the crown,
then bow three times upward.
Do this forty-five times daily,
from the first yang’s emergence
until the Spring Equinox—
this is the yang number.

The Illustrious Master Guangbian said:
*The sun is yang,
yet it employs the yin number—
eighty-nine, seventy-two.
The moon is yin,
yet it employs the yang number—
nine-nine, eighty-one.
This method is purely yang,
thus it uses forty-five days.
Without the River Vehicle,
it follows the Heavenly Dao’s leftward rotation,
from the Mysterious Feminine’s gate to the crown’s rear.

The Six Passages Master said:
*Below the eyebrows lie the five conduits—
the eyes.
They are named:
Blood Wheel, Qi Wheel, Water Conduit,
Metal Wheel, and Pupil Conduit.
Those who awaken within stillness
refer to the breath entering stillness and acting.

The True Man of Eternal Unity said:
*Within stillness, circulate water and fire through the eyes.

The Six Passages Master said:
*The Dragon-Tiger Elixir has three forms:
The first is to swallow one drop of saliva as the Tiger,
and one breath of qi as the Dragon.
Let the qi enter the Sea of Essence,
ascend to the Mud Pill,
and draw down heart-fire to refine it,
covering it with spleen-earth—
this is the Four Deities’ Elixir,
also called the Two-Qi Dragon-Tiger Elixir,
the Minor Circulation Elixir,
or the White Gold Elixir.
It can fortify the lower elixir field
and strengthen the Sea of Qi.

The second method:
Send the swallowed essence to below the navel,
above the Sea of Essence’s water surface,
forming a pill the size of a marble—
do this three times.
Use heart-fire to refine it,
covering it with spleen-earth.
Each pill requires three Dragons,
three Tigers,
three Fires,
three Earths—
twelve cycles correspond to the twelve hours,
nine pills to the nine regions—
this is the one-hundred-eighty number.

The third method:
As before, enter stillness,
and when the eyes flash,
saliva will naturally rise like ice and snow,
entering the mouth.
If it first descends from the mouth’s corner,
visualize it as the Tiger.
Then, within stillness, let the eyes flash again—
fire sparks will descend,
visualize these as the Dragon.
Thus, the Dragon emerges from fire,
the Tiger from water.

When the five viscera interact,
first let the Tiger reside in the mouth,
then emit the fire Dragon.
Why?
The descending fire is swallowed from the left,
reaching the spleen,
transforming into the Dragon,
exiting the liver’s right,
entering the left,
then descending to the spleen,
circling three times to the right—
this is *plowing the spleen.*

The descending water is swallowed from the right,
reaching the lungs,
transforming into the Tiger,
exiting the spleen’s left,
entering the right,
descending to the spleen’s right,
circling once to seed it in spleen-earth—
this is *coming and going without leaving the earth.*

The True Man of Eternal Unity said:
*The eyes’ five wheels contain King Fire and King Water—
water is the harder to obtain.
Thus, first flash the water,
letting it descend into the mouth,
then flash the fire downward
into the liver.
The liver is wood,
its color green—
thus the Azure Dragon.
Water enters the lungs.
The lungs are metal,
their color white—
thus the White Tiger.

The Dragon descends from the left,
reaching the liver,
piercing the liver and exiting to the right,
then returning to the left.
The Tiger descends from the right,
reaching the lungs,
piercing the left lung and exiting,
then returning to the right.*

This is what is called the *interchange of the five viscera’s qi*.

Master Guangbian said:
*The Azure Dragon first descends by day;
the White Tiger acts only by night.
The Azure Dragon belongs to Yang, with twenty-four degrees in the day;
the White Tiger belongs to Yin, with thirty-six degrees in the night.
Thus, the day’s work is forty-six degrees,
and the night’s work is forty-nine degrees—
plowing and sowing above the spleen,
and nurturing the yellow sprout.
The yellow sprout is the root of life.

Master Yongyuan said:
*My body is like a cauldron.
Pressing my left foot upon my right,
and my left and right hands upon my body,
I empty myself like a tripod cauldron.
Concentrating my heart’s blood to cover it,
I then imagine and form a child.
Like my own form, at first it is like a sparrow’s egg,
with head, eyes, hands, and feet all present—
gradually growing larger,
kneeling and sitting within the sea of essence,
crossing my hands behind my shoulders,
raising my face and opening my mouth for two *shi*,
taking the yellow sprout grown above the spleen
as the food for the sacred embryo.

Master Guangbian said:
*The sacred embryo is not sought from without;
imagine the kidneys emitting essence-qi,
entering the sea of blood,
congealing and forming it.

Master Liutong Guoshi said:
*Those refining the sacred have a method.
Imagine the left kidney as the sun, emitting white *qi*;
the right kidney as the moon, emitting red *qi*.
Thus, the white *qi* enters the sea of essence,
transforming into the form of red fire;
the red *qi* enters the sea of essence,
transforming into the form of white water.
The sun and moon’s *qi* form the sacred body,
until within the sea, the red *qi* of the sun,
like fire, ascends to the spleen,
illuminating the body—
then turning over, entering the sea of essence and sitting,
once more imagining rising from the moon,
as before.
Again, rising upon the sacred body,
emitting light to illuminate it,
then turning over and entering the sea of essence—
so from *mao* to *wu*,
stepping upon the sun’s shadow a hundred times.
Each breath is one cycle—
this is the *embryonic breath*.

Master Yongyuan said:
*The left and right sun-moon *qi*,
gradually rising,
until reaching the Golden Hall and Jade Gate,
then covering the crown—
with the forty-five days’ worth of collected solar essence
to illuminate it.
The sacred embryo, illuminated by the sun,
should be immersed in water,
its light entering the five viscera—
all within a single breath,
thirty-six cycles per *shi*.

Master Liutong Guoshi said:
*Refine the spirit by day, release it by night.*

Master Yongyuan said:
*When the sacred body is complete,
by night it rises from the sea of essence,
riding purple clouds to the Golden Hall and Jade Gate,
observing each detail from crown to sole—
then imagining it exiting through the crown,
riding the purple clouds to stabilize the breath.
At the breath’s limit, it descends into the Golden Hall and Jade Gate,
then opens the breath again.
Repeating this fourty-nine times as it exits,
after ten months,
there will be two bodies—
their form identical,
able to leave the body and go where intended.

Master Guangbian said:
*When exiting,
from one step to ten steps,
then twenty, forty,
a hundred days to travel ten thousand *li*—
this is the Earthly Immortal.

Master Liutong Guoshi said:
*Stabilize the breath and refine the kidney’s *qi* for a hundred days.
From *mao* to *wu*,
as before, a hundred cycles.
By night, imagine the kidneys have two black *qi* paths,
entering the sea of essence,
transforming into black clouds—
the child rides them,
ascending to the left ear and exiting the right.
Each breath is one cycle of exit and entry—
nightly, thirty-six cycles,
a hundred days to become the Water Immortal.

Master Guangbian said:
*What is the Daoist sword of the immortals?
First, gather the essence of sun and moon,
then stir the heart-fire to forge it.
Sun and moon are the kidneys.
Thus, the lungs are the wind-horse,
the liver the furnace-coal,
the spleen the earth-mold,
the gallbladder the whetstone.
Within a single breath,
the method forms itself.

Master Liutong Guoshi said:
*Refining the five viscera’s essence begins with the kidneys.
Imagine black *qi* rising within them,
congealed and exiting through the ears—
as large as a canopy—
returning at the breath’s limit to the kidney palace.
Day and night, eleven cycles,
then after eighty-one days,
refine the liver.
The liver has green *qi*—
imagine it exiting the crown,
also like a canopy.
Its color is emerald-green;
returning at the breath’s limit to its viscera—
eighty-one cycles,
then after eighty-one days,
refine the heart.
The heart has red *qi*—
as before in number,
then refine the spleen.
The spleen has yellow *qi*—
as before in number,
then refine the lungs.
The lungs have white *qi*—
as before in number.
When the five viscera are complete,
the five *qi* rise together,
emerging from the crown in five colors,
their light illuminating a room—
thus one may ascend to heaven.

Master Yongyuan said:
*Refinement occurs in the seventh month,
when Water is born—refine the kidneys;
the tenth month, Wood is born—refine the liver;
the first month, Fire is born—refine the heart;
the fourth month, Metal is born—refine the lungs;
Earth rules the seasonal months—
according to the four seasons, refine the spleen.
Each *qi* requires eighty-one days.*

**#2 Transformation:** Originally *"Flower"* (改 from *辑要* as *"Transformation"*).
**#3 Say:** Originally *"Mouth"* (改 from *辑要* as *"Say"*).

**Dao Gun** Scroll Thirty-Two
*Arriving at the Wanderer’s Zeng Xuan’s Collection*
*Parametric Agreement’s Upper Chapter*
*Same Chapter, Different Words—some shallow, some profound;
Measure against Heaven and Earth, then one knows its intent.*

The Dao generates **One**,
**One** generates **Two**,
**Two** generates **Three**,
**Three** generates the myriad things.
*Thus, the principle of medicine is complete in this!*

Who can know the Dao’s beginning?
Only **Fuxi** can do so.

Therefore, there is the **Great Change (易)**—
the **Original Beginning’s (元始)** *qi*,
the **Transformation’s (造化)** function.

Thus, at the **Primordial Chaos (混沌)**,
the **Mysterious Essence (玄素)** nurtures within,
holding **True Essence (真精)**—
able to embrace what it embraces,
its nature unfathomable!

Water flows, moistening;
Fire adheres, drying.
If a person can penetrate the Dao,
the Dao also **penetrates the person**.

When **human** and **Dao** are harmonized,
this is called a **Sage**.

The **Mysterious (玄)** is the person’s unclouded state.
Truly, one does not know it can **nourish white gold (金)**.

When **One Yang (一阳)** dwells beneath **Five Yin (五阴)**,
it is the **Initial Nine (初九)**—the **Hidden Dragon’s (潜龙)** position.

**Mysterious Function (玄功)** returns to **One**,
and the myriad things are born from it.
Thus it is said:
*The kidneys are the **Supreme Pole (太极)**.*

Dwelling in the interplay of **Yin and Yang (阴阳)** while able to **transform and nurture (化育)**,
none surpass the **Sun and Moon (日月)**.
The **Sun and Moon** are the **Supreme Change (太易)**,
the **Ultimate Medicine (至药)**,
the **boundaries of Yin and Yang (阴阳之邪郭)**.

Thus, **Yin and Yang (阴阳)** embrace and nurture,
producing **white gold (金)**,
the **Dao of One**’s origin.

The **Mysterious** governs the **calm spirit and soul (静神魂)**;
when the spirit and soul are still,
**penetrating clarity (通灵彻视)** is achieved.

Once the **forms of things (物象)** are established,
this is called **Primordial Chaos (太初混沌)**.
When **One** *qi* is divided and unified,
this is called **True One (真一)**—
thus the **Nine and Two (九二)** manifest the **Dragon in the Field (见龙在田)** symbol.

The **Classic** says:
*Obtaining **One**, all affairs are complete.*
Thus, **True One (真一)** is the essence of the **marrow within bones (骨之髓)**,
the **virtuous maiden (淑女)** of *Guān Zhōu (关睢)*.

Therefore, those who achieve **True One** have
**jade-like substance and golden resonance**—
this is what **True One** refers to.

From **non-being (无)**, it generates **being (有)**;
from **being (有)**, it returns to **non-being (无)**—
the **root and foundation (根蒂)** of **Elixir Reversion (还丹)**.

If one seeks to forge the **Ultimate Medicine (至药)** yet does not know **True One (真一)**,
I have not seen one who succeeds.

To refine it,
one must examine the **Five Phases’ (五行)** essences.
Thus, **white gold (白金)** and **yellow sprouts (黄芽)** are the **medicine’s mother (丹之母)**.

**Mercury (汞)** compensates **gold (金)**—
not in the form of **mercury (汞)**,
but rather **golden petals (金葩)** condensed into liquid,
embracing **One** and holding **True Essence (真)** to escape the **Five Phases (五行)**.

Therefore, there is the **Great Origin (太始)**.
**One** governs **Fire (火)**,
**Two** governs **Earth (土)**.
The **South** is **Li (离)**, thus it governs **Fire (火)**.
Fire can generate **Earth (土)**—
without a fixed form,
it resides in the **positions of Bing and Ding (丙丁)**.

**Yin (阴)** is the **Dao’s foundation (本)**,
the **medicine’s base (基)**;
**Yang (阳)** is the **origin of form (始)**.
Before **mercury (汞)** transforms,
**Yang (阳)** cannot stand alone,
**Yin (阴)** cannot generate by itself.
Thus, **Yang (阳)** depends on **Yin (阴)** for its existence,
**Yin (阴)** receives **Yang (阳)** to conceive.
When the two are harmonized,
the **Great Dao (大道)** is fulfilled.

Fire generates Earth;
Earth nurtures the myriad things.
Thus, the **medicine’s use of Earth (土)** is to
enable **mercury (汞)** to grow and flourish,
as the **foundation of all things (基)**.

Earth’s count is **Five (五)**,
belonging to the **Spleen (脾)**,
encompassing the **Four Symbols (四象)** and **Four Viscera (四藏)**.
Thus, the **Five Palaces (五宫)** and **Five Emperors (五帝)**
wander through the **Nine Heavens (九天)**,
observing the Dao to generate **One**.

Therefore, **Earth (土)**,
dwelling in the **Nine-Five (九五)** position,
is the most **venerable (尊)**.

The **human’s spirit (神)** is **thirty-six thousand (三万有六千)**,
its **form and shadow (形影)** are **twenty-two thousand (万有二千)**,
its **essence-light (精光)** is **one thousand two hundred (千有二百)**,
its **soul (魂)** is **three (三)**,
its **ethereal soul (魄)** is **seven (七)**,
its **spirit (神)** is **five (五)**—
all relying on the **Five Viscera (五藏)**,
with the **Spleen (脾)** as their master.
Thus, among medicines,
the **virtue/power of Earth (土之德)** is most **venerable (尊)**.
For it can **transform the Five Phases (化五行)**,
and thus forge the **Ultimate Medicine (至药)**.

**Great Substance (太素)** is the **root (本)**—
when the root is established, the Dao is born.
The **Three Elixirs (三丹)** all draw from this!
Their **upper correspondence** is the **Three Heavenly Palaces (三天之宫)**—
this is called **Upper Clarity’s Fire (上清之火)**,
**Jade Clarity’s Gold (玉清之金)**,
**Great Clarity’s Earth (太清之土)**.

Their **west** holds **seven ethereal souls (七魄)**,
their **east** holds **three souls (三魂)**.
**Ethereal soul (魄)** is the **Yin’s essence (阴之精)**,
governing the **autumnal *qi* (秋之气)**—
the **austerity and killing (肃杀)**.
**Soul (魂)** is the **Yang’s essence (阳之精)**,
governing the **springtime *qi* (春之气)**—
the **emergence and birth (发生)**.
Thus, the **Dragon and Tiger (龙虎)** face each other,
**souls and ethereal souls (魂魄)** depend on each other.

The **Classic** says:
*Shock (震)** is the **essence of Wood (木之精)**,
the **cinnabar (丹砂)**.*

The **essence of Wood (木之精)** obtains **gold (金)**,
and thus merges to become the **Sovereign of Great Elixir (大丹之君)**.

Fire is the **father (父)**,
*qi* is the **minister (使)**!
The **determined scholar (志士)**—
only by discerning the **Five Phases’ mutual generation and succession (五行之相生更王)**,
can one achieve the **Great Elixir (大丹)**.

The **Classic** says:
**Three, Five, One (三、五、一)** are the **ultimate essences of Heaven and Earth (天地之至精)**.
Dwelling in the **Four Seasons (四时)** while able to **generate and complete (生成)**—
**Spring (春)** does this.
**Three**—how does it generate the myriad things?
This is the **transformative *qi* of Heaven and Earth (天地之化气)**,
which forms **humans, animals, and beasts (人物、禽兽)**.
My **myriad things (万物)** are **gold and silver (金银)**.
**Three** supplements *qi*,
strengthens **tendons and muscles (筋力)**,
and benefits the **spirit (精神)**.

**Kan (坎)** is **Yin (阴)**—
holding **One (一)**.
The **Yang stem’s (阳爻)** form appears **five (五)** times.
**Three** is the **Wood’s spirit (木之灵)**.
The **Great Elixir’s Dao (大丹之道)**—
this is its **mysterious gateway (玄关)**!

The **Supreme Pole (太极)** of things—
none fail to return.
Earth dwells in **Primordial Chaos (混沌)**,
like a **tortoise (鹦子)**,
divided into **Two Principles (二仪)**.
**Two Principles (二仪)** are **Heaven and Earth (天地)**,
**Qian and Kun (乾坤)**,
**Yin and Yang (阴阳)**.
Heaven is **clear (清)**,
Earth is **turbulent (浊)**—
the myriad things are nurtured within.
It is like the **medicine’s core (药之中)**,
where **mercury (汞)** transforms into myriad things.

Thus, the **Ultimate Person (至人)** first establishes the **cauldron (鼎)** to symbolize **Heaven and Earth (天地)**.
Then, the **Sun, Moon, stars, and constellations (日月星辰)**,
the **Four Symbols (四象)** and **Five Phases (五行)**,
are all established through the **cauldron (鼎)**.
When refining,
one must not lose the **stars’ points (星点)**,
embracing the **colors and symbols of the Five Phases (五行之色象)**,
and only then is it **perfected (至)**.

「Thus, when **Yin** and **Yang** do not interact,
the **Heaven** and **Earth** become sealed and stagnant.
If **Heaven descends** and **Earth ascends**,
mountains and marshes exchange their **Qi**,
their interaction is indispensable.

Hence, **Heaven and Earth** have **opening and closing (开阖)**,
the **Sun and Moon** have **mutual illumination (交映)**,
and the **Ultimate Person (至人)** follows this principle in action.
In **thirty-six decades (三十有六旬)**, one awakens and refines,
purifying and augmenting, merging and harmonizing.
This is the **Nine Transformations (九转)**!

When fully attuned to the **Four Symbols (四象)**,
one attains **spiritual transcendence (通於灵)**.
The **Four Symbols** are:
the **Azure Dragon (青龙)**,
the **White Tiger (白虎)**,
the **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)**,
and the **Dark Tortoise (玄武)**.

In the *I Ching* (**易**), they are the **Four Symbols (四象)**;
in the human body, they are the **four limbs (四支)**;
in **Heaven (天)**, they are the **four seasons (四时)**;
on **Earth (地)**, they are the **four cardinal directions (四极)**;
in **medicine (药)**, they are the **four divine essences (四神)**.

The **Azure Dragon (青龙)** is **Yang (阳)**,
the essence of **Wood (木)**, governing **generative vitality (生成)**.
The **White Tiger (白虎)** is **Yin (阴)**,
the essence of **Metal (金)**, overseeing **destruction (杀)**.
The **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)** is **Yang (阳)**, the **Sun (日)**,
with the **Fire (火)** essence,
dominating the **south**—where there is **Earth (土)**—
and in the **Jia (己)** stem, it nurtures **growth and expansion (生长)**.
The **Dark Tortoise (玕武)** is **Yin (阴)**, the **Moon (月)**,
with the **Water (水)** essence,
dominating the **north**—where there is **Earth (土)**—
and in the **Wu (戊)** stem, it subdues the **Three Excesses (三彭)**,
serving as the **foundation of the medicine (药之基)**.
When they **interact and merge (交合)**,
they enter the **central chamber (中官)**,
never straying from the **Wu-Jia (戊己)** harmony.

The **Nine Transformations (九转)** are when
the **four divine essences (四神)** and **Five Phases (五行)** reside within,
and the **two opposing forces (二象)**—**Yin** and **Yang**—
are positioned without and within as **auxiliary (佐)** and **supportive (助)**.

My **sinews, bones, blood, flesh, and spirit-Qi (神气)**,
how could they not be fully nourished by this?
If any one aspect is deficient,
then it becomes **weakness (啧)** or **illness (疾)**.

My **medicine’s completion (药成)**,
must rely on **Yang obtaining Yin (阳得阴)**.
Thus, one must **contain and protect (含护)** it,
until it reaches **three hundred and sixty (三百有六十)**,
then the **embryonic essence (凝胎)** can be solidified,
returning to **spiritual roots (还神)**** and **immortal form (固形)**.
The **jade marrow and golden sinews (玉髓金筋)**** will then be recorded among the **True Ones (真人)**.

To pursue **external shortcuts (旁通之方)** without mastering the **ultimate truth (至理)**,
even if one subdues **mercury (汞)**,
and it lies dormant in **Fire (火)** while perishing,
one will never realize that this is sufficient to **cut short one’s lifespan (夭折其生)**!

It is like **drawing a mirror on the ground (画地为镜)** to pray for its reflection of the **gallbladder (胆)**,
or **forging lead into a blade (冶铅为刀)** to pray for it to slay a **whale (鲸)**—
these are futile endeavors.

The **ultimate medicine (至药)**,
must follow the **laws of Heaven (诸天)**,
the **laws of Earth (诸地)**,
and the **laws of humanity (诸人)**,
and only then can it be achieved.

The **Qi of Azure (青)** is **Heaven (天)**.
Within it are the **Sun, Moon, and Five Luminaries (五曜)****,
as well as the **constellations (经星)**.
If one does not lose the **points of the Sun, Moon, and stars (日月星辰之点)**,
then their **light will be fully transmitted (光通达)**.
Without these **Symbols (象)**,
one merely lies dormant in **Fire (火)**—
this is not the **ultimate medicine (至药)**.

In my **medicine’s calculations (药之数)**,
they align with the **interactions of the Sun, Moon, and Five Luminaries (日月五曜之交)**.
If even a **minute fraction (铢累)** is lost,
or if the **proportions of master and minister (君臣)** are misjudged,
then it will surely **harm my life (害吾生)**.

The **Qi of Yellow (黄)** is **Earth (地)**.
If it is **dense and tranquil (厚则安静)**,
then it fulfills the **Earth’s function (土之用)**!
It must be **akin to mercury (汞之类)**—
the **Five Mountains (五岳)** and **Four Seas (四渍)**** remain stable and unshaken,
with **mountains and rivers (山川)****,
and **various minerals (品汇)**.
Each benefits its **corresponding region (方所)**—
thus, the **Five Mountains (五岳)** become the **furnace (炉)**,
and **mercury (汞)** transforms into myriad things.
**Heaven covers (天覆)** them,
**Earth bears (地载)** them,
and **humankind rests (人民安)** in them.

**Heaven and Earth (天地)** are the **cauldron (鼎)**;
**humankind (人民)** is the **mercury (汞)**.

Since the **human form (形)** is originally composed of the **Five Phases (五行)**,
its **restoration (补)** must rely on the **refined essence-Qi (精气)** of the Five Phases.
In ancient times, **Nüwa (女娲氏)** refined **five-colored stones (五色石)** to patch **Heaven’s breaches (天之阙)**—
this is a fine analogy!

**Bones (骨)** are **Metal (金)**;
**blood (血)** is **Water (水)**;
**flesh (肉)** is **Earth (土)**;
**Qi (气)** is **Wood (木)**;
**warmth (暖)** is **Fire (火)**.
This is not the **Five Phases (五行)** as commonly spoken of!

Only when **four**—**Metal, Water, Earth, and Wood**—
**govern and regulate (管摄)** the **beginning (始)**,
can it be called the **ultimate medicine (至药)**.

I seek **mercury’s kindred (汞之同类)**,
each refined to its **essence (精)** for this purpose.
One cannot **mingle unrelated substances (杂)**—
as the saying goes: *"Foxes and rabbits cannot nurse a thoroughbred (狐兔不乳骥)**,
and *swallows and sparrows do not lay phoenix eggs (燕雀不卵凤)**.*
This is what it means!

The **Five Phases (五行)**,
**retain the spirit (留神)** to restore the **form (补其形)**—
this is the **Dragon-Tiger (龙虎)** method.
If one does not understand the **Five Phases (五行)**,
then one relies on **others’ bodies (他人)** as **parents (父母)**.

Thus, **Qi (气)** is **Wood (木)**;
**bones (骨)** are the **White Tiger (虎)**;
**blood (血)** is the **symbol of Water (水之象)**;
**flesh (肉)** is the **symbol of Earth (土之象)**.
The **path to immortality (不死之道)** lies in the **separation chamber (离宫)**—
once the **Five Phases (五行)** are known,
the **body has its master (身有主)**.

The **Five Phases (五行)** are **closest allies (亲於)** to **mercury (汞)**.
When the **Five Phases (五行)** are properly **aligned (相配)**,
they **generate and complete (生成)** my **medicine (吾药)**.
**Metal (金)** generates **Water (水)**,
**Water (水)** generates **Wood (木)**,
**Wood (木)** generates **Fire (火)**,
**Fire (火)** generates **Earth (土)**,
and **Earth (土)** generates **Metal (金)**.

Thus, **Spring (春)** is **Wood (木)**;
**Summer (夏)** is **Fire (火)**;
**Autumn (秋)** is **Metal (金)**;
**Winter (冬)** is **Water (水)**;
and the **intermediate seasons (四时之季)** are **Earth (土)**.
**Wood (木)** embodies **benevolence (仁)**,
and governs **generative vitality (生成)**,
so the **elixir (丹)** is the **refined essence of Wood (木之精)**.
**Wood (木)** can generate **Fire (火)**,
so the **elixir (丹)** is the **child of Wood (木之子)**.

In the **eleventh month (十有一月)**,
a **single Yang line (一阳爻)**** emerges.
In the **twelfth month (十有二月)**, reaching the **first month (正月)**,
they all belong to **Spring (春)**.

**Fire (火)** governs **propriety (礼)**,
and fosters **vigorous growth (滋茂)**—
my **medicine (吾药)** is also thus in this season.
Hence, **Fire (火)** is the **substance that solidifies myriad things (坚万物)** while remaining **imperishable (不朽)**.

The **Sage (圣人)** thus refines **Yin medicine (阴药)** to complete **Yang medicine (阳药)**,
so that the **Yin body (阴身)** returns to the **Yang position (阳位)**.
When the **form is solidified (形固)** and the **spirit is complete (神备)**,
one attains **guesting in Heaven (宾於天)**—
this is the **function of Fire (火之功)**.

Thus, the **Golden Elixir (金丹)**** arises in **Spring (春)** and flourishes in **Summer (夏)**.
Compare it to **grasses and trees (草木)**,
which **rely on the four seasons (禀四时)** to grow—
how much more so for my **elixir (丹)**!

When **Fire (火)** reaches **two (二者)**,
it can **generate in Earth (土)**.
In the **second (二月)**, **third (三月)**, and **fourth (四月)** months,
they all belong to **Summer (夏)**.

The **intermediate seasons (四时之季)** have **Earth (土)**,
which governs **trustworthiness (信)**—
there is no **abandonment (弃)** in **generation and completion (生成)**.
One must **cherish and select (沃执)** the **central position (中位)**,
even if one does not **grasp the four cardinal directions (执四维)**.

Yet, in the **Four Symbols (四象)**,
**Earth (土)** serves as the **foundation for growth (资)**.
All **myriad things (万物)**,
**originate from Earth (因土而生)**.
My **elixir’s Earth (吾药之土)**,
emerges from the **Flowering Pool (华池)**,
and **generates through Fire (因火而生)**.
Its **refinement (寄治)** lies in **Bing (丙)** and **Ding (丁)**,
revealing what **Earth (土)** generates.

Wood is **completed into Earth by Fire**,
and Earth can **generate Metal**—
thus, **Earth possesses the Five Virtues**.

The **interwoven cycles of beginning and end**,
serve as the **foundation for medicinal use**.

**Earth reigns over the four seasons**.
Autumn embodies **principle (义)**—
why does my elixir **generate and complete** in the **seventh month**?

After the **Establishment of Autumn (立秋)**,
grasses **begin to flourish**.
By this time, my elixir’s **Nine Returns and Seven Reversions** are **already complete**,
and its **qi** surpasses **Mid-Autumn Metal**.

The **two phases of the moon**—
the **Hare and Toad (蟾兔)**—
when **full and bright (三五圆明)**,
my elixir’s **Metal essence solidifies**.

The **Mao (卯) and You (酉) days**—
the **gates of the Eight Trigrams**—
the **Yin and Yang days (寅申)**—
the **roots of Yin and Yang**—
these are the **timely moments of life and death**,
which **cannot be transgressed**.

How so?
Metal’s **generation from Water** is **complete**—
it **retires and yields its position**,
and in the **fifth and sixth months**,
its **position belongs to Water and Autumn Metal**.

When **one Yin line is born**, it becomes Metal—
thus, by the **seventh month**,
there is **no further generation**.

Why?
Because it is the **Autumn order**—
in humans, the **kidneys govern wisdom**.
Wisdom is **concealment (藏)**,
**overseeing the five phases and four symbols**,
**potently transforming in secret**.

The **Sage follows this**,
marking the **beginning of the Great Transformation’s foundation**.

The **Three Affairs** arise from this root!
In terms of **time**, it **rules over ice’s strength and snow’s abundance**,
when **all things retreat and hide**.
The **Sage follows this**,
using **Fire throughout the year**—
the **four seasons are complete**.

Thus, in the **tenth month**, the **embryo sheds its shell**,
from **Yin (寅) to Hai (亥)**,
and the **elixir’s work is complete**.

The **unaware** assume the **tenth-month shedding**,
yet **do not know the four seasons are incomplete**.

The **elixir’s completion** requires **cycling through the four seasons**—
from its **beginning to the tenth month**,
a full **year has already passed**,
and within the **embryo’s refinement**, there are **two purifications and washings**.

Only when the **four seasons are complete** does the **shedding occur**—
then the **four seasons cycle fully**,
the **five phases are whole**,
and the **luminous stars are arranged**.

This is the **beginning of the supreme elixir’s completion**.

The **eighth, ninth, and tenth months** belong to **Winter**—
when the **five phases reach their peak and pass the torch**,
the **transformation’s success returns to purple**.

This is the **principle of effortless, natural harmony**.

Thus it is said:
**The two Yin-Yang** are the **ancestors of the Three Sovereigns**.
Which comes first—**Water or Earth**?
It is the **root source of the Kǔ and Zǐ trees**!

The **Flowering Pool** is the **Tiger’s embryo**;
the **Mao Gate (卯门)** is the **Dragon’s claw**—
the **four symbols and five phases generate endlessly**.

If one **cannot subdue the elixir**,
it **will not submit**.

Metal **overcomes Wood**—
Wood **returns to Metal**.
Wood **overcomes Earth**—
Earth **returns to Wood**.
Earth **overcomes Water**—
Water **returns to Earth**.

The **intermingling of the five phases** has **ten such cases**—
let us speak of **two**:

**Jia (甲)** is the **wife of Geng (庚)**;
**Bing (丙)** is the **wife of Ren (壬)**—
the **wealth of the aged, overpowering matron**.

If one **does not grasp the five phases**,
**exaggerating their harmony**,
**ignoring the master-servant relationships**,
**neglecting the minutest details**,
and **hopes for the elixir’s completion**—
it is like **climbing heaven with a ladder** or **fishing the sea with a needle**!

Thus, if one **does not know how to subdue and refine**,
the **spiritual qi will not converge**.

The Yellow Emperor said: *"The essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the Spirit Water and Hua Pool—what does this mean? It is the regulation of one yin by one yang.*

The Heavenly Old Man replied: *White is the essence of Metal—is this not the yang one? Black is the foundation of Water—is this not the yin one? Water is the Dao, the principle of the three-one.*

The three-one—are they the three *dantian*?

If I can guard them, I shall ride the Dragon Pill and wander in the Upper Clarity.

The three are all obtained from the one.

If one knows this, then half of my elixir is already complete.

Thus, Metal is born from Water, and Water grows from Metal.
When Metal and Water meet in measure, the elixir is perfected—
one must exhaust Water and Fire.

Water and Fire are the five phases within—
not the external Water and Fire.

This is the Dao, by which the Three Sovereigns set their example,
and Confucius expounded the *Ten Wings* to aid it.

*Virtue* is attainment—
cultivate it in the body, and virtue becomes true.

What is *true*?
Is it the Golden Elixir nourishing the form?

Cultivation of the external is not what I call *true*.

Laozi said: *The highest virtue does not virtue itself,
and does not seek virtue as virtue—
it is the lower seeking it.*

Thus, the highest virtue is Water;
the lowest virtue is Metal.

My Golden Elixir has the principle of pottery and casting,
the timing of the sun and moon—
when the sun is full and the moon is full, they alternately pass the torch.
The *Classic* says: *Virtue governs vital qi*—this is so.

The numbers of yin and yang are complete.

The five phases move in cycles—
clear and turbid unfold and contract,
as yang prevails and gradually intermingles,
while yin lies dormant and returns to the treasure.

This is called *true virtue*—how could the elixir fail to form?

The five phases complete themselves in Earth.
If a person ingests it, their qi transforms into treasure—
thus, they attain longevity, becoming a *True Person*.

Thus it is said: *Earth has five virtues*—
not the virtues of the world, such as *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual), *zhi* (wisdom), and *xin* (faith).

The Sun is the essence of accumulated yang—
its number is nine.
In Heaven, it forms the *xiang* (constellation);
on Earth, it forms the *xing* (shape).
It harmonizes all things,
spreading qi to give life to all beings.

Within it is the *bàwū* (striding crow),
the essence of yin.
Its *xiang* is protective and encompassing,
as *hun* and *po* intertwine—
thus, it belongs to the *lǐ* branch and the Fire palace,
also attaining the number nine.

Its gathered qi is the *jūyīng* (crimson seed)—
when refined, it solidifies its form,
thus aligning with the *èryùyī* (two-five-one) mystery.

Thus, the Sun governs the blood vessels—
it is the father of the elixir.

The ancient *Perfect Ones* refined the Sun’s essence,
and their bodies returned to pure yang,
wandering in the Supreme Clarity.

The Moon is the essence of yin—
accumulated, it forms the *kǎn* (abyss),
dwelling in the Water direction,
its number one.

My elixir’s Metal—
is it not like the Moon?

Yang interacts with yin,
congealing into substance.

Thus, the *kǎn* *xiang* is inner yang and outer yin.

The Sun and Moon move at varying speeds,
and the elixir’s nature has dryness and slowness.
Yang is dry;
yin is slow.

But the elixir is otherwise:
Yang is slow;
yin is dry.

Dryness—like the Moon’s movement;
slowness—like the Sun’s movement.

The Sun’s movement—
one degree per day and night,
completing a full cycle in a year.

The Moon’s movement—
twelve degrees per day and night,
completing a full cycle in a day.

Thus, the Sun and Moon—
twelve degrees unite in a year.

The Sage, therefore, takes the symbol of thirty days—
the sequential conjunction of the Sun and Moon—
and opens the cauldron,
purifying my elixir.

The Sun has the crow;
the Moon has the toad and rabbit—
why?

The crow is the essence of yin qi;
the toad and rabbit are the essence of yang qi.

The two qi merge and protect,
returning to nature—
the two qi are inner symbols,
the two qi are outer symbols.

The Sun and Moon’s dual functions are the elixir’s *xiégài* (auxiliary agents).
What is *xiégài*?

The Golden Cauldron—
*kǎn* and *lí* paired to form it?

Thus, *kǎn* is yin, the Moon;
*lí* is yang, the Sun—
Water, Earth, and Metal are the three unified substances.

When the two qi merge within the cauldron,
their light shines and leaps—
is it not like the Sun and Moon linked in an endless chain across the six directions?

Nourish and refine it for a thousand days,
and yin will be exhausted—immortality attained.

Let me establish symbols to verify this.

The *Xuánwǔ* (Mysterious Tortoise) is yin;
the serpent is yang;
the tortoise is yin—
the principle of male and female,
the Dao of the Golden Tortoise.

The pairing of tortoise and serpent—
this is the natural yin and yang of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, the supreme elixir requires the pairing of yin and yang,
extracting the finest essences,
uniting spirit and truth,
with master and minister in proper measure—
then, in accordance with the Sun and Moon’s conjunction,
following the four seasons’ circulation,
only then is it supreme.

What is *exchange and union*?
The male *kǎn*, the female *lí*—
paired with the Sun and Moon, secretly merging,
exhausting one *yuánqì* (primordial breath) as the elixir sprouts.

*Yuánqì* is sixty days.

Thus, from the *yín* hour to the *shēn* hour—
seven returns.

From *zǐ* to *shēn*—
nine returns—
the principle of seven returns is complete.

Thus, the supreme elixir—
at the conjunction of new and full moons,
pursues the principle of the child’s growth and the parent’s longevity,
and completes its cycle here—
this is the use of Fire.

Heaven completes one cycle in a day and night,
moving through 365 degrees.
The Sun, Moon, and stars revolve around Heaven—
thus, Heaven descends and Earth ascends,
the Sun unites once,
and all things are thereby generated and transformed.

Five days—
the symbol of one *yuánqì*,
sixty times.

Thus, one month has six *yuán*,
totaling 360 times—
the first fifteen days are yang,
symbolizing spring and summer;
the latter fifteen days are yin,
symbolizing autumn and winter.
Thus, one month contains the four seasons’ principles of generation and completion.

I can embody the Dao of the annual fire’s timing,
using trigrams and nodes to open the cauldron’s vessel.

A day and night—
its twelve hours:
six are yang,
six are yin—
two *yuán* in ten days.

The daily use of Fire has its measures,
advancing and retreating,
with the principles of waxing and waning—
child and parent ascending and descending in their cycles.

*Xiāo* is to employ its time;
*xi* is to withhold its use.

The Sun and Moon meet once in thirty days.
Fifteen days round—
the half-year’s symbol of two seasons;
until the new moon, when yin prevails—
the year’s symbol is complete.
Thus, the medicine lies fully concealed.

The new moon is birth,
so I model my medicine upon it,
adding or subtracting, cleansing and refining—
this is the timing of years, months, days, and hours.

The *Classic* says:
*"Thirty spokes converge at a single hub."*
This is the method of daily Fire use.

The Sage thus entrusted the *Yì*’s symbols,
establishing trigrams and nodes.
*Lún* and *Méng*—
their clarity comes from dawn and dusk,
so dawn is governed by *Lún*,
dusk by *Méng*—
thus, no error in the waxing and waning.

*Jìjí* and *Wèijì*—
the beginning and end of the month,
the agents of their affairs.

Who knows that within yin there is yang?
Like lead containing white gold—
thus, the yellow sprout emerges from the River Cart.
What is this Dao?
Lead and mercury forge it.

Then, the yin valley contains the yang flower—
this is the essence of inner correspondence.
Compare it to parents transmitting *qi* to form the body;
what sustains the void is the essence-*qi* of the body.
Those who use gold, silver, lead flowers, and cinnabar as the yellow sprout—
is it not like using flesh as a womb?

Who knows that within yang there is also yin?
Yang containing yin, like the Sun’s eclipse—
this is the hidden resonance of yin and yang.
Thus, mercury is born from cinnabar—
yang within yin!
Mercury is yin in nature yet contains yang essence;
*Lí* is externally yang but internally yin.
White gold produced by the River Cart—
yin containing yang.
Its clouds follow the Dragon,
its winds follow the Tiger!
Yin and yang are the Dao of Nature.

My supreme medicine—
its prohibitions, its regulations—
each has its method.
Can this be conveyed by mere documents?
Its essence lies in the Master and Guest mutually nurturing,
harvesting the Four Seasons,
refining the Five Phases—
only then does the supreme medicine emerge.
Thus, it can restore marrow and extend longevity—
how could it not rely on the essence of the Four Spirits,
the purity of the Five Phases?

Those who forge medicine from lone yin and scant yang
can only cure illness—
how could they reverse aging and return to the True?
Why?
Their vital essence is incomplete.
Some see cinnabar concealed beside Fire,
manifesting in mercury,
and say, *"Only mercury can forge the medicine!"*
This is as if a man could generate himself,
or a woman conceive without seed—
never seen since humanity’s birth.

I shall speak of the Nine Transformations’ method,
and have illustrated it.
Within is the Central Yellow Palace,
the domain of *wù-jǐ*—
its exterior is black,
then white,
then red,
then green.
The Green Dragon occupies the east,
the White Tiger the west,
the Vermilion Bird the south,
the Dark Tortoise the north—
and there are Sun, Moon, and stars,
the Five Phases generating and overcoming.
The white gold seed is planted,
making the spiritually adept perceive clearly.
The *Classic* says:
*"Cast it, and it becomes a pearl."*
This is the creation of the Immortals.
As a staff, it subdues like punishment;
as a mirror, it banishes malevolent spirits.

The *Tàiyì*—
the Sun, Moon, and stars are insufficient for its height,
the Four Quarters and Eight Extremes are insufficient for its distance—
near in the body, far in Heaven and Earth.
Heaven, Earth, and Man—
if one attains it, all become great.
Great—
great in form, great in character—
one person is great!
One—
the True One—
those who attain it become True Persons.
They can transform without limit,
command spirits and summon souls—
the power of the Divine Elixir.

To contain Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—
there are green, yellow, red, white, and black.
The Four Symbols divide and govern,
the Five Spirits lack none in power,
the Seven Luminaries display their brilliance—
arrayed in order, ruled by measure—
the foundation of the Primordial,
the suitability of the Manifested—
one can nourish the body and shed the flesh,
and forever dwell at the world’s edge.

*Yì*—
easy, yet encompassing all symbols.
Thus, the Sage exhausted the Sun and Moon,
penetrating the profound and the obscure.
Yet Heaven’s *Yì* has sixteen,
Earth’s *Yì* has sixteen,
Man’s *Yì* has sixteen,
Ghosts’ *Yì* has sixteen—
totaling sixty-four.

If Heaven displays its symbols above,
the Five Stars wander in their mansions,
revealing calamity and fortune;
dawn and dusk divide the light,
overseeing the exchange of yin and yang.

Displayed on Earth,
it transforms *qi* into myriad forms,
planting and nurturing in season;
nesting, dwelling in caves—
each finds its place.

Displayed for Ghosts,
it shapes the formless,
erasing guilt and granting rebirth.

Displayed for Man,
body and spirit soar together,
clinging to the Dragon, riding the clouds—
saluting the Nine Heavens, roaming the Three Palaces,
living as long as the Three Lights.

Thus, the Sage entrusted the *Yì*’s symbols
to refine *yuánqì*,
solidifying form and preserving spirit,
receiving the Four Symbols to attain spiritual clarity,
harvesting the Five Phases to subdue them—
cycling through the Twenty-Four Seasons,
until the supreme medicine is complete.

At ten months,
the embryo unites with Heaven and Earth’s creation.
This Dao can make one return to the Origin and revert to the Primordial.

Man is endowed with *yuánqì* to form the body,
yet is burdened by accumulated yin.
To reverse yin and return to yang,
a thousand days are needed to temper the cold form,
transforming skin, hair, bone, and flesh—
when they become gold and jade, one ascends to Heaven
and attains the rank of True Person.

This is the resolve of the determined scholar—
to refine elixir and body alike, and thus pursue it!

Those who merely aspire to the Great Elixir and ascend to Heaven
are already deluded.

The ancients who ascended did so in plain robes,
ingesting the Lower Elixir first,
thus encountering the Upper Elixir
and attaining Heaven—
for such was their innate destiny.

In days of old, the Yellow Emperor cast nine tripods
in the wilds of Jing Mountain,
to symbolize the Nine Regions.
The First Region was Ji,
the Second, Jing,
the Third, Qing,
the Fourth, Xu,
the Fifth, Yu,
the Sixth, Yong,
the Seventh, Liang,
the Eighth, Yan,
the Ninth, Yang.

Each governed the auspicious and inauspicious of its domain—
yet these were not the uses of the supreme elixir.

Only the elixirs of those who transcended the world
trace their lineage to the Three Sovereigns.
What are the Three Sovereigns?
The Celestial Sovereign, the Terrestrial Sovereign,
and the Human Sovereign.

The Three Sovereigns left behind writings
speaking of the Three Gates.
The Three Gates held three tripods—
the Lü and the Two—making nine in total.

Thus there are:
the Upper Elixir of the Highest Immortal,
the Upper Elixir of the Middle Immortal,
and the Upper Elixir of the Lowest Immortal.
These are the Nine-Cycle Returning Elixirs.

Next are the methods of the Golden Fluid,
also rooted in the logic of the Returning Elixir.
To abandon these for lesser practices
is but to cure disease—
nothing more.

Thus the Great Elixir of the Three Sovereigns
is the foundation of transcendence.

Within the elixir are three elixirs,
corresponding to the Three Heavens, the Three Fives, the Three Lights,
and the Three Talents.

Within the three elixirs are nine revered forms,
corresponding to the Nine Regions, the Nine Palaces, the Nine Qi,
the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Earths.
Each corresponds to celestial hosts with divine guardians—
named the Nine Grades,
thus called the Nine Tripods.

Within one tripod lies the Great Tripod of Luoyang,
its white as silk,
its platform three-tiered,
its furnace eight-sided.
The Flame Emperor enters the *Lí* Gate,
while yin clouds swirl within the *Kǎn*,
thus forming unity.
The world, Heaven and Earth,
the sun, moon, and stars,
the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
the Four Spirits and Five Phases,
rulers and subjects, figures and forms,
lands, mountains, and rivers,
golden platforms and jade towers,
treasure flowers and rare fruits,
jade nectar and sweet springs—
their fragrance permeates the air.
Those who consume it transcend to the Highest Immortals,
wandering in the Hall of Numinous Mushrooms.

The Venerable Master said:
*"I am not one born of Nature’s spontaneity,
but one who learned and attained this."*

The three elixir furnaces differ in scale and fire-count—
their diagrams appear in separate volumes.

To cultivate the supreme elixir, one must first set up the furnace.
The furnace is the tripod, the ramparts and moats.
A tripod without a furnace
is like a man without a dwelling,
a city without its outer walls—
how could it stand secure?

Thus the furnace is the tripod’s gate,
a shelter from winds and gaps,
so the Three Qi do not disperse.
The platform has three tiers,
the furnace eight sides and eight gates,
the Twelve Celestial Stems intersecting,
aligned with the Dipper’s position.
Its form resembles the Tortoise Mountain,
adjusting in size as needed.

The *Classic* says:
*"Before Heaven and Earth arose, it was born,
with ramparts on either side—
a likeness of Penglai."*

Thus one must know the celestial patterns above,
the earthly geography below,
human affairs within,
master the *Xuàn* diagrams,
harmonize yin and yang,
discern the Four Seasons’ auspicious and inauspicious,
grasp the sun’s and moon’s ascensions and descents,
adjust the fire’s timing,
and observe the rites of life and death.
This is the foremost concern in cultivating the supreme elixir.
To act rashly is to fail without exception.

Moreover, Heaven and Earth’s establishment
has boundaries between yin and yang,
fixed positions for the Child and the Horse,
spring’s birth and autumn’s death—
the natural order of Heaven and Earth.

The sun and moon intersect,
yin and yang have their stations,
the supreme elixir has its symbols,
the fire’s timing has its diagrams—
used as in a cyclical method.

The first month corresponds to *Jiǔ Èr*,
when the elixir’s body harmonizes and begins to form.
Its hexagram is *Tài* ,
its tone *Tàizhù*.
*Tài* means *Kǎn* below and *Lián* above.
*Tài* marks the beginning of convergence,
yang and yin balanced,
the Tiger’s spring birth,
sprouts swelling with vitality.
The Four Symbols unite as one,
mysterious and indistinct.
The virtuous occupy their place,
their power vast and boundless.
This is the breath of yang.

The second month corresponds to *Jiǔ Sì*,
when mercury transmutes into gold.
Its hexagram is *Dà Zhuàng* ,
its tone *Jiá Zhōng*.
*Dà Zhuàng* means *Kǎn* below and *Zhèn* above.
The yang lines grow stronger,
*Kǎn* transforms into spirit,
emeralds and pomegranates blend as one root,
pure qi mingles—
victory and defeat unclear,
some sink, some float,
forming the *Mǎo* Gate’s symbol.
This is the breath of yang.

The third month corresponds to *Jiǔ Wǔ*,
when impurities are washed away,
its radiance advancing with clarity.
Its hexagram is *Guì* ,
its tone *Gū Xǐ*.
*Guì* means *Kǎn* below and *Duì* above—
five yang and one yin.
Its body is where yin and yang intermingle,
just and gentle in measure.
Yin retreats in concealment,
the age of the Flying Dragon.
This is the breath of yang.

The fourth month corresponds to *Shàng Jiǔ*,
the time of the Fire Monarch,
when its essence is sealed.
Its hexagram is *Qián* ,
its tone *Zhòng Lǘ*.
The Dragon lies potent yet hidden,
the serpent coiled—
its patterns and laws marked,
yin and yang take root,
yang at its peak then sinks,
guard against excess.
This is the breath of yang.

The fifth month corresponds to *Chū Liù*,
when the supreme elixir’s yang is active
yet positioned in yin.
Its hexagram is *Pí* ,
its tone *Gēng Bīn*.
*Pí* means *Kǎn* above and *Xùn* below.
Its beginnings form,
frost and snow its purity,
the embryo thick and fertile.
Yin rules as yang’s master,
the pivot of the Dao,
concealment as its gate.
The arrival of frost,
ice hard and cold.
This is the breath of yin.

The sixth month corresponds to *Liù Èr*,
when softness transmutes into strength,
its path now flourishing—
though the world fixes on mercury alone.

The seventh month corresponds to *Liù Sān*,
when mercury’s nature is pure yang,
and the elixir reaches its peak—
life and formation now complete,
its breath already still.
Its hexagram is *Dùn*,
its tone *Lín Zhōng*.
*Dùn* means *Kùn* below and *Qián* above.
*Dùn* hides and withdraws,
nurturing and dwelling in repose,
not revealing itself to gain renown,
awaiting the time to unfold.
Once the congealed essence is exhausted,
it ascends in straight lines upon its carriage.
This is the breath of yin.

The eighth month corresponds to *Liù Wǔ*,
when the metal *qi* reigns supreme,
and the elixir’s substance is refined—
the toad and hare thus perfect the luminous round.
Its hexagram is *Guān*,
its tone *Nán Lǘ*.
*Guān* means *Kùn* below and *Xùn* above.
The Dipper establishes *Nán Lǘ*,
observing scales and balances,
to cultivate the primordial *qi*,
replacing decline with flourishing.
The *Mǎo* and *Yǒu* gates stand,
the willow falls while the mallow rises,
harvesting the sprouts,
so calamity no longer prevails.
This is the breath of yin.

The ninth month corresponds to *Jiǔ Èr*,
when the divine *qi* transforms into concealment—
the foundation of fire.
Its hexagram is *Bō*,
its tone *Wú Shè*.
*Bō* means *Kùn* below and *Gèn* above.
*Bō* destroys the body,
plunging into silence,
returning to its aged state,
its essence congealed yet unascended.
When *Pǐ* reaches its extreme, *Tài* follows;
consumption and dissolution grow faint,
the primal auspiciousness flourishes—
the yellow garment beneath.
This is the breath of yin.

The tenth month corresponds to *Shàng Liù*,
when the supreme elixir is fully formed.
Its hexagram is *Kùn*,
its tone *Yìng Zhōng*.
*Kùn* softens the *qi* into unity,
ashen earth its shape,
profound principles like hidden springs,
the *Xīng* of yang, the *Jīng* of yin.
The law is structured, ready to be measured,
the cycle of giving and receiving completes formation.
First, the furnace’s ashes obscure,
then the thread is feared and stirred—
the Dragon battles, drinking blood,
yet its name brings no merit.
This is the breath of yin.

The eleventh month corresponds to *Chū Liù*,
when yang *qi* lies dormant at its edge.
Its hexagram is *Fù*,
its tone *Huáng Zhōng*.
*Fù* means *Kùn* above and *Zhèn* below.
Yang *qi* hides,
nurturing yin’s virtue,
its form blurred yet bound by cosmic law,
a model for all—
first obscured, then revealed.
This is the breath of yin.

The twelfth month corresponds to *Jiǔ Èr*,
when sprouts and seedlings begin to thrive,
the Dipper establishes *Zǐ Chǒu*,
marking the start of the meditative posture.
Its hexagram is *Lín*,
its tone *Dà Lǘ*.
*Lín* means *Duì* below and *Kùn* above.
It circles the furnace, its boundaries complete,
the Dragon seen in the fields,
its radiance divided yet brilliant.
Now it begins its migration,
pushing and yielding in turn,
never acting first,
the morning mist tasted,
the past no longer guiding the present.
This is the breath of yang.

The Heavenly Elder says:
*"What has been listed before
is like beads strung on a thread,
clear and orderly—
unveiling the intricate mysteries of the Daoist Immortals!*
I shall now clarify their applications.

*Fù* reveals the loss of companions,
and the initial rising of fire.
Why?
*Kùn* consists of six yin lines.
The first line changes to yang,
so one yang line beneath five yin—
this is the attainment of companions.
A line that changes to yang—
this is the loss of companions.
*Fù* is *Kùn* above and *Zhèn* below,
the initial stage of the yellow sprout,
the symbol of nurturing the unmanifest,
the guardian of transformation.
*Zhèn* reveals its change.
*Qián* consists of six yang lines,
and *Zhèn* is *Qián*’s eldest son.
Why?
*Kùn* changes from below,
thus becoming *Zhèn*;
*Zhèn* changes from above,
thus becoming *Gèn*—
hence, it is the eldest son,
inheriting the body of *Qián*.
Thus, *Kùn* is *Qián*’s position,
and *Qián* is *Kùn*’s position,
each serving as host to the other.

In the eleventh month,
one line of *Kùn* changes to yang,
and by the fourth month,
all six lines are complete,
returning to *Qián*’s position and function.
*Xùn* reveals its completion.
The sun is yang,
the moon is yin.
From the first day to the fifteenth,
the moon changes and becomes *Qián*.
Thus, *Zhèn*’s function is passed on.
When the moon reaches its fullness at the sixteenth,
it changes one line of *Qián* to *Xùn*—
one yin line is born.
The long line is yang,
the short line is yin—
mercury’s nature is rigid yet hard to subdue.
Thus, it transforms hardness into softness,
completing the elixir’s essence in gentleness.
Hence, *Xùn* receives *Qián*’s transformation,
and on the sixteenth day,
the moon emerges from the *Xùn* earth,
the elixir forming from the new moon’s dawn—
now fire too seeks concealment.

*Zhūn* is *Kǎn* above and *Zhèn* below,
illustrating my purpose—
the fire of day, the fire of moon.
Thus, morning’s function aligns with *Zhūn*’s directness,
evening’s with *Méng*’s directness,
and the waning and waxing phases with *Jìjí* and *Wèijì*.
When the moon reaches its waning and waxing phases,
the vessel is opened to receive yang’s single line.
The moon’s fifteenth day is yang,
and the yang descends to its proper position by the sixteenth.
Its yang is diminished,
so the sun’s light wanes,
changing *Qián* to *Xùn*—
this is the transformation from rigid to soft.
*Duì* reveals its equilibrium.
The sun and moon unite once every thirty days,
and after three days of union,
their light begins to appear.
Thus, the eighth day is called the *upper* crescent,
and the twenty-third day the *lower* crescent.
Crescent means equilibrium.
From the first to the eighth day,
the moon’s waxing reaches half its equilibrium;
from the fifteenth to the twenty-third day,
the moon’s waning depletes half its equilibrium.

My use of fire spans from the first to the eighth day—when metal and water merge—
and by the twenty-third day, the medicine is perfected, motionless.
This is its equilibrium.
**Guàn** reveals its form.

Metal is born at *sì*, reigns at *yǒu*, and is buried at *chǒu*.
Autumn is the season when metal reigns.
On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, its form is round and bright,
and my medicine reaches this stage—
the *Qián* body is now complete,
its five colors radiant,
growing ever firm and solid.
*Chǒu* is the burial of metal,
the position of **Guàn**.
The medicine reaches **Guàn**, its form now clear.

Metal reveals itself only through metal.
By the twenty-third day, it appears in the *bǐng* region,
the lower crescent, motionless—
my medicine lies dormant.

**Qián** reveals its rigidity.
On the first day of the moon, the yang line’s *xiào* intermingle and generate,
reaching fullness by the fifteenth day.
My medicine, when heated for fifteen days,
has metal and water unite, each attaining its place.

Mercury is yang and of rigid nature—
difficult to subdue.
By method, it is made motionless.

The east is the domain of wood.
Metal flourishes with wood;
by the fifteenth day, the moon is in the *shù* region,
the *jiǎ* earth—
its fullness now complete in *jiǎ*.

**Kūn** reveals its transformation.
The single line of **Kūn** shifts to become **Zhen**.
**Zhen** is wood, is yang;
**Kūn** is yin.
Yet it nurtures one yang with five soils.
Yang is wood—mercury is its likeness,
like lead with silver within.
Thus it is said: **Kūn** is the mother of **Zhen**!

**Qián** and **Kūn** combine twelve lines,
the symbol of a year,
establishing the foundation of omens.
What does this mean?
From **Kūn**, yang is born,
from *zǐ* to *sì*—
the six lines’ transformations are complete.
**Qián** arises from *wǔ* to *hài*,
six lines shifting back to **Kūn**.
**Kūn** is soil—
my medicine, after twelve months, becomes soil,
its work now finished.

The *Classic* says: Metal is born from the moon.
At the new moon, it receives the sun’s seal,
so the first day is called *Fù*—
yang *qi* begins to flow.
From the last day to the new moon,
**Zhen** arrives to receive its seal,
following **Kūn** to generate the **Zhen** dragon.
Then, after the moon’s birth,
**Kūn** transforms into **Zhen**—
end and beginning in cycle!

The first month is **Tài**—
the full symbol of the sun’s crow is complete.
Its three lines are yang.
This month holds:
**Lún** (*Zhen* below, *Kàn* above),
**Méng** (*Kàn* below, **Guàn** above),
**Xū** (*Qián* below, *Kàn* above),
**Sòng** (*Kàn* below, **Kūn** above),
**Shī** (*Kàn* below, *Lí* above),
**Bǐ** (below *Kàn*, above).
They align with their proper order.

Thus, on the first day,
morning uses **Lún**, evening **Méng**;
on the second day,
morning uses **Xū**, evening **Sòng**;
on the third day,
morning uses **Shī**, evening **Bǐ**.
From the first to the third day—
its **Zhen** is in motion.

The second month is **Dà Zhuàng**.
The moon clings to the sun but is unseen.
On the fourth day,
morning uses **Xiǎo Chù** (*Qián* below, *Xùn* above),
evening **Lǚ** (**Duì** below, *Qián* above);
on the fifth day,
morning uses **Tài** (*Qián* below, **Kūn** above),
evening **Pǐ** (**Kūn** below, *Qián* above);
on the sixth day,
morning uses **Tóng Rén** (*Lí* below, *Qián* above),
evening **Dà Yǒu** (*Qián* below, *Lí* above).

The third month is **Guì**—
the moon’s right side begins to grow.
On the third day, it appears in the *gēng* region, split asunder.
Thus, for every use of fire in one watch,
there are six lunar watches—
so twelve months yield seventy-two,
its work complete at a thousand.

This month, on the seventh day,
morning uses **Qiān** (**Guàn** below, **Kūn** above),
evening **Yù** (**Kūn** below, **Zhen** above);
on the eighth day,
morning uses **Suí** (**Zhen** below, **Duì** above),
evening **Guì** (*Xùn* below, **Guàn** above);
on the ninth day,
morning uses **Lín** (**Duì** below, **Kūn** above),
evening **Guān** (**Kūn** below, *Xùn* above).

The fourth month is **Qián**.
On the eighth day, the upper crescent appears in the *dīng* region,
its equilibrium straight as a cord.
The moon has two *qi*—
twelve months yield twenty-four *qi*.
On the fifteenth day, the two crescents merge their vital essence,
thus **Qián** and **Kūn** unite to form the *èr bā*,
in accord with the *Yì*’s way—
upright and unerring.

On the tenth day,
morning uses **Shì Hé** (**Zhen** below, *Lí* above),
evening **Bì** (*Lí* below, **Guàn** above);
on the eleventh day,
morning uses **Bó** (**Kūn** below, **Guàn** above),
evening **Fù** (**Kūn** above, **Zhen** below);
on the twelfth day,
morning uses **Wú Wàng** (**Zhen** below, *Qián* above),
evening **Dà Chù** (*Qián* below, **Guàn** above).

The fifth month is **Jù**—
the full symbol of the sun’s crow is complete.
By the fifteenth day, the *Qián* body is complete,
round and luminous in the *shù* region.
On the thirteenth day,
morning uses **Yí** (**Zhen** below, **Guàn** above),
evening **Dà Guò** (*Xùn* below, **Duì** above);
on the fourteenth day,
morning uses **Xián** (**Guàn** below, **Duì** above),
evening **Cháng** (*Xùn* below, **Zhen** above);
on the fifteenth day,
morning uses **Dùn** (**Guàn** below, *Qián* above),
evening **Dà Zhuàng** (*Qián* below, **Zhen** above).

The sixth month is **Dùn**;
the seventh month is **Pǐ**—
the full symbol of the hare is complete.
Metal and water together receive the *Tài Yáng*’s *qi*,
nurtured to form the elixir of return.

The *Classic* says: **Qián** is vigorous, bright, and flourishing.
The sun has twelve hours—
thirty days yield three hundred sixty,
so each month has one day of fire use.
In all, one small cycle is twelve months.

The sixteenth day,
morning uses **Jìn** (**Kūn** below, **Lí** above),
evening **Míng Yí** (**Lí** below, **Kūn** above);

the seventeenth day,
morning uses **Jiā Rén** (**Lí** below, **Xùn** above),
evening **Kuí** (**Duì** below, **Lí** above);

the eighteenth day,
morning uses **Jiǎn** (**Gèn** below, **Kǎn** above),
evening **Jiě** (**Kǎn** below, **Zhèn** above).

The eighth month is **Guān**—
the Five Phases shift in sovereignty,
mutually restraining to govern.
The *Classic* says: On the sixteenth,
its *turn* receives the *tong* (统).
**Xùn**’s *tong* appears at dawn,
**Xùn** cuts off its *tong*, so the sixteenth *turn* receives the *tong*.

The moon waxes then wanes,
so the sixteenth *turn* mutually calls (喊) to one another.
The gap in one *qi* cycle ends on the fifteenth day,
and its color transforms—
the sun shines and illuminates at the *rì quē* (日阙),
thus mercury transforms into liquid!

The nineteenth day,
morning uses **Sǔn** (**Duì** below, **Gèn** above),
evening **Yì** (**Zhèn** below, **Xùn** above);

the twentieth day,
morning uses **Guài** (**Qián** below, **Duì** above),
evening **Gǔ** (**Xùn** below, **Qián** above);

the twenty-third day,
morning uses **Cuì** (**Kūn** below, **Duì** above),
evening **Shēng** (**Xùn** below, **Kūn** above).

The ninth month is **Bō**—
the moon wanes on its right,
while its left remains like a hook.
On the first day, it appears in the **Bǐng** region.
**Gèn** stands straight in the **Bǐng**’s south.
The *lower half* of the month is the twenty-third day.
**Bǐng**’s *principle* converges with its essence,
the **Qián** and **Kūn** forms are complete.

The twenty-fourth day,
morning uses **Kùn** (**Kǎn** below, **Duì** above),
evening **Jǐng** (**Xùn** below, **Kǎn** above);

the twenty-fifth day,
morning uses **Gé** (**Lí** below, **Duì** above),
evening **Dǐng** (**Xùn** below, **Lí** above);

the twenty-sixth day,
morning uses **Zhèn**,
evening uses **Gèn**.

The tenth month is **Kūn**—
the full symbol of the moon is complete.
It is twice diminished to form **Gèn**,
and the twenty-third day of the lower half.
Its water is half a *jīn* (斤).
In all, the alchemical uses of fire, medicine,
and returning to earth’s function are combined,
so its form resembles earthly ash.

The twenty-seventh day,
morning uses **Cán** (**Gèn** below, **Xùn** above),
evening **Guī Mèi** (**Duì** below, **Zhèn** above);

the twenty-eighth day,
morning uses **Fēng** (**Lí** below, **Zhèn** above),
evening **Lǚ** (**Gèn** below, **Lí** above);

the twenty-ninth day,
morning uses **Xùn**,
evening uses **Duì**.

The eleventh month is **Fù**—
the month of renewal, where the sun and moon together complete their cycle of thirty days.
Hence, the sun and moon unite on the **Kūn** root,
while the **yīn-yáng** *qi* converges and is stored within.

When sun and moon unite, the **jīnshā** (金砂, gold-sand) aligns according to its share.
This is the **Kūn**’s thirtieth day—
the day of the **jìxū** (节虚, hollow nodes), the day when the sun and moon’s phases are obscured by eclipses or conjunctions.

The twenty-eighth day,
morning uses **Huàn** (**Kǎn** below, **Xùn** above),
evening uses **Jié** (**Kǎn** above, **Duì** below);

the twenty-ninth day,
morning uses **Zhōngfú** (**Xùn** above, **Duì** below),
evening uses **Xiǎoguò** (**Zhèn** above, **Gèn** below);

the thirtieth day,
morning uses **Jìjiè** (**Kǎn** above, **Lí** below),
evening uses **Wèijiè** (**Lí** above, **Kǎn** below).
Thus, I derive the **Kūn** cycle.

**Kūn** is the **yīn** position,
one transformation yielding **Zhèn**.
**Zhèn** inherits the **Qián** essence,
being the eldest son.

**Zhèn** transforms once into **Duì**,
**Duì** once into **Fù**,
completing the **Qián**’s three phases.
Thus, I derive the **Qián** cycle.

**Qián** is the **yáng** position,
one transformation yielding **Xùn**.
**Xùn** then receives its governance,
returning to the **Kūn** position.

**Xùn** transforms once into **Gèn**,
**Gèn** once again into **Kūn**.
**Kūn** is when the alchemical **virtue/power** is fully realized.
**Kǎn** and **Lí** are the two essential phases.

The **Yuányáng Zǐ** (元阳子, Primordial Yang Master) says:
*"Lónghǔ* (龍虎, Dragon and Tiger) are **qiān yóu** (鉛汞, lead and mercury);
**jīntǔ** (金虎, Golden Tiger) is **qiān** (鉛, lead),
the foundation of **huán dān** (還丹, elixir).
**Qiān**’s hue is black, belonging to the northern realm,
the waters of **rén guǐ** (壬癸, the ninth and tenth heavenly stems),
the singular count of water.

He who knows its singularity
comprehends all affairs.
Thus, **qiān** contains the five colors,
embodies the quintessence of the five phases—
this is the fate of the immortals.

The **Lǎozǐ** (老子) says:
*"Bào yī shǒu zhōng, zǐ shēn zì zhòng* (抱一守中，子身自仲).
He who clings to the singular and upholds the center
shall naturally find his body sustained."

Great is the Dao of the singular!
I observe the **three yellows and one black** (三黄一黑) that confer immortality—
what does this mean?

This is the name of the **soul-nurturing elixir** (灵丹).
In the human body, it manifests as three,
yet one refines the three—
thus ascending to **feīxiān** (飞仙, transcendence).

The three are:
**mù** (木, wood, i.e., sulfur),
**qiān** (鉛, lead),
and **dānshā** (丹砂, cinnabar).
The one is **shuǐ** (水, water),
for **dānshā** is the essence of the southern realm’s **Tàiyáng** (太阳, Great Sun),
its essence being **gǒng** (汞, mercury).
**Gǒng** is the **Qīnglóng** (青龙, Azure Dragon),
the wood’s singular count.

Wood generates fire,
fire is red and belongs to the southern realm—
thus binding the **Fùmǔ** (父母, parent-child) positions.
Wood’s essence, when joined with metal,
becomes **qiān**—
**qiān**, being metal, the Azure Dragon dwelling within the wood’s essence,
is the **Zhōngnán** (中男, Central Male).

**Qiān**’s metal essence resides in **yǒu** (酉, the tenth earthly branch),
dwelling in the western realm as **Báihǔ** (白虎, White Tiger)—
the **Zhōngnǚ** (中女, Central Female).

The **Èrshísì Shèng Gē** (二十四圣歌, Twenty-Four Sacred Hymns) states:
*"Central Male and Central Female,
reside at the gates of **Zǐwǔ** (子午, the fourth and tenth branches),
only when the sun and moon are distinctly divided,
does the longest reign begin.*

*Central Male subdues the Central Female,
both yielding to ash,
uniting with water and earth.
This is the grand principle of the five phases.*

**Dānshā** (丹砂, cinnabar) emerges from **gǒng** (汞, mercury),
**gǒng** being the essence of **yáng** (阳, yang),
prone to ascendance yet difficult to contain—
this is the **Lǎonǚ** (姥女, Old Lady)!

Thus it is said:
*"The Old Lady of the Riverbank,
is subtle and most divine—
when fire is obtained, she ascends,
unseen by filth and dust.
Dragon hides, Tiger conceals,
none know their abode.
To subdue her,
take the yellow sprout as root.*

*The yellow sprout is **qiān** (鉛, lead) and **shuǐ** (水, water);
**gǒng** (汞, mercury) is fire—
can water subdue fire?

Wood’s nature is upright, subduing metal,
water’s nature is yielding, subduing earth,
earth’s nature is thick, subduing wood,
metal’s nature is firm, subduing fire.
This is the profound root and grand Dao
of **qiān yóu** (鉛汞, lead and mercury),
progressing gradually toward **tónglíng** (通灵, attunement with the numinous).

I possess the principle of **nà táizī** (纳胎, embryo-nurturing) and **yuánqì yánshēng** (元气延生, prolonging life through primordial *qi*).
Let me expound it:

The **Tiāndì Tàichū Yuánhé** (天地太初元和, primordial harmony of heaven and earth)
ultimately returns to singularity.
It generates all things,
thus **Qián** and **Kūn** receive the **yuánqì** (元气, primordial *qi*).
Water is the mother of **gǒng** (汞, mercury),
which in turn generates metal.

The **yīn** refines the **Xuányīn** (玄阴, profound *yin*) essence,
first igniting fire to unite with it,
and applying the **guà** (卦, trigrams).

Adding a **yáo** (爻, line) to each **xún** (旬, decan),
until **Jìjiè** (既济, Fulfilled),
then returning to **Gēngshǐ** (更始, Renewal),
thus the sun and moon intermingle,
and the **huán dān** (還丹, elixir) emerges in crimson hue.

From the northern realm, one takes the **Héchē** (河车, River Vehicle).
The **Héchē** is the **shuǐjī** (水基, water foundation)—
this is **gǒng** (汞, mercury).
One must obtain the **Nánfāng Zhǔquè** (南方朱雀, Vermilion Bird of the south),
to merge the **water-fire *qi*** and complete the **huán dān** (還丹, elixir).

The western realm’s metal is refined with **yīn-yáng** (阴阳),
emerging from **Bìshuǐ** (碧水, Jade Water),
its bloom like **yù** (玉, jade).

**Lóngshé** (龙蛇, Dragon and Serpent) are metal and fire,
when first placed in the furnace,
their subjugation is not yet fixed.
One must securely seal the **Dāoguī** (刀圭, Knife and Tablet) vessel,
lest it leak.

Metal, bloom, and **gǒng** (汞, mercury),
when forming the **huán dān** (還丹, elixir),
generate all things,
control life and death,
harmonize with heaven and earth—
they are not of the **bāshí wǔjīn** (八石五金, eight minerals and five metals) kind.

**Chànǚ** (诧女, Astonishing Maiden) is **gǒng** (汞, mercury);
**Xuányīn** (玄阴, profound *yin*) essence is the **shuǐjī** (水基, water foundation).
The two *qi* merge and return to singularity—
the **huán dān** (還丹, elixir) is complete.

The **Héchē** (河车) is not merely **gǒng** (汞, mercury),
but also the convergence of **yīn**’s laws and **yáng**’s conditions.
When the two *qi* merge,
the fire flourishes and the medicine is perfected,
its divine nature like the **Lóng** (龙, Dragon),
unfathomable.

Yet, observing its **huìshuò** (晦朔, waning and new phases),
discerning the fire’s conditions,
and examining its form and substance—
thus, all the **huán dān** (還丹, elixir) methods are exhausted.

**Gě Zhìchuān** (葛稚川) asked **Zhèng Sīyuǎn** (郑思远):
*"What is the human role in the interplay of **yīn-yáng** (阴阳)?"*

*"The **yáng** essence establishes the **hún** (魂, soul),
the **yīn** essence forms the **pò** (魄, spirit).
The two essences intermingle,
giving rise to **shénmíng** (神明, divine clarity).
When the **shén** (神, spirit) departs,
the **xíng** (形, form) perishes.

Dare I ask:
Can the **shén** be preserved?
Can the **xíng** be prolonged?
**Sīyuǎn** replied:
*"The **shén** is perfected through the **Dao**,
the **xíng** is prolonged through **shù** (术, technique)."*

**Zhìchuān** asked:
*"What is the essence of the **Dao**?"*

**Sīyuǎn** replied:
*"Take the **jīn** (金, metal) essence,
blend the **shí** (石, stone) fluid,
bind them as husband and wife,
rank them as **hún** (魂, soul) and **pò** (魄, spirit).
In one undifferentiated mass,
the two essences stir and ignite—
the **hé chē** (河车, River Vehicle) overturns,
the furnace’s vigil knows no pause.
The great kiln blazes fierce,
baking, scorching, roaring—
smoke not yet blackened,
flame without false green.
Like a whirlwind coiled,
or thunder concealed—
the **lǎonǚ** (姥女, Crone) breathes shallow,
the infant’s cry falls silent.
Piercing the **liǎng yí** (两仪, dual principles),
adorned on four walls—
how many times does it pass?
A horse gallops a post,
and lo, it dies.
Yet transformation follows change,
evil discarded, virtue ascendant—
emotion turns, nature shifts.
Purple radiance reaches inward,
red beams shoot outward,
shining like fire’s birth,
then congeals as blood-drops—
called the **zhōnghuán** (中还, Central Return).
Retreating, hidden in secrecy—
mist disperses through five viscera,
rivers flow through a hundred vessels,
bones transmute into golden growth,
complexion returns to jade-like luster.
**Yáng** virtue spreads,
**yīn** function accumulates—
the **Nángōng** (南宫, Southern Palace) records the name,
the **Běidì** (北帝, Northern Sovereign) registers the deed."

**Zhìchuān** asked:
*"Heaven and Earth are vast,
the human body is minute.
Yet one who refines the utmost essence to forge the elixir—
who can fathom its depth?
When **qi** is paired, it harmonizes;
when isolated, it falters.
Harmony brings longevity,
isolation brings early death.
This is the **Dao**—
one **yīn**, one **yáng**.
This is the **dān** (丹, elixir)—
one **jīn**, one **shí**.
The stone, riding **yáng**, grows hot;
the metal, riding **yīn**, grows cold.
Like water flowing to moisture,
or fire moving to dryness."*

**Sīyuǎn** replied:
*"**Yáng** culminates at **wèi** (巳),
**yīn** reaches its peak at **hài** (亥)—
the four seasons cycle endlessly.
Moreover, the **shí** fluid hides in the **guǐ** (鬼, spectral),
the **jīn** essence dwells in the mountains—
these are **gūyīn** (孤阴, lone **yīn**) transformations,
waiting in the **jiǔyōu** (九幽, Nine Abysses).
Better than this is the **jūnzǐ** (君子, noble) embracing the sphere,
pairing with the virtuous maiden—
thus **yīn-yáng** finds balance,
and **hún-pò** (魂魄) knows no bounds.
Yet how does one refine the **shí** fluid?
Harvested before the silkworm feeds,
used after the fire’s transformation—
**yáng** descends from above,
the empty crucible receives it.
Orbiting sun and moon,
waiting through the five **fú** (伏, scorching periods),
urgent as a drum’s beat—
the **jīn** essence will not flee.
Pour with water, and it enters **wú** (无, non-being) from **yǒu** (有, being);
warm with fire, and it enters **yǒu** from **wú**.
White powder lies abandoned—
snow itself is shamed.
Yellow tallow congeals—
gold is made plain.
Endless refinement—
the spirit soars, the **guǐ** (鬼, spectral) hastens—
lifting the **hún** essence,
thus one may match Heaven and Earth in age!"

**Wèi Xiānshēng** (魏先生) said:
*"Three and five combined—
the essence of Heaven and Earth.
Who knows their return to **yī** (一)?
**Yī** is the number of water,
the origin of the Five Phases.
It can generate Heaven and Earth as male and female,
return the sun’s essence to the moon’s cave,
bind the pure within the central **qi**—
the **Zǐlíng** (紫灵, Purple Spirit) portals align with the True.
The *Yì* (易, *I Ching*) speaks of the **Dao** supreme—
thus **qiánkūn** (乾坤, Heaven-Earth) revolve, their virtues gathered;
**kǎn-lí** (坎离, Water-Fire) act, gold and water unite—
this is the **Dao**’s pivot.
Male and female unite,
**qi** mingles, bodies merge—
this is the **Dao**’s application.
Sun and moon revolve,
cold and heat alternate—
this is the **Dao**’s verification.
**Yīn** extends, **yáng** bends,
**yáng** acts, **yīn** lies dormant—
one goes, one returns,
pushing emotion, containing nature—
this is the **Dao**’s three reversals.
Why so?
Splitting **yīqì** (一气, singular **qi**) by Heaven and Earth’s law,
merging **yǒuzuò** (有为, conditioned) with **wúzuò** (无为, unconditioned).
What need for external aid?
**Shénnóng** (神农) said:
*'Knowing white, guarding black—
one may not die.'*
What does this mean?
**White** is the essence of **jīn** (金, metal),
not the world’s **jīn**.
**Black** is the foundation of **shuǐ** (水, water),
not the world’s **gōng** (汞, mercury).
**Qiān** (铅, lead) is black without,
golden flowers within.
The **golden flowers** are the **Qīnglóng** (青龙, Azure Dragon),
its trigrams **qián** (乾, Heaven),
dwelling in the **mù** (木, Wood) position,
its number **sān** (三).
Wearing coarse robes, cradling jade—
the madman outside,
this is the **Báihǔ** (白虎, White Tiger).
Again, it is **dānshā** (丹砂, cinnabar),
**gōng** (汞, mercury),
**kūn** (坤, Earth),
dwelling in the **tǔ** (土, Earth) position,
its number **wǔ** (五).
Thus, three and five in harmony—
the eight **shí** (石, stones)’s framework.
Combining three and five,
their total is **bā** (八).
Thus, **jīn** is the mother of **shuǐ**,
its mother hidden in the child’s womb;
**shuǐ** is the child of **jīn**,
its child concealing the mother’s egg.
Why?
**Jīn-shuǐ** merge in gestation,
rolling within the mother’s depths,
awaiting transformation to birth.
Thus, the eldest son inherits the father’s form,
establishes the mother’s foundation—
cinnabar is born from **jīn**,
so mercury flows as child!
Nourishing the child with **jīn**,
inheriting form and flourishing—
this is Nature’s marvel.
The *Gǎngtōng Jué* (港通诀) says:
*'The **Xuánbái** (玄白, Mysterious White) gives birth to **Jīngōng** (金公, Metal Lord),
towering at the very beginning.'*
The *Jīnbì Piān* (金碧篇) says:
*'Red marrow flows as **gōng** (汞).'*
**Gōng** is not external—
it is born from the union of **qiánkūn** (乾坤, Heaven-Earth),
receiving **qi** and forming.
Heaven’s **qi** descends,
Earth’s **qi** responds,
**yīn-yáng** intermingle—
and **gōng** flows.
Its father is **wù-jǐ** (戊己),
its mother is **huángjīn** (黄金, yellow gold).
Thus observed, **dānshā** (丹砂) is born
from the union of the Three Powers,
harmonizing the Five Phases—
how can it be spoken of with mere words?
The *Jīng* (经) says:
*'Plant millet with millet,
cover parrots with their young.'*
This is **qiān** (铅) and **gōng** (汞)—
they serve only their own kind, do they not?"*

The **emotions** arise from **nature**, and **nature** is inherited through **emotions**; **emotions** and **nature** depend upon each other, returning to the **Dao** of spontaneity—this is the principle of **transformation**.

Yet **Heaven-Earth**, **yin-yang**, **Metal-Water**, **Wood-Earth**, and **nature-emotion**, though their origins are the same, bear different names. If they do not align with their kind, they cannot enter into harmony. Thus it is said, *"Like follows like"*—this is the meaning.

Water subdues Earth, Metal flourishes through Wood; only because they mutually subdue and generate do they become **father and mother** to one another.

**Gōng** (mercury) is not the proper element of any of the Five Phases, nor is **dānshā** (cinnabar) the pairing of **Lóng-Hǔ** (Dragon-Tiger). If they do not belong to their kind, they cannot unite.

Thus it is said:
*"Do not destroy my **lead (qiān)**, lest my life be lost;
Do not abandon my **river chariot (héchē)**, lest I fail to return home."*

Thus it is said:
*"If lead severs the river chariot, all efforts are in vain;
If lead shatters the river chariot, all works come to naught."*

Therefore, within **lead** there is **Metal**, and within **Metal** there is **returning elixir (huándān)**. If one can perceive and recognize this treasure, then the **Dao** is attained.

Yet it is better to refine the **Metal within lead** than to refine the **treasure within Metal**. From this, I know that **Dragon-Tiger** originate from **One**.

The people of the world labor with excessive cleverness, ever farther from the truth. Some say, *"Use lead!"* Others say, *"Use mercury!"*
If one truly uses **mercury**, how can **Heaven-Earth** remain upright? How can **yang-yin** be divided?
If one truly relies on **lead**, how then does **Metal-Water** arise? How does **returning** proceed?

How then can **transformation** arise from its true source?

The ancient sages praised **lead** but did not emphasize **mercury**—why?
Is it because the two together complete the work, and thus must be harmonized in beauty?
Or must **mercury** be the master, borrowing **lead’s qi** to achieve completion—how can one construct the root while neglecting the foundation?

The **Dao** is indeed hidden in what is unsaid!

Later generations, confused by this, seek to till stones for rice—how difficult it is to succeed!

Within **lead** there is **sand-mercury**, just as within a person there are **emotions** and **nature**—they are not external things. **Sand-mercury** in **lead** is not a foreign substance.

The **Three-One Dao** refines **emotions** to harmonize **nature**; when **nature** is harmonized, it returns to the root and recovers simplicity.

The **Golden Elixir** method nourishes **Metal** with **mercury**, then the soul returns and the essence is restored. If external things are **emotions**, then **nature** cannot be harmonized.

Can the **Three Officials** be steadfast?
If **water-silver** is **mercury**, then **lead** cannot be embraced.

Can the **Eight Stones** be perfected?
The **Eight Stones** are another name for the **Three-Five** (trinity of **Heaven-Earth-Man** and the Five Phases).

**Nature** governs the inner realm, establishing **Yín-È** (the alchemical furnace);
**Emotion** governs the outer realm, constructing the **city walls**.

Thus it is known that **mercury-sulfur** is the **emotion** of **lead**; the **Original Qi** is the root foundation of humankind.

**Metal** governs the outer realm, like our **emotions**;
**Mercury** governs the inner realm, like our **nature**.

To govern **mercury** with **Metal** is to uphold the principle of harmonizing **emotion** with **nature**;
To contain **essence** and nourish **spirit** is to practice the **Way** of refining **nature** and attaining **authenticity**.

The **East**—**Jia-Yi Wood**—is the **Azure Dragon**;
The **West**—**Geng-Xin Metal**—is the **White Tiger**.

When the **Dragon** calls to the **Tiger**, the **Tiger** absorbs its **essence**;
The two feed upon each other, both greedy for glory—why?
The **Dragon** is **emotion**, the **Tiger** is **nature**;
Their mutual dependence and return is the profound meaning.

Thus it is said:
The **Great Sun** flows its **pearl**,
Ever desiring to depart from humankind;
Yet when the **golden flower** is attained,
It turns and relies upon each other;
Transformed into **white elixir**, it congeals into **solid perfection**;
The **golden flower** first blooms,
After a brief moment—
It dissolves into water, like **hemp seeds** scattered.

Is this not what the world calls **mercury** and **cinnabar**?

Having already spoken of the principle of **"White Guarding Black"**, thus the **essence of the Great Mysterious** becomes the root of the **Dao**.

Pivoting **Heaven-Earth**, forging **Yin-Yang**,
In accord with **Nature**, accompanying **Transformation**,
Hence the **Two Strings** are set in order,
Combining **Two-Eight** above and below,
Attaining the **body of Heaven-Earth**.

I ponder the **Trigram of the Great Ease**,
Exhaust the functions of **Heaven-Earth**,
Thus the **six lines** contain **three hundred eighty-four**—
The **spirit** resides within them.

**Heaven’s** tally is **two hundred sixteen**,
**Earth’s** tally is **one hundred forty-four**;
Extending and lengthening them,
Classifying and accumulating them,
Totaling **twenty-five thousand two hundred**—
This is how they respond to the myriad things,
Fulfilling the **bodies of firmness and softness**!

**Heaven’s** number is **twenty-five**,
**Earth’s** number is **thirty**,
Thus **Heaven-Earth’s** number is **fifty-five**—
This is how **transformation** and **return** are accomplished.

**Heaven** is the accumulation of **Yang**,
**Earth** is the gathering of **Yin**.
When **Heaven** is **blocked** and **Earth** is **closed**, the **Divine Manifestation** appears.

The **Original Transformation** is applied uniformly,
Its function is boundless,
Also lying in the combination of **Metal-Wood-Water-Fire**.

Its cold and heat, decline and flourishing,
Like the succession of **spring, summer, autumn, winter, day, and night**—
**Metal** generating **Water**, **Water** generating **Wood**, **Wood** generating **Fire**, **Fire** generating **Earth**—this is the use of **Yang**;
**Earth** overcoming **Water**, **Water** overcoming **Fire**, **Fire** overcoming **Metal**, **Metal** overcoming **Wood**—this is the use of **Yin**.

This mutual generation and mutual destruction,
Alternating flourishing and decline,
Conforming to **Heaven-Earth’s** four seasons,
Thus forming the myriad realities.

The **Sun** is the **Yang essence**;
The **Moon** is the **Yin specter**.

**Metal** is born from the **Moon**, thus the **male of Kan**;
The **pearl** is born from the **Sun**, thus the **female of Li**.

**Metal** is the **Moon’s essence**, dwelling in the **Yang** position;
**Mercury** contains the **Li qi**, responding to the **Yin line**.

Thus, using the **Heaven-Earth’s** numinous power,
Conceiving the **Sun-Moon’s essence**,
When **Yin** is exhausted, **Yang** is born;
When **blockage** reaches its extreme, **prosperity** arrives.
Therefore, when **Metal** enters **fierce fire**, its color is not diminished by brightness—
Since the **opening of the gates**, the **Sun-Moon** have not diminished their luminosity.
This is because **Metal-Wood** nurture within,
**Water-Fire** respond without,
**Heaven’s vigor** is unceasing in its function,
The **Sun’s radiance** is not consumed but grows brighter.

The **Sun-Moon** are what enable longevity and duration,
The beginning and end of all things—
The **Dragon-Tiger** in union hold the **key to the Dao**!

Their conformity to **Heaven-Earth’s** standard,
**Yin-Yang’s** numbers,
Enables **Heaven-Earth** to respond in secret,
Like **pearls linked** and **jades joined**,
Turning endlessly without cessation.

The **Ancient Worthies** practiced this,
Thus they could **precede Heaven-Earth**,
Lead all things,
Stand alone and endure eternally,
Their **spirit-form** unaltered.

Pushing this to its utmost correctness,
It can be summed in one word:
**Mercury-sulfur**—without **Heaven-Earth**, they cannot be obtained;
**Dragon-Tiger**—without **Metal**, they cannot be entered.

When the **Great Medicine** is complete,
Then there is the method of **ingestion**.

In the **Jia-Zi decade**, the day aligns with **Jian**,
Until **Gui-Hai**, marking the **seasonal node**.

I then fast for **three days**, preserving **spirit** and steadying **thought** to ingest it—
This is one **sixty-day cycle**.

Within the **Jia-Zi decade**, if the day does not align with **Jian**,
Then **Mǎn, Dìng, Kāi** are also acceptable.

In its ingestion:
At the beginning of the **eleventh month**, thus after **sixty days**, the body becomes light and mobile;
Next **sixty days**, the **four limbs** become agile;
Next **sixty days**, the **complexion** glows;
Next **sixty days**, the **five viscera** are solid, and **malevolent influences** retreat;
Next **sixty days**, the **body** becomes firm and strong;
Next **sixty days**, the **ears and eyes** sharpen—
This is the **first year’s** verification.

Next **sixty days**, the **hands and nails** shine;
Next **sixty days**, the **aura** becomes manifest;
Next **sixty days**, the **essence-qi** grows stronger;
Next **sixty days**, the **hair turns black**;
Next **sixty days**, the **teeth** become firm and strong;
Next **sixty days**, **[missing text]**—
This is the **second year’s** verification.

Next **sixty days**, **[missing text]**;
Next **sixty days**, **[missing text]**;
Next **sixty days**, **virtue and power** become complete;
Next **sixty days**, the **Six Jia spirits** obey;
Next **sixty days**, the **heart opens and the eyes brighten**;
Next **sixty days**, **distant knowledge** of the four quarters—
This is the **third year’s** verification.

Next **sixty days**, **gazing** emits light;
Next **sixty days**, the **five spirits** are not forgotten;
Next **sixty days**, there is **no hunger or thirst**;
Next **sixty days**, the **hundred spirits** come;
Next **sixty days**, the **five viscera** are moistened;
Next **sixty days**, **heat and cold** can be endured;
This is the **fourth year’s** verification.

Next **sixty days**, **floating and sinking** can be mastered;
Next **sixty days**, **depth and shallowness** can be mastered;
Next **sixty days**, **squareness and roundness** can be mastered;
Next **sixty days**, **strength and weakness** can be mastered;
Next **sixty days**, **length and breadth** can be mastered;
Next **sixty days**, **shortness and length** can be mastered—
This is the **fifth year’s** verification.

Next **sixty days**, one can discern **beauty and ugliness**;
Next **sixty days**, one can discern **old and young**;
Next **sixty days**, one can discern **great and small**;
Next **sixty days**, one can discern **light and heavy**;
Next **sixty days**, one can **enter and exit without hindrance**;
Next **sixty days**, one’s **movement knows no bounds**—
This is the **sixth year’s** verification.

If one **prolongs** the practice without ceasing,
one aligns with Heaven and Earth,
transforming through myriad changes,
ascending to the **Supreme Clarity**.

**Dao Shu** (卷) **33**
*Attributed to Youzi Zeng Can*
**Middle Section of *Can Tong Qi***
*Grass-Cloth Sage’s Transmission*
The *Grass-Cloth Sage* (自号草衣子) said:
*"I have observed the **Five Phases’** principles of **generation and conquest**,
measured the **short and long** of sun and moon,
and discerned the causes of **full and waning phases** and **solstices and equinoxes**.
I adjusted the **Southern Dipper** and turned the **Northern Dipper’s** mechanism,
thus understanding the **four seasons**, **eight nodes**, **seventy-two signs**, and **twenty-four qi**.
Refining elixirs within the **Yellow Court**,
I mastered the **transformation of yin and yang**—
twenty-six transformations in all.

The **lead within water**—this is my **primordial essence**.
Supplement its **pure marrow**, and **immortality** is attained."*

**Continuation of *Can Tong Qi* (Middle Section)**

*"To refine the lead, one must rely upon mercury.
Mercury—this is the treasure within the body.
When lead and mercury unite to form the elixir,
then one becomes immortal in the world.

When one essence manifests in three forms,
the body itself flourishes.
When transformations merge into unity,
one understands the union of yin and yang.
Extracting the yang within yin,
when water and fire are harmonized,
tasting the elixir’s essence,
the body thrives anew.

There is no greater cultivation than preserving and nurturing the breath.
Preserving the breath—this is when the three forms coalesce into one.
If one attains a thousand breaths,
then one ascends to the Three Pure Ones.
How so?
Spirit, breath, and qi—
they return to the One.

Essence and fluid—
nine transformations unite them.
This is the elixir’s supreme principle.

Our elixir—
how could it compare to the world’s use of gold and silver in false alchemy?
Gold and silver are external substances;
how could they transform?
Our medicine is but mercury alone.
Taking silver’s essence,
refining gold’s vitality,
and exchanging them—
never straying from the Way’s transformation.

Three, five, and one—
these are the Dao’s truth.
Pairing one yin with one yang,
cycling through seventy-two signs,
completing nine revolutions in twelve celestial stems,
beginning from *jiǎzǐ*—
taking this, one may prolong life.

The left kidney governs the fluids,
called the ‘Morning Emperor’.
If it flows backward, it transforms into fluid;
in the mouth, it becomes the Pool of Flowers’ water.
The Yellow River rises from Kunlun’s peaks,
its vapor ascending as mist,
heaven’s qi descending as dew.
When yin and yang merge,
they form nourishing rain,
thus enriching all things.
This is like the left kidney generating fluids,
swallowed and descending to the five zang and six fu,
transforming into blood,
which nourishes the body and brings radiance.
Thus, without yin and yang’s qi, nothing lives;
without the fluids of the five zang and six fu, illness arises.

The right kidney governs life.
Its essence ascends to the Emperor,
descending into the *Chóngguī*.
At its demise, two bands strike above the womb.
Its blue veins, like threads,
emit essence on the left, urine on the right.
When blood enters the womb, it becomes essence;
essence then transforms into marrow.
When essence is exhausted and marrow spent,
then death comes.
Thus, those who cultivate life
must preserve the breath above,
never waste the essence below,
and harmonize essence, qi, and fluids—
this is how the great elixir is formed.

Why?
For essence becomes treasure;
refined over time, it becomes the Golden Elixir.
This is the nature of life itself.

Thus, spirit, breath, and qi—
one substance in three forms.
When fluids and essence are depleted,
life’s end is near.

The central palace’s true qi—
yellow, the earth—
is governed by the spleen.
This is the *Dan Tian*,
the root and origin of life.
The left and right kidneys’ black and white fluids and essence
merge into the central palace.
This is called the *Crucible*.
Metal and wood—
they restrain each other.
Obtaining the central palace’s qi,
life’s completion is achieved.
How so?
Earth generates metal,
metal generates water,
water generates wood,
wood generates fire,
fire generates earth.
Thus, fluids and essence
align in the central palace,
ascending to the Upper Elixir,
and from this root, life’s origin arises.
This is the foundation of the great medicine.

Daily, with the four seasons,
close the breath and refine it.
If essence is not wasted,
the great medicine is complete.
Breath is fire;
fluids are water.
This is the path of harmonization."*

Lead is born in the left kidney,
its exterior black, its interior white—
the white governs silver.

How does it transform into wood’s qi?
Wood’s true qi is yang,
dominating the north, belonging to the *zi* position.
Silver perishes when its time comes.
Nurtured by yang qi, it turns yellow.
Then, with the four seasons,
following the *wu-ji* cycles,
the Three Bodies revolve in the central palace—
lead transforms into its *dao-jui* form,
its flavor exquisite.

When the *Kan* gate unites with it,
golden essence governs true water.

Mercury is born in the right kidney,
its essence white, governing metal.

How does it refine metal’s essence?
From the *Li* palace, metal’s qi arises,
dominating the south, belonging to the *wu* position—
this is the metal within yang.
Metal is a yin count.
When it ascends to the central palace,
lead’s blossom appears.
Receiving qi from the crucible,
it becomes its outer and inner layers.
Seeking *wu-ji* to forge the elixir,
one substance takes three forms,
returning to its true body.
Thus, true water is born in the *Li* palace,
lead and mercury unite—
their flavor grows ever more refined.

So the Dragon transforms from lead,
the Tiger from mercury.
Why?
The Dragon is wood,
born from lead.
Its hue is green, and it governs qi.
I have observed this deeply—
the Dragon is truly the grandson of metal,
the son of water.
When metal thrice returns to subdue,
its treasure is complete.
It gathers as curdled milk,
it scatters as—
Why?

The Dragon is born of water,
this is the *mao* palace.
The White Tiger of the West—
this is what it fears.
After the *zi* hour, it seals its qi,
preserving its breath for a thousand breaths,
then the Dragon hides in the fields and does not rise.

Thus, the daily soul is born in *zhen*,
and those who wish to refine their bodies and nurture their lives
should recognize what is called the Dragon.

The Tiger is metal and water,
born of mercury.
Its hue is white, and it governs essence.
I have observed this deeply—
the Tiger is truly the grandson of fire,
the son of earth.
Fire thrice returns to punish metal,
then its treasure is complete.
It gathers as flowing pearls,
it scatters as sweet dew.
Why?

The Tiger is born of metal,
its nature fierce and strong.
Before the *wu* hour, it thrice overcomes and battles the Dragon.
Descending into the central palace,
its body flourishes.
Thus, the daily shadow is born in *dui*,
and those who wish to refine their bodies and nurture their lives
should recognize what is called the Tiger.

Thus, lead and mercury combine to form the elixir.
Lead is the sun’s essence,
the true qi of wood;
mercury is the moon’s bloom,
the true qi of metal.
Wood is *jia*, metal is *geng*, metal is *xīn*.
When true yin and true yang’s vital essence mutually devour,
day and night through twelve periods,
they circulate their bodies,
each forming flowing pearls,
gathering in the elixir field.

When gathered, yin and yang coalesce;
when scattered, the pearls spread to the sea’s edge.
This is when lead and mercury unite,
but the Dragon and Tiger have not yet hidden within each other.
What does this hiding mean?
The sun uses the four seasons,
yin and yang battle in exchange,
gathering at the five victories’ domain.
Above, this becomes the Dragon’s wooden essence;
below, this becomes the Tiger’s metallic essence.
The Dragon descends to the lower realm,
the Tiger ascends to the upper.
At the central palace,
the Dragon and Tiger hide within each other,
returning to one.

What is this Way?
*Wu* and *ji* reside within,
water and fire circulate,
thus achieving the *ji-ji* completion.
Then the gold within the crucible is formed.
The Dragon thus transforms into an infant,
the Tiger into a maiden.
The infant is yang, true qi.
Its name is the Golden Ancestor,
the Jade Nectar,
the crystalline elixir of the Flower Pool.
Thus, wood’s circulation
in the central palace
is the root of the great elixir,
the true body of emptiness,
the fundamental mechanism of profound obscurity and hazy indistinctness.
Its ability to pair with the maiden
requires the Yellow Mother to unite them.

The maiden is yin, true essence.
Its name is the Jade Maiden,
the Golden Elixir,
the White Water.
Thus, metal’s circulation
is in the Hall of Illumination.
Within the Hall of Illumination is a chamber,
where the maiden resides.
If I obtain this,
then the great elixir is complete.
This is the substance within emptiness,
the thing within qi,
obtained from profound obscurity and hazy indistinctness.
What was its beginning?
From blood to essence—
the transformation of the Five Phases.
Seal its spirit-breath,
then the elixir naturally halts.

The Yellow Mother is the central palace,
the elixir field.
Its name is the crucible,
the furnace,
the stone chamber.
The Four Symbols and Five Phases
all rely on *wu-ji*’s true earth.
Why?
All things are born of earth,
so earth is the chamber of the Four Symbols,
the master of the Five Phases.
Without its earth, the Four Symbols lack a sovereign,
the Five Phases lose their master.

I have said the Yellow Mother is the root of the great elixir.
The earth of the central palace,
why is it called the altar?
The altar is the furnace—
the altar has three layers below,
must obtain the five directions,
to take true earth.
Thus, one layer below,
its height is one *chi* and two *cùn*,
corresponding to the twelve months of a year.
One day’s twelve periods.
Below, the Eight Trigrams—
within one *chi*,
corresponding to the Ten Heavenly Stems.
The upper layer of the Eight Trigrams,
its height is eight *cùn*,
corresponding to the twenty-four seasons.
The upper plane is round, sixteen *chi* across,
corresponding to the sixteen *liang* measures.
Four blades are planted on its sides,
corresponding to the four seasons.
Eight mirrors are suspended on all sides.

Thus, I use the four seasons daily,
selecting lead and mercury from the nine-to-one ratio,
discerning the fire’s timing within the body,
taking yang’s transformation to forge the furnace.
The furnace is yang, the divine chamber,
the pivot of the golden elixir.
When the inner spirit takes form,
it is used to refine the elixir.
Secure the furnace’s door,
discern the fire’s timing,
gradually adding the weight.
Do not let dampness linger,
do not rush the lower fire.
One refining, one dose—
if you refine again,
then the already-refined furnace cannot be used.
Its spirit is injured.

The crucible is formed by transforming earth,
not the crucibles of the world.
Yin and yang create in true earth,
cold metal to forge it.
Its mouth must not be too large,
its belly not too vast,
its ears not too sharp or small,
its feet not too wide or narrow,
its nose not too thin or high.
Below, its mouth must be measured correctly,
with no leakage of qi,
then it can be used.
This crucible exists only within my body—
the true qi of the central palace can form it.

Yet the crucible’s flaws are tenfold:
One, iron from spring, summer, autumn, winter;
Two, its mold is uneven;
Three, the fetus is suspended while casting;
Four, its belly is too large;
Five, its feet are too short and curved;
Six, its thickness is uneven;
Seven, its mouth and ears are too narrow;
Eight, its sand holes leak qi;
Nine, its iron is black and not white;
Ten, it is cast out of season.
If cast with the two *bā* (eight and eight),
then the elixir can be formed.

The first transformation of the elixir is called *White Snow*.
*White Snow* is when lead and mercury unite,
when metal and wood mutually restrain each other,
and merge as one—
then the qi arises within the crucible.

When it congeals,
it is like the dew of mid-autumn,
the frost of deep winter—
named *Divine Symbol*,
for it moves through the *zi-wu* [子午] cycle.

The second transformation of the elixir is called *Two Qi*.
*Two Qi* is when lead and mercury bind,
when metal and wood contend,
and the great medicine is refined—
then yellow qi emerges.

Like spring ice in its hue,
its color is green and white,
its radiance red and crimson—
yet it is not yet fully formed,
but already it can dispel illness.

If water and fire do not err in the *two nines* [二九],
then it advances to the ninefold transformations.

The third transformation of the elixir is called *Yellow Sprout*.
*Yellow Sprout* is when lead and mercury unite,
transmitted through the five viscera,
entering the central palace,
gathering the five phases.

*Wu* and *ji* [戊己] are earth.
When metal and wood’s qi find earth,
it is like a ruler with ministers,
a child with a father,
a guest with a host—
then it can be wielded.

Close the breath, preserve the intent,
shut the celestial pass,
return the earthly gate to the lower *dantian*—
thus the root of the great medicine takes form.

Receiving earth’s qi,
its color turns yellow.
This is when the divine breath and qi merge as one,
when the dragon and tiger descend into the crucible.

The fourth transformation of the elixir is called *Four Spirits*.
*Four Spirits* are:
the White Tiger—metal,
the Green Dragon—wood,
the Dark Tortoise—water,
the Vermilion Bird—fire.

Using *yin* [寅] and *shen* [申],
to move the four symbols,
entering the central palace,
paying homage at the Red City,
at the appointed *mao-you* [卯酉] times,
the function operates and turns—
then the infant and maiden unite.

This is the *four nines* [四九] transformation.
Silent and visualizing,
the divine light appears.

The fifth transformation of the elixir is called *White Horse Sprout*.
*White Horse Sprout* is when the five phases are complete.
The true qi of the five viscera, refined by essence and fluid,
merges—
thus the qi and breath unite with *wu* and *ji* [戊己],
moving daily at *yi-hai* [巳亥],
ascending to pay homage at the *niwan* [泥丸].
At *mao-you* [卯酉],
it is conveyed and returns to the lower *yuan* [元],
entering the crucible,
nourished by the *wen-wu* [文武] fires.

At the hour of *chou* [丑],
visualizing reveals white qi emerging.
Thus the medicine of the *dantian* grows,
like a horse’s tooth, emitting white light.

This is the *nine-five* [九五] number—
now all tastes are severed,
and the three corpses [三尸] retreat.

The sixth transformation of the elixir is called *Jade Fluid*.
*Jade Fluid* is when the three yins and three yangs contend,
and the dragon and tiger submit.
The infant is the husband,
the maiden the wife—
then lead and mercury merge.

After *zi* [子] and before *wu* [午],
moving and closing the breath,
the true qi of the six palaces arises spontaneously.
When the six spirits are complete,
they are paired and ascend the twelve layers,
paying homage at the Red City,
entering the Orchid Hall and Purple Bower,
then reentering the crucible—
the jade fluid forms, and tortoise and serpent appear.

The seventh transformation of the elixir is called *Numinous Sand*.
*Numinous Sand* is sevenfold return,
corresponding externally to the *Beidou* [北斗].
At the five night watches,
within the seven orifices,
the true qi of the five viscera moves.
By day, it circulates beneath the skin;
by dusk, it flows above the bones.
When qi moves, the blood flows in harmony;
when blood flows, the qi moves in turn.
If it returns to its source,
it transforms into gold essence.

If the qi reverses,
the blood halts—and then illness arises.
Thus, preserving essence to nourish the marrow
is the great medicine.
Its color is red,
dispersing as flowing pearls,
congealing as a mass.
Within the crucible,
if movement loses its timing,
it flees along its radiance.

I often perform the function at *yin-shen* [寅申] times,
closing the breath,
preserving the spirit—
this is sufficient.

The eighth transformation of the elixir is called *Divine Sand*.
*Divine Sand* is when the four seasons are used daily,
moving the eight trigrams,
with no error in the fire’s timing—
subdued and steadied, it aids the crossing.

Thus, closing the breath,
preserving the spirit,
eating the *yuanhe* [元和] qi when hungry,
drinking the *Huachi* [华池] nectar when thirsty,
all grains are removed, all tastes severed,
the gold essence does not leak—
then the celestial pass does not close,
and the earthly gate locks itself.

The ninth transformation of the elixir is called *Gold Sand*.
*Gold Sand* is when the yin lines—one hundred ninety-two—
form eight *liang* [两] of gold;
the yang lines—one hundred ninety-two—
form eight *liang* of silver.

Dispersed, they become thirty-six thousand *yuan* [元];
congealed, they become the gold elixir—
square and round, five *cun* [寸] in measure,
weighing sixteen *liang* [两],
totaling three hundred eighty-four *zhu* [铢].

This is the *ri-jing-yue-hua* [日精月华] dual qi,
the product of transformation.
A single dose extends life to a thousand years—
the lotus emerges from the fire.

What is meant by *three things as one form*?
Gold, wood, and earth—
gathered, they return to the central palace—
this is the true qi.
Human life and fate depend upon it.

Thus, green, yellow, and white—
born on the left and right of the kidneys,
gathered in the *dantian* as one form,
dispersed as three substances.

Hence the three souls—yang—
obtained, the body flourishes.

Qi transforms into blood,
blood into essence,
like a treasure vase.
Gold, wood, and earth
transform into fluid,
and fire returns to gold—
refined, it becomes true gold.

How do the three things become one?
Water, earth, and metal—
gathered, they become spirit;
dispersed, they become blood, essence, or crucible.
This is my central palace.

Heart, kidneys, and spleen—
are they not red, yellow, and black?

Thus it is said:
The *three-one* number—
the sage’s way of preserving three while guarding one.
Hence, dispersed, they are three;
congealed, they are one—
transforming autumn stone in the *dantian*.

「Once the elixir has undergone nine transformations,
it is refined externally,
turning black and shifting into nine hues—
entering the *central palace*,
it becomes *zizhun* (紫金),¹
and naturally, the body grows robust,
the frame becomes light—
thus attaining the status of an *earthly immortal*.²

What is this Dao?
The *four symbols*³ and *five phases*,
all regarded as *soil*—
this is the origin of the elixir.

The nine transformations align with the *cosmic creation*,
and after a hundred days, the work is complete.⁴

Thus, one must necessarily cultivate *mindful visualization*.
When the hundred days’ work is done,
then, from the hour of *zi* (子) onward,
until the hour of *wu* (午),
and during the hours of *chou* (丑), *yin* (寅), *shen* (申), *wei* (巳), and *hai* (亥),
one sits cross-legged in a quiet chamber,
sealing its doors securely,
closing the eyes and gripping the *qi*,
containing the *essence*,
preserving the *spirit*,
and visualizing the *true qi* of the *five zang* organs⁵
emanating from the *central palace*,
revealing itself before one.

Like the auspicious clouds of five colors
arising from the *crucible*,
this is the method by which a man
conceives a male child.⁶

Then, the *day soul* and *moon spirit*,
the *qi* of water and fire,
transform into the forms of gold and wood.⁷

The *day soul*—yang, the *qi* of fire—
the *moon spirit*—yin, the *qi* of water—
water and fire, mutually generating and restraining each other.

When the internal refinement is complete,
the sun becomes an infant,
the moon a *young maiden*,⁸
never leaving the *nuptial chamber*,
and one sees the *Golden Male*⁹ within the *Jade Hall*.
The maiden is pregnant.

After ten months, she gives birth to the *True Man*,
whose name is *Zhengyang*.¹⁰
This is the essence of the *great medicine*,
the fundamental root of cultivating the Dao and nurturing life.

Those who recognize the elusive *lead-mercury*¹¹
are the true *Dragon* and *Tiger*.¹²

How does one know that gold and wood are formed,
and water and fire transformed?
Is it when the *true yang qi*¹³
of *jiǎ* (甲) and *gēng* (庚) interact?

Grass Cloth Child¹⁴ said:
On the moon’s third day,
the moon appears in the *southwest* at *gēng* (庚),
this is called *obtaining a companion*—
why?
The moon is the *true qi* of water,
the source that generates metal.¹⁵
Thus, when it appears at *gēng*,
this is the *upper arc*, yielding eight *liang* (两) of metal.¹⁶

On the twenty-eighth day, it appears at *jiǎ* (甲),
this is called *losing a companion*—
why?
*Jiǎ* is wood,
and its *essence* is the sun,
revealing itself in the *north*—¹⁷
the sun, the *true qi* of fire,
overcomes metal.
Thus, on the twenty-eighth day,
the moon appears in the *north* and brightens,
the yang reveals itself,
and the moon vanishes—
this is the *lower arc*,
yielding eight *liang* of silver.¹⁸

Metal and silver combine into sixteen *liang*,
and the *yin-yang lines*¹⁹ of each are 192—
altogether, this makes 384 *zhu* (铢).
This is the sixteen *liang* count.

I observe the *arcs*, *fullness*, *towering*, *deficiency*, *eclipse*, and *occultation*²⁰ of the moon,
and at the hour of *zi* (子),
I stabilize my *spirit* and *breath*,
until the hour of *wu* (午),
I contain my *qi*—
reaching a thousand breaths,
the count of gold and silver will not be lost.

Still, I cannot fail to understand
the transformations of the sun, moon,
*eight trigrams*, and *yin-yang*.
Eleven months have passed,
when the *Big Dipper*²¹ stands at *zi* (子).」

The Earth Thunder, *Fù* (復), is the **restoration** one.
Here, one *yang* begins to arise,
**clashing** with five *yin*.
Thus, all times of *zi* (子) are the initial moments of *yang*,
and I begin my work at these hours.
When the **golden elixir**¹ appears,
the medicine has its **root**².

I **refine** it into the furnace,
to **nourish** the **true gold**³.
The second month is when the *Big Dipper* stands at *mǎo* (卯).
The Earth Heaven, *Tài* (泰), is the **harmonious** one.
The upper is three *yin*—**Earth**—
the lower is three *yang*—**Heaven**.
Here, *yin* and *yang* **clash** and **struggle**⁴.
The *yin-yang lines*⁵ of each are ninety-six.
The *yin* is **gold four *liang***⁶,
the *yang* is **silver four *liang***.
All times of *mǎo* (卯) are the *Tài* (泰) **hexagram**⁷.
This is the **conjunction**⁸,
where the initial **settlement**⁹ is made in three **returns**¹⁰.
If the *yang* seeks to **prevail**,
it **reverts** to the **origin**¹¹,
thus silver **manifests** while gold **conceals**¹²,
its form like a **calabash**¹³.
I **refine** the **spiritual sand**¹⁴,
to **subdue** the **elixir field**¹⁵.

The fourth month is when the *Big Dipper* stands at *sì* (巳).
The **pure *yang***, *Qián* (乾), is the **completion** one.
*Qián* (乾) is **gold**,
the **White Sovereign of the Origin**¹⁶ appears,
and **true sentiment**¹⁷ is **pleased**.
It **unites** with the four directions,
its **water**¹⁸ **refined by Heaven**.
All times of *sì* (巳),
the **great medicine**¹⁹ **reverses** and **rotates rightward**²⁰,
entering the **elixir field**²¹,
penetrating to the **tailbone**²²,
then **transported**²³, it **reenters** the **Upper Origin’s Kunlun**²⁴.
This is the **return** that **reverses** and **supplements** at the **muddy pellet**²⁵.

The fifth month is when the *Big Dipper* stands at *wǔ* (午).
The Heaven Wind, *Gòu* (姤), is the **meeting** one.
One *yin* **clashes** with five *yang*.
Before the hour of *wǔ* (午),
one *yin* begins to arise,
thus I **discern** the *yin-yang* **origins**²⁶ in the three **stages**²⁷
to **conduct** my work.
How do I **conduct** my work?
By **using lead to seek lead**²⁸.
When one *yin* arises,
then *Qián* (乾) is **broken**.
**Gold** appears in **Earth**,
not **returning** to its **mother**²⁹,
the **golden elixir** transforms
and **enters** the **Jade Spring**³⁰.

The seventh month is when the *Big Dipper* stands at *shēn* (申).
The Heaven Earth, *Pǐ* (否), is the **blocked** one.
Three *yang* are in the upper,
three *yin* are in the lower,
a **struggle** between *yang* and *yin*.
When its **upper arc**³¹ appears,
it is **gold eight *liang***³²,
and **silver sixteen *liang***³³.
All times of *shēn* (申) are the *Pǐ* (否) **hexagram**³⁴,
this is the **seventh return**³⁵!
An **infant**³⁶ and an **old woman**³⁷ share one **pit**³⁸.
At the hour of *shēn* (申),
I **refine** the **fire’s candidate**³⁹,
and the **elixir** is **completed**,
**ascending** to the **Three Cleansings**⁴⁰.

The tenth month is when the *Big Dipper* stands at *hài* (亥).
The **pure *yin***, *Kūn* (坤), is the **receptive** one.
All times of *hài* (亥) are the *Kūn* (坤) **hexagram**⁴¹.
The **great medicine** **follows** the west
and **rotates rightward**²⁰,
**ascending** the **double pavilion**⁴²,

then **descending** to the **Vermilion Palace**⁴⁴,
**paying homage** to the **Sovereign of the Red City**⁴⁵,
and **refined**, it **enters** the **elixir field**,
this is the **ninth return**⁴⁶.

The second month is when the *Big Dipper* stands at *mǎo* (卯).
The Fire Water, *Wèijì* (未济), is the **unfinished** one.

---

**Fire** abides in the **upper**, **water** in the **lower**—
its **hexagram** does not **act** upon **Fire**,
yet its name is *Kāilú* (开炉, "Opening the Furnace").

At all times of *mǎo* (卯),
**qi** is made to **emit** the **pure** and **impure**,
**nourishing** its **blood**,
to **augment** the **transformation** of **metallic essence**⁴⁷.

The *Wèijì* (未济, "Unfinished") is the **cauldron**⁴⁸.
When the **Four Symbols**⁴⁹ obtain **Earth**,
they **intermingle** and **unify**⁵⁰.
The **Central Palace**⁵¹, *wù-jǐ* (戊己),
is the **master** of the **medicine**⁵².

Only in the **cauldron** must there be no **sound of water**⁵³.
The eighth month is when the *Big Dipper* stands at *yǒu* (酉).
The **Water-Fire**, *Jìzhì* (既济, "Completed"), is the **true cauldron**⁵⁴.
The **nine-one**⁵⁵ **count** is **fulfilled**—
the **Dragon** and **Tiger**⁵⁶ have **descended**⁵⁷.
This is the **beginning** of **cultivating the True**⁵⁸,
called the **First Stage**⁵⁹.
Its **essence** lies in **knowing** the **affections of the *couple***⁶⁰.
My **medicine** reaches here and is **perfected**⁶¹.
Thus, I **transform** **True *qi*** into **inner fire**⁶²,
to **consum** my **body**⁶³.
What is **inner fire**?⁶⁴
It is the **circulating** **pure *yang*** of the **Five Organs**⁶⁵.
When its **yin** is **exhausted**⁶⁶,
then **blood** **transforms** into **essence**⁶⁷,
**essence** into **marrow**⁶⁸,
**marrow** **converts** into **body**⁶⁹,
to **produce** **white milk**⁷⁰,
and when the **work** is **fulfilled**,
the **body** becomes **lucid**⁷¹.
When **cold**, it **circulates** in **Heart *qi***,
when **hot**, it **circulates** in **Kidney *qi***,
naturally **neither cold nor hot**⁷².
When it **circulates** in the **fire’s candidate**⁷³ **qi**,
then **fire** **arises** of itself⁷⁴.
And the **Primordial Sovereign**⁷⁵—
the **Dragon** **swallows**, the **Tiger** **receives**⁷⁶,
dwelling with the **Three Officials**⁷⁷ in the **Golden Hall**⁷⁸—
after **a thousand days**⁷⁹,
**purple clouds** **emerge** from the **foot**⁸⁰.

(*Dao* **Gū**⁸¹, Scroll 33, ends here.)
(*Dao* **Gū**, Scroll 34, reaches the *Yóuzǐ* **Zēng**⁸² **Collection**.)

**The Lower Scroll of *The Canon of the Mysterious Concord* says:**

The Master Yunya Zi, surnamed Wei Ao, style name Boyang, a man of Han, who styled himself Yunya Zi, wandered the Changbai Mountains and encountered a True Person, who taught him the principles of lead and mercury, the mechanics of Dragon and Tiger. Thus, he composed eighteen chapters, speaking of the Great Dao.

That which is vague and indistinct—this is lead and mercury;
That which is dim and obscure—this is Dragon and Tiger.
These are the root sources of yin and yang transformation.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Boyang, having composed *The Canon of the Mysterious Concord*, Yuan Yang Zi annotated its meaning:

Yin and yang—from black arises white, this is the number one of water. Water generates metal, its number three.
Water is called *li* generated from *kun*, as earth, as yin, as mother, as female; its vital breath is metal.
Metal is in the northwest, belonging to *qian*, as heaven, as yang, as father, as male.

Thus it is said:
The *li* palace holds its form, concealed in true water;
The *kan* gate contains its bloom, hidden in true metal.
With *qian* generating three sons, *kun* generating three daughters,
Transforming into the eight trigrams, mutually nurturing to complete the number eight.

Yunya Zi said: Cinnabar, black tin, and realgar—when refined and forged within, they become the two *qi*.
Yuan Chang Zi said: This is within oneself, not sought from without.

Yunya Zi said: When it transforms into white snow, yellow sprouts, at the time of lowering the fire, one must be especially cautious.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Cinnabar and black tin are tempered by realgar, then further forged with gentle fire—its transformation into white snow, its completion into yellow sprouts.
Realgar is earth, the five returning to one.

Yunya Zi said: Though it alters the form of the River Vehicle, when seven returns are complete, it follows the reversal of *Ji Ji*.
Yuan Yang Zi said: When it shows the *yin* (leap-year), this is wood; when it shows the *shen* (applicator), this is metal.
Metal can subdue wood; through seven returns, it is concealed within.
The liver and lungs—externally, they bind the west.
Metal is essence; wood is fluid.
When fluid and essence merge, they form the elixir stone.
Why? Essence descends from the *li* palace, producing lead; fluid ascends from the *kan* palace, producing mercury.
*Li* and *kan*—the cauldron of *Water and Fire Both Accomplished*;
The River Vehicle—the true *qi* of the north.
Turning into the *shu* palace, its land of *jia* and *yi*—thus, the golden flower arises!

Yunya Zi said: Nine transformations yield the purple-gold sand, refined into treasure—its gold fills the home.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Lead, mercury, and realgar—when forged, they become the Great Medicine, returning to *qian* and *kun*.
Its yang, 192 *zhu*, is eight *liang* of gold;
Its yin, 192 *zhu*, is eight *liang* of silver.
Combined with the 384 of the trigrams and lines, the return elixir is complete.

Yunya Zi said: First, distinguish the medicine, then observe its sprouts—only then does one know the root, the key.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Beneath the elixir field, the left is *suo*, the right is *yào*; within is a platform.
Hidden in the roots of sun and moon, day and night revolve, the four seasons encircle—refined in the three fields.
This is the essence of the three souls, the source of the Great Medicine.
What is the Great Medicine? *Fu ling* calms the soul, *ren shen* steadies the spirit—but these are not of the mundane world.
*Fu ling*—black within, white without;
*Ren shen*—red-yellow without, white-green within.
When the sprouts appear, one must then discern their roots.

Yunya Zi said: Those who gather must use the sixteen *zhen* of truth.
Within the medicine, there is curd and ghee.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The sixteen—*mao* and *you*, the number sixteen.
This is metal subduing wood; above, applied to *mao*; below, applied to *you*.
*Mao* is the blood of the Dragon; *you* is the blood of the Tiger.
When the two bodies merge, they become curd, ghee—the souls and spirits of sun and moon.
The Southern Palace is the sun, *li*;
The Northern Palace is the moon, *kan*.
Thus, the foundation of water and fire is established, merging the kinds of lead and mercury.

Yunya Zi said: Within the gentle and martial fires, do they regulate each other?

Yuan Yang Zi said: The gentle and martial fires are the functions of the four seasons.
When sealed, *qi* is received, following the nine-one count.
To gather the fluid of wood and fire;
Their regulation—merging the essence of metal and water—this is the lower function.
Entering the central palace, using earth, the Great Medicine is formed.

Yunya Zi said: Slowly pounding—its function and count must not differ—only then is it acceptable.

Yuan Yang Zi said: This is the count of the function.
When sealed, *qi* is received, counted silently with the mind—nine breaths, one swallow, increasing daily until a hundred breaths, then receiving *qi*.
Performing daily sun-moon guiding and drawing, gathering the essence of yin and yang transformation, the essence of sun and moon—thus, the fluid of gold, the essence of jade, gathered in nine-one—this is slow pounding.
Again, performing three-one—this is the gentle and martial fires.
Fire is breath, true earth.

Yunya Zi said: Blending the jade-fluid nectar, forging it into elixir sand.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Jade-fluid—its name is *qiongjiang*, its name is *tianjiu*—this is the water of the Flowered Pool.
Having gathered the medicine, one must then invest fluid and essence.
Sealing the breath, storing and drawing it, obtaining earth to merge—using breath as fire to forge and refine.

Yunya Zi said: The Golden Elixir Refining begins with lead and mercury as its foundation. When taken, the crow becomes a phoenix, the serpent becomes a dragon.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The Refined Elixir forms the Vermilion Bird—what I have seen is the phoenix. I have ridden the *là* serpent, and seen it become the dragon.

Yunya Zi said: The four seasons are the times for practice—spring and autumn.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The four seasons are the *Lì* of spring, the *Lì* of summer, the *Lì* of autumn, and the *Lì* of winter. These are called the four seasons.

Each season comprises seventy-two days, forming the four symbols of Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water—these are called the beginnings of the four *Mèng* periods.

The *Yín-Shēn* (third and ninth earthly branches) are the great medicine where Wood and Metal clash. This great medicine is the cycle of two hundred eighty-eight years.

In my minor practice, I use it at the four *Mèng* periods, each forty-five days—totaling one hundred ninety days. The sun and moon in the four seasons also amount to one hundred ninety days.

Moreover, the subtle numbers of yin-yang creation and eternal life—I practice here.

Yunya Zi said: *Wèi-Hài* (fourth and eleventh earthly branches) are the return—this is the beginning of the Eight Trigrams.

Yuan Yang Zi said: *Wèi* is Fire, the fourth month, the essence of pure yang. Its trigram corresponds to *Qián* (Heaven) and becomes the Heavenly. *Hài* is Water, the tenth month, the essence of pure yin. Its trigram corresponds to *Kūn* (Earth) and becomes the Earthly.

When Heaven and Earth unite, the six yang and six yin are complete.

From *Zǐ* (eleventh branch) to *Wèi* (fourth branch), it begins with the trigram *Dì-Léi Fù-Gōng* (Earth-Thunder Returning), with six yang lines—this is half a year’s count.

From *Wǔ* (seventh branch) to *Hài* (eleventh branch), it begins with the trigram *Tiān-Fēng Xiàn* (Wind-Gentle), with six yin lines—this is half a year’s count.

Thus, the Golden Elixir attains the nine returns of true *qi*—this is the completion of Water and Fire in *Jí-Jì* (Mutual Aid). Water and Fire countering each other, when controlled in their true forms, then the measure of one *jīn* is achieved.

Yunya Zi said: The moon gathers at *Jiǎ-Gēng* (first and seventh heavenly stems), the sun gathers at *Rén-Bǐng* (second and sixth heavenly stems)—do we seek this in the four symbols through mutual counteraction and containment?

Yuan Yang Zi said: *Jiǎ* is Wood, occupying the *shùběi* (束北) position. When the moon reaches the twenty-eighth day, it loses its companion in *shùběi*. Why? Because yang is born while yin is extinguished.

「Regeng (Gēng) is Metal, occupying the southwest position. When the moon reaches the third day, it finds its companion in the southwest. Why? Because yin is born while yang is extinguished.

Rén is Water, born from the sun’s *arcan* (魂). Bǐng is Fire, born from the moon’s *pò* (魄). The *qi* of Metal is thus the yin within yang, known as the sun’s *arcan*; the *qi* of Wood is the yang within yin, known as the moon’s *pò*.

Hence it is said: When the *yin-yang* (阴阳) *zàohuà* (造化) arise, their birth is divided between *Kǎn* (坎) and *Lí* (离). The counteraction of *Kùn* (坤) is to contain and nurture—*bāo* (包) means to *cáng* (藏). Rén (壬) gives birth to Jiǎ (甲), Bǐng (丙) gives birth to Gēng (庚). This is the mutual seeking of the four symbols: Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire.

When they enter the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫) *dǐng* (鼎), the Great Elixir can be forged.

The *Sūtra* (经) states: Wood is the Azure Dragon, Metal is the White Tiger, the sun is the Vermilion Bird, and the moon is the Dark Tortoise. When the four symbols converge at the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫), their *chángshēng* (长生) does not depart from the *wù-jǐ* (戊己) Earth. Those who refine the elixir must recognize the Tiger. When yang obtains its yin, it naturally contains the *hù* (互).

Yunya Zi said: When Water and Fire are reversed, the true *dǐng* (鼎) vessel is formed; the *Héchē* (河车) moves, yet *wù-jǐ* (戊己) remains.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The four symbols are born from *wù-jǐ* (戊己), thus making *Zhōnggōng* (中宫) the honored center. Therefore, the four symbols are refined and formed by controlling *wù-jǐ* (戊己)—without *wù-jǐ* (戊己), the four symbols have no master.

Wù (戊) is Earth; Jǐ (己) is dung. When combined, they form one—this is the *Lǎozi* (老子) saying: *"The Dao obtains One and becomes clear; Earth obtains One and becomes tranquil; the Spirit obtains One and becomes responsive"* (天得一以清，地得一以宁，神得一以灵).

The reason the four symbols merge into one is that all things arise from the *shàng* (上, upper) realm. Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire entering the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫) is called returning to the *dǐng* (鼎). The *dǐng* (鼎) is the *Dāntián* (丹田). Yunya Zi said: The Azure Dragon and White Tiger are born in the south and north, seized and contained within each other, and wander within the *dǐng* (鼎).

Yuan Yang Zi said: The Azure Dragon is Wood, born from the *Kǎn* (坎) *hù* (户); the White Tiger is Metal, born from the *Lí* (离) *gōng* (宫). Thus, the Azure Dragon is lead, born from the north; the White Tiger is mercury, born from the south.

Mercury generates *shā* (砂), its exterior red and corresponding to yang, while its interior produces *shuǐyín* (水银). Lead arises from *shílì* (石砺), its exterior black and corresponding to yin, refining into *báixī* (白锡). Lead is the *jīn* (津), named *Yùyè* (玉液) or *Huápú* (华池) water; mercury is the *jīng* (精), named *Zēngqīng* (曾青) or *Fǎshuǐ* (法水)—these two are one in essence.

At the *Zhōngyuán* (中元) *Cháo* (朝) to the Red Sovereign, when divided between upper and lower, the upper is the yang of lead, and the lower is the yin of mercury. When yin and yang harmonize and obtain *Huángpó* (黄婆), the Great Elixir is formed. This is the Dragon and Tiger wandering within the *dǐng* (鼎).

Yunya Zi said: The Metal Sovereign seeks *Huángpó* (黄婆) to meet with the Jade Maiden.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The Metal Sovereign is lead, also named *Yīng’ér* (婴儿); the Jade Maiden is mercury. When lead and mercury merge and enter the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫), *Huángpó* (黄婆) resides within the *dǐng* (鼎). The center of the *dǐng* (鼎) is the *Dāntián* (丹田) and Earth. One gives birth to Five; Five merge into One—this is called the Ten *Gān* (干, stems). This is the Six *Hé* (合) count.

This is the essence of the sun’s *arcan* (魂), moon’s *pò* (华), sun’s *pò* (魄), moon’s *arcan* (津), silver exterior, and gold interior.

Yunya Zi said: The birth of lead and mercury originates from one essence.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Lead and mercury are the roots of the *Xiàyuán* (下元) *Mìngmén* (命门). At the center of *Qìyuè* (弃钥), they are born from the two kidneys: the left is *Rén* (壬), the right is *Guǐ* (癸). The two *qi* of the kidneys merge into one, forming lead and mercury. They ascend and descend, flying and surging, dividing between south and north, paired at the *Lí* (离) *gōng* (宫) and *Kǎn* (坎) *hù* (户). When they rise and fall, lead and mercury transform.

Lead is yang, named the Metal Sovereign or *Yīng’ér* (婴儿); mercury is yin, named the *Lí* (离) Maiden or *Lǎonǚ* (姥女).

The *Sūtra* (经) states: *"Kǎn* (坎) male and *Lí* (离) female as husband and wife—Water and Fire form them, *Huángpó* (黄婆) as their mother. Those who can preserve this are true Water and Fire."

Yunya Zi said: Gold and silver are the true *Zōng* (宗) of the *Dharma* (法).

They ascend and descend, flying and surging—are these not the two names?

Yuan Yang Zi said: Gold and silver are the *yin-yang* (阴阳) *qi*; upper and lower are the two *xián* (弦, cords). The moon’s third day is seen at *Gēng* (庚); the twenty-eighth day is seen at *Jiǎ* (甲). On the eighth and twenty-second days, it appears at the *Lí* (离) *gōng* (宫). This is the *yin-yang* (阴阳) *biànzhuǎn* (变转), *zàohuà* (造化) forming shapes.

For the first fifteen days, it waxes full; for the latter fifteen days, it wanes. This is the foundation of the Two *Bā* (八), the count of *yin-yang* (阴阳), where all six lines are complete.

Thus, the sun’s *arcan* (魂) and moon’s *pò* (魄) are born from *Kǎn* (坎) and *Lí* (离), the *qi* of Metal and Wood, formed by Water and Fire into an embryonic sac. Nurtured and transformed, they produce the color of the *Huándān* (还丹) and become the Elixir of the Four Spirits.

Yunya Zi said: When *yin-yang* (阴阳) reverse and transform, they form the Nine *Yù* (域). The *Kǎn* (坎) *hù* (户) and *Lí* (离) *gōng* (宫) display their transformative interplay.

Yuan Yang Zi said: It is the gathering of the true *zhèngqì* (正气) of *yin-yang* (阴阳), preserving essence to complete it. Their count is based on the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six; their timing on *Yín* (寅), *Shēn* (申), *Sì* (巳), and *Hài* (亥).

To forge this, one must first temper the lower Fire, restraining lead from flying and mercury from fleeing. Only when they settle harmoniously in the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫) *dǐng* (鼎) can they transform into the white tooth of the horse, using its *Dāoguī* (刀圭) to naturally produce *Yùyè* (玉液)—this is named *Huángyá* (黄芽).

To achieve the seven returns, one must begin at *Yín* (寅). The hexagram corresponds to *Tài* (泰), the position where three yin and three yang merge. Internally, it corresponds to the liver; externally, it manifests as *Mǎo* (卯).」

Thus, *Yín* (寅) is the Wood, the longest of the four *Mèng* (孟) months; *Zhèn* (震) is the second, so one may use *Yín* (寅) but not *Mǎo* (卯).

*Shēn* (申) corresponds to the hexagram *Pǐ* (否), where after *Pǐ* (否) reaches its extreme, *Tài* (泰) arrives, and *Tài* (泰) follows *Pǐ* (否). Their union shifts with the times, hence the three *yīn* (阴) and three *yáng* (阳) alternate and give birth. Internally, it corresponds to the lungs; externally, it belongs to *Yǒu* (酉). *Yǒu* (酉) is the Metal of the west; *Shēn* (申) is the longest; *Duì* (兑) is the second. One may use *Shēn* (申) but not *Yǒu* (酉).

From *Yín* (寅) to *Shēn* (申), the Dragon and Tiger suffice within themselves to form the seven returns. The numinous sand undergoes two transformations and returns to the Nine Realms. The Nine Realms are the gateways of the ninefold alchemical process: the first is *Gǔshén* (谷神), the second *Qián Guān* (乾关), the third *Huápéi* (华池), the fourth *Pìn Mén* (牝门), the fifth *Hún Chuāng* (魂窗), the sixth *Tiān Hù* (天户), the seventh *Zhī Yǒu* (知牖), the eighth *Xīyí* (希夷), and the ninth is the Nine Realms itself.

From darkness, the nine-colored *qīng* (青) arise—white, yellow, red, black, green, blue, and purple—entering through this. They originate from the interplay of the heart and kidneys, known as the *Lí Guān* (离宫) and *Kǎn Hù* (坎户). *Lí* (离) is *yīn* (阴), the heart; *Kǎn* (坎) is *yáng* (阳), the kidneys, and the transformation of *yīn-yáng* (阴阳).

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: The souls of the sun and moon are what the immortals cherish. They can refine the Three Fields to produce a jade bead, which the immortals consume as their *Dāoguī* (刀圭).

Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: The sun’s soul and moon’s essence are the vital essence (*jīng* 精), the vital *qi* (*qì* 气), the true *qi* of *yīn-yáng* (阴阳), and the root of humanity. This essence and *qi* circulate within the Three Palaces; refining them returns them to the *Dāntián* (丹田), thus forming *Zǐjīn* (紫金)—a substance round and square, filling an inch, weighing a pound. This is the gathering of the true *yīn-yáng* (阴阳) *qi* to completion.

The *Zhōnggōng* (中宫) *dǐng* (鼎) is named *Dāoguī* (刀圭). *Dāoguī* (刀圭) is the Earth, also called *Huángyá* (黄芽).

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: The sun’s soul and moon’s essence emerge from *Kǎn-Lí* (坎离). Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: Wooden *qi* arises from the *Kǎn Hù* (坎户) and ascends, corresponding externally to lead (*qiān* 铅), called *Yùyè* (玉液). It resides in *Huápéi* (华池), the left orifice, named the sun’s soul.

Pure Metal emerges from the *Kǎn-Lí* (坎离) Palaces, corresponding externally to mercury (*gǒng* 汞), called *Jīnyè* (金液). In the four seasons, its ascent and descent, circulation and response, never leave the *Dāntián* (丹田)—the child of the *Dāntián* (丹田).

From the right orifice, ascending, it is named the moon’s essence. Its thirst transforms into flowing *zhū* (朱), entering the mud to become bone, then into *jīnmì* (金髓), and finally into pearls. Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: Through the interplay of *Rén* (壬) and *Bǐng* (丙), entering *Xīyí* (希夷), *Jiǎ* (甲) meets *Gēng* (庚), and the divine mechanism shifts.

Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: *Bǐng* (丙) is Fire, the *Lí* (离) Palace; *Rén* (壬) is Water, the *Kǎn* (坎) Palace, the kidneys. When Water and Fire are harmonized (*Jìjí* 既济), the medicine is complete, hence *Xīyí* (希夷). *Xīyí* (希夷) is the root of the Five Phases, born from Earth.

The ninefold alchemical process also forms here, becoming the *Huándān* (还丹). The Fields are Wood; *Gēng* (庚) is Metal. When Metal and Wood mutually restrain each other, true refinement is achieved! Metal and Wood are the medicine’s foundation; understanding this to refine lead and mercury, one attains the divine mechanism.

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: The *Fù* (复) hexagram’s line and the pregnant *tǐ* (体) are the two bases. Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: The *Fù* (复) line is the month of *Jiànzǐ* (建子), where *yáng* (阳) first emerges. It is the precursor to *Zǐ* (子).

The pregnant *tǐ* (体) is the month of *Jiànwǔ* (建午), where *yīn* (阴) first emerges. It is the precursor to *Wǔ* (午).

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: The six times can be used to regulate their *qì* (息气). Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: The six times are the numbers of the Six Coordinates (*Liùhé* 六合).

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: *Mǎo* (卯) and *Yǒu* (酉) stir and overturn, corresponding to their marrow within the Three Fields, allowing mutual refinement. When the Dragon and Tiger appear, they can be seized.

Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: *Mǎo* (卯) is Wood, corresponding to the second month; *Yǒu* (酉) is Metal, corresponding to the eighth month. They mutually refine each other. Wood transforms its *qi* into liquid, called lead (*qiān* 铅), which is *yáng* (阳) and the true *qi* of the Azure Dragon. Metal transforms its *qi* into blood, and its blood into essence, called mercury (*gǒng* 汞), which is *yīn* (阴) and the true *qi* of the White Tiger. Through sixfold transformations and refinements, one can eliminate the Three Worms (*sān chóng* 三虫).

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: The Dragon is born in Fire, revealing its divine light; the Tiger is born in Water, with a firm and resolute nature.

Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: The Dragon is Wood, *qi* (气), ascending from the *Lí Guān* (离宫) and entering *Tiānguān* (天关). Its transformation yields *jīn* (津). Beneath my tongue are two orifices: the left governs *jīn* (津), the right governs *qi* (气). Within the *yín* (阴) are two orifices: the left receives *jīn* (津) and *yè* (液), the right generates tears and saliva.

Wood arises from the *Kǎn Hù* (坎户), residing in *Gèn* (艮), and *Yín* (寅) should be used. *Yín* (寅) is true Wood; use its *qì* (息) to cook it. *Qì* (息) is Fire, and its *jīn* (津) is like silver. The upper condensation forms *sū* (酥), the lower yields *yè* (液)—this is the *Tàiyáng* (太阳) *sū* (酥), which combines with essence to become *dān* (丹), thus revealing divine light.

The Tiger is the moon’s radiance, the *qi* of Metal. When Metal and Wood mutually refine each other, their *qi* and essence combine within the *dǐng* (鼎), and its color becomes like *yúnmǔ* (云母).

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: When *Bǐng* (丙) and *Rén* (壬) converge, the two *qi* (气) transform. Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: *Bǐng* (丙) is *Lí* (离), Fire, and the heart; *Rén* (壬) is *Kǎn* (坎), Water, and the kidneys. When Water and Fire mutually restrain each other, *Jìjí* (既济) is achieved. *Kǎn* (坎) produces lead (*qiān* 铅), *Lí* (离) produces mercury (*gǒng* 汞). Refining lead yields white silver, and mercury returns to *zhūshā* (朱砂). When these two are combined and tempered, they form the sand of the two *qi* (气).

Yun Yang Zi (云牙子) said: Within the *Tián* (田), the horse’s tooth sprouts like bamboo shoots. Yuan Yang Zi (元阳子) said: The sand of the two *qi* (气), when moved into the *Dāntián* (丹田), is tempered like the sprouting of bamboo, like the white horse’s tooth.

Yun Yang Zi said: When Metal and Wood interact, they return to the *Dǐng* (鼎); Water and *Kǎn* (坎) are tempered and enter the *Xióngkēng* (雄坑).

Yuan Yang Zi said: Metal is Water, mercury is Yin; Wood is Fire, lead is Yang. Metal becomes *jīng* (精), Wood becomes *jīn* (津). The Four Symbols are tempered and moved into the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫) *Dǐng* (鼎), where breath is closed and *qi* (气) is preserved, entering the *Xióngkēng* (雄坑). The *Xióngkēng* (雄坑) is the *Dǐng* (鼎), the Earth.

Yun Yang Zi said: When the Five Phases unite harmoniously, transformation becomes possible. *Yùyè* (玉液) and *yúnshā* (云砂) merge through the Nine Circulations.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The medicine descends from the *Shíngōng* (肾宫), and thus the *Yùquán* (玉泉) congeals. The *qi* of Metal enters and exits the *Lígōng* (离宫), descending through the kidneys to become blood, which transforms into *jīng* (精)—this is called *Jīnjīng* (金精). When it congeals above, it becomes *zēngqīng* (曾青); when it forms below, it becomes *fǎshuǐ* (法水). Its nature is to ascend; when refined to firmness and rigidity, it becomes a treasure.

Yun Yang Zi said: When the two beasts meet, they naturally subdue each other, manifesting before the *Huángjūn* (黄君), and thus vitality flourishes.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The Dragon descends, the Tiger ascends—they meet, and thus naturally unite into One. This is the act of subduing. The *Huángjūn* (黄君) is the Earth of the *Dǐng* (鼎). When lead and mercury are subdued by Earth, they return to the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫). Why? When I close my breath to a thousand inhalations, lead and mercury flow upward and downward through the Three *Tián* (田), returning to the *Xiàyuán* (下元), entering the *Lántái* (兰台) to form *Zǐjīn* (紫金), and vitality flourishes.

Yun Yang Zi said: Follow the transformations of the Three Officials (*Sānguān* 三官), fasting to consume *Yùyè* (玉液) without haste.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The Three Palaces (*Sāngōng* 三宫) are: the upper *Níwán* (泥丸), the middle *Jiāngōng* (绛宫), and the lower *Lántái Shíshì* (兰台石室). The daily *jīng* (精) and monthly *huá* (华) circulate above and below, paying homage to the *Yuánjūn* (元君), with the *Chìdìjūn* (赤帝君) residing in the middle and the *Huángyuánjūn* (黄元君) below. Nourish *jīng* (精) through *qi* (气), and *shén* (神) through *jīng* (精). When *shén* (神) can transform, the Three thrice Three become Nine. The scholar need only cultivate *qi* (气) and still the breath, swallowing the harmonious *chōng* (冲) *qi* when hungry, drinking the *Huápó* (华池) elixir when thirsty. Thus, one may transform *qi* into blood, blood into *jīng* (精), *jīng* (精) to nourish the vessels, the vessels to replenish the flesh, the flesh to enrich the marrow, the marrow to strengthen the sinews, the sinews to moisten the hair, and the hair to return to blackness. Then, when *Jīngǔ* (金骨) is complete, aging is reversed into youth.

When one closes the breath and silently counts to a thousand inhalations, the Five Grains are naturally dispelled, and hunger and thirst vanish. Boiling *Yùyè* (玉液) moistens the Five *Zàng* (藏) and benefits the Six *Fǔ* (府). At ten thousand inhalations, one may attain immortality.

Yun Yang Zi said: Close the *Tiānguān* (天关), seal the *Dìhù* (地户)—the medicine is not yet complete; do not act recklessly.

Yuan Yang Zi said: If *Tiānguān* (天关) does not close and *Dìhù* (地户) does not seal, this is the key to cultivating life. As for feasting on clouds, ingesting *qi*, and using medicines to abstain from grains—these are the actions of the mad, far from immortality. Thus the *Jīng* (经) says: *"Only use the mercury within the body; do not take it from external realms."*

Yun Yang Zi said: *Jīnjīn* (金津) arises from the *Kǎnhù* (坎户), *Yùyè* (玉液) is produced in the *Lígōng* (离宫).

Yuan Yang Zi said: *Jīnjīn* (金津) is *jīng* (精); *Kǎn* (坎) is the kidneys; *Yùyè* (玉液) comes from the *Lígōng* (离宫), merging with *jīng* (精) to return to the *Zhōnggōng* (中宫) and form the Great Elixir (*Dàdān* 大丹). The Great Elixir is lead and mercury.

Yun Yang Zi said: The two are originally One, divided into the Two Principles (*Èryí* 二仪).

Yuan Yang Zi said: Lead becomes *jīn* (津), mercury becomes *jīng* (精)—transformed through *qi* (气). When they reach the *Lígōng* (离宫), they are again divided above and below—this is the creation of Yin and Yang! One substance with two forms. When they unite, using breath to refine them, the Great Medicine is complete, the Five Grains are dispelled, and the Three Worms (*Sānchóng* 三虫) perish.

Yun Yang Zi said: In the realm of *huǎnghū* (恍惚), there is form within the obscure; in the *yǎomíng* (杳冥), there is substance within the void.

Yuan Yang Zi said: *Huǎnghū* contains substance—its emptiness is real, called *Yángqì* (阳气); *Yǎomíng* contains *jīng* (精)—its nothingness is real, called *Yīnjīng* (阴精). *Jīng* (精) and *qi* (气) unite to form *shén* (神). *Shén* (神) is breath; breath is Earth, is Fire. Fire nourishes Earth, Earth preserves Fire. Thus, one substance becomes three!

Yun Yang Zi said: Within the void is real *jīng* (精); within the nothing is the Way made manifest.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The void becomes real through circulating *jīng* (精) to nourish the brain! The nothing becomes manifest through *qi* (气) transforming into *jīn* (津), *jīn* (津) into blood, and blood into *jīng* (精). *Jīng* (精) is *shén* (神); when *shén* (神) is preserved, the body is healthy; when *shén* (神) departs, the body perishes. If one can nourish *jīng* (精) and *qi* (气) while preserving *shén* (神), the Way is naturally complete. Thus it is said: *"Pure Yin does not form an embryo; pure Yang does not congeal the elixir."*

Yun Yang Zi said: Following the body of Creation, Yin and Yang transform harmoniously, and vitality flourishes.

Yuan Yang Zi said: When *jīng* (精) and *qi* (气) interact, *zhèngqì* (正气) is generated. *Zhèngqì* (正气) is the root of humanity. When *zhèngqì* (正气) scatters, *shén* (神) does not gather. *Shénqì* (神息) is life. This is the essence of Metal and Wood! The body, able to create transformation, radiates with vitality and returns to youth.

Yun Yang Zi said: The Nine Returns and Seven Circulations are the functions of *Qiánkūn* (乾坤).

Yuan Yang Zi said: From *Yín* (寅) to *Shēn* (申), and from *Shēn* (申) back to *Yín* (寅)—each half-year’s symbol, hence "return." This is ascending along the spine to the *Nǐnhù* (脑户) and descending to the *Yùquán* (玉泉), also called the Seven Circulations. From *Wèi* (巳) to *Hài* (亥), and from *Hài* (亥) back to *Wèi* (巳), entering the *Jīnsuǒgǔ* (金锁骨) from the tail, ascending through the *Níwán* (泥丸) via the twelve chambers of the *Chónglóu* (重楼), paying homage to the *Chìdì* (赤帝), and flowing to the *Dāntián* (丹田).

The essence is then offered to the Yellow Primordial, and afterward enters the Golden Hall. There are seven heavens, where the noble attends to it, storing it in the Treasure Vault—first as the *Shénzhū* (神珠, Divine Pearl), second as the *Bǎoguī* (宝龟, Precious Tortoise), third as the *Hèchì Jīndān* (赫赤金丹, Crimson Golden Elixir). Its light shines in nine hues, hence the term "Nine Returns."

Yun Yang Zi said: *Shénshuǐ* (神水, Divine Water) and *Zēngqīng* (曾青, Azurite) are names of the earth. They flow upward and downward, each moving in their own course.

Yuan Yang Zi said: *Shénshuǐ* is the essence, governing beneath the tongue, ascending inversely from the kidneys, piercing the *Lígōng* (离宫, Palace of Separation), and passing through—its name is the *Huápí zhī jiāng* (华池之浆, Nectar of the Flower Pool). *Zēngqīng* is the essence, ascending inversely from the right kidney, passing through the *Lígōng*, descending again to emerge at the *Yùquán*, and entering the *Xīyí* (希夷, Mysterious Void).

Yun Yang Zi said: *Shénshuǐ* emerges from *Bǐng* (丙) and *Dīng* (丁); *Zēngqīng* emerges from *Rén* (壬) and *Guǐ* (癸).

Yuan Yang Zi said: *Bǐng* is the South, born in *Wèi* (巳); *Dīng* is also the South, born in *Wèi* (未), both belonging to Yang, clinging to *Lí* (离). Its west is Yang, its center is Yin.

This generates *Shénshuǐ*—called *Yùyè* (玉液, Jade Nectar), *Qiān* (铅, Lead), *Lóng* (龙, Dragon), *Yīng’ér* (婴儿, Infant), *Jīngōng* (金公, Golden Lord), *Tàiyáng sū* (太阳酥, Solar Butter).

*Rén* is the North, located in *Hài* (亥); *Guǐ* is also the North, born in *Chǒu* (丑), both belonging to Yin, clinging to *Kǎn* (坎). Its west is Yin, its center is Yang.

This generates *Zēngqīng*—called *Jīnjīn* (金津, Golden River), *Gǒng* (汞, Mercury), *Hǔ* (虎, Tiger), *Chàinǚ* (诧女, Astonished Maiden), *Yùzhì* (玉质, Jade Essence), *Fǎshuǐ* (法水, Sacred Water).

The *Classic* says: The Five Phases—preserving essence, safeguarding spirit—are the Dragon and Tiger. Not understanding the essence of the Five Phases is like taking others as one’s parents!

Water governs *qi*, Metal refines the marrow, Flesh belongs to Earth, Blood belongs to Water. Thus, the Way of Immortality lies within the *Lígōng*.

Knowing the Five Phases, one’s body has its master.

*Huándān* (还丹, Returned Elixir) is the essence of water and mercury; their differing natures cannot be conflated.

Yun Yang Zi said: Within the central palace, seek the cauldron vessels—eight gates facing each other, thus corresponding to the functions.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The central palace’s cauldron is the Yellow Primordial Sovereign. What are the eight gates? They are *Xiū* (休, Rest), *Shēng* (生, Birth), *Shāng* (伤, Injury), *Dù* (杜, Block), *Jǐng* (景, Appearance), *Sǐ* (死, Death), *Jīng* (惊, Alarm), and *Kāi* (开, Opening). Thus, the daily use of the eight trigrams arises from the eight palaces, making the elixir’s operation follow its course.

Yun Yang Zi said: Use water and fire to complete *Jìjí* (既济, Accomplishment).

Yuan Yang Zi said: Water and fire are essence and *qi*, breath and spirit. Upper water, lower fire—refine them to form the elixir, without deviation.

Yun Yang Zi said: When the solar essence and lunar essence merge and are refined, they become *shā* (砂, sand).

Yuan Yang Zi said: Solar essence is Yang, the *qi* of Wood; lunar essence is Yin, the *qi* of Metal.

Yun Yang Zi said: Knowing the white, guarding the black—its name is *Héchē* (河车, River Vehicle).

Yuan Yang Zi said: It is black in Yin, white in Yang. Yang is lead; refining it with fire reveals inner white tin. Thus, one knows to guard the black while knowing the white.

Black is the One of Water; inner is the Four of Metal. Obtaining One to generate One—this is Yin and Yang, the essence of sun and moon. This is the *Héchē*.

The *Classic* says: The true *qi* of the North is the *Héchē*; the Five Directions’ *jiǎ* (甲, first heavenly stem) and *yǐ* (乙, second heavenly stem) form the Golden Flower—this is what is meant.

Yun Yang Zi said: Within the central palace’s circulation, the *Dāntián* generates the Yellow Sprout.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Using solar essence, lunar essence, and the four seasons’ daily rotation to enter the central palace—this is essence, lead, and the *Héchē*. *Rìhuá* (日华, Solar Flower) is mercury, the Golden Flower; the central palace is Earth. When lead and mercury meet Earth, the Yellow Sprout emerges.

Yun Yang Zi said: The *gǔqì* (谷气, grain *qi*) is exhausted; its Yin is spent; the Golden Flower appears.

Yuan Yang Zi said: Knowing lead and mercury—true *qi* generated from the lower *Dāntián*. But by closing the breath and storing the spirit to nourish the *qi*, when the breath is closed to a thousand counts, the dead *qi* of the five grains is eliminated. Neither hungry nor thirsty, the spirit is preserved, and true *qi* is daily reborn. Feeding on the *Yuánhé* (元和, Primordial Harmony) *qi*, drinking the *Tiānpíng* (天池, Heavenly Pool) jade nectar—its fragrance is like chrysanthemum, hence the Golden Flower.

Yun Yang Zi said: The sea within has no impurities; the Three Worms gradually depart.

Yuan Yang Zi said: The sea of water and grain holds its dregs. Refining lead and mercury for a hundred days; closing the breath to nourish *qi* for a thousand breaths—its dregs are eliminated. What are the Three Worms? The upper is *Péngjū* (彭倨), dwelling in the upper *Dāntián*; in thirty days, it perishes, and my complexion becomes radiant. The middle is *Péngzhì* (彭质), dwelling in the middle *Dāntián*; in sixty months, it perishes, and my hunger and thirst cease while my form becomes moist. The lower is *Péngjiāo* (彭娇), dwelling in the lower *Dāntián*; in ninety days, it perishes, and my desires cease while I return to youth.

How do the Three Corpses perish? I have heard: three hundred sixty breaths, swallowing *qi* twenty-four times per breath, ninety breaths before resting, and at midnight, reciting: "The East’s *Qīngyá* (青牙, Green Tooth) drinks the morning flower; the South’s *Chìyá* (赤牙, Red Tooth) drinks from the elixir pool; the Central gazes upward at *Tàishān* (泰山, Grand Mountain), ingesting primordial *qi* and drinking from the *Lìquán* (醴泉, Sweet Spring). The West consumes the clear and drinks the sacred fluid; the North’s *Xuánzǐ* (玄滋, Mysterious Nourishment) eats the jade ox." Each direction is swallowed three times, and the Three Worms thus perish, while white *qi* emerges from the brow like jade clouds.

Yun Yang Zi said: Its form arises from the Golden Skeleton, accompanying the Floating Inquiry.

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:

*"The refining of lead and mercury—*
when the sun and moon, the four seasons, and the Three Officials are turned in cycles of three hundred,
the **Golden Elixir** is complete in a hundred days.

*By closing the breath and nurturing the **qi**,*
until it reaches ten thousand,
the **Golden Skeleton** transforms.

*When the mind has a direction,*
and one ascends the **Floating Inquiry** upon flying clouds,
these are the **Five Assumptions** of immortality."

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"From one to ten,
one can distribute according to the cycles of years and months."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"From one to ten,
from ten to a hundred,
from a hundred to a thousand,
from a thousand to ten thousand,
from ten thousand to a hundred million,
from a hundred million to a trillion,
from a trillion to a quadrillion,
from a quadrillion to a quintillion*—this is the number.

*A day and a night constitute a hundred **kè** (刻, time-marks)—*
this is the distinction between the great and the small.

*Why so?*
*A day has twelve **shí** (时, hours),
six of which are **Yang**—*
from **Zǐ** (子, 11 PM) to **Wǔ** (午, 11 AM),
*and six of which are **Yin**—*
from **Wǔ** (午, 11 AM) to **Hài** (亥, 11 PM).
*Exhausting the night,*
a hundred **kè** with twenty-four **fēn** (分, minutes) and forty-four **xiāo** (杪, fractions),
seventy-two **biàn** (变, changes),
*—its pattern is that of one year.*
*Ten months—*
this is ten years,
*—the lesser of these.*
*A year has twelve months,*
six of which are **Yang**—
*from the eleventh month to the fourth month,*
*—and six of which are **Yin**—*
*from the fifth month to the tenth month.*
*—This is the greater of these.*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Day and hour, season and cycle—*
these are their numbers,
*—lying only in measuring the **Yin** and **Yang**."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"The day aligns with the hour.*
*For nurturing the nature and refining the life,*
one can use the four seasons and their four **Mèng** (孟, beginnings)—
**Lìchūn** (立春, Beginning of Spring), **Lìxià** (立夏, Beginning of Summer), **Lìqiū** (立秋, Beginning of Autumn), **Lìdōng** (立冬, Beginning of Winter).
*The hour can be used with **Yín** (寅, Tiger), **Shēn** (申, Monkey), **Wǔ** (午, Horse), and **Hài** (亥, Pig)—
*—these are the seven returns and nine reversions.*
**Yín** is wood;
**Shēn** is metal;
**Wǔ** is fire;
**Hài** is water,
*—these are the four **Xiàng** (象, phases).*
*When absorbed into the **Central Palace** (中宫),
*—this is the five **Xíng** (行, elements).*
**Yín** is metal;
**Wǔ** is water;
**Shēn** is wood;
**Hài** is fire.
*When absorbed into the **Central Palace** (中宫),
*—it reverses the **Kàn** (坎, Abyss) and **Lí** (离, Fire)—*
hence, it is called the seven returns.
*The **Clásico** says:*
*'**Lí** contains true water,
**Kàn** contains proper metal,'*
*—hence, it is called the nine reversions.*
*—This is the **Yin** and **Yang**."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **Six Harmonies** (六合) and the **Breaking of the Divine Mechanism** (冲破神机) mutually embrace and complete."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Zǐ** (子, 11 PM) and **Chǒu** (丑, Ox),
**Yín** (寅, Tiger) and **Hài** (亥, Pig),
**Wǔ** (午, Horse) and **Shēn** (申, Monkey),
**Wèi** (未, Sheep) and **Yǒu** (酉, Rooster),
**Xū** (戌, Dog) and **Mǎo** (卯, Hare),
**Chén** (辰, Dragon) and **Zǐ** (丑, Ox)—
*—these are the **Six Harmonies**.*

*And **Zǐ** (子, 11 PM) and **Wǔ** (午, Horse),
**Mǎo** (卯, Hare) and **Yǒu** (酉, Rooster),
**Wǔ** (午, Horse) and **Hài** (亥, Pig),
**Yín** (寅, Tiger) and **Shēn** (申, Monkey),
**Chén** (辰, Dragon) and **Xū** (戌, Dog),
**Chǒu** (丑, Ox) and **Wèi** (未, Sheep)—
*—these are the **Breaking** (冲).*
*By turning within the **Six Harmonies** and acting through their **Breaking**,
*—this is how the **Divine Mechanism** (天机) completes itself.*
*Follow this and there will be no error.*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"When the practice succeeds,*
*—the greater takes nine years,*
*—the lesser takes a hundred days."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"Nine years—*
*—its lesser practice,*
*—still requires twenty-seven years.*
*Closing the breath for a hundred days,*
*—then the **Golden Elixir** is complete,*
*—more effective than the nine-year difficulty."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Yín** (寅, Tiger) and **Shēn** (申, Monkey) align with **Wǔ** (午, Horse) and **Hài** (亥, Pig),
*—and **Zǐ** (子, 11 PM) and **Wǔ** (午, Horse) turn the **Golden Elixir**."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Yín** (寅, Tiger), **Shēn** (申, Monkey), **Wǔ** (午, Horse), and **Hài** (亥, Pig)—*
*—these are the four seasons,*
*—the functional cycles of the

Spring gives birth to all things—
this is **two yang and one yin**,
with yin beneath,
and in thirty days, it blooms into **Hua**.*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Lí** (離, Vermilion Bird) is the **Zhūquè**—
its essence is hidden in the earth."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Lí** arises from **Zhèn** (震),
nurtured by wind, its form is fire—
this is **cinnabar**,
within which lies **mercury**,
its correspondence to **Wǔ** (午, Horse),
rooted in the earth.
Why is it stored above?
**Kūn** (坤, Earth) lies in the southwest,
paired with **Qián** (乾, Heaven) as husband and wife—
in sixty days, **Zǐjīng** (紫精) is complete."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Duì** (兌, Lake) emerges from **Kūn**’s palace,
its essence self-sealed."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Duì** is the west,
the **Yǒu** (酉, Rooster) position,
born of **Kūn**.
Thus, the sun and moon face each other—
the moon waxes, the sun wanes—
this is **one yin and one yang**,
with yang beneath,
and in ninety days, **Zǐjīnshā** (紫金砂) is formed."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"After **Zǐ** (子, 11 PM), the cycle returns to its initial hexagram.
**Yín** (寅, Tiger) and **Shēn** (申, Monkey) unite in harmony—
this is the **seven returns**."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Fù** (復, Recovery) is the **five yin and one yang**—
the **Dragon in the Field**.
From **Zǐ** to **Shēn**,
this is **Pǐ** (否, Opposition)—
three yin, three yang—
thus, the **seven returns**."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Before **Wǔ** (午, Horse), the incoming aligns in response."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Sì** (巳, Snake) and **Hài** (亥, Pig)—
the **nine returns** of **Qián** and **Kūn** are complete.
**Wǔ** is the moment when **one yin first emerges**,
the time to act, aligned with the month.
Its hexagram is **Rǎn** (孚, Sincerity)—
**five yang and one yin**,
treading frost to form solid ice.
**Sì** is the **Qián** hexagram—
the full measure of six yang is achieved.
Yang is **eight liang of silver**,
yin is **eight liang of gold**;
when gold and silver unite,
their combined weight is **384 zhu**—
this is **one jīn**.
The **nine returns** are the **nine transformations**,
and the nine colors are complete."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Gèn** (艮, Mountain) invests **Kūn**—
its yang is nearly exhausted,
cycling through yin and yang,
the nine-month course."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Gèn** is the **northeast**—
**one yang and two yin**.
**Kūn** is the **southwest**—
**three yin**.
When **Gèn** invests **Kūn**,
the hexagram is **Bō** (剥, Shedding)—
the nine-month symbol.
**One yang and five yin** extend to the tenth month,
when yang is exhausted and **Kūn** manifests."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Duì** enters **Qián**—
its yin is nearly severed,
the hexagram divides at the seasons—
this is the **nine-three cycle**."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Duì** is the west;
**Qián** is the **northwest**—
both are **metal**.
When **Duì** enters **Qián**,
this is **Yāng** (央, Central)—
the three-month symbol.
**Five yang and one yin** extend to the fourth month,
when yin is severed and **Qián** is complete—
this is the **nine returns**.
Thus, the **Great Elixir** becomes the **Purple Gold Elixir**."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **upper arc** is the moon’s beginning,
born in the **Gēng** (庚) position."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"On the moon’s third day,
it rises in **Gēng**—
this is the initial **golden crystal qi**.
Thus, the yin line weighs **twelve zhu**,
named **Yuèpò** (月魄, Moon’s Shadow)."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **lower arc** is the moon’s decline,
found in the **Jiǎ** (甲) position."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"On the moon’s twenty-eighth day,
it rises in **Jiǎ**—
the **Great Sun** appears,
and this is the initial **wooden crystal qi**.
The yang line weighs **twelve zhu**,
named **Rìhún** (日魂, Sun’s Soul).
When sun and moon unite,
their combined weight is **one liang**.
The *Yì* says:
*'In the southwest, companions are gained—
the upper arc;
In the northeast, companions are lost—
the lower arc.'
Gaining companions is the sun setting while the moon rises;
Losing companions is the moon setting while the sun rises.
This is the yin-yang line’s measure.
Thus, **lead**, born of wood,
is **yang, silver, the exterior, the husband**;
**mercury**, born of metal,
is **yin, gold, the interior, the wife**—
their union completes the **four symbols**."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Seven and eight—
the sun and moon face each other;
Two and eight—
yin and yang are complete."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"The sun and moon—
on the fifteenth day, they face each other.
When they meet, they are newly born.
Fifteen days prior, there are two days;
the sun waxes, the moon wanes—
fifteen days later, there are eight days.
The moon waxes, the sun wanes—
this is **six yin and six yang**,
and the lines are complete.
Their yin-yang weights,
each **192 zhu**—
this is **one jīn**."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"The moon—
paired with the twenty-third day—
its birth hour is in **Lí** (離)."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"On the eighth and twenty-third days,
the moon rises, the sun sets—
both occur in the **south**.
The south is **Lí**;
**Lí** is fire within water.
The moon is the **metal qi**,
as the child of water.
Yin and yang paired—
**gold and silver**—
the **Great Elixir** meets and harmonizes."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Gold** is yin, the moon;
**silver** is yang, the sun.
When **mercury** obtains **lead**, the **Great Elixir** is formed—
this is the sun and moon’s union."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Preserve its spirit and breath,
and the elixir is complete."*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **spirit** is **qi, wood, breath, blood, water**.
**Breath** contains the five grains,
and is also **earth, metal, water, wood, fire**.
**Blood** is water,
and thus also **marrow, essence**.
**Essence** is **spirit**.
He who preserves his **essence-qi**,
thus unites the **jīn-yè qi**,
nourishes his **ming** (命, fate),
and extends his years."*

The **Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Nine transformations—
will the **Three Pure Ones’** celestial talisman arrive?"*

The **Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"Having recognized **lead and mercury**,
refining them into the elixir,
settling them in the **three palaces**,
using the hexagrams daily,
cycling through the six times,
with the **Heavenly Gate** unopened,
the **Earthly Door** unclosed—
thus, there is no leakage.
The celestial talisman should indeed arrive."*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Seven transformations—
these arise from the **One Qi**;
the **Divine Talisman** and **White Snow**—
these come from **Jiǎ-Gēng**.*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"Seven transformations—
these are seven returns;
**Qi**—
this is the **true qi** born from the **Dan Field**;
**Jiǎ-Gēng**—
this is the **metal and wood** in mutual assault;
the **Divine Talisman** and **White Snow**—
this is the union of **essence-qi** within the **crucible**.*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Apply the mind to **Yín-Shēn**,
diligently tend the **fire stages**,
preserve the **white and black**,
thus returning the **golden crystal**.*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"**Yín**—
this is **wood**, this is **lead**;
**Shēn**—
this is **metal**, this is **mercury**—
refined from **Yín** to **Hài**."*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Daily use—
this is the **four seasons**, this is the **eight trigrams**;
the **Great Elixir** can transform one into an infant.*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"Daily use—
this is one day as one year;
the **four seasons**—
these are **Yín-Shēn-Yǐ-Hài**;
the **eight trigrams**—
**Qián, Kūn, Lí, Kàn, Pǐ, Tài, Fù, Guān**.
Three hundred and twenty days—
the **Great Elixir** is complete;
one thousand three hundred days—
the **three worms** perish."*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"When the **three worms** perish, one is serene and without care,
and may then nurture the **golden essence**."*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"Then the **Five Grains** are cut off,
and the **golden essence** abides on its own."*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **Heavenly Pass** is sealed,
the **Earthly Gate** is firmly shut—
the **Mid-Court Infant** plays with the sun and moon."*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"When the **Heavenly Pass** is sealed, all flavors do not enter;
when the **Earthly Gate** is shut, there is no leakage below.
The **Mid-Court**—this is the **Cinnabar Field**.
Within it are **lead and mercury**,
whose name is the **Infant**,
playing with the **true qi of Yin and Yang**!"*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"Before the **Bright Hall** lies a **Jade Pool**."*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **Bright Hall**—this is the **Pure Key**, the **Essence Sea**, the **Chamber of Mystery**."*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **Yellow Mother** then marries the **Maiden**."*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"When **lead and mercury** meet **earth**, they return to **One**."*

**Yún Yáng Zi** said:
*"When the **binding** is complete, the **true embryo** is shed.
Projected across the **Twenty-Four Breaths**,
ten months mark its term—
then the **Infant** is born from the **crown of the head**."*

**Yuán Yáng Zi** said:
*"The **true qi** gradually congeals in the **Cinnabar Field**,
returning to the **color of a child**—
this is the **shedding of the embryo**.
In the months of **Mao and You**, one must not descend the **fire**,
but may bathe.
Thus, the **year’s work** is but **ten months**.
Preserve and visualize the **true qi**,
as it circulates from the **crown of the head** in and out—
this is the **Infant**."*

**The Chapter on "The Multitude of Marvels"**

The method of **Daoist cultivation (导养)**—to refine the **nature (性)** and preserve the **form (形)**—when practiced without neglect, leads one to **longevity (长生)**.

The **Yin True Master (阴真君)** names **longevity (长生)** as follows:
The **orthodox qi (正气)** of the Northern **Dao (方)** is the **River Vehicle (河车)**;
The **restraining of the first and second **Dao (方甲乙)** is the **Golden Sand (金砂)**.
When one **nourishes (含养)** these two, they merge into **one whole (一体)**.
The **Vermilion Bird (朱雀)**, harmonizing the **circulation (调运)**, then gives rise to the **Golden Flower (金花)**.
The **Flower (花)** is the **treasure of Heaven and Earth (天地之宝)**.
**Yǒu (酉)** is the **Tiger (虎)**; **Mǎo (卯)** is the **Dragon (龙)**.
When **Dragon (龙)** and **Tiger (虎)** generate each other, they achieve **unity (合同)**.
The **Dragon’s (龙)** proper position is the **Sixty-Fourth (六八)**;
The **Tiger’s (虎)** birthplace is the **First Palace (一宫)**.
To **harvest (采)** them requires a precise **time (日)**;
To **take (取)** them requires a proper **season (时)**.
If one misjudges the **climatic conditions (气候)**, the labor will be in vain.
To **seek the Cauldron (鼎)** in the **Central Palace (中宫)**,
To **warm-nourish (温养)** its **fiery phase (火候)**,
To **discern (审)** its **Yin and Yang (阴阳)**,
To **settle (安)** its **furnace-chamber (炉室)**,
One must **choose a secluded and secret place (地而隐密)**.
To **preserve (保)** without loss is the **mechanism of Heaven and Earth (天地之机)**.
**Yang (阳)** is the **True Sand (真砂)**;
**Yin (阴)** is the **True Mercury (真汞)**.
That which **generates substance from non-substance (无质生质)** is the **Returned Elixir (还丹)**.
When **refined (炼)** and **ingested (饵)**, one attains **transcendence (仙)**.
The **Yellow Sprout (黄芽)** is what **Heaven and Earth (天地)** produce;
The **Sand (砂)** is the **essence of water (水之精)** refined into existence.
When these two merge into **one whole (一体)**,
The **Western **Dao (方)** elevates its **Royal Qi (王气)**,
And its attainment of the **Way (道)** lies within the **Central Realm (中华)**.
If one does not grasp this, it is rare not to **lose one’s family (丧其家)**.

**Pure Yang Master (纯阳子)** Lü Dòngbīn (吕洞宾) says:
What is the **True One (真一)**?
It is the **Yang of Heaven (天之阳)** and the **Yin of Earth (地之阴)**,
The **qi of things (物之气)** and the **human nature (人之性)**,
The **ancestor of the body (身之祖)** and the **root of life (命之宗)**,
The **substance of the Dragon (龙之体)** and the **form of the Tiger (虎之形)**,
The **name of vital essence and blood (精血之名)**,
The **source of lead and mercury (铅汞之首)**.
When seen in the **spirit (魂)**, it is **Three (三)**;
When encountered in the **ethereal soul (魄)**, it is **Seven (七)**.
This is the **origin of the True One (真一之源)**.

What is the **method of cultivation (修之之法)**?
Within my **body (身)**, I refine the **qi of the Elixir Field (丹田之气)**,
Until it reaches its **peak (壮)**—then the **natural spirit (自然之神)** is complete.
At the **twelfth hour (十有二时)**,
I **guard the True One’s single qi (天真之一气)**,
Entering the **Palace of the Elixir Field (丹田之宫)**,
With **mind free of thought (心无想)**,
And **external senses unattached (外无意)**—
Neither **emerging nor retiring (不出不入)**,
Nor **departing nor arriving (不往不来)**,
Then the **spirit settles (神定)** and **finds ease (自安)**.

**Pure Yang Master (纯阳子)** says:
**Emissions (发)** should be **prolonged (长续)**;
The **hands (手)** should **always face (常面)**;
The **mouth (口)** should **always refine (常炼)**;
The **body (体)** should **always draw inward (常挽)**;
The **fluids (液)** should **always be swallowed (常咽)**;
The **qi (气)** should **always be refined (常炼)**;
The **vital essence (精)** should **always circulate (常转)**;
The **complexion (色)** should **always be distant from excess (常远)**;
**Meditation (定)** should **always transform (常变)**.

**Master Sun (孙真人)**, Sī Miào (思邈), says:
**Form (形)** desires **exertion (劳)**;
**Alcohol (酒)** should not be consumed to **excessive intoxication (大醉)**,
Then **illness (疾)** will not arise.
**Overindulgence in food (饱食)** is **unbeneficial (无益)**.
After eating, **walk a hundred steps (行之百步)**,
Then **rub the abdomen with the hands (以手摩其腹)**.
On days of **Yín-Chǒu (寅丑)**,
**Trim the nails and comb the hair (剪甲栉发)** a hundred times—
If done after **fullness (饱)**, it leads to **sudden death (立没)**;
If done in **hunger (饥)**, it leads to **sitting death (坐没)**.
**Walking should avoid facing the wind (勿迎风)**;
**Residence should have no gaps (勿有隙)**;
At night, **fear the soles of the feet (惧足)** while sleeping.
**Overthinking (思虑)** harms the **spirit (神)**;
**Excessive joy or anger (喜怒)** harms the **qi (气)**.
**Nose hairs should be removed (去毛)**;
**Spittle should not be cast upon the earth (勿唾地)**.
At dawn, **descend from the bed (下榻)**,
First placing the **left foot (左足)**,
Then **evil is repelled (去邪辟恶)**,
And **one suffers no misfortune (无殃)** that day.
To **walk the Seven-Star Step (七星之步)**,
Then **longevity and joy (寿且乐)** shall be attained.
**Sour (酸)** harms the **sinews (筋)**;
**Bitter (苦)** harms the **bones (骨)**;
**Sweet (甘)** harms the **flesh (肉)**;
**Pungent (辛)** harms the **qi (气)**;
**Salty (咸)** diminishes **longevity (寿)**.
Thus, those **indulging in cravings (耽嗜)** should **avoid extremes (不可偏)**.
In **spring and summer (春夏)**, one should **moderately release (少施泄)**;
In **autumn and winter (秋冬)**, one should **consolidate the Yang (固阳)**.
**Solitary sleep (独寝)** while **guarding the True (守真)**,
Combined with **strict stillness (谨静)**,
Is also **worthy of esteem (可贵)**.

**Wealth and goods (财货)** are **allotted at birth (生而有定分)**;
To **know contentment (知足)** is to **gain their benefit (为利)**.
To **forcefully seek (强之)** is a **great calamity (大患)**;
To **have few desires (寡欲)** is to **avoid burdens (无累)**;
To **have a tranquil spirit (神静)** is to **remain ever at ease (常安)**;
Thus, those who **cultivate the Dao (修道)** should **have a clear beginning and end (有终始)** before success can be achieved.

**Master Qī Zhēn (栖真子)**, Shī Jiānwú (施肩吾), says:
I have seen **thousands of those studying the Dao (学道者)**,
Yet who **understands its essential principle (道之要)**?
It lies in **spirit abiding within the form (神留形住)**—
If the **form is preserved (形住)**, then the **spirit abides (神留)**.
If the **spirit departs externally (神苟外进)**, how can the **form be safeguarded (其形岂能保哉)**?
Yet to **preserve the qi and nourish the spirit (保气养神)**,
One cannot **achieve it through mere stagnation (湛然而得之)**,
Nor **guard it through sheer rigidity (兀然而守之)**.
To **preserve the qi (保气)** lies in **hand movements (手运)**;
To **nourish the spirit (养神)** lies in **proper application (用)**.
I have heard from my **teacher (师)**:
When the **body is empty (体虚)** yet the **qi is firm (气固)**,
And the **form is still (形静)** while the **spirit converges (神会)**,
This is the **mystery of transcending the world (出世之玄机)**!

**Kūn Tái True Master (昆台真人)**, transmitted by **Fù Wénzhōng (富文忠公)**, as **Kūn Tái True Master (昆台真人)** spoke to **Lè Quán (乐全)**, **Master Zhāng Wéndìng (张文定公)**, who recorded it himself, saying:
I **sought the method of nurturing life (求颐生之道)** and obtained one **simple and easy (简易)**.
From the **third watch (子)** until **three or four points (三更三四点)**,
And from the **fifth watch (五更)** onward,
I can **don my clothes (披衣)**, **curl my feet (蟠足)**, and **sit (坐)**—
Even **clasping a quilt (拥袁)** on the bed is acceptable.
Whether **facing south (束向)** or **west (西向)**,
I **tap my teeth (扣其齿)** thirty-six times,
**Clenching them firmly (握固)** to **harmonize my original qi (调其元气)**.

「Now, why **clench firmly (握固)**? I use the **left and right thumbs (左右拇)** to pinch the **three fingers (三指)** on the other hand, or with the **four fingers (四指)** to firmly grasp the **thumb (拇)**—employing the **left and right hands (左右手)** to **prop my waist and abdomen (柱乎腰腹之问)**. Thus, when the **original qi (元气)** is **harmonized (调)**, my **breath (息)** becomes **subtle and faint (微微)**, my **abdomen (腹)** feels **as if hollow (若虚)**, then I **close my breath (闭息)**.

Why **close my breath (闭息)**? I first **shut my eyes (瞑目)** and **quiet my thoughts (静虑)**, making my **heart-source (心源)** **profoundly still (湛然)**, then I **close my mouth and nostrils (闭其口鼻)**, lest the **qi (气)** escape. Internally, I **contemplate (观)** the **Five Zàng-organs (五藏)** and **Six Fǔ-organs (六府)**, the **Three Elements (三元)** and **Nine Palaces (九宫)**, and the **colors of the Zàng-organs (藏)**: the **lungs’ white (肺之白)**, the **liver’s green (肝之青)**, the **spleen’s yellow (脾之黄)**, the **heart’s red (心之赤)**, and the **kidneys’ black (肾之黑)**.

But how do I **know (知)** this? I **drew diagrams (为图)** of the **Five Zàng-organs (五藏)** and **observed them daily (日观)**, thus **knowing them in detail (详矣)**. Then I **imagine (想)** my **heart (心)** as a **flaming fire (炎火)**, its **light (光)** **piercing (洞彻)** down to **below my navel (脐之下)**—this is my **Elixir Field (丹田)**.

When my **abdomen (腹)** is **full (满)**, and my **qi (气)** is **at its peak (极)**, I **gradually exhale (徐出)** it, ensuring it **does not make a sound (勿使耳有闻)**. Once the **breath’s exhalation (息之出)** is **harmonized (调)**, I **stir my tongue (搅)** between the **inner and outer lips (唇)** and **teeth (齿)**, **rinsing and refining (漱炼)** its **saliva (津液)**.

If there is **nasal mucus (涕)**, I also **rinse and refine (漱炼)** it—this is the **True Qi (真气)**, which, with **prolonged practice (久)**, becomes **sweet (甘)**. While **rinsing and refining (漱炼)**, I **must not swallow (咽)** yet. Then, as before, I **close my breath (闭息)**, internally **contemplate (观)**, **draw my heart’s fire (纳心之火)** into the **Elixir Field (丹田)**, and **harmonize my breath (调息)** while **rinsing the saliva (漱津)**.

Doing this **three times (三)**, the **saliva (津)** is **full (满)**. I **bow my head (俯首)** and **swallow (咽)**, **sending the qi (以气送之)** to the **Elixir Field (丹田)**. My **intent (用意)** must be **precise and powerful (精猛)**, so that the **saliva (津)** and **qi (气)** **roll audibly (谷谷有声)** into the **Elixir Field (丹田)**. Then I **repeat (复)** as before.

In total, **closing the breath (闭息)** **nine times (九)**, and **swallowing the saliva (咽津)** **three times (三)**, before **ceasing (止)**. Then I **use both hands (左右手)** to **warmly massage (熟摩)** my **face (面)** and **four limbs (四体)**. Next, I **massage (摩)** the **soles of my feet (足心)**, **flexing and folding (屈折)** them, so that the **Wellspring Spring (涌泉)** **acupuncture point (穴)** **ascends (上彻)** to the **Crown (顶门)**. Then I **gradually massage (徐摩)** below the **navel (脐)**, the **waist (腰)**, and the **spine (脊)**.

It is **good (可)** if **sweat (汗)** **emerges (出)**, but **panting (喘)** is **not allowed (不可)**. Next, I **use both hands (左右手)** to **press and warm (熨)** my **eyes (目)**, **face (面)**, **ears (耳)**, and **crown (顶)**, all **extremely hot (极热)**. Then I **press and knead (按捏)** the **left and right sides of my nasal bridge (鼻梁左右)**, either **five (五)** or **seven (七)** times, and **comb (栉)** my **hair (发)** **up to a hundred (至於百)** strokes. I **loosen my hair (散发)** and **sleep (寝)** until **morning (旦)**. With **prolonged practice (久)**, there will be **benefits (功)**. After **twenty days (二十日)**, the **effects (效)** will **appear (见)**.

Only **practicing breath-closure (闭息)** **steadily (持久)** is **difficult (难)**. I **use pulse-watching (脉候)** to **mark five arrivals (五至)**—one **breath (息)**. I can **close my breath (闭其息)**, up to **a hundred and twenty (百有二十)** times. When I **open (开)** it, it **reaches (盖)** **two thousand (二士干)** breaths.

Yet, one **must not forcefully close (强闭)** the **breath (息)** to **disturb (乱)** the **qi (气)**, or let it **burst forth (奔突)**—this is **harmful (害)**. In the **evening (暮)**, one **must not overeat (多食)**, lest the **abdomen (腹)** be **too full (宽)** and **hollow (虚)**, allowing the **qi (气)** to **circulate freely (回转)**.

During the **day (昼)**, I **also frequently shut my eyes (数瞑目)** to **internally contemplate (内观)**, **rinse and refine (漱炼)** the **saliva (津液)**, and **swallow (咽)** it. I **press and warm (熨摩)** my **ears (耳)** and **face (面)**, to **aid (助)** the **True Qi (真气)** in **clearing and quieting (清静)**—thus the **practice (功)** will **easily succeed (易成)**.

However, there are **three harms (三害)** to the **Dao (道)** in the world: **anger and agitation (忿躁)**, **cunning and deceit (阴险)**, and **greed and desire (#1贪欲)**. Those **pursuing the Dao (学道者)** must **guard against (戒)** them.

**Master Sū Zǐxán (苏子瞻)** of **Chóuchí Pond (仇池)** said: **"When hungry, eat; when not yet full, stop (已饥而食，未饱而止)**. **Take leisurely walks (散步逍遥)**, keeping my **abdomen (腹)** **hollow (虚)**. When it is **hollow (虚)**, I **enter into meditation (入於定)**, with **no limit to day or night (无昼夜之限)**. Whether **lying down (寝)** or **sitting (坐)**, I can **do this (为之)**.

Only in **restraining (摄)** my **body (身)**, like a **wooden puppet (木偶)**, does it **stand still (兀然)**. I **focus on the white tip of my nose (视鼻端之白)**, **counting (数)** the **breath’s entry and exit (息之出入)**—**softly and continuously (绵绵若存)**. I **use this method (用之)** **sparingly (不勤)**, up to **hundreds of times (至於数百)**. Then my **heart (心)** becomes **tranquil (寂然)**, my **body (身)** **still (兀然)**, **unified with the Great Emptiness (太虚)**. Thus, I **do not move (不动)** even without **restraint (禁制)**.

The **count of breaths (息之数)** may **reach a point where they cannot be counted (至於不能计)**. I then **exhale and inhale (出入)** with my **breath (息)**, **following (随)** it **without end (不已)**. Then the **breath (息)** **naturally ceases (自住)**, neither **exhaling (出)** nor **inhaling (入)**.

Thus, my **breath (息)** may **emerge (从)** from **the pores of my body (毛窍之中)**—**eighty-four thousand (八万四千)** times, like **steam and mist (云蒸雾散)**, and all **ailments (诸疾)** will **be removed (除)**.

Therefore, those **nurturing life (养生者)** must **take prenatal breathing (胎息)** as their **foundation (本)**. Yet, it is **arduous (艰)** indeed! If one **does not close (闭)** the **qi (气)**, but **lets it enter and exit (任其出入)**, it will be **faint and scattered (眇绵)**, and **near boiling (况沸)**—there is **no remarkable effect (近无卓然之功)**. Or one may **hope (望)** for it to **naturally cease (兀然自止)**, but this **will not happen (盖未之有)**.

If one **closes (闭)** and **retains (留)** the **breath (息)**, but it **does not exceed (不过)** **thirty (三十)** or **fifty (五十)**, it will **burst forth (奔突)**. Even if **a slight warmth (微肠)** **emerges (生)** in the **Lower Elixir Field (下丹田)**, it is **like a field irrigated by a boiling pot (稼於汤世)**—it **will wither after one watering (终一溉而后枯)**, not the **method of transcending the world (度世之道)**.

I once **heard (闻)** from **Sūn Sīmiǎo (孙思邈)** that: **"To harmonize the spirit and qi (和神气)**, one must **enter a secluded chamber (密室)**, **shutting the door (肩户)**. The **bed (榻)** must be **settled (安)** and the **mattress (茵)** **thick (厚)**. The **pillow (枕)** should be **two and five-tenths inches high (高二寸有五分)**. Then, **straightening my body (正身)** and **lying down (偃外)**, I **plunge my heart into stillness (冥心)**, **closing the qi (闭气)** between my **chest and diaphragm (胸膈之问)**. I **place a goose feather (鸿毛)** at the **tip of my nose (鼻之端)** and **keep it still (不动)**. After **three hundred breaths (三百息)**, my **eyes (目)** see **nothing (无见)**, my **heart (心)** thinks **nothing (无思)**.

Thus, **cold and heat (寒暑)** cannot **invade (侵)**, and **wasps and bees (蜂趸)** cannot **poison (毒)** me. My **lifespan (寿)** will be **three hundred and sixty years (三百有六十岁)**, **approaching that of a True Person (真人)**.

I **pondered (默而深思)** his **intent (旨)** and said: **"Closing the qi (闭气)** between the **chest and diaphragm (胸膈)**, so that the **breath’s entry and exit (息之出入)** **move yet remain still (动而不动)**, **steaming and wispy (氤氲缥缈)**, like **smoke from a black furnace (若黑炉之烟)** or **vapor from a boiling cauldron (烹鼎之气)**—**breathing naturally (出入自如)**, without **forced inhalation or exhalation (无呼吸之者)**—this is why the **goose feather (鸿毛)** can **remain unmoving (不动)**.

Thus, my **heart (心)** does not **arise in thought (起於念)**, even if **three hundred breaths (过乎三百息)** have **passed (息)**—this is **also acceptable (斯亦可)**. I once **lay down (卧)** and **practiced (为之)** as he **said (方)**. I **focused my intent (以意守)** on the **qi (气)** within my **chest and diaphragm (胸膈之中)**.

When I **wished to inhale (欲吸)**, I **slightly inhaled (微吸)**. When I **wished to exhale (欲呼)**, I **could not exhale (不得呼)**—instead, I **let the qi (气)** **steam and wisp (氤氲缥缈)**, **faintly emerge (微微自出)** on its own. When it **exhausts itself (出尽)**, the **qi (气)** **becomes even (平)**, and I **slightly inhale (微吸)** again.»

Thus, its **outflow and inflow** are **unbroken**, yet the **goose feather** can **remain unmoving**—if it moves, it moves **slightly**. I **awaited** its movement, then **redoubled my intent** to **restrain it**, compelling it to **stand still** before ceasing.

Though I **restrained** it, I did not **seal** it. When the **breaths** reached **hundreds**, the **outflow grew scant**, the **non-outflow abundant**, and **internal cultivation flourished**. The **blood vessels** flowed **throughout**, **pouring between upper and lower**—thus, the **principles of nurturing life** were **realized**.

Commodore Yu said: *"In ancient times, Zeng Zi Chan spoke: ‘Fire is fierce, and men fear it; water drowns, yet men trifle with it.’"* Wing Delivered this, saying the **northern temperament** favors **Acquisition Wolf** (贪狼), while the **southern temperament** abhors **Modesty and Rectitude** (廉正). **Modesty and Rectitude** belong to the **Noble**; **Acquisition Wolf** to the **Petty**. From this, I **gained insight**.

Fire is the **heart**; water is the **kidneys**. **Fierce**, it **begets rectitude**; **weak**, it **begets depravity**. Thus, even the **wise kidneys** cannot avoid **depravity** if the **heart is rectified** while the **kidneys are depraved**. Yet if **not excessive**, the **kidneys obey the heart’s command**. Even the **lowest heart** may be **rectified**, but if **constantly depraved**, the **heart cannot govern**. Knowing this **penetrates the principles of Lead and Mercury, Dragon and Tiger**.

**Lead** refers to **qi**. It **rushes or stumbles**, **inhales or exhales**, **grasps or strikes**—all **movement** is **Lead**. The **lungs govern inhalation and exhalation**, so the **lungs are Metal, the White Tiger**.

**Mercury** refers to **water**. **Saliva, tears, pus, blood, semen, sweat, and urine**—all **moisture** is **Mercury**. The **liver governs storage**, so the **liver is the Azure Dragon**. The **ancient True Persons** who spoke of **internal elixir** all called it the **"Five Phases Reversal Art"**—the **Dragon emerges from fire**, the **Five Phases move counter**, the **Tiger arises from water**—yet none in the world **know this**.

When the **Five Phases proceed in order**, the **Dragon emerges from water**, the **Tiger from fire**—this is the **path of death**. If the **heart does not govern**, **external allurements** of **sound and color** **seduce**, while **internal depravity** **erupts**. The **essence of Ren and Gui** flows downward, becoming **human**—sometimes **rotten and decayed**—this is the **Mercury Dragon emerging from water**.

**Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight** all arise from the **heart**. **Joy** seizes and **drags**; **anger** beats and **strikes**; **grief** causes **leaping**; **delight** prompts **dancing**. **Internal movement** **responds externally**—this is the **Lead Tiger emerging from fire**. Both **emerge and cannot return**, hence it is called the **path of death**.

The **True Person** thus **teaches reversal**. What **path** is this? Confucius said: *"Think without **depravity**."* Without **thought**, one is **wood and stone**; yet there must be **thought without thought**. **Thought without thought** is **upright, solemn, and restrained**, not **licentious**—this is **discipline**. **Discipline begets calm**; **calm begets stillness** of **inhalation and exhalation**; **stillness of inhalation and exhalation** **extinguishes the heart’s fire** from **flaring upward**.

Fire in the *Yijing* is **Li**—**adherence**. It **must adhere**; it **never stands alone**. Water is its **consort**. If the **fire does not flare upward**, it **follows its consort**. When **water and fire unite**, the **essence of Ren and Gui** flows upward, entering the **brain**, overflowing at the **Mingmen**. If the **nasal fluid is not salty**, it is not **kidney essence**. This is the **Mercury Dragon emerging from fire**. The **elixir of longevity**, the **seed of internal elixir**, **cannot surpass this**.

At the **beginning of yin and yang**, **Heaven-One is water**, so **human formation begins as water**. The **Five Phases**—**one day water**, warmed by **qi** before **life**; thus **two days fire**, with **qi** before **bones**; thus **three days wood**, bones **hardening** before **rigid strength**; thus **four days metal**, bones **firming** before **flesh**; thus **five days earth**, flesh **forming**. While in the **mother’s womb**, the **mother inhales, and the child inhales**; the **mother exhales, and the child exhales**. The **mouth and nose close**, yet **communication is through the navel**—thus the **navel is the root of life**.

The **Mercury Dragon**, emerging from **fire**, flowing to the **brain**, overflowing at the **Mingmen**, **must return to the root**. The **heart’s fire**, not flaring upward but **following its consort**, is **fire ever at the root**. Thus the **essence of Ren and Gui**, **strengthened by fire**, **reaches the limbs**, overflows the **skin**, and **daily grows robust**, ultimately becoming **the body of steel**—this is the **Lead Tiger emerging from water**.

When **Dragon and Tiger are born**, the **internal elixir is complete**—**longevity and immortality** are achieved, yet **the Dao remains unattained**.

Hongmengzi Gao Xiang once **arrived at the Guanghan Palace**, where the **Jade Sovereign** commanded him to **see the Western Hua Lady**. The **Lady** imparted the **essentials of the Way**:

*"The **True One** lies within the **knocking at the Wu-Ji Gate**—within are **golden seeds**, the **root of yellow sprouts**, the **mother of all things**. The **mother**, meeting her **father**, becomes the **cauldron**. Thus, **sun and moon, soul and spirit** **interact**, one **ascending, one descending**, their **pearls flying** until they **reach Kunlun’s peak**, where they **must seek the Wandering Symbols**. Once obtained, **return to the Vermilion Palace** to **store them**. The **skin turns red**; the **hair turns black**—in **ninety days**, the **elixir is complete**."

In ancient times, **Wei Boyang** composed the *Cansong Contract*—**"the king of all alchemical scriptures for ten thousand ages."** Its opening lines: *"Heaven and Earth"* are the **gateway of the *Yijing***. **Heaven’s Way is male**; **Earth’s Way is female**—yet the world **does not know True Yin-Yang**, blindly **seeking Dragon and Tiger**.

The **sun is Li**; the **moon is Kan**. The **sun and moon**, **yin and yang**, **devour each other**. The **Golden Crow dies**; the **Jade Rabbit is born**—thus all **things are born** from the **circulation of Heaven and Earth**.

「The Dao of Heaven and Earth **resonates** in harmony, and male and female **unite**. The Four Symbols and Five Phases **converge** and **gather** here.

Day and night **are the *Zhun* and *Meng***—they **emanate** from Nature itself, not from **toiling** to observe the **auspices of fire**.

Some say: *"Below the navel* is the **domain of the Supreme One (太一)**. First, **envision the divine furnace within** it, then **preserve the true fire** blazing there. At the hour of *Zi*, **gather the vitality of the sun and moon** and cast them into the **crucible**, with **my own fluids** rinsing down into the **elixir field (丹田)**—this is the **divine water**. In ten months, **the embryo is cast off**, and a **baby is born**.

**Master Zhengyi (正一先生) Sima Ziming (司马子微)**’s *"Song of Forgetting Sitting"* says:
**Always remain silent** to **preserve the primordial *qi*** without harm,
**Minimize thought** so **wisdom illuminates the inner light**,
**Do not rage**—then **all spirits are serene and at ease**,
**Do not be reckless**—then **the mind is pure and clear**,
**Do not seek**—then **there is no flattery or deception**,
**Do not cling**—then **all is both round and square**,
**Do not covet**—then **true wealth and honor abound**,
**Do not act hastily**—then **what fear of princes and kings?**
**Taste ceases**, and **the spirit of the divine spring descends**,
**Resolve is steadfast**, and **true breath naturally lengthens**.
**Qi leaks**, and **the form returns to thick Earth**,
**Thoughts dissipate**, and **the spirit drifts to the realm of ghosts**.
**The heart dies**—then **the spirit may truly live**,
**The *pò* (魄) is extinguished**—then **the *hún* (魂) flourishes**.
**The utmost essence penetrates the form**, **vague and elusive**,
**The Great Dao aligns with the **mixed and boundless**,
**Transforming things is difficult**—yet **mystical applications endure**,
**Responding to changes does not stray** from **True Constant (真常)**.
**Creation and transformation**, if they **know the measure and compass**,
**Ghosts and gods cannot fathom** their **actions and concealments**.
**Moderate drinking, eating, and sleep**—this is the **True Person’s Forgetting Sitting**.

**Master Gao Xiangxian (高子名象先)** says: *"Close your eyes, curl your feet*, and with the **left hand embrace below the navel**, the **right hand rest upon the kidneys’ sides**. Then **envision the elixir field**, making it **blaze like fire**—this is the **Jade Maiden Embracing the Navel**.

**The Wandering Recluse (游子)** says: *"Embracing the Primordial and Preserving the One* is the **supreme essential** for nurturing life. Its names are nine:
1. **One-character *qi***,
2. **The Yellow River in Reverse Flow**,
3. **Flying Golden Crystal from the Elbow’s Back**,
4. **The River Chariot’s Rotation**,
5. **Returning to the Root and Restoring the Primordial**,
6. **Recycling the Light and Mixing the Essence**,
7. **The Five *Qi* Converging at the Primordial**,
8. **One Strike at Three Passes**,
9. **Three Fields in Reciprocal Motion**.

**The Wandering Recluse** further says: *"I possess the **orthodox method of prolonging life**, yet the world does not know it. **Above, I draw it into the *qi***; **below, I do not let it escape into the essence**. Thus, **I circulate it** with the **flow of the Jade Pool**, and **over time, it becomes the elixir**. This is my **life and vitality**—no other secret. **It is spirit, breath, and *qi***—a single substance with three forms. **The heart abides in the subtle**; the **mind in the profound**. The **navel’s *qi* surges** with its **movement**, nurturing the **elixir field**.

**The Embryonic Breath (谷神)** does not die*—this is **baby-breathing (胎息)**.

**Master Chongxu (冲虚子)** says: *"Only when the heart dies* can one **embrace the One**, **contain the *qi**, refine the essence**, and **assist the spirit**, preserving the **form**. Thus, **killing the Yin** generates the **Yang**—then the **spirit is born**, and the **Dao is complete**."

**Master Gao Xiangxian** says: *"At the peak of Kunlun (昆仑) lies the **Mysterious Pearl (玄珠)**. Only those who **seek the Wandering Symbols** can find it. **Return to the Vermilion Palace** to **store it**, and then **the skin becomes lustrous red**, the **hair twice as black**, while the **Northern Pole erases the register of death**."

**Du Ge (杜革)** says: *"There are **methods for refining gold elixir** and **secrets for reversing the flow to replenish the brain**. I have practiced **sitting upright in meditation**, awaiting **the *qi* to settle**. Then, **I spit out my turbid breath** thirty-five times, **seal the earthly orifices**, and **prevent any leakage**. Afterward, **I inhale the pure breath**, retaining it for **nine counts**, exhaling for **six**. This **timing** is **repeated**—then **it is perfect**.

When **the fluids are generated**, the **Red Dragon plows at the sides**—this occurs at **sixteen counts**. By the time **the mouth is full** and **I hollow my throat** to **stretch the *qi*** nine times, **I send the *qi* to the elixir field**. Then, **I slowly draw it out**. With **patience, results will come**.

I have also **sat upright in meditation**, awaiting **the *qi* to settle**, and **beaten the heavens** thirty-six times, **twisting the spine like a donkey’s** fourteen times. Then, **I kneel and bow my head to the earth**, using my **hands to rub the kidney chambers** thirty, fifty, or up to **a hundred times**—**gradually increasing**. **I exhale through the nose**, and **thus the sides rub each other**. When **it grows hot**, I **warm the external kidneys**. If the **count reaches a hundred**, and **the nasal *qi* is full**, I **slowly release it**.

**This practice occurs** in the **early hours of *Yin* after *Zi***—this is the **secret of reversing the flow to preserve the essence**.

**Emperor Huizong (徽宗)**, during the **early years of the Xuanhe reign (宣和初)**, when he was **Grand Minister of the Treasury (太府卿)**, once **asked Li Fu (李傅)** about **internal elixir methods**. Li Fu replied: *"The essence of internal elixir lies in **preserving the heart** and **nurturing the *qi***. **Repelling evil influences** is how **one preserves the heart**; **inner observation** is how **one nurtures the *qi***. **Preserve the heart and nurture the *qi***, then **the true fire will daily blaze**, and **the divine water of the Jade Pool will daily flourish**, allowing **one to flow above and below with Heaven and Earth**.

**The Dao of Heaven** is **circulation without accumulation**. The **sage follows this pattern**, and **simplicity reveals the harmony of Heaven and Earth**—thus **the principle is attained**.

**What sustains humanity’s life** is **the *qi***. When **the *qi* settles**, the **spirit settles**; when **the spirit settles**, the **form settles**. If **one can truly grasp this**, then **long life and enduring vision** begin **from here**!

Observe **the ebb and flow of cold and heat**, the **rotation of sun and moon**—this is how **Heaven and Earth endure**. **Blow and exhale**, **call and inhale**, **expel the old and take in the new**—this is how **the True Person endures in the world**.

**Master Dan Yuanzi (丹元子)** says: *"The form abides when the spirit settles; the spirit abides when the *qi* gathers. **The *qi* is the body’s fullness**; **the form is the spirit’s dwelling**. Thus, **when the *qi* is solid**, it **flourishes**; when **it is void**, it **wanes**; **when it settles**, it **generates life**; when **it is dissipated**, it **perishes**. **The *qi*** is what **Master Guangcheng (广成子)** **preserves** and what **Master Yanluo (烟萝子)** **refines**. Therefore, **in one word, it is all-encompassing**: the **mystery of preservation and refinement** lies in **this inhalation and exhalation alone.**"」

「Thus, the saying goes: **One gulp, two gulps**—the **mystic vapors** rise like clouds and rain reaches down—**three gulps, five gulps**, the **inner landscape** is filled and nourished. **Ten gulps, nine gulps**, the **heart’s fire descends**, the **kidney’s water ascends**; when **water and fire are harmonized**, then **the inner elixir is complete**. It can **ward off illness**, **preserve life**, **extend years**, and **transcend mortality**. Here lies the **key principle** of **advancing fire and guiding water**—the **pivotal method** of this Dao.

**At the hour of Zǐ (子) and before Wǔ (午)**, this is the **time for advancing fire**. **At the beginning of the fifth night**, when **yang vitality is at its peak**, it is **especially suitable for advancing fire**. **Sitting on the bed**, either **facing south** or **facing north**, **clasping the perineum** and **curling the feet**, **closing the eyes** and **straightening the spine** while seated, **calm the heart** and **quiet the thoughts**, then **internally observe the five viscera**. **Lifting the head** and **closing the mouth**, **draw in the pure *qi* through the nose** until it reaches its utmost limit—then **straighten the spine** and **swallow it**. **One swallow** is followed by **contracting the throat passage**; **one contraction**, then **another inhalation**; **two contractions**, then **another swallow and contraction**. If the *qi* reaches its peak and **cannot be stopped**, then **lower the head** and **open the mouth** to **exhale it**, ensuring no sound escapes the ears. This process, repeated **three times**, constitutes **one session**.

After the *qi* has **settled**, proceed to **guide water**. **Collect the nasal mucus** and **saliva from the mouth**, combining them into one; the more, the better. When **the rinsing reaches a hundred times**, the **saliva becomes warm and sweet**, then **lift the head** and **expand the chest**, gazing **leftward, rightward, and straight ahead**, performing **one swallow each**—**three swallows total**—and **imagine the *qi* descending to the elixir field**. **In all swallowing**, also **contract the throat passage**. This process, once, is **one session**. **The work of water and fire is thus completed**.

This Dao **outstrips Heaven and Earth’s natural transformations**; when first practiced, **the region below the navel feels as if burned by fire**, and **appetite increases**, **the limbs grow strong**. **With prolonged practice**, **white hair turns black**, **fallen teeth regrow**, and **spirit is fully restored**. **Returning to the state of an infant**, **cold and heat cannot harm**, **and spirits and demons cannot intrude**.

**Master Wèizōng (微宗)** said: *"Good."*

**The monk from Guìjī (会稽), a thousand-year-old sage**, said: *"I possess the **Seven Qi Methods**:*
**First, the *Qi* of *Kòu* (叩).** *Kòu* means **striking the teeth seven times**, to **gather the spirit**; within the mind, **visualize**—for each strike of the teeth, **contemplate one star**. The stars are **Kuí (魁)**, **Kuí (魁)**, **Wú (魑)**, **Mèi (魅)**, **Wú (魑)**, **Lián (魉)**, and **Yuán (鳄)**.

**Second, the *Qi* of *Tuō* (托).** *Tuō* means **lifting each hand**, as though **supporting a hundred pounds**, alternating **up and down eighteen times** per hand.

**Third, the *Qi* of *Zhāng* (张).** *Zhāng* means **first drawing the left hand**, as though **pulling a bowstring**; after pulling the bowstring, **then use the feet to draw a crossbow**; the right hand and feet follow the same, each **eighteen times**.

**Fourth, the *Qi* of *Mó* (摩).** *Mó* means **rubbing the left and right hands**, then **warming them** to **rub the ears**, called **awakening water**; next, **rub the eyes**, **thirty-six times each**, called **awakening fire**; then **rub the face** and **proceed to the torso**.

**Fifth, the *Qi* of *Yáo* (摇).** *Yáo* means **placing the left and right hands on the waist**, **crossing the feet** while seated, **shaking the left shoulder and scapula**, then **the right**, each **eighteen times**.

**Sixth, the *Qi* of *Kāi* (揩).** *Kāi* means **rubbing the left and right hands together**, then **warming them** to **rub the kidney chambers**, generating heat.

**Seventh, the *Qi* of *Shù* (漱).** *Shù* means **rinsing until saliva fills the mouth**, then **swallowing three times**; afterward, **rub the hands together**, **warming them** to **massage the elixir field** without limit.

**Xiàngshān Zǐ (象山子)** said: *"Those who **refine the primordial *qi*** can **unblock the nine orifices and hundred joints**, allowing it to **circulate freely**. **With prolonged practice**, **results will manifest**. **All who wish to refine *qi*** must first **calm the heart**, then **guide and draw** left and right **smoothly**, ensuring **all joints harmonize**. Then **clasp the perineum**, **close the mouth** and **inflating the cheeks**, **open the teeth** and **strain the abdomen**, swallowing **straight and unobstructed**. **Nine swallows** make **one cycle**; **four cycles of nine—thirty-six swallows**—comprise the **middle cycle**; **achieving three hundred sixty swallows** is the **great cycle**.

**Those who refine *qi* do not rely on fixed times**; only **the nasal *qi*** is allowed to **enter and exit freely**, while **the mouth swallows it**. If the body feels **cool**, then **warm *qi* must be drawn**; if the body feels **hot**, then **cool *qi* must be drawn**. **This primordial *qi*:** **swallowing three to fifty times daily**, up to **a hundred**, can **assist yang vitality** in **digesting food**, **preserving youthful complexion**, **nurturing hair and beard**, and **strengthening the body**.

If **the head feels dizzy and hot**, then **clasp the palms over the mouth** and **forcefully exhale**, **fifty times**—this will **cure the ailment**; if not yet cured, **repeat the process**.

**Those who refine this *qi* should take **Rehmannia wine** to **guide the inhalation**; when ready to practice, **wait until food is digested**, then **swallow the *qi***.

**Zhōu Zǐ (游子)** said: *"I have heard that **ancient perfected beings** possessed **methods to refine the body and transcend the world**. Their essence is as follows: **At the hour of Zǐ (子)**, when **one yang begins to emerge**, **loosen the clothes** and **clasp the perineum**, **strike the teeth thirty-six times**, **retract the eyes** and **reverse the ears**, **internally recall the location of the five viscera**, **lower the tongue** and **relax the throat**, **twisting it three times**. **Following the sun’s movement**, **twist three times**; **relaxing the throat**, **twist three times**—**naturally, the saliva arises in the **Crown Pool** (華池, *Huápóu*), **rinsing until the mouth is full**, then **swallowing three times**, passing through the **Crown Canopy** (華蓋, *Huágài*), and **connecting with the heart**, **liver**, and **spleen-stomach**. Doing this **three times**, then **visualize two channels of white *qi* between the stomach**, **further observing the two kidneys**; from between the kidneys, **two channels of white *qi* emerge at the **paravertebral region** (夹脊, *Jiājí*), **twisting like a carp**, ascending into the **Brain Marrow** (泥丸, *Níwán*). **From the face’s gate** to the **throat’s opening**, the **divine water overflows in the mouth**. This process, **three times**, is **one swallow**.

**From the middle elixir field**, **envelop with the heart**; **send it to the lower elixir field** and **halt**. This process, **three times**, is **one cycle**. **Igniting the fire** to **burn the divine water** stored in the **lower elixir field**, doing this **nine times**, is **one passage**. **Counting the saliva**, **nine passages** equal **eighty-one times**. **From Zǐ (子) to Wǔ (午)**, **this practice can be performed**; **with prolonged effort**, **its efficacy will become evident.**"*」

Thus arises the **Yellow River’s reverse flow**—why? Beneath the nape and beside the throat lie **two meridians**, the **Path of Longevity**. Pressing them with the hands yields **two hundred pulses**; beneath the wrists, **two more meridians** exist—**the Four Symbols’ encircling orbit**. First the left, then the right; pressing each yields **fifty pulses**.

Within the **Two Thresholds** stands the **Central Peak**—here lie **two meridians**, the **Golden Pass and Jade Lock**, the **Two Ravines**. Pressing them yields **eight hundred pulses**. At the edges of the **Two Flanks**, the **Tendons of the Leaping Blade** hold **two meridians**—the **Path of the Supreme One**. Pressing each yields **two hundred pulses**. Practice this daily, and its efficacy shall manifest.

After the **Winter Solstice**, prioritize the **heavy**; after the **Summer Solstice**, prioritize the **light**.

**Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"I have heard of the **soaring union of Sun and Moon**, the **true transformation of the Five Phases**.*

**Earth begets Metal**, Metal begets Water, Water begets Wood, Wood begets Fire, Fire begets Earth.
The **begetter is the Mother**; the **begetten is the Child**.

**Earth subdues Water**, Water subdues Fire, Fire subdues Metal, Metal subdues Wood, Wood subdues Earth.
The **subduer is the Husband**; the **subdued is the Wife**.

The **kidneys are Water**, dwelling below; the **heart is Fire**, dwelling above; the **liver is Wood**, dwelling to the left; the **lungs are Metal**, dwelling to the right; the **spleen is Earth**, dwelling centrally.

Thus, the **logic of begetting and subduing** rests within humanity, as **qi transmits**—beginning with the **kidneys**. The **kidney’s qi** transmits to the liver (**Water begets Wood**); when the **kidney’s qi is full**, the **liver’s qi arises**, transmitting to the heart (**Wood begets Fire**); when the **liver’s qi is full**, the **heart’s qi arises**, transmitting to the spleen (**Fire begets Earth**); when the **heart’s qi is full**, the **spleen’s qi arises**, transmitting to the lungs (**Earth begets Metal**); when the **spleen’s qi is full**, the **lung’s qi arises**, transmitting to the kidneys (**Metal begets Water**); when the **lung’s qi is full**, the **kidney’s qi arises**—**cycling endlessly**, as **qi and fluids transmit**, with the **heart as origin**.

The **heart’s fluid** transmits to the lungs (**Fire subdues Metal**); when the **heart’s fluid arrives**, the **lung’s fluid flows**, transmitting to the liver (**Metal subdues Wood**); when the **lung’s fluid arrives**, the **liver’s fluid flows**, transmitting to the spleen (**Wood subdues Earth**); when the **liver’s fluid arrives**, the **spleen’s fluid flows**, transmitting to the kidneys (**Earth subdues Water**); when the **spleen’s fluid arrives**, the **kidney’s fluid flows**, transmitting to the heart (**Water subdues Fire**); when the **kidney’s fluid arrives**, the **heart’s fluid flows**—**cycling endlessly**.

If the **heart’s fluid lacks the kidney’s qi**, it **stagnates**; if the **kidney’s qi does not align with the heart’s fluid**, it **fails to generate**. **Fluids circulate between Husband and Wife**; **qi transmits between Mother and Child**. **Wood lodges in Metal’s domain**; **Metal conceals Wood’s essence**—**inverted and reversed**, in **subduing and begetting**.

In my **central qi cultivation**, I sought the **true water**; within the water, the **true qi**. The **true fluid** internally unites with the **true qi** for **forging**. **Nurture the yin to solidify the yang**; **nurture the yang to dissolve the yin**. To **preserve form and dwell in the world**, one may **refine essence into substance**; to **shed substance and ascend as an immortal**, one may **refine qi into spirit**.

This **Dao** is governed by the **Moon’s waxing and waning**, discerns **yin and yang by the Sun**, and **judges ebb and flow by the hour**. Within its timing, **numbers are applied**; within its realm, **forms are revealed**. Without **directly serving the numinous**, yet **distinguishing the Five Phases’ logic**, one may **enter the realm of Xi Yí** and **achieve great efficacy.**

**Zhì Yóuzǐ** once sang of the **Golden Elixir**:

*"Take the essence of things,
Nurture their brilliance;
Gather in my **elixir field**—
There my elixir dwells.

What is my elixir?
**Lead, mercury, cinnabar**—
Guest and host in harmony,
Like a nest cradling crows.

Sow with **Steel and Water**,
Plow with the **Red Serpent**,
Nurture with **Fire and Wood**,
Irrigate with the **River Chariot**—
Thus root, thus pearl,
Thus bud, thus bloom.
By day, forge in fire—
Glowing, vermilion clouds;
By night, bathe in water—
Pale, pristine blossoms.
The **Golden Elixir** forms—
Daily, think without deceit."*

**Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"How does one summon the **Water of the Flowering Pool**? I have heard that **rolling the tongue to lick the **Palate Suspension***, practiced for a full day, causes the **tendons beneath the tongue to tighten and ache**. I gradually trained myself until the **tip of the tongue reached the Palate Suspension**—thus summoning the **Water of the Flowering Pool**; nothing is swifter than this."*

**Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"How does the **soaring of Sun and Moon** occur? Sit upright, **concentrating spirit and stabilizing qi**. With the **left hand clasping beneath the navel**, the **right hand gripping the upper thigh**, imagine **great smoke and flame**, burning the **heart first**, then the **liver, the lungs**. Then, **release a slight breath through the nose** to clear the passage.

After a moment, again imagine the **fire descending to burn the elixir field**. When it grows **intensely hot**, by day visualize the **Sun’s light**; by night, the **Moon’s light**—or visualize nothing at all. When burning the **heart**, do so briefly; when burning the **elixir field**, prolong it.

Next, stand on **bent knees**, with **both hands clasping them**, letting the **heat circulate through the body**. When the heat is extreme, cease. This practice knows no fixed time.

When I am **full from eating**, I **circulate fire**—thus **digestion occurs instantly**. Why? **Hang the arms, tuck the feet**, **shake the abdomen**, **gather the qi**, and **recline**. When the **qi is full**, **roll onto the back**—thus the **fire ascends."*

**Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"I wish to **ascend the Three Palaces**—what is the method?"*

The **Master** gathers his feet, using the middle finger of his left hand to press upon the **Lower Palace**—the **Lower Palace** being that which lies above the navel. With the right hand forming the **True Martial Seal** to pinch the breath at the nostrils, he lets the **qi** fill fully before releasing it slightly. Thus, three times.

Then **Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"Stretch out both feet, hang both arms, and when the **qi** is full, recline backward with the body raised. Thus, five times—this is the **Five Qi’s Return to the Primordial**."*

Then **Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"Rub my hands until they grow hot, then with the left hand clasping below the navel, use the right hand to assist. Thus, sitting cross-legged, close the eyes and visualize the **heart’s essence** descending to the **kidneys**, the **kidney’s qi** ascending to the **heart**, circulating endlessly above and below. When practiced for long, the region below the navel burns like fire—this is the **foundation of the Elixir Field**."*

Then **Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"Cross the feet, alternating left and right hands, clasping the lower abdomen. Then, through the nose, inhale the **Western White Qi** seven times; next, inhale the **Southern Red Qi** three times; then, inhale the **Eastern Green Qi** nine times; then, inhale the **Northern Black Qi** five times. Finally, facing south and tilting the head back, inhale the **Central Yellow Qi** once. This is the **True Transformation of the Five Phases**."*

Then **Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"With the middle finger of the left hand pressing the center of the navel—the **Navel Heart**—use the right hand to cup the **external kidneys**, pressing with the middle finger at the **tailbone**. Then visualize the **Sun and Moon descending together into the Elixir Field**, waiting until the **qi** is full before releasing it slightly. Thus, three times—this is the **Stirring of Fire**. This is the **Sun and Moon’s Flight in Union**."*

Then **Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"Raise the palms upward to regulate the **Three Burners**. The **liver** on the left, the **lungs** on the right—like shooting a hawk. **Standing alone in the West**, this stabilizes the **spleen and stomach**; **turning back to gaze**, this harmonizes **injury and fatigue**; **bowing high and low to Heaven**, this opens the **Five Viscera**; **swallowing saliva to nourish the **qi**, and with left and right hands plucking the **hand tendons**, shaking the **cicada’s tail**, this loosens **heart distress**; with left and right hands grasping the feet, this treats the **lumbar region**."*

Then **Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"Straighten the body and raise outward, quieting the mind and closing the breath. Place the hands above the abdomen and flanks, then leap upward, pulling the toes, rising and falling alternately, exhaling slightly—prioritizing frequency over force."*

Then **Zhì Yóuzǐ** said: *"**Fu** is **seven**, the **young maiden**, the **lungs**. It governs the **intent**—when the **intent moves**, thought arises. Thus, repeatedly descending the **vital breath**, the **nature matures**. If the **minor male** unites, **semen is lost**. **Kūn** is **two**, the **earth**, the **small intestine**. The **Spirit of the Curved River** cannot be measured. If **Earth Mother** ascends from **Kān** and unites with it, the **essence is refined into elixir**.*

**Qián** is **six**, **heaven**, **metal**, the **father**, the **large intestine**. The **kidney’s palace** lies in **Kān**, its **temple** in **Qián**—the **kidney** can unite with **Gèn**. **Bian Que** said: *"The **large intestine** is the **Gate of Vital Breath**—if it refines the **qi**, the **Central Earth** responds naturally. **Central Earth** refers to the **spleen and stomach**. This is the **Yellow Dao’s method of refining qi**.*

**Lí** is **nine**, the **heart’s fire**, the **young maiden**, governing the **spirit**. When the **spirit is settled**, it transcends **emptiness**; when **disturbed**, it loses count and wanders. Thus, the **nine** depends on recognizing **three, five, one, two, eight** before uniting with **nine and three**. Then all **pulses circulate through the Five Essences**, ascending and merging to transform into **spirit**. Within, the **method’s vessel** can elevate the **spirit**, allowing **piercing qi** to enter the **Purple Treasury** and see the **Dao**."*

**Kān** is **one**, the **kidney’s water**, the **middle male**. **One** is the **number of essence**. **Nine** is its **wandering**; **one** is its **obscurity**. If united, the **numbers are lost**; if pushed to extremes, **essence leaks**, and the **vital breath descends**, becoming a **ghost**. Before reaching the extreme, it can be controlled—this is its **manifestation**.*

**Xùn** is **four**, **wind**, the **gallbladder**, the **eldest daughter**. It governs the **multitude**—fear can subdue its **multitude**.*

**Gèn** is **eight**, **mountain**, the **ghost gate**, the **young male**, the **bladder**. When **qi** reaches here, **death is near**. As a **son’s successor**, its **numbers extend beyond**.*

For those who cultivate and refine, before speaking of the **Dao**, initially, through **artifice**, one arrives at **essence within**. With **essence**, one refines **qi**, governing the **intent** as **essence** reaches the **vital breath**. Its **desires** follow the **soul**—to the **heart**, to the **liver**, to the **spleen**, to the **lungs**, to the **kidneys**. The **Five Essences descend**; at their peak, they **transform into ghosts**!

**Zhèn** is **three**, **thunder**, its **body wood**, the **liver**, the **eldest son**. It can **settle the nature** and **elevate the qi**! Its essence lies in this: when the **metallic wind** rises from the **yang** of **Kān**, the **spirit flourishes**. Practiced through the **twelve double-hours without ceasing**, one attains **immortality**!

Now, my **body and form** are counted thus: the **top** is called the **Crown**; below it is the **Purple Treasury**—the **ears**, **eyebrows**, **eyes**, **nose**, **mouth**; below it is the **Primordial Palace**, the **pathway to the Highest Dao**. Below it is the **throat**; below it is the **Double Tower**; below it is the **Meeting of the Throat and Heart**; below it is the **Pulse**; below it is the **Heart**, the **Mother of Qi**, the **law within the diaphragm**. Below it are the **liver and gallbladder**; below it is the **spleen**; below it is the **stomach**—the **stomach’s strike** is the **small intestine**, the **small intestine’s strike** is the **bladder**, the **bladder** returns to the **kidneys**, which are the **heart’s network**. The **small intestine’s left** is the **large intestine**; below it is the **Lower Technique**—this is called the **Diagram of One Qi**."*

The Master Youzi said: "Excellent! The *Shangqing Zifu* teachings state: 'To swallow the *qi* and light of the sun and moon'—this is the method of refining the **Red Elixir (赤丹)**, the **Essence of Gold (金精)**, the **Luminous Spirit of Stone (石景)**, and the **Mother of Water (水母)**.

Its practice is as follows: When the sun rises, face east and strike your teeth nine times with your tongue, close your eyes tightly, and visualize the five-colored effulgent *qi* of the sun as flowing mist, all entering through your mouth. When the moon rises, face west and strike your teeth twelve times with your tongue, close your eyes tightly, and visualize the five-colored luminous *qi* of the moon as flowing mist, all entering through your mouth. Within the moon’s light is a yellow *qi*, and its pupils are the **Essence of Flying Yellow (飞黄)**, the **Moon’s Radiance (月华)**, and the **Jade Capsule (玉胞)**.

If I can cultivate this, then I shall rush into the sun and moon and become an immortal.

The Master Youzi said: "The *Shangqing Zifu* teachings are subtle indeed, and I shall now expound their coarse aspects.

At dawn, stand in an open place and gaze toward the east, observing the sun’s emergence and its colors, lights, and *qi* forms until you are thoroughly familiar with them after many days. Then, during the **Yin Leak (寅漏)**—after three *ke* (刻) and before four *ke*—sit slightly on a couch, strike your teeth nine times while facing east, and kneel with your legs folded. Hold your hands tightly, opening the **Heavenly Gate (天门)**—the Heavenly Gate refers to the two nasal passages. Close the **Earthly Door (地户)**—the Earthly Door refers to the mouth. Visualize the sun’s initial *qi* rising before your eyes, drawing it in through your nose and letting it enter your mouth. Wait until your mouth is filled with *qi*, then rinse your mouth **forty-nine times** in an empty manner. With utmost effort, swallow it, imagining the *qi* reaching the **Elixir Field (丹田)**. Strike your teeth repeatedly—this is called **Ingesting the Sun’s Essence (服日精) in one cycle**."

For those cultivating the **First Earthly Stage (初地)**, you may advance to three cycles.

The Master Youzi said: "This is the Sun’s Essence. There is also the **Nine Return Method (九还之方)**. Between the **Child Hour (子)** and the **Peril Hour (午)**, face east and rinse your mouth twelve times, mingling the **Dragon (龙)** and **Tiger (虎)**—this is called **Ingesting the Sun’s Essence in one cycle**, known as the **Red Cycle Child (红圆子)**.

From the **Child Hour (子)** to the **Peril Hour (巳)**, these are the so-called **Six Yang Times (六阳之时)**. Face east, and with the **left and right nostrils**, exhale and inhale to draw in the pure *qi*, filling your mouth with it. Then, internally visualize a *qi* that is neither green, nor yellow, nor blue, nor verdant—like the sun’s color and light. For each rinse, rub your palms together once. The left hand represents the **Dragon (龙)**; the right hand represents the **Tiger (虎)**. When the rinsing reaches twelve times, the number of rubs is the same. Swallow on the left side, then on the right—this completes one cycle. One cycle is **Yang (阳)**; two cycles are **Yin (阴)**. For **Yang**, swallow on the left; for **Yin**, swallow on the right.

At first, ingest three cycles daily. After three decades (三旬), advance to five cycles on one day. After five decades (五旬), advance to seven cycles on one day. If desires are not yet eliminated, stop at seven cycles. If the **Tailbone Leak (尾闻)** is not yet sealed, and the *qi* leaks without being contained, it will be difficult to truly fill your abdomen. You must advance to ten cycles after seven decades (七旬), and after twenty decades (二十旬), refine the **Red Water (赤水)**. This is the method for eliminating the **Nine Vermin (九虫)** of accumulated malevolence.

Then, you may ingest the **Moon’s Essence (月精)**.

On the **second day of the month (月之二日)**, after the **Peril Hour (午)** and before the **Child Hour (子)**, these are the so-called **Six Yin Times (六阴之时)**. Face west, and the method is as before. Reduce the Sun’s Essence to five cycles, but do not abandon the Moon’s Essence—this is called the **White Cycle Child (白圆子)**. When the practice reaches sixteen days (旬有六日), and the supplementation reaches twenty decades (二十旬), then you no longer use the Moon’s Essence but rely solely on the Sun’s Essence.

For the five cycles: first ingest four, then use the remaining one to send to the **Elixir Field (丹田)**. Each month, send one cycle daily. In the second, third, fourth, and fifth months, increase one cycle each month until you reach five cycles. Then, constantly gaze at your reflection in a mirror, and ponder the **infant within your abdomen (腹之婴儿)** as resembling your form. In the seventh and eighth months, you will neither eat nor feel hunger. By the tenth month, you will reside in a **Quiet Chamber (静室)**, contemplating the exit through the **Heavenly Gate (天门)**. Close your eyes and do not look—if you do, your heart may tremble.

After three years, you may open your eyes again. But never stray far from your body.

When the second *ji* (紀) arrives, one emerges with clarity.

Then, employing the *bān yùn* method, the *xīn*’s *qi* is directed into the Lower Elixir Field (下丹田), ascending from the tail’s base up the spine, entering the brain—like the sound of wind and rain. The sand falls upon the face, its taste sweet; it must not be discarded. This is what nourishes and flourishes the five *zàng* organs.

The *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: At the *xū-hài* hours (戌亥), close your eyes, still your mind, and sit upright. Let the nasal *qi* subtly settle. Then, cultivate the thought of swallowing saliva. If weary, rest. When the hour of *zǐ* arrives, face south—or east—and sit upright, cutting off all thought. Let the nasal *qi* move once and dwell in the mind. Shortly, let it move again, as before. With one breath of *qi*, swallow and send it to the navel. With both hands lightly embracing the navel wheel, quickly contract the *gǔdào*, then move another breath, driving the previous two breaths of *qi* past the navel before contracting again. Gently press the abdomen, awaiting the fire’s descent below the navel, where it grows hot. The waist and hips gradually rise, ascending until the *qi* passes the tailbone—then waist and hips grow hot. Thus, exhale from the chest and tighten the *bì*, leaning against the two *jiā* (夹) to steady it. Do not let the empty intestines rise first; wait until the fire’s *qi* fully reaches the *jiājǐ* (夹脊), then open the *jiājǐ*’s double gates. Quickly tilt the head back, contract the neck toward heaven—do not let the empty *yáng* rise first. When the fire arrives, quickly nod and shake the neck, directing the fire into the *suǐhǎi* (髓海). Only then draw it past the *Tiānmén* (天门), through twelve tiers of pavilions, to the *Jiānggōng* (绛宫), entering the Elixir Field. This is the method of kindling fire at the *Yángguān* (阳关).

The *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: From *chén-wǔ* until before *wǔ*, sit quietly with closed eyes, setting aside all thought. Let the breath move subtly, then saliva fills the mouth. Do not spit nor swallow—press down to settle the true dragon, preventing its ascent. Gently draw the nasal *qi* to rouse the true tiger, pressing the abdomen to prevent its descent. The abdomen must not be slackened; when the *qi* is full, release it slightly—but do not let it disperse. Then, let the breath move subtly again, filling the mouth with saliva, storing it without exhaustion. Initially, swallow dryly; next, let the heart surge. When it flows freely, divide it into three swallows. Thus, one may perform this once or thrice—this is called the *yuánzhū* (元珠).

The *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: Someone asked, “Is there also a method for seated repose?” He replied: “There is.”

Place your left foot atop the right knee, extending the right foot outward. With both hands, grasp beneath the second crease of the middle fingers, then after a moment, use the left hand to massage the right flank **sixty-four times**. Next, place the right foot atop the left knee, extending the left foot outward, maintaining the same grip, and use the right hand to massage the left flank **sixty-four times** as well.

Then, sit cross-legged and massage above the navel—**thirty-two times** on each side—first massaging the hands, then the kidney chambers, and finally the shoulders (three times each). Strike the cheeks with the *Red Dragon* **fourteen times** each, the upper and lower lips **seven times** each, and the central teeth **seven times**. Twist the tongue and stir it **three times**; when saliva arises, hold it in the mouth and steady the breath for a moment.

Pinch the nostrils with both hands and swallow fire **three times**, ensuring no water descends. Then divide the saliva into two portions, pinch the nostrils, and swallow it with a sound. This is the method of seated repose.

As *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: Sit cross-legged, with the left hand cupping the external kidney and the right hand gripping firmly, subtly circulating the *qi*. Then, visualize fire burning the heart, extending to the lungs and liver. When warmth arises, next visualize the fire descending to the *elixir field*, then to the *tail bone*. Lift the body, waiting for the sensation to pass; then visualize it passing through the *Upper Pass*, bow slightly forward, and let it enter the *mud pellet*, reaching the crown, the brain, descending through the *Celestial Court*, and returning to the heart, lungs, liver, and *elixir field*—repeating this **nine times**. This is the *Nine Circulations of the Returned Elixir*.

As *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: Excessive exhalation is inferior to minimal exhalation, and minimal exhalation is inferior to no exhalation. If one cannot retain even a single inhalation and exhalation, then the *qi* of heaven and earth will be stolen by it. Some call swallowing *qi* "fetal breathing," others count breaths, close them, endure them, or store them—but this is not the ultimate. Truly, when internal *qi* does not escape and external *qi* does not enter, the spirit governs the *qi*, the nostrils do not lose breath, and the two *qi*s ascend and descend endlessly between the *mud pellet* and *elixir field*. Buddhists call this *fetal breathing*; Daoists call it *Taiyi Embracing True Qi*; and scholars call it nurturing the *Hàorán* (浩然) *qi*. Though paths differ, their destination is the same.

As *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: I shall now seize and refine the *Golden Essence*—there is a method. Choose the hour of *Zi* (子, midnight), sit upright facing east, left hand pressing the knee, right hand pressing the thigh. Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth **twenty-seven times**, clasp the hands at the waist and nod the head **seven times**, waiting until the *qi* grows warm and then the *mud pellet’s* original *qi* enters. Clasp the hands alternately, binding them tightly **three times**; then extend both feet flat on the mat, grasping the toes with both hands in unison and moving them back and forth **seven times**. Return to the initial seated posture and rest. Hug the right breast with the left arm, extending the right hand, and strike backward as if angry **seven times**; then hug the left breast with the right arm, repeating the motion. My practice lies in *precision of essence* without interruption, thus performing the *Jade Maiden’s Cloud Branch Dance* **twelve times**, pressing left and right as before. Perform *dry swallowing* and *saliva swallowing* once each. When practiced until the **fifty-fifth day**, the *essence-qi* circulates through the four limbs, advancing without ceasing—thus attaining longevity.

As *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: Stand facing south or north, pinch paper to block the nostrils, and when sneezing arises, remove it. Bend the wrists downward, then open them backward like a phoenix spreading its wings, and fold them forward in embrace **three times**. Raise the sleeves with both hands, covering the mouth and nose, and nod the head **three times**; then extend the left arm fully to shake the shoulder **three times**, and repeat with the right. Next, clasp the hands in reverse, fingers pointing outward, bowing the face to the ground, and cup the hands as if cradling a heavy object, lifting them to the mouth **three times**. Then kick the left foot to the buttocks **three times**, and repeat with the right. Clasp the *elixir field* with both hands, straining at the nose to rouse the *qi* and swallow it. Enter the *Lower Elixir Field* **three times**, then pause when the breath harmonizes and cease. Practice without fixed timing, but do so frequently.

As *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: The methods of nurturing life are five:
1. *Prolonging Life by Descending Fire*—when heart-*qi* reaches the *elixir field*, then lift and contract;
2. *Taiyi Embracing True Qi*—when the *qi* of the lungs, heart, and liver all descend to the *elixir field*, then lift and contract;
3. *Jade Maiden Dividing the Fetus*—lie on the right flank, placing the external kidney outside the thigh, avoiding heat to prevent the *qi* from dispersing;
4. *Golden Crystal Flying Behind the Elbow*—when the *qi* of the lungs, heart, and liver descend to the *elixir field*, turn left and right **eighty-one times** each;
5. *Opening the Heavenly Gate, Closing the Earthly Door, Striking the Three Passes*—clench the hands and feet, focusing intent on the dual passes of the spine, where black *qi* entwines with red *qi*, ascending to the *mud pellet*. I then nod the head several times.

Yet closing the Three Passes also has its method. Strike the nose and gently press the lower abdomen, and the heart will naturally lift, the essence will reverse upward, and the pulse will pause—thus the *Upper Pass* is closed.

As *Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: The ancient sages had methods of *xū* (嘘, inhaling), *yàn* (咽, swallowing), *hē* (呵, exhaling sharply), *chuī* (吹, blowing), *hū* (呼, exhaling), and *xī* (嘻, laughing-breath). Always at the hour of *Zi*, sit cross-legged and steady the breath, drawing the abdomen through the nose until full.

Hē is practiced three times, hū twelve times, and yàn jìn (swallowing saliva) three times.
At the hour of *Mao*, facing east, hū is practiced twelve times, yàn seven times, xī twelve times, and yàn jìn three times.
At the hour of *Wu*, facing south, yàn is practiced seven times, chuī five times, xī twelve times, and yàn jìn three times.
At the hour of *You*, facing west, xū nine times, hē three times, xī twelve times, and yàn jìn three times.

What is xū? Clench the fists with both hands, gaze upward, and then exhale sharply.
What is yàn? Hug the knees with both arms, tilt the head back, and then swallow.
What is hē? Clasp the hands behind the head, tilt the head back, and then exhale sharply.
What is chuī? Extend the arms outward, clench the fists, and then blow.
What is hū? Let the arms hang loosely, embrace the spleen region in front, and then exhale.
What is xī? Sit upright with the head tilted back and laugh-breath.

The lungs correspond to the *qi* wheel. When the *qi* wheel is diseased—sometimes like clouds obscuring the sun, then suddenly clearing, or like the *Great Storehouse* (stomach) with heat and constipation—swallowing (yàn) is appropriate.
The spleen corresponds to the inner wheel. When the inner wheel is diseased—flanks swollen and painful, lips parched—exhaling (hū) is appropriate.
When the throat swells, laugh-breath (xī) is appropriate.
The kidneys correspond to the water wheel. When the water wheel is diseased—seeing one object as two, the sun appearing as if viewed through water, or a *ling* (resonance) beneath the navel—blowing (chuī) is appropriate.
The heart corresponds to the blood wheel. When the blood wheel is diseased—fleshy growths encroaching on the eyes, or heat in the diaphragm—exhaling sharply (hē) is appropriate.
The liver corresponds to the wind wheel. When the wind wheel is diseased—wind rushing out upon sight, mist or smoke arising—exhaling sharply (xū) is appropriate.

*Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: I have heard the teachings of the Three Fires.
The *Min Fire* is the external kidney. At sunset, gather the *Min Fire* twenty-seven times, then collect water thirty-six times, forming one swallow into the *Elixir Field* (Dan Tian). Gently press and massage the external kidney once, then water flows downward from above while the *Min Fire* of the external kidney enters from without—water and fire nourishing each other.

The *Chen Fire* is the internal kidney. When refining the sea at the hour of *Xū-Hài* (7–9 PM), first cup the external kidney with the left hand, and knead beneath the navel with the right hand, drawing up the *Chen Fire* to cook the *Elixir Field*, causing yin to diminish while yang grows. Each hand moves eighty-one times, completing one cycle.

The *Jun Fire* is the heart. After the hour of *Hài*, sit quietly, circling the *Elixir Field* with the mind’s intent—first left, then right—each rotation eighty-one or three hundred sixty times. Then the heart’s *Jun Fire* descends, merging with the internal kidney’s *Chen Fire* and the external kidney’s *Min Fire*. The Three Fires converge and condense into the elixir, known as the *Complete Heavenly Fire*.

*Zhì Yóuzǐ* says: Fire is taken at the hours of *Yín, Wǔ,* and *Xū*. Sit in a quiet chamber, placing thick mats on the couch, cross-legged and facing south. Cup both hands around the kidneys, pressing beneath the navel’s *wheel*. Calm the mind, letting inner and outer be as one. Then focus intently on the *wheel*’s interior, where a substance exists—
As large as a pellet, its hue like cinnabar, its brilliance like the sun. Make the breath entering through the nose exceedingly subtle, letting each inhalation store within the pellet. If a thought arises, swiftly dispel it with spirit, then refocus on the pellet, ensuring all breath enters it. Gradually, warmth spreads through the navel’s *wheel*, growing like fire. Then strike the teeth ninety times, rinse the mouth with saliva nine times, each swallow directed by intent into the *mud pellet*. Then practice the fire-raising method: strike the teeth ninety times, swallow saliva nine times nine times, and close the breath three times.

Next, rub the palms until hot, first massaging the tail of the eyes several times. Then rub the palms, applying heat to the nose several times. Next, rub the palms, applying heat to both ears several times. Then rub the palms, applying heat to the face and neck until warm. Finally, open and close the breath alternately, drawing a bow three times.

If this method is practiced daily, it can ward off the eight evils, preserving the face and form from decay—this is called *minor refinement of form*.

Why must fire be taken at these three times? *Yín* is when fire thrives; *Wǔ* is its imperial hour; *Xū* is its grave. Practicing this dispels yin and strengthens the yang spirit.

With prolonged practice, performing it twelve times a day, thought naturally becomes clear and unclouded, and in darkness, inner and outer become luminous. This is the sign of elixir completion, full vitality, and abundant *qi*.

When true *qi* is abundant, the spirit becomes clear and refreshed. One can go without food yet not feel hunger, and foreknow events before they occur. This is the sign of Dao completion.

A hundred days’ practice cures lingering illnesses; two hundred days make the navel firm and *qi* robust; three hundred days condense essence and *qi* into the elixir.

At first, gradually increase effort, practicing for half a candle-hour, then extending the duration. When perfected, warmth turns to heat within, and inner vision reveals the pellet clearly. Then *qi* flows smoothly, the spirit steadfastly guards without loss, and all breath is drawn into the pellet—still and unaware of its presence. This is called *breath condensing in the embryo, the embryo dwelling with the breath*.

With prolonged practice, suddenly one forgets self and object, both merging into emptiness, the body filled with heat and sweat. This is the sign of the *embryonic immortal*’s attainment.

「If one suffers from an ailment, one should immediately close the breath and inhale several times, allowing sweat to flow until the condition ceases, then resume the method of *rising fire* (起火之法). The illness shall then be removed.

As for the Wandering Student (游子), someone asked: Why, when practicing the first stage of Dao (初地修进), are the four methods (四法) employed simultaneously? The Wandering Student replied: The day has four times, each corresponding to the cycles of Heaven and Earth’s *yin* and *yang* (阴阳之数). The four times of Heaven and Earth are spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the four times of the sun and moon are waxing, waning, dark, and new. The four times of humanity are the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.

At the hour of *zi*, the heart-*qi* (心气) enters the kidneys (肾), its fire residing below (在下), and thus the true-*qi* (真气) of the kidneys ascends. At the hour of *mao*, the true-*yang* (真阳) follows the victory of *yin*-*qi* (阴气) and arrives at the waist (腰), while the lesser *yang* (少复) returns to its original position, dividing the *yin* and *yang* *qi* (阴阳二气) into forward and backward movements. For males, this is the left *yang* (阳); for females, this is the *yin* (阴). One should then use the method of *rising fire* and *dispersing qi* (升火散气).

At the hour of *wu*, the kidney-*qi* (肾气) enters the heart (心), and thus the *yin* descends from the Nine Heavens (九天) to above the throat and diaphragm (咽膈之上), dividing and moving forward and backward. At the hour of *you*, the *yin*-*qi* (阴气) weakens and kills vitality, while the *yang*-*qi* (阳气) grows feeble. One should then use the method of *gathering qi* to *nourish yang* (聚气养阳) and assist its restoration.

Thus, the four methods (四法) are the daily practices (一日之用). The hours of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* mark the time when *yang*-*qi* is just beginning to arise. To elevate the true *yang*-*qi* (一阳之真气), one must sit quietly until dawn (达旦), avoiding loud speech or vigorous conversation. One may converse with others, but should not engage in heated discussions. If one speaks daily, one should reply in a calm voice. After social interactions (应接之劳), during the evening of the *zi* hour, one should cease practice and rest. When the time reaches *bing* (鹰呜), one may resume.

If, before the day of the *yang*-*qi*’s full ascension (南至), one has not yet elevated the true *yang*-*qi*, then at the evening of the *yang*-*qi*’s full ascension (南至之夕) and the next day at the hour of *xiao* (小至) and *zi*, one should perform the practice again. If one has already elevated the true *yang*-*qi* before the *yang*-*qi*’s full ascension, then performing it again at the hours of *xiao* (小至) and *zi* after the *yang*-*qi*’s full ascension is also beneficial. It is not necessary to sit until dawn.

In general, *qi* (气) ascends from the *yongquan* (涌泉) before the *yang*-*qi*’s full ascension (十一月), reaching the knees (膝) in the eleventh month, the thighs (股) in the twelfth month, and the waist (腰) in the first month. This is called the *Three Yang* (三阳) completion. In the second month, it reaches the arms (膊), in the third month the neck (颈), in the fourth month the crown (顶), and after the fifth month, the *yin*-*qi* follows the same pattern. Therefore, those who study the Dao (学道者) should practice abstinence from desires (绝嗜欲) in the fourth month and the tenth month to avoid the pure *yang* and pure *yin* phases (纯阳纯阴之用事).

The Wandering Student further said: Sit upright and close your eyes, imagining the heart as the *Grandmother* (诧女), the kidneys as the *Infant* (婴儿). First, warm the kidneys until they feel hot, then stir the fire to rise upward. Next, inhale through the nose to draw in the clear *qi*, visualizing the *wind-qi* of Heaven (天之风气) passing through nine times (九过). Exhale the *Grandmother*’s *qi* along with the *Dragon Fire* (龙火), letting them meet below and see the *Infant*. The *Infant* then rises again, meeting the *Grandmother* as husband and wife unite (交合焉). This is the *Dragon-Tiger* (龙虎) interaction in practice.

To inhale the *qi*, close the mouth, shut the eyes, and sit upright. With both hands clasping the external kidneys (外肾), cultivate warmth and heat until it permeates, then use the mind’s intention to embrace the kidney-*qi* as it ascends and guides it upward. If the breath is drawn in swiftly, imagine the heart as the *Grandmother* uniting with the kidneys and merging their essences (合精). Then imagine the kidneys as the *Male* responding and uniting in turn, ascending and descending fifteen times (十五过) until the essence settles in the body. Guide the essence upward into the heart, then let the heart’s blood descend again. Repeat this ascending and descending process twenty-one times (三七过).

Finally, store the essence in the *Spleen Palace* (脾宫) and seal it. This is known as the *Three Lineages Dwelling Together* (三姓同居), located above the heart and below the navel, its size like a ring (环). Next, use the *Six Yang Fire* (六阳之火) to forge it and the *Six Yin Water* (六阴之水) to irrigate it, practicing the *Nine-One* (九一) method of interaction day and night.

Thus, when the heart moves, the lungs, liver, gallbladder, and small intestine all move in response, aiding the heart. When the kidneys move, the external kidneys, bladder, large intestine, and spleen all move in response, aiding the kidneys. Therefore, the heart and kidneys are both the masters of cultivating the True Essence (俱修真之主).

The Wandering Student further said: The *Three Arcana* (三魄) are named *Day Spirit* (爽灵), *Day Essence* (幽精), and *Fetal Light* (胎光). The *Seven Arcana* (七魄) are named *Corpse Dog* (尸狗), *Crouching Spirit* (伏负), *Sparrow Yin* (雀阴), *Heavenly Thief* (天贼), *Non-Virtue* (非毒), *Purification* (除秽), and *Scent of Lungs* (嗅肺).

The *Three Primordial Spirits* (三元神) are named *Nurturing* (来育), each seven inches long (七寸). The *Stomach Spirit* (胃神) is three and a half inches long (三寸有半). The *Mud Pellet Spirit* (泥丸神) dwells between the eyebrows, three inches inward, and is named *Imperial Realm* (帝乡). The *Vermilion Palace Spirit* (绛官神) resides within the heart, one inch in length (一寸). The *Elixir Field Palace* (丹田官) is located two inches below the navel and is named *Grain Upright* (谷立). The *Heart Spirit* (心神) takes the form of the *Crimson Bird* (朱雀), nine inches long, and is named *Radiant Yang* (焕阳). The *Liver Spirit* (肝神) is named *Child* (童子), manifesting as two *Jade Maidens* (玉女), each nine inches long. The *Gallbladder Spirit* (胆神) dwells beneath the membrane, appearing as a *Jade Boy* (玉童) bearing a spear (执戟), and is named *Dragon Virtue* (龙德), three inches long. The *Lung Spirit* (肺神) is named *Luminous Flower* (皓华), three inches long, appearing as a *Jade Boy* bearing a weapon (执兵). The *Spleen Spirit* (脾神) is named *Precious Origin* (宝元), manifesting as three *Jade Maidens* (童女), seven inches and three divisions long (七寸三分). The *Kidney Spirit* (肾神) is named *Primordial Truth* (元真), resembling a *two-headed white deer* (白鹿而二首), three inches and seven divisions long (三寸七分).

The *Nine Vermin* (九虫) are named *Crouching Worm* (伏虫), four divisions long (四分), and the master of all vermin (群虫之主), dwelling between the intestines and stomach. It can transform into various diseases (能变成诸患). The *Hookworm* (蛔虫) is as long as a leech (蛭), four inches long (四寸), causing the abdomen to rumble (善令人腹呜). The *White Worm* (白虫) is one inch long (一寸), producing offspring up to four or five feet in length (乃至四五尺), capable of killing a person (能杀人). The *Flesh Worm* (肉虫) resembles a rotting apricot (烂杏), causing agitation and vexation (善令人烦懑). The *Lung Worm* (肺虫) resembles a silkworm (蚕), causing coughing (善令人咳嗽). The *Stomach Worm* (胃虫) resembles a toad (蟆), causing vomiting, spitting, and frequent belching (善令人呕逆吐、喜喊). The *Diaphragm Worm* (膈虫) resembles a slice of melon (瓜瓣), causing excessive salivation (善令人唾). The *Red Worm* (赤虫) resembles a leech (蛭), causing abdominal rumbling (善令人腹呜). The *Burning Worm* (烧虫) manifests as *scrofula*, *itching mange*, and *lichen* (为疽为疥为癣).」

**Volume Thirty-Six of *Dao Shu*—Collected by Youzi Zeng Kuò—The *Great Return Elixir* Chapter**

That which is born yet does not live—this is the Gate of Longevity;
That which dies yet does not perish—this is the Root of the Dao.

The Primordial Lord spoke: *"The Primordial Essence of the Great Yang generates that which does not live;
The Primordial Essence of the Great Yin causes that which does not die to perish.
That which is born yet does not live—this is the Gate of Longevity;
That which dies yet does not die—this is the Root of the Dao."*

The Supreme Sage said: *"What is meant by the Primordial Essence of the Great Yang?"*
The Primordial Lord replied: *"When yin and yang transform, they generate the Five Phases.
The Five Phases, in their mutual generation, conceive the numinous transformations.
Which is to say:
The essence of Earth generates the numinous fluid;
The essence of the numinous fluid generates white gold.
White gold is the essence of water, generating the red-luminous numinous sand;
The essence of the numinous sand generates the light of the Great Yang;
The essence of the Great Yang generates the Primordial *qi*;
The Primordial *qi* generates the numinous clarity.
Numinous clarity—this is the Gate of the Dao.
Thus, the Great Intestine is called the Primordial Yang.
It begins by gestating in the womb of white gold-water,
And becomes the Gate of the red-luminous numinous sand,
To merge with the Primordial *qi*,
To transmit the numinous clarity,
To harmonize yin and yang,
To reverse the Five Phases—
And thus the Primordial Essence is spontaneously generated."*

Master Xuan said: *"Its essence is the Great Return Elixir.
The so-called Great Return Elixir is that which the soul and spirit converge upon.
From the Fire position of the Southern Pole,
It transforms the Yin of *Ren* and *Gui* in the Northern Pole,
Passing through the Five Phases, its hue contains the Five Colors.
Its efficacy matches that of Heaven and Earth—
Its depth is unfathomable.
Its method consists of twelve stages,
Symbolizing the twelve months of a year.
The first is called *Hua Chi’s Primordial Mystery*.
The generating *qi* of the beginning,
Creating the forms of Heaven and Earth,
The numbers three and five,
Where male and female, pure and turbid, remain undivided—
The hidden dragon’s position.
The virtuous one, guarding the Dao,
Awaits the time to obtain it—
This is the crucible and furnace.
The *Classic* says: *Knowing white, guarding black, the numinous clarity comes of itself.*
Thus, the Mysterious is the mother of all things—
The secret of the Sage."*

The second is called *White Gold, Yellow Sprout*.
It is the refined gold flower from the Hua Chi elixir.
Congealing into chaos, it belongs to the initial stage of the alchemical robe,
Where the Mysterious Pass remains unopened,
Yin follows the Tiger, Yang follows the Dragon.
With the strength of *Gèn* for thirty days, it submits to *Lí*’s office,
After nine transformations, it returns—
And thus becomes the White Gold, Yellow Sprout,
Not the transformation of the Five Metals or Eight Stones.
Its origin lies in the union of *Kàn* and *Kūn*,
The flow of the Great Mysterious,
Sensing *qi* to form.
Like parents transmitting *qi* to give birth!
Thus, our supreme medicine—
The male of the Abyss, the female of the Flame—
Their natures depend on each other,
Their *qi* coalesces to form it.
Its symbol is the *Yì*’s second hexagram:
*The Dragon appearing in the field.*

The third is called *Five Phases*.
Water generates wood—this is *mercury*, not the *mercury* of the world;
Wood generates fire—this is *numinous sand*, not the *numinous sand* of the world;
Fire generates earth—this is *spiritual *qi*, not the *earth* of the world;
Earth generates metal—this is *white gold*, not the *metal* of the world;
Metal generates water—this is *black water*, not the *water* of the world.
Metal conquers wood, water conquers fire, earth conquers water, fire conquers metal.
Earth dominates the four seasons’ transitions,
Each spanning eight days in its net of influence.
Thus, the Five Phases’ generation and conquest form the supreme medicine.
It is said: *"Hold it to return to Heaven above,
And grant it the water’s gold within."*
After three years of fire, the nine transformations deepen.
At dusk, the Mysterious Crane cries in the clear shade.

The fourth is called *Four Symbols*: the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, the Dark Tortoise.
The Azure Dragon governs the Eastern direction—wood, *mercury*.
Its stem-branches are *Jia* and *Yi*—
Refined, it is not clear; stirred, it is not turbid,
Near it cannot be taken, far it cannot be abandoned—
Like the dragon hidden, transforming without limit.
The White Tiger governs the Western direction—metal.
Its stem-branches are *Gēng* and *Xīn*—
Obtaining the True One’s position, the essence of the utmost refinement.
Thus, the Sage says: *"The *Fu* female is the Azure Dragon’s mate,"*
For this is how the Five Phases generate each other—
The utmost essence and true *qi* congeal, subdue, and remain motionless.
To grasp one is to complete all things.
The Vermilion Bird governs the Southern direction—fire, *cinnabar*.
Its stem-branches are *Bǐng* and *Dīng*—
Severing fluid to form the dragon, congealing *qi* to form the tiger.
Its *qi* ascends to become Heaven, descends to become Earth.
Thus, the Great Elixir—when seen in fire—flies,
The Vermilion Bird’s symbol.
The Dark Tortoise governs the Northern direction—water, blackness.
Its stem-branches are *Rén* and *Guǐ*.
The *Laozi* says: *"The highest virtue is like water."*
Not lead, not tin, not stone—
The numinous essence of the River Vehicle,
The numinous water of the River Chariot.
Born before Heaven and Earth,
It can be yielding, it can be firm,
It can nurture all things—
Our crucible must contain all four symbols,
The so-called Four Spirit Elixirs.
When the four positions form dust,
They return to their original master,
Like the Water Official capturing beasts,
The Golden Gate becoming its neighbor.
Those who join are those whose natures align.
Through the mediator, the Dao grows ever closer.

The fifth is called *Clarifying the True Nature of Lead and Mercury*.
Lead is *Kàn*—congealed white;
Mercury is *Lí*—flowing fluid.
Thus, the River Vehicle’s water is *Lí*,
The Dragon’s fire unites with it.
Nourished by wood, it becomes clear without end.
Thus, the lead’s gate contains gold,
Gold within holds the Return.
Know that within black water,
White gold is born,
White gold transforms into yellow gold,
Yellow gold transforms into purple gold.

The five colors are abandoned—its name is the *Great Elixir of Return*. Why so?

White gold arises from lead and is born through water,
Thus the Dragon and Tiger bind themselves in the West to obtain it,
Transforming into yellow sprouts.
Yellow sprouts grow dependent on earth,
Taking on earth’s nature—hence, they are called *yellow sprouts*.

Water mingles with yellow, the moon intermingles with black,
Thus the revolving fan of black days and white months,
Taking their parent-child as one—
The crane’s cry in the shadow’s form.

Here, the tiger roars and the dragon bellows—
Things of like kind resonate with one another.

Thus, mercury is *nature*, lead is *emotion*—
The two unite in harmony.

How could the Dao of Nature’s constancy
Be an external thing?

The sixth is *Sun and Moon*—
The essence of Heaven and Earth, the sovereign of elixirs.

*Kàn* (the male) is symbolized by the moon;
*Lí* (the female) is symbolized by the sun.

The sun has the *cloven hoof*—a yin-like form;
The moon has the *lunar toad*—a yang-like being.

White gold is born from the River Vehicle—
Yin within yang;
Mercury comes from the *Spiritual Sand*—
Yang within yin.

What of its form and substance?
It is *profound and yet more profound*.

「Thus, the Sun and Moon dwell within the hands,
Where the *造化* (Creative Transformation) gives birth to their forms.
Hence, the left kidney is the Sun,
And the right kidney is the Moon.

*Guàn* (the male, Earth Trigram) collects the elixir in the *Lí* (the female, Fire Trigram) palace,
And returns it to the *Kàn* (the male, Water Trigram) gate.
With jade tripods and golden cauldrons, the Eight Trigrams are employed,
And the River Vehicle of black waters carries the sand and mercury.

This is the transmission of the *Sages* and the instruction of the *Worthy Ones*.

The seventh is *Bright Elixir* (明药),
The root of colored elixirs, born in conjunction with *profound waters* (玄水).
Thus, it governs white gold,
Which then transforms into yellow gold,
And yellow gold into purple gold.

He who obtains white gold becomes a *Earthly Immortal* (地仙),
He who obtains purple gold becomes a *Celestial Immortal* (天仙).
What is this Way?
It is a single substance manifesting in five hues,
Not an ordinary elixir—
Nourished by fire, contained in a *cauldron* (鼎),
It undergoes no change.

My elixir, however,
Moves with the Sun and Moon to the *Supreme Treasure* (至宝).
Begin the work at *zi* hour (子时),
Without ceasing, though in the sixth month fire is not used.
The *Yang Spirit* (阳神) shines with its portents,
And the *Yin Law* (阴律) radiates its luminous currents within its bounds.

He who recognizes the *infant* (婴儿),
Must grasp the *veil of the old woman* (姥女之帷).

Thus, it encompasses all that is coarse,
And penetrates all that is fine.
Its symbols descend from Heaven,
And it generates its own light.
Its symbols descend to Earth,
And the *wronged spirits* (冤魂) are freed from their *calamity* (涂炭).
Its symbols descend upon the body,
And the *form and spirit* (形神) ascend together to Heaven.

The eighth is *Nine Returns, Seven Circuits* (九还七返).
*Nine Returns* refers to the great cycle of a year,
Or the small cycle of a month—
Like the *Big Dipper’s* (北斗) degrees,
It completes the day and night.

Heaven descends and Earth ascends,
Giving birth and transformation to all things.
From *yín* (寅) to *shēn* (申),
This is the *Seven Circuits*.
Returning again to *kūn* (the Earth Trigram, 坤),
This is the *Nine Returns*.

To advance toward the *Immortal Way* (神仙),
One must obtain the *pure qi* (正气) of three thousand six hundred years.
Now, let us take the great cycle of a day’s twelve hours,
Six *yang* (阳) and six *yin* (阴),
With *yang* corresponding to spring and summer,
And *yin* to autumn and winter.

Thus, one hour represents the symbol of a day;
One day represents the symbol of a month.
A month has three *decans* (旬),
Totaling three hundred sixty hours—
The symbol of a year.
Extending this upward,
Twelve hours become twelve months,
Three hundred sixty days—
Is it not like three thousand six hundred years?

Thus, a man’s body is formed in ten months,
And the elixir is refined in ten months to break free from its *fetal bonds* (脱胎).
Are not the *human path* (人道) and the *elixir path* (药道) fundamentally aligned?

The ninth is *Selecting Friends* (择友).
A ruler without friends loses his kingdom,
A minister without friends loses his loyalty,
A commoner without friends loses his family,
And a *Way* without friends loses its *true essence* (飧其真).
To obtain a friend,
Is to select the day when the *qi* (气) aligns.

What is this alignment?
It is following the *sovereign qi* (王气).
A single action releases the *flowing pearls* (流珠),
And the five hues appear bright.

If the work begins at *Spring Day* (日春), *Summer Day* (日夏), *Autumn Day* (日秋), or *Winter Day* (日冬),
And the *qi* (汞) is pursued according to its nature,
Then *yin* and *yang* will invert,
And the matter will be left unfinished.

The tenth is *The Golden Cauldron* (金鼎).
The Golden Cauldron responds to Heaven above,
To man in the middle,
And to Earth below.
When Heaven and Earth respond in harmony,
Man prospers and attains longevity.

When Heaven tilts and Earth shifts,
All things perish.

Thus, the *Yijing* (易) says:
*Act before Heaven, and Heaven will not resist*,
*Follow Heaven after, and you will conform to Heaven’s timing*—
Even Heaven does not resist its master,
Who holds this Way.

What is called the *cauldron* (鼎) here,
Is not the ordinary cauldron—
Square outside, round within,
Its form like a chicken’s egg,
One inch in size,
From *non-being* (无) to *being* (有),
It contains the *chaotic qi* (混沌造化之气) of the *Creative Transformation*.
The *mysterious void* (幽阙) lies at its center.

The Yellow Emperor cast the cauldron on *Jīngshān* (荆山),
With precise measurements.
Its height is one foot two inches,
Its weight seventy-two pounds,
Its circumference one foot five inches,
Its base elevated two and a half inches from the ground,
The bottom’s thickness two inches,
The body’s thickness one inch and a half,
Its depth six inches,
The lid’s thickness one inch and a half,
Its handles one inch,
And its capacity three and a half *shēng* (升).

The top of the cauldron is *Heavenly Water* (天水),
Its bottom is *Earthly Fire* (地火),
And around its sides are the *Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions* (二十八宿).

The fire of the cauldron cannot be used for refining elixirs,
For its defects are ten in number—
As *Grass Clothing Child* (草衣子) has spoken of them.

The eleventh is *The Furnace of Supreme Unity* (太一之炉).
Here, *Heaven* (乾) and *Earth* (坤) serve as the furnace,
And *yin* and *yang* as the cauldron.
Its symbols correspond to the *Five Sacred Mountains* (五岳),
With twelve branches of the moon,
And altars erected according to the *Big Dipper’s* (北斗) position.

The altar has three tiers,
The furnace has eight gates,
Its height two feet,
Its thickness six inches,
Its circumference three feet five inches,
Its gate’s height two inches,
Its width one inch and a half for twelve branches,
And its perimeter one inch.

Thus, the furnace is the *citadel* (城) of the cauldron,
And it must not be allowed for *evil qi* (邪气) to intrude.

The twelfth is *The Furnace of the Flowering Pool* (华池之炉),
With a black moon above,
White sun below,
And the *Gathering Monkey’s* (聚猴) seat.

Begin the work at *zi* hour (子时) in the month of *Jiànzǐ* (建子).
Use fire according to the *Eight Nodes* (八节).
Set up eight gates to correspond to the *Eight Winds* (八风):
*Winter Solstice* (冬至) *Beginning Wind* (朔风),
*Spring Begins* (立春) *Tender Wind* (条风),
*Spring Equinox* (春分) *Clear and Gentle Wind* (明庶风),
*Summer Begins* (立夏) *Hot Wind* (炎风),
*Summer Solstice* (夏至) *Bright Wind* (景风),
*Autumn Begins* (立秋) *Cold Wind* (冻风),
*Autumn Equinox* (秋分) *Hurricane Wind* (闯阖风),
*Winter Begins* (立冬) *Widespread Wind* (广漠风).

Thus, the Eight Trigrams are positioned outside,
With the moon on the right and the sun on the left.
My elixir weighs three hundred eighty-four *zhǔ* (铢).

A year has three hundred sixty days,
And twenty-four *seasons* (气).
Thus, the day’s portion is twenty-five *zhǔ* and a half,
With six *liǎng* (两) and six *zhǔ* (铢) and one *shǔ* (黍) as a parameter.

When *yin* and *yang* reach the *Winter Solstice* (冬至),
And the *zi* hour (子辰) follows,
The fire is ignited.
It ends at *kūn* (Earth Trigram, 坤),
And the eleventh month is the repetition.

Open the *Gate of Astonishment* (惊门),
And the *Gate of Life* (生门),
For this is the *one yang born at Winter Solstice* (冬至一阳生).
One *liǎng* (两) and one *zhǔ* (铢) and a half,
With six *liǎng* (两) and one *shǔ* (黍) as a parameter,
Until the month’s end,
When the yang grows to thirty-two *liǎng* (两),
Its *dragon* (龙) still hidden.

Use one *jīn* (斤) of *Great Fire* (大火) over three days,
Or four *liǎng* (两) of fire for lesser quantities,
And the *Three Corpses* (三尸) will vanish of their own accord.

The White Tiger cannot yet be captured or subdued,
The Azure Dragon henceforth soars and roams.
This is what is meant.

The twelfth month is *Lín* (临, "Approaching").
Open the *Gate of Injury* (伤门),
And respond to the *Gate of Closure* (塞门).
By the month’s end, the *yang* qi reaches sixty-four *shí* (时),
This is the *nine-two*—the Dragon in the Fields (乾卦九二).
Use eight *liǎng* (两) of fire,
For the greater measure, three days of *yang* growth to nine-two,
With nine-five above in correspondence—
The medicine congeals and solidifies.
Thus it is said:
Within the *Lín* hexagram, the Azure Dragon moves,
Like spring’s misty breath, rain descending.
The sea’s waves rise toward Zhòngpēng Isle,
The Jade Gate sealed tight, shielding from dust and wind,
The Four Symbols aligned with *wù-jǐ* (戊己),
Who would believe in the divine power of *yin* and *yang*?
This is what is meant.

The first month is *Tài* (泰, "Peace").
Open the *Gate of Astonishment* (惊门),
And respond to the *Gate of Life* (生门).
By the month’s end, the *yang* qi reaches ninety-six *shí*,
This is the *nine-three*—the Virtuous One advancing in virtue and deeds (乾卦九三).
The *yang* qi descends, mingling with the Rainwater,
Refining the *Tàiyáng* (太阳),
For the greater measure, use eight *liǎng* of fire over three days to manifest the realm,
For lesser quantities, four *liǎng* over nine days.
Thus it is said:
In the *Tài* hexagram, the two *qi* are balanced,
The true medicine in the cauldron, clearly revealed;
The Dragon’s roar and Tiger’s growl are truly heard,
Lightning flashes, thunder rolls—shocking and profound;
Spring’s realm awakens, true fire descends,
Seizing the sun and moon, entering the Golden City.

The second month is *Dà Zhuàng* (大壮, "Great Strength").
Positioned at *nine-four*,
By the month’s end, the *yang* qi reaches one hundred twenty-eight *liǎng*,
External fire must not be used.
Thus it is said:
Within the jar, the sun and moon nourish the vital essence,
In the cauldron, red lotuses surge with emerald waves;
Press close to hear the voice of the *Lǎonǚ* (姥女),
Infants see the medicine and scatter in awe.
This is what is meant.

The third month is *Yāng* (央, "Central").
Opening the *Jīng* Gate (驚門), responding to the *Shāng* Gate (傷門),
Positioned at *nine-five*,
By the month’s end, the *yang* qi reaches one hundred sixty *liǎng*,
This is what is meant by *"the Flying Dragon in Heaven."*

The large dose uses two *jīn* of fire for three days;
The small dose, four *liǎng*, for fifteen days.
Thus it is said:
To subdue the White Tiger is no simple task,
To tame the Green Dragon is no chance occurrence;
Within the boiling cauldron, purple powder ascends,
Witness the fire’s transformation of gold and lead.
This is what is meant.

The fourth month is *Qián* (乾, "Heavenly").
Opening the *Shāng* Gate (傷門), responding to the *Jīng* Gate (驚門),
By the month’s end, the *yang* qi reaches one hundred ninety-two *liǎng*,
Positioned at *upper-nine*,
Using fire of two *jīn* and eight *liǎng*—
When the fire is strong, three days suffice;
For the small dose, four *liǎng* over eighteen days.
Thus it is said:
Harmonizing *qi* and climate in accordance with the seasons,
Refining the Five Phases into the Primordial Official.
This is what is meant.

The fifth month is *Rèn* (娠, "Pregnant").
Opening the *Xiū* Gate (休門), responding to the *Shēng* Gate (生門),
The *yin* grows by one *liǎng*, one *shú* (铢), half a *fēn* (分), and six *yī* (黍)—
The *yang* likewise flourishes.
By the month’s end, the *yin* qi reaches thirty-two *liǎng*,
Using fire of two *jīn* for three days;
For the small dose, four *liǎng* over eighteen days.
Thus it is said:
In the *Lí* Palace (離宮), herbs are gathered for the Primordial Spirit.
This is what is meant.

The sixth month is *Dùn* (遁, "Retreat").
Opening the *Xiū* Gate (休門), responding to the *Jīng* Gate (驚門),
Positioned at *six-two*.
By the month’s end, the *yin* grows to four *jīn*,
Using fire of one *jīn* and eight *liǎng* for three days;
For the small dose, four *liǎng* over twenty-one days.
Thus it is said:
Turning the Source’s waters, listening to the water clock’s drip,
In darkness, the red lotus fills ten isles.
This is what is meant.

The seventh month is *Pǐ* (否, "Obstruction").
Positioned and responding at *yín* (寅).
By the month’s end, the *yin* grows to six *jīn*,
The large dose uses fire of one *jīn* for three days;
The small dose, four *liǎng*, for twenty-four days.
Thus it is said:
Yellow sprouts bud, golden flowers bloom,
White snow descends, the sea runs deep.
This is what is meant.

The eighth month is *Guān* (观, "Contemplation)."

The ninth month opens the *Shāng* (Injury) Gate, responding to the *Sè* (Obstruction) Gate,
Positioned at *mǎo* (Tiger).
By the month’s end, the *yin* grows to eight *jīn*,
Thus, one cultivates inner fire; the small dose takes twenty-seven days.

The tenth month is *Pò* (Decay).
It opens the *Jīng* (Startle) Gate, responding to the *Shēng* (Birth) Gate,
Positioned at *chén* (Dragon).
By the month’s end, the *yin* grows to ten *jīn*,
Using fire of eight *liǎng* for three days;
The small dose, four *liǎng*, for thirty days.

The eleventh month is *Kūn* (Earth).
It opens the *Xiū* (Rest) Gate, responding to the *Jīng* (Startle) Gate,
Positioned at *sì* (Snake), where the six dragons battle in the wild,
Their blood is dark and yellow—thus the Dao is complete.
By the month’s end, the *yin* grows to one hundred ninety-two *liǎng*,
The large dose uses fire of four *liǎng* for thirty days;
The small dose also uses four *liǎng* for thirty days.

*Qián* is the Heavenly Gate; *Kūn* is the Earthly Portal—
They are the sovereigns of *yin* and *yang*!
Arising from the month of *Jiànzǐ* (Establishing-Hai),
Each month has a hexagram, accumulating to three hundred eighty-four lines.
Thus the medicine is complete.

From *zǐ* (Hai) to *sì* (Snake), pure *yang* prevails—
This is *yang* seeking *yin*, water entering metal.
From *wǔ* (Horse) to *hài* (Boar), pure *yin* prevails—
This is *yin* seeking *yang*; water congeals, metal disperses, and enters water.
Thus, water obtains fire and ascends,
Metal obtains water and hides.
This is how they mutually restrain and condense into the Great Elixir!

Examine the years, months, days, and large/small doses—
The *yang*’s growth and the measured *qi* and *liǎng*,
Like the movement of lines, opening the gates,
Following the Dipper’s monthly stations—
Life and death have their seasons; do not transgress them.

The Primordial Lord says:
This is the Dao—first expel the realm of form,
To drive out the Nine Worms.
In three days, dreams cease;
In seven days, the child’s face is renewed.

*Dao Shū* Volume Thirty-Six concludes.
*Dao Shū* Volume Thirty-Seven.

The *Dao Shū* now turns to **Master Chui’s** *Youzi’s Collection of Alchemical Secrets*—
**Chapter One of the *Yào Jìng* (Pharmaceutical Mirror)**.

Its three chapters’ marvels all center on **nurturing the spirit** (*cún shén*);
We record its words together, yet each traces its own truth.

Master Chui says:
At the **Primordial Chaos** (*hún dùn*)’s dawn, one *qi* gives birth to the **Two Principles** (*èr yí*—Yin and Yang),
And the **Two Principles** birth the **Three Powers** (*sān cái*—Heaven, Earth, and Man).
When the **Three Powers** stand, the **Five Phases** (*wǔxíng*) are complete.

The **Eight Trigrams** (*bā guà*)’s number is shared,
And the **ancestral roots** (*zǔ zōng*) dwell within the **Three Fields** (*sān tián*—Upper, Middle, Lower *Dantian*).
This is **Nature** (*xìng*).

**Nature** (*xìng*), the **Primordial Essence** (*yuán chén*) gathered—
Rejoices in movement, so outwardly it shifts with circumstance,
One birth, one death, cycling endlessly.
What may be cultivated to give life are called:
**Essence** (*jīng*), **Qi** (*qì*), **Spirit** (*shén*)—
Known as the **Three Activities** (*sān yè*), gathered to generate life.

The **Root of the Original** (*gēn yuán*) is the **Sea of *Dantian* Qi** (*dān tián qì hǎi*).
Now, the **male and female seminal fluids** (*nán nǚ jīng xuè*), when united, become one *qi*—
This *qi* is the **Primordial Qi** (*yuán qì*).
If the **Primordial Qi** does not disperse,
Then the art of **preserving it** is supreme.

With time, **purity and emptiness** (*qīng xū*) birth **spiritual radiance** (*shén guāng*).
When **spiritual radiance** flourishes,
It is the seed of **long life** (*cháng shēng*).

Now, when a person moves **restlessly** (*chōng chōng rán dòng*),
It is all **Qi**—not **Spirit**.
But when a single **true thought** (*yī niàn zhēn dìng*) is steadfast,
This is **Spirit’s inherent nature** (*shén zhī zì xìng*).
To examine this thoroughly,
One must discern **Qi** and reveal **Spirit’s true essence** (*zhēn niàn xiǎn huà tōng shén*).

How can my body differ from Heaven and Earth?
It too receives **one *qi***—no more, no less.
When **Qi** scatters, **Spirit** departs;
When **Qi** ceases, **Spirit** is still.
I will **preserve it** within the **Five Orifices** (*wǔ shū*—eyes, ears, nose, mouth, anus),
And **obtain it** through the **Five Forces** (*wǔ lì*—of the senses and internal organs).

What are the **Five Orifices** (*wǔ shū*)?
The **eyes**: their **white** belongs to the **lungs**,
Their **black** to the **kidneys**;
The **yellow** within the **black**, and its **upper and lower** edges, belong to the **spleen**;
The **emerald** within the **yellow** belongs to the **liver and gallbladder**;
The **outer corners** belong to the **heart**.

What are the **Five Forces** (*wǔ lì*)?
The **Spirit’s function** lies in the **eyes**,
While the **Five Viscera** (*wǔ zàng*) are linked to them.
It draws upon the **Lower *Dantian*’s Sea of Qi**—
This is the **root of the Five Forces**, their outward form.
Within, there are **Five Forces** too,
Taking the **Adamantine Nature** (*jīn gāng zhī xìng*)—
Within the **body’s Five Viscera** (*shēn wǔ zàng*), the **Five Phases** (*wǔ xíng*);
Within **form** (*xìng*), the **Five Colors** (*wǔ sè*);
Within **sound** (*shēng*), the **Five Tones** (*wǔ shēng*);
Within **Heaven** (*tiān*), the **Five Stars** (*wǔ xīng*);
Within **Earth** (*dì*), the **Five Sacred Mountains** (*wǔ yuè*).

To **unify the inner** (*nèi míng yī háng*) with a single **Phase**,
And **preserve it**, is to **manifest Spirit** (*shén*).
Its function lies in the **eyes**,
Its **Qi** in the **nose**—
To **still it** is the art’s perfection.

**Fire governs the South** (*nán*), its **stem-branches** (*gān zhī*) are **Bing Ding** (Fire and Earth),
And this is my **heart**.
**Water governs the North** (*běi*), its **stem-branches** are **Ren Gui** (Water and Metal),
And this is my **kidneys**.

The **heart** is the **upper Nature** (*shàng zhī xìng*), its essence lies in **suppressing the lower Fire** (*fù xià huǒ*).
If the **upper Nature**’s Fire does not flare,
Yet the **Fire** does not rise beforehand,
Then the **Water** will surely **leak** (*xiè*).

The **kidneys** are **Water**, the **Lower *Dantian*’s function** (*xià dān tián zhī yòng*).
By **fully preserving the kidneys** (*quán shēn*) to **guard the Sea of Qi** (*qì hǎi*),
The **root-source** (*gēn yuán*) is complete.
If one does not **preserve the kidney-Water** (*shǔn shén shuǐ*),
Then the **root-source** cannot be formed.

Thus, **Water** is the **flow downward** (*xià liú*),
The **common use** (*cháng rén zhī yòng*) of ordinary folk.
But **Water** is also **Essence** (*jīng*).
If one can **raise it** for **use** (*shàng yòng*),
Then the **Sages** call it **the Dao**.

The **heart** is **Spirit** (*shén*);
The **kidneys** are **Qi** (*qì*).
When **Spirit** is still and **Qi** harmonized,
The **True Person** (*zhēn rén*—the perfected immortal) descends.

Take my **heart** as the **mirror** (*jìng*),
My **body** as its **stand** (*tái*),
And **Spirit** as the **medicine** (*yào*).
Gathered, it becomes **sufficient** (*zú*).

**束** (*shù*—the liver’s *shén*) is the **east** (*dōng*), its use in the **eyes**;
**西** (*xī*—the lungs’ *qì*) is the **west** (*xī*), its use in the **nose**.
Thus, the **east and west** (*dōng xī*) are the **harmony of Spirit and Qi**,
Uniting in **returning to the source** (*huán yuán*) and **recovering the Original** (*huán jiù pò*).

When **Spirit** is insufficient and **Qi** unharmonized,
The **True Person** does not descend.

My **Spirit** and **Qi** must **struggle for inner clarity** (*yíng zhēng nèi míng*).
What is **inner clarity** (*nèi míng*)?
The **two substances** (*èr wù*—Spirit and Qi) **contending within Spirit and Qi**.

Thus, **Spirit’s radiance** (*shén guāng*) is **ever-active** (*rì yòng*),
Yet none know my **own radiance** (*jī zhī guāng*).
Hence, my **heart** is like a **mirror** (*jìng*).
Its **light** (*guāng*) **encompasses** things,
Yet things cannot **encompass the mirror’s light**—
Like the **eyes**, like the **heart**.

The **mirror’s light** is not **moving** (*dòng*),
Yet it is my **eyes** that move with things.
To know this is to **discern the *Yào Jìng*’s principle** (*lǐ*)
And how **things mutually encompass** one another.

How does the **heart-Fire** serve as the **mirror** (*jìng*)?
**Fire** is **clarity** (*míng*);
**Clarity** is **stillness** (*dìng*) and **inner clarity** (*nèi míng*).
When **inner clarity** is achieved,
All **ten thousand things** (*wàn wù*) are illuminated.

The **heart** is the **mirror’s essence** (*tǐ*);
**Clarity** is **Spirit’s function** (*yòng*).
To **daily preserve the Original** (*shǒu jiù bù lí hu shīn dì*)
Without departing from the **heart’s ground** (*xīn dì*) is **inner clarity** (*nèi míng*).
When **clarity** is achieved,
**Obscurity** (*mèi*) is overcome.

Thus, within the **heart**, **preserving the Original** is the way.
The **Three Poisons** (*sān dú*—greed, hatred, delusion),
The **Ten Evils** (*shí è*—ten unwholesome deeds),
And the **Eight Deceits** (*bā yé*—eight wrong views)
All arise from the **heart**.

The **daily eyes** (*rì mù*), **daily ears** (*rì ěr*), **daily nose** (*rì bí*)—
Called the **Six Passages** (*liù tōng*), through which **Spirit** constantly flows.
If one can **daily preserve the Original** (*rì yòng shǒu jiù*)
And **not depart from stillness** (*bù lí dìng jì*—even day and night),
Then its name is **Still Tranquility** (*dìng jì*).

**Daily preservation** (*rì yòng*) means:
**Spirit guards Qi**, gathering it without letting it scatter.
If **Spirit** can **respond universally** (*tōng yìng*),
Then wherever the **mind** (*yì*) reaches,
It will **manifest** (*chéng*).
When **Spirit** is still,
Day and night **cycle endlessly** (*zhōu*).

Thus, **Spirit abides** (*shén zhù*), **Qi abides** (*qì zhù*),
**Qi abides**, **Spirit abides** (*shén zhù*),
**Spirit abides**, **form remains** (*xíng zài*).

The **Five Phases** (*wǔ xíng*) originally have no **birth or death** (*shēng miè*).
Their **death** comes when my **Spirit and Qi** are lost.
What are the **Five Phases**?
The **true essence** (*zhēn yì*) of the **Five Viscera** (*wǔ zàng*)—
The **heart’s Spirit** (*xīn zhī shén*),
The **liver’s Hun** (*gān zhī hún*—ethereal soul),
The **lungs’ Po** (*fèi zhī pò*—corporeal soul),
The **spleen’s Yi** (*pí zhī yì*—intellect),
The **kidneys’ Zhi** (*shèn zhī zhì*—willpower),
Gathered for the **elixir’s use** (*dān zhī yòng*).

Human **Spirit** lies in **Nature** (*xìng*).
**Nature** is **Fire** (*huǒ*), which is **dispersal** (*sàn*—as in the depletion of *qi*).
The **Original** is **one catty** (*yī jīn*—a unit of weight),
Yet in **four years**, it scatters **one dram** (*sàn yī liǎng*—a small unit),
And in **forty years**, it **loses ten drams** (*wáng shí liǎng*).
By **sixty-four years**, it is **exhausted** (*jìn*).
Who can **gather it** without letting it scatter?
This is my **true Dao** (*zhēn dào*).

「All things arise from the movement of **qi** (*qì*), yet **Spirit** (*shén*) never moves. When **qi** disperses, **Spirit** does not disperse; when **qi** departs, **Spirit** does not depart. Life and death are **qi**—**Spirit** never experiences life and death.

If one can externally perceive the world while internally the **heart’s mind** (*xīn*) remains unmoved, this is the **inner response** (*nèi yìng*) of the **Law Gate** (*fǎ mén*), the **wondrous application** (*miào yòng*) of **Spirit**.

One must know that **True Suchness** (*shí xiàng*) lies beyond the realm of use or non-use, neither coming nor going. It rests in **tranquil wisdom** (*zhàn hù dìng huì*), harmonizing with the **vast emptiness** (*tài xū*) of Heaven and Earth. When **heart and Spirit** (*xīn shén*) are settled and clear, **Original Qi** (*yuán qì*) is stable and firm, and **Essence** (*jīng*) achieves longevity.

This is the **sublime efficacy** (*yào líng*) of the **Three Fields** (*sān tián*).
What are the **Three Fields**? The upper is the **brain** (*nǎo*), the middle is the **heart** (*xīn*), and the lower is the **qi sea** (*qì hǎi*), below the navel—commonly called **Three Wonders** (*sān qí*).
The **Three Wonders** are **Essence** (*jīng*), **Qi** (*qì*), and **Spirit** (*shén*).
When these three are complete, they return to the **lower elixir field** (*xià dān tián*), filling the **bone marrow** (*gǔ suǐ*).
This is the **work of transformation** (*zào huà zhī gōng*).

When **intent** (*yì*) is resolved and the body is realized, one attains the **true Dao of Immortality** (*zhēn xiān zhī dào*).

Yet, when one sees things and takes delight in letting go, this is the **heart** (*xīn*).
**Qi** is **Original Qi** (*yuán qì*).
It is obtained through **harmony** (*hé*), yet it scatters through **pleasure** (*yuè*).
Thus, when it disperses, it exits through the **gate** (*mén*); when gathered, it enters through the **gate**.
**Spirit** resides in the **eyes** (*mù*), while **Qi** is in the **nose** (*bí*).
Hence, the **eyes** are the **vulgar gate of the Diamond** (*jīn gāng zhī mén hù*)—the **Diamond** being **True Nature** (*zhēn xìng*).
**Qi** is **form-dependent** (*yīn xíng*), yet when **Spirit** is steadfast, **Qi** abides.
When **Spirit** perceives things and moves, yet the **heart** remains unmoved within, this is **inner stillness** (*nèi dìng*).
The **Diamond** is such that no external force can harm it, and it can gather **Qi** to solidify **form** (*gù xíng*).

When I have **desire** (*xǐ*), letting go causes **Spirit** to scatter, and the **Eight Evil Spirits** (*bā xié*) enter.
Thus, when the **heart** arises with duality, I cannot allow it to arise in vain—if it arises in vain, it will not be tranquil, and I will lose it.

**Essence**, **Qi**, and **Spirit** are mutually interdependent in their **substance** (*tǐ*).
How so?
**Essence** is the **ultimate source of life** (*zhì shēng zhī wù*), yet it has no **form** (*xíng*).
It relies on **Qi** to manifest **form**, yet within the body, it is **Qi**.
Beyond the **tailbone** (*wěi*), it becomes **Essence** once more.

If **Essence** can be steadfast in its **natural state** (*zì rán*), how can **form** decay?
Thus it is said: **Essence** is the **foundation of life** (*mìng*).
Those who can **prevent leakage** (*wú lòu*) are merely extending the **natural lifespan** (*tiān nián zhī shòu*).

If one follows the **principles of transformation** (*zào huà zhī lǐ*), then **True Essence** (*zhēn jīng*) is preserved, **True Form** (*zhēn xíng*) is solidified, and **True Spirit** (*zhēn shén*) is steadfast.
This is the **Dao of Longevity** (*cháng shēng zhī dào*).

Nowadays, people can steady **Essence** with the **heart**, yet cannot steady **Spirit**—they say, *"When water is full, it overflows; when Qi is full, it moves."* (*shuǐ mǎn ér yì, qì mǎn ér dòng*)

The world also knows that when **Spirit and Qi** are steadfast, they form the **Crucible** (*dǐng*).
**Spirit** arises from **Qi**, **Qi** arises from **Spirit**—if **Spirit** can guard **Qi**, then **Qi** can generate **Spirit**.
When these two guard each other, gathering to form **substance**, this is called the **Crucible**.
Thus, those who refine the **elixir** (*dān*) take from the **Original** (*běn yuán*), merging to form **substance**, returning to the **Jade Palace** (*yuán gōng*), nurturing until the **fetus** (*tāi*) forms, transforming into **True Form** (*zhēn xíng*), known as the **Shedding Immortal** (*tuì xiān*).

**Life** (*mìng*) is tied to the **Jade Balance** (*yù héng*), residing between the **Jade Cavern** (*yù dòng*) and the **lower field**.
There is a **Jade Spring** (*yù quán*) in the **lower field**, where **True Qi** (*zhēn qì*) gathers to become **Essence**.
When **True Essence’s Qi** (*zhēn jīng zhī qì*) emerges, it becomes **human form** (*wéi rén*); if it does not emerge, the **earthly root** (*dì gēn*) does not leak.
Refining it yields the **Jade Immortal** (*yù xiān*), thus preventing **leakage from the lower field** (*xià yuán bù lòu*).

One should understand how to **circulate and apply** (*yùn yòng*) this—following the **inverted flow of the Double Pass** (*niè liú yú shuāng guān*).
The **Double Pass** refers to the **two pathways** (*èr lù*) flanking the **spine** (*jiá jǐ*).
**Qi** is circulated upward to the **Upper Palace** (*shàng gōng*), which is the **brain**.
It enters the **Flower Pool** (*huā chí*), refining until it becomes **frost** (*shuāng*), reaching the **Azure Sea** (*bì hǎi*), which is the **elixir field**.
With this, **True Fire** (*zhēn huǒ*) is aroused, and through **forging** (*duàn*), it forms the **fetus of the Mysterious Pearl** (*xuán zhū zhī tāi*).
Thus, the **Mysterious Pearl** is the **True Qi** (*zhēn qì*) of the **Jade Palace**, gathering to become **Essence**, and **Essence** again forming **substance**—when the **Mysterious Pearl** is refined for long, it returns to **youth** (*cháng tóng*).
This is the **Dao of the Yellow River’s inverted flow** (*huáng hé niè liú zhī dào*), a **transcendent Dao** (*bù cháng dào*).

When the **elixir field** possesses **treasure** (*bǎo*), external matters **respond internally** (*xìng nèi*), and future events are **known beforehand** (*xiān zhī*).
Thus, **supernal and earthly harmony** (*shàng xià tōng líng*) is achieved.

The **heart** is the **seal** (*yìn*).
When the **heart** is not harmonized, the **seal** does not move.
The **heart** and the **seal** are the **root** (*gēn*).
The **seal** is **dust** (*chén*).
If one **severes the dust** (*jué chén*), one attains the **Immortal of True Emptiness** (*zhēn kōng zhī xiān*).
If the **heart** can be **removed yet not destroyed** (*chú ér bù miè*), one attains the **Immortal of Countless Emptinesses** (*shù kōng zhī xiān*).
If the **heart** and the **seal** are **neither used nor unused** (*bù yòng*), one attains the **Immortal of Void and Stillness** (*kōng jì zhī xiān*).

When the **heart** does not use the **seal**, nor the **seal** use the **heart**, the **heart** and **seal** dissolve and are extinguished in all **dust**.
The **common and the sage** (*fán shèng*) are not two—just as the **heart’s Dao** (*xīn fǎ*) is such that the **seal** never departs from the **heart**, and the two **mutually sustain** (*xiāng chí*), applying **transformative principles** (*yòng ruò zào huà*), one attains **True Yang** (*yáng zhēn*).
This is the **refinement of the elixir while preserving form** (*liú dān liú xíng*).

What is the **seal**? It is **Essence**.
When the **seal** is steadfast, **Essence** is generated; when the **seal** is severed, **Essence** is exhausted.
Thus, the **seal** arises from the **heart**, yet the **heart** is also generated from the **seal**.

Common people **use the heart** yet **do not use the seal**; sages **use the seal** yet **do not use the heart**.
If one neither uses the **heart** nor the **seal**, the **heart** will scatter recklessly.
**Scattering** means **Qi is disordered** (*qì luàn*) and **Spirit departs** (*shén qù*), while **Essence** disperses.

When the **heart** and **seal** are steadfast, and **Essence** is generated, then **Spirit** is clear and **Qi** is refreshed,
the **flesh** (*jī shū*) is radiant and **complexion** (*huá*) is lush,
the **eyes** possess **Spirit-light** (*shén guāng*),
there are **no dreams or nightmares** (*wú mèng mèi*),
**no delusions or fantasies** (*wú sāi wàng*),
**no startling or trembling** (*wú jīng jì*),
**no bewilderment or confusion** (*wú huǎng hū*).
All these are **manifestations of steadfast Essence** (*jīng dìng ér shēng*).

This **Dao** is the **return from the heart to the seal**, forming the **image of Essence**.
If one can **solidify Essence** as the **foundation of life** (*mìng jī*), then within **Essence**, **Qi** is produced to generate **Spirit**—thus forming the **fetus** and transforming into **True Form**.

What is **Essence**? It is **Spirit**.
When **Spirit** is steadfast, it generates **Essence**; when **Essence** is extreme, it generates **Spirit**—they **mutually consume** (*hù xiāng tūn*) and become **one**.
When gathered, they **generate**; when scattered, they **die**.

What is **Spirit**? It is **Qi**—also **mutually consuming**.
When **Spirit** moves, **Qi** responds; when **Qi** moves, **Spirit** returns.
When these two **mutually augment** (*xiāng chéng*), they **transform substance into pure Yang** (*huà xíng wéi chún yáng*).

The likeness of humanity follows the transformations of **Essence**.
**Essence** guards **Qi**, **Qi** guards **Spirit**, **Spirit** guards **Essence**—this is the **Way** of longevity.
When the body and mind are not greedy, nothing in the world can ensnare one—what quarrel could there be with clay?
Its name is **Retreat of the Body**.

When nothing in the world can cling to the mind, holding this as daily practice, its name is **Hiding the Spirit**.
Thus, one takes the **Three Primordials’** elixir-spirits and directs them downward to subdue **Fire**.
How does one gather the herbs?
**Spirit**, **Qi**, and **Essence**—they guard and harmonize each other.
With a single thought obtained, where do the three substances return?
They return to the **Root of Stillness**!

Where does the **Spirit-light** return?
The **Sage** returns it to the **Cinnabar Field**, while the common person returns it to **Emptiness**.
To return to the **Cinnabar Field** is to let the mind enter the intent and attain stillness, so that the **Original Spirit** sees things without moving, relying solely on inner steadiness.
But how does one preserve the dwelling of the **Spirit** when it decays?
**Master Cui** said: Thus there is the method of the **Great Elixir**.
At the **Cinnabar Field**, gather the **Three Qi** to form substance, and **Creation** produces **Spirit**; then the heart-nature wanders freely at ease.
What **Way** is this?
It is to **ride the River Vehicle** to the **Jade Gate**, offering the **Golden Essence**—
The **River Vehicle** is the **True Qi** of the North;
The **Golden Essence** is the **Kidney Chamber**.
Food enters the stomach, its dregs pass into the large intestine, its fluids into the small intestine, its **Qi** governs the **Cinnabar Field**, penetrating the **Brain Pass**, appearing at times within the **True Middle**, faintly and indistinctly#1, to irrigate the brain.
It traverses twelve paths, returning to the **Cinnabar Field**.
This is the foundation of **Returning to the Root and Reclaiming the Primordial**—the basis of life.
Thus, one opens the **Passages of the Sun and Moon**—why?
To gather the **Four Affairs**, then shake the **Heavenly Pillar**, steadying the breath, using the **Rolling Lucioperca** technique to circulate **Qi**.
This is the **Way of Rejuvenation**.
When ascending from the **Jade Pass** to the brain, entering through the **Upper Jaw**, reaching the **Nostrils**, and descending onto the tongue, its sweetness is reciprocated.
Like a **baby brother** drinking milk, it can grow to greatness—how much more so our **milk**?
During the hours of **Hai, Zi, and Chou**, one may practice **Fire**.
**Hai** is the tenth month, the **Kun** hexagram—**Kun**, the **Nurturing Mother**.
Old **Yin** reaches **Yang**, hence it is said: *"All things bear **Yin** and embrace **Yang**."*
At **Zi**, it becomes the **Fu** hexagram—
The extreme of pure **Yin**, yet giving birth to **Yang**.
This is the month of the eleventh month, when **Yin** yields to **Yang**.
I practice **Fire** at the hour of **Zi**, calling it **"Yang Born."**
From **Yin** turning to **Yang**, this is the **Half-Qi** meeting in the **Kidney Palace**.
**Chou** is the **Lin** hexagram, from its lower trigrams—**Two Yangs Born**.
**Yin** is the **Tai** hexagram, **Three Yangs** having arisen, continuing the work—this is acceptable.
**Fire** is formless, relying on **Qi** to manifest it.
Its light has **Spirit**, **Spirit** borrows from **Nature**, and **Nature** can transform—thus, **Spirit** is **Fire**.
It cannot be seen on its own; like fire in wood, it must be kindled to burn.
What is the method of kindling?
Close the eyes, sit upright, steady the breath, and calm the mind—
Thus, when **Spirit** is steadfast and **Qi** harmonized, the heart attains it, and **Fire** arises.
**True Fire** can refine the **Cinnabar**; do not act without principle.

During the hours of **Si, Wu, and Wei**, one may practice **Water**.
**Si** is the fourth month, the **Qian** hexagram—**Yang** at its peak, **Yin** arising;
**Wu** is the fifth month, the **Yun** hexagram—**One Yin** born;
**Wei** is the sixth month, the **Tuan** hexagram—**Two Yins** born;
**Shen** is the seventh month, the **Pi** hexagram—**Three Yins** born.
These three hexagrams are when one may practice **Water**.
Acting in accordance with the season, **Water** will naturally arise from the heart—why?
The heart is the **Root**.
If one remains serene and unmoving, the breath ceases and **Spirit** steadies, then **Water** will also arise from the **Kidney Chamber**.
Ascending to the brain and **Upper Jaw**, descending into the mouth, its taste is sweet.
With the heart’s **Water** ascending to the tongue, stirring it in the **Hua Pool** left and right, eighteen times each;
Rinsing and swirling in the mouth, thirty-six times, or without counting, standing straight and upright, divided into three, using force to swallow.
Thus, drinking **Qi** and swallowing it, sending it with **Spirit** to the **Cinnabar Field**’s left and right, bathing and irrigating—
Then the **Numinous Source** sprouts, and only then can the **Great Work** be accomplished.
For those practicing **Water**, the number twelve is used—each swallow divided into thirty-six.
Six times six is thirty-six, the number of **Water**’s cycles.
During the hours of **Yin, Shen, Mao, and You**, one may **Nurture the Spirit**.
What is this **Way**?

「Ever maintain the old **Way**,
With not a single thought straying, **Nurture the Qi** and **subdue the Essence**,
**Guard the Spirit** and **stabilize the Breath**,
Act in response to things, but do not chase after external **Realms**—
This is the **Way** of the **True Person**.

I take the **symbols** of sun and moon as **models**,
Yet prefer the **model** of the moon’s course to that of the year,
The **model** of the sun’s course to that of the moon,
And the **model** of the times’ course to that of the sun.
For the **model** of the times can **overcome** the sun’s **power**,
The **model** of the sun can **overcome** the moon’s **power**,
And the **model** of the moon can **overcome** the year’s **power**.
When I follow the **model** of the times,
The **True Person** comes to assist me.

With **inner** and **outer** **powers** practiced,
Mutually aiding for a thousand days,
There will be no **deficiency** in achieving the **True Person**’s **state**.
The **True Person** is one who attains **mixed** **dharma** and **fruit** as a **minor** **immortal**—
Yet without understanding the **method** of **refining the Elixir**,
One merely **abides in stillness** and **guards the old**,
Though perhaps the **madness of Yang** may be tempered,
At death, the **Spirit** departs—
This is but a **ghost**!

The **Spirit** is the **host**,
The **guest** does not dare to be the **host**,
Only the **guest**;
It does not dare to advance,
Only seeks to retreat.
In daily life,
It does not contend with things,
As if dwelling within beloved objects,
The **Spirit** ever remains as **guest**,
Guarding its **root foundation**.

If one **sees things** and **loves them** with the **Spirit**,
Using them as the **host** and binding to them,
Then the **eyes**, **ears**, **nose**, and **tongue**,
Within them, the **Six Emotions** arise—
Thus, the **True Self** is lost.

Therefore, those who **cultivate the True**,
Ever **guard the Spirit** in the **Cinnabar Field** and the **root of life**.
This has no other **method**—
When the **Spirit** is **harmonized**, it **guards the Qi**,
The **Qi** thus **guards the Essence**,
The **Essence** thus **guards the One**,
It does not dare to be the **host**.
This is **inner** and **outer** **Spirit** **stability**,
Thus there is no **arising** or **perishing**.

The **person** relies on **Essence** to obtain **Spirit**,
The **Spirit** relies on **thought** to obtain **life**—
Thus, **life** resides in **Essence**.
**Essence** is the **supreme True**,
The **origin** of all things,
That which has **name** but no **form**.

The heavens and earth, ten thousand things,
All are born from **Essence**,
And **accumulated** as **life**—
Its source lies in the **vague** and **dim**.

Master Cui said:
*The heavens and earth give birth to the **Eight Trigrams**,
The **Eight Trigrams** give birth to the **Ten Heavenly Stems**.
Thus, **Jia** gives birth to **Qian**,
**Yi** gives birth to **Kun**,
**Bing** gives birth to **Gen**,
**Ding** gives birth to **Dui**,
**Geng** gives birth to **Zhen**,
**Xin** gives birth to **Xun**,
**Ren** gives birth to **Li**,
**Gui** gives birth to **Kan**,
And **Wu** and **Ji** serve as their **complements**,
The **Central Palace** thus formed.

The heavens have **three wonders**: the **sun**, the **moon**, and the **stars**;
The earth has **three wonders**: **Yi**, **Bing**, and **Ding**;
Humans have **three wonders**: **Essence**, **Qi**, and **Spirit**.

The heavens’ **wandering celestial sphere**,
The earth’s **Yellow River**,
And the human’s **Nourishing and Defensive Circuits**—
These are the **manifestations** of the **three wonders**.

If my **three wonders** do not depart from the **body**,
Inheriting the heavens and earth while **circulating** and **transforming**,
I shall be **equal** to the heavens and earth.

**Water**, **Fire**, **Metal**, and **Wood** are **few**,
The **Four Seasons** are **long-lasting**—
This is the **principle** of **longevity**.

If one **inherits** this **principle**,
Then **life** can be **endless**.
Why?
The **East** is **Jia** and **Yi**—
**Jia** is **Qian**, **Yi** is **Kun**,
They are **husband** and **wife**.
The **South** is **Bing** and **Ding**—
**Bing** is **Gen**, **Ding** is **Dui**,
They are **husband** and **wife**.
The **West** is **Geng** and **Xin**—
**Geng** is **Zhen**, **Xin** is **Xun**,
They are **husband** and **wife**.
The **North** is **Ren** and **Gui**—
**Ren** is **Li**, **Gui** is **Kan**,
They are **husband** and **wife**.

**Zhen** corresponds to the **liver**,
**Dui** to the **lungs**,
**Li** to the **heart**,
**Kan** to the **kidneys**,
And **Kun** to the **spleen**.
When the **Four Seasons** enter as **medicines** into the **Cinnabar Field**,
This is how one **equals** the heavens and earth in **longevity**!

The human **Spirit** is like **fire** in **kindling**?
Within it, **fire** is **hidden**—
If the **fire** does not **emerge**, the **kindling** remains **long-lasting**,
If the **Spirit** does not **emerge**, the **body** remains **long-lasting**.

Thus, when **fire** **flares** and **illuminates** externally,
The **kindling** is **exhausted**;
When the **Spirit**’s **awareness** **emerges**,
The **primordial purity** is **scattered**.
If the **Spirit’s light** does not **scatter**,
And the **Spirit** **responds** to things without **emerging**,
It is **solid** and **complete**, preserving the **True Self**.

**Essence** is the **supreme True**.
When **Essence** **interacts** with **Spirit** and **Qi**,
It can **solidify** the **form**.
Let the **Spirit** **nourish** the **inner**,
Use the **Qi** to **nourish** the **outer**,
Rely on the **refined Essence** within to **balance** and **harmonize**,
Thus one attains **longevity**.

The **Spirit’s light** is the **hidden** within the **Qi**.
**Essence** is the **light**,
**Spirit** is the **wisdom**,
**Qi** is the **cauldron**—
These are the **so-called Three Treasures**!

The **Spirit** must not **depart** from the **body**,
The **Essence** must not **depart** from the **Spirit**,
The **Qi** **envelops** the **Three Treasures**—
Thus it **unites** with the **Three Realms**.

Master Guangchengzi said:
**Essence** is born between the **Sea of Qi**,
Like **fire** within **wood**.
My **Jade Spring** is akin to the **wandering celestial sphere** and the **Yellow River**.
The **Kun** **Trigram** and the **Fight Star’s** hour—
This is **Hai**.
Does it **transform** at **Zi**?
The **Fu** **Trigram** is **upper earth, lower wood**.
**Wood** is the **binding** **direction** among the **Five Phases**.
The **Lianzhen Star** corresponds to the **Five Phases** as **fire**.

**Fire** within **water**—
**Water** is its **form**, while **fire** is **formless**.
The **flow** of **Jade Spring** ascending—
This is **fire** within **water**.

**Symbolizing** **Kun** as **Fu**,
One **Yang** is born—
Thus, the **ten months** proceed in **order**,
Until the **eleventh month**—
This is **natural**.

All hours of **Zi** are the same.
**Zi** proceeds for **nine double-hours**,
Opening the **Passage** above and letting the **flow** descend,
The **Jade Spring** comes down—
This is **refining the form** with **golden liquid**.

When the **Five Phases** enter as **medicines**,
They are **fire**, **metal**, and **wood**,
**Combining** with the **trigrams** to **operate**.

When **Spirit** and **Essence** **merge** with the **symbols**,
They never **depart** from the **Sea of Qi**,
The **Essence** follows its **Spirit**,
And is **cast** into the **Sea of Qi**—
Thus the **cauldron** is **formed**.

When **Spirit** and **Qi** are **closed** and **retained**,
The **Qi** **attains longevity**.
When the **Qi** **expands**, the **Essence** ascends—
This is **the utmost marvel**.

The **Spirit** **responds** to the **Qi** and **follows** it—
This is called **fire**;
The **Essence** **responds** to the **Qi** and **follows** it—
This is called **water**.

When I **administer medicines**,
The **Qi** of the **Heavenly Gate** does not **emerge**,
Soft and lingering, as if **retained**—
Thus the **Qi** does not **depart** the **body**,
The **Spirit** and **Essence** **circulate** naturally,
Like the **heavenly fire** and **earthly water**,
With **water** below **fire**,
And **fire** below **Qi**.»

「This is the natural progression of the Five Phases. The seven upper orifices are the **Seven Celestial Officials**; the two lower orifices are the **Ministerial Stars**. This mirrors the movements of **Heaven and Earth**.

**Kunlun** is the **crown**; **Tianzhu** are the **twenty-four vertebrae** along the spine. Turning and moving the head left and right causes the **hundred vessels** to flow freely.

Opening the two **passes** means raising both hands. Lifting and lowering the body, as if bowing repeatedly, opens the orifices and allows the flow to enter the **Upper Palace**—the **brain**. Those who practice the **Dao** must follow their nature: close when closed, sleep when asleep, move when moving, yet their nature must not be **agitated**.

Always guarding the **Spirit** at the **Elixir Field**, one must guard it as if not guarding—this is the **true造化 (zàohuà)**.

- **乾六 (Qián liù)**, the **Large Intestine**; **坎一 (Kǎn yī)**, the **Kidneys**; **艮八 (Gèn bā)**, the **Bladder**; **震三 (Zhèn sān)**, the **Liver**; **巽四 (Xùn sì)**, the **Gallbladder**; **离九 (Lí jiǔ)**, the **Heart**; **坤二 (Kūn èr)**, the **Small Intestine**; **兑七 (Duì qī)**, the **Lungs and Spleen**; **土 (Tǔ)**, the **Central Palace’s Fire** and the source where **Earthly Metal** arises from **Water**. **Wood** arises from **Metal** within **Water**, **Water** from **Fire** within **Earth**, but only **Earth** harmonizes with the four **seasons’** transitions and dwells in the **Central Palace**.

---
**Chapter on Alchemical Refining in the *People’s Pharmacy* (人药镜中篇) says:**

I have obtained two works from **Master Cui (崔公)**. Both speak of **Original Qi (元气)**, which is **lead and mercury (铅汞)**. Refining it through **nine revolutions (九转)**, one attains **transcendence (成仙)**.

The first asks: **"Refining Refining (采药者)**, what is it?"**
When the **Dragon and Tiger** surge and **soar**, the **sun and moon** take flight.
The **Nine Curves (九曲)** are the **ancestral source of True Essence**, capable of distinguishing the **Two Polarities (二仪)**.
What are the **Nine Curves**?
They are the **Small Intestine (小肠)**.
The **Two Polarities (二仪)** are the **sun and moon**, the **True Mercury and Lead (真汞铅)**.
The **root of the Great Medicine (大药)** lies within them.

The second asks: **"Wood Mercury, Metal Lead (木汞金铅)**, what is it?"**
The **Original Qi of the Two Eights (二八之元)**—the **Essence of the Sun and Moon**—arises from **One Water (一水)**.
If I **extract and supplement (抽添)** at the **Two Eights’ Gate** without error,
Then the **Medicine Sea** reveals its **True Essence**, and the **Sun’s Radiance** descends.
Thus, refining it for **a thousand days (千日)**, it attains the form of **gold and jade (金玉之形)**.

The third asks: **"Refining the Supreme Medicine (至药抽添)**, what is it?"**
I **extract and supplement (抽添)** at the **two crescents of the Sun and Moon (日月二弦)**.
Using the **Red Dragon Fire Chariot (赤龙火车)** to refine it at these **two times (二时)**,
Then the **Perverse Wind (巽风)** arises, and the **stars align (星辰列)**.
These are the **two times (二时)**.

The **Fire Chariot (火车)** is the **symbol of Yang (阳)**.

The fourth asks: **"Dragon and Tiger: Lead and Mercury (龙虎铅汞)**, what is it?"**
The **Dragon extracts its mercury (抽其汞)**, the **Tiger supplements its lead (添其铅)**,
Floating and sinking within the **cauldron (鼎)**—both substances are complete.
Then I **combine with 坎戊 (Kǎn wù)** and **unify with 离己 (Lí jǐ)**.
I have **mastered the two moments of Yin-Yang Ascension and Descension (阴阳升降之二时)** to **activate the alchemical process (兴功)**,
Without losing even a **dram of weight (铢两)**,
Only then can the **Great Medicine (大药)** be formed.

The fifth asks: **"Seeking the Yang Crow (阳乌) at the Sea’s Depth (海底)**, what is it?"**
When it **flaps its wings (振羽)** at the **Sea** and **charges forward (奔冲)**,
Do not let the **Fire Spirit (火神)** take flight.
For if **Fire** mingles with the **Elixir Field (丹阙)**, it **extinguishes the Fire**.
By the time of **#2 Bathing in the Sun’s Radiance (沐浴之日)**, one can use **Yang Fire (阳火)**.
Taking **eight *liǎng* (两) of gold sand (金砂)**, this is called **True Yang (真阳)**.
This is the **pivotal moment of Reversion Elixir (还丹)**.

Then **Emerald Waves and Golden Tides (碧浪金波)** pour into **坎男 (Kǎn nán)**,
And the sixth asks: **"The Celestial Symbol (符星) enters the Primordial Palace (元宫)**, what is it?"**
The **Celestial Symbol** revolves and enters the **Primordial Palace (元胎之宫)**,
To **control the redness of the Lead Frost (制铅霜之红)**,
This is the **Qi of the Returning Elixir (金丹返)** and the **Celestial Symbol’s True Essence (天符还真)**.
Within the **cauldron**, **silver fluid (银液)** naturally forms—
Its appearance is like **water lilies (芙蓉)**.

The seventh asks: **"Fire attains Pure Yang (纯阳)**, what is it?"**
The **Pure Intestine (纯肠)** is **乾 (Qián)**.
When the **Gold Elixir (金丹)** reaches **seven returns (七返)**,
Then **Yang Qi (阳气)** surpasses the **sixth phase (六)**,
And **Regulating Qi (庚之气)** restrains it—
Thus **Autumn Stone (秋石)** becomes **琅牙 (Láng yá)**,
And **Lead Frost (铅霜)** solidifies into **Returning Elixir (返丹)**.
If **harmonized properly (合和有道)**,
Then the **Qi of the Nine Revolutions (九转阵和)** appears.

The eighth asks: **"Yin-Yang Restraint and Control (阴阳拘制)**, what is it?"**
There is a **Mysterious Pass (玄关)** for restraint and control.
When **Fire** reaches the **Southern Realm (南方)**, it ceases refining.
In the **坤 (Kūn) cauldron**, **Yang is restrained by Yin (阳为阴所制)**—
Its **lead (铅)** becomes **white snow (白雪)**,
Its form like **peach blossoms (桃华)**.
Refining it until **ninety-nine (九九)**,
Then **lead and mercury (铅汞)** are **settled at the Elixir Field (镇於丹田)**,
And can **overcome cold and heat (胜寒暑)**.
This is the **Iron Ox’s Clockwork Gold Coin (铁牛之锺金钱)**.

The ninth asks: **"The Galloping Elixir’s Auspicious Qi (奔腾瑞气)**, what is it?"**
Its **Qi** is **settled at the 坤宫 (Kūn Palace)**,
And the **Rainbow Chariot (霓车)** follows the **wind** in **reverse revolution (逆转)**.
Thus, the **root of the Sun and Moon (日月之根)** is obtained,
And the **yellow sprout (黄芽)** matures into **jade (玉)**—
The **Gold Elixir’s Yang nature (金丹阳质)**—
This is the **transformation of the Primordial Embryo (换胎)**.
With **Great Dao’s profound foundation (大道玄基)**, through **frequent refining by Fire (火频炼)**,
One **enters transcendence (入於仙)**.

The tenth asks: **"Tiger Crouching, Dragon Sharpening (虎踞龙铨)**, what is it?"**
It is the **crocodile that chases the Dipper (逐斗之鳄)**.
When **乾 (Qián)** and **坤 (Kūn)** **settle their positions (定位)** and reach the **lower crescent (下弦)**,
Then the **Qi within the cauldron intensifies (鼎之中生气加)**.
**Maid and Infant (姥女、婴儿)**—
Their **consumption of cinnabar (服绛销)**—
This is the **Gold Elixir’s child and parent (子母相成)**,
Where **Yin and Yang** **bind and do not disperse (结而不散)**.
Taking it for **a thousand days (千日)**, one **reverts to youthful appearance (返童颜)**.

The eleventh asks: **"The Nine Qi’s Complete Surge (九气冲全)**, what is it?"**
When **Qi surges fully (冲全)**, it **multiplies a hundredfold (百倍)**.
**Haze-light (霞光)** shines upon the **Divine Furnace (神炉)**,
And the **Yellow Grandmother’s (黄婆)** heart **settles (定)**,
While **male and female bathe in the cinnabar pearl (浴於绛珠)**.
This is the **Nine Revolutions** forming the **Mysterious Pearl (玄珠)**;
Taking it **once and refining it once (服之一圆)**,
One’s **lifespan reaches ten thousand years (寿千龄)**;
Taking it **twice and refining it twice (再服再炼)**,
Then **longevity and eternal vision (长生久视)** are attained.

The twelfth asks: **"The Jade Emperor’s Newly Sealed Supreme Position (玉帝新封剧位)**, what is it?"**
Refining it to **achieve 坎离 (Kǎn lí)**,
Then **Spirit-light (神光)** naturally **enters and exits (出入)**,
Hidden and revealed **clearly (隐显分明)**,
**Yang Spirit (阳神)** grows daily,
**Yin evils (阴邪)** fade daily—
Thus **longevity (长生)** is attained.
This is the **Jade Emperor’s seal upon the Supreme Unity (太一之君)**.

The thirteenth asks: **"The Nine-Year Tortoise Elixir (九年丹鳌)**, what is it?"**
After **nine years (九年)**, one **grasps Heaven’s Mechanism (得乎天机)**,
And **gallops ten thousand *lǐ* (万里)** without **erring (迷)**.
Refining it for **a thousand days (千日)**,
Then one **ascends in spirit (羽化)**.»

「The fourteenth asks: **"Extinction and Annihilation (灭没)**," what is it?
It is when my **cultivation (兴功)** encounters the **two phases of the moon (日月二弦)**, where there is **harm without benefit (有损无益)**.
Thus, the **cultivator (修炼者)** **perishes in extinction (灭没)**.
Hence it is said: **"The Dao (道) ceases when Yin and Yang’s phases converge (阴阳停泽二弦乎矣)**.
When the **two phases of annihilation (二没)** intersect, **extinction and annihilation (灭没)** occur together.
At this point, one **gathers and refines (会聚而炼之)**, and only then does **True Essence (真)** manifest.

The fifteenth asks: **"Gathering the Medicine (采药)**," what is it?
One **collects the metals (收金)** and **harvests the jade (采玉)**, borrowing **from Heaven’s Dao (藉乎天)**.
The **Primordial Yang Fire (元阳火)** and **True Qi (真气)** are combined and refined.
When the **weight of a *qian* or *liang* (铢两)** is sufficient,
Then **the Dragon moves and rain falls (龙行雨过)**,
And one **enters the Kun Spring (昆源)**.
**Yin True Lord (阴真君)** says:
*"There are times to gather (采有日), there are seasons to take (取有时者也)."*

The sixteenth asks: **"The Dao Knife and Rectangular Tablet (刀圭)**," what is it?
It is the **essence of the sun and moon (日月之精)**, the **True Qi (真气)**.
The **two principles of Yin and Yang (阴阳之二)**, with **Earth governing the birth of myriad things (土主生万物)**,
Are called **the Dao Knife (刀圭)**, hidden within the **cauldron of the Spleen (脾之鼎)**.
When it encounters the **division of the two Qi (二气分)**, **transformation (变化)** occurs.
Later, **Pure Yang Master (纯阳子) Lü Dongbin (吕洞宾)** once heard this from **Master Cui (崔公)** and sighed:
*"I now understand that **cultivation (修行)** has its foundation,
And that **life and nature (性命)** have no disparity—
The **Dao (道)** is achieved within this.
Thus, **Pure Yang Master (纯阳子)** further expounded and elucidated it.
**Pure Yang Master (纯阳子)** said:
*"In ancient times, the **Yellow Emperor (黄帝)** traveled throughout the four directions,
And reached the **Qingcheng Mountains (青城之山)**.
There he met **Qiběi (岐伯)**, **Guǎngchéngzi (广成子)**, and **Huánggǔzi (黄谷子)**,
And thus **illuminated the Great Dao (明大道)**.
Then he **mastered the Hundred Measures Method (究百刻之法)**,
Harvesting **gold, lead, jade, and cinnabar (金铅玉汞)**—the **Three Primordials (三元)**—
And **applying fire (下火)** to **concoct them (以烹之)**.
Within the **Hundred Measures (百刻)**, he **perfected the transformations of nature (为造化)**,
And only then did the **#3 embryo of the Rabbit (胎兔)** naturally form.
Indeed, the **Hundred Measures (百刻)** **settle the breath into one measure (定其息一刻)**.

**The Treatise on the Gathering of the True:**

The *Zhanghuang Afu Jing* (Imperial Mysteries of the Hidden Sovereign) proclaims the mighty words of the Dao,
Illuminating the path from past to future—
The gateway to entering the Way.

Huayangzi, Shi Jianwu, said:
Water, fire, metal, wood, and earth—these are the Five Phases.
They generate one another as mother and child,
They restrain one another as husband and wife—
This, all the world knows.

Yet few grasp the inverted laws,
Few perceive the principles of extraction and augmentation.

The Three Fields—Upper, Middle, Lower—
Of essence, qi, and spirit—
This, all the world knows.

Yet few attain the meaning of reversal,
Few witness the power of transcendence.

Only by mastering the inversion of the Five Phases
Can one enter the Way.
Only by knowing extraction and augmentation
Does one become a true adept.

Only by attaining the reversal of the Three Fields
Can one obtain the Way.
Only by reaching the transcendence of the Dao
Does one become a perfected sage.

I have observed those who attained the Way and transcended—
No more than ten or so in the Western Mountains.

Their essentials are twenty-five in number:
**Recognizing the Dao,**
**Recognizing the Method,**
**Recognizing humanity,**
**Recognizing the times,**
**Recognizing things,**
**Nurturing life,**
**Nurturing form,**
**Nurturing qi**—
**Twice, nurturing the heart,**
**Nurturing longevity,**
**Supplementing the inner,**
**Supplementing essence,**
**Supplementing qi,**
**Supplementing and benefiting,**
**Supplementing and diminishing,**
**True Water and Fire,**
**True Dragon and Tiger,**
**True elixir medicines,**
**True lead and mercury,**
**True yin and yang,**
**Refining the Method to enter the Way,**
**Refining form to transform qi,**
**Refining qi to become spirit,**
**Refining spirit to merge with the Dao,**
**Refining the Dao to attain sainthood.**

Ge Xian Gong said:
Buddhist monks are mired in stubborn emptiness,
Scholars cling to the present moment,
Unknowing that the ancient sages’ Way resides in the single mind.

Pure Yangzi understood this truth,
Thus he favored the School of Nature,
Cultivated the celestial rank,
And abandoned human rank;
He scorned stubborn emptiness
And awakened to True Emptiness.

This is why one must **recognize the Dao.**

**The Supreme Hidden Scripture says:**

Three thousand six hundred methods exist, yet only a few dozen nourish life.
The three thousand six hundred are for a decade’s span.
The few dozen are:
**Heaven One, Earth Two, Heaven Three, Earth Four,**
**Heaven Five, Earth Six, Heaven Seven, Earth Eight,**
**Heaven Nine, Earth Ten**—
the numbers of the Five Phases and yin-yang.

In ancient times, **Hua Tuo**#1 said that prolonged inactivity causes *qi* to stagnate and blood to congeal, so he observed the playful movements of the five animals and created *dao yin* to make the *honor* and *defense* circulate freely. Later practitioners mistakenly named this *bo yun*—a misstep.

In ancient times, **Chen Yi** entrusted his daughter to the Dao, imitating the turtle’s inhaling and exhaling, enduring a year of starvation without dying. Later practitioners mistakenly called this *fu qi* and sought elixirs—a misstep.

**Zhang Shao** said the five flavors disrupt true fluids; if one organ flourishes, another decays; if one *qi* thrives, another weakens. Thus, he abandoned the five flavors. Later practitioners mistakenly called this *xiuliang*—a misstep.

**Liu Dong** understood true yang and true yin—if in excess, he drew it inward; if deficient, he expelled its specter, supplementing and draining as needed. Later practitioners mistakenly adopted *cai ri jing yue hua* and sought the pure *qi* of Heaven and Earth—a misstep.

**Rong Chengzi** taught **Huangdi** the *fangzhong* arts, fearing he might dissipate true *qi* and neglect proper cultivation. Thus, he restrained him within the realm of desire alone—unknowing that sexual vigor consumes *qi*. Later practitioners mistakenly called this *yinren bu ren*—a misstep.

**Huangdi** cultivated at **Kongtong** but achieved no success.
**Guang Chengzi** taught external alchemy to replenish the depletion of accumulated yang. Later practitioners mistakenly sought to ingest lifeless metals and stones—a misstep.

**Pian Que** expounded the *Ling Shu*, saying:
Draw clean *qi* through the nose, expel turbid *qi* through the mouth, retain it for twenty-four breaths—this is one *liang* of fire. Use it to refine true lead like a *xie rui* flower, calling it the **Yang Embryo**; refine true mercury like a lotus in bloom, calling it the **Yin Embryo**.
When the embryo dwells in the breath, the breath stills, and the spirit remains. Accumulate thus to attain sainthood.
Later practitioners mistakenly called this *duo ru shao chu* as a method of breath retention, gathering *qi* into an embryo—a misstep.

The *Nine Immortal Scripture* says:
For grave illness, use fire; for minor illness, use water.
Using fire: inhale *qi* and let it ascend the body, spreading true *qi* through the Four Great Elements to repel yin evils.
Using water: inhale *qi* and let it ascend the body, making it surge like a gushing spring. Settle the mind and will the *qi* to the site of illness, then the *qi* and blood will flow freely without obstruction.
Later practitioners mistakenly closed the breath with the tongue as a pivot, rotating left and right, collecting residual saliva, rinsing and swallowing it, then transmitting it externally through the intestines and stomach, calling it *jiao zhuo* to nurture the yellow shoot—a misstep.

The *Communion with the Mysterious Scripture* says:
Hold to the Way of *wuwei*, attaining the principle of spontaneity—clear yet not turbid, still yet not motionless.
Later practitioners mistakenly clung to extreme stillness—a misstep.

The *Soul Treasury of the Numinous Treasure Scripture* says:
Exclude external phenomena, suppress internal distractions, close the eyes and gaze inward, lower the sovereign fire to the lower field, spread the yellow clouds through the Four Great Elements, and let the *sheng huang* carriages and attendants process to and fro.
Later practitioners became like withered wood and dead ashes, lost in torpor and dimness, with yin spirits escaping through the heavenly gate, only to return to rebirth—a misstep.

Thus arose further errors:
Opening the crown to shrink the tortoise, dwelling in mountains to recognize nature, burning incense, chanting scriptures, making offerings—all futile.

Yet one must know one’s own water and fire:
Fire contains water, water contains fire;
Fire bears yin above, vague and indistinct—this is the true One Water;
Water embraces yang below, obscure and murky—this is the pure Yang *qi*.
This is why one must **recognize the Method**.

The Daoist seeker must have a teacher.
**Zhang Menggan** met **Hai Chanzi** three times and attained three stages of the Way;
**Jie Zhi** met **Xu Jingyang** once and was granted the nine transformations;
**Wang Meng** met the **Great Longevity Immortal** and recognized the Great Dao;
**Mei Fu** encountered the **Great Cavern True Immortal** and exhausted Heaven’s designs.

Yet teachers may conceal themselves in silence or appear lacking in virtue.
**Huangdi** sought **Chi Songzi** for half a year, gaining only the *Zhong Jie Scripture* to guard against external loss;
**Liu An** followed **Wang Dao Hou** for a year, obtaining only a minor method, insufficient for cultivation, so he achieved only prolonged life. **Ma Ming** did not cease his studies despite his chronic illness, while **Ge Zhi Chuan** did not teach others despite possessing **Zheng Si Yuan’s** methods.

Thus, how difficult it is to **recognize the teacher**!
Some speak eloquently yet are tongue-tied;
Some excel in rhetoric yet lack depth;
Some affect ancient mien but are insincere;
Some are pure in essence yet flawed in detail;
Some appear foolish yet become sages in the end.
This is why one must **recognize people**.

Ancient perfected ones, before refining and transforming, first cultivated and nourished.
Ordinary bathing cannot compare to true bathing—what is this?
In a secluded chamber, still room, close the eyes and quiet the mind, sit upright to let the primal *qi* ascend, filling the Four Great Elements, entering the **muddy pellet**.
This is true bathing—
far surpassing external water and fire!
It aligns with the proper ascent and descent of yin-yang, the monthly cycles of the moon.

Spring brings growth, summer lengthens—yet plum blossoms and chrysanthemums flourish;
Autumn harvests, winter stores—yet cypress bears fruit and pine thrives.
If humans cannot cultivate true nature to refine the form, they shame the grasses and trees.

The crane knows the midnight hour, transforming yin into yang.
The swallow recognizes that *wu* and *ji* belong to water, avoiding earth;
The snake avoids the *si* day’s path;
The oriole emerges from its nest in spring—

「If humans cannot nurture the primal *yang* to store the true *qi*, they shame the birds and beasts. The unknowing waste their eight hundred and ten *zhang* of primal *qi*, yet fail to recognize that its *qi* manifests in spring at the liver, in summer at the heart, in autumn at the lungs, and in winter at the kidneys.

This is the great cycle that follows the heavens. The child hour (*zi*) belongs to the kidneys, the morning hour (*coi*) to the liver, the noon hour (*wu*) to the heart, and the evening hour (*you*) to the lungs—this is the lesser cycle that follows the sun.

The spring, summer, autumn, and winter of heaven and earth, the waxing and waning of the moon’s phases, the child, noon, morning, and evening hours of humanity—these all correspond. The days and months of heaven and earth, the days of the moon, the hours of the sun, and the degrees of humanity, are named as three hundred and sixty.

The *qi* of heaven and earth, the degrees of the sun and moon, and the hours of humanity—each has twenty-four, and these too are in harmony.

From the child hour to noon, when *qi* is generated, is *yang*; from noon to the child hour, when *qi* wanes, is yin. The hours of *zi* (child), *chén* (hour of the snake), *wu* (noon), *shēn* (hour of the monkey), *yǒu* (evening), *xū* (hour of the dog), *jiǎ* (first hour of the day), *bǐng* (third hour), *wù* (fifth hour), *gēng* (seventh hour), and *rén* (ninth hour) are the hours of *yang*; the hours of *mǎo* (morning), *wèi* (hour of the rabbit), *wǔ* (noon), *yǒu* (evening), *hài* (last hour), *chǒu* (second hour), *yí* (second hour of the day), *dīng* (fourth hour), *jǐ* (sixth hour), *xīn* (eighth hour), and *guǐ* (tenth hour) are the hours of yin.

*Chén* is the Greater *yang*, *mǎo* is Bright *yang*, *yǐ* is Lesser *yang*, *chǒu* is Greater yin, *zi* is Lesser yin, and *hài* is Reversed yin. *Xū* is Greater *yang*, *yǒu* is Bright *yang*, *shēn* is Lesser *yang*, *wǔ* is Greater yin, *wu* is Lesser yin, and *wèi* is Reversed yin.

Thus, at noon (*wu*), the *qi* of the kidneys and the *qi* of the heart intersect, ascending from below to above—this is the time when the three *yang* converge. At the child hour (*zi*), the *qi* of the heart and the kidneys intersect, descending from above to below—this is the time when the three yin converge.

The *hun* (ethereal soul) is *yang* within yin, its *qi* arising at the beginning of the morning hour (*mǎo*). The *pò* (corporeal soul) is yin within *yang*, its *qi* arising at the end of the evening hour (*yǒu*).

To nurture *yang* is not merely in spring and summer; rather, one must tend to its *qi* in the heart and liver. To nurture yin is not merely in autumn and winter; rather, one must tend to its *qi* in the kidneys and lungs.

After the summer solstice, true *mercury* (spirit of the heart) accumulates in the *Jing Palace* (vermilion chamber); after the winter solstice, true *lead* (spirit of the kidneys) accumulates in the *Dan Tian* (elixir field).

The Wood cycle converges at *Tian Wu* (heavenly mist), twenty-five degrees—this is *Xun* (gentle wind). When *yang* meets *yang*, at this juncture, one should gather it to form the Great Elixir.

The Metal cycle converges at *Ling Fu* (spiritual symbol), twenty-five degrees—this is *Qian* (metal). When yin meets yin, at this juncture, one should refine it into the Returning Elixir.

Thus, igniting fire to refine the form occurs before the *qi* ascends; gathering the Fire cycle is done at the moment of yin’s descent.

If one refines the form to dwell in the mortal world, then *qi* takes precedence, using the moments when the Five Phases (elements) mutually restrain. If one refines the *qi* to transcend the mundane, then timing is paramount, relying on the return of the Three Fields (triple burner) to their proper states. Those who see no progress are either failing to gather at the right time, to supplement when deficient, to consolidate when scattered, to seize when the moment is ripe, to seek without proper occasion, or to refine when the time is not yet returned.

This is why one must not fail to recognize the proper times.

Master Zheng Yang (*Zi*) says: The heart is heaven; the kidneys are earth; the lungs are the moon; the liver is the sun.

Master Cui Xuan Zhen says: The *qi* of the kidneys is the infant; the fluid of the heart is the elderly woman; the *qi* of the liver is *yang* within yin—this is the ethereal soul of the sun; the *qi* of the lungs is yin within *yang*—this is the corporeal soul of the moon.

What are the Four Symbols? The heart is the *Zhu Que* (Vermilion Bird); the kidneys are the *Xuan Wu* (Dark Tortoise); the liver is the *Qing Long* (Azure Dragon); the lungs are the *Bai Hu* (White Tiger).

Master Ge Xian Gong says: The infant is the *qi* above the heart’s fluid, the proper *yang* essence; the elderly woman is the *qi* within the kidneys, the true One’s water. The Golden Sage is the aged *yang* of the lungs; when its *yang* is weak, it must be restored to the lower elixir field. The remaining fluid is aged yin.

The kidneys’ *qi* reaches the spleen’s fluid—this is true yin approaching Lesser yin, its yin weak and declining, and must be restored to the lower elixir field. This too is among the Four Symbols.

Master Tai Bai Zhen Ren says: The Five Phases inversion technique—why does the Dragon emerge from within fire, when the Five Phases do not proceed in their proper order? Why does the Tiger arise from within water?

Master Hua Yang Zi replies: The Dragon is the binding of the *jiǎ* and *yí* (first and second hours of the day)—how does it emerge from fire? Indeed, the fluid of the heart is the proper *yang* essence, so it is said that the *yang* Dragon emerges from the *Li Palace* (fire).

The Tiger is of the west, the *gēng* and *xīn* (seventh and eighth hours)—how does it arise from water? Indeed, the *qi* within the kidneys is the true One’s water. So it is said that the yin Tiger arises from the *Kan position* (water).

The Dragon is fundamentally a *yang* entity, yet it excels in ascent—when it is within water, it is *yang* within yin, and thus is likened to the proper *yang* essence above the heart’s fluid. The Tiger is fundamentally a yin entity, yet it excels in swiftness—when it is on land, it is yin within *yang*, and thus is likened to the true One’s water within the kidneys.

Master Yin Zhen Jun says: Why is the proper *qi* of the north called the *He Che* (River Vehicle)?

Master Hua Yang Zi replies: Within the human body, amidst all yin, there is a single point of primal *yang*. When this primal *yang* ascends, it permeates the *bāo luò* (uterine vessels and meridians), thus generating the primal *qi*, which is transmitted from the kidneys’ *qi* to the liver, from the liver’s *qi* to the heart, from the heart’s *qi* to the lungs, and from the lungs’ *qi* back to the kidneys.

This is the Lesser River Vehicle. It ascends from the *Wei Jian* (tail interval), passing through the lower *Guan* (passage), the middle *Guan*, and the upper *Guan*;」

「From the upper field to the middle field, from the middle field to the lower field—this is the Great River Vehicle. When pure yin descends, the true water arises; when pure yang ascends, the true fire awakens. As one ascends and the other descends, they meet within the twelve chambers, and the elixir manifests in its golden radiance, gathering and illuminating all paths. This is the **Zhīhé Chē** (Purple River Vehicle).

The River Vehicle’s movement through the river is akin to *qi* flowing through the blood meridians; the River Vehicle’s bearing of things is like *qi* containing the true water within it. Master Guāngchéng taught the Yellow Emperor to refine the elixir at **Kōngtóng**, where lead—among the five metals—is the black gold, and from black gold, one takes silver; where cinnabar—among the eight stones—is the red stone, and from red stone, one takes mercury. When mercury is combined with lead, this is what is called the **Treasure Elixir**—this is the external method.

Now, the true *qi* stored in the kidneys is lead. The true essence where yin and yang converge is mercury. When fire and heat are perfectly balanced, essence becomes mercury, mercury becomes cinnabar, and cinnabar becomes the elixir. Thus, it is said: *"This is the true lead."*

From the **Jǔhòu** (elbow posterior) golden radiance, it ascends into the upper palace, entering from the crown into the lower field. The true fire then arises and ascends into the **Níwán** (brain marrow), passing through the heart and descending into the **Chónglóu** (double chamber). As one yin and one yang interact—water ascending, fire descending—the **Jiéjì** (completion) method is achieved, and it races toward the **Yuán Hǎi** (primordial sea), becoming the **Zǐjīn** (purple-gold) elixir. Thus, it is said: *"This is the true mercury."*

Yin and yang have four exchanges and four unions:
- *"Yang exchanges with yin"* (陽交陰),
- *"Yin exchanges with yang"* (陰交陽),
- *"Yang exchanges with yang"* (陽交陽),
- *"Yin exchanges with yin"* (陰交陰);
- *"Yin unites with yang"* (陰合陽),
- *"Yang unites with yin"* (陽合陰),
- *"Yin unites with yin"* (陰合陰),
- *"Yang unites with yang"* (陽合陽).

These correspond to the eight celestial phases of heaven and earth and the eight seasonal junctures of the sun and moon. This is why one must not fail to recognize the nature of things.

Many have spoken of nurturing life in ancient and modern times, but those who *minimize thoughts and desires* can only nurture the heart; those who *sever attachments and forget worldly concerns* can only nurture the spirit; those who *moderate their diet* can only nurture the body; those who *practice moderation in labor and rest* can only nurture the vital *qi*; those who *enter purity and emerge from impurity* can only nurture the *qi*; those who *abstain from licentiousness and observe sexual restraint* can only nurture the essence.

Master Huáyáng says: These are not the ultimate ways of nurturing life. The adept in nurturing life, during the **reigning** (王) phases, *nurtures and draws upon* them; during the **waning** (衰) phases, *nurtures and supplements* them. In spring, one nurtures the spleen; in autumn, one nurtures the liver; in summer, one nurtures the lungs; in winter, one nurtures the heart.

Refining the body stirs the fire, while returning the elixir gathers the *qi*—this is the yearly and monthly application of the Dao.

Why nurture yang in spring and summer? Because the true *qi* follows the great celestial cycles, residing in the lungs and kidneys. The kidneys and lungs are where fluids descend. This is the method of yin-yang transmission.

The kidneys’ *qi* is generated at the hour of **Zǐ** (子, midnight), when one yang arises within two yin. At this time, one must *calm the mind and still the thoughts*, close the eyes, and elevate the body, inwardly visualizing fire ascending from the **Dāntián** (elixir field). This is the method of nurturing the generated *qi*.

The liver’s *qi* is generated at the hour of **Mǎo** (卯, dawn), when one yang arises within two yin. At this time, one must sit alone, close the eyes, *minimize outward activity and maximize inward stillness*, and inwardly store the vision of male and female uniting within the **Yellow House** (黃屋), producing a child. This is the method of nurturing the generated yang.

The heart’s *qi* is generated at the hour of **Wǔ** (午, noon), when one yin arises within two yang. At this time, one must *sever speech and forget all thoughts*, hold the saliva in the mouth to attack the heart’s *qi* without dispersing it, and inwardly store the vision of the **Dragon and Tiger** (龍虎) uniting within the **Smoky Flame** (煙焰), swirling in a **golden cauldron** (金鼎), and flowing into the lower elixir field. This is the method of nurturing the generated yin.

The lungs’ *qi* is generated at the hour of **Yǒu** (酉, dusk), when one yin arises within two yang. At this time, one must close the eyes, focus the mind, and gently press the abdomen, inwardly storing the vision of great fire searing within the cauldron. Within the cauldron, the **three mysteries** (三昧) fire blazes forth in radiant flames. This is the method of nurturing the generated yin at its proper time.

Thus, when the **three hundred-day embryo** (三百日胎) is complete and the true *qi* is generated, nurturing and refining it yields the spirit. The **three flowers gather at the crown** (三花聚頂), and the **five *qi* pay homage to the Primordial** (五氣朝元). When the **five hundred-day embryo** (五百日陽神) is complete and the yang spirit is generated, nurturing and refining it unites one with the Dao.

From the generation of form and its nurturing arises the true *qi*; from the nurturing of *qi* arises the **true body** (法身). The true body is the body beyond the body. This is the way of nurturing life.

The adept in nurturing the body must *clothe themselves first when cold*, not abruptly adding layers; and *remove clothing first when warm*, not abruptly shedding them. After prolonged exertion, one must rest to preserve their **extreme vitality** (極力); after prolonged idleness, one must practice **guided movements** (導引) to circulate their **stagnant *qi*** (滯氣).

In summer, if one sleeps in **dampness**, the *qi* scatters and blood stagnates; in winter, if one is exposed to **extreme heat**, the kidneys will be harmed by **false yang** (虛陽), and by the time of spring and summer, the liver and heart will inevitably suffer from **obstructive diseases** (壅蔽之疾); in summer, if one is exposed to **extreme cold**, the heart will embrace **floating chill**, and by the time of autumn and winter, the lungs and kidneys will inevitably suffer from **stagnant afflictions** (沉滯之患).

These are the precautions the adept in nurturing the body must observe.

One must not eat when **extremely hungry**, nor overeat when full—overindulgence harms the spirit, while excessive hunger harms the stomach. One must not drink when **extremely thirsty**, nor consume too much when sated—excessive intake weakens the *qi*, while excessive thirst harms the blood.

For **hair washing** (沐), one must use the **decade method** (旬者). The decade is when the number is complete and returns—when the true *qi* resides in the brain. Washing the hair makes the ears and eyes sharp and clear.

For **bathing** (浴), one must use the **pentad method** (五者). The pentad is when the five *qi* flow and transmit throughout the body, making the **honorific and defensive meridians** (榮衛) unobstructed. However, bathing must not be frequent—though it may make the skin and flesh luminous, it causes **blood congealing and *qi* scattering**, and over time, the *qi* is depleted, leading to **paralysis or atrophy** (癱痪之疾). This is when *qi* cannot overcome blood, and spirit cannot overcome form;」

「Hair washing must not be frequent—overuse causes *qi* to stagnate in the upper brain, congealing in the center, and over time, the **meridians and channels** (经络) cannot flow freely, leading to **heaviness of the body and weariness of the form** (体重形疲). Thus, the ancients cultivated **yang** to nourish **yang**—so that **yang** would not dissipate; they refined **yang** with **yin**—so that **yang** would not weaken.

Within a year, **spring and summer** cultivate **yang**, while **autumn and winter** cultivate **yin**—this is how one borrows **yin** to nourish **yang**, using **yang** to consume **yin**. Within a day, before noon, one refines **the Heavenly One (乾)** with *qi*—thus, one begins by refining the **form (形)**, and later cultivates **the Earthly One (金晶)**. After noon, one refines **the Earthly One (坤)** with medicine—thus, with medicine, one gathers *qi* to forge the **elixir (丹)**, or if lacking the elixir, one collects **fire (火)** to "boil the sea" (煮海). These are all ways in which **true yang** is applied to the body—my methods for nourishing the **form (形)**.

Now, the **bird’s single surge (禽之一冲)** is governed by *qi*, so it treads upon the void as if upon solid ground. The **pine and cypress’s firm *qi* (松柏之气)** is unyielding, so they remain ever verdant. The **tortoise and crane’s settled *qi* (龟鹤之气)** endures, so they never wither. Yet even if one excels in nourishing the **form (形)**, can one not also strive to cultivate *qi*?

For those who practice **silence (不语)** to preserve *qi*, it is truly **conserving *qi* (保气)**. But if they fail and become **dim-witted (昏)**, then to practice **clarity in intake, turbidity in release (入清出浊)** is to **exchange *qi* (换气)**. If they fail and become **empty (虚)**, then to **absorb much and release little (多入少出)**—even for attacking illness—is not **fetal breathing (胎息)**. To **swallow above and compress below (上咽下擂)**, gathering *qi* may be possible, but to **make it into the Returning Elixir (还丹)** is not.

To **maintain *qi* like a thread (绵绵若存)**, using it sparingly, is to **yield *qi* and harmonize the spirit (和神)**. To **settle the breath (息之要住)** and **retain what is inhaled (纳之不出)**, closing *qi* to refine the **form (形)**—this is possible. To **swallow once, then swallow again (一咽复一咽)**, double-gathering with twofold containment, using **empty swallowing (虚咽)** as the method, is to **cherish *qi* and extract essence as irrigation (惜气取水以溉灌)**.

To **sit upright and elevate the body (正坐升身)**, filling the **Four Great Elements (四大)** with *qi*, allowing the **blood channels (血络)** to flow freely, and harmonizing the **nutritive and defensive *qi* (营卫)**—this is to **distribute *qi* to burnish the body (布气以焚身)**. Yet these are not true methods of **cultivating *qi* (养气)**.

True cultivation of *qi* means:
- Nourishing it at the time of birth, so it does not decline.
- Nourishing it when it is weak, so it does not perish.

The ancients who embodied the **trigram Zhen (屯)** took **yang** at its nascent stage—when it is bent yet not yet stretched—thus, they practiced **Zhen at dawn (朝屯)** to cultivate the **flourishing of *qi* (气之茂)**. Those who embodied the **trigram Meng (蒙)** took **one yang** amid **grouped yin**—when it is obscured and unclear—thus, they practiced **Meng at dusk (暮蒙)** to seek the **principle of yang (阳之义)**.

Thus, *qi* must not be harmed. If one’s **talent (才)** is not sharp yet forces **excessive thinking (强思)**, it will be injured. If one’s **strength (力)** is insufficient yet forces **excessive exertion (强举)**, it will be injured. **Sorrow and grief (悲哀)** lead to **emaciation (憔悴)**, which exhausts *qi*. **Excessive joy or anger (喜怒过度)** will injure it. **Pursuing desires with haste (汲汲所欲)** will injure it. **Nursing grudges (戚戚所怀)** will injure it.

Not only this—**prolonged speech or raucous laughter (久谈剧笑)**, **sleeping or resting at improper times (寝息失时)**, **drawing the bow or tensioning the crossbow (挽弓张弩)**, **indulging in wine and vomiting (耽酒呕吐)**, **eating until sated (饱食则外)**, **leaping about and panting (跳步喘息)**, **shouting or weeping (欢呼哭泣)**, **failure of yin-yang interaction (阴阳不交)**, or **accumulated injuries until exhaustion (积伤至尽)**—all these lead to **premature death (夭)**.

True cultivation of *qi* lies in **dwelling in stillness and solitude (寂寞)**, **indifference without desire (淡然无欲)**—for at the **winter solstice (冬至)**, **yang** begins to arise. After the **spring equinox (春分)**, when **yang is strong and yin disperses**, one must guard against **residual yin entering the abdomen (腹)**, causing **bitter cold afflictions (苦寒之患)**; at the **summer solstice (夏至)**, **yin** within **yang** is born. After the **autumn equinox (秋分)**, when **yin is strong and yang disperses**, one must guard against **residual yang entering the abdomen**, causing **severe heat afflictions (酷暑之患)**.

Do not **observe the dead (死)**, for their *qi* **clashes with the living’s *qi* (触生气)**. Do not **draw near filth (秽)**, for its *qi* **clashes with true *qi* (触真气)**. Before the **solstice of life-force (真气未壮)**, do not **eat until empty (虚食)** at dawn—always **keep the mouth full (常充口)**. When **true *qi* nears depletion (真气欲绝)**, do not **eat until sated (实食)** at dusk—always **leave the mouth partially empty (常臧口)**.

For *qi* is like a **thread (缕)**—if touched, it is severed. It is like **marriage bonds (姻)**—if disturbed, it scatters. If one cannot **nourish it properly (养之)**, one loses the **way of preserving the form (保形之道)**.

Yet **cultivating *qi* (养气)** is inferior to **gathering medicine (采药)**, and **gathering medicine** is inferior to **refining *qi* (炼气)**. To **gather *qi* and return it to its origin (采气还元)**, one can forge **the Golden Elixir (金丹)** and attain **transformation (羽化)**. Thus, before refining, one must first gather, and before gathering, one must first **nourish (养)**—this is what I call **cultivating *qi* (养气)**.

Humans take the **form (形)** as their dwelling and the **heart (心)** as their master. The heart is **fire (火)**—it is the **essence of the South (南方)**, the **abiding yang (盛阳)**. Its **lodging is in the wandering star (荧惑)**, its **spirit is the Vermilion Bird (朱雀)**, its **shape is three leaves (三叶)**, its **color is the red lotus (朱莲)**—this is where **divine clarity (神明)** depends.

Thus, to **receive life from the Dao (从道受生)** is called **fate (命)**; to **inherit the form from one’s parents (自一禀形)** is called **nature (性)**. The **heart’s role in governing the body (任物)** is called **mind (心)**. The ancient **sages (至人)** taught people to **cultivate the Dao (修道)**, which is to **cultivate the heart (修心)**.

To **empty the heart (虚心)** is to **return it to its true nature (还其实)**. To **have no heart (无心)** is to **remove its false attachments (除其有)**. To **settle the heart (定心)** is to **keep it unmoved (不动)**. To **calm the heart (安心)** is to **keep it from peril (不危)**. To **quiet the heart (静心)** is to **keep it from chaos (不乱)**. To **rectify the heart (正心)** is to **keep it from deviance (不邪)**. To **purify the heart (清心)** is to **keep it from turbidity (不浊)**. To **cool the heart (冷心)** is to **keep it from defilement (不秽)**.

Moreover, this depends on **few thoughts and few recollections (少思少念)**, **few desires and few affairs (少欲少事)**, **few words and few laughs (少语少笑)**, **few sorrows and few joys (少愁少乐)**, **few likes and few dislikes (少好少恶)**—so that **the divine light (灵光)** does not stray, and **spirit-*qi* (神气)** does not go wild, and only then can one **enter the Dao (入道)**.

**Excessive thinking (多思)** weakens the **spirit (神)**. **Excessive recollection (多念)** scatters the **will (志)**. **Excessive desire (多欲)** shortens **lifespan (寿)**. **Excessive affairs (多事)** enslaves the **form (形)**. **Excessive speech (多语)** weakens *qi*. **Excessive laughter (多笑)** harms the **viscera (藏)**. **Excessive sorrow (多愁)** **congeals the blood (摄血)**. **Excessive joy (多乐)** **overflows the mind (溢意)**. **Excessive delight (多喜)** disturbs *qi*. **Excessive anger (多怒)** unsettles the **hundred vessels (百脉)**. **Excessive likes (多好)** bring **stupor (昏迷)**. **Excessive dislikes (多恶)** lead to **emaciation (憔悴)**.

If its **source is impure (源不洁)**, the **harmonious *qi* (和气)** will naturally **deplete (耗)**. This is my teaching on **nourishing the heart (养心)**.

To **gather the spirit (集灵)** and **resource the Dao (资道)**, when **spirit-*qi* (神气)** **converges harmoniously (相合)**, it becomes **lifespan (寿)**—the greatest may reach **twelve thousand years (一万二千岁)**, the moderate **one thousand two hundred years (一千二百岁)**, the lesser **one hundred and twenty years (一百二十岁)**.

To know the **methods of refinement (修炼之方)** yet not know how to **nourish lifespan (养其寿)**, then **refinement is in vain (无功)**. How does one **nourish lifespan**?

To **walk without excessive speech (行不多言)**, for speech **injures the spirit and depletes *qi* (伤神而损气)**...」

「Sleep without opening the mouth, lest it **leak *qi* and harm the spirit** (*泄气而损神*).

Do not **venture near peril to ascend heights** (*临危而登峻*), lest the **soul depart** (*魂飞*).
Do not **engage in bloodshed or witness combat** (*玩杀、看斗*), lest the **vital *qi* stagnate** (*气结*).
Do not **lament the dead or inquire about illness** (*吊死、问疾*), lest the **spirit be scattered by excessive sorrow** (*喜神散*).
Do not **sleep in dampness or face the wind** (*卧湿、当风*), lest the **true *qi* weaken** (*真气弱*).
Do not **enter ancient temples or places of ill omen** (*古庙凶祠*), lest the **spirit be startled** (*神惊*).
Do not **mock wild or strange beasts** (*戏狂禽异兽*), lest the **spirit be alarmed** (*神恐*).
Do not **lie down before the Three Lights** (*对三光而没*), nor **utter frivolous or false speech** (*绮语妄言*), lest it **shorten one’s years** (*损年*).

When **feasting, do not defile oneself before sacred images** (*亵於圣像*), lest the **soul and vital essence be restless** (*魂魄不安*).
When **sitting outdoors, avoid proximity to mounds and graves** (*近於丘墓*), lest the **spirit and *qi* disperse** (*精神散*).
Do not **rest upon withered trees or large trees** (*枯木大树*), lest the **prolonged yin-*qi* of their roots disturb the yang spirit** (*久阴之气触阳神*).
Do not **cross deep waters or vast marshes** (*探水大泽*), lest the **extreme coldness of their nature oppress the true *qi*** (*至寒之性逼真气*).
Do not **consume untimely fruits** (*不时之果*), lest they **harbor internal pathogenic *qi*** (*内邪气*).

This is my teaching on **nourishing lifespan** (*养寿者也*).

The **kidney** (*肾*) of the male is **preeminent** (*先生*), for it **encases yin within yang** (*外精内血*), with **yin as its core** (*以阴为裹*).
The **kidney** (*肾*) of the female is **preeminent** (*先生*), for it **encases yang within yin** (*外血内精*), with **yang as its core** (*以阳为裹*).

From the kidneys, the **spleen** (*脾*) is born; from the spleen, the **liver** (*肝*); from the liver, the **lungs** (*肺*); from the lungs, the **heart** (*心*); from the heart, the **small intestine** (*小肠*); from the small intestine, the **large intestine** (*大肠*); from the large intestine, the **gallbladder** (*胆*); from the gallbladder, the **urinary bladder** (*膀胱*); from the urinary bladder, the **Three Elements** (*三元*); from the Three Elements, the **Three Burners** (*三焦*); from the Three Burners, the **Eight Vessels** (*八脉*); from the Eight Vessels, the **Twelve Channels** (*十二经*); from the Twelve Channels, the **Twelve Collaterals** (*十二络*); from the Twelve Collaterals, the **One Hundred and Eighty System Collaterals** (*百八十系络*); from the System Collaterals, the **One Hundred and Eighty Encirclement Collaterals** (*百八十缠络*); from the Encirclement Collaterals, the **Thirty-Six Thousand External Collaterals** (*三万六千外络*); from the External Collaterals, the **Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Bones** (*三百六十五骨*); from the bones, the **Eighty-Four Thousand Hair Orifices** (*八万四千毛窍*).

**Essence** (*精*) is the **mother**; **vital *qi*** (*气*) is the **master**.
Each of the **Five Zang** (*五藏*) has its **essence**; within the essence, **vital *qi*** is born.
Each of the Five Zang has its **vital *qi***; within the *qi*, **spirit** is born.

**Refining essence** can yield **elixir** (*丹*), **nourishing *qi*** can cultivate **spirit** (*神*), and this is the **Dao of longevity** (*长生之道*).

Those who **skillfully nourish life** (*善养命*) do so by **nurturing the roots of the Five Zang** (*养其五藏之根*), for when the **roots are firm, the branches flourish** (*根固叶自茂*).
Those who **skillfully nourish form** (*善养形*) do so by **nourishing the Five Types of Vital *Qi*** (*养其五气*), for the **Five Types of Vital *Qi*** are the **source**, and when the **source is deep, the flow is long** (*源深流自长*).

Yet each of the Five Zang has its **seasonal weakness** (*一时*), hence one **Zang reigns while another falters** (*一王则一弱*).
I can **supplement them**, making them **harmonious**, and then the **hundreds of bones** (*百骸*) **function properly**, while **hundreds of ailments** (*百疾*) **are dispelled**.

When **true *qi* moves in great cycles** (*真气大运*), it follows the **heavenly seasons** (*随於天*).
When **elemental *qi* moves in lesser cycles** (*元气小运*), it follows the **daily solar rhythms** (*随於日*).

In **spring**, when the **liver reigns and the spleen falters** (*肝王脾弱*), one should **consume sweet foods to nourish the spleen** (*食甘以养其脾*)—**brown rice** (*粳米*), **dates** (*枣*), **beef** (*牛*), **chive greens** (*葵菜*).
**Calm the heart and avoid sorrow or dread**, lest it **injure the liver** (*清心而无忧恐，其伤於肝*).
The liver **abhors wind**; thus, one should **retire and sit quietly to avoid it** (*恶风，则隐坐以避焉*).
In terms of the **solar hour**, at the **Mao hour** (*卯之时*), one should **await the lesser cycle’s birth from elemental *qi*** (*以待小运生乎元气*), as it **transmits to the liver**; thus, **close the eyes to nourish the liver** (*传送於肝，暝目以养其肝*), and in a **decade** (*一旬*), one can **perceive autumn hairs** (*可以视秋毫*).

In **summer**, when the **heart reigns and the lungs falter** (*心王肺弱*), one should **consume pungent foods to nourish the lungs** (*食辛以养其肺*)—**yellow millet** (*黄黍*), **peaches** (*桃*), **parrot flesh** (*鹦*), **onion greens** (*葱菜*).
**Calm the heart and temper excessive joy or dread**, lest it **injure the heart** (*清心而少喜恐，其伤於心*).
The heart **abhors heat**; thus, one should **sit quietly to avoid it** (*恶热，则静坐以避焉*).
In terms of the **solar hour**, at the **Wu hour** (*午之时*), one should **await the lesser cycle’s birth from elemental *qi*** (*以待小运生乎元气*), as it **transmits to the heart**; thus, **quiet the mind and reside peacefully to nourish the heart** (*传送於心，绝念安居，以养其心*), and in a **decade**, one can **harmonize the Hundred Vessels** (*可以通百脉*).

In **autumn**, when the **lungs reign and the liver falters** (*肺王肝弱*), one should **consume sour foods to nourish the liver** (*食酸以养其肝*)—**beans** (*豆*), **plums** (*李*), **dog meat** (*犬*), **radish greens** (*蕾菜*).
**Calm the heart and avoid grief or dread**, lest it **injure the lungs** (*清心而勿悲恐，其有伤於肺*).
The lungs **abhor cold**; thus, one should **reside quietly to avoid it** (*恶寒，则静居以避焉*).
In terms of the **solar hour**, at the **You hour** (*酉之时*), one should **await the lesser cycle’s birth from elemental *qi*** (*以待小运生乎元气*), as it **transmits to the lungs**; thus, **elevate the body and sit quietly to nourish the lungs** (*传送於肺，升身静坐，以养其肺*), and in a **decade**, the **skin will radiate luster** (*其肤光泽*).

In **winter**, when the **kidneys reign and the heart falters** (*肾王心弱*), one should **consume bitter foods to nourish the heart** (*食苦以养其心*)—**wheat** (*小麦*), **mandarins** (*橘*), **mutton** (*羊*), **gourd greens** (*球菜*).
**Calm the heart and avoid dread**, lest it **injure the heart** (*清心而无恐，恐其有伤於心*).
In terms of the **solar hour**, at the **Zi hour** (*子之时*), one should **await the lesser cycle’s birth from elemental *qi*** (*以待小运生乎元气*), as it **transmits to the kidneys**; thus, **draw inward and sit upright to nourish the kidneys** (*传送於肾，敛身正坐，以养其肾*), and in a **decade**, the **elixir field will be warm**, and the **vital *qi* and strength will be robust** (*丹田暖而气力刚健*).

In the **intermediate seasons**, when the **spleen reigns and the kidneys falter** (*脾王肾弱*), one should **consume salty foods to nourish the kidneys** (*食咸以养其肾*)—**millet** (*粟*), **mountain yam** (*山药*), **pork** (*猜*), **garlic greens** (*韭菜*).
**Reside peacefully and avoid dread**, lest it **injure the spleen** (*安心而无恐，恐其有伤於脾*).
The spleen **abhors dampness**; thus, one should **sit quietly to avoid it** (*恶湿，则静坐以避焉*).
In terms of the **solar hour**, at the **Chen, Xiu, Chou, and Wei hours** (*辰戌丑未之时*), one should **await the lesser cycle’s birth from elemental *qi*** (*以待小运生乎元气*), as it **transmits residual *qi* to the spleen**; thus, **reside in a quiet chamber, conserve breath, minimize exhalation** (*传送余气於脾，静室闭气，多入少出，以养其脾*), and in a **decade**, the **body will radiate brilliance**, and the **channels and collaterals will flow freely** (*则体光华，而经络畅*).

If one **refines with lesser effort** (*修炼下功*), then the **Five Zang need not be so meticulously tended** (*五藏不必如是*).

This is my teaching on **internal supplementation** (*补内*).

The **heart** (*心*), **kidneys** (*肾*), **liver** (*肝*), **lungs** (*肺*), and **spleen** (*脾*) are the **Five Zang**.
The **large intestine** (*大肠*), **small intestine** (*小肠*), **urinary bladder** (*膀胱*), **Three Burners** (*三焦*), **gallbladder** (*胆*), and **stomach** (*胃*) are the **Six Fu** (*六府*).
The **hair and skin**, the **eyes, ears, nose, and tongue**, and the **hands and feet** are the **four limbs** (*四体*); the **Nourishing and Defensive *qi*** (*荣卫*), **channels and collaterals** (*经络*), and **orifices** (*穴*) are also part of them.

The **heart’s *qi* resides in the liver** (*心之气在肝*), and the liver **generates essence** (*自生精*).
If the **essence is not firm** (*其精不固*), then the **eyes will dim and lack luster** (*目眩无光*).
The **heart’s *qi* resides in the lungs** (*心之气在肺*), and the lungs **generate essence** (*自生精*).
If the **essence is not substantial** (*其精不实*), then the **flesh and muscles will weaken** (*肌肉弱*).
The **heart’s *qi* resides in the kidneys** (*心之气在肾*), and the kidneys **generate essence** (*自生精*).
If the **essence is not full** (*其精不满*), then the **spirit and *qi* will be diminished** (*神气臧少*).
The **heart’s *qi* resides in the spleen** (*心之气在脾*), and the spleen **generates essence** (*自生精*).
If the **essence is not strong** (*其精不坚*), then the **hair and teeth will wither** (*发齿自衰*).

The kidneys are the **sea of essence** (*精海*), and the heart is the **hall of *qi*** (*气馆*).
**True essence** (*真精*) resides in the kidneys, while the **remaining essence** (*余精*) returns to the **lower field** (*下田*).
**True *qi*** (*真气*) resides in the heart, and the **remaining *qi*** (*余气*) ascends to the **central realm** (*中元*).

When **thoughts and worries, grief, and sorrow** (*思虑悲哀*) deplete the *qi*, it is like a leak in the **boiling cauldron’s *qi*** (*鼎中之气*).
When **lustful desires and calamitous excesses** (*淫邪祸乱*) dissipate the essence, it is like splitting **firewood beneath the cooking pot** (*析薪釜下*).

The **method of replenishment** (*补之之道*) must first **sever what is improper** (*先绝者也*), particularly in the **chamber arts** (*房中*).

**Essence** (*精*)—from whence does it arise?
All things receive the **pure and refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth** (*天地纯粹之气*), while humans **consume the nourishing resources of the ten thousand things** (*万物充实之资*) in food.
When ingested into the **stomach** (*胃*), it blends with **true *qi*** (*真气*) and circulates downward to the kidneys, filling their **voids** (*虚气*).

When **perceptions evoke the mind** (*对境生心*), the **heart’s fire** (*心之火*) presses down upon the kidneys, preventing the *qi* from ascending.
It **spirals left and right** (*左旋右盘*), like a **violent wind and thunderous clap** (*急风震雷*), piercing through the **bladder** (*膀胱*), transforming into **essence’s refinement** (*精华*).
Thus, **true *qi* is lost** (*真气走失*), and **fire ascends** (*火上起*).
The **lungs open** (*肺开*) while the **heart is disrupted** (*心冲*), the **liver floats** (*肝浮*) and the **gallbladder is unrestrained** (*胆横*).
All **spirits** (*万神*) are scorched by **true fire** (*真火*), wandering outside the body.
**Bones dissolve** (*骨解*), **sinews slacken** (*筋伸*), and it is **no different from death** (*与死无异*).

Thus, **one emission weakens one breath of *qi*** (*一泄则一气弱*), **a hundred emissions deplete one spirit** (*百泄则一神去*), **a thousand emissions damage one organ** (*千泄则一藏损*), until **exhaustion and death** (*枯竭而死*).

Yet, the **Supreme Sage** (*上圣*) possesses the **method of returning essence** (*还精之道*).
If **one’s will is fixed upon the Mysterious Origin** (*志在於玄元*), then the **kidneys’ *qi* merges with the heart’s *qi*** (*肾气交於心气*), accumulating *qi* to generate **fluid** (*液*).
It is **like a suspended bead or dripping dew** (*悬珠垂露*), returning to the **elixir field** (*丹田*).
With **fire and conditions in harmony** (*火候无差*), it **naturally congeals** (*自然凝结*).
Its form is **like a round pellet** (*其形弹丸*), its hue **crimson and orange** (*其色朱橘*).
Thus, **within *qi* arises *qi*** (*气中生气*), **essence and *qi* coalesce into spirit** (*精气成神*), and its accumulation **can lead to sainthood** (*入圣*).

Those of **shallow learning and ignorance** (*少学而无知*), however, **harvest the vital *qi* of maidens** (*采女之津气*) as **yin elixir** (*阴丹*), and **refine metals and minerals** (*炼金石*) into **external elixir** (*外丹*).
When their *qi* is **abundant** (*气盛*), **no harm is yet seen** (*未见其损*).
But when **primordial yang is dissipated** (*元阳耗散*), the **elixir field is void** (*丹台空虚*), and **they ingest it again** (*饵之在复*), then **rapid decline and death** (*速亡之患*) ensue—**unlike my method of replenishing essence** (*非若吾所以补精者也*).

**Yang arises from within Earth** (*地中阳生*), **emanating from yin** (*自阴中来*).
**Yin descends from Heaven** (*天中阴降*), **emanating from yang** (*自阳中来*).

There is no loss, yet there are faults of trembling and imbalance.

Now, consider the kidneys—water indeed. Within water, *qi* arises, subtle as a thread. Yet the Six Desires harm from without, the Seven Emotions from within. The heavy palaces [of the mind] scatter upward, the Golden Tortoise [kidney essence] is spilled downward. How could this not be like a fish slipping through a net or wind escaping a bag—how could there be no damage? Then how can one fail to know the Dao of nourishing *qi*?

The Celestial Sovereign’s Sacred Embryo is the Supreme Method; Damo’s Embryonic Breath is the Middle Method; Bian Que’s exposition of *The Spiritual Pivot* and Ge Hong’s elucidation of Embryonic Breath—nurturing breath from the embryo, guiding breath to the embryo—is the Inferior Method. This is what I call nourishing *qi*.

The methods of supplementation are manifold. Rising and resting follow the early and late hours of the Four Seasons; movement and stillness adhere to the constant measures of harmony. Adjusting sinews and vessels has its reclining and upright methods; nourishing the true and expelling the false has the protective techniques of inhalation and exhalation. Circulating the Circulation and Defense has the laws of supplementation and drainage; moderating labor and rest has the essentials of giving and withholding. Restrain anger to preserve yin; suppress joy to nourish yang. With purity and emptiness, dispel frantic thoughts; with tranquility and ease, cultivate the true nature. Nourish *qi* with *qi*, and *qi* will naturally abound; nourish spirit with spirit, and spirit will never be lacking. When *qi* is abundant, the body endures; when spirit dwells, life is prolonged.

Before noon, one may refine the Heavenly Stem [yang]; after noon, one may refine the Earthly Branch [yin]. Its *qi* arises from the kidneys and begins at the Hour of Child, ending at the Hour of Noon—its *qi* ascends and reigns.

Refining the Heavenly Stem—how so? Sit quietly in a secluded chamber, close your eyes, and quiet your mind. Remain motionless, allowing *qi* to fill the Four Great [elements], permeating your body. When Circulation and Defense harmonize, after days of practice, *qi* flourishes and the Defense clears.

When kidney *qi* reaches the heart, accumulated *qi* generates fluid. This fluid arises from the heart, beginning at the Hour of Noon and ending at the Hour of Child—its fluid descends and thrives.

Refining the Earthly Branch—how so? Close your eyes and quiet your mind. Sit upright, clasping your abdomen with both hands. Lower the heart’s fire to the elixir field, simmering the *qi* of the Sea of Vitality. After days of practice, *qi* reigns and spirit clears.

This is supplementation of *qi*.

In winter, avoid cold; in summer, avoid heat. Avoid wind in cold, heat in warmth. Do not overtax the limbs in motion, nor neglect the skin in repose. Bathe every five days, wash hair every ten. Do not move when *qi* reigns; do not neglect when blood reigns.

This is supplementation of *qi*.

Thus, supplementation of the form is not as good as supplementation of essence; supplementation of essence is not as good as supplementation of *qi*; supplementation of *qi* is not as good as supplementation of spirit. When spirit is supplemented, form and spirit are eternally at peace—near to the Dao of the Transcendent.

The man’s *qi* measures eight hundred and ten *zhang*—eighty-one times nine, the pure yang number. The woman’s blood measures three *dan* and six *dou*—thirty-six times six, the pure yin number. *Qi* diminishes by nine times nine, blood is exhausted by six times six—this is the natural order. Yet to die and decay without cultivation—how lamentable!

The daily prohibition: do not drink to excess at dusk. The yearly prohibition: do not travel far at dusk. The lifelong prohibition: do not indulge in sex by candlelight at dusk. These are the great principles of supplementation and loss.

The Five Flavors must not be overindulged. Thus, sour harms the spleen, sweet harms the kidneys, salty harms the heart, bitter harms the lungs, pungent harms the liver—these must be guarded against.

Before the Great Elixir is complete, hunger and thirst remain. Three meals a day must not be overeaten. Morning meals should not be empty; evening meals should not be full—this is the superior way. Plain and flavorless, bland and without meat—this is the secondary way.

When the Five Viscera accumulate stagnation, use inhalation (*hu*), exhalation (*he*), swallowing (*yan*), blowing (*chui*), laughter (*xi*), and sighing (*xu*) to treat them. Yet in spring, do not exhale; in summer, do not swallow; in winter, do not inhale; in autumn, do not sigh. Laughing in all four seasons ensures the Triple Burner lacks nothing. Blowing at the Eight Nodes ensures the kidney palace can be filled.

If there is excess, draw upon its child; if deficient, kill its ghost—why so? The liver is inherently sighing. If you draw its child, use exhalation to drain the heart’s *qi*. Once the heart’s *qi* flows, the liver’s *qi* will naturally transmit. If the liver’s *qi* is deficient, the one who kills its ghost is the lung—metal overcoming wood. Wood is the wife, metal the husband. The husband is the ghost. When the liver weakens, the lung has excess; use swallowing to drain it.

If neither excess nor deficiency prevails, yin and yang will naturally harmonize. This is my method of supplementation and loss.

The kidneys are water; when *qi* arises within, it becomes fire. The heart is fire; when fluid arises within, it becomes water. At the Winter Solstice, yang arises from Earth; by the Summer Solstice, it reaches Heaven, accumulating yang and generating yin. Yin responds to yin, and yin is not depleted. Thus, it disperses as mist, condenses as dew. Mist and dew are the yin that Heaven produces as true water.

At the Summer Solstice, yin descends from Heaven; by the Winter Solstice, it reaches Earth, accumulating yin and generating yang. Yang responds to yang, and yang is not depleted. Thus, it ascends as clouds, falls as rain. Clouds and rain are the yang that Earth produces as true fire.

It is like the beginning of conception in a person: the two *qi*s unite, and yang *qi* ascends—making the heart the hall of *qi*, where true water is hidden within. Yin *qi* descends, making the kidneys the water palace, where true *qi* is hidden within. Otherwise, how could kidney *qi* reach the heart, generating fluid from accumulated *qi*—how could one yin arise? Two yangs of heart *qi* reaching the kidneys generate *qi* from accumulated fluid—how could one yang arise from two yins?

Thus, a person possesses three *fires* and eight *waters*. The *waters* arise when one *qi* transmits to another, accumulating *qi* to generate fluid, and each of the five *zàng* organs contains its own fluid—this is called **color-water** (*sèshuǐ*).

Within kidney *qi*, the **true-one water** (*zhēn-yī shuǐ*) is hidden, manifesting as the **yin tiger** (*yīnhǔ*), its name being **true water**. The **golden crystal** (*fēijīn jīng*) that flies from the elbow, entering the **upper palace** (*shànggōng*), descends from above to below, meeting with **true fire** (*zhēnhuǒ*) to complete **the accomplished** (*jìjiē*), and this is called **spirit-water** (*shénshuǐ*).

For those afflicted with illness, they should **close their mouths and inhale *qi*** (*bìkǒu nàqì*), swallowing once again and once again, directing it steadily within to where the disease resides—this is called **method-water** (*fǎshuǐ*).

When the **elixir** (*dān*) is formed and poured forth, it becomes the **baptismal method** (*mùyù zhī fǎ*); when the form is refined and **true *qi*** (*zhēnqì*) is generated, it becomes the **reverting elixir method** (*huándān zhī fǎ*).

**Pure Yang Master** (*Chúnyáng Zǐ*) says:
*"When water and fire meet in the Two Radiant Palaces (*liǎngyào diàn*), seven treasures are cast,
A single stream flows to bestow eight nectars of jade.
This is the **jade nectar reverting elixir** (*yùyè huándān*)."*

*"Water and fire come together in mutual inquiry,
The hexagram soars to form **Earth-Heaven Accomplishment** (*Dìtiān Tài*).
One ascends, one descends—yang refines yin,
Only when yin is exhausted does one grasp this truth profound.
This is the **water-fire accomplished** (*shuǐhuǒ jìjiē*)."*

**Free-and-Easy Master** (*Xiāoyáo Zǐ*) says:
*"Method-water can dawn with hidden passes,
Free-and-easy sends it circling night and day.
This is the **method-water** that treats disease."*

Now, what are the **three fires**? The **bladder** (*pángguāng*) is the **people’s fire** (*mínhuǒ*); the **kidneys** (*shèn*) are the **minister’s fire** (*chénhuǒ*); the **heart** (*xīn*) is the **sovereign’s fire** (*jūnhuǒ*). The ignorant, being disturbed by things, may even reach **anger and sorrow** (*nù qǐ yōu*), becoming the **fire of ignorance** (*wúmíng zhī huǒ*).

If one **descends and lowers** (*jiàng ér xiàfén*) to **sear the elixir field** (*Dāntián*), with **sincerity steadfast** (*zhìchéng shǒuzhī*), **unscattered in purpose** (*yīyì bùsàn*), this is called **burning the elixir** (*shāodān*). When its **fire ascends** (*huǒ shēng*), rising from below, passing through the **three passes** (*sān guān*), this is called **river-chariot** (*héchē*). Before it ascends, its **fire emerges** (*huǒ qǐ*), passing above the **double pavilion** (*chónglóu*), and this is called **refining the form** (*liànxíng*). When both **fire emerges before and after** (*qiánhòu gùqǐ*), filling the **four great elements** (*sìdà*), this is called **consuming the body** (*fénshēn*).

**Consuming the body** (*fénshēn*) is practiced by entering a **chamber of stillness** (*jìngshì*), loosening one’s hair, spreading one’s garments, closing one’s eyes, and **calming the mind** (*míngxīn*). Sitting upright and **holding fast** (*wògù*), one **knocks the teeth and gathers spirit** (*kòuchǐ jíshén*), then **ascends the body and ignites the fire** (*shēngshēn qǐhuǒ*), subtly **retaining the breath** (*liúxī*), entering slowly and exiting tardily. In silence, one **visualizes** (*mòxiǎng*) as if beneath the navel there is a **fire-wheel** (*huǒlún*), its size like a **dipper** (*dǒu*), and soon the **fire arises** (*huǒ qǐ*), encircling the body like a wheel—covering it entirely, so that **yin evils dare not approach** (*yīn xié bùgǎn jìn yǐ*).

Practitioners of this must **long abandon desires** (*xū shìyù jiǔjué*), ensuring the **elixir root is firm** (*dānyuán jiāngù*), before it may be done.
This is my **true water-fire** (*zhēnshuǐhuǒ*).

**Pure Yang Master** (*Chúnyáng Zǐ*) says:
*"Observing **Master Cui’s Elixir Mirror** (*Yàojìng*), one’s heart and mind become clear.
The **yang dragon** (*yánglóng*) speaks of emerging from **the hexagram of the Trigrams** (*Lí zhī zhōng*), the **yin tiger** (*yīnhǔ*) returns to **the hexagram of the Abyss** (*Kǎn shàng shēng*).
When these two meet, it is the **source of the Dao** (*dàoběn*).
The **five phases** (*wǔfāng*) complete their course, and one attains the **name of the elixir** (*dān míng*).
Those who cultivate the **highest truth** (*xiūzhēn shàngshì*), if they know this,
Will **ride the red dragon** (*chìlóng*) and return to **the jade capital** (*yùjīng*)."*

The **Elixir Mirror** (*Yàojìng*) states:
*"Within the kidneys, *qi* is generated.
Within the *qi*, **true-one water** (*zhēn-yī shuǐ*) is hidden—
This is the **yin tiger** (*yīnhǔ*) born from **the hexagram of the Abyss** (*Kǎn*).
Within the heart, fluid is generated.
Within the fluid, **pure yang *qi*** (*chúnyáng qì*) is hidden—
This is the **yang dragon** (*yánglóng*) born from **the hexagram of the Trigrams** (*Lí*).
Thus, the **dragon** (*lóng*) is not the **liver** (*gān*); the **tiger** (*hǔ*) is not the **lung** (*fèi*).
Yet who can **grasp the moment of their union** (*dá jiāohuì zhī shí*) and **awaken to the method of gathering** (*wù cǎiqǔ zhī fǎ*)?

When kidney *qi* transmits to liver *qi*, the liver *qi* is thus generated.
Then, the **residual yin** (*shèngyīn*) of the kidneys enters the **spleen** (*pí*), and its *qi*, passing through the spleen, becomes **pure yang** (*chúnyáng*).
Within this *qi* lies **true-one water** (*zhēn-yī shuǐ*), reaching the heart, where accumulated *qi* generates fluid—
Like a **pendant pearl** (*xuánzhū*) and **hanging dew** (*chuí lù*), returning to the **lower elixir field** (*xiàtián*), no longer descending with **the hexagram of the Abyss** (*Kǎn*) to transmit to the bladder.

The ability to **use the fire’s timing without error** (*huǒ yòng wú chā*), refining it into **one *qi*** (*yīqì*), with *qi* merging and **spirit gathering** (*shén jù*), is when kidney *qi* unites with heart *qi*—this is the **tiger joining the dragon** (*hǔ jiāo lóng*).

When **lowering the fire** (*xiàhuǒ*) and **storing it** (*jiāzàng*) is timed, **withdrawing and supplementing** (*chōutiān yǒushù*), with heart *qi* uniting with kidney *qi*—this is the **dragon joining the tiger** (*lóng jiāo hǔ*).

If the **lower pass is open** (*xià guān tòu yǐ*), emerging from **the tail pass** (*wěiyān*), the **left ascent** (*zuǒ shēng*) is the **dragon** (*lóng*), the **right ascent** (*yòuqǐ*) is the **tiger** (*hǔ*).

When the *qi* travels from the **double-spine passes** (*jiājǐ shuāng guān*) to the **dividing paths** (*fēndào lǐng*), it reaches the **inner courtyard** (*nèiyuàn*), where **yang dragon *qi*** (*yánglóng qì*) enters, and the **heavenly pool** (*tiānchí*), where **yin tiger *qi*** (*yīnhǔ qì*) enters. **Left revolving, right spiraling** (*zuǒ xuán yòu pán*), thirty-six cycles (*sànshù*), then **true water descends** (*zhēnshuǐ xiàjiàng*), like **sweet dew entering the heart** (*gānlù rùxīn*).
This is the **dragon joining in the upper palace** (*lóng jiāo shànggōng*), not necessarily distinguishing between **upper union and lower merging** (*shàngjiāo xiàhé*) in heart and kidneys.

When the **embryo is complete** (*tāiquán*) and **true *qi*** (*zhēnqì*) is born, one must **guard against excess** (*fáng qí tàiguò*), ensuring it is **accomplished with water** (*bì jì yǐshuǐ*), thus attaining the **jade nectar and golden nectar reverting elixir** (*yùyè jīnyè huándān*).

Over time, it **travels through the meridians and collaterals** (*jīngluò*), transforming into **yang fat** (*yángsū*).
When it **congeals in the central palace** (*zhōngfǔ*), it **accumulates white snow** (*jī bái xuě*).
Guard against excess, and **raise it with fire** (*bì jǔ yǐhuǒ*), thus attaining **refining the essence and consuming the body** (*liànzhì fénshēn*).

At the time of **reverting the elixir** (*huándān*), the **yin tiger** (*yīnhǔ*) moves alone, not necessarily joining with the **dragon** (*lóng*).
At the time of **consuming the body** (*fénshēn*), the **yang dragon** (*yánglóng*) ascends alone, not necessarily joining with the **tiger** (*hǔ*).
Within **three hundred days** (*sān bǎi rì*), the **inner elixir** (*nèidān*) is complete, and one may **align with Heaven and Earth** (*kě yǔ tiāndì qí yǐ*).

This is what I call the **true dragon and tiger** (*zhēnlónghǔ*).

**Master Guangcheng** (*Guǎngchéng Zǐ*) says:
*"The Dao of Heaven and Earth’s ascending and descending,
The cycles of the sun and moon’s coming and going,
Are practiced as **inner elixir** (*nèidān*).
**Yellow Emperor** (*Huángdì*) followed it, but long labored without success—
His **root and foundation were not firm** (*gēnyuán bùgù yǐ*).
Thus, he **paired with metals and stones** (*pèihé jīnshí*) on **Mount Kongtong** (*Kōngtóng shān*), crafting **outer elixir** (*wàidān*).
**Inner elixir** (*nèidān*) is the **true medicine** (*zhēnyào*);
**Outer elixir** (*wàidān*) is merely for **treating ailments** (*zhìjí*).
The **beginning of inner elixir** (*nèidān zhī shǐ*) originates from the **two *qi*s’ union** (*èrqì jiāo*).
Its **congealing and forming** (*níngjié*) occurs in the **elixir field** (*Dāntián*).
It **transforms essence into mercury** (*jiāng jīng wéi gǒng*), mercury into **sand** (*shā*), and sand into **elixir** (*dān*).
Thus, **true *qi*** (*zhēnqì*) is born, **refining *qi* with *qi*** (*qì liàn qì*), *qi* merging and **spirit gathering** (*shén jù*).
When **spirit gathers** (*shén jù*), the **Dao is complete** (*dàochéng yǐ*).
How can it compare with **outer elixir** (*wàidān*)?
Thus, my **elixir** (*dān*) is when the **dragon joins the tiger** (*lóng jiāo hǔ*), forming the **mysterious pearl** (*xuánzhū*).
The **fire’s timing is without error** (*huǒhòu wú chā*), and it becomes the **great medicine** (*dàyào*)."*

Guangchengzi refined cinnabar (*zhūshā*), nine transformations yielding **divine elixir** (*shéndān*).
Chen Qizi refined it with **seven treasures’ cinnabar** (*qībǎo dānshā*), nine transformations yielding **spiritual elixir** (*língdān*).
Liu An refined it with **boy’s urine** (*tóngbiàn*), seven transformations yielding **returning elixir** (*huándān*).
These are all **external elixirs** (*wàidān*).
Yet, one must cultivate **inner alchemy** (*nèidān*) concurrently—only when both inner and outer are perfected does true mastery arise.
If one relies solely on **external medicines** (*wàiyào*), then *qi* weakens and spirit decays, unable to retain **Heaven and Earth’s refined *qi*** (*tiāndì zhī xiùqì*), instead becoming a harm.

This is what I call **true elixir medicine** (*zhēndānyào*).

At the beginning of humanity, the **kidneys** (*shèn*) are born first, then the **heart** (*xīn*).
The kidneys are **northern *wu* and *guǐ*** (*běifāng rénɡuǐ*)—**water** (*shuǐ*), among the five metals as **lead** (*qiān*).
The heart is **southern *bǐng* and *dīng*** (*nánfāng bǐngdīng*)—**fire** (*huǒ*), among the eight stones as **cinnabar** (*shā*).
To extract lead from silver is like extracting **true One’s water** (*zhēnyī zhī shuǐ*) hidden in the depths of kidney *qi*!
To extract mercury from cinnabar is like extracting **true Yang’s *qi*** (*zhēngyáng zhī qì*) hidden in the depths of heart *qi*!
When these two merge, elixir is formed.

Thus, **kidney *qi* generates *qi***, *qi* generates water—with kidney water ascending to the **heart-kidney junction** (*xīnshèn zhī shàng*), causing **true Yang’s *qi*** to congeal in the **Yellow Court** (*Huángtíng*), this is **true lead** (*zhēnqiān*).
Kidney *qi* merging with heart *qi*, accumulated *qi* forming fluid, congealing into the **mysterious pearl** (*xuánzhū*), returning to the **lower elixir field** (*xià dāntián*), this is **mercury** (*gǒng*).
Once the elixir is complete, **true *qi*** ascends—kidney *qi* enters the **crown** (*dǐng*), and **true water** descends.
One ascent, one descent before the **twelve pavilions** (*shíèr lóu*), this is the **completed cycle** (*jìjié zhī dào*).
After completion, it returns to the lower elixir field—this is **true mercury** (*zhēngǒng*).
This is what I call **true lead and mercury** (*zhēnqiān gǒng*).

The kidneys are **water**—water generates *qi*, named **true fire** (*zhēnhuǒ*).
Within *qi* hides **true One’s water**—for **yin contains yang**, and **yang contains yin**.
The heart is **fire**—fire generates fluid, named **true water** (*zhēnshuǐ*).
Within fluid hides **true Yang’s *qi***—for **yang contains yin**, and **yin contains yang**.

The **three blossoms** (*sānhuā*) are the **three Yangs** (*sānyáng*).
Kidney *qi* is **yang within yin**.
True *qi* within the elixir is **yang within true yang**.
Heart fluid’s *qi* is **yang within yang**.

The essence of the **Way** lies in **yin exhaustion and pure yang** (*yínjìn ér chún yáng*).
*The Sacred Embryo Key* (*Shèngtāi Jué*) says:
*"Lower the heart-fire to the elixir field—external distractions vanish, mad thoughts dissolve.
When one *qi* gathers at the **sea of *qi*** (*qìhǎi*), kidney *qi* cannot ascend, and breathing grows sparse.
Even if released, it lingers faintly.
Thus, **embryonic breathing** (*tāixī*) is natural—how profound!"*

Damo’s words say:
*"Human *qi* daily dissipates—better to internally observe all worlds within the body’s **celestial offices** (*tiānguān*), transcending the **pure and empty** (*qīngxū*) realm.
The noble path is **non-leakage** (*wúlòu*).
Thus, when not a thought arises, not a mind moves, and not a hair’s breadth of *qi* is lost—this is **true embryonic breathing** (*zhēntāixī*)."*

Bian Que’s commentary on *The Spiritual Pivot* (*Língshū*) says:
*"After Winter Solstice, accumulate **one part lead** (*qiān*), shaped like a **playful flower bud** (*xìruǐ*), to settle in the elixir field.
The method: inhale **clear *qi*** (*qīngqì*) through the nose, close the mouth without exhaling, and regulate breath for **twenty-four counts** (*shù*), yielding **one *liang* of fire** (*huǒ*).
In **forty-five days**, fire advances to **sixteen *liang*—thus, the **Yang Embryo** (*yángtāi*) is refined.
After Summer Solstice, accumulate **three parts mercury** (*gǒng*), shaped like an **embryo in an egg** (*bàoluǎn*), to settle in the **vermilion field** (*jiàngguān*).
Again, inhale clear *qi* through the nose, close the mouth without exhaling, regulate breath for twenty-four counts, yielding one *liang* of fire.
In forty-five days, fire advances to sixteen *liang*—thus, **Yin Breath** (*yīnxī*) is refined.
Merge **Yin Breath** into the **Yang Embryo**, generating **true *qi***, which generates **original spirit** (*yuánshén*).
When spirit and form unite as one, one aligns with **Heaven and Earth’s lifespan** (*tiāndì qīnián*).
Separated into two, the body has a body beyond—returning to the **Three Isles, Ten Zous** (*sān dǎo shí zhōu*) above."*

Ge Hong’s commentary on embryonic breathing says:
*"If one does not grasp embryonic breathing’s subtlety, even if breath is closed, it will soon escape.
Unceasing panting not only fails to retain the closed breath but also depletes **original *qi*** (*yuánqì*), letting incoming **Yang *qi*** (*lái yángqì*) seize it instead.
If breath is urgent before urgency arises, one can ascend the body to pause briefly.
Do not force it—first, inhale *qi* through the nose, then follow with newly drawn breath, expelling the lingering residue of the forcibly retained breath.
Thus, one can seize and accumulate *qi*—when form and spirit grow luminous and pure, all ailments depart.
Yet, forcibly retaining breath is not natural—this is the **lower form** (*xià*) of embryonic breathing.
Others practice **swallowing breath** (*yànqì*) to relieve hunger and thirst,
**circulating *qi*** (*xíngqì*) to strengthen the body,
**gathering *qi*** (*shōuqì*) to nourish the lower elixir field,
**nurturing *qi*** (*yǎngqì*) to restore youth,
**moving *qi*** (*yùnqì*) to benefit blood vessels—
none compare to embryonic breathing’s **qi-nourishing power** (*bǔqì*).

When **one hundred breaths** (*bǎixī*) are steadied, the **passages open** (*guāntōng*), and illness departs.
When **one thousand breaths** are steadied, *qi* and blood no longer mingle, and **yin and yang harmonize** (*yīnyáng zìhé*).
When **ten thousand breaths** are steadied, *qi* halts and spirit is concealed—then the **Way is complete** (*dào sīchéng*).
This is what I call **true yin and yang** (*zhēnyīnyáng*).

In the past, when **Yang *qi*** arose after Winter Solstice and **residual cold** entered the intestines after Spring Equinox, causing **injury by cold** (*shānghán*), one would reside in a **quiet chamber** (*jìngshì*), sit cross-legged, close the eyes, quiet the mind, regulate breath and retain *qi*, alternating hands to cradle the **external kidneys** (*wàishèn*), bowing forward as in prostration—**twenty to thirty repetitions** (*guò*), and sweat would emerge, dispersing the cold.

In the past, when the **lower elixir root** (*xiàyuán*) was empty and **semen leakage** (*mèngxièlòu*) occurred in dreams, one would, after sunset, sit quietly in a secluded room, cradle the external kidneys with the hands, and rub **eighty-one times** below the navel, alternating hands to pull—**nine repetitions** (*jiǔ guò*), and the **elixir root would warm** (*dānyuán nuǎn*), while **true *qi*** would fill (*zhēnqì yíng*)."

「。
　　In the past, there were those who dwelled in seclusion and sat quietly, severing thoughts and forgetting speech, lowering the **fire of the heart** (*xīn huǒ*) to the **elixir field** (*dāntián*). With eyes closed, they **visualized** (*cúnxiǎng*) the fire as if it were a furnace, its heat building day by day. Then, the **sea of *qi*** (*qìhǎi*) would solidify and the complexion would grow radiant, all impurities would descend, and they would overcome both cold and heat.

　　When one had overindulged in food and drink, causing **stagnation in the chest** (*xiōngyì*), or if **cold and heat** were congealed and **painful obstructions** (*tòngjié yōngsè*) formed, they would sit quietly and **inhale the pure *qi*** (*qīngqì*) through the nose, keeping the mouth closed, inhaling deeply and exhaling shallowly, to **assault the illness** (*gōng bìng*). If the breath became too constrained, they would release it. **Three to five repetitions** (*sān-wǔ guò*), and the ailment would vanish.

　　In the past, some held that the **upper heart** (*xīn zhī shàng*) as **yang**, yet **yin** could not reach it; and the **lower kidneys** (*shèn zhī xià*) as **yin**, yet **yang** could not extend to them. Thus, above the **gushing spring** (*yǒngquán*), *qi* would ascend but not descend, blood would stagnate but not rise, and **yin would congeal while yang dispersed**, causing **heaviness in the legs and knees** (*zúxī chénzhòng*). In such cases, they would **lift both feet high**, allowing *qi* to flow downward into the gushing spring, ascending through the **elixir gate** (*dānyuè*). Then, the legs would grow light and the illness would diminish.

　　When the **four limbs and five viscera** (*sìzhī wǔzàng*) were congealed and obstructed, they would sit quietly, **clarify the mind** (*chéngxīn*), close their eyes, sever thoughts, and **circulate the heart-*qi*** (*yùnxīnqì*) to assault the illness. After retaining the breath for a short time, their assault would surely prevail.

　　These are all **methods** (*fǎ*), but none compare to the **Dao of yin and yang** (*yīyīn yīyáng zhī dào*).

　　Know that in a single day:
　　At the end of **Chǒu** (2:00–4:00 AM) and the beginning of **Hài** (7:00–9:00 PM), **yang unites with yin** (*yáng hé yīn*).
　　At the end of **Chén** (7:00–9:00 AM) and the beginning of **Wèi** (9:00 AM–12:00 PM), **yang unites with yang** (*yáng jiāo yáng*).
　　At the end of **Wǔ** (12:00–2:00 PM) and the beginning of **Shēn** (5:00–7:00 PM), **yin unites with yang** (*yīn hé yáng*).
　　At the end of **Xū** (5:00–7:00 PM) and the beginning of **Hài** (7:00–9:00 PM), **yin unites with yin** (*yīn jiāo yīn*).

　　Those who know this understand that the **Dao is not distant**. This is what I call **refining methods to enter the Dao** (*liànfǎ rùdào*).

　　The **form** (*xíng*) is the dwelling of *qi*; *qi* is the master of the form. Thus, refining the form requires **true *qi*** (*zhēnqì*).

　　The **Master Peng** (*Péng Zhēnrén*) said: Before **Wǔ** (12:00–2:00 PM), refine the **dryness** (*gān*); after **Wǔ**, refine the **earthiness** (*kūn*). From **Yín** (3:00–5:00 AM) to **Wǔ**, one should **elevate the body** (*shēngshēn*) and sit quietly, close the eyes, and forget speech, making the nasal breath slow and steady. **Secretly visualize** (*mìxiǎng*) the **heart palace** (*xīn gōng*) as if it were the **rituals of husband and wife** (*fūfù zhī yí*), and with time, **longevity** (*chángshēng*) would come.

　　The **Original True Person** (*Yuán Zhēnrén*), surnamed **Fáng** (*Fáng*), said: From **Chén** (7:00–9:00 AM) onward, one should rise without speaking, and with their tongue, **stir the saliva** (*jǐo*) in the **upper jaw** (*shàngkuà*), **lower palate** (*xiàjiāo*), and **filthy, turbid fluids** (*èzú zhī jīn*), swallowing it. Afterward, one would **expel the accumulated *qi* of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight** (*xīn zhōng suǒ jī fèn-āo lè zhī qì*) with a **forceful exhalation** (*hē*), allowing **true *qi*** to rise and dwell in the **face and eyes** (*miànmù*), then **rub it with the hands** (*yǒngshǒu cuōzhī*). By **Wǔ** to **Wèi** (2:00–4:00 PM), when *qi* was abundant and the spirit **dazed** (*shén yīng*), they would **lie on their side with mouth closed** (*cèwài bìkǒu ér mèi*), which could **prolong life** (*yánnián*) and **preserve the form** (*liúxíng*). This is the knowledge of **union times** (*jiāohé shíhòu*), yet they still did not know the **method of gathering** (*cǎiqǔ zhī fǎ*).

　　From **Zǐ** (9:00–11:00 PM) to **Wǔ** (12:00–2:00 PM) is the time when *qi* **generates** (*shēngqì*), and one can use it to **gather *qi* and return to the elixir** (*jùqì huándān*). At **Zǐ**’s time, **kidney-*qi* generates**; at **Mǎo**’s time (5:00–7:00 AM), **liver-*qi* generates**. By **Wǔ**’s time, **kidney-*qi* unites with heart-*qi***, accumulating *qi* to form **elixir fluid** (*huándān*), returning to the **elixir field** (*dāntián*). This is the **medicine of the mysterious pearl for longevity** (*Xuán Zhū Chángshēng zhī yào*).

　　How does one ensure it does not **dissipate** (*bù zǒushī*)? When the time is between **Chén** and **Wèi** (7:00–9:00 AM), one should sit quietly in seclusion, **guard the spirit inwardly** (*shénshí nèishǒu*), fill the mouth with saliva, neither swallowing nor spitting it out. The nasal breath should **enter slightly and be expelled gently** (*shǎo rù yùn chū*), **soft and lingering** (*miánmián ruòcún*), naturally allowing the **two *qi*** (*èrqì*) to unite and congeal like dew. After **one hundred days** (*bǎi rì*), the **drug’s efficacy is complete** (*yàolì quán*); after **two hundred days** (*èr bǎi rì*), the **holy embryo** (*shèngtāi*) is firm; after **three hundred days** (*sān bǎi rì*), the **embryo attains transcendence** (*tāixiān quán*), and **true *qi* is born** (*zhēnqì shēng*). *Qi* within *qi* can be **refined to become spirit** (*liànqì chéngshén*).

　　This is the **method of gathering *qi*** (*cǎiqì zhī fǎ*). From **Wǔ** to **Zǐ** is the time when *qi* **disperses** (*sànqì*), and one can use it to **harvest *qi* and refine the elixir** (*shōuqì liàndān*).

　　**Twenty-four breaths** (*èrshísì xī*) constitute **one *liǎng* of fire** (*huǒ yī liǎng*). After the **summer solstice** (*xiàzhì*), using the **Xùn (巽) hexagram**, the **celestial mist movement** (*tiānyùn zhī yùn*), **twenty-five repetitions** (*èrshíwǔ guò*), one would refine **true mercury** (*zhēn gǒng*) into the **yin embryo** (*yīn tāi*).
　　After the **winter solstice** (*dōngzhì*), using the **Qián (乾) hexagram**, the **numinous symbol movement** (*língfú zhī yùn*), **two thousand five hundred repetitions** (*èrqiān wǔbǎi guò*), one would refine **true lead** (*zhēn qiān*) into the **yang breath** (*yáng xī*).

　　The **yang breath** is cast into the **yin embryo**; thus, it **transforms into the golden elixir** (*biànchéng jīndān*).

　　The **Broad Achiever** (*Guǎngchéng Zǐ*) instructed **Yellow Emperor** (*Huángdì*):

　　From **Chén** (7:00–9:00 AM) to **Mù** (7:00–9:00 PM), one should sit quietly, forget thoughts, and **guard the spirit inwardly** (*shénshí nèishǒu*), maintaining **a single undivided intention** (*yīyì bùsàn*). They would **lower the fire of the heart** into the **elixir field** (*dāntián*), visualizing below the navel as if **contending for a vessel** (*rú zhēng píng*). Within, there is a **pearl-like formation** (*zhū zhuàng*) as round as a **marble** (*dànwán*), which they would **forge with blazing fire** (*yòng yānyān zhī huǒ*), day and night. Until the **embryo is formed and the breath is still** (*tāi chéng xī zhù*), naturally, there would be **no hunger nor thirst** (*bù jī bù kě*), **no cold nor heat** (*wú hán wú shǔ*), and one could **preserve the form and attain longevity** (*liúxíng chángshēng*). This is merely **advancing the fire at the right time** (*jìn huǒ dé shí*), not the **method of the Eastern Breath** (*Dōngqì zhī fǎ*).

　　At the end of **Xū** (5:00–7:00 PM) and the beginning of **Hài** (7:00–9:00 PM), when *qi* follows the **true fluid** in returning to the elixir, **yin unites with yin** (*yīn jiāo yīn*), and the *qi* **desires to disperse** (*yù sàn*). One should then reside in a **quiet chamber** (*jìngshì*), and the breath need not be **retained** (*bì*). A **slight inhalation and gentle exhalation** (*shǎo rù yùn chū*) suffices. When the **fire of the heart descends** into the **elixir field**, the **kidney-*qi* ascends without stopping** (*shènqì shēng ér bù tíng*), and the **heart-fire descends without lingering** (*xīn huǒ jiàng ér bù zhù*). One would then **lightly press the sides of the abdomen** (*qīngxié qí fù*), allowing the **elixir field to warm naturally** (*dāntián zì rè*), which could refine the **medicine gathered during the day** (*rì zhōng suǒ dé zhī yào*).

　　Initially, after **one hundred days** (*bǎi rì*), one would use the **Qián (乾) hexagram**; in the **next hundred days** (*cì zhī bǎi rì*), from **Duì (兑)** to **Qián (乾)**...

「Next hundred days, from **Kūn (坤)** to **Qián (乾)**. When **Qián (乾)** and **Kūn (坤)** meet, the **fire and timing** (*huǒ hòu*) require no adjustment—whether by **shouting to draw** (*jiàn*), **extracting to supplement** (*chōu tiān*), or **adding to harmonize** (*tiān*), all suit their purpose. After the **elbow** (*shǒu*), the **golden crystal ascends** (*fēi jīn jīng*).

Thus, the ancient **Sages of High Dao** (*gǔ xiān shàngshèng*) gathered **medicine** (*yào*) at **Lí (离)**, then **entered fire** (*jìn huǒ*) at **Qián (乾)**. Within **one to two hundred days** (*yī èr bǎi rì*), the **inner elixir** (*nèidān*) was formed. This is what I call **refining the form and transforming the *qi*** (*liàn xíng huà qì*).

To refine the *qi* with the form, the form must then transform the *qi*—thus the body and bones become **light and agile** (*tǐgǔ qīngjiàn*), allowing one to **enter water without drowning** (*rù shuǐ bù nì*) and **enter fire without burning** (*rù huǒ bù rè*). Hence, it is **refining the *qi* with the spirit** (*yǐ shén liàn qì*), where refining the *qi* nurtures the spirit (*liàn qì chéng shén*). This does not depend on **the union of yang and yin** (*yáng jiāo yīn huì*), but rather on **extracting lead and adding mercury** (*chōu qiān tiān gǒng*), **dissolving the twenty-eight yin** (*xiāo èr bā zhī yīn*), and **changing bones to refine form** (*huàn gǔ liàn xíng*), thereby **prolonging the nine-three yang** (*cháng jiǔ sān zhī yáng*).

After **three hundred days**, the **embryo of the Immortal** (*tāi xiān*) is complete, and **true *qi*** (*zhēn qì*) arises—**no further gathering of medicine** (*bù kě zài cǎi yào*) is needed. Only after the **elbow**, when the **golden crystal ascends** (*jīn jīng rù nǎo*), does it rise from the **kidney’s posterior interval** (*shèn zhī hòu wěi jiān*) to the **intervertebral space** (*jiā jǐ*), then from the **intervertebral space** to the **double gate** (*shuāng guān*), and finally to the **Upper Palace** (*shàng gōng*). It is not merely **supplementing the brain with kidney-*qi*** (*bù zhǐ yú shèn qì bǔ nǎo*).

At **midday**, the **true fire descends** (*jiàng zhēn huǒ*) to refine the elixir, **consummating yin to achieve pure yang** (*zhì yīn jìn yáng chún*).

From **Zǐ (子)** onward, when **kidney-*qi* first stirs** (*shèn qì fāng shēng*), one sits upright in a **quiet chamber** (*jìng shì*), **calms the mind** (*qīng xīn*), **closes the eyes** (*bì mù*), and **contracts the body** (*yǎn shēn*), allowing the **kidney-*qi* to gather naturally** (*shèn zhī qì zì jù*).

**Slightly raising the body** (*wēi shēng qí shēn*), **lowering the chest and straightening the waist** (*yǎn xióng zhí yāo*), one first reaches the **intervertebral space** (*jiā jǐ*), then the **Upper Palace** (*shàng gōng*). From **Zǐ (子)** to **Chén (辰)** and **Sì (巳)**, one **stabilizes at one hundred breaths** (*dìng yú bǎi xī*), **striking the three gates** (*yī zhuàng sān guān*), and **reaccumulating the true fire of the heart** (*fú jī xīn zhī zhēn huǒ*), **forging and refining the inner elixir of the Lower Yuan** (*duàn liàn yú xià yuán zhī nèi dān*). Thus, **yin solidifies and yang condenses** (*yīn gù ér yáng níng*).

Within the *qi* lies another *qi*—**the front ascends into the crown** (*qián shēng rù yú dǐng*), **the back enters into the brain** (*hòu qǐ rù yú nǎo*). When both **arise simultaneously** (*qián hòu jù qǐ*), one **raises the body without movement** (*shēng shēn wù dòng*), **burning the body** (*yán qí shēn*), and **driving away the yin demons** (*zhú yīn guǐ*).

Thus, **one burn refines one *qi*** (*yī shāo ér zēng yī qì*), **ten burns refine one spirit** (*shí shāo ér zēng yī shén*), **a hundred burns extend ten thousand years** (*bǎi shāo ér yán wàn nián*), and **a thousand burns transcend the mortal world** (*qiān shāo ér chū chén shì*).

The ancient **Sages of High Dao** (*gǔ xiān shàngshèng*) feared **excessive fire** (*huǒ zhī tài guò*), so they devised the **method of dousing and irrigating** (*jiāo guàn zhī fǎ*).

The first stage of **gathering medicine** (*cǎi yào*) is **returning the elixir with jade fluid** (*yù liào huán dān*). The next stage, after the **elbow**, is **the golden crystal entering the brain** (*jīn jīng rù nǎo*), where **it travels from the Upper Field to the Lower Field** (*zì shàng tián rù yú xià tián*), **collecting the two gaps** (*shuāng shōu èr jiā*), **swallowing hollowly to absorb the *qi*** (*xū yàn nà qì*), and **returning the elixir with golden fluid** (*jīn yè huán dān*).

Once the elixir is complete and **true *qi*** (*zhēn qì*) arises, one **refines the *qi* of the five viscera** (*yǐ zhēn qì liàn qí wǔ zàng zhī qì*). Only **a slight breath adjustment** (*yī xiǎo yùn*) is needed daily—**closing the breath to refine the *qi*** (*bì xī liàn qì*). On **Jia (甲) and Yi (乙)**, one refines the **liver-*qi*** (*gān*); on **Bing (丙) and Ding (丁)**, the **heart-*qi*** (*xīn*); on **Wù (戊) and Jǐ (己)**, the **spleen-*qi*** (*pí*); on **Gēng (庚) and Xīn (辛)**, the **lung-*qi*** (*fèi*); and on **Rén (壬) and Guǐ (癸)**, one refines the **kidney-*qi*** (*shèn*), as detailed in the **Scriptures of Soul Treasures** (*Língbǎo Piān zhōng*).

Refining the *qi* **once every ten days** (*shí rì yī liàn*), **through all five viscera** (*biàn yú wǔ zàng*), **two hundred and fifty days** (*èr bǎi wǔ shí rì*) for each **twenty-five refinements** (*èr shí wǔ shù*), then **true *qi* naturally gathers** (*zhēn qì zì jù*).

Then, the **River Vehicle** (*Hé Chē*) is opened, adorned with **five-colored objects** (*wǔ cǎi zhī wù*), where **the pipes and flutes** (*shēng huáng*) and **vehicle flags** (*chē qí*) each divide into their proper directions. One **ascends to the Imperial Gate** (*shàng cháo yú dì què*), **entering the Celestial Palace** (*rù yú tiān gōng*). Sometimes, **obstructing demons or spirits** (*xié mó wéi gěng*) arise, so one **dons the robe** (*pī yī*), returns to the **quiet chamber** (*jìng shì*), **closes the eyes** (*bì mù*), **plunges the mind into emptiness** (*míng xīn*), and **raises the body to sit upright** (*shēng shēn zhèng zuò*). Then, the **true fire of the threefold concentration** (*sān měi zhī zhēn huǒ*) naturally arises, and the **spirits disperse** (*mó sàn*).

One’s form **constantly seems to soar and fly** (*qí xíng cháng ruò téng fēi*), allowing the use of **the method of adjusting the spirit to emerge from the shell** (*yòng tiáo shén chū ké zhī fǎ*).

This is what I call **refining the *qi* to achieve the spirit** (*liàn qì chéng shén*).

When the *qi* is full and the practice complete, **the five *qi* converge at the Yuan** (*wǔ qì cháo yú yuán*), and **the three flowers gather at the crown** (*sān huā jù yú dǐng*). With **blood congealed and *qi* gathered** (*xuè níng qì jù*), **all spirits bow to the true** (*wàn shén cháo zhēn*), residing in the **Upper Palace** (*shàng gōng*). What one **perceives in splendor and wealth** (*qí suǒ jiàn fùguì huá shèng*) is still **oneself** (*yóu wú shēn ér*), yet if one **remains trapped within the inner precincts** (*yīn yuàn*), **hesitating to emerge** (*yīn xún bù chū*), one is **ensnared in the dim crossroads** (*shì wéi kùn yú hūn qiú*).

The **method of emerging from the shell** (*chū ké zhī fǎ*) I have mastered in **three forms** (*sān yán*).

**Hǎi Chán Zǐ** (*海蟾子*) says: When the **yang spirit seeks to emerge** (*yáng shén yù chū*), it **resides in the Upper Palace** (*fāng zài shàng guān*), yet in the **quiet chamber**, one **sits alone** (*gū zuò*), like a **crane emerging from the Celestial Gate** (*hè chū tiān mén*), a **dragon ascending its old lair** (*lóng shēng jiù xué*), **boldly striking the Celestial Gate and departing** (*měng zhuàng tiān mén ér qù*).

**Zhèng Yáng Zǐ** (*正阳子*) says: In **quiet sitting and inward observation** (*jìng zuò nèi guān*), one **ascends the seven-tiered Treasure Platform** (*rú dēng qī jí bǎo tái*), from **below to above** (*zì xià ér shàng*). When the tiers are exhausted, one **closes the eyes and leaps downward** (*bì mù xià tiào*), like **one awakening from a dream** (*rú mèng zhōng fāng qǐ*), where **a body exists beyond the body** (*shēn wài yǒu shēn*). **Do not wander far** (*wù dé yuǎn yóu*), but **quickly return to the corporeal form** (*jí huán qí qū*). **Entering without emerging** (*rù ér bù chū*), one **aligns with Heaven and Earth** (*yú tiān dì qí yì*); **emerging without entering** (*chū ér bù rù*), one **becomes like the vulgar** (*yú sú tóng yì*).

**Chún Yáng Zǐ** (*纯阳子*) says: As **Zhèng Yáng Zǐ’s method** (*Zhèng Yáng Zǐ zhī fǎ*), in **inward observation of the Purple River Vehicle** (*nèi guān zǐ hé zhī chē*), one **transports the spirit into the Celestial Palace** (*bān shén rù yú tiān guān*). If one **lingers and cannot transcend** (*liú liàn ér bù néng chāo chū*), then the **true fire is kindled within** (*qǐ zhēn huǒ yú qí zhōng*), **transforming into the Fire Dragon** (*huà huǒ lóng*), which **leaps forth from the dim crossroads** (*yuè chū yú hūn qiú*). This is the **wondrous art of abandoning the shell** (*nǎi qì chū ké zhī miào zhě*).

If, in **meditation** (*dìng zhōng*), one **emerges with the yin spirit and cannot return** (*chū qí yīn shén ér bù néng fǎn*), it is called **corpse dissolution** (*shī jiě*), **not the Dao** (*fēi dào*).

This is what I call **refining the spirit to unite with the Dao** (*liàn shén hé dào*).

Once the practice is complete and the spirit **transmigrates** (*shén qiān*), having **already abandoned the shell** (*yǐ qì qí ké*), one must still **accumulate virtuous deeds in the world** (*jī xíng yú shì*). When these deeds are fulfilled and the practice complete, one **receives the Purple Edict and Celestial Scripture** (*shòu zǐ zhào tiān shū*), and **resides in the Cavernous Heaven** (*jū dòng tiān*).

This is what I call **refining the Dao to attain sainthood** (*liàn dào rù shèng*).

*(End of Volume Thirty-Eight of the Dao Gun Scroll #1—originally "他" [tā], corrected to "佗" [tuō] according to the Jí Yào edition. Volume Thirty-Nine of the Dao Gun Scroll follows.)*

**Transmission of the Dao: Upper Section**

When the Mysterious Pass is opened, the Dao has no lingering residue;
Dark and profound, vast indeed is the question!

Master Lü studied the Dao, consulting over seventy teachers,
before encountering Master Zhōnglí from the Zhōnglí lineage.

He often asked Master Zhōnglí:
*"How does one live without illness, remain strong without aging,
and live without dying?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"The two *qi*—yin and yang—combine to form a person.
At the moment of the embryo’s formation,
after the Primordial Origin, there is the Great Essence (*tài zhì*).
Yin supports yang to generate life,
*qi* transforms from the embryo,
and after thirty *xún* (decades), its form is complete.
The spirit-light enters,
and it first emerges from the embryo.

After the Great Substance (*tài sù*) appears,
the cycles of ascent and descent begin.
The yellow sprout grows for five hundred *xún*—its *qi* is then full—
and its span reaches eighty-one.
Some say it is eight hundred and ten *zhàng* (feet).

At fifteen years of age,
within yin, its yang is half spent—
like the first light of dawn,
the ignorant do not cherish it,
losing their Primordial Yang (*yuán yáng*)
until their decline—
is this not the reverse of the sun’s path?

If one wishes as you say—
to take the Dao from humanity and attain sainthood,
and from sainthood attain the Heavenly—
then Master Lü asked:
*"Sainthood is singular—why speak of attaining the Heavenly?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"The purely yin is called *guǐ* (ghost).
The purely yang is called sainthood (*xiān*).
The mingling of yin and yang is humanity—
only humanity can become a *guǐ* or a sainthood.
Sainthood is not singular.

Its ranks are five;
its methods are three.
Five ranks:
1. The sainthood of *guǐ* (ghosts),
2. the sainthood of humanity,
3. the sainthood of Earth,
4. the sainthood of Spirits,
5. the sainthood of Heaven.

Three methods:
1. The lesser vehicle (*xiǎo chéng*),
2. the middle vehicle (*zhōng chéng*),
3. the greater vehicle (*dà chéng*).

Master Lü asked:
*"What is the sainthood of *guǐ*?
How is it achieved?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"Those who do not grasp the Great Dao yet seek swift success—
their bodies wither like dead wood,
their minds grow cold like ashes,
their spirit and consciousness retreat inward,
and their *qi* does not disperse.
In meditation, they emit their yin spirit—
thus, they become the pure and refined *guǐ*.

Beyond the yin, their spirit-forms are indistinct,
with nowhere to rest,
only to return to a human womb
and take residence there."*

Master Lü asked:
*"What is the sainthood of humanity?
How is it achieved?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"In the Dao, there are methods—
some attain one aspect.
Those who abstain from the Five Flavors
do not know the Two *Qi*;
those who forget the Seven Emotions
do not know the Ten Precepts.
Those who practice spitting and swallowing (*sǒu yàn*)
despise inhalation and exhalation;
those who gather and refine (*cǎi bǔ*)
mock purity and tranquility;
those who seize *qi* from things
do not know the art of rejecting grains (*pìgǔ*);
those who cultivate through visualization
do not know the method of adjusting and guiding (*àn yáo*);
those who rigidly hold their breath
do not know the art of natural breathing.
Their resolve is fixed—
the sequence of the Four Seasons cannot change,
the *qi* of the Five Phases loses its harmony—
though they preserve their physical form,
ward off the Eight Evils (*bā xié*),
they only delay death.

Master Lü asked:
*"What is the sainthood of Earth?
How is it achieved?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"Follow the principles of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent,
take the numbers of the sun and moon’s generation and completion.
Within the body, apply the year;
within the year, apply the month;
within the month, apply the day;
within the day, apply the hour;
within the hour, apply the moment (*kè*).

Thus, one discerns the Dragon and Tiger,
grasps the Kan and Lí,
knows the purity and turbidity of the Water Source,
distinguishes the early and late of *qi* and climate,
collects the True One while observing the Two Principles,
arranges the Three Talents while distinguishing the Four Symbols,
examines the Six Circulations while stabilizing the Six *Qi*,
gathers the Seven Treasures while sequencing the Eight Trigrams,
and practices the Nine Regions while reversing the Five Phases.
The reversal means inversion.

*Qi* is transmitted through parent-child cycles,
fluids circulate through husband-wife cycles.
Through repeated refinement, the Three Fields are burned,
and the Lower Field (*xià tián*) is settled as the Dan Field.
Thus, one can refine the form and prolong life."*

Master Lü asked:
*"What is the sainthood of Spirits?
How is it achieved?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"What I call the sainthood of Earth—
if one perseveres in its practice,
so that the Three Passes and Hundred Nodes are harmoniously connected,
and one draws out and augments the lead and mercury (*yīn yáng*),
then the golden essence is refined in the Nine Heavens—
the Nine Heavens, the vertex.
The jade fluid returns to the elixir—
thus, one refines the form and *qi*,
and the Five *Qi* pay homage to the Primordial.
The Three Yangs converge in the Primordial Palace (*yuán gōng*),
and yin is exhausted, becoming purely yang."*

Master Lü asked:
*"What is the sainthood of Heaven?
How is it achieved?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"In the Dao, one has attained merit;
in deeds toward humanity, one has cultivated virtue.
Thus, one returns to the Cavernous Heaven (*dòng tiān*),
ascends to the Three Officials (*sān guān*),
the Upper being the Heavenly Official (*tiān guān*),
the Middle being the Earthly Official (*dì guān*),
the Lower being the Water Official (*shuǐ guān*).
In one’s heart, toward Heaven and Earth, one has great merit;
toward the past and present, one has great virtue.

Those who traverse the Cavernous Heaven number thirty-six;
those who reach the Yang Heaven number eighty-one.
Then one ascends to the Three Pure Ones (*sān qīng*)."*

Master Lü, thus enlightened, asked:
*"The sainthood of *guǐ* is unattainable,
the sainthood of Heaven is not to be dared—
excluding these two, can the Dao be heard?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied:
*"The sainthood of humanity has three ranks:
The highest prolongs the years and increases longevity,
the next attains peace while prolonging the years,
and the lowest attains peace without illness—
all are lesser vehicles.

The sainthood of Earth has three ranks:
The highest achieves extreme yang and lightens the body,
soaring freely at will;
the next refines the form and extends vision,
reaching a thousand years;
the lowest prolongs the years and increases longevity—
all are middle vehicles.

The sainthood of Spirits has three ranks:
The highest transcends the mundane and enters sainthood,
returning to the Three Isles (*sān dǎo*);
the next refines the spirit to unite with the Dao (*liàn shén hé dào*),
entering and exiting naturally;
the lowest refines the form and *qi*,
so that one day, ancient and enduring, they persist—
all are greater vehicles.*

Master Lü asked:
*"Examining the ancient and modern cultivators of life,
many seek but do not attain—why is this?"*

The Master Zhōnglí said:
*"This is not in accord with the Dao/Way. Many hear much and remember strongly,
yet they derive from mere side-paths and minor techniques.
Sainthood? Sainthood? How can it be achieved by mere hearing and remembering?"*

Master Lü asked:
*"May I inquire about the true essence of the Great Dao/Way?"*

The Master Zhōnglí said:
*"It is formless, nameless, beyond knowing, and beyond practice (#1: *行* here likely refers to deliberate cultivation or action)."*

Master Lü asked:
*"When scholars first learn the Dao/Way,
then possess the Dao/Way,
then hear of the Dao/Way,
and finally achieve Dao/Way-completion—
yet it is said to be beyond knowing, beyond practice—
does this not imply it is hidden from them?"*

The Master Zhōnglí said:
*"I have no hidden teachings.
Scholars hear of the Great Dao/Way yet lack faith,
or have faith yet lack resolute aspiration—
thus, it is difficult to know and difficult to practice."*

Now, the side-path minor techniques—there are thirty distinct kinds:
They are called fasting and abstinence (*zhāi jiè*),
avoiding grains (*bì gǔ*),
refining *qi*,
gargling and swallowing (*sǒu yàn*),
cutting off internal desires (*jué nèi*),
abandoning flavors (*duàn wèi*),
meditative stillness (*chán dìng*),
silent contemplation of the Mysterious (*xuán mò bù yǔ*),
visualization (*cún xiǎng*),
harvesting yin (*cǎi yīn*),
ingesting *qi* (*fú qì*),
friction and massage (*chí mó*),
calming the mind (*xī xīn*),
removing burdens (*qù lěi*),
opening the crown (*kāi dǐng*),
shrinking the turtle (*suō guī*),
severing the edges (*jué biān*),
chanting and recitation (*luò sòng kàn dú*),
burning and refining (*shāo liàn*),
consolidating breath (*gù xī*),
pressing and coaxing (*àn jiāo*),
spitting and inhaling (*tǔ nà*),
harvesting and supplementing (*cǎi bǔ*),
broadly giving and liberally offering (*bó shī jiě cí*),
relieving poverty (*zhèn fá*),
dwelling in mountains (*qī shān*),
adapting to nature (*shì xìng*),
remaining unmoved (*bù dòng*),
and receiving and upholding [the Dao].

Now, those who practice thus
may conquer illness and nourish their nature.
But they use saliva as medicine—
how can they construct the transformations?
They use *qi* as elixir—
how can they halt and stabilize the liver as dragon, the lungs as tiger?
How can they combine the trigrams of *kàn* as lead and *lí* as mercury?
How can they extract and augment, then irrigate the Four Seasons,
to seek the growth of the golden sprout?
These are those who do not know
the roots and foundations of the Five Phases,
the transformations of the Three Powers (*sān cái*),
far removed from the Great Dao/Way.

Master Lü asked:
*"What is the Great Dao/Way?"*

The Master Zhōnglí said:
*"The true source has been divided,
the Great Primordial (*dà pǔ*) has been scattered.
The Dao/Way arises from One,
One arises from Two,
Two arises from Three.
The One is the **substance** (*tǐ*),
the Two is the **function** (*yòng*),
the Three is the **transformations** (*zào huà*).
Which is substance and which is function?
Yin and Yang are.
Which is the transformation?
Their interplay is.

The Dao/Way generates the Two *Qi*,
the Two *Qi* generate the Three Powers (*sān cái*),
the Three Powers generate the Five Phases,
and the Five Phases generate all things.
Humans are the most refined of all things,
able to fully manifest their nature and align with Heaven and Earth."*

Master Lü asked:
*"Which Dao/Way is this?"*

The Master Zhōnglí said:
*"The Great Dao/Way, once divided, takes form,
and form brings forth measures.
Heaven, receiving the **Creative Dao** (*guàn dào*),
takes One as its substance, its function being Yang;
Earth, receiving the **Receptive Dao** (*kūn dào*),
takes Two as its substance, its function being Yin.
Yang governs ascent, Yin governs descent—
yet they mutually interact—why so?
Heaven is the accumulation of *qi*,
Earth is the accumulation of water.
Heaven, with the **Creative Dao**, draws from the **Receptive Dao**—
once drawn, it forms the eldest son, **Zhen** (☳);
twice drawn, it forms the middle son, **Kàn** (☵);
thrice drawn, it forms the youngest son, **Gèn** (☶).
This is how Heaven interacts with Earth to produce the Three Yangs.
Earth, with the **Receptive Dao**, draws from the **Creative Dao**—
once drawn, it forms the eldest daughter, **Sūn** (☴);
twice drawn, it forms the middle daughter, **Lí** (☲);
thrice drawn, it forms the youngest daughter, **Duì** (☱).
This is how Earth interacts with Heaven to produce the Three Yins.

Thus, the Three Yangs interact with the Three Yins,
and all things are born;
the Three Yins interact with the Three Yangs,
and all things are perfected.
Therefore, the **Creative Dao** and **Receptive Dao** draw from each other,
generating the Six *Qi*,
the Six *Qi* combine to form the Five Phases,
and the Five Phases combine to generate and perfect all things.

When the **Creative Dao** descends below,
the three draws have concluded,
its Yang ascends anew,
Yang within concealing Yin,
returning above to Heaven;
when the **Receptive Dao** ascends above,
the three draws have concluded,
its Yin descends anew,
Yin within concealing Yang,
returning below to Earth.
The Yang concealed within Yin—
its Yin does not dissipate,
this is called **True Yin**.
When it reaches Heaven,
it is born from Yang,
thus Yin descends from Heaven itself.
Hence, it is said: *Can there be no Yang within Yin?*
The Yang concealed within Yin—
its Yang does not perish,
this is called **True Yang**.
When it reaches Earth,
it is emitted from Yin,
thus Yang ascends from Earth itself.
Hence, it is said: *Can there be no Yin within Yang?*

Yin and Yang revolve endlessly—
those who persist ancient and enduring,
their interplay never straying from the Dao/Way."

Master Lü asked:
*"When True *Qi* is invested in True Water,
the heart’s fire and the kidney’s water interact within humans—
how does this manifest?"*

The Master Zhōnglí said:
*"When father and mother unite,
Yang advances first,
Yin is born afterward,
and the embryo forms—
just as the three draws of the **Creative Dao** and **Receptive Dao**.
Thus, my True *Qi*—Yang—
is concealed within water and governs ascent;
True Water—Yin—
is concealed within *Qi* and governs descent.
Yang follows water in descending,
this is the **Creative Dao** drawing from the **Receptive Dao**,
from above to below.
Above is **Zhen** (☳), becoming the liver;
middle is **Kàn** (☵), becoming the kidneys;
below is **Gèn** (☶), becoming the bladder.
Yin follows *Qi* in ascending,
this is the **Receptive Dao** drawing from the **Creative Dao**,
from below to above.
Below is **Sūn** (☴), becoming the gallbladder;
middle is **Lí** (☲), becoming the heart;
above is **Duì** (☱), becoming the lungs.
One pillar of Yang remains in the kidneys,
and True *Qi* is born.
True *Qi* ascends to the heart and lungs,
and True Essence (*zhēn yè*) is born.
Ascending and descending without depletion,
one can cultivate longevity.
If one adheres to the seasons without restraint,
and extracts and augments with measure,
one can achieve long life.
If one practices without weariness,
their *Qi* will flourish,
their spirit (*hún*) will have no Yin,
their Yang will be robust,
their soul (*pò*) will possess *Qi*,
ascending and descending like Heaven and Earth,
waxing and waning like the sun and moon—
one can enter sainthood."*

Master Lü asked:
*"Can one hear of the sun and moon’s revolutions and their interplay within humans?"*

「Master Zhōnglí said to Lüzi: The sprouting of **Xuan** (☵) and **Huáng** (☲) is like Heaven and Earth;
its form is like an egg.
Six directions converge at the center,
like a sphere of **Jū** (☱).
The sun and moon revolve above Heaven and below Earth,
like a shuttle in motion.
The sun and moon are the essence of Yin and Yang,
silently marking the degrees of Heaven and Earth’s union.

Now, the sun—
it emerges from the east at dawn,
retires to the west at dusk,
thus dividing day and night.
In winter, it reaches the southernmost point,
in summer, the northernmost point,
and thus the cold and heat are determined.

The moon—
it carries the **pò** (魄) in the west,
receives the **hún** (魂) from the east,
shines its light in the evening,
and hides its **hún** at dawn.
At its beginning,
the **pò** gives birth to the **hún**, appearing like a bow;
in the early evening, its light blazes in the west.
Next,
the **hún** grows half-full—this is called the **upper xián** (弦).
In the early evening, its light blazes in the south.
Next,
the **hún** is full.
Facing the sun, in the early evening, its light blazes in the east;
then,
the **hún** generates the **pò**, appearing like a broken mirror.
At the start of the next day,
the **hún** hides in the west;
next,
the **pò** grows half-full—this is called the **lower xián** (弦).
At the start of the next day,
the **hún** hides in the south;
next,
the **pò** is full.
With the sun in opposition,
at the start of the next day,
the **hún** hides in the east—
thus, the **hún** generates the **pò**,
and the **pò** generates the **hún**,
advancing and retreating in due season,
conforming to the **Qián** (☰) and **Kūn** (☷) cycles and numbers.

When the sun reaches its southernmost point,
it rises at the very beginning of **Chén** (辰),
and sets at the very end of **Shēn** (申),
each lasting fifty parts.
Beyond this,
its rising and setting shift from south to north.
When it reaches its northernmost point,
it rises at the very end of **Yín** (寅),
and sets at the very beginning of **Xū** (戌),
each lasting fifty parts.
Beyond this,
its rising and setting shift from north to south,
and then again to the southernmost point.
The days of summer are like the evenings of winter;
the evenings of winter are like the days of summer.
At the southernmost month,
its rising shifts from north to south,
comparable to the days of summer;
at the northernmost month,
its rising shifts from south to north,
comparable to the evenings of winter.
This is the pattern of their coming and going,
which establishes the sequence of cold and heat.

Lüzi said: *"What lies in Heaven is known to the rocks;
what lies in humans is not yet understood."*

Master Zhōnglí said: *"The mechanism of Heaven and Earth lies in the rising and falling of Yin and Yang.
If I compare myself to the sun and moon,
then the moon receives the **hún** of the sun,
transforming Yang into Yin,
until Yin is exhausted and Yang is pure—
like the sun’s radiance.
My **qi** can refine and become spirit,
returning to **pure Yang** (纯阳).

Lüzi said: *"What comes first—the principles of Yin and Yang’s rising and falling,
or the degrees of the sun and moon’s essence merging?
Master Zhōnglí said: *"To understand the rising and falling of Yin and Yang,
and to merge **True Water** (真水) and **True Fire** (真火),
thus stabilizing the **Dan Field** (丹田) and **Great Elixir** (大药),
one can harmonize with Heaven and Earth.
If one seeks to ascend lightly,
then they should follow the sun and moon’s conjunctions,
refining Yin with Yang,
so that Yin does not arise;
nourishing spirit with **qi**,
so that spirit does not scatter.
Then, the **Five Qi** (五气) return to their origin,
and the **Three Flowers** (三花) gather at the crown.
This is indeed timely.

The rising and falling of Yin and Yang,
the yearly conjunction of seasons;
the sun and moon’s revolutions,
the monthly conjunction of phases;
human **qi** and fluids,
the daily conjunction of day and night—
thus, time is divided into four grades.

A hundred years is the common human lifespan.
From one to thirty is the **youthful vigor** (少壮) period;
sixty is the **prime of life** (长大) period;
ninety is the **aged infirmity** (老耄) period;
from a hundred to a hundred and twenty is the **decline** (衰落) period—
this is called the **time within the body** (身中之时).

Twelve **Chén** (辰) make one day;
five days make one **hòu** (候);
three **hòu** make one **qi** (气);
three **qi** make one **jié** (节);
two **jié** make one **season** (时).
When the season belongs to spring,
Yin is half within Yang,
and its **qi** shifts from cold to warmth.
When the season belongs to summer,
Yang is half within Yang,
and its **qi** shifts from warmth to heat.
When the season belongs to autumn,
Yang is half within Yin,
and its **qi** shifts from heat to chill.
When the season belongs to winter,
Yin is half within Yin,
and its **qi** shifts from chill to cold—
this is called the **time within the year** (年中之时).

The moon has three **xún** (旬),
with three hundred and sixty **Chén**,
three thousand **kè** (刻),
and eighteen thousand **fēn** (分).
From the **new moon** (朔旦) to the **upper xián** (上弦),
Yin is half within Yang;
from the **upper xián** (上弦) to the **full moon** (既望),
Yang is half within Yang;
from the **full moon** (既望) to the **lower xián** (下弦),
Yang is half within Yin;
from the **lower xián** (下弦) to the **end of the month** (晦),
Yin is half within Yin—
this is called the **time within the moon** (月中之时).

Sixty parts make one **kè** (刻);
eight **kè** and twenty parts make one **shí** (时).
Half of this time is one **guà** (卦),
speaking of its **guà** to determine the eight directions,
and discussing its **zhèng** (正) to divide the four cardinal points.
From **Zǐ** (子) to **Mǎo** (卯),
Yin is half within Yang,
with **Great Yin** (太阴) giving rise to **Lesser Yang** (少阳);
from **Mǎo** (卯) to **Wǔ** (午),
Yang is half within pure Yang,
with **Lesser Yang** (少阳) giving rise to **Great Yang** (太阳);
from **Wǔ** (午) to **Yǒu** (酉),
Yang is half within Yin,
with **Great Yang** (太阳) giving rise to **Lesser Yin** (少阴);
from **Yǒu** (酉) to **Zǐ** (子),
Yin is half within pure Yin,
with **Lesser Yin** (少阴) giving rise to **Great Yin** (太阴)—
this is called the **time within the day** (日中之时).

Ah! What is hard to obtain yet easy to lose—
it is the **time within the body** (身中之时).
The **time within the year** (年中之月) arrives slowly and departs swiftly;
the **time within the day** (一日中之辰) is swift as lightning and stony fire.»

「Now, consider the vigor of my years—
when my vitality is strong, the **root essence** (根元) is firmly established and readily cultivated; with a thousand days, great achievement may be realized.
In the middle years, first **nourish the completeness** (先圆补之) before reaching their peak;
when old age arrives, **rescue and support** (救护之、辅益之) must be applied, accumulating minor success toward moderate achievement, and moderate success toward **restoring youthfulness** (还童) before ceasing.

The distance between Heaven and Earth is **eighty-four thousand li** (八万四千里).
When the sun reaches its southernmost point, the **central Yang** (地中之阳) ascends.
Every **breath of *qi*** (一气), spanning **fifteen days** (旬有五日), rises **seven thousand li** (七千里).
After **eighteen tens** (十有八), its ascent reaches Heaven, where the **Great Polarity** (太极) gives rise to **Yin** (阴).

When the sun reaches its northernmost point, the **central Yin** (天中之阴) descends.
Every **breath of *qi*** (一气), spanning **fifteen days** (旬有五日), descends **seven thousand li** (七千里).
After **eighteen tens** (十有八), its descent reaches Earth, where the **Great Polarity** (太极) gives rise to **Yang** (阳).
Thus, it follows a **cyclical pattern** (循环).

The **perimeter of the sun and moon** (日月之围) is each **eight hundred and forty li** (八百有四十里).
After dawn, **nine *qi* arises from six** (六之中起九焉).
For a single **moon’s cycle** (一之日), the **time** (时) spans **twelve tens** (十有二), and the **soul within the body** (魄中之魂) ascends **seven thousand li** (七千里).
After **fifteen days** (旬有五日), the **time** reaches **one hundred and eighty** (一百有八十), and the **soul within the body** (魄中之魂) ascends **eight hundred and forty li** (八百有四十里).
After the full moon, **six *qi* arises from nine** (九之中起六焉).
In the middle of the moon’s cycle, the **time** spans **twelve tens** (十有二), and the **body within the soul** (魂中之魄) descends **seventy li** (七十里).
After **fifteen days** (旬有五日), the **time** reaches **one hundred and eighty** (一百有八十), and the **body within the soul** (魂中之魄) descends **eight hundred and forty li** (八百有四十里).
This too follows a **cyclical pattern** (循环).

The **heart** (心) and **kidneys** (肾) of a person are **eighty-four inches apart** (相去八寸有四分), with the **ascending and descending of Yin and Yang** (阴阳升降) mirroring that of Heaven and Earth.
The **interaction of *qi* and bodily fluids** (气液相生) follows the same principle: **fluid generates *qi*** (气中生液) and **fluid contains *qi*** (液中生气), just as the sun and moon do.

Yet Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon,
have **years following years** (年之后有年) and **moons following moons** (月之后有月).
Humans, however, do not grasp the **timing of conjunction and separation** (交合之时),
do not know when to **preserve** (损) or **nourish** (补),
do not know when to **augment** (益) or **withdraw** (收).
When **Yin and Yang interact** (阴交、阳交),
they fail to **nurture Yang** (养阳) or **refine Yin** (炼阴).
Moons pass without **preservation or augmentation** (损益),
days pass without **proper cultivation** (行持),
yet my years and months are **limited** (有限).

**Master Lü** (吕子) asked earnestly:
*"I wish to hear the methods of **refinement and cultivation** (修炼之法),
and the **timing of practice** (行持之时)."*

**Master Zhōng Lí** (子钟离子) replied:
*"The *qi* of the **five viscera** (五藏) has **monthly waxing and waning** (月有盛衰),
and **daily ebb and flow** (日有进退).
There are **critical moments of conjunction** (交合之时).
When the **five phases** (五度) are fully expressed,
and the **six seasonal shifts** (六候) have passed,
**essence is refined** (精炼) and **true *qi* arises** (真气生).
When **true *qi* is refined** (气炼),
the **Yang Spirit** (阳神) coalesces.
When the **Spirit** (神) is refined,
the **Great Dao** (大道) is attained.

**Master Lü** (吕子) said:
*"The five viscera correspond to the **five phases** (五行): Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.
Their positions align with the **four directions and center** (东西南北中).
Is there a **method of their generation and completion** (生成之道)?
Are there **timings of their conjunction** (交合有时)?
Are there **principles of their gathering** (采取有法)?"*

**Master Zhōng Lí** (子钟离子) replied:
*"Heaven and Earth divide, and the **Five Celestial Sovereigns** (五帝) are arranged:
**Qīngdì** (青帝, the Azure Sovereign) governs the **East** (束), embodying **Spring** (春令),
giving rise to **Yang** (阳) within **Yin** (阴),
and thus all things **germinate** (生).
**Chìdì** (赤帝, the Red Sovereign) governs the **South** (南), embodying **Summer** (夏令),
ascending **Yang** (阳) within **Yang** (阳),
and thus all things **flourish** (长).
**Báidì** (白帝, the White Sovereign) governs the **West** (西), embodying **Autumn** (秋令),
giving rise to **Yin** (阴) within **Yang** (阳),
and thus all things **mature** (成).
**Hēidì** (黑帝, the Black Sovereign) governs the **North** (北), embodying **Winter** (冬令),
advancing **Yin** (阴) within **Yin** (阴),
and thus all things **dormant** (陨).

Each **season** (四时) spans **eighteen tens of days** (各旬有八日).
The **central Yellow Sovereign** (中央黄帝) oversees:
**Spring** (春) to **assist their germination** (发生),
**Summer** (夏) to **support their growth** (长育),
**Autumn** (秋) to **aid their establishment** (结立),
**Winter** (冬) to **regulate their severity** (严凛).
The **Five Celestial Sovereigns** (五帝) govern in turn,
each for **seventy-two tens of days** (各七旬有二日),
thus completing the **three hundred and sixty days** (三百有六十日) of a year.

The **children of Qīngdì** (青帝之子) are **Jiǎ** (甲) and **Yǐ** (乙),
their **position** (位) in the **East** (束),
their **virtue/power** (德) in **Wood** (木).
The **children of Chìdì** (赤帝之子) are **Bǐng** (丙) and **Dīng** (丁),
their **position** (位) in the **South** (南),
their **virtue/power** (德) in **Fire** (火).
The **children of Huángdì** (黄帝之子) are **Wù** (戊) and **Jǐ** (己),
their **position** (位) in the **center** (中央),
their **virtue/power** (德) in **Earth** (土).
The **children of Báidì** (白帝之子) are **Gēng** (庚) and **Xīn** (辛),
their **position** (位) in the **West** (西),
their **virtue/power** (德) in **Metal** (金).
The **children of Hēidì** (黑帝之子) are **Rén** (壬) and **Guǐ** (癸),
their **position** (位) in the **North** (北),
their **virtue/power** (德) in **Water** (水).

At their **conjunction** (交),
they manifest in **time** (时) as **symbols** (为象):
**Wood** (木) is the **Azure Dragon** (青龙);
**Fire** (火) is the **Vermilion Bird** (朱雀);
**Earth** (土) is **Gōuchēn** (勾陈);
**Metal** (金) is the **White Tiger** (白虎);
**Water** (水) is the **Dark Tortoise** (玄武).
When they **conjunction in time** (见於时) and **generate things** (而生物):
**Yǐ** (乙) of **Wood** (木) meets **Gēng** (庚) of **Metal** (金),
and in **Spring** (春), there is **elm** (榆), whose hue is **green and white** (青而白),
never straying from the **virtue/power of Metal and Wood** (金木).
**Xīn** (辛) of **Metal** (金) meets **Bǐng** (丙) of **Fire** (火),
and in **Autumn** (秋), there is **date** (枣), whose hue is **white and red** (白而赤),
never straying from the **virtue/power of Metal and Fire** (金火).
**Jǐ** (己) of **Earth** (土) meets **Jiǎ** (甲) of **Wood** (木),
and at the **end of Summer** (夏之杪) and **beginning of Autumn** (秋之端), there is **melon** (瓜), whose hue is **green and yellow** (青而黄),
never straying from the **virtue/power of Earth and Wood** (土木).
**Dīng** (丁) of **Fire** (火) meets **Rén** (壬) of **Water** (水),
and in **Summer** (夏), there is **mulberry** (档), whose hue is **red and black** (赤而黑),
never straying from the **virtue/power of Water and Fire** (水火).
**Guǐ** (癸) of **Water** (水) meets **Wù** (戊) of **Earth** (土),
and in **Winter** (冬), there is **tangerine** (橘), whose hue is **black and yellow** (黑而黄),
never straying from the **virtue/power of Water and Earth** (水土).
By **this analogy** (以类推之), it can be **exhaustively understood** (可胜既欤).

**Master Lü** (吕子) said:
*"The principles of **time** (时) are known,
but those of **human cultivation** (人) are not."*

**Master Zhōng Lí** (子钟离子) replied:
*"Humans have a **circular head and square feet** (圆颅方趾),
embodying the **symbols of Heaven and Earth** (天地之象).
The **mechanism of Yin ascending and Yang descending** (阴升阳降) is concealed within them.
The **kidneys** (肾) are **Water** (水);
the **heart** (心) is **Fire** (火);
the **liver** (肝) is **Wood** (木);
the **lungs** (肺) are **Metal** (金);
the **spleen** (脾) is **Earth** (土).
There is a **method of their generation and completion** (生成之道).
The **generating** (生) is called **mother** (母),
the **receiving** (受生) is called **child** (子).
Thus, there is also the **principle of mutual subjugation** (刚克之道).
**Generating** (生) refers to the **five phases nurturing each other** (五行相生),
and **subjugating** (克) refers to the **five phases restraining each other** (五行相克).
The **subjugating** (克) is called **husband** (夫),
the **receiving subjugation** (受克) is called **wife** (妇).

Now, how does the **generating *qi*** (气之生) originate?
The **kidneys** (肾) generate the **liver** (肝),
the **liver** (肝) generates the **heart** (心),
the **heart** (心) generates the **spleen** (脾),
the **spleen** (脾) generates the **lungs** (肺),
and the **lungs** (肺) generate the **kidneys** (肾).

How does the **subjugating *qi*** (气之克) originate?
The **kidneys** (肾) subjugate the **heart** (心),
the **heart** (心) subjugates the **lungs** (肺),
the **lungs** (肺) subjugate the **liver** (肝),
the **liver** (肝) subjugates the **spleen** (脾),
and the **spleen** (脾) subjugates the **kidneys** (肾).」

Thus it is said:

The **kidneys** (肾) are the **husband** (夫) of the **heart** (心), the **mother** (母) of the **liver** (肝), the **wife** (妇) of the **spleen** (脾), and the **child** (子) of the **lungs** (肺);
The **liver** (肝) is the **husband** (夫) of the **spleen** (脾), the **mother** (母) of the **heart** (心), the **wife** (妇) of the **lungs** (肺), and the **child** (子) of the **kidneys** (肾);
The **heart** (心) is the **husband** (夫) of the **lungs** (肺), the **mother** (母) of the **spleen** (脾), the **wife** (妇) of the **kidneys** (肾), and the **child** (子) of the **liver** (肝);
The **lungs** (肺) are the **husband** (夫) of the **liver** (肝), the **mother** (母) of the **kidneys** (肾), the **wife** (妇) of the **heart** (心), and the **child** (子) of the **spleen** (脾);
The **spleen** (脾) is the **husband** (夫) of the **kidneys** (肾), the **mother** (母) of the **lungs** (肺), the **wife** (妇) of the **liver** (肝), and the **child** (子) of the **heart** (心).

The **heart** (心) manifests internally as **pulse** (脉), externally as **complexion** (色).
The **mouth and tongue** (口舌) are its portals! Subdued by the **kidneys** (肾), yet serving the **lungs** (肺)—thus husband and wife.
When it receives **spleen** (脾) *qi*, it flourishes; when it encounters the **liver** (肝), it wanes—thus child and mother.

The **kidneys** (肾) manifest internally as **bones** (骨), externally as **hair** (发).
The **ears** (耳) are its portals! Subdued by the **spleen** (脾), yet serving the **heart** (心)—thus husband and wife.
When it receives **lungs** (肺) *qi*, it flourishes; when it encounters the **liver** (肝), it wanes—thus child and mother.

The **liver** (肝) manifests internally as **sinews/tendons** (筋), externally as **claws** (爪).
The **eyes** (目) are its portals! Subdued by the **lungs** (肺), yet serving the **spleen** (脾)—thus husband and wife.
When it receives **kidneys** (肾) *qi*, it flourishes; when it encounters the **heart** (心), it wanes—thus child and mother.

The **lungs** (肺) manifest internally as **skin** (肤), externally as **fur/hair** (毛).
The **nose** (鼻) is its portal! Subdued by the **heart** (心), yet serving the **liver** (肝)—thus husband and wife.
When it receives **spleen** (脾) *qi*, it flourishes; when it encounters the **kidneys** (肾), it wanes—thus child and mother.

The **spleen** (脾) manifests internally as **viscera** (藏), externally as **flesh** (肉).
The **lips and teeth** (唇齿) are its portals! Breathing regulates the flow and return, subdued by the **liver** (肝), yet serving the **kidneys** (肾)—thus husband and wife.
When it receives **heart** (心) *qi*, it flourishes; when it encounters the **lungs** (肺), it wanes—thus child and mother.

Master Lü said: The **heart** (心), being **fire** (火), how does it obtain downward movement?
The **kidneys** (肾), being **water** (水), how does it obtain upward ascent?
The **spleen** (脾), being **earth** (土), earth lies in the center and receives **fire** (心) to flourish—how could it not subjugate **water** (肾)?
The **lungs** (肺), being **metal** (金), metal lies above yet connects downward with **fire** (心) to be consumed—how could it generate **water** (肾)?

The **generating** (生) is distant, the **subjugating** (克) is near—how does this work?
Master Zǐ Zhōnglí (锺离子) replied:

The **five phases** (五行) return to their **source** (源) by drawing upon **original *yang* *qi*** (元阳) to ascend and elevate, thus producing **true water** (真水).
**True water** (真水) transforms and then generates **true *qi*** (真气), **true *qi*** (真气) transforms and then generates **yang spirit** (阳神).
This begins with the **five phases** (五行) establishing their positions, each having a **husband** (夫) and a **wife** (妇).

The **kidneys** (肾), being **water** (水), contain **metal** (金)—my **medicinal actions** (起功) must recognize this.
**Metal** (金) originally generates **water** (水), hence it is called **"metal within water"** (水中金).
**Water** (水) harms **earth** (土). My **herbal prescriptions** (采药) must return **earth** to **water**.

The **dragon** (龙) is the **liver**’s (肝) **symbol** (象);
The **tiger** (虎) is the **lungs**’ (肺) **spirit** (神).
The **yang dragon** (阳龙) emerges from **Lǐ** (离), the **yin tiger** (阴虎) arises from **Kǎn** (坎).
When the **five phases** (五行) reverse their positions, **yin** and **yang** *qi* transmit between **husband** (夫) and **wife** (妇).

From **child** (子) to **wǔ** (午), **yang** generates **yang**, and the **five phases** reverse—thus **fluids** (液) flow between **husband** (夫) and **wife** (妇).
From **wǔ** (午) to **child** (子), **yin** refines **yang**, yet **yang** cannot fully merge with **yin**—it does not reach its extreme.
Without **yin**, there would be no death;
**Yin** cannot fully merge with **yang**, nor does **yang** generate its extreme—without **yin**, life would be cut short.

Master Lü said: The **five phases** (五行), how do they originate from **yin-yang *qi*** (阴阳之气)?
Master Zǐ Zhōnglí (锺离子) replied:

At the **beginning of life** (人之始), **form** (造形) is established, and thus the **kidneys** (肾) generate the **spleen** (脾),
the **spleen** (脾) generates the **liver** (肝),
the **liver** (肝) generates the **lungs** (肺),
the **lungs** (肺) generate the **heart** (心),
the **heart** (心) generates the **small intestine** (小肠),
the **small intestine** (小肠) generates the **large intestine** (大肠),
the **large intestine** (大肠) generates the **gallbladder** (胆),
the **gallbladder** (胆) generates the **stomach** (胃),
and the **stomach** (胃) generates the **bladder** (膀胱).
This is the **yin essence and blood** (阴之精血).

When **original *yang* *qi*** (元阳) first sprouts, it lies within the **two kidneys** (二肾).
The **kidneys** (肾), being **water** (水), contain **fire** (火) that ascends, thus becoming **vital *qi*** (气), which pays homage to the **heart** (心).
The **heart** (心), being **yang** (阳), unites **yang** with **yang**, thus the **Great Ultimate** (太极) generates **yin** (阴).

From this, accumulated **vital *qi*** (气) produces **fluids** (液),
and **fluids** (液) descend from the **heart** (心) to return to the **kidneys** (肾).
The **liver** (肝) is the **mother** (母) of the **heart** (心), the **child** (子) of the **kidneys** (肾),
transmitting and guiding **kidney** *qi* (气) to the **heart** (心).
The **lungs** (肺) are the **wife** (妇) of the **heart** (心), the **mother** (母) of the **kidneys** (肾),
transmitting the **heart**’s (心) **fluids** (液) to the **kidneys** (肾).
The **vital *qi*** (气) and **fluids** (液) rise and fall like the **yin-yang** of **heaven and earth** (天地阴阳).
The **liver** (肝) and **lungs** (肺) transmit and guide like the **sun and moon**’s (日月) **reciprocating movements** (往复).

The **five phases** (五行) are merely **names** (名) for **numbers** (数).
Discussing their **interactions and generation** (交合生成),
only **original *yang* *qi*** (元阳) stands as their **foundation** (本).
**Vital *qi*** (气) generates **fluids** (液), **fluids** (液) generate **vital *qi*** (气),
thus one knows the **kidneys** (肾) are the **root** (根) of **vital *qi*** (气),
and the **heart** (心) is the **source** (源) of **fluids** (液).
When the **spiritual root** (灵根) is firmly established,
within the **dim and hazy** (恍惚), its **vital *qi*** (气) generates **true water** (真水);
When the **heart’s source** (心源) is clear,
within the **obscure and distant** (杳冥), its **fluids** (液) generate **true fire** (真火).
Within **fire**, one recognizes the **dragon** (龙);
Within **water**, one recognizes the **tiger** (虎).
When these two interact, the **yellow shoots flourish** (黄芽茂矣).

**[Volume 40 of *Dao Gun* (道枢)]** *To the Wandering Master Zēng Huì* (游子曾慥集)

「Transmission of the Dao in Its Middle Section: Lüzi Says: What is meant by **yellow shoots** (黄芽)?

Zhōnglízi Says: The **dragon** (龙) and **tiger** (虎) are what is meant.

The **dragon** (龙) is not the **liver** (肝), but the **true water** (真水) of the **separation phase** (离官);
The **tiger** (虎) is not the **lungs** (肺), but the **true fire** (真火) of the **abyss phase** (坎位).

Lüzi Says: What is meant by **fire** (火) and **water** (水)?

Zhōnglízi Says: Within my body, there are **eighteen measures of water** (水十有八): the **Four Seas** (四海), the **Five Lakes** (五湖), the **Nine Rivers** (九江), the **Three Isles** (三岛), the **Flowery Pool** (华池), the **Jade Pool** (瑶池), the **Phoenix Pool** (凤池), the **Celestial Pool** (天池), the **Jade Spring** (玉泉), the **Kun Pool** (昆池), the **Primordial Pond** (元潭), the **Mythic Enclosure** (闽苑), the **Divine Water** (神水), the **Golden Waves** (金波), the **Luminous Fluids** (琼液), the **Yang Sū** (阳酥), and the **White Snow** (白雪).

Within my body, there are **three kinds of fire** (火有三): the **Sovereign Fire** (君火), the **Ministerial Fire** (臣火), and the **Common Fire** (民火).
These three are rooted in **primordial yang** (元阳).
Thus, **true *qi*** (真气) is generated.
**True *qi*** (真气), when gathered, brings **tranquility** (安); when weak, brings **illness** (疾); when scattered, brings **death** (死).

Lüzi Says: Though **primordial yang** (元阳) is so limited, how does it give rise to the **three fires** (三火), which emerge from the realm of **abundant water and dense yin** (群水众阴)? Their dispersion is easy, yet their intensity is hard to achieve—how so?

Zhōnglízi Says: The **heart** (心) is the **sea of blood** (血之海);
The **kidneys** (肾) are the **sea of *qi*** (气之海);
The **marrow palaces** (泥丸) are the **sea of marrow** (髓之海);
The **stomach** (胃) is the **sea of water and grain** (水谷之海).
These are my **Four Seas** (四海).
The **five viscera** (五藏) each possess their own **fluids** (液), and their positions correspond to the **Five Directions** (五方): east, west, south, north, and center.
These are my **Five Lakes** (五湖).
The **small intestine** (小肠), **four zhang and two chi** (二丈有四尺) in length, winding **nine bends** (九曲).
This is my **Nine Rivers** (九江).
The **large intestine** (大肠), when descending, is my **Primordial Pond** (元潭).
The **upper island** (上岛) is the **forehead** (顶), the **middle island** (中岛) is the **heart** (心), and the **lower island** (下岛) is the **kidneys** (肾).
These **Three Isles** (三岛) are my **Mythic Enclosure** (闱苑).
Beneath the **Yellow Court** (黄庭) lies the **Flowery Pool** (华池), before the **Red Gate** (丹阙) lies the **Jade Pool** (瑶池), where the **Jade Capital** (玉京) is approached lies the **Kun Pool** (昆池), and within the **Inner Palace** (内院) lies the **Celestial Pool** (天池).
Between the **heart** (心) and **lungs** (肺) lies the **Phoenix Pool** (凤池), and within the **lips and teeth** (唇齿) lies the **Jade Spring** (玉泉).
The **Divine Spring** (神泉) arises from **vital *qi*** (气), the **Golden Waves** (金波) descend from the heavens, where the **Red Dragon** (赤龙) rests—thus, **Luminous Fluids** (琼液) and **Jade Spring** (玉泉) are formed.
Once the **embryonic transformations** (凡胎) are complete, **White Snow** (白雪) and **Yang Sū** (阳酥) emerge.
I have often irrigated and nourished them to quench their **flame** (炎), for indeed, there is a **measure** (度) to this.

The **Supreme** (太上) is called **Jade Fluid** (玉液), the next is called **Golden Fluid** (金液)—both can be used to **return the elixir** (还丹).
When **extracted** (抽) and **augmented** (增), they correspond to **ritual bathing** (沐浴)—indeed, this too has its **measure** (度).
The **Supreme** (太上) is the **Central Field** (日中田), the next is the **Lower Field** (日下田)—both can be used to **refine the form** (炼形).
**Jade Elixir** (玉药) and **Golden Petals** (金葩), when transformed, yield **white and yellow brews** (白黄酝酬), sweet as **dew** (甘露), and their **refinement emits a fragrant intensity** (芬烈).
This is the **effect of water** (水之效).

When the **Common Fire** (民火) ascends, it aids the **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气) in generating **true water** (真水);
When the **Ministerial Fire** (臣火) ascends, it mingles with the **heart’s fluids** (心之液) to generate **true *qi*** (真气).
In **small applications** (小用), demons can be **subdued** (降), and illnesses can be **cured** (已);
In **great applications** (大用), the **embodied essence** (质) can be **refined** (炼), and the **elixir** (丹) can be **perfected** (成).
To **burn through the Microcosmic Orbit** (周天) and **consummate the body** (焚其身),
To **bind the Solar Pass** (勒阳关) and **return to the source** (还其元),
To **partition the Nine Regions’ influence** (别九州之势) and **nourish the yang spirit** (养阳神),
To **scorch the Three Pèng burdens** (燎三彭之累) and **expel yin ghosts** (除阴鬼),
To **ascend and traverse the Three Passes** (上行以通三关),
To **descend and dissolve the Seven Souls** (下运以消七魄):
When **refining the form into *qi*** (炼形成气) is achieved, one becomes a **guest of Heaven** (宾天);
When **refining *qi* into spirit** (炼气成神) is achieved, one **sheds the mortal coil** (蜕).
This is the **effect of fire** (火之效).

Lüzi Says: How does the principle of **"the few overcoming the many, the weak overcoming the strong"** (少胜多、弱致强) apply here?

Zhōnglízi Says: When the **eighteen measures of yin** (二八之阴) are **consumed** (消),
And the **nine measures of yang** (九三之阳) are **restored** (还),
Then **golden elixir** (金丹) is **perfected** (成).
When **sevenfold return** (七返) and **ninefold restoration** (九还) are achieved,
Then the **embryonic transformations** (胎) and **immortal birth** (仙) are **realized** (化).

**True *qi*** (真气) resides in the **heart** (心), for the **heart** (心) is the **source of fluids** (液之源);
**Primordial yang** (元阳) resides in the **kidneys** (肾), for the **kidneys** (肾) are the **abyss of *qi*** (气之渊).
The **bladder** (膀胱) is the **Common Fire** (民火), the **repository of fluids** (津液之府).
If the **kidneys** (肾) do not **restrain the Common Fire** (止於民火),
They cannot **fulfill their function** (为用).
Why so?
The **heart** (心) and **kidneys** (肾) are **eight cun and four fen apart** (相去八寸有四分)—this is the **position of Heaven and Earth** (天地之位).
**Vital *qi*** (气) and **fluids** (液) are the **Great Ultimate’s** (太极) **mutually generating** (相生) forces—the **interaction of yin and yang** (阴阳之交).
The **twelve divisions of a day** (一日十有二时) are the **number of a year** (一岁之数).
The **heart’s fluids** (心之液) are not **self-generated** (自生也),
But descend from the **lungs’ fluids** (肺之液) into the **heart** (心), and thus **flow** (其液行).
From above to below, they return to the **Lower Field** (下田), and are called **"Wife’s Return to the Husband’s Domain"** (妇还夫官).

The **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气) is not **self-generated** (自生也),
But ascends from the **bladder’s *qi*** (膀胱之气),
And thus the **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气) **flows** (行),
From below to above, to **pay homage to the Central Sovereign** (朝中元), and is called **"Husband’s Return to the Wife’s Chamber"** (夫还妇室).

The **liver’s *qi*** (肝之气) **guides and conducts** (导行) the **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气),
From below to above, until it reaches the **heart** (心)—this is **fire** (火).
When the two **kinds of *qi*** (二气) **interact** (相交),
They **permeate the lungs** (熏蒸於肺),
And the **lungs’ fluids** (肺之液) descend,
From the **heart** (心) and onward—
Thus, it is said that **"the heart generates fluids"** (心生液),
And **"the husband is born from the heart"** (夫生於心) yet does not **scatter** (散),
This is called **true water** (真水).

The **lungs’ fluids** (肺之液) **transmit and deliver** (传送) the **heart’s fluids** (心之液),
From above to below, until they reach the **kidneys** (肾)—this is **water** (水).
When the two **waters** (二水) **interact** (相交),
They **moisten the bladder** (浸润於膀胱),
And its **vital *qi*** (气) ascends,
From the **kidneys** (肾) and onward—
Thus, it is said that **"the kidneys generate *qi*** (肾生气),
And **"the *qi* is born from the kidneys"** (气生於肾) yet does not **consumed** (消),
This is called **true fire** (真火).

**True fire** (真火) emerges from **water** (水),
**Dim and hazy** (恍恍惚惚), yet within it there is **substance** (物),
Visible yet **cannot be seen** (视之不可见),
Seizable yet **cannot be obtained** (取之不可得).
**True water** (真水) emerges from **fire** (火),
**Obscure and distant** (杳杳冥冥), yet within it there is **essence** (精),
Seen yet **cannot be retained** (见之不能留),
Retained yet **cannot be stopped** (留之不能止).

The **substance** (物) within **fire** (火) is the **dragon** (龙),
The **essence** (精) within **water** (水) is the **tiger** (虎).
Is this what is called the **Great Elixir** (大药)?

Lüzi Says: The **heart’s fire** (心之火) generates **fluids** (液),
Thus the **dragon** (龙) **hides within water** (隐於水), yet is not in the **liver** (肝),
Its emergence is from the **separation phase** (离);
The **kidneys’ water** (肾之水) generates **vital *qi*** (气),
Thus the **tiger** (虎) **conceals within fire** (藏於火), yet is not in the **lungs** (肺),
Its birth is from the **abyss phase** (坎),
How so?

Zhōnglízi Says: The **dragon** (龙) is a **yang entity** (阳物),
In **things** (物) it is **wood** (木), in **humans** (人) it is the **liver** (肝);

The **tiger** (虎) is a **yin entity** (阴物),
In **things** (物) it is **metal** (金), in **humans** (人) it is the **lungs** (肺).

The **liver** (肝), though **yang** (阳), resides in a **yin position** (阴位),
Thus the **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气) transmits the **liver’s *qi*** (肝之气),
To **nourish wood with water** (以水生木) as it does.

When the **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气) is abundant and the **liver’s *qi*** (肝之气) arises,
Its *qi* once generated, **cuts off the kidneys’ residual yin** (以绝肾之余阴),
And the **pure yang *qi*** (纯阳之气) ascends above#1.

The **lungs** (肺), though **yin** (阴), reside in a **yang position** (阳位),
Thus the **heart’s fluids** (心之液) transmit the **lungs’ fluids** (肺之液),
To **subdue metal with fire** (以火克金) as it does.

When the **heart’s fluids** (心之液) arise and the **spleen’s fluids** (脾之液) are generated,
Its fluids once formed, **cut off the heart’s residual yang** (以绝心之余阳),
And the **pure yin fluids** (纯阴之液) descend below.

Now, though the **liver** (肝) is **yang** (阳),
It can **cut off the kidneys’ residual yin** (绝肾之余阴),
Thus it is known that when *qi* **overflows in the liver** (过於肝),
It becomes **pure yang** (纯阳),
Within which the **True One’s water** (真一之水) is concealed without form,
And is named the **Yang Dragon** (阳龙).

Now, though the **lungs** (肺) are **yin** (阴),
They can **cut off the heart’s residual yang** (绝心之余阳),
Thus it is known that when fluids **reach the lungs** (至於肺),
They become **pure yin** (纯阴),
Within which they bear the **True Yang *qi*** (正阳之气) yet remain unseen,
And are named the **Yin Tiger** (阴虎).

How then do *qi* ascending and fluids descending **interact** (交)?
The **True One’s water** (真一之水), upon encountering fluids, **unites** (合);
The **True Yang *qi*** (正阳之气), upon encountering *qi*, **converges** (聚).

This is the principle of **"like with like, things in groups"** (方以类，物以群).

When the **transmission and circulation** (传行) occur,
They are **regulated by method** (以法制之),
So that the **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气) does not stray,
And within its *qi* the **True One’s water** (真一之水) is gathered;
The **heart’s fluids** (心之液) do not disperse,
And within its fluids the **True Yang *qi*** (正阳之气) is taken.

When these two meet,
They **achieve union like millet grains** (日得如黍米),
A hundred days and the **elixir’s power** (药力) is complete;
Two hundred days and the **sage embryo** (圣胎) becomes firm.
Three hundred days and the **embryonic sage** (胎仙) is perfected.

Lüzi Says: When *qi* is generated, fluids **also descend** (其液亦降).
My **True One’s water** (真一之水), can it not **follow and descend**, transmitting to the **five viscera** (五藏)?
When fluids are generated, *qi* **also ascends** (其气亦升).
My **True Yang *qi*** (正阳之气), can it not **follow and emerge**, ascending through the **nine heavens** (重楼)?

If **True Water follows fluids downward** (真水随液下行),
Then the **tiger cannot unite with the dragon** (虎不能交龙);
If **True Yang follows *qi* upward** (真阳随气上升),
Then the **dragon cannot unite with the tiger** (龙不能交虎).

How then can one **obtain the Golden Germ** (黄芽)?

Zhōnglízi Says: The **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气),
When it arises, is like the **Great Sun emerging from the sea** (太阳之出海),
Mist and dew cannot obscure its light,
And **strong *qi* naturally forms the True One’s water** (气壮则真一之水自成).

The **heart’s fluids** (心之液),
When they arise, are like the **severe winter killing things** (严天之杀物),
A sigh or a breath cannot scatter their cold,
And **fluids formed, the True Yang *qi* naturally flourishes** (液成则正阳之气自盛),
Though their **strength and weakness cannot yet be determined** (强弱未可必).

Lüzi Says: The generation of *qi* and fluids **each has its proper time** (各有时).
When it is said that **"abundant *qi* brings abundant water"** (气盛则水盛),
And **"abundant fluids bring abundant *qi*"** (液盛则气盛),
Why then is **strength and decline not guaranteed** (何盛衰未之保)?

Zhōnglízi Says: The **kidneys’ *qi*** (肾之气) is **easily dispersed** (易散),
Thus the **True Tiger is difficult to obtain** (真虎难得);
The **heart’s fluids** (心之液) are **hard to gather** (难聚),
Thus the **True Dragon is easily lost** (真龙易失).

Lüzi Says: I wish the Master would **explain it thoroughly** (究言之),
So that students may **understand the method of the Great Elixir** (知大药之方).

Zhōnglízi Says: There are three **ailments** (疾):
If one **feeds and guards improperly** (餐卫失其宜),
Or **violates the rhythms of rest and activity** (起居违其时),
Then one **hurries toward illness** (趋於患),
And this is called **time-bound ailment** (时疾);

If one **does not preserve one’s essence** (不持其精),
Does not **cherish one’s spirit** (不颐其神),
And **recklessly indulges in desires** (而冒於情欲),
Then one **ages swiftly** (速於老),
And this is called **year-bound ailment** (年疾);

If **life and death energies are exhausted** (荣泣卫除),
And one **cannot restore themself** (不能自还),
Then one **surrenders to death** (委於死),
And this is called **body-bound ailment** (身疾).

Though the **worldly ailments** (时之疾) are known to all,
None **know how to halt aging and reverse death** (止老而却死).

The **washing of the intestines and replenishing of the flesh** (洗肠补肉),
The **replacing of the skull and extending of the limbs** (换顶续支),
These were the practices of the **ancient skilled physicians** (古之善医).

Who **recognizes that there are methods** (亦有方) to **return to youth and dwell in form** (返童驻形)?

There are two: **Internal Elixir** (内丹) and **External Elixir** (外丹).
I have heard that in ancient times, the **Highest Primordial Lord** (高上元君) transmitted the **External Elixir scripture** (外丹之经),
Which spoke of the **principles of Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent** (天地升降之理),
And the **suitability of the sun and moon’s waxing and waning** (日月往复之宜).

The **Master Guangcheng** (广成子) obtained it,
And taught it to **the Yellow Emperor** (黄帝),
Yet the Yellow Emperor, though long practicing, **could not achieve completion** (不能成).

Master Guangcheng said: Between the **heart and kidneys** (心肾),
There exists **True *qi* and True Water** (真气真水).
Within *qi* and water,
There exists **True Yin and True Yang** (真阴真阳),
When combined, they can be **compared to gold and stone** (可比金石).

Thus he **refined them in the Kunlun Mountains** (炼於崆峒之山),
Selected from **eight stones** (八石) and used **sand** (砂),
From which he **extracted mercury** (取汞);
Selected from **five metals** (五金) and used **lead** (铅),
From which he **extracted white gold** (取白金).

Mercury is the **Yang Dragon** (阳龙);
White gold is the **Yin Tiger** (阴虎).

He **used the heart’s fire** (心之火),
Which blazed like **sand** (砂);
The **kidneys’ water** (肾之水),
Which was **dark as lead** (玄如铅).

The **fire of the year** (年之火), at its proper time, **unites with Heaven and Earth’s strategy** (合乾坤之策);
The **fire of the month** (月之火), **waxes and wanes to suit the patterns of Wu and Wen** (损益以顺文武之宜).

His **furnace was threefold** (炉三成),
Its height **nine inches** (高九寸),
Square outside and round within,
To **draw the *qi* of the eight directions** (取八方之气),
Responding to the **four seasons’ signs** (应四时之候),
Thus it was the **Golden Cauldron** (金鼎).

Within it, **lead and mercury were stored like the lungs** (藏铅汞如肺),
And **sulfur was mixed like the spleen** (和硫黄如脾).

In three years, the **elixir was slightly perfected** (小成),
And could **remove ailments** (去疾);
In six years, the **elixir was fully perfected** (中成),
And could **extend life** (延年);
In nine years, the **elixir was completely perfected** (大成),
And could **transcend calamities and endure eternally** (浩劫长存).

Though few have achieved this since antiquity,
There is no other reason—
Some **fail to discern the qualities of metals and stones** (不辨金石之材),
Some **do not understand the fire’s timing** (不通火候),
Some **lack external methods** (外行不备),
Thus how can they **ever ingest it** (又安得而饵)?

Lüzi Says: The **External Elixir** (外丹) is **not sufficient to attain sainthood** (不足以入圣).
May I ask about the **Internal Elixir** (内丹)?

Zhōnglízi Says: The **External Elixir** (外丹) is **not so shallow** (岂可浅哉)?
The **kidneys** (肾) are the **root of *qi*** (气之根),
If the root is not deep, then the **branches cannot flourish** (叶不茂).
The **heart** (心) is the **source of fluids** (液之源),
If the source is not clear, then the **flow cannot be long** (流不长).

To **age and then study the Dao** (老而学道),
One must **necessarily rely on the five metals and eight stones** (资乎五金八石),
To **assist *qi* and refine the form** (助气炼形),
And only then is it possible.

To **depend on them for immortality** (恃之以宾天),
Is **indeed crude** (则亦陋矣).

Do you wish to **know the Internal Elixir** (内丹)?
Its **origin lies in the heart and kidneys** (本出乎心肾).

「The materials are but the **Dragon** (龙) and **Tiger** (虎) alone. Hence, when the Dragon and Tiger interact, they transform into the **Yellow Sprout** (黄芽);
When the Yellow Sprout matures, they then separate into **Lead** (铅) and **Quicksilver** (汞).

**Lǚzi** Says: Lead and Quicksilver are the External Elixir (外丹), yet you speak of them here—why is that?

**Zhōnglízi** Says: The treasure of **Embracing the One** (抱天一), the foremost of the five metals, is **Lead** (铅), the mother of **White Metal** (白金);
The treasure that **responds to the *Qi* of the Great Yang** (太阳), the foremost of the eight stones, is **Sand** (砂).
**Quicksilver** (汞) is its offspring (子), the White Metal within Lead that is difficult to extract (铅中之白金难取者),
And the Quicksilver within Sand that is easily lost (砂中之汞易失者).
Together, they form the **Supreme Treasure** (至宝).
This is but speaking of their outward forms (外者).

Now let us speak of their inward essence (内):
At the beginning of my formation (始胎), I reside in the **Pure Yin Palace** (纯阴之宫),
Where **Yin and Yang** (阴阳) have yet to differentiate,
And my **spirit** (神) is concealed within.
By **three hundred days** (三百日), the embryo is complete;
By **five thousand days** (五千日), the *Qi* is full.

I have observed the **Five Phases** (五行)—
At the start of my formation (始胎), it was but **essence** (精) and **blood** (血).
There was already water within me at the outset (先已有水),
And observing the **Five Viscera** (五藏),
My essence and blood form my **substance** (形).
There was already the **kidneys** (肾) within me at the outset (先已有肾).
Within the **kidney-water** (肾水), hidden from the very beginning of conception (受胎之初),
Is the **True *Qi*** (真气) of the union (交合).
This is my **Internal Lead** (内铅).

Within the **kidneys** (肾), *Qi* is generated (生气),
And within that *Qi*, there is the **True One Water** (真一之水)—
This is called the **Tiger** (虎).
The **White Metal** (白金) of my Internal Lead,
The **kidney-*Qi*** (肾之气) passes to the **liver-*Qi*** (肝之气),
The **liver-*Qi*** (肝之气) passes to the **heart-*Qi*** (心之气),
And the **heart-*Qi**, reaching the **Great Pole** (太极), generates **fluids** (液).
Within the fluids, there is the **True Yang *Qi*** (正阳之气)—
This is my **Internal Quicksilver** (内汞).
The **fluids of the heart** (心之液), this is my **Internal Sand** (内砂).
The **True One Water** (气中真液之水) within the *Qi*
And the **True Yang *Qi*** (液中正阳之气) within the fluids combine,
Accumulating to form the embryo (胎),
And passing to the **Yellow Court** (黄庭).
If the **fire is applied correctly** (进火不差),
Then the embryo will transform into the **Immortal** (仙化).

**Lǚzi** Says: Then how does one extract the **White Metal** (白金) from **Internal Lead** (内铅)?
And how does one obtain the **Quicksilver** (汞) from **Internal Sand** (内砂)?
When Quicksilver becomes Sand and White Metal becomes Treasure—
May I hear of this?

**Zhōnglízi** Says: **Internal Lead** (内铅) is the **True *Qi* of Yin and Yang** (阴阳之真气), the **pure and unadulterated** (纯粹不杂).
Once the form is established (形既成矣), the *Qi* is stored within it (其气藏乎)!
The **kidneys** (肾) on either side face each other,
Their *Qi* ascending together (同升於气),
This is the **Primordial Yang *Qi*** (元阳之气).
Within the *Qi*, there is water—
This is the **True One Water** (真一之水).
The water ascends with the *Qi*,
And when the *Qi* ceases, the water ceases;
When the *Qi* disperses, the water disperses.
The two combined (二者合焉),
This is the **Dragon and Tiger interacting to transform into the Yellow Sprout** (龙虎交而变黄芽),
And thus the **Great Medicine** (大药) is formed.

Hence, the **True One Water** (真一之水),
Storing the **True Yang *Qi*** (正阳之气) within,
Is like the embryo (犹胎哉)!
At first, it is **Yin retaining Yang** (阴留阳);
Next, it is **Yang refining Yin** (阳炼阴).
Thus, *Qi* becomes **essence** (精),
Essence becomes **Quicksilver** (汞),
Quicksilver becomes **Pearl** (珠),
Pearl becomes **Sand** (砂),
And Sand becomes **Golden Elixir** (金丹).
The **True *Qi*** (真气) spontaneously arises,
And when refined, it becomes **Spirit** (神).
The **Fire Dragon** (火龙) emerges from the **Great Darkness Crossroads** (大昏之衢),
And the **Mystic Crane** (玄鹤) ascends to the **Penglai Domain** (蓬莱之都).

**Lǚzi** Says: When form unites with form (以形交形), form combines to generate form (形合生形);
When *Qi* unites with *Qi* (以气合气), *Qi* combines to generate *Qi* (气合生气).
The number of cycles (数) does not exceed **thirty weeks** (三十旬),
This is how humans benefit (受用),
And there are distinctions between male and female (男女别焉).
What is my **Elixir** (丹) like?

**Zhōnglízi** Says: The **father’s essence** (父精) enters first,
And the **mother’s blood** (母血) follows.
The blood envelops the essence—
This is the **female** (女).
The female is **Internal Yang, External Yin** (内阳外阴),
With the blood on the outside (血在外).
The **mother’s blood** (母血) enters first,
And the **father’s essence** (父精) follows.
The essence envelops the blood—
This is the **male** (男).
The male is **Internal Yin, External Yang** (内阴外阳),
With the essence on the outside (精在外).

The so-called **blood** (血),
Generated from the **heart** (心),
Lacks the **True Yang *Qi*** (正阳之气);
The so-called **essence** (精),
Generated from the **kidneys** (肾),
Contains the **True Yang *Qi*** (正阳之气),
Which is the **root of Quicksilver** (汞之本).

Combining the **True One Water** (真一之水)
And entering it into the **Yellow Court** (黄庭),
Quicksilver is **cooked with Lead’s broth** (铅之汤),
And Lead is **refined with Quicksilver’s fire** (汞之火).
If Lead is not cooked with Quicksilver,
It cannot **release the True One Water** (发真一之水);
If Quicksilver is not refined with Lead,
It cannot **transform into Pure Yang *Qi*** (变纯阳之气).

**Lǚzi** Says: Quicksilver is **True Yang** (正阳),
And it is the **True One Water** (真一之水) that forms its embryo (胎).
When it reaches the **Yellow Court** (黄庭),
The Dragon and Tiger have already united (龙虎已交合),
And Yin and Yang have both **settled** (两止).
If you cook it with Lead (以铅烹之),
Will it not **deplete the Yin** (阴枫) and harm the **Lower Elixir Field** (下元)?
How can you say that *Qi* within generates *Qi*,
And thus forms the **Great Medicine** (大药)?

**Zhōnglízi** Says: The **kidney-*Qi*** (肾之气),
When infused into the **heart-*Qi*** (心之气),
Reaches its peak and generates **fluids** (液),
Within which the **True Yang *Qi*** (正阳之气) harmonizes with the **True One Water** (真一之水)—
This is called the **Dragon and Tiger’s union** (龙虎交合).

The **daily accumulation** (日之所得),
If placed in the Yellow Court like a **grain of millet** (黍),
Is called the **Golden Elixir, Great Medicine** (金丹大药).
What is the **Yellow Court** (黄庭)?
It lies beneath the **stomach** (胃之下),
Above the **bladder** (膀胱之上),
North of the **heart** (心之北),
South of the **kidneys** (肾之南),
West of the **liver** (肝之西),
And beside the **lungs** (肺之束).
Above, it is **clear and pure** (上清),
Below, it is **murky and turbid** (下浊).
Its outer appearance corresponds to the **four colors** (四色),
Its capacity holds **two pints** (二升),
And its pathways connect to the **eight waters** (八水).

Once the **medicine is placed** (药) within,
And the **fire is not applied** (火不进),
It will **scatter and fail to settle** (散而不能止).
If the fire is applied (火进),
But the medicine does not **harvest it** (之采),
Then the **Yang within Yin cannot settle** (阴中之阳不能止),
And it will merely **exhaust the kidney-*Qi*** (特发举肾之气),
To **inflame the Lower Elixir Field** (炎乎下元) alone.

Thus, the **harvesting of the medicine** (药之采),
Must correspond to the **advancement of the fire** (有时火之进).
There are **cycles** (数) in which one **borrows *Qi* from Lead** (先於铅中假气)
To **advance the fire** (进火),
And thus **strengthen the Great Medicine** (使大药坚固),
To **settle it in the Lower Elixir Field** (镇乎下田)—
This is called **harvesting and supplementing** (采补).

If one can **extract Lead** (抽其铅)
And **augment Quicksilver** (增其汞),
Then **flying gold crystals** (飞金晶) will appear behind the elbow (肘后).
If Lead is extracted (铅抽矣),
But Quicksilver is not augmented (汞不增),
Then it will merely **return essence to nourish the earthen pill** (还精以补泥丸) alone.
The **True *Qi*** (真气) cannot generate,
And the **Yang Spirit** (阳神) cannot manifest.

If Quicksilver is augmented (汞增矣),
But Lead is not extracted (铅不抽),
Then it will merely **refine Quicksilver** (徒以炼汞),
And **supplement the Elixir Field** (补丹田) to extend one’s life (益寿) may be possible.
Yet the **Sand cannot transform** (砂不能变),
And the **Golden Elixir cannot be formed** (金丹不能成).」

Master Lü said: *"We rely on the water within qi to harvest the medicine, and borrow the qi within Lead to advance the fire—that is all. But what is the principle behind extracting and augmenting it?"*

Master Zhōnglí Child replied: *"Metals and stones are external medicines—without inherent vitality. Qi and fluids are internal medicines—with inherent vitality. Though lacking vitality, [external medicines] can still act upon things to produce treasures, and dwell within humans to prolong life. But what of those with vitality? Over days and months, they recognize the times of union, drawing qi from the treasury to refine qi into spirit.

The grand [principles] of Heaven and Earth, the luminous [cycles] of sun and moon, the external [agents] of metals and stones, and the internal [agents] of qi and fluids—once extracted, one must know how to augment them; once augmented, one must know how to extract them. This is the root of transformation and generation.

At the Winter Solstice, Yang ascends from Earth. Earth extracts its Yin, so Great Yin is extracted to become *Jué-Yin*, and Minor Yang is augmented to become *Yáng-Míng*. *Jué-Yin* is extracted to become Minor Yin, and *Yáng-Míng* is augmented to become Great Yang. If not so, there would be no cold to transform warmth, and warmth would not transform into heat.

At the Summer Solstice, Yin descends to Heaven. Heaven extracts its Yang, so Great Yang is extracted to become *Yáng-Míng*, and Minor Yin is augmented to become *Jué-Yin*. *Yáng-Míng* is extracted to become Minor Yang, and *Jué-Yin* is augmented to become Great Yin. If not so, there would be no heat to transform frost, and frost would not transform into cold.

This is the verification of Heaven and Earth’s six *qi*—their rising, descending, extracting, and augmenting.

As for the moon transforming into the sun’s *hún* (魂), and the sun transforming into the moon’s *pò* (魄): in the first ten days, the moon extracts its *pò*, and the sun augments its *hún*, so its essence flourishes and illuminates the lower earth. If not so, the treasury would lack what generates the *upper arc* (上弦), and the *upper arc* would not transform into the *full moon* (既望).

As for the moon returning to its Yin *pò*, and the sun collecting its Yang essence: in the latter ten days, the sun extracts its *hún*, and the moon augments its *pò*, so its radiance wanes and the Yin *pò* swells. If not so, there would be no *full moon* to transform into the *lower arc* (下弦), and the *lower arc* would not transform into the *waning* (晦朔).

This is the verification of the sun and moon’s reciprocal cycles—the nine and six transformations—of extracting and augmenting.

Now, a person’s Lead is from Heaven and Earth before all else, arising from *Tàishǐ* (太始) and only then giving birth to the *Tàizhì* (太质), the mother of myriad substances. *Tàizhì* generates *Tàisù* (太素)—this is its form! Thus it becomes the gold within water—this is its function!

Therefore it is said: *‘Water within fire is the ancestor of the Five Phases, the root of the Great Dao.’*

When Quicksilver is augmented, Lead is extracted—this is not about internal and external, but about ascending from the Lower Elixir Field to the Upper Elixir Field. This is the *flying gold crystals* behind the elbow! This is the *River Chariot* rising and the *Dragon and Tiger* racing!"

「Returning the essence to nourish the *nǐwán* (泥丸)—the *mìngmén* (命门)! Lead, having been restored, is then extracted; Quicksilver, however, descends from the center. This is the transition from the Middle Elixir Field to the Lower Elixir Field.

First, the Dragon and Tiger unite, and then they merge to transform into the *Huángyá* (黄芽)—this is the reversal of the Five Phases! Next, Lead is extracted and Quicksilver is augmented to cultivate the *Tāixiān* (胎仙), enacting the cyclical return of the Three Elixir Fields. Without this process, the Dragon and Tiger would not unite, and the *Tāixiān* would not transmute.

Master Lü said: *"True Lead and true Quicksilver are the means by which one extracts and augments. I wish to hear their details."*

Master Zhōnglí (钟离) replied: *"Quicksilver must be used with Lead, yet it cannot be used by Lead—thus, Lead must be extracted and directed into the Upper Palace. If the Original *Qi* (元气) does not return, the essence will gather in the *nǐwán* (泥丸), and the sun’s acquired essence will be spent. When the yin of Quicksilver is exhausted and its yang is pure, its transformation occurs: essence becomes sand, sand becomes gold—this is called True Lead. True Lead is that which my true *Qi* (真气) unites with and obtains.

When the gold crystals descend into the *Dāntián* (丹田), they ascend to refine the form, and their bones take on a golden hue. Upon reaching True Lead, it ascends into the Inner Treasury (*Nèifǔ* 内府), and its body becomes white. Thus, it is said: ascending from below and descending from above, refining the Elixir and the form—all are the workings of the gold essence’s return! Moving from front to back, and back to front, burning the body and uniting the *Qi*—all are the functions of true *Qi* (真气) in transformation. Without extraction and augmentation, one could never reach this stage!

Master Lü asked: *"Ascending from above, descending from below, moving forward from behind and backward from front—what are the stages for this?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"At times, one may ascend but never descend; at times, one may extract but never augment. The fluid movement of ascending and descending without force is the power of the River Chariot.

Master Lü asked: *"What is the River Chariot?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"The human body, with its lesser yang and greater yin, is such that water resides abundantly within. Thus, my chariot moves through water. What does the chariot carry? It bears my Original Yang *Qi* (元阳之气) and turns with it. Its movement, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, sometimes moving backward, sometimes forward, harnesses the Eight *Qióng* (琼)—the refined essences—and races across the Four Seas.

When ascending to Heaven, it rises and enters *Kūnlún* (昆仑); when crossing to the other shore (*Jìzhì* 既济), it descends and races toward the *Fèngquè* (凤阙). It circulates through the Original Yang *Qi*, entering the *Lígōng* (离宫) directly, bearing true *Qi* and returning to the *Shòufǔ* (寿府) by indirect paths. It traverses the Nine Regions, perpetually cycling through the Three Elixir Fields. When the Dragon and Tiger unite, the *Huángpó* (黄婆) guides them. Entering the *Huángtíng* (黄庭), once Lead and Quicksilver are separated, the *Jīnnán* (金男) remains.

Entering the *Jīnquè* (金阙), the *Yùquán* (玉泉) and the golden elixirs are all borne and gathered. Thus, the Five Phases rely upon it to manifest, and the Two *Qi* (二气) depend upon it to converge. Following the seasons to descend with effort, all are the applications of this chariot.

Now, to nourish yang and refine yin—undertaking matters without restraint—who can achieve this? When *Tiān* (天) and *Kūn* (坤) are not yet pure, who can cycle their yin and yang? When the cosmos is not yet complete, who can harmonize the circulation of *Qi* and blood? To draw in from the outside and rotate within, transforming the pure and refined *Qi* of Heaven and Earth to connect with my Original Yang *Qi*—who can achieve this? To ascend from the common to the sage, rotating the true and genuine yin-yang *Qi* to refine and supplement my Original Spirit (*Yuánshén* 元神)—who can achieve this? All are the chariot’s movements.

Master Lü said: *"This chariot—what is its purpose? Are there methods to its operation?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"The River Chariot originates from the North, in the pure water of the *Zhēnwù* (正水). It is the spirit of the true *Qi* of the kidneys, which generates pure *Qi*. When *Tiān* (天) repeatedly seeks *Kūn* (坤), it produces *Kǎn* (坎). *Kǎn* is water, the essence of yin. Once yang seeks yin, the yang returns, bearing the yin back to its place. In its passage, it encounters *Gèn* (艮), *Zhèn* (震), and *Xùn* (巽). It seeks yin through yin, taking yin from yin. It then moves into *Lí* (离), receiving yang and generating, thus bearing yin into yang.

When *Kūn* (坤) repeatedly seeks *Tiān* (天), it produces *Lí* (离). *Lí* is fire, the essence of yang. Once yin seeks yang, the yin returns, embracing the yang back to its place. In its passage, it encounters *Kūn* (坤), *Duì* (兑), and *Tiān* (天). It seeks yang through yang, taking yang from yang. It then moves into *Kǎn* (坎), receiving yin and generating, thus bearing yang into yin.

Upon gathering the elixir from the Nine Palaces above, once obtained, it descends into the *Huángtíng* (黄庭), extracts Lead from below the *Qūjiāng* (曲江), and bears the *Bān* (般) to ascend into the Inner Treasury. The essence of gold and jade originates from the Elixir of Return. Bearing and circulating it can refine the form, causing water to ascend and move—this is the source of the fire for both lords and subjects. Bearing and circulating it can produce the Elixir, causing fire to descend and advance—thus, the Five *Qi* (五气) converge at the Original Center (*Yuán* 元), and the Three *Huā* (花) gather at the apex!

Bearing and circulating it must also follow its seasons and numbers, for when the spirit gathers, the demon arrives. Using true fire to consume the body, the Three *Péng* (彭) perish, and the elixir is ready—thus the sea dries up. Circulating the *Xiájiāng* (霞浆) for bathing, the Eight Waters ripple in response.

Master Lü said: *"I now wander its shores but have not yet fathomed its depths. I wish to further discuss this."*

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"The Five Phases reversed, the Dragon and Tiger uniting to transform into the *Huángyá* (黄芽)—this is the Small River Chariot. The Three Elixir Fields returning in cycles, the flying gold crystals behind the elbow, returning essence into the *nǐwán* (泥丸), extracting Lead and augmenting Quicksilver to produce the Great Elixir—this is the Great River Chariot.

The Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the *Huángyá* (黄芽), and Lead and Quicksilver unite to form the Great Elixir. True *Qi* (真气) generates, and the Five *Qi* converge at the Original Center (*Yuán* 元). The Original Yang Spirit (*Yuánshén* 元神) is complete, and the Three Spirits (*Sānshén* 三神) ascend into the Inner Treasury."*

「The *Zǐjīndān* (紫金丹) is completed, like the *Xuánhè* (玄鹤) taking flight; the *Bái yù gǒng* (白玉汞) is refined, like the *Huǒlóng* (火龙) rising. Whether it moves outward or inward with ease, or travels forth and back without obstruction—this is the *Zǐhé Chē* (紫河车).

This chariot has three stages of attainment: upper, middle, and lower. After these three stages, there are three more:

1. The *Huǒjǔ* (火聚)—when the mind directs its intention, using it to cure illness; its name is *Shǐzhě Kù qí jìjì* (使者库其既济). From above to below, yin and yang align in harmony, water and fire coexist in balance. In stillness, one hears the thunderous sounds of *léitíng* (雷霆), and its name is *Léichē* (雷车);

2. When the mind is enslaved by sensory perceptions and nature is dragged by emotions, the Original Yang *Qi* (元阳之气) is dispersed by external influences from within to without, ceaselessly. Over time, it declines, and the *Bāxié Wǔyì* (八邪五疫) then circulate and enter the *Qìfǔ* (气府). The Original Yang cannot resist them, so age and illness arise, and illness leads to death. Its name is *Pòchē* (破车).

Master Lǚ asked: *"The *Zǐhé Chē* (紫河车)—what is its origin and how does it operate?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"First, yin and yang are harmonized; then, water and fire are gathered and dispersed. Afterward, medicines are gathered and fire is refined, Lead is extracted and Quicksilver is augmented. Thus, the Small River Chariot must naturally proceed. When the golden crystals enter the *Dǐng* (顶), and the *Huángtíng* (黄庭) elixir is formed, the Three Passes are struck in one blow, ascending directly into the Inner Treasury. The latter rises while the former is gathered, refining from below and nourishing from above—thus, the Great River Chariot must naturally proceed. The essence of gold and jade, known as *Huándān liànxíng* (还丹炼形), is the refining of form.

Refining form comes before refining *Qi*; refining *Qi* comes before refining spirit. When spirit and Dao are united, only then does one attain completion—this is the *Zǐhé Chē* (紫河车).

Master Lǚ asked: *"Refining form into *Qi*, refining *Qi* into spirit, and refining spirit to unite with Dao—this is beyond what I dare to inquire. I venture to ask: what is meant by *Huándān* (还丹)?"*

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"The *Dān* (丹) is neither color nor flavor—it refers to the *Dāntián* (丹田)! It has three distinct aspects: the upper is called *Shénshè* (神舍), the middle is *Qìfǔ* (气府), and the lower is *Jīngxué* (精穴).

From *Jīng* (精) arises *Qi* (气), and thus *Qi* resides in the middle *Dān* (丹); from *Qi* arises spirit, and thus spirit resides in the upper *Dān*; when true water and true *Qi* merge to form essence, then essence resides in the lower *Dān*. Which of these two lacks it?

Only when the *Qi* is generated in the *shèn* (肾) but has not yet ascended to the Original Center (*Zhōngyuán* 中元); only when the spirit is stored in the heart but has not yet ascended to the Upper Treasury (*Shàngyuàn* 上院. Therefore, the essence cannot return, and the three *Dān* (丹) remain unfulfilled—what use are they?

Master Lǚ asked: *"Within the mysterious center, who does not possess life? If life lacks essence, it is not my *Qi*—is it my Original *Qi* from the time of conception? If there is no essence, there is no *Qi*; if there is no *Qi*, there is no spirit—is it my Original spirit from the time of conception?"* Thus, essence, *Qi*, and spirit are the treasures of the Three Elixir Fields (*Sāndiàn* 三田).

To remain perpetually in the Three Treasures (*Sān Guān* 三官), one must also follow the Dao. Upper, middle, and lower.

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"When *Qi* is generated in the center of the *shèn* (肾), there is true *Yī* (真一) water within it. If one returns this water to the lower *Dān* (丹), essence nurtures the *línggēn* (灵根), and *Qi* will naturally arise. When essence is generated in the center of the heart, there is Original Yang *Qi* within it. If one returns this *Qi* to the middle *Dān*, *Qi* nurtures the *língyuán* (灵源), and spirit will naturally arise. When spirit is gathered into unity, it merges with Dao, and by returning to the upper *Dān*, one attains immortality.

Master Lǚ asked: *"Returning (还)—this is to go forth and yet have a destination. Its principles are profound and subtle; I have not yet fathomed them."*

Master Zhōnglí replied: *"Do you know of the returning of the elixir? There are small returns and great returns, seven-fold returns and nine-fold transformations, golden essence and jade essence, those that return lower elixir to upper elixir, those that return upper elixir to middle elixir, those that return middle elixir to lower elixir, those that return yang to yin, and those that return yin to yang. It is not merely about naming them—their timing and effects differ.

The so-called *small* (小) refers to the Original Center (*Shàngyuán* 上元). The lower Original Center (*Xiàyuán* 下元) is the master of the Five Viscera (*Wǔzàng* 五藏) and the root of the Three Elixir Fields (*Sāndiàn* 三田). Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water—following its natural order, it generates and draws forth what has not yet generated, like a mother nurturing her child.

Fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire—following its natural degree, it overcomes and supplements what has not yet been overcome, like husband and wife uniting in harmony. *Qi* and essence circulate in transformation, completing cycles from *zǐ* (子) to *wǔ* (午), where yin and yang are born; from *mǎo* (卯) to *yǒu* (酉), where yin and yang are at rest. In one day and one night, the lower elixir is returned. Those who cultivate the true way gather medicines and refine fire within this cycle, and thus the lower elixir is completed.

The so-called *great* (大) is when the Dragon and Tiger unite to transform into the *Huángyá* (黄芽), Lead is extracted and Quicksilver is augmented, and the Great Elixir is formed. The golden crystals arise from the *Xuánwǔ* (玄武) Palace, true *Qi* ascends beneath the *Yùjīng* (玉京), the River Chariot races across the peaks, and jade essence is poured into the crossroads. It enters the lower field and returns to the upper field, then returns again to the lower field. The latter rises while the former descends, completing its cycle. Those who cultivate the true way within this process awaken the Dragon and Tiger, make the golden crystals fly, nurture the embryo for immortality, and thus the lower elixir is completed.

The so-called *seven-fold return* (七返) is when the yang of the heart returns to the heart itself, and the yang of the lungs, generated from the heart, returns again to the heart—all without departing from the middle *Dān*.

As for the *nine-fold transformation* (九转), why is it so? The numbers of the Five Phases' generation are fifty-five: Heaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. Thus, one, three, five, seven, and nine are yang numbers, totaling twenty-five;」

「Two, four, six, eight, and ten are yin numbers, totaling thirty—thus the human body is fully composed.

Beginning from the kidneys, the Five Phases’ *generative* numbers are as follows: Water One, Fire Two; Wood Three, Metal Four; Earth Five. Here, the five numbers of generation are three yang and two yin.

Again, beginning from the kidneys, the Five Phases’ *transformative* numbers are: Water Six, Fire Seven; Wood Eight, Metal Nine; Earth Ten. Here, the five numbers of transformation are three yin and two yang.

Thus, Water corresponds to the kidneys, for it holds One and Six;
Fire corresponds to the heart, for it holds Two and Seven;
Wood corresponds to the liver, for it holds Three and Eight;
Metal corresponds to the lungs, for it holds Four and Nine;
Earth corresponds to the spleen, for it holds Five and Ten—each of these thus has its own yin and yang.

The yin reaches its extreme at Eight, flourishes at Two; hence, when *qi* arrives at the liver, the residual yin of the kidneys is exhausted.
When *qi* arrives at the heart, the *Taiji* generates yin, for Two resides in the heart and Eight in the liver.

The yang is fully spent at Nine, flourishes at One; hence, when the essence arrives at the lungs, the residual yang of the heart is exhausted.
When the essence arrives at the kidneys, the *Taiji* generates yang, for One resides in the kidneys and Nine in the lungs.

I harmonize the Dragon and Tiger, blending the heart’s *orthodox yang-qi*—this is the heart’s Seven.
The Seven returns to the *middle Dān* and descends into the *lower field*, nurturing the embryo of immortality, then returns to the heart—this is its seven-fold return.

As for the Two-Eight yin, how does it dissipate?
The *true-qi* arises, and the heart has no yin, thus exhausting the Two;
The *great medicine* forms, and the liver has no yin, thus exhausting the Eight.

When the liver’s pure yang aids the heart, the *qi* of Wood Three flourishes;
Since Seven has returned to the heart, it exhausts the lungs’ *receptive yin*, and the lungs’ Nine transforms to aid the heart—thus the Nine-Three yang grows long.

This is its nine-fold transformation.

Master Lü said: When the *golden essence* and *jade essence* meet at the Three Officials, and yin and yang alternate, what is this?

Master Zizhili replied: The ancients of supreme attainment called the lungs’ essence, when it enters the *lower field*, the *golden essence*;
The heart’s essence, when it enters the *middle field*, the *jade essence*.
They were not mistaken, yet they did not fully grasp the *mysterious mechanism*.

The lungs generate the kidneys, for Metal produces Water;
The kidneys overcome the heart, for Water subdues Fire.
Metal enters Water, Water enters Fire—how then can these be called *returning to the elixir*?

The *golden essence* is the lungs’ essence.
Its role as a *fetal sac*, its union with the Dragon and Tiger, its transmission to the *Yellow Court*—as the *great medicine* nears completion, it is drawn from the elbow’s rear, ascending and flying, its essence entering the *Upper Palace*, then descending back into the *middle Dān*, and again returning from the *middle Dān* to the *lower field*.

The *jade essence* is the kidneys’ essence.
It follows the *primordial qi* as it ascends, gathering at the heart;
Accumulated, it becomes *golden water*;
Lifted, it fills the *jade pool*;
Dispersed, it forms the *radiant flower*;
Refined, it becomes *white snow*.
When taken in, it enters from the *middle field* to the *lower field*, and if there is medicine, it can bathe the embryo of immortality;
When raised, it ascends from the *middle field* into the Four Limbs, and when the form is refined, it can transmute dust and bones.

If neither ascending nor descending, it cycles endlessly.
When yin reaches its extreme, yang is born, and within yang lies the *true One’s Water*—this water ascends with the yang, thus yin returns to yang;
When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, and within yin lies the *orthodox yang-qi*—this *qi* descends with the yin, thus yang returns to yin.

Thus, the *mending of the earthen pill* is the refining of the Nine Heavens, returning from below to above;
Having reached completion, it irrigates and nourishes, returning from above to the middle;
Refining the elixir and advancing the fire, it returns from the middle to below;
Refining the substance and consuming the form, it returns from below to the middle.

The Five Phases are inverted, and the Three Fields alternate—until the form is refined and *qi* transmuted, until *qi* is refined into spirit, ascending from the *lower field*.
Until it reaches the *middle field*, then ascending from the *middle field*.
Until it reaches the *upper field*, then ascending from the *upper field*.
Emerging through the *Heavenly Gate*, the three ascensions’ work is complete, entering the *Sacred Stream*—no further return is needed.

The forty-first chapter of *Dao Gun* concludes. #1: Original text reads 『大』, corrected according to *Ji Yao* edition.
The forty-first chapter of *Dao Gun* continues, as collected by Master Youzi Zeng.」

**Transmission of the Dao, Lower Section**

Lüzi said: *"Refining the form—what does this mean?"*
Zhōnglíqízi replied: *"The spirit is the master of the form; the form is the dwelling of the spirit. Within the form, essence generates qi, and qi generates spirit. Within the fluid, qi is born; within qi, fluid is born—this is the child-mother within the form. That which generates wood is water; that which generates fire is wood; that which generates earth is fire; that which generates metal is earth; that which generates water is metal. Thus, qi passes through child-mother, fluid flows through husband-wife—this is the yin-yang within the form.

Water transforms into fluid, fluid into blood, blood into essence—this is yin receiving yang to generate. When yin-yang lose their proper harmony, then tears, saliva, spittle, and sweat flow horizontally, and yin loses its power to generate.

Qi transforms into essence, essence into pearl, pearl into mercury, mercury into sand—this is yang receiving yin to complete. When yin-yang lose their proper harmony, then sickness, aging, death, and suffering arise, and yang cannot be perfected.

Thus, if yin is not obtained, yang does not generate; if yang is not obtained, yin does not complete. He who cultivates yang but neglects yin, refines the form but not the substance—how can he hope to endure forever?

Our initial embryo, born from yin within yin, constructs form from form. When gestation completes and the body matures—six feet in height—all belongs to yin. The primordial yang within us is but a grain of millet. When great, it can refine the form into qi, making an external body within the body.

Lüzi said: *"Then the form is yin—yin has substance. To make substance into non-substance, to transform the form into qi and enter the sacred—this is the method of refining. Retain qi within the form, and use qi to nourish the form. The highest attain the long life of eternal vision; the next extend their years. Three hundred sixty days make a year; thirty-six thousand years make an eon; thirty-six thousand eons make a great eon. Refining the form can reach the great eon."*

Yán Yuán wished to hear this. Zhōnglíqízi said: *"The human form—its length is five feet five inches. If uneven, measure by inches to define feet, the numbers of the Five Phases in generation.

Above the heart are the Nine Heavens; below the kidneys are the Nine Earths. From kidney to heart is eight inches four parts; this harmonizes with Heaven and Earth. From heart to the first tower’s first ring is also eight inches four parts; from the first ring to the crown is also eight inches four parts. From kidney to crown is two feet five inches two parts.

My primordial qi, filling and emptying in one day and night, completes three hundred twenty degrees. Each degree is two feet five inches two parts, totaling eighty-one zhang—matching the pure yang of nine nines. From kidney to crown is the five-fives of pure yang. Thus, primordial qi issues forth with the breath.

When it exhales, the *honoring* and *defensive* circulations open. The true qi of Heaven and Earth responds to the seasons, follows the nodes—sometimes converging, sometimes separating—endless in zhang and feet. When inhaled, the meridians and collaterals unfold. Thus, with each inhalation and exhalation, the true qi of the Three Realms—Heaven, Earth, and Man—travels through the Twelve Towers. One round trip is one breath; day and night, this accumulates thirteen thousand five hundred times.

Thus, my thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations send my primordial qi outward from the center; my thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations draw the true qi of Heaven and Earth inward from without. If the root is firm and primordial qi is substantial, then inhalation and exhalation can seize the true qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, refining qi with qi, dispersing and filling the body—clear becomes the *honoring*, turbid the *defensive*, all flowing freely; vertical are the meridians, horizontal the collaterals, all relaxed and unobstructed. Cold and heat cannot harm, and longevity follows.

If the root decays and vital essence diminishes, then the inhaled qi of Heaven and Earth pours forth. My primordial qi, reduced by nine nines, is instead seized by Heaven and Earth."*

Lüzi said: *"How can primordial qi be preserved from depletion to refine the form’s substance? How can Heaven and Earth’s true qi be seized?"*

Zhōnglíqízi replied: *"To conquer in battle, one’s army must be strong; to secure the people, the nation must be rich. Primordial qi is the army. Within, it can dissolve the form’s yin substance; without, it can seize Heaven and Earth’s qi. The body is the nation—what has form is abundant; what is formless is firm. All gates open without loss; one steed’s misstep yields many gains.

Sometimes forward, sometimes backward—to refine the substance, consume the form; sometimes upward, sometimes downward—to nourish the yang, dissolve the yin. The refining of Heaven and Earth has its time; the tempering of qi and fluid has its day.

Refine the form with jade fluid, and the Tortoise of Metal ascends, filling the body with white snow; refine with gold fluid, and the Thunder Chariot descends, filling the room with golden light.

When jade fluid ascends, the River Chariot carries it through the Four Great [elements]. First, the liver receives it, and its light shines in the eyes; next, the heart receives it, and its fluid hums in the mouth; next, the spleen receives it, and the skin becomes like congealed fat; next, the lungs receive it, and the nose emits heavenly fragrance, strengthening the face; finally, the kidneys receive it, returning twice to the original source, and its sound reaches the ears, strengthening the hair—gold fluid cannot advance further."*

If the alchemical elixir (*huandan*) has yet to return, its manifestation in the **Lord Fire** (*junhuo*) is called **Completion** (*jiji*). Once the elixir returns and again arises, it opposes the **True Yin** (*zhenyin*), and this is called **Refining the Essence** (*lianzhi*), for the Earth element subdues the Water.

If the **gold fluid** (*jinye*) resides in the Earth, it causes the **Yellow Emperor** (*Huangdi*) to **revert his light** (*huiguang*), thus aligning with the **Great Yin** (*Taiyin*), for Fire subdues Metal.

If the **gold fluid** (*jinye*) resides in the Fire, it makes the **Red Boy** (*Chizi*) share the furnace, and thus **purple vapor** (*zixi*) is born. When Fire flourishes in Water, is this not the **consumption of Yin within Yang** (*yangzhongxiaoyin*)?

Transforming the **gold elixir** (*jindan*) within the **Yellow Court** (*Huangting*), refining the **Yang Spirit** (*yangshen*) amidst the **Five Qi** (*wuqing*), then the **liver’s verdant qi** (*qingqi*) surges forth, the **lungs’ white hue** (*baise*) emerges, the **heart’s crimson light** (*chiguang*) appears, the **kidneys’ dark essence** (*heixiang*) ascends, and the **spleen’s yellow luster** (*huangcai*) responds in kind!

Then, it **faces the Central Source** (*zhongyuan*), follows the **Lord Fire** (*junhuo*), and **transcends the Inner Palace** (*neiyuan*). The **Lower Source** (*xiayuan*) is the **Yang within Yin** (*yinzhongyang*), its Yang having no counterpart in Yin; the **Central Source** (*zhongyuan*) is the **Yang within Yang** (*yangzhongyang*), its Yang having no origin in life; the **Great Elixir of the Yellow Court** (*Huangting Dayao*) is the **Yin exhausted, Yang in purity** (*yinjin yangchun*). The three ascend and converge at the **Spirit Official** (*shenguan*), so the **Lower Source** (*xiayuan*) is what the **Five Fluids** (*wuyi*) face; the **Central Source** (*zhongyuan*) is what the **Five Qi** (*wuqing*) face; the **Upper Source** (*shangyuan*) is what the **Three Yangs** (*sanyang*) face.

Master Lü asked: *"What is meant by ‘facing the Source’* (*chaoyuan*)?" The **Master Zhongli** (*Zhongli Zizi*) replied:

*"When chaos was divided into Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth were positioned and the Five Directions established. Each direction had its own sovereign (*di*), and each sovereign had two children (*zi*), one Yang, one Yin—these were called the **Two Sovereigns** (*er di*). They generated and nurtured each other, thus forming the **Five Phases** (*wuxing*), and the **Five Phases** then defined the **Six Qi** (*liuqing*)—the Three Yangs and Three Yins.

It is like the beginning of a human fetus: the **Essential Qi** (*jingqi*) is singular, then it divides and gives rise to the **Two Kidneys** (*er shen*). The left is **Primordial** (*xuan*), the right is **Receptive** (*pin*). The **Primordial** (*xuan*) ascends the **Qi** (*qi*) and transmits it upward to the liver; the **Receptive** (*pin*) gathers the **Fluids** (*ye*) and transmits them downward to the bladder. **Primordial** and **Receptive**—these emerge from **the Non-existent** (*wu*), and through **the Non-existent** (*wu*) become **the Existent** (*you*)!

Thus it is said: *"The Grain Spirit does not die"* (*gushenbudu*), this is called **Primordial-Receptive** (*xuanpin*), the **Gate of Primordial-Receptive** (*xuanpinmen*) being the **Root of Heaven and Earth** (*tian di gen*). From the kidneys arise the **Five Zang Organs** (*wuzang*) and **Six Fu Organs** (*liufu*).

The liver is **Wood** (*mu*), associated with **Geng-Xi** (*jia-yi*), positioned under the **Green Sovereign** (*Qingdi*) of the East; the heart is **Fire** (*huo*), associated with **Bing-Ding** (*bing-ding*), positioned under the **Red Sovereign** (*Chidi*) of the South; the lungs are **Metal** (*jin*), associated with **Geng-Xin** (*geng-xin*), positioned under the **White Sovereign** (*Baidi*) of the West; the spleen is **Earth** (*tu*), associated with **Wu-Ji** (*wu-ji*), positioned under the **Yellow Sovereign** (*Huangdi*) of the Center; the kidneys are **Water** (*shui*), associated with **Ren-Gui** (*ren-gui*), positioned under the **Black Sovereign** (*Heidi*) of the North.

Thus, **One Qi** (*yige*) moves the **Five Phases** (*wuxing*), and the **Five Phases** (*wuxing*) move the **Six Qi** (*liuqing*). The first among them are **Yin and Yang** (*yinyang*); the Yang has the **Yang within Yin** (*yinzhongyang*), and the Yin has the **Yin within Yang** (*yangzhongyin*).

The second are the **Five Phases** (*wuxing*), which include **Fire within Water** (*shui zhonghuo*), **Water within Fire** (*huo zhongshui*), **Metal within Water** (*shui zhongjin*), **Wood within Metal** (*jin zhongmu*), **Fire within Wood** (*mu zhonghuo*), and **Earth within Fire** (*huo zhongtu*).

In the human body, these **intermingle** (*jiahe*)?

Thus the **Two Qi** (*erqi*) divide into the **Six Qi** (*liuqing*), and the **Great Dao** (*Da Dao*) disperses into the **Five Phases** (*wuxing*).

When the sun reaches its southernmost point, **One Yang** (*yiyang*) arises and **faces the Qi** (*chaoqi*) to Heaven, and the **Five Directions’ Earthly Yangs** (*wufang diyang*) all flourish. One sovereign (*di*) presides over its command, while the other four assist. If the **Spring Command** (*chunling*) is active, and the **Black Sovereign** (*Heidi*) does not **retrieve its command** (*shouling*), then **cold cannot transform into warmth** (*han bunengbian wen*); if the **Red Sovereign** (*Chidi*) does not **fulfill its command** (*beiling*), then **warmth cannot transform into heat** (*wen bunengbian re*).

When the sun reaches its northernmost point, **One Yin** (*yiyin*) arises and **faces the Qi** (*chaoqi*) to Earth, and the **Five Directions’ Heavenly Yins** (*wufang tianyin*) all descend. One sovereign (*di*) presides over its command, while the other four assist. If the **Autumn Command** (*qiuling*) is active, and the **Red Sovereign** (*Chidi*) does not **retrieve its command** (*shouling*), then **heat cannot transform into frost** (*re bunengbian shuang*); if the **Black Sovereign** (*Heidi*) does not **fulfill its command** (*beiling*), then **frost cannot transform into cold** (*shuang bunengbian han*).

Thus, broadly speaking, between the sun and moon: when **One Yang** (*yiyang*) first arises, the **Five Zang Organs’ Qi** (*wuzangqi*) face the **Central Source** (*zhongyuan*); when **One Yin** (*yiyin*) first arises, the **Five Zang Organs’ Fluids** (*wuzangye*) face the **Lower Source** (*xiayuan*).

Then, the **Three Yangs** (*sanyang*)—the **Yang within Yin** (*yinzhongyang*), the **Yang within Yang** (*yangzhongyang*), and the **Yang within Yin-Yang** (*yinyangzhongyang*)—face the **Inner Palace** (*neiyuan*). The **Heart Spirit** (*xin shen*) returns to the **Heavenly Palace** (*tian gong*), all of which are called **facing the Source** (*chaoyuan*).

Although the **Dragon and Tiger** (*longhu*) unite to form the **Great Elixir** (*dayao*), and the **Great Elixir** (*dayao*) forms the **True Qi** (*zhengqi*), once the **True Qi** (*zhengqi*) arises, it is used within the year by the month, the month’s upper portion determining the **rise and decline** (*xingshuai*) of things; the day’s middle portion is used to **reckon affairs** (*shizhi*), the upper portion of the day to **count the rectified matters** (*shizhi*); the hour’s middle portion is used to **define the breath’s number** (*xisu*), the upper portion of the hour to **determine the resting count** (*xisu*).

In the **liver’s Qi** (*ganqi*), it **buds in Hai** (*hai*), **arises in Yin** (*yin*), **flourishes in Si** (*si*), and **wanes in Shen** (*shen*). In the **heart’s Qi** (*xinqi*), it buds in **Shen** (*shen*), arises in **Hai** (*hai*), flourishes in **Yin** (*yin*), and wanes in **Si** (*si*). In the **lungs’ Qi** (*feiqi*), it buds in **Si** (*si*), arises in **Shen** (*shen*), flourishes in **Hai** (*hai*), and wanes in **Yin** (*yin*). In the **kidneys’ Qi** (*shenqi*), spring follows the liver, summer follows the heart, autumn follows the lungs, and winter follows the kidneys.

The **Spleen’s Qi**—he who does not grasp this is why he falls ill so often!

The **day**, the **moon**, and the **hour**—when the **Three Yang** converge, they refine Yang with Yang, so that Yin does not arise within. When the **Three Yin** converge, they refine Yin with Yin, so that Yang does not disperse.

Once the **True Qi** is born, it refines the **Five Viscera** with pure Yang without ceasing. Each emits its proper color, and in one movement, it ascends to the **Celestial Pool**.

First, with the **kidneys’ lack of Yin**, the **Nine Rivers** have no waves. Next, with the **liver’s lack of Yin**, the **Eight Gates** are forever sealed. Next, with the **lungs’ lack of Yin**, **Metal and Fire** are forged in one furnace. Next, with the **spleen’s lack of Yin**, the **Jade Gate** remains unopened. Then, as the **True Qi** ascends, the **Four Qi** merge into one, and the **Golden Elixir** descends.

Can a single cup of water overcome the fire of a cartload of firewood? Indeed, when **water and fire** unite, they enter the **Divine Palace**, stabilizing the **inner contemplation**. With **one intent undivided**, the **spirit and cognition** become wondrous.

In stillness, one hears the **Supreme Music of the Dao**, as if asleep yet not asleep, wandering in the realm of **emptiness**—this is called **transcending the Inner Precinct**.

Thus, as the **Yang Spirit** gathers and returns upward to refine the **Dan**, refining the spirit to unite with the **Great Dao**, ascending through the **Heavenly Gate** and returning to the body, then **form aligns with Heaven and Earth**.

If one **sheds** it, they ascend to the **Purple Palace** to pay homage to the **Great Constellation**.

**Master Lü** said: Only then did I realize that refining the **form** can prolong life—must one who seeks **immortality** necessarily refine the **Qi**?

Those **eccentric adepts** practice **embryonic breathing** without elixirs. If they forcefully retain it, accumulating **extreme cold**, they may summon **void Yang** and incur **harsh illnesses**. They do not know that when the **embryonic immortal** is complete, **True Qi** is born, and **embryonic breathing** follows.

**Embryonic breathing** refines the **Qi**; refining the **Qi** cultivates the **spirit**.

**Master Lü** said: Those who refine the **Qi** must carefully select the **month within the year**, the **day within the month**, and the **hour within the day**. Seated in stillness, forgetting worldly concerns and nearness, at such times—when the mind and spirit are not yet free of delusion, when wisdom and cognition are flawed—if one fixates on **immortality**, the **heart** and **spirit** remain unsettled. Then what should be done?

**Master Zhōnglí** replied: You have not yet attained **inner contemplation**. Through **inner contemplation**, the **spirit and cognition** naturally cease.

**Master Lü** asked: What is **inner contemplation**?

**Master Zhōnglí** replied: It is what is called **"sitting and forgetting."**

Yet those **eccentric adepts**, in their copulation without knowing the proper time, in their practices without knowing the method, still hope to succeed through **inner contemplation**.

Thus, they forge **inner elixirs** with intent, gather **medicinal essences** in imagination, grind at the nose and swallow through the mouth, hoping to draw the **day, moon, and Earth** into the **Qi repositories**—like dreaming of receiving bribes.

Yet **Heaven and Earth** remain obstructed, and though time passes, they do not unite. Their failure lies in **scattered intent**.

A skilled observer, when focused on **vermilion and indigo**, sees not the **Great Peak**; a skilled listener, when focused on **reeds and strings**, hears not the **thunder**. The uses of **ears and eyes** are shallow indeed. How much more so the **heart**, which encompasses the **Six Directions** yet claims to achieve **inner contemplation and sitting-forgetting**?

At the onset of **inner contemplation**, it is like the **Yang ascending**. The visions are of:
- **Male**, **Dragon**, **Fire**, **Heaven**, **Clouds**, **Crane**, **Sun**, **Horse**, **Smoke**, **Mist**, **Chariot**, **Reins**, **Blossoms**, **Qi**—like **Yin descending**.

The visions are of:
- **Female**, **Tiger**, **Water**, **Earth**, **Rain**, **Tortoise**, **Moon**, **Ox**, **Metal**, **Mud**, **Boat**, **Leaves**.

Yet my **inner contemplation** extends beyond these!

The **Azure Dragon**, the **White Tiger**, the **Vermilion Bird**, the **Dark Warrior**, the **Five Sacred Peaks**, the **Nine Regions**, the **Four Seas**, the **Three Isles**, the **Golden Male**, the **Jade Female**, the **River Vehicle**, the **Double Tower**—all are **symbols established in the Void** to stabilize **spirit and cognition**.

Thus, before the **fish is caught**, the **net must not be lost**; before the **hare is taken**, the **track must not be abandoned**. Yet one must not cling to permanence, for it ends in an instant.

He who reaches **cessation of thought and extinction of imagination** attains **True Emptiness**, only then may he **converse with the True**.

For **inner contemplation** is the **foundation’s beginning**; one must daily diminish it, entering **mystery and subtlety**—this too comes from **inner contemplation**.

**Master Lü** asked: When **Dragon and Tiger unite** and **Yin and Yang pair**, how does their **inner contemplation** proceed?

**Master Zhōnglí** replied: In their visions, the **Nine Sovereign True Person** draws the **child in crimson robes** upward, while the **Nine Sovereign True Mother** draws the **maiden in dark robes** downward.

They meet in the **Yellow-Housed Courtyard**, where the **aged woman in yellow robes** mediates their union. Afterward, the **maiden descends**, the **child ascends**, and they part as if estranged.

Then the **aged woman** holds an object, like a **vermilion tangerine**, and casts it into the **Yellow House**, storing it in a **vessel of refined gold**.

What is the **child**? **Heaven’s Yang** seeks **Earth’s Yin**, returning to its root, bearing **Yang** upon **Yin** to meet its place.

What is the **maiden**? **Earth’s Yin** seeks **Heaven’s Yang**, returning to its root, embracing **Yin** around **Yang** to meet its place.

This is the **union of Kan and Li**, the **pairing of Yin and Yang**!

Like **flames blazing**, within them a **Dark Tiger** ascends; like **waters surging**, within them a **Red Dragon** descends.

The two contend before the **Pavilion**, the **wooden doors** gaping open, their **flames and waves** rising—there is a **Sovereign** who gazes upon them.

The **conflagration** scorches the heavens, and above, a **ten-thousand-zhang tide** swells. The **fire** rises and then falls, its **flames filling Heaven and Earth**, while the **Dragon and Tiger** coil and twist, entering the **vessel of refined gold**, descending into the **Yellow House**, as if placed in a **cage**.

This is the **vision of the Dragon and Tiger’s union**.

Luzi said: *"How is the vision of the Fire’s Advancement?"*

Zhongli Master replied: *"In this vision, there is a vessel. It is like a cauldron or a tripod, its distinctions between **Dark Tiger** and **Yellow Dragon**—its form like a chariot wheel—with the **Azure Dragon** on the left, the **White Tiger** on the right, the **Vermilion Bird** in front, and the **Dark Turtle** behind. Beside them stand two ministers in **purple robes**, holding **jewel-axes**, while below, attendants bearing **firewood** fan the **blaze** within the vessel.

Then comes a **Sovereign** in **scarlet robes**, riding a **red steed**, driving a **red cloud**, descending from the void to issue commands. His radiance ascends, piercing the heavens as if to emerge, but the **Celestial Gate** remains closed, and it descends again. The **blaze** spreads in all directions, and the ministers—those holding the **jewel-axes** and those riding the **steed**—vie to advance the **Fire**.

Thus, the water within the vessel loses its **qi** and congeals; the **pearls** in the water lose their luster and glow. This is the vision of the Fire’s Advancement.

Luzi said: *"Does it stop here?"*

Zhongli Master replied: *"Then **clouds and thunder** descend, while **flickering flames** ascend. Sometimes **precious flowers** rain down, and **auspicious winds** arise from the **Pure Capital**, bearing **celestial maidens**, **jade women**, **four-horse phoenixes**, and **feathered cranes** from the **layered clouds**. They present **golden platters** to offer **jade dew** and **misty nectar**, presenting them below to the **Sovereign**.

This is the vision of the **Golden Elixir’s return** and the **completion of the Refined Cinnabar**.*

The **Dragon and Tiger** pull the **chariot** through their **Fire**, surging upward past the **Three Gates**, each gate guarded by its own **sentries**. First, they **charge** with the **Dragon and Tiger’s assault**; then, they **assault** with the **Great Fire’s onslaught**..."

「When it is fully revealed, it reaches the base of Kunlun and stops at the Celestial Pool.

Sometimes, three cranes surge through the Three Heavens,
sometimes, two butterflies enter the Three Palaces,
sometimes, beyond the Five Clouds,
they bear the **Sacred Child** (承绛服之子) of the **Crimson Robe** (绛服) across the Celestial Gate,
or a **Golden Carriage** (金舆) with **Jade Axles** (玉辖) conveys the **Sovereign** (王者) and transcends the Three Realms.

This is the vision of the **Elbow-Later Flying Golden Crystal** and the **Great River Chariot** (大河车).

The **Red-Garbed Messengers** (朱衣使者), riding swift conveyances, traverse the wilds of the Nine Provinces.
They begin from Ji (冀) and enter Yi (一充),
from Yi (一兑) they enter Qing (青),
from Qing (青) they enter Xu (徐),
from Xu (徐) they enter Yang (扬),
from Yang (扬) they enter Jing (荆),
from Jing (刑) they enter Liang (梁),
from Liang (梁) they enter Yong (雍),
and from Yong (雍) they return again to Ji (冀).
Having encompassed the western, southern, and northern regions, they then stop at Yu (豫) before continuing their journey.

Those they summon are **gold and jade** (金玉);
those they traverse are **blocked and stagnant** (壅滞).
With one messenger bearing the command,
the Nine Provinces harmonize and communicate,
cycling endlessly without ceasing.

Sometimes they wander the Five Sacred Mountains, beginning at Changshan (常山);
sometimes they sail the Five Lakes, beginning at the Northern Marsh (北沼).
Sometimes the **Celestial Talismans** (天符) burst forth to summon the Five Emperors,
or the Five Decrees (五命) call the Five Marshals (五侯).

This is the vision of **Returning the Refined Cinnabar** (还丹).

When pearls and jade are cast to the earth,
sometimes they rain dew upon all things,
sometimes they cause tides in the rivers of the world,
sometimes the **Yang Vitality** (阳) arises and spreads across all beings,
sometimes **Fire** (火) blazes, scorching the heavens and earth,
sometimes **mist and clouds** surge through the cosmos.

This is the vision of **Refining the Form** (炼形).

Cranes depart their nests, dragons leave their coils,
the Five Emperors pay homage to the Celestial Sovereign.
The Five Clouds rise, the **four-horse phoenixes** soar through the boundless void,
they rest and wander the Celestial Highways.
Celestial flowers fall, celestial music plays,
golden radiance blazes in the **palaces of the immortals** (官).

This is the vision of **Homage to the Primordial** (朝元).
After Homage to the Primordial, then comes **Inner Contemplation** (内观).

Lüzi said: *"What is Inner Contemplation like?"*

Zhōnglízi replied: *"Inner Contemplation is the method of the transformations of yin and yang. It knows no time or day, no fixed rules. One sits upright in a quiet chamber, day and night, discerning the **Yang Spirit** (阳神) and banishing the **Yin Ghosts** (阴鬼). This is the Dao of the Nine Years of Bodhidharma and the Six Years of Zhùqián. How difficult it is not!"*

At first, the **Purple River Chariot** (紫河之车) moves downward from above and enters the Celestial Palace. The Celestial Palace is a realm of dazzling splendor. When the cultivator of the True Way grows accustomed to austerity and finds contentment in simplicity and detachment, then they take delight in it—yet they do not realize it originates from within themselves.

Thus, their form lingers and cannot be shed. How much more so the **Three Corpses** (三尸), **Seven Spirits** (七魄), **Nine Worms** (九虫), and **Six Bandits** (六贼)? If the eight deaths are not averted, then where can they find peace? If the practitioner finds peace, they will not be restrained.

Thus, from intention arises the image, from the image arises the realm, and the cultivator of the True Way is swept into error—this is indeed something to greatly fear.

Lüzi said: *"Inner Contemplation gathers the Yang Spirit, refining the spirit to transcend the Inner Precincts (内院), leaping upward and passing through the Celestial Gate (天门), directly ascending to the ranks of the Saints. Their departures and arrivals are not misaligned with the Way, their comings and goings do not rise to the level of artificial welcome. Prolonged contemplation merges spirit with form, and ascension becomes boundless wandering. The **Eight Immortals’ Vessels** (方壶) truly attest to the power of Inner Contemplation.*

*Yet how can one avoid being swept into error?"*

Zhōnglízi replied: *"There is no other way—if one hears the Dao yet lacks resolute aspiration, they will be lost to worldly things. Yet its demons are tenfold, its difficulties ninefold. Before the Great Elixir is complete, there are cold and heat; before True Qi arises, there is hunger and thirst. Thus, the pressure of clothing and food is the first difficulty.

Within one’s family, there must be elders—father or elder brother—who restrain one’s desire to leave and seek the Dao, the second difficulty.

Humans generate love through love, and only then do bonds form. Parents demand filial duty, wives demand affection, and these become shackles, the third difficulty.

Wealth and honor are what people desire, yet to abandon them and turn to the silent, empty Way is the fourth difficulty.

In youth, one may hear the Dao, but indulgence in excess and laziness in leisure leads to early death, the fifth difficulty.

Eager to seek a teacher, yet true masters are hard to find. Some are taken in by words, others by appearance, the sixth difficulty.

A false teacher presents deviant teachings, flashing the light of **burning fire** (燸火) while unaware of the brightness of the sun and moon, deaf to the thunder of heaven while mistaking the croaking of frogs for its voice, the seventh difficulty.

Morning intentions shift by evening, sitting and rising forget their purpose, delighting in fleeting moments yet weary of endurance, ultimately succumbing to slackness, the eighth difficulty.

In youth, one pursues fame and profit; in old age, one clings to private desires. The body loses years, the year loses months, the month loses days—this is the ninth difficulty.

The eyes delight in myriad colors, the ears indulge in the Six Harmonies (六乐), tastes grow ever more refined, and emotions surge while qi becomes dissipated—these are the **Six Bandit Demons** (六贼魔).

Carved walls and towering halls, gold and jade displayed in rows—this is the **Wealth Demon** (富魔).

The splendor of carriages and attendants, the beauty of plumes and silks, hoarding silver and gold, trailing sashes and ribbons—this is the **Nobility Demon** (贵魔).

The gentle warmth of spring, the lengthening days of summer, sudden fierce winds and torrential rain, great thunder and hail—sometimes one rejoices and delights, sometimes one grieves and weeps—this is the **Emotional Demon** (一情魔).

The household suffers loss, the home is plagued by illness, the funeral is yesterday’s affair—this is the **Filial Affection Demon** (恩爱魔).

Falling into boiling cauldrons, tumbling into perilous precipices, seized by raptors, bitten by venomous creatures, robbed by bandits—this is the **Calamity Demon** (患难魔).

The Ten Directions under the sun, the Three Pure Ones and Jade Emperor, the Five Peaks and Eight Kings, the Four Celestial Animals and Seven Stars—this is the **Saintly Demon** (圣贤魔).

The **Dryad’s Spear** (干将) and **Board Halberd** (板戟) arrayed in battle—this is the **War Demon** (兵魔).

The **Immortal Chang’e** and **Jade Maiden** each leading their retinues—this is the **Female Music Demon** (女乐魔).

A beautiful woman adorned in fine silks, her gaze beckoning as if divinely granted—this is the **Female Beauty Demon** (女色魔).*

*The demons that obstruct us are threefold: first, they appear in the realm; second, they appear in dreams; third, they appear in Inner Contemplation. If one recognizes them in the realm, their resolve will be steadfast. If one recognizes them in dreams, their spirit will not be confused, their intentions will not scatter. If one recognizes them in Inner Contemplation, using the fire of **Samādhi** (三昧) to burn away the form, the demons will be annihilated.*

*Thus, one employs the Purple River Chariot to transport the Yang Spirit, transcending the Inner Precincts and returning to the Celestial Palace.*

Lüzi said: *"Are there fixed methods? Are there fixed times?"*

Zhōnglí Master said to Lüzi: *"The Dao has twelve methods: first, harmonizing yin and yang; second, gathering and dispersing water and fire; third, merging the Dragon and Tiger; fourth, refining the supreme elixir; fifth, the *Elbow Posture* (肘后) of flying gold crystals; sixth, the *Celestial Essence Return* (玉液还丹); seventh, the *Celestial Essence Refining the Form* (玉液炼形); eighth, the *Golden Elixir Return* (金液还丹); ninth, the *Golden Elixir Refining the Form* (金液炼形); tenth, the *Morning of the Primordial Refining the Qi* (朝元炼气); eleventh, the *Inner Contemplation Exchange* (内观交换); and twelfth, the *Transcendence and Dissolution of the Form* (超脱分形).*

*There are three fixed times: yearly, monthly, and daily. Yearly, one follows the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang rising and descending; monthly, one follows the Dao of the sun and moon’s vital *qi* coming and going; daily, one follows the eight *guà* (卦) and eight cardinal directions (八正), with ten thousand ten having twelve branches and one hundred *kè* (刻) making up six thousand divisions.*

*When one practices these methods, the first cycle begins: licentious and evil *qi* departs, and external conduct is refined. Next, the gold crystals are abundant, and the mind’s distractions are purged. Next, the *Heart Sutra* (心经) surges forth, and sweet nectar flows from the mouth. Next, yin and yang clash within the abdomen, their impact resounding like thunder. Next, the soul and spirit are restless, and sleep is filled with frequent awakenings. Next, the six *fǔ* (府) and four limbs may suffer slight ailments, yet they heal without medicine or herbs. Next, the *Dantian* (丹田) warms at night, the body becomes refined and clear, the eyes radiant with divine light, and sleep is undisturbed by external intrusions—like embracing an infant to return. Next, the *Golden Lock* (金关) and *Jade Bolt* (玉锁) solidify, their defense unyielding, and sleep remains unbroken. Next, thunderous *qi* courses through the joints, and a spontaneous perspiration arises. Next, the *Celestial Essence* (玉液) is simmered and rinsed, forming a congealed cream. Next, the *Numinous Elixir* (灵液) thickens into a salve, and the stench of decay is banished. Next, the bones grow light, and the *Divine Chamber* (神室) transforms—movement becomes swift and graceful like a *jīng* (鴂) bird. Next, external circumstances cannot sway one, and cravings are extinguished. Next, the *True Qi* (真气) enters into things, and one can cure illnesses. Next, *Inner Contemplation* (内观) becomes lucid. Next, the pupils glow brightly, the hair renews like a child’s, and one regains the vigor of youth. Next, the *qi* is full yet does not diminish, and longevity is boundless. Next, the skin and flesh radiate with luster, the spirit refined and resplendent, the *Sacred Elixir* (圣丹) forms, and the *Numinous Elixir* (灵液) exudes its fragrance. Next, one perceives the subtlest details with clarity. Next, the phlegm, saliva, spittle, and sweat are eliminated, and black moles and scars vanish. Next, the *Embryonic Body* (胎全) is complete, the *qi* abundant, and one abstains from grains. Next, the inner will aligns with the *Great Void* (太虚), the seven emotions are exhausted, and the nine *chóng* (虫), three *shī* (尸) are annihilated. Next, the soul and spirit no longer wander, and dreams cease. Next, the *Yang Essence* (阳精) is perfected, and the *Divine Storehouse* (神府) is fortified—cold and heat cannot harm one. Next, one transcends life and death, sitting in *forgetfulness* (坐忘) and *Inner Contemplation*, wandering in the realm of *Huàxiū* (华胥). Next, the practice is complete, and one is granted the *Register of Merit* (授录); the Three *Qīng* (三清) can foresee the future. Next, the *Embryonic Immortal* (胎仙) appears. Next, the *Pure Yang* (纯阳) can dry the external *Mercury* (汞). Next, the *Embryonic Immortal* ascends, and auspicious light emerges. Next, stillness brings forth celestial music. Next, the body is filled with vitality, and the senses are keen—wealth and nobility are no longer distractions. Next, the *Divine Form* (仪观) transforms, and the *Divine Spirits* (神祇) are enslaved. Next, the external vision is filled with purple mist, and golden light surrounds one. Next, the *Fire Dragon* (火龙) ascends, the *Dark Crane* (玄鹤) rises, and the bones are purified. Finally, colorful clouds gather, and a *Jade Maiden* (玉女) descends, bestowing the *Purple Edict* (紫诏).*

*This is the fulfillment of the Dao.*

*Lüzi then, with heartfelt delight and sincere submission, advanced and said: "I now understand the profound principles!" But since I have not yet attained the practice, the methods of maintaining it will ultimately be in vain—no different from one who does not know. How then can I teach it?*

*Zhōnglí Master thus selected an auspicious day and imparted to him the *Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure* (灵宝毕法).*

*End of Volume 41 of the *Dao Gun* (道枢).*
*Beginning of Volume 42 of the *Dao Gun* (道枢).*

**Volume 42 of the *Dao Gun* (道枢) – *Lingbao Pian* (灵宝篇)**

Master Zhōnglí, having already transmitted the Dao to Lüzi, further declared:

*"I once ascended the Zhōngnán Mountains (终南) and obtained the Golden Edict (金诰), the Jade Records (玉录), and the essence of the True Source (真源)—these are the essentials of the Supreme Dao. Now, I shall expound them to you."*

Lüzi replied, *"I await your instruction."*

Master Zhōnglí then spoke:

*"The Heaven attains the Way of *Kàn* (乾), and accumulates *qi* to cover below;
The Earth attains the Way of *Kūn* (坤), bearing substance to support above.
Between them lies eighty-four thousand *lǐ* (里), yet *qi* and substance cannot intermingle.

Thus, Heaven draws upon *Kūn* with three *suǒ* (索) withdrawals—when complete, it returns to the Earth’s core, its *yang* bearing *yin* upward;
The Earth draws upon *Kàn* with three *suǒ* withdrawals—when complete, it returns to Heaven’s expanse, its *yin* embracing *yang* downward.
This ascent and descent in motion through the Dao is how Heaven and Earth endure eternally.

Between Heaven and Earth, what is closest to above is *yang*, descending forty-two thousand *lǐ*—this is the *yang* domain;
What is closest to below is *yin*, ascending forty-two thousand *lǐ*—this is the *yin* domain.

At the start of the year, on the Winter Solstice, *yang* rises from the Earth’s core.
Every fifteen days, it ascends seven thousand *lǐ*—three such phases mark one *jié* (节).
Forty-five days later, *yang* ascends twenty-one thousand *lǐ*—two *jié* complete one *shí* (时).
Ninety days later, *yang* ascends forty-two thousand *lǐ*, reaching the midpoint of Heaven and Earth, where *yang* merges with the *yin* domain.
At this juncture, *yin* is half within *yang*, and its *qi* shifts from cold to warmth—the division of Spring.
Beyond this, *yang* ascends into the *yang* domain, beginning to draw Earth’s *qi* upward—forty-five days later, this is the Establishment of Summer.
After another forty-five days, this is the Summer Solstice, where *yang*’s ascent completes eighty-four thousand *lǐ*, reaching Heaven.
Here, *yang* contains *yang*, and its *qi* shifts from warmth to heat.
As *yang* accumulates, *yin* emerges—one *yin* arises within two *yang*—this begins at the Summer Solstice.
Then, *yin* from Heaven’s core descends:
Fifteen days later, it descends seven thousand *lǐ*;
Forty-five days later, it descends twenty-one thousand *lǐ*;
Ninety days later, it descends forty-two thousand *lǐ*, reaching the midpoint, where *yin* merges with the *yang* domain.
Now, *yang* is half within *yin*, and its *qi* shifts from heat to chill—the division of Autumn.
Beyond this, *yin* descends into the *yin* domain, beginning to draw Heaven’s *qi* downward—forty-five days later, this is the Establishment of Winter.
After another forty-five days, this is the Winter Solstice, where *yin*’s descent completes eighty-four thousand *lǐ*, reaching Earth.
Here, *yin* contains *yin*, and its *qi* shifts from cool to cold.
As *yin* accumulates, *yang* emerges—one *yang* arises within two *yin*.
From the Winter Solstice onward, one *yang* again ascends, cycling eternally.
Thus, the Winter Solstice is when *yang* is born and ascends back to Heaven, while *yin* descends to Earth—this is the arrival of one *yang*.
The Summer Solstice is when *yin* is born and descends back to Earth, while *yang* ascends to Heaven—this is the arrival of one *yin*.

From the Summer Solstice, *yang* ascends upward, passing the Spring division and entering *yin*, departing the *yang* domain—these are the two *fèn* (分).
From the Winter Solstice, *yang* ascends downward—though *yin* descends, what descends is merely residual *yin* within *yang*, dissipating in the *yang* domain.
Though it descends and finds its place, when *yang* ascends, its *qi* is severed.

Similarly, from the Summer Solstice, *yin* descends upward—though *yang* ascends, what ascends is merely residual *yang* within *yin*, dissipating in the *yin* domain.
Though it ascends and finds its place, when *yin* descends, its *qi* is severed.

Thus, *yin* and *yang*—their ascent, descent, and motion—never exceed eighty-four thousand *lǐ*, yet the days number three hundred and sixty.
He who aligns with the four *qì* (气) of warmth, chill, cold, and heat has grasped *yin* and *yang*.
He who follows the eight *jié* of *yang*’s ascent and *yin*’s descent has comprehended Heaven and Earth.

Heaven and Earth are the greatest among all things;
Man is the most refined among all things—thus, man may align with Heaven and Earth.

The *heart* is Heaven;
The *kidneys* are Earth.
The *liver* is the *yang* domain;
The *lungs* are the *yin* domain.
The heart and kidneys are separated by eight *cùn* and four *fèn*—just as Heaven and Earth are divided in their covering and bearing.
*Qi* is *yang*;
*Liquid* is *yin*.

*Zǐ* (子) and *wǔ* (午) are the two solstices;
*Mǎo* (卯) and *yǒu* (酉) are the two divisions.
One day is one year.
I use the eight *guà* (卦) in a single day, thus attaining the eight *jié*’s measure.

At the hour of *Zǐ*, the kidneys’ *qi* is born;
At the hour of *Mǎo*, its *qi* reaches the liver.
The liver is *yang*, so its *qi* flourishes—thus *yang* ascends into the *yang* domain, mirroring the Spring Equinox.
At the hour of *Wǔ*, the *qi* reaches the heart, where accumulated *qi* generates *liquid*—this is the Summer Solstice, where *yang* ascends to Heaven and *yin* is born.
When the heart’s *liquid* is generated, by the hour of *Yǒu*, it reaches the lungs.
The lungs are *yin*, so its *liquid* flourishes—thus *yin* descends into the *yin* domain, mirroring the Autumn Equinox.
At the hour of *Zǐ*, the *liquid* reaches the kidneys, where accumulated *liquid* generates *qi*—this is the Winter Solstice, where *yin* descends to Earth and *yang* is born."*

The daily practice follows the cycle thus, its efficacy never failing, and can thus prolong life.

Heaven and Earth are one in the Dao/Way; he who attains its unity—is it not only humanity?

Yet after the embryo is complete and the *qi* is full, the Six Desires and Seven Emotions deplete the Primordial *Yang* and lose the True *Qi*. Even though there remains a natural interplay of *qi* and *liquid*, it cannot harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent.

I have often used methods to compel and forcibly reclaim them—only then can it be achieved.

With each exhalation, the Primordial *Qi* departs; with each inhalation, it returns. If it cannot be retained but instead follows the exhalation back out, then my Primordial *Qi* is in turn stolen by Heaven and Earth. Thus, when *Qi* scatters, it cannot generate *liquid*; when *liquid* is scarce, it cannot generate *Qi*.

At the time when *Qi* is flourishing, daily practice aligns with the *Zhèn* hexagram, focusing on *Qi*: retain more, exhale less, and forcibly hold it in the abdomen. At this moment, the ascent from below does not escape, and the descent from without is temporarily suspended.

When the two *Qi*s merge, accumulated *Qi* generates the Five *Zàng*’s *liquid*, and accumulated *liquid* returns to its source—thus the *Qi*’s generation and nourishment increase.

This is the attainment of the *Dà* (Great) *Mó* (Embryo) *Tāi* (Breath) *Xiǎo* (Small) *Chéng* (Completion).

The essence of the Dao/Way lies in seeking the *Yáng* *Gōng* (Lord) *Zhǎngzǐ* (Eldest Son) and attaining the True One—this is also the practice of retaining more and exhaling less.

What is the *Yáng* *Gōng* *Zhǎngzǐ*? It is the *Kàn* (Heavenly Stem) *Qián* (Trigram) interacting with *Kūn* (Earthly Stem), where the Primordial *Qi* ascends upward.

*Zhèn* is the Eldest Son. Thus, at the hour of *Mǎo*, the *Qi* is born from the kidneys, and the *liquid* descends from the heart, contending in ascent and descent. Therefore, when *Qi* is closed, the *liquid* is divided, and with both suspended beyond their proper time, the True One is attained.

The True One is True Water.

What is this Dao/Way? It is the interplay where accumulated *Qi* generates *liquid*, and accumulated *liquid* generates *Qi*—where *Qi* within *liquid* descends with the *liquid*, and *Qi* within *liquid* ascends with the *Qi*, a mutual generation of *Qi* and *liquid*.

Practice this for a year to see its effects; take a cycle of three hundred days as the term, and its benefits appear in ten days.

If one eats well and remains free of illness, the head is clear and the eyes bright, the heart is full while the abdomen is hollow—within, the sounds of wind and thunder resound. Is this not its effect?

If one sits still in quietude, ceasing all thought, and remains in *Dìng* (Stillness) throughout the day, emitting the *Yīn* *Shén* (Spirit), this is not the Dao/Way of the Immortal.

Lǚzǐ said: This is the *Yáng* *Tāi* (Embryo) and *Yīn* *Xī* (Breath) harmonizing with *Yīn* and *Yáng*—is this not so?

How does Water and Fire gather and disperse?

Zǐzhōnglízǐ said: Within the Great Dao/Way, Heaven and Earth are born; within Heaven and Earth, *Yīn* and *Yáng* are born.

Thus, Heaven and Earth have their high and low, and *Yīn* and *Yáng* have their beginning and end.

I observe their inclinations and count their measures—thus the Great Dao/Way can be known.

Therefore, by aligning with Heaven and Earth’s high and low, one knows the Dao/Way’s elevation and abasement; by aligning with *Yīn* and *Yáng*’s beginning and end, one knows the Dao/Way’s precedence and sequence.

Heaven and Earth do not depart from their measures, and their cycle is completed in one year; *Yīn* and *Yáng* do not lose their propriety, and their division is marked by the eight *jié*’s (solar nodes).

At the Winter Solstice, *Yīn* reaches its zenith, and the Primordial *Qi* generates one *Yáng*; by the Spring Equinox, *Yīn* contains half of *Yáng*—beyond this, it is pure *Yáng*.

At the Summer Solstice, *Yáng* reaches its zenith, and the Primordial *Qi* generates one *Yīn*; by the Autumn Equinox, *Yáng* contains half of *Yīn*—beyond this, it is pure *Yīn*.

To recognize the Great Dao/Way’s essence, one must follow Heaven and Earth’s laws and study *Yīn* and *Yáng*!

At the Winter Solstice, *Yáng* is born and ascends; by the time of *Lìchūn* (Beginning of Spring), it ascends into the *Yīn* domain—21,000 *lǐ* (miles), where *Yáng* cannot overcome *Yīn*.

At the Summer Solstice, *Yīn* is born and descends; by the time of *Lìdōng* (Beginning of Winter), *Yīn* descends below, its distance from Heaven being 63,000 *lǐ*, and from Earth being 21,000 *lǐ*—thus *Yīn* attains its domain, and *Yáng* nears exhaustion.

Hence, within a year, *Lìchūn* (Beginning of Spring) corresponds to the end of *Chǒu* (Ox) and the start of *Yín* (Tiger), the *Gèn* (Mountain) hexagram.

At this time, the kidneys’ *Qi* is born but has not yet reached the liver, dwelling within the *Yīn* domain.

This *Qi* is weak and struggles to ascend, residing within the *liquid*.

Within a year, *Lìdōng* (Beginning of Winter) corresponds to the end of *Xū* (Dog) and the start of *Hài* (Pig), the *Qián* (Heaven) hexagram.

At this time, the heart’s *liquid* descends inward, about to return to its source and reunite in the kidneys—a moment when *Yīn* is strong and *Yáng* is exhausted.

Here, *Qi* is scarce, and *liquid* is abundant. This is why people often suffer from illness and die young: *Yīn* and *Yáng* are disordered and do not ascend and descend, and *Qi* and *liquid* wither without mutual generation.

Alas! When *Qi* is exhausted and the *Shén* (Spirit) scatters, death ensues.

At *Lìchūn* (Beginning of Spring), *Yáng* ascends from below and can rise upward—thus within days, *Yīn* contains half of *Yáng*.

At *Lìdōng* (Beginning of Winter), *Yīn* descends from above and can sink downward—thus within days, *Yáng* contains half of *Yīn*.

Only humanity, at the time of *Gèn* (Mountain), has feeble *Qi* and does not know how to nourish it; at the time of *Qián* (Heaven), its *Qi* scatters and does not know how to gather it.

Moreover, with the Six Desires and Seven Emotions depleting the Primordial *Yáng*, the True *Qi* is not strengthened, and the True *liquid* is not generated—is this not lamentable?

At the time of *Gèn* (Mountain), I cultivate the Primordial *Qi*: stretching and contracting the hands and feet, so that the *Qi* of the Four Limbs is generated. Thus internally, it preserves the Primordial *Qi*, and upwardly, it nourishes the heart’s chambers. Then, swallowing the saliva once or twice, and massaging the face thirty or twenty times, prolonged practice yields luminous and supple skin.

This is the minor practice of *Sànhuǒ Liànxíng* (Dispersing Fire, Refining Form).

At the time of *Qián* (Heaven), I gather the Primordial *Qi*: sitting quietly, swallowing the *Qi*, and kneading the external kidneys.

What is swallowing the *Qi*? It is directing the heart’s fire downward.

What is kneading the external kidneys? It is collecting the *Pángguāng* (Bladder) *Qi* inward.

When the kidneys’ *Qi* is gathered, the three fires converge into one, supplementing the Lower Field.

When there is no fluid, *qi* gathers—thus fluid is generated;
When there is fluid, it is refined—thus *qi* is generated.
This is called the **Gathering Fire, Taiyi Embracing True *Qi***.

What is this *Dao*?
It is the *qi* of the heart that should be directed inward,
And the *qi* of the *Pángguāng* (Bladder) that should be gathered inward.
If it is not allowed to disperse but instead meets the *Kàn* (Water),
Then it is the center of the *Qi* Sea—the original *qi* of birth.

Autumn and winter are the beginning;
When its effects are seen, one must cease.
Practiced for one year, its efficacy is lost;
Take one day as equivalent to three hundred days—
In ten days, its effects will manifest:
The flesh and skin become plump and lustrous,
The Lower Field is harmonized and filled,
The spirit is clear and bright—
Is this not its effect?

**Lǚzǐ** asked: *"Is there a method to the union of the Dragon and Tiger?"*

**Zǐ Zhōnglí Zǐ** replied:
*"The *Dao* originates from the Primordial Division and has the Great Beginning (*Tàishǐ*);
The Great Beginning has the Great Non-being (*Tàiwú*);
The Great Non-being has the Great Emptiness (*Tàixū*);
The Great Emptiness has the Great Void (*Tàikōng*);
The Great Void has the Great Substance (*Tàizhì*).
The Great Substance is Heaven and Earth.
Its *qi* is clear and turbid,
Its form is like an egg,
Its hue is dark and yellow—
This is but one thing within the Great Void.

At the Winter Solstice, the earth’s *yang* ascends from below;
At the Summer Solstice, it reaches Heaven.
When *yang* is at its peak, *yin* arises.
The arising of *yin* is when *yang* emerges from within *yin*,
Rising from the earth—
Vague and indistinct,
With water within *qi* yet no form—
Thus, at the Summer Solstice, accumulated *qi* generates water.

At the Summer Solstice, Heaven’s *yin* descends;
At the Winter Solstice, it reaches the earth.
When *yin* is at its peak, *yang* arises.
The arising of *yang* is when *yin* emerges from within *yang*,
Issuing from Heaven—
Dark and obscure,
With *qi* within water yet no form—
Thus, at the Winter Solstice, accumulated water generates *qi*.

At the time of *Zǐ* (Water), the *Kàn* hexagram is active,
And the *qi* of the kidneys is born.
At the time of *Wǔ* (Fire), the *Lí* hexagram is active,
And the heart’s fluid is generated.

When the kidneys’ *qi* arises from *Kàn*,
It reaches the heart at *Lí*,
Meeting the heart’s *qi* and merging with the heart’s fire—
Thus, the Great Polarity generates fluid.
This is so because the *qi* from the kidneys carries true water within it, yet is formless—
Just as accumulated *yang* generates *yin*.

When the heart’s fluid arises from *Lí*,
It reaches the kidneys at *Kàn*,
Meeting the kidneys’ water and merging with it—
Thus, the Great Polarity reaches its peak and generates *qi*.
This is so because the fluid from the heart carries true *qi* within it, yet is formless—
Is this not akin to accumulated *yin* generating *yang*?

Thus, I know that the *yang* that is generated contains water within it,
And the *yin* that is generated contains *qi* within it—
I am in harmony with Heaven and Earth’s *yin* and *yang*.
Hence, the kidneys generate *qi*, within which lies true water—this is the **Tiger**;
The heart generates fluid, within which lies true *qi*—this is the **Dragon**.

Heaven is like an overturned basin—*yang* ascends within it;
Earth is like a flat stone—*yin* enters within it.
Yet humans cannot do this,
For they deplete their Primordial *Yang* and lose their True *Qi*.

The *Lí* hexagram—
In the body, it is the heart;
Externally, it is the time of *Wǔ*.
True *Yang*—
In the body, it is the Primordial *Yang*;
Externally, it is the Greater *Yang*.

Thus, at the time of *Lí*,
When the kidneys’ *qi* has reached the heart,
And the heart and kidneys interact,
One should enter a quiet space,
Alternate palms and knees,
Elevate the body and sit upright,
Stabilize the spirit within the inner chamber,
Make the nasal breath slow in inhalation and slow in exhalation—
Soft and lingering, as if suspended,
Filling the mouth with saliva without swallowing or spitting—
Naturally, the kidneys’ *qi* and the heart’s *qi* will merge,
And the Great Polarity will generate fluid.

Thus, when True Fluid and True Water merge,
True *Qi* clings to the fluid,
True Water clings to the *qi*.
*Qi* and fluid are not originally meant to merge—
Only because the fluid contains True *Qi*,
And the *qi* contains True Water,
Do they unite in exchange.
Thus, they descend in mutual attraction—
This is called the **Union of Dragon and Tiger**.

If the fire’s timing is precise
And one knows how to supplement the earth,
Then in three hundred days, the True Embryo will form,
And the Great Elixir will be complete—
This is the foundation of transcendence.

What is this *Dao*?
Primordial *Qi* is True Water—
It must not be dissipated or lost externally.
If *qi* scatters, it cannot generate fluid;
If fluid is scarce, there will be no True *Qi*;
If *qi* and water do not unite, the Great Elixir cannot form.
Thus, the True One’s water within the kidneys
And the heart’s rectified *yang* fluid—
When these two merge,
In the body, they generate the body;
In the spirit, they generate the spirit—
This is called **Internal Elixir**.

When the count reaches thirty cycles (of ten days),
One may achieve longevity.

In the year, the months are used—
Their beginning is at the Winter Solstice!
In the day, the times are used—
Their reference is the *Lí* hexagram!

If the Winter Solstice is the beginning,
In three hundred days, the Embryo of Immortality is complete.
Its form is like a pill,
Its color is vermilion and orange—
It eternally resides in the Lower Field and does not die.

If one studies the *Dao* in old age,
With roots and sources not yet firm,
Yet with ten years of loss,
One year of补 can restore it—
This is called **Harvesting and Returning the Elixir**.

This *Dao*—
If the补 is sufficient,
Sweet saliva will arise in the mouth,
The mind will naturally clear,
Emotions and desires will stilled,
The hundred limbs will rest in ease,
The eyes will gleam like lightning,
Spirit-light will manifest in darkness—
Is this not its effect?

**Lǚzǐ** asked: *"How are the fire’s phases of the Microcosmic Orbit?"*

**Zǐ Zhōnglí Zǐ** replied:
*"Cold, heat, warmth, and chill—
These are forms of *qi* within the body;
Clouds, mist, rain, and dew—
These are manifestations within *qi*.

When the earth’s *qi* ascends,
It rises as clouds and scatters as rain;
When Heaven’s *qi* descends,
It disperses as mist and condenses as dew.

If *yin* accumulates excessively,
Its dew becomes frost,
Its rain becomes snow;
If *yang* accumulates excessively,
Its mist becomes smoke,
Its clouds become mist-haze."

When *yin* harbors *yang* within,
*Yang* cannot ascend,
Thus it strikes and clashes, giving birth to thunder and lightning;

When *yang* harbors *yin* within,
*Yin* cannot disperse,
Thus it solidifies, producing hail and sleet.

Therefore, *yang*-light scatters as thunder,
*Yin*-*qi* surges as wind,
When *yin* and *yang* fail to unite,
Citron trees face each other and lightning manifests;
When *yin* and *yang* are unbalanced,
Chaotic mingling forms the rainbow’s arc.

Only the **True *Yang*** accumulates to become **Spirit**—
Its splendor in Heaven is the great Sun and Moon;
The **True *Yin*** accumulates to become **Form**—
Its grandeur on Earth is the precious metals and jade.

The Sun and Moon,
True *Yang* receiving True *Yin*,
Thus mutually completing;
The metals and jade,
True *Yin* receiving True *Yang*,
Thus mutually generating.

Hence, the **true *qi*** within my heart’s fluid
Is like the True *Yang*;
The **true water** within my kidney’s *qi*
Is like the True *Yin*.

Without True Water, True *Qi* cannot arise;
Without True *Qi*, True Water cannot form.
When these two separate,
They harmonize above the heart, below the lungs,
Like child and mother embracing,
Like husband and wife in love.

From **Li** to **Dui**—
**Dui** is the time when *yin* is strong and *yang* is weak,
Like the Moon’s waning phase,
Like metals and jade still in their rough state.

When the Sun and Moon retreat from brilliance to darkness,
Their cycles complete, and light is reborn;
When metals and jade emerge from *yin* to *yang*,
Their *qi* is full, and treasures manifest.
Thus, treasures arise when *qi* is full and *yang* is added;
Light manifests when their cycles complete and are received by the **Soul**,
Just as in my **Li** phase,
*Qi* accumulates to generate fluid,
And fluid returns to the **Lower Dan*tiel** (元).

If not added to with *qi*,
Then it is like the Moon’s waning phase failing to receive the **Soul**,
Like metals and jade in their rough state not emitting *yang*.
Therefore, at the **Qian** phase,
Advancing fire must be measured,
Refining *yang* without decline,
And increasing fire’s measure
Will make *yang* eternally thrive.

At the **Li** phase,
When the **Dragon** and **Tiger** unite,
This is the time of **elixir** collection.

Until **Qian**, when *qi* and fluid are about to return to the **Lower Dan*tiel**,
They arise in the **Bladder**’s upper region,
Below the **Spleen** and **Stomach**,
Before the **Kidney** and behind the **Navel**,
To the right of the **Small Intestine** and left of the **Large Intestine**.
At this time,
The **Spleen**’s *qi* is strong and the **Lungs**’s *qi* flourishes,
The **Kidney**’s *qi* is exhausted and the **Liver**’s *qi* is weak.

True *Qi* originally comes from the convergence of *qi*,
But now, with *yang* weak, True *Qi* has nothing to cling to,
And only at the **Li** phase is it collected and united.
Yet, when True *Qi* has nothing to cling to, it is about to disperse.

At the moment when True *Qi* is near exhaustion,
In the **Kun** phase’s foundation,
One must enter the **Quiet Chamber** and sit upright,
Stabilizing the **Spirit** within the **Mind**,
Refining the **Mind**’s inner realm,
Breathing softly through the nose,
And gently pressing the abdomen—
Thus, the **Navel** and **Kidney** grow hot or intensely so,
Then one must **release** lightly or **restrain** gradually;
If not yet hot, **restrain** and then **release** gradually;
When it is hot, **release** or **restrain** at will,
To fulfill the **Qian** phase,
Called **Restraint of the *Yang* Pass**.

Thus, refining the **Inner Elixir**,
One prevents True *Qi* from ascending to merge with True Water,
And the **Spleen**’s fluid is harmonized.
Following the breath,
One circulates and transports within the **Palace of Life** (黄庭),
Thus *qi* and fluid transform into **Essence**,
**Essence** into **Pearl**,
**Pearl** into **Mercury**,
**Mercury** into **Sand**,
**Sand** into **Gold**.
This is the completion of the **Inner Elixir**.

My saying—
*"Age and study the Dao, ten losses and one gain"*—
How can this be neglected now!

Collecting elixir at the **Li** phase,
Refining it at the **Qian** phase,
In spring and winter, collect much and refine little—
**Qian** once, **Li** twice, with doubled effort;
In autumn and summer, collect little and refine much—
**Li** once, **Qian** twice, with doubled effort.

After **one hundred days**, the elixir’s power is complete;
After **two hundred days**, the **Sacred Embryo** is firm;
After **three hundred days**, True *Qi* is full and the **Embryo of Immortality** is complete.

Once the elixir’s power is complete,
Then fire is advanced with increased measure—
This is the **fire’s phase**,
Thus the **Sacred Embryo** is firm,
And fire’s measure is increased
To reach the **Small Microcosmic Orbit**;

When the **Embryo** is complete and *qi* arises,
Then fire’s measure is increased
To reach the **Microcosmic Orbit**.

Yet, when at the **edge of exhaustion** and in seclusion,
The **Mind** dwells in inner observation,
Preventing inner disturbances from emerging,
And outer disturbances from entering,
Like the **Dragon** nurturing its **Pearl**.

Even between waking and sleep,
Between meals and speech,
Silent as an infant,
Moving like a maiden,
Still fearing loss or damage,
One must not for an instant depart from the Dao.

**Zǐ Zhōnglí Zǐ** said:
*"This is not the ultimate attainment—
It is merely a lesser success.
I possess methods for **Golden Essence**, **Jade Fluid**, and **Golden Fluid**."*

A year, spoken in months,
Is **six *Lǜ* and six *Lǘ***,
Counted from **six *Qi***—
The numbers complete the **six positions**,
**six times six** is **thirty-six days**,
The *yin*’s full cycle.

Spoken in days,
**five days** is one **phase**,
**seventy-two phases**,
The **eight *Jǐu*** and **nine *Yīn*** numbers—
Counted from **nine *Yīn***,
The numbers complete the **six positions**,
**six times nine** is **fifty-four days**,
The *yang*’s full cycle.

**One *Lǜ* and one *Lǘ*** together with **four *Qi*** make **fifteen**—
**Fifteen** is the *qi*’s cycle of **twenty-four**,
This is the **eight nodes**,
And thus one sees the principles of *yin* and *yang*’s ascent and descent.

**One *Lǜ* and one *Lǘ*** with **four *Qi*** as their use,
Thus *yang*’s numbers total **two hundred sixteen**,
*Yin*’s numbers total **one hundred forty-four**,
Altogether **three hundred sixty**,
This is the **Microcosmic Orbit**.

*Yin* and *yang*’s ascent and descent occur within Heaven and Earth,
Like my heart and kidney’s *qi* and fluid merging;
The Sun and Moon’s revolutions occur beyond Heaven and Earth,
This is my **elixir** circulating behind the elbow—**Flying Golden Essence**.

Thus, the **Lungs** and **Liver**’s *yin* and *yang*
Are like the Sun and Moon’s coming and going;
Advancing fire and refining losses
Are like the Sun and Moon’s union;
*Yin* and *yang*’s ascent and descent
Are like the Sun and Moon’s revolutions.

The **solstice** of the year,
The **sixteenth day** of the month,
In the human body,
Is like the time of **noon**.

「The **winter solstice** of the year,
The **first day** of the month,
In the human body,
Is like the time of **child**—**midnight**.

I observe that in Heaven and Earth’s *yin* and *yang*,
And the Sun and Moon’s *arcan soul* (魂) and *subtle spirit* (魄),
There is still the order of union and revolution,
Then my heart and kidney’s *qi* and fluid,
Liver and lungs’ *arcan soul* and *subtle spirit*,
Though daily functions have their rhythms,
Do they not lack the annual **refinement** and **consummation**?

At the **time of *Kan* (坎)**,
*Yang* is born in *Gen* (艮),
And the kidney’s *qi* unites at the liver’s front;
When they have not yet united,
I loosen my clothes and sit upright,
Focusing on my lower abdomen,
Swiftly raising my body,
Then thrusting forward from my chest,
Slightly reclining my head backward,
Closing the **double gates** (双关) behind my spine,
With my elbows gently fanning front and back once or twice,
Then straightening my waist,
From the **tail vein** (尾闻), its heat like fire,
Rising from beneath my waist to gather at the **double gates** below my spine,
The double gates must not open,
As the heat intensifies and the *qi* grows strong, gradually opening the double gates,
Allowing the *qi* to pass through,
Then reclining my face upward, tightly pressing my head backward,
To close the **upper gate** (上关),
When the heat is extreme and the *qi* is powerful,
Gradually guiding it into the **forehead** (顶),
To nourish the **muddy pellet** (泥丸).

This is the foundation of **longevity**!
Then, employing the **elixir of return** (还丹) method,
I thrust from the chest and straighten the waist to close the double gates,
Focusing on and raising it,
If fire does not arise from the waist,
I sit quietly and observe internally,
Using the method again to ignite the fire.

From **chou (丑)** onward,
Until **yin (寅)** ends,
Its name is **Flying Golden Essence** (飞金晶).
Indeed, it is to make the liver’s *qi* arise from the kidney’s *qi*.

The **spine’s vertebrae** (夹脊之骨),
Number **twenty-four**,
From the lower three vertebrae,
Facing the kidney internally,
This is called the **Heavenly Pillar** (天柱).
Above the Heavenly Pillar,
This is the **Jade Capital** (玉京).
Below the Jade Capital,
Facing the kidney internally,
The **tail vein** (尾闻) above, **eighteen** vertebrae,
Among them is the **double gates** (双关),
Upper nine, lower nine,
In **one hundred days**, one can pass through and enter the muddy pellet.

The essentials of its practice:
Beginning at *Gen* (艮),
And flying the Golden Essence to *Xun* (巽) to complete,
This is the **hexagram *Li* (离)**, the **alchemical refining** method;
The **hexagram *Qian* (乾)**, the **advancing fire and restraining the *Yang* gates** method.

Beginning at the winter solstice,
Practicing for one hundred days,
And the Golden Essence enters the brain,
The **three gates and one impact** (三关一撞),
Directly entering the **upper palace** (上宫) muddy pellet.
Beginning at *Gen* (艮),
Ending at *Zhen* (震),
The alchemical refining is done in *Li* (离).

With no further union of kidney’s *qi*,
Only the liver’s *qi* generates the heart’s *qi*,
All being **pure *yang*** (纯阳).
Then the **two *bā* (八) of *yin*** (二八之阴) is consumed,
Its *qi* perfumes the **lungs** (肺),
And attains the size of **millet grains** (黍米之大),
Entering the **Yellow Court** (黄庭),
This is the **material for the inner elixir** (内丹之材)!
One hundred days without deviation,
The elixir’s power is complete.

Thus, alchemical refining in *Li* (离),
Employing methods according to the season,
Internal observation is refined further in *Qian* (乾),
Advancing fire to restrain the *Yang* gates.

Beginning at *Dui* (兑),
Ending at *Qian* (乾),
In one hundred days, the Golden Essence flies.

Beginning at *Gen* (艮) and sitting,
Ending at *Xun* (巽),
The *Li* (离) alchemical refining method remains unchanged,
Three hundred days without deviation,
The **holy embryo** (圣胎) is firm.

Restraining the *Yang* gates:
Beginning at *Kun* (坤) and sitting,
Ending at *Qian* (乾),
In one hundred days, the muddy pellet is filled,
And **rejuvenation** (还童) is achieved.

This method encompasses the **reversal of the five phases** (五行颠倒),
And the **reciprocating cycles of the three fields** (三田反覆).

First, harmonizing *yin* and *yang*,
To make the *qi* **nurture and generate**;
Next, gathering and dispersing **water and fire** (水火),
To solidify the **roots and sources** (根源),
And make the *qi* flow while **nurturing ceases**;
Then, uniting **Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎),
To refine and supplement the elixir of return,
Which is what I call **minor accomplishment** (小成).

In the middle of the year, selecting a month,
The month of the winter solstice, choosing the day at **shen (申)**,
The day of **jiazi (甲子)**, choosing the time at **midnight** (子),
*Gen* (艮), *Li* (离), and *Qian* (乾) mark its beginning.

From *Gen* (艮) to *Xun* (巽),
From *Qian* (乾) to *Kun* (坤),
Three hundred days’ practice is sufficient,
This is **medium accomplishment** (中成).

To practice this **Dao/Way** (斯道),
One must be in a **pure and tranquil place** (清静之区),
Eyes not seeing what is desirable,
Ears not hearing clamor,
Nose not inhaling foul odors,
Mouth not indulging in the **five flavors** (五味),
The **six desires and seven emotions** (六欲七情) undisturbed in the heart,
Dreading lest one lose it,
Awake or asleep, one must be **vigilant and cautious** (惴惴焉).
If the practice is not diligent,
One will not attain **immortality** (仙),
Only **delayed death** (赊死) will be the result.

What is this Dao/Way?
It is the **three primal cycles** (三元) in operation.»

「The **Flying Gold Crystal** (飞金晶) practitioner returns from the **Lower Field** (下田) to the **Upper Field** (上田)! The **Herb Gatherer** (采药者) returns from the **Lower Field** (下田) to the **Middle Field** (中田)! The **Concentrator at the Yang Pass** (勒阳关进火) returns from the **Middle Field** (中田) to the **Lower Field** (下田).

At the outset of its effects,
One experiences frequent palpitations while asleep,
Slight ailments in the **four limbs and six palaces** (四支六府),
Which heal without medicine.

With eyes closed and entering obscurity,
A luminous glow appears,
Like a **golden lock and jade key** (金关玉钥),
Their seal intact and firm,
To prevent the leakage of **Jade Essence** (精),
A single thunderous beat,
And the **joints and channels** (关节气) harmonize,
With **spiritual radiance** (神彩) clear and the **Elixir Field** (丹田) in accord,
The mind’s disturbances naturally dissipate.

In sleep,
One feels as though embracing an infant to return,
Or soaring in flight to wander,
Thus the **Eight Evils** (八邪) cannot interfere.

After **three hundred days** (三#2百日), the **Embryonic Immortal** (胎仙) is complete,
And the **Jade Nectar** (玉液) can refine the body—
This practice may then be undertaken.

When **Yang ascends** (阳之升),
How does it generate **Yin** (阴) from the **Supreme Ultimate** (太极)?
If **Yin is insufficient** (阴不足) yet **Yang has excess** (肠有余),
Then **accumulated Yang** (积阳) produces **spiritual essence** (神).
When **Yin descends** (阴之降),
How does it generate **Yang** (阳) from the **Supreme Ultimate** (太极)?
If **Yang is insufficient** (阳不足) yet **Yin has excess** (阴有余),
Then **accumulated Yin** (积阴) produces **form** (形).

**Spirit** (神) is what I call the **Sun and Moon** (日月);
**Form** (形) is what I call **Gold and Jade** (金玉).
The essence of **Gold and Jade** (金玉之质),
Arises from **accumulated Yin** (积阴),
While internally storing **true Yang Qi** (真阳之气),
Further nurtured by the **Sun and Moon** (日月),
Causing **true Yin and true Yang** (真阴真阳) to descend and form this precious treasure,
Which should indeed be cherished!

Those who accumulate **Yin to form** (积阴成形) and then embrace **Yang** (抱阳),
Are like our own accumulation of **herbs into true Embryonic Immortal Qi** (真胞真气),
To cultivate the **Embryonic Immortal** (胎仙).

Their **Qi** (气) surges toward the heavens,
Rising with **Yang** (阳) and ascending,
Descending into the earth,
Falling with **Yin** (阴) and returning,
As it follows **Yin and Yang** (阴阳) in their ascent and descent,
There are naturally the **four seasons** (东西四时) to distinguish.

This is like our **returning the Gold Nectar** (金掖) to the **Elixir Field** (丹田),
And using **Jade Nectar** (玉液) to refine the **form and essence** (形质),
Adjusting with the **four seasons** (四时) in their waxing and waning,
And daily shifting in **one cycle** (一日改移).

After **three hundred days** (三百日),
When the **true Qi** (真气) is complete,
One can then **return the Elixir and refine the form** (还丹炼形).

Thus, the **Gen** (艮) hexagram is employed,
To **Fly the Gold Crystal** (飞金晶) until it reaches **Xun** (巽) and stops.
The **Li** (离) **Herb Gathering** (采药),
And the **Kun** (坤) **Yang Pass** (阳关),
All cease at this point and are not practiced further.

Only the **Dui** (兑) hexagram is used,
To **Concentrate at the Yang Pass** (勒阳关),
Until it reaches **Qian** (乾) and stops.

Since one does not practice **Li’s Herb Gathering** (离之采药),
But instead **returns the Elixir** (还丹),
This is the **Swallowing Method** (咽法).
Its technique involves
Stirring the **upper and lower teeth** (上下愕) with the tongue between the **two cheeks** (二颊之间),
First swallowing the **impure saliva** (恶浊之津),
Then retracting the tongue’s tip to separate from the **Jade Pool** (玉池).
When the **saliva is generated** (津生),
One should not rinse but swallow it directly.

In the **Spring months** (春之月),
When the **Liver’s Qi** (肝之气) is strong,
And the **Spleen’s Qi** (脾之气) is weak,
One should daily employ the **Li** (离) hexagram.

In the **Summer months** (夏之月),
When the **Heart’s Qi** (心之气) is strong,
And the **Lung’s Qi** (肺之气) is weak,
One should daily employ the **Xun** (巽) hexagram.

In the **Autumn months** (秋之月),
When the **Lung’s Qi** (肺之气) is strong,
And the **Liver’s Qi** (肝之气) is weak,
One should daily employ the **Gen** (艮) hexagram,
To **Fly the Gold Crystal** (飞金晶);
The **Swallowing Method** (咽) may also be used.

In the **Winter months** (冬之月),
When the **Kidney’s Qi** (肾之气) is strong,
And the **Heart’s Qi** (心之气) is weak,
One should daily employ the **Zhen** (震) hexagram.

In the **transition seasons** (四时之季),
When the **Spleen’s Qi** (脾之气) is strong,
And the **Kidney’s Qi** (肾之气) is weak,
After the **eight days of the decan** (旬有八日),
One should employ the **Dui** (兑) hexagram.
For **Spring’s Li** (春之离), **Summer’s Xun** (夏之巽), and **Winter’s Zhen** (冬之震),
They should be practiced concurrently during their respective times.
Only in **Autumn** (秋) does one exclusively employ **Dui** (兑).

What is this Dao/Way?
It is the understanding of the **roots and branches of the Five Phases** (五行之根蒂),
And how they generate and restrain one another!」

The method of **Swallowing** (咽) is thus: if no saliva (津) arises between the teeth and the **Jade Pool** (玉池), what then?

Daily, I stir the **upper and lower teeth** (上下齿) with my tongue, then draw in the **Jade Pool’s double collection** (玉池双收) to the two cheeks, and **swallow the qi** (虚咽气). Within the qi, water emerges.

The number of swallows begins at **thirty-six**, then **forty-nine**, then **eighty-one**, then **one hundred eighty-one**—awaiting efficacy as the measure.

This is called the **Jade Nectar** (玉液). Practiced for a year, it irrigates the **Elixir Field** (丹田), bathes the **Embryonic Immortal** (胎仙), and the **True Qi** (真气) thrives abundantly.

If this is not done, within **three hundred days** the **Inner Elixir** (内丹) will already be formed, and the **True Qi** will arise on its own. Then, one employs **Gen** (艮) to **Fly the Golden Essence** (飞金晶), striking the **three passes** (三关) and entering the **Mud Pillow** (泥丸) directly.

When the qi first arises, why does one **plug the ears** (塞耳) with the hands? Because the ears are the **Kidney’s Gate** (肾之门)—fearing the **Kidney’s Qi** (肾之气) will leak outward.

When practicing this method, from the **forehead’s center**, **Golden Water** (金水) descends forward like a **rising anvil** (建锟), pouring into the **Yellow Court** (黄庭), transforming into **Golden Elixir** (金丹).

Thus, the method of **Golden Nectar** (金液) must be practiced in a **quiet chamber** (静宇), with **palms pressed together** (迭掌) and **legs crossed** (蟠膝), sitting upright, severing thought, forgetting emotion, and **inner observation** (内观). When the **Golden Essence** (金晶) of **Gen** (艮) flies into the **crown**, slightly raise the head, letting the **flame behind the brain** (脑之后) blaze like fire. Then, **tilt the head back** (频府仰首), lower the head toward the **throat**, retract the tongue toward the back, and **prop the upper palate** (拄上愕).

Thus, the **Upper Clarity’s Sacred Mushroom Water** (上清灵芝之水), sweet in taste, fragrant in qi, is either **gargled** (漱) or **swallowed** (咽), descending back to the **Yellow Court**. This is called the **Golden Nectar**.

Throughout the year, it is practiced without pause. Only when the **Golden Essence flies**, one swallow per flight, until **Zhen** (震) is reached, and once it has entered the **brain**, follow the **nodes in sequence**: begin with **Gen**, end with **Xun** (巽).

As the day wanes and the **Yang Pass** (阳关) is **locked**, begin with **Dui** (兑) and end with **Qian** (乾).

In practicing this, one must **sever distractions** (绝边) and **cleanse the heart** (清心) to achieve success.

This Dao/Way requires the **Golden Essence to fly**, the **medicine to be gathered**, the **Yang Pass to be locked**, and the **Inner Elixir to be complete**—only then, after **three hundred days**, may one proceed.

Otherwise, if one merely **refines the Elixir** (还丹) to **purify the Flower Pool** (华池), the **Great Medicine** will scatter and yield no benefit.

Its effects: the **body glows**, the **spirit is refined**, the **pupils darken**, the **hair turns black**, the **complexion remains youthful**, the **qi is internally sufficient** and does not falter, the **bones are transformed**, the **spirit chamber** (神室) is renewed, one’s **stride surpasses galloping steeds**, the **saliva congeals like butter**, and **cold and heat cannot harm**.

If one guards against the **Yang’s Supreme Ultimate** (阳之太极), then with **Jade Nectar** to irrigate and bathe, the **Inner Elixir is moistened**.

After **three hundred days**, practicing the **Golden Nectar** is the method of **Completed Crossing** (既济). **Ignite fire to welcome True Water** (起火以迎真水), **upper water and lower fire**, rising and sinking alternately, **refining Yin with Yang**, aiming to transform into **Pure Yang** (纯阳). When the work is complete, one may **soar beyond the world’s bounds**.

Its efficacy: **a hundred days** show results, **a year** brings completion.

What is meant by **Golden-Jade Nectar** (金玉之液)?

**Accumulated Yang becomes Spirit** (积阳成神), within which there is form—**one born of the Sun**, **two born of the Moon**.

**Accumulated Yin becomes Form** (积阴成形), within which there is Spirit—**one born of Metal**, **two born of Jade**.

The **Sun travels nine**, the **Moon six**, rising and setting with **Yin and Yang**; **Gold and Jade** also follow **Yin and Yang**. They **ascend in Spring and Summer**, **descend in Autumn and Winter**.

The **Kidney’s Qi** is the **Moon**; its **obscure nectar** (冥液) is **Gold**. The **Heart’s Qi** is the **Sun**; its **nectar** is **Jade**.

**Jade Nectar** originates from the **Kidney’s Qi**, ascending to the **Heart** to merge with the **Heart’s Qi**. When the two qi intersect and pass through the **Double Tower** (重楼), sealing the mouth and not exhaling, saliva fills the **Jade Pool**, and swallowing it yields **Jade Nectar**.

With my tongue, I stir the **upper and lower palate** (上下之愕), close the **Jade Pool**, and draw in the two cheeks, swallowing the qi in emptiness.

This is the method of **Returning Elixir** (还丹). Within the qi lies **True Water**; when qi gathers, water gathers—**the Mother moves, the Child follows**.

Since **Jade Nectar** is already the **Returning Elixir**, how does it refine the **Form** (炼形)? The **nectar** arises from the **Kidney**, generated in the **Heart**, just as **earth produces stone**, and **stone produces jade**.

**Golden Nectar** is the **Kidney’s Qi** and **Heart’s Qi** merging and ascending, **blackening** (蒸) in the **Lungs**. The **Lungs** are the **Canopy** (华盖), enveloping the two qi below, then drawing their nectar by day.

This nectar lies in the **Lower Field** (下田), ascending from the **tail** (尾闲), known as **Flying the Golden Essence** to **supplement the Mud Pillow**.

Once the **Mud Pillow** is sufficiently supplemented, it descends from above back to the **Lower Elixir Field**, becoming **Golden Nectar Returning Elixir**.

When it returns to the **Lower Field** and ascends again, circulating through the **four limbs**, this is **Golden Nectar refining the Form**—also like **Gold arising from Earth**.

How can the **Golden Essence’s flight** traverse the **three passes** and enter the **Nine Heavens** (九天)?

The **tail** is the **lower pass** (下关);
The **spine’s junction** (夹脊) is the **middle pass** (中关);
The **brain’s rear** (脑后) is the **upper pass** (上关).
The **crown** is the **Third Heaven** (九天#3).

After the **Jade Nectar returns to the Elixir**, dwelling in a **secluded quiet chamber**, untouched by wind, unexposed to sun, **secretly invoking the Three Pure Ones**:

*"To practice the Dao and manifest transformation, first refine the Form beyond Yin and Yang. Then, burning incense and swallowing, at the time of **Zhen** (震), close the eyes, still the heart, sit upright, and let the **nasal breath** be **soft and slow in inhalation, sparse and delayed in exhalation**. Deepen **inner observation**, letting no outer scene enter, no inner thought exit. Fill the mouth with saliva, neither spitting nor swallowing. Let the qi fill the four limbs, governing it carefully, lest it scatter or falter from weariness. Gradually cease and rise again, until the time of **Li** (离), when the qi has merged. Then, the qi becomes ineffable and beautiful."*

This is the practice of **refining the Form with Jade Elixir**—a means only to preserve the Form and dwell in the world. If one can abandon all external affairs and set their mind on the **Daoist Immortal**, they should, after the **Elbow-Posture Flying Gold Crystal** and **Kidney Complementation**, follow the previous method: let the **Jade Elixir return to the Dan Field** from the crown down to the kidneys. Begin with **Zhen** (震) and proceed until **Li** (离), when it ceases.

The methods of **Jade Elixir** and **Gold Elixir** are alike, yet their distinctions lie in **inner observation**. This is not merely so! When **returning the Elixir** and **refining the Form**, they are practiced in parallel—how could Jade Elixir compare?

The essence lies in **pure Yang and exhausted Yin**. In spring and winter, one should **swallow twice per rise**—how can this be called a rise? It is the **upright posture** mentioned earlier. In autumn and winter, one should **swallow five times per rise**. When swallowing in autumn and summer, the number is fifty; in spring and winter, over a hundred. This is done to **strengthen the Yang Pass** (#4) diligently, until the **completion of Qian** (乾), following the same method as before.

As for **refining the Form with Gold Elixir**, after **recovery** (#5), one **uprightly raises** and then **reclines forward**, flying the **Gold Crystal**. **Reclining forward** is the **returning of the Gold Elixir**. When the **Gold Crystal passes the crown**, it descends to the **Dan Field**, meeting the **refined Form’s qi**—do not swallow hastily! Wait until the **qi fills the four limbs**, the **mind relaxes**, and the **spirit flows freely**, until **saliva dries** and the **heart is cleansed**. Then, **swallow gently**, opposing the **qi’s movement**—this is the **achieved completion** (既济). Practicing this from **Gen** (艮) to **Li** (离), raising and swallowing, is also acceptable.

Then, how does **refining the Form** truly work? The **Gold Crystal ascends**, igniting the **inner fire** and entering the **crown**. **Raising uprightly** and **lifting forward**, its name is **consuming the Form**. Within the **fire**, one again **returns the Elixir**, adjusting the **four seasons’ intensity**. Only then can one be bound by the **years and months**!

Within my daily cycle, there are **Qian and Kun** (乾坤). Before noon, I **consumingly ignite** in **Qian**; after noon, I **consumingly ignite** in **Kun**. Speaking of the human body, the **front** is **Kun**, the **back** is **Qian**—this is the **Elbow-Posture Flying Gold Crystal**.

When **consuming in Kun**, one begins with **Dui** (兑), **restraining the Yang Pass**, and ceases at **Qian**. This must not be neglected for even a moment. In winter and spring, practice the **achieved completion** method for **three to five days**, to **prevent the swallowing of the Elixir** when the **inner fire** is ignited. Thus, the **Gold Elixir** will not be refined.

My **consuming the Form** does not merely refine the Form into **qi**—it suffices to **expel the Yin spirits** and **nourish the spirit**, killing the **Nine Vermin** and **Three Pests** below.

Now, can one discuss the **method of refining qi into spirit to attain the Primordial Origin**? What are the effects of refining the Form?

It is said: **The mind is pure and lofty**, harmonizing with the **Primordial Void** (太虚). The **soul and spirit** do not wander, and **dreams vanish**. Once the **Yang essence** is formed, the **spirit treasury** is secured. **Fire cannot scorch**, **water cannot moisten**, and the **true qi** emerges from the **spirit gate** (神门) in black.

Thus, the **eyebrows bear white hairs**—its **qi is purely Yang**, capable of **drying mercury**. Breathing can **cure illness**, and **calamities and blessings** can be foreknown. Is this not its effect? Though inferior to the **Primordial Origin’s** marvel!

The **one, three, five, seven, nine** are the **Dao’s divisions** into numbers. The **Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth** are the **Dao’s transformations** into symbols. Without division, there is no number; without number, the **Dao’s origin**. Without transformation, there is no symbol; without symbol, the **Dao’s root**.

I know the **symbols of Heaven and Earth** to be their **qi and Water**. I know the **numbers of Heaven and Earth** to be their **distant and near**. Yet, is the **Dao** truly distant?

Heaven and Earth have **Five Emperors**, just as my **Five Viscera** do. The **Green Emperor’s virtue** is **Wood**, his **stem-branches** (干支) **Jia and Yi**—**Jia** is Yang, **Yi** is Yin, just as the **qi and fluids** of my **liver**. The **Red Emperor’s virtue** is **Fire**, his **stem-branches** **Bing and Ding**—**Bing** is Yang, **Ding** is Yin, just as the **qi and fluids** of my **heart**. The **White Emperor’s virtue** is **Metal**, his **stem-branches** **Geng and Xin**—**Geng** is Yang, **Xin** is Yin, just as the **qi and fluids** of my **lungs**. The **Black Emperor’s virtue** is **Water**, his **stem-branches** **Ren and Gui**—**Ren** is Yang, **Gui** is Yin, just as the **qi and fluids** of my **kidneys**. The **Yellow Emperor’s virtue** is **Earth**, his **stem-branches** **Wu and Ji**—**Wu** is Yang, **Ji** is Yin, just as the **qi and fluids** of my **spleen**.

In spring months, the **liver’s qi** is abundant—**the true qi of the parents** follows the **Heaven’s seasonal movement**, residing in the **liver**. On **Wood days** (甲乙), **save Earth** during **Chen, Xu, Chou, Wei** hours, and **ignite the fire** to refine the **spleen’s qi**. On other days, **restrain Metal** at **Dui** hours, **exhausting the lung’s qi**. At this time, **do not exert effort**.

During **Kan** (坎) hours, **ignite the fire** to refine the **kidney’s qi**. At **Zhen** (震) hours, **enter the chamber**, inhaling deeply and exhaling sparsely—**cessation of breath** is supreme, **prolonged closure** is secondary—using **a thousand breaths** as the measure. **Inner observation** focuses entirely on the **liver**; **still the mind**, close the eyes, and the **green hue** will appear. **Gradually raise the Form**, entering the **Muddy Pellet** (泥丸), from **Yin** to **Chen**, completing at **Zhen**. The **nasal breath’s exhalation** becomes **habitually faint**—then the breath ceases. Do not **force hasty completion**.

In summer months, the **heart’s qi** is abundant—**the true qi of the parents** follows the **Heaven’s seasonal movement**, residing in the **heart**. On **Fire days** (丙丁), **save Metal** during **Dui** hours, and **ignite the fire** to refine the **lung’s qi**. On other days, **restrain Water** at **Kan** hours, **exhausting the kidney’s qi**. At this time, **do not exert effort**.

During **Zhen** (震) hours, **ignite the fire** to refine the **liver’s qi**. At **Li** (离) hours, **enter the chamber**, **halt the breath**, and **steady the breath** as before. The **red qi** appears. **Gradually raise the Form**, entering the **Muddy Pellet**, from **Si** to **Wei**, completing at **Li**.

In autumn months, the **lung’s qi** is abundant—**the true qi of the parents** follows the **Heaven’s seasonal movement**, residing in the **liver**.

If it is **Metal’s day** (庚辛), **save Wood** during **Zhen** (震) hours, and **ignite the fire** to refine the **liver’s qi**. On other days, **restrain Fire** at **Li** (离) hours, **exhausting the heart’s qi**; at this time, **do not exert effort**.

During **Xun** (巽) hours, **ignite the fire** to refine the **spleen’s qi**. At **Dui** (兑) hours, **enter the chamber**, **halt the breath**, and **steady the breath** as before. **White qi** appears. **Gradually raise the Form**, entering the **Muddy Pellet**, from **Shen** (申) to **Xu** (戌), completing at **Dui**.

In winter months, the **kidney’s qi** is abundant—**the true qi of the parents** follows the **Heaven’s seasonal movement**, residing in the **kidney**.

If it is **Water’s day** (壬癸), **save Fire** during **Li** (离) hours, and **ignite the fire** to refine the **heart’s qi**#6. On other days, **restrain Earth** at **Chen** (辰), **Xu** (戌), **Chou** (丑), or **Wei** (未) hours, **exhausting the spleen’s qi**; at this time, **do not exert effort**.

During **Dui** (兑) hours, **ignite the fire** to refine the **lung’s qi**. At **Kan** (坎) hours, **enter the chamber**, **halt the breath**, and **steady the breath** as before. **Black qi** appears. **Gradually raise the Form**, entering the **Muddy Pellet**, from **Hai** (亥) to **Chou** (丑), completing at **Kan**.

In spring, **refine the liver with a thousand breaths**#7; **blue-green qi** emerges. Within its **final decan**#1, there are **eight days** dedicated solely to **steadying the breath**, sitting silently throughout the day to nurture the **unconcentrated spirit** and refine the **true qi**.

During **Kan** (坎) hours, **ignite the fire** to refine the **kidney’s qi**, lest it exhaust the **true qi**.

In summer, **refine the heart with a thousand breaths**; **red qi** emerges.
In autumn, **refine the lungs with a thousand breaths**; **white qi** emerges.
In winter, **refine the kidneys with a thousand breaths**; **black qi** emerges.

Each season, within its **final decan**, there are **eight days** dedicated solely to **steadying the breath**, and thereafter, **igniting the fire** and refining the **qi** follows the initial method.

Thus, **yellow qi** forms as radiance, suffusing the body brilliantly.

Now, **steadying the breath**—is it not about **forcibly retaining** and **rigidly sealing**? Rather, it should be **gentle and enduring**, like something always present, yet **not overused**. **Entering from having to non-being**, letting it **self-arrest**, is the way.

Why **gathering medicinal herbs**? To **retain the saliva** and **grasp the firmness**, pressing down the **heart’s true qi** so it does not scatter.

Why **entering the chamber**? To dwell in **seclusion and silence**, where **clamor is unheard**. Open a small inner aperture, barely discernible to the eye, when the **yang spirit** first gathers and the **true qi** congeals—like an infant yet to take its first breath. **The ears must hear nothing**; if they hear, the **spirit and qi** will tremble and dissipate.

As for **rancid, frenetic, foul, and putrid qi**, or **lustful and seductive hues**, they not only **disturb the true qi**, but are also **abhorrent to the spirit**.

Thus, **three reverential salutations** are made:
1. **Earthly Immortal**#2, whose **practice is half-complete**,
2. **Celestial Immortal**#3, who **transmits the Dao** and **transforms**,
3. **Spiritual Immortal**#4, who **eliminates great calamities**, **establishes great virtue**, and **retires to the borders**#5.

Afterward, **sit in stillness**, forgetting the **mechanisms**#6, and **diligently practice**.

This method must be **gradually observed**, its effects **sequentially verified**, before advancing.

If one **directly pursues** the **Dao of the Morning Primordium**#7 without progression, one may yet **emerge as a ghostly immortal**#8.

The **Dao of the Morning Primordium**—is it so easily spoken of?

**A thousand days** to cultivate **one qi**, **one to overcome ten**—**a hundred days** to attain **effect**, **five hundred days** to **fulfill the qi**.

From then on, one may **practice inner observation**.

**Concentrate the yang spirit** to **enter the Celestial Palaces**#9, **refine it** to **align with the Great Dao**—what marvelous effects shall ensue?

The **body seems to float**, **elixir light permeates the bones**, and **purple mist fills the vision**.

**One qi returns to the heart**, impervious to **external influences**.
**One heart moves one qi**, unconstrained by **methods**#10.

The **heart’s source** is **pure and transparent**, **illuminating all obstructions**—thus, **no perception of external things**.
**Qi is resolute and mighty**, **ten thousand sensations** are **subdued by one breath**—thus, **no perception of methods**.

**Things without things**, returning to the **original form**!
**Methods without methods**, attaining the **self-realized truth**!

When my **refinement and cultivation** are complete, **the harmonious qi of the parents** congeals yet does not disperse. **Absolute emptiness and true nature** are **serene and effortless**, the **spirit merging with the Dao**, returning to **spontaneity**—thus, **using non-mind as mind**, unaware of one’s own body—**entering the realm of the Rare and Exalted**#11.

This method—is it **like visualizing**? Is it **like meditation**?

I select a **blessed site** as my **quiet dwelling**, sit upright with **legs folded**, **loosen my hair** and **wear simple robes**, **grasp firmness** and **retain the spirit**, **darken the mind** and **close the eyes**, **slightly elevate the body** forward, and **ignite the fire** to refine the **qi**.

After **noon**, I **slightly bend the body** forward, **concentrate the fire** to refine the **elixir**, **permeating day and night**. The **spirit and qi** are **clear and harmonious**, and I sit without **relenting** in this state.

**Do not listen** to sounds, **do not gaze** at sights—thus, **self-preservation** is ensured.

If **demons** press and harass, **quickly bend the body slightly forward**, then **straighten the back**, afterward **lean the chest slightly forward**, yet **do not straighten the back**.

Soon, **fire rises high** both **front and back**, yet **the body remains unmoved**—this is called **the fire of the body**.

When the **fire is ignited**, the **demons flee**, and **yin evils** do not enter.

Thus, **twice**, **thrice**, until **suddenly seeking transcendence**, or **yin spirits** do not disperse, **emerging as ghostly deities**, their **forms unseen**, ultimately **nowhere to rest**—**they seize a womb** to **steal another’s body** and **then become human**#12, or **they enter and exit without mastery**, **wandering aimlessly without method**, **once gone, never returning**, **losing their original form**, their **spirit and soul** **unknown in their whereabouts**—thus, the **monks’ seated dissolution** and the **Daoists’ corpse dissolution**#13.

Therefore, it is said:
**If one emerges yet re-enters**, and **re-enters yet does not emerge**, then **form and spirit are both wondrous**, **aligned with Heaven and Earth**;
**If one emerges yet does not re-enter**, and **re-enters yet emerges again**, then **the spirit ascends to the sacred**, **soaring over the Three Islands and Ten Continents**#14.

The **Forty-Second Scroll of the Dao Pivot**#15 ends here.
