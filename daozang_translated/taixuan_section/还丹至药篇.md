**Preface to *The Supreme Medicine of the Returned Elixir***

In my youth, I dwelt within the military camp, my heart set upon obscure passions. By chance, I met a like-minded companion who revealed to me the red furnace. For twenty years, I pursued cultivation in vain—my worldly heart unchanged, my secular desires ever-present. I sought only the gates of profit and self-preservation, never delving into the essence of the golden elixir. Adrift and aimless, I achieved nothing, my steps faltering, my path lost. Only later did I come to trust that the eight minerals held no power to ascend to sagehood, just as the five metals remained but common substances.

Though I failed, I bore no resentment, knowing my studies had not penetrated the profound mechanism, my understanding strayed from the distant truth. Later, after escaping great peril, I chanced upon a perfected one who, moved by my earnest devotion, transmitted to me oral instructions. Bound by oath, he entrusted me with the teaching, swearing it must not be falsely passed on, nor revealed to the uninitiated.

Following his instructions, I cultivated and witnessed the divine workings—so subtle and wondrous, unmatched in marvel. Though Xianzhi □ had attained sudden enlightenment, I was struck with awe, fearing first that my merit and conduct were incomplete, and second that my bones were light and my fate fragile. I saw that those who pursued this path were often of noble birth—emperors’ sons, princes, scholars of refined talent, gentlemen of great ability. Countless thousands set their hearts upon it, yet scarcely two or three achieved renown. Truly, this attainment does not favor the highborn; success depends solely on one’s destined portion.

Xianzhi, ashamed to be but a common soldier, had nonetheless encountered the immortal formula. I beheld the root of true lead and true mercury, discerned the beginning and end of true water and true fire. The pivotal yellow sprout lay grasped in my palm; the profound mysteries of autumn stone filled my breast. Such fortune surpassed all expectation—one in ten thousand might chance upon it.

Thus, Xianzhi reformed his ways and devoted himself to the Dao, forsaking extravagance. Clad in hempen robes, content with simplicity, he cultivated virtue and preserved spirit, aiding those in need. Recently, in leisure, I reflected upon my fellow seekers—how they squandered their minds and wearied their viscera, striving after the elixir’s tortoise, mistaking snakes for dragons. Countless such errors have arisen, all in vain. Unaware of the true root of lead and mercury, they engage in deceptive alchemy. The eight minerals surge wildly; the five metals are scorched and spent.

Now, I humbly offer my humble insights to urge and encourage those of shared aspiration. The great medicine exists; the returned elixir is real. One must achieve inner and outer harmony, heart and mouth in accord. Spare no toil, seek the presence of the enlightened. I inscribe these ten verses to share with fellow practitioners, that together we may ascend beyond the clouds and forever escape the dust.

**The Supreme Medicine of the Returned Elixir**
Composed by Wu Xuzi Xianzhi Yingtu

Long have I indulged in the supreme art, toiling through twenty springs,
Sifting through immortal scriptures, seeking white mercury in fire’s glow.
In a fleeting instant, within water’s depths, I beheld lead’s silver gleam.
At last, I knew my lifelong aspiration was not in vain—
Awakened from the dreamlike body of old illusions.
For long years, I burned aloeswood and sandalwood in incense,
Purifying my heart to pay homage to the Jade Emperor’s truth.

Ashamed, a mere soldier risen from the camp’s gate,
Who could have foreseen the raven’s light illuminating the overturned basin?
I grasped the mutual overcoming of the five phases,
Discerned the dragon and tiger locked in devouring struggle.
South becomes north, and north follows south;
What flees as being is stored as non-being, yet non-being does not cease to be.
Only when minds align may one speak of this—
To those unfit, the discourse remains unspoken.

Truly, such an encounter is heaven-sent;
Amid the dust, mortal eyes perceive the cinnabar field.
The divine principle, though silent, imparts its near-silence;
Within the scrolls of immortal scriptures, I awakened to single-minded clarity.
The yellow sprout refined, I beheld within the furnace;
The sacred stone cultivated, I held upon my palm.
Though my heart has escaped the dust, my body remains bound—
All worldly affairs now seem but idle distraction.

Upon perusing the *Cantong Qi*, my eyes grew bright:
The yellow sprout thrives even in the world’s midst.
Yet all men are deluded, seeking where it cannot be found;
Each wanders in confusion, journeying far in vain.
Four substances cycle as root and origin;
Two essences harmonize, contracting at the first sprouting.
The river chariot gradually transforms the fetal form,
Turning the green dragon and white tiger into new shapes.

Awakening to true lead, I was struck with awe—
Fearful that amid the dust, my body might await divine judgment.
My merit unrefined, my root shallow,
I dwell among the unenlightened, anxious my bones are too light.
From this moment, I pitied the waters and earth,
No longer coveting gold and jade.
When the cauldron of heaven and earth is complete, the years fulfilled,
I shall carry my elixir gourd toward the Crimson City.

I have heard of the immortal elixir that transcends the world—
Seekers are as numerous as hemp seeds, yet few attain it.
They merely refine the four yellows, attack the eight minerals,
Unknowing what form the dragon and tiger assume.
Diligently, they pore over scriptures,
Endlessly unrolling myriad scrolls.
For thirty years, they toil without respite,
Yet frost whitens their temples before true lead is known.

A hundred million seek in vain;
From ancient times to now, this matter is profoundly obscure.
The southern work flourishes in the vermilion summer;
The northern refinement transforms radiance into white autumn.
With bitter resolve, they refine without method;
With single-minded devotion, they cultivate without aim.
They search to the ends of the earth,
Yet before encountering it, their hair turns white with snow.

The immortal elixir’s divine art is wondrous and rare;
From ancient times to now, few have attained it.
Those of shallow wisdom and narrow measure—what can they perceive?
Even the enlightened ponder, still harboring doubt.
From non-being to being, the divine is unfathomable;
From being to non-being, even sages know not.
Marvel not that immortal scriptures remain hidden—
They are preserved lest the celestial mechanism be revealed.

The returned elixir is vast and boundless, difficult to fathom;
Without destined affinity, one may never encounter it through a thousand lives.
Once attained, it must be guarded and concealed—
Do not equate it with gold and jade.
When refined, the sparrow and swallow dine as phoenixes;
When awakened, the snake and fish feed as dragons.
Such divine workings defy description—
How could one idly speak of them to the foolish?

Know that perfection is not easily achieved—
Truly, it is a thousandfold, ten-thousandfold difficult.
The world knows only minor arts of preservation;
Who would undertake the great returned elixir?
Gold and silver are spoken of with delight,
But at the mention of lead and mercury, men seem lost in dreams.
Thus, countless errors arise through the ages—
Before fifty, their temples are streaked with gray.

**The Supreme Elixir of the Returned Cinnabar**

When one awakens to true lead, the reversal stirs awe;
In this dusty world, the body awaits the divine.
Without cultivating merit and conduct, the root is shallow,
And among the unenlightened, the bones are deemed light.

From this moment, the heart pities the waters and earth;
From now on, no desire lingers for gold and jade.
When the cauldron of heaven and earth is complete and the years are full,
Take up the elixir gourd and journey to the Crimson City.

It is said that transcendent cinnabar exists beyond the world—
Seekers are as numerous as hemp, yet those who attain it are rare.
They merely refine the Four Yellows and attack the Eight Stones,
Unknowing what form the Dragon and Tiger assume.

Diligent only in unrolling scriptures to read,
Stubbornly poring over ten thousand scrolls,
They toil for thirty years in vain—
Frosted temples, yet true lead remains unseen.

A hundred million seek, yet cannot find;
From ancient times to now, this matter runs deep and obscure.
In the south, the work aligns with the vermilion summer;
In the north, the radiant countenance turns to white autumn.

With bitter resolve, they refine but find no method;
With single-minded devotion, they cultivate—yet how?
They search far and wide to the ends of the earth,
Yet before meeting it, their hair is white with snow.

The divine art of the transcendent elixir is profoundly wondrous;
From ancient times to now, those who attain it are few.
What can shallow wisdom and narrow measure perceive?
Even the lofty-minded ponder and still harbor doubt.

From non-being into being, the divine is unfathomable;
From being into non-being, even sages do not know.
No wonder the immortal scriptures remain long concealed—
Their transmission fears the leakage of heavenly secrets.

Boundless, the returned elixir is difficult to fathom;
Without destined affinity, one may never encounter it through a thousand lives.
Once attained, it must be guarded and concealed—
Do not equate it with gold and jade.

When refined, the sparrow and swallow dine as phoenixes;
When awakened, the snake and fish feed as dragons.
Such divine workings defy description—
How could one idly speak of them to the foolish?

Know that perfection is not easily achieved—
Truly, it is a thousandfold, ten-thousandfold difficult.
The world knows only minor arts of preservation;
Who would undertake the great returned elixir?

Gold and silver are spoken of with delight,
But at the mention of lead and mercury, men seem lost in dreams.
Thus, countless errors arise through the ages—
Before fifty, their temples are streaked with gray.
