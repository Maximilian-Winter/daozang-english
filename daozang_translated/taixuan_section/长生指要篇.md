**Preface to *Essentials of Longevity***

In my youth, I was afflicted by sorrow, my brush and ink neglected, and I grew weary of worldly tastes. Then, upon reading the *Scripture on Purity and Stillness (Qīngjìng Jīng)*, I awoke to self-examination. Thus, I abandoned my home with a resolute heart, clad in rags and barefoot, wandering and seeking across half the land. As for the practices of *visualizing the kidneys to nurture the heart* and *swallowing saliva to internalize qi*, I tried them all. Yet what lingered in my mind was the matter of *Golden Elixir (Jīndān)*, whose roots I had yet to fathom.

Then, fate unfolded—**Master Lǚ Zhēnrén of Western Shu** appeared before me at the **Yānxīá Dàoyuàn** in Chángtíng. With joy, he entrusted me with the secrets of elixir refinement: the methods of *fire regulation, adding and reducing*, all as clear as the palm of my hand. For years now, I have followed his teachings with reverence!

Seeing how common folk stray into convoluted side paths, ever farther from the Dao, I could not bear to keep these truths hidden. Thus, I expounded in subtle words, setting them down in seven chapters, naming this work *Essentials of Longevity (Chángshēng Zhǐyào)*. May those with sincere intent thereby attain enlightenment!

**Chapter One**

I have heard that the **Primordial Dao** lies within the **Hun-tun**—unfathomable by perception, ungraspable by cognition. Listen with the ears and hear with the eyes; see with the eyes and perceive with the ears. Vague and indistinct, dim and obscure, neither form nor image, yet named as **Dao**. The subtlety of the Dao being beyond measure, one must only gaze upward and downward to comprehend it. When aligned with the human body, it fits like matching seals.

Having attained the **mystery within the mystery**, the **subtlety within the subtlety**, I dare not keep it entirely concealed. Thus, from the realm of **Being and Non-Being**, I reveal its roots. The **Receptive (Yīn)** is the undivided black of **Hun-tun**, like the stem of a gourd, containing the true essence. The **black qi** permeates, blending with **Creation**,—is this not the marvel of **Taiyi** embracing the true **qi**?

Once the **Two Principles (Yīn-Yáng)** are distinguished, the **Four Symbols** emerge, and from them, the **Five Phases** manifest. Then the **Eight Trigrams** are arranged, with the **central palace** as their origin. The central palace is the domain of **Earth**. Thus, water finds stability in Earth, fire finds rest, metal finds life, and wood flourishes—like a child in its mother’s womb, nourished by the **primordial black qi** of Heaven and Earth, aligned with the central palace, breathing in unison. Once the embryo forms and the umbilical cord is severed, the received **true black qi** of Heaven and Earth, infused with the **Divine Sovereign’s spirit-qi**, merges with the primordial harmony, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth, sharing in their transformation.

Yet when **emotions and desires** stir within and without, when **pleasures and attachments** arise, the **qi** separates from the true, the **original spirit** follows external allurements. Though it mingles with the **true qi** of Heaven and Earth, without a foundation for **transformation**, it is instead seized by them, causing the body to decay and the **qi** to fade—thus, death becomes inevitable.

This **qi** is the **Primordial Chaos’s ancestral breath**, the **source of immortal life and fate**. To possess it is to live; to lose it is to die. Those who attain it **plunder Heaven and Earth’s creation**; those who fail are **plundered by them**—what is lost is the **single point of original yang-qi**.

Practitioners of cultivation, why not return to the **Root** and refine according to the seasons, forging the **Great Elixir**? The method of refinement is simple: inhale when the **Mother** exhales, exhale when the **Mother** inhales. Each inhalation draws **Heaven’s qi** downward; each exhalation raises **Earth’s qi** upward. Breathing follows its natural rhythm, not blindly forced—stir one spirit, and all spirits move; open one orifice, and all orifices open.

Seekers of the Dao must trace its source, as if still within the **mother’s womb**, embracing the **Primordial**, guarding the **One**. **Taiyi** contains the true **qi**; Heaven and Earth nurture the **Yellow Sprout**. The **Yellow Sprout** is the **mother of Lead**—those who fail to cultivate see their **qi** severed, their life extinguished, unable to **reclaim the lost light** and reflect inward, fixated only on the external.

**Huíyáng Zǐ** says: The **essence of Heaven and Earth** gathers in the **sun and moon**; the **essence of humanity** resides in the **eyes**. When a person takes form, the **kidneys** emerge first, corresponding to the **Wheel of Essence** within. Then the **eyes** form, like water droplets, mirroring Heaven and Earth in their purity. Before Heaven and Earth divided, before the **Two Luminaires** shone, all was **Hun-tun**, dim and obscure. When the **Two Principles** separated, the **Two Luminaires** illuminated, **water and fire** emerged, and all things were born—thus arises the marvel of **transformation**.

To cultivate, one must extract the **Primordial qi** beneath the **horizontal eyes**, seeking the **Heavenly-Earthly essence** and applying it. If this subtlety is mastered, it is called **soaring beyond sun and moon**, piercing the **Kunlun peaks**. Ancestors of the Dao taught no other path.

The **Yellow Court** is the **furnace and cauldron** where sacred deeds are forged, where **divinity** is born. **Pure above, turbid below**, the path connects the **Eight Waters**, ascending to the **Sea of Marrow**, regulating the **Five Qi**, blending the **Hundred Spirits**, descending to the **Gushing Spring**, cycling endlessly day and night. The **true essence of Heaven and Earth**, along with the **spirit without form**, may be united here. When the **ten months** of cultivation are complete, the **embryo is born**—smallly, it grants longevity and joy; greatly, it transcends humanity to sainthood. Wandering in transformation, unbound in Heaven and Earth, when virtue is complete, one ascends to the **Jade Emptiness Above**. Such alchemy is profound and wondrous—how can cultivators of the **Elixir** not devote themselves to the **Dao**?

**Chapter Two**

**Huíyáng Zǐ** says: The **Dao** and **Nature** are one continuous principle. Heaven, possessing **qi**, covers all below; Earth, possessing **substance**, supports all above. Between them lies **eighty-four thousand li**. **Qi** and **substance** cannot naturally intermingle—Heaven, through **Kàn**, reaches into **Kùn**, returning to Earth, its **yang** bearing **yīn** upward; Earth, through **Kùn**, reaches into **Kàn**, returning to Heaven, its **yīn** embracing **yang** downward. In this endless rise and fall, they never stray from the **Dao**, thus enduring forever. There is no other reason.

Moreover, the **Nature of Heaven and Earth** is humanity’s most noble inheritance.

**Chapter Two (continued)**

The **Heart** compares to Heaven and bears the name **Vermilion Bird**, manifesting in the eyes as **red veins**; the **Kidneys** compare to Earth and bear the name **Dark Warrior**, affecting the eyes with **essence-qi**. The **Liver**, as the **yang** position, is likened to the **Green Dragon**, its essence appearing green in the eyes; the **Lungs**, as the **yin** position, are likened to the **White Tiger**, their essence appearing white when seen.

Heaven and Earth’s transformative forces converge entirely in the eyes. If one harmonizes them with clarity, the source of transformation is revealed—probing the **Kàn-Lì** phases, aligning with the dynamic rhythms of **symbols and correspondences**, day and night. With focused spirit and forgotten schemes, preserving light and embracing brightness, how could one fail to unite in **virtue** with Heaven and Earth?

Yet, from the moment humans separate from their parents, they are stained by the **six dusts**, their **Heavenly Five Qi** scattered and stripped away, their senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue—entangled by sounds and colors. Thoughts stray from their proper place; external openness leads to inner dimness. When obstructed by the **Yellow Center**, the body fractures, its completeness lost to a single crooked path. Turning away from the root to chase the superficial, they forget to return, and the **Dao-heart** is veiled, hidden and unseen!

How could they then unite in **virtue** with Heaven and Earth? Not only do they fail to unite, but they further corrupt it with change—until the **Original Yang** is depleted, the **True Qi** lost, all because external things blind the eyes, and **essence** floats above **nature**, daily expending its light outward.

Alas! Why do those who study the **Dao** not awaken the depths of the *Yì* and reflect upon this?

Moreover, when **Kùn’s** proper position enters **Kàn’s** proper position, adding two strokes within, it becomes **Kàn**—for **Kàn-water** is internally luminous. If one penetrates the luminous nature of water, clarity flows unimpeded; if one clings to the luminous nature of fire, darkness multiplies. For above and below are both **yang** strokes, only red remains—yet when **Yellow** resides centrally, light emerges. Thus, **Lì-fire** is red from beginning to end, but excessive redness turns black.

What reliance can one place in this within humanity?

「Thus, those who cling to the external luminosity—this is the principle of the *Yì*’s light illuminating the Western River. Those who do not return to its source—this is the meaning of the separation between gold and wood.

Only the enlightened ones, when encountering each and every realm, follow their perception and restore it, thereby seizing its luminosity and returning to its essence, thus preserving the **virtue/power** of **Kùn**. When one preserves their **virtue/power**, their **nature** does not stray; when **nature** does not stray, the **spirit** does not wander; when the **spirit** does not wander, the **essence** does not disperse; when the **essence** does not disperse, the **True Qi** gathers. When **True Qi** gathers, the **essence** and **Lì-fire** follow in tandem; when **essence** and **Lì-fire** follow in tandem, the myriad **spirits** align with the **Primordial Origin**. The three flowers converge at the crown, maintaining the **Great Harmony**, and one attains immediate transcendence, achieving the radiance of the **Nine Tripod Elixir**, piercing the **Void Realm**, and aligning with the **Pure and Clear** in its transformation. Only then does one reside before the **Great Primordial Chaos** of **Tàichū**.

If not so, even at the moment of blinking, distinctions between self and others arise!

**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: The **Dao**’s natural course completes the twelve **Earthly Branches** and **Celestial Stems**, totaling ninety-six **kè** (moments). It encompasses all of heaven and earth, yet penetrates the finest hairs of autumn. The common folk, unaware, mistakenly insert four **kè** into the **Zǐ-wu-xǐ-yǒu** (Child-Midday-Mao-Western) cycle—this is all incorrect. Heaven and earth’s creation cannot be increased or diminished; to increase is to prolong, to diminish is to shorten. Heaven has ten **gān** (Celestial Stems), which are **yang** numbers, the root; earth has twelve **zhī** (Earthly Branches), which are **coupled** numbers, the end. The common folk follow the **Branches**, while sages follow the **Stems**; the remaining **kè** lie within them!

**Lǎozǐ** said: *"When the root descends and the end flows, the myriad things are born."* The root delves into the foundation and secures the origin; the end blooms and bears fruit. When the melon ripens, the stem detaches—its fragrance arises naturally. Only those who split the melon truly know its flavor.

To know: those who study the **Dao** must cultivate **spirit** and **Qi** fully. It is unnecessary to be bound by years, months, days, or **shí-chén** (times). This is the principle of *"form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the **Dao** in truth."* Further, to delve into **nature**’s ultimate essence and ascend a step higher, one must attain **nature** and **life** as an indivisible whole, unrestricted in coming and going.

After achieving **True Stillness**, a point of luminous **spirit** pierces the **Jade Pool**—this is the **Mysterious Feminine**. Before heaven and earth were differentiated, they were like a chicken egg, hence the **Primordial Origin** is contained within the **Great Primordial Origin**. Before **Huntingian Chaos** was resolved, heaven and earth first divided: the **Primordial** is the substance, the **Post-Primordial** is the function. The light and clear ascend as heaven, the heavy and turbid descend as earth; the center is the human body—this is the **Three Talents**, the fixed source of all things.

Internally, the **Mysterious Feminine** is the root of heaven and earth; externally, it is the gateway of birth and death. Piercing the **Great Primordial Chaos**’s aperture, surging through the **Upper Vertex Pass**, boundless **immortals** emerge from here, and the myriad ages rank among the **Celestial Assembly**.

The teacher **Xiè** reveals the root and source: one escapes the cycle of **rebirth** and **samsara** externally, dwelling in mountains or cities with ease, hidden or revealed without obstruction in coming and going.

**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: *"From having arises non-having; from non-having arises having; from non-having emerges having; from having emerges non-having."* Thus, the *Xiāozāi Jīng* (Scripture of Eliminating Calamities) states: *"Having having and non-having having, the end is ever dark and unclear, unable to self-illuminate."* Yet those who illuminate the mind and perceive **nature** differ from this—when non-having is non-having and having is having, it diverges from this.

Therefore, **Zǐyáng Zhēnrén** (the **Purple Yang Sage**) said: *"**True Stillness** floats and sinks, distinguishing guest and host."* The root is **nature** as host, and first, **life** is established. The verse says: *"Though he be the guest, I am the host."* This is precisely the **floating and sinking of nature and life**.

For instance, the sun rises from the **Eastern Sea**, its auspicious **Qi** filling the sky, its rosy radiance dazzling. A hundred paces from the sea gate, its light begins to fade. As it nears its setting in the west, its radiance is reclaimed, returning to its origin—so too is this.

Those who study the **Dao** must understand this principle: scattering the **spirit**’s light, one pursues the myriad things. The common folk’s actions are thus, while sages follow perception and restore it, like the sun returning to its origin.

**Cuī Gōng**’s entry into the **Medicine Mirror** is this very principle! Hence it is said: *"The creation of heaven and earth is all gathered in the sun and moon; the creation of humanity is all gathered in the **Primordial Origin**."* Is this not the boundless transformation, enduring as long as heaven and earth?

**Huíyáng Zǐ** said: The **sage’s embryo** matures in ten months, and the infant manifests. Those who study the **Dao** are like a person building a house: first, one must lay the foundation solidly before it can bear weight. Awaiting the birth of **heaven and earth’s single yang**, one takes the month from the year, the day from the month, the **shí-chén** from the day, and the **kè** from the **shí-chén**. When ten months complete the embryo’s circle, the work is fulfilled, and **virtue/power** is attained—just as the common folk, after a thousand days, finally separate from their mother’s milk, gaining autonomy. When **yin** and **yang** meet, the self’s body arises from their union—not sought externally. *"Coming, clouds fill the thousand mountains; departing, the moon spans the ten thousand waters."*

Those who study the **Dao** possess their own **sage father** and **sage mother**, their own **self-born father and mother**. I awaken to seven parts, the teacher refines three parts; I awaken to three parts, the teacher refines seven parts—totaling ten parts. One must awaken and perceive themselves to enter the **Dao**. According to one’s capacity, one accommodates others and bears fruit; the **wooden method** lies entirely in **cultivating the soil**.

I see the world’s people, ever turning in confusion, failing to comprehend the sages’ classics. Once the human body is lost, they face countless kalpas to regain it. Is this not painful?

The **sea of suffering** is boundless—turning back is the path to liberation. It is not my intention now to speak bitterly in vain; I fear only that you may waste precious time. Instead, take it upon yourself to instantly awaken, transcend the mundane, and attain sainthood.

**Zǐyáng Zhēnrén** said: *"When a nation is wealthy and its people at peace, it seeks war; only after war does it see true tranquility."* A wealthy nation brings peace to its people; peaceful people enrich their nation. So too, when a person’s **Primordial Spirit**, **Primordial Darkness**, and **Primordial Essence** return to their proper abodes—the **spirit** to the **spirit chamber**, the **essence** to the **essence palace**, and the **Qi** to its **root**—if these three can return to their origins, then the nation is wealthy and its people at peace.

Further, if one penetrates this profound principle, it becomes the **Three Families Meeting** to form the **embryo of the sage**’s union. When two things meet, their **emotions** and **nature** merge. The **Tiger** and **Dragon** coil together at the center—this is the **soil**. **Wù** is **yang soil**, capable of generating the myriad things; **Jǐ** is **yin soil**, capable of nourishing the myriad things. Thus, the myriad things are born and grow—humanity is likewise.»

The **Venerable Purple Yang** says: *"To long endure the blade and the cup of the sage, as winter snows gather and congeal—this is the very way.*

The laughing infant and the rosy maiden, the Yellow Mother guiding the Master Dīng,
pointing the path across the **Cao Stream**,
ascending the **Kunlun Peak**—
the surging waves descend into the **Yellow Court**,
where **water** and **fire** meet in welcome.

**Master Huiyang** says: *"In this world, the **Spirit** is limited, but the body remains in excess.
Wealth, honor, and glory pass like fleeting blossoms—why weary the mind in pursuit?*

I urge those who cultivate the **Dao** to awaken soon to this truth:
from ancient times, all **Immortal Adepts** entered through this path.
The verse says:
*'Nine ten-thousand branches green and red,
Yet in seasons one sees their roots and shoots—
Do not say this fruit hard to ripen,
For it is watered by a single ladle from the **Sacred Source**.'*

And another verse says:
*'Treading all this world’s farthest shores,
Where does the Yellow Mother dwell?
The Master suddenly reveals the path—
I chop my feet to reach the **Misty Peaks**.'*

**Fourth,** **Master Huiyang** says: *"The **Heaven** has four seasons, the Sun twelve hours—
each hour holds its own profound use.
Those who refine must know the **Spirit’s** hiding and its movements,
past and future, to seize the moment.
Its deepest mystery lies in piercing the years,
clustered months, months clustered with days,
days clustered with hours, hours clustered with moments—
lest even a hair’s breadth be lost.

But the method does not end there.
One must ascend to align with the **celestial movements** of stars and constellations,
descend to harmonize with the **ebb and flow** of ocean tides,
harvest the **Qi** before **Heaven** and **Earth** divide,
and steal the **Essence** where **Sun** and **Moon** converge.
Thus the sage says: *'When Heaven and Earth exchange their times, they also exchange their **Qi**—
Just strike the door at the **Jia-Yi** moment.'*

For within each moment’s labor lies a day’s **Qi** and **timing**,
within each day’s labor lies a year’s **Qi** and **timing**.
One who grasps a year’s labor
can seize the **Heaven’s** and **Earth’s** **three thousand six hundred years** of measure.
How can the **unawakened** presume to fathom this?
Thus the verse says:*

The *Fu* hexagram’s first line moves—
Heaven’s heart shifts not.
Within this grasp of meaning,
The elixir’s foundation is laid.

**Fifth Section:** Master Yangzi said:
The ancient sages transmitted the Great Elixir’s gold,
Yet withheld the fire’s timing—
Not to reveal Heaven’s secrets.

Now I reveal its hidden intent,
This passage as its seal.

Fire’s efficacy lies only in this:
Dispersed, it becomes *qi*;
Concentrated, it becomes fire;
Transformed, it becomes water;
Altered, it becomes gold.

Condense this *qi*—
True essence unscattered—
And the fire’s timing lies within!

Thus it is said:
Fire has its timing, yet needs no hour—
A whisper of mechanism I alone know.
When the *qi* first returns at the new moon’s start,
Adjusting advance and retreat—
Let no delay linger.

Someone asks: How gather the herbs?
How refine the fire’s alchemy?
I reply:
Herbs bear the Mysterious Opening’s life,
Fire ignites the Yang Furnace’s glow.
Adjusting advance and retreat—
All depends on me.
When the *qi* first returns, the Transformation’s pivot is set.

**Sixth Section:** Master Yangzi said:
The Divine Furnace, the Elixir Cavern,
The Jade Chamber, the Golden Room—
These are but names for the alchemical vessel.

The Yellow Court, the Yellow Dao,
The Yellow Chamber, the Yellow Matron,
The Wu-Ji Bright Hall—
These are but names for the Central Palace.

True Yang is *Qian*—Heaven, Father, Husband.
The Yang Soul is the Azure Dragon,
The Lord of Wood, the Mercury of the Male.
Yang within Yin, the Sulfur within the Mercury,
The Cinnabar Father’s essence, the Wooden Fluid—
These are but names for the Infant Brother.

True Yin is *Kun*—Earth, Mother, Wife.
The Yin Spirit is the White Tiger,
The Female Lead, the Silver within the Lead.
Yin within Yang, the Mother’s Blood, the Golden Essence—
These are but names for the Astonished Maiden.

Though names abound, their principle is one.

Lead, neither too distant nor too near,
Must meet the Yang Mercury’s aid.
When it encounters True Earth, it becomes
The Great Elixir’s gold.

Master Ziyang said:
First, take *Qian* and *Kun* as the vessel,
Then drive the Black Hare’s elixir to boil.
Once the Two Creatures return to the Yellow Dao,
How could the Soul Elixir fail to manifest?
This is but one path of the Dao.

The common man scatters one into myriad,
Yet the sage gathers myriad into one—
Thus it is said: *My Dao is one, through which all is threaded.*

Descend to the One—
And the One gives birth to water,
My body’s North Dipper.

The Dipper arises from the One,
The One is the root of life—
My inherent nature,
The meaning of the Three-One Command.

The world’s utmost precision
Thus becomes spirit.
Spirit reaches its peak—
Yet spirit’s virtue never leaves the One.

Zhuangzi said:
*He who does not depart from precision is called the Spiritual Man.*

The One is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all things.
With root, life emerges;
With life, flourishing follows.
If the root is not deepened,
The stem not secured—
How then grasp *Hugging the One*?

From rising to repose, I think of the One.
In eating and drinking, I think of the One.
Never let the thought cease—
For the Great Mysterious One is the Northern Heaven’s *Qi*,
The *Qi* of the *Kan* Palace’s Rectification,
The Dao’s origin.

The One—
The Original One, the Great One,
The Mysterious One, the Founding One—
This *Qi* governs Heaven and Earth’s essence,
Crowns the primacy of Yin and Yang,
Is the root of the Two Luminaries,
The ancestor of all things.

It accumulates the chaos of Yin and Yang,
Its *qi* and essence turning from the *Kan* Palace to the *Dui* direction,
Called the Yang within Yin.

Without Yang in water,
How could it bear all things?

The True Seeker—
If he knows this Mysterious Heaven’s *Qi*
And begins his work from here,
Swiftly he will verify truth and attain the Way.

Now let us examine the North Dipper’s seven stars:
Stars are born from the Sun.
The Dipper arises from *Kan*,
Inheriting the Sun’s essence.

The Sun’s essence, born from the One,
*Kan* as a hexagram—
The Sun and Moon dwell within it!

Though *Li* is the Sun,
And *Kan* the Moon,
This is their division:
*Li* contains five numbers,
*Kan* contains five numbers—
Together, *Kan* and *Li* make ten.

Heaven One, Earth Six,
And *Kan* holds them both—
Thus it encompasses the Sun and Moon’s functions.

Men say the Dipper is northern,
But no—it is born from *Kan*,
Thus called the North Dipper.
It moves through the center,
Thus called the Central Dipper.

The song says:
*The Nine Elements reside in *Kan* at the Pole’s center,
All luminaries guard and transform.
The True Person freely returns to the Dipper’s handle,
Its shadow follows the Moon’s monthly course.*

*Kan* is truly the root of life,
*Li* the void of nature.

As the *Taishang* says in the *True Scriptures of the South and North Dippers*,
It first speaks of the North, then the South.

North is Heaven One,
South is Earth Two.
*Kan* is the Mysterious,
*Li* is the Vermilion.
Vermilion is fire,
Mysterious is water—
Water births fire,
Precision births *qi*.
To speak of the North without the South is impossible.
North and South unite,
*Kan* and *Li* intertwine—
Preserve the essence to enter spirit,
The marvel of their mutual use.

Without spirit and essence,
How could this be life’s command?

Life’s command within life—
Before parents conceived the embryo,
There was no root of life.

Life’s command within life—
Life lies in the Mysterious Origin,
The Mysterious Origin being the Dao’s *qi*.

Within the Mysterious, there is Mysterious—
This is my life.
Within life, there is life—
This is my form.

When essence, *qi*, and spirit are whole,
The body does not decay,
Form and life endure eternally,
In harmony with nature,
As long as Heaven and Earth.

Man’s birth—
Life is his root.
If life does not descend from Heaven,
The Dao cannot give birth.

Its day is natural,
Fixed by nature itself—
Like the command descending, received below.

For when the *qi* of the Nine Heavens descends,
Only then does the embryo form.
If the Nine Heaven’s Marshal does not issue the decree,
Man cannot be born.

Preserve the form, guard the spirit,
Cherish the *qi*, secure the root—
Thus death and decay are never known,
And the immortal’s way is attained.

The precious indeed!

The Classics say:
*"I do not see nor hear—
I do not know of the spirit,
Nor does the spirit depart from me,
Thus enduring with the Dao as long as ages."*

Then it speaks of *"my life is within me,
Not confined by Creation and Transformation."*[*]

The *Sutras of the Seven Primordials* say:
*"The Great Sovereign instructed the Seven Primordials:
'The Lower Primordial generates man,
From the *qi* of the *Yīnyūn* Primordial Unity,
The essence of the Primordial forming,
Endowed with life, one form complete.

The Three Primordials nurture,
The Nine *Qi* cover and protect.
Thus, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper—
Every man possesses them fully.

The first nine stars, the *Potent Dragon* hidden,
Establish the *zi* position—
The Primordial Marshal of the Northern Dipper resides there!

Knowing this Primordial Spirit,
Cultivating its refinement and nourishment,
When form and spirit merge in unity,
The true essence manifests externally,
And the Mysterious Function is fulfilled.'*

The song declares:
*"Without stars, none bow to Heaven’s Enclosure—
Only the true mechanism lies in the dim and distant."*

Thus, the *Chénjī* (Polaris) is the *heart of Heaven*,
With rectitude as its square—
Facing the peak of *Kūnlún*,
Located in the *Purple Palace* of the Northern Pole, *Zhàngdōng*.

At the center of Heaven,
Within the Four Auxiliaries,
Beneath the *Huágài* (Celestial Canopy),
It is the *heart of Heaven*.

Still and unchanging—
It is the Master of the Primordial *Qi*,
The pivot and axis of Heaven and Earth."

The song declares:
*"The true Yang encloses the *qi* in ceaseless motion,
Ascending and descending through the Three Palaces in secret,
Life and death do not concern the floating world’s affairs—
Together they lead the Five Elders to the Golden Platform."*

The Five Elders are the spirits of the Five *Zàng* (Viscera),
Each man has them naturally—
The twelve nodes, the thirty-six minute bones,
Each pore aligned, each pulse connected,
Each node linked.

When cultivation reaches its peak,
Then *golden sinews and jade bones*,
The hundred limbs uncorrupted,
The pure *qi* ascends to become Heaven—
Pure yet purer, spirit yet more spirit,
Yang yet more Yang.

Man receives the Primordial *Qi* of Heaven and is born,
From the Three Pure Ones dividing their Three *Qi* into the Three Primordials—
The Upper *Dān Tiān* (Elixir Field) *Ní Wán Fǔ* (Mud Pellet Palace),
Ascending to correspond with the *Jade Purity* Green *Qi*;
The Middle *Dān Tiān* *Jiàng Gōng Fǔ* (Vermilion Palace),
Ascending to correspond with the *Upper Purity* White *Qi*;
The Lower *Dān Tiān* *Jiāo Huì Fǔ* (Convergence Palace),
Ascending to correspond with the *Supreme Purity* Yellow *Qi*.

This is what was spoken of earlier—
*"Preserving essence to enter the spirit."*

The *Supreme Purity* true soil,
Not the thick, heavy, and turbid earth of the world—
The transforming origin of all things.

Heaven unifies the Three Palaces as one,
Enduring through ten thousand ages without flaw.
The Three Palaces ascend and descend,
Ascending and descending without end—
This is what is meant!

To know one’s own Three Pure Ones—
Why seek above?
To know one’s own *Lǎo Jūn*—
Why search externally?

The *Supreme Sage* says:
*"Essence is my spirit,
*Qi* is my Dao.
Preserve essence and nurture *qi*,
Guard and uphold firm rectitude.

When Yin and Yang unite,
The true form is established—
And the transformation generates the Boy Child.
Test the breath at the nostrils—
It does not reach the ears.
Speak with the mouth—
It does not shake the lungs.
Then the elixir vein forms itself."*

*Qi* transforms into essence,
Essence transforms into spirit,
Spirit transforms into the Boy Child of the Heart.

Within my body reside the thirty-six thousand spirits,
Ever attending at my side.

If this is maintained over time,
Then one’s own Three Pure Ones, one’s own *Lǎo Jūn*, will appear!

Great are the mysteries of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars!
The Seven Stars’ true names and forms—
They are the Seven *Qi* of the Primordial Beginning,
Also the true *Qi* of the seven orifices within the human body.

The Yin-Yang Dipper Stars traverse the twelve *Zhī* (Earthly Branches) above,
The *zi-wǔ-ào-mǎo* (Child-Midday-Male Ox-Western Maid) palaces—
Within them lies the path to transcend the mundane and enter the sacred!

Thus, the fourth star *Wén Qū* (Literature Weaver),
Is the gate of Yin-Yang convergence—
The *zi-wǔ-ào-mǎo* positions where man is born.
The *ào-mǎo* (Male Ox-Western Maid) convergence occurs here,
And moreover, within Yin there is Yang,
Within Yang there is Yin—
This is called the *Two-Eight* Gate.

The *Dān* (Alchemy) Classics say:
*"The Dragon moves through the sixteen gates,
The Tiger hides in the nine and three doors—
Within the Heavenly Pass,
Its path is the Mysterious Extremity."*

Man can understand the mutual use of Yin and Yang,
The interplay of *Wū-Tù* (Heavenly Hare),
Thus the Dao’s *Qi* increases,
And the elixir spirit is accomplished.

The *Huáng Tíng* (Yellow Court) Classics say:
*"Within the Three Passes, essence, *Qi*, and spirit reside,
Within the Nine Profound, profound yet more profound.
The mouth is the Heavenly Pass—spirit’s mechanism,
The hands are the Human Pass—holding the flourishing and decline,
The feet are the Earthly Pass—life’s threshold.
And within the Dipper, the Three Passes are possessed—
The Heavenly Pass is at *wǔ*,
The Human Pass is at *ào-mǎo*,
The Earthly Pass is at *zi-wǔ*.
The Yin-Yang boundary positions,
The *ào-mǎo* doors where sun and moon enter and exit."*

Reflect now!
The Mysterious is the origin of all things,
Its principle inherent.

The hidden Mysterious of things,
Not as hidden as the Mysterious within the human body—
The Mysterious within the human body,
Is the Heavenly Mechanism,
The Mysterious Function.

Thus the *Yīn Fú* (Dark Seal) Classics say:
*"The sacred function is born from it,
The spirit and light emerge from it!"*

It is known:
The Mysterious is the origin of *Qi*,
The true of the Dao,
Heaven’s hue,
The marvel of the Law,
The profundity of principle,
Water’s source.

If one exhausts its principle,
Must construct its Mysterious,
Fulfill its nature,
Then reaching to its life.

Consider the beginning when *Hún Dùn* (Chaos) was undivided—
Where were the years, months, days, and hours?

Spirit is nature, *Qi* is life—
Spirit does not stray externally, *Qi* regulates itself.

The work is complete!
The seventh.

Huì-Yáng Zǐ said:
The Golden Elixir’s great medicine,
Indeed lies in what the Master transmits,
Yet also in Heaven’s favor.

Our Daoist Ancestor, the Most High Laozi,
In the *Dàodé Jīng* says:
*"Heaven’s Way has no favorites,
It always aids the virtuous."*

Our Ancestor, Master Wèi Bóyáng,
In the *Cāntóng Qì* says:
*"Heaven’s Way has no fixed path,
It is transmitted only to the worthy."*

Our Ancestor, Pure Yang True Person,
In the *Qìn Yuán Chūn* says:
*"The path of the humble gourd,
With three thousand deeds fulfilled,
Alone strides back to the clouds."*

Our Ancestor, Master Zhāng,
In his poem says:
*"The Great Medicine’s cultivation has ease and difficulty,
I know it depends on me and on Heaven—
If not for accumulated merit and hidden virtue,
Every move invites demons to obstruct."*

Again, in the *Xī Jiāng Yuè*:
*"If virtue surpasses eight hundred,
And hidden deeds reach three thousand,
Balancing all beings, kin, and grudges,
Only then does one fulfill the true wish of the Immortals."*

Indeed, the completion of the Golden Elixir
Is Heaven’s reward for the greatly virtuous.
If one does not cultivate hidden virtue
But merely seeks to steal the Great Dao,
Then Heaven will not aid them.
Even if they begin the practice,
Demons will soon arise to obstruct,
Or for years they toil in vain,
Only to blame the Dao or the Master,
And thus bring ruin upon themselves.

But if there are those who truly seek the Dao,
Ever mindful, compassionate, and aiding beings,
Rescuing the poor, relieving suffering,
Cherishing life, saving all sentient beings,
Encouraging loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness,
And performing all manner of hidden virtues—
Such as truly sparing life,
Or practicing skillful means to abstain from killing—
Then the Immortals will recommend them,
The Celestial Sovereign will bestow blessings.
They will swiftly find a clear Master,
Receive true transmission,
Begin cultivation with swift results,
Heaven aiding them, all spirits protecting,
No demonic obstructions, every action aligning with the True Principle.
In due time, the work will be complete,
Living in the world, eternally transcendent,
Ascending to the clouds,
Form and spirit both perfected,
Free and unbound.
Moreover, their blessings extend to descendants,
Enduring under the Dao’s shelter—
This, though the Master’s grace,
Is truly Heaven’s gift.

Twenty years of seeking the Dao,
Traversing ten thousand rivers and mountains,
No clear Master found—how could one rest?
How many times did I raise a single incense stick in prayer?

Fortunate to meet the Perfect One,
Who revealed the wondrous use of the Void,
The work accomplished in an instant,
Divine light radiant throughout the body.

*Xī Jiāng Yuè*
From death’s embrace, reborn again,
Returning to recognize the true self—
This journey’s boat, though bound for the coffin,
No eight winds can shake it.

A midnight moon wheel,
The Supreme Ultimate Diagram,
Ten thousand *lǐ* of clear azure,
Green peaks dissolving into clouds.

Joy supreme, joy supreme,
Common folk say it’s hard to find—
When asked what I do,
Silence is the Great Return.

*Jīn Dān Hé Cháo Hòu Tú*
*"Chisel open Chaos to reveal the Qiantang River,
The southern sky’s Yangtze as a silver screen—
Poets past and present have painted this scene,
Yet who can truly trace its origin?"*

Years pass, years return,
Days of *Gēng*, months of *Jiǎ*—
Why this sudden chaos?
Now it is revealed:
To know Heaven and Earth’s true source.

The Dao disperses, yet one name prevails—
The Five Phases in reverse,
Mutually arrayed in Heaven and Earth’s cycles.

The *Kǎn* Water flows backward toward the *Bǐng* Gate,
Following the waxing and waning of the moon,
Qi peaking at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Gold can generate Water,
Doubly surging like a thousand layers of snow—
The Immortals’ wondrous use
Differs not from the tides.

This ode to the *Jiāngyuè* Moon,
Silently aligning with the Heavenly Cycle’s numbers,
Thus the Tidal Chart is recorded here,
To show those of shared intent.
