**《Xié Hóng》 (解红) – *Untangling the Red***
**By Lǚ Chún Yáng (吕纯阳)**

*Dòng Tiān Shēn Chù* (洞天深处) – *In the depths of the Celestial Cavern,*
The Dao is not distant—yet within arm’s reach, few can awaken.
Like a child lost in inner visions, one must rely on the artisan’s skill and labor.
Waiting eagerly for dawn’s light, when a single ray of yang illuminates the path to the mysterious.
All treasures lie hidden in the fathomless jade-green waves.

At that moment, the master descends—
Earth’s thunder shakes the mountain peaks, rain pours forth.
Gradually, the golden buds are nourished, now emerging from the soil.
Like a babe plucked from the earth, carried in a basket to depart.
Toward the true realm of six yangs, where the cauldron’s fire simmers.
The essence is refined, east and west, south and north—
Laying out the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces,
To discern the lineage of the ancestors.
Within the Ten Celestial Stems, left and right are divided,
To reveal the Dragon and the Tiger.
With the Black Tortoise following and the Vermilion Bird leading,
Auspicious clouds spread.
On the River of the Curved Banks,
All deities gather—husbands and wives.
The *Gǔi Mǔ* (癸母) rides the Red Dragon,
Returning to the Cavern’s palace.
Seeking the Golden Old Man,
One must ask through [the proper] means.
The union of yin and yang spans three thousand cycles.

Pointing to heaven, earth, sea, and mountain,
Their shared longevity is unshaken and firm.

---
**《Wú Lì Wǎng Zǐ》 (吴立网子) – *Master Wú’s Net of Illusions***

To become an immortal, one must embrace the *yuán qì* (元炁),
Breathing in the womb, nurturing it endlessly.
Each breath is a refining, each exhalation a distillation.
Yin and yang merge, the Red Dragon coils.
The earthly portal is sealed, the heavenly gate opens—
Rolling the cinnabar elixir into the *níhuàn* (泥丸),
The marrow’s core.
On Kunlun’s heights, the luminous pearl glows,
And the agate shimmers.
One furnace’s fire extinguishes another’s elixir.
The heart’s ashes reveal five colors, radiant and bright.
On the double-gated path, the *qi* flows unbroken.
Clasping the true flower, ascending to the elixir field.
The *Cháng Nǚ Yīng’ér* (姹女婴儿) rejoices in union,
Riding the celestial chariot, earthly fire and thunder shift.
The *Lì Quán Jiǔ* (醴泉酒) is drunk—
At every moment, after sipping, one lies intoxicated in the Peach Blossom Source.
No cares to dissolve.

---
**《Wú Sú Niàn》 (无俗念) – *Without Worldly Thoughts***

The profound Dao of Complete Perfection is boundless,
Wondrously attained by those who grasp the essence of the Perfect Ones.

The Dao of Primal Mystery is spoken through—
Silently intuiting its movements within.
All things fully manifested in essence,
Responding to circumstances, uniquely revealed—
Awakened, life’s completion is achieved.

Though this truth is clear,
The practice demands unbroken, meticulous refinement.
Bow the head to hide the celestial secret.
Without the Master’s guidance,
How could this be known?

Who governs the myriad classes of the Three Realms?
The foundation of Heaven and Earth stands alone.
Endless transformations,
Boundless containment—
Its operations leave no trace.

Piercing the void,
Radiant light pervades the boundless expanse.
The Three Reds dissolve—
For the True Person of Unity,
The Primal Oneness is split asunder.

When does the cycle of the Four Births and Six Paths cease?
Turning the body, changing the shell,
In the boundless void, myriad births and deaths unfold.
All arise from parents,
Yin and Yang paired, their vital *qi* and blood mingling.
Within the amniotic sac,
Feeling takes form, the embryo’s shape is sealed.
Who knows the stench of the birth canal?
Taking it as one’s own fine dwelling.
Burrowing in, one falls into the wheel of transmigration.
The form and bones are sold—
Piled high like mountains.

Seeking the Dao and cultivating the True,
Do not cling to perverse ways.
Speak not of the Dragon and Tiger,
Nor debate the Tortoise and Serpent.
Do not pursue the *Cháng Nǚ Yīng’ér*,
But gather the Four Symbols and Three Vehicles.
*Sword-pill* and *lead-mercury*—
Water, fire, golden sprouts, and white snow.

A hundred methods of breathing,
Yet the *shén* (神) harmonizes with *qi* (氣) in subtle play.
Within nature, let no foreign thing take root,
On the heart, ever sever all attachments.
Alone, the hidden moon shines deep and still.
Free the luminous spirit—
Unobstructed, unbound.
No barriers, no veils.

**[Zhengtune Mode] Black Lacquer Bow #1**
**Qiu Changchun**
My home is at the edge of the Parrot State,
A fisherman who does not know his letters.
Amidst the waves, a single leaf of a flat-bottomed boat,
Sleeping through the misty rains of the southern Jiang.
Awakening, my eyes are filled with verses—
Green mountains at dusk, shaking off the green raincoat to depart.
In thought, I recall how I once blamed the Craft of Heaven,
Yet even so, it has arranged my place.

The Celestial Moon #2 sinks in the day’s light,
The sun sets in the west—
Ascending the lofty terrace,
Gazing far, the vast emptiness of heaven and earth unfolds.
Sparse stars flicker faintly,
**[Empty Mode]** A single breath of brightness—
The luminous moon, resplendent and without grasp.
Radiant beyond the Three Realms,
Like a hundred-fold refined bronze mirror, washed clean.
Its grace pervades everywhere,
Illuminating every household,
Casting a dim glow upon halls and doors.

The wind of eternal life sweeps ten thousand leagues,
Aiding the Dao in its boundless sway,
Scattering clouds and mists without effort.
The Hall of Celestial Treasures,
Now bathed in crimson radiance and golden splendor,
Their hues intermingling in splendor.
Oh, the grandeur of the fading night!
It steadies the eternal—
A majestic, unyielding embrace.

If one has resolve to climb the green cassia,
At the Moon Palace’s edge, near the rabbit’s abode,
They watch the elixir being refined.

**Spring Descends from Heaven**
**Feng Zunshi**
The Dao is profound and mysterious.

The Dao appears like the moon full in the cold void,
Its depths like water humbling into the abyss.
Resplendent and clear, it discerns all without bias—
Truly, this principle is beyond speech.

Ask the lofty sage, who points from afar:
"See the falling petals and drifting silk of spring!"
Grass stretches to the sky.
Ah, the yellow blossoms and verdant bamboos—
What difference from true Zen?

Clouds and mountains in ten thousand layers,
Broken and continuous,
Yet deeper still the quiet valleys and ravines,
Cold as stones in deep pools.
Mist enfolds the pine pavilions,
A breeze stirs the orchid halls.
At times, it rests upon a pure table,
Forgetting all explanation.

Before the empty hall’s untrammelled grace,
The heart grows still—
Naturally serene, beyond all taste.
To whom shall it be passed?

There are jars and lamps, their flickering flames,
Kettles and cauldrons, their smoke sunk low.

**The Second Verse**
The sun and moon race heavenward.
This profound and wondrous mechanism—
How rare for dusty mortals to hear!
In the **Taiyi’s** cauldron,
By the mouth of the pure river,
Lingzhi mushrooms bloom, their orchid fragrance rising.
Behold the golden lotus’ splendid scene,
Spouting auspicious clouds,
Unveiling the gate of life.
The Dao alone is revered.
It further nurtures the myriad transformations,
Covering and sustaining the heavens and earth.
How then does one enjoy the four seasons?
Through endless, silent continuity—
Firm roots, unshaken foundation.
Opposing and yielding to yin and yang,
Exhausting and penetrating past and present,
Responding to change like a god.

This is the ultimate Daoist truth,
Transcending names and forms,
Sudden enlightenment of the true essence.
The rare and refined.

Toward **Huaxu’s** gathering,
Together savoring eternal spring.

**The Third Verse**
**Recognizing the rise and fall,**
All things forgotten, dwelling in rustic ease.
Worldly fame and fortune,
Sky-shaking wealth and rank—
None escape the objects’ relentless pull.
Ah, within the **Southern Grove’s** dream,
How many wise and foolish souls were lost!
This humble abode—
Who would count the share of each?
Who would dare return?

Only I, carefree and unbound,
Let nature guide me—
Free as the wind, without constraint.
Straw hats and raincoats stacked idle,
Lutes and books hung high,
Worldly tasks grown cold and distant.
Upon the stone between the pines,
I chant of wind and moon—
Of **clouds and waters**, emotions unconfined.
In the company of **Pure Void**,
Resting on misty peaks,
True joy knows no end.

**Understanding Red**,
I lean upon a staff and walk slowly.

**Crossing the little bridge,**
I wander freely to the Southern Marsh.
The bloom of youth has faded unseen—
Suddenly, the willows turn emerald once more.

The eastern suburbs after the rain’s retreat,
Where does the golden oriole’s languid song drift?
Gazing upon clouds and mountains, veiled and revealed,
Beyond the misty stream, the setting sun grows pale.
As evening’s cool breath lingers,
The bamboo wind carries its fragrant passage.

This idle span of time—
To whom shall I confide its fleeting weight?
A hundred years in this dusty world—
How few can they truly count?
Like bubbles on the water’s surface,
Fading in and out—
The lost may never wake to their true nature.

Returning now, I fear the fields may grow wild,
The garden overrun with neglect.
By the eastern fence,
I laugh at the world’s petty schemes, my heart unbound—
No care for lutes or books.

Within the **green pine’s** shade,
Beneath the thatched eaves,
I tend my frail, remaining frame.
Let the world’s **objects and transformations** churn and rage,
Driving the tides of past and future.
Better I, who drift through life—
Lazy, poor, and plain—
When spirits rise, I sing;
When weary, I sleep;
When wild, I dance.
All worldly affairs, their tangled fuss,
I leave to drift beyond my ken.
Let others call me fool, let them think me crude.
With **clear wind and bright moon** as my companions,
I hide in secluded **hut and marsh**—
A **Second Lord’s** slow gait,
**Dan Yang’s** ease,
And the **Xian**’s aloof grace.

「Then take action—first, dispel lust and desire.
Seek the noble man of jade-like purity and ice-like clarity.
Do not linger, mired in mud and splashed by water.
Once lost, the human body is hard to reclaim.
Do not trifle with your fate—guard your future path with care.

Now I briefly recount:
Five essentials for enduring life and long vision—rely upon these.
First, purify all thoughts and worries.
Second, renounce greed and abstain from wine, meat, and fish.
Third, aid the poor and relieve suffering.
Fourth, always practice benevolence and charity.
Fifth, preserve your vital essence and spirit.

Follow these five principles,
Perform deeds with perfect virtue,
And you shall attain the Daoist path to Penglai.
*Golden Immortals bear alms of dew*—
**Zhenren of Shan Mountain**,
Enjoying the rustic village’s winds and moons, trusting the years to pass in exchange.

All day, sheltering behind the thatched gate,
In quiet chambers, idly browsing ancient texts with languid ease.
Sitting with composure, walking alone—
Sever all ties to fame and name.

Embrace the primordial yang,
Forget the world, dissolve in stillness,
Qi and spirit harmonized—
Ascend and descend without hindrance,
Refine the elixir to its purest treasure,
Cultivate serenity, gentle rebirth.
Silent and unassuming, returning to the source,
Nurture the true essence, restore the uncarved.

Still and clear, tame the restless mind—
No more disturbance from thoughts like wild monkeys.
Free and unrestrained, indulge in boundless joy.
At ease and unshackled,
When deeds are fulfilled and virtue complete,
Attain the state of no-birth—
Let the world’s affairs rush by,
Unconcerned with their rise and fall.
The world’s passions grow distant.

Seekers of the Dao must not delay.
Sweet dew falls on lofty pines,
Time flees swift—
Alas, mortals day by day,
Cling to life without end.

If wealth surpasses Shi Chong’s stone,
Gold and jade piled high,
What gain is there but boundless karma?
Daily deceit and falsehood weigh upon the heart.
Even the Lord of Hell calls—
Your past sins await,
Who will answer for you?

Better to cultivate early,
Join the Daoist immortals beyond the world,
Cast off the mundane.

Silent and profound,
Another realm unfolds—
The boundless expanse of the *Cauldron*’s world.
Manifesting all beings,
Moonlight shines bright—
Behold the Dharma-realm, spirit and light as one.
Return, and the Clear Wind escorts you to the Celestial Emperor.

*Raindrops fall*—
**Song Pi Yun**, high mountains and flowing waters.
Ah, how few are the true kindred in this world—
South of the Zhongnan Range, mist and clouds stretch ten thousand li.
Return, for the years grow old.
Staff, elixir, and scrolls—
Beyond these, what baggage do you carry?
Delight in simplicity, uphold the family Dao of purity,
A single luminous spirit-mirror, clear as washed.

Within its marvels, the teacher points the way—
Strive to banish the specter of impermanence.
Sheathe the three-foot spirit-sword,
Thunderous strikes—
The Fire Dragon takes flight.

When the world knows peace,
Between the white clouds,
Laugh and roam at will.
The worldly seekers of fame and gain,
Do not understand enduring life—
Chasing through the dusty red world.

**Second Poem**
*Seven-petal golden lotus*—
The Gan River’s depths, casually pierced.
Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Sun, and Wang,
Hao Taigu and Xu Lai—
Two true companions wrapped in coarse mats,
Leak not a drop of time,
The teacher’s cause and effect revealed.

Blooming lotus petals,
Ten thousand flowers in unison,
Fragrant mist fills the world—
*Celestial blessings seal it.*
The Jiazi year passes not in vain,
Now the Daoist immortals and heavenly beings rejoice in your awakening.

The *Quanzhen*’s household is profound,
Indeed, within it—
One must forget self and others.
Branches split nineteenfold,
Dwelling on the Dan Platform,
Surname, title, and name all spread.
Deeds and practice lack not a thread,
Yet the upper realms admit me not.

*Playing on the Jade Terrace*—
**Feng Zunshi**,
Directly pointing to the *Xuan Yuan* Path.
Alas, the *苦海*’s delusion blinds mortals.
Before you, smooth and steady,
No peril or obstacle to hinder.

Cast aside all worldly ties—
Awakening arises on its own.
Like cranes breaking free from clouds,
Toward the boundless Daoist skies, stride with faith.
Celebrate the immortal companions.
When thirsty, drink ambrosial peaches,
Fermented in sweet wine.
Entering and exiting star pavilions and moon halls,
Laugh at the world’s birth and death, past and future.

Riding the auspicious phoenix and blessed crane,
Ascend to the *Tai Pei*’s void—
Return to repose in the depths of *Bi Xia*.
This untrammled life is hard to share—
Entrust it to the Penglai companions.

**Third Poem: Ode to Tea**
*One breath exchanged*—
A thunderous shake, one sound—
The yellow sprout emerges.
The *Jade Maiden* picks it,
Seals it in the cauldron,
Refines it without flaw.

The iron wheel turns ten thousand times,
The tea leaves tremble—
A thousand infusions reveal no end.
Like the *Dharma’s* use,
The craft perfected—
Savor it in every moment.

Worthy of praise—
The Daoist child’s skill,
Floating tea leaves like spring snow, beyond compare.
Banish the sleep demon,
Sever the path of the Way,
Expose the superficial.

*Zhaozhou* knows its taste,
*Lu Quan* reaches this truth—
All lead to the immortal realm.
This tea cup—
May all awaken early,
Together bound for mist and clouds.

**Fourth Poem: Yellow Root Dream**
*Yellow Root*—
The dream dissolves.

**First Poem:**

Banish the fleeting vanities before your eyes—
Reflect fiercely, break free from the mundane cage.
Beyond the world, what chains remain?
Follow the *Zhen*’s shadow, befriend the *Xia*’s glow,
Roam where winds are neighbors, moons your companions.
The carefree wanderer—
Bound by no rule.
Skimming green waters, savoring blue mountains,
Dissolving into ease.

Such joy—
No gold could trade.
Let others scramble for fame, wealth, and power.
But I seek only a leftward turn—
Living on simple fare,
Claiming all of life’s languid ease.

Morning to evening, a pillow of deep slumber,
Stretching limbs in boundless ease.
Within the red dust—
Observe well:
Who matches my leisure?
Worthy of envy.

In this idle state, there lies another art—
The *Cloud-Holding* technique.

---

**Second Poem: [Qiu Changchun] #3**
A life of indolence—
Only earning a pillow of carefree repose.
Wild-haired, filthy-faced,
Unmoved by the body’s decay.
Let the *San Guang* rush by—
Sun, moon, and stars—
While the *Four Great Elements* bear the weight of forests and streams.

By the deep ravine, beside the secluded cliff,
Mountains hide, clouds seal the path.
Disaster?
Thunder crashes, lightning strikes—
Yet none dare near me.

At noon, I rise and wander, then sit again.
Shatter every old habit.
In leisure’s embrace, only this remains:
Tired of greed, content in poverty,
Desire severed, drowsy in the smoke of life.
No stored grain, no elixir sold.
Singing with ease, laughing without restraint—
Worthy indeed.

---

**Qiu Changchun #4**
A lone wanderer, stumbling along,
Crosses the Qin Basin—westward into the land of Panshu’s winding streams.
By empty valleys, cliffs, and secluded ravines,
A lofty cave in the clouds shelters his trace.

Smoke and flame are nonexistent,
No provisions stored—what need has he ever amassed?
Hunger met, thirst quenched,
He seeks sustenance in village lanes and byways at each passing hour.
Whatever scraps of cold or hot remain,
Filling his belly, stuffing his gut,
No need for true *cultivation*’s force.

Liking and disliking come and go—just enough to keep him alive,
Avoiding the labor of kitchen and hearth.
His *skin-bag*#5 is mere guise,
As incense fills his *passages*#6—
Seeking only to augment his *vital essence* and *qi*.

His physical form is light and nimble,
His *Dharma-body*#7 rests with ease.

---

**Qiu Changchun #5**
In the thatched hut, we sit together,
Let the *Pure-Void*#8 and cold detachment
Stir the heart’s incense—warm as ever.
He knows the *Primordial True Face*—
All *dharma* dissolves into the same.

Walking like idle clouds,
Sitting as empty valleys,
Motion and stillness both rest.

The *Mystic Profound*’s subtlety—
Indeed, it cannot be split open with words.
Gazing upward, the heights are boundless,
Peering ahead, it vanishes in an instant—
A single point, never lacking.

Whether speech or silence,
All—*immortals*, *sages*, *Buddhas*—
Share its perfect harmony.
*Chan* and *Dao* alike:
Void, still, and utterly extinguished.

Filling every measure, yet forgotten,
Swelling the earth, yet unnoticed—
Wrapped in *Round Perfection*#9, clear and complete.
The *Mystic Sky* reveals itself alone—
A wheel of formless *heart-moon*#10.

---

**Qiu Changchun #6**
Delving into the *Mystic Profound* with toil,
Forcing through the *Dao-law*’s iron firmament.
Cawing crows, howling monkeys—
All speak of the *Non-Dual*#11.
Yet beware of clinging to their divisions.

A single shout—*heart* is illuminated,
A staff’s strike—*nature* is seen.
This truth is fixed, yet hard to say.

The knots of doubt are shattered,
The original face is light—its secrets spill.
Flowers bloom on rootless trees,
Pulsing through ages, ancient and new,
Falling away, returning to the *kalpa*#12.

Wiping the *brush* with tortoise-shell,
Rinsing the *mouth* with spring’s flow—
Long-tongued as the *stone-washing*#13.
Five schools of *dharma*, six lineages of *patriarchal intent*#14,
Yet all erect a waist-high snowdrift—
A hollow display.

Let me liken it to this:
A jade pool, cold, steeped in autumn’s moon.
---

**Manting Huang** #15
*Sinking into the Void*, yet clinging to stillness,
The fool wastes his labor in vain.
Grinding bricks to make a mirror,
Seeking fish by climbing trees.
Why point at the moon when it’s seen?
To gaze upon flowers—
All is *Suchness*#16.

The wise discern things as they arise,
Neither vexed nor pleased.
As *immortal* or *Buddha*—
No gain, no loss,
Neither real nor unreal.

Radiant, open—
A single *divine pearl*#17.
Mingling with the vulgar, yet never stained,
Amid the crowd—
*Dharma* and dust cannot bind him.

The *Everlasting Use*#18 knows no limits—
Stable, vast, and boundless.
What is not *Void* and *Nothingness*?

---

**Zui Jiangyu** #19
*Huangfu the True Person*#20
Pierces the *Chaos*#21—
Behold! The *Qingbi*#22
Southward, the Yangtze’s jade-like grip.

From ancient to modern, poets have sought its scenes—
Who understands its *original source*?

The years pass, one *Geng* month follows another *Jia*—
Why does it show no difference?
Now I reveal the *key*—
To know the origins of heaven and earth.

The *Dao* has a name that may be spoken—
The *Five Phases*#23 shift, overturning,
Arranging the *Heavenly Horse*#24 and *Earthly Tiger*#25’s strategies.

*Kan* water flows backward to the *Bing* door#26,
Following the moon’s waxing and waning, ebbing and swelling.
At *Mid-Autumn*, when *qi* arrives,
Metal can birth water—
Snow surges in layers a thousandfold.
The *immortals’* wondrous workings
Are no different from the tides.

---

**Shui Diao Ge Tou** #27
*Xu Jing, the Heavenly Master*#28
Holds the *secret keys* of the *Highest Truth*#29,
Guides the learned to rescue the lost.
A pure heart, a spotless path—
All *heavenly beings*, *saints*, and *common folk* seek refuge here.
Not in *soaring through the Pole Star* or *treading the Dipper*#30,
Not in *broad hearing* or *much learning*—
A chaotic mind only breeds doubt.

Only banish deceit and falsehood,
Let the heart align with the *divine*#31.
Awaken to the *True Void*#32,
Break free from the world’s snare,
Sever the *passages*#33.

Nurture vast *qi*#34,
Commanding thunder, subduing lightning—
Rescuing the world from peril.
Merge with all *spirits*, returning to the One,
A single thought pierces heaven and earth—
Only then does *non-doing*#35 begin.

With a shout, winds and rains arise,
Upholding the world, aiding the *rightful age*#36.

---
**#2**
No need to hunt for *divine waters*#37,
Nor ask of the *Pool of Flowers*#38.
Yellow sprouts, white snow—
All are but false names.
Just these *Heavenly Ox* and *Earthly Horse*#39,
Are the *High Dragon* and *Kan Tiger*#40—
No need for further guesswork.

Medicines weigh no *jin* or *liang*#41,
*Fire-alchemy*#42 need not be timed.

**偃月炉，朱砂鼎，总皆非。**
The crescent furnace, the cinnabar cauldron—all in vain.

**真铅真汞，遇之不炼要何为。**
True lead and true mercury—if they meet unrefined, what purpose is there?

**自己金翁姹女，渐渐打成一块，胎息象婴儿。**
The Golden Uncle and Crimson Maiden, fused together—
Breathing as one, like an infant in the womb.

**不信张平叔，你更问他谁。**
Do not trust Zhang Ping-shu—who else would you ask?

---

**其三#9**
*(Attributed to Bai Yu-xian)*

**东风卷帘模，时物又新奇。**
The east wind lifts the curtain—spring’s wonders anew.

**桃花院落，小桥流水柳依依。**
Peach blossoms in the courtyard, willows clinging to the bridge,
Where streams flow softly beneath.

**正是清明天气，芳草池塘鲜丽，何处不相宜。**
At Qingming’s gentle season, fragrant grasses brighten the ponds—
Wherever one lingers, all is fitting.

**紫燕添新垒，小雨洒芳菲。**
Swallows build their nests in purple hues,
While fine rain scatters blossoms’ splendor.

**老生涯，沽酒杖，钓鱼矶。**
In my old age, I drink wine with a staff,
Or fish from the rocks where the river bends.

**江湖一样，几声鸥鹭夕阳微。**
Lakes and rivers alike—
A few cries of herons as the sun sinks low.

**百岁光阴石火，万迭云山烟锁，回首顿忘机。**
A hundred years pass like flint and fire,
Endless peaks shrouded in mist—
Turning back, all worldly schemes dissolve.

**蝶梦松窗下，高卧碧云蹊。**
Butterfly dreams beneath the pine window,
Slumbering deep in the path of azure clouds.

---

**孤鹰**
*(Ma Dan-yang)*

**苦海为人，随波逐浪，茫茫甚日休期。**
As a man in the bitter sea, tossed by waves,
When will this endless drifting cease?

**为酒色财气，一向粘惹，瞒心昧己。**
For wine and lust, wealth and arrogance—
Clinging like stains, deceiving the heart and self.

**不算前程，幻躯有限，待作千年之计。**
No reckoning of fate—this mortal form is fleeting,
Yet men scheme for millennia ahead.

**忽一朝阴公来请，看你教谁替。**
Suddenly, the Dark Lord summons—
Who then will you send in your place?

**千间峻宇，金玉满堂，毕竟成何济。**
A thousand rooms of towering halls,
Gold and jade piled high—
What good does it all bring in the end?

**劝诸公省，早把凡笼猛跳出。**
I urge you, gentlemen, to wake—
Break free from the cage of mundane desires!

**向物外飘蓬，放落魄婪耽，鹑居鷇食，昏昏炼己。**
Beyond the world’s clamor, like a drifting leaf,
Cast off greed and folly—
Live like the quail in its nest, eating plain fare,
Refining the self in quietude.

**默默地、怡神养气，丹成既济。**
Silently, nurturing spirit and *qi*,
The elixir perfected—all is fulfilled.

**乘彩云，跨凤归。**
Riding the rainbow clouds, mounting the phoenix—
Returning home.

---

**集贤宾**
*(Wang Chong-chang)*

**仔细曾穷究，想六地众生，强揽闲愁。**
Carefully examining, I see the six realms’ beings—
How they force upon themselves idle sorrows.

**恰才得食饱，又思量、骏马轻裘。**
Scarcely sated, they already scheme for
Fine horses and light furs.

**有骏马，有轻裘，又思量、建节封侯。**
With swift steeds and warm cloaks,
They dream of banners and noble titles.

**假若金银过北斗，置下万顷良田，盖起百尺高楼。**
If gold and silver fill the Dipper’s measure,
If they own vast fields and towering halls—
What then?

**儿孙自有儿孙福，莫与儿孙作马牛。**
Their children will have their own fortunes—
Do not become their ox or horse.

**贪利禄，竞虚名，惹机勾。**
Greed for gain and hollow fame
Stirs the snares of fate.

**岂知身似，水上浮沤。**
Do they not see their bodies as
Floating reeds on the water?

**贪恋气财并酒色，不肯上、钓鱼舟。**
Clinging to *qi*, wealth, wine, and lust,
They refuse to board the fishing boat—
The path to true liberation.

**荒尽丹田三顷，荆棘多稠。**
The *elixir field* lies waste, overgrown with thorns.

**宝藏库、偷盗了明珠，铁灯盏、渗漏了清油。**
The treasure vault is plundered of its pearls,
The iron lamp leaks its pure oil.

**水银迸散难再收，大丹砂甚日成就。**
Mercury scatters, never to be gathered—
When will the Great Elixir be complete?

**杀曾叮咛劝，劝着后，几曾偢。**
Though warnings are whispered again and again,
How few heed them!

**苦海深，波浪流。**
The bitter sea runs deep, its waves endless.

**心闲无事却垂钩。**
With a tranquil heart, the fishing line is cast—
No need for haste.

**呜呼锦鳞终不省，摇头摆尾，恣纵来，来往戏波流。**
Alas, the scaled treasures never awaken—
Shaking their heads, they frolic in the waves,
Unwilling to be caught.

**愚迷子，省贪求。**
Foolish and lost, they cling to desire—
All for a needle’s worth of fame and gain,
While youth fades unnoticed.

---

**齐天乐**
*(Qiu Chang-chun)*

**自离东海上，元本三州，四人同契。**
Since leaving the Eastern Sea,
The Four Worthies of Shu—
Bound by the same Dao.

**异域殊乡，同行并坐，终日相将游戏。**
Though lands and homes were distant,
We walked and sat together,
Playing and conversing all day.

**谈玄论妙，究方外之清闲，道家真味。**
Discussing the Mysterious and the Marvelous,
Probing the leisure of the *outer world*,
Tasting the true essence of the Dao.

The Master’s teachings—
What difference is there in affection?

Now separated by vast distances,
With steadfast resolve and diligent hearts,
Each refines himself, fleeing the world’s decline.

Though scattered like fallen leaves,
Gatherings are rare—
Remote peaks and passes stretch endlessly.

Heaven and Earth divide us,
Like scattered stars at dawn—
Distant, yet visible.

**再遇何年，驾云朝上帝。**
When next we meet, in what year?
Riding the clouds to pay homage to the Celestial.

---

**其二**
**自清都别后，来人间梦中游戏。**
Since parting from Qingdu,
I wander in the world as in a dream.

**性本玄虚，君临社稷，洪福齐天康济。**
By nature, I am boundless and void,
Yet rule the realm with boundless virtue—
My blessings match Heaven’s, bringing peace.

**冬温夏清，任春水秋山，放怀如意。**
In winter, warmth; in summer, cool—
Spring waters and autumn mountains at my will,
My heart unbound.

**外物多情，幻身无奈生憔悴。**
Though the world is full of allure,
This mortal form grows weary in vain.

**深穷仙方道术，固炼形神，内观返调元气。**
I delve deeply into immortal arts,
Cultivating body and spirit,
Turning *qi* inward, restoring its roots.

**四大冲和，三彭遁匿，熟境繁华何忌。**
The Four Elements harmonize,
The Three *Peng*s retreat—
What need to fear the world’s luxuries?

**真空妙有，况千古灵明，自然凋弊。**
True Void, wondrous existence—
How much more so the ancient *Ling-ming*,
Which fades of its own accord.

**梦觉心开，廓然超万岁。**
Awakening from the dream, the heart expands—
Transcending ten thousand years.

---

**永遇乐**
**试问诸公，本来模样，如何形状。**
Gentlemen, let me ask—
What is your original form?
How does it appear?

**纵使丹青，难描这个，旷劫端严相。**
Even the finest brushes cannot capture it—
Its grandeur spans eons.

**无形无影，观之不见，听之又无响。**
Formless, shadowless—
You cannot see it, nor hear its sound.

**露堂堂、不摇不动，目前甚是明朗。**
Yet it stands revealed, unmoving, unshaken—
Bright as day before you.

**人还省悟，回光返照，莫向外边劳攘。**
If only men would awaken,
Turning inward like the sun’s last light—
Do not toil beyond!

**放下诸缘，屏除万事，物物离心上。**
Cast aside all attachments,
Set aside all worldly affairs—
Let all things drift free from the mind.

**迷云消散，性天独露，心月永无遮障。**
The clouds of delusion disperse,
Revealing the true nature—
The heart’s moon, unobstructed forever.

**与三界、一切诸仙，并无两样。**
It shares no difference with the Three Realms,
Or all the immortals.

---

**其二**
**行也无忧，坐也无闷，长安长乐。**
Walking brings no worry, sitting no restlessness—
Eternal peace in Chang’an.

**息息绵绵，朝朝暮暮，保养神珠一颗。**
Breath by breath, day by day,
Nurturing the precious *shen-zhu* within.

**闲是闲非，莫偢莫采，大忌竞争人我。**
Leisure is not leisure—
Do not strive, do not grasp—
The greatest taboo is competing with others.

**灭无明、心似寒灰，便是道人功果。**
Extinguish ignorance—
The heart like cold ashes—
This is the Daoist’s reward.

**猿儿不走，马儿捉住，龙虎定中交媾。**
The monkey does not flee,
The horse is caught—
The union of Dragon and Tiger is sealed.

**阳降阴升，日来月往，炉炼长生药。**
Yang descends, Yin ascends,
Sun and moon pass—
The furnace refines the elixir of longevity.

**抽添鼎内，不须炊爨，自有九阳真火。**
Stirring within the cauldron,
No need for stoking—
The Nine Suns’ true fire burns on its own.

**霜心子、明把天机，与君说破。**
Frosted Heart—
I reveal the Heavenly Mystery to you.

---

**宣静三台**
*(Niu Zhen-ren)*

**自小飘蓬，身心落魄，云游多在山东。**
From youth, a drifting leaf,
Body and heart adrift—
Mostly wandering in Shandong’s mountains.

**世间事，看破浑是假想，荣华犹似梦中。**
The world’s affairs—
All illusions, seen through—
Glory and splendor like a fleeting dream.

**盖个庵儿，隈山靠水，栽松种竹成林。**
I built a humble hut,
Nestled by mountains and water,
Planting pines and bamboo until the grove was thick.

**炕暖窗明，乐清闲、胜竞利名。**
The kang is warm, the windows bright—
Joy in quietude surpasses striving for fame.

**月朗山东，凉风细细，南溪绿水邻邻。**
Under the bright moon in Shandong,
Cool breezes whisper,
Beside the green waters of Nanxi.

**Gradual Refinement**

As the elixir is refined,
The heart’s core grows cold as ash—
Yet one *yang* stirs,
The jade cauldron warms itself.

Ethereal *qi* swirls thick,
Celestial blossoms bloom in splendor,
Fragrance fills the Yellow Court.

Jade Maidens and Golden Boys
Gather them—
Forging the Purple Gold.

Circulating the Three Passes,
Driving back the Four Symbols,
Harmonizing the One Essence of Clarity.

*Qi* condenses, spirit congeals—
Listen to the *sheng* and *xiao*,
A symphony of pure sound.

Fated bonds from past lives,
Encountering the True Teaching now—
The profound, perfect Dao.

Merit fulfilled, the work complete,
Riding *luan* and *he* to the Supreme Clarity.

---
**Ode to Wuyi (No. 11)**
*Bai Yuzhen*

In days of old, at Qin’s time,
On a Mid-Autumn night in Wuyi’s Nine Bends—
Silent mist,
Slanted sun, mere spans in height,
Crows perched on withered branches.

Thirty-six peaks stand in morning verdure,
One stream’s flow births autumn’s green.
Just as the groves fill with cassia’s scent,
Golden millet scatters from the sky.

Divine guests arrive—
The Golden Elixir ripens.
A jade edict descends,
Clouds form beneath my feet.
New bones knit in stone,
Yet still cling to red flesh.

Midnight’s moon shines bright as day,
The Jade Emperor’s palanquin arrives, feasts spread.
Laughing, I recall the pavilion’s past—
Now only pines and bamboo remain.

---
**Ode to the White Lotus**

Last night, Chang’e wandered,
Drunk from the Celestial Palace’s halls.
Why did she drop her jade hairpin?
The Water Spirit stays silent.

She took it to the Crystal Palace—
At dawn, it was returned, chattering.
The wind blew it into fragrant skies—
Who could distinguish?

Soft yet moist,
Cool and pure.
White as jade,
Cold as snow.
Even the Jade Emperor’s gardens
Lack such a bloom.

Only poetry can praise it—
Let none dare pluck or break it.
Laughing at Li’s coarse lotus,
Thin as a willow—
This one surpasses all.

---
**Ten Thousand Springs**
*Qiu Changchun*

Sleeves, autumn’s cloak—
Wearing them now feels just right.
Frost-clear skies.
Unfettered joy in wandering,
No fear of the west wind’s might.

Hundreds of petals, thousands of threads,
Strung together with precision.
Loose yet bound.
Wildness without, inner pearls gleaming.

---
**Playful Leisure**

The moon at heaven’s edge,
At first like a bow.
Now vanished in the *geng* earth.
Dragons seek tigers,
Tigers seek dragons—
They meet.
A golden flower blooms in the wind.

The moon at heaven’s edge,
Now like an overturned furnace.
Lead and mercury dwell in the alchemical tripod.
Fire must refine,
Melting the flowing pearl.
One gourd—
Three hundred eighty-four *zhu*.

---
**Pearl Curtain**
*Bai Yuzhen*

*Yin* and *yang* internally unite,
Lead and mercury arrayed in the Eight Trigrams.
The Golden Cauldron refines the Yellow Sprout,
At the hour when *yang* first ascends.
After the Hour of Child, before noon—
Fire enters the jade furnace,
Boiling into white snow.

Piercing clarity.
This Mysterious Pass is profound—
Not lightly revealed.

**Following the Master’s Subtle Instructions**

Seizing the essence of Tiger and Dragon,
The sun and moon arise naturally.
Heaven’s creative art—how could mortals fathom?
Exchanging mortal bones,
Forever free from demonic snares.

Transcending.

Gazing toward the Celestial Capital’s gate,
Bowing at the Golden Palace of the Primordial.
Drunk on fragrant wine from youthful lone clouds,
Beyond all worldly ties.
Wearing one patch,
Stitching another—
The joy of unbounded ease.

A broken gourd at the waist,
No other baggage.
Others mock me for my lack of care.
Let them point and scold.
In ancient temples and shrines,
I play with mud gods instead.

A cracked sand basin,
A shattered clay pot,
A spoon bent beyond use.
A torn paper quilt,
A mended sack,
Curled up to sleep.

Only waiting—
When my merit is complete, I’ll ascend to the Jade Emperor.
Then shall I prove myself a true man of resolve.

**Gazing at Penglai**
*Qiu Changchun*

Hear my counsel, for small matters you must know:
All striving brings harm in the end—
Profit gained is profit lost.
Cleverness is not as good as simplicity.

True cultivation lies beyond the mind’s grasp.
See only what is before you,
And troubles will not follow.
Step by step, enter the realm of Non-Action.

**Four Pieces of Jade**

Life’s swift as a shuttle, so turn back soon to seek your livelihood.
Do not let gain ensnare you, nor fame drag you—
Let not wine and lust cloud your senses.

Right and wrong, others and I—
Why stir the idle *qi*?

When lead is spent and mercury exhausted,
Then will you rue your hidden treasures—
In vain you’ll weep and wail.

From this day forth, take action now,
Better early than delayed.

Be simple, be foolish—
Profit will come to you naturally.

Even if you feed a thousand mouths at home,
What good does it bring?
In vain you labor body and mind,
Day and night without rest,
Wasting your youthful bloom,
Leaving you gaunt and weary.

Why endure this suffering?
Why not look back and reflect:
Count your own blessings—
Who can replace the impermanence?

**#1**
*By Master Feng Zun*
After the meal, leisurely pacing,
A staff in hand—what support for wild gazing?
Sails return to distant harbors,
Herons stand on riverbanks,
A thousand trees in blossom, softly unfurled.
Fragrant grasses by the pond,
Jade River towers—
Misty clouds conceal the green barriers.
Gazing eastward to the horizon’s end,
No old friends—only melancholy.
Returning homeward, the emerald ridges steep,
Forests and peaks in shadowed embrace,
To while away the evening’s restless mood.
Clever birds in whispered song,
Willows droop like golden threads,
Green shadows echo on the bridge’s span.
Sweeping away serpentine cares,
Savoring the breeze and light—
Like Tao Qian and Xie Lingyun in verse and brush.
What fine scenes these mountains hold,
Beyond the world’s dust—
How few can truly seek them.

**#2**
The sun’s last glow returns,
An end to mortal toil—
Where now shall I rest my weight?
Withered fields of Zheng,
Bamboo groves and pine streams,
Where hidden joys and pleasures dwell.
Cloud-friends and mist-companions,
Water’s hue, mountains’ grace—
Secluded in smoke-wreathed crags and valleys.
Yet here, my spirit soars beyond the sky,
A single breath of boundless vastness.
Worthy of love:
Butterflies dance on blossoming branches,
Moss creeps on stone paths,
Soft winds lift the curtains—daylight high.
With serene breadth of mind,
Chewing the cosmos’ essence,
Lofty above the world’s clamor and feasts.
Loose robes, wide sleeves,
Pale jade dangling—
Laughing, I recline by the eastern hedge, sipping wine.
I would write my true feelings,
Yet dusty paths and absent friends
Leave only desolation.

**#3**
Piercing the world’s delusion,
Free of mortal snares—
Drifting, unbound, no chains to hold.
Floating like water-plants,
Refined in solitude, proud as wild deer,
Like clouds and deer in untamed lands.
Riding waves when struck by fate,
Blending with the world’s light—
What honor or shame in knowing when to stop?
Let the tides of life surge on,
Heedless of youth’s fleeting rush.
From now on, ink and brush gather dust,
Worldly thoughts dissolve—
Content in emerald clouds’ high halls.
All things released,
All cares abandoned—
Quiet before my study’s plum and bamboo.
Pure laziness, ancient virtue’s wind,
Is the true, eternal bliss.
Let the crowd’s frenzy—
Day and night, racing through the world’s paths,
Clashing like wild beasts—
Pass me by.

**#4**
Dreaming of the Hall of Huai,
Leaning against heaven’s heights, a long cry—
Piercing through the world’s illusions, past and present.
Carrying twin mirrors bright as snow,
Hunting tigers, slaying dragons—
Once, I wasted my youth in such folly.
Jin Valley’s splendor,
Han gardens, Qin palaces—
Only fallen petals and drifting silk remain.
Ah, mortal life—
Busy all day, who pauses to reflect before death?
Better than this:
Pure talk with jade dust,
Golden zithers’ refined play—
Sleeping high in the caverns’ threshold.
Roaming fields at ease,
Freeing my heart’s wild flight,
Leisurely with lapwing and heron by the marsh.
Gathering my life anew,
Purple crabs, golden oranges—
A single raincoat on the misty river.
Drunk, I return as always,
To the deep reeds’ embrace,
Moonlight on the quiet shore.

**#5**
Ask the Zen gates—
Endless seeking, often empty at the end.
Grinding bricks to make a mirror,
Piling snow for beams—
How many youths have wandered lost?
Swallowing mountains,
Nestling mustard seeds—
Laughing gold-headed adepts.
When enlightened, transcending the Ten Bhūmis,
Free from doubt in the Four Births and Six Paths.
Who hears the cuckoo’s cry at dawn
Before the cliff’s silent rocks,
Beneath the shade-less tree?
The path to Caoxi is steep,
The Eagle’s Ridge shrouded in clouds—
No trace of old friends here.
A thousand-foot ice cliff,
Five-petaled lotuses bloom,
Ancient halls’ scented curtains sway.
Avoiding the brambles’ tangle,
Old wives and wandering sons—
Dream and reality blur.

**#6**
To transcend and attain the True,
Steel your resolve—
Awaken wisdom suddenly.
Dust dispelled, thoughts still,
Love abandoned, sorrow forgotten—
Tranquil ease knows its own sweetness.
A thunderclap—
Fire ignites the Three Fields,
Midnight crows fly a thousand *li*.
Through the curtains, the furnace glows warm,
Drinking elixir’s rich, fragrant nectar.
Now skilled in hand:
Riding phoenixes, mounting cranes,
Forging gold, refining wood—
Reveling in the caverns’ marvels.
Radiant light, pure essence,
Filling sea and mountain—
True *qi* permeates heaven and earth.
Striding on wind and cloud,
Mounting sun and moon,
No child’s play, this mastery.
Gathering the Mystic Pearl,
Returning to the Great Void—
Saints and sages share this realm.

**#7**
The Dao is profound and hidden—
How can its signs be known?
Speak of it, and even ghosts and gods recoil in dread.

It embraces the cosmos,
Splits the Mysterious Origin,
True joy in the world has no equal.

Before the Spirit Vulture Peak,
A treasure pearl is plucked forth—
Five radiant hues shine clear.

Illuminating heaven and earth,
All beings above and below—
The wise live as long as mountains and seas.

At its utmost height,
Emerald mists dissolve lightly,
Jade flowers fall in disarray,
An empty void weaves into a canopy.

Golden body, jade bones,
Moonly veil, starry crown,
In harmony with crystal and celestial resonance.

Pure and serene abode,
Saints and sages’ bearing—
Through ages, their presence remains.

May those who seek
Grasp this subtle, rare truth,
Together wander beyond the square.

---

**#8**
To avoid the world and dwell in peace,
Mingle with dust yet stay aligned,
Silent depths—who can know the sage?

Dwelling like quails, eating like sparrows,
Moss paths, vine-lined caves,
Nurturing virtue in profound stillness.

Floating stillness has its place,
Emerging and retreating without measure,
Divine responsiveness defies prediction.

Delight in gourd and bowl,
Laugh in scorn of groves and springs,
Yet refuse to bow to servitude.

At this moment,
Pine chairs, bamboo halls—
Lips hum, tongue plucks,
Drinking spring wine from jade cups.

A chestful of moonlight,
Two sleeves of clean wind—
Truly, this is the hidden truth.

The life beyond the square,
Meaning in stillness,
Not to be casually plucked.

Wait for the mist to disperse,
The jade cord to rise pure—
Then know the truth itself.

---

**#9**
Ah, the masses’ delusion,
Lost in the ford’s twists,
When will their drifting cease?

Striving for supremacy,
Clinging to life in vain,
Ever bound to home and gain.

Chains of profit, reins of fame,
Waves of desire, mountains of favor,
Drunk in the wine markets, stumbling through flower-lined streets.

Like ants in endless cycles,
They forget their hair turns white.
Who would choose the Great Simplicity’s grove,
The land of Non-Action,
To idle with Laozi and Zhuangzi?

Pearls lost, elephants trapped in nets,
Dreaming shattered in Hua Xu,
High-pillowed in the celestial caverns of day and moon.

The Three Realms vanish,
The Eight Directions dissolve into emptiness—
Piercing, luminous light shines through.

This effortless freedom beyond kalpas,
Ah, true joy—
Words cannot say it.

---

**#10**
Time flees like a crack in a wheel,
Like dust motes—
Silently shifting all things.

The floating life is restless,
Awareness lost in dust,
Entangled by wine, desire, profit, fame.

Look, through the ages,
Heroes of Chu, Yue, Zhou, Qin, Tang, Han—
Only crumbling graves and ruined steles remain,
Endless strife through the ages.

Yet those who awaken early
Find in the jade cup’s blue-green depths,
White clouds piled—
Another palace of emerald mists.

The Three Heavens’ gathering,
Five-colored lights converge,
Morning attendance at the jade banquet of Purple Micro.

The Celestial Gardens, the Jade Pool,
The Vermilion Gate, the Pure Capital—
Truly, this is effortless wandering.

Laughing at the foolish,
Trapped in the苦海, selling bones without end,
Endlessly turning.

---

**#11**
Awakened at Caoqi,
Cranes soar into the celestial void,
Cloud-water monks’ livelihood.

By the river, raising the oar,
Facing the scene, casting the hook—
Red carp leap from the brocade waves.

Wind carries the fishing boat,
Piercing twin peaks,
Shadows wrapped—startled clarity after rain.

Seeing mist and clouds,
Gazing at the elixir’s gold—
One grain surpasses all treasures.

In its mystery,
The Great One contains the True,
The Mysterious Origin forms its image,
Ascending and descending without obstruction.

Nine years of resolve,
Three years of will,
Five flowers of jade nectar refined.

All from the numinous source,
Piercing the Nine Lights,
The true realm revealed beyond compare.

This eternal life, prolonged vision,
Heaven’s profound mechanism,
The true logic of immortals.

---

**#12**
Establishing the numinous altar,
First refining the elixir furnace,
Nurturing the True Vitality of Great Harmony.

Wind howls, tigers roar,
Fire rises, dragons ascend—
Harmonizing depends on the seasons.

Metal and wood converge,
The Dipper’s axis aligns with Heaven’s Gate,
Swirling to purge the heart’s path.

Witness the Mystic Pearl—
A grain of flowing wine,
Flickering back into the golden cauldron.

The cauldron’s scene—
Creation’s subtle mystery,
Essential patterns must be refined,
Crafting the spirit’s essence, the soul’s sanctity.

From nothingness to function,
From principle to truth—
Awakening to the original nature.

Returning to boundlessness,
Gradually entering Green Yang,
The仙境 fills the void with stillness.

This wheel of moonlight,
A century of obscurity—
Suddenly clear and bright.

---

**#13**
Cultivating qi to swallow the clouds,
Riding the wind to drink the dew—
Align with the Five Phases’ order.

The southern mountain’s crimson phoenix,
The northern sea’s black tortoise—
Steady resolve, focused heart, seek it.

Lead and mercury meet,
In the crucible of creation,
Forging one perfect pill.

Following Yin and Yang’s divine use,
Nurturing the boundless true breath.

At the Mystic Pass’s awakening,
Only now do the blind and deaf see—
Encountering the sage who opens the way.

Using talismans of wondrous Dao,
Silently moving subtle patterns,
Jade nectar flows, increasing.

Cloud-water leisure,
The Great Void’s emptiness—
Vastness has no trace.

This elixir’s secret,
A lifetime’s doubt—
Now dissolved like ice.

---

**#14**
Sun and moon race high,
Golden waves surge—
Seven returns, nine circulations extend life.

True essence responds to things,
The Dao hides its body,
Mysteriously penetrating the path.

Only when Yang arises,
Does creation’s elixir form—
Dragon and Tiger ascend to Purple Void’s heaven.

This jade case,
Celestial seals of fate—
Must be opened by the sage.

The Way of longevity,
Deep-rooted and firm,
The immortals’ craft—
Refining lead and mercury as their duty.

The furnace glows with five colors,
The cauldron radiates the Three Lights—
Recognize the original True Ancestor.

Before the Moonlit Pavilion,
A golden cicada appears,
Dancing on emerald peaks in bright space.

With a lofty resolve,
Sincere cultivation,
The immortal’s examination.

---

**#15**
Original qi fills the cauldron,
Ragged robes conceal the body—
What use are all worldly matters?

Yellow sprouts, white snow,
Black waters, red clouds—
The Yellow Emperor’s transmission is renowned.

Deep thanks to the clear teacher,
Who reveals the subtle mystery—
Profound truths are pure and refined.

Nurturing the仙胎 into a cloudy orb,
Enveloping all spirits completely.

Holding creation’s work,
Each is perfected,
All possess sufficiency—
One breath returns to primordial essence.

「Ranging through the Eight Boundaries,
Wandering in praise of the Three Mountains,
Never straying far—all within arm’s reach.

Lamentable are those lost in error,
How could they know the interplay of Yin and Yang?
The True Ancestor’s teachings are left to false demons.

Refining the Golden Elixir—
All are born of Heaven and Earth’s finest,
Vying in bold and boundless *qi*.

---
**Sixteen**
Withdrawing from grains, halting the kitchen,
Feasting on mist and drinking dew,
Returning to nature’s unforced harmony.

Lead sprouts five colors,
Mercury radiates the Three Lights—
Only then does the Great Elixir’s lineage reveal itself.

Opening the crimson gate,
A golden crow leaps forth,
Soaring into the Jade Rabbit’s palace.

Holding Yin and Yang—
Their union in the divine furnace,
Cooking forth the boundless True Body.

Within the void,
Purple *qi* spirals,
Mysterious pearls gleam,
Piercing the dharmakāya’s primordial wisdom.

Forsaking worldly schemes to cultivate the Dao,
Hiding from traces to seek immortality,
Ever silently preserving the mind from decay.

Clinging to glory and splendor,
Fearing the wrath of the Red One,
The elixir is carelessly cast aside.

---
**Seventeen**
Piercing the depths of hidden mysteries,
Deeply understanding the elixir’s kiln,
Relying on the True Ancestor’s sacred accord.

Dragon plows, tiger sows—
Jade nectar and golden herbs,
What splendid Daoist work!

The elixir’s cauldron glows with light,
Behold a childlike form,
Swiftly vanishing—shocking Heaven and Earth.

Riding the purple clouds,
Emerald phoenixes come to greet,
True offspring of the immortals.

At the dawn of the Three Yang,
Jade medicine’s celestial fragrance,
Qixiang flowers and precious trees,
Enveloped by auspicious clouds.

Heavenly light shimmers,
Moonbeam shadows stretch—
The Great Transformation of the Peng bird follows.

Do not dismiss this as wild talk,
For within it lies clear distinction—
Only the adept recognize its subtleties.

Among the bold and virtuous,
Spirit refined and courageous,
Nature lofty and resolve unyielding.

---
**Eighteen**
With resolve piercing the clouds,
Spirit born of Heaven’s finest,
Escaping the endless search for truth.

Empty space as furnace, self as fire,
True nature encountered—refinement begins.

If the teacher is not enlightened,
Even near at hand, it’s as distant as a thousand miles,
And truth is lost in deception.

These yellow sprouts and red essences—
All mortals possess them,
Yet how many are foolishly blind?

True heroes seize fate’s mechanisms,
Piercing the chaos,
Gaining the luminous Night-Bright Pearl of Joy.

Gleaming with radiant treasures,
Flashing with sacred light,
Shadows vanish into the Great Abyss—no hindrance.

Do not let the mind’s monkey run wild,
Stealing the Golden Cauldron,
Wasting effort in vain elixir-making.

Igniting the Three Yang’s True Fire,
Ever refining, yet fleeing the Nine Returns.

---
**Nineteen**
Piercing frost and snow,
Facing wind and rain,
Meeting the Sage who awakens understanding.

Entering the subtle, penetrating the marvelous,
Reviving the dead, returning life—
This is the true rule of elixir refinement.

Separating from the perilous and uniting,
Returning to Yin and Yang’s cycle,
Requires the aid of the Wood Dragon and Golden Tiger.

Holding the Heaven-Earth cauldron,
The Five Phases arrayed,
Dwelling in the True Soil.

At the profound mysteries—
Sowing the yellow sprouts,
Burning into elixir,
To whom shall this logic be explained?

Phoenix brooding, jade-encased dragon pearls,
Flying forth from the depths of auspicious clouds.

**[Pulling lightning through the void]**
Speaking of the Three Corpses fleeing,
Six Thieves scattering in terror.

Revealing the Daoist embryo’s flight,
Five clouds swirling,
Harmonious sounds rising in chorus.

---**Twenty**---

---

**Nine**
To brave snow and frost, to meet wind and rain,
To greet the breeze and bathe in the mist—
A rare chance to find the Sage and gain enlightenment.
To grasp the subtle, enter the marvelous,
Revive the dead, restore life—
This is the Daoist standard for elixir cultivation.

Yin and Yang in harmony,
Turning the pivot of the cosmos,
The Dragon and Tiger coiling in ceaseless motion.

Who can fathom this celestial mechanism,
Its ebb and flow? Few understand its path.
How could one distinguish its true nature?

The logic of the Immortal’s Way—
Auspicious *qi* surging, blessed clouds ascending,
Purple mists veiling the golden palaces.

Thousands of deities gathered,
Ten thousand transformations complete,
Only then does the Great Elixir ripen.

The *qi*-tree blooms with jade flowers,
Filling the void with their splendor—
The True Landscape, emerald and vivid, stands revealed.

Beholding the Heart’s clarity like a moonlit dawn,
Cool winds sweeping the horizon,
The Celestial Cavern bright and open.

**[The *Peaceful Return* and *Rebirth of the Sage* Suites]**
Laughing at my humble self,
Ordinary passions I’ve cast aside,
Lightly abandoning my old fishing by the cliff’s edge.

Galloping through Chang’an,
Listening to the oriole’s song in the imperial gardens,
Yet in vain did I squander my youth in Luoyang.

At the Jade Hall, summons are issued,
Beside the Golden Throne, I join the feasts,
Repeatedly receiving imperial edicts on elixir refinement.

In what year did I dream beneath the huai tree,
Still clad in my humble raincoat by the Jiang River’s banks?
Heaven bestows upon me
Endless layers of cloud screens, the Five Lakes’ misty waves,
Wild monkeys and sand cranes—
Boundless wilderness, untamed.

At dawn, the Purple Pavilion,
By dusk, the Mysterious Isle,
My hair drying in the crimson mist of the forest’s edge.

The Azure Dragon leaps from the sea,
The White Crane ascends to the heavens—
In a single instant, all is fulfilled.

Gazing toward the Pure Celestial Court,
The crisp autumn winds and dews,
The Celestial Cavern’s first light.

---

**Twenty**
A quiet chamber to cultivate the heart,
Mountains and clouds to nurture the Dao—
Nearly encountering the Sage to receive the secret precepts.

The furnace stacked with the Eight Trigrams,
The cauldron prepared with the Three Talismans,
Building the foundation of Daoist practice.

Yin and Yang aligned,
Turning the cosmic pivot,
The Dragon and Tiger coiling in endless dance.

This celestial mechanism—
Its inverse and direct—
The scholarly currents do not comprehend.
How could one distinguish its true nature?

The logic of the Luminous and the Obscure—
Auspicious *qi* billowing, blessed clouds gathering,
Purple vapors enveloping the golden palaces.

Thousands of deities assembled,
Ten thousand transformations complete,
Then the Great Elixir is ripe.

The *qi*-tree and jade flowers,
Filling the void with their splendor—
The True Vision, emerald and resplendent, stands in array.

Gazing upon the Heart’s clarity like the moon’s bright reflection,
Cool breezes sweeping the eye,
The Celestial Cavern’s light piercing through.

---

**Second Suite**
Sweeping away winds and clouds,
Parting the dust like silk,
I’ve settled upon half a hill to hide my flaws.

A green pine as my shelter,
White stones as my bed—
All worldly cares now rest.

How many times have I visited Penglai,
Wearing a coarse robe, wielding a long sword,
Leisurely facing the waves’ serene clarity?

Whose home is this,
Where the wine is aged in the Immortal’s gourd,
Inviting me to share the bright moon’s gaze?

Returning now—
The Jade Palace vast and empty,
The Silver River stark and cold,
A single iron flute’s note splitting the mountain.

The Three *Hua* [1] encircle me in splendor,
The Nine *Qi* [2] weave like a net—
Lofty and ethereal, the Pure Celestial Gate.

Holding the *Fu Rong* [3] in hand,
Ascending the void in flying steps,
Tonight, how many will pay homage?

Then I turn—
The Northern Dipper as my ladle,
Scattering fragrant wine and snow across the purple cups.

---

**Third Suite**
When the mountain moon arrives,
The sea wind stirs not,
A jade tower and pavilion rise upon the plain.

The cassia’s fragrance drifts,
The dew’s luster like water,
I pluck the Celestial Flute, its notes delicate as silk.

Faint and distant, clear and distinct,
The Green Tortoise [4] transmits its sweet words.

Within the *Tai Wei* [5],
The *luan* [6] and crane seek each other—
All are old companions of the True Dao.

Hear now,
The Leopard’s Gate locked in layers,
The thunderous drums of a thousand officials,
The Celestial Realm’s endless courts.

The Stone Maiden pins her flowers,
The Wooden Man pours the wine—
Let me dwell here for a while.

Singing in lofty verses,
Wielding the brush with boundless strokes,
The dusty world is but trifles of past and present.

Look upon the Spring Mountain,
All in verdant green—
Why does it mock the broken clouds and lingering rain?

---

**Fourth Suite**
The moon’s brilliance, the frost’s chill,
My fishing boat like a leaf—
Leisurely crossing the clear, blue stream.

The Milky Way silent,
The jade rainbow arching over the wilds,
The Dipper’s handle now pointing north.

Half a black hat,
A few strands of white hair,
A single glance at the wild cranes in flight.

Ask of the returning Sage,
The old trees of the southern city—
How many have they seen of past and present?

At the Western Hua’s peak,
A flower ten *zhang* high,
Autumnal dew from the Nine Heavens,
Forming emerald chambers and jade fruits.

To cast off my shoes is no hardship,
Ascending the void—how distant?
Three gulps, and the snow melts into ice *qi*.

The *Divine Method of Abstaining from Grain*,
The *True Precept of Feasting on Clouds*—
Once gone, no trace remains.

Laughing at the world’s dwellers,
Long abiding in the void,
Who compares to a single wheel of red sun?

---

**Fifth Suite**
Loosening my oars in the boundless waves,
The setting sun’s last rays on the fallen clouds,
I lean upon the shore as the mountain turns.

Riding the wild geese, the double ducks,
Cutting through the reeds, drifting on the willows—
My body in a painted autumn scene.

The rain carries the sound of the shallows,
The wind shakes the candle’s shadow,
Midnight still finds me reciting my scroll.

Counting my parting emotions,
Why must they stretch to the heavens?
A mere step’s distance, yet the path is long, and people are far.

Laughing at myself alone,
The scholar from Luoyang,
The aged man of Xiangyang—
How often have they dreamed of me?

Old now at the Floating Mound,
Composing poetry beneath the bright moon,
A thousand *ren* [7] of verdant sky and sharp blade.

After the snow clears, the jade towers,
Spring blooms on the jade mats—
Let me host a grand feast in my old mountain home.

Waiting for the rooster’s crow,
The sun rising over Luo Fu,
Flying across the waves’ shallow, clear depths.

---

**Sixth Suite**
To drink wine while songs are sung,
Without cares to be resolved—
This is the Daoist’s true bearing.

A fine breeze passing through my ears,
The moon’s brilliance filling my chest,
The pure sounds of water and mountain hues.

A thousand years in the world,
Seven days in the mountains—
I’ve grown accustomed to wandering as a guest.

Across the void,
The Northern Dipper and Southern Star—
Who could ever truly grasp this?

Once I recalled,
The blue-eyed barbarian monk,
In a coarse robe by the boundless sea,
Lowering his fishing line a thousand *chi* deep.

Pulling up a whale,
The wind and thunder transforming—
Not a common marvel.

Cold and heat urging each other,
Heaven and Earth no longer needed,
Through countless kalpas, never stale with time.

Alas, my life—
Forgetting my lofty years,
Long accompanying children’s games and plays.

---

**Seventh Suite**
Remembering the Sage of the Slope,
Nightly wandering at the Red Cliff,
A lone crane skimming past my boat to the west.

The heroes have all faded,
My life and fate now obscure—
The moon is small, the waters cold, the stars vast.

How like the fisherman,
Unknowing of past and present,
Drunk beside the water plant and firefly.

In dreams we meet—
Feathers fluttering, robes swaying,
Not necessarily this moment, not I alone.

Who understands the Dao?
At the year’s end, the river is empty—
The wind’s force, the moon’s might,
Crossing spears and composing verse by the Jiang River’s left bank.

The evening dew on my garments,
The late wind at the isles,
How many short poems and long odes have I penned?

The Jade Palace’s lofty chill,
Where are my old friends now?
Vast and distant, my heart knows no rest.

I sigh at the journey,
Sailing the sea in a frail boat,
My followers not knowing who might accompany me.

---

**Eighth Suite**
Returning now—
Yesterday’s folly, today’s truth,
Sadness alone, my words in vain.

My path lost is not far,
Morning light soft and warm—
I command my guide to lead the way.

The wind lifts my light boat,
Children at the gate,
This day I behold my humble home.

Wine fills the cups—
Though the three paths are overgrown,
The pine and chrysanthemum still stand as before.

I’ll leave my arrogance,
Defying the world’s ways,
Old friends all forgotten—
Where else shall I ride my boat to?

---
[1] *Hua* (花) – Refers to the three *Hua* (flower-like formations) of *qi* in Daoist alchemy.
[2] *Qi* (氣) – Refers to the nine types of *qi* or breath in Daoist practice.
[3] *Fu Rong* (芙蓉) – A lotus flower, symbolizing purity and enlightenment.
[4] *Green Tortoise* – Refers to the mythical tortoise associated with the *Tai Wei* constellation, often linked to Daoist immortality and cosmic cycles.
[5] *Tai Wei* (太微) – A constellation in Daoist cosmology, often associated with celestial harmony and the abode of immortals.
[6] *Luan* (鸞) – A mythical bird, often paired with the crane (*he* 鹤) and symbolizing auspiciousness and celestial union.
[7] *Ren* (仞) – A unit of measure (approximately 500 meters or 1600 feet), emphasizing the vastness of the sky.

**其八**
Returning now, ah! What was wrong is now right—
Alone, I sigh in sorrow, speechless with grief.
The lost path is not far; dawn’s light glows bright,
And I command my guide to lead the way ahead.

A breeze lifts my light boat, children at the gate,
Today I gaze upon my humble home once more.
Though wine fills the cup and paths lie wild with time,
The pine and chrysanthemum stand as they were before.

I take my pride in defiance of the world,
Forgot my old friends—where shall I ride my boat to now?

---

**其九**
Strings and books, whispered words, seeking valleys and hills,
The weary crow perches where clouds and mist conspire.
The farmer tells me, “There’s work in the western fields,”
And I set forth alone, penning verse in spring’s rain.

But I take joy in Heaven’s decree—what need to doubt
The unfolding of Nature’s will? Let it come and go.

Ten years on the Jiang, ten years on Yan Mountain,
Accustomed to half a life of wind and snow.
Facing snow without a boat, drifting without snow,
No chance to meet those pure and lofty in spirit.

Broken shores, scattered sands—what night is this?
Like returning to Ke Xi’s stream, bound for Yue.

Yet I lift the sail, and there—
A few feet of plum blossoms, where human traces fade.

Do you not see the Five Elders’ perilous peaks,
Floating Master’s lofty summit, laughing at my early gray?
To reverse age, to refine the coarse into the subtle—
I have only the Nine Returns’ elixir in vain.

The sun breaks through, the sky dazzles the sea,
And all distinctions dissolve in oneness.

Then I can proclaim—
The Six-Yi Immortal Sage, the eternal bright moon of the Void.

---

**其十**
Sixty years returned, now past seventy,
Grateful for the Emperor’s grace and favor.
Early to bed, late to rise,
Drinking when thirsty, eating when hungry—
No cares, no thoughts.

A few volumes of tattered books,
A half-broken inkstone—
Enough for a scholar’s modest life.

Master Dao, write swiftly what I can recite—
Truly, I am far from here.

No more pondering—
Just lean on my green staff,
Wear my double-strapped sandals,
And walk to the ferry to watch the water flow.

The past rushes by, the present comes in waves—
Unmindful, the day grows late, the wind grows fine.

A fisherman calls out suddenly—
“What are you staring at?”

Then he helps me carry fresh fish,
And we drink together, drunk as one.

---

**十一**
A path leads to the depths of mystery,
A painted screen of emerald—
Walking to where white clouds gather.

Peaches of the world beyond, oranges by the well,
A garden of rare mushrooms and elixir plants.

Light taps on the *tan* board, the zither plays softly,
Offering phoenix fat and lynx meat.

Dancing, my white hair drifts like the wind,
Still like the old immortal companions.

Look—
Palaces of the gods, gold and jade in every hall,
This is the daily life of the *médhu* moth.

Five-colored Penglai, the autumnal *diāo* bird,
There is another path to transcendence.

Wine ripens with Ma Gu, clouds rise from Wu Gorge,
I bow to the Celestial Caverns and depart.

Let the sea waves be clear and shallow—
Where is the green window, the cloudy door?

---

**十二**
Light clouds, gentle winds,
Following flowers and willows—
As if youth’s joys were still mine.

High pavilions in the woods,
A small carriage in the city—
Eternal peace in the Western Luo.

Behold the vastness—
Speaking of the virtuous one,
The flowing water seems as it was yesterday.

But leisurely travels meet only light clouds at the sky’s edge,
Uncertain if sorrow or parting awaits.

I remember well—
As a youth, we followed each other,
Bathing in Yi and returning,
Reciting as the swallows flew, the fish leaped.

The past rushes on—
I am aging, yet I adjust my ways.

The *qín* strings hum in the sacred hall,
The old chamber’s bells and stones—
Hidden, I seem to hear them still.

The farmer tells me, “There’s work in the western fields,”
And my books hang from the ox’s horns.

---
**满江红**
*For Master Feng*

Seasons hurry by—
Suddenly, autumn’s message arrives.
Past deeds rise—
So many triumphs and failures,
A hundred years like a fleeting breath.

The scholar’s ambition unfulfilled,
The mountains early claimed my retreat.
I sought the Five Lakes’ leisure, but Xiqi’s joy was rare—
No gain, no loss.

Human affairs—
Full of sorrow and regret.
The world beyond—
A different rhythm, a different grace.

This Penglai is serene and fair,
Jade halls, golden seals.
Bound by mortal cares, yet my heart is pure,
My spirit soars like the gods.

See the phoenix welcome me to the azure sky,
The clouds guide me home.

---
**其二**
Rain passes over the eastern suburbs,
The stream’s trace is shallow—
Spring dawn in the mountain hall.

Worthy of love—
Peach blossoms in flowing water,
Leisurely clouds, quiet crows.

Beyond the world, the sun rises red,
A single green hill at the world’s edge.
Toward the green shade, bamboo shadows roll the gate,
Forever settled.

In this quiet—
Who knows?

The recluse of the world,
Rare in human company.

Let me embrace wind and cup, moon and wine,
Drunk on fragrant grass.

Great purpose contains the heavens and earth,
True feeling stands firm in Xiqi’s depths.
In vain I send news to the forests and streams—
Old in mist and clouds.

---
**其三**
High sentiments through the ages
Lie in forests, streams, and winding rivers.
Knowing this life is but a dream,
Why envy silk robes and grand halls?

I love the moon’s reflection on the carved dock,
The sage does not envy gold mountains or jade.
Joy fills the courtyard as flowers cast golden light,
Moss stains the green.

Forever—
The east hedge’s chrysanthemum.

A hollow-hearted staff,
Southern veranda bamboo.
Pillowed on books and *qín*, I sleep soundly,
Unshamed, at ease.

A thousand years of rise and fall—
A spring dream awakens.
One stream of clouds and water—
Enough for my life.

Look at the Three Wuling Beauties,
Their fragrant breath.
The elixir fields are ripe.

---
**其四**
Master of the Eastern Village,
Where is your home—
Mountain shadows, winding streams?

「其五」
A mind at leisure,
Bright and open—
The Daoist’s heart, straight as heaven’s void.
Though my body cannot yet rise weightless,
I dwell in a humble *Daoist* dwelling.

Within my cup, I gaze and swallow the sun and moon,
Not envying the world’s hoarded gold and jade.
Let the fleeting years shift like *qi*’s illusion,
Scattering crimson and verdant hues.

The cinnabar well’s bloom—
Golden chrysanthemums.
The *lingzhi* mushrooms, the *lángkān* bamboo.

Before the heartless wind’s carefree sway,
What honor or shame remains?

A hundred years of great dream drift beyond,
All worldly matters—
A mind’s content.

Toward mortal realms, three times witness the Yellow River’s clarity,
The peach of immortality ripens.

---
**其六**
A mind at leisure,
The *Hairy Skull Child*—
Endless birth and death.

「被化机，搬弄驰骋，许多颠蹙。」
Mastered by the subtle *qi* of transformation,
Skillfully manipulated and unrestrained—
Endless trials and tribulations.

Buying bones like mountains—what purpose serves?
Lost in passion like the sea—how to transcend?
Grief pierces the primal essence of things long buried in dust and ages.
A *Dharma*’s cycle of suffering.

To seek liberation, one must be fierce.
To find true companions, speak of ice and snow.
With diligent effort and refinement,
The luminous *Dao* shines through.

When winds cease and waves settle, the depths reveal—
Clouds part, the cold moon sinks into heaven’s void.

Asking the mute for honey’s taste—unspeakable.
**Its Seventh: Cloudyang Child**
Raising a void fist,
Unadorned by forms—
Scales and iron are but dust.

Daring to endure the weight of the world,
At times, one must be a man of unyielding resolve.
Ancient Buddhas pluck the flower with a faint smile,
Yet in this age, how few stand waist-high in snow?

Lamenting the cuckoo’s bloodied branches—who understands?
The mute’s dream, hard to discern.
The deaf, who grasp the meaning.

On a lone peak’s summit,
A wooden man speaks eloquently.
Cawing crows and howling monkeys debate the *non-duality* of the *Dao*,
While pine winds and mountain waters reveal its profound truth.

Breaking this mechanism, one sees the cold void—
Every household’s moon.

**Its Eighth: Yuan’s Original Intent**
At the beginning, nothing exists—
All *Dharma*’s roots obscured by the void.
Lamenting those who drift along learning the *Dao*,
Who refuse to sever before death.

Empty gestures and hollow punches—just noise.
Eyebrows raised, glances dart—endless posturing.
Seeing the light of wisdom fall to earth,
The virtuous rise—
Lifting hands and feet.

Abandon false thoughts,
Forget self and others.
Sever fame and gain,
Avoid right and wrong.
Accompany mist and clouds in secluded depths,
Walk freely with ease.

When realms dissolve, the mind forgets all birth—
The sky’s expanse vast and open.
A single wheel of moon reveals itself in the cold pool,
No deception in truth.

**Its Ninth: Mo’s Celestial Tripod**
*Dharma*’s essence lies in the primal void,
Its mysteries—
Beyond words to say.

Its core lies in guarding the *Zhong Zheng* (central rectitude),
The luminous *lingtai* (spiritual platform) clear.
The *Taiyi* (Great Polarity) dwells within the Yellow Valley,
Primal *qi* resides in the *Xuan Guan* (Mysterious Pass) orifice.
Motionless and still, yet responsive—
Relying on unyielding resolve.

Summoning wind and thunder,
Praying for rain and snow.
Commanding spirits and demons,
Driving away malevolent forces.
This is the *incantation of right and wrong*,
Neither talisman nor *geometric magic*.

In stillness and calm, the spirit returns to the Yellow Valley’s domain,
When merit is complete and the *Dao*’s path fulfilled—
Ranked among the celestial immortals.
Riding the auspicious clouds of the *Taiyi*’s void,
Toward the golden gates.

**Its Tenth: Purchasing Green Mountains**
Acquiring green mountains,
Then setting aside—
Straw sandals and a staff of *Ligustrum*.
No need to linger,
Below the *Jian Zhang* (Celestial Building) Palace,
At the *Ba Ling* (Farewell) Bridge’s edge.

The world’s chaos awaits like a snail’s touch,
While fame and gain are but ant-hills of hollow comfort.
In recent years, white hair has grown—
Three thousand spans long.
From now on, I cast off
The crimson dust’s entanglement.
A green stone pillow,
Pine winds echoing.

The *Four Worthies of Shang* (Mountain) come and go at leisure,
Fire dates and autumn dew—
A bargain’s worth.
Exchange pears, nurtured by spring’s warmth.
Counting those who’ve matched my carefree freedom since antiquity—
None but me.

**[The Farewell to Jiangnan] – Spring**
*Chou Changchun* (Spring in the Mountains)
Mountains are good,
Best in spring’s embrace.
Wildflowers red and white in myriad hues,
The *kuang ou* (mourning dove) calls in a hundred tones.
The misty greenery soaks one’s clothes.
Tea plucked fresh,
Bamboo shoots and ferns—
Like wild violet, gathered.

A hundredfold patched robe,
Forgotten worldly cares.
A few cups of rustic wine,
Aligned with heaven’s *Dao*.
Drunken, I let east and west drift.

**Summer**
Mountains are good,
Long summer suits them best.
Towering bamboo, a thousand stalks—
Golden chains shattered.
A thousand-foot cascade—
Jade curtains hanging.
Where is the scorching sun?
Beneath the pine’s shade,
Unrestrained and free.

Deep-fried plums and floating melons,
Serving as pillow and bedding.
Ancient pines and white stones,
Companions to the lute and chessboard.
Drunken, I let the winds carry me.

**Autumn**
Mountains are good,
Autumn’s scene is not desolate.
White wine, yellow fowl, and new rice—
Harvest’s bounty ripe.
Purple *zhu* (chrysanthemum) and golden *ju* (mallow), their fragrance pure.
Tangerines green with frost fill the woods—
Cool moon shines white,
Pines and *gui* (cryptomeria) stand dark and deep.
Only the village elder’s song of joy at the *she* (land deity) festival is heard,
No young men at the gate.
Drunken, what does it matter?

**Winter**
Mountains are good,
Yet the last praise belongs to winter.
Paper curtains and rush mats—
Fragrance faint, like jade’s pale glow.
Bamboo stove and tea kiln—
Flames burn deep red.
Crossed arms in warmth, the *chong* (tea ceremony) shared.
Man is but a dream,
A hundred years pass in an instant’s thought.
When plum blossoms burst, the spring’s pulse stirs,
Where snowflakes fall, the *yang* (sores/ulcers) vanish without trace.
Drunken, I am the slave of spring’s wind.

---
**Moonlight on the Sea-Tang (月上海棠)**
*Simao* (Simao) of the *Lun* (Lun) sect,
Ever mindful, never idle.
In coarse robes and hempen cords,
A satchel slung at my side.
Hair shorn, my head bare,
Unbound, I tread where I will.
With bowl and *dian* (bamboo begging cup),
Each day I alms-beg at the doors.
Bowing low, I take leave—
Then stumble upon a demon who speaks.

“Daoist Master,” he asks,
“Whose household are you from?”
I answer as fate allows:
“My teacher’s name is Qiu Liu Tan Ma.”

---
**Second Poem**
Last night, passing through *Bei Mang* (Northern Mound),
I saw a skull beside the road.
Rain washed it, winds blew—
A herdsman’s staff shattered its rest.
I knew him as Li Si, Zhang San, or Wang Da.
He bowed in silence, pondering me:
When death’s hour comes, how can one flee?
Though he had a thousand in gold,
No fortune could spare this calamity.
Cease your complaints—
All must meet the same end.

---
**Third Poem**
My words have warned countless thousands,
Yet none turn fiercely back.
I teach a thousand ways,
Yet they still cling to *huoyuan* (fire-karmic) bonds.
No reckoning—
Each life only defers the next.
Worried for sons and daughters without food or clothes,
They hope a hundred years’ companionship will last.
The *Yanwang* (King of Hell) arrives to demand,
Ghostly messengers knock at the door.
Dragged away, they do not question
Whether family ties are severed.

---
**Willow Pavilion (山亭柳)**
Worldly affairs are cause for sorrow,
The fleeting light of days cannot be held.
Spring fades, then autumn comes again—
The seasons press one toward old age,
A hundred years like *Zhuang Zhou’s* (Chuang Tzu’s) butterfly dream.
Seeing through the past as illusion,
Why cling to idle cares?
Boldly, I meet the *Xiyi* (Hsi-i, "One-Eyed") teaching,
Worldly passions—
All swept away in a stroke.
I vow to hasten my cultivation.
Yet fools, even when called by *Ma Dan Yang* (Madan Yang),
Still will not turn.
Bound by karmic debts, they become skulls,
Or wailing cranes in *Xu* (Xu)’s voice.

---
**Note on the Following Text:**
Below is the *Su Wu Man* (蘇武慢) composed by **Venerable Feng** (冯尊师) and **Yu Ji** (虞集), collected in thirty-three verses.
The text recorded in *Jiangcun Yezhu* (强村业书) by **Zhu Xiaozang** (朱孝臧) differs greatly from the *Dao藏* (Dao藏) version.
Here, I select several passages to correct and supplement the *Dao藏* text.
No further annotations are provided.

**#2 The following three are tunes.**

**Volume Three: Echoes of the Wandering Crane**
*Collected by Daoist Peng Zhizhong of Xianyou Mountain*

**Manting Fang (Full Court of Blossoms)**
**Wang Chongyang**
You were entrusted with the **Whole Truth of Quanzhen**,
Continuing the lineage of the Five Ancestors,
Briefly extolling the sect’s glory.
The **Laozi’s Golden Mouth** spoke,
Personally entrusting it to the **Western King**.
The **Holy Mother** bestowed teachings upon the **Eastern Master of Donghua**,
Binding the **Hua** and descending—**Zhongli** took the charge.
Transmitting the **Mystic Principle**,
**Liu Xiang of Rich Spring** and **Master Lü** awoke to the **Yellow Grain**.
Ascending to the Dao,
Fulfilling great vows,
Traveling along the **Gan River’s fate**,
And crossing over **Chongyang again**.

Journeying through Shandong and beyond,
Reaching the **Eastern Ocean**.
Witnessing seven golden lotuses rising from the waves—
**Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, He, Sun, and Wang**.
My disciples,
Gathered at the **Celestial Primordial Assembly**,
A thousand lotuses blooming in fragrance.

---

**#2 The Second: Master Ma Dan Yang**
My sword is no ordinary blade—
The **Jade Emperor** decreed it given to me.
Who else dares claim it?
A **three-foot green serpent**,
Often emitting auspicious light.
Stirring the **essence of Heaven and Earth**,
Splitting open **Taiyi’s True Yang**.
Who forged it?
**Ou Ye of Yexi**, blending **gold and water**—
Yin and yang in harmony.
Unknown where it is wielded,
Yet it slays demons and cuts through evils,
Bringing peace to all lands.
Turning the **myriad phenomena**,
All dissolved into **Mystic Frost**.
Only those who neglect cultivation
Lightly point—
Their **spirit and qi scatter**.
The sheath resounds,
Thunder shakes the heavens,
Ten thousand miles of ghosts and spirits cower.

---

**#3 The Third: Reflective Grasping**
A hundred years pass like a dream—
Why not live in ease?
Adrift in carefree joy,
Enjoying a tranquil self.
Days and months flee like arrows—
Unnoticed, **time passes**, **hair turns white**, **eyes dim**.
Reflecting on past and present,
Once-bold warriors now lie buried in **Beimang Hill**.
Better to cultivate virtue,
**Free from sorrow**, nurturing youthful vigor.
Fear not the **Limit of Impermanence**,
Taming the **wild horse of desire**.
Let not **spirit and qi decay**—
Lock the **White Ox** within the **Golden Barrier**.
Cultivation is no trifle—
Guard your own life as precious.

---

**#4 The Fourth: The True Person of Sanfeng**
A fallen, idle man,
A carefree vagabond,
Silent to all who pass.
Drifting like dust in the wind,
Coming and going through the streets.
Begging in alleys and lanes,
Dwelling in **ancient temples**, **vacant halls**.
If asked, *"Who are you?"*
**Gentlemen**, do not inquire—
The **Three Pure Ones**, the **Supreme Saints**,
**Zhongli and Lü** as their lineage.
Worshipping **Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma**,
Turning the **Divine Function**.
Obtaining the **Mystic’s profound use**,
A **Pure Void resolve**—
**Vague yet profound**.
Embracing **True Emptiness**,
Speaking of **Eternal Life**,
Mastering the **Three Teachings**.

---

**#5 The Fifth: Master Ma Dan Yang**
A young, enlightened child,
Taking the Dao as his path,
Listening closely to his teacher’s words.
Rising at dawn,
Sweeping the ground—**no dust stirred**.
Washing his body clean,
Then **wiping the pot**, **clutching the basin**.
In the kitchen,
**Pure oil, rice, and flour**—
Not a grain wasted.
When guests arrive,
Receive them with grace,
Walking slowly, speaking softly.
Guard **purity and poverty**,
Avoiding vain glory.
At dusk, sit upright,
**Mind clear**, **eyes bright**.
Do not stray—
**Heaven and Earth endure**,
A bright future awaits.

---

**#6 The Sixth: Yesterday’s Blossoms**
Today’s petals fall—
Counting the fleeting moments.
Marrying, planning—
**Eon after eon**, for whom the rush?
Once youthful and vibrant,
In an instant—**green hair turns white**.
Alas, the human body knows not **Impermanence**—
So bitter, so fleeting.
Better to **awaken early**—
Gold and silver piled high
Cannot buy **Impermanence’s arrival**.
Gazing at the **peaks of home**,
Tears stream in vain.
No children to replace you—
In the end, **you bear it alone**.
Heed my warning—
**Returning light, reflecting brilliance**,
Accompany **Master Ma Dan Yang**.

---

**#7 The Seventh: The Living Dead**
Men become **walking corpses**,
Women **hollow bones**,
Parents—**mere skulls**.
Children and grandchildren,
Generation after generation—**tiny skulls**.
Time passes, they grow,
Amassing wealth to **match their skulls**.
Filling the halls,
**Living ghosts** play with skulls all day.
The household’s master—
A **skull-man**, busy and frantic,
Nurturing **skulls**.
When death comes,
Who will tend **your skull**?
When the **three inches of breath** fade,
The **living skull** sends the **dead skull** on its way.
Do not grieve—
I urge you to **awaken early**,
Tending to **your skull**.

---

**#8 The Eighth: Returning Home**
Better to return—
Returning is best.
All else is **gain without profit**.
No **sorrow**, no **quarrels of right and wrong**.
Choose a **pure spot by the cliffs**,
Building a **small hermitage**.
At dusk, sleep soundly,
Until the **Grand Fast**.
Beyond this,
No other matters—
Adrift in joy, **who knows?**
High office may be sought,
Yet must be **pursued with humility**.
If surrounded by **flatterers and sycophants**,
**Gold belts** may **damage your robes**.
Consider—
A single mouth to feed,
How many **spoons** can it hold?

---

**#9 The Ninth: The Rise and Fall of the Dao**
The **Dao Teaching** first flourished,
While **Buddhism** remained obscure—
One rises, one fades.
**Bodhidharma** expounded the **Dharma**,
From **Eastern Lands to the Western Heaven**.
All later disciples,
Greedy for **wine and desire**,
**Corrupting the True Source**.
Quarreling over **wealth and power**,
Ignoring the **Teachings**,
Yet still hoping to reach **Western Paradise**.
A **once-in-three-thousand-years** opportunity—
The **Quanzhen Great Teaching**,
The **Year of Jiazi**, the **Heavenly Span**.
**Master Qiu** expounded the **Doctrine**,
A thousand golden lotuses.
**Celestial Assembly of Immortals** descends,
**Demons submit**—
Only the **Dao’s worthy** prevail.
Do you know?
This chance may not return
For **ten thousand years**.

---

**#10 The Tenth: Fleeting Beauty**
Children like blossoms,
Wives like jade—
Yet time slips away.
Piling wealth a thousandfold
Cannot buy **Impermanence’s arrival**.
Suddenly, **Yin Official** summons you—
No excuse, no delay.
Empty-handed you return,
**Wealth passes to another**,
Children scattered like leaves.
**The Wandering Crane’s Echoes** conclude.

「#10 The Tenth: Fleeting Beauty」
The wise and virtuous leave early,
Avoiding the **Fiery Realm**,
Breaking free from **busyness**.
**Master Qiu**’s **Scattered Leisure** descends,
Leaving behind **emotional tranquility**.
After hunger, one begs at **Temple Gates** for alms,
In cold, **paper and cloth robes** are sought—
No **entangling attachments**,
The **Immortal’s Path** remains unfinished,
Yet **divination** reveals **longevity’s extension**.

---

**#11 The Eleventh: The Hermitage Within**
The body is the **hermitage**,
The self its **abbot**—
Ears and eyes are its **gates and windows**.
The **walls** hold my **dwelling**,
My **belly** wraps the **kitchen**.
The **mind** is the **head chef**,
Skilled in **refining Water and Fire**,
To forge **Original Yang**.
When the **mind is at peace**,
Food ripens in due time,
And the **master** tastes it with delight.
Do not step outside the **hermitage**,
Lest you lose your way,
And fail to return to your **native land**.
Sit firmly within,
Repairing the **Central Cavern**.
Refine the **Golden Pillars** and **Jade Beams**,
Piercing through **clear winds** and **luminous moonlight**—
**Divine Radiance’s** essence.
Sit in stillness,
Unshaken, unmoved—
What fear is there of **harsh winds and frosts**?

---

**#12 The Twelfth: The Indescribable Dao**
The **Great Dao** is formless,
Indescribable, unspeakable—
The world fails to grasp its **root**.
It does not rely on **purity and clarity**,
Yet **filthy ink** seeks **scripted texts**.
If one clings only to **scriptures**,
The world has many **adepts**—
All would claim **Dao attainment**,
Filling the **Nine Heavens** above,
Crowding the **Jade Emperor’s Court**.
Why bother with **eloquent debate**,
Or exhaust **the Zhouyi Classic**,
Or lecture on the **Yellow Court**?
**True purity**, **true clarity**—
The **mind** must be free of **dust**.
**Divine Immortals** will guide you,
And then, you’ll **ascend to the Mystic Gate**.
In **profound subtlety**,
**Leisure and joy** unfurl—
All day, **laughing and chatting**.

---

**#13 The Thirteenth: The Trial of the Age**
In this **barren year**,
**Dao disciples** across the land
Suffer **demons’ affliction**, endure **calamity**.
Only now does **true sincerity** reveal itself—
**Dao companions**, in an instant,
**Generously aid** the **Celestial Immortals**.
The **Broad Virtue Heavenly Venerable**,
The **Loyal and Resplendent Martyrs**—
In the **Jiazi decade**, there are **five thousand**.
With **unyielding resolve**,
The **Nine Heavens’ Celestial Gate**,
Endless **golden lotuses** bloom.
When **demons** arise, **resolve** must come first—
Do not let **evil** sway your **mind**.
At the moment of **drawing the sword**,
Your **true nature** stands firm as a **mountain**.
The **Three Pure Ones** and **Holy Saints** appear everywhere,
Not bound by **meritorious deeds**.
No need to **fulfill rites**—
With **doubtless resolve**, the **Holy Saints** urge all **disciples**:
“Will you **forget form and body**,
And **ascend with me**?”

---

**#14 The Fourteenth: The Elixir’s Virtue**
Sweet **licorice**, **ginseng**, **Chinese valerian**, **peony**,
Thin **mint**, **schizonepeta**, and **chuanxiong**.
**Frankincense**, **myrrh**, **white chrysanthemum**, and **sweet osmanthus**.
**Pearl**, **gold**, **loquat**, **dang gui**, **honey-suckle**, **poria**.
**Goji berries**, **chrysanthemum flowers**, **dandelion**, and **reishi**.
**Huo xiang**, **divided doses** of **sichuan lovage**—
Each must be **measured precisely**.
What matters if your **whole body burns with fever**,
Or if **left and right** are **imbalanced**,
Or **headwinds** plague you?
Prescribe the **single character**,
“**Mouth**—**Nose**—**[blank]**.”
**Divine Elixir’s** efficacy is **verified**—
The **Noble Consort Li**’s **double vision** was **undone**.
Indeed, its **effect** pleased **Emperor Zhangzong**,
Earning an **additional promotion** to **Golden Rank**.

---

**#15 The Fifteenth: The Circulation of the Two Qi**
The **Two Qi** revolve endlessly,
The **Three Palaces** ascend and descend—
**Infinite cycles** of **coming and going**.
Piercing through **Gate-controlling Divine Water**,
**Lead and Mercury** pass the **Three Peaks**.
**Returning and flowing** through the **Eight Vessels**,
**Steel and Jade** refine—
**Yin Tiger**, **Yang Dragon** **flourish** in **Steel and Jade**.
At the **concentration of essence**,
**Golden Flowers** bloom—
**[Blank]** reveals its **form**.
**Divine Radiance** is **true transformation**—
**Heavenly Mechanics** run deep,
Hard to **fathom** or **guess**.
Even **fine wine** and **lustful desires**,
Like **autumn winds**, are fleeting.
The **Great Dao’s Mystic Furnace** ignites—
Within the **Three Fields**, **Divine Elixir** is **nurtured**.
When **refinement is complete**,
**Heavenly Scriptures** summon you—
**Effortless strides** lead to the **Palace of the Immortals**.

---

**#16 The Sixteenth: [Zhang Borden’s] True Iron Ox**
A **True Iron Ox**,
Ugly in form, **unyielding** in nature—
**Stubborn**, **contentious**, **fond of strife**.
All possess it—
Who **understands** its **bondage**?
**Sow the Yellow Sprouts** across the **Court**,
And **irrigate with Divine Water**.
Within the **Central Palace**,
If this **beast** were absent,
How could **[blank] babies** be born?
**Heaven and Earth** are **true stillness and movement**—
**Life’s essence** depends on it.
**Hungry**, it feeds on **tiger marrow**,
**Thirsty**, it drinks from the **Mercury Pool**.
At **midnight**, it **drags and refines** the **fire**—
**Bright radiance** **erupts**, like **ocean depths** **tossing light**.
The **herdsman** returns,
After feasting at the **Flowering Pool**,
Beneath the **moon’s clarity**.

---
**#17 The Seventeenth: The Illusion of Existence**
**Stone-fire time**—
Human life is brief,
Yet **birth and death** are hard to **guard against**.
**Born or extinguished** in an instant,
Like **lightning’s fleeting flash**.
**Piercing the illusion of form and body**,
One finds the **Immortal’s recipe** **for transcending the world**.
After **reflection**,
**Turning the heart toward the Dao**,
Seeking the **King of the Dharma**.
**Frequent meetings**,
**Walking and sitting together**,
**Drinking ambrosial nectar**.
**[Blank]**.
**Companions** are **clear winds** and **bright moons**,
**Shared resolve**, **shared vision of Heaven’s light**.
**Gathered reunions**,
**Visiting the Master** for **Dao instruction**,
**Singing the *Mantingfang* in the courtyard**.

---
*Mantingfang*
**Refinement**
**White Jade Hare**
The **Cauldron** uses **Heaven and Earth**,
The **elixir’s herbs** must be **black hare**—
Only then can **golden elixir** be **forged**.
**Tiger’s roar** from **water**,
**[Blank] Dragon** coiled in **fire**.
Even more so—
**Refining Lead** and **Shocking Mercury**,
From the **Primordial Valley** to the **Dusty Ball**.
A trifling matter—
**Kan and Li** **conjoin**,
**Returning youth** to a **child’s face**.
The **Five Phases** are **complete**.
If the **Four Symbols** are **unbalanced**,
**Fire timing** is **interrupted**—
**Like idle chatter**.
The **Six Heavens’ Aura** **points**—
**Jade** emerges from **Kunlun Mountain**.
**Clouds and rain** stir not a **hair**—
In an instant, **piercing the Three Gates**.
Within the **Yellow Court**,
**One Yang** **returns**—
The **elixir** is **ready** in **moments**.

---
**#2 The Second: The Three Teachings United**
**Daoist**, **Buddhist**, and **Confucian** doors—
The **Three Teachings** **merge as one**—
**Equal in status**, **shouldering the same burden**.
The **Dao** divides **Heaven and Earth**,
All **transformations** return to its **foundation**.
The **Buddha** **attains fruit** on **Spiritual Mountain**,
After **six years**, **meditating** at the **Snowy Peak**.
The **Confucian Teaching**—
**Warmth**, **gentleness**, **reverence**, **modesty**—
**Educates emperors** across **ten thousand generations**.
The **Great Dao** **transmits secret keys**,
The **Buddha’s Teachings** offer **skillful means**—
**Enduring insults**, **compassionate mercy**.
**Greatly accomplished**, **most holy**—
How could they **be ranked** as **higher or lower**?
All are **late learners**,
**Junior disciples**—
Some **deny**, some **affirm**, **debating right and wrong**.
Do not **compete in spirit**—
The **Three Venerables** are **one in essence**,
**Gazing upon** and **surrendering to** them **together**.

This incense—**naturally pure and refined**—
Born **before the Elephant Sovereign’s** reign.
In the **golden censer’s** flames, **auspicious smoke** ascends in spirals.
Not **sandalwood** nor **ambergris**,
Nor **four-harmony** dragon’s musk—
**Offered first** to **ancient sages**, then to **Five Ancestors of Great Luo Heaven**.

Its **mystic virtue** pervades the **Dharma Realm**,
**Qi and scent** complete and true.
It **opens the nasal passages**,
**Penetrating** to the **most profound Dao**.

May the **Eight Wastes and Four Seas** all **share this sublime transformation**,
**Dao-qi** **enduring** without end.
From this day forward,
**One brings blessings** for **ten thousand generations**.

---
**Its Four**
Life like **clear wind**, nature as **bright moon**—
**Luminous**, **self-revealed**, **radiant**.
**Spirit-light** universally illuminates—
When will it **not be revered**?

Ever present in **delusion’s realm**,
Yet **rising and soaring** through **stellar revolutions**.
**Penetrating true principle**—
**Neither absence nor presence**,
**Movement and stillness** **respond to divine mechanism**.

Within it, **countless matters**—
All **within the mind’s inch**,
Sometimes **right**, sometimes **wrong**.
In **each person’s practice**,
**Aspiration** reveals **high or low**.

The **enlightened**—**all are awakened**,
The **unaware**—**lost in every place**.
**Daoists cultivating the True**,
**Observing Heaven’s course**, **walking the Way**—
When **virtue is complete**, they **ascend to the Cloud Steps**.

---
**Its Five**

「Its Five»

**Longevity-bamboo** ever verdant,
**Longevity-pine** towering high,
**Longevity-mountain** and **Longevity-water** both complete.
**Longevity-star** and **Longevity-night**,
**Longevity-symbols** manifest in the midheaven.
**Longevity-prayers** for eternal life—
**Longevity-incense** burns a single stick,
**Treasure-cauldron** holds **dragon’s spittle**.

**Longevity-attendants** lead the way,
**Longevity-turtle** and **Longevity-crane**,
**Longevity-candle** rivals **golden lotus**.
**Longevity-tray** offers **longevity-fruits**,
**Longevity-peach** ripens at first,
**Longevity** fulfilled at three thousand.
**Longevity-feast** sings **longevity-tunes**,
**Longevity-wine** flows in abundance.

**Longevity** departs from here now,
**Blessings and longevity** boundless.
The **Longevity-ren**—
**Longevity-gate** lofty and grand,
**Blessings and longevity** eternally entwined.

**Its Six**

At dawn, **celestial hour** emerges to the street,
At dusk, **celestial hour** returns to the hall—
**Strictly follow** the **rules of conduct** in **body**.
With **sincere aspiration**, tend the **sacred flame**,
Morning and evening, **go forth** to **pay homage to the True**.
**Traverse** all **auspicious mountains** and **blessed lands**,
**Do not hesitate** to **consult** or **seek out** the **high sages**.
**Cease boasting**, **severate** the **self and others**,
Let the **heart’s ground** be **freely level**—
**Alchemy** and **medicinal refinement**,
Evening **zither** and **brushwork**—
Each has its **proper place**.
**Invocations** and **supplications** for **legal arts**—
All are **vain efforts** to **exhaust the spirits**.
**Better let go** of **seeking by fate**,
**Count** how much **toil** wastes the **mind’s vigor**.

**Section Seven**
Sit in unity, harmonize with boundless compassion—
All bones, though diverse, become one kin.

**Reduce food, sever attachments,**
**Confront demons in slumber**—
The foundation of sages and **Daoists** in cultivation.

**Advance others, retreat self,**
Act in accord with **heart-mind’s** subtleties.
When encountering scenes, **do not stir passions**—
In stillness, **nature’s essence** remains unshaken.

**Strive to know**—
From **great waves**, leap forth,
Yet return to **mystic obscurity**.

**Abandon greed for wealth, desire, wine, and qi**—
Unlock the **bond of gain**,
Sever **anger and delusion**.

**Perfect life and essence**—
Beyond things, what more is there?
**Awaken** to the **original nature’s** forms—
When **achievement is complete**, then **return**!

Riding the **crimson phoenix**,
Wrapped in **Penglai’s palace**,
Alone, you **walk to visit Zhongli**.

---

**Section Eight**
**Bow to all brothers**, briefly hear my counsel—
**Transform food** with morning sunlight, follow **fate’s flow**.
**Residual likes and dislikes**—
Only **firmness of heart** matters.

After feasting, return to the **hermitage** and sit in stillness—
**Useless speech**, seal lips, **conceal words**.

When others err, **see as unseen**—
Then the **heart’s core** finds peace.

**Cease seeking** the **mystic’s profundity**,
**Tether the wild horse of thought**,
**Lock the monkey-mind** tight.

**Eliminate self and others**,
**Extinguish fire, disperse smoke**.

**Fifteenth**
**All speak** of **smoke’s dissipation**,
**All claim** **fire’s extinction**—

**Unknowing**, **unaware**—
**How** **can** **one** **escape** **the masses**?

**The Dao** **is easy** **to walk** **and easy** **to grasp**—
**Yet** **the heart** **is lost**,
**Hard to grasp**, **hard to walk**.

**Heart-demons** **obstruct**—
**Before great virtue** **is achieved**,

**Lament** **the fame and gain** **of a thousand ages**,
**Racing** **like tigers and leopards**,
**Hills and valleys** **in a moment**,
**All** **accompany foxes and dogs**.

**Among thorns and punishments**,
**In the fading light of the setting sun**,
**Tombs in disarray**—
**Who** **knows** **whose**?

**Do you know**?
**All** **labor** **in vain** **for a hundred years**,
**Wrinkling brows** **in emptiness**.

**Better** **to return** **as** **one** **comes**—

**Second [Verse]**
**Not fond** **of light furs**,
**Clothes of coarse hemp**, **sandals of straw**,
**Letting spring** **and autumn** **be**.

**Though men** **mock me**,
**A life of rustic simplicity**,
**The world’s dust** **and clamor**—
**What** **do I ultimately seek**?

**External Penglai**, **inner Penglai**,
**A palm-sized realm** **within the jar**,
**This sect’s teaching** **is priceless**.

**Who knows**?
**Leisure’s joy** **is swift**,
**No envy** **of kings and nobles**.

**Many schemes** **only breed** **more sorrow**.
**Like swallowing** **the hooks** **of fame and gain**.

**Seeing** **before me** **these fleeting affairs**,
**Wasting Heaven’s secret**—
**Unwilling** **to withdraw**.

**Bees** **busy** **for flowers**,
**Moths** **drawn** **to lamps**,
**Only** **thus** **lost** **in front**, **forgetful** **of what’s behind**.
**Ah**, **the plight of life**—
**Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream**,
**The butterfly’s dream** **of Zhuang Zhou**.

**Third [Verse]**
**The Great Dao** **is nameless**,
**The Great Sound** **is rare**,
**The Great Vessel** **late in forming**.

**Laugh at those** **who mislead** **with shallow views**,
**Silence** **is best**—
**Like drilling ice** **for fire**,
**Or tying knots** **with pebbles**.

**Exhausting spirit**, **laboring in vain**,
**Seeking fish** **from trees**—
**When** **will** **this** **be cooked**?

**Foolish ones**,
**Grinding bricks** **to make mirrors**—
**How** **can** **they** **see** **the light**?

**Why** **scheme** **a hundred ways**?

**Abandoning love and hate**.

**Clarify the empty heart**, **fill the honest belly**,

**Long vision**, **eternal life**.

**Deep and clear**,
**Before Heaven** **and Earth**,
**One Qi** **vast and boundless**,
**Mingling** **in the primordial darkness**.

**Hixi’s principles**—
**This wheel of bright moon**,
**Never lacking**, **never full**.

**Fourth [Verse]**
**Auspicious snow**

**Sixth [Verse]**
The Peach Blossom Path—
No hindrance to coming and going,
Together we ascend and survey.

**Sixth [Verse]**
Urge the seekers to awaken,
Seize the Soul’s Platform—
Do not seek beyond!

This primordial mystery—
Not easily grasped—
Today, I tell you its roots.

The speechless old woman speaks,
The footless child plays with a ball.

True news:
Clouds bury the Jade Cave,
Moonlight gleams on the Golden Hall.

Who else can cultivate like me?
I tame the Lion and turn it to an ox.
In the Yellow River’s waves, I flip somersaults,
In the Sun Palace, I seize the wild monkey.

White snow blooms,
Green Cloud’s child takes the first step.
I claim the Mystic Pass as my own.

Leaving the Celestial Abode,
I ride the Qilong home,
Forever in Penglai Isle.

**Seventh [Verse]**
Last night in Nanjing,
This morning at Northern Peak—
Swiftly, suddenly.

I meet wine in the cave,
Drink when thirsty,
Use Mount Ju as my pillow,
Sleep deeply after drinking.

Boundless comings and goings,
Unfixed movements—
Half mad, half delirious.

With me always:
A chest of wind and moon,
Sleeves of cloud and mist.

Drifting through the world for years,
Now I prepare the Second Feast of the East Palace.

I topple the Jade Terrace,
Plant my Qí trees,
Shallow the Yellow River,
Cultivate my golden lotuses.

I shatter the coral,
Turn my back on Penglai,
Bow before the Void Emperor’s throne.

No difficult matter—
Eight hundred deeds accomplished,
Three thousand merits fulfilled.

**Eighth [Verse]**
Dissolving doubt,
Rejecting empty illusions,
Drinking and feeding as fate allows.

With cushion and meditation board,
I pass the daylight,
Facing the wind and moon,
To mark the passing years.

With a mountain boy in tow,
A willow staff in hand,
I lie down in the pine wind’s shadow.

From now on,
My golden needle and jade thread
Are sealed into smoke.

Why pass it down through generations?
The Weishui wind and pine have already revealed the truth.

In years past, I groped for the moon in water,
Now I understand—
Fire nurtures the lotus.

The highest teachings hold no deeper mystery.
Ten or a hundred—all return to One Thousand.

Turning my back,
I see the ocean’s stagnation cease,
Clouds disperse across the boundless sky.

**Ninth [Verse]**
Auspicious snow fills the heavens,
Blanketing the cosmos,
The sky like silver.

What matters wealth or poverty?
No depth or distance—
It falls evenly everywhere.

No speck of dust stains its flakes,
Silent as it falls, unseen.

The rivers and sky grow still,
Revealing the universe’s brilliance—
All things renewed.

It makes one suddenly rejoice,
Like a silver river flowing clear.

When gathered, it spreads like jade across the earth,
When scattered, no trace remains—
No form, no shadow, no sound.

This is the true work of Heaven’s mystery,
Not the hollow craft of mortals.

As the cold fades,
Waiting for the Three Yang’s full measure,
Spring renews itself.

**Tenth [Verse]**
From ancient times, wise and foolish alike—
The wheel of sun and moon drives them all
To sink into the underworld.

「The Han-era Zhang Chen Yi severed his Daoist path,
His mouth for fame and gain,
Indulging in extravagance and luxury,
Only to destroy his own home.

Tombs and ancestral halls by the riverside,
Han graves beside the fields—
All their power fades to nothingness.

Heroes of old,
All speak of leaning against ruined tombs,
Grasses stretching endlessly.

Ah, the past is truly pitiful!
Stained by hollow illusions, fleeting as blossoms carried by the flowing river.

Yet how much better to awaken now—
To abandon worldly toil and vain desires,
To dwell in simplicity and refine the *elixir field* (丹田).

Beyond the wheel of rebirth (輪回),
Ascending the sea of suffering (苦海),
Boarding the ship of *cool wisdom* (般若) straight to its tranquil shore (逍遥岸).

There, one meets the mysterious cloud paths,
Together visiting the *Peach Blossom Source* (桃源).
---

**Eleventh [Verse]**
What joy there is in aimlessness!
Fame and gain are trifles—
When will they ever end?

Counting wealth and splendor,
High rank and noble status,
Beautiful wives and daughters—
Would they ever practice *sustained cultivation* (持修)?

Cold to the *mystic gates* (玄門),
Clear to the *wondrous Dao* (妙道),
Bitter and harsh—who would linger on this path?

The path of cultivation (修行路),
Awakening to rebirth and death (輪回生死),
Shares the fate of the *transcendent ones* (仙流).

Beyond the body, all is idle sorrow.
Sever all grudges and resentments—then rest.

A plain cap of coarse cloth,
Living in harmony with green—
Adrift in clouds and waters,
Roaming the realm beyond things.

Wrapped in leisure, seeking more leisure,
Diminishing loss upon loss,
Extinguishing the fire, dispersing the smoke—no further craving.

When returning home,
This path to the *Netherworld* (酆都) will change,
Into the *Pine Isle* (蓬島) and *Yan Zhou* (瀛洲).
---

**Twelfth [Verse]**
The supreme *Dragon Spring tea* (龍團),
Crafted in subtle refinement,
From *Jianxi’s* distant trails.

Once gathered from the southern mountains,
Moon-brewed fat and crow’s blood,
Blended with the northern seas,
Seven treasures of numinous sprouts.

When spring’s warmth arrives,
It’s stored in hidden chambers,
Ground and pounded into fragrant dust—
Fine water is added.

Within the jade cup,
By the skill of *celestial boys* (仙童),
A golden flower is brewed.

This marvelous tea is fit for the *transcendent* (仙家).
Yet after savoring its aroma,
Only two armpits remain.»

「Fortunate indeed to find the *Daoist* (赵州) of Zhao Zhou,
Yet Lu Zang is nowhere to be seen—
Sweetness in the midst of bitterness,
Whose taste could one boast of?

Purge away all mundane thoughts,
Open the eyes of the *Way* (道),
Returning youth to aged brows—black as crows.

The divine marvels,
May all people understand their drinking,
Together partaking in mist and clouds.

**Thirteenth [Verse]**
From ancient times, the *transcendents* (神仙) have hidden their traces in Zhongnan,
Their teachings passed down through countless generations.
□ said on the *Sutra* (经) platform,
That with a needle, he revived the withered trees,
And beneath the *elixir furnace* (炼丹炉),
He transformed the maiden into the Stone Spring.

The Four Worthies of Shang Mountain,
The Ten Elders of the Ancient Cave,
Yin Xi listened closely to the *Scriptures of Virtue and the Way* (道德篇).

At the hermitage where they dwelled,
A green ox struck the doorpost,
A white deer ascended to the heavens.
The sacred sites of the *Immortal Sage* (栩圣) remain untouched.

The snow-like trinity was fully painted in three days.
There was Yuan Zhen of Wen Jian,
A dream beneath pine shade,
Zhongli coming to enlightenment,
And the *Golden Immortals* (金仙) riding cranes.

The Second Patriarch wore a coarse hide,
Guiding disciples at the *Sweet River* (甘河),
Transmitting the *Seven-Lotus Sutra* (七朵莲) of Chongyang.

The *Complete Perfection School* (全真教),
A *Cave Heaven* (洞天) of blessed land,
The precursor of the *Celestial Sovereign* (象帝).

**Fourteenth [Verse]**
The *Fire Hall* (火院) binds one in endless cycles,
Night departs, day returns—
No respite in the morning or the evening.»

「Today one knows not the morrow’s affairs—
Busy, cycle upon cycle, in endless striving,
Grieving yet still coveting.

Like a wind-lit lamp, man is fleeting,
Grass-tip dewdrops vanish with the dawn—
I see only sorrow’s tears flowing.

Not enduring long, like fire bursting from stone,
Or scum floating on water’s surface.
*"Cease, cease,"* the call to turn back soon.

Hook the past’s frivolities in a single stroke.
Plain robes and simple fare, let life’s currents pass—
Let others laugh, I care not who.

When death’s limit arrives,
Rich or poor, no matter—
What cause remains for endless night-and-day fretting?

Hear the young say:
*"Cast aside family ties, roam the seas like clouds!"*

**Fifteenth [Verse]**
*True Unity* (真一) endures eternally,
*Great Emptiness* (太虚) and essence one—
The wondrous gate opens by itself.

Since the *Mixed Origin* (混元) first began,
The *Two Principles* (两仪) set their stage,
Returning to the root, reclaiming vital breath—
All depends on the *Soul’s Platform* (灵台).

Vast *qi* (浩气) surges open,
*Valley Spirit* (谷神) merges with transformation—
A single spark of luminous essence arises in the boundless void.

Where concentration gathers,
Listen to the dragon’s roar and tiger’s cry,
The earth-shaking winds and thunderous *dharma* (雷).

Ah, the marvel of this wondrous Dao—
Unfathomable, yet it dissolves the foolish into great talent.

*"Now I speak it plain to you—*
Clear as a pearl held in the shell,
Or an autumn hare cradling its moon.

A man of bold resolve,
Once a noble of his age—
Do not let the world’s dust sully your mind and body.

When deeds are done,
Ascend to the *Purple Palace* (紫府),
Ranked among the *Immortal Stages* (仙阶)."

**Sixteenth [Verse]**
To become a *Divine Immortal* (神仙),
The alchemical labor—what difficulty is there?
Where lightning’s voice resounds,
*"[Unclear] [Unclear] [Unclear],"*—
The jade furnace blazes, the clay cauldron smokes cold.

Fair maidens ride dragons,
Golden elders cross tigers—
In a single breath, the Great Return is sealed.

Within the *Elixir Field* (丹田),
There is a white goose, one in number,
Flying into the mud pellet.

The *River Vehicle* (河车) ascends to *Kun Mountain* (昆山),
Not a hair moved—passing this critical juncture.

Seizing tortoise, serpent, and hare,
Alive and bound—
Sudden cloud and rain, one moment’s work,
A single spark yields the elixir.

White snow drifts across the heavens,
Yellow sprouts fill the earth—
Taking this *knife-elixir* (刀圭), one’s youth is ever renewed.

Constantly nourished,
It strips away the old and refines the bones—
The body soars among the clouds.

**Seventeenth [Verse]**
Great Wisdom, boundless ease—
Unfettered, free as the wild.

Housing refined aspirations and quiet joys,
Between pine and stone,
Singing deep until intoxicated,
Beneath moon and wind.

Jade maidens play their *sheng* (笙),
Golden boys dance with sleeves unfurled—
Guiding my *Original Qi* (元炁) into the *Great Mysterious* (太玄).

Within the Mysterious,
All logic drowns in vastness—
Coming and going, endless threads.

Ah, the marvel of these strange scenes—
Beyond mortal ken, a *Cave Heaven* (洞天) in itself.

*"[Unclear], standing firm and thick with virtue—*
Grinding years away,
While others mock my lightness—
The sea shall turn to mulberry fields.*

*Divine Qi* (神炁) surges in harmony,
Yin and Yang rise and fall—
Already I claim the *Free-and-Easy Immortals* (逍遥陆地仙) of earth.

No affliction—
Let my heart open, my brush run wild,
To inscribe these scriptures.»

**Eighteenth [Verse]**
*Venerable Master Feng* (冯尊师)
Boundless *Dharma-Voice* (威音) of ages past,
The moment of sudden enlightenment—
No need for external aid.

Let it rise, wild and unrestrained,
To the farthest reaches of earth and sea,
Idle clouds and forest cranes—
What care for the passing years?

Beneath moon and wind,
Free and easy, self-sufficient—
When inspired, sing high; when weary, sleep.

Where turning back begins,
Falling petals and drifting fluff,
Distant waters and light mist.

Originally, there is no teaching, no transmission.
The Dao is but a forced name—what true *Chan* (禅) is there?

These peach blossoms and willow greens,
Naturally fade and renew—
Why twist and strain,
Or strike bamboo and pluck lotus?

The Great *Dharma-Body* (相) is formless,
True *Emptiness* (空) is not a thing—
What thread of difference between the *Dharma-Realm* (法) and the *Great Thousand* (千)?

The stone lion dares not speak falsehoods,
Or prattle of earth and heaven.
Saying the *Dharma* (地), speaking of the *Heaven* (天).»

**Nineteenth [Verse]**
From ancient times to now,
A single *kshana* (剎那)—
Already a hundred years have passed.

Let *Stone Chong* (石崇) be rich and noble,
Or *Chen Ping* (陈平) poor and lowly,
*Yan Hui* (颜回) die young,
Or *Zhi* (跖) live long.

New paths and old graves,
All filled with countless fools and sages alike.
None see the
Twelve golden hairpins,
Or three thousand jade shoes.

Only because they failed to refine the *Returning Elixir* (还丹).
Each remains an ordinary man, with no predestined fate.

*"[Unclear], before the courtyard’s stubborn stone—*
It still could hear the *Dharma*,
The old tree by the city wall—
It yet understood the way to transcendence.

A jug of wine, a scroll of verse,
A zither played, a sword unsheathed—
All ties with mortal joys dissolved.

When asked, *"How is the Dao?"*
I point to the blue sky.

The candle’s shadow sways red,
Golden chrysanthemums bloom anew,
The jade hare’s glow swells bright in heaven’s clarity.
The *Chongyang* (重阳) feast’s splendor now unfurls—
A round mirror gleams.

At the *Central Upper Realm* (上界中央),
The *Willow of the Nine Boundaries* (桂花鲜) stands tall—
Clouds gather at the eight horizons.

Twisting green branches,
A white moon clusters—
Within, what mysteries unfold.

Countless fragrant herbs,
Hidden blossoms in the *Cave Heaven’s* (洞天) secluded gardens—
How many are there?

The high terrace at midnight,
Most worthy of contemplation—
Encountering *Perfect Clarity* (圆明), one’s insight is complete.

The wind stirs fragrant clouds,
Silvered mist and luminous pools intertwine.
A single cluster of frost,
An ancient wheel of ice—
Who knows their harmonious blend?

**Lyrics to *Lingjiang Xian* (临江仙)**
*"A Daoist of Free-and-Easy Ease"* (达道逍遥无事客),
Singing wildly through the day, joyous.
A lone nature, clear and true.

Like the *Three Isles’* (三岛) moon,
Or the *Nine Heavens’* (九霄) idle clouds.
Words and dreams beyond mortal reckoning,
The heart bears no dust of the world.

The four seasons’ flowers, all embraced in play.
A *Heaven in a Jug* (壶中天) knows no night,
The *World Beyond Things* (物外景) blooms eternal spring.

**Lyrics to *Yingchui Xu* (莺啼序)**
*"[Unclear]*

---
**Lyrics to *Lü Dongbin* (吕洞宾)**
The *Three Peaks* (三峰) path is treacherous,
Snow covers the cliffs, auspicious vapors rise.
By the ravine, hear
Dragon’s roar and tiger’s cry,
Lightning’s flash and stars’ brilliance—
A sudden crimson glow, ghosts and spirits flee in terror.

Lead condenses, mercury solidifies,
Nurtured in the furnace—
The elixir marks even the rubble.

A treasure supreme,
Yet fools consume but a single grain—
Extending life’s span.

How much more when there are
A million *Divine Pearls* (神珠),
Flowing *Celestial Dew* (霞) dazzling—
All threaded through the palace’s robes.

---

- *三峰* (Three Peaks) likely refers to a Daoist mountain or sacred site.
- *神珠* (Divine Pearls) and *流霞* (Celestial Dew) are alchemical terms for refined elixirs.
- *壶中天* (Heaven in a Jug) and *物外景* (World Beyond Things) are poetic expressions of Daoist transcendence.

**First Verse:**
*"Original title misnamed. #4 Unsigned in the original; *Complete Song of the Song Dynasty* attributes it to Ge Changeng. #5 The *ci* title is incorrect, inconsistent with the *qupu* [word-tune structure].
**Wuhè Yúyīn Juàn** [The Echo of the Crane’s Cry, Volume Four]
*Collected by Daoist Peng Zhizhong of Xiányóu Mountain*
**Sūmùzhē** [Veiled Screen]
*By Master Mǎ Dānyáng*

The Upper *Dantian*, the Path of Primordial Void.
Jade seals the Golden Gate—
Eight-Trigram pearls curtain the treasury.
Left, the Azure Dragon; right, the White Tiger.
In emerald robes, the Hu [Barbarian] monk—
This is the soil of the Three Pure Ones.

Tiger subdued, Dragon subdued—
Battle the Three Corpses, claim the River-Chariot’s way.
Tether the wild horse, the monkey-mind—
Lift the elixir to Kunlun’s peak,
Pierce into the *Níwán* [Brain of Perfection].

---
**Second Verse:**
The Middle *Dantian*—
Wondrous depths.
In the Treasure-Gathering Pool,
Five-hued *Celestial Dew* radiant.
The *Zhēnü* [Immortal Maiden] and infant laugh with joy.
Refined into Golden Elixir—
Worth ten thousand myriads.
Ingest but one grain—
Fragrant, wondrous.
Bone-transmutation, embryo-drawing—
All maladies vanish.
Turn back to youth, reborn in vigor.
Adrift in bliss, leaning on dawn’s rocky stream.

---
**Third Verse:**
The Lower *Dantian*—
The Dao of the Illumined Sage.

**Fourth Verse:**
The *Niu* [Ox] does not graze on common grass—
Jade nectar pools, its taste divine.
White snow, yellow sprouts—
Feed the Ox, and it grows fat.
Golden dragon’s head, silver coils entwined,
Luminous, dustless, like snow spread wide.
Wagging tail, shaking head, roaring loud—
Crossing seas, surging rivers, ascending Penglai Isle.

**Fifth Verse:**
Brightly radiant—*zìjīng* [essence], *qì*, and spirit—
Must be cherished, preserved with care.
A single grain of Golden Elixir,
Sold on every street for forty years—
No one buys.
Amidst the blooming flowers, the debt of love is repaid.
The *jiǔsān yáo* [hexagram 93]—*Dìtiān Tài* [Earth-Heaven Harmony].
The Golden Crow ascends, flying into the Silver Hare’s realm.
A hundred-foot pole—just one step more.
These efforts—let others vie in vain.

**Sixth Verse:**
Ah, the human body—like a puppet marionette,
Adorned in five colors, all deceit and illusion.
Arms crossed, standing at the stage’s edge, discussing past and present,
Calling to one another, dancing vainly before the crowd.
When it comes, like wind and rain.
When the breath is spent, the seven *pò* [spirits] and three *hún* [souls] depart.
Though you beat the painted drums before the stage,
You cannot call it back—no return path remains.

**[Southern Tune] *Shēng Cházǐ* #1**
Last night, a sudden longing arose—
Behold, a few moths fluttering near the lamps, worthy of lament.
Love, desire, greed, and anger refuse to let go—
Mistaking lamp-light for the sky’s ascent and descent.
Before the flames, they caper wildly,
Yet fear not the burning—
Until they turn to ash within the lamp.
Then—no more. No more. No more.
I urge you, all—heed my warning:
Do not, like moths, cling to love’s illusion.
Love’s embrace ages you—
Wrinkled face, white hair, hunched back, bowed head,
Deaf ears, dim eyes.
Seek no return—sever past pleasures with a single stroke.
While the body thrives, act with clarity and boldness.
Leap free from the mortal cage—
Then all is resolved.

**Dissolving Knots of Grudge** *[Chóu Jié]*
North and South—each a day,
East and West—each a day,
Together, the four directions share the sun.
In dreams, deep and drifting,
The passing of days comes and goes.
Await the day when the Dao-heart opens.
A hundred years—brief as a glance—
All are but fleeting days.
Push them aside, this morning and tomorrow.
Unaware of pushing, the day of saintly news arrives.
The Celestial Cavern opens—
That is the day I return.

---
**Second [Section]**
Mountains and rivers now at peace,
No more war—*Tàipíng* times, eight directions harmonized.
Frequent fasts and offerings,
Repaying the boundless heavens and earth.
Thanking the hidden kindness of the *Hong* [Great] Benevolence.
A thousand years—once in a lifetime—
Divine ones descend into the world.
Fortunate to meet them—do not treat lightly.
Strict and precise offerings,
Each year surpassing the last.
On auspicious days, all indulge in joy.
The *yīng* [swallow] flies south—
A joyous migration.

**First [Section]**
Death and life—both are feared.
This wheel of rebirth, selling bones—
How can it ever cease?
Unenlightened to the True Constant,
Forcing growth of branches and nodes,
The nature of life and death remains unpenetrated.
Within existence, yet failing to grasp—
Beyond existence, yet no containment—
Difficult to discern true from false.
Abandoning all dharma.
This original single point—
Where shall it be anchored?
Dare I ask such words?
Cultivating the True, nurturing the nature—
How can one cling to it with fixation?
What is the utmost clarity of mind,
What is the true seeing of nature,
What is the utter detachment from all ties?
What is the clarity of moon and wind,
What is the luminous, unencumbered freedom?
Realizing the True Law.
I beg my revered teacher’s compassion,
To guide and awaken me.

**Second [Section]**
Death and life—no longer feared.
With the fierce wind’s single sweep,
All is done away with.
Revealing only the True Constant,
No growth of branches and nodes,
The nature of life and death has no high or low.
No inner or outer—
Within it is contained—
Originally, no true or false.
Illuminating all dharma.
This True Suchness point—
No need for anchoring.
Awakening to the word of no birth.
Non-doing, non-action—
The Great Dao holds no fixation.
Six-two clarity of mind,
Ever-present seeing of nature,
Only this—detachment from all ties.
Everywhere, moon and wind’s clarity,
Truly luminous, unencumbered freedom.
Realizing the True Law.
True emptiness, self-liberated,
Neither born nor transformed.

---
**Third [Section]**
The Great Dao is formless—
How then does the heart’s measure rely on it?
It lies within all people,
Yet wisdom’s insight is bright and clear.
Able to subdue all desires,
To sever entangled emotions.
Being at ease in the midst of chaos,
Calm in the midst of busyness,
Pure in the midst of filth.
A demeanor like that of an infant,
A heart as cold as ice.
From the very fog of ignorance,
Awakening breaks through the path ahead.
My words are a blessing—
Listen deeply, my friend.
Ten parts of effort,
Ten parts of resolve,
Ten parts of sincerity.

**Second [Section]**
The Great Dao is formless—
How then does the heart’s measure rely on it?
It lies within all people,
Yet wisdom’s insight is bright and clear.
Able to subdue all desires,
To sever entangled emotions.
Being at ease in the midst of chaos,
Calm in the midst of busyness,
Pure in the midst of filth.
A demeanor like that of an infant,
A heart as cold as ice.
From the very fog of ignorance,
Awakening breaks through the path ahead.

The heart’s desires dissolve and vanish,
Detached from the roots of dust and defilement.
Joy in emptiness—
Serene and refined, revering the True.

Form like a wild crane,
Nature akin to lone clouds.
Wherever one arrives, home is found,
Wind as companion, moon as neighbor.

Dwelling in the world without attachment,
Exceeding common customs with transcendence.
Seizing the profound mystery—
Lo, lo, lo!□
A single thought’s reflection,□
Ever fresh in countenance.

Attaining the True’s supreme power,
Perfecting the True’s conduct,
Serving the True Sovereign.□

**Ballad of the Jade Emperor’s Consort**
Sitting in meditation, speaking of Dao and dharma afterward,
Rising, yet not clinging to the slightest trace.
The heart seeks its own musings,
Loves to be dull and foolish.
Daily life’s myriad mechanisms—
How often has one extinguished even a single one?
To crave divinity as an immortal,
How difficult it is by heaven’s decree!

**Second [Section]**
Pursuing the Dao requires a single resolve,
Without resolve, escape from life and death is hard.
Facing all phenomena, resolve stands firm as a mountain,
Naturally at ease.
All dharmas do not depart from purity and stillness,
Only when the mind is settled can one grasp the True Self.
Understanding this profound emptiness,
The Dao must be traversed.

**Autumn Dawn at the Congealing Horn**
Floating life, restless and hurried,
All worldly desires swept away.
In vain do you struggle for livelihood,
Drowned in the ocean of attachment.
Mocking the clever and cunning,
Competing for wealth and honor in dreams.
Even with countless honors and riches,
Who cares for the swift passage of time?

**Second [Section]**
Worldly affairs press on—
Do not weary your heart with ceaseless toil.
Abandoning dust, return early to the forest’s shade,
Covering yourself with a humble thatched hut.
Reflected in the window, sparse bamboo,
A rustling wind stirs jade-like clarity.
Endless green hills as friends,
Heedless of the fields’ rise and fall.
The petals scatter across the path,□

**The Fisherman’s Song [by Lü Dongbin]**
The west wind blows through the Wei River,
Fallen leaves fill Chang’an.
Busy in the dusty world,
Yet alone in serene leisure.

Naturally the furnace and cauldron,
Tigers circle and dragons coil.
Ninefold elixir refined,
A single pill of sharp efficacy—
Feeding it, one becomes a god of mortal lands,
A thousand needles, a priceless belt of marten fur and phoenix feathers.
Riches and glory seek to intoxicate the heavens.
The yellow grains are still unripe,
The dream shatters, leaving only remnants.
In the sea of contention,
Standing firm in the True Dao is hard.
With a sweep of the sleeve, I depart to the south,
White reeds and red willows,
Revisiting the hermitage at Pu Mountain.

**Mountain Stream**
Better to return than to stay,
Becoming a man of tranquil ease.
What need is there to provoke,
Others’ endless troubles and strife?
Heaven’s vast allowance—
Where cannot one take shelter?
Let me just wander,
With a life of means,
Testing thoughts to see.

In the mirror of the lake,
Shallow hills by the forest’s edge.
Dwelling in a small hermitage,
Living by fate’s modest share—
Coarse robes, simple fare.
Mocking the wind, praising the moon,
Carefree beyond all mortal years.
Worldly affairs,
All like hemp—
Who can I blame?

**Wandering Drifter**
Between emerald bamboo, verdant pine,
Layered shadows deep.
The Daoist’s pavilion in clouds of white.
Across the shore, red dust cannot reach,
Water soaks the cold void.
This scene matches that of the **Qiao** hermit,
The sage of the cave’s entrance.
After plucking the zither, he overturns the golden incense burner.
Laughing defiantly at mist and haze, he has no cares,
Beneath the bright moon and pure wind.

**Second [Section]**

---

**The Third [Section]**
**A Master of the Dao**

A lone master dwells within the **Ling Palace**,
Formless, shadowless, and without trace.
Iron eyes and bronze gazes fail to perceive him—
His body seems the very void.

He neither breathes nor lets the wind pass through,
Nor can earth and heaven contain him.
Yet I have captured him within my **medicine tripod**,
Stirring the **Three Heavens Sanhui Fire** to refine his true essence.

**The Fifth [Section] of the Second [Poem]**
**Lu Dongbin**

I have a house of three rooms,
Deep within the mountain’s embrace.
No walls nor gates to bar the four sides,
The myriad forms of the world as my **purlins and brackets**,
The sky my roof of azure tiles.

For decades, it leaks not a drop—
All part of my past destiny.
When my merit and practice reach three thousand,
I shall command the **living dragon** and subdue the **tiger**,
Only then shall I be counted among the **Immortal Ones**.

**Eternal Happiness**

Busy yet stealing leisure,
Amidst the clamor, finding stillness—
Let fame and gain no longer vie.
Limited time, endless dusty affairs—
When shall my cravings cease?

The heartless **crow and hare** hasten my aging,
Stealthily turning my green locks to gray.
This body, this form—
A fleeting union of illusion.
What proof can there be of its permanence?

Living as fate dictates,
Harmonizing with the world’s dust,
What idle sorrow or vexation could I endure?
Wealth and glory come from heaven,
Honor and splendor are my destiny—
Do not trouble your mind with schemes.

When the heart is free of cares,
And all before you is clear,
Then all is joy—this moment’s true landscape.
If you seek such perfect contentment,
Patience will reveal its path.

**Crossing the Golden Crane**

**Niu Zhenren**

At the **Jade Hall of the Dawn**,
The **Daoist Immortals** gather at their **feast of the immortals**.
On auspicious days,
Fragrant incense burns together,
Releasing **auspicious mists** and **lucky vapors**.

Celebrating the **Three True Ones** and the **Five Ancestors of the Double Ninth Festival**,
I pray that the **Holy Sovereign** may endure forever.
In ancient times, there was **Xuanyuan**,
Riding the dragon, soaring aloft,
To the **Jade Emperor’s court**, where he strove to lead.
Then all **Ten Thousand Saints** assembled,
Feasting and lingering in divine revelry.

The **celestial music** resounds,
**Golden Boys** bear the cups,
**Jade Girls** deliver the decrees.
At the **Palace of the Gods** and the **Immortal Gardens**,
Strange and wondrous scenes unfold—
**Cranes and phoenixes descend**, while **cranes dance** in graceful flight.
The **Immortal Boys** announce:
The **Peach of Immortality** is now ripe,
And the **Cinnabar Osmanthus** has blossomed.
For ten thousand years, the **Golden Tortoise** bears witness,
A thousand autumns, the **Jade Hare** remains—
When the **Old Man Star** appears,
All these wonders are celebrated.
The **Caverns of the Immortals** surpass mortal joys—
No coming or going,
Heaven and earth share his lifespan,
Sun and moon his years.

**Treading the Dew**

A **hempen robe** to wear,
A **paper quilt** to sleep.
My **gourd staff** is all the baggage I need.
With three cups and two bowls,
I find pure joy in heaven’s way—
Who could argue with my ease?

All around, the **common folk** scramble for fame and profit,
Each morning scheming to fill their bellies.
Let them eat **earthen dumplings**—
Only then will they know the taste of **plain fare**.

**The Wild Horse Blooms with One Branch of Flowers**
After the rain, the **mountain flowers** burst into bloom.

**Mist Disperses, Clouds Retreat to the Celestial River**
In tranquil seclusion, I wander where peace is pure.
Before the ancient cave’s rocks,
I often refine the **Golden Elixir**.

I care not for riding fat steeds,
Nor wealth and honor’s fleeting fame,
Nor the tangles of right and wrong.
Alone in my thatched study, I pore over ancient texts,
Turning the **Dao Classics** again and again.
Strumming my **horizontal zither** on my knee,
A crane arrives to greet me.

Though **purple sashes** and **golden seals** mark high office,
They are what they are—
Yet even then, at dawn’s fifth watch, the rush to mount,
How could it compare to my **Daoist life**,
When at noon my gate still stands closed?

**Spring Exploration Order**
At the **Grass Hall’s** third watch, I dream of soaring—
To **Penglai’s** halls and **Kunlun’s** gardens.
Where white clouds blanket the earth, untouched by broom,
Truly a hidden grove—
Fragrant winds swirl endlessly.
The **Celestial Worthies** gather in the **Golden Hall**,
Drinking **Liquid Immortality** in revelry.
Suddenly, a wave of cool clarity washes over me,
Like moonlight seen atop a mountain.

**Yellow Crane Cave Immortal (with *Wild Horse*)**
**Master Ma Dan-yang**
All day, I drive the **salt cart**,
Whip and rod striking again and again.
I count my spirit long bent and weary,
Like a sickly horse.
How could I ever find ease?
When **Master Beryle** arrives,
He sighs deeply upon seeing me.
With clever schemes, I redeem my life,
Becoming a **noble steed**.
I must repay my teacher’s kindness.

**Dreamless Order (Two Poems)**
Awakening suddenly, a hundred years pass like a finger-snap—
Tears burst forth like scattered pearls.
I rush to dissolve the sorrow of life and death,
Why fret over **fire in the stone**?
Let the **fire in the stone** rage—
Let all collapse beneath the earth.
Learning the **Dao** is neither hard nor easy—
How dare I stop when I have not yet begun?
I focus on **mortifying the physical self**,
Until I grasp the art of **eternal life**.
**Eternal life’s secret**—
Gathering **qi** and spirit bright.

**Willow Leaf Green**
A **hemp robe**, straw sandals—
I’ve wandered the world’s markets,
Mingling with clouds and morning mists.
Whatever fate brings, I take it in stride,
My staff bearing **Yi Jing** and **Zhuangzi**.
When guests ask of mortal affairs,
I point to falling blossoms in silence.
Refining my **water-and-cloud** nature,
I tread wherever home may be.

**Plucking a Single Plum Blossom**
A **rough linen robe**, loose and wide,
A **carefree bearing**, sleeves fluttering free.
My **water-and-cloud** tasks keep me company with fishermen and woodcutters.
Let tonight pass as it will—
Ask not of tomorrow.

**Nine-Noded Azure Dragon’s Staff**
A single staff—nine joints, the **Daoist Dragon** borne aloft.
**Daoist scriptures** in handfuls, slung across my shoulders.
A tiny **elixir field** dangling at my waist—
In motion, boundless ease; at rest, boundless ease.

**Drunk in the Taoist Paradise**
No need to speak of its origin—no words at all.
Serene and still, profound and tranquil.
Tranquil and still, ever **lethal qi** complete.
Within, I observe the **Mystic Dao**.
Dao’s subtlety, subtlety’s Dao—
No form to grasp, no roundness to seek.
Come and go as I please—
Who can bar my way?
Before **clear winds and bright moons**.

**The Female Daoist’s Song**

**Ma Dan Yang**
Human life is fleeting—see the **blue-green clouds**,
Rain passing over **mountains and waters**.
Youth’s bloom has faded—centuries like a dream,
Like **Xīyī**’s forgotten name.
Cast off all **emotional attachments**, sever all **affections**;
Tame the **wandering thoughts** and **monkey-mind** with iron resolve.
Endless and intricate—
Like breath exhaled, never certain to be inhaled.
Ten years’ effort, yet still the **Daoist Path**’s essence unfolds.
To become a **true immortal**—never a misstep.
Disciples, hold no doubt.
If any lie or deception lingers,
**Ma Wind’s punishment** will make you a **ghost of Yīnshān**.

**Mind and Action Ever Clear**
Through all **Ten Directions**, I perceive **Heaven and Earth**.
With **meritorious deeds** accumulated,
The **Golden Boy** will come to claim you.

**Returning to the Morning’s Joy**
Where did I lodge when **Heaven and Earth** first split?
No **parents of birth**, what name did I bear?
This truth must be made clear—
Probe its depths, let no argument arise.
Transmit the **unutterable** with precision,
And past lives may be fully examined.
Frequent comings and goings—
Lost in confusion, when shall I receive **enlightenment’s grace**?
Suddenly, before the **True Spirit**,
The **formless vision** is joyously revealed.
Awake and aware—what stern **Daoist principle** do I behold?
Radiant and reflected, all is **ease**—*Yìjīng*’s **#6**.
When seen, only the **subtle Dao’s essence** is sought,
A lofty depth that shines with **perfect light**,
Five **auspicious hues**—all signs of **fortune’s return**.

**The Six-Miao Melody**

**Wang Zhongyang**
**True purity, true stillness**—
This is the **harmony of Tiger and Dragon**.
Clear and profound—
**Innocent child** and **maiden** rise naturally.
**Silent meditation** is the **root of the Dao**,
**Fast and abstinence** shift **East and West**.
At the **twelve critical moments** of time,
Ever **mindful and aware**,
Within, refine **qi and spirit**—**jade furnace**’s ** Daoist practice**.
Why seek **branches to pluck** or **leaves to gather**?
What need to discuss the **elixir scriptures**?
My **Dao’s profound subtlety**—
Know **laziness and decline**, yet still **emptiness** prevails.
Banish **sleep, speech, and desire**,
Diminish **food and drink**—**fusion**’s the aim.
**External frugality**, **thin human ties**,
Break **thoughts**—**gradual enlightenment** opens wide.

**The New Cool’s Praise**

**Chen Yizhi**
A full cup—**heart-opening wine**.
Count **life’s discontents**—
Nine out of ten.
**Nature’s child** plays tricks—
Upside down, then right again.
I’ve only **chased dust** in vain.
When **sages are satisfied**, let **fools speak**.

**Red Peony**
**Wang Tongsu**
A hundred years of life—
seventy is rare.
Subtract ten years for childhood’s care,
another ten for age’s decay.
Fifty years remain—
half stolen by slumber’s sway.
Within those twenty-five,
are troubles not to be denied?
Reflect well, then—
pursue joy while time allows.
With wine and friends, laugh boldly,
let jade cups crash and shatter.
Drink deep, drink long—
life’s like dew on morning grass.
Fortunate now, with wine like Mian’s,
to weave songs for ages yet to pass.

**Praise for New Peace**
**Hua Danyang**
**Wang Chongyang**
Limited flesh, boundless fire’s hall—
time’s swift blade presses on.
Man’s life, like a candle in the wind,
all day’s rush, all night’s alarm.
The foolish, lost in endless schemes,
bound by family’s chains.
Loving sons, pitying wives—
tyrants who ensnare the soul.
Awaken, break free—
sever name’s bonds, topple love’s mountain.
Leap from passion’s sea,
unfettered, Dao’s bliss unfolds—
half a sheet, one lute.
Rest on the couch, but tether not the mind,
lest strife disturb the heart.
When wisdom’s sword is drawn,
demons fall, gods stand still.
Qi’s union—dragons race, tigers bound,
golden rooster, jade hare greet the dawn.
Enter the jade furnace, gold cauldron’s glow,
refine the sun-spirit, rise to Heaven’s court.
This lineage’s purity—
ice-clear, jade-white—
nods thanks to kindred souls.
To achieve true harmony’s prize,
worth more than gold.

**The Grand Minister’s Air**
**Tan Zhenren**
Neither monk nor layman, nor immortal sage—
a thatched hut, two or three beams.
White stone, clear spring—
who seeks the Peach Blossom’s hidden realm?
One furnace’s talismans,
one cup of spring’s snow,
to nourish the three pure fields.
Lost in thought on *Gu Shen’s* verse,
unaware the moon rounds the pine.

「其二
Time and tide fly swift, never stay,
Spring fades and autumn comes again.
Unfurling the brows from frowns,
Let’s sing in harmony—
**Daoist songs** to dispel cares.
A hundred years, a fleeting glimpse,
Striving for fame and gain,
Only to stir vain, idle woes.
Cease this bitter craving chase,
For if life’s path is crossed,
Let fate’s wind guide you home.

**其三**
A hundred years’ deeds—
in the mirror’s gaze, how frail!
Lament the ancient traveler’s plight,
For life’s road has ever been hard.
Wind and rain age the face,
Who cares for **An Ren’s** white hair’s spread?
Lofty renown, soaring **qi**,
Yet dreams dissolve like willow’s shade.
Turning back to ask the green hills,
They answer with a single cloud—
free, unbound, at ease.

**Green Jade Tablet**
The **Dao of Non-Action** is hard to grasp,
Yet simpler than you think—
Just lack the effort, and you’ll miss.
A sudden awakening brings back the light,
Ever reflecting in your mind.
Within the **Three Pure Fields**,
Among the **Six Palaces**,
Sweep away the dust again and again.
Where all ties are severed, the heart finds peace.
A spark of **empty luminosity** shines forth,
And you’ll know the **Primordial Dao of Pure Stillness**.
Passing through a hundred gates,
Harmony flows clear,
Your true nature bright and whole—
Then you’ll step forth onto the **Immortal’s Isle**.

**其二#８**
Since parting from the **Eastern Capital’s** road,
I’ve dwelled in the **Panshui Temple** by the west,
Where the **Panshui River** winds.

**南山云寂渺**
Gradually knocking at the southern mountain’s silent clouds,
A thatched hut—cool and detached,
Earthly honors cast aside, carefree.
No officials ever come here.
At night, the lanes are quiet, travelers gone—
Suddenly, the rock’s child-cuckoo calls.
*(Its cry pierces the pine branches till dawn.)*
Each note urges: *"Why not return?"*
Yet—how little effort I’ve made.

**贺圣朝**
The grass hut sleeps beneath the morning’s glow,
Blue-robed attendants seal the door,
The crimson-crested bird returns to its nest.
Clutching my jade zither, I dream of the Immortal’s Isle,
Waiting for leisure to seek the Three Teachings.
Midnight sleep—
A sound like jingling armor,
The wind striking the bamboo mat.
Through sparse trees, I gaze at the fading clouds,
Now clinging to the pine’s highest branch.

**解佩令**
All my life, I’ve been dim-witted,
Unknowing of worldly matters.
Eating tea and rice, I forget hunger or fullness.
Sitting, I take root;
Standing, I’m like a stubborn stone in the path.
Let others laugh at my empty pretensions—
I don’t grasp letters or doctrine.
Speaking of practice, I have no words to split.
Dust clings to my face,
My beard wild, my robe patched.
Yet I’ll live forever—
No calamity will age me.

**粉蝶儿**
To recognize the elixir,
Look to your own ancestral root.
No need to count where you began.
Who shaped this mortal frame?
Who kneaded this soul’s clay?
This spark of life—
Originally, lead refined.
Now that you’re human,
You’ve claimed your own dragon-tiger essence.
Yet you still can’t grasp it.
Swallow that single gold elixir,
And you’ll escape the wheel of suffering.

**武陵春**
All things—let them go.
The familiar world fades naturally.
Snatch back the stolen leisure from the bustle,
Carry nothing on your head.
Motion or stillness—no distinction,
The Dharma-realm cannot be confined.
Free beyond things, my nature like a crystal sphere.

**拾菜娘**
*(Qiu Changchun)*
A stubborn heart must fly like the wind—
Drawn into timelessness, no thought of return.

**幸遇明师因晓了，肯教熟境再相随。**
Fortunate to meet the enlightened Master—
Now willing to guide me through the familiar world once more.

**你待东时我却西。**
When you turn east, I turn west.

**我今省悟即从伊。**
Now that I awaken, I follow only Him.

**万劫轮回皆为汝，百般魔障更因谁。**
All eons of rebirth—all for you.
A thousand obstacles—yet who is their cause?

**二郎神 小张歌，也好把、繁华勘破。**
Oh, Second Son of Heaven, Little Zhang’s song—
Even you must see through the vanity of splendor.

**速认元初真面目，把意马心猿牢锁。**
Swiftly recognize your primordial true form,
And bind the restless mind and wandering thoughts.

**百岁光阴能有几，也不可虚过。**
How few are the hundred years of life—
Do not waste them in vain.

**耳却听嘱付，仙风道骨，莫向红尘埋堕。**
Hear the Master’s instructions well:
With Daoist bearing, do not sink into the dust of the world.

**省呵。把师父亲言记着。**
Reflect—remember the Master’s words.

**你原是蓬莱洞裹仙，为思凡、人间沦落。**
You were once an immortal of Penglai’s cave,
Yet fell to mortal longing, lost in the world below.

**速整仙胎归上会，莫荏苒、俗情系缚。**
Swiftly refine your immortal essence and return to the Celestial Gathering—
Do not linger, bound by worldly affections.

**自思忖，假饶积玉堆金，终久幻化如何。**
Consider this: though you hoard jade and gold,
All will dissolve—what then remains?

**青梅引**
*(I smile at those who deceive me, untrusting.)*
**我笑迷人，不信乖劣。**
I laugh at those who lead others astray—
Unbelieving in their deceit.

**痴心恋，贪名利萦击。**
Foolish love, ensnared by fame and gain.

**落魄狂游，每将术艺养道，用安身己。**
Cast off, wandering wildly—
Daily cultivating arts to nourish the Dao,
To secure my own being.

**道知和息。**
The Dao knows peace.

**藜杖药瓢，蓑衣蛮笠。**
With gourd staff and medicine gourd,
In raincoat and straw hat.

**纵大地有满地真珠，那的直甚闲气。**
Though the earth were paved with pearls,
What use is such idle wealth?

**无限峰峦耸翠。**
Endless peaks rise in emerald splendor.

**略撰个茅庵，用做栖心，幸有灵苗裔。**
A humble thatched hut—my dwelling place,
Fortunate to have such a blessed lineage.

**更兼泉水。**
And the spring’s clear waters.

**饥渴自然无碍。**
Hunger and thirst pose no hindrance.

**独坐深山裹。**
Alone in the mountain’s depths.

**闷看乾坤间隔，望落落如晓星之势。**
Gazing at the vast expanse of Heaven and Earth,
Seeing the scattered stars like dawn’s first light.

**再遇何年，驾云朝上帝。**
When next we meet, I shall ride the clouds
To pay homage to the Celestial Sovereign.

**玉胡蝶**
*(The Butterfly of Jade)*
**捉住玉山赤凤，神舟同泛，激浪漂浮。**
Seizing the Crimson Phoenix of Jade Mountain,
Together we ride the divine boat,
Riding waves that surge and drift.

**便使乌龟开口，出头喜谟，吸洪涛、枯乾北海，使巨波、浇灌西湖。**
Even if the Tortoise speaks,
Its joyful words would drain the Northern Sea’s tides,
Pouring vast waves to flood the Western Lake.

**自舒敷。**
Spreading freely.

**水纹花面，此日是金铺。**
Ripples like floral patterns—
Today, the ground is paved with gold.

**光珠。**
Radiant orbs.

**盈盈照耀，恰如明月，晃晃方隅。**
Glowing full, like the bright moon,
Illuminating every corner.

**普徧腾辉，尽成霞彩环纡。**
Universal radiance ascends—
All becomes swirling clouds of crimson hue.

The round elixir pearl appears ever deeper,
The precious elixir formed—transcending the void.

Ascending to the Great Luo Heaven,
Ever awake, forever.

**这消息，几人知，独我全真好。**
This truth—how few know it,
Only I, the True and Complete.

With Great Awakening, the heart grows cool—
Then all becomes clear.

The original face shines eternally.

Most wondrous.

The Golden Pass opens, the Jade Gate shuts—
Flowing freely through the vital pathways.

Through the Three Fields, the upper and lower align,
Descending silver dew—yellow sprouts grow on the elixir herbs.

**姹婴舞跳。**
The maiden dances, vibrant and lively.

**透引动、龙吟虎啸。**
Stirring the Dragon’s roar and Tiger’s cry.

**般运在，斡旋中，坎离颠倒。**
The revolutions turn,
The interplay of yin and yang—
Kan and Li inverted.

**龟蛇战斗，水火抽添，炉内烧丹，结就明珠晃耀。**
The Tortoise and Serpent contend,
Water and fire blend—
Within the furnace, the elixir burns,
Forming a radiant pearl.

**玉皇深恩宣诏。**
The Jade Emperor’s profound grace is proclaimed.

**祥云攒罩。**
Auspicious clouds gather above.

At that time, steady astride the Azure Crane,
Return to Penglai Isle.

**Refining the elixir sand** *(Waves Winnowing Sand)*
**Master Ma Dan-yang**
To walk the Dao, the heart must be unyielding,
Guard the elixir field with vigilance.
Harmonize the true breath, ever flowing.
Within the twelve hours, ever present—
Do not let worldly dust entangle you.
The secret lies in avoiding clamor,
In quietude, find true repose.
Silent speech must be mastered.
When the divine elixir ripens, the Way is fulfilled,
And one ascends to the Celestial Court.

**Pointing at the Crimson Layer** *(Note: "层" likely refers to a Daoist alchemical stage or layer)*
**Master Quan Zhen**
A humble gourd—
Born naturally, wondrous in its simplicity.
Short of stature,
Yet the gourd has a mouth,
Difficult to open, hard to explain.
Recognizing Heaven and Earth—
Who can truly grasp this truth?
A belt at the waist,
The Daoist cherishes it above all,
Not exchanging it for a golden fish pouch.

**Second Verse**
Alas, all seek fame and gain,
Bound in endless cycles of greed.
When will it end?
Only when the eyes fall to the earth,
Do they finally regret.
Though children and grandchildren may follow,
They cannot bear the burden in your stead.
Tears well up—
This bitter taste,
Shatters the heart before it is known.

**Third Verse**
**Master Qiu Chang-chun**
Last night, drunken and dazed,
In intoxication, I seemed to ride the elixir phoenix.
With music and song,
I soared through the Four Heavens,
Awakening to the Peach Blossom Cavern’s depths.
Facing the deep ravine,
I leisurely played with a radiant pearl.
At dawn’s first stir,
A gust of wind carried me away—
The dream of immortality shattered.
The crane’s cry fades into silence.

**Verse (Continuation of *行香子* / *青莲池上客*)**

**Flower-lined paths and rocky peaks**—
The *Zhōnglí* bell tolls.
The Four Great Elements are void of self,
The Five Aggregates are inherently empty.
Cease to vie with others and with self,
Strutting as heroes.
Noble or base, wise or foolish—
All shall meet in the realm of dreams.
A hundred years of kin and loved ones,
Wrapped in crimson light,
Should each be bound in their own fate.

I urge you to diligently refine your practice,
Ever reflecting on the original essence.
When you come, you bring nothing,
When you go, you are void.
Human life is finite,
Yet greed spins endlessly.
Better to live within your allotted measure,
For even a spark of luminous clarity
Naturally yields moonlit breezes and pure winds.

---
**Second Verse (*Jiāngshénzǐ* / *吕洞宾*)**

Rare is the man who lives to seventy years of age.
Alas, the foolish are lost—
They do not cultivate the Dao.
Time is finite,
Yet triumph and failure hinge on right and wrong.
Worldly glory and renown are all seized,
Yet in vain—
For *karmic bonds* follow them.
Temporarily, they are bewitched by wine, song, and wealth,
Gaining but losing in the same breath.
Darkness veils their youthful bloom,
Gradually draining their *qi* and spirit.
With vigor waning and decline creeping,
Who can they blame but themselves?
How then is the Dao?
**Autumn at Qū River**—

This point, ancient and modern, is sought in confusion.
All have their allotment, yet none lack.
All because of mistaken thoughts—
Where attachment clings, there suffering arises.
If one lets go of each and every thing,
What mysteries remain?
Live in accordance with one’s measure and fate,
Uncover the original face—
This must be made clear.
Cold hearth, cold stove,
Facing tigers and dragons in song and cry.
Right before you—this is it.
No need to seek beyond.

No need to ask of gods or Buddhas,
Only shared awakening awareness.

---
**Melon Blossom Tune** — *Qiu Changchun*
Without toil in walking, without weariness in sitting.
Let me wander or rest as I please.
Morning breeze light, evening sky clear.
The Dao’s path unfettered—
South Creek flows level above and below.
East of the creek, fortunate to forget form in friendship,
Bright moon when night wine is poured.
The cup pauses, moonlight pure.
Unfastening my robe, hair unbound,
Joyfully singing of the Way.

---
**Ascending Flower** — *Wu Zhenren*
The restless mind locked away,
Awakening to dust and time’s swift flight—
A hundred years pass in an instant.
Begin practice now—
The original true spirit must dwell here today.
At home in pits and trenches,
First leap free from the self,
Making solitude your host.
Stillness without disturbance.
Wealth, desire, color, wine—
All must be abandoned.
Cutting off all worldly attachments,
Even father, mother, wife, and kin.
Free and unbound,
Fallen into carefree ease,
Recognize the gold and jade wrapped in rags.
The flower’s heart stirs,
Scent filling the air.
Strange light clusters,
Auspicious radiance gleams,
Forming celestial melodies.

---
**Step of the Moon Palace** — *Lü Dongbin*
Kan, Li, Zhen, Dui, and Zi-Wu aligned—
Recognize your own ancestral roots.
Earth-thunder resounds,
Shaking rain from mountain peaks.
Gradually nourishing,
Yellow sprouts break from the soil.
Seizing golden essence, firmly sealed.
Refining the elixir—
Taming dragons and tigers.
If asked who transmits this,
Only say: *My surname is Lü.*

---
**Double Swallows** — *Qiu Changchun*
Spring mist drifts faintly,
Green hills charming, wandering clouds scattered in the void.
Flower-light and stone-moisture reveal
Strange wonders of the immortal realm.
Windows and doors rise a thousand zhang—
All senses revel in wind’s swift joy.
Lifetimes of suffering and dusty passions,
Now boundless and pure—no trace of the mundane.
Worthy of love.
Free and unbound,
Shedding shackles, free of karmic debt.
Wind as companion, ears attuned,
Dao in harmony with crystal heavens.
Endless towering peaks—
All bestowed upon the mountain hall’s teachings.
Thousand-vehicle pearls—
Who can pay the price?

---
**No Worries to Dissolve** — *San Yu Zhenren*
From ancient times to now,
Many sorrows, few joys—
Pure simplicity and peace are rare.
Fortunate to meet sages in the world.
Proclaiming Dao and discussing the *Luòtiān*,
True immortals descending from above.
Ruling all under heaven without toil,
Inner and outer cease war, embrace culture,
Honor the worthy, cherish virtue,
Bringing clear peace and blessings.
How then repay Heaven’s grace?
Wasting fine moments in triviality.
First uphold frugality,
Ensure warmth and fullness—
No greed for fame or gain.
Seek Dao’s mysteries in the Mysterious Gate.
Abandon desires, preserve harmonious *qi*.
Further, let go—
Each thought, each thing—
Only then escape human burdens.

---
**Wooden Lantern Slow** —
Light and pure, my essence refined,
Alone with Heaven in boundless play.
Yet bound in mortal flesh,
Encircled by the Five Phases,
Trapped by the Four Great Elements.
All years spent in delusion, unaware,
Clinging to illusions of sound and color.
The original immortal realm—
So near, yet distant as heaven and earth.
To seek return to the root, restore the origin,
Only the heart must decide.
Silently focus the essence,
Always probing, seeking—
Surely the work will be complete.
Suddenly, emptiness shatters,
All lifetimes’ karmic barriers vanish.
Shaking sleeves, bound for Penglai and Kunlun,
No fear of weak waters without a boat.
At leisure in intoxication,
Leaning against green mountains.
Awake, plucking the jade zither,
Playing *Hèwū* of the Nine Marshes.
Water clear, mountains near,
Serene and free in joy.
I too return to Kunlun’s halls,
Ascend Penglai’s isle.
Thus, for now, dwelling among mortals,
With Creation, wandering the Great Void,
Nurturing form and spirit—
Both perfectly preserved.

---
**Upper Flat Western Tune**
This *wu-chang* (impermanence),
Two characters—most difficult to guard.
When it comes, no place to hide.
No matter old or young,
Poor or rich, virtuous or base.
No matter wife or child,
How can one cling to parents?
Body returns to earth, blood to water,
Soul and breath scatter with the wind.
Look closely—
How could one not grieve?
Do not covet the fire hall,
Early cultivate the heavenly realm.
Three thousand merits fulfilled, bound for Penglai,
Forever in the immortal land.

---
**Second Verse**
The same.

**First Verse**
Summoning the clear breeze, inviting the bright moon—
Come and go, as one pleases.
Reflecting on how much
Idle chatter is idle folly.
Facing mountains, near waters,
Close to pines and bamboo, near plum blossoms.
In the modest courtyard, few daily tasks—
Poetry, wine, the zither, and chess.
No entanglements, no vexations,
No partings.
Awaiting transformation,
Ever in simple foolishness.
Mosquito’s bite, snail’s horn—
Gains and losses—
What more is there to do?
Better to hear the true essence of early joy,
Lying high on the clouded stairs.

---
**Second Verse**
*(Chou Changchun)*
The sun and moon revolve without end.
Spring departs, autumn arrives—
How many flourishings and decays!
Five Emperors, Three Sovereigns, countless ages—
Each rise and fall is thus.
Death and birth, birth and death again.
Endless cycles of change—
When will they cease?
Only when reaching the heartless resting place
Can one attain true stillness beyond all else.

---
**Third Verse**
*(Bai Yuzhen)*
Green fades, red thins—spring is gone.
Swallows carry mud,
Flying into the weeping willows.
Willow fluff lingers, but the wind won’t stop;
Cuckoos cry endlessly through the mountains.
With bamboo staff and straw sandals, no fixed abode.
Fine groves and streams—
Trusting my feet to guide my path.
How much of this heart’s stirrings?
A river’s wind and moon—who rules them?

---
**Fourth Verse**
*(Chou Changchun)*
The golden rooster turns westward to greet the Jade Emperor.
Eastward, the silver hare glows,
Its radiance veiling the green osmanthus.
Gradually, the South Hua gathering of chrysanthemums begins,
Filled with wine from the Northern Sea—drunk, utterly drunk.
Drunkenly reclining in the Zhongnan Mountains’ hues,
Mountain colors pure and high, night unclouded.
Not a crow’s cry—only the wind grows fine,
Moonlight bright as day, sky like water.

---
**Fifth Verse**
A secluded, rugged peak—pure and clear.
Carving jade for dwelling, embracing the Way without knowing or understanding.
Dao companions look at each other—do not be surprised.
Poverty and simplicity, no pretenses.
Wealth, honor, and fame—rely on them?
Many gains are many losses—
Gradually, excess leads to ruin.
Rich feasts and fragrant meats cannot be endured,
But coarse rice and water bring lasting peace.

---
**Sixth Verse**
When fortune comes, rest while you can—
That is rest.
Winning true ease,
Let the hare lead your mind and body.
How many clever and heroic souls
Busy themselves, squandering their lives’ purpose.
Creation shifts without end.
Yesterday’s joy, today’s sorrow.
Today unknown, tomorrow’s fate—
Why weary the mind over such trifles?

---
**Seventh Verse**
Today, I ponder yesterday’s old self.
Knowing my path ahead,
So distant, so hard to cross.
Fortune does not linger, Heaven offers no aid—
Hastening away, no way to stay.
Now, a walking corpse, I’ve awakened.
My spirit drifts—
For now, dwell by the Pan Stream.
To my neighbors, noble and common alike,
Often I am remembered.

---
**Song of the Incense Offering**
A single fly,
Into a bloody basin.
When it tastes the sweetness,
Straight to the heart it goes,
Forgetting to lift itself.
Stained its feet, stained its wings—
Lost its form.
How I sigh—
How could it not move me?
Sweetness hides bitterness,
Fortune breeds disaster.
Once knowing the taste,
Better to withdraw.
You are so blind,
So foolish—
A great, fat fly.

---
**Peony in the Rain**
*(Wang Chongyang)*
How much wine for the Double-Ninth Feast—
Through it, the Dao’s mysteries unfold.
A coarse hemp robe, a blue cloth cap.
Well-made, truly well-made—
A spirit truly refined.

**Song of the Pillow Screen**
No need for mirrors to reflect—
All things are clear within the mind.
In dreams, one recognizes the dream-self.
This is true freedom—
The one who reaches the other shore.

**Boat on the River**
Traversed famous mountains,
All peaks and ridges passed through.
Climbing high slopes,
Ascending steep ridges—
Why weary the spirit?
The Way is within the body,
Yet the mind clings to things,
Entangled, evading.
Never losing
The original self.

Day and night we walk together,
At dusk, we sleep and rest as one.
Till dawn, we follow as before,
Together walking, together seated.
Suddenly—
In an instant—
It becomes clear:
You are my elder brother.

---

**Divination of Fate**
*(Sun Xiangu)*
Firmly grasping robes, awaiting the hour,
Water and fire intertwine.
A million hues of light rise from the ocean’s depths,
Piercing the Three Passes in a single column.
Celestial music plays without cease,
Ever drinking the nectar of enlightenment.
Wondrous elixirs manifest in an instant—
The Nine-Turn Golden Elixir complete.

---

**Joyous Departure**
*(Qiu Changchun)*
To leave birth and death behind.

**First Verse**
Discard all old habits, grinding them down from the start.
A thousand layers of desire—
Body and mind refined a hundred times,
Forged into an iron will of one inch.

Release the Six Spirits, harmonious and unmoved,
The Three Corpses stumble in confusion.
Act with fierce resolve.
Rely on the boundless void,
Unfeeling and undivided.
The knot is bound—
The shackles are cast off.
Only then does one meet the True Person,
Whose golden mouth transmits the subtle secret.
Instantly, the spirit wind blows away the demonic barrier,
The form becomes like carved wood or molded clay.
Having obtained the Nature-Pearl,
The Heavenly Treasure is pierced through—
Spring flowers, autumn moons.
At that time—
Ghosts cannot call out;
Only the Immortals guide and lift.

**Second Verse**
Disgusted with worldly filth,
One takes delight in emptiness and ease,
Making purity a companion.
The sword gleams with cold light,
Weapons rest beneath cloud-generals,
Victorious over the Five Phases’ marauders.
The Cavernous Mysteries’ treasure is secured,
Escaping the shell of yin and yang.
The Great Elixir is complete.
Refining and plucking the sun and moon,
Caressing stars and constellations—
Outstanding and peerless.
Surpassing past and future,
Responding to myriad affairs with manifest divine power.
An iron gate stands firm,
Golden needles and jade threads—
Piercing through seven and eight layers everywhere.
Summoning the embroidered qilin and lions,
Awakening waterfowl and mountain beasts.
Swiftly turning back,
Toward the Azure Peak’s embrace,
Sleeping high in the pure daylight.

**Third Verse**
Do not seek the arcane mysteries.

I have made clear the keys to cultivation—
Fight the enemy of slumber, forget desire and sever thought—
This is the true teaching of sages.

Eat and drink to still doubt,
Diligently cultivate awareness each day.
Do not err.

Wait until there is neither sleep nor waking,
Then the heart aligns with the Dao.

There are profound harmonies and marvels—
Refining qi into spirit yields a golden radiance.
The Five Qi ascend to the Primordial,
The Three Flowers gather at the crown,
Water and fire circulate in reverse.

The Nine Suns coalesce into the Elixir of Return,
Piercing the Soul’s Platform to its eight extremes.
The work is complete.

On the path to longevity, leisurely wandering the Three Isles.

**Fourth Verse**
To regulate true breath—
Discuss the root source, attaining its living reality.
Qi is the heart’s essence,
Spirit governs qi—when the heart stirs, spirit and qi separate.
When the heart is tranquil, yin and yang embrace,
Mind settled, true essence forms naturally.
Do not mistake it.

This inner breath-regulation
Is not about artificial contortions—
Ignorant of the Embryonic Origin’s principle.
Open eyes, nose, and fingers—
The Spirit Tortoise and Serpent play.
Following the Dao’s ancestral tradition,
Returning light to its source,
Breath naturally returns to its root.
A clean breeze suddenly passes through the door,
Water and fire instantly complete their cycle.

At this stage,
True constancy is within arm’s reach—
A Three-Life Buddha manifests in the world.

**Fifth Verse**
Returning to the dusty world,
Break free from entanglements—
How long can one roam untrammled?
Coarse robes and simple headbands,
Patched garments and frayed tails—
This is the way home.

Asked why I hide,
I point to the pine and moss’s verdant shade.
Wrapped in Azure Mist,
There are monkeys and cranes of the Lake of Heaven,
Friends who know the heart’s intent.
Unmatched.
Leisure is noble.
Resting on Laozi and Zhuangzi’s wisdom,
Not coveting noble titles.
Water trousers and mountain sandals,
Rain cloaks and moon flutes—
A distinct flavor of refinement.

How to obtain such news?
Since ancient times, the lineage of immortals.
Fulfilling my purpose,
I let the shifting lands transform,
Life’s rise and fall pass by.

**Sixth Verse**
With myriad ties released,
I wander with staff and sandals,
Through fields and neighbors’ homes.
Rain hat and wind cloak,
Quail robes and crane bones—
Hiding in the jade-green peaks’ shade.
Worldly turmoil fills the eye,
Yet beyond it, the Dao’s mystery reigns supreme.

The virtue’s wind spreads,
Delighting in purity and tranquility,
Without striving in the world’s affairs.
Serene and refined,
Riding clouds and cranes,
Returning to my ancestral home,
Where swallows and orioles sing of Wang and Xie’s glory.
Pure waters and rocks,
Deep valleys and distant peaks—
Above the dust of noble carriages.
A thousand years of praise and blame,
Success and failure—
All dissolved in a nap of mist and river wilds.

Wonderful!
This life I would sell—
Who could pay its price?

**Seventh Verse**
Cast aside fame and gain.

**Eighth Verse**
Entering the vast lands of **Guangmo**’s village,
I meander with ease, winding and turning.
By winding streams and mountain barriers,
In misty hamlets and cloud-draped dwellings,
I wear simple hemp-cloth and humble herbs—
What need have I of jade halls and lofty caps?
My aspirations are boundless.

To the eastern fence, I while away my days,
In the western garden, I chant and sip.
Endless and far-reaching—
I do nothing, yet live in harmony.
If no kindred soul appears,
Where shall I speak of the Dao’s subtleties?

Books and zithers, stone altars and clay cauldrons—
Beyond these, no true joy exists.
Refined and serene, my demeanor flows like wind,
Yet who now bears witness to my radiance?

I seek my own peace.
A pine by the stream, a moon in the wilds,
A thousand years of monkeys and cranes.

**Ninth Verse**
Cutting off all worldly attachments,
I awaken from the dream of toil—
Like a quail dwelling in a thatched hut.
Feeding ants, roasting fowl,
In dusty robes and wind-worn caps,
I’ve won a hundred years of idle waste.

Gain is like fading mist and fleeting light,
Fame like fallen petals and scattered threads.
How could it endure?

Like a candle in the wind, or dew on a branch—
Who understands?

Alone, I return.
Gathering the waters and clouds,
I lie high on the **Caoxi** path.
Beyond the bamboo, the spring’s flow,
By the fence, wild chrysanthemums,
And the scattered blossoms of the wild crabapple—
All idle pleasures.

Before the Five-Pine Fence, I drink and recite,
With one laugh, transcending the ages.
I wish to impart this wisdom—
Yet sigh at the misty waves’ vastness,
Where are the true listeners?

**Water Dragon Song**
From the jade incense burner, a hundred devout breaths rise,
A single stick of faith-inspiring fragrance,
Swirling and ascending.
Revolving and weaving,
They form a canopy of glory.
Repaying the heavens and the earth.

Encompassing grace.

Repay the virtue/power of the sun and moon’s illumination,
Repay the king’s land and water, for abundance and joy,
Repay the love and care of parents.
Above, I thank the venerable ancestors and their sacred teachings,
The Master of Dan Yang for transmitting the lineage.

Universal salvation in the dusty world,
The Complete Reality Dao/Way endures eternally.
Master Qiu [Zhang] once dwelled in Ninghai.
Together, the three of us secretly harmonized with the Dharma-realm.

May the king reign ten thousand years,
And loyal ministers serve through a thousand autumns—
I invite the disciples to bow in reverence.

---
**Second [Song] #6**
Counting the fleeting world’s ceaseless rush,
Competing for desires, weary of vexations.
Six dynasties, five tyrants,
Three kingdoms, seven states—
Eastward and westward campaigns.
Where now are the martial strategies?
Only desolation remains—wildflowers and fragrant grasses.

Lament the profound schemes and far-sighted plans,
The mighty hearts and bold qi—
All faded, now ashen and withered.
Treading the ancient paths of Chang’an.

Ask the aged remnants of the outskirts:
The Tang palaces, Han gardens,
Qin walls, Zhou ramparts—
All now overgrown with fragrant grasses.

Seeing the old sites, lingering with longing,
Yet former companions have scattered—
No word of them remains.
Reflecting on life’s brief span—
From dawn to dusk—
Heaven and earth endure, yet who can guarantee anything?

**#4**
*[Night’s Clear]* The sky’s vastness breaks the chill,
A pale, translucent heaven—like emerald glass, pure and bright.
No shade beneath the trees,
In Chang’an’s towers, the moon glows soft, the breeze fine.

A hundred calamities fade unseen,
Ten thousand households share the joy,
All partake in one crisp delight.
Behold the golden—

Stars gleam, clear and bold,
The Milky Way stands firm and wide,
Their light converges, filling earth and heaven.
Flowing through the sapphire expanse like water’s grace.

Unbounded, free to roam,
No pause, no halt—
Crashing mountains, sweeping seas,
Light cascades, radiant and unbounded,
Endless blessings pour forth, pure and bright.

From this moment, all is known:
The Celestial Vessel stands firm,
Jade nectar flows like mud.
My heart’s longing seeks a voice,
Yet who could ever understand?
Let me be lost in blissful intoxication.

---

**#5**
*[Dawn’s Clarity]* The boundless chaos opens in the Southern Peak,
Auspicious clouds emerge from Kunlun’s heights.
Stars shift, lightning flashes,
Shadows rise, light descends—
A crimson glow, faint yet vast.

Cranes dance, phoenixes soar,
Watch the tortoise and dragon coil in harmony.
All of Hongmeng’s breath,
Boiled into Creation’s grand design,
The Dao of immortals—
Instantly revealed.

Ten thousand worlds scatter the Three Isles.
The Celestial Cavern deepens—
Moonlit, winds curl with elegance.
At this hour, I grasp the gate to eternal life,
Long years of vigor, perfect attunement.

Let others sing of change—
Mountains shift, seas transform,
Stones wither, pines age,
While I alone consort with mist and clouds,
Beyond the realm of strife,
Yet grieve for few who truly know.

---

**#6**
I was born to leave the dusty world,
No longer coveting mortal splendor’s fleeting allure.
Disheveled hair, face stained with grime,
All day alone, my inner work refined.
In ancient temples, treasures wrapped in silence,
Let the red wheel sink westward.

The void is known as presence,
White as black—I guard in stillness,
Endless threads of thought unwind,
Silent harmony, my breath attuned.
No cares cling to my heart.

With a satchel at my side,
A staff to lean upon,
Grass sandals, short robes,
Worn legs, sheepskin for cover.
Hunger leads me to beg at doors,
Sated, I hum—*la li la li*—
Let others mock me, fool or sluggard,
Who could ever truly see?

*[Auspicious Crane, Immortal’s Song]*
A hundred years like dreams of butterflies.
Lament the past and present—
How many heroes once aspired to rule,
Yet now are but tales for fishermen and hunters, idle chatter.

Qin palaces, Han gates—
Now only fox trails, rabbit dens.
Remembering splendor’s hollow glow:
Wealth like hot water on snow.
Reflect—

Greed harms the body, profits none,
Empty fame like Wu Yue’s fleeting states.
Follow fate’s guidance, nurture my simplicity.
The gate closed, strife abandoned.
At noon, my knees rest by the window,
A small stream for my fishing line,
Seated before peaks piled in endless layers.

At night, the zither joins me,
With those who truly understand—
Jade sky, silver moon.
The rooster crows, the wooden horse neighs in the wind,
Yet I remain unchanged.

**[The Stone Man Nods, the Mute Speaks]**
A stone man nods in assent,
A mute speaks clearly.
A blue-eyed barbarian monk
Points to the heavens with no hands—
Draws a circle.
No truth to convey.

Let wild passions rage as they will,
Like water spilling from a shattered jar.
In vain do craftsmen toil,
Grinding tiles to polish.
Why contrive such schemes?
To outdo others in rivalry.

Armor laid aside, war’s end—
The Four Quarters in lasting peace.
No need for Zen meditation,
No quest for immortals.
Pure as clarified butter,
I know its natural state.

No step need be moved to reach the Western Paradise.
A wooden man bars the way,
But the iron ox is led along.
Fire wraps a lotus in birth—
The Dao beyond the Dao.

Clouds gather, the moon swells full.
A stone maiden stops her loom,
Her golden needle piercing thread.
Thank you, Third Brother,
Grant me your fishing boat.

Gilded scales gleam in armor,
Red brocade ever more vibrant.
No waves disturb—
I float and sink as nature wills.
Self-satisfied,
I forget the net.

Who dares scatter these tidings?
*[Dreaming of Immortals]*
**Chou Changchun**

*Dreaming of Immortals*
Plainly, I have passed through the Ninefold Heavens.
My **qi** vast and refined,
Piercing white clouds, boundless and ethereal.
Like the **Daode** Assembly at dawn—
Golden boys and jade girls descend to proclaim.

Then all sages gathered,
The Great Bright Light encasing the golden lotus.
Immortal hymns resounded,
Celestial realms rejoiced—
All forgot speech in delight.
Nectar flowed in cups,
Peach clusters feasted upon,
Each lingering in turn.

All wielded **virtue/power** and authority.
Their **spiritual powers** free,
Ages could not displace them.
Before the **Primordial Void**, boundless,
Heaven’s limits nonexistent—
The **Emperor of Forms**’s first emanation.
Piercing the **Ultimate Mysteries**.

My carriage drifts in mist,
My spirit soars through fire,
A million miles in spiraling flight.
The Four Extremes, above and below,
The Eight Directions—
No need to whip the **Luan** and **He** cranes.

When called, I arrive at the hour,
No obstacles—
Roots of my own accord.
I’ve seen all of **Qingdu**’s crimson gates,
Crossed **Yingzhou** and **Zifu** Palace—
No pen can capture it.

At **Youtai** and **Langyuan**’s flowered halls,
Auspicious clouds cast their light,
A hundred harmonies in the fragrant breeze.
Spring’s endless day, eternal warmth—
Everywhere, I feel at ease.

Reflecting on **karma**,
A single spark suffices to perfect it.
Merged with the **Primordial Void**,
Great calamities stretch on forever.
Let the **Jinding** world crumble,
Mountains collapse into caves,
Seas turn to mulberry fields—

*Spring in the Brocade Hall*
Speak of my deepest heart.

Awakening to **Nanguo**’s dream—
A fleeting vision, roots like yellow dust.
Shattering **luxury’s** allure,
Clouds bestow **plainness**,
Recognizing the **lineage’s** truth—
Light returns to its source.
With wisdom’s blade,
I sever the net of attachment,
And with my **li** staff,
I smash the dusty world.

There we meet again,
At **Emamei**’s slopes,
Hiding my radiance, swift as lightning,
Beside **Donghua** Mountain.
Hidden in groves and streams,
Southern **Chen** and Northern **Dou**,
Sun and moon tucked in my sleeves.
My face ageless,
Though heaven shatters and earth collapses—
My true nature remains unchanged.

Dancing in my sleeves,
I scorn the narrowness of **Qiankun**,
Only spreading my hands—
Heaven and earth measured equally.
Drunk with joy,
My sack holds the four seas,
Laughing with delight,
My belly stores the three rivers.

How many times at **Youtai**’s feast,
The **Longevity Peach**’s gatherings—
Immortal banquets, cups raised to the clouds.
**Zhuli** arrives,
The Jade Emperor hosts the feast—
Without me, it cannot proceed.
The **Double-Ninth Festival**,
Seven golden lotuses bloom,
Their divine light radiant as one.

*[The Living Skull]*

The reckoning of life’s vanity—what grand wind flows here?
Clad in robes to shield the form, yet squandering the spirit,
Wasting years in hollow toil.
No thought of impermanence’s approach,
No dread of **Yanlao’s** summons to depart.
Cunningly contriving schemes,
Busy with schemes of greed—
Endless strife, yet bound in suffering.
Empty bustle, fleeting fame, thin gains—
Only more idle sorrow to provoke.
A breath of three inches—
Once severed, lone on barren hills I lie.
Sighing through ages, rise and fall—
Time flees swift, cannot be stayed.
How fine to drift free, refine the nature,
Cast aside past arrogance.
Lay down dusty toil,
Awaken to the heart’s true light—
Soaring on winds, wild clouds gathered in.
Mountains still, the **Taixu** vast and empty,
Stars and moon illuminating **Yingzhou**.
Truly bliss—
Unbounded joy, no envy of kings.

*[The Sleep Demon King]*
A hundred harms he brings, a thousand calamities.
By day, he still may lurk—
By night, no place to hide.
He vexes men to stupor, drunk as fools,
Undermines practice, squanders life’s brief span.
Eyes glued shut, head crushed like a mountain’s weight,
A fog of dullness, frail and weak.
He lures the **Three Corpses, Six Bandits**,
Steals **yuanqi** in dreams’ embrace.
Endless his tricks—
Soaring through **Dharmadhatu**, wild and mad.
Thus, without cause, so perverse—
I urge all: guard yourselves with care.
Mind death’s path, the great affair ahead—
Protect the **Three Lights** with earnestness.
No leaning on others—
Awakening alone, fierce as **Guan Yu and Zhang Fei**.
They clash in battle,
Sharp as blades, unyielding—
One mind presses forward.
Chased away, clouds disperse, mists fade,
Cool and clear.

---
**Ma Dan yang** swears this oath,
Burning the vow in solemn pledge.
First, uphold the law of the land.
Seeing men and women, parents alike,
I renounce **qi, wealth, wine, and lust**,
Abandon glory, shun the tainted.
Ever pure, ever humble, reverent,
No factions, no bias.
In coarse robes, I beg my daily bread,
Hunger and cold—then stretch my hand in the street.
No greed for wealth, no boastful lies,
No feigning wisdom as a fraud.
Always mind the end as the beginning,
In peril, stand firm.
Should I stray from the Dao,
May my body split a thousand times,
Forever sunk in **Yellow Springs**.

---
*[For the Practitioner]*
The Daoist does not dwell in mountains,
Nor toil in endless rounds of **kneeling and bowing**.
Why cling to petty comings and goings,
Far journeys to seek the master?
No need for seated meditation,
Nor laboring, planting for food.
No need for bitter herbs,
To trade for robes and rice.
Where do you fix your mind?
Only this: no trace of defilement—
Break free from all such bonds.
Better to beg in the marketplace,
Gathering scraps and leftovers.
Asking after hollow fame and gain—
Sigh, death’s shadow darkens the heart.
Forgotten dust, forgotten thoughts—
Let future ranks among immortals be.
---
*[Shu Kui Flower]*
---
**Wang Chongyang** transmits the secret precepts:
Only when dusty passions fade.
Tame the **horse of desire**, the **monkey-mind**,
Lock them tight—let none escape.
Banish stinginess, strife, delusion—
Cut the roots of **self and others**.
Guard your cleverness, guard your wisdom—
Let them grow dull.
The **Purple Palace’s** Lord rests.
The **Treasure Cauldron’s** cinnabar seals.
No need to speak of **Dragon and Tiger**,
Of **lead and mercury’s** tangled threads.
From the **Misty Clouds’** pile,
A single wheel of moon is lifted.
Now the **Xiyu** lineage stands apart.

*The Daoist Realm: [The Gathering from Panxi]*
*[Shu Kui Flower]* is rendered as *"Fine Grass and Mustard Seed"* in the original.

This poem is likely a **zaju** [散曲 *zǎnqǔ*—a form of Chinese dramatic song, often secular], though its meter requires further study.

The following six **yuefu** [词 *cí*—lyric poems] under the title *"Phoenix Nesting in the Willow"* [凤栖梧 *Fèng Qī Wú*]:
With the exception of the second poem, which appears in *The Poems of Master Yǔchán* [玉蟾先生诗余 *Yùchuán Xiānsheng Shīyú*],
the remaining five are attributed to **Qiu Chúji** [丘处机 *Qiū Chǔjī*—a prominent figure in the **Quanzhen** *全真* **Daoist school**], also found in *The Gathering from Panxi* [磻溪集 *Pánxī Jí*] and *The Journey to the West* [西游记 *Xīyóu Jì*].

The original misattributed the **yuefu** title as *"Nán Xiāngzǐ"* [南香子 *Nán Xiāngzǐ*—a Southern tune], but it should be the **Southern tune double-meter** *"Xíng Xiāngzǐ"* [行香子 *Xíng Xiāngzǐ*—*Walking in Fragrance*].

The original lacks an author’s signature, but this poem also appears in *The Complete Quanzhen Lyrics of Zhòngyáng* [重阳全真集 *Zhòngyáng Quánzhēn Jí*] Volume Five.

The original lacks an author’s signature. The following four poems—all under the title *"Water Dragon’s Roar"* [水龙吟 *Shuǐlóngyín*],—are also found in *The Gathering from Panxi* and are by **Qiu Chúji**.

In *The Gathering from Panxi*, these three lines read:
*"Táng Cháo Hànshì, Qín Guān Zhōu Yuàn, Míngmíng Jiàn Gào"* [唐朝汉市，秦官周苑，明明见告].

*The Sixth Volume of Daoist Play at Xiānyóu Shān*
Collected by **Daoist Master Péng Zhìzhōng** [仙游山道士彭致中 *Xiānyóu Shān Dàoshì Péng Zhìzhōng*] of **Xiānyóu Shān**.

**Eight Modes of *Gānzhōu* [甘州]**
*(Attributed to Hé Xiāngū [何仙姑])*

Thousands of gates and halls—
All toppled seven times eight,
Digging earth to seek the sky.
Truly wondrous, yet reduced to childish babble.
The Daoist of Non-Action walks few paths,
Yet along the way of strange encounters,
A thousand sorrows accumulate.
The dung-beetle’s ball becomes an elixir.
Helpless in grief, yet none know the cause—
In vain, family ties are cast aside.
Time is pure and still—
How could it grasp the alchemy of mercury and lead?
Thoughts and schemes never cease—
Even in sleep, the shadow-demons cling.
The more one turns, the deeper the sorrow—
Revenge becomes the cycle.
Who would believe in the birth of nothingness,
And nothingness giving rise to all?
All streams return to their source.

---
**The Second [Section]**
A cluster of spring snow,
Cast into a jade furnace to boil.
Fires blaze without ceasing—
Burn until it glows red, without flame or smoke.
Mindful not to lose a grain—
The weight remains unchanged.
Thus, three thousand [times].
Only when refined to immobility,
Can it be called Zen.
Nurturing True Life lies here—
Between these very breaths.
The garden holds its own sweet dew.
To nourish the golden sprout,
That the rare lotus may bloom.
In seclusion, await the coming—
To stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Immortals.

---
**Treading Snow [踏雪行]**
Piercing antiquity, mastering the present,
Clarifying scripture, resolving meaning.
Endless debates make the heavens fall.
Chasing painted bread to sate hunger—
Bamboo shadows cannot sweep the hall’s dust.
Few desires, few thoughts—
Silent joy, beyond words.
All schools struggle to let go—
If one departs from this inch of mind,
Even iron shoes would be trod to no avail.

---
**Willow Leaf Green [柳梢青]**
Faintly, the morning star flickers.
White dew on withered moss,
Ruined walls of an ancient site—
Pale smoke, fading grass,
The Han dynasty’s palaces.
On Chang’an’s thoroughfare, travelers still
Pursue fame and profit as before.
Youth fades, ancient and modern alike—
A sliver of moon over the pass.

---
**The Second [Section]**
Awakening to neither birth nor death—
Not even a flower plucked, a leaf taken.
When inspired, sing aloud,
Drunkenly sleep on fragrant grass,
Dreaming of celestial halls.
Sometimes, bitterly admonishing all—
Do not, I implore you, heed my warnings.
Walking like a hollow corpse,
Greed turns the face ashen—
Wasting years in vain.

---
**Plum Blossom Tune [梅花引]**
Old Master of the Fragrant Peaks,
Grew white-haired early.
In mortal life, both good and evil were wrought.
Poverty and wealth—both known.
Gain and loss, rise and fall—
All like a dream within a dream.
Because of poverty, the body bears no shame;
Because of leisure, the heart knows no burden.
Do not seek high talent,
Do not seek high name.
Talent and fame bring only laborious turns.
Know little of affairs—
Fewer are the vexations.
When the heart forgets and the belly burns—
When will this end?
Do not lift the eyes,
Do not open the mouth.
Endless strife—
How can one escape it?
Coming alone, going alone, no companion.
Pouring alone, drinking alone—
No honor, no disgrace.
Let others slander, let others suspect.
A tranquil heart knows
The clear wind and bright moon.

---
**Gazing at the Plum Blossom [望梅花]**
Life and death are the greatest trials of the self.
From the start, they have harmed me.

**Hunger drives me to seek food,
Thirst compels me to beg for drink,
Cold brings me to search for robes and coverings—
How hard it is to endure!
Day and night they follow me,
Plaguing me beyond measure.

Abandoning my mother-given fleshly vessel,
I entrust myself to the care of the two families of ease.
When I walk, I pierce the clouds;
When weary, I rest beneath the moon,
Playing freely in the boundless void—
How light and swift!

Seizing the wind-wheel,
Straddling the divine tortoise,
I traverse all realms without hindrance.

**Second Stanza:**
Cease debating right and wrong—
The weak will see their truth in time.
Do not blame others,
Nor deceive yourself—
The hidden sage reveals himself.
Hear my counsel:
From ancient times to now,
Not a single thing has been spared.
Sweep away the dust of entanglements—
Pure and unchanging from beginning to end.
Though rooted deep,
Long life and eternal vision
Cannot escape the fleeting beauty of youth.
Refine qi and spirit—
When you meet a kindred soul,
Share the mysteries of the *Xi Yi*—
Reveal all.

**Third Stanza:**
Thick crimson clouds shroud the earth.
A gusting wind from the north arises—
The Great Block breathes,
Yang congeals, yin coalesces,
And jade flowers bloom across the four wilds in omens.
Such intentions—
The sage feels the abundance of the year,
Manifesting the Tang and Yu eras once more,
A world restored to order.
Reverence the Dao, honor Confucius, cultivate righteousness,
Cherish the Three Teachings as one body.
Filial sons and virtuous grandsons,
Loyal ministers and upright courts—
Harmony flows from top to bottom.
Within the sacred cauldron,
Incense burns bright,
Praying for the emperor’s longevity—
May his reign last ten thousand years.

**Fourth Stanza:**
The sun lingers at the southern window,
Still I sleep.

**Fifth Stanza:**
Beyond the sparse bamboo grove, the thatched gate stays shut.
Suddenly, someone arrives—
Lightly knocking at the door,
I barely turn, too lazy to rise.
Just as sweetness deepens—
A taste so dark and intoxicating,
Asking in the world—
What could compare?
Only deep, drunken oblivion
Forgets the startling fear,
Forgets the fall—
Neither rising nor falling known,
Life and death alike,
One with heaven and earth.
Such meaning—
Hard to grasp,
Yet like a mute solving a riddle.

**Sixth Stanza:**
Do not judge others’ flaws.
Search your own faults,
Lest you stir chaos yourself.
The old heart-monkey,
The wild intent-horse—
Now awakened,
Gradually tamed by restraint.
Still the mind within,
Refining to purity and balance,
Transforming the mortal frame.
When matters arise, decide swiftly—
Even immortals have no other method.
Through ages unending,
With an empty heart and full belly,
The wise strategist needs no calculations.
When merit is complete,
Riding a cloud of blessing,
You ascend to the Celestial Court,
Dwelling in the Hall of the Immortal.

**Seventh Stanza:**
A hundred years of youth pass like lightning.
In vain to look back—
Another cycle comes.
Selling bones for return,
Through countless lives and deaths,
Only changing faces.
To escape—
Seize the clear wind,
Turning the void into a single expanse.
No need to chant the *Chuang-tzu* scriptures,
Nor cling to entanglements.
Sever the midstream,
Pierce the heart’s core,
Shooting through jade halls and golden palaces.
Do not falter—
With unwavering resolve,
Watch as the moon rises over the peaks.
The needle stops—
*Sanfeng*’s True Person says the Dao is hard to speak.
To awaken, understand each layer,
Until all is clear.

**Continuation:**

Pierce through with luminous clarity,
Returning radiance to its source—
No need to pluck flowers or leaves.
Movement spawns distinction.
Cease all grasping thoughts,
Lest tangled branches grow.
In its original form,
Pure and unadorned,
What need for words?

Only fierce resolve will suffice.
With wisdom’s blade drawn,
Cut like iron—unrelenting.
Shatter the mountain of affection,
Leap from the sea of love,
Break the void’s false repose.

Qi and spirit rejoice.
Cultivate the Nine Suns,
Refining into crimson snow.
Wrapped in rainbow hues,
A single offering—
A moon of pristine whiteness.

**Acclamation to the Sacred Reign#1**
*(Attributed to Qiu Changchun)*

When the sun sinks low,
The plains gather its last glow,
The willow locks in cold mist.
Facing the southern stream,
Alone I sit, drifting with the wind’s breath,
Listening to the cascading spring.
Through endless night,
Forgetting all affairs,
My idle nature hums—
The zither plays without strings.

Await the time when the Azure Crow descends from the clouds,
To prove the earthly immortal’s truth.

**Second Stanza:**
After the wild monk departs,
The fisherman’s boat ties to shore,
Green pines rise in mist.
Before the cold lamp’s flicker,
I toss aside books and sleep,
Listening to the stones rinse the spring.
The alchemical furnace cools,
The zither hall falls silent—
The wind-tunes the strings.

Await the moment when the lone peak’s moon shines bright,
When the Zhengyi adept dreams of transcendence.

**Song of the Incense Offering**
Silent, boundless, vast—#2

**First Stanza:**
Wine spills in a light drizzle.
A faint life—
One taste of unbounded ease.
Beside the valley’s mouth,
Leaning askew on the mountain’s flank.
A bamboo fence gates the door,
A broom of wild jasmine,
A grass wad for a marker.
A coarse hemp robe, loose and wide,
Its sash long and trailing.
A gnarled staff—
A curved vine’s tip.
Goji berries self-boiled,
Atractylodes brewed by hand.
A clay teapot, a sand-stove hearth,
A gourd ladle, a wooden dipper.

**Second Stanza #3:**
The Celestial Gardens, the Penglai Isles,
Jin Valley’s towering halls—
Yet none compare
To this thatched hut’s quiet grace.
Wildflowers embroider the earth—
No need for artificial charm.
Spring suits it well,
So does summer, so does autumn.
When the wine is ripe, it’s worth toasting.
When guests arrive, they must be kept.
No glory, no shame, no care—
Retreat one step further,
What matter the reasons?
Only when weary, sleep;
When thirsty, drink;
When drunk, sing.

**Third Stanza:**
A low, crooked wall,
A squat, sparse window.
A monk’s boy#4 by a tiny pond.
Layered screens rise high and low,
Beside the green water’s edge.
Yet there are breezes,
There are moons,
There are coolnesses.
Daily life is simple:
A wooden table, a vine bed.
Before my eyes—
Water’s hue, mountain’s light.
Guests come without wine,
Yet words of heart may still flow.
Only then—
Jade-warmed tea steeped,
A steaming cup,
A shallow bowl of broth.

**Fourth Stanza:**
Swept clean of dust,
Spared the creeping moss.
Let red leaves
Pile the threshold before me.
Worthy of a painting—
Truly strange and wondrous.
A few pine trees,
A few bamboo stalks,
A few plum branches.
Nurture the flowers and wood,
Let them bloom in turn.
Tomorrow’s matters—
Let Heaven arrange them.
Who knows when wealth and honor may come?
I but drift, content,
Live as fate allows,
And keep my heart at ease.

**Alchemical Pill (Roll of Gold Elixir) – Yang Zhēnrén**

**First Pill (First Watch):**
Wrap in one layer,
Tame the restless mind’s steed.
Monkey-spirit, cease your capers!
When great awakening comes,
The heart grows cool and clear—
All falls away naturally.
The true face ever unbound.
True purity, ever refined,
Ever more serene.
Fewer words, qi preserved whole—
Follow the seasons’ transformations.

**Second Pill (Second Watch):**
Wrap in two layers,
Union of husband and wife.
With child and maiden,
Yin and yang in harmony.
Restore the cosmos,
Let inversion cycle endlessly—
Raise the high, match the low.
Earth Ox, Wood Horse—
Shake the mountains, stir the seas.
With the Ram’s [chariot]#6,
Carry and convey.
Douse the flames,
Roll all into the mud-pill—
Let spirits tremble in awe.

**Third Pill (Third Watch):**
Wrap in three layers,
Root and stem made firm.

**Fourth Pill (Fourth Watch):**
Luminous and hollow—
The sun reaches its zenith.
Must return and invert,
Clay-wrapped, reverse the chariot’s push—
Soil erupts at once.
Wood and metal separated, black tortoise and hare ascend.
The *Dao*’s blade and measuring rod arrive,
Mercury and lead converge.
Descend to fill the earth—
White snow pours into yellow sprouts,
Behold jade flowers, golden lotuses blooming.

**Fourth Pill (Fourth Watch):**
Wrap in four layers,
The Dao’s drum resounds.
Golden rooster, wooden head sings.
Then revolve and rotate,
Ascend and descend through dual gates—
Awaken early, pass through the Hall of Light.
Tiger and dragon move freely,
Can draw and add,
Circulate water and fire.
Refine black to red,
Roll the golden pill within the furnace,
Advance snow-white cinnabar grains.

**Fifth Pill (Fifth Watch):**
Wrap in five layers,
Dawn approaches.
The work is complete,
All is fulfilled.
Then shed the shell,
Come and go without obstruction—
[The] true form revealed.
Ancient and modern immortal families rejoice,
Extend life, forever youthful.
Descend the purple edict,
Report to the Jade Emperor’s decree,
Ascend the auspicious clouds to Penglai Isle.
Two crowns—
**Master Ma Dan-yang**
Wrap in one layer,
Must be focused and pure.

The mind at ease, sit quietly and watch.

Monkeys caper—
Do not let them topple you.
First, reduce sleep’s encroachment.
A scattered mind reveals the azure sky.
Countless grains of sand fulfill the great thousand—
Effort must be made,
To perfect the practice.
This is not contrived—
It is natural.

**Second Watch:**
Wrap in two layers,
Qi flows in pairs.
Lead dissolves, mercury’s flame sears.
Lead becomes mercury,
Mercury becomes lead.
The harmonizing qi fills the Celestial Cavern.
Harmonizing qi, entrusted to the Void’s source.
Nine curves of luminous pearls strung—
Pierce the twin gates,
Shoot through to the azure heights—
Natural, as it ever was.

**Third Watch:**
Wrap in three layers,
Moon at full orb.
Night’s music fades.
Golden Boy rejoices,
Jade Maiden delights.
Ordinary folk are not the same.
The Elixir of Longevity—
Drink it and never reel.
After drinking, return to youth.
On the Curved River’s banks,
Gazing at the hanging clouds.
No need for coin to buy.

**Fourth Watch:**
Wrap in four layers,
Pierce the crystalline depths.
Crystalline depths pierce the azure heights.
Ascend the Other Shore,
Stride over the Phoenix and the Mandarin Duck.
Three years of toil—
Not great words,
But no idle speech.
When spoken, no words remain.

「Monkeys are horses, horses are monkeys—
Do not dismiss them as mere opposites.
**Fifth Watch:**
Wrap in five layers,
Horned melodies blare.
Awakened from pure dreams of Daoist wandering,
Sleep is but a dream, dreams but sleep.
Only now do I know the heart is the Celestial Cavern.
The Dao gives birth to Earth, Earth to the Dao.
*Qi* unites—one breath blends the Primordial Origin.
Add a year, subtract an age,
The True Void remains undisturbed.
Each step is delicate.

**Fan Zhenren** dwells in ancient tombs and cellars.
Moving, sitting, standing—all in song and dance.
Seizing this True Void,
Awakening fiercely.
From ancient times to now, they speak of Dragon and Tiger.
None, not one, truly understands—
Humans awaken.

**The Second:**
Passed down a single phrase of truth,
Teach me to graft and connect.
Since grafting and connecting began,
All separation ends.
Jade buds bloom, golden flowers bear fruit—
Mutes taste molasses honey, speechless.
**The Third:**
Softness and weakness are the family’s virtue.
The Great Dao does not abandon the Void.
Truly, truly there is—
Lead and Mercury.
Water and Fire harmonized, rising and descending in balance.
Civil and Martial forces clash—
Their powers unified.

**The Fourth:**
True practice with true power—
The sword and the elixir swift as wind.
Without meeting a true master-craftsman,
It cannot be made clear.
If you perform this as the first practice,
Every joint in your body,
All flows freely.

**The Fifth**...

**The Sixth:**
The poor child drinks fine wine,
Drinks until he’s drunk and still.
All worldly cares drop from his mind—
Ren’s slanders, blame, all slip away.
A deaf-mute fool—
This is true cultivation.

**The Seventh:**
The Dao of non-action, natural and free,
Pure, nurturing the immortal herb.
Silent understanding—
That is enough.
Darkness veils the furnace sealed.
In an instant of effort—
It is done.

**The Eighth:**
Do not cling to nature as truth.
How then does the yang spirit emerge?
Nine out of ten guard the stubborn void.
If you carry the foundation of life with nature,
White flour baked into bread—
It is certain.

**The Ninth:**
The sacred mushroom grows everywhere,
Yet none recognize it.
When the work is vast and done,
It cannot be matched.
I wish to tell you now—
But fear you’ll disbelieve,
Speak nonsense.

**The Tenth:**
Believe, and you will trust yourself.
Disbelieve, and do not act.
Do not wait until thirst strikes
To dig the well.
Each day you see your labor,
Yet it avails not—
Do not speak of it.

**Appendix:**
I love quiet dwelling,
My heart-mirror ever clear.
When the realm vanishes, emotions forgotten,
Naturally, no distinctions remain.
The lotus scatters across the empty sky,
Revealing the moon in the pure heavens.
This family virtue—
Words cannot fully express it.

**The Second [Appendix]:**
Wrap yourself at the first watch,
Calm the heart, sit upright and steady.

**The Third:**
Drive back the host of demons,
White sheep march in ranks.
Light the lamp within the heart,
Behold the original self.
The mind’s core is pure and bright—
A single pearl hangs suspended.

**The Second [Appendix]:**
At the second watch,
Wrap yourself in silence,
Calm the heart, sit upright and steady.

**The Fourth:**
At the third watch,
The sun arises, parent and child bow toward the golden gate.
The spirit turtle of the sea
Drains the blood of the golden rooster.
*Qi* flows soft and boundless,
Piercing the three passports.
Ten thousand *Dao*’s radiant hues
Lift the moon from the Western River.

**The Fifth:**
At the fourth watch,
All is tranquil on every side.
Within, the heart’s blossom opens,
Enjoying the eternal spring’s scene.
The fifth and sixth gates part—
A true person enters.
A single grain of golden elixir
Is carried to the Kunlun peak.

**The Sixth:**
At the fifth watch,
Dawn returns, fulfilling the vow of practice.
Dragon and tiger entwine,
Rolling up the Yellow River.
Halfway through the sky—
Thunderous voices,
Ghosts and gods cannot fathom the debate.
Recognizing the original self,
The true face is naturally revealed.

**The Seventh:**
After fasting, wandering at leisure,
Singing alone with no one to respond.
Mountain woodcutters
Also sing their *□□□□*[1].
Climbing one slope,
Descending another.
Even as a high official,
None compare to me.

**The Eighth:**
After a year,
Another year is added.
Each day follows fate,
Why strive for idle *heqi*[2]?
Alas, the prime of life
Flees like snapping fingers.
Do not wait until the end—
The thirty-first day of the twelfth month.

**The Ninth:**
I earnestly advise all,
Each to listen and understand.

---
[1] *□□□□* (unclear, possibly a rhyming placeholder)
[2] *heqi* (和氣, harmonious *qi*)

**The Tenth:**
Unversed in *yin-yang*[3],
How could one know the Dao’s path?
At first, one begins—
Refining lead and mercury into form.
Naturally, tortoise and serpent
Guide one along the Caoqi path[4].

**The Eleventh:**
The wise and discerning,
Each must listen and understand.

In the year of *jiǎzǐ*[5], one’s true lifespan—
Day by day, the *zhēnshù*[6] descends.
Breaking free from the mundane cage,
A path to eternal life unfolds.
Avoid the *Yánwáng*’s[7] grasp,
Lest his ghostly messengers drag you away.

At the first watch,
Sitting still, slowly harmonizing *lónghǔ*[8].
Circulating the Three Passes[9],
Piercing into the *níwán*[10].
The Dragon coils in the Golden Cauldron,
The Tiger prowls at the Yellow Court’s gate.
Such efforts—
Do not treat them lightly.

**The Twelfth:**
At the second watch,
The two *yīnyáng* essences merge in subtle *qi*.
Ascending and descending the Three Passes,
Do not let them falter.
The *xiānǚ*[11] and infant,
Both now playfully coquettish.
*Jīngōng* and *Huángpó*[12],
Naturally paired in harmony.

**The Thirteenth:**
At the third watch,
The bright moon illuminates the cosmos.
Daemons flee—
Not a trace within a thousand *lǐ*.
Retreating all *yīnbīng*[13],
No need for elixirs or blades.
The tortoise and serpent of the depths
Naturally entwine.

**The Fourteenth:**
At the fourth watch,
With leisure, study the true scriptures.
Each word profound,
Speaking of Daoist cultivation.
No need for water or fire,
No need for fuel or charcoal.
Refining the elixir—
No gold could match its worth.

**The Fifteenth:**
At the fifth watch,
As dawn breaks, the Golden Rooster crows.
A task at hand—
Clapping hands, laughing aloud.
Feeding the ox fully,
Sleeping joyfully.
When practice is complete,
The *dānshū* decree[14] arrives naturally.

*Yòubóméi*[15] exhorts all to awaken.
Cultivation’s bitterness—
Three layers of suffering.
Yet clearly, one escapes the gate.
*Tán Mǎqiū Liú*[16], *Sūn Wáng Hǎo Tàigǔ*[17],
The *Fǎhǎi*’s[18] boundless compassion—
Universal salvation across the world.

**The Sixteenth:**
Transforming the ignorant and crude.

**The Seventeenth:**
Cast aside the fire-lit halls of sons and daughters.
With the blade of wisdom, sever the three layers of suffering.
Human and self dissolve like mountains collapsing,
Controversies and disputes vanish like dried seas.
Past karmic debts erased,
New calamities not incurred.

**The Eighteenth:**
*Yìng Xiān Jǔ*[19]—respond to the celestial call.
The path of *Xīyí*[20] where mercury and lead blend black and white.
True practice lies below—
The labor of resolute perseverance.
Day and night without sleep,
Coarse robes and plain fare suffice.
Begging alms at street corners,
All beings are my parents.

**The Nineteenth:**
Free from worry.
A lone cloud and wild crane, unbound by constraints.
Within the grass hut,
Leisurely peruse the *Golden Scriptures*.
Outside the window, groves and springs—
Mountains, waters, and bamboo in view.
Bright moon and pure wind,
Worthy companions indeed.

**The Twentieth:**
Nurture the primal essence.
Tame the heart-monkey and mind-horse firmly.
The Six Bandits[21] subdued—
Never coveting their temptations.
Vague and dim, the depths of stillness,
Dull and silent, the realm of emptiness.
Deep and clear, the stillness of nature,
Where essence halts and life abides.

**The Twenty-First:**
Seize the true intent.
Wood and metal, separated yet connected by the *Daoist Path*.
The four limbs as the *Four Symbols*[22],
The five elements as the *Five Phases*[23] gathered whole.
*Qi*[24] coalesces, spirit condenses,
Yin and yang return in natural cycle.
Perfume the body through and through,
The *Microcosmic Fire*[25] burns fully throughout.

**The Twenty-Second:**
Break the path of delusion.

**The Twenty-Third:**
Earth Thunder shakes the mountain peaks with rain.
Yellow sprouts rise, white snowflakes dance.
Dew sprinkles the elixir broth,
Auspicious herbs fill the garden plot.
Jade medicines scatter, golden blossoms unfurl.

**The Twenty-Fourth:**
The realm is worthy of depiction.
Soaring through clouds and waters, steps unbounded.
Over the winding river—
Flying crows, racing hares.
Tigers coil, dragons curl,
Yin and yang converge in high union.
Turning the celestial pass,
Moving the earthly axis.

**The Twenty-Fifth:**
The *Dharma Wheel* resounds.
The *River Chariot* steady with thirty spokes.
Lifting sun and moon,
Rolling them into the golden furnace.
In the jade cauldron, the *Nine Solar Fires* boil.
Ten thousand rays of radiance,
A thousand layers of emerald mist.

**The Twenty-Sixth:**
Enveloping the luminous pearl.
Nurturing the born-again embryo’s dance.
The *True Celebration*—
Fairy maidens gather in circle.
Quenching thirst with *elixir wine*,
The jade zither plays itself.
The melody sets—divine sounds,
Striking metal, striking stone.

**The Twenty-Seventh:**
Being within non-being,
Non-being yet something formed.
Within being and non-being, search and take.
Non-being hides the True,
Being yet seems as non-being.
Forgotten both being and non-being,
Returning to the Great Void.

**The Twenty-Eighth:**
Practices complete.
The Three Isles of Penglai—clusters of immortals gather.
At the *Jade Pool*—
Sages and worthies without number.
All are cultivators of the True,
Daoist companions in the *Path of Perfection*.
Serving the Highest Authentic Ones,
The Western Sovereign, the Holy Mother.

**The Twenty-Ninth:**
Feasting at the Celestial Kitchen,
Immortal robes cling—light as lifting.
Riding *qilin* and phoenix,
Reveling in the Pure Capital.
Jewel halls and *elixir* towers,
Golden nails fill the vermilion gates.
Eternal spring without night,
No coming, no going.

---
**[Song in the Shang Mode – *Wu Ye Er* Tune #6]**
Observing egrets, watching crows,
Fishing for shrimp beneath the waves.
Nightingales weave through willows,
Butterflies dote on flowers.
Scenes of quiet elegance—
None but Cloud Gate’s disciples can praise.

---
**The Thirty-First:**
Reflecting on Lin Ji,
Great compassion as the foundation.
Strike once—
Skin peeled away.
Foolishly dazed,
Unaware of pain or itch.

**The Thirty-Second:**
Brushes of tortoise hair,
Awls of rabbit horn,
Toads leaping to the sky.
Mud ox bellows,
Wooden horses neigh.
Few know—
Bowing and nodding betray celestial secrets.

**The Thirty-Third:**
Wheat has flour,
Millet has grain,
Cloth wraps legs beneath.
Mountains have stone,
Seas have water.
Speak truly—
The *Dao* of the *Cave of the Immortals* stands firm.

**The Thirty-Fourth:**
Taming the mind-horse,
Locking the heart-monkey,
Nurturing *qi* and spirit to fullness.
No forced contortion—
Harmony with nature.
Body in the mysterious,
Law-eyes surpassing the *Great Thousand*.

**The Thirty-Fifth:**
The *Mystic Barrier* sealed,
The *Transformation City*’s gate—
One kick overturns it.
Where flowers bloom red,
Willows turn green.
No obstruction remains—
Everywhere, faces of immortals and Buddhas.

**The Thirty-Sixth:**
Moon at the sky’s edge,
Full and round—
Digging earth to find heaven.
Being and non-being inverted,
Inverted again.
Mysteries profound—
The True *Dao* must be transmitted orally.

**The Thirty-Seventh:**
Moon at the sky’s edge,
Crescent ascending—
The *True Path*’s wonders endless.
Dragons seize tigers,
Tigers seize dragons.
Meeting thus,
They form a golden blossom in the wind.

**The Thirty-Eighth:**
Moon at the sky’s edge,
Directly south—
Three before, three behind.
*Li* is female,
*Kan* is male.
Discussing mysteries—
If not revealed,
How shall one seek?

**The Thirty-Ninth:**

**The Forty-Second:**
Moon at the sky’s edge,
Residing in the furnace—
Lead and mercury in the crucible.
Gold relies on fire,
Refined into a pearl.
One gourd,
Three hundred eighty-four *catty*—
*Mantinghuang* blooms:
Stone and fire’s fleeting light,
Human life too brief—
Death’s arrival cannot be foreseen.
Born or perish—
Like lightning’s fleeting clash.
Piercing the false union of form,
Seeking the *Dao*’s immortal elixir.
Reflecting, then turning toward the Way,
To recognize the sovereign of the *Law*.
Face-to-face, ever-present—
Together walking, sitting,
Drinking the dew of the clouds.
Companions with clear wind and bright moon,
Shared purpose, shared vision of heaven’s light.
Together meeting,
Together seeking the Master’s *Dao*,
Together singing *Mantinghuang*.

---

**The Forty-Third:**
The *Lofty Clouds*’ True Person’s love for mountains
Wears away without end—
Dreaming amid cold forests.
When shall I truly return to the caves,
Sitting on a lotus cushion beneath pine shade?
Wild cranes as companions,
Mountain apes knowing my tune.

**The Forty-Fourth:**
A single pill of marvelous medicine,
A single zither—
All cares sink deep.
Turning, I laugh coldly at worldly travelers,
With whom to barter for gold?

No thought of fading youth,
Yet white hairs creep in unseen.

**The Forty-Fifth:**
North *Yan*’s slopes, grass thick and tangled,
Bones scattered, jumbled.
Tumbled stones, no one recognizes—
Let yellow oxen and white calves till the earth.
What of Qin’s generals and Han’s ministers?

**The Forty-Sixth:**
Better to return, walking with clouds,
Learning eternal life.
The *Dao*-friend by the clear stream,
Picking pine flowers to pair with reishi.
If only the elixir’s sun and moon within,
No need for fame on paper.

**The Forty-Seventh:**
The Southern Expeditionary Protectorate’s horse, *Ru Long*,
Shoulders a carved bow.
With golden seals and purple ribbons late returned,
Called by men a white-haired, failing elder.

A fleeting glance—one brief dream,
Turning away, all things vanish into emptiness.

**The Forty-Eighth:**
Hurrying with a crow’s pickaxe to the cloud-peaked heights,
Leaning alone against a towering pine.
Endless vistas, a thousand poems—
Yet who remains to share my carefree idleness?

Long nights with three cups of murky wine,
Cool evenings with a pillow of clear wind.

**The Forty-Ninth:**
Nine returns, seven transformations—laboring with effort,
Refining in the crimson furnace.
When the Golden Elixir ripens, its light spans a thousand *zhang*,
Rainbow clouds enfold a single dark pearl.
Wrapped in moonlight, I seize the Jade Rabbit,
Within the sun’s heart, I rouse the Golden Crow.

**The Fiftieth:**
The Green Boy delivers the Purple Crane’s scroll,
Inviting me into the *Peng Hu* pavilion.
The Ten Isles bloom with eternal spring,
Drunk on peach wine, fragrance fills the Pure Capital.
A thousand years’ white hair turns black,
A boundless *kalpa*’s pallor remains vermilion.

**The Fifty-First:**
Human wealth and honor—nothing but skulls,
Floating like driftwood on the water.
The dreams of Sui, Tang, Jin, Song, Qi, Liang—
Now only desolate mounds in silence.
Outside the hall, yellow flowers and emerald bamboo,
By the water, white cranes lament the autumn.

**The Fifty-Second:**
Cease, return, and cease—unfurl the brow.
Deep in the white clouds, high repose is fitting,
Like the *Tan Ma Qiu Liu* of Shandong.
Seven golden lotuses bloom resplendent,
Ten thousand branches of jade medicine sway with grace.
A single staff of *lí* wood, let it wander as it will,
Sleeves of coarse cloth trailing long.
Why ask of disputes or worldly gain?
Treading the misty *Yan* slopes, through smoke and vines.
Midday meal beneath twin green pines,
Autumn robes by a pond of blue lotuses.

**The Fifty-Third:**
From the depths of white clouds, songs of purple *zhī* mushrooms,
Laughing coldly, *hēhē*.
On the Long An Road, lingering travelers—
In vain, their dreams enter *Nan Keo*.
Though they boast of fine carriages,
Who knows their temples have turned ashen?

**The Fifty-Fourth:**
North-window poise, jade teeth gleaming,
Midday dreams shattered.
Mountain springs cascade on stone—priceless clarity,
This tower half-sinks into the clouds.
A thousand volumes of poetry, carefree,
A single incense burner, serene and quiet.

**The Fifty-Fifth:**
All ties severed, the heart finds peace,
Returning to youthful vigor.
Within the jar, a single truth revealed—
Who dares now knock at the Mysterious Gate?
Thanks to the thousand-year-old crane,
Silently transmitting the Nine-Turn Elixir.

**The Fifty-Sixth:**
Face like cold iron, bones like withered wood,
Heart like frozen ash.
Dao-emotion does not align with human feeling—
Who then can send or welcome?

Night, listening to the dripping of springs,
Dawn, gazing at the towering mountain hues.

**The Fifty-Seventh:**
A lone, long whistle stirs the cold clouds,
An old crane lingers.
Do not speak of fame in the imperial capital,
Lest it disturb the high recluse on *Tian Tai*.
Prepare a flat-bottomed boat with short oars,
Arrange a bamboo hat and straw sandals.

**The Fifty-Eighth:**
Planting sparse bamboo and towering pines,
To accompany my carefree idleness.
Dense shade covers the cold moss below,
Sitting, I stroke a three-*chi* zither.
Within the cave, crisp and refreshing air,
Between the trees, a rustling clear wind.

**The Fifty-Ninth:**
Long An’s crowned heroes, aged and weary,
Exhausted on the road.
A mere thousand *li* of dusty worldly toil—
White hair like silk, what success remains?
Better the Daoist’s life:
Refining the Nine-Turn Elixir red.

**The Sixtieth:**
Autumn high, I cut *huang jing* with my own hand,
Gradually sensing vitality restored.
A decade’s old ailments worn away—
Yet when meeting others, never speak of longevity.
Thanks to the cow-riding Daoist,
Who last night gifted me *zhī* mushrooms.

---
**The Golden Character Scripture**
*Learning Dao must learn to become a Celestial Daoist.*
Refining the Golden Elixir preserves life entirely.
*Entire*—before *Xi Huang* drew the first trigrams.
*Prenatal qi*, the master’s secret transmission.

**The Second:**
The Great Elixir’s medicine is not hard to seek.

**The Third:**
Every home has its seed—self-cultivation is possible.
Cultivation: rest and depart from the elixir furnace.
From the void arises, the *Kàn* trigram inverted, high and received.
**The Fourth:**
The Golden Elixir’s wondrous Dao is a great divine power.
Descend and gather the White Tiger, subdue the Red Dragon.
The Dragon: simmered and refined in a jade tripod.
In a moment’s use, the *yin-yang* transformative work is done.
**The Fifth:**
The enlightened light penetrates the original school.
Boundless *dharma* realms, one essence unified.
Unified: with Zen mind.
Empty yet not empty.
Thus, the *Tathāgatas* and Laozi share the same *rúhuà* essence.

**The Sixth:**
Cultivate the True Nature, restore the original complete truth.
Free and unbounded, one beyond all things.
Beyond: no greed, no suffering, no anger.
Longevity’s matter—spring blooms on the apricot branch.

**The Seventh:**
Good deeds: eight hundred virtues, three thousand practices.
Roam the Four Seas, guide those with affinity.
Affinity: the Nine-Palace Elixir Decree proclaims.
Riding the *luán* crane and *hè* heron,
Join the ranks before the Celestial Court.

**The Eighth:**
Perception, hearing, and awareness all cease.
Awakening to true emptiness—pass the exam and return.
Return: pierce the *zào huà* mechanism.
Not difficult, yet beyond—eternal *kalpa*, heaven and earth aligned.

**The Ninth:**
Heaven’s secrets leaked—exhort the learned.
Not ordinary *qiánhuì*—Dao wisdom does not pass through.
Through: sweep away and uphold the orthodox school.
Diligently cultivate, and the *rúhuà* essence flows—
Daoist saints and immortals arise.

---
**The [Middle Lǚ] "Welcome the Daoist Guest"**
The *Hùnyuán* Pearl—priceless treasure.
Collected at the Red Water Stream’s edge.
Its hue is blurred, its light clear and bright.
Held firmly in hand, it judges all worldly affairs.

**The Second:**
No schemes, no contrivance.

**The [Middle Lǚ] "Welcome the Daoist Guest" (Continued)**

**The Third:**
Sun and moon vie in urging—never aging.
A boat sails backward, oars turned upside down.
Who knows this one—*qīngjìng jiāfēng* so pure and good.
**The Third:**
Water deep and clear, mountains in fine hue.
All worldly strife and bias—none reach here.
Bamboo windows dim, thatched roof small.
True joy within—do not speak of it to mortals.

**The Fourth:**
Bamboo wind soft, flowers cast heavy shadows.
One cup of wine, three pluckings of the *qín*.
Reveal the *xuàn* of heaven’s workings,
Hide its wondrous uses.
At the *huáitán* of willow and locust,
Ministers and generals see through life’s fleeting dream.

**The Fifth:**
By gnarled willow’s shade, beneath pine’s shadow.
Stand upright—all ties dissolved.
Lock the heart-monkey, seize the mind-horse.
With whom share tales of longevity beneath moon and wind?

**The Sixth:**
Han Zhongli left office, rank and title abandoned.
Awakening from *Nánkē*’s dream, he cast aside the golden seal.
Straw sandals light, millet staff steady.
Laughing with sun and moon, he strides alone in the realm of longevity.

**The Seventh:**
Lü Dongbin transcends the mundane.
Divine light pierces the *sāniàn jiè* of existence.
Discarding fame and fortune—like common weeds.
With a staff of tortoise-shell hair, one strike shatters heaven and earth.

**The Eighth:**
From *Hùnyuán*’s dawn, Zhang Guolao appears.
A white donkey treads the void, inverted in flight.
Purple clouds rise, red mists swirl.
In one night’s gulp, he devours the Penglai Isles.

**The Ninth:**
Lan Caihe departs from worldly ways.
His hand strikes a clapper against cold *jù*.
He shakes the celestial gates, rocks the earthly axis.
With moon and wind, he sings his own hymn of longevity.

**The Tenth:**
Liu Haichan, the Yan Chancellor.
In dreams, he sees through empty red censers—
A single snowflake struck, then released.
Far from mortal paths, he departs the sea’s heights.
A golden statue—his likeness.

**The Eleventh:**
Guangchengzi, a thousand and two hundred.
High on Kongtong, he sleeps in cold white clouds.
The Sage of Emperors, the Dwelling of Heaven and Earth.
Roaming freely, beyond names—
A guest outside all things.

**The Twelfth:**
Fan Li, who once aided Yue.
Alone, he drifts on the Five Lakes in a moonlit skiff.
Forgotten are right and wrong,
Severed are fame and gain.
A lone short flute—
Enjoying the snow on reeds.

**The Thirteenth:**
Zhang Zifang, who upheld the Great Han.

**The Eighteenth:**
Let them wear crimson and jade robes—
My heart is free of care, my body at ease.
Few in the world are so cunning and sly as this one.

**The Nineteenth:**
Worldly affairs are done, how serene and secluded.
The recluse beneath the trees, unbound and unrestrained.
Before the emerald cliffs, friends of wind and moon.
Drunken songs and wild dances—
Gulping down the elixir of eternal life.

**The Twentieth:**
Drunk, I sleep; awake, I rub my head.
Fallen east or west, I know no shame.
No spring, no autumn—
Only boundless vitality, enjoying prolonged years.

**The Twenty-First:**
Returning with herbs, white clouds drift.
Mist locks the green mountains, the immortal path lost.
Black apes cry, green crows tread.
A crane dances ahead, leading me back to the cave.

**The Twenty-Second:**
Inside the cave, the bamboo door is shut.
A youthful immortal awaits, poised for a game of chess.
When bored, I drink from a jade cup.
My straw sandals trip me—
I sleep without removing my clothes.

**The Twenty-Third:**
The cliffs are steep and strange.
Cypress, pine, and green pines encircle me.
Silent, no one passes by.
Loneliness and ease, cold detachment in leisure.

**The Twenty-Fourth:**
My face is sour from stale rice,
A cracked wooden bowl, a broken bamboo strainer.
No divine grace, only pickled greens.
Content with my portion, better than rare delicacies.

**The Twenty-Fifth:**
I wear grass sandals, a hemp rope tied.
A patched raincoat, a gourd hung by my side.
Half fisherman, half woodcutter.
My hair wild, my face grimed—
Let others laugh.

**The Twenty-Sixth:**
They mock me as an exile—I know it well.
My true companions are moon and wind.
Outside, white clouds—
Blowing a jade flute.
Such tastes the world cannot fathom.

*Once, in Water-Bamboo Village,*
*I raged like the wind at Sweet River’s ford.*
*Seven golden lotuses, fresh and bright.*
*Among the hills, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun.*

**The Second [Poem]:**
*(Note: This appears to be a separate, standalone poem appended to the series.)*

**The Twenty-Seventh:**
I once was born in Ma Half-State.
With my Master, I spoke of fate’s design.
Alone in garden walls, I turned inward to refine.
When virtue and practice reached their peak, I journeyed to Penglai Isle.
*His Third [Poem]:*

**The Twenty-Eighth:**
My true name, in the Four Great’s guise, is Tan.
In past lives, I met my Master and cast off worldly ties.
Roaming clouds, I never stayed in any temple’s shade.
When virtue and practice reached their peak, I ascended to the Celestial Stage.
*His Fourth [Poem]:*

**The Twenty-Ninth:**
My birthplace was Laizhou’s Wuguan.
I met my Master, surnamed Changsheng.
Through alleys and willow lanes, I wandered without hindrance.
Unsoiled by dust, my nature shone as bright as moon.
*His Fifth [Poem]:*

**The Thirtieth:**
By imperial decree, I was granted purple robes in Tianchang.
Now I am Cloudlight Ironfoot Wang.
When I met my Master, I journeyed to Luoyang.
Virtue and practice complete, I reached my Master’s Celestial Homeland.
*His Sixth [Poem]:*

**The Thirty-First:**
At nineteen, I cast off home and worldly fate,
And at Banxi’s ford, I set my resolve and found peace.
I realized the Eternal Spring’s endless day.
The Great Dao’s gate stands open, its teachings passed through ages.
*His Seventh [Poem]:*

**The Thirty-Second:**
From ancient times to now, I speak of fate’s design.
Beneath Zhaozhou’s bridge, I spent my years.
Singing by the bridge, the water does not flow.
When one leaf falls, the autumn comes to all below.
*His Eighth [Poem]:*

---

**The First [Poem] of the *Fangtong Tree* [Series]:**
At the first watch, I wrap myself in meditation.
The wandering mind and restless thoughts are bound and struck.
Do not let idle play distract.
In silent stillness, I refine the Embryonic Breath.
The gates of Heaven and Earth, once sealed, now open wide.
Thus, the truth of Dao’s mysteries is truly revealed.

**The Second [Poem]:**
At the second watch, I share the universe’s essence.
A spark of spirit gradually pierces through.
The Tiger and Dragon first unite, their rigor complete.
The Three Vermin must not flee.
The Wisdom Blade in the void avenges wrongs.

**The Third [Poem]:**
I sever the heads of all demons.
**The Fourth [Poem]:**
At the third watch, I stir the Dynamic Yang.
In gold cauldron I refine, in jade furnace I cook.
True lead and mercury are forged.
The artisan’s hand carves open the jade lotus pod.
Two rays of crimson light illuminate the Kunlun peak.
Ten thousand pearls descend as treasures.

**The Fifth [Poem]:**
At the fourth watch, the clouds disperse completely.
The tortoise and star of the sea’s depths play with the bright moon.
Everywhere, jade flowers bloom.
The fire’s intensity is adjusted with precision, following the seasons’ rhythms.
At the child and wu hours, the qi rises, descending crimson dross.
I boldly reveal the secrets of Heaven.

**The Sixth [Poem]:**
At the fifth watch, in drowsy stillness, I am settled.
My mind nurtures the vast moon—a single mirror of clarity.
It pierces through greed and wrath’s afflictions.
This time, even ghosts and gods must tremble.
Only true purity is true stillness.
When virtue is complete, I ascend to the Celestial Sage.
Step by step, I rise.

**The Seventh [Poem]:**
At the first watch, I sit with a clear heart, sleeves unfurled.
The Monkey and Horse are firmly bound and locked.
The Wisdom Blade is sharpened.
The Six Bandits and Three Vermin all flee in panic.
The host of demons is driven back.
Even in sleep, I rest in my clothes.
Upon waking, the drowsy wind clears and sends me forth.
I awaken to the Peach Blossom Spring’s cave.
At the gate of the Underworld’s realm,
I leisurely visit Master San Mao—my joy knows no end.
The wind through the window stirs.
I awaken from my Wandering Immortal’s dream.

**The Second [Poem]:**
At the second watch, I sleep by the White Ox Brook.
The herdsman drunkenly stumbles, lost in wine.
His rain hat and cloak lie piled.
Beneath the moon, the flute’s tune is just begun—
Joyfully, I return.
Returning to the Land of Hua Xiu,
I embrace its boundless ease.
With leisure, I pluck the jade zither’s strings—
Its notes soar high.
From the fire emerges the tortoise bearing white cranes.
I play the cloud-flute.
Purple mist and crimson light shine bright.

**The Third [Poem]:**
At the third watch, the Milky Way’s stars fade thin.
I step outside, my body searching.
The moon hangs due south.
The Two Eights’ maiden pairs with the youthful boy—
Refining the Three Threes.
I seize the Celestial Pass and shake it.
In the Five Bright Hall, the Primordial Star gathers.
Ascending the Seven Treasure Mountain, I depart.
I pray to the Jade Void.
The Primordial Beginning hangs the millet-pearls aloft.
I inscribe the Golden Script.
The land prospers, the people thrive in wealth.

**The Fourth [Poem]:**
At the fourth watch, the Mysterious Enclosure’s breeze is fine.
Coming and going, no obstruction remains.
I loosen my filthy robes.
The Heart-Moon hangs high, illuminating the Cloudy Brook.
I climb the Heavenly Ladder.
Alone, I pluck the moon’s jade from the Rabbit’s Palace.
In the Three Realms and Ten Directions, I walk unmatched.
I recognize the path to Caoqi.
Nothing remains.
True joy, true delight—drinking the cream of bliss.
No need to buy.
I sing the soundless melody.

**The Fifth [Poem]:**
At the fifth watch, the Golden Rooster crows upon its frame.
The wayfarers below are sprightly in their gait,
As dawn approaches.
I lift the basketless staff to stir the bottomless depths.
A gusting wind I cross—
Together we journey to the Penglai Isle.
Who else knows this family’s wind?
No need to fear decay or old age.
I strike the *Lángbǎn* drum—
In the deep jade waves, I fish for whales and turtles.
Emerging from the billows,
I gather the elixir of longevity.
*"Nánxiāng Zǐ"*:
True mercury with true lead,
Born in the Primordial and Post-Heaven realms.
When the time is known, pluck and gather with diligence—
The Mysterious Mystery.
If the acupoint is lost, why fret?
To become a transcendent, no need.
The fire must be refined and unwavering,
Examining the *qiàn* before and after.
From *Lián* (屯) I draw, and in *Méng* (蒙) I cease—
Hard to teach.
A single hair’s misstep will not yield the elixir.

**The Second [Poem]:**
With both hands, I split the *Hóngméng* [cosmic egg].
The wisdom-sword flies forth to the first peak.
Outer Daoists and *xiūluó* [demonic beings] are startled, their necks drawn tight—
Divine powers.
The transformation was always within my grasp.
I forge the *yù* [jade] and *hú* [fire] in the alchemical furnace—red.
The *qí* [key] and *suǒ* [lock] are blown by the *xùn* [conforming] wind.
In the tenth month, I shed my form and swallow it within—
*Kūn* [Earth] Palace:
Instantly, the Three Pure Ones and the Grandest Ancestor appear.

**The Third [Poem]:**
I nurture the *xiàng* [form] through the *Zhōutiān* [Cosmic Cycle].
The fire must be gentle yet complete.
To cherish the infant, only the mother’s care suffices—
Three years.
I apply and refine the *xiàng* [form], drawing and adding as it wanes and returns.
At the confluence of the *Niúdǒu* [Big Dipper] and the River,
I abandon and take the Mysterious Pearl to sow the Jade Field.
My resolve is steady as I govern the fire’s stages—
Refined and unwavering.
I split the abdomen clearly and explain it to the worthy.

**The Fourth [Poem]:**
Life’s *jiǎ* [first stage] gives way to its *gēng* [second stage].
This is the elixir’s kernel—clearly mark it.
Gather the tender herbs and return them to the earthen pot—
To simmer and refine.
Yield and hardness, strength and softness, proceed in order.
A single dose will yield the elixir.
Bathing and guarding against peril, I hold fast to the city.
Here, no need to govern the fire’s stages—
Hold the fullness.
If fire is added, it will surely topple.

**The Fifth [Poem]:**
Carve and wrap the effort—uniformly applied.
With earnest study, probe the elixir’s every detail,
Not a hair’s breadth overlooked.
Ten months of diligent self-preservation.

**The Sixth [Poem]:**
The Cauldron’s method mirrors Heaven and Earth—
Above, the Celestial Primordium; below, the Terrestrial.
If one can reverse and invert their operation,
Alternating and exchanging,
Opening and closing cycle through the Eight Gates,
Lifting to Kunlun’s heights.
The Tortoise and Serpent brothers spit and swallow.
At the hundred-foot pole’s peak, grip the line tight—
Lift and surge.
From here, the Original Spirit and life endure forever.

**The Seventh [Poem]:**
The Passages lock within the Microcosmic Orbit.
Ascending and descending cycle through the Three-Inch Field.
Not in exhaling, inhaling, or counting breaths—
It is natural.
Nine transformations without loss, fire’s power complete.
Fetal breathing is but idle talk.
The key lies in balancing yin and yang—
No deviation.
All breathing, blowing, and exhaling rely on the Gentle Wind,
Soft and enduring.
The marvel lies in the fore-strand and the after-strand.

**The Eighth [Poem]:**
The *Kàn* [Returning] hexagram rises with the Hidden Dragon.
Stealthily adjust *wu-jǐ* [the fifth and sixth stems]—
Do not yet assault.
At the second line, the Dragon appears, mastering the hexagram,
Divine efficacy.
From here, the furnace’s stages turn crimson in order.
The *Tài* [Peace] hexagram meets again.
Fierce fire burns *qián* [the creative], aided by the Gentle Wind.
Refined, the Yellow Sprout and White Snow emerge—
Extraordinary achievement.
Returning, it follows the *Kūn* [Earth] path to completion.

**The Ninth [Poem]:**
Recognize the Metal within Water.
Smelting and refining deepen its essence.
Advance and retreat, drawing the sacrificial—
Nine transformations, floating and sinking.
Nurture the Hidden Dragon, then let it ascend.
Marvelous operation from the Heavenly Heart.
Relying on the Yellow Nurse—*bǐng-rén* [the third and ninth stems]—
Ferment the cream, descending from the mountain peak,
Pouring again and again.
Slowly plucking the stringless lute’s single note.

**The Tenth [Poem]:**
The eldest son proceeds to the Western Quarter.
The maiden returns to *Kūn* [Earth], transforming into six *yáng* [male/positive] lines.
Then it is time to apply effort and cultivate the *Èr-Bā* [Two-Eight, i.e., the Eight Trigrams].
Fortify the banks.

From the Nine Quarters, the Dao/Way itself flourishes.
The Bull and Dipper constellations deliberate together.
Artistry surpasses Heaven’s craft—wonder beyond compare.
The High *Kàn* [Abyss] and its spouse consummate their union;
Hard to forget.

Only now does one perceive the *Hú* [Caulron]’s eternal sun and moon.

**The Eleventh [Poem]:**
White Snow and Yellow Sprout—
Two refined essences of the same luminous family.
Plucking and selecting, discerning decline and vigor,
Worthy of praise.

Not a hair’s breadth may the fire’s intensity vary.
At the summit, the Three Flowers bloom.
The Ram Chariot and Deer Chariot move in harmony.
The Hare and Tortoise pass between the South and North,
Their interplay ceaseless.

From here, the Heavenly River stirs with steady oars.

**The Twelfth [Poem]:**
Purity complete, revealing Heaven’s design.
Only fear that contemporaries remain lost in delusion.
The pearl beneath the chin must be seized with vigor—
Do not delay.

The Dao/Way lies within the body—
Who else could question it?
Cast off the dust-net swiftly.
A hundred years of life, yet seven [critical] moments are rare.
Do not wait until old age when lead and mercury dwindle—
Worthy of lament.

Karmic retribution’s path is hard to deceive oneself.
An inch of gold—
Worthy of sighing over the multitude of deluded ones,
How few awaken to the dream’s empty blossoms.

「Yet adorned with embroidered brocade curtains and copper peaks,
With crimson shoes and jade hairpins—
What use are they to the body in the end?

Better than the dusty world,
Are secluded bamboo fences and humble cottages.
Beneath the green pines,
A single verse of lofty song—
Laughing defiantly as the years transform into ages.

**The Realm of the Purple Palace,**
Spring’s light pure,
When the refined gather—
Wondrous existence, true delight.
See the natural celestial music,
Star towers and moon palaces,
Cranes soaring, phoenixes dancing.

In the depths of white clouds,
Within the wine cup—
A landscape of divine immortals.
Who would willingly turn back to youth?

**The Realm of Effortless Wandering,**
Only I return,
Then re-enter the boundless void of **Leiyang**.*

**The Second [Poem]:**
**Appreciating Snow**

The evening wild geese cry mournfully,
And the late earthly hums echo—
Cold winds arise together.
Frost forms with severity,
Dark clouds gather uniformly—
The Four Seas display the auspicious jade dragon.

Snowflakes dot a thousand households with pristine beauty,
Ice blossoms unfold in radiant splendor.
The finest moment is when,
Inviting poetic companions,
We surround the brazier with paper screens, lost in intoxication.

Reciting,
We seek exquisite verses—
Outside the bamboo, a fresh fragrance;
Golden threads spurt new buds.

Like scattered silver grains,
Or powdered butterflies,
Flitting high and low in empty embrace.
It is known that this is a sign of great peace,
A premonition of **Yin-Yang** harmony.

This profound truth,
When shared with a kindred spirit like **Zi You**,
Reveals the genuine flavor of the rivers and skies.

**The Seventh Movement of the *Wuling* Series concludes.**
#1 The following nineteen pieces are all **danci** (散曲小令).
#2 The following nine pieces are all **danci** (散曲小令).
#3 The following twenty-five pieces are all **danci** (散曲小令).

**The Eighth Movement of the *Wuling* Series:**
*Siming at Xianyou Mountain by Daoist Priest Peng Zhizhong*

**Western River Moon #1**
**[Attributed to Zhang Boduan]**」

**#1**
Inner elixirs are like outer elixirs—
Inner must harmonize with outer.
The cinnabar essence blends as kindred does.
Nourishing warmth works in myriad ways.
Within lies natural celestial fire,
Flame-red and blazing in the furnace.
The outer furnace’s fuel must be adjusted with diligence.
No art surpasses the true seed.

**#2**
This Dao is most divine and sacred,
Yet its weight for rulers is light—hard to dispel.
Refining lead and mercury takes more than a morning.
Early glimpse the black pearl’s omen.
If worthy men would cultivate,
Why dwell in markets or courtly halls?
The practice is simple, though the elixir is not distant.
Speak of it, and men will laugh in scorn.

**#3**
The White Tiger’s essence is supreme treasure,
The divine pool’s waters—true gold refined.
Thus, the highest virtue’s source runs deep.
Not like common medicines.
To forge the Nine Transformations,
First refine the self and steady the mind.
Take at the proper time—let not float or sink.
Increase the fire, but guard against peril.

**#4**
Seven returns of cinnabar restore its root,
Nine returns of golden liquid restore its truth.
Do not fixate on the hours of *Yin* and *Yang* or *Kun* and *Shen*.
Observe the Five Phases for measure.
It is but mercury in essence,
Circulating through all celestial phases.
When *Yin* and *Yang* qi are full, it naturally becomes numinous.
Its emergence and retreat never leave the Mysterious Female.

**#5**
To retain true lead and bind mercury,
The inner minister never strays from home.
Wood and metal, though separated, meet without cause—
They need the Yellow Matchmaker’s aid.
Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,
Metal’s passion clings to wood’s benevolence.
Devouring, consuming, yet ever close—
Only then does the man bear fruit.

**#6**
Which household’s maiden of twenty-eight,
Which lord of thirty-nine?
They call themselves Wood Elixir and Metal Essence—
Only when they meet the Earth do they form the Three Families.
Further refined by Master Ding’s tempering,
Then husband and wife at last unite in joy.
The River Chariot dares not pause,
Carried to Kunlun’s peak.

**#7**
The love of Ox and Girl aligns with the Dao,
Tortoise and Serpent share their natural kindred.
The Toad and Crow meet at the New Moon’s brilliance,
Their two *qi* intermingle in motion.
All is the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth—
Who can fathom this profound abyss?
When *Yin* and *Yang* are severed, fault arises.
How could one endure Heaven’s length and Earth’s span?

**#8**
The Male encloses the Female within,
Bearing *Yin* while embracing *Yang* essence.
The two combine—medicine is complete.
Refining soul and spirit to their finest.
Truly, one grain of Golden Elixir—
When the serpent swallows, it becomes a dragon.
Even chicken feed transforms into phoenix and *peng*.
Soaring into the True Realm of Azure Yang.

**#9**
Heaven and Earth have just passed through *Pi* and *Tai*—
Morning and evening, recognize *Lún* and *Méng*.
Radiating wheels converge at the hub, water pays homage to the center.
The marvel lies in adding and subtracting with precision.
Gain one, and all things are accomplished—
No need to distinguish east, west, south, or north.
Diminish again, and guard against undoing past efforts.
Treasure life—do not trifle with it lightly.

**#10**
At Winter Solstice, *Yin* returns to *Yang*’s rebirth,
Three decades add one *Yang* line.
Midmonth, the *Gua* reverses at dawn’s first light.
After the full moon, *Kàn* ends—stains appear.
Days further divide into cold and heat,
*Yang* rises again in midnight’s hour.
At noon, the *Guà* symbol—one *Yin* ascends.
Refining elixir must know dawn and dusk.

**#11**
Virtue cultivated beyond eight hundred,
*Yin* merit accumulated to three thousand.

「The harmonious balance of things unites me with kin and grievance.
At first, the aspiration for immortality and divine beings was kindled.
Tigers and rhinoceroses, blades and armies do not harm,
Yet the fleeting fire of the mortal abode cannot be constrained.

A precious talisman descends—leaving courtly service behind,
Steadily riding the *luan* carriage and *feng* palanquin.

**#12**
Without discerning the Five *Xing* and Four *Xiang*,
One does not distinguish cinnabar (*zhu*), mercury (*gong*), lead, or silver.
The methods of refining the elixir’s fire are unheard of,
Yet early on, one is hailed as a recluse (*juyin*).

Unwilling to reflect on one’s own errors,
One further misleads others with false teachings.
Fearful that others remain lost in the *Mijin* (crossing of delusion) for eternal ages,
One endures deceit with a hardened heart.

**#13**
The elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body (*seshin*),
Refined, its transformations are boundless.
It can further ascend to explore the true *Zong* (essence),
Unraveling the wondrous use of non-birth (*wusheng*).
No need to rely on another’s merit in future ages—
Divine powers are gained in this very life.

Since the Dragon Maiden (*Longnü*) undertook this labor,
Who afterward could follow in her footsteps?

**#14**
*(Attributed to Xiao Tingzhi)*
With two hands, one cleaves apart the *Hun* (chaos),
Revealing the Dao/Way of refining the elixir plainly.
The *rihun* (solar essence) and *yuepo* (lunar spirit) move from west to east,
Seize them firmly—do not let them slip away.
Outer *Dao/Way* and heretical *mo* (demons) shrink in fear,
All vying to bind treasure within the inner palace (*zhonggong*).
The Nine *Huan* and Seven *Fan* (alchemical cycles) are achieved in an instant,
Yet all depend on the Yellow Woman (*Huangpo*)’s guidance.

**#15**
Silently harnessing the *buqian* (mysterious transformations) of *Yin* and *Yang*,
The marvel lies in the precision of adding and subtracting—
Found in the convergence of *Tun* and *Meng* (trigram symbols).」

**#16**
To recognize the true *qian* (lead) and true *gong* (mercury),
All derived from a single root source.
The alchemical *fire* (huǒ) and timing are profound in their mystery—
Only the true adept can discern them.

When gathering, do not err in season or day,
Still distinguish the *hai* (posterior) from the *xian* (anterior).
In the *jinyu* (jade furnace), a moment’s heat sears the heavens,
The *Dao/Way*’s person (*Zhenren*) appears without rank.

**#17**
Do not ask of the *Nine* (9) and *Three* (3), nor the *Two* (2) and *Eight* (8),
For there is no excess in *Yin*’s even or *Yang*’s odd.
Mostly, high *Kan* (water) and low *Gen* (mountain) form the union.
Recognize *Tun* and *Meng*—they are the key.

If you pass the first *Yang* (male) ascent,
Then you may advance the fire without delay.
For the slightest misstep lies in the hairsbreadth,
And reckless *wild alchemy* (*yèzhàn*) demands precision.

**#18**
The *ding* (cauldron) and *qi* (vessel) follow the *Tian* (Heaven) and *Di* (Earth) symbols,
*Kan* (water) and *Li* (fire) in operation show no deviation.
The *husband* and *wife* meet in the *Huang* (Yellow) household,
Speaking of the *wu sheng* (non-born) marvels.

Rain’s intent and clouds’ emotions are fully understood,
At the *Ling* (peak) head, the *jia* (vehicle) is urged forward.
Returning to the summit, the *Nine* and *Three* bloom—
Seal the *jinyuan* (jade gate) with *golden locks* (*jīnsuǒ*).

**#19**
Stirring the *top* (dǐng) and *gate* (mén) closures,
The tiger roars and dragon hums naturally.
The *Nine* return and *Seven* return—profound in meaning,
Entering and exiting never stray from the *mystic female* (*Xuǎnpìn*).

Using the *jinyu* (jade furnace) at the right *fire* (huǒ) moment,
True *gold* (*zhenjīn*) is refined within the cauldron.
When the *qi* (vital force) is strong and the battle won,
The secret lies in no harm, no loss.

**#20**

**#21**
Returning twice to nourish the *fire* (yǎnghuǒ),
The rabbit and rooster bathe in concealment.
The clear transformations manifest at the center,
The *playing pearl* (xuánzhū) is sealed and refined.

**#22**
Pressing between the *spine* (jiājǐ) and dual *gates*,
Piercing to the *top* (dǐng)—this is the **Great Dao’s Mystic Portal** (*Dàdào Xuánmén*).
The *golden elixir* (jīndān) is but this **School’s Root-Power** (*zōnggēn lìdà yào*).
Know the moment to stir and transport it.
Nurturing warmth, defending the *city* (*shòuchéng*), and wild battles,
Frequently ingesting the *flowering pool’s* (huāchí) *jade nectar* (yùyè).
Always use the *jade furnace* (yùlú) with gentle, warming *fire* (huǒ).
Gather herbs, discerning their maturity—whether aged or tender.

**#23**
The *Nine Oils* (jiǔyóu) surge upward against the tide,
In an instant, they rush past the *Heavenly Heart* (*Tiānxīn*).
On Kunlun’s peak, the waters are pure and clear—
Fermenting the *celestial fluid* (qióngjiāng) for self-nourishment.
At this very moment, begin to gather and refine,
The *River Vehicle* (héchē) transports without pause.
The *One Qi* (*yīqì*) of *Yin-Yang* is naturally captured and sunk.
Seal the *jade gate* (yùguān) with steadfast locks.

**#24**
The *medicine* (yào) is born in the southwest *Kun* (earthly branch) land,
The *golden elixir* (jīndān) is its true root-school.
Students must diligently ponder and exhaust its depths—
Its marvel surpasses all, unmatched by true essence.

**#25**
The Great Dao of *Golden Elixir* (jīnyè huándān) is the ancient path,
Transmitted through eons by the sages of old.
With bared heart and split belly, their scrolls are revealed—
Guiding souls beyond the Dao’s shore.
Do not marvel at the heavens’ secrets being laid bare,
For beyond the *Play of Mysteries* (Xuánxuán), there is no deeper mystery.
Left to the ancients and the worthy of name—
Those with ears shall clearly perceive.

**#26**
A full stomach harms the heart and depletes the *qi*,
Excessive sleep entangles one in dreams, obscuring the True.
When the eyes move, the spirit is lost; when the ears listen, the *Lingtai* (spiritual platform) grows dim.
To behold the Original Face, wield the *wisdom-blade* to sever the red dust.
Unfeeling response to things is the natural truth—
This is the swiftest path of cultivation.

**#27**
Sudden enlightenment reveals the Dao’s principles:
Banish desire, conquer sleep, and subdue the demonic foes.
Avoiding fame and gain, one faces fewer storms.
Laziness and drift pass as one follows fate.
Hunger drives one to beg for scraps in the streets,
While satiety invites aimless wandering.
In leisure, one sings at ancient temples—
Who else roams so freely as I?

**#28**
Wealth and honor cannot enter me, nor does poverty trouble me.
With fate and destiny, disputes arise—
Yet without fortune or misfortune, there is no calamity.
Let them indulge in extravagance, for even a gourd and bowl sustain life.
I counsel you not to labor in vain—
When the Great Limit arrives, how can one flee?

**#29**
First, do not slight the teacher nor disregard the method.
Second, recite the pure *Immortal Scriptures* (xiānjīng).
Third, preserve the True *qi* to nourish the spirit.
Fourth, sweep away all dust and toil.
Fifth, sever the darkness of ignorance’s fire,
Sixth, cast off the shackles of worldly emotions.
Seventh, tame the *monkey* and *horse*—eternal peace follows.
Eighth, drink the *Eight Immortals’ Elixir* (bāxiān zhēng).

*Yǒngyùlè* (Joy of Eternity):
All cultivate, all swallow—who grasps the True Dao?
Crooked paths and minor methods mislead many.
Róngchéng was no immortal—his herb-gathering was in vain.
One day, stripped from the vat’s depths, his nature crumbles.
Better to turn inward, embrace *wuwei* (non-action), and study the original *Zhuāngzi-Laozi*.
Align *Yin-Yang*, refine *lead* and *mercury*—the *Eight Trigrams* mark the foundation.
Life is a dream, years like arrows—turn back while you may.
Clinging to spring flowers and autumn moons—when will it end?

**Part Two**
All *dharma* arises from the heart; observe the *Dharmadhātu* (Law-realm)—all is mind-made.
Buddha and Dao converge; measure not, yet never depart—
The heart itself is the Way.
Since knowing *Kàn* and *Lí* (water and fire),
Mixing and refining elixirs, one dimly grasps dawn and dusk.
See the rooster fly to the *Tianhuang* (Heavenly Palace),
The hare race across the *Danque* (Elixir Gate)—no more affliction.
Within the *qi*, the True Fluid; within the Fluid, the True *qi*—
Harmonized, neither too much nor too little.
Sowing the yellow sprout, refining into red water,
The *Dragon* and *Tiger* entwine in their embrace.
Nine returns, seven refineries—when the work is complete,
I reclaim my youth of old.
Await the three thousand cycles,
When merit is fulfilled and the path is round—
Then it is done.

**Part Three**
Cultivate the Dao, preserve the heart, refine the spirit—
Lightness must be the aim.
Restore the marrow, return the essence—
Flowing water does not rot, the door-hinge never decays.
The *sun-soul* and *moon-shadow* reunite in the furnace—
True *qi* gathers naturally.
Tame the heart-monkey, recall the mind-horse—
No trace of dust remains.
Within stillness, clarity emerges—
When *Yang Dragon* and *Yin Tiger* merge, water and fire blend—this is the measure.
The *Eight Segments of Marvelous Text*, the *Thousand-Mouthed Living Method*—
Above, there is a path.
Lǚ Gōng’s lofty virtue does not abandon the world—
If one has the portion, they must meet.

Across the *Ten Isles* and *Three Mountains*,
Mounting *Luan* and *Hè*, we depart together.

**Part Four**

**Part One**
Nurture water, nurture essence, nurture spirit, nurture blood—
First, one must nurture *qi*.
Sun and moon, yin and yang,
The six lines, the eight *guà*—
Study closely the *Cān Tóng Qì* [参同契].

An empty body, an empty treasure—
A thousand words, ten thousand phrases—
All boil down to two characters: *Kǎn* and *Gāo* [坎高].

Ascending Kunlun’s peak,
Returning to the origin, restoring the root—
One must clarify beginning and end.

Though the body be small,
It mirrors heaven and earth—
Eighty-four thousand *lǐ* vast.

The *Xuān Dàn* gate [玄牝],
Giving birth to myriad transformations—
All lies within *Chōng Hé* [冲和].

This is the true truth beyond;
No other ultimate truth exists—
Only then does one believe in the *One Dao*.

When we meet again with Zhōng Lǚ [钟吕],
If there remain unclear points,
I beg the Master’s guidance.

---
**Song: *Yú Jiā Ào* [渔家傲]**
The Ultimate Dao is not distant—it lies near.
A hair’s breadth misstep is like a thousand *lǐ* apart.

The Dao is hard to seek, yet its source is simple.
If we meet in harmony,
A single leap reaches the Buddha’s realm.

When water and fire merge—*Jì Jì* [既济]—
The *Three Corpses* and *Six Bandits* all retreat.
This alone grants eternal life and keen vision.

Body, speech, mind—
Transformed into one point of *Chōng Hé* *qi*.

---
**Part Two**
Spirit is nature, *qi* is life—
Let not the spirit stray, then the heart will settle.
Fortunate to have Master Cuī’s *Yào Jìng* [药镜].

If one attains ultimate truth,
The Whole Truth steadies, rooted in stillness.
Master and guest—inner clarity, outer response—
The *Líng Tái* [灵台] radiates celestial brilliance.
Two jars, one scene.

Hasten your cultivation—
Do not wait until thirst drives you to dig the well.

---
**Part Three**
Nurture essence to root the spirit, guard *qi*—
Heaven’s child and mother never part.
Keep this in mind day and night, through all six hours.

Within the *Three Fields* [三田],
Warm, harmonious—heaven and earth’s balanced water.
Before the Twelve Towers, white snow clings;
By the Nine Palaces, yellow sprouts rise.
At the Sun-Moon Mountains, we pay homage to the Emperor.

Spirit-light ascends—
The body soars beyond the misty heights.

---
**Part Four**
I possess a luminous pearl with no price—
Its light eternally shines upon the *Zhī Tián* [芝田].
No *zhī* or *hū* [之乎] here.

Few are the true listeners in this world.
A million rays of essence, spirit-guarded—
Four hundred and four ailments vanish.
The Fire Dragon returns to *Zào Huà* [造化].

The immortal chariot departs—
Not a speck of dust follows the steed.

---
**Song: *Cù Pāi Mǎn Lù Huā* [促拍满路花]**
Embracing the Primordial, one can guard the One—
The Four Great Elements then rest in ease.
The heart must reflect inward—
How often does it find leisure?

The Golden Crow surges—
Flying into the molten silver basin.

Heart is Dao—
Dao is in the heart—
Where else should one seek the elixir?

---
**Part Two**
Why cling to robes and honors,
Desiring to transcend the world?
Glory lasts but a few days—
Then it withers and falls.

Cultivating the True is easy,
But piling up deeds and merits is hard.
I urge you to do good—
The Five Turbidities, the Three Realms—
Transformed into cloud-isles, spirit mountains.

---
**Part Three**
If one remains ever serene and still,
Heaven and earth all return to it.
One True contains all marvels—
Entering *Xī Yí* [希夷].

Zhāo Wén [昭文] does not comprehend—
*Qi* and climate have their gains and losses.
Deluded thoughts extinguished,
Hunger, sleep, action—all cease.

---
**Part Four**
The furnace and cauldron form naturally—
Luster shines through the curtains.
Jade Pool’s spirit-water surges—
Above, fertility blooms.

Like fish drinking water—
Cold and warmth, each knows its own.

One’s own life and fate—
One’s own enlightenment—
One’s own life and fate is most convenient.

---
**Part Five**
Speaking of cultivation and nurturing—
How many paths exist?
Truly, return to the source—
The Void Origin.

The Ultimate Truth, the Ultimate Dao—
Simple, encompassing heaven and earth.
*Kǎn* and birds, water and fire—
Just a net and snare,
Yet one enduring point remains.

---
**Part Six**
If one truly offers incense here,
The *Five Thousand Words* are understood.
Golden crystal flies past the elbow—
Piercing Kunlun’s heights.

The Clear River winds nine bends—
A single oar cuts through the misty gloom.
Striking water for three thousand *lǐ*,
Ninety thousand *péng*’s journey—
All transforms into the Original Void.

---
**Song: *Jiāng Shén Zǐ* [江神子] (Slow)**
In groves and springs, I cultivate my simplicity.
Freeing my spirit, lazy in worldly ties—
My resolve is iron.

Lofty and detached,
A taste of truth amid idle talk.
By day, I wander—
Wild cranes on the cliffs are my Dao companions;
Beneath the pine pavilion, the smoke lingers still.

At night, I listen alone to the lone monkey—
On the high peak, it howls at the moon.

When my deeds are complete and my path fulfilled,
I ride the auspicious clouds
To the Jade Pool’s celestial gate.

---

**Song: *Jiāng Shén Zǐ* (Slow) – Continued**
When my spirit roams, the *luán* cranes and *hè* herons await to greet me.
Dancing in azure void,
Celestial banners drift to welcome my audience.
At the Peach Spring Gathering, the *qiónglín* feast—
Now I trustfully part ways.

Reaching here, boundless freedom,
As a guest of the *Pénglái* Isles.
Spring descends from heaven—
Delighting in the Dao, content in poverty.
I sigh at ancient heroes,
Who, in groves beneath the trees, find no one.
Their halls filled with gold and jade—
Yet they claim to bestow it upon their children and grandchildren.

Ultimately, it belongs to kin.
Ask why, from the start, with nothing to possess,
Greed and love led them astray.
Early, they should have withdrawn—
To the *Huá’ān Gōng* within the *Kuí’ān* Palace,
Yet they labored their spirits so.

Morning mushrooms and *fúchú* cicadas—
Brief lives indeed—
How could they believe the *hú* jar
Holds another spring of eternal youth?

For now, I roam ten thousand *lǐ*,
Part for a thousand years,
Returning on the backs of *fèng* phoenixes and *lín* unicorns.
Reflecting on life’s fleeting moment—
How often have I seen the *cānghǎi* waves stir dust?

Do not linger.
Those who boast of empty splendor,
Lightly betraying the pure *tiānzhēn*—
Their jade-embrace is but a hollow belly.

If speaking of profound mysteries,
Listen to the *Zhōufēng* teachings in one breath.
Take the infant *zhēn* and the maiden *nǚ*—
Separate them by wood and metal.
Distinguish them from the beginning.

First, subdue the Six Thieves and annihilate the Three Corpses.
Then, capture the Jade Hare to drink the Black Blood of the Ox.
Wield the sword’s edge,
Drive away demonic barriers,
Dispel the *qín* heresy.
All depends on resolve fierce and bold.

Those methods—how most wondrous!
Dragons flee, tigers scatter,
Coming and going, unrestrained.
The two beasts captured—how could I abandon them?
Furnace refining, cauldron tempering—
No pause, no respite.

The supreme treasures of *Yīnyáng* and *qiánkūn*,
Guiding the fate of turtles and snakes.
The East Chicken crows, the West River Moon ascends.
I join the *Huángtíng* in admiring white snow.

*Shàngdān* warms, *zhōngdān* cozens, *xiàdān* blazes.
The Three Fields’ treasures are bound.
All the immortals lift me to the Golden Gate.

The lofty realm of *Liáoyáng*—
How could I ever describe it?

---

**Song: *Shuǐdiào Gētóu* [水调歌头]**
Where the Five *Xíng* are absent, before *qì* takes form—
A resplendent clarity, alone transcending the *Wúhé Xiāng*.
The sun and moon? How could they reflect it?
The heavens and earth? How could they contain it?
Its brilliance is boundless, wondrous beyond measure.

Thanks to the bamboo ravine’s water,
Now I pass the message to the world.

Vague and dim,
Faint and hazy,
Deep and still—
These truths, even with a thousand mouths,
Would be hard to convey.

Cutting off all branching paths,
Excluding every clever scheme,
Mooring the fishing boat.

Ask not of past deeds—
Sit quietly in one furnace’s smoke.

---

**Song: *Sū Mù Zhē* [苏幕遮]**
Gold within the water,
Charging the Ox and the Dipper.

---

**Song: *Yùsuǒ Jīnguān* [玉锁金关]**
Jade locks and golden gates—
Guardian spirits of the Law keep watch.
At the Vermilion Water’s elixir foundation,
Dragons and tigers surge and roam.
All things manifest in their teeming array,
Bursting forth from the Pearl Mouth’s embrace.
Drink the Spirit Elixir,
Master the Fire’s clarity.

When the Great Unity Furnace opens,
Divine light shines through—
Transient fame and gain dissolve like mist.
Act swiftly now to plumb the void’s birth,
Extracting the nonexistent from the nothing.

**Song: *Jiěpèi Lìng* [解佩令]**
For those who cultivate the Dao,
Their labor is no small feat.
Know the Five *Xíng*’s rise and fall—
Reversed or inverted, their order’s lost.
Profound mysteries within profound,
Where the Jade Furnace coils with dragons,
And tigers circle the Golden Cauldron—
Refining the supreme treasure.

When the Yang Spirit departs the body,
Dark and boundless—
In an instant, traversing the Three Isles.
Entering and exiting with perfect ease,
Pressing down to seek deeper mysteries.
Merge with the True Void—
The Great Emptiness is complete.

**Song: *Shuāngdiào Yàn’ér Luòdé Shènglìng* [双调·雁儿落得胜令]**
To feast at the *Pántáo* banquet of tortoiseshell halls,
No need for imperial wine or jade-lined feasts.
Abandon the strife for name and gain,
Nurture the will to refine the nature, perfect the Dao.

Better to sleep wrapped in paper blankets,
Brewing tea and elixirs by the furnace’s glow.
Watch the deer on flower-crowned peaks,
Monkeys bearing fruit from the mountain’s crest.
Ascend to the Celestial Court in the Golden Pavilion of Leisurely Yang,
Rest in peace within the *Pénglái* grotto’s embrace.

**Song: *Shuāngdiào Tiánshuǐ Lìng* [双调·甜水令]**
Hemp ropes and straw sandals, wind-tossed sleeves—
No craving for fame or gain.
Rain hat and fishing rod in hand,
Green waters flowing eastward.

**Song: *Shuāngdiào Zhéguì Lìng* [双调·折桂令]**
A single leaf boat amid the waves,
Seeking the finest streams and peaks to wander.
Lost in whimsy, forgetting all else,
In drunkenness, what matter seasons or years?
Like *Xǐ’ěr* washing his ears by the stream,
Laughing at *Zhuāng Zhou*’s butterfly dream,
A thatched hut in secluded quiet.
Pulling the blanket over his head,
The sun climbs three poles—
Deep sleep, no worries.

---
**其二**
At ease, drifting through boundless freedom,
Gardens become delight, a lone tree as bridge.
Even if wealth and rank weigh heavy,
The sea of strife is vast and turbulent.
Better to abandon gain and fame—
Straw shoes, coarse hemp robe—
No hairpins, no jade belts.
Drink rough wine till drunk,
Feast at the *Pántáo* banquet.
Stroll through cloudy mountains,
Visit fishermen and woodcutters in idle hours.

---
**其三**
Life is a leaf falling from its branch,
A hundred years—
Wasted in darkness, like sand slipping through fingers.
How wasted! Men mistake it for madness.
Riches and honor are like hemp cloth in flames,
Glory like crossing rivers to hunt tigers.
What’s the use of scheming?
Time flees like a shuttle—
Ten years’ life, a dream in *Nánguō*.

---
**其四**
Better to drift like foam on water’s surface
Than seek fame at the pass—
Take joy in rustic tilling, hidden in mist and clouds.
Laugh at *Bāoxū* weeping at Qin’s gates,
Observe *Shàopíng* hoeing melons by *Qīngmén*,
*Yuānmíng* planting chrysanthemums by the eastern hedge.
Midday drunkenness fades to sober stillness,
Sitting alone in the thatched pavilion.
Striking a simple drum, reciting *Dàodé* and *Huángtíng*.

---
**Song: *Shuāngdiào Yàn’ér Luòdé Shènglìng* [双调·雁儿落得胜令]**
For fleeting life, my temples turn white,
Gazing in the mirror, youth has fled.
I’ve cast aside the white elephant’s burden,
Tightened the girdle of the golden fish.
Green willows lean against the gate,
Golden chrysanthemums bloom by the hedge.
I love the flowing water, clear as jade—
Why long for noble doors like endless seas?
Ah, how serene—
Brush the clouds from my sleeves beyond the white mists.
Like *Péngzé*—
Returning in tranquil ease.

---
**其二**
Time flows like water, day and night shift,
Worldly dust erased in a stroke.
All things seen through—
Sleep with high pillows, no care in the world.
When bored, my staff leans past my head.
When hungry, a bowl of alms from a thousand homes.
When idle, wandering alone for ten thousand miles.
My gaze rests on *Làngyuán*’s splendid scenery;
Lifting my head, *Pénglái*’s hidden wonders unfold.

---
**其三**
Honor and wealth flicker like lamp flames in the wind,
Riches are but a dream beneath the *huái* tree.
Just as the Six Dynasties celebrated peace,
The Twelve Kingdoms stirred with war’s chaos.
The human sea teems with false dragons and phoenixes,
The floating world hides true heroes.
Recall *Chǔ*’s *Yuànshuài*, *Zhōu*’s *Jiāng Tàigōng*—
What use is glory? All is but a *Nánguō* dream.

---
**Song: *Shuāngdiào Tiánshuǐ Lìng* [双调·甜水令]**
Refining elixirs in the furnace,
Thunder shakes the *túmiáo* grass.
With moonlit staff and clear wind,
No need for gourd or bowl.

**Look again—midlife has already passed,**
With silver hair abundant at my temples.

What use are heaps of jade and gold?
I live only wrapped in dreams.

---
**Third: The Monkey-Minded and the Horse-Willed**
Only when the *monkey-mind* and *horse-will* are tamed,
Why then do I not vie for fame?
Even as a *goldfish in a scholar’s jar*,
Or a *jade slipper* in the hands of the elite—
I ride a *white horse with red tassels*,
A *public minister* in name, yet free in spirit.

---
**Song: *Water Nymph* [水仙子]**
*Zhang Guo Lao* of the Han:
Ascending beyond mortal to the *sage’s realm*,
Who helped me down the *jade stair* from intoxication?
My *fan* circles like a *barbarian’s mustache*,
My skin red as *clouds of vermilion*.
My companions: *tea, medicine, chess, and lute*.
My hair is *double-peaked* [双髻],
My robes are *patchwork* [百衲].

Once I visited *Làngyuán*’s *Jade Pool*.

---
**Second: Lu Dongbin**
After parting my *drunken soul*,
I descended from the *Broad Cold Palace* [廣寒宮],
Flying to the *Twelve Peaks* [瑶台].
All because of a *yellow millet dream*,
I gained the *transformative power* of the immortals.
At my side, *jade maidens* and *golden boys*.
I pluck *immortal herbs* for a *thousand-year lifespan*,
Refining *elixir sands* through the *Nine Turnings* [九转].
Each day, I *subdue tigers and dragons*.

---
**Third: Lan Caihe**
With *western winds* sweeping my *green brocade robe*,
I stumble drunk before the palace steps each day.
My *hat of official rank* lolls askew at my brow,
I toss *gold coins* in my hands.
I battle and scheme with the *lowly scholars*,
Singing wild songs to the *rhythm of sandalwood boards*—
*"Ah, let me be!"*—
Ever joyous, ever carefree.

---
**Fourth: Xu Shenong**
No love for *thieves or slaves to wives*,
I dwell alone in *smoke and mist*, cold and detached.
I care not for *gold and silver treasures*,
My body is clad in *ragged, threadbare garments*.
My clothes are *tattered and torn*,
My life is *chilly and simple*—
I wander the world at *leisure*.
A *gourd* is strapped to my back.

---
**Fifth: Zhang Guolao**
Hunched and bent, sixty years old,
My snow-white head and beard mark my age.
I roam the *path of red dust* on clouds,
Riding high on a *white cloud-donkey*.
At *Zhào Zhōu City*, I crushed the *stone bridge*.
I lean on a *speckled bamboo staff*,
And wear a *coarse hemp robe*.
Once, too, I drank deep at the *peach banquet*.

---
**Sixth: Cao Guojiu**
A *minister of the Jade Hall* and *Golden Horse*,
Now I am but a *Kunlun Peak* recluse.
No *yellow gold seal* hangs at my waist—
I follow *Lu Dongbin* in idle ease.
Beneath *forests and springs*, I cultivate my *nature* and *refine my essence*.
A *golden plaque* at my belt,
A *winnowing basket* in my hand.
No longer do I serve as *royal kin or noble retainer*.

---
**Seventh: Li Yue**
My *brushwork* does not encroach on *official duties*—
I leap into the *happy realm of eternal life*.
My *fine black robes* are torn to rags,
My *iron crutch* drags in my hand.
My hair stands wild as *pine needles*.
Who would have thought I’d *recline in slumber again*,
My teeth still *snow-white* in song?
Each day, I *drift in joyous, aimless abandon*.

**Eighth: Han Xiangzi**
My life is *elixir cauldron* and *scriptures*—
I have no fondness for *royal ministers* or *prime officials*.
Chaotic, the *auspicious snow* falls at *Blue Swallow Pass*,
Freezing Han Xiangzi’s horse.
Scattered wildly in midair, *Longsha’s* dust.
Black and crimson clouds surge,
Cold winds howl again.
Flowers bloom atop the mountain.

---
**Pure Yang True Person’s Hundred-Character Diagram**
My nature loves *purity and stillness*,
Taming the *monkey-mind* with *steadfastness*.
I drink no wine—
I’ve abandoned desire entirely.
I covet no wealth—
I compete in no *qi*.
Though seen, I do not observe;
Though heard, I do not listen.
I judge no one’s faults—
Only my own afflictions I seek.
When I meet the unruly, I guard my *root-nature*.
In office, I avoid *renown*;
In private, I act with *trustworthy conduct*.
Not counted among men,
I escape the *chest’s oppression*.
Blending with the light, mingling with the dust,
I mix only with *mundane emotions*.
Why do I not vie for *name*?
Once, I debated this with *high masters*.

---
**Poem by Master Liu Langran**
For decades, I’ve been *cast off*, drunk on *vast cups*,
Each day indulging my *nature* until noon.
The *Tail Gate* opens, the *Dirt Mound* acupuncture point transparent—
The *elixir furnace* divides *creation’s authority*.
Only this path to the *clouds* must have its way,
For my fate was never shaped by *Heaven*.
Do not say the *Great Dao* is hard to grasp—
It’s that *common folk* refuse to study *transcendence*.

---
**Second**
For decades, I’ve wandered *north and south*,
Silently practicing *mysterious principles*, refining *truth*.
I seek not the world’s *endless things*,
Only to find *myself* within the *cosmos*.
Having awakened, I know *ebb and flow*—
*Inner Elixir* ever flows upstream.
Even if we meet again after a thousand years,
It’s as fresh as today’s new dawn.

---
**Third**
In *Jingluo’s* secluded stillness,
I dwell in an ancient *observatory* east of the *moat*.
Though *worldly emotions* stain others, not me,
I treat *dusty affairs* as *Dao* treats them differently.
Refining *elixirs* is no labor of a thousand days’ suffering,
Circulating *essence* keeps my limbs ever *permeated*.
What the world treasures most is precious—
Apart from the *human body*, all is *emptiness*.

---
**Fourth**
In my *seeking-Dao* days, chaos reigned—
I traversed mountains and rivers like clouds.
I studied *longevity* by chasing *external things*,
Yet never heard the *True Path*.
My *yang essence* lost its *harmonious qi*,
*Gold and stone* labored in vain, heated by *foreign fire*.
Alas, the *common folk* fail to awaken—
They gladly rot in *wilds*, becoming *mounds of dust*.

---
**Fifth**
Abandon the *Nine Classics* and *Three Histories*—
They are of no use to the *body*.
Better to preserve *original harmony* and *qi*,
And tend the *great elixir furnace*.
Retaining *true essence* will save you from *old age*,
Refining *golden substance* will pierce the *void*.
If you don’t know the *path of longevity*,
What use are the *common folk’s* deluded natures?

---
**Sixth**
Seeking *nobility* and *wealth* is endless—
What use are *high offices* and *extreme riches*?
Better to wield *authority* with *light heart*,
Than to endure *poverty* with *self-contentment*.
Leaning on a *crooked pillow*, I let spring days stretch—
Circulating *essence*, I spare not a hair’s decline.
When we meet again beyond *things*,
Surely we’ll be *immortals* with a *predestined bond*.

---
**Seventh**
*True lead* and *true mercury* are not hard to find—
It’s that *common folk* misuse their *minds*.
*Moon’s shadow* and *sun’s soul* are clear and easy,
But *wood’s essence* and *fire’s timing* run deep.
Nine years of toil refining *essence*—
*Alchemical transformations* awaken the *five metals*.
To leave the world, one grain suffices—
*Kunlun* and *Penglai* will know your *harmony*.

---
**Eighth**
The *double spine* and *dual channels* reach the *crown*—
This is the *root path* of cultivation.
Frequently swallow *Jiachi Pool’s* *jade nectar*,
Let *Zifu’s* *Yuan Lord* ascend.
Make your *qi* surge through *passages and joints*,
Then *essence* will naturally fill the *Valley Spirit*.
When you attain *longevity’s realm*,
You’ll thank the one who first taught you.

---
**Ninth**
Heaven’s net loosely ensnares the *ten thousand forms*,
A pine’s fall makes *Hua Mountain* wither.
After cold clouds pass, a *lonely moon* remains,
When *winter snow* arrives, it faces the *Great Void*.
*Dragon and serpent* return to *Zifu’s* *Purple Palace*,
*Thousand-year cranes and phoenixes* descend to *Cangwu*.
Since parting from my master,
There are few *true men* in *east, west, north, or south*.

---
*Langranzi*, a native of *Qi*.
After following *Emperor Xuanzong of Tang* to *Shu*,
He encountered *Divine Master Sima Chengzhen’s* oral instructions,
Received the *Great Elixir* *Golden Liquid* formula,
And after successful cultivation, returned to *Luoyang*.
Local elders say that during the *Song Endong* era,
*Langranzi* died drunk in *Peach Blossom Alley*.
At the time, heavy snow fell, yet within a *ten-foot radius* of his corpse,
Not a single flake touched the ground.
Officials examined the body—
Only *gold cicadas* entered and exited his *nose, mouth, and ears*,
Then flew into the sky.
All gazed upward, and when they looked back,
The corpse was gone.

*A Daoist of the Wànlíng Cháoyuàn*, *Zhao Yinwei*,
Collected *Langranzi’s* poems, raised funds to carve them on stone,
And spread his teachings.
He knocked at my door, showed me these verses,
And I, having carefully examined them,
Found them no more than *qi-circulation* and *saliva-swallowing*,
*Nurturing yang* and *dismissing yin*—
Consistent with my own practice.
Thus, I happily inscribed this in writing.
*Huángtǒng* first year, third month, second day,
*Fānghú Zhīzú* respectfully records.

**太空歌**
*Mǎ Dānyáng*

The Way may be spoken, yet not the constant Way,
Still and unmoving—eternally preserved.
Guard the cold radiance piercing boundless void,
One offering of pristine clarity, luminous and pure.

The Law may be taught, yet not by any law,
Clear and deep—all conditions extinguished.
Then know: neither birth nor death remains,
Ancestral debts and grudges now severed clean.

What is born? What dies?
Still and clear, clear and still.
Since recognizing such luminous truth,
One knows the nature of thought preserves the life.

Seek not the True, discard not the False,
For in seeking and discarding, cunning arises.
Once cunning arises, the True is abandoned—
Yet fleeing the blade, you meet the butcher’s knife.

Not yet walked, not yet seen,
To extinguish life is hard, yet harder still.
Walk one step, awaken one step—
Without walking, vainly boasting of Chang’an’s path.

You have not yet awakened—do not force praise,
Nor claim the void is one unified house.
When the heart is not yet clear, speak not of the Way,
Like a blind man gazing at a lotus in bloom.

This side fair, that side foul,
Luring the ox to wander recklessly.
If the mind’s eye is not yet bright,
Close your eyes, still your heart, and seal your lips.

No need for hands, no need for ropes,
No need to bind or grasp tightly.
Without intent, the wind’s shadow is seized—
Spontaneously, motion and stillness both forgotten.

Neither clinging to scripture nor rejecting it,
In dual dissolution, inner and outer dwell.
Abandoning the path, speech falters;
Clinging to text, you lose your own pearl.

Mind is Zen, nature is the Way,
Each step contested—how much more?
A teacher’s single finger points to the root—
The Stone Man claps, laughing heartily.

Zen as the lineage, the Way as the ancestor,
Shattering metal, wood, water, fire, earth.
Luminous radiance interpenetrates true void—
Yet laughs at one, two, three, four, five.

Lineage and method both unified,
Only true practice and true virtue suffice.
When virtue and practice are fulfilled,
Only a point illuminates the cold sky.

Neither Way nor Zen,
Fathomless and obscure—naturally unified.
All things stripped bare by the pure eye,
The void resounds, boundless and bright.

---

**悟真歌**
*Féng Zūnshī*

Awakened within awakening, enlightened within insight,
A single spark of luminous light, unobstructed.
Unleash the fierce flame to illuminate *Sādhāra*’s world,
The *Dharma-realm* stretches vast, yet stands alone revealed.

These subtle messages, so profound,
A wooden man points afar—clouds return in vain.
This mystic gate defies description,
Yet seen in the moment, forgotten at once.

Not the tangles of an old woman’s tongue,
But the genuine compassion of wondrous truth.
A moon’s wheel lifted by a staff,
A furnace’s red flame cradling spring’s snow.

I was originally a *Great Awakening* immortal,
With fate, I grasped the ancestor’s Zen.
Returning, a song—no one responds,
Jade bamboos and yellow flowers, natural and free.

In the painted hall, incense smoke drifts fine,
In vain I sigh like *Manjuśrī* inquiring of illness.
At *Caoxi*’s stream, the moon is bright, the wind pure,
Golden lotuses bloom across *Jeta*’s grove.

Shouldering the tiger-staff, I return home,
Snow seals the mountain path—no passage now.
Who at this moment understands my ease?
Only the few branches of plum will know.

Since recognizing the Way of Chang’an,
I love not idle flowers nor wild grass.
Deep in the night, the *kukku* cries on the bough,
Before the wine-jar, spring arrives anew.

At home, effortless joy in non-action,
Every touch reveals sacred form.
Not the thousand-eyed compassion,
Yet the jade maiden plucks forth ancient *Māni*.

What spell could illuminate this truth?
Fathomless, obscure—yet dimly glimpsed.
Ordinary beings fail to recognize this *Tathāgata*,
A lion’s den for the three ages’ Buddhas.

True leisure, true joy—whom to praise?
All are *crane-herons* trapped in a well’s depths.
A lone *kōkin* plucked to silence,
Green mountains still lock mist and cloud.

---

**证道歌**
*Lǚ Dòngbīn*

Awakening to the True yet failing to grasp life—
This is the first sickness of cultivation.
Merely cultivating *xìng* while neglecting the elixir,
A myriad kalpas of yin-spirits struggle to attain sainthood.

Grasping life’s foundation yet lost in ancestral nature,
Like a mirror without treasure—useless.
A man of heaven’s span, seizing yin and yang as his foundation.
Nature and life complete, profound yet deeper still—
A ship crossing the ocean’s surging waves.

Capturing alive the dragon-serpent’s form,
Only then does the artisan’s skill prove true.

---

**得道歌**
*Jǐngyáng*

The Way is hard to enter, hard to seek,
Easy to speak of—who can attain?
False paths deceive the world in myriad forms,
A thousand paths to the Way, yet only one true.

Some who study the Way now refuse to bow—
How pitiful!
Hiding from heaven, earth, and man,
Before attaining, they boast their success.

To become an immortal is not so hard,
Yet immortals must be born of immortal essence.
If not of immortal nature, do not presume,
For every move invites yin-demons’ grudges.

This matter is no small art,
Relying solely on virtue and conduct to shock the dark.

Sever delusion, extinguish greed,
Each step grounded in firm resolve.
If you grasp your true nature and heart as one,
Then I dare speak truly of the essence.

Cultivating the Golden Elixir is easy to begin,
Yet mastering *Zhōngyōng* and the *Yì* is key.
All doing and striving are ultimately vain,
Speaking of dragons only ends in tiger’s harm.

At the origin, movement stirs the body,
If further confused, punishment follows.
Ever recall the undivided chaos before differentiation,
Mysteries unspeakable—nature’s heart is clear.

The body’s every part belongs to yin,
Yet one thing holds yang-essence—man does not know.
Round and steady, it follows like a shadow,
Neither void nor form, yet neither color nor substance.
Dispersed through all things, filling heaven and earth,
Within one thing lies the *Tàijí*.
Retreating, it hides in the profound unity of nature—
Seen, yet unseen; sought, yet unfound.

My elixir’s secret is uniquely mine,
No need for days, months, or years.
No fire’s timing, no adding or subtracting,
No separation of self and other, flaw or merit.
Neither birth nor death, nor anything to cultivate or speak of.
When hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.
At leisure, sit in meditation; when lazy, rest.

「When food is met, it is consumed; when wine is met, it is drunk,
No fasting or observance—only the heart’s clarity remains.

Riches and honor mean nothing to the mind,
Fame and gain, strife and dispute—all are severed.

Still and concentrated, nurturing the *yuánshén*,
No thought arises—true reality is distinct.

True reality is distinct—self-satisfied,
Day and night, the moon within the mind is seen.
No coming, no going—just the center,
Piercingly bright, all eight extremes illuminated.

Neither full nor lacking,
Like a red furnace’s single snowflake.

Though this moment is attained,
Only when void and space are shattered is it fully understood.

Leisurely and free, joyfully unrestrained,
Human vexations do not touch this mind.

Seekers of the Dao, seize the time—
A hundred years pass like lightning.

If not grasped now, great foolishness ensues,
Do not wait till old age when *qi* and spirit are spent.

Swiftly turn back, fiercely cut through—
One stroke, two divisions, blood must flow.
To shed the mortal form and take the dharmic,
Refine this single thought as iron.

These words are spoken with deep intent—
All heavenly secrets are now revealed.
If students hear them lightly,
Fear only regret at death’s door.

**Heart’s Assignment**
For the Three True Ones

Worldly affairs are endless, yet all are void.
Having entered the Mysterious Gate’s teachings,
Work must be done on the heart’s foundation.

Great wisdom is serene, undisturbed,
In the stillness of the unborn—tranquil and boundless.
True essence is silent, unspoken,
Free in the midst of absolute cessation.

To cultivate the eternal seed of life,
First, hold the heart’s foundation firm.
Six senses purified, a thousand afflictions extinguished,
Three realms emptied, all entanglements resolved.

Perception, hearing, awareness—
These are the roots of obstruction to the Dao.
Calm and pure, devoid of desire—
This is the great principle of sustaining the true.

If one is steadfast in learning the Dao,
One must fully awaken the heart.
When the heart is still, solitary clarity shines alone,
When the heart remains, all phenomena intrude.

The true form is neither lacking nor excessive—
Visible even in life;
Illusory appearances, though shaped, are ever impermanent—
What use is there in seeking them?

Knowing all dharmas are empty,
All ties abandoned—
Sitting in practice, this is the Dao’s madness.

Giving aid and spreading kindness—
This is virtue’s deceit.
Great skill feigns clumsiness,
Then one knows all things are effortless;
Good plans are not schemes,
Only let go each and every thought.

Let the single heart remain unmoved,
All actions will be complete.
Each day, exhilarate the spirit,
Truly know life’s joy in harmony with Heaven.

Through spring, summer, autumn, and winter,
Eat when hungry, drink when thirsty;
Or facing wind, flowers, snow, and moon,
Walk steadily and sleep in peace.

If one can meet all things without attachment,
Acting in each scene as play—
The Dao is already complete within the inch of heart,
Why labor through countless lifetimes?

Yǒngjiā once enlightened,
Forced to linger one night before returning;
Lúxíng still doubted,
Wasted time till the third watch came.

Thus, all things are empty,
All dust is discarded—
Beyond nature, no true substance exists,
Before the eyes, all is illusion’s bubble.

Eternal life has form yet blends unseen,
Even spirits cannot fathom it;
The Great Symbol is formless, everywhere present,
Heaven and earth cannot contain it.

Indeed, the fundamental truth is to clarify the heart—
Why toil with weary resolve?
It cannot be borrowed from another,
Only through self-mastery is it realized.

Grand discourse forgets words,
True scriptures transcend letters—
Relying on the crow’s cry to proclaim,
Falling blossoms to point the way,
Stone women teaching in person,
Wooden men receiving the gift.

Shallow minds with little insight
Say, "No, not so!"
Enlightened ones with vast vision
Say, "Indeed, just as this!"」

The awakened dwell in boundless ease,
The lost stumble through thorns at every step.

To seek the supreme attainment beyond heaven,
One must cast aside all worldly concerns.

**Eight Principles of Chan**

Master Feng’s teaching:
Dao has no gradual or sudden—
Chan knows no before or after.
The lost wander beyond eons,
The enlightened stand before their eyes.

Neither coming nor going,
Mastering the Six Powers in freedom;
Neither birth nor death,
Transcending the Three Realms in solitary perfection.

Unshaken by clamor,
Unbound by ease.
The five sects’ disciples,
Cling to fabricated knowledge;
The One Vehicle’s adherents,
Also indulge in illusion.

Only when ever-present clarity shines,
And all burdens are released—
A thousand winds through the pines,
Stone women sing between the branches;
Three moonbeams on the ridge,
Pastoral boys tumble in the light.

Innate wisdom dawns,
Sudden luminosity unfolds.
When circumstances arise, nature manifests;
Before forms, the heart must fade.

The Four Symbols merge,
The Three Talents harmonize.
Green waters flow eternally—
Though you rot and decay;
Blue mountains stand firm—
As clouds drift, they drift away.
Everlasting through ancient and present,
Unwithering, unperishing.

The dull are ensnared by sound and color,
The enlightened transcend all existence.
Scattering wind and cloud,
Caressing stars and constellations.
The hollow lute’s melody—
Wooden horses roar before the hall;
The snow-melting tune is rare—
Jade dragons race beneath the sea.

Do not seek East-West Bodhisattvas,
Nor hunt South-North Amitābha.
Wherever the eye turns, the Dharma-realm is present—
Where is there no Chan?

When one grasps this truth,
Only then may one attain suchness.

Dwelling in dust yet transcending it,
Not falling into the Six Demons’ snares.
Encountering origin on all sides,
Silent illumination returns to primal purity.

Old women’s gossip, a thousand eons of bone-trading;
Direct pointers to the numinous source—
A single absolute utterance.

Seizing freedom, killing and living stand alone.
White clouds and green cliffs—
Every peak is true suchness;
Emerald bamboo and golden flowers—
Every thing is pure awakening.

Erasing all boundaries, encompassing the great thousand—
He who displays the flower to the assembly
Truly overreaches;
He who shouts at the Buddha and curses the Ancestors
Also errs.

Who understands the step-by-step lotus?
Returning from the Deer Park,
The moon fills the riverboat.

Drawing forth one’s own family wind,
Instantly surpassing the Ten Bhūmis;
Shattering the stubborn void’s illusion,
Alone feasting the heavenly hosts.

A worthless fool dares to bicker—
All are but dregs;
Who gnaws at public cases
Cannot fathom profound truth.
Off by a hair’s breadth,
Missed by a thousand leagues.

The Wooden Man says:
*To know the Western Intent,
One must drain the marrow of the Golden Nirmāṇa Devas.*

**On Recognizing Heart and Mind**

If one seeks cultivation,
First recognize heart and mind,
Then awaken nature.

What is heart?
What is mind?
That which perceives is heart;
Thousands of thoughts, millions of musings—this is mind.

Mind arises from thought,
Heart is born from things.
The root of arising and generation
Lies within the inch-square.

This inch-square—
The original true heart.
Heart has no heart,
Mind has no mind.

Because familiar scenes are hard to forget,
The heart drifts, the mind stirs,
And true heart is obscured, unseen.
One must still the heart, settle the mind,
And inwardly observe the heart.

The stillness, unmoving—this is *dhyāna*;
Awareness within stillness—this is *prajñā*.
*Dhyāna* is essence,
*Prajñā* is function.
When both are complete,
They never wane day by day.

**On Serenity**

To love broadly is to be muddled—
Who can cherish purity?
Entangled in myriad cares,
I alone keep one life serene.
Break free from the deepest chains,
Ever dwell in tranquility;
Avoid the gnats and flies’ snares,
Awaken to luminous clarity.

The ancients said:
*Cut all worldly ties,
Uphold the primal order.*
To play in the boundless void of Great Purity,
One must root deeply and stand firm;
To dwell in true simplicity and leisure,
One must rejoice in eternal life and keen vision.

When this truth is known,
The heart becomes clear as autumn water;
All movements in time
Are subtle as spring winds rising.

Standing alone, yet upright—
Silent, yet present.
Unblemished yet not rigid—
Like a mirror revealing beauty and flaw;
Luminous yet without favor—
Like the moon illuminating heaven and earth.

Upright in singular nature,
Calm in the Six Roots.
Numinous purity stands aloof,
Like pine and cypress in virtue;
Lawful vastness unfolds,
Beyond the gate of the Mysterious and Primordial.

In the world, the body returns to the lone cloud,
Emotions rise like wild cranes.
Subtle and wondrous, it hides mountains in marshes;
Beyond thought, it buries elixir in valleys.
Pure and transparent, boundless and free—
The spirit soars to Guishan’s realm;
Self and objects forgotten,
The steps tread the void’s expanse.

Ultimately, this is not the private domain of the Sage—
It is what one makes of it.
If one does not abandon name and gain,
How can one awaken to the rare and lofty?

The great sage speaks leisurely,
Echoing the South Mountain’s words;
The petty man frets endlessly,
Hearing Confucius’ teachings in vain.

As for those who practice Chan amid desire,
Carrying their families’ burdens while preaching subtlety—
They must earn the respect of the lowest fool,
And avoid the scorn of the virtuous.

One must only quietly cultivate,
Turning toward leisure’s reflection.
To exhaust emptiness and uphold stillness firmly—
This is Laozi’s family tradition;
To discard limbs and abandon cleverness—
This is Yan Yuan’s essential key.

When heart and method both vanish,
Life and death are cast aside.
Through pure refinement, the Dao is perfected;
Through empty leisure, the Mysterious is pierced.

Having abandoned the causes of defilement,
The universe grows desolate;
Sealing the breath of non-action,
One laughs among the clouds.

Strange—
Ants toil for food, moths perish in flame.
Why cling to this sinking suffering?
Who would perfect virtue’s nature?

Alas—
Better to hear early of leisure and purity,
And return to the Celestial Metropolis to worship the Emperor.

**On Perfect Truth**

Divine and saintly grace descends,
Mercy spreads universally.

**On the Dao of Perfect Truth**

Having embraced the vast expanse of the Mysterious Teaching,
I now reverently uphold the Dao of Perfect Truth.
Who would have known that the tenfold heights of the High Immortals
Descend to wander in this mortal world;
That the Great Explication of the Three Sovereigns’ ancient Way
Harmonizes with the transformations of humanity?

The roots of virtue permeate all schools,
Yet the heart returns to the One Rectitude.
Those who abandon the secular world sever ties with kin and love;
Those who endure hardship rejoice in Heaven’s decree and accept fate.
Thus, Perfect Truth is both learning and refining the nature.
Worldly fame and wealth, sensual pleasures—
View them as floating scum upon water;
Wisdom and insight—
Hold them sacred as the foremost saints of the Teaching.

For indeed, learning is not a rigid possession,
But a quest for the Great Way.
Amassing abundant virtue,
One extends compassion through skilful means;
Deeply cultivating and preserving,
One attains inner success.
To dwell in non-action’s clarity,
To seek the Way’s unity—
Objects are distinct as the bright moon in a clear pool;
Each response appears as the gentle wind through swaying grass.
All must be discerned in high and low,
And lifted in full awareness.
Learners have causes and fruits;
Those who realize transcend birth and death.
In utmost stillness and harmony,
In utmost firmness and purity—
Unifying the myriad virtues to interact with the world,
Never forsaking mercy;
Proclaiming the Three Teachings to awaken the lost,
Still honoring the wise and virtuous.
In essence, begging is no shame,
Nor is utter poverty a sorrow.
Bending oneself to benefit others,
One bestows kindness upon the aged and destitute;
Upholding lofty resolve and integrity,
One scorns kings and nobles with laughter.
This is the Perfect Truth’s heroic sage,
The Dao-realized Immortal stream.

Sudden enlightenment to Heaven’s mechanisms,
Broadcasts the Mysterious Wind through the Sacred Realm;
Widespread offerings of fragrant bait,
Universally seeks the knowing companions for the journey to the Isle of the Sea.
Thus, seeing clearly into things awakens the heart,
And knowing emptiness realizes the Dao.

**[Learning] the Perfect Truth’s Dao and methods,**
One must adhere to the teachings of Zhong and Lü;
**[Taking] the Great Way’s Mysterious principles,**
One must strictly follow the doctrines of Huang and Lao.
In pure stillness and simplicity,
Refining the Vermilion Elixir to extract Silver Threads;
In pristine subtlety,
Forging the Golden Treasure in the Cinnabar Cauldron.
Discarding false pretenses,
Revealing the natural.
Attaining the ever-more-wondrous essence of reality,
Obtaining the utterly complete True Function.
Five paths of silver clouds pierce the celestial vault,
One radiant wheel of moon illuminates the sky.
With crane’s carriage and golden scriptures,
One ascends to the Nine Yang Palace;
With peach wine and jade nectar,
One takes seat among the Ten Thousand Saints.

Alas—
Some remain in foolish delusion,
Engaged in petty disputes of self and others.
Those who declaim scriptures and proclaim the Teachings,
Do they truly grasp the Mysterious?
Those who deceive the middle and lower ranks,
Do not understand cause and effect.
One must depart the Fire Hall’s favors and the Mountain of Merit,
And withdraw from the bonds of name and gain.
Truly, if one wishes to know Perfect Truth’s essence,
Sudden enlightenment to emptiness is the path.

**The Emperor’s Ode to the Dao**

Within the Three Teachings, the Dao alone is most exalted.
Above, it does not bow to the Son of Heaven;
Below, it does not pay respects to ministers and officials.
Avoiding the secular world, it hides its traces;
Escaping the worldly net, it refines the True.
Scorning the forests and streams,
It rejects fame and profit;
Rejoicing in the mountains and valleys,
It forgets disgrace and glory.
Crowning with the Star Cap, it blazes like the sun;
Wearing coarse hemp robes, it nurtures eternal spring.
Some shave their heads and bare their feet,
Others tie their hair in a knot and wrap it in cloth.
Plucking Immortal flowers to weave hats,
Folding wild grasses to spread mats.
Drinking from the Sweet Springs to rinse the teeth,
Feasting on pine nuts to prolong life.
Singing with hand-drums, dancing until clouds gather—
With mountain companions, sharing tea in friendly conversation;
By riverside gatherings, lifting cups to discuss ancient texts.
Laughing at the vulgarity of lavish wealth,
Rejoicing in the ease of humble poverty.
Not a single hair’s obstruction,
Nor a speck of entanglement.
Some gather in threes to seek the Mysterious and inquire of the Dao,
Others converse in pairs on past and present.
Discussing past and present,
They sigh over the rise and fall of ancient worthies;
Seeking the Mysterious and inquiring of the Dao,
They clarify the essence of their own True Nature.
Enduring the shifts of cold and heat,
Completing the nine revolutions of the celestial tortoise and hare.
Graying hair returns to youth,
White hair turns green.
Carrying a bamboo lunchbox, they enter markets to beg for meals;
Gathering herbs to heal the world and aid humanity.
Some relieve suffering and benefit beings,
Others restore life from death.
Those who cultivate the Immortal Way have bones of utmost firmness and refinement,
Those who attain the Dao have spirits of peerless luminosity.
Forecasting fortune and misfortune, directing strange omens,
Determining calamity and blessing through subtle investigation of human affairs.
Expounding the Dao and elevating the Supreme Sage’s orthodox Teaching,
Applying talismans to dispel the world’s malevolent influences.
Subduing demonic forces with a wave of the hand,
Displaying *qi* at the Gate of Thunder.
Knocking upon Heaven’s gate, the True Immortals gather;
Striking the earth’s threshold, the myriad spirits respond.
Sitting in silent contemplation of the True,
Storing the spirit in a still chamber.
Seizing the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
Extracting the luminous essence of sun and moon.
Harmonizing yin and yang to refine the nature,
Adjusting water and fire to form the embryonic essence.
When the two eights of yin dissipate,
It seems as if lost in a dream;
When the three nines of yang flourish,
It vanishes like the distant night.
Adapting to the four seasons in gathering,
Nurturing the nine transformations to complete the elixir.
Riding the Azure Crane to ascend the Purple Palace,
Mounting the White Crane to pay homage to the Jade Capital.
Drawing upon Heaven’s refined *qi*,
Manifesting the Dao’s utmost devotion.
Compared to Confucianism,
Its officials hold high rank and splendid titles—
Wealth and honor are fleeting clouds.
Compared to Buddhism,
Its joy is in quiescence and extinction—
Yet it does not escape the secular dust.
I observe the Three Teachings,
And find the Dao alone most exalted.

**Record of the Ancestral Court**

The Ancestral Court once had no trace in Japan,
But Master Zhongyang illuminated and expounded the Mysterious Way.
His native home was in Chang’an, the capital of Jingzhao Prefecture,
And his ancestral residence was in the Taizi Village of Liquan.
Heaven sent down the Celestial Diagram, and Immortals descended;
Earth emitted auspicious light, and purple *qi* ascended.
His mother bore an Immortal embryo for two years,
And he was born in the fortunate era of Emperor Huizong of Song.
In the second year of Zhenghe (壬辰), the twelfth month, on the twenty-second,
The Emperor was born.
The Ancestral Master’s parents bore three sons,
And Master Zhongyang had two younger brothers.
As a child, he entered school to receive a sage’s instruction,
And mastered the Nine Classics and sacred texts.
At twenty-seven, he took the military examination,
And deeply understood the arts of war, drawing a hard bow.
With both literary and martial prowess,
He was feared by all.
The Song Dynasty hailed his virtue and might as a world-renowned hero.
His thoughts were clear as a mirror,
His words resounded like a bell.
Once at the Gansha River, he drank wine,
And there encountered two Immortal masters wrapped in coarse hemp robes.

「Five volumes of profound mysteries were received through direct transmission,
And seven orifices of spiritual insight revealed his merit.

Since drinking the waters of the Gansha River,
His heart opened vastly, and his faculties became clear.

At forty-eight, he encountered the True Teaching,
And abandoned the world to embrace the Dao, hidden within tombs.
He observed the inner landscape of reality,
And only then comprehended the Five Phases’ transformative power.

Piercing through the illusory and false forms,
He no longer inquired of mortal omens and portents.

Once again meeting the harmonious Li and dwelling in Liu Jiang,
The three of them resided together through three winters.

In thought, he reflected on the teachings of Qiu Liu, Tan Zhong, and Ma Yu,
And renamed himself as *Wang Haifeng* [王害风].

Fire consumed his thatched hut, and he left the land of Qin,
Departing the southeastern regions to descend to the east.

Three thousand miles away, he found a kindred soul,
And through nine transformations entered the Southern Capital.

The Master summoned his disciples with personal instructions:
“I shall return to the Pengleng [蓬瀛].”

In the tenth year of the Dading era (庚寅), at fifty-eight,
His lifespan ended.

At the *Cha Zi* [查子] shop, he ascended the path to Immortality,
Leaving behind the ancient traditions of the *Quanzhen* [全真] school.

Seven golden lotuses bloom at the hall’s entrance,
The *Changchun* [长春] and *Changjiao* [长教] lineages flourish within.

The teachings of *Quanzhen* [全真] in the *Qinghe* [清和] era are passed on,
And the *Hao* [浩然] sect thrives atop *Panshan* [盘山], south of the peaks.

*Dongzhen* [洞真], clad in white clouds, is the *Piyun* [披云] Master,
With boundless desirelessness, he ranks highest among all Immortal masters.

Eighteen senior masters gather here,
From the *Gengzi* [庚子] era, their deeds began.

Disciples from all under heaven come to lend their strength,
Daoists across the world contribute their efforts.

Heaven bestowed the craftsman *Cao Tidi* [曹提点],
And the halls were built in the *Shuizhu* [水竹] village.

Lofty and majestic, they rise a hundred feet high,
Jade-tiled roofs and tortoiseshell-like windows touch the heavens.

The southern mountain’s lion-like beast spits water,
Four beasts stand proud, their roars like winds of thunder.

Thousands of beams and arches arranged in the Eight Trigrams,
Five ridges and six beasts aligned with the Nine Palaces.

From afar, it resembles the summit of *Xumishan* [须弥],
And in the distance, it mirrors the grandeur of *Taihuafeng* [太华峰].

Above, it connects with clouds and the Northern Dipper,
Below, it descends to the Nine Abodes and Nine Springs.

〔Missing verse〕 The eight rivers behind the ridge all flow east.
A thousand rays of dawn enshroud the precious halls,
A thousand wisps of jade mist veil the ornate palaces.

Once, he saw cranes and phoenixes dancing in the sky,
And heard celestial music resounding from the Heavenly Palace.
All manifestations gathered to pay homage to the Jade Emperor,
The saints and Immortals presented offerings to the Three Pure Ones.

Deep within the crimson glow and violet mist, sealed tight,
White clouds and auspicious *qi* [气] are firmly locked within.

Scattered red peach blossoms and green bamboo intermingle,
Thousands of verdant trees and azure pines stand in harmony.

He wandered the boundless realms of heaven and earth,
And found no place more rare than the *Wang Zhongyang* [重阳] *Wanshou* [万寿] Palace.

At the hall’s entrance, *Zhao Zhenren* [赵真人] speaks:

*"The True One of the Primordial Dao,
Opens wide the gate to all marvelous mysteries.

The *Quanzhen* [全真] Way is fully realized,
And its teachings universally benefit all beings.

The fairy maidens of the *Yaochi* [瑶池],
The golden lotuses of *Wang Zhongyang*—seven blooms.

The *Langyuan* [阆苑] and *Jingong* [璚宫],
The *Changchun* [长春] lineage’s jade flowers—ten thousand leaves.

Though branches may diverge in detail,
All paths ultimately return to the root.

Though sects may vary in flow,
All rivers eventually merge into the sea.

He sets forth teachings in every direction,
Gathering clouds of friends from the four seas.

He sparks the *yuan* [缘] of the Dao in every place,
Summoning the misty companions of the Three Mountains.

Thatched huts and humble dwellings,
All become adorned with precious halls and ornate palaces.

Rough hemp robes and coarse attire,
Are graced with star-crowned caps and moon-trimmed cloaks.

It can be said that humans can magnify the Dao,
Expounding the rules of the ancient sages.

The Dao’s methods naturally align with humanity,
Opening the eyes of future generations.

At the *Liao Zhen* [了真] Hall, no trace of worldly attachment remains;
Under the *Wanxing* [万行] banner, all are urged to exert their efforts.

Those above must act with boundless compassion,
Those below must always hold reverence and obedience.

Worldly disputes cloud the mind,
And fail to grasp the essence of the *Quanzhen* [体玄] Way’s tradition.

Daoist insight unites in harmony,
Following the ancient practice of refining the *Danjiao* [丹肠].

From early times, he was a transcendent Immortal,
Now he serves as the Master’s *fahuai* [法眷].

Do not linger in the fleeting dust of mortal concerns,
Nor mock the precious pearls of a thousand sages.

In life, he shared in cultivating the Dao’s fruits,
And together ascended to transcend the mortal ranks.

The *Chujia* [出家] scholar, with clear vision, delves into the depths.
The *Licheng* [离尘] warrior, with pure heart, illuminates the path.

I humbly pray for your revered care.

*Feng Zunshi* [冯尊师]’s second verse:

The Supreme Dao is boundless and profound,
The wondrous Dao is rare and elusive.
Before heaven and earth, it was already present,
Not confined to words or texts.

Its light is luminous and void-pervading,
Filling all ten directions.
Its purity is clear and spiritually resonant,
Flowing through the Three Realms.

In endless transformations and changes,
It encompasses and governs yin and yang.
Its essence and function are eternally true,
Limitless and beyond measure.

Yet how can mortals, ensnared by heavy veils,
Bear its weight?

Valuing the ancient while scornful of the present,
They fabricate knowledge and understanding.
They debate the *Dharma* [法] and practice Zen,
But only open side doors to the Way.

From then on, the *Taiji* [太极] Primordial simplicity was lost,
And the teachings were divided into three gates.
Within the realm of emotions and perceptions,
They could not return to the origin.

To see these people thus,
One must deeply pity them.

Therefore, the Master widely opened the *fangbian* [方便],
And broadly spread the *cihang* [慈航] of compassion.

He universally rescued beings from suffering,
Freeing them from the six realms of transmigration.

He guided them back to the True Path,
And let them revel once more in the *Hongmeng* [鸿蒙] of primordial simplicity.

He broke open the gate of serene detachment,
And wandered freely through the *Qingdu* [清都] and *Jianguo* [降阙] of the celestial realms.

On the Five Clouds Platform,
He clearly transmitted the *Shuimi* [黍米] and *Xuanzhu* [玄珠];
Beside the Nine Luminaries Tower,
He raised high the *Han guang* [含光] treasure sword.

In boundless expanse, he moves with effortless freedom,
Pure and unobstructed, like the void itself.

In action and stillness, he transcends *wuwei* [无为],
Merging into the undifferentiated essence.

Thus, he can sweep away the *Sadā* [萨埵],
And playfully engage with *Bodhi* [菩提].

Neither death nor birth remain,
No excess, no deficiency.

Both saints and mortals are released,
Embracing the vastness of emptiness and form.

Even if the *nirūna* [泥牛] bellows at the moon,
Or the wooden horse whinnies in the wind,
Or the *lòutòu* [漏透] snares the mind,
Or the *jiāxiào* [作家] becomes a laughingstock—

With fiery words, he scolds the blue-eyed barbarian monks;
In silent illumination, he shatters the golden-maned lion.

The Five-Leaf Flower blooms in full,
And the Three Mysteries are gently brushed aside.
He frees the *Yuanshi* [元始] from its constraints,
And withdraws the *Muni* [牟尼]’s artifices.

He unfurls the *xiàngwàng* [象罔],
And tramples the *nièpán* [涅盘].

He severs the *Caoxi* [曹溪] lineage,
And leisurely resides in *Zhengpu* [郑圃].

Before *Dàmó* [达磨] and *Luóshì* [罗什] were born,
The *Nanhua* [南华] teachings already repelled *Qùkè* [御寇].

Alas, how scholars forget their roots and chase after branches,
Abandoning their own to favor outsiders.

They do not knock at the *Chōngxū* [冲虚] gate,
But cling to foreign *Dharma* [梵语].

Their homeland is secure,
Yet they seek validation in the West.

In vain, they wear out their straw sandals,
Searching for what, exactly?

The stone lion’s heart has been gouged out,
And the wild fox’s drool seeps into the marrow.

」

「When one seeks to practice *chan* and aspire to buddhahood,
Boasting in riddles like *ge teng* vines—
Who dares to deceive others?

Such a gentleman—how then does he guide others?

Now, I casually cast forth the *Dharma* elixir,
Hurling it into the mortal world,
Offering this *tiánhú* [醍醐], benefiting the noble ones.

I uplift the authentic Daoist life,
Revealing their true nature before them.

I disclose some clues,
Entrusting them to kindred spirits—
This family tradition, what melody does it sing?

Not bound by *lǜlǜ* [律吕], yet transcending mortal *yangchūn* [阳春],
A stringless *qin* [琴], yet blowing the *tiānlài* [天籁].

No need for jade threads and gold needles,
To embroider *nícháng* [霓裳] or phoenixes.

Those who grasp this truth—
Returning home, they ascend the eternal gathering,
Where the moonlit towers never sleep.

A bottomless basket draws water,
A rootless iron tree blooms.

This grand design—
How shall it be sealed with official insignia?

At the borders of *Húnlún* [浑沦], no negotiation allowed.
Before the *Língbǎo* [灵宝] peak—who dares set foot?

Only be unrestrained, not entangled in confusion.
Instantly awakening to the Dao’s wind,
Roaming the cosmos in ease,
Long awaiting the celestial ranks—
I humbly implore, hold this in reverence.

**The Third [Section]**
*Qín Zhēnrén* [秦真人]

A hundred years of life—
Swift as flowing water,
A lifetime’s deeds—
Empty as floating bubbles.

Yesterday, peach and apricot blossoms on your face,
Today, frost and snow break through your hair.

*Sū Xīnggōng* [苏相国], though bearing six seals of office,
Could not escape the *wúcháng* [无常];
*Guō Zǐyú* [郭子仪], though rising to the *sāngōng* [三公],
Still met the *dàxiàn* [大限].

The white ants’ battlefield crumbles like a dream,
The *zǐguī* [子规]’s cry urges you to return.

Do not wait for calamity to strike—
Only then will you know it was all illusion.

Gold and jade fill the halls—
How can you guard them,
When your children stand before you,
And you sigh in vain?

Red towers, emerald pavilions, high white walls—
None concern you;
White horses, red wheels, golden bells—
All belong to others.

In vain you bind your wounds—
Unnoticed, time’s finger ticks away.

The *guǐshǐ* [鬼使者] do not bend to favors,
*Yán Lǎozi* [阎老子] cares not for human sentiment.

A thousand tears fall—
What use is regret now?

The intestines split into nine—
Who else is there to blame?

At this juncture, rest or not—
Only then do you know the myriad errors.

Melancholy as falling flowers and flowing water,
Powerless to bear;
Desolate as withered grass and autumn winds,
Unbearable to recall.

Yet the wise and resolute—
Plunging into all things, awakening in an instant.

Gold is dung, jade is dust—
To buy the Dao;
Heaven and Earth are turned—
By the hands of the sage.

No more calculating gains and losses,
Measuring dawn and dusk.

Backbone like steel, heels like iron.
Why bother refining elixirs or alchemy,
To return to the *Sāndǎo* [三岛]?
No need for furnaces or cauldrons—
Directly ascend to the *Shízōu* [十洲].

*Xǔ Jīngyáng* [旌阳] lifted his home to the heavens—
Thus it was.
The *Huáinán Wáng* [淮南王]’s entire family escaped—
No other way.

Better to be a high one,
Creating cosmic upheavals,
With ancient-leaping, modern-soaring prowess.

Heart and mouth in harmony,
Mouth and heart as one.
Your name is inscribed at the *Dāntái* [丹台],
Your merit destined for the *Zǐfǔ* [紫府].

If this is mere saintly fabrication,
How pitiful to deceive the virtuous!

I am ashamed of my clumsy words,
Dare not speak further.

Long standing among the celestial guests,
I humbly implore, hold this in reverence.

---
**Tea Ode**

I have heard—
A single thunderclap shakes loose
The fragrant essence of all grades.

Phoenix cakes, dragon clusters—
Manifesting the *zhìzhēn* [至真]’s rare wonder.

Nourished by *yīnyáng* [阴阳], flourishing,
Heaven and Earth in misty fusion.
Drawing the *zhèngqì* [正气] of the four seasons,
Surpassing the *qīngwèi* [清味] of the five phases.

Before spring’s garden, it grows as precious jade,
Before the snow-laden peak, *Zàohuà* [造化] crafts the sacred bud.

The immortal hands pluck it—
Timely use revealed.
Ground in the golden mortar, its aroma assaults the nose;
Boiled in the stone kettle, its blossoms dance in waves.

*Lú Quán*’s seven bowls—
Washing away the six desires’ delusion;
*Zhào Lǎo*’s three cups—
Cleansing all beings from their dreams.

Those who love it find their spirits refreshed,
Those who awaken find their hearts serene.

Do not say this is the *shìzi* [释子]’s tradition—
Truly, the Daoists benefit from it.

Casually sharing this one essence,
I bestow it upon all—
Returning with joy, I humbly implore, hold this in reverence.

---
**Seven True Ones’ Chan Praises and Preface**

*Pīyún Zhēnrén* [披云真人]

The *Quánzhēn* [全真] Dao—
Its origins stretch far back.
Though *Zēng Zǐgǔ* [曾子固] spoke of it in detail,
Later scholars still deemed it obscure.

For *quán* [全] means all things are whole,
And *zhēn* [真] means every thought is true.
All things whole—
Nothing is lacking, nothing incomplete.
Every thought true—
No moment untrue.

Yet to say all things are whole is not yet *quán* [全],
To say every thought is true is not yet *zhēn* [真].
For the *quán* in *quán* is not *quán*,
And the *zhēn* in *zhēn* is not *zhēn*—
Yet nothing is un-*quán*, nothing un-*zhēn*.

When one reaches this stage,
*Quán* and *zhēn* become a single thread—
Yet ten thousandfold, they remain unattained.

Thus they can traverse mountains and rivers,
Move cities, tread fire and water,
Enter metal and stone,
Roam freely, transform endlessly.

This teaching originates from *Tàishàng* [太上],
Transmitted to *Dōnghuá* [东华].
*Dōnghuá* passed it to *Zhèngyáng* [正阳],
*Zhèngyáng* to *Chúnyáng* [纯阳],
*Chúnyáng* to *Chóngyáng* [重阳].

Before *Chóngyáng*, the Dao’s seed was just sprouting,
Few believed in it.
After *Chóngyáng*, its influence spread—
Seven generations have flourished since.

His disciple, *Dōnglái Pīyúnzǐ* [东莱披云子],
After strict fasting and purification,
Composed these *Seven True Ones’* praises.

The verses read:

The teaching’s ancestor, *Zhòngé* [重鹅],
Boldly shed his golden seals.
He bore *Dòngbīn*’s [洞宾] secret precepts,
Drank the *Gānhé*’s [甘河] sacred draught.

Ascending the highest steps,
Entering the *Xuánxuán Táng* [玄玄堂].
He gathered the four friends from the Eastern Sea,
Led the assembly of immortals in the Upper Realm.

The golden lotus bloomed for ten thousand ancestors,
The jade leaves passed on nineteen generations’ grace.
Since the master departed,
The *Zhōngnán* [终南] still holds its fine winds.

---

**The Second**
Leaning on *Dānyáng*’s peak, his triple braids swayed in dance.
Secretly seizing the *Cìyù*’s hidden thread,
Awakening to the *Fēnlí*’s parting words.
He cast aside half a realm’s old possessions,
Answering the *Sānqīng*’s celestial selection.

Before the *èrqì* had yet divided,
He moved where the *wǔxíng*’s reach did not extend.
A thunderclap—he turned and returned,
Laughing, clapping hands as petals rained.

**The Third**
Bowing to the *Chángzhēn*’s lofty truth,
Unbound by petty conventions.
His courage chilled autumn’s breath,
His stance firm as iron.

He cast off worldly ties with bold resolve,
Entered the Dao’s gate with unyielding will.
He inherited *Lǎngránzǐ*’s nine-fold transformation,
Received *Chóngyáng*’s four-word precept.

Transcending *yīnyáng*’s refining,
Unlocking *Zàohuà*’s binding knots.
For ten years, he savored *Luòyáng*’s spring—
Yet casually dismissed the east wind’s tale.

**The Fourth**
Magnificent, the *Chángshēng*’s bearing stood apart,
His elegance unmatched.
Disgusted by dust’s cloying stench,
Awakened to the *Zōngfēng*’s subtle currents.

His heart roamed beyond the world’s mists and clouds,
His traces mingled with the market’s drums and pipes.
His flower-pin adorned *Làngyuàn*’s crimson,
His peach-cheeks tasted *Pénghú*’s jade-green.

Soaring above the surging waves ten thousand feet high,
A spark of numinous light—yet none could see.

**The Fifth**
Truly great, the *Chángchūn*’s virtue shone early,
His youthful purity unmatched.
Alone, he crossed the *Hángǔ*’s winds,
Seven years seated by *Pánxī*’s moon.

Six times summoned by imperial decree,
Four audiences at the imperial court.
His teachings transformed tens of kingdoms in *Xūjìng*,
He did not shrink from wind and snow across thirty thousand *lǐ*.

On *Bǎoxuán* Terrace, he dreamed of immortals—
Dew dripped from pine needles, revealing his return.

**The Sixth**
Called *Cìtǐ Xuán*, he held true essence naturally.
His given name split from the □-bamboo,
His station fixed by the golden lotus.
In June, he stood welcoming the sun,
In winter, he embraced snow in tranquil rest.

Though the rooster was cooked, he sang again,
Though the poison was drunk, his life extended.
He received the *Jīnguó*’s four edicts,
Bowed to the *Yùhuáng*’s two proclamations.

Ask the moon beneath *Tiězhí* Mountain—
Would it share its secrets with mortals?

**The Seventh**
In the *Tàigǔ*’s prime, fortunate to meet *Chóngyáng*,
Rising beyond mists and clouds,
Far beyond fame and gain’s arena.
At *Nínghǎi*’s market, he turned back sun and moon,
Beneath *Zhào Zhōu*’s bridge, he sat unyielding through frost.

Refining the *wǔxíng* into marrow,
Boiling the *Bāguà* for sustenance.
Eighty-four years—his debt repaid,
East wind turned, gazing back at his homeland.

Someone asked: *"Has the Dao of the Seven True Ones ended here?"*
He replied: *"Not yet."*

**The Eighth**
Is this like chasing the fading traces of a swift steed,
Or gathering the fallen feathers of a phoenix,
And claiming them as the whole of horse and phoenix?
Is that possible?

Some may laugh and bow in reverence.
Only the sage knows the sage,
Only the true knows the true,
Only the phoenix knows the phoenix,
Only the *lín* knows the *lín*.

Only the aged Daoist of the Cloud-Cloak,
With his wondrous years entering the Way,
Has served the Eternal Spring for over forty seasons of frost.

He has received the most refined essence of the Seven True Ones.
In his revealed divine treasury of the Dao,
I have heard and seen its depths.

His words flow as praise,
Each utterance divinely resonant,
No idle speech, no empty rhetoric.
If scholars of the world read this,
They will find it a trustworthy foundation without doubt.

**The "Adrift and Free" Ode**
In harmony’s ease, drifting free and unbound,
Preserving life while avoiding worldly clamor.
Familiar with seagulls, swimming in boundless shallows,
Strumming the *sè* while gathering fishermen and woodcutters.

Aiding the *kuī* without shame,
Honoring glory yet unconcerned with high status.
Withdrawing to late fishing, trusting steps with spring’s play.

His robes complete, his silk refined,
His virtue overflows like dew on the *liáo xiāo*.
The *Huángtíng* dispels all cares,
The *Zǐyù* awaits the final dawn.

There, he opens the three paths,
Riding the *fúxiáo* to sport in the nine heavens.
His emotions flow across a short flute,
His firm grasp returns to youthful vigor.

No favor sought, no reliance on rank,
Contentment and leisure suffice for wealth.
He fulfills others’ tasks with borrowed ink,
Yet alone appreciates the *shān láo*’s worth.

Thus, he bathes in the waters of *Yí*,
Rejecting the noise of *Xǔ*’s jug.
With empty heart, he accepts the *zhuó zhuó*’s chisel,
Mingling with the coarse yet unyielding.

When times are adverse, he knows to halt,
In winter’s chill, his resolve never fades.
With nine thoughts at the *jié yī*’s bow,
Five willows left to their wild state.

His partner may till the fields,
He rests, too lazy to bend his waist.
Irrigating the ridges, he gladly embraces the jar,
Forgetting taste, delighting in the *sháo*’s song.

Removing harm weighs less than gold and jade,
He devotes himself to brightening ancestral halls.
His lofty strides outpace the swiftest steed,
With wings raised, he laughs at the sparrow’s flight.

Cutting off learning, he wanders the *xián pǔ*’s mystery,
Singing praises to the sacred age.
Watching the *yú* at the curved pond,
Covering the deer with withered bananas.

Blocking the *duì* is futile in truth,
Deep roots need not be pulled like seedlings.
Unraveling disputes requires steady discourse,
Nurturing simplicity finds joy in boundless ease.

Hiding in seams of profound subtlety,
Like the foolish, he conceals his radiant virtue.
Entering Zen, he kneels at the *jú lóu*,
Scratching tiles with skillful *líng cháo* waves.

Equalizing all things—what true gain?
Sealing the *róng*—can the world be transcended?
Ah, the race of snails in vain,
While crows ascend the lofty trees.

But look at the plowman in common toil,
How could he bow to lesser ranks?

The phoenix’s *shēng* sounds beyond the clouds,
Spring’s hues are teased with a staff’s tip.

Who sets free the carved *yuān*?
The unstrung *qín* self-tunes.
Returning to emptiness at day’s end,
No need for imperial carriages.

**The Hall’s Precepts**
**The White Jade Rabbit**
Heaven, Earth, gods, spirits, and the Five Daoists,
All follow rules to define square and round.
Go against, and paths lead to chaos and confusion,
Follow, and all aligns with nature’s flow.

The Dao has existed since antiquity,
This Hall’s rise is recent.
A nurturing chamber for the Daoists’ refined essence,
A place where the sages’ burdens are cast aside.

Morning and evening, incense burns,
Praying for the longevity of the Celestial Kings and Saints.
Dawn and dusk, scriptures are expounded,
Guarding the *tánnà*’s families in peace and fortune.

Thus, hidden and revealed are beyond measure,
The common and the sage dwell together.
With only a hat and a meal in a gourd,
Living as a *húzhōng*’s humble craftsman;
Alone as a wild cloud or heron,
A man of leisure beyond worldly ties.

Free and unconstrained, drifting effortlessly,
Awakening from the *huángliáng* dream in a single pillow of clear wind;
The *jīn gōng* furnace opened, half the window bathed in silent moonlight.

When deeds are fulfilled and the Way complete,
His body’s subtlety merges with spirit’s essence.
Lying low as dragon and tiger,
He emerges from the muddled streets,
Riding *luán* and *hè* to return to the cavernous halls.

Some may first escape worldly snares,
Suddenly enter the mysterious gates,
Yet their innate nature remains unclear,
Their heart’s foundation still in doubt.

They must diligently follow the guiding principles,
Long practice will not stray from the model.

Serving teachers, respecting friends,
Remembering the Dao, pondering the true.
Always focus on life and nature’s core,
Never let ambition for fame or gain take hold.

Walk with measured steps,
Speak without clamor.
Do not sing of youthful allure,
Nor discuss matters of right and wrong.
For public or private errands,
Lights must not be seen before returning;
Silent meditation, speechless,
Rise only when the bell tolls.

Arriving, clearly state your belongings,
Departing, hand in your items to the assembly.
Any transgression will be met with punishment.
Minor offenses: incense, oil, tea, and cakes,
Severe crimes: exile to the bamboo groves below the mountain.

Theft of even a single coin,
Destruction of robes or alms bowls,
Drinking or gambling—
These are forbidden in the Hall.

Failure in duties shall be doubly penalized.
Thus, these precepts are proclaimed,
Let all know them well.

**Ode of Praise**

The Five Lakes’ clouds and waters,
Mingle within one hall.

Since gathered are the disciples,
Must be made clear the precepts’ framework.
Some are ordinary, some sages—
At times concealed, at times revealed.
Divine transformations are boundless,
The Dao’s rules are ever constant.
In quietude, one may tread—
Yet trust in life’s fate or Heaven’s decree.
No man shall drag you down,
No matter shall arise by chance alone.

Heaven gave birth to me,
Heaven shall take me back.
To heed Heaven’s will—
What could be more fitting?
Times must be discerned,
Things wax or wane.
Man flourishes or declines,
Affairs rise or fall.
Dragons do not leap in winter,
Fireflies soar when night descends.
Noble and ignoble alike—
Each has its season.

Master Kong pondered twice,
Zengzi reflected thrice.
Who am I, then?
Dare I not refine myself?

Words are bonds of trust,
Sun and moon are bright.
Ceasing war is strength,
Lamb’s fat makes fine broth.
Men are wise or foolish,
Matters great or small.
Gain comes not by hardship,
Loss is ever swift and easy.
Doubt not when resolved,
Delay not when decided.
To hesitate when cutting—
Only brings disorder in return.

When others are good, do not seek to follow,
When faults are your own, do not let them linger.
This is called knowing the Dao—
Is it not difficult indeed?

Precious as gold and jade,
Heavy as hills and mountains.
Grace like the phoenix and crane,
Fragrance like orchids and osmanthus.
Spring comes but once,
Flowers bloom but once.
Youth fades never to return,
Time passes never to come again.

The lingering notes of the crane—
Roll them into the ninth stanza.
