**Song of the Returned Elixir and Golden Liquor, with Preface**

The Dao gathers in emptiness, fundamentally without duality. Yet in cultivation, there are distinctions between internal elixir (neidan) and external elixir (waidan), arising from differing encounters and slight variations in function, though the attainment of the Dao remains one.

What is called "internal" refers to the inherent completeness of the Dharma-body of self-nature, not reliant on externals, the natural truth. The work of advancement lies in gathering emotions into nature and returning nature to the origin. The doing of doing arises from non-doing; the realization of non-realization is true realization. When the embryo is perfected and spirit transforms, the body is shed, and one ascends to transcendence.

The oral instruction states:
*A single numinous nature is called the Golden Elixir,
The four illusions serve as the furnace to refine it into a pill.*
This is the True One, the Mysterious One—also named the internal elixir.

What is called "external" pertains to the illusory, impermanent body, inevitably subject to decay, which must rely on external medicine to be transmuted into truth. The work of ingestion and refinement involves capturing the essence of sun and moon, seizing the creative power of Heaven and Earth. When the medicinal spoon enters the mouth, passions and desires instantly dissolve; bones and flesh wholly fuse. Form and spirit become wondrous, and one ascends in broad daylight to join the Jade Clarity.

The oral instruction states:
*The Wood Fluid originally issues from cinnabar,
Refining the Wood Fluid returns it to the elixir’s body.*
The elixir reverts to gold, and gold is liquified—this is the Returned Elixir, the Golden Liquor, also named the external elixir.

Whether termed internal or external, each further contains internal and external aspects. Gathering emotions into nature originates externally; returning nature to the origin originates internally. When nature is quiescent and emotions are empty, there is neither movement nor stillness, and no longer any internal or external—this is the internal and external of the internal elixir.

Internally, the Wood Fluid is preserved as the ancestor; externally, true lead is borrowed to restrain it. Once the internal medicine is subdued, the external medicine is discarded, and there is likewise no internal or external—this is the internal and external of the external elixir.

Yet the internal landscape is subtle and wondrous, formless and nameless. The sagely teacher, out of necessity, borrows the names and images of the external elixir to illustrate its principles, making them easier to comprehend, hence also calling it the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir. Who would have known that later learners would cling to names and images, only to generate doubt? Some, upon hearing of the internal and external divisions in elixir arts, assume multiplicity and confusion, uncertain of what is correct.

This Dao is like a great city. Those who approach from the four directions, taking winding side paths, endure long journeys and may even lose their way. But if one takes the main road, whether entering from the east, south, west, or north gate, upon reaching the city, all are one. What then remains of the four directional paths?

In Buddhism, some enter through recitation of the Buddha’s name, others through Chan meditation. After exhausting the eighteen hundred koans, upon awakening, both recitation and meditation vanish. In Daoism, some advance through internal elixir cultivation, others through external elixir refinement. After traversing the three thousand six hundred dharma gates, upon realizing the Dao, both cultivation and refinement dissolve. Koans and dharma gates are no longer needed—like forgetting the trap once the fish is caught, or the snare once the rabbit is trapped. How can one then argue over right and wrong?

In ancient times, the Heavenly Worthy expounded eighteen thousand scriptures; the World-Honored One preached over five thousand sutras—perhaps too abundant. Later, when Donghua revealed the Complete Perfection teachings, or Bodhidharma came from the West without establishing texts, it may have seemed too sparse. Yet in awakening, every phenomenon is the Dao—neither sparse nor abundant. In delusion, every path is dark, and the more one seeks, the further one strays. How can one judge based on abundance or sparsity?

Some, lacking proper learning, misinterpret elixir scriptures, citing the *Book of Changes*: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao," and "The way of Qian becomes male; the way of Kun becomes female." They take human male and female as symbols of Heaven and Earth, using them as the crucible and furnace, extracting yin and yang as medicinal substances. They do not realize that the Great Dao fundamentally has no male or female imagery. When immortals employ symbols as metaphors, they refer to the principle of primordial interdependence, not the forms of the posterior heaven.

The oral instruction states:
*What is visible cannot be used;
What can be used is not visible.*
This is the essence of the internal elixir’s medicinal substances.

A poem by an earlier master says:
*One thing originally has one truth,
One body also contains a Heaven and Earth.
Know that the myriad things are complete within me—
How could the Three Powers establish separate roots?*

Immortal masters also say:
*Within one’s own body, there is husband and wife,*
*One man and one woman raise six children.*
All refer to the creative power inherent within the body, not derived from without.

Let us cite one or two examples of those who attained the Dao through internal elixir. Lord You Sheng, at seven years old, entered Mount Taihe to cultivate and ascend. Master Xu Jing also at seven entered the Upper Clarity Palace to cultivate and achieve liberation from the corpse. From where did they obtain their medicinal substances? Clearly, they were self-sufficient, not seeking from others.

Those who cling to perverse views are far from the Dao. Texts like the *Yellow Register* and *Red Writings* were originally composed for householders to practice restraint and nurture life, yet later generations misused them to indulge desires and harm life—how can one not be warned?

As for the great medicine of the external elixir, it is also not obtained from another’s body. Though the five metals and eight minerals of the world are posterior heaven’s substantial things, they are not used. The medicine is fundamentally non-existent, extracted as qi and fluid from the insubstantial within the substantial—this is the arising of something from nothing.

The oral instruction states:
*What has form cannot be a companion;
What generates form from formlessness is called the Returned Elixir.*

The common crowd, ignorant of this, may regard it as alchemical trickery, slandering the true Dao. Such people hasten their own guilt and will fall into the uninterrupted hell.

Some may claim the mind is the Dao itself, yet the Dao is formless and imageless, while the external elixir generates form from formlessness—how could they intersect? Moreover, clinging to artificial effort risks falling into emptiness.

Let us consider the analogy of medicine. When one is struck by wind-evil or bitten by a rabid dog, the injury lies in the physical *qi*, yet the symptoms may induce heart pain, mental confusion, delirium, or loss of consciousness. Conversely, when one is afflicted by shock, sorrow, or excessive thought, leading to palpitations or madness, the injury and symptoms both reside in the heart. Yet by administering external medicine to regulate the physical *qi*, the heart and spirit may be calmed—how could this occur without mutual influence?

Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, the Three were enfolded in One. At the first movement, Yin and Yang separated, and the myriad things took form, each possessing its own Supreme Ultimate. Principle and *qi* depend on one another, rooted in the Dao; existence and non-existence restrain each other—this is the reason.

Though the refining of the external elixir involves artificial effort, once obtained and ingested, it requires no further action. No cultivation is needed: the physical form returns to primordial nothingness, the spirit attains great stillness, and one reverts to the undifferentiated state of the Supreme Ultimate, merging with the true Dao.

Originally, in receiving life, one is endowed with Yin and Yang, shaped by Heaven and Earth, confined within the two *qi* and five phases. Yet in realizing the Dao, one grasps Yin and Yang, wields Heaven and Earth, and transcends the two *qi* and five phases—form cannot decay, spirit cannot depart. Like smelting gold from ore, once refined, it cannot return to its original state. How then could one fall into emptiness?

Others may doubt whether the physical body can ascend and transform. To judge wondrous matters by common perception is indeed cause for skepticism. Yet dragons transform into tigers, and one may tread upon empty space; water chestnuts and turtles, red herbs and men, may divide their spirits, disperse their *qi*, and scatter their forms. An old maple becomes a feathered immortal; rotten wheat becomes a butterfly—these are transformations from the insentient to the sentient. A virtuous woman turns to stone; a mountain earthworm becomes a lily—these are transformations from the sentient to the insentient. Thus, earth, wood, metal, and stone all possess sentience, essence, and spirit, and like insects, beasts, grasses, and trees, they may undergo change without hindrance.

Humans alone are the most spiritually endowed of all things, their forms mirroring the Two Modes, their Dao encompassing the Three Ultimates—already half-immortal. The elixir seizes the ingenuity of creation, steals the harmony of Heaven and Earth. When humans ingest it, their impurities dissolve like melting ice and snow; the form transforms into *qi*, *qi* into spirit, spirit returns to emptiness, and one suddenly ascends to the sacred realm. Is this not the foundation of the supreme vehicle?

In ancient times, the Most High Lord Lao studied under the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, who first declared: *"Those who wish to become immortals yet do not ingest the Returned Elixir and Golden Liquid merely torment themselves in vain. Struck by cold, heat, wind, dampness, or demonic *qi*, even the Controller of Destiny cannot save them. Refine the divine elixir early to guard against harm. A moment’s labor yields eternal joy—once perfected, one becomes an immortal."*

From the Zhou, Qin, Han, Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties onward, all great immortals who realized the Dao and ascended to emptiness did so by this means. The sites of their transformations—cinnabar cliffs, elixir chambers, alchemical wells, sacred springs, crucibles, and mortar stones—remain visible to this day. Their writings, such as the *Great Clarity Scripture of the Elixir*, the *Embracing Simplicity Record of Fire*, and the *Songs of the Grass-Clad*, can still be examined.

To dismiss this as mere common sorcery is like a mayfly in vinegar, unaware of the vastness of Heaven and Earth. Alas, how the Dao has become obscured and unfulfilled! Some, lacking discernment, cling to stubborn emptiness or drift into reckless abandon; the ignorant, bound by prejudice, stray onto side paths.

Some, newly entered into the mysterious gate, fail to seek instruction and instead sit in rigid stillness. Others stand for long hours, practice *qi*-circulation, or engage in visualization, forcibly suppressing the mind until madness ensues. Some, ignorant and deluded, boast and contend; others master only empty rhetoric, flaunting their eloquence. A few, with half-baked insights, boast of their abilities and scorn the world; lacking true realization, they establish sects and demand veneration. Some steal sacred texts, assume false identities, and pose as masters, deceiving the blind and deaf.

Others obsess over fasting and abstinence, practice grain avoidance, adopt bizarre appearances, or wear strange attire. Though the world may revere them, they have no connection to the Dao. Ancient immortals managed property and wealth, yet suddenly ascended; some drank wine and ate meat, yet swiftly attained transcendence. Their minds dwelled beyond the material, blending with the world while cultivating in secret—beyond the comprehension of ordinary people. How can one judge them by outward appearances?

Alas, the Dao’s obscurity and failure to flourish have never been worse. Some, failing to examine the truth, remark: *"So-and-so fell ill from pursuing the Dao; so-and-so gained nothing from cultivation; so-and-so perished from ingesting elixirs."* They conclude the Dao is unlearnable and shameful to discuss. Yet they do not know that from ancient times to the present, those who attained truth and realized the Dao are beyond counting. To generalize from the misguided, the unsuccessful, and the ignorant is like choking and abandoning food altogether.

Those who know *that* it is so, yet do not know *why* it is so, must understand the four difficulties of seeking instruction and the ten challenges of advancing in the Dao.

What are they?
First, the paths are perilous: rivers and lakes are treacherous, the sea of humanity vast—whom can one ask as a teacher?
Second, cold and heat press upon the body, daily hardships oppress—before learning anything, unforeseen disasters may strike.
Third, the ignorant feign lofty attainment, while the wise remain silent and blend with the dust. Seekers, unable to discern true teachers, often pay homage to the wrong ones.

Fourth, even if one encounters a true teacher, if one’s aspirations and conduct are not yet worthy of trust, it is difficult to advance together. Or though one may advance, the teachings imparted may be incomplete. Should one, by good fortune, receive the full transmission, one’s years will have already advanced. Such are the difficulties of seeking instruction.

The ten challenges of advancing in the Dao are these:
First, to meet a true teacher early and have the correct Way revealed.
Second, to possess virtue and conduct that align with the heart of Heaven.
Third, to make a great vow to universally deliver living beings.
Fourth, to rely on the power of great merit to avoid demonic obstacles.
Fifth, to have the foundational capacity and encounter the right conditions.
Sixth, to form bonds with immortal companions whose aspirations and conduct are mutually trustworthy.
Seventh, to withdraw from worldly distractions and dwell in purity and stillness.
Eighth, to regulate diet and maintain regular daily rhythms.
Ninth, to guard one’s speech and act with diligence, avoiding slander and criticism.
Tenth, to reverently serve the divine immortals with unwavering sincerity.

These are the foundations of advancing in the Dao, and they are exceedingly difficult to fulfill. Should even one of these ten be lacking, it is hard to achieve complete success. As Tao Hongjing’s *Dengzhen Yinjue* meticulously sets forth the precepts and prohibitions of cultivation, and works like the *Tiantai Zhiguan* and *Guifeng Xiuzheng Yi* clearly explain demonic obstacles and prepare for the unforeseen, so too must the practitioner be vigilant. Yet today, many are deficient in seeking instruction but hasty in seeking results, often failing to recognize their own limitations.

Nevertheless, there are those who fully dedicate themselves to the Way yet still cannot escape misfortune. For instance, Śākyamuni Buddha endured the severing of his limbs; the ancient Buddha Dingguang was exiled to Nan’an; Yan Hui died young; Zilu was made into mincemeat; Gongye was imprisoned; Boniu suffered illness; Zhang Guo was struck by King Zhou; Guo Pu was executed by Dun; Master Ziyang endured three banishments; and Qing’an met his end over tea. Though none of these calamities could sway their resolve, and life and death were not theirs to control, it remains true that flesh and bone are bound by karmic destiny. As the scriptures say: *"One who walks on land does not avoid rhinoceroses and tigers; one who enters battle does not shun armor and weapons."* Such is the way of those who have attained the Dao—how could it be easily achieved by mere students?

I have heard that the Perfected One Bai Ziqing of Purple Clarity wandered for nine years, enduring countless hardships, before finally encountering a true teacher. Another twenty years passed before he found refuge in the household of Prime Minister Jin of Hongdu, where he practiced in seclusion for a decade before achieving immortality and ascending. If even the sages, buddhas, and worthies of antiquity faced such varied demonic trials, how much more so must students? Yet one must not falter in difficulty or waver in resolve.

For those who pursue the Dao and seek to become immortals or buddhas, it is much like the Confucian scholar’s aspiration to become a sage. One must simply steadfastly commit to the path and practice diligently. As for success, that is a matter of Heaven—how can one insist upon it? Yet once this wondrous Dao enters the ear, it becomes an eternal seed of sagehood. Thus, the Perfected One Guan Yin said: *"To hear the Dao in the morning is to be ready to die by evening."* Though the student may not yet attain the ultimate fruition of embodying the Dao, compared to those mired in worldly learning or those who have never heard the Way at all, the difference is as vast as heaven and earth.

Having received the esteemed teachings of Master Fanghu and the handwritten instructions of the Perfected One, which expound the secret language of the Great Return—referring to the teachings of the external elixir—I recall that Master Yi of Zhenyi once studied under the Daoist Li of Taiqing and received these teachings thirty years ago, yet rarely spoke of them. Now, having the opportunity to read them again, I am reminded of Ge Zichuan’s words: *"Since receiving Master Zheng’s scriptures on the Golden Elixir of the Returned Cinnabar, twenty years have passed. My family has not even a peck of grain in store, and in my poverty, I lack the means to purchase the ingredients. Though I know the method, it is no different from ignorance."* Such words are truly sigh-worthy.

Moved by these reflections, I write this preface to record my sense of warning and to dispel doubts for those who hold faith. In response, I compose the *"Song of the Golden Elixir of the Returned Cinnabar"* to return to the messenger:

Within the Palace of Square Pot, an aged immortal elder,
Seated on a thin mat, the room suffused with white light.
The great thousandfold world contained within a hair’s tip,
Mysteriously aligned with the One, abiding in profound silence.

Once in Nanchang, I met a perfected one,
Who revealed the elixir’s secrets, unlocking the true.
Rolling and unfolding creation, returning to the primordial vastness,
Matching yin and yang in a fleeting moment.

The crucible is not a crucible, the furnace not a furnace—
Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing share the same pattern.
Fire is the medicine, the medicine is fire—
Sun and moon’s rising and setting know no self or other.

The azure-clad maid and the white-robed youth,
In the bridal chamber, their union consummates the appointed time.
From nothing, something arises—this is the elixir’s ancestor,
The true lead, the mother of Heaven and Earth.

Refining mercury into cinnabar, then discarding the lead,
Like a child grown, the mother returns to dust.
The elixir complete, it transforms into gold—the golden liquid,
Taken into the mouth, one ascends to the celestial steps in broad daylight.

Why, with white hair, do you still linger in the dusty world?
The great medicine lacks resources, the place of practice hard to choose.
When the time comes, enter the chamber and regulate the fire talisman,
The work complete, ride the crane to follow Master Fanghu.

**Verse in Return to the True Dao**
In response to the Feathered Guest of the Golden Gate, the Perfected One Zhi Xu, Zhen Bai Wei Yi, and the esteemed teachings of Master Fanghu.

The true of the supreme Dao begins with form and qi,
Establishing the Three Powers to nourish the ten thousand kinds.
Subtle, it returns to the traceless; vast, it knows no bounds.
Ahead, no beginning; behind, no end.

Pervading and embodying all things—who can fathom it?
The solitary peak stands bare, without obstruction.
It engages eyes, ears, nose, and tongue in ceaseless toil—
How could there be decay, emptiness, arising, or abiding?

With a casual gesture, the three bodies are revealed;
Idle words, though a thousand, contain not a single character.
Fu Xi’s wondrous alignment opened the primordial chaos,
Establishing the ultimate for the people, clarifying Heaven’s mandate.

Before the trigrams, the *Yi* was originally formless;
Beyond the circle, the Ultimate is not mere emptiness.
Looking up and down, the patterns are dense—
Kites soaring, fish leaping, all manifest the same brilliance.

Neither forgetting nor forcing, guard your solitude;
Be only precise, only one, hold to the center.
Unceasing sincerity finds its resting place—
Heaven and Earth unite in virtue to complete the supreme work.

The Perfected One, knowing destiny, values partaking of the mother;
Attaining emptiness, observing return—this is the elixir’s ancestor.
Taming and subduing like tigers and dragons,
Harmonizing concentration and wisdom like Wen and Wu.

Gathering emotions to return to nature, merging into the One Origin,
The One Origin forgotten, even forgetting is cast aside.

The three realms gathered into emptiness,
Emptiness shattered, transcending all peers.
Let kalpas dissolve like Ganges’ sands—
Unflickering spirit-light illumines past and present.

Monks have not fathomed virtue’s fullness,
Raising the koan: “Does a dog have Buddha-nature?”
Doubt knots tightly, seamless as a sphere,
Like one who dies utterly before reviving.

Suddenly grasping the intent from the West,
I trust that he and I are now the same.
The mud ox transforms into a lion’s roar,
No longer companion to the ten thousand dharmas.

In every circumstance, all is complete—
Who dares claim this is the mark of a true man?
Sages, immortals, Buddhas divide their gates,
Yet ultimately arrive home by the same path.

Beyond body and mind, no mystery remains—
Best to seek true inquiry and real awakening.
In boundless vastness, where to find a true teacher?
Who knows when the profound scriptures are misread?
Side paths and crooked trails lead many astray,
Clinging to emptiness or delusion breeds folly.

Doubt not yet dispelled, one mistakes awakening;
Old texts drilled endlessly become mere talk.
Sharp tongues display their wit,
Yet who recognizes the truth of the flower’s silent transmission?

Pitiful are the many wild-fox Chan,
Their words pure but conduct foul, deluded in true teaching.
The immortal’s bond lies in manifesting virtue;
Heaven’s Dao is impartial—it must favor the worthy.

Our ancestor, the wild old hermit of Pengtou,
Sought the hidden on Wuyi Peak.
At times he drew fresh currents from the sacred well,
Nurturing the profound Dao with enriching moisture.

The feathered guest of Golden Gate, Lord Fanghu,
Once sat in our ancestor’s spring breeze.
The ancestor said: “Seeing nature is distinct—
No need for transmission, wondrous awakening arises on its own.”

Lord Fanghu, though advanced in the Dao, still probed its depths.
One morning he asked me for the strategy to see nature.
A long whistle split heaven and earth with spring—
The golden crow flew forth as the eastern sky turned white.

---

**Mixed Learning**

Before the primal beginning, a thing already formed and complete,
Myriad forms spread forth, all emotions flourish.
Alone it comes, alone it goes, accomplishing transformations,
Neither increasing nor decreasing, following every shape.

Through endless kalpas it endures,
Encompassing the primordial transformations, latent in the void.
In my youth, I wore the scholar’s robe,
Burning oil through the night, diligently studying the *Yi*.
A three-foot sword’s radiance once lit the sky,
The two demons’ calamities swiftly vanished.

Weary of the turbid world’s six dusts in darkness,
I awoke from the dream of millet—all illusions stilled.
The immortal Shouchang, Iron-Xuan the Elder,
Once studied under Master Jin at the sacred well.
Returning to Qinghua, he opened a realm of peace,
Feeding me the Dharma-milk to revive my exhaustion.

Later, I followed Master Li,
And heard of Pu Yi and Feng the Recluse.
They too studied under Ancestor Jin, continuing the immortal lineage,
Abiding by Crane Dragon Sands to clarify the supreme principle.
Lightly shod, I went to question them—
“All dharmas return to the One, but where does the One return?”

At that time, the Recluse was in silent sitting;
Thunderous force shattered the empty sky.
He asked whence I came—
A pure wind pierced through, dispelling the clouds of delusion.
Vast and clear, I saw the moon in every home,
Illuminating the original—no words to speak.

---

**Inscription on the *High Wind in the Grove* Portrait**

The true and constant wondrous essence is originally formless;
Beyond form, one must bear the burden with strength.
Holding fast to sun and moon depends on mastery;
Opening and closing yin and yang, one freely gathers and releases.

The old immortal of Kongtong, with an icy, snowy demeanor,
Received the mind-to-mind transmission and could recall the past.
On a clear autumn night, the bright moon hung over the jade terrace,
With a staff of goosefoot and cloud-like robes, he wore a crane’s [plume].

My home is in Junyi, north of the Yuan River—
A single breath revives the spring light of ten thousand things.
Once I stirred wind and thunder to ward off demons,
Long keeping the star-like radiance of my sword sheathed.

Yesterday I visited old friends on Kongtong,
Hoping to halt the sun’s progress and gaze to the eight directions.
Gathering golden essence to refine the Wood’s fluid,
I sat in the Dipper’s sway, congealing the mysterious frost.

In this, the wondrous union blends like fish and water;
All else is not worth mentioning.
The Daoist Dongguo of the Mysterious Capital,
Vainly mimics appearances, laboring the painter’s craft.

Facing this, who says one sees by form?
One must seek the original face beyond all images.
Asking where my original self resides—
With a flick of my whisk, I laugh and ride the wind away.

---

**Inscription on the *Transmission* Portrait**

The supreme Dao is not transmitted by words,
Yet words aid wondrous awakening.
Thus the *Pass of the Celestial Ford* text
Points directly to the path of the true origin.

Zhong and Lü passed it down to later worthies,
Branching into northern and southern lineages for a thousand years.
The cosmos in hand, they stepped through the mysterious records,
Halting the sun and moon, opening golden lotuses.

I once followed their fragrant traces, sword at my waist,
Feasting on tiger’s marrow and dragon’s flesh in a jade pavilion.
The Three Flowers faintly suffused with flowing radiance,
The four seas vast, I trusted my solitary journey.

Yesterday, a lone crane rode the heavenly wind,
Roaming Mount Song and Hua, surpassing Kongtong.
The flute’s notes cut through the green of mountains and waters—
Who shares my lofty aspirations beyond the world?

The peach-planting Daoist, profound and serene,
Conduct pure, spirit clear, will noble and refined.
Gathering firewood, boiling stones, he served with diligence,
Standing in snow, forgetting the body, scorning illusions.

Receiving my *Register of Ascension and Transformation*,
At times he entered the sea to seek the dragon’s pearl.
Whipping thunder, riding qi, he ascended the purple pole,
Guiding the Dipper’s handle, he returned to the Great Void.

On the day of reunion in Kongtong after ten years,
He had already seen the portrait and recalled the past.
How much better to embody the body beyond the body—
The subtle, empty, and primordial leaves no trace.

---

**Exhortation to Advance in the Dao**

Leaving home is to transcend the mundane,
Cutting off worldly ties to avoid entanglement.
Carrying a bowl and gourd, journeying far to find a bright teacher,
Serving with labor, striving for loyal admonition.

Accumulate essence, nourish qi, preserve primal harmony,
Refine nature, subdue the mind, brighten wisdom’s torch.
The inner work’s subtlety values hidden cultivation;
Outward conduct’s diligence must be fully prepared.

Depart form, abandon craft, dismiss cleverness,
Conceal your light, blend with the world, guard solitude.
Gather the deviant to return to the correct, praising the divine,
Aid beings, benefit life, widely cultivate blessed affinity.

Put others first, cast aside pride and arrogance,
Endure anger, swallow shame, forget favor and disgrace.
Coarse clothes, plain food, forsake glory,
Overcome hardships, dissolve transgressions, erase the ghostly ledger.

When blessed affinity and wisdom’s power are both complete,
Your name is inscribed on the cinnabar terrace, ranked among immortals.
Riding the void, roaming the spirit, gazing into the boundless,
Looking down, the vast seas seem like a snail’s trail.

For kalpas, all kin receive blessings—
How could it be only for one’s lord, teacher, or parents?
Even if past karma generates demonic obstacles,
When retribution ends, the Dao-fruit will still ripen.

Why do those in this degenerate age, wearing the starry cap,
Fail to awaken and leave their families to seek the profound?
Willingly drowning in the river of love and sea of desire,
Bound by the shackles of profit and the fetters of fame.

Having dimmed our original face within,
We scheme for external things to pass to other clans.
When the body perishes and all is cast aside,
Karmic destinies follow—who then shows compassion?

Now I reveal this truth to all fellow learners:
Wealth and poverty, noble and base—each has its measure.
Who claims cunning schemes bring wealth alone?
How many schemers lack even clothes to wear.
Is there no fool whose halls hang empty?
Yet fools too may have fields near the city walls.
All stems from causes planted in past lives,
Our lot in this one fixed as if by contract.
Flourishing and decline are ordained by creation—
Why toil so tirelessly in grasping greed?

Even householders should study the Chan of forgetting home,
Turn toward goodness, turn from dust, and seek awakening.
How much more those who dwell beyond the world,
Who ought to seek true joy beyond the mundane.
Turn back swiftly—do not waste time,
For the teachings of immortals and Buddhas are never wrong.

Have you not seen Dan Yang, who taxed half a province,
Then cast it off like worn-out shoes, never to reclaim?
A deerskin robe, alms-rice from a hundred homes,
Husband and wife parted for a thousand miles.

Have you not seen Master Pang, wealthy yet debt-free,
Gold left forever in the sands of Deer Gate Shoal?
Joyful gatherings, speaking of the unborn,
Daughter selling fish-traps, son tending oxen.
The two elders’ noble ways cut free from profit and desire,
Honoring the Dao, prizing virtue, scorning worldly currents.
Do not say such lofty ones are beyond comparison—
Each person has the share to seek it.

Following their example, one naturally looks to the mysterious bond,
Why bind the waist and rush to Yangzhou?
The prophecy of Hua Lin has stood for a thousand years,
The eight-hundred-year cycle now matches its measure.

Recalling when Master Li bestowed the Way of Primordial Unity:
At Prince Teng’s lofty pavilion, mid-autumn,
I bowed again to the immortal mat to receive the Great Return.
At midnight, wind and thunder crossed the sea,
Clouds and rain arrived together at the Mysterious Pass.
Spring’s light entered the earth, golden sprouts grew,
The Dipper’s handle circled the heavens, the jade clepsydra ran dry.
The moon filled the great void, still he rode the crane,
Soaring lightly up to Jade Capital Mountain.

The Dao-Sword
Pure Yang personally transmitted the Dao-Sword’s method—
No need for Ou Ye to forge unyielding steel.
Born with the body, endowed with life, it moves with subtle skill,
Taking form at will, its killing qi surges forth.
Sharpened in the ravine, lightning flashes,
Hewing the cassia in the moon, it gathers celestial fragrance.
Sometimes hung beneath South Mountain,
It frightens yin-demons into distant hiding.

In Reply to Master Li
I had hoped to go to Purple Mystery Abbey at Dragon Gate to refine the divine elixir,
But before I arrived, you came—sending this instead.
You are the same venerable one of old,
Though Dragon Gate’s old hermitage has stood a thousand years.
The Dao merges with the Emperor of Images at the nameless beginning,
Learning delves into Fu Xi’s time before the first diagrams.
Golden qi responds to the season, still advancing the fire,
Mercury’s essence congeals, gradually drawing forth lead.
With a single spoonful from the divine crucible, it can divide me,
Then I shall follow the soaring simurgh to meet the highest immortals.

Tang Immortal Luo Gongyuan
Entering and leaving the imperial chambers at will,
Playing with divine powers.
At the time, Emperor Ming Huang grew jealous,
Summoned him to the palace hall, had soldiers lie in ambush and shoot him dead,
Ordered his burial.
The coffin was very light; when opened, he was gone—
Only two sandals remained.

One day, a tribute of oranges arrived. When Emperor Ming Huang cut one open, each segment split into two. He questioned the envoy about this, who replied: "On the road, I encountered a one-eyed Daoist who asked for an orange but was refused. He merely borrowed it to smell before leaving, and instructed me: 'When you see the Emperor, please bow and convey my regards to Wei Siyuan.'"
The Emperor laughed and said: "This was Luo Gongyuan."
His place of cultivation lay in Taihe County at Longmen’s Tai Xuan Abbey. Nearby stood Sanhua Mountain, where the summit served as his ascension site, and halfway up the mountain stood Zixuan Abbey, where he was venerated.

[Responding to Fu’s Letter]
Staying at Yunyin Mountain, one day I spoke of the three teachings as one family. At that moment, Fu, the Chronicler of Qingyuan Mountain, raised doubts. A month later, we met again, and when I revisited the same topic, he suddenly gained insight. The next day, he arrived in formal robes, bearing incense, to pay respects at the mountain and express gratitude. He then presented eight verses, hinting at his intent to remain in the mountains. I responded in kind:

Abandoning evil, still nurture the sprouts of lasting goodness,
The rootless tree bears empty blossoms.
Turning your head, you are already the Buddha of the Three Bodies—
Why seek face-to-face instruction over a hundred yards of tea?
Saints and mortals observe equally, without self or other,
Spirit’s clarity and silent illumination pervade the Ganges’ sands.
Spring brings beauty everywhere—
Why retreat to the mountains to escape the world’s splendor?

After parting, the Chronicler Fu sent another poem in the same rhyme, and I answered again:

Where in the primordial chaos can one seek the root or sprout?
All is perfectly clear through the Lotus Sutra’s turning.
When shall we share a cup of the Old Man of the East’s wine,
And I brew for you once more the tea of Master Zhao?
Sitting here, moments stretch into a thousand years,
Seeing through heaven and earth as but a grain of sand.
Alas, the multitudes never turn their heads—
In vain, fleeting life ages through its fleeting springs.

Three Verses in Response to Alchemist Zhibai’s Discourse on Daoist Teachings
Who recognizes the Great Dharma King of Qingwei?
He unfolds the Three Powers and the myriad things.
From the beginning, all dharmas arise from me—
Inverting or grasping them sideways poses no obstacle.

People know this Dao as mere emptiness,
Yet who awakens to true emptiness as not empty?
A single moon suffuses a thousand valleys’ waters,
Its pure light leaves no trace behind.

When the heart-field of the square inch is perfectly clear,
Responding and transforming everywhere, it remains without action.
The deluded see only a thousand-mile journey—
Yet how have the two feet ever moved half a step?

*Song in Response to Hu Zhiguan’s "Millstone"*
A single aperture at the crown admits a pearl,
Transforming the whole body into flying white snow.
Here, the iron heart knows no retreat—
Left or right, it moves as it wills.

Five Verses in Response to Magistrate Zheng of Baling’s Inscriptions at Yueyang’s Pure Yang Flying Chant Pavilion
Having traveled Yueyang, I recognize no one,
Crossing the vast lake alone, chanting in flight.
Turning back, the three emergences lie veiled in mist—
In an instant, the blue sea becomes mulberry groves.

The coquettish flower-maidens pity the infant,
Just as autumn’s midpoint arrives at midnight.
Inverting yin and yang, they conceive a numinous essence—
Across the boundless four seas, who can be their teacher?

Know the season for harvesting herbs, old or young,
With the knife and spoon, self-sufficiency is assured.
When all yin dissolves and the dry body is complete,
Conceive the child—trust there will be a son.

From the azure vault, a song gathers ten thousand immortals,
A five-zhang pearl hangs, expounding the profound mystery.
The Dao embraces the Supreme Ultimate, returning to the primordial mandate,
Its wondrous accord with the numinous terrace transcends words.

Who can share the mystery of mysteries?
With a laugh, we forget each other beyond the heavens.
Waving hands, I sing beneath the bright moon,
Dancing the embryo immortal’s triple ascent on the wind.

**Sixteen Admonitory Gāthās by Zhao Yizhen of Junyi, Compiled by Disciple Liu Yuanran of Zhang-Gan**

The immortals and sages ever pity the deluded scholar,
As a loving mother cherishes her infant child.
The heart of the Dao is like a child seeking its mother—
Why fear the immortals will not ferry him across?

The Yellow Emperor once studied under seventy masters,
Yet not all were perfected immortals.
Only upon meeting Guangcheng did he fathom the profound mechanism,
Then realized all prior teachings were not truly intimate.

Before the cyclical signs took form, there was no image;
Once the bodily frame appears, directions arise.
Our Dao forcibly names those beyond form—
One must forget appearances to fathom the eternal truth.

The Daoist takes the Dao itself as body,
The illusory, borrowed frame is not truly intimate.
Seeking me through form and sound is futile—
To speak of years and signs only deepens delusion.

When Luo He heard the Dao at ninety,
His teacher was but sixteen, a mere youth.
Learning the dance, he honored those who came before—
Thus he grasped the subtle workings of above and below.

Do not follow the perverse demons of heterodox paths,
Who parrot teachings to command their rabble.
Envious of the worthy, deceiving the common folk,
They vie for fame and profit, their self and others like mountains and rivers.

Do not imitate the deluded who lose the true transmission,
Failing to penetrate the profound mysteries yet slandering the sages.
For a time, they play the carefree guest in the world—
In heaven, there are no such muddled immortals.

Do not mimic the fox-like Chan of reckless emptiness,
Who dismiss karma and fortune to flaunt their wit.
They merely drum their tongues to startle the deaf and blind,
Heedless of their future plight in the bitter sea.

Do not follow false masters who mislead later worthies,
Absurdly dividing male and female into qian and kun.
Taking others’ essence and blood as the elixir’s origin—
How can swallows and sparrows give birth to hawks?

The heart’s heart—profound Dao—is hard to transmit;
Through borrowed images and written words, it enlightens later worthies.
Alas for the blind who lack true vision,
Who twist right teachings with perverse interpretations.

Exhausting gold to fill the earth,
Adding fire to quench a blaze, or springs to cool the cold.
Nothing harms life more than bedroom arts—
How many youths of the floating world have they slain?

The true mercury and lead of pre-heaven and pre-earth,
Formless and imageless, wondrously penetrate the profound.
If you grasp the true message within the formless,
Timely union will confirm you as an immortal above.

Embrace the origin, guard the One to establish the root—
Shattering the void is the moment of completion.
Later learners, scattered, lose the central Dao,
Bewildered by action, stagnant in non-action.

Barely grasping the mechanism yet lacking integration,
They insist on pursuing attainment at every moment.
Unattached when encountering things and circumstances—
Only then may you arrive home.

First to reach the shore of awakening, no boat is needed;
When wood rots and nails rust, what use is repair?
Most pitiful are those who later seek the ford,
Leaning on others’ oars and rudders, gazing at midstream.

Ancient sincerity does not lie in fame,
Chasing novelty to please the crowd wins fleeting praise.
Fortune and misfortune, life and death—all are transient lodgings;
Why trouble to establish a household?

**To Preceptor Yi and Scribe Qiao, Dear Friends of the Heart,**
After long separation, moved to compose:

The three teachings open the gate of the Dao’s meaning,
Heart to heart, with whom can this be discussed?
How is it that drifting dust obscures us,
Before we trust the heaven-encompassing mirror has dimmed?

**To an Old Friend**
Brewing tea at the crossroads to bind karmic ties,
When will the blessed fruit of humans and gods ripen?
Better to seize the spring wind early,
And take up the golden hoe to till your inch of field.

**Inscribed on the Immortal’s Chessboard**
Black and white arrayed, sitting in strategic thought—
Who knows how many springs and autumns pass in the world?
Yet no one grasps the crucial move within—
It lies solely in the immortal elder’s fingertip.

**Viewing the Luxuriant Tea Blossoms on the Trellis, While the Crabapple Alone Remains Unbloomed—**
**A Reflection Over Wine**

The trellis teems with seductive crimson, piled like brocade,
The reclusive crabapple, shy, refuses to open.
As evening comes, facing the wine, gazing upon it—
For your sake, I grieve the spring, never draining my cup.

**Two Gāthās in Response to Yuanyang Magistrate Wang’s Inquiry on the Essence of Nature and Destiny**

There is being, yet it is not being;
There is non-being, yet it is not non-being.
The autumn moon on the emerald pond,
Scattered stars, a solitary wheel.

The moon in water can be grasped,
The clouds at the sky’s edge can be bound.
Gather them into the gourd—
This is the elixir of eternal life.

**Self-Eulogy**

Essence of primordial yang,
Pillar of the Dao’s practice.
Unconcerned with ostentation,
Indifferent to praise or blame.
Standing alone in the vast,
Like floating clouds and flowing water.

**For the Disciples’ Tonsure and Robing**

I bestow upon you the starry crown,
For your head, the primal garb.
Ten thousand hairs enclose,
The two modes illumined.
Emerge with one head raised—
Majestic, uniquely revealed.

I bestow upon you the crimson robe,
As the adornment of your body.
Cloud-skirts refined, rosy pendants soaring—
Every limb is covered,
Dare not be unsolemn.

I bestow upon you the jade tablet,
To rectify your dignity.
Let your gaze be unswerving,
Reverent and self-possessed.
With concentrated heart, face the divine—
As if holding the great scepter.

I bestow upon you the yellow altar,
To govern your movements.
Circling the eight trigrams, pacing the nine palaces,
Standing like a crane at the court of the origin,
Bowing like a tiger, thus entrusted.

**Preface to the Daily Record**

In my youth, I sought the Dao from Master Li,
Who first bestowed upon me a daily record,
Instructing me to inscribe within it every intention, utterance,
Encounter, and response to affairs.
What could not be written should not be done;
Once done, regardless of success or failure, it must be recorded.
If it accords with principle, it aligns with the heart of heaven;
If it contravenes principle, it deceives the heart of heaven.
Should one act rashly without understanding the principle,
Unwittingly erring—this is a mistake, and the fault is forgivable.
But to knowingly act against principle and persist—
This is deliberate transgression, a grave sin.
Worse still, to fabricate falsehoods to conceal one’s faults,
And omit them from the record—this compounds the offense.

For my master’s intent was this:
The human heart is the heart of heaven;
To deceive the heart is to deceive heaven.
Thus he titled the record *The Heart of Heaven*,
And further admonished with this gāthā:

The heart of heaven is one with my heart;
If I deceive my heart, I obscure the workings of transformation.
When lifting the brush, I must reflect deeply—
The divine and the hidden do not tolerate deception.

Since receiving this teaching, I have upheld it without fail,
Restraining my conduct from the outset in all dealings.
Daily, I engage with the realm of the heart,
Seeking to grasp principle—though it seems impossibly difficult.
Over time, I gradually penetrated it,
Responding to things as they arose.
Though I have not fully aligned with the heart of heaven,
I have approached the realm of the noble,
Perhaps by one part in ten thousand,
And avoided the fate of the petty—this is great fortune indeed.

Here the fellow Daoists, steadfast in their resolve and set apart from the common crowd, have formed a karmic bond and found affinity, seeming ready to advance upon the Way. Yet in matters of principle, they have not yet attained thorough clarity, and may still be unwittingly burdened by habitual defilements. At times, they may fail to act when action is called for, or act when restraint is needed—such moments demand careful discernment. Thus, I transmit the teaching of the *Heart of Heaven* as received from my father and master, passing it on in turn.

Ah! A nine-tiered terrace begins with heaped earth; a thousand-mile journey starts with a single step. The gateway to the Dao and the foundation of virtue must likewise begin here—this is my hope for those of shared aspiration. The Dao is supreme; only through long and sincere accumulation of effort will one suddenly awaken, the heart fusing with principle, heaven and humanity united in virtue—then one truly knows that cultivating the heart *is* cultivating the Dao.

At the end of each daily record, how could this suffice to reflect the celestial heart’s seal of approval? The scripture states: “Heavenly nature is human; the human heart is mechanism.” This responds to that, as shadow follows form—nothing is hidden in darkness, nothing concealed in subtlety. Can one not be cautious?

In the *Discourse on Blessing, Wisdom, and Karma* presented to the Upper Clarity Daoist fraternity, it is said: the ancients taught that on the path between humanity and heaven, cultivating blessing comes first; in the ocean of birth and death, cultivating wisdom is fundamental. Those who focus solely on wisdom gather their nature and illuminate the heart, uphold precepts and stabilize concentration to strengthen wisdom and realize the Dao—thus they may transcend the suffering wheel of birth and death, ascending to immortal rank. Without planting the seeds of blessing, the path remains arduous; how can body and mind attain purity? Those who focus solely on cultivating blessing relieve the world and deliver others, widely practicing expedient means to build a foundation of blessing—thus in future lives they may be reborn among humans or gods, enjoying manifold pleasures. Yet without realizing the Dao, when their postmortem retribution is exhausted, they must return again.

Therefore, the essential path of advancement requires both blessing and wisdom, neither to be neglected. To enrich oneself alone is insufficient; self-benefit and benefiting others ensure mutual fulfillment. In ancient times, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning expounded the scriptures, and an entire nation’s men and women received protection and deliverance. Lord Lao cultivated himself, and his virtue became authentic; when he extended cultivation to the world, his virtue became universal. Confucius’ mastery of the self and return to ritual led all under heaven to embrace humaneness—from sincerity of intention and rectification of the heart to governance of the state and peace under heaven, all serve to perfect oneself and others. The Buddha is called the Honored One of Two Perfections because he possessed both blessing and wisdom.

Later, the Sixth Chan Patriarch worked as a pestle-hand, and Chan Master Lingji as a cook—both attained the Dao and subdued karmic dragons. Chan Master Sizhou attained the Dao and subdued the water mother. Patriarch Heavenly Master said: “My elixir is complete; consuming it, I would surely ascend. Yet now I must benefit the nation and the people, eliminating harm and promoting welfare, so that in the future, when I serve the Three Clarities, I may do so without shame.” Thus he entered Shu to subdue demons, distinguishing between humans and ghosts, reviving the salt trade, and bringing prosperity to the state. Master Ge the Immortal often used talismanic water to heal the sick, and through ritual refinement delivered eighty thousand ghostly souls. Immortal Xu of the Capital likewise used talismans and medicine to cure illness; after attaining the Dao, he slew a vicious flood dragon, his merit equaling that of the divine Yu. All endured hardship and spurred themselves to action, cultivating both blessing and wisdom before realizing the Dao.

Immortal Huan Kai practiced the High Leaping Way of the Sun and Moon. Hearing that Master Tao the Recluse had many disciples, he first sought employment as a garden laborer—thus attaining the Dao before cultivating blessing. Perfected Purple Clarity heard of the Great Return of Golden Liquid and traveled widely to perform rituals, relieving the world and delivering others. Only then did he succeed in refinement under the patronage of Minister Jin—thus cultivating blessing before attaining the Dao. From this, we know that while the teachings of immortals, Buddhas, and sages may differ, in their cultivation of self and others, they are one. Yet the cultivation of wisdom and blessing by immortals and Buddhas aims at delivering the world; the retribution of good and evil is verified across three lifetimes. The self-perfection and world-perfecting of sages aim at governing the world; the retribution of good and evil is verified in the present life—this is but a minor difference.

The scripture states: “Ghosts and spirits bring disaster to the licentious and bless the humble. Those who do good receive a hundred blessings; those who do evil receive a hundred calamities.” This principle of ghostly and spiritual karma, as expounded by sages, is certainly grounded in reason. In my youth, reading books, I understood it to be so. Yet after experiencing worldly affairs and observing past events, some cases defy facile explanation. The great sages Yao and Shun—could they not have ordered heaven and earth and nurtured the myriad things? Yet there came the nine-year flood that drowned the people. Knowing others is wisdom; appointing the capable is governance—yet in managing the flood, they mistakenly employed Gun. King Tang was also a sage, yet suffered seven years of drought; only after self-reproach for six faults did rain come—why did he not act sooner?

As for the worthy Yan who died young, the bandit Zhi who lived long, and Bo Dao who left no descendants—such cases from ancient times to the present are too numerous to record. Since the outbreak of war, I have observed in villages and hamlets those who for generations were virtuous scholars and cultivated gentlemen, well-versed in the classics and practicing self-cultivation—many remained impoverished, their blessings not manifesting in their own lives but in their descendants. Yet now their lines are extinguished without remnant; were they all unfilial? Meanwhile, those who were treacherous and violent now prosper and flourish. If we test this against the doctrine of present-life retribution for good and evil, it clearly fails. Yet if we apply the doctrine of three-lifetime karma, it is evidently trustworthy. Thus both doctrines should be upheld together to avoid oversight.

In ancient times, those who perished in floods were buried in fish bellies; in later ages, those who fill ditches and gullies, or suffer in the flames and mire of barbarian lands—how are they different? All are the fixed karma of past lives, meeting their moment to repay karmic debts. Observe today: the intelligent often suffer poverty and early death, while the dull-witted often enjoy longevity and wealth. Why? The intelligent focus solely on literature and disbelieve in karma; when they return again, their intelligence increases, but their poverty deepens.

The dull-witted, though they do not pursue literature, believe in and venerate good fortune; when they return again, their wealth and longevity increase, while their dullness remains unchanged. A common saying goes: *"Those who cannot speak rise to high office; those who cannot read amass gold in heaps."* There must be a reason for this. If one possesses both intelligence and literary cultivation while also cultivating good fortune, then in the life to come, wealth, nobility, intelligence, and wisdom should all be attained together.

Generally, all that a person does in life serves as the mold for their next existence. How could the Creator indulge them, merely shaping and pouring through borrowed hands? Some argue that after death, the spirit does not persist, and thus deny the cycles of karma and rebirth, dismissing the Way of Immortals as mere fantasy. This is to obscure one’s own true nature, inviting only the scorn of those beyond the world. When the spirit attaches to form, it becomes human; when a person dies and the spirit does not perish, it is called a ghost. *"Essence and qi become things"*—this is form. *"The wandering soul undergoes transformation"*—this is the ghost. The ancient sages knew that spirits have emotions and forms, that they can bring fortune or misfortune, blessings or calamities. When villagers perform the *nuo* exorcism, they don their court robes and stand upon the steps, believing this gives the ancestral spirits a place to rest, preventing them from being startled. Yet later scholars still dismiss the affairs of the unseen world and spirits as nonexistent.

The Qin army did not destroy Confucius’s residence because they heard the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo music within. If there were no spirits to preside over it, would it truly resound on its own? Master Shao’s poem says:
*"The body comes after Heaven and Earth,
The mind exists before them.
Heaven and Earth emerge from me—
What else is there to say?"*
How then can one claim the spirit can be extinguished?

The Yellow Emperor attained the Dao and rode a dragon into the heavens, as recorded in the annals. Master Zhu’s poem reads:
*"The golden tripod coils with dragon and tiger,
Three years to nurture the elixir of spirit.
With a single dose of the knife’s measure,
White daylight births wings and feathers."*
Can one still call the Way of Immortals mere fantasy?

In the past, there were those who debated against immortals yet later encountered them, those who slandered the Buddha yet ultimately followed him, and those who denied ghosts yet ultimately saw them. Their words reached their limit. These are all biased views of self and others, not worth debating. When some in this world question the affairs of immortals and spirits or the retribution of good and evil, their doubts may lead to neglect of moral exhortation and restraint. Thus, I have broadly cited earlier teachings to enlighten them.

Moreover, a person lives in this world with limited time, chasing endless things. When they close their eyes, it is like a dream, yet the six paths of rebirth are distinct. The common folk, ignorant of this, indulge their desires, mistaking suffering for joy, as if drunk and never awakening. For those of us who have heard this Way, it is fitting to strive diligently. To act without attachment to action—this is the true work of a great person. How can one follow worldly customs, chasing illusory conditions, and waste this life? It is truly lamentable. Therefore, I first present the teaching of cultivating both fortune and wisdom, hoping to encourage like-minded companions.

I have written this to seek the opinion of my friend, Master Wu Ziyu, the Daoist alchemist, and to record the insights of those who have attained the Dao and the lofty immortals. Do you agree or not?

**Preface to the Reprinting of the *Daodejing* and *Wenshi Jing* by the Scholars of Wudang Palace in Huguang**

The scriptures of the Daoist Canon all serve to transform the people toward goodness and ultimately toward the Dao. Having been transmitted for generations, many recite them. Yet among the works of the Most High Lord Lao, the *Daodejing*, and the Perfected Lord Guan Yin, the *Wenshi Jing*—both of which delve into the origins of nature and destiny, the workings of creation, and the mysteries of spirits—few recite them. Is this because their profound principles are too subtle to fathom? Or is it due to the scarcity of texts after the ravages of war?

Recently, Master Zhen Yi traveled from Qionglin to the sacred peaks of Song and Hua, gathering lost scriptures, and was moved to this lament. The Daoist scriptures passed through Jiangxia, and so he came to Wudang Palace, where he led the scholars to join efforts in carving and printing them, aiming to widely circulate these texts. Thus, I have written this preface.

The *Daodejing*, with its five thousand words, encompasses the great transformation; the *Guan Yinzi*, with its one hundred and eighty chapters, further expounds the subtle principles. These two books have been transmitted together, serving as the model for all sages. The mind is awakened through the classics—without the classics, the mind cannot be seen. The Dao is not transmitted through words—yet through words, the Dao is revealed. If one penetrates their depths, one can grasp what lies beyond words, spiritually transforming the people and establishing the imperial order.

Today, the Son of Heaven has already annotated these texts to broaden the sagely teachings and further their circulation in this enlightened age. Now, as we seek to renew their printing, collective effort is needed to bring this to completion. We have also included the lost writings from the Guanlou Temple, like the teachings emerging from the azure heavens and the floating paradise. May all who encounter these scriptures revere the Dao and honor virtue, all entering the gate of myriad mysteries. And may the virtuous scholars know how to wield the ancient to govern the present—this is the teaching without words.

**Eulogy in Sitting Transformation**

Withdrawing from the world yet harmonizing with its light, illusions end when conditions fade—alone, one transcends.
A pure wind pervades all realms, unbounded;
The radiant sun hangs in the sky, illuminating the great thousand worlds.
