**The Return to True Nature Collection**

**Title:** *The Return to True Nature Collection* (*Huanzhen Ji*). Compiled by Wang Jie (courtesy name Daoyuan) of the Yuan dynasty. Three scrolls. Based on the edition from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Supreme Mystery Section.

**Preface to *The Return to True Nature Collection***

The Dao of immortality has been esteemed since antiquity. When the Yellow Emperor sought the Way from Guangchengzi, the world came to revere the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, for Guangchengzi was none other than Laozi himself. The discourse on immortality began thus, with figures such as Jian Keng of the Tang, Xiaofu of the Xia, Wanqiu of the Shang, and Wang Qiao of the Zhou—immortals who were already present in the Three Dynasties. Yet it was during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, who built a thatched pavilion to receive scholars, that such teachings first became prominent.

By the time of the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, rulers were deluded by the arts of alchemists and physicians. Though men like Wang Cijiong and Dongfang Shuo did not follow true masters, their heterodox doctrines spread and became entangled, ultimately leading to their own downfall. Thus, the great scholars and eminent minds of the age arose to censure them, and rightly so.

Then came Wei Boyang of the Han, who modeled his *Triple Concordance* (*Cantong Qi*) after the *Book of Changes*, expanding upon the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* to elucidate the path of elixir refinement. He steered clear of the misguided practices of ingesting minerals, herbs, clouds, or mists, or relying on breathwork and physical regimens. Instead, he illuminated the natural principles of body, mind, spirit, and *qi*, employing the trigrams, hexagrams, and celestial markers as his measures. All aligned perfectly with the marvelous interplay of odd and even, images and numbers.

Later, Zhongli Quan transmitted these teachings to Lü Yan of the Tang, who upheld and expounded upon them. Through his songs, discourses, and debates, he largely restored the true intent of the tradition, and worthy successors have not been lacking in subsequent ages. In the Song dynasty, figures such as Zhang Ziyang, Shi Yaolin, Chen Niuwan, Bai Ziqing, Li Yuxi, and Li Qing’an all stood as paragons of their time. Their writings and doctrines were no less profound than those of Boyang, and in some cases, they achieved even deeper, wordless understanding.

Though separated by a thousand years, how is it that their words align as if tallying tokens? It is not by coincidence but by necessity. The principle remains the same across a thousand generations, as does the heart-mind. What diverges and causes confusion must be the false and deceptive doctrines—those that seek to impress the present or mislead future generations. How could they ever accord with the natural Way of body, mind, spirit, and *qi*?

Thus, the ancients insisted on transmitting the Dao only to the worthy, for the Way does not propagate in vain. Moreover, masters do not recklessly reveal their profound and hidden mysteries. As for students, if they lack the substance of accumulated merit and cultivated conduct, merely adorning themselves with empty formalities and false reputations, chasing fame and acclaim, how can they be spoken of in the same breath as the Dao? How could they ever give voice to its truths?

The Master of Chaotic Oneness of Xiujiang in Nanchang, having abandoned his former surname, was a man of vast learning. He once encountered an extraordinary person from whom he received secret transmissions, and he diligently set forth his discourses. I have long studied his words, and though we met briefly in a guest lodge, haste prevented me from fully exploring their depths. This spring, my disciple Yuan Wenyi returned from Wu, bringing with him the *Return to True Nature Collection* compiled by the master, and asked me to compose a preface.

After savoring its contents repeatedly, I find it truly conveys the essence of the golden elixir and the returning cinnabar. Its exposition of the subtle and the manifest, the fundamental and the functional, is such that one may grasp both principle and application. If one cultivates accordingly, even those who come after may rival Ziyang or Qing’an—who can say who will surpass whom?

Moreover, I have long lamented the superficial, reckless, and perverse habits of the age, which have spread and festered without end. Yet I rejoice that these words are sufficient to revitalize the decadence of our era. If steadfast scholars and upright individuals can discern the difference between jade and mere stone, then roaming the primordial radiance of the spirit’s inception or refining *qi* beyond the chaotic vastness of the primordial void will not be difficult. This is how one fully returns to the origin and comprehends the end, exhausting the divine and knowing transformation.

Perhaps one day, I may summon the yellow crane to descend from the empty skies, and together we shall discourse amidst the isles and peaks of the Xiang and Yue rivers—it is not too late. This book is presented here at the outset in anticipation of that day.

Written in the fifth month of summer, the *ren-shen* year of the Hongwu reign.
Preface by Zhang Yuchu, the Celestial Master.

**The Marvelous Principles of the Golden Elixir**

Three points like stars—its principle runs deep,
A hook suspends the moon’s arc, fixing rise and fall.
Should one awaken to this mystery within the mystery,
The mountains and rivers of the earth all turn to gold.

The Dao’s wonder within the mystery knows no bounds,
The three teachings transmit but a single mystery.
Grasp the true workings hidden within,
As crow flies and hare runs, never leaving the heavens.

The Mysterious Pass—a single aperture at the center,
Neither before nor behind, alone suspended in emptiness.
Silently turn the light inward to dwell here,
Naturally spirit and *qi* merge with the mystery as one.

Two jade rings linked in a pair,
*Qian* revolves and *Kun* turns, sharing a single origin.
Within lies a single true message—
Without a master’s transmission, speak not idly of it.

One aperture enfolds the workings of creation,
Three great medicines fuse within.
The *Xun* wind stirs the furnace’s fire,
Refining the divine elixir till the crucible glows red.

Nurtured like an infant in the ten-month womb,
The work reaches this point, shedding worldly dust.
Spiritual transformations manifest in all directions,
A single orb of radiance pierces through the crown.

Birthless and deathless, one attains the Golden Immortal,
A single point of light illumines the great thousand worlds.
Shattering empty space, the whole body is revealed,
Returning to the state before father and mother were born.

**Oral Instructions**
In the study of the Dao, first one must clearly discern the true crucible and furnace within the body. Next, one must recognize the completeness of the medicinal substances. Third, one must understand the methods of advancing and retreating the firing times. Only when these are all distinctly clarified may one begin the practice of refinement.

The Patriarch said: "Once you know where to begin, proceed from that very point." Some ask: "What does it mean to proceed?" Ah—this is the work itself. The principle of the work lies in unbroken practice through the twelve double-hours of the day and night. When the heart is empty and desireless, inwardly observe to cultivate one’s nature. When the winter solstice arrives and *gui* is born, then close the gates to restore one’s life. Internally, revolve the Celestial Stem without movement; externally, turn the Dipper’s handle to propel change. A single *qi* circulates throughout; the Three Primes return to the body. The true fire forges and refines, coalescing the golden embryo of empty *qi*—this is called the talismanic fire returning the elixir. With prolonged practice, it gradually congeals and solidifies, uniting with the great void and merging with the true Dao.

**Direct Pointers to the Golden Elixir**
The Mysterious Pass—a single aperture within the human body,
Above the kidneys, below the heart, west of the liver, east of the lungs.
Neither biased nor leaning, standing alone in emptiness,
Neither inside nor outside, the origin of the primordial beginning.
Without desire, cultivate nature; with desire, apply effort.
Fan open the furnace bellows, stir the *Xun* wind.
Thunder roars at the sea’s bottom, startling the harbor dragon.
Fire flames in the *Kan* position, ascending to the *Li* palace.
The Yellow Dame leads the bride, marrying her to the Metal Lord.
The three families meet, their affections harmonious.
The elixir congeals through nine revolutions, the crucible filled with rosy radiance.
Diligently gather, diligently refine, gradually congealing and enriching.
Unceasingly guard with steadfastness, warding off danger in the wild battle.
The spiritual embryo nurtured, pure yang *qi* surges.
Establish merit and conduct, your name reaching the upper heavens.
Shedding the embryo, spirit transforms—endless are the Dao’s wonders.

**The Three Treasures of the Human Body**
The Three Treasures of the Precelestial are the Three Substances—
The Dao of spontaneity:
Original essence, original *qi*, original spirit.

The Three Treasures of the Postcelestial are the Three Functions—
The Dao of effort:
Coital essence, breath *qi*, deliberative spirit.

The three treasures of the human body all arise from heaven and earth, residing in the precelestial to be born, their wondrous substance perfectly formed. In the postcelestial, they transform through the union of form and response. Without the precelestial, the postcelestial cannot be born; without the postcelestial, the precelestial cannot be completed. The principle of these two is one body differentiated—one must not lose the latter nor harm the former.

Thus, refine coital essence with original essence, refine breath *qi* with original *qi*, refine deliberative spirit with original spirit. When the three substances are perfectly fused, one merges with the true Dao. Naturally, original essence is firm and coital essence does not leak; original *qi* abides and breath *qi* does not escape; original spirit is whole and deliberative spirit does not arise.

The method of immortal cultivation has no other secret—it is simply to preserve these three. As the Patriarch said: "When essence is whole, desire is not thought of; when *qi* is whole, food is not thought of; when spirit is whole, sleep is not thought of." It is also said: "When the three are true and whole, one will surely ascend as an immortal; when the three are whole and true, one will surely ascend in flight." These words exhaust the matter—let the scholar savor them.

**The Three Passes of the Human Body**
Seize the *Kan* position to solidify the heart’s center...

Refining the *Li* palace within the abdomen’s yin,
The three passes of the human body are none other than essence, *qi*, and spirit.
Essence resides in *Kan*; *qi* resides in *Li*; spirit resides in the heart.
The initial pass refines essence into *qi*, drawing forth the yang within *Kan*.
The middle pass refines *qi* into spirit, replenishing the yin within *Li* to form *Qian*.
The upper pass refines spirit to return to emptiness, where the primordial *Qian* transforms and reverts to the *Kun* position, thereby congealing the elixir.
Once the elixir is congealed, spirit and *qi* become radiant and clear, merging with the Great Void as one body. Within and without, purity prevails, and one naturally unites with the true Dao.
Thus, in stillness, one nurtures inherent nature; in motion, one restores the mandate of life. Cultivating both nature and life, form and spirit attain wondrous perfection. This is the sublime secret of the cyclical firing process for returning the elixir.

Hence, a verse is composed to attest to this:
When the hour of *gui* arises within the body,
Draw the yang from *Kan* to replenish *Li*.
North Dipper and South Star invert their positions—
In a single moment, the foundation of the elixir is laid.

The half-*sheng* crucible,
Upholding heaven and propping up earth, is the half-*sheng* crucible.
Dragon and tiger seized, simmered together in one vessel.
Ten rounds of martial firing, refined with civil fire—
After nine revolutions, the elixir is complete, and one strides toward Penglai.

The half-*sheng* crucible is another name for the earthen cauldron.
Within the human body, it lies at the very center of heaven and earth, in the palace of *wu* and *ji*, the cavity of spirit and *qi*. With this, yin and yang may unite, and nature and life may be quickened.
As the Patriarch Lü Chunyang said:
*A single grain conceals the world; within the half-sheng crucible, mountains and rivers are stewed.*
So it is.
The scholar must not strain to conjecture but should receive transmission directly from an enlightened master before true understanding may dawn.

As the ancients said:
*"One may wear through iron shoes in fruitless search,
Yet find it effortlessly when the time is ripe."*

**Diagram of the Five Phases’ Transformations**
The Five Phases are the five numinous essences of the Three Powers. Though their forms in the Five Phases’ transformations are not uniform, their Dao is one. Thus, in heaven they become the five stars and the five emperors; on earth, the five sacred peaks and the five spirits; in the human, the five viscera and the five constants. Gathered into a single body, the Five Phases are therein as one. Scattered into the myriad forms, the Five Phases are also therein as one. Therefore, the essential practice of cultivating the Real consists solely in circulating these five qi. If one can preserve these five qi without dissipation, blending them into the Great Void, they coalesce into the golden embryo of empty qi—this is called the numinous elixir. But those who dull their spirit and chase after things are instead harmed by the Five Thieves.

Some may ask: What are the Five Thieves?
The Five Thieves are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and intent. Unless one is a person of the greatest spiritual capacity, one is seldom not deluded by these five and thus loses one’s nature. As the *Yinfu Jing* says: *"Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper."* The Buddha also taught: *"Without eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or intent; without form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or dharma."* Such is the case.

The work of attaining the Dao employs the three flowers gathering at the crown and the five qi returning to the origin—then transformations naturally emerge from the Five Phases.

**Diagram of the Heart’s Ease in the Great Dao**
Heaven’s creative transformations divide from the One Center.

Man weaves his great designs from the heart—
For the *Heart’s Ease* is the source of the Great Dao.

The Great Dao’s generation and transformation arise from nothing beyond the fifty-five numbers of the *River Chart*, which the sages took as their model. As Laozi said: *"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things."* The nameless beginning is the union of the Three and Five as one reality; the named mother is the division of the Three and Five into separate realities. Thus, that which is above form is called Heaven; that which is below form is called Earth; and that which arises between the two forms is called Man. Man, paired with Heaven and Earth, is called the Three Powers. When the Three Powers unite with the Dao, the myriad things are born of a single qi. Only Man receives the full essence of Heaven and Earth at birth: Heaven bestows spirit, Earth bestows essence, and the harmonious center bestows qi. These three are complete within the body, which is the undifferentiated Great Ultimate. As Master Zhou said: *"From Non-Ultimate comes the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate moves and generates yang, rests and generates yin."* When yang’s movement reaches its extreme, it returns to stillness—yin embraces the bowels. When yin’s stillness reaches its extreme, it returns to movement—yang gathers yin. Yin and yang seek each other and generate the five qi; the five qi divide and transform to produce the eight trigrams; the eight trigrams cycle to form the four seasons; the four seasons revolve without cease to generate the myriad things. The myriad things flourish, each returning to its root. Such is the constant ease of the Great Dao.

In the language of the elixir path, this is nothing more than circulating the *Heart’s Ease*, inverting yin and yang, and reverting spirit and qi. Thus, Qian and Kun serve as the gates of the *Ease*; Kan and Li are the mechanism of the sun and moon’s coming and going; Zhen and Dui mark the spring and autumn equinoxes at Mao and You. When refining the elixir, internally one contains the Three and Five, firmly sealed and unmoving; externally, the Wood of the eastern Three engenders the Fire of the southern Two, and the Metal of the western Four engenders the Water of the northern One. The four images each return to their Five, then the central emptiness of the true Earth of Wu and Ji divides and transforms, drawing the raised Earth of Wu back to the Kan position. Wood is compelled to generate Fire, steaming and fuming; Metal is pressed to generate Water, seething and boiling. At this moment, one stirs the pivot at the crown, slowly drawing out the yang within Kan to replenish the yin of Li, forming the body of Qian. Using the Earth of Ji, one retreats the tally from the Li position, gathering the five qi to circulate the thirty numbers of the celestial cycle, halting only at the Kun palace. There the Reverted Elixir coalesces, Wu and Ji return to their places, and one drinks deeply of the knife and spoon. The singular nature becomes profoundly serene, the four qi grow limpid and bright, and the Five and Ten are once more emptied.

The *Diagram of the Great Ultimate* states: *"The true of the Non-Ultimate, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously unite and congeal."* This is the principle. Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Three, Five, and One—just these three words,
Rarely understood in ancient or modern times.
The eastern Three and southern Two together make Five;
The northern One and western Four share the same.*
*Wu and Ji return to the generative Five;
The Three Families meet to form the Infant.
The Infant is the One containing true qi;
After ten months, the embryo is complete, and one enters the foundation of the sage."*
These words exhaust the matter; let the student savor them.

**Diagrams of Tun and Meng**
The two trigrams Tun and Meng are metaphors employed by the sages to illustrate the advance of fire and retreat of the tally. Yang ascends from below—this is Tun; yin retreats from above—this is Meng. Tun has Zhen below and Kan above: Zhen’s initial nine uses the Gengzi line, Kan’s six four uses the Wushen line. Meng has Kan below and Gen above: Kan’s initial six uses the Wuyin line, Gen’s six four uses the Bingxu line. The lines Zi, Shen, Yin, and Xu correspond to *yuan, heng, li,* and *zhen*. One trigram inverted becomes two trigrams, their bodies and functions interpenetrating, movement and stillness mutually dependent. Among the sixty-four hexagrams, each follows the same pattern. One hexagram has six lines; two hexagrams total twelve lines. In terms of a year, this corresponds to twelve months; in terms of a day, to twelve hours. Yang advances for six, yin retreats for six. The alchemical saying of "morning Tun and evening Meng" is merely a figurative way of discussing the clarity of fire times within the body, the subtleties of opening and closing, exhalation and inhalation.

Wei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* states: *"Tun uses Zi and Shen; Meng uses Yin and Xu. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its own day; I briefly present the two images, though I cannot exhaust them."* *Awakening to Reality* also says: *"The Southern and Northern Schools reverse the hexagram images; morning and evening fire times align with the celestial pivot."* These words are clear. Yet students must not take mere words on paper as full understanding; they must seek a enlightened teacher’s guidance to recognize the hexagrams within their own bodies. The discourse on hexagrams is also a metaphor—it is only because the sages had no choice that they borrowed images to guide later students. Once the decisive word breaks through, the Dao of Heaven and Earth and the self will be in perfect resonance.

**Diagram of the Celestial Cycle Fire Times**
Eleven
Thirty Spokes

A single hub unites them all.

The Celestial Cycle Fire Times embody the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing, the transformation of Yin and Yang. In the vastness of Heaven and Earth, in the smallness of the human body, all possess the numerical patterns of generative fire times. The *Book of Changes* states: *"One opening, one closing is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration."* Thus, in the human body, exhalation connects to the root of Heaven, inhalation to the root of Earth. Each exhalation and inhalation naturally harmonizes with the creative workings of Heaven and Earth. Yet this breath is not the breath of mouth and nose—it is the inner movement of a single vital breath. For this reason, the ancestral masters established words and images to guide those who would come after. Texts such as the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger*, the *Triplex Unity*, and the *Six Hundred Fire Records* all elucidate the fire times, truly desiring that people practice this Dao.

Thus, a year is condensed into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, an hour into a single breath. Within the work of a single breath, one advances the Yang fire and retreats the Yin tally, seizing the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi, reversing the seventy-two seasonal nodes at their crucial passes. A grain of millet-like pearl is produced, descending into the Yellow Court, where emptiness and fullness merge, the sacred qi congeals into truth, and the sacred embryo is formed—this is called the tally-fire returned elixir.

Zhang Ziyang said: *"Without marking time to divide Zi and Wu, within the hexagrams and lines, Qian and Kun are determined."* Liao Zhenzi said: *"The great medicine consists of three: essence, qi, and spirit; naturally, mother and child embrace one another. Returning wind and merging into the true body, the forging work renews day by day."* Master Shao also said: *"When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon’s Grotto; when Earth meets Thunder, tread the Heavenly Root. Freely coming and going between Heavenly Root and Moon’s Grotto, the thirty-six palaces are all spring."* These all elucidate the principles of fire times.

Practitioners of the true, even if they possess the three impermeabilities yet do not practice the work of fire times, remain within Yin and will ultimately only produce a Yin spirit, unable to manifest a Yang spirit. Lü Chunyang thus spoke of the *"clay in the kiln."* Yet clay in the kiln, unrefined by fire, remains mere earth—how can it become firm? The human body is likewise like clay in the kiln. Without practicing the work of fire times and refining the medicine, one will never achieve the wondrous union of form and spirit, merging with the Dao in truth.

Thus, the sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire—since ancient times, few have known the fire times. This is the ancestral masters’ untransmitted secret, not that it was not transmitted, but that it is only passed to those worthy of receiving it. How could it be spoken of lightly?

**The Three Essentials of Internal Alchemy**
1. The Crucible
2. The Medicine
3. The Fire Times

Spirit within Qi, Yang within Yin, Twenty-Four Qi, Seventy-Two Seasonal Nodes, Twenty-Eight Constellations, Sixty-Four Hexagrams, Twelve Fields, Sun and Moon in Conjunction, Tides Rising and Falling, Thirty-Two Heavens, Thirty Civil Lines, Seventy Military Refinements.

These three essentials are the secret keys to cultivating the true. The essentials of cultivation are three: first, know the crucible; second, know the medicine; third, know the fire times. Only when these three are clearly understood may one begin the practice. Though their names vary endlessly, they are but different terms to dispel the learner’s confusion.

The crucible is the Heavenly Heart. The medicine is essence and qi. The fire times are spirit and qi. Within the twelve double-hours, turn the light inward, reflect, and maintain continuity as if barely present—like a hen brooding her eggs, like a dragon nurturing its pearl. Naturally, spirit governs qi, and qi nourishes spirit, merging within the heart to become one with the Great Void.

At such a time, there is no medicine, no fire times—one spirit is all spirits, one qi is all qi. Yet even so, the field of the heart and the sea of nature cannot remain eternally still. Stillness reaches its extreme and must move, giving rise to Yang. Yang is the winter solstice, the time when Gui is born within the human body. At this moment, one must close the gates and practice the fire times: stir the Xun wind, fan the furnace bellows, order the five qi, harmonize the hundred spirits, raise the Wu earth, seal Gen and Dui, draw forth the Yang within Kan to replenish the Yin within Li. Before the intent ceases, Wu gathers the medicine with Ji earth and returns it together, sending it into the crucible. The Xun gate opens on both sides, true fire refines it, and the golden elixir is formed, imperishable for ten thousand kalpas.

Thus, the more the elixir is refined, the firmer it becomes; the more the practice is accumulated, the deeper it grows. Diligently cultivating this, one may indeed hope for the Dao of immortality—how could this be empty words?

*The Upper Scroll of the Return to the True concludes. The Middle Scroll of the Return to the True begins.*

**On the Secret Essentials of the Returned Elixir**
The Returned Elixir is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin. At birth, humans receive the father’s essence and mother’s blood, and in early infancy, the original essence, original qi, and original spirit are all perfectly whole. As one gradually matures, the four gates—eyes, ears, nose, and tongue—become enticed, and the single numinous true nature is touched by form, sound, fragrance, and taste, growing ever more deeply habituated. Day after day, year after year, the original essence transforms into generative essence, the original qi into breathing qi, and the original spirit into the spirit of thought and worry. These Three Origins dissipate, making it difficult to recover one’s celestial authenticity. Thus, the ancestral masters transmitted their teachings, recording them in the elixir classics to show people the methods of cultivation and restoration. If essence is depleted, replenish it with essence; if qi is depleted, replenish it with qi; if spirit is depleted, replenish it with spirit—this is the Dao of returning to the root and restoring the origin.

What does "restoration" entail? It means taking the preservation of essence as the deep root, the preservation of qi as the firm stem, and the preservation of spirit as the wondrous union. If one can preserve these Three, they truly become the genuine medicinal substances within the body. Yet even so, without knowing the methods of applying the firing times and refining with fire, one remains bound to Yin and will never attain the Dao of perfecting both form and spirit.

Who would have known that the human Dao aligns with Heaven and Earth? A single breath of effort seizes a year’s transformation from Heaven and Earth. Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel; the sun and moon as water and fire; the crow and hare as the medicinal substances; Yin and Yang as the mechanism of transformation; the dragon and tiger as the wondrous function; Zi and Wu as the winter and summer solstices; Mao and You as the spring and autumn equinoxes. These are all metaphorical allusions—yet in truth, they do not extend beyond the three words: body, heart, and intent. The body is tied to essence, the heart to qi, and the intent to spirit.

"Return" means reversing the course of these Three; "restore" means restoring these Three to their true state. When the Three are whole and united with the true, this is called the Returned Elixir. Fearing that learners might cling to one-sided views and fail to grasp this principle, I dare not fear heavenly retribution and must reveal this celestial mechanism.

Whenever entering the chamber to refine the elixir, one must empty the heart and still the nature, merging spirit and qi within the Central Field. When the first Yang stirs—this is the winter solstice within the body. At this moment, one must close the gates, raise Wu earth to seal the depths of the sea abyss, and not rashly employ the hidden dragon. Only when the dragon appears in the field should one turn the pivot at the crown gate, slowly lifting it from the Great Mystery Palace. With one ascent, three hours pass, and the flying dragon penetrates the Three Passes; with another ascent, three more hours pass, and it ascends to the Southern Palace for union. This is drawing the Yang from Kan to replenish the Yin within Li. From Zi to Si, the six Yangs gather in Qian. Beyond this, Yang has no end in principle, yet a single Yin arises beneath the five Yangs, and Kun Yin takes charge. With Ji earth, one retreats the Yin tally from Li, descending the Magpie Bridge at the Golden Gate, entering the Crimson Palace through the Towering Chambers, and returning it to the earthen crucible. From Wu to Hai, the six Yin tallies complete. Yang reclaims Kun’s position, the Xun gate opens on both sides, and true fire refines it, forming the golden embryo of empty qi—this is called the Returned Elixir.

Refining the medicine in accordance with the times, applying the tallies in harmony with the cycles, diligently tempering and refining, transforming the insubstantial into substance—after ten months of work, the embryo is perfected, the crucible is changed, and the spirit is moved to dwell in the Mud Pill Palace. The Heavenly Gate bursts open, and one carefully nurtures the emerging spirit. At this time, one must stand firmly on solid ground, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Only when spiritual powers are fully rounded and transformations are free will one penetrate stone and pass through metal, respond to circumstances as they arise, roam the clouds at ease, and enjoy boundless joy—attaining the status of a true immortal who transcends the kalpas, all through resolute cultivation.

The wondrous function of elixir refinement begins with effort and ends in effortlessness. Nature is established upon life, and life is cultivated through nature. When nature and life merge, they become one with the Great Void—what bondage of life and death could remain? This is the unchanging great method transmitted by the sages. To seek other wonders beyond this is to stray into heterodox paths.

Some may cut off thoughts to guard emptiness, or abstain from grain to starve the body; some may fix their minds in silent audience, or swallow mist and inhale qi; some may practice massage and guiding exercises, or imagine fire burning the navel; some may choose beautiful women as crucibles and vessels, prizing unyielding virility as victory in battle; some may take female essence as the elixir’s head, using the union of yin and yang as their wondrous function; some may enter the chamber at Zi and Wu hours to sit in meditation, or refrain from firing times during Mao and You months—such minor paths number in the thousands. These are all side doors and narrow trails; how could they be worthy of discussion as the Dao?

The ancestral masters said: "The Dao has three thousand six hundred gates, and each person clings to one as their root. Yet within these, the subtle and mysterious essence lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates." These words say it all. Learners must be careful not to cling and thus delude themselves. Have you not heard the ancients say: "If one does not meet a true master at the outset, one will grow old and become a mere antique"?

The essentials of cultivating the true lie in exhaustively investigating principle and fully realizing nature, investigating things to extend knowledge, and only then returning to the root and restoring life—only thus can one verify the great Dao. Without seeking a true teacher’s guidance, even with the talents of Yan or Min, one will not succeed. Let the learner ponder this.

**On the Fusion of Nature and Life**
Nature is the single numinous spirit within the human body. Life is the single original Yang true qi within the human body. Life does not arise without nature, and nature does not stand without life. Before the parents’ birth, the spirit was contained within the empty qi alone—luminous and clear, lacking nothing, with nothing in excess.

After the parents’ birth, the single original true qi resides between the two kidneys, within the empty and mysterious aperture—here life is established, and here too nature lodges in the body. Establishing nature and establishing life, this is called the "Heavenly Heart," also known as "Heaven’s mandate as nature." Nature is the master of the entire human body; life is its root. In daily activity, responding to the myriad affairs depends on nature, while accomplishing the hundred tasks belongs to the body. Nature enables the activation of subtle transformations; life enables the transmutation of yin and yang. When nature responds to things, life serves as its substance and nature as its function; when life operates and transforms, nature serves as its substance and life as its function. Substance and function share a single source, manifest and subtle without separation—only then can it be called the Dao. Neither can be lacking.

The Dao of refining the returning elixir is nothing more than the fusion of spirit and qi, restoring the original wholeness of nature and life. The substance of nature is Qian; the substance of life is Kun. The primordial Qian belongs to metal; the primordial Kun belongs to earth. Qian metal resides within Kun earth and is concealed—mother and child guard one another, with nature as the child and life as the mother. As the alchemical classics say, "Let it be the host and I the guest," thus borrowing the body as the host’s function.

The *Book of Changes* states: "Great indeed is the primordial Qian, from which all things receive their beginning"—this is nature. "Profound indeed is the primordial Kun, from which all things receive their birth"—this is life. The *Dao De Jing* says: "Always be desireless to observe its mystery"—this is the substance of nature in Qian. "Always have desire to observe its manifestations"—this is the function of life in Kun. Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Changes*, and truly the root and origin of the substance and function of nature and life.

Nature and life are spirit and qi; spirit and qi are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are Kan and Li; Kan and Li are the sun and moon; the sun and moon are water and fire. When water and fire achieve balance, wondrously uniting and congealing, this is the Dao of the fusion of nature and life.

At the moment of their fusion, the heart is empty and luminously clear, without form or name, without substance or function. When nature and life emanate and ascend, yang moves and yin separates—there is form and name, substance and function. At this point, practicing the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation*, substance and function then divide into inner and outer. Internally, nature resides in the Central Palace and governs movement—this is substance. Externally, the emotions circulate with the Dipper’s handle in cyclic return—this is function. Preserve it with sincerity, employ it with truth, and naturally the elixir will form in the crucible, nurturing the sacred embryo. Like an infant in the womb, after ten months the qi is complete, the embryo sheds its form through spiritual transformation, a body exists beyond the body, and the perfected one appears—thus the great task of dual cultivation of nature and life is accomplished.

All those who study the Dao and attain the Way, along with eminent Chan practitioners, must not cling rigidly; only through the dual cultivation of nature and life can the great task be achieved. Master Lü said: "Cultivating only the golden elixir without cultivating nature is the foremost illness in practice. Only understanding true nature without refining the elixir—even after ten thousand kalpas, the radiant spirit will hardly enter sagehood." These words say it all.

If one cultivates only nature without life, after the body’s death, nature becomes a yin spirit and cannot manifest spiritual powers. If one cultivates only life without nature, though the body may achieve longevity, it remains bound to form and cannot transcend the kalpas. Both are cases of solitary yin or solitary yang, falling into the study of lopsided desiccation.

What then is the dual cultivation of nature and life? Have you not heard: "Comprehending nature leads to sagehood—this heart connects with all hearts, wisdom is vast, and nothing that comes is unknown." "Comprehending life leads to longevity—this body endures through kalpas unharmed, able to transform all forms, and nowhere it goes is it not transformed." Only when nature and life are both complete is the Dao attained; only when form and spirit are both wondrous is the golden immortal realized. What doubt can there be? What doubt can there be?

**On Curbing Anger and Restraining Desire**
Curbing anger and restraining desire are the essentials of the sage’s self-cultivation and careful conduct. Curbing anger is to discipline the heart; restraining desire is to halt thoughts. Disciplining the heart prevents anger from arising; halting thoughts prevents desire from emerging. When anger does not arise, the heart is naturally clear; when desire does not emerge, the emotions are naturally still. With a clear heart and still nature, the Dao naturally congeals.

Thus, the noble one who cultivates this prospers; the petty person who violates it meets misfortune. How can one not know: if anger is not curbed, the heart’s fire flames upward, and the celestial nature is obscured by clouds. If desire is not restrained, the yang essence rushes downward, and the bitter sea’s waves surge. Thus, one drifts in the realm of life and death, sinking into the depths of love and desire—then the true unified qi originally bestowed by Heaven and Earth stealthily flees and lodges in Kun.

Proceeding thus, Kun rides Qian’s solitary yang to become Kan, while Qian, broken by Kun, loses its solitary yang to become Li. Li accumulates yin and generates anger; Kan accumulates yang and generates desire. Examine this: anger arises from qi, desire from essence. When qi stirs, anger gives rise to greed and hatred; when essence stirs, desire clings to delusion and attachment. Externally, one clashes and grinds against things; internally, one’s own spirit and essence dissipate, falling into the dark paths and forever losing the true Dao—how lamentable!

Thus, I record the words of the ancient sages as a mirror for later learners. The Most High said: "Attain utmost emptiness, maintain profound stillness, and while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return." The *Book of Changes* states: "Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?" Gautama said: "Do not give rise to the mind in response to form, sound, fragrance, taste, touch, or dharma; give rise to the mind without abiding anywhere." He also said: "All that has form is illusory; if one sees that all forms are not form, one sees the Tathāgata." Confucius said: "The Dao is that from which one cannot depart even for a moment; what can be departed from is not the Dao." He also said: "Rectify the heart, sincerely cultivate the will, and do not, even for the time of a meal, depart from benevolence."

Yanzi neither displaced his anger nor repeated his errors, mastering himself to return to ritual propriety, and for three months did not depart from benevolence. Master Zeng said: "The eyes of ten men gaze upon him, the fingers of ten men point at him—how solemn this is! Thus the noble person must be vigilant in his solitude." Zisi said: "If utmost virtue and the supreme Dao do not congeal within, [all effort is in vain]." Mencius therefore declared: "I am skilled in nourishing my vast and overflowing qi, which fills the space between Heaven and Earth, utmost in magnitude and firmness. It is nurtured with uprightness and suffers no harm."

All these exemplify the Dao of curbing wrath and restraining desire to preserve the Great Harmony. In the alchemical tradition, this is the principle of "drawing from Kan to fill Li," the regulation of Water and Fire in perfect balance; in the Chan tradition, it is the principle of "turning the light inward to reflect," transforming the passions of the material world into emptiness; in the Confucian tradition, it is the principle of "mastering oneself to return to ritual propriety," rectifying the heart and sincerely cultivating the will.

Thus considered, the Three Teachings share the same Dao though their names differ; in truth, they do not depart from the wondrous workings of the single heart. Therefore, Heaven and Earth possess no second Dao, and the sages harbor no dual hearts. Let learners not regard the four characters "curbing wrath and restraining desire" as easily dismissed—this is the pivotal mechanism of cultivating the true. Its essential nature lies in reduction: diminishing the external to augment the internal. When the internal is settled, qi harmonizes; when qi harmonizes, spirit harmonizes; when spirit harmonizes, the Dao becomes serene.

At this stage, one transcends yin and yang, emerges from life and death, and moves freely without entanglement, ascending Peng Isle, roaming the Grotto-Heavens, transforming at will—how profoundly mysterious! Such talk—is it not like speaking of dreams?

Dreams, in their essence, arise from the transformations of qi. When yang governs yin, the hun spirit restrains the po soul, and if the spirit dreams, it is luminous and clearly perceived. When yin governs yang, the po soul restrains the hun spirit, and the spirit becomes obscured by worldly desires—thus dreams wander in confusion, dim and indistinct.

Of old, the Divine Farmer, grieving over the people’s suffering, dreamed of ascending to the celestial court, where the Heavenly Sovereign bestowed upon him the book of herbal testing. The Yellow Emperor, yearning for the Dao, dreamed of wandering the land of Huaxu’s grand palace. Zhuang Zhou discoursed on the Dao and thus dreamed of transforming into a butterfly. Confucius praised the *Zhouyi* and thus dreamed of meeting the Duke of Zhou. In these sages, the heart and the Dao were profoundly united; their dreams arose from resonance, their yang spirit blazing through the host of yin. Bright and radiant, though dreams, they were not mere dreams—such is the wondrous work of the spirit emergent. Thus, the dreams of ordinary people are worlds apart.

The hearts of ordinary people cling to their affairs, drifting upon the sea of desire, sinking into the river of attachment. How could they know that the single spark of original spirit, by day, dwells in the head? The eyes covet forms, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the eyes. The ears covet sounds, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the ears. The nose covets fragrances, and the spirit clings to them—this is the dream within the nose. The mouth covets flavors, and the spirit is stained by them—this is the dream within the mouth. By night, the spirit returns to nest in the heart; as soon as sleep comes, the yin po envelops the hun, and dreams become turbid and chaotic, seeing all manner of things, upside-down and inverted, shifting with every thought. Thus, whether eyes are open or closed, dreams arise.

This is because the field of the heart is impure, and the spirit does not abide in its chamber. Day by day, month by month, the essence and spirit dissipate, and so one falls into the six destinies, entering the realm of dreams and illusions. As the ancients said, the root of life and death is but a single thought—creation itself is dreamlike, the very root of life and death.

Therefore, the great cultivator has no dreams. By day, they are free and untrammeled; by night, they are likewise free and untrammeled. Spirit guards qi, and qi embraces spirit, merging into a single whole, transcending beyond yin and yang—what dreams could there be? If the learner of the Dao can recognize that dreams are but dreams and master them, they stand beyond life and death, unobscured by yin and yang. Let the learner ponder this.

**On Nature**
Nature is the primordial, singular spark of utmost numinosity within the human body—this is the original spirit. This numinosity existed before parents gave birth, never increasing; it remains after birth, never diminishing. It is inherently complete, neither lacking nor in excess.

Thus, when a person is born, their nature is never not good, though their qi and material endowment differ, each receiving its own distinct allotment. Hence, there is the original nature and the nature of qi and material endowment. The original nature is awareness and movement; the nature of qi and material endowment is greed, wrath, delusion, and attachment.

Therefore, those of superior wisdom awaken to their original nature, unentangled by even a thread, all dharmas luminously clear. Those of middling wisdom are half-enlightened, half-deluded: when they grasp it, it remains; when they let go, it vanishes. Those of lesser wisdom have no hold on their spirit, their thoughts giving rise to emotions, clinging to their affairs.

Observing these three, we see that nature has gradations. Some may ask: The Buddha said that all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature—why then are human natures graded? Ah! Even the father and child of tigers and wolves, the ruler and subjects of bees and ants, are not without Buddha-nature—it is their forms that differ. The nature of humans and the myriad things is the same; the forms of humans and the myriad things differ.

Nature is like the moon in the sky; form is like water upon the earth. When the myriad waters are clear, the single moon shines universally; when the myriad waters are turbid, the single moon is universally dim. It is not that the moon is bright or dim—it is that the waters are clear or muddy. Those who become sages, wise ones, or worthies receive the clear qi; those who become fools, dullards, or evildoers receive the turbid qi. Thus, the Buddha said: *A thousand rivers hold a thousand moons; ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky.* Such is the truth.

This single spark of luminous clarity is formless and without appearance, timeless and without age, piercing stone and penetrating metal—there is fundamentally nothing to be said of it. If one can penetrate and see through this point, unshaken by any realm, inwardly observing the heart in unbroken continuity, forging it into a single whole, standing alone in the void—then one naturally has the adamantine gate of protection, all demons disperse, and one may speak as an equal with the ancient Buddhas.

If the learner of the Dao does not understand the work of inwardly guarding stillness within the true nature, even if they can recite the entire canon, wielding eloquent speech, in the end they will only waste their essence and spirit, to no benefit. All conditioned dharmas, having attainment, also have failure—seeking the true by clinging to forms? All is delusion. If one merely practices the unconditioned dharma, eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, one may yet fall into dead emptiness.

This single circle ○ rolls like a pearl upon a plate, perfectly round and following the earth, vibrantly alive—it is not being, nor is it non-being, nor is it attached to any single thing. How does the assembly comprehend this?

Ah! *After the rain, the river is empty, the mountain colors still; a single crow’s cry in the bright moonlight.*

**Song**
Nine Songs of the Whirling Wind Mingled as One

**First Song**
The Celestial Sovereign descends from the south to dwell in the Purple Palace,
The Three Passes sealed fast, summoning the Yellow Lad.
From the east, a whip cracks—dragons stir in the hidden sea,
Their crimson waves surging, soaring into the vast sky.
The Six Dings hurl fire, charging forth,
Fierce steeds storming Kunlun’s peak.
A thousand-mile chime summons the yin winds,
Divine warriors clash like tigers in the wild.
The Three Pengs’ fate lies shattered like bamboo,
The Six Thieves annihilated, their power spent.
With one cleansing, the restoration is secured,
Essence flows, the Cavern gleams, radiant with yang’s crimson.
Heaven and earth, the six directions merge as one,
The sovereign ascends the great throne, ruling the ninefold heights.
Myriad lands’ ministers and lords come to pay homage,
The people at peace, the realm prosperous, virtue’s grace profound.
The harvests flourish, the year sings of abundance.

**Second Song**
The Immortal Maiden of Nine Flowers ascends the Yellow Court,
From the Tail Gate, the sun births golden essence.
Its radiance transforms into moon-cave ice,
A pure stream flowing west, crystalline and bright.
The Flowery Pond waters the sprouting Yellow Sprout,
Deep-rooted true qi steams ceaselessly.
Jade branches and gem leaves bloom with sacred blossoms,
Spring winds stir, celestial fragrance perfumes the air.
Spirit clear and luminous, dwelling in the distant void,
Embracing truth, holding simplicity like a newborn babe.
Within this, the message holds boundless feeling,
Heaven and earth, sun and moon shine day and night.
The embryo congeals for ten months, the sacred form complete,
The Heavenly Gate splits with a thunderous crack.
The Perfected One appears—who dares contest?
Riding clouds, straddling a crane, they ascend to Jade Capital.

**Third Song**
The Crimson Child of the east is called Wood Lad,
At midnight, he cradles the sun from the sea’s depths.
Dragon soaring, chariot ascending Fusang,
Red wheels rising straight to heaven’s center.
Light illumines the cloud-brocade robes,
Timely as the Petal Maidens return to the grotto chamber.
Their passions unite, spring’s heart fragrant,
A single drop of true essence births the mysterious yellow.
Dwelling in chaos yet containing pure radiance,
Mouth full of rich fragrance, flowing jade nectar.
Drink and feast—every limb at ease,
Reversing age, returning to youth, heaven and earth endure.

**Fourth Song**
Heaven’s metal, dark in hue; earth’s soil, hidden,
The Xun wind stirs, the furnace’s fire blazes bright.

**Fifth Song**
In an instant, tempered into diamond-hard,
Forged as the wisdom-sword named Ganjiang.
Its three-foot edge keen as autumn frost,
Ghost-spirits lose their courage, dragons and tigers submit.
The Seven Stars nightly radiate their light,
Wielded crosswise or inverted—its power boundless.

**Sixth Song**
The golden womb, empty qi enfolding Qian’s origin,
Behind the life-gate, before the secret portal.
Rising high within the circle, neither leaning nor slanting,
Precisely centered, two inches hold the mystery.
The Yang Lord grasps heaven and earth’s primacy,
Circulating the four virtues in ceaseless revolution.
From Kunlun, a single stream flows westward,
Pouring downward a thousand feet, the Silver River hangs suspended.
Dewdrops scatter into the Golden Valley Garden,
Where peach blossoms bloom for three thousand years.
Pluck and eat them to stabilize the cinnabar field,
And become an ageless immortal among men.
When the time comes, ascend straight to Nine Flowers’ peak,
Where white clouds and yellow cranes come fluttering.

**Seventh Song**
The sun emerges from the vaulted sky, illuminating the eight wilds,
At Qujiang’s heights, the golden crow soars.
The Central August Elder sits in the Jade Hall,
Holding a purple flute to play the *Dongzhang*.
At the first note, the sea waters surge,
At the second, the moonlight’s glow falls away.
The third note blends all into primordial chaos,
And the music of the celestial court fills the heavens.
At this moment, drinking alone the *tihu* nectar,
The five viscera grow distinctly cool.
Limbs as if drunk, form and substance forgotten,
Unknowing where this land of nowhere lies.

**Eighth Song**
At Eastern Flower’s first dawn, the dawn light parts,
The Five Elders pay homage to the Purple Throne.
Holding the Three Flowers, they offer them to the Emperor Lord,
A single sphere of harmonious qi revives yang spring.
At heaven’s center, sun and moon shine with renewed brilliance,
From the four directions, all blessings gather as guests.
The nine movements of the flute tame phoenix and simurgh,
Eastern splendor reaches its zenith—customs grow pure.
Rivers and seas fall silent, mountains veil themselves in clouds,
The myriad people delight in their labors, heaven and earth grow clear.

**Ninth Song**
When the morning sun strikes the stone, purple clouds arise,
Drifting with the wind toward Kunlun.
Feathered canopies cast their shade in floating mists,
Flowing essence and jade light gleam freshly white.
Descending straight through the Wu-Ji Gate,
Snowflakes swirl in the empty sky.
Spirit sprouts flourish, jade flowers bloom in spring,
Deep roots and firm stems ensure long life.
Form and spirit both wondrous, the Dao unites with the real,
Freely roaming forever as Penglai’s people.

**Song of Cultivating the Real, Bestowed upon the Chaos-Dwelling Disciple**
To cultivate the real, first seek the true earth,
Establish the crucible in the southwest as the elixir mother.
The female gate and mysterious portal open left and right,
Regulate the breath, unbroken, to return qi to the ancestor.
The spirit dwells in chaos, the empty mystery,
No south, no north, no west, no east.
The four images and five phases all converge,
Turn the light inward to behold true emptiness.
True emptiness, bright and clear, without the slightest veil,
A single expanse of autumn sky, boundless.
The moon shines upon the Heavenly Altar, jade dew chills,
Within this realm, heaven and earth attain their true meaning.
At the first stirring of yang, heavenly water is born,
Thunder roars at noon, striking the third watch.
Riding the tiger, seize the lead from the water palace,
Mounting the dragon, capture the mercury to return to Crimson Mound.
Lead and mercury refined in the furnace by true fire,
Tempered into diamond hardness like iron.
A single grain of millet falls into the Yellow Court,
The Great One contains the real, the sacred embryo forms.
Spring winds fill the earth, the yellow sprout deepens,
After drinking the medicinal pellet, sing of jade simplicity.
Drunk, play a tune on the no-holes flute,
Its wondrous sound flies forth as the music of the celestial spheres.
At this moment, the joy of attainment is truly delightful,
This family’s tradition is most purely refined.
The blind see clearly, the deaf hear keenly,
The mute taste honey—yet to whom can they speak?
Without leaving the courtyard, know the ten thousand states,
Coming and going, roam boundlessly, the spirit knows no limits.
The great image, formless, hides in the indistinct,
Sun and moon shine day and night without cease.
Carefree and content, delighting in long life,
Shatter the void, shed the mortal husk.
Pierce heaven and earth, transcend death and life,
Resplendent divine light illumines the vast expanse.
Three thousand deeds complete, eight hundred merits fulfilled,
Utter loyalty and perfect filial piety return the light to the wind.
Above, move the Heavenly Emperor to send down a cinnabar edict,
Riding clouds in broad daylight, ascend to the celestial palace.

**Hunran Song**
The Daoist of Hunran—none know his name,
Hidden in a three-household village, his traces concealed.
Neither coming nor going, ever alone and abiding,
Formless and nameless, yet utterly distinct.
A single point of light is the Dao’s scripture,
Bright and mysterious, concealed in empty stillness.
At times, following transformation, he emerges,
When chaos splits open, he dwells in the Great Rescue.
Movement is ruled by yang, stillness by yin,
Heaven and earth are born from a single breath.
One gives birth to two, two to three,
The ten thousand images, the forest of phenomena, open and close as one.
Qian revolves, Kun turns, the mechanism never ceases,
Sun and moon revolve, twin jades conjoin.
What does the Daoist of Hunran do?
Each day, he meets people to discourse on the *Zhouyi*.
Within the *Yi*, creation’s workings are not hard to know—
In broad daylight beneath the blue sky, thunder crashes.
The tiger roars on Eastern Mountain, ten thousand forests tremble,
The dragon coils in Western River, waves rise a thousand feet.
In an instant, dragon and tiger return together,
The eight poles are dustless, the sky’s hue azure.
At this moment, Hunran alone delights,
Washing his feet in empty mystery, seated at the center.
Moonlight cleanses my flesh and bones,
From Nine Flowers Heaven, fragrant liquid flows.
Drink and feast—life endures long,
Drunk, play a tune on the no-holes flute.
The great sound fills the ten directions when released,
The subtle sound, when gathered, hides in secrecy.
Firm roots and deep stems—Dao arises of itself,
Emerging from death, transcending life, ever in unity.
Unbroken and silent, never leaving the stream,
For ten months, nurture the embryo—guard it, do not lose it.
When the time comes, shatter the upper barrier,
Myriad rosy clouds illuminate Penglai’s blossoms.
Above, dwell in Mud Pill Palace to pay homage to the Sacred One,
The immortals of the Three Isles gather in the jade chamber.
Beyond kalpas, carefree as a solitary wanderer,
No longer keeping days with the dusty world.
If people could understand the *Hunran Song*,
Only then would their cultivation and studies be complete.

**Zhongyang Song**
The Master of the Bamboo Grove, refined and secluded in nature,
Born between earth below and heaven above.

The Primordial envelops the Great Ultimate, named the Central Yang,
A single speck of radiance—priceless in the world.
Neither behind nor ahead,
Vast as a millet grain, suspended in empty space.
It transforms and births the myriad heavens, forests of phenomena,
The Dipper’s pivot revolves ceaselessly through day and night.
Neither below nor above,
Five *zhang* from the earth, the golden crow takes flight.
From its beak emerges a crimson wheel,
Illuminating Samantabhadra astride the white elephant.
The Gate of Heaven closes, the Door of Earth opens,
A single *qi* circulates—this is the subtle sign.
Dragons chant, clouds rise, ocean waves surge,
Tigers roar, winds stir, sunlight wanes into dusk.
At this moment, the two essences return as one,
Clouds disperse, winds cease, emptiness turns azure.
The Human Gate is sealed, the Ghost Portal blocked,
A drop of golden essence is thus attained.
In the refining furnace, flames are stoked to forge a sword,
Its edge sharp as ice, its brilliance dazzling.
In wild battles, it wards off peril and pacifies the land,
Severing the Three Corpses and the Six Bandits.
The Three Corpses perish, the Six Bandits vanish,
Merged into a single mass, becoming adamantine.
Transcending the mortal to enter the sacred, emerging from the kalpa,
No longer dwelling in the underworld but ascending to heaven.
At this time, truly joyous,
In the scorching sixth month, white snow flies.
Sated with the finest ambrosia at the celestial feast,
Jade nectar flows ceaselessly from the mouth.
Blood transmutes to white, bones to jade,
The whole body refined to the lightness of a feather.
The numinous embryo nurtured for ten full months,
A breakthrough at the crown—radiance is born.
Neither born nor dead,
Across kalpas to this day, nameless.
One spirit transforms into ten thousand spirits,
Yet it is none other than the Master of Central Yang.

**Song of Realization**
The Master of Realization studied Zhuangzi and Laozi,
Swiftly awakening to the true mechanism, turning back early.
Having received but half a phrase from the immortal teacher,
Iron walls and silver mountains were all toppled.
The ancestral nature, luminous and perfect, is the root,
Neither form nor void.
Piercing gold and stone, emerging from the kalpa,
Still and unmoving, yet responsive when moved.
Thus, in refining the elixir, employ the Mysterious Female,
Tempering mercury and smelting lead to secure the furnace and cauldron.
Within the twelve double-hours, inwardly observe in stillness,
Embracing the myriad phenomena, dwelling in the immortal realm.
When yang arises, swiftly gather it,
Revolving the wind in fusion, wielding the numinous banner.
The Yellow Lad of the sea’s depths embraces the sun as it rises,
The Azure Dragon leaps backward to the Southern *Li*.
The White Tiger is led down from the Golden Gate,
Feathered canopies and radiant essence flow unceasing.
Straight through the Tower of Nine Stories to the Crimson Palace,
A perfect pearl is born, like the bright moon.
The ten directions’ vast phenomena return to celestial might,
Filling the cave and flooding the void with flying white snow.
Ghosts wail, spirits grieve, all traces vanish,
Heaven and earth become a realm of glass.
At this moment, truly joyous,
This is the secret of the Returned Elixir.
The mute tasting honey knows it for himself,
Lucidly, neither birth nor extinction.
The infant nurtured for ten months,
A breakthrough at the crown—heavenly immortals descend.
Three thousand deeds perfected, eight hundred merits complete,
Riding the phoenix, ascending in broad daylight to Penglai.

**Song of the Returned Elixir**
A stranger bestowed upon me the secret of the Returned Elixir,
The ninefold cyclical elixir holds profound meaning.
The Mysterious Pass—a single aperture, the root of heaven and earth,
Forcibly named the Elixir Furnace, called the Reclining Moon.
Neither biased nor partial, precisely centered,
The Eight Trigrams and Five Phases encircle and array.
The immortals point to this as the foundation of the elixir,
Only requiring the primordial spirit to return to the *qi*-cavern.
Spirit and *qi* merge, anchoring the elixir field,
Luminous and void, illuminating the profound and clear.
The four great elements of the body belong to yin,
Yin’s turbidity seizes yang, and yang is not pure.
Descending from root to branch, form is born,
Thus human life bears loss and deficiency.
Know this, cultivate, and attain longevity,
Not knowing it, cultivation follows form to extinction.
Now I teach you the *Song of the Returned Elixir*,
Within its verses, the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.
The opening and closing of heaven and earth is the gate of the *Yi*,
The sun and moon’s cyclic return—its mechanism never ceases.
Observe the Way of Heaven, grasp the movement of Heaven,
You must recognize the winter solstice within the body.
At the winter solstice, yang arises—swiftly gather the lead,
Firmly guard the Three Passes, be resolute and fierce.
Summon the warhorses to return to the stable,
Lock the macaque in chains, allow no laxity.
In the *Li* Palace, the wind of the sacred flute stirs,
Blowing down flames to scorch the sea with heat.
In an instant, the hidden dragon appears in the field,
Thunder crashes, the dragon soars, golden lightning flashes.
The Yellow River’s waves surge through the Gate of Heaven,
Transforming into sweet rain to wash away demonic filth.
The Metal Lord rides the tiger down the western mountain,
Seizing the dragon pearl, his heart alone rejoices.
Return it to the earthen crucible, seal it firmly,
One battle’s success—no need to cling to clumsiness.
The sky, free of floating haze, *qi* clear and bright,
Naturally, the elixir congeals within the crucible.
In the cave, spring warms, the yellow sprout grows,
On the cliff, emptiness clears, white snow flies.
The sacred embryo nurtured for ten months,
Divine water and the flower pool flow unceasing.
Within this subtle principle lies profound mystery,
Soft as silk, hard as iron.
Mortal bones refined into cold jade,
Red blood tempered into white.
Shedding the womb, changing the crucible, emerging from the yin tally,
Shattering the void, the scene of radiance transforms.
The yang spirit’s transformations—vast and luminous,
Alone stepping upon rosy clouds to the Golden Gate.

**Thirty-Six Poems on the Work of Golden Elixir**
*By Hunranzi*

**I**
A single drunkenness sheds the dusty yoke,
Peaches of immortality bloom anew for a thousand years.

**One**
In motion, stillness, sitting, lying—never stray from the center,
When the time comes, spirit knows, intent flows free.
Qi circulates in ceaseless cycles of *sheng* and *gou*,
The Five Phases gather in *zhun* and *meng*.
The Azure Dragon leaps backward into the Mysterious Valley,
The White Tiger is drawn forth into the Crimson Palace.
In an instant, Heaven and Earth unite in embrace,
The Returned Elixir refines, filling the furnace with crimson glow.

**Two**
The Great Dao of Primordial Heaven is fundamentally non-doing,
Yet when *tiankui* arises, one must recognize the moment.
The Five Qi merge—first seal *xun*,
A single yang is drawn forth, then fills *li*.
Vast as falling snow, dissolving kalpas of dust,
The elixir in the crucible congeals, jade branches bloom.
From this point on, only gentle fire is needed,
Empty the heart and hold the Infant daylong.

**Three**
The Celestial Stem turns, the Dipper shifts,
Gathering golden essence into the Field of Destiny.
The *xun* gate’s winds return, opening the sacred key,
The *kun* furnace’s fire blazes, refining silver lead.
The homeland’s spring permeates, the Three Flowers flourish,
The world’s mists disperse, the moon waxes full.
Silent, wordless, ever embracing simplicity,
The Great Sound, boundless, enfolds all mystery.

**Four**
A human life of a hundred years is but a floating bubble,
Do not wait for time to hasten white hairs.
Earth, water, fire, wind—this body is a temporary convergence,
Spirit, essence, soul, and intent must be cultivated.
Seeking Dao through meditation or inquiry—no need for many words,
Erecting the crucible, installing the furnace—do not seek recklessly.
Grasp these subtle signs,
And you will find Penglai here and now.

**Five**
Opening and closing, Heaven and Earth divide a single qi,
Balanced before and after the crescent’s arc.
To refine form, harmonize it with golden liquid,
To subdue the *po*, first quicken the living mercury.
The maiden weds Wood Lord, their love is true,
The child clings to Heavenly Mother, their bond deep.
Concentrate spirit, still breath, ever observe the wondrous,
Within the gourd, a separate spring unfolds.

**Six**
Nine returns, seven reversals refine cinnabar,
Eight flavors blend into one sublime taste.
In the mercury furnace, spring deepens, jade leaves sprout,
In the lead crucible, fire subdues, golden flowers bloom.
Drunk on ghee in the Hall of Eternal Spring,
The moon of wisdom shines beyond kalpas’ abode.
Though Heaven and Earth may perish, my Dao endures,
On Kunlun’s heights, I recline amidst mist and clouds.

**Seven**
The Jade Clarity’s Primordial Beginning gathers the host of immortals,
Ten thousand sages descend upon the millet-grain heaven.
Dragon and Tiger soar high, following the Dipper’s turn,
Phoenix and simurgh dance low, chasing the wind’s whirl.
In an instant, the celebration unfolds in the Primordial Palace,
A single spark of light surpasses the Emperor of Images.
Overjoyed beyond words, the heart delights,
Snow flies in fire across the field of mushrooms.

**Eight**
Within this body lies its own Heaven and Earth,
A single slice divides, yet remains whole.
The Yellow River, ten thousand miles, flows through the earth’s axis,
The Four Seasons’ pure qi connects to the sky’s root.
Dragon’s roar and Tiger’s howl unite in true passion,
Ghosts wail and spirits shriek as flames rage.
Piercing the void, nothing clings,
Who can speak of the secrets within?

**Nine**
The barbarian boy rides the iron ox backward,
His hands ever play the jade flute.
A single aperture awakens the dream of life and death,
Six notes shatter ancient and modern doubts.
On Kunlun’s slopes, spring warms, yellow sprouts grow,
At the *xun* gate, winds soften, white snow hangs.
Who can fathom this song, this melody?
Only Heaven knows the heart’s truth.

**Ten**
Wind sweeps away the last clouds, the jade firmament clears,
Moon bright, autumn waters—great elixir congeals.
Responding to circumstances without attachment,
Penetrating earth, piercing heaven—this is the supreme vehicle.
The Dao pervades the Three Powers, only the Old Master knows,
The lamp is passed through six generations, Lu possesses the skill.
A nod of understanding grasps the principle of firmness,
What need for many words on Ge and Teng?

**Eleven**
Within the body, the winter solstice stirs flying ashes,
At sea, spring follows the Dipper’s handle’s return.
A single breath circles the heavens, dividing *zi* and *wu*,
Fire rises at the Three Passes, shaking wind and thunder.
In the Jade Field, mushrooms sprout in misty beauty,
In the Golden Valley, peaches of immortality bloom with dew.
Ever drunk on ghee, ever inebriated,
Rosy light pierces straight through the crown.

**Twelve**
The Spirit Abyss is still, merging with profound darkness,
The Golden Mother’s flying wheel emerges from the jade gate.
Straight to the *li* palace to seek the Radiant Maiden,
Returning to the *kun* chamber, relying on Heavenly Soldiers.
In an instant, a millet grain forms the mysterious image,
Ten thousand miles of rivers and lakes enter the pure vase.
If you ask the true meaning within,
White clouds seal the verdant peaks in silence.

**Thirteen**
One gives rise to two, two to three,
All phenomena return to a single grain.
In stillness, observe without self,
Within, only the empty hermitage is seen.
Neither near nor far, neither high nor low,
Neither west nor east, neither north nor south.
When the season arrives, the melon ripens of itself,
Wind clear, moon bright—Xiangtan is full.

**Fourteen**
Lower the screen, seal the gates, guard the true interval,
Fill the belly, empty the heart, refine the Great Return.

**Fifteen**
In a single moment’s effort, one returns to the root,
Three medicines conjoin to form the elixir.
The red furnace melts snow, wind clears the bones,
The dark valley revives in spring, wine flushes the face.
Joyous, carefree, worldly worries forgotten,
Ever has the benevolent one loved dwelling by the mountains.

**Sixteen**
A speck of primordial creative essence,
Born first from the original qi.
Five phases, four images—all issue from this,
Eight trigrams, three powers—together they merge.
The wise refine it, and a golden Buddha appears,
The deluded lose it, and their jade mountain collapses.
Who knows that false actions end in illusion?
In the end, turning back is the Great Clarity.

**Seventeen**
The Gate of Heaven opens and closes, west and east,
Spirit and qi generate each other, transforming blockage into passage.
The Mysterious Maiden plays her flute to summon the colored phoenix,
The Yellow Lad embraces the sun, riding the Azure Dragon.
Three flowers flourish, clustering in the golden crucible,
Myriad forms array themselves, gleaming in the azure void.
Without stepping beyond the courtyard, one knows the great transformation—
Heaven and Earth all belong to the master within.

**Eighteen**
To gather lead, one must gather true lead;
If one gathers common lead, it is but partial.
Facing circumstances to set up the furnace is all false,
Swallowing mist and ingesting qi is also in vain.
Tiger and dragon are subdued only by nature,
Raven and hare are captured without force.
If you can fathom this deeply,
Then you may truly learn to be an immortal.

**Nineteen**
Vast and indistinct, the Dao is all-pervading,
How could the reckless words of ordinary men fathom it?
Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, there was no *jiazi*,
Yet the infant’s first cry already held heaven and earth.
The fire dragon chases south as the mud ox flees,
The metal tiger follows west as the iron horse gallops.
Grasp the mechanism of inversion and reversal,
And what fear remains of not transcending the root of life and death?

**Twenty**
Each time yang arises to gather the medicine,
Gently apply the fire, kindling from peril.
Within, revolve it by the upright *gang*,
Without, circulate it by the moving Dipper.
At midnight, the Metal Duke pays court at the Jade Palace,
The immortals of the Ten Isles gather at the Jasper Pool.
After drinking the *tihu* nectar, ever inebriated,
One beholds the void and the Dao may be attained.

**Twenty-One**
The great path of immortal cultivation is not hard to seek,
Yet its subtle mechanism holds profound principles.
If in dreams you know it is a dream,
Then you understand there is no heart beyond the heart.
Spirit returns to the sea of qi, replenishing true mercury,
Fire arises in the *kun* furnace, refining turbid yin.
When name is achieved and merit complete, withdraw and guard,
Naturally, in obscurity, even ghosts and spirits revere.

**Twenty-Two**
The lesser hermit hides in mountains, the greater in the world,
Wherever one goes, joy is found in nature.
The great sound resides within the soundless,
The wondrous form ever precedes the formed.
In stillness, the millet-pearl conceals the cosmos,
In motion, thunder and lightning shake mountains and rivers.
From this, ghosts and spirits ever offer protection,
Each month, within the gourd, another heaven unfolds.

**Twenty-Three**
Men deem immortals and transcendents as heresy,
Yet who has learned the way of Chen Tuan?
Three great medicines gathered in leisure,
A single luminous pearl beheld in stillness.
Reclining high on white clouds, mountains as pillow,
Voicelessly singing to the azure vault, phoenix bells chime.
Entering and exiting Hua Xu, spirit finds no trace,
Within the gourd, heaven and earth are vast.

**Twenty-Four**
Spirit abides in the subtle and formless, roaming the azure void,
At the sea gate, the great crimson first appears.
Fire rises from the *weilü*, piercing the three passes,
Feathered canopy flows with essence, a single channel unites.
The Red Child rides the dragon back to the crimson palace,
The Yellow Matron leads the bride to wed the Metal Duke.
Refining the returning wind, the numinous embryo’s qi,
Lifespan becomes boundless, one with heaven and earth.

**Twenty-Five**
The great Dao’s non-action holds profound principles,
Effort must be sought in stillness.
The hen brooding her chicks ever retains intent,
The horse born in the wild must swiftly be restrained.
Water mirror, sky clear—waves shimmer,
Thunder city, moon pale—night deepens.
A furnace’s unceasing warmth,
Refines the divine elixir, filling the crucible with gold.

**Twenty-Six**
The Dao relies on the Mysterious Female to establish its root,
To advance the fire, first rise with the Dipper’s peril.
With both hands seize the raven and hare,
Wait but a moment to drive the tiger and dragon.
Suddenly encountering a fine scene in the empty sky,
It is precisely the mid-autumn moon at its fullest.
I alone love the distinct flavor of the southwest wind,
As mountains, rivers, and the great earth become glass.

**Twenty-Seven**

**Twenty-Eight**
The Dao resides in the Primordial One, yet it is nothing at all,
From the One and Earth, the work of cultivation unfolds.
Wind and thunder stir, molten gold and lightning surge,
Wood and fire steam, raising the jade crucible.
Forth comes the luminous pearl, congealing like a grain of millet,
Refined true qi fills the gourd of Penglai.
When the time arrives, all barriers shatter,
Radiance reveals itself, round and solitary—a precious fragment.

**Twenty-Nine**
The man of great vessel possesses a nature firm and true,
With a pure heart and few desires, his authenticity remains whole.
Fan Zhongyan, studying the *Yi*, could deceive even ghosts,
Yang Zhen returned the gold, never concealing from Heaven.
Facing circumstances, he sits in meditation, forgetting self and other,
Adapting to conditions, he harmonizes with square and circle.
At ease and free, unbound by constraints,
He is but a carefree immortal of Penglai.

**Thirty**
A hair’s breadth holds the vast emptiness,
Myriad images arrayed within this very space.
Awakened nature is perfectly round, neither within nor without,
The Dharma-body’s numinous response manifests in azure and crimson.
The Jasper Pool’s wine is ever-present for drinking,
The Dao of Heaven speaks not, yet resonance pervades all.
Whoever penetrates this mystery,
Sits majestically atop the wondrous peak.

**Thirty-One**
Three thousand six hundred heterodox arts,
Misguided seekers cling to them in vain pursuit.
Transmuting stones, transforming thatch—all delusion,
Abandoning wives, fasting—crude cultivation.
How much better to turn things until emotions dissolve into stillness,
Then the celestial waters flow in reverse.
Where is that single point of luminosity seen?
Osmanthus flowers and bright moon fill the tower’s heights.

**Thirty-Two**
My home lies before the handle of the Dipper’s Ladle,
Green Dragon and White Tiger coil in dual rotation.
Three medicines compose the Three Treasures,
A moment’s work seizes a year’s harvest.
The golden crucible’s fire warms, lead buds blossom,
The jade furnace’s broth steams, mercury pearls round.
The numinous embryo nurtured, the true person emerges,
Shattering the void to ascend the nine heavens.

**Thirty-Three**
The *Great Change*’s profundity never leaves the body,
Its mechanism moves with dawn and dusk in harmony.
At midnight, the bowels stir—first draw from Kan,
In the fifth month, yin retreats—next halt at Kun.
Fire refines the jewel, its light outshines the moon,
Elixir congeals in the golden crucible, qi births clouds.
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled,
One transcends the three realms,
Striding alone up jasper steps to meet the Lord of Heaven.

**Thirty-Four**
Within the body lies the Moon’s Grotto and Heaven’s Root,
From nothing arises being, from being arises nothing.
Kan and Li unite, suspending the embryo crucible,
Heaven and Earth merge, concealing the millet pearl.
Five thousand words expound the *Dao* and *Virtue*,
Three hundred verses transmit the *Yin Convergence*.
If disciples seek the meaning within,
All is contained in Zhou Dunyi’s *Taiji Diagram*.

**Thirty-Five**
The Dao lies in the three before and the three after,
Its profundity forbids vulgar minds to fathom.
The Five Phases invert, the Three Passes turn,
Myriad qi converge in a single aperture.
Stars encircle the Purple Tenuity, all bow to the North,
Heaven opens the Yellow Path, straight to the South.
Who among the wise of past and present first grasped it?
The myriad sages and thousand perfected yield to Lao Dan.

**Thirty-Six**
Beneath the Nine Palaces Mountain is my home,
I come and go ever riding the white deer carriage.
Gathering herbs at will, I ascend the Purple Court,
Preserving spirit all day, I refine cinnabar.
The Flowery Pond’s fragrance permeates the flowing golden liquid,
The iron tree revives in spring, spitting jade blossoms.
In the tenth month, the embryo sheds its form, the whole body revealed,
Phoenix soars and simurgh dances, riding clouds and rosy mists.

Hold fast to the One, and the Dao spontaneously arises,
You must await the bright noon to strike the third watch.

Stars wheel through the celestial sphere, the Dipper’s handle lies horizontal.

The lead furnace congeals cinnabar, mercury blossoms gleam.
Though the void be shattered, nothing is truly attained—
Yet heaven’s immortals record your name.

When the ten-month embryo matures, spirit transforms of itself,
Roaming the clouds’ edge, the Dao knows no bounds.

Can bear a child in a single year.
Each one emerges riding a white crane,
Each dawn returns to recline in the Spirit Terrace.
Ever attended by Earth Mother’s sustaining power,
Heaven’s kitchen sends offerings unbidden.
Not that my school inverts the natural order—
The Gate of Nature opens atop the crown.

**Fifth**
My school’s supreme Dao is fundamentally non-doing,
In the white-snow pot, Kan and Li are paired.
Often I drink three cups of the wine of idleness,
Now and then I play a few moves of the game of no contest.
Veiling my light, I silently preserve the true body,
Regulating breath, I continuously restore the foundation of life.
Mastering these two wondrous applications,
At last you ascend the ladder to heaven.

**Sixth**
The immortals’ oral instructions are few in words,
A single phrase from the vast immortal canon suffices.
The Primal Beginning suspends the pearl to enact great transformation,
Vajra pushes the Dipper to revolve the celestial sphere.
First, the swift steed gallops to open the Yellow Path,
Next, the Flowery Pond is rinsed to moisten the Crimson Field.
When the Xun-gate’s wind rises, the golden tiger roars,
The whole body’s myriad qi together attain immortality.

Seal the upper pass, open the lower pass,
Revealing the eastern pool’s rosy dawn.

Slowly it ascends to the upper Li Palace.

This is the true oral instruction for returning cinnabar—
Form and spirit both perfected, you witness the immortal school.

The supreme Dao of returning cinnabar is fundamentally wordless,
Its wonder lies in moving post-heavenly after pre-heavenly.
When the two qi merge, first rectify nature,
At the stirring of the one Yang, swiftly withdraw lead.

From this, great peace is established under heaven,
On the Terrace of Luxuriant Clouds, you play with the moon’s beauty.

**Oral Instructions for Long Zhengzhong**
The empty valley’s sound transmits the midnight bell,
The golden crow flies forth as sea and sky redden.

The crucible transforms, the furnace empties, white snow flies.
Unceasingly reflect inward with unbroken effort,
Naturally, within the body, you behold radiance.

**For Cai Liaokong**
Awakening to true emptiness is the fundamental teaching,
The message of true emptiness is fundamentally not empty.
The dragon returns to the great sea, clouds first gather,
The □ howls on the cold crag, the moon stands at full.
The wisdom eye clearly perceives the formless realm,
The Dharma-body eternally abides in Potala Palace.
Thus perceiving the primordial self,
A single point of light endures through ancient ages.

**Seeing Daoist Zou Qiuyun Off to Reside on Turtle Mountain**
In yellow cap and rustic robes, his countenance like a youth’s,
He returns to dwell on Turtle Mountain’s foremost peak.
Drunk, he blows his iron flute beneath the forest moon,
His jade book summons the dragon from the cave.
Reigniting the golden crucible’s fire to refine cinnabar,
He plants pines by the stone stream to call back the cranes.
Though parted, our bodies may be a thousand leagues apart,
Our hearts should meet as yours.

**For Yiyangzi**
Within the mysterious pass’s aperture, the Dao contains truth,
Applying the celestial mechanism lies in a single ascent.
The moon shines on the mountain peak, the golden tiger roars,
Thunder shakes the sea’s depths, the fire dragon ascends.

Dragon and tiger rage, employing death to capture.
In a moment of fusion, cinnabar congeals of itself,
A breeze in fair weather, a moon after rain fill the jade forest.

**For Quanzhen Daoist Li Siddao**
Great and small, dark passions reside in one body,
On the Jasper Terrace, the Primal Beginning hangs the sun-pearl.
The Kun crucible revolves, the flying Golden Mother,
Brahma-qi swirls, structuring the jade book.
The moon shines on sea and sky, autumn waters vast,
Clouds withdraw from the stone chamber, intent is thus.
The immortal capital has long known your name,
Phoenix and crane come to welcome you to walk the Great Void.

**Letter to Gong Wuzhen on Advancing Daoist Practice**
To understand the human heart is to understand the Dao-heart,
The Dao-heart must be sought within the wondrous.
Add medicine to the Qian crucible, lead dissolves mercury,
Refine with fire in the Kun furnace, stone transforms to gold.
Eight poles’ winds clear, the cliff tiger roars,
A thousand rivers’ moons brighten, the sea dragon sings.
When the jade zither’s *Equalizing Heaven* is played to its end,
It scatters as the *Yang Spring*’s sound beyond things.

**Inner Pointers on Talisman-Fire for Huang Shouzhong**
The Primal Beginning’s bright pearl hangs five fathoms high,

The spirit furnace silently stills, tiger and dragon sleep.
Thus unmoving, the true message,
Great wisdom perfectly pervades, preceding the Lord of Images.

**For Lanranzi**
The lazy old man reclines on the White Cloud Terrace,
When one aperture opens, ten thousand apertures open.
Eight-cornered rays of light float like jade script,
The Three Flowers gather in the crucible, congealing the golden embryo.

With rod in hand, one may angle for the carp in one’s cup;
With a flick of the finger, one can summon thunder in the palm.
All things clearly transcended, nothing clings—
Wherever the idle body wanders is Penglai.

**For Wu Yungu**
A single qi, purely Yang, the Dao is naturally noble;
The Dharma-body appears everywhere, revealing the Perfect Real.
The precious pearl’s radiance enfolds heaven and earth,
The iron flute’s notes move ghosts and gods to tears.
Drunk, he often uses mountains as his pillow;
Roaming freely, he always keeps the moon as his neighbor.
When in future years his practice is complete, he will ascend to the Primal Beginning,
Treading red clouds to reach the Jade Emperor’s court.

**Instructing Hunxuanzi on the Esoteric Pointers of Inner Refinement**
How to return to the root and revert to the origin?
Gently warm the crucible and furnace to refine the golden waves.
As stars shift and the Dipper turns, the immortal embryo dances;
Tigers roar and dragons chant, the Stone Maiden sings.
Purple qi rises high above the Mysterious Valley’s peak,
Cinnabar light fills the White Cloud Nest.
There is no need to seek the true realm in the human world—
This very body and mind are the Great Luo.

Drawing lead and adding mercury, the principle subtly flows;
In the golden crucible, the elixir congeals in an instant.
Breath settled, perfectly still, the fire is evenly applied;
Heaven revolves in silence, never departing the center.

The Jasper Terrace and Purple Palace flourish without end.

The Silver River’s stars shift, the Dipper’s handle turns.
One’s nature shines, transcending beyond things—
Floating clouds do not cling to the azure sky.

**Ten Poems Harmonizing with Bamboo Spring Recluse’s Rhymes on Cultivating the Real**

**I**
In a humble lane, with bamboo basket and gourd, delighting in spontaneity,
The heavenly mind is one, its principle profound and mysterious.
The *Yi*’s practice has form, following Fuxi’s reign;
Nature awakens to non-arising before the Supreme Ultimate.
Brahma’s qi circulates with the sun along the ecliptic,
The lamp of wisdom ever illuminates the Crimson Bright Heaven.
Originally not following the turning of empty space,
Why seek floating fame to stain illusory bonds?

**II**
The Valley Spirit does not die, the Dao is at ease;
Responding to change without fixed method, the body is naturally mysterious.
The divine eye clearly observes beyond kalpas of dust,
The Dipper’s handle ever stands before the Northern Asterism.

Jade script’s radiance floats in the five-fathom heaven.
The myriad dharmas originally have no fixed thought—
Blending light with the world, simply follow conditions.

**III**
Those who delight in the Dao are naturally at ease,
With a single breath of dark emotion, merging into the profound.
The numinous real returns its chariot within emptiness,
Maidens of radiance hold flowers, scattering them before the seat.
The sword’s sweep emits light, piercing the Northern Dipper;
The flute’s notes, though without holes, resound in the Celestial Harmony.
When merit is complete and fame achieved, one should withdraw—
All things accord with others, following worldly conditions.

**IV**
The prince seeking immortality, his nature bright and clear,
In the numinous terrace’s silence, awakens to the profound mystery.
Yang is drawn from Kan to fill within Li;
The Crow Mother flies and alights before the grotto.
The elixir revolves through nine returns, gold fills the crucible;
The spirit settles, myriad thoughts like water embracing heaven.
When shall I too cast off worldly dust?
I would also follow the master to forge a bond with the Dao.

**V**
The Old Lord discoursed on Dao and virtue, luminously clear;
The ninety-nine numinous verses, each character profound.
The ancestral qi transformed and gave birth after the Primal Beginning;
The divine mechanism wondrously appeared before the Grand Purity.
Long he dwelt beneath the pillar as the Zhou’s historian,
Far he crossed the Pamirs to imprint the Buddha’s heaven.
If one can penetrate this,
Why need one be mired in worldly bonds?

**VI**
The Tathāgata’s countenance is originally majestic—
It is not by seeking mystery elsewhere that one finds mystery.
A single point of empty numinosity transcends beyond things;
A thousand heads of wondrous awakening stand before the moment.
Ice melts and reverts to water as before;
The moon sets, yet clearly does not leave the sky.
I send this word to later students of the path:
Strive to form good bonds in the Dharma assembly.

**VII**
The Master’s writings alone shine brilliantly,
In the *Doctrine of the Mean* and *Great Learning*, revealing subtle mysteries.
All governance emerges from the *River Chart*;
The *Heart Yi* ever abides before the hexagrams.
Anxious for the Dao, he often pondered matters after his death;
Abiding in benevolence, he never left the heaven of nature.
When Old Cong saw him, he sighed like a dragon,
Inquiring about rites, he still sought the path beyond.

**VIII**
Wandering beyond things, his interest carefree,
Three returns of the *Yinfu* refine the plain mystery.
Treading the Dipper, he often ascends the Golden Gate;
Soaring in spirit, he ever pays homage before the Jade Emperor.
A stream swells with snow, spring returns to the valley;
A myriad miles of clouds part, the moon fills the sky.
Who can grasp this wonder, this feeling?
Only the Yellow Dame understands the bond within.

**IX**
The immortal’s Dao of purity and emptiness is no accident—
One must awaken to the real from the heart.
All radiance lies within dark emotion;
How can ghosts and demons know the nature of awareness?
In the third winter of the Northern Sea, thunder shakes the earth;
In the sixth month of the Southern Palace, snow blankets the sky.
Wherever the idle body wanders is the road to Yingzhou—
Spiritual transformation is boundless, responding to myriad conditions.

**X**
Sitting motionless all day, inwardly merged,
The river chariot moves, precisely in the central mystery.
Two streams of pure qi surge upward to heaven;
A thousand-foot flying spring cascades before the ravine.
Manifestation does not follow other realms;
Attaining the real lies only within one’s own heaven.
Worldly people point and call it a vain affair,
Laughing at my wind-madness in learning the bond of stillness.

**For Wu Deying, by Zhi’an**
Washing his ears among the clouds, delighting in the sound of springs,
An empty mind does not follow the shifting of illusory emotions.
The medicine furnace’s elixir is ripe, yet fire is still kept;
A grain of millet hangs in emptiness, revealing another heaven.
The marks of ten thousand waters recede as the wind subsides;
The shadows of a thousand peaks fall as the moon becomes full.
With a single gourd and a single bamboo hat, delighting in the moment—
Why seek immortality in Penglai?

**For Daoist Guo of Wudang Palace, by Fuyuan**
Once in Yecheng he met the immortal who planted peaches,
Alone receiving the esoteric transmission of the *Yellow Court*.
Eating wood, he sought no matters beyond the body;
In the medicine furnace, he ever refined the lead within fire.
The Three Fields warm in spring, jade-like clouds arise;
A myriad waters gleam cold, the moon rests in the sky.
All is understood, all is known, nothing clings—
Wandering as an immortal, the crane’s wings gracefully soar.

Where the moon sinks into cold depths and the Dipper’s handle dips low.

As deep night’s moon fills the empty mountains.
Seated in oblivion, unaware—pure as water,
A thousand miles of autumn sky, a single expanse of tranquility.

The Dipper’s handle turns, the Celestial Pivot shifts,
Yang is drawn from Kan to mend the southern Li.
When the Qian adept returns from gathering the medicine,
Only the sky’s light bathes the azure pool.

In the stone chamber, smoke is swallowed; the Xun gate seals,
The Dipper’s handle held inverted, facing south.
The mountain’s scene differs from the mundane world—
In the sixth month, blossoms fly like cold white snow.

**XI**
The numinous raft drifts on the tides of the sea,
A whirlwind carries it ten thousand miles to the azure vault.
The Azure Dragon is captured and reared in the Yellow House,
Its luminous pearl seized and fired within flame.

**XII**
Lodging in Chang’e’s lofty lunar palace,
Amid the fragrant osmanthus, autumn’s hairs are counted.
Three hundred and sixty degrees of the celestial circuit—
Half an hour’s time to traverse them all.

**XIII**

At the ocean’s depths, the mud ox transforms into a fire ox,
The Yellow Lad inverts his stride to mount Kunqiu.
A flute plays one tune, returning late—
Moonlit white, mountain green, autumn’s same hue.

**XIV**
Silent and continuous, guarding the Great Void,
Walking or sitting, never leaving its stream.
When the work of returning to the origin is complete,
A mani pearl is nurtured forth.

**XV**
Within Kan, one stroke is true lead;
Drawn forth to mend Li’s palace, remaking Qian.
The talismanic fire returns to Kun’s crucible,
The numinous script gleams with fresh crimson radiance.

**XVI**
Within the gourd, Kan and Li are ever paired,
One’s own landscape is known to oneself alone.
As the waning year meets the new spring’s arrival,
Once more the original Jiazi is reckoned.

**XVII**
Empty the heart, still the will, silently lower the screen,
Not a single thread of emptiness is permitted.
When the myriad things arise, observe their return and transformation,
The Five Phases invert and revolve in ebb and flow.

**XVIII**
To refine the adamantine, indestructible body,
Three kinds of medicinal substances must be wholly true.
In one furnace, water and fire refine and boil them,
Then one becomes a person atop Penglai’s peak.

**XIX**
At the stirring of the first yang, gather true lead,
Turn the celestial mechanism—the Dipper spins of itself.
Thrice advance, thrice retreat, with vigorous force,
The whole body ignites in flames that scorch the sky.

**XX**
The Herdboy drives ten thousand miles across the Dark Gully,
The path is thick with yellow blossoms and purple mist.
The Weaver Girl invites him to cross the river,
Within the gourd lies yet another storied pavilion.

**XXI**
The hornless ox treads upon purple clouds,
At the ridge’s crest, it harnesses the Peaceful Cart.
Seeking the truth, it enters the Western Pool,
Gazing upon a thousand peach trees in bloom.

**XXII**
Of the union of Li and Kan, to whom may it be told?
One’s own message is known to oneself alone.
Having wandered the ends of the earth without other affairs,
One returns to the divine mountain to cultivate purple lingzhi.

**XXIII**
Over the sea, one has already ridden the yellow crane away,
From the moon, the rabbit is seized and brought forth.
The celestial wind blows me back to Peng Island,
Ten thousand golden lotuses bloom in a single night.

**XXIV**
The Mysterious Pass’s aperture is originally formless,
Yet birth as buddha or immortal is but a forced name.
With intent settled and unchanging, practice the two eights,
The great sound of boundless measure is the rare tone.

**XXV**
There is a thing formed before heaven and earth,
Lofty and independent, transcending all.
The Crimson Chart unfurls, illuminating the Three Luminaries,
In the Dragon Han’s spring, the Jiazi year returns.

**XXVI**
At midnight, the Wooden Lad roams the eastern sea,
A wheel of fire rises, riding the dragon in reverse.
After paying court to the Southern Emperor,
One sits and watches celestial blossoms, no Xun wind stirring.

**XXVII**
Behind closed doors, in pure stillness, recite the *Nanhua*,
The Dragon Maiden, floating, drives a chariot of colors.
Gracefully, she descends through the pearl-gate,
A wisdom wind scatters the clouds of dawn.

**XXVIII**
The Metal Lord rides a qilin from the ocean’s depths,
Mounting Kunlun, treading upon purple clouds.
By the Vermilion Sparrow Bridge, he meets the Alchemical Maiden,
Returning together to pay homage to the Peaceful Lord.

**XXIX**
At the first crow of the golden rooster, when Gui is born,
The Dipper turns, the Silver River shifts in order.
From the Yin position it begins, to the Shen position it ends,
The returning wind blends all, forming the foundation of the elixir.

**XXX**
Wholly essence, wholly qi, and wholly spirit,
This is the indestructible body of cultivation.
If one attains the true fire’s crucible,
One roams the Three Realms and enters the Golden Gate.

**XXXI**
In the lead furnace, the Great Elixir is nurtured and congeals,
Between the crescents, before and after, the two eights pause.
From this point, there is no need to tend the fire’s timing,
At Qujiang’s heights, one delights in the verdant mountains.

**XXXII**
The Green Lad and White Maiden, each to the west and east,
Rely wholly on the Yellow Matron to unite their work.
Once led back to the grotto’s abode,
Cloudy passion and rainy intent are most harmonious.

**XXXIII**
The two eights of vajra mount the fire wheel,
The Yellow River inverts and pours down Kunlun.
With a single stroke of the wisdom blade, emptiness is split,
The Three Corpses and Six Thieves’ souls are annihilated.

**XXXIV**
The Golden Elixir’s great medicine is not hard to know,
Spirit descends to fumigate, qi ascends to shift.
Most wondrous is this singular marvel—
The mountain-burning talisman seizes the celestial mechanism.

**XXXV**
An extraordinary person imparts to me the returning elixir’s secret,
Returning to Dan Mountain to test and refine it.
In a single breath, dragon and tiger contend,
Thunder and lightning shake the celestial gates of the nine skies.

**XXXVI**
To cultivate the truth, first refine body and mind,
A segment of celestial mechanism, profound in wondrous principle.
Turn these hinges of the pass,
Yellow mud and black stone transform into gold.

**XXXVII**
Upon the mountain’s rise, gather the medicinal sprouts,
Fire concealed in earth, burning within water.
In ebb and flow, take care to guard,
As if crossing a single-log bridge over a precipice.

**XXXVIII**
In learning immortality, do not pursue empty nothingness,
True mercury and true lead are the original lineage.
Wu earth flows forth, Ji earth receives,
Refined into a mass of purple-golden red.

**XXXIX**
Disciples all recite the oral chan,
Yet when asked of true chan, they fall silent.
How could they know my true creation?
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

**XL**
The furnace bellows fan the wind, fire reddens of itself,
The earthen cauldron’s broth boils, waves churn the void.
Raven’s liver and hare’s marrow are simmered together,
Refining the numinous elixir in a single breath’s work.

**XLI**
My great Dao is originally without marvel,
Before the bamboo-striking cliff, the black turtle is summoned.
Fire compels metal to move, inverting and turning,
A single tiger’s roar, snowflakes fly.

**XLII**
To gather lead, one must align with the celestial mechanism,
Attend carefully to essence’s ascent, step by step.
Wu and Ji return to the origin, Geng and Jia unite,
The Metal Lord embraces the Jade Toad and returns.

**XLIII**
Refine essence into qi, qi into spirit,
Spirit and qi harmonize as child and mother.
The more it is refined, the firmer the elixir ripens,
Each time it is raised, it is renewed.

**XLIV**
The Magpie Bridge’s reflection in the crimson sunset,
The Three Passes along the spine open a single path.
Mastering the two true wondrous uses,
Externally gathering medicine, internally achieving fusion.

**XLV**
External medicine employs great transformation,
The internal elixir’s nurturing requires no action.
When the time comes, a silent return conveys the message,
The footless lad inverts and ascends the ladder.

**XLVI**
There are those deluded who falsely transmit,
Sealing essence, lewd women, and drawing lead.
If this is called the elixir’s medicine,
It would make the immortals of the Great Brahma Heaven laugh.

**XLVII**
The Dao does not depart from the heart—Gui is lead,
To gather lead, first secure the central field.
The original spirit often turns through the Three Passes,
Drawing the host of perfected beings into the grotto heaven.

**XLVIII**
Within the grotto’s pure and void qi, the golden embryo takes form,
Nurturing the numinous root to raise the perfected child.
After ten months, the embryo sheds—spirit transforms of itself,
Atop the crown, a thunderous crack bursts forth with a single sound.

**XLIX**
The original spirit is the true master of the house,
In an instant, it harmonizes yin and yang.
The ten poles’ flying perfected ones join their strength,
All come to chew the void in a single mouthful.

**L**
The single nature, perfectly penetrating, is already complete—
Why spend all day painfully poring over scriptures?
Every sutra merely opens the path to awakening,
Only teaching all beings not to dull their numinous essence.

**LI**
Those of the Dao secure their root and origin,
The upper pass stirs, the lower pass opens.
To know where heaven and earth find their dwelling,
All lies within the wordless, silent return.

**LII**
The front pass is deeply sealed, the rear pass opens wide,
Pine winds from ten thousand valleys surge through the crown.
Fire blazes, smoke soars, the golden crucible splits—
The brocade-maned lion roars with the thunder of spring.

**LIII**
A pearl the size of a millet grain hangs at the center,
Its light descending from earth, five *zhang* in length.
Advancing fire, withdrawing tally—the heavens turn left,
Dragon essence and phoenix marrow transform into the mysterious yellow.

**LIV**
In cultivating the true, first take nature as the foundation,
Only upon seeing nature does one begin the work of refining life.
Know the time for medicinal substances, diligently gather them,
Naturally, spirit and qi merge into profound unity.

**LV**
Within the crescent-moon furnace, the great return is refined,
The five phases mutually overcome one another to form the elixir.
Half a watch’s journey brings one to the path home—
Tiger’s roar and dragon’s cry are of another kind.

**LVI**
The five thieves assail the heart, creating obstacles,
One must fiercely and resolutely stabilize the central plain.
From of old, the immortal’s Dao has no many methods—
Shattering the void requires but a single fist.

**LVII**
Wood and metal stand apart—tiger and dragon race,
Advancing fire begins with the first line, then follows in order.
The mute man bites his tongue at the third watch,
Few know the flavor within.

**LVIII**
My home lies in the southwest, originally Kun,
Behind, a path leads through to Kunlun.

**LIX**
The divine water of the Flowery Pond is poured in ceaseless streams,
Cultivating golden blossoms that birth purple clouds.

**LX**
Without a master’s transmission, do not sit in meditation—
Even a heart turned to ash or wood withers in vain.
Who knows the secret of talismanic fire and the returning elixir?
A single moment’s turning of the mechanism spins a year.

**LXI**
To forge the illusory body of floating life into strength,
The initial foundation of effort is the root.
Only when cinnabar is refined to ripeness in the golden furnace
Is one permitted to abide in non-action and guard the natural.

**LXII**
The maiden and the infant are but metaphors,
The Yellow Dame too is but a figment of intent.
The true message pierces mountains and penetrates stone—
Without stepping beyond the gate, one knows all things.

**LXIII**
Mouth-bound samadhi needs no discussion,
For lofty discourse shuts the door on itself.
Even if words flow swiftly, the heart remains unenlightened—
In the end, one merely toys with essence and spirit.

**LXIV**
Unversed in scriptures, unconcerned with Chan,
One simply revolves the three natures through the three fields.
When the elixir of immortality is refined in the jade furnace,
One becomes a minor immortal of Penglai.

**LXV**
The celestial mechanism is not distant, the medicine not remote—
Stir the celestial pivot, and earth responds like the tide.
A single breath of dark sincerity ascends the great Dao,
The numinous elixir congeals, forged within the fire.

**LXVI**
The immortal’s Dao is most simple, most easy,
Yet rare to encounter, rare to hear even half a word.
If one receives the true master’s oral transmission,
"My life is in my hands, not heaven’s."

**LXVII**
The bellows’ gate opens, the wind of Xun stirs,
From the deep pool emerges a crimson wheel.
Lifting one’s gaze, the path to the azure heavens lies near—
Alone, one carries the golden toad into the jade palace.

**LXVIII**
The primordial beginning hangs suspended like a millet-grain pearl,
Its flowing light enters the sea to form a golden scripture.
The numinous and true ascend, floating through the void,
All sages gather to convene at the jade pivot.

**LXIX**
Seizing the tiger and capturing the dragon into the jade flask,
The Dao’s loftiness naturally draws the aid of ghosts and spirits.
One need not distinguish self from others—
To transcend death and surpass life is the mark of a true man.

**LXX**
The path ahead is short, the path behind is long,
Straight up the capital mountain, one meets the Jade Emperor.
After feasting in the Jasper Pool, returning to the grotto palace,
One is bestowed a name and appointed Lord of Thunder.

**LXXI**
When fierce demons and specters suddenly deceive,
They repeatedly lead one into illusion and delusion.
With a single flourish of the fire-pen, golden lightning strikes—
The ten directions and three realms all submit.

**LXXII**
At times, one joins the assembly of immortals in the nine palaces,
Riding a jade-green chariot drawn by flying dragons in the cinnabar clouds.
The primordial spirit turns back beneath the capital mountain—
A single moon hangs above the terrace, illuminating the azure sky.

**LXXIII**
Do not dismiss the elixir’s refinement as empty words—
A day’s work makes a day’s immortal.
If one further aids others and upholds sagely transformation,
What worry is there that this body will not ascend to heaven?

**LXXIV**
With fierce awakening and steadfast resolve, one sees the truth intimately,
The *Yinfu* returns thrice to refine form and spirit.
Circulating once, the void shatters—
A thousand miles without clouds, the moon’s light renewed.

**LXXV**
The four seas are at peace, the nation is naturally secure,
When one ruler embodies the Dao, ten thousand ministers stand in awe.
At such a time, only civil influence is needed—
Why resort to arms and subdue the barbarians?

**LXXVI**
The path between heaven and earth is not remote—
Riding a deer in the Dark Capital, one ascends the azure heavens.
The phoenix flute’s melody enters the Palace of Heng’e,
A myriad measures of pure fragrance, osmanthus seeds drift.

**LXXVII**
A single silence, a turn of inner light—all phenomena dissolve,
Unknowing, one dwells in the crystal palace.
The message within holds no excess—
Piercing stone and traversing mountains, every path is open.

**LXXVIII**
The immortal’s wondrous secret is not lightly spoken,
Only those of steadfast faith are entrusted with its transmission.
Once these distinctions are made clear,
With every step, the cart remains beneath heaven.

**LXXIX**
Sage after sage transmits but a single heart,
One who receives this heart’s transmission is a true kindred spirit.
Though one peruses all books, no trace remains—
Yet one penetrates earth and sky, shining through the ages.

**LXXX**
Ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures point to the mysterious chapter,
Each line compels one to seek its profundity.
If one is willing to delve deeply into its core,
Which household’s gate will not face heaven?

**LXXXI**
When the elixir is perfected through nine revolutions, one naturally surpasses the multitude,
With merit complete and the path fulfilled, one moves the Emperor of Heaven.
A single imperial edict descends in broad daylight—
The body soars in purple mist to pay homage at the golden gate.

*Nineteen Songs of Wandering Immortals*

**II**
With lute in sack, I wander far to Wu-yi’s range,
Crossing Slow Pavilion Peak’s high crest.
A single note from iron flute pierces the bright moon,
As pine winds rise—autumn sweeps ten thousand hills.

**III**
A barefoot, tousled, carefree immortal,
Clad in hemp robe, bamboo staff, and cloth-bound feet.
Today I chance through Zhongling’s market,
Laughing as I clap shoulders with Hong Ya.

**IV**
You mock my journey through Chu’s mountains,
Yet jade grass and coral blooms stir endless delight.
The dharma drum still beats at midnight,
As the golden crow soars—crimson floods sea and sky.

**V**
No soft red dust clings to my staff’s tip,
For I am one who dwells on Penglai’s summit.
A blue bird brings word from beyond the clouds—
Peach blossoms of the coiled tree have bloomed for millennia.

**VI**
Palm of the immortal, Dragon Gate’s purple haze entwined,
Where Huashan’s heights touch the azure heavens.
No mortal treads beneath Lotus Peak—
I sleep deep in the heart of white clouds.

**VII**
Refined, my body light as I ride purple clouds,
To Huayang Cave I pay homage to Lord Mao.
In night’s chill, only the moon before the crag,
Its light revealing how the plum blossoms have thinned.

**VIII**
Bound for Danqiu to seek the Five Cities,
Beneath the jade peach’s boughs I sit and play the sheng.
East wind and Ma Gu’s wine leave me drunk—
Asleep by the eastern window till dawn’s glow.

**IX**
White clouds ever cling to Yuewang Terrace,
Mountains deep as indigo, waters like moss.
Jade trees bloom and fade,
While apes and cranes await my return.

**X**
Years spent dwelling in famed mountains—who can count?
Five Lakes’ winds and moon are but a misty cloak.
Sometimes returning late from gathering herbs,
I sit alone by pine roots, rinsing mouth with stone spring.

**XI**
Having read the *Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance*,
Jiuhua’s peaks glow emerald in the rain.
Before my hut, I’ve planted towering pines—
They say with age, their roots yield slender lingzhi.

**XII**
Langfeng soars above Chicheng’s rosy clouds,
In the mountains, days stretch into years.
The immortal child scorns mortal fare—
This year, the dates ripen as large as melons.

**XIII**
Beyond green mountains, a path through clouds reaches the heavens,
Moonlight limpid, shimmering in the azure void.
From whence does Dong the immortal maiden fly?
In the jade tower, deep in night, she plays her flute alone.

**XIV**
Red cliffs stretch far to the earth immortal’s home,
Where osmanthus groves lock in emerald haze.
Plowing stone fields, I sow only jade—
Spring rains awaken golden sprouts across the hills.

**XV**
A yellow lad bearing a staff, deer drawing his cart,
Through Xuanpu’s peaks he enters the Emperor’s domain.
Butterflies like fans flutter wide,
As spring winds unfurl brocade blossoms through the city.

**XVI**
Tinkling pendants, feathered robes light,
Beyond kalpas, the spirit roams from Jade Capital.
At the twelve towers, wind flows like water,
Green waves surge through ten thousand pines.

**XVII**
Gathering herbs, I thread the forest, cross perilous peaks,
Wind harmonizes with the stream’s murmuring flow.
Penglai lies but within the azure void—
Stone caves’ layered gates stand unbarred through the night.

**XVIII**
Mountain trees exhale celestial fragrance,
Within the gourd, tiered towers form an imperial realm.
Once at Yaochi, worldly thoughts dissolve—
Leisurely clouds, flowing waters, beneath a pale moon.

**XIX**
As dusk falls, pearl curtains open on every side,
Moonlight and flower shadows ascend the towers.
A strain of flute drifts through the clouds—
Surely it is Zi Jin of Hou Mountain come.

**XX**
In Yang Valley, spring brightens the jade halls,
The Queen Mother of Donghua feasts with crystal cups.
Deep in night, the wine spent, we part beneath the moon,
As paired phoenix pipes sound—riding cranes, we return.

*Eleven Lyrics to the Tune of "Spring in Qin Garden"*

**Verses Presented to Gong Quanmei**

One aperture, the Mysterious Pass—
neither high nor low,
precisely at the center.
Only when the true master points the way
does one know this aperture:
it dwells not in south or north,
belongs not to west or east.
Inwardly observe in silence,
guard in unbroken stillness—
the Dao fills the void, vast qi surges.
Hard to describe—
a single spark of news,
the root and origin of heaven and earth.

First, grasp firmly the female and male.
When celestial water arises, stir the wind of Xun.
Seal the lead crucible fast,
let the spirit soar to the sea’s depths.
Draw forth the trigram Kan’s line,
to mend the palace of Li.
Advance the fire, retreat the tally,
flowing pearls return to their place—
ten revolutions of the wheel, one qi flows through.
The numinous embryo forms,
awaiting merit perfected, the Way fulfilled,
to stride alone through the jade heavens.

**Verses Presented to Hunzhenzi**

The Dao lies hidden, nameless,
encompassing the ten thousand images,
all within body and mind.
If but a single word pierces the truth,
the original face of the moon—
neither born nor extinguished,
it shines through antiquity, soars through the present.
Turn the light inward, reflect,
preserve the spirit, sever thoughts—
directly take up the task, seek nothing beyond.
Forget words, guard—
these subtle wonders,
the profound principle runs deep.

Here, not even a needle’s space is permitted.
Best to refine the yang furnace, smelt the turbid yin.
Wait for yang to arise at winter solstice,
lock the layered gates deep.
Crow flies, hare runs,
tiger roars, dragon sings.
In a moment’s revolution,
half an hour’s union—
the great earth’s mountains and rivers all turn to gold.
Transcend the three realms,
become an immortal of Penglai,
unaffected by cold or heat.

**The Three Teachings Share One Principle**

The Dao calls it the Golden Elixir,
Confucianism calls it the Supreme Ultimate,
Buddhism calls it the Mystic Pearl.
Yet the Way of the three teachings
shares a single origin.
With the mind, uphold utmost virtue;
with nature, awaken to true suchness.
The mechanism of opening and closing,
the workings of drawing out and adding—
turn the light inward, reflect, return to the original.
Cease distinctions—
those subtle wonders
are called by no name.

In emptiness, it resembles Penglai.
Stillness, form forgotten—one, nothing.
Ask of the three teachings’ root and origin:
the valley spirit does not die,
the numinous source is limpid,
sincerity is like folly.
The five qi gather at the origin,
the five constants merge as one,
the five eyes are perfectly bright, illuminating the great void.
Immortal, Confucian, Buddha—
their streams differ, but the principle is one,
ultimately the path is the same.

**The Quanzhen Tradition’s Ethos**

No craving for fame or rank,
no seeking of wealth or honor,
no entanglement in idle strife.
A single thatched hut,
nestled by mountain, beside water—
content in poverty, guard the Dao,
quietly shut the wicker gate.
Study the alchemical classics,
burn the precious talismans—
all day, roam freely, follow one’s nature.
Truly delightful—
when hungry, eat;
when cold, don clothes.

Who knows the message within?
Outwardly, one seems dull,
inwardly, awake.
Hide the edge, blunt the sharp,
put others first, oneself last.
Blend with the world, harmonize—
why distinguish high or low?
In life, follow conditions;
rejoice in heaven, know fate.
In the snow-white gourd, pair Kan and Li.
When the time comes,
ride the clouds home
with the immortals of the Ten Isles.

**Fisherman**

No fields or gardens tilled,
idle by rivers and seas,
far removed from worldly traces.
Preserve a family’s lives,
a skiff for a home—
follow the helm’s response,
ride the waves, harness the wind.
At the bend of Nine-Curved River,
in the depths of Three Origins Pool,
cast the silver hook into the water.
Though the waves run deep,
hook the golden scales,
turn the oar toward the solitary peak.

Three sons, three daughters, together.
By the sand pot, scrub clean,
warm the stove hot.

**Fisherman (continued)**

Or crack ice to brew tea,
thirst quenched with a bowl,
trade fish for wine,
three cups shared in toast.
Unfasten the straw cloak,
lay down hat and rod,
drunk, sing of peace as the moon fills the sail.
The river and sky stretch wide—
see where the pole dips,
shattering the void.

**Woodcutter**

Home on a solitary peak,
door facing a winding stream,
a log bridge spans the gully.
At odds with worldly affairs,
heart set on livelihood—
straw cloak draped over shoulders,
axe handle slung at the waist.
In and out of hidden passes,
to and fro on secluded paths,
straight up the high mountain to gather ancient firewood.
When the time comes,
gather a thousand branches in clusters,
hoist a full load on the carrying pole.
Returning, joyous and carefree—
lay down the heavy burden,
drink a gourdful of water.
Daily needs met simply,
following fate in each moment,
today or tomorrow,
new shoots will sprout.
A song sung high,
three short notes on the flute,
stopping passing clouds to pierce the azure sky.
In this bliss,
mountains offer fruit,
the Four Greybeards beckon.

**Farmer**

A household of eight,
five acres of land,
mulberry trees planted.
Buy ten oxen from Wu,
pull the plow, drag the harrow,
turn the earth,
clear the weeds, open the wilds.
Sow seeds in season,
transplant seedlings in due time,
plant in the central field, irrigate with water.
The sacred sprouts grow—
see the fields full,
everywhere a scene of beauty.
Autumn comes, rain falls in season, times are prosperous.
Pearl-like millet grains drip with fragrant dew.
Through the six watches, diligent and wakeful,
calling sons and daughters,
gather the harvest into the granary.
Sing while striking the clods,
cook a chicken, pour wine,
wife joyful, husband respectful, share a cup.
No other affairs—
only preserve sincerity, guard simplicity,
bow to Fuxi’s reign.

**Herdsman**

Barefoot, tousled hair,
straw cloak and bamboo hat,
at ease wherever he goes.
Tends hornless calves,
never leaving their side,
walking together, resting together,
sitting together, sleeping together.
Always on familiar mountains,
evenly tending water and grass,
when stubborn, a single lash.
Returning from the pasture,
see the vast sky through the nostrils,
a soft rope gently leading.
When idle, drinks from a sacred spring,
plays a short flute descending the ridge.
Delighted when the calves are calm,
cool breeze refreshing,
heart opened wide,
all things left to heaven.
Mutually forgetting,
form and spirit both wondrous,
flowers fill the village, water fills the streams.
The true message—
if worldly folk ask,
raise a fist in reply.

**Dragon**

Quietly hidden in the deep abyss,
when moving, roams the azure expanse,
mysteriously and subtly connected.
When the time arrives, the spirit knows,
riding the yang, it rises—
thunder roars, lightning flashes,
mist gathers, clouds follow.
Tail unfurled, head raised,
piercing mountains, breaking rocks,
a single leap into the sky with mighty force.
Divine might blazes—
reversing the Yellow River,
white waves churn the void.
In an instant, torrential rain floods the earth,
yet all is contained in a single drop from heaven’s ladle.
Fires blaze across its body,
flying light, racing flames,
mountain spirits and demons vanish without a trace.
Transforming without limit,
coming and going without hindrance,
mastering the workings of heaven and earth.
When the work is done,
return with a loyal heart to the enlightened ruler,
eternally ensuring bountiful years.

**Tiger**

Born in the western mountains,
dwells in the eastern valley,
appearing and vanishing without warning.
By withered trees and rocky cliffs,
beside secluded springs and streams,
hungry, it eats; thirsty, it drinks,
content with warmth and fullness.
Roaming freely,
lifelong and fierce,
entering dense forests, parting ten thousand trees.
Who knows its truth?
Only freedom from worry and fear,
utterly without doubt.
Casually raising its brows,
a thousand-mile wind rises, eight-sided might.
Treading leaves while patrolling the mountains,
never leaving its origin,
one spirit undimmed,
a hundred beasts submit.
Leaping from sheer cliffs,
roaring to shake the earth,
moon pale, mountains cold, streams full.
Retracting claws and fangs,
concealing itself, vanishing,
alone stepping into the clouds.

**True Wind Adept**

From youth, wild and unrestrained,
lifelong and untethered,
wandering like a drifting tumbleweed.
Grasping the profound mysteries of the Three Teachings from their roots,
embracing the ten thousand phenomena,
preserving the primordial family’s way.
Ask about Buddhism—discuss the subtle,
ask about Confucianism—expound on principle,
ask about Daoism—speak of the elixir, guarding the center.
Without attachment,
when idle, seize a tiger,
when enraged, capture a dragon.
Unbound by north, south, east, or west,
strolling carefree, everywhere at ease.
On Mount Taihua’s peak,
at the Jade Pool gathering,
poems of ten thousand words composed,
a thousand cups of wine consumed.
Clouds rise beneath his feet,
thunder roars from his sleeves,
a sword’s cold light piercing the nine heavens.
True Wind Adept—
beyond heaven and earth,
splitting the void.

**Two *Shuidiao Getou* Lyrics**
*Oral Instructions to the Master of Primordial Chaos*

The Great Dao has no form,
true nature is not empty.
Within it, creation and transformation,
being and non-being,
merge in profound unity.
Penetrate the one aperture of the mysterious pass,
then turn back and begin the work,
diligently cultivating in stillness.
Harmonize with subtle wonders,
morning and night, using *tun* and *meng*.
Gather true lead,
refine true mercury,
restore the true origin.
Yang arises at midnight,
the heavy gates deeply locked, riding the dragon in reverse.
Circulate the fire of the celestial cycle,
flow *wu* to capture essence, refine *ji*,
the three natures meet in the original palace.
Bright and clear, transcending past and present,
spiritual resonance wondrous and boundless.

*Oral Instructions to the Master of Returning Yang*

Nature requires no cultivation or verification,
life demands action.
Understanding this principle,
the Dao relies on the mysterious female as its root.
To attain the undying valley spirit,
dwell in the village of the southwest,
never doubting.
Movement and stillness, dual in function,
know the right time to begin.
Play with true emptiness,
regulate true breath,
activate true mechanism.
Lead is born, mercury produced, sealed,
the elixir furnace refines purple mushrooms.
Turn the handle of the Silver River’s Dipper,
draw out the one stroke within *Kan*,
directly mend *Li* in the south.
When the work is complete and merit fulfilled,
ascend the celestial steps with flying strides.

**Lyric to the Tune *Man Ting Fang***

Cultivating truth amidst the mundane,
living in the world yet transcending it,
awakening to nature must come first.
Keep the heart pure and still,
constantly abiding in meditative absorption.
Embrace simplicity, reduce thoughts and desires,
forget self and others,
content with one’s lot, at ease.
In action and retreat,
unfettered and free,
thirsty, drink; weary, sleep.

「问归根复命，还须立鼎，炼汞烹铅。
遇采铅时节，把火先搧。
握固则云藏烟聚，运动则斗转星旋。
半时内，玄机成象，月白照青天。

**Lyric to the Tune *Man Jiang Hong* (Two Verses)**

*First Verse:*
A single spark of luminous essence,
descending through form to dwell in the heart’s chamber.
Its depth is the Dao of the Dao, subtle and profound,
yet radiant and clear.
Because of greed for life and love of desires,
one’s habits gradually forget the true marvel.
Better to grasp it now and swiftly return—
reclaim the light, awaken to the Way’s true mechanism,
and preserve the Three Essentials.

*Second Verse:*
Refine silver-lead, forge golden elixir—
only three sacred elixirs are needed.
At Winter Solstice, when Yang is born, begin the work,
and gather with careful measure.
Draw from *Kan* to fill *Li*,
merge the essence and stoke the fire,
align the axis and revolve the compass.
A child of innocence rides the Dragon,
ascending in an instant to the Southern Peak.
From the *Qian* Palace, the union returns,
the Dragon and Tiger subdued—
husband and wife, both trembling with joy.
The *Xun* door opens wide, great fire blazes,
nine cycles condense the elixir, vast and mighty.
In the Mysterious Valley, the wind arises,
the Nature of Heaven scatters clouds—
ten thousand Dao’s divine light shines forth.
When the practice is complete,
in later years, one shall return in the *Luan* carriage.

**Lyric to the Tune *Nan Lü* – *Golden Character Scripture* (Five Verses)**

#1
In the first watch, with no affairs to attend,
sitting upon the *Lingtai* in stillness.
Close the *Dui* and hang the curtain on all eight sides—
open, and pure winds enter the hall.
Regulate true breath,
harmonize the *qi* to return naturally.

#2
In the second watch, when Heaven is tranquil,
engage with true emptiness,
the Eight Extremes without dust, the moon centered.
Within, the single intention of the Western Sage is made clear.
In the golden furnace, rosy light penetrates the cauldron’s red.

#3
In the third watch, the rooster crows—Yang is born,
the moon sets in the cold pool, the Dipper’s handle lies horizontal.
Horizontal, the mud-ox trembles in the ocean’s depths.
Three cycles turn, the Yellow River’s waters flow backward.

#4
In the fourth watch, the Northern Dipper faces south,
the fire circulates through the Heavenly Circuits, piercing the Jade Pass.
At the Pass, the Dragon roars and the Tiger howls.
The divine elixir forms—
a chill light permeates the body to the bone.

#5
In the fifth watch, the Five *Qi* converge in unity,
seven golden lotuses bloom from the seed.
The lotuses open, bearing fresh dew.
The Celestial Gate breaks—
divine light illuminates the Great Thousand.

**Lyric to the Tune *Lian Dan Sha* (Two Verses)**

*First Verse:*
Learning the Dao is not hard to know—
it lies entirely in human effort.
One must rely on the Mysterious Female (*Xuanpin*) to establish the foundation.
Continuously draw from *Kan* to fill *Li* without pause,
and forge the *Xixi*—
the divine essence remains still, dependent on itself.
The Dragon and Tiger submit in obedience.
From the void, nurture a babe.
When it bursts through the crown’s gate, the divine appears—
its radiance shines brightly.

*Second Verse:*
Studying Buddhism, one plays with true emptiness.
It must be recognized within the Mysterious.
The luminous void is not obscured—this is the root principle.
Without form, sound, scent, taste, touch, or *dharma*,
one exhausts the *shiksa*—
the body of bare bones.
Adapt with sharp insight—
the Three Realms are roundly penetrated.

「The Wooden Man and the Stony Woman laugh in the spring breeze.
The vast earth and mountains and rivers return to a single grain of dust, embracing and encompassing all.

**Five Verses on the *West River Moon* (*Xījiāngyuè*)**

To practice the Dao, first illuminate the **Mysterious Female** (*Xuanpin*).
To cultivate the **True** (*Zhen*), one must exert effort.
The three elixirs are not one-sided or exhausted;
They also demand firmness and enlightenment.

Beneath the moon, the jade hare is seized,
From the sea, the golden rooster is captured.
In half a moment, fire is directed into the **Kun** (*Kun*) furnace.
Refined, the **divine elixir** (*shen dan*) emerges firm and unyielding.

Again,
Enlightenment has neither birth nor death;
Lead is taken with presence and absence.
The two **sacred substances** (*lingwu*) unite in the **golden womb** (*jin tai*).
Clouds and vapors perpetually hover over the **treasure canopy** (*baogai*).
All day, light mingles with the mundane,
At all times and places, the heart remains expansive.
Pure winds and bright moons fill the **Penglai Islands** (*Penglai*).
The illusions of emptiness are pierced without attainment.

Again,
**Li** (*Li*) shifts to become the **radiant maiden** (*Zhen nü*), while **Kan** (*Kan*) is the **baby** (*yīng’ér*).
The two are separated by east and west.
At first, the **Yellow Crone** (*Huángpó*) bridges their harmony.
Each time the **Yang** (*yang*) force arises at the **Winter Solstice** (*Dōngzhì*),
Then husband and wife move in unison.
In one moment, they gather to ascend to the **Jade Pool of Immortality** (*Yáo-chí*).
Together, they drink the **elixir of longevity** (*dāo guī*), rejoicing in divine play.

Again,
Silently wrapped in luminous **qi** (*qi*), motionless and profound,
Within the **Mysterious Middle** (*Xuanzhong*), breath is subtly attuned, soft and ceaseless.

The **True Void** is pierced, its measure boundless.
One beholds the **original form** in its pristine essence.
Though **void and luminous** yet unobscured,
Still, **mercury must be added**, **lead extracted**.
Ever in **water and fire**, the crucible’s alchemy is refined—
Then **divine radiance** emerges anew.

Again,
Before entering the **inner chamber**, one must know the **first move**,
Setting the **furnace** demands mastery of the craft.
When **Geng** is born, swiftly gather at the **Yellow Center**.
Reverse the **Celestial Wheel**, setting it in motion.
The **Infant of Red** ascends as spirit into the **Sea**,
While the **Azure Dragon** mounts the **Southern Palace**.
In an instant, they **whistle and chant** in the **Sandy Void**,
Ten **Extremes** of **Immortal Worthies** pay homage.
The **Gathering of the True** is concluded—below, the **five following stanzas** are **scattered lyrics** (*sǎnqǔ xiǎolìng*).
The **tune** is also named *„**Perusing the Golden Scripture**.*”
