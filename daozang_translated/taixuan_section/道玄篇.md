**Chapter One: The Great Dao**
The Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth, thus it can give birth to Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth encompass all things, thus they can nourish all things.
All things are diverse and manifold—none without the Dao.
The Dao is formless and void, yet it gives rise to things to establish the Dao’s own form.
The *xing* (form/shape) is the Dao’s dwelling, the *shen* (spirit/soul) is the Dao’s mechanism.
All things possess their own *Tai Ji* (Supreme Polarity), their movement and stillness in harmony with the Dao yet never departing from it.

---

**Chapter Two: The Mysterious Extremes**
The boundless is called the Dao, the Supreme Polarity is called the *shen* (body).
The body contains its own body, hence it is called *tianxin* (Heavenly Heart).
The Heavenly Heart abides in tranquility and centrality, its spirit mechanism sovereign yet void and luminous.
Its responses are ever pure, all transformations return to truth.
Its spirit follows the obscured nature of things, yet all transformations arise spontaneously.
Is it not that the Dao is distant from humanity, but rather that humanity itself distances itself from the Dao?

---

**Chapter Three: The Allocation of Fate**
No human is born without fate.
No fate is bestowed without inherent *xing* (nature).
This *xing* is the *shen* (spirit), this fate is the *qi* (vital breath).
The spirit governs the body, the *qi* sustains the body.
The spirit remains unlost in its guardianship, the *qi* unlost in its regulation.
When spirit and *qi* merge as one, the Dao flows unobstructed and never decays.
Thus one may attain longevity and enduring vision, transcending the dust and clamor of the mundane.

---

**Chapter Four: Illuminating Principles**
The Dao does not stand alone, thus it gives rise to things to establish its form.
The Dao does not act in vain, thus it gives rise to humanity to enact its will.
Therefore, if one can illuminate Heaven and Earth’s eternal laws,
know the interplay of *yin* and *yang* (polarities),
grasp the methods of creation and transformation,
one may hold the fundamental threads of all things.

Who else but the *sheng ren* (Sage) could forge such principles?

---

**Chapter Five: Marvelous Applications**
Heaven and Earth are the physical manifestations of *yin* and *yang*’s polarities,
while *yin* and *yang* are the transformative mechanisms of Heaven and Earth.
The *yang* is odd, the *yin* is even;
*yin* is the substance, *yang* the nourishment.
One ascends, one descends—both never depart.
Thus all things have their pairings, each following its kind in propagation.
Hence, when the male moves and the female stirs not,
the harmony of Heaven and Earth may be discerned.

---

**Chapter Six: The Nature of Humanity and Things**
Humans receive *qi* fully, things receive *qi* partially.
The spirit’s unity in fate is granted to each by Heaven.
In humans, this nature has both good and evil;
in things, this nature also has good and evil.
Why so? It is the differing *qi*’s inherent disposition,
not the nature’s original essence.
Thus all things selfishly cling to the Dao,
not the Dao clinging to all things.

---

**Chapter Seven: The Dao’s Indwelling in Form**
There is no thing beneath Heaven without principle, no land without the Dao’s presence.
Where there is a thing’s form, there is its nature;
where there is its nature, there is its disposition;
where there is its disposition, there is its Dao.
The Dao’s presence in things relies on form to manifest its transformations in the world.
Thus nothing can resist transformation, nothing can escape its embrace.
Even the *long* (dragon) and *hu* (tiger) in their changes—
I forget their mechanisms, yet they submit of their own accord.

---

**Chapter Eight: The Dragon and the Tiger**
The dragon’s song, the tiger’s roar.
The dragon attains the Dao of *yang* (vitality), the tiger the omen of *yin* (passivity).
*Yang* in the dragon, *yin* in the tiger—each has its own subtlety.
Thus the dragon sings and clouds follow, the tiger roars and winds arise.
Winds and clouds transform, thunder and lightning crash.
Yet in their blind unity, they breathe as one—
not the Great Transformation’s own sentience.
Therefore, when the Sage acts, divine transformations are unfathomable,
and all things gather in silent reverence.

---

**Chapter Nine: Rectifying Position**
Heaven covers above, Earth bears below—all things arise between them.
The Sage rectifies his position to bring peace to all.
He who dwells in greatness fulfills greatness,
he who dwells in smallness fulfills smallness.
The people are my kin, yet I treat them as children.
Thus when I forget, the people forget;
when I rejoice, the people rejoice;
when I am at ease, the people are at ease.
Hence, when *Yao* ruled as sovereign,
he governed Heaven and Earth for fifty years yet claimed no merit—
this was his way.

---

**Chapter Ten: The Virtue of Humility**
The Sage in his exalted position does not exalt himself,
does not regard himself as noble,
does not claim his own brilliance,
does not boast of his own merits—
this is how he empties himself to await others.
Thus he does not exalt himself, to follow the multitude of Heaven and Earth.
He does not regard himself as noble, to measure the worth of the world’s worthy.
He does not claim his own brilliance, to exhaust the world’s perspectives.
He does not boast of his own merits, to reward the world’s deeds.
This is how he cultivates humility in himself,
and only then does his virtue extend to benefit all.
Thus the people of Heaven and Earth cannot but revere him.

---

**Chapter Eleven: Sovereign and Minister**
A sovereign without ministers cannot rise, a minister without a sovereign cannot act.
When sovereign and minister share one heart, none can take Heaven and Earth.
The sovereign views the people as his children, the people view the sovereign as their mother.
Child and mother in mutual affection—none can speak against it.
My relationship to the Dao:
I nurture it as a mother, guard it as a child.
Child and mother in mutual protection—
longevity and immortality are attained.
I do not seek to differ from others,
yet those who would depart cannot remain.

---

**Chapter Twelve: Dao and Virtue**
The Dao is the ultimate of goodness, *de* (virtue/power) is the foundation of goodness.
The highest goodness is not claimed as goodness—its Dao is naturally goodness.
The highest virtue is not claimed as virtue—its Dao is naturally virtue.
What virtue can be obtained? None but that from the heart,
illuminated by principle, to fulfill all things’ natures.
Nature is void yet loves to give birth—
thus all things share in Dao and virtue.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Mandate of Heaven**
The mandate was first passed to Yi, then to the Son.
Yet the people sang no praises to Yi, but only to the Son—
thus Heaven favored the Son, and the mandate was passed to him.
After this, father and son succeeded one another,
but only when worthy could they be entrusted with the realm,
and only then could they receive the mandate.

**Chapter Fourteen: Preservation and Guardianship**
To fear Heaven’s command preserves the self.
To fear the words of the Sage guards the law.
Preserve the self and you endure long;
guard the law and you achieve greatness.
Endure long and your family and state face no peril;
achieve greatness and your descendants face no ruin.
Without peril or ruin, you may preserve yourself and avoid harm.

**Chapter Fifteen: Clarity and Emptiness**
A mirror, when empty, is clear—
it naturally reveals the beauty and ugliness of all.
The heart, when empty, is clear—
it naturally knows the goodness and evil of all.
Emptiness gathers form,
clarity discerns color.
But form and color are mere illusions,
not the true essence.
Thus, the Sage holds emptiness supreme.

**Chapter Sixteen: Preserving the Form**
How can people, born to life,
fail to fear death?
Climbing steep paths of the Dao,
they lose their true nature.
Why does the wild horse run without reins,
galloping without direction,
going forth yet never returning?
Ever light and reckless, indulging in wild greed,
they hoard life yet bring ruin upon themselves—
I have seen many such people.
Thus, the Sage always fears Heaven’s command,
guards his station with reverence,
preserves his *qi*,
and nurtures his nature.
Therefore, all things under Heaven
harmonize with me in divine correspondence.

**Chapter Seventeen: Rites and Music**
In daily life, rites and music must not be neglected.
With rites, the heart attends to reverence;
with music, the body attends to harmony.
When the heart attends to reverence,
all affairs are orderly.
When the body attends to harmony,
all spirits are at ease.
When spirits are at ease,
*qi* fills the void of the *chong* [conception vessel].

**Chapter Eighteen: Spirit and *Qi***
Those who nurture the spirit well
restore their radiance day and night.
Those who gather *qi* well
merge their essence with each breath.
The spirit dwells within *qi*,
*qi* dwells within the spirit’s chamber.
When spirit and *qi* unite in truth,
they ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

**Chapter Nineteen: Perfect Clarity**
To focus inward is to forget the outer;
to focus outward is to forget the inner.
This is not the Dao!
How can one nature be perfectly clear,
when it is neither inner nor outer?
Its existence has no form,
its application leaves no trace.
Thus, the Sage’s Way is but turning a sphere—
nothing more.

**Chapter Twenty: Insufficiency**
The good lack, the unvirtuous also lack.
The good lack because of insufficient learning;
the unvirtuous lack because of insatiable greed.
To seek learning’s insufficiency is to attain clarity;
to seek greed’s insufficiency is to fall into darkness.
Clarity leads to sainthood,
darkness ends in folly.
Clarity and darkness differ by a hair’s breadth—
how can one not be cautious?

**Chapter Twenty-One: Ceasing Learning**
Study the learning of the masses,
select the good to learn from it.
Exhaust the principles of all things,
illuminate what is unclear.
To abandon all learning is to have no worries;
to exhaust all principles is to return to the root.
Without worries, one fulfills all things’ natures;
with the root, one attains the Dao of all things.
Nature and the Heavenly Way
are in perfect accord.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Middle Path**
Only the Sage can walk the Middle Way;
even the virtuous cannot follow.
How much less the foolish!
The Sage makes it round—
the virtuous make it square.
The round turns without clinging;
the square clings without turning.
Thus the Sage says:
The virtuous exceed it,
the foolish fall short.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Dignity and Comportment**
The Sage’s heart is deep, unfathomable,
vast and transforming, without limit.
His bearing is awe-inspiring,
his virtue radiant and resplendent.
His virtue flows in cycles of three and five,
emptying himself to align the four seasons
as the standard for all under Heaven.
When he sets the standard for all under Heaven,
all things come into harmony.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Transformation and Motion**
The Dao is vast and boundless,
moving through the *tuo* [mysterious vessel].
The Dao, as a thing, is dim and indistinct,
fathomless and unfathomable.
You cannot see its edges,
you cannot pierce its depths.
Great, it encompasses Earth and Heaven;
small, it leaves no thing untouched.
I too am in this—
before the Nameless.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: Penetrating the Mysterious**
Who is the master when the tongue speaks?
Who leads when the hand forms a fist?
To grasp this principle
is to penetrate the Mysterious.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Essence of the Dao**
The Dao’s essence lies hidden in its orifices.
Preserve the essence and life-*qi* is born;
preserve *qi* and spirit is born;
preserve the spirit and divine mystery is attained.
These three must not be lost—
lose one, and the other two are lost as well.
What then remains of the Dao?

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Gain and Loss**
Do not rejoice at a single gain,
nor grieve at a single loss.
Gain without knowing when to stop—
what you gain, you will surely lose.
Lose while knowing what to guard—
what you lose, you will surely regain.
Thus, those who gain lose,
and those who lose gain.
Only those who grasp the Dao’s essence
can truly know gain and loss.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Calming the Heart**
Grass and trees take root in the earth to grow.
Humans take root in the heart to establish life and fate.
Fertile soil makes branches and leaves flourish;
an empty heart makes virtue and power permeate.
Yet people do not know their roots—
they steal from things with their hearts,
only to be stolen from by things in return;
they enslave their emotions to form,
only to be enslaved by form in return.
Thus, the one who gains loses,
and the one who loses gains.
Therefore, the Daoist takes nothing.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Forgetting Artifice**
When humans forget artifice,
birds do not doubt.
When humans’ artifice stirs,
birds take flight far away.
Why?
Form may be deceived, but spirit cannot.
When my spirit stirs slightly,
their spirit knows it instantly.
This is the manifest Heavenly Principle
that cannot be concealed.

---

**Chapter Thirty: The True Void**
The True Void gives rise to the manifestation of form,
and when form is held, it clings to the True Void.
The True Void is not form itself,
and when it is held, it clings to form.
Clinging to form and clinging to the True Void—
those who do not recognize the essence of the Dao.
Thus, the form that is not form is the true form;
the void that is not void is the true void.
True form and true void merge with all things.
To apply this and transcend its application—
its transformations are boundless.

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Doctrine of Having and Not-Having**
Not-having while appearing to have is the superior;
having while appearing not to have is the inferior.
Thus, the virtuous scholar broadens learning and knowledge,
not-having while truly possessing.
The petty scholar restricts learning and knowledge,
not-possessing while assuming it is.
Therefore, I do not dare to lead the world—
this is what Laozi meant.
If it were about virtue and benevolence,
how could I dare?—
this is what Confucius meant.
Having as if not-having, being real as if void—
this is what Yanzi meant.
Thus, the one with humility in virtue is superior,
the one with thin virtue is inferior.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Weight of the Dao**
Those who weigh heavily upon others are weighed heavily by others;
those who treat others lightly are treated lightly by others.
Even things should not be treated lightly—
how much more so for humans?
Thus, the Sage governs the people as a tender infant,
honors the worthy and values virtue.
Therefore, he does not dare to treat the world lightly,
and the world’s people are at ease—
how could he not be weighed heavily?

**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Five Methods of Governance**
There are five methods by which the world is governed in accordance with the Dao:
To spread benevolence (*rén*) across the world, the people are at peace;
To impose righteousness (*yì*) upon the world, the people submit;
To teach propriety (*lǐ*) to the world, the people show respect;
To discern wisdom (*zhì*) across the world, the people are steadfast;
To cultivate trust (*xìn*) with the world, the people stand firm.
These five methods arise from the same source but differ in name.
Thus, the Sage embodies the Dao as if it were void,
yet applies it with abundance.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: Observing the Dao**
Observing the Dao is like observing the plum blossom.
The sea dwells in lowliness,
yet it can contain the flow of all rivers.
Its gathering is deep,
its waves rise high,
and dragons, fish, shrimp, and turtles all find joy in their nature.
Thus, the Sage’s heart is also like the sea,
and it can contain the filth of all nations.
The more it stores the heart,
the more void and deep it becomes;
the more it acts in the world,
the more abundant and present it is.
Rulers and commoners alike
find joy in their own place.
This is why the Dao is present in the world,
and the lowly become the exalted.
The Void of the True Void.

**Chapter Thirty-Five: The True Void**
The True Void gives rise to form,
and form returns to the True Void.
The True Void is the heart and spirit;
form is the body and *qi*.
When the heart is void,
the spirit is at ease,
and the body and *qi* are abundant.
When the heart is clouded,
the spirit is obstructed,
and the body and *qi* self-destruct.
Thus, the Sage always maintains a void heart,
and is skilled in nurturing spirit and *qi*.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Constant Heart**
Those who possess a constant heart have a constant Dao;
those who lack a constant heart lack a constant Dao.
A constant heart does not falter,
a constant Dao does not alter;
a constant heart is not absent,
a constant Dao is not exhausted.
Therefore, the virtuous scholar always abides in a tranquil heart,
and examines himself from within.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Loyalty and Filial Piety**
Those who are good at loyalty must be good at filial piety,
and those who are good at filial piety must be good at loyalty.
At home, one transfers loyalty and filial piety to one’s parents,
and the way of the son is complete.
Abroad, one transfers loyalty and filial piety to one’s lord,
and the way of the subject is complete.
Thus, lord and parents are one;
loyalty and filial piety are also one.
Those who excel in both loyalty and filial piety
embody the Dao of Heaven.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Rectifying Nature**
Confucius would not drink from the stolen well,
and Zengzi turned his carriage around to avoid passing by his mother’s village.
Even the ancients, upon hearing an unrighteous name,
avoided it themselves—
how much more so for the Dao they practice?

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Holding the Middle**
The Sage’s Dao is simply to hold the middle.
To bear the world’s responsibilities,
to walk the world’s Dao—
whether high or low,
all are treated with equal balance.
What benefits is diminished,
what diminishes is benefited.
Benefiting the lowly,
the humble rise upward;
dimishing the exalted,
the high fall to the low.
This is why, in diminishing excess and benefiting deficiency,
the high and low are in harmony,
and all affairs in the world are balanced.

**Chapter Forty: Essence and Application**
Embody the Dao with sincerity,
and the Dao will find its own ease.
Apply the Dao in due season,
and the Dao will find its own benefit.
Thus, one who is at ease within
has a spirit that is never discordant.
One who benefits without
has a spirit that is never obstructed.
To observe the Dao in stillness,
the Dao is never still;
to observe the Dao in motion,
the Dao is never in motion.
Motion and stillness merge with the Dao—
only sincerity can achieve this.

**Chapter Forty-One: The Spirit’s Void**
Human spirit is the void essence of Heaven and Earth.
The nature of spirit
cannot be pondered,
cannot be perceived,
cannot be spoken of,
cannot be sought.
Why?
To ponder it makes it not spirit,
to perceive it makes it not sincere,
to speak of it makes it not pure,
to seek it makes it not true.
Thus, it hides the small body,
and encompasses the Great Void;
it reveals the great body,
and pervades the dust of the world;
it enters water and does not drown,
it enters fire and is not burned;
it pierces metal and penetrates stone,
it emerges from darkness and reaches the depths.
Those who understand this principle
can command the spirits and deities.

**Chapter Forty-Two: Unobstructed Understanding**
The heart must not be held fast,
affairs must not be rigidly adhered to.
When the heart is held fast,
nature does not reach its fullness;
when affairs are rigidly adhered to,
principle does not flow freely.
A void heart aligns with Heaven,
and nature is fully realized.
Walking the Dao aligns with righteousness,
and principle flows freely.
Thus, the Sage conceals his heart within the four directions,
and his affairs are never rigidly held.
The Auspicious Effect.

**Chapter Forty-Three: The Auspicious and the Inauspicious**
The auspicious person purifies himself to serve Heaven,
the inauspicious person defiles his conduct to seek sustenance.
The Dao of serving Heaven
lies in frugality and restraint.
The Dao of seeking sustenance
lies in coveting abundance.
Thus, the frugal are necessarily virtuous and abundant in power,
and Heaven’s Dao always aids the auspicious;
the covetous are necessarily lost in abundance,
and the spirits’ Dao often confuses the inauspicious.
Therefore, the pursuit of food
is the root of all disorder in nature.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The Knowing of Stopping**
Fish swim in deep streams, beasts rely on lofty heights.
Each creature knows where to cease—
why does man lose his heart,
yet fail to know his home?

Thus, the heart is the sovereign of the body.
To possess it brings flourishing,
to lose it brings ruin.
**Chapter Forty-Five: Attending to the Root**
The movement of the Dao splits into two functions.
Therefore, creation and transformation mutually support,
good and evil interdependently arise,
life and death follow in tandem,
the strong exploit the weak,
and kindness and harm lean upon each other.
Those who fail to recognize the root
while chasing after superficial ends—
these are the deluded of mankind.

Hence, those who skillfully wield the Dao
preserve its essence,
follow its applications,
restrain movement to return to stillness,
and restore feeling to its original nature.
When nature is empty and aligned with truth,
they enjoy the Way’s command with tranquil ease.

**Chapter Forty-Six: The Natural**
The spider weaves its web,
the dung beetle rolls its ball—
without instruction yet mastering their arts,
this is the natural work of Heaven’s inherent nature.

Thus, the Sage also embodies the Dao’s natural spontaneity,
ever teaching the people to hold fast to simplicity and sincerity:
to drink from dug wells,
to eat from tilled fields,
without revealing their knowing,
without letting them grasp their doing.
In their mutual exchanges without harm,
the people reach old age and die without litigation,
rejoicing in the harmonious concord of *Yongxi*’s [1] peace.

Even with governance and decrees—
what need is there for their enforcement?

**Chapter Forty-Seven: The Response**

The Dao’s manifestation in the divine and hidden—
its virtue and power are evident.

The dragon’s transformations, the tiger’s shifts—
the flow of *qi* is harmonized.

The Sage acts in accordance with Heaven’s time,
and human hearts respond.

Thus, the divine changes of the Sage—
ghostly apparitions are beyond measure.
The transformations of dragon and tiger—
insects and beasts are beyond measure.
The Sage’s changes—
the masses are beyond measure.
If the divine can be measured,
it is not divine.
If dragon and tiger can be measured,
they are no different from common creatures.
If the Sage can be measured,
the world will not revere Him.

Therefore, those who dwell in the great—
ever maintain their solemn authority,
ever uphold their divine essence.
With the Dao transforming the world,
the world returns to His embrace.

---

**Chapter Forty-Eight: Self-Reliance**

Those who rely on wealth and noble status
must grow arrogant in themselves.
Those who rely on achievements and renown
must grow restless in themselves.
Those who rely on learning and letters
must grow contemptuous in themselves.
Those who rely on favor and affection
must bring shame upon themselves.

These four forms of reliance—
they are the afflictions of man.
Thus, arrogance brings no longevity,
restlessness brings no endurance,
contempt brings no illumination,
shame brings no fortune.

Therefore, the virtuous man in wealth and noble status
does not grow self-important,
in success and renown
does not claim them as his own,
in extensive learning
does not boast of his knowledge,
in favor and affection
does not flaunt his standing.

Guard against the slightest beginnings,
check the growth of evil,
balance action and stillness with the Dao,
and remain serene and unassuming.

---

**Chapter Forty-Nine: Attaining Harmony**

When Heaven’s Dao loses harmony,
the sun and moon grow dim in their brilliance.
When Earth’s Dao loses harmony,
mountains and stones crumble and topple.
When Man’s Dao loses harmony,
his vital *qi* scatters and dissipates.
When the Four Seasons lose harmony,
all things do not flourish.

Yet how does Heaven attain harmony and so radiate purity?
The sun and moon shine naturally.
How does Earth attain harmony and so bring lasting peace?
Mountains and stones stand firm of their own accord.
How does Man attain harmony and so become spiritually attuned?
His vital *qi* condenses naturally.
How do the Four Seasons attain harmony and so move in their course?
All things flourish naturally.

Therefore, those who follow this Dao
adapt to the transformations of yin and yang.
Those who return to this Dao
may tread upon the void.

---

**Chapter Fifty: The Creative Transformation**

Heaven has day and night,
the coming and going of one *qi*.
Man has life and death,
the gathering and scattering of one *qi*.
Day and night, life and death—
they share the same Creative Transformation.

Thus, there must be night when there is day,
death when there is life,
return when there is departure,
dispersion when there is gathering—
these are the necessary principles.

Only the divine in Heaven and Earth
illuminates the void without form,
neither born nor dying,
neither gathering nor scattering.
Thus, it knows without words,
reaches without movement,
acquires without thought,
and achieves without action.

He who comprehends this
may transcend life and death,
escape Heaven and Earth.

---

**Chapter Fifty-One: Borrowed Speech**

The Sage employs borrowed speech to reveal the Dao—
his words have no fixed form.
The worthy man seizes upon speech to discuss the Dao—
his words bear concrete symbols.

Thus, speech without fixed form
holds meaning before the image is drawn.
Speech with concrete symbols
holds meaning after the image is drawn.
If the worthy man could abandon form and discard wisdom,
preserve the divine and embrace the center,
dwelling in speech with symbols yet not clinging—
he would also be a Sage.

---

**Chapter Fifty-Two: Non-Contentiousness**

The Dao is without contention,
yet those who contend are not of the Dao.
The Dao is without attachment,
yet those who cling are not of the Dao.

Thus, those who love contention
possess discriminating wisdom,
those who love attachment
know distinctions of self and other.
They are the ones who see,
yet abandon the Dao,
and lose its virtue.

Therefore, the Sage wears coarse garments to conceal his brilliance,
holds jade within his breast,
dwelling among the people without contention,
without attachment,
preserving and uniting the *qi* of Great Harmony,
and aligning with Heaven and Earth in the Four Seasons.

---
**Chapter Fifty-Three: Dao’s Transformation**

The Dao transforms *qi*,
*qi* forms blood,
blood shapes the body,
the body gives rise to things,
things transform into myriad forms.

Its transformations are not singular,
yet its divine essence is one.

When *qi* transforms into turbidity,
its divine essence is malevolent.
When *qi* transforms into clarity,
its divine essence is luminous.

The lifeless becoming sentient,
the sentient becoming lifeless—
they are the same *qi* in division,
all things diverse in form yet unified in essence.

Observe the beginning of Great Transformation,
where there is neither form nor name.

---
**Chapter Fifty-Four: Public Heart**

As a minister of the Sage,
one who aids the ruler with the Dao
must purify himself to serve the public good.

If the ruler does not restrict his benevolence,
the virtue of the ruler will descend.
If the minister does not restrict his words,
the sentiments of the people will ascend.
When ruler and minister are in harmony,
the Dao of the state will always flourish.

If one gains favor from above,
secretly wields power,
and seeks personal gain through authority—
he will surely invite disaster.
Is this not a truth?

**Chapter Fifty-Four: Public Heart**

The upright Sage and the virtuous gentleman,
calm and open in their hearts.
When employed, they expound the Dao in court and hall;
when not employed, they retreat into the woods, humble and unassuming.
In wealth and honor, they do not grow arrogant;
in poverty and lowliness, they do not fawn.
Advancing and withdrawing, they measure the proper course;
in action and repose, they conform to what is fitting.
They always follow the Way of Heaven without deceit in their hearts—
thus they may be called the upright Sage and the virtuous gentleman.

**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Rectified Person**

The *Dao Xuan* [Mysterious Dao] section concludes.
