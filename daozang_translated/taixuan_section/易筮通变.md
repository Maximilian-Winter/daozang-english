#### On Divination

The *Hong Fan*’s *"Ji Yi"* states: "Select and appoint diviners, then command them to divine." The *Odes* says: "You divine with milfoil, you divine with turtle—may the omens be without fault." And again: "When divination with turtle and milfoil concur, their words meet in agreement." The *"Monthly Ordinances"* in the *Records* further states: "In the first month of winter, the Grand Scribe anoints the turtle and milfoil to divine the auspices of good and ill." Thus, turtle and milfoil seem to be mutually indispensable in their use.

The *Great Commentary* of the *Changes* says: "To probe the obscure and seek the hidden, to draw forth the profound and reach the distant, thereby resolving the perplexities of the world—nothing surpasses the turtle and milfoil." It also states: "Those who divine with turtle and milfoil esteem their interpretations." Therefore, the *Changes* ought to encompass the uses of both turtle and milfoil.

The *Da Gao* says: "King Wen bequeathed to me the great treasure-turtle, continuing the luminous mandate of Heaven, and I acted accordingly." The *Jin Teng* records: "He divined with three turtles, and one was repeatedly auspicious." Yet in these instances, no mention is made of milfoil divination.

The *Records* further states: "The Son of Heaven does not use milfoil divination; the feudal lords have their official diviners." And again: "The Son of Heaven’s Way relies on milfoil divination." Here, too, no mention is made of turtle divination. However, the *"Shuo Gua"* declares: "Of old, the sages composed the *Changes*, subtly aiding the numinous and engendering milfoil, measuring Heaven and Earth to establish numbers, observing the transformations of yin and yang to set forth the hexagrams, unfolding the interplay of firm and yielding to generate the lines, harmonizing with the Dao/Way and virtue/power to order righteousness, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny." Here, the text exclusively attributes the method to milfoil divination, without ever mentioning turtle divination.

From the milfoil, the stalks are commanded, and the use of milfoil divination is expounded in the *Great Expansion*’s numbers with utmost clarity and completeness. Yet turtle divination is not so much as alluded to in a single phrase. Though elsewhere one may find the distinction that "turtle is for divination, milfoil for casting," and though I, from my youth, have often witnessed common divination by tossing coins to draw hexagrams and lines—a practice said to have begun with Jing Fang—and though Jia Gongyan also speaks of using coins for the single, broken, doubled, and intersecting lines of hexagram-casting, and though there are even those who borrow the turtle’s plastron to arrange their coins, and though miscellaneous records speak of "divining such-and-such a hexagram" in general terms, and though people commonly refer to "divining hexagrams" (卜卦), thereby conflating turtle and milfoil divination as one, I have never given it much thought.

Yet I have observed that among the offices of the *Zhou Rituals*’ *"Spring Offices,"* the Grand Diviner oversees the three methods of omen-reading: the first is the jade omen, the second the tile omen, and the third the plain omen. The configurations of their omens each number one hundred and twenty, and their incantations total one thousand two hundred. Below him, the Diviner-Masters preside over the opening of turtle omens, while the Turtle-Keepers manage the six turtles, distinguishing them by their directions and colors, as well as by their forms. The Grand Diviner also oversees the three *Yi* systems: the first is the *Lian Shan*, the second the *Gui Cang*, and the third the *Zhou Changes*. Their primary hexagrams each number eight, and their derived hexagrams each number sixty-four. Below him, the Milfoil Diviners preside over the nine milfoil divinations of the three *Yi*, distinguishing good and ill. For all great matters of state, milfoil divination precedes turtle divination. In the first month of spring, they divine for the harvest, and for all state affairs, they perform milfoil divination. Only afterward do they know to use the turtle, inscribing its omens. The configurations and incantations of the omens reach as many as one hundred twenty and one thousand two hundred, whereas the *Changes*’ milfoil divination fundamentally does not exceed the sixty-four hexagrams. Thus, turtle divination is turtle divination, and milfoil divination is milfoil divination—they have never been used interchangeably.

Moreover, the *Hong Fan* clearly distinguishes between "turtle follows, milfoil follows," "turtle follows, milfoil opposes," and "both turtle and milfoil contradict the person," demonstrating that the division between turtle and milfoil divination is stark, their black and white distinct. Yet later explanations of divination have become so confused and chaotic as to reach this extreme, which I find deeply perplexing. Therefore, I have examined cases in the *Zuozhuan* and the like to verify their outcomes, thereby clearly discerning the principles of turtle and milfoil divination.

Turtle divination never invokes the milfoil divination of the *Changes*, nor does milfoil divination ever invoke turtle divination. Here, I set forth the evidence in detail.

#### Cases of Exclusive Turtle Divination Without Milfoil Divination

When Duke Hui of Jin was in Liang, the Lord of Liang married him to his daughter. Lady Liang of Liang was pregnant past her term, and they divined with turtle, consulting Zhao Fu and his son. The son said: "She will bear one boy and one girl." Zhao Fu said: "So it shall be. The boy will be a servant to others, and the girl will be a concubine." They named the boy Yu and the girl Qie. Later, when Yu was a hostage in Qin, Qie became a palace woman.

Duke Wen of Zhu divined about moving to Yi. The diviner said: "It will benefit the people but not the ruler." Duke Zhu said: "If it benefits the people, then let us move. Heaven gave birth to the people and set up a ruler for them to benefit them. If the people are benefited, I will surely share in it." After the move, Duke Zhu died.

The Marquis of Qi set a date for his army’s campaign, intending to attack Lu, but he fell ill. The physician said: "He will not live to autumn; he will die." When Duke Wen of Lu heard this, he divined with turtle, and the omen said: "He will not live to the appointed time." Shu Zhong Huibo commanded the turtle, and the diviner of Chuqiu interpreted it, saying: "The Marquis of Qi will not live to the appointed time—it is not illness. You, my lord, will also not hear of it, but now the turtle bears fault." Later, Duke Yi of Qi was assassinated, Duke Wen of Lu died first, and Huibo also perished.

The King of Chu and the Duke of She divined with turtle to appoint Ziliang as Prime Minister. Shen Yin Zhu said: "Auspicious, but it exceeds his aspirations." The Duke of She said: "A royal son serving as Prime Minister—what could exceed that?" Later, they divined again to appoint Ziguo as Prime Minister.

In these four cases, turtle divination was never accompanied by milfoil hexagram divination.

There were also cases of milfoil divination without turtle divination. Bi Wan divined his service in Jin and encountered *Tun* (屯) transforming into *Bi* (比). Xin Liao interpreted it, saying: "Auspicious. *Tun* firmly enters *Bi*—what greater fortune could there be? He will surely flourish and prosper. Thunder brings earth, the chariot follows the horse, feet settle upon it, the elder brother leads, the mother covers, the masses return—none of the six lines change, uniting to form stability. Secure yet capable of decisive action, this is the hexagram of dukes and marquises. The descendants of dukes and marquises will surely restore their ancestral beginnings." Later, when King Tai of Zhou attacked Jin, Tu Fu divined with milfoil and said: "Auspicious. Crossing the river, the marquis’s chariot will be defeated." When asked to explain, he replied: "This is most auspicious. Three defeats will surely capture the Lord of Jin." The hexagram encountered was *Gu* (蠱), and its *xuan* (縣) said: "A thousand chariots depart thrice; from the remnants of these three departures, the mighty fox is captured." The fox in *Gu* must be their lord. *Gu*’s primary trigram is wind, its changing trigram is mountain. The year has reached autumn; we strip its fruit and take its timber. With fruit fallen and timber gone, what awaits but defeat?" Three defeats later, they reached Han. The Lord of Jin intercepted the Qin army and fought at Hanyuan, where Qin captured the Lord of Jin and returned. When the Lord of Jin attacked Zheng and the Viscount of Chu came to Zheng’s aid, they met at Bi Ling. The Duke divined with milfoil, and the scribe said: "The warrior is stifled." The hexagram encountered was *Fu* (復), and he said: "The southern state is corrupt; shooting its kingless one, the arrow strikes his eye. The state stumbles, the king is wounded—what awaits but defeat?" In battle, Lü Qi shot King Gong of Chu in the eye. The king said: "Heaven has defeated Chu; I cannot remain." He then fled under cover of night. When Duke Xian of Jin divined the marriage of Bo Ji to Qin, he encountered *Guimei* (歸妹) transforming into *Kui* (睽). Historian Su interpreted it, saying: "Inauspicious." Its *xuan* said: "The warrior butchers the sheep, yet there is no blood; the woman carries the basket, yet there is no harvest. The western neighbor demands recompense—it cannot be repaid. *Guimei* transforming into *Kui* still lacks mutual support. Thunder and fire, fire and thunder—this is thunder, this is flame, this is the ruin of Bo Ji. The chariot sheds its shaft, fire burns its banner; it is inauspicious to march, defeat will come at Zongqiu. *Guimei* transforming into *Kui* is the drawn bow of bandits. The niece follows her aunt, six years will pass before reunion; she will flee back to her state and abandon her home." The next year, she died at the ruins of Gaoliang.

In these four cases, milfoil divination produced hexagrams, but there were no further turtle omen texts. Moreover, the *xuan* of the earlier three hexagrams—*Tun*, *Fu*, and *Gu*—were clearly not the words of the *Zhouyi*. The later *Guimei* transforming into *Kui* hexagram’s text was close to the *Zhouyi* but still not identical. From this, one may infer that the *Lianshan*, *Guicang*, and *Zhouyi* shared the same divination method but differed in their *xuan* texts.

There were also cases where both turtle and milfoil divination were used, each yielding its own text. When Cheng Ji of Lu was about to be born, Duke Huan sent the father of Chuqiu to divine with turtle. He said: "A son, his name will be You. He will stand at the Duke’s right, mediating between the two altars, and serve as the Duke’s assistant. If the Ji clan perishes, Lu will not prosper." They also divined with milfoil, encountering *Dayou* (大有) transforming into *Qian* (乾), and the text said: "Reuniting with the father, reverence as if before the lord." At birth, there was a mark on his hand reading *you* (友), so they named him accordingly. In such cases, both turtle and milfoil divination had their own texts, and the hexagram texts were not those of the *Zhouyi*.

There were also cases of first turtle divination, then milfoil divination. When Duke Xian of Jin wished to make Li Ji his lady, he divined with turtle, which was inauspicious; then with milfoil, which was auspicious. The Duke said: "Follow the milfoil." The turtle diviner said: "Milfoil is short, turtle is long—better to follow the long. Moreover, its *xuan* says: 'Devotion turns to betrayal, seizing the Duke’s robe. One whiff of fragrance, one of stench—ten years later, the stench still lingers.' It must not be done." He did not listen and established her.

She gave birth to Xi Qi. Then she secretly plotted against Crown Prince Shen Sheng until he hanged himself, and Xi Qi was established as heir. In the end, Jin fell into chaos.

There were also cases of first milfoil divination, then turtle divination. The Lord of Wei dreamed at the Northern Palace of a man ascending the tower of Kunwu, his hair disheveled as he cried out: *"I climb this ruined mound of Kunwu, where melons grow in endless vines. I am Hun Liangfu—how I have deceived Heaven and wronged the innocent!"* The Lord personally performed milfoil divination, and Xu Mi She interpreted it, saying: "It will bring no harm." The Lord then performed a proper turtle divination, and the *xuan* said: *"Like a fish peeking at its tail, drifting sideways in the current. A great state from the distant borders will destroy it—annihilation approaches. Seal the gates, block the holes, and perish from behind."* In the winter of the tenth month, Jin attacked Wei again, breaching its outer walls. Wei expelled Duke Zhuang and made peace with Jin, whereupon Jin installed Ban Shi, grandson of Duke Xiang, and withdrew.

In these two cases—whether first turtle then milfoil, or first milfoil then turtle—the milfoil divination had no hexagram texts, while the turtle divination had *xuan*. Yet whether by turtle or milfoil, the outcomes were not aligned but proved the same.

Another instance: When Duke Xian of Jin divined about attacking the Lirong, Historian Su interpreted the omens, saying: "Victory, but not auspicious." The Duke asked: "What do you mean?" He replied: "The omen reads: *'Clutching a bone in its jaws, fangs turned to treachery. Rong and Xia clash in strife—each claims victory.'* Hence my words. Moreover, I fear there will be mouths to feed, as private ambition swells within the state."

The Duke asked: "What mouths could there be? The mouths are mine to command—I shall not heed them. Who would dare rise against me?"
He replied: "If one can sway the people’s allegiance, they will gladly embrace deceit, unaware of how it may be stemmed. Once unleashed, how can it be dammed?"
The Duke did not listen. He attacked the Lirong, conquered them, and brought back Lady Li, ultimately plunging the state into chaos.

In such cases, divination relied solely on turtle *xuan* without milfoil hexagrams, as recorded in *Discourses of the States*, where the wording still closely aligns with *Zuo’s Commentary*. Yet in *The School Sayings of Confucius*, it is said that Confucius once cast milfoil and obtained the hexagram *Bi* (*Adornment*), his expression turning grim with discontent. Zizhang stepped forward and asked: "The diviner obtained *Bi*—a auspicious hexagram. Why then does the Master appear displeased?"
Confucius replied: "Because of its *li* (clinging fire). In the *Zhou Changes*, fire beneath the mountain forms *Bi*—a hexagram not of true colors. For substance, black and white should be pure. This *Bi* is not my omen. I have heard that cinnabar and lacquer need no embellishment, nor white jade carving. Why? Because their essence is already full—they require no adornment."

Looking at this account, doubts arise. If it claims Confucius himself cast the milfoil, why does Zizhang refer to it as divination? Moreover, the wording does not resemble the *Changes*. The *Image* of *Bi* states: "*Bi*: The yielding comes to adorn the firm. Dividing the firm above to adorn the yielding below—thus there is slight advantage in proceeding. The patterns of heaven; the civilizing of humanity. Observe the patterns of heaven to discern the changes of the times; observe the civilizing of humanity to transform and perfect the world." Why would the Master, who draws on the *Image* for its cultural refinement, reject adornment in milfoil divination alone? Such contradictions are glaring. Thus, I dare not trust *The School Sayings*.

As for Zuo Qiuming’s inclusion of milfoil divination without turtle in his *Commentary*, such instances are too numerous to list, all interpreted through the *Zhou Changes*. The *Zhou Changes* has endured to this day, its texts universally known. Beyond this single case in *The School Sayings*, turtle divination relied on *gui* omens, while milfoil used hexagrams—never were they confused.

Moreover, the *Rites* confirms that the *Lian Shan*, *Gui Cang*, and *Zhou Changes* form the Three Changes, each with eight primary hexagrams and sixty-four derived ones. Though the *Lian Shan* and *Gui Cang* are now lost, traces remain. How could they resemble later vulgar practices that conflate milfoil divination with turtle divination?

Some argue that the *Book of Changes* survived Qin’s burning of the books because it was entangled with divination and omens. Yet if the Grand Diviner’s *gui* omens numbered one hundred twenty, with a thousand two hundred *song* chants—none of which survive—how could divination texts alone escape the flames?

When Emperor Wen of Han journeyed from Dai, he divined and obtained the *Great Horizontal* omen. The *xuan* read: "*Great Horizontal*, *genggeng*—I shall be Heaven’s king, as Xia Qi brought glory." Interpreters said the *Great Horizontal* was the primary horizontal line of the turtle’s pattern, symbolizing the ruler’s earthly mandate. Thus, Han’s early divinations seemed to persist, though later ages lost them. Only when Gao Yang of Northern Qi sought to usurp Eastern Wei did he consult Li Mi, who also cited the *Great Horizontal*, calling it "the omen of Emperor Wen of Han." In my view, Li Mi merely flattered Gao Yang to aid his usurpation. How could such claims be fully trusted?

The later ages saw no trace of divination texts—why so? Alas! Their structure comprised three hundred sixty lines, and their *song* chants numbered three thousand six hundred in abundance; no wonder they did not survive. Had they endured, who could have mastered them?

How to demonstrate this? The *Lianshan* and *Guizang* have long vanished from the world, leaving only the *Zhouyi* (*Book of Changes*), whose hexagrams number a mere sixty-four, and whose lines total no more than three hundred eighty-four. Yet through the works and transmissions of the Three Eras and Four Sages, it remains unparalleled in its precision, adaptability, and near-divine application. As for the trigrams and their variations, they are defined solely by their words—hence the profusion of commentaries. But when asked about the specific changes in divination and where they lead, one is met with bewilderment: truly, no one knows what they signify. How then can one speak of the *Yi* with such certainty? It is difficult indeed.

Thus, in discussing the impossibility of conflating divination methods, I cannot but sigh deeply over these matters.

The hexagrams: The sage perceived the traces of the world and modeled them in form, symbolizing their proper correspondences—hence they are called *images*. The sage observed the movements of the world and contemplated their convergence and flow, enacting rituals accordingly. By appending words, he determined fortune and misfortune—hence they are called *lines*.

The utmost of the world’s traces resides in the hexagrams;
The impetus of the world’s movements resides in the words;
Transformation and裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁裁 reside in change;
Advancing and enacting them resides in penetration.

Thus, change and penetration serve to exhaust all advantages; penetrating change serves to complete the pattern.

The eight trigrams form their array, and the images lie within;
By doubling them, the lines lie within;
Hard and soft interact, and change lies within;
Appending words to them, movement lies within.

The eight trigrams convey through images;
The lines and images speak through circumstance;
Change and penetration speak through advantage;
Fortune and misfortune shift with circumstance.

It is also said: The lines and images move within, while fortune and misfortune appear without; achievements manifest through change, and the sage’s intent is revealed in the words.

Since it is said that the impetus of the world’s movements resides in the words, and that appending words to command them places movement within, it follows that appending words determines fortune and misfortune. To discern fortune and misfortune is to rely on the words—thus, words are indispensable to the Dao of the *Yi*.

Therefore, the *Yi* as a book embodies a Dao that shifts repeatedly, never fixed, flowing through the six positions, rising and falling without constancy. Hard and soft alternate, defying rigid principles—only change dictates its course.

Hexagrams vary in scale, and words vary in peril or ease. The words, then, each point to their destination.

Yet that single character "之" (*zhi*, "to go") specifically indicates the direction of change and movement. *Yi* means "change," and it is through this that the world’s movements are observed and impelled. Nothing escapes this scrutiny.

Thus, the divination of the *Yi* refers to the lines changing and moving, each finding its proper place, becoming such-and-such a hexagram within such-and-such a hexagram. Today, what is called "the words pointing to their destination" is termed the "hexagram’s manifestation."

Han Kangbo provided no annotation for this "pointing to its destination." Kong Yingda’s subcommentary states: "Each points to its destination," meaning the words of the lines and hexagrams each specify where their respective line or hexagram is headed. If it heads toward good, the words are good; if toward evil, the words are evil—nothing more.

To gloss *zhi* as "to go" is not incorrect, but to say that the hexagram’s change or the line’s movement is sufficient to clarify where the words lead is inadequate. Let us also illustrate this with the *Zuozhuan*:

In Chen Jingzhong’s youth, a Zhou historian visited Chen Hou with the *Zhouyi* and divined for him, obtaining *Guan* (Observation) changing to *Pi* (Stagnation)—specifically, the fourth line of *Guan* changing to the fourth line of *Pi*. Thus, the historian pointed to the words of *Guan*’s fourth line: *"Observe the state’s glory; it is advantageous to be a guest of the king."* From this, he knew Jingzhong would replace Chen as ruler.

When Duke Wen of Jin welcomed the king, he divined and obtained *Dayou* (Great Possession) changing to *Kui* (Dispersion)—specifically, the third line of *Dayou* changing to the third line of *Kui*. Thus, Bu Yan pointed to the words of *Dayou*’s third line: *"Auspicious—this is the hexagram of the duke offering sacrifice to the Son of Heaven. Victory in battle followed by the king’s feast—what greater fortune could there be?"* In *Dayou*’s nine in the third place, the *Yi* uses *xiang* (享, "offering") for *heng* (亨, "smooth"), though *heng* originally meant *ken* (垦, "to cultivate") and later *xiang* ("offering").

When Cui Zhu of Qi sought to marry Dongguo Jiang, the widow of Tang Gong, he divined and obtained *Kun* (Distress) changing to *Daguo* (Great Exceeding)—specifically, the third line of *Kun* changing to the third line of *Daguo*. The historians all declared it auspicious. When shown to Chen Wenzi, he pointed to the words of *Kun*’s third line: *"Following the wind, the wind topples the wife—she cannot be taken."* Moreover, its *xuan* text states: *"Distressed by stone, resting on thorns, entering his palace, not seeing his wife—misfortune."* He further explained: *"Distressed by stone"—to go is not to succeed. "Resting on thorns"—what one relies on is harmed. "Entering his palace, not seeing his wife"—misfortune, for there is nowhere to return.* Cui Zhu nevertheless married Tang Jiang, and his family was ultimately destroyed by chaos.

When Shusun Muzi was born, Zhuang Shu divined for him with the *Zhouyi* and obtained *Mingyi* (Bright Obscured) changing to *Qian* (Modesty)—specifically, the initial line of *Mingyi* changing to the initial line of *Qian*. Shown to Bu Chuqiu, he said: *"Bright but not yet radiant—it must be dawn."* The change to *Qian* corresponds to the crow, hence: *"Mingyi takes flight."* *"Bright but not yet radiant"*—hence: *"Drooping its wings."* The image of stirring in the waters—hence: *"The noble one goes on his way."*

When the three resides at dawn, hence: *"Three days without eating."* *Li* is fire; fire scorches the mountain and brings ruin. In man, it is speech; speech that brings ruin is slander—hence: *"There is somewhere to go; the host has words,"* and those words must be slander. This is the line statement of the initial line of *Mingyi*. In the end, he perished in the chaos of Jian Niu. Not a single divination failed to prove true.

Lady Xiang of Wei had no son. When the concubine Chou gave birth to Meng Zhi, Kong Chengzi dreamed that Kang Shu said to him: *"Establish Wu; I will send Ji’s grandson Yu to assist him, along with the scribe Gou."* Scribe Chao also dreamed that Kang Shu said to him: *"I command your son Gou and Kong Xu Niu’s great-grandson Yu to assist Wu."* Scribe Chao met Chengzi and told him. The dreams matched.

When Han Xuanzi was in office and making his rounds among the feudal lords, Chou gave birth to a son, whom he named Wu. Meng Zhi’s feet were not sound, and he could not walk well. Chengzi divined for him with the *Zhouyi* and said: *"Wu will still enjoy the state of Wei and preside over its altars."* He encountered *Zhun* changing to *Bi*. He also said: *"I will still establish Zhi, and he will surely be worthy."* He encountered *Zhun*. He showed it to Scribe Chao, who said: *"Supremely favorable—what limit could there be?"* Chengzi said: *"I do not mean he will be the eldest."* Chao said: *"Kang Shu commanded it—can that not be called eldest?"* Thus *Xian* says: *"Favorable to establish a lord."* *"Inheritance is auspicious"*—why establish? Establishment is not inheritance. Both hexagrams say *"the son shall establish him,"* and Kang Shu commanded it; both hexagrams informed him. Divination aligned with the dream—this was the method used by King Wu.

He twice encountered the hexagram statement of *Zhun*, both saying: *"Supremely favorable."* And *Zhun* changed at the initial line, hence to *Bi*. The line statement of the initial line of *Zhun* says: *"Wavering; favorable to dwell in constancy; favorable to establish a lord."* Thereupon they established Wu.

When Nan Kuai was about to rebel, he secretly divined and encountered *Kun* changing to *Bi*, which said: *"Yellow skirts—supremely auspicious."* He took it as highly favorable and showed it to Zifu Huibo, saying: *"If I were to take action, how would it be?"* Huibo said: *"I have studied this: if it is a matter of loyalty and good faith, it may succeed; otherwise, it will surely fail. Yellow is the color of the center; skirts are the adornment of the lower; none is the chief of good. If the center is not centered, it does not obtain its color; if the lower is not submissive, it does not obtain its adornment; if the matter is not good, it does not reach its utmost. Without these three, it is not fitting. Moreover, the *Yi* cannot be used to divine peril."*

This was because the fifth line of *Kun* changed to the fifth line of *Bi*, so he interpreted it with the line statement of the fifth line of *Kun*. Nan Kuai ultimately rebelled and perished. Thus, when examining these several cases and investigating the *Commentaries*, one finds many more instances, all explained by the hexagram to which they moved and the line that was activated.

The hexagram one encounters is the matter of divining change. The *Yi* contains the Dao of the sage—thus, in action, one values its changes; in divination, one values its prognostications. Hence, *"understanding change is called affairs,"* and *"exhausting numbers to know the future is called divination."* When divining affairs, there is the hexagram one encounters.

Yet the ancients who studied the *Yi* did not do so solely for divination. What the noble one dwells in and finds peace in is the sequence of the *Yi*; what he delights in and plays with are the line statements. At rest, he observes its images and plays with its words; in action, he observes its changes and plays with its prognostications. It is not only in divination that there is the hexagram one encounters. In all matters of the heart, in refining one’s thoughts, in the circumstances one meets, in the intentions one expresses, in extension and analogy—one has never failed to employ its hexagrams.

The Viscount of Chu besieged Zheng and conquered it. The Jin army came to rescue Zheng. Xun Huanzhi, hearing that Zheng had made peace with Chu, wished to return, saying: *"If we do not reach Zheng and exhaust the people, what use is it?"* Sui Wuzi said: *"Well said."* Ying Ji opposed it, and the deputy commander of the central army crossed the river. Zhi Zhuangzi said: *"This army is in peril."* The *Zhouyi* has this in *Shi* changing to *Lin*: *"The army goes forth with discipline; if not good, it is ominous."* This refers to the initial line of *Shi* changing to the initial line of *Lin*.

Zheng Youji returned from Chu and told Zizhan: *"The Viscount of Chu will die. He does not cultivate political virtue but greedily deludes the feudal lords to satisfy his desires—can he long endure?"* In *Fu* changing to *Yi*, it says: *"Deluded return—ominous."* Does this not refer to the Viscount of Chu? This refers to the top line of *Fu* changing to the top line of *Yi*.

Zheng Duke’s son Manman spoke with Prince Boliao, wishing to become minister. Boliao told others: *"Without virtue yet greedy—this is in the *Zhouyi* in *Feng* changing to *Li*. He will not pass beyond it."* This refers to the top line of *Feng* changing to the top line of *Li*. Its line statement says: *"Abundant is his house, secluded is his family, peering through his door, desolate and without people—three years without seeing them—ominous."* Within a year, the people of Zheng indeed killed him.

In these three cases, they did not go beyond citing the line of the hexagram to which it moved as the reason. As for Cai Mo’s response to Wei Xianzi’s question about the dragon appearing in the suburbs of Jiang, he simply said: *"The *Zhouyi* has this in *Qian* changing to *Gou*: *'The hidden dragon—do not act.'* In *Tongren*, it says: *'The dragon appears in the fields.'* In *Dayou*, it says: *'The flying dragon is in the heavens.'* In *Guai*, it says: *'The dragon at its zenith has regret.'* In *Kun*, it says: *'Seeing a grass dragon without a head—auspicious.'* In *Kun* changing to *Bo*, it says: *'Dragons battle in the wild.'"* Though in the images of dragons and the matter of real dragons, there may be inconsistencies in rational inquiry, the six lines he cited from *Qian* and *Kun* were all mutually compared with the line statements of *Qian* and *Kun* in reverse, clarifying the hexagram to which they moved. This is to say that of the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Yi* and their three hundred eighty-four lines, the changes to which they move generally follow this method.

This suffices to elucidate the words of the *Great Commentary* on the *Yi*: each points to its specific destination, not being established for other purposes, but for the hexagrams themselves. This is precisely how one observes the movements of the world beneath Heaven, contemplates their convergence and interpenetration, and thereby conducts its rituals and decrees, determining fortune and misfortune. Transforming and裁ing it, extending and enacting it—only the direction of change matters. The direction of change refers to the hexagram to which it moves. Thus it is said: "The movement of line-images arises within; fortune and misfortune manifest without. Achievement and enterprise are revealed through change; the sentiments of the sage are seen in the words." Hexagrams have great and small; words have peril and ease. The words, then, each point to their specific destination. Scholars rely on this to carefully observe change and establish hexagrams, leaning on numbers to generate lines. They delve into the profound to reach the utmost refinement, investigate the subtle to grasp the utmost change, and so attain the utmost spirit, harmonizing with the Dao/virtue and ordering through righteousness. They exhaust principle and fulfill nature to reach destiny, their minds encompassing the entire *Yi* in both substance and function—this is the ultimate attainment.

*Yi Divination and the Pervasion of Change, Scroll the First* concludes.

---

The *Yi* begins with the strokes of yin and yang, where yang’s stroke becomes odd and yin’s stroke becomes even. From the strokes of *Qian*, they divide to form the odd hexagrams *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*; from *Kun*, they divide to form the even hexagrams *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*. Thus it is said: yang hexagrams are odd, yin hexagrams are even; yang hexagrams contain more yin, yin hexagrams contain more yang. Though the odd and even, the few and the many, may seem calculable, they were never originally called nine or six.

When the sages created the *Yi*, observing change in yin and yang to establish hexagrams, the Dao/Way of Heaven was called yin and yang; unfolding through hardness and softness to generate lines, the Dao/Way of Earth was called softness and hardness. Thus the *Yi* forms hexagrams with six strokes, dividing yin and yang, alternately employing softness and hardness, with six positions forming a pattern. What is called "stroke" and "position" refers to the hexagrams and lines. How could there ever have been a division into nine and six?

Yet when the strokes and positions of the doubled *Qian* hexagram are all yang-odd lines, the line statements invariably attach "nine," and there is even the precedent of "using nine." When the strokes and positions of the doubled *Kun* hexagram are all yin-even lines, the line statements invariably attach "six," and there is even the precedent of "using six." Moreover, the lines of every hexagram invariably attach "nine" or "six." Scholars, habituated to what they have seen and heard, take this as truly being nine and six. From this, the origin of nine and six is no longer questioned—I privately find this strange.

Nine and six are numbers. The *Great Commentary* says: "Exhausting numbers to know the future is called divination; pervading change is called affairs." Now, nine and six pertain to the affairs of divination and change. It begins with the alternation of threes and fives, interweaving their numbers. The numbers of Heaven are five; the numbers of Earth are five. The numbers of Heaven sum to twenty-five; the numbers of Earth sum to thirty. Altogether, the numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty-five, through which transformations are accomplished and the spirits are set in motion—yet they were never originally called nine or six.

From the numbers of Heaven—one, three, five, seven, nine—we know their sum is twenty-five. From the numbers of Earth—two, four, six, eight, ten—we know their sum is thirty. When the five positions mutually correspond, each having its pair, the numbers before five are called generating numbers, and those after five are called completing numbers. Thus one pairs with six to signify water; two pairs with seven to signify metal; three pairs with eight to signify wood; four pairs with nine to signify fire; five pairs with the void ten to signify earth. Here, nine and six emerge in their midst, though their use has not yet been made manifest.

The numbers before the five positions are their generative aspects; the numbers after the five positions are their functional aspects. The generative aspect of the body: Heaven-one, Heaven-three, and Heaven-five are combined to make nine; Earth-two and Earth-four are doubled to make six. Leaning on the numbers of three Heavens and two Earths, three threes make nine, and three twos make six—thus nine and six uniquely initiate their function.

Therefore, one and four are arrayed in fives; two and three are arrayed in fives. Five, when combined, makes five—this is the beginning of the alternation of threes and fives. Then one arrays with five to make six; two arrays with five to make seven; three arrays with five to make eight; four arrays with five to make nine; the void five arrays to make ten. Thus five combines with ten to make fifteen; seven combines with eight to make fifteen; nine combines with six to make fifteen—this is what is meant by "alternating threes and fives, interweaving their numbers."

All the numbers nine, six, seven, and eight equally attain completion through the completing numbers of Earth, thereby generating the generative numbers of Heaven—this is what is called "forming images." Thus one with five makes six as old yin; two with five makes seven as young yang; three with five makes eight as young yin; four with five makes nine as old yang. Nine, six, seven, and eight are mutually transformed in their use. Though the world knows that the young of yin and yang do not change, while the old do change...

Yet what is commonly observed in the diagrams throughout the *Book of Changes*—where the lines of the hexagrams, the odd as yang, are appended below with "nine," and the even as yin, are appended below with "six"—obscures the fact that the yang line is fundamentally seven, and the yin line fundamentally eight.

How is this made clear? The *Changes* means "transformation"; "exhausting numbers to know the future" is called divination, and "penetrating transformation" is called affairs. It is said that the affairs of divination and transformation follow the method of the milfoil stalks: four operations complete the *Changes*, and eighteen changes complete a hexagram. Every three changes accumulate into one line, with four and eight serving as the odd and even. When each set of three changes yields one, four, two, and eight, they form the image of *Zhen* (☳), *Kan* (☵), and *Gen* (☶), all drawn as the odd line (⚊). When each set of three changes yields one, eight, two, and four, they form the image of *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱), all drawn as the even line (⚋). This embodies the idea of yin and yang seeking each other to generate the six children. When three changes all yield four, the line is drawn as ⚊ to image *Qian* (☰); when three changes all yield eight, the line is drawn as ⚋ to image *Kun* (☷). The accumulation of one, four, two, and eight into a fixed line is called seven; the accumulation of one, eight, two, and four into a fixed line is called eight—these two are the unchanging ones. Only when three changes yield pure four is it called the extreme of yang odd, the moving line of ⚊, called nine; when three changes yield pure eight, it is called the extreme of yin even, the moving line of ⚋, called six—these two are the changing ones.

All the fixed lines of odd and even, which are exhaustively listed at the beginning of each hexagram, do not take their movement but specifically mark the body of hardness and softness, remaining unchanged to form the fixed hexagram. As for the changing lines of nine and six, which are intermingled within each hexagram, they are not listed in the diagram but specifically lodge the function of yin and yang, adapting to change and movement to form the hexagram—this is what is meant by "using nine" and "using six." The *Qianzao Du* states: "Yang moves and advances; yin moves and retreats." Thus yang takes seven and yin takes eight as their images; yang transforms seven into nine, and yin transforms eight into six.

Chao Yuezhi expounded in terms of the Dao: "In ancient times, the odd and even of hexagram lines represented yin and yang, and the hexagram lines had only six positions without the names seven and eight. Following the milfoil divination of the *Changes*, the old yang changes to nine, the old yin changes to six, the young yang changes to seven, and the young yin changes to eight. The seven and eight of the *Zhou Changes* are the ancient odd and even. When the nine and six of the *Changes*’ divination appear in the hexagram text, they transform accordingly. If all six positions are nine, it becomes *Kun* from *Qian*; if all six positions are six, it becomes *Qian* from *Kun*. This is the example of 'using nine' and 'using six,' which suffices to clarify the matter. What I have seen is universally the same.

Now, what is recorded in the *Zuozhuan* can further elucidate this, and there are instances where one cannot but examine the errors in its annotations. When Lady Mu Jiang of Lu was about to die in the Eastern Palace, she first went and divined, encountering *Gen* changing to eight. The scribe said: "This is called *Gen* changing to *Sui*." "Following it, the lord will swiftly depart." Jiang said: "Perish. As for the *Zhou Changes*, it says: '*Sui*: origin, prosperity, benefit, and perseverance—no blame.' Origin is the leader of the body; prosperity is the gathering of excellence; benefit and perseverance are the backbone of affairs. Embracing benevolence suffices to lead others; gathering excellence suffices to accord with ritual; benefiting things suffices to harmonize righteousness; being steadfast suffices to manage affairs. Yet this cannot be deceived, which is why even *Sui* has no blame. Now I, a woman, have partaken in disorder—this cannot be called 'no blame.' Not pacifying the state—this cannot be called 'prosperity.' Acting to harm myself—this cannot be called 'benefit.' Abandoning my position and being licentious—this cannot be called 'perseverance.' One who possesses these four virtues may follow *Sui* without blame. I possess none of them—how can this be *Sui*? I will incur misfortune; if I act and bring harm, how can there be no blame? I will surely die in this palace and not depart."

Thus, this divination of *Gen* changing to eight further confirms that seven and eight are the fixed lines, not the moving lines of nine and six, and the annotation is mistaken. The *Rites of Zhou* states that the Grand Diviner oversees the three *Changes* to perform the nine divinations, namely *Lianshan*, *Guicang*, and *Zhouyi*, saying that their primary hexagrams are all eight, and their derivations are all sixty-four. Though the *Changes* have three names, the divination follows a single method. Taking seven and eight as the body of the hexagram lines and nine and six as the function of the hexagram lines is why it is called *Gen* changing to eight. The changes of *Gen* are: the first line to *Bi* (☷→☲), the third line to *Bo* (☷→☷), the fourth line to *Lü* (☷→☴), the fifth line to *Jian* (☷→☴), and the top line to *Qian* (☷→☶). This clarifies that the divination pertains to the single hexagram *Gen*, where all six lines have already changed except one. The five hexagrams to which it changes are also five. The scribe viewed them indiscriminately, unable to decide on the judgment. Only the second line, being an unchanging yin even, had nowhere to transform, so he reversed the judgment to *Gen* changing to *Sui*.

Moreover, examining the divination, he said: "*Sui*—following it, the lord will swiftly depart." Jiang then self-examined and found nothing to match the virtues of this hexagram. Thus, she said: "As for the *Zhou Changes*, it says: '*Sui*: origin, prosperity, benefit, and perseverance—no blame.'"

In elaborating this interpretation, as stated above—when did he ever cite the *Lian Shan* or *Gui Zang* versions of the *Changes*, let alone perform another divination? Du [You] failed to comprehend the divination method of the *Zhou Changes*. The fundamental lines of yin pairs are but eight, yet he rashly pointed to the two *Changes* [i.e., *Lian Shan* and *Gui Zang*] as using seven and eight for prognostication. Moreover, he claimed that when the scribe hesitated over an *Changes* divination encountering eight, it was deemed inauspicious, and thus resorted to the *Zhou Changes* to assess the changing lines—how grievously mistaken! From today’s perspective, it is abundantly clear that seven and eight constitute the completed lines of a hexagram, not yet named nine or six.

The *Guo Yu* records that Duke Chong’er of Jin divined whether he would ascend to the rulership of Jin. He obtained the primary hexagram *Zhun* (☳) and the secondary *Yu* (☳→☷), both with eight. Wei Zhao’s commentary explains: In *Zhun*, *Zhen* (☳) is the inner trigram, and its two yin lines remain unchanging; in *Yu*, *Zhen* is the outer trigram, and its two yin lines likewise remain unchanging—hence both are called eight. This serves as evidence. Later, Dong Yin divined again and obtained *Tai* (☰→☷) with eight. Zhao’s commentary notes: *Tai* has no moving lines, and its yin lines remain unchanging, their number being eight—thus all unchanging yin pairs are counted as eight. This further confirms the principle. If unchanging yin pairs are eight, then unchanging yang lines must be seven—this is self-evidently clear.

Yet in the entire corpus of the *Changes*, seven and eight are nowhere to be found; only nine and six appear. Scholars blindly follow the usage of "nine" and "six" in the text, failing to grasp the rationale behind their application. The confusion persists, as previously discussed, because the lines are established for the hexagrams. All instances in the *Zuozhuan* where it states "hexagram X changes to hexagram Y" refer to the movement of lines and their transformations, indicating the direction of change. This is what is meant by "only transformation determines the outcome." For the diviner, the prognostication hinges on the reading; for the moving line, the transformation is paramount. The term "line" (*yao*) speaks to its mutability. The sage perceived the movements of the world and observed their convergence and flow, thereby instituting rituals. He appended judgments to determine fortune or misfortune—hence the term "line." It signifies the world’s movements, which must not be disordered. Thus it is said: "The meaning of the six lines is easily proclaimed."

Upon close examination, the fixed lines are inherently seven and eight. When they move, seven advances to nine, embodying yang within yin, while eight recedes to six, embodying yin within yang. The *Commentary* on divination and the changing lines of hexagrams consistently adheres to this principle, as clearly demonstrated in Cai Mo’s response to Wei Xianzi’s inquiry about the dragon. It states: "The *Zhou Changes* contains this in *Qian* changing to *Gou* (☰→☱): 'The hidden dragon—do not act.' In *Tong Ren* (☰→☲), it says: 'The dragon appears in the field.' In *Da You* (☰→☲), it says: 'The dragon soars in the heavens.' In *Guai* (☰→☱), it says: 'The dragon exalts itself—there will be regret.' In *Kun* (☷), it says: 'See the crawling dragon without a head—auspicious.' In *Kun* changing to *Bo* (☷→☶), it says: 'Dragons battle in the wild.'" This suffices to show that only when seven and eight move and transform do they become nine and six. Otherwise, the lines of *Qian* would uniformly be called nine, with their judgments distributed as "hidden dragon—do not act," and so forth, while the top line of *Kun* would simply state "dragons battle in the wild." Why then enumerate *Qian* changing to *Gou* or *Kun* changing to *Bo* before citing the judgments beneath the original lines of nine and six to illustrate the pattern? Moreover, beneath the "use of nine" in the *Qian* hexagram, it states: "See the group of dragons without a head—auspicious." Yet Cai Mo specifically refers to it as *Kun* before interpreting it as such. This demonstrates that the "use of nine" as a changing line universally applies without exception, so evident that it requires no further elaboration.

The reason each line first cites the original hexagram before invoking its judgment is to show that seven’s transformation advances to nine, while eight’s transformation recedes to six. Scrutinizing the *Commentary*, every judgment cited for a hexagram reveals that a line is called nine or six only after seven or eight moves and transforms. Hence the conventions of "using nine" and "using six"—this is the application of nine and six. From the first to the top line of *Qian*, all must await the movement of yang’s seven before becoming nine; from the first to the top line of *Kun*, all must await the movement of yin’s eight before becoming six. As Chao [Yuezhi] stated: When nine and six appear in the lines of a hexagram, all six positions changing to nine becomes *Qian* changing to *Kun*, while all six positions changing to six becomes *Kun* changing to *Qian*. The *Qian Zaodu* reiterates this: "Yang moves and advances, transforming seven into nine, symbolizing the growth of qi; yin moves and recedes, transforming eight into six, symbolizing the waning of qi." It further states: "*Qian* wanes through thirty-two generations, *Kun* waxes through thirty-two generations." Thus the *Great Commentary* of the *Changes* says: "Are *Qian* and *Kun* not the gateway of the *Changes*?" All vessels (*min*) arise from the gateway of *Qian* and *Kun*. Every hexagram follows this pattern to achieve coherence, and only through transformation do lines acquire the names nine and six. Therefore, the "use of nine" and "use of six" appear exclusively in *Qian* and *Kun*, not in other hexagrams. The vessels are not established solely for *Qian* and *Kun*; the emperor applies their principles universally to all hexagrams.

Thus, in divination practice, when none of the six lines change, the judgment is made according to the *Image* statement of the original hexagram. When five lines change and only one remains unchanged, the judgment is made according to the *Image* statement of the unchanging line in the resultant hexagram, rather than its line statement, for since the line does not move, it cannot be named nine or six.

Ouyang Yongshu asked: "*Qian* says 'use nine,' and *Kun* says 'use six'—what does this mean?" The answer: "It explains why seven and eight are not used." In *Qian*, the lines are seven and nine, and nine transforms; in *Kun*, the lines are eight and six, and six transforms. The *Changes* employs transformation for divination, hence naming the lines accordingly.

Zhu Yuanhui greatly praised this explanation, adding: "*Qian* and *Kun* use nine and six—what does this mean?" The answer: "In *Qian*, the lines are seven and nine; in *Kun*, they are six and eight. Nine and six transform, while seven and eight remain unchanging. The Dao of the *Changes* divines by transformation, thus naming the lines for the diviner, not because all six lines are nine or six. In divination, sevens and eights are commonly numerous, while nines and sixes are few. When no nine or six appears, it must still be explained. This holds true for all sixty-four hexagrams, though it is only explicitly stated in *Qian* and *Kun*—the rest may be inferred. Moreover, this explanation clarifies what earlier scholars had not reached, making it most valuable."

The observation that sevens and eights are many while nines and sixes are few also reflects the divination method of his time, where three changes determined the hexagram, as described by Yixing. Yet in my humble view, Zhu’s account only echoes the explanations of Ouyang and Chao, which Zhu himself may not have seen. As for works like the *Qianzao Du*, scholars dismiss them as *Apocrypha of the Changes*, not only ignoring them but even refusing to read them, unaware of their value for reference. Comparing ancient and modern views, one finds that while some insights align without seeking agreement, all fall short of explaining the *reason* for nine and six.

Take the *Zuozhuan*, which records hexagrams and their verifications, treating the *Changes* as lacking concrete affairs and thus preserving detailed accounts. Yet when Chao examined the hexagrams and saw nine and six but not seven and eight, he merely raised doubts, not truly understanding nine and six.

Carefully considering the *Shuogua*: "In ancient times, the sages created the *Changes*, assisting the numinous and bright to generate the milfoil stalks"—this clearly establishes the method of divination. "They reckoned by thrice heaven and twice earth, relying on numbers": multiplying three thrice yields nine, corresponding to heaven (*Qian*’s "use nine"), and multiplying two thrice yields six, corresponding to earth (*Kun*’s "use six"). Thus begins the use of nine and six.

"Observing changes in yin and yang to establish hexagrams" refers to what is called: "The Dao of heaven is yin and yang; the Dao of earth is soft and hard; the Dao of humanity is benevolence and righteousness." Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, the *Changes* forms hexagrams with six lines, clearly marking the odd and even at the hexagram’s head. The unchanging lines are fixed as seven and eight.

"Expressing through hardness and softness to generate lines": lines differ from positions. Before changing, a moving line is called a position; once moved and transformed, it becomes a line. Thus, the *Changes* forms patterns with six positions. These six positions in a hexagram, from bottom to top, divide yin and yang, alternately employing hardness and softness. They do not remain fixed but circulate through the six voids, with no constant above or below. Hard and soft replace each other, following only where change leads. Some reckon by heaven and become nine; some reckon by earth and become six. "Use nine" and "use six" are how nine and six transform within each line, thereby generating the resultant hexagram. What doubt can there be about nine and six?

The sages perceived the traces of the world and its movements, modeled them in form, observed their convergence and communication, and struck forth words to determine fortune or misfortune. Thus, they formed patterns. Their words in the *Changes* are simple yet principle-laden, illuminating for all under heaven and later generations. Yet scholars grasp only the names, not the reality, following them all their lives without understanding. Doubts give rise to explanations, each claiming unique insight and setting forth their own theories—how lamentable!

Therefore, I have here particularly expounded upon this.

**Yi Shi Tong Bian, Volume Three**
*Studied and Expanded by Daoist Lei Siqi of Linchuan*

**Derivation of Numbers**

The numbers of heaven and earth total fifty-five: the heavenly numbers—one, three, five, seven, nine—sum to twenty-five, while the earthly numbers—two, four, six, eight, ten—sum to thirty. Ought this not be so? Yet it is emphatically impossible to add or subtract from them, yet the *Great Expansion*’s number abruptly reduces by five, calling it specifically fifty. Thus, seeking its principle yields no answer, verifying its sum brings no accord, and none can grasp its origin. People all offer explanations, each claiming semblance of reason, yet none ever attain its true essence—such was the case in antiquity as it is today.

The *Liezi* is a text Confucians dismiss through rote transmission, refusing to accept or even examine it. Yet its opening chapter states: "The sages governed heaven and earth through yin and yang." If form arises from the formless, whence do heaven and earth originate? Thus it says: There is *Taiyi* (Grand Simplicity), *Taichu* (Grand Beginning), *Taishi* (Grand Commencement), and *Taisu* (Grand Simplicity of Substance). *Taiyi* is that which has not yet manifested qi; *Taichu* is the beginning of qi; *Taishi* is the beginning of form; *Taisu* is the beginning of substance. When qi, form, and substance are complete yet undifferentiated, it is called *hunlun* (chaotic wholeness). *Hunlun* signifies the myriad things intermingled and undivided—hence it is called *yi* (change). *Yi* transforms into *One*, and *One* is the beginning of form’s transformation.

This doctrine reappears in the *Qian Zaodu* of the *Yi Wei*, which likewise affirms it. From this perspective, the *Yi*’s *Taiji* (Supreme Polarity) is but a borrowed term for *hunlun*. Above *hunlun*, there are four designations—*yi*, *chu*, *shi*, and *su*—and with *hunlun* itself, five in total. Thus, *hunlun* is called *Taiji*, forming the "Five Ultimates." Here, *Taiji* already contains these five within it. Therefore, while the numbers of heaven and earth total fifty-five, the *Great Expansion*’s number is fifty, having voided the five above *Taiji* to employ the marvel of fifty.

The *Great Commentary* states: "Generation upon generation is called *yi*; forming images is called *Qian*; modeling patterns is called *Kun*; exhausting numbers to know the future is called divination; penetrating change is called affairs; the unfathomable of yin and yang is called the numinous." This is precisely its meaning. From this, we know the *Yi*’s *Taiji* as *One*, and *One* as the beginning of form’s transformation.

Yet while the *Yi* is said to have *Taiji*, it is also called "generation upon generation is *yi*," immediately followed by "forming images is *Qian*"—without mention of *Taiji*. Why? This is because those who fail to comprehend the *Yi* do not grasp that it fundamentally unites yin and yang, while *Taiji* is merely the convergence of their transformations. Thus it is said: "*Yi* transforms into *One*, and *One* is the beginning of form’s transformation." The *Yi* establishes *One* through *Taiji* to signify "forming images is *Qian*," which is the beginning of form’s transformation—hence it is called *One*.

From *Qian*, *One* divides into *Two*, thereby initiating *Kun*. The unused one in the *Great Expansion*’s fifty symbolizes the *Yi*’s *Taiji*. Its division into *Two* represents the Two Modes. That *Two* is not called "two" but "symbolizing the Two Modes" precisely reflects *One*’s division. Thus, in the *Great Expansion*’s fifty, the unused *Taiji* is first revered as the root of generation. The use of forty-nine arises from *One*’s division into *Two*: one generates the Two Modes, splitting into two to symbolize them. Then, one is further apportioned to embody the Way of the Three Powers, suspending one to symbolize the Three. One is again divided into the Four Images, establishing the distinctions of north, south, east, and west; the sequence of winter, summer, spring, and autumn; and the positions of water, fire, wood, and metal—all manifesting through this. Thus, the fourfold division to symbolize the four seasons corresponds to the *Hetu*’s number of forty.

Yet the numbers of heaven and earth total fifty-five, while the *Great Expansion*’s number is fifty. Heaven’s five has no position among the Four Images, and earth’s ten has no place in the Eight Trigrams—why such stark discrepancy? Heaven’s five, though numbered, lacks a position: the ancient form of "five" (五) resembles intersecting lines (×), while its modern form (五) reveals yin-yang’s alternation within *Two* to constitute five, with ten’s form also prefigured here. Five is inherently earth, and earth’s character (土) is ten and one—beginning with one, centering on five, culminating in ten, and returning to one. Earth also lacks a fixed position, hence the Four Images exclude five, and the Eight Trigrams exclude ten.

I have long pondered the origin of heaven and earth’s fifty-five. The Four Images’ one, two, three, and four generate the Eight Trigrams by reapplying one, two, three, and four, each augmented by five to become six, seven, eight, and nine—totaling forty-eight. The trigrams’ one and nine, two and eight, three and seven, four and six intersect, and their sums likewise total forty, never assigning fixed positions to heaven’s five or earth’s ten. Precisely because heaven’s five and earth’s ten multiply to form the *Great Expansion*’s fifty.

How to elucidate this? The marvelous function of five and ten: pairing the one of Kan in the north with five to form six, yielding Qian in the northwest; pairing the three of Zhen in the east with five to form eight, yielding Gen in the northeast—here, the cardinal directions take precedence, the oblique positions follow. Pairing the two of Kun in the southwest with five to form seven, yielding Dui in the west; pairing the four of Xun in the southeast with five to form nine, yielding Li in the due south—here, the oblique positions take precedence, the cardinal directions follow. Thus, yang’s odd numbers gain five to become yin’s even numbers, and yin’s even numbers gain five to become yang’s odd numbers, by which yin and yang are divided and the Eight Trigrams arrayed.

As for the function of ten: multiplying the nine of Li in the south to pair with and exchange ten for the one of Kan in the north—yang numbers self-exchange within yang, each establishing its cardinal direction. Multiplying the seven of Dui in the west to pair with and exchange ten for the three of Zhen in the east—yin numbers self-exchange within yin, each settling into its oblique position. Leaving five vacant at the center, all become variations of fifteen. Thus, hardness and softness grind against each other, the Eight Trigrams surge and interlock, transforming and flowing, extending and enacting—revealing the singular function of heaven’s five and earth’s ten.

Therefore, in divination with milfoil stalks, four must be used to symbolize the four seasons. The function of five and ten lies precisely here. The reason for manipulating them with four is this: five unites the one, two, three, and four above, while ten unites the six, seven, eight, and nine below. This clarifies how five, combined with heaven’s one, forms six—four times six makes twenty-four, the count for old yin Kun; five combined with earth’s two forms seven—four times seven makes twenty-eight, the count for young yang Zhen, Kan, and Gen; five combined with heaven’s three forms eight—four times eight makes thirty-two, the count for young yin Xun, Li, and Dui; five combined with earth’s four forms nine—four times nine makes thirty-six, the count for old yang Qian. Thus, the unchanging seven and eight of young yin and yang combine to make fifteen, forming the lines of the hexagrams; the changing nine and six of old yin and yang also combine to make fifteen, forming the moving lines of the hexagrams. The *Changes*’ transformations correspond to the four seasons, hence four times four stalks are used to symbolize them. The four operations complete the *Changes*—none do not proceed from this.

The *River Diagram*’s solid numbers total forty, omitting heaven’s five and two fives, yet using earth’s ten to derive fifty. Now, the four operations complete the *Changes*, and four times four stalks are counted. For each line, the stalks are counted three times, and the milfoil is combined with the left and right remainders—sometimes one and three make four, sometimes three and one make four, sometimes two and two make four. If the left remainder first reaches four, the right remainder must also subsequently reach four. Doubling the four pairs to make eight records the count, for odd numbers must have even counterparts. Odd numbers make four, even numbers make eight—this also shows how the count of forty increases by eight, for the *River Diagram*’s forty completes the Eight Trigrams.

Yet among the counted fours, five and nine never appear. Now, those who manipulate milfoil stalks insist that the first count must be either five or nine, originating from the *Yi Shu*, which states: the first change’s remainder must be either five or nine; the second and third counts’ remainders must be either four or eight. The error in the first count arises from including the "hanging one" stalk—still uncounted—within the total, thereby disrupting the four. For the counted remainders, adding one to four makes five, and adding one to eight makes nine—this is how it appears. Yet they fail to recognize that this added one, whether five or nine, fundamentally disrupts the counted four, causing nothing but confusion.

Moreover, "hanging one" is itself one of the four operations, occurring after the division symbolizing the Two and before the counting by fours—it has not yet been included in the counts. Were it not for the error of misplacing the "hanging one" within the counts, how could they claim that the second and third counts must be either four or eight? Each alternation of left and right counts of four constitutes one change. The *Commentary* states that eighteen changes complete a hexagram, so all counts in the changes must not differ—how can the first count in every three counts be either five or nine? If so, then among the eighteen changes, six would be distinct. If six changes alone differ, how can they still be called eighteen changes?

This error originated with Kong’s *Subcommentary*, and later scholars, failing to examine it closely, transmitted belief and doubt alike, growing ever more entangled, until none could correct the mistake—truly a lamentable oversight across a thousand years. If they claim that the "hanging one" is included in the odd numbers to serve as a count, then what of the "hanging one" performed after the operation? Tracing the source of the error, they clung to the derived number fifty, whose use is forty-nine, insisting that the "hanging one" is included within the forty-nine stalks used, unaware that the "hanging one" marks the use of forty-eight stalks in each change and calculates the total of eighteen changes—this is its true function. How could the one disrupt the many counts of forty-eight?

Thus, the yarrow stalks manipulated in each change number forty-eight, and the "hanging one" serves to record the eighteen changes—this is precisely how the forty-nine stalks are employed, combining with the one unused at the inception of the Great Ultimate to form the fifty of the *Dayan*. The reason fifty is called such lies in the virtue of the yarrow, which is round and spirit-like: its roundness is expressed in sevens, and seven sevens make forty-nine. The virtue of the hexagrams is square and knowing: their squareness is expressed in eights, and eight eights make sixty-four. Thus, the union of seven and eight—fifteen—is already manifest in the numerical interplay of yarrow and hexagrams.

The meaning of the six lines, which alternate to offer tribute, disperses and appears separately in the *Xian* hexagram’s "nine in use" and the *Kun* hexagram’s "six in use," where the sum of nine and six—fifteen—is employed, while the numbers five and below, along with seven, eight, nine, and six, remain unused. Therefore, multiplying ten by five yields the *Dayan*’s fifty. In this way, from heaven and earth, from one to ten, the number fifty-five reveals its true manifestation, and the *Dayan*’s fifty, along with its use of forty-nine, are likewise thoroughly examined in their essence.

Here, the ceaseless generation of the *Yi*, the formation of images in *Qian*, the emulation of *Kun*, the divination that exhausts numbers to foresee the future, and the affairs of universal transformation—all become perfectly clear. As for the unfathomable interplay of yin and yang, called the spirit-like, "only the spiritually enlightened can preserve its clarity"—this depends on the individual.

The *Shuo Gua* states: "In ancient times, the sages created the *Yi*, subtly aiding the spirit-like to generate the yarrow, measuring by three heavens and two earths to establish numbers, observing changes in yin and yang to erect hexagrams, and unfolding through hardness and softness to produce lines." If so, how could the yarrow arise idly? How could numbers be established in vain? How could hexagrams be erected casually? And how could lines be formed without purpose? Through lines, hexagrams are drawn; through hexagrams, numbers are divined; through numbers, yarrow is employed—to exhaust the traces of the world and to stimulate the world’s movements, this is their sequence.

The *Great Commentary* says: "The virtue of the yarrow is round and spirit-like; the virtue of the hexagrams is square and knowing; the meaning of the six lines is to alternate and offer tribute." This is how the *Dayan*’s numbers are manifested in the yarrow. The *Dayan*’s number reaches fifty stalks, yet only forty-nine are used—this is because one is revered as unused, embodying the complete form of the Great Ultimate, which is what is meant by "the *Yi* possesses the Great Ultimate."

Then, the forty-nine stalks are divided, arranged left and right into two to symbolize the Two Modes—this is "the Great Ultimate generates the Two Modes." The Two Modes are yin and yang; when yin and yang mutually model each other with elder and younger, the Two Modes already contain the Four Images. Next, one stalk is taken from the left and "hung" to symbolize the Three—the trigrams are formed by three strokes, embodying the Dao of the Three Powers. Adding the unused one from the original fifty, combined with the two from the divided pair, completes this Three. Thus, in dividing the two, one is set aside and "hung" between them, symbolizing the establishment of the human pole between the Two Modes.

Here, "measuring by three heavens and two earths" is subtly embedded: the unused one symbolizes the two, and the "hanging one" makes three—this is "measuring by three heavens." Dividing to symbolize the two is indeed "measuring by two earths." From this, changes in yin and yang are observed to erect hexagrams. The unused one of the Great Ultimate, though not employed, marks the inception of *Qian*’s yang with the first one, so its use ultimately arises from this.

Therefore, *Qian*’s one is divided to form *Kun*’s two—this is "symbolizing the Two to become the Two Modes." With the Two Modes, one yin and one yang, elder and younger occupy their positions, so the Two Modes already contain the Four Images. Following this, the "hanging one" symbolizes the Three, dividing yin and yang, alternating softness and hardness in use, and drawing with the Three—thus the Four Images generate the eight trigrams, and the eight trigrams are fully arrayed. Each of the eight trigrams has three positions, and with eight trigrams, a minor completion is achieved—the Dao of the Three Extremes is thereby revealed.

Taken together, this is: "The *Yi* possesses the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the eight trigrams"—this is manifest in use and complete in form. However, the application of the *Dayan*’s numbers, though briefly seen in the initial division of two and "hanging one," is not yet fully realized.

Moreover, the unused one of the Great Ultimate, the two symbolizing the Two Modes, and the three of the "hanging one," though arrayed in three positions, in actual use, only the unused one and the "hanging one" are employed—thus, the true count is merely two. Since fifty stalks begin with the use of two, the unused stalks remain forty-eight, corresponding to the *Hetu*’s number forty, which operates the eight trigrams. Each of the eight trigrams has six positions; with eight trigrams, each having six positions, is this not forty-eight? Though the eight trigrams multiply to sixty-four, the sixteen "wandering" and "returning" hexagrams are not listed among the six positions of the eight primary trigrams, so their number is limited to forty-eight.

From forty-eight, the sixteen hexagrams are abstracted above as four sets of four for the purpose of manipulation, thereby completing the sixty-four. Thus, observing changes in yin and yang to erect hexagrams, one then unfolds through hardness and softness to generate lines. Lines are what imitate the world’s movements. The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of earth as softness and hardness; the Dao of humanity as benevolence and righteousness. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, the *Yi* forms hexagrams with six lines.

Previously, the unused one, the two of images, and the three of "hanging one" were each multiplied by three, and from three to four, thus first dividing the left stalks. These were counted by fours to symbolize the four seasons, for just as the four seasons yield the eight solar terms, so too do the four images generate the eight trigrams. Therefore, by proceeding from four to eight, one sufficiently perceives the four-by-four of the sixteen hexagrams and the eight-by-eight of the sixty-four hexagrams in their imperial use. The odd numbers of the four-by-four serve to lodge the odd numbers of Qian’s eight-by-eight, while the odd numbers of Kun’s eight-by-eight, though termed even, are also odd. The four are harmonized in their pairing, hence they are collectively called "returning odd." The odd numbers from the counting may be one or two, three or four, and their return is thus termed "returning odd to achievement" to symbolize intercalary months. Intercalary months are where surplus numbers return, hence the odd symbolizes the odd as surplus. Then, dividing the right stalks, counting by fours, the odd numbers from this counting may be four or eight. If one is obtained, the prior odd from the left must be combined with three to make four; if three is obtained, the prior odd from the left must be combined with one to make four. If two is obtained, the prior odd from the left must likewise be combined with two to make four; if four is obtained, the prior odd from the left must be combined alone with four to make eight. For whether the left is first one and the right three, or the left first three and the right one, they invariably combine to make four as odd. Yet when the left is first two and the right two, though they also combine to make four, in principle this doubles four to form the even eight. If the left odd is already four and the right odd is also four, their combination makes eight as even. Though termed eight, this even is formed by the distribution of odd fours. Just as Kun’s one is derived from Qian’s one, they are collectively termed odd. Then, after combining the odd from the right and the odd stalks, they are again applied to the left, and the odd from both left and right are "hung" to await the second and third changes—this is called "repeated manipulation before hanging." However, the initial "hanging one" refers to taking one stalk from the forty-nine to hang separately during this manipulation, whereas the later "hanging" specifically means hanging the odd stalks. Then, summing the previously divided two, the already "hung" one, and the stalks already counted, all are recombined to return to the initial *dayan* number—this is called "four operations to complete the *Yi*," thereby forming the first line. The so-called four operations are: dividing into two, the first; hanging one, the second; counting by fours, the third; and concluding the return of the odd, the fourth. Once these operations are complete and the odd stalks are hung, the first change is concluded. After one change, excluding the previously odd stalks, the stalks combined from the prior *dayan* counting are again subjected to the operations of dividing into two, hanging one, counting by fours, and returning the odd. Then the odd stalks are hung to combine with the odd from the prior change, awaiting the third change. The third change follows the same operations of dividing into two, hanging one, counting by fours, and returning the odd as the first and second changes. Combining the odd stalks from these three changes and counting them, four is considered few and eight many. If all three changes yield few, the odd stalks total twelve, leaving thirty-six from the counted stalks, which is Qian’s number. If all three changes yield many, the odd stalks total twenty-four, leaving twenty-four from the counted stalks, which is Kun’s number. If two are many and one few, the odd stalks total twenty, leaving twenty-eight from the counted stalks, which are the numbers of Zhen, Kan, and Gen. If two are few and one many, the odd stalks total sixteen, leaving thirty-two from the counted stalks, which are the numbers of Xun, Li, and Dui. Only after three changes are thus completed is one line formed. The odd numbers must be recorded from beginning to end, from bottom to top, layer by layer, like the three lines of a trigram. Here, four is yang and eight is yin, modeled after the eight trigrams. For those with two many and one few: if the sequence is first four, middle eight, last eight, the initial yang is obtained, symbolizing the lesser yang seven of Zhen; if first eight, middle four, last eight, the middle yang is obtained, symbolizing the lesser yang seven of Kan; if first eight, middle eight, last four, the upper yang is obtained, symbolizing the lesser yang seven of Gen. For those with two few and one many: if the sequence is first eight, middle four, last four, the initial yin is obtained, symbolizing the lesser yin eight of Xun; if first four, middle eight, last four, the middle yin is obtained, symbolizing the lesser yin eight of Li; if first four, middle four, last eight, the upper yin is obtained, symbolizing the lesser yin eight of Dui. Whenever Zhen, Kan, or Gen are encountered, a yang line is drawn; whenever Xun, Li, or Dui are encountered, a yin line is drawn. These are all termed "lesser" because the lesser has not yet transformed. Only when the three changes collectively yield four, and four-by-four, is this specifically termed the pure yang, symbolizing the old yang nine of Qian, and drawn as a solid line—commonly called "double," representing the old yang nine. When the three changes collectively yield eight, and eight-by-eight, this is specifically termed the pure yin, symbolizing the old yin six of Kun, and drawn as a broken line—commonly called "intersecting," representing the old yin six. Qian as old yang originally possesses nine odd numbers yet transforms to contain the even six of yin. Kun as old yin originally possesses six even numbers yet transforms to contain the odd nine of yang.

The drawings of Qian and Kun are collectively termed "old" because it is by virtue of their age that they transform. That three changes must occur to complete a single line embodies the deliberation of yin-yang transformation to determine it. Among the counting rods left after three changes, the interplay of four and eight embodies the intent of Qian and Kun mutually seeking to generate the six children. Thus, through division, suspension, and manipulation—first accumulating the odd counts and then combining the surplus from repeated manipulations—three such operations are called "three changes," which complete one line. Another three changes complete a second line, and yet another three changes complete three lines—this is called "nine changes." When nine changes are complete and three lines are fully formed, these may correspond to the eight trigrams, which consist of only three lines. Tripling these three lines yields the eight trigrams in array. This is called the inner trigram, the lower trigram, the three subtle signs, or the inner constancy—here, the eight trigrams are said to be "minor completion," as the three *Yi* texts all refer to the eight primary trigrams.

Then, again through division, suspension, and manipulation—first accumulating the odd counts—three times three operations make nine changes, completing another three lines to form the outer trigram, the upper trigram, the three milfoil stalks, or the outer regret. Combined with the previous three lines from nine changes, this yields six lines to form a hexagram, which the three *Yi* texts refer to as the sixty-four distinct hexagrams. Only when all eighteen changes are complete is the hexagram fully formed, with its six positions fully expressed. The reason there must be eighteen changes is that Zhen, Kan, and Gen each require five lines, totaling fifteen, plus three from Qian, making eighteen. Alternatively, the first, third, and fifth lines of the two Qian hexagrams also total eighteen. Xun, Li, and Dui each require four lines, totaling twelve, plus six from Kun, making eighteen. Alternatively, the first, second, and fourth lines of the three Kun hexagrams also total eighteen. Combining these two eighteens yields Qian’s count of four nines—thirty-six. In the first nine changes, each line involves four manipulations, so nine changes accumulate thirty-six manipulations. Doubling this gives seventy-two, the count of tortoise-shell divination. The earth phase of the Five Agents governs the four seasons, each with eighteen days; four times eighteen also makes seventy-two days. Dividing each ninety-day season to include the earth’s eighteen-day reign also yields seventy-two. Thus, eighteen changes, with four manipulations per change, total seventy-two manipulations. Five times seventy-two makes three hundred sixty, corresponding to a full year’s days. Hence, the significance of eighteen changes and seventy-two manipulations in using the forty-nine milfoil stalks.

The first nine changes divide the three lines into yin and yang, merely arranging the eight trigrams in order with their images at the center. The latter nine changes interweave the three lines with softness and hardness, thereby doubling them to place the lines at the center. Through these eighteen changes, the lines alternate between softness and hardness. Using this interplay of soft and hard to mutually grind, agitate, push, and transform, their changes are made manifest. Extending this to the sixty-four hexagrams, wherever change leads, it is said that "change resides within." From the sixty-four hexagrams, extending by analogy to the three hundred eighty-four lines beyond, the capabilities of the world may truly be exhausted. Can the virtue of the milfoil stalks not be called round and spirit-like in their constant use? Can the virtue of the hexagrams not be called square and knowing in their constant form? Can the meaning of the six lines not be called responsive in offering their mandate, like an echo’s transformations? Can they not be said to be quiescent yet unmovable, yet when stimulated, thoroughly penetrate all under heaven’s patterns?

Thus, they are used to penetrate the world’s aspirations, accomplish its tasks, establish its enterprises, and resolve its doubts. In their subtle assistance to the divine luminosity to generate the milfoil stalks, they participate in heaven and pair with earth to rely on numbers; they observe changes in yin and yang to establish hexagrams, and unfold through hardness and softness to generate lines—how could these be idly produced? How could numbers be vainly relied upon? How could hexagrams be carelessly established? How could lines be casually formed? Truly, by mastering this Dao to spiritually illuminate one’s virtue, one can manifest the Dao, spiritually empower conduct, and repay the divine with offerings. The Great Expansion’s number is fifty, of which forty-nine are used. Such is the reason. *Yi Divination and the Permeation of Change*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.
