**The Scripture of the Nine Perfected on the Fivefold Return and Thrice Reversion in the Practice of the Daoist Observances**

**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Nine Perfected on the Fivefold Return and Thrice Reversion in the Practice of the Daoist Observances*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Sui-Tang period.

The *Scripture of the Nine Perfected on the Fivefold Return and Thrice Reversion in the Practice of the Daoist Observances* expounds the method of cultivating the five gates of observation. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Tai Xuan Section.

The Dao speaks: Good men and women who cultivate the true Way must observe without desire, subtly perceiving the true mind, penetratingly and luminously illumined. Thoughts of conditioned action arise in the present mind, yet they do not originate from the illuminating mind; one knows and grasps the dharmas of the mind. Simply understand the mind and the dharmas of the mind; do not generate the understanding of the mind and the dharmas of the mind. Let the mind be quiescent; do not generate the quiescence of the quiescent mind. Let quiescence be non-quiescence; do not make non-quiescence non-quiescent.

It further states: Wood without fire and earth without fire—these two are alike in their absence. Wood without fire and wood without man—these two are alike in their absence. The mind without knowing and wood without knowing—these two are alike in their absence. The mind without knowing and the mind without wood—these two are alike in their absence. Within sameness, confusion arises, thus grasping the true leads to error. Beyond sameness, severance occurs, thus grasping the true leads to nothingness. Therefore, within the great chaos, there are immeasurable natures; the immeasurable natures all depend on the true nature. Through karmic resonance, forms are generated—like fire arising from wood, like knowing arising from the mind. They manifest and transform in the world, impermanent and subject to arising and ceasing. The true nature of the Dao is fundamentally without arising or ceasing. Those who purify their minds and unite with the Dao thereby return to the root and recover the true constancy of life.

At that time, a verse was intoned within the Mystery:

Knowing arises from conditions,
Fire is born from causes.
Each is a true seed-nature,
Yet riding the current, the source of the Dao is lost.
To still knowing by arousing the mind,
The mind arises, and knowing becomes more vexed.
Understanding that the nature is fundamentally empty,
Knowing is the gate of all wonders.

The Dao speaks: When uncarved wood is fashioned into vessels, one rides the current of discriminating consciousness and perceives objects. Within the dharmas of perceiving objects, there are four deluded knowings: first, the knowing of the inner mind; second, the knowing of external objects; third, the shared knowing of both; fourth, the abandonment of knowing. Yet these deluded knowings are merely names; apart from these four delusions, there is no separate truth. Why is this so? Knowing is not two, hence the delusion of inner and outer. Knowing is not one, hence the delusion of the middle. Knowing is not nonexistent, hence the delusion of severance. Knowing is not existent, hence the delusion of constancy. Therefore, the perception of objects is like dew, like bubbles.

It is also said: Ordinary beings create marvels as illusions; sages manifest transformations through spiritual powers. Echoes, reflections, dreams, and imaginings are all empty; grasping sameness as truth is erroneous. Only with the power of wisdom can one luminously illumine the true. Understanding the mind is the Dao; the true and the deluded are not two. Without abandoning inner and outer, the true and the deluded are not one. As objects appear, consciousness arises; as consciousness arises, objects are seen. Consciousness and objects have no fixed existence or nonexistence. Without before or after, neither constant nor severed, ultimately pure and quiescent, perfectly tranquil and unconditioned, naturally and spontaneously, one ascends to the fruit of the Great Unity. This is the returning to the Dao, reverting to the root and the true constancy.

At that time, a verse was intoned in the void:

Uncarved wood fashioned into vessels,
Images of wheels emerge from the formless.
Holding the center without faltering in faith,
One rides the current, revolving through life and death.
Consciousness and objects arise interdependently,
Inner and outer deluded knowings are formed.
Understanding that the true and the deluded are one,
The mind returns and merges with the Dao.

The Dao speaks: From green to yellow is the wave; abandoning green and other colors to enter the eye is the return to the body. From the eye to the ear is the wheel of consciousness; abandoning the eye and other sense organs to return to the mind is the return to spirit. From thought to thought is arising and ceasing; abandoning thoughts and other numerical states to revert to quiescence is the return to life. Returning to life and uniting with the Dao, the Dao also unites with it. Inner and outer are equally true, free and unimpeded. The nature of unimpededness pervades the dharma-realm, universally penetrating the Dao-eye. It illumines all forms and characteristics; green and other characteristics appear within the Dao-eye. The eye and the characteristics are neither identical nor separate. They equally abide in the true essence, neither severed nor constant.

Within this dharma, a verse was intoned:

When the mind is pure, the true root appears,
When the root is pure, the wondrous object is revealed.
The wondrous object now communicates with the mind,
The mind is clear, and life is constantly returned.
The Dao-mind is fundamentally not two,
Yet it flows together in the five destinies.
Detached from things, detached from life and death,
Neither human nor Daoist realm.

The Dao speaks: From Yi to Qin is transmigration; from human to ghost is hastening through the realms. From the mundane to the immortal is escaping death; from the ordinary to the sage is returning to constancy. Returning to constancy and recovering life, recovering life and realizing the Dao, the nature of the Dao is limpid and pure, universally and perfectly luminous. Thus, it can uphold and illumine all characteristics such as Yi. Characteristics and nature are interdependent; dependent, thoughts arise. Thoughts do not abide; they arise and cease together. This arising and ceasing nature neither arises nor ceases, neither arises nor ceases, hence it is neither provisional nor real. Therefore, all Daoist realms enter into the great nature of the Dao, transcending conditioned existence and departing from all karmic characteristics.

At that time, within this nature, a verse was intoned:

The realms of Yi, Qin, and others,
Through karmic resonance, share the same abode.
The paths of humans and ghosts differ,
Yet existence and nonexistence do not obstruct each other.
Escaping death, one practices the return to the Dao,
Recovering life, one reverts to true constancy.
With a limpid mind and a pure Dao-eye,
All wonders appear in their directions.

The Dao speaks: The four dharma-gates practiced by the Perfected—if heavenly beings, humans, men, and women cultivate them without laxity, they will ascend to the unconditioned and unite with the Dao in truth.

The Dao speaks: The true wonder of virtue and the Dao embodies the primordial and boundless. It pervades yin and yang, congeals the numinous in heaven and earth, scatters essence and disperses simplicity, shaping and forming all things. The resonance of forms and categories is not subject to karmic conditions; the responses of karmic nature unfold in myriad ways. The dark and mysterious origin of the karmic realm neither increases nor decreases. Only life and death, through defilement, become causes. The Nine Hells and the Five Perfected, riding the currents of action, receive their retribution.

What are the Nine Hells?
1. The first is the Hell of Violating the Great Dao: contracting the profound darkness, naturally receding, the true constancy is concealed. The measuring ghosts afflict the dharma-body, and one receives the hidden retribution of the Pure and True Hell. The Jade Emperor presides over it, maintaining equanimity while bearing the transgression.

Second is the Hell of Violating the Dark Virtue: losing the origin of transformation, purity receives turbidity, and the utmost nature surges. The deluded ghosts afflict the seed-consciousness, and one receives the karmic retribution of the Three Bonds Hell. The Heavenly Sovereign presides over it, maintaining restlessness while bearing the transgression.

Third is the Hell of Violating the Nature’s Origin: arising defiled emotions, the mysterious essence is lost, and true wisdom is submerged. The grotesque ghosts afflict the conditional body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Final Beginning Hell. The Earthly Sovereign presides over it, maintaining delusion while bearing the transgression.

Fourth is the Hell of Violating Rational Nature: pursuing chaos and vexation, the nature of intent is deluded, and the origin of consciousness is impaired. The deceitful ghosts afflict the square body, and one receives the destructive retribution of the Five Relations Hell. The Human Sovereign presides over it, maintaining suffering while bearing the transgression.

Fifth is the Hell of Violating Trust and Practicing Deceit: the mouth is obstructed and the spleen labored. The Azure Heaven ghosts afflict the abandoned will and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Universal Plunder Hell. The Yellow Emperor presides over it, maintaining flogging while bearing the transgression.

Sixth is the Hell of Violating Benevolence and Practicing Killing: the eyes darken and the liver decays. The White Heaven ghosts afflict the scattered soul and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Wind and Thunder Hell. The Green Emperor presides over it, maintaining blades while bearing the transgression.

Seventh is the Hell of Violating Righteousness and Practicing Robbery: the nose is blocked and the lungs wither. The Vermilion Heaven ghosts afflict the departed spirit and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Vajra Hell. The White Emperor presides over it, maintaining burning while bearing the transgression.

Eighth is the Hell of Violating Propriety and Practicing Licentiousness: the tongue is numbed and the heart startled. The Dark Heaven ghosts afflict the departed spirit and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Fire Veil Hell. The Red Emperor presides over it, maintaining freezing while bearing the transgression.

Ninth is the Hell of Violating Wisdom and Practicing Folly: the ears deafen and the kidneys exhaust. The Black Heaven ghosts afflict the withered essence and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Profound Cold Hell. The Black Emperor presides over it, maintaining crushing while bearing the transgression.

The punishments received in these hells are measured in kalpas for the grave and in years for the light, cycling through their karmic power until the full count is reached. To depart from them, one must cultivate the Five Victories. What are the Five Victories?

First is the initial examination of the Five Knowings, illuminating the Ten Practices, entering the Gate of Non-Delusion.
Second is the subsequent observation of the mind’s wisdom, understanding impermanence, entering the Gate of Arising and Ceasing.
Third is the advanced cultivation of faith and wisdom, purifying the karmic field, entering the Gate of Returning to Stillness.
Fourth is the wondrous attainment of the seed of mystery, merging with the dark root, entering the Gate of Penetrating True Clarity.
Fifth is the defiled union with the illuminating Dao, ascending to universal brightness, entering the Gate of True Penetration and Realization.

These Five Perfected practices, when cultivated, render body and mind wondrously penetrating, fully and perfectly accomplished. One departs from impermanence and attains the True Constant Dao. The True Constant Dao pervades without limit, neither existent nor non-existent, neither constant nor discontinuous—this is the true nature of the Dao, naturally so.

Within this dharma, a verse is composed:

The True Constant sustains the Six Paths,
Traversing realms to arise from violated ethics.
Luminous, it abides in the wilds of stillness;
Obscure, the ten thousand images divide.
Karmic impressions receive form and transformation;
Forms, in turn, stir mind and spirit.
Spirit and form mutually depend,
Movement becomes the cause of karmic return.
Nine transgressions lead to their hells;
Five Victories ascend to their perfection.
The Dao’s mystery penetrates the sea of mind;
The mind’s mystery is the Dao’s nature.
As non-being, it is not the extinction of nature;
As being, it is not duality.
In things, it is neither life nor death;
Apart from things, it is not constant nor existent.

The Dao speaks: Good men and women, if you can cultivate the Five Victories and ascend into the True Gate, you will depart from the Nine Hells, attain the supreme position, fully realize the dharma-realm, and verify the True Constant Dao.

At that time, the assembly of immortals, hearing this teaching, rejoiced in their hearts and praised in verse:

The ten directions’ boundless realms,
One Dao, one sentient being.
Six destinies linked like a sinking sea,
One constant, one failure to succeed.
Truth and delusion are not two realities;
Sin and merit are not empty names.
Only by verifying the Dao’s essence
Do the Three Realms become the Three Purities.

The Perfected One practices the Dao and offers this verse of verification.

The Dao speaks: Good men and women, if you wish to depart from all suffering and ascend into non-action, you must cultivate the Nine Perfected practices of advancing the Dao.

The practitioner of the Dao upholds precepts, ceases thoughts, purifies the mind, and guards the One. Externally, they sever all views; internally, they remove all defilements. Departing from the Three Existences, they verify that non-action, naturally and spontaneously attaining the supreme position.

At that time, the Perfected One, hearing this teaching, attained liberation of mind. Proceeding to the Dao-ground, they received benefit according to their depth or shallowness, each praising their capacity in verse:

The first Perfected One’s verse:
Having understood and departed from all views,
The mind is still, external defilements removed.
The six evils and delusions are exhausted;
The Correct One naturally abides.
Attaining verification of no-self,
Utterly alone yet not solitary,
Ascending through the gates of myriad wonders,
Forever penetrating emptiness and non-being.

The second Perfected One’s verse:
The utmost person verifies the emptiness of dharmas,
Nature pure, internally without defilement.
Desires and cravings already extinguished,
Without defilement, without anything.
Thus attaining liberation,
Unbound by any experience,
Arriving at the ground of non-action,
Ever noble, feeding on the Mother.

The third Perfected One’s verse:
Without place, without end or beginning,
Neither perishing nor abiding.
Without thought, without love of form,
Mysteriously uniting with the subtle and imperceptible.
Attaining equality with the True One’s wanderings,
Transformations beyond reckoning.
Penetratingly vast, without form,
Ascending the mysterious, returning or not returning.

The fourth Perfected One’s verse:
Without emptiness, without formless,
Without consciousness, without habitual seeing.
Without mind, without non-thought,
Without nature, without conditioned arising.
Spirit and form do not follow one another,
Mutually dependent yet not interpenetrating.
Forever severing the flow of life and death,
No suffering can reach them.

The fifth Perfected One’s verse:
The mind’s essence has no location,
True nature abides in emptiness.
Desires and habits already extinguished,
Spirit penetrates into the unobstructed.
Not abiding in any existence or emptiness,
Not forsaking the Great Clarity’s gate.
Naturally penetrating the wondrous seed,
Wandering and dwelling in the True Pure Heaven.

The sixth Perfected One’s verse:
True nature admits no grasping or rejecting,
The habits of form naturally perish.
Not exhausting conditioned action,
Not dwelling in the Dao-ground.
Ever in the boundless realm,
Accordant with things yet not illuminating.
Unobstructed, without division,
Mysteriously one with the Dao’s guiding principle.

The seventh Perfected One’s verse:
Illuminating wisdom enters dependent arising,
Spirit radiant, surging through the Great Void.
The habits of form already extinguished,
Past knots completely dissolved in emptiness.
Thus in the sea of life and death,
At ease in the palace of liberation.

Without arising from the Great Samādhi,
Wisdom operates boundlessly.

The eighth Perfected One’s verse:
Heart and Dao are not two principles,
Without bounds, without location.
In function yet ever quiescent,
Without birth, without any master.
Truth and delusion share the same source,
Responding to change without fixed abode.
The hundred dharmas naturally unfold in clarity,
The three mysteries luminously manifest.

The ninth Perfected One’s verse:
The power of empty wisdom is self-so,
Through responsive realization the Dharma-body is attained.
The two truths are ever quiescent,
The three ages illumine the precious round.
Past and present know no before or after,
The one who masters is no-self.
Seven transformations have no fixed form,
The six penetrations are not other than spirit.

At this time, each Perfected One having recited their verses, all paid reverent respect, remained in their stations, hearts filled with joy, and arrayed in full dignity. They turned toward the Dao Lord, offered salutations, and departed.
