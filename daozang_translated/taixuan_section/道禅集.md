**The Dao-Chan Collection**
*By Master Wang Zhenren of Jinpo*

On occasion, companions repeatedly inquired about Chan practice, and their earnest, unyielding pursuit filled me with delight. Yet, reflecting on my own limited talent and dull wit, my feeble words and shallow expressions brought shame upon the monastic assembly. Unworthy of such virtue and discipline, I found myself lost in dreams within dreams—stacking heads upon heads.

Within the plum-bamboo grove, thorny flowers bloom;
Amidst the lion’s den, foxes howl in defiance.
Yet without sudden awakening, this remains but a fleeting thought—
No turning of the body to grasp even half the truth.

If one does not pluck some tendrils of the vine,
The lock’s key will never turn.
First, rely on **one essence**—
Its clarity breaks through all bonds.
Next, acknowledge **the four inversions**—
Employ them to perfect the whole.

Forgotten name, abandoned form—
Extinguish the false, reveal the true.
Avoid the paths of the Three Vehicles,
Shatter the gates of all marvels.
Within speech, the echo responds;
Within phrases, the mechanism unfolds.

A formless wisdom-sword—
Wielded at will, it cuts through all appearances.
A pearl beyond form—
Given freely to all who seek.

Phrases like autumn moon sifting jade,
Words like spring flowers weaving silk.
Ultimately, pointing to the moon—
Once the moon is seen, the finger has no use.
Seeking fish requires a net—
Once the fish is caught, what need remains for the net?

Thus, when the painted screen is shattered,
The worldly household’s wind is known.
When the barrel’s bottom is shed,
No trace of life’s calculations remains.

Add a hair’s breadth—
Like a thorn in the eye.
Subtract a hair’s breadth—
Like a wound carved into flesh.

Without one of keen insight,
This truth remains unshared.

Now, failing to recognize one’s own eyebrows,
Yet tearing apart another’s face—
This teaches: seeing and hearing must be direct,
Lest one grope blindly through heaven and earth.

Those who penetrate it may set it aside;
Those of wisdom may adapt it freely.

Thus, it mends the chaos of **Hun Dun**—
Seven orifices harmonized in unity.
It strikes the void—
The six directions crumble to dust.

Though lacking in startling techniques,
It holds **qi-circulation** and **sharp wit**—
This understanding is like gazing at the sky through mist;
This fluidity is like seeing the sun through parted clouds.

Why traverse ten thousand rivers and mountains,
When the Ten Isles and Three Realms lie at hand?
Seek no virtuous cause beneath the straw sandals,
Nor question the heart’s essence upon the meditation cushion.

The eight characters before you—open them.
The two hands below—receive them.

Those with eyes must bear the burden;
Those without strength must exert it.

**Following is a verse for all to verify:**

*Preface to the Verse:*

The iron wealth and copper voice—
Qi and resolve unyielding,
Lip-swords and tongue-lances like spears.
Yet come near, and heads fall—
Heads not fallen still bear wounds.

Ask: who bears the wounds?
Who loses the head?
Headless, ears and eyes intact—
Wounded, blind and deaf as stone.

The void resounds with drumbeats—
Who is guest, who host?

**Seventy-fourth Verse:**
Naturally, guest and host suffer no loss,
Motion and stillness both forgotten—
The Dao’s true nature is still sickness;
How bear to speak of subtler mysteries?

When mysteries are shattered—how then?
Face-to-face, the truth is plain.

Pluck forth the white egret from the void—
No need to speak of surpassing New La.

Daily life’s plainness, naturally attained—
No law can be passed on.

No need for fists or idle faith;
Moonlight and wind say all of Zen.

Two hundred realms in the eye’s dust—
Mountains, rivers, earth—all gathered in a mote.

Seek not the Ten Directions, Three Realms—
All lies within the gilded staff’s tip.

Traverse the world yet the body stirs not—
Each thing shattered, roundly perfected.

Why speak of *Changchun*’s scene?
White daylight, clear wind, bright moon.

Awakened, the whole body is eyes;
Lost, sighted yet blind as night.

The world asks: how many bear the plank?
Do not doubt—daylight shines night and day.

Iron men bear the plank—soundless;
Stone maidens blow the *sheng*—lips unmoved.
Rotten wood laughs in winter’s thaw,
Cold cliffs bloom with strange spring.

Wide learning, much knowing—Zen unmet,
Foolish cats guard dens in vain.

Pitiful, wise men of past and present—
Eyed yet how fail to see the sky?

All bear the White Guan Yin—
Roundly responsive, seek not beyond.
Ears, eyes, tongue, voice all grasp the marvel—
Seeing, hearing, knowing—one mind.

Zen’s path has never been easy—
Clarity reveals the thorn’s true nature.

How bear the inner void’s true display?
Like clouds parted, the sun revealed.

Round perfection, light equal to emptiness—
Not a hair’s breadth wasted in an instant’s work.

If the crown’s true eye is complete,
The eight extremes merge as one.

The void as drum, I as mallet—
Strike clear: what doubt remains?

Turn aside the Dao’s idle pair—
Saint and commoner both unharmed.

One phrase strikes true—ancestral wind—
From first, water leaks not through.

Sometimes tiger roars, dragon sings—
Leaping from the spirit mountain’s sea.

Luminous, the body’s marvel—
Filling the void, never enough.

Ask: where lies its true core?
Green willows sway as ever.

Iron flute, no holes—wooden man blows,
One resonant note shakes the earth’s might.
Awakens the thousand-handed compassion—
Divine power reveals the full truth.

Everywhere, the void—one sky—
Why seek afar the profound?

Within the body, Buddhas and Immortals dwell—
Ten Directions revealed before the eyes.

Do not puzzle Zen’s truth as riddle—
Empty heart, transparent as the Thus-Come One.

Within, chew through the poem’s taste—
Grass, wood, mountains, rivers—eyes open wide.

From the beginning of the eon, unchanged—
Peach blossoms, last year’s red, this year’s glow.

Who knows the hundred grasses’ intent?
The original master lingers at the tips.

One spark of spirit mixes the Nine Heavens—
Encounter green, and Penglai’s eyes turn.

Before spring, willow fluff dances with wind,
After winter, plum blooms with snow.

Clapping hands, stroking beard—one laugh—
Awakened, all things accord with truth.

Heaven’s spring color knows no height—
Narrow earth’s branches, long or short.

Among wolves and tigers, stand firm—
Slaves and maids distinguish kin from stranger.

Every home may pierce the Chang’an road—
How few reach Chang’an’s gate.

The white ox dwells in white clouds,
Formless, striding the morning wind.

Leisurely till the elixir fields of sun and moon,
Nurturing the spirit’s seeds—no labor needed.

The Daoist walks unstained by dust,
Only fearing true awakening’s delay.

Ever chasing fragrant grass paths,
Unknowing of forsaking home’s spring.

A thought of nonbirth grasps true nature—
Bo’s vines entangle like calamity.

Sudden shatter of the mystic gate’s lock—
Moonlight and wind, the free.

One spark of spirit mixes the Great Void—
Paramount Zen wastes no effort.

Plain body, plain Dao—
Plain Dao, yet none.

Gazing at True Suchness—still deluded,
Seeing, hearing, knowing—fourfold error.

Recognizing the heart, bearing the original—
Still falls to the Dao’s second stage.

Seated, the Ten Directions are one home—
Cold cliffs, dead wood—new shoots sprout.

If one attains *Changchun*’s scene,
Iron trees bloom with clear flowers.

Midst June’s scorching heat—how endure?
Beneath rootless trees, frost clings to leaves.

One ember in the red furnace—cold snow—
Intent pure, taste ever long.

Sudden chill in the western wind—
Hedge’s golden chrysanthemums whisper scent.

Autumn’s light does not deceive the old—
Still, late-blooming yellow flowers perfume.

To grasp Zen, each phrase must pass—
South becomes north, east calls west.

Ancient cases all severed—
Piercing the Thus-Come One’s marvelous void.

Touching all, yet who reveals?
Dwelling, walking, sitting—tightly bound.

Round enlightenment, all possess—
Rotten bones like mountains, unaware.

Ask: has one seen the two mud oxen?
Fighting in the boundless ocean’s depths.
Nostrils sever the sky’s message—
One loss, no-form moon at autumn’s height.

Eye-disease chases fleeting flowers—
One moves, ten thousand waves follow.
Disease gone, flowers faded—Zen struggles free,
Moonlight and wind, unknowing.

Raw iron brought to the kitchen’s forge,
Cast as sour fillings and fine pastries.
If one chews through its taste,
They stumble into impermanence’s embrace.

Westward, ten thousand eight thousand leagues—
To sit still is to walk.

Poetry calls back the plank-bearer—
Open the rear’s eye, clear as day.

The Great Sage reveals: one word holds many meanings,
Who taught you to chant *Amituo*?

Entering the gate, three thousand blows are struck—
Swiftly ask the elder brother: does he feel the pain?

Let all entanglements rest, no need to probe,
Do not ask of the three before or three behind.

Only attain the purity of your native land’s breeze,
Far mountains still lock in misty peaks.

White oxen graze on dew-lit earth—hold them not,
Feast on hunger, drink on thirst, weary in spring and autumn.

The wooden man does not grasp the sealed tongue,
Speaking to green hills, which nod in silence.

Amidst the myriad forms, only one body stands revealed—
Now anger, now joy, now distant, now close.

How can you bear to hear, see, and know?
All are but kin within your own house.

To know the parents before they were born,
Only in the human form, not in the heavens.

A hundred clashing thoughts shatter the skull,
Would you dare neglect the Master’s Zen?

Frog’s cave in autumn frost, clam’s womb in gestation,
Pearls do not come from such depths.

Saints and mortals blend in the red dust,
A single golden lotus blooms in fire’s embrace.

How is this your family now?
Before your eyes, the sand of ignorance is cleared.

Still, men commend the green lotus,
Spring crows chirp, cursing fallen flowers.

Binding the West, South, North as Daoist talk,
Within the six directions lies but one hermitage.

From this point, no dwelling in the realm of mortals and saints,
Far mountains remain blue as the sky.

No excess, no deficiency—wondrously complete,
In taking and discarding, it is unbearable.

To carve out flesh-wounds still endures,
But piercing the eye’s blade is hard to taste.

Yesterday’s strike shattered the *Taixu* void,
Recognizing the ancient master from the start.

Yet you turn and gather the empty space,
Still leaving it lost in boundless obscurity.

Do not blame the wild and reckless for their lack,
They dare to split the nature of ignorance and mortals.

If you summon the nameless master,
Who dares to sever and trim the empty space?

The empty space is plucked with cause,
Seek the ancient master from before.

Now that you know the empty space,
You see the true form is whole and real.

Daoists meet—one moment of clarity,
Before your eyes, beneath your brows—what more to guess?

Men can savor the waters of the Western River,
Riding mud-dragons to emerge from the sea.

Understanding the pure and empty Zen,
When hungry, eat; when weary, sleep.

To know the true upward path,
Point to the high pine on the cloud’s edge.

Which school shares the Way with Daoists?
Its wonder lies in human transformation.

Autumn moon, spring flowers, winter snow and hail—
All are the master’s own.

Ask: do you not know the world’s path?
Ears perceive objects, eyes see as brows.

The spring in the kettle never changes,
Outside things hold their own winds and lights.

Ten thousand leagues of river and sky, one hue in autumn,
Three peaks, four seas—scenes pure and profound.

If you press down the divine dragon’s head,
It will not drift with waves and tides.

I reveal the rare mysteries of the void,
Yet you bind yourself, creating endless doubt.

When enlightenment dawns, the sun opens your eyes,
In confusion, wind ruffles the water’s brow.

A single spark of *lingqi* shines like the Emperor’s,
From ancient times, no saints could proclaim it.

Yet you teach the world beyond the forms,
Gushing streams and pine winds speak Zen.

Needle’s tip and sesame’s hole are not narrow,
Sea’s edge and heaven’s farthest are not wide.

Boundless clarity fills your formless eyes,
Brightly seen, no deceit from others.

Pity those who chase illusions in empty flowers,
Turning their backs on my gate to seek another’s.

They say there is no original matter,
Yet the *Miaoxuan* still seems like sand in the eye.

Before the hall, emerald bamboo rises smoke-free,
Outside the willow, oriole’s song slides like a string.

With eyes, Zen is still commended—
No need to speak of *Laopo Zen*.

Seeing colors, hearing sounds—true nature revealed,
Head by head, the Dharma King’s body shines.

Who recognizes the flowers in full bloom?
They are the sacred seeds that forget spring.

Boundless Zen-heart measures emptiness equally,
No need for words to exhaust all scriptures.

Within this, the ancient commendation stands,
Trustworthy on brow and in eye.

Seeing things and knowing the mind reveals the mind,
Knowing the mind turns the great earth to gold.

Within your body lies a bright pearl,
Do not seek it beneath the dragon’s jaw.

Sometimes you hold fast but let no wind pass,
Wasting the teacher’s efforts, misusing your practice.

Overthrow the golden-haired, aged one,
The hare teaches men to call the master.

Treading the world’s edge, your feet do not move,
Where feet do not move, the Dao’s subtleties are grasped.

Do you not hear the monkeys’ cries or sparrows’ chatter?
All speak of the upward path of the *zongcheng*.

Three bodies, four knowings—yet no head,
Eight solutions, six penetrations—wondrously complete.

Face and form were originally perfect,
No need for rouge—still elegant and free.

Asking of the Way, Zen—hard to behold,
Like waves rising on flat ground.

Confusion’s clouds scatter, revealing true emptiness,
Ten thousand leagues of river and sky—one chill hue.

Men come to ask of my ancestral Buddha’s school,
Pointing directly to the first peak of the sacred mountain.

With hands, it is hard to search,
Yet without the mind, the ancient face appears.

*Jaya* raises his fist as if to greet you,
*Ananda* folds his palms—what doubt remains?

Carved jade has no shadow, twin pine trees stand,
Flowers laugh, binding winds—the first branch.

I possess an elixir beyond the world,
No need to forge—simply take as is.

Unseal the musk of the mind,
Pierce the nose’s scent of Zen’s harmony.

Mind and realm both forgotten, ten thousand realms shine,
Bare roots beneath the tree—leaves frozen in stillness.

The wooden man is about to leave his boots behind,
The stone maiden invites conversation on brief and long.

Overturning the *Xuanxuan*, no true foundation stands,
Dao and Zen are seen through—dust in the eye.

Laughing rocks and withered trees,
A separate Penglai grotto blooms with spring.

Raise your fist—do you understand?
Bow your head, and terns fly past New罗.

Do not speak of my family’s wind to the confused,
Words unmatched—one sentence too many.

Original face equals emptiness—same in measure,
Yet hard to speak of—who is the one?

The round form needs no moon for comparison,
Wisdom’s light shines, leaving no lack.

What need for boasting after great enlightenment?
Dao and Zen are seen through—sand in the eye.

Piercingly bright, illuminating the true void,
Eight extremes observed—all as one.

Yet true emptiness is not in words,
My clumsy verses express its spirit.

The Great Void though without form,
Each pinch reveals its freshness anew—
Dao and Zen, both exhausted in unity.
