#### **Fasting and Abstinence**
To enter stillness and cultivate the Perfected, one must rely on fasting and abstinence. By guarding the mouth and cautioning against transgressions, the Dao is gradually ascended.

The *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* states:
Yan Hui asked, “May I inquire into the method?”
Confucius replied, “Fast!”
“I shall tell you.”
Yan Hui said, “My family is poor. For months, I have not drunk wine nor eaten meat. May this be considered fasting?”
Confucius said, “This is the fasting of sacrificial offerings, not the fasting of the mind.”
Yan Hui asked, “May I inquire into the fasting of the mind?”
Confucius replied, “Unity! The Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.”

Again, when Confucius asked about the Supreme Dao, Laozi said:
“Purify and fast, dredge and empty the heart, cleanse and refine the spirit, strike and shatter wisdom. The office of the Dao is thus—how difficult to speak of! I shall tell you its outline.”

The *Sacred Records of the Supreme Thearch of Mysterious Origin* states:
According to the fasting methods in the scriptures, there are roughly three kinds:
1. **Establishing Fasts** to refine virtue and dissolve transgressions.
2. **Fasting by Moderating Diet**, which harmonizes the spirit and preserves longevity. This is the fasting of sacrifices, practiced by middling adepts.
3. **Fasting of the Mind**, which dredges and empties the heart to remove cravings; cleanses and refines the spirit to eliminate defilements; strikes and shatters wisdom to sever thoughts. Without thought or worry, one concentrates on the Dao; without cravings or desires, one delights in the Dao; without encumbrances, one unites with the Dao. Since the mind harbors no dualistic intentions, it is called “single-minded.” This is practiced by superior adepts.

Fasting means alignment. Only by ordering the Three Karmas does one achieve alignment. If one merely observes dietary restrictions without deep understanding, or if one merely maintains single-mindedness while the mouth still craves flavors, these two methods must complement each other internally and externally.

The *Scripture of Great Sincerity* states:
“Pacify the heart in stillness, focus the thoughts without duality, refrain from eating past noon, and maintain inner and outer purity.”

Though Confucius belittled mere dietary restraint, he did not know how to regulate the mind. Thus, he taught fasting methods to enable reception of the Dao. Yet how many among later learners can truly empty the heart and unify the will?

Those who vulgarize the teachings of sacrifice, claiming to grasp the principle of the fasting of the mind, are but indolent and negligent fools. Though they speak of emptiness and quiescence, they do not understand their own delusions—this is self-deception.

#### **The Six Forms**
1. **Upper Clarity Fast**

There are two methods: first, to seclude oneself from the crowd and feast in solitude, stilling the qi and transcending the form; second, to perform the *Heart Fast*, purifying the mind and cleansing the spirit. Second, the *Lingbao Fast*. It comprises six methods: first, the *Golden Register Fast*, for instructing and delivering the king; second, the *Yellow Register Fast*, for rescuing and uplifting the ancestors of the world; third, the *Illuminating Perfection Fast*, for repenting sins in the Nine Dark Realms; fourth, the *Three Primes Fast*, primarily for confessing violations of precepts and commandments; fifth, the *Eight Festivals Fast*, for repenting and washing away past and present transgressions; sixth, the *Natural Fast*, for praying blessings upon the common people. Third, the *Dongshen Fast*, where refinement and simplicity are paramount, cutting off worldly dust to await the numinous. Fourth, the *Great One Fast*, where reverence and solemnity take precedence. Fifth, the *Purposeful Teaching Fast*, where purity and simplicity are esteemed. Sixth, the *Charcoal and Ashes Fast*, where diligence and austerity are the measure of merit.

These fasts, from ancient times to the present, involve ascending the altar to make vows, invoking the oaths of the mysterious sages. They may last three, seven, nine, or fifteen days, during which the Dao is practiced through the six periods of day and night, scriptures are recited, and repentance is offered. The rituals are exceedingly solemn, with protocols meticulously arranged in the *Shangqing* tradition—secluding oneself from the crowd, feasting in solitude, stilling the qi, and transcending the form. Apart from the *Heart Fast*, all others are fasts for kings, common people, and Daoist practitioners to deliver their ancestors, confess personal transgressions, avert calamities, and invoke blessings.

Over time, with changing eras, these practices have varied in detail. Among the *Lingbao Fasts*, some are observed for half a day. Without prior invitation or recorded merits, repentance may last only one or two periods, omitting the threefold incense offerings, the pacing of the void, and the recitation of scriptures. In minor fasts, one may perform the Three Bows and offer vows, adapting to circumstances as needed. Since these are not grand assemblies, sincerity suffices.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes and Precepts* states: In the first, seventh, and tenth months, on the days when the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water review and record deeds, one may observe a fast. The *Sacred Records* say: The seventh day of the first month is called the *Ascending Reward Upper Assembly Fast*; the seventh day of the seventh month is called the *Celebrating Life Middle Assembly Fast*; the fifth day of the tenth month is called the *Establishing Life Lower Assembly Fast*. On these three assembly fasts, the Three Officials assess merits and transgressions. By fasting and presenting petitions on these days, one may pray for blessings.

The *Illuminating Perfection Regulations* state: The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months are the six fasting months of the year. By observing fasts during these months, one may ascend to the Three Heavenly Emperors, and the envoys of the Great One will relieve people of ten sufferings. The *Secret Words of the Eight Dao* say: The first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh months are the nine fasting months of the Perfected. The first, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth days of each month are the three fasting days within the month.

The first day of the first month is called *Heavenly La*, the fifth day of the fifth month *Earthly La*, the seventh day of the seventh month *Moral La*, the first day of the tenth month *People’s Year La*, and the *La* day of the twelfth month *Kings and Lords La*. On these five *La* days, it is fitting to observe fasts and offer sacrifices to ancestors. The *Illuminating Perfection Regulations* state: The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month are the ten *Straight Fasting Days*.

On *Gengshen* and *Jiazi* days during the eight festivals, the Eight Spirits of the Great One descend to examine people’s transgressions. By observing fasts, one may delight the Great One. On *Gengshen* days, the Three Corpses within the human body ascend to heaven to report one’s sins. On one’s *Benming* day, the divine officials and soldiers of the body ascend to heaven to tally one’s merits and transgressions. Furthermore, at midnight on *Jiazi* days, at dusk on *Jiaxu* days, the Perfected Officials of the Heavenly Stars descend. At the evening meal on *Jiashen* days, at noon on *Jiawu* days, the Perfected Officials of the Earthly Stars descend. At mealtime on *Jiachen* days, at the first hour of *Yin* days, the Perfected Officials of the Human Stars descend. On these days, the Divine Lords of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways inspect good and evil in their respective directions, reporting all above.

At sunrise on *Dingmao* days, at cockcrow on *Dingchou* days, the Perfected Officials of the Heavenly August descend. At sunset on *Dingyou* days, at the hour of settling in on *Dinghai* days, the Perfected Officials of the Earthly August descend. At the evening meal on *Dingwei* days, at mid-morning on *Dingsi* days, the Perfected Officials of the August of Days descend. On these days, by observing fasts, the Perfected of the Five Peaks each dispatch five spirits to guard and protect, recording names in the registers of immortality.

The *Three Caverns’ Observance of the Dao Regulations* states: The New Year’s Day is the *Offering Longevity Fast*; the seventh day is the *Extending Spirits Fast*; the eighth day of the second month is the *Fragrant Spring Fast*; the eighth day of the fourth month is the *Inaugurating Summer Fast*; the fifth day of the fifth month is the *Continuing Life Fast*; the sixth day of the sixth month is the *Clearing Heat Fast*; the seventh day of the seventh month is the *Welcoming Autumn Fast*; the first day of the eighth month is the *Dispelling Evil Fast*; the ninth day of the ninth month is the *Extending Years Fast*; the first day of the tenth month is the *Completing Blessings Fast*; the fifteenth day of the eleventh month is the *Inaugurating Blessings Fast*; the *La* day of the twelfth month is the *Hundred Blessings Fast*; the twenty-eighth day is the *Welcoming the New Fast*; the *Beginning of Spring* is the *Establishing Goodness Fast*; the *Spring Equinox* is the *Extending Blessings Fast*; the *Beginning of Summer* is the *Prolonging Goodness Fast*; the *Summer Solstice* is the *Vermilion Brightness Fast*; the *Beginning of Autumn* is the *Distant Longevity Fast*; the *Autumn Equinox* is the *Repenting Sins Fast*; the *Beginning of Winter* is the *Following Goodness Fast*; the *Winter Solstice* is the *Expansive Celebration Fast*. Each of these fasts possesses its own scriptural protocols.

Thus, those who study the Dao yet do not observe fasts and precepts labor in vain among the mountains and forests. The essence of fasting lies in purity, emptiness, tranquility, and stillness; in humility, reverence, and trembling caution, as though treading upon ice or a ravine, or standing before a stern lord. With sincere devotion and humble austerity, one must pray for numinous response. Examine and restrain both inner and outer, allowing no clamor or disorder.

Those who perform the fast must strictly avoid those in mourning wearing sackcloth, newly delivered women, women whose menstrual flow has not ceased, and those suffering from sores, scabies, or other debilitating illnesses. None of these may ascend the fast hall, enter the courtyard, approach the altar, or be employed in service. If they earnestly wish to participate in the fast to beseech forgiveness for transgressions, they may submit a written petition to confess and repent, but they must not mingle in the altar hall or participate in the ritual proceedings. They are to be moved to a separate seat, and all six domestic animals are likewise to be kept away. For such persons defile the numinous essence, and the worthies and sages will not descend—thus the fast yields no merit.

In all fasts, the host must be reverent and sincere, and the fast officers must maintain solemn order. Even the lack of proper incense and lamps is deemed negligent, for nothing precedes these in invoking the sagely and beseeching the true. The finest incense is that of aloeswood, sandalwood, and *ni-tan*, blended according to the *Shangqing* method into fragrant pearl pellets, without the use of musk or deer musk. In summoning the true and invoking the numinous, one must maintain utmost purity of intent. For those who dwell in cold hermitages or Daoist practitioners performing fasts who are too poor to obtain such incense, even a small offering suffices as a token of sincerity—one must not allow a complete lack. The use of milk-based incense, however, is not permitted in Daoist practice.

At the commencement of the fast, observe the direction in which the smoke of the burning incense rises—whether toward the east, south, west, or north—and the Five Emperors will arrive accordingly. As the *Dengzhen Yinjue* states: "Incense is what the celestial perfected use to establish communication; earthly spirits rely on it to convey words. This is not merely about the purity of the fast. In prayer, visualization, and focused meditation, one must burn incense, for the golden lads attending the incense will summon the true and convey one’s intentions." The *Dengzhen Yinjue* further says: "The perfected harness the radiance of the sun to illuminate, and command the essence of the moon to brighten the obscure. Thus, the faint glow of the ninefold lamps illuminates the stillness of the eight directions in the night." The *Siji Mingke* states: "At the *Beginning of Spring* and the *Spring Equinox*, light nine lamps in the courtyard; at the *Beginning of Summer* and the *Summer Solstice*, light eight lamps; at the *Beginning of Autumn* and the *Autumn Equinox*, light six lamps; at the *Beginning of Winter* and the *Winter Solstice*, light five lamps; and on one’s natal day, light twelve lamps. From this, one may present petitions, seek forgiveness for transgressions, and pray for blessings, using lamps in the courtyard. The method for arranging the lamps in the courtyard during various fasts is recorded elsewhere."

After completing the seasonal orientation toward the directional sovereigns—except on one’s natal day, when one faces the Year Star—knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite the following prayer:

*"Supreme Perfected, Myriad Sagely Thearchs, Five Emperors, Four Controllers, and all the Perfected Overseers of the Immortals: on this auspicious day, at the opening of the eight seasonal nodes, may yang transgressions and yin judgments be severed, and the nine yin realms be extinguished. By this offering, may the seven mysteries be released, the fiery realms be escaped, and the knife mountains be forever avoided. May the three paths and five sufferings not encumber this body. May I be as one with Heaven and Earth, and eternally preserve the dawn of the Thearch. May the five vows and eight assemblies all be fulfilled as spoken."*

Upon finishing, remove the headscarf and bow one hundred and twenty times, pressing the forehead to the ground without causing pain. Then, replace the scarf, look to the heavens, and silently recite: *"Today, this body receives the grace of Heaven’s favor, is granted the return of its form, and is bestowed the life of a flying immortal."* Conclude by inhaling twenty-four breaths from the heavens, then cease. If practiced thus for three years, all past transgressions will be eradicated, and the body will become as one with the true.

The *Chuzhen Jing* states: "The words of the celestial perfected declare that those who leave the household and transcend the mundane all possess profound karmic affinity from past lives, enabling them to rise above the common multitude. If one remains as vigilant at the end as at the beginning, and refines oneself with utmost dedication, one will bring blessing to seven generations of ancestors and spread joy throughout the entire family. As the saying goes: 'A nine-tiered terrace begins with heaped earth; a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.' Thus, when merit is accomplished and virtue perfected, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight. Therefore, at the time of initiation and transmission, one should receive the precepts of the *Initial Perfected*."

There are ten precepts to be received:

1. **First Precept:** Do not secretly plot harm against others for personal gain. Instead, practice hidden virtue and broadly aid all living beings.
2. **Second Precept:** Do not kill living beings to satisfy the palate. Instead, practice kindness and compassion, extending it even to insects.
3. **Third Precept:** Do not engage in licentiousness or defile the true essence, polluting the numinous qi. Instead, maintain chastity and preserve the primordial integrity.
4. **Fourth Precept:** Do not sabotage others’ achievements or sever their familial bonds. Instead, assist all beings with the Dao, fostering harmony among the nine clans.
5. **Fifth Precept:** Do not slander the worthy or expose others’ faults to exalt oneself. Instead, praise the goodness of others and never boast of one’s own abilities.
6. **Sixth Precept:** Do not overindulge in alcohol or consume forbidden meats. Instead, regulate temperament and qi, and focus solely on purity and emptiness.
7. **Seventh Precept:** Do not be insatiably greedy or hoard wealth without sharing. Instead, practice frugality and compassionately relieve the poor.
8. **Eighth Precept:** Do not associate with the unworthy or dwell in defiled places. Instead, admire those superior to oneself and reside in purity and emptiness.
9. **Ninth Precept:** Do not be disloyal, unfilial, unkind, or untrustworthy. Instead, fulfill one’s duties to ruler and parents, and extend sincerity to all things.
10. **Tenth Precept:** Do not engage in frivolous speech or conduct oneself without authenticity. Instead, maintain gravity, limit words, and prioritize the Dao and virtue.

Those who uphold these ten precepts without fail from beginning to end will be protected by the Dao of Heaven and assisted by the divine spirits. Even the desire for misfortune and calamity will be unattainable. But if one abandons them by evening after adopting them by morning, and neglects the true and upright, one brings misfortune upon oneself—no blame will lie with the exalted numinous. How can those newly entering the Dao not be exhorted to this?

**Morning Audience with the Perfected**
The *Chaozhen Yi* states: On the first and fifteenth days of each month, the Three Origin days, *Gengshen*, *Jiayin*, *Jiazi*, the eight seasonal nodes, the Three Assemblies, and one’s natal day, one must perform the morning audience. However, if these coincide with *Wuchen*, *Wuxu*, the Heavenly Father’s and Heavenly Mother’s killing days, or the Thearch’s killing day, the ritual must not be performed.

For the morning audience, bathe in peach-infused water the day before, as described in the *Jiehui* chapter. Also, avoid consuming onions, leeks, garlic, dairy, and the like. On the appointed day, don clean garments, hold an incense burner, approach the quiet chamber, knock the teeth three times, and softly recite:

Guard the Chamber’s Jade Maidens and the Fourfold Luminants’ Merit Officers—this day I desire to present my morning audience; may my words ascend and be heard above.

Then open the door, stepping first with the right foot, proceed to the incense table, place the burner upon it, hold the tablet upright, and stand evenly. Facing the moon, knock the teeth three times, visualize the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens standing to left and right of the incense table, then kneel fully, pinch incense thrice. When done, rise, stand evenly, and slightly raise the body to invoke the incense burner with seven invocations:

Supreme Mysterious Origin, Fivefold Numinous Venerable Lord, summon now the Merit Officers and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Messengers, the Three Qi Rectifying Spirits—hasten to report above, to the Three Heavens’ Supreme Mysterious Origin Dao Lord: your servant now burns incense in audience with the Perfected, may the Primordial Qi of the Nine Heavens’ True Ones descend into my body, that my words swiftly ascend and reach the Purple Tenuity Palace before the Supreme Mysterious Origin Great Dao Lord.

When finished, rise, visualize the heart as though arriving before the celestial gate, bow twice, then kneel fully again. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and invoke:

Orthodox Unity, Alliance of Might—disciple So-and-so bows his head, entrusting body, spirit, and life.

Before the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Origin Boundless Great Dao Supreme Venerable Lord, Supreme Elder, Heavenly Thearch, Heavenly Elder, Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, Nine Qi Elder, and the myriad layers of Daoic qi; before the twelve hundred palace lords of Supreme Clarity’s Jade Steps—your servant, fortunate to inherit karmic blessings, has been granted the true Dao. Unworthy though I am, I dare aspire to long life, vowing to establish merit, reform transgressions, and cultivate virtue. I beseech forgiveness for all grave and weighty sins committed from past lives until this day, that they be wholly eradicated, allowing me to renew myself and redress past faults.

May the suffering souls of my nine generations of ancestors be delivered from the Nine Dark Realms and ascend to the celestial thoroughfares. May my cultivation of the Dao align with sincere supplication, my name be stricken from the ledgers of death and inscribed in the registers of the Supreme Mystery. May all within my household together preserve primordial auspiciousness, and may the grace of life and completion rest herein.

Disciple So-and-so knocks his head—then use the tablet to knock the head.

Respectfully submitted.

If there are other matters, they may be stated at will, but do not overburden the Perfected.

When finished, bow twice more, then prostrate at the place of ritual, using the tablet to knock the head and clap the cheeks. When done, invoke the incense burner again:

Incense Officials and Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Incense-Bearing Messengers, Three Qi Rectifying Spirits—may this place of audience with the Perfected naturally descend golden liquor, cinnabar jade, and mushroom essences; may the hundred numina and host of Perfected gather before the incense flame. May my cultivation of the Dao align with the utmost truth, my household receive blessings, and the world be enveloped in grace. Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, attend the incense smoke, transmit and present my words directly before the Perfected Thearch.

While burning incense, do not turn to look back, for this disrupts the placement of true qi and invites decline in resonance. Nor should there be clamor, and the ritual must be completed by dawn’s first light.

**Purification and Ablution**
The spirit and qi are pure and void, guarded by true numina. When body and mind are turbid, perverse qi harms the person. To enter stillness and contemplate the true, one must be clean. Without treading the paths of manifold evils, auspiciousness will abide.

After Daoist priests and priestesses receive the precepts, they must especially avoid filth and defilement. All that is inadvisable lies beyond the bounds of permissible conduct. The *Statutes of the Mysterious Metropolis* state: In commoners’ homes, one must not enter where excrement or filth is concealed, except on the last day of the month or the first; where mourning is observed, one is defiled for three days. For those in three years of mourning not yet completed, within a hundred days one must not write talismans, present memorials, perform morning audiences, or enter stillness. Violations deduct twelve years from one’s lifespan.

The Supreme Ultimate Master said: Daoist priests and priestesses, if previously unexposed to filth or mourning, need not avoid weeping, but must wear the register on the body, suspended from the arm. After leaving, bathe in fragrant water to dissolve defilement. Only after three days may one enter stillness.

The *Three Origins’ Precepts of Rank* state: Regularly on the fifteenth days of the first, seventh, and tenth months, and on ordinary days at midnight, bathe by facing the Dipper, ladling fragrant water and turning left thirty-two times. Close the eyes and visualize sunlight above the left eye, moonlight above the right, the five stars’ tassels entwining the body, five-colored clouds as a canopy, and the four numina in attendance. When done, knock the teeth thirty-two times and invoke:

Heaven’s clarity is limpid, the five colors lofty and bright. Sun and moon emit radiance, bathing my form. Divine essences flow within, fragrant waters refine my essence. Light and brilliance pervade, illuminating Supreme Clarity. Qi admits no dust, the five palaces receive the numinous. Sins of the three paths are extinguished, calamities of the nine darknesses dispelled. Evil roots are severed, blessings and felicity arise of themselves. Today’s great vow is proclaimed to all alliances. The body receives liberation, ascending to the imperial court.

When finished, swallow upward thirty-two times, then bathe. Afterward, don cap and sash, and knock the teeth twelve times. Invoke:

The five turbidities are purified, the eight luminants brightened. Today I receive refinement—sins are extinguished, blessings arise. May I long abide with the Five Thearchs, equal in truth to the supreme numina.

Then exit the chamber, enter the room, and proceed with the ritual according to the method.

After each encounter with defilement, one must bathe. To cultivate the true and attain the numinous, one must especially maintain purity; otherwise, illness will abound. The Perfected Officials attending the scriptures tally one’s transgressions.

For ablution with fragrant water, use bamboo leaves, peach branches, cypress leaves, and orchid incense, boiling them in water for ten or more cycles. Strain through a cloth bag to remove dregs, add the five fragrances, and use this for the most refined purification.

Avoid approaching corpses, women in childbirth, or mourning households when fasting. For childbirth, avoid food for three days and until the full month. Do not speak of death or inauspicious matters near funeral carriages, spirit halls, the birth of livestock, holding infants, fetal defilement, or weeping. Before noon, avoid blood, meat, dead fowl, or beasts. When reclining, combing hair, eating, or relieving oneself, never face north.

When relieving oneself, do not gaze upon the Three Luminaries. Avoid consuming the meat of the twelve earthly branches, restless fish, or the five pungent vegetables, and refrain from speaking of them. Women during their menstrual flow must not be approached, nor may one share a room or bed with them, partake in offerings or feasting, or draw near to the Daoist altar. If nocturnal emission occurs, one must also perform purification to dispel defilement.

Upon encountering a corpse or funeral carriage, swiftly visualize fire descending straight from one’s heart to burn them fiercely, reducing the coffin and funeral carriage to ashes, then imagine a fierce wind scattering them. Close your eyes and inwardly visualize the fire consuming all, leaving the body pure and white, the defiled qi dissolved—thus is the purification complete. Alternatively, visualize a Perfected Official wearing the Nine Phoenix Perfected Official’s register upon his head, who takes water into his mouth and sprays it, dissolving the defilement.

To inscribe the talisman for dispelling defilement, write in cinnabar while knocking the teeth thrice. During the writing, hold your breath as the Sun of the August Heavenly Emperor closes. Place the talisman in water, stir the water three times counterclockwise with a knife, and visualize the Northern Dipper within the water. Recite the incantation:

*"Ghosts of a hundred defilements, flee ten thousand leagues—those who do not flee shall be slain. White Youth of the West, swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Then take the water into your mouth and spray it, and the defiled qi will disperse entirely.

On the last day of the year, do not bathe; on the first day of the new year, do not wash your hair. Ordinarily, bathe every five days and wash your hair every ten days, always using peach wood and bamboo. Here ends the first scroll of *The Utmost Sayings*.

**The Utmost Sayings, Scroll Two**
*Composed by Fan Xiuran, Daoist of the Yu Cave of Kuaiji*

### On Nurturing Life

Yan Junping’s *Laozi’s Pointers to the Return* states: Roam the mind in emptiness and stillness, bind the will to the subtle and wondrous, entrust thoughts to desirelessness, and return plans to non-action. Thus can one defy life to extend destiny, befriending the Dao.

The *Divine Farmer’s Classic* says: Those who eat grasses are robust and strong; those who eat meat are fierce, swift, and agile; those who eat grains are wise and discerning; those who eat minerals are plump, lustrous, and ageless—referring to those who refine the Five Minerals. Those who eat fungi live long without dying; those who consume primordial blackness cannot be buried by earth or slain by heaven. Thus, consuming fine medicines aligns one with heaven, guided by the array of sun and moon, abiding in the earth without perishing.

The *Confucian Family Sayings* states: Those who drink water excel at swimming and endure cold, for they subsist on water. Those who eat earth are mindless yet tireless, like earthworms. Those who eat wood possess great strength yet remain untamed, like bears, elephants, and camels. The *Huainanzi* says: "Strong yet unruly, stubborn and untamed." Those who eat mulberry leaves spin threads and become moths. Those who consume qi are spiritually luminous and long-lived—such are the immortals. Those who eat grains are wise yet short-lived—such are humans. Those who eat nothing do not die but become spirits, breathing without thought.

The tradition says: Those who eat indiscriminately are afflicted by the hundred diseases and malevolent spirits. The less one eats, the more the mind opens and the years lengthen; the more one indulges, the more the years diminish.

The *Daoist Mechanism Classic* states: That human lives have long or short spans is not natural—it arises from carelessness in conduct, immoderate eating and drinking, excessive indulgence, defiance of yin and yang, the soul and spirit unguarded, essence depleted, and life force waning until illness sprouts. Thus, one cannot fulfill one’s allotted years.

Laozi said to Wenzi: In governing the body, the highest way is to nurture form, keeping the spirit clear and the mind at peace, so all joints are tranquil—this is the root of nurturing life. Nourishing the flesh, filling the belly, and indulging desires are but the branches of nurturing life. Those who cultivate the root regulate sleep and dwelling, moderate food and drink, harmonize joy and anger, and adapt movement and stillness. What lies within is mastered, and defiled blackness has no way to enter. Adorning the exterior harms the interior; gratifying emotions injures the spirit; prizing ornament obscures the true. Thus, beautiful feathers harm the bones, and lush branches damage the roots. Therefore, stillness, silence, and detachment nurture life; harmony, joy, and emptiness uphold virtue. Externally undisturbed, the inner nature finds its proper place; still and unmoved, harmonious, the spirit finds its peace. This is called nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to endure the years—truly embodying the Dao.

The *Mysterious Wondrous Inner Treatise*: Laozi said, When the qi of Wood arrives, the bones and joints strengthen; when the qi of Earth arrives, the flesh and skin fill; when the qi of Metal arrives, the teeth and nails become firm; when the qi of Fire arrives, the five limbs grow warm; when the qi of Water arrives, moisture and luster abound; when the qi of Wind arrives, breath flows freely, circulating through the body. When the qi of Wind retreats, breath departs; when the qi of Water retreats, moisture dries; when the qi of Fire retreats, warmth ceases; when the qi of Metal retreats, the teeth weaken; when the qi of Earth retreats, the flesh and skin grow hollow; when the qi of Wood retreats, the bones and joints decay. Diligently guide qi and nurture nature to preserve the Six Harmonies.

Laozi’s *Western Ascension Scripture* says: The false Dao nurtures form; the true Dao nurtures spirit. The true spirit connects with the Dao, able to vanish or endure. The spirit can make the body fly and even move mountains. When the body turns to ash and dust, what awareness remains? It also says: Loving others is not as good as loving oneself; loving oneself is not as good as loving the spirit; loving the spirit is not as good as relinquishing the spirit; relinquishing the spirit is not as good as guarding the body. Guarding the body ensures long endurance and eternal existence. Thus, spirit is born from form, and form is shaped by spirit. Without spirit, form cannot live; without form, spirit cannot take shape. Form and spirit unite, alternately generating and completing each other. The spirit constantly loves humanity, yet humanity does not love the spirit. Thus, abandoning sagacity and discarding cunning to return to the origin is the way.

It also says: The sage is ever at peace, harmonizing with heaven and earth, communing with ghosts and spirits. The multitude may be at peace, yet the sage remains undisturbed. For the Dao of heaven despises fullness and fills the empty, destroys the strong and aids the weak, diminishes overthinking to return to childlike simplicity, and blocks perverse wisdom. The sage’s simplicity is such that the world reveres filial piety—this is nurturing the mother. Constantly loving one’s mother ensures long life.

The *River Chart: The Emperor’s Gaze on Sprouts* says: Defying heaven and earth brings misfortune; following the seasons brings fortune. In spring and summer, delight in high mountains; in autumn and winter, dwell low and deep in seclusion. This brings good fortune, abundant blessings, and boundless longevity.

The *Luo Book: Treasured Life* says: The ancients’ methods for curing illness involved harmonizing with sweet springs and moistening with medicinal qi—neither pungent nor bitter, sweet and flavorful. Regular consumption causes fluids to flow through the five viscera, connecting to the heart and lungs, ensuring lifelong freedom from illness.

The *Lesser Possession Scripture* says: Think little, contemplate little, desire little, act little, speak little, laugh little, grieve little, rejoice little, delight little, anger little, prefer little, detest little. Practicing these twelve "littles" is the comprehensive contract for nurturing life. Excessive thought wearies the spirit; excessive contemplation scatters the will; excessive desire harms wisdom; excessive action exhausts the body; excessive speech provokes qi; excessive laughter injures the viscera; excessive grief startles the heart; excessive joy overflows the mind; excessive delight causes confusion and chaos; excessive anger unsettles the hundred vessels; excessive preference leads to obsession and disorder; excessive detestation brings emaciation and sorrow.

These twelve excesses, if not eliminated, are the root of losing one’s life. Only those without excess approach the true person.

The *Greater Possession Scripture* states: Some doubt, saying: "All begin equally from the primordial substance, ultimately receive qi from yin and yang, bear form and po within heaven and earth, and depend on food and breath for growth—yet there are the foolish and the wise, the strong and the weak, the long-lived and the short-lived. Is this heaven’s doing? Or man’s?"

One who resolves this says: The formation of body determines foolishness or wisdom—this is heaven. Strength or weakness, long life or early death—this is man. The Dao of heaven is natural; the Dao of man is self-made. Those whose fetal qi is full and abundant, who at birth receive ample nourishment, in youth lack excess in rich flavors, and in maturity practice restraint in sound and sensuality—these grow strong and live long. Those whose fetal qi is depleted and spent, who at birth lack sufficient nourishment, in youth indulge in rich flavors, and in maturity give free rein to sound and sensuality—these grow weak and die young. If one’s growth is complete and harmonious, and further nurtured by the Dao, one’s years cannot be measured.

The Grand Historian Sima Tan said: The spirit is the root of life; the body is the vessel of life. When the spirit is overused, it is exhausted; when the body is overworked, it is worn out. If spirit and body are restless, desiring to last as long as heaven and earth is unheard of. Thus, what gives man life is the spirit; what the spirit relies upon is the body. When the spirit departs, death follows—once dead, one cannot be revived; once departed, one cannot return. Therefore, the sage values this deeply.

The Dao of nurturing life has a comprehensive guiding principle. Though one may not yet grasp its every subtlety, simply reflecting that it opposes common custom—opposing custom brings hidden victory—yields more than half its benefit. Should those with aspiration not examine this?

The Green Ox Daoist Feng Junda said: The method of nurturing nature can be applied. In general: the body should be regularly active, but not excessively; food should be consistently moderate, but not overly sparse. Avoid rich and greasy foods, limit salt and sour flavors, calm thoughts, reduce joy and anger, abandon reckless pursuits, be cautious in the bedchamber, discharge in spring and summer, and store in autumn and winter—then one may approach the Dao.

Hu Zhao of Yingchuan, styled Kongming, said: Ordinary people cannot entirely avoid desires, nor can they live without affairs. They should harmonize the mind, restrain thoughts, quiet the body, and reduce external attachments. First, eliminate what disturbs the spirit and violates nature—this is one technique for conserving the spirit.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Central Classic* states: Those endowed with the qi of the five constants have either a tranquil or restless nature, and their hard or soft dispositions cannot be altered. The tranquil must not be made restless, nor the restless made tranquil. Each has its own nature; violating it loses its proper measure, while indulging it harms life. Thus, the flaw of the tranquil lies in being uncommunicative, while the flaw of the restless lies in being imprecise. The Dao of nurturing life lies in respecting one’s nature and following its measure, adjusting with restraint or encouragement as needed, gradually increasing or decreasing—then each attains its proper state. Yet the tranquil tend to live long, while the restless tend to die young. The tranquil who cannot nurture may not live long, while the restless who can nurture may extend their years. However, the tranquil are easy to guide, while the restless are difficult to manage. Those who fully attend to proper nurturing can cultivate both the tranquil and the restless.

Hair is the outlet of blood; teeth are the outlet of bone; nails are the outlet of sinew. Combing the hair a thousand times keeps it from turning white; tapping the teeth morning and night keeps them from decaying; not frequently trimming the nails keeps the sinews from weakening.

The *Central Classic* states: Speech and laughter should be kept to a minimum; one should not raise the voice. One should empty the heart and humble oneself, not competing with others. Excessive speech and laughter damage the lungs and injure the kidneys, unsettling the spirit. Specifically: too much speech harms the lungs and dries the mouth; too much laughter strains the kidneys and causes lower back pain—these are its effects. Those who hunt, capture, or wrestle, and laugh heartily afterward, may sever their visceral qi. Even if no immediate harm is felt, illness may arise one or two years later, beyond the cure of even a skilled physician.

The five grains nourish the body but cannot extend life; the hundred medicines treat illness and prolong years but cannot fully sustain it. What fully sustains the body is prized by the common people, while what extends life is treasured by the Dao.

From the *Plain Questions*: The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: "I have heard that in high antiquity, people lived to a hundred years with undiminished vigor, their blood and qi still robust. Yet today, people reach only half that age before their strength declines. Is this due to changes in the times? Or have people lost the way?"

Qi Bo replied: "In high antiquity, those who understood the Dao modeled themselves on yin and yang, harmonized with the arts of defense and cultivation, and practiced regulated methods in the bedchamber. They ate and drank in moderation, rose and retired at regular hours, and did not recklessly exhaust themselves. Thus, their form and spirit remained united, and they fulfilled their natural lifespan, living to a hundred years. Today’s people are not so: they take wine as their drink, recklessness as their norm, enter the bedchamber drunk, exhaust their essence with desire, dissipate their true qi, fail to maintain fullness, do not timely manage their spirit, seek only to gratify their hearts, and act contrary to the joy of life. Their rising and resting lack restraint—thus, they decline by fifty.

The Yellow Emperor said: "I have heard that the sages of high antiquity discussed the principles of the human form, distinguishing the viscera and bowels, correcting the channels and vessels, aligning the meridians with the six conjunctions, each following its proper path, with qi points emerging at their respective locations, each having its division and sequence, its order and logic. The patterns of the four seasons and yin-yang all have their regularities, and the correspondence between external and internal has its outer and inner aspects. Is this truly so?"

Qi Bo replied: "The methods of the sages of high antiquity were universally practiced. They avoided pernicious winds and injurious qi at the proper times, maintained a state of tranquil emptiness, with a sincere heart following the true qi, and guarded their spirit within—how could illness arise? Thus, their minds were at ease and unafraid, their bodies labored without weariness, and their qi and desires followed their wishes."

Thus, they savored their food, wore what suited them, delighted in their customs, and neither high nor low envied one another—hence their people remained unadorned. Therefore, desires could not strain their eyes, depravity could not confuse their hearts, and neither the worthy nor the foolish were swayed by external things, for they accorded with the Dao’s principles. Thus, they could live to a hundred years with undiminished vigor, for their virtue was whole and unassailed.

*The Yellow Emperor’s Needling Canon* asks: "May I hear of the ways of perverse excess and floating dissipation?"
Qi Bo replied: "Pernicious influences invade from without, each entering at a fixed abode. When they counterflow into the viscera, they course with the constructive and defensive qi, stirring the hun and po to flight, causing one to find no peace even in dreams. When qi counterflows into the bowels, there is excess without and deficiency within; when it counterflows into the viscera, there is excess within and deficiency without. When yin qi prevails, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi prevails, one dreams of traversing scorching flames in passion. When both yin and yang are abundant, one dreams of mutual rescue. When qi is exuberant above, one dreams of flying; when exuberant below, one dreams of falling. Overfullness leads to dreams of giving; extreme hunger, to dreams of taking. When the liver is exuberant, one dreams of rage; when the lungs are exuberant, of fear and flight; when heart qi is exuberant, of joy, laughter, and dread; when spleen qi is exuberant, of singing, mirth, heaviness, and immobility; when kidney qi is exuberant, of the waist and spine being sundered.

When counterflow qi lodges in the heart, one dreams of mountains and hills ablaze. When it lodges in the lungs, one dreams of flight, of gold and iron, or strange objects. When it lodges in the liver, one dreams of mountains and forests. When it lodges in the spleen, one dreams of hills, marshes, collapsing houses, and wind and rain. When it lodges in the kidneys, one dreams of standing at an abyss or drowning in water. When it lodges in the bladder, one dreams of travel. When it lodges in the stomach, one dreams of eating and drinking. When it lodges in the large intestine, one dreams of fields and wilds. When it lodges in the small intestine, one dreams of crowded cities and streets. When it lodges in the gallbladder, one dreams of fighting, litigation, or self-mutilation. When it lodges in the yin organs, one dreams of sexual union. When it lodges in the nape, one dreams of decapitation. When it lodges in the calves, one dreams of walking without progress or dwelling in deep pits. When it lodges in the thighs and arms, one dreams of bowing and kneeling. When it lodges in the bladder, one dreams of urination.

The Yellow Emperor said: "In the three months of spring, this is called 'issuing the old.' Heaven and earth together bring forth life, and the myriad things flourish. One retires late and rises early, strolls in the courtyard with unbound hair and relaxed form to encourage the growth of the will. Give life and do not kill, bestow and do not seize, reward and do not punish—this is the response to spring qi and the Dao of nurturing life. To go against it injures the liver, leading to cold damage in summer and diminished support for growth.

In the three months of summer, this is called 'luxuriant flowering.' Heaven and earth qi intermingle, and the myriad things bear fruit. One retires late and rises early, never tiring of the sun, keeping the will free of anger, allowing blossoms to reach fullness, and enabling qi to vent as if what one loved were external—this is the response to summer qi and the Dao of fostering growth. To go against it injures the heart, leading to malarial disorders in autumn and diminished support for harvest, with severe illness at the winter solstice.

In the three months of autumn, this is called 'balanced containment.' Heaven’s qi grows urgent, earth’s qi grows bright. One retires early and rises early, rising with the crows, calming the will to ease the form, gathering in the spirit and qi to harmonize autumn qi, not scattering the will outward, and keeping lung qi clear—this is the response to autumn qi and the Dao of nurturing harvest. To go against it injures the lungs, leading to unchecked diarrhea in winter and diminished support for storage.

In the three months of winter, this is called 'closing and storing.' Water freezes and earth cracks, and one does not disturb the yang. One retires early and rises late, awaiting the sun’s light, keeping the will as if hidden, as if harboring private thoughts, as if having gained something, shunning cold and seeking warmth, not leaking skin qi or allowing qi to be exhausted—this is the response to winter qi and the Dao of nurturing storage. To go against it injures the kidneys, leading to atrophy and counterflow in spring and diminished support for generation.

Thus, the sage follows these principles, and so the body is free of illness, the myriad things do not lose their place, and generative qi does not run dry. To go against spring qi means lesser yang will not arise, and liver qi will internally transform; to go against summer qi means greater yang will not grow, and heart qi will internally hollow; to go against autumn qi means greater yin will not gather, and lung qi will scorch and distend; to go against winter qi means lesser yin will not store, and kidney qi will become turbid and sunken.

The four seasons and yin-yang are the root qi of the myriad things. Therefore, the sage nurtures yang in spring and summer and stores yin in autumn and winter, following the root and thus floating and sinking with the myriad things in the gate of generation and growth.

The liver’s color is green, and it is fitting to eat salty foods—black soybeans, pork, and chestnuts are all salty. The heart’s color is red, and it is fitting to eat sour foods—hempseed, dog meat, and plums are all sour. The lungs’ color is white, and it is fitting to eat sweet foods—rice, beef, and jujubes are all sweet. The spleen’s color is yellow, and it is fitting to eat bitter foods—wheat, mutton, and apricots are all bitter. The kidneys’ color is black, and it is fitting to eat acrid foods—yellow millet, chicken, and peaches are all acrid.

Acrid scatters, sour gathers, sweet moderates, bitter firms, and salty moistens. All toxic medicines attack pernicious influences; the five grains nourish, the five fruits assist, the five domestic animals benefit, and the five flavors combined in consumption augment essence and qi. These five flavors—acrid, sweet, bitter, salty, and sour—each have their benefits: some scatter, some gather, some moderate, some firm, some moisten. These are the illnesses of the four seasons and five viscera, and the flavors to which they are suited.

Prolonged seeing injures the blood, prolonged lying injures qi, prolonged standing injures the bones, prolonged walking injures the sinews, and prolonged sitting injures the flesh—these are the five taxations and their injuries.

As for those of high rank and power, even if they are not struck by pernicious influences, their spirit is internally damaged, and their bodies will surely perish."

Not from malevolent forces striking from without, but from the internal clotting of ice and fire—thus comes collapse within, blood vomited forth, and death. Those who rise to wealth then fall to poverty, though untouched by pernicious influences, will find their skin withered, sinews contracted, limbs withered and twisted, and their inner being reduced to servitude.

For mortals, the harm of wealth and poverty is yet lighter than that of power and rank, and so their afflictions remain confined to the body alone. As for nurturing one’s nature, one must cultivate habits until they become second nature, so that one’s nature becomes inherently good, and without cultivation, nothing will fail to benefit. Once one’s nature is inherently good, external ailments will not arise, and calamities will not occur—this is the great principle of nurturing one’s nature.

Those who excel at nurturing their nature thus treat the illness before it takes form. Therefore, nurturing one’s nature does not lie solely in consuming elixirs or feeding on mist; it rests in the fullness of the Five Constants and the completeness of the hundred virtues. Even without elixirs or medicinal brews, this is sufficient to prolong one’s years. If virtue and conduct are not fulfilled, even jade wine and golden cinnabar cannot extend one’s lifespan.

Thus the *Daodejing* says: "One who travels by land fears neither tigers nor rhinoceroses"—this is the protection of the Dao and virtue, not something attained by consuming elixirs to seek long life! The sage concocts medicines to save those without conduct. Those who do not awaken to their faults will cling to illness for years without cultivating a single virtue; bound by sickness until their teeth fall out, they will never feel remorse. This is why Qibo and He wandered long, while Peng and Ancestor passed swiftly—there is indeed reason for it.

Ji Kang said: "In nurturing life, there are five difficulties: the first is not relinquishing fame and profit; the second, not eliminating joy and anger; the third, not forsaking sound and beauty; the fourth, not cutting off rich flavors; the fifth, not scattering the spirit and dissipating essence. If these five remain, even if one’s heart yearns for old age, recites the profoundest words, savors the finest essences, and breathes in the sun’s radiance, one cannot reverse one’s course and will not escape an early death. But if these five are expelled from the heart, then trust and compliance will grow daily, the Dao and virtue will become complete, spirits will aid without prayer, and long life will come without seeking. This, too, is the great principle of nurturing life."

Yet some embrace benevolence and righteousness without the burden of excessive devotion—are they not also worthy? It is said:

Qibo said:

At forty, one begins to nurture life, for yin and qi are already half-depleted, and daily movements have waned. At fifty, the body grows heavy, and ears and eyes lose their sharpness. At sixty, yin withers, qi greatly declines, the nine orifices become unruly, lower deficiency and upper excess prevail, and tears and mucus flow freely. Thus it is said: "Those who understand grow strong; those who do not, grow old." It is also said: "They emerge together yet bear different names." The wise perceive their unity; the foolish, their difference. The foolish are ever deficient; the wise, ever abundant—so their ears and eyes remain keen, their bodies light and strong, and though aged, they retain the vigor of youth, while the young grow ever more refined. Therefore, the sage acts through non-action, attends to no affairs, and delights in the realm of tranquility, emptiness, and primal qi. Indulging desires and gratifying the will, they hold fast to the state of emptiness and nothingness, and so their lifespan knows no bounds, enduring as long as heaven and earth. This is how the sage tends to the body.

The Perfected One says: Even if one takes elixirs but does not know how to nurture one’s nature and protect life, one can hardly attain long life. The Way of nurturing nature abhors eating to fullness and then lying down, or sitting for long stretches throughout the day, for these all shorten life. One should engage in light labor but avoid exhaustion and tasks beyond one’s capacity. After eating, one ought to walk, pacing leisurely in a set pattern to aid digestion. Thus, flowing water does not stagnate, nor does a door hinge rot—because they are in motion. One must not eat at night; after a meal, one should walk about, covering a distance of ten *li* or so. Eating to fullness and then lying down breeds a hundred illnesses, for the food does not disperse and over time forms accumulations. Eat little but often; do not consume large amounts at once, for it is hard to digest. Always aim for a state between fullness and hunger, hunger and fullness.

Those who excel at nurturing their nature eat only when hungry and drink only when thirsty. After eating, they walk; after walking, they have someone massage their abdomen with powder for several hundred strokes, which aids digestion and greatly benefits the body, sharpening the appetite and preventing illness. At night, keep the mouth closed, for if it opens, qi escapes and evil enters. When lying down, curl the knees and sleep on the side; do not lie stiff like a corpse. Beware of this!

Some seek pleasure and follow their inclinations, claiming to be enlightened and resigned to fate, dismissing the extraordinary as mere orthodoxy, and indulging their passions without restraint. Those who do not seek longevity may hear these words as fleeting as the wind or passing as lightning, beyond comprehension. Though their bodies wither in dissipation and their qi is exhausted amid sensual entanglements, they remain content—how can one speak to them of nurturing nature? Not only will they not accept it, but they will call it heresy. Expecting them to believe is like offering a mirror to the blind or music to the deaf.

*Baopuzi* says: The human body is like a kingdom. The chest and abdomen are its palace halls; the four limbs, its borders; the joints, its officials; the spirit, its ruler; the blood, its ministers; and qi, its people. Thus, one who can govern the people can rule the kingdom. Loving the people secures the kingdom; loving qi preserves the body. When the people scatter, the kingdom falls; when qi is exhausted, the form dies. The dead cannot be revived, nor the lost restored. Therefore, the utmost person eliminates dangers before they arise, treats illness before it manifests, and heals before matters escalate, rather than chasing after what has already passed. The people are hard to nurture yet easy to endanger; qi is hard to purify yet easy to muddy. Thus, one must carefully wield virtue to protect the state, curb desires to fortify blood and qi, and then the True Unity will reside within, the Three and Seven will be guarded, a hundred harms will be repelled, and lifespan will be extended.

From fifty to a hundred, keep fine medicines close at hand, let good words never leave your lips, and let wayward thoughts not cross your mind. Always approach all things with profound sincerity and reverence. Never feign goodness to please others.

The *Daoji Jing* states: "If the pillow is too high, the liver contracts; if too low, the lungs sag. Four inches is the proper height. The pillow and mat should be soft, allowing the breath to lengthen."

The *Daolin Pin* and *Guanmen Jing* say: "For circulating qi, the pillow should be two and a half inches high."

The *Taiqing Jing* records in its lower scroll, "Divine Pillow Method": "On the fifth day of the fifth month or the seventh day of the seventh month, take cypress from the mountains and forests to make a pillow, one foot two inches long and four inches high, hollowed to hold one *dou* and two *sheng*, with a width of three inches and five *fen*. Use red-hearted cypress for the lid, four *fen* thick. On the lid, make three rows, each with forty holes, totaling one hundred twenty holes, each large enough to hold a grain of millet. Then place the medicines inside for use."

The ingredients are:
Peony root, Chinese angelica, angelica root, magnolia flower, *duheng*, *shansu*, *gaoben*, magnolia bark, cistanche, cypress seed, *cangzhu*, *lianwu*, coltsfoot flower, dictamnus root, Sichuan pepper, cinnamon bark, dried ginger, *feilian*, *fangfeng*, ginseng, platycodon, *bailian*, *jishi*, and Sichuan peppercorn—twenty-four ingredients corresponding to the twenty-four qi.

Additionally, eight toxic medicines are added to correspond to the eight winds:
Aconite, monkshood, *hualu*, gleditsia, madder, *yushi*, pinellia, and asarum—totaling thirty-two ingredients.

All are cut and mixed, with the toxic medicines placed beneath the fragrant herbs. Fill the pillow in order, then enclose it in a cloth bag to cover the pillow.

After one hundred days of using the pillow, sinews and bones become strong, and the face gains radiance. After one year, the entire body emits fragrance. After four years, white hair turns black, and fallen teeth regrow.

Always prepare a separate silk bag; when rising or resting, cover the pillow to prevent qi from leaking. Replace the medicines annually, ensuring the thirty-two ingredients total one *dou* and two *sheng*. Each ingredient should yield three *ge*, seven *gui*, eight *cuo*, and four-fifths of a *fen* of powder. Since medicines vary in weight and density, adjust quantities according to their lightness or heaviness.

According to the *Dasan* school’s measurements for one *dan* of medicine:
- Wood: ten taels and six *zhu* yields one *sheng* and four *ge*
- Dried ginger: three taels and twenty *zhu* yields five *ge*
- Cinnamon bark: three taels and fourteen *zhu* yields five *ge*
- *Fangfeng*: two taels and four *zhu* yields four *ge*
- Platycodon: two taels and nine *zhu* yields four *ge*
- Ginseng: one tael and twenty *zhu* yields three *ge*
- Scutellaria: seventeen *zhu* yields one *ge*
- Asarum: one tael and twenty-one *zhu* yields three *ge*
- Monkshood: nineteen *zhu* yields one *ge*
- Poria: eighteen *zhu* yields one *ge*
- *Yushi*: one tael and six *zhu* yields one *ge*
- Oyster shell: sixteen *zhu* yields one *ge*

These are the traditional proportions for various medicines, which should be carefully measured according to the prescribed formula for the pillow.

**Prohibitions and Taboos**

Wang Minshan’s *On Nurturing Life* states: Illness enters through the mouth—moderation is the proper method; life’s toil disrupts tranquility—cultivating the Dao refines one’s nature; sour and salty flavors taken in due season—this is the etiquette of medicine; tonification and purgation according to constitution—this is the clarity of the *Materia Medica*. Through regulated diet, life is prolonged; through medicine, destiny is extended—this much is evident.

Bracken and water bamboo harm the sinews; garlic and leeks injure the blood; raw meats deplete qi; onions agitate the spirit—these are the clear warnings of life’s principles. Mugwort, *fú* (the sprouts of rehmannia), burdock, *niúláo*, and alfalfa—these four are essential for sustaining the body. Whether to withdraw or advance depends on restraint in thought; whether to progress or halt lies in steadfast resolve.

All five pungent herbs impair medicinal efficacy and further cloud one’s spirit and qi. Peaches, plums, *yún* (rapeseed), *tái* (mustard greens), garlic, and leeks are unsuitable for men—even in moderation, they should be gradually reduced. Those under forty should not consume tonifying pills or powders exclusively, for their yin qi remains insufficient while yang qi still flourishes. Special caution is warranted; only those tonics that gently harmonize and promote circulation may be used.

After the hour of *yǒu* (5–7 p.m.), one should not eat or drink. In winter, when nights are long and one’s constitution is naturally warm, consume only small amounts of warm, soft foods. After eating, move about to aid digestion; otherwise, beriberi may develop. At the onset of spring, do not remove winter garments too early, lest one suffer cold, cholera, indigestion, or headaches.

When sweating from exertion in the heat, avoid washing the body or rinsing the mouth, as this dries the five viscera and depletes bodily fluids. Do not sleep with a lamp nearby or cover the head and face, nor breathe with the mouth open. In winter or summer, avoid resting the head on cold objects such as metal or stone, as this dims the eyesight.

The *Baopuzi* states: Someone asked, “Is it in matters of lust that one incurs harm?” The reply: “How could it be limited to this alone? Yet the essence of longevity lies in the art of the bedchamber. The superior practitioner, knowing this, may extend life and dispel illness; the next best avoids self-injury. If one is still young and robust, yet understands how to return the cinnabar of yin to replenish the brain and gather the seven fluids from the *chánggǔ*, even without consuming medicinal substances, one may live three hundred years—though not achieve immortality. Those ignorant of this art are like one who rejects boiling water with ice or kindles fire within a feathered bundle. Moreover:

- Straining beyond one’s capacity in thought harms;
- Exerting strength beyond one’s limit harms;
- Deep sorrow and heavy affliction harm;
- Grief and emaciation harm;
- Excessive joy harms;
- Relentless pursuit of desires harms;
- Lingering worries harm;
- Prolonged talking and laughter harm;
- Irregular sleep harms;
- Drawing bows and crossbows harms;
- Drunken vomiting harms;
- Eating to fullness before exertion harms;
- Running until breathless harms;
- Shouting in joy or weeping in sorrow harms;
- Lack of union between yin and yang harms.

When yang accumulates to its limit, exhaustion follows—and exhaustion leads to death, for this is not the Way. Thus, the methods of nurturing life prescribe: Do not spit at a distance; do not walk with hurried steps; do not strain the ears to listen; do not overtax the eyes with gazing; do not sit until fatigued; do not lie down with excessive caution (for *shèn* here means rigidity or stiffness). Dress before the cold arrives; remove layers before the heat sets in. Do not eat when ravenously hungry; do not drink when parched. Do not overeat—excess food leads to accumulations and stagnation; excess drink forms phlegm and concretions.

Avoid extreme exertion; avoid excessive idleness. Do not sweat profusely; do not spit frequently. Do not gallop on horseback or run in haste; do not gaze into the far distance; do not consume much raw or cold food; do not drink wine while exposed to wind; do not bathe too often; do not harbor grand ambitions or distant aspirations; do not pursue strange and elaborate crafts. In winter, avoid excessive warmth; in summer, avoid extreme cold. Do not sleep beneath the stars; do not fan oneself when outdoors. Do not expose yourself to bitter cold, scorching heat, fierce winds, or heavy dew.

Do not favor any of the five flavors excessively—for sourness in excess harms the spleen; bitterness in excess harms the lungs; pungency in excess harms the liver; saltiness in excess harms the heart; sweetness in excess harms the kidneys. This is the natural principle of the five phases. Though such harms may not be immediately apparent, over time they diminish longevity.

Thus, those skilled in nurturing life rise and retire in accordance with the seasons’ rhythms, maintain harmonious routines in daily life, practice proper stretching and bending for the sinews and bones, employ techniques of swallowing and exhaling to ward off pernicious influences, regulate the circulation of *ying* and *wei* with tonifying and purging methods, and balance exertion and rest with timely moderation. They restrain anger to nourish yin qi and temper joy to nourish yang qi. Only then do they first employ herbs to remedy deficiencies, ingest golden elixirs to secure boundless vitality—and in this, the Way of nurturing life is complete.

The Yellow Emperor said: The daily taboo—do not eat to fullness at night. The monthly taboo—do not become heavily intoxicated at dusk. The yearly taboo—do not travel far at nightfall. The lifelong taboo—do not burn candles at night. In the bedchamber, do not harbor resentment afterward to vent grievances.

Avoid all warm foods and wines that, when held up to the light, cast no shadow—consuming them invites sudden illness. If one has already eaten and feels abdominal distension, purge immediately with medicine. After eating salty or hot foods, do not drink cold water or undiluted wine, lest one lose their voice.

Wine may harmonize various medicinal substances. For those practicing qi absorption and grain avoidance, or those with preexisting conditions requiring purgative medicine, drinking two or three cups may promote smooth circulation. But excessive drinking leads to extreme intoxication, harboring toxins that rot the intestines, dissolve the spleen, corrode the marrow, and scorch the sinews—damaging longevity, clouding the five emotions, and demanding strict avoidance.

Han Rong of Yingchuan, styled Yuanchang, said: “Wine is the flower of the five grains, the ultimate in flavor. It can benefit man, yet it can also harm him.”

If one has taken powdered medicine to the point of fullness and then experiences hunger or weakness, or encounters wind, cold, mist, or dew, regulate the dosage and drink accordingly to disperse pathogenic qi, repel wind, and resist cold. No remedy proves more effective than wine.

Yet those who nourish the blood and cultivate their nature must exercise caution. Wine lends false vigor—while sober, one lacks the will or ability, but when drunk, one forces actions beyond their means. With prolonged habit, tolerance grows, and consumption increases. The heat of wine, though not immediately felt in the abdomen, gradually weakens the body’s qi, muddles the spirit, and brings harm to one’s nature and life.

One must never sleep with the head facing north, nor leave a lamp burning outside, lest the hun and po souls and the Six Spirits grow restless, leading to sorrow and fear. Do not eat or urinate while facing north. Prolonged sitting or contemplation in that direction invites misfortune. Upon rising, do not spit or curse while facing north, for this offends the spirit of the Northern Dipper. Do not don robes or sashes while facing north.

Do not glare at the sun or moon, lest it cause blindness. After heavy sweating, do not remove clothing, or one may suffer from hemiplegia. When eating hot food causes sweating, avoid drafts, or it may induce convulsions, headaches, or excessive tearing. Do not sing while sleeping, for it is inauspicious upon waking. Do not speak loudly outdoors, as it depletes qi and strength.

While sleeping, do not place a brazier near the head, for the fire’s fumes may redden the eyes, dry the nose, and dim the vision. In winter, keep the feet warm and the head cool; in spring and autumn, keep both feet and head cool—this is the constant Dao of the sage.

Upon rising each day, do not harbor careless thoughts. When descending from a forest, do not shout or curse, speak harshly, or lift a foot toward a fire while cursing. Do not sigh or lament with sounds of despair, for this invites misfortune—strictly avoid it. Do not sit with knees drawn up and arms crossed over them. Do not let hair cover the face, for these are inauspicious.

Each morning, listen to some virtuous matter. If you hear something ill, spit toward the direction it came from—this brings good fortune. Upon waking from a nightmare, do not recount it. Instead, take water in your mouth, face east, and spray it out while saying: *"May the evil dream cling to grass and trees; may the good dream become treasure and jade."* Then no misfortune will follow.

When ascending a forest, first remove the left shoe. When traveling far by carriage or horse, do not look back, lest the spirit depart from the body.

All living creatures, no matter how small or flying, must not be wantonly killed or harmed. As for tortoises and snakes, these two creatures possess numinous power, unlike other species. If one inadvertently kills a numinous being, or if the yin essence harms a person, one must be especially cautious. Never travel far in dense yin mist.

Whenever walking, coming, or sitting outside, always visualize the Dipper’s *Kui* and *Cheng* stars positioned above your head—all directions will then be auspicious. Do not consume the flesh of your parents, siblings, or those sharing your own life destiny, for this causes the hun and po souls to scatter, and the household will bear unfilial and undutiful offspring.

Upon rising in the morning, if you mistakenly put on your clothes inside out, consider it auspicious and wear them as they are—no harm will come. If your clothes emit a glow, shake them three times while saying: *"Misfortune depart, misfortune depart!"*—then no harm will follow. Do not block wells or water channels, lest it cause blindness.

After noon, when yin qi arises, do not wash your hair, for it leads to heart deficiency, excessive sweating, profuse dreaming, and head wind. When crossing a stream where sand fleas or water leeches dwell, do not bathe in the water. If you must cross, wait until donkeys or horses have passed first. There are archers who shoot at shadows, causing instant death. First strike the water with an object to trigger the water leeches; once they have struck, cross quickly without fear.

Where mountains have black soil and springs emerge, do not reside long, for constant consumption causes emaciation, joylessness, and sudden outbreaks of sores. In mountains with cavities where copper or treasures have been mined, only the third and ninth months are permissible—other months, the mountain’s qi is closed, and entering leads to sudden death.

Laozi’s *Yangsheng Jing* states: When eating, never bend over your food—it is inauspicious. Do not let sweat drip into your meal, for it harms the person. Eating cold things causes toothache; eating hot things scorches the lips. After eating, rub your abdomen two or three hundred times to dispel the hundred diseases.

Mercury must not come near the teeth, for it causes swelling, hair loss, and tooth decay. Alum must not be ingested raw, as it ruptures the heart and liver. When taking immortal elixirs, always face your life destiny while consuming them. Afterward, do not speak of death, funerals, or inauspicious matters, lest you offend the fetal spirit and render the elixir useless. When taking divine medicines, do not face north; do not take medicine on *hai* or *zi* days.

Master Shen Yi’s oral instructions state: Daoists, when tying their hair, arranging their appearance, eating, or engaging in any activity—including wearing shoes, using pillows, or lying on mats—must not let those outside the Dao see or violate these practices.

Master Chen Anshi’s oral instructions state: When consuming medicinal substances, avoid garlic, pomegranate seeds, pork, and dog meat.

Master Huangshi Gong’s oral instructions state: Do not chew cinnamon daily, for it damages the bones and tendons. Do not encounter foul corpses on an empty stomach, as corpse qi enters the spleen, causing a white membrane to form on the tongue, persistent bad breath, and a slight improvement if one drinks a little wine beforehand—though it is best to avoid such encounters entirely.

Eating hot food while still chilled from cold causes piercing wind. Washing your hair after a full meal causes head wind. Covering food with copper vessels allows sweat to drip into the food, producing malignant *nanyang* sores.

Zhang Heng, styled Pingzi, said: At the winter solstice, yang qi returns, and hot foods in the stomach digest easily. At the summer solstice, yin qi lurks, and foods in the spleen digest with difficulty. Do not consume foods that herald the changing seasons, for untimely eating harms one’s nature and shortens life.

Chen Ji of Yingchuan, styled Yuanfang, said: The sudden onset of the hundred diseases and premature death often stem from the perils of diet, surpassing even the harms of sensual indulgence. While sensual pleasures can be abstained from for a year, eating cannot be forsaken for a single day. Its benefits are great, but its harms are dire. Among the myriad flavors, some clash in their qi and potency; violating their prohibitions breeds toxins. In mild cases, toxins accumulate and fester; in severe cases, they strike violently and suddenly. As for drinking wine and eating dates, they cause stupor and confusion—this is well attested.

Wang Xi of Gaoping, styled Shushi, said: Do not mix foods, for mixtures may conflict, and though no immediate harm appears, over time they cause illness. Furthermore, from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, avoid rich, greasy pastries and similar foods, for they clash with wine, water, and fruits. Though illness may not manifest immediately, when autumn arrives and yang wanes while yin grows, cold qi converges, often bringing sudden, violent diseases. This arises from excessive cold exposure in summer and dietary immoderation. Yet the deluded attribute illness to the day it appears, unaware that its roots have grown gradually.

The Workings of Qi

The primordial qi of the Undifferentiated Origin arises from Non-Being into Being. This Being is called the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. Once the Two Modes are distinguished, the Four Images become manifest. Through the transformations of yin and yang, the myriad things are born. Thereafter, forms and substances take shape, yet the wise and the foolish differ; the boundaries of living beings—long or short—are set, for they receive the harmonious origin in varying degrees of purity and turbidity, deficiency and excess.

Most people fail to align with the seasons and harmonize their qi, to govern their storehouses and settle their spirits. They resign themselves to aging and decline, yielding to decay and dissolution, willingly accepting the limits of their lifespan—how truly lamentable!

The qi within the body is like water within a river. Water can capsize a boat, yet it can also bear it aloft; qi can give life to the body, yet it can also destroy it. Deep and abundant water can carry an extraordinary vessel; accumulated and profound qi can sustain an extraordinary life. When water gathers in depth, it becomes a wellspring; when qi accumulates in depth, it reaches the Field of Essence. The Field of Essence is the numinous clarity. When spirit abides, the body stands; when spirit departs, the body perishes. Thus, one must accumulate and circulate qi, preserve and nurture spirit—this is the Way of long life.

The *Scripture of Western Ascent* of Laozi says: When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the heart is without, harmonious qi returns. Therefore, those who skillfully nurture life conceal the body within the body without revealing it, and hide the person within the person without being seen. Thus, the noble one’s governance must first die for the state. Having died yet not perished, the state flourishes. The people dare not scatter, and once more they are filled. If one can know constancy, actions return to their source. The multitude rejoices, and life begets life. But to act and lose it is to exhaust one’s lifespan.

The great things of the world are vast and ceaseless, obscure and unfathomable—unknowable in their primordial chaos. Those who know it depart from it; those who desire it are separated from it; those who draw near to it are distanced from it. Therefore, the sage does not rely on the world, nor on ghosts and spirits, nor on the myriad things. He constantly takes emptiness as his body and non-being as his heart. These two are called the body of no-body and the heart of no-heart—this may be called guarding the spirit. Guarding the spirit with profound penetration is called unity with the Dao.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of Mysterious Manifestation* says: Heaven and earth bestow transformations, inexhaustible with things; the human way bestows transformations, yet form and spirit decay and perish. To transform through spirit is to exhaust essence and thus decline. Form is born of essence, and essence is born of spirit. Not expending essence, one can unite virtue with Heaven; not transforming through spirit, one can share the realm of the Dao.

It also says: The Dao is the governor of qi; qi is the filling of the body. Those who skillfully fill it fulfill their aspirations; those who fill it poorly lose their form. Thus, the method of circulating qi involves eating little and moderating oneself, moving the body and harmonizing the qi. Following its lightness to ascend, one must not lose it; suddenly returning, one restores it—its appearance is like smoke. Aligning body and form, focusing the heart-mind, firmly guarding within and without, at ease above and below, spirit pervades the bodily frame, cleansing and flowing abundantly in all directions. Cultivating and guarding the Pass of Origin, filling and solidifying it, then extending this, all perverse influences depart naturally.

The *Laozi* says: Ingest qi and swallow essence, receive the luminous mystery; the essential subtleties of the life-generating Way emerge from darkness into obscurity. Above, secure the Cloud Gate; below, fortify the Numinous Root. Like clouds without feet, like water without roots, primordial qi is chaotic, transforming into the Great Clarity. Examine and grasp it, and over time, it becomes numinous. Knowing it is easy; practicing it is difficult.

For those who cultivate life, virtue is the chariot of form, the Dao is the horse of qi, the hun-soul is rooted in essence, and the po-soul is the gateway of the eyes. When form moves, virtue scatters; when qi strays, the Dao rebels; when essence dissipates, the hun-soul is harmed; when the eyes stir, the po-soul is disordered. Therefore, the sage stills the form and closes the qi, hoards essence and cherishes vision, empties and congeals virtue and Dao, solidifies hun and po, guards form and unifies spirit—thus the myriad Ways are accomplished. Approaching the Dao and transforming, one faces danger without fear. If you can cultivate this, you grasp the great essentials of the Dao.

Life does not come again; thus, the Dao is guided by qi. Preserving qi and attaining the Dao leads to long life. Spirit is essence. Treasuring essence brings numinous clarity; numinous clarity brings long life. When qi flows, it becomes the Dao; when essence is preserved, it becomes treasure.

Circulating qi is also called refining qi or prolonged breathing. The method: lie flat and straight, clench the fists, rinse the mouth, and swallow three times. In circulating qi, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Gently contract the nose to draw it in, but do not fill to the utmost—if filled to the utmost, it is difficult to return. When first practicing qi, after five breaths, one may exhale. Each time you wish to stop exhaling, turn and exhale once more, then inhale again through the nose—otherwise, it may cause coughing or counterflow.

Before circulating qi, first settle the body and harmonize the qi; do not contend with the breath. If not harmonized, stop; only proceed when harmonized. Guard it without weariness, and when qi arrives, the body will be at peace. When nasal breathing is harmonious, qi comes and arrives; when the body feels warm, sweat emerges—do not rise, but rest and nurture, striving for duration. With prolonged practice, the Three Worms depart naturally, and awareness becomes distinct.

At night when the magpie cries, recite the incantation:
*Eastern Blue Sprout, consume the Blue Sprout, drink the Morning Flower—three swallows, stop.*
*Southern Vermilion Cinnabar, consume the Vermilion Cinnabar, drink from the Cinnabar Pool—three swallows, stop.*
*Central Wu and Ji, lofty and towering, consume the essence qi, drink from the Sweet Spring—three swallows, stop.*
*Western Bright Stone, consume the Bright Stone, drink the Numinous Fluid—three swallows, stop.*
*Northern Dark Nourishment, consume the Dark Nourishment, drink the Jade Syrup—three swallows, stop.*

After thirty days of this, the worms all die. True spirit and true qi naturally settle; the corpse-possessing demon no longer returns to the heart, and you become an immortal.

The *Jade Calendar Scripture of Laozi* says: The art of nurturing life severs worldly affairs, returning to purity and stillness to cultivate primordial qi.

Harmonize essence and store spirit to return and regenerate life;
Examine desires and cultivate the Dao while guarding the natural.
Beware lest guiding and pulling exhaust your form,
Or grain avoidance and fasting starve your essence.
The six jia and yin-yang must not be disturbed or overturned—
If the heart raves and the mind scatters, spirit departs from form,
And withered bones stand alone, returning to the Yellow Springs.
In stillness, within a dim chamber, nurture your spirit;
When essence ripens and reflection deepens, the Dao becomes natural.

The "Three Ones" chapter is the ancestor of primordial qi,
Drawing from the harmony of the natural—
Its essential point lies in embracing the One without departure.

*The Inner Transmission of Emperor Wu of Han* records:
The Queen Mother of the West said to the Emperor:
"The *Supreme Perfected Scripture* speaks of practicing the Dao of increasing and transforming.
Increasing means augmenting essence; transforming means altering form.
One who can increase and transform is enrolled in the register of superior immortals;
One who neither increases nor transforms does not escape death and calamity.
To practice increasing and transforming is to constantly contemplate the numinous treasure.
Numinous means spirit; treasure means essence.
You need only cherish essence, grasp it firmly,
Close the breath and swallow saliva—
Qi transforms into blood, blood into bone.
Practice this without weariness, and spirit and essence will overflow.
After one year, the qi is transformed;
After two years, the blood is transformed;
After three years, the vessels are transformed;
After four years, the sinews are transformed;
After five years, the bones are transformed;
After six years, the skin is transformed;
After seven years, the countenance is transformed;
After eight years, the hair is transformed;
After nine years, the form is transformed.
When the form is transformed, change occurs;
With change, the Dao is accomplished;
With the Dao accomplished, one attains the rank of immortal.
Exhaling and inhaling the six qi, the mouth becomes sweetly fragrant;
Eating numinous mushrooms, one savors their taste—
Then naturally one ascends lightly.
Even ordinary people who practice this attain longevity."

Master of the Mountains, Liao Xiang, in his *Method of Qi Absorption*, states:
"Those who learn to absorb qi should first abstain from food for two hours,
Burn incense to the left and right,
And after fourteen days, reduce one meal.
After each meal, sit quietly for a long while, close the breath,
Calm the mind, and concentrate the spirit.
If one does not focus the heart and apply intent,
Absorbing qi in vain will yield no benefit.
When closing the breath, external qi does not enter, and internal qi does not exit—
Within this, adjust the breath at will without causing distress.
If slight discomfort or heat is felt, exhale gently through the mouth.
With days and months of practice, qi will flow like clouds.
Once qi flows, it naturally endures;
From then on, one may cease grains.
The method of absorbing qi is passed down through oral instructions of the moment.
Close the breath, calm the mind,
Then fill the mouth with qi and swallow it to satiety.
If not yet sufficient, after another night, true qi will circulate, and hunger and thirst vanish.
If one relies solely on scriptures and formulas, doubts and errors will surely arise.
First, one must enter the gate of concentrated reflection;
Otherwise, even if qi is obtained, it will be turbid and impure.
If qi and heart are both refined,
Once true qi is attained, it is never lost.
Even if one holds office or manages affairs, there is no hindrance—
The spirit remains undisturbed, and one’s faith in clarity and emptiness deepens.
If the four limbs feel weak, eat a fine meal to replenish,
Then resume fasting the next day, continuing as before.
Always be mindful to avoid salty, sour foods, and garlic;
Other bland flavors may be eaten, but not in excess.
Do not drink to extreme intoxication.
Equal parts stalactite and mica,
With sesame, rehmannia, wolfberry, ophiopogon, poria, and polygonatum—
Steeped in ghee, honey, jujubes, and chestnuts—
All may assist the qi.
Even if not all are available, consuming one medicinal ingredient regularly will prevent deficiency.
When true qi enters the mouth, hunger is no longer felt.
Beginners who have not grasped the essentials,
Mistaking temporary satiety for success,
May abruptly cease grains and abandon wheat and hemp—
Unaware that they swiftly invite wind and depletion,
Achieving nothing and instead attracting illnesses.
After eating to fullness, wait a while, then close the breath;
When hungry, absorb qi.
Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, practice without hindrance.
One must always have medicine in the abdomen,
And occasionally drink a little medicinal wine to assist the qi.
As the saying goes: 'Before the years and months are fulfilled, the flesh remains lean.'
If one diligently applies effort,
After four or five years, grain essence is exhausted,
Qi and essence gradually congeal,
And over time, true qi naturally forms.
If one wishes to remain among people,
Once the qi is cultivated and the Dao accomplished,
The complexion does not age, and aspirations expand—
One who has karmic ties with the world may dwell long among mortals,
Unscathed by worldly things.
Eating when food is encountered is no hindrance;
Not eating brings even greater clarity and emptiness.
If one seeks swift ascension as an immortal,
One must retire to a famous mountain to cultivate the Dao,
Cutting off all worldly attachments.
Within ten years, one will ascend lightly in broad daylight—
On the day of ascension, let contemporaries witness it,
Free from the suspicion of secretive conduct—
Then one may be called a true immortal.

The golden nectar and jade fluid are the saliva in the mouth,
Called the Flowery Pool.
Rinsing and swallowing it is not sought but naturally arises—
It is also called the natural golden liquid and jade spring.
As the saying goes:
Refine qi to become true,
Awareness can communicate with the divine.
Embryonic breathing and guarding the One
Complete the union with heaven.
Returning elixir and embryonic breathing
Extend years without limit.
Grain qi fills the abdomen, yet the belly is empty;
Embryonic qi is empty, yet the belly is full.
For those newly absorbing qi,
Do not speak in a loud voice, lest you harm harmonious qi.
After three years, if essence and qi are not squandered,
Movement is unobstructed.
If yang energy stirs and desire arises,
Do not approach the bedchamber.
First, sit upright, close the eyes, and hold the breath,
Rejecting all worldly things.
In a moment, essence and qi will flow and spread,
Pervading the bones, marrow, blood vessels, and even the hair.
This is the accomplishment of the sages and perfected ones through endurance—
Only they can practice this method.
Yet the arts of the bedchamber are essential for Dao cultivators to know.
Since the body’s leaks must rely on yin-yang matters,
How can one remain ignorant?
If lustful thoughts arise or essence is lost in dreams,
Practicing this method in a timely manner can replenish the brain,
Enabling control over dream demons, heat stagnation, and all leakages."

Thus the *Nanhua Pian* states, "The sage treasures essence"—this is its meaning. Moreover, before the waxing and waning of the moon stir outwardly, close the breath to allow qi to flow unimpeded, like rivers and streams that never briefly stagnate, for stagnation breeds illness. Always direct the mind to seal essence and qi, and after refining them, swallow the breath and fluids three to five times to replenish, continuing thus until the day of ascending as an immortal, when the practice of qi will be mastered. Therefore, *Laozi* says: "The superior person, hearing the Dao, diligently practices it." This is what it means.

After a hundred days of practicing qi, if the intestines still contain waste, one should consume broth and noodles—half a bowl if insufficient, adding more, but never to full satiation. Avoid the privy; first clench both fists and press them against the abdomen on all sides, then hold the breath for a long while, and the old waste will descend naturally. Daily, consume medicinal foods and black sesame, regularly applying the previous method to eliminate accumulations in the intestines. Frequently hold a jujube pit in the mouth, drawing its fluids and swallowing repeatedly, so that saliva will never be squandered. As the saying goes, "Tears and saliva are the highest essence"; if the upper essence is not lost, the lower essence will not leak, and longevity is naturally attained.

Yet when beholding all forms and appearances, one must constantly restrain body and mind, preventing desire from arising. If one senses its stirrings, direct the mind to calm the spirit and settle the will. If one can practice mental stability throughout, so that forms do not provoke desire, this is called attaining the Dao. When contemplating qi, if the qi is pure and the mind is serene, one may ascend as a flying immortal without seeking it, and the Dao will naturally be achieved without pursuit. Those who seek proof should follow this principle—do not practice in vain!

For those who absorb qi while lying down, take gentle breaths through the thighs, moving the toes and hooking them downward, now tense, now relaxed, then relaxing the limbs. Concentrate the spirit and quiet the thoughts, proceeding as before to guide the qi. Though it is called guiding qi, one need not force the mind; when the mind is still and qi harmonized, the principle is naturally wondrous. As qi circulates, the body’s condition becomes apparent. If there is acute illness or injury from poisons, gently contract the abdomen, clench the fists, hold the breath, and direct long breaths with the mind to attack the afflicted area. After a long while, the ailment will be cured and no longer pose a threat.

Every morning before rising, while still in bed, warm the hands by rubbing them together, then press them to the face to stimulate the eyes’ spiritual light. Pull the ears and the temples, from the hairline before and behind to the crown of the head, always tugging with the hands to promote the flow of blood and qi, which can prevent white hair.

If one refines the breath to extend it, it becomes "inner breathing." For inner breathing, qi does not pass through the Mysterious Female—one must never inhale through the mouth. If the breath enters and exits smoothly through the nose, it is proper. Inhaling through the mouth is called "counterflow qi," which greatly harms the body; be vigilant never to let qi enter through the mouth.

If the limbs feel sluggish or the five viscera are unbalanced, after refining the breath, one must perform *daoyin* and self-massage, exhaling with *xu* and *he*. Once finished, drink a little medicinal wine to dispel wind, then sit quietly for a long while, freeing the mind to follow its inclination.

Those who study the Dao and practice qi absorption, if they have not yet attained mastery, must not recklessly transmit these methods to others, for both teacher and student will be harmed, bringing misfortune even to departed ancestors. Thus, one may first forfeit one’s own lifespan, and the corpse will then seek longevity in vain!

Every morning, first knock the teeth together and exhale the old to inhale the new fourteen times, then begin holding the breath to absorb qi.

The method for practicing qi at dawn and dusk states: Perform this daily at dawn, for dawn and dusk are the times of yin-yang transition. At dawn, during the first watch of the fifth night watch, warm qi arrives, called "yang’s growth and yin’s decline." At dusk, after the sun sets, cool qi constantly emerges from heaven and earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, seas, humans, the six livestock, grasses and trees, and all the myriad things, ceaselessly alternating in exchange. This ebb and flow resembles the succession of day and night, the tides of the sea, and the Dao of heaven and earth’s waxing and waning.

Rest both hands on the knees, slowly pressing the joints, exhaling turbid qi through the mouth and inhaling pure qi through the nose. Exhalation expels old qi, also called "dead qi"; inhalation draws in new qi, also called "living qi." Thus the *Laozi Jing* says: "The gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth. It endures ceaselessly, yet its use is inexhaustible." This refers to the mouth as the gate of heaven and earth, through which the affairs of yin-yang and life and death are exchanged.

After a long while, slowly push upward, downward, forward, and backward with the hands. Open the eyes wide, part the lips, knock the teeth, rub the eyes, press the head, pull the ears, tug the hair, twist the waist, cough, and shake the body vigorously. Perform these movements singly or in pairs, using the hands in reverse. Then stretch the hands and feet upward, counting to ninety before stopping. Then press downward, slowly calming the mind and focusing inwardly. Visualize the Great Harmony’s primordial qi descending from the void into the hair, gradually entering the crown like rain and dark clouds moving into mountains and rivers, penetrating the skin and flesh, reaching the bones and brain, and slowly descending into the abdomen. The four limbs and five viscera all receive its moisture, like water deeply entering the earth. If the circulation is thorough, one will feel a gurgling sound in the abdomen. Concentrate the mind and maintain focus without distraction. In a moment, the primordial qi will reach the Sea of Qi, then flow to the Bubbling Spring. If the circulation is thorough, one will feel the body tremble, the feet curl, and hear a rustling sound in the groin. After one or two cycles, stop. Practicing this three times daily, one will feel the body smooth and moist, the complexion radiant, the skin and hair lustrous, the ears and eyes sharp, the appetite improved, strength enhanced, and all illnesses dispelled. Even at fifty, if one persists without forgetting, after a thousand cycles, the Dao of immortality will not be far.

For the method of regulating qi to treat illness: Regulating qi can cure even the gravest ailments. After a hundred days of regulating qi, the hair and temples will regrow, and other illnesses need not be mentioned. The method of regulating qi states: From midnight to noon is called "living qi," during which one may regulate and absorb it.

After noon until before midnight is called "dead qi," which must not be regulated or absorbed.

When regulating qi, lie supine on a thick, soft mat, with the pillow adjusted so that the head and body are level. Stretch the hands and feet, clench both fists, holding them four or five inches from the body, and keep the feet four or five inches apart. Draw qi in through the nose until it reaches the feet, then stop; if one has strength, draw more. If the qi lingers too long and causes discomfort, exhale slowly through the mouth. When finished, inhale slowly through the nose again, exhaling in the same manner as before.

For those suffering from chills and fever or sudden swelling and paralysis, regardless of whether it is before or after noon, regulate the qi one meal’s time before the onset of symptoms. If the condition does not improve by the next day, regulate again.

For heart-cold disorders, exhale with a *hu* (呼) sound; for liver disorders, exhale with a *xu* (嘘) sound; for lung disorders, exhale with a *si* (咽) sound; for kidney disorders, exhale with a *chui* (吹) sound; for spleen disorders, exhale with a *xi* (嘻) sound.

At the crowing of the rooster: seventy-two breaths; at dawn: sixty-three; at sunrise: fifty-four; at breakfast time: forty-five; at the *si* hour: thirty-six.

Master Tao’s *Grasping the Center Formula* for absorbing the Three Qi: Perform this once daily. Face the sun, close the eyes, and visualize green qi, white qi, and red qi, each like a beam descending from the sun into the mouth. Hold them for ninety cycles, stopping once satiated. Each inhalation and swallow should clearly guide the Three Qi into the viscera, allowing them to flow and permeate fully. Once the count is complete, rest.

It is said: This is the method of the *Inner Radiance of the Great Primal* taught by the High Perfected Yuan to Tong Chufu and Fan Jian in their youth—a practice rare yet easily verified.

Zheng Yuanming’s method of absorbing qi: Qi is the art of longevity. The concern is not that it is without benefit, but that one may fail to practice it. For those bound by worldly conventions, it may seem difficult at first. Yet if one persists, the lifespan of Peng Zu may be attained.

Thus do birds and beasts, burrowing and hibernating without eating, preserve themselves—all by means of this Dao. If one wishes to practice it intentionally, one must first await the moment when the mind wanders in stillness, when qi merges with the void, when selfishness is diminished and desires are few, when cunning is abandoned and the body is forgotten. Before the six senses are even engaged in preserving form, how can the myriad things disturb one’s thoughts? Only when the will is firmly fixed in its place and practice follows may one perform the bear’s stretch and the crow’s extension, the tortoise’s breath and the crane’s transformation—then the company of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao will seem as nothing.

Here follows the method in sequence:

The oral instructions state: When first absorbing qi, lie supine with the mouth closed, puff the cheeks to fill the mouth with qi, then swallow. The method of swallowing: focus the mind, contract slightly, and send it downward as if swallowing food. The throat has three passages—saliva enters the kidneys, one path carries qi into the abdomen and stomach, and another conducts qi out from the five viscera. If there is heat above and cold below, first absorb warming qi. Warming qi is drawn in by contracting the mouth. In spring and summer, one should absorb cooling qi.

At first, lie supine to absorb qi; afterward, whether walking, standing, or sitting, when swallowing and puffing the cheeks, the teeth must be slightly parted so the qi descends. If the teeth are clenched, the qi will not descend—this must be carefully observed. For absorbing qi, wait until the food from the previous meal has fully digested at the fifth watch, then practice until mealtime when hunger is forgotten. Forgetting hunger is the sign of progress; once progress is made, absorb qi whenever hunger arises, without fixed times. When strength is felt, resolutely avoid eating. If the body’s qi feels slightly depleted at first, use wine, tea, honey, jujube decoction, or pomegranate juice as desired, in whatever quantity, to assist the qi’s momentum.

In autumn and winter, keep the absorbed qi warm but not excessively hot; in spring and summer, cool drinks are unproblematic. After seven days of absorbing qi—or even five—one may have several bouts of diarrhea; do not be alarmed. There may be foam, or there may not, and after a short while, it may turn reddish—no need for concern. After seven days, the qi gradually becomes unobstructed, and the body’s qi stabilizes. Before seven days, some weakness may persist because the qi has not yet fully circulated. After seven days, when harmony is felt, increase the absorption of qi and no longer need to eat. If yang stirs within the first seven days, this is a sign of qi circulation—do not be alarmed.

When absorbing qi, never allow the abdomen to feel empty. If it becomes discontinuous, strength may weaken. If too much qi is absorbed, it may cause belching, or the urge to belch above and purge below—this is not a serious matter. From the third day onward, strictly avoid eating food or fruit; only water or broth is permissible. If other foods are consumed alongside qi absorption, the qi will not circulate, and no success will follow, for the abdomen will be filled with impurities.

If qi in the abdomen rises as belching or descends as the urge to purge, both must be suppressed and not allowed to escape. If unable to restrain them, replenish the lost qi by counting and adding more, or guide it with the mind to disperse. When first absorbing qi, the mind must be open and free of doubt; do not fear failure or harbor anxiety, for fear disrupts the qi’s flow. One must be joyful and content, free from all envy, improving day by day with boundless delight.

Before qi absorption is mastered, avoid excessive fatigue, which harms the qi. Instead, walk a little from time to time to harmonize the qi and pulse. Mastery of this Dao depends entirely on sincerity—nothing is unattainable. Those who absorb qi must first ensure their minds are free of entanglements, their hearts in accord with the Dao. Then all illnesses will be cured. If the four limbs feel unwell, direct qi to the afflicted area to attack the ailment, and it will naturally be dispelled. Once mastery is achieved, illness will never arise; the body will be light and strong, able to run alongside a galloping horse. Strength will be abundant, no different from when eating, and one may walk two or three hundred *li* in a day.

Some say that absorbing qi after encountering filth is harmful—this is mistaken. It is best to maintain purity and avoid foulness, but the key is inner emptiness and self-discipline.

The *Ten-Day Oral Instructions on Absorbing Qi* states:
The Dao of a single day: be full in the morning, hungry at dusk. This refers to those who cannot yet cease eating entirely, so they eat their fill in the morning and hunger by evening.
The Dao of a month: do not lose the waxing and waning. This refers to regulating the waxing and waning of essence in the bedroom. If one preserves breath and essence, the bones and marrow will be full; fullness leads to flourishing, and flourishing leads to longevity. Indulgence depletes essence; depletion leads to withered bones, and withered bones lead to decline and death.
The Dao of a year: thin in summer, plump in winter. This refers to the seasonal rhythms of harmonious qi, likened to fetal breathing that fills the abdomen, as if an infant in the womb—no exhalation, no inhalation, naturally plump and joyful.
The Dao of a hundred years: regulate grain and eat jujubes. This speaks of those who cannot yet cease eating entirely, so they consume medicinal foods. Jujubes replenish qi, hence their consumption.
The Dao of a thousand years: a solitary man without women. This means preserving essence and cutting off lustful desires to eternally safeguard the Dao of longevity—this is the solitary man.

The method of absorbing qi: perform 360 swallows, accumulating the count to ten for best results—then hunger will vanish. After midnight, perform nine sets of nine; at the cawing of the magpie, eight sets of eight; at sunrise, six sets of six; at mealtime, five sets of five; at mid-morning, four sets of four; at dawn, seven sets of seven (this is the third in sequence). These six absorptions correspond to the twenty-four qi of the seasons, encompassing the qi of spring, autumn, winter, and summer.

The method of absorbing qi: Lie supine with the body straight, hair unbound, feet one *chi* and five *cun* apart, arms five *cun* from the body. Close the eyes, shut the mouth, slowly inhale through the nose, tap the teeth, curl the tongue, swish the sweet spring, and swallow. After two or three swallows, pause briefly, then perform nine swallows to complete the set. Finally, close the eyes and recite the incantation:
*"Drink the sweet spring’s liquid,
Banish a hundred illnesses.
Nourish the five spirits,
Preserve the hun and po.
Never leave this body,
Ever dwell in the mysterious abode."*

Prolonging life and preserving vision, one’s longevity rivals metal and stone. Attaining the rank of True Unity, the Great One is granted celestial registry, and one’s name is inscribed among the Heavenly Lords, resplendent and clear.

**Supplement and Guide**
Those who study the Dao must dwell in tranquility and minimize affairs. Without understanding supplement and guide, how can one sustain life? Thus, the Six Classics delight the spirit yet enslave the nature of man; chess and skillful games may amuse nobles and lords, but they exhaust their vitality. Here, I compile the twelve authentic methods of Peng the Elder to dispel all illnesses, awaiting those who seek the ford of the Way.

**Laozi’s Massage Method**
Clasp the hands together, interlocking them, and press against the thighs—left and right alike.
Draw the hands as if drawing a five-*dan* bow—left and right alike.
Make fists and thrust forward into the void three to five times.
Push with the hands as if moving a stone—left and right alike.
Sit upright, lean the body diagonally, and sing as if pushing a mountain—left and right alike.
Place both hands on the ground, retract the body, arch the spine, and lift upward three times; then strike the back with the hands—left and right alike.
Sit upright, extend the legs three times, and pull back with the opposite hand, reaching behind—left and right alike.
Stand, bend forward and backward three times, then rise and tread forward and backward with the feet—left and right alike.
Sit upright, extend the legs, and hook the extended leg with the opposite hand, placing it on the knee and pressing down—left and right alike.
Press the thighs with both hands—left and right alike.
Twist the body twenty times, pressing the thighs with both hands—left and right alike.
Pull the flanks twenty times.
Clasp the head with both hands and pull the waist left and right twenty times.
Toss the head left and right twenty times.
Grasp the head with one hand and press the knee with the other, bending three times—left and right alike.
Push the head with both feet, lifting three times.
Press the knee with one hand and the head with the other, moving from bottom to top three times—left and right alike.
Raise both hands to the head and lower them three times with force.
Cross the hands and place them on the heart, passing three times; bend the wrists to strike the ribs and pull the elbows—left and right, three times each.
Place the hands on the knees, pull the elbows, then cover the knees with the hands and pull the elbows—left and right, three times each.
Stretch the hands to pull the neck three times; twist the body left and right, forward and backward three times each.
Stroke the shoulders from top to bottom, three times—left and right alike.
Shake the hands outward three times, then inward three times.
Clasp the hands and twist them back and forth, seven times each.
Cross the hands above the head and stretch the flanks ten times—left and right alike.
Clench the fists and place them on the back, bending the spine up and down three times.
To "bend" means to point.
The *Finger Techniques* states: "When guiding and pulling, qi flows freely; when qi flows freely, the spirit is unimpeded. The inner manifests outwardly, thus there is no fixed response."
After practicing these methods for a month, all illnesses will vanish. After a hundred days, the hair at the temples will regrow.
Perform these in a quiet chamber, burning incense without distraction.

**Six Methods with Annotations**
1. Clasp the hands and twist them as if washing—
   *Annotation:* The left hand represents Heaven, the right hand Earth. When Heaven and Earth harmonize, the drum of life stirs, the Six Palaces open, and the hundred spirits return.
2. Lightly cross the hands, turn them outward, and cover the chest three times—
   *Annotation:* When Heaven and Earth intermingle in harmony, the ten thousand images are born. Reversing the path, the inner shapes the outer, so the spirit unites, flows freely, and aligns with virtue without hindrance.
3. Overlap the hands and press them on the thighs, slowly twisting the body—left and right alike—
   *Annotation:* All things originate from Heaven; man originates from qi. When yin and yang harmonize, circulation flows. Thus, covering the hands over the chest and slowly twisting the body embodies the principle of returning to the root.
4. Withdraw the fists to open the chest—left and right alike—
   *Annotation:* The sun and moon roll and unfold, following the seasons to still the mind and become the spirit’s abode. Opening them allows the spirit to flow freely.
5. Clasp the head with both hands and turn the thighs—left and right alike—
   *Annotation:* This connects the Upper Yellow Court with the Lower Cinnabar Field.
6. Press the hands to the ground, turn the head, and gaze backward like a tiger—left and right alike—
   *Annotation:* Pushing the earth’s gate and training the eyes like a tiger’s gaze generates spirit, unblocks the meridians, and circulates primordial qi.
7. Clasp the hands tightly and tread on them with the feet—left and right alike—
   *Annotation:* Treading on the hands embodies the principle of harmony. When harmony flows, the spirit of the bones and joints flourishes.
Thus, man models Heaven to complete form, and qi unites with the Dao to embody the whole. Heaven possesses six qi to create and nourish the ten thousand things; man possesses six palaces to sustain the body. Movement and stillness must be balanced, and exertion must not exceed limits. As the Way of Heaven turns left, the sun and moon revolve right, stirred by wind and thunder, connected by mountains and marshes. If regulation and release fail, stagnation breeds illness; external pathogenic qi invades, and internal disorders accumulate, leading to premature death and the loss of purity and tranquility.
Therefore, the noble person embodies the center and penetrates principle, adapting to the seasons. At rest, they dwell in leisure to preserve spirit; in action, they practice subtlety to circulate qi. By reversing to fathom Heaven’s principles and nurturing the lower origin through embryonic breathing, the body remains free of illness, and the form and spirit are at peace. When Daoist cultivation is proper, wondrous responses arise, allowing one to soar freely and align with the Great Void from beginning to end.

**Merit and Transgression**
Merit and transgression refer to saving lives and delivering the dying, bestowing kindness upon others.
The *Records of Arrayed Chronicles* states: Those who study the Dao must widely practice hidden virtue, cherishing all beings, rescuing people from peril, delivering them from calamity, valuing the Dao over wealth, bestowing kindness and spreading virtue, sparing no treasures, and offering them to those in need. They should kneel and sincerely invoke the true sages.
The *Sutra of Fundamental Vows* states: Those who seek the Dao of ascending as immortals must establish thirty meritorious deeds. Thus it is said: "When merit reaches three thousand, one ascends to immortality in broad daylight."

The *Scripture of Cavernous Divinity* states: Those who possess ten good deeds will surely bear blessed offspring. Twenty good deeds, and divine spirits will guard them. Thirty good deeds, and they will ward off malevolent ghosts. Forty good deeds, and people will not die unjustly. Fifty good deeds, and their person will be free of guilt. Sixty good deeds, and the Lords of the Dao will abide with them. Seventy good deeds, and they will be linked with the Five Peaks. Eighty good deeds, and their names will be removed from Mount Tai. Ninety good deeds, and they will surely become divine immortals. A hundred good deeds, and they will ascend to the Nine Heavens.

Master Tiaoran says: This may be called one who, from youth to old age, accumulates deeds and amasses merit without the slightest fault or transgression—a person of pure whiteness. Yet if one extends this to three thousand good deeds, it is not even a single upright hair in comparison.

The Perfected of the Great Void says: Feeding a hundred ordinary people is not as good as feeding one good person; feeding a thousand good people is not as good as feeding one who studies the Dao.

*Laozi* says: The Dao encompasses all hundred practices. Thus, even one who has accomplished nine hundred and ninety-nine good deeds, if they are not complete and are moved by profit, will have their merits diminished and their previous achievements lost. Only by governing the body, focusing the mind, and upholding the precepts without fail can one transcend the world.

The *Supreme Regulations* states: Three transgressions may be counted as one diligent act. Diligence refers to the heart constantly aiding others with tireless zeal. Converting three households counts as one merit. Merit refers to three households—where the entire family reveres and believes in the Dao, upholding proper order among elders and youth, and practicing filial piety and kindness. Aiding three wayfarers, orphans, or widows in distress counts as one diligent act. Lovingly yielding wealth, harboring no anger, and avoiding contention—when these are fulfilled three times, they count as one diligent act. All such matters should be sought according to their kind.

The Primordial Lord says: Among all beings that possess qi, none are without desire. Though desires are innumerable, they broadly fall into six categories: first, the five colors; second, the five sounds; third, the five flavors; fourth, the five fragrances; fifth, the five soft textures; sixth, the five attainments. Attainment means being able to discern clearly and without obstruction. Next, one must forget them to preserve long life. Applying this to govern the body, the body will surely attain perfection; governing the household, the household will be harmonious; governing the village, the village will prosper—extending even to the realm, one’s virtue will be universal. Thus, those who seek life must first practice goodness. When the three karmas are pure, all myriad virtues are complete.

A person with one good deed will have a settled mind and peaceful body. Ten good deeds, and their qi and strength will be robust. Twenty good deeds, and they will be free of all illnesses. Thirty good deeds, and all they seek will be attained. Forty good deeds, and they will enjoy prosperity and joy. Fifty good deeds, and their descendants will flourish. Sixty good deeds, and they will pass through calamities. Seventy good deeds, and heavenly spirits will protect them. Eighty good deeds, and they will gain the benefits of the earth. Ninety good deeds, and they will be honored and renowned. A hundred good deeds, and auspicious treasures will descend. Two hundred good deeds, and their descendants’ names will spread. Three hundred good deeds, and their descendants will be greatly wealthy. Four hundred good deeds, and their descendants will be pure and noble. Five hundred good deeds, and their descendants will enjoy long life. Six hundred good deeds, and their descendants will be noble and filial. Seven hundred good deeds, and their descendants will be wise. Eight hundred good deeds, and their descendants will possess virtue and Dao. Nine hundred good deeds, and their descendants will be worthy and sagely. A thousand good deeds, and their descendants will be divine perfected. Two thousand good deeds, and they will become teachers of the multitude, sagely perfected immortals, and divine marshals. Three thousand good deeds, and they will become national teachers, sagely perfected immortals of the celestial bureaus. Four thousand good deeds, and they will become teachers of the realm, sagely perfected immortals who govern the host. Five thousand good deeds, and they will become teachers of the ghostly and numinous, sagely perfected immortals and chief masters. Six thousand good deeds, and they will become teachers of the divine spirits, sagely perfected immortals and ministers. Seven thousand good deeds, and they will become teachers of all heavens, sagely perfected immortals and ducal lords. Eight thousand good deeds, and they will become teachers of the three thousand realms, sagely perfected immortal emperors. Nine thousand good deeds, and they will become the Primordial Lords of the Five Thearchs. Ten thousand good deeds, and they will become the Supreme Jade Emperor.

The Primordial Lord says: The essence of ten thousand good deeds lies in the three karmas. The three karmas give rise to the ten virtues, which in turn generate myriad names. Those who understand follow their kind; the enlightened will perceive this for themselves.

In all cases, practicing goodness increases one’s lifespan, while practicing evil diminishes it. Rewarding good and punishing evil are each overseen by their respective offices. The principle of karmic retribution is precise to the finest detail. When one realizes they have done good, aligning with the above, they should redouble their efforts and avoid undermining previous merits—thus, they may count the days until attaining immortality.

Therefore, superior scholars who study the true Dao do not weary of transgressions, referring to those who, through personal negligence, violate the regulations and prohibitions. By using past merits to compensate for later transgressions, they may extend their years. If one can reform their transgressions, no goodness is greater.

The *Laws of the Mysterious Capital* states: Within the human body, spirits constantly ascend to the celestial bureaus to report one’s good and evil deeds. When a person accumulates one hundred and twenty transgressions, it becomes one *illness*—an illness causes one to encounter more misfortune and less fortune. One hundred and eighty transgressions become one *drain*—a drain causes livestock to fail to multiply. One hundred and ninety transgressions become one *leak*—a leak invites illnesses. Five hundred and thirty transgressions become one *calamity*—a calamity harms the fetus and injures children. Seven hundred and twenty transgressions become one *blight*—a blight results in having no sons and many daughters. Nine hundred and twenty transgressions become one *disaster*—a disaster brings deafness, muteness, and blindness. One thousand eight hundred and ten transgressions become one *misfortune*—misfortune brings sudden, premature death. One thousand two hundred transgressions become one *ruin*—ruin produces rebellious and disorderly people. One thousand two hundred and sixty transgressions become one *fault*—a fault results in the extinction of descendants and childlessness. One thousand four hundred transgressions become one *foundation*—a foundation causes misfortune to flow through five generations. One thousand six hundred and twenty transgressions become one *demotion*—a demotion severs descendants, leaving no posterity. One thousand eight hundred transgressions become one *affliction*—an affliction reduces one to servitude. One thousand nine hundred and eighty transgressions become one *perversity*—perversity produces madness, insanity, and idiocy. Two thousand one hundred and seventy transgressions become one *violence*—violence causes the household to suffer violent deaths by blades. Two thousand three hundred and forty transgressions become one *cruelty*—cruelty causes the household to produce rebels, with fathers, sons, and brothers attacking one another.

Two thousand five hundred and twenty transgressions become one *layering*—layering causes the household to produce deaths from severe and foul diseases. Two thousand seven hundred transgressions become one *harm*—harm causes the household to produce male shamans and female mediums. Two thousand eight hundred transgressions become one *calamity*—calamity causes the household to produce internal strife, debauchery, and perversion among kin. Two thousand nine hundred and twenty transgressions become one *outburst*—outburst causes the household to produce the maimed and crippled. Three thousand and forty transgressions become one *mutation*—mutation causes the household to produce deaths from litigation and imprisonment, with the family exterminated. Three thousand four hundred and twenty transgressions become one *obstinacy*—obstinacy causes the household to produce urban beggars, with corpses abandoned and bones discarded. Three thousand six hundred transgressions become one *ailment*—ailment ensures that death is certain and predetermined.

The *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection* states: No sin is greater than debauchery, no misfortune greater than greed, no fault greater than stinginess. These three are the chariot of disaster. In small measure, they endanger the self; in great measure, they destroy the household.

There are three forms of wealth and nobility in the world: No nobility is greater than being free of guilt, no joy greater than being free of worry, no wealth greater than contentment. To know contentment is to be content—heaven bestows its blessings upon such a one. He who knows not when to stop brings harm upon himself. To grieve over loss and rejoice over gain—where there is prohibition at the gate, there will surely be the fault of breaking through the barrier. When the body dies and the name perishes, the consequences flow to descendants. Affairs are made great through virtue, not through arrogance toward others.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings; the family that accumulates evil will surely have abundant misfortune.

The Primordial Perfected One states: To value long life is to treasure the singular body. Extending from the self and household to the realm, one fulfills filial piety as a child, loyalty as a subject, benevolence as a superior, and obedience as a subordinate. Harmonizing flavors and sounds, calming the spirit and aligning the will, one unites with the Dao in truth. If one hoards the truth within the self, seeking only personal long life, dwelling in non-action, evading superiors and subordinates, neglecting loyalty and filial piety, forsaking universal salvation, turning away from goodness and deviating from the Dao—this is a loss of virtue. Even if one abandons the joys of self and others, forgets the pleasures of taste and beauty, becoming like withered wood or dead ashes, what value is there in that?

What the Dao values lies in being at ease without encumbrance, harmonious and ever-permeating, enduring through eternal kalpas, and delivering all beings. Only such long life is worthy of esteem. Yet long life is difficult to attain; it arises naturally from the establishment of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness. Without these virtues, one who merely retreats to mountains and forests, taking trees and stones as companions, merely wastes one’s life in vain! Or if past sins remain unresolved and no merit is accrued in the present, one loses the human way—how deeply lamentable!

Through the practice of goodness, joy in life endures; through engagement in evil, suffering in death knows no end. Therefore, the superior person exerts diligent vigor, accumulates goodness, and abandons evil, attaining eternal long life and being called a Perfected One. Though heaven and earth may perish, the Perfected One remains indestructible, transcending the Three Realms and roaming freely within the Three Clarities. Constantly saving beings with goodness, nothing is discarded. Those who emulate this will surely become Perfected Ones.

One evil act brings labor to the heart and vexation to the body; ten evils cause the blood and qi to become deficient and excessive; twenty evils result in constant illness; thirty evils prevent the fulfillment of desires; forty evils bring decline and depletion; fifty evils cut off descendants; sixty evils lead to frequent misfortunes; seventy evils cause demonic entities to harm one; eighty evils bring destruction by water and fire; ninety evils result in poverty and lowly hardship; one hundred evils lead to imprisonment and inauspicious omens; two hundred evils erase one’s name from posterity; three hundred evils reduce descendants to begging on the roads; four hundred evils make descendants into slaves; five hundred evils cause descendants to be maimed or die young; six hundred evils produce unfilial descendants; seven hundred evils result in descendants who are mad or insane; eight hundred evils lead to descendants who are epileptic or foolish; nine hundred evils cause the destruction of the household; one thousand evils produce descendants who are demonic and rebellious; two thousand evils consign one to serve as a soldier or menial; three thousand evils bring the six illnesses and solitary destitution; four thousand evils result in exile due to foul diseases; five thousand evils make one a ghost of the Five Prisons; six thousand evils make one a prisoner of the Twenty-Eight Prisons; seven thousand evils make one a laborer in the earthly prisons of all directions; eight thousand evils cast one into the Hell of Cold Ice; nine thousand evils send one to the Border-Bottom Hell; ten thousand evils plunge one into the *Bili* Hell.

The foundation of ten thousand evils arises specifically from the three karmic actions, each generating the next until a thousand or ten thousand evils accumulate, casting one into the *Bili* Hell, with no hope of reprieve. Endlessly extending in desolation, there is no means of liberation—how lamentable!

When one becomes aware of one’s own evils, one should swiftly reform them, thus drawing near to the Dao. If demonic entities disturb a person, one should immediately purify oneself, repenting and reflecting each evening, blaming and reproaching oneself—this is the way.

Laozi bows in reverence and says: One should be exhorted thus.

Master Pei transmits the method of the Three Primordials and Eight Nodes for repenting transgressions:

On the noon of the *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) day, the True Lord of the Great Ultimate convenes with all immortals at the Palace of the Great Ultimate, where jade tablets are inscribed with the names of transcendents.

On the noon of the *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer) day, the Five Emperors gather with all immortals at the Purple Tenuity Palace, where the Four Perfected Ones deliberate the merits and transgressions of those who seek the Dao.

On the noon of the *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice) day, the Perfected Ones of the Five Marchmounts visit the Yellow Elder at the Cloud-Court Mountain’s Yellow Chamber, where all immortal officials assemble at noon to determine the divine registers and efficacious medicines of the world.

On the noon of the *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox) day, the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme August ascends the Jade Tower of Everlasting Continuity in the Palace of Vast Cold’s Upper Clarity, the Void Abode of the Great Void, where all perfected beings gather at the Terrace of the Grand Tenuity. The Nine Celestial Gates are opened, and the Perfected Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens are approached. The Three Elder Lords of the Supreme, the Perfected Ones of the Northern Culmen, and the deities of the Eight Seas command the immortals and numinous worthies of the Five Marchmounts and renowned mountains—numbering in the millions—to assemble at the Yangliao Palace. Together, they deliberate the karmic fortunes and misfortunes of the world’s myriad people, recording the diligence or negligence of those who study the Dao and seek transcendence, the merits and demerits of their daily deeds, the statutes of reward and punishment for good and evil, and the registers of life and death, all meticulously categorized by their respective domains. Furthermore, the officials of the terrestrial bureaucracy and the overseers of all regions impeach and report the merits and transgressions of local Daoist practitioners, as well as the root causes of life and death for the common people. These are itemized and submitted to the relevant authorities, whose decrees are inscribed in the Imperial Records. Every trifling detail of merit or transgression is listed in the Vermilion Registers of Sincerity, and even the most concealed crimes or the subtlest hidden virtues are traced and scrutinized without exception.

On the noon of the *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) day, all perfected immortals from the various palaces visit the Green Lad of the Eastern Sea to finalize the golden script of the inner characters.

On these days, at noon or midnight, one should proceed to the central courtyard—or, if in a chamber of contention, face north, remove one’s headscarf, and bow twice. Kneeling, one solemnly petitions:

*"To the Supreme August Celestial Worthy of the Northern Culmen, the Great Thearch: I humbly confess the measure of my transgressions since assuming this form, beseeching pardon and absolution. From this day forth, I vow to reform my past and cultivate my future, swearing this with a sincere heart and pledging before Heaven and Earth never to repeat such myriad evils."*

Upon concluding, one states one’s aspiration:

*"May the Supreme August Emperor erase my name from the rolls of transgression and dispatch decrees to the Three Officials, that my name may be inscribed in the jade tablets of the immortals, granting me long life, enduring vision, and communion with all numinous beings."*

Afterward, one kowtows four times, bows twice more, and withdraws, rigorously reproaching oneself while inwardly invoking the deities of the Three Primordials to assist in presenting one’s plea for mercy and absolution.

It is further stated that on the days of the Eight Nodes, all immortals gather in grand assembly, and the celestial decrees summon all perfected beings to attend without exception. On the day preceding each node, the myriad spirits approach the barriers; on the node day itself, the exalted and humble alike pay their respects; and on the day following, merits and transgressions are distinguished. Over three days and three nights, the great affairs are concluded. One must be vigilant in avoiding transgressions and diligent in accumulating merit, that one’s name may ascend to the ranks of the perfected and be recorded in the registers of the Great Ultimate.

It is also said that among the seven nodes, the *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox) day is the most weighty. On this day, repentance ensures the erasure of transgressions, but one must never commit ten further offenses, for Heaven and Earth will not forgive, nor allow further amendment. If one has not yet departed the mortal realm, one may yet fear entanglement in calamity; thus, it is fitting to swear reform on the *Qiufen* day, with solemn and earnest words, and self-discipline thereafter.

The noble one says: Who is without fault? Yet to err and not reform—this is true fault. After the repentance of the Autumn Equinox, when all sages assemble, one must never transgress again.

Here concludes the fifth fascicle of *Supreme Sayings in Collected Scrolls*.
