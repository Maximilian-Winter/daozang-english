**Ghost Valley Master – Scroll One**

**1. Shuaihé (Disrupting and Concealing)**
*Shuai* means to agitate or unsettle.
*Hé* means to conceal or withdraw.

When engaging with others in discourse, one may either **agitate them**, prompting them to reveal their alignment, or **conceal them**, prompting them to reveal their divergence.

**If one examines antiquity**, the Sage, when questioning the cosmos, followed (*ruò*) and considered (*qǐ*) the ancient Dao, teaching accordingly.

The Sage, as the first among all beings, emerged before all things, using **prior knowledge to enlighten the unknowing**, and **prior enlightenment to awaken the unenlightened**. Thus, the Sage is first among all beings.

Observing the **opening and closing of Yin and Yang**, the Sage named and commanded all things.
Yang opens to generate life; Yin closes to complete it.
Once generation and completion are established, names must be assigned to them.

Knowing the **gates of existence and annihilation**—
Do not forget that those who perish are those who exist, and those who exist are those who perish.
Only those who perceive the **omens of fortune and misfortune beforehand** truly grasp the *machine* (critical junctures).

Thus it is said: **"Know the gates of existence and annihilation."**

Calculating the **termination and origin of all things**, penetrating the logic of human hearts, and perceiving the **portents of transformation**—
The termination and origin of all things, the logic of human hearts, and the portents of transformation are all clearly manifest. Through profound insight, nothing remains obscure or unmeasured. Thus, one can calculate, penetrate, and perceive.

*Zhèn* (portents) means **sudden emergence**.

And one **guards and oversees these gates**—
*Shǐ* means to **maintain and govern**.
The gates refer to the **gates of existence and annihilation** mentioned above.

Having penetrated the principles of things, knowing the termination and origin of existence and annihilation, the Sage guards and oversees them, ensuring all turn away from annihilation and toward existence.

Thus, the Sage’s Dao in the world, from ancient times to today, remains **one**.

Though all turn away from annihilation and toward existence, the Dao is one.

**Transformation is boundless**, yet all things return to their proper place.
Though the Dao is one, its practice varies, hence **transformation is boundless**. Yet it remains orderly, hence **all things return to their proper place**.

Sometimes **Yin**, sometimes **Yang**; sometimes **soft**, sometimes **hard**; sometimes **open**, sometimes **closed**; sometimes **relaxed**, sometimes **tense**.
These two aspects—**law and symbol**—differ in form, and their teachings vary accordingly.

Thus, the Sage, though **one in guarding and overseeing the gates**, must **carefully examine what comes first or last**!
Though governance may differ, in guarding and overseeing the gates, the Sage remains consistent. Therefore, one must carefully examine what should be prioritized and what should follow.

**Measuring ability and assessing skill**, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.
*Quán* refers to **strategic calculation**; *néng* refers to **inherent ability**; *zhàngqiǎo* refers to **artisan craftsmanship**.

The Sage, in employing people, measures their **strategic acumen and abilities**, assesses their **craftsmanship and skill**, and then assigns them accordingly.

Among the **virtuous and unvirtuous, the wise and foolish, the brave and cowardly, the benevolent and righteous**, there are differences. Thus, one may:
- **Agitate** the virtuous to align them,
- **Conceal** the unvirtuous to reveal their divergence,
- **Advance** the wise and brave to honor them,
- **Retreat** the foolish and cowardly to degrade them,
- **Elevate** or **debase** them as needed,
Yet **do nothing** (*wuwei*) and **shepherd them with humility**.

The virtuous and foolish each fulfill their roles; ministers and officials exert their strengths. The only requirement is **humility and non-action** in guiding them.

**Carefully determine presence and absence** to discern their **substance and emptiness**, and **follow their desires** to reveal their **intentions**.
In employing the worthy, one must first **carefully determine their substance and emptiness**, their **honesty and deceit**, then follow their desires to discern their **true intentions**.

**Subtly challenge their words** and turn them back upon themselves to seek the truth, valuing **obtaining their alignment through agitation** to seek their advantage.
When others speak, one must **subtly challenge and invert their words**, agitating them to reveal their true sentiments. Once the truth is obtained, one may **conceal and agitate them further**, prompting them to seek the **advantage of their own words**.

Sometimes **open and reveal**, sometimes **conceal and close**.
Opening and revealing aligns their sentiments; concealing and closing reveals their sincerity.
Opening aligns to **exhaust their sentiments**; concealing diverges to **test their sincerity**.

**What is permissible and what is not**—carefully examine their strategies to **trace their alignment or divergence**.
In all speech, what is permissible and what is not must be **clearly examined**, their strategies scrutinized to **determine their true alignment or divergence**.

**Unity and separation have their principles**; first, follow their intentions.
Though strategies may vary in unity or separation, if one **holds fast to principle**, they may first follow their intentions to **fulfill them**, thereby knowing the **outcome of success or failure**.

If one seeks to **agitate**, **thoroughness is paramount**; if one seeks to **conceal**, **secrecy is paramount**.
The value of **thoroughness and secrecy** lies in their subtlety, aligning with the Dao.

Agitation **probes their sentiments**; concealment **binds their sincerity**.
Probing while **selecting and choosing**, binding while **tying and restraining**.

Emotions may be true or false, hence the need for **selection and discernment**. Sincerity may lack constancy, hence the need for **binding and restraint**.

All this reveals the **weights and measures** of their **calculations**—thus the Sage **deliberates accordingly**. When the **weights and measures** are laid out, the **light and heavy** naturally distinguish themselves, and only then are **standards** established to **regulate their lightness and heaviness**. Once **light and heavy** find their proper place, **strategies and deliberations** are devised to **guide them along**.

Those who do not conform to the **weights and measures** and **standards** are thus considered by the Sage to be **flawed**—their **lightness and heaviness** do not align with the **true measure**, their **length and shortfall** do not fulfill the **proper count**. Such are **worthless**; what use are they?

The Sage therefore **reconsiders and devises new strategies**, seeking their **opposite**. Thus, when **agitating**, one may either **cast forth** or **withdraw and store**; those who conform to the **weights and measures** are cast forth for use, while the unworthy are withdrawn and hidden.

When **concealing**, one may either **retain** or **reject**. The sincere are retained, the insincere are rejected. **Agitation and concealment** are the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.

**Closing the door** is called **Kun (receptive)**, **opening the door** is called **Qian (creative)**—thus, they are the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**.

**Agitation and concealment** shift **yin and yang**, the **opening and closing of the four seasons**, to **transform all things** in their **longitudinal and latitudinal** ways. The **yin field** shifts, the **four seasons** open and close—all this is the **Dao of agitation and concealment**.

**Longitudinal and latitudinal** refer to **decay and renewal**. All things are either **opened to rise** or **concealed to decay**. **Reversal, inversion, and transformation** must arise from this.

Speaking of the **Dao of agitation and concealment**, it may **reverse** to emerge from one place, or **reverse** to return from another, or **reverse** to transform here while its **nature** manifests there—all this stems from **agitation and concealment**. Hence it is said: *"This is how it arises."*

**Agitation and concealment** are the **great transformations of the Dao**, the **variations of speech**—one must **forewarn and examine** their transformations. If there is no **opening and closing**, the **great Dao** would not transform. If there is no **variation in speech**, then **opening and closing** are what **transform the great Dao**. Though **speech and affairs** may be vast, they all **achieve completion through transformation**. Hence, **divination is prepared**.

**Fortune and misfortune depend on this**. The **mouth** is the **gatekeeper of the heart**; the **heart** is the **master of the spirit**. The heart **expresses itself through the mouth**, hence the mouth is the **gatekeeper of the heart**. The spirit **serves the heart**, hence the heart is the **master of the spirit**.

**Desires, intentions, joys, and appetites**, **thoughts, wisdom, and strategies**—all these **pass through the gate** in and out. These **eight aspects** all **traverse the mouth**, hence it is said they **enter and exit through the gate**.

Thus, **controlling agitation and concealment** regulates their **entry and exit**. **Agitation** is **opening, speaking, yang**; **concealment** is **closing, silence, yin**.

If these **eight aspects** lack **opening and closing**, affairs may become **unregulated**, hence **agitation and concealment** are used to **govern their entry and exit**. **Speaking outward** is **yang**; **concealing emotions inward** is **yin**. When **yin and yang** are harmonized, their **beginning and end** are complete.

**Opening and closing** are **regulated**, hence **yin and yang** are harmonized. **Sequence and order** are appropriate, hence their **beginning and end** are complete.

Thus, **longevity, peace, wealth, honor, fame, affection, profit, satisfaction, joy, and desire** are called **yang**—**beginning**. These all **seek life**, hence they are called **beginning, yang**.

**Death, sorrow, poverty, humiliation, loss, harm, punishment, and execution** are called **yin**—**end**. These all **seek death**, hence they are called **yin, end**.

All **speech that follows yang** is called **beginning**, meaning **goodness initiates affairs**. All **speech that follows yin** is called **end**, meaning **evil concludes strategies**.

It is said that **speech** may be **yin** or **yang**; the listener must **know this distinction**. The **Dao of agitation and concealment** is tested through **yin and yang**.

Whether one **probes** or **conceals**, using **yin and yang speech** to test them reveals their **true intentions**. Thus, when speaking to those of **yang disposition**, one **elevates** them; when speaking to those of **yin disposition**, one **lowers** them.

To those of **yin disposition**, speak **lowly** to seek the **small**; to those of **yang disposition**, speak **highly** to seek the **great**. **Yin speech** is **low and small**, hence *"seek the small with lowliness"*; **yang speech** is **elevated**, hence *"seek the great with height."*

From this, **nothing is excluded**, **nothing is barred**, **nothing is impossible**. When **yin and yang** are exhausted, **small and great** are revealed—thus **entry and exit are all permissible**; what is there that cannot be?

One may **speak to individuals**, to **families**, to **nations**, to **the world**. There is **nothing impossible**, hence all that is spoken is **permissible**.

To act **small** is to have **no interior**; to act **great** is to have **no exterior**. Exhausting **yin** leaves **no interior**, exhausting **yang** leaves **no exterior**.

**Gain and loss, departure and arrival, doubling and reversal**—all are governed by **yin and yang**. **Following the Dao** is called **gain**; **harming affairs** is called **loss**; **contradicting principle** is called **departure**; **aligning with intention** is called **arrival**; **departing utterly** is called **doubling**; **departing and returning** is called **reversal**.

All this does not exceed the **nature of yin and yang**, hence it is said: *"All are governed by yin and yang."*

**Yang moves and acts**; **yin stops and conceals**. **Yang moves outward**; **yin follows inward**. **Yang returns to its beginning and end**; **yin reaches its limit and reverses to yang**.

This speaks of **upper and lower** completing each other through **yin and yang generation**. **Yang moves** to **generate virtue**; **yin remains still** to **form substance**. **Seeking yin with yang** is **enveloping with virtue**; **binding yang with yin** is **applying force**.

This means the **noble nourishes the commoner with rank and rewards**, while the **commoner responds with strength and labor**. **Yin and yang seek each other** through **agitation and concealment**. The **upper and lower** can **seek each other** because **opening and closing** give rise to this.

This is the **Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang**, and it speaks of the laws governing humanity. Since one embodies the **Heaven and Earth** and mirrors **yin and yang**, its laws can thus be applied to humanity.

As the **first principle of all affairs**, it is called the **Gate of Round and Square**. Heaven is round, Earth is square—this is the meaning of **upper and lower**. When the principles of **opening and closing** are fully realized, then all things are generated. Thus, it is the **first principle of all affairs**, and the **Dao/Way of upper and lower** emerges from here. Hence, it is called the **Gate of Round and Square**.

**Secondly, the Dao/Way of listening**: If even one aspect of what is spoken does not align, it must be countered with difficulty. When challenged, the speaker must reconsider and respond accordingly.

The **Great Transformation** of antiquity arose together with the **Formless**. The **Great Transformation** refers to the ancient sages transforming all things through the **Great Dao/Way**. The **Formless** is the **Dao/Way**. Since movement originates from the **Dao/Way**, it is said to arise together with the **Formless**.

To **look backward to understand the past**, to **invert to verify the present**; to **look backward to know antiquity**, to **invert to know the present**; to **look backward to know others**, to **invert to know oneself**. This means the **Great Transformation** of the sage examines all things and reflects upon himself. When undertaking affairs, he weighs them with utmost caution, repeatedly verifying and reflecting to **know what is to come** by first observing what has passed; to **know the present** by first examining antiquity; to **know others** by first measuring himself. Thus, he can **execute strategies without omission**, and his actions **always succeed**.

The principles of **movement and stillness, emptiness and substance** do not align with the present—then one seeks them in antiquity. **Movement and stillness** arise from **action and cessation**; **emptiness and substance** arise from **truth and falsity**. When their principles do not align with the present, one seeks them in antiquity.

There are affairs that, when inverted, reveal their **covering**—this is the intent of the sage. When an affair does not align, one inverts to seek its counterpart, and upon reversing, the **covering** is revealed. This is how **what is to come** is understood through seeking antiquity—this is the sage’s intent. **One must not fail to examine this.**

If one does not scrutinize, one will err in **subtlety**—thus, one must not fail to examine.

**Speech is movement**; **silence is stillness**. Following their words, one listens to their **phrasing**. By observing **stillness** in **movement**, what is seen becomes clear. By examining **speech** through **phrasing**, what is gained becomes evident.

When speech does not align, one inverts to seek it—its response will surely emerge. This means that if speech does not conform to principle, one must not immediately reject it. Instead, one counters it, compelling the speaker to seek truth, and the **response in accordance with principle** will naturally appear.

Speech has **symbols**; affairs have **analogies**. When there are **symbols and analogies**, one observes their **sequence**. Since the **response in accordance with principle** has emerged, speech thus has **symbols**, and affairs have **analogies**. Since past affairs had **symbols and analogies**, one must further observe their **sequence**, allowing them to fully manifest.

**Symbols** refer to **legal models**; **analogies** refer to **proportional reasoning**. **Symbols** mirror the affair; **analogies** compare the phrasing.

To **seek the voiced from the formless**—principle lies in **profound subtlety**, hence it is **formless**. Without speech, it would not be made manifest, hence one seeks the **voiced from the formless**. **Voice** is speech; **analogies** refer to **comparative reasoning**. When the **baited words** align with the affair, one obtains the **truth of the person**.

Obtaining **fish** depends on the **bait**; obtaining **words** depends on the **opening statement**. When the **opening statement** is made, the **response** follows; when the **bait** is cast, the **fish** comes—hence, it is called **baiting with words**. When words align with affairs, it is called **aligning with affairs**. **Testing clearly** lies in **unfolding speech**, hence it is called **obtaining the truth of the person**.

This is like **setting snares to capture beasts**—one spreads the nets widely and oversees them. When the **Dao/Way** aligns with the affair, the truth emerges on its own—this is the **net for capturing people**. When the net is set and overseen, the beasts are naturally ensnared. When the **Dao/Way** aligns with the affair, the principle emerges on its own. Once the principle is manifest, the **sage and worthy** distinguish it.

Even if one seeks to conceal themselves, the **Dao/Way** provides no escape—hence, it is called the **net for capturing people**. If one **constantly holds the net** to drive them toward their duties, those who **defy** will inevitably **speak without restraint**, and one must then **adapt the net**.

To **hold the net for capturing people** is to drive them toward their duties. If they **contradict**, they will **speak without restraint**. Thus, one must **change the net** and further **urge them with boldness**.

To **stir with symbols**, to **respond to their intent**, to **see their emotions**, and to **guide them accordingly**—this speaks of **adaptation**. **Respond** means to **align**. It means to further open **legal models** to stir them; once their intent is aligned, their emotions become visible, and one then **guides them** accordingly.

**I reflect upon the past**; **they invert to come forward**. When speech has **symbols and analogies**, one establishes the **foundation** accordingly. When **I reflect upon the past** to seek them, and **they invert to come forward** to fulfill their duties, then **strategies emerge without end**. Thus, when speech has **symbols and analogies**, there is **no need to select words**. Thus, one can **establish the foundation of the state**.

To **layer, repeat, invert, and cover**—then no affair will lose its words. This means that once **symbols and analogies** are established, one then **layers, repeats, inverts, and covers** them—all referring to **repeatedly examining with meticulous care**, allowing no room for error. Thus, one can **fulfill all affairs perfectly**, with no loss of words.

The sage **leads the foolish and the wise**—all affairs remain **without doubt**. The sage **leads the foolish** by concealing them, thereby knowing their sincerity; **leads the wise** by provoking them, thereby exhausting their emotions, and all obtain their truth. Thus, all affairs remain **without doubt**.

The ancient masters of **inverted listening** transformed **ghosts and spirits** to obtain their emotions. This means that those skilled in **inverted listening** enter a state of **forgetting and abandoning perception**, not pondering yet **profoundly observing**, thus able to **transform ghosts and spirits** to obtain their emotions, penetrating the **profound and subtle** while remaining **mysterious**.

The **gathering of ghosts and spirits** is inherently **secretive**; now, it cannot be done—hence, it is called **transformation**. When **transformation** aligns with principle, then the **Dao/Way of guiding** becomes clear. If the **Dao/Way of guiding** is unclear, the **emotions obtained** will be indistinct; if the **emotions obtained** are indistinct, the **foundation established** will be unclear. **Clarity in emotions** depends on **clear guidance**; thus, if guidance is unclear, emotions remain indistinct. **Clarity in the foundation** depends on **clear emotions**; thus, if emotions are indistinct, the foundation is unclear.

When **symbols and analogies** are transformed, there will surely be **inverted speech** to return and listen to.

「When one speaks, **symbols and analogies** are transformed, and **inverted speech** arises to challenge them. One should let them speak first, then return to **stillness** to listen.

To hear their words, one must remain **silent**; to make them reveal themselves, one must **close one’s eyes** and feign indifference. To raise their voice, one must lower one’s own; to take from them, one must offer instead. This is the **Dao/Way of inverted listening**, by which one can **entice and draw forth** their true emotions.

Thus, when one desires to hear their voice, one must **return to stillness** and **silence**; when one desires them to speak openly, one must **close one’s eyes** and **compress one’s gaze**; when one desires them to be lofty, one must appear **humble**; when one desires them to withdraw, one must **give freely**. In this way, their **emotions** can be **drawn out**, and nothing will remain **hidden**.

To **open their emotions**, one must first **transform symbols and analogies** and **stir them** through **guiding speech**. When voices resonate in harmony, **true principle** converges. If one wishes to **open their emotions**, first **present symbols and analogies** to **move them**. Once their emotions are stirred, **guiding speech** must be **nurtured gradually**, allowing them to speak naturally—like cranes calling in the shade, their voices echoing in response.

Thus, **true principle** can be **drawn together**.

Sometimes this arises from one thing, sometimes from another; sometimes by **attending to the superior** (*shàng*), sometimes by **guiding the inferior** (*xià*). The **Dao/Way of inverted listening** is to know whether their words stem from this or that, or whether they are **attended to from above** or **guided from below**. This is how one **discerns truth from falsehood**, knows **harmony from discord**, and **detects their deceit**.

For **truth and falsehood**, **harmony and discord**, and **deceit**, one discerns them through **attending to the superior** (*shàng*). Their **actions, words, and silences** all emerge from **emotions**; their **joy or anger** reveals their **intentions**.

All this depends on **first establishing clarity within oneself**—this is the **method** for **guiding speech**. One must **invert and probe** to observe where their **emotions** are **lodged**, thus **testing their sincerity**.

To **know others**, one must first **see their emotions**; hence, this **Dao/Way of inverted listening** is employed. If one seeks **inner stillness**, one must listen to their words, examine their **affairs**, **discuss all things**, and **distinguish between strength and weakness**.

Though their words may not be of immediate concern, one can **perceive the subtle** and **know the general** (*lèi*). When one **investigates others** and **dwells within their intentions**, one can **measure their capacity** and **shoot their intent**—like a snake’s mark never missing, or **Yì’s arrow** striking true.

If their **words and emotions align**, their **fortune or misfortune** will not stray—like **Yì’s arrow** finding its mark without fail. **Listening to speech** and **observing emotions** is no different; hence, they are compared thus.

Thus, the **beginning of knowing** lies in **self-knowledge** before knowing others. The one who **knows others** is **wise**; the one who **knows oneself** is **enlightened**. **Wisdom** arises from **enlightenment**, and **enlightenment** can **generate wisdom**. To **know others**, one must first **know oneself**.

Their **mutual understanding** is like **eyeless fish** (*bǐmù*)—each depends on the other. Their **manifestation** is like **light and shadow**—one cannot exist without the other. I can **know myself**; they must **rely on my knowing them**—both gain, and only then do the **Dao/Way of the sages** converge, hence like **eyeless fish**.

When **sages** unite, **principle** naturally **shines forth**, like light giving rise to shadow. Their **words are never lost**—like **magnets drawing nails** or **tongues touching the palate**. If one **discerns the sage** with **sagely wisdom**, what more is there to lose? Hence, like **magnets drawing nails** or **tongues touching the palate**.

Their **interaction with others** is **subtle**; their **perception of emotions** is **swift**. The **Dao/Way of sages** in dealing with others is **refined and elusive**; yet in an instant, they **see emotions** with precision—like **yin** and **yáng**, or **yáng** and **yin**, like **roundness** and **squareness**, or **squareness** and **roundness**.

The **Dao/Way of ascending and descending** (*shàngxià*) is to **take their type** as one’s own **arms and legs**—to **compare them as parts of a single body**. This **principle** has been **long-standing**.

Thus, their **mutual fulfillment** is like **yin** and **yáng**. Their **mutual manifestation** is like **roundness** and **squareness**. Before their **form is seen**, one **guides them with the Dao/Way of roundness**; once their **form is manifest**, one **tasks them with the square method**.

Their **advancement or retreat**, **left or right placement**, is governed by this. This is the **Dao/Way of employing others**—whether **promoting them**, **demoting them**, **assigning them to the left**, or **elevating them to the right**—all is determined by the **principle of ascending and descending** (*shàngxià*).

If one does not **first establish clarity within oneself**, then **guiding others** will be **improper**. Their **advancement or retreat**, **left or right placement**, if not **first established**, will not align with the **proper method** of **guiding others**.

If their **employment** is **unskillful**, it is called **forgetting emotions** and **losing the Dao/Way**. When **employment is unskillful**, one **operates from the superficial** (*mò*), **continues without pause** (*xù*), **uses round tools for square holes** (*záo*), and **square tools for round holes** (*bǐng*), thus **losing both emotions and the Dao/Way**.

If one **first establishes clarity** and **guides others** with **perfect virtue**, then one **drives without visible trace** (*míngxiàng*), **no one sees one’s approach** (*mén*), and it is called **heavenly and divine**.

If one can **first establish clarity**, then **guiding others** becomes **virtuous and boundless**—**mysterious winds** (*xuánfēng*) **blow far and wide**, neither **form nor trace** is seen, neither **door nor entrance** (*ménhù*) is apparent. One **sees their form** yet cannot **grasp it**; the **Dao/Way** is **ever-applied** yet **unknown**. Hence, it is called **heavenly and divine**.

**Inner Harmony, the Third Chapter**

**Binding** (*chà*) means **holding fast** so that it remains **secure**. One **secures** only after **obtaining**—then **roundness is joined** without separation.

In matters of **ruler and subject**, **superior and inferior**, if the **Dao/Way aligns**, they **draw near despite distance**; if it does not align, they **stay distant despite closeness**, and **reject what is not their intent**. If their **affairs are in accord**, they **depart yet return** in seeking **harmony**.

They **advance yet do not approach**; they **hear voices from afar** yet **ponder them in return**. When **separated**, they **advance yet do not approach**, and **hear voices** while **pondering in return**.»

「All affairs possess **inner harmony** (*nèijiàn*). Words may **draw near despite distance**, or **stay distant despite closeness**—hence, all affairs possess **inner harmony**. They are **bound** by **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **Dao/Way** (*lǜ*), or by **factional ties and wealth**, or by **beauty and favor**. **Binding** from their very **beginning**.

Some are **bound** by **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way**—when **Dao/Way** connects them to the **ruler and subject**, they are called **subjects** in name, but in reality, they are **masters**. When **Dao/Way** binds them through **friendship**, they are called **friends**—as seen in the case of **Guiguzi**’s disciples in *Ghost Valley Master’s Scrolls* (卷上). Those **bound** by **wealth** or **beauty**, like **Fei Zhong** and **E Lai** under **Jie** and **Jiu**, are of this kind.

They **utilize their own intentions**—if they wish to **enter**, they enter; if they wish to **exit**, they exit; if they wish to **draw near**, they draw near; if they wish to **stay distant**, they stay distant; if they wish to **approach**, they approach; if they wish to **depart**, they depart; if they wish to **seek**, they seek; if they wish to **ponder**, they ponder. The eight matters from **self-entering and self-exiting** downward are all in accordance with the **subject’s** intentions, following their own desires.

Thus, they can **steadfastly resolve their will** toward the **ruler**, and no external force can **intervene**. Like the **ant mother** (*yímǔ*) following its young—when it **exits**, there is no **trace**; when it **enters**, there is no **boundary**; it **goes alone and returns alone**, and none can **halt** it.

The **ant mother** (*yímǔ*), also called **locust mother** (*huánglà*), resembles a spider, dwelling in a **burrow** with a **cover**. It nurtures its young by covering the burrow’s entrance, and when it **exits and enters**, there is **no initial trace**—thus, nothing can **halt** it.

Now, the **subjects** of **inner harmony** (*nèijiàn*) **yield flexibly** to the **ruler**, **binding themselves securely** without **leaving any gaps**. This is also due to **inner harmony**.

The **inner harmony** (*nèi*) lies in **advancing persuasive speech**, while the **binding** (*jiàn*) lies in **securing their plans**. When persuasive speech is **advanced**, they **bind themselves internally** to the **ruler**. Hence, it is said that the **inner harmony** (*nèi*) lies in **advancing persuasive speech**.

They **weigh the situation** to **plan accordingly**—if the **ruler** does not **grasp** or **accept** their plans, they are **discarded**. Thus, it is said that the **binding** (*jiàn*) lies in **securing their plans**.

Those who wish to **persuade** must **conceal their true intentions** and **weigh the situation**; those who **plan** must **follow what is convenient**. If they **persuade** while **concealing their intentions**, their words **will succeed**. If they **plan** while **following convenience**, their plans **will be adopted**. Through **subtle deliberation** of **feasibility** and **open discussion** of **advantages and losses**, they **guide the ruler’s will**.

When **opportunities arise** and **timing is right**, they **align with the ruler’s plans**. *"Opportunity"* refers to the **Dao/Way unfolding**—when the **Dao/Way** **defends** and **advances**, their words **respond to the moment’s needs**, aligning with the **ruler’s** plans.

They **carefully consider** the **ruler’s** **binding** and **respond appropriately** to **timing**—when **planning** and **deliberating**, they **advance** to the **ruler**, securing their own position, and then **respond** to the **ruler’s** needs, ensuring their words **align with the ruler’s heart**.

If there is **internal discord**, it cannot be **implemented**. If their **plans** do not **align with the ruler’s**, they cannot be **executed**. Thus, they **probe the ruler’s current inclinations**, **adapt to what is convenient**, and **seek to change** their plans. When their **initial plans** prove unfit, they **reassess**, **adjust**, and **act according to the moment’s needs** to **alter their strategies**.

To **seek internal harmony** through **change**, they **employ the method of "taking with the tube"** (*guǎnqǔjiàn*). When they **take with the tube**, it **becomes distant**; when they **seek internal harmony** through **change**, it **becomes secure**. It is said that when **advancing**, they must **first use persuasive language**; when **responding**, they must **employ adaptable words**. If **past matters** are already **settled**, their words must **be persuasive**; if **future matters** have not yet **manifested**, their words must **be flexible**.

Those skilled in **change** thoroughly **know the terrain’s** (*dìshì*) **conditions**, thus **grasping the Dao/Way of heaven** (*tiān*). Knowing the **Dao/Way of heaven**, they **harmonize with the four seasons**, causing **ghosts and spirits** to **align with yin and yang**.

Those skilled in **change** refer to those who **master the principles** of **adaptable strategies**. Thoroughly **knowing the terrain’s** (*dìshì*) **conditions**, they can **grasp the Dao/Way of heaven**. Hence, it is said that they **thus grasp the Dao/Way of heaven**. Knowing the **Dao/Way of heaven**, they **follow the natural order** of the **four seasons**. Hence, it is said that they **harmonize with the four seasons**.

**Ghosts and spirits** are those that **assist yin and yang** in **nurturing life**. When the **Dao/Way** **unifies heaven and earth**, they can **cause ghosts and spirits** to **align in virtue** with **yin and yang**.

Thus, they can **nurture the people**. When they **observe the ruler’s** **plans and affairs**, they **know their intentions**.

Their **nurturing of the people** lies in **observing their plans and affairs** to **know their intentions**. If there are **plans that do not align**, it is because they are **unfamiliar**.

When they **align yet do not bind**, it is **yang** (*yang*) **drawing near externally** while **yin** (*yīn*) **stays distant internally**. There may be **separation and reunion** without **secure binding**—when **yang** (*yang*) **externally draws near**, while **yin** (*yīn*) **internally stays distant**.

If there are **plans that do not align**, the **Sage** will not **endeavor** them. *"Not align"* refers to **round holes for square pegs**; hence, the **Sage** will not **endeavor** such plans.

Thus, those who **draw near despite distance** possess **hidden virtue**; those who **stay distant despite closeness** lack **harmony of intent**. *"Hidden virtue"* refers to **private bonds** of **yin** (*yīn*).

Those who **approach yet are rejected** have **unfavorable strategies**; those who **depart yet return seeking** have **opportunities arising mid-affair**. It is said that when **words** do not **align with the moment**, and **affairs** are **settled only after realization**, it is because **opportunities arose mid-affair**.

Those who **advance yet do not approach** have **improper implementation**; those who **hear voices from afar yet ponder them in return** are **aligned with their plans** and **await decisive action**. It is said that when their **actions** **align with their own plans**, they **wait to execute them in sequence**, hence *"hear voices from afar yet ponder them in return"*.

Thus, it is said:
*"If one does not see their kind yet acts accordingly, they will meet with opposition; if one does not grasp their true intent yet persuades them, they will be met with disapproval."*

It is said that if one does not **grasp their true intent and kind**, yet **persuades them**, it is like **driving northward while facing south** or **Chen Xiao** traveling to **Qin**—thus, they will **meet with disapproval and opposition**.

If they **grasp their true intent**, they can **control their movements**—when they **encounter favorable winds**, like **swans** (*hóng*) or **fish** (*yú*) in **vast waters**, they **flow freely**, and none can **halt** them. Thus, they can **direct their actions** at will.

This **method** allows for **free entry and exit**, **secure binding or opening**. This **method** refers to **grasp of their true intent**—then **entry and exit** are **unrestricted**, and **binding or opening** are **as they wish**.

The Sage establishes affairs by first knowing through this grasp of intent and thus controlling all things. It is said that by grasping intent to establish affairs, one can foresee what is favorable or not. All things, whether bound or unchanging, are thus rooted in grasping intent.

From the Way and virtue, to ren and righteousness, to rites and music, to strategies and schemes—all stem from grasping intent, enabling the practice of ren, righteousness, and virtue in all undertakings.

First, one examines the *Shijing* and *Shujing*, blending and adjusting interpretations, deliberating what to retain or discard. *Hun* means "to harmonize." This refers to first considering the words of the *Shijing* and *Shujing*, aligning them with one’s own reasoning, then adjusting and refining current affairs, debating what to accept or reject.

To unite, one employs the inner; to discard, the outer. *Inner* refers to intent within; *outer* refers to intent without. When intent is grasped, unity follows naturally; when intent is lost, separation ensues—this is the constant principle.

To discern inner and outer, one must master the Dao and its patterns, anticipating events through strategy, resolving doubts with precision. It is said that those skilled in inner and outer understanding perceive the unfolding of the Dao’s patterns, foresee events, and resolve doubts in sequence.

With no miscalculations in strategy, one establishes merit and builds virtue. Having mastered the Dao’s unfolding, one’s strategies are without error. Without error in strategy, one can then establish merit and build virtue.

To govern the people and manage resources, one must *control and harmonize inwardly*. To order the names of lord and subject, ensuring hierarchy is clear. To regulate taxes and labor, ensuring no disparity between near and far. When hierarchy is clear, duties are distinct. When disparity is absent, burdens are light. Thus, this becomes the foundation of a state. Hence, it is said: *control and harmonize inwardly*.

When the ruler is blind and ungoverned, the people are chaotic and unaware, one must *control and reverse* the situation. When the ruler neglects his duties and the people are unaware of their unrest, the world becomes a land without states, a realm without masters, and those in darkness may act as they please, while those who scorn you will rise. Hence, it is said: *control and reverse*.

When inner alignment is achieved and nothing is left externally, one may persuade and elevate. It is said that a virtuous ruler, confident in his actions, does not retain the praise of others. Such a one creates reputation and spreads it abroad, testing others’ intentions.

If one is summoned, one welcomes and responds. When the ruler’s heart is virtuous, if a summons comes, one greets and obeys it to fulfill one’s purpose. If one wishes to depart, one does so through calculated risk. Like birds that take flight before settling, one departs by offering perilous terms.

Through cyclical transformation and adaptation, no action is forced—this is the way of great propriety. At the juncture of departure or arrival, one weighs what is fitting, turning like a wheel, adapting to change. Though others may not perceive the intent, such retreat is the ultimate in preserving oneself and upholding propriety. *Propriety* is *law*.

**Chapter Four: Looming Collapse (Dǐ Zhí)**
*Dǐ* means to strike firmly; *zhí* refers to cracks and fissures. When walls collapse due to fissures, or structures fail due to hidden flaws, one must strike firmly to reinforce them. Thus, walls and structures will not fail. If ruin is inevitable, one removes it and rebuilds, placing people and affairs accordingly.

Things have their natural order; affairs have their unions and separations. This speaks of unions and separations as natural principles. Some things are near yet unseen, others far yet known. What is near yet unseen is due to not examining their words; what is far yet known comes from reflecting past events to judge the present.

By examining words and observing actions, one can perceive near intent. By reflecting past events to judge the present, one can foresee distant affairs. The past is like the present. Thus, by reviewing the past, one can verify the future. Hence, it is said: *reflect the past to judge the present*.

*Tie* is the altar; the altar is *xián*; *xián* is the beginning of great fissures. When fissures grow vast, collapse is imminent, so one must strike firmly to reinforce.

At the outset, cracks may be *loomed* (mapped) and sealed, struck to repel, struck to suppress, struck to conceal, or struck to resolve. This is the principle of *looming collapse*.

*Ying* refers to the emergence of fissures—its subtle beginnings. What arises internally can be sealed by striking; what comes externally can be repelled; what rises from below can be suppressed; what is nascent can be concealed; what is beyond remedy can be accepted. Deep understanding of these five aspects reveals the true logic of *looming collapse*.

When danger looms, the Sage perceives it, safeguarding their methods, adapting to transform affairs, mastering strategies and schemes to discern the subtle. The Sage operates beyond form—thus, when danger first appears, they are already aware, both clear and wise. Hence, they safeguard their methods.

By adapting to transform affairs, they respond to circumstances, mastering strategies and schemes to weave and measure, discerning the subtle to preemptively guard against it. From the finest hair’s breadth, they act to sway the roots of great mountains.

The Han Emperor Gaozu rose from humble origins to the imperial throne; Tang of the Shang ruled from a hundred li to govern all under heaven. *Jīng* is the beginning; *huī* is movement.

When the signs of external turmoil first emerge—conspiracies lurking like sprouting weeds—all such schemes arise from *dǐzhì* (抵帜), the strategic response to fissures in the Dao, serving as its defense. *[#21]*

When governance falters and external signs of chaos sprout—when rebellious plots begin to take root—sage counsel is invoked to devise strategy. *[#22]* This is because the art of *dǐzhì* lies in seizing these moments. Thus, when the fissures appear, the Way’s defense may be enacted. Hence it is said: *"To block the gap of the banner is to unfold the Way."*

When the realm fractures, with no enlightened ruler above and nobles lacking virtue, then schemers and traitors rise, the worthy are sidelined, the Sage exiled, and deceitful opportunists flourish. Rulers and ministers mislead one another, leading to collapse and mutual destruction—father and son turn against each other, estranged and hostile. This is called the *sprouting of rebellious seeds* (萌牙). Such is the *banner of chaos* (帜坛) for the state. *[伐射]* means to provoke conflict and strike one another.

When the Sage perceives the sprouting of rebellious seeds, they respond with law. If the age can be governed, they block it to seal it off; if not, they block it to seize it. Sometimes they block thus, sometimes they block otherwise—sometimes they counter it, sometimes they overturn it. To block thus is to seal it; to block otherwise is to seize it. To counter it is to aid its logic; to overturn it is to take the land by force.

The governance of the Five Emperors was sealed by blocking; the deeds of the Three Kings were seized by blocking. The Five Emperors’ rule could still be rectified in their time, hence *"blocking to seal it"*—thus the practice of abdication in favor of the worthy. The Three Kings’ era was beyond rectification, hence *"blocking to seize it"*—thus the wars of conquest.

When feudal lords clash, no single victory can be counted upon—at such times, the ability to block determines supremacy. *[This refers to the Age of the Five Hegemons, where dominance came from above.]*

From the union and separation of Heaven and Earth’s cyclical rise and fall, there must always be fissures in the banner—these cannot be ignored. *[合离]* refers to *Yin-Yang negation and affirmation*; the Dao’s true observation reveals that even Heaven and Earth have moments of negation and affirmation, creating these fissures—how much more so for humanity! Thus, it is said: *"These cannot be ignored."*

To discern them through *yáohé* (掉阖)—to wield this Way—is the mark of the Sage. *[牌阖]* is also negation and affirmation. Those who embody the Great Dao to govern human affairs are the Sage. The Sage is Heaven and Earth’s envoy, following humanity to serve the cosmic order—hence *"Heaven and Earth’s envoy."*

If no opportunity arises for blocking, they remain hidden, awaiting the moment. When the moment comes, they act. If it can be aligned with the above, if it can be restrained below—*aligning with the above* means blocking to seal, aiding the age’s governance; *restraining below* means blocking to seize, forcing submission to oneself. *[#23]*

To act in accordance and follow the Way is to guard the sacred essence of Heaven and Earth. *[#24]* Those who follow this Way may occupy the supreme position—thus, they guard the sacred essence of Heaven and Earth.

*(End of Ghost Valley Classic, Volume One)*

**"Fei" (Flying)** refers to raising one’s reputation to exalt and elevate it. **"Jian" (Clamping)** refers to restraining and binding so that they cannot escape.

The method of taking a person begins by raising their reputation to exalt them, and they will inevitably reveal their true intentions and exhaust their resolve without concealment. Only then can one, through their preferences, restrain and bind them so they cannot shift or turn.

In assessing talent and ability, the purpose is to summon those from afar and bring those nearby. By gauging their strategies and measuring their capacities—whether distant or near—one determines their potential. Raising their reputation is how one summons those from afar and brings those nearby.

For instance, when the virtuous are either distant or near, one employs this method to attract them, as in the case of King Zhao of Yan honoring Guo Ju, a matter of historical record.

To establish influence and control affairs, one must first discern distinctions and similarities, separating the threads of right and wrong. Once those from afar and near have arrived, one then establishes the authority of rewards and punishments, regulating the success or failure of their actions.

With the situation thus set, one must first examine the alliances and divisions—whether they align or oppose—and distinguish the truth or falsehood in their words. Observing their inner and outer expressions, one knows the presence or absence of their true capabilities. The outer refers to superficial appearances, the inner to genuine substance; presence or absence refers to the Dao’s unfolding of their abilities or failures.

Again, by observing their true or deceptive words, one discerns whether their capabilities are genuine or feigned. One then resolves matters of safety and peril, determining relationships of closeness and distance.

Having discerned distinctions, separated right from wrong, observed inner and outer expressions, and known presence or absence, one can then arrange matters of safety and peril, and settle affairs of closeness and distance—thus distinguishing the worthy from the unworthy.

Only then does one weigh and measure them. If they harbor hidden intentions, one can then summon, seek, and employ them. Weighing determines their lightness or heaviness; measuring determines their length or shortcoming. Once their lightness or heaviness is revealed, and their length or shortcoming takes form, one applies hidden strategies to aid their alignment or deviation.

Thus, whether summoning, seeking, or employing them becomes possible.

Using the words of **hook-and-clamp**, one flies and clamps them. **"Hook"** refers to luring and revealing their true nature. The talents and dispositions of people vary in rank, so the words of hook-and-clamp also have gradations.

Thus, when employing hook-and-clamp words, if one confuses them internally to reveal their true nature, it is called **hook**; if one praises them externally to reveal their true nature, it is called **fly**. Once their true nature is obtained, one clamps and restrains them so they cannot escape or shift—hence, **hook-and-clamp**, hence **flying hook-and-clamp**.

The language of hook-and-clamp is flexible, sometimes aligning, sometimes diverging. That is, when employing hook-and-clamp words, one may either feign agreement to unite them or feign opposition to separate them—hence, **sometimes aligning, sometimes diverging**.

If they cannot be swayed by this, one may first summon them and then impose burdens. **"Cannot be swayed"** means the hook-and-clamp words fail to move them. Thus, one first issues commands to summon them. **"Imposing burdens"** refers to, once they arrive, revealing their true capacities.

Once they arrive, one then fully reveals their true abilities and defenses, knowing what they can do—some may thus follow and transform. Or, one may first impose burdens and then disparage them. Some, even after revealing their true abilities, still do not follow and transform, so one then exposes their shortcomings to disparage them—those who err may thus follow, indicating they did not understand transformation.

Or, one may use imposing burdens as disparagement, or disparagement as imposing burdens. Some reveal their true abilities, yet their shortcomings become evident—this is using burdens as disparagement. Others, after detailing their shortcomings, are shamed into compliance—this is using disparagement as burdens.

Because they are difficult to move, one may either impose burdens or disparage them, driving and luring them into transformation.

In employing them, one may use wealth, treasures, jade, pearls, white jade, or adornments to serve them. **"Employing them"** means, once they have followed and transformed, one must first know their nature, habits, likes, and dislikes, then move them with wealth or adornments to test their loyalty.

Or, one may measure their abilities and establish influence to hook them—gauging their strengths and weaknesses, then setting the conditions of approach or withdrawal to hook their true nature and discern their intelligence and strategy.

Or, one may observe their actions, see their proficiency, and clamp them—meaning one watches their conduct, sees their skill, and restrains them to know their courage or cowardice.

In applying this method, one uses **blocking and signaling**—meaning these above methods are extensions of blocking and signaling.

When intending to employ them in the world, one must measure their abilities, observe the flourishing or decline of the times, assess the breadth or narrowness of the land, the difficulty or ease of the terrain, the abundance or scarcity of the people and resources, and the alliances of the feudal lords—who is close, who is distant, who is loved, who is hated.

**"Employing them in the world"** means applying the extensions of flying and clamping to assist the emperor. Measuring abilities determines whether the emperor’s capacities can be aided to completion. Observing the times’ flourishing or decline, the land’s breadth or narrowness, and the people’s abundance or scarcity further determines whether the harmony of Heaven, Earth, and humanity aligns with the age’s prosperity or adversity. Examining the feudal lords’ alliances—who is close, who is distant, who is loved, who is hated—further determines whether they will follow or oppose.

Having carefully considered their intentions and inclinations, one knows their likes and dislikes, then speaks to what they value most, using flying-and-clamping words to hook their desires and clamp them in pursuit.

Having carefully examined their intentions and inclinations, knowing their likes and dislikes, one then addresses what they hold most dear. Again, using flying-and-clamping words, one hooks their desires. Having known their desires, one clamps and seeks them. If their desires are not defied, what persuasion would they refuse?

When employing this on people, one measures their intelligence and abilities, weighs their talents and strength, gauges their qi and influence, and sets the pivotal mechanisms to welcome, follow, clamp, and harmonize them according to intent. This is the **continuation of flying and clamping**.

**"Employing this on people"** means applying the extensions of flying and clamping to the feudal lords. Measuring intelligence and abilities, gauging qi and influence also seeks to know their strategic capabilities.

**"Pivot"** is what governs the movement of doors; **"mechanism"** is what governs the release of crossbows.

「Once one has discerned the strategic capabilities—both strengths and weaknesses—of the feudal lords, laws are then established to regulate their movements, as the pivot governs the door’s opening and closing, and the mechanism governs the firing of the crossbow. Sometimes one leads them by welcoming, sometimes follows by yielding, always restraining their emotions to harmonize them and guiding their intentions to suit one’s own purpose. Thus, the feudal lords’ loyalty can be secured, and the ruler’s favor can be firmly maintained.

This is called the **continuation of flying and clamping**—applying the extensions of flying and clamping to people. When used on people, it means sending out empty words while receiving sincere responses, binding them without losing them, and probing their speech to discern their true intent. They may comply with clamping, they may resist it, they may be drawn in or repelled, they may be guided east or west, south or north, or even turned back or overturned. Yet when used on people, it refers to deploying the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** to manipulate them. Only by spreading one’s reputation does this work—hence, "sending out empty words." They, in turn, open their hearts and reveal their true emotions, submitting to you—hence, "receiving sincere responses." Once their emotions are secured, they are bound by the **continuation of flying and clamping** and not abandoned. Further, by spreading their words and observing their speech, one can make them follow, resist, or be bound in any direction. Their reversal or overthrow lies solely in your clamping and guiding, for there is no thought that cannot be subdued. Though they may overturn, they can be restored, never losing their proper measure. Though they may falter or fail, the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** can recover and reassert them, never losing its rhythm and control—this is the **ultimate application of clamping**.

**The Sixth Principle: Unity in Opposition**
The Dao/Way being hidden, the proper path cannot proceed openly, so when one seeks to unite, one must first oppose. This ensures they have no doubt, allowing one to then carry out their intentions—just as the departure of Yi Yin and Lü Shang was the prelude to their unity.

In all cases of seeking unity through opposition, there must be a fitting strategy.
When one seeks unity through opposition, even if the responses are uneven, the application of strategy will make them align. Through transformation and adaptation, they follow suit, each with their own form and momentum, their reversals and overthrows interdependent, and measures established according to circumstances.
The principle of opposition is self-referential: it shifts with the transformation, like links in a chain. Yet their departures and arrivals each have their own patterns—some reverse, some overturn. The principle itself seeks alignment, and no matter the circumstances, measures are established accordingly.

Thus, the sage, positioned between heaven and earth, establishes their standing to govern the world, spreading teachings and proclaiming their name, always adapting to the confluence of circumstances and observing the suitability of the times. They consider what should be expanded or reduced, using this to foreknow and align with transformations. What should be expanded or reduced refers to the proper application of governance and teaching. Once knowing what must be expanded or reduced, one acts accordingly. Hence, "foreknow"—using the principle of opposition to understand.

**Transformation and Adaptation** refers to shifting and conforming to the changes of others.
The world has no fixed nobility, nor do matters have a fixed master.
Ren (benevolence) makes one noble, hence no fixed nobility.
Establishing virtue makes one a master, hence no fixed master.
The sage is always acting without fixed action, always listening without fixed listening—
By using the **continuation of flying and clamping**, they act without restraint.
They do not listen to baseless words, hence no fixed listening.

When matters are completed and strategies align, the sage takes the lead in guiding them.
In matters, they are already accomplished; in strategy, they are already harmonized.
Thus, they are established with the multitude as their leader.
When aligned with one and separated from another, loyalty cannot serve two masters.
When aligned with one but separated from another, their loyalty cannot be fully applied to both.
There must be **opposition through reversal**—
Reversing to this, nature to that, and then reversing again to that.
Its method is this:
Since loyalty cannot be fully applied to both, it is proper to employ the **stratagem of reversal and fear** to manipulate them.

**Reversal and Opposition** means reversing to unite with this, then acting to oppose that.
To act through reversal means to create doubt in their affairs, so that the confused cannot perceive the truth.

When deploying this across the world, one must measure the world and align with it;
When deploying this within a state, one must measure the state and align with it;
When deploying this within a family, one must measure the family and align with it;
When deploying this in personal conduct, one must measure one’s own abilities, strength, and influence, and align with them.
Great or small, advance or retreat—its use remains consistent.
When deploying this, it refers to the extension of opposition.
To measure means to assess the presence or absence of their circumstances.
To align means to cultivate their favor.
Before executing the **stratagem of reversal**, one must first affirm their circumstances and curry their favor, then the hidden ruler will have no way to perceive or awaken, thus allowing the deployment of the **stratagem of reversal** to succeed.

Though the extensions of its application may vary in scale—great or small, advance or retreat—yet when one properly affirms their circumstances and cultivates their favor, it remains consistent in use, hence "its use remains consistent."

One must first deliberate on strategy and define plans before executing them with the **flying-and-clamping stratagem**. When deploying the **extension of reversal and fear**, one must first establish the strategy and plans, then execute them, again using the **flying-and-clamping stratagem** to reinforce and fill the gaps.

The ancients who mastered the art of opposition and reversal
Unified the Four Seas, encompassed the feudal lords’ loyalty, and transformed the land of unity—then sought to align.
Those who deeply understood the principle of opposition and reversal
Unified all under heaven, united the feudal lords, and drove them to the land of unity—then employed methods to transform and shift them.
Once their hearts were aligned, they sought their true ruler and united with them.
Hence, Yi Yin five times approached Tang, five times approached Jie, before uniting with Tang;
Lü Shang three times approached King Wen, three times entered Yin, yet could not clarify his purpose—before uniting with King Wen.
Yi Yin approached Jie and Zhou because their nature demanded no doubt, and since they had no doubt, he could then unite with their true ruler.
This is the **clamping of heavenly command**, hence their submission without doubt.
Heavenly command was tied to Yin, Tang, and King Wen, so the two ministers submitted to the two rulers without doubt.
Without the utmost sage reaching the depths of the Dao/Way, one cannot govern the world;
Without laboring over the mind and exhausting thought, one cannot fathom matters;
Without fully attending to emotions and discerning truth, one cannot establish reputation;
Without refined talent and virtue, one cannot wield armies;
Without genuine sincerity, one cannot know people.»

「Thus, the **Way of harmonizing nature**, one must first assess one’s own talents and abilities, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of one’s **sagely discernment** and **long-term vision**—whether near or distant, who is superior and who is inferior.

The **Way of harmonizing** cannot be applied to those who surpass oneself, but rather to those who do not. Hence, one must know who is inferior before acting. Only then can one advance, retreat, expand, or contract. Once the **Way of harmonizing** is applied to those inferior to oneself, then advancement, retreat, expansion, and contraction are solely as one desires.

**Chapter Seven: *Assessing Power and Discerning Emotions***
The ancient masters who excelled in governing the world would measure the **power** of the world and discern the emotions of the feudal lords. If they did not carefully measure **power**, they would not know the distinctions between strength and weakness, weight and lightness. If they did not carefully discern emotions, they would not know the hidden shifts and changes in their movements and stillness.

What is meant by measuring **power**? It is to gauge the scale of greatness and smallness, to strategize based on the multitude or scarcity of forces, and to evaluate the presence or absence of wealth and resources. The ancient masters who excelled in governing the world would measure the **power** of the world and discern the emotions of the feudal lords. If they did not carefully measure **power**, they would not know the distinctions between strength and weakness, weight and lightness. If they did not carefully discern emotions, they would not know the hidden shifts and changes in their movements and stillness.

Measuring **power** means:
- Gauging the scale of greatness and smallness,
- Strategizing based on the multitude or scarcity of forces,
- Evaluating the presence or absence of wealth and resources,
- Calculating the abundance or scarcity of the populace,
- Assessing whether there is surplus or deficit, and by how much,
- Determining the advantages and disadvantages of terrain—whether it is perilous or easy,
- Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of strategic planning,
- Distinguishing the merit or demerit of ministers—whether they are virtuous or unworthy,
- Judging the wisdom or lack thereof among guests and allies,
- Observing the auspicious or inauspicious signs of Heaven’s timing,
- Deciding which feudal lords to engage and which to disregard,
- Measuring the stability or danger of the people’s hearts—whether they incline toward or away from you,
- And whether they love or hate you.

Through careful observation, one can discern what is convenient. Thus, one can know their emotions. If one does this, their emotions can be understood, and no matter the situation, one can act accordingly.

**Discerning emotions** requires approaching them when their desires are most pronounced to fully explore their cravings. When they have cravings, even a **wooden** figure cannot conceal their emotions. One must then approach them when their fears are most intense to fully explore their aversions. When they have aversions, they cannot conceal their emotions. Emotions and desires will inevitably reveal their changes.

If one is moved by their emotions yet does not perceive these changes, then one should avoid speaking to them and instead question those close to them, to know where their comfort lies. Even if one approaches them during moments of joy or fear to probe their desires and aversions, one may still not know their changes. Thus, one should avoid speaking to them and gradually question those close to them, and their true desires and comforts can then be known.

Emotions that change within are reflected in outward appearance. Therefore, one must always use what is visible to infer what is hidden—this is called **probing and discerning emotions**. Emotions and outward expressions never diverge; internal changes are always mirrored in external appearance. Thus, one must always use outward appearance to infer internal emotions.

Those who observe facial expressions to discern emotions are indeed employing this **Way**. This is called **probing the depths and discerning emotions**.

Therefore, when calculating state affairs, one must carefully assess **power**. When advising a ruler, one must carefully discern emotions. Strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires must emerge from this. If one carefully assesses **power**, then state affairs can be calculated; if one carefully discerns emotions, then one can advise the ruler.

As for strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires, all must be discerned before action is taken. Hence, it is said that strategic planning and understanding emotions and desires also emerge from this.

Then one can determine what is precious or worthless, what is weighty or light, what is advantageous or harmful, what can succeed or fail—all depend on this. If one is precise in **discerning and probing**, then preciousness, worthlessness, success, and failure are all determined by oneself, with nothing outside of **discerning and probing**. Hence, it is said that all depends on this.

Thus, even with the **Way** of the ancient sages and the sagely strategies of the wise, without **discerning emotions**, one cannot uncover the hidden and concealed. This is the fundamental principle of strategy and the method of persuasion. The **Way** of the ancient sages and the sagely strategies of the wise, though vast and profound, mysterious and wondrous, if not combined with the **probing of emotions**, then how can one seek their hidden and concealed aspects?

Therefore, **discerning emotions** is the root of successful strategy and the foundation of persuasion.

There are always matters concerning people, yet people cannot anticipate these matters before they arise—this is the most difficult to achieve. Those who wield the **probing of emotions** also possess the insight of **unique perception**, hence they can anticipate matters concerning people before anyone else.

They can also exhaust all possibilities and perceive all changes, thus anticipating matters before they arise. Without embodying the profound and mastering the mysterious, none can achieve this. Hence, it is said that this is the most difficult to achieve.

Therefore, it is said that **discerning emotions** is the most difficult to master and govern, meaning one must always time their strategic planning. Human emotions are more treacherous than mountains and rivers, and more difficult to fathom than Heaven’s workings. Now, if one wishes to **discern and govern** them, is it not difficult?

Hence, it is said that **discerning emotions** is the most difficult to master and govern. Strategic planning arises from human emotions; one must know their timing and rhythms. This is why it is the most difficult.

Therefore, even the slightest movement of a silkworm—just a tiny insect—contains the potential for advantage or harm, and can give rise to matters. The beauty of **generating affairs** lies in seizing these subtle opportunities. The silkworm’s slight movements are but a humble creature, yet they still carry the seeds of advantage or harm. Thus, if one follows them, they bring joy; if one opposes them, they provoke anger. How much more so with humans, how much more so with ghosts and spirits?

Therefore, advantage and harm are inevitable in affairs, and following or opposing them is the natural course of events. Hence, to invite advantage and avoid harm is the constant principle. Observing this can lead to the beauty of **generating affairs**.

**Generating affairs** lies in carefully assessing subtle opportunities—hence, it is said that the beauty of **generating affairs** lies in seizing these subtle opportunities.»

「This is the art of **divining emotions** and **adapting speech**, crafting discourse only after assessing the situation.

Once the emotions are divined, speech is then refined and followed accordingly—thus, it is said that **adapting speech** must first be shaped into discourse before it can be applied. In the eighth chapter of *The Art of War*, **"Divining"** is the **oath**#13 of the inner strategy. **"Divining"** refers to the one who assesses the emotions and then aligns with their desires.

Hence, **"Divining"** is the extension of **assessing**. The inner **oath** means that emotions and desires stir within, while their manifestations appear externally. **"Divining"** is the act of perceiving these external signs and inferring the inner emotions. Therefore, it is said: **"Oaths"** are the foundation of **divining**.

When employing **divining**, there must be a **Way**. That **Way** must remain concealed.
**Divining** is the means to gauge their emotional inclinations;
**Adapting** is the means to stimulate and align with their inner **oaths**.
To use **divining and adapting**, one must first establish the principle.
Thus, it is said: *"When employing it, there must be a **Way**."*

Then, to measure emotions by emotions, emotions being inherently subtle and concealed, it is said: *"That **Way** must remain hidden."*

By **adapting subtly**, one tests and probes their desires, and the inner **oaths** will surely respond. When they respond, they will inevitably act as desired.
Once the emotions are divined and their inclinations known, one then **adapts subtly** to their desires, and when their desires are met, emotions will surely stir.
Testing and probing them, thus the inner **oaths** will respond.

So, when the **oaths** respond, one must withdraw subtly to fulfill their intended actions.
This is called **blocking fate and concealing intent**, hiding one’s true appearance and evading emotions so that others remain unaware—thus, one’s plans succeed without misfortune.

The ruler, having already determined the actions, can then **adapt** to fulfill them.
The minister’s affairs are best when left **unseen**, for completion brings an end—thus, one withdraws subtly.
If one does not align with this strategy, the credit for success will go to the ruler.
This is akin to **blocking fate and concealing intent**, **hiding appearance and evading emotions**.

When emotions are concealed and intent is blocked, how can others know?
If others do not know the means by which one **restrains** their borrowed ruin, then one’s affairs can be completed without **restraint**.

**"Divining"** lies here, **"oaths"** lie there—aligning and responding to them, there is no affair that cannot be accomplished.
This **adapting** is so subtle, yet its effects are naturally evident.
The observer sees only the results and not the subtlety itself.
Thus, when employing this method, success is assured—there is no affair that cannot be accomplished.

The ancient masters of **adapting** were like those who cast a hook into the depths—baiting it and hiding the line, they were sure to catch the fish.
Hence, it is said: *"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing, conquers battles without others fearing."*

The fisherman reveals the bait but conceals the hook—thus, the fish does not see the bait, yet the hook is obtained.
The **virtuous** observe the results of their actions but conceal their **adapting**—thus, others do not know, yet they are naturally swayed.
Therefore, it is said: *"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing."*

Victory in battle stems from **adapting** well—when **adapting** is concealed, there is no source from which to fear, hence it is said: *"The ruler conquers battles without others fearing."*

The **Sage** plans in secrecy, hence it is called **mysterious** (*shen*);
They accomplish it openly, hence it is called **illuminated** (*ming*).
**Mysterious** planning is concealed and hidden, daily actions unknown—like the **Dao/Way**’s inscrutable path, hence it is called **mysterious**.
When affairs are completed and plans fulfilled, their brilliance shines clearly—hence it is called **illuminated**.

So, the saying *"The ruler completes affairs without others knowing"* means they do not see the means of advantage, yet they recognize the **Way**;
*"The ruler conquers battles without others fearing"* means they trust the **Way** and are unaware of the reasoning behind it—hence, they liken it to **mysterious and illuminated** (*shenming*).

The **Sage** embodies the **Dao/Way** and establishes teachings, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth to effect transformations. They **conceal** their brilliance and **hide** their paths, **reserving** their actions while **displaying** their **virtue**.
Thus, people cannot comprehend their **borrowed ruin** (*shen*), yet they follow the **Dao/Way** without knowing its reasoning—hence, they liken it to **mysterious and illuminated**.

Constantly waging war through **non-contention** (*buzheng*), they **restrain** disaster within their own hearts and minds, using **non-contention** as their method of war.
No armies are raised—**virtue** flows naturally, and the people are all unaware of the reasoning behind their **fearlessness**.
One **adapts** with their anger;
One **adapts** with their balance, one **adapts** with their rectitude—」

「One **adapts** with their joy,
One **adapts** with their reputation, one **adapts** with their deeds;
One **adapts** with their integrity, one **adapts** with their **virtue**;
One **adapts** with their profit, one **adapts** with their humility.

These ten aspects of **non-contention** (*buzheng*) are all ways to **stir** (*mó*) the people’s **varying** (*cānchā*) **nature** (*xìng*), their **breathing** (*qì*) of **fullness** and **emptiness**.
Those who **adapt** with their anger accumulate **virtue** and **power** (*shàn*), restraining evil before it sprouts—
Thus, the **Dao/Way’s** subtle winds spread far and wide,
And the people remain **unaware** of why they submit—
They liken it to **mysterious and illuminated**.

Matters shift and change.
Thus, those who **stir** (*mó*) must also **adapt** to the **factors** (*qǐ*) that move them.

The **still** (*jìng*) is **non-contention** (*buzheng*);
The **rectified** (*zhèng*) is **adaptation** (*mó*).
**Reputation** (*míng*) is **adapted** to ensure the people are at ease and follow—
Thus, the state’s affairs are accomplished without effort.
**Joy** (*xǐ*) is **adapted** to bring delight;
**Deeds** (*xíng*) are **adapted** to achieve completion;
**Integrity** (*lián*) is **adapted** to bring purity;
**Trust** (*xìn*) is **adapted** to bring clarity.
**Profit** (*lì*) is **adapted** to seek gain;
**Humility** (*bēi*) is **adapted** to flatter.

**Reputation** (*míng*) must be **exalted** and **promoted**—
Hence, it is called **exaltation** (*fā*).
**Deeds** (*xíng*) must be **completed**—
Hence, it is called **completion** (*chéng*).

Thus, what the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) uses alone,
Others also possess,
Yet none achieve success—
Their use is incorrect.

It is said that the **Sage** alone **adapts** these ten matters,
Using **non-contention** (*buzheng*) to achieve success and establish affairs,
Yet common people all have them as well.

If their use is **borrowed ruin** (*shen*), not the **Dao/Way**—
Then success cannot be attained.

Thus, **planning** is most difficult when it must be **thorough**,
**Persuasion** is most difficult when it must be **fully heard**,
And **affairs** are most difficult when they must be **certainly completed**.

These three challenges—
Only the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) can then accomplish them.

If **planning** is not **thorough**,
Then the **opportunity** (*xī*) is lost, and the **endeavor** (*chéng*) is harmed.
If **persuasion** is not **fully heard**,
Then **harmony** (*shùn*) is defied, and **doubt** (*yí*) arises.
If **affairs** are not **cross-completed** (*cházhéng*),
Then **work is abandoned midway** (*zhǐzhuì*), and **ruin** (*fèi*) follows.

All these are difficult for others to bear,
Yet none find difficulty in them—
Only the **Sage** can do so.

Thus, **planning** must be **thorough**,
And **persuasion** must be **fully heard**—
One must **choose** those with whom they can **communicate** (*tōng*) to speak.

Hence, it is said:
*"Some bonds are sealed without gaps."*

To those who can **communicate** (*tōng*), one **adapts** their **planning**—
**Receiving** (*shòu*) it as **empty** (*xū*), like water receiving a stone,
Opening currents to **harbor** (*nà*) springs.
Thus, no gaps can be found—
Hence, it is said:
*"One bond is sealed without gaps."*

If **affairs** are to be **completed**,
They must **align** with **fate** (*shù*).
Thus, it is said:
*"The **Dao/Way** of **fate** (*shù*) and **timing** (*shí*) must **correspond** with **fortune** (*yǎnshù*)."*

If **planning** is to succeed,
It must first **consider** aligning with **fortune** (*yǎnshù*).
Thus, the **Dao/Way** of **fortune** (*yǎnshù*), **timing** (*shí*), and **fate** (*shù*) must all **correspond**—
Then **affairs** can be **completed**, and **achievements** (*gōngyè*) can be **established**.

If **persuasion** is to be **heard**,
The **listener** must **align** with their **sentiments** (*qíng*).
Thus, it is said:
*"The **listener** must **align** with their **sentiments** (*qíng*)."*

To **advance** (*jìn*) **persuasion** and ensure it is **heard**—
Only those who **align** with **sentiments** can do so.

Thus, **things** return to their **kindred** (*lèi*).
Carrying wood toward fire,
The **dry** (*zào*) ignites first;
Pouring water on level ground,
The **moist** (*shī*) is first **soaked**.

This is how **things** of the same **kindred** (*lèi*) **respond** to **circumstances** (*shì*).
It is like this as well.

This speaks of the **inner resonance** (*nèifú*) **responding** to **external adaptation** (*wàimó*).

If **kindred** (*lèi*) is **obtained** (*dé*), then **response** (*yìng*) follows—
Like water flowing to the **moist** (*shī*), fire advancing to the **dry** (*zào*).

Thus, it is said:
*"**Adapt** with their **kindred** (*lèi*)—
Yet if there are those who do not **respond**,
Then one must **adapt** with their **desires** (*yù*)—
Yet if there are those who do not **listen** (*tīng*)."*

The **Way** of solitary action.
Only those skilled in **adaptation** (*mó*) could be the **Sage**.
Thus, the **Way** of solitary action is as such.

The **opportune** (*jǐ*) is never too late—
When accomplished, it is not clung to;
When enduring, it transforms naturally.
To act upon the **opportune**—what tardiness could there be?
When the deed is done, it is not constrained—
What lingering could there be?

Practicing these two can transform the world.

**Chapter Nine: The Art of Persuasion**
The one who persuades does so by **endowing** (*zī*).
The persuader **endows** the other.
**Endowing** means **taking** (*qǔ*).
**Embellishing speech** is a **borrowing** (*jiǎ*)—
**Borrowing** means **augmenting or diminishing** (*yì*).

The persuader **embellishes** speech to **appease** the other,
Yet it is not the **essence** of the matter.
Since it is **borrowed**, there must be **augmentation or diminution**.
Thus, **borrowing** means **augmenting or diminishing**.

The **responder** uses **convenient words**—
**Convenient words** are **light discourse** (*qīnglùn*).
When asked, one **responds** and **replies**—
Yet it is merely **convenient words**.
Since words seek **convenience**, the discussed matter naturally becomes **light discourse**,
Not **true speech** (*zhìyán*).

The **completer of meaning** **clarifies**—
**Clarifying** means **verification**.
Examining **substantial matters** to establish **principles**,
Seeking to **verify** truth and falsehood.
Once truth and falsehood are **clarified**, **verification** naturally follows.
Thus, **clarifying** means **verification**.

When words **contradict**, it is to **repel**—
**Difficult speech** is **repelling discourse**—
**Repelling discourse** is **fishing for the opportune** (*diào jǐ*).
When words do not align, they **contradict and challenge**,
Thus **repelling** prior discourse.
**Repelling discourse**—
When logic is **precise** and matters **clear**, the **subtle** can be fully **exhausted**.
Thus, **repelling discourse** is **fishing for the opportune**.

To seek the **profound and subtle**, it is called **fishing**.

**Flattering speech** is **sycophantic yet claims loyalty**—
**Stuffing** (*xiàn*) means **anticipating intent** to fulfill desires,
Seeking the name of **loyalty**, hence **sycophantic yet claims loyalty**.

**Flattering words** are **verbose yet claim wisdom**—
**Verbose** means **prolific in rhetoric** to seek the name of **wisdom**, hence **verbose yet claim wisdom**.

**Bold speech** is **reckless yet claims courage**—
**Reckless** means **unhesitating abandonment**, seeking the name of **courage**, hence **reckless yet claims courage**.

**Mournful speech** is **scheming yet claims sincerity**—
**Mournful** means **feigning sorrow** in speech.
**Scheming** means **strategizing and advancing counsel** to seek the name of **sincerity**, hence **scheming yet claims sincerity**.

**Calm speech** is **contradictory yet claims victory**—
**Calm speech** means **feigning purity** in speech.
**Contradictory** means **prematurely denying** to **block the false**, seeking the name of **victory**, hence **contradictory yet claims victory**.

**Anticipating intent to fulfill desires** is **sycophancy**,
**Prolific in rhetoric** is **verbosity**,
**Strategizing and advancing counsel** is **scheming**,
**Unhesitating abandonment** is **recklessness**,
**Prematurely denying to block the false** is **contradiction**.

When one’s **true self** is insufficient,
Yet **unaware**, they **internally dispute**,
And **counterattack** others’ faults,
**Blocking** others’ objections—
This is **contradiction**.

Thus, the **mouth** is the **mechanism**—
It **closes** emotions and intentions;
The **ears and eyes** are the **auxiliaries** of the **heart**—
They **spy** on questions and **expose deceit**.

Thus it is said:
**Harmonize the three** and **respond**,
**Benefit the Dao** and **act**.
The **mouth** is for **uttering speech**, hence the **mechanism**.
Emotions and intentions depend on the **mechanism**, hence **closing** them.
The **ears and eyes** assist the **heart** in **understanding principles**, hence **auxiliaries**.
When the **heart** uses **ears and eyes**, it can **spy on gaps** and **see deceit**, hence **exposing deceit**.

When the **ears, heart, and eyes** are **harmonized** and **responsive**,
Their **action** will **succeed**—
Nothing will be **unfavorable**.
Their **unfavorableness** is **nonexistent** because they **move with the Dao**.
Thus, **harmonize the three and respond**, **benefit the Dao and act**.

Thus, when **speaking is struck** yet **not disordered**,
When **soaring** yet **not confused**,
When **changing** yet **not perilous**—
This is **grasping the essential** and **obtaining principle**.

If one can **perceive the essential** and **grasp principle**,
Then **flexibility** will **succeed without loss**.

Thus, though **speech is tangled yet not disordered**,
Though **soaring is boundless yet not confused**,
Though **changing** departs from **constancy yet is not perilous**—
This is so.

Thus, the **blind** cannot be shown **five colors**,
The **deaf** cannot be told of **five tones**.
**Five colors** are for those with **eyes**,
Hence the **blind** cannot be **shown** them.
**Five tones** are for those with **ears**,
Hence the **deaf** cannot be **told** of them.
These two are **divisions** for what follows.

Thus, what cannot be **sent forth** has **no opening** for it,
What cannot be **received** has **no acceptance** for it.
There are **things that do not communicate**—
Hence the **Sage** does not **attend** to them.
What cannot be **persuaded** in the other is because they are **obtuse and stagnant**, with **no opening**.
What the other does not **persuade** here is because they are **shallow and narrow**, with **no acceptance**.

The **shallow and narrow** and the **obtuse and stagnant**
Are always **blocked** and **uncommunicative**,
Hence the **Sage** does not **attend** to them.

The ancients said:
*The mouth can eat, but not speak.*
**Speech** has **taboos and prohibitions**.
**Many mouths** can **melt gold**—
This is because **speech has hidden motives**.
The **mouth** can **nourish** the **hundred bodies**, hence it can **eat**.
Yet **speech** can **summon** the **hundred calamities**, hence it cannot **speak**.
**Speech** **touches taboos and prohibitions**, hence **taboos and prohibitions**.
Gold is a **durable thing**, yet **many mouths** can **melt** it—
This is because **many mouths** have **private motives**.
Thus, **speech has hidden motives**.

Human **nature**—
When **speaking**, they desire to be **heard**;
When **acting**, they desire **success**.
What is **hearable** depends on **aligning** with the other,
What is **successful** depends on **following principle**.
This is the **beginning** for what follows.

Thus, the **wise** do not use their **weaknesses** but use the **strengths** of the **foolish**,
Do not use their **clumsiness** but use the **skills** of the **foolish**,
Hence they are **not constrained**.
The **wise**’s **weaknesses** cannot **overcome** the **foolish**’s **strengths**,
Hence they use the **foolish**’s **strengths**.

The **wise**’s clumsiness cannot overcome the **foolish**’s skill, hence they use the **foolish**’s skill.
If one can always abandon their clumsiness and use the **foolish**’s skill, they will not be constrained.

When speaking of what is beneficial, one follows their strengths;
When speaking of what is harmful, one avoids their weaknesses.
If one follows the strengths of what is beneficial and avoids the weaknesses of what is harmful,
Then their speech will be heard, and their actions will succeed.

Thus, the **armored insect**’s fierceness must rely on its **solidity**,
The **stinging insect**’s movement must rely on its **venom**.
Hence, **birds and beasts** use their strengths,
And the **orator** knows how to use their advantages.

The **armored insect** hides itself with its **solidity**,
The **stinging insect** moves with venom to defend itself—
This is using their strengths.
Thus, they can avoid harm.

Even other birds and beasts do not fail to use their strengths to preserve themselves.
The **orator**, observing this, also knows what to use and how to use it.

Thus, there are **five kinds of speech**:
**Illness**, **grievance**, **worry**, **anger**, and **joy**.
If any one of these five arises, it disrupts **harmony** and **clarity**.

Thus:
**Illness** arises from **weakened qi** and **lack of spirit**—
The ill are **dazed**, so their qi is weak and their spirit is absent.
**Grievance** arises from **ruptured intestines** and **lack of mastery**—
The grieved are inwardly agitated, so their intestines are ruptured and their speech lacks control.
**Worry** arises from **blockage** and **no release**—
The worried are **restless**, so they are blocked and their speech does not flow.
**Anger** arises from **reckless movement** and **lack of restraint**—
The angry are **stifled and surging**, so they move recklessly and their speech is uncontrolled.
**Joy** arises from **dissipation** and **lack of focus**—
The joyful are **shaken**, so they scatter and their speech lacks purpose.

These five, when **refined**, are used;
When **advantageous**, they are applied.
Since these five deviate from **moderation**, their use must be **refined**, and their application must be **advantageous**.
If they are neither refined nor advantageous, they are abandoned.

Thus:
When speaking with the **wise**, rely on **breadth**;
With the **clumsy**, rely on **clarity**;
With the **eloquent**, rely on **concision**;
With the **noble**, rely on **authority**;
With the **wealthy**, rely on **elevation**;
With the **poor**, rely on **benefit**;
With the **lowly**, rely on **humility**;
With the **bold**, rely on **daring**;
With the **reckless**, rely on **sharpness**.

This is the **method**, yet people often reverse it.
This is the **measure** for appropriate speech—
Those who do not understand reverse it,
And thus act against **principle**, failing to avoid harm.

Hence:
When speaking with the **wise**, use this to **illuminate** them;
When speaking with the **unwise**, use this to **teach** them—yet it is difficult.
To speak with the **wise**, present this **method** clearly;
To speak with the **unwise**, teach them this **method**—
But since people’s confusion deepens over time, teaching them is difficult.

Thus, **speech** has many **categories**, and **actions** have many **changes**.
Hence, it is said:
If speech does not lose its **category**, then actions will not be disordered.
Speech is **diverse and intricate**, hence many **categories**.
Actions adapt to **circumstances**, hence many **changes**.
If speech does not lose its **category**, then actions will not be disordered.

To remain unchanging yet not lose **principle**—
This is why the **wise** value **not acting rashly**.
Not being disordered, they do not change,
Thus their **principle** remains constant.
Those who can maintain constancy without change—
This is the **use of wisdom**, hence their wisdom is **precious and not rash**.

Listening values **acuity**,
Wisdom values **clarity**,
Speech values **originality**.
If listening is **acute**, truth and falsehood are not confused;
If wisdom is **clear**, right and wrong are self-evident;
If speech is **original**, right and wrong have **proof**.

If these three are practiced, then **achievement** and **success** are secured—
Hence they must be **valued**.

**Chapter Ten: Planning**
In human affairs, planning follows **human nature**.
Obtain the **foundation**, and the **foundation** must be obtained,
Then seek its **pattern**, and **human nature** can be sought.
Seeing **human nature** and planning, then no matter is left unfinished.

Carefully obtaining **human nature**, one establishes the **Three Complements**.
They are: **Middle**, **Low**.

Using these three to verify, then **strange strategies** can arise.
The **Three Complements** are:
**Upper**—to generate **strangeness**.
**Strangeness** does not know its **origin**, beginning from ancient **patterns**.

The three are used together to verify,
Then **strange strategies** can emerge.
Once **strange strategies** arise, they are universally effective—
Yet they are **obscured**.

Measuring **talent** and **ability**, one does not know their **limitations**.
Yet these **strange strategies** did not originate today or yesterday.
Thus, those of **shared nature** and **affinity** begin from antiquity, following **principle**.

The **South-pointing chariot** is used for those who do not **weigh circumstances**—
Yet it is also a **guide** for those whose affairs succeed together.
Those of **shared desire** but **estranged**—
These are those who **harm each other**.
All who share **nature** and **desire** to **plan and act together**:
If their affairs succeed together, later they will be **affectionate**;
If one succeeds and one is harmed, later they will be **estranged**—this is **principle**.

Those who share **hatred** and are **affectionate**—
These are those who **harm each other together**.
Those who share **hatred** but are **estranged**—
These are those who **harm each other partially**.
**Shared hatred** means they are **hated by the same**.
Later, if both are harmed, their **nature** will be **affectionate**;
If one is spared and one is harmed, **principle** dictates they will be **estranged**—
This too is **principle**.

Thus, **benefit brings closeness**, **harm brings estrangement**—
This is the **constant law**.

This is how one discerns the **division of similarity and difference**—
Their **categories** are the same.

The **division of similarity and difference** is examined using this.
Thus, walls collapse at their **cracks**,
Wood breaks at its **knots**—
This is their **division**.

Walls and wood are destroyed because of **cracks and knots**,
How much more so in **human affairs**, where **changes arise from similarity and difference**!
Thus, it is said: This is their **division**.

Thus, **changes arise from affairs**,
Affairs arise from **planning**,
Planning arises from **strategy**,
Strategy arises from **debate**,
Debate arises from **persuasion**,
Persuasion arises from **advancement**,
Advancement arises from **retreat**,
Retreat arises from **control**.

Using **control** to govern **affairs**,
Thus, all **affairs** follow **one path**,
And all **methods** follow **one principle**.

「Speaking of affairs, they have **fundamental roots** and **origins**—
Each has its own source, like plants and trees that grow from roots into branches, twigs, flowers, and leaves.
Thus, it is said: **#30 The Way of Change** unfolds,
And then **affairs and undertakings** emerge.

Those who bring forth **affairs and undertakings** must first devise **strategy and planning**.
Those who perfect **strategy and planning** must first engage in **debate and persuasion**.
**Debate and persuasion** must be weighed for their **correctness or error**,
Thus, **advancement and retreat** are required.

Once **dismissal and elevation** are determined,
**Affairs** must be set as **precedent**,
And then all **undertakings and methods**—what is there that does not arise from this?
Their **Dao and principles** are singular.

The **virtuous person** holds **wealth in light regard**,
Cannot be tempted by **gain**,
But can be moved to **expend**;
The **brave warrior** scorns **hardship**,
Cannot be deterred by **calamity**,
But can be urged to **embrace peril**;
The **wise strategist** grasps **principles** and understands **logic**,
Cannot be deceived by **false sincerity**,
But can be shown **reason and rightness**,
And thus **achieve merit**—
These are the **Three Talents**.

If you lead those who hold **wealth in light regard** to **expend**,
Then **wealth** can be preserved;
If you guide those who scorn **hardship** to **embrace peril**,
Then **peril** can be **calmed**;
If you inspire those who grasp **principles** to **achieve merit**,
Then **merit** can be **accomplished**.

Combining these **Three Talents** and applying them,
One can **illuminate** a thousand *li* (leagues),
Why limit oneself to mere **twelve strategies** alone?

Thus, the **foolish** are easily **obstructed**,
The **unworthy** are easily **intimidated**,
The **greedy** are easily **enticed**—
This is **adapting to circumstances**.

Using these **three strengths**,
And **countering** those **three weaknesses**,
One can **establish undertakings** and **achieve merit**.

The **planner** must **study circumstances** and **adapt accordingly**.
Thus, it is said: **Adapt to circumstances**.

Therefore, the **strong** must **accumulate weakness**,
And the **abundant** must **accumulate insufficiency**—
This is the **Dao of flexibility** in practice.

**Softness overcomes hardness**,
Thus, **accumulating weakness** can bring **great strength**.
**Straightness follows curvature**,
Thus, **accumulating curvature** can achieve **straightness**.
**Fewness gains multitude**,
Thus, **accumulating insufficiency** can yield **abundance**.

Hence, **using weakness as strength**,
**curving as straightness**,
**insufficiency as abundance**,
This is the **Dao of flexibility** in action,
Thus, it is called: **The Way of Adaptive Practice**.

Therefore, when advising a ruler whose **inner trust is distant** while **outerly close**,
Speak of the **inner**;
When advising a subject whose **inner trust is close** while **outerly distant**,
Speak of the **outer**.

If **outerly close in appearance** but **innerly distant in truth**,
Then speak of the **inner** to **remove internal estrangement**.
If **innerly close in truth** but **outerly distant in appearance**,
Then speak of the **outer** to **remove external estrangement**.

Thus, **exploit their doubts** to **transform** them,
**Confirm their perceptions** to **settle** them—
If **inner and outer** are not close and one harbors **doubt**,
Then **exploit their doubt** and **change** them.
If they **perceive** something and **hold a view**,
Then **confirm their perception** to **establish** it.

**Leverage their arguments** to **bind** them,
**Exploit their momentum** to **complete** it—
Once **views** are shaped, there are **positions of approach or withdrawal**,
Then **exploit their momentum** to **fulfill** it.
Once **positions** are set, if **evil persists**,
Then **weigh their evil** to **counterbalance** it,
And **dismiss their remnants** to **repel** them.

**Gently press** to **frighten** them,
**Heighten risks** to **stir** them—
Once **evil is dismissed**, if they **rely on victory** and **become arrogant**,
Then **press them gently** to **instill fear**,
And **expose them to peril** to **shake** their confidence.

**Subtly correct** to **align** them,
**Use omens** to **respond**—
Though **fear and agitation** may take hold,
If they still **do not understand change**,
Then **subtly present evidence** to **verify** it,
And **set up signs** to **confirm** the truth.

**Surround and block** them,
**Disrupt and confuse** them—
This is called **strategy and planning**.

Though **evidence and signs** are presented,
If they still **do not understand change**,
This is perhaps **too deep to remedy**—
Then **surround and block** them,
**Disrupt and confuse** them,
And **counter their resistance** to **gain** them.

Thus, one can **employ strategy and planning**.

The **application of strategy and planning**,
**Public methods** are not as effective as **private**,
**Private** is not as effective as **binding**—
**Binding** means **no gaps**.

**Public methods** are proclaimed in the **royal court**,
Known as **litigious assembly**,
Where **no one bears blame**,
And their **undertakings are hard to fulfill**.
**Private methods** do not leave the **inner court**,
Are **cautious and precise**,
And their **merits can be achieved**.

Thus, **public methods are not as effective as private**.

Even **secret planning** is not as effective as **binding with them**.
Two people with **unified hearts**,
No **external force** can **pierce** them—
To seek their **gaps**, how possible is it?

**Directness** is not as effective as **indirectness**—
**Indirectness** is **unending flow**.

**Directness** follows **logic** and **holds to constancy**,
Is **difficult to advance swiftly**.
**Indirectness** **inverts principles** yet **aligns with rightness**,
**Undertakings** **match the moment** like **crossbows** firing.

Thus, **directness is not as effective as indirectness**.
When **indirect strategies** are **executed once**,
They **circulate endlessly** and **no one knows their end**.

Thus, it is said: **Indirectness flows without stopping**.

Therefore, when advising a **sovereign**,
One must speak of **indirectness**,
And when advising a **minister**,
One must speak of **privacy**.

Speaking of **indirectness** to a **sovereign**,
Then **extraordinary merit** can be **achieved**;
Speaking of **privacy** to a **minister**,
Then **self-preservation** can be **fully secured**.

If their **body is inwardly aligned** yet their **words outwardly distant**,
Then the **superficial** become **estranged**;
If their **body is outwardly distant** yet their **words inwardly profound**,
Then the **deeply placed** are **in peril**.
If one’s **body is inward** yet their **words outward**,
Then the **leaky** are **again estranged**;
If one’s **body is outward** yet their **words deep**,
Then the **urgent** are **again in peril**.

Do not **force upon others** what they **nearly dislike**,
Do not **teach others** what they **do not know**.

If the **undertaking** is **close at hand** yet they **dislike it**,
Do not **force** it upon them—
They will **harbor resentment and anger**.
When **teaching others**, use what they **already know**—
Now to **teach them what they do not know** is like **using darkness to dispel darkness**,
How can this be **beneficial**?

People have **likes**—
**Study** and **align** with them;
People have **dislikes**—
**Avoid** and **conceal** them,
Thus, **hidden paths** are **taken** while **open paths** are **chosen**.

**Study** and **align** with what people **like**,
**Avoid** and **conceal** what people **dislike**—
Do this **in secret**;
Not **contrary** to their **nature**,
They will **respond with joy**—
Then **clearly state** to **reward** them.

Thus, it is said: **Hidden paths are taken while open paths are chosen**.

Therefore, to **remove** them, **grant freedom**,
And to **grant freedom**, **exploit their momentum**—
When you wish to **remove** them,
First **listen to their freedom**,
Let them **push their transgressions to extremes**.

Once their **transgressions are extreme**,
Then **apply the law** to **counter** them.

Thus, it is said: **"To indulge is to exploit them."**

**Appearance**—
Neither beautiful nor ugly, hence **truthful emotions** are **entrusted** to it.
**Appearance** refers to observing people’s **demeanor** to discern their **emotions**,
That is, when they see good, they do not praise it,
And when they see evil, they do not condemn it.
Those who act thus can **entrust** their **truthful emotions** to it.
Hence, it is said: **"Truthful emotions are entrusted to it."**

What can be **known** can be **employed**,
What cannot be **known** is what the **planner** does not **employ**.
It is said that their **emotions** are broad and subtle,
Those who can be made to **know** can be **employed** in **planning**,
Hence, it is said: **"What can be known can be employed."**
Those whose **emotions** are not broad and subtle,
Those who cannot be made to **know** are not **employed** in **planning**,
Hence, it is said: **"What cannot be known is what the planner does not employ."**

Therefore, **matters** are **valued** in **controlling others**,
And not in being **controlled** by others.
**Controlling others** is **holding authority**,
Being **controlled** by others is **submitting to fate**.
**Submitting to fate** means one’s **fate** is **controlled** by others.
Hence, the **Dao/Way** of the **sage** is **hidden**,
The **Dao/Way** of the **fool** is **open**,
The **Dao/Way** of the **sage** is **internally open** yet **externally hidden**,
The **Dao/Way** of the **fool** is **internally hidden** yet **externally open**.

The **wise** find **matters** easy,
The **unwise** find **matters** difficult.
From this perspective, **perishing** cannot be **preserved**,
And **danger** cannot be **made secure**,
Yet it is said: **"The Way of non-action values wisdom."**

The **wise** are **forgiving**,
Hence **matters** are easy for them;
The **foolish** are **suspicious**,
Hence **matters** are difficult for them.
Yet even the **unwise** may suffer **perishing** or **danger**,
Because their **matters** are difficult,
Thus the **virtuous** cannot **fully implement** their **strategies**—
Then the **perishing** will **perish**, the **dangerous** will **remain dangerous**,
And to **seek security** and **preservation** is not also difficult?
Now, if one wishes to **preserve** the **perishing**,
And **secure** the **dangerous**,
Then none but the **wise** can do it.
Hence, it is said: **"The Way of non-action values wisdom."**

Wisdom is **employed** where the **multitude** cannot **know**,
Yet can be **employed** where the **multitude** cannot **see**.
What the **multitude** cannot **know**,
What the **multitude** cannot **see**,
Only the **wise** can **employ** it,
Thus wisdom is **valued** above all.

Once **employed**,
If what is **seen** is **appropriate**,
Choose **matters** and act upon them—
This is to act for **oneself**;
If what is **seen** is **inappropriate**,
Choose **matters** and act upon them—
This is to act for **others**.
It is also said:
When wisdom is **employed**, first for **oneself**, then for **others**,
If what is **seen** is **appropriate**,
Choose **matters** and act upon them—
This is to act for **oneself**;
If what is **not seen** is **inappropriate**,
Choose **matters** and act upon them—
This is to act for **others**.
It is like **Bo Le** teaching the **cherished** yet **discarding the unworthy**,
And **rewarding the diligent** yet **abandoning the sluggish**.

Hence, the **Dao/Way** of the **ancient kings** had **hidden words**,
Saying: **"The transformation of Heaven and Earth lies in loftiness and depth."**
The **sage’s** **establishment** of the **Dao/Way** lies in **concealment** and **obscurity**,
Not merely in **loyalty, sincerity, benevolence, and righteousness**,
But in **moderation and rectitude** alone.
It is said that the **Dao/Way** of the **ancient kings** values **hidden subtlety**.
Examining the **ancient remnants**,
Verifying that this **principle** exists,
It is said: **"The transformation of Heaven and Earth lies only in loftiness and depth,
The sage’s establishment of the Dao/Way lies only in concealment and obscurity."**
What is **concealed** is **moderation and rectitude**,
Naturally **harmonizing** with the **Dao/Way**,
Not **exclusively** in **benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and sincerity**.
Hence, it is said: **"Not merely in loyalty, sincerity, benevolence, and righteousness."**

When the **principles** of the **Dao/Way** are **understood** to this extent,
Then one can **discuss** them.
It is said that the **planner** **grasps** the **principles** of the **Dao/Way**,
If one can **reach** this **extent** and **be fluent**,
Then one can **speak** to the **highest** and **most profound** **levels**.
From **obtaining** this,
One can then **discuss** the **far and near** **principles**#33.
**Discuss** means **nurture**.
If one **obtains** this **Dao/Way’s principle**,
Then one can **hold** the **great treasure** **position**,
**Nurture** the **far and near** people,
And **lead** them to the **domain of longevity**.
**Decision** Chapter Eleven

In **ordinary matters**,
When **entrusting** to **people**,
One must **entrust** to those who **doubt**,
For **good use** brings **blessing**,
And **bad use** brings **calamity**—
**Good** extends to **leading** them.
Only after **doubt** does one **entrust**,
Hence, it is said: **"Again, entrust to those who doubt."**

**Nearly** **people’s** **emotions**,
When **blessing** is **employed**, are **good**,
When **calamity** is **employed**, are **evil**.
The **principles** of **blessing** and **calamity** are **not yet clear**,
Thus **doubt** arises from them.
Hence, it is said: **"Good use brings blessing, evil use brings calamity."**

Yet, those who **follow** after **doubt**,
First **lead** them to **obtain** their **emotions**,
Then can **determine** their **appropriateness or inappropriateness**.
**Ultimately**, there is **no confusion** or **partiality**,
Only **benefit** can arise.
Remove their **benefit**,
And they will **not accept** it.
This is the **strange** **entrustment**.

**Holding doubt** is **confusion**,
**Not being upright** is **partiality**.
Those who **follow** without **confusion** or **partiality**,
Then the **doer** will have **success and guidance**,
And **blessing and benefit** will arise.
If one **removes** their **blessing and benefit**,
Then the **doubters** will **not accept** their **followers**.
**Further**, **entrust** one’s **intentions** to the **strange**.

**Tending toward novelty** and **changing constancy**,
Is called **strange**#36.
If there is **benefit** in **goodness**,
And one **conceals** and **entrusts** it to **evil**,
Then they will **not accept** it,
And it will **lead to estrangement**.
It is said that the **doubters**, **based on their benefit**,
And **goodness**, yet the **followers** **conceal** their **benefit** and **goodness**,
And **entrust** it to **evil**,
Then the **doubters** will **not accept** their **followers**,
And it will **lead to estrangement**.

Hence, there are those who **cause loss of benefit**,
And those who **cause separation from harm**—
This is the **failure** of **matters**.
It is said that the **two upper** **methods**,
Sometimes **remove benefit** and **entrust to evil**,
The **doubters**, having **not accepted** their **followers**,
Then what is **done** will **not succeed** in **guidance**.
Hence, there are **failures** in **loss of benefit** and **suffering harm**.
All these are the **failures** of **matters**.

The **sage** can **accomplish** their **matters** through **five methods**:
There are those who **employ** **open virtue**,
Those who **employ** **hidden guile**,
Those who **employ** **sincerity and trust**,
Those who **employ** **concealment and obscurity**,
And those who **employ** **moderation and simplicity**.
The **sage** excels in **adaptation and flexibility**,
Exhausts the **principles** of **things**,
And **nearly** **matters** **are completed** through them.
When **matters** are **completed** and **principles** are **established**,
**Open virtue** is **employed**;
When **emotions** are **hidden** and **words** are **false**,
**Hidden guile** is **employed**;
When the **Dao/Way** is **established** and **intentions** are **straightforward**,
**Sincerity and trust** are **employed**;
When **deceit** is **minor** and **harm** is **slight**,
**Concealment and obscurity** are **employed**;
When **following constancy** and **holding to the old**,
**Moderation and simplicity** are **employed**.
**Open virtue** is **encouraged** with **one word**,
**Hidden guile** is **encouraged** with **two words**,
**Moderation and simplicity** serve as the **pivot and mechanism** for **employment**,
And the **fourth** is **subtle** yet **applied**.
**Encourage** means **exhort**.
**Open** is the **Dao/Way** of the **ruler**,
Hence what is **spoken** is **also encouraged** with **one word**.

One—**non-action**. The **shadow** is the **path of the subject**, hence what is spoken is also **exhorted with two words**.
Two—**action**. The **ruler’s path** is **non-action**, hence **moderation and simplicity** are the **primary**.
The **subject’s path** is **action**, hence **pivot and mechanism** are **employed**.

When **one** is spoken, when **two** is spoken, when **moderation and simplicity** are applied, when **pivot and mechanism** are used—these four methods in their **application** are **refined and subtle**, **harmonizing with the profound**, then **affairs proceed** and **principles face no difficulty**.

Thus, **measuring past events**, **verifying future ones**, **consulting moderation and simplicity**, if **proper**, then **employ it**.
When **ruler and subject** have **fixed roles**, then **measure the past**, **verify the future**, **consult moderation and simplicity**, **calculate right and wrong**—if **in accord with principle**, then **employ it as a method**.

In **public and royal affairs** of **great lords**, when **dangerous yet glorious**—if **proper**, then **decide upon it**.
Danger arises from **height**—when **affairs are lofty** and **reputation glorious**, then **employ it as a method**.

When **effort is spared** and **success is easy**—if **proper**, then **employ it**.
This is called **"benevolence without expenditure"**, hence **employ it as a method**.

When **effort is exerted**, **labor is strenuous**, yet **inevitable**—then **employ it**.
This is called **"knowing what cannot be helped"**, **"accepting it as fate"**, hence **employ it as a method**.

To **remove calamity**—if **proper**, then **employ it**.
To **follow blessing**—if **proper**, then **employ it**.
To **reject calamity** and **follow blessing** is the **greatest harmony of principle**, hence **employ it as a method**.

Thus, **settling doubts with sincerity** is the **pivot of ten thousand affairs**.
To **restore order from chaos**, to **determine success or failure**—this is **difficult to execute**.
Order is restored by **uprightness**, success or failure is **decided by method**—a **hair’s breadth** off, and the **result is miles apart**.
The **triggering of mechanisms** is the **source of honor and disgrace**, hence it is said: **difficult to execute**.

Thus, the **ancient kings** used **tortoise shells and milfoil** to **consult themselves**.
Though the **ancient kings’ sagacity** was **omniscient**, they still **cast divination** to **determine methods**. How much more should those **below them** dare to **rely solely on themselves**, without **seeking counsel from the wise**?

**The Twelfth Canon: Concordant Speech**
When **words are spoken**, they **must be verified**, like **seals and contracts**, hence it is called **Concordant Speech**.

**Calm, composed, upright, and tranquil**—those they **reach** are **nourished**.
*"Reach"* means **extend**; *"nourished"* means **abundant**.
When a **person in position** can be **calm, composed, upright, and tranquil**, then **all they influence** are **well-regulated and abundant**.

**Giving generously yet remaining tranquil**, with a **vacant heart and even mind**, awaiting **depletion or loss**—
When a **ruler** is **skilled in bestowing favors** yet **not tranquil**, only by **vacant heart and even mind** can they **await it**, for **depletion or loss** will **surely arrive**.

**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **position**.
Those who **hold position** must be **calm, composed, upright, and tranquil**.

**Eyes value clarity**, **ears value acuity**, **mind values wisdom**.
**Clear eyes** see **nothing unseen**, **acute ears** hear **nothing unheard**, **wise mind** thinks **nothing unperceived**.
If these three are **unobstructed**, then **what action is not appropriate**?

To **see with the world’s eyes** is to **see nothing unseen**, to **hear with the world’s ears** is to **hear nothing unheard**, to **plan with the world’s wisdom** is to **know nothing unknown**.
In the **age of Emperor Yao**, **bright and enlightened**, **cultivating the world**, he **employed this method**.

**Radiance and fragrance advance together**, then **clarity cannot be blocked**.
The **sage does not act alone**—their **brightness and wisdom** are **delegated to the world**.
Thus, the **clear-seeing govern**, the **acute-hearing listen**, the **wise advise**.
Like **following the dragon**, **wind following the tiger**, **inevitable yet unchecked**.
**Radiance and fragrance advance together**—how could it be otherwise?
Like **sun and moon shining**, how could they be **blocked**?
Hence it is said: **clarity cannot be blocked**.

**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **clarity**.
Those who **hold clarity** do so by **seeing with the world’s eyes**.

**The art of virtue** is: **do not rigidly reject**.
**Nurturing virtue** lies in **expansiveness and inclusivity**.
Mountains **do not reject dust**, hence they **achieve height**; seas **do not spurn tides**, hence they **achieve depth**.
The **sage does not repel the multitude**, hence they **achieve greatness**.
Thus it is said: **do not rigidly reject**.

**Permit them, and they will guard**; **reject them, and they will close off**.
If you **permit and embrace**, the **multitude will return and defend**.
If you **reject and oppose**, the **multitude will rebel and stagnate**.
To **nurture virtue**, how can one **fail to be expansive and inclusive**?

Mountains **can be measured in height**, depths **can be fathomed**—yet **divine and enlightened positions**, **upright and tranquil**, **cannot be measured**.
Mountains **cannot exceed height**, depths **cannot exceed depth**—yet **divine and enlightened positions**—when **approached, no front is seen**; when **followed, no rear is seen**. How can they be **measured**?

**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **virtue**.
Those who **hold virtue** do so by **embracing expansiveness and not resisting**.

**Rewards must be trustworthy**, **punishments must be just**.
**Trustworthy rewards** make **meritorious officers** **risk life for duty**.
**Just punishments** ensure **those executed** **die without resentment**.

**Rewards must be trustworthy**—**verify what eyes and ears witness**; what is **unseen and unheard** will **inevitably transform**.
When **bestowing favors and rewards**, if **ears and eyes verify** without **error**, and **actions align with merit**, then **trust precedes speech**, and even the **unseen and unheard** will **harmonize**.

**Sincerity permeates the divine and enlightened**—how much more so for **deceitful schemers** daring to **assail the ruler**?
This is like **rotten meat before sharp blades**—**no harm will come**.

**The sovereign’s virtue** lies in **rewards**.
Those who **hold rewards** value **trustworthiness**.

**The Threefold Sovereignty of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity**

One is **Heaven’s**, one is **Earth’s**, and one is **Humanity’s**.
Heaven has the **order of逆顺** (inverse and compliance),
Earth has the **principles of孤虚** (loneliness and emptiness),
Humanity has the **divisions of通塞** (flow and obstruction).
Those who hold **the Mandate of Heaven** must all know these.

In **all directions—above, below, left, right, front, and back**—
where is the **wandering star (荧惑)**?
For **all directions—above, below, left, right, front, and back**,
there are **proper alignments of yin and yang**, **facing and turning**—
these are what **governors and officials must not fail to understand**.
Moreover, **荧惑** is **Heaven’s legal star**—
where it resides brings **disaster to the blue-green** (east),
and its **auspicious or inauspicious influence is particularly pronounced**.
Thus it is said:
Even **a sagely monarch** must **scrutinize where 荧惑 resides**.
Therefore, one must also **know this**.

**The Sovereign’s Questions**
The sovereign who **questions** must **discern the Dao of the Three Powers (三才)**.
The **heart governs the nine orifices**,
the **ruler is the leader of the five senses**.
The **nine orifices move as the heart directs**,
and the **five senses act as the ruler commands**.
For those who do **good**, the ruler **bestows rewards**;
for those who do **wrong**, the ruler **inflicts punishments**.
**Rewarding the good and punishing the wrong** is the **great principle of governance**.
The ruler **follows the means by which governance is sought**—
if he **responds accordingly**, there will be **no labor**.
**Responding** means **granting what is requested**;
**requesting** means **seeking without fulfillment**.
If **requests are met**, then **giving and receiving are not arbitrary**;
if **what is given is received**, then **actions proceed without delay**.
Moving in accordance with **nature**, what **labor is there**?
The **sage employs this**, and thus **can reward appropriately**.
Following **principle**, it **endures without fail**.
Responding to **requests**, there is **no greater joy**.
Even without **jade and silk**, the **encouragement is as if rewards were given**.
Yet if **one acts against principle**, **disaster comes swiftly**.
Following **principle**, it **endures long**—
this is the **sovereign who responds**.

**The Sovereign’s Response**
The sovereign who **responds** must **follow principle**.
The ruler **cannot be neglectful**.
If the ruler is **neglectful**, then **crafty ministers arise**, and **the people are oppressed and rebellious**.
**Neglect** means **not comprehending the principles of things**.
When **principles are not fully known**, then **crafty ministers cause chaos**.
**Business (家)**—like **crafts**—becomes **unstable**,
and **inner and outer affairs are disconnected**.
How can one **know what to open**?
**Business (家)** here means **enterprise**.
Since **crafty ministers are in chaos**, what they **undertake is unstable**,
and **inner and outer affairs are blocked**—
**obstacles abound on all paths**.
How can one **know what to open**?
If **opening and closing are mismanaged**, the **source of good governance is unseen**.
**Opening and closing** refer to **牌阖** (the art of strategic disclosure and concealment).
Since **牌阖’s principles are not applied**, the **source of good governance remains hidden**.

**The Sovereign’s Comprehensive Knowledge**
The sovereign who **comprehends** must **know the principles of all things**.
One is **long-sightedness (长目)**,
two is **flying ears (飞耳)**,
three is **establishing clarity (树明)**.
Using **the eyes of all under Heaven to see**, hence **long-sightedness**.
Using **the ears of all under Heaven to hear**, hence **flying ears**.
Using **the minds of all under Heaven to deliberate**, hence **establishing clarity**.
With **clarity**, one **knows a thousand li away**,
and **what is hidden and subtle**—
this is called **penetrating all under Heaven**.
**Delinquents cannot conceal their schemes** in their hearts.
For **using the minds of all under Heaven to deliberate**,
there is **nothing unknown**—
thus, **a thousand li away**, **hidden and subtle matters** are **all discerned**.
Since **hidden things are exposed**, those who **plot evil** will **abandon their schemes in their hearts**.
Thus it is said: **They cannot but change**.

**The Sovereign’s Reverence**
The sovereign who **reveres** must **possess keen intelligence and refined thought**.
Following **names to achieve reality**, one **remains secure and complete**.
When **reality matches the name**, this is **security**.
**Names and reality** generate each other,
and **oppose each other in their essence**.
Following **names to achieve reality**,
and **from reality generating names**—
when **names and reality are not deficient**, **essence resides within**.
Thus it is said:
**When names are correct, reality arises from them**,
**and reality arises from principle**.
**Names are correct and naturally arise from reality**,
**reality is established and naturally arises from principle**.
**Principle arises from the virtue of names and reality**—
if there is **no principle**, then **names and reality naturally generate virtue**.
**Virtue arises from harmony**, and **harmony arises from correctness**.

**The Sovereign’s Names**
The sovereign who **names** must **align with reality**.
The treatises *Zhuàn Wán* and *Guāng Luàn* are **lost**.
Some have **filled in the gaps with Zhuāng Zhou’s *Zhuàn Kuāng*** in sequence.
**Note:** The *Ghost Valley Classic* **exalts stratagems and deceives sagely wisdom**.
While **Zhuāng Zhou’s *Zhuàn Kuāng*** **portrays the sage as a tool for great thieves**,
and **sagely laws as failures of Jiè and Kùi**,
it claims that **those who disrupt all under Heaven are sages**.
It seems to **encourage abandoning sagely wisdom**,
**driving an age into chaotic obscurity**—
this is **far from the book’s intent** and **has no merit**.
Some say *Zhuàn Wán* and *Zhuàn Kuāng* are **the lost sections of the *Inner Classic*** (本经中经).

**End of Ghost Valley’s Scroll.**
**The Inner Canon of *Yin-Fu* (阴符) – Seven Chapters.**

**The Inner Canon of *Yin-Fu* – Seven Chapters (Continued)**

**Yin-Fu** is the private intention within, the response of things without.
Like matching seals and contracts, hence it is called *Yin-Fu*.
From its root to its unfolding, hence it is called the **Root Canon**.
It embodies the **Five Dragons**—the Dragons of the Five Phases.
The Dragon transforms without end, the **qi** is unfathomable in yin and yang—
thus the **Way** of nurturing the **spirit** follows the Five Dragons.

Within nurturing the **spirit** are the Five **qi**:
the **spirit** is their sovereign,
the **heart** their dwelling,
**virtue** their envoy.
The **Way** is where nurturing the **spirit** ultimately returns.

The Five **qi** are the **qi** of the Five Zang:
the **spirit**, the **hun**, the **po**, the **jing**, and the **zhi**.
The **spirit** dwells among the four others, hence it is their sovereign.
The **heart** can harmonize and contain, hence it is their dwelling.
**Virtue** can subdue evil #1, hence it is their envoy #2.
Yet matters of nurturing should return to the **Way**.

The **Way** is the origin of heaven and earth,
the single thread of all things.
It is the source of all things, what heaven generates,
encompassing boundless formless **qi**,
existing before heaven and earth,
its form unseen, its name unknown—
thus it is called **spirit-soul**.
Without name, it is the origin of heaven and earth.
Hence it is said: The **Way** is the origin of heaven and earth.
The **Way**’s initial generation is One,
hence it is called the **single thread**.
Speaking of the **Way**’s mixed creation,
how yin and yang mold and refine—
all things are born and transformed through it,
heaven and earth generated by it,
boundless and vast, its form unseen.
As for the **qi** of nurturing and growth,
it precedes heaven and earth in formation,
cannot be described by form or defined by name,
yet it subtly permeates all things—
thus it is called **spirit-soul**.
Therefore, the **Way** is the source of **spirit-brightness**,
the single principle of transformation.
Thus **virtue** nurtures the Five **qi**.

The **heart** can attain the One,
and thus its **wei** #4 arises.
**Spirit-brightness** discerns the **Way** and is born—
hence it is said: The **Way** is the source of **spirit-brightness**.
If the principle of transformation is not singular,
there are times when transformation does not occur—
hence it is said: the **single principle of transformation**.
Following principle to completion is called **virtue**.
Each of the Five **qi** follows principle,
and thus success can be achieved—
hence it is said: **virtue** nurtures the Five **qi**.

The One is that which acts without action and is naturally so.
The **heart** can act without action,
and its unfolding arises spontaneously—
hence it is said: The **heart** attains the One,
and thus its unfolding arises.

**Wei** is the **Way** of the **heart’s qi**,
the path by which it dwells—
the **spirit** is its envoy.
When the **heart’s qi** aligns with the natural **Way**,
unfolding arises.
The unfolding’s **Way** comes from alignment #4—
thus the **spirit** is its envoy.

The nine orifices and twelve dwellings are the gates and thresholds of **qi**,
the **heart’s** total governance.
Received from heaven at birth, it is called the **True Person**.
The **True Person** is one with heaven.
The twelve alignments are:
the eyes seeing color,
the ears hearing sound,
the nose receiving fragrance,
the tongue tasting flavor,
the body sensing touch,
the mind contemplating affairs—
the roots and fields mutually interpenetrating and aligning,
hence called the twelve alignments.
**Qi** enters and exits through them,
hence they are the gates and thresholds of **qi**.
Only the **heart** governs them,
hence they are the **heart’s** total governance.
All these are received from heaven,
unspoiled in their original nature—
hence it is called the **True Person**.
The **True Person**’s body is identical to heaven,
hence it is said: one with heaven.

Yet those who know this internally refine and cultivate,
and are called **Sages**.
The **Sage** knows by analogy.
Internal refinement is learning through study—
though the **Sage** is wise, still relying on learning.
Learning is not natural—
hence it is said: knowing by analogy.

Thus, when people are born,
they all emerge from the transformation of things.
Speaking of people born together in heaven and earth,
they share the One.
After emerging, they follow things and transform—
thus they differ.

Knowing by analogy at home,
there are doubts and confusions.
The orifices #5 pertain to the nine openings,
yet their doubts also connect with unfolding.
If the **heart** lacks unfolding,
the **wei** is blocked.
When it is unblocked,
the Five **qi** are nurtured—
the task is to dwell the **spirit**,
this is called transformation.

When the **heart’s** unfolding is unblocked,
the Five **qi** are naturally nurtured.
Yet nurturing the Five **qi** requires
the **spirit** to return and dwell.
When the **spirit** returns and aligns,
transformation follows principle naturally.

The Five **qi** of transformation are:
**zhi**, **sī** #6, **spirit**, and **virtue**.
The **spirit** is their sovereign—
calm and harmonious, it nurtures **qi**.
When **qi** is nurtured in harmony,
the four do not decay.
Their fourfold influence and power
achieves all things.
Preserving and dwelling them is called **spirit-transformation**.
Returning to the body, it is called the **True Person**.

Speaking of those who can transform:
it lies in perfecting the Five **qi**.
The **spirit** is their sovereign—
speaking of unifying **zhi** and **sī** to rule them.
The **spirit** being sovereign,
it can be calm and harmonious, nurturing **qi**.
When **qi** is nurtured,
**virtue** is also harmonized.
The four are **zhi**, **sī**, **spirit**, and **virtue**.
If the four do not decay,
their fourfold influence and power
achieves all things.
Constantly preserving and aligning them,
the **Way** of the **spirit** transforms and returns to the body.
When **spirit-transformation** returns to the body,
it is called the **True Person**.

The **True Person** aligns with heaven and harmonizes with the **Way**,
holds the One to nurture all things,
embracing the **heart** of heaven,
applying **virtue** and nurturing—
without action, encompassing all,
using **zhi**, **sī**, thought, and intention
to wield influence and power.

The **scholar** is one whose **spirit** is fully awakened,
thus able to nurture **zhi**.
The One is without action.
Speaking of the **True Person** nurturing all things,
embracing the **heart** of heaven,
applying **virtue** and nurturing—
all done without action.
Hence it is said: holding the One to nurture all things.
As for **zhi**, thought, and intention,
moving influence and power—
all are natural and follow principle.
Hence it is said: without action, encompassing all.

Yet who can fully grasp this **Way**?
Only the virtuous **scholar** can.
Having awakened the **spirit**,
only then can **zhi** be nurtured.

Nurturing the **zhi** follows the **Linggui** [灵龟].

**Zhi** discerns right and wrong,
while the **Linggui** foretells auspicious and inauspicious omens.
Hence it is said: nurturing **zhi** follows the **Linggui**.

Nurturing **zhi** means harmonizing and unifying,
so that the **heart-qi**’s thoughts are unrestricted.
It is said: the **heart-qi** is unrestricted.
Thus, one must nurture **zhi** to seek unification.

When there is desire, **zhi** is stored and pondered.
**Zhi** is the guide of desire.
If desires multiply, **zhi** scatters;
when **zhi** scatters, it becomes weak;
when **zhi** weakens, thoughts are not realized.
This shows that those who indulge desires cannot nurture **qi** and **zhi**,
and thus their thoughts are not realized.

When the **heart-qi** is unified, desires do not overwhelm;
when desires do not overwhelm, **zhi** and intention do not weaken;
when **zhi** and intention do not weaken, thoughts reach their essence.
This shows that those with few desires can nurture their **zhi**,
and thus their thoughts reach their essence.

When essence is realized, harmony and unification arise,
and turbulent **qi** does not vex the chest.
Harmony and unification mean all things are attuned and unrestricted,
so turbulent **qi** naturally dissipates.

Thus, internally one nurtures **qi**,
externally one knows others.
Nurturing **zhi** makes the **heart** unified,
knowing others clarifies their roles.
A unified **heart** brings tranquility to the self,
clear roles bring peace to the world.

To employ others, one must first know their nurtured **qi** and **zhi**,
discern their strengths and weaknesses to nurture their **qi** and **zhi**,
and observe their comfort to know their capabilities.
To employ others is called the **Wei** [卫] of nurturing **zhi**.

Nurturing **zhi** strengthens **qi**,
neglecting it weakens **qi**.
When strength and weakness manifest,
their comfort and capabilities become known.

Thus, those skilled in nurturing **zhi** are those with few desires.
If **zhi** is not nurtured, the **heart-qi** is not steadfast;
if the **heart-qi** is not steadfast, thoughts are not realized;
if thoughts are not realized, **zhi** and intention are not firm;
if **zhi** and intention are not firm, responses lack vigor;
if responses lack vigor, **zhi** is lost and **heart-qi** becomes hollow;
if **zhi** is lost and **heart-qi** is hollow, the **spirit** is forfeited.
This shows that losing the **spirit** begins with failing to nurture **zhi**.

When the **spirit** is lost, the hair and beard wither,
and the convergence of **zhi**, **heart**, and **spirit** is disjointed.
Withered hair and beard signify a lack of clarity.
Convergence refers to the interplay of **zhi**, **heart**, and **spirit**.
If the **spirit** lacks clarity, errors multiply,
and thus the three cannot align in unity.

The beginning of nurturing **zhi** lies in self-cultivation.
When self is cultivated, **zhi** and intention become firm.
When **zhi** and intention are firm, **virtue** and power are undivided.
**Spirit** and clarity must be steadfastly guarded to divide them.
Cultivation means few desires and a tranquil **heart**.

When **virtue** and power are not divided,
**spirit** and clarity are ever-present and steadfast.
Thus, **virtue** is refined and power moves all things.
**Virtue** refined means dispersion is lost,
power moving means one’s **virtue** can influence others.
Hence it is said: only then can they be divided.

Firm intention follows the **Tengshe** [腾蛇].
Intention has twists and turns,
while the **Tengshe** bends and stretches,
hence firm intention follows the **Tengshe**.

Firm intention is the **qi**’s contemplation.
When intention is firm, **qi** is balanced;
when **qi** is balanced, contemplation is precise.
Thus it is said: firm intention is the **qi**’s contemplation.

The **heart** desires tranquility,
contemplation desires depth.
A tranquil **heart** honors **spirit** and clarity,
deep contemplation perfects strategies.
When **spirit** and clarity are honored, **zhi** cannot be disordered;
when strategies are perfected, achievements cannot be obstructed.
**Zhi** cannot be disordered, so strategies are fulfilled.
Achievements cannot be obstructed, so the realm is secured.

When intention and contemplation are settled,
the **heart** naturally becomes tranquil,
and all actions are without error.
The **spirit**, when obtained, becomes concentrated.
When the **heart** is tranquil,
things act without effort and follow their nature,
requiring no thought yet perceiving the profound.
Thus, even if the **heart**’s actions are without error,
the **spirit** naturally attains it.
When attained, nothing remains unaccomplished.
Concentration means fulfillment.

If **qi** is lodged externally,
the deceitful gain leverage,
and false schemes cause confusion,
so words no longer emanate from the **heart**.
Lodged means guest lodging—**qi** is not genuine, only borrowed.
Thus, the deceitful gain leverage,
and false schemes cause confusion.
So words become mere chest utterances, no longer from the **heart**.

Thus, one must uphold **heart**-methods,
guard the **True One** without transformation,
and await the convergence of others’ intentions and contemplations,
listening and observing them.

It is said: the **heart** guards sincerity and clarity without loss,
the **True One** is steadfast and unchanging.
Only then, when interfacing with others,
do sincere and earnest individuals fully express their intentions,
the wise offer their strategies,
and the enlightened present their plans,
so that all align in harmony.

Using the **heavenly ear** to listen,
one can discern the omens of things.
Strategies are the pivot of life and death;
if contemplation does not converge,
listening will not be precise.
If observation fails, strategies are lost,
and intention finds nothing to rely on—
only emptiness remains, devoid of substance.
Strategies succeed, life is preserved;
strategies fail, death ensues.
Hence it is said: strategies are the pivot of life and death.

If contemplation does not align with things,
listening serves no purpose.
If listening is not precise,
how can observation succeed?
Contradicting observation while scheming—
what else is this but failure?
If strategies fail, on what can intention depend?
Only hollow pretense remains, no longer sincere.

Thus, the contemplation of strategies
must begin with firm intention.
Firm intention originates from the **heart**’s **Wei** [卫].
Without action yet seeking,
cultivating tranquility for the five **zang** [脏],
harmonizing the six **fu** [腑],
so that **spirit**, **shen**, **hun**, and **po** guard their domains unmoving,
one can then internally gaze and reflectively listen,
settling **zhi** in the boundless void,
awaiting the **spirit**’s comings and goings.

It is said: to seek the way of tranquil **heart**,
one must be serene and without action.
Thus, the five **zang** are tranquil,
the six **fu** are harmonized,
**spirit**, **shen**, **hun**, and **po** each guard their roles,
calm and unmoving,
so one can internally perceive the formless
and reflectively hear the soundless.
When **zhi** and contemplation are settled,
the **Great Void** arrives,
and myriad **spirits** and clarities converge upon oneself.

Through observing the unfolding of Heaven and Earth,
one knows the myriad things’ creation and transformation,
sees the completion and origin of **Yin** and **Yang**,
and grasps the principles of human affairs.
Without stepping outside, one knows the world;
without peering through windows, one sees the **Dao** of Heaven.
One issues decrees unseen,
and attains without movement.

Only the **spirit** does this—
serene and unmoving,
yet responsive and thus in harmony with the world’s essence.
To know what is unknown,
to see what is unseen,
does one truly need to step outside or peer through windows and doors?
No, for decrees are issued unseen,
and attainment comes without movement.

This is called **Dao-knowing**,
which harmonizes with **spirit** and **ming**,
responding to the boundless while the **spirit** abides.

The **Dao** is without thought,
without action.
Yet **Dao-knowing**—
does it require knowing to know?
Because it is without knowing,
it can harmonize with **spirit** and **ming**,
respond to the boundless,
and welcome the **spirit**’s arrival.

**Abiding** is akin to **dwelling**.
The **Wei** [威] and **division** of **law** [法] subduing the bear:
**Qi** [精] and **emptiness** [虚] moving creatures is called **Wei**,
and **near** or **far** is called **division**.

When the bear strikes,
the **spirit** first **dwells** and then moves,
thus the **division** of **Wei** and **law** subdues the bear.
**Wei** is the **spirit**’s **covering**—
**covering**, like **garments** and **cloaks**.
When **spirit** and **ming** are **cloaked** in stillness,
then their roles can be **divided**.

Thus, when one cultivates **serene** stillness and **firm** resolve,
the **spirit** returns to its **dwelling**,
and the **Wei**’s **covering** flourishes.
To perfect the **spirit**’s return,
one must cultivate **serene** stillness and **firm** resolve,
so that the **spirit**’s **Wei** and **covering** are grand and resplendent.

**Dwelling** is the **abode** of resolve and intent.
When **Wei** and **covering** are flourishing,
then the **inner substance** [内实] is firm.
If the **inner substance** is firm,
then nothing can oppose it.

「If nothing opposes it,
then one can **divide** the **Wei** of others,
and move their **effort** like the **Heavenly** [天].
When **Wei** is flourishing externally,
then the **inner resolve** is firm and solid.
**Form** and **covering** complement each other—
who dares oppose it?
No thing can oppose it.
If no thing can oppose it,
then the **Wei’s division** is complete.

When **Wei’s division** moves,
then all things stand in solemn reverence,
fearing the person as if they were **Heavenly**.
To grasp the **real** and discard the **empty**,
to take the **possessed** and leave the **void**,
is like weighing **pearls** with a **standard measure**.
When **Wei** and **effort** are grand and resplendent,
and figures stand in solemn reverence,
it means I am **real and possessed** while they are **empty and void**.
Thus, one can take their **empty** with my **real**,
and leave their **void** with my **possessed**.
The **taking** [取] is like the **moving of the stalks** [动爻] in response—
just as weighing **pearls** completes the **standard measure**.
Twenty-four **candareens** [铢] make one **standard measure** [镒].
Thus, the **moved** must follow,
the **sung** must harmonize.
**Twist** one finger,
observe the rest—
when the **moving** and **changing** appear in **form**,
no one can intervene.
When **Wei’s division** and **effort** shake things like the **wind**,
then the **moved** has **followers**,
and the **sung** has **harmonizers**.
But **twist** their fingers,
and call them by name,
then the **Wei** and **things** all arrive,
gradually in order,
like **calming nature** [性安],
each allowed to find its place.

Thus, the **wind** moves them,
the **changing** transforms them—
like clay in the potter’s hands,
the **Wei** and **instruments** of **things** reveal their **forms**.
So, the world rejoices,
and it is **pushed** without **satiation**,
who could **question** it?
To **examine** the **harmonizing** and **responding**,
and **question** reveals the **question**—
when the **moving** and **changing** are clear,
then **Wei** can be **divided**.

When one **examines** the **harmonizing** and **responding**,
and **knows** the **question**,
then one can **question**—
thus, one can **clearly** move and change,
and **Wei** can be **divided**.
Before **moving** and **changing**,
one must first **nurture resolve**,
and **conceal intent** to observe the **question**.
Once able to **nurture resolve**,
and **conceal intent** to see the **question**,
then the **unfolding** of **moving** and **changing** can be achieved.

**Knowing** their **fixed resolve** is self-**nurturing**,
**yielding** to others is **nurturing** others.
Thus, **spirit** remains **internal** while **effort** is **external**,
and **form** and **effort** can be established.
This is like the **method of dispersing effort** to startle the **crow** [乌].
**Effort** is dispersed only after **things** submit—
just as the **crow** strikes prey and gains.

Thus, **dispersing effort** is the **spirit’s deployment**.
**Effort** arises from the **spirit’s** movement,
so **effort** is the **spirit’s** deployment.
When used,
it must follow the **question** to move.
Without the **question**,
**effort** cannot proceed—
thus, when used,
it must also follow the **question** to move.
When **Wei** is solemn and **internal resolve** is resplendent,
and it is **pushed** through the **question**,
then **effort** is dispersed.

**Dispersing effort** is when the **heart** is **empty** and **resolve** overflows.
If the **heart** is **empty**,
then **things** are all **encompassed**;
if **resolve** overflows,
then **matters** proceed without **obstruction**—
thus, one can disperse **effort**.
When **intent** is lost to **Wei** and **effort**,
**spirit** is not **concentrated**,
then their **words** are **external** and **deceptive** in **change**.
If **resolve** and **intent** are **weakened** and **lost**,
then **effort** is **defeated**;
if **spirit** is **damaged** and **unfocused**,
then **words** are **loose** and **deceptive** in **change**.

Thus, **observe** their **resolve** and **intent** as **measurements** [度数],
then **infer** and **explain** their **plans** and **matters**.
**Measurements** are fully **rounded** and **square**,
**leveling** the **short** and **long**.
**Know** their **resolve** and **intent** as **ascending** or **declining**,
then one can establish the **measurements**.
Once the **measurements** are set,
then one can **infer** and **explain** them.
To **map** their **matters**,
one must also **fulfill** the **logic of roundness** and **squareness**,
and **harmonize** the **uses of short** and **long**.
Without **measurements**,
**effort** cannot be dispersed.
**Dispersing effort** is waiting for the **question** to move—
when **effort** moves,
it is **divided**.
If **effort** cannot **observe** the **question**,
then it does not proceed.
Thus, **dispersing effort** is waiting for the **opportunity** to move.
When it moves and **obtains** the **question**,
then **effort** is **divided**.

Therefore, those skilled in **thinking through the question**,
must **refine** the **Five Qi** [五气] **internally**,
and **observe** the **empty** and **real** **externally**—
when they move,
they do not lose the **truth** of **division** and **dispersion**.
The **Five Qi** must be **refined internally**,
then one can **externally** **discern**.
If the **logic of empty** and **real** is not **lost**,
then the **question** can also be **known**.
If there is a **question** and one **knows** it,
then one can **not lose** the **truth** of **division** and **dispersion**.

When one moves,
they follow their **resolve** and **intent**,
and **know** their **strategies** and **plots**.
**Strategies** and **plots** are the **forms** of **resolve** and **intent**,
so one follows their **resolve** and **intent** to **know** their **strategies**.

**Effort** is the **pivot** of **benefit** and **harm**,
the **Wei** of **strategic adaptation**.
The **defeated in effort** are those who do not **solemnly observe** with **spirit**.
If **spirit** does not **solemnly observe**,
then **effort** is **defeated**.
The **method of turning roundness** is like the **fierce beast**.
When **strategies** are **endless** and **unfathomable**,
they are like the **fierce beast**.

**Turning roundness** is when **matters** arrive,
like the **endless roundness** of turning.
**Turning** is like the **unending威** of beasts.
**Turning roundness** is the **method** of **unfathomable strategies**.
The **unfathomable** **heart** and **unmeasurable** **mind**,
with **original** and **unfathomable** **techniques**—
the **sage’s heart** is like a **mirror**,
**things** respond as they are **sensed**,
so the **unfathomable** **mind** and **techniques** of the **heart’s unfolding** can be **communicated**.

Yet, the **Dao/Way** of **spirit** is **mixed and indistinct** as one **principle** without **end**.
To **discuss** the **ten thousand variations** of **meaning**,
once the **sage’s heart** **originally** **unfathomably** **mixes** the **indistinct**,
and **wonders** at **things** in **dimness** and **change**,
then the **unfathomable** **meaning** can be **explained**.
**Wisdom** and **strategies**, **plots** and **calculations**,
each have **manifestations**—
either **yang** or **yin**,
either **auspicious** or **inauspicious**,
either **fortune** or **misfortune**.
There must be a **sage** with **unfathomable wisdom** to **communicate**,
to **unfold** the **heart’s intentions**—
thus, even in the **Dao/Way** of **spirit**,
one can **categorize** its **ten thousand types**,
whether **round** or **square**,
as **matters** differ,
then **plots** arise.
When **plots** arise,
either **yin** or **yang**,
then **matters** are **settled**.
**Matters** have no **fixed standard**,
so their **manifestations** differ—
the **round** **operates** endlessly without **division**,
the **square** **stops** with **boundaries**,
**yin** means **plots** are **hidden** and **not yet revealed**,
**yang** means **actions** are **manifest** and **clear**,
**auspicious** means **blessing** arrives,
**inauspicious** means **calamity** comes.
All these **matters** are **reversible**.
Thus, the **sage** **embraces** this **use**,
**turning roundness** to seek its **harmony**.」

Thus, the **sage** follows the **Dao/Way** of **turning roundness** in thought,
to seek **harmony** and **fluidity** in **alignment**.

Therefore, the **origin** of **nurturing** and **transforming** is **creation**,
and all **movement** and **action** encompass the **Great Dao/Way**,
to **observe** the **domain of the numinous and luminous**.

The **sage** embodies the **Dao/Way**,
using **movement** as **function**,
and **spirit** as its **attendant**.

**Heaven** thus **nurtures** and **transforms** through **teachings** and **cultivation**,
its **movement** and **action** first **aligning** with the **principles** of the **Great Dao/Way**,
to **verify** the **domain of the numinous and luminous**.
When the **Dao/Way of spirit** is **unobstructed**,
then **commands** and **orders** are **issued**.

**Heaven and Earth** are **boundless**,
**human affairs** are **endless**,
each **fulfilling** its **kind**—
when one **observes** their **plans**,
one **knows** the **termination** of **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness**,
**success** and **failure**.

**Heaven and Earth** endure **longevity** and **duration**,
thus they are **boundless**.
**Human affairs** generate **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness** in **sequence**,
thus they are **endless**.
**Heaven and Earth** **achieve** **completion** through the **sun and moon** never **transgressing**,
and **mountains and valleys** never **shifting**,
while **human affairs** **achieve** **completion** through **long preservation** of **primordial **virtue/power** and **prosperity**,
and **verifying** the **fulfillment** of their **destiny**.

Thus, when one **observes** the **gain or loss** of their **plans**,
the **termination** of **auspiciousness**, **inauspiciousness**, **success**, and **failure** can all be **known**.

**Turning roundness**—
sometimes it **turns** to **auspiciousness**,
sometimes it **turns** to **inauspiciousness**.
The **sage**, through the **Dao/Way**, **foreknows** **life and death**,
and thus **knows** to **turn roundness** and **follow squareness**.

Since **auspiciousness** and **inauspiciousness** have no **fixed standard**,
one **selects** **categories** and **turns roundness**.
Yet the **sage**, through **sitting-forgetting** and **abandoning mirrors**,
**embodies** **harmony** with the **Dao/Way**,
and thus **foreknows** where **life and death** reside,
only then **turning roundness** and **following squareness**,
**discarding inauspiciousness** and **following auspiciousness**.

**Squareness** refers to where **life and death** reside.
**Roundness** is for **harmonizing speech**,
**squareness** is for **arranging affairs**,
**transformation** is for **observing plans**,
and **interacting with others** is for **observing intentions** of **advance and retreat**.

**Roundness** **flows** and **adapts** without **exhaustion**,
thus it can **harmonize** the **speech** of **others**.
**Squareness** **divides** and **fixes** its **positions**,
thus it can **arrange** **affairs** of **action**.
**Transformation** **converts** **calamity** into **blessing**,
thus it can **observe** the **gain or loss** of **plans**.
**Interacting with others** **aligns** with **human nature**,
thus it can **observe** the **intentions** of **advance and retreat**,
and **matters of right and wrong**.

All these **meetings** are then **summarized** as **essential conclusions**,
to **connect** their **discourses**.

This refers to the **four above**—
when their **meetings** and **transformations** are **seen**,
then their **principles** and **essentials** are **summarized** and **concluded**,
and the **discourses** of **emotion and deception** can be **fully connected**.

**Diminishing and Perceiving** follow the **method of the numinous**.

**Laozi** said: **"Block its perceiving."**
**River-Up Master** said: **"Perceiving is the eye."**
**Zhuangzi** said: **"The heart has an eye."**
Thus, **perceiving** refers to **discerning principles** with the **heart’s eye**.

**Diminishing** refers to **suppressing other thoughts** and **focusing** the **heart** to **perceive**.

**Perceiving** can **know gain and loss**,
**action** can **know rest and response**,
thus the **method of diminishing and perceiving** follows the **numinous**.

**Diminishing and perceiving** are the **critical moments** of **peril**.
The **principles of peril**—
the **subtle stirrings** of **omen**—
cannot be **seen** without the **heart’s eye**.

Thus it is said:
**"Diminishing and perceiving"** are the **sequels to peril**.
**Affairs** have their **natural occurrences**,
**things** have their **successes and failures**,
and the **stirrings of peril** range from **subtle to manifest**.
If one does not **adapt emotions** and **distance the heart**,
**knowing omens** and **penetrating mysteries**,
then one cannot **know** before **omens appear**,
or **discern** before **forms take shape**.

If **winds and waves** **seethe** in **hidden terror**,
and **perilous moments** **erupt** in **secrecy**,
then even the **vastness of rivers and seas** becomes a **dried-up stream**,
and a **single sigh’s accumulation** piles into **mountains**.
If one does not **plan at the beginning**,
even **regret** has **nowhere to turn**.

Thus it is said: **"It cannot be neglected."**

Therefore, the **sage** **waits idly** with **non-action** for the **virtuous**,
speaking of **discerning words** in **alignment** with **affairs**.

The **sage** is **diligent** in **seeking the worthy**,
**meticulous** in **assigning tasks**.
Thus, **upright and at ease**, he **waits idly** with **non-action** for the **virtuous**.

When the **worthy arrive**,
they **unfold** and **perform** with **speech**.
Thus it is said: **"Discerning words."**
Again, **testing clearly** with **deeds**,
thus it is said: **"In alignment with affairs."**

**Perceiving** is **knowing**,
**diminishing** is **acting**.
Using the **heart’s eye**, one can **know**.
Suppressing other thoughts, one can **act**.

When **diminishing** is **applied** to **speech**,
if **things** are **unacceptable**,
the **sage** does not **craft arguments**.

Speaking of **diminishing** and its **discourse**,
and the **things** to which it is **applied**,
if **principles** are **not universally valid**,
the **sage** does not **generate words** to **debate**.

Thus, the **wise** do not **lose others’ words** through **their own speech**,
so **words** are **unburdened** and the **heart** is **unstrained**,
**resolve** is **unconfused** and **intent** is **unerring**.

The **wise**, when **hearing disputes** among **common folk**,
**gather** the **speech** of **cutters of grass and carriers of firewood**.
Though **elaborately reasoned**,
**all things** do not **explain themselves**.

Thus, they do not **abandon others’ words** because of their **own abilities**.
Since there are **many words**,
**speech** is **appropriate** and **unburdened**,
returning to **trust the hearts** of **many**,
so the **heart** is **sincere** and **unfeigned**.
When the **heart** is **sincere** and **speech** is **appropriate**,
how could **resolve** and **intent** be **confused**?

When **difficulties and ease** are **judged**,
then **plans** are **made**.
**Natural principles** are taken as **substance**.
**Affairs** are **lost** and then **life** is **planned**,
**constants** are **changed** and then **calculations** **arise**.

Thus, when the **heart** **judges** the **junctions** of **difficulty and ease**,
then **plans** are **made**.
If **plans** **lose** the **Natural Way**,
then **affairs** **fail** and **achievements** **crumble**.

Thus, **lines** **follow** the **Natural Way**,
taking it as the **substance** for **planning**.

**Roundness** does not **act**,
**squareness** does not **stop**—
this is called **great achievement**.

**Benefiting** and **diminishing** are all **crafted in speech** to **debate** their **gain or loss**.

The **subtlety of planning** lies in its ability
to **convert calamity into blessing**,
to **achieve success** from **failure**,
and to **pursue** the **other** to **complete oneself**.

If the **other** uses **roundness** in **planning**,
my **orders** **do not proceed**.
If the **other** uses **squareness** in **planning**,
my **orders** **do not halt**.

Yet **roundness proceeds** and **squareness stops**—
this is the **constant principle**.
When my **plans** are **launched**,
the **other** **loses its constant**—
how could this not be **great achievement**?

As for **planning’s gains and losses**,
all are **crafted in speech** to **debate** their **merits**.

Using the **authority** to **divide threats** and **scatter influence**,
to **reveal perceiving**—
when **peril’s mechanisms** are **dangerous**, this is its **sequence**.

What enables one to **divide threats** and **scatter influence**
is the **function** of the **heart’s eye**.
When the **heart’s eye** is **clear**,
the **threats of perilous mechanisms** can be **known**.

Once known, then one can arrange it accordingly.
Thus, those skilled in diminishing *yú* [perceiving] are like
unleashing water from a thousand-*rèn* [fathom] dam,
rolling round boulders down a ten-thousand-*rèn* gorge.
Yet those who can execute this—
their form and circumstances leave no alternative.

Speaking of those skilled in curbing deliberation to focus the *heart’s eye*,
they perceive events clearly, grasp principles distinctly,
their intent follows order without doubt,
their resolve is mighty yet unobstructed—
like controlling water or rolling stones,
who could withstand their command?

**Holding the Pivot.**
The Pivot—
residing centrally to govern the outer,
dwelling near to control the distant,
mastering movement—
is the essence of turning.

Thus, the celestial North Star is called the Celestial Pivot,
the turning hinge of a door is called the Door Pivot.
Therefore, to *hold the Pivot*
is to wield the handle of motion to govern things.

*Holding the Pivot* means:
spring generates, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores—
the natural order of Heaven.
The four seasons move naturally without contrivance—
this is what makes it the *constant*.

Do not forcibly disrupt or reverse it;
those who do, though they succeed, must fail.
What Heaven’s principles naturally embrace,
if left undisturbed and in harmony,
the four seasons proceed, all things flourish.
Yet if one disrupts the seasons, defies the *qi* and climate,
even success turns to ruin—what of those who fail?

Yuan Liang said:
All beings with *qi* rejoice when obeyed,
rage when defied—
how much more so Heaven, sovereign over all things,
when it is defied?

Thus, the sovereign too has the Celestial Pivot of generation, nurturing, completion, and storage.
The sovereign follows Heaven’s movement,
so too does the sovereign have the Celestial Pivot.
Yet its generation, nurturing, completion, and storage
are the unfolding of Heaven’s *dao*—
the proper order of human affairs,
no different in essence.

Yet still, do not forcibly disrupt or reverse it.
To do so, though one flourishes, must decline—
this is the grand framework of Heaven’s *dao* and the sovereign’s rule.
To disrupt Heaven’s course, to reverse human propriety—
this is inversion.

Thus it is said:
If not *yi* [rightness], what is the *Dao*?

This section on *holding the Pivot* is too brief,
its principles not fully expounded—
perhaps the text is incomplete or lost.

**Central Thread.**
The Central Thread—
originating from within, extending outward through the heart,
rooted in mending what is external.

Thus it is said: *Central Thread.*
The *Central Thread* means:
reviving the desperate, aiding the urgent,
applying aid to those who can speak,
the virtuous saving things while the constrained do not forget gratitude.
*Reviving*—to uplift;
*Trending*—to turn toward.
When things are desperate and urgent,
one must uplift and turn to protect them—
this is their aid.
And it lies with those who can speak,
those of profound virtue.

If they can rescue the constrained,
the desperate will forever harbor gratitude.
Those who can speak—
their kind are benevolent and widely generous.
*Kind*—of the same class.
Those who can speak resolve disputes, save crises,
yet do not lose their virtuous nature,
while broadly extending kindness.

Those who practice virtue act in accordance with the *Dao*.
To say those who practice virtue act rightly—
their deeds never stray from the *Dao*.

Yet to rescue the constrained is to nurture the petty.
The petty, when constrained, can be made governable.
In times of shifting circumstances,
the scholar may:
sometimes avert disaster through strategic retreat,
sometimes strike down those who harm the virtuous,
sometimes break virtue to assert dominance,
sometimes suppress the constrained to form crime,
sometimes mournfully uphold goodness,
sometimes rise from ruin to establish oneself.

*Strategic retreat*—when war looms, turning to avoid destruction.
The scholar may have cause to avert such calamity.
*Strike down those who harm the virtuous*—
the petty’s way is slander without end,
so those who can speak often suffer slaughter.
*Break virtue to assert dominance*—
destroying cultural refinement, glorifying war.
*Suppress the constrained to form crime*—
when one’s merit is unrecognized, they are falsely ensnared.
*Mournfully uphold goodness*—
when the world is chaotic, without order,
the virtuous cling to death-defying integrity,
their true hearts untainted—
as the pine and cypress endure only in winter’s severity.

*Rise from ruin to establish oneself*—
when Heaven does not repent disaster,
danger and ruin follow in succession,
the noble, though impoverished, remain uncorrupted,
and ultimately establish themselves—
as did Guan Zhong.

Thus, the *Dao* values governing others,
not being governed by others.
To govern others is to grasp authority;
to be governed by others is to lose one’s life.
It is noble to have surplus power to govern others,
not noble to lack defense and be governed by others.

Hence:
observe form to discern appearance,
mirror the body to perceive countenance,
listen to tone to harmonize sound,
unravel enmity through gaps,
weave and sever words,
consolidate the heart to uphold *yi* [rightness].

This summarizes the overview;
the details follow below.

The *Classic* records events,
counting the *Dao*’s transformations—
its essence lies in *holding the Pivot* and the *Central Thread*.

This summarizes the *Classic*’s meaning of *holding the Pivot* and the *Central Thread*,
saying the *Classic*’s records merely enumerate the *Dao*’s shifts.
As for the key to adaptability,
it lies in *holding the Pivot* and the *Central Thread*.

*Observe form to discern appearance, mirror the body to perceive countenance*—
this is the *yáo* [stems] generating them.
Seeing another’s form and mirroring their body,
one knows their appearance—
this is divination through *yáo* and *guà* [hexagrams].
One can influence appearance and countenance to discern them.
This means those without principle
can be influenced by appearance and countenance to be divined.

Yet those with principle—
their eyes do not gaze at what is improper,
their ears do not listen to deceit,
their speech is grounded in the *Odes* and *Documents*,
their conduct is not perverse or licentious,
they embody the *Dao* in form,
listen with propriety in appearance,
their demeanor is dignified, their color serene—
they cannot be discerned through appearance or countenance.
Thus, their emotions are concealed,
their intentions sealed,
and they depart unseen.

Those with principle act with unwavering rectitude,
their actions are never perverse or licentious,
and later flourish,
their radiance ever renewed.
Even with the tongues of deceitful scholars,
there is no way to expose them.
Thus, their emotions remain hidden,
their intentions sealed and stored away.

Hearing voices and harmonizing sounds—
when *qi* and tone differ,
favor and response do not align.

Thus, *shang* and *jiao* are not paired,
*zheng* and *yu* do not combine.
*Shang* is metal, *jiao* wood,
*zheng* fire, *yu* water—
each in turn restrains and consumes the other,
their natures and *qi* discordant,
so they do not harmonize.

Only *gong* can master the four tones.
*Gong* is earth, earth governs the four seasons.
From these four seasons all things arise,
thus *gong* is master of the four tones.

When sounds are not harmonized,
they bring neither sorrow nor blame.
Those who scatter injury and ugliness with sound
must speak what offends the ear.
Scattered injury and ugliness—
these are the discordant tones.
When *qi* and sound are not in harmony,
they clash with what is proper,
so it is said their clash offends the ear.

Even with virtuous conduct and great renown,
they cannot pair like *bìmù* fish or *héyì* birds,
mutually relying on one another.
This is because their *qi* does not align,
their tones are not attuned.

Who can make two seek response
without sharing the same *qi*?

To resolve enmity and fill deficiencies—
this means resolving the weak and feeble’s grudges.
The executioner is the deficient one,
the strong are the deficient.
The art of persuasion is like drawing a bow:
the high are lowered, the low are raised.
Thus, the weak and feeble become enemies,
and are resolved.
The strong are the deficient,
and are filled.

Once the deficient are filled,
the victorious exalt their deeds,
magnify their power.
The filled and magnified—
their deeds are exalted,
their power magnified.

The weak lament their failures,
grieve their lowliness,
spread their names in shame,
bring dishonor to their lineage.
The weak, when lamented,
are moved to double their strength,
to die in service.

If there is no extreme might,
no overwhelming force,
then all may be coerced and united.
Though they are the deficient,
they lack neither strength nor mastery.
Thus, with military might,
they are compelled to submit and unite.

To linger after departure—
this means prolonging one’s striking words,
leaving room for further thought.
*Ji*—to bind—
to bind the words of those who have gone,
so that later reflection aligns with them.

Thus, those who are sincere and trustworthy
are praised for their conduct,
their resolve strengthened.
Their deeds are said to be both enduring and repayable,
their meeting marked by joy.
To order them to think again after departure,
praise their noble conduct,
strengthen their resolve,
so they do not grow slack.
These noble deeds—
their virtue is constant,
their repayments assured.
Their meeting is harmonious,
and they are filled with joy.

Using others’ minor virtues as proof
to bind the past,
clarifying doubts with sincerity before departing.
Having praised their conduct and strengthened their resolve,
then using others who nearly match them as proof,
to bind the past intentions,
and to clarify one’s own sincere doubts.
Thus, when departing,
they will think of you and not forget.

To retreat with words—
this means observing their flaws.
The art of retreat with words
is to observe their shortcomings.
Thus, speech is bound to have flaws,
and their flaws are recorded for verification.
Speech cannot be without flaws,
once their flaws are known,
they are remembered for verification.

Act with taboos,
demonstrate timely prohibitions.
Having observed their flaws,
use taboos to move them,
demonstrate prohibitions in season,
so they harbor fear.
Then bind them with sincerity to calm their hearts,
conceal their words and withdraw.

When their words were once advantageous but are now withdrawn,
their gratitude and awe will be deep.

Do not reveal your limitations before many.
Having concealed your words,
warn them: *"Do not, before many, reveal what you cannot do."*

To gather the heart—
when encountering those who love learning and rely on skill,
praise their distant reputation.
To gather their hearts,
seeing they love learning and rely on skill,
create a reputation for them,
so that near and far know of it.

The method of verification—
startle them with the strange,
so their hearts attach to you.
Having created their reputation,
then verify their reliance,
and with the strange startle them.
Thus, their hearts will attach to you.

To emulate them—
verify past chaos,
return sincerity to them.
Their hearts already attached,
then emulate them before others,
verify them with past sages,
then rectify their past actions,
saying: *"This is why I act thus—
my sincerity is for them."*

To encounter those ensnared by lust and wine—
use music to move them,
saying they will surely die,
that their days are few.
To gather the hearts of the foolish,
seeing those ensnared by lust and wine,
music can persuade.
And with excess in wine and lust,
lead them to the brink of death,
saying their days are few.
With these worrisome matters,
move them.

Delight them with what they have not seen,
so they may finally observe the vast and boundless fate,
and meet again later.

Again, delight them with music—
things they have never seen,
so that, in the end, they may observe what is boundless.
Yet, how can they be led astray by wine and lust?

If they can take pleasure in this,
then their life and fate will flow boundlessly and without end,
and they will meet again in eternal years.

The foolish cannot be swayed by the Dao/Way—
thus, music is used to capture their hearts.

Those who uphold **righteousness** (*yì*)—
**righteousness** means what is fitting.
To explore the heart is to probe within,
to harmonize with others.
Exploring the heart means attaining their essence,
guiding from without to within,
for all things have their natural inclinations and follow accordingly.
Once their hearts are known,
then the essence is deeply attained.
With their hearts deeply understood,
one can guide from without to within.
If the inner is controlled by me,
then what matter cannot be accomplished?
Thus, all things have their proper place,
none failing to follow as intended.

Hence, the petty (*xiǎorén*) compare themselves to the virtuous,
using **deviant arts** (*zuǒdào*) to manipulate them,
even to the point of ruining families and seizing states.
The petty, through probing the heart,
compare themselves to the virtuous,
using **deviant arts** to wield power.
All matters not of **public virtue** (*gōngzhéng*) are called petty.
They invert the Dao/Way and disrupt the norms,
harm the virtuous and attack the good.
Their methods are **deviant** (*zuǒ*), their opposition is **public** (*gōng*).
A hundred blessings become chaos,
ten thousand affairs fall into disarray,
families are shattered, states are lost—
is this not fitting?

Only the virtuous and wise can guard their families with **righteousness** (*yì*)
and guard their states with the Dao/Way.
The sage values the subtle and wondrous Dao/Way,
for it can transform peril into safety,
rescue the lost and bring them to preservation.

The Dao/Way—
this refers to the **central path** (*zhōngjīng*) of the Dao/Way.
