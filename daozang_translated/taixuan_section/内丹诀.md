**Preface to Chen Master’s Inner Elixir Formula**

The Master’s name was Pu, styled Chongyong. He lived during the late Tang and early Five Dynasties period. Amid the chaos of the Five Dynasties, he withdrew from the world and entered Shu, concealing himself in Mount Dafeng of Qingcheng. There, he received the Dao from Master Zhongli and shared the same teacher as Lü Dongbin.

The Master possessed extraordinary talent and lofty virtue, accumulating years of practice—now unknown to be how many centuries old. At times, he appeared in the world, though his nature was unpredictable, delighting in song and wine.

During the *Wuwu* year of the Yuanfeng era (1078), he traveled to the Southern Capital. Zhang Fangping, the Duke of Songcheng, honored his advanced age and transmitted to him the art of *qi*-absorption, extending his lifespan by a twelve-year cycle. The Master lingered in the Southern Capital for no less than half a year. He carried an earthen jar without a bottom, wandering through the markets, few recognizing him. An old rustic from Huainan, however, revered and believed in him, even becoming his disciple.

Moved by the man’s utmost sincerity, the Master bestowed upon him the *Inner Elixir Formula*, which was then recorded.

The Master’s *Inner Elixir Formula* directly points to the Mysterious Pass, achieving the Dao through nine transformations. Each transformation begins with a brief song, followed by verses set to the tune of *Wang Jiangnan*, so that later learners of the Dao beyond the world may readily understand.

Composed by Chen Pu, styled Chongyong.

**First Transformation Song**

**First Transformation Song**

The work of the first transformation resembles a precious pearl—
Heaven’s true water, One,
concealed within the gallbladder.
Yin and yang harmonize,
descending as the elixir,
shaped like a single dewdrop.

Mountains, rivers, and the cosmos pierce the numinous body.
Man arises from the father’s essence and mother’s blood,
their union forming the physical frame;
the elixir descends when heart-fire and kidney-water unite,
their qi intermingling.
As the elixir descends,
the spirit roams beyond the mundane,
yin and yang in perfect harmony,
so profound as to forget the form.
Heaven and earth, the four directions, the ten thousand things—
all lie within this body,
while this body dwells beyond heaven and earth.
Only this single point of radiance is perceived,
bright as the sun—
this is the elixir’s descent.

Beneath the red lotus leaf lies the elixir cave—
beneath the tongue, two apertures:
the left connects to the heart,
the right to the gallbladder.
True qi flows through them,
communing with the numinous.
Thus, when the body is unwell,
the fluid beneath the tongue dries,
for true qi is depleted.
At the first transformation’s outset,
seal the two apertures with the tongue,
preventing true qi from leaking outward,
so the numinous water may flow.
Crimson water courses through nine distinct signs.
The crimson water—fluid of the nine transformations’ beginning—
each ninth day, take nine subtle breaths,
each breath eight or nine times.
Naturally, the fluid will flow,
arising from the tongue
to irrigate the lower storehouse—
these are the nine signs.

*To the tune of* **Wang Jiangnan**
The Central Yellow Treasure must be sought within the gallbladder...

The Heavenly One generates qi, called the Central Yellow. This qi is stored in the gallbladder, serving as the root and origin of life and nature. Its flavor is bitter—just as the roots and stems of flowers and trees, though seemingly devoid of sensation, also bear a bitter taste—thus we know that without the generative qi, the myriad things cannot come to life. The medicine of the internal elixir must first seal the two apertures beneath the tongue, inwardly connecting to the generative qi within the gallbladder. When it reaches the space between the throat and tongue, a faint bitterness arises—this is the generative qi flowing freely. Only then may one seek the numinous to form the elixir.

The Spring Emperor’s decree stirs all things to life; only when the myriad things receive the qi of spring do they flourish. If one can circulate the qi of the gallbladder, the internal elixir will be accomplished. Heaven and Earth lie beneath our knees, and the hundred vessels flow freely. As the generative qi ascends, the mouth perceives bitterness; yang and yin harmonize greatly, and the spirit dwells beyond the heavens. Then the four seas and all under heaven seem as if beneath our knees, the vast qi fills heaven and earth, the hundred vessels course unimpeded, and the myriad apertures open wide—this is the descent of the internal elixir.

To enact transformation, draw the dual fires from left and right. At the outset of practice, first seal the two apertures beneath the tongue to prevent qi from leaking outward. The qi from the left and right apertures ascends inwardly: the left contributes to the left Greater Yang, entering the right side of the brain; the right passes through the brain to the crown, reaching the Mud Pill Palace, where they merge into one. Descending the twelve-storied tower of the throat, they enter the heart meridian, then pass into the gallbladder, surging open its aperture. The generative qi within the gallbladder ascends, following the heart and gallbladder meridians to penetrate the tongue’s apertures, causing the tongue to taste bitterness—this is the generative qi flowing freely, heralding the descent of the elixir.

The vast qi soars, filling the cosmos; the bitter mist wafts upward through the twelve-storied tower. Once the gallbladder’s aperture opens, the generative qi rises gently, ascending the twelve-storied tower to enter beneath the tongue, filling the mouth with bitterness—this is the sign of the generative qi flowing freely. Husband and wife gradually conspire together. When the generative qi flows freely, yin and yang harmonize greatly, and heart and kidney unite—thus they gradually conspire.

**Oral Instructions:**
At the outset of practice, one must first regulate the five viscera with diet, avoiding hunger or overindulgence. The mind-field must be tranquil, free from worry or sorrow—only then may one enter the Dao. Always at the end of the second watch, the beginning of the third, first wash and rinse, then burn incense in a quiet chamber. Sit cross-legged, close the eyes, and gather the spirit. Wait until the breath is even, then curl the tongue upward to seal the two apertures at its root. Hold the breath, and gradually perceive two channels of qi from the base of the molars, passing through the Greater Yang meridians to the crown, reaching the Mud Pill Palace—this counts as one cycle. Then open the eyes briefly, close them again to gather the spirit, and repeat the tongue-curling. When the qi reaches the Mud Pill Palace, stop. Perform this three times each night. After several nights, or ten days, or half a month, gradually feel the qi reach the Mud Pill Palace, then flow into the brain, descending the twelve-storied tower, passing the spine’s junction, threading the tailbone to ascend, entering the heart and penetrating the gallbladder. A gentle warmth arises in the chest, and the mind feels harmonious and at ease—this is the descent of true qi.

After practicing thus for several more nights, gradually feel the qi reach the heart, then a subtle warmth, or a slight stirring of qi at the heart’s center, followed by a warm current. It ascends from the heart, passing the twelve-storied tower to enter beneath the tongue, and the mouth gradually tastes bitterness—this is the Central Yellow’s qi emerging from the gallbladder. Yin and yang harmonize greatly, signaling the imminent descent of the elixir. Thereafter, at the start of each night’s practice, have someone stand outside the door to prevent people, cats, dogs, or other disturbances, lest they suddenly startle you.

When performing the three cycles each night, place a small table before you. If, during the circulation of qi, you feel the body gradually expand and the spirit soar, you may perceive your dwelling, the city, and all under heaven as if contained within your body. The body above feels as vast as heaven, below as boundless as earth; hands and feet seem to vanish. Quickly press your hands on the table, close your eyes, and perceive only a luminous orb at the heart’s center, round as the sun. Suddenly it falls—this is the descent of the elixir.

After the elixir descends, do not open your eyes immediately. Gradually gather the spirit and return it to the four limbs. Hands and feet resume their usual state, though they may feel slightly numb. Remain composed for some time, then open your eyes and drink ginseng broth before sleeping. The next day, eat congee and rest for one or two days—this completes the descent of the elixir. Once the elixir has descended, the hundred diseases vanish, and no suffering from illness or misfortune remains.

**Song of the Second Transformation:**
At the second transformation, yang is completed and yin begins to accumulate. At the outset of the second transformation, it is like a woman two months pregnant—the elixir’s initial descent forms from the essence of the true. After the elixir descends, when the second transformation meets the ninth day, one must nurture yang; when the third transformation meets the sixth day, nurture yin—this is the work of embracing and nourishing.

The heart’s light and the kidney’s fluid correspond to ding and ren. The heart belongs to fire, which is yin, matching the southern ding fire—ding is the yin of fire. The kidney belongs to water, which is yang, matching the northern ren water—ren is the yang of water. At the second transformation, nurture yang, so the heart’s light stirs below; at the third transformation, nurture yin, so the kidney’s fluid rises above. True water and true fire unite above and below, corresponding to ding and ren, embracing and nourishing the true elixir to accomplish the work of transformation.

The divine pearl dashes like lightning to the Northern Sea. When the elixir first descends, it is nurtured within the heart’s network, cultivated by true fire to quicken the elixir. Once the first transformation is complete, the true elixir suddenly flows down from the heart’s network, stored in the cinnabar field, and nurtured by true water—this is the work of the second transformation.

From time to time, the numinous light illumines the purple depths. After the elixir is stored in the cinnabar field, its qi gradually matures. Suddenly, in a quiet chamber, a divine light shines from the eyes, appearing like a golden orb—this is the elixir’s light.

"Gazing at the River South"
The mysterious pearl descends as elixir, its cavern in the Central Palace—
The mysterious pearl is the true elixir; at the first transformation’s beginning, it is stored in the heart’s network, hence called the Central Palace.

The nine pulses harmonize with the repeated ninefold count—
After the elixir descends, whenever nine days pass, one closes the breath. Nine pulses form one cycle, and nine cycles of nine—eighty-one breaths—complete the repeated ninefold count.

Crimson waves suddenly surge to the east of the Great Yang—
When the nine-by-nine work is complete, the true elixir’s yang is full. Suddenly, it flows down from the heart into the cinnabar field, stored in the Water Mansion to nourish its yin—this is the eastern sea of Great Yang.

Heart and kidneys first interflow—
Initially, the elixir descends and is stored in the heart to nurture true fire; at the second transformation, it returns to the Kidney Palace to nurture true water. Thus, yin and yang achieve great harmony and interflow.

Encountering six brings repeated sixfold yin work—
When six arrives, one closes the breath in sixfold counts for one cycle, and six cycles of six—thirty-six breaths—form one round to nourish yin.

Fire from the Sea Gate ascends to the Emperor’s Throne—
The Sea Gate is the cinnabar field, the Kidney Mansion. When the true elixir is stored within the cinnabar field and the yang count is full, at every noon, the spirit-fire from the cinnabar field rises as hot qi to reach the heart above.
The Emperor’s Throne is the heart.

Water from the Lotus Pond aids Lord Ding—
The Lotus Pond is the tongue. When the six-by-six yin count is complete, the divine water of the Flower Pool beneath the tongue flows down to irrigate the heart’s network, nourishing the elixir’s qi.
Ding is the fire of the heart.

Purple lightning pierces the intricate depths—
When the true elixir’s qi is full, divine light at times shines from the face and eyes.
At midnight, in seated meditation, one inwardly observes the five viscera and six bowels, seeing clearly within and without, directly witnessing the mysterious pearl nurtured in the cinnabar field.

Oral Instructions:
After the elixir descends and the first transformation is complete, whenever the ninth, nineteenth, or twenty-ninth day arrives—these three ninefold days—at high noon, in a quiet chamber, close the door, sit upright, cross the legs, close the eyes, and knock the teeth nine times. When spirit is settled and qi harmonized, then close the breath.
Each closure lasts eight or nine breaths as one cycle, then open the eyes.
After a long while, close the breath again as before, eight or nine breaths per cycle.
At first, close once or twice; as practice grows familiar, close four or five times. With further mastery, close nine times.
Continue thus until the inner fire’s timing is fully ripe, resonating with heaven and earth, regardless of distance.
Suddenly, upon the ninth closure, warmth arises in the heart, the four limbs feel harmonious and at ease, and the spirit stirs.
A stream of hot qi flows down into the cinnabar field—this is the inner elixir entering the cinnabar field, marking the completion of the second transformation.
After this, one no longer practices the ninefold breath count.

Song of the Third Transformation:
"For the third transformation, move yang to enter the left palace..."

With the second transformation’s elixir complete, it is stored within the cinnabar field, awaiting the sixfold movement of yin to nurture the true yin qi. Once the inner yin’s count is fulfilled and flows in harmony with heaven and earth, the true elixir suddenly streams from the cinnabar field into the left flank. The four limbs perspire, expelling the corpse qi, and thus the third transformation’s work is achieved. From this point onward, the three corpse spirits are no more.

The灵珠’s embryonic hue gradually turns crimson—
The *lingzhu* is the inner elixir. Upon the third transformation’s completion, yang qi becomes abundant, and even urine and saliva take on a pinkish tint, reflecting the pure yang essence. When the elixir’s radiance shines within, one perceives a luminous pearl like a wheel of fire beneath the left flank.

The divine body nurtures fire to manifest form—
After the third transformation, with yang qi now sufficient, at each month’s end, one uses the left hand to stroke the crown while drawing breath to stir the elixir fire, ceasing only when the five viscera grow warm—this is called *nurturing fire* to circulate the elixir. Thereafter, within the cinnabar field, a presence gradually becomes perceptible, moving with each inhalation. Thus it is said: *manifesting form*.

Heavenly music hastens the work of creation—
The harmony of heaven resounds above the nine skies, evoking sounds like celestial instruments in unison, called *heavenly music*. The nine orifices of man do not hear it. Yet after the third transformation, with the nine orifices sharpened, the sound of heavenly music is heard day and night.

*Wang Jiang Nan*:
Hair falls as the elixir,
Yang circulates to the left—
After the third transformation, with yang qi abundant, the body’s hair naturally sheds, driven away by the surging yang toxin.
The embryo’s hue reddens as yin recedes—
The inner elixir’s color deepens to red. With the third transformation’s work complete and inner yang’s count fulfilled, yang prevails, causing the yin turtle to shrink, even the intestines and stomach to contract slightly. Within a month, there are no more than ten instances of bowel movements or urination, and one attains the rank of earth immortal, achieving the Dao of the leakless.

The passage of years strengthens the firmness of Qian—
The hexagram *Qian* consists of six unbroken lines, all pure yang. When the third transformation’s yang count is fulfilled, the body mirrors *Qian*, becoming pure yang.
Nurture fire at the center—
Stroke the crown while drawing breath to cultivate the true fire within.
Manifest form, the five peaks discern subtle radiance—
With the third transformation’s elixir formed, though the five peaks are not yet complete, its movements resemble a three- or four-inch infant, not yet fully distinct.
Its emergence is slow, its form still small—
The sacred embryo takes shape, the spirit dwelling within, emerging with form like a newborn. In moments of quiet sitting and breath-holding, it often appears on the face, playing within a square *zhang*. Yet as yang qi is only now sufficient and yin has not been nurtured, the sacred embryo possesses a soul but lacks a corporeal soul, so its emergence is slow and its form still small.

At dawn and dusk, heavenly music plays the reed pipes—
With the seven orifices sharpened, the immortal melody is ever heard.
One constantly drinks the jade flask’s nectar—
The blossoming pool’s spring, the sweet dew’s water, is ever sipped.

Oral Instructions:
After the elixir enters the left flank, the third transformation’s work is complete.

On the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-sixth days of each month—these three days—at midnight, after washing and rinsing, enter a quiet chamber. Sit upright with legs crossed, knock the teeth nine times, gather the spirit and settle the qi, then close the eyes and draw breath inward. Six breath-holds constitute one cycle; then open the eyes, rest a while, and close them again to draw six breaths for the second cycle. Proceed thus for six cycles, and the practice is complete. By the twenty-sixth day of the month, three full cycles will have been accomplished. On the last night of the month, at the third watch of midnight, return to the quiet chamber as before, sit with eyes closed and legs crossed. First, use the left hand to rub the crown of the head and the right hand to rub the *weilu* (the base of the spine), turning with the sun seventy-seven times—forty-nine rotations. While rubbing, hold the breath firmly; when the count is complete, rest briefly, then resume when the qi has settled. Repeat this three times, and naturally the qi of heart and kidney will merge at the central diaphragm, stirring the elixir qi to fill the five viscera. Within the five organs, a heat like fire will be felt—this is the sign of nurturing the fire.

After this practice, on one of the three six-day nights or at the month’s end, one may suddenly feel the elixir within the left flank stir beneath the ribs, perhaps with a faint sound. A stream of hot qi will traverse the cinnabar field and enter beneath the right flank, its heat like fire, shaking for a long while before settling—this completes the fourth transformation’s work. Thereafter, the repeated sixfold count is no longer observed.

**Song of the Fourth Transformation**
The fourth transformation moves yin into the right gate—
Left pertains to yang, right to yin; the fourth transformation’s sign is the inner elixir’s left-right correspondence with the inner yin count. From this point, inner yin and yang are both fulfilled.
The sacred embryo’s numinous work births the immortal visage—
The third transformation nurtures yang, giving the sacred embryo its *hun*; the fourth nurtures yin, giving it its *po*. When the elixir reaches the fourth transformation, the sacred embryo’s *hun* and *po* are both perfected, and the five peaks’ spirits merge with one’s inner form, producing the true body of the emergent spirit.
A halo of light fills the seat, the spirit unbound—
After the fourth transformation, with yin and yang qi sufficient, sitting in quiet repose, the elixir’s divine radiance emerges from the crown of the head like a full moon encircling the body. The spirit roams within and without, coming and going freely. Seated in the chamber, one may perceive fortune and misfortune a thousand *li* away—this is the accomplishment of wondrous function.
Dancing and playing, it departs and returns at will—
The spirit’s comings and goings are unimpeded, following its own inclination.

To the Tune of *Wang Jiangnan*

The elixir moves to the right,
In the fourth revolution, yin is cultivated.
The work of the fourth revolution nurtures inner yin,
The elixir rests in the right flank, signifying yin.

When the sixth day arrives, close the gate of yang qi—
The nose is the heavenly aperture, the passage of qi belonging to yang;
The mouth is the earthly aperture, the passage of qi belonging to yin.
On the nights of the third and sixth [days], seal the nose’s breath,
Cutting off its coming and going.
Thus yang qi descends within, filling the five viscera—
This is using yang to nourish yin.

The Jade Pass’s spring permeates, uniting *ding* and *ren*.
Sealing the nose’s breath, the Flowery Pond’s waters brim,
Trickling down the heart’s network.
Water and fire intermingle within;
Heart qi descends, kidney qi ascends,
*Ding* and *ren* unite to nurture the sacred embryo.

The turtle plays, rising and sinking at will—
When yin and yang’s measures are complete,
The embryo in the right flank,
Now ascending, now descending,
Sways with the qi’s movement,
Like a turtle in water, drifting and diving as it pleases.

At times, it comes and goes without hindrance,
Piercing others’ hearts—
When the sacred embryo’s spirit is sufficient,
Its comings and goings are unimpeded.
At dawn, it roams in the western lands;
At dusk, it enters the eastern capital.
Without leaving the chamber, one sits and surveys the realm.
As for the minds of others,
One’s spirit may commune with theirs,
Discerning their intentions—
This is called "piercing others’ hearts,"
The penetration of others’ minds.

Playful, the spirit’s constant emergence from the face—
When the sacred embryo is perfected,
The infant comes and goes between the brows,
Roaming and playing within the four seas,
Manifesting the natural wonder of spiritual power.

A halo of light encircles, spanning a thousand *xun*—
The inner elixir’s radiance envelops the body,
Its form like the moon.

Neither cold nor heat can encroach.

**Oral Instructions**
After the elixir enters the right flank,
Cultivate the work of the fourth revolution.
Whenever encountering the sixth, sixteenth, or twenty-sixth day of the month,
At midnight, the hour of *zi*,
After washing and rinsing,
Enter a quiet chamber.
Close the eyes, cross the legs,
Knock the teeth thirty-six times,
Gather the spirit, settle the qi,
And seal the nose’s breath.
Though the nose’s breath is sealed,
Do not force it as in previous days.
Let there be no breath of coming or going within the nose,
Perfectly still and unmoving.
Wait until true qi fills within,
The elixir’s qi pierces the tongue’s aperture,
The Flowery Pond’s fluids well up, filling the mouth,
Nearly overflowing—
Then gently swallow them, guiding them to the heart.
When the divine water reaches the heart,
It stirs the divine fire;
The five viscera grow warm,
The whole body sweats,
The four limbs relax—
This is one cycle.
On each of the third and sixth nights,
Perform this three times and then stop.
This is the time for divine water and divine fire
To bathe and nurture the sacred embryo.

After this,
Suddenly, in the midst of practice,
The inner elixir from the right flank
Rumbles like thunder,
A stream of hot qi flows into the elixir field.
Firelight shoots from the nose—
This is the inner elixir returning to the elixir field,
Completing the fifth revolution.
From this point onward,
No longer practice sealing the gate of yang breath.

**Song of the Fifth Revolution**
The fifth revolution completes the transformations of yin and yang—
The third revolution nurtures inner yang,
The fourth revolution nurtures inner yin.
By the fifth revolution, the measures of inner and outer yin and yang are complete,
The work of transformation is done,
The sacred embryo is nurtured,
And spiritual power is free.

The infant, a foot long, plays with solar essence—
After the fifth revolution,
The inner elixir’s sacred embryo,
Having nurtured its numinous body,
Grows over a foot in length.
From this point, one absorbs the sun’s essence
To nourish outer yang,
Seizing the transformative power of heaven and earth.

Waking, one roams the four seas; sleeping, one knows one’s place—
Ordinary people, lacking inner cultivation,
Scatter their spirit and essence,
With no place to return.
By day, their spirit dwells in the heart;
By night, their spirit leaves the body.
When they fall asleep,
Their spirit has no guard,
They forget their body,
And know not where they are.
Following the *hun* and chasing the *po*,
They enter dark realms,
Gathering with ghosts.
In dreams, they see all things.
When the four great elements suddenly dissolve,
Their spirit follows the ghosts,
Receiving rebirth according to their fortune.
Heaven and hell are not of their choosing—
This is because their spirit does not recognize its own body,
Drifting with the waves.

Those who attain the Dao,
Having perfected the inner elixir,
Dwell their spirit in the elixir,
Their numinous body free.
By day, their spirit roams;
By night, their spirit settles.
When they sleep,
Their spirit sees their body,
And no thing can tempt it.
Thus the *hun* and *po* lie hidden,
A hundred evils cannot intrude.
No more dreams or sleep—
They depart from life and death,
Coming and going as they please.
Their spirit’s comings and goings are unfathomable,
Thus the elixir classics say, "The true person has no dreams,"
Referring to this.

Coming and going, they wander effortlessly.

The pearl from the right,
A bolt of lightning enters the cinnabar city.
After four revolutions, the work is complete,
Yin and yang’s numbers fulfilled.
The inner elixir’s mystic pearl
Suddenly from the right flank—
A stream of true fire
Flies into the cinnabar field.
Its sound like thunder,
Its nose’s light like flame.
This is when the pearl’s inner yin and inner yang are both full,
Returning to the cinnabar field
To complete the fifth revolution’s position.

Within the sacred embryo, the infant grows a foot long,
The true person perfected within the holy womb,
Exiting and entering through the crown gate,
Over a foot in length.

At times, meeting the ninefold numbers, they gather yang essence.
The third revolution nurtures inner yang,
The fourth nurtures inner yin.
Thus yin and yang are both full,
The elixir returns to the cinnabar field,
The work of the fifth revolution complete—
They seize heaven and earth’s creative power,
Gathering the sun’s essence to nourish their outer yang.
The path of cultivation,
From inner to outer,
Follows this natural order.
Therefore, after the fifth revolution,
Within a month’s time,
On the days of the three nines,
They gather the sun’s essence
To nourish the sacred embryo.

Fire arises within water.
The method of practice:
Seeking fire through water,
Drawing yang through yin.
Water and fire in harmony,
Yin and yang in great accord—
Thus fire arises within water.

Burning the Ghost Mountain,
The purple palace stands towering.
Ordinary people accumulate yin qi below the cinnabar field,
Called the Ghost Mountain.
When the elixir completes the fifth revolution,
Inner and outer fire ignite,
Burning away the Ghost Mountain,
The entire body pure yang.
The yin ghost’s mountain consumed,
The yang spirit’s palace established—
Thus the mountain burns, and the ghost’s talisman is no more.

Wandering at will through the seas of the world,
Sleeping like a whale on the desert sands,
Moving in harmony with the seasons.
After the fifth revolution,
The work of creation is complete,
Joining virtue with heaven and earth,
Bright as the sun and moon.
Transformations flow with time—
Thus they move in harmony with it.

Oral Instructions:
When the inner elixir returns to the cinnabar field,
The work of the fifth revolution complete,
The numbers of inner yin and yang fulfilled,
Then gather outer yin and yang
To perfect the great Dao.
Whenever encountering the ninth, nineteenth, or twenty-ninth day of the month—
The three ninefold days—
At high noon,
Face south, cross your legs,
Close your eyes, and sit facing the sun.
Wait for the qi to settle,
Close your nostrils, and halt your breath,
So that true yang does not leak,
Filling the interior.
The inner true fire communicates with the outer true fire,
And you will feel your entire body above and below
Glowing red and radiant.
After sitting for one or two moments,
Gradually, a stream of true water from the cinnabar field,
A cold qi, rises to penetrate the heart,
Like a sphere of crystal
Resting above it.
Then open your eyes and release your breath,
Inhaling the sun’s qi through your nose,
Eighty-one breaths in all,
Drawing it into the heart.
Once the sun’s qi reaches the heart,
It clashes with the true water.
After half the breaths,
You will gradually feel the qi stir in your heart,
The inner elixir in the cinnabar field
Like a leaping fish—
This is the great harmony of yin and yang.
Stop at eighty-one breaths.
Practice this for three years to complete the work.
When the three-year count is full,
Cease gathering the sun’s essence
And instead gather the moon’s radiance.

The Sixth Revolution Song:
At the sixth revolution, the spirit is whole, playing with the moon’s radiance.
When the elixir reaches the sixth revolution,
Inner and outer yin and yang are both full,
The sacred embryo’s spirit complete.
The true person and the inner body become one.
On every full moon night,
They gather the moon’s essence and splendor
To accumulate true yin—
Thus they play with the moon’s radiance.

Transforming the embryo, the hun and po’s shadows recede.
Transforming the embryo:
The ordinary womb becomes the sacred womb.
At the fifth revolution, true yang is complete,
The hun transforms into spirit.
At the sixth revolution, true yin is complete,
The po transforms into qi.
With hun and po within and without,
They wander at noon without shadow.
From this point on,
Even ghosts and spirits cannot see them,
And the yin realm is unfathomable—
This is the true immortal’s path,
The shadow receding into obscurity.

Yang cinnabar replaces the bones, yin dissolves the flesh.
The ordinary person’s impure bones,
Yin and yang unclean,
Cannot ascend.
The perfected Daoist,
After the elixir completes the fourth revolution,
By the fifth revolution,
Gathers the sun’s essence into the cinnabar field,
Coagulating it into yang cinnabar.
After a year of gathering the sun’s essence,
The yang cinnabar within is pure,
Entering the marrow,
Replacing the ordinary bones
And generating immortal bones.
They will feel at night
Sweat like white cream—
This is the ordinary bones dissolving with the sweat.
Stop at eighty-one breaths.
Thus it is said: yang cinnabar replaces the bones.
After the fifth revolution replaces the bones,
By the sixth revolution,
They gather the moon’s radiance into the cinnabar field,
Coagulating it into yin powder.
After a year of gathering the moon’s radiance,
The yin powder within transforms,
Entering the flesh,
Replacing the ordinary flesh
To nourish the immortal skin.
They will feel in their urine and stool
Purple blood constantly expelled—
This is the ordinary flesh silently dissolving,
Immortal flesh growing.
Thus it is said: yin dissolves the flesh.

Replaced entirely, like jade freed of flaws.
Jade with flaws
Cannot become true jade.
People with ordinary flesh and impure bones
Cannot become true persons.
After the sixth revolution,
They replace their ordinary bones with immortal bones,
Shed their ordinary flesh to grow immortal flesh.
Replaced entirely, without flaw,
Their spirit and clarity become one.

*Looking at the River South*:
The sun’s essence full,
The yin po transforms, formless.
At the sixth revolution, yin and yang’s numbers complete,
Hun and po inwardly transformed,
The body formless—
Thus they ascend the true person’s path.

On every full moon, open the northern door.
After the sixth revolution,
On every full moon’s fifteenth night,
They circulate northern kidney water to meet southern heart fire,
So that inner and outer water and fire harmonize,
Coagulating yin powder,
Flowing in accord with heaven and earth’s creative power
To nurture the sacred embryo.

The spirit turtle drinks from the azure jade’s chill.
The spirit turtle—
The turtle within kidney water.
The sea turtle, unknown to others—
This is gathering the moon’s essence and splendor
Into the palace of spirit water,
Where the spirit turtle drinks the yin powder.

Born within the northern sea,
How could the form and po remain?

At noon, no shadow remains.
Yang sand glows crimson; yin powder bears a faint azure hue.
The essence of the sun coalesces—this is yang’s radiance;
The essence of the moon coalesces—this is yin’s splendor.
Its crimson hue mirrors the sun;
Its pale tint mirrors the moon.
Powder refines the flesh; sand transforms the bones.
The mortal embryo is wholly exchanged for the sacred embryo’s numinosity.
The hun merges with spirit; the po merges with qi.
In purity, they become one—
Form and spirit both wondrous,
In perfect unity with the Dao.

They ascend like shooting stars.
For those who cultivate the Dao,
If they preserve their spirit but fail to transform their form,
The body becomes a burden:
When the spirit departs, the body remains unmoved;
When the corpse dissolves, the form does not depart.
After six revolutions of the elixir,
The mortal form is entirely transmuted into immortal substance—
Form and spirit both wondrous.
Where the spirit directs, the form follows,
Rising through the nine heavens,
Swift as a star.

**Oral Instructions:**
When the elixir completes six revolutions,
Gather the moon’s radiance.
On every full moon’s fifteenth night,
At midnight’s zi hour,
Bathe and rinse, then sit facing the moon.
Close your eyes, cross your legs,
Regulate your breath through the nose,
And seal your mouth,
Cutting off the flow of breath through mouth and nose,
So that true qi does not leak outward.
Within, true qi fills the six viscera.
The true yin of the kidneys and the essence of the great yin
Are inwardly and outwardly absorbed,
And yin qi circulates freely.
You will feel your entire body gleam like crystal,
Limpid and luminous.
After a moment or two,
The true water of the kidneys stirs the fire of the heart.
A thread of fiery qi from the heart’s spirit
Descends into the cinnabar field,
Like a wheel of flame resting in a lapis lazuli dish.
Then gently open your eyes, release your breath,
And through your nose, facing the moon,
Draw in the moon’s qi,
Absorbing sixty-four breaths before stopping.
After half the breaths are taken,
The moon’s true yin excites the true fire in the cinnabar field.
Water and fire intermingle,
Like boiling water—
The four limbs sweat,
The hundred vessels relax and flow,
Until the sixty-fourth breath is complete.
Practice this for two years,
And the work will be accomplished,
Preparing you to enter the seventh revolution.

**Song of the Seventh Revolution:**
At seven revolutions, the body soars, weightless—
The immortal form, light and pure,
Naturally ascends.
The numinous light, breath sealed, fills the elixir’s city.
The inner elixir refines form and spirit,
So the entire body becomes the city that houses the elixir.
When the elixir reaches seven revolutions,
Inner and outer yin and yang harmonize.
One must seal the breath for a thousand mornings
To fulfill the wondrous Dao’s work.
After a thousand mornings of fasting, the spirit fire is born.
When the elixir completes seven revolutions,
And the breath is sealed for a thousand days,
Yin and yang achieve great harmony.
When the thousand days are fulfilled,
Spirit and qi unite,
The five viscera are renewed,
And inner and outer become pure and one.
The moon’s light shines through the six viscera;
True fire illuminates the five organs.
The worms in the viscera and stomach
Are transformed into water.
From this point, the intestines and stomach are full,
No longer taking in the food of smoke and fire.
Hunger is sated with immortal fruits;
Thirst is quenched with jade nectar.
The kun gate opens wide to bathe the sea whale.
After the inner elixir is wholly transformed,
The yin form dissolves entirely,
Leaving but one aperture—
Called the kun gate,
Symbolizing yin.
Whenever the divine elixir’s fire grows strong,
On the days of the three nines,
Enter the water,
Circulate the elixir pearl,
And let it emerge from the kun gate.
Breathe, play in the water,
And frolic freely.
After an hour or two,
Return the elixir to its chamber,
Nestling it in the elixir cave
To regulate the fire’s intensity.

**Looking Over the River South:**
The form penetrates the sun—
At seven revolutions, it soars at will.
After seven revolutions,
Form and spirit are both wondrous,
Inner organs and outer form
All become vessels of immortality.
Roaming at noon,
Form and shadow are luminous,
The hue like red jade.
Ascending and soaring through the void,
Moving freely as they please.
Secluded in deep cliffs, they sit in meditation,
Breath without coming or going—
Spirit congeals.
The work of the seventh revolution
Lies in harmonizing inner and outer,
So the radiance of the sun and moon without
Merges with the water and fire of heart and kidneys.
Yin and yang circulate,
Spirit and qi unite.
Secluded in mountain valleys,
They sit in meditation for a hundred days,
Sealing the breath through the nose
To cut off the flow of respiration.
Spirit and qi surge in harmony,
Congealing in great stillness.
The five viscera are inwardly full,
No longer consuming the world’s dust.
They realize the Dao of carefree wandering.
Fasting yields wonders,
Able to generate spirit fire,
Returning to the origin—qi pure and clear.
When the nine signs appear, bathe and open the earth gate.
Whenever the spirit fire grows excessive,
And the five viscera burn hot,
On the days of the nine,
Enter the water to bathe the true elixir.
It shines like a wheel of fire,
Emerging from the earth gate—
Thus the earth gate opens.
Drawing fire from the moon, seeking ice from the sun.
The moon symbolizes yin;
Spirit fire is the utmost yang.
The earth gate is yin’s aperture.
Guiding the yang light,
It emerges from the yin cavity of the earth gate—
Thus drawing fire from the moon.
The sun symbolizes yang;
Spirit water is the utmost yin.
The tongue’s aperture is yang’s cavity,
Through which spirit water flows,
Emerging from the yang cavity of the tongue—
Thus seeking ice from the sun.
The five organs are renewed.
At five revolutions, the bones are transformed;
At six, the flesh;
At seven, the five viscera.
The five organs are the five viscera—
Thus the five organs are renewed.

**Oral Instructions:**
When the elixir reaches seven revolutions,
One must leave the dusty world behind,
Entering deep mountains,
Sitting in meditation within cliffs.
Seal the breath, congeal the spirit,
Cutting off the flow of breath through mouth and nose,
So that true yin and true yang merge within the abdomen,
Seizing the creative power of heaven and earth,
Returning it to the four limbs.
After a thousand days,
The five viscera are wholly transformed,
And the fetal qi becomes immortal organs.
You will feel the aperture at the crown open,
Releasing red and black qi—
This is the dispersal of fetal qi.
When the thousand days are fulfilled,
The crown’s aperture closes—
The fetal qi is exhausted,
And the work of the seventh revolution is complete.

After this, the five viscera become solid and no longer accept food cooked over fire and smoke. Should the elixir-fire within the viscera flare up at times, causing fire to issue from the nostrils, one must enter water and seal the breath through the nose. Then the cinnabar pearl and spirit-fire will emerge from the yin gate, floating upon the water’s surface like a cow playing in yellow mire. Only when the divine water beneath the tongue flows like a spring will the elixir-fire naturally subside. Inhale the cinnabar pearl back into the Gate of Earth, and proceed until the eighth revolution, when the Earth Belt is accomplished. With no more fire-toxin, there will be no further need for bathing.

**Song of the Eighth Revolution:**
The eighth revolution returns to the hanging Earth Belt,
As the infant lies within the mother’s womb, enveloped in the placenta.
The settled qi cannot escape and suffers no loss—
For the infant’s navel holds an umbilical cord that connects to its mouth,
Allowing the breath to flow ceaselessly in and out.
This is the natural fetal breathing, hence no harm comes to it.

Once the heart-elixir completes the eighth revolution,
An umbilical cord grows again within the navel,
Just like that of an infant,
Restoring the original Way of beginnings.
Thus it is called *returning to the hanging Earth Belt.*

Circulating fetal breathing to nourish the infant,
The Perfected attains the Earth Belt and moves the qi of the celestial cycle,
Thus achieving longevity.

At times, fire arises to scorch the elixir-cave—
Plunge deep into the cool spring to play with the red turtle.
The red radiance is the cinnabar pearl.
After the eighth revolution, the inner refinement of true fire
Eliminates the affliction of heat-toxin.
Whenever fire flares, one must hold the Earth Belt in the mouth,
Seal the breath for nine days,
And on the ninth day, true water will surge from the cinnabar field
Like a gushing spring, rising to the Twelve-Storied Tower.
The cinnabar pearl will float within this divine water,
Like a turtle sporting in the waves.

From this point onward, true fire holds no toxin,
And the affliction of elixir-heat vanishes.
Thus it is said: *plunge deep into the cool spring to play with the red turtle.*

**Looking Over the River South:**
Within and without, all is pervaded—
Only at the eighth revolution does one return to the origin.

When the elixir reaches the eighth revolution, the external form and the internal five viscera are entirely transformed. The Earth Belt regenerates, resembling the state of an infant—thus it is called *returning to the origin and restoring the primordial*.

The Earth Belt hangs long, giving birth to the Kan Gate;
Coursing through the womb-breath, it penetrates the Celestial Gate.
The Earth Belt is the umbilical cord, born within the navel and belonging to the northern Kan trigram—hence it is called *giving birth to the Kan Gate*. The Celestial Gate is the aperture of the Flowery Pond; the Earth Belt connects to the mouth, circulating the breath of the celestial cycle to regulate the fire’s timing—thus it is called *coursing through the womb-breath*.

The Dao of the Great Beginning now abides.
The Dao of the Great Beginning is the origin of heaven and earth; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, it is the inception of heaven and earth’s creation.

A single, pure body—
Within and without, it is wholly yang, without a trace of yin qi—hence it is called *a single, pure body*.

Black and red qi constantly sprays forth—
Black and red are the qi of spirit-fire; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, the breath’s coming and going issues from the nose, ever manifesting as black and red qi—thus it is said *qi constantly sprays forth*.

When the elixir-fire flares to scorch the inner realm,
Plunge deep into the cool spring to bathe the macaque.
The affliction of elixir-fire is governed by the movement of spirit-water; thus, no sign of elixir-fire remains. The elixir is the heart-pearl, and the heart resembles a monkey; bathing the elixir in spirit-water, the divine elixir floats and sinks within it—hence it is called *bathing the macaque*.

The spirit-water swallows the red turtle—
The elixir floats within the spirit-water, like a turtle swallowing water, describing its form.

**Oral Instructions:**
When the elixir completes its eighth revolution, the Earth Belt is born within the navel. If elixir-fire flares within and the five viscera grow parched and hot, immediately close the eyes and sit in repose, connecting the Earth Belt beneath the Flowery Pond to allow the breath to circulate internally, practicing the method of the celestial cycle.

After closing the breath, the true water of the cinnabar field gradually waxes like the sun and moon. By the ninth day, the spirit-water rises to the Twelve-Storied Tower, and the cinnabar pearl is immersed within it, purging all fire-toxin. Thereafter, no sign of parched heat remains. On the ninth night at the hour of zi, close the breath and draw the spirit-water into the Muddy Pellet, passing through the Spine Bridge, then returning to the cinnabar field to complete the work.

The power of creation returns to the four limbs. After a thousand days, the five viscera are entirely transformed, and the fetal qi becomes the immortal viscera. One merely senses the aperture at the crown opening, emitting black and red qi—this is the dispersal of fetal qi. When the thousand days are fulfilled, the crown’s aperture closes, the fetal qi is exhausted, and the seventh revolution’s work is complete.

From this point onward, the five viscera are firm and solid, no longer receiving grain or fire-cooked food. If at times elixir-fire flares within the five viscera and fire issues from the nostrils, enter water and seal the nasal breath. Then the cinnabar pearl and spirit-fire will emerge from the yin gate, floating upon the water’s surface like an ox playing in the yellow. Wait until the spirit-water beneath the tongue flows like a spring, whereupon the elixir-fire will naturally subside. Draw the cinnabar pearl back into the Kun Gate, and by the eighth revolution, the Earth Belt is perfected. With no fire-toxin remaining, bathing is no longer required.

**Song of the Eighth Revolution:**
At the eighth revolution, the Earth Belt hangs down to return to the origin,
Like an infant within the mother’s womb, enveloped in the fetal sac.
The stabilized qi cannot escape and suffers no loss—
For the infant’s navel holds the umbilical cord in its mouth,
The breath’s coming and going unceasing, this is natural womb-breath, hence no loss.
When the heart-elixir completes its eighth revolution,
A navel cord regenerates within the navel, resembling the infant’s form,
Restoring the Dao of the primordial origin—thus it is called *returning to the origin, the Earth Belt hangs down*.

Coursing through the womb-breath to nurture the infant—
The perfected one obtains the Earth Belt and circulates the qi of the celestial cycle, thus attaining longevity.
Whenever fire flares to scorch the elixir-cavern,
Plunge deep into the cool spring to play with the red turtle.
The red radiance is the cinnabar pearl; after the eighth revolution,
The inner refinement of true fire eliminates the affliction of heat-toxin.
Whenever fire flares, hold the Earth Belt in the mouth,
Seal the breath for nine days, and on the ninth day,
True water will surge from the cinnabar field like a gushing spring,
Rising to the Twelve-Storied Tower, the cinnabar pearl within the spirit-water,
Like a turtle sporting in the waves.
From this point onward, true fire holds no toxin,
And the affliction of elixir-heat vanishes—
Thus it is said: *plunge deep into the cool spring to play with the red turtle.*

**Looking Over the River South:**
Within and without, all is pervaded—
Only at the eighth revolution does one return to the origin.

When the elixir reaches the eighth revolution, the outer form and the inner five viscera are entirely transformed. The Earth Belt regenerates, resembling the state of an infant—thus it is called *returning to the root and restoring the origin*.

The Earth Belt hangs long, giving life to the Kan Gate;
Circling in fetal breathing, it pierces the Heavenly Gate.
The Earth Belt is the navel’s cord, born within the navel and belonging to the northern Kan trigram—hence it is called *giving life to the Kan Gate*. The Heavenly Gate is the aperture of the Flowery Pond; the Earth Belt connects to the mouth, circulating the breath of the celestial cycle to regulate the fire’s timing—thus it is called *circling in fetal breathing*.

The Dao of the Great Beginning now abides.
The Dao of the Great Beginning is the origin of heaven and earth; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, it is the first moment of heaven and earth’s creation.

A single unified body—
Within and without, it is purely yang, without a trace of yin qi—hence it is called *a single unified body*.

Black and red qi constantly sprays forth.
Black and red are the qi of spirit-fire; when the elixir completes its eighth revolution, the breath’s coming and going issues from the nose, and one constantly sees black and red qi—thus it is called *qi constantly sprays forth*.

When elixir-fire flares to scorch the inner realm,
Plunge deep into the cool spring to bathe the gibbon.
The affliction of elixir-fire is controlled by mobilizing spirit-water, leaving no sign of elixir-fire. The elixir is the heart’s pearl, and the heart resembles a gibbon—bathing the elixir in spirit-water, the divine elixir floats and sinks within the spirit-water—hence it is called *bathe the gibbon*.

The spirit-water and red turtle swallow.
The elixir floats within the spirit-water like a turtle swallowing water—this describes its form.

**Oral Instructions:**
When the elixir completes its eighth revolution, the Earth Belt arises within the navel. If elixir-fire flares internally and the five viscera grow parched and hot, immediately close the eyes and sit in repose, connecting the Earth Belt beneath the Flowery Pond to allow the breath to circulate within, practicing the method of celestial circulation.

After closing the breath, the true water of the cinnabar field gradually waxes like the sun and moon. By the ninth day, the spirit-water rises to the Twelve-Storied Tower, and the cinnabar pearl is immersed within the spirit-water, purging all fire-toxin. From this point onward, there is no further sign of parching heat. On the ninth night at the hour of *zi*, close the breath and draw the spirit-water into the Mud Pill Palace, passing through the Spine’s Bridge to return to the cinnabar field, thus completing the work.

**Song of the Nine Revolutions:**
The nine revolutions bring carefree attainment of the Dao’s fruit...

No further practice is required. With three thousand merits and deeds, one becomes a true immortal. When the nine revolutions of the elixir are complete, the three thousand deeds accumulate externally as the elixir achieves full perfection—only then may one ascend. Thus, Xu Jingsun subdued the flood dragons and thereby ascended, and Sun Simiao healed myriad illnesses before he could take flight; both first completed three thousand merits before ascending.

The Golden Elixir and Jade Tablet proclaim the imperial decree. After three thousand merits are fulfilled, the Jade Emperor bestows a decree, presenting the Golden Elixir to dispel worldly defilements. Once the Golden Elixir enters the abdomen, the Earth Belt falls away of itself, and one ascends to pay homage to the Jade Emperor, their name recorded in the immortal register.

The crane-drawn cloud chariot departs for the grotto-heavens.

**To the Tune of "Gazing at the Southern River"**
The elixir completes its nine revolutions,
Pure and unified in the primordial countenance.
When the elixir achieves its nine revolutions, it shares the age of heaven and earth;
pure and unified in the primordial, it is the origin of the Great Dao.
After the elixir is complete, form merges with the Dao,
and one’s countenance becomes that of the primordial.
Internally and externally, non-action ever embraces simplicity,
roaming freely beyond the seas and among men,
while merits and deeds accumulate like mountains.
The azure palace’s decree,
the Jade Tablet and golden ring bestowed,
serve as tokens to pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor.

Having consumed the *daogui*, one rides the feathered chariot—
the *daogui* is the Golden Elixir ingested.
Once the Golden Elixir enters the abdomen, the Earth Belt falls away,
clouds arise beneath the feet, and one rides upon feathers as a steed to approach the celestial gates.
Banners and pennants, flutes and drums pass through the heavenly barriers,
to join the ranks of immortals in audience before the Emperor.
Heavenly music welcomes, the *xiaoshao* harmonizes in concert.
**Here ends the Inner Elixir Formula.**
