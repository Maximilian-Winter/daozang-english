He commanded Xi and He to reverently observe the celestial patterns of the vast heavens, tracking the sun, moon, and stars, and respectfully imparting the seasons to the people. The cycle was set at three hundred and sixty-six days, with intercalary months to regulate the four seasons, completing a year termed a *zài*. The month of *Jiǎnyín* was established as the beginning, rightly ordering the hundred labors, so that all undertakings flourished.

*Guǐchǒu*: Emperor Yao sought to abdicate, illuminating the obscure and elevating the worthy. He first summoned Shun and tested him through manifold trials, bestowing upon him the two daughters at Guiwei, making them consorts of Yu, to observe his governance.

*Jiǎyín*. *Yǐmǎo*: Shun’s words proved his achievements sound; the Emperor, with virtue, recommended him to Heaven and invested him with rank.

*Bǐngchén*: On the first day of the first month, Shun received the mandate at the Hall of Culture. He employed the *xuanji* and *yuheng* to align the Seven Governors, offered sacrifices to the Supreme God, revered the Six Ancestries, paid homage to the mountains and rivers, and extended rites to all spirits. He gathered the Five Auspicious Signs and Five Jade Tablets, distributing them among the feudal lords. He inaugurated the Twelve Provinces, enfeoffed the Twelve Mountains, conducted seasonal inspections, harmonized the months and corrected the days, standardized the pitch-pipes, measures, and weights, refined the Five Rites, modeled punishments upon canonical laws, exiled Gonggong to Youzhou, banished Huandou to Mount Chong, banished the Sanmiao to Sanwei, and executed Gun at Mount Yu. The Four Culprits having been rectified, all under Heaven submitted. *Dīngsì*.

*Jiǎshēn. Yǐyǒu. Bǐngxū:* On the first day of the first month, Shun arrived at the Hall of Culture and was proclaimed Lord of Yu. He established his capital at Púbǎn, consulted the Four Peaks, opened the Four Gates, illuminated the Four Directions, and extended the Four Modes of Hearing. He sought counsel from the Twelve Governors, appointed the Nine Ministers: appointing Yǔ as Minister of Works, Jì as Minister of Agriculture, Xiè as Minister of Education, Gāoyáo as Minister of Justice, Chuí as Minister of Crafts, Yì as Minister of Forests, Yí as Minister of Rites, Kuí as Director of Music, and Lóng as Minister of Communications. These nine were tasked with overseeing the Hundred Offices. Every three years, their achievements were reviewed, and promotions or demotions were made based on merit, so that all undertakings coalesced.

He ordered the waters and lands of the realm, divided the Nine Provinces, Nine Mountains, Nine Rivers, and Nine Marshes, uniting them at the Four Seas. He cultivated the Six Treasuries, and when all was harmonized, the Three Soils bore fruit, and tribute was levied upon the central states.

**The Great Dao of the Universe, Volume 10, Lower Part, Complete**
**The Great Dao of the Universe, Volume 10, Upper Part, Complete**
**The Master Shao Yao of Three Rivers Composed**

**Observing Things, Chapter 51 of *The Great Dao of the Universe* (上)**

Among the vastest of things, none surpasses Heaven and Earth. Yet even they have limits.

The vastness of Heaven is exhausted by **Yin and Yang**. The vastness of Earth is exhausted by **Justness and Softness**.

When **Yin and Yang** are exhausted, the Four Seasons arise. When **Justness and Softness** are exhausted, the Four Cardinal Directions arise.

The Four Seasons and the Four Cardinal Directions are the very essence of Heaven and Earth’s vastness. None can surpass them in their magnitude.

Yet they do not rest upon vastness as their own attainment, and thus they achieve their vastness. Is this not the very sublime and sublime?

Heaven is born from **movement**, Earth from **stillness**. When one **moves** and the other **stills** are intertwined, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is fully realized.

At the beginning of **movement**, **Yang** arises. At the extreme of **movement**, **Yin** arises. When **Yin** and **Yang** intertwine, the functions of Heaven are fully realized.

At the beginning of **stillness**, **Softness** arises. At the extreme of **stillness**, **Justness** arises. When **Softness** and **Justness** intertwine, the functions of Earth are fully realized.

The greatest **movement** is called **Great Yang**. The least **movement** is called **Lesser Yang**. The greatest **stillness** is called **Great Yin**. The least **stillness** is called **Lesser Yin**.

**Great Yang** manifests as the Sun, **Great Yin** as the Moon, **Lesser Yang** as stars, **Lesser Yin** as constellations. When Sun, Moon, stars, and constellations intertwine, the form of Heaven is fully realized.

The greatest **stillness** is called **Great Softness**. The least **stillness** is called **Lesser Softness**. The greatest **movement** is called **Great Justness**. The least **movement** is called **Lesser Justness**.

**Great Softness** manifests as water, **Great Justness** as fire, **Lesser Softness** as earth, **Lesser Justness** as stone. When water, fire, earth, and stone intertwine, the form of Earth is fully realized.

The Sun brings **heat**, the Moon brings **cold**, stars bring **day**, constellations bring **night**. When **heat**, **cold**, **day**, and **night** intertwine, the transformations of Heaven are fully realized.

Water brings **rain**, fire brings **wind**, earth brings **dew**, stone brings **thunder**. When **rain**, **wind**, **dew**, and **thunder** intertwine, the changes of Earth are fully realized.

**Heat** alters the **nature** of things, **cold** alters the **feelings** of things, **day** alters the **appearance** of things, **night** alters the **essence** of things. When **nature**, **feelings**, **appearance**, and **essence** intertwine, the responses of living and growing things are fully realized.

**Rain** manifests as things that **roam**, **wind** as things that **soar**, **dew** as things that **sprout**, **thunder** as things that **root**. When **roaming**, **soaring**, **sprouting**, and **rooting** intertwine, the reactions of living and growing things are fully realized.

**Roaming**, when altered by **heat**, reveals the **nature** of roaming. When altered by **cold**, reveals the **feelings** of roaming. When altered by **day**, reveals the **appearance** of roaming. When altered by **night**, reveals the **essence** of roaming.

**Soaring**, when altered by **heat**, reveals the **nature** of soaring. When altered by **cold**, reveals the **feelings** of soaring. When altered by **day**, reveals the **appearance** of soaring. When altered by **night**, reveals the **essence** of soaring.

**Sprouting**, when altered by **heat**, reveals the **nature** of sprouting. When altered by **cold**, reveals the **feelings** of sprouting. When altered by **day**, reveals the **appearance** of sprouting. When altered by **night**, reveals the **essence** of sprouting.

**Rooting**, when altered by **heat**, reveals the **nature** of rooting. When altered by **cold**, reveals the **feelings** of rooting. When altered by **day**, reveals the **appearance** of rooting. When altered by **night**, reveals the **essence** of rooting.

**Nature**, when transformed by **rain**, reveals the **nature** of roaming. When transformed by **wind**, reveals the **nature** of soaring. When transformed by **dew**, reveals the **nature** of sprouting. When transformed by **thunder**, reveals the **nature** of rooting.

**Feelings**, when transformed by **rain**, reveals the **feelings** of roaming. When transformed by **wind**, reveals the **feelings** of soaring. When transformed by **dew**, reveals the **feelings** of sprouting. When transformed by **thunder**, reveals the **feelings** of rooting.

**Appearance**, when transformed by **rain**, reveals the **appearance** of roaming. When transformed by **wind**, reveals the **appearance** of soaring. When transformed by **dew**, reveals the **appearance** of sprouting. When transformed by **thunder**, reveals the **appearance** of rooting.

**Essence**, when transformed by **rain**, reveals the **essence** of roaming. When transformed by **wind**, reveals the **essence** of soaring. When transformed by **dew**, reveals the **essence** of sprouting. When transformed by **thunder**, reveals the **essence** of rooting.

The **nature** of roaming favors **bright hues**, the **feelings** of roaming favor **harmonious sounds**, the **appearance** of roaming favors **flowing qi**, the **essence** of roaming favors **delicious flavors**.

The **nature** of soaring favors **bright hues**, the **feelings** of soaring favor **harmonious sounds**, the **appearance** of soaring favors **flowing qi**, the **essence** of soaring favors **delicious flavors**.

The **nature** of sprouting favors **bright hues**, the **feelings** of sprouting favor **harmonious sounds**, the **appearance** of sprouting favors **flowing qi**, the **essence** of sprouting favors **delicious flavors**.

The **nature** of rooting favors **bright hues**, the **feelings** of rooting favor **harmonious sounds**, the **appearance** of rooting favors **flowing qi**, the **essence** of rooting favors **delicious flavors**.

The **nature** of roaming favors the **ear**, the **nature** of soaring favors the **eyes**, the **nature** of sprouting favors the **mouth**, the **nature** of rooting favors the **nose**.

The **feelings** of roaming favor the **ear**, the **feelings** of soaring favor the **eyes**, the **feelings** of sprouting favor the **mouth**, the **feelings** of rooting favor the **nose**.

The **appearance** of roaming favors the **ear**, the **appearance** of soaring favors the **eyes**, the **appearance** of sprouting favors the **mouth**, the **appearance** of rooting favors the **nose**.

The **essence** of roaming favors the **ear**, the **essence** of soaring favors the **eyes**, the **essence** of sprouting favors the **mouth**, the **essence** of rooting favors the **nose**.

Thus, humans are such that **heat**, **cold**, **day**, and **night** do not fail to alter them, **rain**, **wind**, **dew**, and **thunder** do not fail to transform them, **nature**, **feelings**, **appearance**, and **essence** do not fail to respond to them, and **roaming**, **soaring**, **sprouting**, and **rooting** do not fail to react to them.

Thus, the **eyes** are attuned to the **colors** of all things, the **ears** to the **sounds**, the **nose** to the **qi** of all things, and the **mouth** to their **tastes**.

How could one be more **responsive** to all things than this? It is only fitting.

The reason humans are able to be so **responsive** to all things is that their **eyes** can gather the **colors** of all things, their **ears** the **sounds**, their **noses** the **qi**, and their **mouths** the **tastes**. **Sounds**, **colors**, **qi**, and **tastes** are the **forms** of all things. **Eyes**, **ears**, **noses**, and **mouths** are the **functions** of all people.

**Forms** have no fixed **functions**; only **change** defines their **functions**. **Functions** have no fixed **forms**; only **transformation** defines their **forms**. When **forms** and **functions** interact, the Dao of humanity and all things is fully realized.

Yet, humans are also **things**, and sages are also humans. There are **things** that are one **kind** of thing, ten **kinds** of things, a hundred **kinds** of things, a thousand **kinds**, ten thousand **kinds**, a hundred million **kinds**, and a trillion **kinds** of things. A trillion-**kind** thing—is it not humanity?

There are humans who are one **kind** of human, ten **kinds**, a hundred **kinds**, a thousand **kinds**, ten thousand **kinds**, a hundred million **kinds**, and a trillion **kinds** of humans. A trillion-**kind** human—is it not the sage?

Thus, it is known that humanity is the ultimate **thing**, and the sage is the ultimate human. The ultimate **thing** is what we call the **thing** of all things. The ultimate human is what we call the **human** of all humans.

If one ultimate **thing** can embody one ultimate human, then who else but the sage?

If one claims a person is not a sage, I do not believe it. Why?

Because the sage can perceive the myriad **minds** through a single **mind**, the myriad **bodies** through a single **body**, the myriad **things** through a single **thing**, and the myriad **ages** through a single **age**. The sage can also manifest the **Will of Heaven** through **mind**, the **Words of Heaven** through **mouth**, the **Deeds of Heaven** through **hands**, and the **Affairs of Heaven** through **body**. The sage can align with **Heaven’s timing** above, harmonize with **Earth’s patterns** below, yield to **the sentiments of all things** in the middle, and exhaustively fulfill **human affairs**.

Ah! The sage is not one who merely imitates sainthood across generations. I cannot see the sage with my **eyes**. Though I cannot see the sage with my **eyes**, by examining their **mind**, observing their **actions**, exploring their **being**, and probing their **functions**, even after countless eons, I can still comprehend them through **principle**.

Someone might say to me: *"Beyond Heaven and Earth, there exists another Heaven and Earth, and all things differ from this."* Then I cannot know them. Not only can I not know them, but even the sage cannot know them.

Those who speak of **knowing** mean their **minds** have grasped it. Those who speak of **speaking** mean their **mouths** have articulated it. If even the **mind** cannot grasp it, how could the **mouth** ever truly express it?

To claim knowledge of what cannot be known is **delusive knowing**. To speak of what cannot be spoken is **delusive speech**. How could I follow such **delusive** claims and **delusive** knowing and speaking?

The *Book of Changes* says: *"Exhaust the **principles**, fulfill the **nature**, and reach the **mandate**."* What we call **principles** are the **principles** of all things. What we call **nature** is **Heaven’s nature**. What we call **mandate** is the ability to dwell within **principles**.

The only way one can dwell within **principles** is through the **Dao/Way**.

Thus, the **Dao/Way** is the fundamental foundation of **Heaven and Earth**, and **Heaven and Earth** are the fundamental foundation of all things. Observing **Heaven and Earth** to understand all things, all things become **all things**. Observing the **Dao/Way** to understand **Heaven and Earth**, **Heaven and Earth** also become **all things**.

The **Dao/Way** of the **Dao/Way** is fully realized in **Heaven**. The **Dao/Way** of **Heaven** is fully realized in **Earth**. The **Dao/Way** of **Heaven and Earth** is fully realized in all things. The **Dao/Way** of **Heaven, Earth**, and all things is fully realized in humanity.

When humanity knows the **Dao/Way** of **Heaven, Earth**, and all things—what is fully realized in humanity—only then can it exhaustively fulfill the **people**.

When **Heaven** exhaustively fulfills all **things**, it is called **Wu Tian** (the "Great Heaven"). When humanity exhaustively fulfills the **people**, it is called the **sage**.

If **Wu Tian** could differ from all **things**, then it would not be called **Wu Tian**. If the **sage** could differ from all the **people**, then it would not be called the **sage**.

Since the **people** and all **things** are the same, the **sage** is no different from **Wu Tian**.

Thus, the **sage** and **Wu Tian** share the same **Dao/Way**. If the **sage** and **Wu Tian** share the same **Dao/Way**, then the **people** and all **things** can also be said to share the same **Dao/Way**. If the **people** of one **age** and all **things** of one **age** can be said to share the same **Dao/Way**, then it is clear that the **people** and all **things** of myriad **ages** can also be said to share the same **Dao/Way**.

Both **Wu Tian**’s fulfillment of all **things** and the **sage**’s fulfillment of the **people** have their **four treasuries**. The **four treasuries** of **Wu Tian** are **spring, summer, autumn, winter**—where **yin and yang** rise and fall.

The **four treasuries** of the **sage** are the *I Ching*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Book of Songs*, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—where **ritual and music** flourish.

**Spring** is the **treasury** of **nurturing** all **things**, **summer** of **growing** them, **autumn** of **harvesting** them, and **winter** of **storing** them. The myriad **categories** of all **things** are called **ten thousand**—though it may seem as if there are **ten thousand** upon **ten thousand**, none can surpass the **four treasuries** of **Wu Tian**.

The *I Ching* is the **treasury** of **nurturing** the **people**, the *Book of Documents* of **growing** them, the *Book of Songs* of **harvesting** them, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* of **storing** them.

Though the **people** are called **ten thousand**, even if they seem **ten thousand** upon **ten thousand**, can any of them surpass the **four treasuries** of the **sage**?

The **four treasuries** of **Wu Tian** are the **seasons**. The **four treasuries** of the **sage** are the **classics**.

**Wu Tian** uses the **seasons** to bestow upon **people**, and the **sage** uses the **classics** to model **Heaven**.
How ought the affairs of **Heaven** and **people** be aligned?

In the *Observing Things* chapter (54#8), one sees that by observing **spring**, one knows where the *I Ching* is stored;
by observing **summer**, one knows where the *Book of Documents* is stored;
by observing **autumn**, one knows where the *Book of Songs* is stored;
and by observing **winter**, one knows where the *Spring and Autumn Annals* are stored.

The *I Ching*’s **Dao/Way** is called **nurturing**—**nurturing** indeed.
The *I Ching*’s **virtue/power** is called **growing**—**growing** indeed.
The *I Ching*’s **ritual and music** are called **harvesting**—**harvesting** indeed.
The *I Ching*’s **storing** is called **storing**—**storing** indeed.

The *Book of Documents*’s **Dao/Way** is called **nurturing and growing**—**nurturing and growing** indeed.
The *Book of Documents*’s **virtue/power** is called **growing**—**growing** indeed.
The *Book of Documents*’s **ritual and music** are called **growing and harvesting**—**growing and harvesting** indeed.
The *Book of Documents*’s **storing** is called **storing**—**storing** indeed.

The *Book of Songs*’s **Dao/Way** is called **harvesting and nurturing**—**harvesting and nurturing** indeed.
The *Book of Songs*’s **virtue/power** is called **harvesting and growing**—**harvesting and growing** indeed.
The *Book of Songs*’s **ritual and music** are called **harvesting**—**harvesting** indeed.
The *Book of Songs*’s **storing** is called **storing**—**storing** indeed.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals*’s **Dao/Way** is called **storing and nurturing**—**storing and nurturing** indeed.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals*’s **virtue/power** is called **storing and growing**—**storing and growing** indeed.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals*’s **ritual and music** are called **storing and harvesting**—**storing and harvesting** indeed.
The *Spring and Autumn Annals*’s **storing** is called **storing**—**storing** indeed.

**Nurturing** is the cultivation of **intent/mind** (*yì*).
**Growing** is the cultivation of **words/speech** (*yán*).
**Harvesting** is the cultivation of **symbols/figures** (*xiàng*).
**Storing** is the cultivation of **numbers/calculations** (*shù*).

**Nurturing and growing** is the cultivation of **virtue/power** (*rén*).
**Growing** is the cultivation of **ritual** (*lǐ*).
**Growing and harvesting** is the cultivation of **justice/rightness** (*yì*).
**Storing** is the cultivation of **wisdom** (*zhì*).

**Harvesting and nurturing** is the cultivation of **human nature** (*xìng*).
**Harvesting and growing** is the cultivation of **affections/emotions** (*qíng*).
**Harvesting** is the cultivation of **forms/shapes** (*xíng*).
**Storing** is the cultivation of **substance/essence** (*tǐ*).

**Storing and nurturing** is the cultivation of **sageliness** (*shèng*).
**Storing and growing** is the cultivation of **excellence** (*xián*).
**Storing and harvesting** is the cultivation of **talent** (*cái*).
**Storing** is the cultivation of **art/skill** (*shù*).

The cultivation of **intent/mind** (*yì*) is what the **Three Sovereigns** (*Sān Huáng*) are called.
The cultivation of **words/speech** (*yán*) is what the **Five Emperors** (*Wǔ Dì*) are called.
The cultivation of **symbols/figures** (*xiàng*) is what the **Three Kings** (*Sān Wáng*) are called.
The cultivation of **numbers/calculations** (*shù*) is what the **Five Hegemons** (*Wǔ Bá*) are called.

The **Three Sovereigns** shared **virtue/power** (*rén*) but differed in their **Dao/Way**.
The **Five Emperors** shared **words/speech** (*yán*) but differed in their **virtue/power** (*dé*).
The **Three Kings** shared **symbols/figures** (*xiàng*) but differed in their **exhortation** (*quàn*).
The **Five Hegemons** shared **numbers/calculations** (*shù*) but differed in their **laws/rates** (*shuài*).

Those who shared **virtue/power** (*rén*) but differed in their **Dao/Way** must have used the **Dao/Way**.
To cultivate **people** with the **Dao/Way** is to have **people** return to the **Dao/Way**, hence the veneration of **naturalness**.

**Naturalness** is the state of **non-action** (*wúwéi*) and **non-possession** (*wúyǒu*).
**Non-action** is not the absence of action, but the absence of rigid action—thus it is broad.
**Non-possession** is not the absence of possession, but the absence of rigid possession—thus it is great.

When **broad** and **great** are fully realized, yet there is no rigid action or rigid possession,
then it is the **Three Sovereigns** alone.

Thus, one who knows how to cultivate the world with the **Dao/Way** will have the world return to the **Dao/Way**.
Hence, the **sage** spoke:

*"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves;
I have no affairs, yet the people grow rich;
I love tranquility, yet the people align themselves;
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.
Is this not what is meant?"*

The **Three Sovereigns** shared **virtue/power** (*rén*) but differed in their **Dao/Way**.
The **Five Emperors** shared **ritual** (*lǐ*) but differed in their **virtue/power** (*dé*).
The **Three Kings** shared **justice/rightness** (*yì*) but differed in their **exhortation** (*quàn*).
The **Five Hegemons** shared **wisdom** (*zhì*) but differed in their **laws/rates** (*shuài*).

Those who shared **ritual** (*lǐ*) but differed in their **virtue/power** (*dé*) must have used **virtue/power**.
To teach **people** with **virtue/power** is to have **people** return to **virtue/power**, hence the veneration of **humility/letting**.

**Humility/letting** is the act of placing others before oneself.
To give the world to another without arrogance, as though one had never possessed it.
To receive the world from another without pride, as though one had always possessed it.

If one had never possessed it or had always possessed it,
then to take a single hair and give it to another would still arouse greedy and base thoughts—
how much more so when it comes to the world?

Those who know that the world belongs to the world and not to themselves—
are there not only the Five Emperors?

Thus, those who know how to govern the world through **virtue/power** (*dé*)
will have the world return to them through **virtue/power**.

Therefore, the Sage spoke:
*"Loose his robes and the world is governed."*
This is drawn from the **Heaven-Earth** (*qiánkūn*).
Is this not what is meant?

The Three Sovereigns shared **nature** (*xìng*) but differed in their **transformations** (*huà*).
The Five Emperors shared **emotion** (*qíng*) but differed in their **teachings** (*jiào*).
The Three Kings shared **form** (*xíng*) but differed in their **exhortations** (*quàn*).
The Five Hegemons shared **essence** (*tǐ*) but differed in their **laws/rates** (*shuài*).

Those who shared **form** but differed in their **exhortations** must have relied on **achievement** (*gōng*).
To exhort the people through **achievement** is for the people to return to them through **achievement**—
hence the veneration of **governance** (*zhèng*).

For **governance** (*zhèng*) is **rectification** (*zhèng*).
To rectify what is not rectified is what is meant.

The most rectifying thing in the world is to benefit the people.
The most unrectified thing in the world is to harm the people.
Those who can benefit the people with rectitude are called **Kings** (*wáng*).
Those who harm the people without rectitude are called **bandits** (*zéi*).
To remove harm with benefit—how could one abandon kingship?
To remove bandits with kingship—how could one commit regicide?

Thus, it is known that kingship is **rectification**.
Those who can rectify the world’s unrectitude through **achievement** will have the world return to them through **achievement**.

Therefore, the Sage spoke:
*"Heaven and Earth transform, and the Four Seasons are thereby completed."*
The Revolution of Tang and Wu followed Heaven and responded to the people—
is this not what is meant?

The Three Sovereigns shared **sainthood** (*shèng*) but differed in their **transformations**.
The Five Emperors shared **virtue** (*xián*) but differed in their **teachings**.
The Three Kings shared **talent** (*cái*) but differed in their **exhortations**.
The Five Hegemons shared **methods** (*shù*) but differed in their **laws/rates**.

Those who shared **methods** but differed in their **laws/rates** must have relied on **force** (*lì*).
To lead the people through **force** is for the people to return to them through **force**—
hence the veneration of **contention** (*zhēng*).

For **contention** (*zhēng*) is contention over **benefit** (*lì*).
To take **benefit** without **righteousness** (*yì*) is called contention.
Small contention is waged with words; great contention with arms.
It is contention over strength and weakness.
Just as borrowing a name is called **crookedness** (*qūzhí*).
For **name** (*míng*) is the proper designation of things and rectified affairs.
**Benefit** (*lì*) is the means to nourish and fulfill human endeavors.
Without **virtue** (*rén*) in **name**, one cannot preserve achievements.
Without **righteousness** in **benefit**, one cannot occupy merit.
If **benefit** is not used to claim merit, and **name** is not used to guard achievements,
then chaos ensues.
This is why the people must contend.

The Five Hegemons were those who borrowed empty **names** to contend for real **benefits**.
If the Emperor was insufficient, then the King; if the King was insufficient, then the Hegemon;
if the Hegemon was insufficient, then the barbarians.
If so, then the Five Hegemons were not without merit to China.
In terms of kingship, they were lacking, but they surpassed the barbarians by far.
When the Zhou moved eastward, the **virtue/power** (*dé*) and **achievements** (*gōng*) of Wen and Wu were exhausted,
yet they could still sustain twenty-four rulers, keeping the royal house from perishing like a thread,
and the barbarians dared not slaughter and harm the Central Plains—
this was due to the force of the Five Hegemons’ borrowed names.

Thus, it is known that those who lead the world through **force** will have the world return to them through **force**.

Therefore, the Sage spoke:
*"The blind can see, the lame can walk,
treading a tiger’s tail, biting men’s calamity.
The warrior serves the great lord."*
Is this not what is meant?

Now the text:

---

Now, **intent** (*yì*) is to exhaust the nature of things.
**Speech** (*yán*) is to exhaust the emotions of things.
**Symbols** (*xiàng*) are to exhaust the forms of things.
**Calculations** (*shù*) are to exhaust the substance of things.
**Beneficence** (*rén*) is to exhaust the sageliness of humankind.
**Rites** (*lǐ*) are to exhaust the excellence of humankind.
**Rightness** (*yì*) is to exhaust the talents of humankind.
**Knowledge** (*zhì*) is to exhaust the arts of humankind.

To exhaust the nature of things is called **Dao/Way**.
To exhaust the emotions of things is called **virtue/power** (*dé*).
To exhaust the forms of things is called **achievements** (*gōng*).
To exhaust the substance of things is called **force**.
To exhaust humankind’s sageliness is called **transformation** (*huà*).
To exhaust humankind’s excellence is called **teaching** (*jiào*).
To exhaust humankind’s talents is called **persuasion** (*quàn*).
To exhaust humankind’s arts is called **leadership** (*shuài*).

**Dao/Way**, **virtue/power**, **achievements**, and **force**—
these reside in the **substance** (*tǐ*).
**Transformation**, **teaching**, **persuasion**, and **leadership**—
these reside in **application** (*yòng*).

Between **substance** and **application**, there are shifts and continuations—
this is the **work** (*shìyè*) of the Sage.

Now, **shifts** (*biàn*)—
this is what Heaven generates in all things.
**Authority** (*quán*)—
this is what the Sage generates among the people.

If not generating things nor people,
how could one still call it **Authority** or **shifts**?

In the *Observation of Things* (Chapter 55, #13):
Those who excel in **transforming** the world cease only when they exhaust **Dao/Way**.
Those who excel in **teaching** the world cease only when they exhaust **virtue/power**.
Those who excel in **persuasion** the world cease only when they exhaust **achievements**.
Those who excel in **leadership** the world cease only when they exhaust **force**.

To use **Dao/Way**, **virtue/power**, **achievements**, and **force** as **transformation**—
this is called **August Sovereign** (*huáng*).
To use **Dao/Way**, **virtue/power**, **achievements**, and **force** as **teaching**—
this is called **Emperor** (*dì*).
To use **Dao/Way**, **virtue/power**, **achievements**, and **force** as **persuasion**—
this is called **King** (*wáng*).
To use **Dao/Way**, **virtue/power**, **achievements**, and **force** as **leadership**—
this is called **Hegemon** (*bó*).

To use **transformation**, **teaching**, **persuasion**, and **leadership** as **Dao/Way**—
this is called *The I Ching* (*Yì*).
To use **transformation**, **teaching**, **persuasion**, and **leadership** as **virtue/power**—
this is called *The Book of Documents* (*Shū*).
To use **transformation**, **teaching**, **persuasion**, and **leadership** as **achievements**—
this is called *The Book of Poetry* (*Shī*).
To use **transformation**, **teaching**, **persuasion**, and **leadership** as **force**—
this is called *The Spring and Autumn Annals* (*Chūnqiū*).

These four—
from the beginning of Heaven and Earth, they begin;
from the end of Heaven and Earth, they end.
Their beginning and end follow Heaven and Earth.

Now, **past and present**—
they exist within the span of Heaven and Earth,
just as morning and evening do.

To observe the present with the present,
then it is called the present.
To observe the present with the future,
then the present is also called the past.

To observe the past with the present,
then it is called the past.
To observe the past with the past itself,
then the past is also called the present.

Thus, it is known that the past is not necessarily the past,
and the present is not necessarily the present—
all depends on how one observes it.

How do we know that before ten thousand ages
and after ten thousand ages,
those who observe will not observe it differently?

If so, then **August Sovereign**, **Emperor**, **King**, and **Hegemon**—
these are the **mandates of their times** (*shì*).
*The I Ching*, *The Book of Documents*, *The Book of Poetry*, and *The Spring and Autumn Annals*—
these are the **classics of the Sage** (*jīng*).

The **mandates of their times** have their waxing and waning,
the **classics** have their adaptations and reforms.
The waxing and waning of the **mandates of their times** are fully realized—
this is the division of **substance** and **application**.
The adaptations and reforms of the **classics** are fully realized—
this is the distinction of **heart** and **trace**.

When **substance** and **application** are divided,
and **heart** and **trace** are distinguished,
the **work** of the Sage is thus complete.

Therefore, from ancient times to the present,
those who ruled the world had four kinds of **mandates**:
The first is **inherited mandate** (*zhèngmìng*),
the second is **received mandate** (*shòumìng*),
the third is **altered mandate** (*gǎimìng*),
the fourth is **usurped mandate** (*shèmìng*).

**Inherited mandate** is to follow and continue.
**Received mandate** is to follow and reform.
**Altered mandate** is to reform and continue.
**Usurped mandate** is to reform and discard.

To follow and continue—
this is the **long-lasting** and **long-lasting**.
To follow and reform—
this is the **long-lasting** and the **waning**.
To reform and continue—
this is the **waning** and the **long-lasting**.
To reform and discard—
this is the **waning** and the **waning**.

To reform and discard—
this is the **work** of a single age.
To reform and continue—
this is the **work** of ten ages.
To follow and reform—
this is the **work** of a hundred ages.
To follow and continue—
this is the **work** of a thousand ages.
To follow when possible and reform when possible—
this is the **work** of ten thousand ages.

The **work** of a single age—
what else is it but the **Dao/Way** of the Five Hegemons?
The **work** of ten ages—
what else is it but the **Dao/Way** of the Three Kings?
The **work** of a hundred ages—
what else is it but the **Dao/Way** of the Five Emperors?
The **work** of a thousand ages—
what else is it but the **Dao/Way** of the Three August Sovereigns?
The **work** of ten thousand ages—
what else is it but the **Dao/Way** of Master Zhongni?

Thus, it is known that **August Sovereign**, **Emperor**, **King**, and **Hegemon**—
these are the **mandates of their times**.
Master Zhongni—
this is the **timeless**.

Master Zhongni said:
*"The Yin followed the rites of the Xia; what was added or diminished can be understood.
The Zhou followed the rites of the Yin; what was added or diminished can be understood.
If one were to follow the Zhou, even a hundred ages could be understood.
But why stop at a hundred ages? Even ten thousand, a hundred thousand, or a million ages could be understood."*

All know Master Zhongni as Master Zhongni,
but none know how Master Zhongni became Master Zhongni.
If one does not wish to know how Master Zhongni became Master Zhongni,
then let it be.
But if one must know how Master Zhongni became Master Zhongni,
then abandon Heaven and Earth—what else could one seek?

All know Heaven and Earth as Heaven and Earth,
but none know how Heaven and Earth became Heaven and Earth.
If one does not wish to know how Heaven and Earth became Heaven and Earth,
then let it be.
But if one must know how Heaven and Earth became Heaven and Earth,
then abandon **movement** and **stillness**—what else could one seek?

Now, **movement** and **stillness**—
are these not the most wondrous of Heaven and Earth?

The **movement** and **stillness** between the two—
this is the most wondrous, most wondrous of Heaven, Earth, and Man.

Thus, it is known how Master Zhongni could exhaust the Dao of the Three Realms—
for his conduct left no trace.

Hence the saying:
*"I would wish to speak no words."*

And again:
*"What speech can Heaven have? The Four Seasons move therein, the myriad things are born therein—
is this not what is meant?"* #14

In *"Observing Things"* (Chapter 56), #15
Confucius praised the *Yijing* from Xuān and Xiǎn onward,
sequenced the *Shujing* from Yáo and Shùn onward,
edited the *Shijing* from Wén and Wǔ onward,
and compiled the *Chūnqiū* from Huán and Wén onward.

From Xuān and Xiǎn onward, he traced the Three Sovereigns.
From Yáo and Shùn onward, he revered the Five Emperors.
From Wén and Wǔ onward, he honored the Three Kings.
From Huán and Wén onward, he acknowledged the Five Hegemons.

To trace the Three Sovereigns was to value the worthy.
To revere the Five Emperors was also to value the worthy.
The Three Sovereigns valued the worthy through the **Dao**,
the Five Emperors valued the worthy through **virtue**.

To honor the Three Kings was to value kinship.
To acknowledge the Five Hegemons was also to value kinship.
The Three Kings valued kinship through **achievement**,
the Five Hegemons valued kinship through **force**.

Ah! The past has passed—
countless millions of years.
The future yet to come—
also countless millions of years.

Why so few ancestors,
yet so many descendants?

This is why Yáo and Shùn were so highly praised,
even unto Yǔ, saying:
*"Yǔ, I have no quarrel with him."*

Master Zhongni lived fifteen hundred years after Yǔ.
From now until fifteen hundred years after Master Zhongni—
though I dare not compare my **virtue** to Master Zhongni’s praise of Yáo, Shùn, and Yǔ,
how could I not dare to emulate Mèngzǐ’s praise of Master Zhongni?

Some say Master Zhongni was unfortunate in lacking a realm,
but I think otherwise.

A commoner takes a hundred *mǔ* as his realm,
a great officer takes a hundred *lǐ* as his realm,
a feudal lord takes his four borders as his realm,
the Son of Heaven takes the Four Seas as his realm,
but Master Zhongni took the ten thousand generations as his realm.

If so, then Mèngzǐ’s words—
*"Since the birth of the people, none have been like the Master"*—
are not an exaggeration.

Man cannot enrich himself;
he must await Heaven’s bestowal of wealth before he can be rich.
Man cannot noble himself;
he must await Heaven’s bestowal of nobility before he can be noble.

If so, then wealth and nobility depend on Heaven,
not on man.

Some seek and obtain,
others seek and do not obtain—
this is what depends on Heaven.

**Achievement** and **virtue** depend on man,
not on Heaven.
They can be cultivated and attained,
or neglected and lost—
this is not what depends on Heaven,
but what depends on man.

When man seeks and obtains wealth and nobility,
he seeks what can be obtained.
What cannot be obtained—
this is not what he should seek.

The ignorant, not knowing that what they obtain is obtained,
believe it is their own doing,
so they boast of it.
When they seek and do not obtain,
they blame others for not granting it,
so they resent them.

If one knows how one obtains
and how others grant,
then who in the world could be unaware of limits?

The most wealthy is the Son of Heaven,
the most noble is the Son of Heaven—
how could one presumptuously seek and obtain them?

Still, Heaven’s decree is not without accumulation of **achievement** and **conduct**.
The sage-ruler strives arduously to fulfill it,
the mediocre ruler through tyranny destroys it.

Is this Heaven?
Or is this man?

If man’s actions bring blame that cannot be escaped,
and Heaven’s calamities are invoked—
what use is expiation?

The accumulation of **achievement** and **conduct** is the common lot of the virtuous,
not something sought after.
What is sought after is called *"profiting from what is right."*

The virtuous have no leisure for such matters.

Yet there are those with fortune and those with misfortune—
only then can one speak of **decree**.

Yǔ of Xià gained the Mandate through **achievement**,
Jiè of Xià lost it through tyranny.
Tāng of Yīn gained the Mandate through **achievement**,
Zhòu of Yīn lost it through tyranny.
Wǔ of Zhōu gained the Mandate through **achievement**,
Yōu of Zhōu lost it through tyranny.

Though their times differed,
their rise and fall were the same.

Píngwáng moved eastward,
but lacked **achievement** to restore the royal cause.
Àngzhǔ fled westward,
but lacked tyranny to destroy the royal house.
His authority did not extend beyond a small state,
and the feudal lords relied on the Five Hegemons alone.

This is hardly worth mentioning.

But since no true King arose,
even with the hollow titles of Qǐ and Sòng,
who would say they differed?

In that time, the compilation of the *Chūnqiū* was fitting.

Master Zhongni revised the classics during the reign of Zhōu Píngwáng:
the *Shujing* ended with Jìn Wén Hóu,
the *Shijing* listed the songs of the feudal states,
the *Chūnqiū* began with Lǔ Yǐngōng,
and the *Yijing* concluded with the *Wèijì* hexagram.

I am not one who knows Master Zhongni,
but one who studies to be like him.

Rites, music, military campaigns, and punishments—
these originated with the Son of Heaven,
yet issued from the feudal lords.
The Son of Heaven’s authority had greatly declined.

The **virtue** and **achievement** of the Western Zhou
originated with Wén and Wǔ,
yet degenerated under Lì and Yōu.
The foundations of Wén and Wǔ were exhausted.

Thus, the Róng barbarians could humiliate the Central States.
Though the Zhou feudal lords were many,
only Jìn could repel the barbarians,
relocate the king to the eastern capital of Lòuyì,
and lead the way for the feudal lords to preserve the royal house
as the first of the Five Hegemons.

The ritual offerings of *jùchàng guīdàng* were bestowed upon him—
how could he escape his fate?

The *Zhuàn* records that Zǐgòng wished to remove the sacrificial sheep
for the New Moon announcement in Lǔ.
Confucius said:
*"Zǐgòng, you love your sheep,
but I love the rites."*

Thus, even when the name remains but the reality is lost,
it is better than when both name and reality are lost.

If the rites are abandoned but the sheep remain,
then how can later generations know there may not be those
who restore the rites?

Jìn Wén Gōng honored the king,
though he relied on a hollow title,
yet he could still compel the feudal lords to acknowledge
the Son of Heaven and dare not attack him with arms.

When the Jin [State] declined, the Qin [State] dared to destroy the Zhou [Dynasty]—
thus the words *"I love the rites"* were indeed not false.

The Duke Jing of Qi once asked Confucius about governance in a single day.
Confucius replied: *"The ruler rules, the subject serves, the father fathers, the son sons."*
The Duke said: *"Excellent! But if the ruler does not rule, the subject does not serve,
the father does not father, and the son does not son—
even if there were grains, could I eat them?"*

In that era, the feudal lords usurped the authority of the Son of Heaven,
ministers of lesser rank held sway over state affairs,
salaries were diverted from the princely houses,
and governance issued from private doors.
The Duke Jing of Qi himself could not uphold the Zhou Son of Heaven,
yet he wished his subjects to serve him—
was this not difficult?

Later, the Qi lineage was usurped by the Tian [Family].
The Tian [Family]’s hold over Qi was like the Three Families’ hold over Jin.
The Three Families’ hold over Jin was like the Five Hegemons’ hold over Zhou.

Han, Zhao, and Wei toward Jin—
they had already established their merit,
then divided its lands.
They had already humbled its lord,
then seized its state.
The Tian [Family] toward Qi—
they had already gained its salaries,
then monopolized its governance.
They had already killed its lord,
then usurped its lineage.
As for the affairs of the world,
how could there not be gradual shifts?

The warning of *"treading on frost"*—
how could one not reflect upon it?

The *Zhuàn* [Commentary] says:
*"The ruler, he goes forth.
He who can go forth over the world,
may be called a ruler."*

When the Zhou declined, the feudal lords had long ceased to pay homage to the Son of Heaven.
Yet when Chu [State] arrogantly participated in the central states’ alliances,
Zǐgōng [Confucius] only advanced his rank to that of a son.
Was this not a crude acknowledgment of usurpation?

He who conquers others by force,
others shall conquer him by force.
Wu [State] once defeated Yue [State],
yet still held a disdain for Chu [State].
When it broke Chu, it then harbored ambitions to dominate Qi [State].
Greed and aggression, disregarding virtue and righteousness,
they invaded and humiliated Qi and Jin,
treating the barbarian states as their sole concern.
Thus, they were again destroyed by Yue [State].
Yue [State] did not heed this lesson,
and later was itself destroyed by Chu [State].
Chu [State] did not heed this lesson,
and later was destroyed by Qin [State].
Qin [State] did not heed this lesson,
and later was replaced by Han [State].
How does relying on strength to oppress the weak
differ from the wolf and tiger?
This is not the conduct of a teacher of the central states’ Dao/Way and principles.

As for the state of Song [State],
its noble titles were high,
yet its power was low—
how could it not struggle?
Alliances were formed without measuring virtue,
gatherings were held without assessing strength,
yet it vied with the feudal lords across the Central Plains,
ashamed to lag behind—
was this not difficult to achieve?

Among the Zhou’s same-clan feudal lords,
only Yan [State] endured for ages.
Yan [State] occupied the distant northern lands,
far from the Central Plains.
If it did not compete with Han, Zhao, Wei, Qi, and Chu
for profit through arms or for empty titles,
then it would be sufficient to nurture its virtue,
await its time, and observe the changes among the feudal lords.

Though Qin [State] was like a wolf and tiger,
it was still not easily harmed by others.
After fifteen or sixteen years,
the affairs of the world were still uncertain.
The Central Plains’ territory measured nine thousand *lǐ*,
neither more in antiquity nor less in the present,
yet there were lineages enduring long or short,
lands vast or small—
this was due to differing strategies of attack and defense.

From the Three Dynasties onward,
Han and Tang [Dynasties] were the most flourishing.
Qin [State] stood between the Zhou and Han [Dynasties].
Qin’s rise began with Duke Mu,
its zenith with Duke Xiao,
and its end with the First Emperor.
They originated from the Western Barbarians,
settled at Qíshān,
then moved to Xiányáng.
Their armies ravaged the land,
blood flowed across the world,
they swallowed the Four Seas,
and transformed the customs of past and present.

Though they could not compare in virtue to the Three Dynasties,
they were not on the same level as Jin or Sui [Dynasties].
Was the brevity of their lineage
not due to their excessive use of law and their many killings?

This is why Confucius arranged the *Shūjīng* [Classic of Documents],
ending with the *"Qínshì"* [Oath of Qin]—
his intent was not also profound?

He who loves life,
shall be its follower.
He who loves killing,
shall be its follower.
The Zhou’s love of life was rooted in righteousness,
the Han’s love of life was also rooted in righteousness.
The Qin’s love of killing was rooted in profit,
the Chu’s love of killing was also rooted in profit.
The Zhou’s love of life was rooted in righteousness,
yet the Han did not even reach that level.
The Qin’s love of killing was rooted in profit,
yet Chu surpassed it in excess.

The Dao/Way of Heaven, human nature—
what choice does it make between Zhou, Qin, Han, and Chu?
It chooses only between good and evil.

Thus, goodness is without rival in the world,
yet the world follows it in common.
Evil is also without rival in the world,
yet the world follows it in common.
The Dao/Way of Heaven, human nature—
what choice does it make between Zhou, Qin, Han, and Chu?
It chooses only between good and evil.

**Volume 11, *Huángjí Jīngshì* – *Observing Things* (Chapter 57)**

In ancient times, when Confucius spoke to Yáo and Shùn, he said: *"Let the ruler govern with ease, and the world will be well-ordered."* When he spoke to Tāng and Wǔ, he said: *"Follow the Dao of Heaven and respond to the people."* These words encompass the fundamental principle by which ancient and modern emperors received their Mandate.

Yáo passed the throne to Shùn through virtue; Shùn passed it to Yǔ through merit. Passing through virtue makes one an *Emperor*; passing through merit also makes one an Emperor. Yet, if virtue falls one degree, it becomes merit.

Tāng overthrew Jié by banishing him; Wǔ overthrew Zhòu by killing him. Banishment makes one a *King*; killing also makes one a King. Yet, if banishment falls one degree, it becomes killing.

Thus, it is known that times wax and wane, affairs shift and transform—ancient sages and later sages do not follow a single path.

Heaven and humanity are interdependent, like form and substance. Heaven has yin and yang; humanity has perversity and rectitude. The origin of perversity and rectitude lies in what the ruler favors. If the ruler favors virtue, the people act with rectitude. If the ruler favors flattery, the people act with perversity. The source of perversity and rectitude is thus inherent.

Even with a sage ruler above, there will always be petty men—it is difficult for them to remain petty. Even with a mediocre ruler above, there will always be virtuous men—it is difficult for them to remain virtuous.

In all antiquity, no sage ruler’s era was as flourishing as that of Emperor Yáo. Why were there so many virtuous men? It was not that petty men did not exist—rather, it was difficult for them to act petty, so virtuous men thrived. Thus, though the Four Evildoers existed, they could not unleash their wickedness.

In all antiquity, no mediocre ruler’s era was as degenerate as that of King Zhòu. Why were there so many petty men? It was not that virtuous men did not exist—rather, it was difficult for them to act virtuous, so petty men thrived. Thus, though the Three Renunciants existed, they could not fulfill their goodness.

Thus, it is known that when a ruler selects ministers or ministers select a ruler, this is a matter of human choice. When a ruler obtains worthy ministers or ministers obtain a worthy ruler, this is not merely a matter of human choice—it is determined by Heaven.

Wisdom and folly are inherent in human nature; profit and harm are the common inclinations of the people. Yú Shùn was molded by the riverbank, Fù Yuè labored beneath the cliffs. Though all under Heaven knew of their virtue, the officials did not recommend them because of profit and harm. Alas! When profit and harm cluster within, and spears and halberds bristle without, how can one know of Yú Shùn’s sagehood or Fù Yuè’s worth?

The riverbank was not the place to abdicate; the cliffs were not the way to seek office. Once, they were among the hundred million below; now, they are among the hundred million above. How vast the distance!

Yet they must speak thus—because of the value of reputation.

The *Yì* says:
*"Kǎn: Trustworthy in heart, prosperous. Action has dignity. Steadfast and upright, venturing boldly—advance and you will achieve success. Though perilous, there is no blame, for you trust in yourself."*

Thus, Yī Yín understood that in antiquity, there were those who suffered from reputation exceeding reality. Some were fortunate, others unfortunate—even sages could not always overcome this.

Yī Yín served as Prime Minister, stationed at the *Zéchéng* post. If he had avoided the reputation of banishing a ruler, could it be said he lacked loyalty? Then the affairs of the world would be lost, and how could he have fulfilled the supreme loyalty of guiding the heir and completing the ruler’s mission?

Alas! If entrusted to an unworthy man, within three years, what would become of the heir? Then the affairs of the world would be lost, and how could there even be an Yī Yín?

*"Kǎn: Trustworthy in heart, prosperous."* Is this not close to the truth?

The *Yì* also says:
*"Yóu: Greatly fortunate. Do not doubt; friends gather like hairpins. Firm and vigorous, full of anticipation—when action meets response, all doubts vanish, for you strengthen yourself."*

Thus, the Duke of Zhōu understood this.

Thus, it is known that sages cannot prevent slander, but they can endure it.

The Duke of Zhou, though dwelling in the remote region of *Zǒngyǐ* (總已), held a position of great responsibility. If he had avoided the reputation of destroying his kin, could it be said he lacked filial virtue? Then the affairs of the world would be lost, and how could he have safeguarded the heir, fulfilling the supreme filial virtue of completing the ruler’s legacy?

Alas! If entrusted to an unworthy man, within seven years, what would become of the heir? Then the affairs of the world would also be lost, and how could there even have been a Duke of Zhou?

*"Yóu: Greatly fortunate. Do not doubt; friends gather like hairpins."* Is this not close to the truth?

When the world is about to be well-governed, people will surely value conduct. When the world is about to descend into chaos, people will surely value words. Valuing conduct, the spirit of earnest sincerity will prevail. Valuing words, the spirit of deceit and cunning will prevail. When the world is about to be well-governed, people will surely uphold righteousness. When the world is about to descend into chaos, people will surely uphold self-interest. Upholding righteousness, the spirit of humility and yielding will prevail. Upholding self-interest, the spirit of plunder and contention will prevail.

The Three Sovereigns (三王) were those who valued conduct. The Five Hegemons (五伯) were those who valued words. Those who valued conduct must also uphold righteousness. Those who valued words must also pursue self-interest. The distance between righteousness and self-interest—how vast it is!

Thus, it is known that words spoken from the mouth are not as powerful as deeds shown in the body. Deeds shown in the body are not as powerful as intentions held in the heart. Words spoken from the mouth, people can hear. Deeds shown in the body, people can see. Intentions held in the heart, the divine can perceive. Human cleverness is still not to be deceived, how much more so the divine cleverness!

Thus, it is known that having no guilt in words is easier than having no guilt in deeds. Having no guilt in deeds is easier than having no guilt in the heart. To avoid speaking wrongly is easy, but to avoid acting wrongly is difficult. To avoid acting wrongly is easy, but to avoid having wrong intentions is difficult. If one has already no wrong intentions, what difficulty remains?

Alas! How can one find a man without wrong intentions to speak with him from the heart?

Therefore, it is understood that sages could stand in a place of no guilt because they excelled in cultivating their hearts.

In the *"Observing Things"* section, number fifty-eight, Master Zhòngní (仲尼) said:
*"The *Sháo* (韶) was perfect in beauty, and also perfect in virtue. The *Wǔ* (武) was perfect in beauty, but not perfect in virtue."*

He also said:
*"Guan Zhong served Duke Huan of Qi, became the hegemon among the feudal lords, and righted the world once. The people even to this day benefit from his blessings. Without Guan Zhong, I would have been shaved-headed and worn my clothes with the left lapel open (被发左衽)."*

Thus, it is known that King Wu of Zhou, though not as virtuous and perfect as Shun, could still right the world’s upside-down state, and thus was inferior to Shun by only one degree. Duke Huan of Qi, though not as harmonious with Heaven and responsive to the people as King Wu, could still become the hegemon among the feudal lords and right the world once, and thus was far superior to the Di tribes.

Comparing King Wu to Shun, he could not avoid guilt, but compared to Duke Huan, he could not avoid merit. Comparing Duke Huan to the Di tribes, he could not avoid merit, but compared to King Wu, he could not avoid guilt. The Han dynasty thus should have been established between King Wu and Duke Huan.

At that time, even though the people of the world were weary of the Qin dynasty’s cruelty, though there were ten Liu Ji (劉季) or a hundred Si Fang (子房), how could they sway hearts that were not yet ready?

Moreover, the times of ancient and modern eras differ, but the people’s love for life and hatred of death do not differ. From ancient times to now, the number of those killed has never been as great as in the Qin dynasty. How could the world not be weary of it?

The multitude of killings does not necessarily require blades—it means that the people of the world have no path to life, and how much more so when blades are used to kill many of them?

The Qin dynasty’s Second Emperor (二世) was a ruler of ten thousand chariots (万乘), yet he sought to be the people’s leader and could not attain it. Liu Ji of the Han dynasty (刘季) was but an ordinary man (匹夫), yet he was freed to become the sovereign and could not stop.

Though the ruler of ten thousand chariots and the ordinary man are vastly different, sometimes the latter replaces the former—because the world’s benefits and harms are differently balanced.

The Way of Heaven is not to bring misfortune to the ruler of ten thousand chariots and bless the ordinary man—it means to bring misfortune to the unrighteous and bless the righteous.

Human nature is not to abandon the ruler of ten thousand chariots and follow the ordinary man—it means to abandon the unrighteous and follow the righteous.

Though the ruler of ten thousand chariots and the ordinary man are vastly different, sometimes the latter replaces the former—because the world’s benefits and harms are differently balanced.

The sun has set, the moon is in its wane, and the stars cannot help but grow dim. It is not that the stars are dim, but that they struggle to shine in their own right. Those who can shine in their own right—are they not rare?

The Han and Tang dynasties having founded their enterprises, Lü (吕) and Wǔ (武) having monopolized power, the ministers could not help but be rare. It is not that the ministers are rare, but that they struggle to be loyal in their own right. Those who can be loyal in their own right—are they not rare?

Thus, it is known that to follow the Way of the world is easy, but to die for it is difficult. To die for the world is easy, but to succeed in its affairs is difficult. If one could succeed, why should they calculate the cost of death and life?

If they could not succeed, even death would bring no benefit—how much more so when considering whether their cause was just or unjust?

Better to live in righteousness than to die in injustice. Better to die in righteousness than to live in injustice. This lies in the choice between loyalty and cleverness.

Death is indeed regrettable, but the noble pursuit is to succeed in the world’s affairs. If they failed the world’s affairs, what good would one death do to cover their guilt?

Life is indeed lovable, but the noble pursuit is to succeed in the world’s affairs. If they failed the world’s affairs, what good would one life do to gather merit?

Alas! Those who could succeed in the world’s affairs and also not lose their righteousness while living—who were they if not Han’s Liu Hou (留侯) and Tang’s Liang Gong (梁公)?

Without these two men, the fate of the Han and Tang dynasties might have nearly shifted. How much better than those who lived and died in vain!

Those who lived and died in vain are like the reeds of Xiao (萧) and Ai (艾)—loyalty and cleverness do not lie between them.

Confucius said in *"Observing Things"* (Chapter 59, #4):
A virtuous person governing a state for a hundred years can indeed conquer violence and eliminate killing. Truly, this is a profound statement.

From the height of chaos to the height of order, there must be three transformations.

The laws of the Three Sovereigns knew no killing; the laws of the Five Hegemons knew no life.
A Hegemon transformed once and became a King; a King transformed once and became an Emperor; an Emperor transformed once and became a Sovereign.

As for life, what else could it be but a hundred years?

Thus, the age of the Three Sovereigns was like spring, the age of the Five Emperors like summer, the age of the Three Kings like autumn, and the age of the Five Hegemons like winter.
Like spring, it was warm and gentle.
Like summer, it was scorching.
Like autumn, it was chilly.
Like winter, it was piercing cold.
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter—these are the seasons of Heaven.

*The Book of Changes, The Book of Documents, The Book of Poetry, and The Spring and Autumn Annals*—these are the classics of the sages.
When Heaven’s seasons do not err, the year’s harvest is fulfilled.
When the sacred texts do not falter, the ruler’s virtue is complete.
Heaven has its fixed seasons; the sages have their fixed classics.
If one follows them rightly, they are right.
If one follows them perversely, they are perverse.
Between right and perverse, there lies the Dao.

If one follows them rightly, it is called the *Zheng Dao* (正道).
If one follows them perversely, it is called the *Xie Dao* (邪道).
Does right and perverse arise from man, or from Heaven?
Heaven is born from the Dao; Earth is formed from the Dao; things take shape from the Dao; man acts through the Dao.
Heaven, Earth, man, and things differ, yet all arise from the Dao.

The Dao—what is it?
The Dao is formless, yet when followed, it manifests in affairs.
Like the way of roads, smooth and clear, so that even after ten thousand years, men know their destination.

Some say: When the Dao of the *junzi* (君子) flourishes, the Dao of the *xiaoren* (小人) wanes.
When the Dao of the *junzi* wanes, the Dao of the *xiaoren* flourishes.
If the former is true, then the latter is false.
If the latter is true, then the former is false.
How do we know the nature of the *Zheng Dao* and the *Xie Dao*?

Alas! This is a thief’s argument against humanity.
It is not said that a ruler acts as a ruler, a minister as a minister, a father as a father, a son as a son, a husband as a husband, a wife as a wife, a *junzi* as a *junzi*, a *xiaoren* as a *xiaoren*, the Central States as the Central States, and the barbarians as the barbarians—this is called the *Zheng Dao*.

But when a ruler acts as a minister, a minister as a ruler, a father as a son, a son as a father, a husband as a wife, a wife as a husband, a *junzi* and *xiaoren* both act as *junzi*, the Central States act as barbarians, and barbarians act as the Central States—this is called the *Xie Dao*.

In the well-ordered ages of the Three Dynasties, there was never one who did not uphold the Dao of human relationships.
In the chaotic ages of the Three Dynasties, there was never one who did not disrupt the Dao of human relationships.
Later ages that emulated the well-ordered ages of the Three Dynasties never failed to uphold human relationships.
Later ages that emulated the chaotic ages of the Three Dynasties never failed to disrupt human relationships.

From the Three Dynasties onward, the Han and Tang were the most flourishing, yet they never failed to rise through order and fall through chaos. How much more so those less flourishing than the Han and Tang?

Their rise was never without the flourishing of the ruler’s Dao, the father’s Dao, the husband’s Dao, the *junzi*’s Dao, and the Central States’ Dao.
Their fall was never without the flourishing of the minister’s Dao, the son’s Dao, the wife’s Dao, the *xiaoren*’s Dao, and the barbarians’ Dao.

Alas! The two Daos oppose each other—why are orderly ages few while chaotic ages are many?
Why are *junzi* few while *xiaoren* are many?

It is asked: Do you not know that *yang* is one while *yin* is two?
Heaven and Earth are born from this Dao—how much more so man and things?
Man is the most spiritually refined of things.
Though things are refined, none are as refined as man, yet they are born from this Dao—how much more so man, who is more refined than things?

Thus, man is also a thing, but because he is the most refined, he is specially called *man*.

*"Observing Things"* (Chapter 60, #5):
The Sun traverses Heaven’s *yuan* (元), the Moon traverses Heaven’s *hui* (會), the stars traverse the *yun* (運) of the heavens, and the constellations traverse Heaven’s *shi* (世).

The *yuan* of *yuan* is one; the *hui* of *yuan* is twelve; the *yun* of *yuan* is three hundred sixty; the *shi* of *yuan* is four thousand three hundred twenty.
The *yuan* of *hui* is twelve; the *hui* of *hui* is one hundred forty-four; the *yun* of *hui* is four thousand three hundred twenty; the *shi* of *hui* is fifty-one thousand eight hundred forty.
The *yuan* of *yun* is three hundred sixty; the *hui* of *yun* is four thousand three hundred twenty; the *yun* of *yun* is one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred; the *shi* of *yun* is one million fifty-five thousand two hundred.

The *yun* of *shi* proceeds in force by the affairs of power.
The *shi* of *shi* proceeds in force by the affairs of force.

Time has waxing and waning; affairs have origins and transformations. Without the Sage, none can exhaust them.
Hence Confucius said:
*"One may study with him, but not yet travel the Dao with him.
One may travel the Dao with him, but not yet establish it with him.
One may establish it with him, but not yet wield it with authority.
Thus, knowing the ten thousand ages’ times, the ten thousand ages’ principles—how can one lightly speak of them by drawing lines on the ground?"*

The Three Sovereigns are the Spring.
The Five Emperors are the Summer.
The Three Kings are the Autumn.
The Five Hegemons are the Winter.
The Seven States are the lingering cold of Winter.
The Han King was insufficient; the Jin Hegemon was excessive.
The Three Kingdoms were the mighty among the Hegemons.
The Sixteen Kingdoms were the clustered Hegemons.
The Five Dynasties of the South were the Hegemons’ borrowed chariots.
The Five Dynasties of the North were the Hegemons’ relay stations.
The Sui was the son of Jin.
The Tang was the younger brother of Han.
The Hegemons of the late Sui’s prefectures were the lingering waves of Jiang-Han.
The Hegemons of the late Tang’s military circuits were the residual radiance of the sun and moon.
The Hegemons of the Five Dynasties were stars before dawn.

From Emperor Yao to the present, spanning over three thousand years above and below, with over a hundred ages before and after, the recorded and transmitted accounts that can be clearly chronicled within the Four Seas and Nine Regions—whether united or divided, whether in order or in ruin, whether strong or weak, whether leading or following—never has there been one who could unify customs across generations.

Ah! The ancients called thirty years one *shi*—was this not for a reason?
Await the inevitable harmony of transformation, the thorough penetration of teaching, and only then can the people’s sentiments begin to change.
If there arises a Sage of the Age to succeed and flourish in each generation, then even if the people are as barbaric as the Yi and Di, three transformations suffice to elevate the Imperial Way.

Alas! There are no ages of a hundred years, no Sages of a hundred years. By the time succession occurs, how could the worthy and unworthy differ by more than half?

Is it not so with the difficulty of time? Is it not so with the difficulty of people?

From *Observing Things*, Chapter Sixty-One:
The *body* of the Greater Yang is ten; the *body* of the Greater Yin is twelve.
The *body* of the Lesser Yang is ten; the *body* of the Lesser Yin is twelve.
The *body* of Lesser Rigidity is ten; the *body* of Lesser Compliance is twelve.
The *body* of Greater Rigidity is ten; the *body* of Greater Compliance is twelve.

Advancing the *bodies* of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity, while retreating the *bodies* of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Compliance, and Lesser Compliance—this is called the *application numbers* of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity.

Advancing the *bodies* of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Compliance, and Lesser Compliance, while retreating the *bodies* of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity—this is called the *application numbers* of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Compliance, and Lesser Compliance.

The *bodies* of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity total one hundred sixty; the *bodies* of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Compliance, and Lesser Compliance total one hundred ninety-two.
The *application numbers* of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity total one hundred twelve; the *application numbers* of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Compliance, and Lesser Compliance total one hundred fifty-two.

Using the *application numbers* of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity to initiate the *application numbers* of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Compliance, and Lesser Compliance—this is called the *variable numbers* of the sun, moon, and stars.
Using the *application numbers* of Greater Yin, Lesser Yin, Greater Compliance, and Lesser Compliance to harmonize with the *application numbers* of Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity—this is called the *transformative numbers* of water, fire, earth, and metal.

The *variable numbers* of the sun, moon, and stars total seventeen thousand twenty-four—this is called the *dynamic numbers*.
The *transformative numbers* of water, fire, earth, and metal total seventeen thousand twenty-four—this is called the *static numbers*.

When the *variable numbers* (of the sun, moon, and stars) and the *transformative numbers* (of water, fire, earth, and metal) are further harmonized, the **total harmonized numbers** amount to **28,981,165,760**—this is called the **dynamic-static harmonized numbers**.

The sun, moon, and stars pertain to the *variables* of **heat, cold, day, and night**. Water, fire, earth, and metal pertain to the *transformatives* of **rain, wind, dew, and thunder**.

Heat, cold, day, and night correspond to the *variables* of **nature, disposition, form, and substance** of all things.
Rain, wind, dew, and thunder correspond to the *transformatives* of **movement, flight, plants, and wood** of all things.

Heat *varies* the **flight of plants and wood** in their **nature**,
Cold *varies* the **flight of plants and wood** in their **disposition**,
Day *varies* the **flight of plants and wood** in their **form**,
Night *varies* the **flight of plants and wood** in their **substance**.

Rain *transforms* the **movement of nature, disposition, form, and substance** into **movement**,
Wind *transforms* the **movement of nature, disposition, form, and substance** into **flight**,
Dew *transforms* the **movement of nature, disposition, form, and substance** into **plants**,
Thunder *transforms* the **movement of nature, disposition, form, and substance** into **wood**.

Nature, disposition, form, and substance are rooted in **Heaven**,
Flight, movement, plants, and wood are rooted in **Earth**.

What is rooted in Heaven is called the **division of Yin and Yang**,
What is rooted in Earth is called the **division of Compliance and Rigidity**.

The divisions of Yin and Yang, Compliance and Rigidity—these encompass the **Dao/Way of all things in Heaven and Earth**.

To embody the Dao/Way of all things in Heaven and Earth is the **human calling**.

In the *Observing Things* chapter (of the *Sixteen Hexagrams*), there are:
Things of the **sun-sun**—these are **flight-flight**,
Things of the **sun-moon**—these are **flight-movement**,
Things of the **sun-star**—these are **flight-wood**,
Things of the **sun-asterism**—these are **flight-plants**.

Things of the **moon-sun**—these are **movement-flight**,
Things of the **moon-moon**—these are **movement-movement**,
Things of the **moon-star**—these are **movement-wood**,
Things of the **moon-asterism**—these are **movement-plants**.

Things of the **star-sun**—these are **wood-flight**,
Things of the **star-moon**—these are **wood-movement**,

What things can **thousand to the thousandth power** divide **one-thing** if not **fine-things**?
What people can **thousand to the thousandth power** divide **one-person** if not **fine-people**?

It is indeed known that things have greatness and smallness,
People have virtue and folly.

If one **transfers** the **virtue/power** of **Wu Tian** creating **myriad-things** to create **myriad-people**,
Would this not be called the **most divine**?
If one **transfers** the **function** of **Wu Tian** nourishing **myriad-things** to nourish **myriad-people**,
Would this not be called the **most sage**?

Now I know that **embodying form** is great,
If not the **greatest sages and gods**, who would not be **unworthy** of heaven and earth?
What is called **observing things** is not done with the eyes.

Not observing with the eyes, but observing with the **heart/mind**.
Not observing with the **heart/mind**, but observing with **principle/reason**.
All things under heaven have **principle/reason**,
All have **nature**,
All have **fate/destiny**.

What is called **principle/reason** can be known only when **exhausted**.
What is called **nature** can be known only when **fully realized**.
What is called **fate/destiny** can be known only when **attained**.

These three knowings are the **true knowings** of all under heaven.
Even sages cannot surpass them.
Those who surpass them are not what is called **sages**.

The **mirror** is so called because it can **illuminate**—
It is said that it does not conceal the forms of all things.

Yet, although the mirror does not conceal the forms of all things,
It cannot **unify** the forms of all things as **water** does.

Although water can **unify** the forms of all things,
It cannot **unify** the **emotions** of all things as the **sage** does.

The **sage** can **unify** the **emotions** of all things—
It is called **reverse observation**,
Not observing things with **oneself**,
But observing things with things themselves.

If one can observe things with things themselves,
How could there be any **oneself** in between?

Thus, it is known that **oneself** is also **people**,
And **people** are also **oneself**.
**Oneself** and **people** are all **things**.

This is why one can use the **eyes of all under heaven** as one’s own eyes,
So that one’s sight observes nothing it cannot see.
Use the **ears of all under heaven** as one’s own ears,
So that one’s hearing hears nothing it cannot hear.
Use the **mouth of all under heaven** as one’s own mouth,
So that one’s speech speaks nothing it cannot speak.
Use the **heart/mind of all under heaven** as one’s own heart/mind,
So that one’s deliberation plans nothing it cannot devise.

The **observation** of all under heaven,
In terms of **seeing**, is it not most **broad**?
The **hearing** of all under heaven,
In terms of **understanding**, is it not most **far-reaching**?
The **speech** of all under heaven,
In terms of **discourse**, is it not most **elevated**?
The **deliberation** of all under heaven,
In terms of **joy**, is it not most **great**?

If one can perform the most **broad**, **far-reaching**, **elevated**, and **great** deeds,
Yet in the midst of them does nothing for **oneself**—
Would this not be called the **most divine and most sage**?

Not only do I call this the **most divine and most sage**,
But all under heaven call this the **most divine and most sage**.
Not only does one age of all under heaven call this the **most divine and most sage**,
But all ages of all under heaven call this the **most divine and most sage**.

None have known beyond this.
Thus concludes the **Supreme Polarity (Huang Ji)** chapter on **Embodying the Age** (Jing Shi), Volume 11 of the **Imperial Standard Tripitaka (Zhengtong Daozang)**.

The Five is the measure of Heaven, the Five is the measure of Earth; together they form Ten, the completeness of number. Heaven varies the One into Four, and Earth varies the One into Four. The Four are manifest forms, while the One is formless—this is called the Extremes of Being and Non-Being.

Heaven’s manifest forms number Four, yet its active principles are Three, with One unused. Earth’s manifest forms number Four, yet its active principles are Three, with One unused. Thus, the formless One signifies the Natural; the unused One signifies the Dao. The Three active principles correspond to Heaven, Earth, and Man. The Eight Trigrams’ unchanging symbols number Four, their reversing symbols Two—thus Six Trigrams transform to form Eight. The Double Trigrams’ unchanging symbols number Eight, their reversing symbols Twenty-Eight—thus Thirty-Six transformations yield Sixty-Four.

Hence, the lines cease at Six, the Trigrams complete at Eight, the stalks exhaust at Thirty-Six, and the Double Trigrams reach Sixty-Four. The Trigrams complete at Eight, the Double Trigrams at Sixty-Four; the lines complete at Six, the stalks exhaust at Thirty-Six, and the Double Trigrams extend to Three Hundred Eighty-Four.

Heaven has Four Seasons, each Season Four Months, each Month Forty Days—Four times Four is Sixteen, yet one is subtracted from each, making each Season Three Months, each Month Thirty Days. The Four Seasons are the manifest numbers; the Three Months and Thirty Days are the active numbers. Though the Four manifest forms are complete, one is always unused. Thus, the active numbers stop at Three and reach Nine.

Manifest numbers are always even—thus Four, Twelve. Active numbers are always odd—thus Three, Nine. Why do great numbers fall short while lesser numbers overflow? Because the great is unseen, while the small is visible. Hence, Seasons stop at Four, Months at Three, and Days overflow at Ten. Therefore, Man’s limbs number Four, yet his fingers number Ten.

Heaven is manifest in the South and hidden in the North, reaching Six yet leaving Seven. Thus, Man knows his front, is ignorant of his rear, and vaguely perceives his sides. Heaven’s manifest forms number Four, its active principles Three; Earth’s manifest forms number Four, its active principles Three. Heaven overcomes Earth, Earth overcomes Heaven, yet the overcoming lies in Earth—like the leftover daylight in night. Hence, Heaven is Three while Earth is Four; Heaven has Three Celestial Stems, Earth has Four Branches.

Yet Earth’s vastness is both seen and hidden—its leftover portion is called *Yè* (邪)? Heaven has Two Primordials, Earth has Two Primordials, and together they employ Two transformations to form the Eight Trigrams. Heaven has Four Primordials, Earth has Four Primordials, and together they employ Eighteen transformations to form the Sixty-Four Hexagrams.

Thus, the Small Accomplished Trigrams have Four unchanging and Two reversing—totaling Six. The Great Accomplished Hexagrams have Eight unchanging and Twenty-Eight reversing—totaling Thirty-Six. *Qián* (乾), *Kūn* (坤), *Lí* (离), and *Kǎn* (坎) are the ancestors of the Thirty-Six Hexagrams. *Duì* (兑), *Zhèn* (震), *Xùn* (巽), and *Gèn* (艮) are the ancestors of the Twenty-Eight Hexagrams.

*Qián* has Seven children, *Duì* Six, *Lí* Five, *Zhèn* Four, *Xùn* Three, *Kǎn* Two, *Gèn* One, and *Kūn* is wholly Yin—thus it has no children. *Qián* has Seven children, *Kūn* Six, *Duì* Five, *Gèn* Four, *Lí* Three, *Kǎn* Two, *Zhèn* One, and *Xùn* is rigid—thus it has no children.

*Qián* and *Kūn* undergo Seven transformations, so the extremes of day and night do not exceed Seven divisions. *Duì* and *Gèn* undergo Six transformations, so the Month stops at Six, totaling Twelve. *Lí* and *Kǎn* undergo Five transformations, so the Day stops at Five, totaling Ten. *Zhèn* and *Xùn* undergo Four transformations, so the form stops at Four, totaling Eight.

The Trigrams’ unchanging and reversing transformations total Thirty-Six, and the lines number Two Hundred Sixteen—these are the active numbers’ stalks. Thirty-Six minus Four is Thirty-Two; again minus Four is Twenty-Eight; again minus Four is Twenty-Four. Thus, the Hexagram positions number Thirty-Two (subtracting Four), Heaven’s positions Twenty-Eight (subtracting Eight), and Earth’s positions Twenty-Four (subtracting Twelve).

The Four are *Qián*, *Kūn*, *Gāo* (高), and *Kǎn*. The Eight are *Bìngyí* (并颐), *Fú* (孚), *Dàguò* (大过), and *Xiǎoguò* (小过). The Twelve are *Duì*, *Zhèn*, *Tài* (泰), and *Jìjì* (既济). The Sun has Eight positions, yet its active use stops at Seven (subtracting *Qián*). The Moon has Eight positions, yet its active use stops at Six (subtracting *Duì*). The Stars have Eight positions, yet their active use stops at Five (subtracting *Lí*). The Celestial Stems have Eight positions, yet their active use stops at Four (subtracting *Zhèn*). The Sun’s Eight positions’ numbers stop at Seven (subtracting *Tài*).

The Moon begins at *Duì*—since the Moon cannot match the Sun’s numbers, Twelve Months always leave Twelve extra days. Yang lacks Ten, so it is deficient at the end. Yin lacks One, so it is deficient at the start. *Qián*, being Yang within Yang, cannot vary—thus a year only counts Twelve Months. *Zhèn*, being Yin within Yang, cannot vary—thus the Twelve hours of a day are unseen. *Duì* (Yang within Yin) and *Lí* (Yin within Yang) can vary—thus the numbers of day and month can be divided.

Hence, Yin numbers begin at Twelve, Yang numbers at Thirty, and the constant remains Two and Six. A year reveals Months, a Month reveals Days, a Day reveals Hours—Yang governs Yin. Thus, Heaven’s Four transformations contain Earth’s Four transformations, and the Sun’s transformations contain those of the Moon and Stars.

Hence, one *guà* contains four *guà*—the Sun has one *wèi*, the Moon has one *wèi*, the Stars have one *wèi*, and the *chéng* have one *wèi*. The Sun has four *wèi*, the Moon has four *wèi*, the Stars have four *wèi*, and the *chéng* have four *wèi*, making sixteen *wèi* in total. This single transformation exhausts the numbers of the Sun and Moon.

Heaven has four transformations, Earth has four transformations. Transformations have periods of *zhǎng* (expansion) and *xiāo* (contraction). With sixteen transformations, the numbers of Heaven and Earth are exhausted.

The Sun begins at *wèi* One, the Moon at *wèi* Two, the Stars at *wèi* Three, and the *chéng* at *wèi* Four. When extended, Yang numbers are constant at Six, and Yin numbers are constant at Two, resulting in twelve transformations. Thus, the cycles of great and small are complete.

Three hundred sixty transformations yield **129,600** (*shí'èr wàn jiǔ qiān liù bǎi*). **129,600** transformations yield **167,961,600,000** (*yī bǎi liù shí qī yì jiǔ qiān liù bǎi yī shí liù wàn*). **167,961,600,000** transformations yield **28,211,990,745,600** (*èr shí bā qiān èr bǎi yī yī zài jiǔ bǎi jiǔ shí wàn qī qiān sì bǎi wǔ shí liù yì*). Taking **360** as the measure for *shí* (hours), **129,600** as the measure for *rì* (days), **167,961,600,000** as the measure for *yuè* (months), and **28,211,990,745,600** as the measure for *nián* (years), the numbers of great and small cycles are established.

When **28,211,990,745,600** is divided into twelve, the first six divisions are *zhǎng* (expansion), the last six are *xiāo* (contraction), corresponding to the twelve months of a year, and advancing or retreating by **360** days.

When **167,961,600,000** is divided into thirty, it corresponds to the twelve months of a year, advancing or retreating by **360** days. When the same number is divided into thirty, it corresponds to the thirty days of a month, advancing or retreating by **60** days according to the expansion or contraction of the great cycle.

When **129,600** is divided into twelve, it corresponds to the twelve *shí* (hours) of a day, advancing or retreating by **6** days.

When **360** is taken as the measure for *shí* (hours), it is adjusted by the progress or retreat of the small cycle to correspond to the hours of day and night.

From the sixteen transformations, removing the *jiāo* (intercalary) numbers and retaining the *yòng* (functional) numbers yields **28,211,990,745,600**. Dividing this into twelve, the first six divisions are *zhǎng* (expansion), the last six are *xiāo* (contraction), each division yielding **167,961,600,000**. Each **167,961,600,000** generates one *fēn* (subdivision), advancing by **60** days. Six divisions generate six *fēn*, advancing by **360** days, still leaving one *fēn* as remainder. Thus, seven divisions are opened, advancing by **366** days. The retreat follows the same principle.

Removing **2,160** (*èr qiān yī bǎi liù shí*) from **129,600** leaves the *jiāo* (intercalary) numbers. Retaining **7** (*qī*) of the **10** (*shí*) yields the *yòng* (functional) numbers. Three functional numbers combine to form Six, with the addition of the remaining *fēn*, resulting in Seven. Seven yields **9,720** (*jiǔ qiān qī bǎi èr shí*) years, halved to **4,860** (*sì qiān bā bǎi liù shí*) years, advancing by **6** days. Days have *zhòu* (daylight) and *yè* (night), and numbers have *zhuó* (deficient) and *yú* (excess), forming twelve days. Every **3,600** (*sān qiān liù bǎi*) years advance one day, totaling **43,200** (*sì shí sān qiān èr bǎi*) years to advance twelve days. The remaining **2,160** years advance the remaining **6** (*liù*) *fēn*, combining with the intercalary **2,160** years, advancing twelve *fēn* in total, for the *rùn* (leap) days. Thus, the small cycle’s transformations total **60** (*liù shí*), forming **366** (*sān bǎi liù shí*) days.

*Qián* represents One (*yī*), and its five *yáo* (*wǔ yáo*) are divided into *Dà Yǒu* (Great Possession), corresponding to **360** (*sān bǎi liù shí*). Its four *yáo* are divided into *Xiǎo Chù* (Small Accumulation), corresponding to **129,600** (*shí'èr wàn jiǔ qiān liù bǎi*). Its three *yáo* are divided into *Lǚ* (Treading), corresponding to **167,961,600,000** (*yī bǎi liù shí qī yì jiǔ qiān liù bǎi yī shí liù wàn*). Its two *yáo* are divided into *Tóng Rén* (Like People), corresponding to **28,211,990,745,600** (*èr shí bā qiān èr bǎi yī yī zài jiǔ bǎi jiǔ shí wàn qī qiān sì bǎi wǔ shí liù yì*). Its first *yáo* is divided into *Gòu* (Meeting), corresponding to **795,866,110,994,648,843,919,360** (*qī zēn jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi bā shí wàn liù qiān yī bǎi yī shí nǎi jiǔ qiān jiǔ bǎi sì shí wàn qī qiān sì bǎi wǔ shí liù yì jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi bā shí wàn qī qiān sì bǎi wǔ shí liù yì*).

This is called the division of numbers. The great is divided into the small, all descending from the upper to the sixth, thus corresponding to Yang numbers. As one division becomes twelve, nine divisions become **360**.

Heaven governs the *tǐ* (body), thus eight transformations culminate in sixteen. Earth divides the *yòng* (functional), thus six transformations culminate in twelve. Heaven begins at One and ends at **795,866,110,994,648,843,919,360**. Earth begins at Twelve and ends at **246,980,738,154,918,499,720,000,000,000,000**.

「One generates Two, forming *Yāng* (Central), corresponding to the number **12**. Two generates Four, forming *Dà Zhuàng* (Great Strength), corresponding to the number **432,200**. Four generates Eight, forming *Tài* (Calm), corresponding to the number **55,987,200**. Eight generates Sixteen, forming *Lín* (Approaching), corresponding to the number **944,369,969,150,200,000,000,000,000**. Sixteen generates Thirty-Two, forming *Fù* (Returning), corresponding to the number **265,228,870,366,648,880,294,790,320,000,000,000,000**. Thirty-Two generates Sixty-Four, forming *Kūn* (Receptive), corresponding to the number **Without Limit** (*wújí*). This is called the **Long Numbers** (*chángshù*).

The small becoming large, all ascend from below to above, thus **Yin numbers** are used to correspond to them. When there is Earth, then there is Two. When there is Two, then there is day and night. With Two and Three, they interweave and form change. Thus, the *Yì* (Changes) begins with Two to generate, and numbers vary with Twelve, while One is not a number. Though One is not a number, numbers are formed with it.

Heaven’s movement is endless, never ceasing with day and night. Humans dwell upon Earth, thus they consider day and night. Hence, the numbers of Earth above are taken as the functional use for humans.

From *Lín* (Approaching) upward in Heaven, from *Shùn* (Tumbling) upward in Earth, are the **Evolutionary Numbers** (*yùnshù*). From *Tóng Rén* (Communion) downward in Heaven, from *Dùn* (Retreat) downward in Earth, are the **Annual Numbers** (*niánshù*). Evolutionary Numbers belong to Heaven, while Annual Numbers belong to Earth.

From *Bì* (Adornment) upward in Heaven, from *Gèn* (Binding) upward in Earth, are the **Functional Numbers** (*yòngshù*). From *Míng Yí* (Darkness of Brightness) downward in Heaven, from *Pǐ* (Opposition) downward in Earth, are the **Interchange Numbers** (*jiāoshù*). From *Zhèn* (Shaking) upward in Heaven, from *Jìn* (Advancing) upward in Earth, are the **Manifest Numbers** (*yǒushù*). From *Yì* (Benefit) downward in Heaven, from *Yù* (Joy) downward in Earth, are the **Non-Manifest Numbers** (*wúshù*).

Heaven’s Manifest Numbers begin at *Qián* (Heaven) and end at *Zhèn* (Shaking), the rest falling into the **Non-Manifest** (*wú*), thus Heaven’s *chén* (hourly divisions) are unseen. Earth discards One and begins at Twelve, thus Earth’s fire is always concealed. Hence, Heaven takes the *tǐ* (body) as its foundation, always hiding its base. Earth takes the *yòng* (functional) as its root, always concealing its use.

One’s time halts at **three months**, one month’s time halts at **thirty days**, all discarding their *chén*-numbers. Thus, the eighty-eight hexagrams of the *Yì* total **64**, with **8** unchanging and **7** variable. Seven times eight yields **56**, and its meaning also arises from this.

The **Yāng** (solid/active) lines are day numbers, the **Yīn** (broken/passive) lines are night numbers. Heaven and Earth interlink, Yin and Yang interact, thus day and night alternate, and firmness and softness interweave. Spring and Summer are Yang, thus day numbers are many, night numbers are few. Autumn and Winter are Yin, thus day numbers are few, night numbers are many.

The **284** functional strategies of *tǐ*-numbers, discarding the strategies of *Qián* (Heaven), *Kūn* (Receptive), *Lí* (Fire), and *Kàn* (Water), become the **256** Functional Numbers. The **270** functional strategies of *tǐ*-numbers’ use, discarding the strategies of *Qián* (Heaven) and *Lí* (Fire), *Kàn* (Water), yield **252** as the functional use of Functional Numbers.

The **270** functional strategies of *tǐ*-numbers’ use, with **156** as Yang and **114** as Yin, discarding the *Lí* (Fire) strategies, yields **152** Yang and **112** Yin, forming the **actual functional use numbers**. Indeed, Yang discards *Lí* (Fire) and employs *Qián* (Heaven), while Yin discards *Kūn* (Receptive) and employs *Kàn* (Water).

Thus, Heaven’s **112** Yang strategies, discarding its Yin, become **112** Yang. Earth’s **112** Yin strategies and **40** Yang strategies, discarding its southern and northern Yang, become **152** Yin and **112** Yang. At the extremes of the south (*Dàshǔ* Great Heat) and north (*Dàhán* Great Cold), things cannot generate, hence they are discarded. The remaining **40** belong to Heaven’s surplus division.

When Yang invades Yin, day invades night. Thus, on Earth, they are combined as **152** Yang and **112** Yin. Yang discards the *Qián* (Heaven) strategies, Yin discards the *Kàn* (Water) strategies, yielding **144** Yang and **18** Yin as the functional use of Functional Numbers.

Yang **36**, multiplied by three, becomes **18** (correction: **108**). Yin **36**, multiplied by three, becomes **18** (correction: **108**). Three Yang and three Yin, each representing half of Yin and Yang. Yang has an extra **36**, combined as **144** Yang and **18** Yin.

Thus, the **270** functional strategies of *tǐ*-numbers’ use, with **264** as actual functional use, yield **252** as the functional use of Functional Numbers.

There are **64** hexagrams, yet their functional use stops at **36**. There are **284** lines, yet their functional use stops at **216**. Sixty-Four divided yields **256**, thus one hexagram discarding its first and last lines also totals **256**. This is the number for generating things.

Hence, *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water) are the masters of generating things, as *Lí* contains four Yang lines and *Kàn* contains four Yin lines, thus the generation of things must involve four.

Yang **112**, Yin **112**, discarding the *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water) lines, yields **216**. Yin and Yang’s **40** (correction: **48**) together form **256**.

Thus, eight hexagrams use six lines, with *Qián* (Heaven) and *Kūn* (Receptive) as their masters. Six lines use four positions, with *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water) as their masters.

Hence, Heaven’s twilight and dawn do not generate things, yet the midday does. Earth’s southern and northern extremes do not generate things, yet the center does.

What is the purpose of *tǐ*-numbers? To generate things. What is the purpose of Functional Numbers? To govern the evolution. The evolution belongs to Heaven.»

「The generator of things is Earth. Heaven moves alone, so it multiplies its Functional Numbers by themselves, and uses the applications of these Functional Numbers as the timing for generating things. Earth generates in pairs, so it uses the applications of the *tǐ*-numbers (Yang multiplied by Yin) as the count for generating things.

Heaven’s *tǐ*-number is three, hence six; six multiplied again by six yields **216**, thus the *Qián* (Heaven) hexagram’s total lines are **216**. Earth’s *tǐ*-number is two#25, hence twelve; twelve multiplied again yields **144**, thus the *Kūn* (Receptive) hexagram’s total lines are **144**.

*Qián* (Heaven) uses nine, hence three; its eight lines total **24**, and nine multiplied by them also yields **216**. Doubling its eight lines gives **16**, and nine multiplied by them also yields **144**.

*Kūn* (Receptive) uses six, hence three; its twelve lines total **36**, and six multiplied by them also yields **216**. Doubling its twelve lines gives **24**, and six multiplied by them also yields **144**.

When *Kūn* (Receptive) takes **2** of its twelve lines, **4** of its sixteen lines, and **1** and **half** of its six lines as the surplus for *Qián* (Heaven), then *Qián* (Heaven) obtains **252**, and *Kūn* (Receptive) obtains **18**.

Four Yang hexagrams with twelve lines each yield **8 Yang and 4 Yin**, and when **36** multiplies the Yang lines and **24** multiplies the Yin lines, the total is **384**.

The opposing pairs of hexagrams are all **6 Yang and 6 Yin**. In the *Yì* (Book of Changes), the **6 Yang and 6 Yin** yield **12 pairs**. Discarding the **4 stoppers** (the four central lines of *Qián*, *Kūn*, *Lí*, *Kàn*) leaves **8 Yang and 4 Yin** or **8 Yin and 4 Yang**, each yielding **6 pairs**. The **10 Yang and 2 Yin** or **10 Yin and 2 Yang** yield **3 pairs** each.

The *tǐ*-numbers total **384**, yet the Functional Numbers conclude at **360**. Why? Because *Qián* (Heaven), *Kūn* (Receptive), *Lí* (Fire), and *Kàn* (Water) are not fully utilized.

Why are *Qián*, *Kūn*, *Lí*, and *Kàn* not fully utilized? Their non-utilization is what completes the **360** Functional Numbers. Thus, all things transform and change, yet these four do not change. Only because they do not change can they enable change.

Why does the Functional Number conclude at **360**, yet there are **366**? It is due to numerical excess. What purpose does this numerical excess serve? It is for the complete use of *Qián* (Heaven).

Why are *Qián* (Heaven) and *Kūn* (Receptive) not fully utilized? Because lone Yang does not generate, and scant Yin does not complete. Why are *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water) used only half? *Lí* (Fire) is in the east and *Kàn* (Water) in the west, marking the Yin-Yang midpoint, as the gates of spring and autumn, day and night.

Sometimes *Qián* (Heaven) is used, sometimes *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water). Why? Because *Qián* (Heaven) governs excess, so it is used fully. When excess is divided, Yang invades Yin and day invades night, so *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water) are used half.

*Qián* (Heaven) fully utilizes excess, so it is used in its entirety. *Kūn* (Receptive) governs emptiness, so it is fully unused. When Yang invades Yin and Yin invades Yang, *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water) are used only half.

Thus, Heaven’s southern half is fully visible, while its northern half is fully unseen, and the eastern and western halves are each half-seen. *Lí* (Fire) and *Kàn* (Water) are the boundaries of Yin and Yang. Hence, *Lí* (Fire) corresponds to *Yín* (the Tiger, third earthly branch), and *Kàn* (Water) to *Shēn* (the Monkey, seventh earthly branch), yet their numbers often exceed these limits. This is because of the overflow of Yin and Yang.

However, Functional Numbers do not exceed *Yín* (the Tiger), and their paired applications do not exceed *Shēn* (the Monkey)#28. Sometimes *Lí* (Fire) corresponds to *Mǎo* (the Hare, fourth earthly branch), and *Kàn* (Water) to *Yǒu* (the Rooster, tenth earthly branch).

*Qián* (Heaven) has **48**, and one quarter of it is subdued by Yin. *Kūn* (Receptive) has **48**, and one quarter of it subdues the Yang. Thus, *Qián* (Heaven) retains **36**, while *Kūn* (Receptive) retains **12**.

Yang governs advancement, so the **360 days** are taken as the advancing count. Yin governs retreat, so the **12 months** each retreat by **12 days**.

Counting forward: *Qián* (Heaven) **1**, *Duì* (Joy) **2**, *Lí* (Fire) **3**, *Zhèn* (Thunder) **4**, *Xùn* (Wind) **5**, *Kàn* (Water) **6**, *Gèn* (Mountain) **7**, *Kūn* (Receptive) **8**. Counting backward: *Zhèn* (Thunder) **1**, *Lí* (Fire) and *Duì* (Joy) **2**, *Qián* (Heaven) **3**, *Xùn* (Wind) **4**, *Kàn* (Water) and *Gèn* (Mountain) **5**, *Kūn* (Receptive) **6**.

*Qián* (Heaven) **48**, *Duì* (Joy) **30**, *Lí* (Fire) **24**, *Zhèn* (Thunder) **10**, *Kūn* (Receptive) **12**, *Gèn* (Mountain) **20**, *Kàn* (Water) **36**, *Xùn* (Wind) **40**.

*Qián* (Heaven) **36**, *Kūn* (Receptive) **12**, *Lí* (Fire), *Duì* (Joy), and *Xùn* (Wind) each **28**, while *Kàn* (Water), *Gèn* (Mountain), and *Zhèn* (Thunder) each **20**. *Duì* (Joy) and *Lí* (Fire) are upright above, so reconsider them.

The circular number has **1**, and the square number has **2**—this is the meaning of odd and even. **6** is equivalent to **1**. **12** is equivalent to **2**.

Heaven is round, while Earth is square. The circular is the number that begins with **1** and accumulates to **6**. The square is the number that begins with **1** and accumulates to **8**, but when transformed, it begins with **4** and accumulates to **12**.

**6** always transforms with **6**. **8** always transforms with **8**. **12**, however, also transforms with **8**—this is the Dao of Nature.

**8** is the substance of Heaven and Earth. **6** is Heaven’s application. **12** is Earth’s application. Heaven transforms the square into the round, yet always retains its **1**. Earth divides **1** into **4**, yet always holds to its square.

Heaven transforms its substance but does not transform its application, while Earth transforms its application but does not transform its substance. **6** combined with its **1** becomes **7**. **12** combined with its **4** becomes **16**.

Yang governs advancement, so Heaven combines its **1** to make **7**. Yin governs retreat, so Earth discards its **4** and stops at **12**.

Thus, Yang always retains **1**, while Yin always conceals **1**. Hence, Heaven and Earth’s substance concludes at **8**, Heaven’s application reaches its limit at **7**, and Earth’s application stops at **12**.

The circular, when applied to the square, transforms **1** into **4**, and **4** discarding **1** leaves **3**. **3** transforms into **9**, and **9** discarding **3** leaves **6**.»

The square draws upon the circle for its substance, so **1** transforms into **3**, and combined, they make **4**.
**4** transforms into **12**, and combined, they make **16**.

Thus, the numerical application is complete at **3** and reaches its limit at **6**, while the numerical substance is complete at **4** and reaches its limit at **16**.

Hence, the circle—with a diameter of **1** and a circumference of **3**—begins at **1** and accumulates to **6**.
The square—dividing **1** into **4**, and **4** into **16**—follows the natural Way.

**1** acts upon **2** to produce **3**; **3**, discarding **1**, leaves **2**.
**3** generates **9**; **9**, discarding **1**, leaves **8**; discarding **3**, leaves **6**.
Thus, **1** acts upon **3**, and **3** in turn acts upon **2**.
**3** acts upon **9**, and **9** in turn acts upon **8** and **6**.

Therefore, **2** generates **4**, **8** generates **16**, and **6** generates **12**.
**3** combined with **1** makes **4**; **9** combined with **3** makes **12**; **12** combined with **4** makes **16**#29.
Thus, **4** takes **1** as its root and **3** as its application,
**12** takes **3** as its root and **9** as its application,
**16** takes **4** as its root and **12** as its application#30.
Reflect further.

Yang is exalted and divine.
Exalted, it acts upon things; divine, it conceals its application.
Thus, the Way gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and all things yet does not reveal itself.
Heaven, Earth, and all things take their pattern from the Way.

Yang is the Way’s application; Yin is the Way’s substance.
Yang uses Yin, and Yin uses Yang.
To use Yang as application is to exalt Yin;
to use Yin as application is to exalt Yang.
Yin is nearly the Way itself, hence it is likened to the Way.

**6** transformations yield **36**#31,
**8** transformations yield **64**,
**12** transformations yield **384**.
**6×6** transformations yield **36**, progressing to **360**;
**8×8** transformations yield **64**, progressing to **384**.
**8×8** transformations, **7×7** yielding **49**, progress to **384**.
The circle—**6** transformations—**6×6** advancing yields **60** to **360**.
The square—**8** transformations—**8×8** yields **64**.
Yang governs advancement, hence the progression is **60**.
The circle is the stars.
Does the numerical sequence of calendrical cycles originate here?
The square is Earth.
Does the method of dividing states and fields imitate this?

The circle is the numbers of the *Hé Tú* [River Diagram].
The square is the pattern of the *Luó Shū* [Luo Scripture].
Thus, the *Xī* and *Wén* [Sacrificial and Cultural Kings] followed this to create the *Yì* [Changes],
and Yú and Jī [Emperors] expounded it to compose the *Fàn* [Calendrical System].

Why does the *shū* [divination] count use **7** instead of **6**?
It includes the remaining portion.
Discarding the remainder leaves **6**, hence the tally is **36**.
Thus, **50** is the tally for a **64**-year intercalary cycle.
Its application is **49**, the tally for a **64**-coined year.
Returning the odd tally of **1** is like the year’s intercalary month.
Why does the tally subtract **4**?
Heaven transforms, and Earth follows it.
Thus, when the *shū* discards **1**, the tally discards **4**.

The circle—diameter **1**, circumference **3**—doubled yields **6**.
The square—diameter **1**, perimeter **4**—doubled yields **8**.
To trim the square into the circle is Heaven’s movement.
To divide the great into the small is Earth’s transformation.
Thus, Heaven uses **6** transformations, Earth uses **4**.

**1×8** makes **9**, trimmed to **7**;
**8** trimmed makes **6**;
**16** trimmed makes **12**;
**24** trimmed makes **18**;
**32** trimmed makes **24**;
**40** trimmed makes **30**;
**48** trimmed makes **36**;
**56** trimmed makes **42**;
**64** trimmed makes **48**.

**1** divided yields **4**;
**8** divided yields **32**;
**16** divided yields **64**;
up to **96** divided yields **384**.

**1** generates **6**, **6** generates **12**, **12** generates **18**, **18** generates **24**, **24** generates **30**, **30** generates **36**—extended, **60** transformations yield **360**.
This is the number of movement.

**4** generates **12**, **12** generates **20**, **20** generates **28**, **28** generates **36**.
This is the number of generation.

Thus, the *Qián* [Creative] tally is **36** (Yang),
*Duì* [Joyous], *Lí* [Clinging], and *Sūn* [Gentle] tallies are **28** (Yang),
*Zhèn* [Thunderous], *Kǎn* [Abysmal], and *Gèn* [Mountainous] tallies are **20** (Yang),
*Kūn* [Receptive] tally is **12** (Yang).

The circle—**1** transformation yields **6**; discarding **1** leaves **5**.
**2** transformations yield **12**; discarding **2** leaves **10**.
**3** transformations yield **18**; discarding **3** leaves **15**.
**4** transformations yield **24**; discarding **4** leaves **20**.
**5** transformations yield **30**; discarding **5** leaves **25**.
**6** transformations yield **36**; discarding **6** leaves **30**.
Thus, retaining them yields **6×6**, discarding them yields **5×5**.
**5** retains **4** and **1**,
**4** retains **3** and **1**,
**2** retains **1** and **1**.

Thus, **1** generates **2**; discarding **1** leaves **1**.
**2** generates **3**; discarding **1** leaves **2**.
**3** generates **4**; discarding **1** leaves **3**.
**4** generates **5**; discarding **1** leaves **4**.
Hence, **2** takes **1** as its root,
**3** takes **2** as its root,
**4** takes **3** as its root,
**5** takes **4** as its root,
**6** takes **5** as its root.

Reflect further.
The square—**1** transformation yields **4**,
**4** generates **8**, combined with **4** makes **12**.
**8** generates **12**, combined with **8** makes **20**.
**12** generates **16**, combined with **12** makes **28**.
**16** generates **20**, combined with **16** makes **36**.
**1** generates **3**, combined makes **4**.

「十二生二十，并而为三十二也。
**12** generates **20**, combined makes **32**.

二十八生三十六，并而为六十四也。
**28** generates **36**, combined makes **64**.

更思之。

五与四四，去卦一之数，则四八三十二也。
**Five** and **fourfold four**, **discarding one** from the **hexagram count**, then **48** makes **32**.」

**Nine** and **eightfold eight**, **discarding one** from the **hexagram count**, then **46** makes **24**.

**Five** and **eightfold eight**, **nine** and **fourfold eight**, **discarding one** from the **hexagram count**, then **45** makes **20**.

**Nine** and **fourfold four**, **five** and **fourfold eight**, **discarding one** from the **hexagram count**, then **44** makes **16**.

Thus, **discarding the counts of three, four, five, and six**, the **stalk counts** are established as **nine, eight, seven, and six**.

Heaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten—**paired and varied**, their numbers interwoven.

As Heaven and Earth interlock, and day and night alternate.

**One** is the origin of numbers, yet it is not a number itself.

Thus, **two twos make four**, **three threes make nine**, **four fours make sixteen**, **five fives make twenty-five**, **six sixes make thirty-six**, **seven sevens make forty-nine**, **eight eights make sixty-four**, **nine nines make eighty-one**, yet **one** remains unchanging.

A hundred is **ten**, and ten is **one**—also unchanging.

Hence, numbers **discard one** and reach their limit at **nine**, all relying on their **changes**.

**Five fives** make **twenty-five**, the **Heavenly count**.
**Six sixes** make **thirty-six**, the **Qián stalk count**.
**Seven sevens** make **forty-nine**, the **Great Expanse’s operational count**.
**Eight eights** make **sixty-four**, the **hexagram count**.
**Nine nines** make **eighty-one**, the **Mysterious and Ranging counts**.

The **Great Expanse’s count**—is it not the origin of calculation?

Thus, the rise of calculation does not exceed **square, round, straight, and curved**.

**Yin lacks one**, **Yang lacks ten**.

**Multiplication** generates numbers; **division** consumes them.
Though calculation methods are many, they do not depart from this.

Yang obtains Yin and generates; Yin obtains Yang and completes.
Thus, the **stalk count** is **four and nine**, the **hexagram count** is **four and ten**.

Like **Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches** interweaving—Heavenly Stems end at **six**, while Earthly Branches end at **five**.

**Three fours** make **twelve**; **two sixes** also make **twelve**.
**Two twelves** make **twenty-four**; **three eights** also make **twenty-four**; **four sixes** also make **twenty-four**.

**Three twelves** make **thirty-six**; **four nines** also make **thirty-six**; **six sixes** also make **thirty-six**.

**Four twelves** make **forty-eight**; **three sixteens** also make **forty-eight**; **six eights** also make **forty-eight**.

**Five twelves** make **sixty**; **three twenties** also make **sixty**; **six tens** also make **sixty**.
All these are **naturally harmonious**.

**Four nines** make **thirty-six**; **six sixes** make **thirty-six**—**Yang six** and **half of Yin six**, hence **nine**.
Thus, **six** in speech represents **three Yin and three Yang**.

In terms of **three trigrams**, **Heaven, Earth, and Man** each have three.
Yin and Yang each contain **Heaven, Earth, and Man**; **Heaven, Earth, and Man** each contain Yin and Yang—
hence, **three Heavenly, two Earthly**, and **leaning on numbers**.

Once the **Great Polarity** divides, the **Two Principles** stand.
Yang beneath intermingles with Yin; Yin above intermingles with Yang—**four symbols** arise.
Yang intermingles with Yin, Yin intermingles with Yang—**Heaven’s four symbols** emerge.
The firm intermingles with the yielding, the yielding intermingles with the firm—**Earth’s four symbols** arise.

Thus, the **eight trigrams** are complete.
When the **eight trigrams** interweave, then **ten thousand things** are born.

Hence: **One divides into two**, **two divide into four**, **four divide into eight**, **eight divide into sixteen**, **sixteen divide into thirty-two**, **thirty-two divide into sixty-four**.

Thus it is said: **Dividing Yin, dividing Yang**, alternately applying yielding and firm—
**shifting six positions** to form the **sequence**.

**Ten divides into a hundred**, a hundred divides into a thousand, a thousand divides into ten thousand—
like a **root** having a **stem**, a **stem** having **branches**, **branches** having **leaves**—
the greater grows fewer, the finer grows more abundant.
**Uniting**, it becomes **one**; **expanding**, it becomes **ten thousand**.

Thus, **Qián divides**, **Kūn gathers**, **Zhèn extends**, **Xùn diminishes**.
Extending divides, dividing diminishes, diminishing gathers.

**Qián and Kūn** are fixed in position; **Zhèn and Xùn** are a single exchange; **Duì, Lǐ, Kǎn, Gèn** are double exchanges.

Thus, **Zhèn** has little Yang and much Yin; **Xùn** has little Yin and much Yang.
**Duì and Lǐ** grow increasingly Yang; **Kǎn and Gèn** grow increasingly Yin.
Hence, **Chen (Earthly Branch 4)** and **Fire** are unseen.

When **one qi divides**, Yin and Yang are distinguished—
those with more Yang become **Heaven**, those with more Yin become **Earth**.

Thus, when Yin and Yang are balanced, **form and substance** are complete;
when Yin and Yang are uneven, **nature and disposition** are divided.

When **form and substance** are divided, the more Yang becomes **firm**, the more Yin becomes **yielding**.
When **nature and disposition** are further divided, the more Yang reaches **Yang’s extreme**, the more Yin reaches **Yin’s extreme**.

**Duì, Lǐ, and Xùn** possess much Yang; **Gèn, Kǎn, and Zhèn** possess much Yin—
these are used for **Heaven and Earth’s functions**.

**Qián** is the extreme of Yang, **Kūn** the extreme of Yin—
thus, they are **not used** in exchange.

**Qián** takes one from its four parts to give to **Kūn**; **Kūn** takes one from its four parts to repay **Qián**.
When **Qián and Kūn** combine, they generate **six children**—
three sons, all Yang; three daughters, all Yin.

**Duì** divides one Yang to give to **Gèn**; **Kǎn** divides one Yin to repay **Lǐ**.
**Zhèn and Xùn** exchange two—
in total, Yin and Yang are balanced.
Thus, **Water and Fire** generate and conquer each other,
and only then are **ten thousand things** fully formed.

The **names and positions** of **Qián and Kūn** cannot be exchanged;
the **names** of **Kǎn and Lǐ** can be exchanged, but their **positions** cannot;
the **positions** of **Zhèn and Xùn** can be exchanged, but their **names** cannot;
the **names and positions** of **Duì and Gèn** can both be exchanged.

**Li** resembles **Qián**#38, **Kǎn** resembles **Kūn**; **Zhōng Fǎ** resembles **Qián**, **Yí** resembles **Lí**, **Xiǎo Guò** resembles **Kūn**, **Dà Guò** resembles **Kǎn**.
Thus, **Qián, Kūn, Lí, Kǎn, Zhōng Fǎ, Yí, Dà Guò, Xiǎo Guò**—all are unchangeable in their essence.

**Lí** is in Heaven yet aligns with night, hence Yang contains Yin within it.
**Kǎn** is on Earth yet aligns with day, hence Yin contains Yang within it.
**Zhèn** begins by engaging Yin while Yang emerges; **Xùn** begins by diminishing Yang while Yin arises.
**Duì** is the extension of Yang; **Gèn** is the extension of Yin.
**Zhèn and Duì** belong to Heaven’s Yin; **Xùn and Gèn** belong to Earth’s Yang.
Thus, **Zhèn and Duì** are Yin above and Yang below, while **Xùn and Gèn** are Yang above and Yin below.
When speaking of Heaven’s origin, Yin is placed above and Yang below—this is the principle of *Jiāo Tài*.
When speaking of Earth’s completion, Yang is placed above and Yin below—this is the order of rank and status.
**Qián and Kūn** establish the positions of above and below; **Lí and Kǎn** arrange the gates of left and right.
They are the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth, the rising and setting of the sun and moon.
Thus, the four seasons, the phases of the moon, the length of day and night, and the movements of celestial bodies—all arise from this.

Before the **Wú Jí**, Yin contained Yang.
After the emergence of forms, Yang divided Yin.
Yin is the mother of Yang#39, and Yang is the father of Yin.
Thus, the mother conceives the eldest son, giving rise to **Fù**#40,
and the father begets the eldest daughter, giving rise to **Gòu**.
Hence, the intestines originate from **Fù**, and Yin arises from **Gòu**.

Nature cannot form without substance, and substance cannot generate without nature.
Yang takes Yin as its substance, and Yin takes Yang as its nature.
Motion is nature; stillness is substance.
In Heaven, Yang moves while Yin remains still; on Earth, Yang remains still while Yin moves.
Nature, finding substance, becomes still; substance, following nature, moves.
Thus, Yang expands while Yin hastens.

Examined further:
Yang cannot stand alone; it must obtain Yin to establish itself, hence Yang relies on Yin as its foundation.
Yin cannot manifest itself; it must await Yang to reveal itself, hence Yin depends on Yang as its initiator.
Yang knows its beginning and enjoys its completion; Yin follows its method and fulfills its function#41.
Yang can know and see, while Yin cannot know or see.
That which can know and see is *You* (having); thus, Yang’s nature is *You*, and Yin’s nature is *Wú* (non-being).
Yang has what it does not exhaust, while Yin exhausts all it encompasses.
Yang has a constant dwelling even when departing from Yin#42.
That which is not exhausted and remains constant is *Shí* (real).
Thus, Yang’s substance is empty, while Yin’s substance is real.

Rising from below is called *ascending*; descending from above is called *descending*.
Ascending is generation; descending is dissipation.
Thus, Yang generates from below, while Yin generates from above.
Hence, all things return to their origins.
Yin generates Yang, Yang generates Yin, Yin again generates Yang, Yang again generates Yin.
Thus, it cycles endlessly without exhaustion.

The foundation of Heaven and Earth originates from the Center#43.
Hence, **Qián and Kūn**, though ever-changing, never depart from the Center.
Humans dwell within Heaven and Earth; the heart dwells within humans.
At midday, vitality is at its peak; at midmonth, the moon is full.
Thus, the virtuous person values the Center.

Its root is **qi**; when generated, it becomes Yang; when dissipated, it becomes Yin.
Thus, the two are in fact one.
The six are in fact three.
The eight are in fact four.
Hence, one speaks of Heaven without mentioning Earth,
of the sovereign without mentioning the subject,
of the father without mentioning the son,
of the husband without mentioning the wife.
Yet Heaven obtains Earth, and all things are born;
the sovereign obtains the subject, and all transformations proceed;
the father obtains the son, the husband obtains the wife, and the family’s way is established.
Thus, one leads to two, two to four, three to six, four to eight.
Yin and Yang generate and divide into the **Two Forms** (*Èr Yí*);
the **Two Forms** interact and generate the **Four Symbols** (*Sì Xiàng*);
the **Four Symbols** interact and form the **Eight Trigrams** (*Bā Guà*);
the **Eight Trigrams** interact and generate the **Ten Thousand Things**.
Thus, the **Two Forms** generate the categories of Heaven and Earth,
the **Four Symbols** define the substance of Heaven and Earth.
The **Four Symbols** generate the categories of the **Eight Trigrams**,
the **Eight Trigrams** define the substance of sun and moon.
The **Eight Trigrams** generate the categories of all things,
superimposed trigrams define the substance of all things.
Categories are the sequence of generation;
substance is the interaction of forms.
To trace categories, one must begin with generation;
to observe substance, one must proceed through forms.
Generation is the reverse projection of what is yet to come;
forms are the forward observation of what is already complete.
Thus, the sun and moon belong to the same category—
they emerge from the same source yet occupy different positions,
occupy different positions yet share the same form.
Extending this principle, how can any thing escape?

Heaven changes with time, and Earth responds to things;
when time changes, Yin varies while Yang responds#44;
when things change, darkness varies while Yang responds.
Thus, time can be known in reverse, while things must be observed in their completion.
Hence, Yang advances while Yin follows, Yin opposes while Yang conforms#45.
Speaking of substance, Heaven divides to become Earth,
Earth divides to become all things,
yet the **Dao** cannot be divided.
In the end, all things return to Earth,
Earth returns to Heaven,
Heaven returns to the **Dao**.
Thus, the virtuous person values the **Dao**.

Where there is change, there must be response.
Thus, change within corresponds to response without,
change without corresponds to response within,
change below corresponds to response above,
change above corresponds to response below.
Heaven changes, and the sun responds to it;
thus, change follows Heaven, while response follows the sun.
Hence, the sun is measured by stars,
the moon converges with the celestial stems,
water is born from soil,
fire lies dormant in stone.
Birds alight on trees, beasts rely on grass,
the heart and lungs are interconnected,
the liver and gallbladder are paired.
There is no other reason—it is the way of response to change.
What originates from Heaven is close to above,
what originates from Earth is close to below.
Thus, change and response are always in opposition.

Yang interacts with Yin, and thus produces creatures of the hoof and horn variety.
Just as **yang** interacts with **gai** (柔, softness), creatures of the root and vine kind emerge.
When Yin interacts with Yang, beings of feather and wing arise.
When **gai** (柔) interacts with **gang** (刚, hardness), creatures of branch and trunk are born.

Heaven interacts with Earth, and Earth interacts with Heaven.
Thus, there are beings with feathers yet that walk,
and those with feet yet that soar—
grass contains wood, and wood contains grass.

Extending this by their respective kinds,
the varieties of living things are exhausted.

Walkers are suited to the lower realms,
fliers to the upper—
this is their natural inclination.

Land-dwelling creatures must have aquatic counterparts,
just as shadows mirror forms.
Land abounds with walkers,
water with fliers—
this is the principle of interaction.

Therefore, what is vast on land must be refined in water,
and what is vast in water must be refined on land.

The fur of tigers and leopards is akin to grass,
the feathers of eagles and kites akin to wood.
Wood, being the offspring of stars,
thus mirrors their fruit.

Leaves are Yin,
blossoms and fruit are Yang.
Branches and leaves are delicate,
while roots and trunks are firm.

In humans, bones are vast and bodies complex,
in trees, trunks are vast and leaves abundant—
this reflects the patterns of Heaven and Earth.

The mobile have horizontal bodies,
the rooted have vertical bodies,
yet humans, suited for horizontality, grow vertically instead.

Fliers have wings,
walkers have claws.
Humans’ two hands are like wings,
two feet are like claws.

Fliers feed on wood,
walkers on grass.
Humans partake of both,
and also consume what flies and walks.
Thus, humans are the most honored of all creatures.

Bodies must interact to generate life.
Hence, Yang interacting with **gang** (刚) produces the heart and lungs,
Yang interacting with **gai** (柔) produces the liver and gallbladder,
**Gai** (柔) interacting with Yin produces the kidneys and bladder,
**Gang** (刚) interacting with Yin produces the spleen and stomach.

The heart generates the eyes,
the gallbladder generates the ears,
the spleen generates the nose,
the kidneys generate the mouth,
the lungs generate bones,
the liver generates flesh,
the stomach generates marrow,
the bladder generates blood.
Thus,
**Qian** (乾) corresponds to the heart,
**Dui** (兑) to the spleen,
**Li** (离) to the gallbladder,
**Zhen** (震) to the kidneys,
**Kun** (坤) to blood,
**Gen** (艮) to flesh,
**Kan** (坎) to marrow,
**Xun** (巽) to bones,
**Tai** (泰) to the eyes,
**Zhong Fu** (中孚) to the nose,
**Ji Ji** (既济) to the ears,
**Yi** (颐) to the mouth,
**Da Guo** (大过) to the lungs,
**Wei Ji** (未济) to the stomach,
**Xiao Guo** (小过) to the liver,
**Pi** (否) to the bladder.

Heaven and Earth possess eight **xiàng** (象, manifestations),
humans possess sixteen—
why so?

Because humans are born from the union of Heaven and Earth,
and children from the union of father and mother,
thus there are sixteen **xiàng**.

Why does the heart reside within the lungs,
and the gallbladder within the liver?
Because when speaking of **nature** (性), one must attribute it to Heaven,
and when speaking of **form** (体), one must attribute it to Earth.
Earth contains Heaven,
stone contains fire—
thus, the heart and gallbladder mirror these.

The heart and gallbladder hang inverted—
why?
Because humans and grasses grow in reverse,
thus they are inverted.

The mouth and eyes are horizontal,
the nose is vertical—
why?
Because bodies must interact,
so the mobile should be vertical yet are horizontal,
while the rooted should be horizontal yet are vertical—
all by interaction.

Heaven has four seasons,
Earth has four directions,
humans have four limbs.
Thus,
finger joints can measure the seasons,
palm veins can discern the Earth’s regions.
The principles of Heaven and Earth are complete within fingers and palms.
Can they not be honored?

The **shén** (神, spirit) is governed by the heart,
**qì** (气) by the kidneys,
**xíng** (形, form) by the head.
Form and **qì** interact,
while the spirit presides within—
the Dao of the Three Powers.

Humans’ four limbs each possess veins.
One vein has three sections,
one section has three **hòu** (候, phases),
to correspond with Heaven’s cycles.

The heart stores the spirit,
the kidneys store the essence,
the spleen stores the **hún** (魂, ethereal soul),
the gallbladder stores the **pò** (魄, corporeal soul).
The stomach receives nourishment and transforms it,
transmitting **qì** to the lungs,
transmitting blood to the liver,
and transmitting water and grains to the intestines.

Heaven is round and Earth is square—
Heaven is high in the south and low in the north,
so when viewed, it seems like leaning against a canopy.
Earth is low in the east and southeast,
high in the west and northwest,
so the east and southeast abound in water,
while the west and northwest abound in mountains.

Heaven covers Earth,
Earth bears Heaven—
Heaven and Earth embrace one another.
Thus, Heaven above contains Earth,
and Earth below contains Heaven.

Heaven is vast and unfathomable above,
so one observes the **Dǒu** (斗, Big Dipper) to measure celestial cycles.
Where the Dipper is positioned,
Heaven’s motion is revealed.

**Kui** (魁) aligns with **Zǐ** (子),
**Cūn** (村) aligns with **Yín** (寅),
and stars take **Yín** as the mark of day.

The Dipper has seven stars,
so the day does not exceed seven parts.

Examining this further:
Heaven’s motion determines day and night,
the sun’s motion determines cold and heat.

Summer is shallow, winter is deep—
this is the interaction of Heaven and Earth.
Leftward rotation, rightward progression—
this is the interaction of Heaven and sun.

The sun rises in the east in the morning,
sets in the west in the evening—
following Heaven’s motion.
Summer is in the north,
winter is in the south—
following Heaven’s interaction.

Heaven completes one cycle,
and the Dipper ascends one star—
corresponding with the sun’s progression.
Spring aligns with **Yǒu** (酉),
summer with **Wǔ** (午),
autumn with **Mǎo** (卯),
winter with **Zǐ** (子)—
corresponding with the sun’s interaction.

The sun advances by delay,
the moon retreats by haste—
when sun and moon converge,
they add or subtract half a day,
thus creating the **rùn yú** (闰余, surplus intercalary months).

In one great cycle,
the sun advances six days,
the moon retreats six days—
thus creating the **rùn chā** (闰差, differential intercalary months).

When the sun traverses Yang degrees, it waxes;
when it traverses Yin degrees, it wanes—
this is the Dao of guest and host.

When the moon moves away from the sun,
its light is born and it slows—
when it nears the sun,
its darkness is born and it hastens—
this is the principle of sovereign and subject.

When Yang is diminished,
Yin arises—
thus, the sun descends while the moon rises in the west.
When Yin is dominant,
it opposes Yang—
thus, at fullness, the moon rises in the east.

Heaven is the father,
the sun is the son—
so Heaven rotates leftward,
while the sun moves rightward.
The sun is the husband,
the moon is the wife—
so the sun rises in the east,
while the moon is born in the west.

When sun and moon eclipse one another,
it is the convergence of their cycles.
When the sun is full,
the moon eclipses—
when the moon conceals the sun,
the sun eclipses.

Just as wood and fire mutually restrain each other,
therefore the sage employs wisdom,
while the petty man relies on brute force.

The sun revolves with Heaven,
the moon moves with the sun,
the stars appear with the moon.
Thus, the stars follow the moon,
the moon follows the sun,
the sun follows Heaven.

Heaven is half bright, half dark;
the sun is half full, half diminished;
the moon is half full, half waned;
the stars are half moving, half still—
this is the principle of Yin and Yang.

Heaven is always visible day and night.
The sun appears by day,
the moon appears by night—yet half is unseen,
the stars appear half by night—
this reflects the hierarchy of noble and base.

The moon can be seen by day,
so it is Yin within Yang.
The stars can be seen by night,
so they are Yang within Yin.

Heaven is singular, Earth is paired,
thus those who study celestial omens observe only the stars,
while those who examine terrestrial patterns observe only mountains and waters.
By observing the stars, the body of Heaven is revealed;
by observing mountains and waters, the body of Earth is revealed.
Heaven’s body contains all things,
Earth’s body bears all things.
Thus, their forms approach the Dao.

At the southern extreme, there is great heat;
at the northern extreme, there is great cold.
Thus, the south melts while the north congeals—
this is the death-ground of all things.

In summer, the sun follows the Big Dipper northward;
in winter, the sun follows the Big Dipper southward.
Thus, Heaven and Earth interact, and cold and heat harmonize,
and when cold and heat harmonize, all things flourish.

Heaven’s virtue is in its rigidity,
so the yielding does not appear.
Earth’s nature is in its yielding,
so the rigid does not arise.
Thus, *Zhen* (thunder) is Heaven’s Yang,
*Xun* (wind) is Earth’s Yang.
Earth is Yin;
when there is Yang, Yin responds to it.
Thus, the most extreme Yin is *Chen* (the hour),
the most extreme Yang is the sun.
All belong to Heaven,
while Earth is but water and fire.
Thus, all things on Earth have form.
When Yin conceals Yang, form and substance arise;
when Yang conceals Yin, nature and disposition arise.
Thus, Yang generates Yin,
Yin generates Yang,
Yang restrains Yin,
Yin restrains Yang.
What cannot be concealed of Yang does not appear on Earth;
what cannot be restrained of Yin does not appear in Heaven.
Where Yang is minimally concealed, its form must be yielding,
thus it fears Yang and is used by Yang.
Where Yang is maximally concealed, its form must be rigid,
thus it overcomes Yang and is used by Yin.
Hence, water and fire move with Yang,
while soil and stone remain still with Yin.

Yang generates Yin, so water forms first.
Yin generates Yang, so fire forms later—
this is the mutual generation of Yin and Yang.
Thus, when Yang departs, Yin is exhausted,
when Yin is spent, Yang perishes.
Metal and fire cling together and flow,
fire and wood assist each other and burn—
this follows their kind.
Water meets cold and congeals,
meets fire and is exhausted—
this follows their victory.

Yang obtains Yin and becomes rain,
Yin obtains Yang and becomes wind.
The rigid obtains the yielding and becomes clouds,
the yielding obtains the rigid and becomes thunder.
Without Yin, rain cannot form;
without Yang, thunder cannot strike.
Rain is yielding and belongs to Yin.
Yin cannot act alone,
so it awaits Yang before manifesting.
Thunder is rigid and belongs to the body.
The body cannot act of itself,
so it must await Yang before erupting.

Where there is intention, there must be speech;
where there is speech, there must be form;
where there is form, there must be number.
Numbers established, forms arise;
forms arise, speech becomes clear;
speech is clear, intention is revealed.
Forms and numbers are the traps and snares,
speech and intention are the fish and rabbits.
To obtain the fish and rabbits while forgetting the traps is acceptable,
but to seek the fish and rabbits through the traps alone is to fail.

Heaven changes, and humanity follows—
thus *Elemental, Prosperous, Auspicious, Steadfast* are the changes of the *Yijing*.
Humanity acts, and Heaven responds—
thus *auspicious, inauspicious, regret, and caution* are the responses of the *Yijing*.
To take *Elemental, Prosperous* as change,
then *Auspicious, Steadfast* are the response.
To take *auspicious, inauspicious* as response,
then *regret, caution* are the change.
*Elemental* leads to *auspicious*,
*auspicious* responds with *Prosperous*.
*Prosperous* leads to *inauspicious*,
*inauspicious* responds with *Steadfast*.
*Regret* leads to *auspicious*,
*caution* leads to *inauspicious*.
Thus, within change there is response,
and within response there is change.
The response within change is the Way of Heaven—
thus, *Elemental* as change,
then *Prosperous* responds to it.
*Auspicious* as change,
then it is responded to with *Steadfast*.
The change within response is human affairs—
thus, change leads to *inauspicious*,
response leads to *auspicious*.
Change leads to *caution*,
response leads to *regret*.
*Regret* is the omen of *auspicious*,
*caution* is the root of *inauspicious*.
Thus, the sage follows Heaven, not humanity.

*Elemental* is spring, is benevolence.
Spring is the beginning of time,
benevolence is the longest of virtues.
Though time is not yet at its peak,
virtue suffices to nourish all—
thus, virtue is spoken of, not time.

*Prosperous* is summer, is propriety.
Summer is the peak of time,
propriety is the adornment of virtue.
Peak must decline,
and adornment cannot save it—
thus, time is spoken of, not virtue.
Hence it is said:
*"Great is the primal power of Qian,
yet the ninth hexagram brings regret."*

*Auspicious* is autumn, is righteousness.
Autumn is the completion of time,
righteousness is the measure of virtue.
When all things are nearing completion,
those who gain righteousness do not understand profit—
thus, time is spoken of, not virtue.

*Steadfast* is winter, is wisdom.
Winter is the end of time,
wisdom is the decline of virtue.
*Steadfast* is auspicious,
the un-*steadfast* is inauspicious—
thus, virtue is spoken of, not time.

Hence it is said:
*"Auspicious and steadfast—
this is nature and disposition."*
Truly profound was King Wen’s composition of the *Yijing*!
He grasped the functions of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* interact to form *Tai* (Peace),
*Kan* and *Li* interact to form *Ji* (Completion).
*Qian* is born at *zi* (child),
*Kun* is born at *wu* (noon),
*Kan* ends at *yin* (tiger),
*Li* ends at *shen* (monkey)—
this corresponds to Heaven’s seasons.
Place *Qian* in the northwest,
retreat *Kun* to the southwest,
let the eldest son govern while the eldest daughter replaces the mother,
*Kan* and *Li* secure their positions,
*Xuan* (joy) and *Gen* (mountain) form pairs—
this corresponds to Earth’s directions.

The sovereign’s law is exhausted here.

*Qian* and *Kun*—the roots of Heaven and Earth.
*Li* and *Kan*—the functions of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, the *Yijing* begins with *Qian* and *Kun*,
proceeds through *Li* and *Kan*,
and concludes with *Ji* (Completion) and *Weiji* (Uncompleted).
*Tai* (Peace) and *Pi* (Opposition) form the center of the Upper Scriptures,
while *Xian* (Adherence) and *Heng* (Duration) open the Lower Scriptures—
all speaking to their functions.

*Kun* governs the three daughters in the southwest,
*Qian* governs the three sons in the northeast.
The Upper Scriptures commence with three,
the Lower Scriptures conclude with four—
all embodying the principle of mutual *Tai* (Peace).

Thus, the *Yijing* is the *use* of things.
*Qian* employs nine, *Kun* employs six,
the Great Unfolding employs forty-nine—
yet the hidden dragon is not to be used.

Great indeed is this *use*!
Here I perceive the Sage’s heart.

The Dao generates Heaven,
Heaven generates Earth,
and when their work is complete, they withdraw—
thus the son succeeds the father in the abdication.
Hence *Qian* retreats one position.

*Qian* and *Kun* interact to form *Tai* (Peace),
and transform into the miscellaneous hexagrams.

*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are the functions of the Upper Section,
*Xuan* (Joy), *Gen* (Mountain), *Zhen* (Thunder), and *Xun* (Wind) those of the Lower Section.

*Yi* (Nourishment), *Zhongfu* (Sincerity), *Daguo* (Excess), and *Xiaoguo* (Moderate Excess) are the proper themes of the three sections.

The *Yijing* is the interplay of one *yin* and one *yang*.

*Zhen* and *Xuan* are the first to interact,
thus they occupy the morning and evening positions.

*Li* and *Kan* reach their extreme interaction,
thus they occupy the *zi* (child) and *wu* (noon) positions.

*Xun* and *Gen*, though not directly interacting, still blend *yin* and *yang*,
thus they occupy the intermediate positions.

*Qian* and *Kun* are pure *yang* and *yin*,
thus they occupy the unused positions.

*Qian* and *Kun* are vertical, while the six children are horizontal—
this is the foundation of the *Yijing*.

*Zhen* and *Xuan* are horizontal, while the six hexagrams are vertical—
this is the *use* of the *Yijing*.

Symbols arise from form,
numbers from substance.
Names arise from speech,
meaning from *use*.

The principles of the world emerge from *li* (pattern),
and when they deviate from *li*, they fall into *shu* (technique).
Men of the world enter through numbers into technique,
thus losing the *li*.

All things under Heaven are achieved through the Dao,
then neither joy nor sorrow can reach them.

Heaven’s *yang* lies in the south, its *yin* in the north,
Earth’s *yin* lies in the south, its *yang* in the north,
Man’s *yang* is above, his *yin* below—
yet when they interact, *yang* descends and *yin* ascends.

Heaven’s principles are exhausted in *li* and cannot be fully captured by form—
yet the *huntian* (Celestial Globe) technique exhausts Heaven through form.
Is this permissible?

The twelve *chen* (celestial stems) and *zi* (earthly branches) intersect,
forming the *chen*—
the body of Heaven.
Heaven’s body is the *qi* of formlessness.
To penetrate its profound meaning and reach its essence is to achieve *use*.

Without penetrating the profound meaning, one cannot enter the essence,
and without entering the essence, one cannot achieve *use*.

The way of governance must grasp transformation—
it cannot be rigid like glue on a pillar,
nor can spring’s commands be issued in winter.

The *yang* number is one, unfolding into ten—
as in the ten thousand things.
The *yin* number is two, unfolding into twelve—
as in the twelve branches and twelve months.

The virtues of *Yuan* (Origin), *Li* (Nurturance), *He* (Harmony), and *Zhen* (Steadfastness)
each contain the affairs of *xiang* (disaster), *hui* (regret), and *lin* (stagnation).
Though one acts in virtue,
if it conflicts with the time, misfortune may still arise.

The first and upper trigrams are alike,
yet the upper does not advance as far as the first.
The second and fifth trigrams are alike,
yet the second’s *yin* within does not match the fifth’s *yang* within.
The third and fourth trigrams are alike,
yet the third is at the top of the lower hexagram,
while the fourth is closer to the fifth.

Heaven’s *yang* is in the south, hence the sun resides there.
Earth’s firmness is in the north, hence the mountain resides there.
Thus, Earth is high in the northwest,
and Heaven is high in the southeast.

Heaven’s spirit dwells in the sun,
man’s spirit dwells in the eyes.
When man’s spirit is awake, it dwells in the heart,
when asleep, it dwells in the kidneys—
thus mirroring Heaven,
this is the way of day and night.

Clouds move and rain falls,
lightning flashes and thunder shakes—
all follow their kind.

*Chui* (blowing), *pen* (spitting), *xu* (breathing), *he* (shouting)
correspond to wind, rain, clouds, and mist—
all must harmonize.

All things follow the sequence of *Taiji* (Supreme Ultimate), *Liangyi* (Two Complements), *Sisxiang* (Four Symbols), and *Bagua* (Eight Trigrams),
and also bear the symbols of antiquity and modernity.

Clouds contain the essences of water, fire, earth, and stone—
their transformations are likewise.

The distance between the two solstices,
east to west, is one hundred eighty degrees,
north to south, sixty degrees.

In the month of the winter solstice, its movement resembles the day of the summer solstice.
In the month of the summer solstice, its movement resembles the day of the winter solstice.

The four cardinals are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*.
Their symbols show no reversing changes—
thus they are called cardinal.

Wood’s branches and earth-stone’s formations
are what makes them unchanging.
Leaves and flowers, formed by water and fire,
thus change and are transient.

What unfolds naturally is Heaven—
only the Sage can trace it.
What is imitated is human—
yet if it follows the timing of stopping and acting,
even man can align with Heaven.

Life is *xing* (nature)—Heaven.
Form is *xing* (form)—Earth.
The sun entering the earth is the symbol of *gouxing* (embryonic refinement).

Fourfold in body, sixfold in transformation—
this encompasses both spirit and *qi*.

*Qi* transforms in six ways,
thus there are three hundred sixty.
For all things, when they reach their extreme,
the tenth of the ten is where one should stop.
If, like the summer solstice, one stops at sixty,
and includes the divisions of dawn and dusk,
then it approaches seven-tenths.

East is red, south is white, west is yellow, north is black—
these are the five colors.
They can be verified at dawn, noon, dusk, and night.

Though the diagram has no markings,
I speak of it all day without ever departing from it—
for the principles of Heaven, Earth, and all things
are exhausted within it.

The winter solstice’s *zi* (child) is the extreme of *yin*.
The spring equinox’s *mao* (tiger) is the center of *yang*.
The summer solstice’s *wu* (noon) is the extreme of *yang*.
The autumn equinox’s *you* (monkey) is the center of *yin*.
In all, three hundred sixty—
divided in half, one hundred eighty.

This is the realm of light and darkness in the lamp—
the symbols of the sun and moon.

The moon is the shadow of the sun.
Emotion is the shadow of nature.
The nature of the heart is the courage of the spirit,
the nature of the spirit is the emotion of the ghost.

Water is the earth of fire,
fire is the *qi* of water.
Black is the earth of white.
Cold is the earth of heat.

The heart is the *Taiji* (Supreme Polarity),
or it may be said that the Dao/Way is the *Taiji*.

Form can be divided,
but spirit cannot be divided.

The beasts of the grasslands have fur like clusters of grass,
the birds of the forests have feathers like leaves—
such is their kind.

*Yin* matters occupy more than half,
for *yang* is one and *yin* is two.

After the winter solstice comes *inhalation* (*hu*),
after the summer solstice comes *exhalation* (*xi*).
This is the breathing of Heaven and Earth in one year.

*Huángjí Jīngshì* (The Canon of the Sovereign Polarity), Volume Twelve
Composed by Shao Yaofu of the Three Rivers.

**Volume Twelve of *Huángjí Jīngshì* (The Canon of the Sovereign Polarity), Part Two of *Guānwù Wàipiān* (Observing External Things)**

**With things, one rejoices in things; with things, one laments in things.**
This is the spontaneous yet measured expression.

The blossoming of stone, the dissolving of salt—such are their kinds.
The things of water differ not from the things of land;
each possesses its own nature of cold and heat.

In broad terms, land is **yin within yang**, while water is **yang within yin**.

The sun, moon, stars, and constellations together form the heavens;
water, fire, earth, and stone together form the earth.
Ear, eye, nose, and mouth together form the head;
marrow, blood, bone, and flesh together form the body—
this is the number five.

Fire arises from the **non-existent**, water from the **existing**.
Not acting upon things yet able to transform all things.

When constellations reach the sun, it is **generation**; when the sun reaches constellations, it is **function**.
For what is **顺 (顺顺, in harmony)** is generation, while what is **逆 (against)** is function.

The *Yì* contains **384 lines**—true celestial phenomena.

Eagles and hawks of their kind eat living prey,
while chickens and pheasants do not exclusively so.
Tigers and leopards eat living prey,
while cats and dogs eat both living prey and grains.
By analogy, this may be inferred.

Horses and oxen are both **yin** in kind;
further refined, the horse is **yang**, the ox **yin**.

Birds and insects delight in wind and excel in upward flight,
while quadrupeds delight in earth and excel in downward movement.

The eggs of birds and insects are akin to grains and fruits.
Grains bear many offspring, and so do insects.
Silkworms of their kind—this year moths, next year silkworms.
Turnips of their kind—this year roots and sprouts, next year sprouts and seeds.

The **qi** of heaven and earth shifts:
when it moves from north to south, order prevails;
when it moves from south to north, chaos arises.
Prolonged chaos then reverses, returning north to south.
Thus is the **Dao** of heaven and the affairs of humankind.

Examining past dynasties reveals the principle of **consumption and growth**.

Indulge your desires, and emotions arise;
emotions cloud the mind, leading to confusion.
Follow things, and nature manifests;
nature clarifies the spirit, bringing enlightenment.

Hidden in heaven, hidden in earth—
without action yet arriving, not constrained by yin and yang—this is the **spirit**.

Those in water do not close their eyes;
those in wind do.
Quadrupeds have upper eyelids meeting lower ones,
while birds have lower eyelids meeting upper ones—
this is the nature of their kind.

The scales and bristles of aquatic creatures belong to flying kinds;
turtles and otters belong to walking kinds.

The **Four Symbols**—if combined and applied—
the sun and moon are heaven’s **yin and yang**;
water and fire are earth’s **yin and yang**;
stars and constellations are heaven’s **rigidity and flexibility**;
earth and stone are earth’s **rigidity and flexibility**.

The calamities of heaven—even one in ten may be averted,
but the calamities of humankind—nine in ten cannot be escaped.

**Yang** governs expansion and lengthening;
**yin** governs contraction and urgency.
When the sun enters its full degree, **yin** follows **yang**.
When the moon enters its diminished degree, **yang** follows **yin**.

Flying and walking—chickens and ducks are of this kind.
Walking and flying—dragons and horses are of this kind.

**Pretian (先天) learning** is the **heart**;
**post-tian (后天) learning** is the **trace**.

Emerging from and returning to **wu (non-being)** and **you (being)**—
life and death—this is the **Dao**.

The **spirit** is nowhere yet everywhere.
The **perfected sage** communicates with others’ minds
because they originate from **One**.

The **Dao** and **One**—mighty names for the **spirit**.
To call the **spirit** the **spirit** is the supreme utterance.

The **body** is earth;
its foundation is **stillness**,
yet it moves through the action of **qi** and blood.

Heaven and earth generate ten thousand things;
the sage generates ten thousand people.
**Generative generation**, heaven and earth’s accomplishment.
**Distinctive classification**, the sage’s accomplishment of abilities.

The **spirit** is the master of humankind:
drowsiness begins in the **spleen**,
deep sleep in the **kidneys**,
awakening in the **liver**,
and again in the **gallbladder**,
full awakening in the **heart**.

To observe things through things is **nature**.
To observe things through oneself is **emotion**.
**Nature** is public and clear;
**emotion** is partial and obscure.

**Yang** governs **expansion and emergence**,
**yin** governs **contraction and withdrawal**.
The sun in water **lives**; separated, it **dies**—
this is the meaning of **interaction and non-interaction**.

**Yin** opposes **yang** as two,
yet when **yang** arrives, life follows;
when **yang** departs, death follows.
Thus, heaven and ten thousand things—
life and death governed by **yang**—
return to **One**.

The **spirit** has no fixed form, yet **nature** has substance.
When **nature** manifests, it appears in **emotion**;
when **emotion** manifests, it appears in **form**—
responding by kind.

The great awakening of heaven and earth is in **summer**,
while the **spirit** of humankind resides in the **vital passions**.

Because heaven and earth generate ten thousand things,
one must treat ten thousand things as ten thousand things.
Because the **Dao** generates heaven and earth,
then heaven and earth are also ten thousand things.

The **clan of water** takes **yin** as primary, **yang** secondary.
The **clan of land** takes **yang** as primary, **yin** secondary.
Thus, water creatures die when removed from water,
while wind creatures die when immersed in water.
Yet there are kinds that enter and exit—
turtles, crabs, geese, and ducks are of this kind.

The interaction of heaven and earth—three in ten.
One change yields two,
two changes yield four,
three changes complete the **Eight Trigrams**,
four changes yield sixteen,
five changes yield thirty-two,
six changes complete the **sixty-four hexagrams**.

**Heaven-fire** is fire without form;
**earth-fire** is fire with form.
The nobility of humankind encompasses all kinds.
By esteeming oneself, one attains nobility
and thus can govern all kinds.

In humankind, virtue and vice manifest in speech and action,
only then known by others.
But when they first arise in the heart and manifest in thought,
ghosts and spirits already know them.
This is why the **noble** must be cautious in solitude.

**Qi** transforms, and form changes.
Humankind encompasses the natures of all things.
Fire without form takes form through things.
The fire of metals and stones is fiercer than that of grasses and trees—
this is because of the things themselves.

When **qi** and form flourish, **hun (ethereal soul)** and **pò (corporeal soul)** flourish;
when **qi** and form decline, **hun** and **pò** likewise decline.
The **hun** follows **qi** in transformation,
the **pò** follows form in cessation.

Thus, **form** exists, and **pò** remains;
**form** dissolves, and **pò** disperses.
The **hun** (spirit) of humankind is the **hun** of Heaven and Earth.
Humankind’s self-deception is how one deceives Heaven and Earth—
how can one not be cautious?

Stars are the remnants of the sun,
constellations are the remnants of the moon.
Even the finest stars, like dust and sand,
condense into mounds and hills.
When the mind is unified and undivided,
it can respond without obstruction—
this is why the **noble** maintains a **empty heart** and remains unmoved.

**Concealment** is the movement of Heaven,
**revelation** is the movement of Earth.
When Heaven and Earth move in harmony,
they form the **Eight Trigrams**—
the **sage** benefits creation without self-interest.

In the **bright**, there are the sun and moon;
in the **dark**, there are ghosts and spirits.
The *Yijing* (Classic of Changes) contains **true numbers**—
three in essence.
**Heaven’s** threefold trinity yields nine;
**Earth’s** doubling of three yields six.
The **Eight Trigrams**, when interwoven,
become sixty-four hexagrams.

The *Yijing*’s foundation lies in **Qián (Heaven)** and **Kūn (Earth)**,
and it flourishes through **Gòu (Encounter)** and **Fù (Return)**.
For **Fù** arises when **yang** meets **yīn**,
and **Gòu** when **yīn** meets **yang**—
from this, endless transformations unfold.

The *Suwen* (Plain Questions) and *Yīnfú* (Secrecy of the Dark),
are texts from the **Seven States**.
The **sage’s** teachings are **wholly complete**, leaving no trace,
like the **Dao** of Heaven itself.
Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records only true events,
where **virtue** and **vice** reveal themselves within.

The **Middle Way**’s principle:
From within, it is **Heaven**;
from without, it is **humankind**.
The **rhythmic laws**:
**Opening and closing** follow the **Lǚ (Heaven’s Music)**,
**clarity and turbidity** follow the **Lǜ (Earth’s Music)**.
The **rhythmic laws**:
First closing, then opening—**Spring**;
purely opening—**Summer**;
first opening, then closing—**Autumn**;
**Winter** closes, leaving no sound.
Texts like the *Suwen* and *Mìyǔ* (Secret Speech)
have mastered the **principles of the Way** within **technique**.

**Manifested in benevolence**, **hidden in application**—
Mencius excelled in concealing his application.
**Silent and unmoving**, he returned to the **root** and restored **stillness**,
the time of **Kūn (Earth)**—
thus, he could respond to all under Heaven.

**Yang** moves within; even the slightest pause is **Fù’s** meaning.
The disciples of **Zhuāngzi** and **Xúnzi** lost it in **persuasive debate**.

**East** is the sound of **Spring**,
**yang**□ is the sound of **Summer**—
those who perceive **harmony** also grasp its depth.
**Correspondence** is the sound of **Winter**.
To move unseen yet truly move—this is **authentic**;
to move at **Pǐ’s** time—this is **correct**.
To see movement and move—this is **Without Misdemeanor**.
Yet why there are **disasters**—
**yang** is weak and lacks response.
When response comes and it moves—
this is **true benefit**.

**Jīngqi (Essential Qi)** becomes **form**—**substance**.
**Yóuhún (Wandering Spirit)** becomes **transformation**—**function**.
The **noble’s** study begins with **nourishing oneself**.
All else—governing others, responding to things—
are secondary matters.

**Sharp division** is **talent and strength**,
**clear argumentation** is **wisdom and insight**,
**broad tolerance** is **virtue and capacity**.
The three must never be lacking.

Those without **virtue** blame and resent others,
easily **overfull**—when **overfull**, they stagnate.
The dragon can grow vast or small,
yet it too has **restraints**.
Bound by **yīn-yáng Qi**,
it thrives with the **seasons** and transforms—
but when the **seasons** shift, it cannot.

**Bóyì** valued **righteousness** above all,
refusing even **Zhōu** grain—
until **starvation** and **death** forced him to stop,
he achieved **benevolence** alone.

Even three people walking together have a teacher;
but to **learn from** a **neighbor’s** virtuous one,
or from the **world’s** virtuous one,
and then seek **Heaven’s** ancient sages—
none can surpass this.

When **righteousness** weighs heavily within,
the **inner** is **heavy**;
when **profit** weighs heavily within,
the **outer** is **heavy**.
**Fù (Joy)** is **speech**—
other **speeches** all bring **harm**.
Only **friends** in **discourse** lack this **flaw**,
so it is spoken of as the **ultimate**.

Those who follow **Heaven’s principles** in movement
say, *"Creation is within me."*
Study that does not reach **Heaven and humankind**—
is not yet **true study**.

The **noble**, in the *Yijing*,
**contemplates the symbols**, **contemplates the numbers**,
**contemplates the words**, **contemplates the meanings**.
A physician who can **heal** must also **heal their patient’s ailments**;
if they cannot—
they are not a **true physician**.
A physician who **heals what others cannot**—
this is the **physician of the world**.
Those who can **handle what others cannot**—
can **do what others cannot**.

Humankind suffers from **self-satisfaction**—
when **overfull**, they stagnate.
Thus, **Yǔ** did not **self-satisfy**,
yet he **borrowed** the means to be **virtuous**.
Though **studied**, one should always **feel insufficient**,
never **presume superiority** when facing the **profound**.

If humankind **applies their mind**,
they will **gain understanding**.
Only the **depth** differs—
some **wisdom** is **shallow**, some **deep**.
When **principles are exhausted**, one knows **nature**;
when **nature is fulfilled**, one knows **fate**—
only then does one **arrive**.

If **loss** comes before **gain**,
one does not **rejoice** in the **gain**.
If **gain** comes before **loss**,
the **loss** is hard to **accept**—
and one will **meet ruin**.
Humankind must have **virtue and capacity**,
then **joy and anger** will not be **misplaced**.

Whether as **minister** or **commoner**,
or even **transcending all learning**—
it should be as if **nonexistent**.
Humankind must **value the inner**;
when the **inner** is **heavy**,
the **outer** is **light**.
If the **inner** is **light**,
the **outer** must **heavy**—
**greed for profit and fame** knows no bounds.

Those who grasp **Heaven’s principles**—
not only do they **nourish the body**,
they **nourish the heart**;
not only do they **nourish the heart**,
they **nourish life and fate**.
Though many speak of **reading books**,
few truly **read them**.
If one attains **Heaven’s principles** as **true joy**,
what **book** cannot be **read**?
What **fortress** cannot be **broken**?
What **principle** cannot be **mastered**?

The **calendrical system** cannot be without variation.
Those who study the **calendrical system** today
only know its **laws**,
not its **principles**.
The one who could **arrange calculations** was **Luoxia Hong** of the **Luo River** region.
The one who could **predict celestial movements** was **Gan Gong** and **Shi Gong**.
**Luoxia Hong** only knew the **laws** of the **calendrical system**,
while **Yang Xiong** knew both the **laws** and the **principles**.
In a year, the **intercalary months** of six **yin** and six **yang**,
three years yield thirty-six extra days,
so there is one **intercalation** every three years;
five years yield sixty extra days,
so there is a second **intercalation** every five years.
**Heaven’s time**, **Earth’s principles**, and **human affairs**—
these three are not easily mastered.
**Innate endowment** comes from **Heaven**,
**learning and wisdom** come from **humankind**.
**Innate endowment** springs from within,
**learning and wisdom** are acquired from without.
**Sincerity** (*zìchéng*) is **clarifying the nature** (*míngxìng*).
**Self-illumination** (*zìmíng*) is **sincere study** (*chéngxué*).
**Yan Zi** did not **transfer his anger** nor **repeat his mistakes**.
**Transferring anger** and **repeating mistakes** are both **emotional** (*qíng*),
not **innate nature** (*xìng*).
If one does not reach **the level of life and fate** (*xìngmìng*),
one cannot be said to **love learning**.
**Bo Yi** and **Liu Xia Hui** attained **one aspect of the Sage**,
**Bo Yi** attained **the Sage’s purity** (*qīng*),
**Liu Xia Hui** attained **the Sage’s harmony** (*hé*).
**Confucius** knew when to **be pure**, when to **harmonize**,
when to **act**, when to **rest**—
thus he attained **the Sage’s timing** (*shì*).
In *The Taixuan*, nine days correspond to two **hexagrams** (*guà*),
while the remaining **hexagram** corresponds to four and a half days.
**Yang Xiong** composed *The Taixuan*,
and can be said to **perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth**.
The **art of warfare** must await
**people’s prosperity**, **granaries full**, **treasuries abundant**,
**strong armies**, **just authority**, **favorable Heavenly time**,
and **secured Earthly advantage**—
then one may **launch a campaign**.
*The Yijing* has **no fixed standard** (*tǐ*).
It says: **"Once there are established norms** (*diǎncháng*), then there is a standard.**
Yet fearing this might be taken as having a fixed standard,
it adds: **"It cannot be made into a rigid rule** (*diǎn yào*)."
**Established norms** are **constant** (*cháng*),
**not rigid rules** are **adaptable** (*biàn*).
**Zhuang Zhou** spoke eloquently for thousands of years—
yet he was but one person.
As in *"The Butcher’s Cleaving of an Ox"* it says:
**"He stood gazing all around, four times looking back."**
**Confucius**, observing the **Lü River’s waters**, remarked:
**"To tread upon the water’s path is to act without partiality."**
Both are **utterances of ultimate truth** (*zhìlǐ*).
**Laozi’s** Five Thousand Words
mostly **illuminate the principles of things** (*wùlǐ*).
Now, if someone stands upon two **equal platforms** (*tái*),
both platforms being the same height,
they will not perceive their elevation.
But if one platform is high,
then they know the other is low.
**Study** that does not reach **true joy** (*lè*)
cannot be called **true study**.
**A nation, a family, and an individual** are all the same—
if one can **manage oneself** (*yīshēn*),
then one can **manage a family**.
If one can **manage a family**,
then one can **manage a nation**.
If one can **manage a nation**,
then one can **manage the world**.
The **heart** is the **root of the body**,
the **family** is the **root of the nation**,
the **nation** is the **root of the world**.
If the **heart** can **govern the body**,
then if the **heart** does not desire something,
can the **body** act accordingly?
**Humankind’s vital essence** (*shénjīng*)
is **precious** when **concealed** and **applied** with purpose.
If it is **flaunted outward** (*yòng yú wài*),
then few will **not fail**.
Like a **sharp blade** (*lìrèn*),
when things come to it, it **cleaves** (*zhuàn*) them.
If one **relies on the blade’s sharpness** and **demands to cut** from things,
then both the **blade** and the **things** will be harmed.
**Words** that issue from **true sincerity** (*zhēnchéng*),
then the **heart** does not **labor** but finds **ease** (*yì*),
and **humankind** will **long trust** them.
**Deception** and **trickery** may **temporarily** deceive **humankind**,
but **in the long run**, they will **fail**.
**Humankind** values **virtue** (*dé*).
Even the **petty** (*xiǎorén*) may possess **talent** (*cái*),
but **talent** cannot be **relied upon**,
and **virtue** cannot be **lacked**.
**Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon**—
their **longevity** is **eternal**.
Thus **humankind** should **cherish the distant** (*cún hù yuǎn*),
not **seeing the near** (*bù jiàn qīnjìn*).
The **gentleman** (*jūnzǐ*), whether in **plowland** (*quǎnmǔ*),
then **acts in accordance with plowland’s affairs**.
In **the ancestral temple** (*miàotáng*),
then **acts in accordance with the temple’s affairs**.
Thus **there is none** who **enters** without **finding self-satisfaction** (*zìdé*).
**Cunning schemes** may **sometimes** succeed in **one day** (*yīzhāo*),
but they will **inevitably fail** (*shǐ qióng*),
only **ultimate sincerity** (*zhìchéng*) **endures** alongside **Heaven and Earth**.
If **Heaven and Earth** can **cease to exist** (*wú*),
then **ultimate sincerity** may **rest**.
But if **Heaven and Earth** cannot **cease to exist**,
then **ultimate sincerity** will **never rest**.
To **forge a chariot** within a **room** (*shìzhōng zào chē*),
yet it can **traverse the world** (*tiānxià kěxíng*),
is because it **holds to the axle’s fixed path** (*zhí*).
If one **follows proper virtue and principle** (*yìlǐ*),
and **aligns with human sentiment** (*hé rénqíng*),
then wherever **sun and moon** shine,
they can **traverse everywhere**.
**The Doctrine of the Mean** (*Zhōngyōng*)
is neither **sent down from Heaven** nor **born from Earth**,
but **measures the principles of things** (*kuì wùlǐ*),
**gauges human sentiment** (*dù rénqíng*),
and **acts in accordance with what is natural** (*xíng qí suǒ’ān*),
thus attaining **what is proper** (*shì*).

To **gather the world’s wisdom** as **wisdom** (*zhì*),
and **gather the world’s goodness** as **goodness** (*shàn*),
then one’s **scope** is **vast**.
But **self-reliance** makes one **narrow**.
The **Han scholars** (*hànrú*)
used **contrary interpretation** (*fǎnjīng hé dào*)
to **balance** (*quán*) **the light and heavy** of **things** (*wù*),
thus attaining **one aspect** of the **Way**.
**Balancing** (*quán*) is used to **weigh the light and heavy** of **things** (*wù*),
the **Sage** **applies balancing** (*xíng quán*),
**considering the light and heavy** and **acting accordingly**,
**harmonizing** (*hé*) **what is proper**.
Thus, one who **adheres rigidly to the Middle** (*zhí zhōng*)
without **balancing** is still **one-sided**.

**Wang Tong** spoke of the **Spring and Autumn Annals’** (*Chūnqiū*)
**Sovereign’s Way** (*wángdào*) **and balancing** (*quán*),
and none could **compare** to him.
Thus **balancing** resides **in one person** (*yīshēn*),
then there is **one person’s balancing** (*yīshēn zhī quán*),
in a **village** (*yīxiāng*), then there is **one village’s balancing**,
up to **the world** (*tiānxià*), then there is **the world’s balancing**.
Though **methods** differ,
**the balancing** is **one**.

**The bow** indeed has **strength** and **weakness** (*qiángruò*),
yet if **one bow** is **drawn by two people** (*yīgōng èr rén zhāng zhī*),
the one with **greater wealth and power** (*cái yǒu lì*) considers the **bow weak**,
while the one without **power** considers the **bow strong**.
Thus the **powerful** do not **reckon their own strength** as **excessive**,
but **blame the bow’s weakness**,
and the **powerless** do not **reckon their own strength** as **insufficient**,
but **blame the bow’s strength**.
How **shallow** their **thoughts** are!

It is not the **bow** that has **strength** or **weakness**,
but the **two people’s strength** that differs.
Now, if there is **a single cup of food** before them,
and **two people** are **starving** (*dà è*) while **seeing it**,
if they **yield to each other** (*xiāng ràng*),
then both will **equally eat**.
But if they **seize it** (*xiāng duó*),
they will **contend**—
and it is not merely **contention** (*zhēng*) that will occur,
but one may **even fail to obtain their food**.
These two cases are both **human sentiment** (*rénqíng*).
Few **know** them.

Understanding this, all matters of the world are likewise.

The *Yijing* is the means by which the Sage nurtures the virtuous and diminishes the petty. When it nurtures, it prevents evil before it arises. When it diminishes, it restrains it before it arises. Nurturing and diminishing, opening and closing—all blend indistinguishably, leaving no trace. Unless one attains the utmost divine insight, who else could comprehend this?

*Tai Qi* is fundamentally weak at its extremes—only those with great virtue and high station can rectify it. There are things that may be transgressed and things that must not be transgressed. There are those with great virtue and high station who may transgress—such as Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou—yet they must not be usurped. There are those with great virtue but no high station who must not be slandered—such as Confucius and Mencius.

If one’s station does not match one’s virtue, how vast is the station! It is the dwelling place where talent is employed.

Next, *Ge* (剥) reveals that order arises from chaos. *Gui* (姤) and *Kui* (夬) show that chaos arises from order. Truly, time is ever thus—there has never been *Ge* without *Fu* (复), nor *Kui* without *Gui*. Guard against what must be guarded, and the state will flourish, its descendants enduring. Thus, the Sage values preemptive measures against what has not yet occurred—this is called the great framework of the *Yijing*.

*Xiantian* learning is the law of the heart. Therefore, all diagrams begin from the center, for all transformations and affairs originate in the heart. *Xiantian* learning hinges on sincerity—utter sincerity can commune with the divine, but without sincerity, one cannot attain the Way.

In the *Xiantian* diagram, there is the *Huan Zhong* (环中). Whatever is undertaken must be measured by one’s strength—measured strength endures. The path one walks must not be too narrow, for breadth reduces obstruction.

One who truly knows the *Yijing* does not need to cite or expound—this is true mastery. Mencius never explicitly discussed the *Yijing*, yet its principles are preserved within his words. Few perceive them.

If one can apply the *Yijing*, then one truly knows it. Mencius may be called one who skillfully applied the *Yijing*.

Study should prioritize human affairs. Today’s classics are the human affairs of antiquity. Beyond the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ three commentaries, the *Lü Chun* and *Yan Zhu* can be studied together.

When speaking of "Emperors, Kings, and Hegemons," it does not refer solely to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the Three Kings, and Five Hegemons. Rather, to govern with *wuwei* is to be an Emperor, to govern with benevolence and trust is to be an Emperor, to govern with fairness is to be a King, to govern with cunning and force is to be a Hegemon. Below the Hegemon lies the barbarian, and below the barbarian lies the beast.

Ji Zha’s talent was nearly that of Boyi. The talents of Shu Xiang, Zi Chan, and Yan Zi were equal. Guan Zhong, though using stratagem and late in recognizing principles, was ultimately a man of extraordinary talent and strength.

The Five Hegemons were foremost in merit yet chief in guilt. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is Confucius’ penal code. Merit and guilt are not concealed—first, the Sage praises merit, then condemns guilt. Thus, even criminals with merit must be recorded, and one must not be without forgiveness.

The first to establish two observatories—this "first" is a censure, punishing their lack of precedent. The initial offering of six feathers—this "initial" is praise, for they had previously usurped the eight-rank dance.

I received the *Spring and Autumn Annals* from Yin Shi Lu, who received it from Mu Bo Chang. Later, I questioned Bo Chang: "The *Spring and Autumn Annals* contains no praise, only censure." Tian Shu Gu said, "Sun Fu also claimed the *Spring and Autumn Annals* has only censure and no praise."

He replied: "When rituals and laws decay and君臣 relations falter, how could those who perform minor good deeds be excluded? Moreover, the Five Hegemons truly benefited the world. Though they did not attain kingship, were they not superior to barbarians? How could they be excluded?"

Those who study the *Spring and Autumn Annals* must distinguish between name and reality, and first determine the merit and guilt of the Five Hegemons, or they cannot claim to understand it. Once the Five Hegemons’ merit and guilt are established, the broad intent stands firm. If one seeks to examine every detail, there will be no beginning.

In general, scholars in their studies err by overemphasizing their own assertions. King Ping bore the name of king but was no more than a minor vassal. Qi and Jin, though nominally vassals, usurped royal prerogatives—this is the discrepancy between name and reality in the *Spring and Autumn*.

Zigong wished to remove the sacrificial sheep for announcing the new moon, for the sheep was merely a name, while ritual was the reality. If the name remains while the reality vanishes, it is still better than both name and reality disappearing. If the name is preserved, who knows if future ages will not see a king arising from such dependence?

The Duke of Qin had great merit toward the Zhou, could relocate and reform, and was the foremost of the Hegemons. The Duke of Jin served the Zhou dynasty for generations and relocated King Ping to Luoyi. Next was Duke Huan of Qi, who assembled the lords nine times without arms. Following him was Duke Zhuang of Chu, whose strength was unmatched. Then came Duke Xiang of Song, though his hegemony was weak—he assembled the lords but was captured by Chu, and thus is unworthy of mention.

Those who study the *Spring and Autumn* must first establish the merit and guilt of these four states, or their analysis will lack coherence and fail to grasp the Sage’s intent. Between the *Spring and Autumn*, no one surpassed these four in merit or guilt. Thus, these four states were foremost in merit yet chief in guilt.

Some say the *Spring and Autumn* is not a book of nature and destiny—this is incorrect. Even in recording that the sacrificial cow’s mouth was injured and the divination cow was changed, or that the cow was still mourned three times, this was a censure based on the affairs of Lu. How could the Sage’s heart be so constrained? It was because of the absence of self. Is this not speaking from the perspective of nature and destiny?

Again, it is said: The *Spring and Autumn* praises and blames based on events—how could it tolerate private intentions?

It is further said: The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the Sage’s brush and pen#14, the most impartial record for all under Heaven. Yet, how could one know the Sage’s method of being so impartial?

As when the sacrificial cow’s injury revealed Lu’s usurpation of the *jiāo* rites#15, or when the initial offering of six feathers#16 exposed the old usurpation of the eight-rank dances, or when the new construction of the *Zhìmén* gate#17 revealed the absence of such a gate in the past—these were not the Sage’s deliberate intentions. Hence it is said: The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is a book that exhausts the *xìng* (nature)#15.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* was composed for the sake of the weak ruler and the strong minister, thus it is called the book of *míngfèn* (names and roles)#19. The Sage’s difficulty lies in achieving great undertakings without losing *rén yì* (benevolence and righteousness), *zhōng xìn* (loyalty and sincerity).

How then can one succeed? It lies in eliminating the four states#20. Those who possess horses lend them to others for riding, abandoning their own for the sake of others. Some ask: What is the difficulty of *cái* (talent)? It is said: Only when facing great matters does one truly grasp the difficulty of talent.

Why speak only of talent? Talent is the Heavenly endowment, and scholars refine it. Some say: Were there not ancient figures who achieved great deeds without relying on learning? It is said: Zhou Bo#21 and Huo Guang#22 could accomplish great matters, but only because they lacked learning, so their deeds were not entirely perfect.

A person without learning cannot discern truth. Unable to discern truth, they become obstinate and unyielding. Those with extraordinary talent must rely on *gāng* (rigidity) to overcome *zhōng* (moderation). Rigidity is sufficient to establish undertakings and endure calamities. Yet if applied to others, it becomes perverse and evil. Hence, Confucius said of Shen Gong#23: How could he have rigidity? Once desire exists, rigidity cannot be maintained.

The *jūnzǐ* (noble person) understands *yì* (righteousness), while the *xiàn rén* (virtuous person) understands only *lì* (profit). Those who forget both righteousness and profit are only the Sage who can achieve this. The noble person fears righteousness and thus refrains from certain actions, while the petty person does not fear it at all. The Sage, however, never transgresses the *jǔ* (boundaries), so what is there to fear in righteousness?

Yan Ziyou#24 did not repeat his mistakes. Confucius said: There was never anything he did not know was wrong, yet once he knew it, he never repeated it. This is being steadfast yet never returning to error. Han Yu#25 believed that one could, upon realizing a mistake, immediately eliminate it—this exceeds what Yan Ziyou achieved. Mistakes and rectifications are matters of private intent. How could one attain the Dao/Way#26?

Some say: To align with the good is not better than to align with the evil? It is said: The Sage does not think so; private intent makes mistakes and goodness alike.

In pursuing learning and cultivating the heart, the danger lies in not following the *zhí dào* (straight Dao/Way), and in abandoning *lìyù* (desires for profit). By adhering to the straight Dao and embracing *zhìchéng* (ultimate sincerity), one attains understanding in all things. The Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is straight—one must seek it straightly. If one uses clever schemes and shortcuts to seek it, they are bending Heaven and Earth to conform with human desires—is this not difficult?

In all matters, great or small, there are the principles of Heaven and humanity. Cultivating one’s self is a matter of humanity; whether one meets with fortune or misfortune is a matter of Heaven. Seeking these principles is a matter of humanity; whether one attains or fails is a matter of Heaven. Remaining unmoved by gain or loss is the way to align with Heaven.

Forcing outcomes will surely succeed, yet this defies Heaven’s principles. Those who defy Heaven’s principles will inevitably invite calamity. Lu’s two *guān* (observatories)#27 for *jiāo* (sacrificial rites to Heaven) and the *dà yǐn* (great ancestral sacrifice), were both unfit for ritual. If a feudal lord had only the four seasonal sacrifices, that would suffice as a regular offering. But the *dà yǐn* every five years is beyond what they should do.

Zhòng Yōng#28 could be entrusted to rule as a sovereign or to govern affairs. Who could emerge without passing through the *hù* (door)#29? The door is the Dao/Way; none can succeed without passing through the Dao. Those who do not pass through the door are like those who dig through walls or open secret passages.

To hear much, one must choose the good and follow it. Though one hears much, they must select what is good and follow it. To see much and recognize it. *Shí* (recognition) means *bié* (discrimination). Though one sees much, they must have a way to distinguish it.

Some ask: How does the *Spring and Autumn Annals* display *rén* (benevolence) and conceal *yòng* (practical application)? It is said: As the sun and moon illuminate all, and the four seasons complete the year, this is the display of benevolence. Yet, their regularity is known without understanding its cause—this is the concealment of practical application.

Emperor Shun#30 transformed the *Zhuānxù* calendar#31 to the *Tàichū* calendar#18, and Ziyou#32 established the *Tàixuān* (Great Mysterious) based on the *Tàichū*, comprising eighty-one *guà* (hexagrams). Nine divisions share two hexagrams, totaling fifteen and fourteen. When finely divided, four and a half divisions correspond to one hexagram.

*Qi* (vital energy) arises from the center of the body, hence the first hexagram is the *Zhōng* (Center). It correlates with Heaven and Earth while relying on *shù* (mathematical arrangement), yet this is not the true arrangement of Heaven and Earth. *Yǐ* (correlate) means *nǐ* (to approximate); the hexagrams approximate Heaven and Earth’s true arrangement and emerge from it.

*Yuán* (origin), *Lì* (prosperity), *Rén* (benevolence), and *Zhēn* (endurance) are ever-changing, reflecting the Dao/Way’s variations. *Jí* (auspicious) and *xiōng* (inauspicious), *huǐ* (regret), and *lì* (discontent) are ever-shifting, responding to human affairs.

Ghosts and spirits are formless yet functional; their nature can be discerned, and their effects are visible. Just as a person’s ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet, or the branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, and colors of plants, are all the workings of ghosts and spirits. Who governs the bestowal of *fú* (blessings) upon the good and *huò* (calamities) upon the licentious? Who possesses *cōngmíng zhèngzhí* (keen insight and rectitude)? Who achieves *bùjí ér sù* (swift without haste) and *bùxíng ér zhì* (arrives without traveling)? All are manifestations of ghosts and spirits’ nature.

The *Yì* (Book of Changes) has *yìxiàng* (intent and image), and all established intents serve to clarify images. The three categories below encompass: *yǎnxiàng* (spoken images), which do not imitate objects but directly speak to elucidate matters; *xiàngxiàng* (visual symbols), which imitate one object to clarify intent; and *shùxiàng* (numerical symbols), such as seven days, eight months, three years, or ten years.

The *Yì*’s numerical symbols exhaust the extremes of Heaven and Earth. Some ask: Does Heaven and Earth also have extremes? It is said: Given their waxing and waning, how could they lack extremes? Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they are still *xíngqì* (forms and instruments), merely two objects.

The *Yì* has *nèixiàng* (internal symbols), which are the principles of truth. It has *wàixiàng* (external symbols), which are fixed representations of one object. In humanity, the Dao/Way of *qián* (Heaven) completes the male, while the Dao/Way of *kūn* (Earth) completes the female.

In matters, the Dao/Way of *qián* (Heaven) manifests as *yáng* (the luminous/active), while the Dao/Way of *kūn* (Earth) manifests as *yīn* (the obscure/passive). The divine has no fixed form, and the *Yì* (Book of Changes) has no permanent substance. If it lingers in one direction, it cannot transform and vary—this is not the divine. If it has a fixed substance, it cannot adapt and flow—this is not the *Yì*.

Though the *Yì* has symbols, these symbols are merely *xiàng* (representations). Through representations, one perceives the substance, yet fundamentally, there is no substance. The Dao/Way is spoken of as *yī yīn yī yáng* (one yin and one yang), but the Dao/Way itself is without sound or form, invisible to the eye. Hence, it borrows the Dao/Way’s *xiàng* (symbols) to establish what people possess. Actions must follow the Dao/Way. One yin and one yang—the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth. All things arise through this and are formed by it.

No matter the scale, all things have the Dao/Way within them. If one can abide by their proper measure, it is called the Dao/Way; if not, it is called not the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way is evident in the virtuous—Heaven and Earth’s function in generating myriad beings is visible to humanity. Yet the means by which they create all beings remain unseen by people—this is the Dao/Way’s hidden operation.

The proper sequence of sounds and numerical rhythms, when carried out to seven and then ceasing, is because the Summer Solstice sun rises at *yín* (the Tiger, 3 AM) and sets at *xū* (the Dog, 7 PM). The hours of *hài* (the Boar, 9 PM), *zǐ* (the Rat, 11 PM), and *chǒu* (the Ox, 1 AM) are when the sun descends into the earth, and the eyes see nothing. These three numbers are not operational—thus they are compared to these three hours. Hence, the numbers of living beings are also such; it is not that these numbers are non-operational, but that they are unseen.

The moon’s intrinsic nature is dark, yet it receives the sun’s light and appears white. Water in the human body is *blood*, and *tǔ* (earth) in the human body is *flesh*. To weave and manage the world is called *cái* (talent), to strive with certainty of reaching one’s goal is called *zhì* (aspiration), and to encompass and contain all is called *liàng* (capacity). The *liù xū* (six voids) refer to the six positions. The voids await change, and this is the matter of movement. If there is form, there is substance; if there is nature, there is *qíng* (emotion).

Heaven governs *yòng* (function/operation), while Earth governs *tǐ* (substance). The sage governs function, and the common people govern substance—hence, they act without knowing it. The *gǎn* (gallbladder) and *shèn* (kidneys) share the same *yīn* (obscure) nature, while the *xīn* (heart) and *pí* (spleen) share the same *yáng* (luminous) nature. The heart governs the eyes, and the spleen governs the nose.

Within *yáng* (the luminous), *yáng* is the sun; within *yīn* (the obscure), *yīn* is the moon. *Yīn* within *yáng* is the stars; *yáng* within *yīn* is the *chén* (constellations). Gently within gently is water; gently within hard is fire. Hard within gently is earth; hard within hard is stone. The law began with *Fúxī* (Fu Xi), was perfected by *Yáo* (Yao), reformed by the Three Sovereigns, reached its peak with the Five Hegemons, and ended with *Qín* (Qin). The traces of governance and chaos across ten thousand generations cannot evade this pattern.

The sun corresponds to the heart, the moon to the gallbladder, the stars to the spleen, and the constellations to the kidneys. Stone corresponds to the lungs, earth to the liver, fire to the stomach, and water to the *pángguāng* (urinary bladder). The *Yì*’s numbers of living beings total **129,600**, which are **4,320** in the *chén* (constellations). These are the grand numbers of waxing and waning, unfolding the *chén* numbers of thirty years—thus their tally is complete.

A year has 360 days, yielding 4,320 *chén* (constellations), multiplied by thirty gives its total. Generally, *jiǎzǐ* (the first *chén* of the Heavenly Stem, 4 AM) and *jiǎwǔ* (the fifth *chén* of the Heavenly Stem, 7 AM) mark the beginning of an era—this is the number governing the world, starting from *rìjiǎ* (the first *chén* of the day, 4 AM), *yuèzǐ* (the first *chén* of the moon, 11 PM), *xīngjiǎ* (the first *chén* of the stars, 4 AM), and *chénzǐ* (the first *chén* of the constellations, 11 PM). It is also said: This is the operational *chén* of the world’s beginning, with the moon’s first *chén*, the stars’ first *chén*, and the constellations’ first *chén* following it.

The *qi* (breath) of the nose is seen by the eyes; the words of the mouth are heard by the ears. This is the principle of correspondence.

The theory of the *yǐgài* (leaning cover) states that Kunlun’s four slopes descend into the seas, but logically this is not so. The earth is square and still—how could it revolve like the round, moving Heaven?

The tides are the earth’s breathing. Their response to the moon follows their kindred nature.

The Ten Heavenly Stems are Heaven; the Twelve Earthly Branches are Earth. Branches and Stems correspond to Heaven and Earth’s functions.

Living creatures are born from the head; plants from the roots. Those born from the head have life in the head; those from the roots, life in the roots.

The *shén* (spirit) is the master of the *Yì* (Changing), rendering it formless. The *Yì* is the manifestation of the *shén*, rendering it bodiless.

Following principle yields constancy; beyond principle lies strangeness. Wind and water types oppose in scale—great and small.

*Zhèn* (Thunder) is the Dragon. When one *yáng* (positive) stirs beneath two *yīn* (negative), it is *zhèn*. Beneath the deep abyss, there moves a creature—is it not the Dragon?

One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten-thousand, hundred-million are *jī* (odd), the numbers of Heaven. Twenty, twenty-hundred, two-thousand, twenty-two-thousand are *ǒu* (even), the numbers of Earth.

Heaven’s *yáng* resides in the southeast, where the sun and moon dwell. Earth’s *yīn* lies in the northwest, where fire and stone abide.

The body is Earth, rooted in stillness. What enables movement is *qi* and blood.

Fire’s essence is primary; its form secondary. Water’s form is primary; its essence secondary.

*Yáng* is by nature, *yīn* by emotion. Nature is divine; emotion, ghostly.

From *Zhèn* to *Gèn* (Mountain)—this clarifies King Wen’s eight trigrams. The fixed positions of Heaven and Earth reveal Fu Xi’s eight trigrams.

The eight trigrams interlocking reveal the sixty-four hexagrams formed by their crossing.

Counting backward follows the order of things—moving with Heaven is leftward rotation, all born hexagrams, hence "counting backward."

Knowing the future reverses the order—moving against Heaven is rightward, all unborn hexagrams, hence "knowing the future."

Thus, the *Yì*’s numbers arise from reversal. This passage directly interprets the diagram’s intent: reversal reveals the four seasons.

The *Yáo Diǎn* (Tribute of Yao) sets the period at 366 *xún* (decades). If the sun’s excess is six, then the moon’s deficit is also six. Subtracting the twelve excess days of sun and moon leaves 354—this is the sun’s true course. Dividing by twelve yields twenty-nine days. Half of fifty is ten; three days in two yields six; two Earthly Branches in two yields four—this is the division of *Tàijí* (Supreme Ultimate) by Heaven and Earth.

Heaven’s variations are six; six times six yields thirty-six—the number of one *yáo* (line) of *Qián* (Creative). Accumulating six *yáo* yields 216—the total for *Qián*’s lines. Six times four yields twenty-four—the number of one *yáo* of *Kūn* (Receptive). Accumulating six *yáo* yields 144—the total for *Kūn*’s lines. Summing both yields 1,152.

The *Sū Wèn* (Plain Questions) states: The lungs govern skin and fur; the heart, vessels; the spleen, flesh; the liver, sinews; the kidneys, bones—from above to below, from exterior to interior. The heart’s blood and kidneys’ bones are the law of exchange. Exchange is application.

The *Yì* begins with the Three Sovereigns; the *Shū* (Documents) with the Two Emperors; the *Shī* (Odes) with the Three Kings; the *Chūnqiū* (Spring and Autumn) with the Five Hegemons.

*Qián* represents Heaven’s kind—its original symbol. It also represents metal—its listed symbol.

The *Yì*’s beginning is with *Qián* and *Kūn*; its center with *Kàn* (Abysmal) and *Lí* (Clinging); its end with water and fire—whether they intermingle or not, all are ultimate truths.

When Heaven and Earth move in parallel, the *zàngfǔ* (viscera and bowels) align. The four viscera are Heaven; the bowels, Earth.

From *Qián* and *Kūn* to *Kàn* and *Lí* follows the Heavenly Way. From *Xián* (Binding) to *Jìjí* (Sated) and *Wèijì* (Unsated) follows human affairs.

*Tàijí* is One. The unmoved generates Two; Two is the *shén* (spirit).

Fire generates dampness; water generates dryness.

The *shén* generates numbers; numbers generate symbols; symbols generate instruments.

*Tàijí* unmoved is nature. When it manifests, it becomes spirit; spirit becomes numbers; numbers become symbols; symbols become instruments—yet instruments’ transformations return to spirit.

From *Fù* (Returning) to *Qián*, there are 220 *yáng*. From *Xián* to *Kūn*, there are 80 *yáng*. From *Xián* to *Kūn*, there are 220 *yīn*. From *Fù* to *Qián*, there are 80 *yīn*.

*Qián* is *jī* (odd), *yáng*, and vigorous—thus nothing is more vigorous than Heaven beneath the heavens. *Kūn* is paired, *yīn*, and yielding—thus nothing is more yielding than Earth, enabling it to follow Heaven.

*Zhèn* is arising—one *yáng* arising. Arising is movement; thus nothing moves like thunder.

*Kàn* is sinking—one *yáng* sinking into two *yīn*. Sinking is descent; thus nothing descends like water.

*Gèn* is stopping—one *yáng* halts here. Thus nothing halts like mountains.

*Sūn* (Wind) is entering—one *yīn* entering beneath two *yáng*; thus nothing enters like wind.

*Lí* is adornment—one *yīn* separates from two *yáng*, its hexagram forming a textured, radiant pattern; thus nothing is more adorned than fire, hence also "adornment" in attachment.

*Duì* (Joy) is delight—one *yīn* emerges outward, delighting in things; thus nothing delights like marshes.

Fire is dark within and bright without, so *Lí*’s *yáng* is external. Fire’s use is external.

Water is dark without and bright within, so *Kàn*’s *yáng* is internal. Water’s use is internal.

Three Heavenly Stems to two Earthly Branches in borrowing numbers—this is not the true count of Heaven and Earth.

*Yǐ* (borrowing) is analogy, analogizing to Heaven and Earth’s true numbers to generate them.

Human schemes are of **human** origin.
Ghostly schemes are of **Heaven**’s origin.
When Heaven and humanity conspire together, all is possible—then the matter succeeds and brings fortune.

Tang banished Jie, and King Wu attacked Zhou—yet they were not seen as regicides—just as Mencius said: *"Men and women do not touch each other in giving and receiving"* (a matter of **ritual**), but *"if a brother’s wife is drowning, one rescues her with one’s hands"* (a matter of **expediency**). Thus, though Confucius honored Yi and Qi, he also aligned with Tang and Wu.
Yi and Qi embody **virtue**.
Tang and Wu embody **righteousness**.
Only Tang and Wu were justified—it was not usurpation.

The hexagrams that do not intersect with **Qian** (Heaven) and **Kun** (Earth) arise from **Pi** (Opposition) and **Tai** (Nourishment).
**Pi** and **Tai** are the intersection of **Qian** and **Kun**.
**Qian** and **Kun** emerge from **odd** and **even**—
**odd** and **even** arise from the **Tài Jí** (Supreme Ultimate).
From **Tai** to **Pi**, there lies **Chóng** (Infiltration).
From **Pi** to **Tai**, there lies **Suí** (Following).

When Heaven grants me what I have, this is called **fate**.
**Fate** within me is called **nature**.
**Nature** in things is called **principle**.

Change follows the **times** and is convenient—
without violating the **great framework of ritual**,
change follows the **times** and is harmonious—
without losing the **great authority of righteousness**—
this is the **Way of the virtuous**.

The **yang qi** of the **Lunar New Year** arises from the north and exhausts there—
this is the **cyclical transformation** of change.

Spring **yang** gains **expediency**, hence droughts abound;
Autumn **yin** gains **expediency**, hence rains abound.

There are two **origins**:
One is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—**Tài Jí**.
The other is the individual beginnings of all things—**the root of life**.

The theory of the **Five Stars** originates with **Gān Gōng** and **Shí Gōng**.

The **heart of Heaven and Earth** is the **root of all things**.
The **emotions of Heaven and Earth** are their **manifestations**—
they share the same **emotional essence** as ghosts and spirits.

Heaven has **Five Celestial Bodies**—Sun, Moon, and the three stars—
together with Heaven, they form **Five**.
Earth has **Five Phases**—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—
together they form **Five**.

There are **hot springs** but no **cold fires**—
**yin** follows **yang**, but **yang** cannot follow **yin**.

There is thunder, there is lightning;
There is lightning, there is wind.
Wood’s firmness cannot be shaken without thunder.
Grass’s gentleness cannot be moistened without dew.

Human intelligence strengthens as **qi** of things weakens.
**Yang numbers** exceed three hundred sixty,
while **yin numbers** fall short of three hundred sixty.

Humans are the most **sentient** of all things,
yet their **class** is tied to **walking**—
**walking** is **yin**.
Thus, there are **one hundred twenty** [days].

Rain arises from water,
dew from soil,
thunder from stone,
lightning from fire.

Lightning and wind both reach the **extreme of yang**,
so lightning always brings wind.

Zhuangzi and Huizi strolled along the **Háoliáng Bridge**,
and Zhuangzi said: *"The carp glides freely—this is the fish’s joy."*
This is the **full realization of one’s nature** extending to all things—
not just the fish, but all things under Heaven.
Thus, one like Zhuangzi may be said to **harmonize perfectly with things**.

Zhuangzi wrote *The Bandit Zhi* to illustrate **utter depravity**—
even the **most sagely** cannot transform it.
For **superior intelligence** and **inferior stupidity** cannot be altered.

The **scholar of Lu**—this refers to **Confucius**.
**Laozi** was the one who understood the **essence of the *Yì Jīng*** (Book of Changes).

When matters under Heaven begin with **excessive weight**, they end in **lightness**.
When they begin with **excessive thickness**, they end in **thinness**.
How much more so when they begin with **lightness** or **thinness**?

Thus, few fail through **excessive weight**,
many fail through **lightness**.
Few fail through **excessive thickness**,
many fail through **thinness**.

Hence, the virtuous do not fear **excessive weight**,
but always fear **lightness**.
They do not fear **excessive thickness**,
but always fear **thinness**.

Zhuangzi’s *Equating Things* does not escape **comparison**—
**comparison** leads to **contention**,
**contention** leads to **imbalance**,
**imbalance** leads to **disharmony**.
**Non-thinking, non-action** is the realm of **divine unity**—
this is the **"one thread that runs through all."**

The sage uses this to **purify the heart** and **retreat into seclusion**.

To **act when duty calls** without yielding to one’s teacher—
this is the **Way to elevate others**.

When **Mù Gōng of Qin** attacked Zheng and was defeated with regret,
he **reflected deeply**—
this was not merely the act of a **hegemonic ruler**,
but nearly the **Way of the King**.
To **regret** is to have no **faults**.
This is why the sage records it in the **final chapters**.

When **Liǔ Ruò** asked about **non-action**, the reply was:
*"Speak only when the time is right—people will not tire of your words.
Laugh only when joyful—people will not tire of your laughter.
Take only when righteous—people will not tire of your taking.
This is what is meant by **non-action**."*

When **Gǔyǒu** killed a man, **Shùn** abandoned the world as one discards a worn-out shoe.
He fled, carrying his stolen goods, and settled by the sea,
living joyfully his whole life, forgetting the world.
Even the sage, though ruling all under Heaven,
cannot alter **human nature’s love**.

*The Wén Zhōngzǐ* says:
*"Those who easily take pleasure will surely know much sorrow,
those who give lightly will surely love to take."*

Some say: *"All under Heaven pursue profit and abandon righteousness—
what can I, alone, do?"*
The Master replied: *"Abandon what they contend for,
take what they abandon—
is this not the conduct of the virtuous?"*
Such words are **ritual and righteousness**.

The **division of heart and deed** has long been clear.
If compared, they are the **words of creation and transformation**.

Zhuangzi’s **bold spirit**—like the **Lǚ Liáng incident**—
speaks to the **ultimate**.
*The Bandit Zhi* speaks of **matters beyond remedy**—
even the sage cannot act.
*The Fisherman* speaks of **matters that cannot be forced**—
even the sage cannot force them.
These words explain the **principles of action and non-action**:
to **follow principle** is **non-action**,
to **force** is **action**.

Gold must be refined a hundred times before it is pure—
humans are the same.

The **Buddhist school** abandons the **Way of sovereign-subject, parent-child, and husband-wife**—
how can this be **natural principle**?

Those who **aspire to the Dao**—speaking broadly—
**aspiration** means **devoting one’s heart**.
**Virtue** is what is **obtained and takes form**.
Thus, one can **rely on virtue**,
and **master virtue** through **ren**—
hence, **"depending"** upon it.

Zhuangzi says: Though the butcher does not govern the kitchen, the ritual officiant does not overstep the wine vessels to replace him.
This is the meaning of the **gentleman’s thoughts** not straying beyond his station—
**holding to his innate position** and acting accordingly.

When the Jin Fox (晋狐) shot the Maid (射姑), killing Yang Chu-fu (阳处父),
*The Spring and Autumn Annals* recorded: *"Jin killed the nobleman Yang Chu-fu,"*
a **euphemistic omission** of the truth.
The ruler who does not keep secrets loses his ministers,
thus it is recorded as a **state killing**.
When humans **attain the harmonious qi** of *zhonghe* (中和),
they balance **rigor and softness**.
If **yang qi** predominates, they lean toward **rigor**;
if **yin qi** predominates, they lean toward **softness**.

For humans to **aspire to the Dao**,
they must reach a point where **even spirits and gods cannot fathom their dwelling**—
this is the **ultimate**.

The authors of *The Book of Changes* (《易》),
did they truly **grasp the Dao of transformation**?
The **sage** understands the **principles of all things under heaven**,
and **unifies them with a single thread**.

Great soups can be **harmonized**,
dark wines can be **clarified**—
then **Creation itself** can also be **harmonized** and **clarified**.

There are things of **one day’s duration**,
things of **one month’s duration**,
things of **one season’s duration**,
things of **one year’s duration**,
things of **ten years’ duration**,
and **up to myriad ages**—
all have their measure.

Heaven and Earth are also **things**,
and they too have their **numbers**.

The sparrow is a **three-year thing**;
the horse is a **thirty-year thing**.
All creatures that **fly or run** can be measured by their years.

Humans are **two-hundred-ten-year things**.

**Taiji** (太极) is the **extreme of the Dao**.
**Taixuan** (太玄) is the **mysterious depth of the Dao**.
**Taisu** (太素) is the **origin of color**.
**Taiyi** (太一) is the **beginning of numbers**.
**Taichu** (太初) is the **first of affairs**.
Their **ultimate success** is **one**.

To **exchange one’s place** and dwell elsewhere is to **lose oneself**.
**Yin** is the **shadow of yang**;
**ghosts** are the **shadows of humans**.

**Qi** undergoes **six transformations**,
the **body** is divided into **four parts**.
To **lower oneself from high to low** is called **temporal rule**.
To **look up from below** is called **observation**.
**Without intention, without certainty, without rigidity, without self**—
when **unified**, this is **one**;
when **divided**, this is **two**.
When **unified**, this is **two**;
when **divided**, this is **four**.

It **begins with intention**,
and **completes with self**.
**Intention** then **begets certainty**,
**certainty** arises from **intention**.
**Rigidity** then **begets self**,
**self** arises from **rigidity**.
**Intention** has **certainty**#23,
**certainty** has **expectation**#24,
**rigidity** does not **transform**—
**self** has already **formed**.

The **scholarship of inquiry and memorization** is **insufficient for true practice**.
Wise indeed was **Liu Hou** (留侯),
who **well concealed his talents**.

Once **thought and deliberation** **emerge**,
even **spirits and gods** can **know and discern** them.
Thus, the **gentleman cannot neglect solitude**.

**Timing** then **speaks**,
for **speech** does not **originate from self**.

**Learning** lies in **unceasing practice**,
hence **Wang Tong** (王通) said: *"It is only with a lifetime’s devotion."*

**Sincerity** is the **instrument of governing one’s nature**—
it is **without beginning and without end**.
