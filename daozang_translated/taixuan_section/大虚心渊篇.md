**The Scripture of the Primal Void and the Abyssal Heart**

When my nature first arose, it received no distinction,
Perfect in great wisdom, luminous in true spirit.
At that time, things could not sprout their evil seeds,
Dust could not conceal the buds of sin.
Its realm was limpid and bright, radiant within;
My heart was without heart, serene in outward reflection.
Forms were without form, vast and unobstructed.
Ten thousand thoughts returned to emptiness—was this not joy?

Yet, entangled in karmic causes, forgetting what came before and losing what follows,
Clinging to dust and sorrow, coveting worldly affairs,
Day by day, three meals bring a hundred changes of heart;
Night by night, a single sleep sends the soul wandering through myriad scenes.
The spirit races to the land of desires,
The numinous dwells in the realm of affliction.
The soul sings, the spirit dances, hastening toward the path of death;
The mind dims, consciousness strays, turning from the road of life.
In such moments, how truly lamentable!

Better to bathe in the numinous spring, first watering the roots of goodness,
To sail the raft of Dharma-water, next washing away all that clouds my singular nature,
Striving for purity and clarity, without attachment or thought.
Perfect and unbroken, like the autumn moon hanging in the sky;
Serene and unobstructed, like white clouds parting from the peak.
Thus attaining emptiness without abiding,
Substance without form,
Awakening enters wisdom’s embrace,
Illuminating the Great Dao—
This is the realm of striving.

Those who cultivate life may reach this境界,
Observing the heart with the heart,
Seeing nature with nature.
The spirit, vast and boundless;
The true, profound and infinite.
Attained! Attained!

**When my nature first arose,**
It received this primordial nature,
Luminous as the Great One’s beginning.
Rooted in great simplicity, wholly abiding in the mysterious void.

**Receiving no distinction,**
The Great Sage cherishes compassion, grieving for the unenlightened.
Equal in karmic weight, each sinks into delusion.

**Bathing in the numinous spring,**
A single ladle, serene and clear,
The numinous spring rises from above.
Mysteriously irrigating, buds and shoots flourish.

**First watering the roots of goodness,**
Roots planted in goodness, sealed and nourished by the spring.
Moistening the veins, the flourishing field of spirit grows lush.

**Sailing the raft of Dharma-water,**
Water’s nature flows downward, yet its current ascends.
Without obstruction, cleansing is effortless.

**Next washing away all stains,**
Filth clings to the body, relying on Dharma-water to purify.
Across the Three Realms, a radiant clarity emerges.

**Cool, pure, and bright,**
Washing away all dust and grime,
True Suchness strives for purity.
The murky is shattered, wisdom’s awakening pierces the source.

**Without attachment or thought,**
Consciousness does not race, calmly untouched by pulls.
All affairs dissolve into a single clear spring.

**Perfect and unbroken,**
Wisdom’s nature is restored, as in the beginning, unharmed.
How could there be lack? Bright as frost.

**The autumn moon hanging in the sky,**
The pale moon on an autumn night,
Its radiance fills the heavens.
Heaven and earth turn white, resplendent as jade without dust.

**Serene and unobstructed,**
Utterly clear and pure, limpid without hindrance.
With a single sweep, how dare the slightest remain?

**White clouds parting from the peak,**
Gentle autumn silk thins, melting away from the jade peak.
Unstaying, where could brightness contend?

**Emptiness without abiding,**
Ten thousand forms cannot cling, all transcended into emptiness.
How could there be abiding? Vast and luminous, the numinous flows.

**Substance without form,**
Form is no-form, the formless lodges in form.
Majestically established, the true does not lose its spirit.

**Awakening enters wisdom’s embrace,**
Thoughts and realizations open, flowing into wisdom’s midst.
No darkness remains, white and bright, illuminating true emptiness.

**Illuminating the Great Dao,**
Within and without, all is clear,
In the profound, clarity is attained.
The Dao is seen, lucid as the sky of white clouds.

**This is the realm of striving,**
The realm of striving now entered, bright and pure as a single stream.
Without obstruction, vast and abundant.

**Those who cultivate life may reach this境界,**
Truly wondrous is cultivation, fit to approach the striving ford.
Of one measure, the Great Dao opens naturally.

**Observing the heart with the heart,**
Penetrating the ordinary heart, the other heart is likewise known.
Attaining freedom, vast and bright, illuminating all emptiness.

**Seeing nature with nature,**
Wisdom sees without hindrance, transcending self and other.
Without thought, clearly beholding true emptiness.

**The spirit, vast and boundless,**
Having attained the numinous and bright,
Subtle and profound, one with nature.
As my guardian, long it does not fall into emptiness.

**The true, profound and infinite,**
Equal to the flourishing harmony of the void,
How could there be distinction in rank?
Great or small, thus the true is boundless.

**Perfect in great wisdom,**
Wondrous sight, far-reaching and unobstructed,
Fortunate to attain perfection.
Holding the great awakening, this is closest to the natural.

**Luminous in true spirit,**
Naturally attaining the whiteness of the autumn moon,
The spirit’s light, vast and serene.
Unobscured, bright and pure as the heavens.

**Not sprouting evil seeds,**
Utterly true wisdom, roots and all awakened and bright.
Nowhere to arise, how could evil seeds sprout?

**Not concealing the buds of sin,**
Pure and flawless, the spirit’s light shines within and without.
The slightest stain—how could sin’s buds hide and grow?

**Inwardly observing, my heart is without heart,**
Thoroughly illuminating true wisdom,
Observing the heart—how could there be a heart?
Returning to stillness, not a single thought arises.

**Outwardly reflecting, forms are without form,**
The true image is without image,
How can dust’s forms be formed?
In unity, self and other are clearly merged.

**Vast and unobstructed,**
True nature without hindrance,
At ease, naturally attained.
All unbroken, boundless and without limit.

**Ten thousand thoughts return to emptiness,**
Worldly thoughts are ultimately illusory,
Forgotten, all enter emptiness.
With a single thought, the moon shines on the emerald pool.

**Was this not joy?**
Worldly states and fleeting glory,
Only suffice to delight the seven emotions.
Attaining true nature, joy is beyond naming.

**Entangled in karmic causes,**
Most of all, karmic conditions weigh heavily,
Pursuing them, transgressions deepen.
Heavenly nature dims, assailed by the six dusts.

**Clinging to dust and sorrow,**
Long bound to worldly ties,
Clinging to sorrow harms the great harmony.
Striving for purity, afflictions only multiply.

**A hundred transformations of the heart—**
Facing things, it breeds cunning,
A hundred shifts in the moment.
All but an inch—yet enslaved to such depths.

**The soul wanders ten thousand scenes,**
Dreams and fancies topple and invert,
The soul drifts through ten thousand scenes.
Iron and flesh—terror lies in the void.

**The spirit races to the realm of craving,**
The po is unmoored, the spirit faint,
The spirit races to the realm of craving.
With wisdom’s awakening, sounds and sights rush to ruin.

**Heavenly truth—**
**Bearing the spirit in the realm of affliction,**
True nature is drowned,
Anxieties bear the lone spirit.
Following them at every turn, how can one reach the wondrous source’s court?

**The hun sings, the po dances,**
The three luminous visions are spent,
All returned to the hun and po’s domain.
From dawn to dusk, song and dance,
Frolicking toward deceit and depravity.

**Drawn to the path of death,**
Unwilling to wander the true and upright,
Willingly entering the path of death.
The numinous essence is wholly extinguished,
The yin po finds release.

**The mind dulls, perception strays,**
Intent and discernment both obscured,
Muddled, dull, and lost.
The mountain of passions, the sea of desire—
No longer ascending toward truth.

**Turning from the path of life,**
Light, once shifted to darkness,
Does one yet know one has turned from life?
The three primals and seven treasures—
All seized by the eight perversities.

**Truly pitiable—**
Entering the realm of non-action,
True essence and the two are alike.
Round luminosity, vast and boundless,
The great virtue attains mysterious penetration.

**Attained at last!**
Returning from falsehood to cultivate truth,
Through truth, entering emptiness once more.
This is called true attainment—
Beyond attainment, no further effort remains.

**The Heart of the Great Void’s Abyss concludes.**
