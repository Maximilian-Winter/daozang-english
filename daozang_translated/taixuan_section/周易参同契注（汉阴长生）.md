### **Preface to the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* #1**

It is said that the *Cantong Qi* was originally the ancient *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger*, transmitted by the Perfected Lord Xu. The Perfected Lord Xu served as an attendant in Qingzhou and was a native of Beihai. Later, Wei Boyang of Shangyu in Yue composed the *Five Correlative Categories* to explicate the earlier text, thereby renaming it the *Cantong Qi*. Further, Chunyu Shutong supplemented its categories, drawing analogies from the Three Powers, and thus divided it into three scrolls.

Shutong personally served Master Xu, studying this scripture with such devotion that he remained awake through the nights, gazing at the celestial patterns of Qian to determine the workings of yin and yang. He established the positions of the hexagrams using Qian and Kun, aligned the trigrams with the sun and moon, and grounded his explanations in the imagery of the *Book of Changes*. Thus, the Master said: *"No suspended image is more luminous than the sun and moon."* Those who ingest this returning elixir all attain a lifespan coextensive with heaven and earth.

The sun is the fiery essence of Great Yang—this is the vermilion mercury, the Dragon. The moon is the watery essence of Great Yin—this is the lead-silver, the Tiger. These two treasures are the most numinous under heaven. Among the seventy-two minerals, none surpass lead and mercury. Responsive to the twenty-four qi and corresponding to the twenty-four names, they transform into the elixir. Those who consume it achieve longevity and ascend to the Purple Palace upon a dragon.

Cinnabar is the child of fire; quicksilver is the grandchild of metal. Metal is born of the sun; silver is nurtured by the moon. Sun and moon interact, water and fire unite, Dragon and Tiger complement each other, yin and yang restrain and subdue—thus is the Great Elixir formed. This Great Elixir comprises eight types divided into three grades.

The most exalted, the superior grade, includes the Divine Talisman of White Snow, the Nine-Turned Golden Liquor of the Great Return, and the Five Talismans of Transmuting Divine Water. Those who consume it ascend to heaven in broad daylight, and the eight stones and five metals are transformed into treasures.

The middle grade is crafted from the Golden Flower and Yellow Sprout, refined to produce the Purple Gold Cinnabar. Some versions multiply each month, known as the method of proper nurturance.

The inferior grade includes realgar, which pertains to earth and occupies the central palace. It is called the General, capable of subduing water. Malachite pertains to wood, brightens the eyes, nourishes the spirit, and transforms mercury into radiant cinnabar—this is called the Purple Gold Elixir. Among the eight elixirs, only these three methods are esteemed.

When crows consume it, they become phoenixes; when serpents ingest it, they become dragons. When humans partake, they attain longevity, sharing the lifespan of heaven and earth. It gathers the hun and po souls, reverses aging, and restores youth. It summons winds and commands clouds, and jade maidens attend in service. Such are the powers of the returning elixir.

Thus, Qian and Kun serve as the upper and lower crucibles; Kan and Li provide the water and fire for the medicine. Zhen and Gen govern the movement of the trigrams and the alignment of talismans. At the center, gold and mercury are stabilized, assisted by Golden Flower and Yellow Sprout. The Red Gate nurtures their completion, and after three years of firing, the elixir mirrors the natural returning elixir—then the qi of the Supreme Mystery is fulfilled. How could the elixir not be achieved?

The Great Elixir is formed when cinnabar transforms into mercury, mercury into gold, gold into cinnabar, and cinnabar into the elixir—hence the name *returning elixir*. *"Return"* signifies reverting to the original state; *"elixir"* denotes the crimson hue. Mercury, in its fundamental nature, is metal; after becoming cinnabar, it is called *gold cinnabar*. When it turns purple and crimson to form the elixir, returning to its original state, it is called the *Great Returning Elixir*.

The *Cantong Qi* elucidates these principles clearly, yet people fail to comprehend them thoroughly. Those who arrogantly impose their own interpretations inevitably meet with failure. Thus, they do not attain longevity or transcend the world—without the elixir, one cannot extend their years. If one ingests the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir, they ascend in clouds and transform into an immortal. Without consuming the golden cinnabar, one cannot ride the crane.

I have heard that the non-existent can generate the existent, and the existent can become the non-existent. Since both existence and non-existence are possible, why not consume the medicine of gold and mercury? Even the five grains can prolong life—how much more so the divine medicine of the golden elixir? Poisonous drugs can kill; how could the returning elixir not grant immortal longevity? If one lacks a steadfast heart, how could the Dao thwart their aspirations?

Why abandon the rosy complexion of youth and the brightness of day, allowing jade-like beauty to turn to dust? If one does not pursue longevity, they will swiftly become a ghost below. Only the principles of the returning elixir are made clear in the *Cantong Qi*. Yet, among the many commentaries by worthies, all remain veiled in secrecy.

I have studied its methods and grasped its essential meaning. Though I have endured hardship without complaint and suffered losses without resentment, my resolve remains fixed on the golden crucible. As I delved into the *Cantong Qi*, I often donned coarse robes and longed for the cloudy forests, my nature ever inclined toward the Daoist teachings. Though I dwell in the mundane world, my heart is not of it. I yearn for longevity and follow the arts of immortality, for the Dao does not betray one’s aspirations.

Suddenly, I encountered a Perfected One. The next morning, I received the transmission, personally learning the oral instructions. In a dream, a spirit imparted the method to me. I took up my brush to record it, and when the mercury was refined by fire, how could the returning elixir be mistaken?

I have long lamented those who study the Dao: they seek swift success without enduring the trials of the furnace, and upon encountering minor setbacks, they harbor deep resentment. Such individuals are tainted by impure habits, their minds a mix of right and wrong, wavering in indecision. Years pass, their blood and qi wither, and they swiftly return to the morning dew—how tragic! They bear only the name of Daoist practitioners, lacking the resolve to refine the elixir.

If there are scholars of pure and empty intent, whose natures are sincere and harmonious, who regard worldly affairs as scalding water and abandon their wives and children as easily as removing sandals—who perceive the fleeting nature of this floating life and recognize the enduring path of the Great Dao—then they may be entrusted with this scripture. They should study its principles diligently, undeterred by the certainty of success or failure.

Once achieved, they will see the seas shrink into hills and human life dissolve like foam. They will soar through the Great Void and wander freely within the workings of creation. This is not the work of heaven and earth but the power of the returning elixir. Simply seek the *Cantong Qi*, and you will surely grasp its origins. Trace the waves to their source—what cause for worry could remain?

Here now follows my translation:

My present commentary differs markedly from those of other schools. It unites the principles of the orthodox scriptures with the Great Dao, discusses hexagram images with firing times as the priority, and explains yin-yang with the elixir substances as the standard. Its matters are evident, its principles clear—so luminous upon reading that no doubt or confusion can remain. Thus may later gentlemen together return to the Great Dao. Is this not excellent?

*Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Scroll One
Commentary by Immortal Changsheng Yinzhen

Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yi*.
The *Xici* states: "Qian and Kun—are they not the gates of the *Yi*?"
Qian is yang.
Kun is yin.
Yin and yang unite their powers, and hardness and softness take form.
Yin-yang is qi.
Hardness and softness are form.
Receiving the qi of yin and yang, they complete the forms of metal and water.
*Yi* means transformation.
It images things appropriately.
Metal images Qian through its hardness and straightness; water images Kun through its softness and compliance. When metal and water unite in form, congealing into true firmness, this is transformation.
The nature of metal does not decay—this is the treasure of the myriad things, the unchanging.
The transformations of the myriad things must proceed from within yin and yang, just as people enter and exit through gates.

The parents of the hexagrams.
The *Yi* states: "Qian is Heaven, hence it is called the father. Kun is Earth, hence it is called the mother."
Zhen seeks once and obtains a male, hence it is called the eldest son.
Xun seeks once and obtains a female, hence it is called the eldest daughter.
Kan seeks twice and obtains a male, hence it is called the middle son.
Li seeks twice and obtains a female, hence it is called the middle daughter.
Gen seeks thrice and obtains a male, hence it is called the youngest son.
Dui seeks thrice and obtains a female, hence it is called the youngest daughter.
The parents of the hexagrams refer precisely to Qian and Kun.

Kan and Li form the enclosing frame, turning the hub and aligning the axle.
Kan is water; Li is fire.
The nature of fire is ever-moving; the nature of water is ever-still.
Stillness is likened to the axle; movement to the hub.
This speaks of the two qi of Kan and Li, containing and receiving the enclosing frame, revolving like hub and axle.
The *Zhongci* of the Kan hexagram states: "Practicing Kan is doubling peril. Water flows yet does not fill—this is because hardness resides within." This is water pouring into a vessel.
The *Zhongci* of the Li hexagram states: "Li means adherence. Hardness transforms into softness, hence it is smooth and penetrating." Adherence means attachment. Double brightness is yang; softness is yin. Fire attaches to the outside of the vessel; water attaches to the inside. When the qi of water and fire intermingle, only then do their natures become thoroughly communicated, and the treasure is transformed.
Kan contains abundant yang; Li contains abundant yin—this is also the meaning of the enclosing frame.

The four hexagrams of the female and male serve as the bellows and key, enveloping yin and yang.
Female and male mean the feminine and masculine.
Feminine and masculine mean yin and yang.
Qian and Kan are the two yang hexagrams; Kun and Li are the two yin hexagrams.
They seek the qi of water and fire, circulating it within.
Enveloping means wrapping and containing.
Metal is yang; water is yin.
One yin and one yang—this is the Dao of transformation.
The Dao is like a charioteer, holding the bit and reins, following the inked line and wheel tracks.
Abiding in the center to control the exterior, the reckoning lies in the calendar.
The one within the chariot is the lord.
The one drawing the chariot is the horse.
Though the horse is perfectly compliant, without the lord it cannot be controlled.
Though the lord is in the chariot, without the horse it cannot proceed.
Metal serves as the lord—it is hardness in the extreme.
Water serves as the horse—it is compliance in the utmost.
Metal abides within and moves in due season; water dwells without and revolves constantly.
Water desires to flee and scatter, but metal can restrain it.
Thus it is said: abide in the center to control the exterior.

The lunar phases have five or six days.
Five or six means thirty—this is the reckoning of one month.
Hardness and softness each take half: day is hard yang; night is soft yin.
The time when hardness and softness intermingle is precisely the moment when metal and water meet.

The warp and weft serve the sun’s commands, jointly unfolding the sixty-four hexagrams.
The *Baihu Tong* states: "The sun and moon are the warp; the five planets are the weft."
The moon is the essence of Great Yin, accumulating to form its image. Its corporeal substance and shadow receive the sun’s light to brightly illuminate the night.
The sun is the lord; the moon is the minister. Receiving the sun’s light, it is thus commanded by the sun.
Water receiving harmony from metal is likewise so.
"Jointly unfolding" refers to the *Yi* hexagrams’ combination of yin and yang.

Hardness and softness form the outer and inner.
The *Xici* states: "Yin and yang refer to their qi. Hardness and softness refer to their forms."
Transformation begins with qi and images, then afterward takes form.
Form is metal and water; qi is water and fire.
With the qi of water and fire, the forms of metal and water are transformed.

On the new moon, *Zhun* governs affairs.
The *Xu Gua* states: "*Zhun* means the beginning of a thing’s birth."
Wang Fusi says: "In this hexagram, yin seeks yang. The weak cannot cross on their own and must rely on the strong."
The weak is water; the strong is metal.
Once metal takes up its affairs, water comes to comply.
Metal can respond, and thus they intermingle.
The *Tuan* states: "Hardness and softness first intermingle, and difficulties arise. Moving within peril, great penetration and correctness."
Hardness is metal; softness is water.
Receiving the qi of water and fire, they intermingle. Moving within yang as water, they revolve within the vessel.
Smooth penetration and correctness.
Once yin and yang intermingle, only then do their natures become thoroughly communicated, and their correct nature is completed.
Correct nature refers precisely to the true treasure.
This speaks of the first day of the new moon, when the sun and moon are level at dawn.
"Governing affairs" means the person on duty carries out their tasks.
The *Dunjia Jing* states: "The eight gates govern affairs"—this is its meaning.

At the inception of yin and yang’s intermingling, amid the difficulties of *Zhun*, the *Zhun* hexagram governs affairs. By dusk, the *Meng* hexagram takes its turn.

The *Xugua* states: "All things at birth must be unformed, thus it is followed by *Meng*." *Meng* signifies the immaturity of things.

Wang Fusi says: In this hexagram, yin also first approaches yang. Yin is dim, yang is bright; yin confines the immature, while yang can rouse it. Not only in these two hexagrams, but from the eleventh month to the fourth month, pure yang governs affairs, and yin seeks yang.

The *Tuan* states: "It is not I who seek the immature, but the immature who seek me." "I" refers to yang, which is metal. The immature refers to yin, which is water. Metal governs affairs, and yin seeks yang. Water thus seeks it, hence: "the immature seek me."

The *Xiang* states: "Nine in the second place: Enveloping the immature brings good fortune. Taking a wife brings good fortune, for hardness and softness meet." Yang is male, yin is female; yin unites with yang, thus it speaks of "taking a wife." Hardness is metal; softness is water. When metal and water intermingle, hardness and softness unite.

Each hexagram governs day and night in sequence: *Zhun* by day, *Meng* by night. "The immature seek me"—*Zhun* signifies the inception of yin and yang’s intermingling, an unbroken cycle. From *Ji* to *Wei*, until dawn and dusk, the end returns to a new beginning. Dusk is obscurity, dawn is clarity. The month begins with brightness and ends in obscurity. From *Ji* to *Wei*, through dawn and dusk, day and night are governed by *Zhun* and *Meng*. *Zhun* and *Meng* embody the inception of metal and water’s intermingling.

The celestial stems and earthly branches mark the cycles; movement and stillness vary in earliness and lateness. The branches refer to the twelve hours; each branch, by the fifteenth day of the month, receives a *qi* and undergoes a minor transformation. With each reception of *qi*, a change occurs. In a year of twenty-four *qi*, the myriad things reach full formation. Metal and water receive *qi* and take form, their shapes following suit.

The sun moves slowly, traversing one degree per day; the moon moves swiftly, traversing thirteen degrees per day. The sun completes one celestial cycle in a year, the moon in a month. Metal resembles the sun, water resembles the moon; their slow and swift revolutions are likened to these. By measuring these degrees, one knows the cycles of movement. By observing this movement and stillness, one knows the earliness or lateness of coagulation. Movement and stillness refer to water and fire; earliness and lateness refer to civil and martial.

Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. *Zi*, *chou*, and *yin* are spring; *mao*, *chen*, and *si* are summer. In these six months, pure yang governs affairs, and yin seeks yang. Autumn and winter pertain to the outer use, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. *Wu*, *wei*, and *shen* are autumn; *you*, *xu*, and *hai* are winter. In these six months, pure yin governs affairs, and yang seeks yin. Thus, water has already coagulated and receives metal, while metal disperses and enters water.

Hexagrams possess inner and outer bodies: the inner is the lower three lines of yang, the outer is the upper three lines of yin. The upper three serve as the function of the lower three. Fu Xi drew the hexagrams, beginning with three lines to symbolize heaven, earth, and humanity—termed the Three Powers. Yet this did not exhaust the fittingness of heaven and earth’s things, so he doubled them, drawing three more lines. The inner became the body, the outer the function. Spring and summer rely on the inner body, corresponding to *Qian*’s *initial nine*, *nine in the second place*, and *nine in the third place*. Autumn and winter pertain to the outer use, corresponding to *Kun*’s *initial six*, *six in the second place*, and *six in the third place*. In times of yang, water seeks metal; in times of yin, metal seeks water. Metal resides within, water without; the boundary between inner and outer is taken from the hexagrams.

Rewards and punishments align with spring and autumn. Spring gives life to the myriad things, like heaven’s bestowal of rewards; autumn kills the hundred grasses, like heaven’s meting of punishments. When fire *qi* moves, metal and water surge and merge—this is spring. When water *qi* moves, metal and water coagulate—this is autumn.

Dawn and dusk follow cold and heat. Though day and night govern, they do not contravene cold and heat. In cold, civil measures are used; in heat, martial measures. By following the seasons, one does not violate the Dao of heaven.

Line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accord with the times. Lines are the strokes. Benevolence and righteousness are yin and yang. Within the six lines of a hexagram, there are yin and yang: yang gives life to things, thus it is called benevolence; yin completes things, thus it is called righteousness. In yang, there is ease, hence joy; in yin, there is severity, hence anger. It is like metal rejoicing when it receives water *qi*, and water raging when it receives fire *qi*.

The *Xici* states: "Forbidding wrongdoing is called righteousness." This means restraining metal and water to prevent their overflow. Thus, the *qi* of the four seasons is harmonized, and the Five Phases attain their principles. The four seasons are spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the Five Phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. By harmonizing the *qi* of the four seasons and following the functions of the Five Phases, metal and water do not lose their fittingness.

Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them. The *Xici* states: "Heaven is noble, earth is base; *Qian* and *Kun* are thus determined. Noble and base are arrayed, and the positions of high and low are set." Once heaven and earth are established, the *Yi* arises within them. Heaven and earth refer to yin and yang; when yin and yang intermingle, the myriad things transform and are born. That yin and yang intermingle and the myriad things transform and are born is the meaning of *change*. Metal and water are heaven and earth; water and fire are *change*.

Heaven and earth are *Qian* and *Kun*. Heaven and earth are forms; *Qian* and *Kun* are *qi*. They begin with the images of *qi*, then take form—just as metal and water receive the *qi* of water and fire, then take form.

The establishment of positions refers to the arrangement of yin and yang in their paired positions. Yin bestows and yang receives—this is called *pairing*, which is precisely the intermingling of metal and water. The *Yi* speaks of *Kan* and *Li* as the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions have no fixed line positions, circulating through the six voids. *Qian* and *Kun* are the functions of heaven and earth; *Kan* and *Li* are the functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. The four directions and above and below constitute the six voids—this speaks of the vessel’s interior, not the six line positions. *Kan* and *Li* are the *qi* of water and fire; *Qian* and *Kun* are the forms of metal and water. Form possesses substance and is solid, while *qi* is formless and operates in concealment. Circulating within the six voids is the meaning of transformation. Within these two functions, metal and water are employed, hence they have no fixed line positions. The *Xici* states: "Transforming and moving without abiding, circulating through the six voids. Above and below have no constancy, the firm and yielding interchange." This is the meaning of the transformation of metal and water, water and fire. Since their coming and going are not fixed, above and below also have no constancy. The *qi* of water and fire steam together, the forms of metal and water constantly turn—naturally, their coming and going are not fixed, and above and below have no constancy. Concealed and hidden, they ascend and transform within. Water, receiving fire, rises and soars; metal, dwelling in water, lies concealed—alternately transforming, they congeal within the vessel. Enveloping the myriad things, they become the warp and woof of the Dao. The warp is yang, the woof is yin. This speaks of the warp and woof as yin above and yang below. Enveloping the myriad things refers to heaven and earth; becoming the warp and woof of the Dao refers to yin and yang. Enveloping metal and water refers to the crucible; becoming the warp and woof of the vessel refers to water and fire. Using the insubstantial to regulate the substantial, the vessel’s function is emptiness. The substance of metal and water is substantial; the *qi* of water and fire is insubstantial. When the *qi* of water and fire intermingle, the forms of metal and water naturally unite. Employing these two *qi* is equivalent to emptiness and nothingness. Thus, in the ebb and flow, *Kan* and *Li* vanish and perish. The *Yi zhengyi* states: "Those who can ebb and flow must focus without fail"—this refers to the ebb and flow of water and fire. Ebbing and flowing with the seasons, metal and water harmonize; ebbing and flowing out of season, water and fire clash. Water and fire are *Kan* and *Li*. *Vanishing and perishing* does not mean water is exhausted. When the sun sets, the moon rises; when the moon sets, the sun emerges—this speaks of yin and yang circulating and employing one another. Words are not idly crafted, theories do not arise in vain. The *Cantong qi* relies on the perfect words of these three sages to exhaust the transformations of yin and yang—it does not fail to follow antiquity, nor does it idly produce this text. Drawing on evidence and verifying effects, it measures and calibrates. The sun and moon are the verification of metal and water; yin and yang are the measure of spirit and illumination. To know the union of metal and water, simply observe the movements of the sun and moon. The mutual pushing of the sun and moon is called *change*; the unfathomable of yin and yang is called *spirit*. Extending by analogy and structuring the characters, the principle serves as proof. The character *yi* is formed by placing the moon beneath the sun. The analogy refers to using the dragon to represent *Qian* and the horse to represent *Kun*. *Kan* is the essence of the moon, *Wu*; *Li* is the radiance of the sun, *Ji*. *Kan* is water, *Li* is fire. *Wu* is yin, *Ji* is yang. The essence of yang accumulates to become fire; the essence of fire accumulates to become the sun. The essence of yin accumulates to become water; the essence of water accumulates to become the moon. Thus it is said: *Kan* is the essence of the moon, *Wu*; *Li* is the radiance of the sun, *Ji*. As if returning, the *qi* of water and fire steam the forms of metal and water. The sun and moon become *yi*, the firm and yielding unite. Placing the moon beneath the sun forms the character *yi*. Day is firm, night is yielding. Metal and water resemble the union of the sun and moon, completing a year’s congealment. Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving from beginning to end. The sun and moon unite once each month, twelve unions completing a year. Earth has no fixed form, constantly flourishing in the four seasons—this refers to the four sides of the crucible. Beginning and ending, they weave together. Green, red, white, and black each reside in their respective directions—all are the achievements of *Ji* in the central palace. On the four sides of the crucible, the spirits are drawn according to their directions. The Azure Dragon of the east is the essence of wood; the Vermilion Bird of the south is the essence of fire; the White Tiger of the west is the essence of metal; the Dark Warrior of the north is the essence of water; the central *Wu* and *Ji* are the essence of earth. Thus, earth fills the vessel, and these four spirits are drawn to prevent the escape of metal and water. Only earth can restrain water—hence it is called the achievement of *Wu* and *Ji*. The text below states: "Water regards earth as its ghost; earth fills water so it does not rise." The *Yi* is imagery. No imagery is more luminous than the suspended images of the sun and moon. Imagery is that which images the appropriateness of things. *Li* is the sun, *Kan* is the moon. The sun and moon are the essence of water and fire. In the movement of heaven’s Dao, nothing precedes the sun and moon. Day is the firmness of yang, the sun’s norm. Night is the yielding of yin, the moon’s achievement. In the employment of metal and water, nothing precedes water and fire. The essence of water and fire is the sun and moon. The myriad things are not born without the sun and moon; metal and water are not formed without water and fire. Exhausting spirit to know transformation, when yang departs, yin arrives. The *Xici* states: "The unfathomable of yin and yang is called *spirit*; the alternation of yin and yang is called the *Dao*." Those who can exhaust the Dao of yin and yang know the source of transformation. Metal and water are the source of transformation; water and fire are the Dao of yin and yang. Yin and yang come and go, clashing to form treasure. The Master said: "Those who know the Dao of change know where spirit acts." Converging like spokes at a hub, the wheel turns—entering and exiting, rolling and unrolling. This refers to the *qi* of water and fire contending and converging within the vessel, steaming the forms of metal and water, like a wheel constantly turning.

When water-qi enters, fire-qi coils; when fire-qi enters, water-qi unfurls. Though unfurling and coiling, they never leave the vessel. The hexagrams contain three hundred eighty-four lines; selecting lines to extract the tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams. A *line* is a stroke. *Extracting* means distinguishing. One hexagram has six strokes; sixty-four hexagrams total three hundred eighty-four strokes, corresponding to the number of a *jin*. One *jin* of metal contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. In the interplay of metal-water and water-fire, some resemble hexagram forms, some resemble line statements—though the line images differ, they do not exceed the sixty-four hexagrams.

At every new-moon dawn, *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally. Each month at the new moon, earth-qi stirs and rises above the ground, which is why the *Zhen* hexagram occupies its position. The *Xiang* commentary of *Zhen* states: *"Zhen* is perilous, completing firmness." *Zhen* means movement; *peril* means danger. Yin is above and yang below; once yang ascends, softness transforms into firmness. Yin residing above yang is perilous. Water above metal is riding firmness. When fire is obtained, movement occurs—constantly perilous. The method of awaiting qi involves placing twelve pitch-pipes according to the spirits, filling them with reed pith ash, and spreading them over a silk screen. When qi arrives, it blows the ash. By observing this, one confirms its verification.

At this moment, Heaven and Earth unite their essence.

The *Xici* states: "Heaven and Earth intermingle in profound embrace, and the myriad things transform into purity; male and female unite their essence, and the myriad things come into being." Heaven and Earth are male and female; essence and qi are yin and yang. When male and female join in union, essence and qi unfold. When male and female interact, essence and qi become things.

Metal and Water are Heaven and Earth; essence and qi are Water and Fire. When Metal and Water respond to the essence of Water and Fire, they transform into the true treasure—this occurs precisely at the moment when Water and Fire stir in movement. When Metal and Water conjoin their essence and qi, the qi does not move merely once a month. In a single day and night, there are also the qi of yin and yang.

The Sun and Moon mutually sustain one another. "Sustaining" resembles the motion of a shuttle. The Sun and Moon are the functions of Heaven and Earth. The qi of Heaven and Earth intersect and rely on the movement of the Sun and Moon. It is just as Metal and Water require the transformation of Water and Fire.

The potent yang scatters its dark essence, while the yielding yin transforms into the yellow hue. The *Wenyan* of *Kun* states: "The dark and yellow are the blended colors of Heaven and Earth." Heaven is dark, Earth is yellow—this is the interaction of yin and yang. The potent yang is the most yang within yang; the yielding yin is the most yin within yin. When the fierce yang qi is released, the gentle water’s form subtly shifts. Through one cycle of cold and heat, it transforms into the yellow sprouts—this is what is meant.

In the primordial chaos of divine union, the root foundation is established. Before Heaven and Earth separated, it was called *hundun*. During the time of *hundun*, Qian and Kun were silent. Though no transformation had yet occurred, it ultimately became the root of the myriad things. This is the moment when Metal and Water are profoundly still, serving as the foundation of returning cinnabar.

Through nurturing and tending the budding sprout, the spirit congeals to form the pivot. "Nurturing" describes the movement of cultivation. "Budding sprout" refers to the rugged edges. By applying the workings of Water and Fire, one enhances the beauty of the rugged edges. When the spirit’s principle congeals in stillness, it naturally forms its pivot. The pivot is the qi of the returning cinnabar’s edge.

The multitude treads forth, and no creeping thing fails to follow. "The multitude" refers to the people; "creeping things" denote all beings with spirit. All exist within Heaven and Earth, shaped by its molding influence. Metal and Water, Water and Fire—all emerge from yin and yang. Whether in action or non-action, none depart from this Way.

Thus, Confucius first penetrated the *hongmeng*. Qian and Kun attained profound emptiness. Confucius, styled Zhongni, explored the *Ten Wings* to elucidate the obscure, revealing the profound subtleties of the *Yi*’s Way. Only after distinguishing the principles of *hundun* could the virtue of Qian and Kun be perceived, thereby comprehending the emotions of all things.

Without relying on the text of the *Cantong Qi*, how could one grasp the principle of returning cinnabar? Investigating antiquity, one gazes upon the primordial sovereigns. The *Guanju* establishes the beginning.

"Investigating" means to examine. "Primordial sovereigns" refers to the Heavenly Sovereign. When examining the age of the Heavenly Sovereign in high antiquity, male and female united without seeking one another. From the Yellow Emperor onward, male and female did not unite without seeking—this is the meaning of the *Guanju*.

The *Book of Songs* says:
*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
On the islet in the river.
The modest, retiring, virtuous young lady—
For our prince a good mate she.

"Mate" means partner, signifying the seeking of a virtuous maiden to match the noble man. Metal is the male; Water is the female. When Metal first moves, Water responds—this is the male seeking the female.

At the time of capping and marriage, when qi intertwines, the first year brings forth sprouting growth. When a man and woman unite in capping and marriage, their essence and qi intertwine, gradually growing into a body—just as a nine-tiered terrace begins with a single mound of earth. The "first year" is the beginning of the year. The myriad things sprout and gradually flourish, their abundance beyond calculation. Is not the mutual resonance of Metal and Water just like this?

The sage is not born in vain; he observes above to manifest the celestial tally. The "sage" refers to Fuxi. When Fuxi drew the Eight Trigrams, he looked up to observe the patterns of Heaven, looked down to examine the principles of Earth, and considered the suitability of the myriad things, along with the markings of birds and beasts. Drawing near, he took from his own body; looking afar, he took from external things. Thus, he first created the Eight Trigrams to communicate the virtue of the divine luminaries and to categorize the emotions of the myriad things. The "celestial tally" refers to the seven luminaries aligned with the Five Phases—this is the beginning of returning cinnabar.

The celestial tally advances and retreats, flexes and extends in accordance with the seasons. The *Xici* states: "Transformation is the image of advance and retreat. That which departs is withdrawal; that which arrives is extension. Withdrawal and extension interact, giving rise to benefit and harm." This refers to the Sun, Moon, and Five Stars, as well as yin and yang, day and night. Thus, through the mutual resonance of firmness and softness, the myriad things are born; through the mutual resonance of Metal and Water, the true treasure is completed.

Therefore, the *Yi* unites the heart of Heaven, and the *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning of sprouting. *Fu* means the return of yin and yang to their root. Heaven and Earth possess a heart of non-action—non-action is the root of Heaven and Earth. The *Yi* states: "*Fu* brings prosperity. There is no illness in going out or coming in." "Prosperity" means penetration. On the day of the winter solstice, the qi of yin and yang returns beneath the earth, and at the moment of penetration, there is no illness in going out or coming in.

It also states: "*Fu*—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?" Moreover, when thunder moves and wind blows, undergoing a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, the ultimate state of profound stillness is their root. The root is the heart of Heaven and Earth. *Fu* is not still yet becomes still of itself—thus, the heart of Heaven and Earth is visible.

In the eleventh month, a single yang line stirs beneath the Yellow Springs, and the myriad things begin to sprout—hence it is said to begin at the sprout. At this time, Metal lies below, occupying the position of the first yang; Water resides above, dwelling in the position of the five yins. Yin transforms for yang, gradually forming solid ice. When both Metal and Water have concealed themselves, this is the moment of non-action.

The non-action is the root of the Great Dao. Attaining the One is the achievement of the Returned Elixir. Without the Returned Elixir, none can align with the Dao—only through thoughtless non-action. Not grasping at action, utterly still and unmoving: this is the true principle of non-action.

The eldest son inherits the father’s body, establishing the foundation through the mother. *Zhen* is the eldest son of *Qian*. The Master said: "*Zhen* seeks once and obtains it—male—thus it is called the eldest son." *Zhen* resides in the east, the position of pure yang, inheriting *Qian*’s achievement to nurture the myriad things. The essence of the myriad things is that without movement, none are born—hence it is called the eldest son. "Through the mother" refers to the *Zhen* hexagram, where two yins above gradually transform into yang, thus called the mother. A single yang stirs below at its inception—this is the sprout. *Zhao* means foundation.

Metal is the eldest son. Lead is the father, the essence of the five metals, born of metal—hence called the eldest son. The mother is water. Metal transforms through the mother, reverting to metal: this is the meaning of "through the mother."

Waxing and waning follow the pitch-pipes; ascent and descent depend on the Dipper’s pivot. *Xiao-xi* means observation. Observing metal and water, attaining the timing of yin and yang, requires measuring the twelve pitch-pipes. The pipes gauge the patterns of heaven; the pitch-standards measure the qi of earth. In applying fire, one observes accordingly. When metal receives the qi of water and fire, its ascent and descent revolve like the pivot star’s movement. To know the vessel’s inner state, one need only observe this for verification.

On the third day, brightness emerges—*Zhen* receives *geng* in the west. *Shuang* means brightness. After the moon’s third day, light appears, emerging from the west in the *geng* region. When fire moves for three days, its qi reaches the vessel. At this time, water also resides in *geng*. Water is yin, the moon’s image. Carefully observing the moon’s birth reveals water’s movement and stillness—hence it is said *Zhen* receives *geng* in the west.

On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*—the first quarter is level as a string. The moon’s eighth day marks the first quarter, resembling a bow’s hanging string, level as a cord. On the eighth day, the moon appears in the south at *ding*—metal follows accordingly. Metal is the ruler, slow in movement, thus taking eight days to progress. Water is the minister, swift in movement, thus traversing in three days. The circulation of metal and water verifies this timing.

On the fifteenth day, the *Qian* body is complete—fullness fills *jia* in the east. By the fifteenth day, the moon emerges in the east at *jia*, round and full. At this time, metal unites with water at *jia*, receiving a single qi and taking metal’s form. The toad and hare’s shadows: the dual qi of sun and moon. The toad and hare both dwell in the moon. *Ying* denotes the appearance of light. By the fifteenth day, the qi of one creature shines doubly in the moon; on other days, it wanes and cannot fully manifest. Every fifteen days, the myriad things each receive a single qi. When this qi arrives, the forms of metal and water also become doubly bright, taking their image from the two creatures.

The toad gazes at the hexagram’s node; the hare spits forth radiance. The *Baihu Tong* states: "The hare is *tu* (spitting)." It speaks of its spitting forth the moon’s radiant essence. When the toad appears, the moon is full; when the toad vanishes, the moon wanes. This serves as the sign for metal and water.

When the seven-eight count is complete, it bends and descends. After fifteen days, the moon gradually wanes, returning its achievement to the sun and receiving the mandate to circulate anew. Metal receives water’s mandate and begins its circuit again.

On the sixteenth, it turns to receive the mandate—*Xun* at *xin* sees dawn. The moon is the minister; the sun, the ruler. Thus, the moon receives the sun’s light, forming its soul by the third day, its radiance by the eighth, and returning its achievement to the sun by the sixteenth to receive the mandate and circulate again. The moon emerges from *xun* and, by *xin* at dawn, metal receives water’s mandate—returning like the sun’s transformation of the moon.

*Gen* aligns with *bing* in the south—on the twenty-third, the last quarter. On the twenty-third day, the last quarter arrives as the moon nears its end, resembling its initial birth. At this time, the moon emerges from *gen* and, by *bing* at dawn, serves as the sign for water.

On the thirtieth day, *Kun* at *yi*—in the northeast, it loses its companion. By the thirtieth day, the moon emerges at *yi* and sets in *kun*. *Kun* is yin—thus it is said to gain a companion in the northeast and southwest. Hence, it is said to lose its companion: water flows from the northeast to the southwest, both losing their companion.

When the node is exhausted, they alternate and yield—inheriting the body, the dragon is reborn. The node’s exhaustion marks the moon’s end. *Chan-yu* means yin yielding its position to yang. The moon’s end is yin; its beginning, yang. Yang is the dragon. Inheriting yin’s body, yang is reborn—hence it is said "inheriting the body, the dragon is reborn." Metal inherits water’s body and is reborn in yang. Yang is the qi of fire. Wang Fusi said: "The dragon is likened to *Qian*; the horse, to *Kun*—following their kind."

*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*—*Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end. *Kuo* means to bind. *Ren* and *gui* (water) pair with *Kun*; *jia* and *yi* (yang) pair with *Qian*. This speaks of a month’s division, with yin and yang each occupying half. The binding of the myriad things truly lies in yin and yang. Yin and yang are the qi of water and fire—thus they form the shapes of metal and water. The *Xici* states: "*Qian* knows the great beginning; *Kun* brings things to completion." This is the meaning of beginning and end.

Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond. Seven and nine are yang numbers; six and eight, yin numbers. Yin and yang pair to complete a month. The transformations of metal and water, water and fire, are likewise. The four combine to make thirty—*yi*’s qi seeks concealment.

The four refer to seven, eight, nine, and six, which together complete thirty days. The Dao of transformation follows yin and yang: when yin arrives, it conceals; when yang arrives, it emerges. The eight trigrams are arrayed and radiant, their movements never losing the center. The eight trigrams are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Dui*. As the eight trigrams are arrayed, yin and yang circulate. When yin and yang are harmonious, the central Way is never lost—just as with metal and water, which employ the qi of water and fire without losing their vessel.

The primordial essence is subtle and difficult to perceive; one infers and measures it through signs and verification. The primordial essence is the primordial qi. The *Yi* states: "The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the sun and moon; the sun and moon generate the four seasons; the four seasons generate the Five Phases; the Five Phases generate the twelve months; the twelve months generate the twenty-four qi. Fifteen days form a solar term; two solar terms form a month. Four seasons form a year, cycling endlessly." To infer and measure refers to the sun and moon; to verify through signs refers to the eight trigrams. The primordial qi is distant and invisible in form, so one infers the sun and moon to gauge cold and heat, and observes the hexagrams to discern fortune and misfortune—just as metal and water receive essence and qi within their vessel, their appearance unseen, yet measured through cold and heat, the sun and moon, and hexagram images. All else follows this pattern.

Abiding, one observes its images and models its forms. The *Xici* states: "Looking up, one observes the images in the heavens." The images refer to the sun, moon, five planets, and twenty-eight constellations. When the sun and moon unite, metal and water unite; when metal and water unite, the inner and outer forms become visible. Erecting a gnomon serves as a standard to divine and determine fortune and misfortune. The standard is the method: establishing the sun and moon as a model, the coagulation of metal and water can then be awaited and known. The *Xici* states: "Fortune and misfortune are the images of gain and loss; regret and remorse are the images of anxiety and apprehension." Once there is loss, regret and remorse arise; when regret and remorse arise, anxiety and apprehension follow. Carefully awaiting the waxing and waning, lest anxiety and apprehension arise, the Reverted Elixir may then be seen.

Issuing commands in accord with the seasons, do not miss the time of moving lines. After the winter solstice, one yang line stirs beneath the Yellow Springs. Kindling the fire at this time may be called following the season’s propriety. Above, examine the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, sequence the flows of earthly forms. In the center, investigate human sentiments, and through comparison, consider the Three Powers. The celestial patterns refer to fire; earthly forms refer to water; human sentiments refer to observing civil and martial signs. Fire flames below, water flows above, and human sentiments await within—thus the Dao of the Three Ultimates is complete.

In movement, follow the nodes of the trigrams; in stillness, emulate the *Xiang* Commentary. The *Zhen* trigram is movement; the *Fu* trigram is stillness. Fire flames and moves, following its trigram; water flows and is still, emulating its commentary. The *Tuan* Commentary of *Fu* states: "*Fu*—is this not the manifestation of the heart of Heaven and Earth?" Heaven and Earth are still, which is called non-action. Only after *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice does the world attain its principle—how could one not be cautious? This is the foundation of governance. The *Wenyan* of *Qian* states: "Riding the six dragons to govern Heaven." The Dao of *Qian* transforms and changes, each rectifying its nature and destiny. *Qian* and *Kun* are the functions of Heaven and Earth. When *Qian* and *Kun* operate, the myriad things are transformed and born, and the things of the world each attain their principle. Water and fire emulate this without losing their propriety, so metal and water attain their principle.

The method of the Reverted Elixir lies in tightly sealing the vessel’s opening to ensure firmness and density. Then, metal and water flow freely, delighting in yin and yang, and thus able to perfect their authenticity without error. The essential Dao is the handle of the Great Dipper, the guiding thread of transformation.

The *Jinhai* states: The Northern Dipper’s seven stars, with one auxiliary star, form the Imperial Chariot of the Supreme Tenuity and the Northern Dipper. It revolves at the center, overseeing the four directions, distinguishing yin and yang, and establishing the four seasons. The handle governs the Five Agents, shifting in accordance with the seasonal measures, and fixes all guiding principles. The emissary of the Great Unity: the first through fourth stars form the *Kui*, the fifth through seventh the handle, together making the Dipper. It resides in yin to distribute yang, hence called the Northern Dipper. As *Kaiyang* is a double treasure, an auxiliary star is placed beside it. The first star above the Dipper governs Heaven’s position, the second Earth, the third fire, the fourth water, the fifth soil, the sixth wood, and the seventh metal—thus the sun and moon meet therein. If one follows the Dipper, the Five Agents are known. By aligning with the Five Agents, the guiding principles naturally stand. Once the guiding principles are established, what worry remains that metal, water, and fire will not be ordered?

When the lines and images stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without. The arrayed hexagrams are the lines and images. When the lines and images move within, fortune and misfortune appear without. Thus, metal and water take their standard from the lines and images. Fortune means metal can retain water; misfortune means water flees. Between these two lies water and fire. A slight misstep in timing, and misfortune descends.

The five planets move in harmony or discord, responding to the seasons and stirring in resonance. The *Yisi Zhan* says: The sun and moon are the warp, the five planets the weft. The five planets are water, fire, metal, wood, and soil. When the five planets move in sequence, yin and yang are harmonized. When they move erratically, yin and yang reverse, and the lands they traverse suffer no lack of calamity. If water and fire are harmonized, metal and water follow. If water and fire are not regulated, metal and water perish. In these stirrings of resonance, this serves as the omen.

The four and seven fall into disorder, extravagance, and displacement. The four and seven are the twenty-eight lunar lodges. Disorder means deviation; extravagance means loss of position. The twenty-eight lodges correspond to the Five Agents’ passage, yet all deviate and lose their places—this is the image of metal, water, and fire. The *Wenchang Zonglu* holds them accountable, interrogating the ministers of the terrace. The *Yisi Zhan* states: The six stars of *Wenchang* lie before the *Kui* of the Northern Dipper, governing the officials of cultural virtue throughout the world—namely, metal, wood, water, fire, soil, and grain. The fifth star is the Controller of the Center, overseeing the interrogation of faults. The sixth is the Controller of Emoluments, assisting in the proclamation of treasures and also governing the reckoning of fortune and misfortune.

The three terraces consist of six stars, rising and residing in pairs. *Wenchang* moves, bearing the Supreme Tenuity. When the steps of the Supreme Tenuity are level, yin and yang are harmonized, wind and rain follow their course. The auxiliary star lies beside the handle of the Northern Dipper. When the position of the chief minister is bright, the four seasons proceed in order, and the Five Agents are ordered. The five planets, twenty-eight lodges, three terraces, and auxiliary star are all governed by *Wenchang*. When yin and yang follow the seasons, the multitude of stars receive their mandate and resume their courses. When yin and yang exceed their bounds, *Wenchang* interrogates them for their faults. These words all take their images from the furnace fire within. *Wenchang* is the image of soil. Yin and yang are water, fire, wood, and metal. Among these four, soil can restrain them—thus are analogies broadly drawn to magnify its efficacy.

The hundred officials and their bureaus each oversee their respective domains. The *Shenshu Lingxia* states: The Pillar Scribe, one star, records faults; the Three Dukes, three stars, proclaim virtue and transformation; the Nine Ministers, three stars, govern all affairs; the Five Secretaries, five stars, receive counsel; the Advisors and Grand Judges, two stars, oversee penal matters; the remaining officials each have their positions. Fearing prolixity, they are not all recorded here. The officials of the Central Kingdom all take their images from these. This refers to the spirits of the five directions, the essences of water and fire, each having its governance.

The sun unites the essences of the Five Agents; the moon receives the records of the six pitch-pipes. The *Yisi Zhan* says: The sun, moon, and five planets meet once a month. In the noon month, they receive the qi of the pitch-pipes and also unite with the sun. Metal, wood, water, and fire each take their effects from this. Five times six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. The sun moves one degree per day; the moon moves thirteen degrees per day and then unites with the sun, proceeding after their conjunction. The moon’s beginning is yang; its end is yin. Within a month, yin and yang begin anew, ending and then beginning again—like the circulation of metal and water, an image of the turning wheel. Origin and end, the threads of existence and extinction: the beginning is yang, the end is yin. The Dao of yin and yang is called civil and martial. When civil and martial follow the seasons, metal and water are preserved. When civil and martial are not regulated, metal and water flee. Existence and extinction, beginning and end—all lie in water and fire.

If the ruler is arrogant and excessive, reaching the extreme and violating the Dao: the ruler is metal. *Kang* means extremity. When metal receives the qi of fierce martiality to excess, it reaches the extreme and does not follow the proper Dao. What is the proper Dao if not the Reverted Elixir? If the minister is treacherous and obsequious, acting without following the proper path: the minister is water. When water receives the qi of rigid yang and flows unchecked without following the proper path, it is not the Dao, and treacherous obsequiousness is thereby manifest. This is the image of ruler and minister. They must ensure that metal and water are mutually attained, truly relying on water and fire following the seasons.

The waxing and waning of the crescents and full moon portend changes, regrets, and faults. The moon: the eighth day is the first crescent, the twenty-third the last crescent, the fifteenth the full moon. The full moon is when the sun and moon face each other. When the moon’s waxing and waning and its degrees are unclear, the timing of metal and water is difficult to know. When regrets and faults exceed their bounds, calamity arises. The enforcers of the law criticize and reprove, investigating faults and shifting responsibility. The *Jinhai* states: The Supreme Tenuity, ten stars, *Yi*, and *Miao*—this is the court of the Son of Heaven, the mansion of the feudal lords.

The constellations receive their mandates, and the various spirits examine the seasons. In the southern array, one star is called the *Gate of Uprightness*. To the east is the *Left Enforcer of the Law*, symbolizing the *Minister of Justice*. To the west is the *Right Enforcer of the Law*, symbolizing the *Imperial Censor*. These are the ones who expose and impeach the wicked and treacherous. When the Five Planets, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the various miscellaneous stars deviate from their proper paths, failing to follow the cycles of yin and yang, the Left and Right Enforcers of the Law expose their transgressions and shift their governance.

The governed is metal; the enforcers are fire. If metal cannot restrain water, fire’s qi is employed to press and expel it. The *Pivot of the Celestial Sphere* receives its rectification, moving leisurely and entrusting matters below.

The *Yisi Divination* states: The five stars of the *North Pole* are called the *Northern Asterism*. They are the center of Heaven, by which the four seasons are regulated. Though the heavens revolve without cease, the Pole Star does not move. It contains radiance and emits qi, using the *Dipper* to distribute constancy. It governs the mandate and regulates the seasons, as the numinous and luminous flow forth their essence, giving rise to the One that presides over the *Yellow Emperor*.

The *Pivot of the Celestial Sphere* is the image of metal. When metal lies within the vessel, it moves at ease, leisurely enduring the steaming of water and fire, naturally forming its true body. When the *Hall of Luminous Governance* embodies virtue, the state is free from harmful ways.

The *Hall of Luminous Governance* consists of three stars, the office from which the Son of Heaven enacts governance. The *Hall of Luminous Governance* is the image of the vessel; metal is the image of the ruler. When metal resides within the vessel, cultivating virtue, the steaming of water and fire does no harm. Within, it nurtures the self, tranquil and empty of desire.

"Within" refers to the interior of the vessel. When metal and water naturally settle within the vessel, still and inactive, they become one with emptiness and non-being. The original essence, though hidden, inwardly illuminates the form. This refers to metal emerging from ore: though metal shines brightly within, outwardly it appears dull and ignorant. Seal its aperture and fortify the numinous root.

The root is the foundation; the aperture is the mouth of the vessel. The foundation is metal and water. Metal and water are the root of the *Returning Elixir*, hence called the *Numinous Root*. Securely seal the vessel’s mouth, allowing no deviation, however slight. Though metal and water are numinous, they cannot flow away.

The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the *Child Pearl*. The sun, moon, and stars are the Three Luminaries. The sun is the yang luminosity; the stars and moon are the yin luminosity. Yang is metal; yin is water. Both lie concealed within the vessel. The *Child Pearl* is to cherish the child as a pearl. Metal is born of water; water is the child of metal, receiving qi and thus preserved. Hence, it is called *warming and nurturing the Child Pearl*.

Though unseen when observed, it is easily sought when near. This refers to metal and water within the vessel, which cannot be directly perceived. Yet they are ever present within water and fire. The *Returning Elixir* is easily attained.

Within the yellow, principles gradually interpenetrate, and moisture suffuses the skin. The *Wenyan* of the *Kun* hexagram states: "The noble one is centered in yellow, principles interpenetrate, and he occupies his proper position. Excellence resides within, extending to the four limbs, manifesting in affairs—this is the height of beauty." Water is white; metal is yellow. When metal enters water, their essences intermingle. Metal transforms water, giving it the color of the body, not merely the yellow center but also the skin.

Naturally, it moistens the whole, and beauty extends to the four limbs. At first, rectification ensures that the end follows the beginning, but it cannot yet be grasped. Yang is the trunk; yin is the limbs—this refers to metal and water. Though metal initiates, water’s power is still weak and cannot be relied upon to form the true and real. Yet if the fire is initially correct, then the first month is rectified, and the entire year can be known. Beginning and end cycle endlessly, replacing one another.

The One is concealed, unknown to the common people. The One refers to water. Water’s number is one, and water veils the vessel’s top, controlling it to prevent escape. Yet the people of the world know nothing of this Dao, vainly squandering their wealth.

The *Power of Supreme Virtue* is non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. The *Power of Lesser Virtue* acts, its function unceasing. The *Power of Supreme Virtue* refers to water; the *Power of Lesser Virtue* refers to fire. Water is profoundly still, the embodiment of non-action. Fire blazes and is ever in motion, the origin of action. Abiding in the realm of non-action, it naturally seeks non-action. In the time of action, its use is unceasing.

When the upper is sealed, it is called *being*; when the lower is sealed, it is called *non-being*. The upper is water; the lower is fire. Fire ascends through qi; those who employ qi are empty. Without water as its substance, the position of the manifest is for use. Non-being serves the upper, where the numinous power resides.

The numinous power is water; the qi of fire is non-being. Non-being flames upward, condensing water and circulating the qi of water and fire for the use of the *Returning Elixir*. These two apertures follow the method, and their breaths mutually require one another. The two apertures are warp and weft, the upper and lower mouths, which must correspond. The upper mouth is near water; the lower mouth presses fire. The qi of water and fire harmonize with one another. When harmony is proper and fitting, the body of metal is completed.

Know the white and guard the black, and the numinous will come of itself. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is black; metal is white. The essence of metal is the *Yellow Sprout*. To prevent water from flowing away, nothing precedes the essence of metal. The numinous is that which wondrously brings forth the ten thousand things. When things reach their utmost wonder, they transform into the true, as if the numinous descends without trace.

Water is the pivot of the Dao; its number is named One. Among the Five Phases, water’s number is one. Water can transform, serving as the pivot of the Dao. It is the beginning of yin and yang, the dark containing the *Yellow Sprout*. The dark is water; the *Yellow Sprout* is the essence of metal. When metal and water first unite, it is the beginning of yin and yang.

Metal is the master of the Five Metals; the *River Chariot* is in the north. The *River Chariot* is the essence of the Five Metals, another name for lead. Thus, lead is black without but holds golden splendor within. Cloaked in coarse garb, it conceals jade—outwardly a madman.

Lead, though black without, bears within the image of golden splendor—like a man who conceals jade, clad in coarse cloth while feigning madness. Metal is the mother of water; the mother hides within the child’s womb, while water, the child, nests in the mother’s womb. Metal gives birth to water, thus it is called the mother; water is born of metal, and so it is named the child. Before birth, they remain concealed within the womb.

The true person’s utmost subtlety is as if present, as if absent. Though bearing the semblance of true treasure, it has not yet taken the form of true treasure—hence it is said to be "as if present, as if absent." The great abyss of hair and beard now sinks, now floats. The great abyss is the vessel within. When water receives the qi of fire, its rising and sinking are unfixed. Advancing to spread forth, each guards its own domain. When water, fire, metal, and wood all advance together, the Four Spirits disperse and each holds to its own realm.

When gathered, it resembles white; when refined, it turns crimson. When stirred, metal appears white; once the work is complete, its color is like vermilion. Refined to serve as defense and guard, white enfolds the steadfast within. White is water; steadfast is uprightness. During refinement, water becomes the outer layer of metal. When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected, water hides within metal, uniting as one body to dwell together, jointly forming the true Dao.

Square and round, a mere inch across, they blend and support one another. Metal and water harmonize as one, square and round sharing a single inch. Born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted. Surrounded by walls and gates, it resembles Penglai’s isles. Encircling barriers seal it tight, its four paths winding and hesitant. Guarded with utmost secrecy, it bars all wickedness. Curved pavilions connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen. One may dwell without thought, yet find no respite in sorrow or toil. The hall brims with spirit and qi, none can detain it. Those who preserve it thrive; those who lose it perish.

In movement and stillness, rest and repose, it ever accompanies the practitioner. That which precedes heaven and earth is the vessel. Once heaven and earth exist, metal gives birth to water. First establish the vessel, then enter into metal and water—thus it is called "preceding." The vessel’s head emerges from the furnace’s crown, hence its exalted stature. Using earth as the furnace, shaped like walls and gates, the furnace and vessel join in the form of a mountain—thus likened to Penglai, where the true person resides within the inner furnace.

The vessel’s exterior encircles like a ring, its revolutions interconnected, resembling winding pavilions. Secure its junctions, block even the faintest breach, ensuring firmness and completeness. Value its steadfastness, grasp its subtle principles, and success comes without striving. Lose the root source, and worry is futile. In the intervals of movement and stillness, rest and activity, lies the moment of gathering and refining. Though the work depends on water and fire, its completion rests with metal and water—yet it also relies on the practitioner, not self-attainment. Thus it is said: in movement and stillness, rest and repose, it ever accompanies the person.

These are not the methods of internal alchemy; inner vision requires contemplation. This refers to the Dao of embryonic breathing, where one gazes within at the five viscera and cultivates intent. Treading the steps of the Dipper’s stars, following the six jia with the days and hours. Walking the stars, pacing the Northern Dipper, ingesting the talismans of the six jia, swallowing the qi of the sun and moon.

The yin path exhausts one and nine, muddling and disturbing the primordial womb. One is primordial qi; nine is the yang path. Engaging in chamber arts, primordial qi and the yang path become turbid and disordered, leading to ruin. Ingesting qi fills the vast intestines, exhaling the upright and inhaling the perverse. That within the body is upright; that outside is perverse. Exhaling the body’s uprightness and inhaling the perverse from without, one constantly fills the vastness of the intestines. Day and night without sleep, the intestines rumble ceaselessly. The body grows weary, the spirit dazed as if deranged. The hundred vessels seethe like a boiling cauldron, unable to settle into clarity.

Erecting walls and altars, paying reverence morning and night. Ghostly apparitions manifest in forms, stirring emotions in dreams. The heart rejoices, the mind delights, believing longevity is assured. Yet one dies before their time, their corpse left to rot and decay. Every action runs counter, perverse and losing the pivotal mechanism. These several practices—believing in ghosts and spirits, repeatedly performing sacrifices as merit, indulging in deluded thoughts—even dreams may deceive one into thinking the Dao is attained, leading to self-satisfaction. Unaware of losing the center of heaven’s mandate, one suffers premature death instead.

Those who practice such methods often dwell in mountains and forests. When their lives end, their bodies naturally rot and decay. Embryonic breathing and the like are not the true Dao. These are explained to clarify their divergence, for they belong not to the school of harmony but to the class of chaos. The *Taiqing Jing* states: The Dao of longevity lies not in sacrifices or serving ghosts and spirits, not in daoyin or stretching exercises, not in incantations or verbose speech, not in intense contemplation or self-inflicted hardship.

The Dao of longevity lies in the divine elixir. Knowing it is easy; achieving it is difficult. Only the nine-times-cycled, eight-jewel elixir suffices. All other methods mislead. If one knows the true Dao, be cautious and do not pursue them. The arts are myriad, numbering in the thousands. They advance and retreat contrary to the Yellow and the Old, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals.

The *Taiqing Jing* states: The Yellow and the Old refer to the Yellow Old Lord of the Central Palace; the Nine Capitals refer to the methods of the Nine Perfected, all of which are the natural Dao. The enlightened grasp their meaning, suddenly understanding their origin. In essence: Yellow is earth; nine is yang. Earth suppresses yang, preventing it from soaring. Among all the methods, only the *Cantong Qi* is most wondrous. Examine the sage’s intent, know the source of the matter, and the Dao will be accomplished without fail, virtue perfected without omission. Practice diligently, day and night without negligence.

Cultivate for a full year, day and night without weariness. After three years of devoted practice, one may lightly ascend and roam afar. Consuming but a single grain of rice daily, the Dao is perfected in three years. Whether one seeks to rise through emptiness is a matter of personal inclination. One may walk through fire without scorching, enter water without wetting. One may preserve or dissolve at will, abiding in perpetual joy without sorrow. When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected, one may conceal oneself and await the proper time. The Great One then summons, relocating one to the Central Isle. When merit is fulfilled and ascent achieved, one receives the register and chart in accordance with the celestial records. The spirit of the Great One oversees and protects the firing and refinement. After the elixir is compounded, one first reports to the Supreme Clarity; once the Supreme Clarity acknowledges it, one is fit to receive the chart and register—and the body, too, shall ascend.

The *Fire Record* was not composed in vain; it expounds the *Yi* to elucidate these principles. The work of the furnace and fire fundamentally follows the laws of yin and yang. Humans, as the origin of yin and yang, take their form to clarify these correspondences. The crescent moon models the crucible and cauldron; the vessel’s shape resembles a recumbent moon. The White Tiger serves as the pivot for refinement. The White Tiger is metal; first metal is added, then water, for water takes metal as its axis. Mercury is called the Flowing Pearl—a pearl of mercury, the essence of the Great Yang. The Azure Dragon accompanies it. The Azure Dragon is water; water and metal both enter the vessel. Raising the east to meet the west, soul and spirit naturally seek one another. The dragon is water, the tiger is metal; their union is like a person possessing both soul and spirit. The yin spirit is called *po*, the yang spirit *hun*; their mutual seeking is the union of yin and yang.

The upper crescent corresponds to *dui* with the number eight, the lower crescent to *gen* with eight as well. When the essences of the two crescents merge, the body of Qian and Kun is complete. Two eights make a catty, the *Yi*’s Dao stands upright without tilting. Two eights are sixteen, together forming a catty. Though this takes yin and yang as its model, it is the Dao of transformation. A *zhu* contains three hundred and eighty-four, corresponding to the reckoning of firing times and hexagram lines. Twenty-four *zhu* make an ounce; three hundred and eighty-four *zhu* align with the six lines of a hexagram, and the sixty-four hexagrams together contain three hundred and eighty-four strokes—thus harmonizing with the Dao of the *Yi*.

When metal enters the fierce fire, its color does not lose its crystalline radiance. Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never dimmed in brightness, nor has metal lost its weight; their forms remain constant. This is drawn as an analogy. Metal and wood arise with the moon’s phases; at the new moon, they receive the solar tally. As the moon receives its tally from the sun, so too does water receive its tally from metal. The metal friend returns to its mother; at the moon’s waning, the day envelops it. When the moon wanes, metal encloses water. Concealing its ramparts, it sinks into the cavernous void. Before metal and water form their ramparts, they lie submerged within the cavernous void. When metal regains its original nature, the cauldron’s majestic light rejoices. Refining metal into metal restores its essence; once metal is perfected, the cauldron celebrates its achievement.

The numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to make three; *wu* and *ji* are called five. When three and five harmonize, the eight minerals serve as the guiding principle. *Zi* is water, with the number one; *wu* is fire, with the number two; their union makes three. *Wu* and *ji* are earth, with the number five; three and five together make eight. The guiding principle of metal and water consists solely of water, fire, and earth. The *Central Scripture* states that the three substances form a single household, all converging in *wu* and *ji*—this is the meaning. The three substances refer to water, fire, and earth.

Inhalation and exhalation desire one another, suspended breath becomes husband and wife. The qi of water and fire breathe in and out within the vessel; metal and water, receiving this, unite. Metal is the male, water the female; their union embodies the Dao of husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal, the Flowing Pearl the mother of water. Water takes earth as its ghost; earth fills water, preventing it from rising. The Flowing Pearl is a name for cinnabar. Metal is born of earth, water emerges from cinnabar; earth overcomes water, hence it is called a ghost. Only earth’s power prevents water from flying away.

The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, its qi balanced to regulate victory and defeat. The Vermilion Bird, the essence of fire, is drawn at the furnace’s south. Only fire can regulate metal and water. If water prevails, fire is extinguished; both perish and return to the thick earth. Though fire may blaze intensely, it is ultimately extinguished by water. At the moment of their mutual cessation, only clods of earth remain. Once the returning elixir is complete, water and fire vanish. The three natures have converged, sharing a common origin. The three natures—metal, water, and fire—through the mutual generation of the Five Phases, become one another’s origin. Water and metal unite, encountering fire to form the elixir.

Even sesame seeds prolong life; how much more the returning elixir, which may be ingested? Metal’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things. When alchemists consume it, their lifespans are extended. This is not ordinary metal but the returning elixir. Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and establishing rules. The furnace’s four sides are coated with earth. When metal and cinnabar enter the five viscera, their mist scatters like wind and rain. The vapor reaches the four limbs, and one’s complexion becomes joyful and lustrous. White hair turns black, teeth regrow and renew. The old man reverts to youthful vigor, the aged woman becomes a maiden. Transforming one’s form, one escapes worldly calamities and is called a Perfected One.

The Yellow Sprout resembles golden cinnabar; when it enters water, its swiftness is like wind and rain. Water transforms for metal, first black then yellow. Metal is the father, water the mother—hence the terms old man and aged woman. When metal and water transmute into gold, once the treasure is complete, one naturally escapes the kiln of worldly calamities. Youthful vigor is the appearance of flourishing metal; the maiden is the name for an untouched girl.

When ceruse is cast into fire, its color corrupts and reverts to lead. Refining lead yields ceruse; refining ceruse yields lead—both return to their origin. Ice and snow, warmed by hot water, dissolve into the Great Mystery. Water congeals into ice; ice melts back into water—this too returns to its origin. Gold takes cinnabar as its essence, harmonizing with mercury. Cinnabar is another name for the Yellow Sprout; when cast into mercury, it is made complete. Transformation arises from its true nature; beginning and end follow one another. To make gold from gold is to forge the golden bell. Sowing millet yields millet; millet thus grows. If one desires to become an immortal through ingested elixirs, one must use substances of the same kind. Plant rice with rice; hatch chicks with eggs. Assisting nature with like kind, things are easily refined. Can fish eyes become pearls? Can fleabane become catalpa? The male crouches at birth; the female curls her body—such is the principle of nature, and thus the Reverted Elixir is formed. How is this different from the power of the kiln? Like kinds follow one another; discordant matters do not yield treasure. Thus, swallows do not hatch phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward. Gold and water, lead and mercury—these are of the same kind. Beyond this, matters diverge and fail. The world abounds with scholars, exalted and wondrous talents. Yet if they do not encounter the proper moment, their fine fires consume their wealth. Clinging to texts and relying on written words, they recklessly impose their own ideas. Without cause or reason, what measure or grasp can they hold?

Pound and refine quartz, chalcanthite, mica, and alum-magnetite.
Sulfur burns in camphorwood; lead and mercury are blended and wrought.
Beneath the bellows, the five-metal bronze serves as the pivot.
Dissimilar natures, unlike kinds—how could they dwell as one?
A thousand attempts bring ten thousand failures; luck never favors the reckless.
From youth to white-haired age, they seek in vain, vexed by doubt.
Turning from the Dao, they cling to deluded paths, treading crooked byways.
Peering through a tube, their vision narrows—how can they gauge what lies ahead?
This laments those in the world who, misunderstanding the Way of the Reverted Elixir, broadly seek mineral medicines, yet reach old age without success.

As for the utmost sages, none surpass Fu Xi, who drew the eight trigrams and sketched the map of Heaven and Earth.
King Wen, ancestor of emperors, expanded and refined the line statements.
Confucius, near-sage and hero, composed the *Ten Wings* to aid them.
These three were raised by Heaven, each rising in turn to govern their time.
Though their ranks differed, their steps were measured; their merits and virtues did not diverge.
Their creations followed precedent, their calculations weighed each fraction.
The tangible is easy to estimate; the formless is hard to plan.
Their works set models for emulation, establishing classics for the world.
Without innate foresight, they awakened through their teachers.
Vast as lifting the curtain, they ascended the high terrace with eyes closed.
This laments that even the Three Sage Emperors could not grasp the Way of the Reverted Elixir, blindly entering the Yellow Springs.
How much less can the dull masses, adorned in finery, deluded by the world, ever achieve it?

The *Book of Documents* says: "To know it is not hard; to practice it is hard."
The *Fire Records* span six hundred chapters, yet their essentials do not differ.
Though the texts expound with care, the common folk do not ponder deeply.
Tracing their origins, the hidden and manifest originally dwell as one.
I speak this to the worthy—how dare I utter falsehoods?
If I were to seal my tongue in silence, cutting off the Dao, I would incur guilt and punishment.
Pouring my thoughts onto bamboo and silk, I fear leaking Heaven’s tally.
Hesitant, I sigh; looking up and down, I gather my thoughts.

Refinement follows method and order; I dare not yet unfold it all.
I briefly outline its framework, revealing the branches from the root.
Fearing others may not awaken, I explain with earnest care, yet they remain benighted, unaware of the Dao’s foundation.
Though the words may seem disordered and vast, the gate ever deeper, the wise who delve into it will find no path they cannot tread.

Use gold as the embankment; when water enters, it flows freely.
First build the barrier—then water will not overflow.
What is the barrier for? First place the gold, then add the water.
When water meets gold, it flows with ease.
Gold’s tally is fifteen; water’s completed number is six, totaling fifteen.
Water’s number is six; gold’s number is nine. Six and nine together make fifteen.
Even in yin and yang, they remain obscure—not a matter of weight.
Before the furnace, fix the proportions: five parts water remain.
Ten parts make an inch; an inch makes a catty.
Thus, gold holds five parts; the rest is water.
This is the fixed measure.

When the two are made true, gold’s weight returns to its origin.
The two are gold and water. When gold and water enter the vessel, together they weigh one catty.
Upon becoming true, they do not diminish from their original measure.
The third does not enter; water and it unite.
Gold, water, and earth make three. Water and gold make two.
Gold and water enter on their own; earth remains outside.
The three substances contain and receive one another, transforming as if by spirit.
The three are gold, water, and earth. What completes and restrains gold and water is earth.
Dwelling in the center, it transforms as though divine.

Below lies the qi of Grand Yang, steaming in an instant.
Fire is called Grand Yang. First it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot.
When gold and water meet fire, they unite. Their liquid follows the qi to solidify, gradually hardening like ice, its color like gold, hence the name Yellow Chariot.
As the years and months near their end, nature is destroyed, and lifespan harmed.
Once the Reverted Elixir is complete, the natures of gold and water perish.
Their form resembles ash and earth, their appearance like dust on a bright window.
Pounded, refined, and combined, they hasten into the gate of red.
This describes the Reverted Elixir’s state as it nears transformation, like a person relinquishing worldly ties to return to the true.

Securely seal their juncture, ensuring perfection and firmness.
As the years and months draw to a close, the fire’s qi grows fierce.
If the seal is not tight, all is ruined at the brink of success.
Blazing fire spreads below, its roar ceaseless day and night.
At first, the civil is employed; in the end, the martial is arrayed.
The *Song* says: "Beginning and end are martial; the middle is civil."
First seventy days, last thirty days.
Two hundred and six, well-balanced.
The initial phase is martial for seventy days; the final phase is martial for seventy days; the last is martial for thirty days.
The middle three hundred and sixty days are civil.
Observe with utmost care, scrutinizing the balance of cold and warmth.
Cold and warmth are the civil and martial.
Revolving through the twelve nodes, each node’s end marks a new beginning.
Taking the month as the measure, observe the gold and water.
When qi wanes and life nears its end, rest and death claim soul and spirit.
At the destined hour: in winter’s three days, water reigns, wood assists, fire dies, earth is imprisoned, metal rests.
Yin is the spirit; yang is the soul—both yin and yang are abandoned.
The color shifts to purple, and the Reverted Elixir blazes forth.
"Reverted" means returning to its original hue.
Humans are born bearing the Dao’s qi; consuming it, they return to the Dao—hence the name Reverted Elixir.
A single *daogui* of powdered elixir—the Nine Cauldrons are most divine.

Once the Reverted Elixir is achieved, consume rice daily.
When on the verge of ascension, ingest a *daogui* in one dose.
Expounding the five phases, the method is concise and unburdened.
Water is used to stimulate fire, suddenly extinguishing its brilliance.
If one understands the Dao of the five phases, affairs become simple and free from human toil.
When the qi of water and fire intermingle and steam, the inherent light of metal naturally fades.
Sun and moon press upon each other, ever abiding between darkness and dawn.
When sun and moon eclipse, it is always between darkness and dawn—
the time of yin-yang union, when they mutually obscure one another.
At this moment, metal and water behave likewise.
When water flourishes, Kan encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, the lofty day darkens.
As water and fire qi interact, they alternately wax and wane.
Yin and yang devour each other—this is the natural course of their mutual resonance.
If not by nature, who would cause it?
The mutual resonance of metal and water follows the same principle.
Names are given to define essence; characters are assigned to express nature.
To call metal "metal" is an unchanging name.
"Yellow Sprout" is a character derived from its nature.
When metal returns to its original nature, it is then called Reverted Elixir.
Refining metal into metal is the completion of the Reverted Elixir.
I dare not speak falsely, but emulate the words of the sages.
I imitate the images of the *Yi*—I do not presume to establish my own doctrine.
Ancient records speak of Dragon and Tiger.
Dragon and Tiger are metal and water.
The Yellow Emperor praised the splendor of metal; Huainan refined autumn stone.
It is the powder of alum.
Wang Yang added the Yellow Sprout.
The Way of the Reverted Elixir relies solely on these two substances.
Metal and water share three names, differing in designation yet identical in origin.
The wise can uphold and practice it; the unworthy should not partake.
Do not recklessly equate silver and lead, for both belong to metal and water.
The Dao remains the same across ancient and modern times.
Though eras differ, the Dao is without duality.
In conversation, swiftly deliberate—
scholars, exert yourselves further, and ponder deeply.
The sages established teachings to clarify themselves, fearing that the customs of the age would not believe.
The essential words are revealed, shining clearly and never deceiving.
"Not deceiving me" means not deceiving others.

*Central Scroll of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*
Commentary by Immortal Changsheng of the Hidden Yin

The firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun unite in mutual embrace. Qian is yang, hence firm and upright; Kun is yin, hence soft and compliant. Soft compliance is likened to water, firm uprightness compared to metal. Firmness and softness embrace to form a pair. Yang bestows, yin receives; male and female depend on each other. Through this dependence, creation unfolds, and essence and qi expand. The union of yin and yang resembles the mutual need of male and female. At the moment of their union, essence and qi become matter—this is the merging of metal and water, receiving qi to attain perfection.

Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance descending and spreading. The profound and obscure are difficult to fathom, impossible to depict in diagrams. Kan is water, Li is fire. Fire lies below, water above, positioned at the vessel’s apex. The apex is the head. The blazing heat within the furnace is thus said to descend and spread. The profound and obscure refer to the Dao’s subtlety, beyond the reach of words—how much less can diagrams trace its source?

The sage measures and orders the primordial foundation. The sage refers to Fuxi. The primordial foundation is the root of the Dao. The sage, gazing upward and downward, discerns the root of the Dao. The four—Qian, Kun, Kan, Li—are the terms for metal, wood, water, and fire. When these four merge in chaos, they naturally generate and complete. Emptiness and nothingness serve as metaphors for the absence of intent.

The sixty-four hexagrams are employed, their expansion like a chariot’s deployment. The function of yin and yang resembles a person using a chariot, revolving and circulating endlessly. The dragon-horse is harnessed, the enlightened ruler holds the reins. When harmonious, they follow; the path is level and true. If perverse, they encounter peril and obstruction, endangering the state. The dragon is Qian; the horse is Kun. The ruler is fire; the state is the furnace-vessel. When fire’s qi is balanced, metal and water follow their course without scattering. When fire’s qi is disharmonious, metal and water overflow and drift. In their drifting, the vessel and furnace are ruined. The dragon illustrates Qian, the horse clarifies Kun.

When the noble one dwells in his chamber and speaks goodness, a thousand *li* away it resonates. This illustrates the Metal Duke abiding in the spirit-chamber. The lord of ten thousand chariots, dwelling in the nine-fold chamber, issues decrees and governs, aligning with the seasons of yin and yang. Conceal the vessel and await the time; do not transgress the hexagram’s day.

The *Xici* states: When the noble one dwells in his chamber and speaks goodness, a thousand *li* away it resonates—how much more so those nearby? If his words are not good, a thousand *li* away they are opposed—how much more so those nearby? This is a metaphor for metal.

On the days of the two solstices, yin and yang both return. The former kings on these days closed the passes, and merchants and travelers did not journey. The ruler aligns with yin and yang to open and close. Metal and wood reside within the vessel, likened to the nine-fold chamber. Issuing decrees and governing employs water and fire, following the cycles of cold and heat to nurture growth. This is observation.

Using *Zhun* and *Meng* according to the day does not transgress the hexagram’s form, aligning with the hexagram’s line texts. *Zhun* employs *shen-zi*, *Meng* uses *yin-xu*. The *Yisi Zhan* states: Those of the same kind but different positions—*yin*, *wu*, *xu* belong to fire; *shen*, *zi*, *chen* belong to water. *Shen*, *zi*, *chen* pertain to yin; *yin*, *wu*, *xu* pertain to yang. From dawn to noon is yang; from noon to dusk is yin. Thus, at the dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* governs affairs, and at dusk, *Meng* takes its turn. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days—from the last day of the lunar month to the dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* receives the tally, and the *Fu* hexagram begins to sprout, and so forth.

I briefly present these two images, yet cannot exhaust their details. When benevolence is applied, virtue is enacted; when righteousness is established, punishments are set. Those who oppose it meet misfortune; those who follow it meet fortune. The two images refer to water and fire. Water possesses benevolence and delights in bestowing; fire possesses righteousness and is replete with punishments. Following them, metal and water harmonize. Opposing them, metal and water flee.

Follow the calendar and decrees with utmost sincerity and meticulous care. Carefully observe the sun and moon, scrutinizing their waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation brings regret and shame as thieves. The *Xici* states: Good fortune, misfortune, regret, and shame arise from movement. Movement is fire. When fire’s qi moves, scrutinize its waxing and waning—without fixed direction, regret and shame arise. If the day’s hour passes even slightly, the slightest discrepancy causes metal and water to fail to congeal, giving rise to calamity.

When the two solstices alter their measures, discord and convolution arise. In the depths of winter, scorching heat; in the height of summer, frost and snow. At the two equinoxes, disorder reigns, not corresponding to the clepsydra’s mark. Wind and rain lack moderation; drought and flood contend. Locusts surge and seethe; the heavens display their omens. Mountains collapse, the earth crumbles; strange grasses sprout from the sides.

The *Yisi Zhan* states: On the days of the two solstices and two equinoxes, yin and yang divide and reach their extremes. The day preceding these is *li*; from this position, all reach the months of the four centers. The eighth and second months are the positions where yin and yang divide. The fifth and eleventh months are where yin and yang both reach. In the second month, yang qi begins to emerge, yin qi begins to enter—this is yin *li*. In the eighth month, yin qi begins to emerge, yang qi begins to enter—this is yang *li*. Yang is born at *zi*, yin is born at *wu*. In the fifth month, yin qi begins to arrive, yang qi begins to recede—hence the division and arrival. The day preceding these is *li*, meaning yin and yang divide at this time.

The aforementioned matters all refer to the consequences when yin and yang are unbalanced. If water and fire are not moderated, metal and water likewise undergo such transformations.

The filial son’s devotion moves the august pole. Nearby, it arises from the mouth; afar, it flows to distant lands. The filial son is water.

The August Pole is metal. This is water moving in response to metal, flowing and turning without cease, reaching distant lands and dwelling in other regions. It may summon misfortune or bring fortune; it may usher in great peace or provoke warfare. Among these four outcomes, all depend upon the heart’s intent.

The four refer to *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li*—that is, armor, helmets, weapons, and spears. When yin and yang are unbalanced, misfortune arises; when yin and yang are harmonized, fortune comes. When fortune comes, great peace naturally follows. Between these two, all hinges upon fire. Fire’s fierce power resembles weapons and spears.

In movement and stillness, one follows the unchanging rule. Fire moves, water is still—thus they accord with yin and yang, unwavering as the carpenter’s line. The four seasons proceed in due order, aligning with the qi. The qi of water and fire follow the four seasons. Hard and soft are decisively divided, never encroaching upon one another. By day, yang is hard; by night, yin is soft. Day and night are distinct, neither overpowering the other. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The spirits of the five directions each guard their own domain, protecting metal and water to prevent excess or deficiency.

The *Yi* flows in circulation, bending and extending in alternation. The Way of change circulates and moves: yin bends and yang extends, yang bends and yin extends, their positions reversing in endless cycles. Between the dark and new moons, they join in accord and move within. At the time between dark and new moons, the sun and moon conjoin. Having received the tally, they once more traverse metal and water. At this time, they also unite and mate; when complete, they return to wander within the vessel.

The tally refers to the active tally: at dawn and the new moon, *Zhen* serves as the active tally and *Tun* as the active affair; at dusk and the dark moon, *Xun* serves as the active tally and *Meng* as the active affair. In turbid obscurity, the female and male follow one another. Their essences moisten and nourish, spreading transformation and flow. The numinous spirits of heaven and earth cannot be measured. Turbid obscurity describes the appearance of chaos. Water is the female, metal the male. When metal and water unite, they follow one another without deviation, thus able to moisten the flesh and spread transformation—how could this differ from the divine?

Their utility lies in securing the self, concealing form and hiding away. The *Wenyan* of *Qian* states: "Utility is the harmony of rightness." When things are harmonized, the self is naturally at peace. This refers to the utility of metal and water, concealed within the vessel.

It begins in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Turning rightward, it spews forth its wheel and spits out its sprouts. The sun and moon turn right, the five planets revolve left, arising from the Dipper and converging at *wu*. At this time, the moon spews forth its wheel, things spit out their sprouts, metal emits its fluid, and water disgorges its light. Hidden depths reveal images, scattering radiant essence. The hidden depths refer to water; the radiant essence refers to metal. When metal flourishes, it emits brilliance; when water is clear, it reveals images.

Above *Bi* and *Mao*, *Zhen* emerges as proof. *Bi* and *Mao* are western constellations. On the third day of the lunar month, the moon’s luminous essence is born and appears above *Bi* and *Mao*. When fire arises for three days, its qi reaches the vessel’s center. Water, receiving the fire’s qi, trembles—thus the moon serves as verification.

Yang qi initiates its beginning: the first nine is the hidden dragon. Yang is established in threes, yin communicates in eights. Thus, on the third day, *Zhen* moves; on the eighth day, *Dui* proceeds. Nine is the utmost number of yang; the dragon can transform, hence it serves as a metaphor for *Qian*.

In the second month, mid-spring, branches and leaves take form. In the eighth month, mid-autumn, roots and kernels begin to form. Fire moves water on the third day, and metal proceeds on the eighth. Metal resembles the sun, moving slowly; water resembles the moon, moving swiftly. Three threes correspond, eight eights communicate—this refers to yin and yang’s mutual response, their interdependence in forming things. "The hidden dragon does not act" precisely corresponds to the month of *jianzi*, when metal and water first enter—thus the metaphor of the hidden dragon.

The second nine: the dragon appears, peaceful and luminous. When the virtues of three and five are complete, the body of *Qian* is formed. The *Wenyan* of *Qian* states: "The second nine: the dragon appears in the field—this is the virtue of a ruler." Virtue is vast and transformative. Three and five make fifteen, the time of the full moon when the metal body gradually takes shape—this corresponds to the second nine.

The third nine: vigilant at dusk, the divine tally wanes and breaks. Prosperity and decline gradually shift, ultimately returning to their beginning. *Xun* continues its lineage, firmly holding to its measure. *Xun* is the eldest daughter—water. *Dui* above and *Li* below form *Ge*. Water and fire contend, giving rise to change. The *Yi* states: "The third nine: the noble one is steadfast all day, vigilant at dusk as if facing danger—there is no blame." The third nine is not the virtue of the dragon, hence the metaphor of the noble one. At the time of the third nine, yang qi is abundant, but abundance inevitably declines—yin and yang have their endings and beginnings. When yang qi is abundant, yin qi wanes; yin and yang contend, thus transformation occurs.

Fire is below the vessel, water above; the eldest daughter dwells in the center. Outside, the qi of water and fire intermingle; within, metal and water transform themselves. This is the ceaseless vigilance of *Qian*, after which change arises.

The fourth nine: perhaps leaping, advancing and retreating on a perilous path. *Gen* governs advance and halt, unable to seize the moment. On the twenty-third day, one guards the crescent phase. The *Wenyan* of *Qian* asks: "The fourth nine: perhaps leaping in the abyss—why is there no blame?" The Master said: "Advancing and retreating without constancy is not straying from the path." The *Xiang* of *Gen* states: "*Gen* is halt. When it is time to halt, halt; when it is time to move, move—movement and stillness do not lose their timing. *Gen* halts—it halts where it should." At the time of the fourth nine, when metal and water seethe within the vessel, sometimes advancing, sometimes retreating, they do not leave their place, following the proper time.

At the twenty-third day, it coincides with the waning crescent phase. The fifth nine: the soaring dragon, the celestial position brings joy. The fifth nine, "the soaring dragon in the heavens," is the position of the lord and king. When the lord occupies his rightful place, how could there be no joy? At the time of pure yang, metal governs as the principal agent.

The sixth five of *Kun* reaches its utmost, binding the end and the beginning. It nurtures and fosters the many offspring, serving as the eternal mother of its kind. The *Xiang* of *Kun* states: "The sixth five: the yellow skirt, supremely auspicious." Wang Fusi says: "Yellow is the color of the sash; the skirt is the adornment of the lower body. To wear the yellow skirt and attain supreme auspiciousness is not through martial force." At the height of yin’s abundance, it does not suspect yang, for its cultured virtue resides within—this is the perfection of beauty.

The sixth five of the *Kun* hexagram occurs during the time of pure yang, when yin reaches its extreme and yang arises, succeeding one another in transformation. *Kun* is the mother of the myriad things, thus she nourishes her many children. Yin is the end, yang the beginning. At this time, water also reaches its fullness, succeeding metal. The reckoning of yang has run its course; the end returns to the beginning.

Following nature and aligning with inherent character, they turn and interact. Yang is born at *zi* and ends at *si*. Yin is born at *wu* and ends at *hai*. When yang is born, yin returns; when yin is born, yang returns. Though this is their natural disposition, it is as if they abdicate in succession.

The ninth above: the exalted dragon wages virtue in the wilds. *Kang* means "utmost." When yang reaches its extreme, yin arises, hence the struggle in the wilds. The Dao of metal and water is no different in this regard.

"Using the nine" in graceful motion becomes the compass and square of the Way. Nine represents yang. Yang is a thing of firmness and uprightness, and only the body of *Qian* employs it. *Qian* metal is yang fire. Metal can employ fire, thereby perfecting its true nature. Following the revolving jade armillary, ascending and descending, rising and falling.

The revolving jade is the Northern Dipper. The Northern Dipper turns left, while the sun and moon spiral right. The spiral governs metal, the jade armillary governs water. Ascending and descending in cyclical return—there is no constancy. The six lines of the hexagram revolve in intricate patterns, difficult to perceive clearly, hence there is no fixed position, making them the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*. This refers to the six lines of *Qian* and *Kun* in ceaseless transformation, cycling without fixed position. *Qian* and *Kun* are established, and from them arises change. Thus they are called its ancestral foundation.

At the new moon’s dawn, it is *Fu* ("Return"), when yang qi first flows through. Entering and exiting without hindrance, it erects the standard of firmness. When the Yellow Bell aligns with *zi*, signs of flourishing abundance appear. It scatters the tender shoots, and the black-haired people attain constancy.

On the first day of the eleventh month, yang qi begins its return. *Fu* ("Return") means "entering." Yang qi first emerges—"emerging" means "issuing forth." Each follows its natural course, all free from illness. On the Winter Solstice, the pitch aligns with the Yellow Bell, and yang qi first arises at *zi*. The myriad things stir, tender sprouts gradually flourish, and the black-haired people advance in propagation.

This is called Heaven’s distribution of yang qi, the multitude’s progression in the constant Dao. The constant Dao is the fire Dao. At this time, Metal and Water first return within the vessel, both receiving yin and yang, likewise free from illness. *Lin* ("Approach") stokes the furnace with kindling, opening the clouds to reveal the true light. The radiance steadily advances, and the days grow ever longer.

The *Tuan* commentary on *Jin* ("Progress") states: *Jin* means "to advance." Light emerges above the earth, following and adhering to Heaven. The *Tuan* commentary on *Yi* ("Increase") states: Heaven bestows, Earth produces—its increase knows no bounds. The way of gradual increase advances in step with the seasons. Light is yang fire; "above the earth" is the furnace. The "lower fire" is the vessel. This speaks of fire advancing beneath the furnace and attaching to the vessel. Metal corresponds to Heaven, Water to Earth. Metal and Water bestow life, naturally harmonizing.

At *chou*, the Great Tube aligns, structuring the proper balance of ascent and descent. In the month when *chou* is established, the pitch aligns with the Great Tube. *Lü* ("Tube") means "to extend." This is the time when yang qi and fire extend, and Metal and Water attain their proper equilibrium. "Ascent and descent" describes the ceaseless alternation of high and low. Looking upward, it receives *Tai* ("Peace"), where firm and yielding flourish together. Yin and yang intersect, the small departs and the great arrives.

The *Zhong* commentary on *Tai* states: *Tai*—the small departs, the great arrives—auspicious and smooth. Thus Heaven and Earth unite, and the myriad things communicate; above and below unite, and their aspirations align. "Firm and yielding" are Metal and Water. "Yin and yang" are Water and Fire. Metal and Water transform, and Water and Fire communicate; Water and Fire communicate, and their aspirations align. This is modeled on the sixty-four hexagrams.

The spokes converge at *yin*, their motion shifting in accord with the season. In the month when *yin* is established, yang qi greatly extends. At this juncture, Metal and Water converge like spokes and revolve, following the time. Gradually passing through *Dazhuang* ("Great Strength"), they flank the gate of *mao*.

The *Tuan* commentary on *Dazhuang* states: Firmness moves—thus it is called *Dazhuang*. Firmness is Metal. This is when Metal first liquefies, gradually reaching *Dazhuang*. *Zhuang* ("Strength") describes the appearance of solid ice. Elm pods fall away, returning to their root.

At the advent of *Lichun* ("Spring Begins"), Wood reigns supreme. *Jia* (the first celestial stem) summons *Yi* (the second), and *Yi* harbors the qi of Metal, returning to respond to *Jia*—thus in mid-spring, the elm pods are shed. The pods, white in hue, bear the color of Metal. As the elm pods return to their root, Metal reverts to its origin. Punishment and virtue contend, and day and night begin their division.

The *Dunjing* states: "The Dao of Heaven and Earth deems yin as punishment and yang as virtue. When yang emerges, the myriad things endure punishment; when it withdraws, the myriad things preserve virtue." Thus it is said: Punishment and virtue converge, gathering together at the gate. Heaven and Earth part ways, never to reunite. In the second and eighth months, yin and yang occupy their respective positions. In the second month, yang qi first emerges while yin qi begins its retreat—this is yin’s departure. In the eighth month, yin qi first emerges while yang qi begins its retreat—this is yang’s departure. Metal and Water, Water and Fire, likewise follow this pattern.

In the hexagram *Guai* ("Parting"), yin retreats while yang ascends and takes the lead. It washes and preens its wings, shaking off the dust of slumber. The *Tuan* commentary on *Guai* states: "*Guai* means to part. The firm parts from the yielding. The yielding rides atop five firm lines." The firm is Metal; the yielding, Water. As Metal transforms into Water, it seeks to reach a state beyond punishment. With five firm lines and one yielding, parting presents no difficulty.

In *Qian* ("The Creative"), vigor flourishes and radiance spreads to the four neighbors. *Qian* embodies strength. Yang qi, firm and vigorous, thrives in the fourth month, thus its influence extends broadly to the four quarters. At this time, Metal is likewise. Yang concludes at *si* (the sixth earthly branch), where the two forces contend in the center. Yang begins at *zi* and ends at *si*; yin begins at *wu* and ends at *hai*. Within a year, yin and yang each occupy half. "Contending" refers to yin’s encroachment upon yang. Yin clings to yang, hence their battle in the wild—this is the meaning of "contending." Metal and Water likewise contend in due season.

In *Gou* ("Coming to Meet"), the first threads emerge, treading frost at the forefront. The *Tuan* commentary on *Gou* states: "*Gou* means encounter. Heaven and Earth meet, and the myriad things all flourish." The *Tuan* commentary on *Kun* states: "Treading frost, solid ice—yin first congeals. Following its Dao, it leads to solid ice." The encounter of Heaven and Earth is the intimacy of Metal and Water. Treading frost and solid ice depict the transformations of Metal and Water. The *Cantong Qi* draws its imagery with profound depth—only through deep inquiry can one fathom it.

In *Jing* ("The Well"), the cold spring lies at the bottom, with *wu* (the seventh earthly branch) governing *Ruibin* (the sixth musical note). The guest submits to yin, for yin is the host. The *Xiang* commentary on *Jing* states: "The city changes, but the well does not—this is due to firmness at the center." With firmness residing at the center, it can establish its place. The vessel symbolizes Metal, illustrating firmness. Firmness within the vessel does not depart from its position. On the summer solstice, the pitch aligns with *Ruibin*—this is yang. Yet the guest submits to yin: in the month of *jianwu* (the fifth month), yin is born while yang reverts to yin, making yin the host. At this time, Metal is in ascendancy, but when Metal returns to Water, Water becomes the host.

In *Dun* ("Retreat"), it departs from its position, gathering its essence. It harbors virtue and awaits its time, its handle concealed in darkness. The meaning of *Dun* lies in yang’s adherence to yin. The Dao of yin seeks to gradually grow, while the true Dao has not yet wholly vanished. After the summer solstice, yin waxes as yang wanes, making yin the host and yang its adherent. This is Metal clinging to Water. As the Dao of Water swells, yang withdraws its essence, awaiting the moment to act. The month of *jianzi* (the eleventh month) is that moment. "Concealed handle" resembles the hidden dragon, unfit for use—its body retreats into obscurity.

In *Pi* ("Stagnation"), closure bars the name of yang. The *Tuan* commentary on *Pi* states: "Great goes, small comes—yet the myriad things do not communicate. Heaven and Earth do not interact, and Water does not merge." Once yin qi has extended, in the twelfth month it unites to achieve perfection.

In *Guan* ("Contemplation"), one examines its measures and observes the conditions of mid-autumn. The fourth star of the Northern Dipper is *quan* ("authority"). Authority signifies punishment. In mid-autumn, yin flourishes, corresponding to this. At this time, it congeals and solidifies. It nurtures the tender and young, while the old and withered regain their vitality. The tender and young represent the *chanyu* (the "young maiden"); the old and withered, the *qiyu* (the "aged woman"). When the *qiyu* attains perfection as a true person, vitality and decay naturally cease.

Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, emerging beneath the cover of growth. *Mao* (the fourth earthly branch) signifies "cover," for as things grow, they spread across the earth, using it as their covering. In the month of *jianyou* (the eighth month), when the myriad things perish, shepherd’s purse and wheat are born—this corresponds to the position of the third line, "containing elegance and holding to uprightness." In the yin months, yang qi steals forth to grow. When Water is abundant, Metal likewise steals its transformation within Water.

In *Bo* ("Splitting Apart"), the limbs rot and the form dissolves. The *Tuan* commentary states: "*Bo* means the yielding splits the firm and transforms it." This refers to yang qi being wholly stripped of its form. At this time, the body of Metal scatters completely, and Water can transform Metal—this is the image of *Bo*. When the transforming qi is exhausted, the divine is lost. This speaks of yang qi’s transformation, which is spent by the eighth month. The unfathomable is called the divine. With yang qi in decline, the divine is about to vanish. When the Dao reaches its limit, it turns back, returning to the origin of *Kun*. With the Dao of yang concealed, it reverts to the growth of *Kun*. As the virtue of Metal wanes, Water takes precedence.

The constancy of Earth’s principles bears Heaven’s proclamation. Earth is yin; Heaven, yang. Yang proclaims while yin closes. Yet yin is not eternally closed—it must await yang to begin its growth. Though yang nurtures, it also relies on yin to complete things. The profound and distant mystery is separated yet connected. Heaven is dark; Earth, yellow—they are vastly distant, veiled by clouds and mist, beyond intimacy. Yet when the sun and moon shine brightly, mountains and marshes exchange qi, thunder and wind respond in unison, and cold and heat circulate—then they follow one another in an endless cycle. How much easier, then, for Metal and Water, so near, to stir one another without difficulty.

Responding to measures to nurture the seeds—this is the source of yin and yang. All that nourishes the myriad beings accords with these measures. The source from which these measures arise is none other than the root of yin and yang, the foundation of returning cinnabar.

Vast and indistinct, its beginnings are unknowable. Within the vastness, amid the indistinct, yin and yang operate in concealment, their origins beyond tracing. The vastness refers to the furnace; the indistinct, to the vessel. Metal and Water circulate within it in endless flow.

At first, one strays from the path and loses the way; later, one becomes the sovereign ruler. As the *Tuan* of *Kun* states: "First one strays and loses the Dao; later, one follows and attains constancy." In the southwest, one finds companions and proceeds with one’s kind—this refers to yin. The *Wenyan* says: "*Kun* is utterly yielding, yet in movement it becomes firm and square. Later, it attains the sovereign and achieves constancy." Water, yielding and moving, gradually hardens into solid ice—this is its firmness. Metal is Water; when Water attains Metal, it attains the enduring Dao.

Nothing is level without incline—this is the natural course of the Dao. The *Tai* hexagram states: "Nine in the third place: Nothing is level without incline; nothing goes forth without return." Nine in the third place is the extreme position of yang; when yang reaches its limit, it inclines. "Incline" describes the appearance of vast openness. This is the natural course of the Dao. "Return" means reverting to the root. When yin and yang are in free communication, all is vast and unobstructed, free from affliction—this is the principle of spontaneity, not something achieved by effort. The time when Metal and Water interpenetrate is no different.

Transformation and alternation between flourishing and decline—waning and waxing follow one another. As yin and yang transform, they alternate between flourishing and decline; the origins of their waxing and waning all depend on one another. Yang nurtures and yin completes; yin destroys and yang arises. The Dao of Metal and Water, interdependent, grows ever more profound.

The end of *Kun* and the beginning of *Fu*—like following a linked ring. *Qian* is yang, and yang gives birth to the myriad things, hence it is called the beginning. *Kun* is yin, and yin completes the myriad things, hence it is called the end. When yang arises, yin returns; when yin arises, yang returns—yin and yang give birth and return without end, like a ring without seam. Metal and Water, Water and Fire, revolve in this manner.

The emperor’s eternal reign, enduring for a thousand autumns. "Nine in the fifth place: The flying dragon is in heaven"—this is the position of the emperor, who rides the six dragons to govern Heaven. *Fu* embodies the meaning of eternal governance. "Enduring" describes the appearance of imperishability: the Dao of *Qian* ceaselessly endures for a thousand autumns, and the image of *Qian* as Metal remains everlasting.

If one wishes to cultivate one’s nature and prolong life to delay the appointed time, one must carefully consider the beginning and end and reflect upon what comes first.

The body one receives is fundamentally formless and void. If one wishes to prolong life and nature, awaken to the Dao, and return to the true, one must necessarily reflect upon whence this body was received. Once the source of one’s endowment is known, the Dao may be cultivated. If one is negligent in this, all efforts will be in vain—just as in the Way of Returning the Elixir, one must first recognize its origin. Without understanding its beginnings, one’s devotion to the fire is futile.

Primordial essence spreads like clouds, borne by qi to take form. Primordial essence is primordial qi. Primordial qi arises from yin and yang. Yin and yang, as essence, give birth to the ten thousand things; humans are but one thing amid Heaven and Earth. Possessing the body of Metal and Water, they employ Water and Fire to refine the Returning Elixir. Yin and yang serve as the measure, the dwelling of hun and po. The yin spirit is the lunar po; the yang spirit is the solar hun. Hun and po mutually serve as each other’s abode. This abode is the crucible and vessel. If yin and yang still pair and unite, how much more should Metal and Water, which cannot do without each other? (As the *Upper Scripture* says: "Raise the East to join the West, and hun and po naturally seek one another.")

Nature presides within, establishing the banks and bounds. Zhuge Wuhou said: "Nature is life. Nature can commune with life." This refers to Metal and Water dwelling within the vessel, where they congeal into form, becoming the banks and bounds. *Yin’e* describes the appearance of solid ice. Emotion governs without, constructing the walls and outer ramparts. Only when the city walls are complete do the people come into being. Emotion is the master of intent. This speaks of the vessel residing within the furnace, like a city’s walls; the people refer to Metal and Water. If the furnace is firm and sealed, Metal and Water transform and generate. If the furnace and vessel are not firm, Metal and Water escape and flee—like people without city walls, having nowhere to take refuge.

At this time, all depends upon Qian and Kun. Qian is Metal; Kun is Water.

The function of the Returned Elixir lies solely in Qian and Kun, yet it does not arise of itself—it is brought about by human emotion.

*The Qian* hexagram moves directly, its essence spreading and flowing. As the *Xici* states: "Qian, in stillness, is concentrated; in movement, it is direct. Thus does it generate greatness." Qian is Metal, and Metal can flow, dispersing its essence and fluids.

*The Kun* hexagram, in stillness, contracts; in movement, it opens, serving as the dwelling of the Dao. As the *Xici* says: "Kun, in stillness, is receptive; in movement, it opens. Thus does it generate vastness." Kun is Water, and Water resides above Metal, hence it is called the containing abode.

The firm advances and then retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. The firm is yang; the yielding is yin. When yang reaches its extreme, it naturally retreats; when yin arises, it naturally flourishes. Yin and yang cycle endlessly—who causes this? Thus, when Metal enters Water, it transforms into the True.

Nine returns, seven reversals, eight reverts, six resides. One, three, five, seven, nine are the numbers of yang. Two, four, six, eight, ten are the numbers of yin. Together they sum to fifty-five, which is the number of Heaven and Earth.

Nine corresponds to the position of the exalted dragon in the *Qian* hexagram; seven corresponds to "the flying dragon in the sky." "The flying dragon in the sky" signifies the work of the great person. "The dragon at the end has regrets" indicates the calamity of exhaustion. Thus, from the ninth position, it returns to the sixth.

Eight corresponds to "dragons battling in the wild" in the *Kun* hexagram; six corresponds to "yellow skirts, supremely auspicious," with the pattern at the center. Thus, from the eighth position, it resides in the sixth.

Seize the moment when Heaven’s function is in use and decline is at its extreme. The proper function refers to the harmony of Metal and Water. The extreme of decline refers to the exhaustion of the Water-Fire path.

The man is white, the woman is red—Metal and Fire restrain each other. When restraint occurs, Water settles, and Water is the first of the Five Phases. Metal is the man, its color white. Li is the woman, its color red. When Metal receives the qi of Fire, it retains Water and does not escape. Water is numbered one, the first of the Five Phases. Is not the transformation of the Returned Elixir found in Water?

The highest good is like Water, clear and without blemish. As *Laozi* says: "The highest good is like Water." Water is clear and pure, pure and without flaw. This is the source of the supreme Dao. The same applies to the Returned Elixir.

The form and image of the Dao—its truth is difficult to depict. The supreme Dao is formless, beyond the reach of paintings or diagrams. How could the Way of the Returned Elixir be known by the common and vulgar?

When it first transforms, each step divides and resides separately. At the initial transformation of Metal and Water, each dwells in its own place. It resembles a chicken’s egg, with white and black supporting each other. Metal is white, Water is black; when they meet in the vessel, before transformation, they resemble an egg.

Though it exists in all directions, its form is in the beginning. The body of Metal is extremely heavy—one inch in all directions weighs one catty. When Metal and Water enter, each has eight taels. Upon becoming the True, it does not diminish from the beginning.

The four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones, are all complete. As the months and years draw to a close, ice congeals and solidifies. Within the four limbs, within the body, all transforms into Metal, not a hair’s breadth lost.

After ten months have passed, it emerges from its womb. From the eleventh month to the tenth month, the work of a year is complete. When the year ends, the Returned Elixir is formed, emerging from the vessel like an infant from the womb.

Its bones are weak and can be bent; its flesh is smooth as lead. Once the Returned Elixir is complete, it is beautiful and supple, so fine and smooth that it is softer than lead.

With a yang-burning mirror, fire is not kindled without the sun. When a fire mirror is turned toward the sun and mugwort is placed upon it, in an instant, fire is born.

Without the stars and moon, how can the *fangzhu* obtain water? When a water mirror is placed beneath the moon and an *huai* vessel is set to receive it, in a moment, the bowl is full.

Though the two qi are distant, through transformation and resonance, they communicate. The two qi refer to the sun and moon in the sky and Water and Fire on Earth, separated by thirty-odd myriad miles. Yet in the space of a foot or inch, their resonance is clear—yin and yang communicate, neither distance nor proximity can separate them.

How much more so when near, when it lies close within the heart and breast? As the *Xici* says: "Take it from near, from the body; take it from far, from things." Taking it near refers to the Way of Metal and Water. Taking it far refers to the essence of the sun and moon. Though yin and yang emerge from the subtle, they do not escape human intention.

Yin and yang pair with the sun and moon; Water and Fire serve as evidence. Accumulated yang’s refined essence is Fire, and Fire’s essence is the sun. Accumulated yin’s refined essence is Water, and Water’s essence is the moon. If one does not believe in the resonance of yin and yang, from where do Water and Fire arise?

The Way of the Returned Elixir fundamentally arises from yin and yang. With such proof, how could the Returned Elixir lack divine verification?

The treasure of one’s ears and eyes must be firmly sealed and not displayed. As the *Shuogua* says: "Kan is the ear; Li is the eye." This speaks of Water and Fire as the ears and eyes of Metal and Water. Seal the ears and eyes, and do not recklessly display them.

The True Person abides in the deep abyss, floating and swimming while guarding the rule. The True Person refers to the true treasure. The true treasure is the Returned Elixir. The Returned Elixir refers to Metal and Water. Metal and Water swim in the deep spring, guarding their pattern. The deep spring refers to the vessel.

Turning and curving to observe, opening and closing are all in harmony. Within the vessel in the furnace, as it turns and circles, it does not depart from Metal and Water, Water and Fire—all harmonizing their essence.

It is the axle and linchpin of oneself, in movement and stillness never exhausted. It is the hub and axle of Metal and Water, with Water and Fire as the foremost. Fire blazes and moves; Water is clear and still. The two qi resonate and transform, never exhausted, never ceasing—this is the Metal and Water of oneself.

The Li qi inwardly nourishes and protects, while the Kan does not employ hearing. The Dui union does not engage in speech, and rare words follow in great harmony.

Li is the eye, Kan is the ear, Dui is the mouth. The fire qi nourishes and protects within, while the water form settles and stills without—thus the three are sealed in the center. Once sealed, speech naturally ceases. The ear, already silent, naturally hears nothing. Following the great swan, one awaits its song. This means that once fire stirs and moves, water assists in ascending together, yet if their union is not firm, there is fear of escape.

When the three are thus secured, the body relaxes within the empty chamber. The three are water, fire, and the vessel. With their mechanisms locked, no key can open them—thus Metal and Water ease their forms. Dwelling in this empty chamber refers to the vessel’s interior.

Entrusting the will to emptiness and non-being, taking no-thought as the constant. Metal and Water within the vessel remain quiescent, doing nothing, merging with emptiness and non-being, with no-thought as the norm. No-thought and emptiness are the eternal Dao.

The proof is difficult to shift; the heart remains focused, neither straying nor wandering. This means Metal and Water, following the qi of Water and Fire, shift within the vessel, dwelling single-mindedly without further dispersion. Dispersion refers to escape.

In sleep, the spirit embraces itself; upon waking, one awaits the presence or absence. The practitioner of the Dao, guarding oneness without杂念, finds that even in dreams, the spirit of the Hu barbarians arrives. The spirit refers to the Great One. Presence and absence refer to Water and Fire.

The complexion gradually moistens, and the bones and joints grow ever stronger. Metal, receiving Water, gains a moistened complexion; Water, receiving Metal, gains a firm body. This is not only the resonance of yin and yang but also the function of Water and Fire.

Expelling the host of yin evils, one then establishes the true yang. The host of yin refers to the two Waters; the true yang refers to the one Metal. When Water transforms into Metal, the evil qi naturally dissipates.

Cultivating without respite, the steaming qi moves like clouds and rain. Clouds drift and rain falls—this is the Qian Dao’s transformation. Through transformation, Metal and Water revert to Qian.

Gently flowing like spring rain, trickling like melting ice. This describes Metal and Water receiving the qi of Water and Fire, their fluids flowing like ice dissolving.

From the head flowing down to the feet, ultimately ascending again. This means Metal and Water harmonize and ascend to become the True Person. The True Person refers to the true treasure; the true treasure is the Returned Elixir.

Coming and going through the boundless, seething within the vessel. *Fufu* describes the appearance of stillness. This means Metal and Water, receiving the qi of Water and Fire, come and go in seething stillness within the vessel.

Reversion is the proof of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. Yin and yang returning to their root is the proof of the Dao. Returning to the root means returning to the vessel. The vessel is the body of the Great Dao. Weakness refers to Water. Water possesses the virtue of will and can complete Metal.

Weeding and hoeing the long-standing filth, the subtle is harmonized and smooth. The subtle refers to Metal; the filth refers to Water. When Water is purged and transformed into Metal, even the subtle is harmonized and smooth.

The path of the turbid becoming clear, long obscured, then bright and luminous. Turbidity and obscurity refer to Water; clarity and brightness refer to Metal. Once the Metal body is formed, the Water nature naturally vanishes.

Worldly people favor minor arts, not discerning the depth of the Dao. Minor arts refer to swallowing the essence of the sun and moon, bedroom practices, guiding and pulling qi, upright thought and visualization—all accumulate toil and labor yet yield no benefit. How could they know the great Returned Elixir’s Dao, wondrous and boundless?

Abandoning the proper to follow bypaths, desiring speed, the gate remains blocked. *Ban* means obstruction. The proper refers to the great Return. Speed refers to minor practices. The Returned Elixir is slow yet effective; minor practices are quick yet ineffectual. Who knows that obstructing one’s efforts and returning to the proper Dao is the way?

The blind do not lean on staffs; the deaf listen to palace music. Those who favor minor practices are like the blind not using staffs or the deaf hearing music yet discerning nothing.

Tossing into water to catch pheasants and hares, climbing mountains to seek fish and dragons. Pheasants and hares dwell in the mountains; fish and dragons reside in water. Seeking them in the wrong place, how can they be obtained? It is like the Returned Elixir—without proper union, there is no attainment.

Planting wheat to harvest millet, using a compass to seek a square. This illustrates that the Returned Elixir cannot be attained without proper union.

Expending effort and straining the spirit, year after year without success. Though one exhausts wisdom and strength, toiling the spirit, not knowing the origin of Metal and Water, one merely wastes years of effort.

To know the method of ingesting the elixir, the affair is simple and not burdensome. The Dao of the Returned Elixir relies solely on the functions of Metal, Water, Water, and Fire—simple and not burdensome. Though daily and monthly efforts are many, the cost is minimal.

The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to leave man. Only when obtaining the Metal Flower does it turn and follow. The flowing pearl is mercury. Mercury arises from cinnabar. Cinnabar is the essence of the Great Yang, another name for mercury, which flees when exposed to fire—hence it ever seeks to leave man. When refining and combining, without the Metal Flower, Water cannot be retained. When the Metal Flower and Water are conjoined, Water is held by Metal, thus they follow one another in endless succession without loss.

The fire qi dissolves Metal, transforming it into liquid. Metal and Water unite, gradually solidifying like firm ice. The Metal Flower first sings; within the span of a meal, it dissolves and transforms into water, resembling horse’s teeth and coral. The Metal Flower, receiving fire, first transforms into water. When Water and Metal conjoin, they resemble the shape of horse’s teeth.

Yang then goes to harmonize, their natures and dispositions natural. Pressing and hastening the time of yin, confining and restraining the gate. Yang refers to Metal; yin refers to Water. Metal harmonizes with Water, their natures naturally endowed.

Confine them within the vessel—this is the work of man.
The compassionate mother nurtures and raises; the filial son repays kindness.
Thus they interlock and swallow one another, chewing and devouring in turn.
Metal is born of Water, hence called the compassionate mother.
Water returns to become Metal, hence the daily repayment of kindness.
Chewing and devouring—such is the appearance of Metal and Water uniting.

The stern father enforces governance, instructing and guiding descendants.
Earth gives birth to Metal; Metal gives birth to Water.
Earth is the father and grandfather of Metal.
Ensuring Metal and Water do not flow apart is the sole achievement of Earth.
The Five Phases reign in错序, each relying on the other to thrive.
The nature of Fire dissolves Metal; Metal subdues the flourishing of Wood.
In spring, Wood reigns; in summer, Fire reigns; in autumn, Metal reigns; in winter, Water reigns.
In the Way of Returning Elixir, Metal reigns in spring and summer; Water reigns in autumn and winter.
Yet Fire also reigns—this is the错序 of the Five Phases.
Though Earth gives birth to Metal, it is constrained by Metal.
When Metal is dissolved by yang, entering into Water is the correct path—how could it not flourish?

The Three, Five, and One are the purest essences of Heaven and Earth.
Water is numbered One; Fire, Two—One and Two make Three.
Earth is numbered Five.
The One is the Water within the vessel—this is the Three, Five, and One.
The Way of Returning Elixir relies solely on these four kinds.
When the four kinds unite, they harmonize and become the true treasure.
The purest essence is the essential qi of yin and yang.
It may be transmitted orally, but is difficult to convey in writing.
Writing cannot exhaust speech; speech cannot exhaust meaning.
The subtlety of the Dao—how could writing ever convey it?

You should turn to the right at *zi*; *wu* comes, rotating eastward.
*Zi* is yin, turning right.
*Wu* is yang, rotating left.
Yang as Metal and yin as Water both flow and turn when receiving Fire.
*Mao* and *you* serve as boundaries, establishing the two names.
The sun rises at *mao*; the moon is born at *you*—
this illustrates Metal.
Metal and Water complete one another, hence they are called Metal-Water.

The Dragon calls to the Tiger; the Tiger inhales its essence.
The two consume each other, each coveting the other’s flourishing.
The Azure Dragon is Water; the White Tiger is Metal.
Metal and Water intertwine and feed, sweet to the mouth.
When *Yinghuo* guards the west, *Taibai* traverses the heavens.
Where the killing qi arrives, what could remain standing?
*Yinghuo* is Fire; *Taibai* is Metal.
When Metal receives the qi of Fire, it flows and turns within the vessel—hence it is said to traverse the heavens.
Killing qi refers to *Yinghuo*.

Like the cat seizing the rat, the sparrow fearing the *zhan*—
each meets its subduer—how dare they make a sound?
When yin Water receives Fire, it is like the cat catching the field mouse,
the hawk and *zhan* pursuing the crow and sparrow—none dare resist.
Without grasping the principle, idle words are futile.
Without understanding the principle of Metal and Water, one merely harbors deluded thoughts.

Those who exhaust their family’s wealth leave wives and children starving in hunger and poverty. From ancient times to the present, countless millions have pursued this path—yet few achieve harmony, and rarer still are those who succeed. They seek famous elixirs far and wide, but these diverge from the Dao. They chase after mineral medicines, depleting their resources entirely—yet since such pursuits violate the Way, they cannot attain success.

If one truly encounters the proper method and perceives its beginnings and threads, then by matching like with like and measuring the end and beginning of things, understanding follows. "Matching like with like" means Metal generates Water, and Water congeals into Metal. By gauging yin and yang, one knows the cycle’s end and beginning.

The Five Phases overcome one another, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains nourishing fluids; the father bestows essence and endowment. When essence congeals and form endures, even metal and stone do not decay. With focused attention and no leakage, one may achieve the Dao.

*The Divine Pivot: Numinous Control* states: "When the two qi intersect, each establishes the Five Phases. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth follow one another in an unending cycle. Thus, when Metal acts, Water is born; when Water flows, Wood flourishes; when Wood moves, Fire blazes; when Fire flames, Earth levels; when Earth accumulates, Metal forms—this is the mutual generation of the Five Phases, their love for one another. Yet Metal melts in Fire and perishes; Fire is extinguished by Water; Water is blocked by Earth; Earth swells with tumors when Wood takes root; Wood is cut and wounded by Metal—this is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases, their enmity toward one another."

Metal is the father; Water is the mother. When father and mother unite, they receive the essence-qi of Water and Fire. If Water and Fire do not cease, Metal and Water each flow into their forms. When form does not flow, the true Dao is attained. The true Dao refers to the Returned Elixir. It is like setting up a pole to see its shadow, or calling into a valley to hear its echo—how can this not be wondrous? It is the supreme image of Heaven and Earth.

When a pole is set, its shadow appears; when one calls into a mountain, an echo responds—if even these are deemed wondrous and strange, how can the workings of yin and yang not be divine? Yin and yang are the source of Heaven and Earth. Qian and Kun are the root of the Returned Elixir. Heaven and Earth here refer to Metal and Water.

Just as a mere inch of wild aconite or a single ounce of croton, once swallowed, stiffens the throat so one cannot nod or turn—at such a time, even if Zhou Wen, Cao, Confucius, or Bian Que were to wield their needles, or Wu Xian to beat his drums, how could they revive the stricken and restore them to swift movement? This illustrates how wild aconite and croton are poisons that kill when ingested. Metal and Water, by contrast, are the very substances that compose the Great Returned Elixir.

The Maiden of the River’s Ford is most numinous and divine. When she meets fire, she takes flight, untouched by dust or grime. Ghosts conceal themselves, dragons hide away—none know where she abides. Should one seek to restrain her, the Yellow Sprout must serve as her root. The Maiden of the River’s Ford is another name for Water. If she is not united with the Yellow Sprout but burned alone in fire, even if the vessel is a foot thick and sealed with a hundred layers, once the fire stirs, she will flee. Yet the power of the Yellow Sprout to halt her is such that in an instant she vanishes without a trace, leaving not the faintest wisp behind—like a ghost concealed in darkness, like a dragon hidden in the depths of a spring. Even one with the eyes of a black dragon’s pearl could not discern her whereabouts, nor could anything but the Yellow Sprout’s power bind Water to prevent her from scattering east and west. Thus it is called the root of Metal.

Things devoid of yin and yang violate Heaven and forsake the Origin. A hen that lays eggs on her own produces chicks that are incomplete. Why is this? Because the union was not consummated, the Three and Five did not merge, and hardness and softness remained apart. The essence that enacts transformation is the natural work of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are yin and yang. Yin and yang unite to form the myriad things. The myriad things transform as when a female goose eats grain and grows fat, then lays eggs of her own—though they form, no chicks emerge. This illustrates how, without the union of male and female, the origin of such matters remains unattained.

The Three and Five refer to Water, Fire, and Earth. Hardness and softness refer to Metal and Water. If the qi of Water and Fire do not merge, the forms of Metal and Water do not unite. Water and Fire, Metal and Water—all are yin and yang. The essence of yin and yang transforms into the true treasure; the principle of spontaneity admits of no success if violated. It is like fire rising when stirred or water flowing downward when poured—no teacher instructs them to do so. The principle of spontaneity compels them to act thus. Metal and Water depend on each other in the same way. The governance of the Origin’s resources cannot be altered.

The *Xici* of the *Qian* hexagram states: “Great indeed is the Primal Power of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it; it governs Heaven.” This means the transformations of the Dao of Qian cannot be changed or shifted. Qian is Metal. Metal is capable of transformation, hence the analogy is drawn here.

Observe the moment when male and female unite, when hardness and softness bind together so tightly they cannot be separated—this is the attainment of the nodal sign. Hardness and softness refer to Metal and Water; male and female refer to Water and Fire. When the qi of Water and Fire merge, Metal and Water congeal and become inseparable—this is the attainment of the nodal sign. The nodal sign refers to the eight trigrams deploying according to the eight solar terms, arranging yin and yang in sequence with cold and heat. Yet this is not the work of some cunning artificer to control and command. The cunning artificer refers to the Creator of things.

Hardness and softness unite naturally, not by the Creator’s control or command. Consider how, from the moment of conception within the womb, when first receiving the primal qi, the male turns his back to yang and faces yin, while the female turns her back to yin and faces yang—this is not merely observed at birth, but even in death, they replicate the same pattern. This is not taught by parents; it is the natural compliance of yin and yang. The principle is established at the very moment of union. This illustrates how Metal and Water arise naturally, not through human coercion or forced harmony.

Kan’s male is the Moon; Li’s female is the Sun. The Sun conceals its radiance and sinks in splendor, while the Moon extends its virtue and unfurls its light. The Sun receives the Moon’s transformation without harm or injury. The *Shuo Gua* states: "Kan, when sought again, yields the male, hence it is called the Middle Son." "Li, when sought again, yields the female, hence it is called the Middle Daughter." Kan is male, Li is female. In the Kan trigram, yang resides within yin, hence it is called male. In the Li trigram, yin resides within yang, hence it is called female.

The Sun sinking its splendor refers to Metal entering Water. The Moon extending its virtue refers to Water entering Metal. The Moon transforms the Sun, receiving the sign and proceeding anew. Water is transformed by Metal without any loss to its essence. When yang loses its bond, yin begins to encroach. At the conjunction of dark and new moons, obscuration and eclipse occur, as they cover and overwhelm one another. Yang’s form is consumed, and yin’s encroachment breeds disaster. The mutual obscuration of Sun and Moon occurs at the juncture of dark and new moons. When the Moon covers the Sun, it is called a partial eclipse, for yin overwhelms yang. This speaks of Water overwhelming Metal—such is the recurring calamity in the union of yin and yang within Sun and Moon.

Male and female depend on one another, inhaling and exhaling to nurture growth. Here, male and female refer to Metal and Water mutually containing, gradually forming and spreading. Male and female intermingle, seeking their own kind. Male and female are Metal and Water. Metal unites with Water, as like seeks like. When Metal is transformed by Fire, it becomes Water, and Water’s nature flows freely. When Fire is transformed into Earth, Earth cannot move. Metal, receiving Fire’s qi, transforms into Water. Water entering Metal circulates and forms patterns. Fire changing into Earth fills and congeals Water, for Water’s ghost is Earth—Earth fills Water, preventing its rise.

Thus, the male acts and extends outward, while the female remains still and conceals within. The male is Fire; the female is Water. When Fire moves, Water is stored within its vessel. If the measure exceeds proper bounds, the female restrains it. When Metal receives Fire’s qi and scatters into Water, it is instead seized by Water. The po checks the hun, preventing excess or indulgence. The yang spirit is called the hun; the yin spirit is called the po. When hun and po unite, Water does not exceed its bounds. Excess refers to overstepping.

Neither cold nor heat prevails; advance and retreat occur in due season. Each attains harmony, and together they manifest the sign. Observe advance and retreat to await the proper time; follow cold and heat to apply Fire. To know the harmony of Metal and Water, first examine the hexagram’s nodal signs for verification. This is like the dawn of the new moon, when *Zhun* governs affairs, and by dusk, *Meng* takes its place.

Cinnabar and Water Essence unite only when they obtain Metal. Water is born from Cinnabar Water, and when it obtains Metal, its form changes. After this transformation, Metal and Water merge as one. Metal and Water stand side by side; Water and Fire become companions. When Metal and Water harmonize, Water and Fire naturally become neighbors. These four—Metal, Water, Water, Fire—merge in primordial chaos, arrayed as Dragon and Tiger. The Dragon is yang, with an odd number; the Tiger is yin, with an even number. The four refer to Metal, Water, Water, and Fire. When Metal and Water receive the qi of Water and Fire, they remain undifferentiated in chaos. The Dragon, representing Water, is one; the Tiger, representing Metal, is four—thus odd and even.

The liver, green, is the Father; the lungs, white, are the Mother. The kidneys, black, are the Child; qi is the origin of the Five Phases. The liver governs the East, Wood, whose color is green. The East is the position of pure yang, hence it is called Father. The lungs govern the West, Metal, whose color is white. The West is the position of pure yin, hence it is called Mother. The kidneys govern the North, Water, whose color is black. Water is Metal’s child, hence it is called Child. Among the Five Phases, the Child is the beginning of qi. Qi is the source of the Five Phases and the origin of the Returned Elixir.

To speak plainly: green is Wood, white is Metal, black is Water, qi is Fire—red. Three substances form one family, all returning to Wu and Ji. Wu and Ji are Earth. The three substances are Metal, Water, and Earth. Water seeks to depart, but Earth can restrain it, hence it is said they all return to Wu and Ji. Hardness and softness arise in alternation, traversing and distributing in turn. Hardness is Metal; softness is Water. Metal’s position is in the West. When Metal and Water receive Fire, they flow and transform ceaselessly, hence it is said they traverse and distribute in turn.

Dragon in the East, Tiger in the West, warp and weft at Mao and You. The East is the Green Dragon, Wood. The West is the White Tiger, Metal. The Sun and Moon are the warp; the Five Stars are the weft. This speaks of yin and yang interacting like the interwoven threads of warp and weft. The Sun’s rising is Mao; the Moon’s birth is You—Metal and Water. The Sun and Moon are the intermingling of Metal and Water, like warp and weft pursuing one another.

Punishment and virtue converge, meeting with joy. Yang is virtue; yin is punishment. When yin and yang meet, they respond and connect, hence it is called joy. Yin and yang are Metal and Water. When Metal and Water harmonize, joy is likewise the same. Punishment governs killing and subjugation; virtue governs generation and ascent. Yin is punishment, and punishment governs killing.

Yang is virtue; virtue governs generation. This corresponds to the positions of Metal and Water, Water and Fire. In the second month, the elm withers as the Celestial Chief descends upon Mao. At the Beginning of Spring, Wood reigns, and *jia* summons *yi*. *Yi* bears the qi of Metal, returning to respond to *jia*; thus in mid-spring the elm pods are slain. The elm pods, white Mao, serve as the intermediary blossom striking the image of Metal. At the Spring Equinox, the elm pods fall. The qi of Metal resides in Mao, stealthily killing spring.

The *Divine Pivot*’s *Spiritual Linchpin* states: "Mao is the River Chief." In the second month, *jian* is Mao; the Sun and Moon conjoin, and the lodging star resides there. Its spirit is the River Chief. All things are born, each returning to its root, gathering by kind to draw forth Water—hence it is called the River Chief.

In the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the Celestial Hardness occupies You. At the Beginning of Autumn, yang qi resides in You, stealthily generating and bestowing nurturance—thus wheat sprouts. The *Divine Pivot*’s *Spiritual Linchpin* states: "Branches and twigs are fixed; kernels and fruits are all hardened—hence it is called the Celestial Hardness." The elm’s death and wheat’s birth are both instances of yang stealthily bestowing generation and nurturance.

This is the time when Metal reigns and Water enters Metal; when Water reigns, Metal enters Water. *Zi* is south, *wu* is north—each serves as the other’s guiding principle. *Zi* is Water; *wu* is Fire. The qi of Water and Fire intermingle, alternately presiding as the chief.

At the end of nine and one, the end returns to the beginning. It contains the Primordial within the Void and Danger, sowing essence in *zi*. Nine is yang; one is yin. Yin and yang cycle endlessly, concluding only to begin anew. The Primordial is the root of the Dao. This is the Dao of returning cinnabar, arising at the inception of *jian-zi*.

*Guan guan* cry the ospreys, on the river’s isle.
The male does not dwell alone; the female does not abide in solitude.
The osprey is the Yellow Separation.
*Guan guan* is the sound of male and female seeking one another.
This speaks of Metal and Water harmonizing within the vessel, just as the Yellow Separation seeks its mate upon the isle.
That which may be dwelled upon within Water is called an isle.

The Dark Warrior—tortoise and snake—twist and coil in mutual support. The Dark Warrior is the tortoise and snake. When tortoise and snake unite, coiling and leaning upon one another, it is as people today depict a tortoise with a snake coiled around it. This illustrates how Metal and Water, yin and yang, require one another.

To clarify the female and male, they must indeed depend on each other. *Xu* means "to depend." The female and male each seek the other, just as Metal and Water both come together. Thus the tortoise and snake are taken to illustrate this.

Suppose two women share a chamber, their countenances distinct. Let Su Qin convey their words, Zhang Yi arrange the match. With eloquent tongues and persuasive speech, they deploy fine phrases. Pressing sincerity and harmonizing intent, they become husband and wife. Yet their hair decays and teeth rot—ultimately, they do not know one another.

Su Qin and Zhang Yi both studied under Master Guigu, swaying the Six States and persuading them to resist Qin. Yet even so, if two women were made husband and wife, it could not be accomplished. This is like attempting to conjoin two Waters to form Metal—pure yang and pure yin cannot unite.

If the ingredients are not of the proper kind, their names and categories differ. Their measures diverge, losing their guiding principles. It is like casting water upon stone—their kinds differ. If their proportions are further askew, they naturally deviate from the proper order.

Though the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, the Great One holds the fire; the Eight Lords refine and temper, Huainan harmonizes and blends; though they erect lofty altars with jade steps, offer the flesh of qilin and phoenix, spread mats of artemisia, and kneel in long supplication; though they pray to the gods and beseech the spirits, imploring the myriad ghosts; though they bathe and fast in purification, hoping for some result—if the ingredients are already askew, their measures distinct, even if the ancient sages assemble in full, the ghosts and spirits arrive in throngs, and they cut their flesh and open their bellies, nothing will be achieved.

It is like using glue to mend a cauldron, or *yu* to treat a wound; adding ice to dispel cold, or hot water to remove heat; making tortoises fly and snakes dance—ultimately, it cannot be done. All these cases of mineral medicines harmonized with Water to form returning cinnabar are of the same kind, yet they contravene and oppose one another.

The Central Scroll of the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* concludes here.

**The Lower Scroll of the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***
*Commentary by Master Changsheng of the Yin Reality*

Of old, the sages and worthies embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true.
They ingested the Nine Cauldrons’ elixir, transforming and harmonizing the formless.
They contained essence and nurtured spirit, penetrating the virtue/power of the Three Origins.
Essence and fluid governed the principles, sinews and bones attained firmness.
All perverse influences were repelled, the upright qi perpetually abided.
Accumulated over long duration, they altered their forms and became immortals.

The sages and worthies served the Yellow Emperor, who cast the Nine Cauldrons at Mount Jing and attained the Dao.
The first is the Heavenly Radiance Cauldron, the second the Earthly Radiance Cauldron, the third the Human Radiance Cauldron, the fourth the Solar Radiance Cauldron, the fifth the Lunar Radiance Cauldron, the sixth the Stellar Radiance Cauldron, the seventh the Wind Radiance Cauldron, the eighth the Sonic Radiance Cauldron, and the ninth the Numinous Radiance Cauldron.

The Three Origins are the root of qi.
The upright qi is the ancestral source of the Dao.
If one desires to ascend to heaven in broad daylight and accomplish the immortal’s Way, apart from the divine elixir, one merely exhausts the spirit in vain.

Grieving for later generations who cherish the Dao,
they followed the winds and gathered fragments, pointing out and transcribing ancient texts.
They composed diagrams and records to enlighten posterity,
revealing branches and twigs while concealing the root and trunk.
They entrusted their teachings to various minerals, obscuring and confounding the multitude of texts.

Master Wei lamented for those of later generations and composed the *Five Correlative Categories* to clarify the Dao.
Thus, he cited various minerals and interspersed disordered phrases, so that the wise might apply their minds to discern truth from falsehood.
When scholars obtain these teachings, they treasure them within their persons.
Sons inherit their fathers’ work, grandsons follow their ancestors’ footsteps.
Transmitted through generations, confusion deepens, and none perceive or hear the truth.
If one does not comprehend the Way of the furnace and fire, nor fathom the source of Heaven and Earth, even after a hundred generations it remains unknowable—how much more so for descendants?

Consequently, officials abandon their posts, farmers neglect their plows, merchants forsake their goods, and scholars of resolve suffer poverty.
Unaware of the supreme Dao, they squander their wealth in vain.
Such people may be deemed foolish and deluded.

I deeply lament this and have definitively recorded this text.
Master Wei grieved for them and expounded this work.
Its words are concise and easily pondered; its matters are few and not burdensome.
The Four Trigrams and Five Spirits truly exemplify brevity and simplicity in learning.
Unfolding and arraying the branches, the kernel is substantial and worthy of contemplation.
Seeking medicinal substances, they are genuine and not false.
Weights and measures are precise, following one another in sequence.
Thus, disordered phrases serve as apertures and gates.
The wise should reflect carefully and deliberate with intent.

The weights of metal and water are determined according to the line images.
Other miscellaneous numerical explanations are all disordered phrases; the wise should deliberate and discern their true meaning.

No image is greater than Heaven and Earth,
yet the mysterious channel spans ten thousand *li*.
Taking images from Heaven and models from Earth,
though Heaven and Earth are distant, through resonance they communicate.

The River Drum approaches the Star of the Cycle,
and the people are all alarmed.
The River Drum is a single star governing warfare.
The Star of the Cycle lies beside the Northern Dipper.
When the River Drum approaches the Northern Dipper, warfare arises throughout the realm, and thus the people are alarmed.

The sundial’s shadow forgets advance and retreat,
and for nine years misfortune befalls.
This is a metaphor for the use of fire.
Nine is the ultimate number of yang.
The August Sovereign is Earth.
The King is Metal.
When fire reaches its extreme, Earth can subdue it, causing Metal to retreat and reform.
Reform means the water flees and disperses.

The mechanism has its rises and falls,
and like qi, it rushes forth.
The mechanism refers to the failure of firm sealing, so water follows the qi of fire and rushes away.
The Yangtze and Huai rivers run dry,
and water flows into the sea.
Though rivers and seas may dry up, the water in the vessel always flows.

The male and female of Heaven and Earth
revolve between *zi* and *wu*.
Male and female are the two qi of yin and yang.
Yang arises at *zi*, yin arises at *wu*.
Circling and revolving, they do not depart from *zi* and *wu*.
Yin and yang are water and fire.
When metal and water receive the qi of water and fire, they likewise do not transgress the north and south.

*Yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang,
entering and exiting, beginning and ending.
Following the Dipper’s handle in its revolutions,
it holds the balance and establishes the primordial discipline.
*Yin* and *chen* correspond to *mao* and *shen*.
In the month of *jianyin*, yang qi greatly expands, hence it is called *lüshen*.
The spirit of *shen* is the Martial Virtue.
In the month of *jianshen*, all things approach death, and millet sprouts, thus it is called Martial Virtue, signifying it rightly occupies the position of the third line of *Han Zhang*, "containing the latent."
Yin and yang are water and fire.
When metal and water receive the qi of water and fire, they revolve with the Dipper.
The Star of the Balance governs water, meaning metal holds water and establishes the discipline of the primordial origin.

Ascending and roasting upon Mount Fan,
flames of fire spread below.
This refers to the vessel as an image of Mount Fan.
The flames spread below, as in the time of King Wu.
The White Tiger leads the way,
and the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
its flight displaying the five colors.
The Four Spirits lie without, Earth dwells within—this is the five colors.
Encountering the net’s deployment,
it is pressed and cannot rise.
The Four Spirits and Earth together form a net,
restraining and pressing the furnace vessel so that water cannot fly.
Mocking and jesting, the sound is most mournful,
like an infant longing for its mother.

Inversion plunges into boiling waters,
shattering and wounding feathers and scales.
Before half the clepsydra’s measure has passed,
fish-scales surge and throng in restless waves.
Five colors mirror the mysterious radiance,
transformations without constant master.
The cauldron seethes and churns violently,
violent surges ceaselessly rising.
Layer upon layer they pile and press,
jagged as interlocking canine teeth.
Their form resembles midwinter ice,
mottled and dry, spouting stalactites.
Towering and jumbled they mix and merge,
heaped and propped one against another.
All this—water driven by fire’s force,
transformations without constancy.
At times the voice of an infant,
wailing all day without pause;
at others the fury of violent surges,
boiling day and night without rest.
Like a bird with shattered feathers,
or a dragon thrashing its scaled armor.
Now resembling stalactites,
now like solid ice.
Towering and jagged, piled in branching props.
Guarded by the Four Spirits,
harboring the light of the Five Stars.
Their form defies description,
only roughly conveyed in words.
Yin and yang find their pairing,
subtly intermingling in mutual embrace.
Metal and water as mates,
abiding in the vessel of the Dao.

The Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six,
spring blossoms stirring in the east at Mao.
Chamber Six is the eastern constellation;
the Azure Dragon, wood.
The second month, Mao in alignment,
the time when spring’s fire stirs.
The White Tiger resides in Mane Seven,
autumn’s sharpness in the west at You.
Mane Seven is the western constellation;
the White Tiger, metal.
The eighth month, You in alignment,
the time when Metal’s fire flourishes.
At this moment, pure yin governs.
With yin in command,
metal and water both congeal.

The Vermilion Bird in Wings Two,
true yang in the south at Noon.
Fire’s number is two;
the Vermilion Bird, fire’s essence.
True yang in the south at Noon,
where yang wanes and yin is reborn.
All three come to pay homage,
kinsmen leading the chorus.
The three are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird.
The Azure Dragon is wood, the White Tiger is metal,
the Vermilion Bird is fire—three elements in kinship,
joined as companions and leaders.
Originally but two substances,
in the end they become three and five.
Three and five with one,
all gather to correspond to two.
The two substances are metal and water;
the three are water, fire, and earth.
Earth’s number is five, water’s number is one,
fire’s number is two.
Two and one make three—
this is the three and five.
One is the water within the vessel,
two refers to metal and water.
Assembled in the vessel,
only these three remain.

Refine it according to the methods above,
the days’ count also taken from the beginning.
The method of pounding and refining,
the civil and martial fire phases—
all as described in the preceding text,
no need for further repetition.
First white, then yellow,
red and black penetrate inner and outer.
Metal and water in harmony,
their appearance thus.
Named the First Cauldron,
its sustenance like great rice grains.
This is the Yellow Emperor’s First Cauldron.
Daily consuming rice grains,
the Dao is perfected in three years.
A work of nature itself,
not the path of deceit or falsehood.
Bestowed by nature’s own doing,
not achieved by devious means.

Like the qi of mountains and marshes steaming,
giving rise to clouds, wind, and rain.
Mud dries and turns to dust,
fire extinguished transforms into earth.
Like the root used to dye yellow,
or indigo turning to green silk.
Hide boiled into glue,
yeast fermenting into wine.
Kindred substances readily yield results,
while disparate kinds defy craft.
Mercury cast into lead,
the Yellow Sprout naturally emerges.
The Sprout cast into mercury,
the Returned Elixir forms of itself—
these are of the same kind.
Taking mineral medicines,
turning water into gold—
unlike kinds cannot unite,
vain efforts yield no success.

Only this wondrous art,
examined and verified, speaks no falsehood.
Transmitted to countless generations,
brilliant and verifiable as the stars.
Wei Gong feared later generations would not believe,
so he reaffirmed this himself.
Shining like stars crossing the Milky Way,
flowing like water girdling the sea.
Stars entering the Milky Way gleam clearly;
water flowing to the sea, the heart’s light.
Thus when water attains metal,
its appearance is like this.
Ponder it until thoroughly familiar,
examining again and again.
After a thousand cycles, resplendent,
after ten thousand turns, it becomes visible.
The numinous may reveal itself to one,
the soul suddenly awakening.
Grasp the thread and seek its end,
surely finding the gate and door.
The Dao of heaven favors none,
yet is always transmitted to the worthy.
Heaven is impartial, aiding only virtue.
Unceasing sincerity draws the divine.
The divine dons white robes,
following above and below.

The *Cantong Qi* expounds its outline,
yet cannot remain pure and unified,
spilling over in its discourse.
Subtle details remain incomplete,
broad strokes leave gaps.
Now I have compiled and recorded,
filling omissions and oversights.
Polishing the profound,
linking and connecting threads.
Meanings aligned and equal,
their course unerring.
Thus I have composed this,
entitling it *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*,
wherein the essence and nature of the Great *Changes* are fully revealed.
Each adheres to its measure.

The ancients used few words yet conveyed deep meaning;
moderns use many words yet convey little.
Wei Gong feared scholars would struggle to comprehend,
so he refined the text,
composing *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance* to elucidate the Dao of the *Changes*.
*Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance* concerns the mutual resemblance of the five phases.
The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi thoroughly explored,
can be harnessed and applied.
The work of the furnace and fire
has a true basis.
The Yellow Emperor and Laozi of the central realm,
nature’s guardians.
The furnace and fire mirror nature—
to practice this, how could there be no foundation?

In truth, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi are earth,
earth restrains water,
preventing it from flying away.

The Three Ways emerge from one, all following the same path.
The Three Ways refer to metal, water, and fire.
The five phases engender one another, all arising from the one—
thus it is said they follow the same path.
Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves,
fruits hanging in abundance,
all rooted in the trunk.
They do not lose their fundamental nature.
Words spoken with sincerity,
examined and without error.
The trunk is metal and water;
all other miscellaneous teachings are but branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—
not worth taking up.

It resembles the mid-winter season,
when bamboo and trees all wither and break,
aiding the yang to interpret the merchant’s journey,
while the lord deeply conceals himself.
On the winter solstice, yin qi harms all things,
so the former kings on this day closed the passes,
halted commerce, and stilled travelers—
following the season’s command.
Mid-winter refers to the eleventh month.
It mirrors the timely observance of seasonal rites,
sealing the mouth to refrain from speech.
Filling vessels with earth,
not allowing them to open.
The Way of Heaven is vast and boundless,
the Great Mystery without form or appearance.
The emptiness of

The handle is slow, secluded, and crude,
neglecting profit and fame.
Holding fast to tranquility and simplicity,
longing for peace and stability in due time—
this is called the Attendant Xu of the Northern Sea.
The *Cantong Qi* began with Master Xu’s work.
At ease in leisurely retirement,
he composed this text—
this refers to the Wei Lord himself.

He chanted and praised the great *Yi*,
the legacy of the Three Sages.
The great *Yi* speaks of the Dao of the *Changes*;
the Three Sages are Fuxi, King Wen, and Confucius.
Examining their direction,
they form a single, unified discourse.
The Three Sages established the Dao of the *Yi*,
without the slightest deviation.
Their endeavor lay in following principle,
illuminating the spirit.
The transformations of the numinous flow and circulate,
bringing peace to the Four Seas.
That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the numinous.
When yin and yang harmonize in their words,
the Four Seas naturally become clear.
Set forth as a calendar, it is not burdensome;
for ten thousand generations, it may be followed.
Ordered to govern, its practice is effortless.
After the Wei Lord’s refinement,
it may be followed and enacted.

Drawing inward to nurture nature,
aligning with the natural Way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
Abundant in the virtue of containment,
returning to the root and reverting to the origin—
the Yellow Emperor and Laozi possess the guard of spontaneity,
which is the fundamental origin of the Dao, its very source.
The yellow earth does not move—
this may be called the natural.
Close at hand within my form,
not departing from this body.
My form refers to metal;
metal does not leave this body.
Embracing the One, the mother’s abode,
one may endure forever.
The One is water.
When metal embraces water, it attains long life—
this is the mother’s abode.

Discarding the cinnabar of Wudu,
casting aside the Five Stones.
Realgar comes from Mount Wudu.
The Five Stones—mica, arsenolite, magnetite, sulfur, realgar, and the like—
must be abandoned, for the elixir of return forms naturally.
Carefully employing what completes things,
cherished by the common world.
Arranging the three principles,
branches and stems connect as one.

The three principles refer to metal, water, and fire.
Only these three substances form the elixir of return.
Once accomplished, even common people deem it a treasure.
All emerge from a single gate, though known by different names.
The three substances bear many alternate names,
yet all issue from one source.
The wise examine them closely and ultimately awaken.
This is no mere accumulation of phrases to harmonize the text.
I compose this work for the elixir of return—
not to amass empty words.
Its truth is substantial; its structure, though rough, is worth observing.
This text’s framework, though unpolished, remains discernible.
If I were to embellish falsehoods, I would strip away redundancies,
refining the words so that no superfluous phrases remain,
revealing the subtle principles within.
Entitled *The Kinship of the Three*,
its brevity conveys profound meaning—later generations should uphold it.
Few words, vast intent; subtle speech, deep purpose.
Those who study the Dao should revere and follow it.

I relinquish the times and depart this world,
dwelling in the mountains and hills.
Roaming the boundless expanse, I become a neighbor to spirits.
Yu Fan interpreted "committing to the edge and attaching to ghosts" as the character *Wei*,
thus aligning with spirits.
Otherwise, how could one, after awakening to the Dao, walk as a neighbor to ghosts?
Transforming in form, I vanish—
silent and still, without sound.
When Master Wei first ingested the elixir, he transformed and departed.
After his passing, he ascended with his chickens and dogs.
Once in a hundred generations, he descends to wander among mortals.
With feathers spread wide, he soars east and west at will.
When Tang faced adversity, water and drought divided the land,
leaves withered yellow, losing their flourishing splendor—
as when water meets drought, or fire meets aridity.
But the fortunate who carry this method,
who refine the elixir of return,
shall attain lasting peace and long life.

**Song of the Cauldron**
The circle of three and five...

The vessel’s belly is round, its circumference measuring one foot and five inches—each inch divided into ten parts. The vessel’s mouth is bright and open, one inch and one part in width—four times eight. From the upper edge of the mouth to the vessel’s base, the length is three inches and two parts—two inches for the lip. The vessel’s lip is two inches wide horizontally—one foot and two in length, with even thickness. The vessel’s top and belly together measure one foot and two inches, with uniform thickness and smooth similarity. The belly’s alignment is threefold.

At the center of the vessel’s outer belly, three alignment holes are installed, evenly spaced in width. Iron rods are inserted to serve as vessel legs, preventing movement when placed in the fire. It hangs suspended, warm. "Suspended" means hanging an object in space; here, the vessel is hung in the furnace without touching the ground. Yin resides above—water flows within the vessel. Yang rushes below—fire beneath the vessel, the furnace tightly sealed so the fire’s qi rushes downward. The beginning and end are martial: both the initial and final stages employ martial fire. The middle is civil: the central phase uses civil fire.

Initially, seventy—at the start, seventy days of martial fire. Finally, three decades—at the end, thirty days of martial fire again. Two hundred and six, well-regulated and balanced: first, seventy days of martial fire; in the middle, two hundred sixty days of civil fire; last, thirty days of martial fire. In total, three hundred sixty days—one year’s work is complete.

Yin fire is white; yellow sprouts are lead. Yellow sprouts emerge from within lead. Two sevens gather, aiding the person. Seal the mouth with copper sand so the golden water does not fly.

Repair the brain with refinement to stabilize the ascending mystery. Use regulating stone—stone brain secures the boundaries. The child dwells within, secure and preserved. The child refers to water. Water is the metal child, hence called "child." If copper sand refines the stone and stone brain secures the seal, then the child remains secure within the vessel. Coming and going in roaming, yet never leaving the door. The seal firm and tight, water roams within the vessel. Gradually forming earth, nature and essence pure. Metal and water congeal and solidify, gradually reaching firm ice—this is the completion of the returned elixir. Returning to the One, reverting to the root source. Refining metal into metal is reverting to the root. The One is the root source of the Dao. To complete one cycle is most arduous. The work of the returned elixir takes a full year. Day and night without rest—truly laborious. Guard closely, never falter or grow dim. The seal must remain firm and steadfast; no negligence is permitted. The path is distant, the depths profound. A full year is required for completion. The mysteries of the profound and distant transformations are boundless—how could they not be deep and obscure? If one attains this, they harmonize with Qian and Kun. If one grasps the Dao of water and fire, they enter the gate of Qian and Kun. Qian is metal; Kun is water. A single grain adheres, purifying the hun and po. Taking a grain the size of a rice grain is what is meant by "a single grain." Those who delight in the Dao seek its root. Seeking its root source, they do not depart from metal, water, and the like. Examine the Five Phases: metal, wood, water, fire, earth. Determine the weights and measures. One *jin* equals three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the three hundred eighty-four lines. Reflect carefully—no need for debate. Consider deeply; do not discuss with those who are not of the Dao.

Guard it in deep concealment, transmit no texts.
Store them in bamboo baskets and woven chests—do not recklessly pass them to others.
Riding a white crane, you mount dragon scales.
Roaming the Great Void, you pay homage to the Immortal Lords.
Inscribed upon the celestial charts, you are titled a Perfected Person.
After the Dao is accomplished, blessings manifest thus.
