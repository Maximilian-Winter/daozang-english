**Rhapsody on the Gate of the Mysterious Female**

*Title:* Rhapsody on the Gate of the Mysterious Female. Author unknown, likely composed by Lun Gong of the Southern Song. One chapter. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Supreme Mystery Section.

This is the Gate of the Mysterious Above and the Female Below—
A single aperture, the Mysterious Female, the root of the Great Elixir.
It is the Valley of the Void and Origin, the mutual gate of ingress and egress.
The cauldron and vessel are set in noble and base, distinctly opposed;
The mechanism of the primordial merges in opening and closing, subtly beyond words.

Now, the immortals establish the foundation of cultivation:
The primordial qi perpetually circulates above and below,
The lead furnace and mercury tripod are built upon this.
The Jade Palace and Golden Gate—few recognize them.
Vast is the Mysterious Female, beyond naming;
It harmonizes yin and yang, thus it is called the Gate.

Within the furnace and tripod, mercury and lead are concealed,
To the east, it connects with the Valley of Fusang;
To the west, it reaches the summit of Mount Hua.
Grasping the essence of the Two Earths, they wondrously unite;
At the boundary of the Two Phases, they evenly divide.
Vast without exterior, minute without interior—
Below, it is called the Female; above, the Mysterious.

The Cinnabar Tripod, the Moon-Reclining Furnace—
A single mechanism secretly operates the Gate of Returning to Life.
The Cavity of Returning to the Root encompasses all wonders—
All is this Gate.

Yang opens, yin closes; opening and closing are endless.
The sun departs, the moon arrives; going and coming never cease.
Above is the Celestial Gate, receiving Qian and Jia;
Below is the Earthly Portal, concealing Kun and Gui.
Boundless and without sides, it is not of form;
A single enclosure and opening—this is the Gate.

High and low in harmony—great indeed, perfect indeed!
Coming and going, circling and roaming—
Exiting here, entering here.

Pray, what is this aperture? All possess it,
Yet calling it not a gate, it is called the Gate—few in the world know.
For heaven and earth constantly unite in the ceaseless ebb and flow,
And spirit and qi ever merge in unbroken continuity.
Now, this aperture pierces the chaos of primordial darkness,
Forging the foundation of the True One.

By the reckoning of the celestial stems, the Female Below resides in *zi*;
By the arrangement of the Eight Trigrams, the Mysterious Above belongs to the Gate of *Li*.
Such is their division.
Yet the aperture is a unified whole—
Thus, Master Zi Yang exhaustively expounded its rarely known discourse,
Else how would the Old Master have spoken of their shared origin?

It has been said:
The obscure Female Portal lies deep within the azure sea;
The towering Mysterious Gate stands far upon the Kunlun peaks.
One yin, one yang—black and white are discernible;
Neither form nor void—cinnabar and ink cannot depict it.
The Four Cardinal Directions are arrayed here,
Spreading the *gou* and *ban* between *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*;
The Two Luminaries operate here,
Driving the convergence at the dark of the moon, the crescent, and the full.

Subtle! Wondrous!
The two characters "Mysterious Female"—gathered and refined,
A moment’s effort yields:
Below, the White Tiger is concealed as the pivot of kindling fire;
Above, the Azure Dragon stirs the winds and waves of ascent.

Alas! Lesser methods of side gates delude the multitude;
Those who specialize in a single school claim superiority,
Yet if they fail to elucidate the principles of the Learning,
How can they align with the immortal texts?

To name the heart and kidneys as the Mysterious Female is to waste effort in visualization;
To regard the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female is to labor in vain at swallowing and exhaling.
If one abandons the heterodox and returns to the orthodox,
Grasping the true path of the byway,
Then entering the subtle and attaining the wondrous—
How could it lie beyond the gate?

Why not ponder:
The single aperture of spirit—where is the root of gathering and storing?
The inner circulation of primordial harmony—what is the origin of their union?

Moreover, consider:
The White Tiger and Azure Dragon—why speak of a Black Tiger and Red Dragon?
The Mysterious Above and Female Below—what is meant by Left Mysterious and Right Female?

One should know:
Wood and fire take the lead—wood is stored within fire;
Metal and water share a palace—metal lies hidden within water.
This is what is called "mysterious beyond mystery, wondrous beyond wonder."
Its transformations and discourses are endless.

**Poem: Gold in Water**
A speck of bright golden grain,
Its source lies within the water.
Nine returns form the great medicine,
A moment reveals divine power.
The Primordial Sea stirs with yang harmony,
The cold spring’s qi and pulse flow.
In an instant, it becomes a white liquid,
Congealing to fill the Yellow Palace.
Nurtured by the Earth of Kun,
Fanned by the Wind of Xun.
When shall I cherish this treasure,
And seek the Venerable Immortal Lü?

The *Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yi* in one fascicle presents diagrams and explanations, elucidating the utmost mystery at the center of the *Precelestial Diagram*. It corroborates this with the *Triple Concordance Canon*, the *Yellow Emperor’s Hidden Talisman Classic*, and other texts, while integrating the profound discourses of scholars such as Master Yi Chuan and Master Heng Qu. Thus, it reveals what Master Zhu never expounded, further expanding the unspoken intent beyond Master Shao’s words. Though I have not devoted myself exclusively to this pursuit, the wondrous workings of the elixir are not merely understood in passing—I have indeed tested them. Therefore, I dare to directly point out what alchemists have obscured, dispelling the confusions of seekers.

I have often lamented that the transmitted texts of the elixir schools are filled with abstruse phrases and veiled language, leaving readers with no crevice to enter. Dazzled and bewildered, they often close the scrolls with long sighs. Even scholars like Cai Jitong and Yuan Jizhong, who collaborated with Master Zhu to emend the *Triple Concordance Canon*, could only examine its literal meanings; lacking its true transmission, they were reduced to mere conjecture. Now that I have received this teaching, how could I bear to keep it sealed in silence for my own sake? Thus, I append this work to the *Collected Explanations of the Zhouyi* and title it *Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yi*. For though the doctrines of the elixir schools emerge from the *Yi*, they merely borrow and rely upon it—they are not the *Yi*’s original meaning.

The great principles and essentials of the elixir path are thoroughly expounded in this book. As for its subtle and intricate details, they are fully recorded in the three fascicles of *Elucidations on the Triple Concordance Canon*; I shall not repeat them here.

The *Alternative Transmission Beyond the Yi* in one fascicle was composed by my late father and appended to his *Collected Explanations of the Zhouyi*. My father once encountered a recluse who revealed to him the *Precelestial Diagram*, pointing out the utmost mystery at the center of Master Shao’s work. Thus, this book primarily elucidates Master Shao’s teachings.

Recently, the *Exegesis of the Hidden Talisman Classic* was printed. My son, Zhen, requested that this leaf be transcribed and carved alongside it, together with the *Exegesis of the Qin Garden Spring* in three works bound as one, to be shared with worthy scholars everywhere. Hence, we collectively title them *The Orthodox Tradition of Mystical Learning*.

Respectfully inscribed by your son, Zhongwen, with a hundred bows, in the first month of spring in the bing-shen year of the Zhizheng era.

The *Rhapsody on the Gate of the Mysterious Female* is now complete.
