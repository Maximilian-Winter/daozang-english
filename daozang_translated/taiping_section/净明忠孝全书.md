### **Preface to *The Pure Illumination and Loyal Filiality Complete Book***

The world speaks of the Dao of immortals as one of abandoning the world and severing ties with all things—can this truly be so?

Master Liu of Jade Perfection of West Mountain inherited the Pure Illumination Dao of Immortal Jingyang, grounding it necessarily in loyalty and filiality. Without loyalty, there is no lord; without filiality, there is no kin. The eight hundred immortals all follow this Way.

Alas! Without loyalty and filiality, one cannot even be a proper human—how much less an immortal? Yet if one upholds loyalty and filiality, one may still become an immortal—how much more so a human?

As the ancients said: "To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the Dao of humanity." What else is there to rely upon?

**Preface by Zhang Gui, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness and Duke of Cai, Supervisor of the Classics Mat.**

I once served as an official at the Jixian Institute. A Daoist priest from Hongdu, Huang Zhonghuang, presented me with a book, saying: "This is the essential teaching my master, Jade Perfection, received from the Divine Immortal Grand Historian’s Pure Illumination and Loyal Filiality." He humbly requested a preface to perpetuate our Daoist lineage.

How extraordinary! The name and purpose of this teaching—could it not resemble our Confucians’ "illuminating bright virtue" and "cultivating the heavenly nobility"?

The duty of a minister is loyalty; the duty of a child is filiality. This innate knowledge, enduring through the ages, cannot be erased, for the Five Constants are rooted in the human heart.

Benevolence encompasses the Four Virtues and corresponds to spring; thus, practicing benevolence must be rooted in filiality. The four seasons proceed in heaven, and earth flourishes in all four seasons, aligning with sincerity; thus, walking in sincerity must be centered on loyalty.

Therefore, is it not loyalty and filiality that uphold the Three Bonds and the Five Constants?

Alas! The Dao of Yao and Shun was simply filiality and fraternal duty. The Dao of the Master was simply loyalty and reciprocity. From this, we know that the essentials of the Great Dao and supreme virtue lie herein.

The Grand Historian lamented that the world pursued empty mysteries, engaging in idle discourse without earnest practice, drifting ever farther from the Great Dao. Thus, he took the innate principles already present in humanity and opened a simple path for cultivation, transforming customs and guiding the people. His words were near, yet their meaning was profound—how excellent!

I privately reflect: How great is Qian! How perfect is Kun! The former Confucians explained them solely through sincerity and reverence. If a single thought is insincere, it is not loyalty; if a single念 is irreverent, it is not filiality.

If scholars can embody loyalty and enter into filiality, taking the preservation of sincerity and the maintenance of reverence as the gateway to the Dao, and hold fast to them diligently without a moment’s lapse—once their efforts reach fruition, human desires are entirely purified, heavenly principle shines forth, and the empty and numinous becomes radiantly clear—then they will naturally attain the profound subtleties of deep attainment. Thereby, they may unite with heaven and earth, communicate with the divine and luminous, and, without knowing how, arrive at the mysteries of the Great Dao. What difficulty remains?

Daoists refine the spirit and nurture nature—I have not yet reached such heights and thus admire them. Yet in guiding the people toward loyalty and filiality, they align perfectly with the Great Mean and the utmost rectitude. Hence, this book was composed.

**Preface by Zhao Shiyan, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness and Chief Censor of the Jiangnan Regional Surveillance Bureau.**

Since ancient times, the educational systems established by emperors and kings have never failed to take the clarification of human relationships as their primary task.

From the perspective of natural bonds, one must begin with father and son, and the distinctions between elder and younger brothers. From the perspective of righteous union, nothing is more solemn than lord and minister, followed by friends and husband and wife.

Thus, when summarizing these, one invariably speaks of loyalty and filiality.

In an age of great peace, lords are lords, ministers are ministers, fathers are fathers, and sons are sons. Each fulfills their role and cultivates their constant duties, and distinctions between them fade away.

Laozi said: "When the six relations are not in harmony, there are filial children. When the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers." This was because he lived at the end of the Zhou, witnessing the collapse of ethics and the decay of laws and teachings, and thus saw perhaps one or two such exemplars among ten thousand.

His compassion for the world and concern for customs were scarcely different from those of our Master.

However, Daoist teachings, while specializing in nurturing life, also branch into prayers and supplications. Yet世人 merely regard them as remote and detached from this world—this is not the essential discourse.

In the summer of the third year of the Zhizhi era, a recluse said to me: "In the region of Yuzhang, there was an ancient immortal named Lord Jingyang of Xingyang. His teachings to people were also based on loyalty and filiality. He was born during the Chiwu era of the Wu, and by the Taikang era of the Jin, he had lived 136 years before departing this world. Could it be that he observed human affairs, discerned the changes of the世, and thus expounded this teaching?"

Those who nurture life and offer prayers have transmitted this for nearly a thousand years, yet none have examined it closely.

Later, from the Daoist Huang Zhonghuang of West Mountain, I learned of the extraordinary spiritual communion between Master Liu of Jade Perfection and Lord Jingyang. Thus, taking Lord Jingyang’s teachings on loyalty and filiality, they grounded them in Confucianism to uphold their correctness and extended them into Daoism to guide their spirituality.

Several years have passed since the appearance of this book, yet the world still does not comprehend its significance.

Reflecting on the past and contemplating the present, I am deeply moved in my heart—words cannot express it.

Are the deeds of immortals and Daoists merely accidental?

Alas! Heavenly principle and human ethics endure through countless ages, possessing an indestructible principle. If they were to vanish for even a moment, humanity would perish.

Can the learning of immortals and transcendents exist beyond this? Knowing this, then longevity and enduring vision lie herein; the transformation of non-action lies herein.

Those who read well should meet it with their hearts.

**Written with reverence on the tenth day of the fourth month in the first year of the Taiding era by Yu Ji, Erudite of the Directorate of Education.**

The accounts of immortals and transcendents have been transmitted since high antiquity. The Yellow Emperor’s ascension at Mount Dinghu and King Mu of Zhou’s journey to the Jasper Pool are examples.

In later世, those who established teachings and composed books, achieving transcendence and transformation, have appeared from time to time.

Only the Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang cultivated himself through loyalty and filiality to attain the Dao of immortality, and thereby entered the world to save it.

I have often said that his merit does not fall below that of Yu the Great, for he did not merely perfect himself alone. At the appointed time at Longsha, the perfected immortals reappeared, and the wondrous encounter of Yu Zhen is recorded in the *Zhengzhuan* of the *Central Yellow* within his writings—what was once heard of, I have now come to know. The first chapter of his recorded sayings states: "Worldly scholars are accustomed to hearing such words, but here we pursue what is truly real. Not a single thing is deceived, all beings are loved as one. A single deceitful thought is disloyalty; a single filial thought is imprinted upon Heaven." These few principles are the great essentials of human morality and the teachings of the world.

Alas! Those who dwell beyond the mundane, upholding their masters’ words without deviation, transmit them through the generations as though treasuring gold and jade. The learning of rectifying the heart and cultivating the self, practiced with earnest devotion, stands solemnly before us. How should we, as scholars of this fellowship, not bow our heads in deep shame?

Zhong Huang’s appearance was gentle, yet his heart was upright; his discourse was forthright, and his conduct was square. The *Book of Changes* says: *"Yellow skirts bring supreme fortune, for the pattern lies within."* It also says: *"Yellow and central, it penetrates principle, occupies the correct position, and abides in the body."* The meaning of *Zhong Huang* ("Central Yellow") is drawn from this. To rectify the heart and cultivate the self is to be thus. Extending this practice, above it continues the transmission of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang’s loyalty and filiality, and below it reaches all under Heaven and future generations, so that none fail to become loyal ministers and filial children. The teachings of his master—and thus his own—were many, and indeed his master hailed from Yuzhang. How magnificent!

Within the cosmos, form and *qi* mutually depend, and within them, ceaseless movement is governed by principle. Thus, those who obtain the purity of *qi* and comprehend its principle may, if they perfect both self and others, become sages or gods, or if they perfect only themselves, become reclusive scholars or ranked immortals. Those who receive turbid *qi* and remain ignorant of principle are the opposite. Though their ranks vary infinitely, the highest wisdom is rarely seen. Such is our Divine Immortal Lord Xu of Hongdu’s Western Mountains.

Lord Xu once served as magistrate of Jingyang in the Jin dynasty, and the people of the district cherished his governance. Later, having attained the Dao, he came to Jiangxi, and many of his disciples achieved success. The people of the Western River still transmit tales of his slaying of the *shen* and other deeds, revering and honoring him to this day without forgetfulness. Truly, he did not merely perfect himself alone.

Among the Daoist traditions, there are also accounts of ascension and the elevation of entire households, which scholar-officials dare not affirm. Yet their teaching of perfect loyalty and utmost filiality cannot be slandered. The tradition holds that Lord Xu received instruction from the Lords of the Sun and Moon, as well as from the Lady Shen and Master Lan, who transmitted the Dao of loyalty and filiality. Twenty years ago, Master Liu Yuzhen secluded himself in the Western Mountains and again received this transmission. His disciple, Huang Yuanji, compiled his master’s everyday sayings into a book and had it printed and distributed.

In the *guihai* year of the Zhizhi era, I, Zeng Xunshen, an Attendant Gentleman of the Hanlin Academy, obtained this book from Huang and sighed, saying: "If this book circulates in the world, and people come to know how to restrain anger, suppress desires, and illuminate principle to fulfill the reality of loyalty and filiality, then the realm of sages and worthies may be approached and attained. How could this be merely the affair of ranked immortals and recluses?"

The heart of Yuzhen is the heart of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang; the heart of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang is the heart of Heaven and Earth. Fellow scholars of like mind, if you do not neglect this book but deeply savor and reflect upon it, you may yet find resonance within.

**Respectfully inscribed by Zeng Xunshen, Attendant Gentleman of the Hanlin Academy, Probationary Gentleman for Court Service, Co-Director of the Bureau of Historiography, and Compiler of the Bureau of Historiography of Luling.**

The *Wenyan* commentary on the *Kun* hexagram of the *Book of Changes* states: *"The noble person is yellow and central, penetrating principle; yellow is the color of the center."* The Master, in interpreting the *Kun* hexagram, took central correctness as its foundation, enabling it to comprehend the principles of all under Heaven, the vastness of space from Heaven above to Earth below, and the expanse of time from antiquity to the present. That this is not entirely extinguished is due to the principle of central correctness.

Yet in the Spring and Autumn period, it was gnawed by decay, and people mutually destroyed and eroded one another, nearly obscuring principle. The Master, in composing the *Book of Changes* and writing the *Wenyan*, expounded the theory of *"yellow and central, penetrating principle"* precisely to rescue the declining customs of the time and guide all under Heaven back to central correctness. How could the Master have spoken thus out of mere necessity? Had he lived in the age of Yao and Shun, singing and rejoicing as a contented commoner, why would he have needed to exhaustively reveal the secrets of this Dao?

In recent years, at Longsha, a site of soaring phoenixes and perching cranes, a sacred altar was established. Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang personally descended to inscribe the altar record, further expounding the principle of the Central Yellow and transmitting it to Master Yuzhen. The heart of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang is the heart with which the Master sought to save the world. His aim was that all be loyal and filial, neither deviating nor inclining, fully embodying the principle of central correctness, so as to elevate the age to the flourishing peace of a sagely era.

Master Huang of the Central Yellow showed me the *Recorded Sayings of Master Yuzhen*. Upon reading it, I saw that its opening expounds the rectification of the heart and the sincerity of intention, upholding the great norms. It further states: *"Supreme loyalty deceives not a single thing; supreme filiality loves all beings as one."* And again: *"All dharmas are empty; only sincerity is real."* These words truly embody and transmit the essence of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang’s teachings.

Yet this is not merely the essence of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang—it is also the essence of our Master, and the essence of the *"refined unity and holding to the center"* passed down since Yao and Shun. Finally, it clarifies the Daoist sword and iron pillar of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang, which are sufficient to dispel millennia of delusion.

Nevertheless, the mutual elucidation of Divine Immortal Lord Jingyang and Master Yuzhen—how could this have been done out of mere necessity, exhaustively revealing the secrets of this Dao? After reading it, I bowed twice, touched my head to the ground, and wrote this preface to return it.

**Written by Peng Ye, Instructor of the Confucian School of Jianchang Circuit, Probationary Gentleman for Court Service.**

In the summer of the fifth month of the guihai year, my elder brother Sheng Qiming and I together paid homage to Master Zhonghuang in the eastern part of Chengqing Ward in the capital. At that time, eminent guests filled the hall. The Master turned to me and said, "Last night, I dreamed of you. Now that you have come, it seems we share a predestined bond." Thereupon, he bestowed upon me the *Pure Brightness Loyalty and Filial Piety Scripture* along with the *Record of Master Yuzhen’s Teachings*. Before I had finished reading the collection, the myriad doubts of my life dissolved like melting ice.

Several days later, the Master again asked, "What did you make of the *Record* you read earlier?" I replied, "All dharmas are empty; sincerity alone is real. This sums it up." The Master nodded in approval. After a long pause, he said, "Your natural disposition is well-suited to the Dao. You must propagate our teachings—strive on, strive on." He then produced several additional passages from the *Record*, saying, "These have not yet been published. In time, they should be printed together." In the spring of the jiazi year of the Taiding era, I returned south, and by the twelfth month of the yichou year, the Master had shed his mortal form in the capital.

In the autumn of the bingyin year, I journeyed to Yulong to pay respects at the Immortal’s tomb. There, I met Master’s senior disciple, my elder brother Chen Yunyin, in the Hall of Serene Elegance. He showed me the Master’s posthumous manuscripts and the collection of his past responses to various inquiries—all of which I had once heard from the Master himself. Though these were the Master’s words, they were in truth transmissions tracing back to Master Yuzhen.

Later, at the Altar of Hidden Truth, I obtained several passages from the *Record of Master Yuzhen’s Teachings* preserved by Master Xiong of Cangya—precisely those the Master had earlier shown me. I copied them into a separate collection and, together with the *Records of the Numinous Treasure Altar*, *Discourses on the Dao*, *Discourses on the Dharma*, and *Loyalty and Filial Piety Scriptures* originally transmitted by the Yuan, had them all carved into woodblocks and circulated. The entire compilation was titled *The Complete Book of Pure Brightness Loyalty and Filial Piety*.

Those of like mind who read this work should uphold its precepts without fail, revering it as they would the divine and fearing it as they would thunder. Embrace and practice it, and you will return from the posterior heaven to the prior heaven, from the named to the nameless. It is like the sun and moon emerging from darkness into light, heaven and earth transitioning from night to dawn, the four seasons turning from winter to spring. Then, how could one merely ascend to the Jade Capital on a crane or feast at the Jasper Pool of the Queen Mother, content with self-cultivation alone?

One will also witness the transformation of loyalty and filial piety spreading throughout the eight directions. The moral order will be rectified, and heavenly principles will shine forth. Rain and sunshine will be harmonious, and the people will be free from pestilence. Above, this will bring about the flourishing and peaceful governance of sagely rulers and worthy ministers; below, it will enable all creatures, even insects and plants, to ascend together into the realm of benevolence and longevity. Is this not magnificent? Is this not grand?

Respectfully inscribed on the first day of the twelfth month of the fourth year of the Taiding era (dingmao year), by Xu Huiziqi, Disciple of the Pure Brightness, Numinous Treasure, Loyalty, and Filial Piety, the Recluse of Danjiong from Luling, after offering incense and bowing twice.

**Volume One of *The Complete Book of Pure Brightness Loyalty and Filial Piety***
Compiled by Huang Yuanji, Dharma Master of the Pure Brightness Transmission
Collated by Xu Hui, Lineage Disciple
*Transmission of the Pure Brightness Daoist Master, Perfected Lord Xu of Jingyang*

The Perfected Lord’s surname was Xu, given name Xun, and courtesy name Jingzhi. His great-grandfather was Xu Yan, his grandfather Xu Yu, and his father Xu Su. They were originally from Xuchang, men of lofty integrity who never served in office, descendants of the Yingyang lineage. During the Han dynasty, his father fled turmoil and settled in Nanchang of Yuzhang, where the family took root. In the second year of Chiwu of the Wu dynasty (jiawei year), his mother, the Lady, dreamed of a golden phoenix holding a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. From this, she conceived and gave birth to the Perfected Lord.

From birth, he was keenly intelligent, with a refined and imposing bearing. From childhood, he was broad-minded and never clashed with others. Once, while hunting, he shot a doe, which fell, and its fawn tumbled out. The mother deer still turned to lick it, dying before finishing the gesture.

Moved by this, he immediately cast aside his bow and arrows and devoted himself wholeheartedly to study. He mastered the classics and histories, and was well-versed in astronomy, geography, musical temperament, calendrics, the five phases, and apocryphal texts. He was especially fond of the arts of divine transcendents and cultivation, attaining profound mastery. Hearing that Wu Meng of Xi’an had received the divine prescriptions of the perfected one Ding Yi, he journeyed to study under him and was fully transmitted the secrets. Thereafter, with Guo Pu, he visited famous mountains and sought auspicious sites for a dwelling to cultivate the Dao. He obtained the Jin family residence on Xiaoyao Mountain and moved there, making daily cultivation his sole pursuit, seeking neither fame nor position. The village was transformed by his filial piety and fraternal love, and his associates admired his virtue and righteousness. Once, a merchant sold an iron lampstand, and upon seeing the lacquer peeling away, he found it was gold beneath. The next day, he sought out the owner and returned it.

The court repeatedly extended him honors and appointments, and unable to refuse, he was at last appointed magistrate of Jianyang County in Shu during the first year of Taikang (age forty-two). At the outset of his administration, he admonished the clerks to abandon greed and vulgarity, eliminated petty regulations, and freed prisoners from their bonds. He instructed all in the Dao, teaching them loyalty, filial piety, kindness, benevolence, forbearance, prudence, diligence, and frugality. The officials and people were pleased and obedient, all wishing to reform themselves. Previously, famine had struck, and the people had no means to pay their taxes. The commanderies and counties enforced the law, and many fled their homes.

The Perfected Lord then transmuted tiles and pebbles into gold with his divine elixir, secretly burying them in the county garden. He registered those who had not yet paid their taxes and had them perform labor in the garden. When the people tilled the soil and unearthed the gold, they were able to fulfill their tax obligations.

That year, a great plague struck, claiming seven or eight out of every ten lives. The Perfected Lord employed the divine formulas he had been taught to heal the afflicted. Wherever his talismans and incantations reached, the sick recovered instantly, and even those suffering from chronic ailments were cured without exception. People from other commanderies who fell ill flocked to him in the thousands each day. He erected bamboo markers ten *li* beyond the outer walls by the river, placing talismanic water within them, allowing the sick to drink beneath the bamboo. Those unable to come themselves drew the water to take home, and they too were healed.

The people of Shu composed a song in his honor:
*"No theft, no deceit,
Our lord revives the dead,
No illness can withstand his might."*

Foreseeing the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty, the Perfected Lord resigned his post and returned east. The people, grateful for his kindness, followed him in droves, carrying provisions, some accompanying him for a thousand *li* before turning back, others following him home, willing to serve him without returning. On a vacant plot east of his residence, he built a thatched hut resembling a military encampment. Many changed their surnames to match his, and thus the place came to be called *Xu Family Camp*.

Once, while passing through Xinwu, he rested in a grove of parasol trees. Five maidens, each bearing a precious sword, came to offer them. Recognizing them as sword immortals, he accepted the blades with reverence, thereby gaining their divine use.

Later, at Huangtang in Danyang County, he sought the Way from Mother Chen, who transmitted to him the teachings of the *Luminous King of Filial Dao*, along with the bronze talismans and iron charters of the *Filial and Fraternal King* bestowed by Master Lan, as well as the *Golden Elixir and Treasured Scriptures*. She then said to Lord Wu, *"Formerly, you served as Master Xu’s teacher in divine formulas. Now, the Way of the Luminous King of Filial Dao has been transmitted solely to Master Xu. You should now reverse your roles as master and disciple."* The two lords declined, but pledged to visit her every year. Mother Chen perceived their intent and said, *"Do not come again. I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm."* She plucked a blade of fragrant grass, cast it southward, and said, *"When you return, seek the place where this grass falls and establish a shrine for me. A single autumn visit each year will suffice."* The two lords returned and searched south of their dwelling for the grass, which had already grown thick. There they built a shrine, naming it *Huangtang* as well.

Later, they again encountered the Lords of the Sun and Moon, who bestowed upon them the *Pure and Luminous Loyal and Filial Way of the Numinous Treasure*.

Once, the Perfected Lord passed by Huangtang and saw villagers slaughtering animals to sacrifice to the gods, remarking to one another, *"If the offerings are meager, the gods will grow angry and bring disaster."* The Perfected Lord said, *"How dare such malevolent spirits act thus?"* That night, he lodged at an inn and summoned the winds and thunder to strike them down.

He also saw villagers struggling to fetch water from afar, so he thrust his staff into the dry marsh before the earth god’s shrine, causing a spring to gush forth, providing water that never failed, even in drought.

Crossing the river, he arrived at a shop owned by the Zhu family. Though the owner was poor, he received the Perfected Lord with great respect. In jest, the Perfected Lord drew a pine tree on the shop’s wall before departing, and from that day onward, the shop’s business flourished.

He refined his divine elixir on Mount Yellow Dragon in Aicheng, where a flood dragon repeatedly caused floods to sweep away his alchemical chamber. The Perfected Lord dispatched divine soldiers to capture it and pinned it to a stone cliff.

After completing the elixir, he offered it in sacrifice at the stone chamber of Ge the Immortal on Mount Mufu before consuming it himself.

Arriving at Xiuchuan, he admired the swift currents and the firmness of its waters, so he sharpened his divine sword against the rocks by the stream.

Passing through Xi’an County (now part of Fenning), the local earth god came to pay his respects. The Perfected Lord inquired about any malevolent creatures harming the people, but the god concealed them. Passing a small shrine, the shrine deity approached and said, *"Here dwells a flood dragon’s spawn that harms the people. Knowing the Immortal Lord was coming, it fled to Ezhu, but it will return."* The Perfected Lord tracked its trail to a bridge, ordered his divine soldiers to drive it out, and slew it.

Enraged at the Xi’an earth god’s dereliction of duty, he sealed the shrine’s gates and halted its sacrifices. To this day, the City God Temple of Fenning remains closed, and when it is opened, fires break out. The small shrine is still venerated today.

He was later enfeoffed as the *Marquis of Harmonious Assistance*.

The Perfected Lord, hearing of a flood dragon’s spawn wreaking havoc in Xinwu, set out to capture it. The creature, in fear, fled into a mountain stream’s cavern, so he inscribed a talisman upon a massive boulder to seal it within.

At that time, in the upper reaches of Haihun, a colossal serpent had claimed a mountain as its lair, exhaling qi that formed clouds stretching forty li. Those who ventured into its miasma were instantly devoured, and boats on rivers and lakes capsized in its wake, causing great harm to the people. The Perfected Lord gathered his disciples to slay it. As they entered its domain, residents from near and far came pleading for aid. The Perfected Lord declared, *"The cycles of the world turn, and this calamity has befallen you. I have come to eradicate this menace—I swear I shall not share this earth with the serpent!"*

He planted his sword into the ground and silently prayed to Heaven. After a long while, a spring gushed forth, and a red crow flew past. Proceeding to the serpent’s lair, the creature fled into the wilderness. He dispatched a flying talisman, summoning the Haihun earth god to drive it out, but the god failed. He then called upon the Nanchang earth deity for aid. The serpent emerged, its head towering over ten zhang, its eyes like torches, spewing venom skyward. The Perfected Lord roared, commanding wind and thunder, and directed his divine soldiers to subdue it. Wu Jun strode forward, trampling its head and cleaving its brow with his sword. Shi Jun and Gan Jun tore open its belly, from which a smaller serpent, several zhang long, slithered out. It fled six or seven li before pausing, turning back at the sound of clamor as if to gaze upon its mother. The disciples urged pursuit, but the Perfected Lord said, *"It has not yet caused harm—we must not slay it wantonly. If in five hundred years it becomes a threat to the people, I shall return to destroy it. The branches of the pine and cypress before my altar brushing the earth will mark that time."*

He further prophesied, *"One thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure, eight hundred disciples shall arise within the Five Tombs, their master hailing from Yuzhang, who will greatly propagate my teachings. When a deep abyss forms in the heart of the prefectural river, submerging the Sand Well’s mouth, that shall be the time. If the small serpent then causes harm, those eight hundred shall slay it. If it remains harmless, it must not be harmed."* The serpent’s offspring fled into the river. The mountain where this occurred is now known as Wucheng Mountain in Xinjian County.

After the great serpent’s death, its bones formed an isle, now called Serpent Bone Isle. The Perfected Lord established seven *Jing* altars along his route to suppress its lingering influence. This took place in the sixth year of Emperor Huai of Jin’s Yongjia reign, the *renshen* year.

The Perfected Lord’s Daoist arts were sublime, and hundreds sought to become his disciples. Unable to refuse them all, he transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman to test their resolve. Only ten remained unstained by desire. Wherever he traveled across rivers and lakes, none failed to follow.

Upon returning to the prefecture, he surveyed the city and encountered a handsome youth of refined bearing, clad in splendid robes. The youth introduced himself as surnamed Shen, his manners respectful, his speech quick and eloquent, before abruptly departing. The Perfected Lord told his disciples, *"That was no man—it was the essence of an old flood dragon come to test me. I feigned ignorance to expose its kind."* Tracing its path, they found it had transformed into a yellow ox, lying upon the sands. The Perfected Lord cut paper into a black ox and sent it to battle the creature. He ordered Shi Cen to wait until their struggle peaked, then strike. The sword found its mark, slicing the ox’s thigh. It fled into a well south of the city, and the Perfected Lord dispatched talismanic officials to track it, following its trail all the way to Changsha. There, it emerged from the well of Jia Yi, transformed into a man, and entered the home of the jade historian, Jia Yu.

Previously, the flood dragon’s essence had admired Yu’s daughter for her beauty and, taking the form of a youth, sought her hand. Yu, charmed by his talent, wed his daughter to him. They lived together for several years, bearing two sons. Each spring and summer, the youth would depart alone, returning in autumn laden with treasures—spoils from capsized boats. That autumn, he returned abruptly, telling Yu, *"I was robbed and wounded in the left thigh."* The Perfected Lord, disguised as a physician, visited Yu’s home. Upon reaching the hall, he thundered, *"Flood dragon of rivers and lakes, you have harmed countless beings! I have tracked you here—how dare you flee!"* Cornered, the flood dragon revealed its true form and was slain by the divine soldiers. Its two sons, also young flood dragons, were killed as well. Yu’s daughter nearly transformed, but the Perfected Lord gave her a talisman to preserve her human form.

He warned Yu, *"Beneath this dwelling lies water—move at once."* Yu complied, and the ground soon collapsed into an unfathomable abyss. The Perfected Lord returned to Yuzhang, but the flood dragon’s remaining kin, uneasy, transformed into a man and approached his disciples, asking, *"I hear your master possesses a divine sword—may I learn of its power?"* A disciple replied, *"Our master’s sword can split the heavens when pointed upward, cleave the earth when pointed downward, disrupt the stars’ course, and reverse rivers and lakes. No evil dares stand before it—it is a treasure of gods and sages."* The man asked, *"Is there nothing it cannot harm?"* The disciple jested, *"Only winter melons and gourds."* Taking this as truth, the flood dragons transformed their kin into winter melons and gourds, floating them upon the river in a vast, malevolent mass. The Perfected Lord sent Shi Cen to tread upon the water and slay them.

He declared, *"This place is the dwelling of flood dragons and horned serpents. Without suppression, it will bring future calamity."* He commanded spirits and gods to forge an iron pillar at the city’s southern well, fastening it with eight chains to bind the earth’s veins. He intoned, *"If this iron pillar bends, the demons shall rise again, and I will return."* Thus, the water demons were banished, and the city knew peace.

Atop Mount Tiaoxiao’s summit lay three flood dragon lakes, their caverns connecting to the great river and the lands of Rao and Xin. The Perfected Lord slew their flood dragons and established the Yuyang *Jing* altar to suppress them. He also cast iron talismans to seal the mouth of Poyang Lake, blocking the path of flood dragons and specters.

He cast an iron lid to cover the Yuan Pool of Luling, restraining its abyssal depths, and further sealed it with iron talismans, leaving a sword embedded there.

The following year, he traveled again through the prefectures of Changsha, Chen, and Heng, wherever he went eliminating harms for the people, establishing over seventy *Jing* altars in total. In the second year of Emperor Ming’s *Taining* reign, General Wang Dun raised troops and marched inward, halting at the lake. The Perfected Lord and Master Wu went to pay their respects, hoping to persuade him to desist. At the time, Guo Pu was already in the general’s encampment, and through him they gained an audience. Chuzhong invited them to drink and asked, *"I dreamed of a single tree splitting the Heavenly Lord—what do you make of this?"* Master Wu replied, *"A tree splitting heaven above forms the character 'not yet'—you must not act rashly."* Chuzhong’s expression shifted, and he ordered Guo Pu to divine the outcome. Pu said, *"It will not succeed."* Chuzhong asked, *"How long is my lifespan?"* Pu replied, *"If you proceed, disaster will come swiftly."* Enraged, Chuzhong demanded, *"How long is *your* lifespan?"* Guo Pu answered, *"It ends at noon today."* In a fury, Chuzhong commanded his guards to seize and behead Pu. The Perfected Lord raised his cup and hurled it upward—it transformed into a white dove, circling the rafters. When Chuzhong looked up again, the two masters had vanished. Chuzhong ultimately met defeat.

The two masters returned to Jinling, where they summoned dragons to bear their boat, journeying from the Purple Cloud Peak of Mount Lu’s Golden Palace Grotto back to their abode. Arriving at Heavenly Treasure Cave, they returned to their former seclusion. For decades afterward, they devoted themselves to expounding the true principles with their disciples, no longer concerning themselves with worldly affairs. In their daily comings and goings, they appeared no different from ordinary men, save that their dwellings were graced by the flight of singing cranes and the swirling of auspicious clouds.

On the first day of the eighth month in the second year of Emperor Xiaowu’s *Ningkang* reign, a celestial procession descended from the heavens. Two immortals alighted in the courtyard and proclaimed the Jade Emperor’s decree:

*"By imperial edict: To the youthful adept of the Dao, Xu Sun, who across countless kalpas has diligently cultivated the supreme Way with unwavering devotion, mastering its profound warp and weft, traversing its myriad methods and thousand gates—none have you not experienced. In rescuing the distressed, averting calamity, eradicating harm, and dispelling demons, your merit has aided the people, your name exalted in the Jade Register. The host of perfected beings reveres you; thus, you are deemed worthy of promotion. You are hereby appointed Supreme Immortal of the Nine Provinces and Grand Scribe, concurrently High and Illustrious Envoy, bestowed with a purple-feathered robe, a jade banner, a ceremonial staff, a jade elixir, and a measure of golden cinnabar. The decree is to be received and obeyed."*

The Perfected Lord bowed twice, ascended the steps, and accepted the decree.

One immortal declared, "I am the Supreme Lord of Jade Perfection, Cui Ziwen."
The other immortal declared, "I am the Supreme Minister of Primordial Perfection, Xiaqiu Zhong."

They informed the Perfected Lord of the appointed hour for his ascension and then departed. The Perfected Lord summoned his disciples and the elders of his hometown, announcing his departure and hosting a farewell feast. He also composed ten pentasyllabic poems in a single rhyme, each admonishing and exhorting his eleven disciples.

On the sacred day of that month, a grand vegetarian feast was prepared, and all—young and old—gathered. At midday, music was heard from afar, auspicious clouds spread in all directions, and a dragon-drawn chariot adorned with feathered canopies arrived, accompanied by attending officials, guards, immortal youths, and maidens leading the procession.

The two decree-bearers arrived once more and proclaimed:
"By the supreme decree of the Jade Emperor to the youthful cultivator of immortality, Xu Xun: The records of your past-life transgressions—greed, killing, and concealing sacrifices to your ancestors—are now absolved. In this life, your merits in wielding talismans and sacred water, healing the sick, punishing evil, and subduing toxins have been duly recognized. The Controller of Life of Mount Qian has transmitted the golden elixir to the mortal realm, sealing your karmic debts and transforming your body, household, and all possessions to ascend to the Three Heavens. Purify yourself swiftly, turn from the earth, and rise into the void. The Celestial Guardian of Great Strength on your left, along with the Flowing Gold Fire Bells, shall illuminate and shield your central elixir field, lest it scatter.

Furthermore, your distant ancestor You is hereby appointed Vice Minister of the Jade Void; your great-grandfather Yan, Grand Master of the Guards of the Grand Tenuity; your grandfather Yu, Keeper of the Registers of the Supreme Ultimate; and your father Su, an immortal official of the Central Marchmount. Your residence is bestowed the title *Left Palace of the Immortal Court*."

The Supreme Lord of Jade Perfection said, "Though your disciples are many, only six are fit to accompany you. The rest shall each have their own day of transcendence." He then bowed to the Perfected Lord, who mounted the dragon chariot. Chen Xun carried the imperial tally in the lead, while Zhou Guang and Zeng Heng drove the carriage. Huang Renlan and his father’s clan attended, as did Xu Lie and his mother’s retinue. Forty-two members of the immortal household ascended together, even the chickens and dogs soaring in their wake.

A stone casket and a cultivation bell were left behind with these words: "As the world changes and time passes, these shall become relics—let them serve as a record."

A servant named Xu Da and his wife were purchasing rice at West Ridge when they heard of the Perfected Lord’s ascension. They rushed home, but their cart overturned, scattering rice upon the ground—where it sprouted anew. Upon arrival, they wept and begged to follow. The Perfected Lord then taught them the arts of earthly immortality, and the couple concealed themselves in the mountains.

After the immortal procession had departed, a mortar and a chariot hub fell from the sky, followed by a chicken coop and several mice. Though the mice dragged their entrails upon landing, they did not die—likely having stolen and consumed the elixir. Later generations would regard these as auspicious omens.

Earlier, upon returning from Jingyang, the Perfected Lord had presented Shu brocade to Lady Chen, who fashioned it into a palace curtain. Now, it suddenly flew back, swirling above his former home before vanishing into the clouds.

The Perfected Lord was born in the second year of the *Chìwū* reign of Sun Quan, Emperor of Wu—on the twenty-eighth day of the first month in the year *jǐwèi*—and lived for one hundred thirty-six years. All disciples of the Pure Brightness tradition revered him as *Master of the Dao*.

After his ascension, the villagers and his kinsman Xu Jian established a shrine on the site. The one hundred twenty poems he had left behind were inscribed on bamboo slips, which people drew to divine fortune or misfortune—known as the *Sacred Lots*. The bell, chariot, casket, and mortar were all preserved within the shrine. During the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui, the shrine’s renovations were abandoned.

During the *Yǒngchún* era of the Tang, Celestial Master Hu Huìchāo revived and rebuilt the shrine, and Emperor Xuánzōng of the Tang honored it with particular reverence. The Song emperors Taizong, Zhenzong, and Renzong all bestowed imperial calligraphy upon it, renaming it *Yùlóng* and forbidding logging or gathering on the sacred mountain while exempting it from taxes and levies. In the second year of *Zhènghé*, Emperor Huizong conferred a jade investiture, bestowing the honorific *Perfected Lord of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation*. In the sixth year of *Zhènghé*, the temple was elevated to the status of a palace, with the additional title *Wànshòu* ("Ten Thousand Longevities"). On the first day of the fifth month, an edict was issued to the Ministry of Rites:

"While reading in the *Chóngzhèng* Hall, I was suddenly overcome as if in a dream. I saw a Daoist at the northern gate of *Dōnghuá*, wearing a *jiǔhuá* crown and a crimson ritual robe, flanked by two youths in blue holding swords and tethers. Behind them, two envoys in colorful Daoist attire bore an official seal and staff. Approaching the vermilion steps, the Daoist bowed, then ascended the left dragon-tailed staircase to the hall.

I suspected he was no ordinary mortal and asked, 'Who are you, that you arrive unsummoned?'

He replied, 'I am Xǔ Jīngyáng, temporarily overseeing the Nine Heavens’ offices. The Supreme Emperor ordered me to inspect the kingdom of *Xīqúyé*, and passing through my former homeland, I observed inauspicious qi. Thus, I came to call.'

I invited him to sit and asked, 'What is the nature of this affliction?'

He answered, 'In Húnán and Húběi, thirty-six thousand bolts of tribute silk have sunk into the waters—this is the work of a lesser dragon. It was improper for a former dynasty to enfeoff this creature as a king. During the *Yǒngjiā* massacre, it tore open its mother’s belly to flee, but before it could harm others, it was pardoned. Now, it dares to trouble the realm. Upon my return, I shall take measures to prevent it from lingering in the Jiāng-Huái region.'

In my dream, I expressed my gratitude, then asked, 'I suffer from *ānxī* sores, and no medicine has cured them. Do you possess a remedy?'

He took a small gourd, poured out a single pill the size of a mung bean, breathed an incantation over it, and applied it to the sore. I felt as though liquid butter flowed through my body, cooling my bones with a refreshing chill.

He then bowed and departed. After a few steps, he turned back and said, 'My humble abode has long been desolate. I would be most fortunate if Your Majesty would glance upon it.'

I awoke with a start."

Within days, officials reported that the silk transport had indeed been capsized by wind and waves. Consulting the illustrated classics, they found that in Fènníng County’s Méi Mountain stood the Xǔ family’s Grinding Sword Pool. An edict was issued to have an image painted as seen in the dream, which was then bestowed upon the Shàngqīng Chǔxiáng Palace, its construction funded by reallocated provincial treasury funds.

Months later, the Perfected Lord appeared again in a dream as before. He bowed to the throne and said, "Fènníng is where I once walked in former times. Your repeated labors in building there are deeply felt. I have divined the site: the traces on Xī Mountain remain intact, yet the halls are cramped and shabby, unworthy of the gaze of those who come from all directions. I would be most fortunate if Your Majesty would renovate them once more."

Awakening, the emperor immediately issued a decree to Hóngzhōu, ordering the reconstruction of the Yùlóng Wànshòu Palace.

During the Jiàn Yán era, when Jurchen invaders ravaged the lands east of the Jiāng, they sought to burn the palace halls. Suddenly, water gushed forth from between the pillars, and the flames would not catch. The barbarian chieftain was struck with awe and inscribed upon the wall:

*"The Dragon-Tiger General of the Great Jin, having come to offer allegiance, was appointed Supreme Commander of the Upper Flank of the Marshal’s Headquarters. When our great army sought to destroy this place, we beheld the sacred images, their adornments resplendent and majestic. We dared not burn them to ashes."*

This was recorded on the second day of the first month in the eighth year of Tiānhuì.

The commander, perceiving the divine will, withdrew his troops in full.

All relics left by the Perfected Lord are guarded by spirits and must not be violated. The cypress he planted before the palace hall flourishes or withers in accordance with the rise and fall of the palace; its pruned branches, boiled into a decoction, cure all ailments without fail. The cinnabar well was once frequented by a divine dragon, until Master Hu of the Hu Cave sealed it with talismanic stones and an iron pillar. During the Tang dynasty, Yan Zhuan, the prefect of the province, harbored deep skepticism. Once, he ordered the excavation of the site, but suddenly fierce thunder, violent winds, and surging river waves arose, shaking the city walls. Terrified, Yan kowtowed in repentance, and only after a long while did the disturbance cease. He also forcibly took the cultivation bell and placed it in a Buddhist temple, but when struck, it produced only the dull sound of wood or earth. It was then returned to the palace. Prefect Xu Deng of Chegu Province ordered the bell brought to his residence, but before he could even inspect it, it flew back that very night. The stone casket, though cracked, cannot be opened. When Zhang Shan’an of the Tang usurped Hongzhou, he forcibly chiseled it open. Inside the lid was an inscription in cinnabar: *"Five hundred years hence, the mad rebel Zhang Shan’an shall open this."* Frightened, Zhang attempted to grind away the characters, but they could not be erased, so he concealed the lid. All relics of the Perfected Lord possess extraordinary properties. For instance, the Sword-Grinding Pool beside Dragon Sands—its walls of sand stand sheer and never silt up. The Lamenting Drought Lake in Xinjian County teemed with leeches, but after medicine was cast into it, they vanished forever. The inn at Songhu Market has remained free of mosquitoes and gnats to this day. In Miaozhen Cave of Fengcheng County, a flood dragon once entered, and a cedar wedge was driven into the cave; it remains unrotted to this day. In Cang Brook of Fengxin County, a flood dragon concealed itself, so a sword was used to split the massive boulder beside the stream, and a talisman was inscribed to seal it. Such examples are too numerous to recount.

Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan dynasty bestowed upon him the honorific title: *Perfected Lord of the Utmost Dao, Mysterious Efficacy, Divine Merit, and Wondrous Salvation*.

**Biography of Master Hongya, Preceptor of the Pure Brilliance Scriptures**
The preceptor’s surname was Zhang, his given name Yun, his style Hongya, and he was also called Yun, with the courtesy name Cangzhen. His lineage remains unknown, for he and Red Pine were both teachers of the Divine Farmer. The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: *"Master Hongya is now the Immortal Earl of Mount Qingcheng."* During the Sui dynasty, he reappeared on Mount Gushe in Jinyang, and later on West Mountain in Yuzhang. He read books and fished on the stone ledge by the riverbank west of the city—now known as the Fishing Terrace. In the ninth year of the Kaihuang era, Yuzhang was renamed Hongzhou in his honor.

The master stood seven feet and five inches tall, with sparse yet elegant brows and eyes, and a voice resonant as a bell. He excelled in the zither and calligraphy and delighted in long whistling. He once encountered the Lords of the Sun and Moon, who bestowed upon him the teachings of the Pure Brilliance, Numinous Treasure, Loyalty, and Filial Piety. At times, he wore a black gauze cap; at others, a scholar’s turban or a headband of untrimmed hazel branches. He donned a deerskin robe or a red-brown linen shirt with a black rhinoceros-hide belt and short boots. When traveling, he rode a white mule named Snow Essence, accompanied by five strange-looking youths named Orange, Chestnut, Wood, Kudzu, and Stump. He carried a hexagonal fan, a cloud-shaped bamboo hat (also called a white rattan hat), a square wooden lamp, the *Twofold Mystery* scriptures, a wooden ruyi scepter, a walking staff of giant bamboo, a gourd of longevity, the Vessel of Wei Hui, the Unpropped Ladle, the Ever-Full Flask, and the Ever-Brimming Cup, from which wine flowed naturally. He moved in and out of cities, appearing at dawn and vanishing by dusk, his whereabouts unfathomable. During the Shengli era of Empress Wu of the Tang, she summoned him, but he did not go.

During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong, he was again summoned to the Zhanlu Hall. The emperor, in leisurely conversation, asked, *"I have heard that you are skilled in the long whistle. Might I be permitted to hear it?"* Thereupon, he responded with a sound, its tones pure and transcendent.

The emperor said, *"How do I compare to Yao and Shun?"*
*"And how do you compare to Xu You?"*

The master replied, *"Your Majesty’s Dao surpasses that of Yao and Shun, while my virtue falls short of Xu You’s. In ancient times, Yao summoned Xu You, yet he did not come. Today, Your Majesty summoned me, and I have come."*

The emperor praised him and offered the post of Minister of Ceremonies, later promoting him to Minister of Education, but he declined all appointments. One day, he petitioned, *"Why does Your Majesty begrudge a single mountain or stream, preventing me from following in the footsteps of Chao and You?"* Thereupon, the emperor issued an edict permitting him to return to the mountains. He then ceased eating grain and cultivated qi, appearing and vanishing at will between the Western Mountains and Mount Guye, often wandering among the Zhongnan, Taihua, Qingcheng, and Wangwu ranges. He kept company with the two great masters, Dong and Luo, frequently discoursing on the affairs of the Golden Elixir and the Flowery Pond, as well as the arts of bodily transformation and alchemical refinement—mysteries no one could fully fathom.

Each morning, he would ride his white mule, leading his attendants from the Western Mountains across the Zhang River into Hongzhou. Yet no one ever saw him return. One day, a boatman on the Zhang River grew deeply curious and instructed his son to follow and observe. The master wandered the markets selling medicines, then suddenly arrived at the former residence of Peng Xian, the Jin dynasty minister in Wuyang—now the Pengzhen Abbey, a land of flourishing fortune. There, with his fellow seekers of immortality, he swept the stones, burned incense, discoursed on the profound, perused secret texts, played weiqi and backgammon, and chanted poetry for hours.

Afterward, he mounted his white mule with his attendants and entered the old alchemical well of Peng Xian, vanishing within. The boatman’s son, still trailing him, remained unaware. The path inside was smooth and level; after traveling some distance, he suddenly heard the sound of an oar. The son exclaimed, *"That is the sound of my boat’s oar!"*

The master, realizing what had happened, questioned him, and the son truthfully recounted the matter. The master then asked, *"Do you wish to accompany me?"*
*"I do not,"* he replied.

Thereupon, the master had him close his eyes, placed his hand upon his crown, and in an instant, the son found himself back in the boat. From that day on, the master never again entered the city. Thus it continued for ninety-three years, after which he concealed himself, his whereabouts unknown.

Now on West Mountain stands the Hongya Well, neighboring the Wuqing Spring, its depths unfathomable. Through winter and summer, torrents surge and roar like thunder beneath the earth, so that even when men speak face to face, none can hear. In the scorching heat of midsummer, a chill wind strikes, raising every hair on the body. Ancient tradition holds that this well connects with Peng Xian’s alchemical well.

Beside the well grow many maple trees. When the master’s elixir was complete, he mounted a snow-white spirit steed and ascended to the Cloud Realm from the maples—even now, traces of the snow spirit remain upon the trees.

To the west of the well stands the Purple Clarity Palace, once called the Responding Sage Palace, where the master cultivated his true nature. Three poems are carved upon its stone:

The first:
*Last year I had no fields to sow,*
*This spring no wine to brew.*
*Let the crows and blossoms mock—*
*I’ll feign drunkenness and lie upon the tower.*

The second:
*My low tunes find no listener,*
*My lofty heart draws only scorn.*
*I know not the ways of the world,*
*How then should I live as a man?*

The third:
*I enter the market not for gain,*
*I pass the court not for fame.*
*At times I mingle with the vulgar,*
*Yet still I wander, restless, the same.*

He once annotated the *Laozi*, the *Book of Changes*, the *Three Ritual Classics*, and the *Guliang Commentary*, which circulate in the world. All who study the Pure Brightness teachings revere him as the Master of Scriptures.

*The Transmission of the Pure Brightness Dharma Master, the Cavern-Realized Master*

The master’s surname was Hu, his given name Huichao, also called Huasú, with the courtesy name Basú. No one knew his place of origin, nor could his age be determined. When asked, he would say, “This year I am fifty-two,” and even decades later, he would give the same answer. Yet his bearing was majestic, his presence towering. Alone, he seemed no different from an ordinary man, but among crowds, he stood a head above the rest—thus the people of his time called him Hu the Tall Immortal.

When meeting others, he never clasped a ceremonial tablet, but merely raised his fists in greeting. Once, he encountered the Lords of the Sun and Moon, who bestowed upon him the Way of Pure Brightness, Numinous Treasure, Loyalty, and Filial Piety—mysterious and boundless, beyond mortal comprehension.

In the early Tang, he concealed himself in the Hong Well of West Mountain in Hongzhou, though he would occasionally visit Hong City. One day, while strolling through the market, he saw a family in mourning. When he asked the reason, they replied, “Beside the city stands a temple deity who each year selects a maiden as his bride. Tomorrow, my daughter is to be taken—hence our grief.”

The master said, “I shall rid you of this.” Then, with a whistle, he summoned wind and thunder, burning and smiting the temple. Beneath a great camphor tree beside the temple, countless bones were unearthed. He tore out the roots and cast them into the river, where they floated upstream to the borders of Qingjiang. The place is now called Camphor Tree Town.

The people of the prefecture, moved by his deed, built an abbey where the temple had stood—today’s Yuzhang Mysterious Wonder Abbey. During the Zhenguan era, Emperor Taizong heard of him and summoned him, but he did not go. When Gaozong ascended the throne, he summoned the master again, and this time he went, lodging within the palace precincts.

At that time, a demon haunted the palace, emerging at night to harm people. The emperor said, “There is a demon within the palace precincts—can you, Master, expel it?” The master replied, “Very well.” He then traversed the entire palace and, upon reaching the western palace wall, pointed and said, “The demon lies here.” He ordered the imperial guards to dig, and after several feet, they unearthed over a dozen old foxes, along with a great many bones. Once slain, the demonic disturbances ceased. The emperor was greatly pleased and offered rewards, but the master declined them all, insisting on returning to the mountains. The emperor granted his request, and a farewell banquet was held by the court officials. The emperor himself composed a poem in parting, after which the master returned to reside at the Youwei Abbey on West Mountain.

At the time, the abbey lay in ruins. The master asked the abbot, “Why have you not repaired it?” The abbot replied that they lacked the funds. The master then set out alone and, within a month, had rafts of camphor wood brought from Gao’an. The river’s mouth lay ninety *li* away, so he instructed the raftsmen to secure the rafts tightly and rest along the bank. As dusk fell, he inscribed a talisman in flight and cast it into the air. By midnight, a fierce wind and thunderstorm arose, and by dawn, the rafts had arrived at the abbey’s base. The path through the ravines and valleys was swept clear, the forest trees felled as if by a scythe. He then unearthed a vault at the foot of the mountain, from which he retrieved three hundred thousand coins to meet the needs of the laborers.

The halls and chambers were not built by human hands—all were constructed by night through the labor of spirits and gods. Outside the gates, seven wells were dug to suppress fire disasters.

Empress Wu later summoned him to the Hall of Martial Accomplishment and inquired about the affairs of divine transcendents. The master spoke only of the roots of Dao, virtue, and the transformative governance of emperors and kings, then begged leave to return to the mountains. An imperial edict dispatched envoys bearing gold and jade to escort him home. As he journeyed, the Prefect of Shanfu sent a letter, saying: “Master, your Dao and virtue stand lofty and pure, having long transcended the dust of the world—like Guangchengzi of the Xuanyuan era or the Old Master by the River in Han times. Thus you came from afar to answer the summons of the Three Rivers. Now the sun’s chariot has departed early, and your rainbow robes fade into the distance. After crossing the Heavenly Ford, the crane-borne canopy grows ever more remote. Gazing vainly at the winds and clouds, my sorrow knows no end.”

Returning to the ancient altar of Master Hongya to refine the elixir, he remained for three years. An imperial decree urgently summoned him to court, where he was lodged within the palace precincts, yet one morning he vanished without trace. The emperor sighed in deep regret and sent envoys with lavish gifts. He then returned to reside at Xumu Jing on West Mountain, saying: “Long ago, I came here as a guest of Xumu. Now, several centuries have passed.”

In the third year of the Chang’an era, he commanded his disciples to build a brick tomb at Fuling, northwest of Youwei Abbey, concealing within it two talismans of the Supreme Mystery, one Seven-Star Sword, and one Numinous Treasure Staff. The work was completed in three days. The master then straightened his robes and cap, seated himself upon the rope bed, as clouds and cranes swirled in the air above, and the sounds of men and horses filled the space beyond the walls. And thus the master departed this world.

The prefecture reported the matter to the court, which bestowed upon him the posthumous title *Master of Penetrating the Real*. All disciples of the Pure Brightness tradition revered him as *Dharma Master Jun*.

**Biography of Master Guo, Preceptor of the Pure Brightness Ordination**

The master’s surname was Guo, his given name Pu, and his courtesy name Jingchun. A native of Hedong, he was fond of classical learning, widely read, and possessed of extraordinary talent, though reticent in speech. His *fu* rhapsodies were unmatched in the Eastern Jin. He delighted in ancient scripts and rare characters, and excelled in the arts of yin-yang and divination.

There was a certain Master Guo, a sojourner in Hedong, who was deeply versed in the arts of milfoil and tortoiseshell divination. The master became his disciple. The elder Guo bestowed upon him the *Nine Scrolls of the Green Satchel*, through which he mastered the five phases, astronomy, geography, and the techniques of divination. In averting disasters and transforming misfortune, his methods were wondrous and boundless.

During the reigns of Emperors Hui and Huai, the master foresaw the coming chaos in the Central Plains and so took refuge in the southeast. Arriving at the camp of General Zhao Gu, he found the general mourning the death of his prized steed and refusing to receive guests. The master said, “I can revive the horse.” An attendant announced this, and the general emerged to seek his counsel. The master instructed, “Gather twenty or thirty strong men, each with a long pole. Proceed thirty *li* east to a wooded mound where a shrine stands. Strike the shrine with the poles, and you will seize a creature—bring it back swiftly, and the horse will live.” Zhao Gu followed his words and indeed captured a creature resembling a monkey, which he carried back. Upon seeing the dead horse, the creature exhaled into its nostrils, and in an instant, the horse rose as if unharmed. The creature then vanished.

After Emperor Yuan crossed the Yangtze, Wang Dao appointed the master as his aide. The master served his mother with utmost filial piety. When she died, he personally divined a burial site at Jiyang, a mere hundred paces from water. Others warned of the proximity to water, but the master replied, “It will soon be dry land.” Before long, silt accumulated, and the grave lay several dozen *li* from water, the surrounding area transformed into mulberry fields.

In the second year of the *Tai Ming* era of Emperor Ming (the *jiashen* year), Wang Dun raised an army in rebellion and encamped at Lake Dongting. The master went to see him. Wang Dun said, “I dreamed of a single tree splitting the sky—what omen is this?” The master replied, “A single tree splitting the sky forms the character *wei* (未, ‘not yet’). Your enterprise, my lord, will surely fail.” He then expounded at length on the great principles of loyalty and filial piety.

Wang Dun, enraged, asked, “How long is my lifespan?” The master replied, “If you steadfastly uphold the duty of a minister, your years cannot be measured. But if you do not swiftly amend your ways, disaster will come soon.” Dun said, “How long is *your* lifespan?” The master answered, “My fate ends at noon today.” Dun grew even more furious and ordered his execution. Yet soon after, the master was seen in the market of Danyang, and the world took this as a case of *bingjie* (transcendence through martyrdom).

His writings included tens of thousands of words in poetry and rhapsodies denouncing worldly vexations, the sixty-scroll *Scripture of the Grove of Caves*, the ten-scroll *New Grove*, and the *Divination Rhymes*. His annotations on the *Erya*, *San Cang*, *Fangyan*, *Tale of King Mu*, and *Classic of Mountains and Seas* all circulated in the world. All disciples of the Pure Brightness tradition honored him as the Venerable Master of Supervision.

**Biography of the Reclusive Master of Jade Perfection from West Mountain**
The master’s surname was Liu, his given name Yu, and his courtesy name Yizhen. *Yuzhenzi* (“Master of Jade Perfection”) was his sobriquet. His ancestors hailed from Shimen in Fanyi, and his great-grandfather Zonghan moved to Jianchang in Nankang, naming his residence Shimen to show he had not forgotten his roots. During the Shaoxing era of the Song, he passed the imperial examinations and was appointed as a registrar in Lai’an, Chuzhou. His family had long transmitted the traditions of poetry and ritual propriety.

His father was Gang, and his mother was née Wu. He was born on the twentieth day of the eighth month in the *dingsi* year of the Baoyou era (1257). That morning, a crimson glow enveloped the house, startling the neighbors. His father later moved the family to Zhongxiao Township in Xinjian, Longxing. From childhood, the master possessed extraordinary insight. At five, he began his studies, striving to grasp the great principles. Upon reaching adulthood, both his parents passed away in succession, and he observed mourning rites with utmost devotion. Though his family was poor, he tilled the land to sustain himself, regarding worldly affairs as beneath concern. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to the study of immortals and transcendents.

Earlier, the Perfected Lord Xu, the Grand Scribe of the Capital of Immortals, had ascended to the heavens in the *jiashu* year of the Ningkang era of the Jin (374) at West Mountain in Yuzhang. Before departing, he left behind a prophetic record: “One thousand two hundred and forty years after my ascension, within the Five Mounds, eight hundred disciples will emerge as earthbound transcendents—though the text mistakenly reads ‘eight hundred.’ Their master will arise from the west bank of the river in Yuzhang. When a sandbar suddenly appears in the heart of the prefectural river, extending past the mouth of Shajing, that will be the time.” By the *wushen* year of the Jianyan era (1128), barely seven hundred years had passed, yet warfare raged, and the people suffered terribly. He Zhen’gong and others prayed to the Perfected Lord, beseeching salvation. Soon after, the deity descended upon Yuchuan, revealing that on the full moon of the eighth month in the *xinhai* year, he would descend upon the Jade Prosperity Palace. When the appointed day arrived, they awaited his arrival. At noon, clouds and mist surged from the heavens, descending from the west of the hall and ascending to the Jade Register Hall, where he bestowed the *Scripture of the Flying Immortal for Delivering Humanity: The Great Rites of Pure Brightness, Loyalty, and Filial Piety*. Zhen’gong received it, established the Winged Perfection Altar, and transmitted the rites to over five hundred disciples. Through their exorcisms and prayers, the people found peace. Yet over two hundred years later, the teachings had nearly faded into obscurity.

In the *renwu* year of the Yuan (1322), the imperial court renamed Longxing Circuit as Longxing Prefecture. That year, in the fifth month, a sandbar emerged outside Zhangjiang Gate. That autumn, the master passed through Xieyou Ridge in West Mountain, where he encountered the Perfected Lord of the Grotto-Heaven, Master Hu. The latter revealed his name, and the master bowed and asked, “Why has the Heavenly Master come here?” He replied, “The Dragon Sands have arisen, and the Great Teaching of Pure Brightness is about to flourish. Eight hundred disciples will emerge, and you shall be their master.” On the *gengshen* day of the twelfth month in the *bingshen* year (1336), the Perfected Lord descended upon the master’s home. The master had encountered He Zhen’gong at midnight, and thus the deity came to inform him. With these words, he vanished. The master rejoiced inwardly.

The following spring, the master again encountered him at the Forbidden Mountains of Yulong, and immediately bowed in reverence. Master Hu said, “I have come once more to convey the decree of the Perfected Lord. You must seek out Wujing Plain in Huangtang Mountain within West Mountain and establish the Jade Perfection Altar there as your retreat. Know that the Perfected Lord is none other than the incarnation of the Supreme Solar Lord. The immortal traditions speak of a golden phoenix bearing a pearl in a dream as the sign of his birth—this is not so. Rather, he is the essence of the golden crow of the sun, which in heaven becomes *qi* and on earth takes form. When the primordial chaos first parted, he descended into the Great Well, then entered the treasury of the sea. When the Perfected Lord was born into the world, he emerged from the ruins of Fusang, passed through the summit of Kunlun, traversed the wind-wheel and watery abyss, journeyed through the earth, and rose from the well of Hongya to align with the *qi* of West Mountain—thus the place is named Wujing Plain.

The Sun and Moon Lords were recorded as witnesses to the Perfected Lord, serving as proof for the transmission of the Dao to later generations. Wherever he dwells, the myriad spirits guard him, and his comings and goings, his transformations, are not subject to mortal power. The Perfected Lord descended in the year *jiwei* of the Red Crow era of the Wu kingdom (239 CE), on the twenty-eighth day of the first month, a *wuwu* day. *Jiwei* is fire; in the celestial reckoning, the first *wuwu* of the epoch signifies the Supreme Sun, while the second *jiwei* signifies the transformation of its residual *qi*. The first month marks the beginning of the human path in the *yin* sign, and the twenty-eighth day signifies the near-darkness before the return of light. Heaven thus inaugurated the immortal destiny, and the year matched the Red Crow. Later, when the Lord of Haihun slew the serpent, a red crow flew past—this too was an omen. Now, as the immortal destiny nears its completion, Wujing has manifested. In the year of the Green Ram, on the first day of the first lunar month in the Purple Clarity Palace, you shall establish the Hall of Tranquil Repose, and the Great Teaching will flourish.”

He then discoursed on the principles of Pure Brightness, and after some time, they parted. When the master emerged from the mountains, two days had already passed.

From this point onward, the Master redoubled his diligence. In the village of Filial Conduct, he established the Ascendant Dao Abbey to propagate the virtuous Way, and his reputation spread far and wide. Many near and far, drawn by admiration, came to follow and study under him.

On the *jiazi* day of the eleventh lunar month in the year *jiawu*, he encountered the Immortal Earl Guo of the Water Palace, who taught him the arts of "weaving mountains and warping waters." He then journeyed to Huangtang Mountain and the Wujing Plain in search of traces, where he indeed found the former dwelling of the Wei Daoist—a place where the Perfected Lord had once cultivated the Dao, and where Master Hongya Zhang had once secluded himself, a site under the jurisdiction of Purple Clarity. He exchanged fields for the land and settled there, building his residence. The Divine Official Deng sent him a poem that read: *"Seeking Hongya’s old traces, / The prophecy meets in the pines and sands."* This referred to the very place.

On the *jiayin* day of the first lunar month in the year *jimao* of the Yuanzhen era, the Master’s spirit journeyed to the Jade Perfection Palace, where he encountered the Perfected Lord along with Masters Zhang and Hu. Upon their return from the Jade Perfection Court, the Master paid his respects. The Perfected Lord instructed him to seek the Yang Crow, and Master Zhang produced from his sleeve a three-legged crow to show him.

On the *gengshen* day of the Upper Prime, the Master went to Purple Clarity, where he ascended the Hong Tower with his disciples Wang Zhen Ding and Fang Gong Cheng. They burned incense and prayed in silence. Suddenly, they detected the pungent scent of sulfur, and as they leaned against the railing in anticipation, a streak of flying light plummeted into the censer. Looking down, they found the Wujing stone within. It was as large as a coconut, neither iron nor stone, but black, lustrous, heavy, and dense. The Master took it and stored it away.

That very night, Master Hu imparted to him the Great Dao, foretelling that by the end of the following year, he would return to Purple Clarity. There, he informed his disciples that the Perfected Lord would descend and arranged for them to await his arrival together. On the *gengshen* day of the twelfth lunar month, Wang Zhen Ding, Fang Gong Cheng, Hu Ci You, and others gathered at the Master’s residence. The Master said, “There is one whose karmic affinity is profound; he will arrive unsummoned.” That evening, as a great snowstorm raged, at the first watch, Huang Yuan Ji of the Yulong Palace suddenly appeared. The Master asked, “The night is cold, the year is late—why have you come from afar?” Huang Yuan Ji replied, “Last night, I dreamed that Celestial Master Hu told me, ‘There is a grand event at Liu Yuzhen’s home; you must go at once.’ So I have come.”

Thereupon, the Master and his disciples lit torches and burned incense, awaiting with utmost sincerity. As the night approached its midpoint, the Master gazed into the empty sky. In an instant, the Perfected Lord arrived. Hastily, he led his disciples down the steps to welcome and bow. A yellow *qi* suffused the air, neither smoke nor mist, escorting them as they ascended the hall. There, the Perfected Lord bestowed the *Records of the Jade Perfection Numinous Treasure Altar*, the paper’s end inscribed: *“Disciple Liu Yuzhen, on the first day of the first lunar month in the year *dingyou*, ascended the mountain peak to receive the Supreme Dao.”* Soon after, the radiant scene dispersed.

Later, Earl Guo imparted to him the altar memorials. On New Year’s Eve, amid cold snow and gloom, the Master purified himself and waited. Past midnight, the doors of the mountain hall opened, and an armored divine figure appeared before him, saying, “The Perfected Lord summons you.” Taking up a lantern, he climbed upward, gazing at the stars, which shone brightly above. After a while, the immortal chariot descended. The Master paid homage and presented cypress leaves, jujubes, and tangerines. The Perfected Lord declared, “This mountain faces Luan Ridge in front and rests upon Crane Peak behind. When I cultivated the Dao here, I paid homage to the Most High. The Most High commanded the Lords of the Sun and Moon to descend here and bestow upon me the Supreme Dao—this is called the Numinous Treasure Altar of Heavenly Audience. Now, I shall transmit to you the *Eight Poles True Canon of the Central Yellow Great Dao*. Receive it with reverence. Among my eight hundred disciples, you are the foremost. Your names have long been inscribed in the Eight Hundred Grotto-Heavens of the Flowery Forest, carved in azure jade and displayed upon the cinnabar cliffs. You must further exhort your disciples: do not deceive the Lord of the Heart, do not harm life and nature, hold loyalty and filial piety in your heart, and aid beings with expedient means. When your merit is complete and your fruits fulfilled, we shall all gather in the grotto—how joyous this will be! Beyond this, devote yourself wholeheartedly to the teachings. As you cultivate and accumulate, each shall receive their due reward and never sink into perdition. But if one begins with diligence and ends in sloth, they shall face the trials of the Wind Blade. You, now expanding the teachings and accumulating merit, shall refine and dissolve the dregs of *yin* over three lifetimes, ascending at dawn into the white sun, no different from me. Strive on, strive on!”

With these words, the Perfected Lord rose high. The Master bowed in farewell, gazing until he vanished from sight before returning.

On the *jiawu* day of the tenth lunar month, he lodged at the Pure and Secluded Hall of Yulong Palace. On the *bingshen* day, Master Hu returned to transmit further Daoist methods, expounding on the principles of the *Three-Five Flying Steps* and the *Orthodox Unity’s Slaying of Demons*. From this point, he unfolded and propagated the Great Teaching, instructing later generations. His methods took loyalty and filial piety as their foundation, revering Heaven and honoring the Dao, with the salvation of the living and deliverance of the dead as their purpose—simple and unburdensome.

Disciples asked, “In the past, what Perfected Lord He transmitted was somewhat elaborate. Now, what you, Master, bestow is extremely concise. Why the difference?” The Master replied, “In the Shaoxing era, the immortal destiny was distant, and the teachings were temporarily adapted to save the world, so the methods were elaborate. Now, the Dragon Sands have arisen, and the immortal destiny draws near. The urgency to deliver beings demands that the teachings be vast in Dao, hence concise. This is the reason for the difference, yet their essence is one—there is no need for doubt.”

He then said to them, “By fortunate karmic causes, we have encountered the Great Teaching—our joy is beyond words. Now that the Hall of Tranquil Repose is roughly prepared, let us first offer the *Hua Feng* felicitations to express our loyalty, and next extend our reverence for ancestors to manifest our filial piety. Cultivate yourselves, act with caution, plant virtue, and practice the Dao—then you shall have no cause for shame. Today, I shall earnestly petition the Perfected Lord to descend the essences of the sun and moon to refine and deliver our departed ancestors, freeing them from karmic burdens in the netherworld.”

On the *jian* day of the tenth lunar month, they ascended the Altar of Heavenly Audience. Spreading incense and presenting memorials, they sat upon the ground in meditative absorption, placing two earthen vessels upon the altar. Suddenly, two streaks of flying light, like golden threads, descended from the heavens into the vessels—one on the left, a liquid like cinnabar; the other on the right, a fluid like mercury. These were used to inscribe talismans, and when the task was complete, nothing remained.

Seven days later, the disciples all dreamed of their departed ancestors, who declared their gratitude for the Perfected Lord’s deliverance—refined and recast, they had turned from yin to yang and ascended the ranks of immortality.

The following year, on the *gengshen* day of the tenth lunar month, Master Guo returned and imparted further teachings, while Master Deng frequently visited to discourse on the *Book of Changes*, deepening the Master’s profound understanding of it. Lord Fang Gongcheng once remarked on hexagrams and images, when at midnight a gust extinguished the candle. The Master exhaled gently, and the flame rekindled. Astonished, Gongcheng asked how this was possible. The Master replied calmly: “You speak of the *Book of Changes* on paper, yet know nothing of the *Book of Changes* within yourself. Had you understood, what was extinguished could be made bright again—what is there to marvel at?” Gongcheng bowed deeply and begged to become his disciple.

In daily life, the Master often conversed with immortals, among whom Zhang, Hu, Guo, and Deng were closest. Master Zhang once summoned him to Hongjing, where he cast a fan into the water and commanded him to cross afloat. He also bestowed the formula for the Elixir of As-You-Will, instructing him to gather the *shi pu* from Hongjing’s stones to prepare medicine for the sick. Master Guo once led him to the Water Palace, where he saw a massive green monkey bound at the gate. Pointing, Guo said, “This is the spirit Wu Zhiqi, whom the Great Yu imprisoned.”

Though the Master’s Daoist practice flourished daily, he grew ever more reticent, yet whenever he performed prayers or exorcisms for others, his methods were unfailingly extraordinary. The Hidden Truth Hermitage and the Pure Quiet Retreat were built in succession, and esoteric teachings of all kinds were transmitted in turn.

On the *dingmao* day of the first lunar month in the year of *wushen*, he cast a piece of black crystal into Hongjing, saying, “Only one burdened with weighty karmic ties shall retrieve it.” He then entrusted the mission of propagating the teachings to Huang Yuanji, declaring: “I came in this life to initiate the Great Teaching. In a future incarnation, I shall return with eight hundred disciples. Now, as the yang numbers near their end, after my passing, cremate my remains at night and inter my bones on Zhaoxian Plain. In three years, move them to an island in the sea.”

On the *guisi* day of the second lunar month, he bid farewell at Purple Clarity Palace and Emerald Rock Temple. On *jiayin*, he fell ill, and all his disciples gathered. On *bingshen*, he rose at dawn, sat upright on his couch, and at noon, raised his hands in a bow. Then, lying down beside the couch, he passed away at the age of fifty-two. His disciples followed his final instructions for his funeral. Three years later, when his tomb was opened, only an empty casket remained.

The Master’s learning was rooted in rectifying the heart and sincerity of intent, manifesting in true practice and steadfast conduct. He neither affected loftiness nor feigned compliance, spoke no falsehoods nor indulged in idle words—every utterance pertained to heavenly principles and worldly teachings. He comprehended the essence of the Three Teachings with perfect clarity, yet took the teachings of Laozi as his foundation. His works include *The Jade Truth Record* and *The Pure and Bright Esoteric Principles*, totaling one hundred thirty-seven chapters.

**Epitaph for Master Zhonghuang**

Master Huang Yuanji, styled Xiwen, hailed from a distinguished family of Fengcheng in Yuzhang. At twelve, he entered Jade Prosperity Longevity Palace and served Master Zhu of the Pure Transcendence Hall. After Zhu’s passing, his master, Master Wang Yuehang, cherished and instructed him. Master Wang was stern, pure, and frugal, embodying the spirit of the ancients. Skilled in medicine, he amassed provisions through healing, then shut his door to all who sought treatment. Xiwen begged to learn his craft as a livelihood, but Wang refused, saying: “It is not that I withhold from you. Medicine is profoundly subtle—if one’s judgment or foresight falters even slightly, a life may be lost through one’s error. It is no trivial matter. I do not wish to profit from it; I have abandoned this path simply to minimize my faults. I fear it would burden you—better to seek tranquility and cultivate your own attainment.”

After Master Wang’s death, in the western mountains there appeared a certain Master Liu Yuzhen, a retired scholar of upright conduct who dwelled in seclusion. Through divine encounters, he declared: “The millennium prophecy of Lord Xu of Jingyang at Longsha has come to pass, and I am the foremost of eight hundred immortals.” He held Xiwen in special regard, believing him worthy of trust, and at his passing, entrusted the transmission to him. His teachings emphasized the purity and clarity of the original heart, with conduct necessarily prizing loyalty and filial piety above all.

Xiwen served Master Liu as a father and his wife as a mother. Even when far away, he would first offer prayers before eating or drinking. He revered his master’s words as if standing before heaven, earth, and the spirits. Then, on the mountain, he selected a site to establish the Jade Truth Hermitage and the Hidden Truth and Pure Quiet altars, where he instructed his disciples.

In the third year of the *Zhizhi* era, he journeyed to the capital with his teachings. Ministers, high officials, and scholars all paid him respect, and none failed to marvel at him. The following year, when the era name was changed to *Taiding*, the thirty-ninth Celestial Master of the Han succession, Zhang, came to the capital. Court officials recommended Xiwen, saying: “Master Zhonghuang is steadfast and resolute, skilled in governance and decisive action. Once, when overseeing his temple as superintendent, he enforced strict discipline—some were displeased, yet the fields and buildings flourished, and all was accomplished for the public good. Those who once opposed him later became his staunchest admirers. After receiving the teachings of loyalty and filial piety from Master Yuzhen, he humbled himself, embracing simplicity and becoming a man of profound insight. Eminent figures now seek his counsel—he should be honored accordingly.”

Thus, an edict was issued appointing Xiwen as the *Pure and Bright Venerable Daoist Master, Eminent Scholar of the Teaching*. When Jade Prosperity Longevity Palace burned, the planned reconstruction had not yet begun. The Grand Master of the Mysterious Teachings retained him at August Truth Longevity Palace. After a year, intending to submit his name to the throne and present the imperial letter of appointment, Xiwen remained aloof, dwelling in seclusion, devoted solely to elucidating his master’s teachings. There was a saying about him: *“Day by day, the turbid is cleansed, and purity approaches.”* He had nearly attained this state.

On the eleventh day of the twelfth lunar month, he wrote a letter to bid farewell to his disciples, Chen Tianhe and others, instructing his attendants: “At midnight tonight, my time will come.” When the attendants relayed this, Xiwen said: “I return to the realm of Jade Truth.”

The following day, he instructed his attendants to purify his bones with fire outside the eastern gate of the city, saying: “When the firewood is consumed and the flames extinguished, if a wind comes from the south, that shall be my sign to you.” And so it came to pass. His attendants carried his remaining sword, intending to return and enshrine it in the Western Mountains.

Xiwen lived in the world for fifty-five years, serving as a Daoist priest for forty. He ordained disciples such as Chen Tianhe, Liu Zhenchuan, Xiong Xuanhui, Liu Sifu, and Huang Tongli, and taught the Way of Purity and Brightness, Loyalty and Filial Piety to countless followers whose names cannot all be recorded. Master Zhao of Zhongshan, a man of the Dao, once came with Xiwen and said to him: “Compose an inscription for me, and I shall keep it.” Out of respect for Master Zhao’s request, he therefore wrote this inscription:

*In the ancient immortal abode of the Western Mountains’ ruins,*
*Strange traces lie hidden—five hundred years twice over.*
*The radiance of yang essence shines forth, manifesting numinous power;*
*I receive the scripture and carry on the mysterious virtue.*
*To attain long life and immortality as a model for the world—*
*Yet suddenly he departs, his going unfathomable.*
*With the resonance of bronze and the elegance of jade,*
*He marks his return to the true earth, filling the boundless.*

**Facts of the Daoist Danjiong**
Danjiong’s surname was Xu, his given name Yi, also called Hui, and his courtesy name Ziqi. He was born on the twenty-seventh day of the eighth lunar month in the *xinyou* year of the Zhiyuan era (1291), at the hour of *yin*. He married a woman of the Liu clan, who bore him a son, Shijin. His ancestors were a prominent family of Fengcheng, who had served in Luling and thus settled there.

His great-grandfather, the Master of Yugu, was a paragon of refined erudition. In the examination halls of the former Song, he had earned renown, yet both his sons died young.

Ziqi, orphaned in childhood, was precociously gifted. Ashamed to befriend common boys, he shut himself away to read, sitting upright all day. Master Yangwu Liu, the principal heir of the Xuxi lineage, was then hailed as the arbiter of literary judgment—those he approved were said to have "ascended the dragon gate." On the first day of the eighth month, Ziqi once accompanied his great-grandfather to pay respects. At their first meeting, Master Liu asked what he had studied, then immediately assigned a poetic theme. Ziqi took up his brush and composed on the spot. The master was deeply impressed, exclaiming in admiration. Recalling Du Fu’s line about the "two extraordinary sons of Minister Xu," he bestowed upon him the courtesy name Ziqi. Moreover, he prefaced Ziqi’s poetry collection, praising his *wuyan* verses for their lofty, serene, and unadorned style, closely approaching the ancient spirit. Even his *jinti* poems, he noted, were transformed into flowing elegance—all owing to his innate brilliance and learning. The depth of his commendation was thus abundantly clear.

In the spring of the *wuwu* year (1318), Ziqi journeyed to the capital, where his literary talents first gained recognition from Censor Li Yifei, Director of the Bureau of Ritual Implements Ma Jiu’gao, Right Chancellor Qifeng, and Grand Councilor Dacidu. Thereafter, he was received with courtesy by many eminent officials in the imperial court. In the spring of the *guihai* year (1323), Emperor Yingzong issued an edict to examine candidates for the *Jin Jing Shi* (Golden Script Examination). Hundreds of scholars from the Hanlin Academy participated, and Ziqi ranked among the foremost. Soon after, however, the examination was suspended.

Hearing that Master Zhonghuang had attained the Dao of Supreme Clarity and Purity and resided at Chongzhen Abbey, Ziqi went to study under him. At their first meeting, Master Zhonghuang remarked, "I dreamed of you last night. Now you have come—it seems we share a predestined bond. You shall propagate my teachings." From then on, Ziqi mastered the eightfold mysteries of Zhonghuang’s doctrine. He also studied under Master Lan at Changchun Abbey, receiving the essence of the Quanzhen School’s non-action teachings. He was granted the title *Master of Supreme Clarity, Dao-Aligned, Spirit-Manifesting, and Model of Efficacy*. Thereafter, worldly rank no longer stirred his heart. Though high officials of the court vied to recruit him, he remained unmoved.

In the spring of the *jiazi* year (1324), he returned home due to his mother’s advanced age, resolving to care for her with utmost devotion. He attended to her with gentle demeanor, delighting and obeying her in every way, sparing no effort. This devotion continued for over twenty years until her passing, after which he observed all funeral rites with perfect propriety. When he first returned, his household was struck by an epidemic. Some advised against entering, but Ziqi replied, "How could I stand at the gate and not ascend the hall to pay respects to my mother?" He returned regardless. The so-called spirits and malign influences dispersed at once, as if no illness had ever been present. Had his Dao not been profound and his virtue weighty, how could such swift dissolution have occurred?

That year, a severe drought afflicted the region. The villagers entreated him to pray at the Jian Bridge in the village, where he performed rites to summon rain. From then on, his disciples multiplied, and those who sought his teachings were all men of exceptional literary talent. Even elders in their sixties and seventies willingly followed him, declaring, "Our master embodies the Dao."

Ziqi was magnanimous, prizing integrity and generosity, and steadfast in his promises. He guided his students in discerning the profound mysteries, exhausting the depths of his knowledge like a river pouring forth. For decades, within a thousand *li*, whenever droughts, floods, or famines struck, he would answer prayers and go forth. Divine responses followed, thunder and lightning answered his call, and he transformed parched lands into years of plenty, dispelled lingering gloom into clear skies—countless were such miracles. When illness struck, whether among scholars or commoners, whether malarial fevers, the wails of swine-demons, or the hauntings of tree-spirits, a single flight of his talismanic script would banish all malevolent forces. Such occurrences were too numerous to record.

His unceasing self-cultivation and steadfast discipline caused his radiance to shine forth, naturally manifesting inner virtue in outward form. Scholars and gentlemen often referred to him as Master Qifeng or the Daoist of the Vermilion Portal. His chamber was named for its purity, clarity, and luminosity, inscribed with the characters *Danjiong* (Vermilion Portal). Duke Zhang of Liu left a record of this. His poetry collection, titled *Cup of Water, Jade Clouds*, was prefaced by Duke Teng. The *Pure and Bright* texts on loyalty and filial piety that he transmitted were first printed and circulated. His handwritten ritual texts, refined and elegant, comprised several volumes passed down to the world.

In the spring of the *gengyin* year (1350), he sent a poem to his wife, the nun Shi Fu Luo Wenkui:
*I recall the long corridor where we listened to the rain,*
*Your golden brush inscribing black silk lines.*
*A hundred years like a dream—I awoke first;*
*Ten thousand affairs like clouds—you still cling to folly.*
*Old friends in heaven grow old in heaven;*
*Rustics in the village play in the village.*
*Facing the wind, I convey my earnest thoughts—*
*Old and infirm, with no talent, I’ve grown lazy at verse.*

He also sent a poem to the emissary Sheng Ximing:
*Once, the wind and rain filled our thoughts,*
*Ten years have passed in a blink.*
*Though a thousand mountains divide us,*
*Could there be no letters between us?*
*Retirement is my lot—what of it?*
*Wealth and rank easily sever ties.*
*Cherish the learning of a lifetime,*
*And let the winds and clouds unfold your grand design.*

Another poem, bidding farewell to his disciple Zhong Yanwen:
*This year marks a full cycle of sixty,*
*Content with my lot, what more could I seek?*
*In dreams, the pond’s grass revives my brush;*
*Chanting, the river’s plum blossoms fill the moonlit tower.*
*Life’s count begins anew today;*
*An old heart cannot match youth’s wanderings.*
*The elixir refined, my body light as a leaf,*
*I’ll roam the grotto heavens and famed mountains at will.*

He also composed a self-eulogy for his portrait:
*In life, I am you; in death, you are me.*
*Between these two, who has ever known the true I?*
*Humph!*
*The moon’s orb was never in the heart of the waves;*
*All the seas and lakes are equally its home.*

On the fifteenth day of the fifth month, he instructed his disciple Xiao Shangxian to express gratitude to the immortal generals and officers on his behalf, and to prepare a farewell feast to summon fellow villagers and friends. Addressing the assembled guests, he said: *"Heavenly fragrance encircles the house, the family prosperous and flourishing; the jade palace’s foundation is laid for an official’s illustrious ascent."*

At noon the following day, he asked for paper and brush to leave behind a verse:
*This foul bag of skin,*
*Cast aside—no hindrance remains.*
*Within the crimson furnace’s blazing flames,*
*Beyond, the bright moon and clear wind.*

He tossed the brush aside, sat upright, and jade-like tears streamed from his nose a foot long. After a time, they looked again—he had departed. His form had remained in the world for sixty years, and he had guided hundreds of disciples.

**Records of the Jade True Numinous Treasure Altar**
*By Xu Xun*

The numinous essence of Zhongling converges in great treasure upon the Western Mountains. These Western Mountains gather the vital *qi* of past and present, serving as the grand abode of immortals above and below. Those of the Dao invariably emerge from here. Since I received the Supreme Lord’s Pure Brightness, my companions—Zhang Hongya, Hu Basu, and others—have been among them. The prophecies of Longsha and the records of Songsha all pertain to the secret numinous treasures of these Western Mountains.

Before, the phoenix soared; after, the crane stood sentinel. The dark crystal was established, and the immortal lineage continued. What is this numinous essence? It first bore the name of Primordial Simplicity. At the utmost refinement of essence, the Numinous Treasure manifests its form—thus, this treasure is numinous. In heaven, it is the Yellow Center; on earth, the Dark Crystal; in humans, the Cinnabar Gate.

Only when treasured does it become numinous; without treasure, it remains inert. Those of the Dao who treasure this numinosity will naturally ascend through layered pavilions, perceive the inner landscape of the Yellow Court, and with the "Three-Five Flying Steps," their spirits will ascend to the Jade Capital. They will align with a thousand years of auspicious fortune and fulfill the eight hundred immortal allotments—riding cranes to the Jade Palace, boiling phoenixes in the Jasper Pool. Compared to such treasures, the jewels of the mortal world are but tiles and pebbles between heaven and earth.

I have a disciple, Jade True One, who received my recorded instructions and came to seek the old traces. He treasures this numinosity and awakens the essence of the crystal. Among the eight hundred hosts of perfected beings, the first is Jade True, the second Hidden True, and the third Cavern True. Numinous True and Treasure True—one true essence, myriad true manifestations. When true essences gather spirit, the golden crow births numinosity; when the Numinous Treasure gathers essence, the jade hare births form.

Heaven bestows this Dao; earth raises this treasure. Cherish and enact it, and heaven and earth become one. Lead these hosts of perfected beings to continue my legacy. Those of the Dao, unburdened by worldly entanglements, must aid in this endeavor—slaying serpents and beheading whales. Though the cosmos be exhausted, their merit surpasses the Jade Clarity Heaven—how magnificent!

Thus, I strike the stone and inscribe this eulogy:
*The golden crow flows with crystal,*
*The vast well mirrors its form.*
*Zhongling gathers the numinous,*
*Longsha crowns its heroes.*
*Eight hundred, eight hundred—*
*The Numinous Treasure is attained.*
*Jade True conceals virtue,*
*And establishes this abode.*

**The Pure Brightness Great Dao Explained**
*By Hu Huasu*

Pure Brightness is the formless Great Dao, the primordial root of precelestial origin. Above, it is the Supreme Clarity and Emptiness; in heaven, the Central Yellow Eight; in humans, the Cinnabar Origin and Crimson Palace. These three emerge from the same source but bear different names, all called the Mysterious. Mysterious upon mysterious—the gateway to all wonders.

To understand this principle is Pure Brightness. Clarity is purity; emptiness is brightness. The realm of Supreme Clarity and Emptiness is called Pure Brightness. The Central Yellow Eight is the heart of heaven; the Cinnabar Origin and Crimson Palace are the heart of humans. Thus, heaven establishes the Central Yellow Eight to repay the primordial root, and humans should practice loyalty and filial piety to reciprocate the grace of ruler and parents.

Loyalty and filial piety are the foundation of the Great Dao. Therefore, the noble person devotes himself to the root, and once the root is established, the Dao arises. Are not filial piety and fraternal duty the root of benevolence? Those who neglect the root to pursue cultivation are like master craftsmen without timber—what can their skill achieve?

Only figures like Great Shun and Bi Gan, who did not cultivate but devoted themselves to loyalty and filial piety, who did not seek the Dao yet found it complete within themselves. Below, even jackals and wolves know father and son, ants know ruler and minister. If even creatures uphold loyalty and filial piety, how much more should humans? How much more should disciples of the Dao?

The Pure Brightness Great Dao shares the same principle and source, though its forms differ. The same principle means none can depart without passing through this gate—why not follow this Dao? The same source with different forms means the Dao generates the One, the One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three, and the Three generate the myriad things. Among the myriad things, humans are the most noble. Those who are neither loyal nor filial—are they not inferior to jackals, wolves, and ants? Those who cannot achieve Pure Brightness—are they not inferior to dung beetles sipping dew?

Even creatures embody the essence of loyalty, filial piety, and the Great Dao—how could disciples of the Dao be unaware? I, following the Supreme Lord, have established the gate of the Great Dao of Loyalty and Filial Piety. It is easy to understand and easy to practice—strive to propagate it. Humans can magnify the Dao, not the Dao magnify humans. The key lies not in meditating on Chan or inquiring into the Dao, nor in entering mountains to refine form, but in establishing loyalty and filial piety as the root and purifying the heart’s square inch. With the Four Virtues complete, the spirit gradually becomes numinous. Without cultivation, the Dao is naturally achieved—believe these words.

Until Pure Brightness.

**The Pure Brightness Dao and Methods Explained**
*By Hu Huasu*

The formless Great Dao of the Limitless generates the One; the One generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams—called the Central Yellow Eight Poles and Nine Palaces. The Dao is established in the Central Yellow, and its methods spread to the Eight Poles. One yin and one yang, one movement and one stillness—these are the outer and inner of each other.

The true Dao lies within; its methods govern the external. One rectifies the inner, and the Eight govern the outer—thus, heaven is clear and earth is tranquil.

Explanation:
The Limitless and Empty is called Pure Brightness; the Dao within it is the Central Yellow. Its methods spread to the Eight Directions as the Eight Poles, converging the Four Images and paying homage to the Three Heavens—called the "Three-Five Flying Steps." Rectify the inner and govern the outer—called "Orthodox Unity Slaying Demons." Disciples who wish to govern the external must first rectify the inner.

To rectify the inner, first eliminate desire.
Without desire, the heart naturally unifies in rectitude;
with the heart rectified, the methods of the Dao are complete.

*Pure Brightness Teachings*
**Recorded by Guo Pu**

The Limitless becomes the Supreme Ultimate;
the Limitless is called Pure Brightness.
The scripture states:
*"Nameless, it is the origin of heaven and earth;
named, it is the mother of the myriad things."*
Thus, from the Supreme Ultimate’s division, the Two Modes arise,
and humanity is born.
Among all things between heaven and earth, humans are the most refined—
hence, together with heaven and earth, they are called the "Three Powers."

Thereafter, heaven and earth take *fondness for life* as their heart,
so humans embody the heart of heaven and earth as their own.
In the era before heaven, the human heart was one with heaven and earth,
pure, still, and without action.
From the middle era onward,
the nameless could not endure,
and the unmanifest could not remain hidden in the manifest—
yet the teachings of Pure Brightness had not yet wholly vanished.
After the era of heaven,
those who acted multiplied endlessly,
diverging from the *"nameless origin of heaven and earth."*

The Most High, upholding the virtue of *fondness for life*,
pitied the unevenness of human existence
and could not but reveal its methods and establish teachings.
Now, *method* is discipline.
Discipline the unvirtuous to return to virtue,
discipline the unbenevolent to return to benevolence,
discipline the disloyal and unfilial to return to loyalty and filial piety.

Pure Brightness was transmitted by the Most High to the Lords of the Sun and Moon,
who bestowed it upon Grand Scribe Xu.
Grand Scribe Xu once more proclaimed and disseminated it.
All disciples of this method,
having accumulated great deeds,
encounter this supreme teaching—
they must uphold its discipline without fail,
revering it as the divine,
fearing it as thunder,
and practicing it with devotion.
Turn from the era of heaven back to the era before heaven,
restore the named to the nameless.
It is like the sun and moon emerging from darkness into light,
heaven and earth passing from night to dawn,
the four seasons shifting from winter to spring—
the Dao abides within.
The teachings of Pure Brightness circulate throughout the Eight Wastelands.

Though Grand Scribe Xu’s Dao was revered and his virtue esteemed,
his merit covering the Nine Provinces,
our disciples,
having perfected their deeds and fulfilled their conduct,
penetrate the Jade Perfection of the Hidden,
embody the Pure Brightness in full—
without action, they are one.

*Establishing the Altar Memorial*
**Composed by Guo Pu**

Heavenly spirits and earthly treasures complete,
the Great Dao conceals the Jade Perfection.
Its arising is nameless;
its manifestation follows number.
Now, on Yellow Hall Mountain,
an altar is established to serve the Dao,
praying for the nation’s longevity
and repaying parental kindness—
thus, the Dao abides within.

The Immortal Lord established the record and inscription;
I have composed this memorial in full.
The memorial states:

The Dragon Sands prophecy speaks of eight hundred immortals,
originating from the Jade Perfection.
Three thousand radiant scenes of dark crystal,
within which the Numinous Treasure is concealed.
As the qi-cycles turn in their course,
an altar ground is established.
It requires the White Water True Person
and all great masters to follow in succession.
Soon, the Recluse of Yellow Mountain
will achieve singular merit.
With cassia incense and fragrant names,
this very day they are inscribed in the Jade Treasury.
When the ripened peaches of the immortal tree bloom,
in another time they shall feast together in the Jasper Palace.

*The Complete Book of Purity, Brightness, Loyalty, and Filial Piety, Scroll Three*
*Compiled by Huang Yuanji, Dharma Master of the Purity and Brightness Transmission*
*Collated by Lineage Disciple Xu Hui*

From the *Inner Collection of the Jade Perfection Master’s Recorded Sayings*:

Someone asked: Among the many Dharma gates of past and present, why is this teaching uniquely named *Purity, Brightness, Loyalty, and Filial Piety*?

The Master said: There is no other reason.
*Purity and Brightness* simply mean rectifying the mind and making the will sincere.
*Loyalty and Filial Piety* simply mean upholding the moral order.
Yet worldly scholars, though they hear these words often, grow numb to them and let them slip by—here, we emphasize true practice and real conduct.

The Master said: *Great loyalty* means deceiving nothing.
*Great filial piety* means loving all as one body.

The Master said: What is *purity*? Not being stained by things.
What is *brightness*? Not being obstructed by things.
When one is neither stained nor obstructed, loyalty and filial piety arise naturally.

Again, he said: *Loyalty* means loyalty to the ruler.
The mind-ruler governs the myriad spirits; a single deceitful thought is already disloyalty.

The Master said: When a child serves their parents, those who claim to have exhausted their efforts have not yet succeeded.
One must cultivate a single thought of filial piety that can win the heart’s approval of their parents—then the heart of Heaven will also approve.
Only then can it be called *filial devotion that reaches Heaven*.

Someone asked: As the ages grow distant and texts proliferate, those of shallow learning cannot grasp the essentials.
In the Purity and Brightness teaching, what are the key points of the learning of rectifying the mind and cultivating the self, the way of true loyalty and utmost filial piety? I beg you to illustrate with a few words.

The Master said: Since my early years of cultivation, I have practiced and embodied thirty characters. Over time, I have found them profoundly effective. Now I offer them to you.
These thirty characters are: *Curb anger, restrain desire, clarify principle without obscurity. If the mind-sky deviates even slightly, one incurs the fault of darkness. A moment’s wayward speech must violate the empty prohibition.*

Someone asked: May I hear the details?

The Master said: The nature of humanity is originally luminous, communing with Heaven above.
But suffering the gradual stains of many lives—indulging anger, yielding to desire, distorting principle—one fails to walk the human Way. How then can one match Heaven and Earth and be called one of the Three Powers?

What is *anger*? It is not merely rage or resentment.
Any trace of jealousy, pettiness, narrowness, or inability to tolerate others—taking sharp scrutiny for wisdom, refusing to let go of the slightest thing—all belong to anger.
If one can deeply curb and sternly guard against it, expanding the breadth of one’s mind, the fire of wrath will naturally not flare upward.

What is *desire*? It is not merely lust or sensual craving.
Any attachment to affection, clinging, or fixation on things—such as coveting an object, entangling the mind-root, and refusing to let go—all belong to desire.
If one can block its source (the initial stirrings of attachment), remain vigilant, and act with clarity, the waters of desire will naturally not flow downward.

Yet within this, one must *clarify principle*—that is, not obscure the mind-sky.
The mind contains Heaven; that is principle.
For example, if one can revere and love their parents, this is not obscuring principle—it is not forgetting one’s origin, knowing one’s root.
To stand between Heaven and Earth, born with hair and teeth, yet from youth to old age never love, respect, or serve one’s parents—what is this if not madness or loss of mind?
The same applies to not recognizing one’s ruler, not acknowledging one’s teacher, failing to befriend one’s brothers, or neglecting trust and righteousness in friendships.
Beyond this, any action driven by self-interest, disregarding principle, is called *obscuring the mind-sky*.
When the mind-sky is obscured, it is like a bright mirror suddenly smeared with dust and ink.
All such accumulations, over a lifetime, blind one to their original spirit, shrouding it in darkness.
Thus, at the moment of death, one falls into the long night of the underworld, suffering endless torments with no hope of escape.

Observing the world, those who indulge anger burn their harmony and harm themselves.
Those who indulge desire sink and defile their spirit.
Those who distort principle weaken their original spirit day by day and dissipate their fortune and virtue—yet they remain unaware.
If one can suddenly awaken and reform from this very day:
Curbing anger causes the heart-fire to descend;
restraining desire causes the kidney-water to rise;
clarifying principle without obscuring the mind-sky strengthens the original spirit day by day and increases fortune and virtue.
With water above and fire below, the spirit is harmonized, and at the center, true earth serves as the master.
*True earth* is the principle of luminous central yellow.
This alone is the learning of rectifying the mind and cultivating the self, the way of true loyalty and utmost filial piety.
With prolonged practice, one restores the original purity and luminosity of one’s nature—the Dao resides herein.

The latter twenty characters are the *Celestial Precepts of the Stone Drum of Wangwu Mountain*, which are the secret practices of daily conduct.
For instance, in one’s actions, even the slightest deviation from the proper measure subtly diminishes the light of one’s original spirit.
Accumulated over days and months without repentance or reform, the entire being returns to darkness.

Furthermore, in conversation, one must speak only when words are harmless and appropriate.
Even a single word or half-sentence that violates principle—
and there are those who recklessly speak words of ill fortune, uttering them without restraint, unaware that the emptiness itself has divine spirits listening.

The so-called "forbidden obscenities of the void" refer to the *Great Obscene Demon Kings of Flying Heaven* in the *Scripture of Salvation*. Their kind is vast, and the Celestial Emperor has commissioned them to assist the Three Officials in inspecting transgressions. They constantly fly through the void, observing the world below—when profane words are uttered, one violates their prohibitions. This is merely the saying that "heaven hears all from on high," yet those who hear it often dismiss it as common talk. The moment such a thought arises, the speaker’s fortune and virtue dissolve of their own accord. Once fortune and virtue are depleted, calamity follows. All of this is self-invoked. Thus the scripture states: "What one reaps from one’s own deeds, one must bear oneself." From this, we see that every word and deed of a person must be guarded—how much more so for those devoted to the Dao.

The Master said: Most people are ensnared by the fires of anger, the waters of desire, and the lurking tides of self-interest within their bellies, unable to subdue them. These obstruct countless good prospects, yet they remain unaware. If one can subdue them, over time the wonders of true yin-yang and the five phases will naturally reveal themselves, and the Dao will be attained.

The Master said: The Great Teaching of Purity and Luminosity is the most upright and central of all doctrines. It can be practiced throughout the world and for all posterity without flaw. Its essence lies in not deceiving one’s own heart and not harming one’s own life—this is true loyalty and perfect filial piety. Serve one’s parents first, be publicly loyal and upright, and become an exemplary person in the world. Each day, reflect: above, strive to be unashamed before heaven; below, strive to be unabashed before others; within, strive to be blameless in one’s heart. When facing difficult circumstances, address them with a heart illuminated by principle, like the masterful hand of a butcher dissecting an ox—every step must align with heavenly intent. Proceed thus, rising early and retiring late, keeping the thought of loyalty and filial piety in mind. Though others may not know, heaven surely does. Do not vainly seek blessings or rewards; over days and years, your wishes will naturally be fulfilled.

Understand that this teaching is not the domain of those with unkempt hair and filthy faces, mired in stagnant emptiness. Thus the ancients said: "No need to seek seclusion from the world—do not become a criminal against the teachings of proper conduct." They also said: "To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the Dao of humanity." Yet I often see those who claim to study the Dao, who in every moment of the day scheme with their hearts, failing to cast off deceit, perversity, treachery, and duplicity. Though their mouths may speak of yellow sprouts and white snow, black mercury and red lead, in the end, it is all but empty delusion. Thus, of the thousands who study, scarcely one or two succeed—why is this? Simply because they have not first tended to the cultivation of their own minds.

The ancients said: "A thousand falsehoods cannot equal one truth." Know that seeking immortality and studying the Dao is like building a fine house. First, clear the ground of rubble, cut away the brambles, and dig deep to lay a solid foundation. Then erect the pillars, set the beams, complete the roof, and smooth the plaster until the work is flawless and the structure commands admiration. If the brambles are not cleared, the rubble not removed, the foundation not leveled, and the base not secured, yet one attempts to raise pillars and beams, thatch the roof, and plaster the walls, how can it withstand a single day of wind and rain, torrents and floods? It will tilt, collapse, and all effort will be in vain.

It is also like building a stone bridge across a river. First, one must probe to the very bottom, stand on solid ground, then pile wood and stack stones to create a deep foundation. Only then can the bridge surface be laid flat, a shelter built above, ensuring the foundation endures forever. Though raging waves crash and storm winds howl, the bridge remains unshaken, and all marvel at its strength. There is no other secret—only deep roots and a firm footing make it steadfast and enduring. How can one with an impure mind and shallow roots hope to succeed?

Only the Purity and Luminosity Daoist methods of Our Lord of All Immortals, with their thunderous loyalty and filial piety, instantly awaken the original purity and luminosity within the mind, and in the celestial nature of one’s being, practice true loyalty and perfect filial piety. They serve as the sovereign of all spirits and the model for later learners. Conducting oneself without fault, applying the heart with precision, one’s merit becomes complete, virtue esteemed, and the Dao revered. The entire household ascends in flight, enduring for ten thousand years. Looking down upon the world, those who neglect inner cultivation and seek only external gains cannot be spoken of in the same breath. Why is this so?

Every human heart possesses the heavenly principle, yet it remains unrecognized and unacknowledged. As the ancients said: *"Wait until your heart is upright, then the Way will affirm you; only then will you manifest flawless purity."* Reflect carefully—who is upright, who is crooked? Who is true, who is false? My whip cannot be wielded carelessly. Strive, strive!

The Master said: *"All dharmas are empty; only sincerity is real."*

The Master said: *"Heaven establishes the Central Yellow and the Eight Poles to repay the supreme origin."* This means it blocks the yin turbidity of the middle and lower realms, preventing it from surging upward into the pure and empty celestial domain. Within the human body, there is likewise a Central Yellow and Eight Poles, which serve to block the turbid qi of the lower burner, preventing it from steaming the heart’s palace—this is what is called the diaphragm. The worldly qi of disloyalty, unfiliality, resentment, and anger, when rising to the Central Yellow and Eight Poles of Heaven, returns as disasters of flood, drought, and pestilence, each summoned according to the resonance of its qi. This is what is meant by *"misfortune and blessing have no gate; each is self-invoked."*

Only the qi of loyalty and filial piety pierces directly into the pure and empty realm, like an arrow striking its target, even causing malevolent stellar influences to retreat and withdraw.

The Master said: *"In practicing the Daoist methods, one must, in moments of leisure, maintain and guard the upright mind—this is the study of rectifying the heart. When upright, the Dao resides within. If one is not upright yet employs these methods to expel evil, it is like aiding a tyrant in oppression—far from being beneficial, it becomes harmful."*

The Master said: *"The accumulation of good belongs to yang; yang qi rises and floats. The accumulation of evil belongs to yin; yin qi sinks and falls. The stellar constellations in the heavens are the yang qi of humanity. Yet within the Three Realms, there is both good and evil. Even celestial stars, if a single thought is impure, belong to yin, and yin qi naturally descends again to become human. When stars fall and become stones, these are the yin dregs of their descent."*

Someone asked: *"From ancient times, those who sought the Dao and pursued immortality have spoken of 'cultivation and refinement.' Yet in the Teachings of Purity and Luminosity, this is uniquely omitted. Why?"*

The Master said: *"I have only heard Our Lord of All Immortals say that the Great Teaching of Purity and Luminosity is the study of rectifying the heart and cultivating the person—it is not the mundane practice of refining essence and qi as commonly understood. Rectifying the heart and cultivating the person is the work of ordering the heavenly nature and earthly mind. In the most ancient times, when the people lived in unspoiled simplicity, what need was there for ordering? What need for cultivation and refinement? Their words and actions were all in accord with the Dao. It is only because later generations, being increasingly deceitful and cunning, have declined further and further that with every movement and action, they obscure their hearts, sinking into darkness without awareness, reaching every kind of excess. Among those who aspire to the Dao, some do not apply the work of self-discipline to the original ground of the heart but mistakenly take the refinement of essence and qi to be the supreme, everlasting wonder. Thus, the Most High, grieving that this Dao was not understood, descended to instruct the Lords of the Sun and Moon, who disseminated this teaching. The Lords of the Sun and Moon then transmitted it to Our Lord of All Immortals, who insisted that later learners must, through true loyalty and perfect filial piety, return to the realm of original purity and luminosity. There is no refinement more wondrous than this—it is truly the study of restoring antiquity. Thus, the Venerable Celestial Master Hu reiterated: 'The essence lies in establishing loyalty and filial piety as the foundation, with a heart of purity and luminosity. When the Four Virtues are complete, the spirit gradually becomes numinous. Without cultivation and refinement, the Dao is naturally attained.' Believe these words, and you will reach Purity and Luminosity. If one does not believe the words of Our Lord of All Immortals and the Venerable Celestial Master Hu, what words can be believed? Yet the worldly often neglect the work of self-discipline, seeking instead methods of cultivation and refinement. Little do they know that without ordering the heart-ground, to seek flight is like walking backward to move forward. Now that this Dao has been greatly illuminated in the world, those of insight who follow this teaching may advance a thousand miles in a single day. Generally speaking, those who can establish loyalty and filial piety as the foundation, with a heart of purity and luminosity, will find their own heart-heaven and the Central Yellow Dao-qi of the heavens connected in resonance. This mutual response ensures that, in time, they will merge with the Dao as naturally as water flows to the sea. Can one not strive for this?"*

The Master said: *"Heaven has its patterns, earth has its principles, and humans have their affairs—these are the ways of the Three Powers, unchanging from ancient times to the present. The Dao of Purity and Luminosity does not abandon human affairs; one must simply rectify the heart in dealing with things, always responding yet always tranquil."*

Someone asked: *"The teachings speak of 'Heaven establishing the Central Yellow and Eight Poles to repay the supreme origin.' Where exactly are the Eight Poles aligned with the vault of heaven?"*

The Master said: *"This means repaying the origin and then returning to the source. The supreme is the Dao; the Central Yellow and Eight Poles are the principle. From the Dao, principle is born. Illuminating principle to repay the origin—this is the great meaning of the teachings. Our Lord of All Immortals once told me: 'Within the Nine Palaces of the Central Heaven, the radiance of the Central Yellow Great One is called the Heart of Heaven, also known as the Ancestral Earth. It is the source of generation and transformation in the world, the convergence of all principles. In truth, it is merely the accumulated yang qi that rose and spread after the opening of the primordial chaos, spanning 810,000 miles. It is the sovereign of all principles. The merits and transgressions of human hearts and minds are thoroughly illuminated by this radiance—no speck of dust or grain of millet can escape. Within the human body, it is called the Cinnabar Gate. Thus it is said that every human heart possesses the Supreme Ultimate. All causes and effects of good and evil cannot escape it, like a shadow following form, because it is fundamentally connected to the true reality of the upper realm. Therefore, those who study the Dao must first investigate principle and exhaust their nature to arrive at destiny. Those who understand principle find their own heart-heaven radiant and penetrating. Naturally, they do not obscure their words and actions and do not transgress against principle. They resolutely refuse to do even the slightest thing that obstructs principle—all because the heart is luminous. When the heart is luminous, one knows the whereabouts of the original nature."*

Having known one’s original nature, one must further trace the source of destiny. At this time, all defiling habits are eradicated, and yin impurities universally dissolve. Ascending into the supreme realm of purity and emptiness, the ultimate abode of the Dao—where the calamities of water, fire, and wind cannot reach—only then may one be called transcendent beyond yin and yang, beyond the reckonings of life and death.

Now, my disciples of the Dao, if you do not begin with personal practice and cultivation but merely discuss ordinary methods of refining essence and qi, this is called studying the Dao without understanding principle—advancing blindly while seeking what lies ahead. Even if you achieve minor accomplishments, you will not ascend into the realm of purity and emptiness. Thus, when your allotted span is exhausted, you will return and scatter into the various destinies—how can this not be feared?

The crux lies in the Yellow Center, a barrier one has not yet passed. As the common saying goes: "If you cannot surpass it in principle, why is this so? Because before reaching the halfway point of heaven, the myriad demons will not endorse you." What is meant by "not endorsing"? It is simply that in this person’s daily thoughts, they often engage in acts that obscure heavenly principle. Their conduct lacks the righteousness to command the respect of ghosts and spirits. Their private desires outweigh their public-mindedness, evil surpasses good, and yin overcomes yang—such a one will never manifest the bearing of great accomplishment.

But those who cultivate with impartial loyalty, uprightness, benevolence, filial piety, integrity, and clarity—these may unite with the Dao and truly transcend, ascending to the heavens of the seed-people, where there is none who does not achieve fulfillment.

The Master said: The misfortunes and blessings of a household seldom arise from anything but the karmic retributions of its daily conduct. Once, I was invited to a home to perform a ritual offering to the Perfected. As evening approached and I neared the gate, I saw from afar a black miasma shrouding the house. Upon arrival, the offerings were already prepared. I told them: "The Heavenly Perfected will not accept your offering." The host, startled, asked why. I said: "The inauspicious and rebellious qi of the world rises to heaven but cannot pass through the central Yellow Eight Extremes, instead descending to bring calamity upon people. Now, your home is veiled in black qi—it must have been summoned by some cause." The host then confessed: that morning, there had been a quarrel in the family. I said: "This is it. Yet such misfortune will not linger long. Even if you force yourself to make offerings, it will be in vain." I instructed them to remove the offerings. Sure enough, within days, an unexpected disaster struck.

Thus it is said: harmonious qi brings auspiciousness, while discordant qi brings harm—there is nothing that is not a matter of mutual resonance. I once saw in an old record a saying: "Abundant forbearance averts fierce calamity; if deceit and cunning arise, extraordinary misfortune follows." This, too, is nothing beyond the same principle.

The Master said: The *Daoist Canon* states that when one cultivates the Dao of true constancy and accomplishes the mysterious work, the deeds one performs are the wisdom of the Ten Sages, and the words one utters are the decrees of the Supreme. One can expand and contract creation, alter yin and yang, and there is nothing one cannot accomplish—how could this be a trifling matter? Yet in the practice of cultivation, with every step taken and every word spoken, if one does not accord with principle and the will of heaven, how can one dare hope to reach such a station?

The Master said: The various scriptures of the *Daoist Canon* teach nothing but to abandon evil and return to goodness, to forsake the crooked and follow the upright. Thus it is said: "Scripture" (*jing*) means "path" (*jing*)—it is the road to entering the Dao. Yet I often see people who are unwilling to vigorously eliminate their evil habits and overcome their selfishness, yet persist in reciting scriptures morning and night. The sages and worthies do not value such conduct—it is like a gibbon that can speak.

My disciples of the Dao must make this heart as bright as a mirror, as pure as water, illuminating even the slightest detail. Regard daily reform of faults and exaltation of conduct as the foremost duty. By accumulating all manner of expedient means, you will not be far from the Dao—this is superior to reciting a thousand or ten thousand volumes of scripture. If you do not cultivate virtue while seeking the Dao, your prospects for success will be dim. Thus it is said: Virtue is the foundation of the Dao, and the Dao is the flowering and fruition of virtue. Sit in stillness and ponder this with your eyes closed.

The Master said: When I first studied the Great Dao of Purity and Brightness, I did not recite many Daoist scriptures. I simply applied myself to the Confucian classics I had already memorized, taking such teachings as "honoring virtue and esteeming conduct" as my practice. Whenever I reflected on passages like: "Be reverent and cautious in what you do not see, fearful and apprehensive in what you do not hear"; "Words that are perverse when spoken will be perverse when received"; "Wealth obtained through perverse means will depart through perverse means"—such sayings inspired deep conviction in me, and I dared not deviate from them even for a moment.

As for the subtleties of applying the heart to the Dao: when people lose a chicken or a dog, they know to search for it, yet they do not know to seek their lost heart-mind. When the nocturnal qi is insufficient to preserve it, one’s conduct scarcely differs from that of birds and beasts—this realization naturally brings shame. At that time, I was so moved that it was as if boiling water or thorns pierced my body and heart. I thought: If I proceed idly without mastering this Dao, I will inevitably become a sinner against the forerunners of enlightenment. Truly, I could find no peace in rest or sleep.

Later, I gradually made progress, moved the vault of heaven, and found some joy in it. Reflecting in stillness, I realized it was all due to the power of that initial sense of shame.

The Master said: I have three ancient sayings that disciples may take to heart:
- Let your aspirations and resolve be lofty; do not indulge in base and filthy habits or seek quick results.
- Let your capacity be vast; do not be narrow and shallow, unable to embrace things.
- Let your conduct be upright; do not pursue selfish ends or follow the crooked and the transient.

The Master said: Those in the world who study the Dao with a coarse mind often claim they have no faults. How could this be so? It is simply that they have never settled into stillness to reflect. If they were to carefully compare themselves with the ancients who achieved fulfillment, they would see how far they fall short. Thus I often say: If a person cannot humble themselves, how can they hope to progress?

The Master said: The Perfected Lord Lan once said: When filial piety reaches heaven, the sun and moon shine brighter; when filial piety reaches earth, the myriad things flourish; when filial piety reaches the people, the human Dao is fulfilled.

Great indeed is filial piety! If people could but hold the two words "filial way" constantly within their hearts, their words would necessarily be loyal and trustworthy, their conduct necessarily sincere and respectful. Anger would gradually fade, desires would gradually lessen, faults could be corrected, and goodness could be embraced. The human Dao would then be complete, and one could thereby match heaven and earth—this is called the Three Powers.

If one cannot cultivate oneself through the filial way, common saying calls this "failing to be human," or "not living up to being human."

Someone asked: If the learning of rectifying the mind can be practiced to perfection, what need is there for Daoist methods?

The Master said: Such words might have been practicable in the middle ancient age. But now, with antiquity far removed and human hearts grown shallow and dissipated, even the *Analects of Lu*—though filled with the words of the Former Sage—has seen little practice. Some take "The Master did not speak of spirits" as an excuse, and the resulting abuse has led to reckless disregard, ignorance of sin and blessing, and widespread slander of cause and effect. Others make "heavenly principle" a mere facade while treating human desire as their path—this only burdens the true teaching.

When the human heart is deeply afflicted, Daoist methods serve as its acupuncture and medicine. Thus the ancients said: "To avoid faults of speech is easy; to avoid faults of conduct is difficult; to avoid faults of conduct is easy; to avoid faults of the heart is difficult." What is spoken aloud, others may hear. What is done in action, others may see. What is thought in the heart, the spirits know. If human intelligence cannot be deceived, how much less can the intelligence of the spirits? From this we see: to govern the faults of the human heart, none but the spirits can suffice. How then can Daoist methods be abandoned?

The Master said: Loyalty and filial piety stand foremost among the hundred virtues; the Central Yellow is the secret of the great Dao. All my disciples should cultivate themselves and act with caution, then extend this to aid others. Otherwise, to command and employ spirits is merely to accumulate sin and transgression.

The Master said: "The greatest principle in the world"—this was the saying of a worthy minister of a former dynasty. In my humble view, nothing in the world is as spiritually efficacious as principle, for reason arises from the Dao. To follow it brings fortune; to oppose it brings misfortune. Yet I often see those who twist and obscure principle: some boast grandly without substance to assert their qi, others scheme in secret and act perversely to gain advantage. To what extremes will they not go? No human power can resist them. But the Creator loves life and does not let them escape. Even if they escape legal punishment, they cannot avoid the judgment of spirits. Is the Creator unkind? It is simply that they bring suffering upon themselves.

Someone asked: In the Pure Brightness method, is there still recourse to driving out and punishing spirits?

The Master said: Generally speaking, those who practice the methods must first purify the several kinds of demons and goblins within their own breasts before they can expect to quell external evils. What are these demons and goblins? They are nothing but the thoughts that arise in the twelve hours of the day—greed for wealth, lust for beauty, perversity, cunning, wild and disordered imaginings. To eradicate these specters, one must first be fiercely resolute. The supreme Dao is accomplished through this; how much more so the practice of methods! Thus it is said: Only when one can govern the specters within can one subdue the evils without. If one cannot clear away the specters within, even if one achieves some minor efficacy, the heart of Heaven will not approve. Moreover, one should consider that after the body perishes, there will be matters of reckoning to face.

Someone asked: What method is there for eliminating evil thoughts?

The Master said: This lies in the work of refining the subtlest stirrings of the mind. What are the subtlest stirrings? It is like when the first sprouts of a noxious tree appear—one must uproot them immediately. If one waits until they grow tall, with branches and leaves spreading, it will be much harder to remove them. The *Book of Changes* says: "Treading on frost, solid ice is to come." This means that when one first treads on frost, one must prepare for the time when the yin qi grows strong and solid ice forms. Thus it is also said: "The noble person perceives the subtlest signs and acts without waiting for the day to end."

The Master said: The methods of this teaching are generally about learning the Dao of being human. Pure Brightness, loyalty, and filial piety are inherent in everyone’s duty—one need only be willing to take them up. Those who enter this teaching, whether they serve as officials or live in reclusion, can practice it anywhere. What is valued is loyalty to the ruler and filial piety to parents, honoring ancestors and benefiting descendants. As for summer linen and winter furs, drinking when thirsty and eating when hungry, there is little difference from ordinary people—it is only in the heart that one applies some effort at cultivation. This is not like the worldly idea of "cultivation," which involves strange appearances, unusual clothing, abandoning human affairs, and drowning in emptiness. Thus this learning does not lead to defiling oneself or disrupting human relations, nor does it harm righteousness or injure the teaching.

Someone asked: Daoist methods formerly used memorials and petitions, but now only family letters are sent up—is this not too simple?

The Master said: In ancient times, loyal ministers and filial sons relied solely on the power of their sincere intention to move and communicate. Those who practice methods today often do not cultivate themselves to seek such resonance but rely instead on burning written documents, which is why their efforts often go unanswered. For only virtue moves Heaven, and nothing is too distant to reach. Those who practice this great teaching today—if they can truly restrain anger, curb desires, and not deceive Heaven in their hearts—then when they make a request of Heaven, the very thought is sufficient. But if in ordinary times they indulge anger, give free rein to desires, and act contrary to Heaven and reason, then even if they write a hundred memorials and burn them, it will be of no avail. When disciples of the method have practiced to the point of mastery, even silent prayers will naturally resonate. Family letters will not be necessary.

Since ancient times, the immortals have taught people through scriptures, talismans, and incantations. But when the great teaching of Pure Brightness arose, from the very beginning it established altar records, altar inscriptions, discourses on the Dao, and explanations of methods—all grand compositions collectively called the *Books of Pure Brightness, Loyalty, and Filial Piety*.

Why do we often employ Confucian texts for transformation? This is where the teaching adapts its methods. Though scriptures, talismans, and incantations have long been used for instruction, Confucians frequently dismiss them as empty, absurd theories. Now, the Perfected Lord of All Immortals has renewed the teaching with true principles and orthodox learning. Since the instruments and vessels of the immortal arts require those who understand the Dao to assist in saving the world and delivering beings, thus aiding in the transformation and nurturing of all life, this approach is demonstrated here.

*Supplementary Collection of Master Yuzhen’s Recorded Sayings*
The Master said: Those who enter the gate of our great Dao of Loyalty and Filial Piety must first make prayers for the nation’s longevity and repay their parents’ kindness. Next, they should wish for timely rains and sunshine, abundant harvests, and universal peace throughout the land.

The Master said: The *Record of Longsha* was spoken by the Perfected Lord of All Immortals a thousand years ago. It is fully recorded in the *Yuzhang Gazetteer of Administrative Geography* and has circulated to this day—even children of three feet know of it. It is no groundless, unfounded theory. Longsha emerged in the Renwu year of the Zhiyuan era as an island in the heart of the Yuzhang River; it is no absurd, unverified claim. The essence of the Pure Brightness teaching lies in the wonders of the learning of the heart, instructing in loyalty and demanding filial piety. The canon of this great teaching does not depart from the Way of daily conduct; it is no fantastical, bizarre, or outlandish art. Truly, this is a once-in-a-millennium auspicious convergence—scholars, take heed!

Someone asked: May we hear of the Perfected Lord of All Immortals’ deeds in delivering beings?
The Master said: After the beginning of creation, the Perfected Lord was born bearing the residual qi of the Great Yang, just as the Wood Star possesses purple qi. In his three prior incarnations, he descended into his mother’s womb, which is why his mother dreamed of swallowing the essence of a red crow before conceiving. Later generations mistakenly transmitted the tale of a golden phoenix delivering a pearl. Born extraordinary, he grew and studied the Dao. After completing his inner refinement, his allotted yang years came to an end—this is what is called death. When he reappeared in the world, he no longer relied on the body inherited from his parents. Through accumulated cultivation of the supreme Dao, his inner refinement grew ever clearer, and he shed his form again to demonstrate to the people that all things have an end. By his third incarnation, it was precisely the second year of the Chiwu era of Wu, when a new reign title was established. As the immortal body abided in the world, its inner refinement became ever purer and brighter. After ascending, he became a star in the heavens—what is called the originally luminous and formless essence. It is also said that the legend of riding the tail of the Winnowing Basket refers to this meaning.

Someone asked: Yesterday, you taught that when the Perfected Lord of All Immortals appeared in his three incarnations, he did not rely on the body inherited from his parents. If this is so, why then did he have an immortal family?
The Master said: When the Perfected Lord appeared in his three incarnations, his inner refinement was already complete, unlike the intermediate-state bodies of ordinary beings that enter the womb. Those in the intermediate state rely entirely on the essence and blood of their parents to form a body. The immortal body, however, is a purely yang entity that gathers to form a shape and disperses to become qi, merely borrowing a dwelling. Thus, it does not depend on the inherited body of ordinary people. After birth, he still wore a cap, married, and held office. This was to manifest human relationships and practice loyalty and filial piety. Therefore, he had parents, a wife, and children; he was recommended for filial piety and integrity and appointed as a county magistrate. The immortal body manifested as an ordinary one—how could he be without family and kin?

Someone asked: Did the Perfected Lord of All Immortals truly ascend with his entire household?
The Master said: It was not the flesh-and-blood body, kitchen, house, chickens, or dogs rising into the nine heavens. Rather, those who attain the Dao refine themselves again and again. Once their inner refinement is perfected and all yin impurities are eliminated, their entire being becomes pure yang. When gathered, it forms a body; when dispersed, it becomes qi. Light and ethereal, they ascend, and the clear and refined return to Heaven—there is no doubt of this. As for the kitchen, house, chickens, and dogs, once the master’s Dao fruit is complete, spiritual beings naturally carry them away, though they remain only on islands beyond the seas.

The Master said: Thunder and lightning are merely the two qi of yin and yang, yet they are governed by two spirits, one good and one evil. Yang qi becomes thunder, yin qi becomes lightning. Thunder has sound, lightning does not. Thunder is good-natured, lightning is evil-natured. Thunder cherishes life, lightning brings death. When lightning strikes objects, it is not that the Supreme Emperor issues each command in detail. Rather, the impure qi of evil beings in the world naturally summons it. For those who are disloyal and unfilial, or things that harm the primordial qi, the mechanism of stern execution cannot tolerate their concealment. Once the yin qi descends and its dregs cannot ascend again, they take form on the earth—this is what is called "thunder axes." When yang thunder stirs, it is solely to bring forth life and awaken hibernating creatures. When yin lightning stirs, it is solely to injure, kill, burn, and strike—each follows its own kind. Where lightning strikes, thunder always provides water to heal people’s illnesses. This is the spiritual beings making amends for their transgressions, not losing their virtue of cherishing life. When lightning strikes an object, those nearby do not perceive it, but those afar hear a single thunderclap. This is the yang thunder drawing up the qi of yin lightning, for these two qi cannot be separated even for a moment. It is like refining cinnabar: sulfur bears the residual qi of the Great Yang, mercury bears the residual qi of the Great Yin. When the two congeal, they form a substance. If the crucible explodes, it is truly the sulfur that causes it. When sulfur stirs, mercury follows—this is the principle of yin following yang, equivalent to yang thunder drawing yin lightning.

The earlier Confucians spoke of thunder and lightning as merely the two qi of yin and yang congealing and striking, but their explanations did not extend to thunder chariots or stone axes.

Is it true that in Daoist teachings there exist names and varying attire for the Thunder Gods, or is this merely an illusion? I wish to have this doubt resolved.

The Master replied: Both are so. I have heard that the completeness of the Great Dao encompasses both the undifferentiated and the manifest. Consider thunder and lightning: one yin, one yang, their origin truly issues from the primordial Dao—this is what is meant by the undifferentiated. As Master Zhu said: "Before their issuance, qi does not act." Yet when punishing the unfilial and evil in the world, there are indeed Thunder Gods carrying out the decree—this is what is meant by the manifest. As seen in the histories, when Emperor Wu Yi of the Shang disrespected Heaven and hunted by the Yellow River, calling it "the gate," he was struck dead by lightning. And as the classics record, when Heaven moves in response, it invariably manifests the virtue of the Duke of Zhou. The undifferentiated is the Dao of the primordial. The manifest is the qi of the posterior heaven.

It is like the king’s decree to punish those who defy the court: when the clear and harmonious mandate issues forth, this is the moment when qi begins to act. Yet only the royal command is heard; no ranks of soldiers are seen—this resembles the undifferentiated Dao. Once the command is issued, generals, banners, troops, and weapons swiftly arrive at the frontier. Is this not the manifest? Likewise, when the hibernating awaken and spring advances, dragons are driven forth to bring rain—from this, the general principle may be understood.

True Confucians, holding to the learning of the primordial, recognize only the undifferentiated Dao and often do not elaborate on the details of the posterior heaven. It is not that they are unaware, but rather that they choose not to speak of it. Those of the posterior heaven’s ritual schools recognize only the Thunder Generals and their ilk, seeing nothing but the manifest qi. At times, when they open their altars and thunder arises, they act with reckless abandon, lacking true understanding. Only those who have ascended to the source and witnessed it firsthand grasp the inner workings.

The primordial and posterior, the undifferentiated and manifest—none are not so.

It is further said: Qian is Heaven, descending as dew. Kun is Earth, ascending as mist. Their ascent and descent form sweet dew. Gen is the mountain, concealing clouds within. Zhen is thunder, stirring and giving life to the myriad things. Xun is wind, arising from the Xun position. Li is fire, hence there is thunder. Kan pertains to water, issuing forth lightning to execute punishment. Dui is the marsh; metal generates water, and the rain department is governed by it.

Someone asked: What is the principle by which the two qi of yin and yang transform into forms?

The Master replied: When yin strikes and yang excites, they burst forth as thunder. When yin congeals and yang flows, they race forth as lightning. When yin is weak and yang abundant, they rise as wind. When yin is abundant and yang weak, they gather as clouds. When yin and yang ascend and descend, they steam forth as rain. When yin and yang harmonize and spread, they descend as snow. When yin obstructs and yang dissolves, they fly as frost. When yin scatters and yang is at peace, they spread as dew. When ascent and descent cannot proceed, they transform into mist. When yin and yang are obstructed, they congeal as hail. Excessive water becomes a rainbow; excessive fire becomes a drought demon.

Someone asked: There are those in the world who neglect virtuous conduct yet, when practicing Daoist methods, find their talismans and generals efficacious. How can this be?

The Master replied: Such individuals in past lives accumulated merit and affinity within Daoist teachings, and thus in this life receive such recompense. However, if they further cultivate conduct and comprehend the Dao, only then may their merit be called enduring. If they disregard virtue and the Dao, this is but a fleeting satisfaction. In the unseen realm after death, their affairs will not be few.

Someone asked: Why are the talismanic commands in the Jingming tradition so exceedingly simple?

The Master replied: A talisman embodies the meaning of accord. In primordial talismanic commands, the brushwork often emphasizes lightness and clarity. One need not rigidly adhere to intricate seal scripts to call it a talisman; what accords with the Dao in its application is a talisman. Thus, when the forms are identical, often just four characters are written. When used at the most potent moment, when primordial qi returns to the root, the spiritual power is greatest. Wherever it reaches, the yang path overcomes yin, like the sun melting ice. What it encounters is shattered; what it touches is broken. The vitality of life is as evident as a spark at the tip of a blade.

Someone asked: Why did the Confucians Zhou, Cheng, Zhu, and Zhang, in their writings, vigorously refute teachings of emptiness and annihilation?

The Master replied: They were all heavenly beings, having come from the ranks of immortals and buddhas, acting with impartiality for the Dao. Thus, they were born among the Confucians to rectify the world’s biases. Generally, the teachings of the Three Schools all guide people toward goodness; none can be lacking in the world. Yet if the teachings of the Two Schools (Buddhism and Daoism) become too dominant, they may inadvertently harm the teachings of human relations. It is like a boat listing to one side: one must shift one’s position to balance it before it can proceed smoothly. The Dao is likewise.

Moreover, true immortals and true monks have purified all human desires, leaving only their innate nature. Yet such individuals are rare, and the later generations often fall into corruption. Thus, true Confucians emerge with substantive principles and orthodox learning to restore and adorn the teachings. Once the restoration is complete, they depart with ease, returning to the realm of heavenly beings.

Someone further asked: How can we know they were heavenly beings?

The Master replied: Observe their exquisite analysis of the Supreme Polarity—these are people who have attained true understanding. What else could they be but heavenly beings? If the early Confucians had no personal realization of the Dao, how could Master Zhou compose the *Taiji Diagram* and the *Tongshu*? How could Master Cheng’s commentary on the *Book of Changes* so perfectly accord with the Dao? As for Master Shao’s *Huangji Jingshi Book*, it was entirely revealed through deep meditation in the mountains. Zhu Xi and Zhang Nanxuan’s commentaries on the *Four Books* were all composed by those who had retired and gained insight. If Master Lu had no attainment, how could he become the founder of a school? His prayer for snow at the end of his life was particularly extraordinary.

If they were mere fabricators, how could they have won the hearts of all under heaven and later generations? Know this: true Confucians all emerge from a state of reverent caution and awe, speaking only after directly perceiving the essence of the Dao—such words leave them utterly without shame in any posture.

Someone asked: If these Confucians are said to be heavenly beings, what evidence supports this?

The Master replied: Carefully examining the *Scripture of Salvation* annotated by the Perfected One of Azure Prime from Shu, we find: "Above the Three Realms dwell the Four Kinds of Heavenly People, most of whom are the sagely rulers and worthy ministers of past ages—figures like Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius." When vast kalpas cycle and the primordial chaos unfolds, these heavenly beings descend into the human world to initiate affairs and perfect things, thereby instructing the people. They are the seed-people, hence called *zhongmin* (seed-people).

I once read the *Biography of Lin Shichen*: one day, upon entering court, he saw the stele inscribed with the "Treacherous Clique of the Yuanyou Era," where the names of worthies such as Sima Guang and Cheng Yi were all listed. Lin bowed deeply before it. The emperor, surprised, asked why he paid homage. Lin replied: "Those now condemned as traitors by the current ministers—when I see their names, they appear to me as the names of celestial asterisms."

Consider also Master Kangjie’s final words: "I dreamt of banners, cranes, and wild geese leading me through myriad mountains—my spirit departs." As for Master Huian, he was originally a transcendent of the Wuyi Grotto-Heaven, who descended to uphold the Confucian teaching for a time. In his later years, he lingered among the mountains, as his writings attest. Even the Jade Toad of Purple Clarity held him in the highest esteem, praising his portrait with these words:

*"When the August Polarity fell to earth, you returned to heaven—*
*Amid Wuyi’s pines and bamboo, the sun sets with the cry of cicadas."*

And again:

*"The dream between the pillars has passed;*
*The ineffable wonder of ‘only this’ remains untransmitted."*

Master Huian also once annotated the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, and frequently engaged in Daoist discourse with the Daoist Fu Yun’an of the Iron Pillar Palace. He composed a poem for him, which reads:

*"Wherever I go, men speak of Madman Fu—*
*Gazing at one another, we know we met in former lives.*
*You directly lift the Northern Dipper to pour the Milky Way,*
*And depart to become the second immortal of the Dragon Palace."*

To this day, his handwritten legacy and portrait remain enshrined in the Hall of Cultivating Virtue within the same palace.

Yet in the words and writings of the former Confucian masters, one finds only restrained and repressive language—subtly, this is the blessing of the world’s Way and the fortune of the Two Teachings. Those of the present age fail to perceive it; only in quiet reflection can one grasp this principle.

Someone asked: *"Could the world suffice with only the Confucian teaching?"*
He replied: *"What words are these? If the teachings of the Two Schools could be destroyed, Heaven would have long since annihilated them. How could they persist to this day?"*

Later scholars, upon encountering the words and writings of the former masters, must grasp their essential intent: they serve to uphold and adorn the world’s teaching. One need not cling rigidly to their phrasing like a zither pegged in place. Rather, it is best to cultivate oneself in silence.

Some, without first measuring their own virtue and conduct, upon glimpsing the words of the former masters, proceed to vehemently reject and denounce them. How much better it would be to turn inward and examine one’s own life—whether one has fulfilled one’s duties to parents without fail, whether one has truly extricated oneself from the snares of profit and desire as the ancients did, living as if on ice or among sprouts, and whether one remains unashamed in the hidden corners of a room.

If, in conduct and practice, one has truly attained the level of the former masters, then one must remember that men like Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Zhu were all reincarnated beings, all men of great fortune. Since I have not yet reached such a state, I dare not add further words.

Generally, if a person’s inherent store of fortune is meager, and they recklessly give free rein to their tongue without restraint, their fortune will only grow thinner. The signs of thin fortune are evident: throughout life, one’s fate is perverse and thwarted, and nine out of ten matters turn out contrary to one’s wishes. When fortune is thin, one’s karmic burden grows heavier; with a heavier burden, upon rebirth, one’s countenance will be altogether different.

By and large, immortals and buddhas are those who have accumulated great fortune and virtue over countless kalpas. In saving the world and protecting living beings, their merit cannot be called negligible—it is not for us to lightly criticize them.

In truth, among the world’s clever scholars, if one does not begrudge the effort to cultivate oneself, continually advancing without cease, when one finally attains the station of the sages, one will nod and smile, knowing my words are not false.

The Master said: *"The Buddhist admonitions warn: ‘If one fails to provide sweet delicacies for one’s parents, the six relations will have already abandoned one. If one cannot pacify the state and govern the realm, one’s family estate will be swiftly forsaken, and one’s descendants cut off.’ From this perspective, those who leave the household life exhibit the resolve of one who crosses a river and burns the boat behind them. One should reflect thus: having retreated, the boat is already burned; advancing, one must naturally strive with effort. By ‘striving with effort,’ I mean strictly upholding the precepts and single-mindedly abiding in the Dao. Or, through diligent labor and capable service, through the merit of incense and offerings, one will naturally reap good karmic fruits in time. If one cannot take to heart these four lines of admonition, still indulging in wine and meat, lust and greed, differing little from the vulgar below, passing one’s days in carefree ease, drifting through life unheeding and unaware—one’s life will slip away like a shuttle through the loom. How much worse for those who eat without plowing, clothe themselves without tending silkworms, daily receive the offerings of humans and gods, yet feel no shame, knowing no repayment. What they receive in bliss, they will repay in suffering; when evil circumstances befall them, regret will come too late. Ponder this carefully."*

Someone asked: *"Why do some prayers yield no immediate response?"*
The Master replied: *"Rain and sunshine are vital to the generative force of Heaven and Earth. How could sincere entreaties fail to be answered? But if one’s daily cultivation and self-nurturance do not align with the heart of Heaven, and one suddenly seeks a response, is this not difficult? When human effort is exhausted, the principle of Heaven will naturally manifest."*

Another asked: *"The methods of refinement and deliverance in various schools often involve a hundred or more talismans, completing forms and restoring bodies. Yet the Pure Brightness teaching employs only one talisman for refinement and deliverance—is this not too simplistic?"*
The Master said: *"The supreme Dao is not cumbersome. It is simply a matter of transforming evil with goodness, restraining yin with yang, gathering the myriad into three, and the three into one. Through refining and dissolving the dregs of yin, the body becomes pure and naturally transforms. I observe that the methods of the posterior heaven, without having thoroughly mastered a fundamental principle, produce many extraneous branches and flowers—merely adding more delusions to already fallen souls. The Pure Brightness teaching of the prior heaven seeks only to realize the kernel within: that within benevolence (*ren*) there is a spark of life. Concealed within earth, when the spring qi stirs, roots sprout, trunks grow—all emerges naturally. Have you ever seen Heaven personally carve branches and leaves?"*

He further said: *"At night, when stillness prevails, the numinous spirits of yin are easily reached; in the brightness of day, the earthly deities are difficult to commune with. Matters concerning the netherworld must be addressed in the quiet of night."*

Another asked: *"I have now heard the wondrous simplicity of the school’s method of refinement and deliverance. But may I inquire into the meaning of ‘the single yang’?"*
He replied: *"In the beginning of the primordial chaos, it was like a full vat, entirely akin to turbid water. After long settling, the light and pure floated upward, the heavy and turbid sank downward—thus Heaven and Earth were divided. As soon as above and below were separated, a single speck of true yang was born within, and this is what we call the sun. From my perspective, from ancient times to the present, within Heaven and Earth, it is this single speck of yang light that serves as the sovereign, sufficient to govern the world. As for yin, it is not a separate entity, but merely the shadow of yang. Thus it is said that yin follows yang, and also that yin and yang do not part for even a moment. The scriptures say: ‘The true essence of the great yang is the ancestor of the myriad things.’ They also say: ‘The moon has no light of its own; at its fullest, it is like a black mirror. The sun’s radiance shines upon the water’s light, reflecting it to become brightness.’ The scriptures further say: ‘The moon awaits the sun’s illumination.’"*

This too conveys the same meaning.

It is further said: "The essence of the nine yangs becomes the sun; the essence of the ten yins becomes the moon. The essences of the sun and moon harmonize to form the stars." From this perspective, the stars and moon all receive the sun’s light, making it clear that within Heaven and Earth, it is this single speck of yang light that governs the myriad things. By merely invoking the character *yang* (旸), the light of the stars and moon is already encompassed within it. To speak of the "Three Lights" is to become entangled in fragmentation and dispersion. To invoke *yang* alone is to speak of convergence and unity. Like tracing a tree to its roots or water to its source, returning to the origin restores life. When the primordial *qi* gathers into oneness, is this not wondrous?

Someone asked: Why not simply write the character for *yang* (阳) in "yin and yang," but instead use *yang* (旸) with the "sun" radical? What meaning does this convey?

I reply: According to rhyme annotations, *yang* (旸) means "sunrise" and also "the sun’s *qi*." This is because all the souls of the departed, when their eye-light first fell to the earth, returned wholly to yin. Thus, it is called the "Gate of Darkness" or the "Eternal Night," where they endure all manner of suffering and see no light. Those who now undergo refinement look upward to receive the illumination of the yang light. It is like the deep of night suddenly glimpsing the first light at the edge of the sea, where all things and spirits are mutually illumined. Or like the clearing of long rain, where the human heart naturally becomes joyful and at ease. This is what is meant by "sunrise." For those who undergo refinement repeatedly, accumulated yang naturally generates a warming *qi*, just as a cold valley revives in spring, snow melts, ice thaws, and the grasses and trees sprout forth in vibrant life. This is what is meant by "the sun’s *qi*." The meaning of *yang* (旸) in the refinement and deliverance of souls is thus.

Someone asked: Earlier, it was said that yin is the shadow of yang. Does yin, then, also contain a governing spirit?

I reply: Yang has its supreme spirit—the Supreme Yang Lord. Yin has its supreme spirit—the Supreme Yin Sovereign. How could there be no governing sage? The veneration of yang and the honoring of yin are based on this principle.

It is further said: Even the shadow of the human body has its spirit and way. The *Book of Rites* speaks of a person’s shadow increasing the light of a torch, countable up to nine. Each of the nine shadow spirits has its own name. In ancient times, some divined a person’s nobility, longevity, or early death by observing the density of their shadow, while others cured illnesses by moxibustion on the shadow. Even creatures like the *gu* insect and the mantis shoot their poison at a person’s shadow—how could there be no spirit?

Someone asked: Between the two luminaries, why is there a crow in the sun and a rabbit in the moon? What meaning does this convey?

I reply: The sun’s body is yang on the outside and yin within; the moon’s substance is yin on the outside and yang within. The golden crow in the sun truly represents the yin within yang, while the jade rabbit in the moon truly represents the yang within yin. Thus, it is said that the essences of *kan* (坎) and *li* (离) mutually reside in each other’s abodes. In the past, I received the teachings of the Perfected Lord of the Capital directly: when crafting the fire talisman for refinement and deliverance, first place a black dot at the center of the circular symbol; for the water talisman, first place a red dot at the center. This precisely captures the meaning of water-yin rooted in yang and fire-yang rooted in yin. Thus, the scriptures say: "The dark crow and the white rabbit exchange celestial essences," expressing the wondrous principle of yin and yang’s endless generation.

Someone asked: In the method of "Pure Brightness" for reporting to the Dipper, why is no Dipper lamp set up? Why are the talismans and commands so few?

I reply: Do you know the origin of the stars and the Dipper? It is the Supreme Ultimate, the source of the One True. From the Supreme Ultimate arise yin and yang and the Five Phases, which Heaven bestows upon humanity, called the "established norms of the Five Constants." The scriptures say: "The sun, moon, and five stars are called the Three Lights. Their correspondences are called the Great Chief and the Seven Primes: the Radiant Yang (Sun) is *Tanlang*, the Yin Essence (Moon) is *Jumen*—these are the sun and moon. The remaining five stars correspond to the Five Phases." The great brightness of the Seven Luminaries, which illuminates all directions, is merely the essence of the "two fives" within Heaven and Earth. Yet these all belong to the posterior heaven. Returning to truth and restoring the origin, they merge into the Supreme Ultimate and revert to formlessness—this is the Great Way of Pure Brightness, the fundamental principle of the prior heaven. Thus, to penetrate the true and reach the numinous, one must grasp the *qi* at its inception. Now, in the Pure Brightness method, the lamps of the Two Luminaries and the Nine *Qi*, and the talismans used for reporting, are directed toward this. The Perfected Lord of the Capital once decreed: "This is called the Dipper of the prior heaven," referring to the Supreme Ultimate. It is like tracing a stream to its source or grasping the collar when putting on a robe. The method of the prior heaven values simplicity, focusing effort at the point of origin. Thus, it is swift without haste and arrives without movement.

Yet if one does not know the wondrous workings of the Central Yellow and Supreme Unity within one’s own body, how can one move the heart of the Northern Culmen in Heaven? If one relies solely on the complexity of visualization and the multitude of talismans and charms, I see only the scattering of spirit and the dispersal of *qi*. Where, then, lies the wondrousness of the One True? From this perspective, without a master of the fundamental art, this method is not easily practiced.

Someone asked: May I hear about the Perfected Lord of the Capital’s sword for slaying dragons?

I reply: The Daoist sword—its blade of wisdom and edge of insight—truly emerges from a single *qi*. Before it is unsheathed, it is still and unmoving, which is what is meant by "that which is above form is called the Dao." Once unsheathed, it becomes "that which is below form is called an instrument." Like a star falling to earth and becoming stone, or the place struck by thunder leaving behind an axe, these are the dregs of yin *qi*. The sword preserved at the Xuantan Abbey in Luling is neither iron nor stone, no longer than a foot—it is truly the dregs of the blade of wisdom and the edge of insight.

Someone asked: Is there truth to the legend that the Perfected Lord of the Capital commanded ghostly laborers to cast the iron pillar?

I reply: The divine way establishes teachings to universally transform those of lesser capacity. In truth, it is merely the essence of the earth congealing into form. Its manifestation has its verifications and seasons. At that time, the Perfected Lord of the Capital had perfected the Dao-fruit, and the *qi* of Heaven and Earth responded without fail.

This pillar was not artificially smelted and cast but appeared naturally to suppress and stabilize the entire region. Just as in the Qinglong era of the Wei dynasty, when the waters of Liugu Gorge in Zhangye surged forth with precious stones, foreshadowing the rise of the Jin dynasty; or in the Zhenguan reign of the Tang, when five stones of azure substance with white veins suddenly welled up in Hongchi Gorge of Songzhou’s Songchang, presaging the divine mandate of the Li clan.

The Master said: Those who seek to study under me must personally inscribe their vows and submit them to me as their teacher. I shall then memorialize the Perfected Lord of the Capital, who will in turn petition the heavens, proclaiming the transmission across the Three Realms and conferring ordination in accordance with the Dharma. There is no need for formal memorials or elaborate rituals of thanksgiving, nor should one incur debt or wasteful expenditure.

*Supplementary Collection of the Jade Perfected Master’s Recorded Sayings*

Someone asked: Before the Most High revealed oral instructions and before the immortals composed alchemical scriptures, even insects and grasses knew how to transform. If one falls into verbal explanations, it becomes entirely irrelevant. I have heard that within the teachings there exists a text called *The Book of Purity, Brightness, Loyalty, and Filial Piety*—is this not an offshoot of discourse and a burden of words?

The Master replied: Within my teaching, there is the Great Central and Perfectly Upright Dao, the secret never transmitted by a thousand sages, which exists beyond words and texts—have you ever heard of it? The circulation of written teachings is but an expedient method, not the true Dharma. The true Dharma is simply the One. What is the One? The Most High’s Purity and Brightness, Confucius’ loyalty and reciprocity, and Gautama’s Mahayana—all are this One. Extending the discussion, Emperor Shun’s holding to the center, Yao’s sincere adherence to the mean, Shun’s essence and oneness, Yu’s Great Plan, Tang’s daily ascent in sagely reverence, King Wen’s ceaseless purity, Yi Yin’s singular virtue, Mencius’ cultivation of *qi*, and Zisi’s *Doctrine of the Mean*—all are this One. Though their expressions differ, the Dao is the same. The sages knew the Dao cannot be spoken and thus used words to reveal it; they knew the Dao cannot be transmitted and thus used the mind to realize it. Terms like "embracing the origin and guarding the One," "exhausting principle and fulfilling nature," and "illuminating the mind and seeing nature" are but words for those who have not yet forgotten mental methods. Only in our Purity and Brightness Great Teaching do former and later sages merge with the real through spirit and realize the Dao through the mind, without falling into verbal explanations or becoming entangled in the dust of dharmas. The reason for unfolding profound meanings through words is not something we willingly choose but is done to guide learners from the broad to the essential, from cultivation to realization, returning from the postnatal to the prenatal, restoring the nameless from the named, aligning with the Purity and Brightness of effortless non-action. At this stage, even the sages’ expedient methods become like the meaning of a shortcut through the classics.

The Master said: The movement of the human mind is swayed by external things. At the moment of contact with things, one must turn inward to observe and stem the source—this is what is called "return." In all things, movement inevitably returns to stillness. Thunder roars, winds stir, and myriad transformations arise, yet all ultimately return to quiescence—this is their root.

The Master said: The "Limitless" is what the Most High called the "Valley Spirit," referring to its essence. The "Supreme Ultimate" is the Mysterious Female, referring to its function. The valley is empty yet responds perfectly; the spirit is numinous and without fixed form. The most numinous of things resides in the most empty of places. When this is achieved, the transformations of the Qian Dao proceed, and each being is settled in its nature and destiny—this is why the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth.

The Master said: The Great Dao gave birth to me from nothingness and placed me in emptiness. My solitary spirit is firmly rooted in the Great Beginning. What can be seen is form, yet when one seeks that by which form is seen, it cannot be found. What can be heard is sound, yet when one seeks that by which sound is heard, it cannot be found. A person’s ears, eyes, hands, and feet are all formed in existence, yet they must rely on that which is formless within to move them—just as empty space, though formless, takes the forms of the ten thousand things as its form. Only nothingness can encompass the ten thousand existences without remainder, thus constituting the essence of the Great Dao. Only existence can manifest the wondrous function of the One Nothingness, thus accomplishing the work of the Great Dao.

The Master said: The Dao resides in things, perfectly blended and without separation—this is the constant Dao. The Dao disperses into things, distinguishing and naming them—this is the inconstant Dao. From the Limitless comes the Supreme Ultimate; from the Supreme Ultimate come the Two Modes; from the Two Modes come the Five Phases. From nothing to something, the One root branches into the ten thousand differences. The Five Phases are one with yin and yang; yin and yang are one with the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is originally the Limitless. From something to nothing, the ten thousand differences return to the One root. Only by turning inward in sincerity and returning to the One are the ten thousand things all complete within me.

The Master said: The Purity and Brightness Prenatal Great Dao originates from the One *Qi*. The One *Qi* circulates ceaselessly day and night, flowing and ascending, giving rise to the beginnings of things—this is the metaphysical, heaven. The great earth flows forth in form, vast and all-embracing, high and low in its vast consciousness, giving birth to things—this is the physical, earth. The Dao establishes the Central Yellow within, and its laws extend to the Eight Extremities. With the One Correct and Eight Governances, heaven is clear and earth is tranquil—this is the human, standing between the two. The myriad transformations of heaven and earth, the peoples and creatures, all live, transform, exist, and perish by a single luminous principle—who is the master? Were it not for the Purity and Brightness teaching of loyalty and filial piety, upholding the moral order, human relationships would collapse and the principles of life would cease. Nevertheless, those of resolute learning embody great loyalty and great filial piety, rooted in heavenly nature. They practice them naturally, effortlessly attaining the mean. Thus, in our Purity and Brightness teaching, there is not a single word to transmit.

When the age fell into the decline of the lesser kalpa, and the world was swept by frivolous customs, those who acted did so in myriad ways and with countless motives. Thus, the Most High, moved by the virtue of cherishing life and pitying the unevenness of human existence, could not but make His laws manifest.

The Perfected Lord of All Immortals said: The superior person establishes loyalty and filial piety through culture and leads the world with words. What is called "culture," what is called "words," are the binding precepts. By holding to these precepts, those of middling capacity and below do not lose the way of the noble person, while those of middling capacity and above naturally ascend beyond them. If one can truly be thus, one should then take this Dao to assist in the transformations of creation and extend it to others—hence the methods for praying for clear skies and rain, healing illnesses, and dispelling evil. Every talisman and seal within these methods is the numinous script of yin and yang, the pledge of heaven and earth’s spirits. To embody them is to stand without a single word; to employ them is to penetrate all methods. All disciples of our method who attain the utmost refinement of truth must, before lifting the brush, inwardly fathom this: the moment a thought stirs, it already belongs to the posterior heaven. For the communion between heaven and humanity admits not a single moment’s interruption. What moves through perfect sincerity strikes the mark like an arrow—this is what is meant by "the perfect sincerity of a thought before it has stirred."

When submitting petitions, one must set aside all distractions and settle into the clarity of the one true reality. Then, in the moment of action, one’s wondrous applications will flow freely in all directions, unhindered—how could this apply only to talismans and seals? This is what is meant by "gathering it within the square inch, the Supreme Ultimate resides in the body; extending it to the ten thousand affairs, its wondrous use is inexhaustible."

The Master said: The Perfected Lord of All Immortals, Jade Perfected Teaching Master, transmitted the scriptures to He Zhengong and others during the Xinhai year of the Shaoxing era of the Song. He said: The inferior person invokes talismanic water and prepares medicinal remedies to cure one’s own illness or save another’s single affliction, calling this "merit"—but it is not merit, merely a skillful means of the Daoist gate. Our loyalty, filial piety, and Purity and Brightness are employed as a minister: raising all the people of the world to benevolence and longevity, setting the four seas in order and returning them to great peace, so that the ruler is at ease and the people naturally prosper, and the myriad things follow their nature. Employed as a general, leading the three armies to subdue the enemy without battle, our troops are ever-victorious. With our loyalty, we teach the disloyal to become loyal; with our filial piety, we teach the unfilial to become filial—how can such merit be measured?

He also said: The superior person need not enter the mountains, sever human affairs, abandon a spouse, retreat to seclusion, or forsake glory to be called one who refines the self. One should refine the heart and nature. When the heart is bright and the nature is enlightened, with filial piety and fraternal duty unblemished, one differs from the emaciated youths of the mountains and marshes. The Dao of loyalty and filial piety does not necessarily mean long life, yet the nature of long life endures; though one dies, one’s awareness does not fade, and one is ranked among the immortals—this is called long life. Those who speak of cultivating qi to prolong years have grasped but a fraction of it.

The noble person’s attainment of the Dao consists of eight virtues, which are the Eight Treasures: Bi Gan died remonstrating—this is loyalty; Great Shun remained filial all his life—this is filial piety; Shan Juan sacrificed himself—this is integrity; Nan Rong returned the jade—this is prudence; Rong Qi endured poverty—this is magnanimity; Yan Hui lived on a bamboo basket and gourd ladle—this is abundance; Shu Du possessed a vast capacity—this is tolerance; Gong Yi forgave others—this is forbearance. Such people are ranked among the immortals.

Those of later ages who have lost the Dao, being neither loyal nor filial, bring chaos to their states. When the state collapses, they have no place to dwell and falsely claim to enter the mountains to study the Dao—this is like abandoning a mansion to enter a raging fire. Have you not seen that the disloyal among the people give rise to rapacious ministers, and the unfilial among children produce descendants who ruin the family?

He also said: The superior person establishes loyalty and filial piety through culture and leads the world with words. The middling person establishes loyalty and filial piety through resolve and takes the lead in conduct. The inferior person achieves loyalty and filial piety through effort and serves as an example to the multitude. Thus, those registered at the Purity and Brightness Abbey ascend as immortals, and the Dao of loyalty and filial piety is fulfilled.

The Master said: With clods for drums and earthenware for vessels, with defiled cups and broken bowls, the rites and music are still present. Thus, there is music without sound and rites without form. The music of bells and chimes is the golden resonance that sets jade vibrating. When performing purification fasts and setting up offerings, one must strike the chime stone to summon the celestial spirits and sound the bell to invoke the earthly deities. Throughout the proceedings, the essence lies in harmony and tranquility. When harmony prevails, restless thoughts dissolve; when tranquility reigns, desires are pacified. Thus, the heart is upright and the intent sincere, aligning with non-action—hence one becomes one with heaven and earth. Nowadays, people who do not understand this principle strike and sound instruments, striving for grandeur and intensity, which muddles the heart and ears, arousing desires and overwhelming the emotions. No wonder the communion between heaven and humanity is severed.

Moreover, offering wealth and setting out provisions merely expresses sincerity. A poor scholar with sincere intent may offer a ladle of water. As it is said, "The eastern neighbor’s slaughter of an ox is not as good as the western neighbor’s simple sacrifice." Thus, "the greatest sound is soundless, and the greatest rite is simplicity."

The Master said: The rituals and methods of purification fasts and Daoist rites are merely the accumulation of sincerity, aiming for a response between heaven and humanity at the time of the offering. Yet I often see that during the morning rites, the proceedings are overly cumbersome, and by the time of the sacrificial offering, the sincerity of the host and the ritualists has already waned. Those who perform purification fasts should take heed.

The Master said: The Dao cannot be named; what can be named are merely things. The Dao cannot be transmitted; what can be transmitted is merely teaching. Nevertheless, the Dao in the world has never been without a name or transmission. The Dao having a name is like carving a vessel from unhewn wood: within every vessel, there exists something beyond form. The Dao having a transmission is like the great potter’s primordial qi circulating through the four seasons, with the myriad things each following their nature—within every living thing, there is one who grasps its mechanism. Our great teaching of Purity and Brightness traces its origin to the Most High, and in its verbal explanations, it embodies the essence of "holding to the One and grasping the mean."

The Orthodox Unity’s slaying of the demonic, the Three-and-Five Flying Steps, the Precelestial Five Thunders, and the Single Yang’s Refinement and Salvation—these are the greatest among what can be named and transmitted. The methods of seeking the Dao, though not confined to these, do not lie beyond them.

The Master said: People today possess the Dao but lack virtue, observing fasts before receiving the precepts—this is like carrying firewood to extinguish a fire.

The Master said: Nature is like the sun; the body is like the moon. Astrologers, by reckoning the time of a person’s birth, determine the hour of the sun’s rising as the establishment of fate—this is our nature. They take the moon’s position as the place of bodily repose—this is our body. Body and fate, endowed with qi, naturally depend upon one another—why is this? The moon resides where the sun dwells; the body resides where nature dwells. The luminous awareness and perception of human nature are not the spirit of one’s parents, but the spirit of one’s own nature. Before birth, this essence soars through the vast emptiness, coming and going without obstruction. Only upon emerging from the mother’s womb does this nature suddenly attach itself, and body and fate never part—just as the moon’s nascent crescent must first meet the sun, called the "union of jade disks," this is the moment of sudden attachment. The moon has no light of its own; it borrows brightness from the sun. The sun’s radiance is the luminous clarity of our nature. The moon’s waxing and waning depend on the sun’s distance—this is our life and death.

Shengsheng said: The Mandate of Heaven flows and transforms, nurturing the myriad things—there is nothing that is not the Dao. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations shine forth in ordered array—there is nothing that is not the scripture. Thunder’s roar and lightning’s strike, frost’s clarity and snow’s brilliance—there is nothing that is not the dharma. Even in the subtlest things—birds calling in secluded groves, fish leaping in jade streams, clouds gathering and dispersing, waterfalls murmuring—all such scenes reveal the entry points for humanity. Thus, the hexagram *Fu* takes the inception of movement as the place where the heart of Heaven and Earth is seen.

The Master said: In high antiquity, yin and yang harmonized, winds and rains were timely, people and creatures flourished, and ghosts and spirits did not disturb—all was the effect of the qi of Great Harmony, the transformative influence of the noble person’s virtue and spiritual presence.

The Master said: Loyalty and filial piety are the innate knowledge and capacity of ministers and children; everyone possesses this Heavenly principle—it is not an external matter. If one acts as though bestowing virtue upon ruler or father, seeking fame and praise, then one is no different from Hua Shi Yuan or Shao Zheng Mao.

The Master said: To stand in the most difficult position as a minister or child, yet be able to master adaptability to accomplish the great constants of the world and establish its great foundation—such were the Great Shun and Bi Gan. Thus, Shen Sheng awaited his execution to fulfill his reverence, yet only Shun is praised for not entrapping his father in unkindness. Weizi left Yin to preserve the ancestral sacrifices, yet only Bi Gan is praised for upholding the great integrity of a minister. Loyalty and filial piety in ministers and children may or may not spare them from execution—there is fortune and misfortune. Had the Great Shun, Shen Sheng, Weizi, and Bi Gan exchanged places, each would have acted likewise.

The Master said: In the mutual resonance of things, there are those that are swift without haste and arrive without movement—fire kindled by flint, water’s response to fire, the vast distance between heaven and earth, the needle drawn to lodestone—all communicate across separation. If one understands that the talismans of the ritual masters are like flint, and one’s own spirit is the true water and fire, then one may speak of the Dao and its methods. Not only do things operate thus, but people do as well: when a mother bites her finger, her child’s heart stirs—this is the resonance of qi and kind.

Someone asked: Confucianism is the teaching of action, Daoism the teaching of non-action. The application of Confucianism is to order all within Heaven and Earth, while Daoism’s application is to transcend Heaven and Earth—may I hear of this?

The reply: If you do not yet understand the teaching of action, how can you understand the teaching of non-action?

Someone asked: The Great Teaching of Purity and Brightness begins with establishing loyalty and filial piety as its foundation, proceeds through eliminating desire and rectifying the mind, and culminates in true purity and luminosity. Yet quieting the mind is exceedingly difficult, for between the sun and moon, Heavenly principle and the human mind vie for supremacy—what is to be done?

The reply: The preceding thought is "thought"; the following thought is "illumination." When a thought arises, do not cling to it—maintain a pure mind and guard the One. Subdue only the moving mind, not the illuminating mind. Concentrate only the empty mind, not the fixated mind. Profound stillness is called the "empty mind." Cessation returning to cessation is called the "illuminating mind." When stillness and illumination are both complete, they merge with the source of the Dao. When purity reaches its extreme, luminosity arises—mysterious and yet more mysterious.

The Master said: Unmoving stillness is the Limitless; responsive communication is the Supreme Ultimate. The Limitless is the highest realm of Purity and Brightness. Yet the Celestial Yellow Great Yang is the Limitless of the celestial realm, and the August Lord of the Vast Heaven is its Supreme Ultimate. The Terrestrial Yellow Great Yin is the Limitless of the earthly realm, and the Lord of the Earth is its Supreme Ultimate. The Human Yellow Cinnabar Gate is the Limitless of the human realm, and King Pan Gu is its Supreme Ultimate. Moreover, within the myriad things, each possesses its own Supreme Ultimate—without profound understanding of the Dao, one cannot speak of this.

The Master said: Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, when not deviating from correctness, do no harm to the Dao—provided their expression is fitting and not perverse.

The Master said: The Thunder Ancestor is the Limitless of the Nine Palaces of Divine Empyrean. The Nine Palaces are the nine qi of thunder. The Nine Offices are the residual qi of the Nine Palaces.

The Master said: The Hua Lin Eight Hundred Caves of Mount Fu Yun in Fengxin County were established for the Eight Hundred Disciples of Dragon Sands—this is the grand assembly of the Eight Hundred Perfected. The cave’s master is the Most High Lord Lao, now called Perfected Lord Li, or Li the Eight Hundred. Some say he travels eight hundred li in a day and lives eight hundred years—these claims are false. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, this cave has existed to await the future ranks of immortals.

The Master said: The popularly transmitted *Stone Casket Record*, *Golden Lock Record*, and *Drunken Thoughts of an Immortal Song*—all such works are not the authentic writings of the Perfected Lord. The Perfected Lord’s true teachings invariably elucidate the Dao of loyalty and filial piety; let scholars examine this carefully.

The Master said: After disciples receive the transmission, they must uphold filial sincerity and submit a register of their unnamed ancestors from past generations to their master for deliverance. Alternatively, they may practice the refinement methods themselves—this too is a way of repaying one’s origins. Details are found in the *Yiyang Refinement and Deliverance Method*.

The Master said: Our Pure Illumination Great Teaching reveals to people the principle of simplicity and ease, yet they still find it difficult. How profound is the obscurity of the Dao! Those who study the Dao must firmly believe in their hearts; even the slightest doubt will obstruct attainment. If one remains confused oneself, how can one enlighten others? To receive the Dao from Heaven yet fail to preserve it, or to preserve it yet fail to practice it, is to abandon Heaven. To humble oneself in pursuit of fortune from its words, or to sell oneself to peddle its teachings, is to profane Heaven. To abandon or profane Heaven is to turn one’s back on the Dao. Let all my Dharma disciples take heed and be cautious.

*Questions and Answers with the Master of the Central Yellow*

Should one ask: "For those who serve the Dao, maintaining dignified conduct in their dwelling, observing fasts and ablutions, and revering incense and sacred flames—may this be called purity?"

I answer: I have heard from my master that purity means not being stained by things. What you describe pertains only to outward purity of appearance. Yet true purity must also be sought within, for only then can one achieve the cultivation of both inner and outer. In essence, there is no other teaching—simply to eliminate desire is to be pure. When wicked and perverse thoughts are removed from within, outwardly there will be no unvirtuous conduct. As the ancients said: "To rid the entire body of branches and leaves, first strike at the root with a blade." Next, one must curb anger. In my humble view, anger is merely another form of desire, for it arises from stubborn insistence on one’s own way—what else is this if not desire? Refining and sifting until one reaches a state of desirelessness, one attains impartiality. Impartiality gives rise to clarity, hence it is said: "When desire is purified, principle becomes clear." Yet observing people, I see that those entangled in self-interest find the principles in their hearts suddenly obscured. They may even argue with others, claiming, "I am impartial," unaware that the multitude sees them as partial. If only I myself declare my impartiality, how can that suffice? How can the heart willingly affirm it? Some, though convinced of their own impartiality, often act with excess in their conduct, speak without restraint, and—what the common folk call "lacking conscience"—render the name of impartiality distasteful. Even if they do not covet profit, they covet reputation. Others feign impartiality to serve private ends—none of this accords with the Way of the sages or the will of Heaven. Overuse and prolonged indulgence in such ways will eventually bring unfavorable consequences upon oneself. How much better to meet events and things with a calm heart and settled qi, speaking words of impartiality, so that others naturally stand in awe and refrain from wrongdoing. Yet any trace of affectation is unseemly. If one can guide with skillful means and transform through principle, one conserves much qi, aligns with the will of Heaven, and—being free of desire—is pure. This is especially worthy of belief. Only when one reaches this point may one be said to have attained purity.

Should one ask: "In encountering affairs and engaging with others, if one clearly discerns good and evil, uprightness and perversity, right and wrong, truth and falsehood—may this be called clarity?"

I answer: I have heard from my master that clarity means not being obstructed by things—these words carry profound meaning. What you describe is indeed clarity, yet it is not the utmost clarity. If one’s own cultivation involves penetrating this principle and simply practicing what is good, upright, right, and true, the Daoist disciple will certainly not err. But when dealing with others, if one penetrates their evil, perverse, wrong, and crooked aspects yet refuses to be swayed by them, one should not expose these too thoroughly—for to expose faults under the guise of forthrightness is itself a flaw. One ought instead to generate a heart of great compassion and pity, using skillful analogies to guide them back to the right path. If they do not heed, desist, and do not bring humiliation upon oneself. To be indignant and resentful toward the obstinate, attacking them to the utmost, is to cultivate enmity with them—what merit is there in claiming clarity? The enlightened of old said: "Those who are keenly perceptive and deeply observant yet near to death are those who delight in criticizing others. Those who boast grandly and endanger themselves are those who take pleasure in exposing others’ faults." Is this the way of the wise who preserve themselves? Such people may indeed see clearly in the present, but they do not see clearly into the future. Thus it is said: "Be wise and perspicacious, yet guard it with foolishness." Only when one reaches this point may one be said to have attained clarity.

Should one ask: "Having never held office, I have no opportunity to serve the ruler or benefit the people. Though I possess a loyal heart, where can it be applied?"

I answer: How can you speak thus? Does this mean that only those in office may devote themselves to loyalty? My master said: The heart is the ruler and master of the myriad spirits. A single deceitful thought is already disloyal. Generally, those in office should indeed act to serve the ruler and benefit the people. Yet even those not in office must ensure that every thought is free of self-deception and does not obscure principle. Most importantly, one must first refrain from false speech, as the former worthies said, to avoid being disloyal. Only when one’s cultivation reaches this point may one be said to have attained loyalty.

Should one ask: "In serving one’s parents, observing the rites of warming in winter and cooling in summer, attending to their rest at dusk and their rising at dawn, and providing for their bodily needs with utmost care—may this be called filial piety?"

I answer: This is but one aspect of the Way of filial piety. One must also know that there is an inner Way of filial piety that cannot be neglected. Generally, our bodies are the legacy of our parents. In all the twelve hours of walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, one must diligently protect and honor this legacy, ensuring no offense is given to the five viscera—only then may one be called perfectly filial. There are those whose hearts do not seek public-spirited loyalty, uprightness, benevolence, filial piety, health, and clarity, but instead, day and night, are preoccupied with cunning, deceit, treachery, malice, and a thousand ghosts and ten thousand demons, ever scheming to harm and betray others. This is to offend the heart-viscus. For such impure, crafty, and deceitful thoughts defile the numinous terrace. If one awakens and swiftly purges them, one may begin anew. Others, though their intentions are somewhat good, neglect the principles of health preservation, drinking without measure, slaughtering countless living beings, seeking exotic flavors without restraint, and thus inviting illness—this is to offend the spleen-viscus. Still others, overly indulgent in lust, waste their essence and extinguish their spirit, even to the point of losing their lives—this is to offend the kidney-viscus. Some, though their intentions are impartial and their desires moderate, harbor intense anger, constantly stirring their blood and qi beyond proper measure, even to the point of forgetting their bodily conduct in a moment of rage.

The *Canon* states: "Unrestrained anger clouds the mind and disturbs the eyes." Medical texts say: "Excessive rage injures the liver, for the lung governs qi, and metal (lung) restrains wood (liver), causing the liver to fail in storing blood—thus illness arises." This is to offend both the liver and lung viscera.

Generally, indulging in wrath, yielding to desire, or ignoring principle—these three harm all five viscera, but their damage to their respective organs is most severe. Those who offend the five viscera rupture their primordial qi, batter their own bodies, and fail to practice filial piety. Reflect quietly: parents give us life whole, yet we return to them whole only in speech—how often have we fallen short? Thus it is said: to avoid offending the five viscera is to fulfill filial duty.

Beyond this, one must master the art of restraint and release, preserving the "qi of the night," for this is to "turn inward and achieve sincerity"—no joy surpasses this. It is the work of returning to the moment of receiving qi at birth, and when cultivation reaches this point, it becomes the highest form of filial piety. Yet if one cannot nourish one’s parents, cannot rectify the heart, cannot cherish the body, but merely claims to have returned to the moment of receiving qi at birth and calls this filial piety, this is to abandon the human Dao in pursuit of the immortal Dao. The latter may not be assured, while the former is already offended. Know this: in the nine heavens above, there are no immortals who are impure, unenlightened, disloyal, or unfilial.

For those who attain purity, clarity, loyalty, and filial piety, scholars must strive further, for beyond these lie *true* purity, *true* clarity, *true* loyalty, and *true* filial piety—these must be known and practiced. To deeply understand the nature of being, unstained by even a speck of dust, stable in movement and stillness, unharmed in all dealings—this is *true purity*. To clarify the wellspring of the heart, like moonlight on ice or water, illuminating all phenomena, unified in waking and dreaming—this is *true clarity*. To offer no grain or sacrifice, but to take non-deception as one’s practice, reverently serving the Supreme Emperor with utmost care—this is *true loyalty*. To treasure and conserve primordial qi, deeply comprehend Heaven’s mandate, nurture the Dao-embryo, and continue the true lineage—this is *true filial piety*. One who upholds these without fail, perfectly embodying their form, may be called a *zhenren* (true person).

What is the meaning of *zhenren*?
It is answered: *Zhen* means utterly genuine, without falsity. *Ren* means distinct from birds and beasts. In the Teachings of Purity and Clarity, the *zhenren* is not one who achieves truth through breathwork, massage, fasting, or grain avoidance. Rather, it is one who curbs anger, restrains desire, reforms faults, cultivates goodness, illuminates principle, restores nature, and aligns with Heaven and Earth as the third pole—unashamed of the human Dao. This is a *zhenren*.

Question: "Perfectly embodying one’s form" is but a Confucian teaching, the work of cultivating the human Dao. Is this the same as or different from the essentials of cultivating the immortal Dao?
It is answered: Let me explain in detail. Generally, human life in Heaven and Earth is like a seal imprinting a mold, or like a lotus pod containing seeds, within which lie the lotus root and leaves—fully formed, though small. Now, the human head is round, symbolizing Heaven (one, the odd number of *qian* yang); all have one head. The feet are square, symbolizing Earth (two, the even number of *kun* yin); all have two feet. Mount Sumeru is the bone of Heaven and Earth, and humans have the spine to mirror it. The *niwan* palace atop the head resembles the Great Luo Heavenly Palace. The two eyes resemble the sun and moon. The triple burner resembles the Three Realms. The five viscera resemble the Five Peaks. The large and small intestines resemble rivers. The heart, with its seven orifices, resembles the seven stars. The Northern Dipper in the central sky is the convergence of the two qi and five phases, bestowed upon the human body as the nature of health and compliance with the Five Constants.

The navel below represents the wind-wheel and water-abyss. The bladder’s water exits in front, symbolizing water flowing to the southeast sea. The large intestine lies behind, symbolizing the gates of Fengdu facing north. As the classics say: Fengdu lies in the lower region of *gui*, amid the foul, murky, and dark sea—thus human prisons are designed with round gates, following ancient models. It is also said that Mount Fengdu is unlit by sunlight or moonlight, just as human eyes cannot see behind them. The human body, formed thus from yin and yang, resembles Heaven and Earth—how can one not hold oneself in reverence?

Let us speak first of the physical form. When sitting in stillness, one should straighten one’s attire, remain composed, hold the head and body upright, and sit as steady as an anchor. Then the whole body is tranquil, mirroring Heaven and Earth—how noble this is! But if one is frivolous, restless, slouching, or fidgeting, unable to sit still—how base this is! How can such a one aspire to "perfectly embody their form"?

Once the body is disciplined—walking upright, sitting upright, even sleeping upright—one should reflect that within this body lies the infinite truth, the essence of the two and five, wondrously conjoined and concentrated, never departing from the central yellow cinnabar chamber. To silently comprehend this Dao and steadfastly practice it is to fulfill one’s form.

Those who conduct themselves thus move and speak without obscuring their original nature, and their words carry primordial qi. What does it mean to not obscure one’s original nature? Every action is meaningful. What does it mean to carry primordial qi? The mouth never forgets the great central and supremely upright principle.

Question: What of those who disregard these words?

Those disciples who study the scriptures to clarify principle yet hear these words and fail to esteem and cherish themselves may be said to neglect their family legacy, or even to estrange themselves from it. How perverse the workings of creation! As Kangjie observed: "To know one has idly passed through death ten thousand times, yet remain as if never born at all." Yet creation does not truly exclude anyone—why? Observe those who follow principle: they naturally accumulate boundless fortune and virtue. Those who defy principle: they naturally endure endless sorrow and suffering. From this perspective, standing between heaven and earth, with Father Qian and Mother Kun, how can one not strive to fulfill one’s form and emulate their pattern?

Someone asked: Mencius said, "Of the three unfilial acts, the greatest is to leave no posterity." What of the principle of restraining desire?

The Daoist scriptures state: A person’s life at sixteen is spring; the next sixteen, summer; the next, autumn; the next, winter—altogether sixty-four years, corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams. In the years of spring and summer, one should embody the meaning of *yuan* and *heng*. *Yuan* is the beginning: primordial qi is undifferentiated, and one should protect it well. *Heng* is free flow: primordial qi circulates smoothly to nurture one’s descendants. This is like flowers blooming and leaves unfurling, akin to the time of rosy cheeks and black hair. Yet even so, one must avoid excess to prevent illness. Thus the ancients said: "In youth, restraint keeps the complexion fair; filial piety, though unnamed, rings true." These two lines carry profound meaning.

One must also rightly understand "ordering one’s household": this is called *proper desire*. Anything beyond this is *illicit lust*, also termed *conducting lewdness outside the Way*. Confucians call it transgressing ritual and violating prohibitions, defying statutes. In the scriptures of immortals and buddhas, it is deemed the gravest of evil deeds, leading to the fall into the wheel of rebirth.

*Proper desire* means continuing the human Dao, inheriting the ancestral line, and acting with meaning. *Illicit lust* is acting without meaning—mistaking suffering for joy, inviting illness or early death. All this stems from failing to honor the body bequeathed by one’s parents, thus falling short in filial duty. Moreover, it causes the spirit to daily sink into dark, filthy, and turbid realms, all unconsciously—truly pitiable!

The elders said: "Acting with meaning is a mind awakened; acting without meaning is a mind deranged." Those who remain clear and unconfused attain the proper human Dao; those who persist in madness scarcely remain human. If one treasures and guards primordial qi, by autumn it should gradually be gathered in. As the *Commentary* says: "Autumn is *ju*—the image of gathering and reaping." Plants wither and leaves yellow, just as a person’s hair and beard turn white. For plants, this is the time to return to the root and restore life. Primordial qi returns to its source, so that when spring arrives, vitality surges anew.

By the sixteen years of winter, one should deeply conceal and secure it, like frost descending, waters freezing, rivers icing over, and the earth hardening—hence the saying "autumn harvest, winter storage." How can humans be inferior to things? Generally, the ancient sages embodied heaven and followed the Dao, aligning with the sequence of the four seasons. In the cosmos, they moved without shame. Today’s scholars should act accordingly, and the Dao will not be far off.

Yet some, though advanced in years, continue to leak without cease, their primordial qi never returning to the root. Thus their spirit, swept along by the current, plunges into the cold courts of dark realms, where in endless night no sign of life appears—truly lamentable!

Someone asked: What of those who, in summer or autumn, have not yet established posterity?

There are indeed unavoidable cases where offspring come only in autumn or winter. Even then, one must practice restraint, ever mindful of the approaching twilight of life, avoiding reckless indulgence without scruple.

Another asked: To which season do the remaining years after the four seasons belong—spring or winter?

The Daoist scriptures say: The hexagrams’ numbers are complete, the spirit’s capacity is finite. Only by sustaining the qi of grain does one live—this is called *longevity in name*. After sixty-five, until the moment of death, it is nothing but the depths of winter, the end of the year. If in this life one indulges in anger and desire, perverting and obscuring principle, then the five—spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, intention, and vitality—all return to the yin, suffering various retributions, unable to be reborn in the human realm. Like rootless plants, though winter ends and spring returns, they bear no sign of life.

If in this life one curbs anger and restrains desire, never obscuring heavenly principle, then the five—spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, intention, and vitality—all abide in the light of yang. Life flourishes, and after the body perishes, one follows one’s merit and deeds, ascending to heaven or returning to the human realm—just as winter ends and spring immediately returns.

Someone asked: If a scholar, long parted from parents, seeks office a thousand miles away, using "establishing oneself and glorifying one’s name to honor one’s kin" as an excuse—can this truly be called filial?

Yang Cheng of the Tang, as Director of the National University, once addressed his students: "The purpose of study is to learn loyalty and filial piety. Are there any among you who have long failed to visit your parents?" The next day, twenty returned to serve their parents. Those who had not returned for three years were expelled.

Observing the teaching methods of these predecessors, they truly serve as a model. From this, we see that those who know only officialdom and neglect the care of their parents—how can this be called the Way of filial piety?

Someone asked: What is meant by "recommendation across the Three Realms"?

The answer: Scholars should always bear the two characters "loyalty" and "filial piety" upon their foreheads, ensuring their thoughts do not stray, their bodies do not act recklessly, and their words are not spoken carelessly. They must discipline themselves with strictness while treating others with generosity—this is what is meant by "harmonious yet not conformist, harmonious yet not adrift." Over time, people of the upper, middle, and lower ranks will naturally come to admire and trust them. In their speech, without need for deliberation, whatever they say will be believed. If one traces the root, it all arises from the power of sincerity. Once the three ranks of people trust you, heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, will also align with you—what worry is there of not attaining immortality?

Thus, it is said: When a Dao-seeking scholar has cultivated thirty percent of their effort, the heart of heaven will affirm it. When practicing methods, the methods will prove efficacious; when pursuing the Dao, the Dao will come to fruition. First, one must conduct oneself with perfect integrity; second, one must guard the Dao with perfect stillness; third, one must approach matters with perfect sincerity and reverence—then there will be no lack of response. Without these three, even if one travels to the ends of the earth and meets countless masters, one may only waste the years in vain.

It is also said: In the breast, one must have a bright mirror, for it can illuminate principles and actions without obscurity. One must also have a sharp sword, for it can decisively cut through affairs, leaving no room for doubt or hesitation. And one must have an official's steelyard, for it can discern weight and measure without the slightest error. Only with these three things can one safeguard their learning to reach the realm of sages, worthies, and immortals.

Someone asked: Does the Pure Brightness Dao value miraculous transformations?

The answer: The Great Dao is nameless, formless, and without emotion—thus it is said, "The ordinary mind is the Dao." It is also said: "Ten thousand auspicious signs are not as good as none; ordinary peace and stability accord with the Dao." Scholars should simply practice and uphold it, cultivating purity and clarity, loyalty and filial piety. Over time, when they attain true purity, true clarity, true loyalty, and true filial piety, their sincerity will move the heavens, and they will naturally achieve success—performing transformations, wielding the powers of ghosts and spirits. Though every intention manifests thus, they never lose their right mindfulness, and their Dao is supreme. The so-called supernatural and strange matters of the world are not what we esteem.

Someone asked: Do the causes and effects of sin and blessing exist?

The answer: There is no need to broadly cite the scriptures of immortals or the teachings of Buddhism; we may simply speak from the Confucian classics: "Doing good brings a hundred blessings; doing evil brings a hundred misfortunes." "The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant fortune; the family that accumulates evil will surely have abundant misfortune." "Words that are perverse in going out will be perverse in returning; wealth that is perverse in coming in will be perverse in going out." "Beware, beware! What comes from you will return to you." This is precisely the cause and effect of sin and blessing. Thus, the early Confucians said: "Between heaven and earth, there is only this mutual resonance of stimulus and response." It is also said: "The vast emptiness is filled with nothing but this principle." In this way, the Way of stimulus and response is clearly evident.

Generally, when people do good, it is like sowing the seeds of the five grains—clearly, one reaps in autumn what one sows in spring. When people do evil, it is like bending a bow and entering battle—there will certainly be a retaliatory arrow. Yet those of the highest rank will never transgress; those of middling capacity only remember the blow after being struck; and the foolish and benighted remain entirely unaware.

Someone asked: Are there cases where doing good or evil goes unrewarded?

The Master replied: Only when the fruit ripens does the stem fall—do not marvel that it has not fallen before ripening. As the poem by a former sage says:
*When winter departs, the ice must melt;
When spring arrives, the grass grows of itself.*
Observe this principle, and the Way of Heaven is perfectly clear.

Someone asked: Were the Twelve Perfected Lords Xu and Wu, who cultivated the Dao of immortality, all reclusive adepts who left the household life?
The Master answered: According to the *Biographies of Immortals*, the Perfected Lord Xu of the Capital was diligent in study from youth, mastering the classics and histories without seeking fame or office. His village was transformed by his filial piety and fraternal kindness, and his associates admired his virtue and righteousness. Though nominated as a *Filial and Incorrupt* candidate by his prefecture, he declined. The Jin court repeatedly offered him official appointments, and in the first year of *Taikang* (280 CE), he was appointed magistrate of Jingyang County in Shu Commandery. Lord Wu served as magistrate of Xi’an County in Wu, which is now part of Fenning. His nature was profoundly filial. Lords Chen and Zhou were both scholars from eminent families. Lord Gan was a commoner from the wilderness. Lord Shi was originally a village warrior, unmatched in archery and swordsmanship. Lord Peng was nominated as a *Filial and Incorrupt* candidate and later rose to Left Assistant in the Imperial Secretariat under the Jin. Lords Xu, Zhongli, and Zhongli were nephews of the Perfected Lord of the Capital. Lord Huang was his son-in-law and served as an aide in Qingzhou. All of the above were practitioners who cultivated the Dao while remaining in the household life. Only Lords Zeng and Shi became Daoist priests (*huangguan* adepts) from youth, yet both attained perfection by emulating the teachings of filial piety. From this, we see that the Dao is realized through inner awakening, and the mysterious is attained through profound verification. Those who receive its transmission are not bound by whether they remain in the household or leave it—so long as they possess resolve and integrity, none fail to achieve success. How much more so for the Two Lords of Sun and Moon, who transmitted the *Pure Brightness* teaching of loyalty and filial piety, which does not require abandoning human relationships, forsaking social norms, or cutting ties with the world? Even our teacher, Master Yuzhen, encountered the Perfected Lord of the Capital while still living as a layperson. Scholars should not distinguish between the Way and the secular—strive on, strive on!

Someone asked: If the Perfected Lord of the Capital was an incarnation of the Supreme Yang Emperor, why did he not attain greater prominence during his official career in the Jin dynasty, being nominated only as a *Filial and Incorrupt* candidate and appointed a county magistrate?
The Master replied: Generally, those who attain the Dao and become perfected beings possess divine transformations and unfathomable concealment or manifestation, unbound by the rank of their official positions. As Ge Zhichuan’s *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: Laozi was the essence and spirit of Heaven, appearing in every age. For example, during the Three Sovereigns’ era, he was the *Master of the Mysterious Center*; in the time of the Yellow Emperor, he was *Guangchengzi*; during King Wen’s reign, he served as *Keeper of the Archives*; and under King Wu, he became *Keeper of the Pillars*. Similarly, the Emperor Lord of Zitong was born during King Xuan of Zhou’s reign as the minister Zhang Zhong, renowned for his filial piety and fraternal kindness. The Supreme Dark Heaven Emperor appeared during the Song dynasty as a general before Marshal Di, manifesting the forms of a tortoise and serpent—thus, he transformed into a military leader. The Perfected Lord of Pure Yang, born in the Tang dynasty, was merely a *jinshi* scholar, yet after attaining the Dao, he claimed his former life was as the *Celestial Inspector of the Nine Heavens*. Indeed, the sages and worthies often resemble what is described in the esoteric teachings: having already attained the fruit of the Dao, they re-enter the world of toil to relinquish their rank and save sentient beings. How could ordinary people fathom this?

Someone asked: The *Recorded Sayings of Yuzhen* describes the iron pillar as the essence of the earth welling forth. Why then do traditional paintings and accounts depict it as the result of commanding ghosts and spirits, with laborers working to erect it? There must be some basis for this.
The Master replied: Such matters in the world are full of twists and turns, but one must delve into the wonders of the Dao, encompassing all things with wisdom, to discuss them. According to the esoteric teachings: Consider a single meal set before four kinds of beings—deities, humans, hungry ghosts, and animals—each perceives it differently, for their perceptions follow their karmic fortunes. The gods see it as ambrosial delicacies; humans see it as ordinary food; hungry ghosts consume it as fire and burning coals; and beasts eat it merely to sate hunger, finding no flavor. Thus, all mountains, forests, houses, boats, and carriages appear differently to these four kinds of beings. It is also said: The waters of the Ganges appear as waves to humans, but to ghosts burdened with heavy karma, they appear as smoke and flames. Old records of thunder scriptures describe three kinds of imprisoned ghosts, all of whom were ordinary people whose sins after death condemned them to these fates. The first kind *hauls rainclouds*, drawing water upward to assist dragons in producing rain. The second *draws from the deep*, commonly called *tide-pushing ghosts*. The third *gathers firewood to boil springs*, referring to hot springs. From a human perspective, rain falls from the sky, tides surge from the sea, and hot springs emerge from the earth—how could there be such labors? Yet in the unseen realm, this is what they perceive.

When the iron pillar welled forth from the earth, the Perfected Lord of the Capital was resting in the realm of true purity and wondrous clarity, and it required only a slight thought. For at the time of attaining the Dao and protecting beings, conditions naturally arose in this way. This is the state described by Guan Yinzi as *the Dao has no ghosts or spirits, moving alone and coming alone*. In this teaching, it is called *profoundly entering the learning of the true, pure, and wondrously clear mind*. Yet to the eyes of ordinary people at the time, they naturally saw many ghostly laborers at work—hammers, bellows, and anvils, all manner of tools present. As for beings like karmic dragons, flood dragons, and *shen* spirits, they saw the iron pillar and iron chains restraining and binding them, so tightly secured that they dared not move in the slightest. There is no other reason: the man of the Dao’s mind is empty, luminous, and subtly wondrous, so his perceptions are naturally light and pure, free from the many coarse and heavy disturbances. Even when he acts, it is as if the spirit moves and Heaven follows—merely a bubble rising in the sea of his nature. But for ordinary beings like flood dragons and *shen* spirits, their karmic burden is thick, so their perceptions are naturally coarse, heavy, foul, and turbid, and thus many realms manifest before them.

Thus do the lofty perfected and exalted immortals often point to such beings as those deluded in seeing and deluded in hearing. Given this, how could the transmissions among people fail to become mere painted images?
