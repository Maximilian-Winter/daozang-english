**The Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Treatise on the Left Mystery**

**Scripture Title:** *The Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Treatise on the Left Mystery* (Abbreviated as *Treatise on the Left Mystery*). The author is unknown, likely composed between the Sui and Tang dynasties. It serves as a commentary on a lost Daoist scripture. According to quotations in *The Three Caverns’ Pearl Satchel* (Volume 7), the original text should have contained at least thirteen chapters. Only the fourth and fifth chapters remain, divided into four scrolls.

**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (Taiping Section).

### *The Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Treatise on the Left Mystery, Scroll One*

#### **Chapter Four: The Vision of the Adamantine of the Supreme Dao of the Perfectly Real, Peerless, and Supreme Immortal**

That which is not deviant is called *upright*; that which is without admixture is called *real*. When the bonds of the Three Realms are extinguished for the Heavenly Worthy’s great fruit, and the delusions of the Four Views are severed, the body is free from deviation and admixture—hence it is called *perfectly real*.

*Peerless* signifies the utmost perfection, beyond which no dharma can surpass—hence it is called *peerless*. *Supreme Immortal* clarifies that while immortals are manifold, this immortal is the highest among them, not one of the lesser immortals.

An alternative explanation: *peerless* is an absolute term, for it encompasses the unfathomable and transcends all limits, its meaning reaching the highest extreme—hence it is called *peerless*. If one were to speak only of *peerless*, there might be those who misconstrue it as comparable; in discourse, there could be an implied inferior. To reinforce the preceding phrase, it is thus further clarified as *supreme immortal*.

The term *adamantine* has five meanings:
1. **Earthly Adamantine**: Located beneath the nine directions, amidst the seventy-two marshes, where there are marshes of various adamantines—this is called *earthly adamantine*.
2. **Treasure Adamantine**: Such as the myriad precious treasures before and after the Ten Vehicles, within and beyond the Three Realms—this is called *treasure adamantine*.
3. **Divine Adamantine**: Such as the gods of the Three, Five, and Eight Struggles—this is called *divine adamantine*.
4. **Sages of the Ten Vehicles** possess the wisdom to sever [delusion], also named *sharp-wisdom adamantine*.
5. The **great fruit of the Heavenly Worthy** is called *firm-fruit adamantine*.

What is expounded here is precisely *firm-fruit adamantine*, not the earthly, treasure, or divine adamantines.

*Adamantine* derives its name from analogy: though the outer appearance of ore may lack luster, the essence of gold or purple emerges when branches are carved and stones are engraved—thus it is called *sharp*. Its body is indestructible—hence it is called *firm*.

Internally, the great fruit of the Heavenly Worthy’s ground is replete with wisdom; its body is sharp and its virtue real—likened to gold. The Three Realms cannot overthrow it, the Four Views cannot impair it—it is steadfast and solid, thus called *firm*. It perceives the boundless and observes the most obscure—hence it is called *vision*.

**How does my master attain the peerless master?**
*I* refers to the author of this treatise. *Master* points to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity.

What is meant by *my master*? Attaining the fruit of non-action is the result of learning from the peerless master.

As for the Dharmakāya Heavenly Worthy, in principle, there is no cultivation or learning. As for the Reward-body Heavenly Worthy, there is cultivation and practice—such as the Heavenly Worthies of Joy, Purity, and Faith, who are Reward-body Heavenly Worthies.

In principle, the Heavenly Worthy should have no master. Yet here, to encourage learners, it is clarified that all true immortals and great sages have masters. Thus, the scriptures say, *"The great Dao’s master is mystery and quiescence,"* and *"The Dao’s dharma is spontaneity"*—this is the meaning of *master*.

**Attaining the peerless dharma from the master, it becomes the origin of the myriad immortals.**
The *peerless dharma* refers to the Thirty-Six Sections of Scriptures. The *peerless cause* refers to the wisdom-cause of the Seventeen Holy Vehicles.

Though it is not yet the peerless, it is called *peerless* because it can lead to the great fruit of the peerless Heavenly Worthy—hence it is named the *peerless cause*. The *peerless fruit* is the great adamantine fruit, beyond which nothing can surpass—thus it is the origin and lord of the myriad immortals.

**Pure, luminous, immaculate, and harmonizing with virtue.**
The great fruit of the Heavenly Worthy is free from all delusive hindrances—hence it is called *pure and luminous*. It is without defilement—hence it is called *immaculate*. Liberated from bondage, it is thus *unobstructed and free*.

*Joy* refers to tranquility and delight, signifying the constant virtue within the fruit, unmoved by disturbance. *Stillness* refers to the practice of serenity and restraint in the cause, and the virtue of serene stillness in the fruit—thus it harmonizes with emptiness and completes the original destiny, unaltered by impermanence.

**Perfect and foremost, like unto emptiness.**
Its merits are perfect, without equal—hence it is called *perfect*. Its wisdom is complete, without comparison—hence it is called *foremost in wisdom*. These merits and wisdom pervade the ten directions, like emptiness without bounds—hence it is said to be *like unto emptiness*.

**The Dao that is king... the twenty-five natures, forms, and numbers.**
The term *Dao* is universal—even the Five Paths, the Northern Emperor, and ghosts and spirits are called *Dao*. This clarifies that the adamantine Dao is not such a Dao.

The paths of humans, heavens, and hells take good and evil as their karmic basis, or disperse them as supporting conditions, giving rise to rebirth in the human or heavenly realms. The adamantine Dao, however, takes good understanding as its fundamental cause and stillness as its supporting condition, giving rise to the adamantine—thus the adamantine Dao is not these paths.

**Accomplishing the immeasurable... the origin of all virtues.**
*Accomplishing the immeasurable* means that the great adamantine fruit’s immeasurable wisdom is fully realized—hence it is called *accomplishing the immeasurable*. This wisdom is not within the perception of humans, heavens, immortals, or sages—hence it is called *profound and mysterious wisdom*. As its wisdom is perfected and its insight deep, it becomes the origin and lord of all virtues.

**The Four Delusions are severed, and the virtue of wisdom is complete.**
The *Four Delusions* are the delusions of the Four Views. The delusions of the Four Views oppose the path of wisdom. If delusion is not severed, the body of wisdom is obstructed, and the virtue of wisdom cannot be complete.

When the Four Delusions are severed, the body of wisdom is unobstructed—thus the virtue of wisdom is complete. *The Four Delusions are extinguished and emptied, so the virtue of wisdom is complete.* In the *Great Treatise*, "severing" and "extinguishing" are often treated as similar, yet upon closer examination, they differ: "severing" implies the substance remains, while "extinguishing" implies the substance ceases to exist. For instance, when an object is severed, though cut, its substance still exists; when extinguished, it must return to nothingness. Since wisdom governs severing, and delusion is what is severed, the completion of the virtue of wisdom means that extinguishing must return to emptiness—hence it is said that *emptiness completes the virtue*.

*The Four Delusions lose their support, so the virtue of stillness is complete.* The support of the Four Delusions refers to restlessness and distraction, which arise from attachment to the Four Delusions. Once the Four Delusions are extinguished, restlessness and distraction also perish—hence it is said that *the Four Delusions lose their support*. *The virtue of stillness is complete* because distraction inherently opposes stillness. If restlessness and distraction persist, the virtue of stillness cannot be complete; once they are extinguished, the virtue of stillness is fulfilled.

*The Four Delusions lose their branches, so the virtue of precepts is complete.* The branches of the Four Delusions are evils, while precepts are goodness. Goodness and evil are mutually dependent; if evil exists, the virtue of goodness cannot be complete; if evil is absent, the virtue of goodness is fulfilled.

*The Four Delusions lack divergent causes, so the virtue of constancy is complete.* When the Four Delusions moisten goodness, they lead to rebirth among humans and heavens; when they moisten evil, they lead to the three wretched destinies. Being moistened by them, the cause of rebirth is called a *divergent cause*, and the resulting fruit is called a *divergent fruit*. If one is not moistened and moved by the Four Delusions, the causes and fruits of the five destinies become the *fruit of constancy*—hence it is said that *the virtue of constancy is complete*.

*The virtue of bliss is complete... all immeasurable and boundless virtues are fully realized.* This explains that having attained the fruit of constancy, one can fully realize all virtues of meaning. Since there is no suffering in this fruit, *the virtue of bliss is complete*; since there is no delusion or defilement, *the virtue of stillness is complete*; since it encompasses all, *the virtue of greatness is complete*; since it governs all, *the virtue of sovereignty is complete*. *All immeasurable and boundless virtues* is a general term for the full realization of all virtues. Why is this so? *Formerly, in the nine destinies, universally benefiting all beings*—this is the summary. Why are all these myriad virtues fully realized? Because when the sage dwells among the nine destinies, they cultivate the supreme practice, universally bestowing compassion and pity upon all beings—thus all virtues are fulfilled. *Through compassion, they enter the contemplation of emptiness.* This explains that those of the Great Vehicle first cultivate compassion, then develop the wisdom of emptiness regarding conditioned existence, and afterward enter the contemplation of emptiness. *Through the contemplation of emptiness, they enter compassion.* This explains that those of the Small Vehicle, unable to broadly practice compassion, merely cultivate the four practices of faith in emptiness and the like until old age. Finding their practice insufficient and unable to enter the true vehicle, they suspend their practice of emptiness and instead cultivate compassion from the contemplation of conditioned existence. *This is the difference in meaning between the Great and Small Vehicles.* This summarizes the practices of the Great and Small Vehicles. *The difference in sequence* refers to the Great Vehicle practicing compassion first and then entering the contemplation of emptiness, while the Small Vehicle practices emptiness first and later cultivates compassion—hence the difference in sequence.

*When practicing the contemplation of compassion, one regards parents, spouse, and children as equal.* When practicing this contemplation of compassion, one should see all phenomena as utterly equal, without distinction. One does not see the wealthy and noble as superior nor the poor and lowly as inferior; one does not see the near as close nor the distant as far; one does not see parents, spouse, and children as intimate nor enemies as estranged.

*If someone kills my parents, spouse, or children... the nature of compassion remains.* According to external teachings, one does not share the same heaven with the slayer of one’s parents, the same country with the slayer of one’s siblings, nor does one turn one’s weapons against the slayer of a friend. But in the internal teaching, it is not so: even if someone kills my parents, siblings, or spouse, I must regard them with a compassionate heart, never altering my benevolent and compassionate nature. Not only do I generate compassion, but I also perceive that they have compassion toward me.

*So-called "compassion sees"... opposing wisdom and joy.* Anger is a specific delusion, while joy is a specific wisdom—wisdom and delusion oppose each other. When the delusion of anger arises, the wisdom of joy is concealed; when the wisdom of joy arises, the delusion of anger is subdued—hence they are said to oppose each other. *When anger arises during joy... the delusion of anger becomes strong.* If the delusion of anger arises during a time of joy, it is restrained by the wisdom of joy and becomes weak; if it arises during a time of anger, the delusion of anger becomes strong.

*Just as the nature of water is moistening... the contemplation of compassion toward beings is likewise.* Just as the nature of water is moistening, and moistening water is easy while moistening fire is difficult, so too is the contemplation of compassion toward beings: compassion toward the compassionate is easy, while compassion toward the envious and jealous is difficult. *When compassion sees beings... this is truly called compassion.* If one sees beings as they are—with distinctions of high and low, noble and base—and calls this compassion, it is not so. Only when one sees beings with perfect equality, regarding them as no different from one’s own kin, can this be called true compassion. *The practices of compassion and joy are likewise.* These two practices—compassion and joy—are like the contemplation of compassion: compassion toward the compassionate is easy, while compassion toward the cruel is difficult.

*When anger arises within joy... this is called compassion.* The explanations of compassion and joy do not differ from the previous ones. Compassion is a specific wisdom, while jealousy is a specific delusion—they oppose each other. *Through the cause of compassion, the great fruit of compassion... the sovereign of the ten thousand paths.* Through cultivating the cause of universal compassion in the causal ground, one attains the great fruit of compassion in the fruition ground—this is the fundamental cause and fundamental fruit. Yet it does not merely eradicate delusion in the fundamental fruit; it also gives rise to the wondrous fruits of emptiness, purity, unimpededness, constancy, bliss, self-mastery, subtlety, perfection, and sovereignty over the ten thousand paths.

Through the cause of compassion, one attains the fruit of compassion—sovereign over the ten thousand paths. Through the cause of compassion, one is able to realize the fruit of compassion. This, too, is the fundamental cause giving rise to the fundamental fruit. When one attains this, one also realizes the wondrous fruits of emptiness, purity, unimpededness, constancy, bliss, self-mastery, subtlety, perfection, and sovereignty over the ten thousand paths.

The cultivation of wisdom and virtuous conduct yields results akin to these. All practices of wisdom and virtue alike attain their fruits as do compassion and joy—each possesses its fundamental cause that gives rise to its fundamental fruit, and each further draws forth the manifold wondrous fruits.

At that time, a great immortal—when such discourse was being held—spoke thus, wishing to pose a question. The time refers to the moment of this discussion. At that time, there was a great immortal named the Perfected of the Three Heavens, who was none other than Celestial Master Zhang, having attained the Dao and been enfeoffed with the title "Perfected of the Three Heavens," hence called the Perfected of the Three Heavens. In making this statement, he sought to raise a query. The Dao Lord refers to the master of the discourse. The meaning of "first subtle and wondrous great immortal king" is the supreme Celestial Worthy, the Vajra Great Fruit. "May I be permitted to see?" is a humble expression, asking whether his request may be heard.

At that time, the Dao Lord replied, saying: "I only wish that you may expound, so that all beings in every age may hear, know, and awaken." Then the Perfected of the Three Heavens, having grasped the meaning of what the Dao Lord had previously said, declared that all arises from the fundamental cause of compassion giving rise to the fundamental fruit of compassion. When the fruit of compassion arises, it is said to arise from the cause of compassion, not from any other source. This applies likewise to joy and the rest. Even to joy and the other wisdoms, it is said that each arises from its own fundamental cause, not from any other source.

Yet it is said that compassion and joy do not give rise to the wisdoms of diligence and reverence. The wisdoms of diligence and reverence arise from their own fundamental causes, not from the causes of compassion or joy. How then can it be said that through the cause of compassion one attains the fruit of compassion and further realizes the wondrous fruits of emptiness, purity, and the rest? The cultivation of wisdom and virtuous conduct likewise attains such fruits. If compassion does not give rise to diligence, then neither does it give rise to emptiness and purity. Here, the wondrous fruits are being questioned in relation to the fundamental cause.

The Exalted One replied, again employing humble language. That which is called "cause" is like a mother or a root—what gives birth is the mother, and what abides in the origin is the root. Just as a tree, having a root, gives rise to its trunk, then branches, fruits, flowers, and seeds, all interconnected. Now, taking compassion as the cause, it gives rise to the fruit of compassion and further generates the boundless wondrous fruits of emptiness, purity, and the rest. This applies likewise to joy and the rest—even to joy, diligence, reverence, and all others, each arises from its fundamental cause to realize its fundamental fruit and further generates the manifold wondrous fruits, no different from compassion.

The power of cause has two aspects, and also three. First, the power of the cause of compassion gives rise to the fruit of compassion. Second, it gives rise to constancy. Third, it gives rise to bliss. With boundless power, it gives rise to boundless wondrous fruits. One interpretation holds that the first is the cause of compassion, the second is the fruit of compassion, the third is the realization of constancy, and the boundless is the realization of boundless virtue. The old interpretation attributes the attainment of the fruit of compassion to the latter part of the text; the present interpretation aligns it with the preceding sentence, and the same applies to the following two sentences. Why is this so? Because one has realized the fruit of compassion.

In the old interpretation, compassion is named "universal kindness," and the Dao is termed "pervasive elimination." The Dao in the cause is pervasive, and the Dao in the fruit is likewise pervasive. The compassion in the cause is universal kindness, and the compassion in the fruit is also universal kindness. The present interpretation does not follow this. Compassion, being universal kindness, is able to give rise to the fruit of constancy, just as the Dao, being pervasive elimination, is able to give rise to the fruit of constancy. The reason this is so lies in the attainment of the corresponding fruit.

Compassion is named for constancy, just as the empty vehicle is named for diligence. In the old interpretation, compassion is named "universal kindness," and constancy is likened to stability, as a vehicle is for conveyance, and diligence is the driving force. In the present interpretation, because the cause of compassion gives rise to the fruit of constancy, the fruit of constancy is named for compassion, just as diligence nurtures the realization of emptiness, and thus the empty vehicle is named for diligence.

This interpretation holds that the nature of compassion is to oppose the delusion of jealousy. Where there is the delusion of jealousy, the wisdom of compassion does not arise; where there is no jealousy, it may be called compassion. Having the mind of compassion, one is able to cherish and love. Even in the Vajra Great Fruit, compassion is present, and cherishing love is all the more abundant.

In its nature, it is free from distraction, hence it is called "tranquility." Distraction is the delusion of restlessness, which obstructs the path of tranquility. Where restlessness is present, concentration cannot be achieved; only where restlessness is absent can it be called tranquility. Tranquility aids the wisdom of compassion, thus the power of the cause becomes robust, and it is named the "wondrous cause." From the robustness of the power of cause, the Vajra is realized, and it is named the "wondrous fruit."

Where the arising gives rise to the Vajra, it abides as the Vajra King. Having realized the Vajra, both yin and yang dissolve away, hence it is called "eternal absence"; with defilements present, it is called "pure absence"; capable of bondage and fetters, it is called "self-mastery"; encompassing all, it is called "King." It is also like the Three Realms—hence the tyranny. The wisdom of compassion subdues the delusion of tyranny. The beings of the Three Realms and Nine Paths are only tyrannical because they lack compassion.

Where there is distraction, it arises from robustness. Distraction is restlessness. Restlessness aids the delusion of tyranny, and upon hearing of good causes, the cause becomes robust. Since it is robust, the fruit arises accordingly, and the delusions of the Three Realms and Nine Paths also arise. Thus, the Three Realms and Nine Paths—those who are fully equipped. Ordinary beings, once the robust power of the cause arises, are deluded by the Three Realms and Nine Paths, subjected to impermanence, suffering, defilement, and bondage, unable to attain self-mastery. They constantly fear the demons of heaven, heterodox paths, and myriad calamities and trials, their minds flowing and scattering. Bound by these fetters, they are ordinary beings.

Then the Three Heavenly Perfected Ones spoke again: The Great Immortal, this wisdom is profound and abstruse, not something that shallow learners, minor immortals, or the beings of the Three Realms and Nine Paths can fathom. Though we have received your teaching, we still cannot fully comprehend these difficult-to-see and difficult-to-hear principles. We earnestly hope the Great Immortal will expound them further for all.

As we have always relied on our teachers to learn, and also through our own seeing and knowing, yet fear there may still be matters unknown and unseen, unobtained and unheard, we now must ask for your instruction.

How is it that the cause of compassion does not give rise to sorrow, and the cause of sorrow does not give rise to precepts, yet gives rise to the fruits of eternal bliss, emptiness, and purity, and so forth? The answer: Within compassion, there are two powers. The two powers and three powers do not differ from the previous explanation. Through the cause of my compassion, possessing these two powers, three powers, and even limitless powers, it can thus draw forth the original fruit and also bring about limitless fruits of meaning.

The two powers give rise to the virtue of compassion. The old explanation: the first power is the cause of compassion, and the second power is the fruit of compassion, hence it is said that the two powers give rise to the virtue of compassion. The present explanation: the first power can only give rise to a weak effect, while the second power gives rise to a strong one. Another explanation: with these two powers, only compassion is generated, not precepts, sorrow, or diligence. Why is this? Precepts, sorrow, and diligence each have their own original causes and are not produced through conditions.

Yet conditions can also give rise. As for the so-called "tranquility aiding the robust power of meaning," previously it was said that precepts, sorrow, and diligence are not produced through conditions, but now it is said that conditions can also give rise. This shows that the master’s discourse also has principles of opening and closing. The previous statement that they do not arise refers to precepts, sorrow, and the like having their own original causes. This statement that conditions can also give rise means that distant conditions can also mutually generate, such as cultivating compassion and sorrow while also practicing generosity. Such distant conditions can also be discussed in terms of mutual generation, though they are not direct causes and conditions.

Question: Does this robust power of meaning arise from the original cause, or does it arise from itself? Answer: The original cause, aided by purity and tranquility, becomes robust. From this robustness arises the cause of meaning, which can bring about the original fruit of the Vajra, called the "distinct fruit." The so-called "distinct fruit" refers to good deeds bringing about human or heavenly rebirth—these do not resemble their causes, hence they are called "distinct fruits." Evil deeds bring about the Three Wretched Realms, which also do not resemble their causes, hence they are also called "distinct fruits." Now, wisdom brings about the eternal, which does not resemble its cause, hence it is called the "distinct fruit." This cause arises upon the original cause, hence it is called the "cause of meaning."

Causes are of two kinds: eternal and impermanent. They differ due to what they follow. Tranquility aids wisdom, thus giving rise to the eternal; distraction aids delusion, and upon hearing of good and evil, gives rise to the impermanent, hence it is said they differ due to what they follow.

The fruit comes gradually. The fruit that comes gradually is that which distraction aids in good and evil, giving rise to the Five Paths. Impermanence is called "gradual manifestation," as today’s cause may become tomorrow’s fruit, hence it is called "gradual coming." The fruit comes suddenly. The fruit that comes suddenly is the eternal fruit. Eternity is called "sudden manifestation," as when impermanence is exhausted, the eternal fruit arises, hence it is sudden. It is that which tranquility aids in giving rise, hence it is called the "tranquil fruit."

The fruit of distraction is the fruit that distraction aids in giving rise to—it is the impermanent, impure, suffering minds of the beings in the Three Realms and Nine Paths. The tranquil fruit is the fruit that tranquility aids wisdom in bringing about. Self-mastery means being free and unburdened. "Vacuous wisdom-life" means wisdom uniting with emptiness to together accomplish the true life.

While in the position of the Nine Paths, it is called the "fruit of distraction," constantly coming as gradual retribution, giving rise to the Nine Paths, cycling endlessly. The Vajra’s self-mastery is obstructed by the Four Views. The great fruit of the Vajra is the realm of self-mastery and freedom, where all beings possess the nature to attain the Dao. However, they are obstructed by the Four Views and thus cannot ascend.

Thus, the eternal cause, pure cause, and so forth are stored within the Ten Vehicles but cannot be employed to reach the Vehicle of Non-Action. Only when the Vajra is realized can they be employed.

The Vehicle of Non-Action is where the myriad causes converge, hence it is called the "realm of complete causes." This transcends the Three Realms and severs the Four Views of inherent nature, which is why it is named Non-Action. To attain Non-Action is also called Non-Action.

The Tenth Vehicle of the Dao’s principle is not yet Non-Action, but as it can give rise to the later Non-Action Vajra’s great fruit, it is named Non-Action. This cause receives its fruit, and the fruit relies on the cause. The fruit of Non-Action is the state of Non-Action. The fruit of Non-Action is the Vajra’s great fruit, and this fruit is truly Non-Action. It is not that the fruit of Non-Action is Non-Action itself.

The power of this Non-Action fruit serves as the fruit, for the beings of the Three Realms and Nine Paths are born from Non-Action, hence named the fruit of Non-Action, yet it is not Non-Action itself. As the Nine Paths and Three Realms reach the cause of Non-Action, they are not Non-Action. It is clear that the Nine Paths and Three Realms are also the fruit of Non-Action, yet they are not Non-Action itself. Why is this? Though born from Non-Action and thus called the fruit of Non-Action, they are not the eternal, self-mastering Non-Action, but rather the cause of Non-Action, hence not Non-Action.

Non-Action has three kinds: first, Non-Action that is neither fruit nor cause; second, Non-Action that is both fruit and cause; third, Non-Action that is fruit but not cause. The first, which is neither cause nor fruit, is the Four Unobstructed Emptinesses—profound emptiness, profound void, profound clarity, and profound subtlety. Cause is that which draws, and fruit is that which responds; as emptiness has no drawing or responding, it is called neither cause nor fruit.

Yet it can also be the conditional cause and conditional fruit. Though emptiness is not the direct cause or direct fruit of the myriad things, it can serve as their conditional cause and conditional fruit. Why? It can give rise to the Three Realms and Nine Paths as a conditional cause, and when the Four Delusions of the Three Realms and Nine Paths are extinguished, it bestows its virtue upon emptiness, hence named the conditional fruit.

The second, Non-Action that is both fruit and cause, is the Tenth Vehicle of Non-Action. As fruit, it serves as the abode for the previous Sixteen Holy Vehicles. As cause, it serves as the direct cause for the Vajra’s great fruit. The Tenth Vehicle of Non-Action, where the myriad causes converge, is thus said to be complete in all contemplations.

Sudden contemplation is the original emptiness contemplation; gradual contemplation includes faith, coarse contemplation, and the like. Great contemplation is that cultivated by those of the Great Vehicle; small contemplation is that grasped by those of the Small Vehicle. Emptiness contemplation observes that all principles are empty and nothing inherently exists; existence contemplation, as previously discussed, touches upon emptiness even in emptiness, and now discusses existence as pervading emptiness. Fixed contemplation is constant contemplation; unfixed contemplation is non-contemplation. Auspicious contemplation is that which upholds the precepts; inauspicious contemplation is that which breaks them. Phenomenal contemplation is what the eye observes; principle contemplation is what neither eye nor mind illuminates. Internal contemplation observes the mind; external contemplation observes forms.

All contemplations arise from the contemplations of the "Birth" and "Dao" immortals, which are the contemplations of the Seven Immortals. "Birth" means that when wisdom of emptiness and forgetfulness first arises, it is called "birth." "Dao" means "to penetrate." When the contemplation of birth first arises, though emptiness and forgetfulness are present and wisdom has arisen, its power is weak and cannot yet subdue. In the contemplation of the Dao, wisdom’s power gradually strengthens and can slightly penetrate and subdue, hence called "Dao." Once subdued, the myriad contemplations arise.

Thus, all contemplations arise from the Birth and Dao immortals, and the Birth and Dao immortals give rise to the myriad contemplations. As for the Vehicle of Diligence, when the wisdom of emptiness and forgetfulness arises, it draws forth the later great fruit of Non-Action, hence it is now called Non-Action; as the gateway to the later great fruit, it is called the "fruit gateway."

Though the wisdom of emptiness and forgetfulness in the contemplation of birth has already arisen, it is now said that Non-Action only arises at the Vehicle of Diligence. This is because, though wisdom arises at the contemplation of birth, its power is weak and delusion enters its essence; at the Vehicle of Diligence, it can sever the essence of delusion, hence it is now called Non-Action.

This gateway—the Vehicle of Non-Action—is the gateway to the great fruit, and it gives rise to the later Vajra’s great wisdom, hence called the "cause gateway."

*End of the First Scroll of the* Left Mysteries of the Numinous Treasure
*Beginning of the Second Scroll of the* Left Mysteries of the Numinous Treasure

The Master of Merit and Virtue is none other than the Heavenly Worthy, whose merit and virtue are vast and lofty, serving as the teacher of the Nine Ways. With no entanglements of delusion, his essence is pure and his virtue immaculate, hence he is luminously radiant and unsullied. Free from all suffering and affliction, he abides in solitary liberation, thus he is ever blissful and self-mastered. His wisdom conjoins with the emptiness of space to form his body and life, hence he dwells in the realm of wisdom-life of emptiness. As the gateway that gives rise to the great Vajra fruit, he is called the "cause gateway."

The Three Non-Actions culminate in what is termed the Four Virtues of Emptiness. This third Non-Action is precisely the great Vajra fruit and not the cause gateway. This fruit conjoins in virtue with the Four Emptinesses, hence it is called the Four Virtues of Emptiness. These virtues are not of a different Way, thus the fruit does not possess the Four Emptinesses.

These virtues are the virtues of the great Vajra fruit. They are not attainable through the cultivation of heterodox Ways or miscellaneous immortals. Why is this so? Since miscellaneous immortals lack the Fourteen Contemplations, their fruit cannot conjoin with the Four Emptinesses.

The so-called Fourteen Contemplations—including internal and external contemplations—have already been fully enumerated earlier. They are reiterated here to clarify that miscellaneous immortals cannot cultivate these Fourteen Contemplations. The exposition remains consistent with the previous explanation.

Among these contemplations, whether perceiving the nature of form or the nature of formlessness, none accord with my intent. The term "contemplations" refers collectively to the insights elucidated in the preceding contemplations. "Contemplation" means to observe and examine all conditions; when one knows and names it, it is called contemplation. Regarding the nature of form and the nature of formlessness: in the Contemplation of True Unity, when form and emptiness are exhausted, it is termed the Contemplation of No Remainder. Yet form persists, hence it is again termed "form." Alternatively, in the Contemplation of Emptiness, when form is exhausted, it is termed "formless." However, since form arises from emptiness, if the contemplation fails to empty it, the root of form remains unseen, and thus it is still termed "form."

Whether perceiving the presence or absence of desire, none accord with my intent. "Presence" refers to the existence of desire; "absence" indicates that desire is subdued by the resolution of generosity. The term "absence of desire" means that the resolution of generosity has subdued desire. Yet to speak definitively of "presence of desire" is to acknowledge that desire arises from emptiness; though this resolution may temporarily subdue it, the root of desire remains unseen and unsevered, hence one is still said to possess desire. Regarding the presence or absence of anger: anger may be subdued by the wisdom of joy. To speak of "absence of anger" means that the wisdom of joy has subdued it; yet to speak definitively of "presence of anger" is to acknowledge that the root of anger remains unseen. Whether in internal or external contemplations, to speak definitively of presence or absence does not accord with my fundamental intent.

Why is this so? As with the Seventeen Holy Vehicles: when practitioners of the Seventeen Holy Vehicles engage in the Contemplation of Emptiness, they cannot definitively term it "empty" nor "non-empty." If they claim it is "non-empty," the contemplation of emptiness is directed toward an empty realm; if they claim it is "empty," form persists externally, and the fruit is not exhausted. One explanation likens this to desire and the like. Another states that to forget emptiness is not to speak of its presence; if emptiness is not empty, one must relinquish this emptiness. If one contemplates emptiness with the intent of emptiness or non-emptiness, this does not pertain to the practitioners of the Seventeen Holy Vehicles.

Furthermore, when engaging in the Contemplation of Form or internal and external contemplations, to fixate definitively on presence or absence is to lose my intent. Form is the realm of all existences; what precedes is the cause, and what follows is the fruit. One cannot definitively assert presence, for in contemplation, to assert the presence of form is to assert the absence of formlessness. Why is this so? Though one contemplates form as absent, the root of form remains unseen, hence it is still termed "form." Alternatively, though the cause of form is exhausted in emptiness, its fruit persists; the same applies to desire, anger, and the like. Thus, one cannot definitively assert presence or absence. To fixate definitively on presence or absence is to violate and lose my intent.

Why is this so? As when entering the First Vehicle’s Contemplation of Diligence: when the wisdom of Great Unity arises, it severs the root of the initial portion, hence it is termed "no perception." Yet the perception of the superior portion persists, hence it is again termed "perception." Therefore, one cannot definitively assert presence or absence.

Regarding all contemplations: "contemplation" means to observe and examine all preceding realms and phenomena; when one knows them, it is termed contemplation. The foremost among sentient beings refers to those of the sharpest faculties who grasp this sudden contemplation. Not observing great conditions through minor conditions means not proceeding step-by-step, as in emptying a foot with an inch or a yard with a foot. When the Contemplation of Great Conditions is accomplished, the Contemplation of Emptiness is perfected. It is said that one does not proceed step-by-step; without laborious comparison, one directly perceives that all myriad existences must arise from emptiness, temporarily exist apart from emptiness, are not eternally real, and must perish into emptiness. To observe thus is termed "sudden."

Minor conditions refer to the sentient beings of the Three Realms, Nine Ways, and Twenty-Five Natures, as well as form and the like; great conditions refer to the Five Emptinesses. Gradual contemplation: "gradual" denotes a step-by-step progression. The Five Emptinesses are coarse emptiness, wondrous emptiness, indeterminate emptiness, mutual emptiness, and fabricated emptiness. Unable to suddenly perceive these Five Emptinesses, one does not know that the sentient beings of the Three Realms, Nine Ways, and Twenty-Five Natures, as well as form, fundamentally arise from emptiness. Unable to grasp the root emptiness, one does not employ emptiness as the cause of the fruit. Instead, one sequentially investigates and contemplates within the realm of existence, hence it is termed "gradual."

Great contemplation: "great" refers to sentient beings of great nature, that is, those of sharp faculties in the Great Vehicle. The Seventeen Holy Vehicles comprise eight in the Desire Realm: first, the Vehicle of One Birth; second, the Vehicle of Two Ways; third, the Vehicle of Immortals; fourth, the Vehicle of Spirits; fifth, the Vehicle of Perfected Ones; sixth, the Vehicle of Illumination; seventh, the Vehicle of Elders; and eighth, the Vehicle of Diligence. In the Form Realm, there are three: first, the Vehicle of Combined Illumination; second, the Vehicle of Great Precepts; and third, the Vehicle of Full Mind.

In the Formless Realm, there are three: first, the Vehicle of Universality; second, the Vehicle of Pervasive Transformation; and third, the Vehicle of Dharma-Boundary. Beyond the Formless Realm, there are three: first, the Vehicle of Supreme Abode; second, the Vehicle of Subsequent Embodiment; and third, the Vehicle of the Unconditioned—hence they are termed the Seventeen Holy Vehicles.

To dissolve the four views: first, the view of inherent division; second, the view of superior division; third, the view of nature devoid of wisdom; and fourth, the view of exhaustive nihility.

The undying life: the life of ordinary beings is firm, while the life and body of the sage merge with emptiness in virtue, thus the body is not obscured by delusions nor altered by the cyclical shifts of yin and yang—hence it is called the undying life.

The great contemplation: beings of great nature perceive the decisive path of these Seventeen Holy Vehicles, desiring to cultivate and dissolve the four views, seeking to attain the adamantine realm of the undying life—hence it is termed "great contemplation."

The lesser contemplation: hence it is termed "lesser contemplation." The lesser contemplation pertains to those of the Lesser Vehicle. The great being sets the mind with compassion and mercy as foremost, responding to capacities and aiding without shunning hardship. Yet those of the Lesser Vehicle do not cultivate compassion, wisdom, or forbearance, but merely practice faith in emptiness, the six perceptions, and diligence—easy practices—abiding solely in the seventh vehicle of the Desire Realm, the Vehicle of Elders. Though their power and effort may reach the Formless Realm, they cannot contemplate the boundless emptiness of the Great One, sever the four views, and only suppress them—hence they are said to possess the four views. This implies that the duty of the Lesser Vehicle should not be merely thus, but rather a disparagement of their limited attainment.

The contemplation of emptiness: hence it is termed "contemplation of emptiness." One observes that all myriad existents are entirely empty, without a single dharma possessing inherent nature, yet not devoid of emptiness. For instance, the forms and appearances of the three realms, nine paths, and twenty-five natures, though distinct, are ultimately empty. Why is this so? Emptiness gives rise to existence, and existence originates from birth, thus existence ultimately returns to emptiness.

The contemplation of existence: hence it is termed "contemplation of existence." At first glance, in functional division, the manifold is existence, and quiescence is non-existence. Upon further inquiry, in the contemplation of emptiness and existence, the prior contemplation of emptiness isolates emptiness from existence; in the present contemplation of existence, existence pervades emptiness—hence both are termed "existence." It does not speak of "non-existence as non-existent," for one cannot assert the absence of this non-existence; if this non-existence were absent, non-existence would become an obstructive thing. Through such inquiry and examination, it is termed "contemplation of existence."

The contemplation of samādhi: hence it is termed "contemplation of samādhi." Samādhi signifies the meaning of perfect constancy, illuminating that the emptiness of the ancient past has never undergone change or movement. If any scripture or treatise claims that emptiness is subject to birth and death, such scripture or treatise does not originate from true wisdom. The same applies to the adamantine: the great fruit of the adamantine is also without birth and death; if it is said that the adamantine is subject to birth and death, it is likewise not true wisdom.

The contemplation of indeterminacy: hence it is termed "contemplation of indeterminacy." Indeterminacy signifies the meaning of impermanence; the three realms, nine paths, and twenty-five natures, along with all forms, are entirely imbued with impermanent temporal conditions, shifting in an instant, swiftly altering, now departing, now arriving—hence they are indeterminate. As for generating true wisdom according to the weight of afflictions and faculties: to generate true wisdom, one must follow the lightness or heaviness, superiority or inferiority, sharpness or dullness of faculties and afflictions. If the faculties are sharp, one must grasp the fundamental contemplation of emptiness; if the faculties are dull, one must grasp gradual and subtle contemplations. Observing according to one’s inherent capacity, one can perceive and illuminate auspiciousness.

Another explanation: when the faculty for generating true wisdom to illuminate things arises, it should accord with the greatness or smallness of the faculty. For those of great faculty, profound teachings are expounded; for those of lesser faculty, gradual teachings are imparted. Adapting to the disparity of faculties, all can be illuminated and known—hence it is said to follow forms and know accordingly. This is the transformation in response to faculties, hence termed "contemplation of indeterminacy."

The auspicious contemplation: hence it is termed "auspicious contemplation." Auspiciousness signifies true felicity, referring to the contemplation of upholding precepts. To cultivate and uphold the precepts is to gather auspiciousness and peace. As for "seeing": when there is a dharma to be seen, one examines and cultivates accordingly.

The Ten Sagely Safe Vehicles: the ten vehicles, which are the secure and peaceful vehicles of the middle way.

The six kinds of penetrating wisdom: the wisdom of the six penetrations that illuminate form.

The four internal practices: the four practices of equanimity that govern internal conduct.

The ten precepts: the ten precepts expounded in the great precepts.

The twenty-four precepts: the twenty-four precepts of true discipline as taught in the scriptures, which Laozi also possessed.

The boundless precepts: the one hundred eighty precepts, the three hundred great precepts, and the like.

The four treasuries of emptiness: merging virtue with the four formless realms. "Treasury" signifies the capacity to contain wisdom. Why is this so? Sentient beings are bound by the four delusions and cannot escape the cycle of birth and death.

If one cultivates these precepts, one can depart from the foul and defiled realms of birth and death, break free from the fetters of the four delusions, and arrive at the great adamantine fruit and the treasury of the four formless realms—hence this is called the Auspicious Contemplation.

The Inauspicious Contemplation is so named because it is inauspicious. "Inauspicious" denotes calamity and misfortune. This refers to the contemplation of those who do not uphold the precepts, for ordinary beings possess these various views—thus it is called the Inauspicious Contemplation.

The Perverse View inverts right and wrong, taking good for evil and affirming falsehood as truth, confusing square and round, mistaking blue for yellow.

The Evil View diminishes all things, lacks compassion and kindness, schemes for hellish outcomes, and causes the retribution of heavenly and human realms to regress—this is what is meant by evil.

The Deluded View is one of confusion and stagnation, where one is befuddled upon encountering circumstances—this is called delusion.

The Suffering View refers to all forms of anguish and torment, such as traversing forests of blades or thickets of swords, enduring the three trials of the body, or suffering the agony of a hundred poisons.

The Pleasure View refers to fleeting delight, for ordinary beings, enamored with illusory pleasures, construct the causes of suffering.

The View of Life: Beings of flesh and blood, valuing life excessively, fear the death of others while clinging to their own existence. Unable to contemplate life and death with equanimity, they become fixated on the cycle of birth and death—this is called the View of Life.

The View of Death: Death is departure. When form and mind separate, it is called death. At the moment of death, the spirit seeks to depart, blood and vessels sever, bones and flesh dissolve—this tearing asunder brings manifold pain. Ordinary beings dread this, hence it is called the View of Death. It also refers to conduct that deviates from the Dao, losing the primordial qi of life—thus it is called the View of Death.

The Boundless Contrary Views encompass innumerable kinds of views that oppose principle. Because of these views, beings are born into the restless realms of the three worlds.

The Contemplation of Principle is so named because of principle. Principle is the principle of the supreme great Dao, the true and abiding dwelling, which is also the dwelling of the great adamantine fruit. The gateway of causes refers to the ten transformations as the gateway of causes leading to the adamantine fruit. This gateway exists within and beyond the three realms, and thus it is known that the realm of the supreme Heavenly Worthy and the great adamantine fruit is not a gateway of causes. To reflect and examine in this way is called the Contemplation of Principle.

The Contemplation of Phenomena is so named because of phenomena. Phenomena refer to the objects of perception in the realm of causes. The Contemplation of Phenomena speaks only of the nine paths, twenty-five natures, and forms within the three realms, without addressing the true and abiding dwelling of the supreme Heavenly Worthy and the great adamantine fruit—hence it is called the Contemplation of Phenomena.

The Internal Contemplation is so named because of the internal. The adamantine is a term for firmness and constancy. It is said that all heterodox paths and miscellaneous immortals rely upon it as their mother—thus it is called the Mother of the Dao. The seventeen vehicles of wisdom and the four equal minds are all gateways of the mind, requiring little application of the body and hands—hence they belong to the internal. It is clear that when sentient beings cultivate the four equal wisdoms, they can skillfully restrain and prevent the arising of jealousy and envy in such circumstances, and they do not generate views of the various evil views.

The Non-View refers to the views of heterodox paths and miscellaneous immortals, which are views contrary to principle.

The Right View refers to the view that rightly affirms what is right.

The External Contemplation is so named because the internal contemplation contemplates the mind, while the external contemplation contemplates form. The mind contemplates principle—hence it belongs to the internal; the five roots perceive form—hence it belongs to the external. It is clear that all forms possess their own root-nature. Within this root-nature, one does not generate thoughts of attachment or movement toward external objects. One is highly capable of restraining all arising states: when the mind’s emotions arise and cling to external circumstances, one skillfully restrains and subdues them. To guard and protect means to guard the six roots and support the beings of the nine paths, preventing them from further entanglement with external objects—hence it is called the External Contemplation.

Regarding these fourteen contemplations: It is explained that these fourteen contemplations are the constant practices of the virtuous assembly of the seventeen sagely vehicles, cultivated for oneself and for others, with thoughts and reflections continuously following one another. For others, they guide beings to cultivate. For oneself, one contemplates: if one remains among the seven immortals, compassion is not constant. Thus, the scripture states: "Compassion may come or go." If one enters the ten vehicles, compassion becomes constant. Thus, thoughts arise continuously without interruption.

Even if the entire three realms were transformed into fire, or filled with the suffering of the nine dark hells—boiling and burning—the minds of those who abide in the seventeen sagely vehicles would remain unshaken. Why is this so? Because they have already eradicated the root of inherent views and entered the irreversible vehicle. Since this vehicle is securely and peacefully situated in the middle, there is no regression. The beings of the nine paths have no fear, and thus they are not tested or harmed by heavenly demons or heterodox paths.

The root of inherent views refers to the fundamental delusions. These fundamental delusions are the mother of the four views—hence they are called the root. Entering the first vehicle eradicates the fundamental delusions—thus it is said that the root of views is eradicated earlier.

Furthermore, they skillfully rescue and respond to all beings in the ten directions, transforming all into auspicious omens. It is explained that the virtuous assembly of the seventeen sagely vehicles is also adept at rescuing and responding to the perils and difficulties of all beings in the worlds of the ten directions, whether in heaven or on earth.

Beings in adverse circumstances refer to those in restless realms, such as when facing the end of life, being seized by corrupt officials or evil clerks, encountering plagues, curses, poisons, tigers, wolves, snakes, or vipers. When afflicted by nightmares, evil omens, or the fruits and causes of misfortune, if one can single-mindedly and carefully contemplate the virtuous assembly of the seventeen sagely vehicles and the supreme Heavenly Worthy, one will be rescued and delivered, and all evil circumstances will transform into auspicious omens. Why is this so? Because of the seventeen sagely vehicles, one is blessed and protected.

The original vow elucidates that the sage possesses an inherent vowing heart, vowing to deliver all beings. "Turning toward parents" signifies that for beings, it serves as a refuge and the destination of their initial aspiration—it is also the true parents of all things. Why is this so? All previous evil circumstances transform into auspicious omens precisely because the virtuous assembly of the seventeen sagely vehicles and the supreme Heavenly Worthy possess the power of compassionate original vows. Thus, if any being comes seeking deliverance, they will immediately receive blessings and protection.

In the first vehicle, one reaches the stage of the four views and their fruition. The first vehicle is the arising of insight. The initial arising of emptiness-view refers to the nascent arising of the wisdom of forgetting emptiness. "Initially encroaching upon the fruition of the four views" means that the fruition of the four views is the original portion yet to be realized, having departed from the obstructions of the seven immortals. This arising of insight initially subdues the unrealized portion of the four views, hence it is said that one initially encroaches upon the fruition of the four views. The principle of the arising of insight is not yet capable of subduing them; here, "subduing" merely serves to resolve the opposition or to explain the encroachment, speaking of it in terms of its portion.

"Compassionate mind may come or go, and compassionate view is likewise" clarifies that during the arising of insight, the power of wisdom is still weak, and subduing may not endure—now arising, now subduing, sometimes present, sometimes absent, with the function of compassion being inconsistent. Thus, it is said to come or go. "In the seven vehicles, emptiness-view and compassionate view are likewise" refers to compassionate view as the perception of compassion, and emptiness-view as the perception of the wisdom of forgetting emptiness. Among the seven immortals, those who attain a small portion of the principle of emptiness are called emptiness-view. It elucidates that within the seven immortals, the perceptions of emptiness and compassion are also exceedingly weak, unable to endure consistently, sometimes present, sometimes absent, with delusions coming and going.

Why is this so? Regarding emptiness-view: though it is covered and restrained, it cannot be without perception. "Perception of nothingness" refers to observing the emptiness of all principles, hence it is called the perception of nothingness. "Fruit-mother" refers to the original portion being the mother of delusive fruition. "Thus, the child constantly arises" means that the portions above and those yet to be realized are the children of delusion. "Covered and restrained" means suppression; it elucidates that within the seven and their stages, the mother of delusion being present, her children constantly arise. Though suppressed, one cannot be without the four views, hence emptiness-view is weak.

"Compassionate mind serves as the cause for emptiness-view" means that one first cultivates compassion, which then gives rise to the wisdom of emptiness, hence it is said that compassionate mind serves as the cause for emptiness-view. It is also like the original portion serving as the cause for jealousy, malice, and violence: the original portion is the general delusion, the cause of all delusions, while jealousy and the like are specific delusions, all arising from the original portion. This elucidates that compassion serves as the cause for emptiness-view, just as the original portion serves as the cause for jealousy and the like. However, in terms of understanding, the specific gives rise to the general, hence the specific understanding of compassion gives rise to the general understanding. In terms of delusion, the general gives rise to the specific, hence the general delusion of the original portion gives rise to the specific delusions of violence and the like.

"Because the cause is present" means that since the cause of the original portion’s delusion is present, its delusive fruition arises, hence the function of the compassionate mind cannot endure. "The seventh dual contemplations are likewise" refers to the seventh as the contemplation of old age, and the dual contemplations as those of the middle and small vehicles. It elucidates that within the contemplation of old age, there are those of the middle and small vehicles whose compassionate minds are weak, and whose subduing of delusions is also inconsistent. Another interpretation: the seventh, counting downward from the contemplation of old age, is the arising of insight. It elucidates that the arising of insight marks the beginning of entering the immortal stream, where compassion has not yet subdued delusions, hence the compassion of the two vehicles is inconsistent.

In the eighth vehicle of diligence, one fully possesses emptiness-view. The eighth vehicle of diligence, when spoken of in an elevated manner, does not yet fully possess compassion and sympathetic joy; when spoken of in a modest manner, it is said to possess them. Relying on the previous seven immortals, where compassion has understanding, it aids the arising of the Great One, and the wisdom of emptiness is able to arise, cutting off the conditions of delusive thoughts from the original portion, attaining the principle of indeterminate emptiness. Thus, it is said to fully possess emptiness-view.

Why is this so? When one reaches the stage of the eighth vehicle, one realizes the perception beyond nothingness. "Wisdom-life purified" means that having cut off the original portion, one ultimately attains emptiness, and the wisdom of forgetting arises. Delusion does not enter the body of wisdom, hence it is said that the wisdom-life is purified. "Beyond the fault of perception" means beyond the fault of evil perceptions. Another interpretation: beyond the fault of inherent perception. Speaking directly of "beyond" is to discuss it in terms of its portion, and is also a modest manner of speaking.

Thus, one is able to destroy the great cause of birth and death and realize the non-retrogressive vehicle. The "great cause of birth and death" refers to the original portion; the four kings of inherent views are also the original portion. It elucidates that since beings departed from emptiness and entered existence, the arising of delusion must first arise from the original portion, binding them to the desire realm as the kings of all delusions, hence they are called the four kings of views. They are also the great cause of entering birth and death, hence they are called the great cause of birth and death. "Arriving at the place of peace" refers to the ten vehicles, collectively called the middle peace. "Non-retrogressive vehicle" means that upon entering the first vehicle, the wisdom of the Great One arises, and one no longer retrogresses into a bound ordinary being, hence it is said to realize the non-retrogressive vehicle.

When one realizes this vehicle, even heavenly demons and heterodox paths cannot obstruct or destroy it. "Supreme Dao King" refers to the great fruition of the Heavenly Worthy. Having entered the ten vehicles, one is able to cut off and extinguish all delusions, and the function of compassion endures. Thus, one often engages in the practices of wisdom, and with every thought, one vows to decisively attain the supreme Dao King, not to be terrified, obstructed, or destroyed by heavenly demons or heterodox paths.

One is further able to sever the root of impermanence and not lose the Dao-mind. The "root of impermanence" is also the delusion of the original portion. "Dao-mind" refers to the mind that diligently and deeply seeks the Dao. Having entered the vehicle of diligence, one no longer slackens, loses mindfulness, or gives rise to evil delusions, hence it is said that one does not lose the Dao-mind.

One decisively does not engage in the Two Vehicles or the Seven Observations—hence it is called the Secure and Tranquil Vehicle. The "Two Vehicles" refer to the medium and lesser vehicles of practitioners. The "Seven Observations" are the observations of the seven immortals. Having realized the Ten Transformations, one does not regress into the medium or lesser vehicles or the observations of the seven immortals, nor does one become a being among the nine destinies. One thus departs from the realm of fear and dread within the Three Realms, hence it is named the Secure and Tranquil Vehicle.

A "vehicle" is of one kind—why then is it also said to depart from the supreme Dao-mind? It is clarified that there are two types of vehicles: those of departure and non-departure. "Departure" entails cultivating compassion and practicing various forms of wisdom, thereby attaining the supreme fruition of the Dao King and departing from the Three Realms and the Five Paths. "Non-departure" involves harboring the Four Views, failing to uphold precepts and conduct, and thus not departing from the retributions of the Three Wretched Paths and the Five Sufferings. Yet within non-departure, there is also a form of departure, and within departure, there is also non-departure—all of which may be understood accordingly.

Furthermore, the term "vehicle" encompasses many meanings, including extraction, movement, passage, motion, and progression by inches. "Extraction" means lifting from above to below; "emergence" pertains to the fruition; while "movement," "passage," and "motion" pertain to the cause. "I possess a vehicle"—this refers to the vehicle of departure. It carries and transports beings, departing to unite in virtue with the Four Emptinesses, arriving at the realm of non-death. This vehicle is named "wisdom by inches," hence it unites with the Four Emptinesses.

The vehicles of heterodox paths and miscellaneous immortals—since they lack wisdom, commit the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes, and fail to cultivate the Ten Precepts or the Four Immeasurables—fall into the Three Wretched Paths and cycle through the Five Destinies. Thus, they are not my vehicle.

My vehicle can perceive the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds. Using the Ganges’ sands as a metaphor: if one grain of sand measures forty *li* in length and breadth, and each grain of sand within this forty-*li* expanse represents one world—one world being illuminated by a single sun and moon—then one Ganges’ sand equates to one thousand worlds, and three Ganges’ sands equate to three thousand worlds. These three thousand worlds together form one Great Thousand World. My vehicle can illuminate and perceive the lands of brightness and darkness within these Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds, as well as the forms and minds of all beings and creatures, leaving nothing unseen.

If there are beings who encounter this scripture and cultivate accordingly, they shall attain such blessings. They will not fall into the Three Wretched Paths or the Nine Dark Realms.

*Dongxuan Lingbao Zuoxuan Lun*, Scroll Two, concludes.
*Dongxuan Lingbao Zuoxuan Lun*, Scroll Three begins.
**Chapter Five: The King of the Thirty-Six Supreme Scriptures**

The scriptures comprise Three Caverns, revealed in three distinct eras. The *Dongzhen* was expounded by the Heavenly Treasure Lord in the first year of the Dragon Han era, governing enlightenment. The *Dongxuan* was expounded by the Numinous Treasure Lord in the first year of the Red Brightness era, governing repentance for scholars. The *Dongshen* was expounded by the Divine Treasure Lord in the first year of the Kaihuang era, governing the summoning and recording of the hundred spirits. Each of the Three Caverns contains twelve divisions, and together they form the Thirty-Six Divisions, which serve as the kings of all scriptures. The twelve divisions are counted by scrolls, while the thirty-six divisions are distinguished by their meanings.

**The Master’s Esoteric Matters**

I, the author of this treatise, have always followed my teacher to receive what is called the esoteric matters. *Always* means *constantly*; one version writes it as *曾* (*once*). It states that I have constantly studied under my teacher, who instructed me in the methods of learning, enabling me to cultivate the Twelve Divisions of Scriptures. By practicing the Seventeen Vehicles of the Sages as the gateway of causes and employing the Thirty-Six Divisions of Scriptures as the vessel, one may cross the sea of suffering. *Esoteric matters* refers to profound and hidden truths. What is discussed here concerns the great fruit of the Heavenly Worthy, a fruit that harbors wisdom—hence it is called the esoteric matters.

**The Seventeen Vehicles of the Sages as the Nurturing Vessel of Father and Mother’s Milk**

This explains that those who uphold these scriptures serve as the nurturing vessel of the Seventeen Vehicles of the Sages, the father and mother’s milk, providing care, protection, and conveyance. The *father* is likened to the Dao: externally, the father is the head of the household; internally, the Dao is the supreme among all ways. The *mother* is likened to the teacher: externally, the mother raises her children, following only the father’s teachings; internally, the teacher instructs disciples, adhering solely to the scriptures and methods of the Dao. The *milk* is likened to the scriptures: externally, the mother nurtures her child with no other means than milk; internally, the teacher instructs disciples with no other method than the scriptures. Another interpretation takes the *milk* as a general metaphor for the scriptures, signifying that these scriptures serve the Seventeen Vehicles of the Sages as the nurturing vessel of father and mother’s milk.

**Generating Growth and Eradicating Heterodox Ways and Miscellaneous Immortals**

This explains that these scriptures can teach people to practice, and through practice, attain the supreme kingship of the Dao. *Eradicating heterodox ways and miscellaneous immortals* refers to those who cultivate yin-yang, astrology, calendrical arts, and other deviant or miscellaneous techniques. When one practices the great teachings of the Three Caverns, even a single act of cultivation strips these heterodox teachings of their efficacy, rendering them useless. Another interpretation holds that the emergence of these scriptures immediately eradicates heterodox teachings, as the scriptures state: *"Execute the false seats"*—this is the meaning.

**The Essential and Wondrous Nature of the Dharma, Hence Called Scriptures**

*This Dharma* refers to the Dharma of the Thirty-Six Divisions of Scriptures. *Essential* means that its words are concise yet profound, its principles deep and wondrous. *True* means not false, also indicating purity—free from the words and phrases of heterodox ways, miscellaneous immortals, or worldly speech interspersed within. It is also not subject to destruction or alteration by the great demons of the Three Realms or the beings of the Nine Paths. *Constant* means the constant teachings of the scriptures, the path to attaining the Dao, the common thoroughfare of the worthy and the sages—hence it is called *scriptures*.

**The Names of the Twelve Divisions of Scriptures and Their Explanations**

Here, the names of the Twelve Divisions of Scriptures are listed in order and explained, as detailed in the subsequent text.

**Question: What Are the Chapter Markers?**

This is a self-posed question to enlighten the reader.

**Answer: Such as the Dao’s Practices Being Called Wisdom Practices**

*Such as the practices of the supreme Dao being called wisdom practices* clarifies that to seek the practices of the supreme Dao, one must cultivate the wisdom practices of the Seventeen Vehicles of the Sages to sever, subdue, and eradicate delusions. *Walking the upright path of the Dao* means that if one practices these wisdom practices, one will embody boundless compassion, refrain from heterodox teachings, miscellaneous paths, or the arts of deviant masters—hence it is called *walking the upright path of the Dao*. Moreover, it can guide and support the Seventeen Vehicles of the Sages to the place of the adamantine fruit of wisdom—hence it is called *the root of wisdom*. Thus, the *Weft of the Treatise* states: *"Not the root of folly but the root of the foolish."* *Not the root of folly* refers to the root of wisdom; *but the root of the foolish* means it serves as the foundation for teaching the foolish.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arises the Jade Characters, Comprising Four Meanings**

Since the root of wisdom is the foundation of the Twelve Divisions, the jade characters arise from it. *Jade characters* are so named because they encompass four meanings: first, jade possesses moisture; second, jade is free from flaws; third, jade produces sound; and fourth, jade possesses virtue. These scriptures are likened to jade, embodying these four meanings—hence they are called *jade characters*.

**The Four Meanings Leading to the Supreme Fruit**

The first meaning is that jade possesses moisture. Externally, where mountains bear jade, the forests and trees do not wither. Internally, these scriptures can nourish the roots of good wisdom, enabling the attainment of the supreme great Dao—hence they are likened to jade.

The second meaning is purity, leading to the supreme and most exalted place. This refers to jade being free from flaws. Externally, if jade has flaws, they appear on its surface. Internally, these scriptures are pure and luminous, free from the words, phrases, or orations of heterodox ways, miscellaneous immortals, or worldly people. If such impurities existed, they would be evident. The *supreme and most exalted place* refers to the great fruit of the Heavenly Worthy, which can also convey beings to the place of the supreme and most exalted immortals, the adamantine great fruit.

The third meaning is the subtle and wondrous sound of the master. This refers to jade producing sound. Externally, jade emits a resonant chime. Internally, the essence of these scriptures possesses a pure, subtle, and wondrous sound. If beings with virtuous inclinations listen to and practice this sound, they will, upon hearing it, generate love and joy for the sound of the supreme Dharma due to their virtuous cultivation. Because they love the sound of the supreme Dharma, they can refine and discern all sounds, ultimately attaining the state of the master of subtle and wondrous sound. The *master of subtle and wondrous sound* is the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

The fourth meaning is that among all things, jade is esteemed. This refers to jade possessing virtue. Externally, among all stones, jade is the most precious, as Laozi said: *"Beautiful jade lies among stones."* Internally, among all scriptures of the Dao, these scriptures are the most esteemed—hence they are likened to jade.

*My teacher* is the Heavenly Worthy. *And my disciples* refers to the disciples of the author of this treatise, including Fang.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Spirit Talismans, Hence Called Spirit Talismans**

*Talisman* means *accord*, signifying that these scriptures are the ultimate refuge for all spirits and sages. They are profound and serene, boundless and without limit, the foremost of all.

Since they serve as the ultimate refuge for all spirits and numinous beings, with no discord or divergence, they are called *Spirit Talismans*.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Wondrous Formulas, Hence Called Wondrous Formulas**

*Formula* pertains to wondrous matters. Thus, the *Weft of Treatises* states: *"Not coarse formulas for coarse matters, but wondrous formulas for wondrous matters."* They excel in discerning fortune from misfortune, good from evil, and are most fitting and unparalleled in principle. Another interpretation: *fitting* means *central*—they discern fortune and misfortune so perfectly that none among the sagely ranks can rival them. *Formula* signifies that the principles expounded are without error.

Thus, within these scriptures, formulas do not speak of the sins of the five rebellions as mere mental fabrications, but as fully realized through body and speech, yet they enable one to attain joy in body and mind, free from affliction. Nor do they speak of taking refuge in minor immortals or heterodox paths, for they can shatter the great causes of birth and death, sever the delusions of the four views, and ascend to the adamantine fruit. They further distinguish and expound all gates of Daoist cultivation, guiding practice to transcend the nine demonic realms.

When disciples posed questions about miscellaneous immortals, these formulas resolved them with perfect clarity, leaving no room for error—hence they are called *wondrous formulas*.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Precepts and Regulations, Hence Called Precepts and Regulations**

*Precepts* mean *to cease* and also *goodness*. *Regulations* mean *law*. Ordinary people, bound by the four views, have not entered the ranks of immortals and cannot sever or subdue them. Those free of such bonds have entered the ten vehicles and can cut through delusion—this is what it means to be *free of them*. It is also said that the seven immortals can subdue their allotted portion but have not yet attained fruition, which likewise means they are *not free of them*. All below the ten vehicles remain in the realm of ordinary beings, hence it is said that ordinary people *possess* or *do not possess* the four views.

The *six applications of the mind* refer to the six forms of wisdom that illuminate form. *And the four modes of grasping* refer to the four minds. The minds and wisdom of ordinary beings are weak and cannot engage all objects at once; they discern realms through these four minds. It is by virtue of these six applications of the mind and four modes of grasping that ordinary beings harbor the delusions of the four views, leading them to confusion, inversion, and reckless indulgence, thereby falling into the three evil destinies and five sufferings. *Unable to attain* means they cannot swiftly achieve the supreme Dao—or, in another sense, that they cannot swiftly arouse the mind for the supreme Dao.

*Vigilance* means to guard against and awaken to external realms. The *Dao of Heaven* is the great Dao. The Dao of Heaven possesses a fundamental vow, and thus expounds scriptures and precepts to rectify conduct, urging vigilance against evil views.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Numinous Charts, Hence Called Numinous Charts**

*Unmanifest* refers to the future. The *Great Master of the Five Paths* is the Heavenly Worthy. *Disciples* are the disciples of the Heavenly Worthy. The old interpretation holds that *numinous* refers to painted images. This is not so. It clarifies that in the future kalpa, sentient beings will be unable to encounter the Great Master of the Five Paths manifesting in person to expound the Dao. The disciples of the Heavenly Worthy compile the deeds spoken by the Heavenly Worthy—whether describing his eighteen-foot golden body, his thousand-fathom jade countenance, appearing upon the Weak Waters, leaving traces at Chang Sang, revealing his form in fire, or concealing his shape within a pearl—arranging proofs to manifest the eyes and brows of sagely affairs. Hence they are called *numinous charts*.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Genealogical Records, Hence Called Genealogical Records**

*Genealogical records* refer to ancestral records and documented accounts. They trace and document the origins of ancestors, such as the events of the Dragon Han and Red Clarity kalpas, or the beginnings of past eons. Hence they are called *genealogical records*.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Methods and Practices, Hence Attaining the Myriad Gates of Contemplation**

*Methods and practices* refer to such teachings as the Three Refuges, the Ten Precepts, and the Seventeen Sagely Vehicles, which contemplate the four directions as gateways to entering the great Dao, each with its proper sequence. *Taking refuge in the body* means dedicating this seven-foot form to the great Dao. *Taking refuge in the spirit* means that the spirit—here referring to the mind-spirit—is dedicated to the Dao. The body is coarse and easily employed, hence refuge in the spirit is mentioned first, for the subtle is difficult to direct. *Taking refuge in life* follows, for *life* refers to form as the continuous support that does not break. This continuous life is dedicated to the great Dao. Since form and mind are interconnected, they are slightly harder to direct, hence this is explained afterward. Once these three kinds of wisdom are perfected, they generate supreme faith, enabling entry into the twenty-four contemplations and the myriad gates of contemplation.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Praises and Recitations, Hence Called Recitations and Explications**

The old interpretation holds that *praise* means admiration, while *recitation* arises from extended passages, hence it is called *recitation*. This is not necessarily so—both are terms of praise. Such teachings are truly wondrous, and expressions like *without pause* are all forms of praise and recitation. It clarifies that the sagely hosts of the ten directions, filled with joy and longing for the Heavenly Worthy’s Dharma, cannot restrain their exultation, and thus praise, recite, and explicate it. Hence they are called *recitations and explications*.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Mantras and Arts, Hence Subduing the Myriad Demons**

The old interpretation holds that *mantra* means *incantation*, and *art* means *deception*—cunning methods to accomplish tasks, such as carving skin to simulate a crawling snake or tying a kerchief to mimic a running rabbit, all of which are deceptive arts. This is not so. They refer to various methods of incantation and arts, such as the *Fengdu Protective Spirit Mantra*, all of which are *mantras and arts*. *Dignified conduct and proper practice* mean that if one’s dignified conduct and proper practice are well-ordered, they can summon and command the true immortals and Dharma hosts of the ten directions, and also subdue all demonic spirits and spectral beings.

**From the Root of Wisdom Arise the Records and Transmissions, Hence the Twelve Divisions of Scriptures Are Circulated**

*Transmission* means to transmit. When the disciples of the Heavenly Worthy and the sagely hosts of the ten directions transcribe these twelve divisions of scriptures and propagate them for posterity, they are called *records and transmissions*.

From the Root of Wisdom Arise the *Manifestos and Declarations*, Hence the Most Wondrous and Supreme Scriptures

The old interpretation holds that *manifestos and declarations* refer to memorials, petitions, and the like, collectively called *manifestos and declarations*. This is not so. *Manifest* means to clarify; *declare* means to reveal. These scriptures clarify and reveal the sagely principles, hence they are called *manifestos and declarations*.

The *Dongxuan Lingbao Zuoxuan Lun*, Scroll Three, concludes here.
The *Dongxuan Lingbao Zuoxuan Lun*, Scroll Four

The *Supreme and Essential Daoist Arts* refer to the Three Caverns’ scriptures. These scriptures expound the great compassion and impartiality of the Dao, broadly delivering the beings of the Three Realms and the Five Existences, embodying the meaning of relinquishment and abandonment. Since they clarify and reveal, they are not concealed. *Supreme among the supreme* refers to the thirty-six divisions of scriptures, which are the highest of the high. By virtue of these meanings, the twelve divisions are thus called the *Wuji Zhizhen Zhimiao Zuishang Shangjing* (The Most Wondrous and Supreme Scriptures of the Utmost Truth without Limit).

**Question:** Are they the same or different?
**Answer:** The *Dingding Chenglin* (The Forest of Supreme Wisdom) refers to the forest of supreme wisdom. The Root of Wisdom is the root, while the eleven divisions are the branches, stems, flowers, and leaves, together forming the forest of supreme wisdom.

**Question:** Why does the Root of Wisdom only give rise to eleven divisions and not one, two, or countless divisions?
**Answer:** If this were so, the virtues of the supreme great fruit should not be limitless but should be confined to twelve virtues.

**Answer:** The *distinct* refers to the twelve divisions of scriptures. The *indistinct* refers to the myriad virtues. The *worldly* refers to the twelve divisions of scriptures circulating in the world. The *unworldly* refers to the myriad virtues not circulating in the world.

**Question:** If the wondrous formulas do not arise from the Jade Characters, but only from the Root of Wisdom, then should acts of reverence and merit-making also arise solely from the Root of Wisdom and not from the wondrous formulas?
**Answer:** The eleven divisions, together with the Root of Wisdom, are collectively called the Root of Wisdom and can all generate merit. If any being takes refuge in and believes in these scriptures, one does not say that only the Root of Wisdom generates merit while the Jade Characters do not. Thus, the Three Caverns’ twelve divisions of scriptures are called the King of Merit.

**The Fourfold Peace and Impartial Wisdom**
The *Fourfold Peace* refers to the practice of the four equalities of compassion. These four equalities, applied to both enemies and loved ones without partiality, are called the four equalities. Each of the four equalities has nine grades; one must grasp the final, ninth grade to perfect the practice of the four equalities. For beginners, loved ones are preferred over enemies; for the accomplished, enemies are treated as loved ones. As the text states: "Those who cultivate the four equalities always dwell in peace."

As the scriptures say: *Teaching is compassion; jealousy is hatred.* To resent others’ possessions and be angered by one’s own lack is called *jealousy*. Jealousy is a specific delusion, while compassion is a specific liberation; the liberation of compassion directly counteracts the delusion of jealousy. Compassion is called *universal pity* or *understanding mercy*; with a compassionate heart, jealousy does not arise.

Those who are violent and cruel should now cultivate *sadness*. Violence and cruelty refer to hearts filled with rage, killing fathers, harming rulers, and beating living beings. Violence and cruelty are specific delusions, while sadness is a specific liberation; the liberation of sadness directly counteracts the delusion of violence. Sadness is called *pity* or *grief*; with a sad heart, violence does not arise.

**The Two Wisdoms Do Not Abide, Adorning Compassion and Sadness**
The *Two Wisdoms* refer to the wisdoms of compassion and sadness. Since compassion and sadness are forms of liberation that do not cut off delusion but only suppress it, they cannot be constantly restrained and may sometimes arise unintentionally, hence they are said to *not abide*. Since they do not abide, they rely on the undetermined emptiness of the Great One to nurture the wisdom of forbearance. Once the wisdom of forbearance arises, it eliminates specific delusions such as jealousy, hatred, violence, and cruelty. Only when the essence of compassion and sadness is illuminated can they truly abide.

**Eradicating the Karmic Retributions of the Three Realms and Nine Paths**
The beings of the Three Realms and Nine Paths are bound by the four views and delusions, giving rise to the Nine Paths. Now, by cultivating the four equalities and the wisdom of emptiness, establishing rules and standards, one can eradicate the karmic retributions of the four views and actions of the beings in the Nine Paths.

**Why Does the Wisdom of Forbearance in the Gate of Emptiness Sometimes Fail to Sustain Compassion?**
When abiding in the seven sagely observations, one is still a common being. At that time, the wisdom of emptiness is not established, the root of delusion is not seen, and the four views cannot be eradicated. Compassion and sadness are weak, only able to suppress delusions, not constant, and sometimes forgotten, hence called *unsteady in heart*. Sometimes there is compassion, sometimes there is none.

**When Obstructed by Sadness, Compassion and Sadness Cannot Be Applied to Others**
The obstruction of sadness refers to jealousy, hatred, violence, and cruelty. When these obstructions appear, compassion and sadness cannot be applied, hence they are said to *not be applied to others*.

**All Other Wisdom Practices Are Likewise**
This clarifies that all wisdoms are like compassion and sadness.

When diligence and indolence oppose each other, if indolence arises, diligence is suppressed and concealed. All other wisdoms are likewise.

What is called "emptiness" is not the endurance of non-emptiness. "Non-emptiness" clarifies that compassion and sadness are existent, and wisdom is not the wisdom of emptiness. Only when wisdom endures is it called the wisdom of emptiness.

What is named "able to sever and extinguish within the realm of wisdom"? "Able to sever and extinguish" refers to the arising of the initial vehicle’s wisdom of emptiness, which severs and removes the root of fundamental delusion, preventing it from entering the essence of wisdom.

Thus, the ten thousand wisdoms abide, named the *Must-Must Vehicle*. Since delusion does not enter the essence of wisdom, the ten thousand wisdoms abide, hence the name *Must-Must Vehicle*. The *Must-Must Vehicle* is the vehicle of diligence; as the Ten Vehicles can draw forth the fruit of *Must-Must*, it is called the *Must-Must Vehicle*.

"At the time before entering abiding" refers to passing through countless realms. "Not yet entering abiding" means not yet entering the Ten Turning Vehicles. "Abiding in non-abiding" means being outside the Ten Turnings. Since one has not entered the Turnings, one experiences rebirth in the Nine Paths, passing through countless realms.

"If reborn in the heavens up to the *Must-Must Vehicle*": Though one receives rebirth in the Nine Paths, if one can cultivate without weariness among the heavens or humans, one may attain the secure abode of the Ten Vehicles.

"The preceding two wisdoms’ inferior merits and the non-concealment of supreme wisdom": The "preceding two" are compassion and sadness. "Inferior" refers to being bound by inferior states. "Supreme wisdom" is the wisdom of the Great One. If one broadly cultivates compassion and sadness, one nurtures the non-concealment of the Great One’s wisdom of emptiness.

"If among the Nine Paths’ multitudes...": If among the Nine Paths’ multitudes there is one who cultivates the Four Equalities for one or two moments, all Heavenly Worthies and countless great immortals will reverently honor this person. Why? Because they cultivate the Four Equalities. The Four Equalities are the great field of blessings by which all Heavenly Worthies and great sages attain the Dao. "One moment, two moments" refer to the first and second grades, also called the first and second ranks.

"If every single being...": "Shaking" means startling and destroying. "The shoots and roots of ascetic practice" are the roots, trunks, branches, and leaves of all delusions and evils. Hearing of one who practices the Four Equalities, all are scorched and withered, broken and unable to grow.

"From the Six Heavens of the Three Realms...": The demon kings of the Six Heavens of the Three Realms all weep. There are three reasons: first, if people cultivate goodness, they transcend the demon realm, and demons fear losing their subjects; second, they must show reverence; third, they must escort them. As demons do not wish for people to attain the Dao, seeing one who cultivates the Four Equalities, all weep, and their demonic armies’ armor and weapons are likewise shattered.

"Why? All good...": Compassion and sadness are distinct realizations; jealousy and cruelty are distinct delusions. If compassion and sadness do not arise, it is as if they never existed; if they arise, they must bring goodness to benefit others, hence "all good gathers through compassion and sadness." If jealousy and cruelty do not arise, it is as if they never existed; if they arise, they must bring evil to harm others, hence "all evil gathers through jealousy and cruelty."

"This Fourfold Equality sees no light or heavy...": "Sees no light or heavy" means not seeing the noble as heavy and the base as light, nor seeing one’s kin as heavy and enemies as light, but always maintaining equality and always attaining security. "Gate" refers to the gate of the Four Equalities; only by practicing thus is it called the *Gate of the Wisdom of the Four Equalities*.

"All supreme Heavenly Worthies...": "Without equal" clarifies that the fruits attained by heterodox and miscellaneous immortals cannot equal the fruit of the Heavenly Worthy, hence "without equal." "Supreme great fruit" is the great fruit of the Heavenly Worthy. "From this gate they come" means that the sagely beings of the Heavenly Worthy’s great fruit all come from the gate of the Four Equalities.

"With immeasurable great power...": "Disciples" are the disciples of the Heavenly Worthy. This clarifies that the Four Equalities possess immeasurable and vast power, so that if every single being cultivates them, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions and all the sagely multitudes of the ten directions will all rejoice and protect this person.

"If every single being...": "First rank, second rank" refer to the first and second grades, also called the first and second ranks of the Four Equalities, each having nine grades. "Ruler" is a virtuous ruler. "Auspicious grain" refers to wheat with double ears and rice with twin stalks. This means that if there is one being in a place who practices the wisdom of the Four Equalities to the first or second rank, in that land locust plagues will not arise, wind and rain will come in due season, the ruler will be gentle, the earth will be abundant with auspicious grain, and pestilence will not spread.

"If there are two beings...": Previously, it was explained that if one person practices equality, their power is still weak, only able to prevent calamitous stars and ensure wind and rain come in due season. Now, if two beings cultivate the Four Equalities, their wisdom and power are great, able to attain the luminous *qi* of heaven and dispel all demonic clouds.

"Thunder and lightning do not rage...": When thunder and lightning rage, it is due to no one practicing the Four Equalities, so that *yin* and *yang* are obstructed and knotted, and thunder and lightning roar with rage. Now, since there are those who practice the Fourfold Equality, thunder and lightning do not rage, and the sun and moon are constantly adorned with pure, radiant, and luminous light, their brilliance encircling the sun and moon.

If three beings fulfill this practice to reach the supreme great realm: Should three beings cultivate these Four Equalities, their merit and virtue will pervade heaven and earth, beyond all words and analogies. They can serve as the bridge and vessel for the nine paths of the three realms, guiding and conveying the great multitude of the nine paths to the supreme Vajra Great Fruit.

Thus, my Master and my disciples always practice this. My Master is the Heavenly Worthy. My disciples are the disciples of the Dharma Master. This practice of the Four Equalities is what my Master and my disciples constantly and reverently uphold and cultivate. Even at my Master’s realm, this practice is still observed. My Master’s realm is the realm of the Heavenly Worthy’s Great Fruit. "Always practicing this" refers to the continuous cultivation of the Four Equalities.

That this is spoken of as "always practicing" even in the realm of fruition has two meanings: first, to encourage later learners, hence it is said that even in my Master’s realm this practice is observed; second, to show that the sage has the original vow of the mind, thus constantly practicing the Four Equalities to deliver sentient beings.

Therefore, they come to all places within the three realms to urge and drive away the followers of the four views. "All places" refers to all realms within the three worlds. "Original vow practice" refers to the vow made in the causal ground. "Original vow" is similar to the original vow, meaning this vow has always existed. "Practice-vow" means the vow to practice, the vow to deliver all sentient beings. "Mutual support" means that sentient beings have the condition of karmic response, and I have the mind of the original vow to support them. Thus, I constantly come to the three realms to practice the Four Equalities, drawing in and urging on the followers of the four views. "Drawing in" means lifting from below, "urging on" means driving from above.

Among them was a miscellaneous immortal who said his mind was unsettled: At that time, among the assembly was a miscellaneous immortal named Solitary Practitioner, who posed a question: "I have studied my Master’s scriptures for thirty-two years, thoroughly understanding all *yin-yang* astrology, human relations, and their applications. Yet I have never heard such strange teachings from the Dharma Master as today, and my mind is unsettled."

"My Master and I... do not let them be suppressed": Solitary Practitioner said, "My Master told me that in heaven and on earth, there is no one who surpasses me. If there is anyone whose learning differs from mine, I will break my pillow to make them submit. Now I wish to thoroughly refute this teaching, and I demand a clear explanation so that no doubt remains."

Then the Supreme Highest Great Dharma Master said, "I will answer you": The Supreme Great Dharma Master is the Dharma Master himself. The Supreme Wisdom Master refers to the Heavenly Worthy. The Dharma Master said, "I have learned this supreme wisdom from the Supreme Wisdom Master. Now that you have asked, I shall explain it to you."

Then Solitary Practitioner asked: Is this not what is meant by the four virtues of the King? This is Solitary Practitioner summarizing the Dharma Master’s previous teachings to raise his question. "Otherwise" means "I think it is not so." If there are only words without principle, then it is the meaning of the four defeats, not the four virtues like those of the King.

Though the Dharma Master had not yet spoken of the four defeats, he had always spoken of them. Since Solitary Practitioner had been present in the assembly when the four defeats were discussed, he now claims that the Dharma Master’s teachings lack principle and thus embody the four defeats, not the four virtues like those of the King.

"Why is this? If the sun and moon... is not due to the power of the Four Equalities": I say that the sun and moon are bright when there are no clouds and dark when there are clouds; spring is bright due to *yang*, and autumn is dark due to *yin*. This alternation of brightness and darkness in spring and autumn is not related to the practice of the Four Equalities. When dragons rise, clouds form; when tigers roar, wind arises; when *yang* shakes, thunder and lightning surge; when *yin* is still, thunder and lightning subside—none of this is due to the practice of the Four Equalities.

"Different from my Master... is not due to the power of the Four Equalities": Now hearing this teaching, it differs from my Master’s. According to my Master’s calculations and my scriptures, when the Son of Heaven governs in accordance with heaven, grains and crops flourish, and the earth produces auspicious plants—this is also not due to the power of the Four Equalities.

"Therefore, I come... why do you speak so many defeated meanings?": Furthermore, you say you always practice this. Why, then, did you not come before arriving, and why do you leave after coming? Since there is coming and going, how can it be called "always practicing"? With such teachings, the immortal master does not embody the four virtues of the King but rather the four defeats. Why do you speak so many defeated meanings?

Then the Highest Dharma Master smiled and answered: The Highest Great Compassion, pitying his lack of understanding, smiled and replied. "Excessive words" refers to words of fault. "Spring and summer reversed" means, for example, enacting winter ordinances in spring or spring ordinances in winter. "Eclipses of the sun and moon" refers to obscurations. "Dull darkness" means deep darkness. "Barren and salty earth" refers to land producing salt and thorns. All these occur because no one practices the wisdom of the Four Equalities, and thus one cannot correspond to the Son of Heaven.

The wisdom of the Four Equalities harmonizes *yin* and *yang*... all actions are good: This wisdom of the Four Equalities skillfully harmonizes *yin* and *yang*, eliminates disasters and evils, subdues fierce enemies, and prevents neighboring states from raising arms. Wherever this practice is cultivated, all is good.

"I come for two causes and leave for three causes": The two causes are: first, the karmic response of sentient beings; second, my original vow. The three causes are: first, the Dharma teaching is complete; second, the karmic conditions of sentient beings have ceased; third, to reside longer elsewhere.

Fearing that sentient beings might grow weary and afflicted, I must therefore depart.

"Externally relying on conditions to mutually support coming and going": Externally relying on conditions refers to the karmic response of sentient beings. Internally, I am constant—my original vow is ever to deliver sentient beings. "Mutually supporting coming and going" means that karmic conditions and the original vow together provide mutual reliance.

"The so-called two causes... returning to the place of no-abode": "Admonishing me" means to warn and protect, teaching precepts to sentient beings as a cautionary vigilance. "Not my former abode" refers to this place of karmic response, which is not where I formerly resided. For these three causes fully present, I must therefore return to the place of no-abode.

At that time, the Solitary Practitioner again spoke: "...how can one wish to return to that place?" This is the dialogue between the Miscellaneous Immortals and the Master of Discourse, questioning the coming and going to the place of no-abode.

The Exalted One again spoke: "...therefore it is called *ziran* (natural/spontaneous)." The two *ziran*: within the Three Realms is one *ziran*, beyond the Three Realms is another *ziran*—hence the two *ziran*. The five *ziran* are the five voids. "Distinct from the void of place": this *ziran* differs from the five voids and the Five Paths. "Not following bonds and fetters": not bound by the four views or the delusions of attachment—thus it is called *ziran*.

"Perfect in *ziran*... thus the abode is without location": "Perfect in *ziran*" is the great fruit, the great place of peace of the Heavenly Worthy. "Without high or low": within this fruit, there is no high or low, no music, no Six Jia or Eight Trigrams, no Five Phases or dwellings. The Six Jia and Five Phases are all impermanent functions—thus they are absent in this fruit. The Four Non-Actions are the Four Unobstructed Voids, which unite in virtue with this natural void to jointly perfect the square mandate—hence the abode is without location.

Yet this abode is not of wood or stone... thus it is said to be the place of no-abode: This natural place is not within the five elements, the wood-and-stone numerology, the various heavens of the Three Realms, or the realm of Miscellaneous Immortals—thus it is called the place of no-abode.

At that time, the Solitary Practitioner... entreating to receive and study the supreme true words: "Worldly teacher" refers to the teacher of the mundane world. "Perfect in delusion and arrogance": lacking the wisdom to sever and subdue both the emptiness and existence views, as well as the delusions of the common and distinct paths—thus it is called perfect in delusion and arrogance. "Bestow the power of compassion": since the Master of Discourse practices compassion, he entreats for the power of compassion, not to be met with anger or aversion, and wishes to be accepted as a disciple to receive and study the supreme true words.

The Exalted One then imparted the Five Precepts... the Seven Sagely Vehicles: The Seven Sagely Vehicles are the Seven Immortal Vehicles. Those who seek to receive and study are thus first given the Five Precepts, enabling them to cultivate the practices of the Seven Sagely Immortal Vehicles.
