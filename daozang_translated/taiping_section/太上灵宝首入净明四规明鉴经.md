**Author:** Unknown

**Chapter One: The Fundamental Chapter**

The Dao is inherent in one’s nature; it is not something externally imposed. Filial piety and fraternal duty are the roots of the Dao, not something forcibly enacted. From filial piety and fraternal duty, one extends to loyalty; thus, these accumulate to form conduct. When conduct is complete, the Dao daily flourishes. Therefore, the noble scholar who studies the Dao establishes loyalty and filial piety as the foundation. With the foundation set, the Dao grows day by day.

The Dao merges indistinguishably; it is the same for the foolish and the wise. Foolishness and wisdom do not divide the Dao. The foolish are benighted, the wise are cunning; benightedness obscures clarity, cunning undermines authenticity. Lacking clarity and authenticity, one drifts ever farther from the Dao. To know the Dao is to dispel foolishness, to cast off cleverness, and to achieve true clarity. Being true, one aligns with the Dao, and the Dao then becomes yours.

To study the Dao is to attain immortality; immortality is not difficult—loyalty and filial piety come first. Without loyalty and filial piety, to seek the Dao and hope for immortality is something that has never been. Bi Gan sacrificed his life to fulfill loyalty; life is what people cherish most, yet Bi Gan did not cling to his life but relinquished it to seek the Dao. He trusted in the Dao’s completeness, knowing it would not fail him, and thus became an immortal. Great Shun devoted his life to fulfill filial piety; toil is what people most dread, yet Shun did not shrink from labor but endured it to seek the Dao. He trusted in the Dao’s completeness, knowing it would not fail him, and thus became truly steadfast.

The Dao of loyalty and filial piety does not necessarily grant longevity, yet the nature of longevity persists beyond death without fading. Those ranked among the immortals are called "long-lived." Some speak of cultivating qi to extend years, but those who live long without merit grasp only a fraction of the truth. The noble one’s attainment of the Dao lies in the perfection of the eight eights.

Thus, Shan Juan sacrificed himself to perfect integrity; Nan Rong repeated the jade tablet’s lesson to perfect prudence; Rong Qi endured poverty to perfect magnanimity; Yan Hui found abundance in a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle. Such people all stand foremost among the immortal ministers—how could they be mere emaciated recluses of mountains and marshes?

Later generations, having lost the Dao, are disloyal and unfilial, bringing chaos to their states. When the state collapses, they find no refuge and retreat to the mountains to study the Dao. This is like abandoning a mansion to enter a raging fire.

Have you not seen that when the people are disloyal, Heaven raises ministers of greed and plunder? When children are unfilial, wives bear descendants who ruin the clan. War, drought, and locusts are not the state’s fault. If the ruler is disloyal and unfilial above, and ministers and people are disloyal and unfilial below, qi resonates and gives rise to these calamities. Those who cause chaos accumulate transgressions within themselves; evil intentions fill them, and sins amass until rebellion sprouts in their hearts. Heaven uses this to correct their crimes, employing others’ hands to kill them. To call the people innocent—how can such words be known?

As disciples, we teach that loyalty and filial piety are the foundation. Establishing this foundation to attain immortality, the immortals of the world can be counted in full. Never has there been one who was disloyal and unfilial yet ascended to the celestial court to serve the imperial throne.

**Chapter Two: Cultivating the Self**

Loyalty and filial piety free one from transgressions and distance misfortune. Cultivation dispels falsehood and deception; without falsehood and deception, the body is at peace. Cultivation means using the mind to reach the mind, using nature to reach nature. When mind and nature are thoroughly illuminated, their radiance shines forth.

Return the qi of the cinnabar field to the celestial palace; restore the qi of primordial essence to the great sea. Do not be burdened by external things, so that the physical form cannot constrain you, nor can glory and splendor tempt you. Knowing sufficiency, one is always content, and afflictions fade. Knowing harmony, one harmonizes, and disputes dissolve.

The body does not belong to itself—how then can it possess things? Untainted by external things, how can there be delusion? When mind and nature are true, when essence and spirit are full, by day there is no false awareness, and one’s actions are genuine. By night there are no false dreams, and one’s rest is secure.

Gather the mind back to the body; gather thoughts to attain correctness. One’s qi steams forth, one’s spirit expands, and one’s vision soars. Communing spirit with spirit, the spirit becomes numinous of itself. Seizing qi with qi, qi emerges into the great void. Within the great void, the spirit stands solitary. Solitary and unshaken, the mind and nature remain unshaken. When mind and nature are harmonized, talismans and elixirs become mere tools, to be discarded.

The superior scholar need not retreat to the mountains, sever human affairs, abandon wife and children, withdraw to the wilderness, or forsake glory and splendor to be called one who cultivates. To cultivate mind and nature, to clarify the mind and unblock qi, to never fail in filial piety and fraternal duty—this differs from the emaciated youths of mountains and marshes.

Those who understand my Dao find it not difficult to practice. Use the mind to reach the mind; use nature to transform nature. Let nature rest in oneness; let the mind rest in the spirit. When mind and nature are perfectly fused, one naturally attains longevity. With longevity, one naturally transforms; the supreme Dao is not difficult to know, and the supreme Dao is exceedingly easy.

Petty people abandon the easy to seek the difficult. When first entering the Dao of Pure Brightness, loyalty, and filial piety, one should seek what is easy. Mastering the easy, one need not fear the difficult. This is the clarity and thorough illumination of mind and nature, the inherent truth of humanity, not something feigned.

Attaining the Dao of true constancy, the Dao is thus present.

**Chapter Three: Establishing Merit**

In the world, there is a wondrous Dao from which sagely merit arises and numinous clarity emerges. Numinous clarity means the mind manifests as spirit, and nature manifests as clarity. With merit, one attains the Dao, for the Dao does not obscure our mind and nature. Without merit, one loses the Dao, drifting from the path of mind and nature. The mind is not clear, and nature is not numinous.

The superior scholar who grasps the Dao’s wonder resides in the truth of mind and nature, and delusion is far removed.

To distance oneself from delusion is the way to achieve merit. With a single thought, lead and mercury arise; with a second thought, the yellow sprout flourishes; with a third thought, tiger and dragon unite—the precious cauldron is settled, auspicious clouds emerge, for the clarity and discernment of mind and nature are thus complete.

Herein, one accumulates what is practiced and knows what to esteem. What is esteemed? Esteeming benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and filial piety. When loyalty and filial piety are perfected, the root is established, and merit may be cultivated. The Dao of establishing merit entails no yang blessings squandered, no yin transgressions committed, no burdens from things, no blame from others, no reproach from spirits. Thus, one aligns above with the Three Origins and below with the myriad beings.

Lesser scholars invoke talismanic water and administer medicinal decoctions—merely treating one illness to save one person, yet calling it merit; this is no true merit. Such are the affairs of Daoists, mere expedient dharma gates. Our loyalty, filial piety, purity, and clarity serve as the ministers. Elevating all under heaven to longevity, settling the four seas into Great Peace, the ruler is at ease, the people prosper, and the myriad beings naturally follow. Leading the three armies, one achieves victory without battle, subduing the enemy’s forces. Thus, our troops are ever-victorious. Through our loyalty, the disloyal are transformed into loyalty; through our filial piety, the unfilial are transformed into filial piety—how boundless is such merit!

Why is this so? Where there is delusion and truth, only the utmost truth of the world can subdue the delusions of all people. The loyal, though they sacrifice their lives, do not fear; the filial, though they toil, do not resent—this is the utmost truth of the world. The superior scholar, through truth, obscures delusion, and delusion naturally clears. Then the merit of the world is accomplished—how much more so for people, how much more for spirits and gods?

**Chapter Four: Completing the End**

In learning, what is prized is a beginning, but there must also be an end. Heaven’s affairs begin in spring and culminate in winter, completing the year. Earth’s affairs begin in the east and culminate in the north, achieving the transformation into immortality. Learning begins with filial piety and culminates in the Dao, completing one’s studies.

The superior scholar establishes loyalty and filial piety through refinement; the middling scholar, through resolve; the lesser scholar, through effort. Those who obscure the Dao act contrary to this, lacking loyalty and filial piety.

What does it mean for the superior scholar to establish loyalty and filial piety through refinement? To lead the world with words. What does it mean for the middling scholar to establish loyalty and filial piety through resolve? To take the lead in conduct. What does it mean for the lesser scholar to achieve loyalty and filial piety through effort? To set an example for the multitude.

Those who do so have their names inscribed in the Southern昌 Upper Palace, their registers entered among the immortals, and the Dao of loyalty and filial piety is thus fulfilled. Those who obscure the Dao act contrary to this, being neither filial nor loyal, and thus fail to complete the Dao. In life, they violate prohibitions; in death, they transgress the laws. Those who violate prohibitions are punished by officials according to established codes. Those who transgress the laws are judged in the unseen realms, facing karmic retribution.

The disloyal incur misfortune from their lords; the unfilial, from their children. The unprincipled suffer disgrace; the reckless, rebellion; the narrow-minded, vexation; the ungenerous, greed and perpetual want. The intolerant provoke many conflicts; the unyielding, self-inflicted harm.

Thus, those who live without integrity—after death, their souls become jesters among men, servile spirits, or beasts of burden. Those who live without courage—after death, their souls become soldiers among men, executed spirits, or the six livestock. From these examples, one may infer the rest.

Therefore, those who know the Dao revere these principles, guarding their hearts and sincerely embracing the eight directions. Establishing the eight directions as a foundation, one builds upon this foundation to illuminate one’s nature. When mind and nature are illuminated, one does not seek the numinous, yet the numinous is naturally numinous—this is called purity and clarity.

In the practice of purity and clarity, loyalty and filial piety are the practice; when the Dao of loyalty and filial piety is perfected, what is purity? Not being stained by things. What is clarity? Not being obstructed by things. Unstained and unobstructed, loyalty and filial piety are naturally attained. Living thus, dying thus. When loyalty and filial piety are established, mind and nature are attained.
