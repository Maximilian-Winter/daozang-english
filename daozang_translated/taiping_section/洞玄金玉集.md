**Fascicle One of The Dongxuan Jin Yu Collection**
*Composed by the Perfected of Pure Serenity and Non-Action of Kunlun, True Man Ma of Danyang*

**Seven-character quatrains**

The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct and Compassionate Transformation of Chongyang, while dwelling in a hut on Mount Kunyu, fashioned a headscarf from a bolt of blue cloth three and a half feet in length, folding it nine times and stitching it nine seams. In a dream, he once beheld it, calling it the *Ninefold Transformed Huayang Scarf*. His master’s bearing was majestic, resembling that of Zhongli, and with this scarf bound upon his head, his radiance and refinement only deepened—truly a man beyond the world of things. Thus, these verses were composed in praise:

His countenance mirrors Zhongli’s treasured form,
Naturally poised, his spirit refined and bright.

**How could one know he is not a wanderer of the red dust?**
*It is the Ninefold Transformed Huayang Scarf of blue cloth.*

**In Praise of Chongyang’s Perfected of Wondrous Conduct and Compassionate Transformation**
A cloud-wrought crown, a rosy cape, a crimson sash—
His form enters the radiant sphere, apart from the Purple Clarity.
The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct fulfills his primal vow,
Rescuing the imperiled, saving the suffering, ferrying all beings.

**Following the Rhyme of Perfected Chongyang**
He dwells not in towns nor villages,
Thinks not of wife, son, or grandson.
His resolve lies in circling the walls to cultivate the Great Dao,
Turning the jade gate to enter the golden portal.

**Expressing My Thoughts**
Thirty years within the gate of Confucian learning,
Yet not one word as vast as heaven did I know.
By chance, I awakened to the principles of the Wind Immortal—
Suddenly, numinous clarity filled the boundless cosmos.

**Again**
A realm of immortals, vast and formless,
Lofty and vaulted, a heaven of one’s own.
In broad daylight, at ease without trivial affairs,
One soars through the cinnabar clouds, riding the mist.

**Again**
A carefree wanderer of the Three Mountains,
An unbound immortal, at ease and unconstrained.
In purity, one turns the scenes within the pot,
In non-action, one treads and shatters the heavens within the cave.

**Matching the Rhyme of the Second Young Master of the Medicine King of Chang’an**
Cloud-roaming, I crossed waters past Zhongmou,
Where I met the great praise of Master Chongyang.
He permitted me to return in perfect clarity,
Among the thirty-six Perfected of the Grotto-Heavens.

**[Ten Quatrains]**
When Perfected Chongyang wished to journey to Ninghai, he personally drew a painting and entrusted it to his disciple, Master Shi of Liquan County, to keep in secret.

Yu dreamed beforehand of a crane emerging from the earth in the Southern Garden. A month later, Master Chongyang arrived, pointing to where the crane had risen and instructing that a hut be built there.

Yu further dreamed of following his master into a mountain. The next day, his master bestowed upon him the childhood name *Shantong*.

Xuan followed his master to Nanjing. As the year drew to a close, the master prepared to depart the world.

Yu sought to leave the world in distress.
The master said: *"I have already written of this beforehand on the wall of Lü the Daoist’s hut in Guanzhong."*

Yu informed the master of his three wishes:
First, to print and circulate the *Complete Perfection Collection* of the master.
The master replied: *"It is already settled in Chang’an."*
Second, to observe mourning for the master for three years.
The master said: *"The old hut site in Liujiang Village will suffice for your dwelling."*
Third, to exhort parents of all directions to cast off the mundane and cultivate immortality.
The master said: *"Enough. Ascend in rosy clouds."*

I parted ways at Daliang, passed through Luoyang, entered Tong Pass, crossed Mount Hua, and visited Jingzhao. A Daoist friend urged me to stay, and I lingered for several days in Master Kong’s hut.

Master Shi of Liquan came seeking me, and we met at the tea house by the eastern gate. When asked his name, he said: *"I am Shi Fengzi of Liquan, also a disciple of Perfected Chongyang."* Hearing this, I rejoiced greatly, for the master had often spoken of his worth.

After tea, I strolled idly beneath the Taiping Tower. Daoist friend Yang the Second invited me to stay, and as we sipped tea, Master Shi arrived. He again offered bows, but I reproved him: *"Since you are a disciple of Master Chongyang, why so many courtesies? How can a Daoist live by bowing two or three times a day?"*

I knew beforehand that this gentleman feared begging in the streets, so I sought to provoke him. I wished to share a pot of wine with him, but the host was unsure. Master Shi drew coins from his robe, but I said: *"No need for these. Go to the streets, beg for money, and buy wine."* After staring for a while, he went to beg and returned with wine. I drank alone, and when he asked for a poem, I composed ten quatrains to bestow upon him:

*What shame is there in a walking corpse and moving bones?*
*Do not let clothing and food stir up needless sorrow.*
*Learn from me—stretch your arms in the streets,*
*Begging as you go, most free and refined.*

**Again**
*Wealth and honor are but trifles,*
*While life and nature are as vast as heaven.*
*Fire, wind, earth, and water are like floating bubbles—*
*First see through this illusory body.*

**Again**
*Today, I truly meet a worthy one,*
*Do not let household affairs create karmic debt.*
*Subdue your self and go begging—*
*Daily life will naturally become effortless.*

**Again**
*Ma Feng does not love the wine in the cup,*
*But leads you to stretch your hands idly in the streets.*
*Pass the days as you will, aiding the Dao’s growth,*
*No need to concoct medicine to idle away your mouth.*

**Again**
*Take this coarse wine to aid my spirit,*
*Rely on the jade nectar to nourish your celestial truth.*
*Who knows that the drunker one becomes, the more clear and free?*
*One day, your merit complete, you’ll be a person of the Three Isles.*

**Again**
*No wife, no son, no daughter—*
*Heaven grants you carefree ease; best to awaken.*
*Do not deceive your heart or mock others,*
*For unseen spirits ever watch over you.*

**Again**
*Let go of all you once cherished,*
*Hasten to withdraw and seek beyond the world.*
*What you seek is not apart from the inch-square of your heart—*
*Be selfless and upright, and you’ll find a true friend.*

**Again**
*The celestial mechanism dare not be lightly imparted,*
*Observe carefully whether you awaken or not.*
*When hardship comes, forget your home—*
*Then I will point you to the path of longevity.*

**Again**
*Fleeting fame and profit are hard enough to seek;*
*Once gained, you’ll lie in an earthen mound.*
*Do not think immortality a trifling matter—*
*It requires merit and conduct to reach Yingzhou.*

**Again**
*To become an immortal, you must awaken fully,*
*Cast aside the ten thousand worldly ties in one stroke.*
*Always find even your shadow too much—*
*Then you’ll naturally have an immortal to guide you.*

**For the Daoist Friends of Chang’an**
At every household’s gate, the Dao of Chang’an,
In every courtyard, the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
With a single step unmoved, one transcends the dharma-realm,
With three faces all-pervading, one attains cool clarity.

**Matching the Rhyme of Guo Zicong’s Instruction for Chang’an**
Luminous and pure, the divine radiance shines abundantly,
Naturally, the monkey and horse are not driven.
Turning deeper, one awakens to the path of mysterious penetration—
I wonder if Fen Yang has received the message.

**Matching Magistrate Lu’s Rhyme**
A single body becomes the circling wall,
A carefree spirit-child dwells within.
Though mute, it speaks words of profound mystery,
Do not let the monkey and horse run wild.

**For Kong the Elder and His Brother Peng Ziyuan of Chang’an**
At forty-eight, I came to Chang’an,
Seeking the regard of various gentlemen with discerning eyes.
Today, I extend myself to those who know me—
Speaking of cultivation, I reveal the coiled dragon and tiger.

**Again**
Hut-master Kong and Peng Ziyuan,
Along with all Daoist kin, early sought the mysterious.

Within the body, the fire of long life nourishes,
Within the crucible, the everlasting sky is perfected.

**Again**
Heart clear, intent pure, nature roams free,
Unfettered and unbound, the waist unburdened.
If you wish lead and mercury to conjoin within the furnace,
First harmonize the inner elixir of the cauldron.

**Again**
Cast aside worldly ties, let all affairs cease,
Naturally, the true cause is grasped.
The vital and harmonious essence pierces the cinnabar cave,
The awakened spirit-child ascends the jade tower.

**Again**
Unmoved by external pleasures, untouched by greed or wrath,
Blending with the world, radiant in speech and laughter.
I only wish that all gentlemen share my resolve—
Together we cultivate and ascend as immortals.

**Again**
Roaming beyond the mundane, the spirit is fortified,
Free from care, forgetting schemes, uniting with the supreme truth.
Realize that non-contention marks the highest adept,
Ever embracing forbearance, one becomes an immortal.

**Again**
Daoist joy is most fitting,
Passionately fond of song and revelry, utterly enchanted.
In purity and stillness lies true delight,
Naturally, sleeves dance into the clouds.

**Again**
On Sanji Mountain, the rustic refines the great elixir,
Within the jade furnace, snow blankets all.
Awakened, one no longer flaunts a bearded might,
But humbly invites others to look with discerning eyes.

**Again**
Awakened, one feels no shame in begging for scraps,
How could fame or profit sway my being?
I urge all gentlemen to relinquish attachment,
And swiftly follow Ma Yu in seeking the formless.

**Again**
Swiftly focus the mind, restrain the monkey-heart,
Circulate the pure and void, let metal and wood flow.
Through ninefold refinement, the great medicine is perfected,
Forever as immortal kin, dwelling on Yingzhou.

**Inscribed at the Hall of Reverence for Antiquity, Office of the Military Commissioner of Jingzhao, for Secretary Wang Qingu**

Master Wang’s nature ever reveres antiquity,
Within his hall, dragons and tigers idly harmonize.
Day by day, month by month, inversion is achieved,
Naturally, the embryonic immortal dances forth.

**Again**
Master Qingu’s visage is ancient,
Having awakened to the lofty dragon and the watery tiger.
He submits to the wondrous mystery within the supreme principle,
Daring to dance with Ma and Feng upon the streets.

**Again**
Master Qingu upholds the primordial,
Before heaven and earth, the true dragon and tiger.
Emerging from height, entering the depths, east or west at will,
Startling the elixir-child to dance in response.

**Again**
Master Qingu comprehends the eternal,
Nurturing dragon and tiger within the formless.
Clear and pure, the primordial origin is revealed,
The carefree spirit-child dances before all.

**At Mafang, Visiting Lecturer Li the Younger Reading the *Nanhua Jing***

To seek texts and trace antiquity is to know much,
Yet awakening to the *Nanhua* deepens the mystery.
Better to cast aside the ten thousand entanglements,
Struggle free to grasp the one and ascend the celestial ladder.

**For Abbot Liu of Mafang Hermitage**

With whole heart enter the Dao, reaching the journey’s end,
The two qi harmonized, gathered with utmost care.
The three treasures—essence, spirit, qi—conjoin,
Through the four seasons, converging toward Yingzhou.

**For Little Zhang of Hu County**

When the young one asks of the Dao, the Dao remains wordless,
Yet purity sustains the most wondrous mystery.
Rely on this ancestral way, ever preserved,
Naturally, one has the destiny to become a divine immortal.

**For Little Wang of Hu County**

Young one, listen to the nurturing of the spirit-child,
By karmic cause, you follow the Ma-Feng lineage.
Through non-action and purity, awaken fully,
Naturally, your cloud-steps reach Penglai Palace.

**For Xu Qingshen of Qingzhen**

Ever entangled in the fiery household, never seeing the end,
A single body vainly bears a family’s sorrows.
Even if you settle all for them, it remains unsettled—
Better to still the heart and cease at once.

**For Wu Jieyuan of Hu County**

I encountered immortals, others encountered me,
Yet they remain like me, consumed by smoke and fire.
Nurturing qi, preserving truth, unstained by dust,
Naturally, one has the destiny to bear immortal fruit.

**For Duwu the Fifth of Hu County**

To cultivate immortality, first subdue self and ego,
Then within the waters, nurture the true fire.
Intent diminished, heart forgotten, without a speck of dust,
The elixir of nature congeals, the fruit of success ripens.

**Passing the Hanpi Verdant Hall in the Hu Countryside, Composed for Liang the Maiden of Yaozhou**

Form is emptiness, emptiness is form,
Form and emptiness both forgotten.
Since awakening to the form within emptiness,
Suddenly, the heart-lotus exudes jade-green fragrance.

**For Magistrate Pei of Li Springs**

Before your eyes, children grow into adults,
Their whiskers and beards like tarnished silver.
Do not blame my haggard and worn appearance—
They have stolen my finest spirit.

**For Master He of Chunhua, Gift of a Mottled Bamboo Staff as Travel Provision**

A single stalk, truly a dragon-transforming timber,
Struck to vanquish the three corpses, demons, and specters.
Blood-stained, mottled like tortoiseshell,
I gift it to you, to bear on your journey to Penglai.

**On the Lower Prime Day of the Ding-You Year, Exiting the Encircled Wall**

Dancing thus, truly hastened,
Recognizing the eternal origin’s true visage.
Master Father and Master Uncle descend to the world,
The auspicious moment directly pointed to the northwest.

**Reunion**

Master Father Chongyang, the Wondrous-Acting Perfected of Compassionate Transformation,
Master Uncle Yuchan, the Pure and Serene Perfected of Universal Clarity.
Having just passed Fufeng, I turned back in haste,
Specially visiting Qiyang to boast of my discerning eyes.
Again encountering my original master, obtaining the great elixir,
He instructed me to establish east, west, south, and north.

**On the Twenty-Eighth Day of the Mid-Winter Month, Re-Entering the Encircled Wall**

The wind howls, the wind-horse departs,
Roaming the northwest clouds for over a month.
Yet longing for my former retreat, I return,
Leaping once more into the encircled wall.

**Sealing the Doors and Windows**

From Kunyu, Sanji, and Ma Mountain, the rustic,
I firmly seal the doors and windows ninefold.
Revolving Kan and Li, Geng and Jia,
Unconcerned with south or north, east or west.

**[Quatrain]**

In the early winter of the Wuyin year of the Dading era, I journeyed from Longmen to the Taihe Hermitage in Huating, staying over ten days, intending to brush my sleeves and head for Kongtong.
On that day, I lingered only in the eastern quarters, staying one or two days at Master Gong’s hermitage.
At the time, there were Liu Zhaoxin, Pei Daqi, Li Dacheng, and over ten fellow Daoists from the city and suburbs.
I exhorted them through the night, yet not one turned their heart toward the Dao.
The next day, about to depart, I left this quatrain:

The cinnabar-refined Yang’s jade nature unfolds,
Cloud-roaming the northwest, selecting immortal timber.
The brocade-scaled fish eludes the empty cast,
I reel in my line and return.

**Li Dacheng of the Fishing Middle, Again Using the Previous Rhyme**

The foolish one’s nature suddenly opens wide,
A single spark of numinous yang, called chosen timber.
Let no dust or grime dim the heart,
In clarity, transmit the wondrous mystery.

**Four More Poems for Li Dacheng**

You’ve hooked the lost from the sea of suffering,
Together we walk and sit, freely roaming.
Entrusting the true within the heart, refining nature,
Attaining the wondrous, penetrating the mysterious, we wander the ten isles.

Once more, joyful that the worthy turns their head to join the current,
Awakening to wander the world within the gourd.
Clouds and waters require no toil of foot,
Naturally step by step one reaches Penglai Isle.

Once more,
Unfettered and carefree, flowing as one with the Dao,
Not following fame or profit, roaming beyond the dust.
Before returning to the cinnabar clouds of the celestial grotto,
First tread the Jasper Isle within the gourd.

Once more,
How fares the Great Vehicle’s harmonized essence?
Unattached, far surpassing all else uncelebrated.
Nature like a solitary cloud or lone crane,
Free and at ease—nothing surpasses this.

**Returning the Black Cap to Magistrate Zhao**
Carving through darkness, cleaving ignorance, no longer foolish,
Able to distinguish black from white, the jade nature crimson.
Master Wumao awakens to the bright moon,
The Red Pine Immortal scorns the pure wind.

**[Quatrain]**
Li Jichuan dreamed of receiving a quatrain from Master Cuan, and I thus matched it in praise:
Master Cuan once bowed to me as teacher,
His will steadfast, never for a moment wavering.
After the cicada’s molt, roots clearly seen,
By chance he descended to the world and left behind these verses.

**To Abbot Zhang Dawu of Huating County**
Upright words must be heeded,
Refine the root, solidify the source, qi steadies the spirit.
If the horse and monkey remain unruly,
Guard against unforeseen calamity befalling the body.

**To a Daoist Friend of Huating County**
Horse-like wind, compassionate vows emulating Vimalakīrti,
Ever grieving for the multitudes suffering deeply.
Exhortations in verse, if awakened to,
Spare them from rushing into fire like moths.

**To Madame He, Wife of Jiao Gong**
Youth has passed, yet still clinging to the boudoir,
Pity the deluded, unaware of autumn’s approach.
Before becoming utterly withered and worn,
Seek the wondrous mystery early, don the lotus crown soon.

**On the Winter Solstice, Gifting Charcoal to Vice Prefect Li Zhenguo of Longzhou**
Yang revives, the year renews,
I laugh at the poet’s excessive toil.
Breathing on the brush, madly chanting, inscribing jade slips,
Every thought and impulse—charcoal for dark fuel.

Once more,
Heaven’s Dao offers two paths to humanity,
In winter’s month, none are spared.
Scorching heat, proud qi mingling with ice,
In a poor hut’s cold stillness, even fire feels chill.

**Thanking Liu Sanlang of Longzhou for the Sheepskin Robe**
Frost clouds uniform, no variation,
Six-petaled flakes drift, sealing the old pass.
Deep gratitude to the true Daoist friend from Pengcheng,
Gifting me this fur robe to withstand winter’s cold.

**Parting from Longzhou**
Water and clouds wander by rule,
Flowing or reversing, none can fathom.
Within, revolving the mechanism of heaven and earth,
Comprehending the root source, truly one attains.

**On the Twenty-Ninth Day of the Seventh Month, Gengzi Year, Inscribed on the Eastern Wall of the Southern Dipper Pavilion at Taiping Palace, Zhongnan**
Fleeting as wind harms a speck of dust—gone,
Who would rush about like me?
The awakened turn their heads, grasp the wondrous,
Naturally, Penglai Isle is the journey’s course.

**On the Twenty-Fourth Day of the Eighth Month, Gengzi Year, Praying for Rain in Chang’an**
Barefoot, horse-like wind, praying for rain,
Heart’s incense curls toward the immortal court.
When will the plow receive its due moisture?
Five fives never stray from twenty-five.

Once more,
Shoots wither, the myriad people grieve,
Burning heart’s incense, auspicious qi rises.
Praying again, the Three Perfected descend together,
A sudden downpour—autumn’s harvest assured.

**Encountering a Crane While Visiting Gu Moke’s Study**
Cloud companions, rosy friends attend the feast,
Step by step, Gui Peak before me.
I seek the guest by the green lotus pool,
Others see the yellow crane’s immortal from the grotto.

**[Quatrain]**
Abbot Wuchang of Wutai came to serve tea, asking:
“They say clouds drift in azure skies, water rests in a vase—how so?”
The Moon Master spoke of ancients’ words,
“Clouds in azure skies, water in a vase.”
I understood: water and clouds reversed,
A stream’s wind and moon, wine just sobered.

**Matching Rhymes with Zhao Dianshi of Qiyang Town**
Ox, deer, and sheep carts overturned,
Few hold discourse, few act.
Having met and received direct transmission,
How could I deceive the parents of the ten directions?

Once more,
Two wheels swiftly come and go,
I ask myself—how many years?
Studying the *Yi*, past the age of hearing,
Yet stubbornly refusing my old wife’s deceit.

Once more,
Different names must be discussed in many ways,
Do not say they are unrelated to the mysterious.
If a scholar is swayed by wind and horse,
Naturally, he will not heed the pillow’s deceit.

Once more,
Nine-turning effort lies in the workings,
Do not say delving into the wondrous is irrelevant.
The profound principle is hard for people to grasp,
Before attaining clarity, endure the deceit.

Once more,
Abandoning that, clinging to this,
Loving the immortal’s essence, enduring shame.
Wood and metal’s threefold mystery,
Not wild words or clever deceit.

Once more,
Kan and Li exchange positions, circulating,
Coming and going, not externally.
I wish to confide in those who know me,
But others cling, calling it foolish.

Once more,
The Dao’s law is naturally distinct,
The wondrous mystery attained through sincerity.
Heaven’s mechanism is profound, not the common Dao,
Without meeting a true teacher, all is deceit.

Once more,
I have awakened to this and that,
Regardless of others’ concern or indifference.
Learning the Dao stems from true attainment,
Deceiving others is self-deception.

Once more,
Dragons and snakes rise from land, qi surging,
Sun and moon share a palace, not the ten stems.
Following this cultivation, immortality is certain,
Do not say Ma Yu deceives others.

Once more,
Immortal scriptures speak of refining and holding,
Yet deluded people refuse to act.
Managing household affairs in the mundane world, boasting of enlightenment,
Clearly, one deceives one’s own heart.

**Matching Rhymes with the Silver Brothers of Yaozhou**
Meeting the profound, interest endures,
Heart opens, awakens—best to leave the world.
Indolent at ease, forming true delight,
Laughable, the busy unaware of their busyness.

**Matching Rhymes Again, Purchasing from the Hou Brothers of Hezhong**
Within the gourd, refining, emerald clouds lengthen,
Repairing gardens and pavilions, no night in that land.
Seizing the flying crow and running hare,
Naturally, sun and moon are unhurried.

**Matching Rhymes with Magistrate Lei of Shuzheng County**
Your reputation surpasses Su Qin’s,
Unlike those who conceal their light, hiding their names.
Beyond things, carefree and truly unconstrained,
From the beginning, a single point is naturally bright.

Once more,
Stillness and clarity are the elixir of longevity,
Abandoning wife and children, no oral transmission.
After awakening, knowing emptiness, not clinging to existence,
Naturally, good causes and conditions are attained.

**On New Year’s Day**
Spring and summer return, autumn also shifts,
Last night’s lingering year-end swept away by the wind.

New Year’s Day, people say we gain a year,
I say this floating life loses one instead.

**For Liu Mengsong, Palace Examination Graduate of Gaoling**
Dreaming aright, you kept the eighteen elders whole,
Yet how could this compare to one spiritually attuned?
Majestic and radiant, worldly dust cannot stain,
Vast and dignified, your nature remains unvoid.

**Admonition to Spring Excursionists**
Seeking blossoms, chasing emeralds in lavish display,
How could you pause to sigh for falling flowers?
If you awaken to the truth of flourishing and decay,
Turn back beyond the world to refine cinnabar.

**Matching Xiao Pu’s “Affairs of the Garden” – A Warning to Sightseers**
Within the gourd, refinement yields eternal spring,
Yet you, in the fourth month, chase blossoms and green.
Cease your infatuation with butterflies’ frivolous dance,
Lest the flower’s allure ensnare your very being.

**Again**
Diligently tending the fire, you cling to grafting,
Never ceasing the sweet nectar upon lips and teeth.
With resolve, cultivate truth and banish sleep’s demon,
Without attachment to the false, tend the primal leaf.

**Inscribed on a Paper Fan**
Emotions severed, passions forgotten in stillness,
The heart bright, the spirit manifest—white plantain.
As jade-like radiance sways, a pure breeze arrives,
No need for frost-white silk to dispel summer’s heat.

**On Pomegranate Blossoms**
The courtyard ablaze with pomegranates red as fire,
Mocking peach and plum that chase fleeting bubbles.
Who knows that chrysanthemums by the eastern fence at frost’s dawn
Will blaze in fragrant splendor, claiming autumn alone?

**Quatrain**
For the Lord of Jingye Manor by White Horse River, who bestowed a crooked bamboo staff
Crooked and curved, destined to become a dragon’s timber,
Deep thanks for your noble gift to me.
One day, when the work is complete and truth fully realized,
I’ll ascend the clouds to visit Penglai with it in hand.

**Quatrain**
Lamenting how people only know to eat and defecate,
Never pausing to attend to their nature and life.
The grain cart enters, the dung cart departs,
This endless cycle—when will it end?
Even if granted a lifespan of a hundred years,
It amounts to no more than thirty-six thousand days.

**Quatrain**
People cling to a couplet from the ancients:
*“First, you must experience all worldly affairs,
Then seek the mechanism of transcendence.”*
Yet this principle is not entirely sound.
Worldly affairs are boundless, without end,
To claim you’ve “experienced them all” is itself a fallacy.

Do better to see through all attachments as nothingness,
Then naturally you penetrate the mysterious and grasp the wondrous mechanism.

**Admonition to the Foolish**
Alas, how foolish people are—
Dwelling in a fiery house, they seek a red-hot furnace.
Not only do they fail to reach a place of coolness,
How can they escape the stench and filth of the ditch?

**Admonition to the Wicked**
A deep sigh for the wicked,
Who rely on power to bully others for their own amusement.
Day by day, their stubborn hearts breed evil;
In the end, how will they withstand the torments of the evil realms?

**The Sixteen Battlegrounds**
Fire, wind, earth, and water bind the skin-sack;
The four demon-kings of eye, ear, nose, and tongue.
Self and others, right and wrong sow the seeds of karma;
Qi, wealth, wine, and lust—these are the execution grounds of men.

**Distinguishing Right from Wrong**
Wind, flowers, snow, and moon bring no true benefit;
Wine, lust, anger, and wealth are all enemies.
Self and others, right and wrong summon ghostly destinies;
Only in pure tranquility and virtue does the immortal’s boat ferry one across.

**Urging Resolute Entry into the Dao**
Silken blades, felt arrows, paper spears—
How can these seize the immortal’s banner and join the Dao’s current?
A true man of resolve and courage,
To escape life and death, must turn his gaze at once.

**To Fellow Daoists**
If your heart is set on entering the Dao, do not delay,
Lest procrastination age the worthy before their time.
Today’s affairs are unknown by tomorrow;
How dare one presume upon next year?

**Again**
The path to long life is worth pursuing,
Yet impermanence is better for stilling the heart.
Roaming like clouds and water, seek good companions,
And naturally, you will encounter true kindred spirits.

**Instructing Disciples**
Every thought and worry harms the spirit;
How dare one linger in the dust of entanglements?
Cutting off the ten thousand conditions, all is illusion;
Cultivating the one nature, the whole truth is perfected.

**Again**
On the mountain of self and others lies the pass of life and death;
I urge you to topple the mountain of self and others.
Once self and others are removed, the heart’s nature becomes good,
And naturally, you leap beyond the pass of life and death.

**Again**
To illuminate the original, primal point of light,
First still the monkey and horse of mind and intent.
When heart, essence, and will are pure, the three cinnabar fields unite;
The tiger emerges, the dragon coils—four images complete.

**To Li Jichuan**
Hidden talents, keen and sharp, not to be called foolish,
A true man boldly casts aside glory and splendor.
Daring to forsake wife and children, a man of true resolve,
With the will to cultivate virtue and power, he is called my disciple.

**To Sister Lu**
A single surge to the heavens, the lamp of wisdom shines bright;
Auspicious smoke of the Eight Trigrams billows forth.
The ninefold refined golden elixir perfects the jade nature,
And the jeweled path of the Ten Continents lies open for travel.

**To Sister Xue of Songxi, the Recluse**
The greatest taboo in cultivation is extravagance;
Shatter every attachment to refine wheat and hemp.
Reversing and cycling yin and yang to penetrate creation,
Naturally, the furnace yields the great cinnabar.

**To Sister Chai**
Great cultivation lies in non-action and non-doing;
With intent stilled and heart cleansed, the lamp of wisdom shines.
Illuminating the nine passes to freely enter and exit,
On Kunlun’s peak, one ascends in ascent.

**To Sister Yan of Shuangxi, the Recluse**
With whole heart enter the Dao and never turn back;
The eight flavors of jade nectar nourish the great elixir.
The nine luminaries harmonize to form the true jade nature,
And with full merit, one ascends the immortal’s altar.

**Quatrain**
After the capital’s decree sent me forth,
I returned home, composing this poem to thank the Commander-in-Chief.
This rustic from Sanji Mountain, having met with fortune,
Came to Qin’s land to refine the clouds and waves.
Reflecting, I take myself back home—
Better to request a blade in the hall than remain.

**Quatrain**
Since the decree compelled my departure,
I had no choice but to bid farewell to the capital, hence this poem.
On the stage of fame and profit, one struts with vanity;
How could one willingly still the heart and cultivate beyond the world?
Do not blame me for reeling in my fishing rod;
I know my humble verse cannot match a mighty hook.

**To An Gong of Hezhong Prefecture**
Master An must awaken to the eternal Chang’an,
And turn that awakening inward as contemplation.
Let heart and intent not follow the monkey and horse’s turns;
When qi and spirit harmonize, the numinous elixir forms.

**Quatrain**
Passing through Huangyang Inn, I met Scholar Wang,
Who spoke of Huang Yingqing’s palace examination at fifty-three, with a poem of self-praise.
I borrowed his rhyme and composed ten quatrains.
Carrying scrolls of the *Dao and Virtue* and *Yin Talismans*,
With star crown and moon mantle, my cloud robe gleams.
The world does not recognize this wanderer of mist and rosy clouds,
Mistaking the topknot of a wind-tossed immortal for demonic obstruction.

**Again**
With elixir scriptures in my belly, no need to carry them;
A hempen robe and paper jacket outshine brocade.
Now I brush my sleeves and return to Ninghai,
Thirteen companions of the Dao roam the clouds with me.

**Again**
I vow never to carry jade twists or golden willows;
With a carefree heart, I wear a short hat and light robe.
Persecuted by officials for cultivating truth and exhorting goodness,
This is the third time I’ve been summoned hence.

**Quatrain**

At Jingyuan Garrison in Guo Prefecture, as well as the capital and Gan River Garrison, demonic obstructions have already struck thrice.

**Again**
Shoulders bear the weight of layered eaves, yet the heart remains unburdened;
I cast off ties to children and grandchildren, discarding even my robe.
Awakened to the sixfold clarity of six-by-six,
First the threefold realization, then the threefold verification.

**Again (Hidden Head)**
□-like mysteries need not be carried,
□-transmitted secrets render green robes obsolete.
□-within, the Great Elixir is perfected,
□-whirling, the Six Harmonies revolve in threes.
*(Disassemble one character to begin.)*

**Again**
Family burdens weigh heavy on layered eaves,
Shuttling back and forth to trade furs and robes.
Soon to fall once more into the deep pit,
How to kindle the alchemical furnace’s triple fire?

**Again**
Abandoning all household ties, never to bear them again,
Mouth speaks of mysteries, never of robes.
Clad in felt and wool, the heart holds fast to the Dao,
Originally an infant, free from the trinity of cares.

**To Registrar Xue of Wuzhi County**
Suddenly awakened, the heart bears no fiery trials,
A hempen robe surpasses silken finery.
Preserve the principle of purity and non-action,
Refining essence, qi, and spirit into the Triple Treasure.

**Again**
Leaping from the fiery pit, no home to bear,
A carefree straw cloak outshines any robe.
Roaming the cloud-water path to Penglai Isle,
The Great Elixir naturally coalesces in threes.

**Exhorting the Butcher of Qimen**
The karmic debt of slaughter must be borne,
Next life’s rebirth forfeits even a robe.
To dissolve this enmity, change your trade—
Follow the example of Zhao Si and Zhang San.

**To Daoist Friends in Kaizhou**
The Horse Wind blows east, the decision comes from the west,
Let the Daoist lords ponder this riddle.
Reencountering Master Chongyang’s extraordinary net,
We ride the clouds together to Penglai.

**Matching a Daoist Friend’s Rhyme**
Seeing through this floating life, it is thus,
Yet the body’s shadow still feels excessive.
Wherever cloud-roaming leads, the path to mystery opens,
Guiding all from the waves of suffering.

**Upon Seeing Magistrate Li San of Zizhou Holding a White Plantain Fan**
The Horse Wind’s encounter brings boundless ease,
Unfettered and unrestrained, no belt to bind the waist.
The true nature’s fragrance lingers like old red hibiscus,
The frost-hearted white plantain unfurls its leaves.

**Continuing Master Geng of Weizhou’s Rhyme**
The Horse Wind met a living immortal,
Within the cave, perfecting one’s own heaven.
Dragon and tiger coil afar, beholding the moon of nature,
Horse and ape settle in stillness, savoring the lotus of the heart.

**Quatrain**
As Daoist friends from Changle saw me off on my journey,
We reached the foot of Solitary Mountain and beheld immortal traces on the stone.
I then composed a brief ode, presenting it to the tea-tasting assembly and all Daoist friends:
Each vies to glimpse immortal traces,
Who would willingly follow in my footsteps?
With single-minded transcendence beyond the mundane,
One naturally gains the destiny to tread the cloud-path.

**Quatrain**
To Vice Magistrate of Laizhou and Attendant Tu Dan, who presented an ancient poem:
Yesterday, I chanced to read it and continued in the original rhyme—may you deign to peruse it.
The furnace-refined elixir is priceless,
In the hermitage, herbs were never bartered for coin.
Yesterday’s guest arrived with a discerning eye,
This morning, I keep company with the white clouds in slumber.

**Matching Ren Gong’s Rhyme**
Through mysterious cultivation, the original true self is nurtured,
Virtue is never solitary—it must have neighbors.
With intent purified, one knows the elixir does not leak,
With heart cleansed, who would believe the nature is unstained?

**To Master Ma Congshi of Huiguang Hermitage in Xigao Village, Huang County**
Forsaking wealth to accumulate blessings, blessings like mountains,
Yet rebirth remains inescapable, coming and going in cycles.
Only when body and mind are pure within and without,
Is there no birth or death, no swift revolutions.

**Incantation for the Withered Bamboo of Quanzhen Hermitage in Huang County**
The Daoist gate is called Longevity,
Intent on withering and transforming form.
May these few stalks remain ever-green,
Not a single leaf allowed to lose its verdure.

**Delighted by the Living Pine**
I master the art of life, revolving and generating,
Qi spreads through the body, transmuting form.
Beyond the window, not only the gentleman’s green,
Before the hermitage, the great man’s verdancy brings joy.

**Quatrain**
On the third day of the sixth lunar month, Dingmao year of the Dading era,
Daoist friends of Huang County invited me to reside in the walled enclosure of Jinyu Hermitage,
where six young pines were newly planted. I composed three quatrains:
In the sixth month before the hermitage, six pines are planted,
The Horse Wind whirls in reverse, as if overturned.
Thrice infusing qi, strength is meager,
Yet the six aspirations revive with great merit.

**Again**
At the height of summer’s dog days, pines are planted,
Daoist friends idly test the Horse Wind.
I say these six saplings will not survive on their own,
But legend speaks of the true merit of the Triple Topknot.

**Again**
On the third day of the sixth month, six small pines are planted,
Their hues shift in the gusting wind.
I pray to borrow Chongyang’s qi,
That they may fulfill the famed merit of the Triple Topknot.

**Continuing the Rhyme of Cangshi of Dengzhou**
Threading the pearl requires clarity,
A gentle fire compels qi to transmit.
The nine orifices illuminated, the Dao’s fruit is attained,
The Three Lights harmoniously shine, a fine affinity gained.

**Continuing the Rhyme of Zhu Tongjian of Dengzhou**
Mercury and lead meet, hastened by effort,
Infant and maiden unite without a matchmaker.
Jade tiger and golden dragon soar earthward,
Golden crow and jade hare descend from heaven.

**Matching Sun Gong’s Rhyme for the Palace Examination**
I only wish my kin would early abandon splendor,
Sweep the sleeves and resolutely seek the immortal’s abode.
Sleeping in clouds, lying beneath the moon, drinking rosy dawn,
Golden lotuses with jade blossoms will guide the way.

**Again**
Exhort you to turn back early and know emptiness,
Abandon learning, preserve non-action, and guard the center.
With resolute body and mind like Ma Yu,
One naturally drifts in the true wind.

**Again**
Wish you would swiftly awaken the heart,
Cease chasing fame and profit.
Pursue affairs beyond the mundane, beyond the clouds,
The rootless withered tree will naturally flourish.

**To Instructor Fan of Ninghai**
Instructor Fan, a worthy of our village,
Competes for profit and fame in youthful vigor.
If you grasp the wondrous subtleties of my gate,
Extinguish the heart and repair the heaven within the cave.

**Returning the Gourd and Back-Cloth to Abbot Jiang, with a Poem**
Immortal Feng left behind a gourd,
Abbot Jiang, you are destined to receive it.
Returning your back-cloth, may you awaken,
And emulate my cloud-water roaming in boundless ease.

**To Musician Yang Hezhi**
Cease displaying cleverness before others,
Better to recognize the luminous within your nature.
Calm the heart, dispel desires—spirit becomes manifest,
Attaining residence in Penglai’s first palace.

**Exchanging the Long Balustrade for Tian Xi’s Walking Staff**
A single crooked piece, transformed into dragon material,
Exchanged for a bamboo staff far surpassing wealth.
Each idly embraces poetic inspiration as it arises,
Cleaving open the true nature to reveal immortal talent.

**To Candle Discipline Master, Gift of a Staff**
Great-Uncle Haichan bore a precious staff,
Its merit complete, cloud-steps transcend the Three Realms.
To whom did Ma Feng pass this delight?
To Candle Discipline Master, truly at ease.

**Expressing My Feelings**
Three topknots like Kun arrows—Ma Feng, my brother,
Cloud-water drifting, ever thus.
Cultivating pearls and treasures, I ever regret their scarcity,
Yet gazing at my shadow, I find it all too abundant.

**Composed at Fan Mingshu’s Residence on the Twenty-First Day of the Ninth Month, Renyin Year**
Grasping the essentials, purifying the numinous terrace,
Mist-locked and smoke-veiled, it would not open.
Reencountering Master Chongyang’s guidance,
A clear wind blows forth the bright moon.

**Following Qi Dacheng’s Rhyme**
The master’s name bears three coiled topknots,
With earnest intent, ponder the tender heart.
No attachment to the dusty world’s adorned scenes,
Only the Dao’s flavor surpasses sweet citrus.

**Again**
Having met Fengxian’s three disciples,
Transcendent beyond things, we ponder together.
Only then do I know the joy of ease and freedom,
And truly trust in the bliss of serene contentment.

**Again**
With Tan, Liu, and Qiu—three fellow disciples—
Alongside me, they exhort the world to ponder the Dao.
Phoenixes dance and simurghs soar, spirit-light piercing,
Tigers roam and dragons coil—great medicine sweet.

**Again**
Within the Eight Trigrams furnace, refining six and three,
Through mystery and wonder, no need for pondering.
Water births crimson flames, enhancing divine radiance,
Fire nurtures blue lotuses, dripping dew’s sweetness.

**Again**
Refining essence, qi, and spirit into three treasures,
How could I think of fleeting ledgers or beards to ponder?
Bearing the light, tending the fire-court—no suffering,
Having tasted the elixir’s measure, even labor is sweet.

**Again**
A woman’s heart harbors three venomous serpents,
The awakened turn their light inward to ponder.
Extracting oneself from desire, knowing bitterness upon bitterness,
In clarity, savoring the taste—sweetness upon sweetness.

**Again**
Scholars Qi Two and Li Three,
With their *zhi*, *hu*, *zhe*, *ye*, cease such pondering.
Playing with literary livelihoods, they know it as suffering,
Studying the Dao’s way of life, they find it sweet.

**Again, to the Young Disciples Below the Hall**
Ox, deer, and sheep carts convey the three,
Worthy for the young disciples below the hall to ponder.
Accumulated merit’s jade nectar surpasses sugar’s sweetness,
Cultivated conduct’s peaches rival honey’s richness.

*Volume One of the* Cavernous Mystery’s Golden and Jade Collection *concludes*
*Volume Two of the* Cavernous Mystery’s Golden and Jade Collection

**Seven-Character Quatrains: In Response to Yu Tianxi’s Curved Bamboo Staff**

Men all marvel at forsaking fields and gardens,
Yet this staff, borne by the wind, meets Taiyuan’s favor.
The nodal staff, weary of splendor, seeks dismissal—
A single curved bamboo branch returns to the origin.

---

**For the Daoist Friends of Laiyang Who Prepared Sweet Rice Offerings, Composed Thereupon**

The offerings sustain the wind-borne, six-fold heartbreak,
Now consumed, I feel no more attachment.
Within the gourd, strange scenes unlike common sights—
Within the cavern, a clear sky distinct from the world’s.

---

**Song and Dance**

Young disciples lead me in idle song and dance,
Noble gentlemen laugh as I play the fool.
Seeing through floating life, I treat it as a game,
In mad winds, my face conceals an immortal’s guise.

---

**Completion of Merit**

Snapping the reins of fame, free from worldly ties,
Prying open the locks of gain, untouched by dust.
A thousand mornings temper jade from Three Streams,
Nine years’ merit complete—an immortal beyond kalpas.

---

**Upon Receiving an Invitation to Laiyang for the Huanglu Ordination Rites, Presented by High Master Li the Preceptor**

**Poetic Rhymes**

True mindfulness in the cold of three winters’ intercalary moon,
How dare I, in my hut, long for lavish feasts?
The preceptor teases me for coming with a hoe—
Laughing at the lack of alchemical scriptures to moisten the fiery abyss.

---

**Inscribed at the Abbot’s Lodge of Yutuan in Wendeng, Named “Lodge of Harmonious Encounter”**

Fine mountains, fine waters, fine pines and bamboo,
Before the Lodge of Harmonious Encounter, they clear my gaze.
This blessed land deserves the name “Brocade River,”
This grotto heaven befits a celestial dwelling’s roof.

---

**Names of the Pond at the Lodge of Harmonious Encounter in Yutuan**

Jade Blossom, Golden Lotus, Dragon’s Roar, Tiger’s Howl,
Transformed Life, Alchemical Infant, Queen Mother, Grotto Heaven—
Pond of Colored Cloud Bridge, Nine Suns, Perfect Circle.
Jade and gold, dragon and tiger—truly a sight to behold,
Transforming to cradle the infant, the path made smooth.
The Queen Mother’s grotto heaven manifests colored clouds,
Within the Nine Suns’ pond, the elixir attains perfection.

---

**Merit Perfected**

Severing passion, cutting love, free from care’s torment,
Extinguishing thoughts, forgetting schemes, penetrating subtle mystery.
Intent purified, heart’s incense blooms in three realms,
Life’s flow connects, the moon of nature shines full.

I say, “On what day shall I turn eastward?”

**Du of Jingzhao’s Visit**

One day, Magistrate Du of Jingzhao came to call, saying: “A decade ago, I once met the Perfected Lord of Chongyang, who left me a quatrain inscribed on an artificial hill, its hidden head dismantling the character *yun*. The poem read:
*Beneath the clouds, dismantle ‘cloud’—*
*Yun-yun, Anshi shapes the mountain’s part,*
*□ carving lone peaks to stand above the throng.*
I have forgotten the latter two lines. I beg you to complete them for me.” As the request could not be refused, I provisionally filled the command with these lines:
*□ Yun-yun, Anshi shapes the mountain’s part,*
*□ carving lone peaks to stand above the throng.*
*□ Awakened, Taihu’s azure eyes unfold,*

**Enlightenment**

Awakened fully, the heart unfolds—one meets the right person,
Fearing the dust’s toil, I banish all bitterness.
Within water, flame advances—elixir perfected in wonder,
Amid fire, the lotus blooms—Dao reveals its spring.

**Self-Realization**
Fleeting profit, hollow fame lure the wayward,
Toiling endlessly, suffering deepens into deeper pain.
Who knows that power fades like melting snow?
I see glory as but a fleeting spring.

In hardship enduring hardship, compounded pain.
By chance, I met the profound mystery—
How could I cling to home, yearning for prosperous spring?

Why toil endlessly in labor and pain?
Awaken to the immortal blossom, blooming in all seasons,
Cease delusion in the common flowers’ fleeting spring.

Each covets achievement, suffering in pain.
Unknowing that fleeting scenes hasten old age,

Expending my spirit—greater still my pain.
Seizing non-action, hard to grasp being,
Promoting the Great Dao surpasses wandering spring.

Cultivating without suffering, without pain.
Phoenixes soar to Penglai’s scenes,
Tigers roar in dragon palaces—spring in the sea’s depths.

Why speak of deep suffering or deep pain?
In play, finding play—scenes beyond the wall,

A heart entangled in thorns deceives,
Burning incense in vain, enduring pain.
Sever worldly passions, dissolve karma,
Accumulating harmony—spring’s growth renewed.

Upholding pure precepts, avoiding impure pain.
Ever drinking the nectar of enlightenment,
Forever beholding the lotus—no spring’s illusion.

Never have I borne suffering or pain.
Meeting my master, he taught the principle of non-action,

Naturally leaving suffering, leaving pain.
Leisurely observing the eight rivers’ subtle currents,

**Again**
Beyond the world, carefree and at ease,
Neither heart’s suffering nor heart’s pain.
In the furnace, nurturing the cool flame,
In the cauldron, forging the great medicine’s spring.

**To Little Zhang, Registrar of Xianyang, and Fellow Daoists**

Cast aside the man of golden willows, jade bracelets,
Awakened at leisure—would you bear hardship and labor?
Perfected yet without a place of perfection,
Seize the Void, and you seize spring.

**[Quatrain]**
Once more I leave Longhan,
Revisiting Dragon Gate Mountain.
Li Zihe, Provincial Graduate, sees me off—
Together we lodge at the Goudou Fortress inn.
That night, I hear a neighbor’s death, grief unending.
I compose this to gift him:

Ears ever hear the wailing of the dead,
Nose unwittingly drips with bitter sorrow.
To mourn another—how unlike mourning oneself!
Seeing the Dao surpasses eternal spring.

**[Quatrain]**
Li Zihe of Longzhou, Provincial Graduate, enters the Dao,
Given the Dharma name *Great Stem*, styled *Master Spirit-Root*.

**To Zhao Balang of Longzhou**
Astute, clever—yet the most foolish of men,
Toiling for family, enduring bitter labor.
Heed not the century that slips through your hands,

**Seven Poems to Magistrate Xin of Longzhou**
Magistrate Xin of Longzhou, three months in office,
Meets me and urges the study of the Dao.
He says: "I’ve only just received three months’ salary."
Thus I compose these verses.

I. Crane’s cry before the cliff, a man of the thatched hall,
Glad to see one who passed the imperial exams’ toil.
A scholar seeks promotion to the first rank,
A hermit gains no thousand springs of life.

II. Horse and wind—poems from a man of letters,
Each with his own family’s ways, each recounting toil.
A new official’s three months’ salary,
An old friend beyond the world, through countless springs.

III. I shake my head, heedless of others,
Why offer poems and songs with such labor?
Friends of cloud and mist, bound by past vows,
Mending and perfecting the grotto’s spring.

IV. Horse and wind, clinging to past affinities,
Often reciting verses, braving the toil of study.
I urge you: seek early the path to Penglai,
Naturally you’ll gain the reward of Dongting’s spring.

V. These subtle wonders—whom shall I entrust?
Speak to the true friend of former lives’ toil.
Lotus steps open the path of red snow,
Cloud traces lead to the peach blossoms’ spring.

**At Prefect Xiao of Longzhou’s Request, Also Presented to Magistrate Xin**
A man whose heart is tempered and refined,
Speaks to the prefect and magistrate of toil.
One day, should you ascend the Three Isles’ path,
Today you meet the advent of yang’s spring.

**To Zheng Chengde, Magistrate Xin of Longzhou, with Three-Character Lines**
□□ on the Dao’s path—who is permitted?
□□ the Three Dukes, guarding Zheng’s toil.
□□ when promises are made, literary prefaces arise,
□□ singing in harmony with Wuling’s spring.

**To Ma Xuanzhong of Huating**
Shedding family ties, leaving the vulgar,
Naturally spared the toil of suffering.
The Dao cultivated, a thousand layers of karma dissolved,
The elixir refined, ten thousand kalpas’ spring complete.

**To Dong Yushi of Huating, Who Entered the Dao at Thirteen**
Young man, cease calling others strange,
Truly cultivate—do not shrink from toil.
Boast not of black hair before others,
How can you know the mirror’s fleeting youth?

**To Lu Zhourui of Baiyan Town**
Joyful in the Dao, carefree and expansive,
Naturally without labor, without toil.
In the grotto, refine the golden cauldron’s medicine,
Within the gourd, delight in the jade tower’s spring.

**To Zhu Xuanjue of Huaping County**
Clearly I tell the one who leaves the household:
Renounce the foul, spurn the five pungents’ toil.
Cease seeking long vision from me,
Return beyond the world to inquire of eternal spring.

**To Zheng Shanxin**
Beyond the world, carefree and at ease,
Harmonizing *jia*, *yi*, *geng*, and *xin*.
In the grotto, ever with the immortals,
Within the gourd, idly observing ageless spring.

**To Zhao Zhirou of Huaping County**
Fiercely turn back, a man beyond the world,
Spared ten thousand sorrows, a thousand toils.
In the furnace, summer’s nine days cool as water,
In the tripod, winter’s three months warm as spring.

**To Cao, Provincial Graduate of Fangzhou**
I urge you: recognize purity, shun worldly men,
Why cling to karmic toil and suffering?
Do you not know the years hasten man’s aging?
One spring passes—no spring returns.

II. Burdened by family, deluded by cares,
Too hasty in pursuit, too hasty in toil.
Dying in bitterness, not knowing bitterness is bitter,
Spring gone—how can spring return?

III. Alone bearing the family, providing for all,
No one to share suffering, share toil.
Wearying the heart with illusions, aging in vain,
Awakened, I grasp the true and hold spring.

IV. Awakened, shedding the vulgar—not a fool,
Spared the toil of labored life.
Life transforms the Five Phases, transcends creation,
Nature connects the Nine Turns—spring arises naturally.

V. Truly a man of single-minded cultivation,
When has he known sorrow, known toil?
The primal elixir congeals the mysterious treasure,
A grain of millet hides the pearl beyond the world’s spring.

**To Old Man Sha of Ninghai**
Delighting in his walled garden, a man of refined taste,
When has he known sorrow, known toil?
Able to gather the White Tiger’s flawless elixir,
Skilled to guide the Green Dragon—grotto’s spring abides.

**To Master Zhou of Wenshan**
A man in straw cloak and staff, carefree and idle,
Heart opened wide, loath to speak of toil.
Who would believe the grotto-heaven’s paradise,
Where no flowers bloom, no willows sway—yet spring abides.

**Again**
Wealth, lust, wine, and beauty most harm men,
The fiery household seethes with bitter pain.
Often they fret not for autumn’s coming scene,
Blindly clinging to spring before their eyes.

**To Li Maochun of Chang’an**
□ days hasten, aging man,
□ suddenly feels suffering, startled by toil.
□ discerns awakening, turns to the Dao,
□ thus, Chang’an’s Li Maochun.

*(Breaking the character "日" to form the verse.)*

**Again (composing from three characters)**
□□ often calls you a good man,
□□ fears hardship, dreads toil.
□□ knows all stems from filial piety,
□□ all transmit Li Maochun’s name.

**Regulated Verse in Seven Characters**
**[In Gratitude to My Master]**
Master Chongyang, the Wondrous Practitioner of Compassionate Transformation, drew me from the household—thus I compose this poem to thank my master’s mercy.

The mountain rustic mused on past freedom,
Amid the fiery household, worry and sorrow.
Seeking wealth and rank through myriad hardships,
Entangling endless grievances in toil.
Pondering life and death—how to escape?
Serving wife and children—when will it end?
Just as I sought to return, what fortune!
The Immortal of the Wind hooked me out to roam the clouds.

**Again**
The mountain rustic escaped the fiery pit’s woe,
Entering the Dao, no longer harmed by sorrow.
Day by day, carefree in song and chant,
Hour by hour, at ease in joyful praise.
Verdant mist and purple haze ever his companions,
Bright moon and clear wind his eternal peers.
Guiding kind souls to the Great Dao,
Cultivating merit to perfection, he ascends to Penglai.

**At Jiande**
Daoists have no kin yet none are not kin,
Grieving for all things, grieving for oneself.
Heart arises in compassion, enacting great virtue,
Mind devoid of attachment, revealing spirit.
Worldly realms are constantly swept aside,
The flawless garden renews itself daily.
Silently accumulating merit, merit fulfilled,
He rides the clouds to pay homage to the true master.

**Self-Description**
Three topknots—yet not out of piety,
If asked the reason, how could it be told?
Promoting the master’s name, one should bear it on the crown,
Concealing the scholar’s □, the heart remains steadfast.
Who knows that in this world, the mountain rustic,
Yields not to the unicorn immortal of the celestial court?
Today I reveal it plainly to you:
When merit is complete, he will tread the clouds and mist.

**Again**
Myriad entanglements seen through, all return to emptiness,
From this, cultivation bears fruit early.
The horse of the mind struggles against deluded love,
The monkey of the heart easily falls into folly.
Qi and spirit settle, the golden elixir congeals,
Dragon and tiger clarify, the jade nature glows red.
I report to fellow practitioners: rely on wondrous use,
Together we refine and ascend to Penggong.

**Again**
Doting on a wife is no wise man,
Lusting after beauty is truly a fool.
Even slight attachment invites poisonous hands,
The merest thought ensnares one in demonic bonds.
Essence withers, marrow dries, the form grows gaunt,
Qi scatters, spirit wanes, ghosts drag one away.
I awoke, I startled—best to flee early,
Why wait until the funeral drum’s lament?

**Linked Pearls Ode**
My heart ails, my heart heals,
People judge right and wrong—who truly knows?
Searching the wondrous, searching the profound, searching to grasp the true,
No contention, no competition, no forced cultivation.
Ever pure, ever still, ever generating goodness,
Demanding the Dao, demanding practice, demanding salvation from peril.
Cherishing jade, cherishing benevolence, cherishing deliverance,
Rousing the heart, rousing the mind, rousing compassion.

**Regulated Verse**
**Composed at the Request of Attendant Secretary Wanyan**
Attendant Secretary Wanyan remarked: "I did not expect you, Master, would dwell in a thatched hut within walled confines, enduring such carefree simplicity." Thus, I composed this.

Within the Horse Family Alley, the Ma family’s home,
North residence, south garden—nothing to boast.
What glory and splendor are not mere livelihood?
This carefree ease is the finest way of life.
Body and mind depart the vulgar, refining the golden cavern,
Clouds and waters turn to the mysterious, planting jade sprouts.
Suddenly, the world before my eyes feels narrow,
Within the gourd, sun and moon congeal the numinous cinnabar.

**Ode to Autumn Scenery**
The year’s finest scene lies in late autumn,
The Dipper points west, fire’s course flows.
Vital qi gathers essence, revealing wondrous use,
Frost flies to meet the season, responding to true cultivation.
Chrysanthemums bloom, ever evoking Tao Qian’s spirit,
Leaves fall, utterly devoid of Song Yu’s sorrow.
Toward dawn, wind clear, stream bright beneath the moon,
Someone awakens and sets forth for Penglai.

**Presented to Liu Bohu of Gaoling, Awaiting the Palace Examination**
Beyond Pengcheng’s worldly bounds, I search meticulously,
At the moment of awakening, all affairs cease.
Sitting or lying, no hindrance to leading the white deer,
Dwelling or walking, unimpeded in guiding the green ox.
Ever pure, ever still—one must recognize this,
True practice, true merit—decisively complete the cycle.
When the ninefold elixir is perfected, depart for Pengdao,
To specially seek the ancestral master, Liu Haichan.

**Exhorting Disciples**
Cultivation must abandon lust and wealth,
Beware the cup’s temptation, lest calamity arise.
Quickly cast aside the self and others, lay them low,
Hastily strike open the dragon-tiger’s cave.
The elixir forms, snow-white pellets gleam in the golden tripod,
Nature congeals, frost-like spheres radiate on the jade terrace.
White clouds ever fly at the grotto’s mouth,
When merit is complete, ascend to Penglai.

**Again**
Contending for fame, competing for profit—endless toil,
Unnoticed, the visage ages, temples turn gray.
Greed for wife and children brings bodily suffering,
How would one know the Dao’s virtue ever grows?
I hope you swiftly secure spirit and qi,
Learn from me, diligently refining lead and mercury’s frost.
When merit and practice accumulate, true nature manifests,
Together we shall ascend to Pengzhuang.

**Composed Upon Bringing Li Dacheng into the Walled Abode**
In the northwest, by the pavilion stream, a walled abode,
Here one may well conceal this body.
Before my eyes, emerald bamboo—several gentlemen,
Facing green pines—two great men.
Flowing water, artificial hills—mere child’s play,
Clear wind, bright moon—do you comprehend?
If you can grasp my planting of nine,
I, within these walls, plant leeks and scallions—thus I dwell here.
There is a share of numinous light to ascend to the Jade Capital.

**Presented to Zhang Zhengfu of Danxia Abbey in Qiyang**
Daoists have no kin yet none are not kin,
Grieving for all things, grieving for oneself.
Heart arises in compassion, enacting great virtue,
Mind devoid of attachment, revealing spirit.
Worldly realms are constantly swept aside,
The flawless garden renews itself daily.
Silently accumulating merit, merit fulfilled,
He rides the clouds to pay homage to the true master.

Parting clouds to summon cranes, I visit Twin Groves,
Cradling a wuwei thunder-zither in my arms.
Before Flower Calyx Tower, I meet a beneficent friend,
By Kunming Pool’s shore, I encounter a true confidant.
The Three Fields’ treasures illumine the spirit’s chamber,
The meridian’s infant emerges in brocade quilts.
In my palm rests a single night-shining pearl—
No need for foot’s labor to tread jade peaks.

**Presented to Li Dacheng, with respects to Abbot Jinggong**

Within encircling walls, most serene,
The Dao’s abode—pure emptiness—claims two rafters.
Deeply I cherish the bamboo’s gentlemanly resolve,
How I admire the pine’s aged, virtuous wisdom.
Eight channels’ limpid waters distill as clear wine,
Five Peaks’ linked summits rise like verdant lotuses.
Though Confucian scholars serve as beneficent friends,
Without the Three Teachings united, no harmony is complete.

**Presented to Master Zhang of Jingyang**

At sixty-four, the hexagrams near their close,
Suddenly awakened, heart reduced to ashes, I wander beyond the mundane.
Seeking me, you submit to true awakening,
Delving into mysteries, probing subtleties, you cultivate with devotion.
Your topknot parted like cloud-and-aurora companions,
Your hands raised like wind-and-moon comrades.
Bowing, you further clarify the precious principle—
Naturally, you shall depart to attend Penglai’s isles.

**Matching Rhymes for the Old Man of the Moon**

Having known the non-dual Dao precedes heaven,
Your tally matches the mountain rustic’s most wondrous words.
Simurgh and phoenix soar to nest in jade caverns,
Tiger and dragon roar to enter golden gates.
Within the gourd, heaven and earth’s marrow is refined,
Within the grotto, the roots of heaven and earth are shaken.
A single millet-pearl cradles sun and moon—
Dim yet luminous, neither dark nor dull.

**Matching Rhymes for Gao Neifeng**

Though you speak of officialdom’s dusty clamor,
Why must you rush through this life in haste?
Swiftly sever the ten thousand entanglements like snapped stalks,
Lest your singular nature drift like floating duckweed.
Emerging from the sea of suffering, the heart awakens,
Dispersing floating clouds, the moon shines clear.
When merit and practice reach perfection, you transcend the upper realms—
Only then do you know Ma Yu’s initiation of cinnabar sincerity.

**Matching Rhymes for Ning Bogong’s Poem on Gifting Silver Dates**

Seven-jeweled, exquisitely wrought, treasures of the hidden realm,
Bearing rare fruits and extraordinary greens.
Externally, powdered husks wholly encase jade,
Internally, water-crystal forms half-veiled in frost.
Refined with civil and martial fires to enhance their savor,
Boiled in pagoda-tree broth to deepen their fragrance.
I imagine you first tasted this delight—
Upon receiving your gift, this mountain rustic welcomes the true yang.

**Visiting Abbot Zhang Detong of Xiulin for the Palace Examination**

Beneath Gui Peak lies Xiulin Village,
Where a monk of refined tastes delights in the Daoist.
Parting clouds to summon cranes, I come to seek instruction,
Probing mysteries, inquiring subtleties, I shed worldly dust.
Wuwei purity—dragon coils, tiger crouches,
The great Dao’s spontaneity—phoenix births unicorns.
If Confucian Zhang and the suffering son awaken,
The Three Teachings shall converse of everlasting spring.

**Wu Zhengxin, Zhao Shuangxin, and Wei Lin Follow Me to Visit Gui Peak**

Three gentlemen accompany me on a journey with the Nine Immortals,
Twelve celestial cycles, twelve revolutions.
Relying on nine-three for wondrous efficacy,
Capable of transmuting two-six into elegance.
Nurture water and fire well within the furnace,
Then gather heaven and earth within the cauldron.
One day, when the elixir’s work is complete and radiant,
Together we shall tread the clouds to visit Penglai.

**Sent to Lu Dening of Pucheng**

Cease saying one cultivates while in the world,
Cease claiming the household is not a fiery pit.
Facing circumstances, the heart deluded, qi is hard to nurture,
Encountering demons, the mind scattered, essence is hard to gather.
I wish you would awaken to expel the Three Poisons,
Learn from me to settle and purify, banishing the Seven Emotions.
Sweeping your sleeves, transcend the sea of suffering—
Cloud companions and rosy friends discourse on longevity.

**To Lord Liu of Yaozhou, Who Dreamed of the Sea Toad and Sought Daoist Cultivation**

The Sea Toad entered your dream, transforming you into an immortal,
Dispatched to seek me and study wondrous mysteries.
Having words, how can one know wordless teaching?
Without speech, how can one awaken to spoken transmission?
Able to uphold the principle of wuwei purity,
You shall penetrate the subtle and grasp the workings of creation.
Heaven and earth wholly return to the golden-jade crucible,
The divine elixir coalesces, the true nature becomes whole.

**Again**

Why remain in Pengcheng, lost in confusion?
Fortunate to encounter and submit to the gate of purity.
Recognize the *Yinfu Jing*’s three hundred characters,
Diligently search the *Daode Jing*’s five thousand words.
Within, attain the one that unites the three wonders,
Therein, unite the three to attain the one’s splendor.
Let not black clouds become obstructions—
Naturally, you shall return to youth and revert to the origin.

**Matching Rhymes for Wang Zhiguan of Sanshui County**

As the years draw near the downward slope,
Awaken to the truth that your noble family is originally immortal.
Early, seek forests and springs, relinquishing worldly burdens,
Swiftly depart from temples and abodes, forsaking dusty ties.
On the plane of wuwei, penetrate the profound,
Within the heart of purity, reach the wondrous mystery.
When merit and practice are complete, depart for Penglai’s isles,
To attend incense offerings before Zhongli and Lü in Taiyuan.

**Matching Rhymes for Commissioner Zhou Sigong**

Beyond things, carefree, you follow nature,
At Zhongnan’s foothills, you foster good affinities.
How could you know my attainment of the "nothing from nothing" delight,
Exhorting others to depart from every kind of boundary?
Vast and unobstructed, you observe the gourd’s inner scenes,
Lush and verdant, you repair the grotto’s heavens.
When merit is complete and practice fulfilled, you ride the clouds away—
Together, you shall pay homage to Chongyang, the wind-harmed immortal.

**Matching Rhymes for Sun Gongzhidian of Ninghai Commandery**

I wish you would awaken to relinquish the ten thousand entanglements,
Beware lest worldly dust linger upon your nature.
In cultivation, there is turning and harmonizing of water and fire,
In the individual, there is no untimely demise, no passing of seasons.
Swiftly command the red horse to swallow the yellow horse,
Then make the green ox bellow at the white ox.
Refining the great elixir, its cinnabar walls radiant—
Why fear the Purple Palace’s summons will not arrive?

**Passing Through Xiushan Village to Seek Alms**

Within the Ma family’s lane, the Ma wind rages,
Yet encountering immortal cultivation, all things are forgotten.
Nurturing qi, preserving spirit, the Dao’s fruit is perfected,
Refining lead, smelting mercury, the cinnabar yang coalesces.
Pure and limpid, golden light gleams,
Serene and clear, the jade nature fragrant.
A heart like frost, devoid of self—
People come to draw fire, yet it grows ever cooler.

**At Qiyu Hermitage**

Reflection reveals cultivation’s utmost urgency,
Hastening to cultivate, still fearing delay.
Kan’s tiger and Li’s dragon constantly entice,
The heart’s monkey and mind’s horse cease their galloping.
Behind Purple Gold Mountain, the Three Essentials unite,
Before the White Jade Terrace, the Nine Pools are planted.
The three-fold heart’s zither forms its melody—
Clear and resonant, its tones harmonize with the immortal flute.

**Requested by Zhou Bingfu of Fushan County**

By chance, official documents brought me to your village,
Where I repeatedly enjoyed your company, Master Zhou.
You request my pure verses, and I cannot refuse—
I urge you to awaken and reflect on greed for wealth.
With a settled heart, the White Tiger penetrates the cinnabar cave,
With a tranquil mind, the Green Dragon ascends the treasure terrace.
Dragon and tiger entwine to form the great medicine—
The fetal immortal dances and sings, visiting Penglai.

**For Magistrate Liu of Fushan County**

Magistrate Liu, in your pursuit of the Dao, heed my words—
To enter the wondrous gate, your resolve must be steadfast.
Purity and stillness alone craft the immortal’s livelihood;
Fame and profit are no bonds of the Way’s affinity.
Let dragon and tiger gently harmonize their tuning,
Let neither monkey nor horse run wild in reckless play.
When spirit and qi merge in harmony, the great medicine forms,
And the numinous soul soars to the Great Canopy of Heaven.

**For Elder Shan of Fushan County**

Elder Shan, refined in nature and gentle in temper,
Cease your former pursuits beyond the proper path.
When monkey and horse lead the heart astray in false union,
Dragon and tiger enter the belly—true cultivation begins.
Within clarity, the jade maiden sings without pause,
Within purity, the golden infant dances without rest.
Guard the root-source firmly, and the elixir will crystallize—
When merit is complete and conduct perfected, you’ll journey to Yingzhou.

**For Ma Congshi of Huang County**

A man should ever wear a smile,
Facing moon and wind, freely raising his cup.
Lay down idle vexations, idle sorrows, idle burdens—
Be at ease, be joyful, be free from calamity.
Through non-action and purity, ascend the immortal’s path,
Through unobstructed freedom, mount the treasure terrace.
If you awaken to this as your true livelihood,
Together we’ll tread the cloud-steps to Penglai.

**Ritual Blessing for Ma Congshi’s Residence**

Awakened, you delight in the Dao, laughing without restraint—
For the ritual feast, seek but a cup of wine.
Fortunate to meet a Daoist priest performing the rites,
Assist in the pure offering to avert misfortune.
With blessings, purify your dwelling and abide in simplicity,
Summon the departed souls to ascend the Jade Terrace.
Auspicious qi and propitious clouds guide them forth,
To feast and wander amidst the peaches of Penglai.

**Matching Rhymes with Yang Dianshi of Laiyang**

Longevity’s phoenix calendar needs no divination—
The benevolent have ever outlived the brows of age.
Village elders all praise his virtuous deeds,
While Daoists marvel at his wondrous heart.
Yet why does his nature cling to worldly entanglements?
How may he fathom the mysteries within the profound?
I only wish this worthy family awakens soon,
To return together to Penglai’s isles and bow to the true master.

**Again**

When you meet me, you must recognize the constant truth—
The moon of your nature, luminous and round, yet square in principle.
Delight in the thatched hut, forsaking the towering hall,
Rejoice in the fence’s shelter, abandoning high walls.
Diligently cultivate the Three Clarities at the head’s origin,
Far surpassing the fame of the four examination halls.
You are destined to become an immortal in time—
Why seek remedies for blindness in governance?

□Virtue’s purity and leisure unite with the ultimate work.
□I urge Master Yu and fellow Daoists,
□To early, early exit the dusty cage. *(Begins with disassembled "龙")*

**Self-Exhortation**

**Wandering Traces Like Water and Clouds**

Wandering traces like water and clouds, drifting freely,
Jewel trees and jade flowers sway in the breeze.
Diligently refining the self within the Golden and Jade Cavern,
I conceal myself, lodging in a humble brick kiln.
Heaven’s gate and earth’s axis coil beneath my feet,
Auspicious qi and radiant light entwine my waist.
Do not marvel at the world’s coarse wine and yeast—
Rejoice instead in the stillness, drinking jade nectar.

Following the master’s guidance, holding fast to the Three Essentials,
I lure the divine youth to dance the *Liuyao*.
Only when the Wind Immortal descends to this realm
Shall I be ferried to Penglai Isle, forever carefree.

**On Seeing the Mirage at Sea on the Laba Festival, Matching Su Dongpo’s Rhyme**

The fisherfolk’s livelihood knows no emptiness,
Ever adrift amid towering waves.
Daily they cast nets, summoning hell’s gates,
Hourly they row, turning their backs on the immortal palace.
How did they come to repent their hearts?
Meeting me, their carving surpasses fine craftsmanship.
Overjoyed, they burn their boats and nets—
Compassion moves gods and dragons.
The mirage appears in the void, startling all eyes,
Within it, a white-bearded elder collapses in awe.
On the eighth day of the twelfth month, wonders arise,
Rare marvels of creation manifest in grandeur.
Coiling dragons and tigers chant endlessly,
Immortals emerge and vanish in boundless scenes.
Jewel palaces and pearl towers sway upon the waves,
Jade groves and jasper trees float in ethereal light.
Golden lads ride cranes, striking jade chimes,
Jade maidens ascend the altar, striking golden bells.
Auspicious omens layer the vast sky,
Felicitous clouds herald a bountiful year.
Awakened, the red phoenix’s wings tune gold,
Reversed, the green ox’s tail grasps bronze.
Reencountering the Chongyang Immortal’s teachings,
Ice-pure and jade-luminous, I delight in the true wind.

---

**Matching the Rhyme of Magistrate Wu Yanwu of Ninghai Prefecture**

On the eighth day of the twelfth month, the sea’s mirage fills the wintry sky,
Vast and formless, its wonders dwell in the unseen.
Purple mists transform into Penglai’s cavern,
Crimson clouds shape into the Palace of the Precious Vase.
Pearls of Sui gleam upon the sea, rivaling linked clams,
Broades of Shu trail the boat—where is the craftsman’s skill?
Windswept vistas chase mountain tigers,
Clouds stretch askew, birthing water dragons.
From afar, crane-riding youths with flowing locks,
In the distance, a straw-cloaked elder leans on his staff.
Jade maidens riding phoenixes—stranger still,
Golden lions pouncing on elephants—mightier yet.
Even Su Shi’s verses could not exhaust its praise,
Let alone the brush of a master painter.
I urge all to turn their gaze toward noble pursuits,
While I refine the true and harmonize qi.
Having grasped the principle of non-arising,
I save lives, slipping past the world’s bell.
Ever compassionate, I aid the drowning masses,
Yet harbor no worldly desires for family prosperity.
Diligently advancing the Dao, I cast off all trivial cares,
Inspecting my provisions—no copper remains.
Mastering the art of inversion and reversal,
I sing wildly, dance madly, feigning the wind.

---

**Matching the Rhyme Again**

Boundless lapis lazuli spans the half-sky,
Yin and yang’s creation unfolds within.
The Magpie Bridge ferries travelers from Three Mountains,
Phoenix carriages visit the Nine Heavens’ palace.
Marvelous towers rise, built by star-plucking hands,
Exquisite pagodas appear, crafted with unearthly skill.
Rank upon rank, Kan men ride white tigers,
Group upon group, Li women mount green dragons.
Young lads tie their hair in twin knots,
Old elders don hats with triple brims.
Suddenly, they soar like cranes in flight,
At times, they play like giant turtles in the waves.
Inwardly, they share the mountain recluse’s wealth,
Mocking the hollow riches of Shi Chong.
Nature abides, life halts—clear and manifest,
Spirit bright, qi refreshed—luminous and harmonious.
Compassionate words, like fine medicine,
Resound like the ringing of a bell.
Having quelled the demons of the heart and the chaos of intent,
I pray for the nation’s prosperity and the people’s abundance.
Vowing to renounce greed and embrace noble aims,
Swearing never to hoard foul copper.
Let none laugh at the mad chanting of the three-topknots—
The wind’s harm is but the wind’s own doing.

---

**Reusing the Previous Rhyme**

The sea’s mirage shimmers in the twelfth month’s sky,
Following Dongpo’s rhyme from the tenth month.
Auspicious qi forms Penglai’s cavern,
Rainbow clouds bear forth the Nine Heavens’ palace.
I come to the western heights to teach transformation,
Auspicious signs arise in the northern sea, revealing immortal craft.
Leaping ridges, racing mountains, I seek the tiger’s den,
Spouting clouds, spewing mist, I play with the pearl dragon.
For three full days, wonders unfold,
Astonishing an old man with rare marvels.
The fisherman’s joy at burning his nets
Moves Heaven’s Elder to transform the scene.
Poets compose verses, yet words have limits,
Painters strive to depict it, but brushes fail.
White-haired elders and yellow-robed youths rejoice,
Azure skies and crimson suns shine brilliantly.
The Four Hoary Ones frolic in wild dance,
The Eight Immortals feast, overturning their goblets.
Outwardly, virtuous deeds earn divine protection,
Inwardly, refining harmony enriches the Dao’s qi.
Holding precepts, I no longer transgress,
Seeing copper, how dare I grasp it?
I exhort later Dao seekers
To diligently and reverently follow my path.

**[For Daoist Companions]**

**[Composed in the Fourth Month of the Guimao Year While Traveling for Alms, Passing Through Fushan]**
*Using Su Dongpo’s "Sea Market" Rhyme to Express My Feelings, Presented to Fellow Daoists*

A horse wind meets the governance of empty space,
Water nurtures numinous mist in the midst of the indistinct.
Turning the wheel, I stir the treasury of exquisite jewels,
Cleaving open the radiant Palace of the Jeweled Stamen.
By nature fond of tranquility, the Dao, and virtue,
I teach farmers, scholars, merchants, and artisans alike.
Harmonizing the cauldron’s interior, dragon coils with tiger,
Luring forth the furnace’s depths, tiger entwines with dragon.
Lead essence and mercury marrow return to the root,
The Crimson Woman and Infant Boy cherish their Master.
Having awakened to the true livelihood of non-action,
How could I feign heroism through contrived deeds?
Devoted to delving into the Mystery, I escape suffering,
Reverently seeking the hidden, I fear no poverty.
My heart dwells in a humble hut, emulating Yuan Xian,
My belly nurtures the Embryonic Immortal, rivaling Kong Rong.
I revere the Teaching Master, Lü of Tang’s talent,
I follow the Preceptor, Zhong, Han’s general.
Ever sighing that a single gourd burdens me,
Never envying the five-brocade prosperity of others.
For nine years, I refined amidst the snows of Three Gullies,
For a decade, I never grasped a single copper coin.
Who will succeed Master Chongyang’s footsteps?
Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma propagate the family’s wind.

**[For Daoist Companions]**

While traveling for alms in Zhiyang, I was specially visited by the Daoist assembly of Penglai. At parting, they requested a poem, so I borrowed Su Dongpo’s rhyme, composing a hidden-head acrostic for them.

**[For Daoist Companions]**

In Huangyi, a Yellow Register Retreat was held, and I was invited to serve as the Ordination Master. Upon arrival, I performed empowerment at the Quanzhen Hermitage. Borrowing Su Dongpo’s "Sea Market" rhyme, I offered this to the Daoist assembly.

□ Decades spent, I relinquish urging wine goblets.
□ Wherever I wander, I propagate the teachings,
□ Coming to exhort the world, abandoning wealth’s abundance.
□ Mixing yellow paste is not the Dao,

□ Flowing like water, if you grasp Shan Tong’s principle,
□ Silk and cloth like mud, just like the wind.

Gao Jucai of Liaoyang,
Once walked hand in hand by the Eastern Sea.
On the same day, he met the Wind Immortal,

I know not who you are.
Better far to be pure and still,

In death, karmic sins abound.

Abandon the false, seek the mysterious,
Cultivate truth to ascend the Great Network.

Search for wondrous principles in the mysterious,
Gaze upon the stars within the grotto.

Ever vexed by the body’s shadow’s excess.
Weary of opening the eyes of fame and gain,
I envy not the sweetness of licorice.

Delighted by the many fresh breezes.
The Dao is but hempen cloth,
A fisher’s kerchief serves as wine strainer.

And immortality’s cultivation gradually increase.
In time, they shall ascend to the Jade Emperor’s court,
And avoid meeting King Yama.

*Five-Character Long Poems*

**Vigilance from Beginning to End**

Eleven years since entering the Dao,
Ever searching for faults within.
Should I wish to become an immortal,
How dare I dim the mirror of the heart?
Should I wish to become an immortal,
How dare I tread the crooked path?
Should I wish to become an immortal,
How dare I lose myself in the dusty world?
Should I wish to become an immortal,
How dare I accept reverence and honor?
Should I wish to become an immortal,
How dare I forget my nature and life?
Should I wish to become an immortal,
How dare I neglect merit and conduct?
With merit and conduct unblemished,
Immortals shall come of their own accord.

**[To Li Dacheng]**

While traveling through the northwest, I arrived at Huating,
Where I converted Li Dacheng.
Thus, I borrow Qiao Junzhang’s rhymes to present this,
Also to instruct the Daoist assembly.

□ Heed the Phoenix Immortal’s teachings,
□ Where do you often stray?
□ You wander the earth’s lungs,
□ Far to Peng Isle’s abode.
□ Riding principle, the hundred bones,
□ Radiance gleams in four directions.
□ Shunning wife and foe,
□ Weary of profit and fame’s coils.
□ The silk thread ever your companion,
□ How can worldly affairs bind you?
□ You aid the Dao,
□ First converting the Confucians.
□ Now seeking cloud companions,
□ Seeking crane-like disciples.
□ The hare flies, the crow soars,
□ The seventh stem rises at Geng’s call.
□ Ren sprouts spring willows,
□ You illumine the frozen lake.
□ The numinous dragon-tiger’s den,
□ The pulse of the mystic maiden’s joy.
□ Though the Daoist adept is skilled,
□ How can the nature be fully grasped?
□ Pointing to the mid-autumn moon,
□ Behold the true form’s chart.

*Composed by dismantling characters, borrowing ancient rhymes.*

Exhort the Fellow Daoists,

Though I have not yet attained,
I ever favor stillness and purity.
Glory and splendor do not stain me,
I envy not those who bear banners and flags.
With trusty brush I write poems and hymns,
My spirit ever resolute and keen.
Profound, I enter the realm of vagueness,
Limpid, I birth the depths of mystery.
My heart is like dead ashes,
My form akin to withered wood.
The Five Phases transmit to the Five Viscera,
Black and white, red, yellow, and green.
Refining in the true crucible,
Treasure coalesces in the radiant divine capital.
He who bears jade is hard to fathom,
I scorn both duke and minister.
The Great Dao is not hard to learn,
Only fear there be no sincerity.
Diligent practice must not be abandoned,
Embrace and guard it, never lightly.
Comprehend the profound and ever-profound,
All wonders enter your gate.
Not only do dragon and tiger submit,
Even ghosts and spirits stand in awe.
Like-minded friends visit daily,
The purple door remains forever unlatched.
Spiritual mushrooms ever fill my belly,
How can they compare to rank flesh and fish?
How did I come by this attainment?
By firming qi, spirit, and essence.
I await the path to Peng Isle,
Where simurghs and cranes come to welcome me.
Jade maidens play celestial music,
Utterly free of Zheng and Wei’s sounds.
The numinous terrace becomes a realm of stillness,
Clouds recede, the moon of nature shines bright.
Transcendent, I become feathered and transformed,
How can I be ranked with the myriad things?

I exhort those who study the Dao,
Do not seek outwardly.
A hundred years are but a dream,
Do not cling to profit and fame.
Let the incense of the heart ever rise,
Why must you recite the scriptures of immortals?
Simply maintain the practice of equality,
Purity and stillness will naturally manifest.
Would that others share my aspiration,
What worry then of not attaining longevity?

Matching the rhymes of Chaoxuzi Cao Tan of Fangzhou:

Great grief for the crimson leaves,
Great laughter for the shaven monk.
Great resolve to cast off life and death,
Great vow to save those sunk in illness.
Turning the body, I depart the sea of suffering,
Far from the vulgar, I escape toil and bustle.
With fate, I cultivate the numinous chamber,
Without affinity, I cross not the River of Nai.
In purity, the mystic maiden dances,
Within stillness, the infant sings.
Enticing the flourishing of divine elixir,
Guarding against the demons of monkey and horse.

Five-character regulated verse:
Self-Narration

The mind serene, dreams in sleep are few,
The will untainted, auspicious signs abound.
The numinous shimmers like crimson brocade,
The cinnabar smoke drifts like purple gauze.
Tiger and dragon grow wings,
Monkey and horse cease their bustle.
Infant and maiden attain true joy,
The womb-immortal responds in harmony with things.

Matching the rhymes of Huang County’s Hu Dianshi:

To the east stands an ancient monastery,
To the west, near the Daoist hermitage.
Southern mountains rise in emerald ridges,
Northern seas hold vast, deep pools.
Rosy clouds as companions, we inquire in the mysterious,
Misty friends, we delve into the wondrous.
If one can keep purity within and without,
Silently, the natural discourse flows.

Again:

A cloak woven from indigo-dyed straw,
Dwelling in a hut beyond the world’s dust.
The Dao enfolds the essence of heaven and earth,
Qi courses through the tiger-dragon pool.
Often do farmers and merchants arrive,
Yet none seek the Chan or Dao’s depths.
I wish you, sir, would cast aside your brush,
And early awaken to pure discourse.

To Magistrate Gao of Huxian, whose lofty aspirations sought me out:

The world’s net ensnares fame and gain,
Dust’s cage shrouds right and wrong.
Into the mountains I go to gather herbs,
Following the clouds, I return in pursuit of the Dao.
By a standing stone, I idly fish,
Gazing at others, I wish they’d soon grasp the subtle.
If one can hold far-reaching thoughts,
Surely they’ll fathom the profound and obscure.

To Yang Xuezheng of Jingzhao:

In choosing an art to establish oneself,
None surpasses the resolve to study books.
Yet studying books leads to passing exams—
How can one bear the emptiness of fame?
Better to seek the mysteries’ delight,
And perfect the great elixir’s furnace.
When the work is complete, transcend and depart,
Riding a crane to the immortals’ capital.

Matching the rhymes of Zhang Dujian of Qiyang Town:

Alas, the body is ever an object of contemplation,
Composed of earth, water, fire, and wind.
This borrowed union is hard to sustain,
True cultivation is easily refined and tempered.
Form and spirit together attain perfection,
The dragon and tiger naturally resound.
Their clarion echoes shake heaven and earth,
While the moon of the mind’s nature shines bright.

To Yao Xuanyu:

The heart ashen, wealth and rank forgotten,
The will at rest, delighting in pure poverty.
One may become a carefree wanderer,
And ought to be a self-possessed person.
Within qi, leisurely nurture qi,
Within spirit, further cultivate spirit.
Not clinging to the slightest falsity,
Only then can one attain the utmost truth.

Matching the rhymes of Zhao Gongchuo of Qiyang’s palace examination:

The great Dao is not hard to seek,
One should cultivate it with single-minded devotion.
Swiftly leave the fiery court,
No longer chase the flowing waves.
Do not be a fly or worm’s guest,
But rather a companion to swans and cranes.
Naturally, one will penetrate wondrous function,
And wander the clouds within one’s grasp.

To Master Duan of Guoxian:

Beyond things, abandon greed,
In purity, advance in cultivation.
Wood and metal stand threefold apart,
Heaven and earth flow in mutual exchange.
Bodhisattvas become close kin,
Immortals serve as companions.
A guest by the green lotus pond,
A traveler in the Yellow Crane Grotto.

*On Delusion and Awakening*

**To Yue Kongyue of Fengxiang Prefecture and Daoist Companions**

To raise a family is to endure hardship,
To study the Dao is to ascend as an immortal.
Raising a family seeks without,
Studying the Dao mends within.
Raising a family binds one to the wheel of rebirth,
Studying the Dao frees one from coming and going.
We are all the same in kind,
Only differing in awakening or delusion.

*On Sin and Blessing*

Exhortation to Fellow Daoists:
Raising a family breeds daily greed,
Studying the Dao fosters constant contentment.
Raising a family is for wife and child,
Studying the Dao detaches from worldly dust.
Raising a family forges sinful karma,
Studying the Dao reaps immortal blessing.
Sin and blessing each beckon their own,
Heaven’s halls stand opposite hell’s abyss.

*On Suffering and Joy*

**To Gao Mouke of Fengxiang Prefecture and Master Cheng**

Raising a family brings torment,
Daoist cultivation knows no searing brand.
Family drains the spirit,
Daoist refinement harmonizes the meridians.
Family burdens drag one to the Yellow Springs,
Daoist attainment lifts one beyond the azure vault.
Those who choose family or Dao,
Themselves invite suffering or joy.

*Enduring Chant*

**To Lin Tao Prefecture’s Magistrate Wu Gong of Wulin**

Family ties may seem worth clinging to,
Yet why bear the name of a fiery court?
If the Dao cannot be cultivated,
Even the sea toad seeks glory.
May one awaken to this soon,
And study the Dao for lasting ease.
Beyond things, delight in tranquility,
Refine and restore the original face.

*Leaving the Dust*

**To Li Qingchang of Yufeng and Fellow Senior Daoists**

The golden fetters shatter upon awakening,
The jade bonds break upon vigilance.
With skillful hands, untie the snare of fame,
With reverence, strike the lock of profit.
No longer will the ford of delusion ensnare,
Nor the waves of desire sweep me away.
Become one who leaves the dust,
And beyond things, cultivate the immortal fruit.

*On the Joy of Encounter*

**To Zhao Gongchuo of Qiyang’s Palace Examination and Fellow Daoists**

Do not let the horse gallop wildly,
Nor the monkey play unchecked.
The heart’s intent will naturally settle,
Self and others will effortlessly subside.

**Cultivating the True Within the Body**

Cultivate the true within the body,
Sever and restrain the false of form.
Eastward, I met Master Chongyang,
Westward, I attended Danyang’s horse.

*Roaming Free*

**To Magistrate Gao of Wugong in Lintao Prefecture, Who Sent an Envoy with a Letter Inviting Me to the Ancestral Hermitage on Zhongnan**

I vowed never to ride,
And the road is far—
I cannot hasten to attend.
This I compose in reply.

Encountering no fetters,
I penetrate the mysterious and nurture wisdom’s sprout.
Heart and spirit ever at ease,
Clouds and waters drift as they will.
Unburdened, I shoulder a flask of wine,
Leisurely, I loosen my sash.
Not only is the body at liberty,
But the nature, too, roams free.

*Walking the Dao*

**Exhorting Disciples**

Bright moon illumines the frosted forest,
A splendid carriage radiates its glow.
The jade crucible births sacred talismans,
The golden tripod brews nectar fine.
Rites know no constraint,
Serenity attains the extraordinary.
Why ponder household affairs?
Walking the Dao, all ties are forgotten.

*Three Marvels*

**Self-Admonition**

See through this corpse-shell,
And you must save the mortal frame.
Though five steeds bring glory,
They cannot herd the three marvels’ simplicity.
Wash away cares to extinguish the Three Peng,
Purify the heart to still the Three Horns.
All prize fame and high renown—
I alone marvel at the transcendent.

*Attaining Cultivation*

**Encouraging Disciples to Devote Themselves to the Dao**

Devote yourselves steadfastly to the Way.

**Discerning Lead and Mercury**

Discern lead to extinguish mercury,
Obtain mercury to revive lead.
Attaining Buddhahood gains the boundless,
Cultivating immortality holds profound mystery.
Immortal and Buddha converge in one pursuit,
Virtue and power achieve dual perfection.
With utmost care, settle the heart,
In practice, forget not steadfast resolve.

**True Unity**

*Presented to the Masters of Yingxiang Abbey, Fengxiang Prefecture*

Destiny purified attains longevity,
Nature stilled enables enduring vision.
Destiny is the name of qi,
Nature is the word of spirit.
Qi is the mother of spirit,
Spirit is the child of qi.
Mother and child form true unity,
True unity transcends life and death.

**Expressing Aspirations**

*Presented to Layman Li Dacheng of Lingyang, Huating, Dwelling in Simplicity*

Begging food but to fill the mouth,
Body lodged in purity’s abode.
The four concerns fail to attain truth,
One qi alone may serve as master.
Cultivate the moon of nature,
Know how to pluck the heart’s lute.
Extinguish corpse and worms entirely,
To spare oneself the bitterest of suffering.

**Daily Practice**

*Presented to Zhang Dawu of Huating, Bearer of the Lamp, and Fellow Masters*

At dawn, guard against the heart’s stirring,
At dusk, guard against the heart’s stirring.
Refining qi becomes one’s livelihood,
Nurturing spirit is daily practice.
Ever harmonize dragon and tiger,
Let not horse and ape play wanton.
Worthy is the sleeper awake,
Who escapes the dream within a dream.

**Strengthening the Root**

*Presented to Wang Daozheng of Youde Abbey, Longzhou*

See through the four false bodies,
Cultivate the one true form.
To become a numinous being,
One must strengthen the root.
Leisurely, without a single care,
Detached, free from the slightest dust.
Already a wanderer of freedom,
Also one of perfect ease.

**Non-Action**

*Self-Reflection*

I know not arts and methods,
I care not for seated meditation.
All day I delight in freedom,
All day I claim perfect ease.
Observing heaven’s great Dao,
Naturally attains harmony.
The master’s oral transmission:
Non-action yields the greatest merit.

**Purity**

*Presented to the Magistrate of Huating County, Mingwei*

Temper this stubborn heart,
Temper this worldly intent.
When the heart dies, passions do not arise,
When intent vanishes, essence remains secret.
Heart pure, qi naturally harmonizes,
Intent clear, spirit naturally rejoices.
One who abides in constant purity
Shall surely attain the immortal’s rank.

**Spontaneity**

*Presented to Magistrate Xiao of Longzhou*

Suddenly all concerns dissolve,
Suddenly the heart awakens.
The heart-ape naturally stills,
The intent-horse naturally halts.
Dragon and tiger naturally harmonize,
Spirit and qi naturally consolidate.
Golden elixir naturally coalesces,
Immortality naturally unfolds.

**Falling into Disrepute**

*Presented to Zhenyangzi, Lai Lingyu*

Body cast into disrepute,
Clothes hanging by two or three threads.
Freed from the enmity of wife and child,
Spared the bonds of profit and fame.
Sitting and lying without restraint,
Dwelling and moving without dependence.
Who knows this fallen man
Conceals feet treading clouds within?

**Sacred Merit**

*Presented to Li Zhenguo of Longzhou*

I possess the art of immortality,
Its revelation startles all who hear.
Within purity, gather heaven and earth,
In emptiness, set the tripod firm.
Upend Kunlun Mountain,
Uplift the vast ocean of the sun.
Mountain and sea transform to mulberry fields,
Nature and destiny endure forever.

**Perfection of Truth**

*After the Rhyme of Mountain-Dwelling Hall*

Perfection of truth—day, the golden crow flies,
Perfection of truth—moon, the jade hare returns.
Green dragon plays, leaping into tiger’s stream,
Is it so or not? Who can truly know?

**Eulogy**

*Eulogy of Non-Existence*

**On Not Awakening**

Not awakening to Non-Being, one strays into Being;
How then can one know that Being reverts to Non-Being?
All cling to things, yet things are not things—
I alone seem foolish, yet this folly is no folly.

**Hymn of Penetrating the Mysterious**

Having met the true, one cultivates the wondrous fruit,
A few within the mysterious attain clarity.
Pondering: life and destiny are not heaven’s decree,
The turning of yin and yang rests entirely with me.

**Hymn of Seeing Nature**

A single spark of numinous light illumines the great void,
No master of brush and ink could ever capture it.
Do not idly compare it to the bright moon—
How could its flawless cause resemble that which wanes?

**In Reply to Cao Shouzhi, Second Son of Cao Jieyuan of Fanzhou**

Surpassing Lord Pang and outshining Chen Qi,
Suddenly startled by life and death, yet joyfully emergent.
May the worthy Shouzhi hold fast to his resolve, never forgetting his beginning—
Surely his future will attain the One.

**Four Hymns Harmonizing with What Perfect Man Nifuhai Heard in the Void**

Mouth does not chant the sutra, yet the sutra chants itself;
Feet do not climb the tower, yet the tower ascends of its own.
Having awakened to the homeland, best to depart the homeland—
The field of the heart plowed, no more fields remain.

**Also**

Walking or sitting, all is simultaneous and the same,
The hand of great compassion employs means beyond hearing.
Rescuing stagnant souls and lonely spirits,
They emerge from hell and enter heaven’s gate.

**Also**

The great Dao is sought beyond the body yet within the self,
Amid fire blooms the blue lotus, dripping pearls of dew.
Ever present in the jeweled vase as an offering,
When the heart of compassion arises, it remains steadfast.

**Also**

No homeland, no village—
Yet homeland, yet village.
Rising compassion, rising sorrow,
Universally lifting, universally awakening.

**Presented to Zhang Siji of Huashi**

Unstained, unattached,
Non-action, non-creation.
Ever pure, ever tranquil,
True joy, true bliss.

**Presented to the Divine Youth Zhang Shouqing of Fengxiang Prefecture**

Great is the Dao, great is the Dao,
Unharmed, unbroken.
Those who awaken attain it—
Life and destiny endure forever.

**Presented to Official Miao Yi**

Shedding the dust, leaving the俗,
Penetrating the Three, awakening to the Six.
Cultivating qi, preserving spirit,
Forever securing immortal blessings.

**Presented to Master Xiao Ma of Longzhou**

Purify the heart, still the intent,
Cultivate qi, preserve spirit.
Merits manifest, conduct illustrious—
You shall become an immortal.

**Presented to Master Zhao the Dyer of Longzhou**

Shunning death, departing death,
Cherishing life, cultivating life.
Truly pure, truly still—
Nature abides, destiny endures.

**Instructions to Disciples**

Wine, sex, wealth, and temper,
Clinging, attachment, love, and thought.
Worry, sorrow, contemplation—
None of these are the Dao’s insight.

**Also**

Leisurely and carefree,
At ease and self-so.
Unstained, unattached—
Attain transcendence of the Three Realms.

**Also**

Heart pure, intent still,
Qi harmonized, spirit settled.
True breath, unbroken,
Numinous light, radiant.

**Also**

Non-action, non-creation,
Unstained, unattached.
Destiny transforms like frost and orb,
Nature connects to the elixir.

**Presented to Master Yu Neifeng**

The Dao-eye unclear,
The heart-ground unillumined.
Nothing else to do—
One’s practice of the Dao is not refined.

**Collected Verses on Resolving to Cultivate Immortality**

To cultivate immortality together,
All worldly ties are cast aside.
Never forget your original resolve—
With each step, strengthen your determination.
To the very end, hold fast,
And see it through to completion.
Life is like a pure breeze,
Nature like the bright moon.

*End of Volume Five of* **The Cave of Mystery: Gold and Jade Collection**
*Volume Six of* **The Cave of Mystery: Gold and Jade Collection**

**Six-Character Poems**

**On the Pavilion of Contented Aging**
I have a cup of fragrant wine,
To share with a kindred spirit.
Gazing upon the bustling world,
None compare to the carefree rustic elder.

**Also**
Fallen into dissipation, indulging in wine,
Drunk and sober—such states have been.
If one asks my lineage,
My ancestral home is in Fufeng, the elder of Shen.
My ancestor’s name was Jue, styled Shen-sou.

**Matching the Previous Rhyme in Tribute to Wei, Magistrate of Longzhou**
Fond of drinking the immortal’s wine of longevity,
Fond of seeking the "something" within "nothing."
Fond of revering the heart as one’s teacher,
Fond of becoming a transcendent elder beyond the mundane.

**Following Master Hu’s Rhyme**
□Zhang’s words are wondrous,
□All worldly chatter.
□Better to say nothing,
□In silence, the marvelous speech.

*(Lines begin with the character "口" [mouth], deconstructed.)*

**In Praise of Master Shi**
Master Shi encountered his fate,
Encountered Chongyang.
Chongyang transmitted the teaching,
Transmitted the Mystery and the Yellow.
The profound principle of Mystery and Yellow,
Never to be forgotten.
Within, he upheld cultivation,
Without, he severed worldly heat and cold.
Water and fire achieved harmony,
Sun and moon conjoined their light.
The dragon chants in the Li position,
The tiger roars in the Kan chamber.
Wood and metal stand apart,
Infant and maiden unite in round and square.
The elixir pellet is savored,
Its flavor known, its fragrance perceived.
The divine elixir coalesces in perfection,
Gleaming with crystalline radiance.
The immortal of the wind comes to ferry him,
Manifesting auspicious signs.
For three days they sang and danced,
Then bid farewell to the streets and lanes.
Only saying, "I depart,
Hastening to Peng’s estate."
Returning to the hermitage,
He suddenly passed away.
Onlookers gathered in crowds,
For the event was extraordinary.
His true nature, one and numinous,
Took its place in the ranks of immortals.

**Song**

**Song of Salvation** *(To the tune of Su Dongpo’s verse)*

I harbor no mind of going or staying—where then could it dwell?
Unshaken, unmoved, within the realm of the Three Yangs.
With single intent transcendent, seeking nothing without,
All affairs forgotten, ever turning inward in reflection.
A carefree soul unbound, a man of fallen fortunes,
I roam at ease, content in pristine poverty.
My body like a wild crane, untouched by snares,
My mind like a lone cloud, unstained by dust.
No merit, no dharma—my heart sits in meditation,
Idle chatter and baseless talk pass by my ears.
When people come beseeching me for rites of deliverance,
Again and again, I cannot turn them away.
Encircled by walls, I observe the summer retreat, applying blessings,
Daily prayers and a single meal—no lowly act.
Silently reciting the true scripture, I arouse compassion,
Rescuing the suffering with a shout, flinging open hell’s gates.
Lonely souls and stagnant spirits shed their shackles,
Singing wildly, dancing in chaotic joy.
By this merit they gain rebirth,
Auspicious clouds guide them to the Jade Pool feast.

I see worldly affairs as utterly hollow,
Yet I admonish mortals with stern exhortation:
"Seek wealth, seek wealth—but hold fast to righteousness,
For unrighteous wealth is sharp as a blade.
Better to see through worldly entanglements,
Boldly forsake wife and child, be a true man.
Never forget your original resolve, nor falter in retreat,
Day by day, month by month, follow my example.
Seeing yet seeing nothing, hearing yet hearing nothing,
Not seeing, not hearing—yet attaining true sight and sound.
The Dharma-body is formless, yet form manifests,
The Dharma-drum is soundless, yet sound resounds.
Exiting and entering doors, I am welcomed and sent off,
In welcoming and sending, the wondrous function is revealed.
Master Chongyang transmitted this to Shantong,
Now I pass it on to you all.
Naturally, rosy clouds stream from the chariot’s crossbar,
Naturally, one gazes toward the office of immortals.
At this point, east and west are no longer divided,
What worry is there of lacking a share in Fufeng’s lineage?
If one awakens to this profoundly profound principle,
Then Penglai and Yingzhou lie within a glance’s reach."

**Song of Compassion** *(Hidden-Head Acrostic)*
□ At last, fortunately meeting Chongyang’s immortal,
□ I forgot all, half-dragging my sleeves.
□ My cap askew, emulating my master’s way,
□ Like a sheep that eats not, no border outcast.
No border outcast,
□ The secret method transmitted at thirteen,
□ My heart of halberds long since dissolved,
□ Smoke extinguished, the three auspicious topknots gone.
□ Practicing great goodness, arousing compassion,
□ Mindful of the grieving, diligently exhorting the world.
□ The numinous remains unstained, forever pure,
□ Qi harmonized, ever so gently.
Ever so gently,
□ Planting in the cinnabar field, the immortal’s heels follow.
□ Silk and fine cloth resist wind and frost,
□ Bestowing on the poor, tattered though it be.
□ The brush never encroaches on profit or fame,
□ The tongue need not speak of dogs or swine.
□ A numinous object appears, spitting crimson radiance,
□ Revealing the teachings through poems and songs.
□ A crane arrives, sparse and distant, to summon me,
□ How could it refuse me, who vows so earnestly?
□ Thus I perform rites to deliver the departed,
□ Their resolve pitiable, their compassion worthy.
□ Silently praying to my original true master,
□ I report this to the underworld’s courts.
□ Below, lonely souls and stagnant spirits revive,
□ Above, they are ferried across like boats on water.
□ Their voices sing like birds of the nine marshes,
□ Where green simurghs and red phoenixes cry.

*(The acrostic begins with the character "人" [person].)*

**Song of Universal Salvation** *(Hidden-Head Acrostic)*
□ Colored waters flow between beams and pillars,
□ Where the crow and hare of sun and moon come.
□ Sincerely guarding the Dao, attaining true joy,
□ My intent ever pure, my wondrous words flow.
My wondrous words flow,
□ Profound discussions transmit the mystery to Zhong and Lü.
□ The secret method again passed to Wang, Feng, and the immortals,
□ Shantong, having met them, gained deep delight.
□ Gazing at the jade maiden singing in the cave,
□ Rejoicing as the golden infant dances in the void.
Dances in the void,
□ For years in Shaanxi’s right, dwelling in humble walls.
□ Months passed like monkeys halting, horses pausing,
□ Smoke extinguished, dragons entwining tigers.
□ Suddenly, a decree arrived in Shandong,
□ Virtuous people came to pray for inner blessings.
□ My cap straightened, I performed rites of deliverance,
□ Applying blessings to repay my homeland.
□ All souls and spirits rise from the Yellow Springs,
□ Wandering through clouds to return to the Purple Court.
Return to the Purple Court,
□ Where cloud-cranes do not reject me.
□ Ah! Universally saved from the wheel of rebirth,
□ All children ascend as immortals, none left behind.

**Song of Sighing**
Zhiyang’s Daoist friend visited Wendeng,
Not to seek blossoms or chase emerald splendor.
He spoke of Magistrate Zai sending a letter,
Inviting me to preside over rites to save the departed.
To save the departed—
A most noble task,
Yet some small matters must be clarified.
I fear later generations will imitate in vain,
Rushing to feasts and rites without cultivating the Dao.
Without cultivating the Dao,
How can one attain immortality?
To attain immortality, one must refine qi ceaselessly,
Reverse the waterwheel, let the lamp-tree fall,
Whirl through the cosmos, perfecting the numinous nature.
When the numinous nature is perfected,
One must accumulate merit,
Turning people’s heads to return to purity.
With compassion, rescue the drowning, build bridges,
With empathy, aid the perilous, erect ladders.
Erecting ladders,
Becoming a ferryboat,
Ferrying beings beyond, engaging in true cultivation.
Yet why do Daoist friends seek rites of deliverance,
Diligently praying for me to save the imprisoned dead?
To save the imprisoned dead—
What is this?
I am a man of non-action, of purity and stillness,
Never chasing rites or invoking the Heavenly Worthy,
Unskilled in ascending altars to perform rituals.
Performing rituals—
Summoning the yellow-crowned,
Purifying myself to ascend the altar, turning inward in contemplation.
Where I apply blessings, encircled by walls,
I silently pray to my original master, the Heavenly Immortal Official.
The Heavenly Joy Official—
Chongyang himself—
Sighing, he arouses compassion, transforming with pity.
A thousand layers of hell’s shackles open,
All departed spirits’ sins are forgiven.
Sins forgiven,
Together with lonely souls,
They roam the Purple Court, entering the gates of immortals.
In the Land of No Night, they attain true joy,
In the Cave of Eternal Spring, they hold golden cups.

**Matching Hu the Preceptor’s Rhyme**
The Perfected of Chongyang sought a friend,
Traveling east to Ninghai.
The lazy man with three topknots chose immortality,
Journeying west to Chang’an.
The great road of Chang’an—
What is it like?
Fit for the carefree,
Apt for abandoning the infant.
Having grasped the profound essence,
One should restore the body’s form.
Drawing and adding, employing and arranging,
Next in sequence, step by step.
Flying birds and running hares,
Both play in pristine whiteness.
Smoke vanishes, fire extinguishes,
Sharpness blunted, strength subdued.
Severing afflictions,
Washing away dust.
The heart unstained,
Teeth free from decay.
Gold flowers to be admired,
Jade trees to be cultivated.
Fire nurtures the grass of wisdom,
Water nourishes the sprouts of the numinous.
Ever let the numinous flame blaze,
Never let the spirit-water overflow.

Keep the life-lamp ever bright and clear,
Never let the nature-candle sink and fade.
Seek those of like heart and like virtue,
Discussing with support and sequence in turn.
The Three Corpses bow and submit within the square inch,
The Six Bandits struggle to reach the Nine Heavens.
To turn the sun and moon within the pot,
One must invert the mountains within the cave.
Attaining the natural, desires scatter like stars,
Attaining the natural, self and others dissolve like stars.
The great elixir, pure and numinous in the jade crucible,
The fetal immortal sings and dances on the Jasper Terrace.
How lamentable is the clamor of fame and profit,
How lamentable the sorrow of life and death.
Best to thoroughly examine worldly ties together,
Lest the walking skeleton briefly stray in madness.
Resolve to refine the form like withered wood,
Resolve to subdue the heart like cold ashes.
One day, when the ninefold elixir is complete,
Ride the clouds to Penglai together.

**Method of Establishing the Body**
The method of establishing the body is clearly revealed:
Firmly restrain the horse of intent,
Tightly lock the monkey of the heart.
Sever stinginess and greed,
Subdue self and others.
Be cautious in speech,
Guard against faults of the mouth.
Do not stir up waves,
Do not kindle smoke and fire.
Steal moments of leisure amid busyness,
Hide within the clamor.
Cultivate benevolence and accumulate virtue,
Dispel calamities and extinguish misfortunes.
Yield to others and advance the self—
This too bears the fruit of immortality.

**[On the Ten Perfections]**
The ten perfections are internal matters,
Not phenomena before the eyes.
Truly pure, truly still,
They are naturally attained:
A flowing rosy glow in the nape,
A radiant light in the eyes,
A surge of harmony in the ears,
A jade pillar in the nose,
Sweet nectar in the mouth,
True fire in the heart,
The Yellow River flowing backward below the navel,
Wood and metal turning with the waves,
Heaven and earth naturally conjoined,
The ten perfections complete—nature becomes effortlessly refined.

**Linked Verses**
Breaking free from the reins of fame, the guest of the Three Isles,
Wrenching open the lock of profit, the immortal of the Ten Continents.

The path to longevity demands repair,
The root of deathlessness must be tempered and refined.
Cultivate the heart as a guest of eternal life,
Refine the nature as one who lives yet is dead.
Refine the qi—qi harmonized, the spirit leaps;
Cultivate the true—true purity, the nature gleams.
Focus the heart to study the Dao, one must penetrate the Dao;
Steel the will to refine immortality, one is bound to meet immortals.
Who knows that divine brilliance surpasses talent’s glow?
I find the heart’s clarity outshines the eyes’ brightness.
When the heart is free from clinging, the spirit’s radiance shines;
When qi flows without stagnation, the nature’s wisdom is complete.

In water, flames burst forth—three elixirs coalesce;
Within fire, a lotus blooms—a single nature awakens.
The man who studies the Dao bears no self;
The hero who refines immortality harbors no human sentiment.
Forget the surface, awaken within the heart;
Within the Dao, penetrate the wondrous and the profound.
In dreams, the shadowless sword was once grasped;
Through the Dharma, the heart of attachment is cast away.
Amid dust, unstained—awakening in the heart;
On the Dao’s path, mystery is penetrated—nature becomes numinous.

Within yin, yang is concealed—yang blazes resplendent;
Within life, the nature is nurtured—the nature gleams.
To study the Dao, one must rely on a heart resolute and fierce;
To refine immortality, the will must be steadfast and unyielding.
The stone maiden plays the flute—phoenixes dance;
The clay ox enters the sea—tiger and dragon harmonize.
The jade maiden, delicate and radiant, strikes the dragon’s horn;
The golden infant, clear and unbound, rides the tiger’s waist.
Beneath the Jasper Pool, the green luan dances;
Within the Palace of Langyuan, the white crane soars.
In the sleeve, a green serpent—a three-foot sword;
Within the abdomen, a white tiger—the nine-times-returned elixir.

Within the Azure Radiance Palace, red snow is gathered;
Before the Jasper Cliff, the Red Pine is admired.
Heart pure, intent clear—the path to heaven’s hall;
Intent scattered, heart wild—the gate to hell’s abyss.
The pivot of transformation relies on the power of non-action;
Creation depends entirely on the work of purity and stillness.
With a single sleeve, sweep away the world of dust;
The three elixirs coalesce—one becomes a Great Luo immortal.
Seize the primal, numinous essence;
Behold the original truth of the primordial beginning.
Six by six, yin dissolves—the elixir glows resplendent;
Three by three, yang gathers—the nature shines with spirit.

The root of clouds, the bone of water—return to the golden crucible;
The marrow of mercury, the essence of lead—gather in the jade furnace.
Swiftly cast the self into the mountain’s embrace;
Hastily pierce open the cave of dragon and tiger.
Trample the tortoise and serpent—true living practice;
Harmonize dragon and tiger—a fine livelihood.
If you wish for the maiden and infant to play within the crucible,
You must cause the sun and moon to share the same palace.
Within the crucible, refined gold births five hues;
Within the furnace, fine jade coalesces into three lights.

The hare flees, the crow flies—plunging into the sea of qi;
Dragon’s roar, tiger’s howl—entering the capital of spirit.
Tightly bind the heart-monkey—no leakage in the elixir;
Firmly seize the intent-horse—the nature becomes clear.
Subdue the heavenly pass and earthly axis;
Pivot the Kan tiger and Li dragon.
When the monkey rages and the horse falters, the Dao is hard to achieve;
When the tiger withdraws and the dragon coils, the true is easily seen.

Fewer matters in the heart, fewer worries;
More dust on the nature, more afflictions.
Within having, having—yet not having, having;
Within non-having, non-having—yet having, non-having.

**[Returning to the Mountain Melody]**

Yu, together with the monk Master Zhulü and Palace Examination graduate Fan Shouqing, once burned incense and sat in quietude at the Three Teachings Hall north of the prefectural city. Master Wang arrived bearing a qin and played it. As the sun slanted westward, he performed the qin melody *Returning to the Mountain Melody*, for Yu harbored the intent to return to the True.

"To be capable of non-doing is to be capable of all-doing;
To be capable of non-knowing is to be capable of all-knowing.
Who would not pursue this Dao once they know it?
Yet who truly understands it when they pursue it?

The wind sighs, sighs—leaves take flight;
The wild geese cry, cry—southward they return.
Alas, the world of men—days and months hasten;
Age nears death, yet still they cling to folly.

Grieved, the human world—my soul would take wing;
Alas, the human world—my heart would shatter.
Hard to resolve—this world is not my home;
I point to the green mountains—best to return early.

By night, the green mountains—bright moon soars;
By dawn, the green mountains—bright moon returns.
Hunger fed by rosy clouds, thirst slaked by streams;
Cut off from the world—none know me.

No-knowing, no-doing—
This heart extinguished, what doubt remains?

Suddenly, twin blossoms fly in the celestial court;
Ascending the Three Palaces, I wander the Purple Tenuity."

**[In Praise of Shedding the Form]**
In the *guimao* year, the Master’s Father, Perfected One Danyang, one day took up his brush and wrote, calling it *In Praise of Shedding the Form*. That very year, he indeed shed his mortal coil, and so it is collected here.

"The light that guards the body shines with uncommon radiance;
The beast that guards the body—wind and clouds attend before and behind.
Great is the ascent to Perfection—shedding the form to attain longevity.

Azure locks, green brows,
Crimson cheeks, pale skin.
Like the dragon, he changes his bones;
Like the cicada, he sloughs his skin.
Not altering his nature—why leave behind an empty robe?

Still as if asleep, he lies upon the mat and departs.
Great is the ascent to Perfection—the path leads into the azure depths.

Unicorns follow the crimson regalia,
Phoenixes draw the vermilion carriage.
The simurgh’s cry, jade pendants tinkling,
Treading the void, stepping upon clouds.
Exalted, he receives the true decrees,
Ascending to the Jade Celestial Court.

How long the celestial path—
The immortals take flight.
Striking metal, tapping stone,
Scattering flowers, burning incense.
The sound stirs the Three Realms,
Multitudes gather from the ten directions.
All demons revere him,
The Six Dings are startled and flee.

The numinous embryo now complete,
Fortunate to be free of calamity and blight.
Yet gazing back at the pines and cypresses—
Not for the sake of distant years.
Mountains may crumble in time,
Seas may turn to fields.
Long earth, enduring heaven—
Forever ranked among the Immortals."

*The Sixth Scroll of the* Treasury of Daoist Gold and Jade *is complete.*
*The Seventh Scroll of the* Treasury of Daoist Gold and Jade.

**On Gratitude**

The grace of heaven and earth, sun and moon, father and mother,
Cannot lift me from the depths of sinking.
Brothers and sisters—brief acquaintances,
Wives and children—even less akin.
Fortune met the Wind Immortal, who transmitted secret formulas,
Enabling Ma Yu to attain good causes.
Severing passions, cutting attachments, harmonizing dragon and tiger,
Abandoning cares, forgetting schemes, birthing phoenix and qilin.
Within jade, gold is born; the elixir coalesces as treasure,
In water, fire is nurtured; qi settles the spirit.

The master’s grace runs deep—impossible to repay,
I vow to circle the walls in death, refining the utmost truth.

**Lyrics: Tenfold Gratitude (Originally "Auspicious Partridge")**

**First Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Beyond the world’s dust, a life rare to hear of:
Tempering the jade furnace with snow from three ravines,
Perfecting the golden tripod with clouds from a single stream.
Dragons ought to bathe in fire,
Fierce tigers may burn in water.
A single grain of divine elixir shines through jade,
Its numinous radiance peerless, transcending all.

**Second Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
I swear to cultivate, resolve to refine the heart:
Fire’s flames extinguished, fire nurtures wood,
Mercury exhausted, water gives birth to gold.
Wood and gold in three realms open the mysterious path,
Water and fire flow as one, forming a treasure peak.
With enduring vision, the great elixir is complete, never leaking,
Bearing clouds, I depart, free from rising and sinking.

**Third Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Refining the numinous embryo in the Jade Capital:
Lead and mercury simmer—first come signs,
Tiger and dragon mate—how could there be no sound?
Three luminaries shine together, surpassing the three meditations,
Five peaks merge as one, issuing from the five phases.
When the three-five elixir is complete, true creation is achieved,
Naturally stepping upon clouds to visit Penglai.

**Fourth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Heaven and earth gathered into the treasure vase,
Sun and moon, mountains and rivers enhance its splendor,
Tiger and dragon, infant and maiden find peace.
Light and clear, heavy and turbid—yin and yang aligned,
Vast and deep, lofty and bright—all things imbued with spirit.
The radiant red elixir completes nature and life,
Transcendent, riding a crane across the celestial court.

**Fifth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
I swear never to be tainted by wine, lust, anger, or wealth.
First, I drive away the solar crow,
Then firmly seize the lunar hare.
The moon’s wheel shines anew, without wax or wane,
The sun’s brilliance intensifies, without dimming or sinking.
When merit is full and the elixir complete, where shall I go?
Beyond the cloudy Han, free from yin and yang.

**Sixth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Unfettered, carefree, untouched by dust:
Seeing through the false body as truly false,
Probing the true nature as truly real.
Only then knowing the Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,
Only then realizing the unspiritual is the source of the spiritual.
With the pure elixir complete, I ride the red phoenix,
In the Great Luo Heaven, savoring eternal spring.

**Seventh Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Grasping emptiness, stilling the mercury of death:
Cattle and sheep fill the path, lying in my way,
A pavilion of wind and moon proves one’s purity.
Clear and pure, hard to be deceived by the false,
Pure and clear, easy to perceive the real.
When the dragon-tiger elixir is complete, no nine revolutions needed,
Naturally, eternally, I become an immortal.

**Eighth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Reversing yin and yang, relying on refinement and cooking:
Fire descends, water ascends, casting snow-like waves,
Dragon’s roar, tiger’s howl, unleashing thunderous sounds.
The jade furnace’s auspicious snow layers upon layers,
The golden tripod’s propitious light softly arises.
The priceless elixir complete, no aging or death,
On the path of long life, the dharma-body is light.

**Ninth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Mind pure, heart clear, the path smooth and level:
Using non-action as creation,
Not relying on effort for enterprise.
Just like luring dragon and tiger,
Or harmonizing maiden and infant.
With the elixir of living joy complete, I depart for Penglai Isle,
Where Master He and my teacher come from afar to welcome me.

**Tenth Vow to Repay the Master’s Grace**
Shattering the golden willow, the jade shackles of emotion:
In the Gate of Enduring Vision, cultivating endurance,
On the Path of Long Life, attaining longevity.
Dim and silent, limpid and deep,
Vast and obscure, pure and clear.
At dawn, the elixir complete, I depart for Penglai Isle,
Where Master Chongyang comes from afar to welcome me.

---

**Expressing Feelings #1**
No entanglements in the realm of profit and fame,
No flames of self and others in the crowd.
With intent, I wander mountains—upon their ridges,
With joy, I delight in waters—beside their clouds.
Coming and going, drifting like a solitary crane,
Staying or leaving, serene as a cicada.
How many can attain such carefree ease?
Let others say I live as a divine immortal.

**Begging in the Streets**
Spare a coin, good people, to aid the poor and forge karmic ties.
Silently, it returns a hundredfold,
Openly, it nurtures my three fields.
Abandoning stinginess opens the heart’s ground,
Severing attachment unlocks the wondrous mystery.
One day, awakened, I leave the sea of suffering,
Carefree beyond the world, cultivating immortality together.

**Exhorting Disciples**
The Daoist’s livelihood does not intrude,
Each seeks their own clothing and food.
Avoid idle words and quarrels,
Let go of worldly affairs and worldly cares.
Probe the profound, abandon thoughts—dragons follow tigers,
Seek the hidden, forget schemes—water nurtures gold.
Purify the colored body to preserve the dharma-body,
When the elixir in the furnace is ripe, step upon the jade peak.

**A Daoist Friend Asks If One Can Cultivate at Home**
To be an immortal yet cling to a wife is folly,
Stealing moments from busyness to seek the Dao.
The gate of purity remains unrecognized,
Lustful desires and deceptive arts seize the heart.
Seeking both family and Dao to be perfect—how?
How to savor the sweetness of solitude?
Do not wait for Fengdu’s summons to arrive,
Return early beyond the world to dwell in a cloudy hermitage.

**Presented to Marshal Li**
Make your body a cinnabar mound,
Within, ever wandering clouds and waters.
Li and Kan palaces exchange as true midnight and noon,
Jia and Geng positions shift, erasing spring and autumn.
The five phases and four images are all without use,
Yet the three isles and ten continents have their reasons.
With merit and conduct unblemished, clouds and cranes guide you,
In the Great Luo Heaven, ranked among the immortals.

**Meeting Daoist Friends During the Cold Food Festival**
Cold food forbids fire, restrains the mind-monkey,
True breath regulated, eternally continuous.
Not roaming clouds and waters along fragrant grass paths,
How could body and mind cling to the apricot blossom sky?
Do not become a tomb-bound ghost,
Learn from me to cultivate as an immortal beyond the world.
One day, the great elixir completes its nine revolutions,
Ascending the void—why need to swing on a swing?

**Presented to Zhang Shubiao of Jingyang**
At sixty-four, the hexagrams near their end,
Suddenly awakened, heart like cold ashes, leaving the worldly.
Seeking me to probe the true and return to right awakening,
Probing the profound, seeking the hidden, practicing cultivation.

**Presented to Master Duan**

Brow parted like forked chignons, companion of cloud and rosy dawn,
Hands revealed in clasped fists, comrade of wind and moon.
Bowing deeply to clarify the principle of cherishing,
Naturally one may depart to attend Penglai Isle.

**Presented to Master Jiang**
*Breaking the character "段" (Duan) to begin*

Beyond the world, Master □ enjoys a fine livelihood,
With □ fire meeting to congeal the great cinnabar.
□ maiden lingers to behold the great elixir,
□ ox roars in play with numinous blossoms.
□ clouds spread earthward, the alchemical furnace blazing,
□ child gazes heavenward, azure eyes radiant.
□ with three lifetimes, you awaken,
□ within, untroubled, you tread mist and rosy clouds.

**Presented to Master Jiang**

The Abbot of Changchun Hermitage in Ninghai, Master Jiang,
Along with fellow Daoist friends, pitying my difficulty in walking,
Constructed a handcart for me.
On the day the work was completed, he came to Fushan to deliver it,
So I composed these words in gratitude.

Blue ox, white deer, and yellow sheep,
Steadily pull the cloud chariot day and night.
Bearing the weight of heaven and earth, ever in union,
Pushing the sun and moon, their light eternally intertwined.
The Dharma wheel resounds, entering the dark cavern,
The cloud carriage jingles, entering the Daoist sanctuary.
If you awaken to the nine revolutions of the elixir,
Naturally you shall succeed Ma Danyang.

**Presented to the Daoist Assembly at the Huanglu Offering in Wendeng County**

On Kunyu’s three-chignon steeds, Ma and Feng sing,
Meeting those who cultivate immortality, weary of worldly affairs.
I dwell in non-action to fulfill my original vow,
While others seek memorial rites, tormented by suffering.
Through empowerment, I assist the offering within these humble walls,
Delivering departed souls to the Great Luo Heaven.
Fortunate are the lingering spirits and solitary souls,
All together transcended in boundless joy.

**Again**

Since first encountering the joy of pure poverty,
Delighted to dwell within these enclosing walls, fearing the dust of the world.
Refining qi, qi harmonizes, spirit clings to qi,
Nurturing spirit, spirit is refreshed, qi settles spirit.
Magistrate Zai invited me to perform memorial rites,
This humble one, with compassionate heart, upholds the good cause.
Delivering departed souls to ascend the upper realms,
All solitary spirits and lingering souls turn toward the True.

**Burning Heart Incense** *(originally titled "Xingxiangzi")*

Husband and wife parted—
Who are you? Who am I?

With their household—originally no kinship,
All through matchmakers’ words, we bound in marriage.
Then fell to folly’s cliff, craving wealth and property,
Only dreading poverty.
You too lost in dust, I too lost in dust.
Managing family ties—burning oneself in fire.
Drawn by their affection, enslaved in my heart and spirit.
Fortunate to meet Master Fengxian,
Parting ways, each cultivating the True.
Going forth to teach on the streets

Master Chongyang, truly a true teacher,
Instructed Ma Yu to live as a beggar.
His livelihood pure and still, his path non-action.
Stroking the heart’s zither, harmonizing dragon and tiger,
Drinking the elixir pellet.
Vowing never to return to Shandong,
For his destiny lay in Guanzhong.
Thus blending light, mingling with the world as time flows.
Idly wielding the bamboo skimmer,
Only wishing others to know.
Hoping not to return too late,
Lest time pass in vain—hasten your practice.

To all fellow disciples

Not yet reaching Danyang,
How dare I claim to be a teacher?
To those of like mind, I reveal a little.
The wondrous place of longevity
Seems to require some effort.
Gathering five-colored clouds,
The qi of the Five Phases, the tablets of the Five Directions.
A rooster born in the west, a rabbit born in the east—
Such is the time of wood and metal’s separation.
In purity, the meaning is grasped;
In clarity, the heart knows.
Wishing for early purity of heart,
Early clarity of intent,
Early practice.

Exhorting Brother Xiang to beg for leftovers

A tumbleweed beyond the world, starving within,
Suddenly hearing the temple bell strike—
Begging for leftovers, praying to the Mysterious Origin.
Remember, those who leave the household
Have no home, no land—Daoist poverty.
Hemp and wheat fill the meal,
Dispelling corpse-worms.
Awakening to an empty heart,
A full belly, harmony within.
The infant rides the tiger, the maiden mounts the dragon.
In the realm of emptiness,
Coming without trace, going without shadow.

**Again**

Sudden enlightenment, carefree—
The causes of leaving the world.
Hearing only of others
Building feast-halls,
One stretches out one’s arms,
Standing at the side—
Begging for leftover broth,
Seeking scraps of rice,
Passing the remnant years.
Shameless, unabashed,
Quenching fire, dispelling smoke.
Then turning the mind
To seek the wondrous, to seek the mysterious,
Unfolding the jade bud,
Gathering the golden lotus.
Feeling qi and spirit clear,
Spirit radiant—
Becoming an immortal.

**For Master Wang the Fifth, Presenting Food Within the Enclosure Wall**
Teach them to remove what should be removed,
Yet they vie to prepare feast-kitchens.
Brothers weary,
Wasting effort in vain.
Better to rest early,
To recognize the primordial origin—
There, seek the root of clouds,
Follow the feet of clouds,
Tread the cloud thoroughfare.
Breathing like a tortoise,
Seeming to exist, seeming not—
Feeling harmony and ease
In coming and going.
Turning mountains and peaks,
Inhaling rivers and lakes.
Giving birth to the immortal embryo,
Forming immortal substance,
Ascending to the immortal capital.

**Chanting Incense**
Not burning aloeswood,
Idly burning the incense of the heart.
Spreading the wind of benevolence,
Everywhere incense is heard.
Each person turns toward goodness,
Each cherishes incense.
Wishing to abide in non-action,
Ever pure and still—
Naturally fragrant.
Wondrous cavern-cloud incense,
Tiger’s roar sprays fragrance.
Moreover, the dragon’s chant
Exhales fragrant scent.
Jade forms the precious talisman,
Gold binds the cinnabar incense.
Attaining the journey to Penglai,
Transcending the Three Realms,
Offering true incense.

**Chanting the Crane**
Though dwelling among chickens,
Like a phoenix amassing down—
Ever since Ding Ling
Manifested thus.
Frost-white feathers, crimson crest,
Jade wings, jade-like flesh.
Feeding on duckweed in Taihu,
Nibbling chestnuts by the pool,
Crying to the clouds and rainbow.
At dawn, playing in the field of mushrooms,
At dusk, drinking from the Jasper Pond.
Awaiting Wang Qiao
To come and rein it in.
Dancing in the market of Wu,
Riding the strange chariot of Wei—
Then pointing toward Penglai,
Morning court in the golden palace,
Ascending to the cinnabar steps.

**Exhortation to the World**
Visage ashen,
Whiskers and temples streaked with gray.
Yet still foolishly deluded,
Envious, greedy, miserly.
Not worrying for oneself,
But caressing wife and children.
Crafty thoughts arise,
No mind to yield,
No heart to relax.
In the waves of the bitter sea,
Ever bound to the fire-house.
Deploying schemes,
Accumulating karma like mountains.
Not seeking the Great Dao,
Ever obstinate and dull.
Who among you knows—
Cultivating immortality is easy,
Nurturing a family is hard.

**Karmic Retribution of Good and Evil**
Those who do evil,
Violent and unmatched—
Carefully considering,
What can they do?
In life, facing official law,
In death, meeting King Yama.
As prisoners in hell,
Pounded in mortars,
Ground in mills.
Those who accumulate goodness,
Reverent, humble, harmonious—
Carefully considering,
They surpass all.
Black ledgers hard to collect,
How could they enter penal courts?
Moreover, divine spirits protect them,
Households prosper,
Descendants multiply.

**Inscribed for Master Wu at the Eastern Gallery**
Sixth month’s severe cold,
Twelfth month’s scorching heat—
This true work,
Clearly inverted.
Within yang, yin reaches its extreme;
Within yin, yang is born.
From the midst of the Five Phases,
Who has walked this path?
I walk the journey.
Myriad golden lotuses,
Ever flourishing in fire.
Within water, beholding
The red flames ascending.
The two gathered together,
One nature perfectly accomplished.
Then wearing the Three Flowers,
Combing the three topknots,
Bowing to the Three Pure Ones.

**For the Two Directors, Zhang and Liu**
I exhort Qinghe,
Urge Pengcheng—
And all gentlemen,
Cease wearying the spirit.
Swiftly leave the fire-house,
Early depart the sea of delusion.
Though roaming with water and clouds,
Return beyond things,
Becoming a person of leisure.
Truly cultivating the Dao,
Washing away the dust of the heart.
With cloud companions,
Rosy friends as kin,
Delving into enduring vision,
Discoursing on longevity.
Then awakening to the mysterious,
Penetrating the wondrous,
Attaining the true.

**Thanks to Elder Li of Xingping County and His Wife for Offering Their Son to Study the Dao**
This offering is no ordinary thing,
The cause of leaving the world.
Forsaking their beloved child,
Entering the Dao to seek the mysterious.
Each person praises their goodness,
Each calls them virtuous.
Then their name spreads far,
Far-spreading fame,
Beyond the land of Qin.
The deep kindness of parents—
To repay it, heed these words:
We must capture
The mind-monkey.
Qi flows through the eight vessels,
Merit fills the three fields.
Saving the Nine Mysterious Lords,
Seven generations of ancestors,
Together becoming immortals.

**For the Traveling Merchant, Master Fan**
The rustic of Three-Topknot Mountain,
Sighs for Master Fan—
Trading alum in the waves
Of the bitter sea.
To dispel afflictions,
Assist with a sail’s wind.
Then abandoning splendor,
Leaving the burning fire,
Exiting the mundane cage.
Truly carefree,
Truly not deluded.
Guarding true purity,
Vying for true merit.
True and true mutually aiding,
True nature crystal-clear.
Then attaining the true wind,
Accomplishing true essence,
Manifesting true countenance.

**For Officer Peng**
Yesterday an officer,
Today a companion of immortals.
Awakening to floating life,
Like bubbles on water.
Suddenly born, suddenly gone,
Hard to preserve, hard to retain.
Then becoming wildly free,
Achieving elegance,
Galloping with the wind.
Heart and mind at ease,
Roaming with clouds and water.
Taking qi, wealth,
Wine, and sensuality as foes.
Dharma name: "Thus Thus,"
Daoist name: "Rest Rest."
Recognizing the original face,
Without coming or going—
A fine cause.

**For Masters Yang and Ma of Fufeng County**
Wishing that each person
Pierce through floating life,
Swiftly withdrawing,
Fiercely abandoning worldly passions.
Leaving wife, parting from children,
Cutting off profit, forgetting fame.
Then suddenly awakening,
Suddenly enlightened,
Instantly clear.
Tigers roar, dragons chant,
Qi fresh, spirit clear.
Engaging in true cultivation,
Refining mercury, cooking lead.
Heart balanced, conduct complete,
Elixir formed, merit accomplished.
Then riding clouds and rainbow,
Morning court before the Jade Emperor,
Dwelling in Penglai.

**Zhang the Supervisor of Qiyang Town Asks About Cultivation**
Do not ask about causes,
Each must cultivate.
The ancients’ words—
Two phrases worth hearing:
Each person has a share,
Each is perfectly luminous.
Only when affairs are sparse,
Heart pure and still,
Is longevity attained.
Primordial qi abundant,
Great Dharma accomplished.
Establishing the initial contemplation,
Sun and moon still.
Radiance shining,
Dragon and tiger balanced.
Feeling the original true,
Ever tranquil,
Forever at peace.

**For Attendant Yan**
This Attendant Yan,
Originally an immortal.
Externally cultivating,
Mistaking the cause.
Hearing my exhortation,
Seeking the hidden, searching the mysterious.
Then abandoning splendor,
Leaving the dusty realm,
Visiting forests and springs.

**Cultivating with Pure Intent**

With pure intent and a clear heart,
Till and sow the Elixir Field.
Ever refining breath,
Soft and unbroken.
The lamp of life shines bright,
The moon of nature full and round.
When merit is complete,
Transcend and ascend,
Attain the heavens.

**For Elder Ziyang of Bai River and Abbot Feng**

Elder Feng of Bai River,
From Fufeng of Ninghai.
With Elder Ziyang’s immortal visit,
Three minds as one,
One will in triple harmony.
Subduing demons and fiends,
Seizing fierce tigers,
Capturing flood dragons.
Worldly cares all forgotten,
True qi harmonious and surging.
Naturally awakened,
Discerning the numinous trace.
Golden Elixir radiant,
Jade nature crystalline.
When merit is complete,
Ascend to the upper realms,
Dwell in Penglai’s palace.

**For Disciple Liu Juji**

I urge you, scholar,
Awaken early to this fleeting life.
Abandon glory,
Roam beyond the mundane.
Without thought, without worry,
Without love, without hate.
Let the idle heart wander,
Seeking cloud companions,
Visiting misty friends.
Ever abiding in truth,
Ever striving for purity.
Through cultivation,
Naturally luminous.
Lead becomes mercury’s medicine,
Mercury the essence of lead.
Refining the Great Elixir,
Ride the phoenix,
Journey to Penglai.

**For the Three Elders of Sanshui**

Suddenly awakened to impermanence,
Cease greed and stinginess.
Break free from the wheel,
No longer clinging to wife and child.
Escape the fiery household,
Cast off indulgence and desire.
Hair like tangled hemp,
Face like grime,
Speech like kindness.
All affairs forgotten,
Resolve to refine in the hermitage.
Eradicating the corpse-worms,
Spreading clouds and mist.
Delving into the subtle,
Aligning with the Dao and virtue.
Then expounding the profound,
Exploring the six and six,
Discoursing on the three and three.

**For Lingyangzi Li Dacheng**

Fully awakened to the Yang Primordial,
Grasp and guide the Yang.
To let Yang and Yang
Pierce earth and penetrate heaven.
Yang traverses the eight vessels,
Yang permeates the three fields.
Sensing the one Yang’s cycle,
The one Yang’s completion,
The one Yang’s wholeness.
Water nurtures the numinous smoke,
Fire nurtures the numinous spring.
Ever numinous,
True excellence transmitted.
Numinous cinnabar without leakage,
Numinous substance firm and steadfast.
Then coalescing numinous light,
Becoming a numinous treasure,
Achieving numinous immortality.

**For Zhang Dawu of Huating**

The greatly awakened,
Able to set the heart at ease.
Forsaking fame and profit,
Beyond the sea of love and mountain of favor.
Eating without seeking fullness,
Dwelling without seeking comfort.
No wild thoughts,
No carelessness,
No high aspirations.
Qi harmonious and flowing,
Sweet dew gentle and slow.
Using oxen and sheep,
Cartloads returned in kind.
Kan and Li conjoined,
Dragon and tiger entwined.
Attaining the utmost subtlety,
Water essence warm,
Fire essence cold.

**For Abbot Wang of the Western Hermitage in Huating County**

Vowing to shun rich flavors,
Delighting in begging for scraps.
With clarity,
Transforming foolishness.
Not dwelling in the abbot’s quarters,
Not residing in ornate halls.
Turning the bathhouse
Into a sleeping chamber,
Curled in repose.
Externally joyless,
Internally nurturing true countenance.
Sighing at the dusty world,
Alone embracing tranquility.
When merit is complete,
Departing the mortal realm,
Toward the Great Brahma Heaven,
The cloud-grotto,
Ranked among the immortals.

**Awakening to Yellow Grain (Originally "Swallow Returns to the Beam")**

The tune was originally "Swallow Returns to the Beam,"
Lacking depth,
Too ordinary.
Missing Master Pure Yang,
Thus renamed,
"Awakening to Yellow Grain."
A hundred years—a fleeting dream,
Upon awakening,
Abandon home.
Ever pure, ever striving,
Abiding in the true constant.
Accumulating merit and conduct,
Journeying to Penglai’s estate.

**Dwelling in a Thatched Hut in Zhongnan #3**

Dong Xuan’s unyielding neck was no common trait,
Like a swallow’s chin,
No misfortune.
A beard grown long in vain—no festering sore,
No broken skin,
What harm is there?
Daoists, poor yet resourceful,
No armpit bags,
Using leather sacks.
Propping the chin, hanging to endure heat and cold,
Within the wrapping,
A myriad fragrances.

**For Master Yang of Xingping**

The principle transmitted in secret is most profound,
Within water,
Gold naturally born.
This person, though mute, can chant,
Able to tread clouds,
Dragging cloud sleeves.
Pondering the ancient and modern path to immortality,
Now as in the past,
Past as now.
Through the ages, rare to meet a kindred spirit,
Those who know the tune,
Seem to match me.

**Warbling the Ugly Slave (Originally "Adding Words to the Ugly Slave")**

At the Purple Ultimate Palace,
Suddenly hearing the cries of the neighboring butcher,
Thus composing this verse.

Daoist followers in Laizhou perform the Yellow Register rite,
Each devout.
All single-minded,
Inviting me to silently recite the sutras,
Aiding the departed spirits.
Alas! The neighboring butcher,
Heedless of the future,
Slaughtering for a living,
The pigs’ pained wails unbearable to hear.
Most heartrending.

**For the Jiao Master Liu Daguan**

**For the Pengcheng Brothers, All in Official Splendor**

The Pengcheng brothers, all of official bearing,
A household of wealth and honor.
Fond of glory and splendor,
Yet slow to turn their hearts and awaken to falling blossoms.
Their path diverges.
If my kin would but seek the profound principle,
Another livelihood awaits.
Furnace-tempered cinnabar,
The great elixir refined, ascending in rainbow hues.
Sailing the immortal raft.

**For Liu Shujian and Ma Changji**

My kin, Shujian and Changji,
Both serving as inspectors.
Unversed in indulgence,
They rush to and fro, greedy for fame and profit.
How foolish they seem!
I urge them to gather their primordial yang early,
Why cling to wife and child?
Erect a cloud hermitage,
A single profound word, no vulgar chatter.
Departing the dust to seek the truth.

**For the Chief of the Laizhou Equality Assembly**

The world tells of the speckled bamboo and the fair one’s tears,
All mere empty talk.
Struck by the Three Corpses,
Blood-stained spots appear—most wondrous indeed.
Ma Feng knows.
Devote yourself to uprightness, wielding no partial staff,
Mock not the humble.
Best to wander idly,
Banishing all demons, the jade nature shines.
Bound for the Jasper Pool.

**Ode to the Bamboo Staff**

I wish you to adorn the carefree traveler,
Knee of crane, ever at his side.
Strolling through clouds and mist,
Laughing proudly in the pure wind by the moonlit stream.
Joy in serenity.
Even the reed of the sea has Lü’s second integrity,
The yang number clearly known.
Harmonious with the Dao,
A fine companion for cloud-roving, wind-footed steeds.
Do not refuse.

**Self-Lament**

**Reflection on the Self**

This body, worn and tattered as a thatched hut,
Dripping with rain, torn by the wind.
It draws fire and summons smoke,
Riddled with rat holes, snake burrows—its pillars askew.
Yet all can be made firm.
Should a master appear, it transforms into a cavern of silver mist,
Restored to a cloud-borne pavilion.
Pearl curtains hang,
And one delights in the radiance of an unending day.
Surely ascension awaits.

**Awakening**

I awoke to refine the treasure within,
No longer flaunting beard or brow.
Only the joy of stillness remains,
Dispensing benevolent winds without bias or favor.
May my resolve stand firm.
I urge others to see through the dream of floating life,
To forsake the allure of ornate carriages.
No need to gaze upon curtains—
Follow me soaring into the grotto-heaven,
To become an immortal.

**Self-Admonition**

Once, in my cups, I grew careless,
Vowing never again to raise the goblet.
Seeing through fleeting wealth,
I no longer contend in vain, nor bury myself in desire.
Thus I avoid calamity.
Again and again, I chance upon the path of cultivation,
Purifying the spirit’s terrace.
I guard the sacred embryo,
Waiting for the luminous pearl to become a child,
Bound for Penglai.

**Karma’s Weight**

In a past life, I sowed no blessings for this one,
Begging in the streets.
Frozen and starving, I wandered in distress,
My heart like a boiling cauldron, seared by suffering.
I prayed for mercy.
Clearly, a single coin given,
Secretly repays the worthy.
The greatest affinity—
Since ancient times, compassion alone makes immortals.
No empty words.

**Tea and Wine, the Affairs of Human Sentiment**

Tea comes, wine goes—mere worldly custom,
Not the root of the Dao.
Only to offer, only to reciprocate,
Wine departs, yet no tea returns in kind.
Thus enmity is born.

To pity the poor and set out congee, seeking no reward,
Is virtue built in secret.
Better still, true cultivation—
Surely one shall gaze upon the Ten Isles in days to come,
Treading the clouds in wander.

**Relieving Hunger, Together Serving Winter’s Congee**

With bowed head, I salute the noble lords,
Who join to set out congee for the starving through three winters.
May each household prosper,
And this small act of compassion—
A measure of rice to succor the poor—
Find goodly favor.

The heart of the Dao abides in constant good deeds,
As nature and destiny merge in harmony.
When the mind is truly open,
It binds the horse, seizes the monkey,
And leads forth tiger and dragon,
Bound for the Peng Palace.

**The World’s Love of Convenience**

Every mortal clings to what seems advantageous,
Vying for gain.
Scheming with cunning,
They win what seems profitable—yet it is loss.
Few understand.

I urge them: set aside this "convenience,"
Build virtue through giving.
Not out of folly,
But to secretly amass vast blessings,
Ascending to the Purple Tenuity,
To become an immortal and return.

**Floating Clouds and Wealth**

Floating clouds gather and scatter like wealth—
Ill-gotten gains,
Do not covet them,
For they bring calamity and invite disaster.
How unwise.

Better to cultivate a mind of equanimity,
Where none are harmed.

**Far Superior to Fasting**

Far superior to fasting,
It ensures one avoids the precipice in days to come.
Bound for Penglai.

**Winter Porridge**

Three winters’ porridge should endure,
Year after year the same.
With steadfast compassion,
One sows true fields of blessing in this life.
No loss for the wise.
Though but a measure of rice is given,
The blessings gained are boundless.
When merit’s work is complete,
One is certain to ascend as an immortal,
Rising to the azure heavens.

**Preparing Offerings**

Before the fast, prepare incense and fire,
Supply the hungry and poor with diligence.
Surely a noble soul lies hidden within—
Do not take them lightly.
I have now received the true message,
And share it with others—one must be reverent,
As solemn as when sacrificing to the gods,
Meeting the true with truth.

**Beggars in the Streets**

Those starving and freezing in the streets,
Receive with joy and pity.
Serve them as you would immortals,
Lest a sage be hidden among them.
Be wholehearted in this.
Better than performing ten grand jiao rites,
Or sowing other karmic seeds.
When virtuous deeds are complete,
One is certain to step upon the azure lotus,
And go to pay homage to the Origin.

**Winter Porridge for the Needy**

Three winters’ porridge should relieve distress,
For the hungry are pitiable.
A fine deed worth spreading—
When others hear of this good cause,
They too will follow.
Relieving poverty and lifting suffering brings merciful blessings,
Merit without end.
Superior to burning sandalwood and aloes,
It ensures one ascends to heaven in days to come,
To become a divine immortal.

**In the Kitchen, Heed Fu Feng’s Admonition**

When cooking porridge, do not make it thin.
Let it be thick and hearty,
Lest you deceive the bellies of others.
Awaken compassion.
Day after day, never weary in heart,
And begin at the proper hour.
Dispel the biting cold,
And never neglect this true merit.
Great fortune shall be yours.

**Compassionate Daoist Friends**

Compassionate Daoist friends take pity on the poor and destitute,
Setting out porridge for three winters.
All shall gain true merit,
And with devout sincerity, see it through to the end.
Year after year, the offering continues.
Kindness without waste—when others hear of it,
They too shall wish for household abundance.
Those who aid the poor
Shall surely not be left empty-handed in days to come,
But ascend to the immortal palaces.

**A Thousand Households, Ten Thousand Doors**

Let all people heed this exhortation,
And cultivate good causes.
Take pity on the hungry,
And together provide porridge for three winters to relieve the poor.
Blessings shall overflow.
A scoop or half a handful of compassionate rice
Holds merit no light matter.
Far greater than reciting scriptures,
A merciful heart reaches the Jade Capital,
And inscribes one’s name among the immortals.

**Wind Like Blades, Snow Like Arrows**

The three winters bring bitter suffering—
Have mercy on the poor children.
No clothes upon their backs,
No food within their mouths, ever gnawed by hunger.
How wretched their plight.
Now is the time for all to perform virtuous deeds,
And awaken compassion.
Rescue the drowning, uphold the faltering,
And provide porridge for a hundred days.
This shall build the ladder to immortality.
*[To Master Sun]*
Setting out porridge in winter brings manifold benefits.
I urge Master Sun, as deputy director, to take care
That it never be discontinued.
With deep gratitude.
I humbly present two short lyrics:

Porridge set out in winter graces temple and abbey,
A virtuous deed that shines.
Cast aside all worry,
And realize that acts of compassion run deepest.
All shall hold you in esteem.
Never grow weary or impatient,
For this surpasses burning sandalwood and aloes.
Seek the wondrous in quiet moments,
Where water and fire give birth to gold within jade,
And ascend to the jasper peaks.

Where does Deputy Director Sun reside?
At the Purple Ultimate Palace.
Receiving guests with humility,
He treats high and low alike, moving his own person—
Like a drawn bow.

I urge the worthy to recognize early the true cultivation,
To revolve the numinous palace.
Cease all excessive reverence,
For the brocade arrow, fine as silk, strikes the precious body—
No bow is needed.

*Departing the Sea of Suffering*
*(Following the rhyme of Master Chongyang)*

By karmic encounter, one departs the sea of suffering,
Cultivating truth in stillness and solitude.
Within the true wind,
Seize the true gale.
Plant jade and jasper,
And true auspices fill the azure sky.
Draw forth the true jade hare,
The true golden rooster—
Naturally, they dissolve all.
Gather further the true dragon and true tiger, coiling around,
For the true image will not spare even the partial.
Truly indistinct, truly manifest,
One sees the true infant and true maiden beckoning.
Seek the true Departure, the true Block, the true place,
To truly, truly aid one another and ingest the numinous sprout.
Suddenly, the primordial true visage coalesces,
Through true purity,
With harmonious effort and power.
Depart for Peng Isle,
To pay homage to Master Chongyang,
And abide in eternal freedom.

**Cultivating the Dao (Idle Amidst a Hundred Flowers)**
*Offending the Proper Office*

Strive to cultivate the Dao amidst the common stream,
Strive to break the stubborn and unyielding.
Strive to subdue the heart, forgetting wine and sensual pleasures,
Wealth, qi, self, and others.
Strive not to return home,
Ever striving to awaken to pure poverty,
Passing days in carefree indolence.
Strive to achieve the fruition of success,
Strive to be without the slightest dust,
Refining the true fire of eternal life.
Strive to refine the seven reversals and nine returns,
A radiant elixir pearl.
Strive to rise in compassion,
Ever striving to be free from contention,
Striving early to ride the clouds.

*Grinding the Elixir*
*For Yunzhongzi, Su Xuan*

Yunzhongzi, you are Master Su,
Hear me—do not let your topknot loosen.
Wear the Huayang cap, the Nine Peaks kerchief.
Follow the path of transformation, acting for the mountain folk,
Cloud-roaming the northwest to visit Kongtong.
Expound good affinities, establish the teachings’ wind.
Exhort all fellow Daoists to seek the Dao.

Ma Fengzi, who has not grasped the mysterious,
Whose nature is dull and knowledge dim, not at ease—
Relying on me in vain, wasting your worth.
Hear my counsel, do not delay,
Swiftly leave me to engage in Chan.
Then you will have the Dao, and be upright.

*Departing the Dust*

Depart the dusty net, escape the mundane cage,
Hair disheveled, face grimed, appearing foolish and ignorant.
Eyes like the blind, ears like the deaf.
Gold for arrows, jade for the bow,
The wooden man shoots through the crystal palace.
Proceed to Peng and Ying, the jade path opens.

*For Wuweizi of Zhongtiao Mountain*

Will as the sword, wisdom as the blade,
The stone maiden splits jade to reveal the golden turtle.
Playing upon the blue lotus, leaping the azure waves.
Drinking the elixir pellet, surpassing fragrant wine—
The young master in scarlet robes,
Striking the cloud waist, ten thousand times over.

*For Wang Daizhao of Huazhou, Seeking Lyrics*

Wang Daizhao, skilled in capturing spirits,
Whose daily thoughts and intentions dwell in others.
Forgetting even your own self,
As if awakening, emerging from the sea of delusion,
Passing days in carefree ease—la-li...
Rejoicing in tranquility, attaining true awakening.

*For the Pure and Secluded Adept*

Do not cling stubbornly, do not be foolishly obstinate,
Do not be deluded by false appearances, do not be stingy or greedy.
Do not give rise to sorrow, do not harbor shame.
Hear my counsel, seek the capital,
Passing days in carefree ease, attaining true joy.
Guard purity, congeal the great elixir.

*For Lan Jue of Jingzhao, Xie Jingren*

Do not cling, do not covet,
Do not let idle sorrows arise in your heart.
In dwelling and moving, ever free.
If you can do this, engage in true cultivation,
Seizing the ape, catching the horse, refining the frost orb.
When the practice is complete, proceed to the Ten Isles.

*For Academician Li*

Zhang Duzhi, most harried,
All because of his toiling hands, too entangled.
Entangled, with no recourse.
Hear my counsel, leave your nest,
In leisure, leisure, leisure, refine harmony.
Attain true cultivation, ascend the Great Canopy.

*For Three Daoist Friends of Zhongnan*

Zhang Qiantian, Mu Ziqian,
Li Gongshi and others, attached to family ties—
How may they grasp the wondrous mystery?
Depart the sea of the vulgar, by the waters and clouds,
At the Immortal’s Manor, plant golden lotuses.
When the practice is complete, the moon of nature is full.

*For Jia the Immortal of Sanshui*

Flaming fire, rolling boiling water,
Within, a single point of martial coolness.
Even more exquisite, exceptionally fragrant.
Generating auspiciousness, emitting auspicious light,
Auspicious light and radiance congeal into red frost.
Producing the fetal immortal, manifesting the Jade Sovereign.

*For the Three Bi Masters of Li Springs*

Externally, do not cling; externally, do not seek,
Externally, there are no good causes.
Externally, no truth; external matters, cease.
Internally, it may be mended; internally, it may be cultivated,
Internally, in purity, roaming the waters and clouds.
Internally, luminous; internally, the countenance is complete.

*In Reply to Magistrate Xiao of Longzhou*

Magistrate Xiao of Longzhou asks whether the child to come will be son or daughter,
Whether there will be calamities or misfortunes, and seeks lyrics.

A good nature, a good disposition,
No need for incense or fasting.
Wearing clouds as a wrap, calamities are averted.
Internally cultivate an extraordinary embryo,
Forgetting scheming, cutting off thoughts, shielding from dust.
Producing a numinous child, possessing great talent.

*Linked Pearls*

Conceal your light well, mend your bones,
Bones without flaws, the numinous embryo is firm.
The embryo pure, the child pure.
The child at play, playing cleverly,
Unruly yet fearing sensuality and wealth.
Without wealth and sensuality, buried in the earth.

*For Magistrate Wanyan of Huating*

The magistrate’s daughter, a true maiden,
Approaching sixteen, delighting in natural truth.
Daring to seek, freely seeking truth.
Heaven-endowed nature, yearning for cultivation,
In time, when merit is complete, the inner true self is perfected.
Riding auspicious clouds, paying homage to the highest immortals.

*For Vice Prefect Li of Mizhou, Seeking a Staff*

A staff of divine longevity, to whom shall it be sent?
To Vice Prefect Li of Longxi, to brush aside the red dust.
Clearing the path, departing the bitter ford.
Ever carrying it, forever as a kin,
Seizing the ape, catching the horse, harmonizing qi and spirit,
Lifting the round image to reveal the original true self.

*Again*

A staff of divine longevity, presented to the lady,
To brush aside the world’s net, to clear the dust.
Assisting her steps, emerging from the ford of love.
Striking where needed, leaning as a kin,
Knocking away darkness, forever clarifying the spirit.
Lifting the bright moon, manifesting the utmost truth.

*For the Daoist Assembly of the Five Meetings*

Hearts in equanimity, longevity extended,
Cultivating the seven treasures, gathering the three luminaries.
Awakening to the complete truth, all things forgotten.
Jade flowers bloom, golden lotuses fragrant,
Fragrant flavors filling the fasting bowels.
When the practice is complete, the Jade Sovereign appears.

*For Yu Qingyi of Ninghai Prefecture*

The wondrous within the mysterious, beyond words,
I exhort you: do not let the horse and ape run wild.
Burn heart incense, reach the sages.
The sages rejoice, bestowing good affinities,
In secret, meticulously clearing the root source.
The nature numinous, attaining immortality.

*For Ma Yangao of Wendeng*

The wine of longevity, the cup of peace,
Able to cure a hundred ailments, just in time.
Assisting pure chanting, delighting in the Dao’s return.
Presenting the wine, the phoenix... cup,
At the Fragrant Mountain gathering, cherishing the fragrant hour.
The drunken immortal’s chant, returning beneath the moon.

*For Master Zhang Wuchen*

Seizing the cloud horse, releasing the cloud carriage,
Singing and dancing in unrestrained indulgence.
Letting others laugh at my folly.
Understanding the six sixes, awakening to the three threes,
The three threes and six sixes, tasting fragrant sweetness.

Gathering broadly, not a matter of greed.
*To the Tune of "Immortal by the River" – Harmonizing with Zhao the Palace Examiner*

□ Seeking the bedrock of metal and wood, □ ever youthful in purity.
□ Ah, within and without, attaining carefree ease.

Dismantling the character *jin* to begin.
*The Mirror of Pure Heart* (originally titled *The Distant Red Window*)

In my early days, as abbot,
Diligently I received cloud companions and rosy friends.
From time to time, severing worldly ties,
Gradually, I came to awakening.
When the awakened heart opened, I then encountered
My original master, who sent me
Specifically to transform and deliver.
Expounding the wondrous mystery, dispelling foolish confusion,
I sought to guide them to the Penglai Palace.

Again:
The good sprout grows, as abbot,
All day long, trusting in extraordinary companions.
Naturally attaining fine affinities,
The heart’s awakening unfolds.
Once the heart’s head opens, decisive encounter follows.
Truly, through cultivation, relying further on the master’s deliverance,
Responding to the immortal’s summons, with merit and conduct unblemished,
They ride the clouds to the Purple Palace.

*Attaining Encounter #3*
Encountering the Wind Immortal, discussing what is ever-convenient.

Forsaking wife and children, no longer meet again.
Beyond the mundane, vast and carefree,
Leaving behind the perceptions of sentient beings.
A great person, with courageous resolve—
How could one yield to wine and sensuality,
To qi and wealth, frittering time away?
Wielding the sword of wisdom, severing all attachments,
The immortal embryo appears through cultivation.

Abandoning the home,
Breaking the reins of fame,
Striking the shackles of profit.
Love’s ocean, gratitude’s mountain—
All seen through at once.
Leaving the household’s ties,
The path stretches three thousand leagues,
Like a lone cloud or wild crane.

With a heart of ambition,
Too great by half.
Today, before all,
I must speak plainly:
In desolation, endure humiliation and poverty,
No longer permitting duality.

Delighting in the true wind—
The wind of the Horse, how fine!
Shaking off household entanglements,
Free from vexation and sorrow.
From now on, no more recklessness,
But wholeheartedly devoting to the Dao.

Purifying the spirit furnace,
Cleansing the cinnabar crucible.
Refining mercury, smelting lead,
Warding off yin depletion.
When the first yang arises,
The great elixir shimmers—
One has a share in dwelling on Penglai Isle.

Lamenting past errors,
First leaving home,
Seeking Dao companions.

Like a fierce tiger,
Descending the mountain to roam.
Never having tempered the stubborn heart,
Lightly touched, it roars in fury.
Flaunting many skills,
Boasting fine hands.
Transcribing famous formulas,
Devoted to saving others.
Though *Pingwei San* may be absent,
There is no lack of potent qi medicines.

Rejoicing in this present truth—
The Dharma candle, let it burn as it will.
No self, no other,
Smoke disperses, fire extinguishes.
Devoted to cultivating
The immortal of forbearance,
Willing to forsake distinctions of right and wrong.
No anger, no joy,
Full to the brim with ice and snow.
Naturally, the heart-ground becomes cool,
How could I then grow heated?

**Searching for One’s Faults**
Searching for one’s faults,
Searching for one’s faults.
Since entering the Dao,
There has been no great transgression—
Only that I should not have
Revealed the mystery of the subtle mechanism,
For this is a grievous fault.
Knowing my fault,
Knowing my fault,
To avoid past errors,
I must atone with merit.
Abiding in non-action,
The heart arises in true compassion,
Hoping the sages will forgive my transgression.

**The Ancestral Hut’s Enclosure**
One lotus pond,
Two cloud companions.
Three pines, four cypresses,
Five weeping willows.
Erecting a surrounding wall,
Encircling the distant Cloud Hut,
Shielding the inner retreat from bustle.

The Green Dragon soars,
The White Tiger roars.
Jade maiden and golden infant,
Naturally pure and elegant.
Transcending creation,
The divine pearl is formed,
Awaiting the sages to bring it to fruition.

**Ode to Chang’an**
Speaking of Chang’an,
So many fine things.
Truly, each day,
Three immortals visit the market.
Half the city’s folk
Engage in trade,
The other half cultivate true qi.

Long-lived people,
Most numerous here.
Knowing cause and effect,
They early quiet the heart-ground.
How flourish the good affinities—
Each year, what is the custom?
A thousand Dao gatherings arise.

**Sent to Three Elder Daoist Brothers: Tan, Liu, and Qiu, in Deer Hide**
Elder Brother Changzhen,
Younger Brothers Liu and Qiu.
Long life, long spring,
Dharma kin of the same generation.
Wearing the lazy robe,
Clad in deer hide,
As our original master taught.

Younger brother’s cloud-wrapped topknot,
Elder brother’s forked hair.
Early awakened to the Three Awakenings,
One penetrating bright meaning.
My heart’s wish
Is to universally transform the deluded,
Deliver the inner contents to transcendence.

**To Master Iron Li**
Lord of Longxi,
Painfully parted.
At the sixth-month furnace,
Wielding the hammer to forge iron.
Supporting the whole family
In leisure,
While you alone endure scorching heat.

Fire-burned sores,
Sweat dripping blood.
Ten thousand hardships, a thousand toils—
When will it ever end?
The wind of the Horse,
Entices you to turn your head,
To rest within the gate of the Dao.

**Also**
Awakening to karmic ties,
Fiercely parting.
A man’s resolve,
Cutting through iron like nails.
Roaming water and clouds,
Vowing never to look back,
Fleeing the fiery courtyard’s torment.

Attaining coolness,
No more sweat or blood.
The pure jade flask,
Naturally luminous and clear.
Realizing the primal origin—
A single radiant point,
The heart rests, free from dusty entanglements.

**To Elder Master Cheng**
This Master Cheng,
Suddenly awakened.

A household with six sons—
The number of the six thieves.
Look closely:
All are karmic foes,
Better not to gather together.
Cast off the gauze cap,
Don the proper crown.
Seize the horse and ape,
Tame the dragon and tiger.
Await the day
When the elixir gleams bright—
Mount the auspicious simurgh and depart.

**To Zhou, Seventh Official of Jingzhao**
Zhou, the official—
A household of great wealth.
In Chang’an’s census,
The highest-ranked household.
Yet in ten years,
What has risen or fallen?
Not even a pin’s space remains.
Sighing at fame and profit,
So impermanent.
They turn my heart to ash,
Then stir awakening.
Walk the Great Way,
Unwavering in resolve—
Cultivate the unborn, the unceasing.

**To Brother Qiu of Changchun**
You delight in mountains,
I delight in water.
Delighting in water, delighting in mountains—
What use is it all?
Far better to
Purify the mind, still the heart,
Refine the harmonious true qi.
Kan and Li unite,
Wood and Metal play—
Giving birth to the shadowless infant,
Within the Palace of Five Lights.
Then suddenly,
The elixir coalesces, luminous—
Attaining boundless true joy.

Once, playing in the water,
I swiftly saw my error.
Thus I compose this verse
To show those below the hall—
Lest any cling stubbornly.

**To Little Immortal Li**
Li, the fitting monk,
A monk who studies the Dao.
The Dao demands profound subtlety,
Sought daily in inquiry.
Through discussion,
One attains constant purity, constant clarity—
A clear mind and intent are best.
Master the heart well,
Sweep away its dust.
When swept clean,
The secret mystery becomes luminous.
The mystery lies in
Running jade, flying gold—
Gold and jade congeal into the elixir’s treasure.

**To Little Immortal Yang of Hu County**
The cultivator
Must first restrain the eyes.
Seeing other men’s wives,
Do not glance or gaze.
Firmly seize
The mind-horse and heart-ape,
Do not slacken, do not dally.
Remove the self,
Simplify affairs.
Embrace pure poverty, gentle weakness,
Carefree and unconstrained.
Strictly follow
The laws of the land, the decrees of heaven—
Never transgress, never transgress.

**To Abbot Li of West Hermitage**
Abbot Li,
Hear my counsel:
Cease grieving for others,
First rescue yourself.
Trim the lamp of the heart,
Make its light true and bright,
To illumine the central palace.
When the Great Elixir is complete,
The work perfected,
The wakeful, radiant youth
Will naturally appear.
Await the purple script,
The jade summons—
To visit the Jasper Terrace, the Penglai Gardens.

**To Master Yan**
A true man,
A man of resolute virtue.

Steel your resolve, unyielding as iron,
Single-minded, without duality.
In cultivation’s path,
Vow never to return home—
When peril and hardship arise, strengthen your will.
In purity and stillness,
The profound mystery reaches its peak.
Sun and moon exchange their radiance,
Tiger and dragon converge in their hour.
Drink the elixir’s measure,
Nurture the divine cinnabar,
To fulfill the esoteric intent of Double Yang.

**To Mistress Hou Mingyi**
Mistress Hou,
Your heart awakens to enlightenment.
At sixty-nine,
Only now do you begin your repairs.
Though many say,
“The hour is late,”
The horse of the Dao is not yet dusk.
Qi unbroken,
Spirit may yet be secured.
First seize
The mind-horse and heart-ape,
Exert your effort to capture them.
Then naturally,
Life and nature will stabilize,
And you shall ascend as an immortal, returning home.

**Quanzhen Hermitage of Jingzhao**
Immortal Pi Zhang,
Master of construction.
One body, two duties—
Also serving as alms-collector.
Building the hermitage,
A single chamber raised alone,
He entreats the patrons of Chang’an.
On cultivation,
Distinguish guest and host.
Grasp the qi and spirit,
Let them master the body.
Swiftly resolve
The root of life and nature,
To become the master of Penglai’s grotto.

**To Master Li of Chang’an**
Master Li,
Too stubborn, too obstinate.

Beneath the Hall of Complete Perfection,
The hardest to instruct and guide.
In learning cultivation,
They scorn the plow, yet claim,
“The Dao is our sole delight.”
Again and again I urge,
Again and again I warn:
Recognize the five-colored auspicious clouds,
And naturally till the Dao.
Cultivate purple mushrooms,
Radiant with numinous light,
And you shall return to Peng Isle.

**To Xue Daoqing**
In cultivation,
Search and refine with care.
The pure family tradition
Is the wondrous Dharma of the Great Vehicle.
Practice non-action,
The true work of non-doing,
Polishing the mirror of the heart.
Naturally bright,
Naturally enlightened,
You shall save and deliver
The nine generations and seven ancestors.
Toward Peng and Ying,
Vast and carefree,
Your crown and robes shall resemble those of a bodhisattva.

**To Master Liu**
A black ox,
Leading a white calf,
Deep in Caoxi’s valleys,
They follow one another.
Often lying beneath the moon,
Sleeping amid clouds,
Detached from the grasses and trees of the mortal world.
Feasting on the three yang,
Joining the nine beasts,
Mother and child in gentle harmony,
Spared the labor of herding.
Await the day
You ascend to Peng and Ying,
Revealing your original face.

**To Madam Wei the Wind**
Madam Wind,
Bearer of secret mysteries,
Mind pure and heart clear,
Every word is the Dao.
Naturally attaining
True joy, true delight,
Without a trace of vexation.
No flattery,
No arrogance,
Amid jade blossoms,
Gold treasures take form.
Then await
The purple edict’s summons,
To bear the title of Illuminated Immortal.

**To Sun Keda**
Master Sun,
Able to let go,
Steadfast and free,
Penetrating truth, discarding falsehood.
In heart and mind,
Impartial toward all things,
Without a hint of flattery.
Delighting in purity,
Attaining refinement,
Drawing near the numinous youths,
Clear-eyed and unburdened.
Now is the time
To forge good karmic ties,
Roaming as clouds and water, transforming all.

**On Hearing of the Passing of the Wu Brothers, Scholars of the First Rank**
Alas, this floating life,
Heart turned to ashes.
The Wu brothers, scholars of the first rank,
Youthful and pure in their prime.
Who could have known
That in half a month’s time,
They would together meet their end?
Let others awaken,
Let others reflect:
Cast aside worldly ties,
Preserve life and nature in full.
Truly pure,
They speak of escaping rebirth,
Attaining eternal life with certainty.

**Guo the Laywoman of Xingping Joins the Hall of Complete Perfection to Cultivate the Dao**
Laywoman Guo,
With the resolve of a man,
Shears worldly passions,
Fearing life and death.
Far from her husband,
She sews shut the yin gate,
Unmatched in ancient or modern times.
Vigilant to the end,
As at the beginning,
Sages and worthies
Shall secretly uplift you.

Amid non-action, in purity from head to toe,
Dwelling with Ma Gu.

**Master Lu of Pucheng**
Alas, this man,
Broken and worn.
Heedless of peril and ruin,
He toys with the gates of the Dao.
Still, by his own doing,
Unmindful of past transgressions,
How shall he escape great calamity?
Hear my words, cast off entanglements:
Worldly love and dusty passions,
Sever them with a single blade.
Dissolve past karma,
Resume cultivation,
And the winds of Ma Feng shall watch over you.

**Another**
Hair like tangled hemp,
Face like filth.
All affairs forgotten,
The heart free of dust and grime.
Indolent and unrestrained,
Lost in sloth and indulgence,
Begging for scraps with outstretched hands.
Fortunate to know nothing,
Why cling to something?
Embrace the void beyond void,
The elixir of no-leakage.
Seek Penglai,
When merit fills three thousand,
You shall don cloud-sleeved robes.

**Bodhisattva Bo Awaits Inquiry**
Bodhisattva Bo,
Skilled in sculpting,
Boasts of wondrous hands and marvelous craft,
Never ceasing.
Expending spirit,
Muddying water and dragging through mire,
All for the sake of feeding his family.
Yet does the heart awaken?
Does the nature comprehend?
In idle offerings,
To the true Father and Mother.
In purity and clarity,
The elixir is forged,
To ride the green phoenix and depart.

**Yang Awaits Inquiry**
Yang the Craftsman,
Sculpts with skill,
Playing with mud and water,
Never nurturing the vast.
Cease the clamor,
Cease begging for poems,
Turn your heart toward the Dao.
Delve deeply, probe thoroughly,
In purity and clarity,
The mysteries shall reveal themselves.
Qi, spirit, essence—
The elixir of no-leakage complete,
Ride the clouds to Penglai’s isles.

**Elder Bo of Shaohua Seeks [a Response]**
Elder Bo, Elder Bo.

At eighty-four years,
Why awaken the heart to cultivate and nurture?
Reading Chongyang’s *Complete Works of the True*,
Some savor is found.
Speak not of age,
Nor of lifespan’s appearance.
Externally hoary,
Internally unconstrained.
Qi unbroken—
Cultivation remains possible,
Swiftly settling the mind is paramount.

**To Ma Shouqing**
Ma, the Maiden,
Returns once more.
In daily use, non-action,
Leisurely nurturing simplicity.
Cease discourse
On the maiden, the infant, the youthful,
Or where tiger and dragon contend.
Sever worldly ties,
Attain true delight.
Fire extinguished, smoke dispersed,
Qi and spirit firm.
Within, cloud-wandering—
Merit fills the Three Fields,
Ascend Penglai’s immortal path.

**Internal Cultivation: To Master Xu of the Garden**
Alone and steadfast,
Tending the garden.
Treading furrows, pacing ridges,
Yet not walking in vain.
Grasping the jade crucible,
Reversing the flow of numinous waves—
When were hands ever raised?
Watering frequently,
Sprouts and shoots emerge.
Gradually fragrant,
The garden brims with splendor.
From the Palace of Jeweled Petals,
Radiant clouds burst forth,
Emulating the divine elder’s return.

**Gathering the Medicine: To Elder Tian of Longzhou**
To learn cultivation
Is like gathering herbs.
Carrying a basket of purity,
Unstained by defilement.
Wandering deep
Amid white clouds—
When was a hoe ever used?
Summoning the green phoenix,
Beckoning the white crane.
Treading upon the sacred land,
Naturally resplendent.
Beholding the ninefold transmutation,
A single elixir pill complete—
Then gather it into the azure vault.

**Internal Plowing: To Master Mu Zhang**
Dwelling in solitary clarity,
Internally plowing and sowing.
Heart and intent at ease,
Unshaken, unmoved.
In profound obscurity,
A golden ox appears,
Plowing deep in the valley’s fields.
Clear rain descends,
Purple mushrooms rise.
Red phoenix and dark turtle
Come forth to behold the offering.
Hemp and wheat bear
Divine pearls of millet,
Ascending the azure heavens in tribute.

**To Abbot Wang**
When nurturing the family,
What was the state of affairs?

Harried by wife and sons,
As if afflicted in heart.
Chasing profit and fame,
Toiling back and forth—
Too weary, too weary.
Since turning to the Dao,
Ever open and at ease.
Beyond the twin words "nature and life,"
No other deluded thoughts arise.
Seizing tranquility,
Freely roaming and carefree—
How unbounded, how unbounded.

**[Illness Among the Daoist Assembly]**
While dwelling on Mount Zhongnan,
I lived within bare walls,
Legs bared, feet unshod,
Without fire or lamp,
For six years in all.
Suddenly stirred in heart,
I wandered the clouds at will,
Westward to Huating,
Seeking shelter in Shenkan.
By chance, I contracted the Central Plains’ *jin-huo* toxin,
Coughing blood and gasping—
The illness struck with great urgency.
Fellow Daoists offered medicine;
I bowed and received it,
Yet dared not taste.
They urged me:
"Eat raw scallions with strong vinegar
To dispel the poison."
I pondered again and again:
When a Daoist falls ill,
None can heal but oneself.
One must refine the supreme treasure within the body,
And the malady will naturally fade.
Thus I composed a short lyric, *The Mirror of Clarity*,
And respectfully presented it to the assembly,
Hoping for your kind regard.

---
*Ma feng-feng*, five score and six.
Drifting like cloud and water,
Alone and serene.
Riding the celestial wind,
Swaying the luminous radiance,
Ever brightening the candle of inherent nature.
Arriving at Tingchuan,
I lodged in a cellar.
Unawares, I encountered
The Central Plains’ *jin-huo* toxin.
To dissolve the disharmony of the four impermanent forms,
Refine the gold and jade within the body.

**Treating Illness**
When qi does not flow,
The feet and knees suffer.

Mica ointment should be applied and kept ready at all times. For tetanus from wounds, what remedy is there? Grind *huaruishi* finely and sprinkle it.

**Treating Heart Maladies**
*Qingshen* powder. For obstinate dispositions, *fuzi*; for harmonizing the center, *lizhong* pills. If *Lingbao* elixirs are taken in excess, even the bones and marrow may transform.

**To Ju Deyi of Hezhou**
Ju of Hezhou, listen to my words. Cast aside all these techniques and methods. The great Dao of spontaneity and non-action—how could it lie in meticulous manipulation? The *Mirror of Clarity* ever gleams pure, illuminating the myriad conditions, beyond birth and extinction. This original luminous essence shines as bright as the autumn moon.

**To Master Ma**
How free and unburdened, how open and expansive! In sitting, lying, dwelling, and walking, carefree and at ease. Reflect deeply: those entangled in fame and profit—how could they know this flavor? In leisure, cultivate and nurture. Temper that single luminous pearl of spirit until it gleams resplendent. Count thrice the seas’ transformation to mulberry fields—this is but a moment for the immortals.

**To the Ten Palace Examiners of Huating**
Yin Yuqing, Fan Zuxun, Ming Zhongji Meng, Zi Xun, Zi Run, Han Qing, and Xin Zhong the official—all of the Qinghe clan. Cheng Derong, Li Hanchen: ten of our fellowship, all refined and talented. I urge you, gentlemen, to let fame and profit turn to ash and attend early to the perfection of nature and life.

**To Lingyangzi Li Dacheng**
Lingyangzi, you come to bid farewell. Parting is not like the time of welcome. Hear my counsel: travel with purpose, and tend closely to your widowed mother. For us, when the smoke and fire of worldly desires are extinguished, never forget your original resolve—steadily deepen your determination. Walk the great Dao, unfold the primal truth, and summon the clear wind and bright moon.

**To Young Master Liu**
One green ox, two tails. Three eyes surveying above and below. Four hooves white as silver, frolicking through the five directions. The six desires and seven emotions all abandoned. Drinking the eight-flavored nectar, radiance suffuses the body. Within the nine tripods, it transmutes into divine elixir—tenfold perfection complete.

**To Jiranzi**
Practitioners of the Dao, listen closely.

Fasting fare must not be made exquisite beyond measure. What need is there for exotic delicacies of many kinds? A single flavor suffices. In tranquil partaking, contentment is ever found. The ten thousand spirits harmonize in bliss, the alchemical pair rejoices in union. Naturally, the golden elixir coalesces—claiming one’s place among the immortals of Penglai and Yingzhou.

**Daoist Companions Ask About Cultivation**
Cloud companions inquire, rosy friends respond. The matter of nature and life is grave—one must surely deliver oneself. The turning wheel of rebirth is decided in this very life; search diligently, scrub thoroughly. When the blue lotus blooms and the white lotus unfolds, within the lotus canopy the alchemical pair gazes above and below. Proceeding upon the road to Penglai, they dance the *liuma* of eighteen movements.

**To Abbot Yan of Huating’s Yinyuan Cloister**
Liu Ziwen, of penetrating nature, saw three generations of his family—father and sons—all take the tonsure. No longer entangled in outward practices, they recognized the wondrous Dharma of non-doing. Within, all was pure and clear, a numinous treasure pagoda. Jade elephants and golden lions encircled it sevenfold. Suddenly, a resounding *ding-dang* arose, revealing the bodhisattva of wondrous sound.

**Daoist Companions Ask of What Household I Am**
Daoist companions inquire, “Of what household are you?”
I answer: “Pure and still, with no contrivance.”
They laugh and say, “This is mere obstinate emptiness—where do you grasp it?”
To grasp it, I tell you this: the mind-steed and heart-ape must be firmly captured. Naturally, the earth wells forth with sweet springs, and heaven descends with sweet dew.

Again—
Sweet springs well forth, sweet dew descends. Ascending and descending without cease, they naturally moisten the three fields, where purple灵芝 unfurl in abundance. Benevolent sprouts arise, wisdom shoots emerge. Blazing and radiant, they illuminate the jade path. Then they transform into a single divine pearl, pointing the way to Penglai and Yingzhou.

**Exhortation to Disciples**
Avoid vain pretenses, avoid vain pretenses. Do not lean upon non-leaning, nor trifle with the Dao. Preserving nature and life is no ordinary matter—strike decisively and settle it completely. O child of the homeless life, display your skill. Take all former attachments and suddenly, fiercely sever them. With single-minded resolve and unyielding determination, cultivate steadfastly to join the company of immortals.

**To Pei Daqi**
Practitioners of the Dao must keep the heart kind. Yet karmic obstructions and demonic illusions assail them relentlessly. In the twelve hours, the unruly steed and frenzied ape give rise to unceasing evil thoughts. Steel your resolve, temper it constantly. Exterminate them without trace, and war shall never arise again.

**Harmonizing Qi and Spirit, the Elixir of Purity Forms—**
The Embryonic Immortal emerges in manifestation.

**To Li Fei, the Great Recluse**
Practitioner of the Dao, avoid missteps.
Ponder carefully: external joy cannot compare to inner joy.
In constant purity, pure delight arises of itself—
this is the original, true exultation.
No sorrow, no attachment,
free and unbound, qi and spirit blaze radiantly.
When merit is perfected and the Embryonic Immortal revealed,
you shall dance your way back to the Azure Heavens.

**The Melon and Plum Parable**
Beware the floating water-caltrop, fear the sinking plum.
See through the floating caltrop,
and the principle becomes self-evident.
From this moment on, cease flaunting literary arts,
and no longer need you expound on rites.
Wander like clouds upon water, far from your homeland.
Do not cultivate outward appearances—
cultivate only the inner.
Stabilize your breath, attain eternal harmony,
and drink the immortal elixir of longevity.

**Again**
The bitter melon’s stem, the fragrant sweet plum:
abandon bitterness for sweetness,
and the supreme principle becomes clear.
Extinguish ignorance, blend with the world while shining,
and for now, perform worldly rites at leisure.
Seek the ancient capital, traverse the locust groves.
Let the heart dwell beyond things,
let qi gather to replenish the inner.
In the void, nurture the infant spirit,
and drink the celestial elixir of spontaneity.

**Again**
This scholar, surnamed Li in the world,
awakened to the pure stillness of non-action—
the profound principle of spontaneity.
Summoned by the Jade Emperor,
he vied for first place among immortals,
surpassing Kong Li’s inquiry into rites.
Hear my words, return to your homeland.
Dwell once more within the encircling walls,
and diligently cultivate the inner.
When the jade peaches ripen,
the nectar shall flow of itself—
mocking Shen Sheng’s draught of sacrificial wine.

**Again**
Mustard greens are heavy, plums are precious.
Awakened to the suffering of birth and death,
weary of delving into texts and principles.
Diminish flavors, distance yourself from sights and sounds,
and grow tired of studying the *Zhou Rites*.
Gather the Three Lights, release them into the Three Li.
Recognize the discourse of the Three Topknots—
in purity, both inner and outer.
Qi and spirit, the Three Treasures—
when the elixir is formed,
the Three Pure Ones shall bestow their nectar.

**Resolute Determination**
O child of the homeless life, be decisive.
Bite through ignorance with a single snap,
as the fire-drill of delusion bores in.
In all matters of the Dao, temper your resolve with unyielding steel—
then you may be called a man of iron.
Let your will not waver, your heart not stray.
Discern the ancient and modern,
the immortal’s public records.
Through accumulated merit and practice,
fear no hardship—
await the direct crossing to the other shore.

**Thus I Show Fellow Cultivators the Resolute Path to Immortal Fruition**
O child of the homeless life, be decisive.
Sever all ten thousand dusty entanglements at once.
Forget cunning, cut off thoughts, and cultivate immortality—
settle the matter of nature and life completely.
Outwardly foolish, inwardly radiant,
in voice and laughter, bearing the guise of a simpleton.

Rejoice in poverty, sing and dance before the streets,
delight in spreading mats and holding bowls.
O cultivator, take heed—do not err.
Ponder carefully: outer joy cannot compare to inner joy.
In stillness and clarity, true joy and true bliss arise,
as smiles bloom like flowers.
Free from sorrow, free from attachment,
qi and spirit harmonize in ascent, the heart holds no resentment.
Give rise to great goodness, deliver the deluded and lost,
together ascend to the azure heavens.

When encountering foes, seek reconciliation.
Wine, lust, temper, and wealth—forever renounce, forever abstain.
Walk the great Dao, sever the ten thousand entanglements,
and you shall be utterly without hindrance.
Do not deceive the heart, nor fabricate strange deeds.
Recognize the ever-constant, roam freely and at ease.
Abide in non-action, yet let compassion arise in the heart—
such merit and practice are unmatched.

**To My Fourth Younger Brother, Ma Yunfu**
Live in harmony with others, avoid brawls.
Beware of delusion—gambling, gaming, and drinking.
The hidden winds of illness terrify those nearby—
hasten to their rescue.
To banish sickness, shake your sleeves free.
Cultivate beyond the mundane, pristine and pure from the outset.
There is yet another true and eternal Chang’an—
await its fulfillment in time.

**Against Fabricating Strange Deeds**
Feigning madness, shedding worldly burdens—
do not act wildly, nor cast off family ties.

Freed from family entanglements, keep the mind-ground pure.
Do not feign strangeness, nor pretend to be good;
cease reckless talk of spirits and ghosts.
Cold and heat—know to avoid them.
In pursuing the Dao, do not be ashamed
of coarse clothes and simple fare.
Follow the laws of the land, transgress no heavenly precepts—
such is the livelihood of one who cultivates immortality.

**Against Powdering and Washing the Face**
A monastic, craving fine delicacies,
heedless of waste, powders and washes the face.
Eating vegetarian dumplings, pretending they are turtle soup—
what dignity is there in this?
Indulging the palate brings no lasting benefit.
Coarse tea and plain rice suffice to fill the trench.
Delight in poverty, roam in tranquil simplicity—
this is a different kind of insight.

**To Those Who Prepare Noodles**
Noodle-maker, heed my words:
knead firmly, roll thin, slice with care.
At the stove and hearth, do not delay—
add fire and candlelight without pause.
When fragrance arises and it is well-cooked,
season sweetly and harmoniously, filling the hollow with substance.
After the meal, guard against wild thoughts—
preserve the original, unadorned face.

**Admonition to the Drunken**
Do not indulge in drunkenness, do not indulge in drunkenness.
How could a worthy dare act so before officials?
In cultivating the Dao, superior persons do not contend—
truly, I bear you no ill will.
Do not give free rein to desire, do not give free rein to desire.
Refrain from craving the cup; early on, exalt good deeds.
Take hold of your nature and life, perfect them wholly—
pursue the livelihood of an immortal.

**On the Disciples of the Three Teachings**
The reckoning of the Nine Yangs, thoroughly understood—
disciples of the Three Teachings, just emerged from the nest.
In the depth of spring, by good fortune we meet—
what a different kind of joy this is.
No words, no speech,
grasping hands and laughing without end.
Body and mind—no longer like Cold Mountain—
this life is truly reclaimed.

**Truthful Words**
No scholar chases fame, no talk of profit.
Wine, sex, temper, wealth—no thought is given to them.
Worldly affairs—none concern the heart;
seek instead another livelihood.
To preserve the true, one must cultivate qi.
Within purity and clarity, tiger and dragon play.
Attaining the natural, the inner workings turn—
a celestial embryo is born, an immortal emerges.

**Exhortation to Monks and Daoists for Harmony**
Daoists slander monks, monks slander Daoists—
I urge monks and Daoists: cease this mutual defamation.
What should those who have left the household truly be like?
Resolve the matter of nature and life early on.
Strive for unity, delve into the profound.
Refine the spirit and qi, coalesce them into the Three Treasures.
In the realm of True Suchness, ascend to the Tusita Heaven—
in radiant clarity, journey to Peng Island.

**Against Luxury**
Monastic, listen carefully:
in dwelling, be cautious—
do not build grand and splendid structures.
To construct gardens and pavilions pleasing to the eye—
how does this differ from the ways of the worldly?
If asked, "What is it?"
Bamboo fences and thatched huts,
a broken wooden gate,
patched robes of paper and hemp—
this is the livelihood of the Daoist.

**To Master Zhao**
Monastic, temper yourself.

Each one seeks to subdue self and others,
yet how can past karmic debts—deep and profound—
be torn asunder in an instant?
May the heart open, may delusion shatter early.
All things are empty—why contend?
Refining the self’s form *is* the practice;
it will surely bear fruit in time.

**Exhortation to Disciples Seeking the Dao**
In cultivation, dispel false thoughts.
Ponder carefully, and gradually fine conditions will arise.
Leave the self behind early—
seek the Dao, inquire into Chan—
I cannot be your reliance.
In Chang’an, there are those of lofty conduct:
Master Gu Yue, the ancient moon,
and Teacher Yang Pi, the sheepskin-clad.
Serve them with utmost reverence,
learn a measure of self-cultivation.

**To Dharma Master Guo**
Wild and unrestrained,
he wandered idly,
passing through Jingyuan Town,
where archers and soldiers detained him,
seizing him as a spy
without allowing explanation.
Once angered, no remedy remained.
Bound in Guo Lue, he endured imprisonment.
Had it not been for Lord Guo, the prefect’s grace,
when would this ordeal have ended?

**Lament for the World**
Alas! How shallow is human perception—
those who possess ten thousand strings of cash
deem themselves richer than those with a thousand.
Do they ever consider the great limit that looms,
crushing mountains and shattering eggs alike?
If awakened, cast aside worldly ties.
Turn beyond the material—
no more scheming, no more calculation.
Refine spirit and qi until radiant,
to become an immortal companion on Penglai.

**Again**
Xi Shi’s beauty, Pan An’s looks—

Those who understand see it and laugh.
Though the great wind shapes earth and water into form,
in the end, none escape the pit and grave.
May you awaken, may you comprehend.
What use is an imposing, dignified exterior
if within there is nothing profound to cultivate and perfect,
nothing to grasp the nature of life and destiny clearly?

**To Master Zhang**
Master Zhang, named *Wu Yu* ("Without Desire"),
his virtue-title *Wu Zheng* ("Without Contention"),
naturally free from vulgarity.
Further befitting his Daoist name, *Wu Chen* ("Without Dust"),
he delights in pure poverty and solitary lodging.
Jade within gold, gold within jade—
gold and jade in harmonious balance,
exotic fragrance rich and lush.
When the great elixir is complete,
he will ride the cloud-chariot in ease,
enjoying the immortal blessings of Penglai.

**Lament for the World**
Alas! How recklessly people rush.
When fortune favors, they mock those who have lost it.
How can they know that those who now lack fortune
once enjoyed it as you do?
Alas for hollow fame, alas for fleeting profit—
like floating clouds, no lasting plan.
Ponder life and death, seek the Dao, inquire into Chan,
cultivate longevity and enduring vision.

**To Song the Dharma Master of Wendeng**
He performs the talismanic rites, relieving suffering and illness.
Truly, his noble family’s deep and illustrious practice is known.
Even more, he should hasten to cultivate the true,
recognizing the ancestral origin of qi and spirit.
Refine mercury and lead, harmonize dragon and tiger.
Between wood and metal lies the barrier;
the path flows through midnight and noon.
When naturally the luminous pearl coalesces,
he will point the way to Penglai and return.

**To Li Jin of Yidu Prefecture**
Lord of Longxi, named *Qu Bing* ("To Shed Illness"),
his heart’s virtue-title *Qu Hua* ("To Shed Ornament"),
his Daoist name *Qu Chen* ("To Shed Dust")—most essential.
Once awakened, he will shed all things,
and then cultivate and perfect his nature and destiny.
His mind ever clear, his intent ever pure,
his Dharma name further resonates with the Valley Spirit.
The name *Tong Yi* ("Through Unity") is also fitting,
his style *Xian Qing* ("Immortal Minister") well-matched.

**Lament for the World**
Alas! How foolish people’s schemes.
They vie for the hollow fame of a snail’s horn,
the paltry profit of a fly’s head.
Yet once they gain a mere grain’s height,
they laugh at those beneath.
They bicker over right and wrong, vent idle grievances—
how could they awaken to cultivation,
transcend the mundane, and leave the world behind?
With but a little effort in mastering nature and destiny,
they might claim a place among Penglai’s immortals.

**Again**
Those who tend to family—
not one of them understands.

Each parades their cleverness, yet clings to stinginess and greed.
Though Heaven bestows great gifts—startling to relinquish—
dare they not cherish their own lives?
This life, so vital to the body:
one breath failing, the body becomes dirt and dung.
May they awaken swiftly, hasten to cultivate and preserve,
consolidate their qi and spirit—then immortality is assured.

**To Ma Yandu**
Two in-laws, each enlightened.
What they once cherished,
now see as fierce tigers.
Recognize the wuwei, the pure and tranquil family way,
where nothing is contrived.
No stinginess, no joy or anger.
Regulate the breath evenly, continuously nurture within.
Await the day when merit is complete, the work fulfilled—
together they will ascend on clouds.

**To Ling Yi Zi**
Master He, listen closely.
Before your hair is bound in a topknot,
first wear it in twin buns.
Nor has the time come to beg for scraps—
wait until awakening grants them to you.
Attain samadhi and prajna, enter the first ground.
Rely on non-defilement, non-attachment,
the wuwei livelihood.
With a mind pure and clear, penetrate the wondrous and profound—
then the eternal covenant of immortality is yours.

**Why Master He Went to Ninghai to Compose a Lyric for His Fellow Villagers**
Urge your fellow villagers to awaken.
Fleeting profit, fleeting fame—
neither firm nor enduring.
Wife and children are but walking corpses,
the self but stinking rot.
Turn back early, seek the true path.
Learn from Ma’s example,
joyfully return.
Beyond the material world, till the field of the heart—
become companions to the immortals.

**To Master Wei**
□ is pure, □ plays with fire.
□ in empty stillness, tigers rest with dragons.
□ lotus blooms, surpassing all flowers,
□ in karmic deeds of aid.
Awakening, truly rejoice.
□ the wuwei secret of purity,
naturally penetrates the mysteries.
□ self-attained, cease further pursuit—
□ others need not fear death.
*(Composed by dissecting the character "Wei.")*

**White Guanyin, Originally Named White Crane Child**

**To Wu Zhigang**
His playful name belies diligence,
for he is one who nurtures simplicity.
To dress, he’s too lazy to raise his arms;
to eat, too indolent to part his lips.
When his face is grimy, he merely seeks water;
his topknot unkempt, he can’t be bothered to wrap a cloth.
No longer does he dream of worldly toil—
he has awakened to the truth within.

**Again**
The method for long life and eternal vision
requires forgetting all things.
Guard the monkey-mind—it’s easily subdued;
restrain the horse-intent—its wildness is hard to curb.
Draw the tiger to dwell in the dragon’s cave,
tame the dragon to reside in the tiger’s den.
When the two become one,
mount the crane and journey to Penglai’s estate.

**Yanling’s Wondrous Formula, Originally Named Twin Swans**

**Respectfully Following Master Chongyang’s Rhyme**
Fortunate to meet Fengxian, parting from the eastern land.
No entanglements, freely roaming the clouds.
True joy and delight, singing with abandon.
These worldly ties—
one day, they will cease.
Emulating Tian Dan’s fire-oxen strategy,
harnessing metal and wood,
reversing the flow.
The great elixir’s radiance shines—no need to cling to cultivation.
For those lost in the ford,
it becomes a ferryboat.

**Wondrous Gold and Jade Collection, Volume Eight Concludes**

*(The following twenty lyrics use the tune "Daolianzi.")*
*(This lyric uses the tune "Linjiangxian," an acrostic poem.)*
*(The following eighty-four lyrics use the tune "Hongchuanghui.")*
*(The following two lyrics are also titled "Yuan Huige.")*

**Wondrous Gold and Jade Collection, Volume Nine**

**Five Numinous Immortals**

**Borrowing the Willow Lyric’s Rhyme**
Ma’s wind in Ninghai, Chongyang at eighteen.
Foolishly, yet with cunning.
The six dusts severed.
Though carefree and at ease, open-hearted and expansive,
cloud-roaming and water-crossing, the jade-jewel path slick as ice.
Mending Heaven’s rift.
Exert effort to gather the five hues, managing the living snow.
Regulate dragon and tiger, strike the pass and surge through the nodes.
Attain true joy.
Seeing the clear sky’s crystalline purity,
round and upright,
radiant and bright—
it is the moon of one’s own heart.

**To the Penglai Scatterer**
May your worthy years increase, your family’s wealth disperse.
Children and grandchildren filial—
all cunning.
Yet all transcend.
Emulating the Peng and Xu families,
the whole household suddenly awakens,
together crossing to the other shore.
The path of long life, smooth and clear.
The rabbit’s horn rift.
Come and go, playfully observe—
heavenly flowers, auspicious snow.

The golden stem flourishes, loftily free of branches and nodes.
Within, joy abounds.
This is the numinous youth responding to purity,
□□ true bliss—
no sorrow to untie,
only chanting the wind and moon of the crimson dawn.

**To Master Zhao the Eighth**
Horse Wind’s lyrics bow in homage,
to True Tranquility’s Zhao the Eighth.
Ever pure and still—
within, clever and astute.
Horse and ape severed.
Abiding in non-doing, non-making,
penetrating the mysterious and wondrous,
drinking jade nectar,
fragrant and sweet, smooth to the taste.
No excess, no lack.
Naturally, spirit and qi robust,
sleeping on ice, reclining in snow.
Defying cold and heat—
unbound by seasons.
Such joy!
From the heart’s knowing and understanding,
hard to speak, hard to tell,
carefree and unobstructed,
clearly beholding the true moon of the grotto-heaven.

**To Master Dan of Fufeng County**
Awakened, he descended to my presence,
begging eight coins before the street.
In a whirl of motion—
seeming foolish, seeming dim.
All entanglements severed.
In pure clarity, drinking freely,
blade and spoon drunk to intoxication,
the numinous terrace bright and spotless,
naturally lucid and smooth.
Originally without lack.
Within the jade crucible and golden tripod,
yellow sprouts and white snow.
True dragon and tiger—
coiling around the nodes of the pass.
The joy of the alchemical infant.
Bearing Kunlun’s summit,
bursting through clouds and mist,
heaven knows no day or night—
ever revealing one luminous moon.

**To All Daoist Friends**
Horse Wind earnestly implores,
all noble friends of the Dao.
Do not be deluded by the false—
within, what is worthy endures.
Seek longevity.
Employ true effort wholly in
purifying the heart, stilling the mind,
capturing the ape, seizing the horse—
do not let them wander even briefly.
Attain the leakless.
Qi and spirit unite,
cinnabar congeals.
From nothingness—
naturally, the mouth opens.
Discoursing on non-being.
This profound mystery,
joyfully realized and understood—
it turns out the true master
has secretly transmitted it.

**Playing with Cinnabar (Originally titled "Huanxi Sha")**
**In Praise of Perfected Master Yuchan Puming Chengji, Upon His Ascension**

Dwelling in simplicity, embracing emptiness,
what care for south or north, east or west?
Cinnabar exists only in laughter and conversation.
Life and destiny are not governed by heaven and earth.
With one precious word, bidding farewell to the mountain recluse,
the feathered wheel swiftly carries him to Penglai’s palace.

**Arousing Compassion #2**
Ma Yu often relies on Buddhist practice,
from the heart of non-doing, arousing compassion,
responding to cries of suffering as conduct.

All women and men as one’s parents,
seeing their lives and deaths in dire peril—
one must establish a ladder to heaven.

**Establishing the Ladder**
Erecting the true heavenly ladder,
formless, shadowless, without foundation,
a swift path entering non-doing.
At ease, carefree—
true livelihood,
ever pure, ever still, delighting in the subtle.
Naturally, heaven and earth all return.

**To Master Yu**
The candle of nature shines, illuminating the jade flask,
the incense of the heart wafts fragrantly in the golden crucible,
drinking the blade and spoon to intoxication in true suchness.
Before the Flower Calyx Tower, a horse gallops sideways,
in Huayin County, a donkey is ridden backward—
the youth of the Five Spirits holds the divine pearl.

**To Master Hao**
Great awakening—floating life, no attachment to home,
the great vehicle’s essence, unadorned,
great penetration of the mysterious and wondrous, without boasting.
Great virtue establishes true livelihood,
great elixir refined—a fine livelihood,
great merit accomplished, stepping into mist and clouds.

**To the Daoist Under the Hall**
Idle right and wrong must not be heard,
how can one daily engage in self-discourse?
Secretly harming merit and conduct, damaging the subtle vapors.
The tongue is the root of disaster—firmly seal it,
ordinarily, restrain the opening of misfortune’s gate,
naturally, life and destiny endure.

**Self-Recitation**
Breaking precepts, the mountain recluse speaks at length,
enduring others’ shame and humiliation without remorse,
lately, fondly drinking jade nectar.
Mysterious jade, mysterious gold fill the precious tripod,
true man, true woman fill the elixir chamber—
greedily awaiting residence in Penglai’s estate.

**Expressing My Heart**
External pleasures never stir the inner heart,
within, no mouth yet chanting,
each sound pure and elegant, piercing the jade grove.
To truly listen, one must listen yet not hear,
like the deaf and blind—yet can be pursued.
Then, immortals and buddhas become confidants.

**To Masters Gan and Zhang**
Pure and still, non-doing seals the secret mechanism,
golden waves and jade ripples congeal into blade and spoon.
Marvelous! Wondrous! Reaching the most profound subtlety.
Seizing the dim and silent,
able to eat, able to drink, even more able to carry—
from nothingness, nurturing the transformed child.

**To Master Zhu**
One meal of fragrant wild vegetable stew,
facing the stream, bamboo before him, chanting verses,
unfazed by the turning of jia and geng.
What is the Daoist’s true livelihood?
At high noon, striking the third watch,
plowing together with clouds and moon.

**To Yu the Tile of Ninghai**
The water dog spouts smoke, veiling the jade pavilion,
the fire ox enters the sea to plant the magic field,
white lotus blossoms interspersed with blue.
The blue-eyed foreign monk’s brows sweep the earth,
the frost-haired rabbit’s horns pierce the sky—
the Tathāgata’s perfect sign is originally round.

**To the Daoist Under the Hall**
Abandoning family ties, further abandoning the body,
not feeding tigers or saving starving eagles—
seeing through the illusory form, forgetting oneself.
No shame, no disgrace, no defilement,
carefree and unobstructed, qi and spirit clear—
the true buddha within the heart manifests radiance.

**To Li Jichuan of Huating**
Eleven of us comrades came as one,
ten are bound by karma, their hearts not yet extinguished—
do not let them lose footing and fall into the wheel of rebirth.
Early, early, turn to the mysterious and leave the sea of suffering,
leisurely, leisurely refine qi and nurture the numinous embryo—
upon merit’s completion, together ascend to Penglai.

**To Immortal Zhang**
Resolute in cultivation, a true man,
single-minded and devoted, avoiding the three paths,
pure as ice, spotless as jade—without a speck of dust.
In emptiness, human heads joyfully fall,
within the flask, the Dipper’s handle turns freely—
the elixir completed, ninefold refined, riding the cloud chariot.

**To Masters Wang and Liu**
Do not treat cultivation as trivial,
a still body is not as good as a still mind—
circulate the sun and moon, do not let them idle.
Nurture the lower elixir without leakage,
then ascend to the crimson tower to refine the central elixir,
filling the upper numinous palace, attaining the three elixirs.

**Reusing the Previous Rhyme**
Nurturing the three elixirs, yet not idle,
transforming people to enter the Dao, recognizing true leisure—
true joy, true bliss, responding to true idleness.
Further refining the three elixirs into one,
practicing merit to perfection, revealing the divine elixir—
the fetal immortal presents the purple golden elixir.

**To the Daoist Beneath the Hall**
Foul intentions and stubborn minds breed the smoke of the hearth,
gaping mouths and wagging tongues spawn right and wrong—
wounding others, harming oneself, transgressions arise in secret.

The contentious are naturally unkind,
the virtuous do not contend, and good sprouts grow—
the uncontentious superior person attains long life.

**To Master Yan**
Forsaking glory and splendor, dwelling beyond the material,
with focused effort in the wondrous and true,
within the Kan and Li palaces, playing with the pure and void.

Striking jade teeth in the tiger’s maw,
seizing the divine pearl from beneath the black dragon’s chin—
such skill is worthy of my disciple.

**The Equality Assembly (Originally Named the Longing Assembly)**
*Following the Ancient Rhyme*
Words spill carelessly, heedless of tune or measure,
yet I sing and dance to my heart’s content,
letting others laugh as they will.

Rejuvenating the old, returning to youth,
my aim is freedom from sorrow.
Toward the wondrous, I apply effort, searching,
examining closely.

Drinking ambrosia to my fill,
primordial qi swells, sating me.
Tempering the divine elixir,
neither great nor small.

The fetal immortal nurtured,
presents the magic mushroom.
Now, boasting of this,
at last, the Dao is attained.

**The Grotto Heaven (Originally Named Partridge Sky)**
*Sent to Ma Yunfu*
Abandon gambling, drinking, and vouching for others,
lessen the smoke and dust, reduce greed.
Searching for one’s own faults brings lasting benefit,
seeing not the faults of others reaps good causes.

Startled by neither favor nor disgrace,
delighting in purity and poverty,
cultivating the mind, nurturing nature, treasuring spirit.

Persisting thus in successful practice,
the bright moon and clear wind become true companions.

**To Master Yuan #3**
Suddenly recalling fleeting glory pains my heart,
brief honor and fame sink into oblivion.
How much better the carefree wanderer beyond the world,
unlike those bound within the realm, lacking freedom.

Forsaking worldly cares,
delighting in purity and poverty,
in walking, standing, sitting, lying—*lori*...
Refining the elixir of immortality in the jade crucible,
preserving the golden furnace’s deathless truth.

**To Zhaoranzi**
I urge you, do not cling to the deceptive ford,
exchange the Huayang turban for the black silk one.
Not to be drowned in the dust of the world,
but to become a carefree wanderer beyond the material.

Cultivating virtue and power,
fortifying spirit,
tigers and dragons coil and roar.
Mercury and lead naturally form the elixir,
riding the crane, soaring on clouds, paying homage to the Perfected.

**The Elixir Well of the Quanzhen Hermitage**
Digging must reach eighteen feet deep,
sweet springs naturally respond with clear song.
Further, it heals illness—named the Elixir Well,
befitting the mountain recluse’s heart of universal salvation.

Let people heed advice,
become knowing friends,
pursuing the wondrous subtleties of Chongyang.
Purple *zhi*’s radiance shapes form,
the blue-eyed true suchness ascends the jeweled peak.

**Jade Tower Spring (Borrowing the Willow Lyric’s Rhyme)**
*To the Cloud Dweller*
The grotto heaven knows no night nor dawn,
only crimson light and purple mist.
Within the numinous waves, the golden turtle appears,
a thousand strands of silver silk upon its back.

Two spirits, diligent, harness the wind’s chariot,
Kan and Li merge, whispering secrets.
Carving open creation to its subtlest depths,
mastering the true work’s inverted numbers.

**To the Eternal Spring Child #4**
Why seek wealth or nobility?
No need for prose like Bai’s.
Delving into nature and destiny is a fine livelihood,
cherishing the root’s source is the true way to live.

Hiding the mechanism in profound secrecy,
unwilling to boast before others.
Drinking jade nectar by the thousand cups,
cloud friends and rosy companions toast in one intoxication.

**To the Chang’an Child**
Within the grotto, sun and moon know no day or night,
radiant cloud thoroughfares connect jeweled paths.
Above, the purple brain receives the Three Clarities,
below, the Yellow River shines in five colors.

Naturally, rosy clouds weave a delicate abode,
within dwell the immortals of the Three Isles.
Before their traces beyond the clouds are revealed,
they have already arrived before our eyes.

**To the Perfected Truth Child**
In clarity, awakening to auspicious omens,
worthy to be the true heir of the Wind Immortal.
Gathering white snow and yellow sprouts,
forging the divine elixir, the crucible seethes.

The numinous youth, nourished like jade cream,
understands the profoundest mysteries in detail.
Knowing that two or three years in heaven
secretly exchange for ten thousand ages among men.

**To Master Zhang of Panxi**
Refining primordial yang in the golden palace,
preventing dark demons from stealing.
Maintaining purity yields merit,
eternally congealing the divine elixir without leakage.

A heart at leisure, pure as ice and snow,
naturally possesses the deathless moon without night.
Because Kan and Li’s tiger and dragon harmonize,
the human monkey and horse within me are stilled.

**Penglai Pavilion (Originally Named Moon over Qin Tower)**
*To the Two Elders Tan Before the Mountain*
Elder Tan, hasten!
Hasten to welcome the carefree wanderer beyond the world.
Carefree wanderer,
come to transform through affinity,
fortunately unobstructed.

Burning boats and nets, beyond calculation,
four directions praise, yet words fail to describe.
Words fail to describe,
all else clings to the old,
only increasing profit.

Again, hasten to the mysterious,
hasten to become a wise wanderer.

The wise wanderer,
still and clear as the heart-moon,
lets no clouds obstruct.
Death and life, life and death—none can fathom,
yet those who follow me into the Dao transcend drowning.
Transcend drowning,
tiger coils, dragon soars far,
nature rests, life breath stills.

*To Elder Tan*
Hasten, Master Yu!
Keep your heart ever with the boatman.
Boatman,
slaying fish and shrimp takes lives,
sin’s root is never distant.
Take my words—cease wild conjecture,
quickly burn boats and nets to free drowned souls.
Free drowned souls,
to preserve the numinous being,
heel to crown, breath flows unbroken.

*Again*
Hasten through the crucible,
through the crucible’s pressing torment, the crucible’s wanderer.
Crucible’s wanderer,
wife and sons—demonic obstructions,
the wondrous mystery’s wall divides.
Meet me, and grasp the cool clarity,
on the path of cool clarity, hard to drown in karmic ties.
Hard to drown,
qi harmonizes with harmonious qi,
breath regulates, transmission breathes.

*To Master Tan’s Disciple*
Hasten, all people!
All people on the sea become boatmen.
Become boatmen,
karmic bonds ever bind,
blessed affinity ever distant.
Meet me, heed my exhortation deeply,
burn boats and nets—hard to merit drowning.
Hard to merit drowning,
blessed affinity brings felicity,
karmic bonds dissolve, breath stills.

*Again*
□ Hasten, ape!
□ Ape, unmoved—true guest of mine.
True guest of mine,
orally transmit the numinous terrace,
□ gold’s interval divides.
□ Truly cultivate and refine—no common conjecture,
□ pearl’s radiance gleams, hard to drown in dust.
Hard to drown in dust,
□ life’s numinous flame,
□ smoke dissipates, breath stills.
*Dismantle the character "heart" to begin.*

*In Praise of True Man Chongyang*
Leaving the western desert,
Chongyang came to visit Penglai Pavilion.
Penglai Pavilion,
auspicious light drifts,
truly vast and boundless.
Expounding scriptures surpasses dispensing medicine,
the Dao’s honor is naturally the master’s stern majesty.
Master’s stern majesty,
wayward people return to rectitude,
to ascend the azure vault.

*Expressing My Feelings*
Leaving the desert sands,
suddenly forgetting the pavilion within Ninghai’s army.
Within the army’s pavilion,
I turn back no glance,
aspiration clear as the sky’s expanse.
Emptiness and nothingness gather the pellet elixir,
tiger and dragon roar as they please.
As they please,
exhort people to cultivate the Dao,
to save people from the precipice.

*In Praise of True Man Yin*
From the smokeless desert,
within the Immortals’ Gathering Abbey, the Flying Immortal Pavilion.
Flying Immortal Pavilion,
towering and lofty,
half invading the clouds’ expanse.
True Man Yin’s dharma-body, the square-and-round elixir,
people’s reverent hearts dissolve all evil.
Dissolve all evil,
originally numinous beings,
spared from drifting and falling.

*Ode to the Mirage*
Clouds and mist obscure,
crimson light and purple haze form towers and pavilions.
Form towers and pavilions,
phoenixes dance, simurghs fly,
coming and going through the jade expanse.
Immortal retinues welcome the cinnabar elixir,
emptiness and nothingness transform—dragons give birth to majesty.
Dragons give birth to majesty,
Penglai’s three isles,
spread across the azure vault.

*Matching the Rhyme of Zhang Xiuzu’s Palace Examination*
Hasten home!
A traveler from Shandong, dispatched by a document from the west.
Shandong traveler,
three thousand li and more,
passes through distant mountains and barriers.
At that time, vainly guessing my idle thoughts,
now my body is like one drowning.
Like one drowning,
in later years, again speak of
the immortal’s true breath.

*To Ma Yangao*
Hasten together!
In the marketplace, penniless—becoming a sorrowful wanderer.
Becoming a sorrowful wanderer,
praying to officials and superiors,
to avoid loss and separation.
Meet me, recite the spell over wine to forget sorrow,
curing a hundred illnesses like rescuing the drowning.
Like rescuing the drowning,
further arrange and plan,
naturally increasing breath.

*To Abbot Wu’an*
Hasten, Abbot!
Abbot, monk welcoming the immortal guest.

**To the Abbot Wu’an (continued)**
Hasten, immortal guest!
Incense smoke curling, veiling my gaze.
Like hemp-seeds in vision—hard to fathom,
yet a true bond is forged, merit never drowned.
Merit never drowned,
at the Dragon Flower’s three assemblies,
joyful tidings arise.

*To a Disciple*
Hasten in Dao cultivation!
Transcend with singular resolve—no ordinary guest.
No ordinary guest,
facing demons and trials,
shattering barriers and blockades.
In the subtle and wondrous, probe the heart’s depths,
turning deeper awakening far from drowning.
Far from drowning,
like the quail’s nest, the fledgling’s feed,
thoughts forgotten, passions stilled.

*To Lord Zhao*
Hasten in this age!
Ever the companion, cherishing the guest.
Cherishing the guest,
perfecting others’ virtue,
naturally without obstruction.
Meet me, grasp the profound and subtle,
rescuing peril, upholding the drowning.
Upholding the drowning,
naturally the Dao flows,
qi and spirit harmonize, at rest.

*Exhortation to Minister Song*
Hasten, Confucian!
Confucian, unenlightened—a walking corpse.
A walking corpse,
burrowing for livelihood,
without veil or barrier.
Men boast of braving the sea’s vastness,
yet who ponders the skiff drowned in wind and waves?
The skiff drowned—
how can this be endured?
I urge you: cease and rest.

*Exhortation to Return*
Do not hasten so!
Confucians are but Penglai’s guests,
Penglai’s guests,
exiled in the dusty world,
temporarily parted from immortality.
From the primal origin, a single earnest thought—
search it true, hard to burn or drown.
Hard to burn or drown,
turn the light inward, reflect,
cultivate the true, regulate the breath.

*To Song Liulang*
Hasten, wave upon wave!
Hasten, wave upon wave—anxious guest.
Anxious guest,
bound by mountains of grace, seas of love,
a thousand veils, ten thousand barriers.
Meet me, find the path you must,
in the realm of fame and profit—do not drown.
Do not drown,
advance in Dao cultivation,
worldly passions all stilled.

*Again to Song Liulang*
Hasten, Song!
Hastily scheming livelihood—a boatman’s guest.
A boatman’s guest,
amidst towering waves,
no shelter, no barrier.
Where winds and billows rage—how to fathom?
Better burn the nets and rigging to guard against drowning.
Guard against drowning,
or sit idly,
idly regulating the tortoise’s breath.

*To the Two Elders of Gushui, Chi*
Hasten, you two!
Taking my place to guide—knowing guests.
Knowing guests,
urging others toward goodness,
unafraid of mountain divides.
When men burn nets and boats—who could have foreseen?
Such merit and conduct truly hard to drown.
Truly hard to drown,
names transmitted through the world,
naturally without end.

*Again on Cultivation*
Hasten in practice!
Within cultivation—true honored guests.
True honored guests,
inwardly holding the heart’s mirror,
temporarily veiled in form.
To penetrate the numinous, rely on probing,
from the primal origin, awakening fully—able to depart drowning.
Able to depart drowning,
naturally radiant,
all karmic ties stilled.

*To Elder Bing San, "Linked Pearls"*
Hasten, Bing San!
Hasten beyond the world—cultivating the true guest.
Cultivating the true guest,
hear my exhortation,
the world’s dust veils you.
The dust—yet you can truly fathom,
true cultivation hard to return to drowning.
Hard to return to drowning,
sink without care,
forget the ape’s breath, still the mind.

*Again*
Hasten, lost one!
Bound by qi, wealth, wine, lust—foolish guest.
Foolish guest,

Nose regulating true qi,
evenly flowing, at rest.

*To Those Burning Nets and Boats*
Hasten in teaching!
Alas, those turning from the Dao—deluded guests.

clarify the heart, sever thoughts—hard to drown in passion.
Hard to drown in passion,
essence, light, spirit, qi,
lifelong nurtured.

karmic ties obstructing.
Nets and boats burned—no doubt to fathom,
compassionate merit hard to drown.
Hard to drown,
watching others gain fortune,
killing intent all stilled.

*To a Disciple*
Hasten, kindred spirit!
Gird with soft leather—a transcendent guest.
Transcendent guest,
amidst a thousand karmic ties,
transcending, apart.
Carefree beyond the world, probing the mystery,
refining the elixir’s treasure—no sorrow, no drowning.
No sorrow, no drowning,
monkey mind, horse intent,
naturally stilled.

Countless nets and traps burned—beyond measure,

*Golden Lotus Emerging from Jade Flower* (originally titled *Jianzi Mulan Hua*)

**To Master Da Bi**
Master Bi, noble in aspiration,
barred both official hindrance and private demon—heart undivided.
Fierce in resolve, steadfast in cultivation,
able to move mountains—yet his will never wavers.
Worldly ties once severed,
earthly glory leaves no stain.
Worthy to be called a Daoist disciple,
fit to perfect the great elixir furnace.

**Admonishing Magistrate Liu to Release the Parrot**
Green-feathered, red-beaked,
for its gift of speech it only brings itself trouble.
I urge you, cease this—
the clearer its words, the deeper the delusion.
Better to awaken,
seal its beak, hide its cunning, and cherish its brilliance.
All despise it now,
but once freed from the mortal cage, it flies at ease.

**To Master Zhang Zhiguan**
Master Zhang, ever observing,
searches life and destiny, ever watchful.
Seeing through the clamor of dust,
he extinguishes the mortal heart and transcends worldly dust.
Within, he refines and tempers,
true mercury and true lead ever forged.
To behold the golden lotus,
one must deeply plant the jade lotus.

**To Captain Ren**
Captain Ren,
ever rescuing the distressed, ever aiding the urgent.
Departing now for Chunyu,
he repays wholeheartedly with alms-bowl offerings.
Ma Yu of Shandong,
sends words to this worthy household to nurture jade.
Within jade, gold is born—
though mute, it speaks of ancient and modern.

**To Master Liu, Who Bestowed Shoes**
Bestowing shoes upon me,
I grant you, worthy one, the mystery of the profound.
Do not doubt or hesitate—
early sever worldly ties to find what is fitting.
Discussing its origin,
pure and radiant essence is firmly guarded.
Nature does not sink or drift,
resolutely following the lineage of Patriarch Liu, the Sea Toad.

**To Master Jiang, Who Bestowed a Palm-Leaf Fan**
Woven with sturdy reeds,
it relieves suffering and brings forth wondrous scenes.
Heat and vexation vanish—
summoning the wind, summer turns to autumn.
Say not it is mere grass,
though light in substance, it delights the heart.
Grateful to Lord Jiang,
who bestowed coolness, sparing me the climb upstairs.

**Another**
□gold and mercury settled,
□wealth and honor—no scene of mine.
□why worry?
□lamenting fleeting life, temples touched by autumn.
□wisdom’s grass sprouts,
□early cultivate the heart—truly the best.
□Dao surpasses nobility,
□sleeve carries clouds to visit the jade tower.

*Breaking the Character "Wood" to Begin*

**To Granary Officer Lu Wuyi of Laizhou**
Officer Lu,
intent on keeping heart and horse in check.
Yet to refine the elixir,
he sends me wearily to Wu Pass.
Swiftly turn back carriage and horse—
to preserve the true, first abandon the false.
Deeds and conduct must be complete,
then surely one will gaze upon the Ten Isles.

**Another**
Even if summoned to serve,
how compares it to pure cultivation, undivided?
Mastering the three elixirs,
far surpasses gaining high office.
Firmly restrain the mind-horse,
tightly bind the heart-ape—let no falsehood remain.
When the numinous substance is perfected,
one beholds within the gourd myriad isles.

**To Abbot Liu of Pure Tranquility Hermitage**
Abbot of Pengcheng Hermitage,
joyfully donates a garden to build the hermitage.
Establishing this good affinity,
planting a field of future blessings and fortune.
The whole family cultivates goodness,
truly the ground of Daoist practice.
Better still, purify the heart—
spirit and qi harmoniously ascend the precious peak.

**To Supervisor Liu**

*Breaking the Character □ to Begin*

**Linked Pearls Following Supervisor Jiu’s Rhyme**
Rest the heart for years,
years long, rest the heart to achieve the subtlest wonder.
Wonderful to grind the heart,
polishing it open, swift as a shuttle.
Shuttle flies, jade nature—
nature flawless, truly pure and clean.
Pure, what sorrow?
Sorrow and vexation—my heart never rests.

**Pure Truth Master Yao Requests a Lyric**
Destiny nurtures nature,
within water, gold is born—true root and handle.
Tiger coils, dragon entwines,
running jade, flying gold, congealing into a mass.
Freely drink the jade powder,
giving birth to an embryo immortal, upright and correct.
A life apart—
entering and exiting, soaring through emerald clouds.

**To Fan Mingshu, Who Bestowed a Fan**
□silk woven into a fan,
fit for the idle to perpetually do good.
Startling the mention of mosquitoes and flies,
gently fanning to spare lives.
Enhancing quiet elegance,
aiding carefree wandering, untouched by dust.
Brushing away entanglements,
the mind is clear, the heart pure, the nature-moon full.

**To Yu Tuan and Yu Ji, Who First Requested**
Master Yu, heed my advice—
worldly affairs are boundless, hard to traverse fully.
Better to recognize the subtle mystery,
gradually understand emptiness and grasp the wondrous mechanism.
Cast aside family ties,
roam as clouds and water, cultivate the great Dao.
One day, when merit is complete,
ride a crane, carry clouds, and ascend to Jade Capital.

**Admonishing Liu Wen of Mouping County**
Liu Wen of Mouping County wished to immolate himself—
I hastily composed this lyric to save his life.
Master Liu, heed my advice—
learning Buddhism or cultivating immortality depends on insight.
Sever the dust from the heart,
not through burning or discarding the body.
A little refinement,
forging the spirit elixir requires nine revolutions.
When merit and conduct are complete,
follow the lineage of Patriarch Liu, the Sea Toad.

**To Master Jiang, Who Bestowed Used Paper**
□transmitting the decree,
□below, pure chanting—grateful for the paper.
□silk delayed,
□brush writes letters, hoe seen before.

*Breaking the Character "Stroke" to Begin*

**Remembering an Old Friend to the Tune *Taoyuan Yiguren***
Master Chongyang led us to ascend Penglai Pavilion.
Immortal Feng and I feast at Penglai,
delighting in Penglai’s clarity and shallowness.
The mirage of Penglai appears,
tigers roar in Penglai’s gardens.
Dragons chant, coiling around Penglai’s halls,
crane chariots and Penglai’s phoenix carriages.
The elixir, revealed through Penglai’s nine revolutions,
worthy to meet Penglai’s selection.

**Another**
Kun Jian Mountain near Penglai’s outskirts,
connected to Penglai’s cloud feet.
Wondrous scenes of Penglai gleam,
rosy clouds transform Penglai’s cranes.
Golden winds blow, turning Penglai’s pavilion—
naturally, Penglai’s elixir is present.

**The Immortal’s True Joy at Penglai**
The immortal’s true joy at Penglai—
not in vain the Penglai vow.

**Another**
Ma Feng, by chance, took up the Daoist path,
no envy for mortal wealth and rank.
He built a walled abode,
shielding from wind, frost, and rain.
By day and night, he mended the numinous light—
one day, his work complete, he shall depart.
To dwell in Penglai’s grotto-palace,
serving our Master.

**Sent to Three Daoist Friends: Tan, Liu, and Hao #2**
Tan Feng, Liu, and Hao—cloud and mist friends,
carefree, wandering at ease.
When the mood wanes, best return to Shaanxi’s west,
to speak of the *wu* within *you*.
Ever pure, ever still, ever free from leakage—
then tiger and dragon unite in embrace.
Within this, no divine yet divine splendor,
but the draught of immortality’s wine.

**On Meeting Ma Feng**
Ma Feng, once a rich man’s son—
why cast off wife and child?
Now a drifting, impoverished soul,
until he met Master Chongyang.
From then, styled "Master Danyang,"
worldly affairs vanished without trace.
Awakened to the truth of man’s birth—
he shall surely become an immortal.

**Self-Realization**
Father and elder brothers passed before their time—
no need for divination henceforth.
Surely the wheel turns to me next—
how to escape birth and death?
Awakened, I become a fleeting shadow,
let others guess and shatter their hearts.
Recognize the true *somewhat* within—
then share in the clouds’ embrace.

**Thinking of Gao of Liaoyang’s Great Talent**
*To the Tune "Remembering an Old Friend at Taoyuan"*
Since parting, I often dwell in restless longing.
Where now does his official journey lead?
He has forgotten our first meeting.
I now cultivate beyond the world—
only wishing he might awaken.
Fiercely abandon glory, wealth, and rank,
to join the cloud and mist companions.

**To the Kong Brothers of Kong Hermitage**
Four brothers, Kong—
the two youngest have passed.
No need for divination hereafter—
just recall them and shed tears.
Birth, death—how to avoid?
Best fiercely cast off worldly ties,
cultivate beyond the world, accumulate merit,
and surely attain the immortal’s rank.

**Exhorting Li the Ritual Master of the Three Altars in Chang’an**
Master Li, Keeper of the Observances, heed my counsel—
this alone is not yet the ultimate ease.
Awaken to the clarity of water and cloud,
the profound mystery of the heart made manifest.
The Wooden Man’s skill is no ordinary arrow—
use the Three Vehicles to rescue and aid.
Pierce through the palace within—
then behold the Tathāgata’s face.

**The Recluse of Taoyuan Asks of the Dao**
The recluse of Taoyuan came especially,
asking of some subtle mystery.
I spoke of the inversion of *kan* and *li*,
water and fire sharing the same furnace.
Tiger and dragon coil to form the elixir-treasure,
five-colored auspicious clouds parting the way.
They guide forth the embryonic immortal, untouched by age,
to dwell on Penglai’s isle.

**Master Wutai Yue Comes to Share Tea**
Master Wutai Yue, master of the Three Essentials,
has expelled the Three Pengs.
Wielding the Three Carts, radiant and bright,
they bear the Three Vehicles’ wonders.
The Three Assemblies at Dragon Flower—his heart now clear,
suddenly the Three Lights shine as one.
Within, the Three Altars’ rites are set—
he himself has attained the Three Purities.

**To Master Cai and His Wife (Three-Character Stanza)**
□□Husband and wife, heed my judgment:
□□Best to relinquish □□.
□□Let sons be—no need to manage,
□□for soon they shall be severed.
□□Entanglements of love, unshackled,
□□gradually refined by fire.
□□Bright, luminous, and resplendent,
□□the mountain rustic calls.

**Another**
Mandarin ducks, not yet old, but hair already white—
what karmic cause is so hard to fathom?
Speak the truth, and naturally you shall understand:
all for clinging to lust and delusion.
If one awakens and suddenly flees to rivers and mountains,
devoted to cultivating virtue beyond the world—
the pure and still Daoist dharma—
then dwell in Penglai’s abode.

**To Elder Master Yao**
First in cultivation, cast off worldly ties,
do not follow worldly chatter.
Beware of climbing high then neglecting the low,
do not cling to the slightest pretense.
Restrain the heart’s monkey and the mind’s horse,
truly still, truly pure, serene and refined.
When spirit and qi harmonize, awake and free—
merit complete, the elixir priceless.

**To Master He, Bound for the Isles, with a Bamboo Staff**
A Daoist gift, presenting the profound—
naturally, a zither rests upon the knee.
Its sound pierces the nine heavens’ mystery,
drawing the green luan to dance.
Fill the cup with flowing rosy clouds—do not refuse—
take the nine-jointed numinous branch.
It shall aid your steps from the very beginning,
straight to Penglai’s path.

**To Zhao Gongchuo Before the Palace Examination**
Today, the transmission of cultivation’s practice—
externally, refine the ten thousand entanglements.
Refined once, best refine again,
what need to refine if you’ve seen through?
Only then, within, leisurely refine—
the Six Bandits and Three Corpses, repeatedly refined.
Mirror extinguished, heart forgotten, the elixir refined—
then truly refine into reality.

**Another Chant**
Man is bound by the ten thousand entanglements—
if you can see through them,
and further recognize them,
then cultivation can be accomplished.

**To Zhang the Keeper of the Lianzhu Abbey**
At the Zhenyang Town’s Cinnabar Cloud Abbey,
Abbot Zhang’s skillful hands.
Section by section, the Cinnabar Field tended,
ever bright and resplendent.
Within, the inner landscape truly worth beholding—
seeing through nature’s rootless chaos.
The Dao blesses your long life—
may you gain immortals as companions.

**To the Two Masters Liu of Ancient Times**
Your destiny holds a share in immortal cultivation—
why vie for profit, contend for fame, and suffer a rebuke?
Restraining desire, defying emotion, sorrow and vexation—
compelled to turn back swiftly.
Counting up, what’s the use of fleeting splendor?
Better to preserve your nature and life.
Directly recognize the *wuwei* purity—
then surely attain immortality.

**To Registrar Wang Yanwen**
Your destiny holds a share in the immortal’s covenant—
beyond that, hard to seek fame and profit.
What you arrange cannot be as you wish—
this spurs the resolve to cultivate.
Counting up, no one can replace you in birth and death—
how could you burden yourself with worldly ties?
To claim the immortal’s seat on the Ten Isles—
pile up pure and still merit.

**To Officer Li the Fourth**
Leisurely reflecting on past and present, those who turn back—
their right and wrong, merits and fame achieved.
Yet often, affairs do not go as wished—
suddenly awakened, they seek a way to return.
Transcending the world, brushing aside worldly burdens,
cultivating merit beyond the world.
Winning the joy of sages and worthies—
Peng Island awaits your place.

**To Master Zheng**
If you intend to enter the Dao, first turn back—
how much more so, now in your sixty-ninth year?
Life and destiny should be saved early—
do not wait until the body withers.
Guard the *wuwei* purity and stillness—
naturally, the divine elixir shall be without leakage.

The heavens and earth may endure forever—
ever be companions of cloud and mist.

**To the Many Daoist Friends at Tingchuan**
In the dust, each grasps for fame and profit,
vying to outshine Shi Chong’s wealth.
Yet how can one evade what fate forbids?
Even so, escape is hard.
Awakened, feigning haste—
this is the wondrous plan to leave the household.
Refine *qi*, perfect spirit in full,
then take your place on Penglai’s isles.

**To Master Dong: Linked-Pearl Couplet**
[Pre]pare to receive what must be recognized—
[recog]nize the root-source’s purity.
[Pure] intent, clear mind, expel illusions—
[illus]ions vanish, the mind forgets all.
[All] forms uphold the Eight Precepts rightly—
[right]ly aligned with the luminous mind-seal.
[Seal] fastens radiant *chan* stillness—
[still]ness is the sure path of immortals.

**To Master Dong**
□ west of the spring, cloud-companion Dong,
□ sought the Jade Cave of Fufeng.
□ spoke of true lead, true mercury—
□ how to tend the fire?
□ all pure and still merit resides—
□ ants bore through nine-holed pearls.
□ noon’s inversion forges the vast—
□ true nature is worthy of honor.

*(Breaking the character "龙" to begin.)*

**To the Great Master Hua Shi Xian**
□□ immortal elder, true *chan* elder,
□□ sweeping away ten thousand entanglements.
□□ humbling the heart is most wondrous—
□□ suddenly, all is understood.
□□ the three treasures: spirit, *qi*, essence—
□□ idly tending the furnace and hearth.
□□ the elixir’s early completion startles—
□□ true suchness is fine.

**Parting Gift to the Daoist Assembly at the Yellow Register Retreat**
Seeking sound to save the suffering, fulfilling my vow—
my heart reaches the ends of sea and sky.
Secretly guiding people from the fiery household,
truly cultivating beyond the world.
Reflecting on hell, the heart shudders—
reciting scriptures to deliver departed souls.
Shackles naturally fall away,
all ascending to Penglai’s feast.

**To My Disciple Yunfu, Who Wrote Regarding Funeral Matters: A Poetic Reply**
In life, already a mistake for what comes next—
in death, the body’s ugliness.
Best to avoid the vast expanse of the Three Lights;
bury it and leave it be.
Descendants perform filial rites like matchmakers—
exhuming and reburial are but jest.
Bones together in a shared coffin,
displaying greed for fleeting joy.

**Again**
Awakened, suddenly realizing past errors—
how dare one harbor evil thoughts?
Turning the wheel of Penglai’s silver expanse,
within, as if lifting and arranging.
From nothingness, the infant and maiden rely on a matchmaker—
indeed, the Yellow Dame’s jest.
Harmonizing, emerging from the jade coffin,
in heaven, eternal bliss.

**The Dao of Heaven Is Impartial (Originally Titled "Licorice Root")**
**Exhorting the Many Daoist Friends**
Only now, recalling Zhuang Zhou—
a butterfly’s dream, light as powder.
Thoroughly awakened to the truth of no ties,
the Dao of Heaven alone is trustworthy.
Single-mindedly, urgently cultivate in solitude—
do not cling to this borrowed, delicate frame.
Abandon household ties at once,
forsaking love and resentment between man and wife.

**Exhorting Master Dong, Daoist Friend #3**
I urge you—
though cultivation is hard to sustain,
there is the clearest of rains.
Rain turns to flying snow,
revealing the green lotus shore.
Accompanying companions who transcend the dust, cloud and mist—
do not stir the mind of clinging.
Do not love the golden cage and parrot—
hear the true words of the horse and wind.

**Transmitting the Wondrous Dao (Originally Titled "Transmitting the Northern Branch")**
**To the Tune of "Feeding the Willows"**
The mountain rustic plucks rightly,
the heart’s zither in immortal tune.
Suddenly recalling—
the Dao’s bond with the fragrant-named Zhao.
I wish for you, sir, to awaken early—
all affairs are upside-down.
Hide wisdom, feign ignorance—
away with cunning and cleverness!
Then emulate
Xu’s and Pang’s households,
wholly beyond the world,
each and every one fully enlightened.

**Again**
Pure heart, still intent,
penetrating *chan*, illuminating the Dao.

**To the Tune of "Carefree Joy"**
Carefree joy—forever without sorrow or vexation.
Sing wildly if you will,
let the petty men below hear and laugh aloud.
Let them laugh—
how would they know
the inner beauty is too fine?
Wait for the day when merit is complete and the work fulfilled—
then surely the purple writ will arrive.

**To the Tune of "Filling the Courtyard with Fragrance"**
*Deluded Chess*
Words slip glibly from the mouth,
hands point recklessly at the board,
while dark hearts harbor cunning and deceit.
Only scheming for self-gain,
letting others perish as they may.
The silent joy of victory—
laughing at those who mourn without tears.
No compassion,
a murderous heart plundering,
ever bent on perversity.

By chance,
a master’s awakening touch—
turn the heart to goodness,
enter the Dao and follow it long.
Then penetrate mystery, know the white,
guard the black, leave the homeland.
Cut off thought, forget cunning, nurture vastness,
refine the elixir of spirit—
born of Chongyang’s lineage.
Go forth to teach and transform,
expound the subtle and wondrous—
poems and songs fill the courtyard with fragrance.

**Lamenting Fame and Profit**
Profit lures the mind-monkey,
fame tugs the intent-horse,
rushing day and night without cease.
Wave after wave, kalpa after kalpa,
coming and going without end.
Ever gluttonous, ever ravenous,
the heart toils, the body suffers, the spirit wearies.
Cease this delusion—
in a single mouth,
how many spoons can you fit?

Pitiable,
these illusory affairs:
wife and sons, mere walking bones,
oneself a moving corpse.
Why cling to love,
to attachment, to following?
Best to evade the wheel of rebirth,
early seek *chan*, visit the Dao, find a master.
The discourse of long life—
there is subtle wonder in it,
truly the ladder to heaven.

**Breaking Free from the Cage: A Gift to Magistrate Liu of Jingzhao**
Snap the reins of fame,
strike open the lock of profit,
joyfully leap from the cage.
Unfettered, unbound,
stroll east or west as you please.
A life of carefree ease,
embracing non-action,
the pure and still family way.
No clinging thoughts,
no love for the monastic—
wherever you go, harmony prevails.

Not only
is the body at ease,
the heart vast and open,
the nature clear and bright.
No need to seek the infant and maiden,
the Kan tiger or Li dragon.
The square inch of the mind—
stilled, limpid, profoundly serene,
attaining the natural harmony of spirit and qi.
The affairs of immortals—
what cause for doubt?
You will surely ascend to Peng Palace.

**Chant of Reunion**
Reuniting with the wind immortal,
deeper awakening,
the heart wholly given to feigned foolishness.
The beard bristles with vigor,
yet the mouth stays shut, silent.
Done with lofty discourse and grand debates,
the brush and inkstone set aside,
no more expounding of scriptures.
From now on,
a solitary cloud, a wild crane,
feeding like a fledgling, clad in tattered robes.

When cold comes,
seek paper and cloth;
when joy arrives,
sing and dance.
Hungry, scavenge scraps—
like an untethered boat,
what course or destination?
Carefree, at ease, unburdened,
no attachments, no stains, no constraints.
If someone asks,
look to my way of life—
why question me further?

**To Madame Zhao, the Pengying Immortal**
In the city of Jingzhao,
on Zhangtai Street,
lived the wealthy Madame Yang.
She built a Daoist abode,
a home for her son, free from worldly dust.
Living in carefree joy,
she wore clouds like a cloak,
passionately fond of purity and emptiness.
Her hidden virtue accumulated—
pitying the poor, loving the aged,
setting up prisons and offering sacrifices for the lonely dead.

Around the walls,
ten halls were built,
clothing and food provided alone,
kitchens set up in three places.
Her long life and years
were sustained by the power of the Dao.
On the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month,
she was born no different from an immortal.
With merit and conduct piled high,
she will surely one day
mount a crane and ascend to the immortal capital.

**Awakening, Awakening, Awakening**
The Dao’s law grows ever loftier,
the teachings vast and boundless,
stretching east, west, south, and north without limit.
Opening the mysterious path,
clearing the straight road without bias.
Walking in carefree ease,
worldly affairs must not entangle.
Illuminating the three awakenings,
spirit and qi surge,
pure and still, transmitted in succession.

Naturally,
creation is accomplished—
wood and metal separated,
water and fire flowing.
The tiger and dragon unite,
the infant and maiden steadfast.
The great medicine of the true golden elixir forms,
within silver clouds,
radiant and resplendent.
The momentum of ascent—
coming and going, entering and exiting,
beckoning the immortals of the Great Canopy.

**Escaping the Sea of Suffering: A Gift to Official Zhang the Second**
People rejoice at the birth of a son,
who knows he will steal your spirit?
Bound to his heart and will,
fearing he won’t grow to manhood.
When he’s raised, where does your care go?
Cherishing wife and sons,
forgetting his kindness.
Do not grieve—
while the body is strong and healthy,
seek another good cause.

Joyfully,
escape the sea of suffering,
cut off love, sever attachment,
forget thoughts, abandon dust.
Visit cloud companions and mist friends,
moonlit neighbors and windy kin.
Discuss the long life of enduring vision,
penetrate the wondrous mystery,
root deeply and firmly.
The golden elixir forms,
merit complete, conduct fulfilled—
mount a crane and go to pay homage to the true.

**On Gold and Jade**
The jade cave, profound and dark,
the golden furnace, radiant and bright—
within purity, gold and jade are rare.
The golden dragon, the jade tiger,
jade runs, gold flies.
Crashing through the golden gate and jade door,
golden lotuses and jade buds vie in splendor.
How fine are gold and jade—
heavenly winds sway them,
jade leaves and golden branches.

Clinking,
gold and jade—
the golden infant, the jade maiden,
jade steps, the golden chamber.
Revealing golden light and jade brilliance,
jade countenance and golden robes.
This numinous gold, this numinous jade,
forming the golden elixir,
the jade nature unharmed.
True gold and jade,
refined into the mysterious treasure—
known only to the original master.

**Abiding in the Natural**
Pure and still true work,
the great Dao of non-action—
naturally, the body and function awaken.
The numinous essence of prior heaven,
originally within my breast.
North, south, east, west meet,
the eye of wisdom opens—
what need for dimness or blur?
Within the gourd’s scene,
water births the jade tiger,
fire nurtures the golden dragon.

Auspicious light
spreads through the universe—
the three fields bloom with elixir,
the eight vessels divine and free.
Donning straw cloak and bamboo hat,
like a fisherman.
Expounding the profound and wondrous delight,
urging all to nurture harmonious qi.
Together we cultivate,
merit complete, conduct fulfilled—
following one another to the immortal palace.

**Inscribed at the Pavilion of Ice and Snow: For Yanzi’s Rites**
Auspicious mist floats,
propitious vapors rise gently—
parting the curtain, the white night’s subtle glow.
Pure, lofty, and pristine,
like a thick layer of frost.
Just like the inner vision of the mountain rustic—
jade flowers bloom,
jade buds exude fragrance.

Jade essences coalesce,
their treasured radiance outshining jade tablets—
linked as a city’s rarest gem.
Why seek musk or amber?
Naturally fragrant and rich,
beyond the common.
Behold the silver toad spilling brilliance,
turning the square and round in its course.
The Perfected One of Guye roams freely,
playing with the wind, jade pendants chiming.
The fetal immortal appears
deep in the white clouds,
drinking celestial nectar at will.

*Composed for the Grand Offering at Laizhou’s Yellow Register*

Oral transmission passes on,
truths mutually sustaining,
awakening to a mind in harmony.
Within the profound, wondrous delight—
the bright moon answers the clear wind.
Master Ancestor Zhongli transmitted to Lü,
Lü transmitted to Lord Wang,
Lord Wang perfected it,
secretly passing it to Ma Yu,
true conduct aiding true attainment.

In Pengcheng, with fellow Daoists,
I was invited to perform rites of deliverance,
several times along the journey.
Together with the Military Commissioner
and his deputy, we were received.
Kneeling to receive the honored official’s decree,
the empowerment bestowed in the Purple Ultimate Palace.
The departed soul’s blessing—
ascending to the celestial realm,
profound and lofty the Dao.

**The Knife-Point Method**
Sun and moon conjoin in the palace,
tiger and dragon dwell as one,
no division of south or north, east or west.
The quintessence of the five directions
gathers and coalesces into the knife-point.
Within the twelve hours, refine it—
at the sharp tip, light streams forth.
Worthy to grasp,
in walking, standing, sitting, lying,
freely wielding it upside-down.

Add steel, sharpen the blade,
sever the six thieves,
dispel the three corpses.
Then, brandishing it to and fro,
cleave through delusion.
Who would believe the wondrous use within nothingness?
Transforming into a wakeful, carefree infant.
The principle of cultivating truth—
transmitted by the master,
passed on to fellow practitioners.

**Matching Rhymes with Zhang Feiqing’s Palace Examination Verse**
Seven times to the imperial capital,
thrice through the palace examination—
how could one know the ceaseless refinement of qi?
The heart-monkey rests,
the mind-horse ceases its wild leaps.
In joyful ease like the swallows,
relying on purity to secure the spirit’s source.
In the profoundest realm,
the three luminaries shine together,
illuminating the cavern-heaven.

I urge you, awaken—
cease chasing talent and brilliance,
hear my words.
There is a wondrous path of freedom,
beyond words, beyond transmission.
With resolute decisiveness, a single blade cuts two—
severing entanglements, naturally penetrating the profound.
True attainment achieved,
the descendants of the Marquis of Liu
follow in succession to become immortals.

**In Praise of Perfected Lord Chongyang’s Manifestations**
The compassionate Perfected One,
Master Chongyang,
pervades all things with understanding.
His return date foretold,
his words like the wind of the heart.
As predicted, he journeyed to Nanjing,
ascending in rosy clouds—
instructing Master Zang afterward.
When Master Chongyang ascended in rosy clouds,
by dusk, Master Zang in Nanjing encountered him,
still unaware of his ascension, thinking him alive.
Only later did he realize—
so swift was it.

In Qiyang Town,
his crown towering above the mortal realm,
he transmitted his teachings to me once more.

In Huating, west of the city,
he appeared to save me from suffering,
his qi spreading through my body.
Atop the clouds of Wendeng,
his compassionate visage manifested.
The county magistrate, Ni Lihu, saw him—
in but a moment, he returned to the heavenly palace.
A true event, rare in ancient and modern times,
naturally worthy of reverence.

**The Padded Jacket Bestowed by the Four Elders of Tui Jiang**
A full cycle round the walls,
for years barefoot, snarling at the cold like a prisoner.
Yet with transcendent resolve,
I vowed to complete the work of cultivation.
Moved, immortals descended to the mortal realm,
pouring qi into my body like a flowing stream.
Unobstructed, harmonious above and below,
a fine cause and effect in perfect accord.

In Guanzhong, my credentials dispatched,
I journeyed far to the eastern lands,
indulging in reckless desires.
Committing errors as vast as the heavens,
how dared I accept fine robes?
Wrapping myself like a grain silo,
I invited blame and reproach—
my illness could not be cured.
Returning the padded jacket,
carefree and unburdened,
in tattered robes I displayed true cultivation.

**Lament for the Benevolent Fool**
In the mirror, a face grown sallow,
amidst the comb, hair turned white—
still he gallops in pursuit of talent and ambition.
Unconcerned for himself,
he frets for his children and grandchildren.
Day by day, vying for fame and profit,
hour by hour, scheming and plotting.
How laughable—
such a foolish man,
who will not cease until death.

People, heed my counsel:
the urgency of impermanence,
the fragility of life.
I urge you all to awaken,
to turn back with generosity.
Do not say Penglai’s path is distant—
with an enlightened heart,
the immortal isles lie but a footstep away.
Truly pure and still,
with virtue complete in non-action,
you shall join the ranks of immortals.

**A Smile in the Heart**
I laugh at myself—
pursuing the Dao, cultivating immortality,
accumulating merit and conduct,
ever fearful of falling short.
Exhorting others to do good
is most fitting for the Way.
Yet even slight uprightness
soon invites suspicion and doubt.
I laugh in my heart—
seeking merit in others,
how can one avoid right and wrong?

**On Hermit Chen of Mount Hua**
Hermit Chen of Mount Hua,
neither plowing nor weaving,
seldom descending the mountain.
Yet some still slander him,
sighing as they compose poems.
Upright, selfless, and without deceit,
he endures honor and disgrace, fortune and peril.
Living freely,
carefree and unconstrained,
he sings and dances in joyous tranquility.

**Golden Jade Hermitage of Huang County**
East of the temple, west of the city,
south of the mountains, north of the sea—
a heart that forms good affinities.
The hermitage named Golden Jade,
the hall built as the Hall of Complete Perfection.
In the corridors, the clear wind and bright moon;
in the garden, no leaks—
no fall into the depths of suffering.
At the gate, purity and stillness,
cloud companions and rosy friends,
dwelling in contentment and ease.

In non-action, within the walled enclosure,
slender pines and sparse bamboo,
newly planted and fresh.
Atop the precious flower terrace,
wondrous events astonish.
Gazing toward the islands of Penglai,
why seek elsewhere for eternal spring?
Worthy of painting—
a realm of magic mushrooms,
Ma Yu briefly unfolds.

**Attaining the Fruit of Immortality**
The mysterious pass of the feminine locked,
dragons racing, tigers running,
gently regulating the breath in unbroken continuity.
The clear wind enters through the door,
restraining the madness of horses and monkeys.
The maiden and infant meet,
discussing purity and stillness—
the most wondrous root of the source.
Without contrivance,
naturally attaining the Dao,
ascending to the Great Heaven of Tai Luo.

**Foolish Son, Earnestly I Entreat**
Parents of the ten directions,
hear your child’s words.
May the tea houses and taverns
pass these words along in turn.
Do not dismiss them as fox speech or badger words—
they are true, secret, and profound.
Rely on this practice,
and each person has a share,
each may become an immortal.

**To Lord Tangkuo’s Son Who Left Home**
Braving snow to ride the carriage,
facing the wind to seek the Dao,
you came especially to inquire of me.
Speaking of cultivation and nurturing,
no mention of tigers or dragons.
What need to discuss the infant and maiden,
the union of tortoise and snake,
the palaces of sun and moon?
No water or fire,
no swallowing or gargling,
no timed practices.

Truly, the wondrous function—
a livelihood of non-action,
a family tradition of purity and stillness.
Tame the monkey of the mind and the horse of intention,
do not let them run wild.
Refine the breath in unbroken continuity,
naturally achieving harmony between mother and child.
Preserving life and nature,
a purple summons arrives—
straight to the Great Heavenly Palace of Tai Luo.

**On Not Paying Visits**
I do not visit lords and nobles,
nor do I shun the poor and lowly,
nor seek wealth, honor, or glory.

No fine delicacies prepared,
nor dare I scorn hempen robes.
No flames of ignorance kindled,
no clinging to circumstances,
nor thoughts of home.
All things set aside—
only the master’s decree not forgotten,
the furnace refining cinnabar to white.

At ease, truly free,
a livelihood of leisure,
a life of clouds and water.
Facing the wind as neighbor, the moon as companion,
brimming with flowing rosy clouds.
Having awakened to long life and enduring vision,
why boast or vie for glory?
In coming and going,
auspicious clouds and瑞 mist
step by step pave the path with lotus.

**The Yaksha Hag**
Powdered face, rouged lips,
penciled brows, patched temples,
sweet words and gentle demeanor.
Cunning hidden within,
she is called the Yaksha Hag.
Beneath a kind face, a treacherous heart,
her slender fingers sharper than eagle’s talons.
Proud of her form,
she steals lives,
by night prowling the web of desire.

When meeting a master,
one awakens at last—
to flee karmic hindrances,
one must shun vengeful demons.
Though wandering waters and clouds,
keep far from her lair.
Hasten to preserve spirit and qi,
accumulate merit and practice—
dare not idle away.
Fulfill the heart’s vow,
urge others to cultivate,
and when merit is complete,
sing the hymn of the Cave Immortal.

**Awakening to Past Errors**
No need for others to inquire—
one must ask oneself:
why scheme for wealth?
Without deceit or guile,
nothing comes naturally.
When the heart stirs with stinginess, greed, or envy,
beware—calamity follows not as disaster but as retribution.
Deceiving heaven and earth,
harboring venom in secret—
how can one not plunge into the abyss?

In the netherworld,
the Mirror of Karma hangs—
no deceit, no jest,
no evasion, no denial.
Better to heed early warnings,
awaken, and let the heart turn to ash.
Beyond the mundane,
keep company with cloud companions,
discussing long life
and escaping the rabbit’s wheel of rebirth.
Cultivate merit and practice,
never forgetting the original vow—
surely one will ascend to Penglai.

**Cherishing Cultivation**
In every matter, rest the heart,
in all affairs, yield to others,
advancing or retreating as needed.
The uncontentious superior person—
softness overcomes hardness.
Wandering carefree through days,
abiding in purity,
achieving perfection in the square and round.
Cherishing cultivation,
the primordial numinous essence
must be concealed within the crucible.

**Unforgetting**
Only the Dao is unforgotten—
as hunger craves rice,
as thirst longs for drink,
like an infant seeking its mother,
single-minded in thought.
Hasten to save one’s own nature,
regulate the true breath—
do not rush.
Ever subtly,
in unbroken continuity,
when merit is complete,
ascend to Pengzhuang.

**Awakening to Life and Death**
Seventy years of fleeting splendor,
a moment’s passing scene—
pondering, one sighs.
Sour bitterness stings the nose,
painful matters crowd the heart.
Life and death—
but two words,
yet since birth,
death’s shadow looms.
To nurture qi,
one must escape life and death,
seeking beyond the mundane.

When the heart opens,
the wondrous function flows—
wood nurtured in fire,
gold born in water.
Gathering the marrow of heaven and earth,
draw it into the cinnabar forest.
Dragon and tiger transform into infant and maiden,
the numinous manifests—
what need to speak of yin and yang?
No birth, no extinction,
truly, clearly,
riding a crane to the jade peak.

**The Puppet’s Lesson**
Providing for the whole household,
greedily seeking livelihood,
the body like a puppet on stage.
Bound by fame and profit,
drawn into the play’s frenzy.
Entangled in a thousand threads,
made to act wildly with a flick of the finger.
Proud of its form,
shaking its head, mimicking shadows,
dashing about to display its beauty.

When meeting a master,
the truth is revealed—
a walking corpse,
a stumbling skeleton.
Like a marionette on strings,
awaiting impermanence.
Hasten to recognize the clouds and waters within the pot,
knock at the mysterious pass,
where fragrant hemp and wheat await.
Dragon coiled, tiger crouched,
mercury and lead refined—
the elixir congeals,
becoming a Penglang immortal.

**Breaking the Meditative Trance**
Enforcing discipline, practicing merit,
sitting by the clock—
yet why remain dull and sluggish?
The sleep demon overturns,
head nodding to the chest.
Snores like thunder,
startled awake—
eyes again grow heavy.
I admonish myself:
with such progress,
how refine tiger and dragon?

**If Unconvinced**
Observe your peers in secret—
surely their hearts are open.
Seeing them sway like boats,
ashamed, one becomes the helmsman.
Better to recognize the great Dao of non-action,
heart pure,
spirit and qi harmonized.
The numinous light congeals,
the Three Elixirs leap forth,
illuminating the Five Brightness Palace.

**Subduing the Heart-Demon**
Familiar realms entangle,
the heart-demon overturns—
in practice, one must subdue the heart.
Whether still or moving,
day and night,
guard the heart’s resolve.
Though the square inch is small,
worldly passions arise—
ten thousand kinds entangle the heart.
See through it:
whether ascending to heaven or descending to earth,
all weakness stems from the heart.

From now on,
awaken—
firmly seize the horse of intention,
tightly lock the monkey of the mind.
Shatter the ordinary heart,
to glimpse the true heart.
Day by day, clarify the heart and dispel desires,
ever and always,
examine body and mind.
Without partiality,
when the heart is upright,
only then does it align with heaven’s heart.

**The Skeleton’s Guise**
A skeleton’s form,
yet still trafficking in bones,
karmic ties coming and going.
Dashing about cleverly,
unwilling to pause, to let the heart turn to ash.
Endlessly shifting,
leaping through past and present,
changing shapes.
Vainly craving longevity,
though enduring ten thousand kalpas,
still bound to the wheel of rebirth.

When meeting a master,
receiving direct instruction—
cultivate a single point,
avoid falling into a thousand abysses.
Cast aside the seven emotions and six desires,
protect the Three Terraces.
Jade tiger and golden dragon converge,
within the blue lotus,
the infant is cradled.
No birth, no extinction—
in the Great Luo Heaven,
an immortal’s seat is prepared.

**Endure, Endure, Endure**
A blade pierces the heart,
a blade thrust into the heart—
recognize this as a good cause.
Subdue ignorance,
bear humiliation without anger.
Recalling Qinghe’s Duke Yi,
who wept as he wrote to reconcile kin—
the uncontentious person,
ever practicing great kindness,
dares not harm the spirit even briefly.

**When Others Suspect**
Like clay molded into form—
facing the knife, remain steadfast;
encountering medicine, stretch forth.
No need to argue right or wrong,
no need to weigh strength or weakness.
Master Chongyang taught me:
dispel the smoke and fire,
awaken from the false to cultivate the real.
Ever endure,
when provoked, do not contend—
truly become an immortal.

**Attaining True Joy**
A carefree wanderer,
a leisurely idler,
truly loathing glory and splendor.

**Fearing the Fiery Household**
Unskilled at tending a family,
I shun the hearth’s entanglements.
A thousand dusty ties swept clean,
I rely on a tranquil heart—
furnace-tending cinnabar.
Beneath pine peaks,
by water’s edge and stone’s embrace,
I send my spirit soaring with rosy clouds.

That single spirit,
ever bright and pure,
roams carefree in serene indifference—
true joy without bound.
If compared to the bright moon,
the moon may be veiled by clouds.
If likened to a lone cloud’s freedom,
wind-tossed and adrift,
how pitiable its plight.
I, by grace, have crossed to the other shore—
no joy surpasses this.

**In Harmony with Ziyang’s Immortal Yuanzi Wei Xindao’s Rhyme**
A life of indolent ease,
a livelihood of blissful sloth,
each thought and impulse steeped in mercy.
Now I refuse
to pluck a leaf only to seek another branch.
Cast aside the pedant’s *zhi-hu-zhe-ye*—
truly recognize the lotus rising from the mire.
In leisure’s embrace,
I press my hand to my heart and ponder:
as if encountering a master physician.

Carefree,
truly at ease,
to attain immortal blessings,
I rely on the heart’s teacher.
My resolve stands firm as mountains,
unyielding to wayward shifts.
In daily practice, non-action and purity—
naturally, I grasp the East and West.
Some mystery,
once awakened, becomes clear—
though old, it is not too late.

**Returning to the Previous Rhyme**
Those who mourn the dead,
those who send off the departed,
should ponder the fox’s grief at the hare’s death.
Youth fades with spring’s passing—
cease clinging to blossoming boughs.
Gather your spirit,
cross to the other shore,
rise from the mire like water.
Turn toward true awakening,
for the heart is ailing—
seek the physician beyond the world.

The true physician
prescribes no medicine,
but splits the dark and chisels the dim—
this is the enlightened master.
Let the heart remain unstained,
familiar realms shift and change.
With spirit pure, tiger and dragon unite—
whether the red sun rises in the East or sets in the West,
free from sorrow,
on the road to Chang’an,
the Way is walked without delay.

**Departing the Multitude: Instructions to Disciples**
All speak of smoke dispersing,
of fire extinguished,
yet at the slightest touch, ignorance stirs.
Unaware, unknowing—
how can one depart the multitude?
The Dao is fundamentally easy to practice, easy to understand,
but the heart resists—
hard to grasp, hard to follow.
The demon of the heart obstructs,
great virtue unformed,
the square inch of the mind cannot attain clarity.

Go with the flow,
heed these instructions:
let go of right and wrong,
of self and others.
Alas, the walking corpses of bone—
what shame? What glory?
Hasten to save your own nature,
harmonize qi and spirit,
refine and solidify the true form.
In the numinous words,
the jade terrace and Penglai’s gardens—
the Isles of the Blessed lie ahead.

**In Praise of Master Liu of Hunyuan’s Ascension**
Young, he followed the crowd;
grown, he stood apart—
devoted to the registers of the Dao.
He inscribed talismans, chanted over water,
healed the sick, and rescued the imperiled.
His virtue, though hidden like a thief’s,
scorned splendor—
oyster-shell food and coarse robes.
He once encountered
Master Chongyang,
who transmitted to him the gateway to profound stillness.

Knowing
his merit and conduct complete,
he hastened to visit me,
setting the date of his return.
With a flick of his sleeve,
he departed at the appointed time.
In Pengcheng, all was settled—
Ma, swift as the wind,
composed a new verse.
Attaining longevity,
he ascended with the cloud-borne immortals,
riding a crane to the Jasper Pool.

**In Praise of True Man Chongyang’s Manifestation**
In the ancient prefecture of Dengzhou,
beyond the Gate of Immortals,
painted bridges and carriages could not pass.
Master Chongyang,
before the multitude, revealed his true nature.
He foretold that after twelve years,
Prefect He would meet his end.
Finding the path treacherous,
the people dismantled it,
commanding craftsmen to rebuild.

In Wendeng,
he appeared again—
upon a white turtle and lotus,
seated in empty space.
Magistrate Ni Manghu
beheld his true form.
Suddenly, he turned, reclining on his side—
auspicious clouds stirred,
and he returned to the immortal palace.
People vied to paint his likeness,
enshrining it in every home,
revered and honored everywhere.

**Again**
The Wondrous Practitioner,
Master Chongyang,
met his teacher, the Perfected Lü.
After ten years of perfecting the Dao,
he departed, riding the wind.
For twelve years, he descended thrice to the world,
his nature upright,
all affairs guided by impartiality.
In heaven, he manifested
the art of non-action,
surpassing and revealing the work of spontaneity.

In the *Complete Perfection* canon,
hidden within its depths,
mystery resides.
Discuss the dragon’s roar, the tiger’s howl,
the tender beauty of the infant and maiden.
Within the jade, golden light gleams—
the elixir congeals,
leaping forth from the numinous palace.
Let people awaken,
hasten to cultivate purity—
do not endure the world’s veneration.

**To Elders Xin the Fifth and Jiang the Fourth**
Surpassing wealth and distinction,
their conduct set them apart—
Jiang Jian and Xin Tong of Laiyang.
In Wendeng, they attended the jiao rites,
undaunted by frost and wind.
Traveling nearly a thousand li,
they sought the altar,
presenting their petition to Ma Yu and Jiang Gong.
Upholding filial piety,
the magistrate, hearing of this,
rewarded their extraordinary merit with fine wine.

Sincere and devout,
their prayers met with response—
as the jiao rites concluded,
an immortal appeared amidst the clouds.
They summoned a master painter
to capture his wondrous visage.
From then on, in motion and stillness,
they turned the wheel,
navigating the palace of yin and yang.
Forsaking worldly affairs,
their fellow villagers admired and revered them,
holding them in ever higher esteem.

**To the Leaders of the Laiyang County Jiao Ritual**
Zhong Zhen of Gaomi,
Jiang Jian of Laiyang,
and Xin Shi, known for restoring temples.
They invited me to perform the rites,
undaunted by snow and wind.
Presenting the official documents,
they knelt to receive them—
complying with the wishes of the assembled lords.

Amidst bare walls they dwelt,
a single meal of thin gruel sufficed—
yet they mustered full and perfect effort.
Through empowerment, not carelessly,
they trampled the jade mountains to dust,
nurturing the golden treasury within.
They sought the coupling of tiger and dragon,
to birth the primal visage,
to gather and refine their spirit,
awakening and cleansing—
that all lost souls might be delivered,
ascending together to Penglai’s palace.
Let all heed this counsel,
unite in joyful goodness,
for Daoist and Buddhist alike are revered.

**Attending the Great Jiao Ritual at Huanglu, Dengzhou**
Before Pine-Cypress Crag,
within Mist-and-Cloud Grotto,
the pure breeze stirred the sacred sprouts.
Water ascends, fire descends—
the great elixir refines itself.
Songs and dances accompany the young,
while fame and profit are cast aside,
yielding not even to fisherman or woodcutter.
They forget self and other,
finding joy in pure poverty,
for what they fear most is the clamor of the dusty world.

When people come,
seeking deliverance for the departed,
with a thousand words, ten thousand pleas,
earnestly entreating—
they but strengthen their fasting and abstinence,
bowing from afar toward the cloud chambers.
They pray to Master Chongyang,
that lost souls may be saved,
ascending to the azure heavens.
Led by phoenix and crane,
orphaned spirits and lingering shades
follow together in carefree wandering.

**The Seven Treasures Assembly at Wenshan Establishes a Hermitage—Inscribed Reasons for Registration**
Within the Seven Treasures Hermitage,
behind the Three Clarities’ gate,
the Hall of Complete Perfection stands fittingly.
East and west verandas,
well-suited to serve as cloud chambers.

A stone is hewn to form the Elixir Well,
its waters sweet and fine,
like nectar divine.
In this most profound abode,
cultivating truth within secluded walls,
refined and serene beyond compare.

Cloud companions,
and rosy dawn friends,
in subtle discourse engage,
weighing mysteries with care.
When body and mind are pure and still,
this is the immortal’s way.

Regulate the breath as the tortoise does,
the lamp of life within,
the moon of nature round and bright.
In the ritual arena,
Daoist companions of Wenshan,
sing this *"Full Court of Fragrance."*
