**The Precious Key of Golden Pass and Jade Lock by the True Person of Double Ninth**
*Composed by Zhongyangzi Wang Zhuangzhe of Zhongnan Mountain*

Someone asked: *"What is the wondrous principle of cultivating the True?"*
The answer was: *"First, eliminate nameless afflictions; second, abstain from clinging to wine, sex, wealth, and qi. This is the method of cultivation."*

The human body contains the principles of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth nourish all things, and all things fill the space between Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth’s sublime vastness are never obscured by them. Those who cultivate should embody this in all affairs.

**Objection:** *"Heaven has darkness, Earth has tremors, mountains collapse, seas dry up, and the sun and moon wax and wane. Moreover, humans fall ill and face impermanence—how does one rectify this?"*
**Answer:** *"To rectify this, one must attain the Supreme Way’s method of refining the Five Phases."*

**Question:** *"What is the method of the Five Phases?"*
**Key:** *"First, one must uphold precepts—purity, stillness, endurance, compassion, and genuine goodness—cutting off the Ten Evils, practicing expedient means to rescue all beings, loyalty to the sovereign, and filial piety toward parents and teachers. This is the way of cultivation. Then, one practices true function."*

**Key:** *"Within the body, east and west must recognize Geng, Jia, Mao, and You. South and north must recognize Kan and Li, lead and mercury."*

**Key:** *"Geng, Jia, Mao, and You correspond to day and night. Jia and Mao are the qi of the liver. In the eight nodes, at the Spring Equinox and Vernal Equinox, the mouth produces saliva. Geng and You are the qi of the lungs. In the eight nodes, at the Autumn Equinox and Autumnal Equinox, the mouth produces fluids. Kan and Li are cold and heat. Li and lead are the central qi of the body. In the eight nodes, at the Summer Solstice and Summer Equinox, the body contains blood. Kan and mercury are the qi of the kidneys. In the eight nodes, at the Winter Solstice and Winter Equinox, the body contains essence. Essence generates the soul, blood generates the spirit. Essence is nature, blood is life. Those who comprehend nature and life have attained true cultivation."*

**Key:** *"Essence and blood are the roots of the physical form. True qi is the root of nature and life. Thus, where there is blood, true qi can be generated. When true qi is robust, the body naturally endures long, and essence and blood coalesce into form."*

**Question:** *"Since all are human, why do some die before others?"*
**Answer:** *"Those who die first are those whose hearts cling to desires and pleasures, lusting after sensory realms. Men deplete essence, women deplete blood. Those who do not sever nameless afflictions by day and do not slay the Three Corpses and Yin Ghosts by night—men and women alike—already face impermanence."*

**Question:** *"What of those who do not die?"*
**Answer:** *"Those who do not die are those whose bodies are pure and untainted, who preserve true qi in the elixir field, whose essence and blood do not wane."*

**Objection:** *"Many see people who practice purity and abandon wives yet fail to attain the Way—why?"*
**Answer:** *"Though such people may be outwardly pure, they do not grasp the true function of purity. Though their bodies are still, they cannot stabilize essence and blood to nourish true qi. Their bodies are still, but their minds are not. Have they not heard the *Scripture of Purity*: ‘The Way has purity and impurity, motion and stillness. Purity is the source of impurity; motion is the foundation of stillness.’ The Scripture says: ‘Neither defiled nor pure.’ True purity means no tears in the eyes, no pus in the nose, no saliva in the mouth, and no refining of urine or feces. Men must nourish essence, women must stabilize blood. All evils return to rectitude, and all diseases do not arise—only then is the elixir field truly pure. Today’s talk of purity is but a false name."*

*"Cultivation, if inner and outer harmonize, does not first speak of the Great Vehicle but first speaks of the Lesser Vehicle. The *Heart Sutra* says: ‘Capable of small, capable of great; not first speaking of the past, but first speaking of the present.’ The past is fruit, the present is function. It also says: ‘Function complete, fruit fulfilled; not first speaking of true, but speaking of false.’ Only the One Spirit is true; the four great elements of the fleshly body are false forms. Borrowing false to forge true, merging to become one."*

**Key:** *"Present comfort in the body is the Lesser Vehicle, the root of the Great Vehicle. The initial stage of the law: the mind is the Lesser Vehicle, the result is the Great Vehicle. The Lesser Vehicle is the root, the Great Vehicle is the branch."*

**Key:** *"Branch and root rely on each other; the branch borrows the root to grow."*

**Key:** *"All arise from yin and yang, borrowing the two substances of paternal essence and maternal blood as the body’s foundation. Today’s cultivators do not cherish paternal essence and maternal blood, dissipating true qi and depleting original yang. Thus comes aging, and with aging, illness, and within illness, death. Since impermanence exists, why not treat it?*

*The true Dao is empty yet real, real yet empty. The Scripture says: ‘The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao is nameless, nourishing all things.’ Those born from true nature are likewise so. In ancient times, the Venerable Lord refined metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, leaving behind three vehicles of wondrous speech. Each line eradicates sin, each phrase brings longevity. The first is the divine immortals embracing Oneness; the second is wealth and peace for the nation; the third is strong armies and victory in battle."*

**Question:** *"What is the divine immortals embracing Oneness?"*
**Answer:** *"Embracing Oneness is the fundamental root of all under Heaven."*

The One is the fundamental root of all things. The One is the Dao itself. In ancient times, the primal One was true water. Within water, *qi* arises; within *qi*, water forms. All things spring from the One, nurturing them into existence. The One generates Two, Two generates Three, and Three generates all things.

Within Three lie the Four Intelligences, the Five Eyes awaken, the Six Senses sweep clear, the Seven Spirits unfold, the Eight Trigrams are expounded, and the Nine Reflections of the True Dao are realized. Relying on the fruit of the Unleaked (Anāsava), the mind’s thoughts naturally abide as divine within the elixir field. Embrace and guard the primal *qi*—do not let it disperse. This is the method of *Embracing Oneness*.

**Question:** *"What is wealth and peace for the nation?"*
**Answer:** Within the bodies of men and women lie the Nine Rivers and Four Seas, the Dragon Palaces of the underworld. Their treasuries hold the Seven Treasures and Eight Jewels—do not let the Six Bandits (the Six Thieves) steal them away. This is wealth and peace for the nation.

**Question:** *"What is strong armies and victory in battle?"*
**Answer:** Victory in battle is something few in the world understand. Victory is the eternal method. The objection arises: *"You speak of the method of purity and stillness—how can you speak of the logic of victory?"*
**Resolution:** Those who do not grasp the method of victory cannot even treat the impermanence of illness and suffering. Victory consists of three stages:
1. First, vanquish the nameless afflictions;
2. Second, in the night’s realm, vanquish the Three Corpses and ghostly demons;
3. Third, vanquish all phenomena.
This is the method of victory. If one attains the Three Vehicles, one transforms calamity into fortune.

For those who practice, purity and stillness are the fundamental method of the Great Vehicle. To become a Great Vehicle practitioner, one must first arise from the Small Vehicle. Purity does not depart from impurity, motion does not depart from stillness—within stillness, motion arises; within impurity, purity naturally exists.

There is Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, water and fire, yin and yang—this is the True Dao. The Scripture says: *"Pure yang does not generate; pure yin does not grow. When yin and yang harmonize, they can give birth to all things."* Yet today’s practitioners do not cultivate the True Dao. The Dao is the comprehension of nature and life—nature and life are essence and blood. All human maladies stem from harming one’s life force. Even if one’s illness does not directly affect the Five Viscera, it still consumes the Three Treasures of essence, *qi*, and blood. To seek peace and longevity, one must uphold the awareness of purity and stillness.

For those not yet out of the household, if they cannot yet bear the fruit of purity and stillness in their youth, they may begin with the Small Vehicle, ascending to the Middle and Great Vehicles. The first stage is the City of Transformation, the second the Silver City, the third the Golden City. Like a great tree, the root must come before the branches. As always, purity and stillness are the true path.

**Question:** If one’s body is pure and still, yet encounters a day of Heavenly Demons, how should one respond? Again, if one encounters an external heterodox practitioner named *Bōxún*, how should one respond?

**Answer:** *Bōxún* is a boundary. Boundaries exist everywhere—one must only grasp the three essentials of retreat and advance, distinguishing purity from impurity.

If encountering those of *yin-yang* (heretical sects), use the method of "fire entering water to clarify the turbid," the law of "not boiling together."

**Secret Formula:** When demonic armies arrive, one must urgently prepare, inspecting the Three Thousand Strong Soldiers.

**Secret Formula:** The Three Thousand *Sūzhēn* (True Function) Methods.

The "Strong Soldiers" are *qi*. If *qi* comes but does not depart, accumulating over a thousand breaths, its *qi* remains in the *dāntián* without dispersing—only warmth is taught, not coldness—thus forming the embryonic immortal, a marvelous method.

If one attains such marvelous perfection, they will forever possess this true function. When the function is complete and the fruit fulfilled, one attains eternal peace and longevity.

All who cultivate must, when facing adversity, prepare with utmost care.

**Question:** How should one respond?

**Explanation:** When facing adversity, one first perceives the signs of death.

**Question:** What are the signs of death?

**Secret Formula:** The Celestial Pillar trembles, the tree falls, the mountain collapses; the Six Spirits are disordered, life and nature cannot be preserved; the spirit wanders in confusion, heaven and earth darken, the sun and moon lose their light—this is the seed of impermanence.

A leaky body is hell; a leak-free fruit is paradise. Those with leaky bodies must attain the perfect, leak-free fruit to all share in the Dao’s fulfillment.

**Question:** If the White Ox departs, how does one capture it?

**Secret Formula:** When the White Ox departs, urgently strike the *Xuánguān* (Mysterious Pass), firmly securing the Four Gates. Swiftly employ the Immortal’s Fishing Method, then use the Three-Island Hand Seal to point at the Yellow River flowing backward, covering the Golden Gate, and sealing with the Jade Lock. Like beheading the White Ox, it will not flee—this is the method of "the machine emerging from water to reach the other shore."

There are ten methods to stabilize life and nature.

**Secret Formula:**
1. The Golden Gate-Jade Lock Stabilization;
2. The Three-Island Reversal of Life and Death Stabilization;
3. The Nine-Twists Yellow River Backflow Stabilization.

These are the methods by which those with perfect, leak-free fruit all attain the Dao of Immortality.

If one stabilizes the Precious Essence, do not let it stagnate the waist and legs or dim the eyes—this is the method of stabilizing the Three Treasures.

**Question:** If someone stabilizes the Three Treasures and transports them to be stored where?

**[Secret Formula:]**
First, use the *Lúyá Chuān Xī* (Reed Sprout Piercing the Knees) Method, boiling *qi* to surge into the Treasure Furnace, guiding the bones to circulate *qi* until it reaches the *Yǒngquán* (Gushing Spring), supplementing the two feet.

Then, employ the Seven Circulations of the Elixir Method. If *qi* stagnates and weakens the waist and legs, practice the Iron Chariot-Black Ox Function, then open the Slaughter Gate.

If one attains the filling of the Original *Qi* in the abdomen, first perform the *Zhǒuhòu Fēi Jīn Jīng* (Elbow-Back Flying Golden Crystal) Method.

If one does not practice these methods—neither the Reed Sprout Piercing nor the Seven Circulations of the Three Islands—then employ the Elbow-Back Transporting Essence to Nourish the Brain Method, seeking eternal youth.

Today’s practitioners focus on the upper body but neglect the lower, like a child building a tower with an unstable foundation.

How does one fortify the Central *Qi*’s essence to be unshakable? Again, at the *Kān* Palace, use the Three Vehicles of Sheep, Deer, and Great Ox to transport treasure from *Jīngshān* (the Herculean Mountains).

**Secret Formula:** Near *Jīngshān* there was once a man named *Biàn Hé*. One day, while chopping firewood, he saw a phoenix perched on a stone. Biàn Hé knew there was treasure within, so he presented it to the emperor, who, enraged, amputated Biàn Hé’s feet.

**Secret Explanation:** *Biàn Hé* is perception; the "stubborn stone" is obstinacy. The phoenix is true *qi*, forming the body. The jade is the marrow essence within the bones. Amputation is the failure to practice the Reed Sprout Piercing Method.

**Secret Formula:** Those who excel in purity and stillness are said to have "completed the Lower Original Treasure," resembling the sun and moon. Then, use the Three Vehicles to transport treasure to the summit of *Kūnlún* (Kunlun).

**Lament:** Today’s people can speak but cannot create; they can explain but cannot reveal the secrets.

Again: "When practicing, the mind moves but the intention does not—today’s people are mostly deluded, neglecting their bodies."

The first divine nature is the Great Ox Vehicle, requiring the Green Ox to pull the chariot, the treasure loaded within being the Deer Vehicle.

The second is the White Ox pulling the chariot, the treasure loaded within.

The third is the warm *qi* moving fire—the Sheep Vehicle, the Red Ox pulling the chariot, the treasure loaded within.

When the Three Vehicles move, they first depart from the *Jīngshān* tail, enter the Earth’s Axis, pass the Heavenly Gate, pass the Lower Double Gate at the *Shènshù* (Kidney Vessel) acupoints—this is the waist and legs entering the *Cáoxī* (Caoxi) region. The spine ascends the Double Gate, which is the spine itself.

It ascends to the *Shàngshè Shàngyuán* (Upper Orchard, Upper Garden), the *Fēnshuǐ Lǐng* (Dividing Waters Ridge), and the *Tiāntái Lǐng* (Heavenly Terrace Ridge).

For women practicing this, first place *rúxiāng* (frankincense) before transporting, frequently advancing true fire. If one practices this for a year, it will make women like young boys.

Imagine the lead and mercury pearls shooting toward the *Pénglái* (Penglai) brain’s opening—the Heavenly Gate will open, revealing crimson clouds. True *qi* enters the *Suǐhǎi* (Marrow Sea), warming it, turning white hair black again—this is the *Zhǒuhòu Fēi Jīn Jīng* (Elbow-Back Flying Golden Crystal) Method.

My teacher said: "All see the well, but none use the rope." Though later-born, one possesses divine water returning to the *dāntián*.

When practicing, rise at the *Zǐwǔ* (Child-Midday) hours, sit in *Dùzuò* (cross-legged meditation), rubbing the hands as if true *qi* were boiling the body, passing the Heavenly Bridge, reaching the forehead and cranium.

Only guide the upper and lower jaws upward, using intention to divide true *qi*, flowing it downward from the *Tàiyáng* (Sun) and *Yuánzhōng* (Midline), descending to the jaws. From the left corner of the mouth to the right, gather the saliva as *Xuánzhū* (Mysterious Pearl) and *Gānlù* (Sweet Dew), using the Red Dragon to stir evenly, then rinse as snow-white flowers with sweetness.

The mouth is the Eight-Colored *Lílí* (Crystal) Channel, containing within it the Eight-Flavored Water. The two waters can generate the Eight Consciousnesses.

The mouth contains the hidden true *qi*. Within true *qi*, the Eight *Guà* (Trigrams) are divided:

- *Gèn* (Kan) as *Lìchūn* (Established Spring),
- *Zhèn* (Chen) as *Chūnfēn* (Spring Equinox),
- *Xùn* (Xun) as *Lìxià* (Established Summer),
- *Lí* (Li) as *Xiàzhì* (Summer Solstice),
- *Kūn* (Kun) as *Lìqiū* (Established Autumn),
- *Duì* (Xui) as *Qiūfēn* (Autumn Equinox),
- *Qián* (Qian) as *Lìdōng* (Established Winter),
- *Kǎn* (Kan) as *Dōngzhì* (Winter Solstice).

Within the Eight *Guà*, each generates *yīn* (darkness) and *yáng* (lightness), and within *yīn* and *yáng*, each divides into cold and heat.

The secret formula states:
Swallowing saliva is *yīn*, following it with *qi* practice is *yáng*. One must seek the even distribution of *yīn* and *yáng* waters and fires—swallow the two clear salivas in three portions, keeping two portions stored, lest the tree wither and exhaust.

It is also said:
*"Be sparing of water, lest it dry up like a severed river."*

Regarding the *Qīfǎn* (Seven Returns):
The secret formula states:
Swallowing the *shénshuǐ* (Divine Water) to the *qìkē* (Qi Nodes) within the lungs, the lungs transform it into fluid, effectively curing all coughs and wheezes. This gradually arises from the *pò* (Ethereal Soul).

It is also said:
Swallowing the saliva to the heart, it opens the mind to enlightenment and wisdom—this is also the water that washes the heart and reveals the true nature.

The hymn states:
*"Seeing the five-petaled flower bloom, step by step ascending to the Immortal Platform."*

The Divine Water transforms into blood—swallowing the Divine Water to the liver, the liver being wood, is called the *Qīnglóng* (Blue/Green Dragon) by convention. When the dragon receives water, it thrives, effectively curing all eye ailments. The *qi* transforms into saliva.

Swallowing the Divine Water to the spleen, the spleen being earth, allows earth to generate the yellow sprout when it receives water.

The abdomen contains the large and small intestines, the Nine Curves, reaching one inch and three *fēn* (portions) above the navel, with a diameter of one inch. The left is green, the right is white; the front is red, the back is black; the center is yellow, corresponding to *wùjǐ* (Wu-Ji, the Primordial Void). This is called the *Dāntián* (Elixir Field).

Within the Field stands a palace, named the *Huángtínggōng* (Yellow Court Palace).
Within it is a *lú* (kiln), named the *Dānlú* (Elixir Kiln).
Upon the kiln sits a single golden cauldron, steadfastly refining. Below, true fire is constantly fed; above, Divine Water is constantly added.
The Water and Fire are *Kǎn* (Kan) and *Lí* (Li).

The Fire and Water are the *jūn* (Sovereign) Fire, the *chén* (Subject) Fire, and the *mín* (Commoner) Fire. These three fires constitute the true essence—*xīnxìngyì* (Heart-Mind-Will) are they.

Those who have not attained the three essences:
- The first essence is not understood,
- The second essence is not realized,
- The third essence lacks the wisdom to attain the Dao.

If one attains the three essences, they achieve the *Sān míng liù tōng* (Three Clarities and Six Penetrations).

When refining fire, one washes above with water and tempers below with fire.
The scripture says:
*"Fire emerges from below the body, water from above. When the upper and lower unite, the Heavenly and Earthly trigrams align, commanding the dragon to coil around the golden cauldron, making the tiger retreat from the Elixir Field—this is the marvelous method."*

This is called the *Lúdāoguī* (Kiln-Cauldron-Pill).

If one practices this method, they will forever attain peace, comfort, and longevity.

The question arises:
*"Why do some speak of the 'one grain of Lúdāoguī' (Kiln-Cauldron-Pill), others of 'self-swallowed Lúdāoguī,' and others of 'Iron-Li Lúdāoguī'?"*

The secret formula states:
The three types of *Lúdāoguī* are treasures—*jīng* (essence), *qì* (energy), and *xuè* (blood).

The secret formula states:
- The *"one grain of Lúdāoguī"* is the saliva,
- The *"self-swallowed Lúdāoguī"* is swallowing saliva and ingesting *qi*,
- The *"Iron-Li Lúdāoguī"* is the practice of true *qi*, unyielding and unchanging, turning back all malevolent influences.

When practicing, one eats *jīnfàn* (Golden Food) when hungry, drinks *yùjiāng* (Jade Nectar) when thirsty, refines fire when cold, and refines water when hot.
The Fire is true *yáng* (lightness), the Water is true *yīn* (darkness).
This method is the art of extraction, addition, and regulation.

The secret formula states:
- *Extraction* is drawing true *qi* from above,
- *Addition* is drawing warm *qi* from below into the Elixir Field. If the kidney palace is warmed, all diseases will be dispelled.

The question arises:
*"Why do children, though pure and undisturbed, not lose their three treasures yet still suffer from unpredictable illnesses?"*

The secret formula states:
Children who are sick were, in their past lives, conceived when the mother’s *qi* and blood were deficient. They either suffered from the mother’s ten-month womb *qi* being insufficient or were exposed to the four climatic influences—wind, excess heat, summer dampness, and humidity—without caution, thus receiving an imbalanced womb *qi* and falling ill.

The question arises:
*"Why are there those with ugly and those with beautiful appearances? What does this signify?"*

The secret formula states:
Those with a noble appearance were conceived when the parents’ *yīn* and *yáng* energies harmonized with the sun and moon. If conceived before noon but after the *chǒushí* (Tiger Hour), or after midnight but before the *chǒushí*, they will be naturally upright and true, blessed with long life, wealth, and favored by their parents. Those conceived after noon but before the *chǒushí* may have flawed appearances—such as deformities, deafness, muteness, or stammering—often with inferior temperaments, displeasing to others, short lives, and lacking in fortune.

This is the root of creation.

The question arises:
*"If one encounters a vengeful spirit or demon, how should it be treated?"*

The secret formula states:
One should maintain purity and stillness.
*"Steal leisure in haste, and stillness in leisure."*

When facing hardship, urgently retreat. The *xīnwáng* (Heart-King) must employ the *guànxiǎng* (Irrigation-Contemplation) method: swiftly drive the spirit and intention into the upper *níwán* (Nasal Pill) within the *shéngōng* (Divine Palace). Sit upright and contemplate, envisioning before you Immortal Men and Immortal Women playing celestial music. Clench the teeth, steady the mind, and gaze upon the scenery of *Kūnlúnshān* (Kunlun Mountain), seeing the ox, sheep, deer, horse, and jade rabbit above. Fix your intention to seize and bind them.

During practice, suddenly imagine a precious tree above you, bearing flowers that bloom and yield fruit. Intend to pluck and swallow them—those who consume this will forever attain peace and longevity.

This is the method of rectification. A single phrase comprehended, the Great Lock secures the Four Gates.
The secret formula states:
*"The Blood-Sea, Life-Gate, and Qi steadied—no opening or closing of the door of essence, no distraction by external influences, the spirit steadied."*

The *jing* and blood are the essence of life. The singular intention is the true master.

The teeth are the *Xuan* Gate; closing the *dantian* is the lower *Xuan* Gate. Raising the refined *jing* upward is the *Jin* Gate. Clenching the teeth tightly is the Jade Lock. The six senses unmoving are the Six *Du*—called the *Du* Gate.

Drawing the lower jaw upward is the *Dingyang* Gate; the nose is the Heavenly Door; the spine’s cleft is the Twin Gates. When practicing, all locks open simultaneously.

When the spirit does not move, the intention is not disordered. The intention is vague—this is the method of purity and stillness.

In spring, summer, autumn, and winter, if a child’s urine is yellow, the *dantian* is depleted, and the lower *yuan* is lost. Preserve the true *qi*—urgently employ the *Chuān Jiǔqū* method, also called *Jiǔ Zhuǎn Chuān Xiǎocháng*, where the true *qi* penetrates ninefold into the kidney chamber, and the urine naturally becomes greenish-white. The body then attains peace and ease.

**Question:** What are the methods of the Three Vehicles?

The secret says: The lower vehicle is like a newborn babe, the middle vehicle like a child sitting on the ground, and the upper vehicle like a child walking. If one attains these three vehicles, one transcends the Three Realms—the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm.

This is the heart-nature and intention manifesting in the Three Bodies: the Pure and Still Dharma Body, the Fully Accomplished Reward Body, and the Threefold Meditative Transformation Body. Each has its own manifest divine signs.

The first assembly: the Most High refines the *Yi-Jia* (甲乙) Wood, which is the Void Plain. It is the gathering where Laozi wears green robes, saving three thousand green-robed Daoists, and turns the *Qing* Divine Scroll of the *Thirty-Six Sections of the Sacred Treasure Venerable Scripture*, leaving behind the *Nine-Transformations Dan* method of Yellow Sprouts Piercing the Knees as an absolute secret. The second assembly: Śākyamuni Buddha left behind the refining of the Southern *Jia-Ding* (丙丁) Fire, clad in fiery saffron robes, with three thousand red-robed *bhikṣus*, leaving behind the *Twelve Sections of the Great Vehicle Venerable Scripture*, the method of Piercing the Nine-Layered Iron Drums, and the Reed Sprouts Piercing the Knees method. The third assembly at Longhua: the Master in the *Xíxué* Hall of Lu Country refined the Western *Gēng-Xīn* (庚辛) Metal, with three thousand white-clad laypersons, leaving behind the *Ten Volumes of the Analects* and the method of Piercing the Nine Curves with Clear Pearls and Reed Sprouts Piercing the Knees.

The Three Teachings are like the three legs of a tripod, all converging into One, with neither two nor three—never departing from the True Dao. It is said: like a single root tree branching into three.

**Question:** How many grades of divine immortals are there within the Great Dao?

**Answer:** The *Transmission of the Dao Collection* mentions five grades of divine immortals. The first does not uphold precepts, does not abstain from wine and meat, does not refrain from killing, and does not cultivate virtue—these are the Ghostly Immortals. The second nourishes true *qi* and prolongs life—these are the Earthly Immortals. The third loves warfare—these are the Sword Immortals. The fourth sits in meditation and practices cultivation—these are the Divine Immortals. The fifth honors teachers, parents, and elders; practices the Six *Pāramitās* and myriad skillful means; rescues all beings; cuts off the Ten Evils; refrains from killing and consuming wine and meat. Their minds align with Heaven’s, upright and without deceit—these are called Heavenly Immortals. From the moment one first arises with a virtuous intention, that place becomes auspicious.

For those who greatly practice the virtuous path, there are prohibitions to observe. The secret says: In the fifth and sixth months, men and women should practice purity and avoid all taboos. In the eleventh and twelfth months, they should also practice purity. Moreover, in the fifth and sixth months—the months of great killing—men should avoid women, lest they incur the Five Labors and Seven Injuries. Men harm their lifespan, while women harm their essence—both deplete *jing*, blood, and *qi*. Depletion leads to left-sided paralysis, right-sided atrophy, and leukorrhea. If one depletes the Five Elements’ true *qi*, it is called Labor; if one depletes the Seven Treasures, it is called Injury. All diseases have their origins.

**Question:** From where do diseases arise?

**Answer:** All ten thousand diseases stem from the eight unregulated *qi* of the nodes.

**Question:** What are the Eight Evils?

**Answer:** The Eight Evils arise when yin and yang are disordered within the Eight Trigrams—the eight nodal *qi*. What leads one astray are hunger, overindulgence, toil, cold, heat, wind, dampness, and exhaustion. Pain from hunger, anxiety from cold, weariness from long journeys, fever from heat, and drunkenness—these are all unfit for practice and may turn into grave illness. One must instead practice purity and stillness. When practicing, collect the Jade Dew from the tongue, the Original Yang from the nose, and the Golden Elixir from the kidney chamber. If the essence and marrow fill the bones solidly, even after a hundred years of death, the sinews and bones will not decay—this is called the *Lianzi* Ring that Stabilizes the Bones.

The secret says: There are twenty-four great taboos for the Great Elixir—these are the twenty-four *qi* of the year. One must inform my teacher, seeking the marvelous secret, and must sincerely settle one’s intention. If willing to part with great wealth and pure offerings, the first is to give one’s body in alms, the second to offer flowers to the teacher, and the third to prepare meals for their nourishment.

**Explanation:** Giving one’s body in alms means, when one’s teacher, parents, or elders are in peril, to risk one’s life to save theirs. Offering flowers to the teacher means, when the teacher is about to scold or strike, to greet them with a smiling face and no resentment. Preparing meals for nourishment means, when there are delicious foods, to first offer them to the teacher. These are called the Three Alms.

The immortals say: Firmness is the Dao; joy is the cause. If one does not diligently seek a teacher, how can one attain the Dao? Old Master Lü says: Without a teacher’s guidance, this matter is hard to know. It is also said: To study without understanding is worse than not studying at all; to study without following a teacher is called *theft of learning*—a thief within the Law. If one conceals one’s ancestral teacher, one shortens one’s own lifespan, just like ordinary people. To boast of one’s own attainment is hypocrisy and pretension—can such a person truly attain the Dao? Such a person is said to be disrespectful toward teachers and contemptuous of the Law, unworthy of being a teacher. Before learning cultivation, to first aid others is to aid oneself. Those who practice merit should recognize their ancestral lineage: the Most High as Ancestor, Śākyamuni as the Lineage, and the Master as the Scripture.

Since the Three Teachings have fallen into stillness, all men and women are boiled in the River of Love, drifting in the Sea of Suffering, enduring torments, and sinking into the Six Paths—neither born nor extinguished, neither coming nor going. The Three Teachings’ Holy Sovereigns and the Three Realms’ Holy Mothers descend to rescue their children, their names and manifestations clearly recorded, their lifespans and seals verified as identical.

**Explanation:** The body is whole; those who receive precepts are recorded, and those who awaken to insight are like fire. The *Sūtra of Responding to Requests* says: The Wish-Fulfilling Seal Imprint manifests from the heart as its name. Ten names are the Ten Virtues, and ten names mark the adept. The first is *Yuanxiū* (元修), the second *Zhuǎn Míng* (转明), the third *Tōng Sānjiè* (通三界), the fourth *Chángshēng* (长生), the fifth *Guāngmíng Xiǎn* (光明现), the sixth *Yìtōng* (意通), the seventh *Quánshēn Zhǔ* (全身主), the eighth *Fúlù Zēng* (福禄增), the ninth *Tiān Yuán Xiū* (天元修), and the tenth marks the adept.

The Ten Virtues added to innate nature, and flawless merit naturally arises.

The Three Teachings are but the spontaneous transformation of beings according to intent, all without departing from the Dao.

The ancients said: *"The affairs of life and vitality are of utmost importance."*

Practitioners suffer birth, old age, sickness, death, and suffering. Yet people today do not comprehend the true Way, often clinging to emptiness and falling into emptiness, unable even to grasp the present—how then speak of the past?

Again, it is heard in the *Dharma Sūtra*: *"The past is not truly spoken of; the future is not truly real."*

The Most High refines the Nine-Cycle Elixir, removing disease and dispelling life and death.

The Master taught *rén* (benevolence), *yì* (righteousness), *lǐ* (propriety), *zhì* (wisdom), and *xìn* (faithfulness), lest people invite suffering upon themselves. Yet practicing these can also cure their ailments.

**Question:** How does one treat disease?
**Secret:** The greatest remedy for the eyes.

**Explanation:** *Chángdàhuān* (长大欢) is the remedy.
**Secret:** Joy is the root of the medicine.
Constant agitation is the root of all diseases.
But constant tranquility is the seed of the Great Dao.

Yet today, practitioners—whether monks, Daoists, or laypeople—men and women alike, perish from sudden illness or disease.

Or, men and women, whether married or not, may see their *dāntián* (丹田) lose its *língguī* (灵龟), dissipating true *qi* (真气), leaving the lower *yuán* (元) cold and empty, gradually giving rise to myriad diseases.

Men, through sixty-four days of purity, fill with *jīngqi* (精气); women, through forty-nine days of purity, fill with *xuèqi* (血气).

When extremes are reached, they return: purity returns to impurity, stillness returns to motion.

When the mind and intent scatter, true *qi* flees through the nine orifices.

Impure *qi* causes women’s menstrual flow to increase and men to dream of yin realms, stealing the Seven Treasures and Eight Jewels, thus falling ill.

**Question:** How does one treat yin spirits?
**Answer:** By the *Dāoguī* (刀圭) method.

**Question:** What is *Dāoguī*?
**Secret:** *Dāoguī* is One. It is water and *qi*, capable of generating all things.
*Qi* is the *guī* (圭), the cloud-water, the rain.

Again: exhaling *qi* is the *dāo* (刀), inhaling *qi* is the *guī* (圭). Functioning is the Ten Thousand Things. Verification is *Dāoguī*, which reverses aging to youth.

The scripture says: *"Fire issues from below the body, water from above. Water and fire are the medicines."*

**Secret:** *Lúyá chuān xīshàng xià héchē* (芦芽穿膝上下河车), install the furnace as the *zǐhéchē* (紫河车). *Bānjīng bǔ nǎo zhī shàngchē* (搬精补脑之上车). When fire enters, water warms; when water enters, fire cools. Water and fire moving in tandem are the gentle *yīndǐng* (铅鼎). When *qi* enters the furnace, the *xiū* (休) arises. At the moment of exchange, the *chē* (车) follows the fire, dispersing into the hundred meridians, nourishing the skin and making the body luminous—this is the method of cultivation.

**Difficulty:** Why do the fat perish first?
**Secret:** The fat are those who cultivate externally but not internally, their bones lacking marrow, their *dāntián* losing true *qi*—thus they decline and fall ill.
Those who cultivate the Inner Way are the seeds of ease and longevity.

**Secret:** *Chángjiào lóngpán jīndǐng* (长教龙盘金鼎), *hǔdá dāntián* (虎达丹田). The *Zhèn* (震) hexagram summons thunder; the *Xùn* (巽) hexagram summons wind. When functioning, gargle and swallow one great mouthful of saliva, dividing it into three degrees to swallow, pressing *qi* downward three times. Naturally, the sounds of *lóngyīn hǔxiào* (龙吟虎啸) arise.

It can also dispel all diseases of the abdomen. The sound is like thunderous drums and painted gongs.

The upper is *shēng* (升), the lower is *jiàng* (降).
**Ode:**
True emptiness, subtle principles—none know them,
Sitting at Qūjiāng’s end, watching swallows fly.
Thunder shakes the earth, terrifying ghosts and demons,
Precisely the moment of yin-yang transformation.

Before noon, add or subtract with water and fire.
The Dragon and Tiger follow the Golden Sage with wine,
The Yellow Crone, drunk, drags the King of Kings—who is he?

**Question:** The Golden Sage is a deity; the Yellow Crone is *qi*.
Yang *qi* is the infant; yin *qi* is the maiden.

The *Qīnglóng* (青龙) is the *qi* of the liver;
The *Báihǔ* (白虎) is the *qi* of the lungs;
*Kǎn-Lí* (坎离) are the essence and blood.

**Secret:** When functioning, sit like Mount Tài, stand like a pagoda. Secure the four gates, firmly knock at the *Xuánguān* (玄关). Gargle one mouthful of saliva, swallow it fiercely three times, passing *qi* over the *Lígé* (离隔). Activate it three times—naturally, the *qi* of Dragon and Tiger moves like sitting, standing, walking, or resting. Close the mouth, shut the eyes, and do not listen to sounds. Visualize within: daily, observe the *dāntián*. With intent, see it descend as you exhale, ascend as you inhale, never crossing the *Lígé*. Do not let it settle on the face. When the six *qi* gather, the central *yuán* (元) meets.

Pure *qi* circulates to the right; impure *qi* to the left.
Each turns nine times—*qi* cannot escape upward or downward, left or right. It coalesces into the furnace, called *lóngpán hǔyuǎn* (龙盘虎远). The *qi* naturally harmonizes.

Again, the infant and maiden unite as husband and wife. *Qi* gathers above the spleen to form the furnace—this is the *Huángpó pǐpèi* (黄婆匹配) method.
Also called the *Tiāndì jiāotài* (天地交泰) method.
Also called the *Kǎn-Lí jiāogòu* (坎离交媾) method—this is the method of bodily union without spiritual union.

Spiritual non-union is the method of purity and stillness, the method of a thousand cycles without movement or disturbance.

Today, people mostly cultivate external methods, not the Inner Path. They see the present Dao and past laws.

The cultivator has the Great Dao externally and the True Path internally—where none know it.

Before them lies a path of three *lǐ* (里), with three great ravines without bottom. How to cross?
**Secret:** The three great ravines are the Three Teachings and Three Vehicles, arousing the Three Corpses, establishing the Three Treasures, transcending the Three Realms.

Advancing another three *lǐ*, they see six deep gorges, impassable. What gate is this?
**Secret:** It is the Six Perfections and Ten Thousand Practices, the purity of the Six Roots, cutting the Six Enemies, restraining the Six Desires, erecting the Six Ladders.

Advancing another three *lǐ*, they see the three *chǎnfāng* (产枋)—the Pure Treasure *chǎnfāng*, the Seven Forests of Corpses—this is the moment of application.

Advancing another three *lǐ*, they encounter a garden called the **Discard-Fruit Garden**. An old man gazes fixedly at the garden gate—those with affinity pass through with empty hands.

Proceeding another three *lǐ* within the garden, they see a great tree where a golden ox is struck. By the riverbank stands a platform: the **Yellow-Gold Platform** for men, the **Phoenix Platform** for women, the **Immortal Fishing Platform**, the **Thousand-Flower Comfort Platform**, and the **Impermanent Homesick Platform**. At the river’s mouth, three women stand—this crossing is the **Demoness Ferry**. The crowd fills the boats and passes the river.

Advancing another three *lǐ*, they see a great mountain called **Sumeru Mountain**. On its slopes, a green ram appears—this is **Laozi’s qi**. On the western slope, a white ram—**Confucius’s qi**. To the south, a yellow ram—**the Great Awakened Golden Immortal’s qi**. The three rams guide the assembly into the mountain, named **Three-Sun Gathering Cauldron Mountain**.

Within the mountain stands a city called **Northern City**, with four gates, each bearing an inscribed plaque. The **East Gate** is the **Opening-Light Gate**, the **West Gate** the **Longevity Gate**, the **South Gate** the **Golden-Light Gate**, and the **North Gate** the **Great Sinking Gate**. These correspond to the **eye, ear, nose, and mouth**.

Entering the four gates, they find four caverns: the **Celestial-Music Cavern**, the **White-Cloud Cavern**, the **Bamboo-Kingdom Cavern**, and the **Longevity Cavern**. Within the caverns stand four temples: the **Unpolluted Temple**, the **Mysterious-Void Temple**, and the **Bamboo-Grove Temple**. **[Entering the four temples,]**, they encounter four fruits—**the Reclining-Meditation Arhat**, **Sthavira**, **Stream-Enterer**, and **Once-Returning Arhat**, who serve as the temple masters—these are the **Four-Fruit Immortals**.

Further on, they see five visions: the **First Vision of Fame**, the **Second Vision of Medicine**, the **Third Vision of Peaceful Yang**, the **Fourth Vision of True Suchness**, and the **Fifth Vision of Tusita**. Within these visions are five palaces: the **Double-Female Palace** (eye), the **Great-Dragon Palace** (mouth), the **Upper-White Palace** (nose), the **Crystal-Water Palace** (ear), and the **Heavenly-Balance Palace** (heart). Inside sits a great pavilion, twelve breaths high and low—this is the **Twelve-Storied Pavilion**. It includes the **Central-Palace Pavilion**, **Moon-Palace Pavilion**, **Heavenly-Immortal Pavilion**, **Treasure-Taking Pavilion**, **Holy-Well Pavilion**, **Law-Qi-Wonderful-Sound Pavilion**, **Dao-Recognition Pavilion**, **Meditation-Peak Pavilion**, **Mirror-Sun Pavilion**, **Bell-Drum Pavilion**, and the **Two-Saints Pavilion**.

Each year, on the first day of the twelfth month at the twelfth hour, the human body contains the **Twelve-Month Pavilions**, aligned with the twelve celestial stems and branches. On all sides rise nine palaces—these are the **nine orifices** of the body. The **Nine-Palace Palaces** are thus: to the east, the **Wind-Thunder Palace** and **Double-Grove Palace**; to the south, the **Purple-Micro Palace** and **Maitreya Palace**; to the west, the **Holy-Mother Palace** and **Graceful-Lotus Palace**; to the north, the **Dharma Palace** and **Crystal-Water Palace**; and at the center, the **Peace Palace**. This is called the **Nine Palaces**, akin to the earth’s nine regions.

Further, the **Micro-Palace Essence** totals ten states—these are the **Ten Kingdoms**: the **Jiao Ancestor Kingdom**, **Maitreya Kingdom**, **Flower-Blooming Kingdom**, **Lu-Yan Kingdom**, **Golden-Colored Kingdom**, **Lapis-Lazuli Kingdom**, **Sravasti Kingdom**, **Southern Meditation Kingdom**, **Heavenly-Jambu Kingdom**, and **Double-Sun Kingdom**. These ten kingdoms are the **Ten Stages**, each containing a **Tai Mountain**. The body is what? It treats the great disease of **seeding illness**, all of which harm life.

The body contains four great seas: **saliva is the Eastern Sea**, **blood the Southern Sea**, **marrow the Western Sea**, and **qi the Northern Sea**. There are also nine continents—**the small intestine**. And five lakes: the body is the **Dongting Lake**. **Essence is the Jade Lake**, **sweet dew the curdled milk**, **the heart the Mysterious Lake**, and the **small intestine the river-lake**. The **three celestial bodies** (sun, moon, stars) decline—**blood, qi, and essence wane**. This decline is like **mountains collapsing, seas drying, and earth splitting**. Within a day’s twelve *shichen* (时辰), one may sit and not surpass this person—when the work is complete and the fruit fulfilled, men refine their form as a **boy**, women as a **girl**.

The scripture says:
*"Form and spirit both refined, merging with the Dao’s truth—
this is the method of **extracting the fetus and replacing the bones**,
the true secret of reversing yin and yang, the five phases."*

The five phases contain **metal, wood, water, fire, and earth**. When **wood is strong in spring**, if internal wood is weak, people often suffer **eye ailments**. When **fire is strong in summer**, if internal fire is weak, people often suffer **dysentery**. When **metal is strong in autumn**, if internal metal is weak, people often suffer **coughing**. When **water is strong in winter**, if internal water is weak, people often suffer **hernia**. The **spleen is earth**; its season divided, the spleen’s yin and yang reverse and return.

The five phases mutually restrain each other: **metal restrains wood**, **wood restrains earth**, **earth restrains water**, **water restrains fire**, **fire restrains metal**. Water and fire are **yin and yang**. One yin, one yang—this is the **true Dao**, the **essence and blood**. Of the ten thousand diseases, none concern the five viscera; all stem from **depleting one’s parents’ essence and blood**. When the **elixir field weakens**, illness arises—**quickly gather the spirit and steady the nature**.

The *Nine Immortals Scripture* says:
*"The Dao is one. If one attains it, all things will succeed. When practicing, the spirit and qi circulate; the qi follows the will. When moving, it rushes forward—this is the **left general of yin**, the **yin spirit**. The **Six Jia** drive and turn, the **six aspects and eight recognitions** encircle the **one true soul** within, wandering the nine palaces, observing the ten kingdoms, descending the longevity platform. It makes the **baby and maiden** settle the elixir field as their furnace, kindle the fire, and refine the medicine. With intent, they see the furnace glowing red and the stove scorching hot—the elixir is nearly complete.

With intent, they envision the **Green Dragon** to the left, the **White Tiger** to the right, the **Vermilion Bird** before, and the **Dark Tortoise** behind. The four great deities each wield long spears and broad swords, guarding the medicine cauldron. If one repeatedly practices this work, they will forever attain longevity, causing **evil qi to disperse** and **true qi to arise**. Their mouth, as if drinking from **Jing Mountain’s Jade Spring**, naturally exudes sweet fragrance."*

「The second method involves the **Lower Twin Cavities** (下穴) connecting to the **Kidney Chamber** (腎堂), following the exhalation to draw in the **precious essence** (宝). When the **qi** enters the mouth, one spits it out thirty-six times as **snowflake** (雪花), and upon swallowing, it becomes **snow** (雪) in the **elixir field** (丹田).

Next, one seals the upper and closes the lower—**Heaven** (乾) and **Earth** (坤) harmonize, and **true qi** (真氣) fills completely. If the **spleen** (脾) is warm, all ailments will vanish. Like firing bricks in a furnace, when the time comes, it will naturally succeed.

As a hen brooding an egg or a woman carrying a fetus, one does not calculate the time—only when the body feels **aching** (疼) or **painful** (痛) does it resemble the **Iron Black Ox** (鐵黑牛) hauling a cart. This is the **true unity of qi** (真一氣) and **true unity of nature** (真一性). The **black** (黑) refers to the **descending qi** (下氣); when the **aching qi** (痛氣) is strong, it expels through the **large intestine** (大便); when the **distended qi** (肿氣) is strong, it expels through the **small intestine** (小便).

There is also the method of **Descending the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Axis** (降天關地軸法). Gazing at the **Neck Yang Gate** (項陽關) and the **Mud Pill Palace** (泥丸宮), one draws **true qi** (真氣) upward through the nose into the mouth, exhaling forcefully six times. The **Heavenly Gate** (天關) and **Earthly Axis** (地軸) will then appear as if **still and lifeless** (死不动). Those who practice this daily will perpetually balance **yin** (陰) and **yang** (陽).

On the **winter solstice** (冬至), **one yang** (一陽) arises; on the **summer solstice** (夏至), **one yin** (一陰) arises. The **winter solstice** (冬至) begins at the **Child Hour** (子時), gazing at the sunrise in the east as **yang** (陽); the **summer solstice** (夏至) begins at the **Noon Hour** (午時), and the sunset is **yin** (陰). This is the principle of **yin and yang returning and repeating** (陰陽返復之理).

When **earth qi** (地氣) ascends and **heavenly rain** (天雨) descends, the winds blow every **three days** (三日), and rain falls every **ten days** (十朝). If the **wind and rain follow their natural order** (風雨順時), the people will be joyful, and so too will one’s body be free of disease and long-lasting in comfort.

For those with **ten thousand afflictions** (萬病), each ailment has its own **true method** (真功) to cure it—one must apply it correctly. The primary method of refining the **Nine-Turn Return Elixir** (九轉還丹) includes the **Yellow Sprout Piercing the Knee** (黃芽穿膝) method, the **Striking the Nine-Layered Iron Drum** (射九重鐵鼓) method, the **Prince’s Four-Gate Pilgrimage** (太子遊四門) method, the **Golden Rod Pointing the Wheel** (金鞭指輪) method, the **Reed Sprout Piercing the Knee** (芦芽穿膝) method, the **Xuan Yuan Straddling the Fire** (軒轅跨火) method, the **Jade Maiden Touching the Body** (玉女摸身) method, the **Zhong Li’s Backward-Sheathed Sword** (鍾離背劍) method, the **Master Lü’s Fishing** (呂翁釣魚) method, and the **Chen Xi-Yi’s Great Sleep** (陳希夷大睡) method. All these **paths of practice** (法門) from the **Three Teachings** (三教) treat diseases effectively.

Further, there are signs of **transcending rebirth** (超生). When one practices this method, the **elixir field** (丹田) nurtures **hot true qi** (养热真氣), and at night, they often dream of herding cattle on mountains. The cattle—whether **red oxen** (赤牛), **green oxen** (青牛), or **immortals** (仙人), **Daoists** (道士), **palaces** (宮觀), **temples** (寺院), **grand paths** (大道), **fine dwellings** (好房), **high carriages** (高車), or **good trees** (好樹)—and if they dream of **children** (小兒女) or **noblemen** (大官人), it signifies that the **elixir field’s qi is robust** (丹田氣壯).

If one dreams instead of **barren paths** (小道荒棘), **villains** (惡人) seizing broken houses, or **collapsing pagodas, tombs, trees, and rivers** (塔墓樹倒河渡), it likely means the **elixir field’s qi is weak** (丹田氣衰弱) and requires **nourishment** (補之).

The **secret precept** (決) states:
*"Seal the three who speak of this—*
*Lest the Six Ears leak the immortals’ secrets."*

The **three** (三人) are:
1. The **disobedient husband** (不孝之人),
2. The **disrespectful or faithless husband** (不敬信之人),
3. The **husband who does not uphold or improperly transmits the precepts** (不傳戒不善之人).

Do not reveal this precept—**except to these three**. Beyond them, whether **man** (男子), **woman** (女人), **monk** (僧), **Daoist** (道), or **nobleman** (官人), all may receive the teaching and uphold the precepts. This **final secret of true cultivation** (修真成诀) is worth **a *mustard seed* of gold** (須弥金).

Though derived from various **scriptures** (經), it is **addressed to the contented** (安樂者)—a **Hinayana** (小乘) method. Though small in scope, it is the **root of Mahayana** (大乘). The **Scripture of Cause and Effect** (因果經) states that cultivation has **eight kinds of fields of merit** (八般福田), and the **field of merit for healing and saving** (救苦看病福田) is the **first in saving lives** (救生性), surpassing even **burning incense in southern temples** (南寺燒香) or **offering alms in northern monasteries** (北院送供).

To **save one life** (救一人之命) is like **constructing a seven-tiered treasure pagoda** (造七級寶塔). If **men** (男子) or **women** (女人) obtain this precept, they must not **carelessly transmit** (亂傳) it. If they do, they will **lightly betray the immortals’ secrets** (輕泄仙人妙機), and the **Nine Patriarchs** (九祖) will all **fall into ruin** (堕於沉沦), forever **confined to the Underworld** (酆都), unable to attain **human rebirth** (人身). Be cautious, be warned—**believe, accept, and practice** (信受奉行) it faithfully.

The **Final Secret of the Golden Gate and Jade Lock** (金關玉鎖決) is complete.»
