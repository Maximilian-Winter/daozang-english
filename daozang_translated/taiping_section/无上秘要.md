### **Juan 3: The Sun Chapter**

The Supreme Lord of the Southern Ultimate and Upper Primordial said:
The sun spans two thousand and forty *li* in breadth and length, forged of golden essence. Within, its radiance is of water essence; without, its flowing light shines forth. At its center lie cities and people of the seven treasures, with bathing pools where four kinds of lotuses—blue, red, yellow, and white—bloom. The people stand twenty-four feet tall, clad in vermilion robes, their lives waxing and waning with the four lotuses. Thus, the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer—proceed in turn.

The sun’s movement is governed by five *qi*-winds:
1. The Hour Wind,
2. the Direct Wind,
3. the Strong Wind,
4. the Revolving Wind,
5. the Traveling Wind.
Therefore, the regulation of the sun, moon, and stars, their ceaseless traversal of the Void, all depend on the winds weaving their warp.

The waxing and waning of the sun and moon’s movements arise from the convergence of the four seasons, their concealment and adornment. Above the Golden Gate, the sun passes through the Open Gate. Within the Golden Gate lies a pool of smelted golden essence, situated in the western quadrant.

Thus, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), the sun receives the refinement of its *hun*-soul within the Golden Gate, radiating its luminous brilliance beyond. At this time, its light is gentle and fresh, and the *qi* of all under heaven grows warm. This occurs once yearly, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

Proceeding onward to the Cavern Yang Palace, the sun’s upper abode, also called Li Luo, located in the region of Floating Blackness. On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), the sun within the Cavern Yang Palace exhales the essence of golden coldness, irrigating the palace. It further refines the Eight Rays in the Courtyard of Flowing Fire. At this time, the sun’s light grows dim yet intense, the yang *qi* overflows and scatters, and all under heaven swelters in great heat. This occurs once yearly, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

Proceeding onward to the Eastern Well, the moon’s passage of radiant brilliance, situated in the region of Dai. On the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), the sun within the Eastern Well bathes in its halo of light, gathering the Eight Pristine *qi* and returning to the Palace of Vast Cold. At this time, the sky’s light is lofty and clear, and all under heaven grows cool. This occurs once yearly, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

Proceeding onward to the Palace of Vast Cold, the moon’s upper abode, the canopy of the Seven Stars, located in the realm of Yu Shan. On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), the sun conceals its essence within the Palace of Vast Cold, donning its crown and nurturing its embryo. At this time, the sun’s light is dark and overcast, and all under heaven endures great cold. This occurs once yearly, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

In one year, the sun’s revolution completes its circuit, donning its crown in the four directions, totaling one hundred and eighty days. The remaining one hundred and eighty days belong to the moon’s domain. The separation and union of the two luminaries, the waxing and waning of yin and yang, mark the boundaries of their measured paths.

The Perfected of the Three Heavens call the sun *Round Brilliance of Luxuriance*.
The Perfected of the Nine Heavens call the sun *Lustrous Radiance of Purity*.
In the Heaven of Jade Worthies, it is called *Subtle Mystery*.
In the Heaven of Great Simplicity, it is called *Distant Light*.
The Immortals of the Heaven of Great Clarity call it *Great Illumination*.
The Supreme Perfected call it *Life of the Nine Luminaries*.
The Perfected of the Great Ultimate call it *Round Brightness*.
The Perfected of Eastern Florescence call it *Purple Radiant Brightness*, or sometimes *Imperial Round Pearl*.

In the Heaven of Primordial Purple, there is ever a radiant glow, dense as thin mist, from which the Nine Suns emerge, shining as one. The place of first light is the sun’s homeland.

*Source:* *Commentary on the Orthodox Scripture of the Great Cavern*

The Lady of Purple Tenuity said to the Divine Mother:
The sun is round in form yet square in its light; the moon is square in essence yet round in its image. The light is concealed within the form, the essence hidden within the image. The red light and yellow image are the *hun*-souls of the sun and moon.

### **The Moon Chapter**

The moon spans one thousand nine hundred *li* in breadth and length, its halo encircling seven thousand eight hundred and forty *li*. Within, it is illuminated by white silver, glass, and crystal; without, its blazing light shines brightly. At its center lie cities and people of the seven treasures, with bathing pools and groves of Eight Ascending Trees. The people of the moon stand sixteen feet tall, all clad in robes of blue-green. From the first to the sixteenth day of the lunar month, they gather white silver and glass, refining them in the smelter of blazing light. Thus, as the moon waxes, its light grows bright and clear.

From the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth day, in the groves beneath the Ascending Trees, they gather the flowers of the Three *Qi*, brushing away the light of the sun and moon. Thus, as the moon wanes, its light dims. The movement of the dark radiance is also governed by the warp of the five winds.

Thus, the system of sun, moon, and starry constellations courses through the Void, never resting. On the day of the Spring Equinox, the moon lodges above the Golden Gate. Above the Golden Gate lies the Gate of Spiritual Communication, where at this time the moon enters the refining pool of golden essence, tempered by the Stone Radiance and Water Mother, and adorned by the brilliance of flowering light. On this day, yang essence is poured into the Golden Gate, and yellow qi is received into the Jade Spring. The Supreme Perfected and all celestial beings gather the blossoms of the Ascending Trees to brush away the light of the sun and moon. The moon then bathes the countenances of the celestial beings with yellow qi. Therefore, on the Spring Equinox, the myriad qi grow warm, divine radiance harmonizes, and yellow qi and yang essence descend in union.

On the Summer Solstice, the moon lies concealed in the Cavern of Yang Palace. The Cavern of Yang Palace is the moon’s upper abode, where at this time it refines in the Court of Flowing Fire, tempered by the Eight Rays and brightened by the moon’s spirit-soul. On this day, yellow qi is poured into the Cavern of Yang, and yang essence is received into the Fire Palace. All celestial beings gather the verdant groves of Azure Void to brush away the light of the sun and moon, bathing the countenances of the celestial beings with yang essence. Thus, on the Summer Solstice, luminous qi surge, yang essence descends, yin receives the numinous, and the two radiances converge in splendor.

On the Autumnal Equinox, the moon lodges in the Hall of Vast Spirit in the Eastern Well, bathing in the Eastern Well’s pool to refine its spirit-soul and brighten the Eight Luminous Rays. On this day, the moon is tempered by yang essence in the sun’s radiance and exhales yellow qi into the Jade Pool. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the Ringing Trees to brush away the light of the sun and moon. The moon then bathes the countenances of the celestial beings with yellow qi. Thus, the Autumnal Equinox is the day of the Celestial Grand Assembly, when yellow qi and yang essence descend in exchange.

On the Winter Solstice, the moon lies concealed in the Palace of Vast Cold. The Palace of Vast Cold is the moon’s upper abode, where at this time it nurtures the moon’s spirit-soul. On this day, yellow qi is received into the Cold Pool. All celestial beings gather the verdant groves of Azure Blossoms to brush away the light of the sun and moon. The moon then bathes the countenances of the celestial beings with yang essence. Thus, on the Winter Solstice, the Dao of cyclical movement treads the path of enduring yellow qi and yang essence in confluence.

The moon’s course circulates through the four quarters, hence its phases of waxing and waning. The sun’s path is yang; the moon’s path is yin. Though they move in concert, their revolutions reach the crown and girdle, each dwelling in the four seasons. Thus, the sun divides one hundred eighty days of yang, and the moon divides one hundred eighty days of yin, traversing three thousand six hundred degrees in total. When they converge, yang qi excites yin qi like stone.

—From the *Scripture of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence of the Cavernous Perfection*

The Most High said: The Azure Thearch’s Lady of the Moon is named Hidden Pearl, styled Fragrant Infant. The Vermilion Thearch’s Lady of the Moon is named Concealed and Remote, styled Graceful and Void. The White Thearch’s Lady of the Moon is named Spiritlike Orchid, styled Luxuriant and Flourishing. The Black Thearch’s Lady of the Moon is named Knotted and Upright, styled Tranquil and Metallic. The Yellow Thearch’s Lady of the Moon is named Pure and Radiant, styled Bright Countenance.

—From the *Scripture of the Cavernous Perfection on the Congealed Radiance Racing to the Moon*

Stellar Categories

The Most High said: The Five Stars are the spiritual roots of the sun and moon, the five viscera of the Celestial Embryo. Thus, celestial essence twines and coalesces to form the Five Stars, upon which Heaven and Earth rely to gather qi, and to which the sun and moon are bound for their radiance. If celestial qi is not nurtured, the Three Convergences wane and wax; if terrestrial qi is not nurtured, the myriad beings wither and stagnate. Waxing and waning cause Heaven to quake and Earth to tremble. When the constellations fail to hold their positions, the sun and moon suffer eclipses; when the Five Stars disorder their courses, the Two Images lose their light. When Heaven and Earth harmoniously unite, the Five Stars gleam with clarity, and when celestial essence converges, the Five Stars shine brightly, illuminating the Great Void above and illuminating the ten thousand multitudes below. The multitudes’ gains and losses cause the Five Degrees to err and reverse; the multitudes’ harmony and auspiciousness cause the stars to flow in accord with the Dao. Their reflection reveals fortune and misfortune, even the most minute detail is made manifest; their mysterious illumination reveals the most subtle end, where hidden merits and transgressions reside. The Five Thearchs report above to the True Sovereign among the stars, and the True Sovereign memorializes to the Jade Lord of the Most High. Thus, by the turning of the light of the celestial stems, they demonstrate to the myriad beings, and by traversing their positions obliquely, they announce calamity and fortune. Earth establishes the Five Marchmounts to symbolize the Five Phases’ stars; humans establish the spirits of the five viscera to emulate the function of the Five Positions. When the Three Qi revolve and converge, Heaven and Earth are arrayed in completeness.

The essence of the stars communicates above with all essences and below shares in the radiance of the luminous fluid. They exhale and inhale the Three Flowers, rinsing and nourishing the ten thousand numina. The Wood Star is a round mirror of wood essence, the darkly luminous star of the Eastern Sun’s gorge. Within it are nine gates, from which emerge nine points of brilliance, their radiance hanging down nine million li. Each gate is presided over by a Green Thearch, and in total nine Green Thearchs stand guard at the gates, attending the Central Green Sovereign Perfected Lord. The Fire Star is a round mirror of cinnabar essence, reflecting and observing the Southern Pavilion Star. Within it are three gates, from which emerge three points of brilliance, their radiance hanging down three million li. Each gate is presided over by a Red Thearch, and in total three Red Thearchs stand guard at the gates, attending the Southern Perfected Supreme August Lord. The Venus Star is a round mirror of metal essence, resplendently shining as the Western Star of Grand White. Within it are seven gates, from which emerge seven points of brilliance, their radiance hanging down seven million li. Each gate is presided over by a White Thearch, and in total seven White Thearchs stand guard at the gates, attending the Western Perfected Supreme August Dao Lord. The Water Star is a round mirror of water essence, penetratingly reflecting the Northern Dark Star. Within it are five gates, from which emerge five points of brilliance, their radiance hanging down five million li. Each gate is presided over by a Black Thearch, and in total five Black Thearchs stand guard at the gates, attending the Northern Perfected Supreme August Lord. The Saturn Star is a round mirror of earth essence, overshadowing and stabilizing the Yellow Path. Within the Saturn Star are four gates, from which emerge four points of brilliance, their radiance hanging down four million li. Each gate is presided over by a Yellow Thearch, and in total four Yellow Thearchs stand guard at the gates, attending the Stabilizing Origin Yellow Perfected Lord.

—From the *Scripture of the Cavernous Perfection on the Eight Simplicities*

The Seven Stars are forty thousand li from Earth, encircling seven hundred and twenty li. Their walls are made of metal essence and lapis lazuli, and the Seven Luminaries’ purple radiance opens their light. Within are the wandering palaces of the hosts of celestial beings and perfected ones, with the Palace of Broad Cold as their canopy. In one day and night, they revolve and complete one circuit of the heavens, just like the wheels of the sun and moon. Within, there also grows a forest of the Seven Treasures. Thus, after the hours of *xu* and *hai*, at the inception of generative qi, the Seven Stars undergo refinement in the Palace of Broad Cold, brightly manifesting purple effulgence among the Seven Luminaries. Their radiant essence scatters and flows, their purple effulgence pervading the heavens, and they exhale fluid to irrigate the various heavens. At this time, the hosts of perfected ones and thearchic immortals all gather the radiance of the Seven Luminaries and the purple effulgence of the orchids.

—From the *Scripture of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence of the Cavernous Perfection*

The First Star, Celestial Pivot, is the spirit-soul of the Yang Brightness Star. When the Celestial Pivot Star is extinguished and does not shine, though it emits light, it does not illuminate, secretly penetrating the Great Void. It encircles nine hundred and twenty li, opposite the northwest gate of the Yang Brightness Star.

The Second Star, Celestial Chariot, is the spirit-soul of the Yin Essence Star. The Celestial Chariot Star’s radiance shines distantly but does not blaze, secretly penetrating the Great Void. It encircles five hundred and fifty li, opposite the west gate of the Yin Essence Star.

The Third Star, Celestial Mechanism, is the essence-spirit of the Perfected Person Star. The Celestial Mechanism Star is fierce but not manifest, blazing but not radiant, secretly penetrating the Great Void. It encircles seven hundred and seventy li, opposite the southeast gate of the Perfected Person Star.

The Fourth Star, Celestial Balance, is the essence-spirit of the Dark and Hidden Star. The Celestial Balance Star is faint and concealed, hidden yet penetratingly luminous, secretly penetrating the Great Void. It encircles eight hundred li, opposite the east gate of the Dark and Hidden Star.

The Fifth Star, Jade Transverse, is the spirit-numen of the Cinnabar Origin Star. The Jade Transverse Star is great yet silent, surging but not blazing, secretly penetrating the Great Void. It encircles seven hundred and twenty li, opposite the northeast gate of the Cinnabar Origin Star.

The Sixth Star, Opening Yang, is the spirit-numen of the Northern Culmen Star. The Opening Yang Star is bright yet secretly illuminating, radiant but not blazing, penetratingly pervading the Great Void. It encircles seven hundred and seventy li, opposite the northern gate of the Northern Culmen’s lower cavern.

The Seventh Star, Shaking Brilliance, is the spirit of the Celestial Pass Star. The Great Brilliance Shaking Brilliance Star’s light revolves through the empty cavern, turning the mechanism of the Celestial Pass, secretly blazing in the Great Void. It encircles nine hundred li, above opposite the south gate of the Celestial Pass Star, below opposite the Northern Culmen Star.

The Eighth Star, Cavernous Brightness, is the essence-spirit of the Auxiliary Star. The Yang Brightness Cavernous Brightness Star’s light revolves through the various heavens, gathering and turning the upper constellations, flowing yang through the Great Void. It encircles nine hundred and ninety li, above opposite the southwest gate of the Wheel Star, on the upper beam of the Celestial Pass, the yang radiance of the Northern Culmen.

The Ninth Star, Hidden Origin, is the spirit of the Adjuvant Star. The Hidden Origin Star is luminously empty and numinously concealed, resting beneath the canopy of the flowering parasol, secretly shining its radiance within the empty cavern. It encircles nine hundred and ninety li, above opposite the southeast gate of the Adjuvant Star.

From the *Scripture of the Nine Radiant Mornings of Cavernous Perfection on Aerial Flight*:

The Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Northern Culmen Perfected Sovereign, declared: In times past, I wandered the Northern Heavens, urging my chariot through the Vast Cold, treading upon the Flowering Canopy, my hands parting the Nine Origins. My transcendent radiance soared to the Cloud Palaces, roaming and sporting in the Northern Mystery, carefree in the Hall of Feathered Shade, resting at the Gate of the Terrace of Repose. Gazing upon the turning mechanism to summon the revolutions, hastening the kalpas’ convergence to dance the wheel, I sighed at the myriad things in their withering decline, yet looked down upon Heaven and Earth enduring forever. Thus did I realize the wondrous subtlety of the Nine Stars and awaken to the supreme numinosity of the Ten Spirits.

The Nine Stars are the numinous root of the Nine Heavens, the luminous beam of Sun and Moon, the abyssal origin of the ten thousand kinds. Thus, Heaven possesses nine qi, and the Nine Stars serve as its spiritual pivot; Earth possesses nine provinces, and the Nine Stars serve as their sovereign; humans possess nine orifices, and the Nine Stars serve as the mansion of destiny; the Nine Palaces of Yin and Yang take the Nine Stars as their gates and portals; the Five Peaks and Four Seas take the Nine Stars as their abyssal mansion. Therefore, the Five and the Nine interweave as an unending warp and weft, governing the celestial lodges, revolving the Three Luminaries, regulating the Four Qi, ensuring the enduring existence of Heaven and Earth, serving as the origin of the ten thousand kinds, and the foundation upon which gods and immortals rely.

If Heaven lacked the Nine Stars, it could not attain its lofty clarity; if Earth lacked the Nine Stars, it could not achieve its supreme numinosity; if humans lacked the Nine Stars, their nine orifices would not shine. The Supreme Thearch combines them to communicate with the Perfected; gods and immortals rely upon them to attain completion; the Five Phases ride them to reach their measures; and the myriad things receive them to obtain life. When Heaven is clear and Earth is tranquil, the Nine Stars blaze with brilliance; when Heaven is agitated and Earth is obstructed, the Nine Stars become veiled and dim.

**Chapter on the Three Realms**

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: To cultivate the Dao of aerial flight through the Three Realms, one must render the nonexistent utterly nonexistent and the existent utterly existent. By awakening to the threshold between existence and nonexistence—where the boundless unfolds without boundary—one naturally transcends the Three Realms, roams and revels in the Jade Capital, and soars through the ten directions.

**The Six Heavens of the Desire Realm:**
Great Yellow Sovereign Heaven of the Once-August,
Great Bright Jade-Perfect Heaven,
Clear Bright Howling Youth Heaven,
Mysterious Womb Level-Nurturing Heaven,
Primal Bright Literary Elevation Heaven,
Seven Luminaries Rubbing-Barren Heaven.

In these six heavens of the Desire Realm, yin and yang give rise to womb-born beings who live for ten thousand years.

**The Eighteen Heavens of the Form Realm:**
Void Transcending Balance Heaven,
Great Ultimate Concealing Veil Heaven,
Vermilion Bright Harmonious Yang Heaven,
Mysterious Bright Reverent Splendor Heaven,
Luminous Bright Ancestral Whirling Heaven,
Bamboo Grove August Reed Heaven,
Void Bright Hall of Radiance Heaven,
Contemplating Bright Upright Tranquility Heaven,
Mysterious Bright Reverent Celebration Heaven,
Great Radiant Ultimate Jade Heaven,
Primal Carriage Aperture Ascension Heaven,
Great Peace August Cliff Heaven,
Manifest Stability Ultimate Wind Heaven,
First August Filial Aura Heaven,
Great August Venerable Double Heaven,
No-Thought River Origin Heaven,
Upper Dice Joyous Music Heaven,
Ultimate Void Cloud Vow Heaven.

In these eighteen heavens of the Form Realm, yin and yang manifest form, yet remain distinct from the Desire Realm, never intermingling. Beings here are transformation-born, live for hundreds of millions of years, and neither die prematurely nor suffer harm.

**The Four Heavens of the Formless Realm:**
Luminous Court Rosy Dawn Heaven,
Abyssal Penetrating Primal Cavern Heaven,
Brush-Favored Wondrous Completion Heaven,
Elegant Joy Forbidden Upper Heaven.

In these four heavens of the Formless Realm, yin and yang possess form, yet bodies stretch hundreds of *li* without burden. Beings can conceal their forms and enter the infinitesimal, free from desire for form, knowing only the true appearance. Their years span kalpas, and though they do not study, they naturally perform good deeds, their blessings fulfilled.

Even demon kings who have not fully mastered the Dao may wander these heavens, yet they cannot transcend the Three Realms and remain subject to the great calamity of the fire kalpa. When the twenty-eight heavens cycle through mutual dissolution, all becomes chaos like a severed head. Those among them who study the true Dao may become seed-people; the Queen Mother welcomes them to ascend above the Four Heavens of Constant Fusion, Jade Prosperity, Brahmanic Crossing, and Splendid Flourishing. Those who study the sagely Perfected of the Three Realms but regress return to the human realm, passing through the Three Wretched Paths. Those who advance may ascend according to their merits.

Above each heaven lies a Gate of Life, within which are the hollow voids of chanting hymns, the demon kings’ numinous scriptures, and verses that rival the loftiest Perfected.

**First: The Aerial Flight Hymn of the Desire Realm**
The human path stretches far and faint,
The immortal path vast and boundless.
The ghostly path delights—
It is the human Gate of Life.
The heavenly path values life,
The ghostly path values endings.
The immortal path is ever auspicious,
The ghostly path ever inauspicious.
The exalted, pure, and numinous soar,
Mournful songs resound through the great void.
I only wish the immortal path to succeed,
Not the human path to wither.
In the Northern Capital’s Winding Spring Mansion,
A myriad ghosts gather.
They only seek to cut short human fate,
Severing the Gate of Life.
Sing the Cavern Chapter to subdue them,
Binding and sending the demonic essences to the Northern Feng.
Cut down the six ghostly blades—
The qi of the heavens surges boundless,
My Dao daily ascends in glory.

**Second: The Demon King’s Hymn of the Form Realm**
Lofty and vast, the bright qi soars on high,
Brahmanic practices fill the heavens, circling the ten directions.
Immeasurable great spirits—
All arise from my body.
I possess the Cavern Scripture,
Ten thousand recitations make one an immortal.
The immortal path values deliverance,
The ghostly path clings close.
Heaven and earth stretch boundless,
Foul qi swirls in murk.
The Three Realms bring joy—
Pass beyond them to endure.
Cross into my realm,
Your body enters the natural.
This joy in the moment—
Fleeting, by my grace.
The Dragon Han era surges boundless,
How can one distinguish the true?
My realm is hard to cross,
Thus I compose the Cavern Text.
Transform and soar through the void,
To test your body.
Success or failure, slackening or retreat—
How many will be delivered?
I laugh at those who fail to cross,
Thus I sing this hymn.

**Third: The Demon King’s Song of the Formless Realm**
Above the Three Realms,
The vast Great Luo stretches on.
No root of form above,
Cloud layers towering, majestic.
Only the Primordial Beginning,
Dwelling in the kalpa’s vastness,
Commands my realm,
Governed by the Mysterious Capital.
Those who transgress my realm
Enter the Jade Void.
I, the Upper King, rule,
Guiding and restraining the demon hosts.
Ten thousand transformations in the void,
Foul qi blooms in profusion.
Those who preserve the true are few,
Those who stray and delude are many.
The immortal path is hard to secure,
The ghostly path easy to corrupt.
The human path tests the heart’s sincerity,
Not by other immortals’ grace.
The Dao values the steadfast,
The Dao values the flourishing.
Those who do not delight in the immortal path—
How can they pass the Three Realms?
If they wish to traverse the Five Paths,
What can I do for them now? □

*From the* Scripture on the Salvation of Humanity Through the Cavern Mystery. **Chapter on the Nine Lands**

The Dao’s governance steers the world,
Unlocking the Mysterious Passage.
Three hues blend in primordial chaos,
Now present, now gone.
As the turning of fate reaches its limit,
The Three Qi radiate light.
Qi, pure and lofty, clarifies—
Accumulated yang forms Heaven.
Qi, congealed and turbid, coagulates—
Accumulated stagnation forms Earth.

*From the* Scripture of the Nine Heavens of the Cavern Mystery

The First Rampart: Glossy Earth
The Second Rampart: Rigid Earth
The Third Rampart: Stone-Fat Glossy Earth
The Fourth Rampart: Moist Glossy Earth
The Fifth Rampart: Golden-Grain Glossy Earth
The Sixth Rampart: Diamond-Iron Glossy Earth
The Seventh Rampart: Water-Restrained Translated Earth
The Eighth Rampart: Great Wind Glossy Earth
The Ninth Rampart: Cavern-Abyss Colorless Net-Weave Earth

These nine ramparts of Earth each possess Four Colored Earth Sovereigns:
The Sovereign of Proper Sound,
The Sovereign of Moving Sound,
The Sovereign of Wandering Sound,
The Sovereign of Brahman Sound.

Beneath the utmost depths lies the Cavern-Abyss Cavern-Source,
Weaving the world’s net,
Ensuring it does not fall.
Below, it is boundless and unbounded,
Without edge or limit—
All is the origin of the net-weave.

The Nine Lands and Nine Ramparts descend in nine layers,
Each with thirty-six sounds and thirty-six Earth Sovereigns,
Corresponding above to the Thirty-Six Heavens,
And in the middle to the Thirty-Six Kingdoms.
Thus, the Earth Sovereigns’ positions align with the titles of the Jade Emperor,
Yet their qi divides governance—
Only the names differ by rank.

Distances Between the Nine Lands:
The First Land lies ninety billion myriad *li* from Heaven.
The Second Land lies eighty billion myriad *li* from the First Rampart.
The Third Land lies one hundred twenty billion myriad *li* from the Second Rampart.
The Fourth Land lies twenty billion myriad *li* from the Third Rampart.
The Fifth Land lies twenty billion myriad *li* from the Fourth Rampart.
The Sixth Land lies twenty billion myriad *li* from the Fifth Rampart.
The Seventh Land lies twenty billion myriad *li* from the Sixth Rampart.
The Eighth Land lies eighty billion myriad *li* from the Seventh Rampart.
The Ninth Land lies eighty billion myriad *li* from the Eighth Rampart.

Beneath the Nine Ramparts lies the Cavern-Abyss Cavern-Source,
Weaving the world’s net,
Ensuring it does not fall.
Above, it is five hundred twenty billion myriad *li* from the First Rampart.

*From the* Scripture of the Cavern Truth: The Chapter on Foreign Lands and Liberation
*Chapter on the Spirit Mountain*

Fengdu Mountain lies in the north’s *gui* region, thus the northeast serves as the ghostly gate and the root of deathly *qi*. The mountain rises two thousand six hundred *li* high, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*.

*From the* Scripture of the Cavern Truth: The Heavenly Pass Three Charts and the Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees

To the south lies the state of Yishatuo. Beyond it stretches Long Isle, also called Green Mound. To its left and right stand Wind Mountains, whose peaks resound with constant tremors. Further lies Flame Isle, where Fireforest Mountain stands, and within its bounds dwell radiant beasts.

*From the* Scripture of the Cavern Truth: The Chapter on Foreign Lands and Liberation

Xuanlong Mountain lies northeast of Kunlun Mountain. Zhong Mountain resides north of the Weak Waters, nineteen thousand *li* distant. Its height reaches twelve thousand *li*, its summit spans seven thousand *li*, and its circumference measures thirty thousand *li*. Neither sun nor moon illumines it, yet its brilliance shines day and night, casting radiance a hundred thousand *li* beyond, where even the stars of the Milky Way cannot reach. The sages say the heavens are flawed in the northwest, and it is Zhong Mountain that illuminates the depths of the Nine Yin.

Kunlun Mountain rises thirty-six thousand *li* above the flat earth. At its summit lie three peaks, each spanning ten thousand *li*, its shape resembling an overturned basin. One peak faces due north, governing the essence of the Star of Dawn, and is called Terrace of Soaring Winds. Another faces due west, called Terrace of the Dark Garden. The third faces due east, called Terrace of Kunlun. Additionally, North Gate Mountain and Abyssal-Bearing Mountain are its branches, ascending to the depths of the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Pivot, the root of the myriad immortals, and the handle of heaven and earth’s revolutions.

*From the* Hidden Book of the Great Empyrean of the Cavern Truth

In the Eastern Flowery Realm stands Cloudwave Mountain, where the Lord of the Azure Youth at times rides the *qi* of the Round Pearl, ascends Cloudwave Mountain, and enters the Palace of the Gathered Flowers.

*From the* Jade Capital Mountain Scripture of the Cavern Mystery

Within the valleys of Mount Gouqu lies the land of Jinling, spanning thirty-eight *qing*. This is the land of the Golden Altar, where the soil is fertile, the earth rich, and the well water sweet. Those who dwell in this valley are destined to transcend the world and witness the Great Peace.

The *River Chart’s Inner Primordial Scripture* states: There exists a place where the earth is fertile, the soil rich, the water clear, and the mountains of Gouqu and Jintan lie beyond—such a place can transcend the world and ascend to the curved completion.

The *River Chart’s Central Chapter* states: Within the mountains of Gou and Jin, where mounds rise, neither weapons nor illness approach, nor do great waves ascend—this is the place.

The land of Jinling was anciently called the Land of Hidden Dragons. The *Record of Blessed Lands* states: The Land of Hidden Dragons lies west of Liugu Valley and to the right of Jintan, where one may dwell in lofty seclusion—this is indeed the blessed land of Jinling. Mount Gouqu is also named the Altar of Goujin, for within its grotto-heaven stands a golden altar a hundred *zhang* in height, whence its name derives. There is also Mount Jiji, so called for its accumulated gold, which likewise lends its name to the altar. Its source and marsh are termed the Cavern of Quju; observing the mountain’s winding contours, later generations combined the names to form Mount Gouqu. When the Three Lords Mao later governed its heights, the local elders transmitted it as the Mountain of Lord Mao. The hidden peaks of Mount Sanmao stand in succession, all bearing the single name of Mount Gouqu. Yet as people of the time described it in various ways, it acquired dozens of branch names, and this mountain is also called Gangshan.

The *Blessed Lands of Confucius* states: Between the ridges of Gangshan lies the Hidden Dragon Village, where one may avoid floods and illness. To the east stand Mount Sangai, Mount Sanhuo, Mount Santai, and the Two Golden Mountains—all renowned peaks of Gouqu, forming one mountain with Jintan. At the northern slope of Maoshan, where the grotto opens, lies Mount Liangchang, originally connected to Gouqu and sharing the same name. To the west lies another name for Mount Geyan, which is linked to neighboring peaks: to the west stands Mount Xuanxi, to the east Mount Yujuegen, and at the center Mount Ge. These three mountains intertwine, spanning three thousand *li* in circumference and rising two thousand seven hundred *li* in height, lying seventy thousand *li* from Kunlun. Within them stands Mount Gaohui, atop which a cavern radiates light like the sun, illuminating Mount Geyan, Mount Xuanxi, and Mount Yujuegen.

From the *Scripture of Daoist Traces*:

The Lady of the Purple Tenuity states: The Square Mountains stand true to the four directions, hence their name. Each face extends one thousand three hundred *li*, and the four sides together span five thousand two hundred *li*, rising nine thousand myriad *zhang* in height. There is also the Great Mountain of Everlasting Brightness, the High Mound of the Night Moon, each encircling a hundred *li*, and Mount Xuanhan. To the east, west, and south of the Square Mountains lie smaller Square Mountains, each three thousand *li* distant from the Great Square Mountains. The smaller ones measure three hundred *li* on each side. The Great Square Mountains face the south of Kuaiji, appearing seventy thousand *li* from its shores; gazing northeast, one sees the Village of Yanggu, six thousand *li* distant from the Square Mountains.

[Section on] Forest and Tree Species.

The Easternmost Azure Emperor Lord states: In the land of Dafu Li, there grows the Green Forest Tree, whose leaves bear natural purple script. When the wind stirs the trees, their rustling produces resonant melodies of sacred tones, luminous and resplendent, piercing the vast heavens. Above them ever dwell nine-colored phoenixes; those who obtain their feathers immediately gain the power of flight.

In the Westernmost Xina Yu Kingdom, there stands the Seven-Treasure Qian Tree, bearing crimson fruits and white rings. Upon it perch phoenixes, peacocks, and golden-winged birds, which day and night, in six watches, emit their refined songs.

*From the* Scripture of Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Writings.

The Most High states: On Jade Capital Mountain, seven-treasure trees grow naturally. A single tree shades an entire heaven, and eight trees shade the eight directions of the Net-Spanning Heavens.

*From the* Scripture of Cavernous Mystery and Jade Capital Mountain.

In the eastern land of Heluoti, beyond its borders lies Fusang within the Azure Sea, where forests grow like mulberry trees, each several thousand *zhang* tall, the largest three thousand *wei* in girth. They grow in pairs from the same root, bearing fruit red as mulberries, which immortals consume. Their bodies turn golden, and their fruits ripen once every nine thousand years.

In the southern land of Yisha Pond, beyond its borders lies the Green Mound, where a great tree grows, three thousand *zhang* tall, the largest two thousand *wei* in girth.

On Kunlun Mountain grow the Golden Root Trees, forests of jade branches and cinnabar fruits. The Jade Purity considers them its fruits, and the trees are all inscribed with the scripts of thirty-six kingdoms. Above them dwell purple phoenixes, simurghs, white sparrows, osprey, parrots, red crows, and azure magpies.

*From the* Scripture of Cavernous Truth on Foreign Lands and Dispersed Wonders.

Within the Azure Palace of the Square Mountains stand hundreds of jade trees. Above them dwell phoenixes and nine-colored birds; below them grow lingzhi herbs. Jade wells contain naturally flowing springs; those who drink them attain lifespans equal to the Three Luminaries.

*From the* Scripture of Cavernous Truth, Essential Azure Writings, and Golden Root.

Within the Solar Mansion of the Cavernous Yang Palace grows the Hollow Azure Forest. Those who consume its blossoms acquire bodies radiant with golden light.

Along the Moon’s Luminous Path, within the Eastern Well, lies the Palace of Vast Numinosity, where grows the Three-Blossom High-Ring Tree. Once an eon, it naturally produces three blossoms of *qi*, resembling the glow of hibiscus. Those who consume one blossom attain an age equal to one eon.

Within the Lunar Mansion’s Palace of Vast Coldness grows the Azure Blossom Tree, four thousand *zhang* tall. Its leaves resemble bamboo but are crimson; its blossoms resemble mirrors but shine brightly; its fruits resemble plums but lack pits—these are the Crimson Tree and Cinnabar Fruits. Those who consume its leaves gain long life; those who consume its blossoms share the moon’s numinosity; those who consume its fruits feast and wander in Jade Purity.

*From the* Scripture of Cavernous Truth, Yellow Qi, and Solar Essence.

Laozi, passing westward over the Great Tortoise Mountain, saw the Supreme Perfected Queen Mother eating jujubes inscribed with jade script, their fruits shaped like cakes, as well as azure peaches and purple pears. Further north, ascending the Cavernous Void Ridge, he saw the Northern Florescence Perfected Lord and the Four-Florescence Immortals eating Cavernous Void melons, which ripen once every four eons.

Anqi Sheng said to the Supreme Perfected Lady: "Once, I wandered with you along the western shores of Restful Peace, tasting jujubes of extraordinary sweetness. The jujubes here can never compare. Yet though I recall this but recently, three thousand years have already passed." The Divine Woman replied, "I once shared a single fruit with you, and we could not finish it. How could these small jujubes compare?"

*From the* Scripture of Immortal Fruits and Daoist Traces.

The Lady of Right Florescence states: "Fire jujubes and intersecting pears—these are the medicines of soaring flight, not to be compared with golden elixirs."

The men and women of the land drink and eat of the pool’s waters, their faces like jade cream, free from illness and sorrow. Their lifespan reaches thirty thousand years, with no untimely deaths. After their lives end, their bones do not turn to ash, and even after ten thousand years, no foul odor of decay arises.

*End of Scroll Four of the* Supreme Secret Essentials.

**Scroll Five of the Supreme Secret Essentials: Human Categories**

The Nine Heavens Venerable One addressed the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, saying: When heaven and earth intermingle their revolutions, the two images unite in perfection, and yin and yang descend their *qi*, ascending in resonance with the Nine Heavens. Flowing cinnabar undergoes nine transformations, congealing *qi* into essence; essence transforms into spirit, and spirit transmutes into human form. Thus, humans mirror heaven and earth, their *qi* following the patterns of nature. The *qi* of nature is entirely the essence of the Nine Heavens, which coalesces into the human body, nurturing and fostering it. After nine months, the *qi* reaches fullness, the *qi* of the Nine Heavens pervades all, and in the tenth month, birth occurs. The formation of the embryo and its transformations may be auspicious or inauspicious, long-lived or short-lived, all depending on the predispositions of one’s former existence. If the congealed *qi* is impure, the viscera accumulate stagnation, the six palaces suffer damage, form and spirit lack stability, the body cannot receive numinous power, and dead *qi* enters the orifices—how then can life endure?

Yang *qi* is vermilion and called Mysterious Cinnabar; yin *qi* is yellow and called Yellow Essence. When yin and yang unite, the two *qi* descend as essence, transforming into spirit and forming the embryo, ascending in resonance with the Nine Heavens. The *qi* of the Nine Heavens then descends to fill the Cinnabar Field, merging with essence to congeal and gather at the Gate of Life. It must undergo nine cycles—this is the Cinnabar Field, where the upper transforms and the lower congeals, giving rise to the human form. In the first month, *qi* is received; in the second, numinous power is received; in the third, transformation occurs; in the fourth, essence congeals; in the fifth, the head and body take shape; in the sixth, the form is completed; in the seventh, the spirit’s positions are arrayed; in the eighth, the nine orifices become clear; in the ninth, the *qi* of the Nine Heavens pervades all, and sound emerges; in the tenth, the Director of Destinies inscribes the register, and life is received at birth. Thus, all humans are endowed with the *qi* of the Nine Heavens. The essence of yang descending into yin is called the Nine Cinnabars, which together form the human body.

In general, when humans receive life and congeal *qi*, the Nine Cinnabars ascend to transform within the womb, following the *qi* of the Nine Heavens. When the *qi* is full and the spirit complete within the fetal sac, one naturally recognizes one’s former existence, knows one’s original root, and understands the causes of karmic rebirth. The *qi* of the Nine Heavens forms the body, and upon beholding the yang path, the Three Luminaries become manifest—yet one forgets the causes of one’s birth and origin. This occurs because the fetal root is obstructed, the Three Passes are blocked, the Five Palaces are disordered, and dead *qi* clogs the gates, preventing the numinous pass from opening and causing one to forget one’s karmic causes. If the numinous and true *qi* of the Nine Heavens refine the jade embryo, briefly passing through the Purple Portal and treading the human path, one emerges naturally radiant, beholding the numinous and ascending one’s body to the Nine Heavens—no longer forming through the congealing of essence and reception of *qi* to become human.

All humans are born endowed with the *qi* of the Nine Heavens; *qi* congeals into essence, essence transforms into cinnabar, and cinnabar transmutes into human form. The embryo contains brilliance, following the patterns of nature. For example, those born in the seventh month receive the *qi* of the Parīttābha Heaven; those born in the eleventh month receive the *qi* of the Brahmakāyika Heaven; those born in the twelfth month receive the *qi* of the Brahmapurohita Heaven; those born in the first month receive the *qi* of the Nirmāṇarati Heaven; those born in the second month receive the *qi* of the Tuṣita Heaven; those born in the third month receive the *qi* of the Yāma Heaven; those born in the fourth month receive the *qi* of the Suyāma Heaven; those born in the fifth month receive the *qi* of the Akaniṣṭha Heaven; and those born in the sixth month receive the *qi* of the Uttarakuru Heaven. From the tenth month of conception to the sixth month, humans receive the *qi* of the Nine Heavens, and by the seventh month, completing the tenth month, the *qi* of heaven and earth is full, receiving the revolutions of the Great Yang to be born.

*From the* Scripture of the Nine Cinnabars’ Upper Transformation of Embryonic Essence *in the Cavern of Perfection.*

The Most High said: When humans receive life, they congeal essence and accumulate *qi*, receiving the embryo and gathering blood. Yellow and white, dark and obscure, congeal; cinnabar and purple merge with mist. Thus, bones congeal, saliva is produced, fluids disperse and flow, four transformations converge, and the Nine Palaces unite as one. The Five Spirits command the form and body, and the Great Unity determines the talismanic register. In an instant, one stands; in a flash, one is complete; in a trance, one is fully formed; and in a sudden release, one is born. Thereupon, the Nine Spirits enter and settle in their palaces, the Five Viscera mysteriously arise, and the Five Spirits preside over them. Parents only know the beginning of their child’s birth but do not realize that the Celestial Lords and Five Spirits come to dwell within.

The human body possesses honored spirits whose abodes are not fixed, moving in and out of the Six Voids. The Three Fields above and below alternate between yin and yang, shedding the old and absorbing the new, circulating and transporting primordial fluids. The Great Spirit arises in emptiness, internally congealing to form the body, washing and refining the substance, transforming the radiance into brilliance.

*From the* Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected *in the Cavern of Perfection.*

Humans receive life from the celestial soul, take form from primordial numen, and revolve through the *qi* of the Nine Heavens. They extend their destiny from the Great Unity, opening the Three Paths, accumulating spirit in the Dark Palace. Thus, the mysterious fluid coils sevenfold, flowing essences spread moisture, the sun and moon illuminate the Six Voids, and the mouth and ears operate the spirit’s vessels. Clouds move and rain descends, their virtue emulating heaven and earth. Within the womb, the Five Causes come to completion, and the Dao of establishing humans is thus. The Five Causes are the Five Spirits; the Three Paths are the Three Perfected. The Five Spirits are the soul of heaven; the Three Perfected are the Dao of heaven; the Nine *Qi* are the embryo of heaven; the Great Unity is the source of heaven; the sun and moon are the eyes of heaven; the mysterious fluid is the abyss of heaven; the Six Voids are the light of heaven; the Dark Palace is the treasury of heaven; the spirit’s vessels are the transformations of heaven; and the primordial numen is the metamorphosis of the Celestial Lord.

All this refers to the Nine Heavens as the transformations of the Celestial Lord, who transforms and divides into nine—this is called the Nine Palaces. The Nine Palaces transform and merge into one. For those who wish to cultivate themselves and seek life, they must follow the origin of their birth. The origin of birth refers to the Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother. The Primordial Father governs *qi*, regulating and ordering the Celestial Prior; the Mysterious Mother governs essence, transforming and forming the embryo. Essence and *qi* complete each other, and yin and yang generate one another. Clouds move, and the omen is fulfilled; the Dao unites with the Nameless. The numbers arise from the Three and Five, and the omen begins to take form. When seven and nine are complete, the omen’s body is formed. Harmonizing the Three and Five, seven and nine penetrate the obscure, emulating the Celestial Prior. One must rely on the Celestial Lord’s cultivation, the Heavenly Sovereign’s merit, which transforms ninefold into numen. When merit is accomplished, the human body is complete, and body and spirit unite. When the spirit departs, one dies; when the spirit is preserved, one lives.

Thus, the Three Origins are the beginning of the Dao, the Celestial Lord is the root of the Dao, the Great One is the transformation of the Dao, the Nine Heavens are the spirit of the Dao, the Nine Palaces are the dwelling of the Dao, and the Mysterious Fluid is the essence of the Dao. By nurturing the Three Fields, one attains immortality; at dawn, one roams the Six Directions, and at dusk, one guards the Mud Pill. Firmly holding the embryonic essence, the heart remains ever joyful. Those who study the Dao must take this as their foundation. Only those who encounter this scripture may begin to comprehend it—where the nine *qi* refine and infuse, and the Great One moves the spirit.

—Excerpt from *The Hidden Book of the Great Cinnabar of the Cavernous Realms*

The Heavenly Worthy says: *Qi* flows continuously, giving rise to manifold conditions of existence. Whether fortune or misfortune, good or evil, each has its root in fate. It is neither heaven, nor earth, nor man—it arises solely from the heart. The heart is the spirit. The body is not truly ours; what enables us to live comes from the void and the natural, temporarily lodged in the womb, transformed and born. The parents who bore us in the womb are not our original parents; our true parents lie elsewhere. They are most noble and revered, supreme and unmatched. The parents who gave us birth in this life are but temporary vessels of karmic conditions, bestowing the grace of nurture and sustenance. Thus, we repay them with ritual and call them parents. Therefore, the form we receive is not truly our own—it is but a borrowed dwelling, a temporary abode, a lodging for the self. The body is attached to us as form, manifesting existence and nonexistence. Thus, those who attain the Dao no longer possess form. If I have no body, what suffering can I know? The suffering I endure arises only because I have a body. With a body, a hundred evils arise; without a body, one enters the natural. When conduct aligns with the Dao, body and spirit become one. When body and spirit unite as one, it becomes the true body, returning to the original parents and attaining the Dao.

—Excerpt from *The Inner Sounds of the Cavernous Heavens and Myriad Celestial Scriptures*

When a person is conceived within the womb, the Three Origins nurture and sustain, and the nine *qi* coalesce into form. Thus, on the ninth day, the spirits disperse, and when *qi* fills the body, it can utter sound. Once sound and spirit are complete, the Nine Heavens rejoice. The Great One holds the talisman, the Celestial Lord bestows rank and destiny, the Registrar records the ledger, the Director of Destinies fixes the lifespan, the Five Emperors oversee birth, the Holy Mother guards the chamber, and the deities of heaven and earth, along with the Three Realms, stand guard in full array. The Marshal of the Nine Heavens faces east in the courtyard, reciting *The Nine Heavens’ Chapter on the Birth of Spirits* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant in reverence; if female, they chant in devotion. If male, the Director of Destinies assents with respect; if female, she complies with deference. Only when the Marshal of the Nine Heavens issues the command and the myriad spirits chant their assent does birth occur. For one to be reborn into the human realm, emerging in the radiance of the Great Yang, startling heaven and earth, is a rarity beyond measure. The celestial perfected and earthly spirits, along with the Three Realms, all attend—such is no trifling matter. At the moment of birth, one is not to be deemed lowly. Therefore, those who cherish their form, preserve their spirit, honor their *qi*, and secure their root shall never perish but attain immortality, their bones and flesh ascending together to the Three Clarities. This is the virtue of *qi* uniting with the Three *Qi*, the Nine *Qi* merging as one. Yet, though born, people fail to revere their *qi*, honor their form, treasure their life, or cherish their spirit, bringing about their own ruin and severance from their original truth.

—Excerpt from *The Cavernous Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Chapter on the Birth of Spirits*

The Dao says: Among all things, humans are the most noble. If one can keep the body free of trouble and the spirit formless, cultivating tranquility to attain the intent of non-action, one unites with the Dao.

—Excerpt from *The Scripture of Wondrous Perfection*

Laozi says: The spirit gives birth to form, and form completes the spirit. Without spirit, form cannot generate itself; without form, spirit cannot fulfill itself. Thus, form and spirit unite, mutually generating and completing one another.

—Excerpt from *The Scripture of the Western Ascent*

Humans are the most numinous of living beings, yet they fail to know themselves and do not guard their spirit, thereby inviting manifold evils. Those who understand this need not seek protection from celestial spirits—sufficiency lies within the self. Thus it is said: The body of one person mirrors a kingdom. The chest and abdomen are like the palace halls, the four limbs like the outskirts, the divisions of the joints like the hundred officials, the spirit like the ruler, the blood like the ministers, and *qi* like the people. Therefore, he who knows how to govern the body knows how to govern a kingdom. Cherishing the people brings peace to the kingdom; treasuring *qi* preserves the body. When the people scatter, the kingdom falls; when *qi* is exhausted, the body dies. The fallen cannot be revived. Thus, the perfected person dissolves incipient suffering and cures unformed illness, fortifying before trouble arises rather than pursuing what has already passed. The people are difficult to nurture yet easy to corrupt, so one must carefully weigh authority and virtue to maintain order, curtailing desires to strengthen blood and *qi*. Only then does the True One abide.

—Excerpt from *The Scripture of the August One*

The Heavenly Elder says: Humans are born of yin and yang, grow through primordial *qi*, yet not all fully embody the nature of the Five Constants. Only one in ten attains it. Those who resonate with fire gain clarity; with metal, strength; with water, purity; with wood, sovereignty; with earth, benevolence. Those who fail to resonate perish. Thus, heaven and earth possess the Five Phases, which in turn generate twenty-five phases. If one resonates with one of these, one may live a hundred years; with two, a hundred and twenty; with three, a hundred and thirty; with four, one may cultivate arts and live a hundred and forty years; with five, one may practice minor Daoist arts and live two hundred years; with six, one may practice the Great Dao and live without limit; with seven, one may comprehend the minds of spirits and ghosts; with eight, one may penetrate the divine will.

Those who resonate with nine attain communion with the divine spirits; with ten, they gain wisdom and clarity; with eleven, they remain free from affliction throughout life; with twelve, they align with the celestial will; with thirteen, the Five Marchmounts come to pay homage; with fourteen, they gain the protection of the Twenty-Eight Constellations; with fifteen, they summon the Jade Maidens; with sixteen, they become sages; with seventeen, they summon the Queen Mother of the West; with eighteen, they summon the Lord King of the East; with nineteen, they summon the Great One; with twenty, they summon the Northern Lord; with twenty-one, they summon the immortals; with twenty-two, their body becomes one with heaven and earth; with twenty-three, divine maidens come to be their companions; with twenty-four, they commune with the Heavenly Emperor; with twenty-five, they befriend the Supreme Sovereign.

Three *cun* directly upward between the eyebrows lies the Palace of the Guarding Inch and Double Fields; one *cun* further inward lies the Palace of the Hall of Light; two *cun* further inward lies the Palace of the Cavernous Chamber; three *cun* further inward lies the Palace of the Cinnabar Field; four *cun* further inward lies the Palace of the Flowing Pearl; five *cun* further inward lies the Palace of the Jade Emperor. One *cun* above the Hall of Light lies the Palace of the Celestial Court; one *cun* above the Cavernous Chamber lies the Palace of the Ultimate Perfection; one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field lies the Palace of the Mysterious Cinnabar; one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl lies the Palace of the Supreme Sovereign.

Within the head are the Nine Palaces:
The Palace of the Jade Emperor, where the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity resides;
The Palace of the Celestial Court, where the Perfected Maiden of Supreme Clarity resides;
The Palace of the Ultimate Perfection, where the Empress of the Great Ultimate resides;
The Palace of the Supreme Sovereign, where the Queen of the Supreme Lord resides;
The Palace of the Hall of Light, where the Illuminating Perfected Lord, the Illuminating Youth Lord, and the Illuminating Perfected Maiden Lord—three lords—reside together;
The Palace of the Cavernous Chamber, where the Left Non-Male Child, the Right White Origin Lord, and the Central Yellow Elder Soul—three persons—reside;
The Palace of the Cinnabar Field, where the Supreme Perfected One of the Upper Origin and the Homeland of the Celestial Lord—two persons—reside.

The Palace of Mysterious Cinnabar, where the Perfected Lord of the Great One of the Mud-Pill resides;
The Palace of Flowing Pearls, where the Flowing Pearl Perfected Spirit, the Lord Controller of Destiny, conducts his affairs.

—Excerpted from *The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Simplicity and Numinous Vastness* of the Cavernous Perfection

The Red Child resides in the Upper Cinnabar Field Palace;
The Perfected Person resides in the Middle Cinnabar Field Palace;
The Infant resides in the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace.

—Excerpted from *The Jade Formula Scripture of the Four Palaces and the Feminine One* of the Cavernous Perfection

Within the human body, there are also three palaces and six viscera, one hundred twenty joints, and thirty-six thousand spirits. When a person commits evil, the body spirits report it to the three palaces; when a person performs good deeds, they celebrate their immortal name. Life and death, sin and fortune—none fail to first arise from the body spirits’ influence, resonating naturally in accord.

Humans are endowed with qi at birth, and qi coalesces into spirit. If one can nurture qi, the spirit will endure long; inwardly contemplating and guarding the true, the true will never leave the body.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of the Three Primes’ Admonitions* of the Cavernous Perfection

The spirit of the hair is named Xunzhi.
The spirits of the two eyes are named Yingming.
The spirit above the nape is named Eastern King Father.
The spirit of the forehead’s gate is named Lord of the Mud-Pill.
The spirit between the brows is named Primal Radiance.
The spirits of the two ears are named Delicate Maiden.
The spirit of the philtrum is named Great One.
The spirits of the nostrils are named Penetrating Hut.
The spirit of the mouth is named Cinnabar Pearl.
The spirits of the two hands are named Yin of the Hun.
The spirit of the Upper Prime is named Majestic Completion.
The spirit of the Middle Prime is named Yellow Child.
The spirit of the Lower Prime is named Life-Radiance Child.
The spirit of the shoulders and back is named Vermilion Bird.
The spirits of the two flanks are named Concealed.
The spirit of the yin is named Exhausted Scribe.
The spirit of women is named Cinnabar Completion.
The spirits of the two knees are named Pivot Duke.
The spirits of the two meridians are named Following Master Kong.
The spirits of the two feet are named Upholding Heaven’s Pillar.

These nineteen spirits take the mortal’s surname as their given name, where the name is the appellation, and the appellation is the name.

The Liver is the Venerable Master Lord.
The Lungs are the Lord of Supreme Harmony.
The Heart is the Grand Commandant Duke.
The Spleen is the Cinnabar Mother Child.
The Kidneys are the Minister of Instruction, Minister of Works, Controller of Destiny, Recorder, Minister of Justice, and Commandant of the Court.
The Gallbladder is the Supreme Dao Lord.
The Stomach is the Grand Master of Remonstrance.
The Navel is the Great One.
The Large and Small Intestines are the Envoys of the Primal Beam.
The Mysterious Valley is the Great General.
The Triple Burner: on the left, the Sheaf; on the right, the Grain; with the Wind Earl, Rain Master, Thunder Duke, and Thunderbolt.

These ten govern eighteen thousand spirits. If one preserves them, the eighteen thousand spirits will not scatter. When they do not scatter, Heaven bestows eighteen thousand spirits to attach to the body, combining with the thirty-six thousand to wholly animate the form. When earth ascends to the three heavens, one becomes an immortal, with boundless transformations.

Humans emulate Earth, and Heaven shapes their form; when the spirit abides, the form is preserved, but when the spirit departs, the form decays. Ordinary people, unaware of preserving the spirit, act and rest at will, their intentions foolish and deeds perverse—thus the spirit scatters and the form withers. The immortal perfected and sages guard the spirit without fail, constantly preserving their freedom, their names inscribed on the left tally.

Those who aspire to learning should know that within the human body dwell thirty-six thousand spirits: three hun on the left, seven po on the right, yin and yang conjoined to jointly assist the spirit of consciousness; the lords of the five phases in their waxing and waning; one thousand two hundred forms and shadows within the body, guarded by one thousand two hundred luminous essences without—preserve them daily, continue them hourly, and never forget them in every thought, and you shall attain long life without death. If unable to preserve them constantly, do not neglect them during the eight solar terms; by invoking the body spirits, you shall enjoy health and strength, free from illness. If illness strikes, call upon them thrice to dispel envy. Always protect the child-body.

When preparing to sleep, press the left hand upon the heart and the right hand upon the navel, each for fourteen repetitions. Silently recite the incantation:

*"The body’s spirits assemble, rising from the head,
Traversing the four limbs down to the ankles."*

Upon completing the incantation, visualize them fully, then surrender to sleep. Auspicious dreams will surely come, and you may faintly perceive the spirits. If transgressions have invited calamity, the spirits will speak to you, manifest in forms, or attach to objects, prompting reflection. Through this, you shall discern the meaning—whether fortune or misfortune—with clarity, thus avoiding disaster and aligning with blessings. All endeavors shall prosper.

The Three Hun:
1. *Tai Guang* (Fetal Light)
2. *Shuang Ling* (Luminous Spirit)
3. *You Jing* (Hidden Essence)

The Seven Po:
1. *Shi Gou* (Corpse Dog)
2. *Fu Shi* (Concealed Arrow)
3. *Que Yin* (Sparrow Yin)
4. *Tun Zei* (Swallowing Thief)
5. *Fei Du* (Flying Poison)
6. *Chu Hui* (Expelling Filth)
7. *Jian Fei* (Perceiving Lungs)

**Chapter on Kalpas and Cycles**
*—Scroll Six of the* Wu Shang Mi Yao

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: After the Dragon-Han era, heaven and earth collapsed into ruin. Within that vast expanse, for a hundred million kalpas, primordial radiance endured—above, no colors reappeared; below, no abyss returned. Wind and marsh filled the void, dim and obscure, formless and shadowless, boundless and infinite, a chaos without end. This was called the *Yan Kang* era. Only when the Crimson Clarity dawned and light returned did heaven and earth resume their places.

After one kalpa’s cycle, heaven and earth shattered again, plunging once more into darkness. For five kalpas, all was dim and obscure, the Three Qi in chaos, borne by the turning of fate. Only when the *Kai Huang* era arrived did heaven and earth resume their places.

The Supreme Dao Lord abided in the Great Blessing Hall of the Land of Everlasting Joy for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas.
The Azure Emperor Heavenly Lord dwelled in the Eastern Pole’s *Bi Luo Kong Ge* of the Great Floating Li Land for nine million nine hundred thousand kalpas.
The Vermilion Emperor Heavenly Lord resided in the Southern Pole’s *Chan Li* World of the Crimson Clarity Land for thirty thousand kalpas.
The White Emperor Heavenly Lord remained in the Western Pole’s *Wei Luo Da Tang* World of the Land of Ultimate Bliss for seven million kalpas.
The Black Emperor Heavenly Lord stayed in the *Yuan Fu Qi Xian* World of the *Yu Dan* Land for five million kalpas.

*—Excerpted from the* Dong Xuan Ling Shu Jing *(*Scripture of the Numinous Writ of the Cavern Mystery*).*

The Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Celestial Sovereign, the Celestial Venerable of the Supreme August, having received the sun and moon, drifted with the turning of fate, cycling through transformations. One radiance, one darkness; one destruction, one renewal; one death, one birth. The body undergoes ruin, one collapse, one completion. Traversing heaven and earth, the light alters, dim and distant, beyond comprehension. Since the Dragon-Han era, ninety-nine million nine hundred and ninety thousand great kalpas have passed.

*—Excerpted from the* Dong Xuan Zhu Tian Nei Yin Jing *(*Scripture of the Inner Sounds of the Cavern Mystery’s Myriad Heavens*).*

The Flying Heavenly Divine Persons of the Ten Directions addressed the Supreme Dao Lord: Since traversing the Three Realms and journeying through the thirty-two heavens, we have passed through great cycles, the revolutions of heaven and earth intertwining. Success and failure follow fate; life and death are not a single return. To this day, since the Crimson Clarity unfolded its pattern, nine thousand seven hundred billion kalpas have elapsed.

*—Excerpted from the* Dong Xuan Kong Dong Ling Zhang Jing *(*Scripture of the Numinous Chapters of the Cavern Mystery’s Empty Cavern*).*

The Dao said: The Celestial Pass lies at the northwest corner of heaven, aligned with the Dipper. The seven stars of the Northern Dipper are the handle of the Celestial Pass, the canopy of jade brilliance, the breath of the nine heavens and twelve celestial stems. When the Dipper’s handle turns the Pass, the nine heavens revolve together.

Heaven has four seasonal gates; the nine heavens comprise thirty-six seasons. In one day and night, the Dipper’s handle turns the Pass, passing through one seasonal gate. In thirty-six days, it completes the thirty-six seasons, and the thirty-six seasons’ completion marks one revolution of the nine heavens. One revolution of the nine heavens—three hundred and sixty cycles—constitutes one full cycle.

When the nine heavens complete one cycle, the qi of the six heavens all return to the uppermost three heavens. The three heavens alter their fate, hastening the meeting to expedite their passage. Three thousand six hundred cycles form the transition of a minor kalpa. When a minor kalpa transitions, the Nine Qi realign, the myriad emperors shift positions, the people perish, ghosts vanish, and the virtuous endure in purity. The six directions unite in peace.

Ninety-nine hundred cycles mark the end of a great kalpa. When a great kalpa ends, the count of the nine heavens is exhausted, and the fate of the six heavens is spent. As the six heavens near their end, qi surges between the Three and Five, and malevolent forces act with ferocity, seizing the moment to unleash their poisonous might upon the people. This arises from the exhaustion of fate and the extremity of numbers, riding the momentum to this outcome.

The Earth Mechanism lies in the southeast quadrant, beneath the Nine Springs at the mouth of the Nine Rivers, where the *weng* sound issues forth. The Numinous Mechanism connects upward to the celestial source’s flowing influx, and laterally swallows the profound depths of the nine caverns. The twelve temporal branches propel the four convergences of water eastward. In one day and night, qi accumulates, converging at the mechanism of the Nine Rivers. In thirty-three days, the mechanism turns—northwest receding, northeast expanding, southwest *weng*-ing. Expansion causes overflow; *weng*-ing causes depletion. Circulating through the four convergences, the celestial source flows downward, and the Nine Springs surge with waves—this is one cycle.

Three hundred and thirty cycles form one degree. One degree compels the Water Mother to hasten her meeting with the Dragon King, and the River Lord receives his reckoning from the Three Heavens. Three thousand three hundred degrees are called *Yin Pi*. When *Yin Pi* occurs, yin erodes, water surges, rivers burst, mountains sink, and the earth is submerged. Nine thousand three hundred degrees mark the end of a great kalpa, the extremity of yin’s fate. At this time, the Nine Springs surge with vast waves, the Water Mother stirs into motion, mountains and seas merge into darkness, and the six directions lie flat and open. This is the fullness of yin’s fate, the surging of earth’s qi.

Heaven is round with twelve guiding principles; earth is square with twelve temporal markers. The celestial principles turn the Pass through three hundred and sixty cycles for one revolution; the earth’s markers propel the mechanism through three hundred and thirty turns for one degree. Three thousand six hundred celestial revolutions form *Yang Bo*; three thousand three hundred earthly degrees form *Yin Shi*. Heaven’s qi reaches its extreme in the Great Yin; earth’s qi is exhausted in the Great Yang. Yang surges when stimulated; yin erodes when obstructed. When yin and yang surge and erode, the qi of heaven and earth reverse. The reversal of heaven and earth’s qi is called the transition of a minor kalpa.

When a minor kalpa transitions, the myriad emperors shift positions, the Nine Qi alter their courses, the sun and moon contract their revolutions, and the land surges into the Nine Springs. The Water Mother bursts through the Five Rivers, the Great Crow gathers at the Dragon Gate, and the Five Emperors convene in the Dark Capital. At this time, the wicked and defiled are extinguished, and the virtuous people endure.

Nine thousand nine hundred celestial revolutions form *Yang Shi*; nine thousand three hundred earthly degrees form *Yin Bo*. When *Yang Shi* occurs, qi is exhausted in the Great Yang; when *Yin Bo* occurs, qi schemes in the Great Yin. Thus, when yang is obstructed, it erodes; when yin is stimulated, it surges. When yin and yang erode and surge, heaven and earth transform—this is called the transition of a great kalpa.

When a great kalpa transitions, heaven overturns and earth upends, seas surge and rivers burst, people sink into mountains, gold and jade dissolve, and the six directions merge into darkness.

*—Excerpted from the* Dong Zhen San Tian Zheng Fa Jing *(*Scripture of the Orthodox Dharma of the Three Cavern Realms’ Three Heavens*).*

As the great kalpa of heaven and earth nears its transition, the perfected divine beings of the myriad heavens descend to roam the Five Marchmounts, gazing from afar upon the most learned people of the world. Amid the vast floodwaters filling the sky, they are all welcomed by the Five Dragons and ascended to the Blessed Lands, allowed to perish and be reborn together with the Primordial Beginning.

From the *Dong Xuan Yu Jue Jing* (*Scripture of the Jade Key of the Cavern of Mystery*):

The Most High Numinous Treasure governs the Seven Jeweled Mystic Terrace of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Mystic Metropolis. The perfected divine beings of the ten directions, the transcendent sages of wondrous conduct, and the flying immortals—all hover in the void, burning incense and scattering flowers. They circumambulate thrice daily, bearing the Ten Absolute Floral Banners in hand and reciting the Cavern Chapters. As sun and moon revolve in alternation, the Seven Stars turn the Celestial Pass. After three hundred thirty days, the Celestial Pass completes one revolution around the mountain. After three hundred thirty revolutions, the Nine Qi converge. After three thousand three hundred revolutions, the qi of heaven and earth intermingle. When the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, it is called the transition of a minor kalpa. After nine thousand nine hundred revolutions, a great kalpa reaches its completion. At this time, heaven sinks and earth vanishes, the nine seas merge into darkness, gold and jade dissolve, and not even the tiniest remnant remains.

**Rank of Emperors**
The Yellow Emperor said: The Three Sovereigns are the revered deities of the Three Caverns, the ancestral qi of the Great Existence. The Lord of Heavenly Treasure is the primordial origin of the Great Cavern’s Supreme Mystery and Jade Darkness. The Lord of Numinous Treasure is the primordial beginning of the Cavern of Mystery’s Supreme Simplicity and Primal Chaos. The Lord of Divine Treasure is the wondrous qi of the Cavern of Divinity’s Luminous Void and Supreme Emptiness. Thus, the Three Origins congeal and transform, and are called the Three Caverns. The qi-cavern of lofty emptiness resides within the division of the Great Veil. Therefore, the Great Cavern abides above the Jade Purity, the Cavern of Mystery lies within the domain of the Upper Clarity, and the Cavern of Divinity is collectively named within the Supreme Ultimate. The qi of the Great Cavern is the Heavenly Sovereign; the qi of the Cavern of Mystery is the Earthly Sovereign; the qi of the Cavern of Divinity is the Human Sovereign. The Heavenly Sovereign governs qi, the Earthly Sovereign governs spirit, and the Human Sovereign governs life. When the three unite to form virtue, the myriad things transform. Thus, the Heavenly Sovereign arises at the beginning of the *jiazi* epoch and the establishment of the Primordial Origin, ruling over the Three Mysteries of the Supreme Origin and the Empty Heaven. The Earthly Sovereign arises at the beginning of the *jiashen* epoch and the Supreme Numinosity, ruling over the Three Origins of the Primordial Simplicity and the Jade Heaven. The Human Sovereign arises at the beginning of the *jiayin* epoch and the Primal Chaos of Emptiness, ruling over the Seven Subtleties of the Vast Profundity and the Jade Heaven of Emptiness. The spirit of the Heavenly Sovereign is born prior to heaven, and after transforming to govern the world, each reigns for eighteen thousand years before ascending. There are also eight emperors who succeed in governance—those before Nüwa and Fuxi. They receive the numinous scriptures and wondrous arts to assist the sagely and aid in governance. Every emperor who rules must respond by delivering the world and establishing teachings, and thus their Dao is practiced. During the reign of the Heavenly Sovereign, he arranges and renews all things, receives the imperial writ, and determines the transformations to come. He records all matters of inception and establishment. After thirty-six hundred years, the Heavenly Sovereign’s transformation ends, and the Earthly Sovereign receives the mandate to oversee governance. Later, he petitions the Supreme Ultimate and receives the Earthly Sovereign’s writ to determine the renewal of heaven and earth. He receives the records of the Great Existence to branch out the newly transformed beings and unify them in equilibrium. The Heavenly Sovereign receives the fourteen chapters of the Great Existence’s imperial writ, the *Mysterious and Wondrous Illustrated Scriptures*, and summons the deities of heaven and earth, the lofty ones of the Nine Heavens, to review and rectify the renewal of heaven and earth and the inception of the myriad things’ transformations. The Earthly Sovereign continues thereafter, again receiving the imperial writ and summoning the host of deities to review and rectify with the *Mysterious and Wondrous Illustrated Scriptures of the Great Existence’s Mystic Center*. He governs the newly transformed kinds and aspects of the present ghosts, spirits, heaven, and earth, establishing the administration of their categories and numbers. Moreover, when heaven and earth possess fortune, the earth transforms without dissolution, and beings, though pressed, do not perish. They abide within the seven hundred twenty gates, transforming without altering their forms, changing species while their hearts remain unmoved. Those who preserve their past lives are rightly established as the Heavenly and Earthly Sovereigns, each completing thirty-six hundred years before transforming into spirits.

The Human Sovereign arises to oversee and act, again receiving the secret writs of the Great Existence. He summons the deities of heaven and earth, the parents of the lofty ones of the Nine Heavens, to further rectify all that exists and all that does not. He again rightly establishes those within the seven hundred twenty gates of transformation and the myriad ranks of the world’s rectification.

The Three Sovereigns said: The Dao of heaven is vast and great, mingling the worthy and the foolish. The strong dwell in the west, the weak in the east. The Nine Heavens determine the horizontal, the Nine Earths unite the vertical. Below, rulers and ministers form, establishing states and nations. Those who follow heaven prosper; those who do not meet misfortune.

*—Excerpted from the* San Huang Jing *(*Scripture of the Three Sovereigns*).*

The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, the treasure of the good, and the refuge of the ungood. Fair words can be traded in the marketplace; noble conduct can be bestowed upon others. If people are ungood, why should they be abandoned? Thus, the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes appointed. Though one may offer a large jade disk before a team of four horses, it is not equal to sitting and advancing this Dao. Why did the ancients value this Dao? Did they not say that by seeking it, one may obtain it, and by it, one may be absolved of sins? Thus, it is most precious under heaven.

**Rank of Continental States**

In the east, ninety thousand *li* beyond the Middle Kingdom, lies the land called Heluoti. Beyond its borders stands Fusang, amid the Azure Sea, a square realm spanning ten thousand *li*, where the Great Perfected King maintains a separate governance. Farther out lies Shengzhou, beyond Fusang, its western edge adjoining Penglai. This land spans two thousand five hundred *li*, lying twenty-three thousand *li* from shore. Upon it dwell tens of thousands of immortals; the land knows neither cold nor heat, its climate ever mild. It abounds in divine herbs of transcendence—those who consume them soar through the air in flight.

East of Fusang lies Zuzhou, amid the Eastern Sea, a realm of five hundred *li*, seven thousand *li* from shore. Upon it grows the herb of immortality.

In the south lies the land of Yishatuo, eighty-one thousand *li* from the Middle Kingdom, known as the Floating Li Kingdom. Beyond it stretches the vast Dongyang Wilds, also called the Land of the Fire Court. Outside its borders lies Changzhou, also named Qingqiu in the Southern Sea, a realm of five thousand *li*. Farther still lies Yanzhou, at the heart of the Southern Sea, spanning two thousand *li*.

In the west lies the land of Niveiluolüna, sixty thousand *li* beyond the Middle Kingdom, at the edge of the vast Haosu Mound and the frigid caverns of the wilds. Beyond its borders lies Liuzhou, in the southern reaches of the Western Sea, a realm of three thousand *li*, nineteen thousand *li* from the eastern shore. Fenglinzhou lies at the sea’s center, spanning one thousand five hundred *li*.

This land is called the Land of the Heavenly Mirror. Beyond it lies Xuanzhou, a realm of seven thousand two hundred *li*, surrounded by sea on all sides, thirty-six thousand *li* from shore. Upon it stands the Great Dark Capital, governed by the Immortal Earl and Perfected Lord. Farther still lies Yuanzhou, a land of three thousand *li*, ten thousand *li* from the southern shore.

Above lies the Land of Primordial Essence, the realm of natural purity in the Nine Heavens, where form and color dissolve, where shadow and shape vanish. The four directions enfold all heavens, yet only the Jade Void and Purple Palace remain, woven from the mist of empty caverns, within the void and purity of the profound.

*—Excerpted from the* Dongzhen Waiguo Fangpin Jing *(*Scripture of the Outer Realms from the Cavern of Perfection*).*

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning addressed the Dao Lords of the Five Directions: When this true scripture emerged in this land during the Dragon Han era, it was compiled alongside the Most High and Great Sage, the Jade Emperor, into the Ten Divisions of Wondrous Scriptures, to deliver the Dharma and save humanity. Thus, this land was named the Great Hall of Blessings, the Abode of Eternal Joy. Its earth is fused with molten gold, and its pathways on all four sides are adorned with azure jade and luminous lapis, their radiance shining through. Therefore, the men and women of this land enjoy long life, untouched by early death, spared from all suffering and the eight adversities.

In the easternmost reaches lies the Great Floating Li Kingdom of the Azure Vault, where the earth is entirely of azure jade, and the pathways on all four sides are adorned with gold and silver treasures, resplendent and luminous. The men and women of this land know no aging, no sorrow, no suffering, no affliction—only joy prevails.

In the southernmost reaches lies the Crimson Bright Land of the Chanli World, where the earth resembles cinnabar fat, perpetually suffused with crimson qi, like a veil of deep red clouds. The pathways on all four sides are of lapis, their brilliance blazing, illuminating the entire land. Here, no sound of sorrow is heard—only the sight of ageless people.

In the westernmost reaches lies the Great Hall of Weiluo in the Xina Jade Land, where the earth is paved with white jade and the steps wrought of gold. On all four sides, treasures gleam with radiant splendor, casting light throughout the land. Here, only the strains of refined music are heard, never the sounds of grief. The men and women of this land all bear countenances of golden hue.

In the northernmost reaches lies the Land of Utmost Blessing and Abandoned Wisdom in the Yudan Kingdom, where the earth is infused with congealed water essence and lapis, and the land holds a frigid pool spanning five hundred *li*. The men and women of this land drink from the pool’s ice, their faces like jade fat, free from illness, free from sorrow. They live for thirty thousand years, untouched by decay, and when their lives end, their bones do not turn to ash. This land knows no rites or music—only the truth of the straightforward heart. It is also called the Land of No Affliction.

Discourse on Intent

To dwell in greatness while embracing smallness, to reside in wealth while embracing poverty, to abide in the valley of flourishing humility, to wander the abyss of profound lowliness—subtlety is their foundation, sparseness their root. Fear and dread form their dwelling, anxiety and trepidation their gate. Fortune is the precursor of misfortune, profit the source of harm, order the root of chaos, existence the foundation of ruin.

The ruler of supreme virtue is unadorned and without embellishment, neither seeing nor hearing, yet embracing the mysterious. Without intent, as if yet unrooted, they hold fast to emptiness and follow nature. Chaos merges into oneness, returning to the original root. The highest intent is rectified in formlessness, governed in soundlessness, fostering fortune before it arises, severing misfortune before it is born—thus, none know its name.

The ruler of lesser virtue acts otherwise: exalted in lofty honor and wealth, displaying glory and prizing beauty, delighting in merit and fame. When misfortune arises, they grieve; when bandits and harm appear, they strike back; when their person is humiliated, they seek vengeance. Growth and nurture depend on their strength, distribution and bestowal on their blessings. Affairs are conducted by their methods, crookedness by their laws. Rewarding good and punishing evil breeds false virtue and deceitful loyalty—such is what they call merit and fame, yet it stands in opposition to the Dao.

*—Excerpted from the* Miaozhen Jing *(*Scripture of Wondrous Perfection*), "Discourse on Royal Governance"*

The regulator of life and death is Heaven; the follower of nature and destiny is man. Do not attack those who do not defy Heaven; do not kill those who do not defy man. Thus, when royal law ought to kill but does not, it indulges Heaven’s destroyers; when it ought to spare but does not, it slays Heaven’s virtue. Governing in this manner leads later generations to multiply prohibitions and strictures, fostering the root of oppressive power—yet no virtue surpasses the sparing of life.

The Way of Heaven benefits without harming; the Way of the sage acts without contending. Therefore, those who contend with the times prosper; those who contend with others meet misfortune. For this reason, armor and weapons are kept unstationed, for they do not contend. What is inauspicious, men do not contend for; what is base and shameful, men do not desire. To accept what others do not desire is sufficiency; to obtain what others do not contend for is tranquility.

Those bold in daring often wield power and make decisive judgments. Serene and joyful in their abilities, they transmit the state’s benefit to the people, do not shrink from the mighty, overawe the hundred officials, and crush resistance beyond the borders. Governing thus, they attain half of goodness.

Those gentle in restraint are yielding, diminishing, and retiring. Fearful and cautious in speech, they ponder deeply and plan far ahead, anticipate calamity in affairs, and devote themselves to enduring leniency and broad bestowal. Governing thus, they also attain half of goodness.

The daring serve Heaven and follow Earth, and nothing is more spiritually potent than perfect sincerity. With benevolence, they delight in bestowal; with righteousness, they enforce judgments; with propriety, they foster reverence; with wisdom, they eliminate harm; with trustworthiness, they establish affairs; with virtue, they achieve greatness. Pardoning others as they would pardon themselves, governing others as they would govern their own children—governing thus, they attain the utmost goodness.

Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending; not prizing rare goods prevents them from stealing; not displaying what may be desired prevents their hearts from being disordered. In the governance of the sage, he empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones. Ever causing the people to be without knowledge and without desire, he ensures that the clever dare not act—thus nothing remains ungoverned.

*(From the* Daoist Classic of the Dao *by Laozi)*

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish. When the Dao is brought to bear upon the world, its ghosts lose their spiritual potency. Not that its ghosts lack potency, but their potency no longer harms people. Nor does the sage harm people. As neither harms the other, their virtues converge and return.

*(From the* Daoist Classic of Virtue *by Laozi)*

In a small state with few people, let the people possess tools of tenfold or hundredfold utility yet not employ them. Let them value life and not journey far, so that though there be boats and carriages, none ride in them; though there be armor and weapons, none display them. Let the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping. Let them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, peace in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Though neighboring states lie within sight, and the sounds of their chickens and dogs carry across, let the people grow old without ever traveling between them.

The reason rivers and seas become kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel in staying low—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, when the sage wishes to rise above the people, he humbles his words before them; when he wishes to lead the people, he places himself behind them. Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not feel oppressed; though he stands ahead, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting him without wearying. Because he does not contend, none in the world can contend with him.

**Scroll Seven of the Supreme Secret Essentials: On Cultivating Truth and Nurturing Life**

Laozi said:
Heaven and earth unite their essence, yin and yang transform of themselves—yet calamities and misfortunes begin to sprout.
Indulgence in the changes of the five colors blinds one to the forms of fortune and misfortune;
Excess in the changes of the five tones deafens one to the sounds of good and ill;
Imbalance in the changes of the five flavors distorts speech so it no longer accords with truth or falsehood;
Greed for the changes of wealth and goods clouds judgment so one cannot discern uprightness from perversion.

When the five colors grow dense, the world goes blind;
When the five tones are tuned, the world goes deaf;
When the five flavors are harmonized, the world loses its savor;
When pearls and jade are prized, the world toils;
When coin and silk circulate, the world is overthrown.

Thus, the five colors are awls that pierce the eyes;
The five tones are hammers that block the ears;
The five flavors are axes that sever the tongue;
Wealth and goods are arrows that strike the body.
All these things, shifting and giving rise to one another, cannot be exhausted—
Hard to discern, yet easy to destroy;
Hard to obtain, yet easy to lose.
They are the palace of misfortune, the chamber of harm.

Therefore, the sage wears the color of no-color,
Listens to the sound of no-sound,
Savors the flavor of no-flavor.
Fame harms the body;
Profit defiles conduct.
Thus, to act is to levy a tax upon oneself—
Seeking glory, one gains little;
Doing good, one reaps scant reward.
For the fame that has a name empties my storehouse,
While the fame that has no name nourishes my dwelling.

To see beyond what the eye can bear dims its clarity;
To hear beyond what the ear can bear drains its essence;
To love beyond what the heart can hold drives the spirit away.
Pulled by desire, one hurries in affairs;
Rushing after profit, one trembles in motion.
Fear knits factions, and friendships are forged for self-aid—
This is not truth.
Though it does not accord with the Dao’s intent,
Even if one gains it, Heaven will not protect.

To entrust tasks to those unfit is to invite ruin; to engage in affairs beyond one’s capacity is to court failure. Thus, he who usurps the role of the Executioner must bear its blame, and he who takes up the carpenter’s tools will surely wound his hands.

Those who act yield to their passions and indulge their desires, gratifying the heart and exhausting the will. The lowly strive for nobility; the poor chase after wealth. Abandoning roots for branches, calamity becomes inescapable. No sin is greater than lust, no disaster greater than greed, no fault greater than transgression. These three are the chariots of misfortune—small, they destroy the self; great, they ravage the household.

*Excerpt from the* **Scripture of Wondrous Perfection**

The five colors blind the eye,
The five tones deafen the ear,
The five flavors dull the palate,
The chase of the hunt maddens the heart,
Rare treasures corrupt conduct.
Thus the sage tends to the belly, not the eye—
Discarding the one, embracing the other.

*Excerpt from the* **Virtue Scripture of Laozi**

Which is dearer, fame or the self?
Which is weightier, the self or wealth?
Which is more harmful, gain or loss?
Excessive love incurs great cost;
Hoarded wealth invites heavy loss.
He who knows contentment avoids disgrace;
He who knows restraint avoids peril—
Thus may one endure.

*Excerpt from the* **Virtue Scripture of Laozi**

The human form is a temporary convergence,
Yet within it dwells the spirit’s awareness.
This awareness, borne of qi,
Has no beginning, no end—
It arises of itself,
Refined or coarse in kind.
Life and death, suffering and joy:
Cultivate goodness, and joy abides;
Follow desire, and suffering in death recurs.
When suffering reaches its extreme,
It gives way to rebirth—
Yet without cultivating goodness,
Fleeting joy soon fades.
Thus the superior person exerts utmost vigor,
Accumulating virtue and forsaking evil.

*Excerpt from the* **Inner Vision and Hidden Writings of the Jade Radiance and Purple Glow**

Act, and the heart of Heaven responds;
Stillness attains the intent of Earth.
Speech that meets no resistance is called goodness.
Goodness is the root of the noble,
The chief of all conduct,
The dwelling of auspicious yang,
The coming and going of myriad blessings—
Flowing without stagnation,
Exhaustible yet inexhaustible,
Unchanged through a hundred kings,
Unaltered by common custom.
Above, it accords with Heaven;
Below, it accords with humanity.
It completes the ten thousand things,
Sustains and shelters all beings—
This is goodness.

To fail to recognize the Primal Head,
To overlook the Root Origin,
To deceive Heaven and belittle Earth,
To delude ghosts and defy spirits,
To twist words and distort intent,
To harbor resentment and tread in doubt—
This is ungoodness.
Ungoodness moves contrary to Heaven,
Rests in opposition to Earth,
Words harm beings,
Silence injures spirits.
To deceive Heaven and delude Earth,
To scorn ghosts and spirits,
To cling to self-righteousness,
To act against the sages—
Though it may seem good in the moment,
Evil qi gathers and flows.
Affairs may appear true in their falsity,
As mirages resemble clouds—
Yet lightning stirs not for them.
Thus the Dao of Heaven shows no partiality;
Humans, in turning against it,
Err of their own accord.

*Excerpt from the* **Scripture of Wondrous Perfection**

When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,
Ugliness arises;
When all know goodness as goodness,
Ungoodness arises.
Thus being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low incline toward each other,
Sound and voice harmonize with each other,
Before and after follow each other.
Therefore the sage dwells in non-action,
Practices the teaching without words,
Lets the ten thousand things arise without claim,
Gives life without possession,
Acts without reliance,
Leads without domination,
Accomplishes without dwelling.
Only by not dwelling
Does it not depart.

*Excerpt from the* **Dao Scripture of Laozi**

The Dao declares: Fortune and misfortune, blessing and calamity emerge from the unseen. Disaster is not something the rich and noble may petition to avoid, nor something the poor and lowly may wish away. Cultivate goodness, and fortune responds; commit evil, and calamity arrives.

*Excerpt from the* **Scripture of Ascending Origins**

Laozi said: I do not know those among the people who do good, nor those who do evil, nor those who act with loyalty and trust. Thus, when goodness accumulates, good qi arrives; when evil accumulates, evil qi arrives. Therefore the sage says: I cherish the beginning of all under Heaven and guard the Mother of all under Heaven—thus the ten thousand things revere and preserve life. My own intent remains unclear; how then could I know the good or evil of others? When goodness accumulates, divine clarity assists; the Dao of Heaven likewise protects the good.

*Excerpt from the* **Western Ascension Scripture**

The Lady of Purple Tenuity said to the Queen Mother: Hearing the Dao is difficult, yet not as difficult as hearing the Dao. Practicing the Dao is difficult, yet not as difficult as completing the Dao.

*Excerpt from the* **Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir of Cavernous Perfection**

It is difficult to be born into the human Dao,
More difficult to be born a man,
More difficult still to be born in the Central Kingdom,
Most difficult to be born in the family of a king, marquis, state preceptor, Daoist, or scholar.
To possess beauty and brilliance is difficult,
To believe in the Dao is difficult,
To practice the Dao is difficult,
To attain the Dao is difficult.

*Excerpt from the* **Scripture of Daoist Traces**

The Dao declares: For kings, nobles, Daoists, and commoners to be born as humans—
To leave the female form and become male is difficult.
Having become male, to possess keen intelligence,
All six senses intact,
A dignified and majestic form,
A voice like jade,
Qi like renowned incense,
Eyes like sunlight,
Drawing joyful admiration from all who behold—
This is difficult.
With all virtues already perfected,
To be born in a land of the Dao,
Where ruler and father are wise and virtuous,
Devoted to the Dao and its power—
This is difficult.
To be poor yet love the Dao,
Constantly mindful of bestowing kindness without ceasing—
This is difficult.
To be rich and noble yet believe in and honor the Dao,
Revering and serving the scriptures without negligence—
This is difficult.
To endure others’ malice without retaliation,
To master life and prevent decay,
To transcend the world and attain the immortal Dao—
This is difficult.
To behold the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns—
Cavernous Perfection, Cavernous Mystery, Cavernous Spirit—
To honor, recite, and venerate them with offerings and incense—
This is difficult.
To encounter and meet immortal sages and perfected beings,
To receive their teachings and transformation—
This is difficult.
These are the eight difficulties.
Without prior lives of diligent cultivation,
Accumulated virtue and merit in full—
How could one escape the foolish and deluded paths of the Three Evils
And attain this sacred assembly?

*Excerpt from the* **Secret Decisions of the Natural Scripture of Cavernous Mystery**

Perfected Lord Zhou said: The Dao may be learned,
Yet profound contemplation is truly difficult.

The immortal Dao may be sought,
Yet perfecting essence is truly difficult.
Perfected beings may be seen,
Yet nurturing will and nature is truly difficult.
Jade maidens may be employed,
Yet cultivating purity and chastity is truly difficult.

*Excerpt from the* **Cavernous Perfection Scripture of the Inner Chambers of the Grotto**

Grand Master of the Purple Prime said: In the world there are five difficulties:
To bestow alms while in poverty is difficult,
To study the Dao while in great wealth is difficult,
To master life and attain deathlessness is difficult,
To behold the Cavernous Scriptures is difficult,
To be born in an age of sagely rule is difficult.

*Excerpt from the* **Scripture of Perfected Traces**

The Lord said: Thus, those who study the Dao encounter nine afflictions—all grave maladies of humankind.
Should one discern these afflictions as maladies,
Then the immortal Dao is not far.
The afflictions are these:
One has aspiration yet no opportunity,
One has opportunity yet no companions,
One has companions yet no aspiration,
One has aspiration yet does not meet a teacher,
One meets a teacher yet does not awaken,
One awakens to the teacher yet is not diligent,
One is diligent yet does not uphold the Dao,
One’s will is confused and not steadfast,
One is steadfast yet cannot persist long—
These are the nine afflictions of humankind.
If in youth one delights in the Dao,
Firmly guarding the singular heart,
Neither water nor fire can frighten the mind,
Nor glory nor splendor sway the will,
Cultivating truth and embracing simplicity,
In time one will meet a teacher—
Then one need not fear the lack of anything.
Thus, one need not rely on companions to succeed,
Nor await inspiration to act.
This is the broad essential of immortal study.

*Excerpt from the* **Supreme Cavernous Perfection Scripture of the Great Ultimate Divination Signs**

The Perfected One said: The affliction is that one attains human birth yet does not cultivate virtue and nurture nature to preserve life.
The affliction is that one hears the scriptures yet does not believe.
The affliction is that one believes the scriptures yet covets wealth and does not receive them.
The affliction is that one receives the scriptures yet does not study and recite them.
The affliction is that one studies and recites them yet does not practice their teachings.
The affliction is that one practices their teachings yet does not persevere in the Dao.
The affliction is that one serves a teacher yet does not follow them to life’s end.
The affliction is that one ingests elixirs yet they do not take effect in time.
The affliction is that one’s Dao conduct is incomplete yet one boasts and seeks ascension.
The affliction is that one retreats to secluded mountains to read scriptures in quietude yet cannot endure its hardships.
These ten afflictions reside within a person.
If one does not guard against them,
The body will have no means of deliverance.
Thus it is said:
“There is a great affliction—it is that I have a body.”
This is what is meant.
Can one not reflect upon this?
Can one not reflect upon this?

From the *Dongxuan Scripture for Dispelling Demons*:

Valuing firmness and strength, scorning impulsive joy and anger—
Blessings and goodness depart through the gate,
While omens and calamities enter through the door.
Thus, the tongue and ears become afflictions,
And teeth and horns remain unsettled.
The mouth and tongue are the palace of misfortune and disaster,
The repository of peril and ruin.
Speech is where the great mandate resides,
The domain of punishment and calamity.
Words uttered invite affliction in,
Words misused bring ruin to the body.
Therefore, the sage fears when speaking,
Grieves when uttering words,
Ever as if treading on perilous ice.

From the *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection*:

Lord Dao-ling said: In the degenerate age, the people have three things to fear—examine them carefully:
First, jealousy toward the Dao and its teachings is to be feared;
Second, slander is to be feared;
Third, greed and desire are to be feared.
Jealousy toward the Dao and its teachings obstructs the circulation of scriptures and precepts;
Slander against Dharma masters weakens people’s faith in the Dao;
Greed for wealth and sensuality renders one despised by others.
These three—two external, one internal—must be absent before one may transmit the Dao.
One should diligently study and uphold them.

From the *Laozi’s Scripture of the Dao*:

Favor and disgrace are both met with alarm,
And the great affliction is prized as one’s own body.
What is meant by “favor and disgrace are both met with alarm”?
Favor, being inferior, is gained with alarm,
And lost with alarm—
This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace are both met with alarm.”
What is meant by “the great affliction is prized as one’s own body”?
The reason I have a great affliction
Is that I have a body.
If I had no body,
What affliction would I have?

From the *Dongxuan Jade Key Scripture*:

The Eastern Quarter’s nine *qi* form the Azure Heaven.
Heaven has nine origins;
The nine origins turn the Celestial Pivot,
Revolving thirty-three times in a cycle.
Day and night span thirty days;
Heaven’s *qi* completes one exchange.
Twelve exchanges make one degree.
Three hundred thirty degrees mark the Heavenly *qi*’s dominion over Wood,
When the Azure Emperor presides.
At three thousand three hundred degrees, the azure *qi* surges,
While the yellow *qi* wanes—
This is the yang number nine,
Nine being Heaven’s extremity,
Called the Lesser Yang Nine.
When the six heavenly *qi* ascend,
The hundred officials convene—
This is the Lesser Hundred Six.
At nine thousand nine hundred degrees,
The azure *qi* intensifies,
The yellow *qi* is eclipsed—
This is the yang number nine,
Called the Greater Yang Nine.
When the six heavenly *qi* reverse,
The hundred officials withdraw their *qi*—
This is the Greater Hundred Six.

The Southern Quarter’s three *qi* form the Vermilion Heaven.
The Celestial Pivot turns three hundred thirty degrees,
Marking the Heavenly *qi*’s dominion over Fire,
When the Vermilion Emperor presides.
At three thousand three hundred degrees,
The vermilion *qi* surges,
While the white *qi* wanes—
This is the Vermilion Emperor’s Lesser Yang Nine,
Lesser Hundred Six.
When the Heavenly *qi* surges in the Earth Palace during the years of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*,
The four *qi* drive out [harm],
And warfare and disaster spread.
Fire arises within Earth,
Gold and jade form naturally,
And the world is scorched and withered.
At nine thousand nine hundred degrees,
The vermilion *qi* intensifies,
The white *qi* is eclipsed—
This is the Vermilion Emperor’s Greater Yang Nine,
Greater Hundred Six.
When the *qi* intensifies in the Water Palace during the years of *hai* and *zi*,
Fire’s essence is extinguished,
Ten thousand *li* lie smokeless.
Floods overwhelm the heavens,
Only one in ten thousand among humans and beasts survives.

The Central Quarter’s one *qi* forms the Yellow Heaven.
The Celestial Pivot turns three hundred thirty degrees,
Marking the Heavenly *qi*’s dominion over Earth,
When the Yellow Emperor presides.
At three thousand three hundred degrees,
The yellow *qi* surges,
While the black *qi* wanes—
This is the Yellow Emperor’s Lesser Yang Nine,
Lesser Hundred Six.
At nine thousand nine hundred degrees,
The yellow *qi* intensifies,
The black *qi* is eclipsed—
This is the Yellow Emperor’s Greater Yang Nine,
Greater Hundred Six.
When the Heavenly *qi* intensifies in the Wood Palace during the years of *yin* and *mao*,
The nine soils collapse,
And the people have no place to stand.
Ten thousand plagues drive out [life],
Not one in ten thousand remains.

The Western Quarter’s seven *qi* form the White Heaven.
The Celestial Pivot turns three hundred thirty degrees,
Marking the Heavenly *qi*’s dominion over Metal,
When the White Emperor presides.
In the years of *shen* and *you*, the White Emperor’s Perfected Ones descend to the world to teach and transform.
At three thousand three hundred degrees,
The white *qi* surges,
While the azure *qi* wanes—
This is the White Emperor’s Lesser Yang Nine,
Lesser Hundred Six.
When the Heavenly *qi* surges in the Water Palace during the years of *hai* and *zi*,
Gold and jade dissolve and vanish,
Corpses fill the rivers and seas,
People devour one another,
And the seas turn to rivers of blood.
At nine thousand nine hundred degrees,
The white *qi* intensifies in the Fire Palace during the years of *si* and *wu*,
Metal and stone dissolve of themselves,
Warfare and disaster drive out [life],
And humans and beasts are extinguished.

The Northern Quarter’s five *qi* form the Black Heaven.
The Celestial Pivot turns three hundred thirty degrees,
Marking the Heavenly *qi*’s dominion over Water,
When the Black Emperor presides.
At three thousand three hundred degrees,
The black *qi* surges,
While the vermilion *qi* wanes—
This is the Black Emperor’s Lesser Yang Nine,
Lesser Hundred Six.
When the Heavenly *qi* surges in the Wood Palace during the years of *yin* and *mao*,
Crops wither and die,
Forests and trees collapse in great ruin,
Waters surge and rivers burst their banks,
Floods overwhelm the heavens,
People drift as corpses,
Bones and blood part ways.
At nine thousand nine hundred degrees,
The black *qi* intensifies,
The vermilion *qi* is eclipsed—
This is the Black Emperor’s Greater Yang Nine,
Greater Hundred Six.
When the Heavenly *qi* intensifies in the Earth Palace during the years of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*,
Rivers and seas run dry,
The seabed turns to dust,
And people, birds, and beasts
Are scorched to death without exception.

The five directions’ Celestial Pivots turn thirty-two times in nine thousand nine hundred degrees,
And the *qi* of the five directions all ascend to the Primordial Beginning.
The azure yang *qi* revolves within the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain’s Pivot,
Circling through the various heavens,
The sun, moon, and stellar lodges,
Beyond the ten voids.
After ninety-nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine degrees,
The *qi* returns at the juncture of one kalpa,
And Heaven and Earth, the myriad beings,
Mountains, rivers, and seas,
Metal, stone, and people
All dissolve and vanish at once.
Moreover, the yang *qi* turns the Celestial Pivot,
While the yin *qi* turns the Earth’s Mechanism.
The mouths of the nine rivers,
The ebb and flow of waters—
All correspond to Heaven’s divisions,
And their conjunctions follow the same pattern.
Thus, the yang number nine is called the Yang Nine,
And the yin number eight is called the Eight Disasters.
Heaven and Earth’s revolutions and degrees—
Humans are likewise the same.

From the *Dongxuan Jade Key Scripture*:

The Dao states: The Natural Revolutions of the Numinous Treasure include the Greater Yang Nine, Greater Hundred Six, Lesser Yang Nine, and Lesser Hundred Six.
Three thousand three hundred years make a Lesser Yang Nine and Lesser Hundred Six;
Nine thousand nine hundred years make a Greater Yang Nine and Greater Hundred Six.

From the *Dongxuan Revolutions and Degrees Scripture*:

Heaven’s adversity is called the Yang Nine,
Earth’s depletion is called the Hundred Six.

The Master Anqi said to the Lady of Supreme Perfection, Royal Consort Wang: "Formerly, when this humble one journeyed to the mouth of the Nine Rivers, I encountered the Lord Controller of Yang and the Lady of Western Han. Together we beheld a vision, and they inquired of me concerning the periods of the Yang Nine and Hundred Six. I replied that my years were few and I knew nothing of the reckoning of revolutions and adversities. Now that I have been granted this seat, I beg to ask of these numbers."

The Lady said: "The cycles of destiny flow vast and boundless—these are not matters you can swiftly comprehend. Yet Heaven and Earth possess the Greater Yang Nine, Greater Hundred Six, Lesser Yang Nine, and Lesser Hundred Six. Heaven’s adversity is called the Yang Nine; Earth’s depletion is called the Hundred Six. These two calamities mark the waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth, the surging and eclipsing of yin and yang. The greater cycle spans nine thousand nine hundred years; the lesser, three thousand three hundred. When this destiny converges, not even a sage-ruler can avert it. As for the vanishing of misfortune and the bequeathing of fortune—one can only await the joy that follows.

The Yang Nine: Heaven parches, seas surge, and the land scorches.
The Hundred Six: Seas dry, and hills sink into abysses."

From the *Daoji Jing* (Scripture of the Dao’s Traces):
The seventh scroll of the *Wushang Biyao* (Supreme Secret Essentials) concludes here. The eighth scroll is duplicated and thus not recorded; now it is fully preserved in the eighty-seventh scroll.

**Chapter on the Ascent and Descent of Spirit-Officials**

Should the August Jade-Pure Supreme Perfected Thearch violate the luminous statutes, they shall be struck from the Thearch’s register, demoted to disperse among the perfected, and relegated to govern the Central Palace of the Great Purity. After a hundred years, they may advance in rank according to their merit.

Should Upper-Purity Perfected Persons neglect immortal affairs, slacken in their duties, or fail in their true tasks—leaking precious precepts or conferring ranks upon the unworthy—they shall be struck from the register of Upper Perfected, reduced to serve as overseers of the Five Marchmounts, and may advance in rank after a thousand years according to their merit.

Those who hold the positions of Upper Primordial Lady or Primordial Lord but neglect their imperial duties, fail in their proper tasks, transgress ritual bounds, arrive late or miss appointed hours, or lightly divulge celestial treasures—thus conferring ranks improperly—shall be stripped of their Perfected Thearch’s register, demoted from the Purple Void’s rank, and placed among the wandering spirit-officials of the Middle Mystery and Pure Tenuity. After seven hundred years, they may advance in rank according to their diligence.

Those who bear the title of Great-Purity Immortal but neglect their official duties, delay or abandon immortal affairs, fail in their true tasks, or leak celestial statutes—transmitting them to the unworthy—shall be struck from the register of Perfected Immortals and reduced to serve as overseers of the Five Marchmounts. After two thousand four hundred years, they may advance in rank according to their diligence.

Those who hold the title of Flying Immortal of the Five Marchmounts but fail in their governance, neglect their immortal duties, or treat the Dao’s scriptures with disdain shall be struck from the register of Right Immortals and reduced to serve as overseers of the Three Offices. After two thousand four hundred years, they may advance in rank according to their diligence.

All who hold positions as overseers of the Five Thearchs, Four Directors, or Three Offices but fail in their proper duties, slacken or neglect their tasks, disregard celestial statutes, or mismanage affairs—imposing punishments unjustly—shall be stripped of their ranks as Right Perfected and reduced to serve as scribes and overseers. After three thousand six hundred years, they may advance in rank according to their diligence.

All who receive the Jade Tablets of Upper Perfected—whether as Gatekeepers, Supervisors, Jade Lads, Feathered Immortals, Attendant Gentlemen, Directors of the Upper Palace, Regulators of Standards, Overseers of the Perfected, Attendant Gentlemen of the Immortal Host, Masters of Prohibitions, Great Ministers of Rites, or Directors of Feathered Scripts—if they fail in their duties, neglect their proper tasks, or breach celestial statutes, shall be stripped of their Upper Perfected’s tablets and compelled to serve as scribes of the Three Offices, overseeing ghostly multitudes. After seven thousand years, those who demonstrate diligence may advance in rank according to their merit.

From the *Siji Mingke* (Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles):
**Chapter on the Assembly of All Sages**

The Most High Sage Emperor Lord proclaims: On the first day of the first month, the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and the eleventh day of the eleventh month—these six days of the year mark the times when the celestial virtue aligns in convergence. The Seven Sages determine the roster, the Five Emperors record the names, the Western Tortoise inscribes the register, and the Eastern Florescence compiles the scroll. On these days, the Primordial Celestial converges in jubilation; the Four Offices deploy their hosts, lofty canopies manifest on high, jade chariots of the Yuqing Realm revolve, the Nine Emperors gird themselves in the east, the Seven Sages unite in numinous power, and the myriad Perfected and ten thousand Immortals ascend to their stations in the Golden Court. The Three Mornings flank the imperial carriage, the Seven Origins blaze with radiance, heaven and earth are purified and resplendent, the Ten Realms stand solemn and clear. The Nine Heavenly Thearchs dispatch Perfected Inspectors, the Most High Seven Sages send the Left Immortal of the Registers, the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise commands the Five Elders, the Immortal Lords, the Four Hoary Ones, the Central Perfected, and the Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence to dispatch the Jade Lads who lead the Immortals. Each division of flying immortals, wheel-turning feathered riders, patrols the Ten Heavens and the Five Marchmounts and famous mountains, secretly observing those of the Cavernous Origin who have already attained the Dao, the wandering immortals and officials of the scattered ranks, and later disciples. Those whose names are recorded in the registers but whose bodies have not yet ascended, or whose dark records bear no name yet who cultivate with arduous diligence, their aspirations surpassing even the Jade Clarity—on high, they move the Jade Emperor. All who study with their bodies on these days, purify themselves in fasting, burn incense, cast aside all wayward thoughts, align their wishes with the celestial will, concentrate their thoughts in earnest meditation, and cultivate the numinous scriptures, shall be commended by the Five Emperors. Their names shall be inscribed on the White Tablets and recorded in the Azure Register, and the Four Poles shall be dispatched to descend and confer upon them the rank of Upper Perfected. On these days, should any treat the celestial treasures with disdain, divulge the mysterious scriptures, or incur the Seven Harms upon their bodies, they shall be impeached by the Four Offices and listed on the White Tablets. Their names shall be struck from the Azure Register and reassigned to the offices of ghosts.

From the *Dongzhen Qisheng Yuanji Jing* (*Scripture of the Primordial Record of the Seven Sages of the Cavernous Perfection*):

At midday on the sixth day of the first month,
At the evening meal hour on the first day of the first month,
At midnight on the seventh day of the third month,
At the breakfast hour on the ninth day of the fourth month,
At midnight on the fifteenth day of the fifth month,
At midday on the third day of the sixth month,
At midnight on the seventh day of the seventh month,
At midday on the fourth day of the eighth month,
At dawn on the second day of the ninth month,
At dawn on the first day of the tenth month,
At dawn on the sixth day of the eleventh month,
At midnight on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month.

From the *Dongzhen Basu Jing* (*Scripture of the Eight Simplicities of the Cavernous Perfection*):

On these twelve days, the Five Planetary Stellar Lords, the Supreme Perfected Celestial Lords of the Great Dao, and the August Lords of the Most High ascend together to the Upper Clarity, where they behold the Nine Profound Supreme Lords of the Dao. Moreover, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors of the Thousand Perfected and all the Flying Immortals of the Grand Clarity and above universally celebrate in the Grand Ultimate’s Upper Palace. There, they deliberate upon the diligence or negligence of those who seek the Dao in the world, and inscribe the jade names of those who study the Dao. These shall be engraved upon the Golden Pavilion and recorded upon the petal-bound registers.

The Five Venerable Divine Elders of the Primordial Numinous Treasure, the Heavenly Emperors and August Lords, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct regularly convene six times a year—on the first days of the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months—in the Uppermost Three Heavens’ Numinous Capital Palace, upon the Terrace of Primordial Yang and Purple Tenuity. There, they compute the celestial origins, examine and verify the revolutions of destiny. The Heavenly Emperors of each heaven dispatch the Great Ones of the Celestial Emperors, along with messengers of the sun, moon, and stellar lodges. The Three Offices summon and review, while the Five Marchmounts, Four Watercourses, and the great spirits of rivers and seas traverse the world below. None fail to investigate merits and transgressions, selecting and distinguishing the seed-people. During these months, all beneath heaven and upon earth tremble in solemnity, observing fasts and upholding precepts, revering and serving the Celestial Perfected. Scholars, in accordance with the regulations of these months, perform purification rites, their merits recorded by the Three Offices and their names listed by the Five Emperors.

---

The August Assemblage of the Most Sagely and Perfected Divine Lords of the Primordial Numinous Treasure in the Northwest Heaven, the Supreme Lord of the Boundless Dao, and the Perfected August Elder regularly convene on the first day of each month at the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Numinous Treasure’s Mystic Capital of the Northwest. There, they offer purification rites and present celestial documents, reviewing the merits and transgressions of humans and ghosts upon the earth. On this day, the Northern Dipper is commanded to descend, joining the Three Offices in summoning and reviewing, while the Four Departments expose deceit. They traverse the world below, investigating and examining the multitudes, itemizing the weight of good and evil to be reported above. On this day, those who uphold the upright purification rite, transgressing no regulations, have their sins expunged by the Three Offices. Their names are recorded in the Mystic Register, and the hosts of the myriad spirits guard and protect them, allowing them to become seed-people.

**The Third Hell: Mount Tai, the Prison of Blazing Flames**
Governed by the Azure Emperor.
In life, one hoarded wealth and goods, refusing aid to kin or stranger. When enemies came to ruin them—poverty, sickness, and suffering entwined—they grew deaf, senile, and withered, their spirit departing as their body perished. Upon death, they enter this hell, where fire-demons descend. They are burned, seared, and roasted, forced to swallow flames and devour coals. The severity of their torments spans kalpas of suffering.

**The Fourth Hell: Mount Heng, the Prison of Dark Abysses**
Governed by the Black Emperor.
In life, they were ignorant, clinging to perverse views, heeding demonic words, and slandering the true Dharma. Foolish and incorrigible, they drowned in wine and delusion, envying those greater than themselves, suppressing the worthy and wise, deceiving both the hidden and the manifest, acting with reckless arrogance, indulging in lust without restraint, and raging until their kidneys dissolved and their essence was spent. Their body perished, and upon death, they enter this hell, where earth-demons arrive. They are made to carry sand and bear stones, lashed as they draw from the dark waves, their bodies broken by iron rods. The severity of their torments spans kalpas of suffering.

**The Fifth Hell: Mount Song, the Prison of Universal Plunder**
Governed by the Yellow Emperor.
In life, they were faithless, fond of false speech, their words at odds with their hearts. They broke oaths and covenants, slandered others’ conduct, and deceived far and near, earning the hatred of both the hidden and the manifest. The workings of yin and yang turned against them, sealing their every path. Their bodies swelled with pain, their limbs grew heavy, their forms withered, and their spleens rotted. Their will failed, and their bodies perished. Upon death, they enter this hell, where wood-demons descend. They are beaten with clubs and cudgels, bound in fetters and stocks, sliced by wind-knives, and boiled in cauldrons. Every torment is inflicted, their bodies torn apart in the plundering—yet they are restored to life again, only to die once more. Reborn in the ghost-prisons, they endure the torments of the dark courts. The severity of their torments spans kalpas of suffering.

**The Roots of Sin, by Master Dongxuan Zhi**
North of Mount Fengdu lie twelve hells, each overseen by twelve officials with golden heads and iron faces, and fourteen hundred mighty celestial warriors, each wielding golden hammers and iron staves. Those who violate the Mystic Codes in life are, upon death, delivered to their respective hells, where the warriors’ iron staves beat them. Each kalpa is but one plundering; after three plunders, they may at last repay their debts in the Three Wretched Realms.

The Most High Dao Lord journeyed through the Eight Gates and beheld the earthly hells—deep pits and heavy cages, the Three Rivers and Nine Streams lined with knife-mountains and sword-trees, where starving ghosts and condemned souls toiled, their forms lost in ceaseless torment. The sight was unbearable, and in sorrow, he composed the *Chant of Suffering Spirits*:

Born into the realm of suffering spirits,
they wheel through the courts of the Five Paths.
The Nine Hells lock them in eternal night,
countless kalpas without light.

Knife-mountains bristle with sword-trees,
their poisoned blades sharp as talons.
No flocks of crows gather here—
only the cries of tormented souls.

The whirling wind scatters long branches,
its mournful echoes filling the cold courts.
Above, the mountain-treader endures,
never a moment’s rest.

Hunger is fed with crooked spring’s coals,
thirst slaked with cold fire’s essence.
Dragged through the endless wastes,
do they know the name of liberation?

Pity those who knew not their fate—
how it wounds the heart!
Sin and fortune each arise from causes,
good and evil truly spring from the mind.

The wheel turns without end,
like sound that never fades.
The Nine Hells keep their primordial records,
where kalpas seek each other in turn.

The cold waters have no source,
the long night seals them in heavy darkness.
No glimpse of the abode of fortune and virtue—
only the forest of destitute ghosts.

The long river offers no warmth,
suffering souls climb the peaks, wailing.
Their lonely cries reach the blade’s edge,
their sorrowful weeping falls upon the knife-ridge.

This form is no longer a form—
how it wounds the heart!

**Scroll Ten of the Supreme Secret Essentials #1**
*(Originally missing from the Daoist Canon; now reconstructed from the Dunhuang Manuscript S.80 fragment.)*

**Scroll Fifteen of the Supreme Secret Essentials**
*(Scrolls Ten through Fourteen originally missing)*

**Chapter on the Original Traces of the Many Sages**
**The Blue Spirit, the First Venerable Lord**

The Dao speaks: The Blue Spirit, the First Venerable Lord of the Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove in the East, once dwelt in the White Qi’s dominion during the Metal Kalpa. For a time, he was born in the Cloud Terrace of That Grove in the Heaven of Joyous Radiance, within the Vast Bright Jade Realm of the Infinite Western Lou, upon the Mystic Peak of Profound Luminosity. There, he was named Yuanqing, and in that heaven, he established vast merit and virtue, his resolve unwavering. His illustrious name resounded even unto the Vermilion Numinous Fire Palace, where it was inscribed upon the Crimson Tablets. His ascension as an immortal was near completion when, encountering a land abundant with beauties, Yuanqing’s thoughts scattered into worldly distractions. Malevolent spirits raised their impure eyes toward him, and the Vermilion Palace struck his immortal name from the records. Thus, in a single retreat, he passed through three kalpas. When the Fire Kalpa transformed the cosmic order, Yuanqing received qi and was conceived in the womb of the Hong clan, for heaven, deeming his past life’s fondness for sensuality, ordained that he be reborn as a woman.

In the first year of the Vermilion Numinous Era, in the bing-wu year, she was born in the Azure Youth Dragon Net Guardianship of the Heavenly Cavern of Bright Jade, in the Zhu-Huo Hills of the realm. Her surname was changed to Hong, and her given name was Natai. At fourteen, she revered and delighted in the Dao and its methods, her heart set upon becoming a divine immortal. She constantly purchased fragrant oils to keep lamps burning through the night, performing great merit and virtue, praised by all heavens. Her name was inscribed in the Upper Clarity, and the Supreme Numinous Purple Void Lady of the Southern Culmen, disguised as a commoner, descended to instruct her. Seeing Natai’s purity and devotion to the utmost dharma, she turned her chariot at the Zhu-Huo Hills and bestowed upon Natai the *True Writ of the Vermilion Script of the Southern Treasure Numinosity*.

Thereupon, Natai exerted herself with extraordinary diligence, lamenting, “Having been born a woman in this life, confined to secluded chambers, I shall never attain the Dao.” She thus maintained long fasts, upheld the precepts, and meditated ceaselessly, vowing to be reborn as a man. Her cinnabar heart reached far and moved the heavens, drawing the descent of perfected beings. At that time, the Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning sat beneath the Fusang tree in the Long Forest of the Langbi Stream upon the Fuyao Hills, with all the perfected in attendance.

On that day, Natai saw five-colored purple light curving to illuminate her chamber. Her heart stirred, sensing something extraordinary, and she went out to climb the wall and gaze in all directions. Suddenly, she beheld, hundreds of miles from her dwelling, the mouth of the Obstructing Yang Valley and the Vast Sea. Her heart leapt with joy, yet she had no means to reach it. She bowed in reverence from afar, calling out the name, saying, “My past karma was not profound, thus I was born a woman. Yet I have aroused the aspiration for joy, my will set upon becoming a divine immortal. The Dao is lofty, its methods wondrous—I cannot ascend to them. Day and night, I think only of liberation, of transforming this form into a man. For years, I have felt no response, ever fearing that I shall not escape the cycle of birth and death. Now, the course of my destined years has reached its end, yet the Celestial River still bars my way, and I have no means to present my case. Today, I shall cast myself into the Azure Sea, entrusting my life to the Ten Heavens, hoping my form and soul may swiftly attain the Wheel of Transformation. I shall establish merit and virtue anew, and in ten thousand kalpas, perhaps I may behold the true Dao.”

Having spoken, she leapt from the wall, casting herself into the void, her life plunging into the abyssal depths of the Vast Sea. Suddenly, she did not fall, for the Water Emperor and Divine Kings bore her body upon five-colored flying dragons. In an instant, she was transformed into a man within the suspended space, riding the dragon through the void to stand before the Dao. Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him an imperial title for the Fire Kalpa, commanding him to assist the Jade Writ of the Numinous Treasure Blue Emperor. After seven hundred years, when the Fire Kalpa reached its end and the Blue Qi began its course, he followed the Primordial Beginning into extinction. In the first year of the Kai-Guang Era, at the Flying Primordial Cloud Root Capital in the Nine Cloud Wilderness of the Cangxia, upon the Misty Peaks of the Mifan Lotus Terrace, the Primordial Beginning once more bestowed upon him the title of the First Venerable Lord of the Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove, the Blue Spirit.

The Dao speaks: The Vermilion Numinous True Venerable Lord of the Southern Flourishing Treasure, originally surnamed Zheng, styled Ren’an, was a descendant of the Great Flame. He was born in the Crimson Clarity Heaven of the Chanli World, his form enveloped in clouds of threefold qi from birth, with vermilion birds beating their wings above him. On the third day, he could speak and knew his past lives. By twelve, his face bore the golden countenance and jade complexion of an immortal. He then abandoned the world, leaving the mundane behind to wander distant mountains and forests. In the Cold Numinous Cavern Palace, he encountered Master Xuanhe, who bestowed upon Ren’an the *True Writ of the Five Qi Mystic Heavenly Qi Emperor of the Vermilion Script of the Numinous Treasure*, along with the Ten Precepts of the Supreme Wisdom, before departing.

Ren’an thus upheld the precepts with long fasts, performing great merit and virtue. He distributed treasures and alms, even cutting his own flesh to feed crows. His fame resounded through the heavens. Later, in the Zhouna Kingdom, he encountered the Heavenly Flood Catastrophe, where vast waters surged, drowning the people. Ren’an, upon the waves, floated in a boat reciting the precepts and the *True Writ of the Qi Emperor*, casting it into the waters. The waters parted, and a hundred acres of land became a refuge for birds and beasts—deer, tigers, leopards, and lions—all gathering in safety. At that time, the king and his hundred kin ascended a tower, yet were swept away, sighing in despair, unable to be saved. Seeing the king about to drown, Ren’an sailed toward him and presented the true writ he wore. The king reverently received it, and the floodwaters immediately receded. The king was spared, but the true writ then flew away, vanishing into the clouds, its whereabouts unknown.

Ren’an, having lost the true writ, descended one rank in immortality. His destined time of extinction arrived, and he entrusted his life to its end, dying in the northern Rong hills. His corpse lay exposed for over thirty years, yet his form did not decay, his radiance and color as vivid as in life. In the northern Rong, beneath the Long Forest, the king went hunting and set fire to the mountains, flames encircling all. Yet within a hundred paces of Ren’an’s corpse, the fire would not ignite. Deer, tigers, and leopards gathered around, and the king, astonished, went to see. Above the corpse shone three-colored light, clouds and mist swirling, birds and beasts—deer and stags—circling about. The king ordered firewood gathered to encircle the corpse and set it ablaze. Within the flames, the corpse rose, seated upon blue smoke, pointing to the void. Five-colored radiance blazed forth, and three hundred jade maidens and immortal youths appeared as attendants, solemnly arriving. All the creatures that had gathered around were also delivered. Ren’an, in the second year of the Crimson Clarity Era, in the bing-wu year, in the Heavenly Cavern of the Na-Mo-Tan-Lou-Yu-Wei, upon the Misty Peaks, changed his surname to Dongfu and was styled Jiyan.

The Conferral of the Southern Cinnabar Treasure at Changyang’s Elixir Numinosity, the True Venerable Sovereign

The Primordial Numinous Primordial Venerable Sovereign

The Dao declares: The Central Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Primordial Venerable Sovereign, originally surnamed Huang, styled Xinran, was of the lineage of the Cavernous Primordial and the progeny of Central Harmony. Born in the World of Good Endurance within the Azure Primordial Heaven, upon the Flowing Birth Mound, he endured an eon in silence, formless and unmoving, his heart in primordial chaos, sustaining himself on qi. Before heaven and earth shone with light, the Ageless Youth in the Realm of No-Form bestowed upon Xinran the *Numinous Treasure Red Writ of the Red Thearch*, a single scroll. From that time, he cultivated only his own person, never expanding his reach, and his vast merit of delivering heaven and humanity remained unfulfilled in its destined course. He then perished in the Azure Primordial Heaven, his life ending upon the Flowing Birth Continent. His corpse lay exposed beneath the barren hills for over a hundred years, yet it did not decay to ash. A constant yellow qi enveloped it. When the water kalpa swept through, the world was submerged in darkness. Earth surged up around the corpse on all sides, rising to the heavens and blocking the waterways.

Xinran, responding to transformation, arose in a flourish, reborn as a man. He changed his surname to Tongban and was styled Yuanshi. As the waters receded and the world shifted, heaven and earth shone with light, the Three Images gleamed brightly, and the Seven Primordials radiated brilliance. In the first year of the Kai-Ming Era, in the ji-chou year, within the Dragon Net Heaven’s Returned Soul Grove of the Lofty Peach and Stern Surge, the Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning conferred upon Yuanshi the title of Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Primordial Venerable Sovereign.

The Radiant Numinous Yellow Venerable Sovereign

The Dao declares: The Radiant Numinous Yellow Venerable Sovereign of the Western Seven Treasures Golden Gate was originally the offspring of the Numinous Phoenix. The Numinous Phoenix was born in the A-Luo Heaven within the Wei-Luo Grand Hall World. The king of Wei-Luo took and raised it. The king had an eldest daughter, styled Peiying, who cherished it deeply and often played with it. Thus, the Numinous Phoenix would constantly fan the girl’s face with its wings. After twelve years, the girl suddenly conceived. Three months later, the king, finding this strange, beheaded the phoenix and buried its head in the Long Forest Mound. Later, the girl gave birth to a daughter who, upon falling to the earth, could speak: “I am the child of the phoenix, destined to be the Heavenly Consort.” The king named her Imperial Consort. Three days after her birth, a flock of phoenixes arrived to celebrate, offering dark dew and jade frost, the winding springs of the vast abyss, and the eightfold refined mushrooms of immortality.

By the age of eight, she maintained a solemn and pure demeanor, rising above the common and transcending the vulgar. At dawn, she would pay homage to the sun; at dusk, she would bow to the moon. Within the layered palaces, the king prepared feasts, yet she found no taste in them. Heaven sent a great snow that did not melt for a year, piling ten zhang deep, and birds and beasts starved to death. The princess, longing for the Numinous Phoenix, went to visit its resting place. She rode to the Long Forest Mound and sighed, singing: “O distant Numinous Phoenix, everlastingly departed; my endless longing, forever unfulfilled. Through ten thousand kalpas, when will you return in flight?”

Then, the phoenix the king had slain arose in a flourish, embraced the girl, and together they flew directly into the clouds. The princess now resides above the Scenic Empyrean, receiving scriptures as the Supreme Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen, ever riding a nine-colored phoenix. In her past life, through ten thousand kalpas, she had already served the Numinous Treasure, causing the Numinous Phoenix to descend in form. Thus, she was enfeoffed with the title of Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen. The Imperial Consort’s virtue and power resounded far and wide, moving the celestial perfected to descend. In the geng-shen year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, at the hour of noon, the Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning convened at the Phoenix Unicorn Mound in the Jade Kingdom of Wei-Luo, beneath the blooming kalavinka tree, with the host of perfected in attendance.

At that time, within the chamber where the Imperial Consort resided, a solar image suddenly appeared, round as a mirror, suspended before her eyes. The Imperial Consort saw within it the great celestial perfected, all present in the mirror, and the chamber beneath the Long Forest shone with light. Thereupon, she ascended the Passage to Yang Terrace, gazing toward the west. She saw upon the Phoenix-Born Mound a mass of purple clouds surging, divine radiance blazing brilliantly—beyond description—some five hundred paces from where the Imperial Consort resided. Yet, confined by her womanly bounds and dwelling within the palace, she could not go forth.

Suddenly, a divine phoenix arrived, alighting upon the terrace. The Imperial Consort addressed the phoenix: “In the west lies the Dao, my heart’s desire, yet I have no means to reach it. Might the divine phoenix deign to carry me there, even for a moment?” The phoenix then spread its wings, allowing her to mount. With a single flight, they arrived before the Dao. The Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning pointed to the Golden Terrace Queen Mother, saying, “She is your teacher. You should pay her homage.” The Imperial Consort kowtowed and entreated: “I only hope that the assembled venerables will take pity and grant that this decayed form may be reborn.” Having spoken, the Queen Mother enfeoffed her with the title of Western Numinous Jade Consort and commanded the Nine Radiant Numinous Youths to unfold the Frost Net’s treasures, producing the *Numinous Treasure True Writ of the White Thearch*, a single scroll, which they bestowed upon the Imperial Consort. She received her title for three hundred years.

During the subsequent Azure Kalpa’s shift in destiny, the Imperial Consort was reborn within the womb of the Li clan. Two years later, in the Western Na-Yu Jade Kingdom, beneath a plum tree in the secluded valley of Golden Mound, she was born, her form transformed into a male. She changed her surname to Shangjin and was styled Richang. In the first year of the Kai-Guang Era, in the ren-shen year, the Primordial Beginning conferred upon him the title of Radiant Numinous Yellow Venerable Sovereign of the Western Seven Treasures Golden Gate.

The Five Numinous Mysterious Venerable Sovereign

The Dao declares: The Five Numinous Mysterious Venerable Sovereign of the Northern Cavernous Yin, Solitary Cinnabar, and Secluded Absolute was originally surnamed Hao, styled Fuming. He was of the lineage of the Mysterious August and the progeny of Great Purity. Born in the World of Primordial Blessing and Abandoned Worth within the Beginning Azure Heaven, by the age of twelve, he favored seclusion and delighted in mountains and waters. He wandered far from home, sometimes absent for ten days before returning once more.

At that time, the world suffered a great famine, and the people starved to death; the entire kingdom was nearly wiped out. Fuming, at the foot of the Earth Mirror Mountain, came upon a field of sesame as vast as a hundred mu. He personally gathered it and distributed it to the destitute, several times a day, saving thousands on the brink of death. The sesame regrew as he harvested it, and for three years, he did not return. Others went in search of him but could not find his whereabouts.

At that time, his toil was bitter, his body emaciated, and he had no leisure to care for himself, until exhaustion overcame him and he died beneath the mountain. The Nine Heavens recorded his merit and virtue, inscribing his jade name in golden registers. His soul was conveyed to the Scarlet Numinous Palace, and the Emperor dispatched a golden-winged great bird to spread its wings perpetually over his corpse. For seven hundred years, his body did not decay to ash. When the kalpa of water transformed the era, the floodwaters bore his corpse, drifting upon boundless waves.

After the waters receded, his corpse settled in the source of Beiwei Xieyuan, within the land of Chumo Tian Yu Shan in the state of Chu Dan. For forty years, it lay upon the Northern Mound of the Dark Hill. Then a great mountain fire raged, burning his corpse, yet within the flames, his body underwent refinement and arose, transforming and reborn as a man. A five-colored cloud enshrouded him above. In the first year of the Kai Ming era, upon the Northern Mound of the Dark Hill, he changed his surname to Jie, with the personal name Linghui. The Primordial Beginning bestowed upon Linghui the title of August Lord of the Five Numinous Ones of the Dark Northern Yu Shan in the Cavernous Yin of the Solitary Land.

The Dao speaks: The Venerable Deity of the Southern Culmen was originally surnamed Huang, with the personal name Duming. She was the daughter of King Wan of the Yanfu Li Kingdom. Born in the world of Chan Li within the Crimson Brightness Heaven, she was raised in wealth and nobility. As the king’s daughter, she dwelt within the palace, amid golden groves and jade couches, beneath seven-jeweled canopies. Twin pearls of luminous moon shone, illuminating all within and without. The king provided her with thousands of female musicians, and within the kingdom, treasures were never lacking. Yet she ever desired to distribute alms and establish great merit and virtue. Her heart yearned for mountains and waters, seeking divine transcendents, but confined within the palace, she found no path to escape. Restless and joyless, her heart was consumed by sorrow.

The king, moved by pity, comforted her in every way, inquiring after the cause of her distress. Yet she spoke not a word, her tears falling like rain, never once smiling. The king increased her musicians and entertainments, filling each day with song. Duming heard the music as though she heard it not, secluding herself in purity to burn incense, observing long fasts and upholding precepts, eating but once at midday. The king, perceiving her intent, constructed a mountain of pounded earth within the palace, a hundred *zhang* in height, planting bamboo groves upon it. Atop the mountain, he built a terrace named Seeking the Real. Duming abandoned the palace halls, ascending the terrace to dwell, blocking all roads and paths so that none might pass. Alone, she lodged in solitary shadow.

After twelve years, her accumulated sincerity moved the vast heavens. The Heavenly Emperor Lord dispatched twenty-four jade maidens of the Scarlet Palace, riding clouds and driving phoenixes, to descend and welcome Duming. On the evening of her departure, the heavens stirred a great wind and rain, thunder and lightning clashing fiercely, the earth’s dwellings trembling and turning. The entire palace was shaken, and the king, seized by terror, knew not what to do. At dawn...

At dawn, Chengguang lost sight of the mountain terrace and could no longer see the maiden’s form. The Emperor welcomed Duming upon the peaks of Yangqiu, lodging her in the cypress groves of Danling. Crimson phoenixes stood guard, divine dragons flanked her chariot, and over three hundred jade lads and maidens attended her.

The king, having lost his daughter, was overwhelmed with longing and resentment, refusing food for three days. Later, as the great kalpas turned and heaven and earth exchanged places, Duming was fated to be cast into the realm of abandonment. Yet her utmost sincerity moved the southern heavens, and the Scarlet Palace inscribed her purple name. Her form dissolved into the womb of the Unbegun, and after one kalpa, she was reborn as a male in the Upper Hall of the Southern Crimson Grotto. Amidst seven-jeweled forests of radiant hues, the Red Emperor, the Venerable Lord of the Flourishing Yang and the Cinnabar Spirit, bestowed upon Duming the title of Supreme Perfected of the Southern Culmen.

The Red Radiance Heavenly Emperor spoke of the Dao: "In the world of Chanli, there was once a King of the Que people who had a daughter named Guayin. From birth, she did not speak, and by fourteen, the king found this strange. He abandoned her in the empty mountains south of the Floating Mulberry of Nankuang. The girl, lacking sustenance, would face the sun to swallow qi and draw in the moon’s essence to fill herself, her body unharmed. She wandered the mountains endlessly until one day, she encountered a divine being in the cypress groves of Danling’s lodge. Taking her right hand, he inscribed upon a red stone, saying to Guayin: *Though you cannot speak, remember this.* Guayin lamented in her heart, resenting her ill-fated birth, her inability to speak, and her abandonment in the barren mountains. She vowed that if she could return among humankind, she would perform meritorious deeds without reservation. After a hundred kalpas, she hoped to fulfill her aspiration.

Heaven was moved by her sincerity and sent a divine lad of the Scarlet Palace to teach Guayin the arts of cultivating the body. He transmitted to her the eight red-script characters, and from then on, she could speak. Guayin paid homage to the celestial patterns morning and evening. Once the Perfected of the Dao descended, she could foresee fortune and misfortune, command the hundred spirits, and summon the ten directions. Emerging from the mountains, she returned to her kingdom.

At that time, the land suffered a great drought, and the people were reduced to gathering firewood. The king was seized with terror and prayed to the divine. Guayin approached the king, saying: *I have heard there is a mute girl in the mountains who can move heaven. Does the king recognize her?* The king then realized she was his daughter. He welcomed her back to the palace, and seeing her now able to speak, he was filled with shame. The girl revealed her Perfected Dao, and as the king gazed upward, heaven sent a torrential downpour, the waters rising ten *zhang*. Then she transformed her form, concealing her radiance, and departed. Later, she entrusted her form to the womb of the Hong clan. As the time for her rebirth had not yet come, she was again born a girl. Her father was named Fuqing, and he named her Aqiu.

She would light lamps and burn incense in seclusion, maintaining long fasts in a quiet chamber. Her cinnabar sincerity accumulated, moving the Dao to descend. In the year of Opening Radiance, the great sages and Perfected of the ten directions, along with the Wondrous Practitioners, gathered together in the Azure Flower Grove of the Three Primordials’ Grotto on the Crimson Huo slopes of the Southern Garden. A multitude of Perfected attended the assembly, fragrant blossoms and celestial music filled the air, and fifty million beings beheld the resplendent true scriptures, their luminosity penetrating within and without. Clouds and light blazed brilliantly like stars.

At sixteen, Qiu Zeng saw her dwelling suffused with radiance, illuminating all within and without, an extraordinary sight. She went out and faced south, where she beheld the Perfected of the Dao. Overjoyed, she bowed with her hands clasped and called out from afar: *Qiu Zeng! Today I am blessed to meet you and behold the Heavenly Venerable—an unmerited joy beyond words!* She prostrated herself before the heavens of the ten directions, hoping to receive the mysterious oversight and be granted the precepts, that after ten thousand kalpas she might attain the flight of immortality.

The demons, seeing Qiu Zeng’s great vow, feared she would transcend their realm. One assumed the guise of an elder of the Five Emperors and approached her, saying: *I am sent by the Venerable Gods of the ten directions to tell you: the Lingbao Dharma is now flourishing, and our Dao is spreading. They wish for you to cultivate benevolence, filial piety, and reverence for elders, honoring your parents. I hear your father intends to betroth you, and you have already accepted the proposal. The command of parents must not be disobeyed; you should comply first. Once the human way is fulfilled, you may then devote yourself to the Dao. To defy your father’s teaching would leave no path to immortality.*

Qiu Zeng replied to the demon: *In my past life, I was unfortunate to be born a woman. From dawn to dusk, I have striven with single-minded devotion. Though born of my parents, my destiny lies with the ten heavens. To defy my father’s teaching would be as you say, but I cannot comply.* Seeing Qiu Zeng’s resolute and upright heart, the demon retreated.

Qiu Zeng then gathered firewood, ascended the altar, and burned her body, hoping her form would be refined. As the flames rose, her ashes scattered like dust upon the wind, soaring before the Dao. In an instant, she was transformed into a man, standing before the Way.

The Primordial Beginning then commanded the Venerable God of the Southern Culmen to be Qiu Zeng’s master, transmitting to him the Ten Precepts and the Lingbao True Scriptures. The Primordial Beginning further instructed the Venerable God of the Southern Culmen: *In past lives across ten thousand kalpas, Qiu Zeng has already served the Lingbao, yet his merits were incomplete, leading him through the cycles of rebirth until today, when he was born among humankind. Now that he has encountered my revealed Dharma and transformed his form, he must further deliver others. After ninety-nine thousand nine hundred more, he shall attain true Perfection and become the Great God, the Radiant Yang of the Red Radiance Heavenly Emperor.*

**Songs of the Immortals**

The celestial net descends from Heaven’s records,
Nine Dipper’s jade-green void,
Purple canopy veils the layered peaks,
Mysterious essence illumines the eight corners.
Above dwell the Nine Morning Guests,
Chanting hidden feather-script,
Striding through the northern Han,
Abiding long between Heaven and Earth.

They rein in at the Dark Feather Terrace,
Soaring to the Nine Origins’ realm,
Where cavernous spirits dwell in profound depths,
Cloud-nets hang suspended in empty ascent.
Below stand the Gatherers of Truth,
Gazing upward to summon the Jade Dawn’s host.
Thrice circling the radiant Yang,
Ninefold returning to the cavern’s wilds,
They ascend in lofty steps to the August Honored One,
Singing the dragon-soaring hymn.

Jade clouds gleam over the northern wastes,
Jasper branches verdantly veil the slopes,
The Nine Numinous Terrace arises in emptiness,
Its luminous essence blazing with grand auroras.
Heaven’s gates turn through layered darkness,
Eons pass in repeated cycles.
Mounting my feathered chariot,
I stride the Weaving Maid’s River,
Preserving the numinous in constant transformation,
Forever forgetting the world’s vastness.

These three stanzas emerge from the Jade Purity Upper Palace. The Nine Yang Jade Chapters and Nine Radiance Jade Maidens ever chant them upon the Flowering Dawn, harmonizing the union of form and soul, awakening the numinous perfected within the hidden passes. For all who cultivate the Seven Origins’ flying steps and traverse the Nine Stars’ Way—without these song-chapters, none may presumptuously ascend the celestial net or tread the Dark Dipper.

*From the* Dongzhen Huiyuan Jiudao Jing *(Scripture of the Ninefold Return to the Origin from the Cavern of Perfection)*

The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed upon the Southern Culmen Lord of Life the *Seventy-Four Transformations of the Upper Clarity* within the Cloud Chamber. At that time, the Three Origins’ Overseer of Perfected Ones, the Upper Origin’s Wuying Emperor, sang the *Song of the Upper Origin’s Cavern Gate Transformation of Inner Perfection*:

Three purities flow through fivefold clouds,
Winding through the ninefold ridges,
Crimson numina open the azure chamber,
Golden radiance blazes in the eastern auroras.
Three dawns illumine the Grand Void,
Upper Clarity’s peaks rise steeply,
Jasper gates coil through winding halls,
Flying tiers interlace in uneven ranks.
Here stand the myriad emperors’ palaces,
Each true one dwelling in their own abode.
Primordial qi is fundamentally the Mysterious One,
Its transformations—what could be more numerous?
Bound in titles through a hundred charts,
Transformations sprout like roots and shoots.
Dispersing numina beyond the nine degrees,
Adorning countenance not with morning blossoms,
They firmly establish the ten-thousand-eon court,
Weaving splendor into a hundred-thousand kalpas’ branches.
The Southern Culmen opens the dark domains,
Wondrously transcending the world’s snares.
Violating prohibitions permits no concealment—
What can one do with frivolous concealments?

The Middle Origin’s Yellow Venerable Emperor sang the *Song of the Middle Origin’s Cavern Transformation of Inner Perfection*:

Lofty, the Three Perfected spread,
Dividing the ninefold numinous qi.
Jade Void arrays eight thrones,
Transformations wheel without trace or reach.
Bound in titles, the myriad emperors roam,
Their life’s work spanning boundless existence.
Jasper palaces tower amid grand auroras,
Golden light suffuses the cavern’s deep mists.
Jade terraces stand in the empyrean,
Flowing essence gleams beneath the purple canopy.
August ones occupy the numinous wastes,
Flying tiers flourish in the grand auroras.
Embracing truth within the Three Elixir Storehouses,
Dispersing numina beyond the nine bounds,
Qi transforms without beginning or end,
Swiftly responding to numinous convergences.
Who can fathom the dark transformations?
Turning countenance, they reverse old age.
The Southern Culmen inherits the dark phoenix,
Thus binding the central girdle.

The Lower Origin’s White Prime Emperor sang the *Song of the Lower Origin’s Cavern Void Transformation of Perfection*:

Towering, the grand aurora’s gates,
Golden portals coil through ninefold layers.
Cinnabar radiance illumines the jasper heavens,
Flying clouds press upon the dark vault.
Divine transformations leave no trace in the court,
True titles bear their original tracks.
Dispersing qi through the nine numinous doors,
Dividing into the myriad emperors’ palaces,
Each emperor has their own realm,
Each true one their own direction.
Silently arising above the auroras,
Obscurely within the Grand Void,
The wheel turns by its own motion,
Ten thousand eons make but one end.
Cavern transformations dwell in the cinnabar numinous grotto,
Vast and distant, the Nine Mysteries commune.
Dark contemplation carries the silent chamber,
Eight effulgences may soar through empty space.
Coiling through the land of transformations,
Wondrous indeed, the Primordial Lord!
The Southern Culmen’s earnest heart stirs,
Thus turning the spirit peaks.
Subtly treading the shifting effulgences,
They arise as the myriad immortals’ lineage.

*From the* Dongzhen Bianhua Qishisi Fang Jing *(Scripture of the Seventy-Four Transformations from the Cavern of Perfection)*

The August Jade Emperor commanded the Upper Palace’s Jade Maidens—Xu Farong, Xiao Huizhong, Tian Sifei, and Li Yunmen—to pluck the cloud zither’s strings, their voices harmonizing as they sang the *Chapters of the Grand Cavern’s Lofty Clarity and Mysterious Precepts*, and the *Poems of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings*:

The Grand Cavern encompasses the Three Bonds,
Primordial transformation holds form and formlessness.
Silent as the rootless teaching,
Yet Xiao and Cao wield numinous might.
Alas! Within the Three Paths,
Sorrow and suffering arise therefrom.
Those who master this precept,
Refine their goodness through kalpas’ ends.
When eons conclude, they are reborn in Heaven,
Their bodies joining sun and moon.
Foolish and deluded, they follow worldly fancies,
Pursuing shallow learning for vain glory.
Proclaiming transformation without discipline,
They lightly leak the Heavenly Treasures’ scriptures.
Their eyes’ karma enters the gates of death,
The Four Poles bind their names.
Soul and spirit tread the Nine Perils,
The Five Sufferings ever entangle them.
Feeding on fire, treading the Blade Mountains,
Their hardships know no moment’s peace.
Sighing at the origins of fortune and misfortune,
How clear they are amid the vast!
The Lofty One’s stern precepts,
Make men lament fortune and misfortune.
The immortal’s path depends on fate,
Yet in darkness, it is already decided.
Without fate, it will not unfold—
Once awakened, suffering is ever greatest.
If one can revere the Mysterious Teachings,
They will naturally transcend the empyrean.
But if they covet the burdens of prison,
Why forcefully seek amusement?
Dwelling in guilt, the Four Luminaries bind,
The dead soul treads the Nine Perils.
Dragged through the Five Sufferings’ courts,
The Three Paths’ bonds never dissolve.
The numinous sinks beneath the Nine Darks,
Ten thousand eons without dawn’s reprieve.
Grieving for the Primordial’s teachings,
How can one not sigh in sorrow?

Vast and distant, above the Nine Mysteries,
Obscurely at the dawn of transformation’s beginning.
Without form, without shadow,
Without depth, without measure.
The Two Modes initiate the unfolding,
Qi coalesces to form sediment.
Three dawns illumine the Primordial Chamber,
Five and nine establish the net’s records.
Fortune and misfortune arise from man,
Good and evil—who indeed decides?
If one can awaken to the Mysterious Teachings,
They will rise transcendent and lofty.
But if they wield the axe of life’s felling,
Transgressions accumulate within the heart’s earth.
Sinking in guilt, the Four Luminaries bind,
Ancestral punishments are truly deserved.
Born bearing the wind’s blades,
The Five Sufferings know no end.
Seven ancestors fill the dark night,
Ten thousand eons make but one reckoning.
Lingering in the Three Paths,
Unawakened to life and death.

*From the* Dongzhen Siji Mingke *(Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles from the Cavern of Perfection)*

**Nine Yang Songs**

Reining in the effulgences upon the dark steps,
Clarifying the true, feasting in Purple Clarity...

**Nine Yang Songs (continued)**

Crimson sleeves sweep the round firmament,
Dragon robes ascend the Great Clarity.
Unfurling reins beyond the lofty void,
Four Elders pass in brocade chariots.
Myriad immortals pay court to the Emperor’s chamber,
Incense smoke arises in the empty air.
Jade terraces array the Primal Ones,
Golden script awaits the Jade Court’s summons.
The Buddha ascends to celestial repose,
Bearing blossoms that radiate numinous splendor.
The body transcends countless kalpas,
The spirit secures peace through myriad ages.
Wandering light draws forth luminous brilliance,
Aligning with the sun’s awaiting decline.
Gossamer winds harness eight chariots,
Riding swiftly to gaze upon the Nine Heavens’ verge.
Tipping banners on the spirit’s summit,
Rosy peaks gird the sky’s expanse.
Hand in hand with the Western August One,
The Jade Dawn becomes my teacher.
Inhaling the pearl blossoms’ nectar,
I perceive the Luminous Pass unfurl.
Within the Tiger-skirted Jade Hall,
I soar with the Twin Effulgences.
Yoking my chariot from the Nine Mysteries,
The Golden Chamber stands serene and still.
Dragon carriages ride the Three Clouds,
Divine winds fan the flying mists.
Bathing in the Weaving Maiden’s River,
Feasting with the Lofty Primordial Ones.
Together we array the radiant dances,
Ever guests amid the void.
Wandering the Two Boundless Realms,
Inward vision entangles itself.
Beyond the Nine Rosy Mists,
Eternally preserving countless eons.
Evening lodged in the Western Flower Hall,
Each dawn with the Fusang Lord.
Vast and bright, gazing upon the Great Void,
The spirit’s path knows no round or square.
Purple reins gather the Five Clouds,
Parting the skies to tread the numinous winds.
Turning the chariot toward the Winding Mound,
Dragon coaches usher in the True August One.
To the left, the Vast Radiance’s worthy is recorded,
To the right, the Four Seas’ lads are summoned.
The numinous phoenix sings with golden flutes,
The spirit tiger arrays celestial bells.
Ever with the Mysterious Effulgence’s origin,
Roaming carefree amid the dawn’s rosy clouds.
Banners soar to fan the Broad Cold,
Swaying the Morning Star’s palace.
Purple brilliance streams with cascading light,
Nine rosy mists veil the vast heavens.
Morning enters the Hall of Rare Woods,
Evening feasts in the Crimson Subtle Chamber.
The Three Qi merge in soaring eaves,
Double pivots turn the divine winds.
Chanting dispels the demonic verses,
All four seats intone the numinous hymns.
Perched and settled beyond the kalpas,
Dwelling in form through ten thousand eons.
Resounding in the Grand Tenuity’s precincts,
Towering in the Nine Mysteries’ abode.
Within, the Hold-Fast-to-Quiet worthies,
Where flute notes still the dark depths.
To the west, the Six Ridge Masters,
Seeking radiance to converse at dawn.
Neither imperial guests nor flying immortals’ companions,
I transcend with feathered canopy,
Wandering the limpid islets.
Opening the void above the Eight Poles,
Lofty mists ascend with the light’s rise.
Reining the winds to the Three Heavens,
Forever feasting in the Mysterious Chamber.
The Northern Asterism knots the Vermilion Lodge,
Suspended like the Nine Void Peaks.
Flying chariots attend the Rosy Summit,
Dragon skirts brush the lofty effulgences.
Eight winds unfurl brocade carriages,
Six Qi issue from the Jade Well.
Resplendent, the round wheel blazes,
Five skies veil the radiant glow.
Resting without end through kalpas,
The empty reins know no leisurely stillness.
Urging the chariot through the Mysterious Desert,
Silken reins guide through the Hall of Rare Woods.
Subtle wonders meet the primal chaos,
Eternal fans stir the Five Mists.
Eight scenes halt the jade wheels,
Pure coaches behold the luminous true.
To the left, tread the flying journey,
To the right, gaze upon the Eight Heavens.
Vast and open, ascending the Harmonious Dawn,
Looking up to grasp the August Center’s hand.
Utterly at ease, the Mysterious Principle unites,
The numinous wondrous embodies the spirit’s treasure.
Morning feasts at the Southern Flower Gate,
Evening bows in the Jade Dawn’s court.
Tiny and still, the chariot amid quietude,
Eight scenes fan the cloud carriages.
The Mysterious Terrace knots the Nine Rosy Mists,
Crimson ranks descend the verdant essence.
Hidden mushrooms array the secluded steps,
Phoenix brains illumine the Five Cities.
The Three Origins’ coaches bear green banners,
Enduring winds display majestic radiance.
Above, they summon the void’s immortals,
Drawing me with the Vermilion Fire Bell.
Ten absolutes command myriad demons,
Forever preserving the qi’s harmonious arising.

True Persons’ hymns and verses,
In the Supreme Four-Flowered Palace,
And within the Mysterious Pass’ Jade Terrace,
Upon the Windy Mysterious Mound’s chambers,
Are sung by divine lads and maidens,
Also to instruct those destined for the Dao below,
That those who should become immortals may hear and chant them.

**Six Yin Songs**

Flying winds scatter the dark waves,
The azure billows begin at the radiant cliffs.
Linked waves tower like mountain peaks,
Abyssal surges surpass the Nine Heavens’ verge.
Transcending the drowning ford’s edge,
Rejoicing in the Heavenly Blade’s stream.
Flying billows ride the whirlwind,
Clouds and waters sprinkle the dark ladder.
Buoyantly ascending the Flower Lads,
Morning roaming the Four Directions’ terrace.
Turning light to the Grand Mystery’s consort,
Bearing sashes that entwine and bind.
Responding to the destiny’s grand assembly,
Summoning one another to hasten the appointed time.
Ten thousand kalpas form one pact,
A thousand eons never part.
Commanding the chariot from the Three Mysteries,
Drifting and flying through the Milky Way.
Guests of the August Great Harmony’s court,
Where Yu Yi gazes upon the Pure Void.
Knots of radiance beyond the smoky verge,
Seeking light where the Seven Voids blaze.
White dragons soar the Purple Heaven,
Wandering the Nameless Lodge without end.
Dragon banners turn the jade wheels,
Four luminaries scatter with the light.
For now, awaiting the time’s communion,
Warming until the Perfect Dao’s dawn.
The Two Mysteries transcend towering peaks,
The Jade Terrace’s wondrous waves gleam.
Nine Qi entwine the hidden mushrooms,
Ten thousand ages knot the trailing vines.
Vast and empty, the Primal Simplicity’s light,
Numinous brilliance illumines the dawn’s river.
Treading between the Two Mysteries,
Looking up to grasp the Round Essence’s motion.
Jade cinnabar offered to the divine true,
Years reckoned beyond countless kalpas.
At times veiled in the Nine Numinous Chamber,
Moving through the Two Revolutions’ change.
Morning feasts in the Effulgent Yang Palace,
Climbing radiance where virtue is concentrated.
Wandering the Double Mystery’s summit,
Fluttering, descending flying dragons.
Aligned beyond the Eight Falls,
Lofty steps in the Heavenly Gate’s chamber.
Scattering winds arise in the cinnabar room,
Clouds gather in the winding depths.
The leisurely realm refines the Standard Child,
Refining the pure in the vast heavens.
Eternal continuity holds the scene within,
Dragon mists gird the mountain’s visage.
Empty and absolute, the Broad Cold’s abode,
The utmost numinous and the Dao’s wonder unite.
Accumulating stillness, the Mysterious Eight Openings,
Silken mists veil the eternal thoroughfare.
I ascend within the Yang’s vastness,
Empty winds harness the divine winds.
Cloud terraces illumine the Northern Mystery,
Dragon springs plumb the secluded peaks.
Jade essences circle the dark ravines,
White blossoms crown the hollow summits.
Chewing the Dragon Chamber’s qi,
The spirit embryo endures the Nine Heavens.
The High Mystery fixes the golden script,
The Two Luminaries part the rosy tips.
Yoking the chariot within the Great Desert,
Vast and empty, attaining eternal stillness.
The Western Mystery’s roots are dense and deep,
Lofty radiance brushes the blazing light.
Tiny and distant, the flowing rosy mists clear,
Nurturing light to part the vast purity.
The chamber’s purity enfolds the Double Fire,
Serene wonders lodge in orchid’s birth.
Commanding the chariot to fly the Eight Scenes,
Fans gather as they turn toward the southern verge.
Soaring above the Yang’s brilliance,
Tigers roar in the Eight Poles’ city.
Though ten thousand miles seem distant,
A moment’s transcendence defies lingering spirits.

At the lofty assembly lies wondrous delight,
The upright chariot expounds its essence refined.
The Supreme Dao shines deep and luminous,
Wisdom arrives, warming the sutras of wisdom.

The Supreme Lord’s Perfected Eight Pure Spirit Yin and Three Harmonies Songs, six chapters in all,
Tune the Purple Sovereign’s Jade Consort and the Darkly Balanced Jade Pipes,
Settling the rhythms of their notes.
To the right: Yin Songs and Yang Songs,
Fifteen chapters in total.
The Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao commanded the Grand Simplicity Perfected,
the Hua Xia Noble Scion, and the Grand Culmen Purple Yang Duke Lu Xu to compose and sing the Eight Pure Perfected,
That those who chant them ceaselessly may cause their essence-spirit to merge with the music,
Their five spirits to harmonize,
And the myriad evils to be barred from entry.
The beauty of these songs—
The Grand Culmen Purple Yang Duke’s Yang Songs, nine chapters,
Illuminate the Dao of the Nine Dawns;
The Yin Songs, six chapters,
Benefit the essence of the Six Qi.
Those who chant them concentrate the Three Spirits,
Those who possess them dispel misfortune.

From *The Supreme Perfected’s Eight Pure Yang Songs, Nine Chapters*

The Orthodox Unity Perfected addressed Zhao Sheng, saying:
“The Nine Heavens’ Thearchs commanded the Plain Girl to compose the Yin Songs, nine chapters,
To harmonize with the Yang Songs.
Scholars who practice the Dao recite and chant them.
Eastward they roam the peaks of Penglai,
Westward they cross the Nine Rivers’ ford.
Flying Sanskrit ascends to the void above,
Shaking forth radiance upon the heavens.”

Amidst the flowering groves they rest and roam,
What fear of failing to attain long years?
Northward they wander to the isles of sea,
Southward they tread the forest’s wild frontier.
Lush verdure glows in double-bright array,
Crimson phoenix leads her fledglings’ cry.
Once worldly glory’s bonds are cast aside,
Why not treasure the immortal’s dwelling high?

The Yin Songs resound in sorrowful refrain,
Chanted by the lofty immortals’ choir.
Roaming free on Song Peak’s soaring heights,
They rise through emptiness to heaven’s sphere.
The Eight Tones’ hymns in measured cadence flow,
Subtle wonders waft upon the breeze.
Wandering the limpid woods they pause to share
Verses with the sages, hand in hand they go.

The Eight Tones in solemn chant ascend,
Gentle winds bear the sacred hymn aloft.
In tranquil night a plaintive song takes flight,
Twin Yin melodies in harmony arise.
The weaving maid pours forth her homeward lay,
A poignant sorrow stirs the heart’s deep core.
If not a lofty immortal, how could one
Preserve the true and wise forevermore?

In the distant Spirit Dawn’s celestial grove,
Immortals soar to reach the Mystic Garden’s height.
The Nine and Five cannot be held for long,
Why covet then the Eight Tones’ fleeting sound?
The Five Notes of palace and zither mourn,
Only the Nine Yang’s gaze can bring delight.
First one hears the lonely soul’s lament,
Then finds no joy in the secluded mystery’s door.

The Mystic Sanskrit soars to empty skies,
Resplendent, beckoning the exalted spirits on.
Fear only the lack of steadfast resolve,
Not that the heart may fail in purity.
Once entered in the Cavern Chamber’s void,
What worry that the Dao may not be won?

Majestic stands the Imperial Culmen’s hall,
Resplendent gleam the Jade Grove’s radiant bowers.
Flying rosy clouds descend in streaming light,
Twin luminaries reveal their jade-like grace.
The phoenix bears the sacred script in beak,
Chanting aloud to gladden primal power.
Wandering visions waft the Sanskrit breath,
Flying songs pause with the Jade Perfected’s presence.

The Yin Songs’ subtle recitation flows,
The Western Melody enters the Two Ease.
Yang Songs harmonize with Yin’s response,
Twin dances whirl in graceful, fluttering flight.
Abandon now the journey of worldly fame,
Let lofty immortals bind our kinship true.
Carefree, what realm do we traverse now?
Entering and exiting the Gates of Myriad Wonders’ door.

Jade Capital showers forth compassion’s grace,
Golden Towers spread their boundless favor wide.
Following to the Tortoise Mountain’s lodge,
Singing, laughing in the Fusang’s sacred grove.
Long abiding in the Great One’s dwelling,
Returning life to bow before the Three Honored Ones.

From *The Scripture of the Three Sovereigns*

Dragon banners dance in the Great Void,
Flying wheels course the Five Peaks’ slopes.
Wherever they roam, all is carefree,
Stirred by feeling, they raise dark hymns.
Non-reliance surpasses reliance,
Yet through encounter, harmony is found.
Why deem the Canglang’s waters too remote?
The Mystic Well is not deemed overfull.

In dense seclusion, step by step they seek,
All converging within the Four Seas’ net.
How could it compare to beyond the Radiant’s edge,
Where three kalpas pass but once?
Swiftly they depart from Western Flower,
Between non-reliance and reliance’s span.
Now gazing at the Five Peaks’ summits high,
Now leaping the Celestial River’s ford.

Releasing the wheel, they seek the empty boat,
Wherever they go, all is bound in bliss.
A mustard seed suddenly becomes ten thousand acres,
Within it lies Mount Penglai’s height.
Small and great are fundamentally not distinct,
Far and near share the selfsame bond.
They act as reliance comes,
I act in non-reliance’s sight.

In the Ninth Flower’s Peaceful Consort’s song,
According to *Declarations of the Perfected*,
Within non-reliance’s Great Non-Being,
Reliance’s vast expanse has bounds.
Small and great are waves upon one sea,
Far and near converge in one meeting’s tide.
Plucking strings on the Mystic Dawn’s peak,
Golden flutes conduct the Eight Qi’s flow.
Why not revel in the spirit’s wine,
Gaze with joy upon the Nine Clans’ pride?

Being and non-being attain the Mystic’s turn,
The two reliances thus interlace.
From *The Song of the Azure Lad of Square Vessel*,
The Perfected of Southern Peak’s Great Void sings:

Riding the whirlwind, fanning the Great Void,
Eight Sceneries soar in lofty clarity.
Above, they float beyond the Purple Dawn,
Below, they gaze upon the abyss’s end.
The Mystic Heart dwells in the empty cavern’s midst,
Above and below, no drifting, no pause.
Within the two reliances’ bounds,
Reliance has no place to strive.

Embodying non-being, one can die,
Embodying being, one preserves life.
Eastward they gather for the lofty chant,
Why dispute the two reliances’ worth?

From *The Song of the Central Candidate Lady*,
The Purple Prime Lady’s song:

Mystic resonance lies beyond all forms,
Harmonious sounds arise from principle’s own call.
Spirit clouds gather in the Purple Dawn,
Orchid winds fan the green-tasseled carriage’s way.
The Highest Perfected feast in Jade Terrace’s halls,
Far removed, they stand as earthly immortals’ mark.
What they seek is noble, far-reaching advance,
Thus they flourish, surpassing all in grace.

Delighting in those Eight Pure Scripts,
The Dao’s attainment was never far.
How can worldly affairs be foreseen?
They cause your form and qi to fade away.

From *The Scripture of True Traces*

The Four Perfected descended to the Southern Peak’s Lady.
Thereupon, the Perfected of the Grand Culmen intoned *The Song of Fanning the Void*:

Cinnabar radiance blazes in Highest Clarity,
Eight Winds stir the Great Rosy Clouds.
Turning my Spirit Dawn’s chariot around,
I arrive at the Jade Ridge’s slopes.
Alas! Beyond heaven and earth,
The Nine Enclosures are all my home.
Above, I gather the sun’s midst essence,
Below, I drink the Yellow Moon’s bloom.

In the spirit’s vision, emptiness alone,
The Peng’s path knows no idle evil.
Glancing back, I see Wei Xian’an,
Turbid qi harms your harmony.
Diligently refine the Mystic’s thoughts,
Once the Dao is attained, we’ll meet again.

Next, the Azure Lad of Square Vessel sang:

Great Rosy Clouds fan the spirit’s splendor,
Nine Qi have no constant form.
Mystic reins fly beyond the dawn,
Eight Sceneries ride in lofty clarity.
Holding the Jade Thearch’s sleeves,
They bear me to be born in the dawn’s midst.
Gazing upon the Seven Luminaries’ chambers,
Bright and clear, yet also dark and deep.

Surpassing! O son of the Wei clan,
You have both heart and feeling.
Mystic excellence arises from joyous meeting,
Your name inscribed in Golden Script on Eastern Flower.
Xian’an, what you secretly refine,
We pledge to meet at Yang Luo’s banks.

Next, the Divine King of Fusang sang:

At dawn, the Grand Thearch’s hall is opened,
Leaping beyond the Gourd’s waters wide.
The Azure Sea’s jade waves take flight,
Linked peaks stand tall as mountains’ height.
Floating wheels amid the cloudy waves,
Nine Dragons rise together, reins held tight.
Tiger banners glow at Rosy Ford,
Spirit winds unfurl in ordered might.

Hua Cun has long delighted in the Dao,
Thus attaining the lofty spirits’ likeness.
Uprooted and moved beyond the Three Bonds,
The meeting of resonance now begins.
We pledge to meet at Yang Luo’s palace,
Once the Dao is attained, to bear Wei’s son away.

Next, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness sang:

Swiftly driving, controlling Pure Emptiness,
They linger in the Western Flower’s lodge.
Jade wheels turn as dawn’s last light,
Tiger banners disperse in misty haze.
Kind winds stir the cinnabar pennants,
Bright torches illumine the Eightfold Radiance.
Loosening robes within the wall’s embrace,
Divine bells chime with sparkling grace.

Dwelling in light like forest branches,
Nine strings plucked within the Mystic’s core.
They lift from me the sorrows of a thousand ages,
Release the sighs of a thousand years.
Joyful gazes know no end,
Through the night, they await the dawn.

He sang again:

Amidst purple haze, the mystic void whirls,
Divine winds know no ridge’s bound.
In an instant, the Nine Realms are filled,
Dazzling, the vast emptiness opens—serene.
The Eight Windows shine without constancy,
Now dark, now bright, in shifting glow.
Gazing through the Three Cinnabar Fields,
Silent, still—form and shadow arise.
Mind congeals within the Mud-Pill Palace,
How radiant the Purple Chamber gleams!
The Supreme Emperor commands my coming,
As if answering a divine summons.
I meet my sister-disciples,
Their cloud-borne grace, their carriage poised and bright.
Ashamed, like jade cut by a master’s hand,
I refine their innate brilliance yet more.
Lush and dense, the Way of Nurturing Life,
Dissolving knots of calamity and blight.
The sacred tryst has its appointed hour,
Hand in hand, we ride forth together.

Thereupon, the Lady received the investiture rites in full. Then the Queen Mother of the West, the Saintly Lord of the Golden Portal, the Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen, the Lady of the Ninefold Subtlety, the Queen Mother of Tortoise Mountain, the Three Primordial Ladies Feng Shuang, Li Zhu, and Zi Yang, the Left Immortal Duke Shi Lucheng, the High Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate Yan Gai, and the Noble Scion—all lingered in divine revelry the livelong day, discoursing on stillness and delving into the formless. The Perfected of the Upper Realms circled in radiant flight, their feathered canopies askew. Each commanded her attendant maidens to array the tuned melodies, golden and stone instruments resounding, a tumult of voices rising. Phoenix flutes swirled on the wind, simurghs sang with chiming jade, the Nine Clouds kept time, the Eight Sounds scattered in splendor.

Then the White Queen Mother rose, pacing as she stood, bending low to intone. Her brocade sleeves gathered the dawn, her cloud-skirt rode the void. Tinkling pendants flashed and gleamed, her sash and girdle hung with luminous jade. At her left hip, the Dragon Script; at her right, the Tiger Seal. Her form composed, her bearing graceful, her four limbs at ease—she struck the rhythm and sang:

I mount my Eightfold Radiance chariot,
Swiftly ascending into Jade Clarity.
Dragon skirts sweep the celestial vault,
Tiger banners command the crimson hosts.

At the carefree bounds of the Mystic Ford,
the myriad streams never pause for a moment.
Alas, these partings and meetings—
when kalpas end, heaven and earth collapse.
One must seek the scene within the Void,
where there is neither death nor birth.
Embodying that natural Dao,
in silent contemplation merge with the Great Obscurity.

The Southern Marchmount towers with true essence,
its jade luster gleaming with keen spirit.
Those who bear no burdens in their affairs
receive the numinous in the emptiness of their hearts.
Within the Crimson Mound’s joyous gathering,
together we delight without end.

The Three Primordials’ Ladies—Feng Shuang, Li Zhu, and Ziyang—plucked their cloud-lutes and sang in reply:

From Jade Clarity beyond the Nine Heavens,
the divine halls soar beyond the flying rosy clouds.
The cloud-terrace gleams, towering and grand,
the numinous summer luxuriant with verdant splendor.
Five-colored clouds rise with emerald radiance,
the Eight Winds stir the green qi.
Gazing upward, they chant to dissolve demonic songs;
bending low, they study wisdom and insight.
The myriad perfected ones unfurl the dawn’s light,
singing of the Crimson Chamber’s assembly.
The virtuous child of resonant power stands forth,
her divine radiance soars on high.
The Celestial Marchmount ascends in empty construction,
the cloud-terrace deeply secluded and profound.
Roaming the sea, one awakens to the well’s narrowness;
treading the real, one perceives the world’s filth.
Dancing wheels feast in the layered chambers,
the fish-trap and fish naturally fade away.
I turn to the great *chun* net,
forever parting from the ephemeral world of morning-born beings.

---

From the *Scripture of the Dao’s Traces*:

The Most High Sage Thearch,
at the inception of the Ninefold Mystery’s qi,
when the void and numinous first divided,
ascended to the nine-tiered, sevenfold-luminous Crimson Palace.
He wandered above the bright rosy clouds,
in the desolate vastness of the Nine Emptinesses.
The Western Consort struck the rhythm,
heavenly maidens arrayed their chimes.
Dragons roared, tigers blew,
simurghs danced, phoenixes sang.
The Four Perfected joined in song,
the Eight Sounds harmonized in unison.
The cloud-zithers rang out clearly,
shaking the Three Clarities with their overwhelming splendor.

---

From the *Seven Saints’ Primordial Record of the Wondrous and True*:

The Supreme Clarity’s Western Radiance Purple Consort and the Queen Mother of the West
each commanded their attendant maiden Wang Tingxian of Broad Splendor and others
to pluck the cloud-jade zithers.
They also commanded the attendant maiden Andeyin Fan Quzhu
to strike the Kunming jars.
They further commanded the attendant maiden Zuobaorong Han Longbin
to blow the phoenix and simurgh flutes.
And they commanded the attendant maidens Zhao Yunzi and Li Qingyu
to tap the flowing-gold stones.

---

From the *Declarations of the Perfected*:

The Lady of the Southern Culmen said:
The lesser Shangxian immortals of the Fangzhu often play the Nine Numinous Flutes for their own amusement.
Those who can play them are heard forty *li* away.
The flutes have thirty holes,
are two or three *chi* in length,
and when nine flutes play together,
the hundred beasts dance in joy,
and phoenixes and birds come to harmonize with the sound.

---

From the *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*:

The Queen Mother of the West performed music for Mao Ying,
commanding her attendant maiden Wang Shanghua
to play the Eight Jade Zithers.
She also commanded the attendant maiden Dong Shuangcheng
to blow the cloud-harmony reed pipes.
She further commanded the attendant maiden Shi Gongzi
to strike the Kunting bells.
And she commanded the attendant maiden Xu Feiqiong
to beat the quaking-numinous jade chimes.
She also commanded the attendant maiden Wan Jueqing
to tap the Wuling stones.
She further commanded the attendant maiden Fan Chengjun
to strike the cavern-yin chime-stones.
And she commanded the attendant maiden Duan Anxiang
to perform the intricate melodies of the *chanbian*.
Then all the sounds blended together,
the numinous music startling the heavens.
The Queen Mother commanded her attendant maidens Yu Shanbin and Li Longsun
to sing the *Mystic Cloud* melody, whose lyrics say:

Though the Great Image may seem desolate,
I grasp the gate of the Nine Heavens.
Parting the clouds, I float on the Eight Radiances,
in an instant descending to the lower earth.

The Great Emperor intones the *Fu Palace* melody—
who could fathom the bitterness of wind and dust?
The Perfected Lady of Supreme Truth, Wang,
at times plays the zither herself.
Her zither has but one string yet yields the five notes,
its lofty tones resounding for miles around.
All the birds gather in the grotto-chambers,
circling and soaring, driven away yet unwilling to depart—
surely this is the music of heaven and humankind,
the wondrous sound of spontaneity.

The Four Perfected descend to the quiet chamber of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount,
where they receive her and inquire about the constricted affairs of the mortal world,
the laws governing women’s governance.
Though she is called a lofty spirit,
there is nothing she has not thoroughly examined.
Thus, their discourse and feast proceed in rough outline.
The Four Perfected chant and sing,
and the Perfected of the Great Ultimate first commands
Song Dexiao, the Jade Maiden of the Northern Frigid Realm,
to play the *Nine Qi* zither.
Next, the Azure Lad of the Fangzhu commands
Yan Jingzhu, the Jade Maiden of the Eastern Florescence,
to strike the bell of the Western Fullness.
The Spirit-King of Fusang’s Yang Valley further commands
Jia Quting, the Jade Maiden of Cloud Forest,
to blow the phoenix-cry xiao.
The Perfected of Pure Emptiness then commands
Xianyu Lingjin, the Jade Maiden of Flying Mystery,
to tap the *Ninefold Jade Rhythm*.

*(From the* Dao Ji Jing*)*

The Most High Dao Lord observes a pure fast and upholds the precepts
in the Jade Realm of Xina, atop the Floating Gauze Peak of Yucha Mountain.
The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning rides the *Eightfold Radiance Jade Chariot*,
borne by the *Threefold Simplicity Flying Clouds*,
adorned with a jade wheel and feathered canopy,
its five-colored effulgence of blossoming light.
Divine winds and dark drums resound,
distant dances unfurl their banners,
jade groves tremble with echoes,
jade branches stir the flutes,
cloud-songs soar through the void,
phoenixes cry in the great mystery,
heavenly harmonies ring clear,
myriad sounds converge in wild harmony.
Divine consorts join in chorus,
while the host of immortals sway in graceful procession.

The Celestial Worthy further commands
the Jade Maiden of Flying Mystery from the Golden Numinous Upper Palace of the Western Florescence,
the Perfected of the Radiant August,
to play the *Fivefold Harmony* zither.
The *Cloud Dragon Jade Zither* is strummed,
the *Nine Phoenix* xiao is blown,
the *Divine Continent* sheng is sounded.
The heavens each perform their divine dragon arts and music,
an innumerable throng.

*(From the* Dongxuan Kongdong Lingzhang*)*

**Section on the Governance of the Orthodox Unity *Qi***

On the seventh day of the first month of the second year of Han’an in the reign of the Supreme, at midday, the Twenty-Four Governances descended—eight upper, eight middle, and eight lower—corresponding to the twenty-four *qi* of Heaven and the twenty-eight lunar lodgings, bestowed upon Celestial Master Zhang Daoling to uphold and propagate.

On the seventh day of the seventh month of the first year of Shanghuang, the Supreme Great Dao Lord Lao established the eight upper-grade governances:
Yangping Governance, corresponding above to the Horn Mansion, governing within the Shu Commandery.
Lutang Governance, corresponding above to the Neck Mansion, governing upon the Upper Immortal Terrace, an ancient site of transcendence. Formerly, in the first year of Yongshou, the Supreme Lord Lao led Celestial Master Zhang here, where he governed alongside the Four Garrisons, the Grand General of the Year Star, and the hundred spirits of river shrines. Together, they split stone to make covenants, all submitting to the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might.
Heming Mountain Governance, corresponding above to the Root Mansion, its mountain connected to the Celestial Stronghold Mountain of Qingcheng. It is also said that Master Yin presides here, also within the Shu Commandery.
Liyuan Mountain Governance, corresponding above to the Chamber Mansion, connected to Lutang Mountain, above which lies the Shu Commandery.
Gegui Mountain Governance, corresponding above to the Heart Mansion, connected to Liyuan Mountain, above which stands Xiangli Mountain, also within the Shu Commandery.
Gengchu Governance, corresponding above to the Tail Mansion, its mountain rising three hundred and ninety *chi* above the plain. At times, immortals come and go here, where one may transcend calamity and nurture nature. Formerly, this was where Zhang Lishi attained the Dao. The mountain contains two stone chambers and three dragon heads, within the Guanghan region.
Qinzhong Governance, corresponding above to the Winnowing Basket Mansion. Formerly, Han Zhong attained transcendence upon this mountain, within the Guanghan Commandery.
Zhenduo Governance, corresponding above to the Dipper Mansion. Its mountain rises two hundred and eighty *zhang*, upon which grow divine mushrooms and numinous herbs, also within the Guanghan Commandery.

On the fifth day of the tenth month of the first year of Wuji, the Orthodox True Non-Ultimate Supreme established the eight middle governances...

Changli Governance, corresponding above to the Ox Mansion. Formerly, this was where Li Babai first studied the Dao, wandering among the famous mountains of Shu. Daily, he would appear at play in the Chengdu marketplace at sunrise and lodge upon Mount Qingcheng by dusk. To the south of the mountain lies a stone chamber, before which stand three Dragon Gates, also within the Guanghan Commandery.

Lishang Governance, corresponding above to the Woman Mansion. Formerly, Master Li Zi studied the Dao and attained flying transcendence here. The mountain contains two stone chambers and a divine spring, where white deer, white turtledoves, and white swans come at times to drink, also within the Guanghan Commandery.

Yongquan Governance, corresponding above to the Emptiness Mansion. Formerly, Ma Mingsheng studied the Dao and attained transcendence here. The Supreme Lord Lao came to this place, transforming his form to visit this governance. Above it lies a spring whose waters cure the illnesses of the myriad people without fail. Later generations transmitted this as "incantation water." The governance lies within the Suining Commandery.

Chougeng Governance, corresponding above to the Rooftop Mansion. The governance lies nine *li* from the Min Mountain and Jiang River. The mountain rises one thousand seven hundred *zhang* above the plain. Formerly, this was where the Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, studied the Dao. The mountains and ridges to the left and right of this governance are all connected in succession. To the northwest of the mountain flows the Mo River, and the mountain also bears divine mushrooms and numinous herbs, within the Qianwei Commandery.

Beiping Governance, corresponding above to the House Mansion. Upon the mountain lies a pool. The mountain spans two hundred *bu* in length and breadth, and within it grow divine mushrooms and numinous herbs. Formerly, this was where Wang Ziqiao attained transcendence, also within the Qianwei Commandery.

Benzhu Governance, corresponding above to the Wall Mansion. The mountain rises one thousand three hundred *zhang*, upon which lies a stream. To the north of the governance stands a fragrant grove, and a dragon cavern with an earthen passage connects to Mount Emei. Formerly, this was where Guo Zi attained the Dao, also within the Qianwei Commandery.

Mengqin Governance, corresponding above to the Straddler Mansion. The mountain rises one thousand *zhang*. Formerly, Yi Yin studied the Dao upon this mountain, where grow golden-fluid mushrooms and herbs of immortality. Those who consume them transcend the world, within the Yuexi Commandery.

Pinggai Governance, corresponding above to the Harvester Mansion. At the foot of the mountain stands a jade figure, thirteen *chi* in height. Formerly, Cui Xiaotong of Wu Commandery studied the Dao upon this mountain and attained flying transcendence, also within the Qianwei Commandery.

On the seventh day of the first month of the second year of Wuji Shanghuang, the Primordial Dao Lord, Mysterious Elder, established the eight lower governances:

Yuntai Governance, corresponding above to the Stomach Mansion. Formerly, Celestial Master Zhang, leading three hundred seventy disciples, resided upon this mountain governance. After two years of teaching and transformation, they ascended to heaven in broad daylight. One year later, the Celestial Master’s wife also ascended to heaven. This is the very place where Zhao Sheng plucked the peaches, within the Baxi Commandery.

Jinkou Governance, corresponding above to the Pleiades Mansion. Formerly, Chen Anshi studied the Dao upon this mountain and attained transcendence. The mountain is also called Mount Pingyuan, within the Hanzhong Commandery.

Thus, it was named Yuju Governance, to the left of the south gate of Chengdu.

Beimang Governance, corresponding above to the Willow Mansion. Formerly, Wucheng Zi studied immortality upon this mountain and attained the Dao, within the Jingzhao Commandery.

On the seventh day of the seventh month of the first year of Han’an, the Celestial Master established the twenty-four governances, entrusting them to his successor to correspond with the twenty-eight mansions.

Baishi Governance, on Mount Xuanji, corresponding to the Extended Net Mansion.
Jushan Governance, on Mount Fanyang, corresponding to the Wings Mansion.

**Scroll Twenty-Three of *The Supreme Secret Essentials* concludes.**
**Scroll Twenty-Four of *The Supreme Secret Essentials*: The Three Treasures**

The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Great Cavern.
The Heavenly Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Heavenly Treasure Lord.
The Elder is the qi of the Primal Jade Sovereign of the Chaos of Undifferentiated Great Nonbeing—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine hundred million qi. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was transformed into being. At the time of revealing the scriptures, he was titled the Supreme Great Possessor of the Jade Clarity Palace.

The Numinous Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Cavern Mystery.
The Numinous Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Numinous Treasure Lord.
The Elder is the qi of the Primal Jade Void of the Crimson Chaos of Undifferentiated Great Nonbeing—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine myriad qi. Later, in the era of the Dragon Han’s unfolding chart, the Numinous Treasure Lord was transformed into being. After one kalpa, in the first year of the Crimson Brightness era, at the time of revealing the scriptures to deliver humankind, he was titled the Jade Capital of the Seven Treasures of the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Upper Clarity Mystic Metropolis.

The Divine Treasure Lord is the august deity of the Cavern Spirit.
The Divine Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Divine Treasure Lord.
The Elder is the qi of the Primal Jade Void of the Profound Stillness and Mystic Pervasion—nine myriad, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety myriad qi. Later, in the first year of the Crimson Brightness era, the Divine Treasure Lord was transformed into being. After two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign era, at the time of revealing the scriptures, he was titled the Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Palace of the Three Sovereigns’ Cavern Spirit.

Though these three titles differ in name and era, their root is one and the same. They divide into the Three Qi of the Mysterious Primordial to govern the Three Treasures, all being the august deities of the Three Qi.

The above is from *The Cavern Mystery Scripture of the Nine Heavens*.

---

The Three Treasures are: first, the Treasure of the Dao; second, the Treasure of the Most High Scriptures; third, the Treasure of the Dharma Masters.
It is also said that the Three Venerables are: first, the Venerable Dao; second, the Venerable Most High Scriptures; third, the Venerable Dharma Masters.

The above is from *The Cavern Mystery Scripture of Petition and Inquiry*.

---

I possess Three Treasures, which I safeguard and uphold.
The first is compassion; the second, frugality; the third, not daring to be foremost in the world.
Through compassion, one may be courageous; through frugality, one may be expansive; through not daring to be foremost in the world, one may become the chief of vessels.
Now, to abandon compassion yet seek courage, to abandon frugality yet seek expanse, to abandon the rear yet seek the fore—this is death.
Through compassion, one prevails in battle and stands firm in defense. Heaven will deliver him, shielding him with compassion.

The above is from *The Scripture of Virtue of Laozi*.

**The True Writ**

**The True Writ**

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was seated in the Cypress Mound Lodge within the Crimson Clarity World, beneath the Long Mulberry in the Fragrant Garden, together with the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, the Host of Boundless Perfected Ones, and the Assembly of Noble Elders. As the Heavenly Worthy turned his divine carriage, the hosts of heaven descended from their seats. Then clouds and mists surged thickly, the four quarters darkened and merged, and for three days and nights the profound yin did not disperse. Heaven and earth were without light, as in the time before the Dragon Han, deep and obscure.

The Five Venerable Thearchs advanced and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Today, as we attend your seat, we have never before witnessed such a phenomenon when the Heavenly Worthy sets forth. When you journey forth, the hosts of heaven empty their carriages; the Perfected Ones of the Highest Realms, the Divine Immortals, Jade Maidens, sun, moon, and stars, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the officials of the Three Realms, the divine immortals of the Five Peaks, the water thearchs of rivers and seas—all spirits and numina without exception—stand in solemn reverence, awaiting the Perfected Ones. The heavens become bright and the qi pure; winds do not stir the branches; the earth is without flying dust; rivers and seas are still and silent; mountains and peaks conceal their mists. The seasons are harmonious, the qi settled; the living and the dead rejoice together. Yet now the celestial radiance is veiled, and bright day turns to gloom. Heavenly beings are filled with dread—we know not the reason. Since this has come to pass, we humbly beseech your instruction, that all present may be enlightened and all universally attain peace."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Today, as we sit together in joy—a rare encounter—the heavens manifest auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. The jade script shines resplendently, obscuring the celestial light. At the inception of the unmanifest, the beginning is plunged into darkness. Such a convergence of time and felicity is seldom seen. Now I shall universally reveal the wondrous celestial portent for the four assemblies, to deliver all beings. Let all here present close their eyes and prostrate upon the ground."

Thereupon, the assembly of Great Saints simultaneously closed their eyes and prostrated, awaiting the command. In an instant, the celestial qi cleared, the gloom vanished, and a five-colored radiance illumined the five directions. Suddenly, a celestial writ appeared in the empty void above, its characters a full *zhang* in size, emerging naturally within the five-colored light. Its resplendent patterns gleamed, its eight corners trailing rays of brilliance, their dazzling radiance overwhelming the eyes, making it impossible to gaze directly upon.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies: "This numinous script of the Eight Gatherings has no fixed form; its purport is profound and subtle, difficult to fathom in detail. Since heaven has sent down this response, the wondrous Dao should be made manifest. Let brushes be taken up to transcribe its true sounds, that the imperial Dao may flow freely and its blessings extend to the ten directions."

The Heavenly Perfected, the August One, bowed his head in reverence and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Through the revolutions of birth and death, traversing countless kalpas, though I have often attended your seat, never before have I encountered such a day—when I have chanced upon the sagely Dao, the opening of the scriptures of all dharmas, and beheld the celestial writ arising naturally, the most true. This is the qi of the Eight Gatherings, harmonizing the sounds of the Five Accords. My foolish sentiments and shallow thoughts cannot fully comprehend it. Now, having been seated in this assembly and witnessed these profound mysteries, I have received your command in trepidation. I dare not conceal my feelings, though I tremble in fear. Lacking divine guardianship, I shall exhaust my understanding to transcribe its sounds, hoping that even one in ten thousand may accord, revealing to future generations what they have not yet attained. I humbly beseech your compassionate indulgence." Thereupon, he took up his brush.

The Supreme Perfected brushed the mat; Jade Maidens held the cloth; Golden Lads wafted incense; maidens of the Moon Palace scattered flowers; essences of the sun sprinkled nectar; the Five Venerable Ones supervised the trial; the Three Realms guarded the Perfected.

The Heavenly Perfected, the August One, declared: "The celestial writ’s jade characters condense the soaring and mysterious qi to form the numinous script, harmonizing the Eight Gatherings into sound and the Five Accords into chapters. When the great cycle begins its course, the jade-like sounds arise spontaneously. The divine qi plays in emptiness; the Shao music resounds through the void. It shines above the various heavens, illumining the depths of the Great Obscurity. Together with the Dragon Han, it transforms; unfolding the Crimson Clarity in the era of Yan Kang. It refines water and fire through life and death, enduring through countless kalpas. It opens the Eight Level Paths in the subtle and minute, planting the dew-like radiance in the Great Yang. The Two Modes await it to divide; the Three Luminaries rely upon it to distinguish. The Supreme Saints ride it to the formless; the Five Peaks treasure it for its numinosity. All beings receive qi through it; kingdoms enjoy peace through it. Vast is its great model; majestic is its lofty honor. From being it gives rise to non-being, becoming the root of heaven and earth. Those who attain it do not die; those who uphold it endure forever. Those who treasure it receive the descent of the Perfected; those who cultivate it become divine immortals. It delivers the corpses from the long night, refining the living souls in the Vermilion Palace. This wondrous transformative script emerges from spontaneity, exalted above the Great Void, the ancestor of the ten thousand thearchs. Its majestic numinosity is vast and boundless—difficult to name."

The Heavenly Perfected, the August One, continued: "The great Brahma’s hidden language, the sound of the boundless, arises from the soaring and mysterious qi of heaven, harmonizing the five tones to form it. The boundless cavernous chapters of heaven expound the profound mysteries of the various heavens, praising the opening of the Great Existence. They govern the qi of spontaneity, universally delivering those who study immortality, rescuing the lives of the living and the dead, drawing forth the souls from the long night. The wondrous dharma of the Primordial Beginning endures through countless kalpas. Its sounds are clear, and its Dao flows forth. The great dharma is revealed, and the various heavens rejoice."

The Boundless Great Saints, the Host of Perfected Ones, the Assembly of Noble Elders, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Venerable Spirits of the Ten Directions, the Divine Immortals, and the Jade Maidens all circumambulated thrice while offering incense and intoned the following ode:

The Heavenly Worthy turns his jade carriage,
Descending to his seat in the Fragrant Garden.
The Perfected Ones, the Great Saints,
The Boundless Kings of Heaven.
Divine immortals guide the sun and moon,
Majestically unfolding the cloud palaces.
The Five Thearchs flank the radiant axle;
The Three Realms encompass the ten directions.
This day’s felicity at the assembly of Perfected Ones—
Joy unmatched.
The wondrous convergence arises spontaneously,
Numinous portents emerge from the empty void.
Resplendent, it inaugurates the obscure epoch,
Veiling the light of sun and moon.
The profound yin persists through the night;
The four assemblies stand in reverence.
The numinous destiny unfolds as ordained—
Suddenly the vast heavens brighten.
The celestial writ of the Eight Gatherings,
Its five tones harmonized into chapters.
The Heavenly Perfected deciphers its wondrous rhymes,
Resounding through the Great Existence.
The jade sounds defy comparison,
Universally accomplishing heaven and earth’s work.
Above, it plants the roots of the various heavens;
Vast and majestic, the ancestor of divine immortals.

In the midst, the Mystic Grotto-Palace unfolds,
Spacious, the Eight Secluded Chambers lie open.
It opens the path through life and death’s decree,
Drawing forth the Lords of the Long Night.
The Five Torments of hell dissolve,
Blades of the Mountain of Knives lose their edge.
The Five Paths’ original counterparts to souls,
Through kalpas uncounted, all become youthful once more.

Majestic, the Great Vehicle’s transformation,
Its merit universal, without partiality.
The Heavenly Venerable reveals the Great Existence,
Vast and resplendent, the myriad heavens brighten.
Wondrous, the Dragon-Han Dao,
The Eight Gatherings coalesce into form.
Radiant, it soars within the void,
Its streaming light illumines the Three Realms’ courts.

The divine chart unfolds the numinous assembly,
The jade script responds to the scene and arises.
Heavenly Perfected Ones commune with wondrous essence,
The Five Harmonies conjoin to form the scripture.
Resonant, the jade tones ring,
Floating, they ascend to the Highest Clarity.
It opens the path through endless kalpas,
The Nine Dark Realms receive illumination.

Towering, the Great Dharma Gate,
Instructing all living beings.
Its merit boundless,
Joy and felicity celebrate ten thousand ages.

At this time, beneficent grace flows universally,
Blessings shower the ten directions.
Those who believe and turn toward the deathless
All attain long years.
The aged revert to youth,
The sick instantly recover.
Withered bones quicken with qi,
Dead souls return to the living.
The Five Torments are wholly dissolved,
Hell’s chambers grow tranquil and still.
All who harbor intent
Attain the divine immortals’ way.

The Heavenly Venerable addresses the Four Assemblies of Perfected Ones:
“Today, within this kalpa of shared assembly,
The celestial mysteries of the spontaneous jade script are revealed,
Delivering all people.
Its blessings vast and universal,
Profusely benefiting all beings.
The Great Dharma now refined,
Grace rains without exception.
The boundless worlds
All receive illumination.
The Nine Dark Realms open in pardon,
The Long Night’s souls are absolved.
The living rejoice,
The dead are restored.
All heavenly and mortal beings,
Karmic bonds of kin—
Be they male or female,
Roots of good and evil fate,
From beginningless time to this present life,
Revolving through birth and death,
Calamitous bonds entwined—
Heaven and earth’s rise and fall,
Merit and transgression hard to discern.
Now, in accord with the Great Pardon,
A universal proclamation is issued to all heavens.

The sun, moon, and stellar lodgings,
The Jade Armillary and the Balancing Beam,
The Southern and Northern Dippers,
The Controllers of Life and Death,
The Lord Han who presides over records,
The Southern Prosperity Earth Palace,
All earths and waters,
The Five Marchmounts and numinous mountains,
The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,
The Twelve River Sources,
The Long Night’s palaces,
Within the Nine Dark Realms,
The Four Controllers and Five Thearchs,
All divine spirits—
Examine the registers and ledgers,
Trace and verify the original roots.
Whether without good or evil,
The roots of weight and light,
Distinctions of life and death,
Itemized names and listed words—
All are erased,
Karmic bonds severed.
Universally united in celebration,
From this day made new.
Within this kalpa,
All attain the Perfected Dao.
The vast blessings universally bestowed,
Let none be left aside.
By the Heavenly Venerable’s command,
All heavens reverently comply.”

Thereupon, the Four Assemblies rise as one to bow,
Raising hands toward the above,
Pointing hands toward the below—
No above, no below,
No bound, no end,
No depth, no distance,
No seclusion, no concealment,
No great, no small,
No number, no termination.
All universally delivered,
Together receive illumination.

With a snap of the fingers, the assembly is addressed,
All hear as one.
At that moment, the Four Assemblies simultaneously raise their hands,
Bowing their heads toward heaven in reverence.
The thirty-two heavens’ sun, moon, and stellar lodgings
All brighten at once.
Beneath the earth, to the Nine Dark Realms’ boundless depths,
Light and radiance penetrate completely,
No more darkness or obscurity,
All hidden realms universally revealed,
Earth’s treasuries laid bare.

Mountains, rivers, streams, and ravines
All become level and smooth.
Winter blossoms bear fruit,
Withered trees burst into bloom.
Joy bestowed upon all,
Merit borne by all beings.
Fish and dragons leap and surge,
Birds and beasts rejoice and sing.
Numinous songs converge,
No sorrowful cries upon the roads.
Heaven stills, earth silences,
The Three Palaces grow hushed and tranquil.
Judgments and retributions cease,
The Five Paths no longer arise.
Humans and spirits rejoice in peace,
The sagely Dao attains great harmony.

Excerpted from *The Inner Sounds of the Various Heavens in the Cavernous Mystery*

The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s Five Chapters of Vermilion Script
Arose within the primordial void before the Primordial Beginning,
Before heaven and earth took root,
Before sun and moon shone,
Dim and obscure,
Without ancestor or lineage.
The numinous script flickered,
Now present, now absent.
The Two Modes awaited it to divide,
The Great Yang awaited it to shine.
The divine chart transformed the course of destiny,
The mysterious signs shifted and changed.
Riding the moment, responding to the convergence,
Therein it abided.

Heaven and earth received it and divided,
The Three Luminaries received it and radiated light.
The numinous script flourished,
Illuminating the Highest Clarity.
Issuing from the Heaven of Primordial Azure,
Its color unbounded by direction.
The script’s patterns curved and turned,
Beyond tracing or fathoming.

The Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavernous Yang’s halls,
Forged it in the flowing fire’s courts,
Purified its true script,
Polishing it to emit radiance.
The Cavernous Yang’s qi was vermilion,
Thus it is called the Vermilion Script.
The divine chart now resplendent,
The myriad thearchs pay homage to the Perfected.
Soaring through the void,
They circumambulate the upper palaces.
Burning incense and scattering flowers,
Reciting the numinous chapters—
At that time, twelve mysterious portents descended from heaven,
Twenty-four responses emerged from earth.
Above, they celebrated the Nine Heavens’ numinous mysteries,
Extolled the Three Heavens’ precious illumination.
The divine winds stirred,
The imperial Dao flourished.

The Primordial Beginning issued the command,
The Great Perfected held the brush,
The Jade Consort smoothed the mat,
Forging gold into tablets,
Inscribing jade chapters.
The Five Elders recorded them,
Sealing them within the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital Palace.
Jade maidens tended the incense,
Great Splendor held the cloth.
Jade lads stood in attendance,
Jade steps led to the audience hall.
The Nine Heavens’ script
Was not for ghosts or spirits to hear.
Heaven treasured it to attain floating,
Earth concealed it to attain stability.
The Five Thearchs guarded it to secure peace,
The Three Luminaries rode it to attain brilliance.
Supreme sages revered it to attain the Perfected,
The Five Marchmounts followed it to attain numinosity.
The Son of Heaven obtained it to attain governance,
The kingdom’s destiny enjoyed it to attain great peace.
Truly the numinous script’s wondrous power,
Marking heaven and earth’s mysterious root.
Its majestic numinosity vast and boundless,
Universally bestowed without end.
Vast and expansive, the great transformation,
The ancestor of divine luminaries.
Its measure unfathomable,
Towering, the Great Void.

The above is excerpted from *The Scripture of the Vermilion Writ of the Cavernous Mystery*.

**The Nine Empyreans turn the heavens; white slips and blue registers.**

The Supreme Sage Lord received it from the Nine Voids.
He wove the soaring Dark-Purple Qi into characters of spontaneity—
the Mystic Register wherein later disciples inscribe their names upon attaining the Dao.
Their numinous tones harmonize, their jade clarity receives the truth.
Some manifest as written forms, some as hidden sounds.
Above and below, the four gatherings all reveal the Mystic Name.

In the Hall of Vast Numinosity, the Void-Born inscribed the scripture—
the old text comprised one hundred thousand five-character lines.
Its graphs lacked fixed forms, its rhymes lacked fixed sounds;
none but the Supreme Sages could fathom its meaning.
After seven thousand years, it was inscribed upon the chamber of Kunlun,
the source of the Northern Cavern.
Each character measured a zhang square, its patterns resplendent and radiant.
The four gatherings trailed luminous rays, born of emptiness in dim brilliance—
now present, now absent.
Flowing light and Purple Qi swept away its defilements;
golden essence smelted and refined its patterns.
Through kalpas uncounted, the characters remained vivid and bright.

In the first year of the Middle August, on the seventh day of the ninth month,
the Seven Sages, in unison of spirit, purified their palace with fasting.
They swore solemn vows to Azure Heaven, kneeling in reverent devotion.
Receiving the Numinous Text, the Most High resolved its obscurities;
the Seven Sages penetrated its wondrous tones.
It was recorded as the *Chapter of Attaining the Dao in the Nine Empyreans of the Vast Heavens*,
inscribed upon slips of white silver, bound with soaring azure script.
Enclosed in a cloud-brocade pouch, sealed with the Seal of Destiny’s Summons,
it was entrusted to the Five Elders of the Immortal Metropolis,
where the Left Duke safeguards its register in the Jade Palace.

The Most High declared:
*“Gather the Three Treasures into wondrous script,
weave the Three Qi into a sublime talisman.
Its marvels are unfathomable, its heights unreachable,
its depths unplumbed—how majestic and subtle,
such is the virtue of this Jade Chapter!
If you can devote yourself to its contemplation,
you shall ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.
The Way of Undying culminates in this Numinous Text.”*

Excerpted from *The Primal Record of the Seven Sages of the Cavernous Truth*, “Auspicious Omens”

At the dawn of the Primordial Chart, the Most High revealed the Twelve Numinous Portents:

First, when there was neither Heaven nor Earth, in the profound obscurity of primordial darkness, the Numinous Script glimmered unseen, without origin or ancestor. The revolutions of fate unfolded of themselves, becoming the root of the myriad qi. From the emptiness, truth congealed; the qi, pure and lofty, clarified into the vast expanse of Heaven, suddenly and mysteriously self-arising.

Second, when the Two Modes divided the frame, the flowing qi condensed below, unfolding the foundation of the Earth, all forms taking shape at once.

Third, when the thirty-six thousand suns and moons shone as one, illuminating all Heavens, no hidden place remained unpenetrated.

Fourth, when the Supreme Sages, the Great Spirits, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, and the innumerable hosts paid homage in the Jade Court, circling through the Great Void, they extolled and chanted the Numinous Script.

Fifth, when Heaven spontaneously produced music and dance, a hundred thousand myriad kinds arose as one, their radiant tones resounding through the cloud-palaces to celebrate the divine Perfected.

Sixth, when the numinous winds sang in a hundred voices, filling the ten directions of space, the harmonies of gong and shang merged into the Cavernous Chapters.

Seventh, when the celestial pivot halted and the stellar lodges ceased their motion, Heaven knew neither day nor night, and the four seasons dawned as one.

Eighth, when purple clouds exhaled their splendor, suffusing all Heavens, every being in the myriad realms was bathed in light.

Ninth, when spring, autumn, winter, and summer brought neither scorching heat nor freezing cold, the four qi harmonized in gentle balance, and all that was withered and decayed revived.

Tenth, when the Five Marchmounts stood firm, the talismanic charts and scriptures unfolded as one, manifesting the boundless mystery of the Daoist teachings.

Eleventh, when the seven treasures of the Mysterious Below scattered across the lands, they sustained the multitudes of the people.

Twelfth, when the wondrous forests of the seven treasures spontaneously arose in the void, their radiance and shade extended to cover the Ten Heavens.

Excerpted from *The Cavernous Mystery Scripture of the Vermilion Writ*, “Earthly Responses”

The Twenty-Four Earthly Responses of the Vermilion Writ’s True Scripture to Celebrate the Divine Perfected

First, when the primordial heavens were in chaos, devoid of light, the morning cock heralded the dawn, the four seasons attained mysterious clarity, the heavens brightened, the earth unfolded, and the Five Phases came into being.

Second, when thirty-six thousand suns and moons above and below shone as one, their radiance pierced the darkest nights without end.

Third, when the Azure Bird bore a missive to inform the Five Thearchs, the celestial divisions were rightly measured.

Fourth, when the White Tiger spewed forth gold, the Five Spirits were pacified and secured.

Fifth, when the Azure Dragon presented the talisman to announce the Water Thearch, the rhythms of time were regulated, and rivers and seas opened wide.

Sixth, when the Jade Phoenix bore the imperial seal to offer to the sovereign, the state was stabilized, the throne preserved, and the Five Marchmounts endured forever.

Seventh, when the simurghs cried and phoenixes sang, their soaring melodies resounded in harmony.

Eighth, when flocks of birds soared and danced, they rejoiced at the summit of the heavens.

Ninth, when dragons leapt and cavorted, they stirred the deep abysses and marshes.

Tenth, when the waters of the Yellow River stilled, fish scales interlocked in assembly.

Eleventh, when sweet dew arose of itself and magic mushrooms flourished in abundance.

Twelfth, when winter brought no frost, withered trees bloomed as one.

Thirteenth, when forests, crops, and grains bore flowers and fruit in both winter and summer, their yield was lush and plentiful, untouched by blight or decay.

Fourteenth, when the four qi harmonized, calamities and epidemics ceased, heaven and humanity rejoiced, and none met untimely death.

Fifteenth, when venomous creatures sealed their fangs, no harmful intent arose.

Sixteenth, when lions and fierce beasts dwelt as neighbors to humankind.

Seventeenth, when the blind, deaf, lame, and afflicted throughout the world simultaneously regained their forms, free from injury or illness, all attained health and vigor.

Eighteenth, when the aged reverted to youth and the young never aged, their countenances flourished with radiant splendor.

Nineteenth, when birds, beasts, and the six domestic animals conceived and bore young, all—whether already born or yet unborn—were nurtured, none harmed or lost.

Twentieth, when women with child throughout the world gave birth to sons.

Twenty-first, when the earth’s treasuries released their stores, gold and jade lay exposed, scattered across the roads, none hidden or concealed.

Twenty-second, when heaven quaked and earth split, withered bones revived, sunken corpses and wandering souls universally rose as living beings, and the world sang in celebration of great peace.

Twenty-third, when the earth sprouted lotus blossoms, heaven and humanity rejoiced, all exulting without exception.

Twenty-fourth, when the Five Marchmounts opened wide, talismanic scriptures emerged in unison to instruct heaven and humanity.

At that time, none who studied failed to ascend as immortals.

These twelve numinous portents and twenty-four responses above praise the divine precincts of the Primordial Beginning and delight in the enlightenment of the Five Elders. Once the numinous writ resounded, the Dao spread forth. Heaven and earth unfolded, the true Dharma flourished, the divine wind spread afar, and the myriad qi diffused their essences. The Five Thearchs lent their aid, marshaling celestial immortals, commanding spirit officials, and guiding the movements of yin and yang. They rooted the Three Luminaries in the Mysterious Origin, preserving heaven and earth for eternal endurance. They secured the Five Marchmounts within the Numinous Abode, governing the kalpic rhythms at the Three Passes. They established the state’s destiny in accord with the charts, guided the five qi to nurture the people, and broadly propagated the Primordial Heaven’s teachings to instruct the ten directions. Their majestic power expanded boundlessly, illuminating even the most hidden realms. Such divine marvels, resplendent and grand, defy full description.

**Essential Methods of the Three Sovereigns**

**Heavenly Sovereign’s Scripture:**
It is said: "That which constitutes the Qian is the essence of pure yang. The sun and moon hang forth their light, and the twenty-eight constellations." Whoever knows this scripture shall stand alongside me.

The first essential is to seek longevity;
The second essential is to seek concealment of form;
The third essential is to shun worldly glory.
Only by comprehending these three essentials can the Dao be perfected.

Through longevity, one may wander upon Mount Hua;
Through concealment of the body, one’s celestial stipend is assured;
By forsaking glory and renouncing emolument, heaven bestows gold and jade.
Should one wish to withdraw and enter the deep mountains, one must recite the *Inner Scripture of the Heavenly Sovereign*—only then will success be certain.

The Yellow Emperor said: **Earthly Sovereign’s Scripture** gives birth to the myriad things, nurturing all without exception. A household possessing this scripture shall be foremost in wealth and honor. It is the foundation for seeking immortality and practicing austerities, the mother of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, all of which the earth receives. It encompasses the impure and hidden, serving as the lord of soil.

The Yellow Emperor said: **Human Sovereign’s Scripture** encompasses knowledge of life-and-death registers, the names of the hundred ghosts, and the appellations of the myriad spirits—these are the great celestial graphs of the Three Sovereigns. The Yellow Emperor obtained the divine charts and celestial graphs, thereby knowing the names of the Nine Heavens’ sacred mountains and rivers. If one can summon the various spirits according to this scripture, one may attain longevity, command the Registrar of Life to erase one’s name from the ledger of death, and have one’s obstacles removed. Only then, through cultivating the Dao and seeking arts, can one assuredly become a divine immortal.

Should one desire to ascend as an immortal, one must sever yin and yang—only then may one seek an audience with the Jade Maidens. If unable to ascend as an immortal or sever yin and yang, one may still summon the Plain Maiden to serve as one’s guide and assistant. When pacing in circles, if one perceives a figure resembling a human form and hears the sound of zither music, it is she. Thereafter, one shall surely enjoy an extended lifespan of over three hundred years.

This earthly record of celestial graphs must not be transmitted recklessly. If one wishes to pass it to descendants, one must first fast and meditate for seven days, ensuring no misfortune befalls the body—only then may it be transmitted within the family. To ascend as an immortal, one must seek this scripture. By cultivating it, the true essence of all arts arises from the Sovereign’s Dao, firmly establishing Qian and Kun. From the Nine Heavens downward, the spirits of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways may all be consulted regarding fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty. Perform it with solemnity, treating even minor matters with reverence. One must not act arrogantly or carelessly, lest one harm oneself. Should one summon recklessly, the sin shall extend to one’s ancestors.

The celestial graphs state: Those who wish to summon the Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, Three Rivers, Four Seas, Supreme Unity’s Northern Lord, the sun and moon, the various spirits, the Five Thearchs, the Father-Mother Ladies, the various maidens, the recording clerks, the inspectors of transgressions, and the officials of prohibitions—all must do so according to this method. In times of illness, when pestilence spreads, or when official matters press urgently, this may be employed.

1. The first thirty graphs are the seal-script of the Nine Heavens; they must not be carelessly invoked. They may summon the Nine Heavens’ inspectors of transgressions. In cases of illness, they may be invoked.

**Methods of the Heavenly Sovereign’s Scripture, First Section**

1. The first eighteen graphs summon the Heavenly Thearch to rescue from urgent peril. Write them in crimson on fine silk, inscribing a *gen* trigram above, and place them in a propitious location. Face west, cross your hands, and hold your breath for fifty exhalations—the Heavenly Thearch will surely appear. Do not be afraid; proceed calmly. Should you have an urgent affliction and request aid, you will assuredly be delivered.
2. The next eighteen graphs summon the celestial spirits to rescue from criminal punishment. If one is to be punished according to the law, invoking this method will ensure auspiciousness.
3. The next nineteen graphs summon the Most High. If a household suffers grave illness or has offended the celestial spirits, and the afflicted cannot discern their malady—if they sense heaviness in the four limbs—summon the Most High and request aid, facing north as in the above method; it shall be auspicious.
4. The next seventeen graphs summon the Lord of the Supreme Unity. If a household seeks high promotion in office or rank, yet their desires remain unfulfilled for years, summon the Supreme Unity to request advancement. Write in black and white on black silk, inscribing a circle two *chi* in diameter, and face north as in the above method. The Supreme Unity will surely entrust the Registrar of Emoluments to bestow office and rank.
5. The next eighteen graphs summon the Northern Lord. If one fears water-related calamity or suffers from water-borne illness, invoke as in the Supreme Unity’s method—the Northern Lord will surely come. State your request as instructed, and you shall be free from harm. If one merely inscribes these graphs of the Northern Lord on one’s clothing, one may sail ten thousand *li* without wind or waves, and the boat shall not sink; this may be tested.
6. The next ten graphs summon the Registrar of Life. If a household faces urgency or one’s lifespan is exhausted and illness is dire, write the graphs on paper, face southeast, and place them on the ground. Prepare a five-colored silk ribbon, five *fen* in width and two *chi* in length, and place it before the paper. After a moment, the Registrar of Life will surely come. State your request, and it shall be auspicious.
7. The next fourteen graphs summon the Registrar of Emoluments.

If one seeks to ascend as an immortal and summon the Traveling Kitchen, inscribe the graphs on green silk, two *chi* in diameter, facing northeast, following the Celestial Theft’s method—then the Registrar of Emoluments will surely come. To invoke the Celestial Emoluments and Traveling Kitchen, avoid the mundane world and ascend as an immortal, purify oneself through fasting, and after a hundred days, the Traveling Kitchen will surely arrive, and one shall ascend as an immortal. For those who have not obtained rank or emoluments, seeking them shall surely yield results.

8. The next twenty graphs summon the Registrar of Perils. If a household suffers discord, quarrels, mutual suspicion, or internal and external strife, write these graphs on paper, inscribe them on a day of harmony, and summon on a day of union—then the Registrar of Perils will surely come to reconcile, ensuring the household knows no affliction, the state knows no suffering, and all shall be as one, surely auspicious.

9. The next three graphs summon the Celestial Chancellor. Inscribe them on silk, nine *cun* in diameter, and place them on auspicious ground. If one has violated celestial patterns or seeks unfulfilled wishes, perform this method to summon the Chancellor, and one’s desires shall surely be granted.

10. The next thirteen graphs summon the Six Dings. If a household suffers from malevolent illnesses, oppressive nightmares, ghostly afflictions, stabbing pains in the heart and abdomen, or corpse influences entering the viscera, inscribe this method on paper to summon the Six Dings and inquire of them. The Six Dings shall bow their heads and treat the affliction. They shall gather all local spirits, and the outcome shall be auspicious.

11. The next twelve graphs summon the Sun and Moon Generals. If a household has members suddenly deaf or blind, inscribe these graphs and place them in the sunlight by day and moonlight by night—do not act when there is no sun or moon. The Sun and Moon Generals shall come to inquire, and they shall surely cure the affliction.

12. The next eleven graphs summon Feilian. If a household has young children suddenly ill or suffering from chronic ailments, inscribe this method on paper, face west, and summon to inquire—they shall surely recover.

**Earth Sovereign’s Writ, Second Method**
1. The next eleven graphs summon the Earth Lord. If a household suffers from jaundice or bodily swelling, or wishes to break ground, inscribe this method on yellow cloth, two *chi* in diameter, using ink. The Earth Lord shall soon come to respond to the inquiry—then it shall be auspicious.

2. The next eighteen graphs summon the Earth Spirit Lord. If a household has violated the earth spirit, or another household’s earth spirit is present, or one wishes to relocate or fell the spirit tree, inscribe this method on paper, face west, and the Earth Spirit Lord shall soon come to issue commands—then it shall be auspicious.

3. The next five graphs summon the Registrar of the Yin. If a household suffers from hidden yin illnesses or others plot in secret against them, inscribe this method on paper to summon the Registrar of the Yin and inquire—then it shall be auspicious.

5. The next sixty-two graphs summon the Recorders of the Nine Heavens. They command the erasure of death registers and the removal of death records. The remaining graphs are recorded in the celestial patterns.

**Inner Sounds of the Three Sovereigns**
The Vermilion Talisman of the Azure Womb is received from the Queen Mother of the West by the Nine Heavenly Parents. On the first day of the greater month, one swallows the red script; on the first day of the lesser month, one swallows the qi script. Both require fasting, burning incense, and performing rites beforehand. Once ingested, they prevent hunger, replenish essence, fortify the brain, lighten the body, enhance beauty, and extend life without end. Daoists who have not seen this text and practice qi refinement in vain endure hardship for naught.

**Inner Talisman for Deploying the Nine Heavens’ Forces**
Derived from the seventieth graph of the Human Sovereign. Only with this talisman may one tame tigers, wolves, leopards, and beasts. Daoists entering mountains without it will find ferocious creatures unafraid, even attacking them.

**Inner Sounds Talisman of the Golden Light**
Derived from the sixty-fifth graph of the Heavenly Sovereign. It marks the beginning of the Dao’s qi, the essence of stars, and the primal breath of the Five Planets, the essence of gold and jade. When qi enters the body and essence penetrates the bones, one becomes like gold and jade, the body like the stars. Daoists who consume elixirs without swallowing this talisman will never attain immortality.

**Inner Talisman of Soaring Celestial Waters**
Derived from the ninety-third graph of the Great Script. The Central Heaven has a fixed cycle: once every three thousand years, a great flood arises. Daoists listed in the immortal registers who lack this talisman cannot pass through. During a great flood, wearing this talisman on the head allows entry into sacred mountains. The spirits of rivers, lakes, and mountains will open the path, ensuring passage through peril. It is ingested once yearly. On a *renzi* day, inscribe it in ink, consume it with water on a one-foot square of paper, and write "great flood" with the cyclical sign *zi* within it. Upon crossing the waters, remove it.

**Great Contract for Ascending to Heaven as an Immortal**
Derived from the sixty-eighth graph of the Human Sovereign. This contract is received alongside the seal. Without receiving the Great Contract of the Three Heavens, one cannot command the Three Officials of Water or the spirits of mountains, rivers, and lands, who will not fear them. If one acts without proper authority, misfortune will rebound. The twelve hundred chapters cannot be enacted without the contract; even possessing it, one cannot act without proper reception.

**Secret Texts of the Three Sovereigns’ Inner Writings**
The foremost technique of immortals is to summon the ten thousand spirits. When the ten thousand spirits obey, the method of summoning is as follows: inscribe cinnabar on white silk, fast, and invoke them. Face north, spread the text upon the ground, and wear the *Nine Heavens’ Talisman for Deploying Forces*. Within the time it takes to eat a meal, the ten thousand spirits will arrive—ghosts and spirits will come from behind, while the gods will approach from the front. At that moment, one’s mind will naturally comprehend.

**Transmitted Writings of the Three Sovereigns**
Daoists without these transmitted writings will not meet immortals.

**Yin Talismans of the Five Marchmounts**
Also called the *Scripture of the Colored Heaven’s Womb*. Those who possess the charts of the Five Marchmounts but lack these yin talismans will not receive the protection of the five spirits dispatched by the Marchmounts.

**Talisman of the Supreme Lord’s Eternal Abidance**
Derived from the celestial patterns in the middle chapter of the Supreme Lord’s scripture. On the eight seasonal nodes, inscribe it in cinnabar at dawn and ingest it. After three years of practice, the Supreme Lord’s Venerable One will erase one’s name from the death registers and elevate it to the *Register of Eternal Abidance*. Daoists without this talisman who merely study the Dao will still not escape death.

**Talisman of the Lower Chapter of the Great Script**
Daoists who seek myriad blessings and wish to meet immortals, or desire to know fortune and misfortune, may inscribe it in cinnabar on a three-inch square and swallow it. Lie down in stillness, and the next day’s fortunes or misfortunes will be known.

**Summoning the Supreme Name**
Invoke the Supreme Great Harmony, and within the time it takes to eat a meal, its form will appear.

**Summoning the Heavenly Sovereign’s Supreme Name**
Invoke the Overseer of Destiny. Inscribe in blue-green on a one-foot scroll, fast for seven days, and place it in the courtyard. Within the time it takes to eat a meal, the Overseer of Destiny will appear in form, and one may inquire about fortune or misfortune.

**Summoning the High Heavenly Name**
Invoke the Recorder of Deeds.

**Summoning the Supreme Name**
Invoke the Overseer of the Yin. Wearing this talisman averts weapons.

**Summoning the August Heavenly Name**
Invoke the Overseer of Perils. Inscribe in red on blue-green silk and place it in the house; the Overseer of Perils will arrive immediately, and one may inquire about fortune or misfortune.

**Summoning the Azure Heavenly Name**
Invoke the Mountain Spirits. Inscribe on white silk five inches in length and place it in the room with cinnabar.

**Summoning the High Sovereign’s Name**
Invoke the River Earl. Place it in water, and the River Earl will arrive immediately; one may inquire about water-related matters.

**Summoning the Supreme Lord’s Name**
Invoke the Celestial Chancellor. Inscribe in cinnabar on yellow silk and place it in the room; the Celestial Chancellor will arrive immediately, and one may inquire about the feasibility of one’s endeavors.

**Summoning the Heavenly Emperor’s Name**
Invoke the Nine Heavenly Parents. Inscribe in cinnabar and inquire about one’s descendants or make requests. Wearing this prevents illness and harm.

The above is from the *Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit*.
Here ends the twenty-fifth scroll of the *Supreme Secret Essentials*.

**Scroll Twenty-Eight of the Supreme Secret Essentials: The Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Spirit**

The Celestial Worthy addressed the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings: These Nine Heavens’ Chapters are the *qi* of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, where three gatherings form sound and coalesce into true script. They blend with the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes. Thus, the Great One tests and observes, grasping life across the ten directions, leading to the comprehension of Cavernous Emptiness. They reveal vows in cinnabar and azure, for without eons of karmic affinity and predestined names, even the imperial charts cannot be beheld. Those who attain a glimpse of these texts and their titles shall ascend with nine generations of ancestors.

**First: The Chapter on Generating the Spirit in the Immeasurable Heaven of Yudu**
*The Primordial Qi of the Imperial Perfected Womb-Life, the Primal Unity’s Yellow Evolution*

Blending with the Cavernous Void’s *qi*,
Flying souls drift in the distant and serene.
Eons of boundless renewal stretch endlessly,
Vast and remote, severed from the root.
Suffering souls sink through nine nights,
Yearning for dawn’s yang to lift them.
The Great Possession opens the Gate of Mystery,
Yudu descends in the morning’s aurora.
Yellow clouds congeal in the numinous palace,
Yin and yang’s *qi*-signs intertwine.
The womb’s origin knits long life,
Evil roots dissolve in transformation.
Peach and health merge with essence to extend,
The Two Emperors flourish with jade splendor.
They irrigate the womb’s life-origin,
Refining essence so the spirit never withers.
The Nine Heavens’ Spirit-Generating Chapter—
The spirit, once born, transcends itself.
The Primal Lord bars the path of death,
The Marshal recites the Cavernous Hymns.
One chant summons the myriad perfected in harmony,
Nine recitations bring the heavens to court.
Bowing in reverence through kalpas of ages,
We celebrate this glory of the ancient sprout.

**Second: The Chapter on Generating the Spirit in the Lifespan-Immeasurable Heaven of Upper Upper Meditation Virtue**
*The Qi of the Imperial Perfected Embryo-Life, the Cavernous Dark Purple Gate*

The Purple Gate coalesces in boundlessness,
*Qi* honored as the Heavenly King within.
It ferries flying mystery-souls,
Congealing transformations in the wheel of emptiness.
The old root departs from past attachments,
The karmic origin yearns for its former lineage.
Through dark nights and distant kalpas,
It faces the great cycle’s passage.
The Imperial Perfected’s radiant essence,
Named "Primal Yang," the Infant Scribe of a Hundred Flowers,
Forms the embryo and guards the Yellow Chamber.
Severing roots to seal the gate of death,
Nurturing the infant with joyful countenance.
Meditation virtue guides the numinous *qi*,
Mysterious nourishment feeds the flying heavens’ fragrance.
Flowering luminosity adorns the jade form,
Refinement forges its own visage.
Devoted to the mystery of fostering life,
Arrayed in readiness for the Hall of Light.
The Great Void stirs with numinous convergence,
Commanding me to chant the Spirit-Generating Chapter.
One chant moves the Nine Mysteries,
A second recitation unites heaven and earth.
Blending in natural harmony,
Nine repetitions perfect human achievement.
The Great Sage rejoices in primal felicity,
Scattering blossoms in homage to the Great Void.
All heavens delight in unison,
Every being bows in reverence.

**Third: The Chapter on Generating the Spirit in the Heaven of Xuanyan, Overseen by Brahma**
*The Qi of the Imperial Perfected Soul-Life, the Long-Numinous Bright Immortal*

Xuanyan governs the Three Numinosities,
The Primal *qi* divides from the Mysterious Origin.
Vast and unbounded, the great pattern unfolds,
The Jasper Capital crowned with emerald jade.
The Bright Brahma’s flying mystery-light
Opens the path for long-night souls.
Wandering souls hasten to their destined return,
*Qi* by *qi* reverting to the original root.
The Supreme Emperor is titled "Yang Hall,"
His name: "Eightfold Numinous Lord."
Nine openings reverse the path of Lu,
Embryonic *qi* births the Upper Prime.
Ascending Brahma to review the ledgers of life,
The Great One assists in refining essence.
The Mud-Pill Palace numbers the imperial seats,
The Three Sections and Eight Luminaries divide.
The soul’s birth seizes the wandering *qi*,
Nine revolutions perfect immortality.
Resonant, the Nine Heavens’ sound,
Jade scriptures generate the myriad spirits.
Three recitations array them in proper ranks,
*Qi* intermingles at the Eight Mornings’ Gates.
The Mysterious Pass bars the gate of death,
The numinous guards the source of fluids.
Responding to the convergence of numinous fate,
The Way illumines the hidden turning wheel.
Celebrating this infant’s transformation,
We bow in praise of the Cavernous Scriptures.

**Fourth: The Chapter on Generating the Spirit in the Heaven of Silence and Dou-Shu**
*The Qi of the Imperial Perfected Corpse-Life, the Vast Corpse’s Dark Evolution*

Silent, the colorless origin,
Dou-Shu resists the Great Net.
Numinous transformations divide the Four Luminaries,
Myriad strands of emerald and vermilion auroras.
The wandering *po* does not glance back,
Once departed, it pierces the demonic throng.
The Divine Duke seizes the wandering *qi*,
Floating, refining the pristine blossoms.
Flourishing through kalpas of camphor,
Riding the cycle in accord with the numinous chart.
The Cavernous Void’s Spirit-Generating Chapter—
Jade tones soar beyond the Nine Auroras.
One chant gathers the myriad perfected,
The soaring souls unite as a family.
Nine revolutions complete the luminous array,
Lush and radiant, the jade blossoms gleam.

The numinous chariot requires no bridle,
Luminously, the Spirit-Generating Chapter arises.
The Cavernous Void is truly boundless,
The mysterious souls, too, grow strong.
Refining the embryo to return to the origin,
Eternally riding the Flying Mystery’s beam.
Abandoning the celestial true in vain,
Scattered thoughts await the constant path.
Severing the stagnant womb-tree,
The heart wanders beyond the Upper Capital.
Wishes and meetings are profoundly profound,
Awakening, I forget both principle and self.
Blessings from the Nine Heavens’ summit,

Floating to ascend the high numinous abode.
The circular wheel ceaselessly reflects,
True immortals stand in ordered ranks.

The Lofty Path of the Highest Empyrean stretches afar,

Towering, the many hills and mounds.
The darkened mind roams freely,
Loftily awaiting the pure spirit’s journey.
A blessed encounter transcends years,
How can kalpas be named?
The floating soul follows its former branch,
Returning to the womb by its own constancy.
Numinous resonance pervades the Great Void,
Soaring steps tread the empyrean’s ice.
Ford-crossings stir myriad currents,
Silently congealing, the true spirit ascends.
No desire thus no sorrow,
Lofty contemplation bows and rises.

**Right Section from *The Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Generative Spirit Chapters*:
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Texts**

The *Tai Xiao Lang Shu* is the melody of the Nine Heavenly Kings’ soaring empyrean, the *Qiong Wen Di Zhang* is the text of the Nine Heavens’ summit. Both arose when the Primordial Beginning was born within the spontaneous, hollow vastness. The Jade Emperor of the Hollow Sovereign received them, whereupon the Heavenly Kings inscribed their names therein.

**First: The Jade Text of the Heavenly King of Yu Dan, the Immeasurable Heaven**
The *qi* of the Great Empyrean’s hollow vastness,
Congeals into cloud encampments.
Our King excels in divine craft,
Transforming as if without form.
Within formlessness lies the true,
From the true, the formless is born.
In the distant, boundless void above,
Soughing, the Primordial Beginning’s essence.
Dharma-light illumines wondrous awakening,
Mysterious movement comes to summon.
Constellations array the jade cosmos,
Flying mists transcend green jasper.
Resplendent, the Three Dawns’ radiance,
Streaming light thickens into purple clarity.
Grasping robes at the Jade Radiance Terrace,
Unfastening rest to sport in Phoenix City.
Turning through the empyrean, ascending the Nine Peaks,
To inaugurate an inexhaustible age.
Who can journey here with me?
Come seek my name.
My name is easily known—
It abides in the Eastern Flowery Court.
From there, one may dawn upon the Mysterious Capital,
Contemplating the Emperor’s numinous subtlety.
Cast aside thoughts beyond the clouds,
Focus singularly on the Yellow Tranquility.
Reciting the *Tai Xiao* chapters,
The Three Passes will naturally clarify.
Mysterious descents in lingering chariots,
The void dispatches flying mists.
Though the Nine Heavens seem distant,
Wondrous thought settles your form.

**Second: The Jade Text of the Heavenly King of Shang Shang Shan Shan, the Immeasurable Heaven of Goodness and Non-Toxicity**
Numinous movement initiates the hollow vast,
Golden perfection nurtures the jasper embryo.
Dharma-light illumines the Great Stillness Court,
Mysterious transformation propels itself.
Through kalpas, sinking into the Nine Darks,
With the true, it contracts a hidden tryst.
The Three Dawns announce to the Primordial Beginning,
Movement flows freely, naturally pacified.
Guiding reins above the bright mists,
Streaming essence gleams on jade branches.
Glancing back, within the origin there is,
Merging like an infant.
Father’s tranquility and mother’s essence,
Carefree, sporting at Phoenix Terrace.
Falling light roams the cloud chambers,
Peerless wonder—who can know?
Joining felicity, departing the Net Gate,
Unfastening robes at the Purple Empyrean’s cliffs.
If you wish to seek me,
Diligently study the *Lang Shu* verses.
Revolving the jade texts,
The Heavenly King will naturally respond.
Abide in the Emperor’s singular honor,
As the foundation for seeking immortality.
Sever thoughts, cast aside external musings,
Ever keeping the heart-spirit serene.
Accumulating resonance summons the true to descend,
Lushly, the feathered regalia shines.
Delivering the roots of the seven ancestors,
All ascend the cloud steps together.
Jade verses reflect the lofty numinous,
Jasper texts defy contemplation.
Two wonders harmonize,
Each proclaiming their original disparity.
If you wish to sport in the Nine Mysteries,
Simply recite the *Tai Xiao* poems.
Ten thousand kalpas pass in an instant,
Do not fret over heaven’s delay.

**Third: The Jade Text of the Heavenly King of the Brahma-Monitoring Heaven**
Limpid clarity, without the slightest defilement,
Congealed *qi* forms purple radiance.
The Cinnabar Empyrean reflects the Monitoring Heaven,
Arrayed in the southwest’s return.
The Three Dawns illumine the constellations,
Seven revolutions brighten the Supreme Subtlety.
Numinous winds swiftly carry rare fragrance,
Jade pipes—how mournful their sound!
Divine phoenixes soar in jasper groves,
Hosts of immortals shake their feathered robes.
The Heavenly King rides the movement’s summons,
Grasping the tally, he governs the myriad mechanisms.
Void chariots hurl through the hollow vast,
Vast and bright, the Nine Heavens’ gates.
Escorting guests from the empyrean’s midst,
Unfastening robes to enter the jasper curtains.
Spreading brilliance to support the dawn’s *qi*,
Radiant nets gleam on jade steps.
Ascending Brahma, reflecting the vermilion sun,
A thousand lights wing the numinous glow.
Within the whirlwind of primal transformation,
The jade chariot lingers in circuit.
The Noble Son commands the tiger tally,
Gathering all spirits to return.
Eradicating the roots of the seven ancestors,
Exhausted souls all become immortal and fly.
The *Lang Shu* in the Felicitous Cloud Court,
Jasper texts in the hollow’s subtlety.
Diligently studying, the Dao’s sun shines fresh,
Through a hundred kalpas, the numinous never decays.
Myriad transformations follow movement’s shifts,
Thus knowing the wondrous are rare.

**Fourth: The Jade Text of the Heavenly King of the Silent Heaven**
Feasting on light in the Great Stillness Land,
Whirling winds swiftly turn the jasper wheel.
The Cinnabar Empyrean wings the green chariot,
Divine lords assist the Emperor’s honor.
Hazy, beyond the Nine Transformations,
Separate, departing the gate of inclinations.
Lingering upon golden nets,
Whistling and singing, celebrating the numinous clouds.
Three chants illumine the mysterious awakening,
Five revolutions divide the Dao.
Golden chambers resplendent and towering,
Streaming essence—how profuse!
Glancing left, beholding the Peerless,
Chanting right, gazing upon the White Origin.
Treading prosperity, crossing the Yellow Register,
The Great One excels in the root of destiny.
For me, record the immortal register,
Bestow upon me the text for transcending destiny.
Pure chanting moves the heavenly true,
Stillness governs the hundred passes.

**The Emperor-Unity Mirrors the Numinous Palace,**
Ritual robes soar in azure flocks.
Where do they meet in covenant?
Converging at the apex of the Nine Heavens.
Though the sun shines, no fixed hour is set—
The imperial splendor holds fast to the Four Constants.
Supreme mindfulness casts aside all other thoughts,
The Dao is transmitted from within the Mysterious.

Numinous resonance follows its own course,
Yet those who attain the highest learning are ever whole.

**Joy Without Arrogance: Jade Writ of the Heavenly King, Fifth Chapter**
Within the void, purple mists arise,
Thick and billowing, veiling the Flowery Palace.
Luminous radiance follows the revolving fate,
The Cinnabar Empyrean illumines the verdant chambers.
Wings and aids manifest in the midst of emptiness,
Numinous brilliance shines across the ten directions.
The myriad emperors move by true destiny,
Yet none surpass the King of the Nine Heavens.

His form coalesces with natural elegance,
Holding qi, he emerges from the Void Palace.
Governing transformation at the Four Cardinal Points,
He is hailed as the ancestor of all emperors.
Descending in splendor, riding the Eight Mists,
He unites all wheels in the harmony of space.
At dawn he roams the Western Terrace,
At dusk he rests in the Fusang Palace.

He grasps the jade tablet of the Mysterious Realm’s register,
Liberating the verdant youths of Hua.
Peach and prosperity fix the ledger of destiny,
Bright beginnings preserve the merit of the kalpa.
His sweeping gaze knows no bounds,
The myriad transformations follow the turning fate.
With flying steps, he chants the *Great Empyrean*,
In seclusion, he seeks the traces of the Primordial Beginning.

Accumulated thought stirs the utmost stillness,
Thus ascending to the Mysterious Wisdom.
The legacy of past foundations flows as blessings,
Seven ancestors return to the Southern Palace.
The Five Sufferings are not his path—
His bonds of friendship lie in the Great Void.
The numinous peaks are no ordinary abode,
Flying clouds are his dragons.

Joining hands with the Perfected of the Nine Summits,
He pairs with the radiant to form a pair.
Why remain mired in the clamor of filth,
Dallying until destiny’s end?

**Responding to Transformation by Voice: Jade Writ of the Heavenly King, Sixth Chapter**
Lofty numen shines through the empty cavern,
Congealed qi forms crimson mists.
Waving his staff, he circles the Nine Empyreans,
Drifting, the Heavenly Emperor Perfected.
Jasper terraces gleam upon the rocky cliffs,
Purple phoenixes and jade unicorns flourish.
Ethereal songs drift through the secluded palace,
The solitary one above the clouds.

Holding covenant in the Sevenfold Radiant Chambers,
Golden nets gleam in the central fields.
The Heavenly King embodies the Nine Colors,
Flying immortals number in the billions.
The Cavernous Yang glows with numinous signs,
Marking the years of destiny’s crossing.
Cinnabar blossoms brighten the vermilion sun,
Flowing fragrance bathes the destined body.

Gazing upward, he sips the nectar of the moon,
The Nine Springs pour forth their liquid essence.
Ever preserving through endless kalpas,
Within and without, the Cavernous Void shines resplendent.
Accumulated thought moves the Great Void,
Penetrating the abyss of the Boundless.
Form merges with the primordial unity,
Roaming and feasting—none can turn him back.

**Brahma-Treasure: Jade Writ of the Heavenly King, Seventh Chapter**
Three dawns illumine the secluded night,
Streaming rosy clouds gleam like golden suns.
The cinnabar chambers blaze in towering splendor,
Numinous incense coils around the jasper halls.
The noble scions gather in the Hall of Celebration,
Treading prosperity, grasping the Emperor-Unity.
The Three Origins merge in the Harmonious Palace,
Their subtle words most profound and secret.

Should the destined wish to cross the years of fate,
Let stillness in thought admit no杂 distractions.
Though stillness may seem as if nothing exists,
The true emerges from the void’s midst.
Blessings extend without fail,
The Seven Mysteries are naturally liberated.
Accumulated merit has deep foundations,
Past roots are all dissolved and extinguished.

The jade writ contains wondrous verses—
Guard this chapter, never forget or lose it.
Hold in mind the most numinous taboos,
The Dao descends, uniting with the Mysterious Unity.

**Brahma-Māyā: Jade Writ of the Heavenly King, Eighth Chapter**
The Nine Mysteries permeate the primordial qi,
Purple and white ascend the Jade Empyrean.
Numinous elegance gleams at the Golden Gate,
Spiritual fusion flourishes in the jasper branches.
Vast and open, the Purple Void Pavilion,
Celebratory clouds follow the transformations and vanish.
The abyssal echo strikes the numinous mechanism,
The dharma drum resounds in the Great Seclusion.

Feasting in the Mysterious Dawn’s gate,
Revolving currents skim the cloudy gales.
Beyond the Nine Heavens, he guides the reins,
Driving his chariot in carefree roaming.
Lingering upon the Purple Radiance Peak,
His bearing chilled at the Jade Emperor’s court.
The turning kalpa lasts not a moment,
In an instant, the two symbols converge.

The empty courtyard knows no delay,
Coming and going, following fate’s vastness.
Great transformation does not alter its measure,
The Three Dawns illumine the numinous signs.
Jade script celebrates the divine chamber,
Jasper writ orders the pure songs.
Holding elegance, he emerges from the Mysterious,
Returning countenance—no mere floral adornment.

**Pārijāta-Forgiveness: Jade Writ of the Heavenly King, Ninth Chapter**
Primordial qi congeals in the Nine Empyreans,
The Purple Void brightens the Great Yang.
Flying jasper ascends the blossoming splendor,
Flowing essence crystallizes as jade frost.
Heavenly Perfected ride the revolving fate,
Thin clouds flourish upon the Mysterious Beam.
Dark convergence arises from mutual resonance,
The Cinnabar Empyrean reflects their light passage.

The secluded tryst lies in the High Dawn’s mansion,
Holding covenant, they ascend the Jade Capital.
Numinous transformation surges within the vast,
The boundless, dark realm of fate’s turning.
Flowing fragrance veils the vermilion sun,
Whirling winds swiftly carry rare incense.
Resplendent above the Golden Gate,
Jasper terraces sprout jade blossoms.

Orchids and mushrooms fill the Mysterious Valley,
Gazing upward, he swallows the flourishing Six Stomachs.
Spirit soars, stirring the Secluded Palace,
Profound thought pierces the Cavernous Realm.
Grasping the covenant in the Great Empyrean’s hall,
He studies the jasper writ of the Emperor Perfected.

The *Great Empyrean Jade Script* and *Jasper Writ of the Emperor Perfected*—
Both employ the Nine Mysteries’ subtle words to address the Nine Heavenly Kings within the Cavernous Void,
Before the Primordial Beginning.
Mysterious songs govern destiny,
Roaming and celebrating in the Empyrean Court.
Their sounds and phrases, empty and subtle,
Arise from the Mysterious to generate the divine and true treasured formulas.
Thus are the numinous chapters composed.

Those who practice this Dao
Attain rank equal to the Nine Heavens.
Subtle thought reaches the utmost taboos,
Holding spirit and mind in the true.
Numinous grace descends in response,
Naturally ascending at dawn.

*From the* Wondrous Writ of the Jade Script of the Great Empyrean’s Emperor Perfected
*Right section of* The Supreme Secret Essentials, Scroll Twenty-Eight
*The Supreme Secret Essentials, Scroll Twenty-Nine*

**The Thirty-Two Heavens’ Hymns of Praise**

The Most High Dao Lord observed a pure fast and upheld the precepts in the Western Jade Realm of Xina, upon the Floating Mountain of Yuqie’s summit. He spread golden mats upon the earth, laid white jade and green jasper steps, and adorned the space with seven-jeweled garlands. Radiance blazed like the sun, yellow clouds coiled on all sides, and purple auroras wound thrice around.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, together with all the Heavenly Worthies and Great Sages, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Boundless Spirit Kings, the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Earthbound Immortals, and the Five Thearch Perfected, descended from the void to take their seats. Streaming light illumined all, and the two luminaries merged in darkness.

The Most High Dao Lord, overcome with joy, advanced to bow and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Today, the host of sages has descended upon this empty mountain, and the assembly of Perfected rejoices beyond measure. I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to command the Supreme Perfected of the Western Palace to unfurl the strings of the Cavernous Void and harmonize the numinous chapters of spontaneity, that those who have not seen may see, and those who have not heard may hear.”

The Heavenly Worthy, filled with delight, replied: “The numinous chapters of the Cavernous Void and the jade tones of the Heavens are treasured in the Upper Palace and have never been transmitted below. Yet today, at this auspicious feast, joy defies expression, and such an extraordinary gathering brooks no concealment. Now I shall proclaim them universally to the Thirty-Two Heavens, that the fasted Perfected may join in harmony and chant the numinous chapters.”

Thereupon, the Dao Lord bowed his head in reverent celebration, and the hosts of the Heavens, filled with joy, each offered their hymns:

**Hymn of the Grand Yellow Sovereign Heaven**
Virtue crowns the Great Veil,
Pure winds uphold the Mysterious Record.
The heavens’ form endures eternally,
Gazing upon the world, the principle turns manifest.
Treading the path through unending kalpas,
Exploring the hidden, transcending life and death.
The Three Vehicles open the way,
Pure and void, free of dust and dross.
The long night stills the wandering souls,
Hell’s five torments dissolve.
Sword trees no longer sway their branches,
Blade mountains no longer wound the body.
Gates are guarded by lords of vast kalpas,
The earth knows no children of untimely death.
Today, at this joyous gathering,
All the Heavens unite in celebration.
Overcome with gladness,
They raise their voices in reverent hymns.

**Hymn of the Grand Brightness Jade Perfection Heaven**
Feasting in the Jade Perfection’s heights,
Wandering chariots roam the Mysterious Capital.
Carefree within the Grand Brightness,
Eternal lamps gleam upon emerald gauze.
Numinous winds brush layered clouds,
Dragon mounds rise in towering splendor.
Above, Flying Heavenly Beings,
Feathered robes flutter in blossoming hues.
Below, the people of the Dragon Han,
All dwell in kalpas vast as oceans.
The five paths still the wandering souls,
The nine darknesses end the three roads.
Heavenly steeds draw from the Eastern Well,
Endless springs know no silt.
No more the cries of lonely souls,
Only songs of joy resound.
This bliss knows no end—
What shall we do when the turning kalpas come?

**Hymn of the Luminous Childlike Heaven**
The Childlike Heaven of No-Form,
Its Mysterious Origin governs the Grand Clarity.
Resplendent as jade metropolis,
Yellow clouds coil around its four chariots.
Purple groves embellish the southern mounds,
Whirling winds stir crimson jades.
Phoenixes cry, and the long night unfolds,
The nine darknesses brighten in tenfold turns.
The Crow Mother halts the Heavenly River,
Dragons bear the cold well’s emptiness.
The five paths sever the roots of opposition,
The three roads no longer bind with soldiers.
Banners turn to subdue the heavenly demons,
Yellow standards array the northern camps.
The Cavernous Chapters ferry dark souls,
The three realms know no wailing cries.
Above lies the Palace of Blessed Virtue,
Below, forms of renewed life.
This is the law of the Primordial Beginning,
Wondrous indeed, the *Cavernous Void Scripture*.
In joy and reverence, we chant and bow,
Raising our voices to celebrate ten thousand ages.

**Hymn of the Mysterious Womb Nurturing Heaven**
The Nurturing Heaven stands against the three tiers,
Its spirit turns to traverse the ten directions.
Above, it opens the gates of the long night,
Below, it illumines the chambers of the nine darknesses.
Suffering souls ride the celebration home,
Flying to enter the halls of blessing.
Mountains know no souls of grievance,
Only lords of vast kalpas remain.
The Primordial Beginning turns his jade chariot,
Yellow banners summon the numinous winds.
Sweeping clean the five paths’ grounds,
Karmic opposition rides the turning kalpas to passage.
Flying immortals unite in joy,
Celebrating our Palace of Longevity.

**Hymn of the Primordial Brightness Literary Elevation Heaven**
The net of the void dances in round perfection,
Purple wheels adorn the jade court.
Literary Elevation unfurls its crimson radiance,
The Three Conveniences govern the Jade Clarity.
The Net of Separation shines like the Long-Lived Star,
The nine nights gleam with lofty brightness.
The three realms know no dead souls,
Countless kalpas all become spirits.
Majestic, the Ten Sage Lords,
Their virtuous conduct soars in the *Flying Heavenly Scripture*.
One recitation invokes the Heavens’ rites,
Ten turns revive withered bones.
The Seven Mysteries ascend the Vermilion Palace,
Enjoying blessings to enter formlessness.

**Hymn of the Upper Brightness Seven Luminaries Heaven**
Riding the luminous scene, they roam the Three Simplicities,
Soaring high to the palaces of sun and moon.
The Seven Luminaries blaze in the Upper Clarity,
Yu Yi dries in the chambers of jade.
Dispelling demons, not as friends of the Cavernous,
They bind the radiant ones as their companions.
Traversing the ten heavens’ people,
Together they sip the Flying Flower Sovereign’s nectar.
At dawn, they align with the five clouds’ *qi*,
At dusk, they chant the three dawns’ light.
The demonic barbarians know no world,
The five paths’ grounds are nowhere to be found.
Countless kalpas unite as royal citizens,
All called the Hall of Blessed Virtue.

**Hymn of the Void Transcending Balance Heaven**
The Void embraces the Great Veil,
Flying nets dance at the Heavenly Gates.
Pushing through the totality of the Primordial Record,
The four *qi* divide day and night.
Nine assemblies mark extraordinary kalpas,
Named the Gate of Transcending Balance.
Heaven and earth’s principles settle themselves,
Yet joy and bliss cannot endure forever.
This is the realm of blessed virtue,
Where life arises free of evil roots.
Why must the turning kalpas hasten,
Their revolutions never aligning in time?
Grieving for those yet to come,
We chant these mournful and joyous verses.

**Hymn of the Supreme Ultimate Veiled Heaven**
The Veiled Heaven gleams in layered emptiness,
Radiant spirits reflect upon vermilion doors.
The thirty-two heavenly youths,
Broidered robes of flying azure.
Bearing banners, grasping the registers of fate,
They summon and gather the suffering souls.
The long night opens its five gates,
The nine darknesses shine brightly.
The Supreme Ultimate’s Palace of Longevity—
Names inscribed, all ascend as immortals.
The Dharma Gate ferries the heavenly people,
Countless kalpas follow of their own accord.
Seven generations sever the roots of suffering,
Singing as they ascend to the Purple Tenuity.

**Hymn of the Vermilion Brightness Harmonious Yang Heaven**
Vermilion Brightness unfurls the Primordial Chart,
Harmonious Yang returns to the Upper Void.
The Primordial Beginning spreads the numinous chapters,
Ten divisions of the *Flying Heavenly Scripture*.
Opening the deliverance of the nine darknesses’ ancestors,
Ten thousand recitations, the Dao dwells within.
Five mounds adorn the jade palaces,
Life and death become the abode of blessed virtue.
Without the Yellow Register’s writ,
How could the roots of suffering be removed?
Long fasts and recitations of the numinous chapters,
The Five Numinous Ones support one another.
Merit complete, the foundations of heaven and earth,
Generation after generation overflow with celebration.

**Hymn of the Mysterious Brightness Reverent Florescence Heaven**
The *Reverent Florescence Scripture of the Ten Directions*,
Resolving the tones of all the Heavens.

Spreading practice across the Five Paths,
Delivering those of noble aspiration.
The Yellow Demon subdues the Great Demon,
The Red Writs extinguish the lofty groves.
The Three Realms open the mysterious road,
The Heavenly Heart pities the wailing souls.
Passing beyond the Eight Diff

Amid the blade-mountains, keen edges fall,
The Nine Darks unfold their nightly glow.
Tormented souls cast off layered gloom,
Swift as the gale they ascend the Hall of Blessing.
Turning through my Three Vehicles’ gate,
Lifetimes arise as lords of immortals.

*Ode to the Boundless River-Source Heaven*
Boundless, formless realm—
Vast and dim, the Primal Beginning’s dawn.
The River-Source mirrors the Highest Mystery,
Radiant, the Five Scriptures unfurl.
Ten Heavens’ halls of green silk,
Oblivion’s sheen and the sun’s purity.
Five Elders feast in the Round Palace,
Wondrous lads align with the Numinous Mound.
Gazing upward, they chant the Well of Eternity,
Refining the embryo, returning to infancy.
The *Taiyi Preserving-Life Record*,
From Southern Mound, delivers the night-dwellers.
In the Nine Darks, no soul perishes;
At the gate, bodies are reborn.
Past bonds to the Five Sufferings severed,
Kalpa upon kalpa, they dwell in immortals’ abodes.

All heavens in unison rejoice,
In desolate quiet, the sacred texts are intoned.

*Ode to Ruanle Soaring Heaven*
Ruanle soars on dark effulgence,
Cinnabar clouds spread o’er the Three Nets.
Revolving banners summon the ten thousand spirits,
Gongs and drums call forth the celestial demons.
Gongs and drums call forth the celestial demons,
Sweeping clear the Nine Darks’ paths,
Dragons and crows bear the Long River aloft.
Ethereal, they rise above the formless realm,
The soaring tree blossoms with jade radiance.
All sages gather in the Jasper Palace,
The Queen Mother commands the pure song.
Shuangcheng’s yang-melody,
A single chant summons celestial harmony.
Ten chants dissolve the Five Sufferings,
Night-souls cast off layered silks,
Seven spirits return to the numinous embryo,
Rotten bones bloom anew.
The Hall of Blessing teems with pure guests,
In hell, no adversary remains.
The workings of qi proceed naturally,
Thus the Three Paths come to rest.
One flourish stirs ten thousand kalpas’ gratitude,
Jubilation fills the Western Jade That.

*Ode to the Vow-Sworn Heaven of No Limit*
Vow-Sworn, lofty and limpid,
Void and vast, tenfold revolving.
Azure essence first encircles,
Primal qi unfolds its splendor.
Great Possession illumines all,
The Red Emperor lingers in circuit.
Five Talismans flow resplendent,
The Primal Lord releases his might.
Ten thousand spirits bow in awe,
Hordes of demons crumble and fade.
Heaven clears, earth is purged,
The Nine Darks stand wide and open.
After eons of reckoning,
Each follows the mandate to return.
Roots are severed, wombs cut off,
The dead corpses shine with life.
Seven ancestors receive the numinous,
All attain immortal flight.
Extinguished and transcended without limit,
Blessings and joy tower in the luminous court.

*Ode to the Radiant Court Ascending Heaven*
The Radiant Court illumines the Ten,
Pale radiance floats westward.
The Vermilion Youth brandishes his staff,
Urging the spirits of the Nine Mounds.
With flying steps he seizes demons,
Commands spirits, summons the formless.
Gathering qi, he steers the course,
The Primal Beginning roams in brightness.
In a flash, the Four Eights,
Great images intermingle and revolve.
Through kalpas, life’s gates open,
The Five Thearchs display their talismans.
Ten turns return the mysterious,
Dharma grace flows abundantly.
Earth’s treasuries release their stores,
Gold and jade fill every corner.
Dead souls hasten to return,
White bones grow flesh anew.
Carefree on the lofty terrace,
They soar as celestial companions.

*Ode to the Profound Cavern Heaven*
The Profound Cavern gleams in brightness,
Tai bai’s supreme essence.
The Golden Immortal, the Yellow Mother,
Named the Luminous Numinous.
To her right, the Moon Maiden,
To her left, the Life-Sustaining One.
Seven Primes emit their light,
The Sun Lad tosses his bells.
Might shakes the profound depths,
Resplendent, meteors rush forth.
All converge from the ten thousand directions,
Receiving deliverance in the immortals’ court.
Qi does not encircle the dead,
Brahmā-conduct engenders life.
Golden towers amass their records,
Above, the kalpas’ names are inscribed.
When merits are complete, they ascend,
In the Moon Palace, their forms are refined.
To attain the feathered robes,
One must master the Vermilion Infant.
When the Vermilion Infant is mastered,
The records enter the Flowering Azure.
The Five Thearchs escort them apart,
Descending in flying chariots.
Seven ancestors rejoice together,
All ascend to the Highest Clarity.

*Ode to the Wondrous Perfected Heaven*
The Wondrous Perfected’s Upper Capital,
Mysterious model transforms and pervades.
Revolving in Brahmā-conduct,
Filling the Ten Directions.
Formless, they ride the course,
Observing the world’s great impartiality.
To the left, the sun; to the right, the moon,
Virtue bears its majestic radiance.
In one illumination, heaven and earth,
Life and death flourish universally.
All sufferings and hardships are lifted,
Forever parted from Northern Feng.
Crowned and girded in the Southern Realm,
The groves of decaying forms.
Rotten bones rise and walk,
Soaring to the Great Void.
Carefree in the mysterious emptiness,
Clothed and fed in the Hall of Blessing.
With the Primal Beginning, they share affinity,
Lifetimes arise as lords of immortals.

*Ode to the Prohibited Upper Heaven*
The Prohibited Upper Heaven’s kalpa turns,
Revolving spirits on high.
Traversing all heavens,
The thirty-two barriers.
Wheeling dances in the empty cavern,
In a flash, ascending the high pavilion.
All sages come to celebrate,
Together they pay homage at the Jade Gate.
Flying, they tread the void,
In desolate quiet, the sacred texts are intoned.
Jubilant radiance streams through the night,
Returning fragrance, auspicious dust.
Moon-water gleams with blossoms,
Sun-essence refines the immortals.
Flying effulgences pour forth in all directions,
Gold and jade entwine and spiral.
The great kalpa’s dark convergence,
Ten thousand kalpas’ obscure shift.
Life and death share joy,
Radiant and blissful, full of delight.
Flying celestials lead by the hand,
Feasting and reveling in the purple dawn.
Grasping the course, they preserve their years,
Forever enjoying the natural.

*Ode to the Supreme Constantly Harmonious Heaven*
Constantly Harmonious pours forth numinous qi,
All heavens receive its truth.
Gathering the essence of sun and moon,
They stride in splendor, treading luminous jade.
Above, they sip the Supreme Dao,
Eternally renewing their twilight years.
Not delighting in soaring through heaven,
They seek deliverance through the Northern Mystery.
Vast, the Dragon Han’s beginning,
No evil adversaries remain.
Only the immortals’ toil is feared,
Joyfully wandering the round and square.
Ethereal, they ride the course to return,
Yet feel no toil or hardship.
Through ancient kalpas, they tread to gather,
Now they join the celestial guests.
In the Western That’s assembly,
They revel in good karmic bonds.
Delivering seven ancestors in flight,
Ten thousand beginnings gather in the Hall of Blessing.
Crowned and girded, the flying celestial throng,
Soaring on the vast waves’ crests.
Waving my banner of life-deliverance,
In an instant, the Two Modes part,
In a flash, they pay homage to the Imperial Honored One.

*Ode to the Supreme Ultimate’s Resplendent Heaven*
Vast and dim, the Great Net Heaven,
The Supreme Ultimate’s Jade Clarity precincts.
Resplendent, the primal qi of chaos,
Eightfold pervading, leveling the subtle and obscure.
Brahmā-conduct bears no form or hue,
Lofty and firm, no peril of collapse.
When the great kalpas’ reckoning is complete,
Alone it remains, limpid and bright.
Heaven and earth dissolve and vanish,
All sages hasten to return.
Circling the seven-jeweled terrace,
Treading the void, they shake their feathered robes.
Roaming the jade gardens,
How lush the gemstone groves!
Radiant and blissful, unaware of dawn,
In a flash, the great kalpa revolves.
What joy surpasses this joy?
The numinous treasure gleams with true majesty.
Five scriptures plant the mysterious root,
The heavens’ gates open wide.
Born beyond the Great Net’s bounds,
Great and small alike soar as immortals.

Today the host of perfected gather,
Yet the Primordial Beginning’s presence is seldom seen.
Clapping hands in harmony with the Hollow Cavern,
Their zither-songs—how mournful they ring!
Lofty their chants, proclaiming ten thousand kalpas,
As the Most High beckons with his eternal banner.

Here ends the twenty-ninth scroll of *The Supreme Secret Essentials*,
Excerpted from *The Scripture of Cavernous Mystery and the Hollow Cavern’s Numinous Hymns*.

Yulong how towering and vast,
Its soaring heights the foundation of ten thousand Ways.
Triple qi births layered mists,
The Purple Tenuity shines with lush radiance.
Colorless, it ascends into empty space,
So distant and subtle it defies thought.
Within dwells the deathless spirit,
Surnamed Peach, named Returning Child.
None but the people of the Dark Capital
Can know what lies within its form.
For humans, it is the true mandate’s register,
The tally that extends the era of well-being.
Its course unfolds in the age of Eternal Joy,
All sharing the same moment in time.
Yet since the Kaihuang departed,
Where have the ten thousand kalpas each gone?
Though this is no realm of final end,
The world below will soon be hard to govern.
The hosts of heaven, wishing to relieve suffering,
Diligently pay homage at the Seven Treasures Terrace.

*Hymn of the Dragon’s Transformation and Brahmā’s Crossing of Heaven*
The dragon transforms high above the layered skies,
Brahmā traverses the threshold of kalpas.
The Three Nets span the flying heavens,
Opening in full the Ten Immortals’ Gates.
Subtle, the qi of human concentration—
Only the Lord of Unity remains.
He turns the pivot of all heavens’ destinies,
Ever revolving the barrier of a hundred million kalpas.
At the grand assembly, the Primordial Beginning confers,
The Jade Terrace examines the souls of the departed.
The exalted ones wander the Seven Treasures,
The flying immortals chant the numinous scripture.
One intones, the host of immortals responds,
With every word, the boundary of life and death shifts.
They pluck out those bound in endless darkness.

*Supreme Secret Essentials, Scroll Thirty*
*Passage from the Scripture’s Sections*

The King of the Nine Heavens,
Primal source of the ten thousand qi,
Ancestor of all emperors and lords,
Essence and origin of the ninefold qi.
When Heaven and Earth had yet to coalesce,
And the Three Dawns remained unlit,
He spontaneously formed within the Void’s embrace,
Amidst the boundless expanse of primordial chaos.
Through ninety thousand kalpas, the qi divided to govern,
Establishing the Nine Heavens,
Where sun, moon, and stars at last shone forth.
The ten thousand qi flowed and unfolded,
Congealing into the perfected truth of the Dao.
The Primordial August Sovereign and the Supreme Jade Void
Both emerged within the First Heaven.
Thirty-nine Emperors and twenty-four Perfected Ones
Then established palaces and ranks of office.
The August Sovereign’s sacred scriptures were woven from natural patterns,
To practice the Dao of long life and the methods of immortality.
Talismans, jade instructions, and secret formulas
All originated with the King of the Nine Heavens,
Transmitted through generations of the Perfected.
When the Three and Five transformed the cosmic destiny,
And the Nine Numinous Ones answered the appointed time,
The Later Sage, the Ninefold Mystery Dao Lord,
Examined the original source.
After ninety trillion and ninety thousand kalpas,
The August Sovereign’s canonical standards no longer aligned.
In the first year of the Middle August Era, on the first *zhi* day of the ninth month,
Within the Jade Heaven’s Jasper Chamber and Golden Tower,
The Upper Palace commanded the Eastern Flowery Azure Palace
To seek out the standards of past and present,
Collate and revise the ancient texts,
And compile them into three hundred scrolls of sacred scriptures,
Which were then bestowed upon the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad.

*The Exalted Jade Book of Lang* is the melody of the Nine Heavens’ King’s soaring clouds,
*The Jade Texts of Imperial Chapters* are the writings of the Nine Heavens’ summit.
Both arose when the Primordial Beginning first emerged
Within the natural void’s emptiness,
And the Jade Emperor of the Void Sovereign received them from the Nine Mysteries.
*The Eight Scrolls of Yellow Writ from the Grand Tenuity*
Were united with the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens,
Their texts woven in the womb of space,
Passing through countless kalpas
To form natural chapters in the Middle August Era.

The above is from *The Wondrous Scripture of the Cavern-Real Exalted Jade Book of Lang*
And *The Cavern-Real Scripture of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Eight Effulgences*.

*The Golden Writs of the Eight Dao*.

The above is from *The Cavern-Real Scripture of the Eight Dao Secret Words of the Central Yellow Elder Lord*.

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Secret Divine Registers*:
*The Lower Scripture of the Lesser Existence* records:
When the Three Sovereigns governed the world,
Each received one scroll to rule all under Heaven.
In times of urgency, they summoned the gods of Heaven
And the ghosts of Earth, commanding them all.
These were called the *Three Tombs*.
Later, eight emperors succeeded the Three Sovereigns in governance,
Each also receiving one scroll,
Ruling the world through the teachings of spirits and numina.
The first three scrolls were called the *Three Essences*,
The next three the *Three Transformations*,
The following two the *Two Transmutations*.
In all, eight scrolls, called the *Eight Simplicities*.

The above is from *The Scripture of the Cavern-Secret Divine Registers*.

On the first *jia* day of the ninth month of the western *xun*,
The Heavenly Gods of the Brahmā Treasure Realm manifested wondrous signs,
Revealing the imperial scriptures and numinous diagrams,
Congealing into true writs.

On *The Scripture of the Divine Metamorphoses of the Purple Luminance and Blazing Radiance*:
It is not that the Purple Luminance and Blazing Radiance possessed an original text,
But rather that the divine scripture spontaneously arose within the empty void,
Condensing qi into chapters, its mysterious radiance blazing forth.
After seven thousand years, its text became visible.
The Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity inscribed its chapters on purple slips,
And its text in standard script on golden slips,
Recording it as *The Scripture of the Divine Metamorphoses of the Purple Luminance and Blazing Radiance*,
Named for its transformations within the mysterious.

The Nine Heavens’ Venerable One told the Three Heavens’ Jade Lad:
*The Central Record of the Womb Essence of the Nine Elixirs’ Upper Transformation*
Arose at the dawn of the Nine Mysteries,
Formed from the natural qi of the Great Void,
A treasure text practiced by the twenty-four Perfected Ones and thirty-nine Emperors.

*The Hidden Arts of the Eight Earthly Transformations* is the Dao of the Purple Clarity Emperor’s wanderings and concealments, the secrets of departure and change. Its original text comprised eight scrolls, corresponding to the eight directions, containing methods for concealing form and hiding one’s radiance.

*The Scripture of Liberated Beings from Foreign Lands* consists of texts from the primordial caverns of the empty void, chapters of spontaneous origin. It is said that from the Supreme Perfected and Imperial Sovereigns down to those who study immortality and attain the Dao, none fail to receive its teachings from the Great Void.

*The Yellow Plain of the Supreme Lord* and *The Forty-Four Directions* are both texts from above the Nine Heavens, hidden writings of the Eight Assemblies. Thus, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao commanded the Supreme Perfected of the Grand Ultimate, the High Immortal of Shangqing, to compile and arrange their contents, combining them into *The Divine Formulas of the Yellow Plain*, forty-four in total.

*The Nine Vermilion Talismans of the Supreme Lord* and *The Inner Scripture of the Five Emperors’ True Essence* are formed from the qi of the Nine Heavens, celestial feathered chapters condensed into jade script.

The *Divine Tiger True Talismans of the Supreme Lord* were issued by the Celestial Parents of the Nine Heavens.

The *Golden Tiger and Jade Essence True Talismans of the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity* are the natural golden chapters of the Supreme Origin’s luminous radiance.

The *Inner True Talismans of the Divine Tiger’s Jade Cord of the Supreme Divine Lineage* were also issued by the Celestial Parents of the Nine Heavens.

The *Elegant Silk of the Jade Dawn’s Phoenix Terrace* contains the nine-phoenix script, melodies of sorrow and joy.

The *Perfected of the Dark Mound* are all formed from the spontaneous qi of the Nine Heavens.

Moreover, the *Melodies of Sorrow and Joy of the Jade Dawn* arose spontaneously upon the Phoenix Terrace of the empty void. Their numinous script illumines the five directions, their golden tones resonate through the ten heavens. The Nine Melodies of the Supreme Perfected were all cast in metal slips, inscribed in purple ink.

*The Eightfold Plain Scripture of the True Essence* is the Dao of the Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Clarity.

There are also *Earthbound Immortals*, who possess *The Discourse on the Eightfold Plain Scripture*, containing methods for ingesting royal qi and exhaling-inhaling.

Additionally, there is *The Discourse on the Ninefold Plain Scripture*, which concerns summoning spirits, commanding essences, and managing kitchens and inspecting souls.

*The Scripture of the Seven Cycles and Seven Transformations of the Divine Continent’s Dance of Heaven* states: All the treasured scriptures of Shangqing—three hundred scrolls, nine thousand jade instructions, and seven thousand talismanic diagrams—emerge from the primordial jade chapters of the Highest Origin, inheriting the spontaneous writings of the mysterious ancient Dao.

The above is from *The Jade Instructions of the Wondrous Writ of the Cavern Mystery’s Vermilion Script*.

*The Three-Nine Plain Language Jade Essence True Instructions*:
The Minister of the Left, the Azure Lad, said: *The Three-Nine Plain Language* derives from the incantations of the Nine Emperors and Three Perfected, regulating qi to prolong life, unlocking the numinous gates, and freshening the five viscera’s splendor.

The above is from *The Jade Essence True Instructions of the Three-Nine Plain Language*.

*The Ninefold Dragon Radiance and Vermilion Script of the Purple Phoenix*:
The Supreme Lord, dwelling in leisure upon the towering terrace of golden splendor and ninefold curves, expounded *The Ninefold Dragon Radiance and Vermilion Script of the Purple Phoenix of the Nine Heavens*.

The Supreme Lord’s six Jia plain memorials and cinnabar talismans, the Five Emperors’ inner true writings for communicating with spirits, and the sixty upper talismans of the left and right numinous flight.

All the above arose within the Nine Mysteries, condensing the pure yang qi to form jade script.

The above is from *The Ninefold Dragon Radiance and Vermilion Script of the Purple Phoenix*.

*The Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings of the Grand Ultimate’s Golden Writ*:
The Celestial King of the Primordial Origin and the Supreme Emperor rejoiced in the numinous auspices of the Great Void, beseeching the supreme Dharma from the Nine Heavens. They initiated vows and announced the numinous, purifying themselves in the courts of the heavens.

On that day, the sky suddenly darkened, the sun and moon dimmed by day, for three days and nights. Then the azure rooster heralded dawn, and nine suns blazed forth. The mysterious radiance of the eastern direction shone brilliantly. The Green Bird of the Primordial Origin and True Essence returned to soar, bearing in its beak a purple script that alighted upon the jade pavilion. Descending through the empty void, it divinely bestowed the script upon the Celestial King and the Supreme Emperor. Together, they ascended the lofty heavens, reverently receiving the true writ.

*The Green Essentials and Purple Writ of the Golden Root’s Many Scriptures* are chapters spontaneously generated from the empty mystery, received by the True Kings of the Nine Heavens.

*The Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* was born together with the Primordial Origin and received by the Supreme Lord.

The above is from *The Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings of the Grand Ultimate’s Golden Writ*.

*The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern’s True Scripture*:
The composition of this scripture was set in motion by the Primordial Celestial King of the Ten Directions of the Ancient Mysterious Subtlety.

The above is from *The Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern’s True Scripture*.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Vermilion Writ*:
*The Five Chapters of the Primordial Origin’s Cavern Mystery’s Numinous Treasure’s Vermilion Writ* existed prior to the Primordial Origin, within the empty cavern.

It is also said: *The Five Chapters of the Five Elders’ Numinous Treasure* is the Celestial Writ of the Primordial Origin, born within the empty cavern, the root of heaven and earth.

It is further said: *The Five Chapters of the Primordial Origin’s Vermilion Writ* is the spontaneous scripture of Shangqing, the mysterious tablets of the Nine Heavens’ inception, the numinous chapters of the empty cavern, which established heaven and earth and unfolded the myriad transformations.

The above is from *The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Vermilion Writ*.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Wisdom and Great Precepts*:
In the first year of the Kaihuang era, on the first day of the seventh month, the Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Origin bestowed upon the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao the *Dharma Text of the Upper Grade Wisdom Precepts* in the Long Mulberry Forest of the Floating Mountain of Yuchai in the Western Na Jade Country.

The above is from *The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Wisdom and Great Precepts*.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Perception of the Subtle and Stabilization of the Will*:
The Celestial Venerable said: "You both return to your seats. I wish to impart to you the essential instructions on perceiving the subtle and stabilizing the will. Its essentials are simple and easy; from ease comes enlightenment—is this not delightful?"

The Two Perfected Ones said: "Perceiving the subtle and stabilizing the will—is there a scripture for this?"

The Celestial Venerable said: "There are no written words."

The Two Perfected Ones said: "This is like running into a wall, a bottomless great folly. If there are no written words, how can one attain enlightenment?"

He replied: "At that very moment, all scriptures were originally without written words. Are not today’s words also a scripture?"

The above is from *The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Perception of the Subtle and Stabilization of the Will*.

**Chapter on the Virtues of the Scripture**

The *Five Elderly Numinous Treasure’s Five True Writings* are the primordial celestial texts of the Originator, born within the Void and Cavern, serving as the root of Heaven and Earth. Their numinous majesty and wondrous nobility, their dharma teachings and awe-inspiring authority, unfold across the Three Primes, their virtue crowning all heavens. They possess fourteen virtues:

1. Their virtue is like the Great Void—boundless and unobstructed, the ancestral origin of the Originator.
2. Their virtue is like Non-Being, where Non-Being gives rise to Being, and Being returns to Non-Being.
3. Their virtue is like the Great Dao—its numinous might vast and expansive, the treasure of divine luminaries.
4. Their virtue is like Heaven—serene, clear, and loftily empty, its vast covering without limit.
5. Their virtue is like Earth—open, receptive, and boundlessly supportive, bearing all without exception.
6. Their virtue is like the Three Luminaries—illuminating all heavens, universally bestowing radiance.
7. Their virtue is like the Lofty Perfected—expounding the mysterious teachings, the most revered within Heaven.
8. Their virtue is like the Divine Humans—universally delivering all beings, universally receiving spontaneity.
9. Their virtue is like the Great Mystery—pure, open, and expansively established, the capital of divine immortals.
10. Their virtue is like clouds and rain—all the myriad things universally receive their shade and moisture.
11. Their virtue is like wind—all the myriad things receive its dispersal and release.
12. Their virtue is like the four seasons—all the myriad things receive their completion and growth.
13. Their virtue is like Mount Tai—preserving and securing the primordial destiny, pacifying the numinous and anchoring the spirits.
14. Their virtue is like the Great River—boundless and unobstructed, embracing all without exception.

These wondrous and weighty true writings embody these fourteen virtues. Their virtue is thus—towering and lofty in model. Its measure is beyond reckoning, like the shade of mountains flowing with divine currents. Through ten thousand kalpas without end, it unfolds and illuminates the primordial transformation—none does not arise therefrom.

*From* The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Red Writings.

Laozi said: The *Supreme Numinous Treasure* has always existed before Heaven and Earth first arose, from countless kalpas past, naturally emerging from primordial chaos—it is the true essence of the Dao. In the Dao, it is the root of the Dao; in the dharma, it is the origin of the dharma. The divine humans of the ten directions all begin with the *Numinous Treasure*.

Laozi said: In the beginning of chaos, at the subtle and wondrous source, before the opening of creation, there already existed the *Numinous Treasure’s* natural true writings, prior to the appearance of the Emperor. I am the profound gateway of the *Numinous Treasure’s* Great Dao; those who receive its essence become the spirits of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.

Laozi said: The *Supreme Numinous Treasure* arises from the formless Void and Cavern of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. The Great Dao’s constant movement within the boundless and non-active naturally coalesces into spontaneity—its nobility beyond naming, its reverence without superior. Thus, it is called *Supreme*. It encompasses all that is vast, penetrates all that is minute, its principle wondrous and unfathomable—the origin of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. In Heaven, the five stars circulate qi, the sun and moon radiate light; on Earth, the five peaks secure their positions, mountains stand tall and seas run deep; in humanity, the five constituents remain secure. Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could Heaven shine? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could Earth manifest form? Without the *Numinous Treasure*, how could humanity attain life? Thus, the teeming myriad things take me as their root, me as their gateway. Why am I the root and gateway? I possess the *Numinous Treasure’s* writings.

Laozi said: When a serpent obtains the *Numinous Treasure*, it transforms into a divine dragon; when a crow obtains it, it becomes a phoenix; when a common beast obtains it, it changes into a qilin; when an ordinary person obtains it, they are called a sage. What is a sage? One who possesses the *True Writings of Penetrating the Sage*, able to ingest them and wander playfully upon the Five Peaks, roam freely in the Void, transform the five viscera, alter their form and appearance, command ghosts and spirits, penetrate the subtle in the ten directions, appear and vanish unpredictably, ascend heights and ride clouds, journey afar in the lofty purity.

Laozi said: *Numinous* means penetrating the Dao—able to penetrate the Great Dao’s utmost numinosity, thereby commanding the myriad spirits. *Treasure* means able to preserve in harmony with Heaven and Earth. Thus, the *Supreme Numinous Treasure* is the utmost reverence of the Dao.

Laozi said: When a state is about to prosper, it cultivates and attains these writings. If one desires wealth, honor, and agelessness, they must attain the *Numinous Treasure*. If the Son of Heaven obtains it, phoenixes will come to pay homage, the five stars will align in harmony, the sun and moon will radiate brilliance, the four directions will submit in reverence, the world will be clear and peaceful, no omens or evils will arise, the feudal lords will unite in allegiance, and his lifespan will equal Heaven and Earth, his myriad fortunes never declining. If a feudal lord obtains it, the constellations will harmonize their light, benefiting state and family, his position will ascend, and he will enjoy long life and enduring vision, forever secure from calamity. If a grandee obtains it, he will extend his years without end, attain noble rank and abundant emolument, and ascend to the status of prince.

*From* The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Five Praises.

The *Highest Three Primes’ Dispersal Scripture* is the true book of the Three Heavens of the Highest Purity, the flying writ of the jade tally of the Highest Perfected. The Upper Prime’s tally is the *Great Record of Heaven*, the Lower Prime’s tally is the *Jade Writ of Earth*, and the Middle Prime’s tally is the *Book of the Divine Immortals*.

The *Three Primes’ Writings* state: The jade tally’s writings emerge from the immortals of the Ninefold Mystery’s Void and Cavern, congealing the qi of spontaneity to form jade writings. The Nine Heavens divide and judge, the Three Ways unfold and clarify. Without these writings, the Three Luminaries would darken and dim, the Five Emperors would err in their positions, the Nine Movements would overturn and shift, and the Seven Lodges would scatter their essence. Without these writings, the Nine Lands would sink into the abyss, the Five Peaks would collapse, mountains and rivers would invert and topple. Without these writings, immortal officials would not descend, earthly officials would not govern, the names of the Nine Heavens’ above would not be inscribed in the mysterious register. One’s efforts in study would be in vain, and the Dao would have no means to be accomplished. Its method is lofty and wondrous. The Three Primes’ secret writings—those who obtain these writings will have their rank elevated to immortal minister.

*From* The Scripture of the Cavern Reality’s Three Primes’ Jade Tally.

The Dao states: The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* is the essential principle of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral origin of virtue and the Dao, revered by the highest sages, feared and obeyed by ghosts and spirits. Its height extends beyond the Nine Heavens, its depth penetrates below the Nine Earths. Its thousand transformations and myriad changes—all Dao is exhausted therein.

The Supreme Lord said: In my past lives, seeking divine immortality, I refined cinnabar and ingested mushrooms, merely attaining extended years. Though I lived for a thousand years or ten thousand ages, death still brought suffering. Though I possessed the strength to move mountains and halt rivers, to embrace and conceal the sun and moon, I could not escape the Three Paths and Eight Difficulties.

Later, I encountered the Most High Heavenly Worthy and obtained the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* along with its ritual fasts. Following the scripture’s instructions in cultivation for seventeen years, I attained the true Dao and thus beheld the good and evil of past, future, and present—the three times.

Dao Ling said: I do not yet understand the meaning of "Ascending the Mystery." I humbly beseech your compassion to expound and clarify it, that those of future karmic affinity may comprehend its profound subtleties.

The Dao said: Your inquiry is most essential. I shall now explain—listen carefully and do not forget. "Ascending" means "to rise above." All the great sages of the ten directions, the perfected who neither live nor die—none who attain the Dao fail to ascend beyond the Three Realms, to ascend to the Golden Towers. Their bodies are born of water and fire, their virtue harmonizes with emptiness. They encompass the purest essence, vast and boundless, above enveloping the heavens’ net without limit, below entering the bottomless subtlety of the infinitesimal. Ascending, they merge with the formless, their essence serene and spontaneous.

"Mystery" is the image of no-light, the form of no-thing. Approached, it has no head; pursued, it has no tail. Near, it cannot be drawn close; distant, it cannot be estranged. It governs the great subtlety—the Heaven within Heaven, the True within the True, the Spirit within the Spirit. Those who attain it are called "Ascending the Mystery."

Dao Ling said: Since attaining perfection, my body has ascended to the Mystery Palace. For nine years now, I have only just received and heard the *Wondrous Scripture of Ascending the Mystery*.

---

From the *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery*:

The Most High Lord Lao said: Among the great scriptures of the Daoist tradition, none surpass the Five Thousand Characters—the hymns of the Cavern Mystery and Cavern Reality. When this text is recited in emptiness and distance, it summons the descent of cloud chariots and jeweled canopies, dragon-drawn carriages, and ascension to heaven in broad daylight. The Five Thousand Characters are the ancestral origin of virtue and the Dao, the True within the True. Unsullied by defilement, they may be recited from beginning to end. Expounding their wondrous meaning brings order to kings and lords; fasting and reciting them causes the body to fly as an immortal.

From the *Cavern Mystery Scripture of Petitioning Inquiry*:

**On the Preservation and Loss of Scriptures**

The Heavenly Worthy said: I have surveyed all heavens from kalpas past to this day. The lofty sages, great spirits, and perfected of the upper heavens, as well as the flying immortals of the Nine Palaces and Five Peaks—none have failed to receive deliverance through the *Numinous Treasure* and thus become true. This scripture is revered and wondrous, delivering countless beings.

When great kalpas cycle and the heavens collapse, the earth sinks, the four seas merge into darkness, gold and jade dissolve, and the myriad Dao’s influences cease—this scripture alone endures, its methods unbroken. All miscellaneous methods—techniques of guiding and nourishing life, arts of transformation, scattered folk prescriptions—belong to the Six Heavens and the Desire Realm. When a minor kalpa arrives, these methods perish entirely, leaving no trace.

The various talismans of Supreme Clarity, the *Scriptures of the Great Peace*, and the *Greater and Lesser Sutras* circulate among the eighteen heavens above and below, within the Form Realm. When the great kalpa turns and heaven and earth are renewed, their texts still vanish, leaving no remnant.

The divine scriptures of the Three Caverns of the Jade Clarity’s Upper Dao—the *Tiger Script of Spirit Perfection*, the *Golden Writ and Jade Characters*, the *True Scripture of Numinous Treasure*—all issue from the Primordial Beginning and abide above the twenty-eight heavens of the Formless. When the kalpa cycles, their texts return to the Seven Jeweled Mystery Terrace atop the Jade Capital in the Great Luo Heaven of No-Form, untouched by calamity.

---

From the *Cavern Mystery Scripture of the Wondrous Wheel of the Dao*:

The Dao said: My scripture of the wondrous wheel has existed since kalpas beyond reckoning—like the dust of the earth or the sands of the Ganges, its duration defies comparison. Though heaven and earth rise and fall beyond count, and all other scriptures perish, mine remains unbroken. Turning with the wheel of fate, its teachings flourish ever more, delivering boundlessly. It is the most revered among scriptures, just as the heavens’ teachings flourish. Without this scripture, the Dao’s methods would not spread.

Thus, all teachings and doctrines begin with this scripture. Like the stars’ universal radiance, this scripture shines like the full moon—brightest among them, illuminating the ten directions. Like the Three Realms’ unending darkness, this scripture rises like the sun, universally illuminating all heavens with clarity. Like the flow of ten thousand rivers, this scripture is the abyss of the Scorching Valley—the source of the vast sea, to which all return. Like the height of Mount Sumeru, this scripture is the Mountain of the Jade Capital—encompassing all.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, enduring as long as heaven and earth. The primordial kings of the heavens, the lofty immortals and perfected of boundless number—none fail to obey its command. Thus, it universally saves beings. Whether one studies or not, it broadly opens the gate of the Dao: above, it governs the Three Luminaries; in the middle, it harmonizes yin and yang; below, it opens the myriad lives. All receive its sheltering shade, their seven ancestors delivered, lost souls rescued, the wounded and broken made whole. Like a boat ferrying people, it ensures the wheel of rebirth never ceases.

From the *Cavern Mystery Scripture of the Wheel of the Dao*:

**On Karmic Affinity with Scriptures**

The *Seven Sages’ Mystery Record* reverses the celestial texts. Some align in rhyme, some interweave by category, some unite above and below to form sounds. Some mark the true taboo names, some combine single and compound characters—all emerge from the primordial emptiness of the Cavern Mystery. The lofty sages compiled them to reveal the numinous texts. Later scholars who study their chapters, receiving the precious secrets, naturally ascend as immortals.

Yet there are the Six Harmonies and the Seven Harms. Treasure them, and they unite; neglect them, and they vanish. Those with karmic affinity must diligently cultivate sincerity: observe long fasts on sacred peaks, seek distant secluded mountains, burn incense and perform rites, recite scriptures morning and night, abandon all stray thoughts, and focus the mind on the Supreme Perfection. Only then may the Mystery descend, and one ascend in broad daylight.

Among later scholars, some whose names are not inscribed on the Mystery Register yet obtain the precious scriptures—all because their past lives bore abundant virtue, whose blessings extend to them. Or they possess hidden merits, their aspirations surpassing the crowd, their single-minded austerities moving the Jade Emperor. The Four Poles record their deeds, the Five Peaks inscribe their names, leading them to encounter scripture masters and receive the precious texts.

If one diligently cultivates without violating the Seven Injuries, the Perfected Ones will descend to bestow the true scriptures. Those who attain the sacred texts of the *Mystic Register of the Supreme Sages* do so because in primordial antiquity they possessed the destiny of flying immortals—inscribed in the unseen patterns before birth, their names retroactively recorded in the *Mystic Void’s* annals. Having received the human Dao, their names were registered in the *Azure Palace*, protected by the Four Directors, attested by the Five Emperors, their essence bound in the *Jade Void*, their roots planted in the *Purple Web*. Their bones radiate extraordinary light, their entire form harmonizing with immortality. The Four Poles secretly descend, conferring the precious texts in concealment. The *Supreme Unity* revises their celestial register, the *Director of Destinies* alters their years. Their souls become steadfast, their spirits secure; the six bones crystallize into perfection, the myriad spirits fully manifest—thus do they ascend as Supreme Immortals.

The Most High Sage Emperor Lord declares: All who obtain the *Mystic Register of the Seven Sages* and traverse the Nine Empyreans, though they have not yet ascended, have their names registered in the *Azure Palace* and receive talismans from the Five Peaks. The officials of all numinous mountains, rivers, and seas guard their bodies. Twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens attend the sacred scriptures, serving the Way and practicing perfection. This is the spontaneous convergence of the Mystic’s destined meeting, a principle inherent in nature. The Supreme Sages all have their names retroactively inscribed in the *Azure Register*, their positions aligned with the ranks of immortal ministers. Only when the Way is complete, the Four Perfected Ones arrive at their chambers, and the numinous chariot descends, may they ascend at dawn. The standards of ascent and descent follow their rank, advancing in immortality according to their grade. This Way is profoundly subtle, not something ordinary study can glimpse or hear.

The Most High Sage Emperor Lord declares: Those with jade bones and cinnabar script, whose names are listed in the *Imperial Chart*, may behold the *Mystic Register of the Seven Sages*. Those with golden marrow and purple viscera, whose names are inscribed on golden tablets, may behold the *Hidden Writings of the Inner Texts*. Those with extraordinary and wondrous features, purple wombs and jade networks, whose names are marked in the *Upper Register of Certainty*, may behold the *Upper Scroll of the White Tablet*. Those with flowing essence and purple radiance, inner illumination entwining their exterior, their precious treasuries and golden countenances, whose names are recorded in the *Jade Void*, may behold the *Azure Register’s* scriptures. Those with divine destiny matching the celestial charts, jade embryos and purple voids, whose names are inscribed in the *Eastern Florescence*, may behold the *Examination Text of the Seven Injuries*.

The Most High Sage Emperor Lord declares: Later scholars who delight in diligent cultivation, harmonize with others through gentle conduct, embrace the Four Greatnesses with magnanimity, and accommodate all things with tolerance—such persons have their mystic names inscribed in the *Imperial Register*, their purple characters woven into the *Jade Scrolls*. They receive qi from the *Divine Charts*, their virtue flourishing to unite with immortality. Internally, the *Great Ultimate* oversees their illumination; externally, they become the lineage of the *Grand Artificer*. When their merit is complete and the Way perfected, they naturally ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

*—Excerpted from the* Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Register of the Seven Sages of the Cavern Realms*, spoken by the Lady of Purple Tenuity to the Queen Mother of the West:*

The Nine Qi forge and temper; the Supreme Unity moves the spirit. Though you have attained human form—of which there are many—without the *Numinous Tablet of the Supreme Unity*, the *Golden Names of the Three Origins*, the *Hidden Talismans of the Director of Destinies*, or the *Purple Registers of the Five Elders*, even if born through the qi of heaven, you cannot hear or see the Supreme Way. Without the *Purple Tablets of the Mystic Palace*, the *Precious Names of the Highest Sovereign*, the *Jade Register of the Supreme Unity*, the *Hidden Charts of the Eastern Florescence*, the *Divine Inscriptions of the Three Origins*, or the *Triple-Soul Attestations of the Supreme Emperor*, though you may briefly hear the Supreme Way, you cannot cultivate it, or if you do, you cannot persist. Persistence may lack firm

**Chapter on the Transmission of the Scriptures by the Host of Sages**

The Yellow Emperor said: The texts of the Great Cavern and Jade Clarity are cultivated by the august Highest Perfected; they are not transmitted to those of the earthly realm. The scriptures of the Cavern Mystery and Highest Clarity are, in due time, bestowed below to instruct the most devoted scholars. The books of the Cavern Spirit and the Three Sovereigns are transmitted to the world below to stabilize transformation, assist the state, and succor the myriad people.
— *From the* Scripture of the Cavern Spirit *(Dongshen Jing)*

The Highest Lord Emperor addressed the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad: All the celestial writings of the thirty-six nations and the sounds of the nine earths are the natural script and voice of the Primordial Cavern and the Void. From the Celestial Perfected and Emperor-Sages down to those who study immortality and attain the Dao, none fail to receive these sounds from the Great Void and bear their texts as they wander.
— *From the* Scripture of the Cavern Perfection on the Release of Foreign Lands *(Dongzhen Waiguo Fangpin Jing)*

They bound the qi of the Nine Origins and the Orthodox Unity to compose verses of sorrow and joy, which were illuminated upon the Mystic Terrace. Each character measured a *zhang* in size, their radiant patterns resplendent, penetrating the Nine Heavens. Seven-jeweled floral light streamed and shone upon Highest Clarity. The Master of the Mystic Capital received them from the Great Void, later inscribing them in phoenix-script and transmitting them to the Most High Great Dao Lord. The Dao Lord passed them to the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, who in turn transmitted them to the Azure Lad, Great Lord of the Eastern Sea’s Square Cauldron.

The Queen Mother of the West conveyed them to the Celestial Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity, who bestowed them upon the Sage Lord of the Golden Portal. The Sage Lord of the Golden Portal transmitted them to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad, who passed them to the Lord of the Western City, charging him to deliver them to later students destined to become Perfected Ones.
— *From the* Cavern Perfection’s Jade Essence True Formulae of the Three Origins’ Plain Speech *(Dongzhen Sanyuan Suyu Yujing Zhenjue)*

The *Lang* Writings of the Great Empyrean are the melodies of the Flying Empyrean’s Celestial Kings. The Imperial Chapters of the Jade Texts are the writings of the Nine Heavens above. Both originated with the Primordial Beginning in the natural Void Cavern.

The Great Perfected King passed them to the Perfected of Mount Taihua, the Lord of Longevity of the Three Heavens, the Perfected of Great Harmony, the Old Master of the Eastern Flower, the Supreme Overseer of Prohibitions of the Southern Culmen, the Central Attendant of the Western Terrace, the Central Perfected of the Northern Emperor, the Great Numinous Prince, the Perfected Consort of the Great Numinous, the Vermilion Essence Jade Lad, the Master of the Dark Valley, the Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount, the Royal Bridge of Mount Zhong, the Perfected of Purple Yang, the Lord of the Western City, the Central August Master, and Zhao Boxuan—all of whom cultivated and received these scriptures.

— *From the* Scripture of the Cavern Perfection on the Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings *(Dongzhen Yupai Jindang Jing)*

— *From the* Scripture of the Cavern Perfection on the Inner Writings of the Six Jia of the Numinous Flight *(Dongzhen Lingfei Liujia Neiwen Jing)*

The Elder of the Nine Heavens said: The *Central Record of the Embryonic Essence of the Nine Elixirs’ Upper Transformation* was transmitted by the Great Emperor Lord to the Lady of the Southern Culmen, who passed it to the Celestial Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity. The Celestial Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity conveyed it to the Later Sage, the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad. The Azure Lad further compiled and arranged its sequence for application, entrusting it to the Perfected of the Western City.
— *From the* Central Record of the Embryonic Essence of the Cavern Perfection *(Dongzhen Taijing Zhongji)*

The Most High Jade Dawn, the Lofty Sage Lord, received them from the Nine Mysteries. After seven thousand years, he transmitted them to the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Great Spirit of the Eastern Flower, the Azure Lad of the Square Cauldron, the Divine King of the Fusang Sun Valley, and the Perfected of Pure Emptiness. They swore an oath upon Highest Clarity, rending gold as their pledge. Those whose bodies bear these texts shall vanish into the eight directions; those who cultivate their arts shall ride the void and mount the skies. They are received orally and must not be recklessly transmitted.
— *From the* Scripture of the Cavern Perfection on the Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth and the Communion with the Elixir’s Radiance *(Dongzhen Danjing Tongjing Yindi Bashu Jing)*

All the three hundred volumes of the precious scriptures of Highest Clarity, the nine thousand sections of jade formulae, and the seven thousand chapters of talismans and diagrams originate from the Most High Jade Emperor. They are endowed with the natural writings and the Dao of the Primordial Antiquity. This Dao is secretly preserved in the heavens above, within the Palace of Great Existence. The transmission of the jade texts is entrusted to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad.
— *From the* Scripture of the Cavern Perfection on the Seven Turns and Seven Transformations of the Heavenly Dance *(Dongzhen Qizhuan Qibian Wutian Jing)*

The *True Scripture of the Eight Simplicities* is the Dao of the Jade Emperor of the Mystic Clarity. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme August transmitted this text to the Celestial Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity, the Lord of the Purple Essence of the Three Origins, and the Lord of the Primordial Yang and the Ancient. These three lords received the text and practiced it. After attaining the Dao, they transmitted it to the Most High Dao Lord, who passed it to the Later Sage, Lord Li. Lord Li conveyed it to the Perfected of the Great Void, Red Pine of the Southern Culmen, charging him to bestow it upon those who study the Dao and whose names are already inscribed in gold. The Way of the August Splendor of the Sun and Moon was transmitted by the Primordial Beginning to the Nine Celestial Kings of the Most High Jade Emperor. The Elder of the Nine Heavens inscribed its text upon the Western Tortoise Mountain within the Void Mystery, where it was mystically bestowed upon the Queen Mother of the West. The Most High Great Dao Lord received it from the Nine Mysteries and transmitted it to the Great Emperor Lord of Fusang. The Golden Portal Emperor Lord received it from the Northern Origin and passed it to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad. The Great Emperor transmitted it to the Four Poles’ Perfected Ones. The Dao of the Primordial Antiquity is perpetuated through the succession of qi, the transmission from Perfected to Perfected.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Eight Simplicities Perfected Scripture of the Cavernous Truth*. In former times, the Three Lords—the Grand Thearch, the Celestial Thearch, and the Grand Tenuity—received the Mysterious Cinnabar Upper Scripture from the Most High Great Dao Lord. Having practiced and perfected the Dao, they ascended to replenish the Perfected of the Jade Thearch. On the day of their ascent into the clouds, the Grand Thearch transmitted the scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Most High Celestial Thearch Lord transmitted it to the Southern Culmen Supreme Origin Lord; and the Grand Tenuity Celestial Thearch Lord transmitted it to the Golden Portal Sage Lord. The Sage Lord transmitted it to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad, and the Azure Lad transmitted it to Master Juan.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Grand Tenuity Celestial Thearch Lord’s Mysterious Cinnabar Upper Scripture*. The Most High Treasure Chapters were transmitted to the Grand Thearch Lord, the Grand Thearch Lord to the Celestial Thearch Lord, the Celestial Thearch Lord to the Grand Tenuity Celestial Thearch Lord, the Celestial Thearch to the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, and the Golden Portal Emperor Lord entrusted them to the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Simplicity and Numinous Lesser Possession Wondrous Scripture*. The Nine Reds are the qi of the Nine Heavens, soaring in dark-feathered splendor, congealing into jade script. The Primordial Beginning Elder transmitted them to the Most High Great Dao Lord; the Primordial Celestial King transmitted them to the Southern Culmen Supreme Origin Lord; the Most High transmitted them to the Fusang Grand Thearch; the Grand Thearch transmitted them to the Grand Tenuity Celestial Thearch Lord; the Grand Tenuity Celestial Thearch Lord transmitted them to the Later Sage Golden Portal Emperor Lord; the Golden Portal Emperor Lord transmitted them to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad; the Azure Lad transmitted them to the Southern Culmen Supreme Origin Lord; the Supreme Origin Lord transmitted them to Master Hongya; Master Hongya transmitted them to the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate—all transmitted through the succession of qi.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Nine Reds Mottled Talisman Inner Perfected Scripture*. Such are the phoenix scripts of the Nine Heavens, the melodies of sorrow and joy, the Dark Mound Grand Perfected—all formed from the natural qi of the Nine Heavens. The numinous script manifests its marvels within the Void Mystery, enduring through ninety thousand kalpas. The Dark Capital Elder received it from the Grand Numinous and transmitted it to the Most High Great Dao Lord; the Dao Lord transmitted it to the Supreme Ultimate Perfected; the Perfected transmitted it to the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea Fangzhu.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Phoenix Terrace Melodies of Simplicity Upper Scripture*. Formerly, the Supreme Origin Lady transmitted the hidden script to the Jade Maiden of Grand Harmony, and the Jade Maiden of Grand Harmony transmitted it to the Young Yang Lord.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Jade Clarity Hidden Writings Scripture*. The Transcendent King of the Dark Capital formerly received it from the Three Elders of the Grand Tenuity; the Lord of the Western Citadel formerly received it from the Queen Mother of Tortoise Mountain.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Grand Tenuity Yellow Writings Scripture*. "Azure Essence" is an alternate name for the Purple Clarity Emperor Lord, who received the Purple Writings and Wondrous Oral Instructions of the Primordial Thearch—all essential secrets of the host of scriptures, the writings of the Nine Heavens above, the hidden texts of the Eight Assemblies. The Jade Thearch commanded the Highest General Transcendent Lord to compile and collate the treasure catalog, uniting them into a corpus of scriptures, inscribed upon purple-glowing silk and gold tablets as chapters. All derive from the Dao of the Supreme Sovereign and Primordial Antiquity, compiled by the lofty sages, and transmitted to the Azure Essence Emperor Lord. The Emperor Lord transmitted them to the Supreme Void Nine Numinous Dao Lords; the Dao Lords transmitted them to the Grand Simplicity High Numinous Cavernous Radiance Dao Lord; the Dao Lord transmitted them to the Southern Culmen Supreme Origin Lord; the Supreme Origin Lord transmitted them to the Celestial Thearch Lord; the Celestial Thearch Lord transmitted them to the Grand Tenuity Celestial Thearch Lord; the Celestial Thearch Lord transmitted them to the Later Sage Nine Mysteries Emperor Lord; the Emperor Lord transmitted them to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Azure Essence Purple Writings Scripture*.

The *Golden Perfected Jade Radiance Eight Effulgences Flying Scripture* originated above the Nine Heavens, prior to the Primordial Effulgence. Mysterious light flowed and reflected, now present, now absent—dark essence gleaming like mist, illuminating the cavernous jade palace, accumulating for over seven thousand kalpas. Its script is most luminous, visible above the Void Mystery and within the Grand Void, unfathomable upon gazing, indestructible even if defaced. Thus, in the first year of the Jianshi era, the Elder of the Nine Heavens received it from the Void Mystery and transmitted it to the Primordial Celestial King, the Vast Life Grand Perfected, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Azure Perfected Youth, the Five Elders of the Upper Perfected, the Thirty-Nine Thearchs, the Supreme Sovereign Master, the Myriad Origins Dao Lord, the Southern Culmen Supreme Origin Purple Simplicity Three Origin Lords, the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, the Grand Simplicity Three Origin Lords, and the Grand Perfected Lady. The Supreme Sovereign Master transmitted it to the Purple Clarity Emperor Lord; the Primordial Celestial King transmitted it to Master Yellowstone and the Three Heavens Jade Youth; the Most High Great Dao Lord transmitted it to the Eastern Sea Youth and the Purple Tenuity Lady. The Later Sage Nine Mysteries Golden Portal Emperor Lord entrusted it to the Most Exalted Minister, the Azure Lad, the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, and the Lord of the Western Citadel. Thus, the treasure instructions were all transmitted orally from Perfected to Perfected.

The above is from the *Supreme Perfection Golden Perfected Jade Radiance Eight Effulgences Flying Scripture*.

The above is from the *Scripture of the Highest Golden Mystery Feathered Chapters of the Cavern Realms*.

The Most High Great Dao Lord addressed the Northern Culmen Perfected Duke, saying: "The Way of the Nine Stars’ Upper Dharma and Mysterious Reflection was received by me from the Primordial Beginning. Through seven hundred million kalpas, amidst the formation and decay of heaven and earth, the rise and fall of the ten thousand kinds, this Way alone endures. Even now, I cultivate it above the clouds and cannot forget it in due season, for my mind delights in its loftiness and wonder, and I cherish the encounters of those who receive it. Those who come to life only learn the flight of the fledgling swallow yet know not the method of wandering in darkness and treading the void—how then may they enter the gates of the layered heavens and witness the beginning and end of heaven and earth? Without this Way, you shall remain estranged from the Nine Dawns and the Lady of the Transcendent Domain, though you bear the empty title of imperial registry and soar in lofty eminence. You may ride cloud-dragons and roam the Five Peaks, merely avoiding death—but to tread the Dipper’s handle, wander the Flowery Dawn, and ascend the Jade Clarity, such remains beyond your reach. When governing the kalpic fortunes, sealing the ten heavens, examining the mysterious registers, and administering the divine immortals, you ought to receive this Dharma to govern the ten thousand lives. Now I transmit it to you—guard it well and cultivate it in secret!"

In the Heaven of Immeasurable Longevity, beneath the Flowery Dawn with golden sheep and silver geese arrayed in ranks, the Perfected Duke received the oral instructions and cultivated them, transmitting them further to the Azure Lad of the Square Cauldrons.

The above is from the *Scripture of the Cavern Realms’ Nine Ways of Returning to the Origin and Flying Feathered Writings*.

Formerly, the Most High Great Dao Lord received the *Flying Feathered Writings*, the *Nine Perfected Ascending Mysterious Record*, the precious words of the Purple Texts and Green Gold characters, and the Way of Treading the Void and Treading the Floating Scenery from the Void August Perfected Dao Lord of the Mysterious Clarity Upper Palace. Later, the Most High Dao Lord transmitted its essentials to the Upper Clarity Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Upper Prime Grand Simplicity Lord, who in turn transmitted it to the Celestial Thearch Lord of Grand Tenuity. The Emperor Lord practiced its true secrets and transmitted it to the Yellow Scenery Lord of the Dawn Center. The Yellow Scenery Lord transmitted it to the August Initial Purple Numinous Lord, who transmitted it to the Central Yellow Elder Lord. The Yellow Elder Lord transmitted it to the Nine Subtleties Grand Perfected, the Jade Guardian Golden Portal Most Exalted Minister, and the Grand Controller of Destinies, High Master of the Dawn. The Azure Lad Grand Lord taught this text to those who would become Perfected Ones.

The above is from the *Scripture of the Most High Flying Feathered Writings of the Cavern Realms*.

The Six Heavenly Writs of the Orthodox Dharma of the Upper Clarity Pure Tenuity Heaven were transmitted by the Primordial Beginning to the Nine Heavens’ Father and Mother, the Myriad Beginnings Master.

The *Great Admonitions of the Wisdom of Observing the Body* were recited by the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King and the Most High Lofty Sage Lord as they ascended the hall of the Cavern Realms, transmitting them to the Celestial Thearch of Grand Tenuity and the High Perfected Kings and Dukes of the Grand Culmen.

The Supreme Mysterious Unity Perfected said: The *Wondrous Scripture of the Dharma Wheel of Admonitions of the Supreme Perfected Unity*, once transmitted by the Supreme Void Sovereign to the Supreme Great Dao Lord, was passed by the Dao Lord to the Celestial Thearch of Grand Tenuity. The Celestial Thearch transmitted it to the Later Sage Golden Portal Emperor Lord, who commanded that it be entrusted to the immortal ministers, dukes, and kings who had already attained perfection, without transmitting it to the middling immortals.

The above is from the *Scripture of the Dharma Wheel of the Cavern Mystery*.

**Chapter on the Time Limits for Transmitting Scriptures**

The *Precious Scriptures of the Highest Clarity* comprise three hundred scrolls, nine thousand jade instructions, and seven thousand talismanic diagrams. According to the old regulations, they were transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. Since the Six Heavens withdrew and the Three Ways became properly illuminated, the cycles of destiny have accelerated. As the Dao now responds to the times, the regulations have been revised: transmission is permitted every seven hundred years. If within those seven hundred years there appears one whose sincerity and bone-essence align with the mysterious register of the Highest Clarity, they may receive transmission in accordance with the covenant.

The above is from the *Scripture of the Seven Turns and Seven Transformations Dancing in Heaven of the Cavern Reality*.

For all those who possess the *Feathered Scripture of Flight of the Supreme* and ascend through the Nine Ways of Mysterious Ascension, transmission is permitted once every three thousand years, with six transmissions allowed. If one encounters a suitable recipient, the teachings may be conferred in a single day.

According to the statutes of the Nine Heavens, it emerges once every ninety thousand years.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord further instructed the Azure Lad: The Nine Heavens have their prohibitions, and transmission occurs but once in ten thousand kalpas. Now, as the cycles of destiny converge and qi returns to the Highest Clarity, the Dao’s course responds to the Golden Terrace. Following the mysterious statutes, if within seven hundred years a suitable recipient appears, three transmissions are permitted.

The *Feathered Scripture of Treading the Celestial Net* of the Supreme, inscribed within the inner register of the Nine Luminaries Lord and the Nine Star Ladies, is a text of hidden transformations, the esoteric Way of the Lofty Void, and the forbidden writings of the High Sovereign Jade Emperor. According to the statutes of the Nine Heavens, it emerges once every ten thousand kalpas. Since the beginning of the Kaihuang era, the reckoning of destiny has accelerated. By imperial decree, the Supreme Great Dao Lord has transmitted it to later students who are destined to become Perfected, permitting three transmissions every nine thousand years. If within those nine thousand years a suitable recipient appears, instantaneous transmission is allowed.

The time limits for transmission conclude here—

**Chapter on Light Transmission and Punishment**

The Fusang Great Emperor shall transmit the scriptures to the Four Perfected Ones of the Supreme Ultimate, consulting the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise. The Queen Mother addressed the Great Emperor, saying: In the era of the Supreme August, those who studied and beheld the precious texts, thereby ascending to Jade Clarity, all cultivated the secret and numinous Dao in silence, never uttering it aloud nor revealing it to others. They subtly sensed the utmost quiescence, thereby attaining the Supreme Perfected. Thus, the Dao values concealment and stillness, transforming without form and emerging without sound.

Since I received the true scriptures from the Nine Heavens, countless kalpas have passed, yet I have transmitted them to fewer than three persons. By the end of the Central August Prime, I reached the Northern Prime Heaven, the land of Xina, the Mountain of the Mirror People’s Crows, and the Peak of Qilai. Within the Numinous Palace, I concentrated the qi of the Nine Mysteries and the Orthodox Unity, coalescing it into characters. Later, the Golden Portal Emperor of the Nine Mysteries of the Later Saints beheld the numinous text. By the mandate of the Immortal Capital, brushes were set in motion to transcribe it, and an oath was sworn to Heaven to cultivate the Dao. Upon its completion, he ascended to the Golden Portal.

The Most High, deeming me reckless in divulging celestial treasures, stripped me of my title as a Perfected of the True Origin and demoted me to a scattered numinous official. Only after five hundred years was I restored to my original Perfected state.

The Primordial Beginning established the offices of the Four Departments and the Five Emperors among the divine soldiers precisely to inspect leaks and punish them with the Wind Blade. How can one not be cautious!

Later learners are as numerous as the forest, yet not one attains immortality—why? Their intent lies in the reckless disclosure of Daoist texts, banishing celestial Perfected. Since the Dao does not descend, heavenly punishments subtly manifest. Advancing and retreating, they lose resolve, dying alone in empty mountains, their efforts in vain, their regret beyond words!

The Dao does not reveal itself without diligence, nor does it act without it. Upon beholding true scriptures, one should secretly cultivate and seek the numinous. The divine Perfected are easily moved; one may attain immortality in a matter of days.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Eightfold Simplicity True Scripture*.

The great characters of the Celestial August, Terrestrial August, and Human August of the Highest Clarity all contain wondrous and subtle methods and Cavern-Mysterious precious texts. Without a golden name in the Azure Palace of Fangzhu, one cannot know of them. Those who possess these texts yet transmit them to unworthy recipients, who tread upon them with impurity, disrespect the numinous, and violate their prohibitions, shall cause their seven ancestors to suffer interrogation, be condemned to the right-hand offices, endure mountain fires, and undergo transformation after each tribulation, reborn into non-human destinies.

The *Cavern-Mysterious Numinous Treasure Upper Scripture*, the talismans and jade formulas of the Great and Lesser Kalpas, the precious texts of the Highest Clarity, and the Dao of the Mysterious Cavern—without the Jade Bone, the Mysterious Chart, the Purple Characters, and the Green Names, one cannot know of them. Those who possess these texts yet fail to revere them, defile the true texts with disdain, and recklessly disclose them, banishing the non-Perfected, shall violate their prohibitions. Their seven ancestors shall be interrogated and condemned to the right-hand offices, punished with the trials of the Knife Mountain and Fire Realm, the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings. After three tribulations, they shall pass, reborn into non-human destinies.

The *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Highest Cavern True Scripture*, the *Wondrous Scripture of the Great Simplicity of the Primordial Numinous*, the *Five Elders’ Treasure Scripture of the Female Jade Tablet*, the *Purple Writ of the Golden Flower Cavern Chamber’s Upper Text*, the *Primal Register of Tortoise Mountain*, the *Jade Chapters of the Highest Clarity’s Great Empyrean Jade Writ of the White Tablet and Golden Root*, and the *Precious Scrolls of the Upper Palace*—thirty-one scrolls in total—these are the independent formulas, the Dao of the Highest Mystery’s radiant reflection. The Cavern-Heaven Jade Clarity’s precious texts are the utmost for those who have already attained Perfection. Those with golden offices and jade treasuries, whose names are inscribed on the Emperor’s tablets and registers in the Purple Court, upon receiving these scriptures, if they fail to uphold the regulations, show negligence and disbelief toward the celestial Perfected, and recklessly disclose the sacred texts, allowing the world to see and hear of them, shall be reported by the Jade Lads. Their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer interrogation.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Four Poles Bright Regulations*.

The *Hidden Text of the Moon’s Soul in Cinnabar Characters of the Purple Writ*—if one recklessly speaks of it and informs three persons, one shall die and become a ghostly official, unable to attain immortality.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Scripture of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence*.

The Most High said: Those who leak celestial texts and hidden writings shall be reported to the Heavenly Emperor. Their three generations of ancestors shall be executed, and the Three Offices shall be ordered to sever their lives. In life, they shall suffer water and fire; in death, they shall become lowly ghosts.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Most High Eightfold Simplicity True Scripture*.

The Highest Sage Lord said: Those who receive the texts of the Seven Sages’ Mysterious Record, the Nine Empyreans’ White Tablet, and the Azure Register, yet whose masters do not swear oaths, recklessly disclose the precious texts, or whose disciples receive them without faith, secretly peruse the jade scrolls—all shall suffer the interrogation of the Wind Blade. Their seven ancestors shall be condemned, endure the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings, and remain unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas. The Five Emperors’ divine soldiers constantly investigate leaks; one must be vigilant in upholding and practicing them.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Seven Sages’ Primal Record Scripture*.

Those who receive the methods of the *Formulas and Verses of the Crooked Simplicity* must not engage with others but seek subtle responses. Only when a suitable recipient is found may they transmit it. To transmit it to an unworthy person or recklessly disclose the precious scriptures shall cause one’s seven generations of ancestors to suffer dark interrogation in hell.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Scripture of the Crooked Simplicity’s Formulas and Verses*.

Those with predestined affinity to behold these texts must have a record of immortality. The Jade Emperor’s precious secrets are not transmitted to the world. Those who recklessly speak of them shall be pierced by the Nine Heavens’ *Ci Jian*, reported to the Emperor Lord. The Most High shall order the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers to punish their persons, and their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer interrogation by the Water Office.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Azure Essentials and Purple Writ Scripture*.

Without a mysterious name on the Cinnabar Terrace or green characters in Jade Clarity, one cannot recklessly transmit them. Unless one possesses a spiritually exceptional bone, ascends the Mysterious Peak to swear an oath, and arrays golden and azure pledges to the numinous, these texts cannot be transmitted, nor their sounds heard. Those who recklessly disclose them shall cause their seven ancestors to be condemned, their own lives lost, and endure the trials of the Three Wretched Paths.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Jade Pendant’s Hidden Origin and Cavern-Flying Inner Writ Scripture*.

The Most High Dao Lord said: Those with predestined affinity to behold these texts must have a spiritually exceptional nature and an assured share of immortality. These divine scriptures are not transmitted to the world. Those who recklessly speak of them shall be pierced by the Three Heavens’ *Ci Jian*, reported to the Emperor Lord, who shall proclaim their sins as transgressions of disclosure.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Yellow Plain’s Forty-Four Directions Scripture*.
To transmit these in violation of the precepts is to betray one’s oath, causing three generations of ancestors to be tried by the Water Bureau, oneself to forfeit all hope of immortality, and to die as a lowly ghost.

Those who align with the True must receive these texts; the receiver shall treasure and conceal them, never recklessly transmitting them. To disclose these numinous writings is to cause nine generations of ancestors to be tried and condemned to the Bureau of Ghosts.

To the right: From the *Cavern-Perfected Great Empyrean’s Numinous Jade Writ Scripture*.
The method of transmission requires master and disciple to pass them on in reverence for the Mysterious and Secret. To transmit to the unworthy, to disregard the statutes, is to betray and profane the Heavenly Treasures, to violate the oath with negligence and disdain. One shall die as a lowly ghost, and seven generations of ancestors shall suffer the punishments of wind and fire. Unless bound by the same covenant, one ought to seal one’s lips.

Should a master transmit without regard to the proper time, the disciple shall personally endure the trials of the Wind Blade.

The Nine Reds are the soaring, mysterious feathered writ of the Nine Heavens’ qi, congealed into jade script. To recklessly disclose or transmit them to the unworthy is to cause seven generations of ancestors to be tried, and oneself to perish in the River Source.

It is further said: Those who receive without invoking the Heavenly Numinous shall have the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the scripture report them to the Most High, punished by the Five Thearchs’ divine soldiers. Those who recklessly disclose shall be punished with the annihilation of nine generations of ancestors, while those who receive without swearing an oath shall bring calamity upon seven generations of ancestors, their own bodies subjected to the Wind Blade, as decreed by the Natural Heavenly Scriptures.

Thus the Upper Prime Lord declared to the Five Thearchs: “Scriptures must not be transmitted without an oath, nor received without proper invocation, lest their truth be lost. The responsibility for life and death in such matters rests with both parties; scholars ought to adhere to the text and uphold it.”

The Most High said: Those of you in future generations who wish to propagate the numinous inner teachings must establish eleven matters to gain the trust of all people, so that you may then transmit this scripture.

First, maintain perfect sincerity, with no inner corruption.
Second, relieve and aid the orphaned, the elderly, and the poor, with a heart of compassion.
Third, exhort others to shun evil and cultivate goodness, as earnestly as between father and son.
Fourth, seek no fame or reputation, regarding gain and loss as one.
Fifth, in secluded places, diligently perform rites and prostrations, cultivate all merits and virtues, as if in the midst of a great assembly.
Sixth, do not deceive, so that the people trust you as they trust the four seasons.
Seventh, suddenly abandon glory and splendor, so that rank does not cling to your person.
Eighth, forsake your wife and children from afar, dwelling alone in quietude.
Ninth, draw near to the wise and learned, broadly inquiring into the good Dao.
Tenth, the Dao abides in darkness and obscurity—do not cling stubbornly to certainty. Discuss and deliberate with the worthy, and do not insist on your own views.
Eleventh, always practice humility and reverence toward others.

These are the eleven matters for propagating the inner teachings; you must diligently study and uphold them.

The Most High addressed Ziming, saying: Those who study the Dao, upon hearing the Dharma, should be as one starving craves food; upon meeting one who may be their teacher, they should be as one ill finding a physician. Why cling to humility and deference? They should be like the poor of the world, who, for the sake of clothing and food, borrow and labor, serving others, never shirking toil or hardship, never avoiding high or low, elder or younger, but offering all for wealth. Those who study the Dao should be likewise: in seeking the Dharma and serving a teacher, do not discriminate by status, nor speak of seniority. Do not say, "I am older, while they are young," or "They are of low birth, while I am a lofty scholar." Those who harbor such thoughts still cling to the attitudes of life and death in the mundane world and do not comprehend the essentials of the perfect and equal truth. Such people study the Dao in vain, hoping for merit in vain!

There is no high or low among people; where there is the Dao, there is honor. The so-called elder need not be one of advanced years; what matters is broad knowledge and deep insight. One should not say, "Their studies came after mine, while mine came first—how can I now reverse and take them as my teacher?" Those who think thus belong to the company of the foolish and envious; they are not my disciples.

The Dao demands humility and deference, yielding to ability and deferring to virtue. Follow only what is good; do not exalt yourself and belittle others, nor insist on your own rightness while condemning others. This is a grave illness in the study of the Dao.

You must teach future generations to be cautious—cautious indeed!

The Most High said: Though disciples may receive many teachings, they should still revere their original teacher; the original teacher should also humble themselves before their disciples. The reason is this: in attaining the Dao and delivering the world, none do so without learning from a teacher. Having a teacher is like a tree having roots—because of the roots, the branches flourish and spread. Those who study the Dao likewise take their original teacher as their foundation, gradually perfecting great wisdom. Once great wisdom is perfected, it can in turn perfect lesser wisdom, just as a tree produces seeds from its roots, and the seeds in turn produce roots, extending and multiplying without end. From the teacher, one receives the Dao, gradually increasing and accumulating virtue. When one’s virtue surpasses that of the teacher, one may then teach the teacher. This is what is meant by "the Dao is noble, the person is base"—the principle is thus.

Lord Daoling said: If, as you teach, the original teacher should also defer to the disciple, then what of the rites, rules, and forms for receiving the Dao? How should one show respect to earlier and later teachers?

The Most High said: Both earlier and later teachers deserve respect. The reason is this: the original teacher is the root of one’s learning. It is like building a mountain—it begins with a single basket of earth, gradually achieving height and grandeur. The original teacher is likewise the foundation for one’s initial awakening. The later teacher brings completion. It is like fine attire and adornments—all things are prepared, yet without the final crowning, one cannot go forth to engage in human affairs. The later teacher is likewise thus. Though one may study the Dao for a long time, if the superior methods are not complete, one cannot attain the Dao.

From the *Scripture of Ascending Mystery*

Master Yin said: From the time my hair was still bound in youth, I loved the Dao and virtue. I left my home and followed my teacher east and west, north and south, abandoning the Five Classics, secluding myself from the world for over twenty years beside famous mountains. In cold, I had no time for clothing; in hunger, no time for food. I dared not think of returning home, dared not rest from my labors. I served my sagely teacher, awaiting their pleasure, my face dirty, my hands calloused, until at last I was recognized.

From the *Scripture of Daoist Traces*

The good are the teachers of the not-good; the not-good are the resource for the good.

One who does not value their teacher nor cherish their resource—though they may possess knowledge, they remain deluded. This is called the essential mystery.

From the *Daoist Scripture of Laozi*

Laozi said: Without a luminous teacher, how can one resolve doubts and difficulties?
My Dao is like a single hair—who can truly discern its divisions?
From the beginning of past ages, all that has transpired is like dust and sand.
Each movement entails kalpas of effort; I reflect and find it arduous indeed.

From the *Scripture of Western Ascension*

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One said: The teacher is a treasure.
To study the Dao without a teacher is to fail; without a teacher, there is no deliverance; without a teacher, there is no transcendence.
Thus, the teacher is my father.
If a disciple does not revere the teacher’s Dao, they cannot subdue demons, will ruin their own body, and how then may they ride the Eight Radiant Dragon Chariot or ascend the Jade Terrace of the Great Ultimate?
You now study the Dao of Highest Clarity, aspiring to ascend and soar, to eternally enjoy boundless fortune. Yet if you slight your teacher and practice the Dao, seeking the flight of flesh, it is like casting a night-shining pearl away—you will lose your one true path.

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One, Yu Luoqiao, addressed the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, saying: You have accumulated kalpas of thought and action, mortifying the body to save beings, delivering all that lives, extending kindness even to grasses and trees. You entrusted yourself to forests and hills, restrained your passions, endured hardship, revered your teacher and lineage, labored without weariness, cultivated a resolute and earnest will—thus attaining utmost virtue. You have ascended to the Purple Orchid Terrace and the Golden Towers of the Highest Clarity Palace, where jade texts with purple characters record your towering merit. Your conduct aligns with that of the highest immortals. The Most High has commanded the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate to be your Master of the Three Caverns. Now, I am further commanded to serve as your First Initiating Teacher. You may resume your seat, and I shall instruct you in the turning of the Dharma Wheel, the essential admonitions, and the decisive precepts.

The Second Perfected One of the Most High Mysterious Unity, Guang Miaoyin, addressed the Left Immortal Duke, saying: You have revolved through the cycles of birth and death, forming karmic bonds with the good. Through kalpas, you have accumulated merit, lifetime after lifetime, never ceasing. You abandoned glory and renounced rank, entrusting yourself to secluded hills. In hunger and cold, on perilous paths, you thought of the Dao without complaint. You revered the teacher’s treasure as if facing a deity, your heart gentle and yielding, ever joyful in sitting and rising. You maintained long fasts and diligent contemplation, never neglecting the proper times. Your concentrated sincerity has penetrated deeply—thus you are named among the elect of Highest Clarity. The Most High has commanded me to be your Second Initiating Teacher. I shall fully instruct you in the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, the roots of birth and death, and the essential admonitions.

The Third Perfected One of the Most High Mysterious Unity, Zhen Dingguang, addressed the Left Immortal Duke, saying: For seven generations, you have been benevolent, cutting your own flesh to save the destitute, extending kindness even to birds and beasts, moistening your own body with generosity. You have also accumulated diligent service to your teacher’s treasure, thinking not of furs in the cold nor of taste in hunger. Amid hardships in mountain forests, your devotion has never wavered. The Purple Treasury has received your true nature, and a wondrous light has arisen from your neck, drawing the descent of the exalted. You have been granted the rank of Immortal Minister to repay your past virtue—how majestic indeed! The Most High has commanded me to be your Third Initiating Teacher. Now, I shall instruct you in the boundless wondrous penetrations, the turning of the spirit, and the essential precepts of meditative absorption.

From the *Scripture of the Wheel of Mysterious Caverns*

If scriptures are not received from a teacher, the spirit does not move. Should the world lack a Dharma Master and no register be transmitted, one may offer a pledge of faith to the Pure and Cold [realm], or in a secluded chamber invoke the Mysterious Teacher. Facing north, bow three times, then spread offerings upon the ground to relieve the hungry and destitute. With equanimity and single-mindedness, proceed thus. If a teacher exists in the world, this method need not be employed.

From the *Hidden Commentary on the Mysterious Caverns*

From the *Divine Immortals Section of the Jade Register of the Middle Prime*:
Reverence for the teacher’s demeanor begins with the Scripture Master—thus rites should be observed.
The ancestral lineage of the Three Clarities begins with the Register Master—thus rites should be observed.
The records of life and death, the means of deliverance, begin with the Deliverance Master—the teacher who transmits scriptures and delivers one from the five paths of difficulty—thus rites should be observed.
In learning, if one does not honor the Three Teachers, the Three Treasures will not descend, the Three Realms will not show respect, and demonic forces will harm the body.

From the *Divine Immortals Section of the Yellow Register of the Lower Prime*:
The ritual of merit and demeanor in serving the teacher: When the Scripture Master initiates disciples, the three who receive the Dharma Master are immediately enrolled among the meritorious in the heavens. Once merit and name are established, they may traverse the Three Realms, and the Five Emperors become their guests.

From the *Divine Immortals Section of the Yellow Register*:
The ritual of merit and demeanor in serving the teacher: When the Register Master initiates disciples, the seven who receive the Dharma Master are immediately enrolled among the meritorious in the heavens. Their names are recorded in the immortal registers, their seven generations of ancestors ascend, and they advance to the celestial halls.

From the *Divine Immortals Section of the Yellow Register*:
The ritual of merit and demeanor in serving the teacher: When the Deliverance Master initiates disciples, the nine who receive the Dharma Master are immediately enrolled among the meritorious in the heavens. Their names are inscribed on white tablets, and their great merit ensures that nine generations of ancestors ascend together, all attaining freedom in the Seven Jeweled Forests.

From the *Divine Immortals Section of the Yellow Register*:
When initiating disciples under the Three Teachers: If the Scripture Master has already ascended, the Register Master should also be initiated. If the Register Master has ascended, the Deliverance Master should also be initiated. According to the regulations, merit and name are reported to the heavens. If all Three Teachers have ascended, three disciples should be initiated and entrusted to virtuous fellow students. The fellow students must follow the regulations, reporting merit and name to the heavens without omission.

From the *Golden Register of the Mysterious Caverns*

From the *Central Scripture of the Most High*:
The teacher is so called because of the scriptural practice they embody; the recipient studies it, aligning in sincerity. Their joys and sorrows are intertwined, their bond equal to life and death. Only then can they be tested and proven, together ascending the immortal courts. Thus, facing east, one bows and receives instruction, pledging in the secluded chamber. Superior and inferior are made manifest, the three covenants distinguished. With diligent heart, one treasures the scriptural storehouse, practicing its essential words. Sincerity is maintained with single-mindedness; reverence for teacher and scripture is preserved in the heart’s core, never faltering.
Only thus may one speak of communion with the divine and the covenant of Dao and virtue.
To uphold the scriptures while concealing their Dao, to act in accordance with their vows—then above, one’s name is inscribed on the jade tablets, recorded in the imperial registers of the Great Ultimate.

From the *Esoteric Writings of the Great Cinnabar* (*Dongzhen Taidan Yinshu Jing*), "Faith and Pledges" Chapter:

The Flying Heavenly Divine Persons declare: To receive the ten sections of the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, cast three golden dragons into the watery abodes and sacred mountain dwellings, uniting these three places as the pledge of immortal study.

It is further said: Prepare silk banners of five colors, each forty feet in length, to invoke the Five Thearchs as the pledge of sworn testimony.

It is further said: Use five ounces of finest gold to covenant with the Five Marchmounts as the pledge of the precious scriptures.

It is further said: Employ twenty-four thousand gold coins as surety for the twenty-four life-officials, the pledge of revering the true. If gold is lacking, bronze may suffice.

It is further said: The celestial writings are secret and weighty; without faith, they are not treasured. Thus, the perfected sages test the heart through pledges. Without faith, one is deemed base in the Way; without covenant, the treasure is treated lightly.

It is further said: If one receives the scriptures while pledges remain incomplete, and later encounters a worthy person who brings the required pledges to request transmission, one should fulfill the missing pledges with what has been received. Any surplus from the former master’s vestments may be used for one’s own ritual purposes.

It is further said: Of the pledges for receiving the scriptures, one-fifth is to be offered to the ancestral master. Another two-fifths are to be dispersed to the destitute and mountain-dwelling Daoists. The remaining pledges are to be used for one’s own ritual needs—burning incense, lighting lamps—to establish merit for the disciple.

It is further said: When the Heavenly Kings and Thearchs dispel calamities and deliver from peril, use five-colored patterned silk, its length matching the number of zhang, and dragons made of finest gold. For imperial decrees, employ purple-patterned silk; for commoners, plain silk. Dragons are to be made of standard gold. The rites of lamp-lighting and supplication follow the same method as above.

From the *Scriptures of Clarity and Illumination* (*Dongxuan Mingzhen Jing*):

The Heavenly Worthy asks: Why does the Great Dao so demand wealth and treasures from people, compelling them to perform meritorious works? It observes their miserly hearts and tests their intentions. If one possesses yet does not disperse, what can they seek? Those who, though impoverished, rouse their resolve with steadfast clarity, toiling diligently at the master’s gate without fear of hardship—such ones are witnessed by the Dao. Their merit moves the various heavens. Thus, offering wealth corresponds to the heart, and extending the heart corresponds to wealth; their merit is equal.

The ancients sought the heart; the latter age seeks wealth. The ancients attained immortality only through the heart; the latter age achieves deliverance only through wealth. This is so because in the latter age, wealth is prized while the Dao is not. If one were to offer ten thousand pounds of gold and a single scripture of immortality in a barren mountain, the people of the latter age would covet the gold, not the scripture. Gold can only bring bodily affliction, while the scripture can secure long life. Though all know this, they cannot escape their own stinginess and greed. If they cannot escape stinginess and greed, how can they be called followers of the Dao? Thus, it is not the Dao that exalts people—this is what is meant.

---

From the *Scriptures of the Three Primal Realms’ Admonitions* (*Dongxuan Sanyuan Pinjie Jing*):

The Most High declares: Pledges are to be used for purificatory fasts, offering incense and oil to the scriptures and the Dao, creating fields of blessing for all, and dispersing alms to mountain-dwelling Daoists, the destitute, and those afflicted by the six miseries of the world. The Dharma Master must not privately use them; the transgression is grave. Those who mislead others in the study of the Dao—students of the Dao, beware! Beware!

---

From the *Scriptures of Natural Illumination* (*Dongxuan Ziran Jing*):

The Heavenly Worthy addresses the Left Mystic Perfected: When you transmit these scriptures, you must follow the pledges of the hidden canons, using gold, coins, patterned silk, and other items all in accordance with the prescribed forms.

This method originates from the profound contemplation of the Primordial Sovereign of Vast Emptiness and Pristine Simplicity. It is constantly treasured and practiced by the Primal Elders of the Five Directions.

The recipient provides five parts of finest gold and five ounces of undyed silk to honor the spirits of the Five Directions’ Primal Elders. The silk banner corresponds to one’s destined lifespan of one hundred twenty years. For each year beyond, one *gong* of silk is added for a prince, one *zhang* for a commoner, and one *chi* for the poor. These three types of offerings must not be omitted; to receive the transmission while lacking them is to incur transgression. Adjustments may be made according to wealth or poverty.

---

From the *Scriptures of Subtle Contemplation and Resolute Will* (*Dongxuan Siwei Dingzhi Jing*):

The Perfected One states: The transmission protocols for the *Five Thousand Character Scripture* are identical to those of the *Numinous Treasure*, reserved exclusively for those of exceptional talent and resolve who diligently recite and seek the Dao of spontaneous ascent to immortality. The recipient must present fifty *chi* of undyed silk as ritual offering to the *Numinous Treasure*, receiving both scriptures simultaneously atop a renowned mountain peak.

The Immortal Duke says: Those of lofty virtue in the world who wish to recite and aspire to ascend as immortals should receive it alongside the *Numinous Treasure*.

—From the *Scriptures of Ritual Offerings in the Cavernous Mystery* (*Dongxuan Fuzhai Jing*)

The Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity Heaven addressed the Supreme Minister, the Azure Lad, and the Lord of the Western City: Those whose hearts delight in the Dao, who joyfully and diligently focus on the profound, who do not begrudge wealth and treasure, and who esteem the Dao above all else—only to such persons may one speak of it. Those who inwardly covet riches and outwardly harbor frivolous desires are barred from the Dao, which seals itself away like jade tablets locked behind golden gates. After their ascension and deliverance, the scriptures are concealed within sacred mountains.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Supreme Numinous Tiger* (*Dongzhen Taishang Shenhu Yujing*)

For the transmission of true names and concealed arts, in accordance with the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, one must provide eight taels of purple gold and eighty *chi* of cinnabar-patterned brocade.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Eight Hidden Arts of the Cinnabar Radiance Dao* (*Dongzhen Danjing Daojing Yindi Bashu Jing*)

Whenever a master receives ritual offerings for an alliance, they must distribute them to the destitute and impoverished, relieve the urgent distress of the sick and poor, succor the starving in mountains and rivers, and fund the public works of the divine spirits. If one privately appropriates them for personal sustenance or greedily hoards them for profit, then the master’s seven generations of ancestors will suffer prolonged torment in hell, and their own body will enter the Wind and Blade Hell.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Lofty and Sagely Golden Mystery* (*Dongzhen Gaosheng Jinxuan Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Real Scripture*, the *Eightfold Jade Register of the Eight Winds’ Meandering Path of the Emperor Unity* of the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the *Mysterious Reversion of the Great Cinnabar and the Five Penetrations of the Twelve Supreme Vows*, the *Ninefold Array of the Mysterious Mother’s Prior Entry into the Golden Flower Chamber of the Feminine Unity*, and the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text’s Ninefold Mysteries*, which fills the five viscera with *langgan* and radiant cinnabar, one must first sever the binding cord to proceed. The regulations are as follows:

Fashion a ring from purple gold, one *cun* in diameter, and cut it in half. Master and disciple shall each wear one half for life. Use a blue silk cord, nine *chi* in length, and sever it in half, wrapping each half around their respective ring halves before wearing them. Prepare a piece of blue brocade, one *chi* and eight *cun* in size, and divide it in half to make pouches to hold the gold rings and blue silk cords. Once the rings are divided, the disciple bows three times to receive the scripture.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Great Cavern* (*Dongzhen Dadong Zhenjing*)

For the transmission of the *Ninefold Luminous Statutes of the Supreme Plain and Numinous Great Possession’s Jade Chapters*, in accordance with the statutes, the recipient must provide three taels of fine gold, one hundred *chi* of purple silk, twenty-seven *chi* of blue silk, five taels of red thread, one *jin* of aloeswood, and one tael of cinnabar, presenting them to the master as tokens of the alliance.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Jade Formulae of the Inner Deities of the Four Palaces* (*Dongzhen Sigong Neishen Baoming Yujue Jing*)

Five colors of brocade, fifty *chi* each, are used to petition the immortal officials of the Five Emperors. Five taels of purple gold serve as pledges to the oaths of the Five Directions. Five *jin* of aloeswood ascend as offerings to the Three Primordial Palaces. One *jin* of true pearls serves as the token of the cinnabar alliance. One inscribed knife severs the path of deathly *qi*. Seven gold pearls are used to summon the essences of the Seven Primes. Seventy *chi* of crimson silk serve as the pledge of the Flaming Radiance.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Purple Transcendence and Flaming Radiance’s Divine Mystery* (*Dongzhen Zidu Yanguang Shenxuan Bianjing*)

For the transmission of the *Hidden Writings of the Great Perfected of the Mysterious Mound*, one must provide forty *chi* of white silk, ten *chi* of blue silk, three pairs of gold rings, and nine taels of incense. The white silk substitutes for the blood oath of plain silk; the blue silk serves as the pledge for the three transmissions over seven hundred years; the gold rings signify the unbreakable vow of secrecy; and the incense serves as the luminous alliance with the spirits.

For the transmission of the *Formulae of the Plain Silk Oral Instructions*, one must use forty *chi* of cinnabar-dyed silk and two pairs of gold buttons as tokens of the *True One of the Imperial Mystery*.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Plain Silk Oral Instructions* (*Dongzhen Qusu Jueci Jing*)

For the transmission of writings inscribed in cinnabar on purple silk, the disciple must present seven taels of fine gold, forty *chi* of yellow silk, and thirty-two *chi* of blue silk, swearing an oath before transmission.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence* (*Dongzhen Huangqi Yangjing Jing*)

For the transmission of the talismans for summoning spirits, attracting the perfected, capturing demons, and the *Seven Primes of the Vast and Open*, in accordance with the luminous statutes, the disciple must present one *jade dragon* and one *golden fish*, one hundred *chi* of purple silk, and three taels of fine gold to the master possessing the scripture, swearing an oath to the Nine Heavens.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance’s Eightfold Ascent* (*Dongzhen Jinzhen Yuguang Bajing Feijing*)

In ancient times, oaths were sworn by tasting blood and cutting hair, erecting altars to inform Heaven, as unbreakable pledges of secrecy. Nowadays, one may substitute offerings of gold and silk for the body’s flesh and hair, arranging them in a secluded place to invoke the Supreme August One. The ritual requires three gold rings, bright and lustrous, and thirty-nine *chi* of blue silk to replace the threefold covenant. Alternatively, they may be joined into twenty-seven *chi*. The ritual offerings must be recorded in full and may not be privately used for personal gain.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Hidden Writings of the Great Cinnabar* (*Dongzhen Taidan Yinshu Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Writings of the Seven Sages’ Mysterious Record, the Nine Heavens’ Reversion, the White Tablets of the Plain Register*, the disciple must present seven taels of fine gold, seventy-two *chi* of purple silk, and seven taels of superior cinnabar, approaching the master facing north to receive the transmission after swearing an oath to the Lofty and Sagely Heaven.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Seven Sages’ Mysterious Record* (*Dongzhen Qisheng Xuanji Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Nine Perfected Mysterious Scriptures*, one must first taste blood and ascend the altar in layers, cutting hair to swear an unbreakable oath of secrecy. Later sages, deeming blood-tasting injurious to the vital *qi* and hair-cutting a violation of the body’s integrity, now substitute yellow gold for the blood oath and thirty-two *chi* of soft blue silk for the hair-cutting pledge. The master must not disperse the oath offerings for private gain or misuse them; they must be bestowed upon mountain-dwelling recluses, solitary practitioners, and impoverished Daoists.

—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Supreme Ascent on Feathered Wings* (*Dongzhen Taishang Feixing Yujing*)

For the transmission of the *Scripture of the Great Mystery*, the disciple must present three *liang* of finest gold, one hundred *chi* of purple silk, twenty-seven *chi* of blue damask, five *liang* of red thread, one *jin* of aloeswood, and one *liang* of cinnabar, then approach the master to receive the text.

For the transmission of the *Scripture of the Central Record of Embryonic Essence*, the disciple must present one *jin* of finest gold, eighty *chi* of white silk, and one *jin* of cinnabar to substitute for the oath sworn facing north, pledging in solemn covenant, and may not transmit it lightly or without faith.

In ancient times, ninety *chi* of dark numinous brocade, forty *chi* of gold-slip phoenix-patterned gauze, and nine pairs of gold buttons were used to substitute for the hair-cutting and blood-tasting oath of non-disclosure. These items are marvelous fabrics from the divine realm, not found in the mundane world. Now, brocade may be substituted with white silk, gauze with blue cloth, and buttons with gold rings, which are sufficient to pledge faith to the Nine Heavens, regulate and report to the Three Officials, and all are to be offered to the master possessing the scripture.
—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* (*Dongzhen Huangting Neijing Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Scripture of the Foreign Release of Karma*, the disciple must present nine *liang* of finest gold and thirty-six *chi* of *ba*-patterned damask as a pledge.
—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Foreign Release of Karma* (*Dongzhen Waiguo Fangpin Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Purple Writ*, the disciple must follow the regulations of the Nine Perfected Mysterious Code, cultivate according to the methods and standards, and present one gold fish and one jade dragon as pledges in accordance with the covenant, along with one hundred *chi* of purple damask and forty *chi* of blue silk, then approach the master possessing the scripture to receive it.
—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Azure Essentials and Purple Writ* (*Dongzhen Qingyao Zishu Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Golden Writ*, the disciple must present two *liang* of finest gold, forty *chi* of blue silk, and ninety *chi* of white gauze, then pledge in covenant before transmission.
—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Jade Pendant Golden Bell Supreme Ultimate Golden Writ* (*Dongzhen Yupai Jinchang Taiji Jinshu Shangjing*)

For the transmission of the *Supreme Yellow Plain Scripture of the Forty-Four Directions*, the covenant requires one jade tablet, one *chi* and five *fen* in length and one *cun* and four *fen* in width, to pledge to the Four Poles of the Supreme Perfected. Additionally, forty *chi* of yellow plain silk and two pairs of gold rings are used to substitute for the blood-tasting oath of non-disclosure.
—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Yellow Plain Forty-Four Directions* (*Dongzhen Huangsu Sishisi Fang Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Seven Stars’ Transfer of Degrees*, the disciple must present thirty-one *chi* of blue silk, seventy *chi* of red damask, ninety *chi* of phoenix-patterned gauze, seven pairs of gold buttons, and one pair each of gold fish and jade dragons as pledges for the covenant.
—From the *Cavern-Real Scripture of the Celestial Pass Three Diagrams and Seven Stars’ Transfer of Degrees* (*Dongzhen Tianguan Santu Qixing Yidu Jing*)

For the transmission of the *Numinous Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, the recipient must present nine *liang* of finest gold and ninety *chi* of purple silk to pledge faith to the Nine Heavens, after which the master will then pledge and transmit.
—From the *Cavern-Real Numinous Writ of the Grand Empyrean* (*Dongzhen Taixiao Langshu*)

**Section on Transmission of Degrees**
When transmitting scriptures, the master possessing the text must first seek a spiritual response before proceeding. They should enter the chamber, burn incense, and secretly vow to the divine spirits, then bow before the scripture and silently pray:
*"Supreme Primordial Sovereign, Great Divinity of the Immortal Capital, on this auspicious day, I humbly present eight wishes. Desiring to transmit this supreme method, I dare to report to the Numinous Origin—may I know if it is permissible?"*
After the prayer, they should retire to rest and will surely receive a divine response. The disciple will then know in their heart whether it is favorable or not and may proceed with transmission only after careful consideration.

The method for the master transmitting scriptures is as follows: First, bow to the four directions to invoke the divine spirits as the principal masters, then slowly take up the scripture, stand, and raise it toward the heavens to pray, reporting and pledging to the divine spirits as a covenant of the mysterious code. They must state the name of the disciple receiving the scripture and report to the great divinities the title of the scripture being transmitted, establishing its regulations and inscribing them in records, adorning the text with elegant phrases to present it. After the prayer, the disciple should bow twice and kneel to receive it.

Upon receiving the scripture, the disciple should bow twice again.

This is the inner method of the covenant between the Perfected and the gods—it need not be preserved in full, nor require blood-oaths or daring leaks of its pacts. Whenever a master transmits scriptures, they must first purify themselves through fasting and seclusion, avoiding all worldly affairs. They should first invoke the divine spirits, seeking secret resonance, and only then proceed with transmission. If the signs appear disordered or the omens inauspicious, this is the celestial spirits manifesting their judgment, forbidding the transmission. Should a disciple disregard the divine spirits and transmit to two individuals, according to the statutes of the *Yellow and Plain Registers*, the disciple will face dark retribution, their seven generations of ancestors confined to hell for eternity, and their own body doomed to perish—how then could immortality be hoped for?

**From the *Dongzhen Huangsu Sishisi Fang Jing***

The Most High said: Dao-ling, know that those worthy of receiving this scripture possess ten traits:
1. They seek superior methods and follow goodness as water flows downstream.
2. They draw near to the wise and virtuous, free from doubt in their conduct.
3. They are discerning, able to distinguish truth from falsehood.
4. They are cautious, their words never exceeding their deeds.
5. They are gentle and mild, seldom committing transgressions.
6. They can serve as disciples to those superior to themselves, without arrogance.
7. They revere their masters and treasure their teachings as a pauper treasures treasure.
8. They can serve their masters and elders without shirking toil.
9. They harbor no resentment toward former masters.
10. They earnestly request instruction, persisting day and night without slackening—these are the ten traits.

Ziming addressed the Most High, saying: If in future ages there are Daoist scholars who have not yet encountered true scriptures, and suddenly discover this text in mountain caves or among heterodox practitioners, foreign masters, or those of deviant views, and upon reading it from beginning to end recognize its authenticity and essential teachings—yet find no master to transmit it—may they practice and transmit it?

The Most High said: They may practice it themselves and cultivate it as the scripture instructs, but they may not transmit it to others. Why? Learning requires a master’s transmission. Without a master’s transmission, what foundation is there? First, it risks misleading later students; second, without a master’s transmission, others may not believe it, and if disbelief arises, slander may follow—thus, it may not be transmitted. One must seek a master to receive and transmit it. If, after searching the four seas, no master can be found, one may seclude themselves in a quiet chamber, make vows, and cultivate in earnest. If they encounter a person of utmost sincerity who possesses the ten traits above, earnestly seeking instruction with unwavering resolve, and first presents a token of faith—testing their resolve without wavering, their heart growing ever more steadfast—then transmission may be granted. If within the four seas a master can be found where human traces reach, one must obtain a master and not transmit recklessly.

Ziming further inquired: If in the latter ages there are Daoist scholars who have already received the outer teachings of the *Lingbao* registers and covenants, practicing the Five Chapters, but have not yet encountered this inner teaching—may they receive and practice it upon later encountering it?

The Most High replied: They must first receive the covenant of the *Seventy-Two Character Register of the Plain and Yellow* and the *Supreme Register*, and only then may the scripture be transmitted. Why? The registers and covenants of the two teachings do not encompass the ten directions, nor do the great invocations of the Most High. Thus, the officials, spirits, gods, earth deities, dragons, and ghosts of the ten directions will not come to protect and empower the covenant of the scripture.

**From the *Shengxuan Neijiao Jing***
*Concluding the Thirty-Fourth Scroll of the* Wushang Miyao

**From the *Wushang Miyao*
*Thirty-Fifth Scroll: Rites of Transmission, Purificatory Fast, and Petition for Initiation***

First, one must bathe and purify, bearing incense and offerings. Proceeding to the master, bow thrice, kowtow, and kneel upright to receive the petition.

**Text of the Petition:**

**Petition:**
On this day, the radiant flow of time has already slipped away. Ever fearful that this subtle *qi* may suddenly sink into that darkness—darkness without dawn, an endless night from which escape is hard.

The lonely and suffering soul, distressed and weary, seeks refuge yet finds none. Prostrate, I have heard that the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, has expounded teachings—if receiving the Ten Precepts, state: *The Ten Precepts and Fourteen Articles for Upholding the Body*. If receiving the *Five Thousand Character Writ*, state: *The Five Thousand Character Scripture of Dao and Virtue*. If receiving the *Three Sovereigns*, state: *The Cavern Spirit’s Three Sovereigns’ Talismanic Charts and Jade Scripts*. If receiving the *True Writ*, state: *The Numinous Treasure’s True Writ, Talismanic Charts, and Jade Scripts*. If receiving *Highest Clarity*, state: *The Cavern Perfection’s Highest Clarity Talismanic Charts and Jade Scripts*. If the five ranks receive transmission together, summarize the preceding five methods, stating: *The texts are concise, the matters essential—nothing, however minute, is left untransmitted*. Mortals, being dull, must devote themselves wholeheartedly to the rare opportunity of reception. Should one receive the teachings at dawn and perish by dusk, there shall be no regret or resentment. Thus, I exhaust all sincerity, preparing the offering as prescribed. Bowing my head in reverence, I present this petition for your hearing, humbly beseeching fulfillment. Respectfully submitted on the [day] of the [month] in the year of [Tai Sui] [Celestial Stem-Branch].

**Next: Entering the Dao-Field and Secret Invocation Method:**
To the Four Superior Merit-Officials, Dragon-Tiger Envoys, Orthodox Unity’s *Qi*-Generating Attendant, the Serene and Unadorned Maiden—if there is a matter to report at night, I request the Luminous Youth and the Supreme Mystery Maiden to accompany me into the Yellow Chamber, that my words may be conveyed and heard above.

**Source:** *The Scripture of the Golden Register*

**Next: The Method of Silent Reflection on the Three Masters**

First, reflect upon the direction where the Scripture Master resides, bowing in the heart three times, praying that the Master attain the Dao of immortality and elevate my person to transcendence. Next, reflect upon the direction where the Register Master resides, bowing in the heart three times, praying that the Master attain the flight of immortality, opening the path for my seven generations of ancestors and parents to ascend early to the Heavenly Hall, that I may obtain the True Dao and ascend into the Formless. Then, reflect upon the direction where the Initiation Master resides, bowing in the heart three times, praying that the Master ascend to the highest immortality, opening the path for me through the Five Realms and Eight Difficulties, that my name be inscribed in the Register of Immortals, and I forever become a Perfected Person.

**Source:** *The Jade Register Scripture*

**Next: The Method of Activating the Incense Burner:**
To the Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Origin, the Three *Qi* of the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth the Three and Five Merit-Officials within the body of so-and-so, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Bearers of Incense, the Courier Dragon Riders, the Golden Youth Attending Incense, the Jade Maiden Attending Incense, and the True Talismans of the Five Emperors—thirty-six of each—commanding them to exit the passes and inform the local earth gods and true officials of this realm. I now burn incense and present this nocturnal petition, praying that the *qi* of the Most High’s Ten Directions and Orthodox Perfected may enter my body, that my words swiftly ascend before the August Person of the Supreme Ultimate Great Dao, the Jade Sovereign of the Limitless Heaven.

**Source:** *The Ordinances of Illuminating Perfection*

**Next: The Method of Presenting Petitions:**
The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Most High Three Caverns Disciple, so-and-so, Master of the Sacred Peak, and others, reverently address the Most High Three Treasures and the Perfected of the Ten Directions. By karmic affinity of past lives, we were born under the transformation of the Mysterious Perfected, delivered and rooted in faith. Our former masters transmitted the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures through covenants, and we have served, revered, and cultivated the fasts and retreats. Yet from the day we received the Dharma, we must exhaust our humble capacities to propagate its teachings, guiding all beings so that those who have not heard may hear, and those who have not seen may see. May the wind of the Primordial Beginning spread through the Ten Directions, and the compassionate grace of the Most High universally moisten the hidden and manifest. For all who turn toward this path, we dare not fail to report above. Respectfully spoken.

We, the humble disciples, now present our earnest and fervent plea, bearing our sincerest devotion to seek and receive the precepts. Should we receive the Ten Precepts, we shall uphold the fourteen virtues of bodily discipline. Should we receive the Five Thousand Characters, we shall reverently study the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue in Five Thousand Words*. Should we receive the Three Sovereigns, we shall treasure the *Jade Scripts, Talismans, and Charts of the Cavernous Divine Three Sovereigns*. Should we receive the True Writs, we shall honor the *Jade Scripts, Talismans, and Charts of the Numinous Treasure True Writs*. Should we receive the Supreme Clarity, we shall venerate the *Jade Scripts, Talismans, and Charts of the Cavernous Perfection Supreme Clarity*. If all five ranks are received together in this assembly, we shall collectively record the preceding five Dharma teachings, preserving them forever as the treasures of our bodies. We shall diligently follow the Dharma, maintaining purity, burning incense, and performing the Dao-circuits. Beginning at dawn tomorrow, we shall adhere to the ancient codes of dignity, fulfill our roles and duties, and proclaim the regulations and prohibitions, so that all learners may submit to the Dharma teachings.

We humbly beseech the Most High Venerables, the Three Treasures’ majestic deities, the Great Dharma Masters who oversee the fasts, and the attendant Perfected of the scriptures to deign to witness and examine our words. May they bestow their favor upon the officials of the Three Realms, the local earth gods and territorial deities who guard this place, and upon us, the disciples, so that our dwellings may be purified, malevolent impurities dispelled, and our every aspiration met with response. We shall, at dawn tomorrow, perform the Dao-circuits according to the Dharma and report further.

Next, the Three Hymns of Wisdom:

**First Hymn:**
Wisdom arises from the formless,
Radiant and boundless, transcending the Ten Directions.
It structures emptiness, towering in the Mysterious Empyrean,
While all heavens draw from its flowing fragrance.
Its wonder defies thought,
Yet through emptiness, true and real communion is achieved.
What seems to exist ultimately does not,
And what seems not to exist holds all within.

**Second Hymn:**
Wisdom constantly observes the body,
Foremost in the study of the Dao.
Subtly it enters the Mysterious Workshop,
Naturally recording my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever shields and protects,
While demon kings pledge their guardianship.
Resplendent is the Vajra body,
Transcendent, a Supreme Clarity Immortal.

**Third Hymn:**
Wisdom engenders the root of precepts,
For the true Dao, precepts are the foundation.
From them arise the Three Treasures,
Revered and received by lofty immortals.
Riding this deathless vessel,
Swiftly it ferries the multitudes.
When the time comes to expound the precepts,
All heavens bow their heads in homage.

Next, the Homage to All Heavenly Worthies:

With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Dawn in the North.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Ascended Immortals and Supreme Saints in the Northeast.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Sovereign in the East.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Life-Nurturing and Destiny-Deliverance in the Southeast.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Perfection and Myriad Blessings in the South.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous and Void Sovereign in the Southwest.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Wonder and Utmost Limit in the West.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Florescence in the Northwest.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void and Luminous Sovereign in the Upper Realm.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Cavernous Divine in the Lower Realm.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Lofty Jade Sovereign of the Past.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Beginning of the Present.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Ultimate of the Future.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital and Mysterious Terrace.
With utmost sincerity, we pay homage to all the Perfected, Immortals, and Attained Holy Multitudes.

The master then faces west, sits upright, and expounds the precepts, while all disciples prostrate themselves to receive them.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: "Now I shall universally proclaim and propagate the Dharma’s resonance, awakening all beings. For men and women alike, I shall dissolve calamities, avert misfortunes, invoke blessings, deliver destinies, and eradicate the roots of suffering. May the living perceive the Dao and escape the Eight Difficulties; may the dead rejoice, feast in the heavens, and swiftly be reborn among humans as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings. All who perform fasts and seek the Dao must single-mindedly request and receive the Ten Precepts, earnestly upholding them without forgetfulness. Focus your minds, contemplate in silence, and reflect upon the natural order. Do not allow stray thoughts to disturb your forms and spirits. Those who can do so shall now listen attentively:

**First Precept:** Let the heart harbor no malice or jealousy. Do not cultivate hidden harm. Guard your speech, be cautious of transgressions, and let your thoughts dwell in the Dharma.

**Second Precept:** Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing. Pity and aid all beings, extending compassionate salvation to all.

**Third Precept:** Maintain chastity and yield to righteousness. Do not indulge in lust or theft. Constantly cultivate good thoughts, diminishing the self to aid others.

**Fourth Precept:** Be free from sensuality and desire. Let the heart not wander. Uphold purity and caution, ensuring your conduct remains unstained.

**Fifth Precept:** Let your speech be free of malice. Do not adorn your words with florid embellishment. Be loyal and upright within and without, avoiding verbal transgressions.

**Sixth Precept:** Abstain from alcohol and regulate your conduct. Harmonize your qi and nature, preserving your spirit from harm and avoiding all evils.

**Seventh Precept:** Do not envy those who surpass you or contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and retreat, humbling yourself to deliver others.

**Eighth Precept:** Do not criticize or disparage the scriptures and teachings. Personally uphold the Dharma, ever reverent as if in the presence of the divine.

**Ninth Precept:** Do not incite discord or engage in slander among the four classes of beings and heavenly folk. Such faults harm and deplete the spirit and qi.

**Tenth Precept:** In all actions and deeds, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people, and tranquility among spirits, ever thus in your conduct."

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "When establishing fasts and performing Dao-circuits, the Four Heavenly Kings arrive in flying green-wheel clouds and eight-scene jade chariots. Perfected beings and jade maidens hold floral banners, leading with phoenix songs, followed by celestial harmonies. White cranes and lions chant poems in unison. Incense is burned, flowers scattered, drifting through the void as they come to witness the Dao-circuits and listen to the Dharma’s resonance. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage. How could one not fully devote oneself to this Dharma?"

First receive the Ten Precepts, then perform the Dao-circuits. Proceed with refined steps and graceful bearing, calm the mind and close the thoughts. In sitting, rising, lying, or resting, never depart from proper form. Thus the Heavenly Kings rejoice, and the ranks of the Upper Clarity ascend—this may be called attaining the Dao within the square inch of the heart.

*—From the Scripture of Great Precepts*

The above is excerpted from the *Scripture on the Arrangement of the Fast*.

Next, having proclaimed the regulations, each makes two bows to the master.

Next, the master faces east, kneels, and invokes the Perfected Officials.

The Supreme, Numinous Treasure, Unsurpassed Three Caverns disciples of such-and-such a mountain, so-and-so and others, humbly address:

The Primordial Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure and the Unoriginated,
The Supreme Dao Lord of the Limitless Great Way,
The Most High Jade Emperor,
The Great Perfected Saints who have attained the Dao,
The Host of Perfected Ones,
The Venerable Lords,
The Thirty-Two Celestial Emperors,
The Jade Void Emperor,
The Jade Emperor,
The Great Emperor,
Donghua,
Nanji,
Xiling,
Beizhen,
The Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace in the Jade Capital of Xuandu,
The Numinous Treasure Perfected Sovereign of Luminous Augustness—

We, by karmic affinity from past lives, were born in an age of Daoic transformation. Through the mysterious and true, we were awakened and delivered, gaining entry into the root of faith. Our former masters transmitted to us the sacred scriptures of the Three Treasures. We have made offerings and paid reverence, placing merit-making first. Now we respectfully present so-and-so and others for transmission and ordination.

If receiving the Ten Precepts, one may say: *The Ten Precepts and Fourteen Articles for Upholding the Body*.
If receiving the *Five Thousand Characters*, one may say: *The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue in Five Thousand Characters*.
If receiving the Three Sovereigns, one may say: *The Jade Script Talismans and Charts of the Cavernous Spirit Three Sovereigns*.
If receiving the True Writs, one may say: *The Jade Script Talismans and Charts of the Numinous Treasure True Writs*.
If receiving the Highest Clarity, one may say: *The Jade Script Talismans and Charts of the Cavernous Truth Highest Clarity*.

If five ranks are received together in the same assembly, one may collectively record the preceding five methods. After bathing in purity and burning incense, lighting lamps, reciting scriptures, and performing the circumambulation, in accordance with the ritual, one invokes the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Perfected Ones, Divine Persons, Sages, the Thirty-Two Celestial Overseers of the Fast, the Golden Lads who attend the incense, the Jade Maidens who scatter flowers, the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors—thirty-two of each—along with the messengers who transmit words and memorials, the flying dragon riders, and others, to descend together and oversee the fast hall. Having made the incense offering and voiced the vows, which ascend as they are spoken, once the proceedings are complete, one reports back to the Perfected Officials.

The above is excerpted from the *Regulations of Luminous Perfection*.

Next, the method for replenishing the incense burner:

Incense Officials and Messengers,
Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger,
All the spirit officials who attend the incense—
may they cause the chamber of stillness to naturally generate the golden liquid, the cinnabar essence, and the numinous mushrooms.
May the host of Perfected Ones and the hundred spirits gather before this incense fire.
We pray that so-and-so and others may receive blessings under heaven and be favored in the ten directions.
May the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attend the incense smoke, transmit our words, and present them directly before the Supreme and Limitless Dao.

The above is excerpted from the *Regulations of Luminous Perfection*.

Next, the recitation of the Precepts and Hymns:

The Dao is the school of no-mind,
the field where all merit is sown.
No fixed master presides over merit-making—
each follows their own original vow.
Empty the self to respond to all beings,
direct the mind without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,
like rain falling from the heavens,
reaching all, high and low,
while the lowly become profound.
The sea is sovereign of the hundred rivers,
for it can contain dragons and scaled creatures.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom and function are preserved—
how could this depend on a single lifetime?
Hold fast to the precepts without the slightest lapse,
and in life after life, good affinities will form.
With concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
and you shall embody the true Dao.

The above is excerpted from the *Scripture of the Divine Lord’s Inquiries*.

Next, the method of the oratory’s esoteric invocation:

Mysterious and supreme, the Great Yin,
the eight windows open in clarity.
Before the maiden who communicates with spirits,
present your entreaty.
When the matter is complete,
the myriad spirits return to their places in profound stillness.

The above is excerpted from the *Scripture of the Golden Register*.

*Esoteric Essentials of the Supreme*, Scroll 35, concludes.

*Esoteric Essentials of the Supreme*, Scroll 37:
The Rites for Transmitting the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue*

The Method for Receiving the Pledge of the *Five Thousand Characters*:

A person must offer fifty feet of white silk and one golden dragon. If one has cultivated merit and conduct but is impoverished and unable to comply, one may adjust the offering according to one’s means, rather than strictly adhering to the scripture’s standard.

The above is excerpted from the *Scripture of Hidden Annotations*.

The Method for the Initial Esoteric Invocation upon Entering the Oratory:

The Four Luminaries’ Merit Officers, Messengers Who Communicate with the Perfected, Speech-Conveying Merit Officers, and Jade Maidens Who Serve in Stillness—may they transmit my words to the presiding deities of the Dao chamber. May the primordial qi of the Upper Prime enter my body.

The above is excerpted from the *Scripture of the Golden Register*.

Next, chant the invocation for stillness in accordance with the proper method.

Next, the Method for Contemplating the Three Masters:

First, contemplate the direction where the Scripture Master resides. Bow in the heart three times, praying that the master attain transcendence and that my own body ascend and be delivered.

Next, contemplate the direction where the Register Master resides. Bow in the heart three times, praying that the master attain the flying transcendents, open the path for my seven generations of ancestors, and swiftly ascend to the celestial halls, so that I may attain the true Dao and ascend into the formless.

Next, contemplate the direction where the Ordination Master resides. Bow in the heart three times, praying that the master ascend and be delivered, attaining the ranks of the lofty transcendents, open the path for me through the five destinies and eight adversities, inscribe my name in the transcendents’ register, and forever make me a Perfected.

The above is excerpted from the *Scripture of the Jade Register*.

Next, the Method for Kindling the Incense Burner:

The Most High Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Beginning, the Three Non-Beings’ Most High Lord Lao—summon forth from within so-and-so’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Riding Couriers Who Bear Incense, the Golden Lads Who Attend the Incense, the Jade Maidens Who Scatter Flowers and Convey Words, and the Thirty-Six Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans. Once they emerge, let them don their regalia and report to the true officials and presiding deities of this land and territory. I now burn incense and confer ordination, praying that the qi of the Most High’s ten directions’ true and perfected may enter my body. May my entreaty swiftly reach the presence of the Most High’s Boundless Great Dao, the Utmost Perfected Jade Thearch.

The above is excerpted from the *Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected*.

Next, the Method for Venerating the Three Treasures:

With utmost sincerity, I bow my head to the Most High’s Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, I bow my head to the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, I bow my head to the Great Master of the Mysterious Tradition.

The above is excerpted from the *Ritual of the Golden Register*.

Next, master and disciple kneel in reverence as the covenant text is read aloud.

On the first day of the such-and-such month in the year of the Celestial Stem and Branch Jia-Yi, the devout disciple so-and-so of such-and-such district, county, township, and village, aged such-and-such years, along with others, has long been ensnared by the senses—eyes and ears drawn to sounds and sights, body and mind stained by glory and favor—ever harboring desires, with no means to return to purity. We have heard that in the boundless, ageless seventh month, on the day of Jia-Zi, the August Elder, about to pass westward through the Hangu Pass, encountered Lord Xi of the Pass, who delighted in long life and sought to receive the scripture of a single word from an enlightened master. The Old Master said: "Excellent indeed is your question! My Dao runs deep and must not be transmitted carelessly. The Dao of life enters the abdomen, where spirit and luminosity are preserved; the hundred joints and orifices, the six Jia spirits, all interconnect within the body, weaving without end. Embracing embryonic breathing to guard the center, one unites above with Heaven. Practicing this, one becomes an immortal on the spot and is ordained as a Perfected. If transmitted without proper method, calamity befalls the body—life ends, name perishes, and descendants fall into ruin." Though we are but fleshly beings without wisdom, we have secretly cherished this teaching without cease, our resolve unwavering, earnestly hoping to receive and uphold it.

Now, in accordance with the statutes of the Illuminated Perfected, bearing tokens of faith, I vow with sincere heart to journey to the Three Caverns Master of [specific prefecture, commandery, county, village, and hamlet], Master [Mountain Name] of [Personal Name], to receive the Five Writings of the Dao and Virtue. I shall cultivate and revere them as the treasure of my body, swearing an unbreakable covenant. Should I violate the statutes or breach the pact, may I be bound in the eternal darkness of the Nine Prisons, without protest.

—From *The Rites for Transmitting the Five Thousand Character Register*

Next, the master holds the scripture while the ritual drums resound thirty-six times.

**Visualization Practice:**
First, visualize the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird before, the Dark Warrior behind, and beneath your feet the Eight Trigrams Spirit Tortoise. Thirty-six lions prostrate before you. A kerchief adorned with the Seven Stars crowns your head. The five viscera generate the five *qi*, and a net of scriptural patterns covers your body. The Three Ones attend the scripture, each accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders for protection.

—From *The Esoteric Commentary Scripture*

Next, recite the transmission hymn:

O’er the ethereal peaks they drift,
Radiant light dwells in the Supreme Mystery.
From beginning to end, through endless kalpas,
It eternally preserves Heaven, Earth, and Humankind.
Worldly lords seek to attain Brahman,
While Daoists chant and attain it.
The worthy now receive and uphold it,
Transmitting it in accord with the method.
In this age, no Perfected One appears,
This treasure is not carelessly revealed.
Hold fast to it, ascend to Great Clarity;
Discard it, and fall into the Nine Dark Realms.
I expound the Dao of Non-Action—
Serene and still, it is attained naturally.

—From *The Rites for Transmitting the Five Thousand Character Register*

Next, the master bestows the scripture, and the disciple kneels to receive it, then returns to their place. When all is complete, each bows to the master three times.

Next, take refuge in all the Venerable Dao:

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Jade Dawn Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Upper Realm in the North.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Perfected Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Sage Realm in the Northeast.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Jade Treasure August Heavenly Worthy of the East.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast, Who Nurtures Life and Delivers Destiny.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Mysterious Perfected Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings in the South.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Supreme Numinous Void August Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Supreme Wondrous Utmost Heavenly Worthy of the West.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Boundless Supreme Florescence Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Jade Void Luminous August Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Perfected August Heavenly Worthy of the Cavern Spirits in the Lower Realm.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Highest Jade August Heavenly Worthy of the Past.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Present.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Supreme Ultimate Heavenly Worthy of the Future.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Jade Capital and the Mysterious Terrace of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in all the Perfected Immortals and Attained Sage Hosts.

—From *The Numinous Treasure Scripture*

Next, chant three hymns in unison, circling once.

The great worthy delights in the scripture and precepts,
Receiving them as the treasure of the body.
To seek learning is ever belated,
To cultivate the body, one regrets not starting sooner.
All must delve into the profound and obscure,
Yet time slips by, and years grow old.
Grasping the scroll, one draws near the ultimate,
Only to face death’s bitter sorrow.
Thus, in my youth, I abandoned the world to study the Dao.
To practice immortality is urgent,
To uphold the precepts and restrain the heart’s passions.
Let emptiness and equanimity dwell in the upright *qi*,
And immortals and sages will naturally seek you.
If you do not trust these teachings,
Why dwell in the mountains?

—From *The Scripture on Dispelling Demons*

To study immortality, sever worldly attachments,
Each thought accumulates upon the last.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
Restless, it cannot endure.
Extinguish thoughts, abide in tranquil emptiness,
And softly enter the silence of the void.
Seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst,
Hold fast to your resolve like gold or stone.
Preserve this, and you shall soar the mysterious path,
The Five Numinous Ones will deliver your talismanic register.

—From *The Esoteric Commentary on the Supreme Ultimate*

Next, the master faces east to return the immortal officials:

The Supreme Numinous Treasure, Unsurpassed Three Caverns disciple, Master [Mountain Name] of [Personal Name], and others, now reverently address:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneity,
The Supreme Dao Lord of the Boundless Dao,
The Highest Jade August One and all the Attained Great Sage Perfected Hosts,
The Lords and Elders,
The Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,
The Jade Void Emperor,
The Jade Emperor,
The Great Emperor,
Eastern Florescence,
Southern Culmen,
Western Numinosity,
Northern Perfection,
Mysterious Capital,
Jade Capital,
Golden Watchtower,
Seven Jeweled Mysterious Terrace,
Purple Tenuity Upper Palace,
Numinous Treasure Perfected Ones,
Luminous August Lord of the Dao—
We, by karmic affinity of past lives, were born amidst the transformation of the Dao. The Mysterious Perfected guided and delivered us, enabling us to enter the root of faith. Our former masters swore oaths and transmitted the Three Treasures’ divine scriptures. We revered and served them, making merit our priority. On [specific date], we respectfully transmitted the scriptures and practiced the Dao with [Personal Name] and others, establishing the fast and vigil, burning incense, and making repentant vows.

Now that the transmission is complete, we invoke the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Perfected Ones, Divine Humans, Sages, Overseers of the Fast, Attendant Incense Lads, Jade Maidens Who Scatter Flowers, Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, Messengers Who Transmit Words, Flying Dragon Riders, and all who have overseen the fast, guarded and labored diligently. May each be rewarded according to their merit, advance in rank and grade, and restore their celestial positions. We now reverently make this report.

Next, restore the incense burner:

Incense Officials and Envoys,
Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger,
Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense—
May the quiet chamber naturally generate the golden liquid elixir and azure mushroom blossoms. May the host of Perfected and the hundred spirits gather before this incense fire. We pray that after [Personal Name] and others receive the Dao, the multitude of spirits will protect and escort them, that they may swiftly attain immortality.

May the Emperor enjoy myriad blessings,
May the world receive grace.
Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions,
Attendants of the fragrant smoke—
Transmit these words directly to the presence of the Supreme Boundless Dao.

—From *The Scripture of Illuminating Perfection*

Next, recite the hymn of upholding the precepts:

The Dao is the origin of Non-Heart,
All acts are fields of merit.
To establish merit has no fixed master,
Each vow arises from the individual.
Empty yourself to respond to all beings,
Focus your heart without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,
As rain descends from heaven.
Lofty peaks are universally embraced,
Yet the humble become profound.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
For it can contain dragons and krakens.
Through ten thousand kalpas, preserve wisdom and function,
Not merely for the span of years.
Uphold the precepts without the slightest lapse,
And in every life, good affinities shall form.
With concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the true Dao.

—From *The Scripture of the Immortal Duke’s Inquiry*

Next, the Esoteric Invocation of the Daoist Altar:

The Mysterious Upper and Supreme Yin,
Eight windows open in radiance.
When supplication is made,
The Maiden transmits the numinous.
Once the affair is complete, return to position,
And the ten thousand spirits shall silently settle.

—From *The Scripture of the Golden Register*

*End of Volume Thirty-Seven of The Supreme Secret Essentials*

---

**Volume Thirty-Eight: The Rites of Conferring the Cavernous Divine and Three Sovereigns**

**The Altar Arrangement:**
Next, arrange the altar after the night’s dew has settled. The altar’s length and breadth should be either thirty-two feet or twenty-four feet, with height and expanse adjusted according to the number of participants. Open three gates: the Gate of the Celestial Sovereign at *zi*, the Gate of the Terrestrial Sovereign at *shen*, and the Gate of the Human Sovereign at *yin*. Each gate shall bear an inscribed placard. Adorn the railings with lamps and fires, adjusting their number as needed. Entry and exit must be made through the Gate of the Human Sovereign.

—From *The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Retreat*

**The Seating of the Three Sovereigns:**
For the Celestial Sovereign’s seat: spread eighteen lengths of black silk.
For the Terrestrial Sovereign’s seat: spread sixteen lengths of white silk.
For the Human Sovereign’s seat: spread sixteen lengths of blue-green silk.

—From *The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Retreat*

**The Three Sovereigns’ Life-Link Pledges:**

The Life-Link Pledges correspond to the years of one’s life: the Son of Heaven uses lengths in *pi*, dukes and marquises use lengths in *zhang*, and commoners use lengths in *chi*. The same applies to the three seats. The Son of Heaven uses purple damask; others use plain silk according to the directional colors. All are placed upon the Human Sovereign’s table, along with three golden dragons. Commoners use golden rings.

—From *The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Retreat*

**The Three Sovereigns’ Ritual Pledges:**
The pledge consists of four hundred *chi* of white silk; for the impoverished, forty *chi*. These include the seat stabilizers, life-link pledges, and the three kinds of ritual offerings. If one possesses merit and conduct but is too poor to prepare them fully, one may adjust according to one’s means; this should not be taken as the standard.

—From *The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Retreat*

**Next: Entering the Altar, Burning Incense, and Activating the Brazier**
The maiden of incense smoke ascends to report to the August Lords, the Lesser Manifestation of the Perfected, [name and cyclical year], who has purified through retreat, severed worldly dust, and awaits the numinous convergence of the Five Penetrations. May the highest aspiration be fulfilled, calamities extinguished, blessings born, and ascent achieved to the Three Heavens.

—From *The Scripture of the Numinous Treasure Retreat*

**Next: Facing north, bow twice to the Perfected Lord of the Celestial Sovereign.**

Next, face southwest and bow twice to the Perfected Lord of the Earthly Sovereign. Then, face northeast and bow twice to the Perfected Lord of the Human Sovereign. Next, unfurl the first two *chi* of the received scripture upon the altar table, and bow twice together. The disciple prostrates to the east from the west side, while the master kneels facing west, reciting their titles and positions.

The disciple, a minor manifestation of the Perfected, [name and cyclical year], of the Three Caverns, respectfully addresses: Supreme Primordial Lady, Great Divinities of the Immortal Capital, and the Three August Perfected Lords—this disciple now seeks to transmit the precious scriptures of the Three Sovereigns to [name, prefecture, county, village, and given name]. May it be permitted?

Prostrate and await the command. Remain prostrate for the duration of one incense burning. When no wind stirs, rise and bow twice as a disciple. Prostrate again, while the master kneels and reads the covenant text:

In the cyclical year [year], the [month], the [day] of the [cyclical day], the pure and faithful disciple [name], aged [age], from [prefecture, county, village], now approaches Master [name], of the Sacred Peak, to receive the inner scriptures of the Three Sovereigns, the celestial texts in great characters, along with all talismans. The offerings are presented according to ritual propriety, and the covenant is sealed with the elixir of immortal waters, marked with a single stroke as token.

[Name] as transmitter of the Dao shall not conceal truth or disseminate falsehood. [Name] as recipient of the Dao shall uphold the master’s covenant and oath, refraining from unfilial conduct, lack of benevolence, disloyalty, or malice; from greed, lust, or violence; from reckless transmission to the unworthy; from blaming the master or resenting the Dao; or from hypocrisy. After attaining the Dao, should one betray the original master or slander the true and orthodox, one shall incur great calamity in this life, extending to descendants.

Next, both sip the elixir water and jointly inscribe a single vermilion stroke beneath the covenant text.

Then, the disciple prostrates before the offerings while the master, holding the scripture, kneels.

Visualize the deities of the Three Palaces: within each palace resides a Perfected One, appearing as an infant, unclothed, exhaling purple *qi*, which flows through master, disciple, and all present.

Next, the transmission of the scripture is chanted:
The celestial texts of the Supreme,
Recount the origins of heaven and earth.
The August Ones proclaimed the mysterious decree,
As the scriptures of utmost truth.
The worthy now receive and uphold them,
Aspiring to ascend to the Great Void.

—From *The Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate’s Esoteric Commentary*

Next, the disciple kneels to receive the scripture. Upon completion, bow twice to the master. Then, master and disciple each bow twice to the Three August Lords.

Next, chant the *Yang Songs* three times, circling thrice:
The azure-horned *Yang Song* resounds,
Wafting through the ten directions.
Azure radiance illumines the world,
Bearing me to the ninefold heavens.
The western string strikes its tune,
Awakening the Eastern August Lord.
The Primordial Cavern initiates its course,
As yang first sprouts myriad buds.
Harmonious winds stir jade branches,
Lofty forests gleam with cloudy veils.
Gou Mang urges the farmer’s toil,
Sun-feathered wings blaze in eastern dawn.
Immortal sages wander the Mystic Garden,
Soaring chants rise with clarion calls.
They rein in their light in the chambers of great auroras,
Aligning wheels in the courts of the nine heavens.
All immortals lift their soaring chants,
The *Yang Poems* resound in due season.
Were one not of the spiritually attuned,
How could one partake in this transformative rite?

—From *The Scripture of the Cavernous Divinity*

Next, the method of returning to the immortal office.

Supreme Perfected Disciples of the Three Caverns of the Numinous Treasure, Master So-and-So of Such-and-Such Mountain, So-and-So and others, humbly address:

The Vast-Void-Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
The Boundless Great Dao Supreme Lord of the Dao,
The Exalted Jade Emperor and the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao,
All Lords and Elders,
The Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,
The Jade Void Emperor,
The Jade Emperor,
The Great Emperor,
Eastern Florescence,
Southern Culmen,
Western Numinosity,
Northern Perfection,
Mystic Capital,
Jade Capital,
Golden Portals,
Seven-Jewel Dark Terrace,
Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
Numinous Treasure Perfected Ones,
Radiant August Lord of the Dao—

We, by karmic affinity of former lives, were born to encounter the transformative power of the Dao. The Mystic Perfection initiated our deliverance, enabling us to enter the root of faith. Our former masters, through sacred covenants, transmitted the Three Treasures’ divine scriptures. We have upheld reverent offerings and rites, prioritizing merit above all. On such-and-such day of such-and-such month, we, together with So-and-So and others, transmitted the scriptures and practiced the Dao, establishing the fast and vigil, burning incense and offering repentance.

Now that the transmission is complete, we invoke the presence of the Heavenly Immortals, Earthbound Immortals, Flying Immortals, Perfected Ones, Divine Beings, Sages, Overseers of the Fast and Vigil, Golden Lads who attend the incense, Jade Maidens who scatter blossoms, Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, Messengers who transmit words and memorials, and Flying Dragon Riders. May they deign to oversee this place of fasting, safeguarding and laboring diligently. According to their merits, may they each receive rewards, ascend in rank and grade, and restore their celestial positions. We humbly present this memorial for your august attention.

—From *The Scripture of Radiant Perfection*

Next, the method of restoring the furnace:

The Maiden of Incense Smoke ascends to report to the August Lord. The minor perfected, So-and-So, having purified the fast and severed worldly dust, aspires to the five spiritual penetrations. May our highest wish be to attain perfection, extinguish calamities, and generate blessings, ascending to the Three Heavens.

Next, recite one verse before departing:

The pursuit of immortality is urgent,
Devotion to precepts restrains the heart’s passions.

The pure and serene primordial qi resides,
Immortal sages naturally seek one another.
If one does not believe the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in the mountain forests?

—From *The Scripture of Dispelling Demons*

*Volume Thirty-Eight of The Supreme Secret Essentials* concludes here.

---

**Volume Thirty-Nine: The Rites for Transmitting the Cavernous Mystery’s True Writ**
*Volume Thirty-Nine of The Supreme Secret Essentials*

**Method for Establishing the Altar and Fasting Under the Stars:**

The method for the numinous altar: the altar’s length and width should be twenty-four feet, or thirty-two feet, adjusted according to the number of participants. The four sides each have gate curtains, each nine feet long. Five gates are constructed, each five feet wide (or four feet). The remaining curtains are seven feet long.

Two strands of blue-green cord connect the gate placards. Each placard is three inches and two fen wide, and three inches and four fen long.

- **Primordial Yang Gate of Azure Radiance** in the east: inscribed in vermilion on a blue-green placard.
- **Great Radiance Cavernous Yang Gate** in the south: inscribed in yellow on a red placard.
- **Golden Watchtower of Pervading Yin Gate** in the west: inscribed in black on a white placard.
- **Vast Spirit of Yin’s Genesis Gate** in the north: inscribed in blue-green on a black placard.
- **Lofty Dawn of Primordial Yellow Gate** beneath the King’s Gate, above the four seasons: inscribed in white on a yellow placard.
- **Gate of the Assembly of Upper Immortals and Perfected** above the King’s Gate: inscribed in purple on a yellow placard.

The six gates above may be used in simplified form. If employing a double altar with ten gates, arrange them according to *The Yellow Register Scripture*.

The Central Gate corresponds to the four seasons, beneath the King’s Gate and above the four seasons. The Gate of the Assembly of Perfected is above the King’s Gate and the four first months of the seasons.

- **Spring King** in *mao* (卯): Central Gate in *chou* (丑), Gate of the Assembly of Perfected in *si* (巳).
- **Summer King** in *wu* (午): Central Gate in *chen* (辰), Gate of the Assembly of Perfected in *shen* (申).
- **Autumn King** in *you* (酉): Central Gate in *wei* (未), Gate of the Assembly of Perfected in *hai* (亥).
- **Winter King** in *zi* (子): Central Gate in *xu* (戌), Gate of the Assembly of Perfected in *yin* (寅).

The King’s Gate has no separate gate. In spring, use the Azure Radiance Gate; in summer, the Cavernous Yang Gate; in autumn, the Pervading Yin Gate; in winter, the Yin’s Genesis Gate. Enter and exit through the Gate of the Assembly of Perfected.

**Method for the Six Grades of Offerings:**

- Five bolts of five-colored silk, as tokens for the Five Emperors.
- Nine golden dragons, as tokens for the Nine Heavens, each weighing one tael.
- Five golden dragons, as tokens for the Five Marchmounts, each weighing one tael.
- Twenty-four thousand gold coins, as tokens for the twenty-four qi of life.
- Life-destiny silk, its length corresponding to the recipient’s age:
  - The Son of Heaven uses one bolt,
  - Dukes and kings use one *zhang*,
  - Commoners use one *chi*.
  The regulations are as specified.

If one cannot afford these alone, they may be provided collectively.

If the collective cannot afford these, let the amount be measured according to wealth and poverty.

**Method for Setting Up the Offering Tables:**
- Place one table at each of the Five Gates. On each table, set one incense burner, one dragon, and one bolt of silk matching the directional color. One table holds the scriptures, with a red cloth beneath and a blue cloth covering them, placed before the honored image. One table is for presenting memorials and petitions before the master. One table holds the nine golden dragons, gold coins, and other tokens, placed before the honored image.

**Method for Entering the Altar and Kindling the Incense at Nightfall:**
Invoke the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three Qi, the Most High Lord Lao: summon forth from within the bodies of so-and-so the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Courier Dragon Riders, the Incense-Attending Golden Lads, the Speech-Transmitting Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, and the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans—thirty-six of each—who, upon emerging, shall attire themselves in full regalia. Notify the local earth deities and territorial spirits to attend. Then, burn incense beneath the open sky at the altar, present the yellow silk memorial, and pray that the Most High’s ten directions of true and perfect qi enter the bodies of so-and-so, so that their petition may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Perfect and True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate.

**Method for Reading the Yellow Silk Memorial:**
The Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Three Caverns Perfected, the Master of Such-and-Such Mountain, so-and-so, bows twice and respectfully addresses:

To the Primordial Origin Five Venerable Emperors, the Perfect and True Great Sage Honored Deities, the Jade August Thearch: I, of humble essence born into this world, have encountered karmic conditions. Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, the wheel of rebirth has not ceased. By the grace of accumulated blessings and felicitous destiny flowing into this present life, I have been able to enter the Dharma Gate. Formerly, on such-and-such a year, month, day, and cyclical sign, I received from my late master, the Three Caverns Perfected of Such-and-Such Mountain, so-and-so, the transmission of the Numinous Treasure Cavernous Mystery Scripture, Talismans, and Jade Characters, which I have cultivated and worn upon my person.

Now, the Daoist disciple so-and-so, aged such-and-such, along with so-and-so and others, has brought tokens of faith and pledged devotion, seeking to receive the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture, Talismans, and Jade Characters of the Kingly Script in five fascicles. If there are additional scripture fascicles, they shall be listed according to their number. They vow to cultivate, uphold, and treasure these forever as their personal treasure.

Having observed their sincere diligence, noble aspirations, and the accumulated blessings of past lives that have enabled them to partake of these sacred texts and peruse their chapters and verses, it is fitting that they attain the perfection of the Dao. Yet I fear that so-and-so may lack a transcendent name or meritorious deeds, that the Three Realms do not record them, and that the Five Emperors do not recognize them. Therefore, in accordance with the Bright Statutes and the revealed texts of the central altar, I prostrate myself and humbly memorialize, that this may ascend to the Nine Heavens. May the August and Holy Honored Deities deign to illuminate the matters herein presented, take pity on this sincere heart, and, in their boundless compassion, the Perfect and True Great Dao of the Nine Heavens and the Supreme Honored Deities, discern and show mercy. I await your decree and response. With utmost reverence and trepidation, I bow twice and submit this.

Your servant, of such-and-such surname, from such-and-such commandery and county,
To the Supreme Primordial Origin Great Dao Lord, the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Five Venerable Ones, and the Jade Emperor Great Sage, the Jade August Thearch,
Respectfully presented on such-and-such a cyclical year, month, and day, from such-and-such commandery, county, village, and hamlet.

*(From the* Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected.*)*

**Method for Sealing the Incense Burner:**

Let the Incense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all the attendant spirit-officials of incense ensure that within this hallowed chamber, golden liquid elixir, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure lingzhi spontaneously arise. May the host of perfected beings and the hundred spirits convene before this incense flame, and may we, your servants, be swiftly enveloped by divine guardianship to attain transcendence and perfection. May the August Thearch enjoy ten thousand blessings, and may the realm receive boundless grace.

The jade lads and jade maidens of the ten directions, who attend the incense smoke, shall convey these words directly before the Supreme and Boundless Dao of the Most High.

*(From the* Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected.*)*

**Next, the Precepts and Hymn of Praise:**

The Dao is the heartless origin,
The field where all merit is sown.
No fixed master claims the work,
For each vow springs from the self alone.
Empty the self to respond to all beings,
Focus the mind without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,
As rain descends from the heavens—
Lofty peaks are not left untouched,
Yet the humble become profound.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
For it contains dragons and scaled creatures.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom endures,
Not merely for a fleeting span of years.
Uphold the precepts without lapse,
And life after life, good affinities shall form.
With concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the true Dao.

*(From the* Scripture of Questions and Answers, Lower Scroll.*)*

**Next, the Esoteric Incantation for the Ritual Altar:**

Upon the Mysterious Upper Yin,
The eight windows open bright.
When there is something to be declared,
The Maiden transmits the numinous.
Once the matter is complete,
The myriad spirits withdraw in silence.

*(From the* Scripture of the Golden Register.*)*

**Next, the Esoteric Incantation at Dawn Outside the Door:**

O Luminous Officers of the Four Brightnesses, Envoys of Numinous Communication, Jade Lads Who Transmit Words, and Jade Maidens Who Attend in Stillness—convey my plea to the presiding deities of this Daoist chamber, that the primordial qi of the Upper Origin may enter my body.

*(From the* Scripture of the Golden Register.*)*

**Next, the Method for Kindling the Incense Burner:**

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao—summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Jade Lads Who Attend the Incense, the Jade Maidens Who Scatter Flowers, and the Direct Attendants of the Five Thearchs, thirty-six of each, to emerge and prepare in solemn array. Awaken the true officials and numinous deities governing this land and domain. As we now kindle this incense for the sake of such-and-such a matter, may the primordial qi of the Ten Directions’ perfected and true beings enter our bodies, that our supplication may swiftly ascend before the Supreme and Boundless Dao of the Most High, the Perfected □, and the Jade Emperor’s throne.

**Next, the Veneration of the Three Treasures:**

With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, we bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

**Next, the Master faces west, kneels, and recites the Covenant Text:**

The disciple, prostrate in faith...

In the year of the Great Year-Star [Tai Sui], the such-and-such month, the such-and-such day of the new moon, on the jia-yi day, Master of the Sacred Peak [Yue], so-and-so,
born in the jia-yi year, the such-and-such month of his destiny,
whose qi-lineage is registered under the Celestial Lord of such-and-such Heaven,
now in such-and-such Qi-Heaven, from Master of the Sacred Peak, so-and-so,
receives the forty-three chapters of talismanic diagrams and the nine hundred twenty-four characters of jade script,
seven numinous powers to guard the true,
golden silk to pledge the heart,
proclaiming before the spirits and swearing alliance to Heaven,
binding them as treasures of the body,
to uphold the Great Dharma,
to reverently follow the true canon,
and to report above to the thirty-two heavens’ overseers of the true register of deliverance.

The attendant Immortal Scribe, the Director of Records Han,
the Flying Celestial Perfected,
and the Divine Kings of the Three Realms
are commanded to strike his name from the register of death
and inscribe it upon the golden tablets and jade records of the Three Primes,
that in accordance with the majestic rites of the Great Pardon,
the qi of the true immortals may descend and enter his body.

The Celestial Marshal of the thirty-three heavens’ supervisory immortals,
the Feathered Scribe of the canon,
each according to their rank dispatch one measure of jade lads and jade maidens,
and one portion of the qi of the divine perfected,
to descend and attend the numinous script,
bestowing it upon the body of so-and-so,
universally informing all heavens and all earths,
the boundless worlds,
the sun, moon, and stellar lodges,
the officials of the Three Realms,
the famed mountains of the Five Peaks,
the water palaces of the Nine Rivers,
the bureaus of the Three Officials,
and the long night of the Nine Dark Springs,
where there is no shadow, no color,
no form, no name,
no sound, no echo,
no origin, no greatness,
no height, no depth,
no honor, no humility—
that all spirits and numina may clearly recognize so-and-so’s body,
upholding the Great Dharma,
bearing the celestial script,
whose name is entered in the immortal register of the Three Primes.

In going out and coming in, in wandering and journeying,
he shall be received according to the proper offices,
paying homage thrice monthly,
as in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace.
The earthly writs shall be erased,
the records of the Nine Darks expunged,
karmic adversaries annihilated,
evil roots severed and silenced,
so that none may pursue or seize him,
and through countless kalpas he shall remain unentangled.
Seven generations of ancestors shall share in this blessing,
all ascending together,
roaming freely in the Seven Jeweled Groves of the Mysterious Capital,
where souls receive refinement and deliverance,
and in due time attain rebirth.

So-and-so pledges to uphold the Great Dharma,
in all things conforming to the luminous perfected,
examining himself and following the precepts,
to achieve immortality in life and death,
to befriend the Five Thearchs,
and to sport among the heavens.

Should he break this covenant or betray this oath,
reveal the celestial script,
or transmit it beyond the proper time,
he shall answer in life and death,
bear eternal debt at the River’s source,
suffer the wind-knives for ten thousand kalpas,
and be crushed beneath the mountain of eternal night.
Thus shall retribution for sin and blessing for merit
be meted out exactly as this covenant declares.

Next, the Master sounds the Dharma drum thirty-six times,
while master and disciples each visualize the five viscera and their five colors,
fully arrayed to form a canopy of jeweled clouds,
covering the scripture master and the assembly of disciples.

The above is from the *Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected*.

Next, perform the Transmission of the Scripture with a hymn.

The celestial writ is not cumbersome,
for the Dao and its virtue are self-sufficient.
Cultivate it, and you shall surely become an immortal—
what more could you desire?
Its radiance shines in the Great Void,
brilliant and resplendent.
Transmission must follow the proper method;
leakage or negligence leads to the hells of earth.

Next, the disciple kneels before the master,
receiving the scripture, the divine staff, and the ritual tablet.
When this is done, each returns to their place
and bows three times to the master.
As for the placement of the talisman within the staff and the method for the ritual tablet:
if few are present, follow the later incantation rites for arrangement.
If many are present, it is fitting to seal all talismans within the fast
and confer them along with the scripture at the time of transmission.

This is from the *Scripture of Hidden Annotations*.

Next, pay homage by the Ten Directions:

I devote myself to all the Heavenly Worthies:
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mystic Prime, Jade Dawn, of the North.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Sage, Deliverer of Immortals, of the Northeast.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Sovereign, of the East.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Good Life and Deliverance, of the Southeast.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mystic Truth and Myriad Blessings, of the South.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous and Empty Sovereign, of the Southwest.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Mystery, of the West.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Splendor, of the Northwest.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void and Luminous Sovereign, of the Above.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Grotto Spirits, of the Below.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Highest Jade Sovereign of the Past.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Present.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Ultimate of the Future.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to the Jade Capital, Mystic Terrace, and Purple Tenuity Upper Palace.
With utmost sincerity, I devote myself to all perfected immortals and realized sages.

This is from the *Numinous Treasure Scripture*.

Next, chant the Hymn of the Three Perfected Ones:

The Great Dao Lord of the Supreme,
revealed these Numinous Treasure scriptures.
Lofty and wondrous, beyond compare,
like the mystery within the mystery.
The ten directions’ lands, all as one,
revere the supreme immortal.
Vast is the *Scripture of the Cavernous Void*,
as he sits in audience with the heavens.
Above, the Purple Tenuity Terrace;
below, the myriad named mountains.
Resplendent with dragon and phoenix script,
its brilliance shines in the boundless.
Wondrous is the Supreme Dao,
ever-natural in non-action.
Kings, lords, and common folk—
all esteem only loyalty and worth.
Those with karmic fortune from past lives
stand out from former causes.
Masters pass it on in turn,
treasured through kalpas of years.
Vastly mindful, deliver all beings—
great fortune shall be your reward.
Those who make offerings shall attain the Dao;
those who uphold it become perfected.
The Great Dao knows no self or other;
transmit it only to the worthy.
The Void and Constant are ever-natural—
forcedly named the Great Dao.
Vast and boundless, without limit,
all wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.
With eyes closed, visualize the Perfected;
with focused thought, summon the Ten Elders.
Ascend as an immortal, forever in non-action,
your numinous countenance ever wondrous and fair.
Thirst quenched by the jade pool’s nectar,
hunger sated by golden radiance herbs.
With pure wisdom, transcend the eight difficulties,
relieving the world’s myriad sufferings.
All wonders emerge from the Cavernous Mystery,
brilliant and shining in the Great Clarity.
Those who uphold it are called immortals,
their bodies eternal, everlasting.
Carefree, they play in the Mystic Void,
palaces arrayed in formless splendor.
Resplendent, the seven-jeweled groves,
radiant as the sun and moon’s essence.
Dragons and unicorns race in crisscross,
phoenixes soar with mournful cries.
The Supreme rules the Purple Terrace,
while the host of perfected chant the Cavern scriptures.
Offering incense, they bow in reverence,
circumambulating the palace walls.
Three circuits return to the high seat,
the jade of the Dao answering their voices.
Should the lord of men propagate the Supreme Dao,
the world shall know universal peace.

Next, the master kneels facing east and returns the immortal offices.

The Supreme Numinous Treasure, Unsurpassed Three Caverns disciples [names] respectfully address:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Natural,
the Supreme Ultimate Great Dao Lord of the Limitless,
the Highest Jade Sovereign,
the perfected and realized great sages,
the Lords and Elders,
the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,
the Jade Void Emperor,
the Jade Emperor,
the Great Emperor,
Eastern Florescence,
Southern Culmen,
Western Numinous,
Northern Perfected,
Mystic Capital,
Jade Capital,
Golden Watchtower,
Seven Treasures,
Mystic Terrace,
Purple Tenuity Upper Palace,
Numinous Treasure Perfected,
Luminous Sovereign Lord—
we, by karmic causes from past lives,
were born to encounter the transformative power of the Dao.
The Mystic Perfected initiated and guided us,
enabling us to enter the root of faith.
Our former masters transmitted the Three Treasures’ divine scriptures,
and we made offerings and revered them,
placing merit-making first.
On this day of such-and-such month,
we respectfully transmitted the scriptures and practiced the Dao
with [names], establishing the fast and vigil,
burning incense and making repentant vows.
Now that the transmission is complete,
we invoke the Heavenly Immortals,
Earthly Immortals,
Flying Immortals,
Perfected Ones,
Divine Humans,
Sages,
Overseers of the Fast and Vigil,
Incense-Attending Golden Lads,
Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
Jade Emperor’s Direct Talismans,
Flying Dragon Couriers who transmit and memorialize—
all who have overseen this fast,
labored in its defense,
and shall be rewarded according to their merit,
advancing in rank and grade,
restoring their celestial positions.
We respectfully address this memorial.

This is from the *Scripture of Natural Principles*.

Next, restore the incense burner:

Incense Officials and Envoys,
Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger,
and all spirit officials attending the incense,
may the altar’s purity naturally generate
golden liquid cinnabar and azure mushrooms.
May the host of perfected and myriad spirits
gather here before this incense fire altar.
We pray that after receiving the Dao,
all gods shall protect and guard us,
hastening our attainment of immortal perfection.
May the emperor enjoy myriad blessings,
and the world receive grace.

The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions,
attending the incense smoke,
transmit this memorial
directly to the presence of the Supreme Limitless Dao.

This is from the *Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected*.

Next, the Hymn of Offering the Precepts:

The Dao is the school of no-mind,
All acts become fields of merit.
Establishing merit has no fixed master,
Each person’s original vow depends on themselves.
Empty the self to respond to all beings,
Focus the mind without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,
Like rain descending from heaven.
High peaks are all encompassed,
Yet the lowly become profound as abysses.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
Thus it contains dragons and unicorns.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom is preserved,
Not merely for one’s own years.
Upholding the precepts without momentary lapse,
Life after life, good affinities are formed.
With concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the true Dao.

This is from the *Scripture of Questions and Answers, Lower Volume*.

Next, the Method of Secret Invocations in the Daoist Altar:

Mysterious and supreme, the Great Yin,
Eight windows open to clarity.
When there is something to report,
The Maiden transmits the numinous.
When the matter is complete, return to your station,
And the myriad spirits shall silently rest.

This is from the *Scripture of the Golden Register*.

*Supreme Mystery and Essential Secrets, Scroll Thirty-Nine* concludes.

*Supreme Mystery and Essential Secrets, Scroll Forty*

**Ritual of Transmitting the Cavern-Real Upper Clarity**

**Method of Setting Up the Altar:**
First, set up an altar measuring twenty-four feet in length and width, or thirty-two feet, with height and size adjusted according to the number of participants. Adorn the four sides with tassels and establish gates at the four corners, each gate four feet wide, not aligned directly with the Heavenly Gate.

Next, prepare the golden dragons, bright mirrors, stabilizing silks, and the life-destiny silk.

**Method of Arrangement:**
Nine taels of gold, one dragon per tael.
Place them on the central table.
Five bright mirrors.
Place them on the tables of the five directions.
Forty feet of five-colored silk for each direction.
Place them on the tables of the five directions.
The life-destiny silk, its color corresponding to the year’s direction, measured in bolts for the Son of Heaven, in zhang for princes and dukes, and in chi for commoners. The Son of Heaven and nobles use damask, while commoners use plain silk, placed on the table according to the life-destiny color.

**Method of Placing the Tables:**
One table holds the scriptures, covered with red and blue cloths, placed in the center of the altar.
One table is placed in the center, holding the nine dragons.
Five tables, each with incense and the colored mirrors, are placed in the five directions.

**Next, the Ritual of Vigil at the Exposed Altar at Night:**
After arranging the altar at night, the master and disciples enter through the northwest Heavenly Gate. They knock their teeth thirty-six times, visualizing purple qi covering the crown of the altar and the Five Thearchs’ divine soldiers—one hundred thousand in number—coming to welcome the disciple’s body. Then they invoke:

The divine perfected depart on their journey,
The myriad thearchs are startled and alarmed.
The Mysterious Guardians of the Jade Void,
The celestial lodges overturn in reverence.
The officials of the Five Peaks,
All assist with numinous power.
Commanding the ten directions,
Driving and directing the celestial soldiers,
Leading all below heaven,
To assemble at the imperial court.
Grant that I ascend as an immortal,
And penetrate the essence of the Dao.
Discerning what is inauspicious,
Communicating with the hidden and exploring the obscure.
All that is directed and declared,
Shall accord with the Jade Clarity.

Next, enter the altar, circumambulate once, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-six times.

**Method of Invoking the Incense Burner:**
Supreme Three Heavens,
Primordial Origin, Beginning Three Qi,
Most High Dao Lord,
Summon forth from within the bodies of so-and-so
The Flying Immortal Merit Officers of the Void and Natural,
Divine Immortal Envoys,
Left and Right Flying Dragons,
Great Perfected Jade Maidens,
Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans,
Thirty-six of each,
And the local earth deities and true spirits of this place.
We now properly burn incense and keep vigil,
May what we report swiftly reach
The presence of the Jade Emperor of the Limitless,
Before the lofty assembly of the myriad sages.

Next, face north, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and recite the **Method of Subduing Demons:**

Heavenly demons ride the void,
Myriad spirits startle the divine court.
Assuming transformations, they chant deceptive songs,
Shifting forms to enter the nameless.
How clamorous is their chaotic qi,
Defiling the Dao, arising along the path.
In the clouds, they dwell in vermilion palaces,
The Brave Divine Soldiers of the Northern Thearch.
The drum resounds, and they know themselves,
The mysterious movement comes to summon them.
The upper luminaries feast with flying reins,
Swift chariots inspect the cloud camps.
Hastening to consult the Northern Thearch’s register,
Seizing and capturing the names of the demonic hordes.
The Fallen Ones spread the celestial net,
Unleashing power, casting flowing bells.
Golden perfected capture the empty cavern,
Jade radiance illuminates the eight darknesses.
Golden mystery guards the upper palace,
Divine tigers slay celestial spirits.
Severing and extinguishing the myriad demonic qi,
Countless billions are all pacified.
Receiving the trust of the Nine Heavens,
Whistling commands, none dare disobey.
Summoning the perfected, exploring the Three Caverns,
Wisdom recitation shines at dawn’s clarity.
Gazing at the

To all myriad spirits, proclaim upon the floating imperial altar.
Guard and protect, dispel trials—proceed as the great perfected.
At tomorrow’s dawn, command the transmission of the revealed writ.
Then expose the writ’s text upward.

Next, face east, stand level, strike the teeth three times, and perform the incense-burning invocation:
Five Marchmounts, Five Thearchs, divine transcendents and messengers,
Three Origins’ true perfected, left and right Dragon-Tiger,
Heavenly transcendents, earthly transcendents, flying transcendents,
Five Numinous Fragrance Officials—
Summon now the ten directions’ true qi,
The spontaneous golden liquid, cinnabar-green mushroom blossoms,
Nine Mysteries’ jade perfected,
To gather and meet within the altar,
To thoroughly irrigate our bodies,
That we who seek the Dao may attain the Dao,
Those who seek transcendence may attain transcendence,
Soaring through the Great Void,
Ascending in radiance to the Nine Heavens.
Jade lads and jade maidens,
Attend the incense smoke,
Conveying the revealed petition
To the august presence of the Highest, Boundless, Great Dao Jade Emperor.

Next, circumambulate while chanting once:
The Great Dao pervades the subtle and mysterious,
The lofty void encompasses the Three Wheels.
Golden transcendents open the numinous fan,
Resplendent as the Nine Heavens divided.
Patterned splendor scatters from the Purple Palace,
Eight Perfected shine upon the plain clouds.
The Mysterious Mother binds the supreme vow,
The eight gates lie between the ranks.
Myriad blessings converge in the numinous assembly,
Incense smoke rises as the Lower Origin is sung.
Wondrous recitation moves the layered void,
Attaining union with the exalted transcendent host.
Circumambulating, bow to the empty cavern,
Kowtow to the Lord Emperor.

Then exit through the southeastern earth gate to ascend the altar and perform the ritual of transmission:
Once the overnight exposure is complete, perform the rite again at dawn.
If wind or rain arises at daybreak, as the scripture says, perform it within the chamber.

Master and disciples together proceed to the northwestern Heavenly Gate,
Strike the teeth thirty-two times,
Visualize purple qi covering the altar and crown,
A hundred thousand divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs come to welcome the disciple’s body.
Then secretly invoke:
Divine perfected emerge on their journey,
Myriad thearchs are startled and alarmed.
Jade Void’s mysterious guards,
Celestial lodgings overturn.
Officials of the Five Marchmounts,
All assist with numinous power.
Commanding the ten directions,
Driving and dispatching heavenly soldiers.
From the heavens downward,
All assemble at the imperial court.
Grant that I ascend as transcendent,
Thoroughly attain the essence of the Dao,
Discern what is inauspicious,
Penetrate the obscure, fathom the hidden.
Wherever I turn, whatever I declare,
All accord with the Jade Clarity.

Next, enter the altar, face east,
Strike the teeth thirty-six times,
Perform the incense-burning invocation:
Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Most High Dao Lord,
Summon forth from our bodies
The void-and-spontaneous flying transcendent messengers,
Divine transcendent envoys,
Left and right flying dragons, great perfected,
Jade maidens, Five Thearchs’ direct talismans—
Thirty-six each—
To notify the true officials and numinous spirits of this land,
That as we now burn incense and transmit scriptures,
Our petition swiftly ascend,
Directly to the august presence of the Boundless Jade Emperor,
Before the lofty and perfected myriad sages.

Next, face north,
Strike the teeth thirty-six times,
Recite the demon-subduing invocation:
Heavenly demons surge through the void,
Myriad spirits startle the divine court.
Assuming transformations, they chant deceptive verses,
Shifting forms to enter namelessness.
Clamorous qi—how chaotic!
Defiled ways arise along the path.
Within clouds lies the Crimson Palace,
The Northern Thearch’s valiant divine soldiers.
The drum’s resonance knows itself,
The mysterious movement comes to summon them.
Upper luminaries feast with flying reins,
Swift chariots inspect the cloud camps.
Hastening to consult the Northern Thearch’s register,
Seizing and capturing the names of the demonic hordes.
The Fallen Ones spread the celestial net,
Unleashing power, casting flowing bells.
Golden perfected capture the empty cavern,
Jade radiance illuminates the eight darknesses.
Golden mystery guards the upper palace,
Divine tigers slay celestial spirits.
Severing and extinguishing the myriad demonic qi,
Countless billions are all pacified.
Receiving the trust of the Nine Heavens,
Whistling commands, none dare disobey.
Summoning the perfected, exploring the Three Caverns,
Wisdom recitation shines at dawn’s clarity.
Gazing at the eight ways of the mysterious rosy clouds,
Seven revolutions weave the heavenly scriptures.
Merging with the Thearch’s singular truth,
Delivering the seven generations of ancestors.
Eradicating the roots of the five sufferings,
Returning souls to receive glory anew.
Golden light illumines the silent chamber,
Divine candles spontaneously ignite.
Floral incense scatters through the jade script,
Smoke and qi penetrate the Jade Capital.
The Thearch dispatches the lingering chariot,
Three Origins descend in green wheels.
Swift chariots ascend the Nine Mysteries,
Attending our Jade Emperor’s court.

Next, bow nine times toward the upper direction as before.

Next, kneel lengthwise, strike the teeth nine times, and petition:
I now transmit to disciples [Name] and others
The precious scriptures of the Nine Heavens, the supreme jade-hidden clarity of the lofty constellation,
To present qi and command the union of perfected,
Praying that the Jade Transcendents who oversee truth,
The Registrar Attendants,
The Guardian Marshal of Numinous Might,
Descend to witness the covenant writ,
That all we reveal and entrust
May assuredly ascend.
Next, face the lower direction, bow twice, kneel, and again petition:
Highest Primordial Origin Heaven,
We now present our vows on this auspicious day of the Eight Assemblies,
Pure and reverent at the numinous...

The *Supreme Mystery Essentials*, Scroll Forty, concludes.
**Scroll Forty-One: The Staff-Brandishing Chapter, the Tablet-Brandishing Chapter, the Petition-Tablet Chapter, the Memorial-Tablet Text Chapter**

**The Staff-Brandishing Chapter**
From the *Upper Scripture of Jade Secrets of the Cavernous Mystery*:

The Primordial Five Elders emerge,
The Five Thearchs’ true talismans,
To deliver the people of the Five Thearchs.
The Celestial Radiance opens the Yang-light, revealing this text,
From the Mysterious Capital Palace.

The Primordial Azure Thearch’s true talisman summons the Direct Talisman Officer Gengsheng to guard the Celestial Writs of Numinous Treasure.
When the Daoist ingests it, numinous *qi* stabilizes the liver,
Generating nine petals of azure essence’s precious blossom.
Spirits are commanded as servants,
Enabling communion with the numinous to attain transcendence.

The above *Primordial Celestial Radiance Text* derives from the *Azure Thearch’s True Writ Chapter*,
To pacify the Nine *Qi* Heavens of the eastern direction.
The Azure Thearch receives this text to guard the Eastern Marchmount,
Sealing one passage to the Nine Numinous Cavern Chamber,
Which opens once every forty thousand kalpas.
Daoists whose destiny belongs to the Eastern Marchmount
Should inscribe azure talismans on crimson silk and wear them on the body.
They must also inscribe azure talismans on crimson silk,
Place them within the uppermost node of the spirit staff,
Clothe it in divine robes,
And have nine Jade Maidens of Azure Waist attend as guardians,
Lest they fail in reverence and incur the scrutiny of inspecting officers.

The Primordial Vermilion Thearch’s true talisman summons the Direct Talisman Officer Changzhong to guard the Celestial Writs of Numinous Treasure.
When the Daoist ingests it, numinous *qi* stabilizes the heart,
Generating three petals of cinnabar essence’s precious blossom.
Spirits are commanded as servants,
Enabling communion with the numinous to attain transcendence.

The above *Yang Brightness Text* derives from the *Vermilion Thearch’s True Writ Chapter*,
To pacify the Three *Qi* Heavens of the southern direction.
The Vermilion Thearch receives this text to guard the Southern Marchmount,
Sealing one passage to the Southern Huo Peak’s slopes,
Which opens once every forty thousand kalpas.
Daoists whose destiny belongs to the Southern Marchmount
Should inscribe vermilion talismans on yellow silk and wear them on the body.
They must also inscribe vermilion talismans on yellow silk,
Place them within the node below the Azure Thearch’s on the spirit staff,
And have three Jade Maidens of Great Cinnabar attend as guardians,
Lest they fail in reverence and incur the scrutiny of inspecting officers.

The Primordial Yellow Thearch’s true talisman summons the Four Directions’ Direct Talisman Officers to guard the Celestial Writs of Numinous Treasure,
With no central regular officer.
When the Daoist ingests it, numinous *qi* stabilizes the spleen,
Generating twelve petals of yellow essence’s precious blossom.
Spirits are commanded as servants,
Enabling communion with the numinous to attain transcendence.

The above *Comprehensive Numinous Text* derives from the *Yellow Thearch’s True Writ Chapter*,
To pacify the Five *Qi* Heavens of the central direction.
The Yellow Thearch receives this text as the celestial *qi* opens at the center,
Its revolutions responding to the turning wheel.
When this text first appears, the Celestial Gate halts its wheel,
And day and night cease to alternate.
The Primordial One gathers the original text,
Returning it to the *qi* of the Upper Primordium.
Thus, the Central Marchmount lacks this text.
It is recorded in the old scriptures only to preserve it from extinction.
The Four Thearchs jointly oversee its guardianship in the Upper Palace,
With no regular officer to guard it.
Daoists whose destiny belongs to the Central Marchmount
May inscribe yellow talismans on white silk and wear them on the body.
They must also inscribe yellow talismans on white silk,
Place them within the node below the Vermilion Thearch’s on the spirit staff.
The reason Daoists alone may wear this text
Is solely because the Yellow Thearch presides as host,
Aligning with the celestial *qi*.
Though it lacks a guardian officer,
Lest they fail in reverence and incur the scrutiny of inspecting officers.

The Primordial White Thearch’s true talisman summons the Direct Talisman Officer Quzheng to guard the Celestial Writs of Numinous Treasure.
When the Daoist ingests it, numinous *qi* stabilizes the lungs,
Generating seven petals of white essence’s precious blossom.
Spirits are commanded as servants,
Enabling communion with the numinous to attain transcendence.

The above *Radiant Primordial Numinous Text* derives from the *White Thearch’s True Writ Chapter*,
To pacify the Seven *Qi* Heavens of the western direction.
The White Thearch receives this text to guard the Western Marchmount,
Sealing one passage to the Nine Armpits Cavern Mouth of the Metal Cave,
Which opens once every forty thousand kalpas.
Daoists whose destiny belongs to the Western Marchmount
Should inscribe white talismans on *qi*-colored silk and wear them on the body.
They must also inscribe white talismans on *qi*-colored silk,
Place them within the node below the Yellow Thearch’s on the spirit staff,
And have seven Jade Maidens of Great Simplicity attend as guardians,
Lest they fail in reverence and incur the scrutiny of inspecting officers.

The Primordial *Qi* Thearch’s true talisman summons the Direct Talisman Officer Yin Feng to guard the Celestial Writs of Numinous Treasure.
When the Daoist ingests it, numinous *qi* stabilizes the kidneys,
Generating five petals of *qi* essence’s precious blossom.
Spirits are commanded as servants,
Enabling communion with the numinous to attain transcendence.

The above *Luminous Pervasion Text* derives from the *Black Thearch’s True Writ Chapter*,
To pacify the Five *Qi* Heavens of the northern direction.
The Dark Thearch receives this text to guard the Northern Marchmount,
Sealing one passage to the Dark Yin Cavern Chamber,
Which opens once every forty thousand kalpas.
Daoists whose destiny belongs to the Northern Marchmount
Should inscribe *qi* talismans on azure silk and wear them on the body.
They must also inscribe black talismans on azure silk,
Place them within the node below the White Thearch’s on the spirit staff,
And have five Jade Maidens of Great Mystery attend as guardians,
Lest they fail in reverence and incur the scrutiny of inspecting officers.

The Five Thearchs’ true talismans:
Their upper essence in heaven becomes the Five Stars,
Their middle essence in the human body becomes the Five Viscera,
Their lower essence on earth becomes the Five Marchmounts.
Thus, the fishes of the Three Primordia each have their respective affiliations.
Without the Five Writs in heaven, the Three Luminaries remain dim;
Without the Five Writs in humans, there is no means to establish form;
Without the Five Writs on earth, the Five Marchmounts lose their numinosity.
The Five Thearchs’ true talismans,
Born together with the Primordial One,
Are now concealed in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mysterious Capital.
Five hundred million divine officers attend the Five Thearchs,
And all heavens pay homage thrice monthly.
The true writs are guarded by fire, water, yin-yang officials,
And their disclosure is strictly forbidden.
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy seals them within the spirit staff,
Which must always accompany the body.
This is to conceal and repay the celestial perfected,
Never to be parted from the form even for a moment.

The Primordial spirit staff is made from seven-node bamboo of the Celestial Yang of Mount Ling,
With the five talismans placed in sequence at the center,
Leaving one node empty above and one below,
To correspond to the celestial and terrestrial configurations.
One should select sun-facing bamboo from Mount Ling,
Seven feet in length with seven nodes,
To fashion the spirit staff,
Ensuring the upper and lower sections are straight and unobstructed—sweet bamboo is best.
Inscribe the Black Thearch’s talisman within the second node from the bottom,
The White Thearch’s talisman in the third node,
The Yellow Thearch’s talisman in the fourth node,
The Vermilion Thearch’s talisman in the fifth node,
And the Azure Thearch’s talisman in the sixth node.
Leave the top node empty to connect with heaven,
And the bottom node empty to stand upon earth.
Seal the top node with wax and impress it with the Primordial One’s seal,
Seal the bottom node with wax and impress it with the Five Thearchs’ seal.
Wrap the talismans in crimson silk,
Ensuring the length and width are sufficient to encase the staff.

Carry it with you always—whether lying down, resting, sitting, or rising. When traveling, you may remove the staff from its wrapping to conceal your comings and goings, but always store it in a clean place when setting it aside. Point the staff toward heaven, and the celestial spirits will render homage; point it toward earth, and the terrestrial deities will receive you. Point it toward the northeast, and the myriad ghosts will be bound in form.

When riding the staff in motion or preparing to employ it, strike the teeth thirty-six times in succession. Visualize the five lictors of the Five Thearchs, each clad in the color of their respective direction, their five-colored radiance flowing and illuminating the staff. The jade maidens of the Five Thearchs, one for each, stand together to guard the staff on either side. Whisper the incantation:

"Mountain of the Great Yang,
Primordial essence of the Highest Origin.
Opening heaven, unfurling earth,
Sweet bamboo channels the numinous.
Lictors of the straight talismans, marshaling divine soldiers,
Five hues flow and gleam—vermilion fire, golden bells.
Assisting the perfected on high,
Emerging from darkness, entering the unseen.
Summon the heavens, and the heavens bow;
Command the earth, and the earth welcomes.
Point at ghosts, and ghosts perish;
Demons and malevolent spirits are bound in form.
Numinous talismans, divine staff,
Might to govern the hundred directions.
With me they attain completion,
With me they attain life.
After ten thousand kalpas,
They shall take my place in form.
Their splendor dissolves the Five Bonds,
Their spirits ascend to the Highest Clarity.
By talisman and decree,
None dare disobey."

Conclude by drawing in the qi of the five directions, reversing the flow twenty-five times, then cease.

Practice this Way for nine years with utmost diligence and reverence, and the divine perfected will manifest in form. The staff will then bear you aloft, soaring through the void. Should you seek liberation through the corpse, the staff will assume your form, and in an instant, you shall become a perfected one.

On the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, your natal day, and the eight solar terms, burn incense to either side and prostrate before the staff. Thus will the numinous spirits descend in response, and the Way will be accomplished.

*From the* **Upper Scripture of the Jade Instructions of the Cavernous Mystery**, *Section on the Tablet of Strategies.*

Inscribe in cinnabar the *Three Heavens Supreme Venerable Summons to Subdue Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, and Mountain Spirits* upon a gold tablet. Record also the year, month, and the master’s surname and personal name on another tablet. Enclose both tablets within a pouch, then inscribe in cinnabar the sequential text upon a third tablet, placing it on the outside of the pouch. Seal the three tablets together in the form of a divine tally, all made of *yin* wood, each one foot and four inches in length and two inches and four *fen* in width. Fashion a pouch from crimson silk, twelve feet in length, to wrap the sealed tablets, binding both ends. Imprint upon it the seal of the Primordial Five Elders of the Middle Origin. Encase the tally in a cypress box lined with crimson silk, and store it in a separate chamber. Burn incense on either side, offering reverent devotion. Once received, wear it upon the body, and all divine spirits under heaven will announce their names at the celestial gate. Twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens of the Five Emperors shall be assigned to you, accompanying your ingress and egress, with the Five Emperors as your guards. The administrators of the Three Realms shall receive you, and in life and death, you shall no longer face the three evil destinies. Bypassing Mount Tai, you shall ascend directly to the Nine Heavens, where clothing and sustenance arise spontaneously. Your rank shall equal that of the Supreme Ultimate, and you shall attain immortality as a matter of course.

When a Daoist adept who has received this teaching wears this text and performs the divine incantations, pointing the tally toward heaven will summon celestial spirits to descend; pointing it toward earth will cause earthly deities to prostrate in homage, with the Three Realms girding their sashes in attendance. Pointing it at spirits will make them bow in reverence; pointing it at ghosts will cause them to perish and dissipate. Pointing it at water will make the water spirits clear the way. Even when the great kalpa turns and the four floods converge in cataclysm, the tally may be used to summon dragons to bear you aloft. Through long cultivation and accumulated resonance, divine spirits will gather in response. Wherever you issue the summons, they shall arrive at once, manifesting myriad wonders as you will. In your comings and goings, your rank shall be commensurate with the Supreme Ultimate, ever preceded by flying dragons and followed by the celestial hook, with phoenixes crying and simurghs singing. Twelve radiant blossoms of light shall appear, and banners of the Three-Seven Colored Numinous Command shall be raised. After nine years of concentrated practice, the celestial regalia shall assemble of its own accord.

The *Eight Mighty Divine Incantations of the Numinous Treasure* state:

Primordial Supreme Perfected,
Five Spirits Most Exalted.
Radiant as the Great Flower,
Illuminating the Eight Gates.
The Five Elders issue their decree,
No hidden realm remains unopened.
Above, they govern the Nine Heavens;
At center, they command Mount Feng;
Below, they rule the rivers and seas,
The twelve sources of all waters.
The Eight Mighty Divine Incantations,
The Numinous Tally and Jade Texts.
Summon dragons to bear the waters,
Gather qi and amass the clouds.
Bind demons and dispatch ghosts,
Sweep away all demonic hordes.
Ten thousand spirits shall be shattered,
None shall escape the execution.
Sun and moon, the Five Stars,
The Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins.
All heavens, all earths,
All waters, all mountains,
The Jade Perfected’s hosts,
The Great Spirits of the Netherworld.
The Immortal Kings at their feasts,
The Five Emperors with their banners.
Celestial soldiers lead the way,
Golden tigers rush behind.
Fierce beasts of the highest heaven
Guard the four gates.
What is called shall arrive at once,
What is summoned shall appear before you.
The Vermilion Script blazes forth,
Wind and fire unceasing.
Whatever is seized or verified
Is transmitted by golden dragons.
Conclude by knocking the teeth nine times, inhaling toward heaven thrice, drawing in the celestial qi three times, and pointing the tally staff toward the designated place. Hold the breath for nine cycles, then cease.

*From the* **Scripture of the Azure Essence and Purple Writ of the Golden Root of the Cavernous Perfection**, *Section on the Casting of Tallies.*

The Most Exalted Azure Youth Lord said: None among the later sagely hosts of perfected beings fail first to present the golden tally to the Eastern Florescence or cast the jade writ to the Supreme Clarity before they may receive the *Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*, refine themselves through rigorous purification, and ascend as perfected persons. Yet those of shallow learning, lacking the golden tally’s register in the Azure Palace and the jade ledger’s mystic inscription, may neither unroll the divine scriptures nor command the celestial demons to be gathered. The true numina shall never descend, nor shall jade maidens guard their bodies.

Now, in accordance with the statutes of the Supreme August, I have compiled and arranged these ranks to serve as a gateway for later learners. Those of sincere heart should intensify their pure fasts, rouse their resolve with diligence, and fix their thoughts upon the mysterious truth, moving the Jade Emperor to respond. Once the golden tally is presented to the Azure Palace, they may recite the divine scriptures, penetrate the hidden depths, and the Most High shall dispatch the cinnabar chariot of flying wheels to welcome their forms, ascending to the Jade Clarity.

Yet this prohibition is most weighty—it is not transmitted to the untrue. The Most High regularly dispatches the Jade Dawn Primordial August Supreme Perfection Perfected One, leading the Immortal Jade Lords, to the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace on the first day of the first month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month—three times yearly—to review and confirm the registers of perfected immortals. Those whose names are inscribed on golden tallies and jade ledgers shall be reported to the Three Origins, and according to the depth of their cultivation, jade youths and jade maidens shall guard their bodies. Should any divulge these secrets, slight the true teachings, or treat the laws with disdain, the jade youths shall report them. Even those with golden tallies shall be struck from the rolls, their names transferred to the offices of ghosts, their bodies subjected to the trials of the wind-blade, their seven dark ancestors burdened with the stones of Mount Meng to fill the River of Eternal Night.

All who pursue this study must, on these appointed days, calm their minds in a secluded chamber, burn pure incense, and meditate in stillness. Scatter incense to left and right, inscribe the golden tally eight times in vermilion, bind it with purple cords, and present it to the Most High Jade Emperor of the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace. Prepare eight jade writs to present to the Three Origins. First, within the oratory, face east, knock the teeth nine times, and perform one cycle of praise and obeisance.

Thereafter, reverently address the Most High Supreme Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones:

*"This humble mountain adept, [Name], born in the [Month] of [Year], on the [Day] of the [Month] of [Year], at the [Hour] of the [Day], presents the golden tally, purple register, and jade ledger, submitting this text to the Most High Supreme Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, and the Twenty-Four Exalted Perfected Ones, to the golden tally’s purple radiance and the jade splendor of the numinous palace."*

Inscribe this in purple script, one foot in length, and attach it to the golden tally before casting it. Address it to the Most High Void August Jade Clarity Perfected One of the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace, [Name], who bows twice in reverence.

Inscribe this on one tally and present it.

The petition reads:

Dwelling in the forests and hills, sheltered beneath the sacred peaks, I reverently follow the mysterious statutes and present this golden tally, inscribing my name in the Upper Palace, beseeching to be granted enrollment in the highest register. May the perfected divinities of the Jade Clarity descend, allowing me to depart the lower world, ascend to the Golden Portal, and proceed to pay homage before the Jade Emperor.

Respectfully submitted.

Eight golden tallies in total, bound with purple cord.

Facing east, read the tally once through.

Completed, reverently submit.

The Most High Jade Treasure of the Great Clarity, Supreme Minister of the Golden Portals, Venerable Master Gaochen of the Eastern Sea, Azure Lad of the East—[Name] B, by fortunate karmic affinity and ancestral blessings, has been graced as a descendant of the lineage. Through the perfection bestowed by the true master, I have received the supreme scripture. Reverently I present the golden tablets, inscribing my name in the Azure Palace, beseeching to be recorded and entrusted to the Jade Youth. May this be universally proclaimed to all heavens and earths, the Perfected of the Caverns of Clarity, Depth, and Origin, and the host of immortals of the Five Peaks. May all witness this distinction, descend with true numen, and ascend upon flying auroras to the Three Clarities.

Completed, I rise and bow twice.

After presenting the tablets on three sides, I turn again to face east, click my teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:

The primal net extends into the distant,
The celestial perfected dwell in the hidden.
By ancestral blessings received,
Fortune graces even the unborn.
Once bound to the true master,
I was admonished and granted the precious scripture.
Dare I announce to the Three Origins,
And present my petition to the Jade Clarity.
Inscribed in gold at Eastern Florescence,
My name is recorded in the register.
Ever to be an imperial servant,
I pray for the descent of true numen,
Bestowed with jade lads and jade maidens to guard my form,
That I may ride the flying clouds,
Ascend to the Golden Portals,
And bow before the Jade Court.

Completed, I raise my head and swallow the fluid nine times, then cease.

All rites concluded, I bury the tablets at the peak to which I belong.
The *Jade Emperor’s Tablet* is placed to the north,
The *Three Origins’ Tablet* to the west,
The *Azure Palace Tablet* to the east,
Buried three feet deep, firmly packed above.

Completed, I face north, prostrate upon the earth, and click my teeth nine times.
Again I recite the incantation:

My name is presented to the Jade Register,
Inscribed in the script of the Upper Clarity.
Golden tablets and jade writs,
Bound into volumes at the imperial court.
Lofty and distant, the Three Origins dwell in the hidden.
Before the descent of the true officials,
I reverently seal the numinous peak,
Recording and presenting to the Three Clarities.
Listed in Eastern Florescence,
My jade name is inscribed.
May I ascend by the mysterious lift,
Ride the flying auroras in emerald chariots,
Reach the Three Origins,
And soar to the imperial dawn.

Completed, I rise and bow twice.

The method of presenting tablets to seek immortality, as received by the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning from the Most High, requires three presentations of tablets and writs. Within nine years, the Jade Emperor shall bestow cinnabar essence, jade mushrooms, golden seals, and phoenix script. The Perfected of the Great Ultimate shall descend to your chamber, and the Three Origins shall dispatch thirty-six jade lads and jade maidens. The Supreme Minister Azure Lad shall proclaim to the Five Peaks, bestowing the canopy of flying auroras and an immortal’s parasol, to welcome your form and ascend to the palace of the Golden Portals.

The Perfected Lord of Numinous Treasure, [Name], born in the [such-and-such] year, aged [such-and-such] as in the thousand-year cycle, in the [such-and-such] month—wishing for divine transcendence, to become an immortal, and attain eternal life without death. May the Three Origins be preserved as one, the Water Emperors of the Nine Palaces, the Twelve River Sources, the Jiang, the seas, the Huai, the marshes, and the great spirits of the vast and cold. I beseech the erasure of my sinful name, to be heard in the Nine Heavens, and to journey to the Water Palace by golden dragon courier.

On the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month in the [such-and-such] year, [Name] presents this document in the [such-and-such] kingdom.

Inscribe this in vermilion upon the register-tablet, wrap the tablet in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, and let a golden dragon bear the tablet to be cast into the abyss of the Three Rivers. Initially, use nine golden clasps to fasten the tablets before sinking them. For subsequent castings, this is not required. Perform the rite three times in total.

When casting the tablet, choose a clear and cold abyss. Face north, click the teeth three times, read the document to its end, and recite the incantation:

Primordial Beginning and the Five Elders,
Supreme Lords of the Highest,
Perfected of the Ten Directions,
Divine immortals of Great Florescence.
The vermilion script proclaims the decree,
No hidden realm remains uninformed.
Ascending to govern the Nine Heavens,
I humbly present this document below.
Sun, moon, and the Five Stars,
The Northern Dipper and the Seven Origins.
Announce to the Five Peaks,
The numinous mountains of the four directions.
Proclaim to the rivers and seas,
The Twelve Water Sources,
The Water Emperors of the Nine Palaces,
And the great spirits of the true numen.
Today I make this supreme announcement,
Declaring all my wishes.
I present the jade tablet,
Beseeching the erasure of my sinful name,
My thousand ancestors and ten thousand forebears,
The nine clans and all kin.
Sinful names that have stained me,
May all be erased and their roots severed.
Record my name in the Water Palace,
Announced before the Supreme Emperor.
May my seven generations of ancestors,
Depart from the Eight Difficulties,
Ascend to the Nine Heavens,
And be clothed and fed by nature.
My sins released and dispersed,
May all spirits hear.
I pledge with golden clasps,
To ally with the water officials.
As I have declared,
Let the golden dragon courier transmit.

Wishing for divine transcendence, to become an immortal, to attain eternal life and transcend the world, to soar and ascend to the Upper Clarity.

Inscribe this in vermilion upon a silver tablet, wrap it in blue paper, bind it with blue silk. Use nine golden clasps and one golden dragon, and bury it at the peak of one’s life-destiny. Face east, click the teeth nine times, read the tablet to its end, and recite the incantation:

The mysterious and luminous opens,
The Primordial Beginning oversees the true.
The Five Elders of the Supreme Emperor,
The vermilion script of the red writ.
The origin of heaven and earth,
Governor of the Three Origins.
Commanding qi and summoning assemblies,

Their souls ascend to the Nine Heavens.
Life and death transcended,

To ally with the true officials.
As I have declared,

Wishing for divine transcendence, to become an immortal, to attain eternal life and transcend the world, to soar and ascend to the Upper Clarity, the Central August of the Nine Earths. O Yellow Spirits of Wu and Ji, the Five Emperors of the Earth Palace, I beseech the erasure of my sinful register, to be inscribed in the Great Mystery.

Transformed in the immortal courts.
Auspicious day, this decree is issued,
The ten thousand kinds heed its command.

As this petition is transmitted by golden dragon courier.

*From The Highest Origin Numinous Treasure Supreme Method for Petitioning the Earth Sovereign of the Nine Lands to Erase Sins, Declare One’s Name, and Seek Immortality*
Thus concludes Scroll Forty-One of *The Supreme Essentials*
Scroll Forty-Two of *The Supreme Essentials* begins

**Chapter on Serving the Master**

When approaching the master with a request or to inquire about the Dao, one must first bow once to the *Scripture Master* and once to the *Register Master*. After this, bow twice more. Then, address the *Initiation Master* and state one’s purpose.

When visiting the master, one should fast and purify oneself from the previous night, don proper ritual attire, and await dawn with reverence, filled with both urgency and joy. One’s conduct must be upright, bowing deeply with measured movements, demeanor composed as though standing before the divine. Each step toward the master should be taken with hands clasped and feet together, mind fixed upon the Perfected Ones above.

Approach the master with wholehearted reverence, hands respectfully gathered, gaze steady, and thoughts clearly focused. Maintain a centered mind, intent upon the mysterious and void, performing rites with solemnity and measured movements.

In bowing and yielding to the master, honor the non-action of the Dao, rejoicing in the void, where joy and felicity converge. Before approaching, wash hands and feet, wear clean and plain garments, and anoint the body with fragrance so that one’s *qi* harmonizes with the divine radiance.

After exchanging greetings with the master, enter the purification hall, burn incense, make vows, and pay homage to the Three Treasures. Adjust one’s ritual attire, arrange oneself properly, and listen with focused attention, responding both inwardly and outwardly with care.

Joy and reverence should fill one’s heart, countenance upright, gaze direct, awe and caution ever-present, as though treading upon thin ice. When seated beside the master, maintain composure without fault, observed by all.

After completing the rites, reflect upon one’s past transgressions in this life and resolve to reform. Once this reflection is complete, still the mind and abide in clarity, holding the divine *qi* within, never straying from it.

After all contemplations, rise to sweep and purify the inner and outer spaces, offering service and devotion in reverent observance. When prostrating before the master to present a request, rise to perform the rites, then return to one’s seat to state one’s purpose.

Speak with a calm and gentle voice, exhaling and inhaling softly, never raising it harshly to harm one’s true *qi*. Choose words carefully, speaking in accordance with the Dao’s intent, never carelessly or with personal bias.

Proceed directly and without deviation, never wandering or wavering in resolve. Seek the true Dao with sincerity, never harboring divided loyalties. Keep heart and speech pure, focused upon the true and real, never consuming alcohol to cloud the divine *qi*.

Uphold the precepts with discipline, unwavering even unto death, never indulging in stray thoughts or worldly distractions. Let one’s *qi* and form be in harmony, never gathering those of disparate kinds.

When resting or sleeping in the master’s presence, remain clothed, thoughts fixed upon the true, never exposing the body. Keep one’s headdress and attire always tidy, never bareheaded, lest one show disrespect to the honored.

Rejoice in the master’s presence as though before a great sage, never giving way to anger or resentment. Cultivate loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, never acting with jealousy or harboring unrighteousness.

Conceal the unworthy and proclaim the good, ever promoting the Four Classes, never slandering or suppressing the worthy. Strive to enlighten and liberate all beings, never obstructing or stifling the stubborn.

Awaken the ignorant and guide them into the Dao’s gate, never obscuring the truth or deceiving the true for personal gain. Reflect upon the universal vision of the Dao’s gate, never entertaining wayward thoughts or straying onto crooked paths.

Hold the master’s household in mind, that all may attain flight and ascension, one’s own body serving and ascending to the great sages. If the master is grieved, disciples must share in that sorrow, showing no joy in their comings and goings.

If the master falls ill, disciples must attend closely, observing their breath as though caring for their own parents. If the master faces misfortune, disciples must gather fellow students to establish purification rites and prayers, accumulating merit.

When parting from the master for months or years, disciples must don ritual attire, hold the tablet, bow three times, and kneel to inquire after them. After this, bow twice more, completing five bows. The same is observed upon reunion.

Remember this well—never neglect these observances, lest one be deemed irreverent. When disciples travel or lodge away, they must bow twice and kneel upon parting and returning.

Those who share the same surname, lineage, or ancestral rites in mourning garments may not serve as master and disciple. This is because on the day of initiation, the three generations of grandparents, five generations of ancestors, and seven generations of parents come to witness their descendants’ reception of the Dao. Should one violate their oath, the nine generations will bear the sin, bringing calamity upon the recipient of the Dao’s body—thus, they may not serve as disciples.

In all actions, whether entering or departing, one must first consult and inform the master, never acting arbitrarily or self-indulgently. When walking with the master, never step upon their shadow. When seated with the master, never accept another’s kneeling bows, for there is no second honor in a seat.

When sharing a room with the master, if they rise, move, or depart, disciples must rise and step down, never remaining seated in their presence. Upon first approaching the master to receive the Dao’s teachings, one must wear ritual attire, hold the tablet, and humbly seek instruction, never carelessly or presumptuously speaking.

When presenting the master’s writings, place them upon the table, burn incense, bow twice, then open and read them, reciting each phrase aloud. Afterward, bow twice more and return the writings to the master. The same is observed when responding to the master’s letters.

Disciples must never violate the master’s name or taboo. If asked about the master’s name, and pressed thrice, one must bite the teeth in restraint. Disciples must never touch or disturb the master’s attendants, for officials oversee their conduct.

*From The Scripture of the Golden Register of the Cavernous Mystery, Chapter on Cultivating Study*

The Most High said: In all learning, one must proceed from the lower to the higher, cultivating in proper sequence, never skipping or omitting, lest one violate the celestial statutes and ordinances.

The scriptures comprise three ranks, and the Dao possesses three Perfected Ones. The Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns, the Celestial Script of Great Characters, the Registers of the Nine Heavens, and the Way of the Yellow and White—these allow one to rein the reins of the Dark Empyrean and traverse the Five Marchmounts, thus constituting the first rank of the lower grade.

The Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure likewise originates with the Primordial Beginning. Its traces are profound and abstruse, its wondrous essence sharing a common source. With fragrant orchids of purification and fasting, the Five Invocations illumine the Mystery. It delivers the seven generations of ancestors and severs the roots of transgression, also causing Perfected Ones to descend and ascend in flight to the Upper Clarity. The marvels of the middle grade do not preclude earthly immortality.

The Daoist Scriptures of the Upper Clarity and the Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir—comprising three hundred treasured names and nine thousand jade instructions—are the foremost titles of the Upper Perfected Ones and the inner chapters of the Jade Emperor. Those who attain them are recorded on the Jade Tablets, their names inscribed in the Azure Palace, ascending at dawn to the Imperial Hall. These are the instructions of the upper grade.

The Most High said: In human learning, all begin with diligence but grow lax in the end, or falter when success is near, entirely due to having resolve that is not steadfast, or being steadfast yet not firm, thus failing to achieve the expected outcome. Heaven does not deceive humanity—it reveals itself through echoes; Earth does not betray humanity—it responds with shadows.

Where echoes and shadows do not reach, the spirits grow distant. Is this not because the celestial truth fails to manifest—all due to the self?

—Excerpted from *The Most High Cavern-Real Plain Numinous Great Possession Scripture*

Those who attain immortality do so through the learning of the heart, and through sincerity of heart; those who attain the Dao do so through inward seeking, and through inner secrecy—then the Dao draws near. Those who attain the Real do so through cultivating stillness and profound quietude—then they merge with the Real; those who attain the numinous do so through accumulated resonance and response—then the spirit becomes efficacious. Those who can constantly uphold these principles draw ever nearer to the day of transcendence.

Yet if the heart is contentious and the spirit startled, if the body is harmonious but the focus scattered, if movement and stillness dissipate essence, if the ears and eyes are overly keen—then even with ceaseless yearning and pursuit of the Dao, the Dao grows ever more distant. Methods of guiding and pulling, of ingesting qi, of embryonic breathing, of closing the heart and preserving thought—along with the esoteric scriptures of the Numinous Middle Chapters, the hidden tones of the Golden Casket, the inner and outer canons of the Yellow Court, and the guard-records of the Great Clarity—numbering several thousand such practices, all have circulated among the common folk, known and heard by all. Since the middle ages, from the time of the Yellow Emperor onward, those who have ascended and transcended by means of these teachings are as numerous as the mountains, beyond counting. Such individuals have exerted their hearts to the utmost, guarded their essence with devotion, held fast to their integrity, and steadied their aspirations. In practicing these four virtues, I shall break the bonds for you and grant you ascent to immortality.

As for those of unstable resolve who undertake these practices: some may toil for years, even decades, without gaining benefit. Why? Some fail to grasp the principles of ingesting qi and regulating breath; others are led astray by external distractions and fail when success is near; some gain temporary benefit but cease upon encountering illness; others receive instruction from their masters yet cannot discern its meaning; some cannot concentrate their minds, their spirits scattered and confused; others accumulate transgressions and offenses, violating celestial taboos; still others recklessly alter scriptural methods according to their own whims. Such cases are commonplace—these are the frivolous and defiled, those who utter empty words, unworthy of instruction. Thus the Great Dao is not disseminated throughout the world, and true immortals seldom wander among mortals—all due to humanity’s deep failings, not the fault of our fellowship.

—Excerpted from *The Most High Cavern-Real Hidden Writ Scripture*

The Perfected Lord Zhou said: Few are those born naturally attuned to the Way; rare are those who understand the Dao from birth. One must cultivate and practice it, study and refine it.

Laozi said: When superior individuals hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it. How true these words are!

—Excerpted from *The Cavern-Real Chamber-Interior Scripture*

The Three Sovereigns said: Those who wish to cultivate the Dao and share the lifespan of the Three Heavens must spurn extravagance and delight in frugality; scorn glory and honor, and find contentment in lowliness and humility; despise brocade and silk, and instead wear coarse cloth while cherishing the jade within.

Those who are not distressed by poverty and lowliness, nor zealous for power and emolument—this is the essence of extending life.

It is further said: For those who practice the Dao, retreat has its obstructions, and advance has its reasons. Like crows and egrets of different kinds, the clear and the turbid flow apart. No goodness is left unraised, no worthy left unpromoted. Heaven’s love never ceases, the spirits’ reverence never rests—this is the enduring path of Dao cultivation.

It is further said: The vast Three Heavens nurture all things together. Others covet the blossoms, while I take the fruit; others seek the ornament, while I receive the essence. With a tranquil mind and hidden stillness, free from the toil of household affairs—this is the way to prolong life.

It is further said: When the world is rigid, comply by softening the heart. Conceal your wings outwardly, withdraw your scales inwardly. Let glory not burden you, let favor not cling to your person. Hide your radiance and conceal your light, withdraw from the world and guard the Real. Preserve the brightness of your eyes, and turn your thoughts to the Five Spirits—this is the great essential for increasing years.

The Heavenly Elder said: When common people cultivate the Dao, their minds are filled with a thousand distractions. Their eyes see gaudy colors, their thoughts grow chaotic, their hearts troubled. The Five Spirits lose their master, and the Dao Lord does not return. Petty men practice for no more than a day or ten, claiming swift attainment, reciting with their mouths and grasping with their hands. Before gaining even a single text, they believe they can preserve their bodies whole. They see only the swift rush of a trickling stream, not the vast depth of rivers and seas. They perceive the fleeting profit of advancement, not the nourishment of the spirit through embracing the Dao.

The Yellow Emperor said: When one receives the Heavenly Writ of the Three Sovereigns, it is always inscribed with one’s predestined name in the Mysterious Register. Having received the divine script, one must practice its methods. First, one must aid and rescue the emperor, dispel calamities, and ensure the nation’s peace and the people’s security. Only then may one withdraw to seclusion and cultivate in tranquility.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern-Spirit Scripture of Overseeing the Heavens*

Cultivate it in the body, and its virtue becomes real;
Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;
Cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds;
Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.

Thus, observe the body through the body, the family through the family, the village through the village, the state through the state, the world through the world. How do I know the way of the world? By this.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of Laozi on Virtue*

When the Dao and virtue are cultivated in the body, the heart becomes penetrating and the will unimpeded. One values the spirit and cherishes qi, disdains material things and scorns fame. Thoughts are free from confusion, blood and qi harmonious. The skin is moist and lustrous, the face radiant. The spirit is focused and steadfast, the body light and strong. Void and full complement each other, the temples are glossy, and one’s appearance remains youthful without end.

When cultivated in the family, fathers are kind and children filial, husbands faithful and wives chaste, elder brothers considerate and younger brothers obedient. The nine clans live in harmonious kinship. Farming and sericulture proceed in season, blessings and abundance accumulate. The six livestock multiply, and undertakings flourish with constant surplus.

When cultivated in the village, actions accord with harmony and moderation. The proper norms and disciplines are observed. Right and wrong are clearly distinguished, crooked and straight follow different principles. Truth and falsehood are naturally discerned, treachery and deceit do not arise. Authority and dignity are esteemed. Superiors are served and inferiors transformed, as in a father-son relationship. Love, respect, trust, and devotion prevail. Superiors and subordinates are joyfully close, the hundred clans harmoniously gathered. Officials have no backlog of duties, their posts are well-managed, and their reputations honored. They remain secure until the end of their lives.

When cultivated in the state, the ruler is enlightened and ministers loyal. The court does not conceal the worthy, scholars do not envy merit. Evil does not obscure the upright, slander does not harm the public. Harmony and compliance prevail, superiors and subordinates bear no grudges. All officials are content, and all affairs proceed naturally. Distant peoples yearn and admire, the world follows the prevailing wind. The state is wealthy and the people prosperous. Though unprovoked, it grows strong. Ancestral temples are revered, the altars of soil and grain endure in peace. Yin and yang harmonize, calamities and disorders do not arise. The myriad things flourish, and within the borders, great tranquility reigns. Neighboring states entrust their fate, and future generations prosper. Dao and virtue abound, becoming as constant as Heaven.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of Wondrous Reality*

Though the Great Dao has no intent, it may be sought with feeling.
I stand my chariot in the empty void,
Gazing back at the hidden currents of the azure flow.
Beyond the Three Realms, pure and bright,
I wander the desolate Jade Capital.
Without the mysterious impetus of fate,
Who can comprehend the obscure subtleties?
The Milky Way shines clear and still,
As I look up and down in the softness of the void.
The Seven Mysteries scatter the dark night,
Returning to the womb, following the ebb and flow.
If one silently awaits the hidden convergence,
The Yang Nine brings no sorrow or care.
Beholding these comings and goings,
Time and again, one lingers.
By relinquishing the body, the body is preserved—
True immortals meet their true companions.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern-Mysterious Scripture of the Nine Heavens*

The Perfected said: For those who study the Dao, their conduct toward others should first be filial to their parents, loyal to their lord, compassionate to those they employ, kind to their friends, trustworthy and reliable, admonishing evil and praising good. Without partiality or self-interest, free from the bias of "I" and "mine," not violating external teachings—this is the ability to practice the human Dao.

Next, one must abstain from wine and meat, from sensual pleasures, jealousy, killing, extravagance, greed, arrogance, and indulgence.

Next, one must avoid the five pungent vegetables, which harm life and stimulate the palate.

Next, one must still all thoughts and perceptions, so the heart beholds the clear and void.

Next, one must practice grain avoidance, uphold the great precepts, maintain firm resolve and diligent aspiration, engage in guiding and embryonic breathing, exhale and inhale harmoniously, and cultivate merit and virtue.

The pursuit of immortal arts is urgent; uphold the precepts to restrain the heart. With emptiness and equanimity, the correct qi resides within, and immortals and sages naturally come seeking you.

If one does not believe these teachings, why dwell in the mountains and forests?
The great worthies delight in the scriptures and precepts,
Receiving them as treasures for the body.
Those who begin their studies always regret being late,
Those who cultivate themselves lament not starting sooner.
This is the time to uncover the hidden and abstruse,
Yet in a flash, the years have grown old.
Grasping the scrolls, you exhaust your efforts,
Only to face death with bitter remorse.
Thus, in my youth, I abandoned the world to study the Dao.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern-Mysterious Scripture of Settling the Aspiration*

Laozi said: One should hold to the source of superior wisdom, for wisdom does not arise alone. It must respond to conditions, each having its karmic roots from past conduct.

What is heard of destiny and fortune is shared by those on the same path, just as those of the same virtue have roots in virtue. Those who did not study in past lives now again drift apart from it. Thus, success and failure depend on this, and one should not delight solely in the texts of the Dao.

From the *Scripture of Western Ascension*:

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao said: The arts of internal alchemy governing the bedchamber, the benefits of the Yellow Way and Red Qi in union, the essentials of seven-nine morning refinement and seminal absorption, the methods of Six-One Reverted Elixir and yin-yang interplay—though these may confer the name of immortality, the Upper Clarity does not deem them comparable to virtue; though they may achieve transformation, the Most High does not hold them in esteem. These are the defiled immortals and turbid perfected ones, inherently unworthy to pass through the Jade Gate.

Moreover, treading treacherous ice is often seen to end in overturned chariots. Even those who survive intact remain but foul and disordered earthbound immortals.

From the *Supreme Cavern-Real Scripture of Wisdom and Dispelling Demons*:

The Pure Numinous Perfected One said: The Way of Yellow and Red, the method of mixed qi—these are but one technique taught by Zhang Daoling to propagate his lineage, not the work of true perfected ones. I have seen many who practiced this and perished without descendants, yet none who cultivated it and attained life. Among millions, all have been examined and found wanting. Among ten million, perhaps one may errantly succeed, achieving a distant semblance of deathlessness. Zhang Daoling transmitted this to teach the world, yet even his own transformations did not rely upon it. Beware the defiled ways of base existence, for they corrupt the upright qi of the True Empyrean. Those who harbor lustful desires, fix their minds on sensual visions, and yet claim to practice the supreme Way only clarify the penalties of the Three Palaces—like bearing jade into fire or interring a dog in a golden coffin. The "Yellow and Red" refers to sensual visions; the "supreme Way" to the Hidden Writ. How few comprehend this!

The Lady of Purple Tenuity said: The Yellow Writ and Red Realm, though secret essentials of long life, are but inferior arts of attaining existence, not to be spoken of by those who feast in the Upper Palace with the Heavenly Perfected. This Way lies merely in nurturing and generating life, not in the supreme Dao. Those who harbor lustful qi while practicing the Hidden Writ only shake the brush of the Three Officials, sound the drums of the Three Officials—even the Mysterious Staff cannot be relied upon, nor can liberation be trusted. In short: purity invites numinous descent; devotion commands spirit aid.

---

The Lady of Right Florescence said: Those who study the Dao must focus single-mindedly on the Dao and infuse the true, free from scattered thoughts. Cast off extravagance, preserve simplicity and purity. Be still as though secretly perceiving, rarefied as though subtly attaining. Tremble as if standing at a deep ravine, quake as if treading upon ice and embers. This is but the gate of attaining the Dao, not yet its inner chamber. What is called difficult is the study of the Dao; what is called easy is also the study of the Dao. In serene mystery and profound savor, preserve harmony with the Heavenly Perfected. Direct the spirit to nest in the numinous, immerse in the study of the Six Repositories. Cherish essence and seal the Gate of Earth, neither seeing nor hearing—this is the ease of the Dao. Those who cannot practice this find it difficult.

---

The Lady of Right Florescence said: From ancient times to the present, life and death have had their ford. Manifest and hidden meet differently; the past is concealed, wisdom extinguished. Those who align with the world in this share in the practice of attaining the Dao. As for those who refine the Jade Elixir once, soar thrice with the Nine Flowers, savor cloud-liquor at dawn, wander with flowing yellow, swallow golden nectar, and chew jade blossoms—they may instantly command the light and ascend to the void, rising to the Great Tenuity. Yet when worldly affairs diverge and karmic tasks remain unfinished, one must tread the path of the Great Yin, conceal life in the dark realm, relinquish the body and abandon form, nurture the embryo in the empty dwelling, refine qi and seal the crucible, receive essence in the mysterious vastness. Thus, one transforms countenance in the halls of the Three Yin, regains youth at the gates of the Nine Refinements. Only then does one know the marvel of divine immortality—death yet not perishing, the principle of going and coming runs deep.

---

The Lord of Life of the Eastern Minister said: For those who practice the Dao, essence is sufficient. With essence but no diligence, nothing can be achieved; with diligence but no focus, nothing can be accomplished. One must dissolve stinginess and scatter defilement. The Lord of Fixed Records said: To distance the inner and betray the heart is to lose the true nature of the Three Hun. Once the true is scattered, the hun seize the opening. Those who practice the Dao must make the inner heart as clear as a mirror, harmonizing the inner and outer like notes in resonance. The numinous responds within, the spirit descends without—this is no empty claim.

---

The Lady of Mysterious Clarity said: Practicing the Dao is like wood upon water: carried by the current, it neither strikes the left bank nor the right, is neither taken by men nor blocked by ghosts and spirits, nor does it rot. I guarantee it will reach the sea. If one practices the Dao without being deluded by defiled desires or deceived by manifold evils, advancing without doubt, I guarantee they will attain the Dao.

---

The Candidate of Fixed Records said: Those who practice the Dao should always wander alone in profound tranquility, nest the spirit in leisurely roaming, drink and peck in contentment, seek nothing from the snares of the world. Joy and sorrow thus depart forever, and the Gate of Early Death will have no way to approach. Each abides in their destined dwelling, each nature possesses its own harmony. How can one tread the crooked paths of things and distort one’s rightful work? Why not follow the utmost traces of Heaven’s banner, seek the inner joy of the true, follow seclusion to gladden the heart, grasp one’s refuge to settle the mind, dwell on Eastern Mountain to conceal one’s tracks, hold the mysterious snare on the wondrous peak, preserve the Sui Pearl to contain illumination, and dispel the Five Difficulties from the heart?

---

The Lord of Life said: Practicing the Dao should keep the Three Passes ever harmonized—this is the way to accumulate essence and strengthen the bones. The Three Passes are: the mouth as the Heavenly Pass, the feet as the Earthly Pass, and the hands as the Human Pass. When the Three Passes are harmonized, the Five Viscera are at peace, and the entire body remains free of illness.

---

The Lady of Purple Prime instructed: Practicing the Dao is like holding fire and entering a dark room—the darkness vanishes, and only light remains. Cultivating the Dao and preserving rectitude, ignorance dissipates, and rectitude endures.

---

The Most High questioned Daoling: How long does a person’s life last?
One replied: A matter of days.

The Most High said: You have not yet grasped the Dao.
One replied: A person’s life lies between eating and drinking.
The Most High said: You may leave; this is not the Dao.
Another replied: It lies between each breath.
The Most High said: Excellent! This may indeed be called the Dao. I once heard these words, and now I tell them to you. If you diligently study the Dao, you may yet transcend this breath. Though my disciples may be thousands of miles away, if their hearts hold fast to my precepts, they will surely attain the Dao. Those who delve deeply into the Jade Classics and treasure scriptures will attain immortality. As for those who stand at my left side, their intentions incline toward perverse conduct—they will never attain the Dao.

To practice the Dao through scripture and action is like tasting honey: the entire mouth is sweet, the six palaces are filled with delight, and a lingering savor remains. Those who can act thus have attained the Dao.

—From the *Zhen Gao*

The Perfected of Pure Numinosity, expounding the *Scripture of Treasured Spirits*, said: To fix the heart upon the true Dao and mystically contemplate the numinous ones in profound stillness is also to reflect upon one’s intent. If external obstacles have not yet been cast aside, and one clings to both the illusory and the real, they cannot reverse the years beneath the western elm nor restore the hair of the Mystic Youth. Yet if one is devoted to the profound with unwavering resolve, even if their teeth are carved with age, their face lined with wrinkles, and white blossoms sprout upon their crown, my Dao can transform them into an infant in but a moment. The question lies only in the strength of their resolve—age is no barrier to learning the Dao. I am such a person.

—From the *Scripture of Daoist Traces*

*Supreme Secret Essentials*, Scroll Forty-Two—End
*Supreme Secret Essentials*, Scroll Forty-Three
**On Daoist Robes and Headgear**
**The Three Sovereigns’ Ritual Attire for Daoist Adepts**

**From the *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns of the Cavernous Divine (Dongshen Sanhuang Jing)*:**
When the body of one who receives the Dao exchanges worldly garments, its adornments and designations become "ritual vestments." Some may wear robes of the three colors—mystic black, azure, and white—as prescribed, storing within them the *qi* of *jiazi*, *jiayin*, and *jiashen* to fortify the body’s form. A mystic black cap and black headscarf, an azure-green unlined robe, and straw sandals of white *mang* grass are called ritual vestments. When one attains the Dao and ascends to heaven, embroidered robes will come of their own accord.

For those who study all Three Caverns, coarse hempen skirts and unlined robes may be worn together, along with wooden clogs and headscarves, all permissible for use.

**Ritual Vestments of the Numinous Treasure Daoist**
*From the *True One Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery’s Natural Essentials (Dongxuan Zhenyi Ziran Jingjue)*:*
The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: When receiving the Dao and holding the scriptures, one wears ritual robes, headscarves, and hempen garments. The hempen robes should each be three feet and six inches long, with thirty-two seams. If deerhide is used for the headscarf and robe, it is most excellent; leather robes have no fixed number of seams. They are paired with yellow skirts. Straw sandals are worn on the feet, though leather shoes may also be used.

*From the *Hidden Commentaries on the Scripture of the Great Ultimate of the Cavernous Mystery (Dongxuan Taiji Yin Zhu Jing)*:*
The commentary states: When reciting scriptures while seated on a small dais, five feet in height and equal in length and breadth, one wears a deerhide headscarf and drapes a deerhide mantle, with no need for a hempen robe. If no hide is available, a cloth mantle may be used, along with straw sandals.

When the Perfected of the Great Ultimate reads the scriptures, their ritual vestments consist of a mantle woven from nine-light brocade of *li* silk, a headscarf of cinnabar-red *luo* silk adorned with jeweled radiance, and shoes embroidered with lion patterns. When a Daoist recites scriptures and toils diligently in ritual affairs, they wear a deerhide mantle. After attaining the Dao, the Heavenly Emperor bestows upon them a nine-light *li* silk mantle, celestial jeweled tassels, and the flying immortal’s ritual vestments as reward for their virtuous merit.

**From the *Lower Scroll of the Scripture of Questions to the Cavernous Mystery (Dongxuan Qingwen Jing Xia)*:**
Those who study the Dao must always keep their clothing pure and secluded, burn incense, arrange a high seat, display the scriptures, bow in reverence, concentrate the mind to visualize the Perfected, practice breath refinement and nurturing, repent for the transgressions of seven generations of parents as well as past and present heavy wrongs, perform acts of charity, establish merit, maintain long-term fasting and seclusion, and stabilize their original vows. Only when the heart is empty and the intent profound can the Dao be achieved.

One must properly prepare headscarves, hempen robes, unlined skirts, and recitation mantles. The ritual system forbids lending them to others or wearing them in impure places. Such are called "ritual vestments," and three divine youths always attend them. Once, a virtuous man invited a Daoist, but the Daoist could not go and instead sent his mantle and robe. Upon arriving at the man’s home, the man reverently burned incense and paid homage as if the Daoist were present. The divine youths appeared in visible form, saying: "The Daoist sent us." The host did not realize they were divine youths. Any illness in the household was immediately cured, and the family remained free of misfortune. The divine youths told the host: "The sick have recovered; the Daoist need not trouble himself to come. You may return the ritual vestments to him." The host followed their words and returned them to the Daoist.

The host asked: "Yesterday, I suffered greatly from illness and invited you to a feast. Though you were occupied with many affairs, you sent a messenger, yet you never came to visit. Now the sick have recovered, and I return your ritual vestments." The Daoist was astonished. After listening, he replied: "This poor Daoist had to complete a ritual before going, and the virtuous man did not come again. Thus, I did not go—it was not a breach of trust. I had no one to send, nor did I know your household’s illness had been cured. This must have been due to the host’s wholehearted devotion."

The Daoist asked: "What did the messenger look like?"
The host replied: "About fifteen or sixteen years old, with a dignified and handsome appearance, surpassing all others."
The Daoist pondered: "I have no disciples like that. It must have been a divine being." Thus, ritual vestments must always be kept pure and made according to proper methods. Otherwise, ghosts may harm people instead. If they become damaged, one must wear them oneself and not use them for other purposes.

**From the *Scripture of Ascending Mystery (Shengxuan Jing)*:**
There was an immortal named Dou Ziming who wore a yellow hempen robe and a mystic black headscarf. He bowed in reverence, circled the Most High seven times, and chanted praises.

**Ritual Vestments of the Highest Clarity Daoist**
*From the *Bright Regulations of the Four Poles of the Cavernous Perfection (Dongzhen Siji Mingke)*:*
When studying the thirty-nine chapters of the *Highest Clarity Scripture of the Great Cavern* and entering the chamber, one must wear ritual vestments: a headscarf of deerhide (or kudzu cloth), and a mantle of deerhide. If purple and azure are unavailable, purple may be used for the robe and azure for the lining. The mantle should be four feet and nine inches wide to correspond to the number of the four seasons, and five feet and five inches long to align with the *qi* of heaven and earth. The outer and inner layers follow the same method: the outer should have twenty-four seams, the lining fifteen, totaling thirty-nine seams inside and out to correspond to the positions of the thirty-nine Perfected Emperors, thus matching the imperial vestments of the crown and sash.

If one lacks these vestments, the precious scriptures must not be casually recited. A single chant will resound through the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Perfected will attend in their positions—such a response is not to be taken lightly. If one recites the scriptures in a single unlined robe, demonic forces will penetrate the Nine Heavens, myriad spirits will disrupt the sound, the spirit will perish, the *qi* will scatter, and one will die and enter the dark springs, never to attain immortality.

Those who possess these vestments are attended by two jade lads and two jade maidens, who guard and serve the Perfected. They must not be lent to others. If one is clad in the imperial vestments but lacks this resonance, or treats the divine garments with irreverence, five transgressions will leave no hope of immortality, and ten transgressions will result in punishment by the Left Bureau.

For women studying the *Highest Clarity* method of ascending to heaven in broad daylight, receiving the *Numinous Treasure Jade Instructions*, and soaring through the *Great Cavern*, they will all assume the rank of Lady of the Primordial Sovereign. On the day of entering the chamber, they must wear the Lady’s vestments: a hempen robe of purple gauze, two zhang and four chi in length, with sleeves cut short to fit. The robe should have sixteen seams on the sleeves and twenty-two on the body. They must also make a skirt of azure gauze, forty-five chi in length, with eight panels, each four feet and nine inches long. The remaining fabric is used for the waistband, dividing the eight panels into thirty-two seams. This is the "flying azure skirt," the vestment of the Lady.

When one dons these vestments, the myriad spirits will gird their sashes, and the thousand demons will vanish. Twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens will be assigned to attend and safeguard the ritual vestments.

Without these vestments, one may not chant the precious scriptures of the Supreme Clarity. Should one lightly use ordinary garments to recite the supreme scriptures, celestial demons will invade one’s voice, spirits will scatter, and qi will disperse—thus attaining immortality becomes impossible.

From the *Regulations for Reading Scriptures* in the *Scripture of True Traces*:
The records state: Jade lads and jade maidens who attend the scriptures, along with those who oversee Daoist practitioners of the written Way, report merits and expose transgressions, which are heard by the Primordial Masters of the Mysterious Center in the Supreme Clarity. Grave offenses incur punishment from the Three Officials; minor offenses strip one’s life-record and shorten one’s years. Major sins bring calamity upon the three generations of ancestors; minor sins confine misfortune to the self. Disrespect causes spirits to depart; defilement causes scriptures to withdraw. Those who study immortality—when unfolding sacred texts, they must rise, bow, and burn incense. The celestial spirits oversee and inspect: how could one not be reverent and cautious?

All who have not received transmission may not recklessly speak even a single line or character, for to do so violates the statutes against leaking celestial writings.

From the *Scripture of the Yellow Plain of the Cavern-Realms’ Forty-Four Methods*:
Whenever a Daoist, having received the supreme methods, wishes to recite scriptural texts, upon unfurling the scroll, they must first burn incense, bow in devotion before the scripture, and click their teeth five times. Then they softly recite the incantation:
*"Supreme laws of the Jade Emperor, heard on high by the Three Clarities.
On this auspicious day of fasting, I dare to open the divine scripture.
Ten thousand trials conceal and submit; all endeavors shall succeed.
Jade lads attend and guard; jade blossoms scatter fragrance.
I report above to the Three Primes, granting me long life."*
Only after completing the incantation may one open the scripture and proceed to recite it. Minor offenses strip one’s life-record; minor sins confine misfortune to the self. This is called the method of the Great Emperor for opening scriptures, commanding jade lads and jade maidens to attend and guard, burning incense to invoke and welcome the divine spirits, and reporting above to the Nine Heavens.

From the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles of the Cavern-Realms*:
When scholars enter the chamber to recite scriptures, they must be girded with the sashes of the Five Emperors and assume the floating positions of the Four Controllers. They may not face the scriptures while speaking, nor converse with outsiders. To omit or mangle phrases, to delay the arrival of celestial perfected ones, or to allow thoughts to wander—three such transgressions sever merit and cut off affairs, preventing attainment of immortality; ten transgressions subject the body to punishment by the Left Officials. When entering the chamber to recite scriptures, one must ensure that words and phrases flow in sequence, without skipping or omitting the celestial sounds.

Should a single phrase be lost, one must recite a hundred phrases anew to recover it; should two phrases be lost, two hundred must be recited; should five phrases be lost, five hundred must be recited before proceeding. If a single phrase is missed, recite an entire chapter to make amends. Ten to thirty such transgressions nullify merit and sever affairs, preventing attainment of immortality. Fifty to a hundred transgressions subject one’s seven generations of ancestors and oneself to punishment by the Left and Right Officials—enduring the knife mountains, consuming fire, the twenty-four hells, and the torments of the Three Wastes.

When entering the chamber to recite scriptures, one must fix the gaze upon the text and concentrate the mind upon the perfected deities, without allowing stray thoughts or wayward imaginings to disrupt the celestial sounds. Ten to thirty transgressions nullify merit and sever affairs, preventing attainment of immortality.

When reciting scriptures of a thousand phrases or fewer, one may not consume drink while facing the text; from a thousand to five thousand phrases, one may take a single drink; from five thousand to ten thousand, two drinks; and above ten thousand, three drinks. One may not recklessly consume food or drink to the detriment of the qi-infused recitation. Five to ten transgressions nullify merit and sever affairs, preventing attainment of immortality.

When reciting ten thousand phrases, if exhaustion overwhelms, one may pause briefly to recover, but must thereafter complete the passage in full. Even so, one may not leave unfinished phrases overnight, lest the celestial measure be diminished. Five to ten transgressions nullify merit and sever affairs, preventing attainment of immortality.

When entering the chamber to recite scriptures, if male and female disciples study together, they may share the same room, but must occupy separate beds. When reciting facing north, men should be positioned to the east and women to the west, without mingling seats, rising, reclining, or resting together. Three transgressions sever merit and nullify affairs, preventing attainment of immortality; five transgressions subject the body to punishment by the Left Officials.

When reciting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, the *One Hundred Spirit Treasures of the Cyclical Wind and Primordial Union*, the *Jade Tallies and Feminine One: Five Elders’ Treasure Scripture*, the *Wondrous Scripture of the Great Profundity of Primordial Numinosity*, the *Concealed Writ of the Great Elixir*, or the texts of the Highest Perfected Ones, one must face north, bow in reverence to the four directions, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and visualize within the five viscera the generation of five-colored qi, which infuses the essence of the Five Stars. Only then may one first recite the *Seven Cycles of the Divine Continent*, followed by the *Inner Names of the Hundred Spirits*, before proceeding to the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*. When reciting, mind and gaze must align, without stray thoughts or wayward imaginings to disturb the true deities. One must complete every phrase in full; to pause midway or skip phrases is to be seized by the Left Officials—three transgressions prevent attainment of immortality.

When reciting the *Thirty Scrolls of the Precious Scripture of the Highest Clarity* and its independent oral instructions, one must face north, bow in reverence to the four directions, knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and visualize the threefold essence of the Five Stars, sun, and moon infusing one’s body. Only then may one recite the scripture and perform the rites, ensuring that mind and mouth align without stray thoughts. One must unfurl the scroll and complete every phrase in full, without pausing or omitting any. Three transgressions prevent attainment of immortality; five transgressions subject one’s seven generations of ancestors, parents, and oneself to seizure by the Left and Right Officials.

When reciting the *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*, whether the *Cavern Profundity* or *Ascending Profundity*, one must face east, knock the teeth twelve times, swallow saliva twelve times, bow twice, and visualize the qi of purple clouds covering one’s crown and body. Only then may one recite, ensuring that mind and gaze align, without allowing the eyes to wander or the mind to entertain stray thoughts. One must unfurl the scroll and complete every phrase in full, without pausing or omitting the celestial sounds. Three transgressions utterly prevent attainment of immortality; five or more subject one to punishment by the Left Officials.

When reciting the great characters of the *Celestial Sovereign*, *Earthly Sovereign*, and *Human Sovereign* and practicing their Dao, one must face south, bow twice, knock the teeth twelve times, and swallow qi twelve times. Visualize the Celestial Sovereign, nine inches in height, draped in a cyan mantle, clad in a cyan brocade skirt, wearing a nine-rayed jewel crown, and holding in the left hand a jade tablet of flying transcendence. The Human Sovereign, nine inches in height, draped in a yellow mantle, clad in a yellow brocade skirt, wearing a seven-colored jewel crown, and holding in the right hand the jade tablet of life-preservation of the Highest Sovereign. The Earthly Sovereign, nine inches in height, draped in a white brocade mantle, clad in a plain brocade skirt, wearing a three-dawn jade crown, and holding in the rear the jade tablet of primordial record-settling. The Three Sovereigns stand to the left and right of the practitioner. Only then may one unfurl the scroll and perform the rites. In practicing this Dao, one may not engage in yin-yang union, tread upon defilement, or profane the celestial texts, lest one offend the true numina and incur punishment by the Left and Right Officials.

**Scripture Categories**
*The Scripture of the Cavern Profundity’s Empty Cavern Numinous Chapters:*

Devout faithful men and women, with incense and lamps as offerings, shall in this life attain radiant illumination, enter the realm of non-action, and receive blessings as a natural endowment. Should one maintain long-term abstinence, recite the numinous chapters of the scriptures, and complete ten thousand repetitions, the Dao will be perfected, the body shall generate water and fire, and one shall immediately attain flight.

This Dao is lofty and wondrous; it must not be leaked or divulged.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Profundity’s Jade Capital Mountain:*
Should the practitioner maintain long-term abstinence and deep contemplation, chant and recite the *Dao and Virtue Cavern Scripture*, while knocking the teeth and swallowing saliva, exhaling and inhaling the Great Harmony, the body shall turn golden, the nape shall bear a halo of radiance, the head shall be adorned with the brilliance of the sun, and the hands shall grasp the ten-jade-streamer banner of the Dark Effulgence Numinous Talisman. Such virtue is majestic, the Dao’s utmost honor. Boundless and wondrous transformations shall ensue, and one shall become a Perfected of the Most High.

This shall move the Great Non-Being, stir the Heavenly Elder, summon flying dragons, and descend celestial immortals.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Profundity’s Nine Heavens Divine Chapters:*
*The Celestial Birth Divine Chapter* is formed from the coalesced qi of the Three Caverns’ soaring mystery, its sacred sounds structuring numinous script. It unites the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names within its hidden rhymes, shaping life and death—an innate chapter.

When the *Celestial Treasure* is recited, it opens the light of heaven and earth.
When the *Numinous Treasure* is recited, it awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms from eternal night.
When the *Divine Treasure* is recited, it commands the myriad spirits.
When the *Great One* is recited, it completes the body’s gods.
When the *Imperial Lord* is recited, it shapes the form.
When the *Nine Heavens* is recited, it gives birth to humanity.
When scholars recite it, they ascend to heaven.
When ghosts and spirits hear it, they ascend and advance.
When ordinary folk hear it, they attain longevity.
When imprisoned souls hear it, they are liberated.
When withered bones hear it, they emit smoke.
When infants hear it, they gain speech.
When the dead hear it, they return to life.

The Three Treasures’ divine mysteries are the root of all existence; thus, they are beyond the knowledge of ghosts and spirits or the perception of ordinary folk.

Those in the Three Primordials’ Palace who bear golden names and purple characters, inscribed for future lives, destined to become Perfected Immortals of the Three Clarities, shall receive this text.

Reciting it once, the sound ascends to the Nine Heavens.
Reciting it twice, heaven and earth display reverence.
Reciting it thrice, the Three Realms offer homage.
Reciting it four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals.
Reciting it five times, the Five Emperors attend the Perfected.
Reciting it six times, the Demon Kings bind themselves.
Reciting it seven times, the stellar lodges halt their gates.
Reciting it eight times, the dark nights become luminous.
Reciting it nine times, all heavens descend, and every spirit without exception guards the practitioner’s chariot.

One recitation pierces the heavens, unblocking the source of the womb.
Two recitations resound through the earth, dissolving the roots of the fetal bond.
Three recitations invoke divine homage, refining the soul at the Gate of Spirits.
Four recitations summon the Heavenly Kings to witness, opening the gates of the dark nights.
Five recitations bring the Five Emperors to attend the Perfected, cooling the viscera.
Six recitations subdue the Demon Kings to obedience, generating fluids in the stomach channel.
Seven recitations brighten the stellar lodges, opening the orifices to wisdom.
Eight recitations illuminate the dark nights, perfecting the Three Sections and Eight Effulgences in body and spirit.
Nine recitations bring the descent of all heavens, where the Three Passes, Five Viscera, Six Bowels, Nine Palaces, Golden Towers, Jade Chambers, Twelve-Layered Gates, Purple Portals, Jade Enclosures, and thirty-six thousand joints—all roots and origins—simultaneously generate gods.

Nine recitations make one full cycle. Upon completing one cycle, the Three Realms record one’s name, the Five Emperors acknowledge kinship, and one is called a Perfected.
Ten cycles harmonize qi, commanding the myriad spirits. The Demon Kings act as guarantors, and one is listed among the heavens.
A hundred cycles harmonize the spirit, enabling spontaneous attainment. The Great One bestows talismans, and the Primordial Lord grants rebirth.
A thousand cycles harmonize the numinous, allowing one to sit or stand at will in life or death. Immortal youths and jade maidens serve at one’s command.
Ten thousand cycles complete the Dao, enabling one to ride a dragon-drawn chariot and ascend in broad daylight.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Profundity’s Five Praises:*
The Perfected of the Great One and Primordial Unity states: The *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue* are the subtlest of scriptures, expounding the intent of the Dao and the teachings of true correctness—brilliant and wondrous script. Reciting it for a thousand days with an empty mind and focused contemplation, one shall ascend to immortality in broad daylight and become a Perfected of the Western Florescence. This is the lineage of the highest immortals, and it may also bring blessings to the seven generations of ancestors.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Profundity’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity:*
The Dao states: Those of superior learning who cultivate and recite this scripture shall immediately receive deliverance and ascend to the Southern Palace. Those in the world who recite it shall extend their years and longevity, and afterward, all shall attain the Dao of liberation through simulated death. The soul and spirit shall briefly vanish, bypassing the earthly peaks, and immediately regain form, roaming the Great Void. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally delivering boundless beings. All celestial and human beings receive its blessings, immeasurable fortune, and grace in life and death.

On the day of one’s life-destiny, reciting and chanting this scripture shall purify the soul and spirit, perpetuating the myriad qi, sparing one from suffering and affliction. The body shall radiate light, the Three Realms shall serve as guards, the Five Emperors shall receive one, the myriad spirits shall pay homage, and one’s name shall be inscribed in the heavens.

The Dao states: If one’s Daoist learning is shallow, or the immortal rank incomplete, and the time of demise arrives, passing through the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, fellow practitioners and perfected beings shall burn incense and recite the scripture ten times to deliver the corpse-form according to the method. The soul and spirit shall ascend directly to the Southern Palace, and based on the merit of one’s studies, one shall be reborn after a calculated period, escaping the wheel of rebirth and attaining immortality.

The Dao states: When the cycles of heaven and earth reach their end, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the stellar lodges deviate from their courses and the sun and moon lose their clarity, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the ruler faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When pestilence spreads and the people suffer death and injury, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When masters and friends pass away, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture.

Purification rites and scripture recitation carry immense merit: above, they dispel celestial disasters and protect the emperor; below, they ward off poison and harm, delivering the people. In life and death, all rely upon it, its blessings beyond measure. Thus, it is called the *Limitless Universal Deliverance of Celestial and Human Beings*.

The Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture may serve as the lord of heaven, earth, and the emperor.

When the myriad people perform these meritorious deeds—on days of calamity, resolving in their hearts to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture ten times—all the heavens record their names, and ten thousand spirits stand guard in attendance.

The Dao states: These are the great Brahma-hidden words among the heavens, the sounds of the Limitless. The ancient script was a full *zhang* in length. The Celestial Perfected Sovereign of Old transcribed its text to establish the correct intonation. Those who know its sound, perform purification rites, and recite it will have the Heavenly Kings of Flying Spirits descend to observe their persons, record their diligent merit, and submit it to the heavens. Ten thousand spirits will pay homage, earth deities will attend at their gates, and their great merit will be acknowledged. Demon kings will protect and recommend them as ascended immortals. Once their Dao is complete and they attain perfection, they may roam the Three Realms and ascend through the Golden Gate.

The *Scripture of the Golden Chamber of the Cavern-Real for Deliverance and Life* states: This scripture is the supreme jade chapter, the numinous篇 of the Great Cavern, arrayed within the singular form. Reciting it once, the wondrous principle is naturally understood; reciting it ten times, one’s countenance reverts to youthful radiance; reciting it a hundred times, the inner embryo transforms into an immortal; reciting it a thousand times, one may sit in death or stand in dissolution; after ten thousand recitations, with the Dao complete, one ascends at dawn in broad daylight. Abiding in perpetual purification and tranquil seclusion, untouched by the dust of the world, the Dao descends without fail, and ascension to immortality is but a matter of days.

Each ten recitations count as one *bian*. With each *bian*, one ingests one *Golden Chamber Life-Preserving Talisman*. After ten *bian*, having ingested ten talismans, one achieves communion with the divine and attains truth, sitting in vision of the eight directions. The hundred passages are ordered, the nodes of spirit are regulated, and the myriad *qi* converge in harmony. Thus, one may attain longevity, their lifespan matching heaven and earth, their years equal to the Three Luminaries.

The *Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Crimson Writ of the Dragon’s Radiance and Purple Phoenix* states: The Crimson Writ of ninety-one words is the secret excerpted text received by the Perfected of the Western Citadel, the foundation of cultivation for immortality, the hidden sound of the phoenix’s *qi*. Those who obtain and wear it become immortals; those who practice it attain perfection. For ordinary people who uphold it, it wards off afflictions.

Should one maintain unwavering fasting and ascetic practice, dwelling in secluded mountains, reciting and chanting ten thousand times, they shall summon dragons to mount the void, ascend to Jade Clarity, and remain concealed among mortals. Wearing the script and intoning its sounds, divine officials will come to pay homage. With each recitation, the spirit brightens and *qi* clears; a thousand demons bind themselves, and ten thousand *mara* dissolve their forms.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Plain and Numinous* states:
The Perfected of the Great Ultimate declares: *The Cavern-Mystery Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Plain and Numinous* was born coeval with the Primordial Beginning. As its numinous text exists, all Perfected Ones approach the seat, burn incense, and venerate the scripture, reciting and chanting its twenty-one chapters to celebrate in the divine court. The jade tones ring clear, resounding through the Nine Heavens. Its phrases are subtle and profound, its wondrous essence branching in all directions. With a single recitation, the myriad spirits awaken to numinosity. One must constantly study and practice it to unite with the Emperor in perfection, resolve the heavy retributions of past transgressions, extricate the seven mysteries from the dark palace, release the five sufferings from sorrowful souls, and ascend one’s body to the Three Heavens. How wondrous and subtle is this numinous text!

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* states:
The hymns of the Three Heavens—when one receives this text and recites it in a separate chamber, a thousand recitations commune with the divine, and ten thousand recitations commune with perfection. To commune with the divine is to converse with spirits and foreknow fortune and misfortune; to commune with perfection is to behold the countenance of the Primordial Beginning, enter water without sinking, enter fire without burning, pass through calamities and perils, and soar through the Three Clarities.

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Jade Chapters of the Azure Empyrean’s Resplendent Writ* states:
Among all scriptures for cultivation, the Jade Chapters take precedence. Recite and chant them in a quiet chamber, and stillness will bring forth radiant clouds. All *mara* submit and serve; no trial dares approach. As one practices according to their will, they attain the perfection of the Dao. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete, and the body ascends to the Grand Clarity.

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Wisdom and Insight: The Great Precepts of Observing the Body* states:
The Lord Emperor of the Heavenly August Microcosm declares: Those who study the Dao yet do not uphold the Great Precepts of Observing the Body, though they recite scriptures ten thousand times and dwell in secluded mountains, may still find the hope of ascending as immortals elusive!

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Dispensing Salvation to Foreign Realms* states:
One should burn incense in a quiet chamber, make vows, and cultivate practice. With a single recitation, the myriad Perfected Ones gather, the Five Elders descend in form, heavenly *mara* bow in submission, and immortals and Perfected Ones are summoned.

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Jade Tallies of the Three Primes* states:
The ethereal chants of the Jade Clarity’s Upper Palace, resplendent and desolate, comprise ninety chapters governed by the Lords of the Three Primes. The Lords constantly chant these verses to harmonize the *qi* of form and soul, celebrating the Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces. Those who practice the Dao of the Three Primes must intone these chants to seek the advent of the supremely numinous, summoning them from the mysterious void and guiding them along the ford’s path.

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Talismans of the Cinnabar Numinosity of the Six Jia* states:
In the Jade Palace of the Upper Clarity, the Jade Maidens inscribe golden tablets with the hymns of the Upper Palace, their voices blending in song. Their tones ascend to Jade Clarity, celebrating the divine Perfected Ones and dissolving stagnation in the eternal yang. Those who obtain this text will have the Six Jia descend in form. By maintaining constant purity and fasting, chanting the numinous sounds, they may ride the white simurgh to ascend to the Jade Palace. Those who study yet lose this Dao waste their form and spirit in vain; the heavenly Perfected will not descend, and they shall have no means to attain immortality. For those cultivating the Dao of the Six Jia, on each *jia* day, they must enter the chamber, ingest the talisman, and recite the hymns of the Six Palaces. After six years of communion, the Jade Maidens will descend to the chamber, converse face-to-face, and convey the practitioner on dragons to soar through the empyrean, ascending in bodily form. Secrecy ensures numinous descent; leakage invites calamity.

*The Scripture of the Cavern-Real, Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* states:
*The Hidden Incantations of the Great Cavern of Jade Clarity* are the celestial texts of the Nine Heavens, issuing from the oral instructions of the Most High, dissolving stagnation and dispersing its source. The thirty-nine chapters of the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* reach their ultimate principle here. Above, they summon the radiance of the loftiest numinous clouds; below, they extinguish the misfortunes of the myriad *mara*. With a single recitation, the dark barriers open, and the thirty-nine portals receive the jade nectar. The *qi* of death sinks and obstructs no more, and the hundred spirits rejoice within. Once the hundred spirits flow freely, their voices reach the Nine Mysteries, their *qi* brightens the Purple Empyrean, their echoes resound in the Jade Dawn. The Five Emperors gird their sashes, the myriad spirits attend the chamber, the living generations return in homage, the seven ancestors ascend, and the body gains feathered wings. Mounting the radiance and riding the clouds, one flies to Jade Clarity and takes one’s place among the Purple Retinue. This is the wondrous Dao of the Lofty Mystery, the secret chapters of Jade Clarity.

Observe the precepts of the body from the fifth to the three hundredth, the Dao of the Most High’s Boundless, named the *Highest Jade Clarity Wisdom Upper Prime Precepts*.

**The Cavern Reality Wisdom Observing the Body Great Precepts Scripture**

The Heavenly King of Original Beginning said: The *Highest Cavern Reality Wisdom Scripture* is not proclaimed to worldly scholars; it is mostly transmitted to those who have already become Perfected Ones. What is seen is difficult to see; having seen it, it is difficult to exhaust. Thus, it is rarely seen in the world.

These precepts are revered and weighty; they cannot be proclaimed in words. By observing the myriad spirits within the human body, the three hundred joints’ true numina are not allowed to recklessly depart, and demonic trials cannot violate them. Those who receive and recite these precepts without transgressing their prohibitions may ascend as immortals without study. Azure clouds and jade chariots will naturally welcome you; at dawn, you will ascend to heaven, your body floating in the empty void, roaming freely through the ten directions. A halo will appear around your neck, radiant and luminous in the Great Emptiness. The hosts of heavenly sages will have no choice but to revere and look up to you.

At that time, the Great Demon Kings of the Six Heavens will immediately elevate those who uphold the precepts, reporting their names to the Eastern Flower Palace, which will report them to the Great Brahma Heaven Palace, and the Great Brahma Heaven Palace will report them to the Jade Capital Golden Portals, where they will be inscribed among the ranks of the highest immortals.

The Heavenly King of Original Beginning said: The *Great Cavern Reality Scripture* states that chanting it ten thousand times will summon cloud chariots to descend and welcome you. The *Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Scripture* contains passages on transcending kalpas, yet those who cultivate it may still fail to become immortals, and those who compound the golden elixir and numinous medicines may still fail to succeed. Why is this? It is because they have not received and upheld the *Wisdom Observing the Body Precepts*.

These precepts are the most wondrous of wonders, their majestic spirit supremely revered. Nine hundred Golden Flower Immortals stand in attendance, burning incense. This is the true secret Dao, not transmitted in writing but only through recitation and chanting.

Those who study the Dao but do not receive these precepts will never attain immortality. Some may create karmic obstacles and fall into sensual pleasures; some may begin diligently but grow lax in the end; some may enter mountains or dwell at home, only to be tested and defeated by demonic forces; some may harbor heterodox thoughts and doubt the true scriptures; some may return to worldly ways, losing all Daoist resolve; some may slight their teachers and friends, insulting their fellow students; some may suddenly become mad or foolish, their nature and qi inverted, growing greedy for wealth and enamored of beauty, even belittling the Three Treasures. Some may encounter misfortune in their family circumstances, with grievances and hardships converging; some may suffer from nightmares and chaotic thoughts, their spirits troubled and melancholy. All these afflictions arise from lacking the great precepts to govern their body and spirit, allowing the Three Poisons and floating corpses to disturb the five viscera.

The Demon Kings will not erase the names of the dead from the ledgers of the Yellow Springs; those who do not transcend the Three Realms will not enter the immortal ranks.

The Heavenly King of Original Beginning said: These precepts were revealed through numinous immortals, and now all heavenly beings, earthly immortals, and renowned mountain sages uphold and practice them. On every new and full moon, the eight seasonal nodes, one’s birthdays, and the celestial fast days, fellow students, teachers, and friends should enter the chamber to recite the precepts once through. First, pay homage to the ten directions, bowing once to each.

When the heavens hear the sound of the precepts being recited, all will bow in reverence. Disciples who wish to uphold them should offer five taels of superior gold as a token to the Five Emperors, and ten bolts of cinnabar brocade as a pledge to the ten directions.

The covenant of the hairpin’s fall must not leak the precepts’ rules; they are to be offered to a master who holds the precepts. Master and disciple should fast together for three days, contemplating the precepts’ essence. On that evening, light ten lamps to illuminate the ten directions, offering the light to the Great Sages of the ten directions to manifest my heart.

When the celestial qi is harmonious and serene, if at that time wind, rain, thunder, or lightning surge violently, one must not receive the precepts. Instead, fast anew and recompose oneself with reverence, for at such a moment the spirit scatters and the mind dissipates.

Upholding the precepts for nine years, the body becomes a candle illuminating itself; the radiance of sun and moon and the essence of cinnabar will naturally arrive. A golden countenance will emerge from within, the complexion of youth will fill the flesh, and divine penetration will extend in all four directions. Ascending to the heights of immortality, one’s virtue will equal that of the Perfected. Moving in and out without obstruction, one may bathe one’s cap tassels in the rushing waters of the pool, loosen one’s robe upon the Terrace of Seven Treasures, and wander beneath the shade of lotus blossoms, returning to the fragrant forest where light shines brilliantly and flourishes. From kalpa to kalpa, one will forever enjoy the truth of the Dao.

On the noon of one’s natal day or at midnight, facing north, recite the *Great Supreme’s Revolving Mystery, Great Chapter*, to penetrate the ten directions. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity declares: This precept is called the *Precept of Wisdom Observing the Body*; it is also named the *Scripture of Preserving the Immortal Spirit*, and the *Supreme Cavern-Real Scripture of Delivering Life*. Unless one possesses the accumulated merit of past lives, the blessings of successive karmic deeds, and the extension of felicitous destiny, one will never be permitted to behold this precious secret. Even the name inscribed on the Golden Tablet of the Eastern Flowery Pool will not allow one to encounter such a master. Those who uphold it are destined to become immortals.

To possess scriptures without precepts is like wishing to cross the sea without a boat, or having a mouth without a tongue—how could one ferry across the countless bodies? Students who seek scriptures but do not seek precepts fail to grasp the root of the true essentials, remaining in a long dream without awakening. This is truly a cause for grief! All should measure their capacity to uphold them; if one’s resources suffice for more than one person, to transmit the precepts to another is to leak them. The sin will extend to seven generations of ancestors, and parents will suffer confinement in the dark prisons of hell. The body will tread the Three Wretched Paths, enduring the Five Sufferings and Eight Calamities. From kalpa to kalpa, beginning anew without end, one will revolve through the evil destinies of the Wheel of Transmigration, drifting ever farther from immortality. Debtors and adversaries will meet in due time—each must guard their person well.

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity declares: Should anyone dare to eavesdrop on the recitation of the precepts, they will be struck by the evil demons of the world. The calamity that befalls them is certain, without the slightest doubt.

If a disciple upholding the precepts dwells alone in the mountains or a place of dread, strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-four times, and concentrate the mind on the deities of the precepts. The deities of the precepts will encircle and protect them in three layers. Demons, ghosts, and malevolent spirits will not dare approach; blessings and virtue will constantly follow them, and the good spirits of the various heavens will each surround and guard them. Even former debtors and adversaries will generate hearts of compassion.

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity declares: When I first began my studies, I only knew to request scriptures and did not know to seek the precepts. Thus, I passed through kalpas of birth and death. The Supreme One pitied my devotion to the Dao, and the Most High took mercy on my unrelenting efforts, revealing to me: “Your studies are ever diligent, yet you do not uphold the *Great Precept of Observing the Body*—how then could you attain immortality?” Thereupon, I prostrated myself beneath the Golden Gates for three thousand days. The Supreme One bestowed upon me the essential precepts, which I upheld and cultivated. Within nine years, cloud chariots came to welcome me, and the Perfected Ones of the Three Realms and the ten directions gathered in the Mysterious Void.

Thus, those who study the Dao must place precepts and regulations first; they are the honored foundation of the Daoist tradition. The method requires recitation until it flows from the mouth, for the ancient sages kept it secret and did not commit it to writing. Even now, it is the same: the true text must not be allowed to leak to the vulgar and common.

The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity declares: If one studies the Dao without upholding the *Great Precept of Observing the Body*, reciting scriptures ten thousand times and dwelling in seclusion in the mountains, can one truly hope to ascend as an immortal? If one can perfect the precepts within and harmonize one’s light without, one may yet approach the precipice of the numinous standard. It is not that the study of the Dao is difficult—upholding the precepts is difficult! If you can fulfill the precepts completely, I and the ten directions, along with the Supreme One, will ensure your ascension as an immortal.

If one perfects the precepts and recites the precious scriptures, wearing the great talismans, and still does not attain immortality, then there is no path in the world that does not lead to death. What I have spoken is rare to find in the world! In this degenerate age, many cling to fame and superficial glory, seldom revealing the true heart of virtue and the Dao. Thus, the Three Treasures lie obscured, and the sages remain in seclusion. Is the Dao not vast? If one fully receives the precepts, the true sages of the ten directions will naturally appear to you—thus, without study, the Way of immortality is achieved.

These are not empty words—what purpose would empty words serve? I merely pity the aspiring scholars of the world. When the conditions and opportunities align, there may yet be those who can be taught. Strive on, exert yourselves! Once the Way of immortality is accomplished, what joy could compare? Roaming freely in the capital of the Supreme One, wandering at ease in the realm of spontaneity—this is the joy of the Supreme One. Even ten thousand kalpas past cannot begin to describe it, for it truly cannot be expressed in brush and ink.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate declares: I once heard the Dao from the Supreme One, who instructed: “To recite the *Three Treasures Cavern Scriptures* without upholding this great precept—how could the myriad wonders of the immortal Way be attained?” Thus, it was spoken only orally and not committed to writing, remaining secluded within the gardens of the Three Treasures. Even those without the auspicious marks of a supreme immortal will never be permitted to see it. Unless one’s seven generations of ancestors have accumulated blessings, their flourishing virtue casting shade, and the karmic conditions of past deeds extending through hidden merit across kalpas, how could one aspire to delight in the *Precept of Observing the Body* of the Supreme One? Those who uphold this precept become the honored masters of the Three Treasures and the foundation of the Supreme One’s great Dharma. The ten directions will revere you in the Cloud Han, and the assembly of immortals will lead you to the Eastern Flowery Pool. You will sit in audience before the heavenly demons, and the Demon King will present your talismanic mandate to the palaces of the Six Heavens of Desire and the Springs and Bends. The Master of Mount Tai and the officials of the Earth Bureau will no longer possess records of your death. Your immortal name will be fixed in the Azure Palace, and you will become a high immortal of the Jade Capital, a Perfected One of the Supreme One.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate declares: The essentials of the Dao lie in aligning one’s conduct with the hidden statutes, accumulating goodness within until it is sufficient, and only then can one ascend to the realm of the Great Dao. Those who cannot do this labor in vain amidst the dust and wind, gaining nothing for the length or brevity of their lives.

The Dao resides within me, not in others. Only with compassion, only with love, only with goodness, only with forbearance—practicing these four equalities, one draws near to the Dao.

Those who are diligent and faithful, who embrace stillness, who persevere to the end, who admonish with purity, and who renounce sensuality and wine—these are the six perfections of the Dao, and they place one among the company of the Perfected. Those who endure wrongs without self-justification, who yield virtue to others, who do not covet what others desire, who tolerate the unreasonable and impure, who distance themselves from the unprincipled, who conceal themselves in seclusion, who do not violate their conscience, who do not betray the scriptures and precepts, and who do not recite by rote—these eight capacities make one a companion of goodness.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate declares: The precepts as the essence of the Dao are majestic and spiritually wondrous, yet fearing that people may lack the resolve to uphold them, they are kept secret and unwritten. Thus, the chapters of the *Scripture of Wisdom* are never fully revealed to those of shallow learning. Passed down orally from mouth to mouth, how could they be leaked? When the precepts are expounded, devas and humans from the ten directions clasp their hands in reverent listening, while ghosts and spirits bow in homage to what they hear—how could this be taken lightly?

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate declares: The ancients who cultivated the Dao abided in profound tranquility, their minds free of attachments, their mouths silent, their bodies unadorned. Serene and boundless, utterly still, they sat in forgetfulness of the true Dao, already perfected in effortless dignity, as cloud-borne chariots stood ready to receive them. Some rode the phoenix through the void, some mounted dragons through the heavens, their bodies treading the formless, ascending to the Great Ultimate, their forms moving through the empty expanse without reliance. Thus, their traces could not be seen, the world knew them not, and those who knew them were rare—such rarity was their true value. This is what is meant by "those who align in spirit and covenant become teachers and friends, their words mysterious yet steadfast." This is not the way of high antiquity but a fabrication of later learners.

If a scholar truly wishes to request the precious scriptures, one must carefully observe their character. Once their understanding is thoroughly awakened, they may present themselves before the Most High, make their petition, and receive the text, following its words as the supreme law of the Most High’s mysterious statutes. Without the capacity to uphold the great Dao, how could one presume to violate this, even with the witness of the seven ancestors and the ten directions? One must first reflect deeply: can your body truly uphold this? The three paths of hell, the ten sufferings, the eight calamities—how could these be taken lightly? Contemplating them chills the heart of all worthy and good; vigilance in the precepts brings blessings naturally. To turn against this resolve is to invite misfortune just as naturally. Agony will pierce the body, moment by moment, with no escape—how much worse through endless kalpas?

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate declares: Though kalpas may end and begin anew, the precepts remain the unchanging Dao, received orally and practiced bodily by the ancients. When the Dao is perfected, one’s traces may be manifest or hidden, leaving later generations unable to fathom their cultivation. Thus, in high antiquity, some attained the Dao by donning robes and sitting in forgetfulness, while the Yellow Emperor cast his cauldrons and was received by a dragon. They could perceive the ten directions with clarity and transcend the three realms. Wang Qiao and Chi Songzi, who rode the purple mist to soar in the celestial courts, were of their kind. Such examples cannot all be recorded—are these not the worthies of whom it is said that they attained immortality without study?

*Concluding the Forty-Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Mysteries*
*Beginning the Forty-Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Mysteries*

The *Ascending Mystery Precepts*: The Five Precepts of Ascending Mystery

The Dao teaches: Sensual indulgence ruins affairs—it must not be practiced. Yet both the wise and foolish, the noble and base of the world share the same desires. Only the Daoist can uphold resolve, firmly adhere to the teachings and precepts, restrain conduct in movement and stillness, and keep the heart from inclining toward depravity. Amidst the snares of love and desire, they never once transgress.

When encountering beauty, profit, glory, or dazzling splendor, they cover their eyes with the precept.
When hearing flattery or slander, or the five tones of music, they seal their ears with the precept.
When presented with delicacies of the eight treasures or sweet and fragrant delicacies, they shut their mouths with the precept.
When coveting wealth, the seven precious gems, or indulging in extreme desires, they subdue their hearts with the precept.
When recalling lewdness, greed, or other vile matters, they break their thoughts with the precept.

Those who practice these five things will cause their seven generations of ancestors to ascend to heaven, where clothing and food arise naturally. Their bodies will attain divine transcendence, ascending at dawn in broad daylight. Even if they undergo liberation through simulated death, they will transform and become perfected. The worthy ones devote themselves to this with utmost sincerity.

If men or women cannot accept and uphold these precepts, refusing to receive and maintain them, nothing can be done for them!

I would rather give a man ten thousand gold than inscribe these words. Daoist Master of the Way’s Descendants must choose carefully to whom they transmit them, and never leak the true scriptures.

The Most High Dao Lord still chants and laments:

What is affliction?
It all arises from within the body.
The eye beholds radiant beauty,
the ear fills with the five tones,
the mouth savors the eight delicacies,
the mind covets wealth and glory,
the will craves lewd acts—
hands and feet carry them out.
Once the five evils do not cease,
judgment appears in the omen of form.
Forever cut off from the Way of life,
the dark soul perishes in the ghostly prison.
When the sentence is complete and one emerges,
there is a person, yet no feeling.
Those who uphold the precepts and do no evil
seal the five gates of the heart.
The eye does not gaze on ornate beauty,
the ear does not gather clamorous sounds,
the mouth does not feast on sweet delicacies,
the mind does not love money and wealth,
the will harbors no lewd imaginings,
hands and feet do not come and go.
When the five evils are stilled and cease,
how can judgment be pronounced?
Forever united with the true Dao,
no longer subject to the ghostly officials.
Merit accumulates from the precepts,
ascending at dawn to the Jade Morning.
The eye treats beauty as an enemy,
initially unwilling even to glance.
The ear treats sound as an enemy,
initially unwilling to desire hearing.
The mouth treats flavor as bitter,
initially unwilling to be tainted.
The mind treats treasure as stone,
initially unwilling to long for it.
The will treats lewdness as a thief,
initially unwilling to share its path.
The feet treat level ground as rugged,
initially unwilling to tread evenly.
These five follow the same road,
initially unwilling to incline toward the perverse.
Those who can be thus
are called rare among the wondrous.
Having penetrated what is rare,
no dregs or stagnation can remain.
The body pure, the spirit at peace,
the Sovereign Unity guards the cinnabar field.
Conduct perfected arises from within,
enabling ascent to the heavens.
The Dao says: Those who uphold the law and practice the Way
must diligently cultivate the body,
must firmly advance with vigor,
must long maintain the precepts,
must solidify focused mindfulness,
must hold fast to truthful contemplation.
Do not fail to preserve the Dao,
banish the perverse, banish delusion,
banish the demonic, banish the false,
banish lewdness, banish desire,
eliminate and discard all wrongs,
embrace the true as your wrapping.
This is to labor first and receive reward later,
to deliver the body and ascend as an immortal.
Focus on the future, not the present moment.

First, one must not be lewd and wanton,
letting the mind dwell on the perverse,
expending spirit and damaging essence,
so that the hun and po cannot be guarded,
the upright qi departs,
and the perverse comes to meet one.

Second, one must not let the temper flare in anger,
causing the heart to surge and rage,
the mouth to vent and raise the voice,
to curse and revile,
shaking heaven and earth.
The spirits do not protect such a person,
the true officials within the body report to the Three Heavens,
recording the name in the register of sins,
making immortality utterly unattainable.

Third, one must not harbor venomous thoughts,
envying others.
Heavenly scribes record it,
earthly officials report it,
the name is entered in the Black Book,
judgment extends to the point of execution.
This is most impermissible to violate,
as it harms even one’s descendants.

Fourth, one must not drink wine to the point of confusion,
defiling and polluting the body,
altering one’s usual nature,
disregarding the precepts,
defying official laws,
disrespecting father and lord,
failing to recognize one’s kin.
Drawn by desire,
the hun and po wail in sorrow,
filth stains the five spirits,
the mouth utters curses and complaints,
one acts perversely and disobediently.
Heaven sends down calamity,
the body suffers misfortune.

Fifth, one must not covet profit and wealth.
In the degenerate age, deception abounds,
human nature is fierce and corrupt.
Sometimes, for the sake of convenience,
one schemes and harms others.
Wealth is the body’s enemy—
what use is wealth?
If one has it but does not hoard it,
one should plant it in the field of blessings.
An empty hall, a pure chamber—
this is called the home of immortals.

These five must not be violated even once,
like treading on perilous ice,
like stepping into a dangerous chamber.
The sentence is certain to be pronounced,
yet one does not awaken to it.
The worthy, whether sitting, rising, lying, or resting,
must deeply use this to admonish themselves!

From the seventh scroll of the *Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious Inner Teachings*, "The Nine Precepts of Ascending the Mysterious."

The Most High addressed Dao Ling, saying: If one aspires to the Dao and seeks to cultivate the Great Vehicle’s teachings, one must delight in the emptiness of the mind, diligently practice and uphold the precepts, and faithfully observe them—thus may the Dao be established and attained. Simply receive and uphold these precepts, practice them with devotion, and I shall dispatch the Guardian Precept Generals and twenty-four mighty spirits to protect and defend you, severing the paths of evil and guiding you to the realm of goodness. In all your actions, you shall encounter auspiciousness, avoid misfortune and calamity, swiftly escape the way of death, and hasten to the attainment of immortality. Comprehending the secrets of emptiness and illuminating the meaning of non-being, you shall surely attain the supreme Dao.

The First Precept states: The body must not indulge in cruelty, recklessness, arrogance, extravagance, or dissipation; nor may it recklessly invite disaster, act with wanton abandon, delight in evil, or commit wrongdoing. Adornment and excess, indulgence in rich and delicate flavors, self-gratification without restraint—these lead one unawares into the eyes of sin. One fails to recognize the magnitude of the body’s transgressions, which cannot be reckoned. One must not personally violate this precept, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the First Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Second Precept states: The mind must not harbor evil thoughts or intentions, nor entertain illusory or judgmental imaginings. One must not covet gain, blindly pursue profit, or scheme with malicious intent. One must not plot arrogantly, indulge in rich flavors without restraint, or remain unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin. One fails to recognize the boundless magnitude of the mind’s transgressions. One must not personally entertain such thoughts, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the Second Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Third Precept states: The mouth must not recklessly speak of good or evil, utter curses or insults, deceive with falsehoods, sow discord with double-tongued words, engage in disputes or estrangement, criticize others’ faults, create strife, or incite harm. One must not spread groundless rumors, peddle the Dao and its teachings, or indulge in singing, chanting, whistling, or sighing. One must not crave fine flavors without restraint, remaining unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin. One fails to recognize the boundless magnitude of the mouth’s transgressions. One must not personally violate this precept, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the Third Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Fourth Precept states: The hands must not kill or harm living beings, including crawling, creeping, or blood-bearing creatures. One must not rob, plunder, steal, or seize what is not one’s own, nor wield weapons to commit unlawful acts. One remains unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin, failing to recognize the immeasurable magnitude of the hands’ transgressions. One must not personally violate this precept, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the Fourth Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Fifth Precept states: The eyes must not gaze upon what is contrary to the Dao, the Dharma, or righteousness—nor upon ostentatious adornments, seductive appearances, or alluring beauty. One must not indulge in lewd or depraved sights, nor covet extravagant treasures. The eyes serve as the mind’s scouts, gathering all manner of misfortune. They invite calamity and poison, drawing transgressions together—all of which originate from the eyes. The mind, eyes, mouth, and hands are the sources of misfortune and the roots of disaster. Every movement becomes the beginning of suffering, the origin of transgressions. The mind, eyes, mouth, and hands are the storehouses of sin—one must not be careless, nor lax, nor negligent, nor indulgent. One remains unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin, failing to recognize the immeasurable magnitude of the eyes’ transgressions. One must proclaim this precept for the eyes, exhorting all beings—how can one guard the eyes? When the mind’s thoughts are unified, illusions vanish; when illusions vanish, intentions cease; when intentions are empty, one enters non-being without attachment, thereby attaining the wisdom of the Dao. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it without fail throughout one’s life—this is the Fifth Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Sixth Precept states: The ears must not listen to the eight tones or the five musical modes, nor to lewd or seductive sounds that bewilder and corrupt the state. One must not indulge in deceptive or perverse music without restraint, remaining unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin. One fails to recognize the magnitude of the ears’ transgressions, which are likewise grave. One must not personally violate this precept, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the Sixth Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Seventh Precept states: The nose must not covet fragrant or foul scents, nor recklessly discern good from evil. One remains unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin, failing to recognize the magnitude of the nose’s transgressions, which are also considerable. One must not personally violate this precept, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the Seventh Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Eighth Precept states: The feet must not tread upon what is contrary to righteousness or the Dharma, nor walk paths of evil or enter depraved or lewd realms. One remains unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin, failing to recognize the magnitude of the feet’s transgressions, which are also considerable. One must not personally violate this precept, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the Eighth Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

The Ninth Precept states: One must not indulge the passions or act recklessly, nor forcibly employ spiritual instruments to attack those one cannot overcome. One must not dissipate essence, scatter spirit, or lose the three qi. One must not let the mind roam unchecked without restraint, remaining unaware of how such actions entangle one in the net of sin, leading to the ruin of one’s clan and lineage. One fails to recognize the immeasurable magnitude of such transgressions. One must not personally violate this precept, nor instruct others to do so. Restrain the mind and uphold the precept, observing it throughout one’s life—this is the Ninth Precept of the Most High, the Supreme, the Great One.

From the ninth scroll of the *Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious Inner Teachings*, "The Wondrous Precepts Chapter."

The Wondrous Ten Precepts Heavenly Worthy declared: Those who receive these ten precepts and cultivate them in accordance with the Dharma shall be protected and defended by the heavenly officials of the ten directions, and shall surely attain the Dao. If, due to the burdens of the world, one cannot fulfill all ten, then observe nine, eight, seven, six, or even five, selecting those one is capable of upholding. Yet even the blessings of the five precepts are beyond reckoning. You must widely exhort all beings—if some, upon hearing this, remain unmoved or disinterested, still, even a single thread of understanding, a partial awakening, may lead them to gradual enlightenment.

Seven generations of ancestors will rejoice together, all good affinities will converge, and from beginning to end, one will enjoy glory and bliss. The Dharma-wheel will turn in due course, and one will attain the Dao of immortality.

The Eighth: Exhort and assist Daoists and the multitude in the study of scriptures; in life after life, one’s talent and wisdom will be penetrating and thorough, and in movement and stillness, one’s bearing will serve as a constant model for others.

The Ninth: Exhort and assist in all acts of almsgiving and admonition; in life after life, one will enjoy longevity, wealth, and happiness, ever free from resentment and vexation.

The Tenth: Exhort and assist all people in eliminating jealousy and desire, and in practicing all virtues; in life after life, one will dwell in peace and joy, with no calamities or disorders arising. The sick will recover of themselves, officials will be promoted to high ranks, and one will be revered by all. None will fail to receive blessings, one’s household will be pure and noble, and both celestial beings and humans will cherish and nurture one. Spirits and demons will show deference, and one will forever dwell in lands of fortune.

—From *The Scripture of Cavernous Mystery: Upper Grade of Wisdom* (*Dongxuan Zhihui Shangpin Jing*), "Precepts of the Cavernous Spirit" (*Dongshen Jiepin*)

**Precepts of the Three Realms of Cavernous Spirit**

On the day of receiving the scriptures and precepts, Lord Lilu of the Di clan exhorted: each should exert utmost effort and hasten to practice diligently. Thus, these precepts are reiterated with earnest admonition for careful reception.

The First Precept: Discern causes and conditions with clarity; do not forget the root while chasing the branches.
The Second Precept: Strictly guard against self-interest; do not seek gain for oneself at the expense of others.
The Third Precept: Diligently practice and cultivate; do not indulge in negligence and lose authenticity.

These Three Supreme Precepts are revered by the Supreme Sovereign, upheld by the Celestial Thearch, and cultivated by superior practitioners. Those who practice and uphold them whole and unbroken shall have the Three Qi’s true spirits descend to merge as one with their inner gods. As the One is without duality, how can the Dao not abide eternally? Such a one is called *Tai Shang*. Those who fail to observe these precepts yet wear talismanic texts will labor in vain, bearing no verification—they are not disciples of the *Tai Shang*.

**Five Precepts of Cavernous Spirit**

The Yellow Thearch said: Those who do not uphold precepts will find that officials and soldiers do not attend their bodies, and their attainments will lack verification, their efforts wasted. If one does not trust the Supreme Dao and serve the master, yet desires to command officials and soldiers to guard the body and protect life, avert death and attain rebirth, dispel illness and prolong life, eliminate calamities for others, rescue them from distress, engage in meditative contemplation, and obtain verification within a set time, one must receive the Five Precepts:

The First Precept: Let the eyes not covet the five colors; vow to rectify teachings and study longevity.
The Second Precept: Let the ears not covet the five sounds; aspire to hear goodness and follow it without confusion.
The Third Precept: Let the nose not covet the five qi; use ritual incense to dispel foulness.
The Fourth Precept: Let the mouth not covet the five flavors; practice embryonic breathing and refrain from evil speech.
The Fifth Precept: Let the body not covet the five adornments; engage in diligent labor to accord with the Dao.

These are the Five Precepts. The Five Venerable Thearchs each dispatch fifteen spirits to guard and protect the bodies of those who receive and uphold them.

**Eight Precepts of Cavernous Spirit**

The Yellow Thearch said: Once, while dwelling in seclusion, the *Tai Shang* descended and inquired about the great and small, the beginning and end of scriptures and precepts. Though I have received and upheld them, much remains unclear, and I have not fathomed their order. I now present this fully to the *Tai Shang*.

The *Tai Shang* replied: All precepts and disciplines should be practiced universally. Among them, urgency and ease, complexity and simplicity, loftiness and humility each bear significance. They correspond to the transformations of the mysterious source, and their generation follows a gradual progression—three, five, eight, nine, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand. Though they adapt to what one can bear, they must not be skipped or neglected. Knowing causes and turning toward correctness, one cultivates the method of immortality and deathlessness. Combining three and five, one should receive the Eight Precepts:

First: Study and comprehend the Five Provisions and Five Virtues.
Second: Diligently practice the Five Affairs without wavering.
Third: Harmonize the Eight Correct Paths; act and withdraw in accord with the seasons.
Fourth: Clearly recognize the Five Cycles and abide with qi.
Fifth: Precisely examine the Supreme Polarity; harmonize above and below.
Sixth: Cultivate the Three Intentions to meet the Three Pure Ones.
Seventh: Resolve doubts and transform falsity into truth.
Eighth: Examine and verify, dispel misfortune and descend blessings, refine the mortal to ascend as a sage, and not betray the Three Honored Ones.

These are the Eight Precepts. For those who set their hearts on learning and seeking liberation from the world, first uphold precepts, understanding without stagnation. Precepts, whether many or few, all belong to the *Tai Wu*. The *Tai Wu* and *Tai Kong* are the root of precepts. Guarding the root and investigating the branches, external evils naturally dissipate, and internal afflictions do not arise.

Moreover, first cultivate purification, for only through refinement can one communicate with spirits. Summoning them yields swift efficacy. Long-accumulated dust and filth must be cleansed, but one must be vigilant not to interrupt or forcefully expel them. Though one may establish this intention, the dust will not depart, and demons will come to disturb, increasing calamities and faults. To prevent this flaw, use precepts as the gradual path. Uphold them according to one’s capacity; if transgressed, confess and repent, reform and renew. When in accord, advance further, and the attainment of the Dao will come in time.

**From *The Scripture of Cavernous Spirit*, "Five Precepts of the Orthodox Unity"**

In preserving the One and guarding the Five Spirits, the essential lies in rectifying the heart. The heart is rectified through stillness; still the body and settle the heart. When the heart is settled, perception becomes clear; when clear and bright, one meets the Dao. Meeting the Dao, the spirit and talisman unite—this is called a true sage.

When in motion, one forgets the One, and the Five Spirits are disturbed by perversity. The Five Spirits become chaotic, agitation and competition arise, vexation and restlessness follow, the Dao is lost, and one sinks into worldliness. The Three Karmas run rampant, goodness is violated, and evil is committed. The Six Penetrations are obstructed, the Seven Awakenings are obscured, and desires become innumerable.

With innumerable desires, thoughts of transgression arise incessantly, beyond description. In broad terms, there are five:

First: The eyes desire to behold the five colors; excess in color wearies the hun-soul.
Second: The ears desire to hear the five sounds; excess in sound afflicts the po-soul.
Third: The nose desires to smell the five fragrances; excess in fragrance scatters essence.
Fourth: The mouth desires the five flavors; excess in flavor clouds the spirit.
Fifth: The body desires indulgence in the five pleasures; excess in pleasure scatters the will, and scattered will injures the spleen.

When the spirit is clouded, the heart is disordered, and the mouth loses its clarity. When essence scatters, the kidneys are depleted, and madness ensues. When the po-soul is afflicted, the lungs are damaged, and deafness follows. When the hun-soul is wearied, the liver is distressed, and blindness results. When these five intermingle, the body perishes and life ends. When these five are pure and bright, the body remains whole and years are prolonged.

Prolonged years depend on upholding precepts. Upholding the Five Precepts can lead to longevity.

First: Practice benevolence—compassion and love, refraining from killing; release and deliver living beings. Inwardly contemplate the wondrous gate; with eyes gazing long, the liver and hun-soul are at peace.
Second: Practice righteousness—rewarding goodness and punishing evil, humility and yielding in public and private, refraining from theft. The ears hear the mysterious sound, and the lungs and po-soul are in harmony.
Third: Practice propriety—revering elders and deferring to the young, maintaining stillness and secrecy in yin and yang, purity and correctness without licentiousness. The mouth is filled with the dew of the Dao, and the heart and spirit are in accord.
Fourth: Practice wisdom—transforming the ignorant to learn from sages, moderating alcohol to avoid confusion. The kidneys and essence unite.
Fifth: Practice trust—upholding loyalty and embracing the One, manifesting efficacy in the hidden and visible, harboring no doubts. Without forgetfulness from beginning to end, the spleen and will are perfected.

Perfection leads to enrollment in the Orthodox Unity. Once united with the One, worries and anxieties no longer arise. The five desires are dispelled, the five evils naturally vanish, the five calamities are forever extinguished, the five sufferings are long departed, the Five Spirits are settled, and the five virtues spontaneously arise. The Three Fortunes flourish daily, and the Five Joys are ever renewed.

From the *Orthodox Unity Scriptures*

Here concludes Scroll Forty-Six of the *Supreme Secret Essentials*. Scroll Forty-Seven of the *Supreme Secret Essentials*: The Chapter on Fasting and Abstinence

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: In learning the Dao, fasting and abstinence are fundamental. Reciting scriptures requires fasting; collating scriptures requires fasting; copying scriptures requires fasting; inscribing talismans requires fasting; engraving registers requires fasting; compounding the Golden Elixir requires fasting; visiting a master to seek instruction requires fasting; performing rites of worship requires fasting; receiving scriptures requires fasting; healing illness and dispelling calamity require fasting; summoning Perfected Ones requires fasting.

Fasting is revered by the Most High, cherished by Lord Lao, and relied upon by all the Sages. There are many methods of fasting, which depend on what the practitioner has received and cultivates.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: When a person fasts in purity and stillness for a long time, concentrating the spirit and immersing in the mysterious, reciting scriptures to repent of sins, burning incense and performing rites of worship, they will see flying immortals descending, and jade maidens and immortal youths appearing before them. Sometimes they may hear praise from the void, or see light and shadows illuminating their body, or hear the sounds of gold and jade, the music of the eight timbres—all signs that their Dao is about to be accomplished. Be diligent, be diligent! The Most High will not fail you. The only concern is that you may not persevere, not see it through to the end; this is why the path to immortality is difficult.

From the *Hidden Commentary on the Cavernous Mystery and Great Ultimate Scripture*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: Always bear in mind fasting, chanting scriptures, and practicing great compassion. Put others before yourself, promote goodness and transform evil, sever all entanglements, extinguish thoughts and guard emptiness. Let the heart be like the Great Mystery, seeking only the Dao—only then can one be said to speak of the way of divine immortals.

From the *Cavernous Mystery Scripture on Pacifying the Will and Dispelling Demons*

Lord Lao the Most High said: Among the priorities of Daoists, none is closer than fasting. There are many methods of fasting, largely similar with minor differences. The most meritorious is the Fasting of the Most High Numinous Treasure, though it is rarely practiced in the world. Those who study it are all great beings, whose accumulated blessings from past lives bring them close to immortality. There is also the Fasting of the Three Heavens, which resembles the Numinous Treasure method.

The Immortal Duke said: The Fasting of the Three Heavens is the method received by the Masters of the Three Heavens, called the *Scripture of the Decreed Teachings*, and is somewhat secondary. Yet the celestial scriptures are vast and wondrous, beyond the contemplation of worldly worthies. Those who master them are all upper immortals and Perfected Ones, mystically one with the Most High. Thus, even middle immortals and heavenly beings cannot fathom their meaning—they merely glimpse the words without understanding, so what more can be said?

Lord Lao the Most High said: Fasting in purity, reciting scriptures, cultivating virtue, and establishing merit—these alone can accomplish the immortal Dao. Why must one retreat to mountains and marshes? The aim is simply to avoid desires and depart from filth and chaos; the mountains and forests do not exclusively harbor those who possess the Dao.

From the *Cavernous Mystery Scripture of Questions to the Highest*

The Immortal Duke ascended Mount Laosheng, fasting in stillness and contemplating the Dao. At midday, thirty-three earthbound immortals and Daoist adepts arrived at his seat. After burning incense and paying homage to the scriptures, each returned to their immortal abodes, dwelling in peace as before.

The Immortal Duke said: The Celestial Master has said that those who fast in a quiet chamber on the first and fifteenth days of the month, reading the scriptures they have received and the deeds of the immortals, will all become people of future sages, born to encounter this age—how joyful is that?

From the *Cavernous Mystery Scripture of the Difficulties of All Sages*

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dao is revered, its methods wondrous, and the human body is also precious. Thus, the Dao has revealed scriptures, precepts, and teachings to deliver the human form. Once the human form is delivered, it ascends to become one with the Dao. One should practice purity, uphold fasting and precepts, calm the mind in stillness, keep the will and thoughts clear, focus the intent single-mindedly, and maintain unwavering concentration. Purify the six viscera, refrain from eating after midday, keep inner and outer purity, and align with spontaneity—this is the fasting where one kneads incense and voices aspirations, which ascend to the heavens. The patrols of the Four Heavens and the mighty spirits of the Ten Divisions descend to observe and listen. The sounds of the Dharma illuminate, and if your heart adheres to the precepts, your practice will be recorded as merit in the heavens. Fortune and misfortune will be immediately manifest, for the Dao does not fail people.

The Heavenly Worthy said: When establishing a fast and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings all ride flying clouds, green chariots, and eight-scene jade carriages. Perfected Ones and jade maidens attend them, holding flowered canopies. Phoenixes sing in the lead, celestial music follows, white cranes and lions roar and chant. Fragrant smoke wafts, flowers scatter in the air as they come to witness the rites, observe the practice, and listen to the sounds of the Dharma. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage.

From the *Cavernous Mystery Scripture of the Great Precepts of Wisdom and Intelligence*

At that time, the Dao Lord of the Most High was at the Cypress Mound Lodge in the Southern Vermilion Cavern of Yang. He bowed his head and paid homage to the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, reflecting on the blessings of past lives that, through the connections of countless kalpas, had allowed him to encounter this sagely and luminous age. Formerly, he had been elevated by revelation, undeservedly honored, and favored by the Upper Perfected Ones, who instructed him in the Three Treasures and the divine scriptures, bestowed upon him the Great Precepts, and proclaimed the sounds of the Dharma. The joy of such excessive grace was boundless. Since receiving these teachings, he had fasted in empty mountains, upheld the precepts and commandments without negligence or weariness. His Daoist practice was accomplished, enabling him to deliver all heavenly and mortal beings, men and women, and universally reveal the gates of the Dharma.

From the *Cavernous Mystery Scripture of the Precepts on the Roots of Transgressions*

The Dao said: Once there was a Daoist who fasted and recited scriptures. A layman was hired to clean and prepare the fasting hall. The Daoist, seeing his diligence, at midday invited him to share the fast and eat together. After the meal, he expounded the Dharma to the laborer, telling him to join in fasting. The merit of this is vast—come again at midday tomorrow to eat, and do not break your fast, lest your efforts be in vain and without benefit. If you can do this, you may avoid poverty and hardship in this life.

The laborer bowed and received the precepts before leaving. That evening, he returned home, where his wife had prepared a meal, awaiting her husband’s return. He explained the Daoist’s precepts to her, but she did not understand and became angry. Unable to resist his wife’s wishes, the laborer broke his fast and ate with her. Later, when his life ended, the celestial officials made him the master of a thousand-year-old tree spirit in Mount Shu, forever providing for his sustenance.

The tree flourished in lush abundance. One sweltering summer day, three diligent and virtuous seekers passed by and rested beneath its shade. One of them sighed, saying, "Though this tree provides cool respite, the sun has already reached its zenith—how shall we find food?" From within the hollow of the tree, a voice replied, "I shall prepare a midday meal for you, noble ones. Have no concern." In an instant, food appeared, and the seekers ate together. After the meal, one said, "Where now shall we seek the Dao? Is this very spontaneity not the Dao itself?" They then asked the tree, "Might the great spirit deign to briefly descend and appear before us?" The voice from the hollow answered, "I am not one who can guide others to the Dao." It then revealed its name and origin, explaining, "I was once a laborer urged by a Daoist to keep the fast. My wife broke my resolve, leaving my merit incomplete. Thus, I am bound to guard this tree spirit, unable to depart. Heaven, recalling my past observance of the midday fast, now provides me with daily sustenance. Though my mouth and belly are sated, I remain trapped here without hope of advancement. I humbly ask, noble ones, to visit my home and explain my plight. If you could perform a three-day fast and purification on my behalf, I would ascend at once."

Moved by the spirit’s plea, the seekers sought out his family and relayed his words. His kin then arranged a fast, inviting Daoist priests to burn incense, recite scriptures, and offer three days of repentance. The spirit immediately took flight, ascending into the clouds, where it received a celestial writ and became a wandering immortal in the radiant heavens. Thus, the merit of fasting is profound and must not be neglected. This man, though he kept the fast for only half a day and died the following day, was freed from his bond and attained immortality within a year. Heaven’s reckoning of merit and transgression is precise and unerring. Those who pursue the Dao must diligently observe fasting and precepts, awaiting the hidden response; those who cultivate this practice will surely achieve ascension.

*—Excerpt from the* Wondrous Scripture of Fundamental Practices *(*Dongxuan Benxing Miaojing*)*

When the Left Immortal of the Grand Ultimate, Lord Taiyi, secluded himself in fasting and purification on Mount Tiantai to repent his sins, he burned incense, confessed his transgressions, and meditated upon the true Dao. For a hundred days, divine luminaries flickered in the void above—now present, now absent, now soaring, now gathering—casting shifting reflections upon the hall of fasting. The Immortal’s gaze pierced the depths, and his distant devotion moved the celestial perfected. Thereupon, he refined his thoughts upon the mysterious work, his resolve growing ever more steadfast. Before a year had passed, his devotion resonated with the exalted sages, who descended in subtle regard to his secluded chamber. On the night of the *gengyin* day in the first month of the new year, there suddenly appeared flying clouds from the cinnabar heavens, eight radiant scenes, jade chariots, jeweled canopies, streaming effulgence, celestial incense, and drifting blossoms—all floating in the void. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders arrived, beyond all reckoning.

Upon first entering the fast hall, the Dharma Master leads, followed by the officials in order. Each holds three pinches of incense, circumambulating the high seat once to the left. Facing east, they knock their teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Three Heavens’ True Primordial Three Qi,
Most High Lord Lao,
Summon forth from within us
the Three and Five Functionaries,
Left and Right Official Envoys,

may the Most High’s Ten Directions’ Orthodox True Vital Qi
enter our bodies,
so our petitions swiftly ascend
before the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Ultimate Great Dao’s

*(From the* Scripture of Illuminating the True.*)*

Next, the petition ritual.

**Petition of the Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Peerless Cavern-Mystery Disciples, Master [X] of [Y] Mountain, [Name] and Others:**

We, your disciples, humbly address the Supreme Ultimate Great Dao Most True, the Numinous Treasure’s Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Three Supreme Ones, the Multitudes of Saints in the Ten Directions, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Realm, the Officials and Attendants of the Three Realms, and all divine spirits:

By fortunate karmic affinity, the blessings of our past lives and the nine heavens’ kalpas have extended to our present selves. We have encountered this luminous era, wherein the Great Dharma flourishes, allowing our defiled forms to partake in the sacred texts—the Golden Writings of the Upper Clarity and the Three Caverns’ Treasure Scriptures. We have reverently offered them devotion, observed precepts, and performed purification rites. The grace bestowed is profound, the favors weighty—far beyond our deserts.

Yet we, base and unrefined, have failed to ascend the numinous peaks or refine our hearts and spirits. Instead, we have indulged in worldly glory, lingering among mortals, drifting with the times, and sinking with the mundane tide. Our transgressions and faults have accumulated day by day, month by month. We constantly fear the reckoning to come, shamed before the hidden and obscure. Day and night, we tremble as if treading thin ice. Rightly should we remain silent in our inadequacy, yet on the day we received the Dharma, we swore oaths before the Three Officials: we vowed to devote even the slightest of our meager efforts to glorify the Great Transformation, making salvation our vocation.

Now, with reverence, we present our fellow Daoists—men and women of [X] prefecture, [Y] county, [Z] village, [Name], aged [X] years—who have composed their petitions and listed their vows, surrendering their lives to the Great Dao. They have prepared the rites of incense and lamps for offerings, seeking to undertake the purification rites of [X] office. How dare we not report this? We shall now perform the Peerless Great Dharma and the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Purification Rite, equivalent to a thousand days and nights. Beginning on the [X] day of this month, we shall gather together at [Location], purify ourselves according to the Dharma, and proceed with due solemnity.

We hereby announce this, adhering to the ancient protocols of ritual decorum, appointing officials and functionaries, proclaiming the precepts and prohibitions, that all officers and attendants may submit to the Dharma’s teachings.

We implore the Supreme Ones, the Three Treasures’ majestic spirits, the Dharma Masters overseeing the purification, and the attendant perfected beings: deign to look upon us with compassion, review our petition, and command the officials of the Three Realms and the local earth deities to guard and protect us, our households, and all within our dwellings. Cleanse our abodes, dispel malevolent impurities, and at dawn tomorrow, we shall perform the Dao according to the Dharma, continuing our supplications.

*(From the* Scripture of the Golden Register.*)*

The petition concluded, all face east and stand in alignment, reciting the Three Stanzas of Wisdom:

**First Stanza:**
Wisdom arises from the formless,
Radiant, transcending the Ten Directions.
It structures emptiness, towering in the Mysterious Empyrean,
While all heavens embrace its fragrant flow.
Its wonders defy thought,
Yet through emptiness, truth is realized.
Existence holds no true existence,
And non-existence contains all.

**Second Stanza:**
Wisdom ever observes the self,
The foremost study of those who cultivate the Dao.
Subtly it enters the Mysterious Workshop,
Naturally recording our spirits.
The Heavenly Worthy ever shields us,
While demon kings pledge their protection.
Resplendent is the Vajra body,
Transcendent, a Supreme Immortal.

**Third Stanza:**
Wisdom births the root of precepts,
For the true Dao, precepts are the foundation.
From them arise the Three Treasures,
Revered by lofty sages.
Aboard this deathless vessel,
Swiftly we cross the vast expanse.
At this moment of preaching precepts,
All heavens bow in homage.

*(From the* Jade Register of Pure Sincerity.*)*

**Next, the Dharma Master Faces East, Toward the West, and Proclaims the Precepts:**

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord, saying: “Now we shall universally proclaim the Dharma’s sound to awaken all beings. For all men and women, we shall dissolve calamities, avert misfortunes, invoke blessings, deliver lives, and eradicate the roots of suffering. May the living perceive the Dao, escape the eight difficulties, and may the dead rejoice, feasting in the heavens, soon reborn among men, ascending to the ranks of sagely kings. All who perform purification rites and seek the Dao must wholeheartedly receive and uphold the Ten Precepts. Listen attentively, without distraction, and contemplate their truth naturally. Do not allow stray thoughts to disturb body and spirit. Those who can do so shall now listen in silence:

**First Precept:** Let the heart harbor no malice or envy. Do not cultivate hidden harm. Guard your speech, be cautious of faults, and let your thoughts dwell in the Dharma.

**Second Precept:** Uphold benevolence, refrain from killing. Pity and aid all beings. Let compassion and love extend broadly to save all, bestowing blessings universally.

**Third Precept:** Uphold chastity and yield to righteousness. Do not indulge in lust or theft. Constantly cultivate good thoughts, sacrificing for others.

**Fourth Precept:** Do not indulge in sensuality or desire, nor act wantonly. Maintain purity and caution, ensuring your conduct remains unstained.

**Fifth Precept:** Let your speech be free of malice. Do not adorn your words with florid embellishments. Be upright in all matters, avoiding transgressions of speech.

**Sixth Precept:** Reduce alcohol and moderate conduct. Harmonize your qi and nature. Do not injure the spirit or commit manifold evils.

**Seventh Precept:** Do not envy others’ superiority or contend for fame. In all matters, yield and retreat, aiding others in their advancement.

**Eighth Precept:** Do not criticize the scriptures or slander sacred texts. Receive the Dharma with reverence, ever as if in the presence of the divine.

**Ninth Precept:** Do not incite strife or gossip, nor disparage the four classes. Heaven and humanity will resent you, harming your spirit and qi.

**Tenth Precept:** In all actions and deeds, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people, and peace among spirits. Let this be your constant practice.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who cultivate and uphold the pure precepts ever align with the heart of Heaven. Constantly practice great compassion, vowing to universally deliver all from calamity and distress. With reverence for the sacred teachings, never grow lax midway. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Thus unwavering, one may escape the Five Paths and avoid the Three Evils. Guarded by all heavens and revered by the myriad spirits, through long fasting and precept-keeping, one naturally attains deliverance from the world.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dao is exalted, the Dharma wondrous, and the human body likewise precious. Thus the Dao unfolds the Dharma, bequeathing precepts and scriptures to deliver the human form. Once the human form is delivered, it ascends to merge with the Dao. One should therefore practice with utmost sincerity, maintain fasting and precepts, calm the mind in stillness, and clarify intentions. With single-minded devotion and undivided focus, purify the Six Bowels. After midday, take no flavor. Within and without, remain pure and empty, ever in accord with nature. On fasting days, when incense is lit and vows are made, the invocation ascends to the Four Heavens. The ten divisions of mighty spirits then descend, observing conduct and listening to the Dharma. The sounds of the Dharma oversee and reflect. If your heart adheres to the precepts and you practice the Dao, your merits shall be recorded in the heavens. Fortune and misfortune manifest instantly. The Dao does not fail those who diligently practice and sincerely receive—beware the words of demons.

The Heavenly Worthy said: When establishing fasts and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings all ride jade chariots of eight luminous scenes drawn by flying clouds. Attended by perfected beings and jade maidens bearing floral banners, they are preceded by phoenix songs and followed by the celestial harmonies of the Grand Heaven. White cranes and lions roar and chant, while fragrant smoke wafts and flowers scatter through the air. They come to witness the practice of the Dao, to listen to the Dharma, and to pay homage. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits gather in attendance. How could one not fully uphold such a method?

First receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Move with refined grace, quiet the heart, and still the mind. In sitting, rising, lying, or resting, never depart from proper form. The Heavenly Kings rejoice, and your name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity. This is what it means to attain the Dao within the square inch of the heart.

From the *Scripture of Ritual Fast Procedures*.
After the articles are proclaimed, each pays homage to the master with two bows. Then the master faces east, kneels, and formally requests the officials to assume their posts.

The Most High Numinous Treasure’s Supreme Three Caverns Disciples, Master So-and-So of Such-and-Such Mountain and So-and-So, humbly address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Supreme Dao Lord of the Boundless Great Dao, the August Jade Sovereign, the Perfected and Great Sages who have attained the Dao, the Host of Most True Ones, the Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Void Highest Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, the Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous, the Northern Perfected, the Golden Towers of the Jade Metropolis of the Dark Capital, the Seven-Treasured Mystic Terrace, the Supreme Palace of the Purple Tenuity, the Most True Ones of the Numinous Treasure, the Radiant Sovereign of the Dao, and all others:

By karmic affinity from past lives, we have been born to encounter the transformation of the Dao. Through the mysterious and true, we have been awakened and uplifted, entering the root of faith. Our former masters have transmitted to us the sacred scriptures of the Three Treasures through covenant. In reverent offering and homage, we prioritize the establishment of merit. Now, from such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, the man or woman So-and-So has submitted a petition and come forth in person. With sincere and earnest hearts, we beseech your compassionate review and humbly present the petition for proclamation. We reverently recite the petition’s text.

Upon proclaiming the petition, we, in accordance with its words—its earnest and pressing matters, which evoke profound pity—find ourselves unable to bear witness without acting. Thus, we join together, purify ourselves through bathing, burn incense, light lamps, and circumambulate the Dao. Following the ritual, we invoke and supplicate the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Earthbound Immortals, Perfected Ones, Divine Persons, Sages, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Overseers of the Ritual Fast, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers, the Thirty-Two Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, the Messengers Transmitting Words and Memorials, the Flying Dragon Riders, and all others—requesting their united descent to oversee the ritual hall. As we hold incense and voice our vows, may our prayers ascend without obstruction. Upon the completion of the circumambulation, we petition for their return to the immortal palaces.

From the *Scripture of Radiant Perfection*.

Next, the Rite of Replenishing the Censer:
May the Incense Officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and the various spirit officials attending the incense ensure that within this hall of stillness, golden liquor, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and numinous herbs spontaneously arise. May the host of perfected ones and the hundred spirits gather here before the incense fire. May we, the supplicants, receive blessings under heaven and be favored across the ten directions. May the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attend the incense smoke, transmitting our words directly to the presence of the Supreme Boundless Dao.

From the *Scripture of Radiant Perfection*.

Next, the Offering of the Precepts and Hymn.

The Dao is the school of no-mind,
the field where all merit is sown.
To establish merit has no fixed master—
each follows their own original vow.
Empty the self to respond to all beings,
direct the mind so none is left unmet.
The Great Sage exalts the supreme teaching,
just as rain falls from heaven:
high and low alike receive it,
yet the lowly become deep pools.
The sea is king of the hundred rivers,
for it contains dragons and scaled creatures.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom is preserved and used—
how could it be limited to one’s years?
Uphold the precepts without the slightest lapse,
and in life after life, good affinities will form.
With focused thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
and you shall embody the true Dao.

From the *Scripture of the Divine Duke’s Inquiry*.

Next, the Spell for Opening the Dao-Gate:
Darkest Supreme Yin, the eight windows open bright.
When there is something to report, the Maiden transmits the numinous.
Once the matter is complete, the ten thousand spirits return to their tranquil harbor.

From the *Scripture of the Golden Register*.

Here ends Scroll Forty-Eight of the *Supreme Secret Essentials*.

Scroll Forty-Nine of the *Supreme Secret Essentials*
The Three Sovereigns’ Fast

The numinous altar shall be twenty-four feet square, with four gates opened at the directions of chen, xu, chou, and wei. Within the altar, nine lamps shall be arranged in each of the four directions. Opposite the altar, set one tray and one cup for the offering. The cups used shall each hold one sheng. On the tray, place three jujubes and nine slices of dried meat. The total for one offering shall be nine sheng of wine and twenty-seven jujubes.

One censer of incense shall be burned.

Each of the Three Sovereigns’ seats shall have one table: the Heavenly Sovereign at zi, the Earthly Sovereign at shen, and the Human Sovereign at yin. Each shall have one tray, one cup, one offering mat, and one censer. Each cup shall hold three sheng of wine, and each tray nine jujubes. The three seats together shall use nine sheng of wine and twenty-seven jujubes.

Three azure banners shall be prepared, each five feet long. On each, write in vermilion the inner script of the Three Sovereigns, adjusting the size and spacing of the characters to fill the banner. Attach ribbons as above. Three green bamboo poles, each twelve feet long, shall be fitted with bases and placed behind each table at their respective positions.

At the center of the altar, place another incense table and censer, with the silk of the fast’s patron’s life-destiny spread upon the table.

One candle tray with a stand and three candles shall be provided for reading the scriptures and turning during the rite.

Spread mats to cover the altar. In total, eight censers, four tables, incense and lamps as prescribed, thirty-nine seven-inch trays, thirty-nine sheng cups, and two sets of seven libation vessels shall be used to hold the jujubes and dried meat prepared for the day.

For one day, use forty-five sheng of wine, one hundred thirty-five jujubes, and forty-five jin of dried meat. For three days, use one *dan* and thirty-five sheng of wine, four hundred five jujubes, and one hundred thirty-five jin of dried meat.

Prepare the incense according to the method for Upper Prime Fragrant Pearls, and refine cloud-fat for anointing. Bathe with cloud-water; if in a place of poverty, plain fragrant water will suffice. Five-fold incense and fresh clear oil are also acceptable.

Thirty-six lamp wicks shall be prepared, and lamps may also be lit at the kitchen stove and other places as available.

Offerings of faith.

The patron’s life-destiny silk shall be one *chi* in length, its color corresponding to the patron’s birth year. For the Heavenly Sovereign, nine *zhang* of black silk; for the Earthly Sovereign, seven *zhang* of white silk; for the Human Sovereign, seven *zhang* of azure silk. For the poor, these may be reduced to *chi* lengths, while wealthy households may provide more.

Also, spread one bolt of silk in each direction on the exposed mats to serve as seats for the deities: azure in the east, crimson in the south, white in the west, and black in the north—two in each direction, with additional ones placed at the gates.

According to the scripture, this fast should be observed with meals taken at the hours of *zi* and *wu*. However, most people today cannot adhere to this and follow the usual practice. Only at midnight, after the ritual circumambulation, shall the offering be presented at the seats, and all shall receive blessings. Any surplus may be distributed as desired.

For devout household members, though the rite is prescribed for three days, it may be completed in one day and night. In impoverished mountain regions, the offering may be omitted, and only lamps lit.

Here ends the list of items required for the fast.

The ritual implements, four banners, and mats shall be provided by the ritual master. Incense, oil, and offerings of faith shall be provided by the patron of the fast. After the rite, these shall be distributed as alms.

The preliminary rite on the eve of the fast:
If wind or rain drives one indoors, face north, knock the teeth twelve times, and say:

Fragrant smoke and jade maidens ascend to memorialize the Three August Sovereigns and the True Lords, reporting the establishment of the Three Augusts’ Daoist Fast of the Cavernous Divine for the thirty-six matters, with gratitude. Now, as we ascend the altar and enter the chamber to burn incense, may this eve’s preliminary rite be heard this very day, proceeding directly to the Purple Palace, and reaching upward to the presence of the Three August True Lords.

Thereupon, we offer incense and bow twice. Again, we present incense at the three thrones: to the Heavenly August at *zi*, the Earthly August at *shen*, and the Human August at *yin*. Thrice we bow and stand, saying:

We, your servants, now burn incense and perform this rite of reverence, wishing that by this merit we may offer it above for the king, the imperial lord, the dukes, ministers, and common folk, the prefects and magistrates of the commanderies, the assembled officials and all offices, and for our own living and deceased parents; below, may it extend to ourselves, the black-haired masses, the myriad people, the hidden souls of the earthly prisons, the spirits of mountains and waters, the essences of birds, beasts, fish, and insects, and all sentient beings. May each attain their Dao, have their accumulated transgressions pardoned, their trials and grievances resolved, their names inscribed on the cinnabar tablets, and their destinies fixed in the azure registers.

May we, your servants, together with the deities of the Three Palaces, ascend the Mystic Dawn, present ourselves at the Supreme Clarity, and behold the Sage Lord. May we be granted scriptures and receive our duties, forever becoming lofty perfected ones.

Still reciting, they say:

Vast, vast, the qi of the Three Heavens,
Nurturing and fostering the myriad transformations of things.
Worldly passions delight in their blossoms,
Yet the true Dao treasures their essence.
The foolish and vulgar play with fleeting glory,
While divine immortals cherish the fundamental substance.
Diligently cultivating the scriptures of the Three Sovereigns,
Jade spirits illumine the secluded chamber.
In lofty song, we aspire to the Supreme Microcosm,
Bowing our heads to pay homage to the August One.

Again they bow twice, each declaring their name and rank:

Disciples of the Supreme Perfected Three Sovereigns, your servants so-and-so, respectfully address the Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, the Jade Lords of the Three Sovereigns, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Elders, the Immortal Officials of the Mystic Capital, the Supreme Mystic Perfected Spirits, the Divine Officials of the Thirty-Six Heavens above and below, the Spirits of the Great Clarity, the Celestial Emperors of the Five Directions, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Stellar Officials within and beyond, the Perfected Officials of the Five Marchmounts, the Assisting Spirits of all mountains, the Four Seas, the Four Rivers, the Eight Marshes, the Nine Springs, the renowned mountains and grotto-heavens, the water spirits, and all the myriad numinous beings within the cosmos.

We, your servants, have performed meritorious deeds in past lives, and in this present existence, our karma has inclined toward emptiness and distance, our understanding still pure and true. Thus, we have been able to transcend the mundane form and dwell beyond the forest of light, serving the Dao and contemplating the Mysterious. Years and months have passed in this manner. Though we have not yet attained wisdom to penetrate the profound origin or radiance to illumine the wondrous ultimate, we have fixed our thoughts upon the numinous spirits without fail.

From of old, we have received the inner scriptures of the Three Sovereigns, the celestial writings of jade graphs, which above can inscribe names among the myriad spirits and seal the palms of the host of numina, and below can rescue and resolve calamities, swiftly bestowing blessings and felicity.

There are the precious fasts and registers for supplication and thanksgiving, the inner formulas of the immortal capital revealing the rites of the jiao offering. The incense of the Upper Prime wafts through the vast heavens, the vermilion lamps of the Mysterious Numinous illumine the deep night. Truly, this is the secret transmission for attaining the sagely, the essential method for summoning the perfected. Its vast salvation extends to the four quarters, unbound by nobility or baseness; its vast moisture permeates the eight directions, undivided between Daoists and commoners.

Now, so-and-so of such-and-such commandery, district, village, and hamlet, having faith in the true canon and aspiring to merit and fortune, has journeyed afar to this mountain to present his plea. With sincere devotion, he seeks to establish the Three Sovereigns’ fast of thanksgiving, to repent misfortune and pray for blessings.

We respectfully recite the words to make them heard, aligning the petition with the proper forms and sincerity of intent. We, your servants, who assist the world and rescue the imperiled, are duty-bound to aid and deliver. So-and-so, overwhelmed by utmost sincerity, has humbly led us here. Having bathed in the numinous waters and purified ourselves, on such-and-such day of this month, we shall together ascend the numinous altar, enter the fast hall, and lodge our supplication. For three days and three nights, through the twelve hours, we shall perform the Dao, conduct rites, and present offerings, making our report to the Upper Palace.

We humbly pray that the Perfected Officials of the August One’s Three Perfected Grotto-Heavens deign to oversee and inspect. May they specially command the Perfected Officials and true spirits of the commandery, district, village, and hamlet, the various attending perfected officers, the soldiers, the incense and jade maidens, and the supervising altar spirits to jointly protect and defend the fast site, slay and sever demonic influences, so that the heavens may be clear and the qi bright, the winds may sweep and the clouds disperse. May our merit be accomplished and our affairs fulfilled, and may all be worthy of reward for their toil.

The rites and protocols shall be made clear at the dawn audience.

Thereupon, they bow twice more, turn, and proceed, reciting:

Those who cultivate the supreme Dao in the world
harbor myriad thoughts in their hearts and minds.
Their ears and eyes are distracted by gaudy hues,
and their emotions and wills remain ever unsteady.
Though petty wisdom may strive with its own strength,
how can it safeguard one’s life to the end?
The five spirits lose their master,
and true qi departs, never to return.
If one can practice with a suffering heart,
one may preserve life and secure its root.
Hold the precepts as your treasure,
and ever grasp the words of the Heavenly Elder.
All the Perfected will rejoice together,
and together they will welcome the August Lord.

Facing southeast, they turn west and kneel, saying:
We, your servants, humbly reflect upon ourselves.
Though we have fully heard the teachings of the Dao
and received the established rules in their entirety,
we have yet to still our minds and open our thoughts,
so that all leaks might instantly vanish.
We must redouble our efforts to perfect our true work.
Now we reverently unfold the scriptures, expound the prohibitions,
and instruct those of shared qi.
We explain and confer the duties to be undertaken,
so that each may follow the canonical offices.
We request that the fast officers prostrate themselves to receive the command.

We respectfully follow the words of the Supreme Minister, the Perfected One of the Western City, Lord Wang:
The August Scriptures of Heavenly Writ
are the great chapters of the cloud-seal of the Supreme Perfected One of the Three Sovereigns,
received in the time of the Three August Ones.
When the Three Sovereigns established their work,
heaven was harmonious and earth was uncarved.
They ordered yin and yang,
and regulated ghosts and spirits.
Thus could they nurture the body and secure life,
preserving and prolonging it.
These are the secret treasures of the Queen Mother of the West,
the objects of reverence for the immortals’ officials—
truly the precious texts of the Perfected.
Few in the world obtain these scriptures.
If one can possess them,
the Nine Elder Immortals of the Great Mystery’s Immortal Capital
will dispatch direct talismans to guard this true writ.
Simply by paying reverence morning and evening,
one may enjoy one’s full span of years,
and the five weapons, five poisons, and baleful influences will not assail one.
If one could summon by means of them, how could their power be described?
The calamity of careless disclosure and disrespect
is met with celestial statutes and punitive decrees.
The August One records transgressions in writing—
how can one not be cautious!

The Perfected One of the Western City further says:
The pursuit of fame is the name that destroys my virtue.
The pursuit of affairs is the affair that disorders my work.
The pursuit of desire is the desire that increases my confusion.
The pursuit of emotion is the emotion that destroys my self.
No sin is greater than lewdness,
no calamity greater than greed,
no fault greater than gluttony.
These are the vehicles that carry disaster:
in small measure, they endanger the body;
in great measure, they ruin the household.

The Perfected Lord Wang further admonishes:
Those who wish to study the Dao and seek life
must first be cautious of all prohibitions.
Only then can they commune with the divine luminaries
and thus forever preserve body and life.
If one repeatedly violates and offends,
one will be seized by the dark bureaus.
Even to remain human will be impossible—
how much more so to become an immortal?
Now I tell you these things—
you must uphold them.

The first prohibition: Do not indulge in lewdness or ejaculation,
lest your body and life perish prematurely.
The second prohibition: Do not secretly harm or cruelly oppress,
lest the Three Offices execute punishment.
The third prohibition: Do not kill or injure living beings,
lest the dead and living seize you in retribution.
The fourth prohibition: Do not slander, envy, or deceive,
lest humans and ghosts bring you harm.
The fifth prohibition: Do not steal or cheat,
lest your conduct be degraded and diminished.
The sixth prohibition: Do not grieve, sorrow, or brood,
lest your essence and spirit become confused.
The seventh prohibition: Do not rage or indulge in excess,
lest your spirit scatter and disperse.
The eighth prohibition: Do not become drunk or licentious,
lest the Three Palaces collapse in chaos.
The ninth prohibition: Do not eat the five pungents or bloody flesh,
lest your viscera become foul and putrid.
The tenth prohibition: Do not suffer hunger, satiety, cold, or heat,
lest the hundred diseases attack and congeal.
The eleventh prohibition: Do not speak or laugh excessively,
lest your spirit and qi be depleted.
The twelfth prohibition: Do not gaze or listen for too long,
lest your ears and eyes become dim and clouded.
The thirteenth prohibition: Do not be filthy, negligent, or indolent,
lest your form and spirit become ugly and perverse.

These thirteen prohibitions are the great perils of the human body.
Uphold them, and you will live;
violate them, and you will die.
As Laozi said: “Those who follow life are thirteen;
those who follow death are thirteen.”
Does this not refer to these?
What is light is called a precept;
what is weighty is called a prohibition.
Prohibitions and precepts are the excellent prescriptions for aiding the body.
For those who study immortality, prohibitions and precepts are their armor.
Though they enter the three armies, blades and arrows cannot harm them.
Though they dwell in the world, disasters and misfortunes cannot enter.
Truly, these words are clear—let each be exhorted by them!

Thereupon, they read the tablets and confer the duties.

Upon completion, they rise and turn toward the incense burner, saying:
"Fragrant smoke and jade maidens, attending officials of the present watch—let it now be known that upon this dew-altar and within this hall of purification, hidden zhi-fungus and jade essence abide before this incense lamp. May we, your servants, attain immortality, our bodies adorned with purple networks and feathered patterns; may our households enjoy blessings, and all under heaven rejoice as one. O jade maidens who attend the altar and hall, transmit our words to the Three August Sovereigns."

Following the ritual, they ascend the altar, make their procession, and stand facing north. They knock their teeth thirty-six times and recite the *Shejing Invocation*:

Vast and boundless,
I seal the celestial writ on high.
I receive the divine script,
opening my address to the Three August Ones.
To the west, I tread the Golden Gate;
to the east, I ascend Fusang.
To the north, I traverse the Dark Yin;
to the south, I ride the True Yang.
Advancing, I mount the Great Horn;
retreating, I tread upon Wen Chang.
I wander between Kui and Lou,
roam and feast in the chambers of Shen and Fang.
I enter to serve the jade maidens;
I depart, escorting the Immortal Kings.
With heaven I share longevity;
with the sun I merge radiance.
The twenty-five qi sweep away misfortune and calamity.

They then knock their teeth twelve times and recite the invocation:

Fragrant smoke and jade maidens,
ascend to memorialize the Three August Sovereigns, the thirty-six celestial immortals, and the divine officials. The humble male servant, so-and-so, respectfully establishes the Cavernous-Dao Three August Ones Retreat for such-and-such prefecture, county, and matter. We now request your proper ascent to the altar, entry into the chamber, the burning of incense, and the opening of the rite. May this day’s petition swiftly ascend to the Purple Palace and be reverently presented before the Three August Sovereigns.

Upon offering the incense, they bow twice and say:
Your servant, having purified himself in retreat and severed worldly dust, burns incense and offers gratitude. On behalf of my seven generations of ancestors and parents, extending to my entire household, I beseech forgiveness for accumulated transgressions and bound sins, the dissolution of trials and lawsuits, the inscription of names upon the cinnabar tablets, and the fixing of characters upon the azure scrolls. May your servant, together with the gods of the Three Palaces, ascend the Mystic Dawn, attend the court of Supreme Clarity, behold the Sacred Sovereign, receive sacred writ and office, and forever become a lofty perfected one.

First, they pour the Celestial Sovereign’s wine.
Having done so, they bow twice and say:
Your servant now reverently invokes the Primordial Three Mysteries of the Void, the Heavenly Stem Jia-Zi, and the Original Sovereign of the Celestial August One. May you deign to descend and partake.

They continue:
Your servant, having purified himself in retreat and severed worldly dust, establishes the Cavernous-Dao Three August Ones Retreat for so-and-so, offering gratitude. Through this rite of pacing the Dao, burning incense, and presenting offerings, we sincerely implore the descent of the Primordial Three Mysteries’ true qi of the Celestial August One. For so-and-so’s person, we beseech the dissolution of all transgressions from past lives down to the present—offenses against the suspended images of Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars; defilement and disrespect toward their radiance; wrathful winds and clouds; the destruction and abandonment of sacrifices; and all violations against the numinous spirits—amounting to one thousand two hundred categories of misdeeds, that they may all be dispelled and released. We pray that so-and-so’s fate be bound to the Celestial Bureau, their name inscribed in the Celestial Records, their life fixed upon the Celestial Tablet, their merits engraved upon the Celestial Pavilion. May all the gods of Heaven deign to shield and protect them, so that their illnesses be cured, their body become light and strong, their calamities be transcended, and their well-being preserved forever.

Next, they pour the Terrestrial Sovereign’s wine and bow twice, saying:
Your servant now reverently invokes the Three Primordials of Pure Numinosity, the Jade Heaven of the Celestial Stem Geng-Shen, and the Original Sovereign of the Terrestrial August One. May you deign to descend and partake.

They continue:
Your servant, having purified himself in retreat and severed worldly dust, establishes the Cavernous-Dao Three August Ones Retreat for so-and-so, offering gratitude. Through this rite of pacing the Dao, burning incense, and presenting offerings, we sincerely implore the descent of the Three Primordials’ true qi of Pure Numinosity of the Terrestrial August One, to come and assist so-and-so’s person. We beseech the dissolution of all transgressions from past lives down to the present—offenses against the essence of the Nine Earths of the Dark Land, the spirits of all hills, mountains, and water sources, metals, stones, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and insects, and all acts of killing—amounting to one thousand two hundred categories of misdeeds, that they may all be dispelled and released. We pray that so-and-so’s form be freed from the Earthly Bureau, their name erased from the Earthly Register, their po soul released from the Earthly Prison, and their spirit transcend the Earthly Realm. May all the gods of the Earth unite to shield and protect them, so that their illnesses be cured, their body become light and strong, their calamities be transcended, and their well-being preserved without end.

Finally, they pour the Human Sovereign’s wine.
Having done so, they bow twice and say:

Now I humbly invoke the Sevenfold Subtle, Vast and Profound, Empty Heaven’s Jia-Yin Void-Formed Human Sovereign True Unity Lord, praying that You deign to descend and partake of the offering.

Again, I say:
Having purified myself through fasting and cut off all worldly dust, I establish this Cavernous-Divine Three Sovereigns Retreat for so-and-so, and make this prayer of repentance. May the present rites of Dao, the burning of incense, and the offering of thanks be accepted.

The libation is poured, and with utmost sincerity I look up to summon the Human Sovereign’s Sevenfold Subtle, Vast and Profound true qi, that it may come to assist so-and-so’s person, beseeching the dissolution of all transgressions—from past lives down to the present—against human ethics, rites, loyalty, and filial piety; all sins of lewdness, greed, impurity, and falsehood; all faults of cruelty, oppression, and harm; and all offenses against gods and spirits. Amounting to one thousand two hundred categories of misdeeds, may they all be dispelled and released. We pray that so-and-so’s years surpass the human norm, their wisdom stand above others, their virtue uphold the human order, and their reputation fill the world’s gaze. May all the gods among humanity unite to aid and sustain them, so that their illnesses be cured, their body become light and strong, their calamities be transcended, and their well-being preserved without end.

Then, nine cups of wine are poured toward the east, and twice they bow, saying:
Now I humbly invoke the Divine Lords and Perfected Immortals of the Nine Heavens of the Eastern Realm, praying that You all deign to descend and partake of the offering.

Again, I say:
Having purified myself through fasting and cut off all worldly dust, I establish this Cavernous-Divine Three Sovereigns Retreat for so-and-so, and make this prayer of repentance. May the present rites of Dao, the burning of incense, and the offering of thanks be accepted.

The libation is poured, and with utmost sincerity I look up to summon the Nine Qi of the Eastern Nine Heavens’ Verdant Jade City, where the dawn’s rosy clouds descend, to assist so-and-so’s person, beseeching the dissolution of all offenses—from past lives down to the present—against the Lords of the Nine Heavens, the Year Star Wood Spirit, the Azure Dragon’s Seven Lodges, and all stellar officials within and beyond the heavens; and all violations against the Eastern Marchmount, mountains, hills, mounds, rivers, seas, streams, and valleys, and all spirits therein. For so-and-so, during the spring months of the year, on the days of Jia, Yi, Yin, Mao, and Chen, when their age and destiny clash with inauspicious stars, encountering harm from malevolent forces, calamities, illnesses, afflictions of noxious winds and poisonous influences, weakness, and all forms of ruin, downfall, and misfortune—may they all be dispelled and released. We pray that so-and-so’s person unite with the true qi in virtue, that radiant blessings flow like light, all misfortunes be extinguished, and their years and life be long.

Then, nine cups of wine are poured toward the north, and twice they bow, saying:
Now I humbly invoke the Divine Lords and Perfected Immortals of the Nine Heavens of the Northern Realm, praying that You all deign to descend and partake of the offering.

Again, I say:
Having purified myself through fasting and cut off all worldly dust, I establish this Cavernous-Divine Three Sovereigns Retreat for so-and-so, and make this prayer of repentance. May the present rites of Dao, the burning of incense, and the offering of thanks be accepted.

The libation is poured, and with utmost sincerity I look up to summon the Five Qi of the Northern Nine Heavens’ Dark Yin, Vast and Mysterious Palace, where flying mists descend, to assist so-and-so’s person, beseeching the dissolution of all offenses—from past lives down to the present—against the Lords of the Nine Heavens, the Chronographic Star Water Spirit, the Dark Warrior’s Seven Lodges, and all stellar officials within and beyond the heavens; and all violations against the Northern Marchmount, mountains, hills, mounds, rivers, seas, streams, and valleys, and all spirits therein. For so-and-so, during the winter months of the year, on the days and hours of Ren, Gui, Hai, Zi, and Chou, when their age and destiny clash with inauspicious stars, encountering harm from malevolent forces, calamities, illnesses, water swelling, diarrhea, blockages, distension, all afflictions of wind, and dangers of drowning—may they all be dispelled and released. We pray that so-and-so’s person unite with the true qi in virtue, that radiant blessings flow like light, all misfortunes be extinguished, and their years and life be long.

Then, nine cups of wine are poured toward the west, and twice they bow, saying:
Now I humbly invoke the Divine Lords and Perfected Immortals of the Nine Heavens of the Western Realm, praying that You all deign to descend and partake of the offering.

Again, I say:
Having purified myself through fasting and cut off all worldly dust, I establish this Cavernous-Divine Three Sovereigns Retreat for so-and-so, and make this prayer of repentance. May the present rites of Dao, the burning of incense, and the offering of thanks be accepted.

The libation is poured, and with utmost sincerity I look up to summon the Seven Qi of the Western Nine Heavens’ White Radiance, Vast and Resplendent Palace, where flowing light descends, to assist so-and-so’s person, beseeching the dissolution of all offenses—from past lives down to the present—against the Lords of the Nine Heavens, the Great White Metal Essence, the White Tiger’s Seven Lodges, and all stellar officials within and beyond the heavens; and all violations against the Western Marchmount, mountains, hills, mounds, rivers, seas, streams, and valleys, and all spirits therein. For so-and-so, during the autumn months of the year, on the days and hours of Geng, Xin, Jia, You, and Xu, when their age and destiny clash with inauspicious stars, encountering harm from malevolent forces, calamities, illnesses, and all dangers of blades, arrows, weapons, bandits, bloodshed, and bodily injury—may they all be dispelled and released. We pray that so-and-so’s person unite with the true qi in virtue, that radiant blessings flow like light, all misfortunes be extinguished, and their years and life be long.

Next, nine cups of wine are poured toward the south, and twice they bow, saying:
Now I humbly invoke the Divine Lords and Perfected Immortals of the Nine Heavens of the Southern Realm, praying that You all deign to descend and partake of the offering.

Again, I say:
Having purified myself through fasting and cut off all worldly dust, I establish this Cavernous-Divine Three Sovereigns Retreat for so-and-so, and make this prayer of repentance. May the present rites of Dao, the burning of incense, and the offering of thanks be accepted.

The libation is poured, and with utmost sincerity I look up to summon the Three Qi of the Southern Nine Heavens’ Vermilion Radiance, Cinnabar Terrace, where suspended light descends, to assist so-and-so’s person, beseeching the dissolution of all offenses—from past lives down to the present—against the Lords of the Nine Heavens, the Sparkling Deluder Fire Spirit, the Vermilion Bird’s Seven Lodges, and all stellar officials within and beyond the heavens; and all violations against the Southern Marchmount, mountains, hills, mounds, rivers, seas, streams, and valleys, and all spirits therein. For so-and-so, during the summer months of the year, on the days and hours of Bing, Ding, Ji, Wu, and Wei, when their age and destiny clash with inauspicious stars, encountering harm from malevolent forces, calamities, illnesses, ulcers, sores, fevers, epidemics, and all afflictions of heat, poison, and stings—may they all be dispelled and released. We pray that so-and-so’s person unite with the true qi in virtue, that radiant blessings flow like light, all misfortunes be extinguished, and their years and life be long.

When the four directions are complete, they recite:
The vast qi of the Three Heavens nurtures the myriad transformations.
Worldly sentiments delight in their blossoms, but the true Dao treasures their essence.
The foolish cling to fleeting glory, while immortals cherish the root.
With focused heart, I cultivate the Sovereign’s scriptures, and jade spirits illuminate the secluded chamber.
I chant high, awaiting the Great Subtlety, and bow my head to the Primordial Unity.

Then, they bow twice more. Turning again to face the north, they kneel and bow nine times, saying:

The humble disciples of the *Neijing* of the Three Sovereigns of the Cavernous Divine, petty subjects so-and-so and others, respectfully address and petition the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Jade Lords of the Three Sovereigns, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Elders, the Immortal Officials of the Dark Capital, the True Spirits of the Great Mystery, the divine administrators of the thirty-six heavens above and below, the Heavenly Emperors of the Five Directions, the various spirit officials of the Great Clarity, the stellar officials of the twenty-eight constellations within and beyond, the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the assisting deities of the eight mountains, the spirits of the four seas, the four rivers, the eight marshes, the nine springs, and the grotto-palaces of the famous mountains, the hidden officials of the water deities, and all the myriad spirits within the cosmos:

We humbly present these words to the Upper Palace, submitting our petition. We, so-and-so, by virtue of our humble and base nature, dwell in the ranks of the common, yet by the grace of our ancestors’ blessings, we have encountered the true teachings of the precious scriptures and authentic methods. We have diligently followed their guidance, heeding their instructions in movement and stillness, and entering into goodness in our daily lives. This is not merely a blessing for ourselves alone but also a benefit extending to seven generations. Yet we, bound by mediocrity and entangled in worldly pursuits, have overstepped our limits and invited fault and regret. Moreover, the karmic retributions of our ancestors remain unresolved, and litigation persists. The three disasters still drive us, and a hundred harms arise in competition. Our qi and life are frail and perilous, compounded by frequent illnesses and misfortunes. Day and night, we are filled with dread, our livers and hearts trembling in distress.

We have observed that within the precious registers of the Jade Emperor’s fasts, there are chapters for prayer and gratitude, and within the inner methods of the Immortal Capital, there are rites for offering and invocation. Though these methods are lofty and wondrous, they are not restricted by rank or status. They can rescue and dispel calamities, prolonging and bestowing blessings. We, leading Daoist disciples numbering so many, have bathed in the waters of the dark clouds, purifying our body-spirits; we have abstained from the flavors of meat and grains, cleansing our viscera. We have hung the celestial silks of the azure groves, unfurling the cloud-script banners of the imperial texts. The incense pearls of the Upper Prime ascend far into the nine heavens, while the true persons burn the dark liquid’s smoke, illuminating the jade court of the dark and yellow. We have arrayed the four nines of lamps, mirroring the thirty-six heavens. With sweet wine and meager offerings, we invite the descent of the divine and mysterious. For three days and three nights, we have performed the Dao, repenting and entreating.

Now, at this time, we humbly beseech the August Lords and Heavenly Thearchs, the Most Sagely Fire Spirit, the celestial true spirits, and the supervising immortal officials to deign to issue commands to all subordinate offices and governing authorities, that they may heed our petition. We pray for the deliverance of the seven generations of our ancestors—our fathers and mothers—and the remaining departed souls of our kin, releasing them from the bonds of suffering and confinement, absolving their penal labors, and ending their banishment and toil. May they each return to dwell in the halls of fortune, enjoying leisure and joy, bestowing protection and benefit upon their descendants, ceasing litigation, and when their allotted years are complete, may they be reborn into wealthy and noble families among humankind, forever preserving peace and prosperity.

We beseech the heavenly officials, soldiers, and local deities of the communities and hamlets, along with the spirits of the current day and talisman, to surround and guard our dwellings, halls, and chambers. May they each expel and eradicate malevolent spirits, dispel ghostly afflictions, cleanse and wash away demonic influences, and proclaim the true qi. If the lingering qi of our deceased ancestors or the burial sites violate taboos, or if the dead and mourning qi are registered, or if within our halls, lodgings, or dwellings lie buried dry bones, the ghosts of deceased servants, or those who died from injury, misfortune, or wandering calamities, or if curses and oaths have drawn them, or if the innocent have met their end—all such deep-seated afflictions that give rise to misfortune—we pray for their resolution and release from litigation, separating the living and the dead into distinct realms.

From this year, month, day, and hour onward, for all three punishments, six harms, clashes and breaks, oppressive killings, the entanglements of the celestial years and Jupiter’s net, as well as blades and warfare, water and fire, illnesses and epidemics, poisonous creatures, bandits and villains, official summons and slander—all inauspicious deaths—we pray that from month to month, day to day, and hour to hour, they may be transmitted and resolved according to the matter at hand, ensuring that they pass without causing harm. May we and our kin forever enjoy reverence in public and private, forming bonds near and far, our Daoist practices flourishing and exalted, our true hearts achieving completion as the seed people, eternally receiving boundless grace and enjoying blessings to the utmost.

We, your subjects so-and-so, with utmost reverence and fear, prostrate ourselves, bowing our heads repeatedly to make this known.

Having prostrated thirty times with my forehead to the ground, I rise and bow again, then recite:

With focused heart I establish the fast,
burn incense and bow to the imperial script,
bathe in the dark clouds’ water,
and send up smoke to reach the Supreme Origin.
The fast is arrayed in four nines,
the Eight Emperors command the divine chapters.
I knock my heart and utter vows,
ascending to be heard in the Three Heavens.
The debts of seven generations are dissolved,
and the burdens of the deceased are entirely absolved.
Passing through the Five Paths,
erasing sins to become an immortal of the highest rank.
One day’s practice of this method
becomes the cause for ten thousand kalpas.
When the true Dao is accomplished,
then shall I behold the Three Sovereign Lords.

Again, I address the censer, saying:
May the jade maidens attending the fragrant smoke and the assembled officials
cause the hidden zhi-plants and jade essences upon this sacred altar
to appear before this incense flame,
that we may attain immortality, our bodies adorned with purple networks and feathered patterns.
May our household enjoy blessings,
and the world rejoice as one.
May the jade maidens attending the altar transmit our words
and report them fully before the Three Sovereign Divine Lords.

Facing north and entering the altar, I knock my teeth twelve times and pray:
May the jade maidens of the fragrant smoke
present this petition before the Three Sovereign True Lords,
the thirty-six celestial immortals and divine officials.
I, your humble servant, the male adept so-and-so,
on behalf of such-and-such prefecture and county,
for such-and-such matter,
have established the Cavern-Divine Three Sovereigns’ Fast.
I request and give thanks.

When the rites are complete, I ascend the altar and enter the chamber to burn incense,
declaring that the merit of this day shall ascend directly,
proceeding to the Purple Palace,
and be respectfully presented before the Three Sovereign True Lords.
After offering incense again, I bow twice more and say:
I have purified myself in fast and cut off worldly dust,
burning incense to offer reverence and thanks.
On behalf of my seven ancestors and parents,
and for my entire household,
I beseech that accumulated transgressions and bound sins be pardoned,
that the trials of the deceased be resolved,
that our names be inscribed on the cinnabar tablets,
and our characters fixed in the azure registers.
May I, so-and-so,
together with the gods of the Three Palaces,
ascend to the Mystic Dawn,
and present myself at the court of the Supreme Clarity,
to behold the Sacred Lord,
receive the scriptures and assume office,
and forever become a perfected immortal.

Facing the Heavenly Sovereign, I bow twice;
then facing the Earthly Sovereign,
and then the Human Sovereign,
I bow twice each, saying:
I, so-and-so, have purified myself in fast and cut off worldly dust,
establishing the Cavern-Divine Three Sovereigns’ Fast on behalf of such-and-such.
I request and give thanks.
When the rites are complete, may the sincerity of this incense offering and reverence
absolve the thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults
accumulated from my ancestors down to my present self,
causing them all to dissolve.
May my illnesses be cured,
my calamities averted,
and may I attain long life and transcend the world,
becoming one of the seed people.

Next, facing the four directions:
To the east, the Nine Celestial Emperor Lords and divine officials of the host of immortals,
I visualize in my heart and bow nine times, then twice more.
To the south, the Nine Celestial Emperor Lords and divine officials of the host of immortals,
I visualize in my heart and bow nine times, then twice more.
To the west, the Nine Celestial Emperor Lords and divine officials of the host of immortals,
I visualize in my heart and bow nine times, then twice more.
To the north, the Nine Celestial Emperor Lords and divine officials of the host of immortals,
I visualize in my heart and bow nine times, then twice more.

I have now purified myself in fast and cut off worldly dust,
establishing the Cavern-Divine Three Sovereigns’ Fast on behalf of such-and-such.
I request and give thanks.
When the rites are complete, may the sincerity of this incense offering and reverence
absolve the thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults
accumulated from my ancestors down to my present self,
causing them all to dissolve.
May my illnesses be cured,
my calamities averted,
and may I attain long life and enduring vision,
forever preserved from misfortune.

Again, facing north, I bow nine times, then twice more, saying:
I, your humble disciple, a minor adept of the *Inner Radiance of the Cavern-Divine Three Sovereigns*,
respectfully address the Most High Dao Lord,
the Most High Lord Lao,
the Most High Elder,
the Three Sovereign Jade Lords,
the Nine Elder Lords of the Immortal Capital,
the Nine Venerable Ones,
the Immortal Officials of the Dark Capital,
the True Gods of the Great Mystery,
the divine officials of the thirty-six heavens above and below,
the Celestial Emperors of the Five Directions,
the various gods of the Great Clarity,
the stellar officials of the twenty-eight lunar lodges within and beyond,
the True Lords of the Five Marchmounts,
the assisting deities of the eight mountains,
the gods of the four seas, four rivers, eight marshes, and nine springs,
the water spirits of the hidden palaces in the named mountains and cavernous grottoes,
and all the myriad spirits throughout the cosmos:
I, together with my fellow Daoist disciples numbering a thousand,
have bathed in the water of the dark clouds,
arrayed the lamps of four nines,
and modeled the rites upon the thirty-six heavens.
On this day of such-and-such month,
we have gathered to commence the fast,
and on such-and-such an auspicious day,
we shall perform the Dao for three days and three nights, twelve hours in all.

When the rites are complete,
may the words we have spoken and the petitions we have presented
be heard and responded to,
and may all our prayers and requests be met with compassionate grace.
The Three Sovereigns’ petition has received the Most High’s decree,
granting our requests as they come.
May the suffering souls of my seven generations of ancestors
be immediately delivered and ascend,
and from this day forth,
may my household flourish in prosperity,
forever secure and blessed,
with both public and private affairs harmonious.
May the merit of the fast be accomplished,
and may the various divine officials and attendants,
the jade maidens of the fragrant smoke,
the overseers of the fast,
the local deities of the land, cities, communities, and villages,
and those who assist and proclaim the rites
all be diligent in their duties.
I respectfully report their merit for promotion and reward,
repaying their labor and virtue.
May the ranks and grades we receive
conform to the statutes of the Dark Capital.

When the rites are concluded,
may each return to their proper office and attend to their duties as before.
Now, I dismantle the altar and remove the mats,
restoring all things to their original state.

I, so-and-so, have personally presented this petition,
extolling the divine canon.
Yet the nether paths are distant and profound,
the principles truly subtle and remote,
the methods wondrous and difficult to fathom,
and many errors and omissions may have occurred.
Moreover, my reverence may have been insufficient,
my heart and form negligent,
the fragrant smoke uneven,
the wine and fruit offerings meager.
The roots of these transgressions may incur hidden reprimands,
and in my private heart, I am filled with dread at the prospect of punishment.
I humbly beseech the Emperor and host of perfected beings
to grant compassionate understanding,
indulgently applying the Three Pardons,
and to absolve me of guilt and punishment.

Again, I knock my head to the ground and bow twice, then address the censer, saying:
May the jade maidens attending the fragrant smoke and the assembled officials
cause the hidden zhi-plants and jade essences upon this sacred altar
to appear before this incense flame,
that we may attain immortality, our bodies adorned with purple networks and feathered patterns.
May our household enjoy blessings,
and the world rejoice as one.
May the jade maidens attending the altar,
upon the completion of our fast,
report our merit before the Three Sovereign Divine Lords.

From *The Established Rites of the Three Sovereigns’ Fast*,
*Highest Mystery*, Scroll Forty-Nine. End.

**Scroll Fifty of the *Highest Mystery*: The Chapter on the Cinder-and-Charcoal Fast**

Before dawn, first perform the customary morning audience rites, then proclaim your office and title. Addressing the censer, say:

We reverently invoke the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Most High Elder; the Supreme and Mysterious Ancient of the Ten Directions; the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies; the Perfected and Great Sages who have attained the Dao; the Lords and Elders; the Heavenly Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the High Ministers and Prime Ministers; the Four Directors and Five Emperors; and all the divine officials and spirits of the Three Realms.

We, mere insects and foul filth, most base and lowly, by some past blessing have been born into this great transformation. The Three Caverns govern the turning of the ages, and the true scriptures have descended into the world. The Three Masters have opened the path to salvation, bestowing upon us wondrous methods—golden writings and jade characters, the secret formulas of immortals.

On the day we received this Dharma, we vowed to exhaust our foolish sincerity, offering our very sinews and bones, to uphold the scriptures’ intent, proclaim the compassionate grace, assist our masters and elders, and widely aid both the hidden and the manifest, delivering all beings and saving heaven and humanity. Whatever petitions are brought before us, we dare not ignore or obstruct.

Now, with reverence, we present our petition, stating: The words of so-and-so are earnest and moving, truly deserving of pity. Following the instructions of the Heavenly Master, we join together to perform the Rite of Cinder and Charcoal. We expose our bodies in the central altar, bind our limbs, let our hair hang loose to cover our foreheads, and suspend our heads by the hair beneath the railing. In accordance with the *Numinous Treasure Fast of Great Atonement for the Lower Prime*, we burn incense and knock our heads to the ground, beseeching grace.

We pray that on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, at the numinous altar in such-and-such a prefecture, county, village, and hall—or in such-and-such a household—we may perform the fast of purification and atonement. We will kindle lamps to continue the light, illuminating all heavens. For three days and three nights, in each of the six periods, we will circumambulate the Dao, repenting and atoning for the sins of our household’s countless ancestors—from the billions of generations past to our parents, uncles, brothers, and all the departed, down to our own selves—across innumerable kalpas and boundless lineages.

In accordance with the fast’s regulations, we have bathed and purified ourselves in this household. We now humbly report this, reflecting that the Three Supreme Worthies, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, and the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center will deign to witness our words. We pray that the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the mighty spirits attending the scriptures, the divine officials of the Three Realms, and the local earth gods will unite in purpose and strength to protect us and this household, young and old alike.

May they sweep clean the fast’s site, the hall, and the dwelling inside and out; exterminate demonic thieves; subdue the Four Māras; and grant us peace of mind and stability of spirit. May our thoughts be clear, heaven serene, earth bright, and our prayers ascend unimpeded. May the fast’s merit be perfected without obstruction.

Though we presumptuously partake of the Great Dharma and wear the tokens of the Perfected, we dwell amid the Five Defilements of this dusty world. Our Three Barriers remain unregulated, our Six Passions unrestrained. We rely on the precepts to restrain and govern ourselves. Following the fast’s regulations, we now recite the precepts’ solemn protocols, that all officials and participants may submit to the Dharma’s discipline. At dawn tomorrow, we will proceed with the rites as prescribed and make further reports.

Next, the *Three Hymns of Wisdom*:

**First Hymn:**
Wisdom arises from non-being,
radiant, transcending the Ten Directions.
It structures emptiness, towering in the mysterious firmament,
naturally drawing in fragrant currents.
Its wonders are beyond thought,
through emptiness, true and real interpenetrate.
Being is ultimately non-being,
non-being is not non-being.

**Second Hymn:**
Wisdom but observes the body—
this is the first step in learning the Dao.
Subtly entering the mysterious workshop,
it naturally records my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever protects,
the demon kings pledge their guardianship.
Resplendent is the vajra body,
transcending the Most High Immortals.

**Third Hymn:**
Wisdom sprouts from the root of precepts,
in the true Dao, precepts are the master.
From this arise the Three Treasures,
revered and received by lofty sages.
Riding this deathless boat,
swiftly we cross the great expanse.
At this moment of reciting precepts,
all heavens come to bow.

From the *Jade Purity Precepts*.

Next, the Dharma Master turns to face east, toward the west, and recites the precepts. All bow to receive them.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: Today, we shall universally proclaim the Dharma’s sound to awaken all beings. For all men and women, we dissolve disasters, avert misfortunes, pray for blessings, deliver lives, and uproot the roots of suffering. May the living behold the Dao, escape the Eight Difficulties, and shed their bodies; may the dead rejoice, feast, ascend to heaven, and swiftly be reborn among humans as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings.

Those who perform fasts and seek the Dao must concentrate their minds. Receive the Ten Precepts with sincerity, remember them without fail, focus your thoughts in silent contemplation, and penetrate the natural. Do not let scattered thoughts disturb your form and spirit. Those who can do this should now listen attentively:

**First Precept:** Let the heart not harbor malice or jealousy. Do not breed hidden harm. Guard your speech and be cautious of transgressions. Let your thoughts dwell in the Dharma.

**Second Precept:** Uphold benevolence and do not kill. Pity and aid all beings. With boundless compassion, save and moisten all.

**Third Precept:** Uphold chastity and yield to righteousness. Do not lust or steal. Constantly practice good thoughts, sacrificing yourself to aid others.

**Fourth Precept:** Be free from lust and desire. Let the heart not wander. Uphold purity and caution, acting without stain.

**Fifth Precept:** Let the mouth be free of evil speech. Words should not be ornate or deceitful. Be upright within and without, avoiding transgressions of speech.

**Sixth Precept:** Reduce alcohol and moderate conduct. Harmonize qi and nature. Do not harm the spirit or commit manifold evils.

**Seventh Precept:** Do not envy those superior to yourself or contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and withdraw, putting others first.

**Eighth Precept:** Do not criticize the scriptures and teachings or slander sacred texts. Personally uphold the Dharma, ever as if facing the gods.

**Ninth Precept:** Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor criticize the Four Assemblies. Heaven and humanity will resent you, harming your spirit and qi.

**Tenth Precept:** In all actions and deeds, be equal and single-minded. Let harmony prevail among people, and peace among spirits. Always act thus.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who cultivate and uphold pure precepts accord with the heart of heaven. Constantly practice great compassion, vowing to deliver all beings. Universally save those in distress, reverently following the teachings without ceasing. Better to die guarding goodness than to live doing evil.

Thus, without regression, you may be delivered from the Five Paths, avoid the Three Evils, be protected by all heavens, and revered by the myriad spirits. By maintaining long fasts and upholding precepts, you will naturally attain deliverance from the world.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dao is revered and its dharma wondrous; the human body is likewise precious. Thus, the Dao unfolds its dharma, bequeathing precepts and scriptures to deliver the human form. Once the human body is delivered, it ascends to become one with the Dao. One should cultivate refined conduct, uphold fasts and precepts, pacify the heart and still the mind, keep aspirations and thoughts clear, direct the will single-mindedly, and maintain unwavering focus. Purify the six viscera, refrain from indulgence beyond moderation, and keep inner and outer realms pure and empty, ever in accord with the natural. On fasting days, when incense is lit and vows are made, the invocation rises upward, piercing the heavens. The patrolling deities of the Four Heavens and the mighty spirits of the Ten Divisions descend to tread the Dao-path, observing and listening to the dharma-sounds, mirroring the radiance of your heart. Those who uphold precepts and practice the Dao have their merits recorded in the heavens; fortune and misfortune manifest instantly. The Dao does not fail those who strive—diligently receive its truth and do not heed demonic words.

The Heavenly Worthy said: When establishing fasts and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings all ride cloud-borne chariots drawn by eight jade carriages of luminous scenes. Realized beings and jade maidens attend them, bearing floral banners. Phoenix songs lead the way, celestial melodies follow, while white cranes and lions roar in harmonious chorus. Incense burns and flowers scatter as they float through the void, coming to witness the Dao-practice and listen to the dharma-sounds. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage. How could one not fully embrace this dharma?

First, one must receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Proceed with measured steps, a composed heart, and a serene mind. Whether sitting, rising, lying, or resting, never depart from proper decorum. The Heavenly Kings rejoice, and your name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity. This is truly attaining the Dao within the space of a single thought.

*(From the* Great Precepts Scripture*. Next: the incense-burner method.)*

The Incense Officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all the attendant incense spirits shall cause the chamber to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms. The host of perfected beings and the hundred spirits will gather before this incense flame. May we, in receiving blessings for the world below, be graced with the favor of the ten directions. May the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens attend the incense smoke, transmitting our words directly to the presence of the Supreme Peerless Dao of the Most High.

*(From the* Scripture of Illuminating the Perfected*. Next: the offering of precepts and hymns.)*

The Dao is the heartless source,
The field where all blessings are sown.
Merit has no fixed master—
Each person’s vow is their own.
Empty the self to respond to all beings,
Focus the mind without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,
Like rain descending from heaven.
High peaks are all encompassed,
Yet the lowly become profound.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
For it contains the dragon’s scales.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom is preserved—
How could it be limited to one’s years?
Uphold the precepts without the slightest lapse,
And in life after life, good affinities will form.
With concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the true Dao.

*(From the* Scripture of the Divine Duke’s Inquiry*.)*

At dawn, proceed together into the altar, reverently paying homage to the master and contemplating the spirits as prescribed.

**Next: The Guarding Spirit Incantations**

**East:**
Nine qi of the Eastern Heavens, the Radiant Star of the Azure Sky, shining brightly, illuminating the nine gates of the eastern quarter, turning the candle of yang light to sweep away filth and dispel miasma. The Luminous Youth attends my chariot, binding demons and restraining spirits, reporting directly to the Celestial Lord. Upholding the true Dao, the vermilion script and jade texts, the talismanic commands of the Nine Heavens swiftly transmit the dragon’s dispatch. May all under heaven be pacified, and may I ascend as a flying immortal.

**South:**
Cinnabar Heaven of the South, where three qi flow with light, the blazing star turns its candle to illuminate the Great Yang. Above dwells the Vermilion Essence, the Luminous Divine Youth, commanding the fire soldiers to guard the three palaces. Severing evil and binding spirits, cutting down demon kings, as decreed by the Northern Emperor, with wind and fire surging through the eight directions. The ringing bells interweave, and none dare disobey. As the true Dao flows, I receive supreme merit, preserving heaven’s eternal existence for countless kalpas without end.

**West:**
The Heaven of Seven Qi in the West, where the Great White Star emits its essence, its light illuminating the Golden Gate, brightening the Great Darkness. Within resides the White Sovereign, known as the Divine Lord, guarding and pacifying to protect my form. Severing the roots of evil, the kingly Dao shines clearly. Palaces and dwellings are ordered, the three luminaries aligned. In harmony with nature, I ascend to the Purple Court. The talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure universally benefit all beings, extending merit to all, bringing peace to heaven and earth.

**North:**
The Mysterious Heaven of the North, where five qi linger, the Star of Dawn shines brilliantly, illuminating the Supreme Subtlety. The Black Numinous Lord, clad in flying dark feathers, guards the five gates, inspecting essences and capturing wrongs. Should any dare to test, they shall be shattered and destroyed. As the jade talisman proclaims, the eight mights of the divine spirits seal the gates of evil and open the radiance of the true Dao, illuminating my body so that the three lights shine together. I ride the void and soar, my form ascending as a flying immortal.

**Center:**
The Yellow Center governs qi and unifies the mysterious and true. The Star of Stability emits its radiance, flowing brilliantly through the Nine Heavens. Twelve Luminous Youths of primordial qi and yang essence blaze with crimson smoke, illuminating the entire dwelling and my body, crushing a hundred evils and slaying ten thousand ghosts. The Central Mountain incantation universally applies, the five spirits pacify and guard, and my body ascends as an immortal.

**Next:** Strike the celestial drum twenty-four times.

**Next: The Incense-Burning Rite**

The Supreme Three Heavens, the True Primordial Three Qi, the Most High Lord Lao, summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officials within our bodies, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Courier Officers, the Incense-Attending Golden Lads, the Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers, the Thirty-Six Direct Talisman Officials of the Five Thearchs, and the Thirty-Six Daily Incense Officials. Let them emerge, arrayed in solemn attire, opening the gates. The local earth deities and territorial spirits of this place, we now burn incense and practice the Dao, praying that the true qi of the Ten Directions from the Most High may descend and flow into our bodies, so that our entreaties swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Peerless Great Dao, the Most Perfect Jade Emperor of the Most High.

**After the incense offering is completed**, all officials kneel in reverence. Strike the celestial drum twenty-four times, then the officials present their reports.

We respectfully summon the Five Body True Officials and Merit Officers within our bodies, the Twelve Officers of the Upper Three Heavens who enforce the law and transform yin and yang, the Lords and Officers who deliver the Dao and dispel disasters, disperse misfortunes, and resolve calamities, and the Twelve Officers who govern our duties. The Great Generals of the Central Establishment who monitor merit in our domain, the vanguard who effect merit, the rearguard who execute punishments, the Post Station Commanders and Deputies, the Four Division Inspectors of Merit, the Petitioners, the Immortal Envoys within our bodies, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, the Healing Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Decision Officers, the Chariot and Vermilion Talisman Officers, the Gale Courier Officers, the Post Horse Memorial Officers, the Flying Dragon Courier Officers—let two of each emerge.

Let them emerge in solemn attire, adorned with caps and sashes, their regalia impeccable. The Direct Merit Officers wear the Heaven-Piercing Crown and black single-layered robes. The Orthodox Unity Merit Officers wear the Vermilion Yang Cap and crimson robes. The Memorial Officers wear the Nine Virtues Crown, five-colored longevity robes, tiger talisman belts, and hold jade tablets. The Direct Merit Officers stand at the four directions, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers stand at the center, and the Healing Merit Officers guard our bodies. The Left Attendant Envoys hold the standard in front, the Right Attendant Envoys hold the banners behind. The Yang Spirit Decision Officers stand to the left, the Yin Spirit Decision Officers to the right. The Upper Division Merit Officers stand above, the Middle Division Merit Officers stand within our bodies, and the Qi-Urging Merit Officers hasten the qi of the ten directions. The Upper Division Envoys gaze toward the heavens, the Middle Division Envoys survey the eight directions, and the General Envoys encircle our bodies with rain. The Tiger-Rushing Officials inspect for deceit, the Hook-Riding Generals and Palace Attendants, the Celestial Soldiers gather qi, the Qi-Consuming Officers gather spirits, the Spirit-Consuming Officers gather ghosts, the Ghost-Consuming Officers gather evil, the Evil-Consuming Officers gather essences, the Essence-Consuming Officers gather toxins, the Toxin-Consuming Officers execute talismans, the Temple-Destroying Officers and Chariot Officers, the Vermilion Talisman Officers and Gale Couriers, the Post Horse Memorial Officers and Flying Dragon Couriers—let them assemble before, behind, to the left, and right of us. The Merit Officers array themselves in solemn formation, and when the matter is concluded, the ceremonial guards open the gates.

The Numinous Treasure Officials, the Supervising Fasting Lords, the Twenty-Four Governances established by the Heavenly Master, the Thirty-Six Quiet Retreats, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Sacred Mountains, the Upper Palaces of Kunlun and the thirty-six thousand gods, the sun, moon, and stars, the Jade Armillary Sphere, the Five Thearchs of Heaven and Earth, the officials and generals of the Three Realms, the Two Mysteries, the Three Origins, the Four Beginnings, the Four Directions, the winds and qi, the Officers of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, the Summoning Lords, the Nine Yi Hu Lords of the East, the Eight Man Yue Lords of the South, the Six Rong Shi Lords of the West, the Five Di Qiang Lords of the North, the Three Qin Cang Lords of the Center, the Lords of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the marsh and pond spirits, the local deities of mountains, rivers, streams, valleys, forests, and groves, the Root-Source Land Deities of the Two Streams, the Earth and Grain Generals—let all array themselves in solemn attire.

At this moment, the Merit Officers and Flying Dragon Couriers within our bodies, together with the aforementioned, ascend to report to the Supreme Peerless Great Dao, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Most High Venerable One, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Peerless Great Dao, the Host of Perfected and Celestial Worthies, the Most Perfect Great Emperor, the Celestial Emperor and Heavenly Master Lords, the Numinous Treasure Supervising Fasting Great Dharma Masters, and all the officials and lords. Born and raised in the mortal world, we have sunk into the degenerate age, indulging in fleeting pleasures and transient glory, blessed with a thousand-year gathering. By misfortune, we have been selected to receive the great transformation, the Three Treasures and divine scriptures bestowed by the Three Masters through covenant. We offer reverent worship, seeking our desires, bearing the weight of profound grace, our hearts filled with both joy and trepidation.

On the day we received the Dharma, we must exhaust our foolish limitations, offering even the hairs of our bodies, to uphold and cultivate the scriptural teachings, proclaiming the numinous sounds to nurture compassion for all beings and deliver both heaven-dwellers and humans. Herewith, a certain man or woman, official or commoner, named so-and-so, from such-and-such prefecture, county, township, and village, has submitted a petition, presenting their case before us with a sincere and trembling heart, beseeching redress and review. We hereby submit this petition on their behalf, humbly reciting the words of their plea.

*Recitation of the petition.*

As we have examined the words of this petition, the matters described are urgent and truly pitiable. Unable to bear what we have witnessed, we respectfully join together, following the instructions of the Heavenly Master, to advocate for those mired in suffering. We expose ourselves upon the altar, binding our bodies and tying our limbs, scattering our hair to cover our foreheads, suspending our heads by our hair beneath the altar railings. In accordance with the *Great Rite of Atonement* of the *Lower Prime* of the *Numinous Treasure*, we establish rectitude, burning incense and lighting lamps to illuminate the myriad heavens. For three days and three nights, in each of the six periods, we perform the ritual circumambulation, repenting and atoning for the transgressions and offenses of so-and-so’s ancestors—countless generations of fathers and mothers, uncles and brothers, the departed and the long-dead, spanning innumerable kalpas and lineages—along with the sins and faults of so-and-so’s own person, whether living or deceased. We lay bare our innermost hearts, prostrating ourselves in utmost sincerity, and vow to invoke the celestial immortal armies of nine hundred million riders, the terrestrial immortal armies of nine hundred million riders, the flying immortal armies of nine hundred million riders, the divine immortal armies of nine hundred million riders, the stellar constellation armies of nine hundred million riders, the Nine Palaces’ armies of nine hundred million riders, the Five Marchmounts’ armies of nine hundred million riders each, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ armies of nine hundred million riders each, the thirty-two *Celestial Overseers of the Fast*, the thirty-two *Golden Lads of Incense*, the thirty-two *Jade Maidens of Flower Scattering*, the thirty-two *Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors* each, and the *Flying Dragon Couriers of Memorials*. May they all descend together to oversee the ritual hall. As we hold the incense and make our vows, may our words ascend without obstruction. When the circumambulation is complete, may the diligent *Immortals of Merit* and the *Officials of Merit*, along with their subordinates, the *Merit Couriers* and *Flying Dragon Couriers*, distinguish and transmit our memorials, reporting them in due time. Once the matters are presented, may they return to our bodies and resume their places within our palaces. When summoned again, may they arrive as before, in accordance with established protocol.

*Three rolls of the drum.*

**First Offering of Incense:**
We, the *Festive Masters of the Heavenly Master’s* such-and-such *Orthodox Lineage*, the *Most Supreme Numinous Treasure Three Caverns Dharma Masters*, and the *Perfected of* such-and-such *Marchmount*, humbly address the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Non-Being*, the *Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Jade Emperor*, the *Perfected and Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao*, the *Lords and Venerable Ones*, the *Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors*, the *Jade Void Supreme Emperor*, the *Jade Emperor and Great Emperor*, *Donghua*, *Nanji*, *Xiling*, *Beizhen*, the *Jade Capital of Xuandu*, the *Golden Watchtower*, the *Seven-Treasured Mystic Terrace*, the *Purple Tenuity Upper Palace*, the *Perfected of the Numinous Treasure*, the *Radiant August Dao Lord*, the *Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center*, and the *Heavenly Master Lords*. By karmic affinity from past lives, we were born into this age of the Dao’s teaching. Through the misguided favor of our masters and perfected ones, we were uplifted, our decayed bodies opened to the Dao, and we were instructed in the scriptures and Dharma. The boundless grace of this surpassing kindness leaves us indebted beyond measure. On the day we received the Dharma, we swore an oath with the Three Officials to devote our very lives and bones, to propagate the great transformation, to confront the unseen realms, to assist our masters and elders, and to deliver all beings.

*Recitation of the petition follows.*

We humbly join together, following the Heavenly Master’s instructions, to advocate for those mired in suffering. We bind our bodies, tie our limbs, and press our foreheads to the earth, prostrating with all five limbs beneath the altar railings. In accordance with the *Great Rite of Atonement* of the *Lower Prime* of the *Numinous Treasure*, we burn incense and perform the fast, circumambulating in the six periods of day and night. On behalf of so-and-so, we repent for the transgressions of their ancestors—countless generations of fathers and mothers, uncles and brothers, spanning innumerable kalpas and lineages—along with the faults of so-and-so’s household, great and small, from past lives to the present, including all offenses unforgiven by Heaven, unabsolved by Earth, unpardoned by humans, and unreleased by ghosts: the myriad sins and countless transgressions that violate the *Three Primes’ One Hundred Eighty Precepts*, the *Three Officials’ Nine Bureaus and One Hundred Twenty Offices*, and the judgments of the *Yin-Yang, Water-Fire, Left-Right, and Central Palace Examiners*. Today, we burn incense and dedicate these merits so that so-and-so’s ancestors—forefathers and foremothers, the departed and the long-dead—may be freed from suffering, ascend to the Heavenly Palace, receive blessings in the Southern Palace, and return their bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao.

We prostrate ourselves, returning our lives to the *Three Celestial Worthies of the Most High*, and dedicate these merits to so-and-so’s ancestors—countless generations of fathers and mothers, the departed and the long-dead—praying they may be spared the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, ascend to the Heavenly Palace, be clothed and fed by nature, and dwell forever in non-action.

Today, we burn incense and return ourselves to the virtue of our masters, the *Great Sages and Perfected Ones*, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into non-being and unite with the Dao as true.

**Second Offering of Incense:**
We humbly offer incense once more, dedicating these merits to the emperor and lords of the realm, to their ministers and officials, to the common people, to our Dharma-teaching masters, to our parents and honored kin, to our fellow disciples and students, to the reclusive Daoists dwelling in mountains and forests to cultivate the true Dao, and to all worthy ones. May each attain the Dao, returning their bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao.

We prostrate ourselves, returning our lives to the *Three Celestial Worthies of the Most High*, and dedicate these merits to the emperor and lords of the realm, their ministers and officials, the common people, our Dharma-teaching masters, our parents and honored kin, our fellow Daoist disciples and worthy ones. May they be spared the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, each preserving their blessings and destinies, and ultimately enter non-action.

Today, we burn incense and return ourselves to the virtue of our masters, the *Great Sages and Perfected Ones*, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into formlessness and unite with the Dao as true.

**Third Offering of Incense:**
We humbly offer incense once more, dedicating these merits to so-and-so’s own person, their household and lineage, their ninefold kin and in-laws, the officials and commoners of the realm, all *Festive Masters* and *Libationers*, the people of the world, and all creatures—whether crawling, wriggling, creeping, or gasping—every living being. May they return their bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao.

We prostrate ourselves, bodies pressed to the earth, and surrender our lives to the *Most High Three Venerables*. May these merits flow to the household of so-and-so, dispersing calamities and scattering misfortunes, bringing blessings and joy in life, ensuring peace and prosperity for their dwelling, and flourishing for their gates. May so-and-so attain transcendence and ascension, enter non-action, and unite in virtue with the Four Great Elements. May all in their household, young and old, and all people under heaven—every crawling, wriggling, creeping, and gasping being—be spared the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, the Five Poisons, water and fire, bandits, plagues, demonic harms, and all afflictions. May each preserve their blessings and destinies, dwelling in peace and non-action.

Today, we burn incense and return ourselves to the virtue of our masters, the *Great Sages and Perfected Ones*, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into formlessness and unite with the Dao as true.

**Next: Repentance Text to the Ten Directions**
East, South, West, North, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest, Above, Below.

We, the male official *Libationer* so-and-so of such-and-such parish, humbly present this inked petition, declaring: For years past, our dwelling has been inauspicious, our endeavors thwarted, illnesses unrelenting, and fears of life and death pressing. Misfortunes and transgressions have accumulated, celestial administrations have met with adversity, and our prayers for deliverance have gone unanswered. Thus, we reverently follow the *Lingbao* Rite of *Lower Prime* for repentance amid the ashes, prostrating ourselves in the central altar, bowing our heads in supplication, and beseeching the great mercy of pardon and absolution. We implore forgiveness for ourselves, our ancestors of myriad generations, our parents, uncles, brothers, and all in our household—young and old—for all transgressions committed from past lives to this day: disrespect toward the *Great Sages and Venerable Deities*, the sun, moon, and stars, the four seasons and five phases, our masters and elders, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, all *Perfected Ones*, *Divine Immortals*, *Jade Maidens*, deities of the Three Realms and Earth, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and all divine beings. Our offenses are innumerable and vile, our sins boundless: deceiving our masters and betraying the Dao, defiling the celestial scriptures, greed corrupting our bodies, illicit teachings, failing to pledge to the Five Emperors, plotting rebellion, acting with disloyalty, lacking compassion and filial piety, devoid of love and benevolence, rebelling against rulers and fathers, slaughtering living beings, seizing others’ possessions, adultery, envy of those superior, contending for fame and rank, hypocrisy, slandering the worthy, consuming wine and meat, polluting the five spirits, cursing and reviling, wanton misconduct, violating the Eight Precepts and auspicious days with erratic joy and anger, oppressing orphans and widows, abandoning the elderly, trampling the poor, favoring the powerful—such sins are beyond count.

We beseech that through the burning of incense and repentance, all may be absolved and dispersed, granting us a fresh beginning. May the dark paths of our ancestors’ wandering souls be illuminated, all liberated and transformed into roots of faith, freed from the Five Paths. May the karmic bonds of the deceased be severed, granting them eternal bliss, while the living receive grace. May their karmic debts be dissolved, their punishments erased. We implore the erasure of our names from the Black Registers of the Right Palace and their inscription in the Azure Records of the Left Bureau. May the *qi* of the Dao overshadow us, divine beings protect us, misfortunes turn to blessings, peril to fortune, calamities averted, and harm expelled. May demonic bandits be vanquished, true *qi* descend and flow, warming and nourishing our bones and joints, harmonizing the five viscera, regulating the hundred meridians. May all suffering cease, all treatments take effect, our radiance enhanced, our spirits settled, our lives preserved, and the grace of the Dao eternally borne.

**Next: Repentance Text to the Four Directions**
West, North, East, South.

We, the male official *Libationer* so-and-so of such-and-such household, establish this fast and perform the Dao, praying for blessings and the dissolution of calamities, repenting for the sins of the living and the dead, that all may be harmonized and released. May the *qi* of the Dao overshadow us, the hidden and manifest be delivered, our households find peace, superiors and inferiors enjoy myriad blessings, our gates flourish, and fortune be our constant guest. May we dwell in perpetual auspiciousness, all good affinities converge, and we avoid the Three Evil Realms. May our wishes be fulfilled.

**Next:** Visualize, command the demons, and circumambulate thrice while reciting the scriptures as prescribed.

**Next:** By day, face west; by night, face north. Dishevel your hair and cover your head with mud. All officials resume their positions and declare their titles.

The Lords and Officers, the *Inspectors of the Five Qi*, the *Parents of the Myriad Dao*, the *Parents of the Myriad Qi*, the *Parents of the Myriad Virtues*, the *Parents of Heaven and Earth*, from whom gods and immortals emerge and where immortals and sages gather;
the *Eastern King Father*, the *Western Queen Mother*, the *Lord of the Sun*, the *Lady of the Moon*, and all the great gods among the celestial officials of the immortals—

We, your servants, by karmic affinity from past lives, have encountered the transformation of the Dao. Through the mistaken grace of our masters and perfected ones, we have been uplifted and guided, our decayed remains enlightened, and our understanding deepened by the scriptures and their teachings. The boundless kindness of this surpassing grace is beyond measure. On the day we received the precepts, we swore an oath before the *Three Officials* to exhaust our bodies and lives, offering our sinews and bones in service, to propagate the great transformation and answer in the unseen realms. We assist our masters and elders, delivering and aiding all beings.

With reverence, we now recite these words. According to the petition of [so-and-so], the sincerity of their plea and the urgency of their plight are truly pitiable. As we have presumptuously partaken in the great vehicle and hold the duty of salvation, we cannot bear what we have witnessed. Humbly joining together, we act on the command of the Celestial Master to relieve those mired in suffering. Binding our bones and prostrating ourselves, we press our hair into the mud and our foreheads to the earth, our five centers smeared with dust beneath the altar rails. Following the *Great Thanksgiving Fast of the Lower Prime* from the *Numinous Treasure* scriptures, we burn incense and perform the Dao day and night in the six periods. For [so-and-so], we first repent on behalf of their countless ancestors—fathers, mothers, uncles, brothers—across innumerable kalpas and myriad generations, down to their own person, household, and all within, for the transgressions of past lives and present existence. These are offenses that Heaven does not pardon, Earth does not absolve, humanity does not pity, and ghosts do not release: ten thousand sins and a million transgressions, violations of the *Three Primes’* one hundred eighty statutes, the crimes recorded by the *Three Officials*, *Nine Bureaus*, one hundred twenty courts, and the yin-yang, water-fire, left-right, and central palace examiners.

We beseech the release from tribulation, the passage through calamity, baring our hearts and exposing our livers, daring not to offer falsehood. May the Most High, the august perfected ones, and the exalted gods deign to look upon us with compassion, opening the vast mercy of their grace and returning the boundless kindness of their favor. Deliver and remove the transgressions of [so-and-so]’s ancestors across innumerable kalpas and myriad generations, down to their own person and all present beings—all the countless sins, evils, and offenses they have committed, the punishments and debts they bear. Pity, pardon, and absolve their grievances, reconcile their trials, and restore all that has been recorded. Sever the flow of accumulated misfortune, and may all be extinguished. Grant peace to their tombs, that no disasters arise. May the suffering souls of the long-departed and recently dead receive blessings and joy. May their karmic punishments be dispersed, their banishments erased. We beg that their names be stricken from the black registers of the right palace and inscribed in the green records of the left bureau. May the Dao’s qi cover them, and the divine spirits protect them. Turn misfortune into fortune, reverse calamity into good fortune. Ward off disasters, repel harm, deliver them from tribulation, and eliminate their shortened lifespans. Inscribe their names in the registers of long life. May their households and kin pass through hardships, recover from illness, and all be preserved in myriad blessings. Drive the pestilences, demonic plagues, poisons, and thousand disasters to the eight directions. May their gates and households flourish, drawing all goodness to them. May the living and dead alike enjoy peace and prosperity, and may we look up in gratitude to the grace of the Dao.

The ritual concludes. The Dharma Master offers incense and stands facing east. Next, the *Twelve Aspirations* are recited, and the incense is offered again.

The Incense Official Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attending spirit officials of the incense—may golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms spontaneously arise upon this open-air altar. May the hundred spirits gather here before this fragrant flame. We pray that the Emperor be blessed with myriad fortunes, that the realm receive grace, and that the golden lads and jade maidens of the ten directions attend the incense smoke to transmit our words directly to the throne of the Supreme Non-Ultimate Dao, the Jade Emperor.

When the retreat concludes, the High Merit Dharma Master faces east and strikes the celestial drum twenty-four times, each declaring his name and rank.

The disciple of the Supreme Numinous Treasure, the peerless Cavern Mystery, the Dharma Master of the Numinous Treasure, your servant [Name], bows twice with reverence and respectfully addresses the Supreme Non-Ultimate Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, the Peerless Mysterious Ancient, the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the hosts of sagely Perfected Ones, the Heavenly Emperor, the Celestial Master, the Lord of the Numinous Treasure, and the Great Dharma Master overseeing this retreat. Though born of common ignorance, unworthy and base, we delight in the Dao and rejoice in immortality. Unjustly entrusted with the Dharma office, we ascend through the nine mysteries of the luminous realm, dedicating our meager efforts as if offering even our hair and down. We now humbly present our fellow Dharma practitioners, male and female officials [Names], who submit their words in sincerity, pledging their lives and making this petition.

We beseech your salvation and governance. Together, we have ascended at the hour of *yin* on this day of the present month to this [Prefecture, County, Village], where, by the decree and teaching of the Celestial Master, we establish this retreat of repentance and renewal. Exposed upon the central altar, we perform the Great Retreat of Repentance for the Lower Prime, burning incense, reciting scriptures, contemplating the spirits, and invoking the Perfected Ones. For three days and nights, in six periods each day, we perform the ritual circumambulation. The rites conclude at the hour of *chou* on this day of the present month.

We hereby invoke and beseech the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Perfected Ones, Divine Beings, the constellations of the sun, moon, and stars, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the divine armies of immortals—nine hundred million cavalry in all. We summon the overseers of the retreat, the attendants of scriptures and incense, the golden lads and jade maidens, the Perfected Ones supervising the retreat, the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the messengers who transmit and memorialize, the flying dragon riders, and the Perfected Immortals of the four directions who inspect and verify. May the Perfected Officials return, the advanced immortals be promoted, ranks and imperial titles be conferred, and appointments to Perfected offices be made according to the rites of the Great Perfected.

May we who perform the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May we transform and divide our forms, descending in the seventy-four directions during the Three Primes, all arriving in green chariots to soar through the Highest Clarity, ascending the nine heavens of the luminous realm, where sun and moon shine together and the Three Treasures turn as one. We humbly beseech the Perfected Ones to witness our sincere devotion.

Yet our study of the Dharma remains incomplete, and the standards of our retreat and rituals fall short of perfection. Our conduct may violate the codes, transgressing the statutes scrutinized by the Four Offices and enforced by the Five Emperors. For our thousand transgressions and myriad faults, we beg your compassionate pardon, that we may return to our original state, unaware of punishment or blame.

May the Perfected Officials within our five bodies ascend according to merit to the Mysterious Capital to receive their ranks. When their tasks are complete, may they return to our bodies and ascend with us, soaring through the great void.

We respectfully submit this petition and await your response. Your servants [Names], trembling with awe, bow their heads to the ground, prostrate themselves, and reverently make this known.

The Fifty-First Scroll of the *Supreme Secret Essentials* Concludes
**Scroll Fifty-One: The Rite of the Covenant with the Perfected**

Before the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the ritual master advances to make obeisance and addresses the Heavenly Worthy, saying: Today, as we attend in your august presence, we have witnessed the divine youths of the various heavens receiving their majestic radiance, their luminous brilliance universally illuminating the celestial halls of blessings and the boundless worlds within the hells. The retribution of good and evil differs in suffering and joy. Those who are good rejoice in boundless ease; those who are evil wallow in filth, drifting through the Eight Difficulties, their bodily forms lost forever—how grievous and lamentable! For all such beings who endure the causes of evil, facing eons of unending opposition, unaware of the root of their fate, we know not whether there exists any merit to redeem and deliver the souls of the dead from the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms, guiding them into the light, reborn through the gate of blessings. If we might receive your compassionate mercy, both the living and the dead would bear this grace: the departed would rejoice, and the living would flourish, prosperous and flourishing, their lifespans long and enduring. Then clouds would shade the eight distant realms, and winds would sprinkle the forests of orchids. In future lives, their sons and daughters would hear the sounds of the Dao, and we only pray that the Heavenly Worthy will distinguish and expound upon these matters, bestowing upon us the decisive words, that all may see and understand.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying: Listen carefully. Reflect deeply upon my words and inscribe them within your heart. Morning and night, hold them in mind, and take care never to forget them. I shall now expound for you the wondrous sounds, which you may follow and employ to redeem the sinful souls, liberating them from the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms and the Eight Difficulties, dissolving their karmic bonds, turning them toward the root of faith, so that both the living and the dead may rejoice, their karmic connections spanning lifetimes. This method is most sublime, transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. Should there be one of wisdom and discernment who vows to receive it, keep it secret, and blessings shall descend; should it be divulged, blessings shall cease. The warning of the Wind and Blade arises from the Covenant with the Perfected—those who violate its precepts and transgress its statutes shall have no cause to resent the heavens.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Flying Celestial Beings to expound upon the karmic consequences of sin and merit, delivering the highest-grade souls. As the scripture was recited, the sun, moon, and stars of the various heavens shone brightly, universally illuminating the Nine Earths, the boundless worlds, the abodes of eternal night, and the Nine Dark Realms. The long-suffering hungry ghosts, the toiling dead souls, received the light and universally beheld the root of their fate. Thereupon, they awakened, all turning their hearts at once, each resolving to cultivate goodness, recalling the gate of blessings. The Five Sufferings were dissolved, the Three Wretched Realms received deliverance, karmic bonds were untangled, and the hells grew tranquil and still. At that time, men and women universally heard the sounds of the Dao, and those who had prepared their hearts all attained transcendence.

The Flying Celestial Beings declared: The Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms delivers the dead souls, resolving the highest-grade karmic bonds. This should be performed during the six fasting months of the year—the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months—on the following days: the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth of each month (ten days in total), as well as the Eight Seasonal Festivals, the days of *jiazi* and *gengshen*. Within the central courtyard of the home, set up a tall lamp, nine feet in height, and upon this single lamp, kindle nine flames. Let their light shine upward to illuminate the celestial halls of blessings in the Nine Mysterious Heavens and downward to illuminate the boundless worlds within the eternal night of the Nine Earths. In accordance with the ancient rites of solemn dignity, invoke and invite the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Perfected Ones, Flying Immortals, the sun, moon, and stars, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors, the soldiers and cavalry of the Five Sacred Peaks, the Three Rivers, the Four Seas—each numbering ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine—and thirty-two persons to scatter flowers, thirty-two Jade Maidens, thirty-two Direct Attendants of the Five Emperors, and a full assembly of messengers, heralds, and Flying Dragon Riders to descend, overseeing the ritual hall. Knead the incense, make vows, and recite the prayers aloud, their words ascending to the heavens. When the ritual circumambulation is complete, all shall be reported and sent back to their celestial palaces.

By day, burn incense; by night, kindle the lamps, ensuring the smoke of the incense never ceases. Display the scriptures in the courtyard beneath the nine lamps. Circumambulate the lamps, offer incense, make vows, and when finished, face east and bow nine times, saying:

Today, I, [Name], submit my life to the Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, the Great Sage Host of the Perfected Who Have Attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords, the Nine *Qi* Heavenly Lords, and the various divine officials of the Eastern Realm. Today, I establish this retreat, burn incense, and kindle lamps, dedicating these merits to illuminate the various heavens. May they universally benefit the Emperor, the lords of states, their ministers and officials, the people who receive the Dao, the Dharma Masters, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, recluses in the mountains and forests who study the true Dao, all worthy ones, and all living beings—those that creep, crawl, walk, or breathe—so that all may escape the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, dwell perpetually in non-action, and universally receive the natural blessings. May the imprisoned souls of my family’s myriad ancestors, bound in the darkness, receive the light, all be liberated, turn toward the root of faith, depart the Five Paths, resolve their karmic bonds, and may the dead enjoy eternal joy while the living receive grace. May the world know great peace, and may the Dao and its virtue flourish.

Today, I burn incense and submit myself to the virtue of the Great Sage Host of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, I may ascend into formlessness and unite with the Dao as a Perfected One.

When finished, remove the headscarf, kowtow, and strike the cheeks eighty-one times.

Next, face south and bow three times, saying:

Today, I, [Name], submit my life to the Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the South, the Great Sage Host of the Perfected Who Have Attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords, the Three *Qi* Heavenly Lords, and the various divine officials of the Southern Realm. The vows are made as in the method above.

When finished, remove the headscarf, kowtow, and strike the cheeks twenty-seven times each.

Next, face west and bow seven times, saying:

Today, I, [Name], submit my life to the Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the West, the Great Sage Host of the Perfected Who Have Attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords, the Seven *Qi* Heavenly Lords, and the various divine officials of the Western Realm. The vows are made as in the method above.

When finished, kowtow and strike the cheeks sixty-three times each.

Next, face north and bow five times, saying:

Today, I, [Name], submit my life to the Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the North, the Great Sage Host of the Perfected Who Have Attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords, the Five *Qi* Heavenly Lords, and the various divine officials of the Northern Realm. The vows are made as in the method above.

When finished, kowtow and strike the cheeks forty-five times each.

Next, face northeast and bow once, saying:

Today, I, [Name], submit my life to the Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, the Great Sage Host of the Perfected Who Have Attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords, the *Fan Qi* Heavenly Lord, and the various divine officials of the Northeastern Realm. The vows are made as in the eastern method above.

When finished, kowtow and strike the cheeks nine times each.

Next, face southeast. Then southwest. Then northwest. For all four corners, bow once each, kowtow, and strike the cheeks nine times each, submitting the life as in the northeastern method.

When the four corners are completed, next face the northwest upper direction and bow thirty-two times, saying:

Today, I, [Name], submit my life to the Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Thirty-Two Heavens Above, the Great Sage Host of the Perfected Who Have Attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords, the Heavenly Lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Perfected of the Jade Capital, Mysterious Metropolis, and Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, the Jade Maidens, Divine Immortals, and various divine officials. The vows are made as in the eastern method above.

When finished, kowtow and strike the cheeks two hundred eighty-eight times each.

Next, face the southeast lower direction and bow twelve times, saying:

Today, I, [Name], submit my life to the Boundless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, the Great Sage Host of the Perfected Who Have Attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords, the August Sovereigns of the Nine Lands, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the Twelve Immortal Ministers, the Perfected of the Five Marchmounts, Four Seas, and Nine Palaces, the Divine Immortals and Jade Maidens, and the various divine officials of the Nine Realms of the Boundless World below. Now, I establish this fast, burn incense, and light lamps, wishing that by this merit, the light may illumine the long-night repository of the Boundless World below and the Nine Dark Realms. May it universally benefit the emperors and kings, lords of states, ministers and officials, common people, Dharma-receiving masters, parents and honored kin, fellow students and disciples, reclusive scholars of the Dao in mountains and forests, and all worthy ones, as well as the long-night dead souls of my own ancestors through countless generations. May the transgressions they committed in former lives—violations of heavenly prohibitions and earthly taboos, sins and evils entangled, karmic retributions endured, suffering through cycles of rebirth, bound in the Five Pains, trapped in the long night without escape—be repented and redeemed through this burning of incense and lighting of lamps. May the radiant light universally illumine the long-night repository and the Nine Dark Hells, liberating the imprisoned souls, dissolving their karmic roots, so that the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus no longer detain them. May they be delivered, ascend, and enter the Hall of Blessings, depart from evil paths, and forever dwell in the gates of goodness, the households of marquises and kings, where they may be reborn in joy and the world enjoy peace. Now, I burn this incense and submit myself to the virtue of the Great Sage Host of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, I may ascend into the formless and unite with the Dao in truth.

When finished, kowtow and strike the cheeks one hundred twenty times each.

Volume Fifty-One of the *Supreme Secret Essentials* concludes.
Volume Fifty-Two of the *Supreme Secret Essentials*: The Three Primes Fast, Altar Diagrams

Construct the altar with red clay in three tiers. Atop it, place five blue-green tables, each bearing an incense burner.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: On the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, at the three hours of dawn, noon, and midnight, bathe the body. Wash oneself with the Five Fragrances.

When preparing to bathe, face the southwest and ladle the fragrant water with a golden dipper, circling to the southeast thirty-two times. Close the eyes and visualize the sunlight above the left eye, moonlight above the right, the Five Stars entwining the head, and clouds of five colors raining around the body. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane array to left and right. Immortal youths hold towels; Jade Maidens scatter blossoms. Flying immortals ride mounts as attendants guard the body. Then, click the teeth thirty-two times.

Recite the incantation:
The heavens are limpid, the qi pure,
Five hues resplendent on high.
Sun and moon radiate brilliance,
Bathing my form in light.
Divine fluids inwardly cleanse;
Fragrant waters refine my essence.
Luminous splendor shines through,
Illumining the Supreme Clarity.
Qi remains unstained by dust;
The Five Viscera receive the numinous.
Sins vanish from the Three Paths,
Calamities disperse from the Nine Darks.
Evil roots are severed;
Fortune and blessings arise of themselves.
Today, I make this great vow,
And pledge it before all.
My body receives liberation,
Ascending to the Imperial Court.

Conclude by swallowing saliva upward twenty-two times, then bathe the Five Spirits.

After bathing, don the cap and robes, and click the teeth twelve times.

Recite the incantation:
The Five Turbidities are now clear,
The Eight Effulgences now bright.
Today, I undergo refinement—
Sins perish, fortune is born.
Ever with the Five Thearchs,
I join the perfected and upper spirits.

Then exit and enter the chamber to perform the Dao according to the method. Within the chamber, face east, burn incense, and click the teeth thirty-two times.

Recite the incantation:

Supreme Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, First Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao,

Summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Courier Dragon Riders, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Two Direct Attendants of the Five Thearchs. Let all who emerge be arrayed in solemn attire. Open the gates and notify the local earth deities and true officials of this realm: this servant now burns incense and performs the Dao, presenting petitions for his wishes. May the qi of the ten directions’ true and perfected ones enter this servant’s body, so that his supplications swiftly ascend and are heard before the Limitless Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Great Dao, the Perfect and True Jade Emperor.

This disciple of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, named [so-and-so], styled Master of the Sacred Peak, [so-and-so], by karmic affinity of past lives, was born into the transformation of the Dao. Through the guidance of the Three Caverns’ Dharma Master, [so-and-so], I was uplifted and delivered, my decayed bones refined. Having received the scriptural teachings, the grace bestowed is boundless beyond measure. Yet, raised in the mundane world, my Five Spirits contend in strife; dust-laden sins and defilements have long gone unnoticed, growing with my transgressions. Like mountains and seas, they have amassed from past lives to the present—through how many kalpas, I know not. Even now, my sins bind heaven and earth, recorded in what ledgers, seized by the Three Officials, detained for earthly servitude. Though I have cultivated and disciplined myself, my efforts have not pierced through; true numina do not descend, and demonic hordes assail me. My thoughts scatter, my Five Spirits take flight. I constantly fear that one day I will return to the dark abyss, sinking for ten thousand kalpas, forever beyond deliverance.

On this auspicious day of the Three Origins’ great celebration, with pure fasting and burning incense, I first repent for the transgressions of past lives and those accumulated to this day—offenses unforgiven by heaven, unabsolved by earth, unpitied by spirits, unreleased by ghosts. My countless sins and myriad faults have violated the Three Origins’ one hundred eighty precepts, the Three Officials’ nine bureaus and one hundred twenty courts, the yin-yang, water-fire, left-right, and central palace inquisitors’ judgments. Today, I burn incense, returning body, spirit, and life to the Limitless Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Dao Lord, the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Emperors, the Ten Directions’ Great Sage Assemblies of Perfected Ones, the Lords and Venerable Ones, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Heavenly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Divine Immortals, Earthly Immortals, the True Persons of the Five Peaks, Jade Maidens, the celestial sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Jade Armillary Sphere, and the earth’s ten directions’ limitless spirit officials, the Three Realms’ Five Thearchs, Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Courts, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Nine Rivers and Eight Poles’ host of divine spirits. I beseech all officials to grant great mercy, absolving the sins of my past and present lives. Through the merit of this incense offering, may my sinful roots be uprooted. I pray that my name be erased from the earthly registers, my offenses stricken from the Black Ledgers of the Right Palace, and my record transferred to the Green Ledgers of Longevity in the Left Palace of the Southern Palace. May I attain transcendence and deliverance, eternally enjoying boundless existence. After achieving the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness, merging with the perfected.

First, facing east, bow nine times, then kneel and declare:

This servant, [so-and-so], now returns life to the Eastern Limitless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage Assemblies of Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Most High Primordial Origin of the Three Heavens’ Supreme Great Dao, the Limitless and Mysterious Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable One, the August Supreme Lord Lao, the August Supreme Venerable One, the Azure Spirit Supreme Perfected, the Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Emperor Venerable Ones, the Supreme Emperors, the Supreme Emperor Venerable Ones, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Lords of the Nine Qi, the myriad layers of Dao qi, the one thousand two hundred officials, the Eastern Pole Elder beneath the Great Clarity’s Jade Palace, the Azure Radiance Great Spirit, the Grand Minister Sima Azure Lad, the Golden Watchtower Posterior Sage Emperor, the True Yang Primordial Azure Divine Person, the Nine Immortal Lords of the Numinous Treasure, their Azure Harmony Jade Maidens, the Jade Lords of the Immortal Hosts, and all divine spirits of the Eastern Limitless Realm. I beseech you to bestow great compassion and merciful pardon, absolving this servant’s sins from past lives, karmic affinities, and present existence—offenses including:

Disrespect toward the Ten Directions’ Great Sage Perfected Ones, the Eastern Limitless Realm’s divine spirits, the sun, moon, stellar lodges, four seasons, five phases, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, clouds, mist, and seasonal nodes; disrespect toward masters, elders, the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, Three Rivers, Four Seas, Nine Rivers, Eight Poles, True Persons, Divine Immortals, Jade Maidens, the Eastern Realm’s spirit officials, the Three Realms’ earth deities, the Three Officials’ nine bureaus, and all divine spirits; deceiving masters and betraying the Dao; defiling sacred scriptures; stealing holy texts; altering divine sounds; disseminating orthodox teachings for personal gain; privately transmitting teachings without the Five Thearchs’ covenant; plotting rebellion; acting disloyally; lacking compassion and filial piety; lacking love and benevolence; rebelling against rulers and fathers; slaughtering living beings; seizing others’ property; committing adultery with others’ wives; harming kin; colluding with clans; envying those superior to oneself; contending for fame and rank; duplicity in speech and intent; slandering the worthy; consuming alcohol and meat, polluting the Five Spirits; cursing and invoking maledictions; acting without cause; violating the Eight Precepts’ auspicious days; capricious joy and anger; disdaining orphans and widows; abandoning the elderly; oppressing the poor; favoring the powerful; and all such sins, too numerous to recount. These offenses, accumulated over lifetimes, have bound me inextricably.

Today, by burning incense and returning life to the Eastern Realm, I beseech your great compassion to absolve this servant’s sins from past kalpas to the present, as enumerated above. Grant me a fresh beginning; from this day forth, I vow to reform, obeying precepts and prohibitions without transgression. I pray that my name be erased from the earthly registers, the Three Officials’ sin records, the Right Palace’s Black Ledgers, and the roots of karmic adversity, transferring my record to the Green Ledgers of the Left Palace. On this day of great celebration, I humbly present my myriad wishes, repenting and returning life to the Heavenly Worthy. I beseech the divine and immortal, merging with the perfected, flourishing my household, cultivating good affinities for future lives, and eternally enjoying the natural state without end.

Having completed this, he loosens his headscarf and kowtows, striking his breast ninety times each. After concluding his thanks to the Eastern Realm, he rises and moves leftward, bowing once toward the southeast. Kneeling upright, he declares:

"I, servant Jia, now surrender my life to the Southeast, to the Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, to the perfected hosts of attained great sages and most true divine spirits, to the Southern Supreme Lord Lao, to the Cinnabar Spirit Lord Lao, to the Southern Culmen Supreme Primordial Perfected of Long Life, to the Life-Measuring, Life-Commanding, and Life-Recording Lords of Salvation, to the Lord Han of Good Life, to those who resurrect the dead and revive the living, refine bones to restore spirit, and to the great sage divine kings, to the Lord of Myriad Blessings, to the Venerable of Myriad Spirits, to the Jade Maidens of Supreme Harmony, and to all divine spirits of the Southeast’s boundless realm—I beseech and give thanks as in the Eastern method."

Having finished, he kowtows and strikes his breast twelve times each. After concluding his thanks to the Southeast, he rises and moves leftward, bowing three times toward the south. Kneeling upright, he declares:

Having finished, he kowtows and strikes his breast seventy times each. After concluding his thanks to the Western Realm, he moves leftward, bowing twice toward the northwest. Kneeling upright, he declares:

"I, servant Jia, now surrender my life to the Northwest’s Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, to the perfected hosts of attained great sages and most true divine spirits, to the Boundless Great Dao’s Emperor, to the True August Elder, to the Flying Heavenly Divine King, to the Ascended Perfected and Supreme Sages, to the Supervising Spirit Perfected, to the divine immortals and jade maidens, and to all divine spirits of the Northwest’s boundless realm—I beseech and give thanks as in the method above."

When finished, he kowtows and strikes his breast twenty times each.

He then bows twice toward the south, kneeling to say: "Your servant so-and-so now surrenders his fate to the Great Divine Lord of the Vermilion Emperor of Mount Heng in the Southern Marchmount, to the Flying Immortals and Perfected, to the divine officials and spirits of the various sacred peaks, and to all divine spirits of the great mountains and marshes—I beseech as in the method for the Eastern Marchmount."

He then bows twice toward the southwest, kneeling to say: "Your servant so-and-so now surrenders his fate to the Great Divine Lord of the Yellow Emperor of Mount Song in the Central Marchmount, to the Flying Immortals and Perfected, to the divine officials and spirits of the various sacred peaks, and to all divine spirits of the great mountains and marshes—I beseech as in the method for the Eastern Marchmount."

He then bows twice toward the west, kneeling to say: "Your servant so-and-so now surrenders his fate to the Great Divine Lord of the White Emperor of Mount Hua in the Western Marchmount, to the Flying Immortals and Perfected, to the divine officials and spirits of the various sacred peaks, and to all divine spirits of the great mountains and marshes—I beseech as in the method for the Eastern Marchmount."

He then bows twice toward the north, kneeling to say: "Your servant so-and-so now surrenders his fate to the Great Divine Lord of the Dark Emperor of Mount Heng in the Northern Marchmount, to the Flying Immortals and Perfected, to the divine officials and spirits of the various sacred peaks, and to all divine spirits of the great mountains and marshes—I beseech as in the method for the Eastern Marchmount."

Having given thanks to the Five Marchmounts in the manner of the Eastern Marchmount—changing only the names of the respective marchmounts—he kowtows and strikes his breast twenty times each.

Having given thanks to the Five Marchmounts, he then proceeds to the left and bows twelve times toward the north, giving thanks to the Water Officials, saying: "Your servant so-and-so now surrenders his fate to the Divine King of Bright Valley in Fusang, to the Great Divine Lords of the Pristine Cold of the Cavern Sources and Cavern Abysses, to the Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Jiang, to the River Lords of the Twelve River Sources, to the River Earls, to the Two Thousand Stone Officials of the Rivers, to the Lady of the Clear River, and to all divine officials of the Water Palaces—I beseech that the countless transgressions and debts accrued from this servant’s past lives to the present day, which have offended the Water Officials, be pardoned and absolved. Today, as I burn incense and offer this first repentance, I surrender my fate to the great divine lords of the Water Palaces, beseeching life and deliverance from all karmic roots of transgression, that my name be inscribed in the registers of immortals and my life prolonged without end, merging with the Dao in perfection." He kowtows and strikes his breast two hundred and eighty times each.

Having given thanks to the Water Palaces, he then bows three times toward the north, giving thanks to the Three Treasures of the Divine Scriptures, kneeling to say: "Your servant so-and-so now surrenders his fate to the Supreme Boundless Dao of the Utmost Perfected, to the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures, to the Three Treasures of the Numinous Texts, to the talismanic registers and divine charts of the immortals, to the natural celestial writings, to the golden and jade characters, to the jade lads and jade maidens who attend the scriptures, and to the majestic deities of the Three Divisions—I beseech and give thanks as in the method above for the Eastern Marchmount." When finished, he kowtows and strikes his breast three hundred and sixty times each.

Having given thanks, he proceeds to the left and, facing east, offers incense three times, praying: "To the Incense Officials and Envoys, to the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, to those who bear the incense, to the courier dragon riders—may you now cause this pure chamber and fasting hall to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar essence, and mushroom efflorescence, and may the hundred spirits gather here before this incense fire. May I attain the Dao and achieve divine transcendence, may my household receive ten thousand blessings, may the world be graced with favor, and may the jade lads and jade maidens of the ten directions, who attend and guard the incense smoke, transmit this servant’s entreaty directly to the presence of the Supreme Dao of the Boundless."

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: The supreme method of repentance and absolution through the Three Primes’ precepts is concealed within the Three Prime Palaces. By concentrating one’s spirit and refining the roots of transgression, those who study the Dao and seek transcendence should practice this thrice yearly. In performing this, one must ensure that the cinnabar of the heart and the intent of the mind are fully devoted, that spirit and form endure hardship together, and that no weariness arises. Thus shall one move the myriad heavens, the Three Primes erase sins from the Black Register, the Northern Emperor remove death and restore life, the Three Officials endorse one’s merits, and the Supreme Mystery record them among the Perfected Transcendents.

*The Rites of the Golden Register Retreat, from Scroll Fifty-Three of the* Supreme Mystery’s Secret Essentials.

The Most High Dao Lord bows his head and respectfully addresses the Heavenly Venerable One, saying: "Now having heard the Flying Celestial Divine Persons expound on the karmic retribution of sins and blessings, and the deliverance of the highest grade, I present my supplications, rites of gratitude, and petitions for absolution of past-life roots. May the men and women of future generations receive this grace, universally attain enlightenment, and enter into radiant illumination. Though this be so, there remain other methods. I do not know whether, when heaven sends down severe calamities, the nation’s mandate is unsettled, the stellar lodges deviate from their courses, the four qi lose their regularity, armies and bandits bring distress, the emperor finds no peace, pestilential toxins spread, and heavenly and human beings suffer death and injury—what methods should be employed to avert these disasters, deliver beings from peril, and resolve all inauspicious omens? I humbly beseech your divine instruction, that we may practice accordingly, harmonize heaven and stabilize the earth, and render service to the state. If we receive your teachings and commands, then grace will spread throughout the ten directions, the nation’s mandate will be securely established, the emperor will flourish, heavenly and human beings will rejoice in peace, and blessings will be boundless. In future generations, all will universally hear the sound of the Dharma."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Venerable One addressed the Flying Celestial Divine Persons, saying: "As for the karmic retribution of sins and blessings and the deliverance of the highest grade that you have expounded—whatever has not yet been fully set forth for the salvation of the nation and the relief of disasters, illnesses, and perils—you may now explain it all in detail to the Most High Dao Lord, so that those who have not seen may see, those who have not heard may hear, and all beings may be universally saved, enabling the multitude to attain clarity."

At this, the instructions were given, and the essential teachings were reverently received.

The Flying Celestial Divine Persons said: "In the *Luminous Statutes of the Jade Treasury of the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Repository*, when the lord of the nation and the land face disasters, illnesses, military threats, and perilous calamities, one should inscribe in cinnabar the five sections of the *Numinous Treasure True Writ* in the central courtyard. Five altars are arranged in the five directions, with one section of the True Writ placed upon each. Five *liang* of gold are used, one *liang* fashioned into one dragon, so that five *liang* form five dragons, to be placed above the five sections of the True Writ. Additionally, five-colored patterned silks are offered as tokens to pacify the Five Emperors. For those afflicted by calamity, according to their age, purple-patterned silk is presented to deliver their lives, stabilize the nation, secure the mandate, and avert heavenly disasters, while the bright stars and stellar lodges are set right.

In spring, nine lamps are lit, or ninety lamps, or nine hundred lamps. In summer, three lamps are lit, or thirty lamps, or three hundred lamps. In autumn, seven lamps are lit, or seventy lamps, or seven hundred lamps. In winter, five lamps are lit, or fifty lamps, or five hundred lamps. During the months of the four seasons, twelve lamps are lit, or one hundred twenty lamps, or one thousand two hundred lamps. Furthermore, a long lamp, nine feet in height, is installed above. Nine lamp flames are arranged in the center to illuminate the *Long Night’s Repository* of the Nine Dark Realms. The enlightened Great Dharma Master, standing in the center, loosens his hair and scatters ashes, following the instructions and performing the six-hour rites of supplication and gratitude. If devout men and women assist the state with prayers, they should loosen their hair, scatter ashes, and present their supplications outside the gate. In spring, this is done for nine days and nine nights; in summer, for three days and three nights..."

In autumn, this is done for seven days and seven nights; in winter, for five days and five nights; during the months of the four seasons, for twelve days and twelve nights. Arraying radiant light to illuminate the boundless worlds of the myriad heavens within the Long Night, the Nine Dark Realms are thus opened and illuminated, their light extending without end. The Three Luminaries shine brightly, heaven and earth are at peace, the stellar lodges return to their positions, the four seasons harmonize, all calamities dissolve, warfare and pestilence cease, heaven and humanity rejoice in prosperity, and the imperial destiny flourishes.

When the day’s ritual circuit is complete, the true writs are burned, and their ashes scattered upon the blue smoke. The flying celestial beings declare: The Dharma Master enters through the Earth Gate, circumambulates the incense and lamps three times, then stands facing east and strikes his teeth thirty-two times. This done, he recites the incense-lighting invocation, and the cantor intones the names and titles of all present.

The Great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns, the Lesser Manifestation Perfected Person, your subject So-and-so, respectfully addresses: the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Vacuity and Spontaneity, the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the August Jade Emperor, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Purity Lord of Heaven, the Great Jade Emperor, the Eastern Flower, the Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous, the Northern Perfected, the Jade Capital of the Dark Metropolis, the Seven Treasures of the Golden Watchtower, the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Mystic Terrace, and the August Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure—Perfected and Radiant Lord of the Dao.

By the karmic conditions of my former lives, I was born into the Dharma Gate. Through the mysterious and true initiation, I entered the root of faith. My former masters transmitted to me the sacred scriptures of the Three Treasures, enabling me to deliver ninety-nine thousand nine hundred persons and ascend to the rank of Highest Perfection. From my ancestors through to my present existence, I have encountered the scriptural teachings and dwelt constantly within blessings. Yet my merits are slight, and I have not attained immortality. With my body and life, I dedicate myself to the service of the state. Now the land has lost its harmony, warfare and disease arise together, yin and yang are obstructed and clash, the stellar lodges move erratically, grave disasters and dire calamities press heavily—all as described in the petition.

Truly, the Emperor has received the celestial mandate to oversee the myriad people, yet he has not extended his beneficence to moisten the ten directions, causing heaven and humanity to lack abundance and the state to fail in great peace. Without songs of praise for his grace, the roads resound with lamentation, leading the Three Luminaries to darken and err, and celestial disasters to spread. The Emperor, anxious for the people’s unrest, now reverently follows the Great Dharma: he reveals the true writs, burns incense, and kindles lamps to illuminate the myriad heavens. With sincere vows, he performs the ritual circuit to express gratitude and dispel misfortune.

He respectfully summons:
- The celestial immortals’ troops and cavalry, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The terrestrial immortals’ troops and cavalry, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The Perfected Ones’ troops and cavalry, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The flying immortals’ troops and cavalry, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The divine immortals’ troops and cavalry, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The sun and moon’s troops and cavalry, nine kinds, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The stellar lodges’ troops and cavalry, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The Nine Palaces’ troops and cavalry, ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The Five Emperors’ troops and cavalry, each ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The Five Marchmounts’ troops and cavalry, each ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The Three Rivers and Four Seas’ troops and cavalry, each ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million strong;
- The thirty-two heavenly overseers of the fast, thirty-two in number;
- The thirty-two golden lads attending incense;
- The thirty-two jade maidens scattering flowers;
- The thirty-two direct talismans of the Five Emperors, each thirty-two in number;
- The flying dragon couriers and messengers, and all others—descend together to oversee the ritual hall, receive the incense vows, and transmit the spoken prayers upward. When the ritual circuit is complete, those who have rendered meritorious service may report to the immortal officials.

Then, facing east, he offers incense three times and prays:
The Great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns, the Lesser Manifestation Perfected Person, your subject So-and-so, now establishes this upright incense offering. May these merits extend to the Emperor, the lords of the state, the ministers, officials, and people, and to the seven generations of parents throughout the world, that they may depart from sorrow and suffering and ascend to the celestial halls. Now, offering this incense, I dedicate my body, spirit, and life to the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow to the seven generations of parents throughout the world, that they may be delivered from the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, ascend to the celestial halls, be clothed and fed by spontaneity, and dwell forever in non-action.

Now, offering this incense, I dedicate myself to the virtue of the Great Sage Perfected Ones, the Masters and Venerables. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

Next, he takes incense three more times and prays:
Your subject now offers this incense. May these merits extend to the Emperor, the lords of the state, the ministers, officials, and people, the Dharma Masters who have received the teachings, parents and honored kin, fellow disciples, and all worthy Daoists dwelling in mountains and forests to study the true Way. May each attain the Dao. I dedicate my body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.

Your subject prostrates body and head to the ground and dedicates his life to the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow to the Emperor, the lords of the state, the ministers, officials, and people, the Dharma Masters who have received the teachings, parents and kin, fellow disciples, and all worthy Daoists dwelling in mountains and forests to study the true Way. May each attain the Dao, dwell in non-action, and long enjoy blessings and prosperity.

Now, offering this incense, I dedicate myself to the virtue of the Great Sage Perfected Ones, the Masters and Venerables. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

Next, he takes incense three more times and prays:
Your subject now establishes this upright incense offering. May these merits swiftly grant me the immortal Dao, and extend to my ninefold kin, fellow Dharma students within the state, all people under heaven, and all living beings—winged, creeping, slithering, or breathing—whether already born or yet to be born. May all be perfected. I dedicate my body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.

Your subject prostrates body and head to the ground and dedicates his life to the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High. May these merits flow to my person, that I may attain immortal deliverance and ultimately enter non-action, uniting with the virtue of the Four Great Elements. May all people under heaven and all living beings be delivered from the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, the five poisons, water and fire, disease and pestilence, demonic harm, and dire calamities. May the land be at peace and the world flourish.

Now, offering this incense, I dedicate myself to the virtue of the Great Sage Perfected Ones, the Masters and Venerables. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

After completing the three incense offerings and vows, he faces east and bows nine times, saying:

When heaven and earth are obstructed and in turmoil, when yin and yang clash and punish one another, when the four seasons lose their harmony, when inauspicious disasters spread and arise, when the celestial bodies entangle in disorder to foretell misfortune—then the land knows no peace, war and disease rage together, the sovereign is filled with dread, and the myriad people find no rest. Reverently following the Great Law, I now reveal the true scripture, dedicating myself to the Limitless Heavenly Worthy of the East, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the spirit officials of the eastern quarter. Today, I establish this fast, baring my heart and revealing my form, prostrating myself in repentance. For the sake of the realm, I offer expiation for calamities, burning incense and kindling lamps to illuminate the heavens above and cast light into the boundless, eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms below, opening all paths to radiance.

May these merits extend to the emperor and lords of the land, to ministers, officials, and the common people, dispelling disasters and averting misfortune. May the Three Luminaries return to their proper places, the Five Phases flow in harmony, wars cease, diseases heal, the fortunes of the state flourish, and the myriad people rejoice in peace. May humans and spirits alike dwell in tranquility.

Now, I bare my heart and dedicate myself to the virtue of the Great Sage Perfected Ones, the Masters and Venerables. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao.

This done, he removes his headscarf, prostrates himself, and strikes his breast eighty-one times. Then, facing south, he bows three times, making vows as above. He now dedicates himself to the Limitless Heavenly Worthy of the South, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the spirit officials of the southern quarter. After the vows, he prostrates himself and strikes his breast twenty-seven times. Next, facing west, he bows seven times, making vows as above. He now dedicates himself to the Limitless Heavenly Worthy of the West, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords, and the spirit officials of the western quarter. After the vows, he prostrates himself and strikes his breast sixty-three times. Then, facing north, he bows five times, making vows as above. He now dedicates himself to the Limitless Heavenly Worthy of the North, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Five Qi Heavenly Lords, and the spirit officials of the northern quarter. After the vows, he prostrates himself and strikes his breast forty-five times. Next, facing northeast, he bows once, making vows as above. He now dedicates himself to the Limitless Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Heavenly Lords of Pure Qi, and the spirit officials of the northeastern quarter. After the vows, he prostrates himself and strikes his breast nine times. Then, facing southeast, and then southwest...

Facing northwest, he bows once at each of the four corners, striking his breast and cheeks nine times each, making vows in the manner of the northeast. Next, facing the northwest upper quarter, he bows thirty-two times, making vows as above. He now dedicates himself to the Limitless Heavenly Worthies of the Thirty-Two Heavens above, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Lords Imperial of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Perfected Ones of the Jade Capital, Mystic Metropolis, and Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, and the jade maidens, divine immortals, and spirit officials. After the vows, he prostrates himself and strikes his breast two hundred eighty times.

Next, facing the southeast lower quarter, he bows twelve times, making vows as above. He now dedicates himself to the Limitless Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy below, the Great Sage Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Lords and Elders, the Four Directors and Five Emperors of the Nine Lands, the Twelve Immortal Officials, the Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, and Nine Palaces, the divine immortals and jade maidens, and the spirit officials of the Nine Earths of the Limitless World. After the vows, he prostrates himself and strikes his breast one hundred twenty times.

When the vows and invocations to the ten directions are complete, he circumambulates three times, circling the incense and lamps, reciting the *Dongzhang* of the *Bu Xu* as he paces. When finished, he returns to face east and resumes the incense offering with a prayer.

The Flying Heavenly Divine Persons say: The number of days for performing the Dao may be adjusted as appropriate. Though human affairs follow the four seasons, the number of days accords with the five phases. Even three days and three nights of earnest supplication, with a sincere heart, may move the various heavens. Scholars may measure their capacity and act accordingly.

—From the *Scripture of Luminous Perfection and Clarity* as recorded in *The Supreme Secret Essentials*, Scroll Fifty-Three, concluded.

**Establishing the Altar Platform – The Yellow Register Petition and the Numinous Immortals Section states:**

For the ritual of delivering souls from the roots of sin, an altar shall be opened in the central courtyard. The four cardinal directions, four corners, and the upper and lower realms together form ten gates. The central area shall be measured two *zhang* and four *chi* in length and breadth. On all four sides, banners shall be erected to mark the positions of the gates, with the upper and lower realms properly arranged.

After the lamps are installed at the gate banners, nine lamps shall be placed in each of the ten directions, totaling ninety lamps, positioned outside the Grand Gates.

**Incense:**
One incense burner shall be placed at each gate, totaling ten incense burners. Attendants shall tend the incense, ensuring its smoke rises uninterrupted to summon the divine *qi*.

**Dragon Talismans:**
Ten golden dragons shall be crafted to suppress the ten directions, delivering the sinful souls. One shall be placed in each direction.

**Life-Destiny Silks:**
The patron shall provide silks bearing the patterns of their life destiny according to their year of birth. Kings and princes shall use purple silks to emulate the celestial patterns, while commoners shall use the color corresponding to their life destiny’s proper direction, placing them at the center for the deliverance of their year and destiny.

According to each direction’s corresponding color, arrange them in the ten directions to deliver the souls of the eternal night.
The Son of Heaven shall use bolts of silk, princes and kings shall use zhang measures, and commoners shall use chi measures—rank determines the quantity, all in accordance with the established regulations.

**Assigning Roles:**
Once all arrangements are complete, invite one Dharma Master to perform the ritual at the center, accompanied by four fellow practitioners. According to rank, appoint one to oversee the retreat, one to manage affairs, one to tend the incense, and one to tend the lamps. At the main gate, they shall follow the master in procession as the patron kneels and prays for deliverance, mutually aiding in the salvation of sins.
The master enters through the Earth Gate, circling left to the center, then proceeds around the incense burners to the western side, facing east to offer incense thrice.
Next, to the southeast, offering incense thrice; then to the south, thrice; then to the southwest, thrice; then to the west, thrice; then to the northwest, thrice; then to the north, thrice; then to the northeast, thrice; then to the upper direction, thrice; and finally to the lower direction, thrice.
After completing the ten directions, return to the western side, standing and facing east.
The disciples also enter through the Earth Gate, circling left at the main gate, following the master to offer incense thrice in each of the ten directions. Upon completion, they return inside the main gate and stand facing east.

**Incense Invocation:**
The master stands at the center, striking the teeth twenty-four times, and invokes:
*"Incense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Fragrant-Bearing Courier Dragon Riders, Incense-Attending Golden Lads, Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants—thirty-six each—summon the true officials of this land and domain to swiftly prepare. I now burn incense and perform the Dao, praying that the supreme *qi* of the Ten Directions’ true and orthodox beings enter my body, that my entreaties swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, Boundless, Great Dao, the Utmost True Jade Emperor of the Heavenly Thearchs."*

**Inviting the Immortals:**
*"I now invoke the celestial immortals’ troops and horses, earthly immortals’ troops and horses, flying immortals’ troops and horses, perfected beings’ troops and horses, divine beings’ troops and horses, sun and moon troops and horses, stellar constellations’ troops and horses, Nine Palaces’ troops and horses, Five Thearchs’ troops and horses, Three Rivers and Four Seas’ troops and horses, Five Peaks and Four Waterways’ troops and horses—each with ninety million myriad riders. I summon thirty-two overseers of the retreat, thirty-two attendants for affairs, Incense-Attending Golden Lads, Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants—thirty-two each—along with message-bearing officials, flying dragon couriers, and all others to descend and oversee this retreat hall. Together with my fellow practitioners, I perform this ritual for the patron [Name], delivering the nine generations of their ancestors’ departed souls from the eternal night. The patron now offers this retreat in sincerity, pledging devotion to the boundless worlds’ perfected and sagely hosts, the venerable masters, and the divine officials of the Ten Directions. Today, I burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the great sagely hosts, the Utmost True. May I, upon attaining the Dao, ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao."*

**Threefold Incense Offering:**
Master and disciples circle left together, offering incense thrice to each of the ten directions, beginning in the east and proceeding through the lower direction.

Facing west with the east at their backs, the master recites the invocation for the first incense offering:

*"This first incense is offered for the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors of fellow practitioner [Name], releasing the departed souls from the Nine Dark Vaults of the Jade Repository, the eternal night’s abode—dispelling their karmic adversaries and the deep-rooted sins of past lives. Through the merit of this retreat and incense offering, we beseech and give thanks to the Ten Directions. May the nine generations of ancestors be freed from the depths of suffering, ascend to the Heavenly Palace, and abide in the natural abundance of the Dao. Now, we burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Way.*

*We prostrate ourselves, body and head to the earth, taking refuge in the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. May this merit flow to the nine generations of ancestors, delivering them from the ten sufferings, the eight hardships, and the long night’s bondage. May they behold the radiant light and ascend to the Heavenly Palace, where clothing and sustenance arise spontaneously, and they dwell forever in non-action.*

*Now, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the great sagely hosts, the Utmost True. Upon attaining the Dao, may we ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao."*

After the second incense offering, master and disciples circle left together, offering incense thrice to each of the ten directions, beginning in the east and proceeding through the lower direction.

Facing west with the east at their backs, the master recites the invocation:

*"We now perform this rite for the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors of fellow practitioner [Name], releasing the departed souls from the Nine Dark Vaults of the Jade Repository, the eternal night’s abode—dispelling their karmic adversaries and the deep-rooted sins of past lives. Through the merit of this retreat and incense offering, we beseech and give thanks to the Ten Directions. May the nine generations of ancestors be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the Heavenly Palace, and surrender body, spirit, and life to the Great Way.*

*We prostrate ourselves, body and head to the earth, taking refuge in the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. May this merit flow to the emperors and kings of the realm, to ministers and officials, to those who receive the Dao and its teachings, to parents and revered kin, to fellow disciples, to reclusive scholars in the mountains and forests who study the true Way, and to all worthy Daoists. May each attain their Dao and dwell in peace, abiding in non-action.*

*Now, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the great sagely hosts, the Utmost True. Upon attaining the Dao, may we ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao."*

After the third incense offering, master and disciples circle left together, offering incense thrice to each of the ten directions, beginning in the east and proceeding through the lower direction.

Facing west with the east at their backs, the master recites the invocation:

*"We now perform this rite for the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors of fellow practitioner [Name], releasing the departed souls from the Nine Dark Vaults of the Jade Repository, the eternal night’s abode—dispelling their karmic adversaries and the deep-rooted sins of past lives. Through the merit of this retreat and incense offering, we beseech and give thanks to the Ten Directions. May the nine generations of ancestors be freed from sorrow and suffering and ascend to the Heavenly Palace. May [Name] swiftly attain transcendence, and may their household, clan, and kin—along with the realm’s officials and people, all fellow students and teachers, those who have received grace, disciples, the people of the world, creatures that creep and crawl, those that fly and burrow, those that wriggle and breathe, all beings born and unborn—be delivered from the ten sufferings, the eight hardships, the five poisons, water and fire, the thousand calamities and myriad harms, demonic afflictions, ghostly qi, punishments, and misfortunes.*

*Now, we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the great sagely hosts, the Utmost True. Upon attaining the Dao, may we ascend into formlessness and unite with the true Dao."*

After the three incense offerings are complete, they give thanks to the Ten Directions.

The master and disciples together bow nine times toward the east, then kneel and say: "Fellow practitioner, the nine generations of ancestors of so-and-so, for the transgressions they committed in their lifetimes, have had their sins bound in the Nine Dark Halls of the Long Night. Their souls endure flogging and torment, suffering every agony, their forms broken and withered, their pain unbearable. They have sunk into eternal kalpas, with no end in sight.

May the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, convey our entreaties, and ascend directly to the presence of the Boundless, Most High Great Dao."

The *Lingxian Section of the Yellow Register Writs of the Lower Prime* states: "When the rites of deliverance and the expression of gratitude to the divine majesties are complete, one should follow the jade instructions and cast a golden dragon, inscribing a jade tablet with cinnabar, binding it with blue silk, and sealing it as a token of ascent for the Five Emperors and the transcendent immortals, placing it within an abyssal cliff, strictly adhering to the ancient method."

The *Lingxian Section of the Yellow Register Writs of the Lower Prime* further states: "When the rites invoking the Five Emperors are complete, inscribe a jade tablet with cinnabar, cast a golden dragon, bind it with blue silk to a stone, and sink it into the Three Rivers to invoke the Water Emperors. This serves as the token of ascent, strictly following the jade instructions of the ancient text."

**Supreme Secret Essentials, Scroll Fifty-Five**
**The Lower Prime Purification Rites of the Great Perfected**

For those who study the methods of the Great Perfected and seek to become flying immortals, achieve spiritual communion with the true, soar through the vast heavens, and ascend to the Nine Heavens, they must observe the purification rites of the Lower Prime on its third day. They should burn incense, recite scriptures, and deliver their seven generations of ancestors, allowing the deceased souls to be reborn, escape the Three Paths, ascend to the Southern Palace, release their karmic knots, dissolve their obstructions, sever their evil roots. When the seven generations rejoice, the practitioner themselves will attain immortality. This method is profound and wondrous; it must not be transmitted to the unworthy.

For the Lower Prime purification rites, one day prior, bathe the body and purify the mind with a night of fasting. The number of participants may range from nine down to three.

Upon entering the chamber at night, face north, click the teeth fourteen times, and offer incense three times. Kneeling, they invoke:

"Most High, Empty and Spontaneously Arising Ninefold Mystery Dao Lord; Void Sovereign Great Perfected; Lower Prime Purification Officials; Five Directions and Five Emperors; Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks—on this day of the present month, at such-and-such a place, we observe the purification vigil, burning incense and lighting lamps, reciting scriptures. We humbly request the Lower Prime Inspectors of the Perfected, the Purification Vigil Immortal Officials, and the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—twelve each—to descend together, oversee our rites, and report above to the Nine Heavens. We respectfully prepare this night’s invocation to be conveyed directly for your enactment."

Upon completion, at dawn the next day, they enter the chamber, arranging themselves by rank. The purification master first clicks their teeth three times outside the chamber door, visualizing the chamber filled with spontaneously arising purple *qi* clouds, with Jade Lads and Jade Maidens arrayed to the left and right.

In a soft voice, they say: "As we now enter the chamber to burn incense and perform the Dao, may the Purification Vigil Immortal Officials protect our bodies, connect us to the mysterious void, and report our every movement."

They then enter, face east toward the incense burner, and invoke:

"Primal Spirits of the Lower Prime, Divine Perfected of the Five Emperors, Golden Immortals and Jade Lads, Pure Spirits and Jade Maidens, attendants of the left and right incense, Flying Immortal Divine Officials—we open the gates of the Nine Heavens to the Primordial Heavenly King, the Void Sovereign Jade Emperor, and the Most High Heavenly Worthies. As we now burn incense, circumambulate, and recite the scriptures, may the *qi* of the Boundless, Spontaneous, and Utmost True descend into our bodies, receive our secret words, and swiftly convey our entreaties to the presence of the August Jade Emperor on High."

Turning left to face north, they kneel, click their teeth twelve times, and visualize:

"From the four limbs, five constituents, and thirty-nine portals of our bodies, the Perfected Divine Officials, the Left and Right Flying Immortals, the Jade Void Attendants, the Five Emperors and Five-Colored Primal August Perfected, the Flying Dragon Merit Officers, and the Divine Immortal Messengers—thirty-six each—emerge. The Jade Void Attendants wield the nine-colored, radiant heavenly banners of the Flying Immortals’ feathered standards. The Five Emperors and Five-Colored Primal August Perfected hold the life-demon banners of the Five Emperors. The Flying Dragon Merit Officers wear feathered robes adorned with golden true phoenix emblems. The Divine Immortal Messengers interlace the Seven Primes and hold jade tablets, standing before us to receive our secret words. Mounting the golden-rooted, purple-canopied, cinnabar-axled, jade-charioted flying cloud wheels, accompanied by the Golden Immortals and Jade Lads, the Great Flower Jade Maidens—twelve each—and the left and right Dragon-Tiger soaring heavenly feathered riders, two hundred forty thousand in number, we fly to the Purple Canopy, ascending to the golden gates, jade halls, jeweled chambers, and cinnabar rooms of the Nine Heavens.

When finished, turn again to the west, knock the teeth three times, and pray as before.

The Great Dao pervades the subtle and profound,
The lofty void encompasses the Three Wheels.
Golden Immortals open the numinous gate,
Radiant as the Nine Heavens parted.
Great Hua scatters purple through the sky,
Eight Perfected shine upon the white clouds.
The Mysterious Mother weaves the highest vow,
Amid the Eight Gates of practice.
Myriad blessings converge in the numinous assembly,
Incense smoke rises as the Lower Prime is chanted.
Wondrous recitation stirs the layered void,
Binding the company of lofty immortals.
Wandering in reverence through the empty cavern,
Bow the head to the Lord of the Empire.

When finished, bow twice, swallow qi three times, and cease.

The *Lower Prime Chapter* states: At this time, one should recite the Nine Heavens’ Verses from the *Tai Xiao Lang Shu* while circumambulating the incense three times. Facing north from the south, perform nine bows in total. When all is complete, depart without looking back. The observance of mealtimes, rest, recitation, and devotion during the three periods shall follow the method of the Upper Prime. When the three-day retreat concludes, report to the retreat officer, also in accordance with the Upper Prime’s protocol, but with the added merit of liberating the seven generations of ancestors.

The *Lower Prime Chapter* states: When conducting this retreat, one should inscribe the *Seven Primes’ August Sovereigns’ Mighty Talisman* and place it in the appropriate direction.

The *Three Primes Chapter* states: On the day of the retreat, select a person of high repute, spiritually attuned, adept in subtle teachings, and luminous in wisdom to serve as the retreat master. They shall ascend the high seat and expound the Dharma, while the next in rank shall harmonize. All participants in the retreat shall sit in silent attendance, reverently receiving the transformation of the Dao. None shall act with negligence, outwardly feigning retreat while inwardly harboring divergent thoughts, thus violating the celestial statutes. Those who do so shall be seized by the officers of the law and punished with the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors, their names transferred to the Northern Feng, and they shall not again ascend the retreat hall.

The *Three Primes Chapter* states: On the day of the retreat, men and women shall be arranged according to the depth of their learning. They shall walk with refined dignity, circumambulate the incense, and make vows in proper order. In sitting, rising, reclining, and resting, none shall mix indiscriminately or engage in jesting, disregarding seniority. Those who do so shall be mocked by the heavens and disdained by spirits. Such offenders shall be seized by the officers of the law and punished with the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors, their names transferred to the Northern Feng, and they shall not again ascend the retreat hall.

The *Three Primes Chapter* states: Whenever fellow students encounter misfortune, illness, official entanglements, slander, or unjust calamities, they shall practice the method of "nothing within." They should prepare incense and oil as offerings and make a petition. The retreat master shall then report their circumstances to the lofty void in accordance with the matter at hand.

The *Three Primes Chapter* states: In all undertakings of this Dao—whether studying the method, holding a retreat, compounding the elixir, entering the mountains, transmitting scriptures, observing the eight seasonal nodes, the days of *jiazi*, *gengshen*, the Grand Year-star, or one’s own fate-day—whether in wealth or poverty, joy or sorrow, illness or slander, distress or peril, or when one’s teacher is in distress, the nation is unsettled, one’s teacher is in peril, or a fellow practitioner is in sorrow—one must always hold a retreat. The merit of such practice is most profound. If one can persist in this method regularly, after three years, a True Person shall descend. By maintaining this practice for nine years, one shall attain the power to ride the void and fly. This Dao is secret and weighty; guard it well and do not transmit it recklessly.

The *Three Primes Chapter* states: The *Tai Zhen Canon*, received by the Most High Primordial Lord in the empty cavern before the Nine Mysteries, is to be employed during the retreat to practice the formulas of immortality. Thus, the True Persons of the Upper Chamber of the Mysterious Capital all observe the Upper Prime in the first ten-day period of the month, the Middle Prime in the middle ten-day period, and the Lower Prime in the last ten-day period. How much more should worldly students strive to practice the Dao of the Three Primes? Mere idle contemplation of its subtleties will never summon the True. Vain effort in practice will only distance one from immortality. If one is sincere, one should follow the luminous canon, present thirty feet of brocade silk and nine gold rings to one’s teacher, and take a vow to receive the ordination of a True Person. After nine years of practice, one shall attain the rank of Flying Immortal and ascend to the Jade Purity Palace. To lightly divulge these treasured texts is to invite the death of one’s seven generations of ancestors, the loss of one’s own life, and the forfeiture of immortality.

*Wushang Biyao*, Scroll Fifty-Five, concludes.
*Wushang Biyao*, Scroll Fifty-Six.

**The Rite of the Great Perfection’s Middle Prime Retreat**

The *Canon of the Great Perfection* is the foundation of study. One must first practice the method of the Middle Prime Retreat to atone for the accumulated transgressions of one’s body, resolve offenses before the Great Perfection, and seek absolution from the Three Primes. Once past sins are dispersed, the Most High shall descend the True, inscribe one’s name upon the Mysterious Chart, and enable attainment of Highest Immortality. Without this method, one’s efforts are vain and merit is lost, failing to move the spontaneous. Those who cultivate this Way shall ascend to the Nine Heavens; to lightly divulge its sacred texts is to forfeit one’s life to the Bureau of Ghosts.

**Method for Practicing the Middle Prime Retreat:**
On the eve of the rite, bathe and purify yourself. Enter the chamber, burn incense, face west, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Pass the incense thrice through the flame, then kneel and invoke:

*To the August Jade Emperor of the Nine Mysteries, the Dao Lord of the Great Perfection, and the Most High Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Middle Prime: Your servant, on this day of the present month, undertakes this retreat, burning incense and lighting lamps to repent transgressions and seek absolution. May the divine officials of the Middle Prime, the Five Directions, the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Flying Immortals, Inspecting Perfected Envoys, Retreat-Guarding Immortal Officials, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens—twenty-four each—deign to descend and witness, shielding this servant’s body, conveying his arts to the True, and reporting his plea to the Nine Heavens.*

Having made this solemn invocation, await the dawn. At daybreak, enter the chamber, knock the teeth thrice outside the retreat hall, and visualize the hall filled with spontaneous purple *qi*, its essence brimming with divine mushrooms and cinnabar radiance, while Jade Lads and Jade Maidens array themselves to left and right.

Whisper:
*As I enter this chamber to burn incense and perform the Dao, may the Retreat-Guarding Immortal Officials shield this servant’s body, ensuring all movements and stillness reach the Mysterious Void.*

Proceed into the retreat hall, face east toward the incense burner, and pray:
*To the Five Numinous Ones, the Five Elders, the Divine Perfected, the Golden Immortals, the Jade Lads, the Jade Maidens of Mount Taihua, the Left and Right Dragon-Tigers, and the Incense-Attending Immortal Officials: I beseech the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Heavenly King of Original Commencement, the Jade Emperor of the Void Sovereign, and the Most High Heavenly Worthies. As I burn incense and circumambulate the scriptures, may the boundless, spontaneous, and true *qi* of the Middle Prime descend into my body, receive the secret words from my mouth, and swiftly convey my plea to the throne of the Most High Jade Emperor.*

Face east, kneel, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Then solemnly summon:
*From within my body’s fivefold true officials, the Jade Gate’s Purple Portal, the thirty-nine passes’ Perfected Immortal Officials, the Left and Right Flying Immortals, the Jade Void Attendants, the Five Emperors of the Five Colored Primordial Perfection, the Flying Dragon Merit Clerks, and the thirty-six Divine Immortal Envoys—let them emerge!*

The Attendants shall bear the Nine Heavens’ Radiant Banners; the Five Emperors of the Five Colored Primordial Perfection shall wield the Five Emperors’ Commanding Demon Banners; the Flying Dragon Merit Clerks shall wear feathered robes adorned with golden phoenix insignia; the Divine Immortal Envoys shall hold the Seven Primes’ Interlocking Jade Tablets. Standing before me, they shall receive the secret words from my mouth, ascend upon a golden-rooted, purple-canopied, cinnabar-axled, jade-carved cloud chariot, accompanied by twelve Golden Immortals, twelve Jade Maidens of Mount Taihua, twenty-four thousand Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Feathered Cavalry, soaring through the Purple Void to the Golden Gates and Jade Halls, the Jasper Chambers and Cinnabar Sanctums of the Nine Heavens’ summit.

There, I prostrate and invoke:
*To the Utmost Supreme, Boundless, and Ineffable Most High Cavern-True Nine Mysteries Primordial Father; the Great Void Mysterious Mother; the Primordial Heavenly King of Original Commencement; the Most High Jade Void Ten-Thousand-Dao Elder; the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Kings; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Kings; the Ten-Thousand-Beginnings Master; the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads; the Nine Heavens’ Chancellors; the Great Perfection Heavenly Kings; the Most High Thirty-Nine Emperors; the Twenty-Four Jade Sovereigns; the Mysterious Ancient Master; the Ten-Thousand-Beginnings Elder; the Most High Jade Dawn; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Later Sage Golden Gates Emperor; the Divine King of Fusang’s Yang Valley; the Four Offices’ Five Emperors’ Southern Culmen Upper Prime Prohibiting Lords; the Western Terrace’s Tortoise Mother; the Highest Clarity’s Great Perfection Jade Guardian, Prime Minister, Grand Marshal, Life-Commanding High Dawn Master; the Eastern Sea’s Jade Gate Azure Florescence Youth Lord; the Great Clarity’s Primordial Three Heavens’ Boundless Great Dao Most High Lord Lao; the Most High Elder; the Heavenly Emperor Lord; the Nine Elders’ Immortal Capital Lords; the Nine *Qi* Elder; the hundred thousand myriad layers of Dao *qi*’s twelve hundred official lords; the Great Clarity’s Jade Palace’s Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate; the innumerable hosts of Highest August Perfected; the Boundless Heavenly Worthies; the spontaneously flowing *qi*’s Mysterious Capital Primordial Sovereign; and the Three Luminants’ Great Cavern disciples, the humble Perfected of this minor destiny, the Master of [Mount] Yue, your servant [Name], born of impure womb and defiled embryo, yet by karmic fortune and blessed affinity, revolving through the Dharma Gate, I attained human birth. Unworthily, I basked in the High Void’s residual radiance, awakening my dull ignorance, and was granted the sacred texts by my master [Name], who bestowed upon me thirty-one volumes of treasured scriptures. Yet my body remains stained by impurities, unable to ascend in splendor, drifting through the Nine Mysteries, sinking into the lower worlds. My cultivation falters, my conduct accumulates transgressions, and I am seized by the Four Offices, bound to karmic retribution. Daring to rely on the sacred canon, I pledge to receive the Middle Prime Retreat’s texts of the Great Perfection, redeeming past sins. Today, I enter the chamber, ascend the retreat, recite the scriptures, perform the Dao, contemplate the True, burn incense, light lamps, and pay homage to the Jade Heaven, repenting sins and seeking absolution. I aspire to immortality, and humbly beseech the Three Treasures’ Most High to dispatch the Attendant Perfected, the Five Directions’ Five Emperors’ Supervising Numinous Lords, the Retreat-Supervising Great Spirits, the Retreat-Directing Envoys, the Retreat-Guarding Highest Perfected, the Flying Immortals, Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, the Five Peaks’ Divine Immortals, and nine hundred million myriad hosts of cavalry—all to descend as one, shield my body, extinguish demons, dissolve trials, dispel evil, summon the Nine Heavens’ spontaneous true *qi*, the Golden Monad’s liquid cinnabar essence, and divine mushrooms. May the immortals gather in the retreat hall, illuminating my body, while Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attend the incense smoke, enabling my practice to attain the Dao, my quest for immortality to succeed, my flight through the Great Void, and my ascent to the Nine Heavens. May my vows align, merging with the Three Treasures’ truth. May the Middle Prime’s sins be erased, the Great Yin’s thousand transgressions and myriad faults be extinguished, and all be graciously absolved. May my seven ancestors be delivered, their dead souls reborn in heaven, and all the heavens’ beings spared the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, receiving the boundless, immeasurable grace of the Middle Prime’s deliverance.*

Upon the completion of the ritual practice, I petition to return to my original abode, humbly awaiting your swift decree, that it may be reverently carried out.

**Summon the ritual officers and soldiers.**

**First offering of incense before the censer:**
I, [Name], the humble Perfected of Lesser Illumination, Master of the [X] Sacred Peak, and servant of the Dao, now establish this fast and perform the vigil, burning incense and kindling lamps, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao, to absolve past transgressions and offer repentance to the Three Primes. In seeking the divine immortals, I dedicate these merits to deliver my seven generations of parents from sorrow and suffering, that their higher souls may ascend to heaven and dissolve the heavy karmic debts of my thousand ancestors and myriad forebears. Now, I surrender body, spirit, and fate to the Boundless Primordial, the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Supreme Perfected Heavenly Worthy. May these merits flow back to me and my seven ancestors, absolving our thousand sins and myriad faults, that all may graciously receive pardon, escape the Ten Sufferings, and ascend to the immortal palaces.

Thus, I burn this incense, taking refuge in the Most High and Unfathomable Heavenly Worthy, to attain the Dao, ascend as a flying immortal, soar through the Nine Heavens, wander freely in the Golden Towers, and unite with the Three Treasures in truth.

**Second offering of incense:**
I now establish this fast and perform the vigil, burning incense and kindling lamps, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao, to absolve past transgressions and offer repentance to the Three Primes. In seeking the divine immortals, I dedicate these merits to deliver my seven generations of parents from the darkness of suffering, that their higher souls may ascend to heaven and dissolve the heavy karmic debts of my thousand sins and myriad forebears. Now, I surrender body, spirit, and fate to the Boundless and Beginningless, the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Supreme Perfected Heavenly Worthy. May these merits flow back to me and my seven generations of ancestors, absolving our thousand sins and myriad faults, that all may graciously receive pardon. May this great grace extend to all heavens, and may my masters in the Dao, my parents and revered kin, the reclusive scholars of the mountains and forests, and all worthy Daoists universally attain deliverance, escaping the gates of sin.

Thus, I burn this incense, taking refuge in the Most High and Boundless Heavenly Worthy, to attain the Dao, ascend as a flying immortal, soar through the Nine Heavens, wander freely in the Golden Towers, and unite with the Three Treasures in truth.

**Third offering of incense:**
I now establish this fast and perform the vigil, burning incense and kindling lamps, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao, to absolve past transgressions and offer repentance to the Three Primes. In seeking the divine immortals, I dedicate these merits to my household and clan, the nine lineages of kinship, emperors and kings, lords and ministers, officials and commoners, the frontier regions of the four directions, all celestial and earthly beings, and every creature—those that creep and crawl, breathe and sigh—all sentient beings. Now, I surrender body, spirit, and fate to the Boundless Primordial, the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Supreme Perfected Heavenly Worthy. May these merits flow back to me and my household, absolving our thousand sins and myriad faults, that all may graciously receive pardon. May this great grace extend to all heavens, the imperial clan, the nine lineages of kinship, emperors and kings, lords and ministers, officials and commoners, the frontier regions, the people of the world, and all creatures—those already born and yet to be born—universally attain deliverance, each preserving their natural state.

Thus, I burn this incense, taking refuge in the Most High and Boundless Heavenly Worthy, to attain the Dao, ascend as a flying immortal, soar through the Nine Heavens, wander freely in the Golden Towers, and unite with the Three Treasures in truth.

**Facing east, bow three times, then kneel and pray:**
I now perform this fast and vigil, burning incense and kindling lamps, contemplating the true and reciting scriptures, to absolve past transgressions and offer repentance to the Three Primes. I surrender my fate to the Boundless Primordial, the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Supreme Perfected Heavenly Worthy of the East, beseeching your compassionate illumination and pardon for my supplications. Grant that I may study the Dao and attain it, seek immortality and achieve it, fly through the Great Void, and soar through the Nine Heavens. May my seven generations of parents escape the Three Wretched Realms and ascend to the Southern Palace, receiving the grace of the Heavenly Worthy’s deliverance.

Here, I perform three prostrations and three strikes to my cheeks.

**Next, face southeast and repeat the above ritual.**
**Then, face due south and repeat the above ritual.**

Next, face southwest and repeat the above ritual.
Then, face due west and repeat the above ritual.
Then, face northwest and repeat the above ritual.
Then, face due north and repeat the above ritual.
Then, face northeast and repeat the above ritual.
Then, face the northwest upper direction and repeat the above ritual.
Then, face the southeast lower direction and repeat the above ritual.
For all ten directions, follow the same vows as for the eastern direction, performing three prostrations and three strikes to the cheeks to repent for sins across the ten directions. Even if the officiant of the Great Perfection ritual grows weary from prolonged fasting, the heart must still bow in reverence; the prostrations and strikes to the cheeks must not be omitted.

Next, face west and bow twice, then kneel and pray:
I now perform this fast with utmost sincerity, burning incense and lighting lamps, contemplating the true and reciting scriptures, to absolve past transgressions—thousands of faults and myriad errors. I beseech the Supreme Primordial Profound Origin, the Vacuous and Cavernous Great Beginning, the Ninefold Mystic Essence Jade Perfected Lord of the West; the Lofty Sage, Supreme Immortal; the Jade Consort of Tortoise Terrace; and the Jade Void, Supreme Numinous, Boundless Heavenly Worthy. Grant your compassionate illumination and special pardon, that I may study the Dao and attain it, seek immortality and achieve it, fly through the Great Void, and soar through the Nine Heavens. Deliver my seven generations of ancestors, that they may ascend to the Southern Palace, dwell eternally in non-action, and receive sustenance naturally, bestowed with the grace of the Supreme Sages’ deliverance.

Next, face north and bow twice, then kneel and pray:
I now perform this fast with utmost sincerity, burning incense and lighting lamps, contemplating the true and reciting scriptures, to absolve past transgressions—thousands of faults and myriad errors. I beseech the Supreme Great Void, the Cavernous Purple Vacuity, the Primordial Lord of the North; the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens; the Lofty Jade Dawn; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Perfected Lord; the Divine King of the Great Perfection; the Northern Marquis of Central Perfection; the Myriad Immortals of the Lofty Mystic; and the Supreme Sage Heavenly Worthy. Grant your compassionate illumination and special pardon, that I may study the Dao and attain it, seek immortality and achieve it, fly through the Great Void, and soar through the Nine Heavens. Deliver my seven generations of ancestors, that they may ascend to the Southern Palace, dwell eternally in non-action, and receive sustenance naturally, bestowed with the grace of the Supreme Sages’ deliverance.

Next, face east and bow twice, then kneel and pray:
I now perform this fast with utmost sincerity, burning incense and lighting lamps, contemplating the true and reciting scriptures, to absolve past transgressions—thousands of faults and myriad errors. I beseech the Lofty Supreme Ninefold Mystic Jade Void Great Emperor of the East; the Supreme Clarity, Primordial Origin, Upper Three Heavens, Boundless Great Dao, Most High Lord Lao; the Lords and Perfected Ones; the Divine King of Yang Valley; the Great Emperor of Fusang; the Heavenly Emperor; the Emperor of the Grand Tenuity; the Central Yellow Lord; the Nine Elder Immortal Lords of the Grotto; the Nine Qi Perfected Lord; the Jade Steps of Supreme Clarity; the Upper Clarity, Supreme Perfected Jade Guardian King and Prime Minister; the Azure Lad of the Jade Gate of the Eastern Sea; the Little Lad of Green Florescence; and the Myriad Sages and Supreme Immortals of the Highest Heavenly Worthy. Grant your compassionate illumination and special pardon, that I may study the Dao and attain it, seek immortality and achieve it, fly through the Great Void, and soar through the Nine Heavens. Deliver my seven generations of ancestors, that they may ascend to the Southern Palace, dwell eternally in the realm of qi, and receive sustenance naturally, bestowed with the grace of the Supreme Sages’ deliverance.

Next, face south and bow twice, then kneel and pray:
I now perform this fast with utmost sincerity, burning incense and lighting lamps, contemplating the true and reciting scriptures, to absolve past transgressions—thousands of faults and myriad errors. I beseech the Supreme Great Void of the South, the Ninefold Mystic Primordial Cavernous Numinous Jade Emperor; the Supreme Prime of the Southern Culmen; the Lord of Life of the Southern Prosperity; the Lofty Sage of Cavernous Yang; and the Supreme Immortal Heavenly Worthy. Grant your compassionate illumination and special pardon, that I may study the Dao and attain it, seek immortality and achieve it, fly through the Great Void, and soar through the Nine Heavens. Deliver my seven generations of ancestors, that they may ascend to the Southern Palace, dwell eternally in non-action, and receive sustenance naturally, bestowed with the grace of the Supreme Sages’ deliverance.

Next, face the central direction above the Grand Year Star and bow twice, then kneel and pray:
I now perform this fast with utmost sincerity, burning incense and lighting lamps, contemplating the true and reciting scriptures, to absolve past transgressions—thousands of faults and myriad errors. I beseech the Supreme, Unsurpassed, Boundless, Inexhaustible, Great Vacuous Cavernous Primordial Ancient Master, the Father and Mother of Myriad Dao; the Purple Vacuity Azure Essence Emperor; the Later Sage, Ninefold Mystic Golden Portal Emperor; the Four Perfected Ones of the Central Yellow Jade Numinosity; the Central August Supreme Immortal; and the Heavenly Worthy. Grant your compassionate illumination and special pardon, that I may study the Dao and attain it, seek immortality and achieve it, fly through the Great Void, and soar through the Nine Heavens. Deliver my seven generations of ancestors, that they may ascend to the Southern Palace, dwell eternally in non-action, and receive sustenance naturally, bestowed with the grace of the Supreme Sages’ deliverance.

After paying homage to the Five Emperors, return to face the east and recite the "Songs of Sorrow and Joy of the Five Emperors," circumambulating three times, concluding at the south and halting to the north. Simply recite the scriptures without further prostrations. Upon completing the circumambulation, face north and recite the "Three Eulogies of the Four Poles and Five Sufferings." Conclude with three bows, nine prostrations, and nine strikes to the cheeks to repent for sins across the Four Poles.

After repenting for the Four Poles, return to face the east, strike the teeth three times, and pinch incense three times. Pray:
May the Five Marchmounts and Five Emperors, the divine immortal envoys, the true and upright of the Two Qi, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, Flying Immortals, and the incense officials of the Five Marchmounts summon the true qi of the ten directions, the natural golden liquid elixir, the essence of mushrooms, and the Ninefold Mystic Jade Perfected Ones to gather in this fasting hall. Illuminate my body within, that I may study the Dao and attain it, seek immortality and achieve it, fly through the Great Void, and soar through the Nine Heavens. May jade lads and jade maidens attend the incense smoke, conveying my prayers to the presence of the Most High, Boundless, Supreme Great Dao, the Jade Emperor’s throne.

Strike the teeth nine times, swallow qi nine times, then cease. Exit the chamber without looking back.

The *Central Prime Scripture* states: When performing the Central Prime fast, inscribe the talismanic banners of the Five Emperors’ life-demons and place them in the five directions. This is because those who cultivate the Dao are tested by the Great Demon King, who disrupts concentration and prevents the descent of the true. Thus, the life-demons are commanded to restrain them. Upon completion, store the banners in a brocade pouch.

Perform morning and evening rites at the three periods, with meals and rest following the same method as the Upper Prime fast. Upon completion of the fast, all fast officers shall be reassigned, also in accordance with the Upper Prime’s protocol, with the sole addition of expressing gratitude at the outset for resolving past transgressions and absolving faults.

The *Three Primes Scripture* states: For the Upper Prime fast, light lamps to a maximum of ninety, with a middle grade of sixty, and a lower grade of thirty, arranging them to the left and right of the fast hall, at the gates, and above the positions of the Year-Star, the Monthly Stem-Branch, the day’s Stem-Branch, the natal destiny, and the current year. For the Middle Prime fast, light lamps to a maximum of sixty, with a middle grade of thirty-six, and a lower grade of twelve. For the Lower Prime fast, light lamps to a maximum of thirty-six, with a middle grade of twenty-four, and a lower grade of nine. It is also excellent to follow the lamp-lighting numbers of the Upper Prime in all cases. If resources are lacking, one may also adhere to the Lower Prime’s method.

The *Three Primes Scripture* further states: For the lamps at the Year-Star and the natal destiny, ensure they remain lit day and night, while the other lamps need not be lit during the day. If rain falls, it suffices to light only the lamps at the Year-Star and the natal destiny within the fast hall; the rest may be omitted.

The *Three Primes Scripture* concludes: When the fast’s participants and officers complete the incense offering, each shall bow twice before their respective natal destiny lamp and again before the Year-Star, making their petitions and expressing their wishes as they see fit.

*Supreme Mysteries*, Scroll Fifty-Six—end.
*Supreme Mysteries*, Scroll Fifty-Seven.

**The Supreme Perfected’s Upper Prime Fast**

The *Highest Cavern-True Three Primes Fast* governs the Upper Prime for Heaven, the Lower Prime for Earth, and the Middle Prime for Humanity. When the Three Primes unite with the True, they correspond above to the Nine Mysteries.

For the Upper Prime’s nine-day fast, one circumambulates while reciting scriptures, contemplates the True, and invokes the spirits to harmonize the elixir and secure life, thereby ascending to seek transcendence. For the Middle Prime’s six-day fast, one petitions for absolution of past transgressions, violations of precepts, and karmic entanglements. For the Lower Prime’s three-day fast, one delivers the seven ancestors and releases the Nine Yin, guiding the dead to rebirth in Heaven. This is the sublime method of the Highest, the root of transcendence. Those who cultivate it and attain the True must not lightly disclose or profane it, lest they incur the punishment of the Three Officials.

Those who wish to practice the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern-True Scripture*, the *Feminine One’s Jade Tallies of the Five Venerables Treasure Scripture*, the Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother, the Twelve Supreme Vows, or chant the soaring and mysterious jade texts of the Highest—contemplating the True, performing the Dao, ascending to seek transcendence, or compounding the divine elixir—may proceed as they wish.

For the Upper Prime fast, one observes a nine-day pure fast. One day prior, bathe with the Five Fragrances, maintain a vigil of fasting and unifying the mind. The number of participants may range from nine down to three. Upon entering the chamber, face north, click the teeth thirty-six times, and offer incense three times. Kneeling, invoke:

*"To the Supreme Perfected August Elders of the Upper Prime, the Five Thearchs’ Numinous Officers of the Highest Transcendent Metropolis: Your servants, on such-and-such a day of this month, shall light lamps, burn incense, circumambulate while reciting scriptures, or compound the divine elixir as we see fit. We humbly request the presence of thirty-six Monitoring Perfected Envoys, Direct-Fast Transcendent Officers, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens to oversee our cultivation of the True, that our deeds may ascend to the Celestial Throne of the Highest Jade Thearch of the Nine Heavens. Tomorrow, as we commence the fast and serve the Supreme Perfected, may our nocturnal petitions be heard and accepted."*

Upon concluding, at dawn the next day, enter the chamber with a fasting mind. First, outside the fast hall’s door, the fast’s host clicks the teeth three times, envisioning the chamber filled with a cloud of spontaneous purple *qi*. Jade Lads and Jade Maidens array themselves to the left and right. Whisper:

*"As your servant now enters the chamber to burn incense and perform the Dao, may the Direct-Fast Transcendent Officers oversee and protect us, and may the Supreme Perfected convey our deeds to the Mysterious Void, reporting all movements."*

Then enter the chamber, turn left, and face east toward the incense burner, praying:

*"To the Primordial Numinous Five Venerable Perfected, Golden Transcendents and Jade Lads, Pure Numinous Jade Maidens, attendants to the left and right of the incense, and Flying Transcendent Numinous Officers—we invoke the Primordial Thearch of the Nine Heavens, the Jade Thearch of the Void and August. As your servants now burn incense and recite scriptures, may the boundless upright *qi* descend into our bodies, receiving the secret words from our mouths, that our petitions swiftly ascend to the Celestial Throne of the Highest Jade Void."*

Next, turn left, face north, kneel, and click the teeth thirty-six times, praying:

*"We reverently summon the Perfected Numinous Officers within the four limbs, five constituents, three [palaces], and nineteen portals of our bodies—Flying Transcendents to the left and right, Jade Void Attendants, the Five Thearchs of the Five Colored Primordial August Perfected, Flying Dragon Merit Clerks, and Transcendent Envoys, thirty-six each—to emerge. The Jade Void Attendants and Flying Transcendents bear nine-hued, sky-radiant feathered standards; the Five Thearchs of the Five Colored Primordial August Perfected wield the Five Thearchs’ Mandate-Demon Numinous Banners; the Flying Dragon Merit Clerks wear feathered robes adorned with golden true phoenix insignia; the Transcendent Envoys, arrayed in the Seven Primes’ Interlocking Net, hold jade tablets and stand before us. They receive the secret words from our mouths, ascend upon golden-rooted, purple-canopied, cinnabar-axled, jade-carriaged flying-cloud chariots, accompanied by twelve Golden Transcendents and Jade Lads, twelve Supreme Flower Jade Maidens, and twenty-four myriad hosts of left and right dragon-tiger sky-soaring feathered riders. Together, they traverse the Purple Void, ascending to the towering jasper chambers, golden-splendored jade halls within the Purple Orchid of the Nine Heavens. They ascend to the boundless and infinite Highest Cavern-True, the Nine Mysteries’ Primordial Father, the Mysterious Void’s Primordial Mother, the Primordial Thearch, the Highest Jade Void’s Thirty-Nine Chapters, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the August Jade Dawn, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Four Administrations and Five Thearchs, the Boundless Heavenly Worthy, and the *qi*-linked Spontaneous Mysterious Metropolis’ Primordial August Great Cavern’s Three Luminaries’ disciples, the humble Perfected of Lesser Portent, your servants so-and-so, by virtue of karmic fortune, have turned the Wheel of Dharma to be born in the human realm, humbly serving the Highest Mystery. Inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ Dragon Script and the Supreme Clarity’s Treasure Texts, we covet the Dao and delight in the True, aspiring to transcendence. Today, we enter the chamber, commence the fast, recite scriptures, contemplate the True, perform the Dao, burn incense, light lamps, or compound the divine elixir as we see fit. We reverently lead one another, uniting our minds to pay homage to the Jade Heaven’s Supreme Clarity Highest, the Three Treasures’ Commanding Transcendent Attendants, the Five Directions’ Five Thearchs’ Monitoring Numinous Gentlemen, Direct-Fast Envoys, Flying Transcendents, Earthbound Transcendents, the Five Marchmounts’ Numinous Transcendents, and the nine hundred million myriad hosts of cavalry and chariots. May they descend as one to encamp around our bodies, dispelling demons, dissolving trials, averting misfortune, and warding off calamities. May they summon the spontaneous upright *qi*, the golden liquid’s elixir essence, and the numinous mushrooms, that transcendents may gather in the fast hall, illuminating our bodies. May Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attend the incense smoke, that our practice of the Dao may succeed, our quest for transcendence be fulfilled, and we soar through the Great Void, ascending to the Nine Heavens, aligning with our heart’s desires and unifying the Three Treasures as the True. Upon completing the practice, may our petitions return to their original abodes, and may our offerings be received and acknowledged."*

Then return to face east, turn toward the incense burner, offer incense three times, and declare:

*"Disciple of the Great Cavern’s Three Luminaries, humble Perfected of Lesser Portent, Master of the Such-and-Such Marchmount, your servant so-and-so, now establishes the fast, appoints the direct officers, lights lamps, recites scriptures, contemplates the spirits, invokes the True, performs the Dao to seek transcendence, and ascends to the Nine Heavens—or compounds the divine elixir as we see fit. May this merit absolve our transgressions, dissolve our sins, sever the roots of death, and summon the Nine Heavens’ spontaneous, upright, and perfected to inscribe our names on the Thearch’s register, recording us in the Supreme Clarity’s flying script. May we traverse the Mysterious Void, attain the Perfected’s rank, and return our spirits to the Primordial Jade Thearch of the Nine Mysteries’ Highest, the Thirty-Nine Thearchs, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the Highest Jade Dawn, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, the myriad transcendents and sagely hosts, and the Boundless Heavenly Worthy. May this merit flow back to refine and deliver our bodies, transforming us to traverse the empty and void, soaring to the Jade Clarity’s Golden Gates."*

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Highest and Most Ultimate Heavenly Worthy, that after attaining the Dao we may ascend into the formless and share the wheel of the Three Treasures.

**Second Offering of Incense.**
May we, so-and-so and company, now in reverent fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens—or compounding the divine elixir as we see fit—dedicate this merit to the boundless and infinite realms of the four frontiers, the hidden learners in the renowned mountains, the dharma masters who have already attained the Dao, our parents and honored kin, and our fellow disciples and worthy Daoist companions. May each attain the Dao and ascend to the Supreme Clarity. We take refuge in the Great Perfected, the Upper Prime’s Nine Mysteries’ hosts of myriad transcendents, and the Jade Thearch Heavenly Worthy. May this merit of universal deliverance enable all to swiftly attain ascension and soar to the Supreme Clarity.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Void and Supreme Perfected, the Upper Prime’s Highest and Sagely Most True Heavenly Worthy, that after attaining the Dao we may ascend into the formless and share the wheel of the Three Treasures.

**Third Offering of Incense.**
We pray:
May we, so-and-so and company, now in reverent fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens—or compounding the divine elixir as we see fit—dedicate this merit to our household, the nine clans of kin and marriage, all under heaven and upon earth, the lord of the realm and his sovereign, ministers, officials, and common folk, and all living beings—winged, creeping, crawling, or breathing—whether already born or yet to be born. We surrender body, spirit, and life to the Nine Heavens’ Highest host of Perfected and the Jade Void Heavenly Worthy. May this merit of universal deliverance enable all to escape the Ten Sufferings, Eight Difficulties, Five Calamities, Six Harms, Nine Tribulations, and Seven Injuries, each preserving their fortune and emolument, dwelling long in spontaneity.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and take refuge in the Highest and Boundless Heavenly Perfected, that after attaining the Dao we may ascend into the formless and share the wheel of the Three Treasures.

Turning to the northwest, we bow twice, facing the upper realm, and kneeling in prayer say:
We now burn incense in fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens. May the Great Perfected, the Primordial Heavenly King of the Upper Prime, the Primordial Father of the Nine Mysteries, the Highest Jade Thearch, the Myriad Sagely Thearchs, and the Most Ultimate Cavernous Prime and Grand Void Heavenly Worthy deign to bestow the qi of the Highest Dawn’s Jade Perfected, bending its light to illumine our bodies. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; soaring through the Mysterious Void and ascending into the Grand Empyrean, attend and guard the Sagely Lords, and ascend to the Golden Gates of the Jade Clarity’s palace.

Next, turning to the southeast, we bow twice, facing the lower realm, and kneeling in prayer say:
We now burn incense in fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens. May the Great Perfected, the Primordial Heavenly King of the Upper Prime, the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Mysteries, the Primordial Venerable Master, the Purple Void’s Myriad Sagely Thearchs of the Highest August, and the Most Ultimate Cavernous Prime and Grand Void Heavenly Worthy deign to bestow the qi of the Luminous Dawn, bending its light to illumine our bodies. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; soaring through the Mysterious Void and ascending into the Grand Empyrean, attend and guard the Sagely Lords, and ascend to the Golden Gates of the Jade Clarity’s palace.

Next, facing north, we bow twice, and kneeling in prayer say:
We now burn incense in fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens. May the Most High Grand Void’s Cavernous Purple Void Primordial Venerable, the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads, the Highest Jade Dawn, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Great Perfected Venerable, the Great Perfected Jade Thearch, the Northern Marquis of Central Perfection, and the Highest Mysterious Myriad Transcendent Sagely Heavenly Worthies deign to bestow the qi of the Luminous Dawn, bending its light to illumine our bodies. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; soaring through the Mysterious Void and ascending into the Grand Empyrean, attend and guard the Sagely Lords, and ascend to the Golden Gates of the Jade Clarity’s palace.

Next, facing west, we bow twice, and kneeling in prayer say:
We now burn incense in fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens. May the Most High Primordial Void’s Cavernous Grand Prime’s Nine Mysteries’ Primordial Essence Jade Perfected Venerable, the Highest Sagely Transcendent of the Tortoise Terrace Jade Consort, and the Jade Void Grand Void Heavenly Worthy deign to bestow the qi of the Luminous Dawn, bending its light to illumine our bodies. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; soaring through the Mysterious Void and ascending into the Grand Empyrean, attend and guard the Sagely Lords, and ascend to the Golden Gates of the Jade Clarity’s palace.

Next, facing east, we bow twice, and kneeling in prayer say:
We now burn incense in fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens. May the Highest Nine Mysteries’ Jade Void Thearch-Emperor, the Supreme Clarity’s Primordial Upper Three Heavens’ Boundless Great Dao’s Most High Lord Lao, the Venerable Masters, the Divine King of Yang Valley, the Great Thearch of Fusang, the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity, the Central Yellow Venerable, the Nine Elders of the Transcendent Metropolis, the Nine Qi Venerable, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Clarity’s Most High Great Perfected Jade Treasure, the Highest Minister, the Jade Lad of the Eastern Sea’s Jade Gate and Azure Florescence, and the Myriad Sagely and Most Ultimate Heavenly Worthies deign to bestow the qi of the Luminous Dawn, bending its light to illumine our bodies. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; soaring through the Mysterious Void and ascending into the Grand Empyrean, attend and guard the Sagely Lords, and ascend to the Golden Gates of the Jade Clarity’s palace.

Next, facing south, we bow twice, and kneeling in prayer say:
We now burn incense in fast and vigil, illuminating with lamps and reciting scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens. May the Grand Void’s Nine Mysteries’ Primordial Cavernous Numinous Void Jade Thearch-Emperor, the Upper Prime’s Southern Culmen’s Prohibiting Lord, the Southern Prosperity’s Controller of Destiny and Lord of Longevity, and the Cavernous Yang’s Highest Sagely Transcendent Heavenly Worthies deign to bestow the qi of the Luminous Dawn, bending its light to illumine our bodies. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; soaring through the Mysterious Void and ascending into the Grand Empyrean, and ascend to the Golden Gates of the Jade Clarity’s palace.

Next, facing the Central Tai Sui, bow twice again, kneel long, and pray, saying:
We now burn incense in fasting devotion, illumine lamps and recite scriptures, meditate upon the divine and invoke the Perfected, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence and soar through the Nine Heavens. May the Primordial Venerable One of the Supreme Prime’s Apex, the Boundless and Ineffable Grand Void’s Cavernous Mysterious Dark, the Myriad Dao’s Father and Mother, the Purple Void’s Azure Essence Emperor-Lord, the Latter Sagely Nine Mysteries’ Golden Gates Emperor-Lord, the Great Flower’s Jade Numinous Central Mystery’s Four Perfected High Sages, and the Central August Highest Transcendent Heavenly Worthies deign to bestow grace and bend their light, taking pity on our humble origins, that we may, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; soaring through the Mysterious Void and ascending into the Grand Empyrean, and ascend to the Golden Gates of the Jade Clarity’s palace.

This done, return to stand in the West, facing East, knock the teeth nine times, and thrice offer incense, praying, saying:
We burn incense in fasting devotion and recite scriptures, practicing the Dao to seek transcendence. Now, at this felicitous convergence of celestial cycles, we lay forth our myriad prayers. May the Great Flower’s numinous power awaken, golden transcendents waft incense, the Four Controllers oversee and illumine, the Five Thearchs guard our chariots, the host of sages descend in turn, revolving through the Three Wheels, treading the Void in flight, and paying homage to the Jade Heaven. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking the Perfected, attain the Perfected; in seeking the Sagely, attain the Sagely; in seeking the divine, attain the divine; in seeking flight, attain flight; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence. May the Six Prayers and Eight Convergences all deliver our bodies, that we may ride the flying radiance and ascend through the Nine Mysteries.

This done, swallow qi nine times and cease.

The Azure Lad says: At this time, one should rise in the West, circumambulate while offering incense, and recite the *Western Flower’s Pure Numinous Hymn*, circling the incense burner three times. Then, in the South, face North and bow nine times in total before ceasing.

The Azure Lad says: As for the rites of homage, one may simply perform them in the heart. For the Upper Prime’s ranks, at dawn, attire oneself with care. Once incense is burned at the first hour, sit and take congee. After another hour has passed in the heart, burn incense again and take food. Thereafter, recite scriptures, and as one pleases, take meals, rest, and sleep, nurturing the spirit and circulating qi until the midnight hour. Burn incense again at another hour—these three times are all occasions when the Upper Prime’s generative qi arises. Thus, in the assemblies for practicing the Dao and seeking transcendence, the world performs the three prayers of the hour, praying to inquire into the rites of the Nine Mysteries’ return to the Nine Heavens.

After nine days of burning incense are complete, at dawn, enter the chamber and perform the rites of homage as prescribed. Then, facing East, kneel long, knock the teeth nine times, and proclaim:
We, the humble disciples of the Three Radiant Ones of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital, the Lesser Manifestations and True Persons of the Five Peaks, [Name] and others, bow our heads twice and reverently address the Supreme Upper Prime’s True Void of the Nine Mysteries’ Grand Loftiness Jade Thearch, the Thirty-Nine Thearchs, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the High Sagely Jade Dawn, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Four Controllers and Five Thearchs, the Myriad Dao’s Primordial Beginning’s Highest Sagely Most Exalted Heavenly Worthies. We, who delight in the Dao and rejoice in transcendence, aspire to soar through the Nine Mysteries and ascend to the Upper Perfected. On this day of the present month, in the [such-and-such] commandery, county, village, and hamlet, we have begun our fasting devotion, burning incense, reciting scriptures, meditating upon the divine, invoking the Perfected, and practicing the Dao to seek transcendence. Should we compound the divine elixir, we shall follow the dictates of our will. When the cultivation is complete, we humbly address the Upper Clarity’s Three Treasures’ Attendant Transcendent Lords, the Five Directions’ Five Thearchs’ Supervising Numinous Officers, the Masters of Ceremonial Offerings, the Flying Transcendents, Heavenly Transcendents, Earthly Transcendents, the Five Peaks’ and Four Waterways’ Four Directions’ Reclining Inspectors, and the Perfected Transcendents. May the Perfected Palaces advance our ranks and the Transcendent Ones ascend in grade, with titles and stipends conferred according to rank, in accordance with the rites of the Supreme Perfected. May we, in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao; in seeking transcendence, attain transcendence; in compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; in refining gold, transmute gold; dividing our bodies and transforming, descending in the seventy-four directions’ green chariots, soaring through the Upper Clarity, ascending in radiance through the Nine Heavens, the sun and moon shining together, the Three Treasures revolving as one. We humbly beseech the Most Exalted’s oversight and the redoubled grace of the cinnabar heart. Our study of the methods remains incomplete, and our bearing and conduct often fail to accord with the rites. In our comings and goings, we may transgress the statutes and be censured by the Four Controllers or seized by the Five Thearchs. For our thousand transgressions and myriad faults, we beseech pardon and mercy, taking pity on our unenlightened origins. May the True Transcendents of our five bodily components ascend to the Mysterious Capital in accordance with our merits, receive their ranks, and return to our bodies, that we may together ascend and soar through the Grand Empyrean.

On the day of establishing the fast, one should arrange the Nine Heavens’ tokens of gold and jade radiance in the five directions to summon the divine and attract the numinous.

The Perfected Lord said: Those who lodge their essence in the Mysterious and Nest in the Transcendent, though mountains and rivers collapse, do not waver in resolve. Those in whom the Dao abides in truth, though assailed by cold and heat, hunger and thirst, do not abandon their practice—this is the utmost of single-minded devotion.

Some seize upon the wind to exploit an opening; some cling to demons to bind themselves to affliction. Yet if one resolutely casts all aside and does not grasp at them, the Dao of old is not the Dao of today. If spiritual awakening differs by a hundred gaps, what can such things do to me?

Let others hear of this and take heed.

The Perfected Lord said: In his youth, Master Zhuang Bo was fond of the Dao of life. He would always, at the proper hour, face the northwest, close his eyes, clench his fists, and visualize Mount Kunlun. He maintained this practice for twenty-one years. Later, he consumed elixirs and entered the mountains to study the Dao, yet still preserved this method. After another decade or so, he closed his eyes and suddenly beheld Mount Kunlun, visualizing it without cease. Thereupon he encountered an immortal, who transmitted to him the formula for the Golden Liquid. Thus he attained the Dao—all through the power of concentrated devotion to evoke the Dao’s response.

The Lord of Determined Records said: Once there was a man who loved the Dao but did not know the method for seeking it. He did nothing but prostrate himself morning and evening before a withered tree, beseeching: “Grant me long life.” He persisted thus for twenty-eight years without weariness. One day, the withered tree suddenly burst into bloom, and the blossoms exuded a sap sweet as honey. Someone instructed him to consume it, so he ate both the flowers and the sap. Upon finishing, he became an immortal. Such was the utmost of his concentrated devotion—even a withered tree could produce these purple blossoms and sweet nectar. How much more, then, the numinous peaks of the Three Radiant Ones, the Five Mushrooms sown and cultivated? Yet those who dwell in reverent mountain grottoes, purifying themselves of filth and defilement, are truly pitiable.

There was once Master Fu, who from his youth loved the Dao. He entered a stone chamber in Mount Huo and remained there for seven years. The Supreme Venerable Lord came to him and gave him a wooden drill, instructing him to bore through a stone disk five feet thick, saying: “When you have pierced this disk, you will attain the Dao.” The man drilled day and night for forty-seven years, until the stone was fully penetrated. Thereupon he was granted the divine elixir and ascended to the Grand Purity, becoming the Perfected Man of the Southern Marchmount. Such was a man of true resolve.

Take note of this.

Once there was Liu Shaoweng, who repeatedly entered Mount Hua to pay homage and bow toward the mountain, doing so for twenty years. Suddenly one day, he beheld the Venerable Elder of the Western Marchmount, who bestowed upon him the immortal Dao.

There was also a man who, for ten years, went at dawn to the riverbank to bow to the river. The River Earl and the River Spirit then appeared to him, presenting him with ten pairs of white jade disks and teaching him the method of walking upon water without sinking. This man later attained the Dao on the Central Marchmount.

Zuo Ci, when he first arrived, also devoted himself earnestly to bowing in reverence to the numinous mountains. After five years, he deeply penetrated the mysteries of the Cavernous Darkness.

From the *True Reports*:

At that time, in the southern garden near the cinnabar slopes of Mount Huo, within a neighboring chamber, there lived a diligent and worthy man named Wang Fudu, who had a daughter named Aqiu Zeng. When she was sixteen, while bathing in fragrant waters in the bathhouse, she saw a radiant glow curving and illuminating the space, suspecting something extraordinary. She stepped outside, climbed a tree, and faced south, where she beheld the luminous splendor of a perfected divine spirit, his countenance resplendent as the sun. Overjoyed, the girl clasped her hands in reverence and called out her name from afar: "Aqiu Zeng, having now encountered this blessed meeting and beheld the Heavenly Venerable, I dedicate myself to the Heaven within the Ten Directions. I beseech you to grant me the precepts, that I may uphold the scriptural teachings, eradicate all evil roots, swiftly attain rebirth, and transform this female form into a male one. After ten thousand kalpas, I hope to become a flying immortal."

The Five Thearchs and the Demon Kings, seeing the girl’s great vow and resolve, feared she might transcend the demonic realms. Thus, they transformed into five elderly emperors and approached her, saying: "We have received the command of the Venerable Divinities of the Ten Directions to impart to you the scriptures of the Numinous Treasure. Our Dao is now propagating its teachings, with benevolence, compassion, and filial piety as its foundation. We have heard that your father intends to marry you off, having already accepted another’s proposal, and this cannot be refused. You should first comply with his wishes. To defy your father’s instruction would leave no path to attaining immortality."

The girl replied to the demonic words: "In my past life, I was unfortunate, lacking karmic affinity and merit, which led me to be born in this female form. I regret this day and night, vowing to maintain a single heart, my resolve firm and natural. Though my life comes from my parents, my destiny lies with the Heaven of the Ten Directions. To truly defy my father’s teaching would be unlike your counsel."

Seeing the girl’s steadfast heart and upright bearing, the demons could not sway her and thus retreated.

Aqiu Zeng then declared: "The Dao is lofty and remote, and I have no means to fully realize it. I shall gather firewood, ascend the wall, and burn my body, hoping that my form may dissolve into the Heaven within the Ten Directions, that I may attain timely liberation and scatter like dust." She then cast herself into the fire, and in an instant, her body vanished without trace, as if flung into the void. In that brief moment, her female form transformed into that of a man, who proceeded directly before the Dao.

From the *Scripture of the Cavernous Darkness and Jade Instructions*

**The Chapter on Softness and Weakness**

Laozi said: In all under heaven, nothing is softer or weaker than *qi*. Of the softness and weakness of *qi*, nothing surpasses the Dao. The reason the Dao is soft and weak is that it embraces the past and present heavens and earth, penetrating all things. For softness gives rise to hardness, and weakness gives rise to strength—yet none in the world know from whence their root arises!

Thus, being arises from non-being as its mother; non-being arises from emptiness as its mother; emptiness arises from the Dao as its mother. That which is natural is the root of the Dao.

*From the* Scripture of Western Ascent

Water, as a thing, is soft and weak, yet all-pervading. Serene, tranquil, and harmonious, its mind holds nothing; its virtue aligns with heaven and earth, its blessings extend to the ten thousand things. Vast, it encompasses all; minute, it enters all. Neither metal nor stone can obstruct it, nor can ruined mountains and mounds dam its flow. It shuns the solid and returns to the void, turns from heights to seek the low. Vast and boundless, it flows without end, breaking through barriers and drifting stones—swifter than the wind. Limitless and without bounds, it follows the long and distant Dao, beginning without form and ending in rivers and seas. Rising, it becomes clouds; descending, it becomes rain. Flowing above and below, it bestows without cease, vanishing only to return, dying only to live again.

Thus, the sage abandons ear and eye, returning the mind to water. Embodying softness, they guard the feminine; forsaking the high, they descend to the low; forsaking beauty, they embrace the ugly. They endure disgrace like the earth, contain filth like the sea. Serene and indifferent, without intent, they drift as if without end. Ever-changing and without constancy, they alone endure with heaven and earth from beginning to end.

*From the* Scripture of Wondrous Perfection

Know the masculine, yet guard the feminine, and become the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley, constant virtue never departs, returning to the state of infancy.

Know the bright, yet guard the dark, and become the world’s model.
As the world’s model, constant virtue never falters, returning to the boundless.

Know glory, yet guard disgrace, and become the world’s valley.
As the world’s valley, constant virtue is fulfilled, returning to the uncarved block.
When the uncarved block is scattered, it becomes vessels; when the sage employs it, it becomes a leader of officials. Thus, the great system is not divided.

*From the* Dao Scripture *of Laozi*

The softest thing in the world gallops through the hardest. Without substance, it enters where there is no gap. Thus do I know the benefit of non-action. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain them.

Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao. The things of heaven and earth are born of being; being is born of non-being.

In all under heaven, nothing is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing conquers the hard and strong as it does—nothing can replace it. Thus, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong. None in the world do not know this, yet none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says: He who bears the world’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain; he who bears the world’s misfortune is called the king of all under heaven. True words seem contradictory.

When people are born, they are soft and weak; when they die, they are hard and stiff. When the ten thousand things and grasses and trees are born, they are soft and fragile; when they die, they are withered and dry. Thus, the hard and strong are followers of death; the soft and weak are followers of life. Therefore, when an army is strong, it will not prevail; when a tree is strong, it will be felled. The strong and great dwell below; the soft and weak dwell above.

*From the* Virtue Scripture *of Laozi*

**The Chapter on Emptiness and Tranquility**

Attain utmost emptiness, guard perfect stillness—then the ten thousand things arise together. I observe their return. Though things flourish in abundance, each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to life. Returning to life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy, one acts recklessly and invites misfortune. Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing; being all-embracing, one is impartial; being impartial, one is kingly; being kingly, one is heavenly; being heavenly, one is of the Dao; being of the Dao, one endures. Even in death, one is not imperiled.

*From the* Dao Scripture *of Laozi*

Laozi said: First, abandon form and forget the body, drifting as if nothing—this is called emptiness. Second, diminish the mind and discard intent, casting off falsity and forsaking desire—this is called nothingness. Third, concentrate the essence and accumulate spirit, not mingling with things—this is called purity. Fourth, return the spirit and serve *qi*, calm and unmoving—this is called stillness. Fifth, dwell in seclusion, keeping merit and fame concealed—this is called subtlety. Sixth, leave wife and children, wandering alone with the Dao—this is called solitude. Seventh, breathe in harmony, smooth and fine—this is called softness. Eighth, relax the body and extend the limbs, attending to all affairs—this is called weakness. Ninth, detest honor and glory, content with poverty and delighting in disgrace—this is called humility. Tenth, flee from fullness and escape excess, wearing coarse clothes and eating simple food—this is called reduction. Eleventh, act in accord with yang, responding to change and repelling evil—this is called timeliness. Twelfth, neither hungry nor cold, neither joyful nor angry, neither sorrowful nor delighted, neither slow nor hasty—this is called harmony. Thirteenth, cherish seeing, cherish speaking, cherish hearing, cherish thinking, firm and unspent, with spirit and clarity inwardly guarded—this is called frugality.

These thirteen merge into one emptiness and nothingness, forming the great essential. Self-exhausting and self-extreme, the Dao of non-action is complete. If one thing is not mastered, only emptiness is good.

When accomplishment is embodied, the spirit naturally rests. Harmonious *qi* flows, entering the sinews and bones. *Qi* refines and transforms the form, uniting with the portents. Light and soaring, one roams afar, and at life’s end, one’s destiny is fulfilled in heaven. This is not only for governing the self but for bringing peace to the myriad states.

*From the* Scripture of Emptiness and Nothingness

**The Chapter on Mountain Dwelling**

The Most High said: Dwelling in the mountains entails ten precepts:
First, one must not lead households to transform the people.
Second, one must not associate with the noble and eminent to seek fame and profit.

**Third,** one must not again practice heterodox incantations, prohibitions, or arts.

**Fourth,** one must not sell medicines or practice medicine to take others’ money or goods.

**Fifth,** one should maintain separation from others; one must not share bed or seat with worldly men, women, or those who preside over libation rites with yellow and red offerings.

**Sixth,** at dawn, noon, sunset, the hour of human rest, midnight, and cockcrow, one should pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, repent transgressions, and eradicate evil.

**Seventh,** after midday, one must not consume grains or *qi*-laden foods; anything containing grain-*qi* must not be brought near the mouth. Water jade, *zhi* stones, pine wood, Solomon’s seal, cloud essence, *lingfei* powder, wolfberry, and the like are always forbidden.

**Eighth,** when traversing the mountains to gather herbs, one should snap the fingers once every three steps and utter a chant every ten steps. With every step taken or set down, one must constantly meditate on the Dao, imagining divine beings upon the cliffs or by the path bestowing upon one the arts of immortality.

**Ninth,** if one has attained but a small measure of the Dao and has yet to achieve mastery, one must not display it ostentatiously or treat others with arrogance or disdain.

**Tenth,** one should remember the kindness of one’s parents in giving and sustaining life, never forgetting their grace.

These are the ten precepts for dwelling in the mountains, the essentials of cultivating the Dao.

*From the* Scripture of Ascending Mystery

---

For all who study the scriptures of the Six Heavens and the orthodox methods of the Three Heavens, who wander the Five Peaks and traverse rivers and marshes, one must perform the invocations of the Three Heavens’ Orthodox Unity, the rites for dispelling misfortune and trials, and the arts for summoning spirits and attaining immortality.

At the outset of ascending a mountain, one should first strike the teeth nine times outside the mountain, close the eyes, and visualize five-colored clouds surging forth to envelop the entire mountain and oneself within their *qi*. After a long while, one will see the immortals of the Five Peaks, the mountain’s forms, forests, grasses, marshes, birds, beasts, and the myriad things all coming to pay homage. Then, one should raise one’s voice in invocation:

The Supreme Emperor sets forth,
Auspicious day, propitious hour.
Jade radiance covers me,
The Great One attends as escort.
To my left, White Prime assists;
To my right, Primordial Splendor aids.
The Eight Emperors and Nine Perfected,
I meet with fortune and thrive.
The Dao guides me, the Dao sends me,
Sharing its light with me.
Treading the Five Peaks,
Immortals welcome me in throngs.
Entering rivers and seas,
Myriad paths open wide.
Commanding the Six Dings,
Revolving and seizing the Five Phases.
The Three Heavens issue decree,
Sweeping away all misfortune.
Severing and sweeping away filth,
Molten metal dispels calamity.
The orthodox method flows clearly,
Stern as frost in its might.
Luminous essence shimmers,
Dragon chariots rise proud.
Verdant plumes stream,
Flying brocade robes flutter.
Wherever I go,
All is auspicious and flourishing.
The myriad perfected come to pay homage,
Together ascending Jade Capital.

Having finished, draw in *qi* thirty-six times and swallow.

*From the* Orthodox Scripture of the Three Heavens’ True Methods *of the Cavern Realms*

---

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: If a Daoist wishes to dwell in secluded mountain places, one should first receive the scriptural teachings, serve one’s master with reverence, and cultivate all meritorious deeds to subdue the mountain spirits. Mountains, great or small, all possess divine spirits. If a mountain is great, its spirit is great; if a mountain is small, its spirit is small. If the mountain spirit harms a person, that person will not stand firm. If one does not comprehend the supreme method and does not know how to cultivate goodness and establish merit, how can one dwell in the mountains?

*From the* Scripture of Questions to the Cavern Mystery *(Lower Scroll)*

---

In ancient times: Those who study the supreme methods, contemplate the divine, meditate on the Dao, dwell in the mountains with tranquil resolve, perform purification rites, recite scriptures, liberate the seven generations of ancestors, and seek immortality for themselves must practice the supreme methods of the Five Elders’ Red Writ of the True Script. Following the established texts, one should first strike the teeth twelve times and invoke:

Supreme and lofty numina,
Primordial and honored spirits.
Great sages linger,
Myriad perfected descend to the hall.
Three luminaries spread their radiance,
Auspicious clouds array on all sides.
The most auspicious charts are examined,
The reckonings of the Nine Heavens are calculated.
Today I make my vow,
Presenting my petition to the numinous mountain.
Cinnabar script in red characters,
The natural true writ.
I report above to the Five Emperors,
Recording my name in the Jade Register.
The myriad spirits bear witness,
Sun and moon clearly proclaim my words.
I vow to attain the Dao, I vow to become an immortal.
Heaven and earth, stars and constellations,
Mysteriously illuminate my body.
The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,
The great spirits of the Five Peaks,
I universally proclaim without end,
Eradicating the roots of my transgressions.
The Primordial Beginning opens wide,
None do not receive my words.
The hidden souls of my seven ancestors
Receive blessings naturally.
The three paths and five sufferings,
Forever depart from the eight difficulties.
May I share the radiance of the Three Luminaries with the purple dawn,
Turn the wheel without ceasing,
And attain the flying immortality of the body.

Having finished the petition, cast it into the abyss, then scatter incense upon the numinous mountain. Again, strike the teeth three times and face the direction of your life’s origin, invoking:

The Primordial Beginning bears witness,
My immortal name is already inscribed.
The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,
No transgressions remain unabsolved.
Scatter incense to the Five Emperors,
Pledge alliance with the Great Void.
All that has been stated,
Shall endure for ten thousand kalpas.

Having finished, raise the head and swallow *qi* nine times.

*From the* Jade Instructions of the Red Writ of the Cavern Mystery

---

Master Lü’s oral instructions: On the day of entering the mountains, before reaching a hundred paces, first step backward seven steps, then turn and ascend the mountain. Mountain spirits will not offend one, all demons will submit and flee, and the hundred poisons will hide away.

*From the* Declarations of the Perfected

---

The Perfected of the Great Origin said: If one can remain aloof from the present age, then what one values is only oneself. Those who guard against external difficulties will have no deadly terrain. Thus, the scholars of old concealed the jade tally in the mountains, hid the luminous mirror amidst the swirling mists, composed their spirits in the courts of mountain crags, and nurtured their true nature by the banks of secluded valleys. Thereupon, they let their hair loose upon the high peaks, weaving the warp and weft of their lives, absorbing the five numina in radiant splendor. They roamed the nine paths, ascended the formless, cast their thoughts into the void, abandoned worldly affairs, preserved the three *qi*, and refined the wondrous essences. Thus, they could reverse the years of the sun’s decline, return to infancy, and enter the Dao. Entering the Dao, one attains immortality; attaining the Dao, one becomes a perfected being.

*From the* Scripture of True Traces

**The Chapter on Departing from the Worldly**

Laozi said: Beyond heaven and earth, there is heaven and earth; beyond the self, there is preservation of life and destiny. Thus, the noble person excels in what others do not excel in, prolongs life where others do not, delights in what others do not delight in, does what others do not do, believes what others do not believe, and walks paths others do not walk. Thus, the Dao and its virtue are complete.

Laozi said: What the scriptures and precepts declare, what dharma and principle expound—however resplendent and flourishing—is not as good as the subtle and minute. Truly, to know the void is better than to know the full; abundance is not as good as scarcity. The swift results of the crooked are not as good as the slow. What rises must fall; what flourishes must decline. The sage cuts off knowledge and acts as though not acting, speaks as though not speaking, and conducts affairs as though not conducting them. Who can understand this? The even is not as good as the odd; the many are not as good as the few. Who is wise is difficult to follow; who is benevolent is difficult to emulate. With few dependencies, one may know what is beyond knowing—the pivot of the Dao. Emptiness, annihilation, and nothingness—what need is there for immortal flight? The Great Dao is vast and boundless, unrestrained by any enclosure. If one can illuminate this, what was once deemed right becomes wrong. The scriptures speak with careful truth—who can pursue it?

*From the* Scripture of Western Ascent

The multitude bustle and rejoice, as though feasting on grand sacrifices, as though ascending springtime terraces. I alone am tranquil, showing no sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. Adrift, as though with no place to return. The multitude all have more than enough, while I alone seem bereft. Ah, my heart is that of a fool! So dull! The common folk are bright and clear, while I alone seem dim. The common folk are sharp and discerning, while I alone am muddled. Vast and boundless, as though without end. The multitude all have their uses, while I alone am stubborn and coarse. I alone differ from others, cherishing the nourishment of the Mother.

*From the* Daoist Scripture of Laozi

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: The learning of the utmost person in cultivating the Dao consists in taking what others cannot take, enduring what others cannot endure, severing what others cannot sever, studying what others cannot study, dwelling where others cannot dwell, achieving success without seeking fame, and aiding beings without limit. Departing and returning, they guard their root, discard the ornamental and embrace the uncarved, hold fast to their resolve with single-mindedness—this may be called the practice of the Great Dao.

*From the* Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Naturalness

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate said: Endure what others cannot endure, sever what others cannot sever, practice what others cannot practice, dwell where others cannot dwell, wear what others cannot wear, eat what others cannot eat, guard what others cannot guard, and study what others cannot study. Then, stabilize with numinous medicines, feast upon cloud-teeth, and the corpse-worms will sink and fall, foul impurities will vanish and dissolve, the Three Palaces will be harmonized and smooth, and the Five Viscera will be at peace and ease. Engage in prolonged fasting and deep contemplation, silently chant the cavernous scriptures, delight in the wondrous flavors, and supplement with the elixir-fluid. How could one not attain the Dao of ascending as an immortal?

*From the* Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery’s Peaceful Aspiration

All people possess eyes, ears, nose, mouth, heart, and intent, yet their conduct differs. Only the foolish fix their gaze on profit and beauty, their ears crave sounds and music, their thoughts are impure, their minds are unclear, and their hands carry out deeds. Evil accumulates over time, and sins bind the celestial spirit. Only the worthy differ entirely from the common folk: their eyes do not wander excessively, and they are not startled by what they see; their ears do not trust slander, nor do they listen to chaotic sounds; their noses do not sniff fragrant and foul scents; their mouths do not taste sweetness, nor do they consume living beings; their hearts do not desire wealth, beauty, or fleeting glory; their hands do no wrong, and their feet take no evil paths—this is the conduct of the Daoist.

*From the* Scripture of Ascending Mystery

*Thus concludes* Volume Sixty-Five of the *Supreme Secret Essentials*

**Volume Sixty-Six of the Supreme Secret Essentials: The Chapter on Ritual Bathing**

The Heavenly Worthy said: For those who pursue the study [of the Dao], on the three most auspicious days of the Three Primes, refine the self with fragrant water, bathe the Five Spirits, and thus qi becomes clear and form upright, spirit bright and true essence conjoined. The body does not receive filth, qi does not receive dust; the Three Passes are pure and void, and the myriad evils do not encroach. The Three Fields and Eight Luminaries shine resplendently within the body. Through ingestion, adornment, and guiding-and-pulling, the Five Palaces are suffused with warmth, filling inner and outer, and one naturally becomes an immortal.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Always on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, at the three times of dawn, noon, and midnight, bathe the bodily form and wash the self with the Five Fragrances. When about to bathe, face south and, with a golden ladle, pour fennel-scented water thirty-two times in a leftward circle toward the southeast. Open the eyes and visualize the sunlight above the left eye, moonlight above the right eye, the Five Stars’ tassels adorning the head, and five-colored clouds swirling around the body. Green Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, lion, and white crane array themselves to left and right. Immortal youths hold towels, jade maidens scatter blossoms, flying immortals ride mounts, and divine guardians protect the body. Then knock the teeth thirty-two times and recite the prayer:

*"Heaven’s qi is clear, the Five Colors radiant on high.*
*Sun and moon pour forth their splendor, bathing my form.*
*Divine fluids within, fragrant water refines my essence.*
*Light and brilliance shine through, illuminating the Upper Clarity.*
*Qi does not receive dust; the Five Palaces admit the numinous.*
*Sins vanish from the Three Paths; misfortunes disperse in the Nine Darknesses.*
*Evil roots are severed; blessings arise of themselves.*
*Today I make this great vow, pledging all before the covenant.*
*My body receives liberation and ascends to the Imperial Court."*

When finished, swallow saliva thirty-two times and cease. After bathing, don cap and robes, knock the teeth thirteen times, and recite the incantation:

*"The Five Turbidities are now pure; the Eight Luminaries are now bright.*
*Today I undergo refinement: sins perish and blessings arise.*
*Ever shall I join the Five Thearchs, equal in truth to the Upper Spirits."*

Then enter the chamber and practice the Dao according to the method.

*From the* Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts of the Cavernous Mystery

The Azure Lad and Lord said: Those who establish resolve in inner cultivation and nurture the spirit to seek immortality must bathe frequently to summon the numinous qi, so that jade maidens descend. Those who do not bathe leave the Three Palaces defiled and polluted.

*From the* Transmission of the Lady of Southern Marchmount

The Lady of Purple Tenuity said: The *Scripture of the Nine Transformations and Ten Transmutations for Renewal* of the Most High states: If one treads upon filth or any unclean place, one should first bathe and wash the body to remove it. The method uses ten ounces of bamboo leaves and four ounces of peeled white peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water in a cauldron, not allowing it to boil over. Bathe the body with the water at a suitable temperature, and all impurities will vanish. This not only removes filth but also wards off damp impediment, sores, and itching. Moreover, bamboo is green outside and white within, and peach repels evil and breaks filth—thus these two substances are used to purge the body’s turbidity. When celestial beings descend to the mortal realm and return, they never fail to use this water to cleanse themselves. Even the common talismanic waters and incantations for rinsing and external application in the world cannot compare to this method. Bathing in it is entirely beneficial.

The Lady of Southern Marchmount said: One cannot bathe too often; the fault lies in people’s inability to do so. Frequent bathing washes away the stench of the corpse and invites the true qi to enter.

The Perfected of Pure Emptiness said: On every *jiazi* day, one must bathe.

The Lady of Purple Tenuity said: Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*. To oppose the *po* and reverse this is to refine its turbidity and filth, so that the *po* naturally perishes.

*From the* Declarations of the Perfected

Whenever one contemplates the Upper Dao and prays to expel the Three Worms, one should gather the roots of *bai zhi* and *qing mu xiang*, boil them in east-flowing water, and bathe the body with the decoction to repel all blood corpses and malevolent qi. It may also be blended into incense and burned to summon the divine luminaries. If *qing mu xiang* is unavailable, *bai zhi* alone may be used.

*From the* Scripture of the Yellow Writ of the Great Cavern in Forty-Four Methods

The Yellow Thearch said: Celestial Elder, seeing that the lesser omens did not know the celestial qi, received the *Scripture of the Five Numinous Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* and, according to the prognostication of the Eastern Well, bathed and purified himself on an auspicious day to receive the Numinous Treasure talismans in fasting and stillness. The times are:
- The *rending* hour of the tenth day of the first month,
- The dusk hour of the eighth day of the second month,

The times are further:
- The sunset hour of the sixth day of the third month,
- The sun’s glow hour of the fourth day of the fourth month,
- The midday hour of the fifth month,
- The *si* hour of the twenty-ninth day of the fifth month,
- The breakfast hour of the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month,
- The early breakfast hour of the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month,
- The sunrise hour of the twenty-second day of the eighth month,
- The third cockcrow hour of the twentieth day of the ninth month,
- The first cockcrow hour of the eighteenth day of the tenth month,
- The hour past midnight of the fifteenth day of the eleventh month,
- The midnight hour of the twelfth day of the twelfth month.

On these days, the celestial *qi* and the lunar lodgings of the Eastern Well converge with the incense of divine immortals; bathing on these days ensures the descent of the gods.

*From the* Scripture of the True One of the Cavern Mystery in Five Numinous Talismans

The Heavenly River irrigates the Eastern Well,
Stone radiance, the essence of the Water Mother.
Round light sweeps the numinous luminaries,
Mysterious brilliance gleams in the heights.

The Primordial Beginning parts the layered night,
Heavenly beings follow the moon’s birth.
Bathing by the rippling pool,
Dragons bear the long-rope jar.

Golden youths sprinkle fragrant blossoms,
Jade maidens stream the Five Stars.
Crowns and sashes laved in jade rhythms,
Refining and transmuting the forms of the Five Immortals.

The body perfumed, myriad gods descend,
Riding the light to ascend the heights.

*From the* Scripture of the Twenty-Four Birth Diagrams of the Cavern Mystery

Use three *hu* of water, four *liang* of *qing mu xiang*, seven *liang* of true sandalwood, and two *liang* of *xuan shen*. Combine and boil until one bubbling. When done, allow to settle and adjust to a suitable temperature for self-bathing. This is the method of the Heavenly Perfected Jade Maidens’ Mystic Water, called the *Refining the Womb Spirit Water*.

*From the* Scripture of the Cavern Spirits, *Entering the Chamber Chapter*

The Lady of the Southern Marchmount says: When entering a quiet chamber, first step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot forward to align with the right. Once done, proceed as usual, so that one’s announcement may be presented and reach the ears above.

*From the* Declarations of the Perfected, *Lamp-Lighting Chapter*

The Lord Emperor constantly dwells within the Radiant Jasper Terrace and the Golden Chamber of Purple Doors, illuminating himself with the Luminous Mystic Lamp, extending its distant light through the eight windows. He contemplates the Great Perfected within the Five Forms, unfolds the Three Vows in the Imperial Chamber, and with emptiness above descends beneath the Purple Canopy. In the midst of nothingness, Golden Youths attend him. Naturally, he is hailed as the Lord of the Imperial Seat, governing the Mystic Palace in its entirety. The Great Scripture arises from the beginning; the wondrous Dao resides in the faintest glimmer. Now I reveal this to you—diligently uphold it.

He addressed the Upper Prime Lady of the Southern Marchmount, saying: You study the Way of the Divine Perfected and dwell above the Void Palace within the Jasper Chamber, yet you do not know to illuminate yourself with the Luminous Lamp, nor to extend the Mystic Light within the Five Viscera. Through this, you may attain clarity, and the spirits of your form and body may thereby return.

If you can light a lamp at dusk for your Original Destiny, light a lamp at dawn for your Active Year, and constantly light a lamp for the Grand Year-Star, then in these three places, your vows and contemplations will cause your body to become serene and your qi upright. The true light will shine within, and the myriad spirits will become radiantly clear.

If the Prime Lady upholds this method and practices it for three years, she will summon the Twenty-Four Night-Light Youths, whose Mystic Light will naturally illuminate, and she will no longer need to light lamps to extend her light.

If you obtain this Way and practice it for nine years, your body will become luminous, allowing you to see clearly for ten thousand miles. At dawn, you will observe the natural world, and at night, the Night-Light Youths will descend to your chamber.

Constantly light a lamp above your Original Destiny in the quiet chamber where you reside. At dusk, enter the chamber, face the lamp, and kneel. Strike your teeth twelve times and pray:

The Mystic Light illumines the Great Yin,
Eight directions shine with dawn’s clarity.
Within the secluded chamber, the body becomes serene,
Gazing upward, the radiance pierces the Highest Clarity.
The Five Clarities arise from the Luminous Terrace,
Jade Mushrooms naturally grow.
The penetrating light connects to the Great Perfected,
The myriad spirits oversee my form.
Dispelling the Nine Yin qi,
Inscribe my name in the Eastern Flower.
Preserve me without end,
Ever parallel to the sun and moon.
Deliverance from the Seven Dark Perils,
In the Southern Palace, receive renewed glory.
The Luminous Light invokes the Jade Emperor,
To receive the Scripture of Inner Contemplation.
Heaven sends the Flying Cloud Chariot,
Ascending through space, drawn by the Green Carriage.
Attaining audience in the Palace of the Great Emperor,
Advancing to bow in the Jade Emperor’s court.

Afterward, bow twice, face your Original Destiny, raise your head, and swallow saliva seven times.

Constantly light a lamp above your Active Year. At dawn, face the lamp, strike your teeth twelve times, and pray:

The bright lamp illumines my Active Year,
Scattering light that gleams in eight directions.
The radiant countenance becomes serene,
Inner contemplation shines through the empty cavern.
Unfastening the divine sash of the Spirit Child,
I commune above with the Jade Perfected.
Gazing upward to the Highest Dao,
Its cultivation vast, without trace or track.
I aspire to the descent of the Mystic Numinous,
To rein in and ride the flying dragon.
Reversing my hundred-year span,
Restoring the visage of an infant.
Bestow upon me the Western Flower Maiden,
Grant me the Golden Dawn Youth.
Attending the incense, tending to my years and destiny,
I bow my head in the Jade Emperor’s chamber.
The spirits arrive, the Way flows smoothly,
Delighted and at ease amidst the fragrant smoke.
Composing the heart, I focus on the Great Mysterious,
My essence moves the Cavernous Void.
The chamber summons the descent of Divine Aurora,
My eyes behold the Lords of the Immortal Capital.
Delivering my seven ancestors from peril,
Transforming my form to return to the Southern Palace.

Afterward, bow twice, face the lamp, and swallow qi twenty-seven times.

Constantly light a lamp above the Grand Year-Star to commune with the spirits and seek the Perfected. After three years, the Mystic Light will shine within, and the Divine Perfected will descend to bestow upon you the formula of immortality. At that time, there will naturally be a response.

Morning and evening, burn incense, strike your teeth twelve times, face the lamp, and pray:

The lamp’s flame illumines the Great Perfected,
The bright light pierces the Mystic Void.
Unfolding the Radiant Supreme Dao,
The heart focuses on the Jade Emperor’s abode.
Penetrating the empty vastness within,
The spirit beholds the body at ease.
Accumulated resonance summons the numinous descent,
The heart tranquil, the principles subtly unfold.
At dawn, I pay homage in the Great Emperor’s hall,
At dusk, I recite the Golden Perfected’s scripture.
Carefree within the Mystic Cavern,
For ten thousand years, I return to infancy.
A heavenly crown of purple aurora,
The Emperor grants a green jasper carriage.
Roaming the peaks of the Five Marchmounts,
At ease, attaining what the heart desires.
The seven ancestors escape the Three Wretched Paths,
Blessings and joy overflow in abundance.

Afterward, bow twice and swallow saliva fourteen times.

If you can constantly keep lamps lit in these three places without extinguishing them, the ancestors of the Seven Darks will escape the Ten Sufferings, ascend to the Southern Immortals, and your body will become serene and upright. The Divine Perfected will descend, the Night-Light will naturally shine, and the light will extend within and without.

*From the* Scripture of the Three Celestial Passes of the Cavern Perfection, *Seven Stars’ Transference of Destiny*

**Hymn of the Luminous Lamp:**

The Most High scatters light in ten directions,
Flowering lamps convey sincerity and essence.
All heavens are likewise,
All earths become radiantly clear.
My body, too, shines through,
The Five Viscera flourish with splendor.
The blazing light illumines the Great Void,
Distant thoughts flourish in the Jade Clarity.
Cinnabar essence lodges in the Great Void,
The Mystic Yang resounds in the empty midst.
Embracing form, eradicating the roots of suffering,
Profound and wondrous, the contemplation of the True.
Dangling blossoms, unseen in substance,
Causal conditions manifest as light and image.
My body is likewise,
Riding transformation, entrusting to the flowing radiance.
The Night-Light reveals the Yang Elixir,
Shining afar into the numinous chamber.
All heavens universally display their light,
All yin is extinguished.
My spirit, too, becomes keen and bright,
Delighting in wisdom and insight.
Carefree, adapting to the Dao’s movement,
Changing and fading, following heaven’s power.
Grasping form, treading the empty cavern,
The night candle gleams with flowing splendor.

Whenever you see a lit lamp, you should gently strike your teeth three times and recite this text.

The Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity says: Lighting lamps without knowing this recitation allows the demonic palaces of the Six Heavens to pass over people, bringing death and fate from eight directions. The heavens will not send Jade Youths or Principal Maidens, nor will Flying Heavenly Spirits descend to you. The Ten Directions and Three Realms will not inscribe your immortal name in the Eastern Flower, and the Southern Palace will not receive the transformative Way of your seven ancestors and parents.

**Method for Crafting Mystic Nourishing Incense:**

Combine one *hu* of sesame paste, one *jin* of true sandalwood, one *jin* of *qingmuxiang*, one *liang* of *xuanshen*, and three *liang* of fragrant beads. Pound them to pieces and place them into the paste, seal tightly, and simmer over a low flame for half a day until ready for use as lamp oil.

*From the* Scripture of the Cavern Spirit

**Incense Varieties**
**Method for Crafting Supreme Primordial Fragrant Beads:**
Use three *jin* of *chenxiang*, two *jin* of *xunluxiang*, nine *liang* of *qingmuxiang*, five *liang* of *jishexiang*, three *liang* of *xuanshen*, six *liang* of *quetoixiang*, two *liang* of *Zhanchengxiang*, two *liang* of *baizhi*, four *liang* of true sandalwood, three *liang* of *aixiang*, four *liang* of *anxijiao*, and three *liang* of *mulan*. Pound each of the twelve ingredients separately and sift through silk. Once done, add ten *liang* of jujubes and pound thirty thousand times. Place the mixture into a vessel, seal tightly, and steam for one day. Afterward, blend with honey, pound again, and form into beads the size of *wutong* seeds. Thread them with green cord and dry in the sun. These are the Three Sovereigns’ True Primordial Fragrant Beads; burning them perfumes the Nine Heavens.

*From the* Scripture of the Cavern Spirit

The Lady of Southern Marchmount says: When burning incense, do not look back. Looking back disrupts the true *qi* and invites demonic responses.

*From the* Declarations of the Perfected

The Lord Azure Lad says: Those who engage in concentrated meditation should first burn incense to their left and right.

*From the* Scripture of Daoist Traces

**Section on Striking the Teeth**

**Section on Striking the Teeth**

The method of striking the teeth: striking the left against the left is called "Breaking the Heavenly Bell." Striking the right against the right is called "Breaking the Heavenly Chime." Striking the upper and lower teeth together at the center is called "Sounding the Heavenly Drum." If suddenly encountering inauspicious omens or malevolence, one should strike the Heavenly Bell thirty times. When traversing mountains to ward off evil, invoking mighty spirits with solemn incantations, one should strike the Heavenly Chime. When meditating upon the Dao, summoning the true and beckoning the numinous, one should sound the Heavenly Drum. Though the act of striking the teeth is singular, in truth it distinguishes left and right, upper and lower. Thus, malevolence fears the resonance of the Heavenly Bell; mountain spirits dread the motion of the Heavenly Chime; and the summoning of spirits is solemnized by the thunder of the Heavenly Drum. The notes of *gong* and *shang* follow their rhythms, subtly stirring inner resonance—one cannot seek uniformity in all things. In myriad affairs and countless matters, this principle holds. The art of striking the teeth unfolds thus, and the sounds of bell and drum differ. Therefore, the methods of the Dao must not be transgressed or confused; techniques must not be jumbled or disordered. Transgression and confusion lead to obscurity and failure; disorder brings clamor and ruin. It is not that the profound lacks coherence, but that practicing coherence without order prevents the Dao from being realized and affairs from being verified. The true path to seeking the real cannot be trodden by following tracks that lead to many faults. Striking the Heavenly Bell thirty times is not for other invocations but merely to dispel inauspiciousness. If there is a specific case at hand, follow the appropriate method; the number of strikes need not be limited to thirty.

*From the* Scripture of the Cavern Realms’ Hidden Writings of the Supreme Lord

All methods of invoking the upper realms through striking the teeth and swallowing saliva follow specific directions, with a proper sequence that must not be disordered or mixed, lest the true spirits become confused.

Striking the teeth commands the spirits; swallowing *qi* harmonizes the true. Inhaling harmony and swallowing the six fluids to circulate them, one governs the spirits by sounding the drum to set them in order. Whenever practicing the upper methods, performing rites, or making invocations, first tap the upper and lower teeth together, without striking left or right. With each breath, let there be three strikes—this is best. After completing the rites and invocations, strike the teeth again before swallowing the various *qi* and fluids. This is called "calling the spirits and harmonizing the true" to seek ascent as an immortal.

*From the* Declarations of the Perfected

**Section on Incantations and Invocations**

Whenever Daoists retreat into mountain forests to meditate and seek communion with the numinous, or when reciting cavern scriptures and emitting resonant sounds, they are often tested and thwarted by the Great Demon of the Northern Emperor. At dusk and night, one should strike the teeth thirty-six times, then recite the following incantation:

Great Demon King of the Northern Emperor,
Before the Lord who receives your service,
Ghosts of the Yellow Springs, the Four Brightnesses, and Mount Feng.
A thousand demons with jumbled forms, nine heads sharing one body.
Divine tigers spewing venom, beheading with thunderous might.
Divine Lords uttering curses, slaying without partiality.
By the command of the Grand Tenuity, mountains and rivers are subdued.
Ringing bells cast as one, radiance flows through the Nine Heavens.
Wind and fire launch expeditions, divine blades arrayed in thousands.
Malevolent spirits are subdued and destroyed, myriad demons annihilated.
Should any demonic toxin dare arise, it shall be sealed within the Three Passes.
I invoke the cavern law—let none disobey these words.

After reciting, strike the teeth another thirty-six times. This is the correct method of the Three Heavens for invoking and subduing demonic spirits. Practicing it regularly ensures that divine soldiers stand guard, mountain and river spirits are subdued, a thousand demons are sealed away, and myriad evils cannot intrude.

Whenever Daoists travel alone and lodge in mountain forests or temple precincts—places teeming with demonic spirits and malevolent ghosts—first strike the teeth thirty-six times, hold the breath, and softly recite:

Yang *qi* of the Great Emperor,
Four Netherworld Gates and hidden passes,
A thousand demons and myriad toxins—
Dare any confront me?
Divine beasts with layered jaws, rending bellies and devouring livers.
Divine envoys of efficacious power, guarding and defending the encampment.
Soldiers of the Yellow Prime Master, slaying and vanquishing demonic ghosts.
Sincerity destroys a thousand demons, crushing and casting down the wicked.
Extinguishing their kind, severing their lineage, seizing their lives and annihilating them.
Jade Emperor and Supreme Lord, purify and sweep the Three Origins.

After reciting, strike the teeth another thirty-six times. This is called the "Inner Invocation of the Supreme Emperor to Brandish the Divine," the method for sealing and destroying myriad demons. Regular recitation ensures that divine soldiers appear for protection, myriad ghosts submit to service, and a thousand demons remain eternally subdued.

*From the* Scripture of the Yellow Simplicities of the Cavern Realms’ Forty-Four Methods

For all who make vows, seek the Dao, present petitions, or conduct affairs, first face east, strike the teeth three times, hold incense, and recite the incantation:

Supreme Three Heavens,
Primordial Three *Qi* of the Mysterious Origin,
Most High Lord Lao,
Summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers of my body,
Left and right official envoys,
Left and right incense-bearers,
Courier dragon riders,
Incense-attending Golden Lads,
Jade Maidens who transmit words,
Direct talismans of the Five Emperors—
Let thirty-six of each emerge.
Open the local earth gods and the true officials of the four directions.
As I now burn incense and make this invocation,
May the *qi* of the ten directions’ true and correct ones enter my body,
So that what I invoke may ascend directly to the presence of the Most High, Perfect, and Great Sage, the Jade Emperor.

Whenever those who study the Dao make vows, seek something, or practice the upper methods, failure to first make this invocation allows demonic and evil forces to intrude, preventing their efforts from reaching the upper realms. Their practices will lack resonance, the divine will not witness them, and their labor will be in vain.

The Dao states: Those who study the upper methods, meditate upon spirits, contemplate the Dao, dwell in mountains with tranquil minds, practice purification rites, recite scriptures, deliver the seven ancestors, and seek immortality for themselves—when performing the upper methods of the Five Elders’ Red Writ of the True Text, they must follow the ancient texts. First strike the teeth eleven times and recite the incantation:

Mysterious and exalted numinous ones,
Venerable Divine Origin.
Great Sage who lingers, myriad perfected ones who attend.
Three luminaries spread their radiance, auspicious clouds arrayed on four sides.
Above, the auspicious charts are examined, the Nine Heavens calculated.
Today I make my vow and present my petition to the numinous mountain.
Cinnabar script in red characters, the natural true text.
Report to the Five Emperors, inscribe my name in the Jade Register.
Myriad spirits witness and reflect, sun and moon clearly attest.
May I attain deliverance, may I attain life, may I attain spirit, may I attain immortality.
Heaven and earth, stars and constellations, mystically illuminate my body.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, great spirits of the Five Marchmounts.
Universally proclaim without end, erase the roots of my sins.

The Primordial Beginning unfurls, none dare withhold their words.
Seven generations of shadowed souls receive blessings by nature’s grace.
Three paths and five sufferings, forever parted from eight perils.
Attaining union with the Three Luminaries, together they shine in the purple dawn.
Revolving without end, the body ascends as a flying immortal.

When finished, read the petition aloud and cast it into the abyss of sheer cliffs,
then scatter incense upon the numinous mountain.
Again, knock the teeth three times and pray toward one’s life-destiny, saying:
May the Primordial Beginning witness and reflect—my immortal name is inscribed.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, no sin remains unabsolved.
Scatter incense to the Five Emperors, pledge alliance with the Great Void.
Let what has been petitioned stand, dwelling through ten thousand kalpas.

When done, raise the head and swallow the ninefold qi to conclude.

The Rite of Presenting Aspirations to the Imperial Lord’s Five Vows for Ascension

On the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month,
the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month,
and the seventh day of the seventh month—these are the five vows and ten assemblies of the year.
Ascend to the Jade Terrace of the Great Ultimate, within the golden chamber of the Jade Palace,
and meditate upon the Five Vows in the secluded sanctuary.
Yearn for the Mysterious True One to descend of their own accord,
and with emptiness and non-being, present a jade missive.
Let the golden sound resound through the Great Void,
summon the Five Emperors to guard the numinous,
and celebrate the myriad assemblies in the cinnabar chamber.
Thus, through devotion, the true ones are moved to respond,
and the true ones, stirred by devotion, descend.

On that day, bathe in purity and fast,
enter the chamber to burn incense,
bow in reverence to the four directions,
and sit upright facing east.
East is the direction of eternal yang and the first radiance.

Knock the teeth thirty-six times.

First Vow: May I be born of the qi of nature,
may qi coalesce to form my body,
may my body turn in unison with the Three Luminaries,
and may I eternally partake of the root of boundless existence.

Second Vow: May my body ever dwell above the Great Void,
within the jade palace and gemstone chamber,
feasting with the Jade Emperor by day,
sharing a table with the Mysterious Mother by night.
When thirsty, may I drink from the vast wellspring and jade mushrooms;
when hungry, may I consume dragon embryos, jade-rich fat, and the red fruits of the descending tree.

Third Vow: May my body bear ten thousand marvels,
seventy-two radiant lights, wondrous fur and extraordinary bones.
May I don feathered robes and soar,
riding the void and mounting the sky,
entering and exiting the imperial palace,
with myriad blessings converging,
and boundless longevity.

Fourth Vow: May I be born with the non-existent,
may I die with the non-existent,
dying yet living again,
and in life becoming lord of the empire.
May I govern the Ten Heavens,
overseeing all living beings.

Fifth Vow: May all sentient beings, born and unborn,
together preserve the Three Luminaries of sun, moon, and stars.
May those of the Dao and the sevenfold ancestors of the Mysterious ascend to the Southern Palace.
May the world’s blessings be without exception,
and may the Five Vows of the four directions converge in the Jade Hall.

Next, present the Nine Mysteries to uphold and nurture my body,
so that the hun-soul, po-soul, and true spirit eternally dwell within my palace,
communing above with the celestial immortals,
and below with the abyssal depths.
Vow to Heaven, vow to Earth,
vow to Wind, vow to Cloud,
vow to Spirit—
the Five Vows unite as one,
inscribing my name in the register of eternal life.
Purple mists descend from Heaven,
the Five Numinous Ones guard the Earth.
Riding clouds and mounting the void,
ascending in a jade-green chariot,
I arrive at the Golden Gate,
advance to the Jade Purity,
and extend blessings to the seven generations of ancestors,
reborn into womb-existence.

The Middle Vows, also five in number, attain the root of the Dao.
Vow to Yin, vow to Yang,
vow to the Great Void, vow to the Great Non-Being,
vow to the Great Mystery.
Feasting in the Jade Chamber,
bound by destiny to the Emperor,
I roam the Gate of Life,
traverse the Nine Heavens,
recorded without a father in the register,
my years inscribed by the Mysterious Mother.
Peaches of well-being and essence congeal,
fortifying the cinnabar field.
My body ascends to the Golden Gate,
my name inscribed in the Jade Register.
Seven generations of ancestors are liberated,
and blessings converge.

The Lower Vows, also five in number:
vow to the Great Void, vow to the Great Existence,
vow to the Great True, vow to the Divine Immortals.
May I traverse the summits of the Five Marchmounts,
drift among the ninefold skies,
enter and exit the Gates of Opening,
and escape the portals of death.
Beyond these, vow that Heaven and Earth be my parents,
the Three Luminaries guard my body and years,
the myriad spirits protect the nine apertures of my source,
and true numina descend the qi of nature.
May the Five Vows of the eight directions converge as one.

When the Five Vows are complete, knock the teeth fourteen times and recite the incantation:
Supreme Emperor of the Upper Origin,
Scripture of the Imperial Unity and the Mysterious.
Five clouds scatter radiance,
pervading the Three Purities.
Jade lads and jade maidens
burn incense and attend the numinous.
The vows presented unfold,
uniting with my form,
enabling me to become a divine immortal
and ascend to the imperial court.
The Northern Emperor severs death,
the Southern Culmen inscribes life.
The Golden Register of the Eastern Florescence
records my name.
Boundless vows
unite with me as one.

When the incantation is finished, knock the teeth twenty-one times.
Raise the head and swallow qi five times to conclude.

This is the method by which the Imperial Lord presents vows and unites form with the numinous.
Those who regularly practice this will be attended by jade blossoms and guards,
jade lads scattering incense,
their ascent reaching the Nine Heavens,
moving the Emperor to respond.
After five years of such practice,
the true spirits will manifest,
and the vows of the ten directions and those of the Dao
will descend without fail.

From the *Scripture of the Three Charts of the Heavenly Pass and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Degrees*:

The Twelve Vows of the Imperial Lord are titled:
Vow to Heaven, Vow to Earth,
Vow to Wind, Vow to Cloud,
Vow to Yin, Vow to Yang,
Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Great Non-Being,
Vow to the Great Existence, Vow to Self-Generation,
Vow to Spirit-Generation.

From the *Eight Interstices of the Mysterious Mother*:
May the Mysterious Mother be born with me in the space of generative qi,
dwell with me between the sun and moon,
preserve me within the Nine Heavens,
feed with me from the natural bounty,
drink with me from the Gourd River,
rest with me in the Jade Truth,
sleep with me in the Immortal Hall,
and roam with me among the Three Mysteries.

The adept, in a separate chamber, should constantly recite this scripture,
never forgetting it for even a moment.
This is the method by which the Imperial Lord presents the Eight Interstices of Inner Vows.

Now, the immortals of the Five Marchmounts and the divine women of the Divine Continent
still partake of jade cups and sip unicorn jerky,
reciting great vows,
presenting the Eight Interstices,
awaiting the Primal Simplicity,
honoring the Three Origins,
aspiring to the Dawn of the Empyrean,
becoming Jade Perfected,
liberating seven generations,
and entering the Broad Cold Palace.
How much more so for those of the mundane world—
the base and the fivefold defilements of the humble!

How then could one dare to neglect cultivation or hesitate to practice? Though the body and spirit be refined, if one suffers through endless rebirths with seven generations of unabsolved sins, there can be no hope of immortality. One must therefore invoke the Great Vows, present the Eight Interstices, and thereby dissolve the accumulated knots of karma. Once the Seven Trials bestow their blessings, the adept shall not die; non-death is the root of attaining the Dao and the origin of becoming an immortal. Those who dedicate themselves to this practice—how could they fail to join the ranks of the eternally abiding?

The Twelve Vows of the Nine Heavens’ Imperial Lord are titled thus:

**First Vow:** To the Nine Numinous Mysterious Mother, the Eight Gate Spirit Tablets, the Five Penetrations of Primordial Return, and the dispelling of worldly calamities; to bestow blessings upon the seven ancestors, to attain immortality in one’s own person, to meditate in the secluded chamber, to scatter incense and rectify the smoke, and to recite the *Scripture of the Golden Flower of the Great Cavern*, saying:

*To the Northern Culmen Heavenly Sovereign, the Supreme Unity Imperial Lord; to the Two Radiant Circles of Jade Purity and Purple Void; to the Supreme Great Dao; to the Three Origins of Primal Simplicity; to the Four Directions and Five Elders; to the Six Canopies and Seven Dawns; to the Eight Superiors and Nine Numinous Ones; to the Hidden Dao and Returning Origin; to the Mysterious Mother and Five Penetrations; to the Golden Flower High Immortals; to the Celestial Master Who Oversees Life; to the Heavenly Spirits Who Govern Birth; to the Qi of the Supreme Subtlety Heaven—by virtue of this offering, may the Nine Mysterious Ones protect my soul and sustain my spirit, may the luminous primordial qi converge within me. I raise my gaze to summon the Five Penetrations of the Supreme Immortals above, and bow to invoke the Hidden Dao and Returning Origin below. May the accumulated sins of seven generations, measured by the Dipper, now be dispersed. May I receive blessings in the Southern Palace, where incense is sprinkled and the Eight Gates open.*

**Vow to Heaven, Vow to Earth, Vow to Wind, Vow to Clouds—**
when these four vows unite, the register of longevity is secured.
Heaven nurtures the root of the embryo,
Earth aids the radiant spirit.
The divine wind fans with eight wings,
the luminous clouds flow and fill.
I and the Imperial Lord
ascend together to the Upper Clarity.
Gazing toward the Northern Mystery,
untying my sash in the Jade Court,
I celebrate the seven ancestors,
and the Mysterious Trials yield their blessings.

**Second Set of Four Vows:**
May the four directions be illuminated,
and my lifespan rival the sun’s decline.
The middle vows, also four, govern the administration of the Imperial Scriptures:
**Vow to Yin, Vow to Yang, Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Supreme Non-Being.**
Here dwell the Three and Five Luminous Spirits,
the abodes of the Seven and Nine.
The Imperial Lord has no father,
for he was born at the dawn of fixed life.
The Jade Emperor’s chariot congeals,
ever present at my dwelling.
I abide in the Purple Chamber,
where the Mud-Pellet Palace flourishes.
Yin congeals and blood is fortified,
the soul is born in the Great Yang.
The numinous void reflects its radiance,
the Supreme Origin strides onward.
The Nine Qi of the Void
clothe me in yellow robes.
The Seven Trials confer blessings,
and I receive immortality in the Southern Palace.

**Third Set of Four Vows:**
For a life eternal in the Immortal Palace,
**Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Great Possession.**
May the spirit dwell in the Nine Heavens,
the form wander the true realm.
The Imperial Lord merges and harmonizes,
revolving through the Seven and Nine.
Misfortune departs my chamber,
fortune comes to me.
Evil words vanish and are forgotten,
while compliant words and good deeds flourish.
**Further Vow:** May I be born of Heaven and Earth as my father.
**Further Vow:** May my spirit be born of harmonious qi as my mother.
The Five Penetrations of Returning Origin
dispel the stains of sin.
Blessings crown seven generations,
transcending life after life.
May my vows ascend to the August Emperor,
may the Imperial Lord join in the chant.
The chant’s tones soar to the empyrean,
eight echoes resound ten thousandfold.
The numinous brush reverses the balance,
a thousand perfected ones share the reward.
From kalpa to kalpa,
we shall forever celebrate the Twelve Joys.
Great is the Imperial Lord’s grace—
ten thousand blessings return in the Mirror of Origin.

**Further Vows:** The Mysterious Mother of the Eight Interstices composes the divine chant of the Eight Interstices, her gaze profound as the Nine Numinous Cavern.

**First Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother be born with me amid the qi of life, that the Purple Radiance may illumine the void and the celestial and human realms unite in accord; may flying immortals bathe in feathers, and I join them; may heavenly music delight the heart, freeing me from a hundred sorrows; may the Seven Mysterious Ones construct blessings, upheld by the Supreme Spirits.

**Second Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother abide with me amid the sun and moon, at the juncture of the Three Luminaries, where the Great Emperor’s chariots run parallel, where azure banners and emerald canopies, embroidered carriages and brocade robes, jade belts and jeweled sashes accompany the Five Elders, joining the Four Great Ones as guests, entering the banquet of the Flowery Canopy, gazing beyond the Eight Extremities.

**Third Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother guard me amid the Nine Heavens, where the True Perfection congeals and leaps, the mind is inwardly refined, and qi overflows the Cloud Hall, summoning myriad spirits. May my body ascend to the Nine Empyreans, the Trials bestow layered blessings, the sash loosen into the Void, the wheels stack to the heavens. May seven generations prosper, and I, reborn as a human, safeguard the Supreme Perfected, sharing the sun’s longevity.

**Fourth Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother dine with me amid the natural, forever departing the Three Wretched Realms, eternally joining the natural. May the Seven Treasures and jade nectar, the golden elixir and purple effulgence, the hidden mushrooms plucked right and left, the night-glowing pearls, phoenix brain, and tiger foam, the cloud jades and frost of langgan, and rare delicacies be my sustenance, my body brushing the Great Void.

**Fifth Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother drink with me amid the Gourd River, where the flowing springs cascade a myriad cliffs, pure and sweet. May the returning waters and jade essence, the numinous moisture and azure blue, pour upward to the remotest empyrean, streaming into the divine hall. May the waves surge and swell, stirring the Great Void, floating and roaming the vast clarity. Drinking and rinsing at the Eastern Peak, I bow to the Dawn of the Empyrean, entrusting my joy to the azure waves. May the Seven Trials attain immortality, blessings overflowing, the body pledged to the Nine Rivers, all directions prospering.

**Sixth Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother rest with me amid the Jade Truth, where the exalted seat stretches vast, the abyss profound and the empyrean clear. May the Five Elders array the chamber, the Jade Flower proclaim the numinous, the Queen Mother’s flying carriage and feathered banners stream past. May I rest with her in the courtyard of the Nine Mysterious Ones, the Seven Trials celebrated, the embryo received and reborn, the body coiled in the jade realm, the spirit nesting in perfect clarity.

**Seventh Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother sleep with me amid the Immortal Hall, where the secluded chamber is numinous and remote, the Mysterious Flower arrayed on four sides. The vermilion hall is phoenix-wrought, radiant light illuminating the carriage. The golden bed and jade couch, the purple curtains and dragon gates, the exalted seat of the Mysterious Emperor, the central mat of the Heavenly Perfected—I occupy the right, entwined in sashes. May the Seven Trials receive great blessings, the scriptures bestowed, and immortality attained.

**Eighth Vow:** May the Mysterious Mother roam with me amid the Three Mysteries, where the reins are loosed in the Great Desert, the carriage turns through the Three Mysterious Realms. May the Five Numinous Ones support my bones, the Queen Mother stand shoulder to shoulder with me. Dancing carriages on the divine mound, halting the chariot in the Nine Heavens, the scriptures of the Supreme inscribed, the rank of Perfected received. The feminine and primordial unite, from billions to thousands. The *Cavern Scripture* resounds with eight echoes, the seven ancestors attain immortality. From kalpa to kalpa, we forever gather at the Eight Interstices—where do the Eight Interstices reside?

Everlasting are the karmic conditions. The Five Elders descend with blessings, the Dao and virtue flourish abundantly, the myriad qi ascend and thrive, firmly guarding the Mud-Pill Palace. Once the vows are spoken, sun and moon share the same span. O vast and empty Primordial Mother, moving and still amid the Eight Gates.

—Excerpted from the *Scripture of the Five Mornings of Concealed Primordial Gold-Flowered Jade of the Cavern Reality*

The eight nodal days of the year are all days when the immortals of the Three Heavens gather for audience and ritual assembly. When the adept performs the rites, makes vows, and pays homage to the deities, they should always choose these days. As for the rites performed at the new and full moons, these are not of the highest method.

On any of these days when one wishes to perform the rites and make vows, at the time of presenting the prayers, one should first knock the teeth seven times, bow in the heart to the four directions, and softly pray:

Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor, Three Primordial Sovereign Ladies of the Plain,
Most High and Lofty Spirits, Great Divinities of the Immortal Capital.
On this auspicious day, the Eight Vows are declared.
The highest vow: to soar through the clouds, attaining long life as a divine immortal.
The middle vow: for heaven and earth to unite in radiant winds and clouds.
The lower vow: for the five viscera to remain with the body forever.
Next vow: for the seven ancestors to be released from nets and freed from transgressions.
Further vow: for the Lord Emperor to sever the roots of the womb’s bonds.
Sixth vow: for generation after generation, wisdom to unfold.
Seventh vow: to extinguish demons, beheading the gods of the Six Heavens.
Eighth vow: for numinous descent, perceiving clearly east and west.
May the highest vow be fulfilled, and none fail to come to pass.
Vows to the spirits, vows to the immortals, ascending to pay homage to the Three Origins.

After the prayer, bow again as before. One may also express one’s intentions freely, seeking liberation for the seven ancestors’ transgressions, the sins of the head and body, to be appended to the conclusion of the ritual. This is called the *Concealed Prayer of the Three Origins and Eight Audiences*, the essential method of the highest vows to the immortals. Practicing this for three years will dissolve the sins of the seven generations of ancestors, parents, and oneself. Thereafter, the Jade Flower will descend to guard, and the spirits will respond in resonance. When the Eight Vows are declared, one will surely obtain the essential契 of the numinous.

—From the *Dongxuan Dingzhi Jing*

The study of the Dao begins with a sincere heart,
Honoring one’s teacher as one’s closest kin.
Drawing in the luminous and aligning with clarity,
Diligently progressing with each new day.
While others remain undelivered,
One must not seek deliverance for oneself alone.
Great vows bear weighty recompense,
And profound virtue is surely thus.

Deep-rooted sins of hidden evil
Return like a turning wheel.

—From the *Dongxuan Yinzhu Jing*

The Immortal Duke inquired of the Supreme Master of the Great Ultimate Perfected One: "What cultivation of fundamental conduct allows one to receive blessings in this life, ensuring one’s family and lineage are upright, descendants prosperous, and good karmic connections unbroken across generations, ascending to the heavenly halls above or being reborn among humans in the households of marquises and kings, endowed with wisdom, benevolence, and reverence for the scriptures, delighting in mountains and rivers, constantly reciting subtle teachings, and ultimately attaining the Dao of immortality?"

The Master replied: "Excellent is your question! Each person’s life has its fundamental conduct, the roots of destiny from past causes, with myriad interconnections, vows following one another, like attracting like, unfolding in succession, fortune and misfortune drawing one another—thus their continuity across lifetimes. Their preferences differ, their intentions vary, all stemming from prior vows.

To cultivate the Dao and forge bonds with the worthy and sagely, one must uphold the great precepts, widely establish fields of blessing, and vastly initiate meritorious deeds. Some may thereby attain the rank of flying immortals, some celestial immortals, and some earthbound immortals."

Some may thereby attain rebirth in heavenly realms through the transcendence of their allotted lifespan; some may become spirits and deities; some may ascend as officials under the Six Heavenly Demon Kings; some may directly attain rebirth in the households of marquises and kings, honored among men; some may become objects of universal reverence, possessing all under heaven in abundance; some may attain keen intelligence and wisdom; some may acquire dignified bearing, resonant voice, and fragrant qi; some may be beloved for their loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and simplicity; some may excel in literary composition, their every movement a model of propriety; some may command awe and reverence, even from the most generous patrons; some may devote themselves to the Three Treasures, offering unwavering reverence, delighting in mountains and rivers, cherishing the purity of scriptures, burning incense, and observing fasts; some may venerate the Mysterious Origin; some may have their female form transformed into male, their appearance refined and elegant; some may ensure their household’s solemn purity, their karmic bonds spanning generations, their original vows fulfilled, and virtuous sages reborn as their descendants, bringing boundless peace and nobility; some may reap blessings in this life and receive their due reward at life’s end; some may inherit blessings in future lives, receiving the merit of their past deeds.

What, then, is the purpose of the Dao? It is to respond to all beings without deliberate intent. The four assemblies cultivate blessings and virtue, each according to their original vows. The rewards of blessings all stem from the vows one establishes in due time. Once meritorious deeds are performed and aspirations are set, their recompense is as certain as the coming of dawn after dusk.

Yet the people of the world, shallow and faithless, dismiss the Dharma’s teachings as mere "ghostly marks," following their own whims, scorning past karma as fabrication, mocking the sacred scriptures as falsehoods. They glut themselves on desires, expecting immediate rewards for their meager offerings, demanding swift returns while the Way’s response remains distant. Thus, the profound teachings grow dim, the world’s moral order collapses, and heaven and humanity suffer—all due to their own misguided conduct. The Supreme One laments this deeply.

The Heavenly Lord of the Southern Culmen said: "Those who seek the Dao of immortality must first establish their vows before pursuing their goal. The numinous responds to the sincerity of vows—such is the greatness of vows. Vows encompass all, blessings cover all, and felicity flows to all. Truly, they are the touchstone of goodness. If one’s heart is wholly devoted to vows, they will invariably evoke a response."

*From the* **Scripture of Questions Posed to the Mysterious** *(Dongxuan Qingwen Jing), excerpted in* **The Supreme Secret Essentials** *(Wushang Biyao), Scroll 74.*

**Scroll 76 of *The Supreme Secret Essentials*: The Chapter on Ingesting the Five Qi**

The Five True Writings of the Primordial Vermilion Script emerged within the Great Void. Before heaven and earth bore light, before the dawn of creation, the primordial root coalesced, the Three Radiances formed the Mysterious, and the five qi flowed forth. The five colors divided their brilliance, illuminating the five directions. The Five Thearchs were established, yin and yang guided their course, the pivot of the Nine Heavens turned, and the luminosity of the Five Stars revolved. The Five Marchmounts were planted to secure and pacify, while the Five Palaces were nourished to cultivate the spirit. Thus, those of utmost perfection constantly rely upon the first glimmer of yang’s light: above, they guide the primordial qi of the Origin; below, they draw the fragrant flow of Jade Spring. They direct the primordial essence to the Supreme Ultimate, summon the Five Thearchs within the numinous youth. Those who irrigate with it do not decay; those who preserve it know no end. They reverse the myriad kalpas to renew themselves, safeguarding the Five Sprouts within their countenance. Truly, this is the wondrous secret of the Numinous Treasure, the profound teaching of the myriad sages.

**Method for Cultivating the Azure Sprout: Guiding and Drawing the Nine Qi of the Azure Heaven in the East**

On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), at cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Azure Numinous Origin Elder Lord of the Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove in the East—surnamed Yan, named *Kaiming*, styled *Lingweiyang*—his form nine inches tall, wearing a crown of azure essence-jade, clad in a flying robe of nine qi azure feathers. He rides a chariot drawn by a green dragon, bearing a [missing character] banner, attended by the nine hundred thousand officials of the *Jiayi* Hu Elder from the Nine Qi Azure Heaven, descending into the chamber. In an instant, azure qi transforms and arises, dense as layered clouds of mist, enveloping one’s form. It enters through the mouth and descends directly into the Liver Palace.

Next, visualize Jupiter shining brilliantly in the east, its light illuminating one’s body, all made vivid and clear. Then open the eyes and recite the incantation while looking upward:

After visualization, swallow them whole. Then the qi will descend unbidden, and the Azure Thearch will manifest in response. The Five Sprouts will be fortified within the Liver Palace of the Eastern Marchmount, and jade mushrooms will spontaneously grow within the numinous youth. Keep the true writ beside your sleeping place, and the Azure Essentials will assist and command. After nine years of accumulated resonance, transformation will be swiftly accomplished. As an immortal transcending the world, you will endure for ten thousand kalpas without decline.

Sit upright, click the teeth three times, and visualize the Vermilion Numinous True Elder Lord of the Flourishing Treasure and Prosperous Yang in the South—surnamed *Dongfu*, named *Jiyan*, styled *Chibiaonu*—his form three inches tall, wearing a crown of vermilion essence-jade, clad in a flying robe of three qi cinnabar feathers. He rides a chariot drawn by a vermilion dragon, bearing a red banner, attended by the three hundred thousand officials of the *Bingding* Yue Elder from the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven, descending into the chamber. In an instant, vermilion qi transforms and arises, glowing like the brilliance of fire, enveloping one’s form. It enters through the mouth and descends directly into the Heart Palace.

Descending from the midst of the Five Qi Dark Heaven, he enters the chamber, where in an instant he transforms and generates black qi, its luminosity layered and shimmering like the brilliance of shooting stars. This radiance envelops your form, then enters through the mouth and descends directly into the Palace of the Sages.

Next, visualize the Water Star blazing in the north, its light illuminating your body, making all distinct. Then, open your eyes, look upward, and recite the incantation:

*"Northern Dark Heaven,
Five Qi disperse their numinosity.
Above dwells the Great Spirit,
Primordial Elder without flaw.
Riding dragons, bearing banners,
Roaming and feasting in the Upper Capital.
This day is supremely auspicious,
Auspicious clouds spread their glory.
Flying mushrooms stream and scatter,
Jade pools brim on all sides.
Jade maidens of the Mystic Spring
Irrigate my form.
The Kidney Palace is filled and settled,
Rotten teeth grow firm anew.
The palace receives true qi,
Ascending to commune with the divine.
The Five Elders descend to welcome,
The immortal Dao swiftly achieved.
Transforming water and fire,
Clad in feathered azure.
Soaring through the Great Void,
Wandering to the Purple Court.
Lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries,
Eternal through ten thousand kalpas."*

The Great Mystic Jade Maidens are commanded to serve east and west. Through ten thousand kalpas, you shall not decline, and the Mystic Elder shall abide with you.

At cock’s crow, when yang radiance first divides, face north and strike the teeth five times. Rub both palms until hot, then wipe the face and eyes five times. Look upward and recite the incantation:

*"Northern Mystic Essence,
Consumed to dispel the corpse.
Imbibed with Jade Nectar,
The body soars into the Great Void."*

Then, with the tongue, gather the lower teeth and lick the lips, rinsing the mouth until Jade Mushrooms fill it, and swallow thrice. Next, draw in the black qi five times and swallow, allowing it to settle within the Kidney Palace. Thus is the Dao complete.

Harmonize essence and irrigate with qi,
Consume the Central Prime;
Jade blossoms and the Dragon Embryo,
Desire the sweet spring of the divine liquor."*

When the incantation is complete, rinse the mouth with the tongue, filling it entirely—within the Mystic Breast, inside and out, between teeth and tongue, above and below—circulating and gathering the saliva, then swallowing thirty times. Practicing this for ten years, the Central Prime Lord and the Supreme August Yellow Elder shall descend, bestowing upon you the Yellow Qi of Yang Essence, the Hidden Moon within Heaven, the Green Chapter of Lingering Radiance, and the Azure Tiger Script of the Blue Waist, all uniting with the Four Elders to ascend together.

This is the supreme method of the Jade Scripture for attaining the Way of the Five Elders, cutting off grain and shedding the corpse, the face blooming with youth, transcending cold and heat, immune to calamity and suffering. The spirit becomes luminous and clear, years extend and epochs advance, life spans lengthen by ten thousand years. When the term of ten thousand cycles is reached, one shall obtain the Nine Jade Liquors and Eight Flying Essences of the Jade, then merge with the Two Luminaries, attaining a fate equal to Heaven and Earth.

For all five silent incantations, knock the teeth nine times. They may be practiced constantly, not necessarily at cock’s crow or dawn. At midnight, when all is still and the body is pure, the spirit at ease, one may proceed accordingly.

In cultivating this Way, one may consume jujubes. If hunger arises, eat wheat-based foods to gradually dispense with grain. Do not abandon it all at once—this is what is meant by "diminishing and diminishing again, until reaching non-action." This is the Way of the Void’s reflection, the natural method, what is called "drawing afar from the essence of Heaven and Earth, and drawing near from within oneself."

The Cloud Teeth are the essence and qi of the Five Elders, the auroras of the Supreme Ultimate. Thus, one gathers the radiant brilliance of the dawn to replenish the harmony of the Six Liquids. Through profound and obscure resonance, the myriad spirits descend; in the mutual seeking of the hidden and the luminous, response arises without call.

Therefore, when the dragon intones over the abyss, rosy clouds descend from the heavens; when the tiger roars on the numinous hill, the surging winds shake the four directions. The yang burning-mirror summons light, and crimson fire blazes forth; the fang-zhu vessel employs yin, and the dark stream overflows abundantly. Such is the natural course, unfathomable and unperceived.

Moreover, when the scholar anchors the heart in the mysterious and focuses on the root of the Dao, impurities dissolve from the breast, and true correctness abides in the Three Palaces. One gathers the scattered radiance of the Five Dawns and consumes the auroral nectar of the Six Divine Liquors. One recites the rare treasures of the Nine Heavens and utters the secret words of wondrous numinosity. The dragon leaps and bounds, sevenfold brilliance shines forth. One savors the Three Blossoms upon the white teeth and draws the divine liquor from the edge of the lips. Within, the Six Palaces are refined, opening wisdom and penetrating clarity. One breathes the Primordial of Heaven, tempering the hun and po to refine the form. At dawn, one summons the Primordial to serve the Mysterious, progressing toward the numinous. After ten tranquil years, the Five Spirits shall descend—what need is there for further praise!

From the *Dao Ji Jing*, "Feeding on the Mystic Root" Chapter:

Feeding on the qi of the Mystic Root renders the body luminous and clear within, the spirit bright and the eight senses keen. The body shines like the sun, the face gleams with jade-like luster, the eyes emit radiant light, and the teeth are suffused with purple qi, granting immortality and eternal life.

Absorbing the morning liquid, suspending the root and cutting off grain, the essentials of the Way lie in the Golden Liquor, its wonders in the Water Jade. This is what is called "exhaling and inhaling the Great Harmony of the natural, and harnessing the numinous qi of the Nine Essences."

The functioning of the Heavenly Dao values the natural; the stillness of virtue honors tranquility and joy. Embracing the natural to refine the true, and holding fast to serenity to repel the perverse—thus, transgressions do not arise, and flying harms vanish of themselves. This is the meaning of the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine, the essence of the essential Way.

At the time of rising from sleep at dawn, visualize within the mouth a white qi as large as a chicken’s yolk, and beyond the two yolks, five colors. The five-colored qi swirls and generates itself, coiling outside, and in a moment fills the heart and mouth—this is called the qi of the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine, the essence of the Mystic Root.

Further, visualize within the heart and stomach a woman in the form of an infant, unclothed, standing upright within the stomach tube, her mouth open toward the entrance of the stomach tube. She is called the Mystic Woman of the Nine Heavens, who pours and infuses the liquid of the hun. Inhale the five qi of the chicken’s yolk from the mouth above. Constantly rinse the mouth inside and out, above and below, and with the tongue, draw in the five-colored qi of the sun. When the saliva fills the mouth, swallow it, visualizing the saliva descending into the mouth of the Mystic Woman. Do this five times, then knock the teeth three times and softly recite:

*"Supreme Jade Clarity,
Nine Heavens, Nine Numinous Ones,
Govern and abide in the Mysterious Center,
The human stomach, pure and cool;
Gold harmonizes with jade’s radiance,
First born from the Void,
Named ‘Cyclic Cessation,’
Styled ‘Primordial Essence,’
Tempering the hun and restraining the po,
The heart opens, the spirit brightens;
Feeding on the Solar Essence,
Golden blossoms fill and flourish."*

After a long while, when all is complete, wipe the eyes fourteen times with the hands, then rub the hands together vigorously, massaging the face between the brows, around the doors and windows, until slightly warm, imparting a lustrous hue. This is the Way of the Supreme One for consuming the Solar Essence of the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine, the Mystic Root.

The *Supreme Secret Essentials*, Scroll Seventy-Six, concludes.
Scroll Seventy-Seven is missing.

*The Supreme Secret Essentials, Scroll Seventy-Eight: Earthbound Immortals’ Medicinal Ingredients*

The Supreme Daoist Lord said: The lesser medicines include:
Pine and cypress, yin marrow, mountain ginger, hidden essence, sweet flag, asparagus root, sesame, Solomon’s seal, chrysanthemum blossoms, wolfberry, cliff honey, poria, peach bark, alisma, Solomon’s seal root, coptis, pepper and hemp, rehmannia, red cinnabar, cinnabar powder, numinous flight, and water cassia.

The varieties are numerous; these are but a brief selection. Consuming them may yield modest benefits, yet they cannot confer eternal extension. At best, one may attain seven hundred years; at least, three or four hundred. Still, they do not permit boundless enjoyment or ascension to the Pure Heavens. Yet they can restore the body’s radiance, return the complexion to youthful whiteness, command a thousand spirits, and secure the rank of Earthbound Immortal—traversing the Five Peaks on land, roaming the famed mountains at will. Thus, one need not avoid them if they prove efficacious.

One may then gradually seek the superior medicines to renew oneself, thereby ascending step by step. Why cling to the old and refuse advancement? Yet one must accept the limits of their span.

This path demands gentleness, warmth, and benevolence, wholehearted sincerity, bodily purity, and harmonization of the five viscera. One must stabilize the form and align with the luminous, preserve the hundred spirits, guard the *hun* and refine the *po*, and purge all filth and defilement. The mind wanders in the profound mystery, free from the desires of fleeting splendor; embracing the One in solitary pursuit, unburdened by worldly dust. Pungent and acrid flavors never pass the lips; rich, bloody tastes never enter the intestines. Dwelling in mountain seclusion, detached from worldly affairs, one may above delve into the profound and preserve the true, summoning spirits and wielding numinous talismans, or below ingest the Eight Minerals and practice breath and fluid refinement.

Further categories include:
The thirty-six *zhi* mushrooms, flying furnaces and refined smoke, solar waters and lunar essences, and the rich essences of the Five Lords.

Filling the five viscera to nurture life, refining the countenance to transform the body, with resplendent blossoms like cloud-scattered fragments, golden powders and jade grains—these too can prolong years and extend lifespan, reaching ten thousand years.

Further categories include:
The nectar of Mysterious Water and Cloud Essence, the Five Yellows and Dark Spirits, the Central Essence and Dry Stones, □-grain and Multitudinous Greens, Vermilion Petals and White Chariots, the fruits of Flying Nodes, and Flowing Steeds of Purple Wood. Consuming these instantly grants one a lifespan of a thousand epochs. With each day’s ingestion, years extend; life advances with the medicine, shifting in tandem with its potency. These are the wondrous substances of boundless efficacy, the extraordinary formulas of immortality.

To attain a lifespan of a thousand epochs, one need only ingest a single dose.

**Celestial Immortal Medicinal Substances:**
Eastern Ying’s White Fragrance, Azure Coins of Canglang, Remnant Roots of High Mounds, Flying Fields of Accumulated Stones, Returning Cinnabar of the Great Void, Dark Firmness of Greater Qin, Flowing Light of Everlasting Grass, and Flying Stalks of Cloud Lads—these too enable one to ascend lightly, soaring beyond the corporeal to join the celestial perfected.

These are what celestial immortals consume, what flying spirits refine—unheard of by earthbound wanderers, unseen by mountain recluses.

One must further master the Nine Transformations and Ten Changes, the Eight Arts of Concealed Earth, only then can one roam the profound void, stride backward upon Heaven’s Edge, ride clouds and mount dragons, and ascend to soar through the heavens.

The fifth *zhi* is named White Branch Jade *Zhi*; consuming its core bestows the rank of Perfected Straightforward Censor of the Three Offices.

Consuming one stalk bestows the rank of Supreme Clarity Dragon-Tiger Immortal Lord, Rectifier of the Orthodox Unity.

It is also said: The fourth *zhi* is named Moonlight Cavern-Grass *Zhi*; its color is azure, its fruit pure white, the size of a plum, standing three to four feet tall, its leaves resembling cypress. At night, its fruit shines like moonlight illuminating an entire chamber. Each stalk bears nine fruits; when they fall to the ground, they swiftly grow to the size of a seven-inch mirror-disk, one or two inches thick upon the earth, glowing at night like the shifting gaze of an ox’s eye. One who consumes a single fruit is appointed Left Censor of the Supreme Clarity Immortal Offices.

**Grand Ultimate Medicinal Substances**
The next are the treasures of the Grand Ultimate:
Four Perfected Constant Jewels—namely, Nine-Stone Smelted Mist, Elixir-Liquid Jade Essence, Flowing Pearls of the Crown, Radiant Stone Quintessence, Golden Liquid of the Cinnabar Furnace, Purple Blossoms and Rainbow Petals.

The first *zhi* is named Dragon Immortal *Zhi*, resembling intertwined dragons bearing one another, its leaves as scales, its roots like a coiled dragon. Consuming it bestows the rank of Grand Ultimate Immortal Minister.

It is also said: The third *zhi* is named Ginseng-Perfected *Zhi*, crimson in color, with a vermilion glow like flickering flames. Striking its branches and leaves produces a sound like metal or stone; if broken, it instantly mends as before. Consuming it bestows the rank of Grand Ultimate Perfected.

Bend to pluck the Jade Essence of Orchid Garden; reach to gather the Purple □ of Round Mound;
White Water Spirit Clam, Eight Heavens’ Crimson ( ), Once-in-Ten-Thousand-Years, Flowing Radiance Nine Ranks.
Those who obtain and consume these transcend mortality after death.

These are what the Heavenly Thearch consumes, the treasures of the Supreme Lord—beyond the ken of Grand Ultimate, beyond the reach of Median Perfected.
Recite their stanzas, and the extraordinary stream may attain eternal life; intone their names, and one may dispel illness and sever demonic essences.

**Jade Clarity Medicinal Substances**
Sixfold Purity Flourishing Glory, Dark Radiance Eight Corners, Wind Fruit Cloud Seeds, Imperial Enclosure Jade Portal...

Those who obtain and consume these age beyond mortality.
These are what Jade Clarity consumes, what the Supreme Lord treasures—
by which one may ascend to soar the Scenic Empyrean, divide the dawn into myriad paths,
guard and stabilize the August Essence, infuse the Nine Brains at court.

Yet this Dao is most vast, its wondrous numen resplendent and remote—
not for those who feed on blood and flesh to fully comprehend.
But hearing the Mystic Tone scatters the turbid; listening to the wind’s qi dispels the foul.
Above, one may float beyond the Primal Simplicity; below, one may exorcise demons and dispel illness.

Fourth, An Duming, who first descended the Southern Perfected in the midst of Xiuwu County—these four are the Four Emperor Lords of the Golden Watchtower of the Great Ultimate. The Later Sage Li Lord, most revered on the left, has already ascended to the Highest Clarity, while the remaining three Emperors are the Heavenly Emperors of the Great Ultimate.

The aforementioned ninety-three individuals are the True Immortals of the Great Ultimate, some of whom have also advanced to the Highest Clarity.

The Overseer of Destinies, Eastern Minister Lord, said: "As for *shijie* (corpse liberation), it is the transformation of form, the refinement and shedding of original truth, the escape and change of bodily substance, the concealment and departure of the five constituents. Though it ranks as the lowest grade among immortal attainments, the endowment and reception it entails are by no means slight.

Some do not yet wish to ascend to heaven but prefer to dwell in renowned mountains; some seek to exalt the teachings of the world, severing the Way of life and death; some wish to cut off the close attachments of descendants, deeming the pursuit of divine transcendence rare and difficult; some desire to observe the transformations of the world for long ages, yet dread the toils of immortal office.

Once the wondrous Dao is fully attained, one may freely follow high or low paths as one pleases. It is not that one is incapable, but rather that one clarifies life and death to establish a fixed pattern—what is called ‘concealing the three luminaries’ and ‘the sun sinking into the land.’ Those who ‘fly the blossoms of langgan jade’ while tending to their graves include Master Gaoqiu, Master Yanmen, and Master Hongya.

Yet none knew that Master Gaoqiu, at that time, entered the Six Radiance Mountains through *shijie*, later ingested the water of golden liquid, and received the blossoms of langgan jade from the Central Mountain Master. Feigning death once more, he entered the Dark Continent, received scriptures, and became the Perfected of the Central Marchmount. Master Yanmen now resides in the Golden Court of the Great Cavern of Mount Meng, having received scriptures to become the Immortal Minister of the Middle Prime. Master Hongya is now the Perfected of Green City.

Those who ‘rinsed the dragon embryo in death’s resolve’ and ‘drank jade essence while knocking on coffins’ include my late master Wang Xicheng, as well as Zhao Boxuan and Liu Zixian. Those who ‘ingested golden elixir and announced their end’ include Zang Yanfu, Zhang Zifang, and Master Mo Di. Those who ‘clasped the ninefold cyclical elixir yet reeked of corpse stench’ and ‘swallowed the knife-point elixir only to have insects stream forth’ include Sima Jizhu, Lord Ning Zhong, King Yan Zhao, and Prince Wang Zijin.

King Mu of Zhou journeyed north to the slopes of Kunlun, personally drank the crimson marrow of Mount Jiang, and ate the fruit of the jade tree, yet was buried in Jiyin. Yu the Great visited Mount Zhong, tasted purple [elixir] and became drunk on golden wine, and practiced the Nine Perfected of the Numinous Treasure, yet still concealed himself in Kuaiji. The Great King of the Northern Rong, Changhu, presented Emperor Shun with ten transformations of white langgan frost and purple blossoms, which upon ingestion grant long life and flight as an immortal, rivaling heaven and earth. Shun ingested them yet feigned death and was buried in the wilds of Cangwu.

All these lords had already ‘ascended to the numinous river with dragon suites’ and ‘drummed the cloud pools with phoenixes,’ yet still employed *shijie* and feigned death. Their true intent was to sever the emotions of life and death, demonstrating to the people the limits of beginning and end. How could they be like those who rot in the dark yin of the earth, their flesh fed to ants and mole crickets?

Their aim was to obstruct those who defy the world and block the aspirations of the vulgar. As for Master Qingjing, Peng Keng, Feng Gang, the Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang, and the Eight Lords of Huainan, all had ingested the supreme elixir. Yet without taking even a single dose, they chose to withdraw in silence, secluding themselves in mountains and forests, delighting in roaming transformations and grieving over ascending the void. It was not that they could not ascend to heaven, but that they chose not to.

Thus, these lords wandered among the Five Marchmounts, changing their names and altering their appearances, no longer resorting to *shijie*. The Way of *shijie*, though somewhat wondrous, is rare and obstructed by emotions. Those who hear of it cannot attain it, and death is used to seal its path, showing there is no more to discuss. Even if Peng Keng roamed the mountains, Feng Gang frequented markets and courts, the Four Hoary Ones feigned old age, or the Eight Lords of Huainan transformed their forms myriad times, such things are not what I desire.

There are those who, by virtue of their names being inscribed on the Fangzhu register, are destined to become *shijie* immortals. Some are made so by their endowment, others by the decline of their aspirations and conduct, or by shallow and narrow learning, their inclinations stagnant and fixed. These are matters of rare attainment and individual allotment, not what was previously discussed. Lords like Master Yanmen and his peers, having already partaken of the supreme elixir, deliberately employed *shijie*.

In the past, I received from my late master the supreme methods of *shijie* and the arts of transformation by commission. Though I did not attain their use, I have always cherished them. Now, as the world’s dust and grime converge, armies clash fiercely, the Three Offices drive out the worthy and harm the Dao, those who speak of divine transcendence seek illness and pursue profit, and those who aspire to wealth and honor seek life through the Dao—why should one hasten amidst wind and fire, donning robes to enter the markets of Yan?

Now I secretly reveal the methods of *shijie*. Each may transmit them to disciples who are destined to become Perfected Ones. Employing them in concealment and flight can distance one from misfortune; applying them in departure can sever the close attachments of descendants; hiding and roaming can lead one to ascend renowned mountains.

If one’s Dao and arts are fully complete, myriad techniques perfectly clear, able to command a hundred ghosts, summon all spirits, sit and vanish, or disperse one’s form with a breath—though amidst armies, blades cannot harm; though traversing peril, calamities cannot touch; though entering markets and courts, no harm can arise—then one need not resort to the transformations of *shijie*.

Those who practice this liberation are mostly those not eager for the dragon chariot, content to dwell peacefully in mountains and forests. Take the *Lingwan* elixir, mix it with saliva, and apply it to the staff you hold. Sleep with it for three days, and the staff will transform into your likeness beneath the covers. Then depart quietly, and no one nearby will notice.

Apply the elixir to burning charcoal, and others will see your form burned to death—this is called *fire liberation*. Take one pill with water and drink it, then embrace grass and lie down. Others will see you wounded to death in an empty chamber—this is called *martial liberation*. In all cases, one may freely return to one’s hometown, but must change one’s name and alter one’s appearance."

In ancient times, one practitioner did this and entered Linlü Mountain, dwelling there for thirteen years before returning home. The supreme method of liberation is called *Matching the Purple Slip*, whereby the Three Offices no longer record one’s transgressions, sealing all gaps and falsely attributing death to the practitioner.

The *Lingwan* elixir may also be used to achieve *shijie* for others, provided one instructs them clearly on the timing and procedures of departure. If one wishes to bring a favored disciple along on their journey, this should be arranged accordingly. Those who achieve *shijie* through other elixirs, not by the transformation of the *Lingwan* pill, may not return to their hometown—for if they do, the Three Offices will seize them.

The methods of *shijie* vary: some die and then revive, some are decapitated yet emerge alive from elsewhere, some perish before burial and vanish without a trace, some retain their form but lose their bones, some leave their clothes behind while their form departs, and some shed their hair before their form disappears. Those who depart by daylight are called *upper shijie*; those who depart at midnight are called *lower shijie*; those who depart at dawn or dusk are called *Earthly Overseers*—though they achieve concealment, their traces remain, arousing suspicion. In this age, those whose aspirations are unfulfilled may not yet wander their hometowns, drifting without fixed abode, deeply entangled in doubt, their intentions lingering here.

If one’s ancestors have accrued merit in the Three Offices, its blessings may extend to descendants, allowing some to refine their transformations across generations, changing their surnames and rebirthing. This is the transmission of seven generations of hidden virtue, where roots and branches intertwine. Upon death, they must leave behind one bone to return to the Three Offices, while the rest of their bones ascend with their form. Men leave their left bone, women their right, and all receive scriptures to become Earthly Overseers. After two hundred and eighty years, they may advance to receive the Dao of Earthly Immortality.

On the day of their passing, if their form appears as flesh of the living, and at death their body remains fragrant and pure, their toes unblackened, their hands unwrinkled, this is called *naturally achieving shijie through prior virtue*.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of Concealed Radiance and the Record of Form and Spirit* from the *Dongzhen* canon

The *Four Epochs* states: The *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* (also called *The Flying Feather Scripture*)—those who possess it may achieve *shijie* by daylight.

The *Six Epochs* states: The *Numinous Book of Purple Texts* (also called *The Treasure Scripture of the Five Elders*)—those who possess it may achieve *shijie*.

—Excerpted from *The Jade Chapters of the Emperor* from the *Dongzhen* canon

For all Earthly Overseers who achieve *shijie*, according to the *True Regulations of the Four Poles*, after one hundred and forty years they may be appointed as Immortal Officials, and after another one thousand three hundred years, they may be appointed as Perfected Officials. Only then may they ascend on flying blossoms, ride a host of dragons, and roam the Nine Palaces of the Great Ultimate.

—Excerpted from *The Hidden Scripture of the Supreme* from the *Dongzhen* canon

Those who possess these scriptures yet fail to diligently cultivate, contemplate the true, and revere the numinous—indistinguishable from the common folk—may still preserve their hidden existence as Lesser Immortals and achieve *shijie* by daylight.

—Excerpted from *The Eight Simplicities of the True* from the *Dongzhen* canon

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate bequeathed a belt scattered with white powder. Consuming one *daogui* of it induces sudden heart pain as if pierced, and after three days of thirst, drinking a *hu* of liquid will sever the breath, leading to death. After burial, the corpse vanishes, leaving only clothes behind—this is the *Belt Liberation Immortal* of daylight. If one knows the name of the elixir, the heart pain ceases, but drinking a *hu* of liquid will still sever the breath. Upon severance, one awakens to find their discarded corpse on the earth. At that moment, jade maidens and jade lads arrive in a blue carriage to welcome them. Those who wish to pause must endure three days of heart pain, regulated by their drinking.

This method may be compounded and used by an entire household.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of True Traces*

The Grand Ultimate Golden Flower Perfected One inscribed this scripture upon the eastern wall of the Mystic Jade Hall within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Heavenly Emperor of the Great Tenuity. Its text reads:

The five qi arise from different directions,
Essence-light unites with form.
Some end in death,
Some begin in life.
The myriad kinds return to their root,
A thousand threads merge into darkness.
Qi drifts like floating mist,
Blood rushes as flowing clarity.
In a single dawn, the body takes shape—
Without the true, it cannot be complete.

Why not refine it with *yuncao* of dark purity,
Infuse it with *huili* of blossoming herbs,
Conjoin it with the five luminous, seven white numinous greens,
And harmonize it with the white essence of soaring dragons?

Bathe at dawn’s first light,
Compose the mind and face the east.
Concentrate the essence, rouse the soul—
Before the Five Lords of the Supreme Emperor,
Bow twice and pay homage to the numinous.
Secure the five directions,
Prolong life between heaven and earth,
Enter and circulate freely,
Each resting in its proper place,
Flourishing the five viscera.

This text is the Great Script of Intertwining Dragons from the Eight Assemblies of the Highest Clarity—
Not something worldly scholars can comprehend.

The Grand Simplicity Perfected One, having distinguished and transcribed its characters,
Received and ingested it,
Seeking its explication from the Grand Ultimate Heavenly Lord.

*Yuncao of dark waves* is *heiju* vine, also called *xuanqing*.
*Huili of blossoming herbs* is honey.
*The five luminous, seven white numinous greens* are *xie* greens.
*The white essence of soaring dragons* is quartz.

The method requires cultivating *xie* greens,
Leaving them unharvested on the fifth day of the fifth month,
Only tending and nurturing them with the hoe.
After five years,
They may be gathered as medicine,
Called *the five luminous, seven white numinous greens*.
Select ten pounds of the finest, deep-blue, plump *xie* greens,
Five *dou* of *heiju* vine,
Five *dou* of honey as congealed snow,
Thirty-six *hu* of pristine water from the stone cavities of lofty mountains and dark cliffs,
And five pieces of pure white quartz, free of grit and flaws.
First, grind them well on a whetstone,
Shaping them into perfect spheres like small sparrow’s eggs,
Polishing them to a pearl-like luster,
Ensuring no trace of grit remains.

Begin a purification fast of one hundred and sixty days,
Completing it on the ninth day of the first month.
Then, construct a foundation of earth two *chi* high,
Build a furnace-house,
And within it, a proper furnace,
With the cauldron’s mouth facing west—
The house should also have a western door.
Obtain a new iron cauldron and place it upon the furnace.
On the ninth day of the ninth month, at the *shen* and *you* hours,
Kneel facing the cauldron’s mouth, toward the east,
And place the five stone pellets into the cauldron.
First, cast one pellet into the cauldron and invoke:

Stone of the Azure Emperor,
Three Pristine Primordial Lords,
Great One Who Oversees Destiny,
Dark Mother Who Governs the Soul,
Fortify the bones, replenish the liver,
Guard and nourish the liver spirit,
Let the liver flourish above,
That the liver may endure forever.

Next, cast another pellet into the cauldron and recite:

Stone of the White Emperor,
Where the Great One rests,
Primordial Father Who Governs essence,
Dark Mother Who Replenishes the lungs,
Guard and nourish the lung spirit,
Let it know no decay,
Let the lungs flourish above,
For ten thousand myriad ages.

Next, cast another pellet into the cauldron and invoke:

Stone of the Vermilion Emperor,
In harmony with the Heavenly Lord’s voice,
Dark Mother Who Governs the blood,
Peach Vitality Who Replenishes the heart,
Guard and nourish the heart spirit,
Let it know no ashen sinking,
Let the heart flourish above,
Becoming a forest of jade.

Next, cast another pellet into the cauldron and recite:

Stone of the Black Emperor,
In accord with the Great One’s calculations,
Dark Mother and Primordial Father,
Who govern the transformation of fluids,
Guard and nourish the kidney spirit,
Let it know no ruin or chaos,
Let the kidneys flourish above,
Ever attaining the highest aspiration.

Next, cast the final pellet into the cauldron and invoke:

Stone of the Yellow Emperor,
In shared majesty with the Venerable Lord,
Great One and Heavenly Lord Who Governs the po and secures the spleen,
Guard and nourish the spleen spirit,
Let it know no collapse,
Let the spleen flourish above,
Ascending at dawn’s light.

When casting the stones, hold the breath for five cycles before each placement.
Once all are cast, rise and face the furnace,
Bowing twice five times.
Then take five pounds of *xie* whites,
Carefully layering them over the five stones.
Afterward, pour honey to cover the *xie*.
Then, add five *dou* of *jujiao* to cover the honey.
Next, measure the depth to which the *jujiao* fills the cauldron.
Gradually add clear water, leaving the cauldron slightly unfilled,
Covering it loosely with a wooden lid.
At dawn on the tenth day of the ninth month, kindle the fire,
Using straight-grained, well-dried firewood,
Avoiding worm-eaten or bark-stripped, impure fuel.
Let the fire simmer gently,
Preventing violent boiling or overflow.
Frequently tend the fire,
Adjusting its intensity below.
First, observe the level of the rich decoction;
When the water reduces, replenish it as needed,
Using all thirty-six *hu* of water.
After the water is spent,
Continue simmering until the decoction reduces by two *cun* from its original level,
Judging by sight.
When complete, let it cool in the cauldron,
Remove the fire and ashes,
Seal the cauldron tightly,
And after five days, gently retrieve the five stones.
At dawn, face the five directions and bow twice each.
Then, kneeling, take this rich decoction,
Mixing it with east-flowing water,
And consume it in sequence.
When drinking the water and decoction,
Let the stone pellets follow into the mouth and down the throat.
While ingesting, recite the invocations as when first casting the stones into the cauldron.
Afterward, bow twice five times again.

If, upon completion of the decoction, no stones remain,
There is no cause for alarm—
The five essences have dissolved and concealed their numinous forms,
Merging into the cloud-like richness,
Leaving no trace.
Simply consume five *ge* daily,
Washing it down with clear wine.
The spirit transforms, the body reverts,
Each securing and nourishing the five viscera.
Within the five viscera,
The five stones are regenerated anew.

Beware of fierce fire—
If the fire is too strong, the stone essence will flee,
The dregs will spoil and rot,
The cloud-like richness will scorch and reek,
Rendering it unfit for consumption.
Moreover, the flavor of this cloud-like richness is
Fragrant, sweet, and surpassingly fine,
Strengthening the blood, replenishing the essence,
Filling and generating the five viscera,
Securing the qi, congealing the fluids,
Prolonging and nourishing the hun and po—
A true supreme medicine.

Store it in a fine vessel, sealing it tightly. Begin by consuming two *ge* daily, maintaining this regimen without fail. If the cloud-like richness or honeyed decoction proves too potent, it may be extracted first, with the stone medicine taken afterward, then recombined and simmered until it congeals like sliced fat. Some choose to form it into pills, taking thirty daily, though the richness is far superior to pill form. The method may be adapted to personal preference, for what suits the body brings ease, and what brings ease is without flaw.

Those who regularly consume this richness will find it most excellent. Once the initial supply is exhausted, prepare another batch as before: place five *liang* of white quartz at the bottom of the cauldron, adding one *liang* at a time while reciting the prescribed incantations. Unlike before, the stones need not be ground but should be rounded for easier ingestion. Once the medicine is complete, remove the stones and cast them into an eastward-flowing stream, avoiding stagnant or parched pools. If one chooses not to prepare another batch, the previous five stones remain undiminished.

This richness is called *Mysterious Water Jade Liquid*, also known as *Flying Dragon Cloud-Richness* or *Refined Essence of the Five Stones*. After fifteen years of consumption, the body will radiate a jade-like luminosity, becoming inwardly and outwardly translucent. One will attain longevity matching heaven and earth, command ghosts and spirits, and after three years, gain the ability to read by night. The True One says: "This formula surpasses the refinement of eight stones or the ingestion of gold, and far excels the jade nectar of cassia water and mica."

Upon consuming these five stones, they descend into the throat and directly fill the five viscera. The viscera perpetually generate their essence, each housing one stone to guard its apertures. Above these apertures bloom five-colored flowers. Should one temporarily die and pass through the Great Yin, enduring the trials of the Three Bureaus—where flesh turns to ash, blood sinks, and pulses scatter—the five viscera will yet regenerate. The white bones will gleam like jade, the seven *po* will tend the remains, the three *hun* will guard the dwelling, the Three Primes will rejoice in rest, the Great Spirit will seal within, the Great One will record the spirit, and the Controller of Destinies will hold the tally. The Five Elders will uphold their splendor, and the Imperial Lord will treasure the essence. After thirty, twenty, ten, or five years—emerging at will—the time of rebirth arrives: blood is recollected, flesh nurtured, fluids generated, and the form reconstituted, its refined appearance surpassing even its pre-death state. This is what the True One means by "refining the body in the Great Yin and transforming the countenance before the Three Bureaus."

The Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity intoned:
*"Refining the body in the Great Yin,
Outshines the nine-fold cinnabar elixir.
A radiant visage, dignified and stern,
A countenance suffused with numinous light.
The five stones unite with celestial perfection,
The Great One treasures the spirit’s gate.
Ascending the Terrace of the Great Ultimate,
One receives the scriptures and becomes an immortal."*

The True Man of the Southern Marchmount, Red Pine Master, said: "Long ago, there was a man named Zhao Chengzi, a student of immortality. He first received my *Upper Scripture on Filling and Nurturing the Five Viscera* and followed its instructions. Later, Chengzi deliberately sought to enter the Great Yin to transform his appearance and alter his form. At that time, he feigned death in a stone chamber beneath the Dark Mound Mountain in Shanggu of Youzhou, becoming a corpse of white bones. Five or six years later, a traveler passing through the mountains discovered his remains in the stone chamber—flesh decayed, bones intact. Yet within, the five viscera remained self-generated, fragrant and uncorrupted as before, wrapped in fluids and blood, with five-colored flowers gleaming within and a purple placenta entwining without.

The traveler sighed, saying: 'I have heard that the viscera can be nurtured to endure without decay—now I see such a man! This one must have possessed the Dao but failed to complete it.' He pried open the corpse and found within each viscus a white stone. 'What preserves your viscera must be these five stones,' he said. 'You have lost the Dao; I shall take them for myself.' He extracted the stones and swallowed them whole. The stones descended into his throat.

Ten years later, as Chengzi’s corpse was about to revive, the traveler—having already consumed the stones—found them flying from his mouth like cicadas, returning to the corpse’s viscera. Thereupon, Chengzi transformed and rose. Witnessing the stones take flight, the traveler trembled in awe. Days later, he returned to the mountain to seek the corpse’s resting place. Arriving at the stone chamber, he saw Chengzi, hair unbound and reclining, whistling through the numinous valley, his face radiating jade-like light, his hair lustrous and flowing. Overcome, the traveler prostrated himself among the rocks and bamboo.

Chengzi asked: 'Who are you?' Suddenly, five elderly immortals appeared before Chengzi, clad in embroidered robes and talismanic sashes, holding feathered tablets, crowned in purple, treading upon the void. Gnashing their teeth, they addressed Chengzi: 'The one who stole and swallowed your viscera’s precious stones is this leprous-faced man before you.' At their words, the traveler’s face erupted in foul sores, his speech failed, and he fled in disarray. Upon reaching home, his entire household was afflicted with leprosy, and all perished together, their clan extinguished.

When a perfected one temporarily journeys through the Great Yin, the Great One guards the corpse, the three *hun* tend the bones, the seven *po* protect the flesh, and the embryonic spirit records the qi. It is not that they wish to conceal evil intentions or blind the eyes and ears of the wicked and foolish, but rather to manifest numinous proofs across the eight directions and display true majesty in resplendent glory. How much more so when one harbors the divine stones of the Five Emperors and the essence of the Numinous Lords? To steal and consume them in hopes of prolonging life or secretly seeking immortality is beyond hope—how could it be otherwise?

Thus, the True Man of the Southern Marchmount recorded this tale to dispel the reckless greed of thieves."

**On the Transformation of Form**

Laozi said: When a serpent obtains the Numinous Treasure, it transforms into a divine dragon; when a crow obtains it, it becomes a phoenix; when a common beast obtains it, it turns into a qilin; when an ordinary person obtains it, they are called a sage.

What is a sage? One who possesses the scripture of the Perfected Communion with the Sacred, and who constantly ingests it, may wander and sport upon the Five Marchmounts, roam freely through the void, alter the five viscera, and transform their form and appearance. In one year, their qi is renewed; in two years, their blood; in three years, their flesh; in four years, their sinews; in five years, their bones; in six years, their marrow; in seven years, their hair; in eight years, their locks; in nine years, their very form—body and substance entirely transformed. Thus is the Great Dao perfected.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of the Five Natural Designations from the Cavern of Mystery*

The Divine Lord of the Great One gives birth to the five viscera, fills the six stomachs, nourishes the nine orifices, harmonizes the nine passes, refines the three hun-souls, illumines the two youths, preserves the body, and grants longevity of ten thousand years. Here follows the formula for the Four-Filling Pellets.

**Four-Filling Pellets Formula**

*Taiyi Yu Yu Root*, four liang: stabilizes the six palaces and fills the five viscera.
*True Tangkuei*, one liang: harmonizes with the Yu Yu Root to halt the onset of the hundred diseases.
*Frankincense*, one liang: blends with Tangkuei to fumigate the five viscera within.
*Ginseng*, one liang: supplements the fluids of the six palaces and aids the potency of the Yu Yu Root.
*Clove*, one liang: dispels guest heat in the stomach and arrests phlegm congestion.

The above five ingredients take the Yu Yu Root as their chief, with the other four following it. First, place the chief ingredient in the mortar and pound it a hundred times, then add the remaining four and grind them into powder.

*Cinnabar*, four liang: gathers the hun and po souls, fills the three spirits, and regulates harmonious qi.
*Licorice*, one liang: harmonizes with cinnabar, benefits the flesh, and removes white hair.
*Costus Root*, one liang: assists licorice in expelling the three worms and hidden corpses.
*Dried Rehmannia*, one liang: harmonizes the hundred marrows and fills the brain with blood.
*Rosewood*, one liang: brightens the pupils of the eyes and fumigates the lower passes.

The above five ingredients take cinnabar as their chief, with the other four following it. First, place the chief ingredient in the mortar and pound it a hundred times, then add the remaining four and grind them all into powder.

*Poria*, four liang: fills the seven orifices, supplements the nine deficiencies, and harmonizes the numinous passes.
*Wood* [ingredient unclear], one liang: harmonizes with poria, enhances spirit and qi, and brightens the pupils of the eyes.
*Dried Ginger*, one liang: supplements the potency of the wood, dispels phlegm-heat, opens the three passes, and removes cold.
*Ledebouriella*, one liang: supplements numbness and impediment, dispels foul fluids, and arrests hunger and thirst.
*Mica Powder*, one liang: moistens the form and body, generates luster in the face, and supplements bone and blood.

The above five ingredients take poria as their chief, with the other four following it. First, place the chief ingredient in the mortar and pound it a hundred times, then add the remaining four and grind them all into powder.

*Ophiopogon*, four liang (remove the heart): fills the spirit-essence, nourishes the numinous fluids, and secures the bones.
*Dried Jujube Paste*, one liang: assists ophiopogon, congeals the blood vessels, and removes heart impurities.
*Aconite*, one liang (stir-fried): benefits the qi of the brain, fills cold within the viscera, and dispels phlegm.
*Sesame*, one liang (stir-fried): harmonizes the fluids of the throat and mouth, fills leakage in the lower passes, and moistens the three spirits.
*Dragon Bone*, one liang: benefits the six fluids, nourishes the orifices and intestines, blackens the hair, and halts whitening.

The above five ingredients take ophiopogon as their chief, with the other four following it. First, place the chief ingredient in the mortar and pound it a hundred times, then add the remaining four and grind them all into powder.

In total, the Four-Filling Spirit Pellets comprise twenty ingredients, divided into five groups, each ground into powder. First, place the Yu Yu Root group in the mortar and pound it three thousand times; next, add the cinnabar group and pound it four thousand times; then add the poria group and pound it five thousand times; next, add the ophiopogon group and pound it six thousand times. Then add four sheng of white honey and pound it seven thousand times; next, add twelve liang of white wax and pound it eight thousand times. Add more honey until the mixture can be formed into pills—if the mixture is too firm, add honey; if it is soft, no further addition is needed. Add more honey and continue pounding up to thirty thousand times. When the medicine is complete, form it into pills the size of a chicken’s egg yolk, or calculate the yolk’s size to make smaller pills for ingestion.

Take the first day of the first and ninth months, when the stellar configurations are aligned, to compound the medicine. Begin ingestion on the full moon and continue for a hundred days. At the middle hour, measure and take five pills. On the preceding day, fast; on the following day at dawn, ingest the pills. Afterward, resume eating and drinking as usual. After a thousand days, take seven pills within two hundred days. After two thousand days, take twenty-nine pills within three hundred days. After three thousand days, take thirty-nine pills within four hundred days. This is the established measure. The spirit fills and guards the center, and one’s destiny becomes coextensive with Heaven and Earth. This medicine does not decay for ten thousand years. If one constantly ingests this medicine, one need never again consume any other miscellaneous food or elixirs.

Before compounding the medicine, observe abstinence for seven days, forever renouncing the bedchamber. Do not allow chickens, dogs, children, or women to see it. When compounding the medicine, burn incense and set a divine seat facing east for the Divine Lord of the Great One, the Lord of the Great One, and the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Great One. Constantly maintain reverent visualization and invocation. When ingesting the medicine, likewise visualize and face the Moon King. This is what is called the Four Great Ones, which fill the four spirits and cure the hundred diseases. It enables one to perceive without turning one’s gaze ten thousand *li* away, restores blackness to white hair, regrows fallen teeth, and makes the face and eyes radiant while the skin and texture generate luster. After one year of ingestion, all long-standing illnesses are dispelled; in two years, the hair turns black; in three years, the qi is renewed; in four years, the vessels are renewed; in five years, the [text unclear] is renewed; in six years, the sinews are renewed; in seven years, the bones are renewed; in eight years, the teeth are renewed; in nine years, the form and body are renewed. In ten years, one commands ghosts and spirits and wields authority over tigers and wolves.

**On Longevity**

The Heavenly Worthy accomplished the five directional lands and delivered all people. At that time, he returned to the Palace of Eternal Joy, where from all the various lands—great and small—people came in throngs, an entire nation’s worth, beyond any means to restrain them. The Heavenly Worthy then closed his three eyes for three nights, obscuring the celestial radiance so that no light shone. He gathered firewood upon a high mound some two hundred *zhang* in height. The Heavenly Worthy sat atop the pyre and set himself ablaze. The flames blazed, illuminating the four directions with brilliance. The men and women of the lands, seeing from afar the Heavenly Worthy seated within the fire, could find no way to approach and could only bare their hearts from afar. The Heavenly Worthy, wishing to observe their sincerity, addressed those who had come: “If you desire long life, you must enter the fire and receive the Dharma from me.” Those truly devoted and yearning for the Great Dharma numbered seventy-two thousand four hundred and fifty; they cast themselves into the flames and all reached the presence of the Dao. The Heavenly Worthy then bestowed upon them the scriptures and methods within the fire, conferring them as each entered. Their bodies all attained deliverance, and they departed in transformed form. The remainder, numbering three hundred thousand, seeing from afar that those who entered did not emerge, believed them to have perished in the flames. Thereupon, they withdrew and returned to their homelands. Those who had entered the fire to receive deliverance arrived home first, while those who had not entered arrived later. Upon reuniting, they lamented and sighed with regret, their remorse beyond remedy. Those whose bodies had received deliverance all attained long life.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of the Numinous Writings of the Cavern Mystery*

The Dao declares: All received the boundless, supreme deliverance of the Primordial Beginning in the Great Floating Li Land within the Azure Heavens of the Beginning, where the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded this scripture. He circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, then ascended his seat. Heavenly Perfected Spirits, lofty sages, and perfected ones of wondrous practice—innumerable hosts—descended from the void, riding vermilion clouds through the cinnabar firmament, their jade wheels and green chariots shaded by feathered canopies. Jade light streamed forth in five resplendent hues, suffusing the Great Void with radiance for seven days and seven nights. The sun, moon, and stars of the celestial realms, along with the jade mechanisms of the heavens, halted their revolutions. Divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds, the heavens were free of drifting veils, and the four *qi* shone clear. Throughout the land, mountains, rivers, forests, and groves leveled to uniformity, no longer high or low, the earth transformed into azure jade, devoid of any other hue. The assembled perfected ones attended the seat as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy floated upon a dark throne above five-colored lions. After the first recitation of the scripture, the great sages of the heavens simultaneously proclaimed its excellence, and all the deaf and ailing in the land regained their hearing. After the second recitation, the blind regained their sight. After the third, the mute could speak. After the fourth, the lame and those afflicted with chronic ailments could all rise and walk. After the fifth, those suffering from long-standing, intractable illnesses regained their forms. After the sixth, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. After the seventh, the old reverted to youth, and the young grew strong. After the eighth, pregnant women and creatures—whether their offspring were born or unborn—all saw their young brought to completion. After the ninth, the earth’s treasuries were revealed, and gold and jade emerged. After the tenth, withered bones revived, all rising as living beings. At that time, every man and woman in the land turned their hearts wholly toward the Dao, all received its protection and deliverance, and together attained long life.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern Mystery Scripture of Boundless Deliverance*

The cloud-nectar is called Mystic Water Jade Liquid, also known as Flying Dragon Cloud-Nectar or the Refined Essence of the Five Stones. Ingesting it for fifteen years, the body emits jade-like radiance, transparent within and without, and one attains long life coeval with heaven and earth.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern Perfection Scripture on Filling and Nourishing the Five Viscera*

The Daoist who charts the course of life does so not for the sake of fame.

The raiment tattered, the sandals worn—yet no longing for honor or glory.
The heart immaculate and white, the mind free from partiality.
The will flows like water, dwelling amid the city’s throng.
Accumulating and abiding in non-action, only then can one attain long life.

—Excerpted from *The Scripture of Wondrous Perfection*

In governing people and serving heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one return early.
Early return is called the repeated accumulation of virtue.
With virtue amassed, there is nothing one cannot overcome.
Having nothing one cannot overcome, none can fathom its limit—
and with this, one may possess the state.
Possessing the state’s foundational power,
one may endure long.
This is called deep roots and firm stem,
the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

—Excerpted from *The Virtue Scripture of Laozi*

The Lady of Purple Tenuity addressed the Divine Mother, saying:
At dawn, ingest the qi of the sun;
at midnight, gather the essence of the moon.
Visualize it nine inches before your face,
letting its radiance illuminate the Mud-Pill Palace,
descending to the five viscera,
permeating the entire form.
Draw the qi into the mouth,
its luminous hue resplendent and bright—
after a long while, the practice is complete.
By this constant practice, one attains long life.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern Perfection Scripture of the Great One, the Celestial Lord, and the Grand Elixir of Myriad Writings*

The Perfected One said:
To consume the essence of the sun is to surely attain long life.
Thereby ascending to heaven to pay homage to the Primordial Lord,
always on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the lunar month,
from sunrise to noon, ingest it.
First visualize the sun within the heart,
with a dark canopy within the sun,
and beneath the canopy, a youth.
The upright qi pervades the body,
ninefold within and without.
Envision crimson qi filling the head,
rising from the crown to ascend to heaven,
circling the sun ninefold.
Recite the incantation:
*"Sun Lord, Primordial Yang,
return to the Crimson Palace,
unite with my virtue,
together nourishing the youth."*
Then visualize the solar essence descending
into the nostrils and mouth,
swallowing it twenty-seven times until the heart is full.
Within the heart are three figures:
to the left, the Father of the Great One;
to the right, the Mother of the Mysterious Origin;
and at the center, the Crimson Child.
Seated upon a golden bed and jade couch,
holding jade ladles and jade cups,
they drink the divine wine of jade blossoms
and the celestial zhi herbs,
partaking in this feast—
thus never hungering or thirsting, attaining long life.

To consume the essence of the moon is to attain long life,
thereby ascending to heaven.
Always on the fifteenth night at midnight,
face the moon and bow twice.
Recite the incantation:
*"Moon Lord, Radiant Child,
return to the Cinnabar Field,
unite with my virtue,
together nourishing the youth."*
Then visualize the white qi of the moon and the yellow essence descending
into the nostrils and mouth,
swallowing it twenty-one times before ceasing.
The lunar essence anchors in the root of the kidneys,
and one attains long life.

To consume the essence of the stars is to ascend to the Great Clarity.
Always at sunrise, dusk, noon, and midnight,
visualize the Great Yellow Star of the Northern Culmen.
Recite the incantation:
*"August Heavenly Thearch,
Supreme Dao Lord,
your humble descendant, so-and-so,
loves the Dao of immortality
and wishes to attain long life.
Thus, I visualize the stellar essence descending
between my brows,
flowing into my nostrils and mouth.
I swallow it fifteen times,
envisioning the qi filling my heart, gallbladder, and spleen.
The Dao Mother presides, nursing the Crimson Child—
thus never hungering or thirsting, attaining long life."*

—Excerpted from *The Cavern Mystery Scripture of the Five Talismans*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said:
Accomplishing three hundred acts of goodness,
one may attain long life as an earthbound immortal.
If even one act remains incomplete,
one must begin anew,
and all previous merits are lost.
Only by constantly holding this intention in mind and body
can it be so.
To guide others in doing good is itself a meritorious act.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern Mystery Scripture on Stabilizing the Will*

The Dao declares:
The lesser adept cultivates the body by severing passions and restraining desire;
adorns the spirit through plain attire and frugal nourishment,
rejecting glory and splendor;
dwells in secluded groves, loving mountains and delighting in waters;
indulges in the serenity of the true, abiding in simplicity and steadfastness;
abstains from grains and ceases eating,
maintaining long fasts and contemplating the Dao;
after noon, takes no food,
sitting upright in the presence of the master’s sacred treasures.
In going out and coming in, one mingles with birds and beasts;
a solitary traveler in rocky caves,
alone amid the empty mountains.
Thoughts do not yearn for home,
sorrow does not grieve the body.
Roaming the forests and ravines,
the spirit is joyful as if feasting.
Though the face bears the look of hunger,
the heart holds a cinnabar elixir.
Enduring hardships with equanimity,
the countenance remains serene.
Facing trials without fear,
the heart is tranquil and reverent.
Through such conduct,
one moves the Sovereign of the Void.
Nine deaths are extinguished, nine lives are preserved—
unwavering in resolve, holding fast with extraordinary firmness,
one succeeds in transformation:
riding the void to soar,
roaming and feasting upon the Five Peaks.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern Mystery Scripture of the Dharma Wheel*

To traverse the great kalpa and transcend calamity, preserving the precious life:
The essence of the Nine Mysteries of the Primordial Beginning,
passing through the Nine Conjunctions of the Great Yang,
when the floodwaters surge to the heavens—
inscribe in green on white silk and wear it upon the head,
floating upon the clear waves.
Disaster cannot harm you, and the body is preserved for long life.
Wearing for a long time the talisman of the immortal’s "Small Kalpa Transcending Calamity, Preserving the Precious Life,"
and the Nine Heavens’ Talisman of the Great Perfected,
passing through the cycles of the Small Yang’s Nine Conjunctions,
when water and fire cross paths and myriad disasters arise—
inscribe in vermilion on white silk and wear it upon the left elbow.
Entering the abyss, you will not sink;
entering fire, you will not burn.
No harm can assail you,
the body is preserved for long life,
and you attain a lifespan coeval with heaven.
Wear it long, O immortal.

The Great Characters of the Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign
all possess the wondrous methods of pure emptiness

none may know or hear of them.
Those who possess these texts become earthbound immortals.

From the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Cavern Realms’ Transformations*

The Heavenly Worthy said:
If good men and good women can arouse the natural intention of the Dao,
enter the Dharma gate,
receive my Ten Precepts,
and practice the Twelve Permissible Deeds,
they shall become the pure and faithful disciples of the Great Dao.
The pure and faithful disciples shall equal the merit of the Brave Flying Devas.
The Flying Devas are those who have not yet attained the Dao;
they are the ten-times-turned disciples of the Dao,
flying through the empty void,
serving as the pure and faithful charioteers of the various heavens.
While still in the world,
disciples may be freed from sorrow and distress,
delivered from manifold sufferings;
their bodies enter radiance,
their forms within become clear and upright,
summoning ghosts and commanding spirits,
subduing demonic essences.
After ten turns, they may ascend to become Flying Devas.
If, within a single turn, they practice with diligence,
their hearts unwavering and unretreatant,
performing all meritorious deeds,
maintaining strict fasting and austerities,
unwearied from dawn to dusk,
they shall equal the merit of the Flying Devas.

The Heavenly Worthy said:
Those who uphold the Six Precepts
all possess the wisdom of the Six Penetrations,
able to bestow their virtue,
their conduct aligning with the natural.
Blessings and felicity ever abide with them,
their bodies ever distant from calamity and harm,
their households’ treasures and delights unceasing.
Through lifetimes of karmic conditions,
after one turn they receive their reward,
equaling the merit of the Flying Devas,
transcending the nine turns of the wheel,
attaining the rank of the Great Dao.
The names of the ten-times-turned disciples are inscribed throughout the heavens,
and their seven ancestors together ascend to be reborn in the heavenly halls.

The Heavenly Worthy said:
As for the Ten Wholesome Exhortations and Precepts,
none but the ten-times-turned disciples of the Great Dao can practice them,
equaling the merit of the Flying Devas.
Their hearts merge with the wisdom of the Six Penetrations,
penetrating the empty and non-substantial.
After death, they all attain flight amidst the clouds,
with the host of sages as their charioteers,
roaming the ten directions.

From the *Scripture of the Cavern Mystery’s Great Precepts*

The *Luminous Perfected Regulations* states:
Those who cultivate and uphold the wisdom of the Upper Grade’s Ten Precepts,
accumulate manifold good deeds,
make offerings to Dharma masters,
burn incense and light lamps,
assisting the radiance of Heaven,
illuminating the ten directions,
bestowing kindness and spreading virtue,
mindful of delivering sentient beings—
after death, they ascend to the Eastern Florescence,
receiving the title of Flying Deva,
their rank equal to the ten-times-turned disciples of the Most High,
serving as the charioteers of the host of sages,
roaming amidst the clouds.

It further states:
Reverently uphold the Ten Precepts,
burn incense and keep lamps ever bright.
When merit is fulfilled after ten turns,
their reward and rank shall attain the Flying Devas.

From the *Scripture of the Cavern Realms’ Luminous Perfected*

**Chapter on Ascending the Moon’s Courtyard**

For those who seek the Dao of gathering the moon’s yellow essence,
on the day when the moon approaches the Eastern Well,
at dawn take a jar of well-flower water,
expose it in the central courtyard,
and at midnight inscribe the Yang Essence Jade Womb Refined Immortal Talisman,
placing it in the water.
Face east, knock the teeth twenty-four times,
and recite the incantation over the water:

*Yellow qi, Yin essence,*
*Yang spirit, cavern-bright.*
*Bathe the nine souls,*
*adorn with the golden dawn.*
*Round and luminous, I declare,*
*jade womb refines the immortal.*
*Flowering radiance intermingles,*
*flowing fragrance steeps the ford.*
*Nine Yangs transform as one,*
*mysterious rosy clouds disperse the mist.*
*Primal effulgence returns the numinous,*
*curved reflections adorn my form.*
*Ascend in flight to the Upper Palace,*
*gaze upon the cavern’s jasper eaves.*

When finished, take a *dou* of the water,
face the moon, and ingest it.
Then clench the fists and visualize the five-colored flowing essence of the moon,
all coming to crown and connect with the body.
Within the five colors, there is also the moon’s yellow qi,
large as the pupil of the eye,
layered in dozens,
within the moon’s essence of five colors,
all entering through the mouth,
pervading the five viscera.
Then face the moon and swallow the essence fifty times,
swallowing the saliva ten times.
Knock the teeth ten times and softly recite the incantation:

*Yellow qi flows essence,*
*threefold congeals the radiance.*
*Mysterious splendor returns to uprightness,*
*adorned with the eight rays’ brilliance.*
*Refine the soul at the Eastern Well,*
*receive the luminous flying sovereign.*
*Golden efflorescence scatters the numinous,*
*the Five Lords diffuse fragrance.*
*The Lady descends sweet wine,*
*moistening and sprinkling the ten directions.*
*Vast mushrooms pour downward,*
*the six palaces overflow and fill.*
*Golden essence transforms ninefold,*
*exchanging scenes, returning countenance.*
*Riding the void, descending mist,*
*roaming and feasting in the great emptiness.*
*Ascend to the moon’s courtyard,*
*equal in pair with the Perfected.*
*Transforming through the eight paths,*
*exiting existence, entering non-existence.*
*Three dawns’ cavern radiance,*
*eternally preserved without end.*

When finished, bathe with the remaining water,
return to the chamber facing east,
and ingest the Yang Essence Jade Womb Refined Immortal Talisman.
Knock the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:

*Concealing Heaven’s colored radiance,*
*yellow qi thickly disperses.*
*Congealing essence, condensing splendor,*
*eight rays brightly shine.*
*Polishing and adorning the yellow efflorescence,*
*stone scenes steep and irrigate.*
*Jade mushrooms overflow and fill,*
*moistening and filling the great Han.*
*All under Heaven receives refinement,*
*dawn’s luminous morning begins.*
*Driving the scene, ascending the void,*
*attaining flight to the imperial palace.*
*The Eternal Separation descends to the world,*
*transcending the eight difficulties.*
*Equal in radiance with the sun,*
*one in stem with the moon.*

When finished, swallow the qi fifty times and stop.

This is the Dao of ingesting the moon’s essence,
the wondrous Dharma of the Primordial Beginning.
Practicing it for one year, the face takes on a jade-like luster;
after seven years, the numinous descends,
the body emits golden light;
after nine years, one flies aloft,
ascending to the moon’s homeland.

The Yin Essence Flying Scene Jade Talisman
is inscribed in yellow on bamboo membrane on the day of the Great Year Star,
and ingested facing the Great Year Star.

The above is from the *Eight Essences of the Cavernous Perfection Scripture*.

The Sun’s Soul Refining Essence Yin Talisman is inscribed in qi on blue paper at midnight on the Winter Solstice, then cast into water to bathe the entire body, refining both blood and essence. It draws the sun’s essence into the Purple Radiance, descends flying blossoms upon the Eight Celestial Steeds, refines the five palaces in the Jade Pool, and transports the adept’s body to the Broad Cold. Additionally, inscribe in black on blue silk and wear it on the body. After eight years, the body emits golden light, a circular brilliance appears at the nape, and perfected beings descend to bestow the adept with true scriptures, enabling flight through the Great Void and ascent to the Broad Cold Palace.

The above is from the *Cavernous Perfection Scripture of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence*.

**Ascending the Sun Gate Section**

The Flying Blossom Sun Radiance Jade Embryo Numinous Talisman is inscribed in vermilion on bamboo membrane on one’s natal day and ingested facing that day. After three years, flowing essence and purple light illuminate the body’s form, and the face takes on a golden countenance. After nine years, one soars through the Great Void and ascends to the Sun Gate.

Additionally, inscribe in cinnabar on yellow silk and wear it on the body. After eight years, perfected beings descend to bestow the adept with true scriptures, enabling flight through the Empty Mystery and ascent to the Cavernous Yang Palace.

The Dragon Radiance Nine Refining Talisman is inscribed in blue on white paper at the *bu* hour on the Beginning of Autumn and cast into water; bathing in it refines the bones and marrow, summoning the mysterious radiance of the Purple Radiance, drawing yang essence into the Flying Root, gathering yellow qi into the Water Mother, and descending perfected beings to the Purple Pavilion. Additionally, inscribe in blue on white silk and wear it on the body. After eight years, a solar orb of light appears above the head, enabling flight through the Great Void and ascent to the Hall of Broad Numinosity.

The Dao of seeking immortality: On the Summer Solstice at midnight, enter a chamber, lie or sit facing south, close the eyes at will, and inwardly visualize the Lady of the Moon’s Cinnabar Radiance, whose surname and given name are [to be filled in], standing eight inches and eight fen tall. She wears her hair in a cloud-like topknot, dons a cinnabar brocade flying skirt, and holds moonbeams in her mouth, which descend into the adept’s Crimson Palace within the heart. Soon, the moonbeams scatter into yellow qi, raining down upon the adept’s form. The Lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering the blossoms of empty azure and scattering them amidst the yellow qi. She exhales yang essence and red qi to irrigate the adept’s form, raining from within to without. The yellow and red qi intertwine, illuminating the entire body. The Lady bestows upon the adept six cinnabar-written characters in purple script, then guides the adept to swallow the yellow qi twenty-four times and the yang essence twelve times, then knock the teeth twenty-four times. Looking upward, recite the incantation:

Flowing fire spans ten thousand *qing*,
the essence of the Cavernous Yang.
The Yang Peace Pavilion,
the Three Blossoms Jade City.
Golden immortals shine within,
the Eight Essences and Four Lights.
The Nine Luminaries descend their qi,
the Primordial Upper Numinous Ones.
The Lady rinses with fragrance,
scattering blossoms in the Jade Clarity.
Cinnabar writes purple characters,
binding sounds to empty azure.
Orchid Pool’s jade moisture
flows and washes the Eight Darknesses.
Crimson light streams through the canopy,
fresh glory suffuses all under heaven.
Revolving morning’s curved luminaries,
they oversee and illuminate my form.
My form and the crimson sun
share death and share life.
Riding the empty, driving the void,
harnessing flying chariots.
Jade maidens assist in position,
golden lads aid the numinous.
Beneath a light canopy of kingfisher feathers,
ascend to the Emperor’s Courtyard.

Afterward, swallow qi twenty-four times and saliva twelve times, then ingest the cinnabar-written purple characters. Practicing this Dao for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept cinnabar-written true scriptures and a jade pendant for the sun’s center, enabling flight and ascent to the Cavernous Yang Palace.

**Ascending to the Grand Ultimate Palace**

The *True Numinous Life Talisman of Grand Ultimate Refinement and Transformation* was originally recorded in the *First Jade Radiance Chapter of the Supreme Transformation and Cavernous Void*, concealed within the Grand Ultimate Great Palace. Those who practice the Dao in pursuit of immortality, contemplating the divine and preserving the true, repenting sins and dissolving transgressions, and aspiring to the grace of communion with the numinous, shall on the day of the Beginning of Spring inscribe the text with green ink, face east, and ingest one talisman. Thereby, all past offenses disperse, and the Grand Ultimate inscribes their name upon the jade tablet. After eight years of practice without deviation, the Grand Ultimate grants eight jade lads. Through meditative communion, the celestial perfected descend, and the adept beholds their divine forms, attaining the chariot of the Eight Radiant Ones to ascend to the Grand Ultimate Palace.

*Excerpted from the* Cavernous Perfection Eight Dao Jade Radiance Hidden Talismans.

**The Supreme Perfected Middle Prime Six Jia Yang-Generated Transformation Numinous Talisman**
This talisman arises from the essence of the Supreme Jia Yang Spirit, transforming into jade script to assist the Supreme Perfected of the Lofty Dawn in transmuting the qi of the eight directions, communicating with the divine, summoning the perfected, preserving life, and ensuring longevity. After eight years of ingestion, nine jade lads from the Grand Ultimate Upper Palace are bestowed to the adept, enabling communion with the numinous. They summon the cloud chariot of the Eight Radiant Ones to welcome the adept in flight, ascending to the Grand Ultimate Crimson Palace.

The Supreme Perfected transform, and the Lower Prime generates life. The Eight Radiant Divine Palaces assist the practitioner’s body. Those who know the precious names of the Supreme Perfected’s palaces, abodes, and the talismans of their attire and conveyance may summon the qi of the Eight Radiant Ones, causing the forms of the Supreme Perfected to descend and illuminate their own body, invoking the numinous and commanding the qi to employ the officials of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. After eight years of talisman ingestion and practice, the Lofty Supreme is moved to joy, and the true numinous descend to appear. They bestow the Eight Radiant Divine Officials, flying clouds, and feathered canopies to transport the adept upward into the pure, transforming the eight directions and ascending to the Grand Ultimate Palace.

These nine celestial numinous texts are conferred upon those whose names are inscribed on golden tablets and jade registers within the Grand Ultimate. Those who behold their contents transcend life and death to attain immortality. To recklessly divulge these most sacred prohibitions is to incur the Nine Heavens’ punishment of piercing treachery, and one’s body shall be conscripted into the labor of Mount Meng.

*Excerpted from the* Cavernous Perfection Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods of Transformation.

The Dao states: The wheel of fortune and blessings neither perishes nor arises anew. Those who diligently study, revere their masters’ treasures, and form karmic bonds with the Dao remain unbroken across lifetimes—all due to the accumulated practices of past existences. Such is this Dharma-wheel: superior adepts strive earnestly, widely opening the gates of the Dao. They place others before themselves, deliver kings from suffering, restrain their speech to aid the destitute, and bare their forms to clothe the cold.

The virtue extends to birds and beasts, and kindness reaches all living beings. Revering the master and upholding the Dharma is ever as if standing before the gods. Perpetual fasting, earnest contemplation, and profound study of the Cavernous Mystery—exhaling and inhaling qi and fluids, the heart ashen and the will diligent. Severing the burdens of sensual desire, all myriad thoughts dissolve. With harmonious emotions and gentle qi, both humans and spirits rejoice. Such conduct, though it entails one death and one rebirth, ensures the will never falters, and one attains the rank of superior immortal.

When the Three Masters are fully attained, the body ascends to the Great Ultimate, the rank of Immortal Minister is conferred, and boundless wondrous penetrations arise, thoughts transforming into spirit.

*Gatha:*
Wondrous penetrations turn my spirit,
Vast and universal, measureless merit.
The Dao accomplished through kalpas of heaven and earth,
Transformations unfold across the Nine Heavens.
Extinction and rebirth transcend life and death,
Each karmic encounter has its own origin.
Who deeply awakens to the toil of past and future,
Finds form and soul without beginning or end.
Accumulated blessings inscribe the foundation of fortune,
The body escapes the Five Peaks of Tribulation.
Liberated from the Three Evil Paths,
Serenely one enters the Hall of Leisure.
Thoughts ferry boundless realms,
Meditation stabilizes and invokes divine penetrations.
The Dharma-wheel turns thrice,
Assisting the attainment of High Immortal Lords.
Turning my steps like the great *chun* tree,
I soar aloft to the Palace of the Great Ultimate.

The Supreme Mystery of the Primordial One addressed the Immortal Lord, saying: "By command of the Supreme, I am sent to bestow upon you this wondrous scripture of admonitions, expounding the Dharma and teaching the doctrine—its subtlety reaches this utmost perfection. This text is secretly preserved within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Supreme; were it not for one worthy of the rank of Immortal Lord, its words could not be seen. Now I impart its precepts to perfect your immortality. You should treasure this record, diligently practice the Dao, and attain its fruition—then shall I welcome you to the Palace of the Great Ultimate." The Immortal Lord bowed deeply, received the precepts, and departed.

**Chapter on Ascending to the Palace of Grand Tenuity**

The Supreme stated: The reason the Realized One values the One as the True One is simply this: the One alone. What the One conjoins, the Great Void responds and transforms; the One’s transformations adapt, and heaven and earth darkly harmonize. Thus, the Upper One is the Celestial Emperor of the body, the Middle One is the Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace, and the Lower One is the Primal King of the Yellow Court. The true essence of these Three Ones collectively oversees the twenty-four qi within the body. Qi receives life, and life establishes the body, corresponding above to the twenty-four Perfected Ones of Grand Tenuity. When the true qi circulates in harmony, the myriad beings take form; spirit and qi intermingle and separate, dwelling in the dim and distant Purple Chamber.

Now, qi coalesces from empty mist to become spirit. Spirit relies on the Three Ones to self-generate. Transformations are the creations of the Three Ones. Those who attain transformation all conceal themselves through spirit, merging the Yellow to achieve the ultimate mystery. The Three Ones and Primordial Lords each possess true qi. When true qi coalesces, it spontaneously forms a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, cloud-borne carriages and feathered canopies. Constantly they enter the Purple Palace within, ascending to Jade Purity, where they are arrayed in the Primordial Chart, transforming the womb to protect the embryo.

By nurturing the body with the Three Ones, one becomes a Realized One, soaring through the Nine Empyreans to serve the Most High. Thus, what the One accomplishes gives rise to heaven and earth—it is not merely the trivial affairs of crawling insects and wriggling creatures. If you can guard it with unwavering firmness, then essence will respond and flow unimpeded. When essence responds and flows unimpeded, the Three Primes become visible; when the Three Primes become visible, white qi thickens and transforms. As white qi thickens and transforms, the Yellow merges and spontaneously generates—then the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders suddenly arrive. Feathered canopies may be steered, cloud-borne carriages may be ridden, and thus you ascend to heaven in broad daylight, reaching the Palace of Grand Tenuity.

Within the Heaven of Grand Tenuity are twenty-four qi, the Yellow intermingling and coalescing, qi transforming and changing. At times, they suddenly separate, and in a flash, life arises within a single qi of transformation. From this, twenty-four Perfected Ones are born, coalescing from emptiness, not through womb or embryo—all are the qi of the Three Ones, the Imperial Sovereigns, which divide and transform the Dao, entrusting the mysterious to establish their forms. If you can guard the Three Ones within the body, then the true lords of the Three Primes and Imperial Sovereigns of the Heaven of Grand Tenuity will descend and appear externally, even conversing with you face to face.

Within the body are also twenty-four Perfected Ones, likewise formed from the body’s mysterious qi and refined spirits, dividing and transforming to create the myriad beings. When the cloud-borne carriage arrives, harmonize qi and dawn’s radiance to ascend to Grand Tenuity. The twenty-four Perfected Ones of Grand Tenuity will all feast in harmony with the spirits within your body amidst the merging Yellow, sharing their radiance within the Purple Chamber, entrusting their forms and qi to a thousand paths. Those who return transform like moxa back into infancy, altering the register of death in the Northern Feng, receiving eternal abiding in the Imperial Homeland, entering and exiting Jade Purity, resting in Grand Tenuity.

If one attains only a single Dao, the Three Primes remain incomplete. By focusing the mind solely on the One, one may still attain longevity and immortality, entering the Grand Clarity alone, yet cannot roam the northern heavens of Grand Tenuity’s radiance or ascend to the Palace of Highest Clarity.

The **Mysterious Talisman of Grand Tenuity’s Hidden Ascent**, an ancient text from the Supreme’s *Transformations of the Cavernous Void, Sixth Jade Radiance Chapter*, is preserved in the Abbey of Grand Tenuity. Those who practice the Dao and seek immortality, contemplate the spirit and preserve the true, repent sins and resolve transgressions, and aspire to the Great Emperor and Most Sagely Revered Deities—imploring the pardon of past sins—should, on the autumnal equinox, write the text in white ink, face northwest, and ingest six talismans. Then the host of spirits will erase their names from the ledger of sins, inscribe their lifespans on jade tablets, and the Bureau of Destiny will deliver them to life, safeguarding their destiny as immortals. After eight years of practice, without missing a single step, the Supreme Emperor will grant twelve Jade Maidens to communicate with the true and summon the numinous. Divine beings will descend, all wishes will be fulfilled, and the six radiant chariots will arrive, enabling flight to ascend to the Palace of Highest Clarity and Grand Tenuity.

The **Two Talismans of the Upper Perfected’s Birth and the Lower Prime’s Yin-Yang Transformations**: inscribe the upper talisman in blue and the lower in white. On the day of the beginning of spring, first ingest the lower talisman, then the upper. On the autumnal equinox, first ingest the upper talisman, then the lower. When about to ingest the talismans, knock the teeth twelve times and softly recite: "The two essences ascend as numinous spirits, communicating with the divine and summoning the true. They summon the eight qi of radiance to descend into my body."

A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, their breath coalescing into mist, the jade radiance lingers in cycles as the Three Palaces array their spirits. Within and without align in harmony, soaring to ascend the Nine Heavens. Transforming into the imperial aurora, they pay homage to the Jade Venerable. Conclude by lifting the head to swallow the eight qi eight times. Practicing this for eight years, the Upper Perfected’s hidden radiance curves to reflect, the Eight Radiant Forms appear, and the ten thousand riders of the divine officials manifest, bearing one aloft to ascend into the Palace of Grand Tenuity.

*Excerpted from the* Cavernous Perfection’s Seventy-Four Methods of Transformation Scripture.

The Upper Perfected and Middle Prime’s Yin-Extremity Transformation Numinous Talisman—this is the essence of the Supreme Yi’s Cavernous Yin-Extremity, aiding the Upper Prime’s Middle Perfected Eight Radiant Divine Officials to ascend and commune with the celestial perfected, descending into the human body to summon numinous spirits and summon qi, the officials of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. Ingesting it for eight years, eight jade maidens of numinous flight will manifest, bestowing the arts of summoning spirit elixirs, divine mushrooms, and transformative techniques, calling forth the Eight Radiant Chariots to bear one aloft in flight, ascending to the Palace of Grand Tenuity.

The Upper Perfected and Middle Prime’s Yin-Yang Transformation Two Talismans: inscribe the upper talisman in blue and the lower in white. On the day of the beginning of spring, first ingest the lower talisman, then the upper. On the autumnal equinox, first ingest the upper talisman, then the lower. When about to ingest the talismans, knock the teeth twelve times and softly recite: "Supreme Yi, true father and true mother, unite the two numinous qi to irrigate the Six Primes, transforming and giving birth to the Eight Radiant Forms. Cavernously divine, ever-changing, the Upper Clarity’s hidden truth curves to descend, coming to witness my form. May I be enabled to ride the Eight Radiant Chariots and ascend to the Cloud Court of the Grand Ultimate." Conclude by lifting the head to swallow the qi eight times. Practicing this for eight years, one will perceive the Eight Radiant Forms, divine officials will descend and manifest, and one will ascend to the Palace of Grand Tenuity.

*Excerpted from the* Cavernous Perfection’s Azure Essentials and Purple Writings of the Golden Root Upper Scripture.

Scholars must clarify the precious names of the Middle Perfected, their palaces, bureaus, and dwelling places, ingesting and employing the numinous talismans to summon the qi of the Eight Radiant Forms. These ascend to manifest the forms of the Middle Perfected and descend to illuminate one’s chamber, summoning numinous spirits to attain immortality and command the officials of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. Practicing the talismans for eight years, the Most High will be moved to joy, and the divine officials of the Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Forms will descend to manifest upon one’s body, bestowing the Eight Radiant Cloud Chariots to bear one aloft to the Purple Tenuity Palace and the Eastern Flowery Realm of Fangzhu.

These methods and texts are transmitted only to those whose names are inscribed on the Eastern Flowery’s golden tablets and jade characters. Without such predestined affinity, one may not partake or inquire. To see even the titles of these scriptures without proper transmission brings the calamity of nine generations ascending as immortals. Reckless disclosure or negligence incurs the punishment of the wind-blade’s trial, and the Nine Heavens’ piercing of treachery, forfeiting one’s years of life.

The Middle Prime’s transformations of the Lower Prime give birth to the Eight Radiant Divine Officials to assist the scholar’s body. Scholars should know the precious names of the Middle Perfected, their palaces, bureaus, and dwelling places, employing the numinous talismans to summon the qi of the Eight Radiant Forms, descending to manifest the forms of the Upper Perfected and illuminating one’s body below, summoning numinous qi and commanding the officials of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. Practicing the talismans for eight years, the Most High will be moved to joy, and true numinous spirits will descend, bestowing the Eight Radiant Divine Officials and jade cloud chariots to welcome and bear one aloft to the Palace of Purple Tenuity. This Dao is lofty and wondrous, not circulated in the lower world. Those who attain it transcend life and death. To recklessly disclose its numinous texts incurs the punishment of the wind-blade’s trial, consigning one to servitude at the River Source.

The Middle Prime disperses the twenty-four qi, transforming and giving birth to the Three Qi, Eight Radiant Forms, and Cavernous Perfection’s twenty-four divine officials, who govern the scholar’s body below. The Middle Prime’s Palace’s crimson primordial qi transforms, arising from the void, each accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders to guard and protect one’s form. If one contemplates the celestial perfected within the heart, naturally summoning numinous countenances within the secluded chamber, then the divine officials of the Three Eights will manifest without delay, and jade lads and jade maidens will instantly obey commands. Within eight years, the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders will bring forth the Eight Radiant Jade Chariots to bear one aloft to the Palace of Purple Tenuity.

Those who cultivate the Nine Perfected and Eightfold Dao without these texts should still direct their thoughts toward the mysterious and exalted, lest they waste their efforts in vain speech and sight. Thus, the twenty-four spirits reside within the human body, summoning the twenty-four perfected above, stabilizing the twenty-four palaces in the middle, and communicating with the twenty-four qi below. If one spirit is not settled, then the myriad spirits will not be at peace; the palaces and dwellings will lie empty and abandoned, the red child will take flight, malevolent demons will enter, and the myriad illnesses will arise together. Without knowing this, how can one attain immortality? How can one summon the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders? How can one ride the Eight Radiant Chariots?

The Supreme Perfected and the Lower Origin’s Yin generate the numinous talismans of transformation—these are the numinous scripts born of the Dark Yin essence of the Northern Quarter, aiding the Eight Radiant Divine Officials of the Upper Origin and Lower Perfected. Above, they connect with celestial qi; below, they assist the adept’s body, summoning the perfected and attracting the numinous, the officials of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. Ingesting them for eight years, the Eight Jade Women of the Great Mystery will descend in form. They will dispatch commands to obtain the True Scriptures of the Nine Heavens and the Divine Charts of the Jade Peaks, summoning the Eight Radiant Jade Chariots to ascend and soar into the Upper Clarity. This script is concealed within the Supreme Tenuity’s Upper Observatory, emerging once every forty thousand kalpas in accordance with the Mysterious Canon.

**Illuminating the Numinous: The Eight Sages’ Chart**
Upper Section: Third True Qi

The Three Radiant Spout Numinous Flowers,
Resplendent, the Eight Gates open.
Within dwells the Spirit of Wisdom,
Clad in raiment to soar through the heavens.

The Eight Sages channel the numinous qi,
Jade talismans penetrate the subtle and profound.
Precious clouds reflect the jade characters,
Mighty beasts shake the heavens with their might.

Brilliant, the Eight Assemblies’ Palaces,
In profusion, the numinous beings take flight.
With concentrated thought, summon the true qi—
The Five Talismans radiate luminous splendor.
The Eight Radiant urge the Jade Chariot,
Ascending the void to enter the Purple Tenuity.

To Ascend the Supreme Clarity Grade

Those who wish to soar through the Nine Clarities, to feast their vision at the Southern Pavilion, to turn their jade pendants in the Hall of Light, to draw golden earrings to the Muddy Pellet, to summon the true soul at the morning lamp, and to invoke the flying radiance from the Imperial Lord—when practicing this Way, at dusk lie down with both hands resting upon the heart, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the jade pendant’s azure yang qi. Its light and hue are dimly luminous, like the roundness of sun and moon, suffusing the body with emptiness and penetrating the soul’s essence.

The Imperial Lord’s surname is Kaiyuan, his given name Xu Ming. His form is nine inches tall, his head crowned with a purple cap, draped in a beaded embroidered robe, wearing a flying brocade azure skirt. He bears the moon at his waist and the sun in his mouth, riding a green crow. Within the azure light, he descends into the body, settling and stabilizing the Muddy Pellet. The practitioner should knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva twenty-nine times, and recite the yin incantation:

*"Mystic Origin, Great Void,
Nine Heavens’ soul essence.
Morning lamp shines bright,
Qi congeals in dim clarity.
Named Jade Pendant,
Illuminating the Great Luminance.
Bearing the moon, holding the sun,
Inscribing talismans, grasping bells.
Radiant splendor flows,
Pervading heaven’s gloom.
Riding azure wings,
Crimson shafts and purple carriage.
First feasting the Three Origins,
Descending to my mystery.
Anchored in the Muddy Pellet,
Flowing into the Yellow Court.
Governing soul and spirit,
All gods at peace.
Five viscera knit and bind,
Nine apertures flourish in bloom.
Eight Radiant ascend in flight,
Rising into Jade Clarity."*

Afterward, press the hands to the hairline nine times, wipe the eyes fourteen times, swallow qi three times, and then lie down. Thus, the soul is at peace, the spirit settled, all gods stabilize the palace, inner numinous qi is fortified, outer demonic sources are sealed, the Eight Radiant transform, and true refinement transfigures into immortality. In nine years, one may fathom the hidden depths, trace the yet-unmanifest, sit and vanish at will, and with the gods reverse aging. After eighteen years, the Dao is perfected, the true descends, and one soars into Supreme Clarity.

—From the *Supreme Scripture of the Jade Pendant and Golden Earrings of the Great Ultimate Golden Writ*

Written in cinnabar on purple script, the Moon’s Soul conceals its sounds—all inscribed in the western groves of the Moon’s *Qian* Trees, forming a natural script. The august lords of all heavens gather on the vernal equinox to harvest the purple script’s cinnabar characters and ingest them. By consuming these six characters, the radiant blaze suffuses the body. The seven treasures of the Moon’s Jade Pendant may be perceived clearly. On the vernal equinox at dusk, write them in white on yellow paper and ingest them, knocking the teeth twelve times while softly reciting:

*"Great brilliance gleams in central heaven,
Bright rosy clouds adorn the golden chamber.
Jade characters array in auspicious clouds,
Cinnabar script forms clustered groves.
Flying songs scatter the vermilion groves,
In the vast desert’s depths.
Numinous sounds sing naturally,
Subtle words of the Eight Pure Palaces.
All heavens sip golden incense,
Flowing nectar bathes my countenance.
Virtue shared with heaven’s people,
August lords descend with purple youths.
Bearing me beyond the Nine Voids,
Ascending to the Vermilion Moon Palace."*

Afterward, swallow qi twenty-four times and cease. Further, inscribe the cinnabar characters of the purple pendant upon the head. In three years, a natural purple light will arise, suffusing the body’s form, enabling flight into Supreme Clarity.

The Way of seeking immortality: on the vernal equinox at dusk, enter the chamber, face west, recline or sit as desired, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the Lady of Azure Light within the Moon. Her surname and given name are [omitted], her form nine inches tall, her hair bound in a cloud-like bun, wearing a brocade cloud-feather skirt. She holds the sun’s light in her mouth and descends into the practitioner’s eyes. Presently, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, flowing throughout the body. The Lady gathers blossoms from the *Qian* Grove in the Moon’s center, scattering them amidst the yellow qi. From her mouth, she exhales the yang essence’s crimson qi, pouring it into the body, from within to without. The yellow and crimson qi intertwine, illuminating the entire form. The Lady bestows the six sounds of the cinnabar characters of the purple script upon the body, then draws in the yellow qi twenty-four times and the yang essence sixteen times, ceasing afterward. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite while looking upward:

*"Golden governance refines eightfold,
Cinnabar pools vast and deep.
Jade nectar cascades,
Flowing through the Eight *Qian*.
Yellow qi rises in abundance,
Yang essence congeals as mist.
Gathering blossoms in the Orchid Court,
Flying skirts converse.
The Lady sips fragrance,
August lords pour nectar.
Gentle radiance melts in time,
Intercalary rains of all heavens.
Cinnabar brilliance eightfold bright,
Luminous and resplendent.
Turning and reflecting,
Descending into my body,
To long preserve the soul’s years with the Moon’s essence.
Riding the void, steering the floating,
Reaching the boundless."*

Swallow qi twenty-four times, swallow saliva sixteen times, then ingest the cinnabar characters of the purple script. Practicing this Way for eight years, the Lady will bestow the true sounds of the cinnabar characters and the Moon’s flying blossoms upon the body, brushing the form. The face will assume a golden countenance, enabling flight into Supreme Clarity.

—From the *Scripture of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence of Supreme Clarity*

The Highest Sage and Imperial Lord said: The method for inscribing one’s name on the Mystic Tablet and soaring into Supreme Clarity—on the third day of the third month at the hour of *Shanghe*, bathe, purify, and fast. At mealtime, enter the chamber, burn incense, face north, and bow nine times to worship the Jade Heaven. Afterward, face north, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize within the fasting hall a cloud of purple qi, arising in abundance and crowning the chamber. Envision the Five Elder Immortals within the purple cloud, draped in flying azure feathered robes, crowned with *Tongtian* jade coronets, holding green-script registers. The Jade Lads of the Immortals wear cloud-brocade robes, seven-jeweled jade coronets, and hold silver tablets. Visualize the two perfected ones inscribing the name upon the white tablet, recording it in the green-script register, and entrusting the tablet to the Inspector of the Perfected. The name is then recorded among the Left Immortals, memorialized to the Seven Sage Emperors of the Nine Heavens. Once the tablet is inscribed and the name fixed, the Five Elder Immortals and the Jade Lads merge into the body’s Grotto Chamber. Softly recite:

*"Heavenly Origin, auspicious fortune,
*Shanghe* of the Six Chen."*

The Nine Emperors command the numinous, the Seven Sages unfold the true. The Void Mystery records the register, Donghua compiles the scroll. The name is engraved upon the imperial tablet, eternally preserving the Upper Immortal. Sounds and tones harmonize, my body naturally aligns. The purple womb jade-bright, inner radiance like fine jade. The face shines with golden splendor, the bones transform like silver. Rare hairs of wondrous hues entwine above and below. The mysterious descends from the Nine Heavens, turning the purple chariot of heaven. Six dragons and five serpents ascend to the imperial court. The Three Origins converge in celebration, achieving as spoken.

Conclude by bowing seven times to the Seven Sages, swallowing seven breaths to finish. Practice this for seven years, and the Perfected One will manifest, personally inscribing the register, descending to bestow the Three Origins. Riding the void, stepping through emptiness, ascending to the Upper Clarity.

The Most High Sage Lord says: To inscribe your name in the Great Ultimate, on the white tablet with green script, and soar to the Palace of the Great Ultimate, you must on the third day of the third month write in green on a white tablet with green script, face the Chen direction while ingesting it, knock the teeth twelve times, and softly recite:

*"Threefold union forms the covenant,
The mysterious net governs the stars.
The fivefold body follows the diagram,
The mysterious tablet bears green script.
The name is inscribed in the Great Ultimate,
Rank aligned with the Upper Immortal.
The Three Origins are arrayed,
The Six Qi spread forth.
Golden tones and jade characters,
I desire to be naturally so.
To ride the flying radiance,
Ascend to the imperial dawn."*

Conclude by swallowing breath ten times, bowing four times toward the Chen direction. Cease after paying homage to the Four Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate. Practice this for nine years, and the Great Ultimate will inscribe your name. The Four Perfected Ones will descend to bestow upon you the true script, spontaneously unraveling the luminous tones, soaring to the Upper Clarity.

The Most High Sage Lord says: To inscribe your name in the Upper Origin of the Mysterious Palace, with green-gold and red-script hidden texts, and soar above the Mysterious Palace, you must on the eighth day of the eighth month write in green, green-gold, and red script with ten tones, face west while ingesting it, knock the teeth nine times, and softly recite:

*"Heaven turns, qi spreads to rectify the four cardinal directions,
Three and five intertwine, the nine paths form a cluster.
Green-gold and red script,
Script radiant in the great void.
The mysterious diagram suspends its tones,
Eight reachings, fourfold penetration.
Profound subtleties are fathomed,
Brilliant vision knows no bounds.
To pay homage to the Three Origins,
Advance to the Purple Chamber.
Entering and exiting the Three Clarities,
Eternally preserving the flourishing origin."*

Conclude by swallowing breath six times, bowing six times to pay homage to the Upper Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Palace. Practice this for nine years, and the Upper Origin will engrave the script. The green-gold and red-script hidden texts will naturally become clear, delving into the profound and exhausting the subtle. Communing with spirits, riding the void in flight, ascending to the Upper Clarity.

—From the *Scripture of the Primal Record of the Seven Sage Lords of the Cavern Realms*

The Yellow Emperor’s Talisman for Summoning the Numinous and Attracting the True to Subdue Demons: write in vermilion on a yellow wooden tablet, nine inches wide and twelve inches long, and place it in the center of the chamber. Practice reciting the scripture and enter the chamber for a hundred days, conversing with divine beings. After three years, the chamber will naturally generate the numinous yellow mist. To summon celestial immortals, inscribe according to the method, place the talisman facing south, and meditate with focused intent for a hundred days. The Perfected One will manifest, and immortals will visit your chamber to bestow upon you the Way of the Divine Perfected One. To subdue demons, inscribe according to the method and place it facing north. Recite the chapter of the Great Void once, and the Northern Emperor will wield his troops. Heavenly demons will lose their forms, myriad spirits vanish without trace, and all within and without will be purified and clear. Also, write in vermilion on a nine-inch yellow silk sash and wear it on the body. After eight years, the Emperor will dispatch the wandering chariot to welcome your body, ascending to the Upper Clarity.

—From the *Scripture of the Talisman for Attracting the True and Subduing Demons of the Cavern Realms*

The Two Talismans of the Middle Perfected and the Lower Origin’s Yin-Yang Transformations: write the upper in vermilion and the lower in black. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, first ingest the lower talisman, then the upper. On the Winter Solstice, first ingest the upper talisman, then the lower. When ingesting the talismans, knock the teeth twelve times and softly recite:

*"The Purple Origin intermingles in harmony,
The two qi unite in numinosity.
The Great One transforms the spirit,
The Cavern Origin opens life.
Yin and Yang guide and nurture,
Cultivating and refining luminosity.
Above irrigates, below irrigates,
The Six Perfections exhale essence.
Turning the true, curving reflections,
Descend to my court.
Penetrating the profound, perceiving clearly,
Brilliantly beholding the divine form.
The Eight Radiant Ones assist the immortal,
Enabling my Dao to be fulfilled.
Transforming and responding mysteriously,
Sitting to transcend the Three Clarities.
Eternally equal to heaven and earth,
Unshaken for ten thousand kalpas."*

Conclude by looking up and swallowing eight breaths. Practice this for eight years, and the Upper Perfected Eight Radiant Ones will descend to your body, soaring to the Upper Clarity.

—From the *Upper Scripture of the Golden Root of the Azure Essentials and Purple Writ of the Cavern Realms*

The Upper Perfected and Lower Origin’s Yin-Generated Numinous Talisman: this is the essence of the mysterious yin of the northern upper heavens, transformed into numinous script to assist the Eight Radiant Divine Palaces of the Upper Origin and Lower Perfected. Above, it connects with heavenly qi; below, it descends into the practitioner’s body, summoning the true and attracting the numinous, with officials of a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. Ingest it for eight years, and the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery will manifest, dispatching you to obtain the true script of the Nine Heavens and the divine diagrams of the Five Peaks, summoning the Eight Radiant Jade Chariot to soar to the Upper Clarity.

—From the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods of Transformation of the Cavern Realms*

The Secret Name-Tab of the Jade Pendant of the Mysterious Yang of the Inner Hidden Sound of the Heavenly Soul Essence of Brahmā-Kāśyapa: this is the qi of the Mysterious Yang of Brahmā-Kāśyapa Heaven, governing the inner spirits of the Perfected Ones in the Grotto Valley Palace. Write in yellow on white silk and wear it on the body. Also, write on white paper and ingest it on the eight solar terms of your life’s destiny. Internally visualize the Perfected Ones of the Grotto Valley Palace for three years, carefully determining and clearly seeing their true forms. After eighteen years, you will ride the Eight Radiant Cloud Chariot, soaring to the Upper Clarity.

—From the *Nine Yang Talismans of the Perfected Ones of the Cavern Realms*

To receive the qi of the Boundless Heaven of Yuddaṇḍa: on the ninth day of the sixth month at dawn, the nineteenth day at noon, and the twenty-ninth day at midnight—three days and three times in one month—bathe in fragrant water, enter the chamber, burn incense, bow nine times to the northwest toward the Primordial Father, bow three times to the southeast toward the Mysterious Mother, then face the lunar station and sit upright. Knock the teeth thirty-six times, close your eyes, and envision the Heavenly King of the Boundless Heaven of Yuddaṇḍa, whose surname is *Hun* and whose hidden name is *Shuangniancuo*, wearing a nine-colored, seamless, naturally patterned fur robe, crowned with a radiant solar circlet. He rides a nine-scaled jade wheel, accompanied by twenty-four jade immortals, descending into the Crimson Palace of your body. Visualize the crimson cloud qi, dense and luxuriant, crowning and enveloping your form.

After a long while, draw in the cloud qi nine times and swallow it, then softly recite the incantation:

The qi of the Nine Heavens,
now fills and suffuses me.
It settles the Eight Radiant Forms,
arraying them through the Three Palaces.
The ten thousand spirits take their places,
the numinous and the true commune.
The Director of Destinies fixes my record,
the Great One lends support.
The Three and the Five align in harmony,
I behold the Great Yang in motion.
Three transformations, nine revolutions—
return me to the Imperial Homeland.
Golden chariot and jade canopy,
flanked by jade radiance descending,
come to my body,
settle my Golden Chamber.
Guard me in unity,
soar with me in flight.
Ascend to the Great Mystery,
feast in the Imperial Chamber.

When finished, swallow the qi nine times and cease. After three years of this practice, five blossoms arise in the heart, the ten thousand qi transform, and one perceives the hidden and examines the obscure, speaking with spirits as with equals. After nine years, one rides the Eight Radiant Forms and flies to the Upper Clarity.

—From *The Wondrous Record of the Upper Refinement of the Nine Elixirs and the Transformation of Embryonic Essence*

On the first day of the tenth, eleventh, fourth, and eighth months at dawn, face the king and bow twice. Ingest one *liang* of *langgan* blossom elixir with east-flowing water. Then the seven-colored qi will crown your head, your face will gleam with golden blossoms and jade radiance. Holding the breath summons the chariot of the Eight Mysteries; spitting on the ground transforms it into a flying dragon. A whistle to the left brings immortals to court; a gesture to the right unites the Three Purities with the wind. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascend to the Upper Clarity.

—From *The Purple Text of the Wondrous Scripture of the Great Tenuity*

The Central Great Yellow Myriad-Beginning Jade Talisman: To summon the Jade Director of the Yellow Emperor, on the day of one’s natal year-star, face the year-star and ingest the talisman inscribed in red on yellow paper, then wear it inscribed in red on yellow silk. After nine years, if the Jade Director erases your death from the records, he will transfer your life to the Palace of Birth and dispatch a flying chariot of yellow mist to welcome your body, ascending to the Palace of Upper Clarity.

—From *The Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Wondrous Scripture*

Forty-five contemplations align with the number of heaven and earth, accord with the Dao of nature, and generate boundless, revolving blessings. The spirit enters wondrous communion, delves into the profound, and unites with the Dao in true thought. Once the contemplation is settled, one sits as cloud-dragons and the Eight Radiant Forms descend, and the jade chariot ascends to Upper Clarity.

—From *The Scripture of the Wheel of the Wondrous Origin*

To practice the absorption of the Five Stars in a single night, ensure it is done regularly and comprehensively. In spring, begin with the star of the East; in summer, begin with the star of the South. Follow the dominant month and its corresponding star as the primary star, without being constrained to a single direction, but rather proceeding according to the star’s position and orientation.

When the sky is overcast and no stars are visible, perform the practice within your bedchamber, inwardly visualizing the Five Directions as one. The Perfected One states: "Visualizing the stars within the chamber is no different from seeing them with your eyes—do not abandon the practice simply because the stars are not visible." This is the Hidden Dao of the Supreme Thearch, the secret method of ascending at dawn.

When swallowing the radiance of the stars, at that moment fully visualize the Supreme Thearchs of the Star Perfected Ones and the Supreme Thearchs’ Consorts descending upon the light and entering your mouth as you swallow. With eyes closed, faintly perceive their forms.

By constantly cultivating this Hidden Method of the Supreme Thearch and invoking the Supreme Thearchs of the Five Stars, within five years you will dimly perceive their forms; in seven years, you will see them and walk alongside them; in fourteen years, the Five Stars will unite and descend together, bearing you upon a dark-flowered chariot, enveloped in the Three Simplicities and purple clouds. Preceded by the Five Thearchs and followed by the Ten Thousand Perfected, the Five Stars will escort you to ascend at dawn, ascend to the Jade Purity, and receive the scriptures to become a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity.

—From the *Eight Simplicities of the Cavern-Real Perfected Scripture*

The Azure Thearch of the Eastern Marchmount: inwardly visualize the Nine Crimson-Speckled Talisman of Jia-Yi Entering Wood. The Azure Thearch Lord of the East, surnamed Chang and named Jing Meng, wears the Nine Origins Celestial Crown upon his head, dons azure brocade, and drapes a flying skirt of jade-green brocade. He bears the Supreme Thearch’s Nine Qi Life-Spirit Seal and the Azure Feather Intertwined-Spirit Sash. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, he rides a cloud chariot drawn by nine azure dragons, accompanied by twelve Azure Waist Jade Maidens, each holding nine-colored banners of the Azure Forest’s blossoms. He roams the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai, reviewing the records of Perfected Ones and Immortal Officials, and at times visits the Water Thearch of the Eastern Sea to audit the merits, transgressions, and demerits of those who study the Dao.

When returning to bestow the talisman upon the practitioner, the adept should ingest the talisman to summon its spirit, visualize its qi, and draw down its Perfected One. Seek to have one’s name erased from the Water Thearch’s ledger and inscribed in the Jade Register. On the day of the Beginning of Spring at dawn, bathe, purify, and fast, then enter your chamber, burn incense, and ingest the Nine Crimson-Speckled Talisman of Jia-Yi Entering Wood. After nine years of practice, you will be able to inscribe talismans and cast them into mountains, causing mountains to summon clouds and rain, swiftly vanishing into obscurity; inscribe talismans and cast them into water, causing dragons in the water to descend into abysses ten thousand fathoms deep. If you inscribe talismans upon wood while among people, the writing will not fade but grow clearer. Carrying the talisman and embracing a tree, your body will transform into a mountain forest, guarded by twelve Immortal Officials of the Eastern Marchmount. After eighteen years, you will be able to fly and ascend to the Highest Clarity.

The Lord of the Northern Marchmount, Mount Heng, on the day of the Winter Solstice presents memorials listing the names of Perfected Immortals who have attained the Dao and those who have just begun their studies, reporting to the Supreme Thearch Lord on high. He records and reviews the mysterious names, distinguishing merits from transgressions.

To cultivate the Dao of Flying Immortality, on that day at midnight, bathe, fast, and purify, then enter your chamber and burn incense. Face north and visualize the Lord of Mount Heng, surnamed Fu and named Tong Meng, who wears the Five Origins Treasure Dawn Jade Crown, dons a flying skirt of black brocade, and drapes a robe of Mysterious Pattern Bright Light. He bears the Intertwined-Spirit Purple Sash and rides a dark cloud flying wheel, accompanied by twelve Immortal Officials of the Northern Marchmount, all riding flying turtles and holding five-colored banners. They turn toward the northwest, ascending to the boundless heights of the Jade Purity Heaven, wandering amidst the void within black clouds. Strike your teeth five times and silently recite: "Today is most auspicious, the Eight Nodal Points return in cycle. May the Dao Lord deign to glance upon me, descend into my body, take charge of my life’s register, and eternally preserve my celestial years."

Conclude by visualizing the Lord of Mount Heng descending upon your chamber in a flying wheel of black clouds, black qi billowing and filling the room. The Lord stands amidst the black qi, holding a purple tablet and inscribing your name upon it. Softly recite the incantation:

Mysterious Yin returns the spirit,
Riding the sun to govern the dawn.
The Five Qi gather the Perfected,
Universally governing the host of immortals.
Surveying the radiance of the Upper Palace,
Wandering amidst the cloud array.
Deign to descend and oversee,
Come to my chamber’s eaves.
Inscribe my name on the Mysterious Tablet,
Record it in the Jade Register above.
May my Dao shine brightly,
Penetrating and entering the Perfected.
Command the Five Spirits,
Seal rivers and summon mountains.
Descend dragons and summon rain,
Guide clouds and raise mist.
Ride the light wheel through the skies,
Ascend to the Thearch’s dawn.

Conclude by gazing upward and swallowing the Five Qi in proper order.

After nine years of practice, the Lord of Mount Heng will descend to bestow upon you a black dragon cloud chariot, provide Jade Persons as Immortal Officials, and summon the spirit medicines of the Northern Direction. You will gain insight into the yet-unmanifested affairs of the Northern Direction, as well as the omens of fortune and misfortune. After eighteen years, you will fly and ascend to the Highest Clarity.

Here ends Scroll Ninety-Two of *The Supreme Secret Essentials*
Scroll Ninety-Three of *The Supreme Secret Essentials*: *Ascending to the Highest Clarity, Lesser Grade*

In the third summer month, the Nine Primordials of the Supreme Void Sovereign transform into nine suns, layered and conjoined, their radiance streaming and shining to illuminate the Highest Clarity. Meditate upon them to return to your true form.

To cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Void Sovereign, always on the winter solstice, enter your chamber, face north, and prostrate to the Void Sovereign. Upon completion, strike your teeth thrice, and visualize the Void Sovereign following the four seasons’ forms and appearances within the Northern Primordial Mansion of the Seven Treasures Palace in the Jade Clarity, turning true illumination downward to enter the twin dark gates of your numinous chamber. Then recite the incantation:

"Mysterious quiescence pervades the subtle,
Essence scatters from the Void Sovereign.
Three Primordials merge as one,
Flying immortals stream with light.
Divine youths bathe and irrigate,
Jade maidens disperse fragrance.
Primordial Father exchanges blessings,
Fortune and longevity befall me.
Eight luminaries lend their wings,
Five Elders descend to my chamber.
I behold the supreme numina,
Meet the countenance of the Immortal King.
Eternally partaking of boundless grace,
I soar aloft to the Great Void.
Light feathers carry me in flight,
Ascending to enter the Highest Palace."

Upon completion, tilt your head back and swallow ten breaths of qi to conclude.

This is the Mysterious Quiescence Supreme Dao, concealed within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies of the Most High. According to the statutes, it is revealed once in ten thousand kalpas, secretly transmitted to those destined to become Highest Clarity immortals. Those who attain it become divine immortals, practicing the Highest Clarity Dao.

The esoteric name and character of the qi of the Nine Primordials of the Supreme Void Sovereign, the Primordial Flying Sovereign, measures fifty million zhang in length. In the third winter month, he wears a flying celestial purple crown, robes of five-colored patterned cloth and tiger fur, bears flowing golden bells, and girds intertwined spirit white sashes. He stands upon a dark turtle amidst dark clouds, his radiance resplendent, brightly illuminating the Highest Clarity. Meditate upon him to return to a length of five cun and five fen.

In the third spring month, the Nine Primordials of the Supreme Void Sovereign transform into an old man, wearing a yellow kerchief and a robe of dark feathers, holding a halberd, standing upon purple clouds. Meditate upon him to return to your true form.

In the third autumn month, the Nine Primordials of the Supreme Void Sovereign transform into a radiance of yellow and black, their brilliance gleaming to illuminate the north. This is the returning of the mysterious quiescent qi, further refining the essence of the Primordial Flying Sovereign. Meditate upon him to return to your true form.

*—Excerpted from *The Cavernous Perfection Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Transformations**

On the vernal equinox, when the moon lodges above the Metal Gate, there lies the Gate of Spiritual Communion. At that time, the moon refines within the pool of metal essence, tempered by the Stone Radiance Water Mother, burnished within the splendor of floral light. On this day, the yang essence is bathed in the Metal Gate, and the yellow qi is received in the Jade Spring. The Supreme Perfected and all celestial beings gather the blossoms of the *qian* tree on this day to brush the light of the sun and moon. The moon bathes the countenances of celestial beings with yellow qi, thus on the vernal equinox, the myriad qi harmonize in warmth, divine radiance conjoins in harmony—this is the time when yellow qi and yang essence descend to meet.

To seek the Dao of immortality, on the vernal equinox at dusk, enter your chamber, face west, recline upon your seat at ease, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize the Green Radiance Lady of the Moon, whose esoteric name and character measure nine cun in length. She wears her hair in a cascading cloud coiffure, dons a flying cloud skirt of green brocade, and holds the moon’s light in her mouth, descending to enter above your two eyes. In an instant, the moonlight scatters into yellow qi, flowing to suffuse your entire form. The lady stands at the moon’s center, gathering blossoms from the *qian* grove and scattering them amidst the yellow qi. She exhales the red qi of yang essence to pour into your form, raining from within to without. The yellow and red qi intertwine, illuminating your entire body. The lady transmits to you six cinnabar characters in purple script, then leads you to swallow twenty-four breaths of yellow qi and sixteen breaths of yang essence to conclude. Strike your teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

"Eightfold refining in the metal crucible,
Cinnabar pool vast and deep.
Jade nectar surges in torrents,
Flowing to bathe the eight *qian*."

The yellow qi swells and ascends, the yang essence congeals into mist. Plucking blossoms in the orchid court, her flying skirts flutter in profusion. The lady rinses with fragrance, the august sovereign pours forth the fluid. The gentle radiance melts in season, the intercalary rains fall upon the heavens. The cinnabar brilliance shines in eightfold clarity, its luminous purity pervading all. Reflected and refracted, it descends upon my form. United with the moon’s essence, I shall long preserve my numinous years. Riding the void and steering the floating, I reach the realm beyond intervals.

Cease after swallowing the qi twenty-four times and the saliva sixteen times, then ingest the six cinnabar characters in purple script. Practicing this Way for eight years, the lady will confer upon you the true sounds of the cinnabar characters and the flying blossoms of the moon to brush your form. Your countenance will assume a golden aspect, and you will soar through the Upper Clarity.

The cinnabar characters in purple script and the hidden sounds of the moon’s essence are inscribed upon the trees of the *qian* grove in the moon’s eastern realm—upon their leaves form the writings of spontaneity. Those who ingest these characters shall attain a lifespan of ten thousand years. Though the Way of the Sun and Moon encompasses dozens of methods, this sound remains secret and is not transmitted. Those who recklessly divulge it will suffer the judgment of the wind-knife in this life, their seven ancestors condemned to the ghostly torments of the boundless, enduring the Three Paths and Five Sufferings for ten thousand kalpas without release.

On the autumn equinox at dawn, face east, inscribe the characters in cinnabar upon purple paper, and ingest them. Strike your teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:

"Mysterious radiance, luminous and bright,
Purple qi in resplendent light.
Whirling winds ride the sun,
Four and six in harmony run.
Without, they brush the vermilion blossoms,
Within, they weave the eightfold rays.
The purple Way flows in splendor,
My body brims with ease and fullness.
I ascend the chariot of light,
To reach the imperial hall on high."

Conclude after swallowing the qi twenty-four times. Further, inscribe the cinnabar characters upon a piece of raw purple silk and wear it upon your head. After three years, a purple light three feet in height will emanate from your crown, and you will be attended by six jade maidens who will impart to you the numinous sounds. Those who recklessly divulge this will die and be consigned to the offices of the dead.

Only those whose names are inscribed in gold and whose characters are etched in jade may transmit this to one person in a hundred years. Guard it in secrecy, and you shall become a transcendent, soaring through the Upper Clarity.

For all scholars of the Dao who practice the Way of the Sun and Moon: on the day of the summer solstice at noon, take eight *fen* of true pearls and inscribe the Eightfold Refining Cinnabar Womb Jade Talisman upon yellow paper. Cast it into pure water, face south, bathe, and strike your teeth twenty-four times, softly reciting the incantation as on the day of the spring equinox. Conclude after swallowing the qi eight times. Return to your chamber, burn incense, and blend the elixir with purple powder and various powders to anoint your body. Rub your hands until warm, then wipe your face and entire form. Lie down with your head to the south, strike your teeth nine times, close your eyes, and clench your fists. Visualize the purple qi of the sunlight layering down to suffuse your body. Envision yourself within the sun’s radiance, the sun’s radiance encircling your form, ascending to the Cavern Yang Palace amidst the Azure Forest of the Void and the Courtyard of Flowing Fire. Visualize the Perfected One of the Southern Culmen and Cavern Yang, whose taboo name is Fusion Pearl, standing eight inches tall, clad in a single robe of crimson splendor, wearing the Sun Essence and Pervading Yang Crown upon his head. From his mouth issues forth crimson qi, billowing like flames, to burn your body. In an instant, he plucks the blossoms of the Azure Forest to offer you. After consuming the blossoms, their flavor sweet, you feel warmth suffusing your body. Conclude after swallowing the qi eighty times and softly recite the incantation:

"The sun’s radiance gleams in the net,
Woven with the dark and vast.
Flowing fire surges in abundance,
Ten thousand streams raise their waves.
The Azure Forest swells in verdant profusion,
The golden wings dance in circling motion."

Eightfold refinement of the Vermilion Mother, fragrant zhi serene and harmonious.
Four golden portals unfold, the imperial household’s domain,
where numinous radiance exhales essence, and one gazes upward to sip the flying blossoms.
To the left, dark luxuriance ascends; to the right, the demonic commands are wielded.
The body ascends the high terrace, roaming and gazing upon the verdant expanse.
Eightfold luminaries wing through the clouds, amidst purple jasper and cinnabar mist.
Qi aligns with the Jade Perfected; life matches the numinous branch.
Ever feasting in the Nine Mysteries, the path knows no peril or steepness.

Upon completion, ingest the Eightfold Refined Elixir Embryo Jade Talisman, swallow qi eighty times, and swallow saliva thirty-six times to conclude.

To practice this Way: at dusk, lie down, and from the day of the Beginning of Summer to the Beginning of Autumn, rub the heart with both hands, eighty times on each side. Visualize the sun within the heart and the moon beneath it, their twin lights suffusing the body. Knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

"At dawn I wander the Azure Forest,
at dusk I lodge upon the high terrace.
Flowing fire spans ten thousand fathoms,
receiving the Jade Embryo’s refinement.
The hun soul is at peace, the po soul rejoices,
the myriad spirits radiant and joyous.
The sun’s extremity endures with the moon,
the Three Luminaries unite in harmony."

Upon completion, lie down. Practicing this for eight years, the body shall enter fire yet remain unburnt, the face shall bear a vermilion glow, and one shall converse face-to-face with Fusion Pearl, summoning cinnabar mist to ascend and soar into the Highest Clarity.

The above is from *The Scripture of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence: The Kingly Way of Sequential Practice*.

Above, the twenty-four qi coalesce to form the names of twenty-four palaces, domains, and abodes, establishing the twenty-four August Worthies upon the summit of Jade Clarity, the peak of the Boundless, within the Cavernous Void, and amid the Great Emptiness. The Imperial Lords emerge from the void, their numinous harmony giving rise to the palaces and domains, all coalescing from jade qi to form their titles, aiding the Supreme Prime and Highest Perfected, their luminosity illuminating the Cavernous Brilliance and reflecting upon the Highest Clarity.

On the days of the Beginning of Spring and the Autumn Equinox, the twenty-four August Worthies ingest the qi of incipient generation, refining the true and transforming the spirit, descending into the bodies of the adept and the perfected.

On these days, one must purify and bathe, burn incense, and enter the chamber. First, visualize green qi issuing from the right eye and white qi from the left, the two qi blending and billowing to fill the chamber. Envision the body within these two qi, perceiving the forms of the divine perfected with clarity, scrutinizing their light and color. Then proceed to ingest the qi and recite the incantation.

Focus the mind with unwavering intent, allowing no stray thoughts. Thus, concentration invokes resonance, and precision invokes subtlety, enabling one to turn the purple chariot to fan the void and mount the whirlwind wheels to ascend.

Without the Golden Name and Jade Characters of the Supreme Ultimate, one may not know or perceive its chapters and verses. All are mysteries awaiting their destined convergence, fulfilling ascent to the Highest Immortality. Secrecy invites numinous descent; disclosure invites calamity.

The Supreme Prime disperses the twenty-four qi, transforming them into the Three Divisions, Eight Luminaries, and Twenty-Four Primordial Cavern Spirits, governing the adept’s body below.

Within the Central Palace of the Supreme Prime, the primordial qi likewise transforms and emerges from the void, each accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders to guard and protect the bodily form.

If one preserves the celestial perfected within the silent chamber, meditating upon the divine countenance within the numinous abode, then the Three Eights’ divine hosts shall peacefully guard the palaces and domains. Within a year, the spirits shall manifest, and jade boys and jade maidens shall be at one’s command. Within eight years, the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders shall surely convey the adept’s body upon the Eight Luminaries’ Jade Chariot, flying to ascend the Palace of Highest Clarity.

The Grand Simplicity Three Prime Ladies are the daughters of the One Perfected, and thus the mothers of the Three Simplicity Prime Ladies.

The Grand Simplicity Prime Lady coalesced an empty embryo from the void, emerging from blossoms to be born in the Highest Highest Clarity, the Jeweled Simplicity Nine Mysteries Jade Sovereign Heaven. Her taboo name is Zheng Huiliao, her style Yun Tingying. Upon her head she wears the Jeweled Lang Jade Dawn Feather Crown, draped in a purple qi floating cloud brocade mantle, clad in a nine-colored dragon brocade feathered skirt. At her waist hangs a flowing gold fire bell tiger tally dragon script. She sits amid the Great Emptiness, beneath her knees ever the cinnabar, green, and azure clouds of the Three Simplicities, their qi crowning and veiling the Prime Lady’s body.

To practice the Way of Flying Immortality and wear the script of the Three Primes’ Jade Seal, at midnight within a secluded chamber, face north, close the eyes, knock the teeth three times, and visualize the Grand Simplicity Three Prime Ladies’ attire, taboo names, and styles. Envision them riding the cinnabar, green, and azure Three Simplicities’ whirlwind wheels, descending from the Jade Sovereign Heaven into the chamber. Then bow in reverence to the Prime Ladies and softly recite the incantation:

"Three qi’s primordial essence,
nine heavens’ supreme numina.
Dawn’s radiance gleams bright,
jade blossoms illumine the cavernous.
Three simplicities’ flying whirlwinds,
cinnabar chariots and green chariots.
Eight winds raise the wheels,
flowing reflections in the cloudy court.
Summon the true, attain immortality,
descend into my form.
Supreme wishes prosper,
all endeavors fulfill.
Golden countenance, blossoming visage,
inner palace resplendent.
Eight luminaries support the chariot,
bones fly, flesh light.
Ascend the cinnabar terrace,
pay homage in the Jade Clarity."

Upon completion, swallow qi twenty-four times and cease. Open the eyes and chant the *Lonesome and Desolate Song of the Jade Clarity’s Highest Palace*, harmonizing the body and soul’s qi, rejoicing in the Grand Simplicity’s lofty perfected. The chant:

"The Supreme Prime connects to Jade Clarity,
the Three Luminaries illumine the high and bright.
Eight luminaries turn the morning wind,
dispersing clouds to veil the flying numina.
Round wheels cast into the empty cavern,
golden reflections crown the celestial essence.
Jade blossoms bind the Five Elders,
purple mist propels the cloudy wheels.
Riding qi to sway the mysterious chamber,
yielding and following to transcend the path.
Golden visage gleams with ninefold mist,
jade form leaps in the cold court.
Secluded youths turn in startled gaze,
aged elders return to youthful infancy.
The Imperial One solidifies the mud pill,
the Nine Perfected guard the Yellow Tranquility.
Gazing beyond ten thousand kalpas,
all align with the nine heavens’ overturning."

Upon completion, bow in reverence, swallow saliva three times, and conclude.

The Supreme Perfected Primordial Father coalesced the nine heavens’ jade essence qi, transforming to give birth to the Palace of the Way’s Oneness and the Inner Spirits of the Non-Action Way’s Culmination. The Mysterious Perfected Primordial Mother coalesced the nine yin jade numinous qi, transforming to give birth to the Palace of the Inner Spirits’ Mysterious Culmination and the True Prime’s Central Numinosity.

The two qi govern above in the Nine Heavens’ Culmination Cavern Palace and below in the human body’s Golden Gate, the chambers of yin and yang.

The Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother regularly receive the intermingling void-reflected qi on the days of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) and *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox), dispersing essence to irrigate the numinous, uniting with the Heavenly Origin, refining the Jade Transcendents within, and transforming the bodily perfected below. On these days, all within the heavens is renewed. The foundation of study lies in bathing and purifying oneself on these days, entering the chamber to burn incense, visualizing the forms, taboo names, attire, palaces, and abodes of the Two Perfected, and ingesting the talismans of the yin and yang Perfected. Thus, one secures the spirit palace within the hidden precincts, stabilizes the register within the Primordial Chart, the yang departs from the northern desolate realms, the yin converges in the Golden Cloud Provinces, the two qi intermingle for refinement, and yin and yang unite to support one another. Then the Primordial Beginning inscribes the mandate at the Southern Culmen, the Three Perfected record the writ at Eastern Florescence, the curling incense smoke meanders, and one roams the cliffs of Purple Tenuity. Death’s knot is severed at the Primordial Womb, and the Supreme Perfected are aided in the Hidden Capital. The Eight Effulgences spur the reins, the Three Origins swiftly traverse the void, soaring into the Highest Clarity, transforming into the Great Vacuity—thus the seventy-four directions merge with the bodily abode.

The seventy-four directions of Highest Clarity’s transformations, the Supreme Perfected, are originally named the High Origin’s Supreme Perfected, Luminous Primordial Mysterious Numinous Qi. They coalesce in the Jade Clarity’s Upper Palace of Vermilion Radiance, the Three Simplicities’ Land of Primordial Rectitude, styled the Upper Three Heavens’ Jade Youths with their taboo names. Their heads bear the Three Florets’ Jeweled Effulgence Cavern-Heaven Jade Crowns, they wear azure-yellow sevenfold-transforming brocade robes, gird themselves with the Vermilion Essence’s Celestial Prohibitions, and bear the Seven Luminaries’ Flowing Gold Fire Bells. They govern the Jade Essence Upper Palace, dispersing below the Primordial Nine Ways’ qi, transforming to give birth to the Cavern Transcendents’ Middle Origin Five Yang Cavern Radiance Cavern Culmen Void Upper High Sovereign’s Palace, and below govern the Yellow Longevity Palace within the perfected person’s body.

The Three Heavens’ Jade Youths regularly ingest the Primordial Mysterious Void’s qi on the days of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) and *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox) to refine the perfected and transform the spirit, dispersing the Primordial Nine Ways’ qi to irrigate the bodies of those studying the perfected. To cultivate the Way of Flying Transcendents, one should enter the chamber at dawn, dusk, and midnight on these days, face east, ingest the Supreme Perfected High Origin’s numinous talisman, knock the teeth thrice, close the eyes, and visualize the Three Heavens’ Jade Youths’ taboo names and attire. Riding the Mysterious Void’s qi, they descend into one’s body, merging with the Nine Ways’ qi in a single palace. Then draw in the qi thrice and swallow, silently reciting the incantation:

Vast and boundless, the Mysterious Void,
Golden chamber, jade abode.
Three Numinous initiate the movement,
Six Origins scatter and spread.
Flowing perfected descend,
bestowing upon me the Mysterious Talisman.
Radiance illumines the Eight Circles,
the Way’s clarity broadly supports.
Golden tablets, jade graphs,
purple script, cinnabar writ.
Inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ ranks,
numinous perfected share the same domain.
Descending, the green wheel arrives,
flying clouds, dragon chariot.
Soaring into Highest Clarity,
ascending into the Mysterious Void.
Long preserving kalpas of years,
blessings and felicity overflow.

Upon completion, raise the head and swallow the qi thrice, then cease.

The above is from the *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Directions’ Transformations of the Cavern Perfected*. Examining the Transcendents’ Perfected Writ, it is also named the *Three Origins’ Writ of the Supreme Perfected Yin-Yang Numinous Register*, the Three Heavens’ Nine Numinous Upper Subtle Hidden Text. Heaven and earth possess the great kalpa’s reckoning: after eight thousand kalpas, this writ appears once. The Three Origins’ Mysterious Terrace’s Direct Talismans number three hundred persons, and ninety-one Jade Maidens. Those who bear it—all the spirits of their bodily forms—receive the titles of spontaneous Jade Transcendents. Without this writ, body and spirit do not transform, the defiled soul wanders aimlessly. Wandering without fixity, the spirit intermingles with the demonic, and the time of ashes and ruin arrives. If body and spirit do not transform, one cannot summon the transcendents’ officials, command the Supreme Perfected, or recite the myriad recitations of the Jade Chapters. The myriad recitations of the Jade Chapters are the hidden names of the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Perfected myriad spirits; reciting them startles the Nine Heavens into listening, and the myriad transcendents gird themselves in the east. Without the Transcendents’ Examining Writ, to lightly command the transcendents’ officials and shake the Nine Heavens, the transcendents will not descend, heaven will not receive the resonance, the soul flies and the spirit scatters, the spirit is startled and the qi flees, the palaces and dwellings collapse, the infant is disturbed and lost, heavenly demons bring calamity, and the body is reduced to ashes. Those who possess this writ transcend spontaneously without cultivation; when the Great Peace’s time arrives, they welcome the Sage Lord at the Highest Clarity Palace. Without the Mysterious Chart’s imperial writ, inscribing cinnabar script, one must not rashly transmit it. To frivolously leak the precious writ brings the seven ancestors to account, eternally seals the demonic officials, and dooms one’s own body to perish, unable to enter transcendence.

The Highest Clarity’s Jade Effulgence Cinnabar Numinous Cavern-Heaven High Origin Lord’s Three Origins’ Jade Examining Writ is conferred upon the Highest Clarity Perfected. Bearing it, one roams the various heavens, examines and governs the Great Void, and commands the host of perfected. Those who bear this writ hold rank equal to the Numinous Transcendents; the various heavens respect and protect them, and the Five Thearchs officiate their welcome. After nine years, they attain the Three Origins’ Lord and proceed to the Highest Clarity Palace. To receive this writ, one fasts for nine days. With a green brush, inscribe it upon nine feet of yellow silk, offer it at the sacred peak of one’s life destiny, and then bear it upon the body. If after nine years one has not ascended, offer it again, casting the writ into the azure smoke’s empyrean, and one will attain the Highest Clarity’s Jade Effulgence Palace, where a five-colored cloud chariot is provided to welcome the recipient’s body.

In the first year of the *Qingxu* era, the year *gengyin*, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the Supreme First Direct Dawn Primordial Heavenly Thearch fasted in the Highest Clarity Palace and swore a covenant with the Utmost, Unsurpassed, Colorless, Shadowless, Formless, Nameless, Ancestorless, Clanless, Limitless Cavern Clarity Nine Mysterious Spontaneous Unreckonable Kalpas Dao, conferring the Three Origins’ Jade Examining Writ to examine the Three Heavens’ Jade Youths and transmit it to later students whose mysterious names qualify them as Highest Clarity Perfected, inscribing their names upon the Cinnabar Terrace’s Golden Repository Jade Writs Purple Script Jade Tablets. They welcome the Sage Lord, soaring into the Highest Clarity Palace.

The Grand Simplicity Three Origins’ Lord resides in the Highest Clarity’s Highest Palace, the Vast Numinous Hall, where morning lamps illumine the Jade Perfected, radiant light shines in the Cinnabar Chamber, the Three Florets emit effulgence spontaneously, and the spirit’s brilliance illumines the Nine Mysterious. Felicitous clouds shade the Jade Terrace, flying smoke thickens at the Purple Pavilion, the Mysterious Chart is displayed in the Upper Hall, the Five Talismans are ordered in the Womb Honored, the Three Origins are arrayed in the Grand Simplicity, and the Register of Life is governed at the Jade Gate. The lofty pavilion stands desolate, uniquely delighting in the wondrous abyss. Emerging to roam the empyrean observatory, the sun and moon incline their radiance, torches are arrayed to uproot the origin, the eight winds reverse their waves, the whirlwind surges through the hidden source, jade effulgence illumines brightly, the high empyrean dances at dawn, crimson auroras thickly spread, yellow clouds coil sevenfold, the Five Elders open the path, the Supreme Thearch supports the wheel, the Western August wields the tally, the Eastern Florescence raises the banner, and the Nine Heavens tremble.

Amidst the vastness of non-action, mist arises—subtle qi shrouds in obscurity, the Eight Effulgences brush away dust. Gazing upward, one beholds the Net of the Supreme; looking about, one encompasses the Hundred Circles. This may indeed be called the loftiest of the Perfected Real, the unfathomable subtlety of wondrous transformation.

*(From the* Dongzhen Yujian Jing *[The Scripture of Jade Tallies of the Cavern Real])*

This is the method of Flowing Rosy Clouds Opening the Inner Vision of the Jade Talisman: facing east, write in vermilion on white paper, then strike the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

Nine Paths of the Grand Yang,
Eight Perfected unite in radiance.
Three and Five revolve in transformation,
Merging with the cinnabar spirit.
Stone Effulgence, Jade Womb,
Essence of vermilion cinnabar.
Gather and receive the soaring mystery,
Descend to enter my form.
Ever with the Three Dawns,
Together in death, together in life.

Conclude by casting the talisman into the Water Mother of Stone Effulgence.

*(From the* Shangqing Yuxia Ziying Neiguan Shangfa *[The Supreme Clarity Method of the Purple Radiance of Jade Rosy Clouds in Inner Vision], also titled* Jinjing Shijing Shuimu Yubao Jing *[The Scripture of the Jade Womb of the Water Mother of Stone Effulgence and Golden Essence], or* Caifu Rigen Zhaoxia zhi Dao *[The Way of Gathering and Ingesting the Root of the Sun to Summon Rosy Clouds])*

Regularly, on the first day of the waxing moon, gather three *sheng* of the yellow essence of the Eastern Well—*jinghua* (well-florescence, i.e., water)—and place it in a golden vessel, which is also excellent. Set it in the central courtyard. On the night of the sixteenth day of the lunar month at midnight, when the mysterious radiance of the moon’s essence shines upon the yellow essence, the adept faces east and inscribes the Talisman of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence of Cavernous Clarity, then casts it into the vessel of yellow essence. Turning to face west, strike the teeth twenty-four times and intone the invocation to the lunar spirit, twenty-four words in all. Conclude by closing the eyes and visualizing the five-colored flowing essence and purple radiance of the moon descending to bathe the adept’s body, suffusing the entire form.

Visualize within the moon a perfected person, nine *cun* in height, wearing a purple crown and clad in a flying robe of yellow brocade, descending to stand above the adept’s head. This being draws the yellow essence of the moon into the adept’s form, then leans over the vessel of yellow essence, reflecting the moonlight while softly reciting the incantation:

Spirit unfurls its radiant bloom,
Three and Five pervade in clarity.
Purple and yellow intermingle in descent,
Dual qi merge as one.
Celestial origins part and unite,
Cycles turn in waxing and waning.
Imperial mushrooms overflow,
Yellow womb congeals its essence.
Perfected within the effulgence,
Wash and bathe my form.
Lady of the Moon,
Secure my yellow tranquility.
Golden bells and jade pendants,
Render me utterly luminous.
With the moon I wane,
With the moon I wax.
Ever ingesting yellow essence,
Ascend to the imperial court.
Roam the Great Void,
Govern the flying wheel.
Supreme offering without end,
Lifespan of myriad kalpas.

Conclude by facing the moon and swallowing twenty-four times. Then, using the yellow essence, wash the eyes toward the moon and bathe the entire body. Finally, release any remaining essence into an eastward-flowing river.

After practicing this for nine years, the eyes perceive the vast emptiness, clearly seeing ten thousand miles. One reverses inquiry into fortune and misfortune, refines the countenance to transform the body, the face radiates jade essence, and the body emits purple light. Riding the void and mounting emptiness, one soars into the Upper Clarity. The Three Passes unlock their mechanisms, the Nine Portals receive the numinous. The face shines with golden countenance, the Five Viscera flourish in splendor. The Golden Perfected unfolds in harmony, the Falling Vastness becomes utterly luminous. The divine candle illumines in hidden radiance, treasure light arises at night. Flowing gold intermingles in casting, the resplendent fire bells blaze. With a whistle, commands are instantly fulfilled; one drives and directs the divine soldiers. The Three Primes arrive at the chamber, descending to summon the Green Wheel. Riding the void and mounting emptiness, one ascends into the Upper Clarity.

—Excerpted from *The Supreme Lord of Radiance’s Purple Reflection Inner Contemplation Upper Method*

Here ends Scroll Ninety-Three of *The Supreme Secret Essentials*
Scroll Ninety-Four of *The Supreme Secret Essentials*: Ascending the Great Void

The Upper Clarity Golden Palace Numinous Writ and Purple Text teaches the ingestion of solar effulgences and flying roots to disperse and unbind the knots of death, preserve and congeal the Mud Pill, blend the generative forces of yin and yang, secure the hun and nourish the shen. The body attains the Jade Emperor’s essence, and the qi merges with the Three Luminaries.

This method of swallowing qi was formerly received from the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It is also called *The Scripture of Cinnabar Elixir, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother, and Jade Embryo*.

One should regularly await the moment of sunrise, face east toward the sun, and click the teeth nine times. Upon completion, silently invoke the names of the solar soul and the five emperors within the sun:

Solar soul, Pearl Radiance,
Illuminating and enveloping the green glow,
Crimson Lad of Returning Radiance,
Mysterious Flame and Whirlwind Image.

After silently invoking these sixteen characters, close the eyes and clench the fists. Visualize the five-colored streaming radiance within the sun all coming to embrace the body, descending to the two feet. Then visualize the five qi ascending to the crown of the head. Thereupon, the sunlight and streaming radiance of five colors all enter the mouth. Within the sunlight and radiance, there is also a purple qi, large as the pupil of the eye, layered in tens, gleaming and resplendent amid the five lights. These are called the Flying Roots of Solar Effulgence and the Water Mother of the Jade Embryo. Together with the five qi, they enter the mouth. Facing the sun, swallow the radiance forty-five times. After swallowing the qi, swallow saliva nine times. Then click the teeth nine times and softly invoke:

Cinnabar furnace, elixir qi,
Spherical heaven nurtures essence.
Firmness receives softness,
Flame and water’s yin flower.
Solar origin, morning radiance,
Named the Great Illumination.
Nine yangs transform in unison,
Dual mists arise together.
Congealing the hun and harmonizing the marvel,
The essence of the five qi.
Within, the Five Emperors are born,
Shedding light to govern the form.
Gathering the flying in emptiness,
Plucking the root to attain fullness.
The head is crowned with dragon blossoms,
Adorned with crimson and girded with azure.
The bridle bird flows in mystery,
Radiance reflects the Upper Clarity.
Bestowed the jade tablet script,
Name engraved in the golden palace.
Ingesting the morning effulgence,
Uniting with the Perfected in numinosity,
Flying immortal of the Grand Tenuity,
Ascending to the Purple Court.

After the invocation, bow twice toward the sun. Among a million true immortals, not one knows the name of the solar soul. This Dao is profoundly wondrous; it cannot be heard by those who consume putrid food and foul corpses. On overcast days without sun, one may perform this in a secluded chamber at a clean place outside. Refined Daoist practitioners who are adept at upper resonance may cultivate this without awaiting the sun. If a disciple abstains from grains in the mountains and forests, maintains perpetual purification on the Five Peaks, severs worldly ties, and dwells afar in contemplation of purity, they may daily ingest the solar root’s radiance and swallow the essence of the Great Yang. Then the body will generate jade luster, and the face will bear flowing light. If one is entangled in worldly affairs, has not attained bodily stillness, drifts along worldly paths, and the heart is bound in entangling nets, one should perform this on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, totaling ten times in a month, following the method above. On these days, the solar soul descends to connect with the flying roots, filling the Water Mother and Jade Embryo. After practicing for eighteen years, the Three Primes of the Jade Clarity and Grand Simplicity will refine one with golden perfection, illumine one with jade light, and confer the rank of Jade Emperor, enabling flight through the Great Void.

—Excerpted from *The Cavern-Real Numinous Writ of Purple Text*

*The Purple Writ Formula* states: Those who cultivate the Dao of the Supreme Perfected should practice the Upper Clarity Jade Radiance Purple Reflection Inner Contemplation Upper Method. Regularly on the first day of one’s birth decade, bathe, purify, and fast. Wear clean ritual garments, enter the chamber at dawn, and use the Inner Contemplation Luminous Jade Talisman’s pure effulgent water to wash the eyes facing east, and rinse the mouth and intestines, ensuring inner and outer clarity and emptiness. The mouth should have no lingering flavors, the abdomen no residual warmth, the eyes no extraneous sights, the body no remaining dust. Serene, pure, and silent, the self is solely the Dao. Then turn to face south, sit upright, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize purple qi emerging from the top of the head, vigorously filling the heavens. The qi bathes one’s form, both inside and out, in dense obscurity. Then draw in the purple qi and swallow it thirty-nine times, the qi following each swallow into the mouth and abdomen. After swallowing, open the eyes to a state of clear brightness, click the teeth three times, and look up to invoke:

Upper Clarity streaming radiance,
Dawn announces the true effulgence.
Purple clouds reflect the numinous,
Radiant essence intermingles and blazes.
Inwardly infusing the golden gate,
The jade portal receives the irrigation.
Treasure spirits conceal their radiance,
Hun and po do not scatter.
Illustrious Sovereign of the Nine Perfected,
Eight Dao’s flowing brilliance.
Grasping clouds to summon emptiness,
Numinous descent from the River of Stars.
Penetrating the dark origin,
The Three Dawns feast in unison.
Roaming and ascending the jade chamber,
Bowing above in the imperial palace.

Afterward, look up and swallow three times. This Inner Contemplation Luminous Jade Talisman should be written in vermilion on white paper and cast into water. Facing east, click the teeth three times and invoke:

Heaven has no flying obscurities,
Earth has no drifting dust.
The jade talisman scours filth,
Washing away the inauthentic.
The cavernous luminous emptiness
Summons and attracts the numinous immortals.

After the invocation, use the water to wash the eyes, rinse the mouth, and cleanse inside and out. Discard the remaining talisman water into an eastward-flowing stream.

This method originates from the middle chapter of the *Highest Clarity Jade Radiance Purple Reflection Inner Contemplation Scripture*. After eight years of practice, purple clouds will shroud the adept’s body, the eyes will gain penetrating clarity to perceive the Nine Heavens, the body will emit wondrous light, and one’s luminous form will transform myriad times, soaring through the Great Void.

—From the *Cavern Realms Azure Essentials Purple Writings of the Upper Scripture*

In the twelfth month, one receives the qi of the Brahma Treasure Heaven. On the third day of the month at dawn, the thirteenth at noon, and the twenty-third at midnight—three days and three times each month—bathe in fragrant water, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Bow nine times to the Primordial Father in the northwest, then three times to the Mysterious Mother in the southeast. Return to face the lunar mansion, sit upright, and click the teeth thirty-six times. With eyes closed, visualize and invoke the name of the Brahma Treasure Heavenly King. After three years of this practice, the bones will transform into jade, the spirit will rejoice, and qi will overflow. One will retroactively know future events before they occur. After nine years, the form will change, and one will soar through the Great Void.

—From the *Cavern Realms Nine Elixirs Upper Transformation Embryonic Essence Record*

The Eight Simplicities Flying Essence Twofold Luminous Jade Scripts arise within the Cavernous Void, manifesting atop Tortoise Mountain’s summit, above the Dark Garden, and in the shade of the Accumulated Stones. They govern the myriad qi and command all heavens. The sun and moon conceal their scripts, hidden above the Nine Heavens, transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. Those who obtain these numinous scripts will share the same lifespan as the sun and moon, transforming freely to exit existence and enter non-existence. A purple light will crown their heads, their faces will radiate golden countenance, the ten thousand spirits will bow in reverence, and the Ten Heavens will unite in welcome. After nine years of practice, one will ascend and soar through the Great Void.

—From the *Cavern Realms Eight Simplicities True Scripture*

Refine the Nine Origins True Talismans from golden essence and stone marrow. To escape the peril of the Blade Mountains, on one’s life-day, write them in white on blue paper and ingest them. After three years, past sins will vanish, and true spirits will descend. After nine years, one will succeed in riding a dragon to traverse the void, soaring through the Great Void.

—From the *Cavern Realms Four Poles Luminous Regulations*

**Ascending the Purple Tenuity Palace Section**

The Yellow Water Moonflower Elixir: Gather and consume its blossoms, drink one sheng of yellow water, and one’s form will divide into ten thousand transformations. The eyes’ light will become bright moons, floating through the Great Void, soaring into the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace.

—From the *Cavern Realms Numinous Writings Purple Texts of the Upper Scripture*

The **Middle True Upper Origin Yin-Yang Transformation Two Talismans**: Write the upper talisman in vermilion and the lower in ink. Before the Summer Solstice, ingest the lower talisman first, then the upper; before the Winter Solstice, ingest the upper first, then the lower. When taking the talismans, click the teeth three times and softly recite:

Yin and yang harmonize their transformations,
The two qi flow unimpeded.
The Primordial Father guards authenticity,
The Mysterious Mother protects the palace.
The two spirits intermingle and change,
The Dao shines with radiant fullness.
The Eight Primes sprinkle the mysterious,
My Dao expands boundlessly.
The Three Departments merge their luminosities,
Transformations know no limit.
The numinous talisman halts aging,
Jade qi restores youth.
Lifespan equals kalpa’s span,
Enduring as the eternal heavens.

After reciting, swallow eight qi. After eight years of practice, the Eight Luminous Spirit Officials will serve as the adept’s charioteers, ascending to the Purple Tenuity Palace.

The **Middle True Upper Origin Yang-Born Bing-Zi Transformation Talisman**: This Upper Origin Jade Gate Yang Spirit’s essence generates jade scripts to assist the Middle True High Clarity, transforming the qi of the eight directions, communicating with spirits, summoning the true, and preserving life for eternity. After eight years of ingestion, eight Jade Lads from the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace will attend the adept, summoning the Eight Luminous Cloud Chariots to welcome the adept’s ascent to the Purple Tenuity Palace.

—From the *Cavern Realms Seventy-Four Methods of Transformation Scripture*

The **Purple Tenuity Numinous Capital True Talisman’s Ancient Text** originates from the *Highest Supreme Transformation Cavernous Void Third Jade Luminance Chapter*, concealed within the Purple Tenuity Palace. For all who practice the Dao to seek immortality, contemplate spirits, preserve authenticity, repent sins, resolve transgressions, and aspire to the grace of the Five Emperors and host of immortals, on the Summer Solstice, write the text in vermilion, face south, and ingest three talismans. All sins will be eradicated, the Five Emperors will protect and recommend, and one’s name will be recorded in the Cinnabar Chamber. After three years of practice without fail, the Purple Tenuity will assign eight Jade Lads. Through concentrated visualization and resonance, the Five Emperors will descend in form, bestowing the Three Luminous Jade Chariots to carry the adept in flight, ascending to the Purple Tenuity Palace.

—From the *Cavern Realms Numinous True Eight Dao Jade Luminance Hidden Talismans*

**Ascending the Purple Court Section**

The Highest Sage Lord said: To inscribe one’s name on the Western Tortoise Mountain and ascend to the Sevenfold Radiance Chamber, on the seventh day of the seventh month at the hour of Upper Union, bathe in purity and fast. At dusk, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times to the Jade Emperor facing north. Afterward, face north, click the teeth twelve times, and visualize within the fasting chamber a white, plain cloud arising in luxuriant abundance, filling the entire room. Envision the Five Elder Immortals within the plain cloud, draped in flying azure robes, crowned with Heaven-Penetrating Jade Diadems, holding green-scripted registers. Visualize the Immortal Jade Gentlemen wearing cloud-brocade robes, crowned with Seven Treasures Jade Diadems, holding silver tablets. See the two perfected ones inscribe your name upon the silver tablet, binding the record within the green-scripted volume. Hand your inscribed tablet to the Supervising Perfected Envoy to register among the Left Immortals, then memorialize the Nine Heavens’ Emperors and Seven Sages’ mechanisms to confirm your name. The Five Elder Immortals and Immortal Jade Gentlemen will transform and enter your body’s Primordial Simplicity Palace. Softly recite:

Heaven’s blessings universally descend,
Upper Union unites the ten thousand spirits.
The Great Void records names,
Eastern Florescence engraves the volume.
Bound with green records,
Inscribed on silver tablets.
Four rhymes unite as one,
Harmonious tones perfect the true.
The Highest Sage transmits the mysterious,
To deliver my body.
The two qi descend to fill,
Revolving the Nine Heavens’ mists.
Transformed into Immortal Elders,
Jade Gentlemen and perfected unite.
Eight Luminances bear the chariot,
Ascending to the Imperial Dawn.
Pay homage to the Highest Sages,
Fortune and blessings coil ninefold.
Eternally preserve the Three Luminaries,
Heaven and earth share the same lifespan.

After reciting, bow seven times to the Seven Sages and swallow seven qi.

To practice this Dao, the Mother of Tortoises records one’s name, the Eastern Florescence inscribes it, and the Three Origins descend to ascend one to the Purple Court.
*(From the* Scripture of the Primordial Record of the Seven Sages of the Cavernous Truth.*)*

The Cloud-Opening Talisman of the Jade Luminance of Yin and Yang is written in cinnabar on green paper and ingested, or written in cinnabar on green silk and worn.
These are the essences of the Two Luminaries of the sun and moon. To know the essence of the Two Luminaries is to conceal one’s luminance and hide one’s form.
Practicing this for eighteen years, one ascends to the Purple Court.
*(From the* Scripture of the Seven Transformations and Seven Changes of the Divine Continent’s Dance of Heaven.*)*

**Ascending to the Purple Void Rank**

The Supreme Perfected transmits the secret Dao of summoning the Five Celestial Bodies in the Cavern Chamber to the South Pole Primordial Lord.
At midnight, in stillness, one may sit or lie as one wishes. Compose the body, quiet the mind, relax the qi, and harmonize the spirit.
With eyes closed, inwardly visualize the Great White Star of the West above the two eyes on the face, called the Jade Earrings of the Purple Gate.
Next, visualize the Star of the Northern Dipper in the Celestial Center, the Imperial Realm, the Mysterious Palace, ascending from above the nose to five fen within the hairline, one cun deep.
Next, visualize the Wood Star of the East at the Crimson Terrace of the Cavern Pass, one cun behind the eyes, one cun deep.
Next, visualize the Fire Star of the South at the inner canthus of the Jade Eyes, five fen deep.
Next, visualize the Earth Star of the Center in the Golden Treasury of the Yellow Chamber, the Long Valley. The Golden Treasury of the Yellow Chamber lies two fen deep at the center of the philtrum, with the star suspended above like an ornament.
Once all visualizations are complete, perceive the stars occupying their positions, awakening so that the Five Stars emit their radiance, casting five-colored mists that penetrate one’s entire body, illuminating both within and without.
If the body feels warm and suffused, it is the entry of the stellar essences.
Then, knock the teeth five times, and swallow saliva twenty-five times.
Softly recite:

The Lofty Purple Gate,
Within dwell the Five Spirits.
Precious luminaries unfold their splendor,
Radiance surging through the gates.
Essence transforms and accumulates,
Changing into an Elder.
Head wrapped in white, countenance serene,
Green mantle, crimson skirt.
On the right, flowing bells,
On the left, the Tiger Perfected.
Holding the Celestial Steel,
Scattering crimson flying stars.
Feet treading the Floral Canopy,
Spitting radiance to refine the body.
The Three Luminaries guard and preserve,
Enabling me to attain perfection.
Nurturing the po, restraining the hun,
Riding the whirlwind to fly as an immortal.

After completion, those who practice this for fifteen years will be met thus:
The Crimson Mound Supreme Perfected of the South Pole Elder welcomes with a chariot of green clouds;
The White Spirit Master of the West Pole welcomes with a carriage of yellow whirlwinds;
The Mystic Supreme Immortal Sovereign of the North Pole welcomes with a dragon of dark luminance;
The Supporting Yang Lord of the East Pole welcomes with a palanquin of blue-green paired steeds;
The Central Origin Elder, the Supreme Mystery Master of the Center, welcomes with a canopy of winding dawn.
The Five Elders unite as one, together ascending to the Purple Void.

The *Ascending to the Purple Dawn* Chapter

For those who practice the Seven Cycles and Seven Transformations of the Divine Dance of the Celestial Realm within the Sacred Continent, twenty-one Jade Lads and twenty-one Jade Maidens are commanded to serve. They traverse the Five Marchmounts, bearing the Dark-Network Azure-Furred Standards, riding Azure-Luminance Dragons, wearing Tiger Talismans of Spirit, crowned with Hibiscus Wreaths, clad in Purple-Embroidered Feather Mantles and Cinnabar-Green Flying Skirts. They ring the True Bells of Gold and Jade, raise Purple Canopies and Florid Banners, and bear the Nine Crimson-Speckled Talismans to seal mountains and summon clouds, ascending to wander within the Golden Hall of the Purple Ultimate.

If one has not yet attained the transformation of luminous ascent to the heavens, they remain among mortals. Those who cultivate this Way shall be granted by the Nine Heavens’ Parents, the Supreme August Purple Dawn, the raiment of flying immortals and feathered regalia for their bodies—though these shall not manifest amid the clamor of the dusty world. When you practice this Way, you must simply visualize yourself clad in these sacred vestments, riding dragons and commanding clouds. After seven years, you shall attain the true numinous form and ascend to the Purple Dawn.

The Supreme August Lord of the Purple Dawn, Master of the Primordial Dawn, is the descendant of the Twin Radiance, the essence congealed from the Jade Dawn. He nurtures dragon mists in the Great Void, enfolds the Purple Emptiness to commune with spirits, entrusts the Nine Mysteries to contain brilliance, coalesces the Vast Dew to form his spirit, and refines the Three Qi to bathe himself. Having passed through the Dark Mother to achieve dharma-birth, he endures kalpas of transformation, moved by the sun’s proclamations to reveal his luminous form.

Thus, in the first year of the Supreme August Era, when Heavenly Stem Jia inaugurated the dawn, he was born upon the Central Plain of the Eight Luminances within the Divine Continent, by the shores of the Cavernous Abyss. His name was tabooed as *Bodi*, his style called *Tiger*□. On the day of his birth, his face radiated a golden countenance, his body gleamed with jade light, his five-colored purple regalia shimmered, and his seventy-two transformations dazzled with jade-like brilliance. Divine dragons spat fungi to nourish him, phoenixes and simurghs spread their wings to shade his mystery. Cinnabar spirits scattered luminance upon his jasper terrace, while flowing light blazed resplendently in the distant truth.

The twin luminaries paused their radiance amid the Eight Clarities,
the Seven Primes revolved their essence to uphold the dawn.
Golden Immortals scattered incense to mingle with the qi,
divine consorts cast blossoms to kindle mist.
The Five Wefts wove their patterns,
spiritual splendor suffused the purple heavens.
At eighteen years of age, he roamed freely in the Middle Prime,
ingesting essence and swallowing qi,
exhaling and inhaling numinous fluids.
He consumed fungi to inwardly irrigate,
congealed spirit to gestate as an embryonic immortal.
Drawing in and rinsing, he maintained silence,
abiding in tranquil spontaneity.
His thoughts subtle, his mindfulness of qi unbroken,
he accumulated resonance with the Cavernous Prime,
his name transcending the Upper Clarity.
He received the title of Primordial August,
his rank ascending to the Purple Dawn.
Orchid phoenixes responded to auspicious omens,
following the flow of destiny’s transformations.
His spirit embraced the Five Luminaries,
his form coiled with the Seven Primes.
He soared through the firmament, wheels revolving,
riding the void to descend in trailing mist.
The host of immortals opened the path,
the Three Ways converged in brilliance.
Forked lightning spat its might,
his swift chariot traversed the Nine Primes.
Twice he ascended the jasper steps,
thrice he paid homage at the Purple Court.
He wandered and gazed upon the jasper towers,
feasting in the radiance of the Three Primes.
In fellowship with the Five Elders,
he became an honored guest of the Jade Empyrean.
Flying beasts crouched and reared,
divine phoenixes soothed with their cries.
Mighty dragons guided the reins,
spirit winds dispersed fragrance.
Flowing scents surged and billowed,
pervading the Jade Clarity.
Golden lads grasped clouds to attend his wheels,
jade maidens trod the void to guard his spirit.

Eastward he journeyed to the Azure Waters and Mulberry Grove Pavilion,
to the Cavernous Abyss’s vast numinous utmost clarity,
the source of the Sun Valley’s Divine King and Sovereign of Immortals,
where he sought the Nine Primes’ Primordial Chart,
the luminous chapters of the Nine Transformations of Azure Essence and Verdant Clouds,
and the solar radiance of Dawn’s Clarity,
to refine his true form and roam the Grotto-Heavens’ upper palaces.

Westward he traveled to the Mystic Feathered Wilds,
the banks of the Western Dragon’s Vast Expanse,
to the Purple Tenuity’s Jasper Hall and the Queen Mother of the West,
where he sought the Pristine Luminous Chapters,
the Primordial Register of Tortoise Mountain,
and the Jade Standard of True Refinement,
to meditate upon the title of the Purple August.

Southward he ventured to the Vermilion Mound’s Great Cinnabar,
the ultimate fiery realm of scorching flames,
the Nine-Tiered Jasper Terrace of the Grand Yang’s Luminous Palace,
to the Southern Culmen’s Upper Prime Lord,
where he sought the Great Cinnabar’s Cavernous Prime,
the Flame Bell’s Seven Luminaries’ Jasper Chapters,
and the Golden True Jade Radiance,
to summon the twin luminaries’ jade essence
and refine his sevenfold-transformed countenance.

Northward he journeyed to the Dark Yin’s Nine Primes’ frigid realm,
where the Grand Yin’s Jade Dawn’s Nine Prime True Consort
received the Flowing Essence’s Flying Radiance Treasure Chapters,
the desolate Nine Luminaries’ vast expanse,
and the Seven Primes’ effulgence,
to part the Celestial Pass,
attend the banquet in the Jade Palace,
and ascend the soaring peaks of the Primordial Heaven’s
Jade Capital’s towering terrace and Nine-Bend Chambers.
There, the Supreme Perfected Elder and the Most High Great Dao Lord
bestowed the Three Heavens’ Orthodox Dharma,
commanding the Six Heavens’ might,
receiving the Nine Crimson Flying Essence Chapters,
and donning the flowing gold phoenix seal.
His rank ascended to the Purple Dawn.

Thus, the August Supreme Master’s numinous radiance and resplendent visage,
his golden countenance and joyful mien,
were crowned with dharma robes.
Upon his head he wore the seven-hued crown of Purple Script and Flying Frost,
attended by ten billion immortal maidens and countless immortals.
Flying dragons and venomous beasts guarded his jasper carriage.
Night shone with natural divine candles,
chambers diffused the mist of empty fragrance.
Winds stirred the dark banners,
whirling dances swirled in profusion.
His whistling clear, vast and boundless,
jade tones resonated with the celestial pipes.

Empty chants and soaring hymns,
eight echoes harmonize in response.
Phoenixes cry and phoenixes pipe,
pure melodies play the dark celestial flutes.
Mysterious essence curves reflect,
the Three Dawns pause their canopies.
Myriad Perfected offer rites of celebration,
none but revere and rely upon him.

He upholds the divine precincts of the Nine Provinces,
roams the boundless, desolate halls,
rectifies the destiny of the Three and Five,
rescues and transforms the calamities of the Tang succession.
He governs the Two Modes within the Dark Diagram,
unites the legacy of the August Supreme.

In tranquil recitation within the jasper carriage,
he gazes downward, contemplating the profound.
Lush and verdant, the Three Passes,
hidden verses unfold their cadence.
In unison they chant the Dark Portals,
illuminating the model that elicits praise.
Empty tones race one another,
cavernous wisdom shines brilliantly,
stirring the Eight Winds to swift motion,
seizing the streaming lightning to radiate essence.

He summons the Six Jia within the Five Phases,
commands the martial legions of Heavenly Soldiers.
He seals the Five Peaks to await his chariot,
issues thunderous proclamations to shake the numinous.
Transforming the dance of Heaven upon the divine continent,
revolving the Seven Turns within the wondrous court.
He invokes the Void and None to cleanse himself,
ingests jade talismans to ascend in form.
He casts the celestial patterns upon sun and moon,
directs the Seven Qi through the Dipper stars.

Thus, drifting across the Nine Realms,
the Noble Scions share his carriage,
the Directors of Destiny align their wheels,
roaming and feasting in the Purple Dawn,
encompassing the Cavernous Abyss,
governing all immortals.
From Heaven downward, none fail to receive his charge
through the Dao of the Seven Transformations.

Wondrous indeed, the Dao of the Seven Turns and Seven Transformations.
The August Supreme Purple Dawn Lord received it from the Nine Heavens’ Parents,
cultivated and perfected the Dao,
and transmitted it to the August Supreme Lord of the Dark Heaven.
The August Supreme Lord transmitted it to the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens,
the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens transmitted it to the Purple Ultimate Perfected Primordial Lord,
the Purple Ultimate Perfected Primordial Lord transmitted it to the Heavenly Thearch,
the Heavenly Thearch transmitted it to the Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen,
the Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen transmitted it to the Heavenly Thearch of the Grand Tenuity,
the Heavenly Thearch of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Later Sage Lord of the Golden Portals,
the Later Sage Lord of the Golden Portals transmitted it to the Azure Lad of the Grand Minister,
forming a lineage of Perfected Ministers,
each transmission enduring ten thousand kalpas.

The Lesser Existence Heavenly King later compiled one copy,
sealing it within the mountains of the Western Regions.
Those who obtain it all welcome the Sage Lord to the Upper Clarity Palace,
providing twenty-one Jade Lads and twenty-one Jade Maidens each,
to safeguard the numinous texts
and protect the bodies of those who possess the scriptures.

The Dao of the Seven Turns of the August Supreme,
written on crimson slips and in purple script,
is concealed within the Jade Chamber of the Purple Heaven Primordial Terrace,
granted only to those who have already attained Perfection,
never taught to beginners.

All who receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Cavernous Perfection, the Feminine One Jade Seal, the Great Existence Wondrous Scripture*,
who unbind knots and disperse stagnation,
who deliver the Seven Mysteries,
yet do not know the method of the Seven Turns,
are not permitted to recite from the Jade Canon.

The verses of the Seven Turns,
all are melodies of the Divine Continent,
tones of the Loftiest,
resonating through Heaven and Earth,
interspersed among the Three Dawns,
revolving left and turning right,
converging at the Cavernous Gates,
transforming Five into Two,
corresponding above to the Seven Primes,
turning Three into Five,
weaving through the Celestial Pass.

Its Dao is most wondrous,
hence it is called the Dance of Heaven.
Reciting one chapter,
its clarity pervades without interruption;
seven turns and eight recitations,
the Three Luminaries unite in Perfection;
the Five Elders fix the registers,
the Directors of Destiny alter the years;
dissolving long-standing knots,
severing the roots of the womb;
opening the Nine Ancestors above,
reversing to return as Womb Immortals;
commanding a thousand demons,
binding ten thousand demons to the body;
cultivating it ten thousand times,
one ascends to the Purple Dawn.

From the *Scripture of the Divine Continent’s Seven Transformations and the Dance of Heaven*,
*Chapter on Ascending the Jade Palace*,
*Inner Incantation of the Grand Thearch, First*.

In a quiet chamber, sit alone facing east, knock the teeth nine times, and with eyes closed, recite the hidden incantation:

*"Vast and numinous Primordial Azure,
Lesser Yang Master of Radiance,
Nine qi return to the liver,
granting my hun-soul peace.
Should any dare transgress,
shatter them with the Flowing Bells.
The Jade Register of the Supreme Thearch—
my name ascends to Great Clarity."*

Conclude, then close the breath for nine cycles, swallowing saliva nine times to finish.

**Second Inner Incantation of the Heavenly Thearch**
Face south, close the eyes, knock the teeth three times, and recite the hidden spell:

*"Palace of Crimson Peaks,
where High Perfected Ones abide.
Three qi return to the heart,
this is my Cinnabar Prime.
Lift my purified body,
directly memorializing to be heard.
In the Verdant Script of the Grand Tenuity—
my name is inscribed among the Divine Immortals."*

Conclude, then hold the breath for three cycles, swallowing saliva three times to finish.

**Third Inner Incantation of the Upper Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen**
Face due west, close the eyes, knock the teeth seven times, and recite the hidden spell:

*"Primal Simplicity pervades the Cavernous Float,
divine abode of Heavenly Perfected Ones.
Seven qi guard the diaphragm,
dwelling with the spirit in unity.
Limpid sincerity, luminous as stone,
roaming and ascending the Mysterious Void.
In White Jade and Golden Script—
the True Writ of the Nine Thearchs.
Let me soar as an immortal,
my name of death already expunged."*

Conclude, then close the breath for seven cycles, swallowing saliva seven times to finish.

**Fourth Inner Incantation of the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity**
Face directly toward the stellar position governing the current year’s fate, close the eyes, knock the teeth twelve times, and recite the hidden spell:

*"Yellow Prime of the Central Thearch,
spirit of my root destiny.
One qi attends the spleen,
enabling me to attain the True.
Yielding to things, they incline—
a thousand spirits come to serve.
In the Mysterious Register of the Venerable Lord—
my name is inscribed among the Divine Immortals.
Long life and enduring vision,
coexisting with Heaven."*

Conclude, then hold the breath for one cycle, swallowing saliva twelve times to finish.

**Fifth Inner Incantation of the Sagely Thearch**
Face north, close the eyes, knock the teeth five times, and recite the hidden spell:

*"Mysterious Prime of the Eight Poles,
mechanism of the Supreme On High.
Five qi defend the kidneys,
tortoise and jade interlocking.
Inscribed on Jade Tablets—
my years equal the Two Modes.
The Supreme Thearch of the Highest Sovereign,
steadfast and unerring.
Commanding the Six Jia,
summoning the Eight Potencies."*

Conclude, then hold the breath for five cycles, swallowing saliva five times to finish.

**Sixth Inner Incantation of the Host of Perfected**
Face east again, visualize the qi of the Five Directions, and when complete, swallow saliva nine times and knock the teeth.

Conclude, then face north and bow twice, reciting the hidden prayer:

*"Reverently I address the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and Great Pole,
entreating the visualization of the Five Directions, Five Thearchs, and Five Numinous Spirits.
Inscribed in emerald script,
they mount the chariot of the Ten Heavens.
Ten thousand demons restrain their qi,
all evil spirits sever their smoke.
May I be granted an audience,
able to converse with them."*

Conclude, then concentrate the mind in refined contemplation.

The Supreme Lord says: *"Those who wish to cultivate the methods of scriptural practices, to visualize the Perfected and guard the One, must first unblock the Three Palaces, illuminate the Nine Orifices, and harmonize the Five Viscera. Without this preparation, the spirits and qi will not rejoice, the true numina will not descend, and one’s refined contemplation will be in vain, yielding no benefit to self-nourishment. Those of sincere aspiration should diligently practice these matters. After reciting the Five Directions’ hidden incantations, return to visualization—when the qi’s governance is harmonized, the inner spirits will delight, and their responsive manifestations will appear clearly, without obstruction."*

Those who earnestly pursue this will surely attain the supreme and wondrous methods of Divine Immortality, for such teachings are not transmitted to the unworthy.

For all who cultivate the Dao of long life and the method of ascending at dawn, purity, fasting, and ardent devotion must come first. Thus, the learning of the Perfected—who gaze upon clouds and mist to summon descent, or contemplate the formless to evoke resonance—how could it be false or deluded? The Way of Heaven is profoundly silent, its vastness unfathomable. Yet if you possess the heart, where else could it reside but within you? Truly, through sincerity and steadfastness, holding fast to the True, the Dao does not lie far off—it is but a matter of years. When you align with qi, the Dao will descend. This is the Supreme Lord’s wondrous secret; those who attain it become Divine Immortals.

In learning, one must proceed from the lower to the higher, following the proper sequence without omission, lest one violate the celestial statutes. Scriptures are of three ranks, and the Dao has Three Perfected.

The **Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns**, the **Celestial Script of Great Characters**, the **Records of the Nine Heavens**, and the **Way of Yellow and White**—these allow one to rein the reins of the Mysterious Empyrean and wander the Five Peaks, and thus belong to the lowest rank.

The **Numinous Treasure’s Cavern Mystery**, coeval with the Primordial Beginning, profound and abstruse, sharing the same wondrous origin—its pure fasts and fragrant orchids, the Five Invocations illuminating the Mysterious, liberate the seven ancestors and dissolve the roots of transgression. It also summons Perfected Ones to descend and soar into the Grand Clarity, constituting the middle rank’s wondrousness, yielding earthbound immortals of the lower realms.

The **Upper Clarity’s Daoist Scriptures** and the **Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir**—comprising three hundred sacred names and nine thousand jade instructions—are the foremost titles of the Upper Perfected and the inner chapters of the Jade Thearch. Those who attain them are inscribed on the Jade Tablets, their names recorded in the Azure Palace, ascending at dawn to ascend to the Thearch’s Hall. These are the secrets of the highest rank, concealed in the Nine Heavens above, within the Palace of Great Existence.

In learning, one must progress from the lower rank to the Jade Clarity. The Dao possesses Three Marvels:

The **First Marvel**: the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*;
The **Second Marvel**: the *Precious Scripture of the Feminine One*;
The **Third Marvel**: the *Supreme Lord’s Numinous and Primordial Cavern Mystery, Wondrous Scripture of Great Existence*.

These are transmitted only to those who have already become Perfected Ones, not to beginners. If by chance one encounters the opportunity to see their titles, one must not rashly peruse their sacred texts. One should first refine one’s practice through study before advancing toward the True. The Dao is all-encompassing; none who practice it fail to become immortals. Learners should carefully adhere to these words and not neglect them. Those who study the Dao without first mastering the statutes will never succeed. Statutes exist to regulate transgressions; knowing them, one may reform, and naturally align with the Perfected.

The **Statutes of the Supreme Perfected** comprise nine ranks, each with twelve articles.
The **Statutes of the Nine Perfected** comprise three ranks, each with nine articles.
The **Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles** comprise four ranks, each with twenty-four articles.
These prescribe the measures for light and grave transgressions and blessings, and thus learners should first study them. These statutes may also circulate independently, and beginners need not possess all the scriptures.

The *Jade Chapters of the Supreme Lord’s Numinous and Primordial Great Existence* and the *Luminous Statutes of the Nine Perfected* are transmitted only to those whose bone-phase aligns with the True. Following the precedent of the Supreme Thearch’s era, these texts were transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas. The Three Heavens established the norm: within seven thousand years, three transmissions are permitted; within seven hundred years, if a suitable recipient appears, three transmissions are also permitted. According to the statutes, one must present three taels of gold, a hundred feet of purple silk, twenty-seven feet of blue silk, five taels of red thread, a catty of aloeswood, and a tael of cinnabar. One must then visit the master to present the offerings for a hundred days—or thirty days—swearing an oath before the Nine Heavens, the Great Numinous of the Northern Thearch, and the myriad Perfected who govern the Jade Bureau of Immortality, pledging as a covenant. One must vow to keep the sacred texts secret, never to recklessly disclose them or reveal the numinous Perfected, lest one violate the covenant and transgress the statutes. Such offenses will bring calamity upon the nine ancestors, condemning the errant soul to be tortured and bound in hell for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve, the body enslaved and the form maimed, forever barred from immortality.

Those who receive the *Numinous and Primordial Cavern Mystery* must transmit it within the prescribed time limit; beyond that, one may not again reveal its titles to propagate the Three Marvels. The wondrousness of the *Numinous and Primordial Scripture* must be impressed upon later learners, urging those who aspire to diligence to heed the luminous statutes.

The **Nine Mysterious Thearchs of the Latter Saints**, the **Celestial Kings of the Nine Empyreans**, the **Upper Ministers**, the **Azure Lad**, and the **Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate** bow their heads and respectfully inquire of the **Supreme Heavenly Worthy, the Utmost Perfected**: *"The supreme methods are lofty and transcendent, their mystery profound and limpid, interweaving the myriad things. Rooted in quiescence and emptiness, their wondrous arising stirs the Mysterious, transforming through the Three Vehicles, pervading kalpas beyond measure—how could their boundlessness be constrained by luminous statutes?"*

The Supreme Lord says: *"Well said, your words. Those of later generations, unless they are scions of the Jade Clarity born of spontaneity itself, are all conceived in turbid qi and tainted by the clamor of defilement. Their conduct is not purely formed, their nature not single-mindedly good. Though they may yearn for the profound and recondite, their hearts ever turn away from me. Their every action deviates, and none fail to commit transgressions. Transgressions arise externally, diminishing life internally. Those who study under such conditions—how far they stray from the True! If the Three Bureaus record their faults and the Dark Bureau confronts them, extending punishment to the seven ancestors and heaping sins upon the self—those who commit such transgressions, even if they awaken in the Mysterious Capital, will face the system of retribution and the great transformations of the numinous. Yet redemption is permitted: by following the statutes, one may expiate sins, and thus the time of attaining the True will surely draw near."*

Scholars of learning who lack such discipline engage in vain exertions of concentrated thought, gaining nothing from their arduous contemplation. Therefore, the Nine Perfected of the Three Grades and the Radiant Chapters of the Supreme Pole Perfected One were revealed in retreat. The *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Pristine Numinous and Vast Wondrous* was reverently received, its Nine Perfected Regulations and Disciplines concealed within golden treasuries and jade coffers. Guarded by three thousand jade lads and jade maidens, they attend the numinous text, scattering incense in the empty courtyard. Flying dragons and venomous beasts, colossal serpents a thousand fathoms long, brandish their claws along cloud-wreathed ramparts, standing vigil at the Jade Pass.

Thus, every three months, the Ten Heavens’ Great Sages and the Nine Palaces’ Perfected Immortals ascend without fail to the Mysterious Palace, receiving the luminous regulations and paying homage to the numinous text.

The High Minister, Lord Azure Lad, declared: “Those whose bones are of gold and marrow of jade, whose names are enrolled in the Azure Palace, having obtained this scripture and secretly put it into practice, thereby align their rites of reception with the supreme canon. Its application and measures yield merit equal to the Perfected, redeeming sins, dispelling long-standing calamities, and unraveling all knots. The seven ancestral lineages of the Mysterious rejoice, while the practitioner ascends to feast in the Jade Palace.”

**Yang Terrace’s Numinous Life Jade Talisman**
For all who practice the Way to seek transcendence, contemplate the divine and invoke the Perfected, repent sins and dissolve transgressions, and aspire to the grace of the Yang Terrace’s Perfected Ones, immortal officials, and Jade Maidens, inscribe this writ in black ink on the day of Winter’s Advent, face north, and ingest seven talismans. Thereupon, the immortal officials and Jade Maidens shall inscribe one’s name in the immortal register and engrave it upon the golden tablets. After eight years of practice without fail in a single precept, the Perfected Ones shall dispatch eight Jade Lads. Through contemplation of the Perfected and the resonance of feeling, the Perfected Ones will manifest in bodily form, bestowing the sevenfold radiance’s chariot to soar to the Jade Clarity.

**Cavern Perfection’s Nine Vermilion Mottled Talismans**
On the day of the Vernal Equinox, the Lord of Mount Tai in the Eastern Marchmount regularly presents to the Highest Thearch a memorial listing the names of Perfected Immortals who have attained the Way and those newly initiated. To practice the Way of flying transcendence, on that day at sunrise, bathe, fast, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Face east and contemplate the Lord of Mount Tai in the Eastern Marchmount, whose surname is Mysterious Mound and whose given name is Mu Lu. His head bears the Three Treasures’ Ninefold Radiant Night Crown; he wears a skirt of azure feathered regalia and a nine-colored mottled robe, girded with the Highest Sovereign’s Mandate Spirit Talisman. He rides a chariot of azure clouds drawn by nine-colored blue-green dragons, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, bearing the five sacred mushrooms. Turning northeast, he ascends to the boundless heights of the Jade Clarity Heaven, circling within the Azure Clouds of the Mysterious Void. Strike the teeth nine times and intone in the heart: “Today is the supreme seasonal rite; the Eight Vows renew. May the divine canopy of melody turn and descend to my realm, heed my entreaties, and memorialize my supplications. May I ascend to the jade tablets, my name inscribed in the Purple Register. May the Dao Lord turn his radiance upon me, that I attain the rank of Highest Immortal.”

When this is complete, visualize the Lord of Mount Tai descending in his cloud chariot, verdant qi billowing thickly to fill the chamber. The Lord stands amidst the emerald mist, holding a green bamboo slip, inscribing my name upon its pages. Softly intone the incantation:

"Jade Perfected wanders in radiance, illuminating the eastern quarter.
Riding dragons and chariots, soaring through the great void.
Turning the melody of the divine, descending to my chamber.
Green yang announces the beginning; may my highest vows unfold.
Receive my supplications, erase transgressions and record merits.
Engrave my name on the green slip, present it to the August Emperor.
The Western Tortoise binds the register; the Eastern Flower carves the inscription.
Five numina lend their wings; the Eight Emperors shine as one.
Driving *jia* and *yi*, emerging from wood and entering metal.
Six *ding* spirits attend; jade maidens lend their support.
Commanding mountains and summoning seas, restraining dragons and serpents.
Whistling winds and summoning rains—nothing does not instantly obey.
Heavenly demons submit to trial; myriad spirits pay reverence.
Transforming my form and altering my countenance, ascending to the Jade Palace.
May I enjoy the offerings of Mount Tai, preserving eternity without end."

When finished, raise your head and swallow the nine breaths to conclude. Practicing this for nine years, the Lord of Mount Tai will manifest before you, descending in clouds of emerald qi, bestowing nine divine youths and natural spirit mushrooms, granting knowledge of all affairs within ten thousand *li* of the eastern lands. After eighteen years, you will attain dragon chariots, soaring through the void to ascend to the Jade Clarity Heaven.

The Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount, on the summer solstice, presents the register of perfected immortals who have attained the Dao and those newly embarking on the path, reporting to the August Emperor on High, recording and verifying their names, distinguishing merits and transgressions. To cultivate the Way of Flying Immortals, at midday of that day, bathe and purify yourself, enter the chamber, burn incense, and face south to visualize the Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount, whose surname is Yan and personal name Yangguang. He wears the Eight Brilliances Jeweled Radiance Jade Crown, a crimson brocade flying skirt, and a divine-light scarlet-patterned robe, girded with the Seal of Spirit Confinement and Demon Subjugation. He rides a chariot of crimson clouds, accompanied by twelve immortal officials of the Southern Marchmount, all mounted on flying phoenixes, bearing divine mushrooms. Turning southeast, he ascends to the boundless heights of the Jade Clarity Heaven, circling within the crimson clouds of the empty void. Strike the teeth three times and intone in the heart: “Today is the most auspicious of days, a propitious morning answering the perfected. May the universal vows descend; may the Mysterious Heaven renew. I beseech the Dao Lord to dispatch the flying chariot and feathered canopy of the perfected immortals to descend upon me, that my name be spoken in the Upper Clarity and bound in the register of the Eastern Flower.”

When this is complete, visualize the Lord of Mount Heng descending in his crimson cloud chariot to your chamber, vermilion qi swelling to fill the room. The Lord stands amidst the scarlet mist, holding a red bamboo slip, inscribing my name upon its pages. Softly intone the incantation:

"Vermilion yang rides the dawn, wandering the nine heavens.
Crimson chariot and flying canopy, resplendent in the vastness of rosy clouds.
Turning the melody to descend and illuminate, overseeing my earnest heart.
May my highest vows, once uttered, move even the unseen.
Gazing upward to the numinous balance, form and spirit commune.
Inscribe my name on the cinnabar terrace, bind the characters of Southern Jade.
Six *bing* spirits guard the perfected; riding *ding* to enter the whirlwind.
Commanding mountains and sealing seas, restraining the myriad demons.
A thousand spirits submit and flee; all malevolent forces disperse.
As the Southern Marchmount presides, the Three Origins summon.
Descending in crimson chariots, ascending to the imperial court.
Dual luminaries unite in power, transcending the later heavens."

When finished, raise your head and swallow the three breaths to conclude. Practicing this for nine years, the Lord of Mount Heng will bestow upon you sacred scriptures, assign eight immortal officials, and send down divine mushrooms and wondrous substances, granting knowledge of all affairs within ten thousand *li* of the southern lands. After eighteen years, you will attain the chariot of crimson clouds, soaring through the great void to ascend to the Jade Clarity Heaven.

The Lord of Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount, on the autumnal equinox, presents the register of perfected immortals who have attained the Dao and those newly embarking on the path, reporting to the August Emperor on High, recording and verifying their names, distinguishing merits and transgressions. To cultivate the Way of Flying Immortals, at the *bu* hour of that day, bathe and maintain purity, enter the chamber, burn incense, and face west to visualize the Lord of Mount Hua, whose surname is Haoqiu and personal name Yuancang. He wears the Six Origins Divine Flight Crown, a white brocade flying skirt, and a plain silk robe, girded with the Intertwined Numinous White Sash. He rides a chariot of white clouds, accompanied by twelve immortal officials of the Western Marchmount, all mounted on twelve white tigers, bearing seven-colored banners. Turning southwest, he ascends to the boundless heights of the Upper Clarity Heaven, circling within the white clouds of the empty void. Strike the teeth seven times and intone in the heart: “I vow to become a flying immortal, ascending to the Upper Clarity, entering Mount Hua to share the numinous power of the Emperor. I beseech the Dao Lord to descend my true form and bestow immortality upon me, inscribing my mysterious name.”

When this is complete, visualize the Lord of Mount Hua descending in his white cloud chariot to your chamber, white qi shimmering to fill the room. The Lord stands amidst the pale mist, holding a white bamboo slip, inscribing my name upon its pages. Softly intone the incantation:

"Golden gates gleam brightly; white clouds tower majestically.
Four convergences unite the perfected; eight breaths weave the net.
Reporting to the Jade Dawn, the imperial numen ascends in rosy clouds.
Turning the divine to descend, casting its gaze upon my dwelling.
Record me on the white slip, inscribe my name in the Western Flower.
Seven perfected immortals govern; restraining and commanding the hordes of demons.
Upholding the august might, commanding mountains and rivers.
Summoning clouds and descending rains, the dragon chariot swiftly passes.
Conveying me through the flying void, ascending to the numinous peak.
May my wishes be instantly fulfilled; may what I sever be immediately destroyed.
A thousand transformations, myriad changes, penetrating the radiance of the mysterious clouds."

When finished, raise your head and swallow the seven breaths to conclude. Practicing this for nine years, the Lord of Mount Hua will bestow upon you the medicines of the immortals, assigning seven divine youths. After nine years, you will gain knowledge of all affairs, auspicious and ominous, within ten thousand *li* of the western lands. After eighteen years, you will attain the chariot of white clouds, soaring through the great void to ascend to the Jade Clarity Palace.

The Lord of Mount Song of the Central Marchmount, on the days of *wu-chen*, *wu-xu*, *ji-wei*, and *ji-chou* in the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months, presents the register of perfected immortals who have attained the Dao and those newly embarking on the path, reporting to the August Emperor on High, recording and verifying their names, distinguishing merits and transgressions.

To practice the Way of Flying Immortals, on the appointed day, after midday, bathe and purify yourself, enter the chamber, burn incense, and face the four seasons, meditating upon the Lord of the Central Marchmount, whose surname is *Jiao* and whose personal name is *Pusheng*. Don the Jade Crown of the Yellow Dawn of the Middle Prime, wear a yellow brocade flying skirt, drape a black-and-yellow patterned robe, and gird yourself with the Yellow Divine Seal of the Central August. Mount the yellow radiance of the flying chariot, accompanied by twelve immortal officials of the Central Marchmount, all riding flying phosphors, each holding a twelve-jointed black-and-yellow banner. Turn toward the southwest and ascend to the boundless heights of the Jade Clarity Palace, roaming amidst the emptiness within the yellow clouds of the void. Strike the teeth twelve times and recite with focused intent:

*"Heaven hangs its highest vow,
I receive its grace.
Contemplating emptiness, the numinous descends,
Subtle thoughts summon immortality.
Lord of the Central Marchmount,
Bind me to your celestial chariot.
Let me soar and ascend,
Rising to the Golden Gate."*

Conclude, then visualize the Lord of Mount Song descending to your chamber in a flying chariot of yellow radiance, the chamber filled with a surging yellow *qi* that envelops all within. The Lord, within the yellow *qi*, holds a yellow bamboo slip and inscribes your name upon its pages. Softly intone the incantation:

*"August spirit of the Central Mystery,
The Dao veils the purple heavens.
Three unite as one,
Emptiness conjoins to transcendence.
The register of learners safeguards the record,
Securing destiny and extending years.
Inscribe my name in the Eastern Radiance,
Record me among the immortals of the Central Qin.
Five numina shine in repose,
Making my Way resplendent.
Emerging from emptiness, entering subtlety,
Penetrating the Nine Mysteries.
Body born of water and fire,
Transforming into a thousand million luminous forms.
Treading the void, stepping through emptiness,
Soaring without hindrance."*

Conclude, then raise your head and swallow twelve breaths of *qi*.

After nine years of cultivation, you shall converse face-to-face with the Lord of the Central Marchmount, who will descend for you in a flying chariot drawn by yellow dragons, bestow upon you the rank of immortal official, and endow your body with the substances of spontaneity. After eighteen years of practice, the Dao is perfected, and you ascend as a flying immortal to the Jade Purity.

The above is from *The Hidden Scripture of the Eight Daoist Ways and Jade Radiance*.

The **Three Primordials’ Nine Perfected Yang Talismans**, written in gold, bear secret characters:
The **Upper Supervising Celestial Soul Essence Secret Sound Inner Taboo Jade Pendant of Primordial Yang** governs the inner spirits of the lower cinnabar field. Inscribe it in blue on white silk and wear it on the body; also transcribe it on white paper and ingest it on the eight seasonal turning points of your natal destiny. Inwardly contemplate the true essence within the cinnabar field. After three years, you shall behold the true form. The Nine Heavens’ Chancellor records your name in the celestial register, allowing you to meet the Nine Heavens’ Father and Mother. The Thearch descends in form, and the Eight Radiant Ones ascend together with you to the Jade Purity.

The **Dou-Shu Celestial Soul Essence Secret Sound Inner Taboo Jade Pendant of Grand Yang** governs the inner spirits of the Upper True Ones in the Cavern of Yang. Inscribe it in vermilion on white silk and wear it on the body; also transcribe it on white paper and ingest it on the eight seasonal turning points of your natal destiny. Inwardly contemplate the Upper True Ones of the Cavern of Yang. After three years of unbroken practice, you shall behold the true form with five heads and one body. The inner spirits of the Nine Heavens record your name in the Southern Terrace. The Thearch descends to your chamber, refining the hun and restraining the po, transforming the eight spirit-luminants. After eighteen years, your flying form ascends through the Nine Empyreans to the Jade Purity.

The above is from *The Supreme Scripture of the Great Ultimate in Golden Script*.

**Method for Recalling the Spirits, Soaring through the Empyreans, and Ascending to Summon the Five Stars**

The Dao of recalling the spirits and nurturing the elixir, ascending to summon the Five Stars, guards the Seven Mysteries above and dissolves the mortal form below, harmonizing the myriad transformations and establishing the ascent to the Mysterious Principle. Bathe, burn incense, enter the chamber, and purify with a fast. Practice this method, and the Five Viscera shall radiate brightness; the Seven Orifices shall become luminous. The spirits fill the Crimson Palace; the form ascends to the Five Stars. This is the most wondrous method—transmitted only to the true.

It is said that knowing the Dao is easy, but practicing the method is difficult. For this difficult-to-cultivate Dao, how can it not be kept secret?

On the days of *jiazi*, *jiawu*, *yiyou*, *yimao*, *jichou*, *jiwei*, *wuchen*, and *wuxu*, bathe, purify with a fast, enter the chamber, sit facing outward at will, close the eyes, clasp the hands over the heart, and inwardly visualize:

First, the Azure Thearch of the East, whose taboo name is *Tongming* and style *Gaiqing*, wearing a cyan turban, cyan robe, cyan cap, cyan shoes, and bearing the insignia *Tongguang Yangxia*. Enter my body. Then visualize the Four Perfected within the liver, named *Qingming Jun* with the style *Minglun Tongzi*, constantly filling my liver, guarding the gate beneath the membrane of my stomach’s orifice, sealing off the qi of death. For me, they descend the Azure Essence, Azure Water, and Jade Mushroom. Thereupon, visualize the radiant essence of Jupiter, draw it in through the mouth, and swallow ninety times. Let the azure qi fill the liver’s palace to its utmost. Practice this for nine years, and nine Azure Jade Maidens of the Eastern Essentials shall attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Vermilion Thearch of the South, whose taboo name is *Taiyang* and style *Youlin*, wearing a red turban, red robe, red cap, red shoes, and bearing the insignia *Silang Zhubi*. Enter my body. Then visualize the Primordial Cinnabar Thearch within the Crimson Palace, named *Shenyun Zhu* with the style *Zinan*, also called *Shengshang Bo* and *Shiyun Ju*, constantly guarding my Crimson Palace, sealing the gate of my skull to sever the path of dead qi. For me, they descend the Cinnabar Essence, Vermilion Water, and Jade Mushroom. Thereupon, visualize the radiant essence of Mars, draw it in through the mouth, and swallow eighty times. Let the vermilion qi suffuse the Crimson Palace. Practice this for nine years, and eight Vermilion Jade Maidens of the Southern Essentials shall serve at your side.

Next, visualize the White Thearch of the West, whose taboo name is *Tongyin* and style *Yuanqi*, wearing a white turban, white robe, white cap, plain shoes, and bearing the insignia *Haoling Fuxi*. Enter my body. Then visualize the Six Perfected within the lungs, named *Shangyuan Suyu Jun* with the style *Liangnan*, the Central Youth constantly filling my lungs, guarding my Twelve Pass Gates to sever the path of dead qi. For me, they descend the White Mushroom, White Water, and Jade Essence Elixir. Thereupon, visualize the radiant essence of Venus, draw it in through the mouth, and swallow sixty times. Let the stellar qi fill the lung’s palace. Practice this for nine years, and six White Jade Maidens of the Supreme Simplicity shall attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Black Thearch of the North, whose taboo name is *Tongshen* and style *Zigui*, wearing a dark turban, dark robe, dark cap, dark shoes, and bearing the insignia *Yuzhen Xiaofeng*. Enter my body. Then visualize the Seven Perfected within the kidneys, named *Xuanyang Jun* with the style *Mingguang Sheng*, constantly filling my two kidneys, guarding the Earthly Palace of my back and bones to seal the path of dead qi. For me, they descend the Dark Yin Elixir, Nine-Fluid Mushroom, and Mysterious Water. Thereupon, visualize the radiant essence of Mercury, draw it in through the mouth, and swallow fifty times. Let the stellar qi fill the two kidneys. Practice this for nine years, and five Dark Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery shall attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Yellow Thearch of the Center, whose taboo name is *Wanfu* and style *Dacang*, wearing a yellow turban, yellow robe, yellow cap, yellow shoes, and bearing the insignia *Zhongyuan Bawen Yumen*. Enter my body. Then visualize the Five Perfected within the spleen, named *Yangguang Jun* with the style *Taichang Zi*, constantly filling my spleen, guarding the gate of my root’s extremity to sever the path of dead qi. For me, they bring the Yellow Water, Moonflower, Jade Embryo, and Elixir Mushroom. Thereupon, visualize the radiant essence of Saturn, draw it in through the mouth, and swallow twelve times. Let the qi fill the spleen’s palace. Practice this for nine years, and twelve Yellow Jade Maidens of the Supreme Simplicity shall attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Primordial Father of the Upper Mystery, named *Gaotong Sheng* with the style *Zuohui Ming*, and the Primordial Mother of the Lower Mystery, named *Shuhuo Wang* with the style *Youhui Guang*. These two spirits guard the root of my natal destiny, sealing the source of my dead qi. For me, they bring the Yang Mushroom and Yin Essence, nourishing my body. Visualize the radiance of the Two Luminants of the Sun and Moon, illuminating my singular form. Draw in the light and color through the mouth, swallowing thirty-six times. Let the luminous qi fill the Cinnabar Field Palace below the navel. Practice this for nine years, and your face shall bear a golden countenance; your eyes shall emit flowing light. You shall command the Six *Jia* and summon the Six *Ding*, fulfilling every desire, and the Perfected shall visit your chamber.

Upon completing the visualization of the Five Thearchs and the Two Luminants’ true spirits, recite the incantation:

The Five Stars entwine and bind,
their light flowing with inner brightness.
The Two Luminants soar with radiant clouds,
irrigating the Five Essences.
The true spirits fill and store,
long preserving the Yellow Peace.
The Great One’s mighty plan
transforms the embryo and recalls infancy.
The liver and lungs knit their blossoms;
the heart and kidneys fill to abundance.
The spleen guards the Central Mystery,
and the Five Mushrooms receive life.
The precious light of the Sun and Moon
merges with the Thearch.
Soaring through the void,
ascend to pay homage in the Jade Purity.

Next, visualize the Three Perfected of Essence and Blood, named *Yuansheng Jun* with the style *Huangning Zi*, constantly filling the source beneath my two orifices and bone joints. The Two Perfected, named *Jianyu Jun* with the style *Ningyu Zhu*, fill my Great Granary Palace and the mouths of the Five Intestines. The One Perfected within the heart, named *Tianjing Ye Jun* with the style *Feisheng Shangying*, fills the mouths of the Four Extremities within my chest. The Nine Primordial Perfected: the male, named *Juzhi* with the style *Sanyang*, guards the gate of *Fuchen* in my left ear and the soul of the August One; the female, named *Shanggui* with the style *Dizi*, fills the gate of *Fuchen* in my right ear. The Purple Simplicity Left Primordial Lord, named *Yiyu Wuren* with the style *Anlai Shang*, fills the realm of my head and face.

The Yellow Simplicity Central Primordial Lord, named *Yuanhua Huangren* with the style *Taizhang Shang*, fills the realm of my chest and abdomen. The White Simplicity Right Primordial Lord, named *Qiming Xiaoren* with the style *Jinmen Shang*, fills the realm of my lower gates.

The Director of Destinies within the Sun, named *Jiesheng*, fills my left hand. The Peach Lord within the Moon, named *Fangying*, fills my right hand.

The Primordial White Qi Lord of the Womb, named *Wuxuan Zi* with the style *Yushang Sheng*, and the Supreme One’s Essence-Soul, named *Xuangui Zi* with the style *Shengchang*, these two spirits fill the root of my throat above the Five Viscera.

The Azure Qi Lord of the Throat’s Core, named *Anyan Chang* with the style *Hehe Ying*, and the Primordial Lord’s Essence-Soul, named *Baogutong* with the style *Mingfu*, these two spirits fill the region above the Great Stomach below the Five Viscera.

The Black Qi Lord of the Joints, named *Fulaisheng* with the style *Jingshang Men*, and the Imperial Perfected Essence-Soul, named *Youtai Yu* with the style *Guanshang Sheng*, these two spirits fill the mouths of my Nine Intestines and below the Hidden Source.

The Yellow Qi Lord of the Womb, named *Zuming Che* with the style *Shenwuji*, and the Heavenly Emperor’s Essence-Soul, named *Liweizang* with the style *Fazhu*, these two spirits fill the root of my two orifices within the lesser abdomen.

The Red Qi Lord of the Blood, named *Hunli Zi* with the style *Shubaojian*, and the Director of Destinies’ Essence-Soul, named *Faniu Zi* with the style *Qingxuan*, these two spirits fill the blood of my hundred joints and below the severed nodes.

The Supreme Primordial Father Lord, named *Gaotong Sheng* with the style *Zuohui Ming*, and the Lower Primordial Mysterious Mother, named *Shuhuo Wang* with the style *Youhui Guang*, the August Supreme One, named *Chongming Kong* with the style *Youliao Wu*, the Nine August Honored Ones, named *Mingzhen* with the style *Zhongdi Sheng*, the Supreme Emperor’s Essence-Soul, named *Yangtang Yu* with the style *Baling*, the Nine Gates’ Soul, named *Lühui Dao* with the style *Xueming*, and the Heavenly Register’s Imperial Soul, named *Zhaowu A* with the style *Guangshen*—these seven spirits fill the root of my original destiny, seal the gates of my death’s path, and through visualization and invocation, all the Perfected from head to navel shine clearly. Thus, the Golden Liquid flows in circuits, the Jade Florescence illumines the soul, the divine nectar overflows within the hidden intestines, and the Imperial Qi suffuses the Nine Gates. The seven ancestors are released from the Three Wretched Realms, reborn in the Southern Palace, the Spirit of Life is established within this body, and the true qi is spread to secure the years.

When finished, knock the teeth thirty-nine times and invoke:
*“Qi arises from the formless; congealed qi gives birth to spirit.”*

The yang qi offers itself outward, the yin qi ascends within. The two symbols invert and intertwine, conjoining the primordial spirit. The inner Perfected fill and guard, the nine apertures receive life. Preserve the hun-soul, secure the po-soul, and the ten thousand spirits settle in peace. Safeguard my Three Passes, let the radiant mushrooms fill them to abundance. Ascend with me, together we ascend to Jade Purity.

When finished, swallow qi thirty-nine times to fill the thirty-nine portals. The qi moistens and permeates, flowing throughout the body. If one can cast off burdens, untether from worldly dust, calm the heart and level the intent, clearly behold the empty chamber, gaze inward in visualization, fill the spirit and secure the soul, cut off the death-qi at the nine portals, and fill the life-palace at the Passes—revolving in visualization and invocation, as if speaking face to face—then after three years of day and night, the true spirit will manifest in form. Radiant splendor returns to the root, decayed teeth regrow, the five viscera bind their networks, and the inner self is replenished to fullness. One may command the Six Jia spirits, dispatch the Six Ding, summon guests from the Nine Empyreans, and invite the divine chariot of the Three Primes. Spirit soars and form ascends, rising in broad daylight to the morning court.

This is the divine treasure of the Highest Perfected, named *Inner Character*, filling the human body within, circulating the qi of the Nine Heavens to secure the six viscera’s mechanisms. The myriad essences transform and arise, all depending on the spirit. When the spirit is full, life flourishes; when the spirit departs, death follows. With diligent heart and accumulated resonance, one may uplift the body’s form to ascend to the Mysterious Palace. In the pursuit of immortality, if one does not know the inner names of form and spirit, nor how to fill and seal the portals of death, how can one hope for life? Those who cultivate this Way must not tread upon defilement, consume the five pungent foods, or offend the upright qi of their nature—else the spirit will depart. They know the allure of rich delicacies for the palate and the glory of rank and emolument for the body, yet do not perceive that such delicacies are axes that wound life, and that extravagant rank and splendor are the sources that drain the true. Thus, the divine beings love seclusion and dwell in stillness, never revealing their forms amid the winds of the world. Can those who cultivate life afford not to be cautious?

The Highest Sage and Imperial Lord says: To inscribe your name in the Upper Clarity, on the golden script and jade registers of the flying ascent to the Upper Clarity Palace, you must on the second day of the second month write in green ink the ten sounds of the jade register on white paper, face due east, and ingest it. Knock the teeth nine times and softly intone:

*"Yinyuan, Mysterious Numen, inheritor of the ancient void’s law.
Bone and form align with the chart, jade register and golden script.
The River’s Chariot binds the self, the five spirits shine forth.
Next, celebrate the Two Primes, the Mysterious Perfected descend to the abode.
Name inscribed in Upper Clarity, granted the flying chariot.
Endless enjoyment, blessings and love in surplus."*

When finished, swallow qi eight times and bow eight times toward the Upper Clarity Palace of the Eight August Divine Lords.

Practice this for nine years, and you will receive the jade register of Upper Clarity, inscribed and carved, ascending in the cinnabar cloud-chariot to the Jade Purity Palace.

The Highest Sage and Imperial Lord says: Those with jade bones and cinnabar script, whose names are listed in the Imperial Chart, may behold the Mysterious Records of the Seven Sages. Those with golden marrow and purple treasuries, whose names are inscribed on golden tablets, may behold the hidden texts within. Those with divine marvels and rare hairs, purple wombs and jade networks, whose names are marked in Upper Clarity, may behold the upper chapters of the white slips. Those with flowing essence and purple radiance, inner illumination and outer entwinement, golden treasuries and jade countenances, whose names are written in Jade Emptiness, may behold the green register’s texts. Those with divine stalwarts aligned with the chart, jade embryos and purple voids, whose names are inscribed in Eastern Florescence, may behold the texts of the Seven Injuries.

Without such stalwarts, the sacred scrolls cannot be rashly unfurled, nor the treasure texts casually viewed. Those who behold these texts are of a mysterious essence aligned with immortality. After nine years of cultivation, they may attain flight through the Mysterious Void and ascend to Jade Purity.

**Five Bells Ascending the Void, Guarding the Immortal’s Upper Talisman, named Fire Bell**

At the inception of the Great Tenuity Heavenly Lord’s reception of qi, when the mysterious symbols first divided, he ascended the Terrace of Ninefold Mysterious Void-Birth. The divine officials of the Five Emperors guarded the eight directions, the five talismans shimmered in empty radiance, now present, now absent, amid the misty Phoenix Terrace and the winding chambers of the jade halls. After seven thousand years, their script appeared. Its flowing light illumined the Nine Empyreans, its text blazed resplendent in Jade Purity.

Cast to the left, it becomes the Flowing Gold Fire Bell; shaken to the right, it becomes the Vast and Lofty Seven Primes. It subjugates the demons of the utmost heavens, its might spreads through the distant courts of the Nine Expanses. The ultimate and wondrous Way is subtle and profound, difficult to attain.

The Heavenly Lord purified himself in the Jade Chamber of the Great Void’s Mysterious Terrace, within the Golden Flower Room of the Jade Hall. Attended by maidens and Perfected, the five-colored divine officials, ten billion myriad beings, flying beasts and poisonous dragons flanked the gates, while giant serpents a thousand fathoms long guarded the walls. Phoenixes sang and dragons roared, a hundred sounds echoed through the halls, their majesty resounding in the vast court. Lions roared, divine songs were blown, jade tones flowed in brilliance. Divine consorts harmonized in song, jade maidens plucked and strummed the strings. Then the Central Yellow Elder Lord and the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate were invited. They set out the nectar of flowing radiance, the fruits of hard jade, red trees with white seeds, hidden mushrooms and parted knots, and a profusion of fragrant blossoms.

After ninety days, the Tortoise Mother held the brush, the Great One dusted the mat, the Heavenly Consort attended with incense, and Jade Splendor composed the text. They inscribed it on white jade slips in golden script and entrusted it to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, sealing it in a cloud-brocade pouch with a jade clasp. It was then transmitted to the Central Yellow Elder Lord. The Lord, adhering to the covenant, received the five talismans, bowed his head, and withdrew. Immediately, he summoned the Nine Numinous Flowing Radiance Cloud-Chariot, fifty thousand five-colored divine officials, and flying azure-feathered dragon-cloaks, ascending to the Golden Gate and Jade Purity Palace.

**Inner Visualization to Shake Might: The Great Spell of Divine Wisdom for the Flowing Gold Fire Bell**

Wear the Flowing Gold Fire Bell. When traveling far or near, passing through perilous passes, bandits, illnesses, calamities, or harm, visualize the true light to guard yourself and open a path of ten thousand leagues. At the start of your journey, face the direction and knock the teeth fourteen times. Swallow qi thirty-six times, then visualize the destination’s forms—mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, birds, beasts, and spirits—all clearly and distinctly, coming to pay homage to your body. Envision the Northern Dipper’s seven stars covering your head. Then visualize your left eye as a shooting star, your right eye as swift lightning, their radiance blazing and surging ninety thousand leagues away. See the path to your destination open along the light, mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people’s dwellings, soldiers, bandits, and ghostly qi all dissolved without a trace, the four roads suddenly clear.

Then recite the incantation:

"Front opens, rear closes,
Heaven levels, earth rises.
Divine lords set forth,
Four roads stretch wide.
Let heaven and earth
Become my bridge.
Before and behind, left and right,
All eight directions penetrate through.

My left casts a shooting star,
My right flashes swift lightning.
Fire flows ten thousand leagues—
What demon dares stand before me!
The Great One escorts me,
Ten thousand spirits come to greet.
Wherever I go, wherever I face,
All is auspicious and good.

Riding clouds, driving emptiness,
I ascend to the great void."

When finished, draw back the essence of both eyes, each returning to its palace. Inhale seven breaths of qi from the left, then seven from the right and swallow them. Thus, you may brave peril and traverse danger, subdue ghosts and strike down soldiers—none will fail to respond, all will scatter like echoes.

This method is most wondrous; do not transmit it carelessly. Pass it only by word of mouth, and guard it with utmost clarity!

The Five Emperors’ Flowing Bells and Five Talismans command the demons of the highest heavens, summon and bind the spirits of the five directions. Above, they correspond to the five stars and the descent of the Seven Origins; below, they align with the nine orifices and seven luminances of the human body. They pervade heaven and earth, leaving nothing unconnected, no darkness unprobed, no detail unseen. When the talisman is visualized, its light appears; when cast, its might shakes the world.

If you wear them and receive the master’s words, when in the human realm you encounter a place of evil ghosts, perform the Great Invocation of Shaking Might. Face north, hold your breath for twelve cycles, and envision the qi of the five directions covering your body inside and out, so that all becomes dark and nothing is seen. Then knock your left teeth thirty-six times, swallow the qi of the five directions—three breaths for each—and let the qi fully enter your body. Visualize the light of your two eyes’ youths like shooting stars, blazing and falling across the five directions.

Recite the incantation:

"Heavenly Origin’s Seven Essences,
Five Emperors’ Flowing Bells.
Radiant lightning flashes,
Like stars rushing through the sky.
Illuminating the ten directions,
Revealing ghosts’ true forms.
What petty demon
Dares face my gate of life!
The Supreme has decreed:
Slay without mercy.
Sever livers, split bellies,
Exterminate ghostly essence.
Thousands upon thousands crushed,
Myriads upon myriads toppled.
Divine might utters the spell,
Binding without cease."

Then swallow qi thirty-six times to conclude. With this single incantation, the divine officials of the five directions will protect your life and gather the vital qi of all spirits in the vicinity, binding them to appear before you. Three recitations will extinguish the lineage of ghostly qi.

When entering the Five Peaks or traversing mountains and rivers, braving perilous heights, knock your left teeth thirty-six times a hundred paces before reaching the place. If going to the Eastern Peak, visualize the Azure Emperor, Lord Xilin Zhu, with his retinue of nine thousand dead guarding your front and rear, and azure mist covering your body. If going to the Southern Peak, visualize the Vermilion Emperor, Lord Danxuan Zi, with his retinue of eight thousand guarding your front and rear, and crimson clouds covering your body. If going to the Western Peak, visualize the White Emperor, Lord Shaohao Ling, with his retinue of six thousand guarding your front and rear, and white clouds covering your body. If going to the Northern Peak, visualize the Black Emperor, Lord Xuanming Hao, with his retinue of five thousand guarding your front and rear, and black clouds covering your body. If going to the Central Peak, visualize the Yellow Emperor, Lord Zhizhong Yuan, with his retinue of twelve thousand guarding your front and rear, and yellow qi covering your body.

Recite the incantation:

"Radiant spirit of Qian Heaven,
Seven dawns’ mysterious essence.
Five Dipper’s flowering canopy
Enwraps my form.
Five-colored flying coverings
Merge and intertwine.
My body bears the Seven Origins,
Flowing golden fire bells.
Radiance flashes boundlessly,
Reaching the darkest heavens.
Divine officials of the Five Emperors,
Drive and command the heavenly soldiers.
For me, subdue and restrain
The mountain and river spirits, the thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits.
All bind their heads,
Presenting their true forms,
Slain before, executed behind—
No capture ceases."

With this single incantation, heavenly demons vanish without trace, and ten thousand spirits come to pay homage. When traveling the Five Peaks and traversing mountains and rivers, you will suffer no trials or perils. The immortals of the Five Peaks will personally present the Five Mushrooms and Five Flowers to nourish your body.

If amidst soldiers and bandits, beneath hanging blades, or in dire straits, knock your right teeth twelve times, visualize the Northern Dipper covering your body, its dark light shining through and enveloping you entirely. Knock your left teeth twelve times, envision your liver as Jupiter, emerging from your left lung as Venus, from your right heart as Mars, from your front as Mercury, from your rear spleen as Saturn, and from your chest, so the five stars’ essence coils around your front and rear. Your body resides within the Dipper’s bowl, beneath the five stars. Next, visualize the divine officials of the Five Emperors guarding your left and right.

Recite the incantation:

"Heaven is my roof,
Earth is my bed.
The Five Peaks and rivers
Are my bridges.
Mysterious Dipper’s primordial essence
Tailors my robes.
I hide within the Seven Origins,
In the land of flowing fire.
Those who ferry me: Taiyi Wuyou,
Those who pass me: Baiyuan Wuying.
Disaster cannot touch me,
Weapons cannot harm me.
Let my body ascend
To the Golden Gate, the capital of the Nine Elders."

Thus, in moments of distress, you will attain liberation.

Prepare fifty feet of five-colored brocade to petition the immortal officials of the Five Emperors. Five taels of purple gold as a pledge to the five directions. Five catties of agarwood to ascend to the Three Origins Palace. One catty of true pearls as a covenant of cinnabar. One inscribed knife to sever the path of deathly qi. Seven gold pearls to offer and invite the essence of the Seven Origins. Seventy feet of crimson silk as a token of blazing light.

For those who receive the talismanic scriptures, present precious pledges to the master, purify yourself for three days, bathe, burn incense, and expose the talismans and scriptures on a high altar overnight. The next morning, ascend the altar together to report to the Northern Emperor, initiate the covenant of the talismanic scriptures, and transmit them to the disciple. After ascending the altar to make the vow, do not recklessly reveal the text or lightly disclose the scriptures. Your body will bear the punishment of the wind blade.

Should a disciple uninitiated yet unfurl the scroll, calamity shall strike the Seven Mysteries, and the body shall be maimed, the eyes blinded. The statutes of the Four Poles forbid the reckless disclosure of scriptures; the laws of the Supreme Perfection bar those without covenant or pledge. Unless one’s name is inscribed in gold and jade, none may behold or witness these texts. Seekers of immortality who bear not the Five Talismans upon their person shall find no protection from the immortal officials of the Five Peaks; the registers of the Three Bureaus shall not erase their names from the ledgers of death. Dwelling in mountain caves, they shall be undone by the demonic workers of the Nine Heavens; venturing among men, they shall not escape the blades of magistrates and soldiers. Yet those who bear the talismans may tread the heavens and traverse the abyss, roaming boundlessly in all directions, moving as they will. By meditating upon the true spirits, they return to their original palace, where the Five Mushrooms sprout of themselves, and their bodies radiate jade-like light. Immortal officials stand guard, the Three Origins attend their chamber, and they ride the clouds, steering the void to ascend to the Jade Purity of the Highest Heaven.

—From the *Scripture of the Cavern Perfection: The Purple Ascension of the Radiant Divine Primordial Transformation*

Should one encounter a person with the head of a dragon and the body of a phoenix, or one with the body of a phoenix and nine heads like crows, know that this is the descent of the palace of the Left Governance of the Primordial Heavenly King of the Origin, the True One of the Luminous Void, upon the disciple’s form—a sign that the Dao is nearing fulfillment. Speak not of this. Strike the teeth nine times, swallow the qi thirty-two times, and secretly recite the incantation:

The Two Ways flow in order,
The Origin lingers in cycles.
The Mysterious True shines bright,
The Nine Numinous scatter wide.
Gaze unceasing, boundless,
Descend upon me with radiance.
Above, part the crimson light,
Dissolve stagnation, open the heart,
To ride the flying clouds,
And soar into the Purple Tenuity.

When finished, bow thrice in the heart and cease. Practicing this for three hundred days, one shall behold the true form of the Origin, receive the celestial writings of the Nine Heavens, and fly to the Jade Purity.

—From the *Scripture of the Cavern Perfection: The Jade Tallies of the Three Origins*

The Central Great Yellow Jade Talisman of the Myriad Origins: Should a disciple seek the presence of the Jade Controller of the Yellow Emperor, on the day of the Grand Year corresponding to one’s birth, face the year-star and write in red upon yellow paper to ingest it, or write in red upon yellow silk to wear it. After nine years, the Jade Controller shall erase the disciple’s record of death, transfer their name to the palace of life, and dispatch a chariot of yellow mist to welcome the disciple’s body, ascending to the Jade Purity Palace.

The *Fourfold Luminous Statutes of the Great Mystery Capital* state: The *Azure Essentials* in purple script and the *Golden Root* among the multitude of scriptures are the self-generated chapters of the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, received by the Jade Emperor of the Nine Yang Primordial Sovereign. Sealed in the Seven Treasures Jade Terrace of the Mysterious Numinous Nine Heavens, they are guarded by thirty hundred jade maidens, transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. The Azure Essentials Emperor Lord, the Supreme Void Sovereign of the Primordial Numinous Dao, the Grand Simplicity High Numinous Cavern Radiance Lord, and the Southern Culmen Supreme Origin Lord—these myriad emperors commanded that one scripture be sealed upon Mount Wangwu. Should one possess a body of gold and bones of jade, their name inscribed in the imperial registers, and within seven hundred years encounter such a person, they may, upon assessing their virtue, transmit it thrice. The transmitter and receiver shall each offer one gold fish and one jade dragon, one hundred feet of purple silk, and forty feet of azure silk. Master and disciple shall fast together for one hundred days, then transmit the scripture after making a covenant. Twenty-four jade maidens and twenty-four jade lads shall be assigned to protect the disciple’s body. After one hundred days of cultivation, they shall attain communion with the numinous and summon the true. After nine years, they shall ride the clouds to fly to the Jade Purity.

Should one violate the precepts and prohibitions thrice, they shall be barred from attaining immortality; should they violate them five times, their seven generations of ancestors and their own person shall be subjected to trial, while the Three Officials of the Left and Right shall condemn them to the knife mountains and fire realms, the Twenty-Four Peaks, and after ten thousand kalpas, they may only return to serve as lesser ghosts bearing stones. The *Lüwen* of the Left Palace of Xuandu must be received with clarity and reverence.

The Nine Heavens’ Venerable and the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads, in the first year of the celestial cycle, at the hour of *chen* when the Northern Dipper shifts its pivot, the Three Origins align in radiance, the Nine Emperors return to truth, and ascend to the Jade Mansion of the Supreme Void in the Purple Emptiness Heaven. The *Three-Nine Plain Speech* unlocks the numinous pass; the Jade Essence True Formula governs life’s enduring principle. Tranquil and vast, pure and unbounded, the Jade Decree illumines the void, the jade tones soar beyond the clouds. Fragrant winds stir without cease, wisdom’s chant resounds afar. Its fragrance flows into profound mysteries, its qi crowns the divine whirlwind. The Jade Seal commands all, and the ten thousand immortals come to court. This is the wondrous transformation of primordial antiquity, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without decay. Compose the true formula to guide contemplation, test the seeker’s heart with diligence. Should one’s golden name be inscribed in the Eastern Florescence and their verdant sobriquet in the Purple Court, receiving this wondrous scripture, they shall ascend to the Jade Purity.
*Excerpted from the* Three-Nine Plain Speech Jade Essence True Formula.

The Scripture of the Supreme Master of the Purple Dawn
The Divine Continent lies north of the Celestial Pass, with the sun and moon revolving to its south, the Seven Stars turning at its center. By day, the Eight Wefts revolve leftward; by night, the Seven Warps turn rightward. As the Seven Stars complete their circuit, the celestial radiance returns to the numinous. This is the court where the Supreme Purple Dawn receives transformation. By cultivating the Seven Revolutions, one ascends to the Jade Purity. For the Way of the Seven Revolutions, on the first and fifteenth days of each month and the eight solar terms, one must fast, enter the chamber at noon, face east, and recite the Seven Revolutions’ chapter eight times. At midnight, face north and recite it seven more times, totaling fifteen revolutions in a day and night. This aligns above with the Celestial Pass, revolving the Three Luminaries; within, it orders the body, unblocks the passages, and secures the spirit; below, it subdues the myriad demons, swiftly extinguishes the thousand spirits, harmonizing the revolutions and aligning the Three and Five. Those who fail in this Way shall die and enter the dark underworld. Through earnest cultivation and arduous devotion, one may ride the flying wheel, ascend to the Purple Dawn, and wander in the Jade Purity.

The Fifth Chapter of the Supreme Great Dao Lord’s Scripture
The *Jade Chapter of the Divine Continent* states:
The radiance transforms the Nine Dark Gates,
The Jade Dawn circles the Purple Essence.
Within, it illumines the abyssal palaces,
Riding the void to the Fourfold Luminosity.
The Dharma Wheel completes three cycles,
Seven transformations return to the formless.
The Great One inspects the celestial demons,
The revolving chapter examines the thousand spirits.
Left, the whistling penetrates the subtle mystery;
Right, the chant overturns the Nine Heavens.
Order descends upon the Eight Wastes,
The sweeping gaze commands the divine soldiers.
It rescues from the seven ancestors’ tribulations,
Transcends to the Immortal Emperor’s court.
The Controller of Destiny safeguards the original register,
The Eastern Palace inscribes the jade name.
The returning light enters the Mud-Pill Palace,
The five viscera flourish with splendor.
The radiant scene bears the round pearl,
Securing the soul to preserve kalpic years.
Above, one feasts in the Nine Empyrean’s halls,
Serene and ascending to the Jade Purity.
*Excerpted from the* Divine Continent’s Seven Revolutions and Seven Transformations Dance of Heaven Scripture.

In the autumnal months, practice the Way while contemplating the spirits to summon the numinous. Inscribe in yellow on white paper, face west, and ingest it. After a hundred days, one attains communion with the numinous; after a thousand days, one beholds the spirits. The Supreme Perfected descend, and one meets the immortal countenance. Six Jade Maidens of the Primordial Void are dispatched to refine the golden essence of the solar radiance and forge the mushroom luster. Also, inscribe in white on azure silk and place it to the west of one’s seat or sleeping mat, wrapping it in white silk. After a hundred days, the White Elder descends to the chamber, and the White Emperor’s officials and guardian spirits of the divine script protect the practitioner’s body. After six years, the Three Primordial Cloud Chariots descend to cover one’s person, who then ascends in form to the Great Void, flying to the Jade Purity.

The Western Florescence Supreme Void Sovereign Lord’s Primordial Qi of the Supreme August One has a personal name and style, with a form sixty million *zhang* in height. In the autumnal months, he wears a crown adorned with the Three Luminaries’ Jade Flower Pearl, robes of the natural numinous script, a sash bearing the Nine Heavens’ Demon-Restraining Banner, and a belt with the Interlocking Gold Solar Essence Sword. Seated upon a plain cloud, he holds a golden talisman, its brilliance resplendent, illuminating the Supreme Purity. Amidst the plain clouds and the depths of the Eight Darknesses, he contemplates returning to a length of six *cun* and six *fen*.

In the winter months, the Western Florescence Supreme Void Sovereign Lord transforms into a form with the head of a tiger and the body of a man, clad in a seven-colored tiger robe, its patterns resplendent and variegated. Amidst the white clouds above the Supreme Purity, he contemplates returning to his true form.

In the spring months, the Western Florescence Supreme Void Sovereign Lord transforms into a straight-standing figure, his color like yellow gold, his neck bearing a circular radiance. He wears a robe of thirty-two strips in nine colors, its brilliance penetrating and illuminating the ten directions. Amidst the purple clouds above the Jade Purity, he contemplates returning to his true form.

In the summer months, the Western Florescence Supreme Void Sovereign Lord transforms into a dual radiance of red and white, its hue turbid and lustrous like jade essence, illuminating the Supreme Purity. This is the reflux of the Western Florescence’s *qi*, whereupon he receives the refined essence of the Supreme August One, contemplating his return to the true form.

To practice the Way of the Western Florescence, one should enter the chamber on the day of the autumnal equinox, face west, and bow six times in homage to the Supreme Void Sovereign Lord. Then turn north, click the teeth nine times, and contemplate the Supreme Void Sovereign Lord following the four seasons, his form and luminous presence residing in the Jade Purity’s Sound-and-Light Palace, within the Eightfold Enclosure Prefecture’s Fourfold Radiance Village of the Utmost Subtlety. As the true form revolves downward to reflect, it enters the rear gate of the adept’s chest. Then recite the incantation:

*"Western Florescence unfurls its numen,
Golden Gate gleams with essence.
Refined through four transformations,
This is called the Jade Purity.
Divine and true conjoin in harmony,
Joy flows and fortune arises.
Qi spreads and the hun-soul rests,
Spirit guards and the po-soul is serene.
The Great One safeguards the record,
The Controller of Destiny inscribes the name.
The root of the womb is extinguished,
The stomach’s tubes flourish in splendor.
Ever to enjoy primordial auspiciousness,
The Three Luminaries share one’s lifespan."*

When finished, inhale six breaths of *qi* and cease.

Practicing this Way for nine years, the Western Florescence’s curved radiance descends, divine and true forms alight, penetrating the void and attaining the subtle. Transformations are instantaneously accomplished; one may sit in death or stand in life, flying to the Jade Purity.

For those seeking the Way of Immortality, on the winter solstice at noon, enter the chamber, face north, and recline or sit as one wishes. Close the eyes and inwardly contemplate the Mystic Radiance Lady of the Moon, recalling her surname and personal name. Her form is five *cun* and five *fen* in length, her hair bound in a cloud-like topknot, clad in a dark brocade flying skirt. She holds moonlight in her mouth, which descends into the adept’s heart. In an instant, the moonlight scatters into yellow *qi*, enveloping the adept’s body. The Lady, within the moon, gathers from the Azure Florescence Grove and scatters it amidst the yellow *qi*. She exhales the red *qi* of yang essence to bathe the adept’s form, from within to without. The yellow and red *qi* intertwine, illuminating the entire body. The Lady bestows upon the adept six vermilion characters in purple script. Then draw in the yellow *qi* thirty-two times, the yang essence twenty-four times, and cease. Click the teeth twenty-four times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Mystic Yin’s frigid pool,
Flowing springs in vast courtyards.
Flying blossoms scatter their radiance,
Exhaling yellow and inhaling essence.
One qi entwines and coils,
Jade mushrooms sprout in the void.
Jade maidens sip fragrance,
The Lady wings her numen.
Orchid pools surge in torrents,
Flowing yellow in boundless depths.
The heavens universally receive their glow,
Descending to bathe my form.
Restore youth and refine the countenance,
To white hair knotting into black.
Purple characters in the Eastern Palace,
Vermilion script on green tablets.
Winged steeds and feathered canopies,
Four Perfected Ones guide the chariot.
Bearing me to ascend together,
All arrive at the Jade Purity."*

Cease, then inhale *qi* thirty-two times and swallow saliva twenty-four times. Ingest the purple-script vermilion characters.

Practicing this Way for eight years, the Lady bestows upon the adept the Bright Moon’s Pendants and the Way of the Vermilion Characters, enabling flight through the Mystic Void and ascent to the Jade Purity.

The above purple-script vermilion characters and the Moon’s Hidden Sounds are all inscribed in the Azure Void Grove of the moon’s southern realm, forming natural script. The Eightfold Simplicity Perfected Ones and the various celestial beings all gather and ingest these purple-script vermilion characters on the summer solstice. Those who ingest these six characters will share the same lifespan as the Eightfold Simplicity, their necks bearing circular radiance to illuminate the ten directions. These sounds are most secret. The August Eightfold Simplicity Perfected Ones inscribed these sounds in the *Eightfold Simplicity Jade Chapters*, thus making this a sublime and wondrous scripture. To lightly divulge these numinous sounds is to condemn one’s seven ancestors to servitude, bound to the Knife Mountain, their bodies scourged by the wind’s blades, never again to attain immortality.

One should inscribe these characters in vermilion on white paper on the summer solstice at midnight and ingest them. Click the teeth twelve times and softly recite the incantation:

*"Yang essence’s cinnabar pool,
Flowing fire and surging winds.
Golden chariots wing the void,
Mystic radiance brushes the heavens.
Eight azure ones gather orchids,
Scattering fragrance in the Jade Court.
Azure groves droop willows,
Wind stirs the jade branches.
Vermilion script and purple writings,
Containing blossoming splendor.
Flowing fragrance bathes the ford,
Universally moistening without bound.
Attaining the Mystic Radiance,
Sharing the light of the Purple Empyrean."*

When finished, inhale *qi* twenty-four times and cease. Also, wear the vermilion-script purple writings upon the head. After three years, the sun and moon’s mystic radiance will illuminate the adept’s form, and the Moon Radiance Lady will bestow true scriptures, granting six jade maidens. To lightly transmit these to the unworthy is to condemn one’s seven ancestors to servitude, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas.

Secretly cultivating for eight years, the cloud chariots will descend, and one will ascend to heaven in broad daylight, flying to the Jade Purity.

For all scholars who study and ingest the Way of the Sun and Moon, on the autumnal equinox at the *bu* hour, take three *ge* of dragon fat (dragon bone is also excellent), and inscribe in azure the Ninefold Refined Dragon Radiance Talisman on white paper. Combine and cast them into clear water, face east, and bathe. Before the basin, click the teeth twenty-four times and softly recite the incantation as on the vernal equinox. When finished, inhale *qi* nine times and cease. Return to the chamber, burn incense, grind the dragon bone into powder, and dust the body. Rub the hands together to anoint the face and entire body. Lie with the head to the east, click the teeth nine times, close the eyes, clench the fists, and contemplate the sun’s purple *qi* descending in layers to envelop the body. Envision oneself within the sun’s radiance, the sun’s radiance revolving the body upward to the Hall of Vast Cold, within the Well of the East, beneath the High Ringing Tree. Contemplate the Vermilion Numen Lesser Yang Perfected One, recalling his surname and given name. His form is nine *cun* in length, clad in a flying robe of azure feathers, his head crowned with a diadem of penetrating essence and luminous radiance. He exhales green *qi* to bathe the adept’s body. From a vessel of lapis lazuli, he offers the jade sap of the Azure Mushroom to anoint the adept’s form, feeding him the blossoms of the three *qi*. Perceiving their sweet fragrance, the body feels as though bathed in warm rain. Then inhale *qi* ninety times and softly recite the incantation.

Within the Jade Gate and Orchid Chamber, the sun’s radiance soars on high. The Three Flowers knit their splendor, wondrous light brushing the dawn. Primal Simplicity returns to truth, its winding streams irrigating the Jade Fountain. The form dwells in the Hall of Vast Cold, rainbows reflecting upon the vermilion carriage. The paulownia-gut exhales essence, the Eastern Well refines the soul. The Five Thearchs’ crowns and sashes transform the visage into golden countenance. Cheeks serene and bright, one becomes a Jade Immortal. The Vermilion Numen Lesser Yang enables my spontaneity. Golden wings adorn and array, feathered robes gleam at dawn. Soaring aloft through the void, one sips from the sun’s root. The body mirrors water essence, radiance rejoicing in the dragon carriage. The feathered chariot arrives to welcome, ascending to stand before the Jade Emperor.

Upon completion, ingest the Ninefold-Refined Dragon Radiance talisman, swallow *qi* ninety times, and swallow saliva twenty-four times.

Whenever cultivating this Dao, at evening repose, from the day of Autumn’s Beginning to Winter’s Beginning, with both hands grasp the two shoulders thirty-two times each. The sun rests within the left shoulder’s well, the moon within the right shoulder’s well, their twin lights illuminating and enveloping the body. Knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

*Left sun, right moon,
Twin radiance oversee the numinous.
At dusk rest in Lesser Yang,
At dawn ascend to Jade Purity.
The Three Hun guard the chamber,
The Seven Po unite in form.
Myriad spirits assist and flank,
With radiance equal and aligned.*

Upon completion, lie down. Practicing this for eight years, the entire body becomes luminous, the face emanating the essence of azure brilliance. One speaks in unison with Lesser Yang, descending green carriages, soaring through the mysterious void, ascending to Jade Purity.

Within the Palace of Vast Cold grows the Azure Flower Grove, towering four thousand *zhang*, its branches spanning one thousand two hundred *li*, its garden two hundred forty *li* in circumference. Its leaves resemble bamboo yet are crimson, its blossoms resemble mirrors yet gleam, its fruit resembles plums yet bears no pit—this is the Crimson Tree with Cinnabar Fruit. Consuming its leaves grants ten thousand years of life; consuming its blossoms, one shares the sun’s numinosity; consuming its fruit, one feasts and wanders in Jade Purity.

Above perches the Golden-Winged Bird, its wings fanning rain across the realm. Below lies the Vast Cold’s Pool, where naturally arises the Ninefold-Refined Vast Fountain, five thousand *li* in depth and breadth. The Supreme Perfected Thearchs and Lofty Immortal Perfected Ones all ascend to the Palace of Vast Cold on Winter’s Beginning, plucking azure blossoms to anoint themselves, approaching the Vast Cold’s Pool to bathe in the Vast Fountain and refine their truth.

All later adepts who achieve the Dao and whose seven generations of ancestors are due to ascend to the celestial halls must pass through the Palace of Vast Cold, enter the Ninefold-Refined Pool, undergo refinement, and then ascend to heaven. After completing the refinement, they may consume the blossoms and fruit of the Azure Grove. The Golden-Winged Birds weave their feathered robes into garments for flying immortals, bestowing them upon those who undergo refinement, to ascend to the Upper Palace of Jade Purity.

Here ends the *Supreme Secret Essentials*, Scroll Ninety-Seven, excerpted from the *Original Beginning’s Transformations and Veritable Perfected Upper Scripture*.

**Supreme Secret Essentials, Scroll Ninety-Eight**
**Chapter on Ascending the Nine Heavens**

In the second month, receive the qi of the Unarrogant Joyous Heaven. On the fifth day at dawn, the fifteenth at noon, and the twenty-fifth at midnight—three days in the month, three times each—bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Bow nine times to the Northwest toward the Primordial Father, then three times to the Southeast toward the Mysterious Mother. Return to sit upright facing the moon’s position, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize invoking the Heavenly King of Unarrogant Joy, whose surname is *Ning* and whose taboo name is *Fuhuo*. He wears a nine-colored robe patterned with flying frost and cloud motifs, and a crown of Azure Blossom and the Essence of Jupiter. He rides a chariot of white deer and cinnabar clouds, accompanied by twenty-six Jade Immortals from the Upper Palace, descending into the Purple Tenuity Palace within your body. Visualize a canopy of azure cloud-qi raining down upon your form.

After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into the mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly recite the incantation:
*"Threefold union forms the warp,
Three numina harmonize in peace.
Nine Perfected flow downward,
Sun and moon spread their wings.
Seven stars cast mysterious radiance,
Five lodges revolve their canopy.
Three Passes shine brightly,
Myriad spirits wear their sashes.
Nine apertures purify and open,
Six palaces receive their irrigation.
Inner flourishing, outer ease,
Penetrating vision without bounds.
Long preserve heaven and earth,
Eternally partake of the Four Greatnesses."*

Conclude by swallowing the qi nine times and the saliva nine times. Practicing this for three years, the liver’s network will bind with purple threads, jade splendor will arise within, and inner and outer clarity will merge. You will perceive the yet-unmanifest in reverse, and after nine years, the numinous will descend, allowing you to ascend and fly to the Nine Heavens.

In the third month, receive the qi of the Tranquil Heaven. On the sixth day at dawn, the sixteenth at noon, and the twenty-sixth at midnight—three days in the month, three times each—bathe in fragrant waters, enter the chamber, and burn incense. Bow nine times to the Northwest toward the Primordial Father, then three times to the Southeast toward the Mysterious Mother. Return to sit upright facing the moon’s position, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes, and visualize invoking the Heavenly King of Tranquility, whose surname is *Jin* and whose taboo name is *Pendi*. He wears a seven-colored robe woven with dragon patterns and permeating light, and a crown of Yin Essence and night’s radiance. He rides the Eightfold Radiance Flying Wheel, accompanied by twelve Jade Immortals, descending into the Longevity Palace within your body. Visualize a dense canopy of verdant cloud-qi enveloping your form.

After a long while, draw the cloud-qi into the mouth and swallow it nine times, then softly recite the incantation:
*"The Supreme Dao is profound and obscure,
Mysterious qi subtly divides..."*

Nine and Five unfold their currents,
Eight Convergences command the Gate of Life.
In the Cinnabar Palace dwells the Red Child,
receiving qi from the Lord Emperor.
Peach-Longevity’s register of life
is presented before the Three Origins.
All Perfected Ones oversee and reflect,
refining the treasury of the hun-soul and po-soul.
Within, it gleams fresh; without, it radiates light,
spirit guarding the hidden passes.
Eight Radiant Scenes flank the body,
Nine Qi descend in clouds.
Soaring through the Mysterious Void,
ascending to the Emperor’s Gate.
Conclude by swallowing qi nine times.

the nine apertures absorb numinous power,
and one may converse with the Red Child.
After nine years, one obtains the ability to ride the dark cloud and purple canopy,
ascending to the Nine Heavens.

*—Excerpted from the *Dongzhen Waiguo Fangpin Jing***

The Nine Heavens’ *Poling Taixiao Yinsheng Shangjing* talisman is inscribed upon golden tablets within the iridescent yin radiance, serving as the pivot of the Nine Heavens’ gates and the canopy of the Supreme Clarity. Without this script, there would be no alternation of day and night; without this script in the Great Void, there would be no Supreme Clarity. Thus, the Primordial Beginning inscribed the script upon golden tablets, naming it the *Supreme Clarity Golden Characters and Jade Script*. Its sounds are the inner names of the celestial *po*. Practicing its Dao and ingesting its script, after nine years, the Soul-Numinous Imperial Lords and the Nine Heavens’ Chancellors will descend in a white *luan*-cloud chariot to one’s chamber, bestowing the divine Dao of the Three Departments and Eight Radiant Ones, enabling one to traverse the void, ascend to the Nine Heavens, and soar through the skies.

**Fivefold Elixir of the Cavernous Origin**

Take five fen of *ju teng* (bitter bamboo), three fen of *wei xi* (thunder god vine), two fen of *shu jiao* (Sichuan pepper), one fen of *gan jiang* (dried ginger), and one fen of *chang pu* (sweet flag). Select only the finest, freshest ingredients, cleanse them thoroughly, and pound them on a *wang xiang* day with a male child’s pestle—do not change the method. Prepare each separately, then sift finely. Pound each of the five ingredients ten thousand times, place them in separate red cups, arrange the five cups on a red table, and expose them to the open air for one night. At dawn the next day, divide them with a sacred dipper and combine them according to the method.

Mix with white honey or maltose, then pound again thirty thousand times, forming pills the size of *wu* seeds. At dawn, face the sun, kneel, and swallow three pills, saying: *"May my deepest wishes be fulfilled."* At dusk, kneel facing west and swallow three more pills in the same manner, making this a regular practice. Abstain from raw fish, pork, meat, and pungent vegetables; avoid encountering corpses, pigs, dogs, or childbirth filth—be vigilant!

The cycle begins on *jiazi* and ends on *guihai*, with the celestial stems and earthly branches as the appointed time—do not neglect or forget. Sixty-one nodes mark the constant rhythm of Heaven and Earth. Follow the regimen precisely: from *jia* to *gui* constitutes one node. If *jiazi* does not fall on a *jian* day, completing the full cycle is also acceptable. Before taking the elixir, fast for three days, burn incense, and meditate upon the spirits, then proceed.

*(From the* **Scripture of the Five Talismans of the Cavernous Origin***)*

The Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord said: To inscribe your name upon the white tablets of the Mysterious Register and ascend to the Jade Clarity’s Upper Palace, on the first day of the first month at the hour of *shanghe*, bathe and fast, then at dawn enter your chamber. Burn incense, face north, and bow nine times in homage to the Jade Heaven. Once done, sit facing north, click your teeth nine times, and visualize within your fasting chamber a cloud of azure *qi* rising luxuriantly, filling the room. Envision the Five Elder Immortals within the azure cloud, clad in flying azure feathered robes, crowned with *tongtian* jade coronets, holding the azure-script registers. The Jade Immortal Lords wear cloud-brocade robes, seven-jeweled jade crowns, and hold white silver tablets. Visualize the two perfected ones recording your name upon the white tablets and binding it into the azure-script register. Then, entrust your tablet and register to the Supervising Perfected Envoys and the Left Immortal of the Fixed Register, who will inscribe them beneath the mechanism of the Seven Sages of the Nine Heavens’ Imperial Kings. Once your name is fixed upon the tablet and register, the Five Elder Immortals and the Jade Immortal Lords will merge into the Hall of Light within your body. Then recite the incantation:

On the day of *shanghe*, the Celestial Origin is solemn and clear.
The Most High’s luminous canopy, the Jade Emperor descends to the court.
The Nine Perfected command the void, the Seven Sages unite in spirit.
Inscribe upon the Mysterious Register, record the name upon the white tablet,
Engrave the Primordial Record, carve life from death.
The Western Tortoise binds the register, preserving the immortal’s azure splendor.
Receive the cloud sash above, the five forms shine brilliantly.
Bestow upon me feathered robes, send down my green chariot.
Grant me to ride the flying clouds, ascend to the Purple Jade.
The Three Luminaries merge their light, the Seven Origins share their radiance.
Eternally preserve the Two Modes, Heaven and Earth endure as one.

After reciting, bow seven times in homage to the Seven Sages, swallow seven breaths, and cease. This is the method of the Most High for forging karmic ties and inscribing the tablets of the Six Harmonies. Practicing it for seven years, even those without a name in the Mysterious Register will have it engraved therein. The Three Origins descend, the Four Poles awaken their numen, and one naturally attains penetration, able to fly and ascend into the Grand Clarity.

The *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles of the Great Mysterious Capital* states: The *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* of the Most High Great Tenuity Heavenly Emperor Lord’s cultivation of the Eight Dao and Nine Perfected’s *Jielin Yuyi* method for ascending to the sun and moon was transmitted to the Central Yellow Elder Lord and concealed within the Six Harmonies Palace of the Most High. According to the old regulations, one may receive three transmissions in seven thousand years. If one bears the azure script of Eastern Florescence and the jade characters of the Upper Clarity, and is a purple-net-enshrined living being, one may receive three transmissions within seven hundred years. The oath requires: ninety feet of silk, one catty of azure thread, and twenty-four feet of crimson silk—this is the oath of the sun’s radiance.

Twenty-four feet of green silk—this is the oath of the moon’s radiance. Three pairs of golden rings—this is the oath of the Ageless Youths. Facing north, one performs the oath-transmission on the ninth and twenty-fourth days of the fast, with seventeen jade boys and seventeen jade maidens in attendance. Cultivating this Dao for seven years, one rides a dragon in flight and ascends to the Great Clarity. Its method is especially weighty: two transgressions sever merit and cut off affairs; four transgressions incur the scrutiny of the Left and Right Officials. For oneself and seven generations of ancestors, punishment is meted out in the Three Torments of the Hell of Knife Mountains and Fire-Eating—ten thousand kalpas of rebirth, never to enter the Dao of humanity. The *Green Statutes of the Left Palace of the Mysterious Capital* states: those who seek it must reverently and cautiously uphold it.

—End of *Supreme Mysteries*, Scroll Ninety-Nine
*Supreme Mysteries*, Scroll One Hundred: *Ascending the Formless*

The Most High Sage Emperor Lord said: To inscribe your name in the Mysterious Register and return to the Nine Empyreans of Heaven, at the hour of *shanghe* on the fifth day of the fifth month, bathe and fast in purity, compose the mind and enter the chamber. Burn incense, face north, and bow nine times in homage to the Jade Heaven. When finished, face north, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize within the fasting chamber a cloud of cinnabar qi, empty yet radiant, filling the room. Envision the Five Elder Immortals within the cinnabar cloud, draped in flying azure robes, crowned with *Tongtian* jade coronets, holding green-script registers. The Attendant Immortal Jade Lords wear cloud-brocade robes, seven-jeweled jade crowns, and hold white-script tablets. Visualize the Two Perfected recording your name upon the white tablet, binding it into the green-script register. Hand your inscribed tablet to the Supervising Perfected Messenger to be recorded by the Left Immortal Prime Minister under the Seven Sages of the Nine Heavenly Emperor Kings. Once the tablet is inscribed and the name fixed, the Five Elder Immortals lead the Jade Lords to merge into your Crimson Palace. Silently intone:

*"Vermilion brightness of the Southern Cinnabar,
Joyous union with the Upper Yang.
Celestial origin conjoins in harmony,
Six aspirations flourish within.
Nine Perfected and Seven Sages,
Fast in the numinous jade hall.
Inscribe upon the Mysterious Tablet,
Bind the register of the Western Palace.
Carve the correct script, sounding clearly,
Illuminating the four directions.
Cinnabar clouds return through the empyrean,
Descending into my chamber.
Flying azure plumes, winged and radiant,
Left spurs the vermilion phoenix,
Right reins the roaming dragon.
Six bridles lift as one,
Transcending to ascend the Flowering Hall.
Five Elders hold the covenant,
Four Poles stand in paired symmetry.
Eternally preserve the Mysterious Splendor,
Sun and moon share the same visage."*

When finished, bow seven times in homage to the Seven Sages and swallow seven breaths to conclude. Practicing this for seven years, your name as one who has attained the Dao will be fixed in the Upper Palace, the Nine Empyreans will shine in reflection, and you will ascend into the formless.

—From the *Scripture of the Primordial Register of the Seven Sages of the Cavernous Realms*

The Dao states: Those who cultivate this scripture and attain the rank of Upper Immortal will fly and ascend into the void, their bodies becoming formless, forever one with the Dao.

—From the *Scriptural Instructions on the Natural Dao of the Cavernous Origin*

Recite the homage to all heavens once,
Ten recitations revive withered bones to life.
Seven Mysteries ascend to the Vermilion Palace,
Enjoying blessings and entering the formless.

—From the *Scripture of the Numinous Stanzas of the Cavernous Origin*

The virtue of the Great Sage and host of Perfected Ones, after attaining the Dao, ascends into the formless and merges with the Dao as one.

—From the *Scripture of the Yellow Register and Simplified Writ of the Cavernous Origin*

*Responding to Transformations*

The Highest Jade Emperor, Most Sage Emperor Lord, and Nine Heavenly Jade Perfected all receive qi naturally, lodge in jade wombs, conceal brilliance in the Purple Origin, and through numinous harmony and resonance, become human. Descendants of the imperial lineage, born as perfected beings, they structure emptiness into script and harmonize the Three Qi into names. Invested with imperial titles, they respond and transform in the Upper Clarity, governing the lofty void of immortals, presiding over the Mysterious Mystery. With the passage of the four seasons, they adapt to cyclical changes, bathing, donning crowns and sashes, refining and adorning eternal talismans. They transform forms and appearances, responding to stimuli and coming into being. In the obscure and indistinct, the Dao has no constant name—profound and unfathomable, subtle and inexhaustible. Heaven and Earth model themselves upon it to establish the Great Mystery, aligning to achieve purity. Sun and moon rely upon it to illuminate the Five Agents, receiving its numinous power to attain spirituality. Vast and towering, its virtue’s source; boundless and exalted, its lofty honor. Its Dao is supremely wondrous, beyond all comparison.

The Primordial Beginning records and conceals it within the Six Harmonies Palace of the Most High. Later sages and students of the Upper Perfected’s Dao must refine and master the Primordial Beginning’s transformative forms, adapting to seasonal changes to communicate with the real, return their qi, and refine their spirits. For example, the Primordial Beginning’s August Elder assumes the qi of the Jade Void of the Primordial Beginning on the day of *Lichun* and receives the title of August Elder, embodying true form, wearing robes of proper colors, and residing in the true and upright for the ninety days of spring. On the day of *Lixia*, the August Elder transforms, receiving the seasonal change, bathing in the numinous and real, altering form and appearance to communicate with the real and absorb the numinous, ensuring qi’s eternal presence. During the ninety days of summer, the immortal soul bathes, and the numinous and real resonate. On the day of *Liqiu*, the August Elder transforms again with the season, donning the Five Constants’ crown and sash, called "immortal transformation." Qi flows through the Mysterious Mystery, filling within and overflowing without, radiance shining forth, transforming the real and nurturing qi to ensure its endlessness. During the ninety days of autumn, crowned with the Nine Heavens and transformed into an immortal, the real is perfected. On the day of *Lidong*, the August Elder unites true embryonic breathing, returning qi to its natural state, liberating form and spirit, transforming appearance into light, returning to the Primordial Beginning, refining and returning essence, nurturing and polishing the numinous and real. Light and color blend into chaos, like misty clouds. During the ninety days of winter, qi congeals and spirit coalesces, restoring the original form. After four cycles, the year completes and renews—this is the Primordial Beginning’s four transformations, adapting to seasonal changes. The movements of Heaven and Earth all have flourishing and decline, closure and opening, rest and activity, responding to the Celestial Pass. In flourishing, they preside upright; in rest, they nurture and cultivate, donning crowns and refining essence, never losing constancy.

The Dao/Way is eternal and boundless—this is the wondrous transformation’s essence.

From *The Upper Clarity Primordial Beginning’s Transformations: Original Scrolls* (上清元始變化元箓), the True Person says:
*"Having received the Sacred Treasure’s true scriptures,
practice this fast,
and first attain this great blessing for others—
thus, prioritizing others over oneself,
lying prone in forgetfulness,
and aspiring to the forgotten state,
where one’s body aligns with the Mysterious Unity."*

From *The Scripture on Spreading the Fast of the Primordial Beginning* (洞元敷齋經), it is written:
*"Guilt and fortune do not arise from others,
but spring forth from one’s own self.
The great sage thus seals his lips,
to sever all ties with malevolent causes.
Extinguishing thought, he returns to forgetfulness,
lying prone while awaiting the eternal dissolution."*

From *The Scripture on Establishing the Aspiration of the Primordial Beginning* (洞元安志經):
*"Refine the embryo and return to the Original Beginning,
ascend the Heavenly Bridge of long transcendence.
Nurturing and storing [qi] squanders the Heavenly True,
while scattered thoughts invite the common fate.
Severing the fettering womb-tree’s roots,
the mind soars beyond the Upper Capital.
The aspiration to the Mysterious Unity is fulfilled,
enlightening me to the forgotten Dao/Way and its essence."*

From *The Nine Heavens Scripture of the Primordial Beginning* (洞元九天經), the Humanly Natural says:
*"The Dao/Way is the True of nature.
Non-action is the Dao/Way’s ultimate.
Emptiness and non-existence are virtue’s highest honor.
Dullness and stagnation are virtue’s abode.
Silence and quiescence are virtue’s depths.
Purity and stillness are the mind’s neighbor.
Sincerity and integrity are the mind’s gate.
Harmony and moderation are the origin of all affairs.
Thus, one who practices the Dao/Way naturally
attains its name through nature itself.
One who masters non-action
secures longevity in life.
One who embodies emptiness and non-existence
allows the qi to flow unimpeded.
One who dwells in dullness and stagnation
shares in the eternal aspiration.
One who abides in silence and quiescence
conceals the voice within.
One who cultivates purity and stillness
illuminates the mind.
One who embodies sincerity and integrity
preserves the aspiration.
One who harmonizes and moderates
transforms into the Dao/Way’s essence itself.

Therefore, in practicing the Dao/Way,
one must first establish the natural.
I previously taught this to the Official’s Attendant, Em Yin,
and composed two chapters on the Dao/Way and virtue.
As I departed, I admonished him:
‘The Dao/Way is natural.
Those who attain it know its natural state,
while those who do not know neither its origin nor its essence.
It is like recognizing sound—
one who knows it by the ear
cannot fathom the depths of human hearts;
one who knows it by the mouth
cannot speak its marvels.
The Dao/Way’s endless expanse
cannot be fully expressed in words,
nor can words fully capture its meaning.
I wrote for you
to awaken your understanding of the natural,
so that upon attaining it, you may nurture it yourself.’

Em Yin asked: ‘How does one learn the natural Dao/Way?’
The Dao/Way replied: ‘Take nothing—
the upright qi will dwell within you;
reject nothing—
the perverse qi will depart of its own accord.
This is not the way of petitioning spirits and gods,
nor is it to repel impurities and banish the unnatural.
Purity and stillness prolong life without bound—
how is this not the natural Dao/Way?
It is not my peculiar method,
nor my solitary path.
If the Dao/Way is not natural,
what Dao/Way is it?
Non-action and non-desire—
the Dao/Way’s true application.
Emptiness and non-existence—
the Dao/Way’s abiding place.
Silence and quiescence—
the Dao/Way’s ultimate state.
Dullness and tranquility—
virtue’s gradual cultivation.
Purity and stillness—
the mind’s dwelling.
Sincerity and integrity—
the mind’s adornment.
Harmony and moderation—
the mind’s transformation.

Nurture the body through non-action,
settle the mind in emptiness,
preserve the aspiration in dullness,
cultivate the voice in silence,
calm the heart in purity,
maintain the aspiration in sincerity,
and sustain the mind in harmony.
Let the heart dwell undisturbed,
as vast waters naturally settle deep.
Let the mind reside still,
as the dragon naturally hides in its lair.
Embrace emptiness without becoming void,
cling without being bound—
like the Southern Star’s forgetfulness of emptiness.
Transform virtue and preserve the mind,
as the ancestral altars safeguard their radiance.
Establish the mind’s highest clarity,
as the ancestral halls guard their sacred essence.
Make the world not see you,
like the great fish in the great waters.
Make others not know you,
like the sun’s rising light in the east.
My boundless nature
resonates with the Dao/Way’s root,
comparable to how mountains, forests, and great marshes
naturally gather beasts and wolves,
or how deep woods and vast trees
naturally attract flying birds and myriad creatures,
or how the Red Lake
naturally draws fish, tortoises, dragons, and serpents,
or how great virtue
naturally summons the auspicious麒麟 (qílín), phoenix, and crane,
or how purity and whiteness
naturally invite the jade maidens and immortal plants,
or how harmony and blessed omens
naturally bring forth good fortune,
or how calamities and malevolent qi
naturally invite disaster and misfortune.’*

From *The Scripture of the Wondrous True* (妙真經):
*"Ascend to the skies, grasp the elixir,
roam and feast in the Purple Morn.
Hold the cosmic currents, retain the years,
and eternally enjoy the natural Dao/Way.*

*The Dao/Way scriptures say:
‘Humans emulate Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven conforms to the Dao/Way,
and the Dao/Way follows nature.’*

From *The Scripture on the Empty Cavern’s Mysterious Chapter* (洞元空洞靈章經):
*"Floating on the vast Empty Peak,
the celestial scenery flows in the Upper Mysterious.
The beginning’s end is beyond all kalpas,
eternally preserving Heaven and Earth’s completeness.
The world’s rulers study to achieve the dharma,
while Dao/Wayists chant to attain immortality.
The worthy now receive and uphold this teaching,
transmitting it according to its law.
In the absence of one with supreme virtue,
guard its secrets and do not proclaim them recklessly.
The faithful shall ascend to the Upper Clarity,
while the abandoned shall descend to the Nine Abyss.
I speak of the Dao/Way of non-action,
purity and stillness attaining the natural.’*

From *The Mysterious Commentary on the Great Dao/Way* (洞元太極隱注):
*"The Dao/Way’s words:
‘The True Person embodies the void’s penetration,
uniting with the Dao/Way’s essence,
aligning with nature itself—
omnipotent, omniscient,
omnipenetrating.’"*

The sovereigns of the Dao/Way each have their own realm,
The True Ones each possess their own palace.

In stillness, the radiant clouds arise from the Upper Clarity,
In obscurity, the boundless void sustains the Great Emptiness.

The penetrating transformation occurs within the Vermilion Cloud Cavern,
The boundless expanse connects to the Nine Mysteries.

In silent contemplation, one grasps the stillness and attains the ultimate—
The Eight Scenes enable flight through the void.

The Great Penetration encompasses the Three Categories,
With transformations both formless and form-replete.

The stillness of the rootless teaching,
In its austerity, holds profound and numinous power.

From *The Nine Dao/Way Paths of the Mysterious True Return* (洞真回元九道经):
There is a substance that blends into unity,
Born before Heaven and Earth,
Silent and boundless,
Independent yet unchanging,
Circulating eternally without ceasing,
It can be the mother of all under Heaven.

---
From *The Dao/Way Classic of the Old Master* (老子道经):
The Old Master of the Kunlun Peaks rules the center,
Ascending to the Heavenly Summit.
Within the Seven Treasures Moral Vision of the Dao,
He summoned the Dao/Wayist Erling and said to him:
"My Dao/Way originates from the void’s emptiness,
Before the Great Beginning itself,
With no source from which it arises,
Yet it is subtle and does not manifest form.

In the past, I received the wondrous law upon this peak.
With my keen intelligence and wisdom, I gathered my intent and followed it.
Having purified my body for the Dao/Way, I attained subtle and profound penetration.
Seeking the Dao/Way to ascend as an immortal,
I achieved the name of one who follows the Dao/Way’s traces.

Now, seek immortality among immortals,
Seek divinity among gods,
Seek the Dao/Way among the Dao/Way.
Do not seek *nirvana* (灭度),
And you shall grasp the void’s essential principle.

Emptiness, silence, and stillness—
These are the Dao/Way’s core.
The ultimate Dao/Way is ever profound and silent;
Words spoken cannot capture its truth.

Taking and discarding show no deviation,
Endlessly sustaining the substance of things.
The method of the formless penetration is understood,
Yet the god of the middle realm is also recognized.
Coming and going lack thought,
Forgetfulness aligns with all existence.

---
From *The Classic of Ascending to the Origin* (升元经):
To learn immortality, abandon all worldly attachments.
Each thought, if sustained, accumulates.

Coming and going disrupt my spirit,
My restless spirit wanders without end.
Extinguish thought and rest in the void’s tranquility,
In stillness, enter the boundless emptiness.

Receive the scriptures as one parched and thirsty,
Hold your resolve like iron and stone.
Preserve the child to walk the immortal path,
The Five Spirits (五灵) and the talismans of transcendence.

The Old Master’s profound and silent teachings,
Expounding the Dao/Way, revering its scriptures.
With reverence and humility, I have attained immortality,
Through countless kalpas, my lifespan is boundless.

The towering virtue of the Great True One,
In stillness, it originates from the formless.
The celestial scenery constructs the void’s framework,
Riding the emptiness, one naturally advances.

The sun and moon shine as radiant symbols,
In perfect harmony, joy endures forever.

The words of the Old Master’s profound mystery,
The Three Penetrations (三洞) of the initial origin,
Are subtle yet difficult to hear,
Luminous and silent, encompassing all virtues.
The lofty and revered, the ultimate true,
Where all wondrous things reside—
The gateway to all mysteries.

---
The Mysterious True Person (太玄真人) said:
All these teachings should be exhausted in emptiness,
With form and formlessness intermingling.
Cultivate virtue and nourish the spirit,
Accumulate emptiness and condense the true.
The true body shall then be established,
Entering and exiting form and formlessness,
Hidden in stillness, reaching the utmost mystery.

---
From *The Classic of the Dao/Way’s Traces* (道迹经):
What endures forever in its Dao/Way is *nourishing life* (养生).
What remains constant in its communion with the eternal is *receiving qi* (纳气).
When the *qi* is complete, life is sustained,
Then one can nourish.
When nourishment reaches its peak, one unites with the true,
Then one can eternally ascend to the realm of life-giving *qi*,
Gazing upon the stillness of complete nourishment,
Fully relying on the borrowed and the lodged.

---
From *The True Admonitions* (真诰):
Human life is like an illusion,
Temporarily dwelling between Heaven and Earth.
If one gathers *qi* and cultivates the spirit,
With earnestness pouring into the true,
One may attain the eternal Dao/Way.

When the Dao/Way is complete, it aligns with all,
Sharing existence with Heaven and Earth,
Dwelling within the Great Non-being (太无).

If one penetrates the void and embodies the formless,
One merges with the Great Non-being,
Dwelling within the silent stillness.

Those who can penetrate the stillness—
They are invisible when seen,
Unheard when listened to.
