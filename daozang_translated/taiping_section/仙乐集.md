**Twenty-Nine "White Lotus Flower" Lyrics**
A century of life swiftly awakens,
thirty-six thousand days allotted.
Day and night, the sun and moon rush—
when the limit arrives, death’s path is inescapable.
Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.
Yet there exists a lead chamber, a mercury treasury—
a single point of numinous clarity is master.
The Dao’s joy is dustless, carefree;
in delight, one sings and dances the Dao.
Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.
Revering the Dao, the exalted perfected protect and shelter,
preserving life, the body rests in simplicity.
Malice and filth vanish, deeds cease;
the sagely Dao is hard to encounter, hard to meet.
Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.

The Dao rescues the nine lineages and seven ancestors—
a path to Penglai lies near at hand.
The Three Teachings’ gates of transcendence,
the immortal Dao—once met in a thousand years.

Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.
Beyond the world, immortal palaces and precious realms—
attaining the Dao, the true and numinous dwell forever.
Spreading virtue, their names endure through ages;
who awakens to save the dying and mourn the living?

Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.
Grand offerings deliver departed souls, sagely salvation—
in drought, the rare Dharma-rain is hard to meet.
With purity, body and mind feast on simplicity;
merit perfected, the immortal path is complete.

Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the cycle of rebirth.
When the flame of nature and oil of life awaken,
this is the wondrous joy of true life.
Cultivating the Dao’s qi to firmness,
a path to Penglai’s immortal land appears.

Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.
Thoughts tangled in a thousand threads,
well-fed and clothed, yet still unenlightened.
One day, impermanence strides alone—
when the soul scatters, who escapes the dark path?

Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.
With virtue, be humble; with anger, be sparing—
never scorn poverty nor crave wealth.

All things embrace the myriad voices,
moving the high heavens and sacred ancestors.
Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.

In this life, to be noble and wealthy,
must be from past-life awakening.
Yet fear the descent into the three wretched realms and dark courts—
before heaven’s cycle is complete, one meets again.
Since ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;
they too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.

The seven treasures pass like Mount Sumeru,
yet has the Dao’s fruit ripened?
Awaken early to the wondrous principle of the Diamond,
and you cross the river to transcendence.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

Those who fail to grasp yin-yang study the *Yi*,
but those enlightened pierce heaven and earth.
Weary of the turbid, they emerge in stillness—
how many through the ages have guarded the Dao?
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
the great image gathers at the Jade Flower Assembly.

The Dao’s subtlety is pure emptiness, awakened wisdom,
responding like a gushing spring, fulfilled in meaning.
Only keep your heart unobscured,
and you merge with the five thousand profound principles.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

Some delight in reading, then drowse in sleep,
rejoicing beneath the pines beyond the cave.
Preserve life, nurture spirit, cultivate qi,
embrace the One to avoid sinking as a lowly ghost.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

The autumn moon clears the deep pool to its depths,
revealing a perfect radiance that illumines the body.
The two eights remain unbroken—true joy—
casting off all, one walks without fault.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

The deluded slander through many lives,
clinging to beauty, coveting wealth, contending in qi.
One day, impermanence comes, and they regret—
the Five-Seven Kings of Hell demand their due.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

The karmic mirror appears before you,
brows knit, tears falling.
No use now to argue with the wisdom of life—

Here at last, even children and grandchildren cannot take your place.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

Sudden awakening in the blessed mountains and sacred lands,
a life of cloud and water, zither and books.
One thought of non-arising—no fault remains.
How many through the ages have attained this?
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

Gain and loss span heaven and earth,
yet not an inch returns in the next life.
Soul and spirit perish to become ghosts,
while nature and destiny preserved become immortals with ease.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

Unmatched joy in serene clarity,
bliss among rocks and pines.
Cranes dance and phoenixes welcome—only delight,
refining the elixir’s radiance, shedding the husk.
When the Dao is whole and virtue noble,
all ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.

Since the primal chaos, the myriad things endure,
dying and living—how long does it last?
A single true spirit never perishes,
its destiny tied to the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

Ancestors long sunken in the dark path,
with no gate to escape hell.
Above, the Ten Directions save from suffering,
while countless beings create karma.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

Born, aged, sick, suffering—then death,
falling into the hellish courts of the underworld.
Only for failing to awaken in life,
hurried onto the knife mountains and sword trees.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

The Ox-Head jailers rage in fury,
here, words cannot plead your case.

Suffering knows no pause nor rest,
tongues torn out for slandering masters in life.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

Sunken in the dark paths of the netherworld,
where is the sunlight of the yang realm?
Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives enduring torment,
the ten evils mark their countless numbers.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

Between heaven above and the human world below,
only lust, envy, and jealousy are loved.
When pleasure reaches its peak, sickness and suffering cannot be escaped,
the po soul scatters, the hun soul fades, and one returns to earth.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

Beholding the tombs of Beimang’s hills,
how many of the ancient noble and wealthy?
When the limit comes, how can one flee?
Suddenly awakening to the Primordial Dao Ancestor.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

The transcendent immortals’ joyous abode beyond the world,
where wondrous scenes know no four seasons.
Those who attain the Dao truly transcend cold and heat,
the perfected who accumulate merit save from suffering.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

Arriving at the famed mountains and grottoes,
with bamboo hat and staff, one strolls at ease.
Recognizing the Golden Crow and Jade Hare,
yet the wondrous awakening binds the foolish ape.
Descendants meet again through ritual connection,
reverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.

[In Response to Xun Tai Anyuan]
Xun Tai Anyuan and all kin,
at Lingxu Abbey aiding the ritual’s cause,
repay with this poem.

Long life and salvation are not yet deemed worthy,
manifesting in the human realm, one willingly offers wealth.
The Yellow Register Ritual completed, souls are delivered,
at Lingxu Abbey, the good affinity is realized.
A hundred mornings of accumulated practice illuminate the three days,
a thousand days of cultivated merit honor ten thousand years.
Above, repay the Four Graces by perfecting virtue and power,
without transgression, preserve life and avoid the dark springs.

Linked-Rhyme Poems

[Year] Each spring after, flowers again wither,
[Wither] the scene fades, trees and grasses all complete.
[Complete] The Dao’s wisdom discerns no beauty or ugliness,
understanding the true and pure intent distinguishes fool from sage.
[Sage] The worthy, sword at back, roam cloudy grottoes,
the enlightened, zither in hand, dwell by brocade rivers.
[Rivers] Nearby, Zhongnan’s bamboo stretches for ten thousand acres,
come to the world beyond to discourse on long years.

Here the immortal’s hand plants flowers that never fade,
With little effort, lingzhi herbs grow in the shade.
Through years of self-refinement, dwelling in grotto-heavens bright,
The Dao’s true cultivation shines beyond the dust’s dull blight.

Before noon and after seem as one fleeting span,
Ever joyful, gazing upon Zhuangzi’s and Laozi’s plan.
Before dawn’s first light, the hour of *yin* is known,
All signs revealed in clarity, the hidden truths are shown.

O’er seas the raven flies, bearing jade mercury’s flight,
Across the sky the hare pounds gold, ever new and bright.
Its radiance outshines the world’s most splendid scene,
No earthly garden’s spring can match this realm serene.

From moon to moon, past and present tales unfold,
Seeking the young and simple, where death and life are one, untold.
Forsaking fame and gain, descending from the lofty height,
Through *jia*, *geng*, and *bing*, embracing cold and heat’s full might.

Before late autumn, blossoms fill the balustrade,
Beyond the third summer’s end, fresh greens the platter lade.
Sipping jade nectar from dawn’s first light,
Offering rare delicacies till the dead of night.

Gazing toward the azure vault, the path beyond the clouds,
Riding phoenix and simurgh, pure joy abounds.
Beholding clear skies where even a speck of haze is gone,
The three and two unite, the heart’s ashes strewed anon.

Roaming wondrous lands, jesting with pines and bamboo,
Secluded in immortal gardens, chanting of plum and willow’s hue.
Witnessing late spring’s dream of birth and decay,
Encountering the waning moon, hastening heat and cold’s sway.

When you recognize the full light’s radiant glow,
The mirror’s truth reveals the hare’s ebb and flow.
Turning back the myriad beings, the treasure’s light renewed,
The axe cleaves the mountain, the jade maiden viewed.

Revolving the three yangs, golden stamens unfold,
Entwining the four forms, snow and spring’s tale retold.
As months come and go, meeting *ding-mao*’s sign,
In rites of dawn, encountering *wu-chen*’s time.

Donning cloud-robes, hidden in jade grottoes deep,
Refining through clouds, the nine heavens’ form to keep.
When the numinous comes, the treasure’s light is drawn,
When the awn departs, the white ox’s trace is gone.

The earth’s good cause unfolds from dusk to dawn,
The heart responds with constancy, firm yet gently drawn.
Golden cheeks inverted, dwelling on Lotus Peak,
To know the Dao, one must traverse the other shore’s mystique.

Beyond all cares, cultivating life and fate,
Discoursing on Fan Li, adrift in a single skiff’s estate.
Feasting on fine fare, urged by others’ haste,
Departing heaven’s kitchen, only to return with grace.

Beholding the infant, first glimpsing insight’s spark,
Hearing the maiden’s call, the head turns once more to mark.
Transmitting jade secrets, transcending *samadhi*’s bound,
Shooting forth golden light, illuminating both cheeks’ ground.

The Dao’s ebb and flow lie beyond heaven and earth,
Atop Yangtower, floating jade cups of mirth.
Before dawn’s first light, the truth of *yin* is clear,
Wandering immortal grottoes, where Penglai’s spring appears.

The moon hastens, urging the world’s fleeting scenes to fade,
Yet rites of leisure follow the Dao’s light, ever made.
The cloud-borne guest transmits mercury’s elixir’s art,
The alchemical classics’ secrets shared with those apart.

The treasure’s auspicious light reappears once more,
The infant attains freedom, stretching as before.
Entering principle, the true light concealed,
Beholding the pot’s sun and moon, their span revealed.

Donning cloud-robes, paying homage to the Dao’s source,
Feasting on millet, refining cinnabar’s force.
At midnight’s hour, the red candle’s glow is bright,
Before the fast’s descent, river incense takes flight.

In profound obscurity, only awakening’s key,
Thoughts of emerald bamboo lead to the cool hall’s spree.
Dragon coils, tiger reaches the hour of *yin*,
Hexagrams drawn anew, heralding fortune’s kin.

Awakening to seas and skies where clouds and waves amass,
Illuminating rivers and lands where frost and snow align, en masse.
The youth guides, playing amidst Penglai’s scene,
The maiden first roams Luo’s garden, where spring is serene.

The moon’s flight brings the changes of birth, age, decay,
Flowery adornments renew the world’s dust each day.
Seeking reclusion, dwelling in Qingcheng’s embrace,
The Dao’s way in the world brings compassion and grace.

Refining mercury and lead, discerning the false and true,
Discoursing on virtue and power, awakening to the genuine hue.
In pure accumulation, pitying the poor and low,
In radiant cultivation, cherishing the noble’s glow.

In use, no high or low, but balance’s art,
In dwelling, entering and exiting like scales impart.
The immortal’s music and Dao reside by clouds’ side,
The child idly chants verses from realms beyond the tide.

Binding and hanging light, transcending the nine lands,
Encroaching on vibrant scenes, reaching the three heavens’ strands.
Through changes, the celestial stems’ years are known,
Yet the laws of *jia-zi* cycles remain obscure, alone.

With three lives’ truths suddenly realized,
Knowing all distinctions dissolved marks the sage’s prize.
The body drifts, ethereal, to cloud-borne chariots,
The horse returns again—who awakens to past grievances’ targets?

Dragging away, clarity dawns: extreme favor breeds harm,
The heart’s resonance turns harm to favor’s balm.
Knowing Han’s generals meet the pure ancestor’s line,
Beholding Fufeng’s encounter with Taiyuan’s sign.

Secluded in mountains, the true one blends with the world’s guise,
Expounding the great scripture of five thousand words’ wise.
The true immortal of Penglai hides as a grotto guest,
Roaming, revealing traces, delighting in the worthy and best.

Comprehending the myriad wonders, fulfilling heaven’s will,
Awakening to a thousand mysteries, following nature’s skill.
Beholding the clear and peaceful, practicing virtue and power,
Hearing praises of the highest, perfecting benevolence each hour.

Cultivating the primal visage of the original state,
At life’s utmost, increasing blessings beyond measure’s weight.
Discoursing on the capital’s splendor, where great talents hide,
As cold departs and warmth returns, nature’s course abides.

Illuminating the Dao above, like stars that brightly gleam,
Awakening within the breast, like brocade’s rich seam.
Nurturing pines and bamboos through three seasons’ play,
Cultivating vibrant blossoms, urging four seasons’ sway.

Perfecting the myriad practices, ascending to the origin’s gate,
Contemplating the sages of old, whose virtue was truly great.
Roaming cloudy grottoes, where treasure’s light descends,
Departing to transcend the dust, with a separate fate that extends.

With a heart empty and full, no illness takes root,
With a belly replete, hunger is forgot.
Within and without, who truly sees?
Awakening to center and edge, how many know these?

Discoursing on heaven and hell, realms vast and wide,
Comprehending the supreme mystery, fitting and applied.
Rarely seen, the centenarian’s form,
The true guest ascends to azure heights, the heavens’ norm.

When crossbows lie idle, the land’s wealth abounds,
After chaos and desolation, few people are found.
Illuminating the covered and borne, bridging barbarian ways,
Revolving the celestial cycle, achieving sagely feats always.

Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—all honor the good Dao,
Barbarians rejoice, praising kings and lords’ sway.
The heart’s flow like Jinjiang’s river, smooth and clear,
Fire and water merge, like Han’s valiant peer.

Where goodness thrives, wind and hail are few,
Across the three realms, snow and frost accrue.
Comprehending vast accumulations of three thousand deeds,
Revolving subtle transmissions through twelve cycles’ leads.

The secret’s natural pivot and essence suddenly known,
Ever delighting in the Dao, singing and chanting its tone.
Below, the worthies gather, discoursing on past and present’s lore,
Only the enlightened are true kindred spirits evermore.

The hare’s pounding light awakens the Dao’s heart, free.
Intent transforms, vast as Mount Sumeru’s height,

Wherever clouds drift, immortal dwellings thrive,
Planting yellow sprouts when *ren* rains arrive.
In boundless obscurity, only awakening’s gate,
Thoughts of emerald bamboo lead to the cool hall’s state.

Returning to cloud-paths, the Yang Heaven’s way,
The Dao’s emptiness and nothingness—its root is Nature’s sway.
Descending jade crucible’s light brings swift awakening,
Unsealing the precious mirror—its words no tongue may convey.

Refining mercury’s elixir transcends life and death,
Mastering cinnabar script—no bias, no dearth.
The Dao treasures flowering, yet immortals’ path is true,
Immortals summon me to meet the worthy and the few.

I hear the mirage-sea transforms to clouded city’s form,
Pressing the Center’s *qi*—the Dao’s breath takes form.
The moon waxes full when *ren* rains nourish the land,
The year knows no lack where the Crimson Dragon plows the sand.

Through jade and mercury, yin and yang unite,
Gold and lead entwine—hemp and wheat take flight.

Liver, lungs, and kidneys—sun’s light, ever-ranging.
Not speech but greed—insatiable, without end,
My firefly glow burns the great thousand worlds to mend.

Smoke vanishes, the mixed world’s dwelling fades,
The grand yellow rite unfurls its purple shades.
Where clouds drift, the quail’s nature finds its home,
Death transcended, the fledgling leaves its nest alone.

Awakening to Fuxi’s three-stroke sign,
Illuminating the *Yi*’s hexagrams’ design.
Recognizing true inversion’s light,
The shore of non-action—being and non-being’s sight.

Years blend with the world, joy in tranquility’s embrace,
Refining true lead—virtue’s path finds its place.
In clouds, the scholar seeks seclusion’s way,
Beyond the material, near the lofty and the sage.

At the capital’s summit, the numinous breeze is cool,
By the grotto’s stream, the bright moon’s orb is full.
To taste the fruits the immortals offer,
Requires three thousand deeds of merit’s proffer.

Speaking truth of ascent—no return is seen,
The Lord of the Dao plants osmanthus in the moon’s sheen.
Where fragrant blooms of springtime fade,
Beyond, celestial flowers in four seasons parade.

Utmost harmony—dragons coil by the elixir’s well,
Truth draws cranes to the cinnabar terrace’s swell.
Illuminating truth, the morning’s origin is sought,
Contemplating *Nanhua*—what boundless thought!

The western crow’s fall—sun’s return is denied,
Speaking of impermanence—intent yet untried.
Seeing Yuanming come and go,
Hearing Ding Ling depart and return anew.

Gold in strange positions—spring’s willow before its time,
Rooster and dog in shared palace—winter’s plum in rime.
At the forbidden smoke’s advent, immortals awaken,
Sipping jade nectar—nectar divine, unshaken.

Beholding spring’s return as cold retreats,
Discoursing on mysteries—departing, then repeats.
Gold’s intervals—spiritual yang’s radiance,
Water’s union—*gui*’s moisture nurtures growth’s advance.

The world, deluded, cherishes the third month’s grace,
Now only I perceive the four seasons’ hastening pace.
The Lord enters the elixir—round light responds,
Mastering the mysterious origin—Laozi’s wisdom dawns.

Leaves and blossoms bloom by the sea’s shore,
Returning near the time of forbidden smoke once more.
Birth and death—all deluded by illusion’s guise,
Right and wrong—who awakens to truth’s prize?

Utmost emerald clouds ever my companion,
Wherever I roam, sages and worthies are my kin.
Gazing from Yang Terrace toward Chang’an’s road,
Guarding stillness—Hiyi’s truth forever bestowed.

Transgressions dissolved, blessings’ weight restored,
Mastering stillness—profound principle explored.
Within, refining cinnabar—the golden tripod gleams white,
Within, firing the crucible—the jade furnace burns bright.

Once the Dao is realized, I ascend to Queen Mother’s throne,
Bearing truth, I visit Lord Wood’s domain.
Departing, I carry the Three Clarities’ token,
Returning, astride a crane through nine skies, unbroken.

Roaming Penglai’s gardens, beholding flowers’ array,
On purple jade terraces, facing moon and wind’s ballet.
Corpse extinguished, death vanquished—no seasons remain,
Ever in harmony with the Dao’s *qi*, its flow sustained.

*Xianle Ji, Scroll Three*

**Four-Character Hymns by Liu Chuxuan of Wuying Immortal Mountain, Longshengzi—Expressing My Thoughts**

**I.**
Success achieved, body withdrawn,
Pure dwelling nurtures vastness.
By waters, near mountains,
Leisurely pondering Zhuang and Lao.
The land bears pines and bamboos,
Fine through all four seasons.
Deep within grotto-heavens,
Where one wishes to go, one arrives.
Cultivating truth brings wondrous proof,
Life abides, effects appear.
Old karma fades away,
New transgressions must not be made.
Truly revering the supreme Dao,
One inverts the world’s ways.
Returning like Yuanming,
First roaming Peng Isle.
Having slipped free, turning back,
The immortal realm knows no vexation.
Sages of past and present,
All penetrated the Three Teachings.

**II.**
Since time without beginning,
Countless ancestors have sunk in death.
As the Celestial Origin nears its end,
The *Yellow Register* saves from suffering.
Of thousands, one or two
Truly resolve to awaken.
With mind free of hatred or love,
The lofty immortals approve.
A human life spans a hundred years,
Yet only seeks the path of life.
Karma piles like mountains,
Hard to escape the nether courts.
The ten evils weigh heavily,
Condemning one to eternal suffering.
Yang deeds and yin practices—
How should one act?
Let all beings revere and believe,
Without harboring other concerns.
Worldly wealth is trifling,
Truth is the only speech.
To move heaven and earth,
One must dine purely and simply.
When approaching the altar for days,
Moving or staying in practice,
Unseen officials and spirits
Observe you day and night.
If found free of selfishness,
The Five Masters come to deliver you.
They memorialize the Celestial Sovereign,
Spreading vast blessings.
To behold the Three Luminaries again—
Such an opportunity after death is rare.

**III.**
A hundred thousand blessings aid,
A name transmitted through ten thousand ages.
The whole household, the entire family,
With minds like Pang and Xu.
Virtue and filial piety both perfected,
One becomes noble and prosperous.
Cultivating nature and life in advance,
Forever free from illness and suffering.
Departing the cycle of birth and death,
Neither coming nor going.
In the Great Luo’s immortal realm,
Attaining the Dao, one abides eternally.
Heavenly light and rosy clouds
Transform into a jeweled abode.
The six-zhu robe draped,
One ascends by different paths to the origin.
In the gardens of Lang and Peng,
The true immortals gather.
Once the Celestial Origin has passed,
The Dao’s karmic conditions are hard to meet.
The Three Teachings are undivided,
The gate of Quanzhen.
Nonaction responding to action,
Guiding people to awakening.
Pure and peaceful merit and conduct—
Truth is not to be grasped or discarded.
Beyond yin and yang,
The Primordial Ancestor.

**IV.**
When the appointed time arrives,
One must pay homage in reverence.

**IV. (continued)**

The heart’s exchange remains ever serene,
The mind’s imaginings free from strangeness.
In an instant, at the eastern gate,
We parted for two years.
Mountains and rivers unchanged,
Yet many people are no longer here.
Life is like dewdrops on a pearl—
How can it not decay?
Born in the Central Land,
Once one’s allotted span is spent, it cannot be regained.
An inch of the spirit’s Dao-treasure
Is worth ten thousand gold, yet priceless.
Unfulfilled greed and contention
All stem from love and attachment.
The four pursuits of fame and profit—
Everyone understands them.
Yet to comprehend virtue and the Dao,
Is to truly penetrate the Dharma-sea.
Auspicious mist and propitious qi
Weave into a canopy of clouds.
Strolling at ease on Pine Peak,
The spirit soars beyond the clouds.
Worldly falsity knows emptiness,
But birth and death are weighty matters.
In the secluded grotto-heavens,
Unfettered, one finds joy.
Revolving the harmonious qi,
Yin and yang unite in peace.
Having grasped the subtle and formless,
One truly ascends to the Yang realm.
Following the examples of Xu and Pang,
Free from debt or harm.

**V.**
A hundred years of human life—
Seventy is rare.
Worldly falsity knows emptiness,
Yet when will it ever end?
The Great Dao is natural,
Serene equanimity is supreme.
All things without flaw—
Better than performing grand rites.
The dream of past and present ages,
Suddenly awakens to true clarity.
Seeing through floating life,
All returns to a single smile.
Beyond the concerns of life and destiny,
One’s former attachments fade.

**VI.**
To serve as an official with integrity
Is truly free from guilt or illness.
Above, there are the Four Graces—
Accumulate merit and revere all.
Loyalty and filial piety govern the people,
Calm the mind and nurture nature.
Let the will not wander outward,
And the spirit will naturally settle.
Conceal evil and extol goodness—
Do not listen to idle words.
Abandon hatred and attachment,
Ever practicing impartiality.
Unattached to worldly splendor,
Wander idly along pine paths.
Green waters and blue mountains—
Grotto-heavens and immortal realms.
The original face,
Polished like a mirror.
Illuminating present and past,
Guard the Dao and reflect within.
When merit and conduct are complete,
One ascends to the Great Luo to pay homage.

**VII.**
Human life at seventy—
Rare in ancient and modern times.
Knowing the dream of the world is hollow,
All returns to a single smile.
In leisure, seek leisure—
To forget contrivance is to be done.
Ten thousand kinds of empty flowers,
In a turn of the head, vanish like illusion.
Truly honoring virtue and the Dao,
Gradually one penetrates the mysterious and wondrous.
Banish hatred and attachment—
Better than performing grand rites.
Within the body, life and destiny—
No small matter.
Like the sound of serene equanimity,
Even the Lord of Yin cannot summon it.

**VIII.**
From nonbeing, clarity arises,
Mysteriously penetrating divine incantations.
Jade-like nectar and ambrosia
Abide in the upper chambers.
When sober, one is pure and true—
Life extends, blessings and longevity follow.
The four lines of the Vajra,
In the sutras, offer compassionate deliverance.
The Dao of Heaven is hard to describe,
Formless yet imperishable.
Inverting yin and yang,
Mao ascends to meet You.
The subtle and formless are natural—
The Three Lights radiant and wondrous.
The immortal flowers of Lang Garden
Surpass the willows and blossoms of spring.
Revolving the Southern Asterism,
Wisdom gazes upon the Northern Dipper.
Greatly attaining nonaction,
One soars and roams at will.

**IX.**
Contemplating the true sutra in leisure
Surpasses empty words.
All things know emptiness—
Suddenly, there is no duality.
Revering the true without retreat,
One awakens as an immortal.
Pines and bamboo as neighbors,
Guard the Dao with a pure will.
From beginning to end, unwavering,
Heaven’s mechanism secretly bestows.
Wondrous enlightenment and true constancy—
All movement and stillness forgotten.
The primordial countenance,
Though visible, is hard to resemble.
Beyond yin and yang,
One departs the cycle of birth and death.

**X.**
Mother and child meet,
Naturally enlightened to the Dao.
With reverent faith and a true heart,
Take refuge in the Three Teachings.
Banish hatred and attachment,
Adapt to the profound and subtle.
Let the will dissolve greed and contention—
Free from guilt or affliction.
Life is like dewdrops on a pearl—
Cultivate the Dao early.
Recognizing the primordial spirit,
One never ages.
Suddenly perceiving a glimmer of light,
The cloud-path is reached.
Delighting in the Dao on Pine Peak,
Content with whatever comes.
Having conjoined mercury and lead,
Nurture the inner countenance.
When merit and conduct are both complete,
One truly ascends to Peng Isle.

**XI.**
A hundred strings of cash in the marketplace
Buy four trees.
Do not force others to seek,
Only aid in the work.
Unseen matters—
Few are real, many are false.
Willingly form affinities,
Reverence and faith are not lacking.
Among ten thousand, one may have
Surplus blessings and conduct.
At the immortal temples of Wu Palace,
The plaque reads "Spiritual Emptiness."
*(For the family of Cold-Seven Elder who left the household)*
When Cold-Seven Elder of the left-home life ascended,
His kin held a grand vegetarian feast and ritual,
Instructing the Daoists:
Do not demand payment for reciting scriptures.
If there is no money for recitation,
Only partake of the vegetarian meal.
The feathered robe is willingly offered—
The ritual is splendid to behold.
Profound virtue and great fortune
Conceal faults and earn praise.
For those who have not completed true cultivation,
How many demonic obstacles arise!
The sounds and sights before one’s eyes—
Principles reveal their illusory nature.
When mouth and heart align,
It is rare in the world.
Compassionately delivering sentient beings,
All transcend to the other shore.
The enlightened nature harmonious and serene,
Wood and metal converse.
Having refined the true form,
In a single surge, one ascends to the clouds.

**XII.**
While parents are alive,
How many truly understand?
People speak of long life,
Yet those who reach middle age are few.
From youth to old age,
There is awakening and delusion.
Fortune and misfortune—
Both follow one’s nature.
The body is like the waning moon,
Yet life remains whole.
Comprehending the Dao without delusion,
What doubt remains in true awakening?
When the spirit’s light shines forth,
One sees the ladder to the heavens.
Wisdom gazes upon the eight directions,
Letting go of east and west.
The Dao of Heaven is hard to describe,
Truly wondrous and subtle.
Having penetrated blessed conduct,
Even ghostly messengers cannot pursue.
The grotto-heaven is close at hand,
Lang Garden and Jasper Pool.
The natural treasure-sword
Ever guards against serpents and turtles.
Detached from all things,
One transcends the Three Realms.
Shedding the husk, truly departing,
Beyond emptiness, one returns to the clouds.

Fame’s reins and profit’s shackles—
A raging fire consuming the body.
Karmic debts and bonds of gratitude,
The threads of karma cannot be evaded.
Piled misfortunes like mountains,
How can the fruit of the Dao be attained?
Suddenly awakening to one’s nature and life,
What then of self and others?
Seeing the world as empty,
All things become acceptable.
Nearing sixty years,
Ten thousand illusions are shattered.
Though children and grandchildren may multiply,
None can replace this one.
When fortune comes, all vie for it;
In calamity and sickness, one lies alone.
From ancient times to now, birth and extinction—
Does the future hold understanding?
Even sages and worthies in the void,
How can they be deceived?
With no new transgressions committed,
The lords of the unseen may grant pardon.
The fading light of sunset—
Cease thoughts, let go of cares.
With sincere heart, revere and trust,
*Lisuo liluo.*
Through endless kalpas,
Better to sit in stillness.
Past errors and faults,
Bring only remorse and regret.
To constantly practice pure goodness
Surpasses the giving of wealth.

Again—
Four-sided Green City,
Like screens arrayed in formation.
Where Buddhas and immortals conceal themselves,
The eye’s horizon is vast and bright.
Not yet having attained the Dao,
One idly peruses the true scriptures.
Naturally, all wisdom arises,
Awakening to the unborn.
The supreme practice of non-action,
Without attachment or aversion.
Ever pure, ever serene,
Qi refines the spirit.
Those who awakened in ancient and modern times
Ascended thus.
Idle chatter of right and wrong,
Let it pass unheard.
From beginning to end, revere and trust,
Virtue and fortune both come to fruition.
Outwardly appearing foolish,
Yet inwardly ever wakeful.
In clarity and emptiness, forgetting the world,
The mind wearies of fleeting glory.

Again—
The苦 sea of sentient beings,
Adrift for ten thousand kalpas.
Bones traded like mountains,
Kindness turned to harm.
In this bustling world,
How many awaken and understand?
Though rocks crumble and pines wither,
The true spirit remains eternal.
The body like a floating bubble,
Unresolved karmic debts linger.
Suddenly perceiving the subtle and serene,
Truly forgetting desire and attachment.
Life’s radiance shines round,
The spirit ascends beyond the heavens.
The Great Dao is formless,
Unchanging from ancient times to now.
Though treasures amass beyond measure,
The wondrous mystery cannot be bought.
Stepping beyond yin and yang,
Utterly free from entanglements.
The two forces in harmonious union,
Naturally bringing peace and prosperity.
Nurturing the embryonic immortal,
Pure and clear beyond compare.
Forever freed from coming and going,
In true bliss and carefree wandering.
Hidden in the Water Curtain Grotto,
A thousand cascades of flying springs.
Delighting in the Dao on Pine Peak,
The true abode in the yang realm.
Neither birth nor aging,
Nor success nor failure.
Long ago, meeting Wang and Ma,
In the Central Land, they once paid homage.
In future years on Penglai Isle,
We shall meet again.

Again—
The Supreme Registers of Talismans,
Twenty-four ranks.

The Essential Wonders of the Daoist Canon,
The Sacred Altar ever open.
From the Primordial Heaven transmitted,
Transforming immortal talents.
True cultivation refines nature and life,
False nurturing merely sustains the body’s shell.
Lost, one sinks through the Six Paths;
Awakened, one departs without return.
Vacuous yet sagely,
Their compassion grieves for the world.
Purifying soul and spirit,
Embracing and guarding the immortal embryo.
Principles illuminate ten thousand wisdoms,
Attaining the profound purity of true fasting.
Moment by moment, subtly wondrous,
Revolving the Three Terraces.
Naturally without contrivance,
Serene and good, without discord.
The celestial heart’s true Dharma,
Neither covets wealth nor treasures.
Avoiding all transgressions,
It dissolves past calamities.
One sudden enlightenment unites all teachings,
The two qi cannot be buried.
The Three Treasures refined to perfection,
The Four Positions arranged in order.
Beyond the Five Phases,
The Six Exits resound with joy.
The seven emotions’ yin exhausted,
The Eight Trigrams shine to the farthest limits.
Ascending into the Nine Heavens,
The Ten Poles reach Penglai.
Moreover—
Attaining seventy years,
One more cycle remains.
Fulfilling heaven’s allotted span,
How few from ancient times to now?
Sudden cultivation of nature and life,
A matchless good deed.
Advancing, one becomes a true immortal;
Retreating, one descends as a ghost.
Greatly penetrating, clear, and unobstructed,
Beyond praise or blame.
Unassailed by profit or harm,
Truly free from sorrow or joy.
Leisurely observing the Three Teachings,
Subtly comprehending the utmost principle.
Escaping the sea of suffering,
The divine vessel arrives there.
Accumulating merit and deeds,
Ever more beautiful.
Moreover—
Gazing at present, looking to antiquity,
How many are willing to awaken?
Cease discussing leaving the household—
Consider Pang and Xu.
Born in the Central Land,
The Dao and virtue are rarely encountered.
Before parents,
Where lies the true origin?
Recognizing the subtle and tranquil,
Reversing the sun and moon.
Subtly attaining the natural,
Serene and ascending as an immortal.
To refine the great elixir,
Where is the best place to dwell?
The grotto-heavens are not far—
Leisurely departing with the clouds.
Eternally numinous, never aging,
The illusory body has its allotted span.
Life’s radiance shines round,
Without coming or going.
Moreover—
The utmost Dao is subtle and tranquil,
Who from ancient times to now has known it?
Beyond yin and yang,
Awakening to its wondrous subtlety.
The Dao transcends form and emptiness,
Non-action responding to action.
Pure and true, unchanging,
This is the ladder to the heavens.
Naturally inverting,
Revolving Kan to welcome Li.
Forgetting emotions to preserve life,
The bright moon suffers no loss.
White clouds come and go,
Trusting east or west.
To harmonize the Red Phoenix,
Truly embrace the Black Tortoise.
All falsities seen through,
Outwardly appearing foolish.
Only extolling others’ virtues,
Constantly examining one’s own faults.
Suddenly forgetting love and hate,
Mind without high or low.
Moreover—
The true immortal’s arts employ,
The numinous tortoise harmonizes the phoenix.
Grasping yin and yang,
The wondrous function of vacuity.
Amidst a myriad scenes,
Neither still nor moving.
Once dwelling in the capital,
Muddling through the world, forgetting dreams.
The Dao and virtue, subtle and tranquil,
Who from ancient times to now has upheld them?
A single spirit pearl,
Naturally played with.
All supervisors and overseers,
Presenting this humble ode.
The Daoist realm, serene and peaceful,
Fearing only disgrace or favor.
The descent of the Great Luo’s sages,
Fragrant winds bearing them.
Moreover—
Those near the altar rites, listen—
Abstain from meat, still the body.
Suffering oneself, without selfishness,
Gaining some merit and deeds.
If one violates heaven’s precepts,
Years of calamity, months of illness.
Responding to things, forgetting dust,
An inch of spirit like a mirror.
Officials and spirits silently observe,
Thought by thought, the heart upright.
Abandoning hate, exhausting love,
Clear, unobstructed, and equal.
To escape the wheel of rebirth,
Take refuge in the worthies and sages.
Moreover—
The vast sea humbles itself,
Myriad streams return clear.
The utmost Dao is formless,
Wondrously emerging from the finest hairs.
A welling spring of wisdom,
Grasping the meaning, forgetting knowledge.
Nurturing the true to preserve life,
Who from ancient times to now has relied on it?
Still and silent, unchanging,
This is the ladder to the heavens.
Muddling through the capital,
Alone delighting in the subtle and tranquil.
Naturally attaining principle,
Without awakening or delusion.
Suddenly comprehending the Three Teachings,
What further doubts remain?
The lotus root in the mud,
The lotus rising from the green mire.
Responding to transformations, forgetting words,
Non-action responding to action.
Cultivating true subtlety,
Outwardly appearing foolish.
Qi and spirit meet,
Conjoining Kan to welcome Li.
The world lacks those willing to awaken,
Thus hiding by clear streams.
The twelve divisions of the celestial cycle,
Leisurely drinking the elixir.
In years past, treading the clouds,
Once traversing the passes of the west.
Just like a child,
White hair hastens.
The immortal’s affairs unfinished,
The ghostly messengers are hard to evade.
Refining soul and spirit to perfection,
The precious mirror suffers no loss.
Beyond yin and yang,
The sun and moon ever follow.
Let the human world
Speak of right and wrong.
The grotto-heavens are not far,
Yet those who arrive are truly few.
All transgressions dissolved,
Forever freed from the wheel of rebirth.
Moreover—
Knowing the dust of the world departs,
Without contention, truly awakened.
Reciting the Dao, serene and peaceful,
Brushing away all sorrow and care.
Loving what is not loved,
The lofty immortals approve.
The awakened nature, bright and constant,
Not an inch of joy or anger.
Do not say it is wrong,
Leisurely discussing past and present.
Born in the Central Land,
Early seek the immortal’s path.
Forgetting emotions to preserve life,
Clearly penetrating mother and child.

**[For the Daoist Assembly]**

In the lower Yuan of the Xinyou year, Binzhou issued a register, appointing me as a master of ordination. I declined, yet offered this in response:

The sacred scriptures and talismanic registers—
the Most High alone is master.
Though five masters confer ordination,
the myriad things remain selfless.
Deeply treasuring the Three Jewels,
beginning and end are one moment.
From ancient times to now, immortals and sages,
each one truly compassionate.
The Dao transmits subtleties—
in the blink of an eye, brows raised.
Polishing the sword of wisdom,
the numinous subdues snake and tortoise.
Within and without, not a hair’s difference,
penetrating principle without doubt.
Ever praising others’ virtues,
only searching out one’s own faults.
Utterly dissolving the self’s form,
virtue returns to humility.
True equanimity in conduct,
embracing the One without parting.
In dwelling, walking, sitting—
revolving Kan to welcome Li.
Knowing the white, guarding the black,
not yielding even to encircling stones.
Naturally possessing ten thousand wisdoms,
yet those who are enlightened are truly few.
A single grain of numinous elixir
cures all sins and ailments.
Cultivating and perfecting nature and life,
even ghostly messengers cannot pursue.
Truly without joy or anger,
ascending the azure vault of heaven.
Recognizing the true countenance
surpasses worship of the Muni.
Refining the Seven Treasures,
one escapes the trade of the walking corpse.
Saving the living, delivering the dead,
leisurely delighting in the subtle and serene.
Heaven’s precepts must not be violated,
the laws of the land are to be obeyed.
Realizing the true Daoist visage,
like the moon, never waning.
Concealing radiance amid turbidity,
outwardly appearing simple and foolish.
In grotto-heavens, chanting verses,
poems and songs joyfully inscribed.
Before pines and beside rocks,
spirit drinks the medicinal spoon.
Why weary of the world?
There is no true refuge.
Do not obscure the square inch of the heart—
sages and worthies silently follow.
Abandoning evil, forgetting greed,
no further calamities or dangers arise.
Emerging from the Five Paths,
one escapes donning the skin.
On the road to the Court of Primordial Origin,
the body is draped in immortal robes.
Seas transform into mulberry fields,
yet the visage remains unchanged, undecaying.
Beyond yin and yang,
birth and extinction cannot hasten.
As merit and virtue accrue,
blessings surpass Mount Sumeru.
Receive transmission with reverence and faith—
delay not in setting to work.
When purity reaches its culmination,
merit may be high or low.
Ascending to heaven above,
below, one avoids the courts of darkness.
The world deluded by love and passion—
who severs the qi?
Like Pang and Xu,
forever freed from the wheel of rebirth.

Moreover—
True Persons and great masters,
one dare not treat lightly.
Long have I heard of their supreme virtue,
their pure renown without compare.
Vastly accumulating great felicity,
in years past, mingling with the world.
In blessed lands and grotto-heavens,
they too once wandered as clouds and waters.
Before the pines of Pan’s Stone,
they refined lead and tempered the self.
Inner work completed beforehand—
how many through the ages?
Suddenly awakened, taking refuge,
a single assembly on Penglai.

Moreover—
The world’s loves are ephemeral,
fragrant only for the season.
The immortals’ fair scenes
follow the four seasons in constancy.
The flower of awakening never fades,
hidden at the center.
Heavenly fragrance descends,
naturally wafting rare perfumes.
With eyes of wisdom, one sees—
it is another Chongyang.
Penglai and Langyuan,
their true light never fades.
The cloud pavilion’s immortal music
does not yield to grand halls.
Riding the wind, one departs,
arriving in the immortal realm.
Each perfects merit and conduct—
take your time, do not rush.

Moreover—
Arriving in Xuan at the prefecture,
do not act so hastily.
Each must recite the Dao,
from beginning to end, ever well.
At monthly assemblies,
do not make requests.
If three invitations go unanswered,
do not grow remorseful.
Should anger arise instead,
one will face old Yan at death.
Without transgression, joy abounds—
better than suffering from greed.
As the Heavenly Origin nears its end,
the true teaching is hard to encounter.
If you heed my words,
you will truly wander Peng Island.

Moreover—
In the Jiachen year, ascending the prefecture,
the Yellow Register was revived.
In Changyang, omens appeared—
by day, a bright star was seen.
The Patriarch manifested beforehand,
in the lower Yuan at Wendeng.
A white tortoise on a lotus pedestal—
the true marvel was clear.
Inscribed at Zisheng Abbey,
ascending and transforming in Nanjing.
Four companions guarded the tomb,
once near the Upper Clarity.
Dwelling together for five years,
wandering as clouds and waters.
As the Heavenly Origin nears its end,
true tranquility is not yet attained.
Mercury and lead refined,
another true form emerges.

Respectfully offering to the assembly of the Three Teachings’ Daoist followers and expressing my sentiments—

Myriad scriptures suddenly awakened,
the work of purity and stillness.
To truly accomplish the Dao,
from beginning to end, unwavering.
The square inch of spirit luminous,
outwardly appearing foolish.
Cool in summer, warm in winter,
leisurely perusing immortal texts.
Beside pines and bamboos, by rocks,
dwelling in carefree purity.
No transgressions committed,
old karma dissolved.
Refining the Three Jewels,
shedding the mortal frame.
Escaping the wheel of rebirth,
ascending into the Void.
Paying homage at the Great Lofty Court,
eternally abiding in the Heavenly Capital.

Moreover—
Self-reflecting, I am unworthy,
yet widely bestowing the Dao’s sustenance.

I have no meritorious deeds or virtuous conduct—
I urge you to consider deeply.
Curb greed, forget desire,
to augment fortune and secure well-being.
Expand your fields and silkworm farms,
awaken to the seal and reduce loss.
Constantly refined and tempered,
each day faces impermanence.
Without cultivating nature and life,
gold and treasures amass in vain.
As evil karma departs,
wealth and sons remain behind.
With a sudden awakening of the true heart,
follow the example of Dan Yang.
Rescuing the living, delivering the dead,
virtue pervades the ten directions.
Weary of dwelling in the human world,
ascend into the immortal realm.

Moreover—
Descendants may flourish in rows,
yet the great limit cannot be evaded.
From ancient times to the present in this world,
how few have awakened?
Adrift in the bitter sea,
none transcend its depths.
Among ten thousand, not one remains unscathed;
even the rarest may yet be ruined.
Hearts defying morality and the Dao,
contend only for fame and profit.
Failing to cultivate nature and life,
how can one avoid becoming a ghost below?
When greed and wrath are wholly dispelled,
the immortal’s livelihood is attained.
Though the great limit draws near,
still they cling to the world.

Moreover—
In renowned mountains and academies,
quietly hang zither and sword.
Myriad sacred scriptures,
joyfully perused in leisure.
Naturally comprehending principle,
fully realizing true efficacy.
Amid pine peaks and rosy grottoes,
the world’s falsity is shunned.
Reclining on Pan’s stone,
eternally dwelling in purity.
If the mind fixates on fame and profit,
the perilous summit is hard to scale.
Since ancient times, the resolute,
have ground away but a single speck—
releasing the luminous pearl,
radiating its brilliance.
Burning to perceive the eternal countenance,
the Dao unfolds in sudden and gradual ways.
The eight trigrams faintly grasped,
form and emptiness remain unstained.
Extolling others’ virtues,
concealing their flaws.
Merit and conduct perfected,
thoughts and cares forgotten.

Moreover—
Unable to depart yet,
like Pang and Xu,
the whole family attained the Dao,
their names transmitted through the ages.
Desires for greed and contention extinguished,
recognizing the crow and hare.
The natural Dao,
inverts the cycles of Zi and Wu.
Comprehending principle and illuminating truth,
one knows the ancestral origin.
Suddenly awakening to the true and constant,
there is neither grasping nor relinquishing.
In true joy and purity,
the Jade Emperor elevates one to immortality.
Emerging from birth and extinction,
abiding in the Great Lofty Heaven.
Though merit and conduct remain imperfect,
the will stands firm in simplicity.
Unchanging from beginning to end,
sages and worthies come to deliver.
The lofty perfected of the Three Teachings,
are your true masters.

Moreover—
Universally exhorting all,
first practice filial piety.
At ease in the bamboo pavilion,
leisurely peruse the *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*.
From ancient times to the present in this world,
how few have fathomed their mysteries?
Awakening to the subtle and imperceptible,
recognizing the eternal countenance.
On Penglai’s cloud paths,
one must walk the Dao to arrive.
Without committing myriad transgressions,
not an inch of suffering remains.
Harmonizing with the heart of Heaven,
uttering wondrous teachings.
Not discussing others’ faults,
the lofty perfected approve.
Impermanence is unfathomable—
cultivate truth early.
Attaining the Dao and becoming immortal,
one avoids facing King Yama.

Moreover—
Since parting from your noble county,
thirteen years have passed.
This illusory body decays with age,
yet true immortality remains unattained.
Deeds fall short of eight hundred,
while transgressions number three thousand.
The Three Teachings converge as one—
no debate between Dao and Chan.
Seeing nature, one becomes Buddha;
refining mercury to merge with lead.
The heavenly Dao is wordless,
the sagely Dao is secretly transmitted.
Superior practitioners ascend in flight,
the middling and lesser prolong their lives.
Born in the Central Kingdom,
it is rare to encounter the celestial origin.

Moreover—
In years past, I traveled,
once visiting Songyang.
Bodhidharma faced the wall,
nine years in true oblivion.
Discoursing on the vastness that encompasses Heaven,
subtly surpassing the finest hair.
Beyond yin and yang,
transcending impermanence.
Amid pine peaks and rosy grottoes,
dwelling surpasses lofty halls.
Within the gourd’s heaven, sun and moon,
day and night stretch long.
In purity and wondrous practice,
merit and conduct attain perfection.
Emerging from the fiery pit,
one encounters a different warmth and chill.

Moreover—
In ordinary dealings,
balance devotion to the Dao with fairness.
When transactions arise,
refrain from contention.
Conduct measured by rule and scale,
merit recognized by weight and star.
Truly understanding good deeds,
speak as if reciting scripture.
Harmony and filial piety,
surpass mere human sentiment.
Speaking of others’ flaws,
best not to listen.
The heart reveres supreme virtue,
while outwardly responding to empty fame.
Truly born of reverence and faith,
preserving life and penetrating the numinous.
Embracing the Dao’s constancy,
one avoids falling into the netherworld.
In years to come, departing,
roaming Penglai’s isles.

Moreover—
From dawn to dusk, pay homage,
constantly burning incense of renown.

Pure peace and blessed virtue surpass all immortal formulas.
Refrain from harming living spirits—
the whole household finds peace and well-being.
Awakened to the Dao, the mind is at ease;
deluded by the world, the heart is restless.
Without creating hidden transgressions,
one beholds heaven’s halls.
Pine and bamboo as companions,
through the four seasons’ warmth and chill.
Jade terraces and Penglai’s gardens—
when the time comes to depart, do not forget.
Truly free from entanglements,
one arrives at the immortal realm.

Moreover—
Without ability or virtue,
profound offerings are hard to accept.
From afar, they come to greet,
again presenting jade-like nectar.
Honored officials of two clans,
both revering the Double Yang.
When merit is complete and fame achieved,
they yearn for the immortal realm.
All worldly affairs,
suddenly seem entirely forgotten.
The Dao-nature truly awakened,
in the mercury storehouse and lead chamber.
Upon Penglai’s clouded paths,
lies a different cool serenity.

Moreover—
The Way of Heaven is hard to describe;
life abides where light is transmitted.
Cease the arising of desire,
and refine mercury and lead.
Transcend self and other,
embracing the Dao to commune with immortals.
Walking the full eight hundred,
fulfilling the three thousand merits.
Beyond Spirit Peak Cave,
leisurely facing forests and springs.
Ever dining on plain simplicity,
the mind distant from flesh and fish.
Zither and books as companions,
reclining high amidst clouds and mist.
In years to come, departing,
alone stepping toward the primordial dawn.

Moreover—

The Rite of Illuminating the True holds matters most pressing.
To deliver and uplift ancestral spirits—each vow must be fulfilled.
Ask not of the silver spent, nor the sum required.
Account with impartiality, keeping two ledgers of receipt and disbursement.
As the rite approaches, all participants must guard desire as paramount.
Keep far from the rank and foul, lest life be cut short or prolonged at whim.
The spirits and officials observe in secret—reward and retribution are no trifling matter.

When drawing near the rite to greet the True,
let no clamor or outcry arise.
The High Merit’s Daoist arts
shall manifest and propagate the Great Teaching.
The talismans and petitions inscribed—
let all officers clearly understand.
The texts for deliverance require no separate provisions.
A hundred days of effort must not lapse into false pretense.
After the full moon of late winter,
radiance must be made manifest.
Divide not day from night,
and cut away all worldly affairs.

[Farewell to Ma Gu]
Ma Gu has dwelt near Donglai Prefecture for nearly two years,
and in every household that reveres the Dao, she has been held in esteem and affection.
Yet now she must depart for the capital,
for some small matters remain unfinished.
After the Mid-Autumn dawn, she will take her leave,
jotting these few words in haste, knowing they fall short:

The Great Dao is non-action, yet the True responds with action.
Formless yet manifest, blessings arise from deeds performed.
By not committing myriad transgressions,
one suddenly awakens to true conduct.
By not coveting the ten thousand things,
one attains purity beyond the world.
By not giving rise to myriad evils,
one transforms through goodness.
By not stirring myriad hatreds,
one transforms through virtue.
As the Dao unfolds the myriad principles,
one transforms through wisdom.
As the world illuminates the myriad truths,
one transforms through scripture.
The four lines of the *Vajra*,
transform through Chan.
The *Zhouyi*’s creative transformations,
transform through hexagrams.
The *Daodejing*’s five thousand characters,
transform through cultivation.
The ten directions and three realms—
the Three Teachings spread widely.
Though the myriad methods are undivided,
the world reveres them as one.

To repay the Four Graces,
there is nothing the non-action does not accomplish.

Moreover—
Without cultivation, there is cultivation;
without action, there is responsive action.
Without attachment, without detachment,
without greatness, without minuteness.
Without hatred, without love,
without right, without wrong.
Without increase, without decrease,
without high, without low.
Without taking, without seizing,
without sorrow, without delusion.
Within non-being, one responds to things,
without thought, without cunning.
Naturally inverted,
speaking east yet awakening west.
Seeing joy, one grows angry;
promising insight, one remains deluded.
The Dao has no form,
no thought, no knowledge.
Eternally unchanging,
without falsehood, without doubt.
Without coming, without going—
the ladder to the clouds and heavens.
Without movement, without effort,
revolving Kan to welcome Li.
Without emotion, yet ever-present in form,
Infant and Maiden follow in tandem.
The image of no-thing—
rarely understood from ancient times to now.
The lotus root lies in water,
yet the lotus blossom rises from the mud.
Having transcended the far shore,

Completion attained, one departs to ascend—the true realm of Supreme Clarity.

Moreover—
The body like a circular wall—light emanating from all sides.

Moreover—
The world’s deceit is not enduring—

*Xianle Ji*, Scroll Three Concludes
*Xianle Ji*, Scroll Four Begins

**Divine Mountain’s Effortless Response to Conditions**
*Composed by Perpetual Youth Liu Chuxuan*

**Verse Presented to the Prefectural Envoy, Officials, and Fellow Daoists**

Things and affairs—heart at rest, the Dao-eye opens,
The fetal immortal nurtured, floating jade cups.
Naturally awakened beyond yin and yang,
Riding the crane in true ascent—never to return.

**Jiangshenzi**

The Dao-heart differs from the worldly heart.
Awakened to emptiness, things and dust are contained.
Comprehending principle, illuminating truth,
Adapting naturally to change.
Love and hate, right and wrong—all unstained,
Roaming blessed lands,
Keeping company with pine-clad peaks.

The crane-body refined, soaring in azure skies,
Free to roam east or west, visiting Penglai’s palaces.
Transcending yin and yang,
Immortal life knows no end.
Seas may turn to dust, pines wither—yet the true never decays,
Rising beyond the Three Realms,
Following the immortal elders.

Today, the jade forest’s blossoms bloom in full,
With utmost true joy, three cups are drunk.
Carefree and tipsy—where to go?
To Penglai’s immortal realm, departing and returning.

**Four Poems in *Shangpingxi***

To think of a hundred years—like a single dream,
How fleeting the time.
The wondrous and subtle—merely this much.
If all would believe,
In daily matters, the myriad things bear no selfish intent.
In dwelling, walking, sitting, lying—true equality,
Adapting with true compassion.

Honor the Dao of immortals, clarify immortal principles,
Master immortal wonders, give thanks to immortal masters.
On Spirit Peak, idly gathering magic mushrooms,
In hidden grotto-heavens, the twelve celestial stems welcome *li*.
When the three fields’ work is complete, one ascends to the origin,
Shedding the walking corpse.

Again—

Arriving at the immortal garden,
Pines and bamboos emerald, peonies crimson.
In joyful purity—how many share this?
Forgetting the world’s dream,
All turns to emptiness in an instant.
Moon’s waxing and waning—like sorrow and joy,
Awakening to love’s weary heart.

True leisure is good, attaining leisure’s delight,
Mastering leisure’s wonders, perceiving leisure’s flow.
Moving the hexagrams, recognizing the ancestral luminous source.
Xu You and Pang Zu,
Already ascended to azure skies.
If all would follow this and honor the true Dao,
They would meet on Penglai’s isle.

Again—

Clinging to kindness and kinship,
Kindness breeds harm—death cannot be escaped.

When qi fails to come, the body lies in the wilds.
Changing heads and faces, how many thousands of times
Has the wheel of rebirth traded these bones?
Worldly splendor is no firmer than a spark,
A prison of fire and captivity.

Yet let one roam as cloud and water,
Ascend the cloud-path,
Wander beyond the clouds, play upon cloud-waves.
Spurning brocade robes, delight in donning hempen rags.
In pure peace and virtue,
Complete the cultivation of nature and life,
Dwelling hidden in thatched huts.
One day, shedding the shell to ascend before the sages,
One’s name is enrolled among the immortals’ ranks.

Again—

Reflect on human life:
Old and young, like spring and autumn.
Just in youth—suddenly turns to white-haired age.
Do not contend over emptiness and illusion,
For when the qi of impermanence severs, one lies in the wilds.
In all, thirty-six thousand days,
Mostly sick, mostly sorrowful.

Honor the true Dao,
Revere the true sages,
Illumine true principle,
Fulfill true cultivation.
Serve the two venerables, perfect filial piety in full.
The whole household is delivered,
Achieving merit, together they depart for Yingzhou.
Emerging from the cycle of birth and death, without coming or going,
They wander the pure gardens of Langyuan.

Eight *Man Ting Fang*

Thirty years between,
How many times favored, how many times humbled?
Reflecting on past affairs, weary of speech.
Once I let my hair grow long,
Once I received the emperor’s summons.
Today, I dwell in a mountain village,
Yet someday I shall depart, high-reclining amidst clouds and mist.
Hidden in the grotto-heaven,
Beside the pine peaks,
Preserving life is the cultivation of immortality.

Without transgression,
Perfecting virtue,
Naturally attaining principle,
Refining mercury, cooking lead.
Before merit is complete and conduct perfected,
Leisurely facing the woods and springs.
True joy—zither and books for companions,
Forgetting the dusty world, escaping its torments.
How carefree!
Shedding the form to truly depart,
Ascending into the Great Luo Heaven.

Again—

Encountering the Sevenfold Purification Fast,
On Gengshen days, eating plainly,
Paying homage at dawn and dusk, burning incense.
Constantly mindful of the Dao,
The world’s dream is suddenly forgotten.
The Three Teachings’ scriptures as companions,
In true leisure—better than greedy busyness.
Deluded clouds disperse,
A single wheel of bright moon,
Flawless, illuminating all directions.

In perpetuity,
Illumine the great Dao,
Secretly accumulate deeds,
Ascending to reach the vault of heaven.
Emulating Xu and Pang, departing,
Their names resound through ten thousand ages.
Not yet gone to Penglai or Langyuan,
In a bamboo pavilion, seated,
Laughing and reciting in seclusion.
When merit is complete and one departs,
Even the lords of the underworld cannot summon them,
Riding a crane to the immortal realm.

Again—

This life’s glory,
The merit of past lives,
Awakening to better true cultivation.
Outer joys not yet exhausted,
Thoughts stir, the mind fills with sorrow.
The joy of the plain and ordinary Dao,
In a bamboo pavilion, seated,
Diligently seeking the supreme principle.
Truly enlightened,
The azure sky gleams pure,
Life shines like new autumn.

Enough!
Honor virtue,
Govern with purity and integrity,
Responding to change with perfect completeness.
Awaiting merit’s completion and fame’s fulfillment,
Wandering amidst rosy clouds.
Zither, sword, and immortal scriptures as companions,
Shedding the form to truly ascend,
Rising above the clouds.
Like Pang and Xu,
The whole household is delivered,
Dwelling forever in Yingzhou.

Xu the True Lord’s entire household ascended to heaven,
Pang the Layman’s entire household sat in liberation and departed.

Again—

Three years of effort,
Eight or nine parts out of ten complete,
Some yet unfinished, merit not yet perfected.

Without ever filing petitions,
The blessings come as natural coin.
No need to perform rites or mobilize the crowd—
A grain of hemp or wheat suffices,
Nourishing the numinous fields.
Not sought from without,
Creation arises from the void,
Its wondrous subtlety ineffable.

The Dao transmitted—
Illuminating the *Yi*’s images,
Reversing the radiance’s course,
Before heaven and earth.
Awakening: formless yet responding to things,
Beyond the chatter of center or edge.
Pure and still, golden infant and jade maiden,
Within the void, mercury congeals with numinous lead.
Six *zhu* draped,
Returning to the Great Veil,
Once more receiving the Jade Emperor’s decree.

Again—

Body clad in cloud-robes,
Form like plain cloth,
One must not disdain pure poverty.
The Dao has no form or image,
Great awakening reveals the truth within.
Hatred and love—no virtue in either,
All praise and submission are good causes.
Vast fortune arrives,
Leisurely observing the Dharma-teachings,
Pines and bamboo ever as neighbors.

True kin—
Preserving life and nature,
Illuminating past and present,
Merging with the world, dust forgotten.
If one follows my constant goodness,
Eternal escape from sinking and drowning.
The Peng Isle’s immortal realm lies close,
Shedding form to reveal the true spirit.
Beyond the azure skies,
In the Great Veil’s heavens,
The flawless treasure-light renewed.

Again—

Myriad evils—heart extinguished,
A thousand thoughts—mind dissolved,
Naturally, sins and afflictions vanish.
A thread of spirit clings to the Dao,
Movement and stillness both forgotten.
Pure will like Pang’s or Xu’s,
Wandering clouds and waters—everywhere home.
The immortals’ joy:
A thatched hut in quiet seclusion,
Far surpassing grand halls.

No haste.
Contemplate the ancient teachings,
Suddenly grasp the supreme truth,
Ascend to the Three Luminaries.
No need for day or night,
Counting lines of ink in search.
Nurtured true lead, true mercury,
Shedding form—beyond heaven and earth’s measure.
Beyond azure skies,
Returning to the Great Veil,
Once more bowing to Ma Danyang.

*Divine Light Radiant (Shengsheng Man)* Three Poems

Chu Xuan bows deeply,
To the esteemed Libationer,
Three years since our parting.
Longing and reverence—paths too distant,
No messenger could suffice.
In the heat of early autumn, Xin-You,
A visitor sent, then swiftly departed.
I inquired of your state—
Learned of your flourishing duties,
Soon to be promoted.

One day, world-weary with merit fulfilled,
You’ll follow Yuanming’s joy in the Dao,
Companion to forests and springs.
Unfettered, laughing and chanting,
Before the pines beyond the cave.
Nurtured true lead, true mercury,
When the time comes—three thousand merits complete.
Ascend to the Origin,
Revealing your true form, strolling the cloud pavilion alone.

---

Chu Xuan bows again,
To the High Merit of the Dao Register,
Since our parting under the sun, rare to meet.
Longing and reverence—when shall I
Behold the immortal’s countenance?
In the mid-winter of Xin-You,
I hastily lit incense, knelt to receive your opened letter.
Virtue of the Clear River,
Your karmic threads unfold in rites,
Devotion boundless.

Light pervades the ten directions—truly perfected,
Departing to the Great Veil, paying homage to the Sage,
Ascending into the high vault.
Body draped in cloud-robes for ten thousand miles,
Intent on riding the wind.
This time, liberated from birth and death,
Free to come and go—straddling tigers, riding dragons.
Beyond heaven and earth,
How many through the ages have truly walked this path?

---

Chu Xuan bows deeply,
To the Moon-Veiled Lords Zhang and Tang,
Since our parting, my thoughts linger.
Suddenly, over a year has passed—
I hear you now dwell in Tianchang.
I recall the serene seat of the Dharma-teacher,
Speaking of rites in Guanzhong, at Qiyang.
Incense and flowers led the way,
Where Lord Hao, perceiving the Dao,
Greatly laughed at Chongyang.

Then I, Chu Xuan, recklessly spoke,
Pouring a verse to the River Moon,
A single thought unforgotten.
Worn iron sandals in vain search,
In the dim radiance of the spirit.
Naturally, the wondrous exists within nothingness,
The Dao’s mystery—emptiness enfolding all things.
With merit complete, depart,
Ascend to the Great Veil’s heavens,
Awarded the celestial jade chime.

---

*Pouring the River Moon (Nian Nu Jiao)* Five Poems

From ancient times to now, trading bones,
Contemplating life, death, rise, and fall—
How many?
A hundred years of light, four seasons pressing,
Unnoticed, the form ages.
Worldly falsity, fleeting glory,
A turn of the head like a dream,
All ends in vanity.
One thought of non-birth,
Clinging to the Dao—truly enlightened.

Best to dwell in blessed lands,
By mountains, beside waters,
Freely wandering with staff in hand.
Securing true joy, hidden in rosy caves,
Leisurely perusing the sacred teachings.
Merits and deeds complete,
Life and nature perfected,
Surpassing repeated rites.
Refining the Dao-body,
A golden edict arrives from on high.

---

My cares from Longxi,
To Weiyang’s Qin Terrace,
Coming and going in vain.
The esteemed Prefect and Magistrate,
Visiting before departure, urging me.
In the new year of Ren-Xu,
They wished to invite me to the prefecture,
Yet the Master did not consent.
Chu Xuan replied,
Here, too, the Lantern Festival is celebrated.

Who awakens to the Three Origins in the four seasons?
Heavenly officials bestow blessings,
Descending to relieve the suffering of yin spirits.
Born in the Central Land, revering virtue,
The world praises, names echo through the ages.
Grand rites of vast fortune,
Blue petitions presented to the Sage,
Responses rarely met.
Wenshan’s rites,
White turtle, lotus—supporting Ancestor Wang.

---

Living past Pengzu,
Holding rank above the first grade,
As rich as Shi Chong.
From ancient times to now, worldly affairs—
Realizing their weightlessness.
Retiring like Yuanming,
Sailing like Fan Li,
Already transcended.
Truly mastering the Dao,
Escaping the dark paths of death.

Cloud-steps to Penglai, Langyuan,
Immortal lands never night,
Each has its carefree abode.
Beyond the Celestial Origin’s supreme Dao,
A thousand years—hard to encounter.
The spark of life’s light,
Foam’s birth and death,
Flying crows following the hare.
Swiftly cultivate life and nature,
Wise sages secretly guide you.

---

Sitting in the azure pavilion’s quiet,
Suddenly forgetting words,
Leisurely perusing a thousand scrolls of poetry and books.
Pine path, staff in hand, truly clinging to the Dao,
Profound, the celestial mechanism’s depth.
Beyond the world, within the mortal realm,
Capital’s clouds, cave’s radiance,
When the wisdom-eye opens—seen.
Existence and non-existence both dissolved,
Laughing and chanting, floating life unjudged.

The households of Pang and Xu ascend,
Returning to the Great Veil,
Escaping the trade of bones, life and death.
Immortal lands never night—no suffering,
Langyuan’s jade pools, pure feasts.
Seas turn to withered pines,
Eternal youth—no aging,
Worldly falsity—no envy.
Six-spun robes draped,
Again ascending to the Origin, revealed anew.

---

Weary of dwelling in the mortal world,
Like a lone cloud drifting,
A crane soaring to the heavens.
Unfettered, unbound, beyond the void,
Letting go—directly transcending the other shore.
Everywhere home,
Zither and books as companions,
Freely writing, chanting sighs.
Reclining in the grotto-heaven,
Let others mock my laziness.

Summer nears—hundred-foot pines tower,
Water curtains roar,
Flying into the Dragon Spring Gorge.
Thirst quenched with rosy nectar at immortal gatherings,
Youths singing, lips and tongues loose.
Escaping the wheel of rebirth,
Life and nature perfected,
The deluded struggle to follow.
Forsaking fame, renouncing profit,
Let others praise or blame at will.

---

*Water Dragon Chant*

This early winter of Xin-You,
On the full moon of the Lower Origin,
Sweet rain arrives.
Wheat sprouts flourish,
Roots deep, stems firm,
More joy, fewer cares.
Clinging to the Dao—no disasters,
Sages protect—no suffering for beings.
The Celestial Origin nears its end,
Immortals celebrate in assembly,
Merits complete—
Ascend to the Origin.

Beyond lies the celestial palace’s treasure,
Perfected true cultivation—
Ascending the cloud path.
Six-spun robes draped,
Pure peace, blessings bestowed,
Nine ancestors, seven generations.
Returning—no aging or death,
Naturally, life and nature—
Illuminating past and present.

**Households Devoted to the Dao**

Let every household uphold the Dao from beginning to end,
Unchanging as the steadfast Peng and Xu.

*Flowers Along the Path*
Frost-kissed forests scatter crimson leaves,
Golden wheat surges across the land.
Wild geese depart the northern frontier,
Their cries echoing in flight.
Like Yuanming, I return home,
Sipping wine in joyful solitude.
Drunk on true delight, I laugh aloud,
Reclining high in cloud-wrapped mountains,
Forgetting the dusty world—
Falsehoods cannot touch me.
Suddenly awakened,
I respond to things with no mind.
The Dao’s mystery runs deep by nature.
Within the gourd, immortal scenes differ—
Seek no more without.
Flowers bloom in all four seasons,
Discussing the past to illumine the present.
One day, riding the wind, I shall depart
To the Three Isles and Ten Continents,
Where Penglai’s peaks rise anew.

*Two Lyrics to "Fragrant Journey"*

I have wandered the human realm,
Yet now I envy the sacred mountains.
In cave-heavens so pure, I sit and listen
To the murmuring streams.
Ten thousand pines and cypresses,
A thousand acres of mist and clouds—
Fine companions for my zither and books.
Truly devoted to the Dao,
I delight in tranquility.

Having refined the numinous lead,
My life’s radiance shines round.
When merit is complete,
I shall become an immortal of Penglai Isle,
Transcending birth and death,
Eternally remembered.
Freed from the wheel of rebirth,
Robed in six-spun silk,
I ascend to the Origin.

Again—
The golden tripod glows,
Ever burning true incense.
Precious vases bloom with flowers
Fragrant through all four seasons.
Saints and sages of the void
Dwell as near as the western paradise.
I revere the Three Pure Ones,
Illumine the Three Luminaries,
And awaken to the Three Sovereigns.

In ancient times, people were simple,
Honest and blessed with good fortune.
Their nature connected to heaven,
Unobstructed by the Dao.
They practiced equality in secret,
Softness overcoming hardness.
Their minds like those of immortals,
Their conduct wholly immortal—
They journeyed to the immortal realm.

*Willow by the Mountain Pavilion*

Those who retreat from the Dao fall,
Those who advance in the Dao rise.
Retreating is folly—
The mind wanders, the heart stirs,
Life is lost to endless greed.
Unafraid of divine scrutiny,
A thousand faults, ten thousand errors
Bewilder the living.
In death, they plunge into Fengdu’s torments,
Suffering without end, reborn among beasts.

Those who advance in the Dao,
Pure and true, forget the world’s illusions,
Leisurely studying sacred teachings like scholars.
Comprehending principles, they awaken to cultivation.
Qi congeals, the spirit becomes wondrous,
Naturally, rosy clouds and radiant light arise.
The precious mirror gleams in the azure sky—
Truly, they become immortals.

*Six Lyrics to "Crossing the Mountain Brook"*

Nearly seventy years old,
The time is ripe to forget the dusty world.
How long will this dream of life last?
Cultivating virtue surpasses
Striving for meager gains.
Mountains of kindness, seas of love—
The fiery household burns the body.
Hearing of health, I seek coolness,
Letting deluded people slander as they will.

Leisurely observing the Three Teachings,
I understand the transformations of the *Zhouyi*.
Comprehending principles, I connect with heaven’s mysteries,
The four forms dissolved—
No sorrow, no joy.
In cave-heavens, I recline at ease,
Refining the true elixir.
One day, I shall ascend the azure sky,
Revealing the marvels of non-action.

Again—
The splendor of the human world
Is like a candle in the wind.
All things turn to emptiness in the end—
Beyond the world, recluses enjoy
The pure blessings of immortals.
In misty peaks and grottoes,
Unaware of autumn through the four seasons,
Pines as companions, bamboo as neighbors,
I idly sing the song of no-birth.

Zither and books bring joy to my nature,
The Dao’s function harmonizes metal and wood.
Refining a body for the nine heavens,
Robed in six-spun silk,
I swiftly ascend to the Origin.
Forever free from aging and death,
I rise into the Great Brahma Heaven,
As the vast sea turns to mulberry fields—
Truly, I follow the divine immortals.

Again—
All worldly affairs,
Seen through, bring only laughter.
Love and worldly attachments,
Like impermanence itself,
Are all exhausted in time.
This floating bubble of a body—
When will its birth and death cease?
Forgetting the world’s illusions,
Abandoning greed and strife,
I depart from the Dao, truly enlightened.

Subtle light awakens and illumines,
Responding with profound subtlety.
Life abides, nature connects to heaven,
Naturally bestowing boundless radiance.
Yang pure, yin exhausted,
I shed my shell, freed from sinking.
Roaming the Jasper Pool,
Playing in the Jade Pond,
The Jade Emperor’s golden decree summons me.

Again—
Atop the Jade Peak,
I know there are three plots of land.

As the Ren-water nourishes the golden sprout,
Ten thousand bushels of pearls cannot compare.
One grain of hemp, one grain of wheat—
Consumed, they bring natural peace.
Cultivating life and nature,
The body endures, years extend,
Drawing near to cloud-and-mist companions.
Beyond yin and yang,
Heaven and earth cannot constrain.
Attaining the Dao, I escape rebirth,
Weary of the world, I retreat—
To ancient temples in sacred halls.
Through effortless merit and practice,
Truly perfected, I ascend to the Origin.
Six *zhu* of silk draped,
My true form appears,
Roaming the Three Isles and Ten Continents.

Again—
By the Red Lotus Pool,
No mountain scenery can rival this.
Amidst the bustle, yet untroubled in heart,
The body like a lotus—
Emerging from mud, its blossom serene.
The wondrous realm of the Gourd Heaven,
Holds a spring eternal through all four seasons.
Truly responsive to things,
Radiant with jewel-like light—
Who through the ages has understood?
With true practice of virtue and power,
Manifesting transformation, evil returns to right.
Words adapt, voices follow,
Only to keep the inch of spirit free from illness.
Greed and strife exhausted,
The Dao-eye opens naturally.
Beyond this world,
Merging with the imperial capital,
Accumulating deeds of constant equality.

Again—
Friend Wang Xu,
Today we part once more.
When shall we meet again?
Perhaps next year,
When autumn returns anew.
Once a year we gather,
How many times in a hundred years?
For now, sit awhile,
Let the mind rest from haste—
Sun and moon rise and set.
Worldly honor and disgrace,
Disgrace like the moon’s waning light.
Little joy, much worry,
Thinking of love and attachment,
Weary of speaking of right and wrong.
As the Heavenly Origin nears its end,
I urge you—hasten to cultivate the true.
Roam the grotto heavens,
Dwell in pine-clad peaks,
At ease, peruse the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*.

**Jade Hall Spring (Two Poems)**

Virtue and power, pure and level,
The worthy are truly easy to transform.
Worldly dreams seen as empty—
How many let go?
Weary of filth, dwelling in clarity,
The celestial cycle turns through hexagrams.
The body is a wandering hermitage,
A home wherever it goes.
Nurturing the perfect radiance,
Azure emptiness, no clinging—
Hanging naturally, a thousand miles of limpid clarity.
Beyond things, carefree,
Unfettered, truly at ease.
The awakened transcend,
While learners remain entangled.

Again—
In the immortal’s temple, numinous and void,
For two years, coming and going.
Broken, then rebuilt,
The star-crown nurtures simplicity.
Responding with true non-being,
Fasting and rituals relieve ten thousand sufferings.
Understanding principle, forgetting words,
Dwelling in stillness.
Dao, Buddha, Confucian—vast,
Together as the Three Teachings,
Beyond the door, the Five Constants:
Reverence, humility, worthiness, and trust.
Free from the four marks of the mind,
Naturally, joy abounds.
Beyond yin and yang,
The primordial appears.

**Treading Clouds (Nine Poems of Treading the Sedge)**

On the twelfth day of mid-winter, in the year *xinyou*,
Passing through the Great Origin Residence,
At dawn’s gate, I suddenly beheld
Southeastern rosy clouds.
Freely brushed—

Gazing afar to the southeast,
Brilliant hues divide the radiance.

Suddenly, I saw the path to Binzhou.
Through jiao rites, resonance calls upon the lofty perfected,
For in years past, there was the noble Liu.
Virtue fills the ten directions, saving boundless beings.
Myriad purities, myriad virtues—principles vast and profound.

One day, returning to Penglai,
The wondrous Dao of non-action holds no falsehood.

---

Seventy years of light,
Fifty-two myriad.
Guard against the unforeseen, the limitless impermanence.
Cast aside this borrowed form, descend to yellow springs—
Through life’s changes, time’s praises resound.

Suddenly awakened to the numinous peak,
Truly transcending the other shore.
Shedding form, ascending to the cloudy Han,
Once the celestial origin is passed, there is no return.
The treaders of sedge—none can catch them.

---

The sagely Dao is rare to meet,
Yet true cultivation is easily encountered.
The natural principle illumines past and present.
Death and life trade bones a thousand times,
But this time, fully realized—no coming, no going.

In Penglai’s immortal land,
Primordial numinosity knows no suffering.
On the road to audience with the origin, the lofty perfected approve.
Pines wither, seas shift—yet this endures forever.
In years to come, ten thousand ancestors escape the yin府.

---

Mother and child reunite,
Naturally enlightened to the Dao.
Emerging from the shell of things, free from birth and old age.
Thatched hut, pines, and bamboo ever as neighbors.

In tranquil seclusion, the immortal’s home is fine.
Reverent faith in the lofty and bright—
True joy knows no vexation.
Each must cultivate life and destiny early.
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, escape the wheel of rebirth,
Shedding form to ride the crane back to Penglai.

---

Last year at Zhou Pavilion,
This year I return again.
Time flies like an arrow, hastening man’s old age.
Seeing through worldly emptiness, best to rest the heart—
Begin cultivation early, with resolve.

Unwilling to forget attachments,
Regret and remorse will follow.
On Pine Peak, delight in the Dao, content with fate’s provisions.
From nothingness refine mercury and lead,
Then ride the clouds and crane back to Penglai.

---

Children and gold shackles,
Love’s jade fetters—
A fiery pit, a prison cell, the body like a convict.
Bewildered, one becomes like a spring silkworm,
Swiftly break free, guard the void within.

Day and night in haste,
Crow flies, hare runs—
Floating bubbles arise and perish, form cannot endure.
Hasten to cultivate life and destiny, escape the wheel of rebirth,
Perfect merit and conduct to befriend Penglai’s immortals.

---

Disordered by dregs and wine,
Nourished by jade nectar—
Do not be deluded by existence; seek in non-existence.
From the twelve-tiered tower gaze toward Penglai,

Where wisdom’s gaze shines bright, light knows no bounds.
True joy abounds, roaming through grotto-heavens.
How many through the ages have known the Dao’s mystery?
Shouldering clouds, strolling into cinnabar skies,
Returning to the Great Canopy, the office of non-action.

---

Wherever one dwells is home, like the quail’s nest unattached.
Ready to depart, one wanders the clouds at will.
Beyond yin and yang, things cannot constrain;
Chang’an is but a footstep away, not truly distant.
The Dao’s joy lies in the subtle and serene, beyond life and death.
From the primal origin, a single gleam flashes like lightning,
Naturally illuminating the void,
With life pure and flawless, cultivation is complete.

---

Three years since parting, returning to this place,
The cloud hermitage is still, the heart’s intent forgotten.
At times, delighting in the perusal of immortal scriptures,
Naturally, principles are grasped, true clarity attained.
True joy lies in the subtle and serene; the Dao is revered, virtue noble.
All is relinquished, nothingness embraced, joy and sorrow forgotten.
In the secluded grotto-heaven, the clamor of the world is merged,
To ascend the cloud-path, first transcend this.

---

*Three Poems Lamenting the Yellow Flowers*

Countless are the transgressions of sentient beings,
Vast as the heavens.
Awaken to the world as a dream, know its emptiness,
Do not contend over self and others.
Adapt to love and hate, without strife, without calamity.
In matters before the eyes, suddenly see through and understand.
Revere the Dao, cultivate cause and effect,
Tightly bind the monkey of the mind.
Attain the natural true wisdom,
In walking, standing, sitting, and lying.
Comprehending principles, enlightened,
The immortal scriptures transcend the mundane, never falling.
Hidden in grotto-heavens,
How many have there been through the ages?

---

The celestial epoch nears its end, last year’s hexagrams exhausted.
In this worldly dream, karmic ties—when will they cease?
When the three inches of breath no longer come, all turn to bare skulls.
At such a time, worldly thoughts and the heart are extinguished.
The Dao’s spirit is truly inexhaustible, worldly karma forgotten.
Awakening to myriad wisdoms and thousandfold insights,
Suddenly all is clear.
Outwardly appearing foolish and dull,
Chanting and laughing like a wind-blown lamp.
Joy knows no bounds,
Let all things come to their end.

The Great Elder departs,
Lodging at a common inn.
Just as in former years,
Like Pang and Xu, blending with the world.
Eating meat, yet cherishing living beings;
Drinking wine, but never to excess.
Willing to forget greed,
Casually discussing past and present.
The joy of the immortals’ realm,
Roaming freely on cloud paths.
Cultivating nature beyond the world,
As the golden crow follows the jade hare.
Walking to visit Penglai Mountain,
Once the work is done, leaving the dusty realm.
Shedding the mortal form,
Paying homage to Father Danyang.

*Three Green Apricot Songs*

In the ninth month, autumn’s chill descends.
Grateful to the noble lord,
Who again offers the nectar of clouds.
Hard to bear such profound gifts and boundless kindness—
In this world, fame and profit,
Greed and strife, worldly cares,
Leave the body seated but the heart restless.
The Dao’s transformation fears impermanence.
For thirty years,
All reverence to Danyang.
In Donglai, the entire prefecture harbors no falsehoods.
The celestial epoch celebrates this gathering.
This time, returning,
One appears before the Heavenly Emperor.

---

Thinking of the Jade Nectar of the Dao,
Attaining true joy,
Laughing heartily, haha!
Naturally drunk, carefree and blissful,
By mountains and waters,
Beyond the cloud-grottoes,
Singing with delight afterward.
The world’s scenes rush by like a shuttle.
Clinging to Mount Grace,
Waves upon waves.
If one turns back to return to the True One,
Refining lead and mercury,
Once the work is complete and merit fulfilled,
Ascending into the misty heavens.

---

The deluded are like river sands.

Thinking of the world’s scholars, thick as hemp,
Ten thousand revere and believe, yet none awaken.
Gazing now and looking back through time,
This floating life is but a muddled dream—
Each and every one has strayed.
Those who comprehend must not boast or brag.
Seek the grotto-heavens, lie at ease amidst mist and clouds.
Only in the years to come, upon returning, will they know:
The Jasper Terrace and the Park of Lang,
Where immortals dwell in joy,
And four-season immortal blossoms bloom.

*Two Poems on "Spring at Wuling"*

From afar, the hills of Gang Mountain stand just right,
Luminous and fragrant in their splendor.
A fine season, spring’s warmth, spring’s long days—
Best to float upon the nectar of rosy clouds.
Drunken and singing, carefree, forgetting worldly cares,
Laughing and smiling, surpassing reckless abandon.
Coming and going between the land of immortals and the realm of Dao,
Passing through, we celebrate the Double Ninth.

*Again*

In mid-spring of the Xin-You year, wandering to Kan’s heights,
All day seated in the spring garden.
Rare scenes, wondrous blossoms before my eyes,
Beneath the trees, surpassing the bamboo pavilion.
Knowing the world’s dream is empty, I let it go,
At ease, like a true immortal.
Fine wine is poured, the cup shared with worthy companions,
Rejoicing in the Dao, I thank the lofty heavens.

*Two Poems on "Grateful for Imperial Grace"*

Daoism, Buddhism, and the Confucian gate,
Truly penetrate the ocean of dharma.
Beyond the subtleties of *Yi*’s yin and yang,
One naturally understands.
The Diamond’s supreme truth,
Instantly dissolves strife and erases attachment.
The five thousand profound words,
Pacify and illuminate the great.

A faint light revolves,
Weaving into a canopy of clouds.
Rosy radiance ever illumines the body—
What hindrance could there be?
Though pines wither and rocks crumble,
The ancient truth endures unchanged.
When merit and conduct are complete in years to come,
Ascend to the immortal realms.

*Again*

The sacred temple is called "Heaven’s Eternity,"
With starry crown and cloud-woven robes.
Nurturing a body of gold and jade,
Truly imperishable.
Knowing the great Dao,
Naturally reveals being from non-being.
The world’s splendor holds no allure for the heart,
As I wander to Wangwu.
Outwardly poor, preserving life,
Concealing truth in humble abode.
From the beginning, formless and without appearance,
Yet surpassing abundance.
Though mulberry fields turn to seas,
This unshaped one endures.
Silently I pray for our emperor’s virtue,
To match the heavens in longevity.

*Gazing Afar at the Journey*

Your offspring, of noble lineage,
Tread the cloud-wandering path with ease.
Suddenly awakened,
The subtle wonders of the unseen and inaudible are clear through the ages.
Having traversed the dusty world,
I see no companions in all directions.
Whether the world loves or scorns,
The perfected ones permit it.

Having mastered the Dao and fulfilled nature and life,
Forever freed from the suffering of rebirth.
Dwelling in blessed lands,
Amidst pine peaks and cloud grottoes, at ease.
Waiting until gold-lead and jade-mercury are refined,
Truly without turbid cares.
Donning the six *zhu* robe,
Only then will I ascend past the Three Clarities.

*Four Poems on "Calming the Waves"*

Before the ritual, all gentlemen purify their conduct,
Moving heaven, evoking responses—blessings no light matter.
The celestial moisture nourishes jade-like fields, farmers rejoice,
Autumn’s harvest comes.
Grain fields sprout pearls, bean shoots grow.
To repay heaven’s grace, exalt virtue and the Dao,
Follow conditions, be content, and do not contend.
Each day, gaze afar, burn incense, and dine on plain fare,
Without hatred.
A mind at peace, words spoken like a sage’s scripture.

*Again*

Sweet rain falls in season, precious as oil,
Today’s joy leaves no room for sorrow.
Tomorrow night, singing while plowing the wild fields,
Scold the ox—
A light flick of the whip surpasses all cultivation.

Beyond Heaven’s Origin, deeds are hard to accumulate,
A sesame seed, a grain of wheat—harvested in an inch’s space.
Once the Crimson Infant is nurtured, one ascends beyond the clouds,
At ease—
Life’s radiance round as the autumn moon’s first glow.

Again

Once a month, burn incense, fast at the sun’s gaze,
Observe these precepts to dissolve calamity.
On *jiazi* and *gengshen* days, mark the seventh cycle,
Rejoice—
The spirits of officials and gods arrive in due time.

With body and mind purified, free from sickness and suffering,
Nurture true nature, preserve life, and move through the Three Terraces.
When merit and deeds are complete, where shall one go?
Ah—
Riding clouds, straddling a crane, off to Penglai.

Again

The *gui* door sealed by clouds, the hexagram’s lines in motion,
Pierce open the numinous aperture where tiger and dragon entwine.
From *mao* to *you*, the true vision unfolds,
Lofty Kun—
The Golden Elder spins his thread to hook the jade sea-turtle.

The Dao and virtue clear, the Dharma sea luminous,
Myriad lights manifest, the Nine Heavens high.
Creation moves naturally, the spirit’s workings turn—
Beyond containment.

The ancient and modern enlightened gather in the ranks of immortals.
*Gazing Toward Penglai* (*Wang Jiangnan*), Six Poems

Zhou Pavilion departs,
Zhuang’s wrappings once more invite.
The thought of the Dao ever as if awakened in meeting,
The celestial origin comprehended—life and death transcended.
Myriad karmas instantly dissolved and gone.

Great fortune arrives,
The precious mirror shines bright and clear.
The Three Realms and ten directions fully illuminated,
Why trouble with water burning in fire?
Attaining the Dao, yet not yet free.

Again

Nearing middle age,
The heart hopes for a century’s span.
All things, when turned to look back, are but a single dream,
The two—sin and blessing—closely follow.
Those who contemplate the Dao know the sages.

Life and nature understood,
Rare in this world, past or present.
Clear and unborn, truly undying,
Naturally conjoined are Kan and Li.
Seek not the ladder to heaven.

Again

The Clear River rejoices,
The Daoist register marks high merit.
Already thirty years within the Dao’s gate,
On Qin Terrace in *xinyou*, we meet again.
Following transformation, good affinities abound.

In years to come,
Ascending into the Great Veil.
Clad in six *zhu* robes, paying homage to the Supreme Sage,
This time dwelling forever in the Nine Yang Palace.
When the time comes, ride the wind.

The chief arrives,
The prefect then extends his invitation.
Bidden to sit within the Hidden Spring Hall,
At whatever hour—dawn or clear morning—
True blessing dissolves through the Dao’s power.

To draw near the rite,
Hasten swift as the wind’s drift.
The Daoist Lingxu divides his portion,
The young disciple joins to tend the burning.
Worthy sages dwell in cinnabar skies.

Again

No dharma surpasses its way.
