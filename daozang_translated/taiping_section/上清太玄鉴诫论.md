**The Supreme Clarity Treatise on the Great Mystery’s Mirror of Admonitions**
*Composed by the Divine Dweller of Guye Mountain, the Cavernous Master of the Great Mystery*

**Eulogy:**
Straight words hold the ultimate truth—why fear the judgments of men?
Pointing the way to the path of cool clarity, lifting one from the pit of karmic fire.
Not seeking the weight of the noble, who fears the scorn of the petty?
Speech and silence align with Heaven’s principle; a loyal heart speaks of universal peace.

The Great Dao is silent and formless, vast and without image.
Primal harmony blended before the dawn of the Great Beginning;
mysterious subtlety endowed beyond Heaven and Earth.
Naturally empty and without, life arises from the realm of form.
Within the profound obscurity of sensed images, the law adheres to the principle of utter stillness.
True qi transforms into truth, true essence transforms into spirit;
spirit and truth unite with the Dao.

The Dao is One.
One gives rise to Two, Two gives rise to Three, Three gives rise to the myriad things.
Among the myriad things, [humankind] is the most numinous and noble—
noble in the cultivation of truth.
Truth is constancy.
Yet in daily life, people remain unaware.
Awareness resides in the heart of the human.
The heart is the spirit within the Gate of Joy.
Within the spirit lies truth, truth’s root is perfect clarity.
Nature arises from purity, yet follows emotions into disorder,
turning away from right and true.

You do not reflect on whence you came in life, nor whither you go in death.
Let go of thoughts of the past, cease pondering the future—
you remain in the dark.
Seize the present moment, and it will grant you
unfettered ease, radiant and unobstructed,
to become a person of clarity.
Neither Heaven nor Earth can claim you, ghosts and spirits have no jurisdiction.
Your body like the great void, your nature without peer.
Abiding in yang yet unscorched, dwelling in yin yet uncorrupted.
Water and fire cannot harm you, mountains and seas cannot bar your way.
You penetrate Heaven and Earth, pierce metal and stone.
Solitary and self-contained, your singular form roams free.
Transforming into the radiance of sun and moon,
you become the perfect Dharma-body.

Those who attain this know its reality.
Without straying from the path, they avoid lifelong error.
Preserving the sagely work in full,
they transcend life and escape death.
Why is this so?

Just as casting bronze or iron statues requires a mold,
so too does the cultivation of immortality depend on a master.
Their finger-pointings and profound mechanisms
clearly distinguish host and guest, movement and stillness,
purity and turbidity, ascent and descent, floating and sinking—
the three essentials within and without.
Where this method exists, all merges into oneness.

In the midst of pure and tranquil cultivation,
nothing is not done within the realm of activity.
Yet grasping this wondrous mechanism
naturally entails obstacles.
The subtle and marvelous method cannot be recklessly spoken;
in brief, at the critical moment,
discern the great and small, the fine and minute within the compass,
distinguishing correctly without error,
so that even unto death and throughout life, no hindrance remains.

Should one follow this method,
the celestial mechanism shall be transmitted thereafter.
The Most High said: *"To see the small is called clarity."*
And again: *"To die yet not perish is called longevity."*
Master Pingshu said: *"Even a hair’s deviation fails to form the elixir."*
And further: *"Discuss it in detail with the immortals,
but do not speak carelessly to delude the masses,
leading others into the cycle of birth and death,
and thus misleading their very lives.
If such a heart exists within you,
Heaven and Earth will not protect you.
Your left eye shall weep pus, your right eye blood;
your body shall be severed into ten thousand pieces,
forever cast into Fengdu,
never to receive rebirth in the world."*

There are those of dull roots and shallow wisdom
who harbor disbelief, fostering strife between self and others.
In secret, they spread praise and slander,
having pilfered a phrase or two of cryptic words,
twisting them in black and white to confuse others.
They themselves do not practice, yet urge others toward purity,
all while behaving like beasts—
their understanding fit only to graze,
clinging to wine, lust, wealth, and temper,
unable to sever stinginess, greed, jealousy, or envy.
Day after day, they cling to wives and children,
indulging in idle chatter and vulgar speech—
how can they ever attain true awakening?
Without treading the path in truth and practice,
how can they not ruin their future?

A hymn declares:
Jealousy turns to wrath in rebirth,
lewdness strips the heart of kindness.
Day by day, they chase the path of profit,
hour by hour, they cling to the red dust.
Swine and dogs remain their constant companions,
foxes and raccoons their nightly kin.
If lustful thoughts remain unsevered,
how dare they speak of celestial truth?

All Daoists who seek immortal cultivation
must rely on resolute generosity—
a single blade, two clean cuts,
severing love, parting from kin,
dispelling passion, forsaking desire,
diminishing thoughts, forgetting schemes,
pure as ice, flawless as jade,
single-minded and unwavering.
Seek masters, inquire of the Dao,
cultivate with steadfast sincerity.

The Most High has said:
Though surrounded by splendor,
dwell in transcendent ease.
"Transcendent ease" means to distance oneself and not reside therein.

Another scripture states:
For those who cultivate the Dao,
seclusion in deep mountains and secluded grottoes,
cut off from fowl and hound,
severing right and wrong,
turning the mind inward—
no need for external seeking.
Only when all thoughts cease to arise,
all entanglements remain unstained,
can one become a true renunciant,
a carefree person of the Dao.

From ancient times to the present,
never has one clung to a wife and attained the Dao,
nor embraced a child and ascended as an immortal.
Now I admonish you:
restrain your anger,
for it constantly kindles fire.
Yet some cite Liezi, who attained the Dao while at home.
Fools who know not the truth—
Liezi was a great sage,
a recluse in his own home.
Do not think you, too, can become a recluse.

A hymn declares:
Words soar like dragons before them,
deeds limp like rags behind.
Though immortality remains unachieved,
karmic deeds are already set.
Lustful as wild birds,
lecherous beyond mountain beasts—
if your heart remains that of a beast,
do not dream of heaven’s favor.

When first embarking on the path,
burning incense and making vows,
seeking masters and inquiring of the Dao—
all those fine words spoken,
yet when put to the test, they fail to fit.
The mouth does not match the heart.
Though I might explain the wondrous Dao,
reveal the celestial mechanism,
I thought you a man I had nurtured,
only to find you but a common being.
Now, having barely grasped some minor dharma,
you grow slick and crafty,
mocking others with poetry and verse,
your heart filled with cunning,
your intent devoid of kindness,
boasting of your own superiority,
establishing your own sect.
Among the Daoists of this world,
how can such "worthy gentlemen"
not provoke cold laughter?

Day after day, they deceive heaven and earth,
betray righteousness, forsake loyalty,
turn kindness into resentment,
boast of sudden enlightenment,
claiming their hearts have opened,
cursing masters, reviling ancestors—
all without a trace of wrongdoing.
Do not speak of "no wrongdoing"—
just try to provoke them,
and see how they drag you before the magistrate,
ready to thrash your donkey’s hide.

Know this:
the lives of all people
are moved by the great Dao,
which silently observes their good and evil.

The scripture says:
The net of heaven is vast,
loose yet never failing.
Behold the present world—
beauty and ugliness,
wealth and nobility,
poverty and lowliness—
all stem from seeds sown in past lives.
You claim to have grasped the celestial mechanism,
asserting all things are without hindrance,
yet one day, heaven’s punishment will come,
striking you deaf, blind, lame, and crippled.
In such a state, how will you transform?
How will you apply the Dao?

Without merit or practice,
you dare seek to become an immortal—
yet I fear you will not comply,
defying heaven and earth,
acting in secret without kindness,
indulging in lust, coveting gain,
breaking precepts, violating vows.
With such deeds and sins,
one day heaven will break your heels,
condemning your corpse to the underworld’s lash,
endless remorse without end.

I bestow upon you this karmic mirror,
only to see you later as a painted-brow insect,
a monstrous being with a human body and beastly face,
provoking laughter and shame.
Dare not speak of the Dao or discuss cultivation,
for if you do not believe now,
time will reveal the truth to all.

A hymn declares:
Those who study the Dao without resolve
merely wield clever tongues.
Ever restless as a galloping horse,
ever unruly as a mischievous ape,
lurking with lustful demons in secret,
boasting of purity before others.
With such deep karmic retribution,
one day heaven’s judgment will fall.

Daoists,
such beings seek the truth
with the heart of one who murders masters and fathers,
turn from the Dao
with the intent of a lecher who defiles kin.
Why is this so?
Having sought the truth and obtained the dharma,
they return to harbor resentment,
gratitude forgotten,
grudges ever in mind—
is this not the malice of one who murders masters and fathers?

Though they study the Dao,
if greed and love remain unsevered,
lustful thoughts unremoved,
constantly behaving with the understanding of swine and dogs,
acting with the manners of oxen and donkeys—
is this not the intent of one who defiles kin?

The Buddha said:
All men are my fathers,
all women are my mothers.
With such conduct,
how can they hope to be good people?
Day after day, they toy with me,
provoking my anger,
yet I remain unmoved.
Why unmoved?
Fools are like dung—
without dung, plants and trees cannot grow.
Without fools, the wise would not emerge.

Yet some beings harass and harm,
spreading slander and strife,
boasting of their own cleverness.
So you, too, are clever,
having learned some minor dharma.
Able to gallop about,
stealing a phrase or two,
they wield it like a blade to behead—
know that kindness arises from harm.

A hymn declares:
Bestowing kindness breeds harm,
compassion turns to enmity.
Morning to night, lost in wine and lust,
day after day, craving rank and foul.
Borrowing another’s fire,
yet failing to extinguish one’s own smoke.
I urge you: abandon cunning,
for the blue heavens watch and reflect.

There are those who,
having barely obtained the dharma,
fail to comprehend it,
yet rush to entrust me with such celestial secrets,
warning, "Do not recklessly transmit this to others."
Soon after, they betray me,
establishing their own sects,
slandering the ancient worthies.
Know this:
it is better to strangle one than to teach one,
for such unprincipled conduct
is but a hammer for hell’s foundation.

Before they can cultivate the Dao,
they first commit sins,
even selling the Dao for a living,
hoarding dharma for sustenance.
Tea comes, tea-talk;
wine comes, wine-words.
Gathering in twos and threes,
they gossip and criticize,
discussing others’ strengths and flaws,
never reflecting on their own.
That lifeless body of yours—
where will it tumble when it falls?
At every turn, your face shifts like a monkey’s.

The Dao is thus—yet in all this, nothing is accomplished. How can one be so frivolous, yet still insist on becoming an immortal? Rare is the one unmoved by the eight winds; even in silence, you come to vex me with such stifling gloom.

With such madness and inversion, the wild heart unchecked, desire unsevered—you are like a wingless bee, flitting from sweetness to sweetness, limbs entangled, unable to right yourself. You stumble on level ground, then shift the blame: *"Fate did not favor me, this life was not meant for profit."* Have you not heard the ancients say: *"Heaven and earth care not for all things—one seeks death, not life."*

When urged toward immortality, you claim it is all predestined fate, that you lack the fortune. Yet you forget: every person has their share, each is perfectly luminous. The scripture says: *"Abide in non-desire to perceive its mystery; abide in desire to perceive its manifestations."* Desire and non-desire—both arise from the human heart. This is called *"same origin, different names."* Different—each distinct. Why is this so?

Abide ever in non-desire to still the heart, thereby opening the Heavenly Eye to recognize the wondrous awareness of the numinous void—your spirit-chamber radiant, solitary and whole, drifting beyond the world of forms. Transformed into a luminous-eyed celestial immortal, this is what it means to say: *"Every person has their share, each is perfectly luminous."*

Disciples of the Dao, let me present you with a case for immortal cultivation. Do not harbor disbelief; examine it closely. If you fail to complete it in this life, do not hope for the next. Should you return, you may find yourself tangled in some unknown stable’s trough, wallowing in filth. Have you not heard: *"To lose the human form is to be barred for ten thousand kalpas"*? If you still doubt, go where none can see, clasp your hands, and ponder deeply.

**Verse:**
With eloquent words you speak of merit,
Yet dwell ever amid wine and sensuality.
Unversed in the sacred teachings,
You establish your own sect’s ways.
Your nature stained by red dust,
Your body trapped in the fiery household.
One misguided thought at death’s door,
And you plunge forever into the abyss of emptiness.

Disciples, how many among you truly practice the Dao, severing ties of kinship and love? Day by day, you are like a stray donkey, leaving no trace on the shore, loitering around the monastery, clamoring and quarreling, tongues wagging, flailing in chaos, indulging in reckless abandon, vying over self and others. Yet when questioned, you fall silent, feigning virtue, saying nothing of substance—merely winning an empty reputation, grand in appearance but hollow, even if you were to ram heaven and earth, nothing would be seen.

Speak not of your *"original face"*—what is this *"original face"* of yours? A blind beast, nothing more. Before you lies a path to liberation, yet you refuse to seek it, instead deceiving and confusing others. Though your body has left the household life, your heart remains entangled in worldly thoughts. In the presence of others, you posture and perform; when alone, you sigh in secret. With such weak resolve and indecision, you are like a muddy sow, dragging filth behind you, neither capable nor swift, mumbling and stammering. How can you not squander the offerings of the ten directions’ patrons? What will you repay them with in the end?

You have but one recourse: to pull the plow or bear the yoke—this will be your karmic retribution in the next life. Yet when scolded, you retort: *"A single child leaving home brings offerings from all the heavens."* Disciples, to practice the Dao with such a heart is like painting a cake—shameless. You flaunt your so-called cultivation, claiming *"no words, no teachings,"* but who told you this? You shiftless wretch, what did you accomplish the day you left home? Have you no care for your own nature and life, so quick to believe others’ words?

If *"no words, no teachings"* is the way, then the entire *Great Treasury of Scriptures* is but a deception. The Most High said: *"I attained the true Dao not by nature alone, but through learning."* Lord Lü said: *"Without a teacher’s guidance, this matter is difficult to know."* If there are no words, no transmission, then the sages of antiquity were also liars. You claim *"non-action and purity"* as cultivation, yet Master Leran said: *"Non-action and purity are two cartloads of dung."* If you deny they are dung, then your entire body—from head to toe—is but a heap of foul, maggot-ridden filth.

**Ancient Verse:**
The upper orifices—eye gunk and phlegm,
The middle orifices—mucus and saliva,
The lower orifices—feces and urine.
Essence, fluids, blood, flesh,
Bones, skin, hair—are these not filth, maggot-food?

Yet you speak of *"true purity in cultivation."* True purity is the lofty, boundless Great Mystery, still and formless. True purity is the luminous Dharma-eye, casting off the false to return to the real, recognizing the original luminous pearl of spirit, exchanging the mortal coil for the immortal, shedding the impure bones. Your body becomes like empty space, your nature like the sun and moon—this is called purity. All filth cannot defile it.

As for *"non-action,"* what non-action do you guard? Each day you are like a pile of chaff. Now you sit in meditation, face twisted in anger, dredging up idle thoughts from a thousand years past, your mind a clamor. Yet you still claim *"non-action."* Throughout the twelve hours—hauling firewood, carrying water, dressing, eating, walking, sitting, lying down—how is any of this non-action? Even your bowels and bladder press upon you, and soon you rush to the dung heap. This is not non-action.

True non-action is to recognize the solitary, numinous awareness beyond the world, the celestial truth—bright as the blazing sun, radiant as the autumn moon, illuminating heaven and earth with crystalline clarity, unstained by dust. Only when you grasp this teaching can you be called *"pure and non-active."* Ignorant of the sages’ true meaning, you mistake laziness for cultivation, like a boundary marker—neither pulled forward nor pushed back. You shiftless wretch, so dull and weak, unable to discern truth from falsehood. I reckon even heaven has no use for such inept immortals.

**Verse:**
Where is the true treasure?
Vainly you boast and tangle in vines.
Knowing only the nest of the sparrow,
How could you see the whale or roc?
Short in conduct, you brag of cunning,
Your merits undone by self-praise.
Without deceit, your evil karma
Would not multiply ten thousandfold.

Then there are those who stray even further from reason, like solitary herbs in the monastery. No comings or goings, doors sealed each day. When a patron arrives with alms, you scurry to greet them, nimble as a monkey, yet dare to show no reverence to the Perfected Ones. To all wise and discerning gentlemen of the ten directions: when you later encounter such clueless fools, kick them to the ground, split their noses with wooden pegs, pry open their donkey lips to pour in thin excrement, then flush them with urine—such beings, so estranged from true principle, defile the Perfected Ones.

The Ode says:
A flock of mortals blindly throngs,
Chasing waves into the muddy ford.
They slight the Lord of Darkest Mystery,
Defile the Most High with meat and wine.
Unclear of the true and proper teaching,
They delude themselves and enter deviant gates.
In death they suffer the ceaseless torments,
Their bodies pierced by ten thousand swords.

O Daoist assembly, it is not that I lack compassion—it is that you lack humaneness, and so I rage against you. It is that you possess the perception of beasts, and so I treat you as mere creatures.

Now I earnestly exhort you to avoid future sorrow. Bitter words are good medicine; harsh speech is loyal advice. Why is this so? Good words are not sweet; sweet words are not good. Those who embrace true goodness gain the blessings of Heaven; those who commit the gravest evil suffer the torments of Hell. The tally of karmic offenses is clear—it all depends on what one does. In the pursuit of the Dao, hesitation is fatal: one stroke severs all, as cleanly as a blade through iron. Turn your heart, awaken, and become a carefree, unbound wanderer.

Consider the gravity of life and death. Even if you have children and grandchildren in throngs, gold and silver filling your storehouses, in the end it all comes to nothing. This treasure of life cannot be bought with wealth, nor can this matter of life and death be taken on by one’s children. Like climbers on a steep slope, each must strive for themselves. Be sincere and cautious, banish all doubt, accumulate merit and deeds, sever the deviant and uphold the true, refine the spirit to merge with the Dao, until the Dao unites with the spirit in truth. Utmost mystery, utmost wonder, utmost purity, utmost subtlety—exhaust all effort in this. Such is the essential path of cultivating practice and studying immortality.

The Ode says:
Eyes strain to see children and grandchildren,
Gold and silver fill the storehouse.
But when the hour of life and death arrives,
Both matters dissolve into emptiness.
Hearken early to seek the true path,
Open the eye of wisdom to see clearly.
The radiance of spirit shines bright as the sun,
Soaring to the Palace of Supreme Numinosity.

Another Ode says:
All rests in the Primordial Ancestor,
All returns to the Most High’s school.
Every head receives its mandate,
Every thing connects in mutual resonance.
It embraces the image of Qian’s origin,
Contains the great beginning within.
To fathom the ancient root,
Recognize the Palace of Fivefold Clarity.

The *Mirror of Supreme Clarity’s Admonitions and Warnings* concludes.
