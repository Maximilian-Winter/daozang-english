**Preface to *The Supreme Perfected One’s Scripture on Inquiring About Illness from the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure***

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Radiance and Treasure Repository was in the World of Benevolent Worthies beneath the Dragon’s Teeth Mountain, beneath the *Qianhua* Tree in the Northern Dragon’s Mysterious Realm. With the assembly of the ten directions’ great sagely hosts—numbering hundreds of thousands of myriads—all gathered upon their dharma seats, they deliberated, discoursed, and meticulously examined the Great Vehicle scriptures, which are called the *Five Thousand Characters*.

Day and night, they savored their shared discourse as though never sated, never weary, never fatigued, never remiss. From the four directions came those who had attained the Dao, those nearing its fruition, those yet to attain it, and those who had already done so—such multitudes as numerous as the grains of sand. There were also the Four Heavenly Kings, the Heavenly Kings of Brahma-qi, the Heavenly Emperor Śakra of the ten directions, the thousand myriads of Kunlun Kings, all those governed by the Kunlun, the thirty-two Brahma Heavenly Kings and spirits of the heavens, the demon kings of the heavens, the spirit kings of mountains and seas, the spirit kings of the Yang Valley—numbering hundreds of thousands of myriads.

The beings of the Three Realms, both human and non-human, all those with blood in their veins, numbered hundreds of thousands of myriads. The ninety-eight kinds of externalist beings, along with their gods and spirits, also numbered hundreds of thousands of myriads. There were also the Wheel-Turning Sage Kings, the Heavenly Sons of the Sun and Moon, and the heavenly sons of the ten directions’ worlds—numbering hundreds of thousands of myriads. Each arrived with their mounts, palaces, wives, and concubines beneath the *Qianhua* Tree to hear the Heavenly Worthy expound the Dharma.

The meaning of the Great Vehicle scriptures is profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom in detail. None among these multitudes could comprehend it, yet though they could not understand, their hearts rejoiced, forgetting all worldly defilements. Each scattered fragrant flowers to make offerings to the Heavenly Worthy, praying for clarity and understanding.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “What I expound—the Great Vehicle scriptures and the matters of the Three Attainments—cannot be comprehended.”

Among the assembly were the eternally abiding High Perfected Ones, as well as the High Perfected Ones of the past and present—numbering hundreds of thousands of myriads. Among them were eighty-six thousand great disciples of the Great Vehicle who had attained perfect clarity. Their names were: Perfected One of Primordial Beginning, Perfected One of the Heavenly Sovereign, Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Perfected One of the August Sovereign, Perfected One of the Supreme Sovereign, Perfected One of the Great One, Perfected One of Great Peace, Perfected One of Great Simplicity, Perfected One of Great Origin, Perfected One of the Radiant Sovereign, Perfected One of the Long Night, Perfected One of Orthodox Unity, Perfected One of Fixed Radiance, Perfected One of Lofty Grace, Perfected One of Wondrous Sound, Perfected One of Lingering Net, Perfected One of Great Emptiness, Perfected One of Mysterious Wonder, Perfected One of Wise Renown, Perfected One of Great Penetration, Perfected One of Boundless Measure, Perfected One of Mysterious Quiescence, Perfected One of Self-Mastery, Perfected One Who Governs the Three Realms, Perfected One of Great Strength, Perfected One of Boundless Power, Perfected One of Auspicious Marks, Perfected One of Luminous Understanding, Perfected One of Wisdom, Perfected One of Impermanence, Perfected One of the Guiding Master, Perfected One Who Shatters Evil, and Perfected One Who Preserves Longevity.

All these Perfected Ones had mastered the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, having cultivated the supreme practice in prior kalpas to attain their perfected state. Among the assembly were those of minor kalpas, as numerous as the grains of sand. In their former lives, they had no affinity for the Great Vehicle Dharma, and thus remained in minor kalpas. Yet upon hearing the Great Vehicle scriptures expounded, their hearts rejoiced, though none dared to ask questions.

Then the fifth disciple, the Perfected One of Non-Beginning, rose and made obeisance, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: “Now that the Great Vehicle Dharma is being expounded, many do not understand. None can grasp it, and they are unworthy to receive it. They can only make constant offerings, praying that in future lives they may attain the supreme perfection of the Perfected.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “I now expound the Great Vehicle Dharma, and you all comprehend it clearly. Yet in future kalpas, beings will be unable to grasp its purport.”

Thereupon, he raised his left hand and pointed to the fifth and sixth disciples—the Perfected One of Non-Beginning and the Perfected One of Fixed Radiance—saying: “You two shall serve as guiding masters in the Worthy Kalpa. You shall receive the title Heavenly Master of Non-Beginning, and Fixed Radiance shall receive the title Heavenly Master of Fixed Radiance.”

He then pointed to the seventh disciple, the Perfected One of Orthodox Unity, and the eighth disciple, the Perfected One of Mysterious Wonder, saying: “You two shall guide the Three Vehicles of my Dharma in the Defiled Kalpa. The Perfected One of Orthodox Unity shall receive the title Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, and the Perfected One of Mysterious Wonder shall receive the title Dharma Master of the Six Perfections.”

“You four disciples, through kalpas past, present, and future, shall gradually progress from the coarse to the subtle, and by virtue of the blessings of the great beings, the kings of nations, and the sons born of the wombs of Dharma Kings, you shall guide all sentient beings, deliver them from the sufferings of hell, transform the great destinies of the heavens, and diligently apply yourselves so that in the midst of the worthy and the defiled, they may come to know and understand the purport of my Dharma.”

“I now divide my body and disperse my titles, multiplying them into hundreds of thousands of myriads—this is because of the afflictions of illness. *Yi* is the first name, *Xi* the second, *Wei* the third. These are the foremost of the Three Vehicles, the beginning of the Three Caverns. Within them are divisions and dispersals, forming thousands of myriads of scriptures.”

“In the first kalpa to come, I shall be the Heavenly Treasure Lord in the Jade Clarity Palace—this is my first name. In the second kalpa, I shall be the Numinous Treasure Lord in the Purple Tenuity Palace—this is my second name. In the third kalpa, I shall be the Spirit Treasure Lord in the Great Ultimate Palace—this is my third name.”

It is said: “In the kalpas to come, the first shall abide in Jade Clarity, the second shall disperse the Numinous Treasure, and the third shall subdue demonic essences.”

“*Ling* (Numinous) is my first title, the father of the ten thousand things, who brings them to completion. *Bao* (Treasure) is my second title, the mother of the ten thousand things, who gives birth to their offspring.”

Thus, as the Lingbao Dharma, I shall deliver the multitude of beings in the turbid world of future kalpas, illuminating and guiding them with this Dharma, inscribing its texts upon the Void Sovereign.

I possess ten names: the first is "To Come," the second "Past," the third "Present," the fourth "Eternal Abode," the fifth "World-Guide," the sixth "Compassion," the seventh "Purity," the eighth "Vacuity," the ninth "Being and Nonbeing," and the tenth "Heaven and Earth." You all must reverently receive and remember these words.

At that moment, all the Perfected Ones, the Realized Ones from the four directions, the deva-princes, the kings, ghosts, and spirits—both human and nonhuman—rose together in homage, exclaiming in unison, "Excellent! May we come to know this."

Then, the Primordial Perfected One inquired further: "The Dharma you have spoken of branches into thousands of myriads, difficult to comprehend and fathom. Though I may come to understand it, the beings of the turbid world will surely fail to grasp it fully. I pray you speak in finer, more accessible terms, that all beings may attain clarity."

"The Heavenly Worthy endures manifold afflictions. I wish to hear you distinguish their causes—why such maladies arise, why their pain and torment are so unbearable, why they lead to death and transformation, why death is not mere death, nor transformation mere transformation. Though these are not the Heavenly Worthy’s own sorrows, I am ever anxious and distressed, for such suffering indeed exists."

The Heavenly Worthy smiled, and from his mouth issued eight-colored light, dense as clouds. He snapped his fingers and addressed the assembly: "Never before has such a question been asked. Now, this great disciple has skillfully inquired of me regarding the torments of death and illness. The matter of death is both difficult and easy to know. I shall now reveal the origins of these afflictions and expound upon them. All must quiet your minds.

The illnesses I bear arise from the kalpas—from the kalpa of existence to the kalpa of nonexistence—numberless as flowing sands, beyond reckoning. Yet this is not considered many, for I am ever afflicted, and all because I possess a body. To have a body is to have illness."

To neglect all who suffer death and ruin—this is my great illness.

I possess these seventy-two illnesses, bound for kalpas without escape, unable to free myself. Thus, I transform my form, disperse my qi, refine my spirit, and divide my body to become seventy-two sages. Among sages there are true ones; among the true there are ranks; among ranks there are chapters; among chapters there are verses; among verses there are words; among words there is qi; within qi there are images; within images there are subtleties; within subtleties there are refinements; within refinements there is nothingness; within nothingness there is being—this is called the subtle and wondrous.

Within the wondrous, the upper qi, though formless, forms the true body; the lower qi, though formed, becomes the fleshly body. Thus, water, fire, wind, and earth combine to form the four great elements of the body. My great illness arises from possessing these four great elements—without them, what affliction could there be? In truth, I have no four great elements; what great affliction could I have?

To know my body is to be my body; not to know my body is not to be my body. Knowing my body ensures its enduring existence; not knowing it leads to premature decay. Agonies fester in hell, ceaselessly cycling through the five destinies, revolving endlessly. Thus, I transform myself through this.

Without great merit, none can sever these bonds. The method to sever them is as heard and spoken.

My suffering in death arises from old age and illness. Birth inevitably leads to death; prosperity inevitably leads to decline. All beings share this law—none born escapes its end. Things sprout in spring, grow in summer, wither in autumn, and fade in winter. Success contains failure; heights harbor danger; safety holds sorrow; joy is fleeting, suffering enduring—who can comprehend this?

Death brings torment; the spirit struggles to transform. Sinking through endless nights, how bitter is the path! Though the heavens bring joy, they are ever haunted by impermanence. When the spirit scatters, the four great elements are hard to reunite, and the dwelling is difficult to return to.

This suffering is mine, yet not truly mine. My death is not death; my life is not life; my old age is not old age. Alas for those who cling to existence—what exists is not my true body; what does not exist is my true body. To call it death, to call it life—life and death are a pair, from which I am free. Those who remain bound are the sentient beings.

The great assembly, whether awakened or not, all at once wished to attain timely understanding, rose, bowed, and praised.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Those who cultivate the Great Vehicle to untie their bonds should, with every observance of the fast, wear the great talismans of the Three Caverns, bear the great registers of the Three Caverns and the契策, and in accordance with the Dharma, practice the Dao, recite scriptures, and persevere through the six periods without weariness.

The reason for establishing the six periods is that humans, born of the four great elements, possess the six emotions. If the six emotions are not dispelled, the roots of transgression remain. The first period dispels the eye; the second, the nose; the third, the mouth; the fourth, the ear; the fifth, the heart; the sixth, the hands. Practicing this day and night, the six emotions naturally dissolve, the six wisdoms become clear, and the Six Perfections are cultivated. Then, no obstructions remain; spiritual penetrations and demon-subduing powers are perfected, and one attains long life, enduring vision, free from all suffering, poison, worry, and vexation.

Lighting lamps illuminates the palace of the long night, liberating seven generations of parents and dispelling the darkness of all sentient beings’ parents in the world. Burning incense removes the foul impurities of the three realms, restoring fragrance and purity to hell. Like the fragrant herb *pingxiang*, also called *guiyao* or *yilan*, its scent pervades four hundred li, perfuming the beings of the three realms, transforming their qi. Illnesses are dispelled with aloeswood, sandalwood, frankincense, and other fragrant substances. The three realms and hells regain their fragrance and purity; souls and spirits are transformed, and beings are revived. The world rejoices, the six emotions vanish, and the five constants naturally subside.

When the five constants subside, one can repay the five virtues: first, parents; second, master and disciple; third, host or patron; fourth, the king or sovereign father; fifth, the parents of the common people. Cherishing the bond between master and disciple, aiding travelers at passes and fords, serving the king, and comforting and loving the orphaned and destitute—these are the five virtues.

The text elucidates this clearly; understanding comes naturally. Words are as spoken, not empty or false—true and real. All beings may know and learn this; contemplate it deeply, contemplate it deeply.

**Chapter Two: The Perfection of Hearing—Universal Spiritual Penetration**

One hears the chanting and singing of the highest perfected ones, the natural music of seven-jeweled palaces, the voices of the gods expounding the Dharma, the songs of dragons and phoenixes, the sound of divine winds scattering flowers, the disruptive chants of demon kings, the harmonious voices of jade maidens and immortal youths following the perfected ones, the spontaneous ringing of heavenly drums, the sounds of the assembled sages ascending to court, the melodies of the Five Emperors bestowing immortality, the voices of the Northern Emperor reviewing the registers of the dead, the Southern Dipper determining the records of life, the Central Dipper inscribing the registers of immortals, the distinctions of good and evil across the three realms, the judgments of Mount Tai’s net of sins, the music of the king’s palace, the clamor of armies training, the discussions of literary and strategic arts, the recitations of Daoist priests offering incense and making vows, the explanations of profound meanings, the teachings of young novices, the relief of illness and deliverance from distress, the voices of boys and girls, the words of spirits in mountains, forests, rivers, and seas—both good and evil—the recitations of recluses in secluded valleys deeply savoring the scriptures, the cries of hungry ghosts in hell begging for food in all directions, the wails of *wangliang* ghosts in hell enduring torture and torment, the laments of those conscripted by the Three Officials, longing for death but unable to die, the anguished cries of prisoners in earthly jails undergoing interrogation, the suffering calls of livestock slaughtered by humans, the sounds of birds, beasts, fish, and fowl devouring one another, the clamor of ghosts and spirits in conflict, the invocations of sacrifices to evil spirits, the sounds of drums, bells, and chimes, the noises of play, sorrowful weeping, and mourning, the complaints of the poor, the groans of the sick, the arrogance of the wealthy, the cries of victims of bandits and murder, the sounds of lust and sensual indulgence—such are the myriad sounds above and below heaven. All these one can hear and know without the ear becoming confused.

Rooted in the divine attainments gained through the cultivation of precepts—

**Chapter Three: The Universal Vision of the Eye’s Precept-Attained Divine Power**
One sees the palaces of the heavens where the Perfected Ones expound the Dao, the unmoving serenity of the lofty sages in the ten directions, the division of light by sun and moon, the harmony of gong and shang notes, the mutual generation of yin and yang, the roars of dragons and phoenixes, the flying immortals scattering blossoms, the Heavenly Worthy guiding in empty space, the grand Dao assemblies teaching and transforming the heavens, the deliverance of immortals and Perfected Ones across the Three Realms, the recording of names by the Five Emperors, the revelry of kings and ministers, the debates of Daoists expounding scriptures, the repentance and ritual pacing, the partings of life and death, the sorrowful weeping and mourning, the torment of suffering souls in hell, the agony of prisoners in earthly jails, the hunger and thirst with no food or drink, the mutual harm and devouring of birds, beasts, fish, and fowl, the slaughter and sacrifice to spirits, the falling of lustful blossoms, the falsehood of deceitful words, the slander and envy of hidden malice, the complaints of laziness and backsliding—all such moments above and below heaven one can see without the eye’s root becoming confused, for this is the divine power attained through the cultivation of precepts.

**Chapter Four: The Universal Olfaction of the Nose’s Precept-Attained Divine Power**
The natural fragrances of the heavens, the subtle and wondrous scent of *tuoluo*, the *shamoni* and *nilin* fragrances, the *botiman* blossom’s aroma, the wind-borne scent of the Secret River, the blue and white blossoms’ fragrance, the purple and red blossoms’ fragrance, the azure and yellow blossoms’ fragrance, the scent of yin clouds between the two earths, the golden-hued renowned incense, the fragrance of the forms of lofty Perfected Ones in the ten directions, the scent of the celestial maidens’ qi, the sandalwood and aloeswood incense, the cool and refreshing *qinggui* fragrance, the benzoin and sparrow-head incense, the *ainao*, *xuansuan*, and garlic scents, the *chongpi* and *kundang* aromas, the frankincense and benzoin, the *zhicao* and bright orchid fragrance, the fine medicinal waters’ scent, the blossoms and true forms of animals, the scent of human heads and bird feathers, the fragrance of boys and girls, the *maoxian* and *keyue* aromas, the soft and tender breath—all such fragrances above and below heaven one can smell and know without the nose’s root becoming confused, for this is the divine power attained through the cultivation of precepts.

**Chapter Five: The Universal Discernment of the Mouth’s Precept-Attained Divine Power**
The sweet and numinous flavors of the heavens, the taste of swallowing sunlight and consuming blossoms, the savor of drawing in moonlight and dining on essence, the flavor of feeding on non-sucking light, the *luosheng* and darkly radiant taste, the green waters and yellow essence flavor, the fine herbs and sweet leeks’ savor, the jade seal and penetrating mystery taste, the wind-borne jade and stone flavor, the pine and cypress’ sweetness, the unborn and life-pervading aroma—all such flavors above and below heaven one can savor and know without the mouth’s root becoming confused, for this is the divine power attained through the cultivation of precepts.

**Chapter Six: The Universal Strength of the Hand’s Precept-Attained Divine Power**
The hand does not take yet is self-sufficient, does not move yet is self-abundant, does not sway yet is self-plentiful, does not shift yet is self-level, does not exert yet is self-powered, does not grasp yet brings itself, does not clench yet lifts itself, does not hold yet fills itself, equal to the divine hand—all this is the divine power attained through the cultivation of precepts.

**Chapter Seven: The Wondrous Pervasiveness of the Mind’s Precept-Attained Divine Power**
The mind can encompass the Three Realms, can move the Great Void, can command demonic spirits, can subdue all essences, can become palaces, can become yin and yang, can guide the sun and moon, can play in Dao assemblies, can wander among the lofty Perfected Ones, can become radiant blossoms, can enter the subtle and minute, can become great forms, can become water and fire, can become wind and earth, can aid heaven and earth, can rescue hell, can transcend all afflictions, can dissolve all forms, can merge with the myriad things—all such things it can do without the mind’s root becoming confused, for this is the divine power attained through the cultivation of precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy said: This is the body composed of the Four Great Elements, which, by aligning with the Dao and cultivating precepts, gains universal divine powers in this present life. Though one has not yet realized the true Dao, one attains spiritual feet. Proceeding from here in study, one gradually enters the subtle and wondrous. From one to three, the time of fruition draws near—this is the Way of enduring vision. Though far from the Three Evils, one is free from all sorrow, affliction, and poison. When the six roots are perfected, they merge with the One Spirit, and together they soar to the Upper Clarity.

Sowing one, reaping ten thousand, like the harvest of rice in the fields, one must exert oneself diligently. Do not give rise to doubt, lest you lose your karmic conditions, fall into the long night, and cycle endlessly through the Five Paths—this awakening is difficult to measure.

**The Ninth Chapter: The Grades of Karmic Rewards for Merit in Past Kalpas**
The Heavenly Worthy said: In past kalpas, those sentient beings who:
- studied the supreme Dao,
- made offerings to the Three Treasures,

- ingested essence and swallowed qi,
- practiced ingestion and guiding exercises,
- presented jade tablets at the Eight Nodal Festivals to the Five Marchmounts and Three Rivers,
- offered clothing to Dharma masters,
- encouraged and assisted those lacking fragrant fats and other necessities,

**Chapter Ten: The Parable of Virtue’s Shelter**

The Heavenly Worthy said:
I am the father and mother of all beings, cherishing and loving you, showing compassion to all, sheltering and nurturing all, moistening and nourishing all. All things that attain me are like fish finding the deep pool, like a child finding its mother, like the hungry finding food, like the thirsty finding drink, like the sick finding a physician, like the people finding their king, like the fearful finding refuge, like the drowning finding a boat, like the poor finding treasure, like the condemned receiving pardon, like the dying being revived, like the ruined being restored. My Dharma universally delivers beings, like a great cloud filling the sky, scattering fine rain in dense layers—none fail to receive its moisture.

Beings do not know me, yet I give you life, raise you, nourish you, rear you, pity you. Why do you not repay my kindness with compassion and perform all good deeds? Instead, seeing my scriptures and Dharma, you do not repent or establish karmic conditions, hastening toward evil destinies, sinking into hell—how grievous, how lamentable! Each of you must diligently cultivate to uproot the seeds of sin and reap the fruits of eternal joy, as I have expounded in my teachings.

**Chapter Eleven: The Retribution of Beings’ Past Karmic Conditions for Receiving Unwholesome Rewards**

Those who in past lives resented others’ gains and losses now receive the retribution of being constantly slandered.
Those who in past lives mocked the poor now receive the retribution of enduring this very distress.
Those who in past lives stole, robbed, or, being wealthy and powerful, deceived and exploited the poor and lowly, or borrowed without repayment, now receive the retribution of being reborn as oxen, constantly bearing heavy burdens, thinking only of water and grass.

Those who in past lives envied others’ intelligence now receive the retribution of stupidity and ignorance.
Those who in past lives wore shoes while entering quiet halls and temples now receive the retribution of broken legs, being confined without ease, or having difficulty walking.
Those who in past lives secretly entered others’ homes at night to commit adultery or theft now receive the retribution of being eyeless or hating the blind.
Those who in past lives, dwelling in wealth, ate alone, refused to lend, ignored those in peril, lacked benevolence and righteousness, and scorned the poor and lowly, now receive the retribution of being born in barbarian lands among non-human beings.

Those who in past lives made offerings to ghosts and spirits now receive the retribution of constant insufficiency, drifting in degradation through the world.
Those who in past lives cursed and reviled others now receive the retribution of being constantly cursed and hated, or being reborn as dogs.
Those who in past lives drank wine without restraint, exceeding limits and committing evil, now receive the retribution of having their nature and reason inverted.

Those who in past lives were unkind to their brothers, wives, and children now receive the retribution of having disharmonious families, constantly quarreling, and being scorned by others.
Those who in past lives wished others to be their slaves now receive the retribution of becoming slaves.

Such karmic conditions are manifold; here I have briefly recounted some to awaken your understanding. Beings, do not harbor such wishes or perform such deeds. The retribution of good and evil is certain and must be believed.

If there were no such karmic conditions, all would be born human, sharing the same four great elements—yet why do differences arise in wisdom and foolishness? Why do disparities exist in talent and incompetence? Why do distinctions appear in nobility and poverty? Why do variations occur in brightness and dullness? Why do some possess complete faculties while others do not? Why do some engage in discourse and debate while others do not? Why are some respected and loved while others are not? Why are some honored and revered while others are not? Such matters have been briefly recounted here.

**Chapter Twelve: The Rewards of Beings’ Karmic Deeds for Receiving Wholesome Retribution**

Wealth in this world arises from past-life almsgiving;
Kingship in this world arises from past-life offerings to the Three Treasures;
Becoming a Dharma Master, skilled in guidance and transformation, arises from past-life contemplation of the Great Vehicle;
Wisdom and intelligence in this world arise from past-life reverence for and faith in scriptural learning;
Being respected and feared by others arises from past-life vigilance in upholding the Three Treasures;
Abundance in clothing and food arises from past-life relief of the destitute;
High rank in officialdom and prominence in noble households arise from past-life restraint from harming living beings;
The perfection of the six senses arises from past-life protection of the Three Treasures;
Flawless speech and discourse arise from past-life expounding of the Great Vehicle’s teachings;
Being a refuge for all people arises from past-life compassion and relief of all beings;
Being yielded to by good companions and deferred to by others arises from past-life wishing others to succeed in goodness.

Such are these retributions. Here, their principles are briefly stated. The karmic conditions are manifold; the roots of good and evil bear fruit like the radiance of the sun and moon, like the surging of the great ocean’s waves, like the turning of the four seasons, like the shifting of the Five Phases, like the wheel of a chariot. Do you, all beings, know this? Do you awaken to it? Do you comprehend it? Do you understand it? Do you practice it? Do you believe it? Do you take heed? Can you receive it? Now I have made clear these matters of good and evil.

All in the great assembly rejoiced, paid homage, and praised the teaching, wishing to fully comprehend it.

The Venerable One of Limitless Origin said: “The essential matters spoken by the Heavenly Worthy are most wondrous, sufficient to turn the minds of all beings. Among them are countless categories, yet beings cannot fully grasp them. Only the Dao can be understood with the Dao; only the Real can be understood with the Real; only the Void can be understood with the Void.

After kalpas of receiving my title, I shall become the Limitless Heavenly Master, guiding the Great Vehicle of the Most High. Reflecting on these words now, many in this great assembly have yet to awaken to this truth.

The kalpa-body of the Heavenly Worthy is like the palaces of the Sun Valley, with its Terrace of Water Spirits, eighty myriad leagues in circumference and equal in height. Within it is golden sand, each grain like a mustard seed, filling it entirely. One grain dissolves every ten thousand years—such is the duration of the Heavenly Worthy’s minor kalpa-body. It is also like the dust into which all mountains, hills, mounds, earth, forests, and trees of the one hundred eighty Kunlun realms under the three myriad eight thousand worlds to the north are ground, then scattered into the great void. Their number is like the Heavenly Worthy’s body. When a great kalpa has passed, beings still do not awaken, do not believe. Among the four assemblies, those of the Lesser Vehicle, those of minor kalpa-bodies, the deva-princes, deva-kings, and deva-emperors also do not know or hear of it. Now that it is spoken, they too harbor doubts—how much more so the beings of this defiled world, who give rise to confusion! Thus, it is explained so that it may be made clear.

Belief is difficult; knowledge is difficult; awakening is difficult; reception is difficult; encounter is difficult; seeing is difficult; devotion is difficult—such is the difficulty of my own body. As your guide, I deem it difficult, yet in truth, there is no difficulty.

The Venerable One of Limitless Origin said: “The *Five Thousand Characters* are the spirits within the five bodies of the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Radiance Treasure Repository. These spirits were also commanded by Laozi as the *Five Hundred*. Laozi compiled this meaning: the Numinous is the father of all beings; the Treasure is the mother of all beings; the Radiance is the light of the sun, illuminating and nourishing all; the Repository contains and generates the myriad things within it. I too have traversed this path.

The Heavenly Worthy surveys the good and evil, the learned and unlearned, among all beings—human and non-human, one-footed, two-footed, four-footed, many-footed, born of filth, moisture, eggs, wombs, or transformation—across the myriad worlds within a thousand koṭi Sumerus. All such evils arise before his eyes, mere inches from his body. Yet beings claim they do not know or see, do not recognize their true father and mother. Some say the true sages are distant; some say there are no divine spirits. Those who honor their parents receive descending numinous qi; those who dishonor their parents incur calamitous punishment. The parents of womb-born beings are but temporary vessels for karmic conditions—who can truly understand this?

Studying the Great Vehicle is the condition, yet merely wishing for birth is not the ultimate aspiration of those who attain the Dao. If their merit and virtue are insufficient, they must again revolve through rebirth, yet their karmic roots of blessings remain unbroken. In later lives, they are constantly born into nobility, wealth, and honor, their virtue revered, their features complete, their actions guided by good spirits. They encounter enlightened teachers, auspicious burial sites, virtuous wives, and abundant provisions; malevolent spirits dare not approach.

Those who take no joy in forming karmic bonds with the Three Treasures, who do not believe in the words of the sages, who utter harsh and abusive speech, and commit unwholesome deeds, are constantly born into lowly stations. They encounter unenlightened teachers, inauspicious burial sites, coarse wives, and lose their wealth upon departure. They become entangled with officials, their endeavors fail, good spirits do not protect them, and malevolent spirits lead them astray. All this arises from past-life karmic conditions, each governed by its respective stellar deity. The good belong to good stars; the evil belong to evil stars. Birth and death have their counterparts—this is exceedingly clear. Without the deliverance of the Great Vehicle, none can escape.

Do you, all beings, know this? Yet you revere and trust heterodox teachings and various scriptures—how deeply pitiable is this delusion!

There are one hundred ninety-eight kinds of Dao, all of which are the Heavenly Worthy’s body. Why is this so? Among the beings of the ten directions’ worlds, their minds and actions differ. Some do not believe in spirits and ghosts, so the evil are transformed through evil expedient means, while the good are exhorted to awaken. Following their original minds, they are gradually led to know the Dao and truly awaken to the supreme path.”

To practice the Orthodox Unity (Zhengyi), there is no inside nor outside, no surface nor core, no essence nor grossness, neither two nor three, neither ten nor a hundred. Seek it through practice, and seek it from the heart—its principles of obscurity and clarity are exceedingly subtle and wondrous.

All beings, whether they see or do not see, must ever act as though they see; whether they fear or do not fear, must ever act as though they fear; whether they are cautious or not, must ever act as though they are cautious; whether they practice or not, must ever act as though they practice; whether they receive or not, must ever act as though they receive; whether they love or not, must ever act as though they love; whether they cultivate or not, must ever act as though they cultivate. Thus must the three hundred and sixty agreements be upheld. Whether it is real or not real, whether it is one or not one—this is what I have made clear.

This scripture issued from the golden mouth of the Heavenly Worthy. It must not be lightly slandered; to do so invites calamity and punishment, while reverence brings blessing and forgiveness. If there are those who aspire to be children of the Great Vehicle, they must devote themselves to its veneration, make offerings, recite and study it, and ponder its meaning deeply. Thus may they dissolve the sins of this present life, eradicate the evil of past causes, release the misfortunes of nine generations of ancestors, and deliver all from suffering.

Those who seek the Dao in the future must first purify and rectify their spirit. Then will ghosts and spirits protect them, and demon kings pay them homage. They must present gold and treasures, pledge their hearts, and maintain a thousand-day fast before the scripture is bestowed upon them.

The Perpetually Primordial Realized One said: “I receive the formless and the qi of the myriad things’ breath. The beginning is the coalescence of the myriad things’ essence and qi—this is the principle of life and death, and it is my body.”

It has one name: Dragon’s Tooth Mountain; two names: Dragon’s Body; three names: Dragon’s Liver; four names: Phoenix Cry; five names: Lion’s Head; six names: Lesser Kalpa; seven names: Eternal Abode; eight names: Present Manifestation; nine names: Future Advent; ten names: Past Occurrence. This mountain spans eight thousand billion myriad *li* in circumference. Beneath its kalavinka trees, the area extends four hundred billion myriad *li*. Once every kalpa, the Supreme Sages and Lofty Perfected descend upon this mountain to expound the Great Vehicle scriptures and gather the great assembly.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy discoursed in manifold ways, and each being understood according to their own capacity. Awakening to the varieties of his teachings, none erred—even the kings of moths and butterflies all attained the same understanding. The mountain arose thus: its altar was of yellow gold, its steps of white silver, its trees of the seven treasures, its blossoms of auspicious clouds. Dragons, phoenixes, and celestial beasts dwelt there, though among the assembly were those who had never before encountered such wonders.

The Heavenly Worthy, in his great compassion, revealed the mountain’s form, for it was tied to the causes of their former lives. All who study must diligently cultivate the Great Vehicle Dharma, for only afterward may they gather upon this mountain. The mountain also possesses palaces of the seven treasures and spontaneous celestial music. In that land, there is no spring, autumn, winter, or summer—yin and yang, the seasons, exist naturally and eternally.

The Great Vehicle scripture is but one, yet it branches into a thousand billion myriad forms—so vast that dragon-drawn chariots could not bear its weight, nor the Eastern Well measure its depth.

The first is the Five Thousand Characters. It is emptiness, it is void, it is non-being, it is being, it is heaven, it is earth, it is the myriad things. The Eternally Abiding Lofty Perfected of the ten directions ceaselessly contemplate it without surfeit.

Its single character is the Heavenly Worthy’s esoteric name, ever revealed in the world, yet beings fail to awaken to it. Even in later ages, those who attain the Dao’s fruit, as well as the worthy, sagely, wise, and learned scholars who ponder this meaning—though they may treat it as the empty discourse of external teachings—still do good thereby.

This scripture is the body of the Great Sage. Internally, it draws in the numinous qi; externally, it unfolds wondrous meanings—none can fathom its depths. In past kalpas, all beings who pondered this truth believed in its words, and their intentions were thus dissolved. Whether their speech accorded with principle or not, whether they attained or failed to attain, whether they understood the path or not—I too can receive it all, without reproaching others. I follow the hearts of the people, for it is said: “Take the people’s heart as one’s own heart.”

The Perpetually Primordial Realized One said: “The Daoist methods for governing the body are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—none can master them all. One need only grasp the One.”

Ingesting talismans, guiding and pulling, exhaling and inhaling, concealing and hiding—without completing the prior practices, one cannot succeed. Instead, one should diligently make offerings to this scripture, prostrate in worship, make vows, recite and study it, cultivate sincere faith without doubt, laziness, or weariness, and renew one’s resolve daily. Thus may one attain the power to soar and ride the dragon chariot, with nine generations of ancestors ascending together. Reflect well upon this: this scripture is the Five Thousand Characters.

The Primordial Commencement Realized One diligently studied and praised it, saying:

Wondrous is the supreme Dao,
The true Five Thousand Characters.
Empty and without origin, without trace,
Yet traces scatter like mist and clouds.
Scattered, they are beyond thought or measure—
The Three and the One unite in the Lord Emperor.
The Three Vehicles are not two,
The August Void expounds and proclaims.
Beings are full of doubt,
Yet through preaching, awakening is transmitted.
Sever the roots of evil karma,
Depart from the troubles of old age and sickness.
Attain long life and enduring vision,
Fruits and deeds ride the rosy clouds.
Roam freely in the Great Void,
The lofty and sagely join the assembly.
For kalpas as countless as the morning,
There is no sorrow, no affliction, no enmity.
Look back upon later students—
Lazy and half-hearted in faith,
Leveling resentments and envy,
How can they ascend the same chariot?
Sinking into the nine nights below,
Their souls endure trials and torments.
Revolving through the Three Paths,
They will never again hear of good causes.

The Perfected of Primordial Beginning spoke:
In former kalpas, those who studied the Way of celestial immortality and the arts of deathlessness did not dwell in the world. To dwell in the world is to entertain many thoughts; many thoughts breed care; care burdens the heart; a burdened heart forgets the Dao. With wife and children, one worries for wife and children; with wealth and treasures, one worries for wealth and treasures; with illness, one worries for illness; with death and mourning, one worries for death and mourning; with poverty, one worries for poverty. All who follow such ways—how can they escape the pain of death? They diverge from the path of long life.

Only those who possess a single body know no care; knowing no care, the Dao and its methods endure forever. Later generations, deluded in their learning, only know to cherish their bodily lives, unaware of preserving and nurturing their spirit. The form is but a dwelling of the Four Great Elements—how can a dwelling last forever? When the person departs, the dwelling collapses, and the spirit scatters. Yet the spirit revolves without ceasing, neither sinking nor perishing.

Fools lavishly prepare grand tombs and fine timber, slaughtering living beings for burial rites, believing this to be filial piety and compassion. They do not realize they will face the long night of reckoning—how deluded, how deluded! They do not wish to become guests of the Most High, but hasten to be kings or common folk—this is true suffering.

When sages have disciples, they are not truly their disciples, but rather those upon whom past blessings have bestowed their sacred lineage. Sages have no fixed lineage of learners; what matters is that they comprehend fully, as if understanding were itself comprehension.

In former kalpas, when their merit was not yet complete, those who studied the highest Dao and the ranks of immortality had not yet fulfilled their destined transformation. Their bodies passed through the Great Yin, and their disciples, along with Dharma masters, close friends, and kin, would perform the Three Sevens retreat, recite the Five Thousand Characters ten times, and liberate their souls and spirits.

Those who study the highest Dao seek swift ascent through the revolving wheel; they need not possess long years of life. Unlike the foolish worldly folk who cling to long life without awakening, they, once unawakened, will weep. Weeping reveals the sickness of the body—how lamentable! Worldly people, by nature, face success and failure, long and short lives, and thus weep.

The Three Sevens retreat serves thus: the first seven days, the Water Official absolves sins; the second seven, the Earth Official resolves transgressions; the third seven, the Three Realms deliver beings, freeing them from the sufferings of hell, sparing them further reckoning, and hastening their transformation. Completing the full twenty-one days of the retreat is best; if not, observing the appointed days is also good. Diligence in the six periods of the day and night surpasses even the merit of saving lives.

All offerings made in faith, dedicated to the Three Treasures and the Dharma masters, should be thoughtfully considered—this is most wondrous. Yet all these are the delusions of later generations, who in life do not know to do good and establish fields of merit, but at death bury their clothing, treasures, and precious goods in coffins and tombs, only increasing the burdens and afflictions of the deceased. They do not understand that such acts are meant to deliver the dead and smooth their passage.

For the living, one set of garments for winter and summer suffices; there is no need for prolonged mourning that forgets the true needs of beings. Reflect deeply upon my words.

The Perfected of Primordial Beginning spoke:
In the ages to come, the minds of beings will grow coarse and wicked, failing to awaken to good causes. Unlike those of simple and honest nature today, future wise and worthy ones will teach the principles of ritual and doctrine. They will expound the truths of karmic conditions, the bonds of parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, sisters, and the six relations, and the rites of mourning—these are practices for all worldly people, not for those who study the highest Dao.

When parents or those below pass away, one should cultivate a mind of merit, wishing to be reborn together with their true parents in the future, free from life and death, without the need for ancestral rites. Such mourning only harms the heart of the Way. This is called "the disorderly verse"—ponder it well.

The Perfected of Primordial Beginning spoke:
Later learners must above all avoid unwarranted greed, obstructing others’ principles to enrich themselves, incurring resentment and invoking the wrath of spirits and gods. Though they may receive scriptures, wear talismans, practice breath control, observe fasts, cultivate the Dao, take elixirs, and regulate their diet, they merely exhaust their bodies outwardly. No immortality will be attained; instead, they hasten their trials. Coarse affairs cannot be extravagant—those who cling to such ways in their study are said to "seek competition in the world," not true realization.

If one is slain by evil spirits in this life without awareness, at death the spirit will sink into hell, facing reckoning. How difficult to recognize my words! Let the learner’s mind enter the realm of insects and ants with harmony, the realm of the six livestock with harmony, the realm of birds and beasts with harmony, the realm of spirits and gods with harmony, the realm of good and evil people with harmony, the realm of forests and trees with harmony, and all things with harmony. Let all beings share in goodness, without the slightest thought of harm or blame. Only thus will one be protected by spirits and gods, commended by the Three Realms, and naturally attain perfection.

The Perfected of Primordial Beginning spoke:
The Heavenly Worthy and I observe the unseen, the past, and the present as clearly as if they were in our hearts.

Then the Heavenly Worthy emitted from the center of his forehead the radiance of his purple-tinged brow, illuminating the ten directions, the thousand millions of Kunlun, and the three thousand six hundred great thousand worlds. All beings within beheld it with perfect clarity. The light was golden, and within it resounded a hundred thousand kinds of voices, delightful to hear. Following the light, beings unknowingly arrived beneath the Kalpa Flower Tree, where all good was attained, and they heard the roots of the Dharma’s karmic conditions expounded. This was the Heavenly Worthy’s demonstration of his great majestic power—a single encounter in a kalpa. Let later learners take heed and cultivate themselves well.

The Heavenly Worthy possesses great majestic power, striving to save all beings. Thus, within the Three Realms, though formless, there is a great voice; though formless, there is great strength—unattainable, like the sun, moon, and stars in the void, abiding mysteriously without attachment. From this arises spontaneity, and the turning of the human body is likewise.

Thus does qi communicate with numinous power. When a person preserves the Real, the Real preserves the person; when a person reveres the gods, the gods revere the person; when a person cherishes the spirits, the spirits cherish the person. When a person forgets qi, qi forgets the person; when a person neglects the Dao, the Dao neglects the person. Hence it is said: those with good karmic conditions proceed from brightness into brightness, from vision into vision, from understanding into understanding, from joy into joy. Those without good karmic conditions merely pass from error into error, from darkness into darkness, from suffering into suffering. Such are the correspondences—this is the root of all beings. In future kalpas, those who can believe and practice, who can uphold and cultivate, who can do good and be diligent, are the Dharma-teachers who, skillfully expounding my words, serve as guides, exhorting all to enter the Dharma-gate, perform purificatory fasts, recite scriptures, repent transgressions, and pray for deliverance, thereby loosening the bonds of birth and death. The rituals and precepts are manifold; one must rely on the detailed practices compiled by later sages.

Establishing merit and making vows proceeds from one to ten, from a hundred to a thousand, from a thousand to ten thousand. Gather silks and treasures to offer to the fast-officiant, dividing them into three portions: one portion for the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure, one portion for the Perfected and Most High Saints, and one portion for those with good karmic conditions. The principle of karmic retribution is likewise as it is with being and non-being—within being and non-being lies the Real; proceed from this.

The Realized One speaks of three portions: one offered to the fast-officiant, one offered to the Dharma-teacher, and one offered annually or triennially to the master who transmits the precepts, the ancestral master. If the two masters are no longer present, the offering is entrusted to the registrar-master, transmitted according to the laws of the Three Heavens—thus is it done.

The title of Realized One has its standards, yet the supreme Dao remains distant. Those who attain spiritual penetration and freedom no longer regress; though they command ghosts and employ spirits, they still engage in activity. Diligently performing great deeds, they traverse kalpas and enter subtlety, gradually approaching the supreme Dao. All such cases are comparable. Those who studied the Dao in past kalpas and became Realized did not attain it suddenly. Rarely born with karmic conditions, they remain bound to the hidden and obscure, naturally unforgetting. Should they grow lax, they are tested and fall back, then sink once more into the Five Paths, with no time for return.

Understand my words clearly. I have received the Heavenly Worthy’s command: in future kalpas, I shall be the parent of all beings, teaching the conditions for their growth and guiding those who shun evil. Heed my words well. In the kalpa when the Dao’s dispensation unfolds, only the Heavenly Master appears—this is singular. It is not that sages produce sages; scriptures and precepts have no distinction of great or small, no order of before or after, no hierarchy of high or low. They are all one. Yet there are ranks and categories, named according to their grade and volume. Each sage acts for the sake of beings.

It is neither two nor three, but identical to my own body. Let learners skillfully comprehend this. The ancient statutes of the Mystery Metropolis: thirty-one scrolls of the Jade Purity, thirty-six scrolls of the Purple Tenuity, three scrolls of the Great Ultimate. Their ranks and divisions each have their covenants, and these covenants serve as the body’s treasure, preserving one’s qi.

Death arises from within, not from without. Once it emerges from within, there is a response without, and this response brings great calamity. If within one remains unshaken and unradiant, abiding serenely in spirit, it is called "silent spirit, spirit abiding of itself." Thus it is said: those who study the higher learning practice non-action, and through non-action, qi is governed. Those who study the lower learning engage in action, and through action, body and mind labor together. When both labor together, the bonds of past karma unravel, gradually leading to the governance of qi. It is not through silent spirit alone. When transgressions are extinguished, the spirit naturally becomes tranquil; when the spirit is tranquil, longevity is attained. If merit remains unfulfilled, silent spirit is not established. One must labor the body and afflict the flesh, aiding and delivering all beings without wearying of hardship.

When a king faces calamity, recite this scripture. When the sovereign father is unwell, recite this scripture.

When pestilence and poison spread, recite this scripture. When the people suffer death and illness, recite this scripture. When sun and moon lose their brightness, recite this scripture. When stars and constellations deviate from their courses, recite this scripture. When the kalpa nears its end, recite this scripture. When wind and rain come unseasonably, recite this scripture. When teachers and friends fall ill, recite this scripture. When household and family perish, recite this scripture. When the five grains do not ripen, recite this scripture. When thieves and bandits abound, recite this scripture. When beings curse one another, recite this scripture. When learning declines and resolve weakens, recite this scripture. When scolding, slander, and wrath arise, recite this scripture. On the fast days of the devas, recite this scripture.

In performing the fast and reciting the scripture, let the voice resound through the Great Void. When the sound rises, it descends as Brahma-tones. The Brahma-tones are subtle and wondrous, moving the response of all sages. The Demon Kings pay reverence, and all Perfected Ones praise its goodness. With such merit, one’s virtue becomes equal to that of the Heavenly Perfected, gradually entering the divine samādhi.

Within the body, the thirty-two marks naturally become complete: hair grows dark and long, the nape radiates purple light, eyebrows take the shape of the crescent moon, ears hear the profound, eyes shine with clarity, the nose is cool and dry, the mouth is square and round, teeth are moist and firm, white as silver and pure, numbering forty, even and fine, the tongue is bathed in spring waters, drawing in the essence of the moon, the Palace of Saliva flows with celestial fluid, the throat is lofty, the spine strong and firm, hands are soft yet grasp firmly, embracing both inner and outer, feet are powerful, treading the mysterious void, the heart is upright and at peace, subduing the Demon Kings, the liver shines with brightness, entering Mount Tai, the lungs are pure in qi, dwelling in Huayin, the kidneys radiate strength, gazing upon Mount Heng, the spleen receives qi, embracing the loftiness of Mount Song, the gallbladder roars with mighty voice, shaking the numinous resonance, recitation penetrates the subtle, entering the unobstructed. All these are attained through study, not by nature.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Perfected of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure on Questioning Illness* concludes.
