**Title: *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear – A Collection***

**Preface to *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear***

The Master of Dan yang was of the lineage of Fu feng, a kinsman of the great scholar Ma Dabian. His family wealth was vast, and his descendants were distinguished. From his youth, he studied Confucianism, yet never feigned merit for gain, and his nature was inclined toward quietude and contentment, delighting in emptiness and nothingness.

He once told his associates: *"I met a strange man in a dream, and through his laughter, I attained enlightenment."*

In the autumn of the year Ding hai, during the reign of Emperor Da Zheng (大定), the Chongyang True Person (重陽真人) departed from Zhongnan Mountain (終南), traveled to the Sea Islands (海島), and sought to gather kindred spirits to journey together to Penglai (蓬萊), fulfilling the vow to pay homage to the Original Master (本師). Arriving in the east at Ninghai (寧海), he first visited the *Hall of the Immortal’s Encounter* (遇仙亭) of Fan Ming shu (范明叔). Master Dan yang followed and paid his respects to the True Person, and upon their first meeting, he was deeply moved.

*"In the past, I once glimpsed the Dao through a fleeting encounter—now I see that you, Master Dan yang, have long been destined for the Way."* Recognizing his innate affinity with the Dao, the True Person earnestly urged him to study the Way and cultivate True Nature (修真).

Master Dan yang, humbled by his guidance, respectfully invited the True Person to dwell in his county’s southern hermitage (南庵), which he named *Complete Perfection* (全真). Day and night, they expounded the Dao within. The True Person wished for Master Dan yang and his wife to swiftly abandon worldly attachments, forsake their native land, and become wandering *cloud-water* (雲水) practitioners. Initially, they were reluctant to comply.

The True Person then swore to refine the hermitage over a hundred days, beginning on the first auspicious day of the second month of winter (孟冬初吉), and bestowed upon him a whole pear (浑梨), commanding him to consume it. Every ten days, he would request another pear, which the True Person divided and sent to him and his wife, gradually increasing from two pieces to fifty-five. Every five days, he also received six each of yams and chestnuts (芋栗).

As the Chongyang True Person appeared in his dreams, warning him of the ten grave offenses leading to hellish retribution or celestial blessings, he composed verses—sometimes in praise, sometimes veiled with deeper meaning—to accompany each gift. Master Dan yang responded in kind, his poems revealing the profound interplay of *yin-yang* (陰陽) and the cosmic balance of odd and even numbers, as well as the mechanics of fate, virtue, and the cycles of life and death.

Thus, he abandoned worldly entanglements, altered his attire, burned his oath of secular life, and both he and his wife devoted themselves to the True Person as disciples.

By the year Ji chou (己丑), he accompanied the Chongyang True Person on his return journey to Liang (梁) and Bian (汴). After spending a year there, the True Person ascended to immortality. Master Dan yang then transmitted his teachings and, with his disciples, traveled westward to Zhongnan Mountain, seeking the True Person’s former retreat. He constructed a modest dwelling there and resided for ten years, expounding his doctrine. His disciples gathered in multitudes, beyond count.

In the year Ren yin (壬寅), Master Dan yang returned home with his staff (飛錫束來), once again visiting his native lands. One day, he spoke to his assembled disciples: *"The Chongyang True Person, in his lifetime, already composed *The Complete Perfection Collection: Before and After* (全真前後集). Additionally, during his sojourn in our region, he wrote many works on profound metaphysical discourse and wondrous principles, totaling over three hundred pieces, which I have compiled into three sections: the first titled *The Late Awakening* (下手遲), the middle *The Ten Transformations of Divided Pear* (分梨十化), and the final *The Reluctance to Leave Home* (好離鄉). Though this collection has been printed in the west, few copies have reached our lands. My disciples have urged me to revise and annotate these works, organizing them into three volumes, and commissioning artisans to carve them onto wooden blocks for wider dissemination."*

Jingzhenzi Zhu Baoyi (靈眞子朱抱一), one of Master Dan yang’s disciples, brought this collection to me and requested a preface. I replied: *"I am but a humble scholar, still laboring over my studies to advance my career. How could I dare to follow in the footsteps of the great masters, let alone claim detachment from fame and worldly concerns? Yet, even as a child, I knew of Master Dan yang’s reverence for the Dao, and I have witnessed firsthand the Chongyang True Person’s extraordinary efforts in refining the hermitage and guiding others. Though my understanding is shallow, I cannot refuse."*

Thus, I retained *The Ten Transformations of Divided Pear* (分梨十化) alone. I hope this may inspire practitioners of the Way across the land, spreading the profound benefits of Complete Perfection (全真) teachings far and wide.

As for the Chongyang True Person’s exhortations, divine signs, and other records, prefaces, songs, and poems—these are already well-documented. Here, I merely recount the origins of Master Dan yang and his wife’s entrance into the Dao.

This preface was written in the year Gui mao (癸卯) of the Da Zheng reign (大定), at the request of the scholar-official Ma Dabian (馬大辨), a native of Dong Mou xiang (東牟鄉), Ninghai Prefecture (寧海州).

**Volume One of *The Ten Transformations of Chongyang’s Divided Pear*:**
Composed by Chongyang True Person Wang Zhen (重陽子王矗) of Zhongnan Mountain (終南山).

**Water Cloud Wanderer (水云游):**
Dwell yet, dwell yet—
In the tenth month’s small spring,
One must lock the door.
A hundred days—refine Chongyang’s essence,
No need for contrivance.
The whole body must reveal its true, unadorned nature.
Hang the paper of luminous clarity.
Trust in it—
As jade flies and gold walks,
One remains serene, unmindful.

---

**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**
Not dwell, not dwell—
The Fire Hall must be abandoned,
Deeply proper to part the doors.
The Harmful Wind Immortal
Transforms my bolted gate—
This practice must be done.
Abstain from meat’s defilement, ever eat of plainness.
Hang only hempen cloth upon the body.
Await the hundred mornings
When the lock’s key opens—
Emulate my teacher’s inward gaze.

---

**Ode to Dan Yang (赠丹阳绝句):**
Today’s Chongyang is the very time of Zhengyi.
How can one know the taste of the whole pear?
If one can drink the West River’s waters,
One will surely follow the *King’s Wind* closely.

---
**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳次韵):**
When the Harmful Wind Immortal locked me in Chongyang’s hall,
You granted me the pear’s taste—I know it well.
My heart has left home, wandering cloud and water,
The Dao reveals its secrets—dragons and tigers follow.

---

**Water Cloud Wanderer (水云游):**
Jade nature, jade nature—
Jade lock tightly sealed, golden gate firmly pinned.
In the jade chamber’s depth,
A hundred days of pure clarity,
Jade radiance shines all at once.
The jade spoon opens the path to the Immortals.
A decree from the Jade Gate.
When the Jade Boy arrives,
One is granted *Complete Perfection*—
The Jade Emperor’s proclamation is already set.

---
**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**
Jade nature, jade nature—
Jade door firmly sealed, golden gate tightly pinned.
Within the jade chamber,
A black dragon appears—
The jade tiger devours it all.
The jade pass can unlock the swift path.
The Jade Boy transmits the decree.
The Jade Emperor’s Heaven—
Arrived, without favor,
The jade edict is now decreed.

---

**Gift to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband (赠丹 Yang 夫妇):**
Only yam and chestnut for your two meals,
The Dao’s flavor should match this sweetness.
Six times six—just call it twelve,
The first three threes with the last three threes.

---
**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳次韵):**
Today’s yam and chestnut feast is joyful,
Its taste like nectar, sweet and pure.
Within, thirty-six perfections are complete—
Who in the world knows of the ten and three?

---

**Gift to Aunt Sun (赠孙姑):**
The second aunt still clings to her household affairs,
Yet who knows her wealth has crumbled to dust?
If she stays at home like the old days,
Master Ma will have no share in Immortality.

---
**Gift to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband (赠丹阳夫妇):**
Eleven parts divided—Ma the Scholar,
Must gently acknowledge the return to the head.
The three sufferings are arranged to release,
Two clods of earth will never guess.
Beneath the shed, cold words offer no livelihood,
On the tower, dark responses hide no fortune.
May you awaken and understand—do not call me,
For this is the teaching that guides the virtuous out.

---
**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**
The Harmful Wind Immortal, endowed with high talent,
Crafts verses that fish me back.
One nature is not allowed to be obscured by dust—
The Three Lights must be divined within.
After true-hearted enlightenment, self and others are forgotten,
When wisdom’s eye opens, wealth and color are abandoned.
Today, I know the taste of the separated child—
With fate, I brush aside my sleeves and do not return.

---
**Gift to Dan Yang (赠丹阳):**
A gourd on your back, brimming with wine to sell—
From nothingness comes having, from having nothing.
The pure light, smooth and spicy, is fully recognized—
Moon-wrapped jade forests will never wither.

---
**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳继韵):**
No need to sell nectar or jade elixir,
Sweetness on the tongue is never absent.
I’ve received the Harmful Wind’s irrigation method—
The spirit-sprouts and wisdom-grass will never wither.

---
**Gift to Dan Yang’s Wife and Husband: Yam and Chestnut (赠丹阳夫妇芋栗):**
Chestnut comes to see the yam,
The two share a meal beyond the heavy eaves.
Three threes yield three threes’ worth of flavor,
Six sixes must know six sixes’ path.
Wielding the sword, one can strike the body’s shadow,
With needle and thread, one can seize the water’s clod.
Even if you scheme a thousand ways,
How can you escape the barren hill’s dust?

---
**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳又韵):**
From now on, my face is filthy, my hair wild,
No memory of joyous songs in the wine hall.
Avoiding home’s karmic debts,
Chasing the outer world’s blessings.
Alas, my body is like a candle before the wind,
My fate like a clod upon the water.
Encountering *True Refining*, I awaken properly—
Lest my nature lie buried in the barren mound.

---
**Water Cloud Wanderer (水云游):**
Reflect, reflect—
This mortal frame of four illusions,
What use is its play?
Originally, it is a walking corpse with moving bones,
Yet it still boasts of its postures.
The luminous, wise nature shines truly brilliant.
This skeletal cage must be exchanged.
The Harmful Wind Child—
Without relying on the human body,
He consorts with the Immortals.

---
**Dan Yang’s Continuation (丹阳继韵):**
Reflect, reflect—
Wives, concubines, sons, and grandsons,
Do not come to mock with meals.
The white-walled kin of debt—
Strike the rope at their feet,
Sever them in one stroke.
The luminous source is now fully illuminated—
This exchange is complete.
Master Ma’s Wind Child—
Leaves his homeland behind,
Consorts with the Harmful Wind Immortal.

---
**Divided Pear Poem (分梨诗):**
Three clods of mud extinguish the master’s path,
Each person takes one or two bites.
Its flavor can dry the Northern Sea,
Its fragrance permeates the Western Lake.
Jade waves roll and surge,
Golden ripples spread densely.
Just as the text’s meaning is revealed,
All depends on the *zhe* and *hū*.

---
**Dan Yang’s Reply (丹阳继韵):**
Once encountered in the muddy path,
The harmonized taste is taken.
Dragon’s roar shakes the valleys,
Tiger’s howl pierces lake and river.
To forge the Golden Elixir,
One must lay down the Jade Seal.
This transforms all things—
How much more so for humans?

---
**Burning the Heart-Incense #1 (爇心香#1)**

「Burning the Heart-Incense #1»

---
**Sitting Slays the Wind of King, Standing Slays the Wind of Exhortation,**
Yet only because of *her*—
**She clings to the Wind of Home.**
Better to cast off fiercely,
And embrace the Pure Wind.

**To walk with the Wind, to sit with the Wind,**
Together grasp the Wind.
**I am the True Wind, you the Feigned Wind.**
The *Xiao Chun Tian*—
**All relies on the Warm Wind.**
When snow arrives,
**How can one endure the Cold Wind?**
Within the window,
Outside the door—
**Two kinds of Wind.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
This *Exhortation Wind*—
**She was nurtured in the Wind of Scholarship.**
When she met the Wind Immortal,
**She gained the Pure Wind.**
Though the Wind rages,
**She mocks the Residual Wind.**
This Wind, this Wind, this Wind—
**The Wind is utterly extinguished,**
Like the Heart Wind.

**To transcend the mundane, the Wind must be seized,**
**To depart the realm, the Wind must be gathered.**
Toward the *Xuan Guan*—
**To grasp the Cloud Wind.**
The Fragrant Wind ceases not,
**Delighting in my Pine Wind.**

**Await the Good Wind,**
**The Soul Wind comes,**
**Then swiftly ride the Wind.**

**With Dan Yang**
The *Yu Li* left the sage to wander no more,
**Why fret the heart in the mechanisms of fate?**
Ever pitying the household’s schemes as entangling bonds,
**How can one free the body to dwell in ease?**
One round of *Chen Qiu* rolls endlessly,
**Two balls of *Mao Shi* are most foolish and obstinate.**
If one understands the discourse of Pure Coolness,
**Perhaps they will dwell with me in the good mountains.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
**To seek escape from schemes, not to return—**
**To shatter the *Qi Cai* bonds of wine and desire.**
**To extinguish flames and disperse smoke, forever encountering joy,**
**To stand firm in the Dao, the heart at ease.**
**Must one succeed only after oneself?**
**How dare one rely on past softness and folly?**
**At base, a man depends on his resolve and *qi*,**
**To dwell forever in the Three Mountains.**

**True Leisure #2**
If one seeks to cultivate,
**Must first attend to the details.**
**Lock tight the Golden Pass, the Jade Gate.**
**Above and below, harmonize and refine,**
**Their positions interchanged, like *Xiao Ji* irrigation.**
**Once attained, the *Hou* and *Xing* are clear—**
**No longer guessing at riddles.**
**Roll into the void, then return to the root.**
**The radiance is pure,**
**The silver mist shimmers.**
**Five hues fresh and new,**
**Directly luminous, smooth, and refined.**
**Distinctly revealed—**
**Pure, clear, and tranquil in its subtlety.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
The *Yin Yang* *Qi* flows ceaselessly,
**Refined to the finest detail.**
**Toward the *Qiong Hu*, seal the head and close the vessel.**
**Before the *Zi Wu* palace,**
**Jade and gold circulate in aid.**
**This mystery—**
**Clear and distinct, no need for guessing.**
**Celestial seed,**
**Marine root.**
**The mist’s radiance spreads,**
**Dazzling without end.**
**Suddenly the True Form appears,**
**Like smooth jade.**
**The origin of transformation—**
**Cultivation lies in attending to the details.**

**With Dan Yang**
The Harmful Wind wanders through water, mist, and cloud,
**Six leaves revolving, bound by iron plates.**
**She strikes through the world, yet none perceive it,**
**Only the heart knows—this one alone hears.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
Within the *Bao Ping Gong*, observe the auspicious clouds,
**Clouds come and go, separating the false from the true.**
**The Heart Lute splits to form melodies,**
**High tones resound naturally.**

**With Dan Yang**
A single whole pear divided into four,
**Grandfather and grandmother share it—let none dispute.**
**The pear is not divided for separation’s sake,**
**The fruit’s growth depends on the *Jie Guo* text.**
**When waters surge, teach the tortoise and hare to drink,**
**When fire comes, do not burn the crimson heart.**
**If one harmonizes water and fire in reversal,**
**Cool detachment brings joy in its own hearing.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
Dividing the pear, she awakens to the Four Partings,
**Gradually sensing her heart’s ash, her nature no longer tumultuous.**
**Wonder upon wonder—even the tiger and dragon cannot explain,**
**Profound upon profound—how could gold and jade be of concern?**
**The celestial seed thrives best when watered in fire,**
**The enlightened grass endures when burned in water.**
**Only when the Great Elixir is complete, unbroken,**
**Will the True Consumption and True Breath arise naturally.**

**Divine Light #3**
The Golden Pass knocks at the door,
The Jade Lock bars the gate—
**No idle cultivation, no forced practice.**

**Silent and obscure, who can comprehend?**
**She toys with infants.**
**When asleep, she seizes the monkey and catches the horse,**
**When awake, she gathers the *Qiong Zhi*.**
**Each moment, this practice—**
**A hundred days, only the heart may know.**

**At ease and leisure, she attains perfection,**
**Only spreading—**
**The radiance of crimson mist.**
**She veils the luminous clarity,**
**Then reveals the originally existing True Mercy.**
**A single grain of Divine Elixir forms,**
**Three layers of flame cling tightly around it.**
**Past the *Yao Chi*,**
**Piercing the *Qing Xiao Ding*—**
**Effortless *Wu Wei*.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
The Wind Immortal locks the door,
Master Ma departs his nest—
**Quiet and serene, she holds herself aloof.**
**Having exhausted the roots and sources, why cling?**
**To the wife, to the children.**
**Recognizing the *Qi Cai* bonds of wine and desire,**
**She relies on purity to nurture the *Ling Zhi*.**
**Right now, in secret,**
**She completes the practice—**
**The cultivation’s fruits are not for others to know.**
**Hidden and concealed, she stores her brilliance,**
**Then must she—**
**Become a *Yu He* jade vessel, draped in silk.**
**She douses the ignorance of *Wu Ming*,**
**The flames and torches are the heart’s own mercy.**
**Enduring humiliation—what state does she attain?**
**The good sprouts grow,**
**Daoists and Buddhas follow constantly.**
**The profound mystery—**
**This true practice is indeed effortless.**

**With Dan Yang**
*Yu* and *Li*—
*Li* and *Yu*—
**Two flavors, do not let them be lost.**
**Nature and Life—**
**Life and Nature—**
**Two essences, entering and exiting, known by sages and worthies.**
**All must know,**
**All must know,**
**Then it is the time of eternal life, the fixed root.**
**Do not covet the *Yao Tai* or the *Lang Yuan*,**
**Six treasures emerge from the Heavenly Pool.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
The *Chong Yang* Immortal sets forth *Yu* and *Li*,
**Gifts to my husband and wife—do not lose them.**
**To know Life,**
**To know Nature—**
**From here, transcend the mundane and enter the sage.**
**The profound mystery—**
**To know the profound mystery—**
**The body’s *Zi Wu* reverses and overturns.**
**In the watery realm, the Golden Elixir forms without leakage,**
**Naturally ascending with cloud steps to the *Yao Chi*.**

**True Joy #4**
**She locks the door and secures the key,**
**Within, she harbors the most wondrous stratagem.**
**She sets the furnace, refines the Golden Essence,**
**Nurtures the Original Spirit, perfects the Elixir.**
**Two grains round and radiant,**
**Beyond the void, they revolve and circulate.**
**The five hues all support and sustain,**
**Yet there is no giving nor receiving.**
**Dark and distant, not seeking aid.**
**She seizes the fullness,**
**She meets the pledge.**
**The path to *Peng Lai*—**
**Forever bound in advance,**
**Established in eternal spring,**
**In the fragrant *Yao Fang*, the jade *Qiong E*.**
**She awaits the Pure Coolness’s light to pervade and illuminate,**
**Releasing the fragrant scent naturally.**
**She veils her face before the enlightened teacher,**
**Revealing True Joy and True Leisure.**

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
The bonds of wine, desire, *Qi Cai*, and wealth are far from the key,
**Her affairs are simple and her schemes few.**

**玉花洞#5**
To know the truth—
Silent, ponder deeply,
Rely on cause and effect.
Bring forth joy and delight,
Return to the Mysterious and Marvelous,
Then lock the gate.

Awakened and clear—truly worthy,
A natural fragrance burns.
In purity and stillness,
Distinctly, one—
The Master comes to see me.

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
Having met the True,
How dare I be negligent?
Diligently cultivate virtue and fruit.
Seize the wild horse of intent,
Lest it falter—
Then lock the mind-monkey away.
When demons and trials arise, all is well—
It is but dancing in smoke and fire.
The Original Teacher has revealed it:
This essence of the First—
What need for idle chatter of self and other?

**无梦令#6**
Now, with you, we light the lamp,
Recording in *Wu Meng Ling*:
Ancient Sage’s poem of Fu Chun,
Six white lights gleaming like jade.
*Ding Shu*, *Ding Shu*—
Each block, each person knows contentment.

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
Today the Master passes the lamp,
Worldly affairs unworthy of mention.
Farewell, Fu Chun maiden,
Each refining our own gold and jade.
*Ting Shu*, *Ting Shu*—
Clear, the True Thusness—wishes fulfilled.

**热心香（行香子）**
Nicknamed *Wang Feng*,
Yet truly a Daoist breeze.
Nature harmonizes with Zen,
Buddhist scriptures and Confucian winds.
Refined speech spills like jade,
Each stroke like wind.
Unraveling long scrolls,
Swinging short verses—
Ancient poetic winds.
Axes move like wind,
Peng soars, clutching wind.
At will, cloud-driving—
Riding the wind of *Yu Bu*.
In winter’s cold, doors shut,
Yet high winds seen in thought.
Sitting without stove,
Sleeping without blanket,
Enduring frost and wind.

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
The Daoist singer of *Wang Feng*,
Comes to transform *Fu Feng*.
Awakening devotion,
Particularly displaying the family wind.
Entering trance, lost in dreams,
Riding crane, borne by wind.
Wind-taking wind,
Wind’s trust—
Then follows the wind.
Seeking scenes, riding wind,
What need for Confucian winds?
Breaking free of bonds,
Feigning heart-wind.
Not lost in illusions,
Recognizing True Wind.
Seizing wind gusts,
Riding wind-horse,
Driving cloud-wind.

**#1** *"You await firm-hearted departure, I await firm-hearted vigilance.
The sweet chestnuts and fragrant taro—
Grandmother and I share the same feast.
Unfolding the flowers of all four seasons,
Opening the willows of three springs.
One nature, fully revealed—
*Yu Bu*’s elixir of immortality.*

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
*I dare not wander recklessly,
Yet I deeply thank the Master for his steadfast guidance.
This year’s taro and chestnuts—
Six meals of sweet delight.
No craving for the *East Mound* recluse,
No lingering love for spring’s willows.
Joining the Daoist Sage in transcendent play,
Together drinking the wine of eternal life.*

**Yellow River Clears**
*The roots are firm, the source pure—
Lock the door to guard its clarity.
Turn warmth upon you,
Banish all harsh cold and frost.
A different kind of elegance and refinement,
Instantly knowing how to transcend the *Guan Zhong*’s constraints.
Awakening to natural enlightenment,
Meeting immortality—
Now plucking the jade blossoms with ease.*

*From the beginning, the true spirit exists,
Brightly revealed—
This time, refining the *lead and mercury*.
Then let it coalesce,
A single grain of *golden elixir* ready to offer.
Manifesting auspicious radiance,
Further coming and going—
Following the *Luan* crane and guiding the *Feng* wind.
The Ten Realms and Three Islands,
The gods rejoice and welcome with shared celebration.*

**Dan Yang’s Continuation**
*The Master seals the door with unwavering devotion,
Not to aid the *fixed* or *crossing* of clouds.*
*Nor is it boasting—
To endure the hunger of three winters.*
*For my stubborn, worldly heart,
He uses skill to transform profound speech into understanding.*
*Waiting for you to awaken,
Knowing your encounter—
Abandoning home, seizing transcendent play.*
*Suddenly aware of the original essence,
Discarding dust and burdens—
Now refining lead, then refining mercury.*
*In the depths of stillness,
Nurturing the *spiritual pearl* as an offering.*
*Until the merit is complete and the path fulfilled,
Then you’ll ride the clouds and cross the winds.*
*To the *Penglai Island*,
The celestial attendants will far and wide come to welcome you.*

**#2** *"Remembering Prince Wangsun*
*The seven treasures are plain—
No need to debate.
One, four, one, three—
Each swallows their own kind.
The *returning-yang soul*—
This is the true way to preserve life and command fate."*

**Dan Yang’s Reply**
*The Master’s profound discourse on the Wind Sage,
Speaks clearly of the *non-doing* gate of purity.
On the tongue, the sweet nectar is savored.
Nourishing the soul’s essence,
Wrapped in yin, generating yang—
Preserved through countless kalpas.*

**#3** *"Laughing at the Mountain of Jade*
*Lost in illusion, unable to transform.
My stubborn heart is locked tight—
How can it open?
Even wealth and fortune cannot escape calamity.
The allotted years,
Will eventually fall into the wheel of rebirth.
The ghostly messengers hasten their summons.
Children and grandchildren cannot replace you—
What can be done?
Then comes the time of bitter regret, wailing in sorrow.
Only then do you know—
Studying the Dao is the path to divine material.*

**Dan Yang’s Continuation**
*Bold men leap forth in resolve.
Name and profit are cast aside—
Freed at last.
It is fitting to end suffering and death.
Crossing beyond the shore,
No hope of another cycle.*
*The Master’s words urge me.*
*Daoist robes must be donned,*
*Serving the heart—*
*No more pushing.*
*Even if my wife and children weep in grief,*
*I’ll depart for the West,*
*Becoming one who rides the clouds.*

**#4** *Lingering by the River’s Edge*
*The chestnut’s flavor calls all *Dao-Children*—
The *True Person* instructs *Mr. No-Worries* (法名通不字全道，道号无忧子).
The taro’s nourishment draws them back.
Each eats and knows no worry.
Four, three, twelve—
All descend the *heavy palaces*.
Eating past the time of ice as water,
Within the water, two specks of floating *stagnant qi*.
Coming and going—when will it cease?
If you would join my wish,
I’ll ensure you attain true cultivation."*

**《Dan Yang Total Rhyme》**

**Great Awakening in the Body’s Dwelling**
A *straw-suit* and *gourd-hat*—how fine!
When fate aligns, one turns back.
You’re taught the *True Dao* name—*Mr. No-Worries*.
With wisdom-eyes gazing at the *Jade Cavern*,
Cloud-steps ascending the *Jade Tower*.
The *Red Wild Goose* dives into the *Pure and Tranquil Land*,
The *White Egret* cradles *stagnant qi* in its claws.
Two natures blend—now rest in peace.
To banish the *Three Realms’* suffering,
Refine the *One Essence*—that’s the way.

**《Yellow River Clears》**
*(Counting to One Hundred and Eight)*
The *Nine Bends* of the Yellow River turn ninefold,
Its surging waves now pure and still.
The *Nine Rivers* converge, all returning to the Right Path.
At the *Nine Cauldrons’* core, the manifestation appears,
The *Nine Palaces* unfold—*Endless Flow* is fixed.
Where *Jade* tumbles and *Gold* spills, overflowing,
The *Nine Luminaries* are eclipsed by inverted light.
The *Nine Heavens* gleam emerald-green in harmony,
At the *Nine Marshes*, cranes call—welcoming luminous purity.
The *Nine Lights* pierce through, reflecting divine radiance.
The *Nine-Bend* spirit-pearl leaps,
The *Nine Immortals* arrive—swimming as they will.
Deep *Chan* clarity shines through,
Achieving the *Nine-Heaven* path to *Holy Perfection*.

**《Dan Yang’s Continuing Rhyme》**
The *Nine Bends* flow, turning nine times,
Yin and yang in reverse—pure in motion.
Within the *Nine Pools*, the *Dragon Spring* wells forth, upright.
The *Nine Gatherings* stretch from the beginning’s stillness,
The *Nine Passes* reveal—*Enduring Waves* forever fixed.
Auspicious *Mushrooms* bloom naturally refined,
The *Nine Stems* stand—no shadow in their grace.
The *Nine Clouds* veil the *Cauldron*, its glow pure,
The *Nine Returns* forge—*Spirit Elixir* radiant.
The *Nine Mysteries* of the Ancestors,
Urge you to climb—shoulder to shoulder with the Immortals.
The *Eighty-One* *Double-Nine* oral precepts,
Passed in secret—extraordinary swimming.
Accumulating *True Function*,
Later ascending the *Nine Heavens* to meet the Sage.

**《Lingering by the River’s Edge》**
The *Eight Trigrams* clearly laid out,
Two persons—four *Yang*, four *Yin*.
Searching the *Mystic Center* with care.
If you taste this flavor,
You’ve found the *True Gold*.
Serene and hidden—pure and clear,
Sweet and fragrant—its praise resounds.
On *Eight-Tu* Mountain rises the high peak.
Just when you can gaze upon it,
That’s when you’ll ascend.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
The *Eight Consciousnesses* known—the heart is settled,
Surveying all things—*Yin* is all.
Better to focus and seek.
Nurture *Fire* within the water,
Cultivate *Gold* within the *Jade*.
Wait until *Pure Yang* elixir doesn’t leak,
Then you’ll be called a *True Connoisseur*.
Ascending *Cloud-Steps* to the *Jade Peaks*,
No need to strain your eyes—
The radiance comes naturally.

**《Poem to Dan Yang》**
A hundred days of *Gate-Seclusion*—intent now set,
You must be worthy to be my companion.
The *Horse-Ape* returns to nature through longing,
The *Peach-Plum* blushes—shy of human touch.
From now on, if you can make firm decisions,
Upright and true—this is the right cause.
The *Oar* is already in the *Midstream*,
Hard to descend—*Free-Sailing* to the shore.

**《Dan Yang’s Continuing Rhyme》**
Today’s vow is solemnly made—
A *Disillusioned* one beyond the world.
Refining *Qi*, nurturing *Spirit*—ever joyful,
Walking the streets, no shame in bare hands.
Breaking free from the *Worldly Net*, returning to *True Interest*,
Leaping from the *Cage*—gaining true freedom.
Following the *Original Master* through *Clouds and Waters*,
Sailing *Adrift* on the *Spirit-Boat*.

**《Absolute Verse》**
They say to cultivate the *Great Dao*,
First examine within your own body.
I urge you, *Master*—don’t indulge in emotions,
For if *Heaven* had emotions, *Heaven* would age.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
Meeting a *Clear Teacher*, returning to the *Right Path*,
The *Returning Light* reflects in the heart.
Naturally awakened—free of dusty emotions,
Within you, cultivation completes—*Immortality* unfolds.

**《No Longing for Home #3》**
*(To Dan Yang)*
The *chestnut’s* flavor is worth gathering,
But the *taro’s* fragrance surpasses it.
From now on, eat with mindfulness,
Pursuing—why do all seek six schemes?
Searching carefully, examining closely,
The *taro* has green shoots, the *chestnut* has *stagnant qi*.
Beyond the void, within the earth—one place.
Rest, rest—
Speak of the *Mystic*—the more you explain, the more you worry.

**《Dan Yang’s Continuing Rhyme》**
Taming the *Wild Horse*—function now gathered,
Not letting the *Monkey-Mind* peek out.
A single *Luminous Clarity* returns to the *Great Primordial*,
Why seek?—
The *Six Subtle Mysteries* need no scheming.
The *taro* and *chestnut* are examined leisurely,
Knowing the taste, hearing the scent—*stagnant qi* is exposed.
Seek the *Echo* in the void,
Endless *True Joy* and *True Happiness*—dissolving all sorrow.

**《Gift to Sun Gu》**
At home, just *Second Auntie* calls you,
Leaving home—no *Fire Altar* to tend.
If you can cultivate and refine,
Let people forever call you *Immortal Lady*.

**《Gazing at Penglai #4》**
*Nine Transformations*—*Nine Transformations*,
Use the *Treasure-Sword* to cut.
Don’t let the *Yin-Soul* follow demons,
Gather the *Yang-Spirit*—chase the *Good Pear*.
Now free from *Rebirth*.
Listen, listen—
The *Dao-Eye* opens wide.
The *Four False Bodies* must be refined,
The *One True Nature* carefully guessed.
You’ll see *Penglai*.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
*Penetrating the True*—*Nine Times*,
*Penetrating the True*—within you, function cuts.
Even if *Dragons and Serpents* rise from the earth,
*Clouds and Cranes* descend from the sky.
Morning tides return at dusk.
The *White Lotus* blooms,
The *White Lotus* blooms—
Naturally, the *Blue Lotus* opens.
Through the *Pure Gate*, entry and exit are free,
On the *Non-Action Path*, no need for guessing.
You’ll surely reach *Penglai*.

**《Dan Yang’s Questions》**
Dan Yang asked me: Why don’t you dwell on drinking cold water?
I replied: I myself encountered the Pure Yang Sage at the Sweet River,
And thus drank water from it.
Hence, this poem was composed.

The *Harmful Wind* knows the water’s measure,
Through this, the *Mystic Dao* is revealed.
White hemp coarse robes, green headscarf—
Such a fine appearance, truly invigorating *Qi*.
No need for a mirror to reflect,
All is clear in the mind’s eye.

In dreams, you discern the dream-body itself,
And thus you are the carefree one who reaches the far shore.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
The *Harmful Wind* is dispelled—*Qi* dust grows less,
The *Mystic Dao’s* wonders are now understood.
Naturally ashamed to wear the coarse hemp headscarf,
The *True Breath* flows gently—no need for frantic vitality.
The *Wisdom Lamp* shines continuously, illuminating the heavens,
Life and *Nature* must now be fully realized.
The golden furnace is the body for refining the *Golden Elixir*,
Serene and carefree, you become a free and easy man.

**《Peony Pavilion》**
*(Unfinished)*

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
*Peony Pavilion*—
The *Sweet Lotus* (peach) is two or three,
The *Dharma* (law) is like the *Taro Root*—six in total.
Only two are allotted to quietude.

Reflecting on them—
Sweet and fragrant, how so?
The five *Zang* organs are clear,
And the six *Fu* viscera—none are lacking.
There is also the *Golden Elixir*—one more.
Twelve in all—
Ask the revered master,
And he will explain.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
The *Taro Root* and *Sweet Lotus* are six in number,
Encountered and bestowed—
The Pure Yang Sage is the *Three Officials*.
The *Taro Root* is the *Encounter*,
The *Three Officials* are the Pure Yang Sage himself.
The three disciples stand forgotten.

The *Sweet Lotus* is the *Standing*—
My three disciples all stand long,
Hence this line.

Searching carefully,
Within them, recognize—
Among them, the *True Nature*.
The *Moon of Nature* is full and round,
True joy—no sorrow at all.

Someone asked: Why does the *Harmful Wind*?
I tell you—
Abandon that,
Gain this.

**《Gift to Dan Yang》**
Do not fear the *Kingly Wind*’s chill,
For the *Kingly Wind* is not cold.
A hundred mornings pass swiftly,
The path ahead—you and I will see.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
The *Leaking Nature* often worries about cold,
The *Unfeeling* does not sense it.
To enter the realm beyond the clouds,
Abandon worldly wisdom—look with the *Divine Eye*.

**《Gratitude for the Sage’s Grace》**
A hundred days locked within the hermit’s gate,
The *Sweet Lotus* (peach) ten times transformed.
Leisurely and clear—
Nurturing *True Nature* and *False Nature*.
I sigh and ask,
How could I receive such carefree grace?
You and I know this,
Truly refined and elegant.
There is another kind—
Distinct and fine like a painting.
Frequently, you lift and display it,
Temporarily hanging it aside.
If you wish to see it,
A hundred thousand *hu* of pearls would be its worth.
When I recall and recount,
Just a few words.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
The *Clockwork and Lute* (Zhu Lü) dispel the *Harmful Wind*’s Sage,
Specializing in *Dao* instruction.
Thus, the hermit’s gate is locked,
And this is no falsehood.
Using clever means to lure me,
Secretly eradicating *False Awareness*—
I awaken from my family’s madness,
Abandoning scholarly elegance.
The true essence—
Hard to describe, hard to depict.
Six *qian* of cloth radiant with color,
Worn like armor.
Holding the *Golden Elixir*’s seed,
Gleaming light—priceless.

It is because of your transmission,
Not ordinary words.

**《Repaying the Teacher’s Grace》**
Why do I not tire of writing poems?
This reason only I know.
A single stroke of script opens the *True Awakening*,
The *Three Fields* (of cultivation) are passed—
The *Pure Yang Sage* is the *End*.
The *Root of Life* is deeply planted—just in time.
The *Mystic Dao’s* secrets are tightly sealed,
Calling me forth—then I depart to the *Jade Pool*.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
Today, kneeling to receive my teacher’s verse,
The hidden *Dao* secrets—joyfully understood.
Piercing through all *Dharma* (phenomena), forgetting false appearances,
Cleansing the six desires—arising in *True Virtue*.
Marriage and matchmaking need no further thought,
Extinguish desire—abandon worldly concerns.
Respectfully following my teacher’s path to the clouds and waters,
In the end, I will surely reach the *Heavenly Pool*.

**《Gift to Dan Yang》**
The wine’s initial clarity,
The dream’s first shock.
The moon’s first brightness,
The *Nature*’s first balance.
As if awakening,
This is the path ahead.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
Awakening from drunkenness,
Startled from sleep.
Illuminated in darkness,
Balanced within.
The mind opens—
The path ahead is gained.

**《Vow to Dan Yang’s Descendants》**
I swear Dan Yang’s descendants will enter the *Dao*,
The *Seventh Ancestor* will escape the *Hell of Six Realms*.
Descendants gain the *Dao*,
The *Ninth Ancestor* is born in *Heaven*.
If they retreat from the *Dao*,
They burden their ancestors.

**《Awakening to the Southwood Illusion》**
The *Taro Root* and *Sweet Lotus* are now fully understood,
The wise and foolish alike share in this meal.
One can gather *Yang Qi* into a perfect sphere.
One sinks into *Yin*—
The *Yin-Soul* is further destroyed.
Those who come return to purity,
The lost wander in worldly entanglements.
Entering the *Perfect Dao*, you leap into the *Sage’s Platform*,
Precisely residing—
Forever fortunate, forever together.

**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
Standing in encounter—*Nature* is fully understood,
The fragrant *Dharma*’s taste is savored.
A red flame forms in the water,
Snow-wrapped jade flowers—
Vibrant and unfading.
The *Nature Lamp* shines at the golden gate,
The *Divine Elixir* glows on the jade plate.
Together cultivating the *Six Perfections* and *Three Platforms*,
Emerging from my teacher—
The inner landscape naturally reveals itself.

**《Absolute Verse》**
The two revered masters know only of the world’s dwellings,
Not that *Penglai* holds a jade jar.
If they would turn back and cultivate *Awakening*,
Their names would forever be called by the *Immortal Maidens*.

**《Jade Hall Spring》**
*Jade Nature* and *Golden True*—
All can transform.
*Jade Nectar* and *Golden Elixir*,
Frequently welcomed and received.
*Jade Hare* and *Golden Crow*,
Their lights shine in succession.
Illuminating the jade railing—
Jade sprouts grow.
*Jade Buds* and *Golden Stems*,
Everlasting, never withering.
*Jade Maidens* and *Golden Boys*,
Often observed and cherished.
*Jade Locks* and *Golden Keys*,
Every gate opens and reveals.

**《Appreciating the Jade Hall Spring on Jade Flowers》**
**《Dan Yang’s Follow-Up Rhyme》**
*Jade Awakening* and *Golden Mystic*—
Heart to heart, all are taught.
*Jade Tigers* and *Golden Dragons*,
Frequently welcomed and received.
*Jade Ripples* and *Golden Waves*,
Clear and successive.
In the jade stream—
Jade sprouts grow.
*Jade Leaves* and *Golden Branches*,
Flourishing and immortal.
*Jade Fair Ones* and *Golden Infants*,
Leisurely observed and cherished.
*Jade Gates* and *Golden Passages*,
Brightly open above and below.
