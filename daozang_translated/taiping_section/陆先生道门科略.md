**The *Lüsheng Dao* (Way of Master Lü) – Outline of Its Doctrines**

The Great Dao is void and tranquil, transcending all form and appearance;
The Most Exalted Sage’s conduct and teachings are embodied in words and precepts.

Since the time of the Most High Laozi (太上老君) onward, ancient practices have fallen into disarray:
Pure and unadulterated, yet scattered and crude, the Three and Five (三五) were disordered,
Humans and spirits confused, the Six Heavens’ residual *qi* (故氣) falsely claiming the titles of *Guānshàng* (官上) officials.
They amalgamated the hundred spirits (百精) and the Five Injured (五傷) ghosts,
Defeated generals and slain soldiers, chaotic troops and fallen warriors—
Men were called *Jiāngjūn* (將軍), women *Fūrén* (夫人),
Leading ghostly armies, moving like wandering robbers across the heavens and earth,
Wielding arbitrary power, demanding tribute from households,
Seeking offerings at ancestral shrines (飨祠), disturbing the people,
Slaughtering the three kinds of sacrificial animals (三牲), consuming vast wealth,
Draining finances and exhausting resources—
Yet they did not receive blessings in return,
But instead brought calamity upon those who honored them.
Premature deaths and untimely fates (枉死橫夭) were countless.

The Most High, seeing such chaos, thus bestowed upon the *Tiānshī* (天師) the *Zhèngyī Miéngwēi* (正一盟威) precepts—
Instituting prohibitions and doctrinal laws,
Examining the conduct of all under heaven to determine their blessings and misfortunes, rewards and transgressions,
So they might know what is good and what is evil.

Establishing Twenty-Four *Zhì* (治) and Thirty-Six *Jìng* (靖) halls,
With two thousand four hundred Daoists—both inner and outer—
Under the *Qiān Èr Bǎi Guān Zhāngwén* (千二百官章文) of ten thousand decrees,
They wielded talismans to destroy temples (誅符伐廟),
Slayed ghosts to save lives (殺鬼生人),
Purified the cosmos (蕩涤宇宙),
Restored the proper order of the Three and Five (明正三五),
Encompassing the heavens and earth—
No more could the licentious and depraved ghosts (淫邪之鬼) prevail.

They abolished all forbidden altars (禁心),
Simplified governance, and refined the administration of the people.
The gods did not partake in food and drink,
The Daoists did not accept money.

Thus the people were taught to cultivate inner filial piety and benevolence (內修慈孝),
And to practice outer reverence and humility (外行敬讓),
To aid the times in harmonizing nature (佐時理化),
And to assist the state in preserving life (助國扶命).

Only the Son of Heaven (天子) may sacrifice to Heaven,
The Three Exalted Ministers (三公) to the Five Sacred Peaks (五嶽),
The feudal lords (諸侯) to mountains and rivers,
And the common folk on the five *Là* (腊) days and auspicious dates (吉日),
Honoring their ancestors (祠先人),
Or on the *Chūnqiū* (春秋) and *Shè* (社) days,
Sacrificing to the earth gods and kitchen altars (祭社灶).
Beyond these occasions, no further sacrifices are permitted.

If one sacrifices to ancestors outside the five *Là* days or on non-auspicious dates,
Or if one worships the earth gods and kitchen altars outside the *Chūnqiū* and *Shè* days,
All such acts are deemed *Yínzhì* (淫祠)—licentious sacrifices.

If the sick, unable to endure broths, medicines, acupuncture, or moxibustion,
Only take talismans and drink water,
Or if one’s sins since birth—
Those deserving death—are all pardoned,
And chronic illnesses or lingering afflictions are healed,
Then the highest virtue brings divine transcendence (上德神仙),
The middle virtue grants doubled lifespan (中德倍壽),
And the lowest virtue extends years (下德延年).

Yet today’s adherents of the Dao have inverted these principles—
Nothing is done correctly, all is reversed.

I humbly propose to rectify their ailments as follows:
The *Tiānshī* (天師) should establish proper governance and appoint officials,
Just as the *Yángguān* (陽官) oversee prefectures, counties, and city halls,
And all Daoists should be registered as household members (編戶著籍),
Each belonging to their respective authority.

On the *Zhèngyuè Qīrì* (正月七日), *Qīyuè Qīrì* (七月七日), and *Shíyuè Wǔrì* (十月五日)—
Three gatherings each year—
The people should assemble before their local Daoist masters (本治師),
Who will then update the registers and records (改治錄籍),
Removing the dead and adding the living (落死上生),
Correcting hidden discrepancies and false declarations (隱實口數),
Establishing the true household ledgers (正定名簿),
And issuing the Three Announcements and Five Commandments (三宣五令),
So the people may know the law.

On these days, the *Tiānguān* (天官) and earthly deities (地神) will all convene at the Daoist halls (師治),
To verify the records in person.
Both Daoists and laypeople must maintain solemn silence and purity (清靜肅然),
Refraining from alcohol, meat, noise, or laughter.
After the gathering, the people should return home
And diligently convey the precepts, prohibitions, rituals, and teachings (聞科禁威儀教勑大小) to all,
Great and small, ensuring strict observance.

Thus the Dao’s influence will spread, and the land will know great peace (家國太平).
Yet today’s Daoists often fail to attend the gatherings,
Some claiming the halls are too distant,
Others that this sect does not go there,
Abandoning their true masters and visiting other halls instead.
They indulge in wine and feasting,
Mutually enticing one another in the streets.
The clear precepts and correct teachings are neglected,
No longer proclaimed, and the ancient laws and decrees (法典舊章) are thus lost.

Once the fundamental principles are abandoned,
Then all else collapses into chaos (萬目亂溃),
Ignorant of the precepts,
Only trusting in *Yínzhì* (淫祠) sacrifices.
Daoist adherents do not recognize right and wrong,
But only seek food and drink in their rituals.

Both masters and disciples have strayed—
No longer is there proper guidance.
They act in secret, falsifying records,
Every movement is contrary to the law (動則乖喪),
Confusing truth for falsehood, falsehood for truth,
Right for wrong, wrong for right—
In myriad ways, nothing is done correctly.
Chaos and disorder reign, and they never realize their errors.

Such masters will perish, their lineage extinguished;
Such disciples will die young, their fates ruined.
Though future generations may remain unaware,
The past has made this abundantly clear—
The enlightened and virtuous cannot fail to heed this warning.

The Daoist household registers (道科宅錄) are the people’s supplementary records.
All male and female names must be duly registered.
The officials who guard the registers must uphold their accuracy,
And any changes in household numbers must be updated accordingly.
If a male child is born and reaches one month,
One hundred sheets of paper and a pair of writing brushes are offered,
And an upper kitchen (上廚) of ten attendants is set.
If a female child is born and reaches one month,
A broom and a dung basket—each one—are offered,
Along with a mat, and a middle kitchen (中廚) of five attendants is set.

Upon marriage, an upper kitchen of ten attendants is established,
And the register keeper must present the household records (宅錄) to the local Daoist master (本治),
Who will then update the records in accordance with the true household ledgers (更相承錄，以注正命籍).
On the three gathering days, the Three Officials and Ten Thousand Gods (三官萬神) will cross-examine the registers.

If new births are not recorded, the Heavenly Bureau (天曹) will have no names;
If deaths are not removed, the ledgers will be inaccurate.
Yet today’s Daoists often register only one person at the start,
And neglect to update the records for their descendants.
On the gathering days, they fail to submit their status,
Lacking both beginning and end—
Their true masters cannot know the situation,
And they are held accountable to the previous year’s records.

Or, when bones have rotted after death,
The registers still list them as living;
Or, when a child is born and grows old,
They are never recorded at all.
Or, when taking a wife, they fail to register her,
Or, when a daughter is married off, they fail to remove her name.

Thus there are cases of century-old boys who have never been registered,
And elderly virgins who have never been recorded as married.
Such confusion between life and death, presence and absence,
Leads to false records on the day of illness—
When they do not return to their true masters but instead appeal to other officials.
Those other officials, not investigating the cause,
Simply issue talismans without proper justification.
For those whose bodies are in agony,
But whose names are not in the registers,
These new talismans appear without reason—
Not belonging to the guardians of the household records (非守宅所部),
The Three Masters (三師) do not recognize them,
The Three Heavens (三天) lack their names in the ledgers,
The *Sīmìng* (司命) officials have no record of them,
And they are left to waste away in vain (徒碎首於地).
The documents are in disarray,
The rituals are not followed,
And the Dao cannot bring salvation.

「Such reasoning should not be overlooked. The Daoist rites of **commanding the Way** (奉道) are founded on the **Three Masters** (師) recording life and death (命籍). For the **Dao-citizens** (道民), faith (信) is the primary virtue.

The **Three Masters** register them with the **Three Heavens** (三天), and the **household guardians** (守宅之官) protect them according to their recorded names (籍口) to avert disasters and repel misfortunes. Though there are three annual assemblies (三会), the **Great Limit** (大限) is set on the fifth of the tenth month when the **life-and-death talisman** (信命) is delivered to the **Hall of Treatment** (治).

If a household remains secure, five **culinary officials** (厨) are appointed. If the number of mouths in the household decreases, the culinary officials are not set, yet the **life-and-death talisman** remains unchanged. If the **life-and-death talisman** fails to reach its destination, the records of life and death are not accepted.

Though there are additional **heavy culinary blessings** (重厨福), they cannot compensate for the deficiency of this talisman. Thus, the teachings say: *"Even if gold is precious, it cannot compare to the sacred talisman of life and death."* Households that command the Way without delivering the **life-and-death talisman** (命信) will, over time, see their names erased from the **Three Heavens'** ledgers** (三天削落名籍), their **household guardians** return to the **Celestial Bureau** (天曹), and the **Dao-qi** (道氣) no longer shield them. They will suffer harm from malevolent spirits (鬼贼), leading to untimely illness and death (丧疾夭横). Such households will never realize their peril, yet they blame their teachers and revile the Way—how could this not bring decline?

For households that command the Way, maintaining a **serene chamber** (靖室) is the place of utmost sincerity. Its exterior must be isolated, not connected to other dwellings; its interior must be pure and empty, free of extraneous objects. Opening and closing doors must be done with reverence, never carelessly or abruptly. Sweeping and tidying must be meticulous, as if the chamber were a **divine abode** (神居). Only a **fragrant censer** (香炉), **sacred lamp** (香灯), **talisman case** (章案), and **ritual knife** (书刀) should be placed there. These must be kept immaculately clean—even a hundred coins are insufficient to ensure their purity.

Compare this to the **common households** (俗之家): their beds, seats, statues, banners, and coverings are adorned with countless embellishments. Is there not a stark difference between simplicity and extravagance, refinement and vulgarity?

Yet today, those who command the Way often lack a **serene chamber**. Some mark off a corner with a railing as their **treatment altar** (治坛), never clearing it of weeds and thorns that pierce the sky. Others, though they erect a dwelling, have no doors, allowing livestock to roam freely and filth to reach their knees. Some claim to have a **serene chamber**, yet store household goods within, with reckless comings and goings, and rats and dogs nesting there. How distant is such devotion from the **sublime and refined Way** (尊妙之道)?

Daoist **ritual attire** (法服) is like the **court robes** (朝服) of the world. Officials, nobles, commoners, and all ranks have distinct gradations, governed by the **Five Hierarchies** (五等). Thus, the *Classic of Filial Piety* (《孝经》) states: *"One does not dare wear the ritual robes of the ancient kings unless they are authentic."* The old ritual robes include **single garments** (单衣) and **black hemp mats** (祫帻), along with **arrow-generating robes** (箓生) and **cloth wrappings** (袴褶) for receiving the **talisman of Treatment** (受治之信). Males deliver **single garments of black** (单衣墨帻), while females offer **indigo robes** (绀衣). These clear distinctions suffice to resolve any doubts.

The **headwrap** (巾) and **rough hemp garments** (褐), as well as the **ritual apron** (帔) and **skirt** (裙), originate from the **Highest Dao** (上道). One wears the **rough hemp garments** when performing **rites of reverence** (礼拜), and the **ritual apron** when reciting **sutras** (诵经). These are the **precepts of the Three Caverns** (三洞)—how could they be trivial to lesser Daoists?

Recently, those who have only just received the **minor talisman of Treatment** (小治) have secretly and improperly adopted the **arrow-generating robes** (箓生) and **cloth wrappings** (袴褶), already a grave error. Then they further compound it by wearing **caps and wrappings** (帽褶) with **skirts** (对裙), and **rough hemp garments** (帔褐) over **cloth wrappings** (着袴). Such chaotic mixing—how could it be called proper?

The **headwrap**, **rough hemp garments**, **skirt**, and **ritual apron** each have precise measurements in length and width, as well as the number of threads and seams. Thus, they are called **ritual attire** (法服), all bearing the **aura of威威 and神神** (威神). The **True Person of the Supreme Ultimate** (太极真人) declared: *"If ritual attire is not made according to the precepts, the spirits and gods will punish the wearer."* Since these are not merely usurpations of rank but outright excess, how could misfortune be avoided?

The **precepts and teachings** (科教) state: *"Three acts of diligence constitute one merit (功), and three merits constitute one virtue (德)."* When a **Dao-citizen** (道民) possesses **three virtues**, they differ from the common folk and may be appointed to the **clerical ranks** (署箓). After receiving the **clerical talisman** (箓), they must further cultivate and advance through merit, progressing from the **talisman of the Ten Generals** (十将军箓) to the **rank of One Hundred Fifty** (百五十).

If among the **clerical officials** (箓吏) there are those who are **loyal and pure** (忠良质朴), **dutiful and cautious** (小心畏慎), **devoted to the Dao** (好道翘勤), and **versed in both old and new teachings** (温故知新), capable of **proclaiming the transformations** (宣化), they may be appointed as **scattered-qi Daoists** (散气道士). If among the **scattered-qi Daoists** there are those who **cultivate purity** (清修), they may be advanced to the **rank of separate treatment** (别治职任). If among those who **separately treat** (别治) there are those who **refine their practice** (精笃), they may be advanced to the **rank of wandering treatment** (游治职任). If among those who **wander and treat** (游治) there are those who **maintain strict discipline** (严能), they may be appointed as **lower treatment Daoists** (下治职任). If among the **lower treatment Daoists** there are those who **distinguish themselves by merit** (功称), they may be advanced to the **rank of paired treatment** (配治职任). If among those who **pairedly treat** (配治) there are those who **conform perfectly to the law** (合法), all **original treatment Daoists** (本治道士) should recommend them, presenting them as descendants of the **Celestial Master** (天师), for advancement to the **rank of Three Hundred Eighty** (三八之品).

First, they are appointed to the **lower eight ranks** (下八之职). If they **diligently cultivate the Dao** (伏勤於道) and **persuade others with merit** (劝化有功), they may advance to the **middle eight ranks** (中八之职). If they **rescue all under heaven** (救治天下万姓), **support the perilous and aid the weak** (扶危济弱), and **can prolong life three times** (能度三命), they may advance to the **upper eight ranks** (上八之职). Those who **master the refinement of Dao-qi** (明炼道气), **save and benefit all beings** (救济一切), **dispel malevolent spiritual energy** (消灭鬼气), and **bring all under heaven to submission** (使万姓归伏) may be granted the **ranks of the Three Gases: Yangping, Lùtáng, and Hèmíng** (阳平、鹿堂、鹤鸣三气治职).

They must **scrutinize and implement** (精察施行) their **merits and virtues** (功德), seeking appropriate ranks and appointments. They must not **burden officials with unworthy individuals** (以人负官) nor **fail to appoint worthy individuals** (以官负人). If one **studies the Dao without proper lineage** (不由师成), they are **not a true root** (非根生). If one **does not inherit their original name** (不承本名), they are **rootless weeds** (无根之草). Receiving Daoist talismans out of proper order is called **not a true root** (非根生); not following one’s **original teacher** (本师) is called **not inheriting the original** (不承本).

Yet today, people receive Daoist talismans without these virtues, and they receive treatment without the requisite talent. These virtues refer to the **three virtues** (三德), and this talent is the **ability to proclaim transformations** (宣化之才). Some have no **teacher or talisman records** (师籍), though they may have previously commanded the Way, having lost their teacher long ago and never reattached themselves. Others were once common folk, wandering as strangers, taking up Daoism frivolously and with false pretenses. Daoists do not first **conform to the precepts and transform them** (依法化受), yet they are hastily granted talismans and treatment. Such individuals are entirely **devoid of substance** (虚妄), merely **pretending to be Daoists** (徒为道士). Even if they **diligently cultivate and perform good deeds** (修勤服善), the **Three Heavens** (三天) have no record of them, so they cannot escape **unjust suffering** (枉横). What then of those who **neglect and defy** (放慢违逆)?

Some have **teachers without talisman records** (师无籍)—that is, though they have a teacher and master, they do not attend the **three annual assemblies** (三会), the **life-and-death talisman** does not reach its destination, their names are erased from the **Celestial Bureau** (天曹), hence they are **without**. Others, though they possess **teacher and talisman records**, lack virtue. On the day they receive their talismans, they instead **visit other officials**, neither returning to their **original teacher** nor ascending through proper ranks. They **recklessly accept appointments**, without discernment, and though many wear talismans and receive treatment, the treatment is **greatly flawed**. They compete to outdo one another in rank, advancing **unjustly**—so that one **personally receives the rank of lower treatment**, yet **appoints others to higher ranks**.」

The so-called disciples who have received the *Pínggài* and *Yùjú* talismans from the Celestial Master yet are appointed as *Yángpíng* or *Lùtáng* officials—these are the very ones who receive the *Bái Bǎn* and then impose it upon others.

Those who have received the *Bái Bǎn* talisman, failing to present themselves to the Celestial Master for rectification, instead persist in passing it down to others for their entire lives. They act with reckless inversion, their misdeeds arising in chaotic confusion. With a body burdened by accumulated offenses, they wear hollow, false talismans. They have no household registration, yet maintain illicit correspondence. Some were once laypersons, burdened by ghostly sacrifices, who then entered Daoist practice without clearing their debts. From the moment they took up the path, their crimes and sins were rampant, yet they cling to their offenses, refusing repentance. They seek out deluded and false teachers, receiving untrue teachings.

They lack precepts and discipline, disregard instructions, violate prohibitions, and hold Dao and its laws in contempt. Those who receive the Dao must uphold precepts within and maintain proper decorum without, following prohibitions and adhering to instructions. Thus, the scriptures say: *"If a Daoist does not receive the Old Lord’s one hundred and eighty precepts, they lack virtue and are not truly a Daoist. They may not receive the people’s worship, nor may they treat ghosts and spirits."* Since they are ignorant and unworthy, they do not understand the reverence of Daoist virtue. Their conduct is reckless and disrespectful toward sacred rites.

They indulge their greedy desires, drowning themselves in wine and gluttony. When practicing Daoist methods, they do not seek merit, and when treating others, they lack compassion. Their intentions are fixed on wealth and food, never instructing the people in prohibitions. They demand heavy tributes, inquire about fine foods, and consume the five pungent vegetables and the six kinds of meat—most taboo in Dao—violating prohibitions by slaughtering chickens, pigs, geese, and ducks. They drink to excess, then use this as an excuse to report their misconduct. Some even vomit beside the altar, and such individuals are not uncommon.

They abandon the pure and upright teachings of the *Alliance of威严* (威严盟), which states: *"The teacher does not accept money, the spirits do not drink or eat"*—this is called *Qīngyuē* (清约, purity and restraint). In treating illness, they do not use acupuncture, moxibustion, or herbal medicine, but only prescribe talismans and water. Their first offense is altering their conduct, submitting false reports instead. In matters of residence, tombs, relocation, or movement, they do not consult auspicious days or times, acting purely by whim, avoiding nothing. This is called *Yuē* (约, restraint). They neglect the myriad spirits and deities, yet claim to serve the Three Teachers of the Old Lord—this is called *Zhèngjiào* (正教, true teaching). Instead, they follow perverse and heretical methods:

- Invoking ghosts and spirits for divination and fortune-telling is called *Xiān* (邪, heresy).
- Speaking in the names of ghosts and spirits, predicting fortune and misfortune, is called *Xiān* (祆, Zoroastrian-like divination).
- Creating taboos without proper Daoist authority is called *Wū* (巫, shamanistic).
- Writing false charts for graves, residences, foundations, geomancy, or predicting calamities must be reported and expelled. Yet they still consult calendars, select days and times, and grow even more foolish. They refuse to follow the clear prohibitions, instead competing to use what the law forbids, turning from truth to falsehood—this is called *Dào* (倒, inversion).

They wield official seals and documents, wandering through villages. True Daoist practice is modest and unassuming, responding only when summoned, quietly refining their arts until seekers arrive. To parade through the streets is forbidden by law. When encountering those who violate prohibitions, they suffer misfortune. Though they claim to be Daoist followers, they have long abandoned their teachers, their talismans unregistered, their households without proper records. Some, though they have teachers, fail to attend the three auspicious assemblies on appointed days, yet when urgent matters arise, they hastily offer prayers and sacrifices, accepting favors without gratitude—this is called *Bū* (逋, delinquent). Though they profess Daoist practice, they disregard prohibitions, commit licentious acts, kill, believe in false divination, and engage in all manner of wickedness—this is called *Wéi* (违, transgression).

All who violate prohibitions will have their life-spans recorded in the Celestial Bureau erased, and the Three Officials will dispatch inspectors to guard their homes, interrogating their families and demanding they confess their misdeeds. Heavy crimes bring six calamities; lighter crimes bring five. These are: death, illness, legal troubles, imprisonment, fire, and theft. Such individuals, when facing urgent matters, should be Daoists who use scriptural prohibitions to avert punishment. If they repent sincerely, confess their sins, and swear to the Three Officials in writing, they may then be saved in accordance with the proper procedures.

Yet these deluded and false Daoists, lacking scriptural precepts to defend themselves, cannot distinguish truth from falsehood. They fabricate false reports, alter talismans at will—beginning and end mismatched, unworthy of reverence—yet presume to judge arbitrarily, defiling their cloths and inkstones, dishonoring paper and brushes. They scribble carelessly, staining their work with meat and alcohol, speaking whatever comes to mind, demanding false words without regard for truth. They reverse proper procedures, misjudging whether to absolve or bind, destroy or spare. Their actions are chaotic and unreliable. When submitting petitions, they do not examine the text carefully; what they understand, they proclaim loudly, heard by all neighbors. What they do not comprehend, they stammer and mumble, glossing over it carelessly. Such individuals are not fit to be messengers for officials or soldiers, and the Dao’s *qi* does not descend upon them. The more urgent the inspections become, the more desperate the sick grow, yet the results remain ineffective. Both patient and practitioner are misled, unaware of their errors, leading to slander of the Dao and blame upon the spirits. This may even result in the burning of talismans, destruction of altars, or abandonment of the practice. All such misdeeds invite retribution, bringing ruin to entire families.

Such failures must not go unexamined.

The *Lù Xiānshēng’s Daoist Precept Outline* is complete.
