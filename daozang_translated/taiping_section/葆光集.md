# 葆光集

**Preface to the *Baoguang Collection***

When the primordial chaos had yet to divide, it already contained the true essence of Heaven and Earth; as clarity and turbidity began to separate, the subtle workings of yin and yang unfolded. Thus, the Three Powers were established, the myriad transformations completed, all things flourished, and extraordinary persons emerged among humankind.

Such was the True Person, surnamed Yin, of the illustrious lineage of Cangzhou. His ancestors, born of a single mother, produced nine sons in three births, seven of whom were enfeoffed across eight counties. Thereafter, their cap and sash flourished in splendor—even now, stele inscriptions attest to their renown. Yet the True Person’s achievements surpassed all.

In childhood, he entered stillness, contemplating the origins of Heaven and Earth’s creation; in youth, he left the household, mastering the secrets of nature, life, and transcendence. He guided others and saved beings, examined the ancients to regulate the present, fathomed the beginnings and ends of all affairs, and ranked the worthies of past and present. His beneficence was vast, his transformations boundless; he embraced all with magnanimity, acted without contention, and though provoked, did not retaliate. Where he desired benevolence, benevolence arose; even the unvirtuous were covered in goodness.

This was because he grasped the sentiments of alignment and opposition, understood the causes of the hidden and manifest, and though the past could not be admonished, the future could yet be pursued. He knew advance and retreat, preservation and loss, and practiced forbearance in matters great and small. Slander did not sway him, nor did praise or blame alter his course. In all things, he was thoroughly versed, trusting in the ebb and flow to guide his path.

He moved with the current, blending his traces with the dust; he endured disgrace to secure his person and employed words to admonish the world. His refined verses, inscribed on bamboo and silk, conveyed meaning to ten thousand ages without omission; his dharma teachings, disseminated far, aimed to benefit the present moment.

He could succeed the Quanzhen in expounding the teachings, chronicle the orthodox lineage to perpetuate its fragrance, open the mysterious gate of all wonders, and point the straight path to the Three Purities. Like the sun of wisdom suspended high, he dispelled the shadows of heresy, greatly revived the ancestral wind, and swept away all malevolence and filth. Thus, his gate and courtyard were pure and bright, his realm cool and serene—banishing the lost paths of dark nights to join the sublime domain of Everlasting Spring.

He planned to open a numinous pond, planting myriad golden lotuses; to empty the spirit-boat, bearing a single wheel of luminous moon. Yet knowing that people are difficult to discipline and the Dao does not force its way, he cherished the treasure within and sat in forgetfulness, or expressed his cares through play. Without leaving the square inch of his heart, he traversed distant wilds, then grasped the great thousandfold world and contained it within a hair’s tip.

His mind-field shone bright, illuminating all before perception, hearing, and awareness; his nature-ocean was deep and limpid, perfectly reflecting the cycles of dwelling, decay, and emptiness. Moved, he responded; set aside, he concealed. He was indifferent to non-arising, carefree in quiescence. Unmoving, he transcended the heavens beyond kalpas; ever-present, he abided in the realm before his eyes. All things he examined and penetrated, everywhere he perfected—effortlessly grasping, instantly releasing.

Master of all gates, he awakened to the myriad dharmas and returned them to the heart; having cultivated across many kalpas, he realized the One Truth and merged with the Dao. Thus, long departed from the dusty world, he dwelled for ages in the immortal realm, roaming freely amid the azure vaults, enjoying the mysteries within the Pure Capital.

Above, he matched the millennial covenant of his master and father; below, he awaited the appointed time, manifesting his own body on the following day. This is called: the highest ritual has no form, the utmost yielding has no words—embracing the unnameable name of beauty, uniting with the ancient virtue that claims no virtue.

His causes were auspicious, his reasons selfless. Holding the subtle mechanism of the great Dao, he displayed the elegant model for transforming others. Though trifling conduct may seem insignificant, it ultimately accumulates into great merit. His purity of bearing was sufficient—how could it lack praise?

These reckless, wild words dare to extol his profound sentiments, unafraid of transgressing the three thousand prohibitions, privately invoking the ten thousand vanished traces of the Master’s truth.

The *Baoguang Collection* is the work of this True Person. For thirteen years after receiving the teachings, he often sat in the inner chamber of the Baoguang Pavilion within the Baoxuan Hall of the Great Everlasting Spring Palace. Daily, scholar-officials from the capital and esteemed elders from afar came to seek his counsel, request instruction, or solicit poetic exchanges. Sometimes he expressed his feelings to dispel ennui or offered admonitions and encouragement. During his travels through various regions, he also composed colophons and eulogies upon encountering scenic sites.

The poems, lyrics, songs, and hymns he gathered were arranged in order and divided into three volumes, named after the pavilion. Some say *bao* means "to conceal," signifying the concealment of numinous awareness to prevent its outward dissipation—though responding to myriad changes, it never loses its empty and tranquil essence. *Guang* means "to illuminate," signifying the piercing of darkness to advance unfettered, avoiding pitfalls to enter the realm of the subtle and formless. *Ji* means "to gather," signifying the accumulation of treasures like pearls and jade, deployed to aid the impoverished and suffering.

Such is the general meaning of this compilation—whether it is apt or not.

Others say poetry has four refinements: refining words is inferior to refining lines, refining lines to refining structure, and refining structure to refining intent. Intent is the function of aspiration, the culmination of poetic thought. Thus, what is in the heart becomes aspiration, and when spoken, becomes poetry. The completion of poetry need not rely on exquisite words or robust lines. The *Feng* and *Sao* were beautiful in their time, but beauty lies in virtue, and virtue exalts aspiration. Aspiration is endowed by the Dao; moved, it stirs and is entrusted to words; harmonized and regulated, it becomes literature. Literature arises from words, and if words are blameless, then thoughts are without deviation.

To rectify emotions and nature, clarify gains and losses, uphold loyalty and trust, reject cunning schemes, cease aggression, embrace softness and weakness, treasure compassion and frugality, abandon extravagance and excess, revere lofty integrity, and beautify education—these are the profound attainments of the True Person’s poetry.

As he said:
*"True treasure lies in the heart’s sincere conduct;
Empty words from the mouth are hardly marvelous."*

And again:
*"Where the source of wisdom arises, treachery and deceit flourish;
When courtesy and decorum are manifest, the Dao and virtue decline."*

And again:
*"A violent nature often hears of men transformed into tigers;
A compassionate heart indeed sees trees where dragons take flight."*

And again:
*"Though outer demons assail a thousand times,
A single true heart knows no fear."*

And again:
*"The noble nature remains unshaken by favor or disgrace;
The Dharma King’s body stirs not amid right or wrong."*

Such examples abound throughout these writings—may the reader take heed. For those who grow lax and neglect to read, or act rashly without understanding, alas! What sorrow.

Only Du Dekang, Magistrate of Qinzhou, was a worthy of this age. Upon seeing this collection, he wished all to hear its message, and thus commissioned artisans to carve woodblocks, that its transmission might spread. May enlightened scholars and those of kindred spirit read these words and grasp their truth, awaken to their principles and find their essence. Then, breaking free from worldly entanglements, they may ascend to the true emptiness, their names inscribed on the cinnabar terrace, forever transcending birth and death—truly the intent of a benevolent heart.

Written on the Double Ninth of the year *jihai*, by the disciple the Mist-and-Cloud Recluse, with threefold reverence and ablutions.

*Baoguang Collection*, compiled by the Pure Harmony True Person Yin Zhiping.

**Seven-Character Quatrains**

**Golden Mountain**
From Xuande Prefecture to Lord Tian’s Camp—
some seven or eight thousand *li*—lies north of Golden Mountain.
Northwest the journey nears eight thousand,
yet southward we pass Golden Mountain.
Gazing southwest from Golden Mountain,
only then do the Yin Mountains shimmer faintly in the distance.

**Another**
Once I wandered beneath the immortals’ sun,
five thousand *li* beyond, the waters part their ways.
Men know only the eastern sea’s embrace,
blind to the Great River’s northwest flow.

**Another**
West beyond the Yin Mountains, ten thousand *li* and more,
range upon range of mountains, river upon river.
Five times I crossed the Great River,
yet countless peaks and streams remain unseen.

**Passing the Great Stone Linya of the Qidan State**
"Great Stone" is the Qidan word for "scholar"; "Linya" is a lesser name.
The Central Plains call the Great Stone Linya a state title.
When Liao fell to Jin and lost its homeland,
they fled west to the barbarian lands, ten thousand *li* away.
For a decade they wandered, rootless,
until settling here to till the soil.

**Another**
Through force of arms, the multitudes secured their fields,
and the Great Stone Linya was hailed as king.
Though emperors amassed armies of millions,
now all lies in decline, the cities desolate.

**The Western Regions’ early seasons**—noted for their advance over the Central Plains.
To slake thirst, yellow plums are already tasted;
to sate hunger, white mulberries are gathered.
At the season of Lesser Fullness, early summer’s dawn,
mulberries ripen, plums yellow, wheat turns gold.

**The Master departs on other business**, and cloud-wandering adepts now seldom darken his door. Thus this verse.
The Master gone, friends and companions grow few;
even kindred spirits seem strangers now.
With lofty aims, he forgets worldly affairs—
just as true feeling should be with me.

**Only Prefect Li of the Household daily visits**
This path is hard, each step ascending higher;
those who see it dismiss it as vain toil.
What does my friend from Longxi intend?
Stealing moments from his busyness, he comes once a day.

**Self-Reflection**
Worldly cares no longer stir in me,
yet my thoughts on the Dao and virtue lack sincerity.
Though I’ve received the Master’s teachings a thousandfold,
in every place, I err only in failing to discipline myself.

**Lord Duan retrieves a small fish for release**
A slender scale begged for, spared the pot,
returned to the stream to roam at will.
Say not that one day it may grow into a whale—
even now, its leisure brings joy.

**Composed at Baoxuan Hall**
Stepping out, the eye meets the Western Mountains,
yet for my light karmic ties, I cannot return.
Though my body lingers in Baoguang, carefree and unrestrained,
my heart ever dwells amid the white clouds.

**Matching Academician Chen’s Verse**
The Western Mountains, daylong veiled in mist,
exist because men’s hearts remain unenlightened.
Who would turn back to ask the woods below?
The original face is the true immortal.

**Matching Instructor Zhao’s Verse**
Do not cling even to a hair’s weight in the field of the heart.
I charge you: remember these four lines well.
Seeing no faults in others,
one may be called a master of high virtue.

**For Officer Liu Xuanchai, ill and seeking a poem**
To seek lightness and health, find peace,
try keeping company with Perpetual Spring in Baoxuan.
If you accept a hundred days of abstinence,
in years to come, your bones will be strong, your spirit whole.

**On receiving the Master’s command to depart for Shandong, bidding farewell to Yanjing—an impromptu quatrain**
Returning from the Western Regions, ten thousand *li* and more,
yet still I’ve found no quiet abode.
When at last I reach a place of ease,
I’ll shut my wicker gate and never leave my hut.

**Matching Daoist Recorder Wang’s Verse**
All things know emptiness, coming and going as they will;
in every thought, the heart’s flowers bloom.
Let right and wrong pass the ear—ask no more;
never let the Dao and virtue slip from mind.

**Another**
The teaching wind spreads, meeting Perpetual Spring,
indiscriminate toward officials or common folk.
Each is led to the Purple Palace,
everyone transformed, rising from the red dust.

**The True Person’s "Heaven and Earth"**—four quatrains matched in rhyme

**I**
Heaven’s true immortals, idle yet never idle;
earth’s fools, self-impeding in their folly.
Unknowing that the heart is the root and master,
they labor in vain, bowing to the ten directions.

**II**
Heaven’s host of immortals share one heart;
earth’s myriad dharmas are all empty.
Not knowing the wondrous oneness of Dao and virtue,
they still prattle of west and east.

**III**
Heaven’s splendor arises from the power of the Dao;
earth’s forms are shaped by good deeds.
Unknowing the sagely ones’ expedient means,
they cling to delusion, how few see clearly!

**IV**
Heaven’s true merit is grasped by few;
earth’s images demand refuge.
If one suddenly awakens to the principle of non-birth,
this is the highest mechanism of our gate.

**To the Leaders of Yanjing on Performing Merit**
Merit must be sought through self-denial;
cultivating truth requires a willing heart at rest.
The wise of past and present had few affairs—
those perfect in both merit and wisdom stand first.

**Self-Reflection**
Gazing at this frail, weak body,
my five organs remain at peace.
Though I’ve not yet ascended to the azure skies,
I’m spared this life’s bitter demonic wars.

**Another**
Men admire the strong as heroes,
but I pity the weak who preserve their lives.
Look at all the world’s fame-seekers—
mired in dust, they wage endless war.

**Another**
Thirty years under the true Master’s teaching,
how often he reproached my imperfections!
Swiftly mending my ways in secret, I near old age,
yet on the brink of death, I’m still not whole.

**Two rooms obtained beneath Baoxuan Hall**
Two quiet chambers, one left empty,
a single mat for sleep—joy lies within.
Blame me not for forgetting poverty, living as I please;
it’s only that my mastery of the Dao remains imperfect.

**Another**
A warm room, bright windows—here I sleep,
yet I recall the world’s lingering cold.
Who passes the three winters in ease?
Most fall to the sword, year after year.

**Another**
Dwelling in quiet chambers, clarity grows clearer;
casually, I avoid worldly entanglements.
Though outer demons assail a thousandfold,
my single true heart knows no fear.

**Another**
Originally, a single spark, most solitary and numinous,
tainted by human feelings, ten thousand affairs arise.
To return to the root, to purity,
one must revert to simplicity, enter perfect completion.

**Another**
When active, practice the Dao, study Perpetual Spring;
when at rest, silently merge with the true.
Once the single nature is penetrated, there is no inside or out;
both states flow without near or far.

**Another**
Why strive for clever lines? What is there to vie for?
Unfettered, I chant wildly, writing as the brush moves.
Delighting in my nature, I speak to gladden the Dao;
inspired, I find contentment, seeking no fame.

**For Lord Duan, who retrieved a small fish for release** (repeated for context)
A slender scale begged for, spared the pot,
returned to the stream to roam at will.
Say not that one day it may grow into a whale—
even now, its leisure brings joy.

**For a Chan Monk Who Presented a Painting of Ink Bamboo and Requested a Poem**
Three stalks of Huangshan bamboo I’ve gathered,
unfurled now for the Daoist’s gaze.
Let the world’s fleeting hours rush past—
it knows neither glory nor withering, nor the cold of years.

**For a Daoist Friend Who Requested Tea**
A crisp clarity arises, ever free and bright;
the demon of sleep is vanquished, coolness gained.
All that is wrought must end in rise and fall—
only the unburdened, natural state endures.

**Ascending the Heights**
As white dew scatters, autumn’s depth grows keen,
crimson leaves drift down through the chill woods.
At the Pavilion of Yellow Blossoms, three joys arise—
wine in hand, I sing aloud to dispel the mood.

**Self-Reflection on the Love of Stillness**
From the first, right discernment lies in man’s priority;
seeing affairs, one seeks the wondrous mystery.
Only now do I know my past errors—
when words and self are forgotten, nature is whole.

**Another**
Often I see indulgence invite calamity,
yet never has the perfect Dao brought misfortune.
How have immortals through the ages attained their lot?
All from preserving the mind in stillness.

**Hearing the Sound of a Lute by Moonlight in Baoxuan Hall**
The vastness of Yanshan stretches wide, the night deep and clear;
seated, I hear the calls of passing geese, one or two.
The worldly toil ceaselessly, their hearts still bound—
the recluse sits in silence, his ears keenly attuned.

**Another**
After autumn, Baoxuan grows ever more serene;
in the hush of night, the cries of geese resound.
Sitting in stillness, the sleep demon finds no hold—
moonlight and the heart’s aperture both luminous.

**Viewing Cock’s-Comb Flowers**
A riot of reds withers after ten days,
yet the deep purple of late autumn still withstands the wind.
Do not regard all idle blooms as one—
their natures differ in what they endure.

**For Academician Chen**
Debates arise from varied views,
yet none grasp the true reality.
Worldly chatter cannot exhaust the depths—
transcendent discourse lies in the heart of things.
Who understands that window companions remain as paper apart?
Outside and within, two winds blow.

**Responding to Five Poems Presented by Academician Wu**
Fortunate to be a man, grown in the Central Land,
you claim the highest immortal’s rank among your peers.
Follow the ways of Master Pang and the Xu family—
lift your whole household lightly, sparing them the barren mounds.

**Another**
Content in solitude, I dwell in quiet joy,
spared the world’s hollow praise.
When nature is still, the true teaching flows naturally—
with a heart at ease, why labor over books?

**Another**
Cultivating the real, I seek no reliance on the natural;
year after year, I put it off until next.
I wait only for the Dark Lord’s promised sign—
where now to seek the immortals?

**Another**
Without resolve, man cannot find leisure;
dusk and dawn pass, temples turn silver.
All say the groves and springs nurture the Dao—
how many through the ages have reached their home mountain?

**Composed at Tianchang Abbey**
A fleeting name, lightly grasped, becomes a demon;
how much more so the tangled affairs of human feeling?
Clinging to appearances, wavering without decision—
what end awaits such a path?

**For Academician Chen, Who Requested a Poem on His Cap and Hairpin**
I cherish meeting minds with open hearts,
yet lightly bestow cap and pin.
Your bones bear no trace of the common dust—
when will you return to the groves?

**For Director Liu of Yanjing, Who Renounced the World to Dwell at Yunfeng Abbey in the Western Hills**
The teaching flourishes in the northern wilds,
drawing thousands to the assembly.
You alone have savored its truth, awakened first—
dwell in stillness on Western Mountain, turn back no more.

**Another**
In Pengcheng, your karmic bond with the Dao runs deep;
you submitted your vow, knocking at the gate of mystery.
Now you become master of Yunfeng—
before reaching Penglai, you are already immortal.

**Occasional Verse from Baoxuan Hall**
Seeing through the emptiness of body and all dharmas,
still and unmoving, yet responsive when moved.
The true and constant meets the world without hindrance—
divine transformations reveal sacred power.

**Another**
Day after day, the sun rises east, sets west,
fleeting clouds encroach on the brief light.
Sixty years have passed, old age approaches—
treasure each moment in the empty studio.

**Seizing the Unenlightened Mind**
Do not indulge the unenlightened mind’s fiery karma;
where it arises, true nature lies.
When touched, see through its wondrous subtlety—
then turn the unenlightened mind into your light.

**Five Watches Hymn on Cultivation**

**First Watch**
After evening audience, the first watch begins,
I gather my spirit’s radiance into the great void.
No worldly clamor disturbs my ears—
in the stillness of nature, joy knows no end.

**Second Watch**
In the second watch’s hush, true leisure is found,
qi flows ceaselessly, coming and going.
When the three fields are full, yin ghosts vanish;
with ninefold refinement complete, one joins the immortals’ ranks.

**Third Watch**
At the third watch, the first yang stirs at the third point,
the six jia, three origins, and five qi grow pure.
If not for the root of nature transcending creation,
how could the treasure of life attain perfection?

**Fourth Watch**
By the fourth watch, demons retreat, their troops dispersed;
sound sleep brings peaceful rest, hailing great peace.
In dreams, all is clear, nothing clings—
awakening, a lingering purity remains.

**Fifth Watch**
At the fifth watch, the fifth point, the night wanes,
a will firm as steel, still as a mountain.
Do not say immortals cannot be found—
eternal life lies in questioning the inch of heart.

**Bidding Farewell to the Perfected One Before Journeying to Jinshan**
The great kalpa churns, still unsettled—
I take leave of my master, my heart iron-hard.
What can compare to the Daoist’s resolve?
Even death, when it comes, is no easy matter.

**On the Twenty-Fourth Day of the Eleventh Month, Jia-Shen Year, Taking Leave of My Master**
With several riders, we part from ancient Yanjing,
crossing the northern pass, my spirit unbound.
Lightly, I fulfill my lifelong wish—
on horseback, I chant idly, entering the grotto-heaven.

**Another**
A fair wind bears me to Jiashan,
where I pillow on stone, sleep amid clouds, at ease.
No clamor of the dusty market reaches my ears—
my heart takes flight, recalling the western pass.

**Another**
In the third ninth-day cold, snow blankets the mountains;
the east wind carries me past Yuguan.
Human feelings fade, heaven grants its favor—
perhaps my future holds a share of leisure.

**Composed at Qiuyang Abbey**
I hear Qiuyang’s scenery is secluded,
where immortals have trodden these cliffs.
The verses of Perpetual Spring are truly fit for painting—
their fame spreads far, ceaselessly.

**Another**
Now I wander here at leisure,
chanting poems, my mood unspent.
Recalling the renowned guests of Tianchang—
how many have returned to these cliffs?

**Another**
I have crossed countless famous mountains,
yet none compare to Qiuyang’s serene beauty.
Last year, a true immortal passed this way—
this winter, a wandering guest arrives.

**Spring Day**
Qiuyang lies far from the imperial domain,
unaware of the Eastern Lord’s subtle workings.

Do not marvel that spring arrives belatedly—
the balmy breeze reaches the cliffs in an instant.

**Another**
My body drifts unmoored across the earth,
like tumbleweed or floating duckweed through the years.
I ask not whether my hometown is safe or joyful—
wherever karmic stillness dwells becomes my home.

**Composed at Longyang Abbey on Pure Brightness Day**
Things act yet remain unmoved by emotion,
the six senses at peace, naturally harmonious.
The Three Fields filled with qi, a thousand demons vanish;
a single point of light illumines the ten thousand dharmas.

**Another**
Beyond the world, my idle verses ring pure,
clearing the heart, dispelling delusion.
A wisdom wind scatters the clouds of confusion—
revealing the ever-bright moon as it was.

**Snow in Late Spring at the Mountain’s Rear**
Spring ends, cold clouds suddenly crack like thunder,
jade flakes of the northern peak pile into drifts.
No peach blossoms—gaudy, fleeting—are to be seen,
only pear flowers blooming on a few trees.

**West of the Pass, with Envoy Hua Zongxuan Selecting a Site for an Abbey**
A few riders glide beyond the pass,
playing in this grotto-heaven, hearts at ease.
I seek no warmth from kin or worldly favor—
only that your Dao-eye may open wide.

**Another**
Beyond the pass, the dwelling is profoundly secluded,
mountains deep, rivers distant, waters flowing long.
No need to wash my ears—my heart is ever still;
who would chase a name like Xu You’s?

**After the Completion of Longyang Abbey: A Five-Mu Garden with an Ancient Pine**
Beneath the old pine, hoeing melon vines by day,
I rest and present this to my fellow Daoists.
My master’s blessings were too meager to share the dust;
offerings proved too great, so I withdrew.
I laugh at myself for failing to become a vessel of worth—
content at Longyang to be a melon-tending man.

**An Ancient Pine Behind Longyang Abbey**
Longyang’s ancient pine is worthy of envy,
its branches and leaves unchanged through winter’s turn.
Tall and solitary, it makes a fitting companion—
how unlike the fleeting glory of flowers and grasses.

**From □yang East to Jinshan, Some Two Hundred Li: Local Produce Unmatched Elsewhere**
Huailai’s jade nectar, Dexing’s blossoms—
not inferior to the Central Plains’ finest scenes.
Even more, the idle man finds true delight:
a valley of hemp and wheat as his livelihood.

**On the Double Fifth, with Daoist Companions from Dexing Prefecture Visiting Lingjing Temple on White Stele Mountain**
Seeking liberation from the world’s dust,
I ascend the western peak’s sixty winding turns.
Arriving at this grotto-heaven of pristine purity,
my heart finds sudden, profound peace.

**Another**
Gray-haired and weathered, a student of the Dao,
I wander mountains and rivers at leisure.
In youth, my disciples toiled diligently—
now in age, body and mind are free.

**Nothing Real to Grasp—Nature Alone Suffices**
I love to chant in the wind beneath the moon,
taking up and setting down without effort.
I know my words are all empty forms—
only when meeting a kindred spirit do I find true appreciation.

**Passing Through Wuchuan in Mid-Summer; Daoist Friends Invite Me to Stay for the Season**
I reply: At Dragon Field in the seventh month,
the hall’s beams will be raised, and melons already ripe.
Thus I compose this verse.

Wherever karmic conditions lead is my livelihood;
when merit fills the Three Thousands, flowers bear fruit.
I once promised Longyang—
the ridgepole is set, and I’ve been promised fresh melon.

**On the Strange Cypress Meditation Bench at the Residence of the Fifth Lady**
The cypress meditation bench befits the Daoist household;
our meeting is truly a fine livelihood.
All day we sit together, wordless in discourse,
each guarding purity to pass the years.

**Firmly Declining Daoist Friends’ Invitation to Longyang**
Summer at Wuchuan surpasses Longyang—
in the sixth month, the windows catch the cool breeze.
I fear leaving too soon, my work unfinished,
unable to stay and taste the fine melons.

**Retiring to a Mountain Cave—One Day, Pan Shi Bestows the Dharma Name "Master of Pure Harmony"**
Returning the letter, I offer this poem in gratitude.

I subdued my heart to study the Dao, escaping worldly demons,
resolved to cultivate truth and ascend the Great Canopy.
Thirty years of effort yet unfulfilled—
an empty title bestowed: "Pure Harmony."

**Another**
Once in Jade Clarity, I wore purple robes;
today beneath the cliff, I refuse even silk.
Let a thousand changes come—
I preserve this tranquil harmony of qi.

**Another**

**Mastering the Self to Cultivate Truth, Fewer Demons to Confront**
Mastering the self to cultivate truth, demons diminish—
from the first, one’s duty suffices to unfold the net.
Now, in my decline, a master’s title is bestowed,
shaming the immortal Zhang Zhihe.

**Another**
Coarse rice fills the belly, vanquishing demons;
tattered robes cover the body, surpassing silk.
Fleeting fame and profit breed chaos in busyness—
true conduct and merit thrive in stillness.

**Admiring the Moon After Rain in the Mountains**
Rain clears on Western Mountain, the sky serene and bright,
a flawless mirror of jade hangs in the azure expanse.
The Daoist sits through the night in rapture,
enchanted by that luminous, perfect orb.

**Another**
Rain passes on Western Mountain, the moon at its brightest—
mid-autumn’s shared delight stirs quiet feeling.
Its cold light shatters the cowardice of demons,
sleepless through the night, bone-deep clarity.

**Another**
Mountains hushed, clouds withdrawn into night’s purity,
moonlight pierces the nine heavens with limpid radiance.
It illumines the heart’s core, leaving no room for doubt—
only the stirrings of poetry and the Dao remain.

**Following the Rhyme of Duan Gong’s Poem**
A thousand mountains traversed, then ten thousand more,
yet nowhere offers a smile to greet the eye.
Only beyond the pass do mist and rosy clouds linger—
there, in the realm of emptiness and ethereal distance.

**The Hall of Mystic Contemplation West of Baoxuan Hall**
Composed in the rhyme of Duan Gong’s poem.

Alone I sit in the dark palace of Mystic Contemplation,
silent, wordless, inwardly nurturing hidden light.
One day, when the primal nature is fully cultivated,
it will shatter heaven and earth—nowhere left to hide.

**Matching the Rhyme of the Worthies’ Red Stone Poems**
Red stone, ground again and again, yields not to vermilion,
dissolving doubts, it delights in true suchness.
For it unravels the hidden meanings of the grass-script classics—
a single insight unlocks ten thousand ancient texts.

**Another**
Exquisite stone and refined gold both dwell in mountains,
yet neither can replace this substance to rejuvenate the face.
Where the jade instructions reveal their clarity,
doubts vanish in an instant.

**Lamenting the Futility of Empty Fame**
Yesterday, lowly in name, my heart knew no joy;
today, burdened with renown—what good does it bring?
People fail to grasp the sufficiency of the ordinary,
vainly courting desire, piling up karmic debt.

**On Past and Present**
What became of the ancient Daoist wind of simplicity?
Non-action, non-striving, naturally pure and harmonious.
Alas for this degenerate age, where human feelings run deep—
sowing boundless karmic demons in their wake.

**Inscribed for One Seeking a Title for a Goshawk Painting**
Spirit bright, swift, and fierce, it grazes the heavens,
subduing snares to preserve grand harmony.
Ever vigilant, never resting—
how could it let a single foe from Silla slip by?

**Entering the Gorges, Visiting Tuanshan Daoist Abbey—Inscribed in Stay**
The surging river rolls a thousand li,
jumbled peaks layer upon layer, the gorge’s gates open wide.
Its force bends and twists in endless turns,
flowing eastward—how many journeys to return?

**Another**
The two gorges rise in rugged majesty,
Tuanshan, bathed in water, a painted screen within.
This wondrous scene lies beyond the red dust—
could this be the first palace of Penglai?

**Three Poems on Seeing Daoist Friends Off at Wuchuan to Fan Mountain County**

**I**
Since parting Wuchuan, I’ve returned to Yan,
our reunion now seems fated by chance.
Already the jade halls urge haste—
how can I bear the coal dust billowing in smoke?

**II**
Only for my master’s burial in ancient Yan
do I tarry, adapting to circumstances as they come.
Cultivating truth most fears harming harmony—
nurturing nature, never let fire or smoke arise.

**III**
Snow-capped peaks gleam white, stretching south to Yan,
crossing mountains and rivers—my destined path.

**One Day Attaining the Realm of Eternal Spring,**
Incense fills the jade halls, weaving auspicious mist.

**Ten Poems Composed in Leisure on the First Day of the Gengyin Year**

**I**
Discoursing on the mysterious, debating the wondrous—words are pure,
yet intent twists, the heart wanders, turning ever unclear.
All speak of benefiting others to fulfill perfect virtue—
but when has this ever cost oneself even half a deed?

**II**
The kalpa’s decay lingers, qi not yet cleansed,
heaven reveals all goodness, distinctions growing clear.
All beings universally transform, returning to the true teaching,
the myriad forms radiant, moving in harmony with the measure.

**III**
The ten thousand sounds hush, the single qi clears,
the Three Yangs blaze, the Nine Lights shine bright.
Worldly glory and splendor are not my desire—
I cherish preserving the heart, walking in stillness.

**IV**
The inch of heart never dimmed, qi ever pure,
every thought selfless, the Dao gradually illumined.
Ten years’ journey circling the Three Realms above,
in one moment merit complete, traversing the Nine Heavens.

**V**
Beyond the world, idle chanting holds a different clarity,
the blade of wisdom honed sharp, the heart of Dao made bright.
Amid a thousand blossoms, lying robed in repose,
at the hundred-foot pole’s tip, advancing step by step.

**VI**
The supreme Dao is level, the gaze far and clear,
unobstructed in all directions, the four quarters bright.
The men of this age do not trust the path of true emptiness—
come, let us walk as companions with the idle ones.

**VII**
The immortal palace’s purple courts hold lingering purity,
the Jasper Terrace of Lang Garden—my vision is clear.
Before the Six-Six Caves, riding the phoenix past,
above the Three-Three Heavens, treading the clouds.

**VIII**
The sky, unobscured, shines resplendently clear,
the Sage Emperor and true kings—sun and moon bright.
Together we rejoice, our temples streaked with age beneath Shun’s reign,
freely roaming the land of Great Peace.

**IX**
The scenery of Eternal Spring is naturally pure,
the Western Pavilion and Eastern Terrace—four vistas bright.
Feathered guests and immortal officials pass in exchange—
disheveled topknots and parted hair come and go.

**X**
The perfected immortals of the realized Dao stand pure through ten thousand ages,
their teachings handed down to instruct the wise.
The superior person, content, sits in wordless absorption—
all day, carefree, he wanders alone.

In the gengyin year, returning from the *jiao* rites at Tongxian Abbey,
I take leave of Daoist friends, the Marshal and the Military Overseer with verse.

Long weary of the world’s ways, I loved the mountains deeply,
yet my share in the hills was meager—eastward I return.
My work incomplete, I follow fate’s turns,
still restless, never at ease.

**XI**
For days I lingered, loath to leave the Western Mountains,
yet letters summoned me back at once.
I sigh—my temples streaked with age, the years grown old,
while worldly ties still will not grant me leisure.

**XII**
A thousand *li* of mountains stretch in endless ranges,
where for years I lingered, coming and going.
No path was too rugged when I set out,
hoping to claim this peace for life.

**XIII**
In Yan, they urged me to leave Mount Jia,
a few riders lightly turning east again.
Not for the coldness of incense or white clouds,
but for the heart’s own freedom—pure and idle.

**XIV**
Range upon range, uncounted mountains,
the Daoist roams without thought of return.
Before mastering the wondrous subtleties of the Perfect Truth,
who attains the carefree ease of true leisure?

**XV**
Five quatrains newly composed to bid this mountain farewell—
when will I return after parting?
If you can cast off both movement and stillness,
everywhere you go, the mind is free—at last, at ease.

**Taking Leave of the Daoist Assembly at River and Mountain**
The sound of water, the hues of mountains—void of feeling,
yet between them, the spirit grows clear.
Not for the weight of worldly ties here,
but to recall the joy of a lifetime upon return.

**XVI**
Delighting in the Dao, forgetting schemes—this is true nature,
roaming hills and streams, the eyes grow bright.
In old age, no place of rest,
only endless wandering east and west, south and north.

**XVII**
The Mystery Teachings dispel delusion, far from worldly cares,
when worldly cares are wholly cut, the Daoist heart shines clear.
Since first arriving, little has transpired—
only to probe the mystery of life and death.

**Postscript to the *Ten Elders* Scroll**
Ten idle ones, idle and pure,
their clarity of vision keen.
I bid you sit in idleness—
what skill is honed in leisure’s midst?

**Staying at Xiantian Abbey in Fanshan for the Summer, Exhorting the Assembly**
To the southwest, war’s desolation still rages,
while here in the northeast, summer months bring cool repose.
It is fitting to practice goodness here,
cultivating virtue and burning incense of renown.

**XVIII**
The great kalpa unfolds in chaos, desolation everywhere,
yet by fortune, this place knows cool tranquility.
I urge you to redouble efforts in cultivating true blessings—
gradually, you will sense the fragrance of non-action and purity.

**XIX**
Once I followed my late master through vast wastelands,
returning, I rejoiced in this cool refuge.
While war’s clamor has not ceased, this land thrives first—
for its people are honest, their virtue fragrant.

**XX**
Each person, lost in delusion, wanders in desolation,
how can the heart find cool repose?
Pierce through the snares of the world, return beyond things—
naturally, virtue and the Dao will be fragrant.

**XXI**
Refining the nature, penetrating the true—no desolation,
let creation shift between heat and cold.
When merit is complete, ride the crane to Penglai Isle,
leaving behind a name fragrant through ten thousand ages.

**Parting from Daoist Friends at Fanshan**
Beyond things, carefree, far from worldly demons,
non-action, non-striving—preserving purity and harmony.
I have come here many times, grown familiar with the ways of men,
where reason is thoroughly explored, the good are many.

**XXII**
Embracing the One, never straying, roaming beyond things,
adrift alone, steering the great spirit-boat.
In the boundless sea of suffering, countless souls—
who will still their hearts and take the hook?

**XXIII**
Sincere words urge an early turn,
yet those who heed not sink into the Nine Dark Realms.
The Great Sage cannot lift them out—
recognize the truth now, swallow the hook.

**On the Gushing Gold Pool Behind the Hall of Xiantian Abbey**
A wooden plaque floats upon the pool’s surface,
warning all not to defile it.
Rolling, the sacred spring flows deep through the years—
let not a speck of filth intrude.

The world sees only boundless water,
but in my eyes, it is inexhaustible gold.

**Passing by Ma’s Estate in Clearwater Village near Yantai, Delayed by Rain**
The wind from Fufeng stirred the heavens,
a night of clouds birthing ceaseless rain.
All things in the west reach fruition—there is trust in this,
yet a thousand gold pieces cannot buy a single true friend.

**Expressing My Feelings**
Years of seeking the Dao—only now do I begin to succeed,
each trial of demons brings renewal.
When demons come often, the heart must not waver—
only when demons are exhausted does the single truth shine clear.

**XXIV**
The Seven Perfected cultivated virtue, moving the heavens,
their single act of mystic wind passed beyond the Jade Pass.
The *Shuidiao* song’s friends proved true,
throwing wide the gates, leaning upon Yan Mountain.

**Three Quatrains on Journeying to the Offering at Guozhou**
For a year, I dwelled in the Pavilion of Constant Contentment,
body and mind at last somewhat at ease.
The Teachings’ call made me know the difficulty of escape—
yet I did not shun the distant journey to the *jiao* feast.

**XXV**
North of the ridges, the wind is cold—an ancient truth,
through three winters, I crossed the Yanmen Pass.
The Daoist’s compassion and kindness are a treasure,
delivering the dead, mourning the living—forming good karmic ties.

**XXVI**
Briefly parting from the Hall of Compliance in Yan City,
I journeyed on my master’s behalf to other lands.
Not that I sought to cling or stir up connections—
but the *jiao* host’s sincerity could not be forgotten.

**Inscribing Ink Bamboo**
The Ink Lord paints the four seasons’ spring,
leaf upon leaf, branch upon branch—far beyond the dust.
Seizing creation’s power, wielding it in hand,
each stroke brings forth something new.

**Self-Description in the Pavilion of Constant Contentment**
In the Pavilion of Constant Contentment, mountains and seas are whole,
wind and moon accompany the passing years.
Those who seek to see me have no other words—
all call this place the Little Grotto-Heaven of Everlasting Spring.

**XXVII**
This small pavilion holds mountains and seas in full,
"Constant Contentment" its name—ease in old age.
Where better to find idleness and freedom?
Where else to seek the Gourd Heaven?

**Passing by Nanxin Village in Jin’an Prefecture, Presented to Daoist Du**
At six, he left home—ninety-one now,
the single truth shining through four, three, seven.
Today, by good fortune, deep karmic ties meet—
all dharmas forgotten, all affairs complete.

**Occasional Verses**
Gathering up the fishing rod, the hook laid aside,
all ties suddenly stilled—rest, rest.
Passions forgotten, intentions extinguished—little remains,
the other shore ascended high, no boat needed.

**XXVIII**
Not deceived by fragrant bait, not swallowing the hook,
thus attaining ease—all affairs at rest.
Rain hat and misty cloak ever companions,
the clear river calmly bears a solitary boat.

**XXIX**
Best to cast all ties aside with a single stroke,
cultivating the true must cease before death.
The vast sea of suffering—waves surge fiercely,
return, come—ah!—the boat to the shore.

**Exhortation to the Assembly**
In Tu River, through nine summers, sitting in cool clarity,
in Suiyi, through three winters, sleeping at ease.

Only ever cherishing the thought of the Dao,
cloud-wandering wherever I go, I find peace.

**Again**
Do not fret that years pass and merit remains incomplete—
one morning, when practice is fulfilled, sleep will be forgotten.
Cultivating the true is no ordinary matter:
one must recognize what is so within the so, what is not so within the not-so.

**Again**
A universal exhortation to the wise and later learners of immortality:
do not indulge in cravings or give free rein to slumber.
At all times, inquire into the Dao and virtue,
and you will realize the primordial, in accord with nature.

**Matching the Rhyme of Layman Heji Tong**
The fruits of cultivating the true are like a shuttle’s swift motion—
not empty words, yet just so.
In the place of sudden awakening and tranquil communion, free from desire,
the message within naturally harmonizes.

**Composed at Tongxian Abbey, Sent to Master Feng and His Circle in Yanshan**
A stretch of Western Mountains all belongs to Yan,
and Yanshan is fit for passing one’s remaining years.
Our gate’s disciples are inherently cultivators of the true—
come to these mountains, and you are immortals.

**Again**
Neither fragrant bait nor hook,
only an idle fishing rod set beside the boat.
Eyes meet in silence, knowing this meaning—
why labor the mouth to urge fellow travelers?

**Presented to Shi Dian on His Trial**
I have a desire for leisure to bestow upon others,
yet none possess the capacity to fully embrace the true.
One who holds jade within stone may yet preserve it—
beyond the world’s cares, a different spring unfolds.

**Passing Gaojiapu**
Within the heart of great mountains, a small hermitage—
passing through, how could I have stayed even a day?
Yet I love this grotto-heaven where none come,
and lingered far longer than intended.

**Again**

In twos and threes, small children
also know to raise their fists in proper courtesy.
Wherever good affinities align with heaven’s will,
the age of Great Peace lies not far ahead.

**Again**
Only in stillness do I glimpse the divine child—
I ask the passing traveler: when will you know?
When merits fill three thousand, the meeting comes;
when the Eight Hundred Paths are complete, the auspicious hour arrives.

**Passing Hunyuan’s Luanling Pass**
On the first day of winter’s depths, I left Fan Mountain;
in the third nine-day cold, I crossed Luanling Pass.
The gathered crowd sent me off with many sighs—
even a Daoist finds hardship here, yet smiles.

**Again**
The year has aged as I traverse the western mountains,
passing one barrier only to face another.
The cold clings to my beard, revealing my true age,
while the northern wind on my face keeps it youthful.

**Again**
In the frozen severity of nine nines, snow blankets the peaks,
just as when Han Yu crossed Lan Pass.
This procession of Daoists would make a fine painting—
snowy temples, frosted whiskers, faces grown old.

**Two Quatrains on the Small Pavilion at Yue Shen Mountain**
Before the ten-thousand-fathom peak stands a small pavilion,
where one may lie or sit with all clearly in view.
The great Dao before one’s eyes is hard to perceive—
yet all day long, carefree joy is mine.

**Again**
Before the ten-thousand-fathom peak, a thatched hut—
all day, its delights make sitting alone sweet.
If someone comes to speak of worldly affairs,
I close my eyes and remain silent until evening meditation.

**Composed on New Year’s Day in Huairen County**
Last year in Chongyi, the new year began;
today in Huairen, the old year is renewed.
After twelve more cycles of the celestial sphere,
where shall we gather again to celebrate the first month?

**Matching the Rhyme of Secretary Yilie Chen Xiuyu at Zihe Guan in Nanyang Village, Zhangzhou**
The Three Teachings share the same source, yet people differ—
if you say west is right, then east must be wrong.
Before your eyes lies the clear distinction—
once the One True is realized, the Non-Dual Palace is penetrated.

**Accepting an Invitation to Feast at Chongzhen Guan with Preceptor Liu**
First passing Yamen at the edge of the earth,
then nearing the Hu River’s end of the sky.
Now this land is once more the Central Plain—
when the four seas are harmonious, all is one family.

**Three Quatrains on Xiuye Garden in Jiaocheng County, Composed in Late Spring of the Yiwei Year to Expand Its Refinement**
Xiuye’s new city endured chaos and separation,
yet Master Qin’s fine deeds were truly extraordinary.
The garden’s flowers and trees are all uncommon,
and the children at home all compose poetry.

**Again**
In late spring, Xiuye is at its finest—
beneath the mulberry, enchanting reds are uniquely splendid.
Who can grasp both without bias?
The subtle message of perfect clarity is known by few.

**Again**
Strolling through Xiuye, I pass a sparse fence—
what meets the eye is pitiably fine, like brocade trees.
If you understand Old Wang’s intent east of the village,
then sir, do not compose poems about a hundred flowers.

**Upon Visiting Qingxu Guan in Pingyao County**
Always seeking simplicity, I long for deep mountains,
yet here I find Qingxu and a carefree old face.
Ancient cypresses stand quietly as fitting companions—
free of cares, at ease through all four seasons.

**At the Mouth of Wu’er Valley Northeast of Luzhou, Where Magistrates of Li and She Counties and Local Elders Ensure Safe Passage for Travelers and Establish a Guan to Accumulate Merit—Responding with a Poem**
Mountains stretch a thousand *li* north and south;
you stand at a vital crossroads between Li and She.
Fortunate to wield authority, you should be accommodating—
guide travelers through perilous passes.

**Presented to the Boy Zhanbao**
With unkempt hair, he steadfastly cultivates the Dao,
a fine companion for the venerable master as a young immortal.
Externally, he learns to sever the Four Appearances through affinity;
internally, he nurtures the living practice to safeguard the Three Fields.

**Declining an Invitation from Prefectural Vice-Director Zhang of Xinzhou—Responding with a Poem**
From Pingyao I briefly parted to reach Pingyang,
a single body rushing about in several places.
I constantly regret my incomplete merits, lacking transformation—
unable to universally respond to all directions.

**Composed at Hongshan’s Mingxia Guan in Jiexiu County in Late Autumn of the Yiwei Year**
Hongshan’s fine scenery, a secluded grotto-heaven,
rests above clear cliffs where waterfalls flow.
Climbing three or four *li* higher,
I stroll idly to the spring’s source when the mood strikes.

**Staying Overnight in a Earthen Cave at Lingyuan Guan in Yichang Village, Fenzhou**
A winding earthen cave offers refuge from misfortune;
in winter’s cold, I sleep late into the day.
Sometimes bandits come seeking me,
but I retreat deeper into the cave and do not emerge.

**Traveling the Roads of Taiyuan and Pingyang, Where Welcomes and Farewells Never Cease**
Spring and autumn pass on both routes as I respond to affinities—
welcomed on arrival, sent off on departure, never resting.
Human hearts do not yield like the waters of Fenyang—
they accompany me southwest to the very end.

**On Laojun Peak of Zijin Mountain in Hejin**
I come to record my journey in person—
gazing in all directions, this is a strategic pass.
The immortal realm’s purity and loftiness are renowned since antiquity—
to this day, it is called Laojun Peak.

**Passing Hejin Where the Local Gentry Request a Poem**
Vast waves encircle the mountains on three sides;
at their center, the ferry city stands between Yu and Ji.
As the Dao passes through, invitations arrive swiftly—
the entire plain’s incense fires light up with joy.

**Conversing Idly with Zhang of Xiyan**
Ask not of forests and springs, nor of mountains—
all clarity and emptiness reside within a single heart.
If you can constantly distance yourself from worldly concerns,
then distancing yourself fully is true leisure.

**Inscribed at the Hut in Xinzhang Village**
With a light body, why fear the ends of the earth?
With a tranquil nature, why worry about distant corners?
Returning from Jingzhao in mid-summer,
I find joy in this pure hut as the sun inclines.

**Responding to Yang Hanqing**
The azure firmament has a path that can indeed be climbed—
to know true leisure is no ordinary matter.
Grinding away emotions and nature to transcend the Four Appearances,
harmonizing the true breath to penetrate the Three Passes.

**Inscribed at Guanyin Pavilion in Magu Valley**
Arriving at Magu Valley in late autumn,
a stream of clouds and water marks a fine journey’s start.
Others do not understand my joy—
after the meal, I ascend the pavilion at leisure alone.

**Composing the Method of Peace and Ease for the Confucian Scholar Guo Gong**
A single point of vastness must be square and round—
nurture it directly, without self-interest, to fill the great thousand.
Transforming and coming and going beyond the Three Realms,
why worry that at sixty you cannot prolong your years?

**Climbing the High Mountain Ahead**
The ends of the earth lie before me—
this high peak ahead could be painted and passed down.
If someone asks my name,
I am but one of countless immortals among the pines.

**Upon Gaining the High Mountain Ahead, Written at the Request of the Gathered Officials and Sent to Them**
Now I have gained the high peak west of Guo—
the dense pines and cliffs are beyond counting.
From youth, I always admired the joy of mountain life;
in old age, this leisurely dwelling is most fitting.

**Three Poems on Retirement Sent to Daoist Companions in Yanshan**
The heart retires, and years have passed accordingly—
now both heart and body are fully retired.

Profound and wondrous, beyond all discourse,
pure and clear, in perfect accord with nature.

**Again**
Following the teachings and practicing causes for decades,
the abbeys of Yanshan are now nearly complete.
Twice summoned to Zhongnan—all by heaven’s will—
returning now, all affairs are settled.

**Again**
Thirty years of studying the Dao under masters,
yet my merit remains incomplete, still imperfect.
Through a thousand perils on the world’s stormy paths,
who understands the serenity within my heart?

**Admonition to the Assembly**
The wind in the pines enters the ear, dullness fades;
worldly affairs weigh on the mind, turbidity and chaos multiply.
Fortunate to encounter this pure and secluded grotto-heaven,
I urge you: do not indulge the demon of slumber.

**Again**
Ask not whether cultivation is shallow or deep—
the Daoist’s shadow is the Daoist’s heart.
Since you already discern the principles so clearly,
how lamentable to waste time in reckless frivolity.

**Sent to Horse Steward Ma of Pingyao County**
Old Master Ma, recognizing what lies ahead,
has seen through the world—now it is time to rest.
Turn instead to long-term plans in Tai Ping,
passing spring and autumn with leisurely companions.

**A Quatrain Composed for the Attendant Holding the Baton at Changchun Abbey, Whose Horse Was Halted by Snow at the Foot of the High Mountain Ahead**
In the profound clarity of the void, no words are set forth,
yet one’s bearing should remain impartial.
From a thousand miles away you came to visit,
but snow blocks the mountain gate—your horse cannot advance.

**Inscribed During Days of Snow Play at the High Mountain Ahead**
The snow falls ceaselessly, misty and dense,
even the green pines and cypresses seem burdened with sorrow.
Further troubled by urgent letters arriving from the east,
overnight, the green mountains have turned entirely white.

**Three Quatrains Composed While Resting at Tortoise Mountain in Qincheng**
At Tongchuan, I already found cause to smile—
the whole prefecture’s people find respite among mountains and waters.
Yet there are still more refined and delightful places to admire;
when the mood strikes, I stroll leisurely up Tortoise Mountain.

**Again**
From Tortoise Mountain’s heights, the four directions lie clear,
seeing through the world’s affairs brings joy to the heart.
Fortunate now to have found this cool and refreshing place,
I only wish all regions might soon know great peace.

**Again**
Each time I ascend Tortoise Mountain and gaze in all directions,
where in the four quarters is there no desolation?
From now on, awakened to the world of mortals,
even in the scorching heat, my heart remains cool.

**In Leisure**
The body’s nature is empty and mysterious, responsive where it connects;
when it can respond, it becomes luminous and clear.
Nurturing luminosity reveals the wondrous within the void—
the wondrous body is true emptiness, yet not empty.

**Again**
To cultivate the real, one must grasp the lineage of ancestors;
the ancestors manifest their sacred power at all times.
If you ask where the ancestors reside,
they are in the luminous and articulate nature.

**Again**
In silent realization, recognize the ancestors—
the fine traditions of Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma.
Disciples of this lineage, heed my counsel:
exert yourselves diligently in cultivation to the very end.

**Mid-Autumn of the Ding-You Year, Sent to the Daoist Assembly in Yanshan from Qincheng**
Three autumns have passed since I left Yanshan,
now the ten-thousand-fathom waves have reached the shore.
I thank the many perfected ones for their compassion toward my age—
the rice and wheat of Tongchuan surpass those of other regions.

**A Quatrain Composed Upon Reading Su Shi’s Inscription on a Wall**
The Daoist, steadfast, drinks three cups of wine;
the Chan monk, drowsy, sleeps through a nap.
Seeming so yet not so—who can discern?
I urge you: do not heed the words of the secular world.

**For Horse Steward Ma**
Before I speak, others already see my aged appearance;
upon meeting, they first declare my virtue and power to be lofty.
An empty chamber is best for constant ease—
with a heart like cold ashes, let not even a thread remain.

**Parting from Wine Officer Li of Pingyao County on the Double Fifth Festival**
My body, serene and free, comes and goes as it pleases,
though the world’s俗人 may harbor suspicions.
On this Double Fifth, leaving the immortal’s abbey,
the sunflowers by the railing have yet to bloom.

**Reply to the Invitation from Daming Prefecture, Unable to Attend Due to Illness on the Road**
Once I heard of my master enduring tribulations,
now the transmission has passed to aged Qinghe.
Ahead lie boundless realms of true wandering—
incomplete merit does not permit me to see them.

**For Immortal Ox**
To study the Dao, one must rely on keen insight;
when encountering demons, do not retreat—turn instead to firmness.
If you can awaken to the truth of no birth and no extinction,
you will be spared another passage through the human world.

**Thirty Years of Leisure in Weiyang, at the Pure and Secluded Hermitage—Now, at Seventy, Having Led the Assembly to Raise Funds, I Have Returned to the Origin**
For thirty years in Weiyang, I set aside profound discourse;
now, at seventy, I have ceased such talk.
In stillness, I recall the true leisure of those days—
it was just like the Pure and Secluded Hermitage of old.

**Daoist Liu Zhixi Presents Carved Wooden Statues of the Seven Perfected**
A single point of numinous light, truly efficacious,
penetrating the subtleties of all wonders, it naturally connects with the divine.
If you can further awaken to the wondrousness of the primordial origin,
you will carve forth the formless body that has always been.

**Daoist Abbey of Five-Flower Mountain**
Five-Flower’s true essence lies in forests and springs,
myriad towering trees bordering the water’s source.
I ask those who come and go on their travels:
how many mountain abbeys are as complete as this?

**Again**
At Five-Flower, all who see it break into smiles—
walking the level path, one finds it is already a mountain.
The abbey’s purity and seclusion are a realm of immortals;
in the stillness of forests and springs, it surpasses the human world.

**Again**
Above the Jade Lotus Pond stands the Jade Lotus Pavilion,
facing the water, overlooking the mountain, the view is clear.
Having wandered through the world, my plans for return come late—
Five-Flower Mountain is fitting to spend my remaining years.

**Five Quatrains on Visiting Five-Flower Mountain, in Reply to Wang Zizheng**
Following the master’s summons, I rose from Weila,
the teachings unfolded step by step in Yanshan.
Where once I refined elixirs and cultivated the self,
today, a leisurely visitor, I have returned again.

**Again**
Stem by stem, green lotuses emerge from the square pond,
just lacking Tao Yuanming’s golden chrysanthemum hedge.
In the height of summer, the fragrance of cultivation gradually unfolds—
waiting for the Double Ninth is not too late.

**Again**
Five-Flower has transformed again, like a Penglai palace,
a scene of pure coolness filling the eye.
Heaven has granted this old body leisure and ease—
by Five-Flower Pond, what a joyous wind!

**Again**
Who has mastered the inner cloud-wandering,
roaming the eight directions without a care?
In this realm of purity and stillness lies an inexhaustible treasury—
I ask you: where is the end of the journey?

**Again**
Having exhausted human sentiments, one sees the sentiment of the Dao,
yet the sentiment of the Dao is still a forced name.
If one can awaken to the wondrousness of no birth,
they will transcend Nan Hua and Chi Cheng.

**Five-Character Regulated Verse**
**In Praise of the Scripture of Purity and Stillness**
The three powers, pure and still in principle,
those who know awaken to true feeling.
Supreme virtue is fundamentally without self;
the ignorant fundamentally delight in contention.
Serene, it leaves behind what it illuminates;
in responding to things, it becomes ever clearer.
How does one enter the utmost wondrousness?
In utter constancy, the nature is naturally at peace.

**On the Insufficiency of Precepts**
With clothes, one can ward off the cold;
with food, one can fill the stomach.
If either of these two is lacking,
a person’s heart and mind will be askew.

Just as when clothing and food are sufficient,
one still indulges in greed and delusion.
Suddenly, when karmic deeds reach their fullness,
at the brink of danger, whom else can one blame?

**Composed in the Hall of Accord on an Autumn Mid-Autumn Night**
In the Hall of Accord, the mid-autumn stillness,
cloud companions add to the harmonious qi.
Demon spirits lurk at the sea’s edge,
while the bright moon emerges from the mountain’s peak.
All nations share in joyful admiration,
a thousand gates together gaze in delight.
Sitting through the night in mutual regard,
all feel their natures at peace and serene.

**Composed at the Precelestial Abbey on Mount Fan**
Arriving first, there was still intent,
but clouds and waters were already without mind.
Hiding one’s traces only seeks remoteness,
burying one’s name still feels insufficiently deep.
Autumn’s sun bids farewell to dear friends,
spring’s warmth seeks out kindred spirits.
Longing for the stillness of Western Mountain,
to spare oneself the intrusion of worldly affairs.

**Further Verse**
Abiding in the Dao, one forgets worldly burdens,
dwelling in peace, one admires virtuous neighbors.
Among those seated, no vulgar guests,
on the mat, only lofty persons.
Cultivating qi like a tortoise’s breath,
refining form like weathered stone.
Seeking the true and real appearance,
recognizing one’s original body.

**Wood Frost Descends at the Autumn Sun Abbey on the First Full Moon of the Yiyou Year**
Willows hang a thousand strands of white,
lanterns blaze ten thousand hues of red.
Heaven displays its wondrous signs,
earth reveals its divine craft.
Jade blossoms bloom on emerald trees,
verdant hills transform into hoary elders.
All grasses and trees upon the cliffs
turn to crystalline jade.

**From the Sixth Month of Yiyou to the Fourth Month of Bingxu, No Rain—Composed at the Dragon Sun Abbey Beyond the Mountains**
Autumn lacked even three inches of rain,
spring brought winds in full measure.
Winter’s snow was too meager,
how could summer’s seedlings flourish?
Never once did I seek my own faults,
only blamed the gods’ lack of merit.
Though I have departed for the Western Pass,
I still lament the year’s impoverished reckoning.

**Parting from Elder Longxi After Twenty Years—Though We Knew Each Other Before, Our Hearts Had Not Yet Met; Now in Conversation, I Know His Mind. Together We Journey to Western Mountain, Hence This Record.**
Once we met in former days,
today we speak from the heart.
Together we vow to go to Western Mountain,
climbing Northern Ridge to chant.
Carefree, we leave the capital’s markets,
unfettered, we enter the mountain forests.
Myriad layered peaks stretch far,
each step ahead grows deeper.

**Upon Repeated Petitions, Bestowed with the Title "Perfected"**
By chance, a five-character verse—
a long sigh.
For admiring the conduct of a perfected one,
others call me "Perfected."
If true attainment were indeed sufficient,
why fear not attaining long spring?
Studying the Dao is no empty delusion,
cultivating truth relies on real causes.
Ever like the resolve of the Seven Patriarchs,
how could karmic response fail one?

**Poem Presented to Master Wang in Illness**
The ancient Dao could still be grasped,
in this age, it may yet be understood.
Cultivating truth must seek the wondrous,
health and peace come from harmony and balance.
When the dharma is exhausted, the body lightly ascends,
when the elixir is absent, the form grows frail.
The original perfect image appears,
not permitting a single speck of dust to obscure it.

**Inscribed at Southern Hermitage**
Strolling to Southern Hermitage,
where Southern Hermitage best suits the heart.
Before the gate, the stream flows green,
beyond the window, bamboo winds are clear.
Amid peril, one ever knows contentment,
forgetting greed, all contention ceases.
Simply because the body is at ease,
a single piece of the Dao-heart shines bright.

**Wood Forest Elder, Long Ill, Completes the Lower Prime Offering in the Xinmao Year**
Though this illusory body has long been sick,
devotion to the Dao grows ever more sincere.
The Yellow Register reaches the nether realms,
the Red Writ ascends to Supreme Purity.
Lost souls rejoice in salvation,
living beings celebrate completion.
The utmost Dao is not by breadth attained—
how then to transcend life and death?

**Elegy for the Departed Wood Forest Elder**
You have returned to truth and gone,
I now come for you.
Beyond a decade of knowing hearts,
two years as companions, now you return.
After coming, the body is like a dream,
at departure, fire turns to ash.
Life and death are but common principles—
why grieve so bitterly?

**At the Divine Clarity Abbey in Guozhou—Judicial Officer Zhuang, a Man of the Dao, Discoursing on the Mysteries, Hence These Words to Inspire Him**
Entering the night to discourse on the mysterious teaching,
divine clarity sits through the second watch.
Within the gate, no Liezi is found,
beneath the mat, Zhuangzi appears.
With nature still, dust cannot stain,
with mind open, conduct easily succeeds.
Able to fathom the meaning beyond form,
a single piece of the Dao-heart shines bright.

**Rejoicing in Rain at Five Flower Mountain**
The fourth month’s winds have just stilled,
Five Flower Mountain’s rains are abundant.
All beings rejoice together,
I too preserve my peaceful dwelling.
Summer’s planting nears completion,
autumn’s harvest will not be in vain.
In coming and going, playful delight,
at times riding a small cloud chariot.

**In the Jihai Year, the Fourth Month—Seven Days of Gloom, Only Then Did the Sun and Moon’s Light Appear**
The fourth month’s yang was just strong,
when suddenly yin qi arose.
Heaven and earth grew dim in confusion,
ghosts and spirits were startled and grim.
Seven days like primordial chaos,
the great yin refused to clear.
One morning, clouds and mist gathered,
sun and moon shone as one.

**Reply to Wang Zizheng**
Fortunately encountering the true dharma,
this is the depth of past roots.
Do not follow the traces of ancient ones,
only search your own heart.
Before your eyes, it is easily seen,
beyond the body, it is hard to find.
A single word of purity suffices—
worth more than ten thousand measures of gold.

**Five-Character Extended Verse**
**Xinmao Year—Passing Through Jingzhou on the Eastern Salt Fields Offering, Presented to the Eastern Daoist Assembly**
Not to go to Western Mountain,
heaven bids me journey east.
With mind empty, ever in accord with the Dao,
with nature eccentric, not yet fully bright.
Observing the wondrous, entering formlessness,
pursuing the edge, bound to emotion.
Cultivating true virtue in Quanzhen,
clinging to falsity, enamored of empty fame.
Seeing form as empty form,
hearing sound, awakening to silent sound.
In movement, nothing lacking,
in stillness, clarity remains.
Indulging desire, the Dao is hard to awaken to,
gathering the heart, conduct easily succeeds.
This illusory body is fundamentally false,
the true nature originally at peace.
Seek not the lead and mercury method,
cease letting smoke and fire arise.
Heed this bitter admonition together,
another fine future lies ahead.

**Sent from the Capital to the Daoist Assembly at Eternal Spring Abbey**
Departing the capital for fifty days,
writing a hundred thousand sheets.
Believers fill the outskirts to greet,
incense smoke perfumes the road.
Everywhere, the Dao’s transformation spreads,
no place is not a land of immortals.
Refining nature, penetrating the three realms,
fame gallops across the ten directions.
With intent to dwell in stillness,
without desire for renown.
Practicing the Dao follows the master’s teaching,
establishing oneself must be through personal strength.
The people at peace, the path of goodness is cultivated,
the nation at peace, scriptures are chanted.
Answering destiny, no high or low,
following conditions, no short or long.
The Seven Perfected opened the true teaching,
the myriad sages assist the enlightened king.

**Rejoicing in the Restoration of Five Flowers Abbey**

Movement and stillness follow Heaven’s will,
yet nowhere to conceal oneself remains.

**Inscribed with Joy at the Restoration of Five Flowers Abbey**
Once a furnace for alchemical fires,
now a hermitage for nurturing age.
I love the mountains not for their scenery,
I yearn for stillness, not out of greed.
The waters and clouds of the four seas settle,
the plans for Five Flowers find their place.
Gathering firewood north of the wall’s foot,
drawing water south of the stove’s head.
Eating porridge warms the whole body,
sipping tea sweetens the mouth.
With oneness, delusions depart,
what need is there to seek myriad methods?
No guests are welcomed or seen off,
no visitors, no idle talk.
Let others find it strange—I
rejoice in the mercy of old age.

**In Reply to a Letter from Zhou of Mount Gehong**

Since parting in ancient Yan,
I rode eastward into the mountains.
Intending to seek Wang Lie,
yet no chance to meet Ge Hong.
Your letter tells of reclusion,
your departure marks your path.
Refining nature beneath green pines,
dwelling in truth amid the azure vault.
Cultivating the body of a noble scholar,
nurturing the demeanor of a realized one.
One day, when merit is complete,
you shall transform like bamboo into a dragon.

**Cloud-Resting Abbey at Mount Pan**

The path to Mount Pan is not deep,
the abbey lies at its heart.
A valley’s stream flows gently,
pines blanket the mountain in shade.
Before the hut, hair is loosened in ease,
on the pavilion, robes are opened in stillness.
Feathered guests pound herbs at dawn,
recluses play the zither by night.
Clouds arise, enhancing auspicious scenes,
the wind stirs, turning to pure sound.
This place holds the joy of the Perfect Real,
I know it surpasses ten thousand gold.

**Quatrains**

**After Years Apart, Meeting Duan the Daoist Recorder**
At last we meet after years apart,
perusing the verses of fellow seekers, I match the rhyme with two quatrains.

Seek not the scenes of the dusty world,
but the spring beyond its bounds.
Embodying radiance, great virtue forms,
words spoken startle all who hear.

**Again**
Just as when we first parted,
we meet again after several springs.
My heart brims with wind and moon,
entrusted to those who understand.

**Ten Admonitions for the World from Eternal Spring Abbey**

**I**
The kalpa’s yin and yang unfold,
heaven’s disasters are self-invited.
With a heart ever auspicious and good,
a hundred misfortunes silently vanish.

**II**
Nature upright, words are direct;
mind biased, speech distorts itself.
Right and wrong are self-determined—
what use are others’ judgments?

**III**
A level heart holds little hate or love,
a crooked will breeds endless strife.
Pursuing evil sinks one in dark realms,
returning to truth dwells in Great Luo.

the foolish are mired in desire.

Deceit forges hell,
equanimity is heaven.

enlightenment reveals the Three Pure Ones.

**VIII**
A heart muddied in every way,
yet every phrase is pure.
Gaining power, one oppresses others heavily;
losing it, misfortune is not light.

**IX**
Calming the spirit, one knows the Dao’s vastness,
cutting off thought, the body feels empty.
Having seen the primal wonder,
wisdom’s light pervades all.

**X**
The three elixir fields hold true treasure,
the four seas know its fame.
Our Dao meets its time after a thousand years,
the First Master journeyed ten thousand miles.

**Inscribed on a Screen of Mountain, Water, and Stone**

Wondrous being communicates with the divine,
emptiness contains the utmost numen.
Knowing heaven and earth’s beginning,
the primordial qi shapes itself.

**Admonitions on Encountering Demons**

**I**
Facing demons, thoughts remain unmoved,
confronting matters, the heart is easily at peace.

cherish every moment.

**II**
Heavenly demons cannot alter resolve,
worldly affairs easily weary the heart.
I urge my disciples again and again—
cherish every moment.

I urge my disciples again and again—
cherish every moment.

**V**
Repelling demons relies on wisdom,
eradicating the self employs no-mind.
I urge my disciples again and again—
cherish every moment.

**VI**
A thousand demons lack defiled conduct,
a hundred refinements purge the mundane heart.
I urge my disciples again and again—
cherish every moment.

**Three Quatrains Sent to Wang Zizheng from Five Flowers Mountain**

**I**
Before dawn, I pledged to the Three Isles,
now I rejoice in Five Flowers’ spring.
Though near the human world,
fortunately, I have already left the dust.

**II**
In later years, I know time is short,
each day I bid farewell to eternal spring.
You instruct me to leave the three poisons—
I should depart the six realms of dust.

**III**
Five Flowers Abbey is not enough.

**The Four Seasons All Like Spring**
Year-round, spring’s embrace remains.
All day I sit in carefree ease—
not a speck of dust remains.

**Ancient Tune: A Poem**
*Traveling with Daoist Friends to Great Mountain Temple*

Mountains layer upon mountains,
rivers wind in endless bends.
Daoist friends invite me up the peak—
two or three cloud-kissed huts stand there,
and every face in our midst beams with joy.

**Passing Jin Shrine on the Qingming of Yiwei Year**
Now Taiyuan, once Taiyuan,
past and present blur into obscurity.
Only the waters before Jin Shrine’s temple
flow clear and deep, untouched by time.

**Sending Bean Congee to Daoist Companions in Yanjing**
Bitter greens soften,
adzuki congee thins—
two flavors I’ve always favored,
one truth brings eternal peace.
After eating, the four elements harmonize;
when sated, the six spirits leap with joy.
In old age, such simple pleasures suffice—
worldly affairs fade entirely away.

**Recorded Sayings**
*Instructions to Disciples by the Heavenly Perfected Daoist*

The teaching of the Perfect Realization (Quanzhen) school centers on the subtleties of nature, life, and virtue. Yet most scholars today fail to investigate their unity. For thirty years, I received oral transmissions and heart-to-heart teachings from the realized masters Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—countless profound words on daily transgressions and blessings. Though I grasp the principles, my true practice and conduct often fall short, making it difficult to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood.

Now, Lord Longxi, who has long been devoted to the Dao, has unexpectedly joined us. He earnestly seeks the subtle teachings I received from my masters, wishing to apply them himself and instruct later learners. Reluctantly, I set down a few points.

The Dao is never far from humanity—it is people who distance themselves from it. Many recognize that the Dao, Buddha-nature, and life are one, yet differences abound. They do not realize that practice inherently possesses wondrous nature, entirely free from attachment. Wisdom and life support each other, aiding the true stability of one’s nature, entering the unobstructed Dharma gate, merging into true oneness, forever transcending birth and death. Attaining spiritual freedom and self-mastery, one sees immediate proof—this is the wondrous Dao.

If a practitioner’s resolve is firm yet enlightenment remains elusive, it is due to past deficiencies in merit. Those who remain single-minded to the point of death and rebirth will emerge as enlightened beings. The sages will not overlook them; a gentle nudge opens the heart, and the Dao becomes effortless.

The master said: To understand the myriad dharmas, one must also not cling to them. Free from clinging, all dharmas are empty in form. Clinging to dharmas is grasping at the finger; not clinging is knowing where the finger points. Knowing where it points, one sees that all dharmas are empty. With this clarity, one becomes unbound and free, a person of few words who preserves life.

Further, acting upon the world with transformative power—decisive, bold, unstained, unattached—inner and outer merge in harmony. Accumulating merit and cultivating conduct day and night, even if one does not ascend in flight, one becomes extraordinary, a person of insight and courage, meeting all things with no-mind. Those quick-witted with eloquent speech may not grasp this; they are difficult to guide.

To advance on the path, one must not waste time before death—every moment is precious. As a Dao seeker, you must penetrate to the ultimate reality. Do not neglect the teachings of masters and friends. Even if you are enlightened, refine your practice through mutual inquiry until results appear. Only then can you stand alone without change and traverse all without exhaustion.

Here, I briefly record these matters—subtle teachings imparted to me by realized masters. I humbly hope that those of shared aspiration will practice together and cross to the other shore.

**Direct Words**
*Addressed to the Daoist Community of Chongyang Abbey and Youde Abbey*

The karmic affinity with this ancestral court is no small matter—it differs from other places. This is where heaven permits the assembly of sages to propagate the teachings, the foundational site of our school. Those within its fold must revive and rebuild it with true practice, sincere devotion, and unwavering resolve when faced with demonic obstacles.

Only through single-minded accumulation of merit and conduct can this land be purified. Daoists who grasp this truth find that one unit of merit here equals ten elsewhere—so too with all endeavors. If the merit is great, it need not be known by me; may the assembled sages recognize it. If the sages truly send me to inspect your progress, your earnest requests will bring me. But if merit is scarce and transgressions many, calamity will strike—no small matter.

Now, I return with these truthful words to announce to the Daoist communities of Chongyang Abbey and Youde Abbey. Let all take heed. I earnestly hope that those with Daoist aspirations will carefully consider these words—they deeply benefit you. Do not doubt; proceed with sincerity and begin at once. Do not delay. The perfected ones will never fail you.

**Seven-Character Quatrain**
*As Chongyang Festival Nears, Yuan the Perfected Gathers at Five Flowers Abbey—A Poem for Him*

Though Five Flowers blooms with spring’s splendor,
nothing compares to idle wandering in the ninth month.
A thousand trees blaze in autumn hues, mountains like brocade—
immortals gather here, a lesser Penglai.

**Sent to Duan Zhenqing and Others**
A myriad golden lotuses bear fruit as one,
Five Flowers in late autumn is just the time.
This rare gathering of yang’s radiance is hard to encounter—
tell the cloud-bound friends to come early.

**Reply to Wang Zizheng**
Why rest the heart, then rest the brush?
Seeing through all, emotions return to primordial purity.
Grasping the unobstructed in the sutras,
the heart-ground naturally becomes clear and empty.

**End of the First Volume of *Preserving the Light Collection***

**Twenty-Five Lyrics to the Tune of "Moon over the West River"**
*Composed by Perfected Qinghe, Yin Zhiping, at Autumn Yang Abbey*

**I**
I love Autumn Yang’s secluded ground,
where pines and cliffs see few passersby.
No need for seated meditation—naturally the mind forgets its schemes,
stupefied and blissful as if drunk.

Above the seat, mountains and waters;
within the heart, no right, no wrong.
Day after day, white clouds drift past—
here one may linger, content and at ease.

**II**
I love the grandeur of West Cliff,
its linked peaks rich with fertile soil.
Green pines and willows sway in tender grace,
and rare blooms, exotic herbs abound.

Spring waters murmur in a gentle stream,
Autumn Yang blazes with radiant light.
No need to climb a ladder to heaven—
this is the very scene of immortals’ realms.

**III**
I love Autumn Yang’s Daoist throng,
each one modest, gentle, and warm.
All day they roam in joyous song,
their daily lives free of self and other.

Dwelling at ease in this blessed land,
strolling through pines amid mist and vines,
putting others first, their merit grows—
forever spared from misfortune and harm.

**IV**
I love West Cliff’s beauty,
where the immortal garden stirs with triple yang.
The mountain’s form coils like a sleeping dragon—
this alone is heaven on earth.

Cloud-kissed huts and thatched cottages nestle close,
immortal blossoms and rare fruits perfume the air.
When worldly visitors arrive, they find cool serenity—
raising their hands, they cannot but gaze in awe.

**V**
I love Autumn Yang’s weather,
where a single finger points the cloud-path clear.
Why seek Cao Xi beyond the body?
Here the three bodies and four wisdoms are fully seen.

Ask not of heaven’s profound mysteries,
nor chase the effortless Great Dao.

**Before one’s eyes, recognizing these few things—**
this is the true lineage of the Quanzhen.

**At Longyang Abbey on the Winter Solstice**
The moon’s radiance illumines the four seas,
Dragon Yang’s qi fills the Three Fields.
A single thunderclap shakes mountains and rivers,
bursting forth with flashing lightning.

Dharma rain ever falls on the virtuous,
compassion clouds spread boundlessly.
Only now is the Great Peace revealed—
fulfilling my lifelong vow.

**II**
Heaven’s immortals know no confusion,
but in the world, natures remain stubbornly dull.
Fortunate are those within our gates who study the scriptures—
their dharma-nature shines forth in awakening.

Understanding principle, they grasp wondrous being;
observing emptiness, their bodies merge with the void.
Wisdom pierces the numinous treasure, returning to the primordial—
who comprehends that none are saved without the teachings?

**III**
To advance in the Dao, rely on steadfast resolve;
guard the heart, never wander recklessly.
Hear my earnest counsel, fellow seekers—
do not wait until your hair turns white with procrastination.

Green locks and rosy cheeks fade swiftly,
youth and daylight cannot be detained.
How much better to swiftly awaken and turn back—
recognize these faithful words of guidance.

**IV**
Behind the mountains, the abbey is restored,
while south of Yan, war still rages.
The Daoist’s merit and conduct have long accumulated—
spared from misfortune and harm.

Each day, recite scriptures to bless the realm;
throughout the morning, chant the Dao to subdue demons.
Fortune arises, calamity vanishes—nurturing harmony,
truly still, truly pure, attaining the fruit.

**Returning to the Mountains**
Written in Tianchang during the height of summer,
returning to the mountains just as autumn arrives.

For nine summers, Tianchang’s heat was oppressive;
behind the mountains, autumn brings coolness.
A valley of ripening millet stretches green—
the western harvest is in sight.

No matter how distant the ends of the earth,
or how desolate the lands beyond the passes,
if all is well before your eyes, it is an immortal realm—
let your heart follow conditions and be at ease.

**II**
Do not envy the clamor of the capital’s markets,
nor shun the simplicity of a mountain home.
The cries of apes and cranes only deepen one’s joy—
a heart at peace is priceless.

By night, companions are the pure wind and bright moon;
at dawn, one gazes upon green pines and rosy clouds.
With disheveled hair and a topknot, this is my life—
worthy of being painted on a secluded screen.

**III**
Beyond the window, mountains stretch like a painting;
before the gate, flowing water is fit to hear.
This secluded cave-heaven sees few travelers—
it is no path of the dusty world.

Seizing the wind and moon in stillness,
far removed from the world’s bustling affairs.
Serene, the six senses rest in tranquility—
freely singing, freely chanting.

**IV**
Within the moon, the golden crow heralds dawn;
at midday, the jade hare sleeps.
Who knows the myriad dharmas are inverted—
this principle is neither deep nor shallow.

Recognizing this primordial thing,
one must understand the true Chan of no-affair.
Every person possesses a nature that is whole and perfect—
only because they fail to turn it.

**V**
Superficial sight brings knowledge and discernment;
profound insight brings no awakening, no delusion.
Suddenly realizing, one enters the level and rare—
this is the true wisdom of a man.

Is the Dao far from the square inch of the heart?
Where in the western heavens is the bright mind?
All day, sitting in leisure, pondering deeply—
once the mechanism turns, it is done.

**VI**
With desire, one struggles to transcend old age and sickness;
without emotion, the face easily retains its youth.
An empty mind and full belly settle the six spirits—
each step is cool, reaching the other shore.

Nine years can dissolve the four marks;
ten years will surely arrive at the Three Mountains.
Roam freely through Penglai and Langye—
spared from the world’s cycle of rebirth.

**For Daoist Tian**
In movement, do not let the nature move;
in stillness, never let the heart doubt.
Before your eyes, all is upright, without obstruction—
true stillness, true purity—this is it.

Qi fills the Three Fields, naturally full;
the spirit penetrates the eight meridians, then you will know.
Suddenly realizing, one enters non-action—
everywhere, the heart rests in stability.

**For the Assembly of Ten Thousand Lotuses**
In every matter, familiarity brings contentment;
letting go of each thing, the body feels light.
The primordial point must be perfected—
wondrous words and profound speech are worth hearing.

Indulging the will, one forgets the self;
gathering the heart, one becomes aware of ignorance.
When ignorance is extinguished and worldly passions cease—
this is recognizing the mind and seeing the nature.

**The Path into West Mountain**
Stone steps and cloud ladders—treacherous paths,
grasping vines and creepers—difficult to traverse.
Deep within the cave-heaven, water and mountains gleam—
far removed from the dusty world’s sights and sounds.

In an earthen cave, sleep is peaceful, sitting is steady;
amid pine cliffs, the ears are quiet, the heart is clear.
No need to envy Xu You’s fame—
this is transcending the ordinary and entering the sacred.

**II**
Not for love of green mountains and emerald waters,
but to conceal my traces and bury my name.
Coarse robes and simple food, cutting off worldly ties—
cultivating the primordial root.

Qi congeals, spirit solidifies—long life;
an empty mind and full belly—immortality.
One day, when merit is complete, the Three Pure Ones appear—
this is the true nature of a man.

**Exhorting the Assembly to Reduce Sleep**
In summer, diligently cultivate the precious hall;
in winter, refine the stubborn heart.
At the third watch, do not yield to the sleep demon—
this is the master’s precept.

Study the Dao, do not be deluded by false thoughts;
cultivate the truth, do not lose the monastic community.
When the merit of non-action is complete, freely sing—
resting at ease, sleeping soundly.

**Contentment Brings Joy**
All day, gazing at mountains and playing by waters,
throughout the day, the heart rests in contentment.
In old age, what more is there to seek?
Preserving my yang for ninety-nine years.

Fortunate to be human and comprehend the Dao—
within the Dao, there is another return.
When merit is complete, cloud-stepping to view Yingzhou—
an eternal name, undying.

**For Master Zhang**
Daily, tending the stove’s flame on the turtle’s head,
timely, extinguishing the smoke within the chimney.
From beginning to end, unwavering in single-minded devotion—
better than endlessly coming and going.

Laying down the tangled affairs of the world,
clearly understanding the bright and luminous profound words.
One day, when merit is complete and the spirit is perfected—
selected for Penglai.

**To Daoist Friends in the Capital**
Only because merit was lacking and conduct incomplete,
am I thus compelled to wander east and west.
Since parting two years ago,
the road has turned, the wind and dust stretch for ten thousand miles.

My words are sent to the assembly in Yanshan—
hear my earnest exhortation, do not doubt.
Though external conditions may intrude, forget the mechanism within—
avoid future regrets.

**II**
Though worldly affairs have long wearied me,
how can a Daoist bear to return empty-handed?
Without diligence and hardship, reaching the western passes,
how could one attend Chongyang’s celebration?

I tell the aspirants within our gates—
the ancestral court’s roots are already visible.
The beauty of Zhongnan Mountain is wondrous in all ages—
the elderly may plan to stay long.

**For the Confucian Scholar Wang Zizheng**
The original nature is fundamentally empty and non-dual—
why then are emotions and desires entangled?

One who can suddenly awaken to the Daoist life
sees worldly affairs clearly as mere illusion.
To further penetrate its profound mysteries,
one must brush aside all pride and boasting.
Silently nurturing the spiritual sprout with inner light—
this is the work of non-action and transformation.

**Nineteen Poems from the Clouds of Mount Wu**
*Composed at Qiuyang Abbey*

Nineteen immortal disciples,
following their master through the eight wilds.
Westward to the great city walls of the Huihe,
everywhere beholding fields and mulberries.
One kind of sacred melon, most sweet—
how many in the Red Dust know its taste?
Across the boundless sands of the great chiliocosm,
the crane-drawn chariot returns east again.

**II**
Three years turned in the northern frontier,
ten thousand miles traversed to the western skies.
Light as clouds, the chariot drifts eastward—
all faces brighten with joy.
Virtue towering, merits vast,
practice perfected, one transcends the Three Realms.
When the immortals of the ten directions fulfill their work,
they witness the advent of the Great Peace.

**III**
When the Supreme descended at the Pass,
our lineage received the Dao.
Seven warlords clashed with spears and halberds—
where could compassion arise?
Only when journeying to the Western Heaven to propagate the teaching,
the Great Dharma resounded throughout the world.
Past and present, all alike—
thus the Daoist wind is revealed.

**IV**
A cultivator by the Northern Sea,
a free spirit in the Western Crags.
Parting from his master, he crosses distant passes and fords,
beyond the dust, untouched by worldly filth.
To learn the Dao, one must be resolute—
a heart of true iron, unyielding.
After nine years of practice perfected, he steps upon clouds and mist,
the Three Isles become his home.

**V**
The candle of nature pierces the heavenly eye,
the lamp of mind radiates wisdom’s light.
Serene and luminous, the numinous essence abides in constancy—
nowhere is it not round or square.
Unattached to worldly glory and splendor,
all actions accord with convenience and ease.
When merit is complete, he transforms into clouds and returns,
alone ascending to the Jasper Pool.

**Sent to the Daoist Assembly at Tianchang**

Spring nears its end beyond the mountains,
the scenery of Longyang grows ever fair.
In the eastern garden, plantains bloom—
each follows its allotted life.
Daoist companions, steadfast in resolve,
meet often with bowed heads in reverence.
Naturally serene, harmonious, and peaceful,
beyond the world, there is pure clarity.

**Staff in Hand, Ascending Chanfang Mountain**

A carefree guest of the Three Mountains,
a wanderer at ease through the four seas.
Alone, he arrives everywhere, preserving his true self—
wind and moon are his eternal neighbors.
Seeing through the emptiness of fleeting glory,
who would envy the horses and carriages of the clouds?
A single staff surpasses dragon-drawn chariots—
with steady steps, he climbs the lofty peaks.

**Composed at Xiantian Abbey**

Arriving today at Zhuolu,
Chiyou’s days are long past.
The waters of Banquan flow through winter and summer—
how many springs and autumns have passed since then?
Thus, the victories of mighty armies,
even now remain unsettled.
A life of killing, breeding enmity—
when will this journey end?

**[For a Daoist Companion]**

My companion, steadfast in winter’s sacred land,
the northwest has a breach—
it would cost a thousand merits to repair,
but now is not the time; wait for spring’s warmth to complete it.
Circumstances have obscured the original cause.

I have the joy of forests and springs,
but you lack the heart to mend the breach.

A sacred realm lies secluded in this land,
where kindred spirits meet beyond the world.
When spring returns, all shall be made complete—
a gathering of the Perfected in full.
With merits fulfilled and the Way accomplished,
we shall ascend the clouded heavens hand in hand.

**At Longyang Abbey on the Ninth Day**

White wine eases the heart,
yellow blossoms burst with fragrance.
Such true delight marks the Double Ninth—
the moon of the mind finds its perfect round.
Beyond the mountains, three autumns pass without change,
while hidden railings frame clusters of full bloom.
Two pavilions, each adorned with fresh blossoms,
surpass even the celestial groves of the grotto-heavens.

**Exhortation to the World**

The Dao reveals the wondrous subtlety of clarity and void,
while Buddhism illumines the depths of wisdom.
Confucius’ benevolence and righteousness endure through ages—
the three sages share a single heart.
Yet those who fail to recognize silent enlightenment,
who only divide gates and households,
will one day close their eyes to see the path ahead,
and regret their failure to achieve completion.

**[Divining a Dwelling]**

Divining a dwelling west of the pass,
where ten thousand layered peaks rise,
and the river winds through them,
curving up and down for twenty or thirty li.
Muddy waves surge, mulberry and hemp gleam in the sun,
the people are kind, the land remote—
a fitting plan for one’s final years.
I style myself the Hermitage of Aging,
and send this short verse to mark it:

Ten thousand layered peaks stretch in emerald,
a thousand bends trace the winding path.
The villagers dwell content in soil and sericulture,
flowing waters carry fragrant fallen blossoms.
Here I settle to age in peace,
letting form wither and heart grow withered.
Unmoving, I spend my remaining years—
where else might one seek immortals?

**Inscribed at Tongxian Abbey**

Rows of verdant peaks stand graceful,
the immortal capital’s aura is pure.
The Three Yangs align in the jade turtle’s form,
a single qi shaped by heaven itself.
Amid ten thousand layered clouds and mountains,
lies a grotto-heaven’s secluded garden.
Who could dwell here long in leisure,
finding boundless joy in stillness?

**Urging the Making of a Quilted Robe**

Last night the west wind blew fierce,
this morning autumn’s chill runs deep.
Though the Daoist has subdued the heart,
cold and heat remain hard to endure.
The quilted robe should be made ample,
to drape by day and cover by night.
Even this single garment may not suffice—
where else might one seek refuge?

**At Longmen Creek, Sharing Moon-viewing with Elder Zhai**

The creek’s waters greet the frost with chill,
mountain blossoms bear dew’s freshness.
Good friends together admire the jade toad’s round,
a grand gathering with boundless delight.
I still recall the thousand li of West Lake,
where the pale orb shone clear and whole.
Tonight, three years have passed since then—
it all seems like a dream of wandering immortals.

**For the Lady of Dragon-Tiger**

The merit of the Northern Sea remains unfulfilled,
yet the journey to Red City is complete.
A body in pure stillness forever forgets sorrow—
where might idle cares arise?
At forty, one stands beyond doubt,
understanding all things with clarity.
Rejoicing in heaven’s decree, preserving peace and harmony,
the true principle was never much at all.

**Composed on Clear Water**

The true teaching unfolds in accord with the times,
revealing the precious altar as the moment demands.
The host of Perfected descend to leave traces among men,
yet still they await their place among the ranks of immortals.
Countless beings are transformed and delivered,
each one guided to awakening.
When merit is complete and the Way fulfilled,
they ascend Penglai, spared the three calamities of the kalpa.

**Self-Reflection**

The lands south of Yan are damp and hot,
while beyond the mountains lies a cool, clear sky.
Yin and yang are hard to fathom, topsy-turvy,
old karmic bonds entangle of their own accord.
For two years I’ve endured the journey’s scorching heat,
silent all day, without speech.
In leisure, my merit and practice remain incomplete—
this only steels my resolve.

**Warning Against Ignorance**

A single point of radiant light,
yet three thousand karmic obstacles run deep.
I urge you to search carefully while there’s time—
do not wait for disaster to strike.
Turn yourself wherever you go,
for wisdom’s nature can generate expedient means.
If you grasp these subtle truths,
you hold the ladder to heaven itself.

**Phoenix Perches on the Wutong: Eleven Poems**
*Composed at Autumn Sun Abbey*

The true teaching has spread for a thousand ages,
yet in this fleeting world, how many awaken in their hearts?
Suddenly roused, they seek the path out of samsara—
turning the head, they find the ferry of the true immortals.
With merit complete and the Way fulfilled, they depart for Penglai,
accompanied by Ever-Spring, carefree and without thought.
There are myriad wondrous blossoms beyond number—
who among those not freed from the dust can see them?

**Again**

Worldly affairs stretch endlessly—
when will they ever end?

How could one compare to those who forget worldly schemes,
learning from me to return early to the mountains?
Beneath the peaks, amidst the woods, I often laugh alone—
who among the unenlightened can ever reach this place?
All day in wordless silence, one moves quietly.

Dusk departs, dawn arrives,
yet never a moment of idle vexation.
Cherish the true yang treasure within the body,
no need for elixirs to keep the countenance fair.

**Again**

I know not how to inquire into Chan or meditation,
but wander idly through the world,
only keeping the mind unobscured.
Trampling the void to shatter the six pairs,
beneath the pines on the crags, I sleep fully clothed in one long slumber.

Why boast of quick wit before others?
A single spark of numinous clarity
permits no dust to veil it.
The nature of the Dharma shines resplendent—observe the self at ease,
returning to the root, restoring life, transcending the three realms.

**In Response to the Invitation from Xuande Prefecture**

Beyond the mountains, I have traversed all three yangs.
At Xuande, facing the primal origin—
we must meet before it is too late.
For years, worldly affairs at the master’s side have wearied me,
and I drift alone, blown by the wind.

How many times have I vowed beneath the boundless sky?
Coarse food and rough robes,
cutting off all human ties.
Wealth, honor, and glory hold no allure—
better to perfect cultivation beneath the cliffs.

**Again**

Spring’s light on the crags nears its twilight.

Alas, the spring’s radiance—
no means to detain its fleeting grace.
Spring departs, autumn arrives, the four seasons divide,
each coming and going forging cold and heat.
The reckoning of years deceives, yet none awaken.
Gain and loss, sorrow and joy—
all are but the turns of the wheel of rebirth.
I would leave words of caution and exhortation,
yet the human heart remains unenlightened, with no path to the Unborn.

**Composed at the Temple of Primordial Dao**

Where lies the finest vista beyond the mountains?
In Shanggu’s numinous traces—
since ancient times, the Temple of the Yellow Emperor.
Fountains of pure streams coil and meander,
while emerald cypresses stand in countless ranks.
Today, I arrive in leisurely cloud-and-water wandering.
With unbridled brush, I chant wildly,
laughing freely to open my heart.
Ten thousand scenes cannot assail a mind aligned with the Dao—
the wondrous body of the Perfected True is perfectly luminous and complete.

**Matching the Verse of the Green Void Altar**

Where to fathom the profound subtlety of the Supreme Dao?
Deluded thoughts and perverse reflections—
these are the demons and beasts of the mind.
To cultivate the three fields and nurture flourishing sprouts,
embrace true constancy, true stillness, true imperishability.
The five qi converge at the origin, the true One resounds.
A thousand words, ten thousand phrases—
one must await the dissolution of the six yin.
From ancient times to now, the deluded fail to perceive:
vainly do they transmute the wondrous into festering sores.

**Again**

Turn inward to investigate that single spark of numinous clarity.

**Dispelling the Myriad Demons**

Scatter all the host of demons, drive off the beasts of the western mountains.
Ten thousand trees of jade blossoms weave brocade—
ever-springing, forever claiming rootless imperishability.
Cloud-friends from the four seas come and go in harmony.
Above and below, the primal harmony surges,
gradually the six yang arise.
A single ray of numinous light pierces bone and permeates marrow,
the fragrance of purity transforms the very scent of the womb.

**Expressing My Feelings**

I have nearly traversed the realm entire,
ten years of toil—lest I betray my master’s vow.
Now old, I let go, leaving worldly affairs far behind,
roaming mountains and rivers, following fate’s turn.
I tell my kindred spirits: heed my counsel.
The kalpa’s blades and soldiers—each shall witness them firsthand.
Yet still they cling to craving, to love and attachment.
How can they escape the perils that lie ahead?

**Composed at the Temple of Flourishing Peace in the Era of Great Prosperity**

Ancient traces, a jade palace—worthy of my resolve.
Cypress and pine, verdant and deep,
bear the breath of everlasting spring.
Only when merit is complete shall deliverance be met,
in wordless stillness, one accords with Heaven’s intent.
Fortunate to find this tranquil, serene abode,
throughout the day I wander carefree,
my heart unburdened by entanglements.
Now aged, I withdraw of my own accord—
when will the world’s endless clamor cease?

**Remembering My Master**

My master often spoke of it:
Yanshan was the finest place under heaven.
Sure enough, it was there he was laid to rest.
I record his meaning in these humble verses.

Where in the world is scenery so fine?
Mountains and seas commune in secret,
none compare to the Dao of Yanzhong.
Cloud-friends from the four seas gather and circle,
my master, in silent awakening, knew to return here.
Once entered into the Mystery’s gate, one must awaken early.
Who understands the cultivation of truth?
This matter is not trifling.
Heaven’s intent is clear—it allowed a temple to rise,
Yanshan’s thousand-mile embrace.

**Ten Lyrics to the Tune "Linjiangxian"**
*On the Manifestation of the Primordial Origin*

Since parting from the capital, worldly affairs have dwindled,
not a speck of dust clings to my heart.
Idle songs, idle verses—silently I nurture the spirit.
All that is "with" is but delusion,
all that is "without" is the complete truth.
Embracing nature, a carefree wanderer of clouds and waters,
detached, indifferent, a man of leisure.
Following fate, at peace, free from close and distant ties.
The three yang near their fullness,
the five qi naturally converge at the origin.

**For Madame Yuan**

Madame Yuan dwelt in the desert for ten years,
then left the household, returning to the capital.
I compose these verses to honor her.

Ten years acquainted with the desert’s vastness,
now, in a single dawn, she returns to the capital’s gates.
Each thought stirs sorrow in her soul.
Put aside the tale of Su Wu,
say no more of Han’s Lady Zhaojun.
Past and future—all swept aside.
Fortunate to meet the true master, Ever-Spring.
Your devotion to the Dao grows daily anew.
August Heaven would never betray virtue,
nor would the Earth Spirit fail one so worthy.

**Seated in Stillness at Western Mountain**

**Seated in Stillness at Western Mountain (continued)**

Seated in stillness at Western Mountain brings profound benefit,
rarely does one encounter the affairs of the mundane.
All day, well-fed, I indulge my carefree indolence.
Nurturing a body of purity and quiet,
transforming into the true master within.

For thirty years, I sought in vain through chaos,
now, at last, I recognize the true countenance.
Wild passions extinguished, all dharmas empty.
Originally, there was nothing to be done—
how futile the thousand efforts expended.

**Again**

It was ever a solitary thing,
yet stained by attachments, hard to know.
Deluded clouds disperse, the wind of wisdom blows.
Why seek beyond the self?
Sitting upright is the western heaven.

A thousand words, ten thousand phrases—all in vain,
yet enlightenment comes, and even "one" becomes false.
Advance at the pole’s tip, let no doubt arise.
Let go of all, one by one,
and every kind of bond will fall away.

**Again**

Having penetrated the Quanzhen teaching of purity and stillness,
why labor over scriptures and sutras?
Seek the trace and reason here.
Do not cling to deluded views,
nor refuse to turn back.

How could the true nature ever be extinguished?
Beyond true emptiness, idly searching.
Within it, desireless, recognize true cultivation.
Following conditions, ever still and settled,
responding to things, naturally complete.

**Admonition to the Assembly**

Eyes meet a thousand differences—nothing to grasp,
the mind at leisure, one realm suffices.
The true and constant, undimmed, the valley spirit clear.
All demons vanish from this,
and the single point naturally achieves perfection.

Beyond the world, chanting in purity brings solitary joy,
in the human realm, what do honor and disgrace matter?
I urge you to swiftly awaken and inquire of the path ahead.
To seek the true and real,
do not discuss false cleverness.

**Reflections**

The Provincial Governor Li invited me to Shandong to bury the Three Masters.
The Daoist communities and common folk of Yanjing all refused.
A decade has passed since we parted in Weiyang,
traversing the western frontier to the ends of the earth.
Returning, I dwell in the immortal palace of Yan.
Establishing teachings to clarify the ancestral doctrine,
expounding the Dharma to follow the masters’ footsteps.

Heaven’s will is not easily fathomed,
human sentiments, once exhausted, are hard to plumb.
My heart has always loved simplicity and leisure.
Yet I am made to dwell north of the sea,
not permitted to cross into Shandong.

By chance, I found:
Those who discourse on the wondrous and the profound are easily awakened,
but true purity and true stillness are hard to uphold.
Worldly affairs are unworthy of pursuit.
Among the ten directions, those with clear eyes—
who study me lack discipline.

Having awakened, one must return to simplicity,
throughout the day, let plainness and sincerity abide.
Concealing light, silent, outwardly like a fool.
The mind bright as the radiant moon,
the nature still, aligned with the perfect measure.

What has form and center is easily found,
but formless and placeless are hard to attain.
All day, the shadow alone keeps me company.
Fools seek but do not see,
the enlightened already know.

Diligently investigate this principle to grasp the truth,
a single great path without delusion.
I urge you to swiftly awaken—do not hesitate.
Constantly forgetting sight and sound,
step by step, enter the realm of mystery.

**[Gift to the Daoist Assembly]**
During my summer retreat on Wuhua Mountain,
a Daoist assembly came to see me, and I offered these words:

For years, I wandered the world through hardship,
now, by good fortune, I meet forest and spring.
Hungry, I eat; tired, I sleep.
A few leagues from the city,
lies another small paradise.

Seated above, the mountains and waters all flourish,
in the pond, blue lotuses bloom in full.
In old age, merit and conduct are hard to complete.
Unable to reach the Three Isles,
I first become an immortal of Wuhua.

**[Eight Poems Free of Worldly Thoughts]**

**To the Daoist Assembly of Longyang Abbey Requesting the Dharma of the Unified Mind**

Beyond the three vehicles’ wondrous essence,
the fruit severs birth and extinction.
All things know emptiness—nothing to grasp,
wisdom-nature shines bright, utterly clear.
Within stillness, heaven and earth;
in leisure, sun and moon—
worthy of sharing with a true friend.
Returning to my mountain home,
endless wind and moon await.

A speck of formless true suchness,
limpid and profound,
inner and outer indistinguishable.
To fathom the mystery’s core,
cast off wayward thoughts and folly.
Diligently discuss the subtle,
frequently cultivate the secret,
penetrate the celestial mechanism’s key.
If not now, when will you rest?

Again:
The myriad beings, all from primordial qi,
born of the boundless.
The clamorous multitudes cling to self,
while silent true emptiness eludes them.
Seeking nothing within being,
finding being within nothing—
who discerns this truth?
Only the perfected ones, in their expedience,
sing of the mystery’s essence.

This hidden gate of tradition
requires wisdom,
purity to open the heart’s chamber.
Having seen the original true face,
why covet fleeting splendor?
Dwelling in the human realm,
name inscribed in the immortal register,
not a speck of dust allowed to delude.
The spirit unshaken,
from of old, heaven and earth cannot fathom.

Again:
Winter’s cold, summer’s heat,
spring’s blossoms, autumn’s moon—
year after year, unchanged.
Only the body alters from dawn to dusk,
unaware of life’s hastening end.
Through ten thousand kalpas of confusion,
a single moment of awakening—
best to still the heart and rest.
Not a speck of dust clings,
the original luminous clarity.

Leisurely facing tortoise, crane, and pine peaks,
forest springs and secluded gardens,
freely opening the heart to joy.
When merit is complete and work perfected,
ascending the assembly,
only then does a man’s heroism shine.
This principle is not profound,
the mystery’s mechanism not distant—
yet without awakening, how can it be explained?
Who in the world understands?
In darkness, years pass in vain.

Again:
To the ends of the earth,
roaming freely wherever,
a body at ease.
Knowing worldly affairs as empty as wind past the ear,
yet finding some joy in fellowship.
Jade tripod simmering,
golden furnace boiling,
refining cinnabar elixir.
Consumed, one departs,
the transformed body soaring beyond the void.

Thus the immortal Dao’s subtlety:
shedding the dust of the mortal realm,
one joins the covenant.
Understanding the principle, penetrating reality,
virtue perfected—
why dwell in secluded cliffs and gorges?
The four marks dissolve,
the three corpses flee,
only because human sentiments are shallow.
The teaching of the Perfect Realization,
the great and upright heart—no error.

**Following Another’s Rhyme**

Mingling with the world,
grasping the profound mystery’s intent,
delving into Zhuang and Lie.
Gathering cloud companions to uphold the true teaching,
following the former masters without distinction.
Outwardly serene and kind,
inwardly steadfast—
truly like the foolish and dull.
Gate pure, household quiet,
naturally revealing loftiness.

The boundless realm of Perpetual Spring,
eternally cool and refreshing,
everywhere fit for rest.
Beyond the world, in the purest realm of the pot,
playing amidst white clouds and golden palaces.
Body lodged in the dusty world,
nature reaching beyond the heavens—
nothing can entangle.
The six senses unmoved,
this is non-arising, non-ceasing.

**Mid-Autumn Moon Viewing at Qiyun Abbey, Da’an Mountain**

Da’an’s lofty heights,
wind and dew pure, air crisp—
mid-autumn season.
Cloud friends and rosy companions gather,
together admiring the mountain’s bright moon.
Illuminating a thousand peaks,
brightening ten thousand ravines,
sitting in joyful heart.
Spirit clear, bones cold,
forever transcending the world’s rise and fall.

Gazing upon this night’s splendor,
words and brush labor in vain—
how to describe such wondrous scenes?
Shining upon a thousand gates, all may delight,
yet none compare to Qiyun’s purity.
Before the small courtyard, by the cliff,
beside the Great Cold Ridge,
seeming to touch the heavens.
Sitting in silent contemplation,
this place is fit for dwelling.

**Composed at Tongxian Abbey**

Tongxian’s secluded ground,
deep in the western mountains,
leaning against the cloud-touched traces.
Overlooking peaks upon peaks,
cutting off the red dust’s news.
Strolling amidst misty vines,
quietly chanting to wind and moon—
who recognizes such matters?
Cultivators of truth,
where else could one seek them?

An unbroken stretch of mountains and rivers,
cave heavens and secluded gardens—
a realm of immortals.
Who, entangled in fame and profit, can reach it?
Hard to accompany the pure and idle wanderers.
Sleeping high in jade grottoes,
sitting steady on clear cliffs—
why envy the mansions of kings and lords?
I have come several times,
lingering here many days.

**On Nature**

Spanning past and present,
this luminous, aware nature—
never lacking.
Who recognizes its perfect wholeness?
Chasing appearances, lost in confusion.
Ten thousand actions,
a thousand creations—
all resolved within the heart.
A touch of mystery—
when will you understand?

Not entering the formless mystery’s gate,
floating names hard to relinquish,
greedily gazing at idle flowers and grasses.
Mouths speak of purity, hearts unenlightened,
unaware of the wheel’s return.
Grasping the true mechanism,
startled from the dream of illusion,
freely roaming the three isles.
With a share in long life,
forever transcending the world’s decay.

**Conclusion of the *Baoguang Collection*, Volume Two**

**Ci Lyrics by the Perfected of Pure Harmony, Yin Zhiping**
*Fourteen "Jiangchengzi" Poems, Matching the Rhymes of Scholar Guo of Cangai*

**1.**
Riding chariots, mounted on horses—east and west we roam.
Discussing the mystery’s compass, entering subtleties deep.
The world’s peaks and valleys,
each by lot finds its stair.
Our teaching spreads, heaven and earth protect it—
none fail to rejoice, all take refuge.

**2.**
Who awaits the message within?
Mastering non-action, knowing the uncontrived.
Cloud friends and mist companions,
the heart’s ground must be level and smooth.
Embracing simplicity, preserving the true—daily use shines:
the spirit radiant, the nature luminous.

**Composed at Longyang Abbey on the Winter Solstice**
Six yin phases spent, one yang arises.
Hidden sprouts, light snowflakes fall.
Nine nines of bitter cold,
rivers and seas freeze in layered ice.
The two qi circulate without abiding—
yang’s count fulfilled, the dragon ascends.

Returning to the root, restoring the mandate, the numinous nature brightens.
Passing the heavenly court, entering the formless.
The celestial mechanism’s return,
the moon’s glow ascends and descends.
Seizing heaven and earth’s true transformation,
merit complete, one journeys to Penglai.

**3.**
The Daoist’s livelihood—daily the face opens in joy.
The nature broad, the six spirits at peace.
Concealing traces, veiling light,
no affairs reach the heart.
Nurturing that primal, numinous substance,
seekers of fame and profit cannot compare to leisure.

**4.**
How much joy can a life hold?
Age wears one down, the gate of life and death looms.
The six paths of rebirth,
coming and going in bitter hardship.
Best to recognize our gate’s intimate Way—
severing passions, rising beyond the dusty world.

**5.**
Dharma-light illumines widely, the Dao’s gate flourishes.
Emerging from heaven’s length, entering Longyang.
The precious hall complete,
morning and evening incense burns in the heart.
Cloud friends and mist companions—seek not without,
the heart’s ground steadfast is heaven.

**6.**
South of Yan and north of the River—how sorrowful!
In this desolate wild, enduring frost and wind.
The kalpa’s turning,
when will one reach the immortal land?
Who understands the intent of dwelling in seclusion beyond the mountains?
*[Text missing]*... the small Peng Isle.

**On the Twelfth-Month Snow**
Jade blossoms swirl, pearl dust flies.
Filling the long embankment,
piling at the wicker gate.
Warmth by the window, brightness within—
what need for embroidered curtains?
Night still, clouds withdrawn, the silver mirror full,
watching the snow and moon vie in splendor.

**7.**
The season’s end—a true marvel, rare through ages.
Aiding winter’s might, revealing the year’s abundance.
Moving poets’ souls,
their spirits enter the subtle and profound.
The talented Lady Xie could not exhaust its praise—
leaving it for us, Daoists, to know.

**On the Clear Weather During the Ritual**
At Xishan’s Tongxian Abbey, the ritual for Chongyang was set.
Days before, the north wind howled fiercely, the sky dim,
light snow falling—all grew anxious.
After the eighth day’s proclamation, suddenly the skies cleared,
two days and nights completed.
On the tenth, snow returned—
a thousand mouths as one praised the rare and wondrous omen.
Thus a lyric was composed to record the truth.

**8.**
Chongyang’s fine festival, the ritual at Western Mountain.
Dusk’s chill, leaves mottled.
Harmonious qi fills the riverlands,
none fail to smile.
Stagnant souls and lonely spirits all receive deliverance,
merit complete, emerging from the dark gate.

**9.**
River clear, valley still—qi at ease.
The heart’s inch wide, preserved whole and calm.
White wine, yellow blossoms,
a grand assembly at the immortals’ altar.
Together we celebrate our gate’s ancestral master’s protection—
the host of perfected rejoice, ten thousand people cheer.

**10.**
In the Gengyin year, returning from Tongxian’s ritual, the wish unfulfilled.
Parting from Daoist friends and all ritual patrons with a lyric.

Since parting at Jade River, leaving Western Mountain,
dawn’s frost cold, passing the layered gates.
Letters summon, one must attend the pure altar.
Though delivering the dead and transcending life is good,
the years are late, temples streaked with silver.

**11.**
Cultivating the true not yet complete, accumulating merit hard.
Refining the heart broad, awakening to the true at ease.
The work of transformation,
all in a moment’s time.
Turning the mysterious mechanism, perfecting utmost virtue—
no desires remain, one joins the immortals’ ranks.

**Parting from Daoist Friends at Xianshan’s Precelestial Abbey**
Precelestial’s parting—thoughts sink in silence.
Seeking pure shade, dispersing the hidden heart.

**Enduring Summer’s Heat**

No scorching heat remains, nor do mosquitoes invade.
In pure stillness, dwelling brings lasting peace—
each day here worth a thousand gold.
Here, Daoist friends hold firm resolve,
daily seeking, chanting pure tones.
Inquiring the Way, exalting truth,
linking past and present with clarity.
Through nine summers, what can I offer in return?
As I depart, I leave these rough verses.

**Midwinter**
*Tracking Dragon’s Auspicious Traces at the Ancient Immortal Altar*

Mountains embrace waters, winding paths curve.
Jade halls and vermilion gates
tower amid white clouds.
Could this be Penglai’s palace by the misty shore?
A land of true blessing—
where joy may unfold.

**Midwinter Travels**
No bitter cold in winter’s journey.
Daoists gather, hearts rejoice in words.
Having seen the Three Peaks,
after parting, both grow idle.
When shall we laugh again beneath the pines?
Scattering is easy,
but reunion proves hard.

**Winter in the Square Retreat**

Together in winter’s square retreat,
we praise the secluded dwelling,
discussing the primordial beginning.
Conversing past midnight,
all seems to touch the clear and void.
A thousand affairs sought with intent—yet unattained.
Rely on *Xiangwang*,
and grasp the mysterious pearl.

One word settles all—
nature abides in suchness.
Delighting in non-action,
riding the cloud chariot,
we pay homage to the lofty perfected,
our merit complete, ascending to the immortals’ capital.
Swift awakening—all share this portion.
Hear my counsel:
do not cling to folly.

**Composed in Yizhou**

The world’s tangled dreams offer no rest,
even briefly.

**The Ant’s Endless Cycle**

The ant’s endless cycle—
rarely does one smile.
To awaken to the Dao, refine the true,
one must break free from death and life’s gate.
Recognize the primordial beginning as empty of all things—
cast aside delusion,
sever all high aspirations.

**Old Age’s Leisure**

In old age, ease and joy suit idleness best.
Lay down the fishing rod,
return the boat to shore.
Wander beyond the world’s dust,
traverse the ancient immortals’ altars.
Wait yet for the Eastern Lord’s message—
cross the Liao River,
gaze upon Mount Lü.

**Another Reflection**

Cultivation reveals deep karmic roots.
Finding a kindred spirit,
the heart at once grows clear.
Through the twelve hours,
external realms cannot intrude.
To preserve life and perfect the true requires no other art—
so easily done,
yet not hard to seek.

**A Timeless Insight**

All at once, the ancient and present are seen through.
Trust in idle chanting,
delight in distant peaks.
From sea’s edge to heaven’s end,
every place is a fine sanctuary.
Carry on the lineage, uphold the teaching—
enjoy heaven’s rank,
earn the world’s reverence.

**Composed at Zhenchang Abbey, Yuci County**

The true and constant responds to things with square and round.
Follow conditions as they come,
fulfill the work in full.
Eyes upright, heart bright—
recognize the power of transformation.
In daily use, be selfless, nurture with integrity;
vast *qi* fills all,
revealing the embryo immortal.

**A Moment of Boundless Joy**

In this hour of celebration, boundless joy arises.
Pierce the profound mystery,
eternal and unbroken.
Illumine the human realm—
how can illusory realms endure?
Then make lasting plans for the old homeland—
observe the Eight Waters,
wander the Three Rivers.

**Moonviewing at Shenxiao Palace, Qinzhou**

Pure light gleams bright in the evening sky.
Perfectly clear,
it suits the secluded mood.
Delight in the moment,
a lofty gathering of cloud-borne friends.
Tonight’s clarity shines down in boundless radiance—
without this evening,
where would peace be found?

The azure sky like water, the moon full and bright.
The pearl of nature stills—
preserve it for long life.
The four seas flow clear,
where is there no fulfillment?
Grateful for the exalted one’s profound virtue,
overseeing all lands,
the teaching flourishes.

**Five *Wumeng Ling* Poems**
*Composed at Longyang Abbey during the Spring Equinox*

Fellow Daoists refine sleep through three winters,
forging the lineage of Chen Tuan.
A new spring passes in an instant—
day and night must be met with blessings.
Blessings, blessings—
let every drop fall to earth.

**Five More *Wumeng Ling* Poems**
*Composed at Longyang Abbey during Spring*

In spring’s sleep at Longyang, I awoke to the true meaning of spring’s light.
The sun already three poles high—
yet startled awake by the spring wind.
Startled awake, startled awake—
all things are but a spring dream.

---

Quietly burning heart-incense in secret,
the three realms and ten directions become clear.
Across the four seas to the ends of the earth,
all are branches and leaves of the Perfect Realization.
Branches and leaves, branches and leaves—
piercing through the bright moon of the clear night.

---

I keep to my secluded window, guarding simplicity,
seeing through spring blossoms and autumn moons.
When the meaning is grasped, I return—
best to rest body and mind.
Rest, rest—
forging a furnace of spring snow.

---

To speak of this toilsome life as a dream,
each one deluded in empty slumber.
Silently awakening the mind’s opening,
attaining true communion in a pure dream.
Pure dream, pure dream—
who would believe the perfected are dreamless?

---

**Two Poems for the Unemotional Scholar**
*Composed at Longyang Abbey when Qiuyang of Dongchuan came to visit. After the Lantern Festival of the bingxu year, written as parting verses before departure.*

Each night at the third watch, we questioned one another,
breaking through the falsity of human sentiments.
Each one awakened to the true source—
the heart of Dao flows free.
I hope Qiuyang will turn his intent back,
not indulging in spring’s high sleep.
Soon he will return—
his smile will bloom.

---

Unshunning the distant spring wind,
coming and going, silently conveying true intent.
Which one is my home?
Trusting the ends of the earth.
The original nature, mysterious and unobstructed, without attachment,
brings peace to this body wherever it goes.
All is clear—no east or west—
dwelling on Cloud Peak.

---

**Following Dongchuan’s Daoist Companions**
A guest from Western Mountain awaits.
What is this true intent?
Lo, lo.
Seventy has always been rare—
now I reach sixty.
The floating world is not steadfast—
drunk and carefree.

---

**Reply to Daoist Friends of Xuande Prefecture at Qiuyang Abbey**

Deep thanks for your invitation,
arriving just as spring’s command begins at West Cliff.
A hundred birds clamor in joy—
no delight left unexpressed.
The Daoist assembly fills the valley with harmonious qi,
after the rites, we await heaven’s will.
Karmic affinity merges with emptiness—
east or west, as it may be.

---

Only wishing for a peaceful body and tranquil mind,
who would envy the comings and goings of invitations?
The true teaching fills the ends of the earth,
crossing the Flowing Sands.
The master’s intent is truly compassionate and universal,
meant to awaken all beings.
Cultivate boundless deeds—
the nature will then be round.

---

**Parting from Daoist Friends of West Mountain**

I have wandered to the corners of the earth,
yet none compare to the joy of West Mountain’s heart.
When the mood is spent, I return east—
my temples streaked with silver.
We have both passed the age of sixty,
what assurance is there after parting?
Only wishing each heart may rest—
forever without sorrow.

---

Three elders share the blessing of purity,
spending days roaming the mountains, never enough.
Sitting and lying amidst white clouds,
gazing at green peaks.
After the meal, on the eastern slope’s rocks,
laughter and talk open the heart’s vastness.
Such wondrous scenes banish sorrow—
facing the clear stream.

**Parting from Daoist Assembly of Weizhou**

In the tenth month, journeying through Weiluo to teach,
sending off and welcoming carriages and horses.
Harmonious qi fills the mountains and rivers—
the wind of the teaching spreads.

When will we meet again after parting?
Only wishing each heart may awaken.
Accumulate merit to three thousand—
transforming demons into spirits.

---

The ninety-ninth day, severe cold with ice congealed,
behind the mountains, the north wind howls bitterly.
Heading west—what is your intent?
Lo, lo.
Daoist friends, a single word of farewell—
take care not to stir the heart.
Keep your will steady and harmonious—
the Dao is without demons.

---

Wherever there are Daoists and companions,
do not let human sentiments grow thick.
In all things, remain ordinary—
fewer calamities will come.
After parting, you should head west,
patiently receiving and attending to all who come.
One day, we must meet again—
looking toward Zhongnan.

---

**Composed at Huairen County**

I love Huairen in winter’s moon,
warm kang, bright window—fit for rest.
Heaven’s will allows no idleness—
crossing South Mountain.
East or west, not by my wish,
I have nearly traversed the corners of the earth.
The fruit of Dao is still unripened—
I set forth once more.

---

**Retiring in Old Age to Qin Prefecture, Then Returning to the Great Longchun Abbey in Yanjing at the Imperial Summons**

In the tenth month, the lesser spring’s command,
all things return to their roots, settling in stillness.
Only I wander between water and clouds—
crossing East Mountain.
Pointing straight to ancient Yanjing, without fixed abode,
though old, how dare I defy heaven’s decree?
Turning my head to gaze at Zhongnan—
I will come to visit again.

---

**Matching Rhymes to Part from Prefect Du of Qinzhou**

Unenlightened, it is hard to align with heaven’s command,
who understands stillness born from movement?
The Dao lies between being and non-being—
separated by a thousand mountains.
Departure and stay, free from doubt, the heart settled,
following fate with carefree ease.
All day, not lost to the south—
what more is there to seek?

---

**Seventeen *Jianzi Mulan Hua* Poems**
*Composed at Qiuyang Abbey to Exhort the World*

Piling gold, amassing jade,
day after day, greed and stinginess never satisfied.
What more is sought when enough is had?
Only awaiting the barren grave on the wild moor.
There is a path to turn back—
why do fools remain deluded, unenlightened?
If they awaken and turn back,
they will spare themselves endless sorrow ahead.

---

This toilsome life wastes lives—
who understands that clothing and food are all predestined?
Indulging in desire, greed, and ignorance,
accumulating karma like mountains, yet unaware.
One day, when retribution comes,
even those with iron gall and bronze hearts will regret.
Suffering without end—
how they will hate not having heard of early cultivation!

---

Stubborn folly unceasing,
fortune and misfortune still follow the body like a shadow.
Calamities and heavenly disasters—
all arise from the hearts of men.
If this principle is understood,
all things should be seen as oneself.
Once the celestial truth is perceived,
good and evil at that moment rest entirely with man.

---

Harming others for self-gain,
greed, deceit, and cheating—when will it end?
Harming the many to build a household,
still boasting of wealth and honor before others.
Dark records of yin deeds—
who will take your place when death comes?
The Dao of heaven is impartial—
retribution is clear, each in its time.

---

Is heaven far?
The deluded world seeks it in vain.
Is hell not near?
Countless beings crowd its gates.
Wise and discerning noble ones—
fortunate to be human, diligently set your will.
Will set in a peaceful heart,
even a single good deed, unspoiled, and the Dao is naturally fulfilled.

---

**Three Yang Daoists**
*In Jinshan, there are three abbeys, each with "Yang" in their name. Hence, those who come and go here are called the Three Yang Daoists.*

Three Yang Daoists,
sitting opposite cloud peaks, discussing the non-dual.
All dharmas as they are—
all contained in the cold laughter of forgetting the mechanism.

The true nature of ignorance—
this principle is hard to expound, how to realize it?
To realize the primordial origin,
recognize the lone autumn moon in the vast sky.

*Autumn Yang Daoist Friend Visited*
Golden waves and jade nectar—
apart from Guī River, nowhere to seek.
Jade nectar and golden waves,
a single draught harmonizes the five qi.
The great elixir of returning cinnabar,
consumed, brings everlasting joy.
The great elixir of returning cinnabar—
the fortune-thin multitude finds it hard to behold.

*A Daoist Presents Du Fu’s "Spring Excursion" Poetry Scroll*
Excursions in spring, drinking to delight—
all things flourish, flowers like brocade.
Drinking to delight in spring excursions—
how many have ever been led astray?
Confucian scholars and Daoist priests—
how many grasp the will beyond heaven?
Daoist priests and Confucian scholars—
who would renounce worldly passions and rest at once?

*Addressing the Assembly*
Deep in years of Dao cultivation,
though not yet spiritually attuned, the qi and spirit are fine.
Deep in years of Dao cultivation,
amid a thousand scenes, nothing invades.
Fellow practitioners, heed this advice:
fleeting profit and hollow fame—keep them far.
Heed this advice, fellow practitioners—
lay down all entanglements and swiftly cultivate.

*Again*
When body and mind are torn asunder,
this is the true visage of the primordial origin.
Torn asunder, body and mind—
a will like a mountain, transcending past and present.
If you awaken to this trifling truth,
you escape the ceaseless coming and going.
If you awaken to this trifling truth—
in ten thousand kalpas, such an encounter is rare.

*Again*
Dwelling in the world, mingling with the dust—
who understands wordless intoxication?
Mingling with the world, dwelling in the dust—
content in poverty, carefree and untrammeled.
The numinous source never dimmed—
surpassing boundless treasures, the true jewel is possessed.
Never dimmed, the numinous source—
a single qi refined, one ascends to heaven.

*Presented to Lady Dragon-Tiger*
Dim and silent—
who can fathom worldly wisdom and cleverness?
Silent and dim—
desireless, one opens the gates to all wonders.
Embracing simplicity, preserving authenticity—
no worries, no thoughts, no contrivance.
Preserving authenticity, embracing simplicity—
entering sagehood, transcending the mundane lies within each person.

*Composed at Western Mountain*
Cultivating the true near the vulgar—
the initial stage is hard, the heart’s terrain must ripen.
Near the vulgar, cultivating the true—
who remains unstained amid the dust?
Amid forests and springs, indulging in delight—
this is cultivating the true, nothing to verify.
Indulging in delight amid forests and springs—
for now, be a carefree immortal on earth.

*Again*
Settling in meditation amidst the village—
hard to escape the trivial grasping of leisure.
Amidst the village, settling in meditation—
Buddhas and patriarchs ever fear falling into entanglement.
Reclining freely in the mountains—
no worries, no thoughts, true bliss.
Freely reclining in the mountains—
a single spark of numinous light, nothing invades.

*Presented to the Myriad Lotuses Assembly of Yanjing*
Turning the head, reflecting inward—
worldly affairs are endless, worthy of a wry smile.
Reflecting inward, turning the head—
content, return—this is the time to rest.
Rest, rest—awaken!
Do not let greed and delusion gallop like wild horses.
Awaken, rest, rest—
let the years pass, spring after autumn.

*Huairen County*
Embracing benevolence, upholding righteousness—
the Five Emperors and Three Sovereigns governed thus.
Upholding righteousness, embracing benevolence—
all living beings under heaven are of one family.
Diligently studying virtue and the Dao—
establishing the state and founding the family as a model.
Studying virtue and the Dao diligently—
further, let it guide the cultivation of the self.

*Inviting Painter Zhang of the Western Route to Paint "Journey to the West" at Chushun Hall*
Painter of the Clear River—
in Chushun, the heart’s resolve is worthy of inspiration.
Painter of the Clear River—
when you arrive early, what is your intent?
Ancestors of the Quanzhen lineage—
painted upon white clouds, transmitted through the ages.
Lineage ancestors of Quanzhen—
eternally guarding Yanshan, renewed day by day.

*Awakening from the Southern Branch (Four Poems)*
*Admonishing the World*

Seeking immortality through false pretenses,
Deluded in truth, chasing the Buddha-mind.
Burning incense, bowing in vain pursuit—
Unsevered ignorance roots deeper karma.

Bitter words are like good medicine,
Loyal advice shines like fine gold.
When one meets the virtuous, become their confidant—
Rely on the Orthodox Teaching,
and ten thousand calamities cannot invade.

Again:
At birth, ignorance weighs heavy;
At death, hell yawns deep.
Every moment is more precious than gold—
Swiftly awaken to non-arising,
and the wise shall be your kin.

In a blink, one strays to other realms;
Turning back, recognize the original mind.
When merit is complete, one naturally transcends yin and yang—
Beyond the world, truly at ease,
composing verses in untrammeled clarity.

Again:
Do not deceive others gravely,
lest karmic retribution run deep.
The host of perfected ones descends to spread pure hymns,
Admonishing the deluded and ignorant,
warding off encroaching disasters.

Further awaken to the ever-true nature,
exhorting the cultivation of an auspicious, virtuous mind.
On the path of longevity, heed the immortals’ song—
The Orthodox Way admits no doubt,
steadily ascending the jadelike peaks.

Again:
Seek not the faults of others,
but reflect on your own strengths.
In conduct, be yielding; in nature, harmonious and radiant.
With no selfishness toward things,
the heart-ground attains cool clarity.

Extinguish the fire of ignorance,
and the incense of wisdom naturally arises.
Why labor to seek heaven afar?
In effortless ease,
everywhere is the land of immortals.

**Four Lyrics to "Green Jade Table" – Self-Bequeathed**

**I**
With lifted brows and flashing eyes, the truth stands plainly shown,
I recognize the source from which I’ve ever sprung.
The incense of stillness and non-action fills the censer whole.
Ten directions unobstructed, the Three Realms all resound—
Let the years draw to their close, I care not where they run.

A touch of wonder draws the gaze beyond the pass,
Where the true ones dwell, forgetting all coming and going.
Three or four companions, clouds and mist their guise,
Singing wild verses in carefree delight,
Content in poverty, rejoicing in the Dao—
Beyond this, nothing else is sought.

**II**
Banish evil from the heart and ever cultivate good,
Naturally attaining the true and wondrous means.
The supreme Dao is level and plain, easy to behold.
Before your eyes, all is upright—
Let right and wrong be set aside,
A fitting companion for long life’s road.

Profound words, once grasped, need no debate,
Silently nurturing the true within, inner light appears.
The elixir of spirit, refined ninefold, now complete,
Transforms the body beyond the void,
Six ounces of celestial grace bestowed—
This face is no longer as it was before.

**III**
Let not the heart cling to fleeting splendor; return to the Dao,
Gradually penetrating the mysteries of the profound.
With the work of stillness perfected, the mind-ground is clear.
Ascend the far shore, forever claiming cool serenity,
No idle cares or vexations remain.

The true realm of everlasting spring knows no aging immortals,
Yet who can reach this cave-heaven, though it lies close at hand?
All dusty passions of the heart are swept away,
Within jade palaces and immortal courts,
Riding the wind in pure delight,
Feasting and roaming Penglai Isle.

**IV**
When the host of demons scatters, what confusion can remain?
All things are free from entanglement.
A single gleam attends the Green Jade Table,
Not a speck of dust clings,
No obstructions endure—
The face of emptiness is seen.

I urge you: swiftly cast off worldly passions,
Begin your practice now, lest the hour grow late.
Ahead lie wind and waves, deep and treacherous,
Yet the divine vessel sails steady,
Cloud-borne companions at your side,
Laughing as they point toward the reed-flower shore.

---

**Seven Lyrics to "Auspicious Partridge" – For Junior Master Jia of Yanzhen Abbey**

The Daoist’s thoughts arise in no common way,
Yet old karma’s bonds entangle, bringing misfortune near.
Only through plain and earnest cultivation can the true endure,
While vain and hollow learning of the Dao cannot long prevail.

Thoughts arise and fade, the heart finds no repose,
But unmoving, unshaken, the mind is easily guarded.
Awaken early to the eternal, and merit will amass—
Then, when the time comes, your resolve will stand firm and strong.

---

**Ode to Western Mountain**

Deep in Western Mountain dwells the Daoist’s home,
Where nurturing the Dao and refining the true finds no equal place.
Through the nine summer months, high sleep banishes the heat,
In autumn’s third season, new melons bear their fruit.

Below the rugged slopes, millet and grain thrive,
By the muddy river’s edge, wheat and hemp grow tall.
Through all four seasons, harmony reigns, worldly affairs are few—
From dawn to dusk, the Three Primes are the whole of life.

---

**Passing Dragon Spring Valley**

A fine stretch of folk along Western Mountain’s range,
Winding waters encircle the peaks like a grotto-heaven.
No right, no wrong, no favor, no disgrace—
Only flowers, fruits, and forest springs.

Every household reveres the Dao, welcoming idle guests,
Each door honors the altar, paying homage to the great immortals.
With such diligence in virtuous deeds,
Peace and joy abound in years of plenty.

---

**Admonition to the Assembly**

Debating Dao and Chan, vying in clever turns,
Eyes half-closed in drowsy haze, lost in confusion’s maze.
Still chasing fame and profit, the heart remains ensnared—
How can one know the harm to self or aid to others?

Worthy friends keep their distance, sages stay far away,
While false companions draw near, like wolves and tigers at your side.
When the reckoning comes and regret is vain,
Awaken early, gather your heart—do not indulge in deceit.

---

**Again**

Fortunate to encounter the flourishing of the teaching,
Yet why cling to worldly glory, letting time slip by?
Reduce food, lessen sleep—spirit grows bright and clear,
Forget passions, cast off desires—qi becomes pure and refined.

For a time, vigilance wards off suffering and woe,
But long practice transcends life and death.
I urge the wise to reflect and awaken—
While body and strength endure, begin your cultivation.

---

**Exhortation to the World**

The teachings of Everlasting Spring are entrusted to purity and harmony,
Exhorting the wise to emerge from the river of desire.
Cultivate virtue and Dao—heaven grants joy,
While clinging to worldly passions breeds demonic ills.

Set down the present and wander the true realm,
For deep merit in life leads to the Great Luo after death.
I speak these loyal words plainly—
Consider them well, and what will your heart decide?

---

**Again**

Six years of effort yield modest achievement,
Roots deepen, stems strengthen, growth unfolds in time.
East court and west palace host idle guests,
Daoists journey south and north along the way.

Harmonious qi from all directions invigorates the spirit,
The Dao-eye shines clear across the four seas.
The celestial wind of mysterious workings arrives here—
On Yan Mountain’s road, a bright path lies ahead.

---

**Two Lyrics to "Southern Village"**

**I. Casually Composed at Baoxuan Hall**

By nature fond of ease and indolence,
Unburdened by fame, untroubled by poverty.
Carefree, following conditions without hindrance,
The heart is open—
Seeing through all worldly affairs as empty.

Gain and loss are fundamentally the same,
Why trouble over movement or stillness, fortune or misfortune?
Stolidly advancing, true contentment is found—
Success lies
In wordless, cold amusement.

---

**II. For the Daoist of the Western Route**

Fortunate to meet with good causes,
Yet vainly entangled in fleeting fame, enduring hardship and toil.
All for some trifling matter before your eyes—
Procrastinating,
You’ve passed the midpoint, and the body is changed.

Sit in silence, guarding the numinous root,
Beyond the void, idly seeking the void’s truth.
Recognizing the wondrous, subtle thing from the primal beginning,
It may be embraced—
Call it immortal, not human.

---

**Lyric to "Yu the Beauty" – Exhortation to the World**

Of late, my spirit seems to surge,
Seeing through the dream of human life.
All because of tranquil contentment, delighting in purity and harmony.
With no selfishness toward things,
Light shines across the mountains and rivers.

Now I urge all who cultivate the true:
Do not wait until it is too late.
One day, departing, you’ll regret your humble state—
Lamenting that you did not,
In those days, toil diligently in practice.

---

**Lyric to "Moon over the Sea, Crabapple Blossoms" – Admonition to the Assembly**

**Five Poems on Treading the Clouds – Presented to the Daoist Assembly of Changchun Palace**

The late Master’s departure left boundless merit,
Daily presiding over a thousand altars, manifesting sacred forms.
With a hundred, a thousand transformations,
In secret, guiding souls to and fro.
Beware of slander—
Lest misfortune descend, how will you face it?
In an instant, enlightenment spreads to the utmost,
Gathering disciples far and wide, offering universal reverence.
Only uphold fasting and precepts,
With wholehearted devotion, each cherishing reverence.
In the vast emptiness,
Surely the divine will bestow rewards.

---

**Wise sons of intelligence,**
**Bright and discerning superior men.**
Fortunate to meet the Master’s guidance in cultivating the true,
Preserving light in halls facing green mountains,
White clouds fit companions for the Ever-Spring Master.
Delighting in the Dao, illuminating the mind,
Surpasses poring over classics and histories.
Names inscribed in the register of immortals—
Let all diligently guard the numinous trace,
Will Heaven fail those of lofty and pure resolve?

---

**Self-Reflection**

Paltry profit, hollow fame—
Who can renounce them?
Ahead, the path is perilous, yet still they cling in greed.
Only I dare not indulge in vanity,
For my heart holds a vow to transcend the Three Realms.
Widely spreading a breeze of compassion,
Never slackening in effort.
With a mind embracing forbearance, ever patient,
Opening the heart’s ground like empty space,
Clearly perceiving that which is truly indestructible.

---

**Again**

Hidden high immortals,
Openly bestow protection.
White clouds’ immortal traces shall be fulfilled.
Our lineage’s Seven Ancestors guard Mount Yan,
A myriad golden lotuses, fragrant and resplendent.
Let the assembly settle their minds,
That Daoists may endure long.
Together cultivating pure virtue beyond the stars,
When merit is complete in years to come, we shall ascend to audience with the Origin—
The late Master will surely grant the wine of immortality.

Within stillness, clamor; amid clamor, stillness—
Who discerns the wondrous workings of the numinous source?
Two inverted states merge into emptiness,
Naturally revealing the true message.

Qi traverses the Three Passes,
Spirit roams the Eight Extremities.
Ceaseless, traceless, it comes and goes—
Now cease seeking, abandon inquiry,
And all doubt shall vanish on the path ahead.

In praise of the Master’s immortal form, imperishable:
Jade bones, pristine in origin,
Golden elixir already perfected.
Eternal spring, ageless—what year could bring decay?
A single nature, rounded and complete, pervades the Ganges’ sands,
Yet the discarded husk remains whole, unchanged.

Rare across ten thousand generations,
Scarce in any age—
Disciples from the ends of heaven gather in haste.
Dwelling in peace, they venerate the true countenance,
Burning incense for a hundred thousand spans, three days unbroken.

*Six Poems in Crimson Dots*
Composed five days after the Double Ninth

The body enters emptiness,
Yet this alone cannot serve as proof.
On the path of true emptiness,
Qi and spirit converge—
The yang spirit emerges.

Should you meet a kindred soul,
This matter may be entrusted.
Hearken well, cast doubt aside:
When cultivation is complete, heaven itself shall guard you.

Again—

I hear of cultivation’s ways,
A thousand differences, ten thousand divergences—hard to rely upon.
On the path of true emptiness,
Who attains the essence?
Only one who lets go may return.

Deeds accumulate boundlessly,
Merit must reach three thousand.
With awakened heart,
Stroll freely on cloud-steps,
Ascending beyond celestial immortals.

Again—

Seeking the Dao, pursuing truth,
Calm the mind, endure the search for the right path.
The handle of the elixir knife—
Hosts of immortals rejoice,
A single luminous pearl gleams.

Illuminating the primordial origin,
Recognizing head and shadow as one—
Divine and sagely,
Within, pure joy abounds,
Beyond the world, idly chanting.

Again—

Cultivation is hard to achieve,
Ignorance stirs flames everywhere.
Summoning calamity,
Time slips by in vain—
How escape birth and death?

Awaken early to past transgressions,
No longer cling to self and others.
Return to truth,
Ever clearly discerning,
Set to work and reap the immortal fruit.

Again—

Radiant Double Yang,
Crisp autumn air stirs pure delight.
Singing immortal songs,
Yellow blossoms match the season,
Each petal reflecting true nature.

Small balustrades fragrant,
The assembly seated in reverence.
Truly serene,
Pure wind, untainted—
Ten thousand households, a thousand gates rejoice.

*Roaming Fiveflower Mountain in Late Spring, Following the Master’s Rhyme*

Yesterday’s spring outing,
Our company seemed to ride phoenix and simurgh.
Kindred spirits together,
Hearts at ease, we ventured forth,
Straight into the Peach Blossom Grotto.

By the clear stream,
Idly listening to the zither’s three refrains.
True joy stirs,
Freely welcomed and sent off—
What care for Zhuang Zhou’s dream?

*Divination Song*
At Jade Void Abbey’s night scene, the Master ordered all to hasten—
*Divination Song* was renamed *Northern Bliss*.

True nature, do not wander in vain,
The two substances ever guard each other.
Who knows this message?
It is having within nothing.

The jeweled tripod’s blossoms unfurl,
Jade doors radiate golden light.
Become one who has crossed to the cool other shore—
The work of purity is complete.

*Three Poems for the Sagely Dynasty*
After the Yizhou Ritual, Guo Zhiquan was commanded to expound two chapters on the Dao and virtue

Ancient bonds run deep,
Good roots planted firmly,
The steadfast heart of the aspirant.
Moved by our gate’s vast teaching,
Broadly opening the way—
Together we discourse on merit’s fulfillment.

Sleepless through the night,
Cloud-borne companions in lofty assembly,
Penetrating the profoundest mystery.
Within the five thousand characters,
Forget the fish-trap and grasp the fish—
Behold the immortal within yourself.

Deep in the quiet night, I don robes and sit at ease,
Listening to the stringless zither.
Ceasing lofty discourse, subtle words silently penetrate the mystery—
Freely abiding in the turtle’s unbroken breath.
Yin and yang rise and fall,
The four greats harmonize in balance,
Bones strong, spirit whole.
Embracing the primal origin, a single point completes the practice—
Behold the dancing immortal embryo.

*Mid-Autumn Moon Viewing at Taiping Xingguo Abbey*
The sea is calm, the mountains still,
Autumn’s pure light fills all,
A cool night gathers kindred souls.
We open our hearts,
Delighting past the third watch,
Further discoursing on the profound.
Perfect clarity dawns in sudden awakening,
Selfless and universally illuminating,
Virtuous deeds fully encompassed.
This very night, perceiving thoroughly, all natures interpenetrate—
Attaining the immortality of the solid earth.

*Ten Lyrics to "Yi Jian Mei"*
Following the rhyme of Master Yilaci Zhongze, composed at Yonghe Hermitage in Yizhou.

Only when the ninth nine-day period ends does the sun warm.
Spring harmonizes with lofty virtue,
Dreamless, the heavens stretch long.
Roaming freely through the ten directions and three realms,
Summer’s heat still met,
Unheeding autumn’s frost.

Awakened to true leisure, all affairs forgotten,
Naturally at ease and joyful,
The mind-ground cool and clear.
The original single point expands boundlessly,
Dispersing all demons,
Alone manifesting majestic radiance.

*Addressing the Assembly, Reusing the Previous Rhyme*
Externally accumulating hidden merit, internally fortifying yang.
The everlasting spring addresses the assembly—
These words are especially long.
If one can suddenly awaken to non-doing,
Past karma dissolves like frost beneath the blazing sun.

No need to still the mind or forget the six desires.
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled,
Transcending heat and cold.
Carefree and unconstrained, drifting east or west,
Thoroughly awakened to the human realm—
Thus concealing one’s brilliance.

*Addressing the Assembly at Taiping Xingguo Abbey*
Heaven bestows Pingyao as a fine place to rest the heart.
Jade halls lie hushed,
Ancient cypresses stand dense.
Cool shade tightly seals the grotto-heaven’s seclusion,
Villages nearby,
Yet quieter than mountain forests.

Who can seek the Way of purity and non-doing?
At Taiping Xingguo Abbey,
Find a true kindred spirit.
I urge you to swiftly awaken—do not delay.
Accept it in this very moment,
And the worthy and sagely will descend upon you.

*Sent to Daoist Friends in Weizhou*
Beyond the waters beside the immortal’s pot,
By the Western River we bade farewell,
Sincerity and depth unforgettable.
Unable to speak at leisure before setting out,
Crossing the ridge through bitter cold,
My coming intent hasty.

Fortunately, peace reaches the land of the Dao,
Hunyuan abounds in sufficiency,
All affairs at peace.
If someone travels east, send them new verses,
To report to kindred spirits
And reveal my conduct and whereabouts.

*Ode to the Front High Mountain*
Newly acquired, the front high mountain stands in a cluster.
A realm of pure emptiness,
An ancient immortal altar.
Heaven pities my arduous toil,
Granting me advanced years,
Teaching me to open my countenance.

Silently I thank the lofty vault for bestowing leisure.
Amid pines and upon rocks,
All pursuit is severed.
Joyfully content, delight knows no bounds—
Worthy to behold whether walking or sitting.

*Again*
Newly acquired, the front high mountain proclaims itself.
A realm of pure emptiness,
An ancient immortal altar.

Peaks rise sheer and towering,
Pines and cypresses stand in rows.
The Daoist’s plan to retreat from the red dust—
In the azure grotto, high and serene,
No affairs to bind the heart.

White hair hangs heavy, frost at both temples.
Within the shadow of green pines,
All adornment fades to remoteness.
Coming and going in playful ease as the sun slants low—
Walking brings coolness,
Sitting brings coolness.

*Again*
Who can know the newly gained Front High?
Its purity surpasses the world,
Yet the poet’s brush cannot capture it.
From the Peak of Morning Ascent, I gaze in idle leisure—
Before reaching Penglai,
I first arrive at Jasper Pool.

A gust of pine wind blows into my ears,
Celestial strains drift faintly,
Penetrating the subtle and profound.
When the mood strikes, I lean on my staff and wander the clouded stream—
Walking is fitting,
Sitting is fitting.

*Expressing My Feelings to Master Cheng*
My Dao studies bear no fruit, yet Heaven is not stingy.
I occupy an undeserved reputation,
Hard-pressed to claim true attainment.
From now on, my resolve redoubles—
Gazing east, I let all rest,
Never descending from the western mountain.

Deep gratitude to my steadfast friends,
Whose support in all four seasons never fails,
Providing me with clothing and food.
At times of celebration, ascending to Morning Ascent Peak,
Both merit and conduct perfected,
Daily attending a thousand altars.

*Expressing My Feelings to Master Liu*
A single spark of numinous clarity, originally still,
Flowing with whatever arises, responding to all conditions.
Recognizing all these as they are—
In motion, it is round;
In stillness, it is round.

In daily use, it is selfless and untouched by edges,
The subtle workings of pure emptiness—
This Dharma is worthy of transmission.
Guiding others to sudden awakening into non-action—
Walking, words forgotten;
Sitting, words forgotten.

*Descending the Mountain*
For love of Front High, I realize my excess.

Heaven-born barriers block the flow of harmonious qi.
Where lies the path ahead to seek the Dao’s affinity?
Without the fortune for leisure,
With the fate for toil—
Even in old age, merit remains incomplete, left to the whims of demons.

The Long Spring Teachings warn:
Beware of wasted time.
Those who from the start attain the Dao and study immortality—
Their merit is not great,
Their conduct is not great.

Too late to begin—

*Exhorting the Assembly After the Yizhou Ritual*
How can the myriad conditions ever cease?
When will the thousand cares ever quiet?
When emotions fade, all conditions suddenly end;
When thoughts vanish, all cares wholly cease.

Ask yourself: how much time remains?
Yet still you toy with worldly cleverness.
If you knew to turn your light inward now,
You would not wait in sorrow as misfortune nears.

*Zhaojun’s Resentment*
*Inscribed on the Eastern Wall of Dongzhi Abbey, Quanzhou*

On the Double Ninth, a leisurely stroll,
I arrive at Wuqing’s southern crossing.
Gazing afar at the auspicious scene—
Waters stretch boundless.

For days, overcast skies and gentle rain,
Now deep among the reeds.
Reveling amid the shifting waters and clouds,
I look toward West Mountain.

*Phoenix Perches on the Wutong Tree*
*Observing the World*

The Great Teaching spreads throughout the world,
Returning to simplicity, preserving the True—
In daily practice, offering expedient means.
Expedient true compassion, pure and still in vow,
The heart connects, gradually sensing worldly ties grow distant.

The superior person, wise and enlightened, is easily persuaded.
Having awakened to the mysterious wind,
Swiftly forget knowledge and perception.
How can worldly affairs be long cherished?
Better to recognize and verify the original face.

*Concluding the Lower Scroll of Preserving the Light*
