Blood circulates throughout the body and flows through the four limbs, harmonizing with the principles of yin and yang, adapting to the suitability of high and low. When regulated, it flows smoothly; when obstructed, it stagnates—this is like water. Water, as a substance, flows within the earth, courses through rivers, lakes, and marshes, and enters the sea. Its circulation depends on such a nature. Those who skillfully nurture life rely on qi to move it.

Moreover, water can carry a boat or sink it. The function of blood and vessels can likewise bring life or death. The superior practitioner embodies blood and qi, seeking their principles in water, discerning the yin and yang of hands and feet, knowing their origins and destinations. Observing the marvels of water—its bends and turns, its hidden depths, its weakness and strength, its division into solitary streams, its gathering into deep pools, its evaporation into clouds, its condensation into rain—those who grasp the principles of blood and vessels do so in the same way.

Thus, blood arises from the navel and flows through the four limbs. It originates in the heart, returns to the head, and gathers in the kidneys, each with its corresponding union. For instance, the small and large intestines correspond to the Yangtze and Huai Rivers; the heart and pericardium correspond to the Zhang and Ying Rivers. By extending these marvels and mapping them, the principles of interconnected meridians, the arts of dispersion and convergence, and the circulation of flow are rooted in the Dao.

The Immortal Ge Zhongqing said: "Human blood is like the earth’s water, flowing from streams into the Yangtze and Han Rivers, reaching the great sea. The sea transforms all waters. The *Weilü* (Tail Gate) drains and connects to heaven, moved by primordial qi. The circulation of blood and vessels pervades the four limbs, flowing from the fingers and toes to the heart, tracing its vital origins. It is born from the navel, ascends to the liver, governs the heart’s central palace, opens and closes to disperse through the lung’s proper position. The spleen is its root, now called the ‘Blood Mother.’ The Blood Mother is the spleen, which stores and unites with the lakes below. The kidneys are the sea. The sea gathers all blood, where it transforms into true essence and generates primordial qi. Primordial qi moves blood to circulate, thus ascending to the head. The black hair of the head is like heaven’s clouds; its dispersion as sweat is like heaven’s rain. When rain is balanced, it is proper; when excessive or deficient, it brings harm. The Way of nurturing life, knowing heaven’s workings, is primarily drawn from the movements of the sun and moon—yet how few understand that water, too, follows the Dao!"

Master Fu the Recluse said: "Have you not observed cooking? By observing cooking, the art of the cauldron is complete. Fire is primordial qi; water is blood. When steamed, raw becomes cooked—this is the transformation of the five viscera. Its qi ascends to pay homage to the heavenly palace. In the moment between uncooked and cooked, water flows downward—this is the Yellow Sprout and White Snow. Be cautious: if the flame is too fierce, the food burns; if undercooked, the pot leaks. If qi does not respond, the cauldron’s water dries; if struck, it resonates—this is the principle of nature."

Master Yinxuan, versed in the creation of channel-waters, followed the Daoist principle: "From the Dao comes the One, from the One comes Two, from Two comes Three, and from Three come the ten thousand things." Adapting to the five phases, he grasped the root and branches of the Water Scripture. It is said that parents give birth, but qi varies in thickness, and timing differs in earliness and lateness. By determining the waxing and waning of water and vessels, one aligns them with the five viscera, verifying them against the waters within the earth. Thus, kidney water corresponds to the sea, spleen water to lakes, lung water to rivers, and liver water to the Ji River—each has its proper course. Their branches have their paths, their sources have their returns. By creating diagrams, the principles of channel-waters are understood.

The movement of qi is the primordial warp; the movement of blood is the Water Scripture. Knowing the pathways of blood—how it circulates through the body, converges in the five viscera, and its origins and returns—is to know how rivers connect to heaven, heaven to the sea, the sea to Kunlun, and how the Yellow River flows backward.

**The Primordial Descended Diagram**

Zizi said: "Human life, born from parents at different times and with varying endowments, is predetermined by calculation—and thus the Great Elixir is revealed. Calculation refers to the year, month, day, and hour. For those born from their parents’ conception, first determine the accumulated years of their birth, then the strategies of the Qian and Kun hexagrams, then the number of the Great Expansion. Divide by 360, and the remainder by the four seasons to know the origin of the Water Scripture. Trace it through the five viscera to know its beginning. Knowing the beginning, one then gives life—this is the mechanism of heaven and earth."

Yuan Zhiji said: "What flows through the body is blood. Blood circulates to moisten the four limbs. Those conceived by parents with superior endowments have blood that arises first. Thus, some have luxuriant hair into old age, black beards and whiskers without relying on medicinal cultivation, preserving both yin and yang for years. Those who decline prematurely before their prime must know the origin and limits of their calculation to properly apply it. Dredge and differentiate, circulate and move it, regulate and block it—like Yu controlling the waters. Then one’s Water Scripture can be grasped intuitively and reasoned through."

Lady Wu of Fufeng said: "The principles of water begin with the sea accumulating solitary streams to form rivers, connecting to heaven. Heaven draws from the sea, and the tides respond to geography, each with its own pattern."

Moreover, to speak of the blood circulating throughout the body: its measure spans thirty-six thousand five hundred *zhang*, like threads within a basket—never disordered, ever governed by principle and order. I have often used the generative numbers—Water as one, Fire as two, Wood as three, Metal as four, Earth as five—to expound their fullness, and by their completion numbers, to discuss their ultimate reckoning. From each number beginning at one *chi* down to one *fen*, I have traced and examined them thoroughly. From the Summer Solstice, the tides respond by receding; from the Winter Solstice, the tides respond by advancing—each in perfect accord. Now, the highs and lows of the earth’s terrain are revealed by observing the sea tides, each differing in its place. The thickness or thinness of a person’s *qi* is determined by the year, month, day, and hour of their parents’ birth—each arising differently.

The enlightened scholar, through numbers, awakens to the Dao. How could the Dao, fused within the body, distinguish between inner and outer? Master Hu An was once a tide-rider, knowing the subtleties of tides—whether early or late, advancing or retreating, fierce or gentle, swift or slow—stepping upon the waters without fear. Liu Yanqing sought to learn the art of tide-riding, and Master An responded with the theory of yin and yang in the hands and feet, bestowing upon him the *Five Viscera Bronze Figure* and the *Tortoise Mirror*. After nine years, Liu could tread the waters, his movements in entering, exiting, departing, and returning without error.

Master Xu of Danyang said: "How vast are the tides of the sea!" Thereupon, he devoted thirty years to investigating the wonders of tidal resonance, mastering the Dao of the *Water Scripture*, and thus composed the *Water Scripture*.
