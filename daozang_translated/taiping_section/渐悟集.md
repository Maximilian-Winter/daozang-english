**Congratulating the Sage’s Advent (Two Poems)**
*Presented to Minister Wang*

**I.**
Auspicious mist and blessed *qi* ever spread,
the heart then returns to its primal plain.
The world pursues—yet I abide in non-doing,
thoughtless, careless, free of strain.
Crimson chamber gathers the Maiden and Infant,
their wisdom-eyes watch crow and hare.
The *Kǎn* and *Lí* palaces intertwine—
who among these grasps such affair?

**II.**
Robe of paper, hempen cloth, plain attire,
firmly rooted in the original simplicity.
Before the wind, beneath the moon, I strum the heart’s lute,
untainted by the slightest dust of worry.
Cloud-companions, radiance-friends ever gather,
watching the flying crow, the running hare.
Within the jade, the purple-golden elixir ripens—
who among these grasps such affair?

---

**Picking Mulberries (No. 1)**
*Leaving Home to Enter the Dao*

Fúfēng’s Quán Dào bore the name Tōngyī,
his Daoist title: Carefree.
Beholding a painted skull,
he fiercely gathered his mind—all affairs ceased.
At forty-six, frost silvered his temples,
he brushed his sleeves and wandered the clouds.
No need for stubborn clinging—
it’s like the deadline of impermanence arriving at last.

**II.**
Corpse-walking bones, chasing fame and gain,
fate’s decree is fixed and firm.
They heed not the body’s frame,
skin and skeleton their funeral home.
I urge men to sever the cords of clinging,
leap from the red furnace’s flame.
Restore the primordial state—
there’s a mountain rustic who lends his strength.

**III.**
The mountain rustic cast off the worldly, sought the mysterious,
tying true and good causes.
Deep gratitude to the Perfected Master—
thus he became a carefree, unbound man.

I now vow never to return east,
to die in Western Qin.
Though my bones turn to dust,
they’ll not be buried by sons and grandsons by the sea.

**[Dream-Awakening]**
Master Chongyang admonished and guided me in a hundred ways,
yet I remained entangled in attachments.
One night, I dreamed I stood in the central courtyard, sighing:
"My life is like a delicate porcelain bowl—
one slip and it shatters into a hundred pieces."
Before the words were finished, the bowl fell from the sky,
and I awoke with a startled cry.
The next day, the Master said:
"Your terror last night was the first glimmer of awakening."

Lü Dongbin awoke from the Yellow Millet Dream,
abandoned his gilded carriage,
returned to the root, restored the source—
all through Master Zhongli’s alchemy.

The mountain rustic, struck by the porcelain dream,
severed the cords of clinging,
refined mercury, simmered lead—
through the Immortal of the Wind’s nature, the moon became full.

**IV.**
The name appears before the truth is revealed,
a lamentable affair.
It uproots the foundation of the Dao—
who can one blame for losing the primordial state?
Better to be dull and awakened than clever and deluded,
to play the fool,
to act without contrivance,
to cease weaving idle words or composing verses.

Vows I made—barefoot through summer, never drinking cool water;
through winter, never facing fire’s glow.
Now I swear within these encircling walls:
in summer, I renounce all cooling springs;
in winter, I scorn the reddened embers.
I recognize the true crucible’s water-and-fire affinity.
Longing to repay my Master’s grace, I cultivate with diligence,
refining mercury, simmering lead.
When deeds are complete and merit full,
I shall become a barefoot immortal of Penglai’s isles.

*Tune: "Exploring Spring"*
For Wang Zhixuan

Within the grotto-heaven, several rounds of pure, pure rain—
pointing afar to the jade forest, worth beholding.
A single jade staff, following as I walk,
discovers within my nature the golden lotus blooming.
Youthful maiden and radiant woman come to gather,
joined by the true dragon and tiger.
Naturally, it manifests—
auspicious light covering all,
a single luminous sovereign.

*Cherishing the Fragrant Season: Two Poems*
For Officer Li

You and I, born in the same *gui-mao* year,
unaware that fifty-two years have flowed past.
I entered the Dao first, delving into profound principles,
naturally unwilling to leave you behind.
Day and night without distinction, I constantly attend to it,
scribbling verses and songs on a thousand sheets of paper.
I urge you to early abandon worldly ties,
lest you stumble at the Yellow Springs’ edge.

For Wu Yu, the Desireless, Guardian of Compassion

Pure, pure, and serene—auspicious clouds at their feet.
Within the nine apertures, they interweave and traverse.
Who knows the wondrous function arises from non-action?
Naturally, the principle refines into the elixir.
The black dragon spits forth a divine pearl, resplendent,
revealing ten thousand rays of rosy light enveloping all.
The empty hall gleams, its radiance enhanced—
some promise awaits on Penglai’s path.

*Three Poems to the Tune "Willow Branches"*
For Zhao Daoji

Within the day, the golden rooster crows once,
startling the dream awake.
On the pillow, a lingering coolness from the pure breeze,
the wine just sobered.
Mist rolls back, clouds gather—the sky like water,
the moon newly bright.
The empty hall, silent, utterly free of dust’s passions—
the nature just leveled.

*For the Four Masters of the Countryside*

A *Willow Branches* verse I sweep clean,
to whom shall I send it?
To the one Yan, one Hao, and two Liu Immortals,
I pour forth these words.
Best to join Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma,
together to delve into the profound.
When the nine returns and seven reversals complete their work,
go to pay homage at the origin.

For Yunzhongzi, Su Xuan

Fiercely abandoning glory, wife, and children,
awakening to the mystery’s mechanism.
Drifting, drifting—utterly at ease in non-action,
playing the fool.
No wandering through cloud and water on fragrant grass paths—
within, I uphold the practice.
When merit is complete and deeds full,
alone, where shall I go?
I shall hasten to the Jasper Pool.

*Six Poems to the Tune "Fisherman’s Pride"*
Awakening to Myself

**Dreaming of My Beloved Wife**

I dreamed my tender wife called me "mother,"
and met my cherished concubine—she called me "daughter."
All because in past lives my heart knew no awakening.
*Knew no awakening—*
only to change faces and become husband and wife.

From this, ever trembling in the mountain wilds,
how could I bear further deliverance by Immortal Feng?
I must purify myself and practice purity.
*Practice purity—*
where purple mushrooms mark the far shore, the path to the profound.

**Again**

Seventy years of light—how many days remain?
At most, twenty-five thousand days.
Each day passed leaves one less.
*One less—*
soon this body will be like the sun setting on Western Mountain.

If I do not cultivate the Dao, I waste my days in vain.
Once awakened, how could I idle till my end?
I turn the wheel of the Grotto-Heaven’s true sun and moon.
*True sun and moon—*
in the Moon Palace, I lift the crimson sun.

**To Sister Sun**

I urge you, Sister Sun, to cultivate the Great Dao,
ever sweeping clean the field of your heart.
Slay the Three Corpses and the Six Wastrels.
*Free from affliction—*
ever pure, ever still, you will know the mystery’s depths.

Ask not of strange names for furnace or hearth—
harmony rises and falls, inverting all.
Lead and mercury naturally form the supreme treasure.
*Most excellent—*
clouds of rosy light will escort you to Penglai Isle.

**To My Fellow Practitioners**

I urge you, kindred spirits, to heed me closely:
abstaining from meat and wine is wholly within reach.
Disdaining fleeting wealth is but a trifling matter.
*Yet deeply perilous—*
the slightest touch may rouse the flame of ignorance.

By and large, desire for form is hard to cast aside;
you must resolve to sever it yourself.
Treat it as a foe, as a living ghost.
*Best to keep far away—*
even in dreams, you must shun it.

**Again**

I charge the kitchen master to do good always,
diligently offering sustenance without wearying.
Do not pour boiling broth upon the ground.
*Let it cool—*
lest you harm the ants that pass by.

In daily use of firewood, rice, and flour,
neither waste nor stint—let there be no excess.
Within and without, keep pure, forgetting worldly thoughts.
*Truly admirable—*
in time, you may dwell in the immortals’ courts.

**Again**

An ox pulls a heavy cart on a treacherous road,
yet the driver heeds not the hardship.
He strikes harder with the whip, but the ox will not move.
*Will not move—*
suddenly, the ox speaks in human words:

"You toil to feed your family while I suffer.
Now I must plead with you in pity.
If in this life your heart does not awaken,
*Does not awaken—*
then in the next, *I* shall be *you*."

**Two Poems to the Tune "Green Willow Tips"**

*Matching an Ancient Verse*

Awakened to the unborn and undying,
I refuse to pluck flowers or gather leaves.
Joyful, I sing aloud,
drunk, I sleep on fragrant grass,
dreaming of wandering the immortals’ palaces.

At times, I exhort all people—
do not wonder at my earnest, repeated pleas.
Walking corpses, bone-bags,
greedy for wealth, racing after desire,
they squander their years in vain.

**Again**

*Hidden Head*

□ The wheel does not hasten birth or death.

□ within the flame, lotus blooms with five petals.
□ attains the golden flower, □ forms the magic herb,
□ divides without lack.
□ born Ma Yu, a foolish man,
□ suddenly awakened—his family ties cut deep.
□ split the mountain of grace, □ illumined for ages,
□ discoursed on the moon of the heart.

**Two Poems to the Tune "Welcoming Spring Joy"**

*For Master Ru*

Within the body, timely signs ascend in purity and elegance—
why need the pitch-pipes or clay oxen?
The herb-field relies on clouds to plow through,
no longer requiring the plowman’s hand.
Cultivating life and spreading virtue, the work is complete,
golden sprouts bloom everywhere, surpassing flowers and willows.
The Jade Grotto bears the immortal embryo—
naturally, one drinks the wine of longevity.

*For Master Liu*

The Dipper’s handle turns, first arriving at *Zhen*,
naturally, yang qi surges and swells.
How can the blue bird’s tidings be endured?
The earth-ox strikes—know the season’s division.
The sun travels the western path, golden light gleaming,
golden sprouts and auspicious herbs, magic fungi moistened.
Delighting in the nine-returned elixir,
opening the jade feast—all should be in perfect order.

**To the Tune "Jade Tower Spring"**

*For Jiang Daoquan*

The master drinks the jade nectar’s wine,
reclines beneath the moon, sleeps among clouds, idly toying with the Dipper.
Timely, he revolves the mechanism without error—
this work depends on the craftsman’s hand.
A hall filled with gold and jade, existing within nothingness,
the nation prosperous, the people at peace, spirit and qi refined.
The jade tower’s spring colors are wondrous indeed—
not the orioles, flowers, or green willows.

**To the Tune "Palace of Night Travel"**

Seeing through worldly toil, bitter and relentless,
delighting in purity and leisure, freely singing and dancing.
Like a solitary cloud, coming and going.
No entanglements—attaining carefree ease,
within, self-replenished.
Day and night, harmonizing dragon and tiger,
constantly, the maiden and infant gather.
Cultivating the divine pearl, it emits light from emptiness.
Radiating brilliance—
revealing the original beginning,
the master of form.

**To the Tune "Jade Hall Spring"**

Idly discussing cultivation—
cultivation is no trifling matter.
Fiercely abandoning family ties,
only then seeking the Great Dao.
Extinguishing all ignorance,
like *Ke*, nurturing the vast.
Willing to follow human sentiments like a well-sweep?
Dwelling in a wren’s nest, eating scraps—
naturally free from vexation.
A grimy face, disheveled hair,
the field of the heart frequently swept.
Metal and wood mutually engender—
within, the supreme treasure is formed.
Then, the divine light emits a single ray.
Treading the clouds, walking...

**Thirty Poems to the Tune "Treading Clouds" #2**

*For Immortals Cao, Gan, and Zhang, Dwelling Together in Misty Rosy Grotto*

Two counties, three immortals,
one heart, dwelling together,
passing down the profoundest words in turn.
By the water-cloud stream, joyfully carefree,
within Misty Rosy Grotto, thoughts forgotten.
Refining mercury, cooking lead,
harmonizing dragon, guiding tiger,
in stillness, uniting the true lords of the three fields.
The work complete, riding a crane to pay homage to the Origin—
in the Great Luo Heaven, becoming immortal companions.

**Further Verses to the Tune "Treading Clouds"**

Another:
A carefree idler, a careless hero,
in poverty and joy, worldly matters forgotten.
Before the wind, beneath the moon, plucking the heart’s zither,
dragon’s chants and tiger’s roars come to attend.
Now hidden in mountain forests, now dwelling in bustling markets,
urging others to turn their heads—each step is the Way.
Amid the dust, guiding and transforming, forging good karmic ties;
cloud companions and rosy friends await in anticipation.

*For Lü Shouzhen*
This maiden,
a banished immortal surnamed Lü,
willing to trade bones as a merchant.
Disheveled hair, grimy face—Daoist bearing,
cloud companions and rosy friends, no ordinary fellowship.
Do not flaunt your appearance,
a lump of foul decay—
affection shattered not by axe or adze.
Heart extinguished, thoughts severed, joy unbounded,
in the Great Luo Heaven, dwelling in the immortal palace.

Another:
Six-petaled flurries drift,
a thousand peaks lie in hidden emerald,
jade blossoms fallen to earth, stirred by the wind.
Through curtains and screens, flaunting their freedom,
before men, deliberately displaying auspicious signs.
The fisherman dons his straw cloak,
Ziyou’s mood arises,
the price of wine in Gaoyang soars.
Why do the people rejoice so?—
next year will surely be a year of abundance.

*For Feng Shouci*
Though kin by blood,
life and death cannot be crossed.
Fleeting fame, fleeting gain—like drifting clouds.
All ties cast aside, as if nonexistent,
on the path of longevity, cultivating the immortal fruit.
Jade doors often opened,
golden gates tightly sealed,
the spirit pearl veiled, scriptures recited.
Work complete, lightly ascending, treading the clouds,
in the Great Luo Heaven, seated in solemn dignity.

Another:
Reencountering Chongyang,
layer upon layer, awakening to the Dao,
the lad from Fufeng—why fear aging?
Harmonizing dragon, guiding tiger, toying with the bright pearl,
the bright pearl’s path must emerge early.
Named *Yu*, styled *Xuanbao*,
the title *Cloud Master* earned as a fine sobriquet.
The Wooden Ox’s childhood name: *Shantong*,
*Shantong* will soon ascend as an immortal.

Another:
Returning to Xingping,
broadening the path of words,
suddenly, interest spent, thoughts turn to home.
Treading the mossy path, counting the way to Chang’an,
wishing all would awaken their hearts early.
Wealth and poverty decreed by heaven,
descendants’ fortunes inscribed in shadow,
calculations set—cease all worry.
Hearing the body is sound, hasten to cultivate;
with sincerity, seek a true master’s guidance.

*For the Idle Daoist of Wuwei*
The three-topknot *Shantong*, bowing to hear Zhang’s teaching,
watching others make offerings—this is not the way.
Do not envy the fat carp by the river’s edge;
retreat and cast your net—better than gazing.
To dwell in Penglai,
why wait in anticipation?
Disheveled hair, grimy face, worldly matters forgotten.
Burning incense, bowing a hundred times to the original heart,
vowing to follow in the footsteps of Master Pang.

*For Yaji Yao Xuanyu*
Within the twin topknots,
brightness and fortune concealed,
the master’s name worn on the crown—do not alter it.
Long ago, Zhongli was just the same;
can Yao’s emulation lack benefit?
The candle of nature refined to perfection,
the lamp of life trimmed and bright,
the spirit’s light shining boundlessly.
The *Immortal-Welcoming Guest* sings *Treading Clouds*,
in the moonlit jade terrace, striking the mark.

*Matching the Master’s Rhyme*
The master’s verse for Immortal Tan:
*Zhang drinks wine, Li arrives,*
*Li seizes Zhang’s cup and drinks.*
Struck by inspiration, Yu humbly responds:
Vast and free,
detailed and precise,
why must the immortals’ words be so?

The Mountain Recluse sees himself as a giant turtle-fish,
golden scales gleaming like fresh brocade in the sun.
Roaming clouds and waters at will,
body and mind freely given,
why vie to be the foremost adept?
All rejoice at the coming of the white-robed one—
in the mystery within mystery, wine should be shared.

*Master Leads Ma Yu to Beg in the Streets*
No need to speak of turtle-hair,
no need to discuss rabbit-horns—
the illusory body’s idle thoughts are but a cicada’s husk.
How then might one reveal the golden countenance?
All lies in the heart’s awareness.
Unwavering resolve,
the Dao not distant,
the cave-heaven’s white snow turns to crimson hail.
Transformed into a carefree spirit-child,
naturally grasping the elixir of immortality.

*Tea*
A peerless grade, its name most fitting,
dispelling sleep’s thoughts with boundless merit.
Confucius no longer dreams of the Duke of Zhou—
the Mountain Recluse laughs heartily at Chen Tuan’s boast.
Lu Tong’s seven bowls,
Master Zhaozhou—
both knew its supreme savor.
Had Zai Yu tasted but one cup,
he’d never nap by day, his spirit clear and bright.

*The Daoist Requests*
Eastern cloth of misty creepers,
western rows of snow willows,
the Qin River and Wei waters add fresh beauty.
In all directions golden lotuses surge,
auspicious light and propitious qi gently descend.
Nine cycles of refinement,
instant completion—
naturally the Jade Palace stands leak-proof.
The Three Pure Ones sit high on jeweled flower thrones—
who knows this scene arises from nothingness?

*Attending Lord Liu’s Feast*
Jade nectar and fine wine,
blended with jade shards,
piling the jade table with ice and snow.
Rely on the jade staff as skilled craftsman,
kneading jade cakes, lightly layered.
Suddenly hearing golden chimes,
golden blades slice finely,
golden stoves ceaselessly simmer.
Fragrant and soft, feeding the golden ox—
once sated, the golden ox knows no birth or death.

*Grapes*
Roots coiled like dragons,
tendrils twining,
branch by branch, leaf by leaf, lush and green.
The Three Luminaries shine upon the cloud-canopied vines,
among them, several clusters of extraordinary treasure.
At first like lapis lazuli,
finally like agate,
clustered and dense, round and small.
Like prayer beads, lest thieves steal—
Ma Feng ate them and returned to Penglai Isle.

*Again*
Three topknots towering,
a singular immortal’s bearing,
fitting to wear flowers of blue, yellow, and white.
This Daoist intent few understand—
Ma Feng once more receives the direct transmission.
To cultivate and uphold,
follow the method and rule,
days and months passing through the meridians.
Refining lead and mercury to form the golden elixir,
completing merit and fulfilling the journey as a Penglai guest.

*Bamboo Blind for the Quanzhen Hall*
White blades held taut,
blue silk as thread,
warp and weft meticulously aligned.
The work complete, dare not hang it beneath the thatched eaves—
in the Quanzhen Hall, it hangs for convenience.
Shielding from worldly clamor,
inner truth self-evident,
leisurely, no need for others to roll it up.
The moon’s hook high, angling into azure skies—
then all will vie to see the visage of Fufeng.

*Again*
Ma Yu’s lifelong nature,
heart level and disposition kind,
drawn out by his master from Muping County.
Roaming carefree and unburdened through Dongping,
safe and sound, body hale and hearty.
Reaching Xingping,
governing with peace in mind,
joyful and serene, free from strife.
Cloud-wandering the earth veins of the Taiping Palace,
steadily and surely practicing convenience.

*Again*
Occasionally the heart brightens,
naturally the spirit responds—
a pearl emerges from the black dragon’s jaws.
True constancy ever manifest and clear,
nature unimpeded, no darkness.
In worldly dealings, frugal and ungreedy—
how dare I claim such?
Wrapped in a worn robe, content.
Vying for fame and profit, you surpass me;
sleeping among clouds and moon, I surpass you.

*The Daoist of the Zhenwu Temple Requests*
Zhenwu conceals his mechanism,
the Perfected Lord discards the false—
glory, wealth, and honor must be relinquished.
Wielding the sword of wisdom to slay the Three Corpses,
tortoise and snake unite in welcome.
Spirit responsive and luminous,
divine clarity and refined elegance—
knowing white, guarding black, a few words suffice.
May all awaken and tread the cloud path,
happily accompanying Fufeng’s Ma.

*Thanking Master Uncle Li for the Shoes*
Exalted Master,
Master surnamed Li,
pitying my distant homeland, three thousand leagues away.
Your teachings’ savor surpasses jade nectar—
reflecting, not inferior to King Yuan’s sweet wine.
Bestowing me with shoes,
shoes yet not mere footwear—
concealing mechanism, transmitting profound principle.
Henceforth, no parting from the red dust,
with karmic affinity, ascending into azure skies.

*To Luo Jindao, Formerly a Blacksmith*
Leaping from the red furnace,
body free from burns,
roaming water and clouds, not adrift.
Morning and evening tuning the natural zither,
its pure savor surpassing butter and cheese.
Beckoning the spirit-child,
ever joyful in communion—
eight streams of flowing water form garlands.
Who now occupies this family’s way?
Know that newly entering the Dao brings lasting bliss.

*To Lord Zhang*
At the age of unconfusion,
the heart should remain unmoved,
ever mindful of jade handcuffs and golden willows’ weight.
A single misstep of impermanence brings sorrow—
awakening, swiftly plant good causes.
Abandoning vigilance,
becoming dull and muddled—
refine the inner visage, frequently inspecting offerings.
Completing merit and fulfilling the journey, depart to pay homage to the Origin—
auspicious clouds cushion your steps, fragrant winds escort you.

*Returning Home*
Ancestors, four brothers,
at the end of the Tang, left for Shandong—
one settled in Laiyang, one in Huang County,
one in Wendeng, one in Muping.
Ancestors dwelled in Yunyang,
beneath Cuo’e Mountain,
living by the rhythms of *zhi* and *hu* since time immemorial.
Yet at the Tang’s end, they left for Dongmu—
to this day, over three hundred years have passed.
Generations of decline and prosperity,
too much to recount—
now, encountering the relinquishing of family ties.
Roaming water and clouds, entering Tong Pass,
transcendently revealing the returning-home Ma.

*For Wu Shouzhi’s Birthday Feast*
Respectfully writing the blue prayer,
solemnly performing the yellow register rites,
with fragrant tea, wine, fruit, and candles.
Bell tones and chime rhythms pierce azure skies—
the liturgy’s details duly proclaimed.
Auspicious qi swirling,
propitious smoke fragrant and dense—
golden lads and jade maidens swiftly convey the words.
Not only longevity surpassing pines and bamboos,
the benevolent may share in immortal blessings.

*Again*
The chamber cool throughout,
the hall filled with merit—
in all directions, no obstructions.
A myriad rays of spiritual light issue from Kunlun—
how dare I boast of immortal stature before others?

Silent, wordless,
heart reduced to ashes—yet with principle:
my name already inscribed in Hua Xu’s land.
Carefree and at ease, gazing upon Chang’an,
golden blossoms and jade elixirs personally gathered.

*In Gratitude for Master Yu’s Shoes*
Stepping into the Mystery Gate,
leading back the white carp,
composing verses to thank our companion’s tread.
From now on, step by step beyond the red dust,
with no heart to linger gazing at peach and plum.

Seeking the subtle,
searching for the ultimate truth,
through the master’s guidance, awakening to leave home.
One day, merits complete, treading clouds in ascent,
inviting you to join within the azure skies.

*Again*
Ears attuned to golden scriptures,
mouth savoring jade cakes,
hand holding the ivory brush to inscribe the heart’s seal.
Though myriad affairs vie for attention,
true suchness remains unmoved, ever pure.

To attain spiritual clarity,
one must polish the inner mirror,
abiding in the world yet unstained—truly responsive.
When truly responsive, the embryonic immortal appears;
when the embryonic immortal appears, true constancy is settled.

*Again*
Seizing the soaring crow,
firmly capturing the fleeing hare—
the two wheels of sun and moon ever conjoined.
Radiance illumines the cavern-heaven,
pure rain descends like sweet dew.
Dispelling floating clouds,
leaving only wispy mist,
immortals of Penglai often encountered.
Henceforth, the Daoist name is Dan Yang;
in time, surely ascending to the Origin.

*For Master Xue (Hidden Head Poem)*
□ dare lightly transmit,
□ guard the secret formula,
□ discourse—how could it compare to ordinary speech?
□ fields quake with Kan and Li’s gathering,
□ pearls, each one requiring regulation.
□ gentleman and fair lady,
□ suddenly parting,
□ jade tablet to refine at the Golden Gate.
□ Ma Yu, born, treading clouds in ascent,
□ earnestly admonishing you: still the mind-monkey.

*Eight Lyrics to the Tune "Divining the Scholar"*
People know Mountain Recluse’s name,
but who fathoms Mountain Recluse’s intent?
The great form of Mountain Recluse leans on mountains,
thus crafting Mountain Recluse’s riddles.
The leopard’s mien, Mountain Recluse abandons;
the profound mystery, Mountain Recluse conceals.
One day, Mountain Recluse’s joy in the Dao complete,
eternally occupying Mountain Recluse’s place.

*Again*
Swallows arrive as Clear Bright nears,
flowers bloom at Clear Bright’s height.
I urge those who roam on Clear Bright’s day:
another Clear Bright’s scene awaits.
I attain Clear Bright’s eternity,
through kalpas, Clear Bright’s purity.
A single point of Clear Bright—priceless treasure—
is Clear Bright’s very nature.

*Again*
I speak for Mid-Autumn,
do not celebrate Mid-Autumn’s festival.
The outer scene of Mid-Autumn brings no benefit;
the inner scene of Mid-Autumn differs.
When the heart reaches Mid-Autumn’s rest,
the dust is severed at Mid-Autumn.
Gold meets Mid-Autumn to congeal the Great Elixir—
nature like the Mid-Autumn moon.

*Again*
Sweeping the Yang Pass road,
opening wide the Yang Pass door.

This Yang Pass bears not a speck of dust,
fit to bid farewell to Yang Pass companions.
Having grasped Yang Pass’s delight,
how could one dwell in Yang Pass?
Releasing Yang Pass’s perfected Daoist,
awakening arises from Yang Pass’s insight.

*Again*
Master’s name is Chongyang,
having refined Chongyang’s treasure.
The purple decree summons Chongyang to Jade Capital—
only then does Chongyang’s excellence appear.
I arrive for Chongyang’s sake,
the hut built for Chongyang’s dwelling.
Especially to keep vigil for Chongyang’s observance,
in accord with Chongyang’s Way.

*Again*
I met Chongyang and awakened,
once tasted Chongyang’s delight.
Refining Chongyang to extinguish all yin,
yin adheres to Chongyang’s touch.
Life and nature gather in Chongyang,
the Three Luminaries aid Chongyang.
Without reaching Chongyang, one cannot become immortal—
immortality is made by Chongyang alone.

*Matching the Master’s Rhyme*
Karma heavy with many calculations,
how could one awaken to hexagrams and judgments?
Deep gratitude to Wind Immortal for coming especially,
rousing this dull and foolish one.
Anger and resentment often bring hardship,
the lamp of nature must be made to shine.
True joy, true delight scatter all sorrow—
master and disciple ever companions.

*Song of the Overheated Horse*
All day pulling the salt cart,
whips and rods striking ceaselessly.
I sigh—my spirit long suppressed,
like a sick horse, how can I ever roam freely?
Bo Le, the master physiognomist, arrives,
seeing me, he sighs in surprise again and again.
With clever plans and many ways, he ransoms my body—
the horse that has found its will
must repay the master’s kindness.

*Again*
The Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
below the realm, blow the dragon flute.
Suddenly hearing the roar of the Kaiyuan tiger,
Wind Earl and Rain Master fall silent.
Utmost filial piety supports a widowed mother,
the red brocade snake swallows the soft-shelled turtle.
The Six-Road Green Ox pulls the treasure carriage—
manifesting sacred merit in truth.

*Again*
I have no heart for seeking office,
only responding to the Three Pures’ summons.

Zhong and Lü, Heaven’s appointed examiners,
judge not by poetry or rhapsody.
They weigh true cultivation and discipline—
three thousand deeds of merit and conduct.
Those who align with the Profound and Invisible attain spontaneity,
their names inscribed in the Register of Divine Immortals.
Then freely roam—*(Tiren Jiao)*

*To Han Shouxuan*
Freely roam, roam freely at will.
Roaming freely, untrammeled, without care.
Moving or sitting, roam freely,
freely roaming as if drunk.
Roaming wherever one pleases,
like clouds, like water.
Awakened to free roaming,
freely roaming to nurture qi.
Within free roaming, devise the plan for immortal cultivation.
This free roaming,
unmatched in its freedom.
Freely roam away—to Peng Isle and the Ten Continents, find your place.

*Longing for the Immortal (Chang Xiangsi)* Two + Three Poems

*Tea*
First flush tea, second leaf tea.
Do not offer to the scheming, fame-and-profit household.
Sleeplessness makes it a burden.

Wuwei tea, natural tea.
Heaven bestows it to ease the mind of Daoist households.
Sleeplessness enhances merit and conduct.

*Again*
Purple Ganoderma decoction, purple Ganoderma decoction.
With each brewing, fragrance arises anew.
One cup—all affairs forgotten.

Divine Cinnabar decoction, divine Cinnabar decoction.
After drinking, host and guest part ways.
Carrying clouds, the Jade Emperor appears.

*To Liu Chuxuan, Also Presented to Meng Siyuan*
Observe Yang Liu, observe Yang Liu.
With a fortune staff, heart steadfast, he occupies the riverbank.
Sleeping on clouds, pillowing against the current.

Ten thousand entanglements cease, ten thousand entanglements cease.
Metal and wood mutually engender, nature turns gentle.
The elixir perfected, he departs for the Ten Continents.

Dream of the Yellow Emperor, abandon fields and gardens.
Hard to follow Yi Gate’s Meng Siyuan.
Only cultivate the full moon of inner nature.

Tame the monkey-mind, recognize the root source.
A small serpent gazes down upon the turtle.
Yang Chunli of Taiyuan.

*Again*
Encounter Chongyang, herd the green sheep.
Shun empty fame, let it spread far and wide.
Only cultivate the sunlit nature.

Admire Xun and Yang, delight in the drifting.
Vast and boundless, vast and boundless.
The wind of *Tongxuan* feigns harm.

To Nanjing, to fetch Fengxian’s sacred garments—
Ma Fenggan, with subtle words.
Parted from Fengxian just two years,
Longing weighs like inverted suspension.

Gone without affinity, lacking travel funds.
Begging alms in Chang’an, self-reliant in coin.
Success rests with the assembly of worthies.

*Again*
Ma Shantong, Ma Shantong.
Unlike the Qiu Immortal’s harmony.
Heart’s bond has beginning and end.

Unite East and West, unite East and West.
Wise eyes perceive another merit.
Ever revealing inner content.

Rectify the household’s abundance, not contending for supremacy.
Fierce resolve turns to ashes—Wang Hai’s wind.
First return to the Three Isles’ peaks.

Ma Shantong, passing through Lintong.
Three topknots combed like a youth.
Dedicated to converting the like-minded.

*Again*

To Nanjing, to the Peng-Ying Isles,
Revealing Wang Feng’s ninefold perfection.
Transcendent, ascending on high.

What glory honors, what disgrace alarms?
The Three-Knot Mountain pities those bound to fame and gain.
Why fear the spirit’s dullness?

*For Little Zhang the Immortal*

Little Zhang the Immortal, Little Zhang the Immortal,
Gently seeking mercury and lead.
First must bind the horse and ape.

Qi unbroken, qi unbroken,
Dragon and tiger intertwine, jade pistil fresh.
A single golden elixir, round.

*For Ren the Immortal*

Left hand holding green, right leading yellow,
Once the heart stored flight and haste.
Now all things forgotten.

Drinking jade nectar, feasting in the Hall of Light,
Auspicious qi and propitious radiance enter the crimson chamber.
From nothingness, a jade scepter gained.

*Again*

Igniting the silver lamp, tiger and dragon descend,
At ease and carefree, absorbing the nine rivers.
Abandoning the foul fleshly frame.

Binding the red frost, hastening to Peng’s estate,
Ten thousand golden lotuses cluster ‘round the jeweled banner.
Only then is Peng’s fine Dao known.

*For Qiu the Perfected of Everlasting Spring*

Ever longing for the immortal, ever longing for the immortal,
Recalling Qiu the Perfected, most worthy.
When shall we meet in fullness?

Unfolding the flowered stationery, unfolding the flowered stationery,
Inscribing a few verses of pure chant.
Entrusted solely to the phoenix and crane.

*Again*

Merit must be complete, conduct must be complete.

Cultivating the child and mother within the body to perfection,
What worry remains that the nature will not be whole?
Rejoicing in wholeness, utterly whole,
Clouds and water, wind and moon—all perfectly round.
Undivided, day and night are whole.

*Again*

Meeting Chongyang, dreaming of Chunyang,
Igniting the incense of the heart to worship Zhengyang.
The Three Masters aid my yang.

Refining yin and yang, securing primordial yang,
Five-colored radiance clusters around the sun.
Amid the clouds, the Master embraces yang.

*Again*

Wine barely sobered, dreams just startled,
Why cling to illusions of profit and fame?
Ashen-hearted, far from worldly cares.

Moon newly bright, nature newly serene,
Reversing the flow of clear streams past Jade Capital.
The yellow sprout gradually flourishes.

*Again*

Households covet much, lands covet much,
Better to be ashen-hearted, weary of worldly affairs.
Exalting the true brings manifold blessings.

Heaven—what of it? Earth—what of it?
Wealth, honor, glory—what awaits?
The wheel of rebirth—what can it do to me?

*For Wei Haifeng*

Haifeng the Immortal, Haifeng the Immortal,
All matters forgotten, pondering the Great Mystery.
Harmonizing mercury and lead.

Binding golden lotuses, binding golden lotuses,
Ninefold refinement complete, the moon of nature whole.
Transcending the mortal to enter the grotto-heaven.

*For Master Quan of Lingkou*

A child of the household, dwelling in non-action,
Even unto death, as at the first emergence.
What worry that the Dao remains unknown?

Within—compassion; without—foolish simplicity,
Cutting off cares, forgetting schemes, free from delusion.
The elixir’s measure is within grasp.

*Again*

Dawn—so clear, so clear,
Dusk—so clear, so clear.

Stillness pure, leisure pure, stillness pure,
Pure—pure—ever purer.
Embracing the numinous, securing the numinous,
Numinous revealed, numinous luminous, numinous revealed,
Numinous—numinous—ever more numinous.

*Again*

Stacking the stupa, stacking the stupa,
Awakened to the floating life’s false body of evil.
Turn back to recognize the original beginning.

No hesitation, no hesitation,
Hasten to refine the priceless pearl.
Work complete, dwell on Penglai Isle.

*For the Many Female Daoists*

Female Daoists, listen, female Daoists, listen,
Learn from Ma Gu’s utmost purity and stillness,
Follow her wondrous and virtuous practice.

No pretence, no pretence,
Outwardly feign foolishness, inwardly remain numinous.
Work complete, ascend to the Jade Capital.

*For the Six Friends of the Sixth Bend: Du, Ding, Li, and Zhang*

Cease mourning others, cease mourning others,
Hasten to extinguish the heart’s sorrow for the self,
Turn back to weave good causes.

Seek the true early, seek the true early,
Nurture the spirit within the body’s inner spirit.
Work complete, pay homage to Master Dongbin.

*Gazing Toward Penglai (To the Tune of "Gazing Toward the River")*
Seventeen Poems
*First: Transforming Yao Xuan*

Breaking old paper, stitching a lined robe to ward off wind,
Sitting or lying, no fear of cold water-stone,
Daring to gather ophiopogon in the snow.
From this, obtain cistanche.

The dissolute youth,
Ever possesses natural copper.
Within the crucible, cinnabar refined to perfection,
The seed of celestial immortals enters the white clouds,
The cicada’s husk reveals Shan Tong.¹

*Again*

---
¹ *Shan Tong* (山侗): A reference to the Daoist adept Lu Dongbin in his reclusive aspect.

Ma Fengzi, alone savoring the Lantern Festival,
Trims the life-lamp bright as day,
Lets the moon of the heart shine through the azure sky,
Holds the sprouts of purple mushrooms in hand.

Golden youths dance,
Jade maidens play their flutes.
Though the wine of jade nectar is fine,
Some idle matters still hinder freedom—
Only regret the lack of true friends.

*Again*

Ma Fengzi, having met with the renunciation of glory,
Begs for scraps to sustain himself,
Living a life of true purity.
Refining white cinnabar.

Let none mock him—
His single-minded resolve is truly praiseworthy.
To hear the Great Dao at dawn and die content by dusk,
Pure as ice and jade, flawless,
He dares not disgrace his master’s house.

*Again*

Ma Fengzi, once lost in the ford of delusion,
Sought an exit but found no way,
Longing to know the true path up the mountain—
One must ask those who have come and gone.

The Immortal of the Wind arrives,
Speaking of good causes in earnest.
Pointing out a true shortcut,
Without error, he transcends the red dust.
Day and night, he feels his master’s grace.

*Again*

Ma Fengzi, suddenly recalling his time at home,
Enduring endless suffering in the fiery household,
Heart trembling, gall quaking, weeping in sorrow,
Regretting his late departure.

After wailing,
He gives thanks to his true master.

Reeling from the mundane cage to cultivate the Non-Dual,
Carefree and at ease, dwelling in the mystery’s subtlety.
By fate, one gazes upon the Jasper Pool.

Hearing the cicada—
Autumn cicadas clamor, their voices faint yet long.
Drinking dew and feeding on air, their song never wearies,
Each cry revealing the hidden and manifest.
This stirs in me a deep disquiet.

Alas!
In form, they resemble dung beetles,
Yet transcendently shed their shells like cicadas—
How can man bear to obscure the Three Lights?
Hasten to nurture the lead and frost.

The eighth day—
Tomorrow the ninth, today I visit Dragon Mountain.
Anticipating the chrysanthemums, I let my hat fall first,
Spared from Zheng Gu’s myriad lamentations.
Yet in the end, lasting long proves difficult.

Ma Fengzi,
Speaks of matters one by one:
The nature binds to Double Yang, its blossoms fragrant,
Unwithering for ten thousand years and a thousand ages.
Everlasting, joy abounds.

Ninth Day Chant
In celebration of the fine festival, all vie to admire the chrysanthemums.
They say Tao Qian deeply grasped its charm,
Meng Jia’s hat fell, his delight unbounded—
Yet in the end, all falls to emptiness and decay.

Ma Fengzi,
Knows another splendid scene:
Within yang, nurture yang—where yang is fostered,
The Wooden Ox leads to the pasture of the Ox.
Everlasting, Double Yang is celebrated.

Tenth Day Chant

This morning’s chrysanthemums,
People see them fading in intent.
Their autumn fragrance lingers but a night—
Enough to draw Zheng Gu’s myriad lamentations.
Yet in the end, lasting long proves difficult.

Ma Fengzi,
Speaks of matters one by one:
Ten thousand acres of white clouds know their place,
Golden lotus blossoms never allowed to wither.
Everlasting, the Daoist’s joy abounds.

Again
Seeking the Great Dao,
Not on distant, winding roads.
Amid cloud and water, at ease and truly free,
With the Mysterious Maiden and Infant as companions, roaming carefree.
Who can fathom this principle?

Ma Fengzi,
Has awakened fully to the lofty truth:
His two feet dance wildly in the streets,
Coming and going, only he is permitted to ride the whirlwind.
The bright moon is borne aloft on his staff.

Daoist Friends Build a Hermitage
Qiu and Ma,
Enter the Dao, forsaking all greed and seeking.
To repay their master’s kindness, they constantly bear it in mind,
Three years of mourning—how could it ever cease?
Where is a good place to hide one’s head?

The old dwelling site,
Deep gratitude to the fellow cultivator who permitted it.
Only wishing that my lord shares my aspiration,
With one heart and one virtue, we become one stream.
Together we seek Penglai.

Again
Outward inversion:
Love and desire like bitter enemies.
Wealth and honor, glory and splendor—all disregarded,
Where human attachments run deep, swiftly withdraw.
Beyond the material world, cultivate and uphold.

Inward inversion:
True fire plays with the clear stream.
In the sixth month, frost descends, hemp and wheat flourish,
In the three winters, timely rain nourishes the cinnabar mounds.
Cloud-borne steps seek Penglai.

To cultivate the Great Dao, why dwell in deep mountains?
Amid the mundane, blending light—all seen through,
Myriad worldly trivia leave no trace.
There is another realm, another state.

Ma Fengzi,
In leisure seeks more leisure still.
He sees a wooden ox roaring past,
Meets a stone maiden laughing, foolish and dull.
With a shout, he enters Chang’an.

Again
Ma Fengzi,
Karmic hindrance—stubborn and dull.
Fails to recognize the true offering of grotto-heavens,
But deludes himself with worldly rites, false completion.
How can his heart and mind be at ease?

Bound by external realms,
He desires to mold his master’s visage.
Building pagodas, halls, and erecting steles,
Heedless of the donor’s hardship in giving.
Sin and karma pile like mountains.

Again
Ma Fengzi,
Constructs three rooms for a hut.
Breaking ground, a year of labor,
Slaughtering ants—lives must be repaid.
Death leads to the gates of hell.

Mistake upon mistake,
Even regret comes too late.
The karma he forged must be endured,
Scaling mountains of knives and forests of swords.
How then to join the ranks of immortals?

Luo Gong climbs a tree beyond the walled garden to beg for verses
Ma Fengzi,
Fails to awaken, corrupts his practice.
Though secure within the walled garden,
Poetry and lyrics draw false renown,
Stirring unrest and unease.

Boasting cleverness,
Yet truly unwise.
Ashamed, his hidden self not concealed,
Wasting away, his hair turns white in vain.
How then to reach Penglai?

Spring day, a fellow cultivator in Hu County requests
The true message:
The pitch-pipe sets the spring’s arrival.
As the earth-ox is struck in season,
Where do the idle sprouts wander alone?
Who understands this principle?

Ma Fengzi,
Relies on steadfast cultivation.
Just when both ox and man vanish,
Limpid and still, he enters non-action.
This is the time of bright moonlight.

*Xijiangyue*, Thirty-Four Poems
**Self-Exhortation**

Seeing through the bitterness of family entanglements,
Joyfully leaping beyond the village gate.
In the beauty of Qin Chuan, I make my hermitage,
To dwell forever, forever, forever.

Beyond the material, carefree and at ease,
Now what need is there to send word home?
Returning, I would ascend to the immortal capital—
No, I will not go, not go, not go.

**To Fellow Cultivator Yun in Chang’an, Who Gifted a Daoist Robe**
Yesterday’s robe was tattered and worn,
Today I don this new attire.
If asked the reason why,
I show the kindness of a fellow cultivator’s gift.

Yet fearing its splendor,
I cast it aside, no doubt arising.
A Daoist’s straw cloak and bamboo hat suit best,
After poverty, sound sleep comes easily.

Again
Within the heart, constantly examine one’s faults,
From the mouth, never speak ill of others.

The world pursues, I practice non-action,
Begging for food in the streets without shame.
Daily I feast on jade petals,
Hourly I drink deeply of the elixir knife.
One day I’ll lead forth my transformed child—
Then the Daoist livelihood shall truly appear.

**To Wu Zhigang**
Leave behind wife and children to study the Dao,
Abandon qi, wealth, wine, and lust.
Let attachments and affections forever cease,
Cutting off all sorrow and anxiety.
Let no delusion briefly arise,
Roam carefree beyond the material world.
Constant purity, constant stillness—this is the work,
Fitting the gate of Perfect Realization.

**Again**
Studying the Dao, do not be misled by guiding and pulling,
Nor should you adorn your appearance.
Oppose worldly customs with non-action,
Your livelihood like water and clouds, untroubled.
How fortunate is the cultivation of merit and conduct,
Your actions slaying the Three Worms.
The spirit-moon of your singular soul crosses Jade Pool—
Only then will you know the ease of the extraordinary.

**To the Pure and Unattached One**
First, subdue the heart and extinguish intent,
Second, cut off thoughts and forget scheming.
Third, refrain from speaking of right and wrong,
Fourth, let no worldly passions briefly arise.
Fifth, perfect spirit and qi,
Sixth, uphold non-doing and non-action.
Seventh, let merit and conduct never falter,
Eighth, transcend the mundane and leave the world.

**To the Bright Moon Unattached One**
One strand of scripture, a jade-threaded flower,
Two wheels of sun and moon refine and boil.
Three carts transport into the cinnabar field,
Four seas traversed in cloud-wandering.
Five-colored rosy clouds appear,
The six senses transformed into blue lotuses.
The Seven Perfected gather, the nature round,
Eight-armed vajras subdue goodness.

**Again**
Master Chongyang of Earth’s Lung,
Lord Lü specially sent to wander the clouds.
Seeking hidden mysteries in secret depths, visiting Dongmou,
Hooking us, husband and wife.
Ten transformations, the pear-dividing craftsman’s hand,
A hundred mornings, the locked-door scheme.
A thousand poems and songs turn the head back,
Ten thousand kalpas share the immortal’s cup of wine.

**Again**
Unashamed of disheveled hair and grimy face,
Unbothered by coarse food and rough clothes.
Unabashed to beg as a poor child,
Unenvious of glory and wealth.
One day, merit complete and conduct fulfilled,
Heaven bestows immortal robes and majestic bearing.
Star-crown and moon-cape, stepping on clouds to return,
Jade pendants chiming with each measured step.

**Again**
People all cling to life and fear death,
I now recognize death to attain eternal life.
Few walk this path,
After awakening, boldly leave home.
Do not say the Mystery and Origin are hard to grasp—
I see them clearly and easily.
Bid you guard simplicity and shun excess skill,
Heaven and earth all return to purity and stillness.

**To the Tranquil and Unattached One, Ju Shouji**
No need to seek dragon or tiger,
Nor search for the maiden or infant.
Do not labor over discussions of mercury and lead,
All are empty names that delude you.
Only keep the heart pure and still,
Non-action is the accomplishment of merit.
Compassion aids in condensing qi and spirit—
Thus, the attainment of immortality is certain.

**Again**
The Great Dao comes down to six words:
Naturally pure, still, and non-active.
One who can follow this meets the subtle and tranquil,
What need for eyes and ears in seeing and hearing?
Within purity and stillness, joy arises,
Non-action’s merit completes the soaring spirit.
Naturally step on clouds to Jade Pool,
The immortal assembly of the Three Islands and Ten Continents.

**Again**
Speak not of departing dragon or blocking tiger,
Nor mention red marrow or yellow sprouts.
Do not discuss transporting the purple river chariot,
Nor speak of the infant, maiden, or crone.
Cutting off thoughts and forgetting scheming is finest,
Calming the spirit and nurturing vastness is best.
Non-doing, non-action—no path goes astray,
The enlightened root is priceless in its openness.

**Again**
Guard simplicity with patience,
Once allotted the refined qi of the Three Terraces.
Dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl come and go,
Bright moon and clear wind, carefree.
Fivefold rosy light covers and bears,
The spirit-pearl nurtured, departing the womb.
A single thunderclap, the cavern gate opens—
Only then does the mountain rustic find it strange.

**To Ren Shouyi**
First, do not slight the master or disdain the dharma,
Second, follow the pure and still immortal scriptures.
Third, preserve essence and qi to nourish the spirit,
Fourth, brush away all worldly toil.
Fifth, extinguish the karmic fire of ignorance,
Sixth, remove worldly rites and human sentiments.
Seventh, capture the monkey and horse to forever secure peace,
Eighth, taste the jade nectar’s flavor.

**Again**
By rivers and streams, snow enfolds,
Yin and yang’s workings wondrously rare.
Yellow sprouts, auspicious herbs emerge from the subtle,
A different kind of fragrance and beauty.
Gently grind with jade,
Refine with divine water, fitting.
After the mountain rustic sips, he ascends to Jade Pool,
Not conceding to Lu Tong in knowing the taste.

**Again**
Island hermits Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma,
For their masters, each abandoned glory.
Carefree and at ease, boundless joy,
No talk of high or low.
Unversed in zither, chess, calligraphy, or painting,
A bit of livelihood, no error.
Sleeping in clouds, lying under the moon, drinking rosy mist,
After drunkenness, clear and free.

**Again**
Far, far from right and wrong,
Cast off, cast off all dust and clutter.

**Again**

Let each person willingly untie every grievance,
Step by step through gentle shallows.
Goodness ever cherished, lingering on,
Mystery forever unbroken, endless.

Bright and clear, this perfect round,
Vast and deep, yet manifest.

**Again**

Every thing, each kind, recognized in truth,
Ever trembling, ever vigilant.
Heart and thought, ever fearful of sinking,
Gains and losses, ever diminishing.

Day by day, pure and still,
Moment by moment, limpid and serene.
Awake and free, this numinous spirit,
Radiant and luminous, eternal.

**Again**

Marvel not at the clamor of horses and wind,
Let human feelings remain harmonious.
Even in walking, dare to be composed,
Treading the earth, yet mindful of its pain.

No action, no striving—subtle efficacy,
Ever pure, ever still—true attainment.
In standing, walking, sitting, follow the Kingly Wind,
How dare the mind-monkey stir within?

**Admonition to Master Liu and His Wife**

To follow Xu, Pang, and the ancients,
Search your hearts and know this well:
With one heart, one virtue, cultivate the Dao,
The slightest discord leads to separation.

Three are not as good as two,
Two may still debate right and wrong.
Like solitary clouds or wild cranes, drift east or west,
How could the slightest thread entangle you?

**Again**

Though immortals are said to drink wine,
They do not drink mere dregs.
Naturally, the jade nectar’s flavor lingers,
Nourishing the yellow sprout to flourish.

Beneath the moon, before the wind, refreshed,
Raising a cup of jade blossoms, fragrant.
Drunk on the scriptures, sated with virtue, visit Penglai’s estate,
Reclining high in the immortal’s chamber.

**Again**

Studying the Dao, yet clinging to rank flesh,
Knowing well it severs compassion.
The five pungents tantalize the palate, fostering desire,
How compare to the essence of rice and wheat?

These two hold the subtle qi,
In our gate, vegetarian fare is fitting.
If cultivation’s merit and conduct falter,
How attain long life and enduring vision?

**Again**

Speak not of heart, liver, spleen, or lungs,
Seek not north or south, east or west.
Mention not Zhen, Dui, Kan, or Li,
There lies another profound mystery.

Drawing in the rivers Huai and Ji,
The stars, sun, and moon shine bright.
Spirit, qi, and blood flow to the elixir pool,
Then transcend the mortal world.

**Again**

Practice knows no time unfit,
Enlightenment brings no shame.
The first three threes and the latter three threes—
I dare not leak the celestial secret.

I guard my flawless jade nature,
Urge others to awaken like silver silkworms.
Best to retreat beyond the world, seek profound discourse,
Recognize that which neither increases nor decreases.

**For Guard-Purity Yao and Guard-Stillness Li**

To study the Dao, leave the fiery household,
Seek the mysterious, visit good affinities.
Guard purity, guard stillness, abandon all,
Beg for the great convenience within the body.

Clouds and water must clarify inner and outer,
Firmly restrain the willful horse and mind-monkey.
Unattached to the myriad conditions, spirit complete,
Fulfill the great vow of cultivation.

**For Master Awareness**

Sitting in mind surpasses seated meditation,
When the mind is ash, the mind-monkey vanishes.
The body like withered wood, naturally at peace,
Beyond the world, how could anything stain it?

Nurture qi without laboring breath,
Preserve spirit through withdrawal and replenishment.
Deep in the cloud chamber, eternally continuous,
A fetal immortal emerges.

**For Master Sun**

Study the Dao to perfect life and destiny,
Nurture the body, beg for what remains.
True merit, pure and still, verifies the primordial beginning,
True conduct relieves the suffering of others.

Beyond this, nothing to be done,
The heart like a wheel’s hub or a quail’s nest.
Carefree and at ease, seemingly foolish,
Yet passing the Three Clarities’ immortal trials.

**Attending Lord Hu’s Vegetarian Feast**

I prepare harmonious delicacies,
Naturally sweet upon the tongue.
No need for soy, vinegar, pepper, or salt,
Each taste more fragrant than the last.

Filled to the brim, not shallow,
That person, having eaten, grows renewed.
Hollow the heart, fill the belly, strengthen the root,
After satiation, wander the immortal’s courts.

**For Duan Zhi-Yi**

The Dao concealed, clad in plain cloth,
Heart kind, mouth far from rich flavors.
Carefree beyond the world, dwelling in a cloud hut,
Dare not repeat past actions.

Cleverness turns to dullness,
Awareness transforms to simplicity.
Master Duan, speak not of stinginess,
Vastly occupying clouds and mist like *Om*.

**Again**

Lying transformation surpasses seated transformation,
In cultivation, true constancy is prized.
The borrowed body cannot become fragrant incense,
Why cling to form at the hour of return?

The secret of ascending revealed in one move,
Immortality is but the spirit’s light.
The celestial palace has no use for foul flesh,
Carry it to the deep mountains to discard.

**Again**

I wish to speak only of purity,
Lest others waver on the Dao’s path.
Expounding the dragon and tiger’s departure and return,
The initial stage is full of strangeness.

Weary of discussing the infant and maiden,
Lest others misconstrue with wild guesses.
Who knows the man may birth an infant?
Turning back, one naturally understands.

**For Master Gu of Hidden Wisdom**

□Gu, the master in appearance,
□Within, no talk of "this" or "that."
□In the subtle workings of Ren,
□The Dao is his awakening.

□Also delighting in the mysterious gate,
□Soaring with jade hare and golden crow.
□Accompanying you to transform the foolish,
□□Intent like a fishing net’s count.

**For Cai Wu-Zhen**

□My pomegranates and chestnuts,
□Yet you must guess the golden core.
□In plain robes, leading a white-robed one,
□□Disregarding right and wrong.

□Learning unrelated to the great Dao,
□□Nurturing the primordial infant.
□At the Dragon Boat Festival, you emerge from the womb,
□□How could the seal bear the surname Cai?

**Phoenix Perched on a Wutong Tree (Two Poems)**

Fan Li and Zhang Liang, awakened in their day,
Gained favor yet feared, sought retreat’s path.
If one clings to fame’s treacherous peak,
How could they dwell in Penglai’s estate?

Someone asked why I left the capital,
The Immortal of Fengxian came from afar to guide.
Suddenly, the numinous brightness has a master,
From now on, enter the gate of eternal life.

**Again**

Beyond the world, carefree, cultivating the nine nines,
Admiring joy in poverty, stillness within nothingness.
Not visiting noble gates, ever inward-turned,
Escaping the three snares of heaven, earth, and man.

Sealing the Zi-Wu gates, true Mao-You,
White tiger, green dragon, facing the phoenix’s roars.
The infant on the Buddha’s face wears brocade,
Worthy to wander Penglai’s immortal paths.

**Moon of Pure Heart**

A single thought breaks the pure fast.

**Craving Love Brings Disaster**

Craving love must bring disaster.
Why should numinous brightness part from the Three Terraces?
Stealing peaches—not just two or three times—
Thus banished, cast out from Penglai.
How could this compare to pillar-and-beam timber?
Would immortal essence ever suffer dust’s burial?
In the Great Luo Heaven, all is well arranged.
When the golden elixir’s nine cycles complete their work,
Once more I shall return—
Spared the wheel of rebirth.

**Drinking Cinnabar (Two *Shāoxī Sā* Poems, Third of Three)**

A heart of frost and snow, free of striving,
Naturally untouched by worldly dust.
Ever graceful, sleeves like clouds dance between twin forests.

Nine-turned cinnabar births purple mists,
A stream of white jade nurtures yellow gold.
Only regret the mountain recluse finds too few kindred spirits.

**Again**

Beyond the world, cultivating a garden beyond the world,
Probing mysteries, seeking wonders, discerning the root-source.
Firmly seize the monkey-mind and horse-will.

First gather tiger and dragon into the crucible,
Then lead mercury and lead back to their origin.
Spirit congeals, qi knits, nature rounds into wholeness.

**Passing Hanpi, a Daoist Friend Asks for a Poem**

Had I not wandered the clouds to reach Meipi,
How would I know this place hides a Jade Pool?
Each one wonders why I leave no verse behind.

Walls adorned with pearls, steles carved with jade,
Their radiance gleams, resplendent with lingering light.
Why need Ma Yu compose another poem?

**For Venerable Zhao**

**Teaching in Myriad Ways**

A thousand teachings, ten thousand methods—all to instruct,
Yet how to teach you to sever the dust from your heart?
Only upon awakening may you grasp the true cause.

Fear of death severs the bonds of love and desire,
Forgetting scheming, qi and spirit naturally pure.
Non-action, clarity—thus harmonizing with Heaven’s truth.

**Sent to Daoist Friends in Nanjing**

Ashamed I lack the karmic tie to visit Daliang,
Nor do I harbor the intent to emulate the worthy.
Yet I ponder the Daoist friends at Yimen Gate.

I, within the encircling walls, temper water and fire,
When will you gentlemen transcend the heat and cold?
Mountain recluse urges: awaken from the yellow millet dream.

**Recalling Hu Zijin of Wuwei Hermitage**

Among cloud companions, Hu Zijin of Zhongtiao,
His golden waves and jadelike ripples cleanse the heart.
To this day, his cloud-water robes remain.

Now reading the wondrous record of Wuwei Hermitage,
Each word within shines upon my lapels.
How can these lapels bear such radiant splendor?

**For Immortal Physician Zhao**

With single-minded devotion, he enters the mysteries, renouncing fame and profit,
Free of worldly affairs, his qi and spirit clear.
The Three Lights gather—everlasting peace.

Unbound by the four seasons, he embodies true creation,
Five-hued mists of radiance coalesce into form.
A six-zhu robe hangs as the crane comes to welcome him.

**Again, Thinking of Hu Zijin**

How fine is Lecturer Hu of Zhongtiao,
A scholar versed in Dao, enlightened to Chan’s subtleties,
Naturally attaining such understanding!

The stone maiden returns drunk to the golden tiger’s cave,
The iron ox plows into the fire-dragon’s pool.
The fetal immortal plucks the purple magic mushroom.

Seventy years of light fly swift as arrows,
Half the night consumed—how grievous the sorrow.
How bear the daily onslaught of impermanence?

Then think of climbing the bed, shoes cast aside,
Pondering what beloved one to cling to.
Better to roam beyond things, wild as the wind.

**For Immortal Liu the Liberated**

I urge you: study well the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*,
Seek the immortal’s mold with diligence.
Profound and abstruse, the principle of serene quiescence.

Abiding in the true and constant, ever responding to phenomena,
Naturally desireless, also without mind—
Moving with sun and moon as kindred spirits.

**For Liu Chu Xuan**

The Dao nears perfection in non-action, non-striving,
No need to cast a line from the fisher’s rock.
Ever clear, ever still—a firm foundation.

Jade nectar flows, the heart free of cares,
Golden light irrigates, the nature forgets its schemes.
Chu Xuan, mastering the wondrous, unites the Three Mechanisms.

**For the Pure Wind Recluse and the Bright Moon Recluse**

Refining to the point of no-mind—this is true effort,
In the depths of the Jade Hall, playing with the pure wind.
Inverted, upside-down, coagulating crimson.

Ten thousand streams of icy springs dry the alchemical crucible,
A single wheel of bright moon emerges from Gui Peak.
The original face ascends to the immortal palace.

**Self-Reflection**

Once, my scheming heart ran wild,
Seizing others’ paths, I pressed ahead,
Thickets of thorns grew thick as forests.

Heedless of spirit’s wound, qi’s drain,
I craved jade heaped high, gold piled deep—
A walking corpse, bones for company.

Now, my heart moves with compassion,
Subtle mysteries draw near, profound.
Cloud-sleeved, I dance in jade groves.

In water, I seek fire upon the wood,
In fire, I nurture gold within the waves.
Cloud-kindred, rosy friends—my true companions.

**Presented to the Daoist Assembly**

Serene and simple, yet unwilling to cultivate,
Ever fretting over cold and hunger, flaunting skill—
Little knowing warmth and fullness breed desire.

Let pass the days in quiet solitude,
Shun worldly affairs, forsake fleeting glory.
Ever clear, ever still—the Great Elixir ripens.

**In Praise of Immortal Hao**

Fierce in resolve, steadfast in practice—Immortal Hao,
A lone cloud, a wild crane, most free and untrammeled.
Though my walls are humble, I aspire to his stature.

Daily I refine the heart, simmer the alchemical crucible,
Hourly I stoke the fire, mend the cinnabar field.
When merit is complete, together we ascend to Great Luo Heaven.

**For Old Master Zhang of the Mountain**

Cease envying silken curtains and crimson gauze,
Leaping from the red furnace, azure dust dissolves.
Within the mysterious, subtler mysteries await—only the destined may fathom them.

Inverting yin and yang, truly lucid and clear,
No division between bright day and limpid night.
A single wheel of intrinsic nature ascends to the cinnabar sky.

**For Nun Ma**

Jade Maiden, radiant immortal bearing a jade gourd,
Amid lotus fragrance, she plays with the whirlwind.
Within the Moon of the Western River, she gathers the sprouts of lingzhi.

Ninefold refinement complete—joy of boundless longevity,
Three Fields’ treasures congealed—unfettered and carefree.
She welcomes the Immortal’s Guest and ascends to the azure heavens.

**For Master Wang**

Seek not the mystery beyond mystery,
Daily but scrape away the heart’s human dross.
In tranquil leisure and joy, find true companionship.

Leave not a single thing within the numinous terrace,
Naturally the true gold crystallizes in water.
Then, with cloud-like steps, ascend the jade peak.

**Transforming the Sleeping Mat**

The mountain monk of Three-Knot Peak transforms the sleeping mat—
Noble ones, make no hardship of it.
Three strips of sturdy cloth suffice in width.

Each length must measure six feet,
Together forming eighteen—just right for the body’s repose.
No fear of scorching heat or bitter cold.

**For Master Yu the Tile-Pot**

Master Tile-Pot, in the world surnamed Yu,
Begging scraps across three thousand leagues,
At ease and untrammeled—worthy disciple of the Way.

Ever recognizing this as the true livelihood,
Naturally unbound by the world’s constraints.

**The Moon of Cultivated Nature Shines Upon the Water Flask**
*For Layman Zhao*

Pure, pure—utterly pure,
Clear, clear—profoundly clear.
Dark, dark—boundlessly dark,
Eternal, eternal—unshakably eternal,
Bright, bright—radiantly bright,
Numinous, numinous—manifestly numinous.

**For Master Wang, in Acrostic Verse**
*[Ability]* drives the three carts into the treasure vase,
*[Vase]* flowers blaze in the jade hall’s light.
*[Light]* shines, startling gods and spirits.
*[Startled]*, yin demons scatter, essence concealed,
*[Concealed]* within the cinnabar pellet, nature’s numinosity,
*[Numinous]* clarity emerges, surpassing all skill.

**Moon Over the Western Tower (To the Tune *Xiang Jian Huan*)**
*Two Poems Exhorting Daoist Friends*

Stroll idly, sit idly, sleep idly,
Nurture the cinnabar field.
Ever blend east and west, south and north in the crucible’s flame.
Dwell in mystery,
Ripples alight,
Withdraw and replenish.
Five-hued rosy clouds cradle a celestial embryo.

Again—
Ever pure, ever still, ever at ease,
Shed the dust of the mundane.
Freely roam, cloud and stream, seeking Dragon Mountain.
Nectar wine,
None yet present,
Nourishes the golden elixir.
Once refined, return at Double Yang to join the ranks of immortals.

**Joy of the Tossed Ball (To the Tune *Pao Qiu Le*)**
*For Yue the Awakened Daoist*

Passions forgotten, thoughts severed—light emerges,
Naturally manifesting a limpid scene.
Jade blossoms fill the tree, yet leave no shadow,
Within which, so fine,
Hangs the mirror of the heart.
Brilliant radiance discerns right from wrong,
This body,
In the end, returns to dust.
The original face, now purified,
Awaits, intent,
The jade lad’s summons.

**Night Voyage (To the Tune *Ye Xing Chuan*)**
Why fear heaven and earth’s dominion over secret mysteries?
Abiding in profound mechanism, thus poor and indolent.
Guard the encircling wall,
Lofty yet not short,
The horse-wind nature knows no cold or warmth.
Ever burn heart-incense, too weary to hold a scroll.
When will the debt to the master’s grace be repaid?
Once merit and conduct are complete,
Return to the Silver River,
Cloud-like steps hastening forward.

**New Chrysanthemums (To the Tune *Ju Hua Xin*)**
Deep in the azure grotto, true scenery hides.
Yellow and white flowers bloom—gold and jade distinct.
Ever auspicious clouds arise,
Sweet dew descends,
Augmenting fortune upon fortune.
Meng Jia’s hat falls, Tao Qian’s resolve—
Yet who knows where this gaze is fixed?
Daily celebrate Double Yang,
When merit is full,
The six-zhū robe is bestowed.

**Refining Cinnabar (To the Tune *Lang Tao Sha*)**
Heaven and water shape Cloud Hermitage,
Far surpassing a refined monastery.
Cloud companions, rosy friends—daily audience.
Just like planting pines to summon cranes,
How could this be greed?

If willing to awaken to pure discourse,
Surely sweet fragrance will come.
Fields and gardens entrusted to sons and heirs—
To dwell in Penglai or Yingzhou, first transform the self,
Lest one fall into dissipation and indulgence.

**Transformed Life (To the Tune *Shuang Yan Er*)**
With the Perfected One of Double Yang,
Joyfully parting from the eastern land.
Visiting the Lungs of the Earth, roaming freely,
Water and clouds at ease, without sorrow.
These attachments—let love and desire cease.
Guard the root-source, the two-tailed ox.
Circulate jade mercury, reverse the flow.
The golden elixir coalesces—no need for forced cultivation.
Expound the mysterious discourse, board the prajñā boat.

**Immortal by the River (Two Poems)**
Begging for scraps of the true living,
Without shame, without honor, without glory.
Surrendering the body—how could it be to feed hungry hawks?
Nor to be devoured by tigers, nor clinging to a false form.
Myriad dust-laden labors all set down,
Naturally spirit and qi become numinous.
Heart-monkey and mind-horse both stilled—
No affinity for the bitter sea,
But a share in beholding Penglai and Yingzhou.

**The Newly Departed from Chang’an**
This great Dao of Longxi,
Seemingly bound by worldly fetters.
Yet it reports to Tianshui, yearning for purity.
From Pengcheng, returning to true awakening,
Severing love to enter the gate later.
Moreover, there is Duan’s innate wisdom,
Awakening to skillfully transform folly.
Shan Tong, hearing this, attains completeness.
Joyful as if deeply drunk,
Recognizing the original thusness.

**To the Wine Steward of Fengxiang #4**
What Du Kang crafted,
What Wenjun of old ladled at the tavern.
Suddenly recalling Bi Zhuo of antiquity—
He once stole some.
Liu Ling, who loved it dearly.
Li Bai before the emperor, who once vomited it.
Le Ba, who rose in mercy to extinguish fire by spraying it.
The Duke of Sima, who constantly and earnestly warned of it.
Yet how could they know
The noble surname of this steward?

**Twelve *Nanke Zi* for Master Chen the Third**

In the world yet not of the world,
Dwelling in dust yet unstained by dust.
Like the lotus untouched by water’s cause—
Amid ten thousand blossoms, not a petal clings to the body.

Nurture the nature within the heart,
Cultivate the spirit within the body.
Each person’s awakening follows whom?
Old Pang’s whole household ascended—
Master Xu the Perfected did the same.

**[Disordered Dao]**
I have long renounced wine, meat, tea, and fruit.
Yet by your kindness, you bestowed pears and jujubes upon me,
And so, in gratitude, I composed this disordered verse.
Awakened to pears and jujubes,
Why crave wine or tea?
Now my life is cloud and water—
I urge you: leave home, leave home, leave home at once.

I find delight in sobriety,
While you still flee life and death.
Together we’ll refine cinnabar beyond the world,
And with ninefold transmutation, step by step through mist and clouds.

**Self-Admonition**
Eradicate thoughts of children,
Banish attachments to fields and gardens.
Gold, silver, wealth, wife, and kin—
Cast them all aside as if they were nothing.

Yet still entangled in worldly affairs,
Alas, how foolish the nature!
Better to abide in pure emptiness,
For non-action is the finest skill.

**For Fellow Daoists**
Sweep the mind-ground again and again,
Remove worldly passions bit by bit.
Let no pitfalls ensnare Vairocana—
Only in constant stillness and purity may the primordial be discussed.

Trim the wick of the nature-lamp,
Let Caoxi’s breath flow freely.
Let no coarse gasps disturb the breath—
Day and night, unbroken, is the true skill.

**For Ma Huaiyu**
When intent stirs, the heart must stir;
When the heart is cleared, intent is cleared.
In utter void and silence, silence returns to void—
Spirit and qi harmonize, mother and child dwell in peace.

Seek not the path of Caoxi,
Nor ask of the tailbone’s gate.
In true purity, true stillness, nurture true thusness—
True joy, true leisure, truly the finest skill.

**Again**
Why were you joyful yesterday?
Why so sorrowful today?

**Rejoicing and Sorrowing**

Rejoice when they turn toward the Dao, yearning for the subtle and serene;
Grieve when they cling to gaudy splendor, so unfit for the Way.
If you would seek the wondrous mystery,
You must become a beggar—
Unkempt, dust-streaked, rags hanging loose,
Yet with intent stilled and heart cleansed, this is the ladder to heaven.

**Seventh Night Lament**
In heaven, the first embers drift;
On earth, autumn arrives in haste.
The magpie bridge spans the Silver River, auspicious clouds afloat—
Where does the Weaver Girl call for her Oxherd this night?

Maidens leave their chambers, then return,
Yet sorrow stirs where none should be.
They burn incense, pray for skill without cease—
Would they but still their hearts and join the ranks of the immortals!

**Again**
In dreams I wandered the wilds,
A skeleton came to me.
Its voice was mournful, each cry more pained—
It rued the wine, the lust, the wrath, the wealth of its past.

Four poisons bring the body torment,
Yet men’s hearts never turn to ash.
Now it suffers through ten thousand kalpas of rebirth—
Too late, it regrets not having sought the Dao, not having become immortal stock.

**Again**
Wang and Ma met,
Their bond forged by past karma.
Taiyuan and Liang Park have already ascended to heaven—
Yet they recall the words left behind, to be passed on again.

Observe mourning for three years,
Hold fast to the heart for five more.
Guide others to goodness, perfect their deeds—
This is how Feng of Fufeng honors the immortal of the wind.

**Again**
Wish only for the Three Elixirs to coalesce,
Why fret over silvered temples?
Unwashed, disheveled, babbling on—
Yet in all twelve hours, diligently nurture the harmonious void.

No envy for Sima Xiangru’s ambition,
No desire to follow Ma Yuan’s path.
What was Feng’s intent in inscribing the pillar?
Not to cross the Ba River without becoming a divine immortal.

**Again**
Let not fame outstrip reality,
But keep reality as empty as the void.
Hide your mechanism, conceal your depth—feign foolishness,
Casually ask where the mind-king applies its skill.

Let your nature be the treasure of long life,
Your body the great crucible of medicine.
To refine the elixir, you must drink the purest ghee—
Drunk, lie upon the jade tower, toying with luminous pearls.

**Again**
No envy for those who awaken first,
Only sorrow that I remain unwise.

Disheveled and unwashed, the Purple Hut is everywhere—
This wandering hermitage finds rest wherever it may.
Unbound by worldly ties, ever free from entanglements,
Carefree and at ease, untouched by dust,
Yet the mountain rustic beyond the world knows not the work.

Meeting the true one,
Master Chongyang speaks of furnace and cauldron—
All lies in the field of the heart.
The mountain rustic too recognizes the original truth:
When nature stills and life abides, this is forever my spirit.

From now on, inner and outer reverse,
Gradually the Dao shines through.
Thus I compose these verses to exhort many—
Whoever grasps the beauty of spring flowers and autumn moon draws near.

*Cherishing the Yellow Blossom*
Matching the Master’s Rhyme
For Lord Fan of Chang’an

Renouncing wealth, abstaining from wine,
The medicine pouch tied at the elbow.
Ever serene, thus drawing forth tiger and dragon.
The heart stirs with great compassion,
Wishing to save all people.
Transforming ignorance—poems and lyrics like spells.

Avoid the snares of flowers and willows,
Hasten to cultivate divine radiance.
Within the jade flask,
A natural red dog.
Daily it barks at the azure sky—
Who knows it fits the mouth?
Further, when clouds part, it flies and runs.

**Lyrics to "Wu Meng Ling" (Forty-One Poems)**

*For Master Jing*
Beyond the mundane, Master Jing by name,
Ever vigilant o’er wine, lust, qi, and wealth.
Gradually perceiving his own bias,
No need for others—he corrects himself.

Self-correcting,
Self-admonishing,
He steps into the inner realm of long life.

*For the Recluse of Penglai*
Single-minded, pure, guarding the Dao,
Ten stages bloom with lingzhi grass.
A hundred deeds held in careful observance,
A thousand days refine the true treasure.

True treasure,
True treasure—
Through ten thousand kalpas, his radiance grows brighter.

*Again*
Do not marvel at my recent bamboo planting,
Not for love of its verdant hue.
Only cherishing its winter heart,
I naturally transcend the vulgar.

Transcending,
Transcending—
With a steadfast, serene will, he gains immortal blessings.

*For Master Yue, the Enlightened Recluse*
Master Yue, the Enlightened Recluse,
Grasps the secret, mysterious mechanism.
All day he strums the zither of the heart—
This is the immortal music of Penglai.

Immortal music,
Immortal music—
It resounds through the Hua Mountains of his body.

*Again*
Beyond the world, a grotto-heaven’s golden rain,
Watering the ninefold return’s count.
Ape and horse both still,
Thus nature abides and life endures.

Life endures,
Life endures—
A fetal immortal is born, soaring aloft.

*Again*
The youth of Three-Bun Mountain loves to laugh,
Preferring weakness to return to one laugh.
Not that I am thus,
But within, there is joyous laughter.

Joyous laughter,
Joyous laughter—
True joy arises in natural mirth.

*For Master Quan of Jingzhao*
Wives, concubines, children, and grandchildren—first illusion,
Gold, jade, pearls, and treasures—second illusion.
Third illusion: glory and splendor,
Fourth illusion: the illusory, colored body.

Knowing illusion,
Knowing illusion—
Piercing through, the fifth illusion: floating fame.

*Again*
First, escape the boundless fire of the household,
Second, escape the snares of fame and profit.

Third, avoid frequent reverence,
Thus fields divide in three segments.
Worthy of sight,
Worthy of sight—
Gold and jade congeal in radiant splendor.

*In Gratitude to Master*
Revered Master of Chongyang, Earth’s Heart,
You transformed my hundred-morning barred door.
Yet how repay your grace?
Three years of vows within these four walls.
Eating plain,
Eating plain—
Body draped in spirit-luminous paper cloth.

*Again*
The four—Tan, Ma, Qiu, Liu—all transcended,
Each in weakness, no distinction between.
Meeting parted in Dongmou,
Thus sought seclusion in West Qin.
Cultivating seclusion,
Cultivating seclusion—
Simply to perfect utter poverty.

*For Layman Fu*
This layman bears the surname Fu,
Unattached to glory, wealth, or nobility.
Beyond the world, he cultivates,
Entrusted with the wondrous in his nature.
Entrusted,
Entrusted—
Toward Peng Isle he shall advance.

*For Li the Enlightened Daoist*
Enlightened Daoist, surnamed Li,
She cast aside worldly ties and vulgar rites.
Resolute as any man,
She sought the mystery within the mystery.
Mystic principle,
Mystic principle—
Only within the Moon of West River.

*For Layman Ji*
Awakened to how brief life is,
She combed the lice and nits from her hair.
Delighting in the Dao, abiding in truth,
In all twelve hours, she refined the self.
Refining the self,
Refining the self—
To become the guiding thread of immortals.

*For Master Before Me*
Forlorn, my mist-and-cloud companion,
Firm in resolve, you bid me farewell.
Unmindful of my solitude,
Abiding alone in these bare walls.
Bare walls,
Bare walls—
All day, without feeling or thought.

*Again*
Intent on nurturing seclusion within walls,
Neither right nor wrong is spoken.
All day, feigning foolishness,
Teasing out the joy within.
Joy within,
Joy within—
Such is the living work of Mountain Youth.

*Again*
The horse stumbles, the ape raves—impure dream,
The tiger strides, the dragon coils—pure dream.
No action, no effort,
Nature abides, life endures—immortal dream.
Immortal dream,
Immortal dream—
Qi congeals, spirit coalesces, no dream remains.

*Again*
Jewel palace, golden gate, jade lock,
Seeking to search the drifting clouds.
A shadowless little key,
Turns the pivot and passes through.
Passes through,
Passes through—
Thus, neither ascent nor descent.

*For Layman Jia of Chang’an*
This layman bears the surname Jia,
Awakened to the body’s illusory nature.
Swiftly he turned toward truth,
Beyond the world, he perfected pure blessings.
Pure blessings,
Pure blessings—
Within, why need he hold the ritual goblet?

*For Song Zhirong*
Joy washes away affliction,
In clarity, no dust vexes.
True qi pervades the Three Fields,
Congealing into lapis lazuli and agate.
Agate,
Agate—
Thus, refining gold to mend the brain.

*For Elder Quan Zhiwei*
Elder Quan cast aside ten thousand entanglements,
The horse of intent, the ape of mind—stilled at once.
In profound silence and clarity,
The formless delights all who meet.
Delight,
Delight—
Nature like the clear wind and bright moon.

*For Master Liu*
Failing to greet its head upon arrival,
How could one follow its tail to see the end?

Gazing upward, ever higher it grows,
Delving deeper, more solid it becomes.
Solid,
Solid—
Awakened, each and every insight pierces through.

*For the Yuan Brothers*
Virtue flourishes in the Yuan brothers,
Adorned in moon-embroidered robes and star-crowned hats, their will fulfilled.
I urge them to further cultivate,
Refining the elixir furnace with matchless cinnabar.
Matchless,
Matchless—
Securing a place among Penglai’s immortals.

*Further*
A message for the Daoist priests of the Two Palaces:
In daily practice, sever worldly affairs.
Refine the furnace with white cinnabar,
Gazing inward at the inner realm.
Gazing,
Gazing—
At this moment, the Mountain Recluse attends.

*Further*
A message for the Daoist assembly of Zhongnan:
Early sow the seeds of good karma.
Preserve the qi and spirit,
Harmonizing the Black Tortoise and Red Phoenix.
Red Phoenix,
Red Phoenix—
Transmuting into a golden elixir, towering high.

*Further*
Now halt that person,
Lest they wander recklessly another step.
Abiding daily in true constancy,
Naturally, the divine pearl will be beheld.
Beheld,
Beheld—
Together as companions of eternal life.

*For the Recluse Xie*
This recluse bears the surname Xie,
Unattached to wealth, honor, or glory.
Fiercely he entered the Mystery Gate,
Restoring the grotto-heaven’s terraces and pavilions.
Terraces,
Terraces—
Where flowers bloom, never to fade.

*Further*
Wandering like clouds and water,
He surveyed the Eight Rivers of Qin.
Not like the rafters of a hall,
Where ten thousand vibrations stir the divine water.
Divine water,
Divine water—
This is the true water of the Mountain Recluse.

*Further*
Beyond the world, a thatched hut nestled among bamboo,
A single meal of cold porridge and leftover gruel.
Yet joy resides within,
Recalling the Wind Immortal’s admonitions.
Admonitions,
Admonitions—
Nurturing the candle of numinous clarity.

*For the Tranquil Recluse An*
To eradicate the source of illness,
Sever the threads of worldly entanglement.
From the heart, cast away sorrow,
Within nature, true joy and true bliss.
True bliss,
True bliss—
This is the immortal’s one move.

*Further*
Extinguish the karmic fire of ignorance,
Preserve the water and fire within the furnace.
Nurture the root source,
Essential to kindle fire within water.
Kindled fire,
Kindled fire—
This is the true fire of the Mountain Recluse.

*For Tan Jijiao of Jingzhao*
For now, be a swift messenger in the dust,
One day, your wish for leisure will be fulfilled.
Follow your lot and go with the flow,
Ever content in knowing sufficiency.
Sufficiency,
Sufficiency—
Seizing the three-legged golden crow.

*Five Watches to Layman Zhao*
**First Watch**
In solitary vigil, guard within,
The precious land plowed through with clouded toil.
Secretly sowing purple mushroom sprouts,
Naturally, the grotto-heaven is flawless.
Flawless,
Flawless—
Kan’s tiger and Li’s dragon in union.

**Second Watch**
In solitary vigil, guard within,
Clouds unfurl across the starry sky.
Sun and moon exchange their light,

Knock repeatedly at the Mystery Gate.
Awaken the person within,

Diligently guard against marauders.

Flawless,
Flawless—
A single point of numinous light coalesces.

**Fifth Watch**
In solitary vigil, guard within,
From profound stillness, nothing yields something.
Responding to things with true constancy,
Naturally, the divine elixir is flawless.
Flawless,
Flawless—
The embryo immortal appears, clear and elegant.

*Further Five Watches*
**First Watch**
Heaven and earth enter the grotto,
Grasping the formless to play.
Li and Kan naturally merge,
Limpid and still, dreamless.
Dreamless,
Dreamless—
My demonic army wails in grief.

**Second Watch**
In solitary clarity, wondrous function,
Upside down, observe the offerings.
Yellow sprouts grow everywhere,
Suddenly, within, there are no dreams.
Dreamless,
Dreamless—
Eight flavors of water flow through beams.

**Third Watch**
Deeply plant jade and gold,
Only then does the primal yang stir.
The elixir furnace births purple smoke,

The infant rides the phoenix,
The maiden joyfully holds the reins.
Nature and life both at rest,
Naturally, sleep is light, dreamless.
Dreamless,
Dreamless—
Auspicious qi and propitious light cluster.

**Fifth Watch**
Stars gather in homage,
Responding to things without effort to seize or release.
The night-shining pearl appears,
No sleep, no wakefulness, no dreams.
Dreamless,
Dreamless—
Five-colored clouds trail in succession.

*Lyrics to "Magnolia Flower"*
Following the Master’s Rhyme

**Gathering Daily**

Nobles gather idly day by day,
After meals, their eyes meet in silent gaze.
They fix their hopes on Ma and Feng’s words,
Daring not lightly disclose the profound mysteries.
Always guarding their qi and spirit,
Carefully harmonizing the Dragon and Tiger’s steps.
Slowly refining the Ninefold Returning Elixir,
Each ascends as an immortal beyond the clouds.

**Twelve Lyrics to "Ten Thousand Years Spring" (To the tune *Dian Jiang Chun*)**

**I. Why Cultivate?**
Why pursue cultivation?
The Wind Immortal’s hook draws forth a tower piercing the clouds.
The numinous sprout flourishes—
Revolving the True Mother,
Not the hand that stirs the broth.

**II. Who Has Not Erred?**
Small faults—who is without them?
A misplaced word calls for sealed lips.
Ranked behind the others,
How can one remain as before?
Only by drifting with the wind.

**III. One’s Own Garden**
In one’s own garden,
Day and night alike demand reconstruction.
The yellow sprout flourishes—
Longing to carry cloud-mother,
Yet where does one find idle hands?

**IV. The Formless**
The formless—each person,
Suddenly opens the golden mouth.
Discerning before and after,
One must cast off the old,
And grasp the primordial to depart.

**V. Lament for All**
Alas for all,
Wave upon wave, kalpa upon kalpa, chasing fame and profit.
When will it end?
Only when the light in their eyes falls to earth,
Do they awaken to regret.

**VI. Though You Have Children**
Though you have children and grandchildren,
Who can substitute in your stead?
Tears at parting from life—
What taste of home remains?
The thought alone shatters the heart.

**VII. I Urge You All**
I urge you all:
In the dust, do not vie for profit sharp as an awl.
Let your heart be first—
Do not deceive heaven and earth,
For regret comes too late.

**VIII. To Escape the Wheel**
To escape the wheel of rebirth,
Do not hope your children will substitute.
Do not shed tears—
The true flavor of the Daoist path
Is to first shatter the bonds of love.

---

**Dreaming of a White Brush**

Last night, the Mountain Recluse
Dreamed of wandering Peng Isle, meeting Zhong and Lü.
In the study, a few items—
A single pure white brush,
Not inferior to Meng Tian’s craft.
Far surpassing Jiang Yan,
Its five colors never tarnished.
In its fitting use,
It writes the heart’s awakening,
Worthy of the Three Clarities’ summons.

---

**Winter Solstice: Yang Revives**

At the winter solstice, yang revives,
Welcoming spring, the yellow sprout breaks through snow.
People marvel at its earliness—
Fragrant as lingzhi,
Jade-ground, finer than mortar and pestle.
Steeped in divine water,
It naturally dispels yin’s depletion.
The Golden Lad reports:
A treasure of unsurpassed rarity—
After sipping, one roams Peng Isle.

---

**To Chen Zhiming**

Chen of Earth’s Lung,
White hairs reveal his extraordinary distinction.
None compare—
A scion of seclusion’s lineage,
Who would bear the dust’s burdens?
Fiercely abandoning family ties,
He sought the mysteries beyond the world.
With a heart and mind purified,
He naturally irrigates
The Supreme Unity’s harmonious qi.

---

**To the Monk Repairing the Pagoda at Xingguo Temple**

A lofty monk beyond the world,
Serene and deep, a true Chan sanctuary.
A true Chan sanctuary—
Heart without clutter,
Principles ever searched and swept.
His jade nature crystal-clear,
Everywhere he is unobstructed.
Everywhere unobstructed,
Free from restraint or fetters,
He raises a golden pagoda.

---

**To Ning Jieyuan, Who Yielded His Hermitage Gate (Supervised by a Lyric)**

Tan, Ma, Qiu, Liu—
Each steadfastly dwells in his own hermitage.
In their practice,
They know not the gate’s form,
Yet there is one Master Xu.
Eagerly awaiting good tidings,
They hope for a glance of favor.
If not mistaken,
They will ascend the cloud path—
How dare they forget the grace of their patron?

---

**Exhorting Daoist Friends**

Departing, returning,
Returning, departing—when will it end?
Laughable indeed—
Entangled in profit and fame,
How many robes have they changed?
I urge you all:
Early preserve your primal yang.
Do not waste it—
Form it into a treasure,
And ascend to Penglai Isle.

---

**On Li’s Hermitage, Named "Tranquil Joy"**

Ever guarding the moving hermitage,
Ever pure, ever still, ever joyful.
Ever bearing the load,
Day by day enduring,
Naturally ever in harmony.
True joy, true delight,
Responding to things, the true constant remains.
Truly indestructible,
The true thusness shines—
Attaining the true noble rank.

---

**On Lord Li’s "Indolent Pavilion"**

A pavilion of indolence beyond the world,
Leisurely dwelling, at ease, acting without contrivance.
Acting without contrivance,
Naturally awaiting the pact,
Heart and kidneys intertwined.
The two qi form the body,
Congealing the numinous elixir.
The numinous elixir—
Silver radiance covers it,
As one unfurls cloud-riding feet.

**Thirteen Lyrics to "A Cloud Over Mount Wu"**

**I. To the Third Lay Practitioner**
Revolving the clear spirit’s realm,
Perfecting cultivation, illuminating the grotto-heaven.
On the nine-tiered terrace, auspicious mist gathers,
Seated upright in the Azure Radiance Pavilion.
Opening the jade forest’s elegant feast,
Delighting in the depths within.
The roaring golden tiger plays in waves,
Startling the mercury into a turtle.

**II.**
The Jade Maiden opens the golden hall,
The Metal Lord seals the jade pass.
Truly pure, truly still, nurturing the fetal immortal,
Clouds penetrate between Kan and Li.
Greedily gazing at the numinous light above and below,
Forgetting the *zhi*, *hu*, *ye*, *zhe*.
The spirit pearl emits ninefold radiance,
Riding a crane to the immortals’ abode.

**III.**
The Red Child feeds on the Green Mother,
The Scarlet Serpent devours the Black Tortoise.
Auspicious light and propitious qi may form robes,
Yet one must still hold fast.
Guiding and coaxing the Alchemical Girl and Infant at play,
Tightly sealing the Jade Pass.
A wheel of nature’s moon gleams in the clear night,
Cloud-stepping to visit the Three Maos.

**IV.**
Radiance’s friends, free from worldly cares,
Cloud’s companions, cut off from worldly affairs.
Qi and spirit conjoin in purity’s clarity,
Laughing as the Great Elixir forms.
Best to pluck the azure peach,
Offering it to Peng and Ying’s immortals.
Together we celebrate the Double Ninth,
Opening a feast to share.

**V.**
Do not call them master and uncle,
See them as brothers.
Refining the heart to patch the Jade Capital,
Why seek audience with dukes and ministers?
Strumming the heart’s zither to prolong life,
Drinking the medicinal dose, abstaining from wine.
On the jade terrace, jasper flowers bloom—
Together we tread the misty radiance.

**VI. To the Hu Brothers, Immortals**
Skilled at grasping the bronze sword,
Able to hold the white jade cup.
With hollow heart and solid belly, nurturing the jasper gem,
A single thunderclap from level ground.
Startling the Three Corpses and Six Bandits,
The golden lotus blooms in fire.
Naturally, a numinous youth appears—
Cloud-stepping through the Great Void.

**VII.**
Furnace-nurtured, the elixir of long life,
Garden-opened, unfading flowers.
To sate hunger, pluck the numinous sprout in turn,
To quench thirst, drink the flowing radiance.
Leisurely watching the jade toad’s glow,
Suddenly seeing the golden turtle leap.
Both play upon the azure lotus,
How could the phoenix calendar arrange the years?

**VIII.**
Drunk, reclining in the lapis lazuli canopy,
Leisurely gazing at the kingfisher curtain.
Naturally, worldly cares vanish without trace,
The treasure tripod’s jade flowers replenished.

**IX.**
Heart’s incense stirs with fiery devotion,
Drawing forth phoenix dance and qilin flight.
Dragon coils, tiger leaps—sporting the divine pearl,
Cinnabar congeals, hastening to the immortal capital.

**X.**
The yellow crane slumbers amid the pines,
The azure simurgh perches by the jade-green stream.
The white ox lies wearied upon purple lingzhi,
The vermilion phoenix roosts in Jasper Pool.
Only the numinous youth plays at will,
Wandering freely in wanton delight.
Through heaven and earth under the bright moon,
The perfect true work manifests.

**XI.**
Within the grotto, heaven and earth transform—
Serene, the gaze knows no end.
Tiger and dragon battle in the white clouds,
No trace of their coming or going remains.
The Maiden and Infant, restless,
Vie to bear Kunlun’s summit.
Jade and jasper shatter the spirit-embryo’s shell—
Mounting the crane, they depart for Penglai.

**XII.**
Jade thread pierces the three cavities,
Golden needle penetrates the nine barriers.
Naturally, the inner countenance appears,
Cloud sleeves lean upon the crimson balustrade.
Gazing upon the resplendent jade blossoms,
Suddenly a blue-robed servant calls—
A decree from the Purple Tenuity descends,
Summoning to Penglai, where the immortal register is already prepared.

**XIII.**
The candle of nature flames emerald,
The incense of the heart wafts purple smoke.
The lamp of life knots true jade flowers anew,
The eye of wisdom beholds the golden lotus.
This rustic charm of the mountain hermit
Stems from Master Fengxian.
One day, the ninefold cyclical elixir completes—
The Jade Emperor summons the immortal minister.

**XXI Lyrics to "Sumuzhe"**
In Chang’an, playing with iron horses,
A Daoist companion requests a song.

*Horse and wind,*
Awakening to the mystery’s principle.
Not toward eaves and beams,
Do you plan your household’s affairs.
What joy in following Fengxian?
Lightly swaying sleeves,
Shaking forth pure, beautiful sound.

Surpassing the swift steed,
Unfettered by bonds.
No love for silver saddles,
Spared the whip’s lash.
Suddenly, the tinkling chime’s melody arises—
At ease and carefree,
Straight into the azure vault.

**II.**
*Lively tunes,*
Neatly combed.
Wondrous skillful hands,
After enlightenment, display some art.
Each one comes unburdened,
Every one alert—
Even lice and nits must be few.

Zhang Dayou,
Li Gao the old—
Seeing my windblown madness,
Clap their hands and laugh aloud.
Who could fathom this mechanism?
Reversing age to youth,
Inside and out, all turned upside down.

**To Zhang Shandao**
The ears, a gate—
The heart, vexed and troubled.
Day by day, sorrow,
Unnoticed, the countenance ages.
The eyes, watching the gate, invite illness early.
The mouth, a gate of misfortune—
Virtue lost, the body perishes.

The nose, the mysterious gate,
Connects to the Great Dao.
In daily use, be diligent—
Gentle breath is best.
Transmitting through the nine palaces, it becomes the supreme treasure.
Long vision and long life,
Cloud-stepping to return to Penglai Isle.

**Returning to Laizhou, Then Back to Ninghai to Bid Farewell at the Graves**
This return—
For what reason?
Not for livelihood,
Nor for sons and daughters.
Not to boast of glory in five-brocade trousers.
Recalling toil and labor,
I specially bid farewell at the graves.

When pouring libations,
Open the earthly realm.
Nine generations ascend to heaven,
Together forming a fellowship of immortals.
Not that cultivation is hard to save—
Why offer three sacrificial beasts,
Or ten thousand rites of worship?

**Parting from Hometown**
Forsaking glory,
Donning tattered robes.
Nurturing the false to honor the true,
Tea and rice must still be sought.
Forgotten are former kin and acquaintances.
This parting from homeland,
Freely roaming at will.

Master of the self,
Must cherish and guard.
The Six Bandits and Three Corpses—
Wield the sword of wisdom, strike again and again.
Entice the numinous youth to leap and dance.
True joy, true leisure—
The Great Dao achieves the infinite.

**Exhortation to the Daoist Community of Chang’an**

In the bitter sea,
The Four Great Elements toil.
Vying for profit, contending for fame—
Each bears it with patience.
Yet they squander their primordial yang,
Leaving only the wheel of rebirth ahead.
What scheme can break its grasp?

Within the Daoist gate,
Transcend the Three Realms.
The Supreme One’s kerchief enfolds all—
Those who awaken wear it gladly.
Mind purified, heart cleansed, no hindrance remains.
Nurture the numinous root,
And life and nature endure forever.

**On Attending Funerals**

A subtle word,
Deeply worth speaking.
When the hare dies, the fox grieves—
The cry of kindred is mournful.
Do men rejoice at another’s passing?
When the great limit comes,
None are spared.

Turn your head,
Seek the secret formula.
Fiercely abandon worldly ties,
Still the monkey-mind again and again.
Refine the golden elixir, gather the white snow.
When the nine cycles are complete,
Eternally free from birth and death.

**Parting from One’s Children**

Stepping out of the mundane cage,
No bonds remain.
Fallen and dissolute, yet ever mindful—
Each day, contemplate impermanence.
Fourteen sons and grandsons, all cast aside.
Carefree and unbound,
Wind and moon are my companions.

With gourd on my back,
Iron staff in hand,
The flask holds nectar,
Within, the magic mushroom blooms.
Thirst quenched, hunger sated, lifespan lengthens.
Heaven aids the true wind—
A voice from Penglai calls.

**The Harm of Wind**

Meeting King Wind,
Wind transmits to me.
Wind howls fiercely,
Wind shatters worldly ties.
Tossing wind and whirlwind, fire and water entwined,
Wind’s child dances wildly,
Wind’s charm idly chanted in harmony.

Following the wind’s path,
Facing the wind, I sit.
After drinking the true wind,
I lie down on the pure wind’s pillow.
Spreading benevolent winds, merit grows vast.
I vow to uphold the wind,
Within the wind, karma is fulfilled.

**To Master Ma**

Ever fond of wandering,
Such is Ma Yu.
Fortunate to meet the Hua lineage—
At first sight, like kin.
From this day, bowing in kinship,
Grateful for your kindness,
All day, idly following.

Hear my words, brother,
Heed my counsel.
Do not fret for sons and grandsons—
They have their own fortunes.
Wish you’d swiftly still the heart, illumine the nature’s lamp.
Seize this tranquil ease,
Cultivate future blessings.

**To Magistrate Yan of Hu County for His Gift of Noodles**

Master Yan,
Kindly gave me noodles.
Personally playing the cook,
Skillful hands kneaded and softened.
Gently rolled into jade threads,
Placed in the pot,
Boiled in water and fire together.

Fragrance arises,
A fine meal is made.
Four equal portions,
Each without depth or shallowness.
To sate hunger, nine cycles are needed.
After eating, wander the clouds,
Everywhere practicing kindness.

**Wind Arises**

Harm-Wind Wang,
Uphold-Wind Ma.
Each follows their own wind,
All abandon worldly ties.
Chanting beneath the pure wind and bright moon,
Seeking wind within wind,
Discovering the elegance of true wind.

Following the wind’s path,
Playing with the wind,
Everywhere wind spreads,
Forming the priceless true wind.
Grasping the wind’s whirlwind, holding the jade goblet,
Galloping in wind’s grace,
Together riding wind and clouds.

**Self-Admonition**

Not stingy, not greedy,
Not deceitful, not cunning.

Not clinging to family ties,
Not speaking the tongue of home.
Unattached to worldly affairs, unentangled in falsehood.
No composing of poems, no daring to preach or convert.
Aspirations grow ever loftier,
The heart turns ever humbler.
Clouds and waters at leisure,
Within, nurturing the priceless inner elixir.
Joy abides in carefree play.
When asked of name and surname,
Weary, one answers: "Uphold-Wind Ma."

**Again**
Meeting wind immortals, the heart awakens.
No self, no other—
No love, no hatred, no jealousy.
All women and men share the same father and mother.
Disciples of the Three Teachings
Are all my masters.
Delighting in quietude, fond of song and dance.
By day begging for scraps,
By night lodging in the fields of sorrow.
Guard the upper, middle, and lower cinnabar with constant secrecy.
When the ninefold work is complete,
The cloud-path to Penglai Isle opens.

**Begging in Nanjing**
Through teahouses, into taverns,
Back alleys and main streets,
Daily wandering without cease.
Only to escape hunger and cold, still not avoided.
Passing days as fate allows,
Hands outstretched without weariness.
May all people
Hold kindness and goodness.
To give even a single coin
Is to practice kindness.
Do not mock the mountain rustic for his lack of discernment.
Within, nurturing the numinous clarity,
He possesses the proof of long life.

**To Brother Li, Who Again Considers Leaving Home**
Master Li,
Struggling to part from the mundane.
Gone, then returned,
Shattering the jade of Kun Mountain.
Spilled water cannot be gathered again, a broken string cannot be rejoined.
Nothing accomplished,
Only stirring up empty froth.
Regretting past wrongs,
Illuminating the candle of true nature.
Fire extinguished, smoke dispersed,
Let no poison linger in the heart.
Longing to join the carefree company of Wind and Ma,
Wait until the years deepen,
And see through to his innermost heart.

**Admonition to Brother Li**
A lamb’s skin,
A tiger’s essence.
Scheming to harm others,
Day and night without rest.
Though fierce, would you devour your own child?
Cease your bluster,
Temper your true nature.
Kin or not kin,
Acquaintance or stranger—
Clouds and waters at leisure,
Ever wandering within and without.
Three daily meals sought by begging.
When ignorance is utterly extinguished,
That is *pāramitā*.

**Begging in the Hometown Streets**
To sever family ties,
An axe must be used.
Split asunder the mountain of gratitude,
How could one consent to mend it again?
Fiercely extinguish the heart’s embers, seek the way out.
At ease and free,
Recognize a place of quietude.
Only when conditions align
Can awakening occur.
Change your garments,
The Daoist robe of nothing but hemp.
Do not be startled by begging in the hometown.
When ignorance is utterly extinguished,
You will step straight into the azure heavens.

**Matching the Master’s Rhyme**
The gate of purity,
The door of softness and weakness.

**The Household of Forbearance**
Forbearance as family tradition,
Simplicity as public trust.
No action, no striving—this is the path of life.
At ease and free,
Clouds and waters tread the way.
Cut off cleverness,
Emulate the dull and slow.
Steadfast and drifting,
No idle thoughts arise.
Face unwashed, hair unkempt, body like dust.
All things forgotten,
Fit to ascend the Three Pure Ones.

**Li Gongshi’s "Indolent Pavilion" Verse**
No combing the hair,
No washing the face.
Hunger within,
Yet eating wearies the heart.
No illness, yet idle sleep, the body too lazy to turn.
When guests arrive,
Breath still heavy with indolence.
No burning incense,
No chanting prayers.
Fallen and dissolute, indulging to fulfill this life’s vow.
Daily practice neglected—how can merit appear?
When the purple summons arrives,
The Great Dao’s non-action is revealed.

**Huaining Baron’s Gift of Shoes**
A clear elder’s cap,
The baron’s shoes.
Meeting Shan Tong,
A meaning most extraordinary.
It lets me stand head-to-tail with heaven and earth.
Gazing up and down,
No discord, no shame.
Gaining this cause,
Boundless joy.
Stepping out to welcome guests,
What fear of impropriety?
Delving deeper into its profound essence,
Up and down in harmonious flow,
Ready to ascend into the azure heavens.

**Eighteen "Auspicious Partridges"**
**Sent to the Daoist Assembly at Huaqing**
A wall encircles the cave’s celestial realm,
Auspicious qi and propitious light ever entwined.
The white deer cradled, ever at ease,
The green ox’s back, a place for idle rest.
Three years since I last visited Mount Li,
Nearly four since parting Hua Peak.
Cloud friends and mist companions must wonder at me—
How could they know this is where golden lotuses bloom?

**Admonishing Daoist Friends**
Though the pure and void are fine, clinging to family ties,
By what cause can one ascend to heaven?
Bearing the mountain of gratitude while discoursing on the Dao,
Dwelling in the sea of suffering yet clenching fists.
In the den of right and wrong, merit is hard to achieve;
Amid the thicket of fame and gain, how can fruit be perfected?
If you do not turn back to seek the way out,
How can you simply become an immortal?

**Dwelling in a Walled Hut**
Winter without fire, embracing primal yang,
Summer without clear springs, drinking jade nectar.
No wax candle burns—yet the candle of nature shines bright,
No aloeswood incense—yet the heart’s incense rises.
Three years barefoot, three years of vows,
One resolve for the azure heavens, one resolve enduring.
Guarding the mountain’s simplicity within these walled confines,
No debt to repay—why harm the Wind King?

**Passing Willow Ford**
Meeting Chongyang at Fengning in the sea,
Westward into the pass, unrestrained and wild.
Delighting in Plum Creek’s Willow Ford,
Joyfully roaming Bamboo Path and Apricot Blossom Hill.
Qin’s plains spread like brocade, fit for spring slumber,
Wei’s waters stretch like silk, striking the long day.
Endless sublime scenes, unending verses—
Command an artisan to paint them, rivaling a celestial realm.

**Ode to Tea**
Lu Tong’s seven bowls already ascend to heaven,
Brushing aside snow, yellow buds mock the sleeping immortal.
Though "banner and spear" are peerless,
They still rely on water and fire to forge a fine bond.
Rabbit-hair cups warm, golden buds unfurl,
Crab-eye froth churns, jade springs pour.
Yesterday’s cup dispelled lingering wine—
To this day, the spirit soars, unable to sleep.

**Living in the Hermitage**
Let idle visitors come—what harm?
Only fear idle talk of short and long.
True joy, true leisure—no debate,
Most subtle, most wondrous—beyond discussion.
If right and wrong are spoken, spirit and qi scatter;
At the first word of fame and gain, virtue is forgotten.
Better to still the heart in silence,
Naturally, both self and other find cool clarity.

**To Supervisor Han the Third**
A man’s resolve lies in his words,
Yet words that betray the heart bring only fleeting harm.
Though Han the Third is distant from Ma the Second,
How can Ma the Second forget Han the Third?
Nurturing a family is sweetness within bitterness,
Pursuing the Dao is bitterness within sweetness.
Sweet and bitter, bitter and sweet—awaken to this,
Leave the fiery household, dwell in the cloudy hermitage.

**Receiving a Letter from Home**
The letter arrives, hastily opened,
Just as I paste the window to block the wind.
My intent cannot follow yours,
The heart of the Dao differs from the worldly heart.
My practice is not yet complete for the great thousand,
Clouds and waters must wander to the Great One’s palace.
Tell my sons, grandsons, brothers, and nephews—
If another letter comes, cast it east of the wall.

**Again**
Heart’s incense kindled, singing the incense hymn,
True joy, true leisure—enduring delight.
Suddenly, the brows are free of profit’s shackles,
Why fear the body’s bonds of fame?
Once a pampered son of the household,
Now a man who has left his home.
At this point, ever at ease in the distance,
What matter the babble of words?

**Gifting Fellow Daoist Companions**
Where does cultivation require effort?
Swiftly sever the laggard horse and mad ape.
Firmly grasp, firmly seize—let the five colors arise,
Momentarily pause, momentarily stay—avoid the three paths.
A slight indulgence leaks the elixir of spirit,
A brief laxity withers the jade nature.
If wine, sex, anger, and wealth still linger in the heart,
Attaining the mysterious and wondrous is as if nothing.

**Again**
Though the Daoist lacks wealth, sex, and wine,
How to remove that single spark of ignorance?
When evil thoughts do not arise, return to purity,
When provoked, do not contend—realize the primordial.
Where self and others begin, sorrow knows no end,
When smoke and fire fade, joy remains.
To learn immortality, one must endure humiliation—
Do not let that true suchness burn away.

**Upon Hearing a Hometown Person Arrived—Words in Lieu of a Letter**
Cutting iron, severing steel—I do not think of home,
Forever ending doubt, forever abandoning home.
Feet treading white clouds, seeking feathered guests,
Staff bearing the bright moon, visiting immortals’ abodes.
The gardens and halls of home are not my dwelling,
Beyond the world, Penglai is my true home.
At ease and free, without lingering cares,
Why speak again of the old home?

**Again**
Everyone pursues the Dao, all toiling,
Each with lofty hearts, yet none with lofty aspirations.
Smoke and fire unremoved breed resentment and malice,
Worldly passions unsevered give rise to greed and gluttony.
To seek the mysterious and wondrous, dissolve the three karmas,
Fiercely strike at the root with a single blade.
Ever pure, ever clear, ever forbearing,
Non-action, non-striving—join the ranks of immortals.

**Again**
Once shackled by the yoke of profit and fame,
Delighting in the waves of the bitter sea while wearing its chains.
Children and grandchildren at home like jade shackles,
Wives and concubines before the eyes like golden fetters.
How did Ma Yu awaken from such delusion?
Meeting Fengxian, he cast off the yoke.
Seeking leisure within leisure, finding leisure’s delight—
Now, how could I willingly don those chains again?

**Again**
I urge you—do not ask of past causes,
Simply turn back, and it is your destined affinity.
Not pondering the floating life makes sudden awakening hard,
Slightly knowing the peril of emptiness brings you near the good cause.

To enter the Dao without intent requires no distinction,
To seek the Mystery with purpose is to have affinity.
Since ancient times, all immortals have departed the world—
How could one find good causes while dwelling at home?

**Again**
The Wind Immortal’s wind harms to reveal the true wind,
Leaving behind a family tradition to harm the wind.
The adept Qiu Xian of Tongmi succeeded him,
While Shantong and Ma Yu answered the call of Feng.

I urge you—do not dream within a dream,
Learn from me to seek the wind within the wind.
If asked the cause of wind, I plainly declare:
Cast off the worldly, embrace the wind of the heart.

**For Lord Li of Doumen**
No need to seek masters far and wide—
The immortal within is your true master.
Truly pure, truly clear, truly the ultimate principle,
Most subtle, most wondrous, the truest master.

If love and hate remain, the Dao is hard to seek;
With self and others still present, bowing to masters is in vain.
If your will cannot follow mine,
How can my heart be your heart’s master?

**Again**
The wonders of Qin Chuan are truly extraordinary,
Best of all is the treasure-hidden land of Zhongnan.
Bamboo paths and plum streams brim with vital essence,
Phoenix nests and dragon caves exhale auspicious light.

Cloud hermitages gather clouds in every place,
Many Daoist friends discourse on the Dao’s profundity.
The name of Liujiang Village has now changed—
Everyone speaks of the Village of Immortal Meetings.

**Four Poems on the Raft of Immortal Encounter**

**For the Pure Wind Recluse**
Diligently cultivating beyond the world,
Meticulously sweeping the heart within.
Gradually severing worldly ties,
Gently penetrating the Mystery’s depths.

The great elixir forms, numinous and bright,
The divine radiance shines, resplendent.
Fortunately meeting the raft of immortals,
Steadily returning to Penglai Isle.

**Matching the Master’s Rhyme**
The Three Lights firmly anchor the Lower Primordial,
The Six Perfections purify the Middle Realm.
The Nine Cycles’ Upper Primordial lamp
Illumines the moon of eternal life.

Unceasing brightness, day and night,
Radiance flows in an unbroken stream.
Revealing the embryo immortal,
Transcending life and death this time.

**For Master Yan**
Still the heart, cut off right and wrong,
Eradicate intent, remove self and others.
Free from wine, lust, anger, and wealth,
Escape the wheel of life and death.

Auspicious light weaves precious blossoms,
Mysterious dew forms pearl-like drops.
Naturally meeting the raft of immortals,
You may then ride the clouds.

**Again**
With fame achieved, it is good to still the heart,
With profit attained, one may turn back.
Monkey and horse no longer run wild,
Dragon and tiger unite in embrace.

Always keep the jade gate open,
Never let the golden pass leak.
When the Nine Cycles’ great elixir is complete,
Through ten thousand kalpas, the spirit remains clear and refined.

**Twelve Poems on the Hardship of Family Life**

**For Ning Bogong**
Family life is hardship, a pit of fire deep.
Myriad dusts bury one, unbearable to endure.
Meeting the Wind Immortal, seeking beyond the world,
Cultivation is good—refining yin and yang.

Pure and clear, one sees gold in water,
Radiant light shines, veiling the precious peak.

Family life is hardship, constantly busy.
Busy here, busy there, until impermanence arrives.
Becoming a yin prisoner, dwelling in the ghostly abode.

Cultivation is good, never busy,
Leisurely guarding the true constant.
With completion, the jade cavern awaits.

Family life is hardship, providing for others.
Clothed and fed, yet still complaining of poverty.
Scheming with cunning, losing one’s true nature.

Cultivation is good, living as a leisurely person,
Naturally caring for the Dao, not for poverty.
Refining the stubborn heart, nurturing the ultimate truth.

Family life is hardship, like a bee’s devotion.
Gathering flowers to make honey—for whom is it sweet?
If not cautious, caught in the spider’s web.

Cultivation is good, becoming a wind devotee.
The tongue produces jade-like nectar, sweet as ambrosia,
Nourishing the yellow sprout, free from entanglement.

Family life is hardship, especially greedy.
With wealth abundant, still craving high office.
Facing danger, no means of escape.

Cultivation is good, free from greed.
Hiding one’s light, concealing traces, fearing fame.
In non-action, escaping life and death.

Family life is hardship, clinging to worldly ties.
Plotting livelihoods, hoping for a thousand years.
Yet this mortal body is not long enduring.

Cultivation is good, forming good affinities.
With merit complete and conduct fulfilled, no need to count the years.
Becoming an immortal, for the will is steadfast.

Family life is hardship, without end or limit.
One day, the body dies, becoming a yin prisoner.
Facing King Yama, no freedom remains.

Cultivation is good, with a clear path.
With three thousand merits complete, one is no prisoner.
Becoming an immortal, attaining freedom.

Family life is hardship, delighting in opposition.
Constantly pondering the peril of life and death,
Fearing the past, encircled by the fire’s courtyard.

Cultivation is good, abiding in non-action.
The divine pearl’s radiance pierces the curtains,
Revealing the spirit child, majestic in appearance.

Family life is hardship, without respite.
Perilous and dangerous, like a game of encirclement.
Controlled by others, no prayers avail.

Cultivation is good, most rare and wondrous.
The maiden and infant vie to ride tiger and dragon,
Offering the embryo immortal, phoenix and qilin.

Family life is hardship, for wife and children,
Enduring right and wrong, glory and disgrace.
When the limit arrives, how can one bear it?

Cultivation is good, with a son in the south.
The divine elixir shines, abandoning the thatched hut,
Feasting in the Jasper Pool, virtue fully sated.

Cultivation is easy, severing ties is hard.
At first, understanding is most difficult.
Like impermanence, breaking through is arduous.

With the heart awakened, no doubts remain.
Realizing the past hardships of family life,
Learning to be an immortal—what difficulty is there?

Ponder the subtle and wondrous, reflect on worldly ties,
Searching both with precision.
Knowing emptiness, turn firmly to the Dao.

With a pure heart and intent penetrating the Mystery,
Naturally, one understands without words.
Attaining non-action, becoming a great immortal.

**Two Poems on the Command to Untie the Pendant**

**Matching the Ancient Rhyme**
Shantong awoke sharply,
Following the master’s teachings.
Realizing the past—all was not, not.
Correcting the root source,
Awaiting sun and moon to arrive together in the pot.
Penetrating the Mystery Pass, aligning with the principle of the Recluse.

Dragon’s roar and whistle, able to move and stop,
Cutting through delusion with the sharp blade of wisdom.
Refining the divine elixir,
Held in a golden plate, offered as a humble gift.
Presenting it to the Wind Immortal, delighting the original master.

**Again**
Subduing the strong, tempering the sharp,
Constantly examining one’s faults.
Abiding in the true constant, no need for seated meditation.
Before others, act small,
Without intent to act grand.
Within kan and li, tiger sleeps, dragon rests.

Neither hating nor loving, without self or others,
What worry of misfortune or calamity?
At ease and carefree,
Singing in harmony with cloud companions and rosy friends.
Claiming leisure—how many are there like us?

**Three Plum Blossom Songs**
*Presented to Master Bai*

**I.**
Escaping the dust, *Tuochenzi*,
Fleeing life and death.
Beyond the world, carefree as clouds and waters.
Awaken true compassion,
Awaken true compassion.
Silently nurturing true work,
Ever self-aware.
Luring the flood-dragons, summoning tigers and rhinos.
A lamp in water, its light enduring.
Cultivating lingzhi,
Cultivating lingzhi.
Bearing it to Penglai,
Wholly offering it to my master.

**II.**
*Presented to Fellow Disciples*
On the fifth day of the fifth month,
Dragon coils, tiger crouches.
Let not the horse and ape steal a glance.
Qi and spirit revive,
Qi and spirit revive.
The spirit-turtle at the sea’s bottom,
Obeying the breath through the nose.
The maiden and youth unite in clouds.
Longing to set forth on the road to Penglai.
Refining the rivers and lakes,
Refining the rivers and lakes.
Only when the golden elixir is formed,
Will you know the solitude of jade nature.

**III.**
*Presented to Elder Master Li*
How to discern,
Bewildered by false pretenses?
Clinging to family ties—when will it end?
Ensnared by the clamor,
Ensnared by the clamor.
Men of iron,
Melted in the furnace of fire.
Suddenly awakening—impermanence is no small matter.
Leaping from the mundane cage, seeking the subtle mystery.
Joyful and carefree,
Joyful and carefree.
Kan’s tiger, li’s dragon,
Descend into the jade gourd.

**Three Songs of Remembering Wang Sun**
*In Response to Perfected Lord Chongyang*

**I.**
With a pure heart, step by step entering the Mystery Gate,
With a still mind, gently nourishing the root.
Suddenly hearing the wordless discourse.
Nature unobscured,
A single spark of spirit-light enduring through ten thousand kalpas.

**II.**
Striding through Chang’an’s clouds, departing and returning,
A myriad golden lotuses blooming in fire.
Drinking the *daogui* surpasses muddy ale.
Two or three cups,
Washing away the mundane heart—what calamity remains?

**III.**
Hemp robe and paper jacket enduring winter’s cold,
Warm chambers and red stoves never glanced at.
Recognizing the correct principle, just so.
Qi and spirit at peace,
Forming the non-doing elixir of nine revolutions.

---

**Foolish Guo Lang**
*Presented to Perfected Lord Chongyang’s Nephew, Wang Zhouchen*

Cease your greedy pursuit of fame and profit,
Cease your attachment to wife and child.
Avoid the suffering of samsara’s wheel,
Become a foolish simpleton.
In purity, naturally enlightened to the Dao,
Spirit and qi naturally intermingle.
Upon achieving merit, ascend to the Jade Emperor,
Riding cloud-drawn chariots.

---

**Golden Plantain Leaf**
*Presented to Xu Anshen*

If you wish for spirit’s clarity and luminous purity,
Swiftly untie the knots within the heart.
Then do not endure the scorching flames of family ties,
Abandon wife, children, and property.
Displaying cleverness—why not embrace simplicity?
Guide the dragon and tiger, do not rush them.
Naturally awakening to the immortal’s wondrous formula,
The original truth never perishes.

---

**Green Jade Tablet**
*Presented to Dyer Master He*

The boundless fire-yard constantly enshrouds,
Like a drunken dream, hard to discern.
Flaunting cleverness is no playful jest.
Contending for wealth, vying in anger,
Clinging to wife and child—
In the end, what will you gain?
As if falling into the pit of impermanence,
Then urgently seek the subtle mystery.
Nurturing the spirit-root with true fire.
Limpid and profound,
Realizing the primordial origin,
The great elixir formed,
The celestial decree arrives.

---

**Two Regulated Jests**
*Matching the Master’s Rhyme, Presented to Lords Zhang and Ma*

**I.**
Jesting,
Discussing the subtle.
In the moon, the silver toad leaps on the fifth day.
At midnight, the golden rooster crows within the sun.
Kan’s tiger, li’s dragon encircle.
Suddenly encountering the maiden and youth’s summons,
Together guarding the elixir furnace, clear and complete.

**II.**
Steep mountains,
Illumined by rosy clouds.
A single spirit-pearl ever emitting radiance.
Endless auspicious qi perpetually enshrouding,
With more wispy propitious smoke curling.
The Three Pure Ones specially dispatch the Azure Lad,
Reporting that the work of non-doing is essential.

**[Ten Lyrics to "Magnolia Flower with Reduced Characters"]**
*Matching the Rhyme of the Four Immortals: Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma*

**I.**
Fortunate encounter with the Wind Immortal’s personal teaching—
Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma.
Parting Shandong,
Clouds and waters of Qin’s rivers stir boundless longing.

Poverty pure, joy untainted,
At ease and carefree, without artifice.
The gate of purity,
Expounding the family’s tradition to align with sacred scriptures.

**II.**
Immortal Qiu, master of mysteries,
Hiding traces by Pan Stream, unknown to all.
Immortal Liu, penetrating wonders,
Forever dwelling on Zhongnan, shedding myriad entanglements.

Immortal Tan, steadfast in rectitude,
Aspiring to poverty’s purity, cultivating great stillness.
The mountain rustic of Three-Knot Peak,
Wishing to dwell within enclosing walls, yet yielding to indolence.

**To Xu Yuanzhi**
Divine elder’s scion,
Bone and frame beyond mortal comparison.
Fiercely casting off worldly ties,
Beyond the mundane, seeking the mystery upon mystery.

Heaven enduring, earth eternal,
Walking jade, flying gold ever in hand.
Nurturing the yellow sprout,
Henceforth named "Azure Radiance" in Dao.

**To the Recluse of Mist and Rosy Clouds**
A banished immortal, suddenly awakened,
Wealth and honor cast aside without a glance.
Changing robes,
Daoist garb and cloud-wrapped sash trailing long.

Taming the ape, seizing the horse,
No longer parading fine appearances—maiden and youth conjoined.
Jade nature without dust,
Fittingly called "One Scattered Amid Mist and Rosy Clouds."

**III.**
Immortal Tan, master of rectitude,
Awakened to the ever-true, refining jade nature.
Ma Yu, the mountain rustic,
Vast and boundless, as if afflicted by the wind.

Immortal Liu, master of wonders,
Grasping the true of long life, perfectly clear.
Immortal Qiu, master of mysteries,
Cultivating perpetual spring in a land of unending day.

**IV.**
Abiding in uprightness, master of rectitude,
Daoist name "Ever-True," truly recognizing the highest.
At ease and carefree,
Smashing the gourd by the cliff to draw water.

Abiding in mystery, master of wonders,
Daoist name "Ever-Living," truly perfected.
Take care not to depart first,
But accompany Ever-Spring Qiu Chuji.

**V.**
Ma Yu, the mountain rustic,
Learning the Dao should cast off love and desire.
Yet entangled in poetry and verse,
How may merit be achieved to manifest the Purple Tenuity?

How to awaken fiercely?
Within these lyrics to "Magnolia Flower" it is told.
A hundred bows to the poetry demon—
No longer as before, reversed and confused.

**VI.**
Poetry and verse as transgression,
Obstructing my leisurely immortal vocation.
Suddenly awakened, heart startled,
As if treading thin ice over a deep abyss.

Then setting aside brush and ink,
Instead cherishing qi and spirit in mutual embrace.
Indolent and idle,
Non-action, non-doing—this is Ma’s Way.

**Farewell to Nanjing (Character Dissection)**
□ today I take leave,
□ dwelling at ease in Golden King’s abode.
□ the gate opens,
□ within, no one returns again.

□ gold refined into treasure,
□ the infant’s veins grasp agate and cornelian.
□ with the mountain rustic,
□ departing for Penglai and Yingzhou to pay homage to Lord Lü.

**Passing through Jingyuan Town**
□ soldiers humiliated me,
□ amid the forest of halberds, who could resolve the calamity?
□ eloquence sharp as a blade,
□ wood and earth harmonized—this is Lord Xia.

□ now purified and liberated,
□ hare and crow of the sun live together.
□ incense burning below,
□ the grateful one sounds the fish-drum and zhang.

**Hanging Golden Lamp**
*To Master Chongyang’s Nephew, Wang Zhouchen*

Severing all attachments,
Light born within the heart, lustrous and bright.
Suddenly transformed,
Endless wondrous scenes.

This esoteric marvel—teach the worthy to reflect.
The inner visage must swiftly be ordered;
After awakening, the division of mortal and sage.
From the primal, numinous clarity,
Within the fire, the true force burns strong.
Through tempering and refining,
Emerges purity within stillness.

**Dripping Gold**
*For Master Cai*

A wanderer at ease in water and cloud,
Wood and metal conjoined, no longer sundered.
From this, Infant and Maiden recognize their knowledge—
Behold the color within the formless.
Tiger and dragon battle beside Caoxi’s stream;
Within the tripod and furnace, refine the yellow and white.
Who has tasted the great elixir’s completion?
Master Cai alone is worthy.

**Virtue Repays Resentment (Zhaojun’s Grievance)**
*For Wu Zhigang*

Impetuous nature now becomes patient,
Intent stilled, the heart naturally stills.
Hatred and love both forgotten,
All heat and cold severed.
Tiger withdrawn, dragon coiled—light gleams;
The elixir congeals, jade lads invite.
Sleeves dance forth from Kunlun’s ridge,
Bound for Peng’s estate.

**Golden Rooster Crows Ten Heads**
*Transforming Li Zhongda*

Hooking the leviathan demands bait,
Cast fragrant lure, ever tuning the line.
Vast and unbound, heedless of the deceptive waves.
No need to flee—
I’ll bind you fast as glue.

The golden hook cast, ever stirring,
If he turns his head, lead him to the mystery.
Thus shall he surely become immortal.
Pay homage to the Three Pure Ones—
All arises from my golden rooster’s crow.

**Again**

Day after day, ever heralding dawn,
Who knows that all err?

Relentless in greed, deceitful and false,
Nature and life both forgotten—
Wealth and lust breed cunning.
Evil karma boundless, hidden virtue scant,
What awaits is no small matter.

When the appointed hour arrives, Fengdu summons,
Ghostly messengers seize you in wrath—
Yet still you heed not my golden rooster’s crow.

**Again**

Day after day, ever heralding dawn,
Yet men remain heedless, searching for mystery.
Diligently cultivate goodness, turn the light inward.
See through this fleeting life,
Then cast aside worldly ties.

The nine-curved bright pearl fits its nine apertures,
Threaded like ants drawn to flame—
Pierce through, and the work is done.
Bound for Penglai’s isles,
All arises from my golden rooster’s crow.

**Again**

Within the fiery household, flames ever burn,
Anxious for children, your visage withers.
Others fret for you in vain.
I offer poems and verses,
Hoping your heart awakens.

The unforeseen impermanence is no small thing—
Awaken, then seek the mystery.
The clouded path to Penglai holds the crucial pass.
Refine the golden elixir,
All arises from my golden rooster’s crow.

**Again**

Outward cleverness is no true grace,
Inward cultivation—even a little—is most wondrous.
True Suchness, a single gleam of the Three Lights.
Kindle the incense of the heart,
Auspicious mist will gather.

If the wise man Li Si awakens,
From nothingness arises something—
Profound and boundless.
The fetal immortal dances, sleeves swaying with radiant light.
Mounting the crane, soaring into the void,
All arises from my golden rooster’s crow.

**Again**

You are by nature an immortal—why not awaken?
Heed my counsel: worldly ties are small.
Leap from the bitter sea of delusion.
A single spark of spirit,
Yet trapped by dust’s snare.

Beyond the world, still the heart to fathom the mystery,
Ever pure—
Dragon coiled, tiger withdrawn.
The divine elixir congeals, radiance ascends.
Reverse aging, restore youth,
All arises from my golden rooster’s cry.

**Again**

As dusk’s fading light dims, why not awaken?
Gather your heart, turn the light inward.
Swiftly seek the mystery,
Hasten in cultivation—
Lest the sun sink beyond reach.

Cultivating immortality beyond the world is no pretense,
Recognize early the hook in words, the bait in speech.
Swallow a little of the poetic lure,
Leap from the sea of delusion,
And grasp my golden rooster’s cry.

**Again**

Having been granted entry to the Dao,
The fire pit runs deep—best leap boldly.
A man’s word should hold no falsehood.
Take care not to hesitate,
Lest others mock you.

Sever worldly ties, return swiftly,
Unlike the crane leaving words on the stele.
From here, Ma Yu ascends to gaze afar.
I urge you, my brother,
Never forget my golden rooster’s cry.

**Again**

The mountain rustic of Sanji laughs heedlessly,
Leaving home and hearth, needlessly courting sorrow.
Anxious for others’ lives, he forgets his own path.
All day lamenting for others,
Yet neglecting his own Dao.

One might cast a hook and seek the catch,
But first, endure the trials of fire and strife.
Bear shame, endure disgrace, and warn again and again.
I urge you, good sir,
Awaken early to my golden rooster’s cry.

**Again**

When I was permitted to enter the Dao,
I thought you, sir, held no deceit.
I urged you to cast aside worldly ties early.
A slight delay,
And you compose melodies of the many palaces.

If you but turn your head, how fine it would be—
Joyful and carefree, holding a cup in laughter.
Beneath the moon, plucking the lute, incense curls.
Searching for the mystery,
You’ll find another golden rooster’s cry.

---

**Subtle Wonders #2**
*For Steward Pang and Magistrate Zhao*

A trifling wonder, most extraordinary—
Within the raging flames,
Mushrooms of immortality grow naturally.
Jade tiger and golden dragon
Guard the Three Fields’ treasure in secret.

The elixir refined through nine cycles, the Azure Lad reports,
Then receives the Purple Tenuity’s decree.
Clad in the six-zhu robe,
Mounting the crane, he returns to Penglai’s isle.

---

**Dao Attained, Returning #3** *(Two Poems, to the tune of "Ruan Lang Gui")*

*Dao Attained, Returning*
The cultivator rejoices in knowing.
Within the pine peak’s shadow, delighting in stillness,
Why sing wanton verses?

The maiden stirs, tiger and dragon follow,
Plowing clouds through Kan and Li.
Three thousand merits fulfilled, bound for Jasper Pool,
His divine radiance and form wondrous.

---

**For Scholar Yue (Hidden Head Poem)**

□ Years of bitter resolve, seeking no marvel,
□ Few find the seeker.
□ Swift awakening, a faint smile,
□ Splendor vainly schemed.

□ The master reclines,
□ The maiden flourishes,
□ Auspicious clouds encircle the palace.
□ The mind-seal transmitted, faithfully upheld,
□ The spirit soars freely.

---

**Welcoming the Immortal**

Sun’s crow, moon’s hare,
Racing through Zi and Wu—never resting.
Tiger follows dragon, dragon follows tiger,
East and west they traverse,
Ever the luminous path of jade.

The maiden sings, the infant dances,
Within the jade hall, gold presides.
Clouds as companions, rosy hues as lovers,
Carefree and at ease,
Opening the gate of Perfect Truth.

---

**Cloud-Girdled Waist (Girdled Skirt’s Waist)**

On Kunyu’s peak, Master Danyang,
Truly blessed, met the Wind Immortal.
This life fulfills a past vow,
Visiting Qin’s riverlands, dwelling at Earth’s heart,
Forge a bond most true.

Li pure, Kan still—water births fire,
Infant and maiden slumber,
Tiger and dragon sleep.
Spirit congealed, qi gathered, divine light appears,
Mounting the cloud chariot,
Piercing the auspicious mist,
To ascend and pay homage to the Origin.

---

**Ascending the Gate of Immortality** *(Two Poems)*

Master, ah Master,
Master Chongyang!
Abiding in the mystery,
In stillness, pure.

Raising the golden lotus, the jade flower community—
Who knows this?
Transforming all,
Gradually returning to the Dao.

This Fengxiang—
Not enlightenment, nor folly.
Discerning false from true,
Slightly enlightened.

Ponder deeply,
Heart opened, doubts dispelled.
Recalling the master’s example—
None surpass him.

**Again**

Hard, ah hard!
Leaving home is hard!

Sever love and hate—
hard to cast off the dust.

Abiding in non-action, in purity and stillness—
hard from start to end.

Like death itself—
what could be harder?

Discoursing on the Mysterious Origin,
expounding subtleties—
all to be heard by others.

Yet if a young novice
comes forth to inquire,
then one must open the path of words,
guide them forward.

I cannot
ensure their journey ahead.
