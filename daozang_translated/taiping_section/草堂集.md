**The Thatched Hut Collection**
By Master Wang of Five Peaks and White Clouds

**Lyrics: Eleven "Court Full of Fragrance"**

Composed on the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month, the anniversary of the descent of the Venerable Ancestor Chongyang, the Wondrous-Act Realized Man of Compassionate Transformation, and the ascension of Master Danyang, the Merciful-Wish Realized Man, into the rosy clouds. After the assembly of Daoist companions completed the purification feast, these lyrics were presented as a gift.

---

**Snow clears o’er fields and gardens,**
**Ice congeals on ponds and pools—**
**The time has come to delve into the depths of winter.**
On this day, Chongyang descended,
Revealing the true wind of the Dao.
Once more, Master Danyang,
Leaving the dusty world behind,
Soared to the celestial palace.
In the principle of the Mysterious Origin,
One ascends, one descends—
Manifesting the utmost divine power.

**Boundless—**
**The hands of the true master,**
From the capital’s south to Shaanxi’s west,
From Hebei to Shandong.
From children to the aged,
Who does not revere and honor?
Responding to things, adapting to circumstances,
Bestowing expedient means,
The Three Teachings harmonize as one.
All you gentlemen,
From this day forward,
When shall we meet again?

---

**To Wei Dechun**

The shackles of profit, the fetters of fame,
The ropes of affection, the cords of desire—
Who is not ensnared?
Yet if one can awaken,
It is but the fruition of prior causes.
How much worse to seek liberation in anguish,
Probing emotions only to turn them into enmity!
Do you not know?
In the unseen, true sages
Will guide you to grasp the Celestial Origin.

**Be steadfast,**
**Be vigilant—**
Rein in the mind-horse,
Capture the heart-ape.
Even a slight indulgence
Will damage the field of mushrooms.
In daily life, constantly examine your faults,
Among the multitude,
Never notice the transgressions of others.
Act thus,
And the original single point
Shall not lack perfection.

---

**To Liu Silang**

A family of cold simplicity,
A household of quiet leisure—
Who takes the trouble to seek it out?
The primal numinous awareness,
Imprisoned in the burning house.
Clinging to fleeting affections,
Never realizing the journey ahead has an end.
Awaken now!
Follow our kind,
Sever ten thousand entanglements at once.

**Carefree—**
What can compare?
The hawk freed from its cage,
The fish slipped from the hook.
Truly, drifting like a lone boat,
Cast off from its moorings.
Eat when hungry, drink when thirsty,
When sated, drum your belly and sing.
Unfettered,
When merit is complete, depart,
Striding high to visit Penglai.

---

**To Zhou Xin and Others**

Nobility and baseness are ordained by Heaven,
Flourishing and withering follow one’s lot—
Clearly, they do not lie in forced scheming.
What is gained was originally possessed,
What is lost was never truly there.
In vain, one employs cunning and luck,
Exhausting spirit and wit,
Wearing out the body.
Foolish and deluded souls,
Chasing the path of petty profit—
What do they gain from their greed?

**Moon and crow,**
**Hastening in flight—**
Within the span of a hundred years,
Light and shadow pass in an instant.
Once, rosy cheeks and raven locks
Turn entirely to frost and snow.
Soon, impermanence will arrive—
What will you rely on then?
How can you compare to me,
Empty, idle, and still,
Preserving the great elixir furnace?

---

**Again**

A single point of numinous clarity,
Ten thousand emotions tugging at the threads—
When has it ever known a moment’s peace?
The wheel of rebirth presses urgently,
Trading bones like mountains.
Thus, the deluded heart remains unenlightened,
Boasting of cleverness, galloping in cunning.
It is no different
From the moth flying into the flame,
The ant endlessly circling.

**This time,**
**Having personally encountered**
The descent of the host of immortals into the world,
Expounding and transforming among humankind,
They revealed the Great Teaching of Perfect Truth,
Pointing directly to the Mysterious Pass.
Abide always in constant purity, constant stillness,
Cease debating the reversal of aging and the return to youth.
From now on,
Dispel doubts, sever delusions,
And your name shall be listed among the ranks of immortals.

---

**Again**

The four karmic deeds, the three Peng spirits,
The seven emotions, the six desires—
Day and night, they incite and provoke.
Trapped in their cycles,
One cannot escape the black winds and waves.
Exhausting stinginess, greed, jealousy,
Cunning and deceit,
Endless snares are set.
Alas!
From ancient times to the present,
Who has not suffered their scorn?

**Brother Wang—**
**I have revealed the truth to you—**
You must be resolute and decisive,
Beware of wasting time.
Wield the sword of dispassionate wisdom,
Sharpen it again and again.
Even if you face the battlefield,
Strengthen your resolve,
Scatter the hordes of demons.
Upon your return,
The people will be at peace, the nation prosperous,
And all shall sing the song of Great Peace.

---

**On the Three Teachings**

Buddhism expounds emptiness and stillness,
Daoism discourses on purity and quietude,
Confucianism perfects the hundred virtues.
The three branches stand,
Mutually elucidating good affinities.
The Master, Confucius, is renowned as the Ultimate Sage,
The Tathāgata realized the Great Awakening as the Golden Immortal.
Our school’s patriarch,
Laozi, bears the august title—
Transmitted from ancient times to the present.

**Profound, profound—**
**Of one body,**
Who is high, who is low?
Who comes after, who comes first?
Together, they support the state,
Universally transforming humans and heavens.
Like the vast ocean,
Diverging into streams,
Flowing through all rivers.
Yet in the end,
Wherever they wander,
They all return to the source.

---

**In Reply to One Asking Why I Left Home and How to Cultivate the Dao**

Idle words scribbled,
Crude verses composed,
I roughly set forth my humble insights.
Ensnared in the dream of the world,
I idly passed twenty springs.
Suddenly awakening to the perilous road ahead,
Dragging along affections—
Who would dare to procrastinate?
I joined the Mystery Teaching,
Exploring its profound and wondrous secrets,
Freely delighting in the celestial truth.

**Embracing poverty—**
What a fine livelihood!
Returning to simplicity, nurturing purity,
Cultivating the spirit.
Fortunate to have the clear wind as companion,
The bright moon as neighbor.
I have claimed a life of leisure and freedom,
Following the sun and moon
As they rise in the east and set in the west.
In the realm beyond words,
A hint of the message—
How many can truly hear it?

---

**Instructions to the Assembly**

Fine sesame oil,
Double-sifted white flour,
Rice pounded and washed like ivory.
Meticulously prepared offerings,
A feast of rare delicacies arrayed.
Reverently performing the incense ritual, entering stillness,
Bowing repeatedly—
How could one shrink from toil?
We only hope that
The living may obtain blessings,
The deceased may ascend and transcend.

**All of you—**
Heed the exhortation:
Do not grow lax,
Hold fast to the Dao in unwavering devotion.
In clarity of mind and purification of thought,
Do not violate the celestial precepts.
Even the slightest breach of the fast or transgression of the precepts,
Without shame or remorse—
Not even a drop of water can atone.
Deficient in merit and conduct,
When the final reckoning comes,
Heaven and Earth will not lightly forgive.

---

**Lyrics Composed at the Command of Marshal Wanyan of Pingzhou for a Ritual Feast**

**Harmonious qi flows in warmth,**
the sun lingers, the breeze softens—
a radiant day where all things align.
Gardens and groves embroidered in splendor,
peach and plum in full bloom.
Swallows chatter, orioles vie in song,
golden-green willow fronds droop low.
A delicate fragrance drifts—
on this day, a celestial presence
bestows its auspicious grace upon the inner chambers.

**Divine countenance—**
how resplendent,
a visage of jade-like serenity,
a bearing faint as a crane’s.
In mind, humility and kindness,
in conduct, the great virtue ever upheld.
Longevity needs no repeated prayers,
for the true origin of nature
holds its own celestial destiny.
Sever the ties of the mundane,
awaken from the dream of the mortal world,
and return to feast at Jade Pool.

**Again—**
A stalwart talent in service of the realm,
a noble scion of the imperial house,
entrusted by imperial grace to guard Ping Mountain.
The land rests in peace—
what fortune to inspire joy!
The people are cherished as one’s own children,
laws tempered with mercy,
the foolish and stubborn shown compassion.
No partiality, no bias—
the renown of governance spreads,
resounding throughout the mortal realm.

**In leisure,**
ever accumulating virtue,
devoted to the teachings,
the heart preserved in tranquility.
Once more, honored with a summons,
a sacred altar is raised.
Through the ritual feast, the host of celestial sages is thanked,
as the azure-clad ones
open the gates of the unseen.
From this day forth,
the lofty immortals will bear witness,
and your name shall be inscribed
among the ranks of the transcendent.

*Wang Hai Chao*   *Self-Reflection*

Once, in years past, I was bound by craving and desire,
all my life’s deeds and doings—
now, in a single dawn, scattered like flying dust.
Knowing fate, I delight in Heaven’s decree,
before the wind, beneath the moon,
dwelling in seclusion by mountain and stream.
Silent as one struck dumb, like a fool,
heedless of others’ praise or blame.
All day long, no other task remains—
only to guard and preserve this little self.

Subtle and profound, the dark workings of the mysterious mechanism,
awakening to clarity, deep and still,
all merges into one refuge.
When the mood strikes, I sing and chant,
when joy arises, I dance and play,
following conditions, delighting in my emptiness and stillness.
No care for outward appearance,
freely indulging in carefree abandon,
at ease, without striving.
Content to pass my days in poverty and leisure,
letting the sun and moon race east and west.

*Jade Brazier: Three Streams of Snow* (Eleven Poems, originally titled *West River Moon*)
*In Response to Master Qin*

Leaning on my staff, I wander through water and clouds,
making my home wherever I go.
In grotto heavens, I recline to nurture cinnabar,
a thatched hut and wattle fence—fit for a painting.
Gathering yellow sprouts and white snow,
blending jade liquid and golden tea.
Of such sweet savor, no need for boasting—
it wins an immortal’s priceless prize.

*Hidden-Head Acrostic* (Four missing characters reconstructed as verse)

□ Greatness is not in firmness,
□ Now, deluded, clinging to home.
□ Yet awakening to purple spirit-sand,
□ Abandoning zither, chess, books, and paintings.
□ Years of diligent refinement,
□ Within, nurturing famed tea.
□ Now, knowing its flavor, why boast?
□ One day, merit perfected—priceless.

*Breaking the Four Characters*
*For Wang Houtang of Xianyi Temple*

Seeking the swiftest path to cultivation,
let not the horse lag nor the monkey run wild.
In every thing, sever all entanglements—
why ask of coiled serpents and tortoises?
Keep the spirit-terrace ever luminous,
naturally, the true breath will flow unbroken.
The immortal maiden within—fair of face—
is none other than your original countenance.

*For An Baozhen and Others*

Fish lost in the ford of suffering’s sea,
drifting with the waves, chasing the current.
Idly casting fragrant bait upon the hook,
in an instant, they turn their heads.
This, too, is the weight of past karma—
all things at once come to rest.
Where lies the path ahead?
Become a leader among the host of immortals.

*Again*

To transcend the sea of suffering,
first sever love and forget emotion.
From of old, level the pits and trenches,
lest you stray into desolate byways.
See through the illusions of fleeting splendor,
let no doubts or delusions arise.
With light and carefree steps, press onward—
each stride finds Penglai’s sure footing.

*Again*

Having awakened to the Way of home-leaving and Dao-seeking,
rely on a will unshakably firm.
Though myriad conditions stir in the heart,
all depends on diligent refinement.
Among the assembly, harbor no dissent,
put others’ benefit before your own.
Inner attainment and outer conduct—both perfected—
you shall attend the jade pool’s sacred feast.

*For Monk Liu of Puzhou Bodhisattva Hall*

The Great Dao makes no distinction of noble or base—
each and every person is already complete.
Let not the square inch of the heart spawn a thousand cares,
but keep every thought returning to purity and stillness.
Having grasped this message,
no need to bow the body or weary the form.
The spirit-terrace, brighter than the icy moon,
illumines the seeds of ignorance.

*Sighing for the Fire-and-Smoke Sons of Home-Leaving*

Some seek truth and yearn for the Dao—
pitiful, deserving of sighs.
Forsaking meat, abstaining from wine, shunning rank odors,
they take up the conduct of home-leaving.
In solitude, they close their eyes and knit their brows,
before others, they speak of the Dao and discourse on Chan.
Yet the slightest touch sets them ablaze—
all their former knowledge and insight, undone.

*Subtle Function*

No need to debate the public cases of ancients—
only present my own gate’s style.
At the third watch, the third stroke of the fast-breaking bell—
this is my family’s subtle function.
Limpid as empty flowers in form,
luminous as the moon in water’s reflection.
Two phases of this message—one in essence—
see how you might grasp and wield it.

*Double Extinction*

What words can speak of the ancestral Dao?
What discourse can touch the true lineage?
To move the lips and wag the tongue is already amiss—
it betrays the heart-seal of all immortals.
Thus, it is hard to expound,
yet I dare not refrain from a brief disclosure:
In every thing, the whole body is revealed—
in these words, I ask you to acknowledge it.

*In Gratitude for a Daoist Friend’s Visit*

Clumsy and weary of worldly profit,
indolent, I love only mountain dwelling.
Learning that a Daoist friend delights in calling,
I come to forge a bond of wondrous affinity.
I only wish to ascend the realm of longevity,
and further pray to deeply awaken to emptiness.
Laying down the toils of the dusty world, severing a myriad cares—
beyond the heights, where white clouds run deep.

*Golden Brazier: One Stream of Clouds* (Four Poems, originally titled *A Stretch of Clouds on Mount Wu*)
*For Sun Zhidao and Wang Juyi*

On purple paths, a traveler burdened by cares,
in red dust, a household bound by fame and profit.
All day long, vainly toiling—
no way to keep company with mist and clouds.
If you awaken to the brevity of this floating life,
Penglai’s immortal halls lie but a hand’s span away.
Hungry, eat; thirsty, drink; weary, sleep—
all else is without entanglement.

*Again*

Wind stilled, clouds first gathered,
tide level, waves at peace.
Idly wielding a light oar, clad in a straw cloak,
I angle near the riverbank.
The azure sky, so clear, like water—
how much more when the moon shines bright and the wind is gentle?
Alas, the fish and turtles refuse the hook—
I stand alone on the desolate isle of reeds.

*Parable of the Skull*

Day after day, lost in flowers and wine,
morning after morning, contending for power and wealth.
Suddenly, life ends, the grave is sealed—
on the outskirts, bleached bones lie exposed.
Though beaten with sticks and pounded with rods,
they are not as sharp and foolish as before.
I urge you to early awakening to this cause—
beyond the world, engage in true cultivation.

*Parable of the Puppet*

Faces painted in outlandish guise,
bodies swiftly assembled and joined.
Bowing and scraping, twisting and turning—so many postures,
yet all are but manipulated by others.
Of their own accord, they shake their heads and mimic shadows,
daily racing across the stage.
One day, the strings break, the pulling ceases—
only then do they awaken to the falsity of such causes.

*Little Layered Mountain*
*Expressing My Feelings*

With sudden awakening, I leap from the cage of worldly toil.
How many affairs fill the breast—all turn to emptiness.
Beyond the dust, I feign foolish simplicity in carefree ease.
Truly unshackled, truly free—
this is indeed the finest family tradition.

Opening the door to face the pine-clad peaks,
red dust cannot reach me here, deep in the white clouds.
The heart of Dao does not share the heart of profit.
I open my embrace,
reclining high to nurture indolent leisure.

*Six Golden Robust Cries of Jade Splendor*
*(Originally titled "Reduced-Word Magnolia Flower")*

*Exhorting Dao Companions*
The wondrous Dao of Perfect Truth:
first lay low the self and others.
The wondrous Dao perfects truth—
decisively gather essence, qi, and spirit.
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled,
cast off the skin-sack without a care.
When conduct is fulfilled and merit complete,
pay homage before Master Danyang.

*Again*
Nonaction, purity, and stillness—
tiger coils and dragon twines, returning to great samādhi.
Purity, stillness, and nonaction:
mother and child harmonize, moving in and out together.
Carefree and at ease,
coming and going without entanglement.
At ease and carefree,
I leave it all to mountains and forests, or the marketplace.

*Again*
Not-human and human—
seeing through it all, it is but a trifling matter.
Human and not-human—
like spring wind blowing past the ear.
True merit, true conduct:
restrain the mind-horse and heart-ape within.
True conduct, true merit:
throughout the twelve hours, refine and refine the surging qi.

*For Dao Companion of Luo Family Manor*
Luo Manor, a realm unto itself,
winding waters encircle the mountains in mutual embrace.
Land lovely, people worthy,
revering the Dao, honoring truth, sowing seeds of good karma.
You invited me here,
offerings made with tireless devotion.
No way to repay such virtue—
only wishing each household flourishing longevity.

*For Master Hu*
Descendant of the Zi and Lin clans,
your discourse lofty, surpassing the crowd in distinction.
From birth, your bones were numinous, your flesh refined—
half your countenance already noble, emerging into the world with marvel.
You honor the Three Teachings,
revering the Buddha, the Sage, and walking the great Dao.
Silently nurturing the immortal embryo,
soon the white lotus will bloom amidst the flames.

*For Lady Wan Yan Ming Hui of Pengwei County*
The air is crisp and severe,
all things root deeply and secure their stems.
The *ming* leaves fully unfurl—
the immortal maiden moves her true self down from the jeweled terrace.
Pine’s bearing, crane’s form,
casting off burdens, purifying the heart, surpassing the crowd in distinction.
To celebrate her long life:
may fortune and longevity together attain the measure of Mustard Seed City.

*Eight "Treading Clouds" Songs*
*(Originally titled "Treading the Grass")*

*Self-Diversion*
Ren and Gui just ascended,
Bing and Ding already descended.

Watering and nurturing, the yellow sprout grows tall.
The numinous youth plucks it and ascends to the Jasper Palace,
where reed pipes and flutes welcome him with resonant song.
Tigers roar with auspicious winds,
dragons churn the snowy waves.
The turning of creation rests with the true master.
Refining cinnabar, the moonlight clears—
where the *Treading Clouds* dance, divine radiance gleams.

---

Pure and tranquil is the household’s way,
a livelihood of non-action.
Within lies a hidden truth.
In stillness and clarity, the profound mechanism is grasped;
in the boundless and indistinct, the subtle principle is known.
Atop the Seven Treasures Mountain,
within the Five Luminous Palaces,
freely savoring the nectar’s taste.
Sober yet drunk, drunk yet sober—
sober again, then drunk once more.

---

Worldly affairs swirl in chaos,
worldly passions stir in turmoil.
In spare moments, such thoughts are truly laughable.
When will the rise and fall of gain and loss cease?
When will the cycles of rise and ruin end?
Though present today,
who can guarantee tomorrow?
Listen well and recognize the Dao of non-action.
When cultivation and merit are both complete,
laughing, you’ll point to Penglai Isle amid the clouds.

*For Scholar Li of Anshan*
Enough of "alas" and "how"—
of "this" and "that."
Awakened, it’s best to cast them all aside.

Instructing the young and ignorant wastes the spirit,
lest habit and delay turn your hair to snow.
The years fly like arrows—
how can you bear to let them pass in vain?
I earnestly reveal the secrets of immortal cultivation:
if you’re willing to climb the cinnabar cassia branch,
you’ll share with me the moon of eternal life.

*For Liang the Scholar and his nephew of Luojia Village, who piously seek land to build an abbey*
Before Longling Peak,
behind Luojia Village—
mountains and rivers here are truly bright and fair.
If now you build a Daoist abbey,
in years to come it shall draw immortals to its halls.
I write these new verses
as modest praise and blessing.
Fortune and good omens have always followed virtue.
Uncle and nephew briefly forge a bond of action,
while their descendants shall enjoy boundless longevity.

*For the Assembly of Changchun Township at Chongdao Abbey*
The township bears the name "Eternal Spring,"
the abbey is called "Venerating the Dao."
Its hidden mysteries are hard for men to fathom.
Let not the radiance of Eternal Spring wither,
and with sincere hearts, turn the wheel of venerating the Dao.
Shut out the clamor,
delve within to seek the wondrous.
Ever hold fast to patience, humility, and modesty.
A wind of wisdom scatters the clouds atop the ridge,
and the moon of true nature shines with brilliant splendor.

*For Yang Deyuan*
His Daoist name is "Peaceful Leisure,"
his dharma name, "Virtue Distant."
Dharma name and Daoist name open the gate of expedience.
In peaceful leisure, let the nature roam free;
awakening to virtue’s distance, return to truth and goodness.
Outwardly appearing simple,
inwardly mastering cultivation.
Pressing on with effort, advancing the fire as in battle.
The golden crow flies toward Qujiang Pool,
the jade toad leaps from the Hall of Luminous Clarity.

For Yang Deyuan’s Request

The Dao is fundamentally wordless,
yet you press for words, demand explanations.
Poetry and song are but forced interpretations—
in its original state, the body abides in true constancy,
responding to circumstances without the slightest hindrance.
Moving freely in and out,
coming and going at ease,
before your eyes shines a radiant clarity.
If you dare accept this in an instant,
without shifting a single step, you transcend the Three Realms.

*Gazing Toward Penglai* (Three Poems, originally titled *Gazing at the River South*)

*For Elder Brother Zhongwu*

Often I laugh,
for delusion and awakening differ entirely.
Your livelihood is wealth and honor,
my life, quiet and carefree.
High pillowed, I recline amidst mist and clouds.

The joy of longevity,
how pure and fine its delight!
At leisure, I keep company with the thousand-year crane,
idly watching flowers that never fade through the four seasons.
Where might one find the home of immortals?

*For Magistrate Wang at Taolin Pass*

Scion of a noble lineage,
your pure reputation has long been heard.
By chance we met beyond the green peaks,
lingering together by Jade Spring’s edge,
our discourse in perfect accord with the true teaching.

Since parting,
we have met again without cause.
I fear your spiritual insight may be obscured by desire,
so I dare not refuse my clumsy, wild verses—
my intent entrusted to this brush and paper.

*For Scholar Zhang the Fourth*

O descendant of the Qing River,
hear the root of this matter:
in the past, you never found the raft to cross the shore,
and now you’ve entered the downhill years,
still bound by worldly attachments.

The realm of splendor,
illusory and unsteady.
Do not dream within a dream again,
nor seek the mysterious within the mysterious.
Mend the heavens within the cave.

*Three Poems on Freeing the Mind* (Originally titled *Nian Nu Jiao*)

*On Bamboo, Respectfully Following the Rhyme of Master Changchun*

A single stalk of bamboo,
possessing a natural standard,
towering and solitary.
Beyond the balustrade, before the window, its emerald shadows stretch—
its elegance far from the vulgar.
Within, its heart is hollow;
without, its integrity lofty,
surpassing all common trees.
In quiet recitation of wind and moon,
its resonance is like jade struck upon ice.

How lovable its pure essence and noble bearing,
drawing cranes to perch and phoenixes to nest,
through all seasons delighting the eye.
Its lush leaves, layer upon layer, gleam sleek and smooth,
its supple branches swaying, dense with green.
Its roots twist like dragons and serpents,
its qi infuses shoots and bamboo,
their flavor surpassing meat and grain.
This gentleman of refinement,
shares with me boundless good fortune.

*Double Ninth*

Mist and light, clear and verdant,
stirred by the west wind—
once more the Double Ninth arrives in leisure.
Red leaves and yellow blossoms alternate,
a scene truly worthy of painting.
In years past on this day,
silken robes and strings, feasts and golden cups flew.
Now, in retrospect,
all has become an empty dream.

Having entered the mysterious gate by good fortune,
worldly attachments of every kind
leave not the slightest trace.
A thatched hut, a brushwood fence, set one against the other—
pure and serene, ever refined.
All day, words forgotten;
through the night, sleepless,
I willingly endure this carefree life.
Who shares my aspiration?
Together we speak of the wordless truth.

*Lamenting the World*

The moon and sun hasten,
silently urging a man’s temples to silver.
All day he toils, yet remains unenlightened,
driven by the fires of family cares.
The empty fame of a snail’s horn,
the paltry profit of a fly’s head—
what good do they bring?
Hearing of health and strength,
best seek the living path among the clouds.

Sweeping my sleeves, I cast off worldly bonds,
by water’s edge, upon stone,
laughing freely as I compose idle verses.
A single grain of divine elixir gleams bright,
sparing me the entanglements of worldly dust.
Unfettered and at ease,
I wander where I will,
grasping the true message.
When merit is complete, I shall depart,
to dwell forever on Penglai’s immortal isle.

*Four Poems to the Tune of "Linjiang Xian"*

*Admonishing Debates Among Buddhists and Daoists*

Chan and Dao originally need no debate,
yet ancient sages forced them into names.
No need for those beyond the world to labor in vain—
each person has their portion,
everyone is perfectly complete.
Simply lay down the ten thousand entanglements,
and sever ignorance without hesitation.
In Jetavana’s garden, roam freely.
Where the mud ox roars,
midday strikes the third watch.

*For Shi Yu Xian and Others*

Bowing my head, I urge those on the same path to heed the teachings,
lest you waste the passing years.
Ever awaken and reflect, your Dao-heart steadfast.
Embrace others’ faults,
correct your own deviations.
In your true nature, there is no self or other—
in stillness, recognize the root source.
But deluded by false unions, you grasp at connections,
forever sinking in the sea of affliction,
unable to attain the Great Heavenly Net.

*Evening Scene*

As evening approaches, a gentle coolness stirs at door and window,
alone I sit on the pine-clad crag, chin in hand.
From on high, my gaze spans the horizon—
a solitary city veiled in mist and trees,
a distant shore where a single sail returns.
For ten thousand miles, the azure sky is clear as water,
clouds idle, unmoving in the slightest.
Bright and luminous, they play in the radiant sunlight.
A perfect light embraces the dharma realm,
its splendor shining upon the Jade Pool.

*Playfully Composed Upon Hearing the Cuckoo*

A mind at leisure grows weary of idleness,
carefree and unconcerned, I forget all schemes.
At dawn, a light rain passes the window.
Emerald mists enfold the green peaks—
again, I hear the cuckoo’s cry.
Each call rings clear: "Better to go home!"
Now my time to return has come.
When merit is complete, I shall step upon the clouds.
Why trouble with clever arguments,
vainly urging one another on?

*Guest at the Blue Lotus Pond* (Originally titled *Green Jade Case*)

*For Wu Lin Da Derun*

Now that you have awakened to the suffering of worldly toil,
your body has already met its fate.
Cast aside vanity, embrace simplicity.
Ever hold fast to gentleness and humility,
never give rise to greed or envy—
let your words and deeds match.
In stillness, do not stir idle thoughts,
and you will grasp the wondrous mystery of leisure.
Nurture the Three Fields without cease,
day or night.
Yin recedes, yang grows,
qi congeals, the elixir forms—
only then may you be called a companion of the Perfect Truth.

*Two Poems from "Immortal of Yellow Crane Cave"* (Originally titled *Bu Suan Zi*)

*For the Assembly*

I urge those who cultivate immortality:
each must remain patient and enduring.
Through ten thousand hardships and a thousand demons,
let your resolve grow stronger—
never alter your initial resolve.
Like the full moon’s light,
radiant and serene beyond the vast sky,
turning without partiality to fill the great thousand worlds,
trust that the floating clouds will disperse.

*For Cheng the Third*

A man is like a candle in the wind—
who would turn their heart to look back?
Worldly ties bind tightly,
how could one not feel the suffering?
Fortunately, there is the path of immortal cultivation,
to be pursued in leisure and ease.
Wherever you go, roam freely—
when merit is complete, dwell in Penglai and Yingzhou.

*Two Poems to the Tune of "Zhe Ying Jiao"*

**Reflections on Mountain Dwelling**

Pure and secluded, the springs and rocks—
a fine place for true wandering.
Fragrant winds scatter,
auspicious clouds appear.
Warm sun, harmonious sky,
rare birds at play from time to time.
How delightful—
all adorn the mountain dweller’s life.

Outer scenes abound,
inner scenes still harmonize.
By the elixir furnace,
tiger and dragon unite.
Fair maiden and youthful lad
often urge me to pour the golden liquid.
Deeply intoxicated,
I lie at ease amid the radiant clouds.

**To Wang Guangdao, the Oil Refiner**

Wang Guangdao,
heaven-endowed with skill and sincerity.
Kneading oil and flour,
shaping and refining with care.
Responding to things again and again,
each creation follows the heart’s intent.
True to principle—
tempered within the furnace of immortality.

Timing known, seasons observed,
he draws forth wondrous marvels.
Brilliant and bright,
fragrant to the nose.
Come, taste it—
another kind of sweetness.
How wondrous!
Worthy to offer at the immortals’ feast.

---

**To the Tune "Joyous Oriole Ascending"**
*For Kang Deji*

Deep karmic roots.
Early awakened—
this floating life is but a dream.
Turning from youthful ambition,
devoting the heart to the Dao,
worldly affairs cast aside like screens.
To escape the wheel of death and rebirth,
recognize the original handle.
What is the standard?
I shall reveal to you
a swift and sure path.

In daily practice,
maintain clarity and stillness.
Cultivate inner power,
outward conduct in equanimity.
Next, dissolve greed and wrath,
harmonize spirit and qi,
never let the horse and monkey run wild.
A thousand miles of dark clouds disperse—
a single point of numinous light shines.
The immortal’s path is steady.
This time, you must escape
the cycle of rebirth and transformation.

**Eight Poems to the Tune "Recalling Prince Wang"**
*Self-Reflection*

**How does one become a fool?**
Only from knowing worldly affairs too well.
Passing days with fate, no greed beyond.
Dwelling in Cloud Hermitage—
thirst quenched with *tīrtha*, the taste grows sweet.

---

**Carefree and vast, free from sorrow,**
what care for flowing springs and returning autumns?
Sleeping sound in the open, the white ox set loose.
Evening mist gathers—
a single song at the ancient ferry’s head.

---

**No fasting, no precepts, no scriptures read,**
no talk of golden elixirs or the Five Phases.
Idly tuning the jade zither beneath the bright moon,
notes light and pure—
resounding through the twelve tiers of Jade Terrace.

---

**The Three Fields plowed ever by iron ox,**
planting yellow sprouts that slowly grow.
Dharma rain waters them ceaselessly,
turning lush and flourishing—
harvested and borne to Jade Capital.

---

**How many have learned my ease?**
All worldly ties severed, all cares dissolved.
Leisurely playing the Qiang flute, riding the white ox—
what fine cause!
The four great spirit-boats drift as they will.

---

**The true nature itself is called immortal—**
for love of seclusion, far from the marketplace.
Alone in the mountain hall, mystery most profound.
Joy in tranquility—
happy, I sing; weary, I sleep.

---

**The four seasons turn swift as a shuttle,**
a hundred years of splendor pass at a finger’s count.
Only wishing all may escape the river of desire,
nurturing harmony—
when merit is full, ascend to the Great Canopy.

---

**For Two Old Friends, Wangsun and Another, Who Met Unexpectedly on the Same Day**

Leisurely, leisurely recalling Prince Wang,
today by fortune we meet, words and laughter frequent.
Each diligently refining essence, qi, and spirit—
practice perfected,
together feasting in Peach Spring’s jade-green cavern.

---

**Four Poems to the Tune "Leaving Home" (Originally "Southern Home")**
**Admonishing the World**

Men are by nature immortals—
only for letting horse and monkey run wild at first.
Bone changed, form altered without cease,
endlessly—
binding them to dust and passion in all its forms.

**If one grasps how to secure the root and origin,**
in jade crucible and golden furnace mercury and lead converge.
Refining three thousand merits, when practice is full,
return to the source—
reascend Penglai and Yingzhou, beyond all change and decay.

**[Snowy Night]**
I dwell in seclusion in Clear Spirit Grotto on Kunlun Mountain,
often practicing sleeplessness. After long sitting,
I did not notice the snowfall.
That night grew slightly warm; half-melted icicles from the cliffs
seemed to make a sound.
Suddenly rising, I stepped outside to look—
the mountains on all sides had transformed entirely.
Leaning against a pine, I composed this lyric.

Sitting long, my eyes grew heavy with drowsiness,
unaware the heavens displayed their auspicious signs.
The night warmed, and I suddenly heard the dripping of cliff icicles,
drop by drop—
awakening, my dream of wandering immortals could not take form.

I rose, climbing the steps to open the latch,
gazing afar—all distant peaks had changed.
Only the tall pines, of nature distinct,
stood steadfast.
Alone, I leaned against the secluded crag, the Dao’s clarity revealed.

**[To a Clan Member]**
My ancestral home lies in Lizhou. A certain Immortal Li
came from there, saying that among my kin in springtime,
they heard I had entered the Dao many years ago.
They know not which branch of the Wang family I belong to—
I was asked to send word.
Thus I composed this lyric to send to them.

A few words on concealment and action:
can the cycles of birth and death ever be measured?

Unrelenting, the stubborn heart deludes with love and desire,
ever more manifest—
through endless ages, never reaching home.
Fortunate to meet Ancestor Chongyang,
who revealed the Quanzhen Way for transcending the world.
I send word to my clan: awaken,
ponder deeply—
this one has never borne the surname Wang.

**[To Cui Miaoxin]**
A true and luminous master,
vast as the Hongfan, wondrous in emergence.
Fragrance, taste, color, sound—none can cling,
know this well:
though waves surge, the shore stands unmoved.
Recognize this, let no doubt arise,
waste no effort chasing outward.
In sitting, lying, standing, walking—hold fast,
contemplate:
with every blink and brow’s lift, who is it?

**[Two Lyrics to the Tune "Qinlouyue"]**

**On the Pine**
A traveler of mist and clouds,
towering, hidden beside the secluded crag.
Beside the secluded crag,
frost oppresses, snow weighs—
yet not the slightest hindrance.
Gnarled branches sway beyond the cold clouds,
its natural form and substance truly lovable.
Truly lovable—
verdant, distinct,
a singular bearing.

**On the Bamboo**
Of steadfast purity,
supple branches and tender leaves fit for painting.
Fit for painting—
through all seasons, ever companion
to the thatched hall’s wind and moon.
Lofty and unyielding, its nature uniquely noble,
hollow-hearted, forever undecaying.
Forever undecaying—
green shade swaying,
auspicious tones, pure and exquisite.

**[Five Lyrics to the Tune "Fenglouwu"]**

**Mountain Dwelling, Idle Thoughts**
All around, green pines and bamboo.
Shaded and bright, the mountain home—
what care for idle honor or disgrace?
Alone, I chant and pour fine wine,
its rich flavor intoxicates; drunk, I sleep in my robes.
Awakening from a clear dream, desire remains unfulfilled.
Again I embrace the jade zither,
playing the melody of *No-Birth*.
Who is the knowing companion at my side?
The thatched hall’s wind and moon should approve.

**To Fellow Daoists**
Worldly affairs, tangled—what suffering they bring!
Death and birth, coming and going,
the wheel of reincarnation never ceases.
Fortunate to have perfected ones open the Dharma hall,
guiding people onto the path of *No-Birth*.
Travelers on this path, heed my words:
devote yourself sincerely,
cherish the Dao, forget thoughts and worries.
The work of clarity and stillness shines forth—
on the path of *No-Birth*, we shall ever meet.

**Exhorting the Springtime Wanderer**
Tender willows hang golden, blossoms burst open.
Everywhere in gardens and groves,
the sleeve-sweeping fragrance of wind delights.
Endless before the eyes, idle scenes—
only to adorn the splendor of spring.
Young riders gallop in lively throngs,
heedless of prosperity’s
stealthy change of rosy complexion.
In the end, emotion cannot endure—
earnestly I tell the flower-seekers this.

**Hearing the Oriole in Late Spring**
The fleeting light hastens—how swiftly it presses!
Bright sun, gentle wind,
again send spring’s light to dusk.
Gradually I hear the flowing oriole’s speech on the branch,
warbling as if pouring out its heart.
Yesterday, flowers bloomed red across the trees—
now they have scattered,
wildly chasing flying catkins.
I urge the wanderers to awaken to life:
do not lose the path you came by.

**Three Days Before Qingming, After a Light Rain, Presented to All**
Sever love, forget emotion—be ever vigilant.
The hare runs, the crow flies,
hurrying the passing years.
Again Qingming draws near—
every household’s smoke and fire must be guarded with care.
Harmonious qi, misty and dense, is precious fortune.
Fine rain hangs like a curtain,
not betraying spring’s promise.
Nature’s work continues thus,
immortal blossoms drifting, trailing fragrant tones.

**[Three Lyrics to the Tune "Shangdanxiao"] (Originally "Shangpingxi")**
*Using Zhang Ziyun’s Rhymes*

**I**
Attaining true leisure,
pursuing true delight,
scorning duckweed and tumbleweed.
Let fate run its course—
obstruction or smooth passage.
A life of quiet simplicity,
twenty years since I set aside the golden goblet.
Everywhere, turning the light inward,
dispelling darkness and confusion—
the spirit’s mirror is not bronze.
Sometimes I play
in the red dust’s realm,
sometimes I dwell in seclusion
beside green crags and pines.
Grasping the reins of Tan and Ma,
their legacy of style remains.
Driving the workings of creation,
naturally the tiger and dragon mate.
Ascending to the pure heavens,
how dare I linger in indolence to vie for first?

**II**
Abandoning fleeting glory,
forgetting entangling snares,
freer than autumn’s tumbleweed.
Delighting in Heaven’s mandate,
all encounters flow smoothly.
Following conditions, a single meal suffices—
what need for a thousand bushels of emolument?
Content in idleness, guarding simplicity,
enduring poverty’s clarity—
why care for stubborn bronze?
Accompanying cloud companions,
inviting wind and moon,
facing the creek’s stones,
before the crag’s pines.
Discussing the serene,
the family style of transcending the world.
Refining gold, cooking jade,
turning the female tiger and dark dragon.
Now, once more awakened,
all ties are empty—
the mind weary, the will indolent.

**Entering the Dao**
Death and life press,
the wheel of rebirth urges—
no respite from toil.
Toward the ford of delusion,
the bitter sea, all vie to race.
Meeting this sagely age,
true immortals descend teachings to deliver the lost.
Suddenly awakened,
the dream of floating life—
estranged from frivolity and excess.
Hair like tumbleweed,
face like grime,
spirit like drunkenness, demeanor like stupidity.
Abiding in leisure,
probing the profound and subtle.
Auspicious signs appear—
few in this dusty world would know.
A numinous wind drifts,
the cosmos stilled—
moonlight illumines Hua and Yi.

**[Two Lyrics to the Tune "Chaozhongcuo"]**

**Abandoning the Common**

**The Official Path**

The official path flows like water—
eastward, gains and losses never cease.
What matter prince or peasant?
The limit of impermanence arrives, none can stay.

Far better to cast off fame’s shackles,
to spare oneself vain sorrow.
One day, when the three cinnabar elixirs align,
I’ll ride the clouds to seek Penglai’s isles.

*Matching Master Sun Yuanming’s Rhyme*

Suddenly casting off worldly affairs,
I pass the boundless years in knowing fate.
Monopolizing the grass-thatched hall’s wind and moon,
serene—yet to whom could I boast?

In this life, I hold fast to freedom,
nurturing cinnabar in the precious tripod.
Only when the ninefold transmutation is complete
will I drift as a dweller of the sea-girt isles.

**Three Lyrics to the Tune "Su Zhongqing"**

**The Ninth Day**

On the Double Ninth, joy runs deep—
ascending heights, the finest delight.
Sky vast, water clear, mountains fair,
frost-touched leaves fall through sparse woods.

Enhancing refined pleasure,
aiding quiet verse, soothing the dust-laden heart.
Wine cups brim, overflowing,
pure melodies played anew—
who is the true kindred spirit?

*Matching an Ancient Rhyme*

Where auspicious clouds drift lies the immortal’s home,
pillowed high on mist and rosy clouds.
Guiding and drawing the inner images,
the Jade Hare pairs with the Dark Crow.

Content with plainness,
discarding light gauze, far from vanity.
Body revering the Three Teachings,
heart honoring the Three Luminaries,
head crowned with the Three Flowers.

**To Elder Wei**

Long life comes from indulgence at home,
slanting sunlight meets lingering glow.
Unnoticed, hair turns hoary white—
rare to find it raven-black again.

Teeth decay,
eyes veiled by gauze, dimmed in splendor.
What differs this twilight year
from rain striking the mournful paulownia,
wind shaking the wanton blossoms?

**Three Lyrics to the Tune "Xingxiangzi"**

*Self-Portrait*

**Cloud-Water Life**

A cloud-water life—wherever one goes, there is home.
Far from floating fame, floating profit, floating vanity.
The Three Palaces rise and descend, without deviation above or below.
Essential to bind the numinous embryo,
gather the numinous essence,
and assemble the numinous sprout.

Pure joys lie deep and distant—what more could be added?
Freely, joyously, drink the flowing rosy clouds.
When the Great Elixir ripens,
ride the immortal raft homeward.
Then trail jade pendants,
sway jade ornaments,
and wear jade blossoms.

**Remembering the Master’s Teachings**

The Master, styled White Cloud, named Cinnamon, sobriquet Everlasting—
from youth awakened to leave the dust,
refining mercury, smelting silver.
Grasping the transformations within the flask,
harmonizing tiger and dragon,
nurturing the nascent yang.
Manifesting the ever-present visage,
the original face,
the fundamental body.

Clouds and water as neighbors,
wind and moon as constant kin.
Only when the wondrous mystery is penetrated
is one truly called a Perfected.
Recalling the Master’s compassionate instruction,
slightly different from ordinary folk—
styled Everlasting,
named Cinnamon,
called White Cloud.

**Addressing the Assembly, Reusing the Previous Rhyme**

Why speak of root and dust,
debate lead and silver?
The path of immortals and buddhas
is clearly divided.
No need for external seeking,
no need to tax the spirit.
If you wish for wholeness,
fully embrace the Dao,
reveal the whole body.

View all as one,
without distinction of near or far.
Aspire to be ever pure,
ever still,
ever true.
Not only benefiting oneself,
but also benefiting others.
Certain to weave auspicious light,
achieve auspicious omens,
and tread upon auspicious clouds.

**Four Poems to the Tune "Flowers Filling the Path"**

**To Daoist Friend Changli Who Came to Visit**

In early years, I forgot worldly burdens,
dwelling among clouds and water at heaven’s edge.
Clustered peaks conceal my humble abode,
nurturing my foolishness.
Desolate and plain, silently guarding thusness.
Deep gratitude to the esteemed true friend,
who, staff in hand, did not shrink from the distant journey to my mountain retreat.
Alas, my gate’s wind is cold and desolate,
my hospitality crude.
Your subtle words, repeated admonitions,
awaken me from trivialities.
The perilous road ahead—
recognize the wondrous origin.
In every single thing,
a measure of numinous light,
inherently lacking nothing, needing nothing.

**To Little Cui**

What is most bitter in the human realm?
Speaking of it stirs sorrow for you.
The scenes of arising and ceasing before your eyes,
fleeting as shadows.
Empty fame, meager profit—
follow your portion, seek little.
Fortunately, in this fine season,
seizing the moment to steal leisure,
I seek cloud companions and rosy-cloud friends.
How much better to suddenly awaken and turn back,
roaming beyond the mundane.
With broad sleeves and flowing robe,
what elegance!
The myriad dusty affairs—
all swept away with a single stroke.
Polishing the precelestial treasure,
glittering and radiant,
just like the bright moon in autumn.

**On New Year’s Day to Feng Liu and Others**

The seasons repeatedly shift,
cold and heat alternate.
Time, a galloping steed through a crack—
so the ancients and moderns transmit.
At dawn, ten thousand households
laugh and celebrate the new year.
Who would turn their light inward,
to see youthful dark hair
gradually turn to hoary white?
May all people early awaken to the root and source,
searching for the mystery within the wondrous.
Beneath the grotto-heaven’s wind and moon,
dance the immortal embryo.
The alchemical spoon brimming,
a single Great Elixir perfected.
Holding it, ascend the azure sky’s path,
step by step beyond life and death,
heedless of seas turning to mulberry fields.

**To Daoist Friends of the Two Mountains: Wulin, Da, and Others**

The southeast’s scenic land,
gaze afar, mist and haze locked in embrace.
Sea and mountains gather rare beauty,
yielding outstanding worthies.
People here are auspicious and kind,
calming thoughts, silencing clamor.
Everywhere, companions gather,
exploring the wondrous and profound,
together cultivating otherworldly causes.
May from this, devotion to the Dao grow ever firmer,
awakening early to the profound mystery.
Diligently nurturing,
the lotus in the fire.
Pure fragrance, rich and lush,
passed on without cease.
One day, when true merit is complete,
sleeve swept, clouds in hand,
directly transcend the supreme heavens of humans and gods.

**Two Poems to the Tune "Immortal in the Moon"**

*Returning Light*

**Through kalpas of benighted delusion,**
bound by the snares of love and attachment,
long have I clung in blind obsession.
Vying for precedence, jostling for rank—
watching the towering waves and surging tides,
how could I heed the peril of drowning?

Fortunate now to awaken,
I brush my sleeves, open my heart,
and roam with unbounded joy.
Reflecting on past affairs,
every step and trace of my journey
now appear as grievous foes.

Lightly I become a man of leisure,
beneath the shadows of green pines,
amid the drifts of white clouds.
Content and at ease,
I pass the days in song, laughter, and conversation,
flowing with circumstance.
As evening deepens, refined delight grows—
facing the mirror of heaven,
its limpid azure vast and clear.
One by one, the silver toad ascends,
radiant, leaving the traces of the Three Isles behind.

**Gazing at the Sea**

The summer’s heat now wanes,
gradually clouds withdraw from the four wilds,
mountains and seas gleam in clarity.
From on high, I cast my gaze—
beholding the boundless ocean,
eastward stretching without end.
Vast and still, wind and waves at peace,
again and again manifesting
auspicious omens and blessings.
Great is the primal form of the Mysterious Origin,
serene and vast,
floating with the power of heaven and earth.
Its divine workings and sacred might defy measure,
trusting in the turning of the归墟,
ceaseless and unending.
Expanding the myriad transformations,
clouds and creatures soar,
fish and dragons play.
Blending the beauty of a thousand ages,
concealed within the Three Isles,
the wondrous realms of the Ten Continents.
Only when merit is complete at last
shall I ride the whale, laughing and carefree,
transcending beyond all.

**Two Poems to the Tune "Joy of Meeting Heaven"**

*Attainment*

Awakening to the illusory shifts of floating life,
swiftly cast aside love and attachment.
Unwashed face, disheveled hair,
clad in hemp and paper,
adrift to the ends of sea and sky.
Breaking strength, blunting sharpness,
embracing softness, weakness, and poverty,
forgetting sorrow, forgetting shame.
Even the stubborn mule and restless ape
suddenly cease, vanishing without trace.

A touch of the wondrous, profound principle—
facing the limpid azure heavens,
it bears the flavor of another realm.
*Lalā-lī-lā*, lips singing, tongue loose,
what restraint or hindrance remains?
Again and again, I bow in reverence,
grateful for my teacher’s guidance
in years past.
One day, I shall follow,
joining the Peach Banquet together.

**To Cai Dehou**

By a thousand means and ten thousand expedients,
you have revealed the path of cultivation,
one by one.
The supreme Dao is profound and obscure,
its subtle mechanism distant and elusive—
it demands utmost diligence and toil.
Fleeting as the blossoms of spring,
mindful of the precious turning of fortune’s wheel,
how can one bear to waste it in vain?
This karmic connection,
once lost, is hard to encounter again.

Hear my earnest exhortations:
return to the familiar ground of old,
scrutinize carefully, lest error arise.
The candle of nature shines bright,
the flower of the heart blooms resplendent,
unfolding boundless pure fragrance.
Act thus,
and naturally the lofty immortals
will secretly bestow their protection.
When merit is complete and the work perfected,
you shall step onto the path of cinnabar clouds.

**Five Poems to the Tune "Intoxicated Peach Spring" (Originally "Ruan Lang Returns")**

*Fishing at Wulin: To the Second Young Master*

This life’s grandeur is the karma of past lives,
clearly explained to the worthy.
Turn your head early, awaken to the root,
lest the mundane world entangle you.

Search the secret, visit the profound,
refine mercury and lead within the furnace.
When true merit and true practice fulfill the three thousand,
you shall ascend as a great immortal.

**To Lady Zhao**

**To Precept Master Zhao**

The path of cultivation lies smooth and level,
you must only sever love and passion.
Wayward thoughts and wild fancies no longer cling—
the Three Corpses’ power naturally lightens.

In sitting and lying,
in dwelling and moving,
ever rest in unbroken stillness and clarity.
One morning, suddenly, the numinous shines forth,
radiant, dazzling, bright.

**To Precept Master Wu Gu Lun**

A few words dispel the gloom of the crossroads,
worldly passions stand severed at once.
Form is emptiness, emptiness is form—
the two differ not,
the true principle never false.

Ever serene,
the body abides in suchness,
emerging from the cycle of birth and death.
The moon of the nature, solitary in the limpid pool,
casts its light to the four quarters.

**To Precept Master Shan Yuan**

Originally the single point called *maṇi*,
solemn and majestic beyond worldly marvels.
Following conditions, responding to things, acting freely,
perfect clarity accords with the pattern.

Now manifesting function,
now concealed in mystery,
the numinous light comes and goes at will.
Only recognize the correct path without doubt,
and you shall return beyond the clouds, beyond the world.

**To Lady Perfect-Completion of the Storehouse Office**

The whole household, single-minded, steadfast in the Dao-heart,
all due to the karma of past lives.
Refined, strict, ever more precise and devoted,
true sincerity is truly pitiable.

Hearing the teachings,
awakening to subtle words,
worldly toils gradually fall away.
Within, harmonizing spirit and breath in unbroken flow,
when the work is complete, you shall realize immortality.

**Five Poems to the Tune "Moon of the Heart Shines on Cloud Creek" (Originally "Crossing the Mountain Stream")**

*Mountain Dwelling: Expressing My Feelings*

Having cast off the fiery household,
worldly affairs are hard to restrain.
Beyond things, joy in carefree wandering,
far removed from levies and taxes.
Coarse robes and plain fare,
content with my lot, following conditions,
beside green peaks, amid white clouds,
I alone claim pure leisure.

A thatched hut, one roof,
fitting my lifelong wish.
Just enough to shelter the face,
no need for embellishment or excess.
The lattice window, still and silent,
I indulge in untroubled sleep.
The red sun climbs,
two or three rods high,
yet the wicker gate remains barred.

*Again*

Five peaks rise in beauty,
dripping jade, misty light rich and smooth.

**The Qi’s Might Presses the Azure Deep**

The qi’s might presses the azure deep,
facing misty waves, cloud-surges boundless.
In verdant cliffs’ depths,
a Daoist’s home half-concealed,
forgetting favor and disgrace,
cutting off pride,
seeing through the human world.
Wild passions, secluded joys—
who envies the noble and ministerial?
Leisurely wielding wondrous mystery,
watching tiger and dragon
coil and play in sport.
Youthful boy, radiant maiden,
laughing, celebrating the Golden Elixir.
When merit is complete, they depart,
treading clouds and rainbow,
revealing my auspicious signs.

*Presented to Wei Derou: Temporarily Herding Sheep to Dispel Household Demons*

At first, when learning the Dao,
I hoped to cast off worldly entanglements.
Yet step by step, demons arose,
and now and then, slight obstructions linger.
You must see through them.
Guard vigilantly, never waver,
with a resolute heart,
a single-minded will—
then taste the pure, cool flavor.
Where the sheep are herded,
keep watch, let none stray.
Should they wander east or west,
the master must tame and restrain.
Amid mountains and forests,
hasten back early,
for heaven darkens,
the sun sinks,
and the gates must be sealed tight.

*The Parable of Herding the Ox*

The ox’s nature is stubborn,
galloping ceaselessly without pause.
Short rod and long rope,
ever driving, ever restraining,
firmly seizing, sharply correcting.
From dawn to dusk,
in time it grows gentle and pliant.
By fragrant grass banks,
at winding river’s edge,
it lies in dew like frost and snow.
The cowherd, idle and carefree,
delights in boundless joy.
Beneath an ancient pine’s shade,
he plays a short flute,
its notes lingering, its melody choked.
Piled high, straw cloak and bamboo hat,
he claps hands, laughing as he returns.
The crisp wind blows strong,
the azure sky clears—
and there appears the moon in every home.

*Presented to Zhao Debei*

Whenever one enters the Dao,
cast off splendor early.
With softness and weakness, guard poverty,
brushing the spirit-terrace clean,
moment by moment.
When worldly thoughts arise,
contemplate them as if before death.
Rely on alms for livelihood,
letting all else be.
As days pass and months turn,
diligently refine the primordial treasure.
Silently, inwardly contain the light,
illuminating worldly entanglements,
again and again overturned.
Within nothingness, there is yet something—
this principle is most profound.
When merit is complete,
when conduct is perfected,
heaven’s decree will come of itself.

*Two Poems on Awakening from the Yellow Millet Dream (Originally "Swallows Return to the Beam")*

*Presented to Liu Jiulang*

What in this world is most lamentable?
Lost in the fiery household,
driven to and fro.
Never a moment’s respite to smooth the brow.
When will it end?
Moreover, clothing and food follow each other—
empty turmoil, what is it for?
Clearly, life and death press before the eyes.
Let go—
that is the true advantage.

*Again*

Floating fame, fleeting profit—
both drift endlessly.

To never say, "I’ll imprison this body."
Greed multiplies—defeat and sorrow follow.
What cause is there to cling?
May others see through early, withdraw in time.
All past affairs—
let them cease entirely.
Drifting beyond the world, no lingering trace.
If fate allows,
I’ll join my kindred souls.

*After the Autumn Clearing: Following Ancient Rhymes to Express My Feelings*

A reclusive household,
facing the southeast, ten thousand *li* away,
where the whale-blue sea stretches wide.
Orchid gardens and magic mushroom fields,
warm fragrant winds wafting—
no less splendid than the capital’s spring hues.
Within the pine-lined path,
tender grass carpets the ground in woven patterns.
Once more,
the crane’s summons returns in haste,
its cry still echoing through the nine heavens.
Heaven has granted me
this blessed season,
my heart stilled and clear,
a hundred cares dissolved to rest.
In leisure, I call the boy to brew tea,
jade cups lightly cradling white wave-blooms.
Spirit refreshed, qi harmonized—what barrier remains?
Moreover, the eternal Dao
silently circulates its mysterious work,
serene in non-action,
tranquil in self-attainment.

*Two Poems in the Style of "Spring in Wuling"*
*Sent to Commander Chen of Qihe Town*

Deep renown, profound benevolence, filial conduct—
near and far, all sing his praise.
I send these new verses for careful reflection,
that he may early awaken from the yellow millet dream.

Where the heart-flower first unfolds,
delicate fragrance wafts and lingers.
When the wind scatters its lingering scent into the Daoist sanctuary,
vast and clear, auspicious omens appear.

*To Liu Sichang of Leting*

Your devotion to the Dao, your sincerity—
long have I heard of them.
All is due to causes from past lives.
When shall we become neighbors,
guiding each other out of the maze of delusion?

At ease, carefree, living as fate allows,
steadfastly nurturing your celestial truth.
When the lotus blooms in fire, the sun renews each day,
eternally claiming everlasting spring.

*Four Poems on Refining Cinnabar*
*(Originally "Waves Scouring Sand")*
*For Sun Yi*

Sun Yi came to say:
"Last night, I dreamed of the Perfected One of Danyang,
who transformed me to leave the household life.
I replied, ‘My descendants are not yet established,
my family’s path not yet complete—
I fear I lack the karmic conditions to leave home.
Could I simply cultivate at home instead?’
The Perfected One laughed and said:
‘I have long declared:
Without embracing wife or child,
immortals are not found at home—
how could Lord Pengwu not know this?’
With these words, I awoke.
I know not what to make of it."
Thus, I send these verses to him.

I bow to the immortal of Fuchun,
listening to the root of the matter.
Golden willows and jade twists bind tightly—
only when your own heart resolves this
can you speak of lacking the conditions.
The words of sages in dreams
are no empty transmission.

"Household affairs await completion in every detail.
Yet I still hope to attain the fruit of the Dao in this body—
digging earth to seek heaven.

To the female disciples Guo Shouyuan and Guo Shanzhi:
I exhort the two of Fenyang,
briefly recounting the course of conduct.
With karmic conditions, the body enters the homeland of the Dao.
Worldly matters, one after another, should be pared away—
abandon the short to follow the long.
In daily practice, burn the incense of the heart,
turn the light around to reflect inward.
When encountering demons or hardship, dare to bear it.
From beginning to end, without change or wavering,
resolutely advance toward Penglai’s estate.

To the female disciple Zhang Shanxing:
Wild words speak true sincerity—
the pure assembly should listen.
Unexpectedly, white hair has grown at the temples.
Ahead, impermanence awaits as an equal—
what is there to welcome?
Only through cultivation,
with a mind broad and level,
do old, familiar states no longer entangle.
What has passed, correct again and again—
merit will naturally come to perfection.

To the disciple Nun Shan:
Firm in aspiration, she yearns for the path ahead,
startled even by honor or disgrace.
The profound meaning of the Five Thousand Characters shines clearly.
Thus, the hundred rivers all flow to the sea—
the hollow must be filled.
The superior person dwells without contention,
relying on softness and weakness.
Though outwardly responding to things, inwardly remains serene.
Walking the Dao like this, ever unobstructed,
step by step, Penglai and Yingzhou.

Three Poems on Awakening from the Southern Branch (Originally titled *Nankezi*)
With Chang Xianzhi

In quiet sitting, the heart is simply at ease;
in secluded dwelling, the mood is admirable."

**Quietly sounding the celestial drum, rinsing cloud buds,**
Breathing in and out in unbroken flow,
Following one’s lot to preserve the livelihood of life.
Simply understanding how to rest in the moment’s course—
Why fret over the changing splendor of things?

The jade paths of Three Mountains are surely not far.
Before departure, for now abide
Amid layered emerald and radiant mist.

---

**To Prefect Liu, Master of Joyful Affairs:**
Apes and birds make true reclusive companions;
Springs and rocks are near neighbors.
Three rods of crimson sun near the gate—
Rising from sleep at ease,
For a time free of cares, briefly drawing close.

The Dark Valley patterns the thousand sages,
The Mud Pill collects the hundred spirits.
With such trifling effort, nurture the celestial true.
Far from harm, preserving life whole—
In pure joy, none surpass you.

---

**At Mingzhou, Delayed by Rain—Detaining a Traveling Friend:**
A carefree wanderer of the white clouds,
No single affair entangles this body.
Idle thoughts drift to rivers and peaks beyond the mountain screen.
Staff in hand, a youth in tow,
Passing through the eastern sea to teach and transform.

The heat’s breath quietly retreats,
Autumn winds distinctly clear.
Unceasing light rain, skies yet unopened.
With intent to detain you,
Not letting you set out the door.

---

**Jade Terrace, First of Three Poems**
**On the Birthday of Master Cui**

The turning of years and seasons,
Now at this time, the tenth month’s minor spring.
The Old Man Star gleams,
Jade cords hang low,
The Silver River arches high.

At dawn, auspicious qi gathers,
Celebrating the banished immortal
Who first alights at the cloud carriage.
By good karmic threads,
Gradually unfolding plain elegance,
Again unfolding the golden lotus.

Soaring free—
Worldly passions swept away,
Mind returning to the root-source of purity and stillness.
Crucible and furnace refine,
The River Chariot transports,
Elixir fills the Three Fields.

Where the cavern chamber shines resplendent,
Tiger and dragon,
Infant and maiden unite in harmony.
Marking long years—
Proud of the tortoise’s span, the crane’s reckoning,
Through kalpas unending.

---

**The Lantern Festival**

The seasons hasten their turn,
Once more the Lantern Festival heralds spring’s return.
The cassia wheel newly full,
Golden lotuses just unfurled,
No need for planting or tending.

Six streets and three markets all aglow,
With turtle-shaped lantern mountains
And pavilions mirrored in radiance.
Vying to join the throng,
Clusters of fragrant carriages and jeweled steeds,
Galloping with abundant talent.

We few...

**The Passions Forgotten**

Passions forgotten, longings stilled—
Within the Crimson Palace’s depths, the immortal embryo is preserved.
Awareness blooms fragrant,
Wisdom’s light shines resplendent,
A joy apart, harmonious and rare.

Jade nectar and ambrosial draughts overflow,
Forming the elixir’s measure—
No less than the finest goblets.
Freely open the heart,
As phoenix and simurgh lead the way,
Feasting and wandering in Penglai’s isles.

---

**On the Birthday of Minister Wu**

Yin at its utmost, yang ascends,
As the pitch pipes respond—
Yellow Bell stands in solemn stillness.
In years past at this time,
Pale clouds trailed their skirts,
Auspicious qi, pure and bright.

The Jade Balance turns in secret,
Revealing the southern arc—
A single luminary grows in splendor.
The immortal minister descends,
Gradually the wind clears Penglai’s gardens,
The moon chills Pengying’s shores.

---

**Majestic.**

Heaven’s talent abundant,
Early years brought fame and success.
Following Heaven, aligning with the Dao,
He withdrew to nurture his vastness—
Peers swallowed their voices.

In his travels, a modest feast,
Friends gathered, goblets crossed like rosy clouds.
Drunk, then sober—
His icy bearing and jade frame proclaimed
A lifespan measured in pine and crane.

---

**Spring Comes from Heaven Above (Two Poems)**
*For Li Zhipu of Shouyang Mountain*

Having awakened to worldly ties,
Shaking off the mountains of favor and seas of love,
The snail’s gain, the fly’s fame—
Joyfully he brushed his sleeves,
Cutting off cares, forgetting passions.
Familiar realms—beware lest they entangle.
Embrace a will unwavering from start to end,
Simply abiding, unquestioning of the path.
Dwelling in non-action,
Enduring the whistling, the scattering,
The still, the clear.

In leisure, he perfected his cultivation,
Refining the hundred vessels to flow freely,
The four limbs at peace.
Tiger crouched afar, dragon coiled,
Qi congealed, spirit concentrated—
A single great elixir, perfectly formed.
Summoning the divine youths to sing and dance,
The cloud chamber filled with jade goblets.
Boundless delight—
Preserving the root, securing the stem,
To gaze long and live forever.

---

**Winter Solstice**

Hare flees, crow hastens,
Racing west to set, east to rise—
The four seasons shift in secret.
The lesser year arrives,
In ten thousand households, a thousand gates,
Laughter and joy celebrate the auspicious day.
Darkly the baleful fate recedes,
As the southern eaves welcome
The sun’s renewed radiance.
Assessing fortune and misfortune,
The silver terrace divines the signs,
The historian’s brush records the clouds.

Oh, vast are the workings of the Mysterious Origin!
Gradually plum blossoms scatter their fragrance,
Railings’ bamboo steals the spring.
The serene one, at ease,
A hundred blessings converge,
Silently nurturing his vastness, preserving the True.
Embodying the wondrous Dao of harmonious emptiness,
Nature governs the turning of chaos.
The year’s labor complete—
The six yin lines exhausted at last,
Pure yang is reestablished.

---

**Remembering Peach Blossom Spring (Four Poems)**
*On Zhao the Marshal’s Attendant Sharing His Rhymes*

A hundred years of life—truly rare.
Who can fathom this truth?
Meeting, we only open our mouths to laugh—
What care for idle sorrows?

The four seasons’ winds and moons are ever fair.
Lay down the heart’s burdens, and all is done.
Though the body may not remain young,
In the end, aging must come.

---

**Again**

Worldly cares and vulgar thoughts—how many?
Who can untangle their far-reaching snares?
Just as we force a smile,
Again they turn to sorrow.

Spring flowers and autumn moons, though fine,
Are all spoiled by the pursuit of fame.
No sooner do we see children grow,
Than our own faces age.

---

**Again**

Few come to Peach Blossom Spring,
Alone he holds the cavern-heaven at dawn’s clarity.
Recalling past follies, he laughs—
Why invite needless entanglements?

Zither and books—his livelihood, perfectly sound.
A single tune in the mountain hall, and all is settled.
Protecting the immortal embryo, ever young,
Forever he follows the Yellow and the Old.

---

**Using the Previous Rhyme, with Hidden Characters**

□ comes—all things in the heart grow few.
□ hidden, heedless of dusk or dawn.
□ silent, forgetting talk and laughter.
□ who grieves over limits?

□ leisure brings ever greater harmony.
After □, before □, the work is done.
□ mending the fading countenance, restoring youth.
□ the immortal knows no age.

**Water Melody (Two Poems)**

The Honorable Zhao’s Copy of a Japanese Poem, Requesting a Response in Its Rhyme

Years fly like arrows,
Greed and desire never cease.
In the western city, spring’s hues first meet,
Then in a blink, autumn startles the eye.
Sun and moon alternate in dawn and dusk,
Silently wearing one old, willingly swept by the flowing waves.
How could it compare to hearing of robust health,
Sleeving the dust to seek reclusion?

Let the heart roam free,
Follow the body’s ease—
Better than enfeoffment as a marquis.
Wandering carefree wherever one goes, unbound,
Utterly like a lone boat.
As long as one’s own nature accords with the Dao,
Let others laugh or err—
Forget shame, forget sorrow.
High-reclining beyond the misty peaks,
Chanting and whistling before the stone tower.

On the Honorable Zhao’s Birthday

Autumn’s hues enter the treetops,
The deep azure sky stretches long.
By the fence, clusters of yellow chrysanthemums,
One after another, exhale their pure fragrance.
Since ancient times, the assembled immortals convene,
Together discussing the rise and fall of the human world,
Aiding the times by responding to the mandate.
Suddenly, the whale-rider is summoned,
Feathered wings descending from the vault of heaven.

Endowed with celestial harmony,
Cherishing trust and kindness,
Devoted and loyal.
Willingly shouldering the weight of office to govern,
Vast magnanimity ever expanding.
Moreover, from the outset, his reputation and worth
Have generously bestowed blessings high and low,
The people’s hopes sheltered in his lingering light.
Offering this ode, wishing the lord longevity,
Forever to secure Anyang.

Four Poems of "Longing for Immortals" (Originally titled "Longing for Each Other")

To Liu Zhichang of Flat Mountain and Liu Zhiben of Divine Mountain

Flat Mountain Liu,
Divine Mountain Liu,
Transforming the common stream into a Daoist current.
Worldly sentiments—swear not to linger.

Awakened steed,
Restrained steed,
Brilliant divine pearl attains freedom,
Radiance ever lingering.

To Li Zhichi of Yanzhou

Li Zhichi,
Engaged in cultivation,
Early tend the heart-field’s thorns and brambles,
Lest the hand act too late.

Draw from the Flowery Pool,
Irrigate the Flowery Pool.
The inferior horse and frantic ape do not gallop—
With merit complete, bow before the jade steps.

To Liu Zhizhen of Pingzhou

Admiring perfection,
Dwelling in perfection,
Every movement and conduct strives for true integrity,
Relying solely on a steadfast will.

Unite with celestial truth,
Harmonize with celestial truth.
Guard the inner truth through the twelve hours,
In every instance, reveal the original truth.

To Song Zhihong of Pingzhou

Escape the cage,
Leave the cage,
Unchanging, unshifting, embracing beginning and end.
Straightaway, manifest your vast resolve.

Accumulate true merit,
Pile true merit.
Truly selfless, merging with the Great Void,
In the crucible, the elixir naturally glows red.

**Cloud-Stepping Shoes** (Originally called "Soft-Turning Shoes")
*Presented to the Daoist nuns of Xuan Zhen Abbey, including Sister Shan, who offered these shoes*

Fortunate to meet the flourishing of the Teaching’s breeze,
Harmonious qi fills my heart.
The pure and true assembly—all are talents of immortality.
With humble reverence, kindness, and obedience,
They earnestly offer **Cloud-Stepping Shoes**.

Skillful hands carve and shape with art,
Pearls and gems adorn the sides.
Each step ascends the altar’s platform.
Awaiting the day when true conduct and merit are complete,
They will transcend the dusty world,
And ascend to Penglai.

---

**Washing the Creek Sands**
*On the Birthday of Daoist Nun Liu*

In mid-summer, the four-petaled lotus first blooms,
A fairy maiden descends in a cloud-borne chariot,
Auspicious light and propitious qi intertwine.

The nature of the Dao is free from worldly dust,
Her spirit unshackled by mundane cares.
Naturally, her longevity rivals Magu’s.

---

**Intoxicated Peach Spring**
*On the Birthday of Zhao Gongshan*

Three days prior was the *Ruibin* solar term,
Her jade carriage parted from the purple palace.
Auspicious mist and blessed haze swirl in abundance,
Together celebrating the birth of this jade-like immortal.

Talented and wise, her nature pure and sincere,
She ever aspires to dwell near the Dao and virtue.
The fleeting scenes of the human world are not worth recounting—
Within her gourd-sky, spring abides anew.

---

**Telling of Innermost Feelings**
*Ascending Yellow Cliff on the Double Ninth*

The Double Ninth arrives once more,
The scenery stark and desolate.
From on high, I give free rein to my emotions, gazing afar,
My eyes traversing the ends of the sky.

Autumn days are short, the frontier sky low,
The wild geese fly south.
Poems inscribed on red leaves,
Wine poured over yellow chrysanthemums—
Without drunkenness, there is no return.

---

**Magnolia Flower Curtain (Three Poems)**
*Mid-Autumn*

Mid-Autumn arrives once more,
The sun sinks, the night grows cool.
Facing misty screens and cloudy veils,
With good friends and kindred spirits,
How boundless our carefree delight!

Suddenly, the jade wheel turns,
Traversing the vast, boundless ocean, leaping the celestial net.
It shatters ten thousand acres of glass,
Illuminating the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

It is fitting
To share fire dates and jade pears,
Opening a pure feast surpassing raised cups.
We indulge our refined aspirations and secluded hearts,
Our distant thoughts and untroubled traces—
All cares forgotten.

I recall the Teaching’s wind first stirring,
Moved by Chongyang’s veiled words hinting at the return of yang.
The fragrance of osmanthus spreads to the nineteenth branch,
Allowing me to first savor its supreme flavor.

---

*In the Rhyme of Master Changchun*

I remember then, my spirit sharp and free,
My passion for the Dao profound, worldly ties sparse.
I loved ancient caves and deep streams,
Where verdant pines and emerald cypresses
Displayed ten thousand scenes.

With a bamboo hat and gourd bowl, I passed the days,
Finding joy in poverty’s leisure—
Its savor surpassing that of fine wine.
Through ages of drunken slumber,
I suddenly awoke, like one who gathers firewood.

---

The **Jade Chart**,
The **Mysterious Registers**—subtle and profound,
I diligently bore them, never failing.
Celebrating the radiance of the numinous,
My heart’s blossoms shone resplendent,
Never withering or decaying.

Wielding the mighty sword of wisdom,
I vanquished the Three Corpses and Six Bandits,
Eradicating the mad throng.
Forever preserving the Embryonic Immortal’s comings and goings,
I traverse the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.

---

Again,

Alas! The bitter sea surges on,
As the deluded masses recklessly drift.
Bound by finite forms,
By boundless love and desire,
They remain imprisoned.

They devise ten thousand schemes in vain,
For in a hundred years,
The fleeting scene does not endure.
Greedily chasing fame and profit,
Who expects rivers to flow far and mountains to stand tall?

---

Like flowing water,
Years and months hasten us along.
It is time to awaken and seek liberation.
Before the Peak of Grand Unity,
Beneath the Twin Trees,
Hasten to gather your heart.

Ever knowing this was wrong,
Yet repeatedly letting go—
Then cease!
With hands unbound, move freely without hindrance,
Like a boat untethered.

---

**Immortal’s Grotto Song (Five Poems)**
*Expressing My Heart*

The Daoist gate delights in stillness, purity, and emptiness,
Free from the disturbances of glory and pride.
At my window at noon, I peruse
The *Dao De Jing* and *Nanhua Jing*,
Beyond these, I idly pluck a tune on my zither.

Autumn’s light has not yet faded,
Silken trees and layered mountains encircle me.
At ease, I take my staff and wander as I please.
Facing the boundless whale-like sea,
My eyes meet lapis lazuli—
Sky and water merge as one.
Why seek to exhaust the profound and subtle?

Awaiting the day when merit is complete and I transform into a flying immortal,
I will traverse mist, waves, and clouds,
Straight to the Isles of Peng.

---

*Instructing Disciples*

In daily cultivation,
Let me once more outline the essentials.
Originally, we abandoned home to attend to our nature and life.
With sincere hearts and bitter resolve,
We tempered sharpness and crushed strength,
Forgetting favor and disgrace,
Naturally attaining spirit’s peace and qi’s stability.

At every turn, on every boundary,
Do not let the monkey and horse play.
At the slightest deviation, correct it.
In leisure, refine
A single grain of golden elixir,
Which, when complete,
Will radiate ten thousand rays of rosy light.

With the Green Dragon and White Tiger as guardians,
Across the Three Realms and Ten Directions,
All will come to celebrate.

---

*Double Ninth*

The wind rises, the dew chills,
Announcing the Double Ninth once more.
After rain, the mountains appear doubly bright and fair.
Crimson leaves clothe the cliffs,
Yellow blossoms line the paths,
Piled like brocade—
Their delicate fragrance lingers as before.

I gaze intently for a long while,
My thoughts entering the realm of nothingness.
Turning my head, I listen to the long stream by the creek.
Reflecting that life is like a dream,
Worldly affairs boundless,
How futile to drown in them—
Better to sweep my sleeves and depart.

Seated on a boulder, my knees at ease,
I forget all schemes,
Watching the drifting clouds at the sky’s edge
Return to the mountain’s embrace.

---

Again,

The pure sky is limpid,
Autumn nears its end.
My aspirations for purity and emptiness rest in the mountains and valleys.
I watch the wild geese in flight,
Forming ranks in the clouds,
Then breaking, trailing southward in their honking passage.

With my true companions, I forget emotions,
Discussing the profoundest mysteries—
Far better than the worldly striving for fame and glory.
Awaiting the joy of dancing sleeves,
Or sleeping in my clothes,
I wholly let go—
What care if the red sun sinks in the west?

In an instant,
I dream of wandering as an immortal.
Awakening, I stroll once more
Through the depths of embroidered screens.

---

*After Completing the Ritual at the Immortal’s Abbey in the Tiger Division Settlement, at the Request of the Assembly*

A realm of immortal wandering,
Where mountains and plains are fair above and below.
Backed by high ridges, facing long streams,
I see peaks arrayed like a thousand blades,
The land embracing the Three Yangs,
Auspicious qi gathering—
Here, the people are honest and kind.

Yellow-haired children and white-haired elders
Have long revered the Dao and honored truth.
Together, they initiated their earnest prayers,
Offering for the withered and decayed.

With caps and robes, they transcribed the petitions,
Invoking the lofty perfected saints,
Who bestowed abundant grace,
Proclaiming amnesty and pardon.

Releasing those on the dark paths,
Ending the bitterness of the suffering,
Ensuring that every household
Shares in blessings and protection.

**"Lament of Wang Zhaojun" – Presented to the Daoist Sisters Xiao Jing Shan and Others**

I urge all who cultivate the immortal truth:
Daily life depends entirely on sincere practice.
Sun and moon race swift as shuttles—
Do not let time slip idly by.

When encountering scenes, let not the heart be stirred;
In sitting, dwelling, moving, abide in stillness.
This alone is the work of mastery,
Aligning with emptiness and nonbeing.
