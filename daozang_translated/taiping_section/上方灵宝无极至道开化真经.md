**Fascicle One of *The Numinous Treasure Supreme Dao of Primordial Transformation Sutra***

**Chapter One: The Sovereign’s Illumination**

The sovereign’s illumination fundamentally lies in governing the people.
Those who govern the people enact lenient governance and bestow benevolence upon them.
*People* refers to the common folk; *govern* means to order; *enact* means to implement; *lenient* means harmonious; *governance* means rectitude.
The daily bestowal of grace and virtue—this speaks of the ruler’s transformation of the people, wherein those who desire peace and order must ensure the sovereign implements lenient governance.
When benevolent grace descends upon them, the Four Seas remain serene; when ritual and music guide them, the cosmos endures in perpetuity.
Thus it is said: those who govern the people enact lenient governance and bestow benevolence upon them.

The *Dong* says:
The people are the qi, blood, and spirit of the human body; they are also the jade chambers and jeweled halls of the body.
To order life and avoid death, one must ensure the primordial spirit enacts harmonious qi and nurtures the qi, blood, and spirit with grace.
When the jade chambers and jeweled halls receive harmonious qi, they naturally transform and give birth to the golden elixir and yellow sprout, wandering freely in the realm of the Great Void and the heavens.

**Eulogy:**
The primordial spirit spreads rectitude to nurture the body’s form,
When the spirit attains primordial harmony, the myriad methods become numinous.
The Dao’s light shines throughout the world without obstruction,
Naturally, the body enters the courtyard of the Great Void.

The destitute are employed,
*Destitute* means distress; *exhausted* means depleted; *then* is a grammatical particle; *employ* means to assist.
The aged and infirm are sheltered,
*Old* refers to the decline of years; *infirm* means the depletion of qi; *shelter* means to nourish.
This speaks of the ruler’s nobility, which lies in assisting the destitute and nourishing the aged and infirm.
Ever approaching them with compassion and love, ever aiding them in their insufficiency—this is the ruler’s true function.

The *Dong* says:
Within the human body reside the Five Spirits.
When dwelling in distress, one must employ the Five Spirits to assist them, thereby restoring life and returning to the root, attaining the principle of rebirth.
The Five Spirits are:
1. The Azure Dragon, the spirit of the numinous youth, skilled in assisting the ethereal soul of Wood.
2. The Vermilion Bird, the spirit of the maiden, skilled in assisting the numinous clarity of Fire.
3. The Yellow Sprout, the spirit of the *wu-ji* (戊巳), skilled in assisting the intent-spirit of Earth.
4. The White Tiger, the spirit of *geng-xin* (庚辛), skilled in assisting the corporeal soul of Metal.
5. The Dark Warrior, the spirit of primordial essence, skilled in assisting the will-spirit of Water.
When the destitute and the aged or infirm return to these Five Spirits and assist and nourish the spirits of the Five Phases, they attain the Dao of longevity.
Why should one journey through distant mountains and vast waters in search of it?
Thus it is said: the destitute are employed, the aged and infirm are sheltered.

**Eulogy:**
One qi revives one treasury of spirit,
When the treasury is depleted, one must replenish the celestial court.
If one nourishes disparate kinds as if of the same root,
In vain is the majestic six-foot body spent.

Descending to those below, they are governed with impartiality.

To govern is to descend. The people are below. Serene harmony is called impartiality. The Zhou declared all equal. To rule is to regulate. To employ ministers is to govern them with balanced rewards and punishments. To employ is to use. Ministers are those who assist and counsel. To increase favor is to reward. To reduce emolument is to punish. Balanced means uniform. Thus, when the ruler governs the people below, he ought to govern them with impartiality. When employing his hundred officials, he ought to govern them with balanced rewards and punishments. If he can do so, the state will be secure without and well-ordered within. Thus, impartiality and balanced rewards and punishments bring uniformity.

The Cavern says: When the primordial spirit governs the body, it is as in the previous chapter. When regulating the various spirits, the hundred vessels, the six palaces and three peaks, the nine chambers and five treasuries, one ought to employ the qi of serene harmony to regulate them. If one spirit is too exuberant, it may be punished and reduced. If one spirit is too weak, it may be rewarded and augmented. If one spirit is tranquil and harmonious, it may be balanced and centered. Thus, by following the Dao of Heaven and emulating the virtue of Earth, one attains the art of nourishing life and is truly esteemed. Therefore, when descending to those below, govern them with serene harmony. When employing the spirits, regulate them with augmentation and reduction to achieve uniformity.

**Eulogy:**
To harmonize qi and pacify spirit lies in augmenting yang,
By observing the Dao of Heaven, one attains prosperity.
Practicing this without negligence incurs no loss,
And one enters the everlasting realm of unending daylight.

To pacify the world, benevolent thought stabilizes it.
To pacify is to secure. The world is the cosmos. To love others and benefit things is called benevolent thought. Benevolent thought is the mind of benevolence dwelling in reflection and contemplation, thereby stabilizing and subduing.

To fortify the world, filial piety and righteousness illuminate it.
To fortify is to strengthen. To repay one’s kin is filial piety. To uphold the center is righteousness. To illuminate is to clarify. Thus, when the ruler secures the world, he ought to employ this mind of benevolence and love, dwelling in reflection and contemplation to subdue the hearts of the world. Desiring to fortify and guard his realm, he ought to employ the virtue of filial piety and righteousness to clarify the hearts of the world. Then he will gain the world’s joyful submission and secure his realm. Thus it is said: from west to east, from south to north, there is no thought that does not submit.

The Cavern says: When one’s primordial spirit desires to secure the body, one ought to employ this mind of benevolence and love, moment by moment, day by day, month by month, year by year, preserving essence, cherishing qi, safeguarding blood, and moistening spirit, loving and benefiting them without the slightest negligence, thereby securing the body. Transforming love to stabilize it, desiring to fortify the body, one internally preserves the qi of primordial harmony and externally supports the moist and lustrous pillar. Not damaging even a thread, this is truly filial piety. One who can do so embodies the Dao of righteousness.

**Eulogy:**
Holding fast to life and destiny, filial piety is the beginning,
The primordial spirit flourishes, and righteousness is no shame.
Illuminating this, not forgetting it even for a moment,
One attains the great vehicle principle of the Golden Heaven.

By employing this Dao, one causes those near and far to rejoice,
To employ is to use. This refers to the Dao explained in previous chapters. To cause is to bring about submission. Those near and far rejoicing means the state is secure and the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace.

Both great and small submit joyfully.
Great and small refer to the honored and the young. Joyful submission means celebrating and coming to court.

August Heaven is moved by goodness and aids him,
Assistance from above.

The divine spirits respond to virtue and protect him,
Heaven and Earth rejoice.

Thus he obtains the dragon countenance and a hundred blessings,
Thus he obtains: that is, he attains. Dragon countenance refers to the appearance of the ruler. Hundred is the general term for numbers. Blessings are longevity, wealth, peace, and harmony; the people submit, the spirits protect, and one is noble until the end of one’s heavenly allotment.

And sagely longevity of ten thousand springs.
Sagely longevity is long years. Ten thousand springs is the utmost of numbers.

Extending to the heir apparent, he is honored as one who faces south, and his rule flows unimpeded as he drapes his robes.
Extending means reaching. *Hu* is a particle. The heir apparent is the ruler’s son. Facing south and being honored is the utmost honor. Draping robes signifies effortless governance. *Fu* is an emphatic negation. Thus, if the ruler can employ this supreme transformation, embodying the adaptable changes of non-action, and follow the great principles of Heaven and Earth, he will gain the joyful submission of distant lands, and great ministers and common people will celebrate and submit. Moreover, he will move the upper realms to assist and support his sageliness, bringing a hundred blessings. Harmonizing with the celestial countenance and longevity, he ascends the imperial throne. Extending to the crown prince, the cycle continues, and he drapes his robes facing south, uniquely honored in non-action, none able to usurp him. How could this not be excellent?

The Cavern says: When one’s primordial spirit employs the Dao of the primordial Dao and its virtue, observing the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth, following the principles of Heaven and Earth, and emulating the Dao in practice, one attains the joy of those near and far. The distant is the head of the celestial court; the near is the bubbling spring of the feet. The myriad spirits come to court at the Jade Capital, thus it is called joy. Great and small submit joyfully: the spirits of the five treasuries and the essences of the six palaces all generate celebration and submit in transformation. August Heaven is moved by goodness and aids him. August Heaven is primordial qi. If one can be thus, then the celestial qi naturally returns to the body. The divine spirits respond to virtue and return to him. The divine spirits are the spirits of the Dao-qi. The spirits of the flourishing Dao naturally come to support the body. Thus one attains the dragon countenance and the realm of a hundred blessings, the head of the dragon countenance. The utmost harmony of the spirits generates a hundred blessings. Sagely longevity of ten thousand springs is the merging of the Dao-body, without end, returning to the root and restoring life, the Dao of long life and enduring vision. Extending to the heir apparent refers to the qi of the infant and elder brother, called the heir apparent. Facing south and being honored means embracing yang in solitary honor and ascending the realm of the Dao. Draping robes and being unable to impede means that I practice non-action and the people naturally transform.

**Eulogy:**
Still able to emulate the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth,
One attains long life on the verdant branch.

The divine radiance at once penetrates the purple gates,
Auspicious clouds naturally bear me homeward.

**Second Eulogy: The Loyal Minister**
To dwell below is to be a minister.
To advance with integrity is loyalty.
Governance is called *zhang*.
Order is called *di*.
Yin and yang are called *er*.
This speaks of the minister’s integrity, which may advance loyalty to the ruler.

**Commentary:**
Essence, blood, qi, flesh, sinews, bones, skin, and hair—these are the ministers within the body.
Only the spirit in the heart dwells in the Crimson Palace, mirroring the ruler’s likeness.
Always ensure that within there is no ruin, and without there is no harm;
Within, augment the qi of profound harmony and vastness;
Without, preserve the luster of supple skin and radiant complexion.
Only thus does one fulfill the Way of the minister serving the ruler.

**Eulogy:**
The organs serve as ministers, the heart as ruler,
Alone in the Crimson Palace, embracing the yang essence.
From distant lands they offer me the cinnabar jade of Heaven,
And I attain the effortless Dao, ever renewed.

The Way of the minister is this:
Loyalty and goodness serve the sovereign.
To die for duty in service to one’s superior is loyalty.
Benevolent love for the people below is goodness.
*Yu* means "in."
The sovereign is the *yuan-shou*.
Virtuous governance orders the people below,
Harmonizing the four seasons and yielding to their decrees.
*Xun* means "to comply."
Spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—
These are the four seasons yielding to Heaven’s command.
Above and below exist in harmony.
The common people find peace in their livelihoods.
*The people* refers to the multitude; *the hundred clans* are the people.
*Jue* means "their"; *sheng* means "livelihood."
The lord secures his state and fortifies it.
His nation stands firm.
Only thus may one occupy the Heavenly Nobility,
And through the generations, how could peril arise?
*You* means "to employ"; *shi* means "this."
To occupy a position is *chu*.
*Yu* means "in."
The *Heavenly Nobility* is the sovereign’s wealth and honor, an unbroken lineage.
*Dai* means "peril."
This speaks of the minister’s Way:
Loyal integrity serves the ruler above,
A good heart governs the people below,
Virtuous governance adjudicates with equity,
Public justice is entrusted to the courts,
And the four seasons are overseen in their proper order.
If one can thus act,
Above and below will naturally exist in harmony,
The common people will naturally live in peace,
The lord will naturally secure his state,
And the Heavenly Nobility will naturally endure.
Employing this Way, how could there be signs of peril or ruin?

**Commentary:**
The human heart and will are the ministers of the Celestial Valley and Mud Pill.
Thus, in the cinnabar loyalty of advancing the Dao,
One penetrates the profound truth,
Cultivates rectitude and repels evil,
And at all times abides in virtue to serve the sovereign spirit of the Celestial Valley.
Again, with virtuous governance and compassion,
One governs the qi of the organs below.
The four seasons are these:
The qi of Wood becomes the human *hun*, called spring.
The qi of Fire becomes the human *shen*, called summer.
The qi of Metal becomes the human *po*, called autumn.
The qi of Water becomes the human *zhi*, called winter.
The qi of Earth becomes the human *yi*, called the four seasons.
If one can regulate these and attain harmony,
Complying with their decrees,
Naturally, above and below will be in profound emptiness,
The body will be at peace,
The primordial spirit will feast in tranquility and long endure.
Only thus may one receive Heaven’s emolument together,
Attain long life without end,
And how could there be signs of peril or ruin?

**Eulogy:**
With luminous clarity, the true nature awakens to serve above,
Wisdom and divine penetration strike down evil obstructions.
Within the crucible, the springs of Heaven and Earth are harmonized,
And one realizes the perfect illumination of the Great Vehicle Treasury.

**Third Eulogy: The Righteous Father**
Yang is honored as the father.
The proper mean is called righteousness.
What the father esteems is the child’s youth—
He cherishes and protects, loving them.
*Shang* means "to value."
The child’s youth means the child’s tender years.
*Yi* means "to cover"; *bao* means "to protect."
To protect and love them is to nurture with a heart of benevolence.
When the child matures,
He entrusts them to a teacher for instruction.
The child’s maturity means their coming of age.
To entrust them to a teacher is to have them study the canons of the former kings.
He guides them with ritual propriety—
*Dao* means "to lead."
Reverent humility is called *li*.
Gentle harmony is called *xun*.
And has them study the sagely texts.
*Xi* means "to learn."
The sagely texts are the writings left by the sages.
When they establish themselves,
He has them advance in their undertakings.
To establish themselves means to become a person of accomplishment.
The moral teachings of the former kings are called the great undertaking.
He admonishes them with sincere instruction—
*Yu* means "to prepare."
When he sees the child’s faults, he first warns them with words.
He has them at all times practice the Way of benevolence—
The laws of the former kings are called the Way of benevolence.
In action and repose, they follow loyalty and trust—
Action and repose mean conduct and stillness.
Sincere intent is called *zhong*; sincere speech is called *xin*.
If they do not comply, only then does he reprove them.
*Fei* means "not."
First admonishing them, if they do not comply, only then does he reprove them.
If reproof is not heeded, then he may punish them.
*Punishment* is called *fa* in legal principle.
To bend the strong and break the rigid,
So that they yield to the moral Way—
Who would not call this a righteous father?
*Qu-qiang* means to subdue the obstinate heart.
*Qu* means "to bend."
*La-gang* means to shatter the violent will.
*La* means "to break."
*Xun* means "to yield."
To bend the strong and break the rigid, making them yield to the moral Way of the former kings—
*Shu* means "who"; *fu* means "not."

"Cloud" means "to say." *Si* means "this." The nobility of a father lies in how he treats his child in youth: he must devote himself to protection and love, nurturing with kindness and generosity. When the child reaches adulthood, he should guide them to a teacher of humaneness. Leading them with ritual and music, instructing them in sacred words, they study the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, the ways of the Zhou and Confucius, and so become a noble person, advancing toward great achievement. If they err, he admonishes them in advance, ensuring their every movement and stillness follows the Way of humaneness, ever employing loyalty and trust. If they do not comply, he reproves them with words. If they still do not obey, he applies legal principle. Bending the strong and breaking the rigid, he makes them yield to the moral Way. If he can do this, who would not say this is the way of a righteous father?

The Cavern says: Water is the father of Wood. Wood is the father of Fire. Fire is the father of Earth. Earth is the father of Metal. Metal is the father of Water. Within the human body, the Metal spirit becomes the White Tiger, the Fire spirit becomes the Vermilion Bird, the Water essence becomes the Dark Warrior, the Earth guardian becomes the Yellow Center, and the Metal elder is the father of primordial *qi*. These are called the Five Venerable Ones. Thus, the Five Venerable Ones can protect the child of Primordial Nothingness and nurture them in youth. When the primordial *qi* matures, it should return to its teacher. The teacher is the office of the lord and spirit. Leading them with ritual and music means Fire’s nature governs ritual and music, born in the heart, corresponding to *Li*. Instructing them in sacred texts means Water’s nature governs will and writing, born in the kidneys, corresponding to *Kan*. *Li* Fire governs ritual and music, *Kan* Water governs literary flourishing. Thus, Fire gives birth to Water within, and Water gives birth to Fire within. When movement and mechanism revolve, Water and Fire ascend and descend, only then is the body of the infant formed. Therefore, when upper and lower harmonize and interpenetrate, the Tiger moves within Water, the Dragon strides within Fire, clouds gather in the yang heavens, and wind arises on the earthly plain. The true immortals of old said: "The Five Phases reverse their guard— the Dragon emerges from within Fire. When the Five Phases do not proceed in order, the Tiger is born within Water." Thus, in every moment, one embodies the image of peace; in every movement and stillness, one follows the virtue of the Way. If there is unruly *qi*, it must be regulated and made compliant. If it is already compliant and dark, it must be harmonized and balanced. Therefore, the unruly are punished, the compliant are rewarded; bending the strong and breaking the rigid to make them yield, one follows the Way to completion and attains virtue. If one can do this, one attains longevity and lasting vision, wandering and feasting through distant years—who would not call this a righteous father?

The Ode says:
When a father nurtures his child, he observes the principles of the Way,
Following heaven’s decree, his subtlety knows no bounds.
Within the mechanism, he grasps the crystal of heaven and earth,
Bright moon and clear wind—nothing compares.

**Chapter Four: The Mother’s Kindness**
To give me life is called "mother"; to assist me is called "kindness." The mother’s way of raising her heir is to hold them in the womb and teach them with ritual. *Xu* means "to nurture." Male and female are called "heir." Pregnancy is called "holding." Teaching them with ritual means that in hearing, movement, observation, conduct, stillness, and sitting—all follows the virtue of the sages and the ritual and music of the former kings. With such prenatal instruction, the child born will be wise, intelligent, worthy, and brilliant in culture. When they are born, she feeds them broth and clothes them with love. *Dan* means "to be born." *Jiang* means "drink." *Si* means "to provide food." Clothing them with love means covering them with garments. She does not harm their form—*wang* means "without," *hui* means "to damage," *jue* means "their," and *xing* means "body." She does not injure their *qi*—"not injuring" means no harm, and "their *qi*" refers to their inner constructive and protective energies. When the heir has grown to maturity, she returns them to humaneness and ensures proper instruction. *Dai* means "when." "The heir has grown" means they have reached adulthood. "Returning them to humaneness" means returning them to a teacher of humaneness. "Ensuring proper instruction" means seeking the teacher’s guidance in the laws of the former kings. If she does not abandon this model, who would not praise her? This is the way of a kind parent. *Fei* means "not." *Shi* means "to abandon." *Si fan* means "this model." *Shu* means "who." *Fu* means "not." *Cheng* means "to praise." The mother’s way of raising her heir is to hold them in the womb and instruct them with ritual. If the heir is born, they will be worthy and brilliant, their form complete. She feeds them broth, provides clothing, does not harm their body, and does not injure their *qi*. When they reach adulthood, she personally ensures they return to a teacher. Instructing them in virtue and the Way, she does not lose this ritual—who would not call her a humane mother?

The Cavern says: The crystal of primordial essence becomes the mother of true blood. The soul of true blood becomes the mother of spirit and intelligence. The spirit of intelligence becomes the mother of flesh and muscle. The essence of the Yellow Center becomes the mother of *po* and *qi*. These five mothers give rise to essence, blood, spirit, flesh, and *qi*. These are called "spirit," hence "mother." The fetal immortal is *qi*, hence "child." The fetal immortal is the child of Primordial Radiance. Always have the mother hold her child and employ ritual. Ritual means preventing the spirit from speaking, hearing, moving, or observing improperly. Thus, guiding the spirit with ritual ensures one does not lose their primordial *qi*. When the fetal immortal matures, it can be watered and clothed. Clothing corresponds to *Zhen*, the soul is called Wood, and Wood gives birth to Fire within. Water corresponds to *Kan*, will is called essence, and essence gives birth to Water within. Water and Fire nourish each other between *Kan* (male) and *Li* (female), forming the radiant cinnabar shape of the Red Dragon. If the human body can cultivate transformation thus, it will not damage its form or injure its *qi*. When the heir is thus nurtured, the inner elixir is naturally refined and ascends to the palace of the primordial spirit between the Celestial Valleys. The palace of the primordial spirit is the abode where teachers of humaneness gather—the spirit within the true is called the teacher.

And the descent of the upright and true *qi* nourishes the multitude of heirs. The ten thousand spirits are called the multitude of heirs—if one does not lose this method, one obtains the foundation of longevity.

The marvel of divine immortals lies in the harmonious ascent and descent. The Three Officials merge as one; the flying dragon soars in the heavens, the wind-borne tiger dwells on earth. Water emerges from the Palace of Fire, and fire is born in the Mansion of Water. The Four Symbols gather in the Yellow Court, the Five Phases unite at the Purple Gate—at this moment, who would not praise it as the wondrous Dao of the compassionate mother?

**Eulogy:**
The Five Mothers nurture the Five Children’s fragrance,
In the end, they never depart from yin and yang.
Grasping the mechanism of the Heavenly Origin’s principle,
One arrives at the Land of Unending Light.

**Chapter Five: Elder Brothers and Companions**
*Kun* means elder brother. *You* means fraternal duty.

For one who is an elder brother to others, it is fitting to act with fraternal duty and deference. *Fu* is an introductory particle meaning "to act." *Ren* refers to the refined union of yin and yang that forms a person. *Kun* means elder brother. *Yi* means "ought." *Ti* means righteousness. *Rang* means humility.

One should employ benevolent reflection. *You* means "to use." Profound kindness is called *ren*. Profound righteousness and deference are called *si*. By acting with fraternal duty and deference, one moves one’s younger brother. By employing benevolent reflection, one illuminates him. *Zhao* means "to clarify."

In relation to one’s younger brother, one naturally fosters joy. *Yu* means "in." *Zhang* refers to the elder. *Ci* refers to the younger. *Zuo* means "to arise." *Ju* means "delight." The abode where the spirit resides is called *bi*.

When their aspirations unite—*zai xin yue zhi* means "in the heart, it is called aspiration"—they serve their parents. If one cultivates this without abandoning it, this is the way of a good elder brother. Practicing this without discarding it is called being a good elder.

In general, one who is an elder brother to others should employ a heart of righteousness, deference, and humility, and manifest the virtues of kindness, fraternal duty, and compliance to enlighten one’s younger brother. The younger brother, naturally moved to joy, will then serve their parents together. If one can cultivate this without neglect, it may be called the virtuous way of an elder brother.

**Insight:**
The small intestine, bladder, and Gate of Life are the elder brothers of the kidneys. The gallbladder is the elder brother of the liver. The large intestine, small intestine, and stomach are the elder brothers of the spleen. The numinous Celestial Valley and primordial essence are the elder brothers of the heart. The harmonious *qi* of *rong* and *wei* is the elder brother of the lungs.

In general, elder brothers are the spirits of the yang palaces, while younger brothers are the *qi* of the yin viscera. If one can observe the principles of heaven and earth, yin and yang, the great and small, the near and far, and grasp the spirits, uniting the two images, transforming disparate bones into kinship, and applying this in daily practice, holding fast to it, one will achieve harmonious ascent and descent, thus perfecting the way of compliance.

Thus it is said: When the state is secure and the people prosper, there is joy and great peace. Fraternal deference is the compliance of *qi*. Benevolent reflection is the ordering of *qi*. Through the compliance of *qi*, one attracts the descent of true lead. Through the ordering of *qi*, one illuminates the subjugation of the true sovereign. Compliance refines the numinous embryo. Clarity draws forth and augments the water and fire. Compliance and union give life; reversal and dissipation bring death. Through death, one returns to life; through life, one seizes death. Following the method of movement and stillness to control it, the foundation of longevity is near.

If one can act thus, in relation to the younger brother of the viscera, one naturally arouses harmonious *qi*. Joy is the expression of harmony. When their aspirations unite—*zhi* is the primordial *qi* of the Kidney Palace—they serve their parents. The father is the primordial foundation of essence. The mother is the ancestral origin of blood. When the yang palaces comply and the yin viscera are ordered, elder and younger brothers harmonize, and parents are at peace. Cultivating and practicing this without the slightest neglect is the mechanism of elder and younger brothers, the way of cultivating life.

**Eulogy:**
To order the household of brothers,
The moon in the celestial pot shines amidst rosy clouds.
Where yin and yang unite in harmony,
Essence and blood transform into cinnabar.
Steadfast through a thousand autumns,
Luminous through seven generations.
In harmony, they return to the one *qi*,
And white hair naturally [fades].

**Chapter Six: Younger Brothers’ Reverence**
*Ci* means younger brother. *Jing* means reverence.

For one who is a younger brother to others, it is fitting to act with reverence. *Yi* means "fitting." *You* means "to employ." One should defer to one’s elder brother, assist him with one’s strength, and filially support one’s parents. *Ye* means "to assist." To serve one’s parents together.

If one’s parents pass away, fraternal duty and deference should not cease. *Zhong* means "to depart." *Ti* means righteousness. *Rang* means compliance. *Wu* means "not." *Qiong* means "to exhaust." Without negligence in this, one may be called filial and fraternal. *Yi* means "to employ."

For one who is a younger brother to others, it is fitting to employ reverence and compliance in serving one’s elder brother, assisting him with one’s strength to serve one’s parents. If one’s parents depart, one should dwell together, practicing righteousness and deference without end, never negligent. If one can act thus, one is filial and fraternal.

**Insight:**
The Crimson Palace’s Red Dragon is the younger brother of the Azure Lad, governing spirit and blood. The Eastern Azure Dragon is the younger brother of the Dark Warrior, governing blood and the hun-soul. The Primordial Palace’s Dark Warrior is the younger brother of the White Tiger, governing essence and will. The Golden Court’s White Tiger is the younger brother of the Yellow Center, governing *qi* and the po-soul. The Central Yellow Center is the younger brother of the Cinnabar Heaven, governing *rong* and *wei*.

Now, the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Cinnabar Lad, Dark Warrior, and Yellow Center correspond to wood, metal, water, fire, and earth, and are the ancestral *qi* of yin within yang and yang within yin. This ancestral *qi* is the One of the Dao. If one can embrace yang and guard the One, one obtains the foundation of longevity and becomes a model for the world.

Thus, the union of yin and yang, the shared chamber of male and female, the state of being without leakage or contrivance—this is the great human principle. Within yin, there is yang, and that yang well assists the yang of *Zhen*. Within yang, there is yin, and that yin well benefits the yin of *Dui*.

Thus, when yin and yang alternate in harmony, the human body attains supreme tranquility. When yin and yang oppose each other, the human body suffers supreme obstruction.

The sagely masters say: Clarity is the source of turbidity. Movement is the foundation of stillness. If one can constantly abide in clarity, heaven and earth will all return to clarity—this is the yang spirit. Turbidity is the yin *qi*. If one can grasp the mechanism of clarity and turbidity, and achieve the transformation of yin and yang, then the realm of heaven and earth’s utmost perfection will all return to reside within the body.

Therefore, the regulation of the hundred bones lies in eating according to the seasons. The peace of the myriad transformations lies in moving their mechanisms. Movement pertains to *qi* and blood—movement engenders life, stillness engenders death. Stillness pertains to the primordial spirit—movement leads to death, stillness leads to life. Thus, whether one’s nature is skillful or clumsy, the ultimate principle lies in this movement and stillness. This is the secret teaching of the former kings, truly the essential point.

For the younger brother among men, one should act with righteousness and follow one’s elder brother, assist the primordial and harmonize their *qi*, and with filial devotion serve the spirits of the Heavenly Valley and Mud Pill. The spirit is akin to kinship. The yang Heavenly Valley is called the father, the yin Primordial Palace is called the mother. The *qi* of yin and yang in harmonious fusion, blending and congealing into purity, gives rise to the spirit—these are the father and mother, the ancestral origin of the Five Phases. When the Five Phases flow in sequence, the Heavenly Valley is at peace; when elder and younger brothers are in conflict, father and mother fall ill.

When illness arises, one should refine yin to nurture yang, and return yang to assist yin. Between yin and yang lies the principle of heaven and earth, mutually nourishing and benefiting—only thus can one long endure. Therefore, the *Yi* says: "The alternation of one yin and one yang is called the Dao."

If father and mother pass away, one should blend and complete the solidity of the Heavenly Valley for the whole of one’s life. Fraternal deference should never be exhausted, for there is no end to following without ceasing. If one can act thus without the slightest negligence, this is called filial piety and fraternal duty—no conduct surpasses this.

The gentleman’s preservation of the body is like the lord and king’s preservation of the state. When the body endures, the Dao endures; when the state is secure, the people are at peace. Those who do not proceed thus—how are they not fools?

In ode it is said:
When elder and younger brothers harmonize, above and below interpenetrate,
The primordial spirit attains the One, flourishing in fragrant midst.
After the spirit womb is threaded through the curtain,
One occupies the first peak of the southern yang.

**Chapter Seven: Filial Devotion of the Child**
To serve one’s parents is called *child*; to repay one’s parents is called *filial piety*.

The foundation of all principles begins with the Way of serving one’s parents. *Principles* here mean the Dao and virtue; *foundation* means beginning; *beginning* means inception. The Way of serving one’s parents is to honor father and mother as the root of the Dao.

When parents are alive, one measures the seasons to clothe them—*measure* means to gauge, *seasons* means times, and *to clothe* is to provide garments. One waits upon the proper times to nourish them—*wait* means to attend, *times* means seasons, and *nourish* means to respectfully provide food. One ensures abundance within the household, never allowing thoughts of sorrow or fear to arise. *Abundance* means fullness; *ensuring abundance within the household* means the home is prosperous. *Never* means without; *allowing* means causing. *Sorrow* means grief; *fear* means dread. One harmonizes relations within the village, never subjecting them to the toils of cold or heat. *Harmonizing within the village* means fostering accord in the neighborhood. *Never* means without. *Never subjecting them to the toils of cold or heat* means ensuring parents enjoy warmth in winter, coolness in summer, and leisure in their dwelling.

If parents err, one may gently admonish and subtly remonstrate. *Parents erring* means they may make mistakes. *May* means should; *gently* means softly; *admonish* means to counsel; *remonstrate* means to advise indirectly. If they do not heed, one may earnestly remonstrate and serve them with loyalty. *Not heeding* means parents may refuse to listen. *Earnestly remonstrate and serve them with loyalty* means to persist in sincere counsel with a devoted heart. Thus, one corrects their faults and fulfills virtue, returning to the yielding path of the Dao. *Returning* means reverting; *yielding* means compliance. *Dao* here refers to the Way of the humane.

If parents fall ill, one attends to them with utmost care—*care* means caution, and *attends* means to soothe. As parents age, one prepares for their needs with reverent vigilance. *Parents aging* refers to their advanced years. *Reverent vigilance* means alternating joy and apprehension, readying oneself to fulfill the rites of filial devotion until the end. When parents pass, one exhausts filial piety in burying them—*parents passing* means their death, and one buries them with a devoted heart. At the appointed seasons, one may honor them with remembrance and sacrifice—*appointed seasons* refer to spring and autumn, when sacrifices are made to recall them with reverence.

One who can uphold this model may return to the Dao. *Can* means to be capable; *uphold* means to serve; *this model* means this standard. As a child, one nourishes parents with clothing and drink, serving them with respect and compliance. One ensures prosperity within the home, never allowing sorrow or dread to trouble their thoughts. One harmonizes with neighbors, never subjecting parents to the hardships of cold or heat. When parents err, one admonishes them; one does not allow them to fall into wrongdoing. In illness, one tends to them; in old age, one attends to them with care and prepares with reverence. At their passing, one buries them with sincerity. At the proper times, one sacrifices and offers to them. One who can act thus returns to the Way of longevity, the essence of meditative concentration, and may be deemed truly good.

It is said: Yin and yang are the children of the Dao. Heaven and earth are the children of yin and yang. Humanity is the child of heaven, earth, yin, and yang. The myriad things are the children of humanity. Humanity nurtures and propagates the myriad things, thus becoming their parent. All who are children must serve their parents with filial devotion to enter the Dao and virtue. By examining the principles of the preceding chapter, one may thoroughly investigate and probe, observing the external to perceive the internal, and the image to perceive the true. What is manifest is form; what is formless is the unmanifest. What is named is the interplay of emptiness and form; what is true emptiness is the constant Dao. Through realization, one attains the primordial foundation. The profound and luminous true master is none other than the person of the Dao.

In ode it is said:
Perceiving the true through images, one entrusts to the real,
Only when the real is whole may the Yellow Court be concealed.
The Nine Springs respond to me without name or surname,
Before the Golden Gates, one must establish proof.
In the vast and obscure, who awakens to understanding?
In the dim and silent, one contracts with the mysterious numen.
Moving the mechanism, one severs the ghost within stillness—
What worry then that soaring clouds may not ascend?

It is also said:
Words may be verbose, but the Dao emerges from the mouth;
The flavor of the Dao is not found in verbose words.
How much more the flavor within the body—
When the heart opens, the mind returns of itself.

It is also said:
A single awakened word spreads broadly,
Yet without clarity, ten thousand scrolls are subtle.
All comes down to this one character—
How bitterly hard it is, east or west!

It is also said:
The Dao is not for the sake of the Dao;
When spoken, it is already in emptiness.
Only when one arrives at the place beyond words
Is the true origin attained.

**Chapter Eight: The Chaste Woman**
Within yin, that which is yang is called *woman*; delighting without excess is called *chastity*. A loyal minister does not serve two lords—a *loyal minister* is a devoted advisor. *Does not* means refusal. *Does not serve two lords* means maintaining allegiance to a benevolent ruler. A virtuous woman does not wed a second husband—a *virtuous woman* is a chaste wife. *Does not wed* means not serving. *Does not wed a second husband* means preserving her chastity. The highest virtue of a woman lies in chastity and valor. What is prized is her valor. The Way of a woman lies in pure conduct. Immaculate integrity is the proper Way of a woman.

In serving her parents and parents-in-law, a woman may advance her filial devotion. *A woman serving her parents* means, while at home, she serves her elders. The parents of her husband are called *parents-in-law*. *May advance her filial devotion* means serving them with filial piety. In serving her husband and his elders and juniors, she may advance her goodness—this means skillfully managing superiors and inferiors. She distances herself from jealousy and envy, guards against improper speech, rejects flattery, and forgets deceitful words. She upholds the principles of conduct. In her own person, she may conceal her chastity—*upholding the principles of conduct in her own person* means preserving the Dao in her heart and maintaining chastity and valor in her body. *Conceal* means to advance; *chastity* means upright conduct in action and rest.

If she does not deviate from chastity and filial devotion, and does not neglect the multitude of good deeds—*deviate* means to stray; *multitude* means many. *Does not neglect the multitude of good deeds* means ever more beautiful conduct—then she may be called a woman of integrity. A loyal minister does not serve two rulers to preserve his loyalty.

A woman of integrity does not remarry, thus preserving her virtue. The most esteemed path for women lies in steadfast purity, unsullied clarity, and the unwavering observance of moral conduct—these should be cultivated within the heart. She serves her elders with filial reverence, governs herself with goodness in relation to her husband, and harmonizes all relationships, whether great or small, near or distant. Only by embodying reverence and propriety, never overstepping humility and deference, rejecting the heart of a flattering woman, and forgetting deceitful speech—only by upholding these manifold virtues without deviation may she truly be called a woman of excellence.

It is said: The *ding* fire is the daughter of *jia* wood, yet it is called the "celestial court’s supreme treasure." The *ji* earth is the daughter of *bing* fire, yet it is called the "cinnabar elixir of numinous efficacy." The *xin* metal is the daughter of *wu* earth, yet it is called the "white tiger’s true essence." The *gui* water is the daughter of *geng* metal, yet it is called the "crimson lead of the watery realm." The *yi* wood is the daughter of *ren* water, yet it is called the "tortoise essence and phoenix marrow." These five are none other than the essential blood, spirit, *qi*, and the interplay of male and female, yin and yang. If one can merge them into oneness and return to the origin, gathering them within the Yellow Court, ascending to surge through the Celestial Valley and Mud Pill Palace above, and descending to flow through the Crimson Palace and Primordial Mansion below—then the Three Origins are nurtured, the Five Viscera harmonized, the luminous nature of vast and radiant spirit is clarified, and the subtle mechanisms of dim obscurity are penetrated. The hundred bones regulate themselves, and the myriad transformations attain tranquility. Spirit becomes numinous, *qi* flourishes, essence abounds, and blood thrives, forming the body of an infant immortal and governing the spirit of the primordial Dao.

Thus, fire emerges from water, and water is born within fire; the dragon soars upon clouds as rain descends across the vast sky, and the tiger roars in the wind as yang rises upon the earth. The spirit attains refinement, the sacred embryo achieves perfection, transcending inquiry yet manifesting in action. It is said: The spirit’s spirit is so because it is spirit; the true’s true is so because it is true. Wondrous awareness mirrors the clear autumn and seals the bright moon; true numinosity illumines the pristine blossom and reveals the river’s flow.

If one can model their aspiration upon this chapter and return to inner illumination—seeking the true image through the illusory, and enacting the inner spirit through the outer—then one may be called a true Daoist. But if, upon hearing righteousness, one cannot change, or upon awakening to the Dao, one cannot comprehend, clinging only to one method without knowing others, how is this different from splitting wood to find jade or drilling ice within stone? Those who apply the true to the true are extraordinary; those who apply the true to the false are fools.

The Dao fundamentally transcends words, yet words are difficult to transform the multitude. Virtue is inherently uncontrived, yet without contrivance, how can one be deluded by methods? Profound indeed is the Dao within humanity—numinous, luminous, awakened, and penetrating, embodying spontaneity. One part of wisdom is the Dao’s first aid; two parts of clarity are the Dao’s second aid. Even to a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or boundless and infinite degrees of luminous wisdom, these are the Dao’s boundless and infinite wondrous aids.

The Dao is inherently inexhaustible, yet the learner’s capacity determines what they receive. If one merely clings to discourse, their toil is in vain. In verse it is said:

Within yin, pure yang aids my excellence,
As curtained light illumines the sky’s rosy clouds.
In the Dipper and Ox Palace, a realm without dust,
Golden lotus steps bloom upon the earth.

And again:

Spring’s beauty rivals the crow’s gloss,
Peach complexion mirrors apricot blossoms.
The river brims with wind and moonlight,
Not confined to imperial domains.
The bamboo grove’s golden-saddled traveler,
The sprout feast’s grassy strands of sand.
The aspirant grasps and abides,
All departing to part the mist and clouds.

Here ends the *Upper Scroll of the Numinous Treasure Supreme Dao of Transformation and Enlightenment*.
*Middle Scroll of the Numinous Treasure Supreme Dao of Transformation and Enlightenment*

**Chapter Nine: The Passing of Zhou**

Zhou means to aid; death means to depart. When virtue and the Dao align with the heavens above, the August Vault of Heaven is surely moved. *Align* means to unite—through virtuous and upright conduct, one joins with the Supreme Emperor.

The root of virtue and the Dao begins with serving one’s parents. Filial piety is the foundation of virtue and the foremost principle of the Dao. When parents pass, one mourns with sincerity, buries them with propriety, and inters them according to ritual. One prays to Heaven and offers sacrifices, establishes merit to deliver them, inscribes spirit-writings and compares them, and presents cinnabar texts to make supplication.

One entreats the Ten Directions of the Cinnabar Heavens to pursue and save them. If one’s devotion is earnest and reverent—like one who respects and prays with utmost sincerity—Heaven will surely respond. *If one’s devotion is earnest and reverent* means to honor and pray with reverence; *Heaven will surely respond* means that the virtue of filial reverence moves the Dao of Heaven to answer.

It bestows blessings and pardons transgressions, sending down grace. *Bestows blessings* means to confer fortune; *pardons transgressions* means to absolve sins. Thus, descendants flourish, and the soul is refined and the spirit tempered for ascension. *Refines the soul and tempers the spirit* means to refine and deliver the hun and po in the Court of Flowing Fire; *ascension* means that, according to the *Prohibited Writings of the Primordial Beginning*, the Red Emperor sponsors them, and they are ranked in the Southern Palace to receive transformation and rebirth.

Thereafter, this extends to kin and strangers, elders and juniors. *Thereafter* means what follows next.

"'*Adai*' means to extend to. *Kin* refers to both inner and outer relatives; *strangers* refers to those who are not of one’s family. *Elders and juniors* means those who are either senior or junior in age. *Far and near, solitary and companionless*—*far and near* means those distant and close. The *white poplar* leads the chant, the *pure wind* relies on its companions, the *bright moon* befriends its neighbors, and *Heaven and Earth* serve as its companions; those who play without dependence are called *solitary*. Those whose bones are unburied, whose wives are as pure as grass and trees, who lie beneath the white dew of the open earth, who by day observe the clouds and rain, and by night gaze upon the stars and the Milky Way, are called *companionless*. These are the ghosts of the *dark passes* without offerings, the souls of the *cold multitudes* without sacrifices—the unvenerated of *Northern Feng*, the forsaken spirits without refuge.

If one can universally arouse a heart of compassion, it will be as before. *Universally arouse a heart of compassion* means to broadly emit goodwill. *It will be as before* means the same as previously stated. Thus, one may *offer deliverance* so that they are born in the *yang realm* and transported to the *wondrous land*. *Deliver their hun and po* and *bury their bones*. *Offer* means to deliver; *deliverance* means to uplift. Let all the unvenerated attain this merit. Such merit moves Heaven to respond, and Heaven answers this virtue. Thereby, one obtains a hundred blessings, sheds a hundred calamities, Heaven extends a hundred fortunes, and one avoids a hundred misfortunes. Blessings extend to the nine generations of ancestors, and the deceased transcend to rebirth. From one’s own person to the attainment of longevity, how could there be an end? *From one’s own person* means oneself; *attainment of longevity* means reaching advanced years. *How* means what; *end* means limit.

The root and beginning of the Dao and virtue lie in serving one’s parents to align with the Supreme Emperor, and in following the methods of the departed. Thereafter, this extends to all souls beneath the *cold springs* and *enduring shadows*—the submerged and stagnant spirits without descendants, the bones scattered like white dew. If one can broadly emit a heart of benevolence, jointly initiate great goodness, deliver and bury them, the merit is immense. The solitary and companionless rejoice, the exposed bones are shrouded, and their forms concealed. Heaven’s heart responds, bestowing a hundred fortunes, and grace extends to the departed ancestors—both the dead and the living benefit.

The *Cavern Scripture* states: To die to the heart and intent is the foundation of long life. To indulge desire and nature is the beginning of early demise. If one can die to the five desires, one attains the Dao of long life, receives a hundred fortunes upon oneself, instantly extinguishes a thousand calamities, accomplishes the supreme Dao, and relieves the nine generations of burdens. One attains longevity to the eyebrows and assists one’s spirit. Spirit and form become wondrous, neither born nor destroyed.

The *Eulogy* says:
To die to desire is to return and attain life,
To give rise to the heart’s intent is the root of death.
Grasping the principle of long life within the mechanism,
Is to be in Heaven yet another Heaven beyond.

**Chapter Ten: Awakening to Life**
*Awakening* means enlightenment. *Life* refers to the Dao of long life. The life of humans lies in awakening to what is right. To awaken to what is right is to live. The death of humans lies in delusion regarding what is right. Not awakening to what is right is to die. What humans *value* is merely wealth. What is prized by humans is material wealth. What humans *love* is merely desire. What humans covet is sensual desire. What humans *contend over* is merely violence. What humans compete for is qi and violence. What humans are *deluded by* is merely wine. What drives humans to madness is wine and sweet liquor. These four thieves reside in humans, confounding them. When all four are present, the human heart is either awakened to what is right or deluded. If one awakens, one accomplishes goodness. *Awakening* is called goodness. If one is deluded, one becomes a minion of evil. *Delusion* is called madness. Those who accomplish goodness attain fortune and flourish. *Goodness* leads to abundant fortune. Those who become minions of evil encounter misfortune and it spreads. *Madness* leads to manifest calamity.

The awakened walk the Dao; the deluded deplete it. Though they enter the same gate, their paths diverge—it lies in the creation of the heart. Awakening and delusion both reside in the human heart, flowing from the same source yet without difference. The extremes of human affairs reach this point. The cause of *this* and *that* does not exceed these four. The four are wealth, qi, wine, and sensuality. The petty person is enlightened by these; the noble person distances himself from them. Thus, when the petty person dwells in wealth, he acts unjustly, harming others to benefit himself. When the noble person handles wealth, he acts with the Dao, harming himself to benefit others. When the petty person dwells in qi, he engages in disputes and transgressions. When the noble person abides in qi, he is gentle and yielding, adapting to all shapes. When the petty person indulges in wine, he gratifies his heart and overturns his form. When the noble person dwells in wine, he nourishes his spirit and cultivates his qi. When the petty person indulges in sensuality, he harms his nature and injures his life. When the noble person abides in sensuality, he attains freedom from leakage and non-action.

What is called the Dao for one is called depletion for the other. These four flow ceaselessly, day and night. Whether one becomes an immortal or descends to a ghost—how profound is the difference? It lies in the human heart.

The *Cavern Scripture* states: Wealth is the head of immortals, and it skillfully trades in the *yellow sprout*. Sensuality is the foundation of immortals, and it skillfully benefits movement and stillness. Wine is the nectar of immortals, and it skillfully aids primordial qi. Qi is the root of immortals, and it skillfully governs ascension. These four—when the benevolent see them, they call them benevolence; when the wise see them, they call them wisdom. Though their streams diverge, their source is one, originally divided yet the same.

Thus it is said: The noble person, upon obtaining them, remains steadfast in poverty; the petty person, upon obtaining them, forfeits his life.

The *Eulogy* says:
Wealth, qi, wine, and sensuality—all arise from the heart,
The petty, without cause, invite deep misfortune.
Only the great noble person’s use of them
Transforms them all into a body of purple gold.

**Chapter Eleven: The Master’s Teachings**
To transmit what is right is called a *master*. To teach what is right is called *instruction*. There is none who attains the name of noble person who does not emerge from a master. *Attains the name of noble person* means to achieve a fine reputation. *None* means without; *emerge* means to come forth. *There is none who does not emerge from a master* means that none achieve great renown without a master. The reason the master is esteemed lies in the teaching of what is right."

The particle *zhu* (诸) means "these" or "them." The reason the master is esteemed lies in *rightness* (正). Now, *rightness* means aligning with Heaven and honoring the law. August Heaven shows no partiality, aiding only those who possess *virtue*—for *virtue* is none other than *rightness*. The Three Hundred Poems of the *Book of Songs* all embody the thought of "no depravity," for poetry serves as a model. To disseminate right teaching is like the harmonious wind. *Disseminate* means to spread; *Dao* and *virtue* are called *rightness*; *like* means "as if." The spring breeze is called the *harmonious wind*, for it nourishes the myriad things. When the master imparts right teaching, the disciple gazes upon and practices it. The master’s instruction is right teaching, and the disciple carries it out. The transforming power of the wind’s harmony is like grass bending to follow it. The wind passing over grass must cause it to bow. As for disciples who are good, instruct them with a sincere heart. *Instruct* means to teach. For good disciples, teach them loyalty and goodness. As for disciples who are not good, guide them with loyalty and forbearance, then withdraw. *Withdraw* means to retreat. For unworthy disciples, first teach them with loyalty; if they refuse to follow, show forbearance and step back. If one can act thus, only then may one be called a teacher of others. Conduct and concealment in this manner may be called a *benevolent master*. Failing this, one is but a man of fallen weeds and jagged stones—*fallen* like withered grass, *jagged* like rough stone. Such a reckless person is called a *base man*. To mislead others is to plant the roots of deep calamity.

When the master imparts rightness, the Way of Heaven follows in accord. Thus, the Way of Heaven constantly aids virtue and aligns with rightness. The Way of *right virtue* may be taught to others; the way of *non-right virtue* may not be taught to others. To instruct with *right virtue* is like the advent of the spring’s harmonious wind. When the harmonious wind arrives, the myriad things follow and attain their life. When right teaching descends, disciples practice and perfect their virtue. Yet the master’s rightness must lie in discernment: assess the vessel’s weight, rank, and capacity, then teach according to its measure. If one of middling capacity or above is taught with the methods for those below the middle, the person is lost. If one below the middle is taught with the methods for those above, the words are wasted. Thus, for good disciples, instruct them with a sincere heart; for unworthy disciples, guide them with loyalty and forbearance, then withdraw. Only those who can act thus embody the true form of a master. Failing this, one is but an empty, hollow pretender. Not only does one mislead others, but one also treads the path of unrighteousness—no shallow error indeed.

The *Dong* says: The body of the Dao is emptiness and void, profound and unfathomable. Without a master’s instruction, none can attain it. Yet by accumulating benevolence, filial piety, loyalty, and rightness, benefiting others and cherishing people, one’s virtue aligns with August Heaven, and one naturally encounters a true master.

The *Eulogy* says:
Right transformation is like grass bending to the wind,
Dwelling in goodness, they naturally return to loyalty.
Who shall inquire of me the matters of white and colored silk?
Dyed in blue or yellow, the hues differ in response.

**Chapter Twelve: The Disciple’s Learning**
A *disciple* is one who is another’s younger brother or another’s child. *Learning* means awakening and enlightenment. The disciple’s first task in practice is to select good virtues and embrace them. *The disciple’s first task in practice* refers to the beginning of study. *To select good virtues and embrace them* means to follow a benevolent master and learn right virtue. Reject non-virtuous ways and distance oneself from them, avoiding their harm. Begin with yielding to good virtue, and ultimately accomplish virtuous deeds. *Begin with yielding to good virtue* means to take compliance with the Dao as the first step. *Ultimately accomplish virtuous deeds* means to perfect virtue as the goal. In action and stillness, one reaches the Dao; in conduct and concealment, one employs the Dao of benevolence. In seeing and hearing, one abides in virtue. Observe and listen with the virtue of benevolence. Be loyal, filial, trustworthy, and diligent, never idle in heart. Serve one’s lord with integrity—this is called *loyalty*. Serve one’s parents with propriety—this is called *filial piety*. Words and deeds in accord—this is called *trustworthiness*. Diligence without sloth, reverence in public affairs—this is called *diligence*. *Never idle in heart* means never allowing one’s resolve to waver. Cultivate literary thought, propriety, and yielding, never forgetting one’s aspirations. *Literary thought* comprises five classics: first, the *Book of Changes* in the *Zhou Documents* and the *Book of Documents*; second, the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Rites*, and *Book of Music*; third, the *Dao De Jing*, *Yin Fu Jing*, *Su Wen*, and *Nan Jing*; fourth, the *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras*; fifth, the Confucian classics and canons. These five classics must never be neglected in thought. *Thought* arises from intention, and intention resides in the spleen and stomach. The nature of thought and intention is prone to depravity and covetous desire. By constantly teaching these five classics, one nurtures benevolent nature and returns to the realm of the Dao.

Some say: "To have no mind is the Dao"—this is not to be spoken. Without sagely instruction, the mind becomes like a monkey’s intent; without literary teaching, it becomes like a horse. The nature of monkeys and horses is akin to ignorance. Through learning and awakening, one first attains the *mind of Dao*. Only at this stage may one cease learning—how could one simply have no mind and call it the Dao? Thus, learning begins with literary thought and sagely words, profound and ever more profound.

To walk the middle path is called *propriety*. To yield to righteousness and harmonize with others is called *yielding*. *Never forgetting one’s aspirations* means never abandoning these four in one’s thoughts. If one can act thus, one may be called a *learner*.

The disciple’s beginning in learning must be to choose a benevolent master and follow them, studying the right classics of the former kings. As for non-benevolent masters, one may distance and separate from them. Following a benevolent master, good virtues gradually renew—thus it is the beginning. Perfecting good virtues completes the great enterprise—thus it is the end. In words heard and actions observed, do nothing that is not of the Dao and virtue. In dwelling, walking, sitting, and resting, do nothing that is not good and right. In literary thought, propriety, and yielding, do nothing outside these. In loyalty, filial piety, trustworthiness, and diligence, employ nothing else. Keep these in mind at all times, and let conduct and concealment preserve one’s aspirations. If one can act thus, one may be called a *learner*.

The *Dong* says: Floating life is like a dream—all is empty.

Having fortunately attained a human body, one should study the Dao and virtue. How could one do otherwise, and thus sink into eternal oblivion? A verse says:

The crow chooses a forest fit to nest its feet—
How can a human, at peace, not learn transformative teachings?
One must know the former kings’ instructions of old:
"Review the past to know the new," daily polishing one’s mirror.

**Chapter Thirteen: Benevolence and Righteousness**
To benefit life and deliver from death is called *benevolence*.
To put others before oneself is called *righteousness*.
How revered are the sagely ones—what they esteem is nothing but benevolence and righteousness.
Alas, the sagely ones uphold benevolence and righteousness!

Now, *benevolence* is the beginning of harmony, accord, non-opposition, love for others, and benefit to all things—its practice extends outward.
"Harmony, accord, non-opposition" is yielding.
"Love for others, benefit to all things" is compassion.
"That which is practiced and extends outward" refers to conduct beyond the self.

*Righteousness* is the embodiment of unceasing good virtue, the mean, appropriateness, constancy, and reason—its practice resides within.
"The mean" is the middle way, without excess or deficiency.
"Appropriateness" is measuring one’s capacity and acting accordingly in advance or retreat.
"Constancy" is the unchanging norm.
Though these two differ when separated, they are the same when merged.
The great Dao has unity: different paths lead to the same destination.
Practiced from beginning to end, how could one ever be in peril?
"Beginning" is the start; "end" is the finish.
"How" means "why"; "peril" means danger.
How solemn! What the sagely ones value is benevolence and righteousness.

When benevolence fills the human heart, it brings benefit to life and deliverance from death.
"Benefiting life" means reducing punishments, employing expedient kindness and forbearance toward others, and demanding strictness of oneself.
It is the way of perfecting others, fulfilling their virtue, ensuring their peaceful existence, guiding them away from evil, and transforming them to return to Heaven.
It is illuminating the earth, examining the state, honoring the ruler, personally teaching people the principles of nature and destiny, restoring the root and returning to the origin—this is what is called the way of benefiting life.

"Delivering from death" means aiding those in peril and distress, rescuing from disaster and calamity.
It is pulling all beings from suffering and saving their lives.
It is offering sacrifices to forgotten spirits and covering those without rites.
It is delivering both kin and strangers, pursuing both enmity and affection.
It is putting others first and oneself last.
It is providing from one’s surplus to assist those in need.
It is revealing the human way and concealing one’s own brilliance—this is what is called the way of delivering from death.

Thus, the sagely ones esteem this benevolence and righteousness, and what they uphold in benevolence and righteousness is harmony, yielding, the mean, and appropriateness.
Benevolence is like a person’s head.
Righteousness is like a person’s feet.
Harmony, yielding, the mean, and appropriateness are like a person’s four limbs.
When complete, they form the whole body; when deficient, they cause illness.
The arising of illness is close to the path of death.
Thus, only by preserving the whole form can the Dao be fulfilled.

Now, *harmony* is loving others and benefiting all things.
*Yielding* is blending with the world and following all things.
*The mean* is the constant Dao and propriety toward all things.
*Appropriateness* is handling affairs in accord with all things.
These four, together with benevolence and righteousness, share the same source but flow in different streams, ultimately without distinction.
The key lies in practice and concealment, treading and applying them, embodying and enacting them—how could there be peril or danger?
Thus, the sagely ones say: "Be as careful at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failure."
A verse says:
To love the spirit is called *benevolence*; to augment *qi* is called *righteousness*.
The way of benevolence and righteousness can embrace death—how could it ever be destroyed?
Thus, the way of the enlightened king is vast indeed.

A verse says:
Benefiting life and delivering from death align with the lofty and bright;
Putting others first and oneself last, ever employing balance.
One day, when merit is complete, the Heavenly Emperor will summon—
Why need one ride the cloud carriage to the Eastern Capital?

**Chapter Fourteen: Gentleness and Harmony**
Gentleness overcomes rigidity.
Harmony unites a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions, naturally achieving perfection.
How excellent! What the sagely ones constantly value is the preciousness of gentleness and harmony.

Gentleness is not violent—
"Violence" is contention.
Harmony is not contemptuous—
"Contempt" is disdain.
Preserving gentleness leads to longevity—
Gentleness and harmony are the companions of life.
Rejecting violence and contempt ensures enduring existence.
Be respectful toward others without fault, and deferential toward others with propriety.
The conduct of one who embodies gentleness and harmony is like the southeast lands that are good at humility.
"Like" means "as."
The southeast is the land of rivers and seas.
The land that is good at humility draws all the waters of the world to return to it.
The greatest should be humble, and the world will return to it.
The person who embodies gentleness and harmony moves the hearts of the world to delight in them.
The noble person honors the worthy and accommodates the multitude, praises the good, and pities the incapable—people respond in kind.
When waters return, rivers and seas grow ever more abundant—
"Grow" means increase.
When people delight, the myriad transformations become ever more peaceful.
Though these two differ in form, their function is the same.
People and water differ, yet their Dao is without distinction.
Those who can be thus tread the path of the sagely ones and enter their chamber.
"Tread" means to walk.
Those who can be thus ascend the hall and enter the chamber.
Is this not excellence in governance?
"This" refers to the present.
"Excellence in governance" is the excellent Dao.
"Is this not excellence?" means "how excellent!"
What the sagely ones constantly value as foremost is the application of gentleness and harmony.
Through gentleness and harmony, one eliminates the faults of violence and contempt; once violence and contempt are gone, respect and yielding arise.
"Respect" is respecting others so that others return respect to oneself.
"Yielding" is yielding to others so that others return yielding to oneself.
Thus, the former kings rejected violence and contempt and preserved gentleness and harmony; employing these is like the virtue of the southeast’s deep lakes and rivers, the waves washing into the seas.
Their virtue is good at humility, so all the waters of the world return to them, becoming ever more abundant and inexhaustible.
Applying this to people is likewise.
This Dao is most precious, enduring through a thousand autumns and ten thousand ages, long-lasting and ever-present, without destruction—excellent beyond excellence, mysterious beyond mystery.
A verse says:
The *qi* of the celestial pot:
Gentle and harmonious, it leads to long life and feathered transcendence;
Rigid and strong, it brings illness, calamity, and sinking into oblivion.

What they call "orthodox" is what we call "heterodox." What issues from you returns to you.

A verse says:
The humane show respect to others,
And others return respect in kind.
The righteous show deference to others,
And others likewise follow righteousness.
Reciprocal virtue flows between them,
Concealment and display in balanced love.
How great was the transformation of the former sages—
All under heaven came as guests.

**Chapter Fifteen: Establishing Teachings**
To establish (*she*) is to set up; teaching (*jiao*) is to rectify and transform. Those who establish teachings expound orthodoxy and transmit orthodoxy. Those who establish teachings are the noble ones who set transformation in motion for others. The deluded may claim this scripture traces its origins to the texts of the *Zhou Shu*, Laozi, and Confucius, yet it is not a scripture of their own making. To transmit orthodoxy is to illuminate the customs of the world and rectify them. To illuminate (*zhao*) is to make clear. Once the orthodox teaching is transmitted, all under heaven naturally submits. To transmit a teaching that is not orthodox is to transform the customs of the world into something likewise unorthodox. If the teaching is not orthodox, all under heaven naturally falls into chaos. When customs and transformation are orthodox, Heaven and Earth align with them. When customs and transformation are unorthodox, yin and yang rebel against them. Alignment brings prosperity; rebellion brings adversity. The beginning of adversity or prosperity lies in teaching. Orthodoxy and heterodoxy receive their due from Heaven in this way.

In ancient times, when the sages transmitted orthodox teachings, the Dao of Heaven aided them, and the divine spirits assisted them. To aid (*fu*) is to support. Those who uphold orthodoxy receive the aid of the Dao of Heaven, the protection of the divine spirits, and are enabled to endure. Those who do not follow orthodox teachings incur the wrath of the Supreme Emperor and the punishment of the Earth Sovereign. *Bei* (奰) is pronounced as in *pingyi*. *You* (由) means "to follow." The Supreme Emperor is the Heavenly August Emperor. *Bei* means anger that presses upon one. "The Earth Sovereign punishes them" refers to the Earth Lord’s execution. The response to teachings—whether orthodox or not—is thus. How could those who transmit orthodoxy to others fail to be cautious?

Those who transmit teachings to others govern all under heaven—how could they not be prudent? To be imprudent is to lack reverence and care. In ancient times, enlightened kings transformed all under heaven through orthodoxy, governing with policies that brought the myriad people into submission. Thus, Heaven and humanity aligned with them, yin and yang harmonized with them, the primordial Dao aided them, and the divine spirits protected them. If governance were otherwise, the opposite would occur. The retribution for orthodoxy or its absence is thus. How could those who bring life to the world fail to be cautious?

A verse says:
The *Dao* of the primordial and unified divine:
Orthodoxy ensures long life and enduring vision;
Heterodoxy brings the calamities of the three paths and five sufferings,
Sinking into oblivion—how could one ascend to the realm of heavenly beings?

**Chapter Sixteen: Delivering People**
To encounter beings and benefit life is called *deliverance* (*du*). The Dao of delivering people is the essence of the sage. This essence is none other than virtuous power. To put others before oneself is called *goodness*. To place others first and oneself last. When Heaven aids the Dao, it is called *virtue*. The Dao of Heaven is impartial and constantly aids the good. August Heaven is without partiality and only aids those with virtue. Those who can do this are truly called *Perfected Ones*. *Cheng* (诚) means "sincere." The Perfected One is one of true virtue and Dao. Those who cannot are called *petty persons*. Otherwise, they are petty persons.

The Perfected One can deliver others; the petty person cannot. The noble one benefits others; the petty person harms them. Those who deliver others must think and act with caution. To encounter beings, benefit life, and deliver people is the essence of the sage’s Dao. This essence is virtuous power. The highest virtuous power places others first and oneself last. If one can truly do this, one obtains the joy of Heaven and humanity, the protection of the divine spirits, and the aid of the lofty heavens—this is called *virtue*. Having such virtue, one is truly a Perfected One. Only as a Perfected One can one encounter beings. Otherwise, one is a petty person. Those who lack virtue, being of lowly rank, can only harm beings and thus cannot deliver others. If they attempt to deliver others, they will fall into the realm of unrighteousness, incurring eternal grievances across a thousand autumns and ten thousand ages, with no hope of escape. Therefore, those who deliver life and benefit beings are truly called Perfected Ones.

A verse says:
Those who master the secret and profound,
Who deeply comprehend the subtle and formless,
Who know the divine and grasp destiny,
And to whom all things return—
They can deliver the immortal embryo,
The kind, the taught, the loyal, and the good.
Those who are not like this should be cautious.

A verse says:
In every place, majestic and secure,
Bright and dim, present in every moment.
The fragrant sprouts of the Jade Pool bloom,
Golden lotuses step by step, blossom by blossom follow.
The *Upper Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Dao of Transformation* concludes here.

**Chapter Seventeen: Human Relationships**
Heaven and Earth’s essence coalesces to form humanity. When virtue and the Dao are complete, this is called *human relationships* (*lun*). The host employs the guest, and this is called *illumination* (*ming*). The host guides the guest to follow the Dao, and this is illumination. Illumination is the Dao of simplicity. Simplicity (*su*) means to appear plain and embrace the uncarved, without selfishness or desire. Do not labor the body or disturb the essence. Empty the mind to embody the Dao of Heaven; fill the belly to emulate the virtue of Earth. Those who can do this are truly illuminated.

A verse says:
True constancy, steadfast and wondrously boundless,
A person stills like a river at dusk, reeds along the bank.
In a lone hut by bamboo fences and thatched eaves,
The clear wind and bright moon illuminate pear blossoms.

When the guest moves the host, this is called *confusion* (*hun*). When the guest moves the host, acting contrary to the Dao, this is confusion. When semblances merge and solidify, this is called *authenticity* (*zhen*). When forms blend and things become firm, this is authenticity. When vessels are damaged together, this is called *punishment* (*xing*).

When the same vessel suffers harm both within and without, this is called *severe punishment and ruthless killing*. When ingress and egress are complete, this is called *spirit*. When ingress and egress do not lose the Dao and the spirit within remains whole, this is spirit. When movement and stillness hit the mark, this is called *clarity*. When movement and stillness stand at the center of the Dao, this is the root of clarity and stillness. When the great image is cool, this is called *tranquility*. When the great image is solid and fire blazes, only by cooling it can tranquility be achieved. When the Great Void flames, this is called *fullness*. When the Great Void has lost its form and the blazing fire increases, it may become full. When dwelling in harmony and emptiness, this is called *balance*. When one abides within the spirit and qi, using harmony and emptiness to balance them, the spirit dwells in intervals. This root employs luminous clarity to awaken it.

Following the seasons to conserve is called *clarity*. To conserve is to nurture. Following the signs of the four seasons, one feeds beneficial things. Regularly consuming foods imbued with qi, yang fluids assist the body’s shell, while yin waters repel them. Using the turbid to restore the turbid, the foul to supplement the foul, one nurtures the spirit, then draws upon the true yang essence of the *li* fire to refine it. The method follows the time between *chou* and *yin* hours, the day within one *hou*. Two hexagrams make a year, two crescents make a month. Closing the seven orifices, lying back to retract the spine and draw in the navel, the nose draws in pure qi. □ enters the primordial palace; once the qi is settled, then expel the turbid qi. Practicing this gradually completes the true Dao. Thus it is said: eating in season, the hundred bones are ordered; moving the mechanism, the ten thousand transformations are at peace.

A verse says:
To order the fragrant grotto-heaven,
Nurture the root and stem to flourish.
In the new moon, tend the bamboo;
Plum blossoms brave the snow’s fragrance.
The turbid body, once cleansed, regains its elegance;
The flowing source, when stilled, reveals its brilliance.
Vast the *li* yang’s pattern,
Able to join with the *kan* qi’s firmness.
Eating in season, warmth is not discarded;
Moving with the time, fire suffers no harm.
Nurturing the body that soars through the clouds,
Limpid, the great Dao’s homeland.

Another verse says:
By jade streams and immortal caves, a rustic’s home,
Dawn’s light, clear mist, distant sands.
Faintly by the water’s edge, flowing into the door—
All was but a stretch of peach blossoms.

Another verse says:
To settle the spirit and preserve life lies in non-labor;
Few desires, no selfishness, the body naturally thrives.
Each time, at mealtimes, nurture externally;
Within the grotto-heaven, the *li* fire refines into □.

Skillful transformation is called *numinous*. Dwelling in action yet non-action, skillfully transforming and numinously clear. Modeling the heavenly Dao is called *completion*. Grasping and observing the heavenly Dao, moving the mechanisms within and without, one immediately achieves growth, completion, and perpetual spring without night. Thus the scripture says: The Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The high is pressed down, the low is lifted up. The excessive is reduced, the deficient is supplemented. The human Dao is not so—it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can reduce the excessive to serve the deficient throughout the world? Only the true Daoist. If one can model this Dao of Heaven, one completes the body of the immortal and sage.

Those who persist in this are called *paragons of humanity*. *Persist* means ability; *in this* means thus. Completion in the wondrous Dao. Those who lack this ability—how can they avoid sinking? *Lack* means without; *by* means using. Those without this ability do not employ it. *How* means why; *sinking* means drowning.

Alas! Joy and ruin lie here—
Wandering, what have you heard?
*Alas* marks the bitter path; *joy* is the immortal’s Dao. *Here* is a particle; *ruin* is the foundation of death; *lies* is the beginning of life. *Wandering* refers to the path of bitter and joyful, life and death. What you have heard are the meanings of the chapters transmitted to the ear.

The *Dong* says: The spirit is the master—it is the inherently awakened nature of the human heart. Qi is the guest—it is the harmonious qi of the kidneys. The heart is the lord; the intent is the guest. Always let the spirit command the qi, the heart command the intent, and one attains harmony and peace. If not, the opposite will occur. Thus it is said: The heart commanding qi is strength; the master discarding the guest is clarity.

If one can be thus, one unites with forms to attain solidity, joins in action to avoid punishment. Naturally, one completes the spirit in ingress and egress, hits the mark in movement and stillness. If yang is too fiery, cool it with water. If the Great Void is too cold, warm it with fire. If dwelling in harmony and emptiness, balance it with the true. If abiding in the four seasons, nurture and cultivate it. If one can persist in this, transforming and skillfully adapting, modeling the heavenly Dao, the wondrous Dao is thereby completed.

Once the wisdom-nature opens, it expands into the vast, clear, and empty realm. Primordial luminosity shines forth, penetrating the root of heaven and earth. Seeing through action and form as fleeting as dreams and lightning, awakening to the formless merging with the imageless as true emptiness—thus transformation is unfathomably numinous. Fortune and misfortune do not measure its vessel; it steps beyond the shore of life and death, departs the realm of suffering and joy, roams the great kalpas in eternal existence, and treads the wondrous realm of the Yellow Flower.

A verse says:
To transcend the world, rely on the supreme text;
Within the chapter on human paragons, the true is revealed.
If one can fully practice this,
One is a supreme adept of the Primordial Origin.

**Chapter Eighteen: Resonance and Response**

Resonance and response are cause and effect. The Dao of resonance and response arises from the mutuality of heaven and humanity. When humans act, heaven responds—thus heaven and humanity communicate. What humans emit elicits a response, like the echo in a valley. Empty valleys return words with resonant sounds. Human good and evil bring fortune and misfortune in their wake. What humans create evokes retribution, like a shadow following the body. Crooked or straight forms cast corresponding shadows. Good and evil manifest their retribution—cause and effect are fixed.

The Dao of Heaven aids the good and assists virtue. Heaven’s net is vast, far-reaching, and without limit. The heavenly Dao is impartial, only favoring the good, aiding virtue, supporting the loyal, protecting the good, nourishing filial piety, and benefiting the worthy. Its mirror is natural—illuminating the world like the autumn moon reflected in river waters.

The arbiter of good and evil presides over the world like a precious mirror facing all forms. How majestic! How luminous! *Huang* means great; *zhao* means bright. Lofty yet without fixed position, vast yet without limit, its brilliance boundless—thus the double emphasis. Those who follow it receive a hundred blessings: those who do good, August Heaven bestows fortune. Those who do evil, the solid earth brings calamity. Those who defy it receive a hundred misfortunes. Deceiving superiors and exploiting the people, August Heaven will not protect. Harming benevolence and righteousness, Heaven visits you with misfortune. Behold the workings of stimulus and response—how vast and manifest! *Shi* means to make clear. "Behold the workings of stimulus and response" refers to the luminous retribution of cause and effect. *Hao* means Heaven; *ju* means great. "Vast and manifest" signifies Heaven’s great clarity, inscribed across past and present.

Alas, humanity—ought they not be cautious and deliberate? O people, ponder and stand in awe. The *Dong* says: "To revere the Mandate of Heaven is the fragrant teaching of rulers. To observe the Dao of Heaven is the model of immortals and sages. Follow it and act, and you shall flourish; oppose it and employ it, and you shall perish." Thus the sage accumulates virtue to align with Heaven, uniting spirit with the Dao to attain the Way of long life and enduring vision. Those who do not proceed thus are truly the height of folly.

**Eulogy:**
Retribution shines like the autumn Han moon,
Its radiance mirrored in clear river waters.
Impartial and uncrooked, earth and Heaven illumine—
In the human world, all ponder the great divine wisdom.

**Chapter Nineteen: Advancing and Retreating**
Act and withdraw in accord with rightness.
In movement and stillness, observe Heaven.
Those who embody the Dao, virtue, and goodness may be clearly advanced.
Those who lack the Dao, virtue, and goodness may be decisively withdrawn.

Where the Dao of Heaven moves, one may proceed.
Where the Dao of Heaven moves, one may halt.
Those who can advance with clarity are called *zhenren*—true persons.
The practice of the true person is what is meant by "knowing contentment and delighting in Heaven, frugality, restraint, magnanimity, and compassion."

Knowing contentment, neither wealth nor nobility can surpass.
Delighting in Heaven, love and entanglements cannot reach.
Frugality and restraint keep insufficiency at bay.
Magnanimity and compassion keep calamity and harm afar.
These four virtues are like the four limbs of the body—their use is essential.

Those who can decisively withdraw also preserve themselves as the true person’s embodiment, thus enacting the true person’s practice. Those who can decisively withdraw are likewise called true persons. The constancy of the true person lies in yielding to the times, aligning with the great, balancing goodness, and illuminating the spirit.

Yielding to the times averts harm;
Aligning with Heaven draws near to fortune;
Balancing goodness leads one into the Dao;
Illuminating the spirit lifts one beyond the world.
This is what is meant by preserving wholeness as a true person, while neglecting it makes one a petty person.

If one can discern and decide when to advance or retreat, near or far, only then may one approach the real and draw near to sageliness. When a person can advance or retreat, discerning near and far, employing this principle, one may enter the real, approach the realm of sages, and enter the chamber of sages.

The *Dong* says: "Preserving the body requires bending without straightening. Achieving renown requires straightening without bending. Cultivating the self demands expending fame and wealth. Pursuing fame and wealth violates self-cultivation. The former cannot do the latter; the latter cannot do the former. Only the true person can make the former serve the latter and the latter serve the former."

Thus the sage says: "The skilled merchant conceals his treasures as if empty; the person of abundant virtue appears foolish. Straight yet not unrestrained, radiant yet not dazzling—profound and ever more profound, this is the wondrous teaching of the First Master."

**Eulogy:**
The Dao and virtue of former kings, rites and music resplendent—
Employ them in due time, and earth and Heaven open wide.
Without these, how can one escape the dream of floating life?
By the willow bank, the moon’s *qi* lingers in vain.

**Chapter Twenty: Following the Three Teachings of the Sages**

**Chapter Twenty: Following the Three Teachings of the Sages**

The fundamental stream flows without distinction. Those who study and attain nobility—we know they practice the essentials of the sages. The essentials of the sages comprise three teachings, which, though divided into three, ultimately return to one.

The first lies in Confucianism, whose essentials are loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom, trust, and culture—virtue upright and canon luminous. These are its essentials. The upper and middle lanes all speak of this. *This* is what is meant.

The second lies in the Dao, whose essentials are emptiness and invisibility, purity and simplicity, clarity and stillness, non-action, illuminating the spirit and mastering *qi*, compassion abundant and harmony gentle, universal beneficence without end, merging as one with the dust, returning to life and restoring the origin. These are its essentials.

*Emptiness and invisibility, purity and simplicity*—the original body of emptiness and invisibility, formless spirit as spirit. In movement and stillness, everywhere pervading, nowhere not radiant. Pure and unadorned, awakened across the three ages. Embodied in the Dao, thus thus, wondrously holding the true. *Clarity and stillness, non-action, illuminating the spirit and mastering qi*—responding to things with feeling to seek form, within form grasping meaning and returning to forget feeling. Illuminating the spirit like the moon over river and sky, *qi* vast as the flood when humans naturally awaken. *Qi* masters the spirit, which summons itself; non-action and clarity harmonize. The body gains the pure yang abode—what worry for the sprouts of the elixir field? The true expands, *qi* vast embraces the plain; the Three Officials naturally attain firmness. The primordial spirit this day roams freely, bright moon and clear wind as companions. Essence and blood nourish the spirit’s sprouts; dwelling in turbidity, spirit and *qi* harmonize. The lord rests in tranquil ease; the ascending maiden burns with allure. Exiting the palace, riding the official’s steed, golden saddle and jade pendants sway. Beneath the moon of Xiaoxiang, with a flick of the whip, pointing toward the White Cloud Bridge.

*Compassion abundant and harmony gentle, universal beneficence without end*—within and without, compassion and gentleness, magnanimity employing the Dao’s subtlety. All receive boundless moisture; the bright moon shines on clear waves. Compassion loves all living beings to abundance; gentleness, when present, nurtures and multiplies. Boundless, universal grace equal in kindness—willow bank, river head, wind swift. The moon over Qiantang shines on the eastern suburbs; in the depths of farmland flowers, lush and dense. The Milky Way, a few cold stars; candles break the dark pass to the northeast.

*Merging as one with the dust, returning to life and restoring the origin*—merging one, grasping the three, the hundred and two; with the dust, the wondrous principle most ungovernable. Returning to the origin, parents restore their mandate—only then reaching the land of true light without obscurity. The dream of floating life, rigid and hollow; all the dust and sand are but emptiness. Awakening to the original face—this is the foremost achievement. Fame, wealth, worldly passions—floating illusions, many as morning dew compared to the river. How much better to awaken swiftly to the great passing, when the wondrous intent moves, humans naturally harmonize. Within form seeking the true, the heart employs *qi*; *qi* arises, the heart brightens, the Dao unobstructed. Grasping heaven and earth’s spring within the gourd; willow bank, clear wind, wondrous and boundless.

The first yang just emerging, the cold toad embraces simplicity. Green waters murmuring, clear winds rustling. Ancient banks of Xiaoxiang, a boat moored, drums and horns sounding. The noble scion stands tall; within the wondrous, music.

The three teachings reside in Buddhism, their essence lying in compassion, forbearance, ultimate equality, mutual causality, universal benefit to all beings, entry into the formless Dharma, and the expounding of the *Mahābodhi Sūtra*. The profound and luminous true sovereign—these are the essentials.

Compassion is to deliver all beings from the river of desire, enabling them to cross the waves of suffering. With unified heart, one reaches even the darkest ghostly realms, dissolving all karmic debts, whether near or distant. Liberated from the realms of suffering, they dwell in the land of tranquility.

Forbearance is to remain unshaken amid all hardships, unmoved by slander, as true suchness abides. When the mind is extinguished and the four attachments cease, distinctions of self, others, beings, and lifespan dissolve.

Ultimate realization is to see through all dharmas of floating life as illusory, like dreams. If even the Dharma is provisional, how much more so mere appearances? All conditioned things obscure awakening. Investigating all conditioned forms, one awakens to their nature as bubbles and illusions. Knowing all to be dreamlike emptiness, one turns back to the primordial origin. Illuminating the dream of floating life, the primordial spirit naturally becomes clear. With no-mind, one attains stillness, and wind and moon become neighbors. The clear whistle echoes through green mountains, the Xiao and Xiang rivers run limpid. The boundless scenes by the river all reside within the imperial city.

Equality is to regard life and death, near and distant, as old debts, dissolving them all with a single intent. Skillfully aiding the living and delivering the dead in due time, if one does not stray from the moment, the Dao is present.

Mutuality is to awaken and ascend to the pure other shore, while deluded passions and defiled forms drag one into sinking. Floating through the three realms in ceaseless succession, how lamentable that countless youths remain unaware.

Causality is to plant good causes and reap good fruits; sowing evil seeds, evil multiplies. Great indeed is causality, mirror-like in its clarity, step by step revealing the workings of karmic retribution.

Universal benefit to all beings, entry into the formless Dharma, and expounding the *Mahābodhi Sūtra* mean that all appearances are dreams, yet the formless is the true body. Within clarity, the primordial *qi* abides, mutually sustaining long-lasting spring.

The profound and luminous true sovereign is perfect awakening, radiant and true. Within truth, movement and stillness must not sink. Without this, how could one appreciate the moon over the river? Green waters and blue mountains will not fail you.

Thus, the essentials of the three great sages share a single source yet manifest differently; they are one yet diversify in transformation. The formless body expounds the formless teaching, universally benefiting all with equality and loving-kindness. Their responsive transformations are boundless, as immeasurable as grains of sand. All speak of the true and correct teaching, aiding the dead and transcending life.

Those who can initiate and complete these essentials with reverence, practicing them without negligence, shall attain true nobility. *Zhao* means beginning; *jing*, completion; *li*, reverence; *zhu*, these.

The three great sages expound the myriad dharmas for humans and gods, their creations unalike yet fundamentally the same, returning to oneness. As the *Dao* says: "The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two give birth to the Three, and the Three give birth to the myriad things." All things flourish, each returning to its root—this is the many dividing from the One, the many returning to the One. There is only the One Vehicle, no second or third—this is called returning to sameness. Even the sages unify all with the One. The great Dao has its order, different paths converging in the same destination. Thus, the noble person is not confined to one corner.

My former teacher said: The three great sages all manifest responsive transformations, adapting to vessels and circumstances, shaping their compassion to deliver beings. Yet later generations, foolish and flawed, cling to distinctions, asserting their own views while rejecting others, breeding jealousy and harm, mutual love and hatred. Such actions lead all to hell. Future talents should take heed. Thus, the sages say: "Clinging leads to loss."

Laozi said: "I treat the good with goodness, and the not-good with goodness—thus virtue is goodness. I trust the trustworthy, and the untrustworthy with trust—thus virtue is trust." One who thoroughly grasps this principle, practicing it day and night without restraint, will find goodness effortlessly attained.

A verse says:
Take refuge in the Dao, Buddha, and Confucius,
Day and night without restraint, ever following.
Applying the principles of the three sages,
What worry of not reaching the Phoenix Pool?

**Chapter Twenty-One: Cultivating the True**

To tread the land of the Dao is called cultivating the true.

A verse says:
Mingling traces with the dust, the feet rest,
Within the gourd, grasping the imperial state.
The clear river reflects the moon in the vast sky,
Green grass leans on the ancient riverbank.

The Dao of cultivating the true is the nobility of the sage. What is noble? The primordial *qi*. What is primordial? The luminous spirit, the ancestor of all things. What is *qi*? The yin and yang, the progenitor of forms. The Dao of the sage is esteemed because of the primordial *qi*. The foundation of primordial *qi* is valued for essence and blood.

When primordial *qi* is complete, it aligns with water and fire, regulates lead and mercury, harmonizes the *zhen* soul, and attains longevity. Complete primordial *qi* means male essence and female blood, firm and unyielding. Aligning with water and fire means uniting with *li* and *kan*. Regulating lead and mercury means refining the lead of *qian* and tempering the mercury of *kun*. Harmonizing the *zhen* soul means merging the soul of the *zhen* palace with the true essence of the Green Dragon.

Longevity is the land of unending day. When primordial *qi* is depleted, it aligns with pure yang, replenishes water and fire, uplifts the *dui* spirit, and restores life. Aligning with pure yang means conforming to *zhen* and *dui*. Replenishing water and fire means adding the marrow of *li* and drawing the *qi* of *kan*. Uplifting the *dui* spirit means raising the spirit of the *dui* palace and grasping the soul of the *zhen* palace.

Why mention only the images of *qian*, *kun*, *li*, *kan*, *zhen*, and *dui*, omitting *gen* and *xun*? Thus, the sage says: "To舉 one corner without reflecting the other three."

The two inner images likewise follow and benefit thereby. Thus, they were not mentioned, for excessive speech is inferior to abiding in the center.

"Restoring life" means yang attaining yin and returning to the root, while yin attaining yang is called "restoring life." This is what is meant by stabilizing what is complete and harmonizing what is depleted. When sufficiency is achieved, it is refined into elixir; when cinnabar encases mercury and it wanes, replenish mercury with cinnabar. Nourish *qi* with *qi*, and spirit with spirit. The *qi* and blood of yin are excellent, able to replenish the spirit and essence of yang. The spirit and essence of yang are excellent, able to nourish the *qi* and blood of yin.

To expel dampness as an affliction: within the human body, there are three palaces. The upper and middle are called the "Muddy Pellet" and the "Crimson Palace," while the lower is called the "Primordial Palace." These three abodes are where spirit, *qi*, essence, and blood reside—places where damp yin evil should not linger. Thus, when dampness afflicts, it must be repelled. In this way, the wondrous body is perfected.

If one can achieve this, the Dao-body is attained. The essential pivot of self-cultivation lies herein; the foremost principle of practice begins here. Those who uphold this may become divine immortals. Those who practice this may ascend to the yang heavens, enter the Golden Gate, and attain the body of a divine immortal.

The *Dong* says: Move the *qi* and still the spirit, enrich the blood and refine the essence—thus one gradually achieves fulfillment. Fill the abdomen and strengthen the bones, fortify the brain and abide in the world. Though not ascending to heaven in broad daylight, one may still attain longevity without aging.

The *Song* says:
Man is true yang—seek yang within yang,
Refining it to prosperity’s height.
One who reciprocally restores life
Dwells in the immortal’s land of endless light.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Refining Nature**

When the seed of true awakening is planted, the body is rightly called the Daoist’s form. The greatest task in refining nature is to govern the thieves. These thieves are five in number, corresponding to the five phases—they are called the "Five Thieves."

The first is *zhi* (will), whose nature is fear, called the "Cold Thief." If one can govern it, it is called the "Leakless Nature." *Zhi* is the essence of water and the master of kidney *qi* in humans, governing the will. Its nature is fear, hence the "Cold Thief." The will of kidney *qi* manifests as terror, dread, and alarm—this harms the spirit of primordial awakening. If one can govern it, it is called the "Leakless Nature": the light of wisdom illuminates this fearful will, inwardly revealing the true sovereign. Thus, one becomes unafraid, achieving the leakless state—vast, pure, and serene, like the moonlit wind over an ancient shore.

Beyond this lies the formless realm, where all sands and dust are empty.
In perfect stillness, the body abides,
Cool breeze in the bright moon’s glow.

The second is *hun* (soul), whose nature is anger, called the "Wrathful Thief." If one can govern it, it is called the "Cool and Clear Nature." *Hun* is the flourishing of wood and the master of liver blood and gallbladder in humans, governing the soul. Its nature is anger, hence the "Wrathful Thief." The soul of the liver and gallbladder manifests as rage, fury, and contention—this harms the spirit of primordial awakening. If one can govern it, it is called the "Cool and Clear Nature": the light of wisdom illuminates this true soul, awakening to true emptiness, like a dream or lightning. One then returns the light in reflection, with primordial clarity illuminating all—bright moon in autumn skies, cool breeze over ancient shores. Thus, the fruit of coolness is attained, and the land of stillness is realized.

The third is *shen* (spirit), whose nature is joy, called the "Joyful Thief." If one can govern it, it is called the "Inaudible and Invisible Nature." *Shen* is the truth of fire and the master of the heart-spirit in humans, governing spirit and clarity. Its nature is joy, hence the "Joyful Thief." The spirit of the heart manifests as delight, pleasure, and indulgence—this harms the spirit of primordial awakening. If one can govern it, it is called the "Inaudible and Invisible Nature": always observe desire to see its end, always examine the thief to perceive its illusion. Thus, one awakens to the mechanism and reaches the root, turning the gaze inward to reflect the light, achieving the nature of the inaudible and invisible. In this state, sight is insufficient to see, hearing insufficient to hear. One then awakens to life’s burdens as illusory, preserving the spirit with the method of clarity and stillness.

By the riverbank, tender green grass sways,
Reeds and rushes bloom in the breeze.
An ancient shore, a moored boat, moonlit and serene,
Cool wind fills the sleeves.
Primordial clarity now appears,
In the gate of stillness, I am at ease.
The dust of the world brushed away, the true sovereign revealed,
The primordial spirit leaps beyond the gate of life and death.

The fourth is *yi* (intent), whose nature is thought, called the "Greedy Thief." If one can govern it, it is called the "Non-Action Nature." *Yi* is the substance of earth and the master of the spleen and stomach in humans, governing intent. Its nature is thought, hence the "Greedy Thief." The intent of the spleen and stomach manifests as longing, yearning, and contemplation—this harms the spirit of primordial awakening. If one can govern it, it is called the "Non-Action Nature." One who masters this is said to abide in non-action.

The eternal truth of all ages finds its companions in the bright moon and clear wind.

The fifth is *po* (corporeal soul), whose nature is sorrow, called the "Deluded Thief." If one can govern it, it is called the "Great Clarity Nature." *Po* is the qi of metal and the master of the lung qi in humans, for the lung qi gives rise to *po*. Its nature is sorrow, hence the "Deluded Thief." The *po* of the heart and lung qi manifests as melancholy, vexation, and affliction—this harms the spirit of primordial awakening. If one can govern it, it is called the "Great Clarity Nature." One who severs this attains the realm of emerald waters and verdant mountains, the land of eternal spring where night never falls, where great clarity is unobstructed.

These five thieves all reside within the heart. These five thieves are the images of the Five Phases, the origin of the myriad transformations. That which governs the myriad transformations relies upon the lord within the heart. Thus, the sage says: the five thieves all reside within the heart. If one follows them, one revolves through the Three Realms. Following these thieves—indulging in the natures of fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow—one sinks and drowns, drifting through the Three Realms.

The Three Realms are the Desire Realm, the Form Realm, and the Formless Realm. Within the Three Realms, there are the Four Bounds. The Four Bounds are: wealth as the bound of desire, beauty as the bound of love, wine as the bound of delusion, and temper as the bound of wrath. The Three Realms share these Four Bounds—only the love-river of heavenly beings is the苦海 of all sentient beings. The five thieves delight in these very bounds. Thus, the sage says: if one follows them, one revolves through the Three Realms.

Alas! The five thieves sink humanity beyond recovery; the Three Realms stretch endlessly; the Four Bounds loom silently; the love-river surges boundlessly—its ferry and oars are hard to cast off; the Formless Heaven of Yang leaves only empty azure. If one governs them, the spirit treads the immortal capital. "Treads" means to walk. One who governs these thieves—eliminating the natures of fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow—walks the land of eternal spring and divine immortals. Far removed from the Three Realms, dwelling not in the Four Bounds, emerging from this love-river, the body ascends to the Jade Capital, pays homage to the Supreme Emperor, bows to the Heavenly Worthy, rejoicing and leaping with joy as the imperial Dao shines forth.

Thus, in all moments of listening, moving, and observing, one must maintain luminous awareness. Through unceasing refinement and cultivation, one attains boundless blessings and roams in eternal spring.

The *Dong* says: In all actions—whether the heart stirs, intent arises, the body moves, or conduct is enacted—one must constantly observe the wondrous transformations, the profound and luminous true sovereign, and recognize the illusory nature of floating life. Awakening to the realm of falling blossoms, one reflects on the dreamlike span of time. Cultivating this Dao, capturing desires and vanquishing thieves, one soars through the purple palaces and roams in eternal spring.

The ode says:
The deluded sink, the awakened become immortals—
Why cling so stubbornly to scriptures?
In the end, only luminous clarity remains;
Shatter the dusty cage, and heaven is yours.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Illuminating the Plain and Unadorned**

Vast and penetrating clarity is called *ming* (illumination). Primal chaos and undifferentiated simplicity are called *su* (plainness). All people traverse this emptiness and form yet fail to awaken to that illumination and plainness.

"All people traverse this emptiness and form": people dwell in the three times as in a dream, where all is ultimately empty. The three times are the past, the present, and the future. "Fail to awaken to that illumination and plainness": they cling to the illusion of existence within emptiness, unaware that each step is void. From the beginningless kalpa to this day, they remain blind and deaf.

I can shatter this emptiness and form and also traverse that illumination and plainness. "I" is the true within the provisional, the primordial within existence, the existent within the primordial—within the realm of the indistinct and subtle, the one who attains eternal life is called "I," and "I" is the self. "Can shatter": when the five ghosts perish, my body is seen, and my body is luminous everywhere. Why wait for the power to shatter? When no waiting is needed, the thieves sink of themselves.

"Also traverse that illumination and plainness": skillfully departing from all images to enter non-action. "Emptiness and form" refers to the attributes of fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow—the Five Phases govern them, and their natures arise naturally. "Illumination and plainness" refers to the attributes of luminous clarity, pure awareness, unobscured presence, tranquil stillness, and penetrating wisdom. Illuminating and attaining non-action is called *zhao* (luminosity). Unblemished spiritual radiance is called *qing* (purity). Abiding in images without delusion is called *jue* (awareness). Severing all perverse obstructions is called *jing* (stillness). Moving in and out through the same Dao is called *hui* (wisdom). These are the Five Seals of Earth.

If one can shatter this emptiness and form, wisdom and spirit awaken, penetrating illumination arises, one departs from the dharmas of action and enters the formless body. All existent images ultimately return to true emptiness. Thus, one must depart from the formless spirit, which is penetrating yet indestructible, and enter accordingly. Sharing the same Dao without end—only this remains.

The *Dong* says: The nature refined into oneness with the Dao-body, which does not perish—only this body is it. The name of this body is called by the sages, not as a single title. The Dao Lord calls it the "spirit beyond spirit"; Śākyamuni calls it the "Tathāgata’s form"; the sages speak of it as the "lord’s office"; Confucius discusses it as the "benevolent noble person." As for the "true self of the lord and master" and the "vajra of the buddhas and patriarchs," all converge yet follow different paths.

In general, it is but the original nature of humanity—the heart-mind and spirit. Yet this heart-mind and spirit must eliminate the five thieves and remove the five natures. The thieves and natures are fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow. Then one attains the five bodies and ascends the five seals. The bodies and seals are luminosity, purity, awareness, stillness, and wisdom. One who achieves this is called the Dao-body. One who does not achieve this remains a sentient being.

When the Dao-body is fully realized and governed, one is called a divine immortal among ghosts. When the Dao-body is complete, this governance extends to congealing mercury and coagulating lead, merging with the Dao-body, establishing virtue and harmonizing with heaven, accumulating merit and amassing practice—then one is called a divine immortal among the heavens.

The Dao-body not yet complete, yet able to refine essence and transform qi, accumulate virtue and benefit others—this is called the divine immortal of the earthly realm. The Dao-body not yet complete, spirit and essence not yet perfected, yet devoted to loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, righteousness, upright virtue, and gentle harmony—this is called the divine immortal of the watery abode. The Dao-body not yet perfected, good virtue not yet cultivated, yet preserving essence and augmenting qi, refining blood and cherishing spirit—this is called the divine immortal among humans.

The term "Dao-body" refers to the human heart-mind. When the human heart-mind eliminates the natures of fear, anger, joy, thought, and sorrow, and instead embodies luminosity, purity, awareness, stillness, and wisdom—this alone is called the Dao-body. Lest misunderstanding persist, let it be stated again.

The five immortals occupy five ranks. The celestial immortal holds the first, the earthly immortal the second, the aquatic immortal the third, the human immortal the fourth, and the ghostly immortal the fifth. Among these five ranks of immortals, there exists a hierarchy of high and low, for the cultivation of the human heart-mind differs. Should one fail in this, one falls into the five sufferings. The cause of these five sufferings lies precisely in the opposite of this.

A verse says:
The numinous nature is formless Dao,
The sunlight mirrors inner truth.
Where the two ends unite,
For ten thousand ages it cannot sink.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Constant Dao**

The wondrous luminosity of awakening is subtle,
Like an autumn moon reflected in a cold pond,
Vast as the Milky Way.
Qi harmonizes with the cavernous depths,
Yang essence and yin marrow never perish—
Only through breath alone.
Virtue matches the Three Powers,
The principle of spontaneity.

Beneath the shadow of green pines,
Within the shade of verdant robes,
Amidst the wind and moon of Xiaoxiang,
The true thusness manifests its wondrous function.
Three threes and six sixes,
Kan and Li penetrate the valley.
Subtly responding to yin and yang,
Illuminating without desire.

A verse says:
The imperial palace wreathed in auspicious mist,
Everywhere rivers and mountains draped in rosy clouds.
Purple phoenixes and flying simurghs form canopies,
Gold and white jade bloom as precious flowers.
Graceful pavilions by the terrace, dragon towers,
Pure bamboo groves where jade maidens dwell.
Ah, the noble one abides in virtue’s realm,
Where non-action enfolds cinnabar’s alchemy.

Another verse says:
Where the perfected dwells is the land of immortals,
Each step returns to the wondrous realm.
When worldly dust is brushed away, mountains and waters shine;
When the Dao-heart opens, pines and bamboos flourish.
The pure wind befriends the bright moon;
The quiet valley’s neighbor is no worldly fool.
Only white clouds, boundless,
Morning and evening soar with me.

Another verse says:
When the immortal lord attains the Dao, he is first called true.
Neither in turbidity nor in clarity does he reside,
Neither excessive nor deficient,
Nor does he stand in the middle way.
How to speak of the subtle and wondrous?
Today, within these words, let it be carefully discussed.
The Dao is neither this nor that,
Life and death, honor and disgrace lie in the living heart.

The constant Dao is neither transformative nor creative.
The constant Dao flows day and night,
Moment by moment, mutually sustaining.
Not this, yet not severed from life—
Those who attain it dwell without decay.

Neither transformative nor creative,
It moves and rests, nourishing all things.
Vast and indistinct, merging with principle and spontaneity,
The spirit shines like a plain candle.

The constant true is neither name nor form.
The constant true in daily use is pure and true,
Radiant above the heavenly court.
Harmony held in hand, wondrous power ever renewed.
Neither name nor form—
Yet name and form may be ascribed.
When power ultimately declines,
Beyond this designation, one enters true numinosity.

In movement, it responds to things with virtuous power.
Original true pervades and illuminates,
Profoundly clear and wondrous.
What comes is met as in a mirror’s brilliance.

In stillness, it is serene and profoundly clear.
True thusness dwells within the three thousand realms,
Accordant with principle and heaven, wondrous and unceasing.
Within the gourd, the bright moon and pure wind,
Everywhere Xiaoxiang’s waters bear boats.
The bamboo path, secluded and cool, wind rustles the leaves,
A stretch of Southern Mountain veiled in misty valleys.
Pausing to gaze, the golden saddle falls—
All around, misty peaks gleam like pearls and jade.

At this moment,
No cultivation, no realization.
Good and evil both vanish, cause and effect dissolve—
How distinguish between this and that, dawn and dusk?
The clear radiance of the face shines through the ages,
Snow-clad plum blossoms, bamboo on the boughs.

Accordant yet not confined,
Entering the wondrous numinous—
Truly the spirit beyond spirit,
The Dao of the profound void.
Freely roaming heaven and earth,
Why tread this river and mountain alone?
The great Dao of the Zhou responds without color,
The wondrous principle returns yet does not return again.

A clear note fills the sleeve—
The jade flute’s three refrains chill the zither’s strings.
Original true penetrates beyond the prior heavens,
Breaking through the dusty sands of the desire realm.
With all things, it competes yet does not perish;
Yin and yang arise yet do not exhaust.

All-pervading, without gap—
Such is the Mystery upon Mystery.
