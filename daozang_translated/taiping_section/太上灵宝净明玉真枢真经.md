The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Pure Clarity and the Jade-True Pivot

Master Danyang studied the Dao in the Palace of Fusang, awakened to truth in the Jasper Towers, received the upright *qi* of Fenglong, and drank the supreme essence of the celestial river. Gazing back upon the great void, he attended the Jade Purity, ascended the courtyard of the Cavern Spirits, and obtained the Scripture of the Jade-True.

Its words are profound and limpid, illuminating nature and penetrating the heart—sufficient to refine *qi*, sufficient to make the spirit take flight. Only the spirit, vast and boundless, may stride effortlessly through the Three Realms and beyond. Who says the Dao cannot be learned? Only through tireless contemplation of the subtle does one attain it. Who says immortality cannot be sought? Only through unwavering stability of nature does one achieve it. The true sages cannot be seen or heard; only through sincerity, reverence, and purity may one encounter them. The void cannot be traversed; only through emptiness, tranquility, and upright stillness may one awaken to it.

One who grasps the pivot of the Jade-True sets the primordial net aright. When the primordial net is set aright, then in every step, word, and discourse, one may converse with the Heavenly Perfected.

Sitting in purity at night, the heart’s nature shines bright,
Soaring through the void, ascending to the Three Clarities.
Visualizing the stellar altar in the central courtyard,
Suddenly, riding emptiness, a body beyond the body appears.
The Perfected transmit the golden edict of radiant clarity,
Commanding jade essences to fill the sacred vessels.
A gentle breeze drifts, clouds gather thick,
Striding directly into the Great Dipper among the Seven Stars.
Turning and circling through the courtyard of Mars,
Facing east at dawn, west at dusk, beholding our Lord.
Revolving without form, the immortals appear,
Countless true immortals come to welcome and send off.
Twice braving the fires to cross the Winnowing Basket,
All thirty-two heavens are visited and seen.
Unknowing of the wondrous principle in the profoundest mystery,
Yet beholding the treasure chart in the Dipper’s path.
There is yet the subtlest truth beyond words,
Ever contemplating the five-colored smoke above the crown.
Misty clouds dissolve into the natural,
Shifting and transforming without cease.
Now dancing as cranes, now soaring as twin dragons,
Now envisioning the heavens bestowing jade nectar.
The fragrance of the Jade-True permeates flesh and bone,
Making the skeletal frame ascend to the heavenly halls.
The *qi* of the Jade-True sways the empty vastness,
Transporting the kitchen and dwelling to the upper realms.
The fluid of the Jade-True alters all flavors,
Making the myriad excellences attend the Heavenly King.
Above, the Nine Mysteries; below, the Seven Descendants—
Standing firm, one may ride the cloud host.
The primordial net’s flight and stride must not be neglected;
Practiced long, it transforms into merit.
The primordial net is not fixed to west or east,
Now high, now low, like kites dancing in the wind.
Kites dancing in the wind, gazing upon the great void—
The perilous places of the void are the *qiang* winds.
Therein dwell demon kings of vast spiritual power,
Wielding double tablets at the waist, bows of horn.
Indiscriminately seizing souls to Luofeng,
Only the pure and upright *qi* may restrain them.
Without the talismans, one suffers grinding tribulation—
Disciples, take heed and wear my precepts.
Cultivation across the Eight Extremities must not be slackened;
Should loyalty and filial piety falter, the spirits will not protect.
Ten thousand times ten thousand Cavern Spirits descend—
Do not claim Pure Clarity lacks even an inch of merit.
When your name is presented to ascend as an immortal duke,
Know that the immortal duke is bound to the immortal registers,
And may stride to the divine palace.
If you do not delight in the Dao and sink into the Five Turbidities,
What can I do but weep for you?
Clearly and diligently study the *Scripture of the Jade Pivot*,
Lest your spirit and soul drift and drown.
The Jade-True is established within contemplation;
The mind’s intent must be upright and still.
Know that Pure Clarity is ever luminous—
This is the essential realm of the Jade-True Pivot.
