**Preface to the *Mingzhen Collection***

The Dao is fundamentally wordless—yet without words, it cannot be revealed.
The Dao is fundamentally without scripture—yet without scripture, it cannot be illuminated.
To let the unheard hear, to make the unenlightened awaken.

I first paid homage to Master Xuanchong at the Longxing Abbey in Fenyin. After serving him for over a year, the Master journeyed south to the right of Mianshan, while I relocated north to reside on the sunny side of Gushe. At times, the Master’s coughs and spittle became pearls and jade, composed without leisure for deliberation. Whether meditating on antiquity, borrowing from things, exchanging verses, or giving free rein to inspiration, he followed his heart’s desire. Be it in lyrics or hymns, all clarified the宗旨. They expressed the heart beyond the heart, the words beyond words—each phrase revealing truth, each line flowing toward its source. The prose was concise, its meaning profound.

It is said in *Mingzhen*:
*"On the shadowless tree, flowers laugh at the sun;
On the unbudding branch, leaves hold the spring."*

And again:
*"With the horn of a hare, strike open the lock of the Three Poisons;
With the fur of a tortoise, sweep away the dust of the Nine Crossroads."*

Such words transcend form and image, distance sound and color. Without the eye of thorough Dharma wisdom and the clarity of thought-free insight, how could one fathom them? Deep as an abyssal spring, vast as the great void—expansive, luminous. They honor the mysterious wind of supreme virtue, exalt the flourishing splendor of eternal spring; they neither deceive the age with cunning nor parade Dao to dazzle the world.

Limpid and resplendent, like a pearl spinning on a golden plate, its pure radiance boundless.
Brilliant and radiant, like the autumn moon gleaming in the azure sky, its auspicious qi inexhaustible.

The Master passed away during the Jin Cheng’an era. Later, a gentleman of Fenyin, Master Li, returned from the coastal regions to his hometown. The Master, having heard of him, recognized him as a distinguished disciple of [Master] Changchun. Though he wished to become his student, Li declined and instead paid homage to Changchun. Thus, through reverent inquiry, he gained a fraction of the Master’s secret mysteries, unlocking countless insights.

Fortunately, in Puban, there was a fellow Daoist, the aged Wang Juchuan, who sighed in remembrance of the Master’s pearls and jade, praising his extraordinary eloquence in expounding the Dao. His movements were as serene as drifting clouds, his stillness as formless as the valley spirit. He sighed without end.

Then, Master Yang the Recluse and Master Liu, among others, produced the Master’s collection from their sleeves and titled it *Mingzhen Collection*. Fearing its obscurity and dispersal, they ordered its transcription to broaden its transmission. They entreated us to compose a preface, but we were struck with awe and hesitation. How could a vessel as small as a dou or shao contain the hundred rivers? Though repeatedly urged, we persistently declined.

Yet, upon perusing it, we found it like fine wine and lamb stew, delighting all palates. The wonders of embodying the Dao, the applications of attaining the Dao—every utterance and phrase may serve as a bridge for others.

For *mingzhen* means: its resonant sound scatters across the cosmos, unyielding yet ever-emerging, like the Eastern Lord sprouting buds; its true light shines upon heaven and earth, its essence pervading all yet formless, like the ice-wheel mirroring all things. Its brightness equals the blazing sun, its resonance like thunder—such marvels are fully realized.

Written on the third day after the Double Ninth Festival in the year *xinhai*, by the humble and unworthy Zhang Zhiming, Daoist Registrar of Hezhong Prefecture, Fenyin.

*Five Poems on the Wisdom Sword*

**Five Poems on the Wisdom Sword**

1.
For benefiting all, it severs even a feather’s tip,
Pacifying the realm, aiding the lord to quell fierce tyrants.
Rage births killing qi, constricting heaven and earth;
Wrath stirs battle clouds, towering sky and land.
Three feet of cold radiance startle ghosts and demons,
A thousand strands of icy splendor shatter evil spirits.
A single thunderclap beyond the nine heavens—
Transforms into a soaring dragon, vanishing without trace.

2.
Not that yin and yang bear separate edges,
But to expel evil and shatter demons, piercing the frigid void.
Where the *Dantai* falls, the Seven Stars gleam;
When *Zhou Chu* wields it, ten thousand streams run crimson.
Its pristine hue transcends yin and yang, beyond grasp,
Its pure light—heaven and earth cannot contain.
Since vanquishing *Chiyou* of old,
It has secured peace without need for further might.

3.
Drawn from its scabbard, flawless as finest dust,
Like *Ji Zha* ascending to heaven, unburdened by mortal ties.
Rather than let *Huang Chao* disrupt the realm,
It delights in repaying the Han lord by stabilizing ruler and subject.
Its three-foot sway stills all nations,
Its sweeping arc subdues the eight directions, making vassals of all lands.
We must thank the *Xuanyuan* legacy passed down—
Thus it aids the sagely lord in purging treacherous ministers.

4.
Three feet of *Longquan* steel pierces the Dipper and Ox,
Dispelling injustice with each unsheathed stroke.
Its grinding sharpens killing qi, silencing a thousand demons;
Its clashing summons storm clouds, vexing a hundred monsters.
The snow-bright blade, swift as wind, cools the ninth summer month,
The frost-edged tip, like the moon, illuminates the third autumn.
Once all peace is settled,
It hangs forever in the heavens, never to be sheathed again.

5.
I have possessed this treasured sword for many years,
Piercing earth and mountain, attuned to nature’s way.
Auspicious qi forges it, driving all monsters into hiding,
Its polished radiance banishes ten thousand evils.
Glowing brilliance dazzles stars and constellations,
Its resplendent edge spans earth and sky.
Idle, it hangs beside the azure heavens’ palace halls—
No need to wield it again, companion to the immortals.

**Six Poems on Chongpi Valley at Xuandu Abbey**

1.
Chongpi’s ancient traces, a land of flourishing splendor,
Where verdant forests and springs conceal the Daoist abode.
Layered mist unfurls auspicious herbs,
Tiered mountains nurture sacred sprouts.
Dawn’s glow merges with morning’s breath,
Evening’s fading clouds embrace twilight’s hues.
Truly a realm of effortless serenity—
Where dragons transform in vast seas, frogs never cease.

2.
A leisurely stroll through Xuandu Abbey—how wondrous!
Lush groves and towering bamboos veil immortal talents.
Marvelous fruits ripen in season,
Exquisite blossoms bloom each day.
Cranes cry atop pines as clouds drift away,
Tigers roar before cliffs as winds arise.
Who here grasps this cool purity?
In what celestial cavern lies the Jasper Terrace?

3.
Worldly affairs entangle, leaving no escape,
Yet wandering here, all cares dissolve.
Winds weave through nine-fold peaks, their beauty refined,
Mists part from three summits, where grasses and trees grow secluded.
Beyond the gate, clouds veil the woodcutter’s path,
Before the hermitage, a stream conceals the immortal’s boat.
When visitors ask of my hidden purpose,
I point afar to the white snow and laugh without end.

4.
I am but a recluse in the world’s shadows,
Idly seeking secluded paths to Xuandu.
Suddenly, all things fade—no barrier to entry,
In an instant, worldly dust is forgotten, unbound.
My heart resembles the round autumn moon’s clarity,
My nature like drifting wisps of wild clouds.
Let the seasons hasten—time’s passage swift—
Unburdened by fame or gain, I remain free.

5.
Beneath Zhongtiao Mountain, a celestial abode,
Where tranquility makes days and months stretch long.
A thousand peaks, their rocks transformed to jade,
A hundred grasses, their blooms ever fragrant.
Guests are served tea steeped in pine-tip snow,
At night, the censer burns cypress incense.
Should anyone come here,
All worldly cares vanish at once.

6.
Northwest of Zhongtiao lies Xuandu,
Where auspicious hues swirl, Daoist qi unfurls.
Amid emerald bamboos hides the grotto of the Way,
Beneath verdant pines, the immortal’s gate.
Peaks stretch endlessly, lush with lingzhi herbs,
Vast pools cradle luminous pearls that banish night.
Hidden from the world’s clamor,
This pure seclusion mirrors the isle of Penglai.

**Two Poems on Bamboo**

1.
Hollow yet solid, a gentleman’s talent,
Nine sheaths nested—how marvelous!
Defying frost, the phoenix’s fledgling stands proud in the wind,
Scorning snow, the dragon’s heir thrives in the rain.
Deepest green best suits pines by the railing,
Its delicate form pairs perfectly with cypress in cultivation.
At times, shedding its skin to summon clouds and rain,
To witness this, one must ascend beyond the nine heavens.

2.
Few noble species grace the cold cliffs,
Only the finest bamboo endures the years.
Upright integrity befits a life of simplicity,
Hollow heart aligns with the Dao’s unfolding.
Soughing in the wind, its chill purity arrives,
Bearing rain, its cleansing beauty shines.
Who else embodies the eternal, a gentleman’s vessel?
It alone suits the immortal’s cave and the Daoist’s home.

**Three Poems Expressing My Aspirations**

1.
Unwavering resolve leads straight home,
Revealing mist and rosy clouds everywhere.
Caressing stars and constellations—no need for words,
Driving winds and clouds—no cause for boasting.
When nature settles, the five aggregates dissolve,
When life arises, what need for the three vehicles?
Every person possesses the scenery of Caoxi,
The Penglai isle lies but a hand’s reach away.

2.
True leisure, true joy—called *Xuanchong*,
Seventy years of nurturing idleness.
Everywhere, forests and springs offer new livelihoods,
In every household, clouds and waters carry old traditions.
A thousand scriptures traversed, all knowledge forgotten,
Ten thousand dharmas explored, yet inexhaustible.
I tell my disciples of this message:
The moon sets in the west as waters flow east.

3.
A Daoist’s livelihood holds no cares,
The moon of nature shines freely.
Cultivating simplicity needs no external search,
Refining truth requires no inner striving.
The luminous pearl radiates through heaven and earth,
The pristine moon gleams upon the Dipper and Ox.
The wondrous Dao has ever been pure,
In the Celestial Capital, I roam at ease.

**On the Deep Stream of Chongpi Valley**

North of *Tiaoyang*, a stream flows,
Irrigating three fields where crops grow secluded.
Its sound, like wind through emerald mountains,
Its qi, merging with daylight, floats upon the waters.
A thousand waves churn from the pearl’s cavern,
Ten thousand currents hasten the fisherman’s boat.
How laughable—*Xu You* washing his ears!
Far better to emerge from the waves, heart gladdened.

**Three Poems Admonishing the World**

1.
Worldly affairs rush by, day after day,
Oblivious to the wellspring of spirit, never pausing to reflect.
In the arena of gain and loss, tongues brandish swords,
Amid the waves of right and wrong, lips clash like spears.

**On the Fleeting World**

In the mortal realm, time rushes by in haste,
Beyond the world, spring days stretch long and vast.
This fleeting glory—how can it compare?
Who knows the sands of samsara teem with immortal lands?

Alas! Worldly affairs bring ceaseless toil,
Vying for breath, craving wealth, all turns to spoil.
A thousand snares entangle, no escape in sight,
Ten thousand bonds obstruct the Way’s pure light.
Turn your head, break free from the chains of right and wrong,
Trust your steps, trample the field of fame and gain to song.
Better to retreat where emerald cliffs embrace the stream,
At ease, nurture simplicity, preserve your primal yang’s gleam.

I urge you: shun the arena of strife,
Where schemes and sorrows weave a tangled life.
How can you grasp at fame, a candle in the wind?
Or cling to love, a lightning’s fleeting glint?
To chase renown is not to chase the Daoist’s way,
To seek wealth pales beside the quest for truth’s array.
If you would leap beyond the world’s entangling net,
Return early to the cliffs and burn your heart’s incense yet.

**To Master Zhang of Fenyin**

I bow to you, my kindred spirit, Zhang the Daoist true,
Since parting, have you thrived in truth’s unchanging hue?
No wild geese bring word from Penglai’s isle,
No cranes convey the spring of Lang Garden’s smile.
In the Daoist abbey, wind alone keeps you company,
In the silent meditation hall, bamboo stands nearby.
Do not forget our verse-bound vow, my friend,
To share the moon’s pure light o’er towers that ascend.

**Three Laments for Horse Ma**

Alas! Noble steed, how grievous your fate,
For ten years you bore me, now your life abates.
Your spirit drifts away from this mortal plane,
Three souls wander, leaving no trace again.
Your saddle and bridle hang idle, my strength undone,
No whip nor rein stirred—yet your service was done.
To shed your form and return to the source is best,
With spring’s thunder, ascend as a dragon in flight’s crest.

Mournful! Peerless courser, swift and bright,
I yearned for you endlessly, day and night.
Daily you roamed the vast desert sands,
Ever responding to the land’s commands.
For years you spread virtue with boundless might,
Today you part, your debt repaid in full light.
May your true spirit transcend the world’s chain,
Plunge into the vast sea, reborn as dragon again.

Alas! My swift steed, how I mourn your flight,
You traversed mountains and rivers, near and far in sight.
Now you depart before me, your task complete,
While I remain, my journey incomplete.
For years you bore me like a soaring phoenix grand,
Today you fade, transformed to a dragon’s band.
Gently you rise to the purple courts above,
At peace, your steps now join the immortals’ love.

**Nurturing Simplicity in Tranquility**

The Daoist’s livelihood knows no pride nor excess,
In quiet emptiness, the years softly pass.
Silent, he nurtures spirit—what need for wine?
Drowsy, he guards life—no tea can refine.
At peace, he cultivates simplicity, pure and true,
Vigilant in virtue, idle, yet ever new.
Refining the priceless treasure of primordial dawn,
He rides the simurgh, vanishing to the immortal throng.

**Two Poems on Serene Detachment**

Ever have I scorned the furrowed brow,
My nature at ease—what cause for sorrow?
The bright moon illumines, all karma fades,
The clear wind brushes past, ten thousand ties unmade.
Let the world’s waves roll on beyond the street,
Let storms rage outside—here, all flows sweet.
I’ve learned the art of idleness, carefree as can be,
Lost in blissful sleep, snoring with glee.

No entanglements, no strife—what more to seek?
Unfettered, all things cease, my spirit sleek.
Worldly manners swirl, yet never cling,
Worldly affairs rush by, leaving no sting.
The luminous pearl of spirit—how could it be marred?
The moon of nature—how could it be scarred?
No need to exhaust your steps in Lang Garden’s quest,
Awakened, you turn and arrive at Penglai’s rest.

**Two Poems on the Preciousness of Naturalness**

A spark of numinous clarity—nature’s own art,
Why labor to seek immortals with weary heart?
After rain, the jewel-mountain’s stones gleam like jade,
In the Dharma sea, clouds part, fire blooms a lotus’ blade.
Awakened, you hear not the lion’s roar,
Enlightened, you cast off the fox’s deluded lore.
Embrace the Supreme’s profound, mysterious play,
Leap beyond yin and yang, beyond the Emperor’s sway.

Cultivating truth requires no strenuous toil,
Cease your futile efforts, foolish disciple’s coil.
To shake marrow and sinew—all is but vain,
To swallow saliva, absorb fluids—how misguided the strain.
The elixir of spirit needs no varied craft,
True qi is bound by no single path or draft.
How laughable—those who seek without,
When the immortal’s road lies within, close about.

**Two Poems on Finding Joy in Idleness**

In idleness, joy arises, no need for hermit’s cell,
Why dwell in cloud-capped peaks or valleys fell?
Silent, I set aside the Three Teachings’ tome,
Drowsy, I leave the Five Carts’ scrolls alone.
My household’s ways are sparse, yet nothing’s lacking,
My livelihood is pure, with naught in lacking.
Not in Lu’s capital, sitting idle in vain,
The mirror of the Dao reflects the round and plain.

Deep in the valley’s seclusion, I build my thatched retreat,
Far from the bustling markets, my dwelling sweet.
In the Palace of Everlasting Night, a guest at ease,
In the Hall of Perpetual Light, no scholar’s chains to please.
The Dharma sea’s waves settle, still and clear,
The spirit pool’s depths lie empty, without fear.
The elusive fish grasps the pearl—no need to strive,
No labor of thought to dream in Hua Xu’s hive.

**To Daoist Li Zhiyu**

Truly at ease is Daoist Li,
From the first, a speck of dust defies his eye.
Wisdom shines, precepts firm—words fail to tell,
Awareness of non-action speaks but seldom.
The blessed lands and forests are his friends,
The grotto heavens and flowing clouds his kin.
Turning his light within, he grasps eternal spring’s delight,
Leaping beyond yin and yang, beyond the kalpas’ blight.

**To Daoist Wu the Judge**

This old man, too lazy to grasp brush and ink,
Startled to find his temples touched by frost’s link.
Before my eyes, familiar scenes—time flies swift,
Beyond the world, my household’s ways—long days drift.
I strive to learn Chen Tuan’s threefold sleep,
No need to echo Du Fu’s ninefold grief.
Content, I’ll be an idle, carefree sage,
Shedding worldly toil—what harm in age?

**Two Poems Expressing My Feelings**

Leaning on my staff, I wander from my thatched abode,
Gaze afar o’er fields—no brocade could match this road.
Geese depart Hengyang, the sky pale and wide,
Swallows leave the sea peaks, rain scatters the tide.
A river of beauty—peach blossoms unfold,
The earth awash in spring—willows unroll.
At dusk I return, with naught to do,
Nurturing spirit and simplicity, joy ever true.

All things forgotten, I never leave my hut,
Hiding my traces, unbound, my form at ease.
Worldly gains and losses—all fade away,
Before my eyes, floating glory—each thing grows distant, gray.
When inspired, I sit cross-legged on my rush mat,
When weary, I stretch on my earthen bed flat.
Now I’ve become a carefree, idle old man,
Joyful and free, the Dao’s essence my plan.

**Inscribed at Xuantong Abbey in Wanggu Valley**

Wanggu’s legacy holds a starry altar’s trace,
Xuantong Abbey—where immortals dwell in grace.
Mountains lush, clouds veil bamboo where phoenixes alight,
Earth abundant, mists shroud springs where dragons take flight.

A single peak holds imperial deeds of a thousand years,
Three imperial summons to the immortal’s pavilion—eternal fame.
The Transcendent Emperor eludes all mortal sight,
Yet his pure name, undying, resounds through past and present.

**Seven-Character Quatrain**
*Awakening the Mind*

To set the heart on truth is easy—long endurance hard,
Unwavering as Mount Tai, steadfast in resolve.
Sever the bonds of love, let dust not cling,
And naturally, with ease, attain serene repose.

**In Reply to Master Wang’s Inquiry: Where Lies the Dao?**

Forget transgressions, quell desires, and steel the heart,
The Dao abides in emptiness—where to seek its trace?
Recognize your original, true visage,
And in the act of taking up and laying down, find a kindred soul.

**For Master Zhang, Who Fails to Awaken**

Break the locks of care, draw forth the self,
Sever the snares of fame—then rest is found.
If your nature is like the azure sky, clouds drifting free,
All entanglements dissolve, and the heart rejoices unbound.

**For Daoist Li**

Li the Daoist, free of thought, embraces non-action,
To set all things aside—this is perfection’s way.
Having attained the joy of eternal life,
He leaps beyond the springs of yin and yang, beyond the kalpas’ sway.

**Ode to Tea**

The Golden Lad plucks leaves of magic lingzhi,
The Jade Maiden gathers sprouts from Penglai’s garden fair.
Should one know this flavor’s worth,
Its pure fragrance surpasses Zhao Zhou’s tea beyond compare.

**The Divine Pearl**

Round and formless, without trace or track,
Ten thousand rays of rosy light pierce the azure sky.
Illuminating the great chiliocosm, embracing the Dharma realm,
How could heaven and earth ever hope to confine it nigh?

**Chan and the Dao**

Chan is the Dao, the Dao is Chan—non-action their way,
Dao and Chan are not two, no bias, no decay.
Originally one point, without distinction’s art,
Limpid and clear, it ever manifests before the heart.

**Sitting in Purity**

Limpid and still, in the quiet chamber’s space,
Gather the spirit in silent nurture of form.
Soul at peace, spirit purified, host and guest unite,
All thoughts forgotten—nothing remains, no single trace.

**The Authentic Collection of Xuanyuzi Concludes**
