**Preface to the Complete Works of Zhongyang (Chongyang Quan Zhen Ji Xu)**

The Complete Way of Truth is vast indeed!

By *Truth (真)*, I mean the utmost purity without admixture, enduring through the eons, the primordial ancestor of the One, and the great lineage of all things.

In the earliest antiquity, humans possessed pure *virtue/power (德)*, their nature as innocent as a babe, self-governed without need of herding, self-ordered without need of transformation. Dwelling in ease, they found contentment naturally, all enjoying longevity and tranquility—this was their harmony with the Dao/Way in its true essence.

Yet in later ages, human nature grew corrupted, the Dao/Way vanished and *virtue/power (德)* was lost. The original simplicity scattered, the pure became defiled. Lust and desire gnawed within like maggots, sorrow and grief assailed without like spectral flames. Nature swayed with passions, passions were led astray by external influences—dispersed and never gathered, lost and never returned. The pristine essence was exhausted, souls wandered through life and death, chasing fleeting realms and transient causes, trapped in endless suffering with no hope of escape. Truly, this calls for a long sigh of lamentation!

Master Zhongyang pitied the *Miaoxing (妙行) True Person*, who was well-versed in the Three Teachings (三教), penetrating the wisdom of a hundred schools. He encountered a sage at Ganhé River (甘河), found a kindred spirit in the East Sea (东海), transformed the virtuous men of three prefectures, and bound the five communities (五社) in harmonious ties. His teachings saved and guided beings, benefiting all sentient life and embracing all things.

Those who heard of his ways held him in reverence and awe. Wherever his staff and sandals passed, people gathered like mist, seeking his instruction. He never refused any who came. His verses, songs, and miscellaneous writings flowed effortlessly from nature, composed spontaneously for every occasion.

His teachings, broadly speaking, led beings back to sincerity and simplicity, to stillness and emptiness, nurturing the eternal soul’s essence, revealing the wondrous nature of *Suchness (真如)*, recognizing the original face of existence, and restoring them to the eternal constancy of the Dao/Way, returning them to its ineffable mystery.

Someone once asked the True Person: *"Among all beings in heaven and earth, though humans are said to be the most refined, are they not just one thing among myriad things? Who can escape the cycles of yin and yang? Who can transcend the workings of creation? All that begins must end, all that lives must die—this is the natural order of things. Without cultivating extraordinary *qi (气)*, immortality cannot be sought. Without aligning with one’s predestined fate, the Dao/Way cannot be learned. How can one exhaust oneself in rigid asceticism, chasing shadows or grasping wind, carving ice or sculpting rotten wood, for something that is inevitably unattainable, striving for an impossible result?"*

The True Person sighed deeply and said: *"The mysteries of eternal life are within all people. Who cannot seek the immortal groves? Those who fail from neglect are indeed numerous and obvious; those who succeed through diligence are few and hidden. The world believes what it sees and doubts what it does not see, thus deeming immortality a distant, unattainable dream.

Let us test this with natural principles: iron can be forged from ore, gold refined from copper. Fish that leap beyond Lüliang (吕梁) become dragons, wildfowl that enter great waters transform into *fenghuang (凤凰)*. Even ice, which melts easily, can endure the summer if concealed; grass, which withers quickly, can survive the winter if covered.

If humans can sever attachment and abandon greed, maintain humility and hold fast to the One, wander their hearts in serenity, and blend their *qi (气)* with the void, they too can ascend to lofty heights, tread upon the light, ride the breezes of the *Killer Wind (寇)*, and traverse the paths of the *True Person’s blessings (真)*. They can ride the whale across the boundless seas, soar with the phoenix to the azure void, living a thousand years like the crane of Liaodong (辽东), or aging in reverse like the teal of Yè County (叶县). Such beings would stand alongside Anqi (安期) and Xiànmén (羡门), the masters of Hongya (洪崖) and Dongxuan (洞玄), as equals in the ranks of immortals—this would not be difficult.

Across the ages, those who attained the Dao/Way and moved with ease are countless. Yet I say this without evidence: like the deaf who hear no music, or the blind who see no colors, those with shallow insight and narrow hearing cannot truly speak of the Dao/Way."*

The questioner, humbled and awestruck, fell silent and withdrew.

The True Person then opened the gates of flexibility, revealed the boundless ocean of compassion, and rescued beings from the burning house of suffering, guiding them across the vast mire of delusion. He showed them the primordial roots of life and death, the harmonious interplay of *qi (气)* and spirit, the unity of existence and non-existence, the merging of emptiness and form in the realm of dual forgetting.

For those who entered this path, it was as if awakening from the *Southern Grove Dream (南柯梦)*; for those who walked its way, it was like sobering from the *wine of Zhongshan (中山)*. They returned to their original truth, complete and without deficiency, and re-entered the undifferentiated unity; they restored their ancestral Dao/Way, unfallen and unlost, and aligned once more with the primordial beginning.

The nature of the True One is profound and luminous, ever-adapting through transformation and resonance—nowhere does it fail to harmonize.

After the True Person’s ascension, his disciples gathered his remaining works, numbering over a thousand pieces. Their language is vast and profound, their meanings vast and deep, steeped in the true winds of the Dao/Way, containing the wondrous essence of existence. They are the very foundation of true cultivation, the ladder by which others are guided across.

The Daoist communities of Jingzhao (京兆) raised funds and had them printed, though many in the Eastern Prefectures (东州) who followed the Dao/Way found the journey to obtain them too distant. Master Siu (刘), the *Longevity Sage (长生)*, was a beacon of the teaching, a model of the immortal lineage, the foremost master of his age, and the guide for all four directions.

It is said that the Complete Way’s teachings arose in the West, flourished in the East, and spread throughout the world—vast and profound indeed! Thus, he commissioned *Lingyun (灵玉)* Cao, *Lingyun (灵玉)* Lái, *Shoudao (守道)* Xú, *Zhenyi (真一)* Liú, *Tongzhen (通真)* Liáng, and *Daoqing (道清)* Zháì, all virtuous masters, to journey specially to my homeland and request this preface from me.

The *True Person’s* (真人) literary collection is divided into nine volumes, which were then printed and widely disseminated to all directions.

Thus, those who come after may obtain this collection and delve deeply into its words, as one who digs a well and finds mud—knowing water is not far—
or who bores wood and sees smoke—knowing fire must be near.
So that all may awaken early and swiftly attain the Dao/Way,
this is indeed the benevolent one’s (仁者) intent.

Alas! From ancient times, those who cultivated the Dao/Way—
some sought teachers by foot only to find them absent,
others severed their arms to inquire of the dharma (法) yet failed to grasp it,
and in the end, even after years of white-headed toil,
they knew not where to turn,
wasting their lives in vain—
how deeply regrettable!

Now, the *Complete Dao/Way’s* (全真) literary collection
scatters among the people,
its subtle applications and profound mechanisms
clearly visible and easily understood.
Those who study and follow it
will find great efficacy if they earnestly pursue it,
and small gains if they seek modestly.

For those who aspire to the Dao/Way,
to encounter such a time is indeed fortunate!

On the first day of *Great Clarity* (清明) in the year *Great Stability* (大定) *Wuxin* (戊申),
*Fàn Zé Dé* (范择德), the *Learning Officer* (学正) of *Nínghǎi Prefecture* (宁海州),
respectfully composed this preface.

The *First Volume of the Complete Dao/Way’s* (全真集卷之一) *Chóngyáng* (重阳) Collection
Composed by *Master Chóngyáng* (重阳子) *Wáng Zhé* (王哲) of *Zhòngnán Mountain* (终南山)

「A *Seven-Character Regulated Verse* on *The Bond Beyond the Material World*

**One nephew, two sons, and a mountain recluse**—
Together with me, five in heart’s bold quest.
*Six Bright Ones* join the moon of distant skies,
*Seven Pure Ones* call the winds from ocean’s breast.

The *True Marvel* wraps the head in secrets deep,
Upon the *Clear Sky* treads the *Void’s* expanse.
East, west, south, north all turn in perfect round,
Here alone do I know the *Way*’s vast command.

**One brother, one nephew**, two more in this band,
With me, five *Leisurely Ones* seek the *Dao/Way*’s grand.
Bound as *True Kin* beyond the world’s embrace,
We cast off dusty forms, these hollow, fleeting shapes.

A *Pure Quiet* landscape planted all around,
The *Purple Lingzhi* passed from hand to hand.
To *Longhua’s* gathering on the mountain’s height,
I first pay homage to *Penglai’s* lofty guide.

*Master* in *Ninghai* donned in military garb,
With his brother, begging on the streets.
A vast scroll he bore, upon it wrote these two,
To lure *Mǎ Yǔ* along in search and quest.

*Mǎ Sān*, squint-eyed, begged in those days,
Called by others *Harmful to the Wind*.
Five hues of fortune on his body seen,
One spark of *Dao/Way’s* light only he has known.

Eight lines he gathered—*one* swift glance to seize—
Seven-character verses promised, clear as day.
On both sides of the street, the wealthy thronged,
Yet none knew who the silkworm sought.

White for bones, red for flesh, they say,
Red and white together form a hollow clay.
Yesterday they called him *Master Chongyang*,
Today they see him with his brother, begging.

Bodies differ, minds are strange—none grasp the truth,
Faces change, yet none perceive the *Dao/Way’s* proof.
A thousand years of worldly toil in vain,
A hundred years but like a fleeting glance.

*Na Sūn*’s Inquiry
On your own body, speak not of worth or low,
But match the *Three Lights* to *Primordial Tao/Way*’s glow.
Rectify the *Four Gates*, let teaching spread,
One *Nature*’s essence opens wide and free.
In *Cool Tranquility*, you dwell with ease,
At leisure, time itself obeys your decree.

*Elixir of Immortality* stolen from fate’s hand,
True joy unfolds when all desires stand.
To *Master Bàn*’s Question—First Clarity, Then the *Way*
*Release* and *Dao/Way* share one ancient root,
Two forms yet one in essence, never askew.
*True Awakening* sees the heart’s own light,
*Mercury* and *Lead* unite—good seeds take flight.

*Mǎ Zǐ*, do not let rivers shift your oar,
Nor monkeys mimic sands, forever more.
The *Lamp of Wisdom* blazes past the clouds,
Piercing mist to reveal the *Five Colors*’ shrouds.

*Lǚ Gōng*’s Desire to Retire and Seek the *Dao/Way*
With *Three Paths*’ law, he walks with care,
Like ice beneath his feet, the abyss laid bare.
To *Three Paths*’ retreat, he turns with grace,
In *One Marvel*’s essence, he becomes *Pure Clarity*.

Within stillness, he refines the heart’s bright moon,
Where he finds light, his wisdom’s lamp is spun.
A *True Teacher* comes to guide his way,
To *Yùfēng Peak*’s summit, he ascends to play.

*Wáng Gōng*’s Inquiry on the *Five Gates*
At *Five Aggregates*’ mountain, the *Five Gates* unfold,
*Qi* and *Shen* entwined like *Peach of Jade*’s gold.
With *One Decision*, his nature’s light takes flight,
In *True Stillness*, his essence shines—no dimness in sight.

Beyond the world, the *Blue Sky*’s eternal stay,
The *Bright Moon* lingers in the void’s array.
*Blue Boy* presents *Golden Elixir*’s art,
Only *Primordial Tao/Way*’s seekers may impart.

*Mǎ Gōng*’s Inquiry on *Equality*
Come and go must recognize the *Fixed Star*’s span,
Exit and enter still discern the *Luminous One*’s plan.
His transgressions match my own in kind,
May all beings share my heart’s pure mind.

I’ve communed with *Heaven’s* and *Earth’s* spirits bright,
Now I glimpse *Uchang*’s nature—fragrant, clear, and light.
This is the *True Marvel*’s secret key,
If you follow, you’ll reach *Heaven’s* lofty decree.

*Zhāng Gū*’s Inquiry
The *Nine-Leaf Golden Flower* blooms in endless grace,
*Eight Channels of Jade Water* flow at will’s embrace.
The *Seven Gates* open wide—all paths revealed,
The *Four Symbols* shine, yet all dissolve in *Void*’s veil.

One grain of *Divine Elixir* returns to right,
Two strands of *Silver Threads* bind *Primordial Tao/Way*’s light.
Brilliant hues know their own true share,
When fruit is ripe, no lack—only joy remains.

*Grinding the Mirror*
Grinding mirrors strives to polish *my* own heart,
Its depths reflect far, yet still they part.
*Mirror’s* return strips name and gain away,
Revealing *Void*’s truth—no trace to stay.

One spark of *Dao/Way’s* light ignites the *Fire Path*,
A million hues of *Pure Clarity* rise from lofty height.
*Master Jiào* takes the *Mystic Treasure* true,
Hangs it in *Bright Hall* to pierce through ages’ hue.

*In Harmony with the Falling Flowers’ Rhythm*
No need to scheme for lofty flight,
*Blue Cave*’s pearl requires no lock in sight.
Long weary of the world’s vain chase,
I scorn the name and profit, false and base.

How best to guard the heart’s own ground,
Why cling to robes of street and town?
Flowers fall beyond the gates—let winds and rains take sway,
Who will awaken to *Xīyí*’s hidden way?

*Inscribed on the Red and White Peonies*
Red and white silk twisted into clusters tight,
On *Blue Silk* screens they stand in orderly flight.
Fragrance drifts far, no difference known,
Though forms diverge, each holds its proper throne.

Long ago, the world forgot the *Three Islands*’ seed,
Now men mistake these two as one, indeed.
I pluck them now to join their *Tao/Way*’s return,
Each step through clouds and mists, the *Rainbow Crane*’s turn.

*Master Chí*’s Annotation on the *Dao/Way’s* and *Virtue’s* *Classic*
In *Five Thousand Words* of *Tao/Way’s* *Great Sage*’s might,
The *Dao/Way* nameless shines with marvel’s light.
One *Qi* enfolds *Heaven* and *Earth*’s core,
Four seasons guide the *Year’s* *Primordial Mystery*’s lore.

The *Five Phases* unfold *Yin* and *Yang*’s place,
Two *Luminaries* first divide *Creation’s* grace.
Obscure and dim, no words can say,
Yet *Nature’s* secrets hide the *Dao/Way’s* array.

*Sù Xiān*’s Inquiry
Awakening to *Shàohuá*’s six *Ji*’s embrace,
He unites his *One Self* with *Floating Bamboo’s* grace.
No need for incense’s fire to burn,
No need to seek the *Teaching Wind*’s turn.

He opens *Lingming*’s light both near and far,
Lets *Xīngyào*’s radiance pierce east and west afar.
*True* and *False* exchanged—now brilliance gleams,
Each step a *Lotus Flower* leads to *Heaven’s* dreams.

*Xíng Gōng*’s Inquiry on *Seventy-Two Years* of Practice
Even at a hundred, practice is not late,
Only the heart must shift its fate.
This life cannot reach the *Tao/Way*’s full height,
Next life’s promise grants the path of light.

At parting’s hour, one spark must be refined,
The *Three Lights* gathered—none will be left behind.
Cast off the new, abandon the old,
Remove the new—*Lingzhi*’s essence unfolds.

*To Master Xué Dào* Who Seeks the *Dao/Way*
Practice is hindered by a clever mind,
Yet *Golden Adamantine* calls—what’s left behind?
Before men, he boasts of outward grace,
Within, his eyes grow dim—his steps astray.

*True Alchemy*’s key lies hard to find,
*Dao/Way’s* essence rare—*Jade Science*’s mind.
He leaves his wife and sons, what will he say?
Future sins will weigh how light or heavy they’ll sway.»

**To Master Liu Jiang Zhang Yizhong**
Upon receiving Zhang Liang’s *Dao/Way* scripture,
He wanders through fair scenes, finding cool clarity.
His feet tread paths where water and stone merge,
His gaze sweeps clouds and mountains—like a painted screen.
Ten thousand households gleam with three dark birds,
A hundred flowers and grasses share one fragrant breath.

Now I turn back—do not blame my public face,
Yet I ride the southern *Bi*’s emerald *Dongting* lake.

**Spring Rain**
A spring rain nourishes the marsh like butter—
A blessing for the *Tai Ping* age.
Heaven bestows its *qi* to aid the people’s harmony.
The wandering clouds form a canopy—*Three Lights* shine,
Harmonious *qi* brings auspicious signs, nurturing all things.
His enlightened heart grows ever still,
His *Dao/Way*-eyes clearer with each wash.
With staff in hand, he treads the cloud-paths high,
Seeking leisure—his jade carriage overturned.

**Instructing the Simple and Unrefined**
A scholar of *Dao/Way* meets his match—
His crude nature demands harsh refining.
To awaken the blind, fan the fire within his heart,
To open the ignorant, wield the sword of laughter.
If he heeds my teaching and returns,
Let him join our ranks—his fate will turn.

*Ji-ji-ji*—the sage-king’s decree,
Without thought, without care, in blissful *Tao/Way*.

**Alchemy of the Iron Pot**
If black *qi* is destroyed in the body,
On *Badu* Mountain, recognize the *Three Fields*.
Stillness is the return to *Xu*’s emptiness,
In chaos, where shall you seek the *Mystic Dao*?
On wood, seek gold; on water, nurture fire-lotus.
Gentlemen, recognize the *Sword-and-Cinnabar* method,
And aid the *Kingly Wind* with iron-pot coinage.

**Inscription for the *Xiaoyao* Pavilion**
*Xiaoyao*, *Xiaoyao*—this *Xiaoyao*!
Laughing at pines and bamboo, trusting their knocks.
From now on, white clouds come to the cave’s mouth,
No need for green waters or distant mountains.
The *Du* River scholar sighs in vain at filth,
The *Ge* Hall poet mocks in empty wit.
Still, who knows this truth?
Cast aside tortoise hair and hare’s horn alike.

**Master Yang’s Inquiry**
Seven feet tall, his frame a borrowed guise,
His robes and meals surpass three men’s share.
Do not boast of his ordinary bones,
For his golden form stands six *zhang* high.
Awakened, he unites the four directions’ mysteries,
Enlightened, he binds the eastern *Du*’s perfect cause.
His transformed body spans a thousand feet—unobstructed,
Turning the *Dharma* Wheel in the mortal realm.

**Sending Military Judge Brother to Seek the *Anle* Method**
To seek true joy, cultivate the root cause,
Open your heart and leave behind defilement.
In noise, do not let *qi* be wasted,
In stillness, let your spirit be fully nourished.
Naturally, you will recognize the *Three Lights*’ brilliance,
Decisively harmonize the four seasons’ spring.
Externally, your form gleams with clarity,
Internally, your true joy shines—
Mortals unaware, you become an immortal.

**To My Elder Brother**
Who among kin understands the gold in water?
In *Ji Mao* and *Ren Chen*, we each seek our path.
I have already returned to the old *Yunshui* recluse,
Urging you: abandon ambition and name.
The *En* Mountain’s love, the *Hai*’s depths—when will they be crossed?
The *Fire House*’s snares encroach daily.
Do not be ensnared by earthly slopes,
For *Penglai* holds higher, finer peaks.

**Three Essentials for Practice**
Begging for the *Upper* (alchemical substances),
Walking the *Middle* (talismans),
Setting the *Lower* (medicines).
Empty without purpose—this is not the way.
Begging for those who walk talismans and set medicines—
These are the three true practices.
Internally, without purpose, *qi* cannot be refined,
Externally, labor damages the spirit.
If not sought from the origin’s deepest mystery,
Where else shall you find the primal cause?
Here, the *Changshun* scene is uncovered—
Thus, *Xiaoyao* emerges from the six defilements.

**Master Wang’s Request for Release of Life**
Knowing you can observe your own self,
All life is equal—no distinction between us.
Only the form differs, yet all may fly and be whole.
Your virtue matches mountains and rivers’ boundless grace,
Your *virtue/power* flows like streams of blessing.
The *yin* principles are fulfilled—all debts repaid,
His immortal years are offered on the celestial altar.

**Inscription for Master Ma’s True Person’s Hall**
In person, I seek the *True Sage* at *Kunlun*’s peak,
Where ridges and mist lock the *Taihu* void.
Sharp *qi* draws the idle guest,
Harmful winds welcome the colored clouds to dwell.
Golden *qi* forges the true spirit’s nature,
White jade contains the original beginning.
Do not praise *Zhongnan*’s fine scenery—
Wherever the immortals gather, it is as such.

**On the Copulation of Dragon and Tiger**
Do not ask of Dragon’s child or Tiger’s kin—
The single point in your heart is the true teacher.
Adjust the *qi*, steady the spirit, and call for union,
With upright heart and devout essence, nurture warmth.
Equality is the *Great Dao*’s way,
Purity and non-retreat bring true compassion.
Each manifestation reveals the round light,
Guiding the *Golden Elixir* to gather *Jade Grass*.

**Master Sun’s Inquiry on the Three Teachings**
The *Ru*’s gate, the *Release*’s household, and the *Dao*’s path all communicate,
The Three Teachings share one ancestral wind.
Awakened, you know the entering and exiting,
Enlightened, you perceive the vast and boundless.
Spirit and *qi* surpass comparison—
Sun, moon, stars, and constellations may align.
Understanding principles, discerning texts clears disputes,
Above the clear sky, you observe the empty sky.

**Master Ren’s Inquiry on Original Nature**
Like gold, like jade, like pearl—
Vivid, five-colored, spread wide.
Ten thousand rays of light remain unseen,
A clump of dust obscures it all.
Wash and polish to reveal its round form,
Grind and refine to show its original state.
Neither extinction nor birth—leisurely radiant,
Only then do you reclaim its ancient measure.

**The Wooden Fish**
Hollow, heartless, hung in the hall’s courtyard,
Its own strikes echo *dang-ding*.
Its cultivation bears fruit—it draws offerings,
Awakens monks and nuns to chant the scriptures.
Water cannot contain its baited line,
Fire cannot free it from its wooden form.
Suddenly, moonlit wind arrives at dawn,
Blowing apart its clinging vines—its fragrance lingers.

**Ode to Laziness**
I laugh at my own laziness, though called "diligent,"
In dreams, I record the root cause with a brush.
Returning greetings, I keep my mouth shut,
Seeing food, though hungry, I do not speak.
Paper robes, hemp clothes cover my body,
Unkempt hair, filthy face—yet I preserve the *True*.
Nine years in one sleep before I wake,
For fear of toil’s weariness, my spirit dims.

**The Bell**
Cast in the west wind’s likeness,
Suspended in the void, its form honored.
Eighty-one strikes mark the *Yang*’s *Yao* number,
One hundred and eight tolls the *Yin*’s *De* name.
Thus, *Dao* families divide *Zi* and *Wu*,
And *Release*’s children distinguish *Xu* and *Ying*.
If those beside you will long endure its service,
It is the one who truly knows its own voice.

**Congee of Barley**
Honeyed clouds, whiter than frost,
Called *Yazheng*—its fragrance distinct and pure.

**The Jade Scepter**
A precious blade splits jade with light ease,
A silver spoon swirls to pour the nectar’s flow.
The Golden Boy presents fragrant, luminous elixir,
The Celestial Guest chews open light like snow’s hue.
All five *zàng* organs now corrected stand,
Henceforth eternal coolness ever prevails.

**The Drum Tower**
At dusk and dawn, the horn’s mournful cry,
With rapid drums dispels pestilence and calamity.
Water droplets fall in measured time, their rhythm true,
Each clang and toll aligns with fate’s precise decree.
A hundred years pass in relentless nightly pressure,
A lifetime’s bloom fades as each night hastens near.
I urge the poet to awaken early,
Lest the fifth watch’s call steal your clarity.

**Jiang Gong’s Drum Tower**
Its *jīng* blue form holds the Three *Treasures*’ essence,
A towering structure built with solemn intent.
To let its sound resound beyond the void,
And let its pure tones permeate the world.
A single strike of true gold’s thunder,
Shakes the Ten Directions to their own accord.
Great and small alike bow in reverence,
Each one attaining *Perfect Enlightenment*.

**On the Zen and Dao**
In Zen, the *Dao* is glimpsed yet powerless to act,
In *Dao*, Zen’s depths are known—no love nor hate.
The adept who masters both is highest of all,
While the one who gains but one is truly a sage.
Where *Dao*-emotion deepens, clarity stills the mind,
When Zen’s flavor is pure, the heart’s chaos finds peace.
Now cease your Zen and *Dao*—both rise as one,
And naturally ascend to that which transcends them.

**Attending the Governor of Dengzhou at the Qingbai Hall**
Within the Qingbai Hall, a spring of crystal clear,
Its depths profound, its waves both limpid and bright.
Endless it rolls, its flow never ceases,
Splashing forth to nourish those with destiny’s grace.
Through lattice windows, light filters like jade’s essence,
At the door, gusts scatter shadows—golden lotus in flight.
Fragrant mist fills the hall, the spirit’s waves converge,
A pearl of clarity lifted to the azure sky.

**Dawn Awakening**
I seek the original source—its truth is self-evident,
Release its radiance to extinguish all passions.
The Three *Treasures* now pierce through *Right Awareness*,
One mind—why fear it not attain *Perfect Enlightenment*?
Mastering subtle applications, clarity’s depths are known,
Recognizing profound mysteries, purity’s light is shown.
The mortal form dissolves as guest beyond the clouds,
On the Path of Eternal Life, I stride with steady tread.

**Strolling at Xingqing Pool**
With carefree step, I wander through Xingqing’s embrace,
Yet find it but these fleeting illusions’ trace.
Rain flips lotus leaves—pearls burst in splendor,
Wind rolls bamboo tips—jewels cling to branches.
Spring’s verdant green, summer’s crimson lotus bloom,
Autumn’s chill clarity, winter’s jade-like gem.
Through jade’s transparent depths, the source is sought,
But asking of its flow—none know its path.

**At the Zen Gate: The First Rain’s Invitation**
To seek the formless, first distinguish east and west,
To pierce the mundane, see all as one.
On Snowy Peak, I search for *Right Awareness*,
On Crimson Cliffs, I play with emptiness.
These messages are wrapped in spring’s light,
These causes hidden in the moon’s reflection.
Do not cling to the courtyard’s pine’s shadow,
Your true nature is your own ancestral wind.

**The Old Monk on Life and Death**
All my life, I’ve grasped the *Great Vehicle’s* truth,
In harmony with jade’s tones and gold’s voice.
On the path of *Right Awareness*, I climb the lofty ridge,
Toward *Bodhi*, I step beyond the mortal slope.
With wisdom’s fruit, I taste the white lotus’s bloom,
My true nature soars past the *Sacred Tree’s* bough.
From this point, no birth nor death shall bind,
Fixed in *Prajñā* and *Bodhisattva*’s light.

**A Virtuous Friend Asks of Cultivation and the Dao**
Do not entangle yourself in worldly affairs,
For *Qinglián*—purity—begins with stillness.
With wisdom’s lamp, I often prune and polish,
In the heart’s field, I daily till and weed.
Let not the incense of fortune ever fade,
Cut down the thorns of vexation—clear the path.
When the seeds of *Lingyīng* flourish, the work is done,
Carry them forth to offer at *Potalaka’s* gate.

**Master Su Seeks Resignation from Office**
All speak of *Qinglián*—purity’s ease,
Yet none but the *Penglai* Sage attain it.
Beyond the *Wuji*, clouds and mists are my companions,
In half the sky, wind and moon my causes.
To master *Miaoyuan*—effortless transcendence,
Wisdom must shift as swiftly as it flows.
The Master sheds his mortal form,
And here, we speak of years beyond time.

**The Dream**
In joyful play, the outer world draws near,
Yet in the midnight slumber, truth reveals itself clear.
The Seven *Po* spirits dance with demons’ guile,
The Three *Shi* delight in draining life’s vital tide.
The mind-monkey is bound—no defilement clings,
The thought-horse is captured—no nocturnal wanderings.
The four false forms trade in daylight’s fleeting market,
Yet in truth, how different from those who sleep in darkness?

**Master Lü Asks for a *Gold Justified* Verse from the *Diamond Sutra***
The *Diamond Sutra’s* first four lines begin with *Mahā*,
Then seek the six-character hymn’s pure path.
With wisdom’s blade, I sever *Prajñā*’s veil,
To cross the shore and prove *Bodhisattva*’s worth.
To know the heart, to see true nature—this is *Perfect Enlightenment*,
To grasp the *Mercury* and *Lead* of alchemy’s art—*Mìdū*’s sweetness revealed.
From this core, the *orthodox* meaning is found,
Ascending to the *Pure Realm*, leaving *Sahā*’s dust behind.

**Master Yu Asks of Master Su’s Childhood Abstinence**
This cause lies not in mortal feasts,
Nor in fasting’s guise to shape the face.
To nourish *qi*, I drink the elixir’s essence,
To sustain the spirit, I rest like clouds at ease.
When cultivation’s merit fills the measure,
The *Mercury* and *Lead* unite—this world is left behind.
Only when the outer dross is purged away,
Shall radiance return in its full, eternal round.

**On *Qinglián* (Purity and Tranquility)**
Let not the mind’s clarity be strained by turmoil,
On nature’s stillness, raise the wisdom’s blade.
Crush the dust of red passions—find what’s truly gained,
Split the void of black ignorance—know the potter’s wheel.
Through peaks, the moon’s light is my companion,
Beyond ridges, lone clouds are my kin.
As neighbors in retreat, we part in joy,
To wander the Three Isles, seeking peaches of immortality.

**A Layman Jokes of Stealing My Feet**
Fortunate indeed to meet a *Count of My Native Land*,
Would I dare steal your feet to add to my own?
You’ve not yet suffered the Three *Poisons’* anguish,
I’ve already escaped the *Nine Abysses’* bond.
My heart is like the moon—bright and boundless,
My nature flows with *Dao*—pure and unfettered.
Though short my step, long strides shall soon be mine,
And teach the *Eastern Sea’s* soul to circle the world.

**The Inspector of Yandu Asks of Eternal Life**
Your Excellency’s loyalty shines in your question,
Yet even now, the hour’s struck—one toll to reckon.
The five *qi* are clear, their cycles marked,
The *Jia* and *Gēng* days reversed—refine the Three *Péng*.
I seek the golden vessel of ancient lore,
To emerge from the fiery furnace of this age’s test.
Now grasp the *Penglai’s* true path,
And sit firm on *Youtai*—sipping jade wine with zest.

**Master Song Asks of Cultivation**
Polish the mind’s core—let wisdom flow,
And from its depths, jade blossoms shall grow.
In the Three *Fields*, treasures rare await the morning dew,
A single grain of cinnabar withers as the twilight’s hue.
Its crimson glow fades to pale mist,
Its radiance shifts—from white to fiery red.

**The Essence of the Dao: Formless and Void**

From the void’s true display of empty form,
Empty wrapped in emptiness—its nature, void’s own norm.
**Cultivation**—this path so hard to trace,
Turns out to be but the mind’s true, boundless grace.

The crimson-clad noble roams the hills and streams,
The black-hatted sage dives into the furnace’s gleam.
When the white steed snorts, gold echoes in its cry,
Where the green ox plows, jade’s luster never dies.
Heaven-high pillars, earth-rooted radiance gleam,
The *Dragon Embrace* and *Terhapa*’s smallest flame.

Great alchemy’s path knows no end to refinement,
The *Cold Furnace*’s folly belongs to my kin.
Pure winds veil the face—*True Qi*’s breath,
Bright moon’s glow reveals the *Cinnabar*’s wealth.
Ever check the old form, ever polish anew,
And pluck fresh likeness from the void’s hue.

A single spark cast into the azure sky,
Pierces the void—its image begins to rise.
Dragon’s roar stirs the tiger’s wrath,
Snow-waves and winds swirl, tossing in wrath.
Purifying one soul, adding to its glow,
Harmonizing two *qi*—their union does bestow.

The tortoise strides through the waves’ play,
The crimson phoenix alights on the peak’s sway.
One bright moon wheel, its light so grand,
Illuminates the *Sanmao*’s peak, where it stands.
Since first I’ve glimpsed the Dao’s true face,
Today I know the old self’s embrace.

Detached from the world, a guest of the clouds,
Free from the dust, no earthly bounds.
For once I’ve seized the *Cinnabar*’s core,
It’s all been the *Mercury*’s lore.

A spark of clarity returns to the still,
A rounded light wraps the face—*Golden Wheel*’s thrill.
The *Mysterious Pass*’s secret I’ve claimed,
Refined for *Chongyang*—all darkness tamed.

From now on, flames multiply on the wood,
And gold is boiled in the river’s flood.
What god responds to these wonders seen?
One *True Soul*—its awe is mine.

Gathered as form, dispersed as *qi*,
In clear skies, it travels—eternally free.
The *Fetal Immortal* dances, becoming divine,
All from the right path, the ancient design.

Why circle the *Dan Field* with gold and tiger’s might?
No need for the *Treasure Cauldron*—let the dragon ignite.
Scold the *Lead-Mercury* pair—calm is their due,
Swap *Yin-Yang*—they’ll grow ever anew.

A streak of red dawn on the mountain’s crest,
The returning light shines on the *Azure Crane*’s nest.
Clouds severed, the moon’s radiance is clear,
The *Divine Vessel* glides beside the shore’s sheer.

When water and fire meet, the path opens wide,
Wood and gold parted—eternal life’s guide.
*Lead* black, *Mercury* red—south and north divide,
*White Tiger* and *Green Dragon* shift with *Jia* and *Geng*’s stride.

Hold fast to this method—its truth is refined,
In the void, a *Jade Silk Pavilion* defined.
Since the light’s clear, no need for search’s toil,
No petty debate on shallow or deep—avoil.

Seated true, the *Child of Midday*’s seen,
The *Ding-Ren*’s head reveals the path’s keen.
Five hues in steps, one *Dao Mystery*’s tide,
Grasp the void’s marvel—let it be your guide.

Inhale and exhale, subtle and fine,
Nurture the *Pearl*—its origin divine.
*Mother-Child*’s pair follow, hues intertwined,
*Qi* and *Spirit* converge—lights uniquely aligned.

Upside-down union, secrets revealed,
Top and bottom’s clash—*Pivot Axis*’s healed.
To the deep mountain’s highest peak,
Alone, I bloom—*Moon Wheel*’s sleek.

From the start, I’ve learned to twist the winds,
Scatter them in the *Yao Pool*—*Jade Lotus*’s seeds.
One branch grows, its brilliance unmatched,
Five leaves unfurl—each perfect, each matched.

Once I’ve seen the Dao’s profound art,
Now I know its natural heart.
No longer bound by the four seasons’ rush,
In *Eternal Spring*’s realm, years lose their crush.

Cultivate with the *Nine Suns*’ chart,
Know the *Suns*’ lore—all things shall part.
The wise shall transcend the *造化*’s* fate,
The fool wastes effort—his toil’s in vain.

Gained, it’s seen through—void within has form,
Completed, how’s it like—form within the void’s norm?
Void has form, form has void, void’s no void,
Form’s within void—*Heaven’s Path*’s employed.

Know the hand’s start—avoid the *Three Realms*’’ snare,
Scold the past self—this mortal’s affair.
Into the fire, dare to dive and blaze,
Cross the river—no need to drown or sway.

At noon, the *Essence*’s brilliance gleams,
In the moon’s embrace, the *Jade Forest*’s dreams.
This *Great Cinnabar* returns to the world’s beyond,
Free and unfettered—its journey’s unbound.

**The Eternal Student of the Dao**
Empty boasts of cultivation—what’s ever been?
Only to show off before men’s eyes, then.

Hard to grasp the scholar’s void, yet they fear the test,
Unfamiliar with the *Buddha’s Path*—they scorn the quest.
Amidst wealth and desires, they seek to rise,
In wine and flesh’s depths, they hope to prize.

In the world, no sin’s ever been,
Yet Dao’s pursuit adds burdens ten.
Keep the heart upright—no evil’s bred,
The *Three Teachings*’ truths merge as one thread.

When principles shine, what’s left to differ?
After *Mystic Dao*’s grasp, no need to stir.
All things are set aside, pure and clear,
The *Eternal Person*’s rebirth draws near.

Truly longing for the Dao’s way,
No ties remain—my body stays.
In stillness, stillness grows—its grace refined,
In leisure, leisure’s peak—no need to find.

Then I’ll act free, yet know peace’s art,
Days pass with coolness, wisdom’s my part.
No need to seek the *Immortal’s* lot,
Just sit on the *White Flower Lotus*—my spot.

Last year in *Ninghai*’s army I stayed,
This year in *Wéndēng*’s county I roamed.
Two years past, cold to warmth’s sway,
Two seasons through—darkness to light’s play.

This reversal, who else understands?
This *Yin-Yang*’s shift—I alone command.
A single ounce of true gold emerges bright,
No need to forge—it’s already right.

Like this, know the Dao’s outer hold,
The heart and spirit—your guides, your gold.
Ancient cases must be sought and found,
Your own *Dao Wind*—let it be unbound.

Refined, the *Awakened Mind*’s clear,
Filled, the *Old Compassion*’s sheer.
Compassion and purity stand side by side,
Sudden enlightenment—no things can bind.

Know the *Heart’s Flower*—it breeds the wind,
*Mercury-Lead*’s secrets, pure and refined.
Within the *Three Thousand*, use the *Thousand Dawn*’s law,
In ten years’ span, pass the *Nine Transformations*’ flaw.

Hues layered, white’s purity spread,
A single light—red’s brilliance shed.
Void’s reflection returns to the void’s face,
Illuminating true void—void’s not empty space.

How many follow the stream’s flow?
I stand alone—fools’ company’s woe.
When hunger comes, I feast on *oyster rice*,
Cold returns—I wear coarse clothes, no vice.

Poetry cannot split the profound subtlety,
The heart’s *incense-scent* (*xīnsū*) hard to discern.

Not only must one guard it when gained,
But return it to its source—no taxing claim.

**A Tea Ode (1–7 characters per line)**
Tea, tea.
Jade cups, gem buds.
Born of void wisdom, blooming void splendor.
Clears the spirit’s *qi*, summons clouds and mist.
Precisely my heart’s affair—
Do not boast of worldly tastes.

One cup stirs Li Bai’s joy,
Seven bowls belong to Lu Quan’s kin.
Only gold can brew jade buds,
Releasing *golden blossoms* through the strainer.

---
**Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.**
Filthy lips, foul mouth.
Dulls the nature, dulls the spirit.
Diminishes true *qi*, erodes lifespan’s thread.
Half-drunk, the gut aches with sorrow;
Drunk deep, the mind collapses.
To oneself, it invites reckless rage;
To others, no shame remains.
Better never drink—eternally awake,
No harm, no calamity—cultivate the *Nine Nines*.

---
**Desire, desire, desire.**
Brings misfortune, drains virtue.
Diminishes *jin* essence, harms *yè* fluid.
Shatters *qi* and spirit, ruins benevolence.
Can leave the *Three Fields* barren,
Confuse the *Five Viscera*.
Extinguishes the luminous soul,
Exhausts the limbs’ sinew and strength.
Better abstain—enduringly boundless,
No harm, no calamity—eternally flourishing.

---
**Wealth, wealth, wealth.**
Sows sin, acts as matchmaker.
Buys desire, invites the cup.
Further corrupts virtue, invites disaster.
Accumulates the *Three Realms’* suffering,
Makes escape from *Nine Abysses* hard.
Though it swells the family’s fortune,
How can one avoid *samsara*’s wheel?
Better not seek it—constantly content,
No harm, no calamity—ever abundant.

---
**Qi, qi.**

**Qi, qi.**

Destroys the spirit, harms the stomach.
Summons **xīng** (猩) and **líng** (狞)—how foul the taste!
Seven orifices still unobstructed,
Two eyes bright as boiling water.
Dao/Way’s sentiment cannot be turned,
The king’s law—who dares to fear?
Street after street, the **lǚo** (偻罗) vie for victory,
Contesting strength only brings dissipation and waste.
Better not indulge—then all is well,
No harm, no calamity—all is noble and refined.

---
**Seven-line Long Poem: Praising Alcohol**
Cloud-friends and mist-companions always draw near,
Smooth and spicy light nourishes **qi** and spirit.
A full hall discusses the three teachings’ lore,
One cup spreads the freshness of four seasons’ spring.
If you know the scene at the **Zìzài** (自在) Pavilion,
Then you are the **xiāoyáo** (逍遥) one beyond worldly ties.
Silent and drunken, the wind is my companion,
Dark and deep, the moon is my neighbor.
Fragrant vapors swirl through empty space,
Emerald mists layer above and below.
Pure and serene—no thought of life’s affections,
When drunk, I dance in sleeves, seeking truth’s embrace.

---
**Hall of Full Truth**
Its name resounds—**Quánzhēn** (全真)!
**Jìzhèng** (寂正) and **xiāoyáo** (逍遥) expound its essence.
Why use grass huts to shield from rain and dew?
Nor need I dwell in tiled roofs to pass the autumn and spring.
A single idle abode is hard to find,
Yet my **sān jiǎ** (三假) mortal form is its cause.
Ever built, ever maintained, it rests upon the earth,
Sleep and wake—never leaving my body.
Sometimes, after waking, my heart feels vast,
Each time I rouse, my love grows deeper.
**Qi** and blood flow without leakage,
Spirit and essence intertwine—endless and boundless.
The wisdom-lamp shines within, illuminating the **sān yào** (三曜),
Fortune bestows eternal life beyond the **liù chén** (六尘).
Here, the **Zìzài** (自在) Sage returns to the **Yuèdǐng** (岳顶),
Holding **zhīcǎo** (芝草) and stepping toward the **Lián guān** (莲官).
Tea-talk and broth-chatter are my **fēng gē** (风哥),
**Zhīcǎo** (芝草) idly shared—what fruit does it bear?
Do not boast before mortals,
Know that beyond things, laughter is sincere.

---
**The Red Dragon stirs the sea, adding to the fire of separation (离水),
The Purple Flame rests in the furnace, nurturing the **kǎn hé** (坎河).
The Wooden Horse can still follow the Water Tiger,
The Golden Master must wed the Yellow Mother (黄婆).
Mercury and lead have long been mingled—
Now sons and daughters are born in abundance.
Guests depart together, looking back at the crossing,
Teaching you to climb the high slope as well.

---
**Sharing Tea with the Venerable Long Elder**
The gathering is always Daoist/Sagely guests,
Today, celestial **língzhī** (灵芝) is obtained.
Only I recognize its roots when plucked,
No one knows its essence when ground.
Dust scatters—**qióngyáo** (琼瑶) fragrant beyond measure,
Broth pours—**xuělàng** (雪浪) white within.
My mind is clear, beyond life and death,
My **shuǎngqì** (爽气) scorns the narrowness of heaven and earth.
Seven cups of Dao/Way’s sentiment reveal old ties,
One sip of **chán wèi** (禅味) opens the heart’s special path.
Washing away delusion, attaining true emptiness,
From now on, no worldly dust shall intervene.

---
**In Harmony with the Venerable Jade Long Elder’s Ancient Tune**
Wisdom’s gaze is rooted in emptiness—no rise or fall,
Auspicious **qi** drifts faintly, opening distant peaks.
Here, the **Sānshān** (三山) guests often pass,
Birds of the **Jiǔgāo** (九皋) come and go with them.
The lofty towers coolly shower sweet rain,
Washing away all worldly dust’s intrusion.
Divine water surges through the **Zǐjīn kū** (紫金窟),
The luminous **bǎodòng** (宝洞) is even more profound.
Before the cave, ancient **gǔwú** (古梧) trees stand verdant,
Like the **chán** (蟾) in the moon’s deep forest.
Beneath the tree, the **jiānzǔ** (间祖) Sage from the West arrives,
Silent, he lifts his sleeves, seeking no reply.
Now that we’ve mutually understood,
Within **dìng** (定), we search for the **tí** (提) and **qǔ** (裾襟).
Bodyless, actionless—no leakage,
Whether full or empty, the belly’s not concerned.
Teach you to grasp this truth—
The **bā mài** (八脉) infant wrapped in brocade.
Who can make the **tāixiān** (胎仙) dance?
Only I, with the **sān diē** (三迭) **xīn qín** (心琴).

**Five-line Regulated Verse: Early Morning Walk**

**Early Morning Walk**
*(Five-line Regulated Verse)*

---

**True Guest of the True Interval**
A traveler on the straight path ahead,
The road ahead now clear and wide.
No darkness lingers in the long journey’s night,
Swift steps take me east or west at will.
Who knows the moon’s midnight glow?
Only I, the wind’s lone whisper.

For the Assembly of Equal Worth,
I seek no gain nor name’s renown.

---
**Ode to Ninghai Military Garrison**
Ninghai’s garrison—wealth in emptiness,
Where Daoist riches overflow.
Mountain-drinking light, water’s height—
Near water, high the spirit soars.
Fine fare nourishes the taste,
The virtuous meet their fate.

Returning light reflects the dawn,
Together we feast on peach of immortality.

---
**Clarity in Practice**
A wisdom-sword swings through the void,
Its radiance piercing boundless space.
The *Mawǎn* scrolls are slashed away,
The lotus of the watery realm is cut.
The Rabbit’s garden blooms with gold,
The Rooster’s hall unfolds jade.

Yellow brilliance, white radiance shine—
This is **Pílú**’s luminous form.

---
**Visiting the Fragrant Severity Temple**
The bell’s metallic roar resounds,
Fish-sounds heard through wooden tones.
Fire-essence incense guides the way,
Water-dwelling treasures fill the vase.

Who grasps the Four Affairs’ truth?
The Three Vehicles’ teachings shine ever clearer.
To fathom this profound mystery—
Is to attain **Round Perfection**.

---
**The Pure Monk Seeks Practice**
With **Amitābha**’s vow in mind,
Cool breezes stir the heart’s repose.
The Three **Yào** must radiate bright,
The Six **Bōluó** must be known.

**Prajñā** ever reveals itself,
**Bodhi** ever draws near.
True **Suchness** calls for awakening—
Joy erupts from **Sahā**’s world.

---
**Self-Reflection**
A single gate of virtue stands,
Guarded by its own good will.
Gold boys bear jade locks,
Jade maidens hold golden spoons.
Closed, none see within—
Opened, only I know well.

Ever shouldered by **Pì**,
In and out through **Zǐlíngzhī**’s glade.
To see **Bodhi**’s face,
One must know **Mìduō**’s way.

The Three **Zàng**’s treasure bound,
The Six **Bōluó** revealed.
All things lack heads or sense,
Each form has roots unseen.

**Jièrán**’s insight breaks free,
Jade nectar moistens gold’s tide.
Qi surges, spirit clears—
Mind at ease, nature serene.

Palaces distill jade nectar,
Double gates forge gold elixir.
Clarity through the Three Paths,
Roundness in a single sphere.
No lack of crimson flames,
Purple light converges here.
This is the root—
Divine light demands sincerity.

Beyond all worldly scenes,
Extinguish all worldly ties.
The Four Seasons breathe the Middle **Qi**,
The Three Lights shine above.

If **Preverted Law** is mastered,
What fear of **Round Perfection**’s lack?
The Dao lies in nature’s length,
The body frets, yet not the heart.

Yellow shoots spread earth-wide,
White snow blankets the garden’s end.
The **Chāinǚ** delights in joy,
The infant laughs with boundless ease.

The **Dāoguī**’s first method stands—
Beyond this, what more to seek?
To walk the Path of Practice,
First ascend the Treasure Platform.

Gazing upward, beyond all bounds,
Looking down, the Wheel of Rebirth is freed.
Pure essence manifests,
Pearl-like wisdom eyes unfold.
Only through **Preverted Law** can one
Turn back the inverted way.

---
**Five-Character Long Poem**
**To the Governor of Shangzhou**
Along the **Pénglái** path you tread,
Jú’s wife’s joy now spreads.
Your carriage rolls with virtuous rain,
Your fan stirs the wind of grace.
Noble banners lead the way,
Ten thousand steeds charge bold.
Planting **Cháng** as **Zhào Bó** did,
Cultivating virtue like **Wén Wǒng**’s art.
Governance shines with luminous light,
Words and nature merge as one.
Ascending to the **Huái** hall’s seat,
Your heart aligns with mine.

---
**Self-Reflection**
The **Sìfù**’s deeds are done,
The **Sānzǔ**’s harm is third.
A glance back—where I’ve been—
I recognize my former dullness.
The True Dao’s eye now opens wide,
Leaping free from **Sìfēi**’s gate.
Already a guest of the void,
Why linger as earth’s lost soul?

Three sacred peaks stand tall,
Four seasons’ warmth enfolds.
All things are **non-being**,
Non-being—do not debate.
Eyes blind, ears deaf—
No voice, no sound penetrates.

Urge them to cease their **Chàngyù** song,
Ask them why they stir the wind.
If not revering sages’ worth,
Why court the harm of fate’s design?

All things are delusion’s play,
All forms are empty air.
Wife and daughter—iron of a thousand *jīn*,
Sons and grands—copper of ten thousand *dàn*.
How do they know of darkness’ grip,
Yet still chase after crimson glow?
Evil deeds accumulate,
Good roots find no shelter here.
Boasting of the body’s strength,
The heart drifts like a floating reed.
How few know their primal source,
How few recall their ancestors’ way.
Would they fret over earthly graves,
Or speak of heaven’s halls?
Only greed for wealth and desire,
Blindness to all wisdom’s light.
If walking the Path of Equal Worth,
One stumbles into **Wǔhuā**’s snare.

**Seven-Character Long Poem (Hidden Head)**
**Continuing to Gift to Master Wáng Zǐróng of the Capital**
[...] This **Huá** lineage, **Zǐróng**’s name,
[...] With elegance, we walk the same.
[...] Silk brocade veils the dust of mundane things,
[...] Horses, pigs, and sheep—worldly beasts’ kin.
[...] Nine **tiáo** escape the door’s hold,
[...] Three **gè** flee the chest’s weight.
[...] Born with a jade tablet bright,
[...] A **dānhuán** bolsters the kidney’s root.
[...] If ancestors knew the craft of transformation,
[...] Spirits would soon grasp **Héyōng**’s truth.
[...] Do not cling to realms beyond three,
[...] Seek not peaks above two’s height.
[...] Kunlun’s summit now appears,
[...] Linwū’s cave-heavens sealed.
[...] Light returns to the primal way,
[...] Below, the **Yùzhōng** may strike.

「A single grain of gold elixir—none recognize it,
A lifetime’s essence and vitality—who could ever guess it?

**To Master Siwu (Four Mulberry)**

The recluse of Seven Pines abandons worldly dust,
The Five Willows Master sheds all clinging ties.
When the magistrate’s fame shall come to fruition,
He may yet call you, Master of Four Mulberry.

Four mulberry trees stand in astonished wonder,
Two broomrape blossoms laugh as if in anger.
Long seated, the cool breeze summons me—
This night, I’ll dwell beside the moon as neighbor.

**To Dong Defu**

In leisure, I wander, seeking the True—
Cold detachment, pure void, my host.
Your radiant鬓 still boast their former glory,
Yet Defu still treads the crimson dust.

**To Master Du of Jingzhao**

Do not speak of white snow or yellow buds,
Nor of lead, silver, or cinnabar.
Ask Master Du of the Great Dao—
Does Kunlun Mountain belong to whom?

**To Monk Dingyuan of Liu Jiangcun**

Jade-named Pal

The fool who laughs at life’s blind snare,
All claim to nurture family’s care.
Yet family’s but a fire to burn the flesh,
Drying clay—when gone, but dust it is.

Now I would counsel those lost in dust:
Seek the Dao’s fruit, the true cause.
A spark of insight—then you’ll see:
Before the wind, you’re but a heap of dust.

The Yang should not cling to Yin’s embrace,
For Yin will mar your virtue’s base.
Refine pure Yang—seven treasures born,
On the Path of No-Birth, no dust is sworn.

At leisure, I sit, watching common men,
Each digging paths where none are then.
Like fish that cling to water’s flow,
They know not dust—yet sink in dust below.

In this world’s wheel, all turn and turn,
Each soul’s nature, each cause is earned.
A hundred years—from womb to dust,
The Five Aggregates return to dust.

Steady the Azure Ox, as ancient sages did,
The White Ox’s branch—its root is hid.
Confucius, the Physician, three teachings blend,
Till fools awaken lest they sink to dust again.

Born and die—ten thousand souls pass through,
Good fruit and cause between the two.
Jealousy, greed, pride in wealth and rank—
I walk apart, beyond your dusty bank.

Who knows the man within the market’s throng?
Do-nothing, act-nothing—let fate belong.
White clouds guide me, wind and moon my kin,
Free of toil, I leave the world’s dust behind.

Men come and go, each watching each,
Hearts calculating, each with cause to preach.
Three Lights shine clear beyond the dust’s veil,
Revealing form—yet all is dust’s pale tale.

**Reflections on the Water Cloud**

I wandered west to lands afar,
Found true gold—firm, unyielding star.
Sealed in the Vermilion Palace bright,
Its glow illuminates, bathed in crimson light.

The Golden Elixir forms in instant grace,
No need for three years, nine transformations’ chase.
If peers could grasp this truth before the rest,
In Spicy Cloud’s depths, their path is blessed.

Alone before the peak’s true face,
Jade blossoms, fair flowers—scenery’s embrace.
One grain of gold becomes the great elixir’s core,
No further need—no need to boil, no more.

Mysteries profound, yet simple to discern,
Silent stillness holds the truth to learn.
Search out the truth from time’s first spark,
No south, no north—no east, no dark.

Master the true elixir by its name,
Uncover subtle truths—growth will claim.
From then, the tortoise dives into the sea’s blue,
Fire peaks rejoice—Jú Láng’s joy anew.

A true treasure’s light begins to glow,
Four Symbols yield to Yang’s pure flow.
Five-leafed golden lotus blooms in splendor wide,
Ten thousand threads of jade unfold with pride.

Before noon, after child—now clash they meet,
Seizing golden essence, victory’s feat.
A mortal head falls swift beneath the blade,
Lifted high—joy to Ding Gong’s aid.

One golden lotus blooms from birth’s first dawn,
Only the sage’s eye may guess its dawn.
Draw in its scent, take it as your feast,
Merge the Two Qi—conception’s feast.

Ten thousand spirits, sharp and keen,
Defeat a thousand evils—no need for a guest.
Alone, its light shines bright as day’s own glow,
Now known—this place holds pearls of show.

On Jade Peak, I pluck the spirit mushroom fair,
Vital qi and spirit—rooted there.
One point of light, yet radiant bright,
Five hues of mist entwine in pure delight.

In stillness, pierce the Five Phases’ cause,
Thus cast off the Four False forms’ embrace.
Return to origin—true face revealed,
White clouds ride steady—one immortal steeled.

The Four False forms now guests to me,
The True within—my ancient kin.
Alone on Three Peaks, who shares my seat?
Clear wind and moon—my three companions meet.

Who dares wield sword or spear with pride?
Dragon and tiger clash—yet I stand defied.
Seizing the Light-Pearl, one bright gleam,
Dissolves the frost of nine cold winters’ dream.

Beneath White Cloud Hall, the night grows deep,
Fine rain and bells—golden drops weep.
Drink deep from Penglai’s cup, I sing,
Slow, the phoenix flute’s sad, sweet ring.

In practice, first discern what’s true, what’s false,
South, north, east, west—all paths compose.
Water, fire, wood, metal—none need be,
One Light-Pearl gleams from the center’s key.

Inner vision finds its kindred soul,
On Moonlit Peak, I sing at will.
Ten thousand verses—who can fathom?
If understood, the heart grows still.

The Purple Spirit Mushroom’s shell first sprouts,
Plucked, then boiled—its virtue brooks.
Jade nectar, fair wine—now mixed with grace,
Swallowed whole—eternal life’s embrace.

Since I’ve won gold from water’s deep,
I’ve used the knife to sever all that’s steep.
One jade flower blooms toward the sun’s bright face,
Crystalline Yang reflects the Heaven’s place.

The Horse-Ape’s caught—now practice’s done,
All things perish—none are born, none run.
Would you strike the drum on painted towers high?
At dawn, why ring the metal’s chime so nigh?

If you would master the elixir’s art,
Preserve the true spirit—keep it whole and pure.
Look upon Kunlun’s mountain’s grand display,
Spicy Cloud’s glow meets Qin’s vast way.

Surname Wang, given name Zhé, style Ming,
Dao name Chongyang—four flavors sing.
One nature easily harmed by wind’s deceit,
A thousand gold won’t buy a high sleep’s retreat.

Now I’ve torn the net of iron true,
Today I leap from dust’s confining hue.
With bright moon’s light, I play my part,
Scattering clouds—good sport to mar the wind’s art.

Mysteries deep, yet logic’s thread is spun,
Frost of silver’s gone—my heart’s undone.
Ride the Iron Ox to plow the Steward’s land,
In every plot, gold grains take their stand.

Do not covet rebirth’s fleeting shell,
Plant in the Jade Pool—let roots compel.
A white lotus blooms, its scent so clear,
Pierces the Heaven’s heights—no need to fear.

True cultivation’s ease, not hard to know,
Dao’s use in observing Heaven’s flow.
Claim the Two Peaks’ true, boundless realm,
Wang’s flower’s core—its cause is warm.

Within the Jade Pool, yellow buds unfold,
Jade petals, gold branches—flowers of gold.
Each bloom, clear and bright, its qi ascends,
Chimes and bells—our family’s ends.

A lifetime’s purity nourishes the Three Fields,
Now stillness may be rightly heeded.
The bright pearl returns to the mountain’s crest,
Clouds and mists bear it to the Great Dao’s rest.

Though you seek echoes beyond the void,
Or chase the bubbles in the water’s ploy,
A thousand schemes, a hundred turns of fate—
How can you escape this final state?

Do not become a ghost in your hometown’s dust,
Soon I’ll return—a celestial guest.

This natural knows its own retreat—no need to search,
That subtle essence, then, must be studied with care.
Call forth the Primordial Child to examine closely,
Luminous and refined, the Purple-Gold Elixir forms.

Bright and flawless, its marvels none can compare,
Five paths’ radiance gathered as one.
Clothed in white linen, it struggles in water’s embrace,
Or wrapped in green silk, it marches through flames.

Four flavors blend into one, everlasting and sweet,
Endless life is thus attained.
Only those who know how to nurture the Purple-Gold Elixir,
Refine it into a pearl—then will it not be hard.

Its light shines forth, ever more splendid,
All hues of the cosmos gathered at once.
Jade nectar flows, yet none may recognize,
Pearl broth surges, yet who can know its source?

Now I alone irrigate the Golden Flower Tree,
Its fragrant scent fills the Four Quarters.
Only I can eat the flesh of the Azure Crane,
Only I can feast on the White Horse’s liver.

Two stages merge into one, all else falls away,
Onlookers shrink in fear at the sight.
Suddenly seizing this Primordial Essence,
Illusion dissolves—its nature is not mine.

One radiant light, utterly clear,
Five colors vibrant, as I will.
Mercury and lead meet on the long road,
Life and vitality forever secure.

Stirring the water and fire’s vital breath,
Parting the smoke and flames to point to the lake.
Sweet water quells the diagram’s chaos—
Who knows the harm of the **Harmful Wind** in the **Final Southern**?
The **Chang’an** streets hold no sway over West or East.

From time to time, I raise my head to the **Storied Seas**,
Reeling in the **Whale and Giant Turtle**—yet they are not the true heroes.

Again I know: **One Wheel of Moonlight, One Clear Wind**,
Inner and outer harmonize—West returns to East.
A single form emerges from **Kunlun’s** peak,
Shining bright, its breeze crisp—now it stands as the true hero.

**To Master Qiu Chuji**
Fine golden scales play in emerald currents,
Seeking fragrant bait, it swallows the hook.
Gently I reel in its luminous threads,
Dragging it to **Penglai’s** eternal freedom.

**To Master Sang’s Son**
Master Sang’s accumulated virtue is profound and vast,
This child of his understands all matters.
Slightly awakened to inner joy, not external delight,
He seeks the moonlight, playing with the clear wind.

**To Master Tang Gong on Seeking the Dao**
True cultivation must not follow worldly desires,
For following them, the Dao cannot be realized.
Serving the same current as others, yet none awaken—
Only when the heart truly understands is the path revealed.

Seeking the Dao and refining the True Nature is no hasty affair,
Ever sweeping the heart-field clear.
Awakening to transcendence lies in severing dusty attachments,
If Heaven had sentiment, Heaven too would age.

**To the Scholars**
All you gentlemen here possess noble talent,
Both sharp and bright, your Dao-eyes open wide.
Do not be ensnared by fame and gain,
Instead, follow me to **Penglai’s** gate.

**To Ninghai Begging for Paper and Banners**
The **Harmful Wind**’s man asks what proof he has,
All techniques and methods are useless—he cannot.
Daily deeds are but this alone:
Eat above, ascend below.

**To Master Ma Yu of Dengzhou**
Speak of the Moon’s brilliance, its light radiant,
Fragrance from the **Cassia Tree** spreads nineteen branches.
At the **Midnight Hour**, when the **True North** aligns,
Unleash its spirit-luster to illuminate the **Jade Pool**.

**To Master Ma Yu**
Master, you once wrote this poem in **Shaanxi**,
When you reached **Ninghai’s** military encampment,
We met for the first time—now I inscribe your name again as a gift.
One farewell at **Final Southern’s** **Water Bamboo Village**,
Your home lacks sons, daughters, or grandchildren.
A thousand leagues away, I seek my true friend,
Guiding you to the **Gate of Immortality**.

**Self-Portrait as a Skull**
This was the **Harmful Wind** of my past life,
Why does he now wander West and East?
Let him roam as a skull in the wilderness,
Free in the moonlit void, his true nature revealed.

**To Master Huang Ge**
Gather wisdom-grass and add broad oil,
A single bright lamp atop his head.
Illuminating the **Five Gates**, all paths are clear,
Teaching him to clap hands in endless joy.

**To Master Sun Ergong**
(No direct translation, as the name appears to be a title rather than a personal one.)

**To Master Sun Ergong**
Your Second Aunt is kin to my **Harmful Wind** household—
Once, the Master twice split a pear to share,
Feeding it to husband and wife, intending both to transform.
A year after my **taking the Way (出家奉道)**, Sun’s family also embraced the Dao.
The pear was split ten times for transformation last year—
The heavens granted a fine hour, the Master’s natural virtue.

Why did you not then **leave the home**?
Ah, you waited only for the **Golden Lotus (金莲)** to be bound.
At home, they called you merely "Second Aunt (二婆)",
But once outside, the **fire of home (家火)** was extinguished.
Leaping into white clouds, you transcended the **Sea of Suffering (苦海)**,
Now I call you **Xianma (仙姑)** in endless joy.

---

**The Impermanence Bell (无常钟)**
The bell rings not by time—yet those who hear it grieve.
They know the world must now **rest (休)**.
Its few chimes follow the setting sun,
Silent guests nod in wordless farewell.

---

**To Master Feng (冯先生)**
A hundred years of light and shadow pass without return—
Turn back, and you’ll see the **mist of illusion (迷蒙)**.
I teach you to recognize the **upside-down (颠倒)** in the scene,
To crush the dust of **mundane particles (微尘)** and trample **void (空)**.

---

**The Perfect Form (圆相)**
One perfect round form, I know it well—
At this hour, **Master Wang Zhe (王哲)** is right.
He emerges from the peak of **Kunlun Mountain (昆仑山)**,
Inviting **wind and moon (风月)** to the **Heavenly Pool (天池)**.

---

**The Weaver (织造人)**
The weaver who spins—what fate has he?
Before the street, he still plies his shuttle and loom.
If he were like me, a **free Daoist wanderer (逍遥客)**,
Would he still weave a thousand threads and endless strands?

---

**Snow (雪)**
The **Six Flowers (六花)** fall against my nature—
Drifting down, they crush **worldly affairs (是非)**.
The **Blue Cavern (碧洞)** warms in four seasons’ absence—
How could they dare to soil my **six-inch robe (六铢衣)**?

---

**Inscribed on Bamboo (题竹)**
They say you’re **elegant in the moonlight (潇洒)**,
But I know your **pure and clear nature (清虚本意)** is profound.
Had **Harmful Wind (害风)** not come here,
How could you be moved to **recite these verses (引动君吟)**?

---

**Inscribed on the Moon Bay Tree at Pure Business Temple (题净业寺月桂)**
Who would plant this **moon bay tree (月桂)** in the earth?
How could it bear to open its blossoms to the **mundane and vulgar (尘凡)**?
I pluck a single branch in my hand,
Then take the **celestial seed (仙种)** to **Penglai (蓬莱)**.

「终南山重阳子王哲撰 词 黄莺儿」
*Composed by Chongyangzi Wang Zhe of Zhongnan Mountain*
*Lyrics to the tune of "Huang Ying Er"*

How lamentable is the floating world’s way of passing through!
Wine and lust entangle like vines,
Wealth and **qi** sink deep like buried treasure—
All mortals follow these paths,
Four evils binding them tightly.

From high to higher rises their splendor,
Each step breeds deeper confusion.
All boast of cleverness and cunning,
Each strives to outwit the other—
All entangled in greed and jealousy.

From ancient times to modern,
How few turn back in time,
Willing to take **Dao** as their master.

Even if one follows the **monkeys and horses**,
Their schemes are ever in disarray—
No way to grasp the lineage of the ancestors.

Only by turning into the barren cliffs,
By plunging into the depths of the earth,
Does one await the final hour’s approach—
Yet still cannot escape the Three **Avīci**’s torments.

The heart’s true nature is the master of cultivation.
Refine the **golden elixir** (金丹),
Let the **essence and fluids** (津液) flow and merge,
Pouring over the rootless—
Nurturing the **jewel-tree** (琼树) with sprouts.

Ever watering the **jade-branches** (瑶枝),
Whispering through the dense leaves—
The **Huang Ying**’s melodious voice.

The **resplendent and refined** (莹灵) sounds and tones,
The bright eyes gazing—
Now the **baby** rides the **Tiger** (骑虎),
The **Fu** phase (兑方) has arrived.

How wondrous—
The **maiden** astride the **Azure Dragon** (青龙),
Four souls united in departure.

From the **original essence** (元初),
First attained—**stillness** (静) wraps **radiance** (辉),
The **returning light** (回光) makes the **embryonic immortal** (胎仙) dance.

It should emerge, manifesting on **Kunlun**,
Restoring the **Penglai** abode.

I do not presume to fancy clouds and mist,
For the **luan and he** birds (鸾鹤) come naturally.

The **flower-heart stirs**—
Lock tight the **heart-monkey** (心猿),
Awaken to the **light** (光) of time—
The dusty, mortal span is left behind.

Begin cultivation with decisive action,
Return to the **original essence** (元本),
This day to discard the **corporeal prison** (骸屋).

First leap from the **domestic pit and trench** (坑堑),
Then abandon the body—
Alone, one finds the **host** (孤宿).

In **stillness** without disturbance,
**Qi**, wealth, lust, and wine—
All swept away, utterly expelled.

The **mundane sights** (俗景) vanish one by one,
Desire extinguished.

One must forsake even **parents, spouse, and kin** (爷娘共妻骨肉),
To attain **freedom** (自在) and **ease** (逍遥),
Falling into **detachment** (落魄) and **leisure** (清闲),
Recognizing the **jewel within the wrapped head** (裹头金玉).

The **jewel-petals** (琼英) and **jade-buds** (瑶蕊),
The **flower-heart stirs**—
Releasing fragrance to fill the air,
A scent of **auspicious radiance** (祥辉) clustering in the **Nine Curves** (九曲).

**Yutang Chun** (玉堂春)
Cultivation attained—
Swift paths open before one.

Both **child and parent phases** (子午) are transcended,
Why cling to **Zao and You** (卯酉)?

Only the **two treasures** (两珍) suffice—
The rest may be left to guard each other.

Let **lead and mercury** (铅汞) be guided to form the **sphere** (球).
Then the **elixir** (丹) is perfected—
All phases revealed, utterly transparent.

Align the **true wind** (真风),
Name spreads, undying.

Search out the **original essence** (元初),
Who else would be the true companion?
Only now does one know the **piercing truth** (彻头).

Again—
**Lock the door.** (锁门)

「Jade’s nature is true gold’s essence,
All may transform—**this is the Way**.

Jade nectar, gold **elixir**—
Ever welcoming, again and again.

Jade hare, gold crow—
Their luminous **qi** ranks second only to the sun.
Shining upon jade railings, sprouting jade shoots.

**Jade-buds**, gold stalks—
Ever flourishing, never withering.
Jade maidens, gold boys—
Ever seen, yet never lingering.

Jade locks, gold keys—
Every door opens beneath.
Praise **Yutang Chun** and **Jade Flower** together.

There is a **Kingly Wind**—
Often sleeping, often resting.
No dreams, no wakefulness,
No calamities, no misfortunes.

White tiger, green dragon—
Naturally mating in harmony.
Water and fire meet—
Above and below, in perfect balance.
This **cause and effect**—
Truly the **original meditation** (打坐).
Let me ask all **adepts**—
Do you still recognize it?

Like me in **cultivation**,
Gain your **merit** through ** Daoic exchange**.
No need for toil, no need for suffering.

**Sudden Mountain Stream**
*A Gift to Magistrate Lu Shouqing of Wéndēng County*

Guard **purity**, guard **clarity**—
Each reveals their **true nature**.
Two by two in **Daoic practice**—
You, each one, reflect upon the heart.
**Void and substance**, **false and true**—
Wrap the face in warmth and coolness,
Seek **freedom**, find **ease**.
Gradually return to **meditative stillness**.
Teach and command—
Each must heed.

Swiftly climb the high slope,
Then steadily seek **the quickened path**.
**Mystic and profound**, **wondrous and subtle**—
Carefully discern the **Heavenly Way** (天衢),
Walk upright, stand firm.
Each step blooms **lotus in unison**.

---
Again—
*Seeking a Divine Tortoise Word from Master Yu*

**Tide and wave** surge boundless,
Pure and clear—**the source’s flow** unfolds.
Here hides the **Divine Tortoise**,
Daring to drink **all of Xi River’s waters**.

Sleep at will, rest as you please,
Breathing—**rarely heard**—
Mastering **qi**, swallowing **celestial vapors**,
At ease in endless play.
**Auspicious radiance**, **marvelous hues**—
Entering and emerging, **true omens** manifest.

Flames blaze fiercely,
Then walk **through the midst**, seizing **benefit**.
Burn and scorch at will,
Swiftly gather **coolness**—
Drag your tail, shake your head,
Alone upon the **white lotus’s core**.

---
**Riding Through the Imperial Avenue**
**Jade Herb**, a single **elixir**—
**Daoic communion** for **sages and worthies**.

**The Elixir of True Spirit-Nature**

This medicine cures **true spirit-nature**—
In the **void-mortar’s** steadfast array,
With **Diamond Pestle**, ground to **luminous essence**.
**Mahāprajñā** honey mixed in,
Refined until **pills** are formed.
**Great Compassion Thousand-Armed** elixir perfected,
**Sunfire** simmered—**cooked to completion**.
Best taken with **yellow sprouts**,
**Eight Immortal Waters** brewed pure.
From this moment, **eternal life** is attained—
**Everlasting success** secured.

**Flickering Candle Shadows**
Flickering candle shadows, red—
Darkly hanging **pearl-tears**, like whispered speech.
**Unfeeling things** stir no cause,
Yet turn my frequent **awakenings**.
Why fret, dear one?
**Today**, at **Zhongnan**, we meet.
Open your eyes, steady your mind,
Eastward to the **Jade Path**.
**True stillness**—**cloud-walking** through **celestial steps**.
At the **ocean’s edge**, our rendezvous awaits—
Here, we may dwell.
Awaiting **the Radiant Master**,
Unfolding **mysteries of eternal life’s gate**.
Wrapped in **rainbow light**,
**Penglai** reveals itself—
Together, we return.

**Eight-Voice Sweet State**
In the **cool realm’s** boundless expanse,
A world apart, a **unique Daoic lineage**.
Leisurely, leisurely—
**True sweetness**, **nectar’s** essence shared.
Washing **San Jiao**, **Six Fu**—
**Five Zang** now **crystal-clear**.
Flowing without stagnation,
**Inversion’s** paths all open.
**White qi** fills the abdomen—
**Aiding the primordial foundation**—
Only **deep exploration** suffices.
When **time’s clarity** arrives,
**East and West** become known.
Then you’ll know—
**Awakened forms**, such **lofty stature**,
**Circular perfection**, **radiance revealed**,
Forever dwelling in **clear skies**.

**Red Peony**
This **King** knows **clarity**,
Sees **chrysanthemum’s** steadfast virtue.
Thus named **Chóngyáng**—**Son of the Double-Nine**—
Now leaning close.
Often, he **weaves verses**,
**Pen without pause**, words naturally flow.
**Heart-incense** rises—
**Daoic scriptures** imprinted,
**Inversion’s** truths now clear.
**Early merit** seized,
**Deep mysteries** swiftly uncovered.
**Profound, profound, wondrous, wondrous**—
Endless **investigation**.
Again, **feasting on numinous herbs**,
**White qi** ascends—
**Fullness above and below**,
**Golden Elixir** forged as **treasure**.
At this time,
**Eternal life** secured—
Dwelling in **Ten Isles, Three Mountains**.

**Retaining the Guest**
But **mortals** must depart.

---

**Bound by a Hundred Years, the Seventy Difficult to Match**
**Seizing fame and contending for gain is futile and exhausting**—
**Gold flees, jade scatters, hastening old age and death,**
**Yet still dragged by brothers and grandchildren into the earth.**

Now I **awaken to truth**,
**Discarding clinging attachments and loves of this world,**
**Unburdened, I return.**

In **eternal wanderings through clouds and waters**,
**Leisurely freedom I now embrace.**

**Knowing mercury, understanding lead**,
**Qi full, essence fortified, spirit gathered**—
**The Golden Patriarch awaits,**
**The Yellow Mother pairs with him,**
**Nourishing infants, nurturing maidens.**
**Sufficient in skill and medicine.**

And again, **guest of Penglai**,
**Dwelling among the Highest Immortals.**

**Drunken River Moon (Chongyang)**
**The Ancestor of Zhengyang, the Pure Yang Master,**
**Practices profound and deep.**
**The True Patriarch is only my uncle,**
**Residing with the Sea Tortoise in the Three Isles.**

A disciple of Chongyang,
**Attending the Patriarch’s mysteries,**
**Holding numinous herbs in hand.**

**Returning to ultimate truth,**
**Within this, I favor the path of consumption and transformation.**
**Now self-sufficient and carefree,**
**The Golden Elixir transmitted—**
**A spark of luminous clarity, well attained.**

All **emanate from the profound and assist in rectitude,**
**Inherently pure, empty, yet inverted.**
**Returning to clear skies,**
**Residing in boundless void,**
**This matter must be realized.**

**When I depart from this world,**
**Think upon the time when you will know.**
**My original form,**
**Endowed with the essence of the Three Lights,**
**Now gathered whole.**

**Only self-sufficient can take form,**
**To occupy the gates of carefree wandering.**
**One luminous clarity—**
**Why did it fall?**
**Thrown into the mortal flesh,**
**Trading bone for profit, when will it rest?**

**Seizing the phantom body,**
**Honor and wealth—**
**None are truly firm.**

**Sudden awakening, as it is, after clinging bonds dissolve,**
**Deep gratitude to the True Master for His grace.**

**Secrets transmitted in person,**
**Followed through, now fully realized—**
**Success depends on fate’s encounter.**

**Cloud companions, mist friends,**
**All return to Penglai’s jade paths.**

**The Wandering Fish**
**Sighing at the skull, lying in this desolate wild.**
**Lone white bones, drifting free.**
**Who knows where this wandering self now roams,**
**Unable to distinguish true male or female?**
**Abandoned, cast aside.**

**It was from a past life without cultivation,**
**Only a fool like the monkey released.**
**This life, fallen low—**
**Blown by winds, drenched by rains,**
**Further struck by a careless herdsman.**
**I await only the search for cause,**
**Yet still, there is sorrow—**
**How can I speak?**

**Mud in mouth, sand in eyes,**
**Here, I wither and fade.**
**Endless night and day.**

**Counting autumn and winter’s passing years,**
**Spring and summer—**
**Four seasons of solitude.**

**Families great and small soon realize,**
**Then cease to boast of beauty or refine tastes.**
**The Qis of the Zhi Family**

**Frozen Clouds, Flourishing Vastness.**

**Emerging and vanishing, drifting boundless and far-reaching,**
**Expanding with ease—**
**Ascending to the lofty and mysterious,**
**Filling the heavens with dense, unyielding clouds,**
**Manifesting auspicious blessings.**

**The Six Flowers bloom in perfect harmony, fragrant and refined.**
**Lightly they drift, leisurely they sway, freely they rise and fall.**
**Swiftly they fade, layer by layer,**
**Each trace of their passage adorned in equal splendor.**
**No matter how high or low they roam,**
**How distant or near,**
**All merge indistinguishably.**

**Renewed in fresh purity and stillness,**
**Adorned with pristine hues and radiant brilliance,**
**Yet without bound—**
**It seems a celestial *qi* of fortune,**
**Drawing them to the central realm.**

**Their splendid purpose naturally overflows,**
**Years of abundance, seasons of ease.**
**Their verdant depths revealed,**
**Scattered dots of jade-green clouds return,**
**Fleeting fragments of sun radiance bloom.**
**They dissolve and gather at will,**
**Exactly like flowing butter—**
**Only the Daoist adept can truly savor them.**

**Though faint in scent, their essence lingers deep,**
**Holding still, their hidden fragrance profound.**
**A distinct charm fills the air,**
**Rising again in wondrous splendor,**
**Silently unveiling their true form.**
**Transformed into ice, a gem of flawless clarity,**
**Wind carves them delicate, their tones like chimes.**
**In quiet night, their chill becomes ever more intense,**
**Outshining stars and moon—**
**How ordinary could they be?**

**At their finest, they gleam with luminous clarity,**
**Reflecting light in mutual splendor.**
**Loftily they cast their radiance—**
**A joy to behold in this dusty mortal world,**
**To seek out hidden virtues.**

**Suddenly, the vast heavens exhale auspicious *qi*,**
**Waves of fortune surge and billow,**
**Temporarily unfolding everywhere.**
**Gathering thickly, they form a dense mist,**
**Gradually descending as patterned snowflakes.**
**Spread out in orderly ranks, frozen solid,**
**Their stern coldness a marvel to behold—**
**Like jade blossoms and pearl petals,**
**Crystalline flowers and moonlit fragments,**
**All known to be refined by the wind’s sharp blade.**
**Scattered and drifting, they dance lightly,**
**Shaping themselves like spread silk.**
**Perfectly uniform in hue,**
**No distinction between high and low, deep and shallow.**
**Their actions mirror the compassion of the sages,**
**Extending salvation, universal and boundless.**

**Yet the clear sky opens, the sun shines forth,**
**Dissolving their lingering remnants.**
**Once more, they return to their original state—**
**All things, pure and clear, are seen.**
**Fate is thin, burdens heavy—**
**My vision obscured, layer upon layer, now appears.**
**Urge yourself to act swiftly,**
**Abandon the past, embrace this path,**
**Turn back with earnest resolve,**
**To cultivate and refine with unwavering dedication.**
**Both practices completed, your sincerity far surpasses,**
**The Six Paths of time.**
**Then you shall return in splendor,**
**Selected among the Ten Pure Lands.**

**Stirring the Garden of Spring,**
**I ask myself from the start—**
**How did youth pass,**
**Each deed, each fleeting moment?**
**I sought only to refine, to ponder deeply,**
**Lest I defy heaven and earth,**
**Or offend the gods and spirits.**
**Now, as time wears on,**
**My face grows aged, my years now frail—**
**What medicine can mend my fate?**
**Do you not know?**
**Even the saints of the Three Teachings**
**Cannot follow where I tread.**
**In silence, I recognize this compassion.**
**Further, I name the *Yan* and sleep with *Ming*’s fragrance.**
**With purity and clarity,**
**Hidden brilliance revealed,**
**All refined at once—**
**Now, begin cultivation earnestly.**
**Seal the golden precepts with lips,**
**Transmit the jade essence with heart—**
**Past sins erased, sincerity not too late.**
**Search the past,**
**Find the Dao’s refuge,**
**Attain the Way without doubt.**

**Master Wang, named only for his virtue,**
**Self-called as one who knows the bright clarity,**
**Upright and unconstrained,**
**Further proclaiming his noble title—**
**The Recluse of Double-Ninth,**
**True purity, true companionship.**
**Each day, he sharpens the Daoist scriptures,**
**Burns incense with unwavering devotion,**
**Mastering the alchemy of water and fire.**
**Worthy to return as one,**
**In silence, his elegance refined—**
**Nothing lost, all gained.**
**Best suited to the *Kàn* and *Lí* phases.**
**Gathering treasures to forge the elixir,**
**Most wondrous of all.**
**Binding jade flowers and pearl buds,**
**Their light piercing the heavens,**
**Beyond the empty jade sky,**
**He presents the spirit mushroom.**

**Forming cloudly companions,**
**Becoming friends with misty hues,**
**Free and unbound in verse and song.**
**Where they gather,**
**The green crane and phoenix rise—**
**Paying homage to my teacher.**

**Capturing the red phoenix of the Jade Mountain,**
**Together they voyage in the divine boat,**
**Riding waves that surge and float.**
**Even the tortoise, opening its mouth,**
**Reveals wise counsel.**
**Drawing in the vast tides of the Northern Sea,**
**Spitting forth mighty waves to nourish the Western Lake—**
**Its own splendor unfurled.**
**Water ripples like flowered patterns,**
**All paved with golden brilliance.**
**Light pearls gleam,**
**Filling every corner,**
**Just like the bright moon,**
**Shimmering in its radiant quarters.**
**Universal splendor ascends,**
**All transformed into swirling hues—**
**Beholding the round pearls, deep and ever-revealing,**
**Forming the elixir, transcending the void.**
**Entering the jade path,**
**Ascending to Great Luo Heaven,**
**Forever awake and clear.**

---

**The Southern Vanguard**
**A fine paper crafted into a kite.**
**Seizing the wind’s favor, it finds its destiny.**
**Released into the sky, beyond the clouds’ reach—**
**Boundless.**
**Do not cling to stakes or strings that bind.**
**Upright, never let it stray.**
**Facing upward, all point to its virtue.**
**From this day, it soars in true freedom—**
**Like the flames that sever worldly ties.**

---

**Everlasting Happiness – Drawing the Contract**
**Laughing, Master Wang, once a child,**
**Bound his body in sacred vows.**
**Until now, at forty-eight,**
**Only now does he seek return.**
**Bearing all alone the labor’s weight,**
**For whose joy?**
**Determined to retrieve the sacred contract.**
**This debt unpaid—**
**Never taken, never struck before—**
**Swiftly he departs,**
**No one to hinder or restrain,**
**Rejoicing in roots that run deep.**
**Beside rivers, amid clouds,**
**Before winds, beneath moons—**
**He claims his true, auspicious fate.**
**Awake and clear,**
**Flawless and refreshing,**
**Once more he enters the silvered mist’s realm.**
**A radiant cluster,**
**Fiery and bright,**
**Within it, the finest mysteries.**
**Now is the time to turn back,**
**To begin earnestly,**
**To search for hidden wonders.**
**This perfect attainment—**
**Do not let it sink,**
**But make its meaning clear.**
**Avoid the fire pit,**
**Shun the mundane cage—**
**First leap free from both.**
**Awakened, he claims the Three Lights,**
**Wearing them always, their glow eternal.**
**A single spark of clarity,**
**Ever following the Five Colors,**
**Nine transformations—**
**The gate now open.**
**Piercing Kunlun’s heights,**
**Transmitting purity’s glow,**
**Listening as the Golden Rooster calls.**
**Moonlight shines, stars gather full—**
**Here, the jade blossoms’ fragrance curls.**

**Obtaining the Profound Profound,**
**The True Essence wrapped within—**
**This truth now fully revealed.**

**Water Dragon’s Song**
If the Daoist adept attains perfection,
**Eternal Authenticity** shall make him a **Superior Sage.**

**Bright and clear,**
**Awakened and unbound,**
**Seeking the subtle meaning.**

**Decisive return—**
**Not by choice, but dragged by mud and water.**
**Then, with resolute force,**
**Sever all dusty ties,**
**No obstruction remains—**
**Pure and untainted.**

**Gaining eternal life and keen vision,**
**Now, with radiant grace,**
**All functions harmonized.**
**Frequently entrusted,**
**A single luminous soul—**
**Golden light awakens early.**

**The Five Colors align thus,**
**Mutually aiding to ascend the **Cinnabar Sky**.**

**The Azure Boy comes to guide,**
**Approaching to welcome near,**
**Holding jade and pearl blossoms.**

**Pushing through the ferry’s pole,**
**The **Yin-Du Path**.**

**Fixed in place,**
**The **Lingchi Torture Ground**.**

**Then arranged—**
**Iron bed, boiling cauldron,**
**Mountains of knives, forests of swords.**
**Those who create evil have fate to witness.**
**Those who create evil have fate to witness.**
**Ghostly messengers record names in black ledgers.**
**No refusal—**
**Go with them.**

**Quickly cast off this mortal shell,**
**No reliance on wife, child, or daughter.**
**Endless suffering in the underworld.**
**Endless suffering in the underworld.**

**The **Penglai Path**.**
**Manifesting **Ease and Freedom**,**
**The realm of unbounded wandering.**
**Displaying eternal life’s splendor,**
**Jade blossoms, jade leaves,**
**Golden branches, treasure trees.**

**The virtuous may behold.**
**The virtuous may behold.**
**Youths in green robes keep the **Daoist Register**.**

**Functions perfected, ascending hence.**
**A single grain of **Golden Elixir** formed—**
**Thanks to the **Infant of the Cavern** and the **Maiden of the Peach**.**
**Never to endure the **Three Realms’** suffering.**
**Never to endure the **Three Realms’** suffering.**

**The **Tune of Mirth****
**Laughing, speaking of the profound mysteries.**

**The Infant of the Cavern and the Maiden of the Peach dance and leap.**
**The Azure Dragon and the White Tiger shake and call in mingled motion,**
**The Vermilion Phoenix and the Black Tortoise coil and weave around.**

**Suddenly the Cauldron of Mercury summons them—**
**Life and nature now clearly resolved.**
**Mountains steep, sunlight bright,**
**The boundless sky’s full moon shines resplendent.**
**All things in the forest ever encircle and enfold,**
**A single Dao/Way’s breeze wafts softly.**

**The Celestial Sovereign’s decree to the True Spirit beyond the void,**
**Dwelling in the Penglai Pass, guarding the sacred way.**

**The Tune of Nocturnal Revelry**
**Lock the door and fasten the key,**
**Within yet more wondrous stratagems.**
**Set the furnace, refine the golden essence,**
**Nurture the Original Spirit, perfect the elixir.**

**One grain formed, radiant and round—**
**Within the void, they come and go, circling.**
**All hues support it, yet no giving nor taking.**
**In the boundless dark, they vanish without recourse,**
**To measure fullness, to meet the sacred pact.**

**The Penglai Path ever seals their fate—**
**Fixed youth, immortal splendor, jade petals, and gem cups.**
**Equal to receiving the boundless Cool Light,**
**Emitting fragrant essence naturally.**

**Wrapped in the Teacher’s grace,**
**True joy and true delight manifest.**

**Again—**
**Master Zhong’s Mirror can reflect others but not itself.**
**A hundred-fold refined copper, round yet small,**
**Smoothly emits its luminous glow.**
**Before others, face-to-face,**
**Distinguishing features with clarity.**
**Good and ugly, old and young—**
**All earthly matters examined in one glance.**
**Mutual deception arises—**
**How then to perceive their true form?**

**There is another radiance, intimate and close,**
**The Heart-Mirror, master of profound mysteries.**
**It alone can gather past and present,**
**And discern the falsehoods of former times.**
**Vivid and dazzling, its light suits self-emulation—**
**Returning the Original Nature’s pearl to its source.**
**Wrapped in its grace, one attains full truth,**
**Ever bright, clearly resolved.**

**The Tune of the Jade Terrace’s Moon**
**Defying the Southern Peak’s final call—**
**With clouds unfurled, I wander the idle path,**
**Carried by eternal wind and moon.**
**Light returns and reflects,**
**Piercing the deep, the verdant blue.**
**Like the wrapped essence, gazing at distant hills,**
**Stillness gathers me back to tranquil seas.**

**The fate of past lives now meets this present one—**
**Encountering clarity, I face it clearly.**
**In love, the scene is radiant,**
**In gathering, the joy is serene.**
**This sacred mystery rivals all others—**
**Within and without, ever wear it as a crown.**
**Rising smoke curls in spirals,**
**All becomes a fragrant canopy.**
**Each time with companions of the Dao/Way,**
**Surely in the Hall of the Morning Clouds, I behold the sacred.**

**By the Three Illuminations,**
**Through the Three Meditations.**
**Discussing friendship, harmony knows no hindrance.**
**One luminous point—**
**Unbounded ease and freedom.**

**To cultivate is to seek swift paths—**
**The heart must ever be pure.**
**Searching the subtle truths,**
**Recognizing the Original Source’s gaze.**
**Within the Four Symbols,**
**Only clarity and freshness are used—**
**Deep and pure, the source’s flow is upright.**
**Exploring profound depths,**
**Observing distant heights.**
**Wearing the Three Illuminations,**
**Relying on the Three Saints.**
**Functions united,**
**Still, the full practice must be accomplished—**
**All through awakening and reflection.**

**Jade smooth, gold sharp, light resplendent—**
**Emitting hues, radiant and enduring.**
**The luminous nature now reveals its form,**
**A single cluster, red and bright.**
**Facing the void, the incense’s glow ascends,**
**Beyond things, it drifts and harmonizes.**
**From the start, the Original Nature—**
**From the start, the Original Life.**
**The path returns to clouds,**
**Emerging from the mountain’s peak.**
**Worthy of rejoicing at Penglai Isle,**
**I send the Pure and Verdant to invite.**

**The Full Court of Flowers**
**Master Liu inquires about nobility and humility—**
**This life’s wealth, this life’s poverty,**
**Calculated, all are past-life karmic ties.**
**Flourishing or withering, beauty or ugliness—**
**No faction, no bias.**
**Only in the luminous nature are seeds sown,**
**And by calling, good and evil are reaped.**
**Flowers bloom and fade—**
**Bloom as fields of blessing,**
**Fade as grounds of calamity.**
**The virtuous, like swift reflection,**
**Attain their destined fate,**
**Hiding their might, concealing their power.**

**If one can exhaust it all,**
**Then return as such.**
**Seize the root’s true essence,**
**Avoid entanglements—**
**Do not strive, nor fret.**
**Advancing the true mysteries,**
**Nobility and humility are not discussed—**
**This is the Great Luo Heaven.**

**Again—**
**Master Liu’s Request**
**Wisdom and virtue are all complete,**
**Stupidity and folly are all attained—**
**Two paths, distinct yet inherent.**
**One attains clear wisdom,**
**One is lost in nature’s wild embrace.**
**All are divisions of the luminous essence,**
**Each distinct—**
**This truth is manifest.**

**Do you know?**
**The upper person’s nine orifices,**
**The lower person’s marrow and vital core.**
**Wandering in thought,**
**Consider this matter—**
**In darkness, accumulating merit,**
**One becomes virtuous and wise.**

**Slightly foolish, yet still correcting—**
**The dull and the clever both guide.**
**I urge all to swiftly awaken and practice equality,**
**Eternal coolness and clarity.**
**True sincerity reveals itself—**
**Only inviting what was originally possessed,**
**Seizing the Daoist realms ahead.**

**Again—**
**Seeking Ink from Master Yi of Jingzhao Prefecture**
**The brush’s tip returns to me,**
**The Master of Calligraphy follows—**
**The three treasures of Tao Hong’s art are rare and splendid.**
**Chen Xuan’s mysteries are endless,**
**Yet still I have not found one to accompany me.**
**Day and night, I search for divine inspiration—**
**Where is it hidden?**
**Who can visit the lofty and refined?**
**Only Master Yi of Jingzhao.**

**Crude talent, like seeing wisdom—**
**Teach it to polish, vast as rolling clouds.**
**Inscribing sacred talismans and elixir seals,**
**Relieving suffering, dispelling calamities.**
**May all households embrace the Dao/Way,**
**And all awaken—**
**Free from the endless cycle of rebirth.**

**The practice succeeds, the path ahead is steady—**
**Together we go to feast at Penglai.**

**Again—**
**Not Yet Free from the Household**
**Not yet practicing, first attaining auspicious virtue—**
**In the home, performing blessings is fitting.**
**Morning and evening offerings,**
**Ever the scent of incense’s warmth.**
**Gradually, wealth diminishes, desires fade—**
**Observe the measure,**
**Nurturing parents and kin.**
**The ancient saying of taming the monkey and the horse—**
**Softness overcomes rigidity.**
**In all matters,**
**Prioritize others, then yourself—**
**Diligently recognize the shifts of fortune.**

**With the Six Relatives in harmony,**
**Friends gathered in perfect circles.**

**Ancestral Hall and Filial Piety**
Sacrifice at the sacred ancestral shrine—
Frequent acts of filial devotion,
Ordered by ancestral rites.

At festive seasons,
Joyful gatherings, toasting and song,
All singing *Manting Hua* in harmony.

**Desiring to Leave the Household**
If one seeks to practice,
Ultimate stillness must be attained—
Free from dust and worldly clamor.

Do not rely on external seats,
Morning and evening, stir the heart’s incense.
Must one diminish wife and abandon affairs,
Leave kin and homeland,
Only then does one return to the One.

When the people are at ease, the nation prospers,
Victory in war and strength in arms.
Enduringly, with ease,
Seek the profound mysteries,
Recognize the coolness of detachment.

Yet the Dao is boundless and formless—
Only in the radiant light of self-illumination
Does clarity arise for measurement.

On *Chongyang*’s day,
Golden chrysanthemums greet the frost,
Alone, one drinks to *Manting Hua*’s fullness.

**On Practice**
When yin is exhausted and yang is pure,
Life halts, nature abides—
First, recognize cinnabar’s wisdom, lead’s knowledge.

White firm, black steadfast,
Earth-Horse follows Wood-Ox.
From *Mao* and *You*, follow *Zi* and *Wu*,
*Jia* and *Geng* converge—
Use *Kan* to welcome *Li*.

When the *Daoqi* arrives,
Shock-Dragon and *Dui*-Tiger,
Crimson Phoenix battles the Tortoise.

Fitting—true water and fire,
*Gui*-Ding’s furnace and kiln,
When the elixir forms, no doubt remains.

Sipping nectar and jade dew,
Divine waters in the flowered pool.
Nourishing the sacred sprout with blessed snow,
The rooster crows at dawn,
The rabbit shifts with the moon.

The Golden Elder rejoices,
The Yellow Nurse stands ready,
Nurturing the fair maiden and the infant.

**The Jade Flower Society of Wen Deng’s Zhang and Shao**
Master Wang’s legacy remains,
The Jade Flower Society convened—
This was for Zhang the Lord.

Then came the Shao clan,
Their halls unbuilt, neglected.
All now regret, awakening fiercely—
The hare rises, casting aside the clay ball.
Do they not know?
A broken string cannot be mended,
Spilled water cannot be retrieved.

Cease, cease—
Each to their own path,
Though I linger with affection,
I shall not turn back.

May all noble hearts remember,
In shared currents of the Dao.
Parting thoughts already stir—
Golden lotus seeds,
Their light fills the Western State.

I must return to Wen Deng’s triumphant scene,
No longer to revisit.

**West River Moon**
Nurturing the *Jia* cannot compare to cultivating nature,
Refining the body cannot match refining the heart.
From beginning to now, all this striving—
Each day’s labor, what does it truly gain?

Seek the subtle mysteries,
Then ponder the profound principles.
A friend who glimpses gold in water
Would not wander in barren fields in vain.

**Recalling the Wandering Prince**
They say the mouth is the gate of calamity,
I say the tongue is its root.
Silence is better than idle speech.
Measure dawn and dusk—
Then one preserves life in tranquil ease.

**Su Mu Zha**
Few bother me, seldom do they gather.
I have no favors to bestow—
Do not blame others for their indifference.
With virtue and frugality, my heart is at ease.

□[Do not] seek their company,
For rabbits often linger in debt’s embrace.
When wealth is plentiful,
All flock to show their affection.
But when money is gone,
Even kin grow cold and distant.
See how the world’s emotions shift so swiftly—
I have fathomed human hearts,
Yet find no remedy beyond this.

**Golden Rooster’s Call**
A warning to Master Liu:
I seize the empty void—
Graceful and refined, peerless in elegance.
Profound within profound,
Wondrous beyond all wondrous.
Naturally, five hues radiate with spirit’s glow.
A single luminous pearl,
Envelops in a thousand threads of dawn’s blush.
Pure and clear, cool and bright,
Dim and silent, shadowy and elusive.
All things in the cosmos gleam with splendor.
Moon wraps the hare’s cry,
Sun wraps the golden rooster’s call.

**Recalling Old Friends in Peach Springs**
On the tortoiseshell branch, jade blossoms gleam,
And coral buds form in secret.
The dark jade leaves are my delight—
Which of the four can truly compare?
In stillness, I recognize the true treasure,
Its brilliance no mere trifle.
Only one knows it for what it is,
Together we return to the **Penglai Isle**.*[^1]

---
*[^1]: **Penglai Isle** (蓬莱岛) – One of the Three Isles of Immortality in Daoist mythology.

**Song: *Nanxiangzi***

**On the Nature of All Things**
All things must cease, cease.
Shatter every form—pierce through to the end.
Recognize the original true face—
Cultivate, cultivate,
A single luminous sprout, steady and sought.

Fire wraps the swift boat.
Flame wraps the pale lotus’ hidden face.
Fragrant and dense before the wind, stretching far—
Drifting, drifting,
Piercing through the azure void to true freedom.

**Admonishing Those Who Pay Homage**
How pitiful these stubborn men!
Wasting strength in crude, futile toil.
Five limbs prostrate to the earth—
Foolishly, still laboring over this borrowed flesh.
The Dao is fundamentally empty and boundless.
Mysterious within, concealing mysteries beyond measure.
Within lies the primal light—yet none perceive it.
Only I, day by day, observe and breathe it in.

No longer chasing after all things.
Waving away, I walk—all matters cease.
Turning back to behold my true form,
Carefree, unbound—where is there sorrow?
Boarding this great divine vessel,
Jade oars and pearl buckets crossing the current.
Surging past the raging waves, all obstacles vanish—
Strategy now—soaring above the Ten Isles and Three Isles.

**To Master Yu on Illusory Transformation**
Illusory forms swirl about.
Lightning’s afterglow ripples on the water’s surface.
Sudden presence, sudden absence—swift as the wind,
Like a storm—
A white steed fleeting past the blink of an eye.

Why not awaken from this empty delusion?
Turn early to nurture the jade sprout.
On it, the golden elixir shines radiant—
Manifest, piercing through the cloudy paths into the emerald sky.

**To Master Shao on Beginning Practice**
My fate is not dictated by Heaven;
Plow the Three Fields with skill, guarding the wondrous mystery.
Sweet rain deepens first—planting the seeds,
Gold coins scattered—
Everywhere, the yellow sprouts bloom most vividly.
Cultivate the jade lotus—
Each leaf distinct, forever firm.
Pearl medicine stirred by the wind,
Fragrance spreading—a single luminous thread, natural and free.

**On the Wind Chime**
The master’s hand delights in new creation.

**The Sixteen-String Zither**

Sixteen strings—each with its own name,
Hanging in the Palace of the Clouds beyond mortal paths,
The wind greets them—
Then they willingly summon their own resonance.
Not bound by the common, but heard in the profound.
Seizing the celestial melody to expound the **Dao** scriptures,
Only beside me do all listen with perfect clarity—
Chiding, I lead you to **Penglai** within the Jade Court.

*Master Xiao* laments the calf that fails to call its mother.
Its nature is like rushing waters—
Swift, the emerald waves flow.
It knows only sweet milk to make balm and oil,
Ever following its mother, wagging its tail, shaking its head.
Into the stream it plunges, then the ravine—
Gradually, it runs wild with no restraint.
Galloping through valleys, untamed by bridle, it follows its own will.
Chasing fragrant grasses, how could it know the woes of tigers and wolves?
Worthy of lament—this calf of the world!

The **Dragon Gate** ox stands firm,
Galloping with the wind’s flow.
Its body smooth as ink, supple as oil,
Charging boldly—dragged back, it turns no head.
When will this suffering cease?
Its sinews strained to exhaustion, it lies in the ditch.
Without cause, it is reviled by men.
Like idle water grass, it cannot escape a single blade’s woe.

**The Wind Chime (Sguazo Society)**
The Sguazo Society’s wind chime—
This wind chime is the music of the **Dao** Immortals.
Seeing a spirit child, within it so bright and graceful,
Naturally it can play in harmony.
Long strings gleam with jade pendants,
A golden flower blooms upon its head, radiant—
Then it sets the Five Directions leaping in rhythm.
At dawn, it lifts its cloud-treading feet,
At dawn, it lifts its cloud-treading feet.
In its ecstatic dance, the true joy is perfect.
Revealing its delicate intricacies—
Clear, resonant, adorned with tinkling ornaments—
It draws down the **Luan** cranes and **He** herons,
Welcoming and sending them in endless flight, together they swirl,
And together they dance, radiating the Nine **Danyao** lights.
On the **Penglai** path, there are vows to be kept,
On the **Penglai** path, there are vows to be kept.

「Lament for Delays in Joy#1
**Zhiqing** (喆) **Sai** (排三), surnamed **Wang** (王),
Courtesy name **Zhīmíng** (知明), posthumous title **Chóngyáng** (重阳).
Like the chrysanthemum, as if to exhale its fragrance slowly,
Waiting for the frost to deepen.

In years of studying the *Yì* (易, *I Ching*), he grew old,
His **Dao** attire (道装) met—
Encountering **Yuánmíng** (渊明, *Mister of the Abyss*), speaking of me in **Jiāxiáng** (嘉祥, *Auspicious Luck*).
Pointing to **Penglai** (蓬莱),
Measuring the **Mǎilù** (买路, *Path of Purchase*) as if returning home slowly,
The land need not hurry.

**Mountain Pavilion Willow** (山亭柳)
Swiftly turns its head—
Clear reasons, clear causes.
Seeking no more in things and matters.
Seeing clearly, each grasp distinct—
All things shattered, free in leisure.

Pure naturally, luminous and transparent,
Clear, reaching the true **xiū** (修, *cultivation*).
Wondrously, within it flows passage and return,
Mysteriously, its surface is searched with fine care.

Brightly, it penetrates the **míngyōu** (冥幽, *darkest obscurity*).
Steadily, it holds the **yínzhào** (银棹, *silver oar*),
Awake, it steers the **Dàfǎ shénzhōu** (大法神舟, *Divine Vessel of the Great Law*).

Swiftly, it departs to cross the **bì'àn** (彼岸, *Further Shore*),
Soulfully, it manifests in **Yíngzhōu** (瀛洲, *Isle of the Sea*).

**Spring in Wǔlíng** (武陵春)
Heaven and Earth honor only the **Zhēnrén** (尊人, *Venerable One*), and he is noble,
The sun, moon, and stars attend him.

The **Dao** (道), **Shì** (释, *Buddha*), and **Rú** (儒, *Confucianism*) teachings are most profound,
**Jīngqì** (精气, *Essential Qi*) aids the spirit in tranquility.

The four **sānbān** (三般, *Three Categories*—*Dao*, *Buddha*, *Confucianism*) are all understood,
**Dānjié** (丹结, *Cinnabar Essence*) transforms into gold.

On the **gǔnshàng** (衮上, *Imperial Robes*), the **Míngtáng** (明堂, *Hall of Light*) reveals its jade peaks,
Beyond the void, it finds its resonant companion.

**Sweetgrass Son** (甘草子)
Dust-bound, unwilling to cultivate,
Each clings to fleeting joy.
Turning again, enamored with glory and splendor,
How could they ever awaken to enlightenment?

Waiting only for **Yīngōng** (阴公, *The Lord of Darkness*) to guide them,
Then they hurry to follow.
Already sent back to earth by their children and grandchildren,
Who now will be their master?
**Welcoming the Dao Guest** (迎仙客)

The Master said:

*"Why, if one practices the Way, do teeth fall out and hair turn white?"*
I reply: *"At fifty-five, I still toil to gather the harvest.
Fifty-five—past half a century—all you noble ones search for me relentlessly.
Eyes dim as if veiled, ears still hear, yet teeth crumble in my mouth,
My beard and mustache now white as frost.
Externally, my form is withered and gray,
Internally, my essence remains black as ink.
Golden flowers bloom upon the earth—true millet and wheat.
Stalks are painted, ears are arched,
Three carts carry them away—then comes the **Welcoming of the Dao Guest**."*

**Lamenting the Fleeting Bloom**
All you noble ones study—do not stray from the path.
Do not let your hearts wander like wild monkeys or inferior steeds.
In stillness, recognize the profound mechanisms at work.
Silent, yet naturally joyous—
Pure and clear, you pull the void itself taut.
When asked, *"Do you not arise nor perish?"*
I answer: *"Merit and practice must be fully realized.
With a true teacher, the path becomes clear, and they come to guide you.
The Tortoise of the First Heaven enters fire—seen with certainty.
The Tiger of the Sixth Heaven plays in water.
Going and returning, they escort you as companions.
Naturally, they are the two households that bind you."*

「Well able to nurture and refine into fragments,
Wrapping the outer and transforming it into exchange.
In the void, a youth of **Dao** is summoned—
At that moment, a single surge pierces the celestial realms.

**Pointing the Vermilion Lip**
The Master first locks the door for a decade,
Then opens it again—
With a single pearl, he cuts it into ten,
And shares it with the **Ma** and **Yue** couple.

Once the door is opened,
Only **Yue**’s household lineage becomes his disciple.
At this point, he bestows upon them a verse.

*"Tenfold Pearls from the Pear"*—
In the year before, I birthed a **sangha** institution.
The two elders and their mother—
Await my teaching to become **cloud-hand** adepts.

I shattered their hearts with my own,
And laughed their doubts away.
From this day onward,
Let them return to their original ways,
And follow the **Kingly Dao** as companions.

**The Graceful Moth**
Admonishing the **Dao** officials:
Seeing one another’s **true nature** (*xīngxīng*)—
A genuine, unrestrained encounter,
Worthy of comparison to the **Great Sage** (*dàzhàng’r*).

Do not begrudge the **graceful moth** beneath the lamp,
For it ruins one’s **fate** (*mìng’r*).
Turn back early and seek the **hidden marvels** (*mìmiào*),
Nourishing the **Dao**’s blossoming youth (*zhīnǚ yīng’r*).

The **Dao robe** exchanged for a **plain hemp garment** (*zàoshān’r*),
Now serving the **Highest Sovereign** (*Tàishàng*) as a son.

**The Southern Branch**
A white egret stands in the **heart of the Jiang**,
A tortoise dives beneath the water’s depths.

---

**The Vermilion Chicken**

A crimson rooster gathers among jade-green bamboo,
Four phases refined in the pot to elixir’s gold.
The five flavors blend in harmony’s feast,
The *Chónglóu* plant trusted as sustenance.

Filling the six *fǔ* organs brings peace and health,
Nurturing the *Zhēnshén*—vital essence leaps into the *xiān tán*’s hall.

They sigh at the wind’s flickering candle,
They lament the water’s drowned corpse.
Birth and death in endless cycle—when will it cease?
Like the wheel’s turning, boundless in *liú*’s endless flow.

Know the donkey and the horse,
Yet not ignore the mule and the ox.
How does one escape this fate?
Fortunate in human form, now hasten to perfect *Zhēnxiū*.

**Night Palace Tour**

My body rests in deep mountains, drifting with ease,
Ascending green peaks, free as I please.
Cold, I wear coarse grass robes; weary, I sleep.
Feasting on pine, when thirst comes, I drink clear streams.

Nurturing *shén* and *qì* in balance, I know no want—
No chill, no hunger, no restlessness.
I’ve claimed the land of *xiāoyáo*, pure and free.

In joyful ease, I enter crimson clouds,
Enveloped in emerald mist.
I revel in the *Jiāngshén*’s grace.

**Empty Within, Void Without**

I see the fullness in the hollow, boundless *yíngyíng*.
Delight in the path ahead, clear as day.
I’ve found the *Zhēnshén*—firm and true,
With *huì*’s light guiding my newfound way.

Five gates open, passage free and wide,
Come and go as I will, roaming at my leisure.
On towering peaks, I move with ease,
Weaving cloud canopies, my might is fierce.

One form shines with *língguāng*—mystic radiance,
A single point like crimson cherry’s essence.
Colors swathe me in endless, tranquil embrace,
In cool serenity, my life eternal.

**Praise for the Sacred Reign**

To cultivate the *Dao*, one must wear simple cloth,
And take the meal of *jìngliáo*—silent, pure.
The *Dao* heart differs from the common mind,
Severing cares, free from all thought’s bind.

Within, I recognize the *Jīnwū*’s gathering gold,
And the *Yùtù*’s moonlit, luminous fold.
The *Chìluán* clutches the *Hēiguī*’s essence bright—
Who among you grasps this truth’s pure light?

**Longing for the Dao**

Zhōugōng’s question: *"How to know the heart, to see the nature?"*
Do not recite, do not chase—
This *Xuánjī* is deepest, most profound.
How can one discern the *Běnxīn*’s ground?

Seize it with skill, or scale its heights.
A lone moon wheel gleams on jade peaks,
Only then does one know—water enfolds gold.

**The Curtain Rises**

Téngqí releases the tortoise—
This *shén guī*, deep thanks I owe.
Your *Dù* vast, your grace profound,
In endless *míngmíng*—radiant, boundless glow.

Like *Máo Bǎo*’s return to shore,
You honor me with your praise.
I bow in jest, with *Jīnlian*’s grace,
And *yì*’s humble embrace.

A thousand years of *xiálíng*—longevity’s span,
Now my life’s joy grows ever grand.
My spirit brightens, clear and strong,
In one breath, I lift you to the clouds’ throng.

**#2**
*Again, the monk of Qin渡 Funeral Grounds seeks instruction*
Look well upon the scriptures, know how to offer repentance.
With gold-faced rouge, dip again and again—
The swirling hue grows deep, never fading thin.
Its color wraps the Perfect Truth,
And Perfect Truth becomes clear and luminous.

Hold the lead pen, brandish the mercury tool—
Carve through darkness, through the murky night,
To reveal the dazzling silver clouds.
Ten thousand rays of radiance converge in one point.

*Prajñāpāramitā*’s waves—
Gained and gained, yet never more or less.
Do not cling to the body,
Nor sit in vain meditation.
Agitate the marrow, shake the sinews,
Suckle thick, viscous saliva—
External practices bring no resonance.
You weary your spirit, waste your efforts in vain.

Act as you will, like one asleep.
Just pierce the heart’s single thread—
The reflected light reveals itself:
Five-colored radiance enfolds the luminous pearls,
The Five-Peak Mountains, their threefold brilliance.
All Eight Consciousnesses illuminated,
The Four Symbols’ spirit light encircling.
The *Arhats* turn to see the *Bodhisattvas*—
The fruit of Buddhahood is complete,
Here, no words can answer.

Attain the *Void* (*śūnyatā*)—then you are free.
Pure and serene, all supported,
Clear and bright, their harmony complete.
Do not divide the spirit pearls by rank—
Their hues transmit their splendor.
The Golden Pagoda manifests anew.

---

*Again, to Brother Tán and Brother Táng*
Teach all people:
Do not toil ceaselessly.
Search for hidden mysteries,
Cultivate *merit* and *wisdom* (*huì*).
Light the lamp to scrutinize the nature.

Carefully nurture your form—
Eat and drink to secure your fate.
Bow to the wind as uncle,
Two by two.
Nephew, do not cling—
I press you with urgent words.
Follow the new precepts, clear and refined,
*Tánglín*’s truth, *Dàdá*’s essence.

---

*Again, to the Apothecary Master Zhào of Jīngzhào*
Master Zhào, invited to feast,
Eats water-rice.
Pearl by pearl, grain by grain—
*Lingzhi* mushrooms, their roots entwined.
Consumed, they birth the luminous garden.
Open the *Lotus Sutra*’s radiant blossoms,
No longer bound to mortal flesh.

Merge the Three Lights,
Divide the Four Symbols.
Strengthen your spirit—
The child of the treasure cauldron thrives.
Five-colored radiance fills one foundation,
This is the fullness of a lifetime’s wish.

---

*Again, exhorting the people of Líqúan*
People of Líqúan, all do good.
Time flees swift—like water, like an arrow.
Do not boast of empty honors.
Your mortal forms are fleeting,
Like silkworms knowing their fate.
Each is bound and tangled,
Praising their cocoons.
Wrapped in true essence,
They wait for the pot’s searing.
This is King Sān’s expedient means—
Before belief, no harm in windy faces.

---

Break apart the finest dust,
Leap forth from the Three Peaks’ gate.
Moon rises in the east,
Sun sets in the *yǒu* direction.

Shining stars, three in step,
Their radiant light follows.
Pass the *qi* pure,
Move the spirit refined.
When the two meridians harmonize,
True practice and true power are achieved.

Piercing the clear sky’s brilliance,
Only then does *wuwei* reveal itself—
At last, the path to *wú lòu* is seen.

---

**Again, presenting to the Duke of Jingzhao, Wang Xiaoliu**

This virtuous man,
Skilled in martial arts and agility.
When asked of my practice,
He speaks of extraordinary intent.
Yet how can he escape
The burden of time and family affairs?
And there’s another matter—
Wives and children are hard to abandon.

I advise Master Ming:
Do not seek *chūlí*—
Burn incense daily,
Cherish the Three Lights’ nobility.
With a mind full of expedient means,
Year by year, step by step,
You’ll reach the clouds and mists wrapped in radiance.

---

**Again, exhorting those in cultivation**

Do not practice *gōng*,
Cease not sitting in meditation.
If you wish to cultivate,
First tame the heart-monkey.
Draw in the black *qi*—
Break through to *wú lòu*.
Slowly ascend and nurture,
Preserve your spirit-essence.

The dark maiden plays,
The infant sleeps.
Lifted to the Central Field,
Passing through the Bright Hall.
A single white *lotus* folded,
Carried into the void,
Pearls released, one by one.

The tears flow thick and the saliva pools—
Consumed, they drain the vital essence.
The dregs of the Five Grains linger, hard to transmute.
Just fodder for the hungry ghost—
What need for idle vexation?

He who knows cultivation understands inversion.
Another taste exists—
Naturally divine.
The Spirit-Waters and Flower-Pools align with the True Dao,
Irrigating the Elixir Field,
Soon returning to Penglai Isle.

---

**To the Cart-Driver**
Wood has no sentiment, yet it acts.
Skilled hands shape its form—
A hollow shell.
The black ox strains, the yellow ox pulls taut,
Drawn into the red dust—
How can it escape the wheel of rebirth?
Busy in stillness, active in leisure—
How to attain true ease, unbounded joy?
Only when the white ox leaps,
A single lotus blooms,
A myriad rays of radiance flare.

---

**Exhorting the World**
The human body—like dew on grass—
Morning light dries it back to dust.
A hundred years’ span is fleeting.
Yet cling to the dusty world,
Willingly enduring hardship’s sting.
Hear me, all who listen:
Break free from the mundane cage,
Seek the path of eternal life.
Turn back soon, yet still you linger—
On the Seven Treasures Peak,
Become a companion of the clouds and mists.

To Penglai Isle #3—
The hermitage burned, yet fruit remains.
Two disciples from Ninghai return to rebuild.
Master Zhongyang—
Nothing is pursued.
Clouds and waters drift in carefree play—
The thatched hut burned, yet all is at rest.
Another fine return awaits.
Preserve the foundation—
Future generations will restore it.
Even as a refined Daoist precept,
How can one emulate my elegance?
I have already gone to Yingzhou.

---

**Seeking Money at the Liquor Spring**
The Liquor Spring is fine,
Yet it favors the poor child.
To shatter the empty illusions of desire,
I seize the foolish monkey’s hand.
No sons, no daughters—
On both sides of the street,
I beg for small coins.
Together, let us buy golden barley-rice,
Feeding the iron ox three times daily.
Tending the aged infant.
The True Dao can unite *kàn* and *lí*—
Recognize where the Five Phases do not reach—
Before parents gave you birth.
This truth is not hard to know.
Reflect swiftly—
Begin cultivation now.
Above, the Three Lights shine eternally,
Within, the Two *Qi* must not be divided.
Pluck the Jade Spirit-Mushroom.
The cultivator must seek the path ahead.
Dark and obscure, stripping away self,
Dull and silent, severing human ties.
In the True embrace lies purity.
Only then does one awaken—
Leisurely, reaching clarity within emptiness.
All things shattered, clear as day.
Cultivation’s work—
Carefully laid out.
Externally, the Four Limbs’ comforts,
Internally, the Five Viscera’s inversion—
This is True Wholeness.
Firmly guard the foundation,
Nurture the shell with diligence.
The Two *Qi* harmonize, opening innate nature,
The Three Fields are moved, aiding spirit and essence.
Only this summons the Immortal.
The True Great Medicine—
Its brilliance is evident.
The Two *Qi* enfold the Threefold Refined,
Double-sealed, locking the Ninefold Mysteries.
Who understands this need not be taught.
Ancient hymns of the Immortals—
Two lines hold the deepest study.

「To cross the river, ordinary bones indeed need a raft,
Yet sages reach the shore without need of a boat.
Ascending beyond the harm of the *prevalent winds*,
Where monkeys and horses dwell—
Life and *Dao* naturally known.

A single grain of *Dao-qi* opens the Four *Xiàng* (phenomena),
Two methods of *sword-fist* slay the Three *Shī* (corpse-spirits).
Divine water irrigates the *Huá Chí* (flowering pool).
Observe well—
This is the *Kàn* (water) and *Lí* (fire) hexagrams.

Earth-horses drive back the Golden Tiger,
Iron oxen plow forth the Jade Dragon.
Only then does one meet a True Teacher.

True *forging* and *cultivation*—
Driving away illusions, dispelling confusion.
Crushing the moonlit path to reveal the straight way,
Splitting the wind-scape to enter the *Mystic Gate*.
Only then does the *Dao* family’s honor shine.

No grasp needed—
A single point reveals *Kūnlún* (the sacred peak).
Returning to dwell in the void, transcending *造化* (*Zào Huà*, the Creative Transformation),
Obtaining return beyond the world, surpassing *乾坤* (*Qián Kūn*, Heaven and Earth).
If one fails to grasp this, it will perish.

*Zhòng Yáng* (Master of the Double Yang) drank water and gained the True cause—
Washing away dusty toil, clarifying purity to its utmost,
Irrigating the root, extending the *jiǎ yá* (first sprouts of life).
Here, *qi* and spirit are nourished.

Serene and tranquil, sweet dew tastes the True.
Drip by drip, it opens the Three Teachings’ principles,
Stream by stream, it transmits the Four Seasons’ spring.
Flowing in pure renewal.

If one can act—
Then one knows this *yuán yuán* (primordial origin).
Why does one grasp the Three-in-One Law?
All because of insight into the Five Thousand Words.
Raising the True root’s source.

With firm steps,
Leaping into the *water-crystal basin*.
Summoning forth that which all fail to recognize,
Yet today still stir themselves to seek.
Ascending beyond the harm of the *prevalent winds*,
With reverent return—
Only then does one know *Xī Yí* (the Hidden and Obscure).

*Forging* and *cultivation* must extinguish all emotions,
*Cultivation* must strictly oppose worldly forms.
Piercing through this is the True return.
The *Moon Rabbit’s Jade* moves—
Recognize the *Golden Phoenix*’s flight.

East and West exchange positions, penetrating earth’s marrow,
Above and below harmonize, merging with Heaven’s mechanism.
Only then does one attain the subtle wonders.

The cultivator—
Discusses the Four *Shì* (affairs) in inverted order.
Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind must be transformed and let go,
Colors, sounds, scents, and tastes—how can they endure?
Only then does the True cause reveal itself.

All attainments—
Obscure and silent, with dimness and confusion.
Wisdom’s nature returns to the path of clarity,
True spirit enters and exits the Mystic Gate.
Beyond the void, the Nine Radiant Lights are complete.

The True Great *Dao*—
Its nourishment and taste cannot be exhausted.»

The moon’s light shimmers bright within its glow,
The clear wind whistles soft with *mòmò* grace.
From here, the *zhī* sprouts are revealed—
No narrow or broad, nor distant or near.
Round and whole, effortless and free,
One attains the boundless, drifting with ease.
Only then does clarity fully shine.

The oriole’s song—
At the time of its call, it circles the red.
The trees must answer as master.
With *yīngyīng* voices, bright and clear,
It plays with the sun’s tongue and feathered scales.
Hidden within the lush crimson woods,
Its speech shifts endlessly in myriad forms.

Joy in fresh lead, fresh mercury aligned,
Calling back to the ancestral root.
Awakening the drowsy, suddenly knowing
The original source—natural rule and measure.
Fixed are the divisions—*jiǎyǐ gēngxīn*,
The Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams’ gates.
Drive the Four Symbols, push through the Seven Returns,
Use the thousand days to forge *wénwǔ*—
This *jīndān*—
In two years’ time, gradually made visible.

An infant straddles the tiger,
A fair maiden rides the dragon,
White clouds summon emerald mist.
Each wields—
Steel blades, wisdom-swords,
Clashing edges, hidden mechanisms—
No fear between the two.

The tortoise and crimson phoenix
Come to submit and surrender,
Warfare ceases, arms laid down—
The spirit-child constructs harmony.
From this point onward,
Searching slowly for treasures complete,
To see is to know their count.

Ten thousand pearls—
Spouting divine light, inverted and encompassing.
A silver mist unfurls,
Piercing the clear sky,
Dazzling the bright expanse,
Opening the jade path.
Within, alone stands
The True Marvel, the True Mystery—
Star-crowned, moon-cloaked in solemn array,
Lifting its twin eyes to gaze again and again.

Gazing clearly, pure and bright,
Deep and limpid—
The *hài* wind finds its match.

**Observing the Floating World—**
To be human is noble.
Abandon glory and wealth,
Preserve *qi* and spirit whole.

「Nurture the *dāntián*, abandon all taste.
Then bring forth—
The hare makes no concealment.
Self-aware, self-restraining,
Cultivate the means to eternal life.
Self-vowed, self-vowed—
Today, I speak in detail.

Open the boundaries to awaken wisdom,
Subdue wine, lust, wealth, and *qi* in equal measure.
Rooted and preserved,
The belt is eternally steadfast.
How to achieve the union of Tiger and Dragon,
How to command the *zāyīng* to sleep in harmony.
Cast aside all dusty labors,
Merge the Two Paths, return to the original kind.

Contemplate the *Xuán-xuán*,
Seek the *mì-mì*.
Self-moving, self-moving—
Realize nature without command.
Self-alert, self-alert—
First seize the black tempest.

Let the inverted encompass only what can be sung,
Both pulses flowing back and forth bring auspiciousness.
Distinguish the clear and the still—
The tortoise now takes warning,
Opening its gaze to radiant brilliance.

Frolic in waves, revel in tides,
Behold the radiant scene atop *Hèxī* Mountain.
The waves settle, the billows still—
Self-dwelling, self-dwelling,
Retreat to the *Kǎn* door of the *Lí* palace.
Self-enlightened, self-enlightened,
Build the lead chamber within the mercury.

Often glance, often regard each other,
The upward and downward surges harmonize—
Their paths known.
Gradually entering,
The path of clouds and mists.
The crimson phoenix flies, its feathers vibrant,
Drinking deep from the *Wū* River, beholding the Water Palace.

With the spirit as master and ancestor,
Only the *dāo* and *guī* can soothe *Cháng’ān*.
Then shall you teach—
The child to accompany noon.
Self-seated, self-seated,
True fire seen upon the wood.
Self-joyous, self-joyous—
No calamity from before.
The eastern rain is settled, trustworthy and sincere,
Moistening leaves, nourishing branches into blossoms.
Clustered, clustered—
Jade pearls.
Emerald mist ascends, locking all beneath,
White dew congeals, bearing the void above.
Exchange structures, sleep together in ease,
Only then does life know no binding.

Not by Heaven, but by Self.
Self-reclining, self-reclining,
Rest in the Western Quarter.
Self-assisting, self-assisting,
Gather true fire upon the Spirit Platform.
The *Gēng-Xīn* lessons resonate in harmony,
All things plucked—all shattered.
Originally revealed—
This one alone.
Leaping beyond, neither small nor great,
Striking after—neither rigid nor weak.
Resounding like this sound—
Echoing through the *Míngtáng*, clear and resonant.
Encountering the *línglóng*,
Together in celebration.
Self-knowing, self-knowing—
Only this is clear.
From this, henceforth—
Obtaining One, no longer Four.
Within the void, scatter golden threads,
Ten thousand rays of *xiá* light permeate the embrace.
Restore the Original,
Behold the Beginning.
To refine the true and authentic essence,
No need for Wood, Metal, Fire, or Water.
Build the foundation of good cause from the heart,
The inch-square realm—cool, without joy or sorrow.
Attest to eternal life,
And prolonged vision.

*Chóngyáng* Child,
The *hài* wind’s master.
*Wáng Zhé* by name,
*Zhīmíng* as character.
Speaking of cultivation’s intent—no deceit,
Within the *Zhuómù* words, true principles unfold.
To all gentlemen,
Take heed and commit.

To grasp the true principle,
Silently ponder, subtly reflect—
Rely on cause and effect.

Now, joy and delight arise,
Devotion to the Mysterious Dao,
And the gate is sealed.

Incandescent and lucid—truly worthy,
With natural incense and fire;
In stillness, profound tranquility—
Distinctly, one sees:
The Master comes to behold me.

Exquisite wine and delicacies,
Trustingly consumed at will—
Feasts are best of all.

Sated with virtue and power,
Only singing and dancing in revelry,
[□] rejoicing in Dao’s discourse.

Frequently plucking the *língzhī* spirit-plant,
Summoning its fragrant essence.

Clouds and mists envelop the world,
Cranes and mandarin ducks lead the way—
Yet I depart for the *Pénglái* Isles.

*Moon-in-the-Heaven*:
A self-composed ode.
I ask you, Wang San,
What is your *yīnyuán* cause and fate?
The *hài* wind’s harm—
Where does it dwell in your heart?

Alone, with a serene smile,
For life and death, death and life—
Most clearly discerned.

Turn to awaken your true nature,
No longer envious of
Mortal praise and the Five *Dà* Robes.

The realm of pure coolness,
Flesh and fur are of no use—
Why recall silk and cotton?

When the body fully manifests,
This robe of green and white,
All of coarse hemp.

A *húlú* gourd stores medicine,
And in my armpit, the *jīngwén* sutras—
Saving humanity from suffering.

A bamboo staff to lean upon,
Attending to the *zìzài* boundless,
The *xiāoyáo* free and easy *zhōnglǚ* bell.

The Dao’s path homeward,
With mist and cloud as companions.

*Obstacles of the Spring Wind*—
Suddenly encountering *Ruǎn Láng* Lord,
Without warning, my eyes redden.

My vision obscured by misty veils,
How can I see the precious pupils?

The wondrous medicine,
Now cultivated and revered—
The skilled physician’s virtue shines.

A single stroke of the golden comb,
And the thread of fate is severed—
The Three *Guāng* [Sun, Moon, and Stars] are inherently pure.

---

*Ode to the Paper Robe*—
A gift to *Cài Lún* for aiding in its creation,
Revealing the paper robe on my person.

Fresh and spotless—rare in the world,
Shielding against dust and toil.

Jade-like sheen,
Luminous as jade—
The cold wind’s force grows faint.

The chill’s might retreats,
Unveiling the Dao’s essence—
White clouds drift freely.

---

*Spring’s Joyful Migration*—
A gift to a Daoist friend.

You seek the good—
This Great Dao is wordless,
How then does one return?

Abandon the superficial,
Search for the Mysterious Dao,
Casually wrapped in cultivation’s art.

Seize the original true nature,
Grasp the root’s expedient means—
Its primordial face,
How does it appear?
Must it be revealed.

Behold it directly,
Worthy of deep affection—
Please come to the *Gōngjiāo* [Palace of the Red Bird],
Where a jade feast awaits.

In the gathering’s radiance,
A thousand rays of cloud-light,
Piercing the pearly *yáo* snowflakes.

A single gem of precious clarity,
Bursting forth like lightning’s brilliance.

Ascending to the *Zhōngyāng* Central,
Returning to the *Dàluó* Great Netherworld—
Forever free from transmigration.

---

*Joy of the Return to Court*—
Where did I dwell when *Heaven* and *Earth* first divided?
What name did my parents bestow when unborn?
Must this be made clear,
And the principle explored—
No need to debate its truth.

Refining the *bù'èr* non-dual,
One essence remains, tracing back to its origin.

Frequent comings and goings,
Lost in confusion—
When shall I receive the gift of speech?

Suddenly, the true spirit appears before me.

Recognizing its original form,
I rejoice—
Incandescent and lucid,
Gazing upon its solemn essence,
Its radiant return,
Illuminating all with ease.

When seen, it is kept in secret,
In the profound subtlety of the Mysterious Dao.

Emerging from the perfect light,
The Five *Bān* hues,
Returning to their original auspiciousness.

---

*Subtracted-Character Plum Blossom*—
A farewell poem.

This mortal frame of Four *Jiǎ* [Illusions],
Though long-lived, will not escape decay.
Water burial for the fish,
Teach you—
Humanity’s *yè* [business] and bones are mere dice.

This return,
A single pearl of clarity—
Priceless.

True cultivation,
Steadying the *xiāoyáo* boundless boat,
Reaching the shore.

---

Self-composed ode:
My small name—eighteen,
Studying the *Xiào Jīng* [Classic of Filial Piety] through its chapters.

To celebrate the *Qīngcháo* [Pure Dynasty],
I dance the *Liù Wǔ* [Six Measures] before the wine.

The *Hú Lú* [Gathering] is always met,
Six dice—three lost in the game.
Foolishly, I am the first
To strike the drum in the *chóng* [clustered] crowd.

Seven years of the *hài* wind’s harm,
Awakening to the *Xīn Jīng* [Heart Sutra]—
No obstruction remains.

Trusting in the West and East,
South and North—
No division above or below.

The *Lónghuá* [Dragon Flower] Three *Huì* [Assemblies],
Silently recognizing the *xiáoyáo* [boundless] *guānzài* [observing] *Wúzàifú* [Self-So]ness.

To see true emptiness,
The *Yuánshǐ* [Original Beginning] *xūwú* [void] is my ancestor.

At the time of *Wǔjiǔ* [Five Nines],
The Dao’s use—
*Duéxiān* [Exiled Immortal]’s three cups of wine.

Gay banners and breezy elegance,
Demonstrating the *Nónggēng* [Agricultural Plough]’s *jìtǔniú* [striking the soil ox].

*Dōngjūn* [Eastern Sovereign]’s virtue is profound,
Freeing the mountain plum and riverside willow.

Cultivating the true essence,
A single pearl of clarity emerges from the Jade Tower.

Green mountains and verdant waters,
With the Daoist—
Long is the present intoxication.

Green waters and blue mountains,
Are the Daoist’s true leisure.

Bright moon and clear wind,
Seizing the boundless freedom—
Unspeakable.

Clear wind and bright moon,
Together are the Three—
I am one with them.

The heart, low or high,
Searching for the Mysterious Dao’s essence.

High or low, the heart descends—
At *yǒushàng* [10 PM], the East becomes the West.

The heart ascends, fire surges—
Lost in the *Sāntián* [Three Fields]’s *táng* [sugar] and honey.

Fire surges, the heart ascends—
The wheel of transmigration turns again.

The spirit is clear, the *qi* is refreshed,
Revelry in the tranquil—
Worthy of a single song.

The *qi* refreshed, the spirit clear—
Drumming out the voice from my origins.

Spirit clear, *qi* refreshed,
Nurturing the *huángyá* [yellow sprout]’s fate—
Aiding its growth.

*Qi* refreshed, spirit clear—
Recognizing the path ahead,
Its true essence.

---

*A Gift to Wang’s Drinking House*—
Cool broth must be prepared,
With skilled hands rolling it like snow in one’s grasp.

The broth prepared and cool,
Jade petals swirl into the precious pot.

Sliced finely with the knife,
In the bowl—silver threads and jade shavings.

Finely sliced with the knife,
Further divided—
The *bìtáo* [plum]’s green hues.

---

*Transforming Ragged Silk*—
Long dwelling by the sea,
A robe of silk is not needed for warmth.

By the sea, long dwelling,
The mortal frame’s nature is naturally temperate.

I pray for your care,
Turning many into one for praise.

Praise for your care,
Nurturing the *xiān tāi* [immortal embryo],
Granting ease and expansion.

---

*Wandering Waves*—
A poem for the *Táng Xiùcái* [Tang Scholar] seeking *Chūn* [Spring]’s chill and *Qiū* [Autumn]’s heat.

**《气色》**
Qi’s hues clash in ceaseless interplay—
Four seasons blend without distinction.
Above congeals, below emits—
Two forces grind in mutual friction.

Warmth deceives cold, cold presses warmth,
Their shifts resist all firm decree.
Like fleeting splendor, men pursue their fate—
Gaining warmth, they court the baneful chill.

Wealth and poverty, heat and cold—
All shift like waves in sand’s embrace.
Harmonious qi seeks to ascend,
Yet cold’s dark weight drags it down.
Cool clarity within may yet surge,
But outer flames suppress its flight—
Spring’s chill, autumn’s stifling steam.

Yin ascends, yang surges bright,
Yang delights, yin swells in turn.
Men boast their strength at life’s decline—
Heaven darkens just before the dawn,
Fate and fortune intertwine.

---
**《叹虚》**
*Oh, the Void’s ethereal drift!*
Stone-fire spares no fleeting spark,
Lightning wraps in flame’s fierce burn.
A hundred years—like bubbles burst
In water’s grasp. Life’s flash and fade,
Like wind-torches, burns too fast.

You dwell in vain, in worldly dust—
Awaken! Seize the hollow bloom.
With wisdom’s lamp, dispel the oil of fate.
Its radiance burns eternal, bright and clear,
Reflecting back the sacred sprouts.

Men must grasp the golden seed—
Yet cling to fleeting, gaudy bloom.
The mundane, once transcended, becomes the Dao.
All things, once touched, dissolve—
What need for infantile delight?

Penglai’s glow shines through mist and haze,
Emerald vapors, crimson clouds.
In the Ever-Spring Garden, sacred blossoms bloom.
Though veiled in dimness, light remains—
Cease your boasts, and rest in stillness.
*Mùshān’s* stream winds on.

---

For these are but fleeting illusions.

He avoids all worldly dust—
Every trifle, he shuns.

**自然萧索，寂寞与他依**
Thus, he dwells in serene desolation,
In quietude, aligned with emptiness.

**餐残饭，着粗衣**
Feasting on leftovers,
Wearing coarse robes—

He abides in boundless openness,
Nurturing his mortal form with steadfast care.

Like gold dredged from water’s depths,
He moves with the ebb and flow.

**旋旋被风吹，便生灭**
Swiftly, winds scatter him—
Life and death arise in turn.

**暂无还有**
For a moment, he lingers—
**忽亡忽聚，遄速没人知**
Then vanishes or gathers, unseen by any.

**如浮世，不坚牢**
Like this transient world,
He is not steadfast.

**名利难长久**
Gains and glory fade too soon.

**诸公早悟，休要迷花酒**
All noble ones, awaken early!
Do not be ensnared by beauty’s fleeting allure.

**养聚气和神，更认取、三光灵秀**
Nourish *qi* and spirit in harmony,
And know the Three Lights’ refined essence—
**朝昏调摄**
Balancing them at dawn and dusk,
**保护结金丹**
Guard them to forge the Golden Elixir.

**添真莹，放明光**
Augmenting true clarity,
He emits bright radiance—
**永得逍遥寿**
And attains eternal, carefree life.

**〔浣溪沙〕**
*Huàn Xī Shā*

**空裹追声枉了贤**
Chasing echoes in emptiness—
A scholar’s futile labor.

**水中捉月事同然**

**隔靴抓痒越孜煎**

**劝人认取裹头人**
How fervent the pursuit!

---

**江梅引**
*Jiāng Méi Yǐn*

**宁海范明叔邀饭览月桂花**
Brother Fàn Míngshū of Nínghǎi invites me to a meal,
Beneath the moonlit *guìhuā* tree.

**凌晨静至乐倍**
At dawn’s approach, the stillness doubles my delight,
**倚栏隈，观奇材**
Leaning on the railing,
I behold its marvelous form.

**正是蟾宫余影世间来**
The moon’s last light descends—
**遂得睛空甘露力**
I gain the void’s nectar,
**润根荄，发修条，伟又瑰**
Moistening its roots,
Unfurling its branches—
How grand and rare!

**能绽粉苞加红艳**
It bursts with pink petals,
**按周天，四序开**
Following the cosmic cycle,
Blooming through all seasons—
**蕊撒黄金，腾馥郁、道眼堪猜**
Its stamens scatter gold,
Its fragrance ascends—
A sight for Daoist eyes alone.

**岂许姿陆地、混尘埃**
Who would allow such grace
To be buried in earthly dust?
**呼取好风同引去**
I summon the finest breeze,
**上瑶台，复灵根，月裹栽**
To lift it to the Celestial Terrace,
Where its spirit thrives—
Planted in moonlight.

「When one recognizes the wondrous Dao of the rare and distant *Xīyí* realm,
It is naturally—
A state of **no vexation, no sorrow**.

Wife, son, grandson, granddaughter,
All entangled in endless affection.

Yet bound by *yù* (prison) and *yīn* (mountain of debt),
I clutch my body tightly—
Seized and held fast.

If one seeks to refine oneself into such **playful perfection**,
One must **wield the wisdom-blade**—
Sharpen it often,
And strike it repeatedly.

Even a **ten-thousand-catín iron chain** will shatter.

I pay tribute to Master Liú,
And awaken to my own **golden rooster’s call**.

**Grateful for the Sovereign’s Grace**—
In the tenth month of *Dīnghài* (1747), the Master wished to transform *Mǎ Yuè* (Horse Moon),
So for a hundred days he sealed the gate,
Desiring that *Yuè* witness the family’s **Daoist discipline** and thus comply.

A hundred days the gate of the *ān* (hermitage) was sealed,
*Mǎ Yuè* was taken and bound—
In the tranquil stillness,
Both true and false *qi* were cultivated.

I alone sigh and ponder,
**How such ease could be attained.**

My kin know well,
**How pure and refined** it is.

There is another kind—
**Distinct and clear like fine art**,
Again and again I lift it forth,
Temporarily to hang.

To behold it fully,
One must pay a **price of ten-thousand *hú* (斛) of pearls**.

At that time, I would pass it down—
A few words.

**The *Ruì* (auspicious) *Zhì* (crane)**—
In *Chángchūn* (Eternal Spring), the scenery lasts forever,
In the **land of eternal night**,
It never sleeps.

**At ease and unhurried**, except for my own thoughts,
**Roaming freely**, who could restrain it?

Only knowing **beyond the world is the world itself**,
**Gazing within the heavens reveals another heaven**.

**Five-colored clouds** forever as its companion,
**Golden flowers** encircle the *Dàluótiān* (Great Lotus Heaven).

**Do not refine the outward form**—
Only **kindle the crimson heart within**.

From this point, one may **generate fire from wood**,
Naturally **nurturing gold from water**.

**The *Yáo* (jewel) *Fāng* (fragrance) tree** and its kindred guard,
**Jade leaves and gem branches** intertwine.

**Do not seek companions elsewhere**,
For **this alone is the true resonant voice**.

Which **Daoist cultivation** is refining the **gold elixir**?
Only when refined does one **know the two affairs are complete**.

**Seven returns** must not open the **four gates**,
**Nine rounds** should turn the **three fields**.

**Qi and spirit** intertwined form the treasure,
**Luminous nature** clearly reveals the **Great Sage**.

Today, it returns to its **origin’s path**,
Naturally **pure and tranquil** forevermore.

**Lamenting the Yellow Flower**—
Yesterday, drunk with wine,
I was bound at the elbow.

On the bridge,
I fell into a **sudden downpour**—
**Mocking laughter**.

No one to help me,
Wife and children **none would save**.

I awaken suddenly—
**My kin have cursed themselves.**

**The Unattached Youth**
The willow droops in vain for me,
The blossoms bloom for none but her.
My wife—oh, my wife—
A painted dog of false pretence.
I guard the dike with care,
Lest it breach and spill my breath.
That wretch, Wang San,
Should never walk this path again.

When the bean leaves turn yellow,
I’ll repay the worthy and brave—
Let them leave this world soon.

The **Lingjing** landscape is pure,
Cool and serene, a perfect dwelling.
It opens the **Gate of Eternal Life**.
Then take up practice with true **virtue/power** and true **Daoist cultivation**,
And the **Luminous Nature** will shine forth.

The maiden rides the dragon,
The babe straddles the tiger.
They trade **pearls and jade**,
Tossing them aside for fleeting gain.
Yet here is the realm of **free and easy ease**—
A single **gold elixir** (*mingming jindan*), radiant as gold mirror and gold glow, gathered tight.

The **Sacred Gourd**—
This gourd holds **spirit/qi** divine.
Awake and clear, **incandescent and lucid**,
I grasp the **free and easy ease** true.
With **head and mouth** wrapped in its grace,
I chant the **Daoist scriptures** without cease.

I take the **good karmic causes**,
And fill my belly with them.
Pure and clear, they turn to **purity’s flow**.
With **jade staff** in hand, where shall I go?
I follow my **Master**—
**Clouds and waters** mark my path.

**The Foolish Guolang**
Someone asks: *"How can one escape the heart of hatred and love?"*
The deeper the hatred, the more it grows,
The more one loves, the greater the folly.
Both weigh on the mind—
How does one resolve them?
When others rejoice, I take it as my own delight,
When others suffer, I feel it as my own affliction.
The heart becomes a single mass—
Each erodes the other.

Guolang’s **sloth** (*màn*)
Dissolves the silver mist,
Sweet rain forming pearls of dew.
He summons the **Clear Wind**,
**Qi and spirit** aiding him.
Then he **invites the Order**—
To guard and follow close,
To treasure the **Three Fields** (*sān tián*),
And gather the **Nine-turn elixir** (*jiǔ zhuàn língdān*).

Before the **Azure Void**,
Jade mushrooms and golden trees sprout in abundance.
The **Lingming Flowers** (*yáohuā*) bloom,
Filling the sky with countless fragrance.
The **Luminous Blossoms** (*qióng yì*) unfold,
Their jade petals exhaling sweet perfume—
Right in the midst of this scent,
A single point of light resides.

**Free and easy ease**—
Serene and unrestrained, he walks.
With **spirit staff** in hand,
His wide sleeves sway at leisure.
The **colored clouds** swirl around,
And distant fragrant breezes,
With emerald mists, coax him near.
He lifts his head—
And suddenly beholds a **radiant vision**, ever more refined.
Sees the **Green Robes** half in the air,
Waving him forward.
He calls to me: *"Do not part—follow me!"*
And points to the **white clouds’ depths**,
Where **Daoist immortals** dwell.

**The Deep Gratitude**
My **Master** once said:
I once carried a **gourd of wine** from the **Sweet River**,
Heading back to my **hermitage**,
When I met a **Master** who asked:
*"Would you share your wine with one struck by the wind?"*
I gave it to him.
The **Master** drank it all,
Then ordered me to fill the gourd with river water.
I did so and gave it back.
He returned it to me,
Saying I should drink.
I drank—and it was **nectar of the Dao**.

How much wind-water was drunk?
From this, the **mysteries of the Dao** were revealed.
A **white linen robe** and **blue silk headband**,
Fitting him perfectly—truly **spirited**!
No need for a mirror to behold his face,
For all things are clear in his mind.

In dreams, he sees the **true self** beyond dreams,
And thus is he **free and easy**, crossing to the **other shore**.

---

**Again—The Master’s Practice**
He stokes the furnace,
Burning out the **cool and serene vision**,
Seizing the **gale’s shadow**.
Lightly, he fills it with **free and easy ease**—
The **heart-moon** shines clear beyond the void.

From the start, he **vows with clarity**,
Heeding the **Celestial Decree**.
A **Daoist chant** calls him—
Now he may return to the **elixir’s celestial heights**.

**Free and Easy Ease #3**
If one would **Daoist cultivation** seek,
One must **search with utmost care**.
Lock tight the **Golden Pass** and **Jade Gate**,
Let **upper** and **lower** merge in harmony,
Their **positions** exchanged, **irrigating** and **nourishing**.
Then comes the **afterbirth**—
Awake and **lucid**, yet still they **guess and debate**.

They enter the **Azure Void**,
And cast aside the **root and stalk**.
**Radiance** gleams in the **silver mist’s realm**,
Fresh as **jade’s hue**,
The **true spirit** luminous and smooth.
Clear and pure, they **pierce the void**—
Fine as the **filaments of silk**.

They cast off the **muddy wine**,
And drink the **transmitted clear water**.
This **taste**—
**Fragrant, sweet, and truly divine**.

---

**Over the Towered Hall**
No trace of dross remains—
The **Five Gates** open, **irrigating** with **sharp clarity**.
The **Seven Treasures** flourish, the **Three Fields** nourished.
With **tenfold mastery**, **knife and pill** blend in secret.
A **true crystal** forms—**radiant and resplendent**.
On **mountain peaks**, **wind and moon** invite transcendence.

**Temporary Respite by the River**
Each day’s practice is but fleeting—
Today, **sudden ease** unfolds.
**Yin and Yang** merge in **harmonious clusters**.
Like **baby to maiden**, **tiger coiled with dragon entwined**,
The **Four Symbols** copulate, **spinning jade threads**,
Piercing through the **Golden Elixir** in one stroke.
**Natural brilliance** emerges from the **muddy sphere**.
Words fail to capture—
Silence speaks no fault.

---
**The Old Gourd Master’s Song**
*(A gourd he carried, ever filled with wine)*
Through streets he wandered, day by day,
Who knew this gourd’s **true worth**?
**Fine wine** needs no purchase—
Drunk daily, never empty.
**Body’s work** now fully done,
**Spirit** stays—**never parting**.
With staff in hand, he sails the **rivers and lakes**,
A **boat of wind and moon**, **eternal clouds unfurled**.

**Tying the Cloud-Waist #4**
*(Self-Composed)*
At **Zhongnan’s peak**, **Zhongyang** stands—
**True freedom**, most **free and easy**.
With **clear wind and bright moon** as constant companions,
**Echoing spirits** call—
Beyond the void, **refined**, **rich in resonance**.
The **Penglai path** is often trod,
Only to **visit ancient sages**—**Qing and Hao**.
**Crimson clouds and emerald mists** gather thick,
Riding the **light breeze**, **cloud-waist tied high**,
Ascending to the **Azure Heights**.

**The Guest of Immortals**
To **cultivate** is to **search**—
For **true clarity**, **true stillness**, **true heart’s gain**.
This side **verdant**, that **snow-white**,
A **blackened crown**, **crimson above**.
Together they dwell in **lapislazuli halls**,
**Jade-petal flowers** folded in **celestial bloom**.
**Jade Boys sing**, **Golden Boys clap**—
**Heaven’s chosen**, **mountains their home**.
This **breakthrough**—
First the **breakthrough**, then the **Guest of Immortals** revealed.
To **see through** is to **know through**—
Look again, and **my belly splits open**.
How to **do**? Just **as it is**—
Why **nap at noon** like a fool?
What’s said? What’s done?
**Hidden in self**, **alone in practice**.
This **harmful wind**—
**Heart already broken**, **no ordinary discipline**.
No **calamity**, no **misfortune**—
**Seeking nothing**, **no ink-stained scholar’s toil**.
**Great Immortals chant**, **True Ones respond**,
In the **Full Perfection Hall**, **no smoke nor flame**.
**Worry-Free Child**, with **three companions**,
**Sudden coolness**—**free, at ease, seated**.

**Lament for the World’s Delusion**
□ Worthy of lament are the world’s people—
□ who would dare to gaze heavenward, to seek the Dao?»

**On the Wandering of the Northern Dipper and Southern Pole**
The Northern Dipper and Southern Pole shift day and night,
A flying hare and rabbit flee their bounds.

Yet still you are tormented by this world,
Still grasping at greed and jealousy.
Soon will the **Yingzhou** (Underworld) summon you,
What words shall you plead?

No need to rush your cultivation,
There will be those who come to meet you.
Already bound with white clouds as companions,
Ever composing verses and rhyme.

Wrap yourself in stillness, turn to serene ease,
Joy returns as you gaze upon the light.

A youth in green stands before you,
Presenting the **Ledger of Longevity** (长生簿).

**Fisherman’s Defiance**
Leaping free from the cage of the mundane to seek true life,
The human heart ever craves the tranquil and the pure.
This is the swiftest path to true cultivation.
Through **Chan** (禅) and **dhyana** (定), observe the void’s vast expanse.
Awaken to the **original nature** (祖宗), ever more alert—
Flame-red, blazing like the **golden essence** (金定).
Gradually, the radiant light becomes clear and bright.
The **Perfect Ones** (通贤) and **Sages** (圣) tread the path of **non-birth** (无生) with steadfast virtue.

**To My Nephew Yuan Bi and Yuan Zuo After My Brother’s Departure**
My brother Yuan Bi came before, aiding you both,
Honoring our elders—do you still remember this?
Yesterday, I laughed as your heart turned to clarity.
Do not despair, for in time I shall surely arrange your fate.
This **transmission** (这个) comes only from this **transmission**—
How can one escape the cycle of birth and death?
Leave graves, abandon ancestral mounds, break free from bonds.
Avert calamities, for on the path of **non-birth** (无生) all becomes cause and effect.

Who knows if **King Wang** (王三) can trade in the Dao?
Where the **Dao-heart** (道心) stands firm, retreat is impossible.
Ever wear the **Three Lights** (三光) with reverence.
With reverence worn, you rend the world’s net and dwell beyond dust.
The wind brings harm as it takes its course—
Today, seek no blame in those who come for coin.
You have gained the **freedom of the carefree** (逍遥),
True **liberation** (自在)—
Carry the clouds and return to **Penglai** (蓬莱) to meet.

---

**To My Dao-Friend**
This **King Wang** (王风) bows in deep respect,
Pearls and water-rice feasts indeed worthy of envy.
Filled to the brim, his **pure qi** (白气) shines forth.
His **pure qi** shines—
Today, I ask only of the **lotus petals** (梨花片).
When the time is ripe, they open fully;
After my words, their fragrance grows ever sweet.
High upon the tree, true **jade-like purity** (真玉) gleams,
True **jade-like purity** gleams—
Under the bright moon, it illuminates the **Pure Cool Pavilion** (清凉院).

---

**To Ning Sheng**
Calling forth **Third Brother’s wife, Ninth Sister** (三郎妻九姐),
Two **mulberry trees** (橡) merge into one dwelling.
Their bones become beams, their skin the tiles.
Do not boast—
Our parents have already guided them to their home.
I wish as a son to serve my family,
She wishes as a daughter to wed—
Uncle and aunt tend to their duties—when shall they cease?
Daily, the **offerings of merit** (功钱) are hard to repay.
Hear my words—
Long practice **filial piety** (孝顺) shall repay this debt.

---

**To the Dao-Friend from Jingzhao**
Seeking **obtainment** (得得) within **obtainment** (中间),
**King Wang’s silent verse** (默诀) is only for **King Liu** (王六).
If you seek purity like white jade,
Stay alone in retreat—
I alone must rid myself of **emotional desires** (情欲).
This **spiritual youth** (灵童) is bright as a candle,
Ever awake, able to sing the **Hymn of Non-Birth** (无生曲).
The **public** (公家) does not recognize him.
Do not seek him—
A **clear heart** (心澄) is the true message.

---

**At the Stone Gate Hermitage on Kunlun Mountain**
Entering **Stone Gate Mountain** (石门山) to dwell above,
Brothers’ hands and feet find no rest.
Three times a day, we meet in long embrace.
To the kitchen gone,
Chopping firewood, fetching water, stoking the pot—

---

**To the Dao-Friend from Jingzhao**
If you urge me to join the **rushing currents** (同流疾作) of worldly affairs,
Do not let even a spark of **delusion** (一点) cloud my heart.

I shall speak clearly one sentence:
Since **awakening** (开悟),
I dare not lightly reveal the **heavenly secrets** (天机).

At the **fifth watch** (五更), I leave the **hermitage** (舍),
Only to meet another **hermitage-leaving one** (出舍郎) in return—
Then the **wind** (便) rages wild.
**Success** (成功) is achieved,
Arriving at **Penglai** (蓬庄).
I repay that person with **clarity** (如惺悟),
Engaging in **profound discussion** (好商量).

At the **fifth watch** (五更), I depart—
Detailed and refined (细消详).
At the **first watch** (一更), *lo!* I meet a **hermitage-leaving one** (出会郎),
Far from my native home.
On the journey ahead,
I move with steady resolve.
First, I grasp the **dark tempest** (黑飙),
Sealing it within my **skin-bag** (皮囊).
Bound and secured,
It drifts no more.
At the **second watch** (二更), *lo!* I meet a **hermitage-leaving one** (出舍郎),
Transformed into **silver frost** (银霜).
Boiling water, burning fire—
A husband and wife bow in unison,
Entering the **Elixir Chamber** (丹房).
Sleeping together in retreat,
Lying on the **tooth-rack couch** (牙床).
At the **third watch** (三更), *lo!* I meet a **hermitage-leaving one** (出舍郎),
The most fitting time.
The **divine elixir** (神丹) is ready,
Nurturing the **child-mother** (养儿娘).
A perfect union of **yin and yang** (阴阳),
They ride in the **carriage** (车厢).
The **Golden Ox Boy** (金牛子),
Busy with his **elixir-carrying** (载搬忙).
At the **fourth watch** (四更), *lo!* I meet a **hermitage-leaving one** (出舍郎),
And find **cool refreshment** (清凉).
On the **multi-tiered pavilion** (重楼),
I drink the **Nectar of Heaven** (琼浆).
I dance and sing, awake or drunk,
Yet the more I taste, the sweeter it becomes.
The **true essence** (真滋味),
A thousandfold **fragrant heart** (万般香心).

At the **fifth watch** (五更), *lo!* I meet a **hermitage-leaving one** (出舍郎),
With **no defense** (没堤防).
**Unobstructed**, I pass through the **Bright Hall** (明堂).
A **radiant pearl** (明珠) rolls in the **imperial robes** (颠倒衮),
A **auspicious sign** (瑞中祥).
On Kunlun’s heights,
I release the **glow of clouds** (放霞光).
Recognizing the **Five Varieties of Hermitage-Leaving Ones** (五般出舍郎),
Their **black and white** (黑白) are revealed.
Among them, the **crimson** (赤) shines brightest,
With **emerald and golden** (青黄) hues interspersed.
*Lo!* *Lo!* *Lo!* *Lo!* *Lo!* (哩啰啰□哩啰哩),
The **wondrous Dao** (妙玄) is supreme.
When **perfectly refined** (玲珑了),
It **resonates like bells** (便玎珰).

---
**Ode to Chess** (丑奴儿#4)
Two players vie in skill, each boasting mastery,
Yet their paths **cross and conflict** (路路相违).
Move by move, they **deliberate** (子细挨依),
Only when the **end of the age** (劫尽) do they **break free** (解了围).
The **foolish and lost** (愚迷) fail to grasp the **double meaning** (双关意),
Each concealing their **hidden strategies** (藏机).
Who is right, who is wrong?
The **spectators** (傍观) smirk in cold amusement.

---
**On Confusion and Longing** (迷怀)
In the **marketplace** (廛中), there dwells a **practitioner** (修行子),
Yet he cannot leave the **fire-hearth** (火院).
Only when **pushed away** (推辞),
Does he **reluctantly turn back** (恁不回头), awaiting some day.

Today’s fate is not guaranteed for tomorrow’s,
And **the Great Termination** (大限) knows no one.
How **pitiful** (可) is this **foolishness** (愚痴),
Waiting in the **wild outskirts** (荒郊) to gnash his teeth!

Last night, I lay alone on the **ice-ridge path** (冰棱道),
Observing the **Three Radiances** (三耀).
With a **free and tranquil heart** (自在心安),
I feel the **cool refreshment** (清凉) yet not the cold.
The **tail-end of the river** (尾闾) flows past my **spine** (夹脊上),
Its **rolling waves** (辘辘) carry me along.
It **penetrates the mud pellet** (透入泥丸),
Returning **youth** (返老) and granting **longevity** (长生)—
A joy beyond compare.
The **people of Caoxi** (曹溪一路) struggle to **awaken** (难悟),
How could they abandon their **beautiful wives** (妍妻)?
Unable to bear **solitude** (孤俩),
At night, they sink deeper into **confusion** (越越迷).
Though the **path of longevity** (长生路) is clear,
Who among them can **ascend** (跻)?
What **eastern or western** (东西) methods?
Who dares **extract themselves** (抽身) from the **filthy mud** (污泥)?

If **common folk** (凡人) understand the **Three Radiances** (三耀),
They shall **form noble bonds** (结良缘).
When they **discover the true Dao** (真玄),
Only then do they **trust the Great Sage of Emptiness** (虚空出大仙).
A **single grain of gold elixir** (金丹一粒) must not be **wasted** (无为漏),
For it holds the **refined essence of anger** (怒精妍).
Its **luminous roundness** (明莹光圆),
A thousand **rays of cloud-glow** (万道霞光) ascend to heaven.
Like a **dream** (如梦), fleeting yet profound.

「Ninghai folk all wake to insight,
When shall we meet again like this?

Only may I **replenish the Golden Lotus** (重金莲),
And **nurture noble causes** (作做良因) with care.

**The way home, the way home** (归路),
Where **endless white clouds and emerald mists** (白云翠雾) fill the gaze.

---

**To the County Magistrate** (赠县令)
Daily here we feast and revel,
**Feasting on flesh** (食肉) while **virtuous officials gather** (诸公总善).
Only **Lord of the Harmonic Wind** (害风王) need not blame
My **frequent visits** (频来) to your presence.

**Magistrate, Magistrate** (知县),
Now is the time to **act with beneficence** (与人方便).

---

**In Response to a Friend’s Kind Words** (蒙友惠词)
The **Bright Moon** (明月) endures through ancient and modern times,
Yet how can **Huazong’s reckless tongue** (华宗海口) bear it?
Wrapped in **dark caves** (黑窟), my head abides,
**Gloom** (黯暗) knows no **night or day** (不分夜昼).

**My friend, my friend** (吾友),
How shall you **grasp the method** (如何下手)?

**Yangliu Branch** (杨柳枝)
**In a dream, I awaken to the lofty celestial moon** (梦悟青霄月正高),
**Plucking the coiled peach** (射蟠桃).
A **single white brushstroke** (一枝白笔) meets its fate,
**Yet also the blade** (更兼刀).

**Words flow like ink as they are penned** (应手诗词随写染),
**Guided by the wind of the *Cao*** (运风骚).
Upon **jade slips** (玉笺), **cloud-waves rise** (起云涛),
**Leisurely and unbound** (任陶陶).
A **breath’s duration** (一息) brings the **waning vital sphere** (衰气球),
**Unleashing the wind of elegance** (骋风流).
Do not come—**a breath’s absence shatters the sphere** (破胞抽),
**This time, rest** (这回休).

If you **still follow the old paths of Chang Jian’s trade** (常建贩),
**Begin anew** (复从头).
**Gather the vital sphere** (气重收), **wrap it close** (胞儿裹面),
**Again, refine and bend** (再罗偻).
Who **recognizes the golden well beyond the sky** (天边一井金)?
**Purple light invades** (紫光侵).
**Day after day, it confronts the eyes** (朝日朝日),
Yet **no one seeks it** (没人寻).
Only **I, in stillness, know its whereabouts** (静中知去处),
**Worthy of trust** (自堪任).
**Measure and weigh to enter the Pearl Forest** (尽斤尽两入珠林),
**Ascend the lofty peaks** (出高岑).

**Refining the Vital Essence** (捣练子)
**Monkeys ride horses** (猿骑马), **displaying wild chaos** (呈颠傻),
How can they be **seized and subdued** (难擒难捉)?
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**The wisdom-blade opens** (慧刀开), **all cut down** (齐下杀),
**Teach you to recognize the root and source** (认得根源也).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**Water and fire combined** (水兼火), **Kan and Li** (坎和离),
How can you **know their interplay** (消息怎生知)?
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**Cease refining, cease cultivation** (休烧炼，莫修持),
**For it is all these very things** (元来只是这些儿).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**Refining the Vital Essence** (捣练子), **Harmonic Wind Brother** (害风哥),
**A single body leaps beyond death and life’s waves** (一身跃出死生波).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**This is the true freedom of effortless ease** (便是逍遥真自在),
**No one restrains—trust the humming and sighing** (没人拘管信吟哦).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).

With **blade and compass** (用刀圭),
**Severing the confusion** (剖昏迷),
How can you **harmonize it all** (合和一处怎生携)?
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**Heads fall** (人头落), **rainbows appear** (现虹霓),
**White lotus blooms from green mud** (白莲花朵出青泥).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**The sea of fame, the river of strife** (名利海，是非河),
**Beyond the Harmonic Wind’s lofty slope** (王风出了上高坡).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**Ten years of merit, and the task is done** (十年功行满),
**Laughing beneath the deep white clouds** (白云深处笑呵呵).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**The Three Elixirs’ treasure** (三丹宝),
**Hard to divide and refine** (难分剖),
**In dimness, how can it be preserved** (默默怎生保)?
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).
**In the void, held in embrace** (在虚空，长怀抱),
**A crimson robe wraps the child, a new black hat** (绯衫裹子新乌帽).
**Oh-ho!** (哩啰□), **Oh-ho!** (哩啰□).

**Treading the Grass** (踏莎行)

**Treading the Grass** (踏莎行)

Do not boast of sons, nor praise your daughters,
For with the master, they bring harm to your fate.
Scraping fat and grease from others’ bones,
Only repaying debts from past lives’ sins.

Gilded halls delight the eye, yet pity stirs the heart—
Even iron fortresses crumble in time.
Many sins you’ve indulged in, now your own to bear,
When the eyes close, how will you wear the crown?

---
**Another Spring for Another House**
Wives and daughters, do not sigh,
Sons and grandsons, hold no grudge—
I have other friends in the clouds.

Free of shackles, my heart knows it well,
Cool realms revealed, only I see them.

Step by step, clouds deepen,
Bay by bay, waters shallow—
Fragrant winds spray my face wherever I go.

On Kunlun’s heights, I wander free,
Wrapped in mist and clouds, refining my essence.

---
**Self-Composed**
Gold misleads the mind, the mind controls gold—
Give and take, when does it end?
Even stubborn bronze wears away,
What use has mortal flesh to flee life and death?

Turn back early, seek the wondrous truth,
Carefully examine—do not speak without guidance.
Two paths open within the belly,
One bright point shines clear in the heart.

Mercury wraps the clear spring,
Lead holds fiery brilliance—
Pouring upside-down, spreading sweet dew.

Tiger’s roar shakes the Green Pole’s blue,
Dragon’s chant summons the White Tiger’s white.

Claim the true field, divide the paths,
Plant and pluck the golden peach yourself.
Jade boys bear it aloft in their palms,
At the jade feast, it may be shared.

The Dao without name, the harm of winds,
Wrapped in *Treading the Grass*, joy unfolds.
Step by step, refining brings it to birth,
Lotus steps follow, never parting.

Emerging from clear springs,
Surging to the Azure Void—
Forming clouds, gathering canopies, vast and grand.
Outer fragrance draws the radiant light,
Inner luminosity illuminates the true elixir.

Unrecognized, ashamed—
Seek guidance, let compassion arise.
After meals, do not waste your thoughts.
How dare doctors examine,
Or others weigh in—
The talisman’s water is the true seed.

*Lī□ līlū lī□ lī□,*
Forever walking toward Penglai’s jade halls.

---
**In Gratitude for a Gift**
Felt slippers left behind,
Wooden helmets shared—
With humble sincerity, I repay your kindness.

Endless feasts may be prepared,
A thousand flavors savored—
The tranquil sage, the pure bodhisattva,
All owe this to such gifts.

Wrap mercury and lead in your head,
Fill them fully—do not scatter.

---
**To a Friend**
Last year’s hemp, this year’s wheat—
One hemp, one wheat, passing the message.
Left, a golden cake—yang’s birth,
Right, a silver vessel—yin concealed.

No partiality, no inversion—
The heart-lamp shines, discerning fate.
Not strolling through Zhongnan’s streets,
But knowing the truth on Jingdong’s road.

---
**On Burning Incense**
The body is the censer,
The heart, the incense—
One essence, clearly divided.
Burning at the proper hour,
Piercing Kunlun’s peaks,
Incense curls into auspicious omens.

Rising to the cloudy heights,
Distinct and wondrous—
Forming clouds, gathering canopies, enfolding the mystery.
In the Golden Flower Hall, I wander free,
Beside the Jade Emperor’s seat, I attend.

---
**To a Friend**
One point of luminous clarity,
Two straight paths—
How to begin, how to act?
Teach me to bow toward Heaven’s hall,
Lest I stumble into the Underworld’s grasp.

The sun turns the Golden Rooster,
The moon births the Jade Rabbit—
All things in the cosmic net move in measure.
Do not cling to prolonged life,
But firmly grasp the golden essence.

---
**Kunlun’s Circular Hermitage**
The model is made,
Yet do not raise the beams—
How would the masters know my convenience?
Water talismans do not pass here,
But fate has led me to Wen’deng County.

Each must hold fast to cultivation,
Swiftly return to refining—
Its essence reveals itself to you.

Now gradually it aligns with the Mysterious,
Then often we meet face to face.

---
**Burning the Hermitage**
Years of toil, dwelling in Liu and Jiang,
Daily dust in the hermitage’s halls.
Suddenly, the true fire blazes open,
Burning it all to the supreme.

I urge all masters—
Do not grow disheartened,
For we have deeper truths to share.
Only the ashes remain, unvisited,
Penglai’s cloud paths open for passage.

Searching in sleep, acting in dreams,
Eyes closed, recognizing the true—ever joyful.
Imagine the Three Treasures as divine,
Forging the Nine-Turn elixir.
Gathering auspicious clouds,
Coming and going between Azure Void and earth,
Following and leading, only cranes and phoenixes remain.
White light in ten thousand rays springs from the garden,
Red light, one point, burns at the center.

*Volume Eight of the Complete Authentic Words of Chongyang*
Composed by Master Chongyang of Zhongnan, Wang Zhi.

**Volume Eight of the Complete Authentic Words of Chongyang**

**Coining Divination (卜算子) – Seeking a Friend (寻知友)**

Nine-nine’s mysteries now revealed in speech,
The bright moon clearly shines upon the jade pool.
True insight into the double meaning’s essence,
The first three threes and the last three threes.

Nine-nine’s words must be corrected,
Refining the original nature to its primal source.
Only return to yang from yin,
And resolve to pure, elegant chanting.

O Virtuous Ones, O Virtuous Ones,
Grant me leave to compose *As If in a Dream (如梦令)*.

Nine-one’s chill begins with inherent cause,
The winter *qi* freely unfurls and expands.
There, the fierce cold of the southern lands congeals,
Just as the mid-winter node arrives.

Hidden wonders, hidden wonders,
Within lies the new yang’s subtle emergence.

Nine-two’s austere yin is piercing,
White snow spread far along its edges.
Yet still it nourishes the numinous root,
Guiding the yellow sprouts to thorough examination.

As such, as such,
The Northern Sea’s divine tortoise drinks freely.

Nine-three’s cornered *qi* accumulates,
The water’s face entirely frozen.
This nature’s firmest and most steadfast,
Unfaltering brilliance radiates outward.

Afar it sends, afar it sends,
Reflecting light to distant horizons.

Nine-four’s cold wind like an arrow,
Its might pervades all with ease.
Chasing these demons in flight,
Praise the auspicious one who sees them fall.

Worthy of envy, worthy of envy,
Hidden yet revealed—one radiant expanse.

Nine-five’s Heavenly Pool fully unfrozen,
The gentle scene now inviting.
Observe the ridge-top plum blossoms,
Warming, already luxuriant.

Incense table, incense table,
Monopolizing true yang’s half.

Nine-six’s *qi* expands and clarifies,
Ascending and descending, harmonizing.
Flowing universally, it now reveals,
The Daoist Sage’s virtue and noble worth.

Patterns and threads, patterns and threads,
Ready to unfurl jade petals, precious blooms.

Nine-seven’s gates open to eight veins,
Piercing through forever, no separation.
Like exhaling misty vapors,
Revolving ceaselessly in pristine whiteness—
Unfathomable, unfathomable,
One point at the center, terrifying.

Nine-eight’s harmony is complete,
All things now aligned and balanced.
Light shines everywhere,
Dazzling, ever more brilliant—
Connecting, connecting,
Lengthening into jade branches, jade leaves.

Nine-nine’s eightfold seal is locked,
Gathering light like fire.
Flames form crimson clouds,
Enveloping the face—heaven’s flowers are perfect.
Completed, completed,
One luminous pearl, radiant.

Nine-nine’s words now perfected,
Who else but Wang Zhi, named Zhe?
The refined name knows its brilliance,
The Daoist title *Chongyang* is distinct.

Joyous, joyous,
One grain of golden elixir forever sealed.

**West River Moon (西江月) – Four Falsehoods (四假)**

Worthy of lament: fire-wind, earth-water,
For them, form is forged.
They teach humans suffering through daily scriptures,
Plunging them into perfumed visions and sounds.
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Morning after morning, dwelling in the Yellow Court.
Naturally silent and serene, the true spirit gathers.
Five-colored clouds of light enfold and settle.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四民)**

Worthy of lament: farmers, artisans, merchants, laborers,
Each boasts skill in their own trade.
Within, clever schemes multiply,
Yet still they vie in empty strife.
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Clinging to simplicity and plainness.
Clear as still water, firm as ice,
Their own fruit of perfection is assured.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四害)**

Worthy of lament: lust, greed, wealth, *qi*,
The world is long ensnared by these.
All seek them like roasted fowl,
Their minds clouded, their wisdom lost.
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Content to endure solitude and sorrow.
In coarse robes, plain food, and yellow pickled greens,
I cultivate the embryo of the transcendent.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四方)**

Worthy of lament: east, west, south, north,
Misguided travelers suffer.
Come and go as they will in red dust,
Drawn only by fame and gain.
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Within stillness, my essence is fixed and true.
Refined and gathered, *qi* and spirit harmonize,
Forever joyous in the natural and unadorned.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四时)**

Worthy of lament: spring, winter, autumn, summer,
Strange flowers and plants vie to bloom.
The passing years unnoticed, urging on,
What use is regret when it’s too late?
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Chasing inner virtues, ever near.
Green, red, yellow, white, black—pure and bright,
The true gold is forged, resounding.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四宝)**

Worthy of lament: brush, inkstone, paper, ink,
Binding fate with rules and schemes.
Ordinary scribbles always become texts,
Called the "literary quarters" with annotations.
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Commanding the Great Record to trace its origins.
One spark of spirit unfurls at will,
Returning to true suchness, gazing back.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四物)**

Worthy of lament: chess, calligraphy, music, painting,
Empty pleasures to delight the eye and soothe the heart.
Within, these numinous things are scorned,
How can they ever grasp life’s true meaning?
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
With fate, I sift out the nameless.
On the path of eternal life, perfection is proven,
Beyond the void, spirit-light subtly glows.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四景)**

Worthy of lament: wind, flowers, snow, moon,
The world’s affections cling to these.
Pursuing joy and admiration, when will it cease?
They fail to see the yin’s just reward.
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Searching for mysteries profound.
Luminous, the cause is revealed,
Precisely my family’s inherent grace.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四渎)**

Worthy of lament: Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji rivers,
Endless currents deceive the foolish.
Floods and waves meet the sky’s paths,
Only flowing from west to east.
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Rolling jade nectar, precious essence.
Three fields irrigated, forming pearls,
Seven treasures’ peak—there I reside.

---

**Four Falsehoods (四苦)**

Worthy of lament: birth, old age, sickness, death,
The world’s great afflictions, vast and dire.
Alas, the bitter and the sour only deepen,
How can one escape this fate?
Only I shake my head, unmoved,
Even now, I’ll grant them this.
Within the jade flowers’ cluster, I behold the precious science,
Five-colored clouds—there I sit, unshaken.

**Refining the Elixir**

Split and refined into purple rays of gold,
A thousand flowers bloom in myriad brocades.
Drink the clear light—smooth yet spicy,
Feast on fruit—soft, fragrant, and sweet.
Two methods daily refined and added,
Eight flavors given at their proper time.

Stroll the six streets with careless ease,
Seek the seven treasures in adorned splendor.
Three fields turn ninefold like silver rabbits,
One essence, solitary and verified.

Humans must cultivate with fierce resolve,
My heart cleansed—now nothing remains.
Do not waste vital strength in vain exertion,
Let the true and pure gradually emerge.

White snow transforms into a radiant maiden,
Yellow buds nurture the infant within.
Two signs—who can comprehend?
Awakening reveals it clearly.

Drink the clear light—smooth yet spicy,
Feast on meat—soft, fragrant, and sweet.
The world’s delusions know no end,
Each faces perilous paths ahead.
Only I, awakened, stand apart,
Leaving only regret behind.

Tenfold precepts refined, ever stricter,
No trace of *táng* remains to be refined.
Awakening reveals noble descendants,
Seizing robes and seizing feasts alike.

Laughing, rejoicing, grieving, resenting—like roaring wolves and tigers,
Yet they dwell not with me in chaos.
Turn back, and I bear you in my green embrace.
Let the cloud-steps guide you to the Three Teachings of Mao.

**Song of the Incense Offering (行香子)**

**First Watch—Water Phase Incense**
The drum first sounds—water’s virtue ascends.
Behold the tortoise, auspicious on the waves.
Full breath, eyes dazzlingly clear,
Diving the pure tide, riding the limpid waves,
Hidden yet the river’s form.
Black mist swirls, filling the skin-bag.
Sealed tight, yet drifting upward.
Harmonizing above and below, flowing at the edges.
Then it becomes mist, forming a canopy,
Accumulating as frost.

**Second Watch—Metal Phase Incense**
The second watch begins—gold’s virtue ascends.
The tiger cub ascends, the infant prince sits.
A white blade hangs at his waist, a green steel rod in hand.
He drives away a hundred demons,
Slays a thousand, dooms ten thousand.
Net of forests spreads wide, silver rays emitted.
The Dipper’s handle aligns, the Azure Dragon’s star ascends.
In the southwest’s place, fragrant virtue revealed.
Good roots bloom, kind roots unfold, auspicious roots flourish.

**Third Watch—Fire Phase Incense**
The third watch begins—fire’s virtue ascends.
The moon’s first phase, illuminating the heart-king.
Scarlet and radiant, dazzling and resplendent.
The original true birth, the enlightened spirit, the supreme true guide.
Threefold balance, one path of ease.
Gazing at the azure sky, auspicious mists unfurl.
Spread horizontally and vertically, encompassing round and square.
Early he plays with the jade ring,
Holding the jade tablet, grasping the jade blade.

**Fourth Watch—Wood Phase Incense**
The fourth watch begins—wood’s virtue ascends.
The Azure Dragon ascends, a graceful maiden sits.
Her breath emits crimson qi, her robe is scarlet.
She wears jade flowers, feasts on jade petals,
Drinks jade nectar.
Coming and going in harmonious delight,
Yin and yang reversed.
The *Mao* stem opens, the sun’s brilliance shines.
The great pearl dims, the luminous flame passes through the Hall of Light.

**Fifth Watch—Earth Phase Incine**
The fifth watch completes—earth’s virtue ascends.
It gathers the four symbols within itself.
Now fully revealed, centered in the middle.
White returns to green, red to black—none to yellow.
Vacuity proven, then it flees from Kunlun’s peak.
The Golden Boy arrives, secret teachings proclaimed.
The Heavenly Sovereign decrees, granting wind’s madness.
Ever in leisure, ever serene, ever cool.

---

**Self-Composed Verse**
There was a King San, wind-mad and deranged.
Abandoning honor, begging first for alms.
Mountains of kindness, seas of love—all fiercely discarded.
No flowers planted, no medicines brewed, no fields tilled.
Fallen yet obsessed, sleeping wherever he lands.
Awakening to coolness, boundless realms unfold.
Penglai’s path secure, each step in cloud and sky.
True joy within truth, truth within delight, delight within mystery.

---

**To a Disciple**
Again you seek new verses, no hidden heads to write.
Plainly stated, the reason revealed:
Gentlemen unenlightened, yet still they seek.
Lost in worldly affairs, when will it cease?
Awaken to the mystic principle, grasp the method of cultivation.
After the elixir’s completion, essence and spirit refined.
The path ahead is steady—Sanzu Islands, Ten Thousand Isles.
Turn back early, and we shall journey together.
If you wish to cultivate, follow this path:
True compassion, boundless wisdom.
Honor parents above, cherish children below.
When jade flowers bloom, their petals drift,
Drinking jade nectar.
Building a golden garden, erecting a jade hall.
This Red Youth ever burns incense in his heart.
His voice resounds, his nature chimes.
Thus attaining cool clarity, pure purity, serene coolness.

To drink the fragrant elixir, spit out all cloying thickness.
With the Flower Pool’s waters, divine essence combined,
Irrigating east and west, refining above and below.
Then the stars appear, the bright moon, the radiant sun.
Gradually entering harmony, only then does sweetness reveal.
The precious vessel forms—no need for pounding and refining.
In leisure, stillness deepens, tranquility embraces calm.
Dwelling in clear skies, beyond all things, atop the mountain’s peak.

**Obtaining the Dao**
Obtaining the Dao, obtaining the Dao—
Naturally hidden in the jade cave’s cloud-palace.
The jade precepts and spirit symbols refresh the pure qi,
The golden elixir’s medicine outshines silk robes.
Not like worldly men, light and frivolous,
Boasting of gold and silver in their chests.
My treasure, the Three Fields ever turning,
My family’s one essence, never in alarm.

January’s cold retreats gradually,
Nine-petaled spirit flowers bloom eastward.
When jade nectar flows, it benefits the vital breath,
When the precious herb is gathered, life is reborn.
Nurturing the Double-Qing’s radiant faces,
Peach-blossom cheeks smile with jade hairpins.
The seven spirits and three corpses depart with the winter solstice,
The five directions and nine turns arrive with spring.

February knows the water’s harmony,
Wind stirs the wood virtue naturally.
*Wuwu* transforms, giving birth to the inner maiden,
*Yiyi* smiles, killing the moon’s fair one.
Bright and clear, the river of the world—
I turn back, emerging from the high slope.
Thirty-six thousand deities gather,
Twelve-layered towers, ten thousand streams of essence.

---

Three months, Qingming’s clarity banishes all smoke,
A hundred flowers bloom radiant beneath the sun’s embrace.
Maiden Maqia gathers by the fresh fire’s glow,
Infant children play by the old pond’s edge.
A precious mirror hangs before my chest,
Old and young unite—auspicious bonds take root.
The Vermilion Bird ascends on clouds, distinguished among all,
The Azure Dragon rides the mist, achieving lofty ascent.

Four months, the Vermilion’s harmonious qi clears,
The heart’s seven treasures bloom ever more distinct.
When you understand, speak alone to yourself,
Do not covet the cries of a hundred birds, O Sage.
Flames stretch slender, gradually taking form,
From this point, all ten thousand trees earn their noble names.
Among the Ten Celestial Stems, I alone advance,
Within the Five Phases’ palaces, I lead the way.

Five months, the sun’s fervent qi thrives,
Now is the time to sit upright and question Nan Hua.
This one cannot praise the Liver-Wood’s excess,
That person favors planting the Heart’s flower.
All vexations vanish—no distant sighs or lamentations,
At noon’s zenith, I stand unyielding, never askew.
The Jade Hare passes, adding to the white snow,
The Golden Rooster appears, spouting yellow sprouts.

Six months, Pure Yang fully enters the domain of the Recluse,
Yin demons are driven back from the streets.
Ren-Gui’s Northern Waters nourish the Kidney’s essence,
Bing-Ding’s Southern Peak kindles the true incense.
Ghosts and fiends, all busied in their schemes,
The assembled horde cannot muster defense.
After the hour of Zi, days grow short—
Before Chen, nights stretch long.

Seven months, the sea’s depth at Geng-Xin,
A single wheel of moonlight governs the celestial heart.
When rice is cooked, know the fire must be fed,
When garments are made, the thread must follow the needle.
Crafting the Seven Treasures of Non-Action,
I command today’s essence to endure until now.
When the White Tiger roars, I seize it often,
Where the Black Tortoise treads, I turn to seek it.

Eight months, the pure dew of clear autumn,
All people at ease, nurturing their true bodies.
Obscure and distant, guests beyond the clouds,
Dim and silent, those who dwell within the moon.
Though dwelling in dust, I am unstained by it,
Nor do I harbor joy, anger, or wrath.
Having attained effortless ease, my body gleams smooth,
Naturally parting and gathering, shedding old skin.

Nine months, the crisp qi of the azure sky ascends,
Layered towers descend with a shower’s gentle rain.
The Red Dragon stirs the sea in true freedom,
Wooden Horses gallop with the wind—never empty.
Each strike in the dust forges my waist,
A six-chun robe hangs, surpassing crimson decay.
Drunk, I sprawl upon the green brocade couch,
Awake, I pluck the jade herb’s tender shoots.

Ten months, the red frost returns, ever clearer,
The Yellow Mother half-submerges in the deep abyss.
When the Celestial Stem is exhausted, only I remain vigorous,
Reborn with divine qi—who else could hear?
The warp must come before the weft,
Only then can the patterned silks be woven.
When the Fire phase departs, red peonies bloom,
When the Water phase descends, rain pours in torrents.

Eleven months, the stern wind wields its might,
The moon’s jade flees, the sun’s gold takes flight.
Binding the Three Threes into treasures,
Donning the Six Sixes’ six-chun robe.
Riding the Phoenix, clutching the Mandarin Duck, crossing mist to return,
Descending from heaven’s decree—no defiance.
With three thousand karmic ties fulfilled, all is exhausted,
Eight hundred deeds completed, dust is rare.

Twelve months, the tapestry of fortune is complete,
The four seasons’ branches and leaves wither not.
See how fire draws water within,
Naturally, water encases the furnace’s glow.
Dragon, Tiger, Tortoise, and Serpent align in breath,
All bones filled, standing in an instant.
One luminous pearl descends three times,
Three evils vanish, all at once.
Having obtained the sacred talisman, all matters are at rest,
A hundred grievances retreat—let others fret.
Drink the elixir to fill my belly’s depths,
Pour the golden marrow to crown my head.
All for the Ten Causes that led to this path,
Maqia and the infant dwell in intricate bonds.
Teach me to grasp the three straight blades,
Ask the Sage to recognize the single curved hook.
The crimson window’s distant five thousand words,
Two hundred characters—
Two kinds of hidden scriptures,
Divine and marvelous deeds.
Within the numinous, I perceive the profound,
Piercing the mystery, refining the gold elixir.
Obtaining the incandescent, all duality ceases.
In boundless ease, my vision unfolds,
Ascending beyond, forever fulfilled.
Together with the red clouds, I return with the rainbow’s hue,
Enveloped in auspicious omens.
At the fifth watch, the first watch begins,
The drum’s voice echoes—foolish and raw.

The hammer strikes—
monkey-mind and wild horses tamed.
Gently, gently—
each chime rings clear,
all at once subdued.

Ten thousand forms hang voidly suspended.
Flames blaze divine radiance,
incandescent, effulgent.
Bright light pierces
the Palace of the Precious Bottle—
the maiden blooms in tender grace.

At the second watch, the drum’s rhythm steadies,
evenly striking of its own accord.
Tiger and dragon shift in exchange,
qi, spirit, and essence
each dwelling in the Elixir Chamber—
no disorder remains.

Piercing through the layered towers,
this jade nectar, this ambrosial brew,
flows back and forth in irrigation.
Now must it
nurture forth the golden sprout,
gradually taking form in splendor.

At the third watch, the drum’s tone resounds true,
its resonant notes turning luminous.
Within, the clamor reveals the numinous root,
harmonizing with the Sage’s Dao and virtue.
Slowly circling the swift path,
the Silver Arrow’s message is strung into elegant verse.
With the arrow’s own tip—
its crimson core—
revealed in utter stillness, pure and clear.

At the fourth watch, the drum’s voice sharpens,
suddenly vibrating—
heavenly blossoms scatter.
Before me stands the True Person,
crowned with stars, draped in moon’s mantle.
This marvelous mystery brings auspicious fortune.
Gazing at the Dipper’s ladle star,
pointing true to the southwest.
Behold—
the jade blossoms gleam,
weaving auspicious omens.

At the fifth watch’s close, the drum grows leisurely,
stirred by that Person into inversion.
From the golden dish emerges the spirit-pearl,
casting myriad rays of crimson light.
Deep, dark, and truly wondrous.
From here, the path reconnects—
the primordial treasure.
Now, where shall it return?
Dwelling in the Ten Isles, the Three Isles.

*Rain of Dews* (玉楼春)
East’s *jia-yi* stems sprout green—
timely, as the seasons decree.
South Yang’s crimson flames blaze forth,
now fierce, dense, and thick.
West winds gold, rustling crisp,
brisk and drifting free.
North’s chill congeals in stern severity,
forming ice—auspicious, fortunate.

Guard the liver’s core, the lungs, the kidneys—
four gates open, luminous, all as one.
The Elixir’s axle stands beyond the void,
radiant, five lights shining forth.
Piercing the azure heights,
claiming only boundless ease, serene repose.
At this juncture, stillness is the way—
endless, unbroken, complete.

*From the Complete Works of Zhongyang Chongyangzi Wang Zhe, Volume 8*
#1 *This tune should be "Yulou Chun" (玉楼春).*
*Volume 9*

*Lyrics of the Song: The Clear and Awake Song*
The Dao of *Zhengyang* (正陽) is the lineage’s root,
*Pure Yang* (純陽) of Tang as my teacher.
*Yan Guo Hai Chan* (燕國海蟾) as my elder guide,
*Zhongnan Chongyangzi* (終南重陽) gathers disciples.

As disciples, we take refuge here,
Serving and honoring three masters, their sacred essence united.
Move, and the Four Spirits (四靈) radiant in divine hues coalesce;
Still, and the Ten Thousand Ways (萬道) shine with jade-like brilliance.

Attain boundless ease (逍遥),
True freedom (真自在),
Where the *Qingxu* (清虚) and *Xiaoxi* (消息) ever harmonize.

From the *Yuanchu* (元初) this cause began,
Since the beginningless *jie* (劫), no obstacle stands.
To call forth immortals (神仙),
Vague and mysterious, silent before.

Why not treasure this marvel as marvelous?
What else could be deemed profound?
By nature, the *Jing* (精) flows clear,
Thus enlightenment dawns—no need for talk or cultivation.

Why ponder arcane mysteries?
Why seek hidden formulas?
No increase, no decrease,
No birth, no death—no rising or falling.

Forever as companion to wind and moon,
Eternally with clouds and mists entwined.

*Song of the Bamboo Staff* (竹杖歌)
A single bamboo staff—*Wuzhuo* (無著) in name,
Each node glows with resplendent light.
Noble is its hollow core, straight and upright,
Its sheath encased with Elixir’s essence.

Unshaken, unmoved—ever at ease,
Adapting to all things with effortless grace.
Seeking friends upon the sea’s vast expanse,
Who can truly teach me refuge?

Last night in dreams I saw the *Qiu* (虬),
Within them four times leaping with vigor.
Staff raised once, foot stepped once,
A silver thread ascended from the crown.

Furrowed brows revealed, spirit invigorated,
A luminous pearl emitted, radiant and bright.
Joyous, plucked from the azure heights,
The clouds unbroken, keeping their crimson promise.

*Song of the Mysterious* (窈窈歌)
All seek only life’s embrace,
Yet *Feng* (風) demands but death.
Life means no fixed abode,
Death means a resting place.

No attachment to flesh, fat, or sinew,
No clinging to bone, marrow, or essence.
What need for brows, hair, or beard?
What need for tongue, teeth, or lips?

Why use feet, hands, or head?
Why eyes, nose, or ears?
Small intestines churn water,
Large intestines refine grain.
Water and grain—so vague,
Day and night, when shall they cease?

Pierce the illusion’s false design,
Distinguish clearly what is real.
Other dualities merge into unity,
Yet the Dao stands ever distinct.

This one here, that one there,
When you meet it, drink the *Qingliang* (清凉) water.
Only when *Zhengchunyang* (正純陽) is attained,
Shall you be called *Chongyangzi* (重陽子).

*Song of the Primordial* (元元歌)
Though they be father, though they be mother,
The bond of flesh—no words to utter.
Forged in time, yet now I bear their ancient weight.
I am not son, nor daughter,
Nor bound by marital ties.
All are foes, all are debts to settle,
Better to avoid entanglement than suffer.

Awakened, I comprehend,
Awakened, I am whole.
Summoning the *Qingjing* (清靜) Master from ages past,
To see the *Linglong* (玲瓏) hall of perfect clarity,
Open the true gate of uprightness.

Thus know the lineage, know the root,
Clear and awake, returning to the *Zifu* (紫府).
In vain the phoenix consorts with the *Beihai* (北海) tortoise,
The dragon’s scales mock the *Xishan* (西山) tiger.

Wield the *Lingdao* (靈刀),
Brandish the *Huifu* (慧斧),
Splitting the treasures of *Kunlun* (昆仑).
Crowns of jade, pearls without end,
Robes of endless splendor, gold-threaded and bright.

Primordial this, primordial that—
The light returns, revealing the Twenty-Five (五五不離二十五).
Hold fast to this path, cultivate thus,
Your name already inscribed in the *Changsheng* (長生) register.

*Song of Attainment* (得得歌)
Yin transforms to Yang—only this is true.
Ice pierces fire, yet only thus is it.
With fate, I’ve sought the Dao in past and present,
Without beginning, yet what could I call?

Call what? Summon immortals,
Vague and mysterious—no years to recall.
Meeting the *Liangyin* (良因) of Five *Jie* (劫) lineage,
Together we enter the *Daluo* (大羅) realm.

*Daluo* (大羅) realm—where marvels unfold,
Unleashing brilliance for but a moment’s span.
A single grain, plentiful as silk,
A perfect light, eternal in its glow.

Eternal, it becomes divine,
Here in *Qingliang* (清凉), beyond sight or sound.
Why need incense’s heavy fragrance?
Why boast of jingling ornaments?

Their chimes fade, their echoes cease,
Yet new splendor rises, more transcendent.
Naturally, a luminous pearl within,
Reflecting the moon beyond the heavens.

Moon beyond the heavens—
Riding the *Chan* (蟾) wheel’s course,
How could this clarity ever be priceless?

*Zhengyi* (正一) erases all traces of birth and death,
Upright and firm, the profound cause revealed.
Profound cause, true secret—
Never bound by anger, joy, or delight.

Empty space ascends to the clear void,
Words spoken yet none truly said.
None truly said, yet ever more luminous,
In this song, the Dao’s *Tang* (堂) manifests.

Eons unbroken, new elegance unfolds,
From now on, this name spreads wide.

*Song of the Clear and Awake* (惺惺歌)
Why cling to the Four Great (四大)?
Who then was immortal in that age?
Better to perfect the *Yazheng* (雅正) round,
Than feign unity for false cause.

Crimson reborn, the *Shuangguan* (雙關) treasure,
Pure white unfurled, the *Wuyelian* (五葉蓮) lotus.
First refine the *Jiuzhuan* (九轉),
Then nurture the *Yangtian* (養田) above.

Nurture the Three *Tian* (田),
For steadfast longevity,
The golden-maned lion roars in rhythm.
On the *Duandan* (端午) day, survey the *Xuanyin* (玄陰),
At midnight, divide the luminous day.

Ever consume without end—all things’ essence,
Seize the Three *Guang* (光) with divine art.
Externally, why display brilliance?
Internally, refine the form in myriad ways.

This is the *Yuanchu* (元初),
Now believe this truth exists.
First encounter the *Tachizi* (太赤祖),
Return to see the *Shuzhongzhu* (黍中珠).

Seven *Zhulu* (珠戶) gates open wide,
Six *Dao* (道) silver lights freely unfold.
Gazing upward at the *Baibao* (百寶) hall,
This meeting—truth revealed in person.

This truth—no mistake,
In boundless ease, the Elixir’s essence consumed.
Radiant, resplendent—how clear it is,
Awake and lucid, yet ever effortless.

Praised by the sun in emerald mist,
Before the wind, crimson clouds emerge.
At *Kunlun*’s peak, before the jade summit,
A single lotus flower—our vow.

*Song of the Dao’s Exhortation* (勸道歌)
Cultivate, and branches bloom,
Fail to cultivate, and labor is in vain.

The scriptures never exhaust their meaning,
Incense smoke burns in vain, a hollow show.
With weary heart and labored strength, anxiety grows,
Exhausting body and mind, leaving only pallor and decay.

Without wisdom, you frantically seek the fruit of flawlessness,
Unenlightened, you wander blindly across the bridge of fate.
Others’ teachings are endlessly recited,
Yet you dare not uphold your own ancestral Dao.

In stillness, evil thrives in demonic realms,
Clinging to the middle, you fall into the net of mundane existence.
Faithfully holding talismans and elixirs—how proper!
Yet you let food and clothing dictate your true needs.

You boast of emptiness and cold detachment,
Exalting grandeur and dazzling display.
Winds, flowers, snow, and moon—scenes of sorrow,
Alcohol, lust, wealth, and arrogance—roots of bondage.

The gate of affliction opens as you speak of awakening,
The path of contention unfolds as you preach liberation.
Morning and evening, coughs and throat ailments drain you,
Midday practices scatter like empty wind.

All these methods are useless—abandon them now.
From this day on, heed only these words.

Let true function arise naturally in serene stillness,
Trust in compassion to transcend all bounds.
Silent and tranquil, purity shines forth,
In the void’s embrace, darkness harmonizes.

Dragons and tigers must not wander the Three Realms,
Infants and maidens must not dance in vain display.
Mighty roots respond to the strike,
Lonely spirits play their bamboo flutes.

The Two Forces unite like clay molded,
The Five Desires abandoned like carved wood.
Seize the true sound echoing in emptiness,
Silence the false roars of your nature.

Two maidens cast into the gold mine,
Two boys enter the jade gourd.
Break off the wood’s tip for repeated refining,
Then open the spring’s waters for repeated rinsing.

Graceful hues defy all adornment,
Clustered forms resist all description.
Their appearance dazzles the eye,
Their radiance shines like jade and pearl.

Returned to the Dao’s hall, they earn their noble name,
Allowed only in our gate to be called *A-Jiao*.

*Obtain, obtain, obtain*—
Free to compose poetry, music, and song.

**Song of Self-Lamentation**
Ah, in my youth, my parents spared no care,
Ever thinking of filial devotion, I strove with all my might.
Yet how could I ever repay such boundless love?
Only shallow attachments accumulate in vain.

Now I refuse such weary labor,
Content in poverty and leisure, selling nothing but high truth.
Delighted in boundless ease, I nap at noon in blissful repose.
The foolish do not grasp my family’s intent,
Night and day, they scheme in vain.

Four clinging obsessions consume them—
Alcohol, lust, wealth, and arrogance.
Better to let the *Harmful Wind* strike them down,
Free from worry, far from sorrow.

Clouds and waters, green mountains await my joyous roaming,
I wish to return to the Three Isles, the Ten Directions.

Escape the mundane cage,
Enter the jade cavern—
Cease this false body’s empty play.
Then monkeys and horses will all return to nothing,
And only the bright moon remains in use.

**Secret Song of the Dao**
*Sword-Stalactite, Sword-Stalactite*—how fine!
How few can pierce the veil of delusion.
Even if you claim enlightenment, where shall you go?
How shall you bind yourself, how carry yourself?

This *Sword-Stalactite*—
It can drink, too,
Washing away the tenfold brocade within.
Ten thousand petals, a thousand flowers, ever renewed,
Five directions’ hues, each with its own rank.

The *White-Transcending Sword-Stalactite*—
Round and bright,
Emitting its own luminous light.
Dazzling yet unmatched,
Even surpassing the Purple-Gold Elixir.

This *Sword-Stalactite*—
Its blade is sharp,
Unbroken through countless kalpas.
The wise see its radiant wisdom,
The foolish grow only more confused.

This *Sword-Stalactite*—
Truly steel,
Floating in space, it emits its own light.
Only the *Harmful Wind* dares to touch it,
And even then, its essence remains pristine and cool.

This *Sword-Stalactite*—
Ancient and boundless,
Neither yin nor yang, neither earth nor dust.
Just a *lixiangluo*—
From *lixiangluo* comes the lineage’s origin.

**Song of Stability**
Cultivate, and branches bloom anew,
Yet do not chase the light winds—trust in stillness.
Ever bathed in dew and rain, it thrives in emerald green,
Soft and yielding, it fears no frost nor snow’s decay.
Thus does vitality flourish, qi harmonized.
Do not rely on scattered pills for virtue’s path,
Nor cling to talismans for transcendence’s hope.

Ancestral teachings must be penetrated,
Your own Dao must be firmly upheld.
External scenes must not intrude, external affairs must cease,
Search within for the incense of true essence.

Graceful maidens cast into the gold mine,
Handsome youths enter the jade gourd.
One plants a treasure tree in the ore,
The other nurtures the fungus in the vessel.
Their union yields three rare virtues,
Their meeting dances the Six *Mei*.

Ten slender fingers strike the drum,
Seven gates open to blow the flute.
Through raging flames they advance,
On surging waves they float.

The path of true awakening cleanses all filth,
The road of perfect fulfillment shines beyond dust.
Crimson clouds enfold the celestial blue,
Emerald mists spiral in the azure void.

Mysterious and profound, unobstructed,
Awake and lucid, forever unbound.

**Song of Boundless Ease**
*Simplified sounds, swift sounds*—
Abandon wife, forsake child, sever all ties.
Past affections—no need to lament,
The *Harmful Wind* obscures no light.
Ghostly messengers of *Dian* have turned back,
Your name erased from the Black Register’s rolls.

Speak with your mouth, act with your heart,
The path to Penglai is secure—eternal life awaits.

**Song of Profound Profoundness**
*Wūzhuō Peak* stands with its ten-thousand-foot staff,
At its tip, a child plays in joyous abandon.
Wrapped in clear winds, he leaps in wild delight,
Before the bright moon, he boasts of his skill.

Again and again, he plucks the *màtuó* elixir,
Frequently tossing the coral cauldron.
The elixir and cauldron slip—
Effort wasted in vain.

Parting the silver waves, he gazes at the jade shore,
And there he sees the golden tortoise in the jade vessel.
Qi glows like amber, eyes shine like pearls.
The child descends the staff to claim the pearl in vow,
Not letting the *Lí Dragon* hide it below,
Nor casting it into the clouds—he hurls it to the Azure Void.

Obscure and distant, time forgotten,
From this moment, he knows the effortless way.

**Song of the Reached**
Cultivate with wisdom, devise grand strategies,
Search and arrange with broad intent.
The Eight-Eight Maiden steadies her hands,
The Six-Li Gentleman applies his effort.

**Song of the Alchemical Arts**

Fair and ruddy, he knows the gold mine’s secret,
Black and lithe, he seeks the jade vessel’s treasure.
He drinks and pours himself—awake, then drunk,
To song and dance he yields, his mirth unshaken.
He smashes open the *Yáng Path* to spread the sacred gem,
Through the *Yīn Pass* he emerges, the *lùliú* wheel in hand.
Ascending *Kūn Mountain*, he presents a slice of jade,
Returning to the great sea, he plays with pearls so bright.
With every touch, he grasps the Dao’s profound essence,
Wherever he wanders, he finds paths smooth and clear.
His head brims with *Lí Dragon*’s hidden wonders,
His feet overflow with *Yáo Flower*—seizing emptiness with ease.
He teaches his face to move with boundless grace,
Nurturing his roots through breath, the art of *xīhū*.
At *Zhōu Chéng*’s dawn, the true awakening comes,
The *Dìduān*’s end reveals the great *Dà Chéngsū*.
Alone, he shines—no difference in his radiance,
Five paths’ light unified, none can surpass his splendor.
Like the *Huánghuā* poet’s single gain,
Or *Qiáo*’s red crow transforming into twin ducks.
The *Sān Dǎo* islands call him to their pure retreat,
The *Shí Zhōu* lands unite beneath his guiding step.
In stillness, he asks the clouds’ crossroads—only the *Dòngdá* knows,
Adrift and free, he joins the ranks of immortal paths.

---

**Song of the Gift to a Friend**

Who can summon the sea’s refined *qi*?
Only *Zōu Zhèngdào* in the *Nínghǎi* ranks.
Gold waves and silver tides return to their source,
To welcome *Pénglái Island*—now revealed in sight.
*Pénglái Island*, where is it found?
Obscure and distant, touching the boundless sky.
Who shares this boundless ease with me?
Only you, my friend, dwell in this cool, pure place.
This cool, pure place—truly it exists,
Where the *Qīngtóng* child presents the elixir of long life.
Let it permeate the four seasons’ spring,
A single pearl’s light roars like thunder.
Its light roars like thunder—crimson clouds it spews,
Blanketing the clear sky with marvelous splendor.
Descending the spirit waves, it stirs not a ripple,
Soaring to the celestial heights, its expanse knows no end.
Its expanse knows no end—truly it is seen,
Mysteries profound, revealed in their play.
The cloud-car enters the Azure Void once more,
On *Dàluó*’s heights, his alchemy takes form.
His alchemy takes form—*yuán gēn* obtained,
The gate of *wúwéi*’s great Dao now stands revealed.
May you turn back and grasp this truth,
Ascend the path of no leakage, beyond all speech.

---

**Song of the Iron Cauldron**

*Iron Cauldron Song*, *Iron Cauldron Song*,
From its first forging, following the golden method.
Its belly hollow, yielding wonders profound,
Who knows its secrets, its subtle messages?
*Iron Cauldron* formed, *Iron Cauldron* formed,
Frequently filled with jade nectar, brimming.
When fire refines it, snow-waves scatter,
When water clears it, blessings of peace ascend.
*Iron Cauldron* carried, *Iron Cauldron* carried,
Its ringing strikes the deaf, dispelling ignorance.
If one would hear its resonant call,
North or south, east or west—all shall know.
*Iron Cauldron* new, *Iron Cauldron* new,
Its inner light and outer glow are kin.
To add to the cauldron, one must rely on *jīnyè*’s tide,
To blend and harmonize, all depends on *qi* and spirit’s might.
*Iron Cauldron* wide, *Iron Cauldron* wide,
Where *qi* surges, snow drifts in endless tide.
Only then does the *Hǔlóng* coil in still embrace,
Wrapping lead and mercury tight on its head.
*Iron Cauldron* deep, *Iron Cauldron* deep,
No dust or defilement can breach its keep.
Its use is fire that burns the wood above,
Its practice, gold refined within the water’s love.
*Iron Cauldron*’s light, *Iron Cauldron*’s light,
Three lights shine—auspicious signs take flight.
Each time it’s used, transformations arise,
When left to rest, it cools with tranquil skies.
*Iron Cauldron* burned, *Iron Cauldron* burned,
Last night, today, and the morn to come.
By seasonal rule, the furnace is set,
With time, the jade mushrooms grow.
*Iron Cauldron*’s power, *Iron Cauldron*’s power,
Within it, the *qi* swells like a stormy tower.
Obscure and distant, the wind is its friend,
Drowsy and silent, the moon its companion.

**West River Moon (Alchemical Reflections)**

Worthy of praise—this southwest land’s ease,
Burning firewood, all of it true silver.
Within the flames, two forms are seared apart,
Half of them blooming as gold flowers.
Recognizing the *jīnxīng*’s weight with precision,
At once, the merit is paid in full.
*West River Moon* wraps the spirit’s essence,
Revealing the *língtóng*’s true seal.
Worthy of praise—the water’s single flow,
Must rely on a thousand cauldron additions.
From the sea’s heart, a ten-thousand-fathom pole sways firm,
After stillness, the mushrooms sprout.
Understanding the labor, swift and sure,
One finds joy in ease, immersed in bliss.
*West River Moon* wraps the mushrooms’ tender shoots,
Carrying them to the *Shí Zhōu* and *Sān Dǎo*.
Worthy of praise—leaving home’s threshold,
Must neighbor the *Jiǎdì Gēngtú*’s sacred path.
In darkness, he claps his hands, calling in laughter,
Slowly, they blend in perfect harmony.
Locking the golden gate, the *Bái Yáng* teams form pearls,
*West River Moon* wraps the lone jade hare,
Illuminating the path of eternal life.
Worthy of praise—the clouds rise from his crown,
Soaring aloft, where wonders abound.
Mysteries profound all radiate in light,
Within the cauldron, silver waves ignite.
Ashamed to refine, he turns to gold’s face,
*Yáo Flower* blooms, dancing in grace.
*West River Moon* wraps the drink of jade nectar,
A thousand paths of crimson clouds part.
Worthy of praise—the wood and gold’s dual form,
*Jiǎfū Gēngfù* smile with joy.
Their laughter’s sweetness echoes in flowing streams,
A clear current emerges from the ravine.
Nourishing the *huángyá*’s endless growth,
They teach white snow to cycle in rebirth.
*West River Moon* wraps my climb,
Each step, the silver hare watches my path.
Worthy of praise—the day’s swift change,
Frequently wiping the spirit’s hall.
A single light dispels all dust,
Its brilliance pierces both inside and out.
Claiming adrift ease, his flute scatters cold plums,
*West River Moon* wraps the *guìhuā*’s bloom,
Its fragrance draws the clean winds to meet.
Worthy of praise—the white lotus unfurls,
Three chariots harnessed to the golden ox.
Naturally, its red splendor covers the peaks,
Not forged by labor, but by spirit’s light.
Guarded by the refined glow’s power,
The elixir’s done—its radiance lights the divine boat.
*West River Moon* wraps the sight of *Yíngzhōu*,
A single strike of the immortal song resounds.
Worthy of praise—this melody’s grace,
Moved by the *Shífù*’s stone flute’s embrace.
On mountain peaks, they speak of water’s frequent rain,
In ocean depths, they whisper of fire’s flame.
When the round brilliance shines true,
The pure wind spreads, its gusts unrivaled.
*West River Moon* wraps the eating of mushrooms’ taste,
Their flavors clear—now understood.
Worthy of praise—this single true nature,
Gained with laughter, the wise now stumble.
No incense burned, no scriptures read,
This path alone leads swift and speed.

赠王俊
*To Wáng Jùn.*

**Ode to Departing the World**

The Earthly Lung, Master Zhòngyáng,
Is called the Royal Harmonic Wind.
When it comes, the days and months extend,
When it departs, one follows the west or east.
It takes the clouds and waters as companions,
And the void and emptiness as neighbors.
The true nature of the One Spirit remains,
Not aligned with the multitude’s minds.

---

**Poem**

To Wáng Jùn:
*If you halt halfway, wait until the Royal Harmonic Wind departs, then cease.*
Admonish you not to cling to the "having within, lacking without"—
*Without the without, you lose the having within;*
*With the with, you nurture the jade-flower crown,*
*And from each crown, you gather the golden lotus head.*

---

**Poem**

The Royal Harmonic Wind repeatedly visits the Lotus Sect,
For the Three Teachings, only your Daoist discourse is shared.
At this moment, we meet in perfect harmony above and below,
In the midst, our gathering aligns with each’s own west or east.
Know that winter solstice yields the green and white,
And spring equinox reveals the crimson and verdant.
Swiftly, the Three Lights may be grasped if wisdom dawns,
Hastily, the Four Illusions dissolve into emptiness.
A single round and luminous essence suffuses all things,
Yet the myriad forms conceal it utterly.
The awakened nature naturally flows like water in stillness,
The enlightened mind enters the hundred-blooming flowers.
Each illusion shattered still returns to the marvelous,
Each return reveals the ultimate end.
Food and drink merely sate the hunger—two wondrous means,
Before you, the jade-like lingzong stands clear.

To the Daoist Assembly:
*All know that the long and the Dao are neighbors,*
*Seeking the profound and profound, you bind kinship.*
Do not forget the Three Teachings’ logic,
Nor abandon the eternal spring of Complete Perfection.
Nurture the Original Qi to ever fill,
Secure the Spirit Essence to never leak.
The Nineteenfold Radiance as my wish,
Dare I invite you to join in boundless joy?

**On the Celestial Realm:**
*Seizing its true essence, search ends in absolute clarity,*
*Each form dissolved, yet none intrude.*
The Jade Retreat’s depths are naturally serene,
White clouds drift without intent, their comings and goings.
The swelling moon enhances its splendor,
Fine breezes carry melodies of virtue.
With languid gaze, I observe Pan Yue’s prose,
With leisurely touch, I stroke Bo Ya’s zither.
Outside, the flowers and strolling crowds grow still,
Within, the herbs and elixirs gather close.
The Three Fields must return to their supreme treasure,
The One Nature ascends to lofty peaks.
Nurturing the phantom body as bright as light,
Dancing the prenatal sage like wind and song.
Vanished and silent in endless twilight,
Eternal stillness guards the water’s gold within.

**On the Question of Dreams:**
*Capturing the mind-monkey, taming the spirit-god,*
*There is no dream-distress when the true nature is held.*
The tail’s root remains motionless, preserving vital essence,
The kidney’s sea ever replenishes the silver waters of the Primordial.
Internally, this fosters heightened awareness,
Externally, it nourishes the body’s life.
Widely practicing rituals and incantations to save all,
You attain the carefree shore-dweller’s ease.
To Master Wáng:
*Seeking the Dao in practice requires no teacher,*
*Only self-knowledge within the heart.*
In purity, wisdom ever grows,
In seclusion, compassion naturally arises.
Carrying firewood, fetching water—only the sound matters,
Gazing at forms, pondering thoughts—each does as they will.
Reducing food to forget the self is noble generosity,
Embracing joy to take delight is true cultivation.
Healing others with medicine brings supreme merit,
Avoiding wine and meat is most fitting conduct.
Wait until the gate opens to reveal the Host’s nature,
Then follow the fateful thread to its end.

**On Internal Matters:**
*In cultivation’s logic, speak with careful emphasis,*
*Only the heart’s stillness and clarity suffice.*
When the eye’s vision ceases, the dragon rests within,
When the nostril’s block is lifted, the tiger lingers no more.
The tongue retreats from taste, the mind and spirit rejoice,
The ears release sound, the kidney’s waters grow clear.
North and south harmonize as one body,
East and west merge, extinguishing the Three Passions.
Wood and metal vie in the coiled abdomen’s realm,
The prenatal sage follows, moving freely at will.
The Golden Elixir forms at the crown’s apex,
Five radiant lights illuminate the Dao’s rainbow canopy.

**On Drinking and Gambling:**
*The heart drifts in idle amusement, lost in fleeting pleasures,*
*Unrestrained abandon leads to the brink of ruin.*
Do not let drinking sever filial piety,
Nor let gambling disrupt your household.
The Daoist path is best entered with reverence,
The royal law must be followed without extravagance.
Equality in action brings ease,
And you may join me in the misty peaks.

**To the Scholar on Learning:**
*Zài Yǔ’s midday slumber is unbearable to behold,*
*Wasting light and time in sleep and gluttony.*
Diligence in a humble dwelling brings no shame,
In a thatched hall, cultivation seeks no comfort.
Snow reflected through the window brings constant joy,
Head suspended in meditation finds its own delight.
Great ambition need not cling to a single treasure,
Sun Bin’s wisdom suits the study of Ní Kuān.

**To Master Xiǎo Dá:**
*Unlock the original essence, and clarity comes naturally,*
*Release the true light, and all attachments vanish.*
The Three Treasures must converge to perfect awareness,
The One Spirit fears no obstruction in its completion.
Mastering subtle applications requires purity and stillness,
Recognizing the profound depends on clarity and refinement.
Fit to be a carefree guest beyond the clouds,
Treading the path of longevity toward the fore.

**Self-Narrative:**
*Crimson agate hangs in the silent void,*
*Deep stillness and mystery before my eyes.*
With mother-of-pearl, I fortify the elixir chamber,
And with amber, I till the Field of Regeneration.
Four precious treasures securely gathered,
The Three Radiances transmitted with utmost care.
This method, once attained, transcends the empty world,
In the depths of the rainbow, I tread the Golden Lotus.

**On Life and Death:**
*Ever know contentment to roam freely,*
*Do not cling deeply to the fire’s pit.*
The nature above is clear—two paths divide,
Before noon, recognize the Host’s true form.
The One True Essence reveals its luminous structure,
The Seven Orifices breathe the auspicious Qi.
Palming compassion and mercy, you transcend the Dharma-realm,
On the path of cool clarity, you attain eternal life.*

**To a Friend Who Offers Wine:**
*Though the road ascends without my bidding,*
*The mist and clouds summon my nature to awaken.*
Ten thousand miles of clear wind as constant companion,
One wheel of bright moon as ever-present disciple.
Mountains green and waters blue, step by step they guide,
Wine white and barley yellow, turn by turn they beckon.
Tonight’s cup, if taken with intent,
Unleashes the red flame to illuminate the ice-cup’s depths.*

**To a Friend Seeking Quietude:**
*Black clouds disperse, the moon shines ever clearer,*
*Illuminating the dusty world, extinguishing all sentient longing.*
No more afflictions arise when perfect wisdom is held,
No more quarrels remain when the deep pit of duality is crossed.
Above the peaks, a subtle breeze arrives,
Within the heart, I welcome the light snow.
The recluse who faces the wall knows this flavor,
On the carefree path, they attain the round and perfect.

**On Transient Glory:**
*Not clinging to honor and splendor is a virtuous cause,*
*Distant and detached, your vision grows ever new.*

**On the Eight Consciousnesses and Five Gates:**
Eightfold perception penetrates the boundless night—
Fivefold luminosity shines upon eternal spring.
From this, one may transcend the Three Realms,
By this, one may emerge from the Six Dusts with divine grace.
A single golden lotus ascends to the highest realm,
Round and perfect, never to sink into the mire of delusion.

**To a Friend:**
The Dao is wordless, beyond hearing’s reach,
Zen’s boundless openness unites all beings.
Which seated practice can awaken one?
Who discerns the incense’s smoke as it divides?
Seizing the true essence of the Three Lights,
The Four Great Elements dissolve in their tumult.
A radiant cluster shines beyond the void,
Only then does one drift free like white clouds.

**A Friend’s Inquiry:**
Nature’s rhythms unfold in tranquil ease,
No need for elixirs, no need for immortals.
A single breath nurtures the spirit ever purer,
A thousand gold pieces cannot buy the bliss of high slumber.
Crimson flames pierce the three peaks,
White lotuses bloom fresh with five petals.
Piercing through the labor of practice’s path,
Here, one may recognize the profoundest mystery.

**On the Eye:**
Like sunlight, clear as crystal,
Illuminating all, ever vigilant.
Gazing only at the empty spectacle of dust,
Would you read the *Huangting* scriptures within or without?
The pupil steadied cannot see the Dao,
A child sits upright, yet does not perceive form.
If a teacher meets you with a golden needle,
He will scrape away the dust—your wisdom eye will shine bright.

**Self-Realization:**
Teeth fallen, hair gray, my aged frame remains,
Yet the original spirit clings to foolishness still.
In the market’s hustle, I earn my daily bread,
On the mountain’s heights, I bear the moon’s solitude alone.
Dispelling the waters, the fire’s essence is revealed,
Parting the smoke, I point to the ice-cup’s lake.
From this moment, my crimson clouds unfurl,
Treading upon pure yin, this wheel of darkness is shattered.

**On the Sword:**
Awakened, the treasure-sword is clearest of all,
Sharpened and polished, it stands mute before me.
Lifted high, it splits the new Dao’s eye,
A single stroke severs the old entanglements of the heart.
Dawn reveals its pristine, unstained brilliance,
Night emits its radiance with resounding clarity.
It repels demonic forces and malevolent qi,
All dissolve into formlessness beyond the void.

**Composed at Comrade Zheng’s Residence:**
Today, on this clear and bright water hall,
A dwelling place where all may dwell in perfect ease.
Children, grandchildren, wives—all rejoice in harmony,
Their virtue as fragrant as the lotus on the Dao’s path.
Retreating from self to serve others is Comrade Zheng’s way,
Resting the mind in goodness surpasses scriptural study.
When fortune arrives, we dwell beyond green mountains,
A thousand *li* of white clouds as our painted screen.
Last night, I dreamed the Eight Immortals called,
They bestowed robes of *luan* and jade embroidery.
Spread out scrolls of barbarian silk, richly embroidered,
A single elephant-tusk flute wafts clouds and mist.
I widely impart teachings to open the heart’s ground,
Writing verses and poems to sow fields of merit.
Who can fathom the secrets of celestial mechanism?
Only the *Harmful Wind* can transmit its essence alone.

**Hearing the Oriole’s Song:**
Today, the twenty-eighth of the third month,
A sudden oriole’s cry pierces my ear.
I open the Dao’s eye to behold it—
Its feathers newly brushed with gold.
It turns and sings its pure, clear notes,
Its intent, I think, aligns with my own heart.
Like a *qin* just tuned to its finest pitch,
Even the wind and moon, without sentiment, are its audience.

**Early Spring:**
The world’s net unravels—no dust to stain,
The garden blooms like a spring within a cave.
Do you still recognize the carefree traveler?
Do I not dwell in effortless ease?
Verses flow as I sit, one after another,
Drunk, I raise the wine cup again and again.
The four seasons’ flowers bloom in their own splendor,
Yet only this pure fragrance remains equal.
The mundane cage is left far behind,
Who today knows the spring beyond the world?
If one clings to the embroidered sash,
They have already become a carefree recluse.
Poetry spreads through the brush’s swift strokes,
Wine glides through the fragrant cup, ever anew.
Recognize the ancestors’ true ground,
Golden sprouts nourished throughout the garden’s expanse.

**Inscribed on a Friend’s Tower:**
Deeply I envy the child’s joy in driving the ox,
No need for adornment, no rush to comb the hair.
Leisure is the true kin of incense’s sacred flame,
Labor’s toil knows not the distant, boundless ease.
Though the *Penglai* Isles lie but a step away,
The carefree path to the Purple Palace I’ve already trod.
Letting go of the River of Love brings utmost purity,
The light carriage glides across the Ten Realms.
**To a Friend on the Snow:**
Scarlet clouds thicken, the white sand chills—
Dancing in the void, they blind the eye’s reach.
Auspicious omens fill the measure of a foot,
The six-petaled flower blooms as prophecy.
Beyond the scene, the painted image returns to the fisherman,
Within the radiance, purity belongs to the immortals.
As evening falls, the moon clears the dense mist,
A single stream of light illuminates the white clouds.

**To My Nephew:**
A new poem for my seventh brother,
My words are earnest—do not waste your days.
Uphold the nation’s laws, ponder righteousness,
Guard the military gates, protect the armor and spear.
In shared meals, let courtesy prevail,
In speech and song, let humility lead.
Prioritizing others is the wisest path,
Soon you shall return, singing triumphant songs.

**On My Elder Brother’s Birthday:**
Auspicious clouds and mists give birth to the virtuous,
At five hundred years, the third month’s encounter is most wondrous.
The eleventh day’s hour is uniquely rare,
Three thousand years have passed since the peach blossoms first bore fruit.
Do not refuse the golden *xueliang* wine—add more,
Let the jade censer’s incense burn full and bright.
I raise my cup in toast—none can compare,
Today, as your younger brother, I speak with care.
If compared to gold and jade, they may be lacking,
If compared to rivers and seas, they are not exhausted.
If compared to iron and stone, they may be shattered,
If compared to pines and cypresses, they may be bent.
Yet my brother’s longevity surpasses all—
Endless, unbroken, never to fade.
Midday has passed the radiant sun’s peak,
Tender green and delicate red mark the forbidden smoke.
The true fire of purity is now revealed,
Not lost in the murky wine—his Dao is firm.
Knowing his singular nature brings eternal life,
Why shame the mortal frame with its old rags?
The swallow’s murmurs are all enchanting,
The oriole’s trills gaze upon the virtuous child.
Who among the Three Fields recognizes the treasure within emptiness?
The Four Deceptions I alone perceive on the mountain’s heights.
If one reverses the Five Phases’ order,
Even today, one may meet the immortals.

**Reflections:**
Leisurely, leisurely, I take up the brush,
Revealing the Four Worthies within the study hall.
The inkstone boy adds water with a child’s delight,
The red-robed maiden grinds the ink with ancient skill.
The silver-haired youth transmits the script,
The green-browed maiden spreads the brocade paper.
Ninefold transformations arrange the true jade’s glow,
A single stroke completes the pearl’s perfection.
Bright light gathers in a thousand gleaming forms,
Vibrant hues cluster in five resplendent colors.

The **Celestial Master’s** lofty ascent—
Tenfold worthy to offer the Great Dao’s saints.
The Wind King’s harm retreats to distant peaks,
Trusting feet like clouds near the Ocean’s bounds.

Eight hundred deeds bear twin trees’ fruit,
Three thousand merits thunder in one voice.
No lust for steeds nor worldly cravings rise,
Nor monkey-minds to plunder mortal wealth.
Wealth and desire both may vanish clean,
Yet wealth and desire need not cling to me.
Forever banished from the Yellow Springs’ fall,
Long since turned back—now the Dao’s eye opens wide.
Wherever the Azure Mists gleam bright,
I follow wind and moon past the Jade Terrace.

---
**To Li Dao Friend**
Your leisure knows no bound, your joy unbound—
The Dao is whole, the world’s dust cast aside.
Your verses shine like banished immortals’ words,
Your spirit echoes Laozi’s ancient home.
Yet know the literary heights of Han Yu,
And the lute hall’s bond with Bo Ya’s tune.
Does Rong Qiao still walk this earth?
Let us return to Penglai, striding on clouds.

---
**Continuing the Rhyme**
From cloud-roots rise, unbound by mortal span,
Everywhere the wind and moon’s bright play.
Two cranes cross the water—mine to ride,
The Qichuan scene now mine to claim.
Clear and empty qi, by Master’s guidance,
Serene and pure—yet I fall short of Yi Ya’s grace.
Adrift in ease, I grasp true freedom’s art—
Why seek elixirs or feast on morning mist?

---
**On the Red-Eyed [Saint]**
What sound within your ears now sharpens clear?
Yet eyes like blindness, crimson and unseeing.
Like monks at first stillness, deep in dhyana’s hold,
Or the Dao’s first steps—now the work begins.
Inner thoughts dissolve, the spirit dwells serene,
No outward musings—emptiness is all.
The wild horse tamed, the mind’s monkey bound,
The Jade Path at the crown now opens wide.

---
**On the Charcoal Grinder**
The donkey’s strength too weak for the steep path’s climb,
The driver’s wrath stirs—his blows rain down.
One heart’s fury at the pace too slow,
Two hands wield the whip in ceaseless pain.
Yet why not know what’s light and what’s heavy?
More suffering comes from this blind strife.
Oh, how cruel—no mercy in his sight!
This alone proves karma’s bitter fruit.

---
**Master Shuo’an’s Transformation of Ma Yu**
A monk of nameless rank guards stillness here,
His verse proclaims:
*"Opening and closing—what cause lies deep?
Silent sitting banishes greed and wrath.*
The tower’s horn like spring’s fleeting dream,
The waves of Release now reveal true form.
When clarity dawns, the heart is clear—
When faintest ripples stir, the water’s pure.
To watch the world’s folly, bound in ignorance,
Thus I stay in the Zen hall, never leave.
The Master answers each line with three—
Eight quatrains follow, marking the Eight Consciousnesses.

*Opening and closing—what cause lies deep?
All from the eye’s realm, dust’s net undone.
White steeds pass by, too swift to stain,
Wild horses gallop free, unchecked, unbound.
Silent sitting banishes greed and wrath—
No ear for worldly clamor, no embrace.
No drum nor string, yet music lingers near,
No chord, yet harmony fills the air.
The tower’s horn like spring’s fleeting dream,
Breath alone suffices—no need for speech.
This parting bears clear fruit’s promise bright,
This life plants seeds of virtue’s worth.
The waves of Release now reveal true form—
Tongue’s five tastes never touch the lip.
Three times serene, in purity alone,
One flavor sweet—beyond all price.
When clarity dawns, the heart is clear—
A single light within the body glows.
From now, stillness and dimness intertwine,
Yet deeper shadows veil the way.
When faintest ripples stir, the water’s pure—
Desire and thought dissolve, the heart undone.
Leakless, effortless—true awakening’s rise,
Neither gain nor loss seals perfection’s close.
To watch the world’s folly, bound in ignorance,
Delusion clings—life and death ensnare.
Now light returns, the mirror’s gaze,
The heart’s true nature grasped in Dao’s embrace.
Thus I stay in the Zen hall, never leave,
No defilement clouds the mind’s pure light.
Unfulfilled still is my vow to save all beings,
Yet Dao’s deep talk I’ll now unfold.

---
**To the Monk Named Nameless**
The Master now has coolness, pure and bright,
One nature shines with fortune’s golden light.
Yet ‘Nameless’ suits him best—where does the Buddha dwell?
Where is the Sage who first set foot on earth?

---
**A Friend’s Inquiry**
Spring’s youth is best for study’s embrace,
Truth’s logic clear—no need for forced chase.
If exams call, then win with might,
Yet honor’s mark already gleams in sight.
Yan the Scholar pens four lines—twelve more follow:

*"How does the wheel of birth and death unfold?
Recognize the primal face, unchanging, old.
Three treasures, five colors gathered near,
The path to longevity gleams with misty light.
To love or crave—what law can sever ties?
True purity lies in steadfast will.
All things, all forms—no grasp, no cling,
One round light on jade pools’ surface shine.
Time’s fleeting as the wind—how long has passed?
Yet none but fools mistake the way.
In leisure, seek the truth’s true face,
Then joy in freedom, unbound, embrace.
Though years may age this worn-out frame,
The True Person within knows no decay.
Do not cling to outward guise or show,
The child’s pure face reveals no shift or sway."*

---
**To the Fisherman**
This fish now dances, wild and free,
Scaled in gold, it leaps the spring’s clear stream.
Three casts with golden hook—it swallows bait,
One tug brings saints to feast at table’s edge.

---
**To the Novice in Practice**
White robes, green sash—fated ties from old,
By chance you met me, crossed the mist’s deep flood.
Though Dao’s depths still veil your path,
You’re now a little wayfarer of Penglai’s hall.

---
**To a Practicing Friend**
Leap past Yin-Yang’s forge of fate’s design,
One heart for the Dao—turn not back again.
Purity itself is the path to saints,
Only in stillness nurture inner light.

---
**On the Paper Flag**
If wind’s favor brings good fortune’s hand,
Each dawn I win the sun’s high rest.
Hungry, I beg the streets for coins to spend—
Yet only those who give are truly blessed.

---
**Echoing a Dao Friend’s Verse**
Seize the true form—no need to ask your years,
Five thousand words of incense fill the air.
Lofty ease, like swallows in repose,
I laugh at spirits bright in jade halls’ glow.

---
**To Liu the Fourth Friend**
Ever distinguish the mirror’s face,
Lest dust obscures the pearl’s bright grace.
With fate’s new thread, your form takes shape,
Yet formless body sheds the old.
In dreams you met me, speechless, deep in sleep,
Yet know I came to seek the Wind King’s keep.
Still you crave talk—let’s meet in ice’s chill,
Where warmth and cold in stillness dwell.

**On Fate’s Shallow Fortune and Laborious Days**
Fate bestows but little fortune, scarce the causes arise,
Only the toils of life’s path drag me through the years.
If you wish to dwell in ease and leisure,
Let your heart remain ever clean—no cares, no restless strife.

Leave but a few words for my ears to hear,
Wait till your life holds nothing left to do.
Then we may together roam in carefree bliss,
Meeting immortals in talk of the Unutterable.

A single finger points the way to Eternal Life,
Yet your nature’s fate still binds you tight.
From the first breath, the truth is clear to see,
Why fear the future when you’ve already touched the Way?

Reflect now on my words—if fate denies,
In you alone, let steadfast resolve arise.
With honest heart and simple truth untarnished,
Though no god nor sage, you’ll walk the path of Virtue.

To ponder chance encounters, fleeting yet fortunate,
How could such leisure ever truly be?
Man finds no joy in burdens—only ease,
Then let us rise together, hearts aligned in grace.

Better than not seeing your face at all,
Is your virtue everlasting, pure and bright.
Auspicious signs cling close, like pearls untold,
One clear gem shines—your mind’s true light.

To meet my teacher in dreams is but a sleeping sage,
Yet through you, I’ve known this fateful thread.
If you still walk this path as I’ve described,
No need for fear—just rest in boundless ease.

**The Blossom of the Third Month**
At this fair time, the third month’s flower blooms,
Like sandalwood in heart, like jade in cheek.
Pluck one branch to crown my head and wear,
And follow me to Penglai’s halls of air.

**On the Paper Skull to Warn Ma Yi**
Ah, lament the world where all are bound in sorrow’s net!
I must now paint a skull to wake the foolish man.
In life, he clings to wrongs and bitter deeds,
Till he meets this fate—then he’ll cease his strife.

To be a man, one must perceive the dust of toil,
A pure mind is treasure none can spoil.
Snatch the pearl from the Lipu Dragon’s maw,
And enter Kunlun’s caves to live in flawless law.

**Ode to the Moon**
The waxing moon is gold, the waning silver bright,
Each half a measure, gold and silver in the night.
I’ve bound them both to sixteen *liang*—
How then do stars divide their weight?

**Ode to the Dwarf Sophora**
The Boundless Sage planted dwarf sophora here,
Its cool shade spreads wide—who else might share?
Today, I rejoice beneath its branches green,
Remembering well when first I planted them.

**Visiting the White Deer Hermitage**
This hermitage is named for chill and purity’s call,
Where white deer once ascended to the Heavens’ hall.
Do not mock me for coming here, my friend,
For I’ve already found my rest in clouds beyond.

**On the Sudden Change in Weather**
The Ho family’s words run deep and wide,
Yesterday’s sun, today’s gloom and pride.
If Heaven’s will could be counted by man’s hand,
It would be neither high nor broad—just like a mortal’s mind.

When neither cold nor heat the wind does blow,
Round golden cakes reflect the light on my robe.
The Martial Constellation now guards the Literary,
At the Upper Elemental Festival, brighter than its contrary.

**On a Friend’s Pond**
Naosun’s pond mirrors Han’s ancient marshes,
Before its waves, all sound is hushed and stilled.
Yet turn your gaze to where the water murmurs,
And see the wheel of life’s unjust, unending wheel.

**Hearing Cicadas in the Sixth Month**
The cicada sheds its black robe, feels its body light,
And becomes a golden one, perched high to sing its might.
It’s found true companionship in breezes clear,
Who else today would hear this voice so new and rare?

The black cicada’s shell now cast aside,
Its body rises, lighter by the tide.
In tall sophora’s shade, it sits with grace,
And sings in freedom, soft yet full of place.

**Ode to the Mid-Autumn Moon**
Strange how the sky now presses cold on man,
Yet rises up a golden plate from mist’s remains.
Not like the usual three-five nights of old,
I urge you now—do not dismiss this sight, so bold.

**On the Tea Whisk**
Light and slender, yet its purpose burns so near,
Long immersed in oil, its truth grows dim and drear.
Though I love to stir the tea’s bright glow,
How could I know the flame would turn and sear my soul?

**Ode to Bamboo**
When moonlight shines, its nodes are gold like scattered flakes,
When breezes touch, its leaves are jade—so crisp, so frail.
Through winter’s chill, it stands with virtue’s mark,
Not like the common grass that bows and falls apart.

**Ode to Tea**
Once I saw it at Zhao’s old abode,
Now Lu Quan serves it in seven cups of joy.
After brewing, where does it go?
The wind carries me to Penglai’s shore.

**Giving a Fan to My Nephew to Ward Off Dust**
You wash away wine and wool with care,
I give this frost-laden fan to little Seventh Brother.
To clear the dust and open the eyes of the Dao,
And grant my child forevermore this breeze of Virtue.

**On the Fifteenth Night Moon**
As twilight fades and clouds withdraw,
The moon’s cold wheel still shines where night withdraws.
This light tonight is clear and bright—distinct,
Do not compare it to the common sight.

**On the Tea House**
I’ve feasted on coiled peaches, better than mere fruit,
This flavor’s taste belongs to me—my suit.
To trade the false for truth, my nature’s call,
Point the way to Penglai, where rainbows span the hall.

**Lamenting the World**
Ah, lament the world where name and gain are sought,
Morning’s greed and evening’s love—no end in sight.
To see it clearly is like watching chess,
When lost, the pieces scatter, and the game is done, no less.

Hurry, hurry now, to cultivate and rise,
I’ll paint this skull to mark the path you’ll choose.
From ancient times, men chase what’s vain and bright,
Till now, they’ve not yet learned to cease their fight.

**When My Eastward Journey Was Delayed by a Friend’s Deception**
Who held my feet? I’ll slowly gather them,
Yet now I see—no need for such a scheme.
Today I’ve found the road ahead,
And now my carefree vessel sails to shore with speed.

Your feet you’ll hold, but I’ll detect your truth,
The True Wind’s path will search you out.
You know full well the ties that bind,
To cultivate and follow the land’s true law you’ll find.

**Leisurely Thoughts**
One wheel of moon, one breath of wind,
Within and without, they dance and blend.
Rolling from Kunlun’s peak so high,
Their light and breeze are clear—nature’s majesty.

**Gazing in the Mirror**
Who knows that in the mirror’s strange embrace,
I’ve split the south and north in two with grace?
I lift my spirit-mind to view its light,
No need to seek another’s face so bright.

**Self-Composed Verse**
From this, I’ll tear apart the net of iron true,
Today I leap from dust’s confining cage anew.
Now take the moon and play it with my hands,
And scatter idle clouds to seek the Wind King’s lands.

**On a Caged Parrot**
Painted as a parrot, yet it does not chirp,
Freed from its cage, it leaves life’s grip.
Tell the butterfly not to mock its flight,
For now it soars beyond this narrow sight.

**On Parting from Kin**
With heart and mind pure, no need for hair’s deceit,
The water-clouds are my path, my fate.
No need for mourners when my body’s gone,
But take this chance—now leave the bonds of life’s old sun.

**On the First Day of the Fifth Month**
I honor those who gather in the White Lotus Society,
Where guests and moon unite—this chance is rare and free.
If all would wake to eat the food of Ling Mountain’s height,
They’d trade their lives for immortality in silent night.

**On the Fifteenth Day of the Fifth Month**
May the household first know peace and auspicious fortune,
Then kindle the fire within your heart.
Burn away to see the original true face,
Gazing with joy upon the reunion’s embrace.

**On the Jade Flower Golden Lotus Society**
I urge you not to cling to *having* within *not-having*,
Nor lose *not-having* by grasping *having* within *not-having*.
*Nurture having* to bloom the Jade Flower head,
And *each head* will bear the Golden Lotus crown.

**To the Fishing Hermit**
After casting your line, you see the tortoise again,
Knowing your fate lies among the ranks of immortals.
The *wūláng* calls out—it knows my intent—
Leaping from the surging waves a thousand feet high.

**To Cui the Thousand-Household Officer Seeking Wisdom**
Refined essence seeks clarity,
Within, pure nature’s virtue stands firm.
Naturally, wisdom unfolds,
Surely revealing brilliance’s birth.
To teach you shared sorrow’s weight,
May years extend like Pengzu’s span.
Uniting the Three Teachings’ truths,
Far off, the path’s true measure is gained.

**For Hao Shenghua After Smashing the Jar**
Shattering the true ash jar,
Now the Wind King’s sight is revealed.
True remnants await awakening—
Each soul calls out to the one.
To keep the heart unshaken,
Break each illusion clean.
At *zi-wu-ma-you* hours,
Observe the skull’s hollow stare.

**Leisurely Verse**
Laughing at this wild Dao,
Why now delight in borrowed light?
Follow fate to dissolve old karma,
No longer crafting fresh misfortune.
Tame the mind-horse with firm reins,
Restrain the heart-monkey tight.
Cultivate the Way with urgency,
Each day drawing fragrant virtue’s breath.

**On Skulls**
This is King Zhao’s hollow frame,
In life, his nature was weak.
Strip away your skull’s disguise—
Now the Mid-Autumn moon shines clear.

**On Coolness**
Coolness—what does it resemble?
Not the same as bitter cold’s harshness.
Midnight moon over still waters,
Early autumn breeze after rain.

**To Fan Caifu**
My nephew, called Fifth Brother Wang,
His wife, they call my niece.
The two have forged a blessed bond—
May neither suffer ruin’s pain.
If you seek the *mercury-lead* path,
Nurture the True Dragon and Tiger.
The True Dragon and Tiger—
Most do not recognize—
One each beside Red Phoenix Peak.
Guarding their nests, they intertwine,
Exchanging east and west in trade.
This trade, when rightly done,
Slays the Three Pengs in the Dan Field.
None grasp the double meaning’s depth,
Yet a spirit boy strikes the fifth watch.
Striking the fifth watch, news spreads—
A pure spring’s perfect accord.
Like ambrosia poured upon the crown,
Only I know its true essence.
Know it well—rest, rest, rest,
Niece, nephew, hasten your practice.
If you refuse my words,
In the wilderness, two skulls you’ll be.

**Proclamation for the Golden Lotus Society**
By the eternal light of wisdom’s lamp,
We rely on the Jade Bud’s radiance.
The nature-torch burns eternally,
Unveiling the Golden Lotus’s glow.
Bathing in the Three Lights’ brilliance,
Dissolving the Four False names.
Treading the void, probing the profound,
Searching for marvels rare.
Washed clean in purity’s realm,
Moving through fragrant paths.
Each holds pearls and jade,
Together presenting crystal and gem.
Displaying the vital essence,
Nurture the qi with care.
Slightly mastering this key,
Hang the fragrant title high.

**Proclamation for the Jade Flower Society**
The transformation of jade is the essence of *qi*,
The Golden Lotus is the ancestor of spirit.
When *qi* and spirit intertwine,
They become immortals.
*The Yinshu Jing* annotates:
*"Spirit is the child of qi, qi the mother of spirit.
When mother and child unite,
Immortal birth is achieved."*

Establishing the Jade Flower Golden Lotus Society
In these two prefectures,
All must recognize true nature.
Unaware of the true source,
Many study minor side paths—
Merely methods to foster blessings and life,
Not the Dao’s true cultivation.
In matters of life and nature,
Even slight error veers from humanity.

If you seek true practice,
When hungry, eat;
When tired, sleep—
No need to sit in meditation,
No need to study the Way.
Only screen out worldly entanglements,
Only seek the two characters: *heart-clear*.
The rest is not cultivation.

Each holds wisdom—
Daily in the hall of abstinence,
Reflect deeply,
Lest you stray to other doors.

True function has its own true function and true practice.
The True Person of Jin said:
*"To achieve true function,
One must purify the heart, settle the mind,
Calm the spirit and emotions,
Neither moving nor acting,
Truly clear and pure,
Embrace the Original, preserve the One,
Nurture the spirit, stabilize the qi—
This is true function.*

*To achieve true practice,
One must cultivate virtue and power,
Relieve poverty and ease suffering,
Seeing others in distress,
Always harboring a heart of rescue,
Or transform and guide the virtuous
To enter the Way and practice.
In all actions,
Prioritize others over self,
Unselfish toward all beings—
This is true practice."*

May all honorably heed these words.
The *Complete Authentic Collection of Chongyang* ends here, Volume Ten.

**Song: *Zhuiyan Xiang* (醴醾香)**
At ease with fate’s unfolding,
Trusting steps without thought or reckoning.
A crisp breeze calls the moon as companion,
Together, boundless and free.

Along the long road, joyful and singing,
Lips hum, tongues pluck the air’s melody.
Suddenly passing through the immortal’s halls,
Mountain peaks—worth lingering to admire.

Just as blessings multiply and gather,
Strange fruits and flowers scatter sweetness and fragrance.
Though fine weather and beauty may tempt,
Let water and clouds guide my path—
To the farthest shores, the distant horizon.

Then I meet the pure spirit-vessel,
Ferrying me beyond this shore.
This time, I’ve become a true Daoist wind-han.
*Hechuang Tian* (鹤冲天)

Delusions vanish, the path is clear—
Now I may truly cultivate and refine.
Stillness is the root, the true gateway.
Do not seek elsewhere, lest you stray from the Dao’s path,
And miss the way to the immortals.

In leisure’s deepest quiet,
The primal root and luminous essence unfold,
Layer by layer, ever more awakened.
When virtue and practice are complete,
Only crimson clouds remain.

Once, I met my master in person,
Who taught me the secret of eternal life,
Again and again, with tender care.
Now I know I’ve been saved.

I vow to follow, hand in hand,
Through endless clouds, forevermore.

---
**Song: *Wang Yuanxing* (望远行)**
Under the sun’s bright gaze,
The moon pours silver, stars gleam clear.
Where the Three Lights converge,
Five colors rise in stillness—
A silent witness to true cultivation,
Where qi and spirit gather.
Now I may tread the hidden path.

This fullness of virtue and practice is certain.
With uprightness, I must refine and polish,
Revealing the original true nature—
Every leaf luminous, every branch refined,
Pure and everlasting.

Beyond the clouds, the Green Boy holds the decree,
Passing down the Celestial Emperor’s command.
I thank the Ten Isles of Master Shizhou—
The immortals have summoned me.

---
**Song: *Yong Xue* (咏雪)**
Blessings spread like jade and pearls,
Cut by wind into delicate flakes,
Scattered across the void,
Falling like powder on eaves and tiles.
Locking gardens in silence,
Dotting paths with fleeting marks—
Truly a scene fit for brush and ink.

Even treasures of jade and pearl cannot compare
To this harvest’s bounty.
Pure and fresh, its brilliance shimmers,
Its crispness ever refreshing.

Valleys flatten, mountains blend into one,
Near and far, no boundary remains.
Just like my home—
Celestial landscapes, clear and boundless,
Glowing like Penglai’s pavilions,
Bathed in eternal light.

---
**Song: *Manting Fang* (满庭芳)**
Selecting rare seeds, planting in season,
Nurtured by wind and rain,
Branches stretch, leaves unfurl.
Only when fully grown may they be harvested—
The pond’s edges turn green with new shoots.
How others envy their freshness and purity,
Their tender, plump skins.

Let them be spun into fine threads,
Woven into dense cloth,
Pounded until soft.
Then, cut and stitched into immortal robes—
Who else could wear them but me?

When virtue and practice are complete,
Six *qian* of silk are exchanged—
Now your merit truly shines.

---
**Song: *For Master Lü’s Ritual Invitation to Friends from Jingyang***
Long have I opened my heart,
Today’s ritual brings fresh delight.
Among friends, there is pure joy.
Wind-companions and cloud-friends gather,
All ascending to refine the elixir.
Only my old Jingyang brothers remain,
Their vision clear and boundless.

I invite all masters and sages,
Wishing to ascend the immortal stage.
Together, we uphold the Dao—
No need for incense or sandalwood,
Only heart-incense burning.
The saints have come to observe.

When virtue and practice are complete,
We shall surely meet in the clouds.
Tonight’s true work brings joy—
All will ride the cranes home.

---
**Song: *For Master Zhan’s Inquiry***
With lofty spirit, heart unbound,
Let no worries or entanglements disturb you.
Cultivate the self, nurture the nature—
Find joy in what fate offers.
This is to uphold the true Dao,
Kindling eternal spirit within.
Embrace leisure’s taste,
And you shall dwell in lasting years.

Thus, you must clearly understand:
Refine suffering into elixir,
Passing it down.
Then you may wander freely, ever fresh.
Wait until the primal root shines bright—
Then virtue and practice will be complete.

Do you not see?
The path to Penglai is secure—
There, you’ll meet both immortals and humans.

---
**Song: *Gift to a Friend with Doubts***
The courtyard lies in disrepair,
Trees sway in the wind—
The walls are crumbling.
You say your wife has passed,
Father and son—what can be done?
Wang Zhe laughed and said,
*"Your fate is to find joy in solitude.
You still do not see—
In the fire-pit, seek not the red furnace.
Cut away all clinging desires,
Sever them utterly.
Walk with the moon as your neighbor—
This is my disciple’s way.
Follow the steady path to Penglai,
Transcending birth and death,
Never falling into the Three Realms.
In the depths of white clouds,
There lies another heaven."*

---
**Song: *Gift to My Nephew***
Not born with talent, yet burdened by karma—
Why strive to emulate my ways?
Reflecting on yourself,
You’ve never truly excelled.
Most painful is your shallow learning,
Students crowding, trembling in fear.
When you ask for advice,
Your heart feels like walking on thin ice.
Could you ever be a model?
If so, you’d surely die—
Yet you earn only hatred.

Another chain binds you—
Soon you’ll rise above.
Turning to the Dao, I wave farewell,
Seeking friends among clouds and mists.
The true news is this:
The Penglai path is secure—
Come, let us ascend together.

---
**Song: *Huanghe Qing* (黄河清)**
The root is deep, the source pure and sealed,
Guarded in profound stillness.
Warmth grows within,
All cold and rigidity banished.
A different elegance emerges—
Now I know I’ve risen beyond control.
Naturally, eternal life is met,
The alchemical flower ready to pluck.

From the beginning, true spirit exists—
This time, I’ve found the lead and mercury.

The moment it congeals,
A single grain of *jindan* is ready to offer.

Auspicious radiance shines forth,
Now coming and going with *luan* leading *feng*.
The Ten Isles and Three Mountains—
Divine immortals rejoice, welcoming us to feast.

Again, according to the count of **one hundred and eight**—
Nine *ju* of the Yellow River, nine transformations,
Turbid waves and great billows now pure and still.
The Nine Rivers converge,
All returning to the Right Way.

In the Nine Cauldrons, it manifests,
The Nine Palaces unfold—
Flows and currents now fixed.
Jade overflows, gold cascades—
Where the nine luminosities bloom,
The nine glories unfold their shadows.
Nine heavens of emerald green align,
Nine marshes where cranes call—
Welcoming the luminous essence.

Nine lights pierce the void,
Reflecting the sacred glow.
Nine curves—divine pearls leap,
Nine immortals arrive—
Just as they swim.

Deep and clear, now complete,
The Nine Heavens’ path to holiness is open.

---
**Song: *Hanyong Chun* (汉宫春)**
Just the time to cultivate,
Deep and secret, profound and subtle.
The pivot lies here—
With this, the gate is sealed.

Awake and clear,
Now fashioned—
Elegant and true.

From ancient times, the essence has gathered—
Thus, its radiance shines.
The Three Lights shine from the start,
Now recognized—
The original tone resounds.
Pure sound permeates, echoing through the seven orifices.
From Kunlun, a *qingtong* summons me,
To fish with golden thread for the luminous mind,
Receiving the celestial scroll and purple edict.

---
**Song: *Xia Yun Feng* (夏云峰)**
In cultivation, no need for strict *zhuozuo* at *zi-wu*.
Lead and mercury naturally congeal—
Only true *ci* is required.
The swift path of the Mysterious—
Who understands it but me, content?
Secrets unfold—
Leisurely, vast and unbounded,
Subtly shifting.

Gradually, the luminous radiance emits wonders,
Changing into clouds of glory—
Light and color follow.
Truly, it was once fitting.
In the depths of white clouds,
The true teacher of the earth’s lungs resides.
Now permitted to ascend to the *Danxia*,
Together in *wuwei*.

Guarding the *zhulin*,
No action—
Alone, reclining on high peaks.
Stone pillow, grass robe—
Gazing far.
Water peaches, mountain plums—
Eating as fate allows,
Stealing *yang* and *yin*.
Slowly shedding,
The dusty mortal form,
Threefold the heart of the zither.

The *taixian* debates depth and shallowness—
Naturally revealed,
No need for further search.
Now comprehending the Mysterious,
Stepping into the *qionglin*.
Among the jade flowers,
Henceforth nurturing the true gold.
Glowing stillness,
With clear wind and bright moon—
Forever companions.

---
**Song: *Yaotai Yue* (瑶台月)**
Leisurely scenes,
True leisure understood—
Only clarity can be entrusted.
Originally, that which must be made firm.
Congealed into a single grain of *jindan*,
Five-colored clouds spread.
Together they guard,
Together they gather.
Returning light shines,
Reflected light gazes back.
Encountered—
Perfectly complete—
The true teacher’s guidance.
This aids the pure and unadorned,
Endlessly yearning.

It must be known that it has always existed.
Following the gleaming auspicious hues,
Jewelry and ornaments adorn the steps.
The *taixian* dances,
The path of immortals.
Golden boys lead,
Jade girls instruct.
Worthy to attend the *Yaotai*,
Moonlit feast on jade mats.

---
**Song: *Shengsheng Man* (声声慢)**
Knocking at the golden gate,
Locking the jade door—
Leisurely, yet no cultivation.
Who in the dimness understands?
Playing with an infant.
Sleeping, catching monkeys and horses,
Awakening to gather *qiongzi*.
Each moment,
This practice—
A hundred days, only the heart knows.

Free and unbounded,
Only spreading—
Crimson clouds and radiance.
Enveloping the luminous mind,
Now revealing the original true *ci*.
A single grain of divine *dan* forms,
Three flames tightly entwined.
Passing the *Yaochi*,
Piercing the green celestial peak—
*Wuwei*.

---
**Song: *Zhidu Chun* (绛都春)**
Naturally enlightened,
This encounter deepens—
Cool clarity awakens.
Within the stillness, lead and mercury congeal,
All because *ren* meets *bing*.
The original face becomes a jade neck—
Reflected light brings eternal tranquility.
Swiftly returning,
The path ahead is permitted—
Long-standing firmness.

Fine scenes,
Light spreads resplendent—
Beyond the void, ten thousand silver clouds align.
Gradually approaching,
Meeting and welcoming in an instant—
The *Penglai* path opens to the immortal realm.
A golden boy invites.
Holding the jade edict, taught in person,
The wind of harm received.

---
**Song: *Erlang Shen* (二郎神)**
Gazing at the dusty world,
All reduced to—
Empty names, refined.
This false form, unaware—
Still chasing cleverness and clumsiness.
A hundred years of prime—how few!
By seventy, escape is difficult.
Within, true guilt grows heavier,
No way to dispel it.
As if recalling—
Originally, one luminous point.
Swiftly recognize what it has always been called—
It is the perfected light and shadow.
Again, the *jindan* gleams—
Let it be the master,
Endlessly enduring.
May all mortals turn back,
Refining purity, not deceiving.

---
**Song: *Shang Ping Xi #1* (上平西#1)**
Toward Zhongnan,
An encounter—
Wild winds arise.
Now wandering the seas of auspiciousness.
Leisurely and content,
Free to compose poems and songs.
Naturally, the divine *qi* intertwines,
Recognizing the true incense of the heart.
True stillness—
Only clarity,
Still clearer—
Abiding in coolness.
Red, blue, black, white, and yellow.
Five colors now encircle the jewel-light.
This time, it must be permitted—
Above the azure void,
Brilliant without bounds.

---
**Song: *Qitian Le* (齐天乐)**
To cultivate, know the swift path—
How to arrange the furnace and kiln?
Take the *dantian* as treasure,
All phenomena in the *baobei* forest—
All gathered here,
Before the *Ruizhu Gong*,
Fully instructed.
Emerging with the luminous mind,
A single divine pearl—
Tumbling.
Bright and clear above the sky,
The Jade Emperor’s edict,
The green boy solemnly presenting the golden decree.

「This is the conjunction of merit and practice,
Both fully paired and matched—auspicious signs abound.
Endless and eternal,
Within the Great Luo Heaven,
Holding and carrying elixir herbs.

Clear and profound,
Suddenly transcending the Three Isles of Non-Doing.
Ascending the Celestial Gate—
Return, return, return to the Original Source.
The two mortal counties,
Now have no sight of me.

Enveloped by the Pure Wind and White Clouds,
Everlastingly summoned.
The King of Harmful Winds,
This time departs from me.
I urge all gentlemen,
To seek the Mysterious and Marvelous,
No more deliberation.

Look upon this false body,
Better than none at all.
Only now have I crossed the Other Shore,
I know it well.

To see again,
This time is difficult.
Drunk on Penglai’s splendor,
At sixty-three years of age,
In the fine season of the third month,
On the eleventh day of celebration.

Auspicious *qi* and blessed clouds,
Fragrant incense smoke sealing the divine radiance.
At this moment, the lofty vault,
Chooses to descend celestial messengers,
And the flowers of heaven scatter in disarray.
Ice and jade in form,
Divine beings in stature—
Who can truly know this?

I solemnly inform my wise elder brother,
Now, for the present moment,
Name and fame, honor and wealth—
Like fire within stone.
Swiftly escaping the mortal net,
Suddenly understanding the removal of self and others.
Free and unbounded,
The True One’s true joy—
Holding the void.

Feasting on the Shattered Peaches of Penglai,
The old path of Penglai,
Together we shall walk.

*Rain in the Flower* (花慢)
Gold chrysanthemum just blooming,
Silver hare gradually emerging,
New medicine’s radiant hue as its companion.
Unfolding in the fragrant void,
The Pure Moon of deep autumn.
Then, in accordance with the Central Harmony,
It must be the night of the full moon’s cycle.
Worthy of my family’s appreciation,
Just as it should be—
Inviting branches, welcoming the luminous pavilion.
Capable of savoring refined beauty,
Delicate hues spread out,
Illuminating shadows—
Both harmoniously paired.

Suddenly recalling the Luminous Spirit,
The Moon Hare’s origin.
Perfumed and rich, overflowing,
Graceful and luminous, boundless.
On the Seventh and Eighth of the Double Ninth,
Fragrance spreads through the Three Isles,
Light fills the Ten Lands.

*Turning the Celestial Dipper* (斗鹌鹑)
A single luminous mind—
The material for an immortal maiden.
Echoing through the Jade Palace,
The Golden Petals open by themselves.
For the sake of the Linglong’s purity,
Emerging from Penglai,
Descending here.

Exiled to the mortal realm,
Taking birth in a vulgar form.
Only fearing this body,
Wine and lust, wealth and gain.
Mingling once more in worldly pleasures,
This heart will turn to ashes.

Reawakening to the Original Truth,
The Wheel of Rebirth turns—
No calamity at all.
Gazing again,
Ascending once more to the Jade Terrace.

*Flower Along the Path* (满路花)
From the beginning, the Great Dao,
Meeting with principle to form one’s path.
Residing in the company of wind and moon,
Abandoning honor and wealth.
Abundant pure *qi*,
Swirling red clouds.
Five hues of true brilliance,
Piercing through the perfect roundness—
Within, the narrow yellow sprout emerges.

Three thousand and eight hundred,
Counted fully, with no discrepancy.
Along the path, adding elegance,
The Golden Flowers bloom.
Branch by branch, refined and graceful,
Petal by petal, gathering rare blossoms.
In the dim and murky beyond,
A sudden strike of clear sky—
Strange fragrance ascends to the elixir field.

*Mountain Stream* (蓦山溪)
Observing your form and bearing,
Your vigor and refinement are exceptional.
Bold and magnanimous,
Yet you would rescue my leisurely solitude.
Only knowing of name and fame,
Honor and wealth along the way,
Discussing literature,
Speaking of good fortune—
Purple robes adorned with golden sashes.

If you would come with me,
Hear my early planting of merit.
Cease chasing the waves’ flow.
Only if you return,
Abandoning infatuation and love of wine.

Slightly knowing the Mysterious and Marvelous,
Grasping the essence of unbounded freedom,
Under the moonlight,
Playing with the Pure Wind,
Together we shall walk to Penglai’s island.

All fail to comprehend,
Each day’s light and time fleeting.
The path is the cycle of rebirth,
The future’s affairs—
Dark as lacquer in the unseen.

Observing your bearing and demeanor,
Your youthful spirit is most refined,
With much purity,
Little greed,
Good deeds not lost.

Hollow emotions and delicate postures,
Just like bees gathering honey.
Day and night, busy plucking flowers,
Mixing and blending—
Who will taste the nectar?

If you awaken to this,
Turn back immediately.
The path to Penglai,
Where the colored clouds end,
Has a share for those who follow.

One luminous true nature,
Two substances contained within.
Three inches of the master’s body,
Four directions of wandering—
Each invites and requests.

The Five Emotions and Six Desires,
All Seven Orifices connected,
Eight Mountains towering,
Nine Palaces deep,
How to attain the Ten Realms?

Tenfold cultivation and refinement,
Nine transformations to reach sagehood.
Eight paths surge with ambrosial nectar,
Seven Gates open—
Caverns communicating with purity.
Six streets in five colors,
Four Symbols fully devoted,
Three Lights shining,
Two Nights following,
One luminous pearl gleaming.

Aspiring to Dao and cultivating immortality,
Why do all bear burdens?
Falsely coveting the boundless void,
All from indulging in external pleasures.
Inner treasures,
Unrecognized as Non-Doing—
Only boasting of strength,
Then boasting of ability,
Boasting until it all dissolves.

Not knowing how to begin,
How can one firmly establish the foundation?
Each merely endures hunger and cold,
Better to master the interplay of yin and yang.

White as pure jade, red as brilliant flame,
Light and color dazzlingly distinct—
One roundness, ten directions of clarity,
Only then does the true elixir appear.

You seek to master it,
Recognizing the Black and the White Hare.
Above and below must harmonize,
Left and right—
The Dragon and Tiger must intermingle.

Passing down the Great Elixir,
It must enter the Red Furnace,
Refined and transmuted,
Turning into Silver Frost,
One Golden Flower gathered.

Fragrance drifts far and wide,
Piercing through Kunlun’s peaks.
Wafting up to the Azure Void,
Forming clusters of light—
Illuminating and worthy of beholding.

Within the Jade Hall,
Consorting with the Great Luo Immortals,
Self-content and joyful,
Obtaining eternal spring,
Now on the path of unbounded freedom.

Pen, ink, and paper,
The inkstone as the matter.
The first and second hexagrams,
One missing—
Difficult to use.

In leisure, sitting quietly,
Counting on fingers and pondering carefully,
If one must write,
Not thinking of it in time,
Must use the Pure Spring’s water.

Just like the four seasons—
Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Warmth and cold, heat and chill,
Combining to form—
What year is to be considered?

Originally, it ascends,
With mysteries beyond measure.
In accordance with the True and Mysterious,
Aligning with Heaven’s mechanism,
The intercalary month completes the year.

Concentrating the spirit and meditating afar,
Only then does the snow within lead solidify.»

Nurture the yellow sprout,
So the Golden Crow may climb toward the bright moon.
The Yellow Mother’s match—
A different household’s wind,
With dragons roaring and tigers snarling—
Who could distinguish them?

Humans still cling to desire,
Acid and spice must be savored in moderation.
To taste flavors truly,
Let the Five Agents of the Pure and Empty
Rejoice in their harmony.

Guard the Original Intestine steadfastly,
Nourish the spirit to its divine essence—
When virtue is perfected,
Ascend to the Celestial Gathering,
Dwelling in the world without rest.

The mortal frame’s four illusions—
Now is the time to examine them thoroughly.
Limitation arises from cause and condition—
Why not practice earnestly and early?

Unsoiled by dusty toil,
Displaying another household’s wind,
Unentangled, unhampered—
For oneself, all vexations are removed.

Slightly enlightened, one resists not
The allure of wealth and beauty.

Cultivate the Original Spirit—
This true principle, this true essence,
Rests upon it.

On Kunlun’s peak,
A single spot of unbounded freedom—
Facing the red haze,
Achieving self-mastery,
The crane leads, bearing the mushroom of immortality.

Dissolving the red [passion],
Sighing at the floating world,
Driven by glory and wealth,
Chased by fame and gain—
All vie in deceitful schemes,
Jealousy ever growing,
Cunning multiplying in imitation.

All are greedy—
When does it ever cease?
Each boasts of daughters and sons to serve them.
More lost in wine and song,
Hoping for endless fulfillment—
Yet who knows seventy years may not be granted?

Even if a hundred years are allotted,
There is no escape.
Awaken early—
The path ahead is not as desired.
Turn back swiftly,
And only then may one escape birth and death.

Seek the Mysterious, investigate the subtle,
Search the profound and fathom the hidden.
Take naturally the dual completeness of spirit and qi,
Revealing clearly—
The Original Beginning’s true, round nature,
Thus it is:
Jade features, jade complexion, strange and wondrous.
Glowing with gemstone radiance,
Pearlescent hues emitting auspicious omens.
The Golden Elixir formed in empty space,
Dwelling in purity,
Ascending to the Great Luo’s celestial rank.

Frozen clouds congeal.
Accumulated pearls and jade—
Auspicious omens meet in kind.
Lightly cast and dancing,
The wind’s blade shears in swirling patterns.
In an instant, spread across—
Fields, rivers, and mountain streams.
Including the Yang Valley,
Lonely bridges and fords—
All are visible.

Facing this evening scene,
Worthy of painting by the riverbank.
Three or four fishermen laugh at each other,
Cloaked and hooded, their songs ringing.
Pointing to tavern flags, they gather to drink.
Wide locks of hair adorned,
Gardens and paths of the woodcutter—
Even more bewitching,
Distant flocks of egrets and herons.
Outshining the white crane,
Worthy of the white pheasant’s elegance.

After the evening mist clears,
The slanted sun glows with silvered clouds.
The gate welcomes its light,
As if a jade palace of immortals.
A natural Zhurong arrives,
Radiant and resplendent.
Piercing the void beyond,
Kunlun’s gems are arrayed.

When night is still and the clear sky gleams,
A single wheel of bright moon ascends,
Its light intermingling.

**Tail Note:**
The world is entirely deluded,
Clinging to wealth and beauty,
None escape error.

One with sincere elixir-making,
Seizing the moment of ease—
The Four Seasons ever pursue pleasure,
Ever more frequent in their folly,
Like moths drawn to flame,
Ever seeking refuge in the light.
Only then do they awaken—
How can they undo their burned bodies?

Regret comes too late—
Already scorched by suffering.
Avoiding harm now,
How can one escape future calamity?
Preserving the body intact,
How can one endure the searing?

Look within—
Bound only by fame, wealth, and glory.

**Dissolving Sorrow:**
Worthy of lament—
The world’s confusion grows ever deeper,
How can one escape its snares?
All are equal in their praise,
Gathering and dispersing in turn.
Endless scheming,
A hundredfold entanglements.
These demonic messengers
Calculate your fate in secret.
Wait until it’s too late to see.

Foolish mortals.

The reckless race—
Clever, nimble, bold,
Unchecked in arrogance.
They meet the Sage with deceit,
Ignoring the divine, playing with the numinous.
This is but the karmic thread they weave—
How can they evade it?
Even escape is futile.
See the summons—
Each adds to their torment and woe.
All judgments are sealed by the underworld’s decree.

The green-headed duck#2 sighs at life’s fleeting light,
Chasing glory with swift haste.
Let not fame and name ensnare you—
No need for ceaseless toil.
This splendor, when it appears,
Is like a candle flame—
Never lasting, never firm.
Time presses like jade wheels turning,
Gold flees like swift winds,
While sorrow clings, relentless and tight.

Behold the transient world—
Pushed along through borrowed time,
As seasons shift and years flow.
All must abandon, all must let go—
Better to plant good roots,
To bind fate with virtuous ties.

The wisdom-blade swings—
Severing fierce return,
The keen intellect strikes—
Piercing through the virtuous and the wise.
One’s own voice can refine elegance,
Old melodies resonate—
Worthy to answer this string.

Recognize the primal source,
Seek the essence ever-present,
Subtle, profound—all merge into the Mysterious.
Attaining Oneness,
Eternal spring’s radiance remains,
As it ever was.
No coming, no going—
Within Penglai’s isle,
A Daoist immortal.

Lament the Yellow Flower—
The Great Sage often comes to save.
Yet as a mortal, I speak of the lineage.
A thunderclap beneath the earth,
Shakes rain from the mountain peaks.
Who knows the iron ox plows the soil?
Kan and Li, Zi and Wu—
Seizing dragons, capturing tigers.
Such deeds—none are truly yours,
For fate’s design prevails.
Outwit the clever traps,
But the limit’s number will claim you.
See which gate you enter.

Mortals must awaken,
Mortals must see.
If they fail to wake, fail to know—
The clever traps ensnare them still.
When Yama learns of it,
He sends a sly messenger.
To the underworld’s peaks,
They rush in their going.
Midway, tears flow endlessly.
They tell the ghostly attendants,
“Pause here for now.”
A small ghost shouts,
“Do not bury your wrongs.”
Before the judge,
Speak your full account.
The master dwells in the crimson palace,
Performing daily rites,
Locking doors, sealing homes.
Inside, gold is sown—
Each coin is yours to claim.
Good fortune regards—
Awaken now.
Reach the cool retreat,
Where thought dissolves entirely.
Wondrous within wonders,
Secretly revealing the Mysterious Speech.
Coming and returning,
Going and returning—
Never again tread the Penglai path.

**Again, the Ninth Day:**
A million reds wither,
Autumn’s edge sharp and lone.
A different hue—
Central splendor, uniquely bright.
Spare the Yellow Flower,
As the Ninth aligns with Heaven’s will.
Piercing thick frost,
Unfurling golden blossoms.
Beside the fence, Yuanming rejoices,
White-clad, he arrives.
Suddenly—
A Revere-the-Aged child emerges.
Seizing the pure fragrance,
Recognizing the auspicious sign.
Three branches plucked—
A Penglai drunkenness.
This Revere-the-Aged one,
Now born in this life.
Let go of strife,
Banish sorrow—
Adrift in ease.
A single incense suffices—
No need for three prostrations.
Nor the Daoist’s hollow rites.
Laugh at the sly messengers,
Laugh at the clever ones.
Laugh at those who vie—
Officials, merchants, farmers, scholars.
Only I, serene in stillness,
Only I, unbound in leisure.
Wherever I tread—
Clouds part beneath my feet.
The flower’s heart stirs.

The eastern dawn gradually ascends,
As harmonious brilliance meets refined clarity.

Little by little, the seasons shift—
Southern lands radiant with fiery sun,
Scorching heat, dazzling light.
Gradually, the western realm gathers golden splendor,
While the northern wheel congeals in dense purity.

Gradually, enlightenment dawns,
The four seasons revealed—
How to pluck and refine them?
Gradually, the years slip by in an instant.

Gradually, the Daoist landscape emerges,
Worthy of summoning and embracing.
Gradually, qi and spirit are refined,
Transformed into elixir—
Ever more harmonized.

Gradually, the path ahead unfolds,
Clearly marked—
Clouds part beneath my tread.
No longer bound,
The Dao’s virtue/power ascends.

---
**迎春乐春日**
At dawn, auspicious qi stirs—
Spring’s warmth arrives early.
The mud ox reveals itself—
Ancient Farmer Cao’s omen.
With a graceful jade staff,
Who compares to me,
The Revere-the-Aged Daoist?

Feasting on treasures held close,
Savoring broad meals of herbs.
Already permitted to forge the elixir,
Returning to Penglai Isle.

---
**曾梅春#3**
Amid the dusty world,
All vie for beauty’s fleeting grace.
Displaying pearls and gold,
Silks and brocades—
Emotions woven in embroidery.
Children, wives, all gather together,
Music and dance in timely pursuit.
No rest—
Last night, tonight,
Endless layers of delay.
How often do they pause,
To turn back and awaken?
Only when the Dark Lord arrives,
Will their guilt truly tremble.
A thousand sorrowful expressions,
A hundred grievous thoughts—
Brows knit like blades.
Seeing the summons,
This regret now,
Cannot be concealed.

---
**凤栖梧**
By nature, I seek stillness,
Claiming the path of clouds and waters,
Endless wanderings.
Polished pearls are washed again,
Constellations rekindled—
Their hues freshly carved.
Whether seated or roaming,
In stillness, I know—
There is one who seeks me.
Often, I meet with golden dew,
Steadfast on Penglai’s path.

---
**茶瓶儿**
First, filial piety to the Golden Mother,
No power to abandon father or seek parent.
Daily offerings in baskets and trays,
Recognizing my own ancestral roots.
Call to my children—
Ride dragons and tigers,
Now is the time to serve the Divine.
Awake and reverent,
Returning to the Purple Palace,
Recording names in the Celestial Ledger.

---
**柳梢青**
Naturally refined—
Rice’s essence, wheat’s marrow.
Who can fathom
The secrets I know?
Nurturing harmony,
Enhancing wisdom,
With spirit-water’s aid.
Three luminaries’ radiance spreads,
Aiding the True Yang’s origin.
Forging the elixir,
Brightly returning to the Primordial Home.

---
**解佩令**
The Golden Lad, sleek and polished,
The Jade Maiden, slender and graceful.
Worthy of shared longevity—
Both at twenty-eight.
Where do they dwell?
One by the water, one in the northern mountains,
Entering the *Li* gate, the *Kan* door—
All are perilous.
Frequently they pull and search,
Street after street,
Every quarter reached.

**寻得灵珠**
Found the spirit pearl,
With elixir nectar and spirit-water anointed,
Radiant with myriad luminous whirls.

The Wind King’s harm—three times before,
He cut taxes in advance.
For love of wine, he drowned in drink.
Coming and going, past events forgotten,
Falling asleep in the street like a virtuous man.
Armpit cloths and headkerchiefs all abandoned.
There are scriptures with hidden precepts within.
Deep gratitude to the enlightened sage,
Who, with benevolent heart, lifts them with me—
*解佩令*—repaying the worthy’s goodwill.

At the willow pavilion, land deeds placed,
Buying floating mulberry groves.
On the Penglai path, coolness made.
Gradually, efficacy takes hold—
On Kunlun’s heights, auspicious signs arise.
Each island opens three gates,
With nine named halls of distinction.
Gradually, the Primordial Void’s silent origin emerges,
Then the gathered essence reveals the Original Yang.
Passing through the Hall of Clarity,
Gazing at the blazing scene—
Here, neighboring brilliance shines forth.
Residing here, now settled,
Dwelling in the immortal’s Penglai isle—
Spring’s essence refined, flowers and grasses fresh.
Summer’s heat blooms the red lotus.
Suddenly, autumn arrives early,
And cicadas sing in the willow pavilion.
A gale brings the northern wind,
Scattering white snow across the valleys.
A hundred years’ time like a flick of the fingers—
One true spirit, searching for profound mysteries.
Afterward, all is complete.
Nurturing harmony of spirit and qi,
Forging the radiant elixir into a perfect sphere.
The Five Paths gleam together,
Escorting ascent to the Great Luo Heaven.
By nature, compassionate—
Seeking the Mysterious Mechanism.
Wondrous principles ascend,
Desiring to ponder.
The body cannot escape—
Driven by the fires of familial bonds.
Love and desire fiercely abandoned,
Yet how to leave wife and children behind?
This elixir, once formed, splits in two—
If forced to act or rest, it follows inevitably.
But fear not its control.
Both halves united, all learn the Way of Non-Action.
At the end of stillness, each finds their place—
Only Master Pang knows this.

**耍蛾儿**
Not knowing how to cultivate—
Just nurturing an empty belly,
Kidneys, lungs, heart, liver, spleen—
Five clumps of foul flesh—what master are they?
First, drive away the Yellow Woman.
Confront the Azure Dragon and White Tiger,
No need for infants or maidens.
Gentlemen seeking the path of longevity—
There is another gate.
If one knows how to cultivate and seek the swift path,
The Full Reality’s gate opens wide.
Mercury knows Lead as its ancestor,
Securing the essence to halt the vital breath.
Even the inverted yin-yang numbers—
Today, clearly explained.
Depend on these four characters,
And soon you’ll return to the Dao.

**七骑子**
Truly, Master Zhongyang,
Met with a fortunate cause.
The cause awaits fulfillment—
Cultivate the Dao, become an immortal.
The immortals are awake and sincere—
The elixir’s single round pearl complete.
Auspicious clouds bear it to Heaven.
The Heavenly Master grants the White Flower Lotus.
The Lotus gleams most brightly,
Freshest, most radiant—
Radiant and fragrant, wondrous and profound.
Ascending to the Jade Emperor’s presence.
Leisurely steps drift—
Beyond the western suburbs.
Seeing skeletons lie,
Lying on the sandbank.
Ask why your fate is thus—
For love of children, wife, and kin.
Now suffering bitter wine.
Eyes grow sores, mouths fill with dust.
Qi chokes—cannot exhale,
Exhaling only rainbows.
Rain and wind scatter all—
Mostly, children trample them.
Regretting no good deeds in life.

---
*(End of Volume Eleven of Zhongyang’s Full Reality Collection)*
#1 This tune should be *"Golden Man Holding the Dew Tray."*
#2 This tune should be *"Duoli."*
#3 This tune should be *"Snow Plum Fragrance."*

**迎仙客**
To greet the Celestial Guest—
Practice must be sought with care,
True stillness, true clarity, true heart must be found.
This side verdant, that side white,
A head of black, a crown of crimson bright.
Together they dwell in halls of lapis,
Jade-petal blossoms bloom with crushed crystal dew.
Jade boys sing, golden boys clap—
Heaven’s choice has fallen upon the Guest.
This tune’s break, the first break enters—
The Guest’s place knows no break.
Examined, understood—
See how it splits my belly wide.
How does one do it? Just so—
Why sleep through the *ziwu* hours?
What’s said, what’s taught—
Self-wrapped in darkness, alone in practice.
This *haifeng* wind—my heart is broken,
A sudden end to this strange discipline.
No calamity, no disaster—
No seeking, no grasping, no ink-stained scholar’s fate.
Great Immortals chant, True Ones respond—
In the Full Reality Hall, no smoke, no flame.
Wu-you Child, with three companions,
Instantly cool, at ease, seated in freedom.

---

**香山会**
White radiance blooms with emerald hue,
Red splendor gathers in perfection.
Mysterious yellow shines with celestial depth—
Layer upon layer, pearls draped in splendor.
Through boundless skies, Daoists come and go.
Sealed with eternal title, now the Jade Emperor’s decree is received.
Within clouds and mists, the True Ones ascend.
At the Fragrant Mountain Gathering, pearly words unfold the Way.
Together they return to dwell forever in the Three Isles.

---

**红芍药**
Only when one is fully awake
Can one boast of true perfection.
Clear messages are seen—
Now the perfect midday sleep is taken.
This *ziwu* hour compels the spirit’s flow,
The Bottle Constellation—how could it be ignored?
When the Jade Door opens, lock the Golden Pass.
Lock the Golden Pass—
Never meet with lustful winds,
Nor fall to the fires of karma.
The Six Realms’ wheel is utterly avoided.
Free and unbound—
Above and below, white qi fills the void,
A single elixir grain, forged into gold.
From the sky, celestial music welcomes,
Heavenly flowers bloom in perfect order.

---

**塞孤**
My voice alone—who could measure it?
A maiden with green face, white limbs—
Stone Girl comes to respond.
Slender her form, her waist like a jade flute,
Soft and yielding, dancing in graceful sway,
Gold mirrors and pearl strings all at her command.
Let all be fulfilled, repay this merit.
At first scent of jade blossom’s fragrance,
It is the crystal flower crushed.
Two segments of moss, the same hue—
Even the Spirit Boys are ordered to pluck.
Together they meet—worthy of pity,
Displaying wonders beyond measure.
Rising above the Azure Han,
She gazes clearly.
With new melodies, forever as a Celestial Guest.

---

**双雁儿**
I urge you to the Western Realm—
Cast off restraint, wander as clouds.
Then you shall know no sorrow.
This worry fades, little by little.
Slowly, pull back the six oxen.
Recognize the waters, the grasses—
Your body becomes pure white through true cultivation.
Ascend in freedom, the boat reaches shore.

---
**自述**
The mind-horse, heart-monkey—do not let them stray.
The *haifeng* wind bears my name: Wang Zhe.
Since my heart broke, I’ve been turned upside down.
Fearful of dissipating old karma.
True nature, true spirit—what more is there to say?
Like dawn’s wind, the moon’s last light.
At the Yang Willow Ravine, all is clear.
I pluck at will.

---
**愍郭郎**
The Dao’s leisure is its own perfection—
A carefree little Immortal.

**《谨修增些福》**
I earnestly cultivate to increase some **virtue/power**—
Descend into the Yellow Spring.

**Foolish and bewildered**, I know nothing at all,
Only love a few coins of money.
When the great limit arrives one day,
I shall lament to the Azure Sky.

**Lost in delusion**, I follow the **Dao/Way**;
At leisure, I wander without hindrance.
Gazing alone at the brocade waves of the **Jinbo**,
And the verdant peaks of the **Qingdai**.

Turning back, I suddenly see beyond the desolate woods—
A heap of skulls lying, tangled in the reeds.
Who now owns this lone, pitiful place?
They are all **sorting** together.

My hollow eyes are filled with dust—
Earthly particles block my sight.
Rain washes, wind blows, sun scorches—
Stars shine in silent opposition.

For **karmic transformation**, I add layer upon layer,
Heavily burdened anew.
In strange lands and distant realms,
Where am I a guest? What age?

The shepherd boy arrives,
Frequently striking with his staff,
Desiring to scatter them.
In past lives, I coveted wealth and lust,
And clung to love.

**Lost in delusion**, how can I escape?
The **Hongchuang** tune—
**Liu Yue’s Dao/Way** is sincere and potent.
At the **Equal Community**, some recognize, others do not.

This is the **root of virtue/power**,
For the sake of **tranquility and benefit**.
I wish you would soon accumulate **auspicious causes**.
Seek the **Dao/Way** within your heart.

If you boast, you’ll topple like a balanced scale—
Do not let even a drop slip away.
Grind ink with a wooden slab and broken tile.
Before my window, the bamboo—
I see its true **effortless grace**.

Ask those who **skillfully point the tea**—
Who can truly **walk the Dao/Way**?
**Compassion and mercy** must not be abandoned.
Do good deeds by striking the cup—
Why wait for a silent sound?

Ask those who **abide in freedom and ease**—
How does **accumulating virtue** attain this?
Their appearance is pleasing,
Worthy of my likeness.
Empty hands, empty words—
The **Dao/Way** is broken, the home abandoned.

They can store thin vinegar, salt, and pickled greens,
Dried vegetables turned into fermented pastes.
I entrust them to **Zhang Gong**—
Steady and firm in your grasp.
Do not let them slip,
Crushed beneath your feet.
A hundred fragments, piece by piece,
Scattered when the time comes.

**Seventy-three, thirty-seven**—
At that moment, ponder **Wang Ji, Wang Ji**.
The cliffside is perilous, yet firm—
But guard against losing your footing.

I urge you to turn back, not to cling.
The **headwrap** remains only until
Next year’s New Year’s Day.
If you persist as before—
**Mind-horse, heart-monkey**—
Your lifespan will reach ninety.

But as a mortal, you must rely on **virtue/power**.
Do not scorn heaven or slight the earth—
Clothing and food will suffice.

This very night, however,
There is a **Wang San**, alone with his parents.
No comings or goings, no blankets or quilts.
Sleeping in his clothes, still and serene,
He will not stir or be disturbed.

When he wakes, he feels even more **cool and refreshed**,
Speaking only of poetry and melodies.
By next year, he will be **ripe with wisdom**.
This **lofty peak of the heart** remains unlit—
Unfathomable **kalpas** of waves,
Greedily grasping fame and fortune.
The earth turns to gold, yet it is still insufficient.

Why then do you not **plant good causes**,
For a better rebirth?
Do you not know that **two by two, three by three**,
We see **five by five, six by six**?
To honor **brother and sister-in-law**,
To provide **auspicious offerings**.

Even now, these are my **living parents**—
Who dares to face them?
But here, there is **Wang San**,
Whom I think of morning and evening.
Brother and sister-in-law, do not grieve or sigh.
Do not worry—
Purify your heart with **sincere reflection**.
The **fragrance of fame** is fleeting—
All three teachings **observe** it,
Yet **virtuous growth** flourishes.

This **Wang San** is **worthy of competition**.
He has extinguished **greed for wealth and lust**,
And wandered in the **threefold bliss of desire**.
Why then do you not **cease offering incense and wine**?
Even the **Immortal** loves this.

**Walking alone**, he is truly **free and at ease**.
To **conceal everywhere**, to **banish all demons**.
Many **heart sutras**, remembered clearly—
**No obstruction, no hindrance**.

**Wang Zhe**—
From my beginning, I have had **some offerings**.
I have had **some offerings**.

「The **Dao** is held daily with diligence,
Searching for hidden precepts.

The **Underworld** does not dare to glance.
In the **Heavenly Realm**, one naturally rejoices.
The **Penglai Immortal**’s island is like returning home,
And **cultivation** is fully realized.

*Wang Zhe* fears not the **harmful winds**—he cares nothing for them.
He delights in leisure, indulging in **effortless ease** and **indolence**.

A **paper robe** and **hempen clothes**—
Let others speak of their shortcomings,
For I know my own **coolness and warmth**.

A single **incense stick**’s worth of fame,
And ten **volumes** of **scripture**—
Three thousand **days** of **meritorious practice**,
And **fulfillment** is complete.

Steadily guiding the **auspicious clouds**,
Alone traversing the **Celestial Paths**,
Let him race the *Wang Zhe*’s **night-voyaging boat**.

#*Water Clouds Wandering*— **Equality, equality**.

Returning to **Laizhou**,
One must **rescue and deliver**.

The **harmful winds**—
**Transformation** is evenly distributed,
And those **transformed for the good** willingly return to **virtue**.

The **Two Principles** and **Three Radiances** are always upright.
**Examining** a person’s heart is like weighing with a **square scale**.

If not **highly elevated**, one sinks into **lowliness**—
Even the **Immortal** has **retribution**.

*Small Heavy Mountain*—
**Worthy of lamentation**, the calf, **worthy of lamentation**, the ox.
If you still **overlook** my words,
You are **of the same stream**.

**Nature** is like a **lamp**, **fate** like **oil**.
Mutual **nurturing** and **kindling**,
Flame **radiates**, illuminating the **mountain’s light**.

It **pierces** the **empty restraints** of a single **fasting day**.
The **path ahead** removes **perils**,
Avoiding **deep ravines**.

This time, I tell you the **root cause**.
**Meritorious practice** succeeds—
The **Penglai Island** brings **eternal peace**.

All **worldly folk** strive to **do something**.
**Honor** and **wealth** are sought in vain,
**Showing off** one’s abilities **does nothing**.

**Silken robes** and **meat feasts** are fought over in **worldly strife**.
Even if you **secure** a **single rank**,
What **is the point**?

*Wang Zhe* **does not strive**.
A **hempen robe** and **paper robe**—
He **suffers nothing**.

**Following the **flow of fate****, coarse food is his daily fare.
Only in **enduring longevity**,
Does the **true external world** recognize **non-action**.

A **single hempen sack**, a **single drift**.
My **three of us** live in the **Pure Dynasty**.
When **hunger** comes, we **pluck** **jade-like herbs**.
**Controlling** the **stomach**,
We **burn water** in the **fire**—
**Wafting sleeves** brush the **wandering winds**.

The **Azure Crane** leads the way ahead,
Treading the **cloud-tips**.

**Penglai Must Visit Old Wang Qiao.**
We **reaffirm our vow**—
Together we ascend to the **Celestial Dao**.

**Again, a dream:**
I dreamt of a cow before the street.
Its gait was steady, its nature gentle.
When pulled by rope, it turned its head.
On lofty peaks, it trod the moonlit heights—
Most **elegant in its freedom**.
**Follow me** as we wander at will.
In **harmony with the True**, we find **effortless joy**—
No sorrow lingers.
Its **pure white body** is worth lingering with.
**Transcending the mortal shore**, we enter **Yingzhou together**.

**Laughing in bewilderment**, I fail to awaken from illusion.
My **stubborn heart** is locked tight—
How can it open?
Even if wealth and rank bring no calamity,
**Heaven’s allotted span** will claim you in the end.
**Ghostly messengers** hasten your departure.
Sons and grandsons cannot **replace** you—
What **use is delay**?
Only then do you **wail in bitter regret**.
Now you know—
**Cultivating the Dao** is the **true material for transcendence**.

**Again, a Dao-friend inquires:**
**Nurture your nature**—
Do not **let anger arise**.
**Recognize the true body** within,
The **true head** that wraps it.
Daily **practice kindness** as **skillful means**.
**Cool clarity** resides
In **qi and spirit**.
**Avoid wealth and desire**.
**Naturally**, the **Great Dao** opens—
Awakening, **bright and clear**.
When the **Golden Elixir** is perfected,
You **cross the illusory ford**.

「Ascend the Cloud Path, gaze upon the Jade Cavern’s Eternal Spring.
In the Chrysanthemum Realm—
Flesh sells pastries, wine sells oil—
Nourish your body, not your gluttony.
Children and grandchildren frolic in play.
Gold and silver, jewels and treasures,
Piled like mountains and hills.
Why not seek the Dao’s path instead, leaving this transient world behind?
For when your Heavenly allotted span is reached,
Ghostly messengers will come to drag you away.
Only then will you realize your lifetime was all in vain—
Nodding, nodding,
Regretful beyond measure.

I earnestly advise my kin to cease their self-torment,
Knowing each day they dwell in mortal abodes.
Sleeping until the sun is high—
On days when flowers are sold,
There lies a deeper, hidden mystery.
This place, from the start, is truly magnetic—
Naturally quenching flames and dispelling smoke.
To enter the Path of No-Birth,
One must summon the Dao—
Only within the heart’s field.

Again, the spring arrives, yet emptiness remains.
Today’s handful of gentle breeze
Lets me drift like a wandering reed.
Before, I roamed the Cloud-Waters—
The Great Path stretches endlessly.
Though my heart may grow sluggish, my body must not lag,
For I know the finest medicine is *Xion* [芎].
Once taken, my body grows light and strong—
With accumulated virtue and merit,
I must ascend to the vault of Heaven.

**Preface to *Lín Jiāng Xiān*** [临江仙]:
Traveling through the capitals, prefectures, and counties,
And further still to towns, villages, and streets—
No skill or method can bind their endless chatter.
All is truly the same,
As the six senses clamor in iron-like discord.
Do not blame the constant echoes of pure sounds,
Nor those who call you forth from the household gate.
Polish your heart-mirror, lest it grow dim.
A full wheel of moonlight shines clear,
Its light piercing through Kunlun’s heights.
If you govern yourself and practice without faltering,
Your sincere heart will ascend to Heaven’s will.
Within, your essence is refined and radiant.
The numinous and true are sought with clarity—
Only then may you gaze upon the distant.

Hold fast with utmost reverence and single-minded devotion,
In stillness, pure and wrapped in return.
Rely upon the precepts, never straying.
The Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors,
Now join you in ascent together.

Master the precepts, guard them with constant care,
Bestow virtue upon all—your merit is foremost.
Your filial heart aligns with the divine.
Enduring and self-perfected,
Forever gazing upon your ancestral ties.
This is the true path of cultivation,
Unbiased and without faction.
Release your heart’s moon to illumine the Golden Lotus.
Fragrant incense ascends to the Azure Han,
Worthy to offer to the Great Luo Daoists.

**Again, on the Four Symbols** [四象]:
The nature of life and death, yin and yang—
If these may be discussed,
Then the heart, spleen, kidneys, and lungs are like a surgeon’s blade.
Further still, the south, north, east, and west.
The celestial stems and branches—
Jia, Geng, Ding, and Gui,
The birds and beasts—Wu, Ju, Hu, and Long.
Child and Midday harmonize, connecting Mao and You.
Spring, winter, autumn, and summer walk hand in hand.
White, green, red, and black—
The rainbow’s hues are revealed.
Kàn, Lí, Zhèn, and Duí—
Water, fire, wood, and metal ascend.

**Again, on the Gourd** [葫芦]:
One gourd, truly excellent—
Each day it follows me.
Its belly is bright, its core is empty.
It stores the elixir of jade and essence,
A taste surpassing even curdled milk.
Drink it daily, and it remains ever full—
No need for coin to buy.
With my staff, I lift it to the Cloud-Way.
Before the Three Pure Ones,
I pass through the Millet, Pearl, and Jade.
The crimson canopy is raised today once more,
And the pomegranate flowers bloom in time.
Who in this gathering understands the harm of the wind?
The Four *Wú* [梧] know my intent,
The Three *Yào* [耀] dispel my misfortune.
Having met, do not grow intoxicated—
Within the cave, there’s another feast.
A single cup avoids the wheel of rebirth.
Naturally, clouds fill my vision—
With each step, I reach Penglai.

**Again, a Dao-friend asks about cultivation:**
Purify yourself, preserve your heart for great goodness,
Ever act with compassion and kindness.
Observe the virtues of mercy and tranquility often.
The profound meanings of the Three Teachings,
All are fully realized here.
Renouncing wife and child is the highest noble,
Abandoning all wealth and desire is the true feast.
Nourish the five viscera to gain longevity.
Merit fulfilled and virtue complete—
With a straightforward nature, you enter the Daoists’ hall.

The *Tàiyī Hùnyuán* [太一混元] true scriptures of the Dao,
With a clear heart and sharp essence, practice with resolve.
First ensnare your own demonic corpse.
The Two *Xiāng* [香] lead to the upper realm,
Their power quietly applied.
Rescue lost souls, dissolve past karmas—
Seeing them preserved, you gain boundless blessings.
Ghosts tremble, spirits are awestruck by the pursuit.
The merit is evident—
Soon, colored clouds will follow you.»

「Drink the golden waves of the Western River’s water,
Each morning using this to swirl and cleanse.
Its cycle flows and turns back to pure spring.
The flesh and skin grow luminous and clear,
Longevity’s measure is prolonged.
The Northern Dipper naturally binds your lineage,
The Southern Star grants a birth for long years.

To reduce wealth and curb desires is the cause and condition—
To take Heaven as your reliance,
Abandon the world to become an Immortal.

Again, **目贻** [Mùyí]—
Why do you love alcohol so madly, like a gust of wind?
It is not because of foolishness, nor do you hold it so lightly.
This Daoist vision sees most clearly.
The Three Paths at the crown become manifest,
You gain companionship with the Daoist’s way.

The Three Teachings’ mysteries are profound and vast,
Yet still you cultivate their wondrous principles.
The Qilin first awakens to Zhongni’s [仲尼] cup,
The Azure Goat speaks to Yinxi’s [尹喜] insight,
The Relic calls to the Attendant Oriole [眷莺].

Again, **题赠道友** [Dìzèng Dàoyǒu]—
[□□] seeks the marvelous methods of Master Du,
[□□] first pursues the Dao’s foundation.
[□□] knows to grasp and modify with urgency.
[□□]’s affection is severed,
[□□] then turns back.
[□□]’s black smoke is all dispelled,
[□□] emerges without a care.
[□□]’s friends are clouds and companions are mists.
On the [□□]’s path to Peng Island,
Together we wander.
[□□]’s consort is now matched as a pair,
[□□] rides the tiger and seizes the dragon.
[□□] sets up a triple-layered pavilion.
[□□]’s spouse is beautiful,
[□□] follows with delight.
Before noon and after childbirth, [□□] refines,
The crimson glow is now complete.
[□□] dwells in the Vermilion Chamber.
On the [□□]’s path beyond the clouds,
[□□] reaches the Peng Palace.
In times of prosperity, [□□] must remain silent,
[□□]’s clarity earns the name *Dèng* [澄].
[□□] utterly abandons, utterly lacks power.
The [□□]’s pavilion enjoys fine scenery,
[□□] ascends in reliance.

The tea of Zhaozhou is of matchless quality,
[□□]’s enlightenment is as clear as water.
Cloud-friends and mist-companions,
[□□]’s parting is achieved,
[□□]’s ascent is now unceasing.

**Dìng Fēng Bō** [定风波]:
Each day, leisurely roaming west and east,
Living in dust, yet passing with the tide of fate.
Faint and boundless—ancient and modern alike—
Enshrouded in harm, like a drifting reed in the wind.
You only know of ants’ fleeting stirrings,
I now love the full bloom of the red hall.
The *Zhāoyī* [昭一] dispels the darkness of former years,
Empty and void, my spirit-refinery pierces the vaulted heavens.

Once, the first stage at Mount Jia,
Now, the Minister’s Sea bears its pure waters.
Again I cross the Jade Pool, truly attaining,
Abundant and bright, my head held high—
My own voice now recognized.
Moonlit silver waves and distinct scenery,
Jade tides and crimson currents earn high renown.
A white lotus rises, one bloom,
Fragrant and clear, it ascends straight into the Great Luo [罗] City.

**Tì Yín Dēng** [剔银灯]:
Now, I renew my awakening with deep sincerity.»

The primordial essence, unchanging from the beginning—
Swiftly cultivate with utmost sincerity,
Full and perfect, meticulously refined to its true form.
Transmit the Mysterious and Pass it on.
Through refining and tempering, it emerges—
Naturally serene and pure.
A single luminous pearl, worthy of reverence,
Now polished to radiant clarity.
Without the Original Master’s guidance,
The Three True Ones would not have arrived,
Nor would the Void-Space Sages gather to rejoice.
This celestial maiden’s fate was preordained here.
**Fēng Mǎ Lìng** [风马令]:
Tame the wind-horse—do not let it run wild.
On the long embankment, the *lúdīng* [瑠玎] drips clear.
At the trough’s head, the monkey plays its tricks.
Hooves gathered, ears pricked—it stands poised in the wind,
The *lúdīng* drips.
The tether on the stake is tightly bound to its shoe.
This time, you—*lúdīng* gleams.
When fully tamed, lead it back to the White Cloud Cave.
Even then, it won’t stay—*lúdīng* shines.

**Bǔ Suàn Zǐ** [卜算子·带暍马]:
First glimpsed, the green steel blade,
Within the corpse, its mark was set.
Planted on wood, a single thread emerged—
The *Gān Mǎ* [乾马] foretold,
After harm, the Wind Platform’s fate.
With this practice, progress grows daily,
Again and again, gathered.
In secret joy, only I know—
The Celestial Horse gazes,
Proving my eternal life.

**Yòu #2 Yè Yǒu Bù Yù** [又#2谒友不遇]:
Once, I saw Master Zhang,
Asking him to inscribe my heart’s intent.
King Rǎn [王喆] comes today, lingering near,
Yet no one stands close enough.
Turning back, I ride the clear breeze,
Clouds and mist follow my steps.
Returning to the Full Truth’s old hall,
I reclaim my luminous clarity.

**Tè Dì Xīn** [特地新]:
Heaven, Earth, and human life—
All gathered here to meet.
What must be made manifest and clear?
The Dao’s gate opens,
The Release’s gate unfolds,
The Confucian path is walkable.
Know the Primordial Origin,
Practice the Primordial Root,
Observe the Primordial Moment—
The Primordial Yang solidifies itself.
Sun, moon, stars—
All revolve in their courses.
Only when the Void is illuminated,
Do the *jīng* gates seal,
The *qi* gates open,
The *shén* gates transcend and reveal.
Drawing from the Three Powers,
Establishing the Three Teachings,
Attaining the Three Lights—
The Three Elixir Treasures converge.

**Quàn Shì** [劝世]:
Showing off skills and feats,
The body displays its forms.

「脱去衣衫，频频更换。 走遍茶坊酒店，总爱夸耀英雄。 忽见天高云淡，这豪情，早已减半。 再劝诸君，莫要迷恋红尘。 保护元阳，切莫让它白白耗散。 轻轻回头，睁开道眼，观看金莲。 玉花绽放，奇香飘来，吐出光明，满空辉煌。

**上林春令** [Shàng Lín Chūn Lìng]:
云水王三悟三悟，甘河镇祖师遇遇。 元本灵明便惺惺，也真个，诗词做做。
丹药内中频顾顾，逍遥处三光觑觑。 全得当时害风风，□真个神仙去去。
晴空如青玉案，放开心月，慧灯明照，两曜交光灿烂。 球装七宝玲珑焕，把性烛当中按。 一对金童呈手段。
琼杵推转，顺风归去，衮入那蓬莱观。

**带马行** [Dài Mǎ Xíng]:
亘初独许能骑坐，这骏驷，从牵拖。 直走盘旋双庆贺。
三山骨健，力筋偏大，马辅佐，万丈红崖过。 谢伊驰出深坑祸，衒玉辔，金缨亸。
喧嘶风雨游水火。 月华前面，四蹄轻锁，马负荷，与我成因果。
元初一得从初遇，便端正昭彰着。 转作重阳晨彩煦。
晴空来往，碧霄堪住，琼马腑，引入长生步。 灵光不动神光聚，便攒簇银霞护。
满插金花频返顾。 青衣鸾鹤，共同来赴，瑶马驻，般在清凉路。

**缘化子弟** [Yuán Huà Zǐdì]:
□□锁户真成也，□□百朝，甚惺惺洒。
□□冰餐非苟且。 □□玄妙，就中超亸，□□马，□□眸粘惹。
□□恩爱俱齐舍，□□□，闲游冷。 □□教余同幽雅。
□□仙子，共成修写，□□马，□□明星下。

**瑞鹧鸪** [Ruì Zhègū]:
昨朝今日与来朝，饮水无加只自浇。 醉后怨铺金藓甲，醒时复采玉芝苗。
锦衣公子谈三岛，皂帔佳人舞六么。 一曲合成玄妙处，白云片片恣飘飖。
我咱别有赤穷穷，物物俱无事事通。 清裹清来全寂阒，闲中闲至住虚空。
能邀迥照堪亲日，会捉轻飙便害风。 此际黑云何处去，莹然衮出一团红。
三才剖判做辉华，三教分明吐甲芽。 三宝炼烧红焰宝，三车搬运紫河车。
三峰影裹观真宅，三耀光中是本家。 三岛十洲堪捣药，三清十极聚青霞。
今朝细细问朱郎，因甚常眠黑鬼房？ 得与青龙为伴侣，亦令白虎助清凉。
便将铅汞堪成宝，好把刀圭更入钢。 斫断乌龟四只脚，爽邀风月上昆岗。
堪当姹女嫁丁郎，认得婴儿住癸房。 幸有甲田知出入，不无兑地做炎凉。
铅刀起处通神妙，汞剑开时仗慧钢。 杀却三尸阴鬼尽，一团红焰覆琼岗。
白灵根蒂长晴空，碧绿枝条袅细风。 叶禀月华添雅翠，花凭日气蘸殷红。
四般颜色虽然异，一道馨香分外浓。 透过丹霄归甚处，便教收在蕊珠宫。
石中火隐怎生昭，水裹金藏要却遭。 石火须凭心火取，水金决得肺金淘。
火教煅炼真铅汞，金要增添快剑刀。 二件相投成一件，大罗天上列仙曹。
这回捉住四时春，夺得温和养本真。 跳出世情居异世，尽教人道不凡人。
何须苦苦调精气，不在区区嗽液津。 莹处晴空开日月，锐然特放九光新。

**踏莎行** [Tà Shā Xíng]:
东海汪洋，西山详审，金钩钓得欢无恁。 一头活乐大鲸鱼，万鳞灿烂铺白锦。
随我遨游，水云信任，青山绿水相过甚。 张公吃酒李公来，李公夺了张公饮。

**干友打斧** [Gān Yǒu Dǎ Fǔ]:
（The second half of the *带马行* stanza remains untranslated due to missing characters, but the structure continues as follows:）
骏马驰骋，斧劈如风，友情干劲显无穷。

版斧如求，那由选拣，良工欲造无钱换。
The sought-after axe—who dares to choose it? A master craftsman longs to forge it, yet lacks the coin to trade.

今朝专礼我华宗，慈悲为首诸公辨。
Today, I pay homage to our Daoist lineage, where compassion stands foremost—distinguished by all revered masters.

若得坚钢，劈开道眼，灵台熠耀持金简。
Should I obtain unyielding steel, I shall cleave the Dao’s sacred eye—
the luminous spirit platform blazing with golden tablets.

腰间柯烂决忘归，白云路上成家产。
With axe-handle rotting at my waist, I forget all return—
my fortune lies in the paths where white clouds drift.

---
**咏镢**
铁镢神灵，我心有则，随身应手开端的。
The iron hoe’s divine might—my heart holds its essence,
ever at hand, ready to act at the first opportunity.

种成大药称伊功，栽生善果凭君力。
Cultivated into elixir, its merit is his alone;
planted as virtue, its fruit depends on your strength.

锉倒恩山，打摧爱狱，是非烦恼频频雕。
It grinds down the Mountain of Grace, shatters the Prison of Affection—
carving away the ceaseless carvings of strife and vexation.

锐然敲碎赋玞顽，便令发出昆仑玉。
Sharp strikes shatter the stubborn *fuyu*—
and lo, Kunlun jade emerges radiant.

---
**总咏**
斧锲堪擎，随缘斫冲，钢全生就令分局。
The axe and chisel may be wielded—
cutting as fate dictates, steel whole and ready to divide realms.

一司管刮水中金，一司管伐山头玉。
One office scrapes gold from the water’s depths,
another fells jade from the mountain’s peak.

窍子方长，攀儿圆促，头头柄柄常相逐。
The holes are long and square, the claws round and tight—
each head and handle ever in pursuit.

劈开金母紫芒攒，判通玉祖红光簇。
It splits the Golden Mother’s violet rays,
and cleaves the Jade Ancestor’s crimson luminosity.

---
**咏宦途无定**
名路求高，宦途无定，一来一去缘心性。
The path to renown is ever shifting—
officialdom’s way is uncertain, coming and going as one’s nature dictates.

稍知分守得优游，能通止足参贤圣。
A modest understanding of duty brings ease;
to master restraint is to consort with sages.

莫使偏颇，须存直正，花开须是依时令。
Do not stray from rectitude—
uprightness must be preserved, like flowers blooming in season.

日轮耀处吐光辉，月华朗后添清莹。
Where the sun’s wheel shines, radiance is cast forth,
and moonlight brightens with added clarity.

---
**渔父咏（渔家傲）**
北海馄鲸人不识，金风长是传消息。
The Northern Sea’s leviathan remains unseen by man—
the golden winds alone bear its tidings.

予把钓车宁费力。
I cast my fishing cart—what labor is this?

堪怜忆，香钩掷下离滩侧。
Pity the memory—
the fragrant hook cast aside where the shallows end.

吐出神珠光焰赫，化鹏展起垂云翼。
It spews forth divine pearls in blazing light,
transforming into a *peng* bird, wings trailing clouds.

日在扶摇无有极。
The sun ascends the *fuyao*—boundless in its rise.

能搏陆，青霄一举应端直。
It can strike the earth—
with one leap to the azure heights, upright and true.

---
**咏假俏汉**
奸点人人常不逊，外装内喜能谈论。
The deceitful mark is ever insolent—
externally adorned, inwardly delighted in idle chatter.

艳色衣裳香远喷。
His garish robes reek of perfume from afar.

频整顿，重重结裹粗如囤。
Frequently adjusted, layer upon layer,
bundled coarsely like a granary’s store.

眼去眉来常骋俊，前攀后拽夸身分。
His eyes and brows ever display cunning—
climbing forward, dragging behind, boasting of his station.

我便去前·亲去问。
I step forward to inquire directly.

休风韵，遮藏臭腐并堆粪。
Avoid his hollow elegance—
he conceals rot and piles dung.

---
**闲题**
生死轮回何太速，改颜换面人难识。
The wheel of life and death turns too swiftly—
faces change, and few recognize the shift.

有个风狂常自足。
There is one mad with wind, ever self-satisfied.

常自足，逍遥处处孤眠宿。
Ever self-sufficient, he drifts alone,
sleeping wherever the wind takes him.

愁煞诸公欢折哭，恰如堂下三间屋。
He vexes all with his joyous weeping—
like three rooms beneath a hall.

屋底你咱烦恼黑。
Within those rooms, our vexations fester dark.

烦恼黑，堂中我且燃灯烛。
Vexation’s darkness—
while I light lamps in the hall above.

---
**赠友人**
□□名宦为盐判，□□室内同公案。
[Name] holds office as a salt magistrate,
[Name]’s chamber shares the same official bench.

「□□ with idle thoughts, each half their own.
□□ praises, □□ divides—how can one sever?
□□ loves to keep company with clouds and waters,
□□ watches husband and wife atop the mountains.

□□ calls with the clear wind and bright moon.

□□ plays, □□ binds—
a boundless tally of entanglements.

The **River Transmission** decree: *"Bamboo crowns pressed to the top,*
*more bamboo as water bottles—*
*to this day, they still wash their hands with them."*

Bamboo staff, bamboo basket,
bamboo hat, bamboo cart, bamboo bundles.
In the bamboo grove,
the bamboo flute sighs,
its voice calling itself.

Wooden sandals pad the feet with true warmth,
wooden bowls polished—
mirrors round and flawless.

Wooden chopsticks, wooden spoons,
wooden ladles, wooden helmets, wooden bowls.
In the wooden shade,
the wooden ox plows,
three fields in a row.

With skillful means to sustain the body,
this hunger and cold are not escaped—
on the street, one must still beg for alms.

Lifting a pure and clear vessel,
bright and lucid as iron—
*□□* (awakened awareness).

Seeking what remains,
calling out, call after call,
**Dao/Way** seizes the chaos.

At the **Noble Residence**’s mercy, sighs resound—
I only hope that all may,
with hearts ever compassionate, take care.

Choose what’s cold to eat,
later to be seared in the belly’s crucible.
Refining the **Heavy Yang** (elixir),
one may then behold—
the **Dao/Way**-harmed man.

**Dao/Way**-harmed, fallen and broken,
he drifts like a tumbleweed in trust,
nowhere to rest, no fence to lean.

Roaming waters and clouds,
what matters if the body decays?
Seeking what remains,
near others’ homes,
in empty courtyards.

All laugh at my poverty and decline—
let them see my bones,
unfated to linger long.

Look how you don’t know—
where will you end up?

Avoid his sorrow—
when that time comes,
ascend to the **Blue Detached** (pure realm).

Ordinary flesh, no reliance—
take this lucid, awakened awareness,
and naturally the structure will be clear.

In walking, standing, sitting, or lying,
one must ever be serene and unburdened.

**Qi** and spirit harmonized,
form a pearl—
worthy of transformation.

Drawing bow and shooting arrow, he can strike true,
his **virtue/power** (red heart) piercing,
driving back the **Zhou Tian** (cosmic cycles).

Within the **stacked layers** (of the body),
entering and exiting—
priceless radiance like mist.

The **Five Phases** (elements) transgressed,
escaping **Yin-Yang**,
surpassing **Creation** (natural order).

Lamenting the **fragrant moment**—
by **heavy fate**, hands bound, feet planted.

"周天" may refer to Daoist cosmological cycles, while "害风汉" likely denotes a Daoist adept or practitioner suffering from external influences.)*

「Suddenly attaining the true and true without error.
A golden furnace stands, a jade flower blooms.
Refined by fire, this elixir emerges—
Three Fields and Nine Circulations radiant with dazzling light.
The Eight Vessels ascend, opening the Four Gates—
Voidness itself becomes a single, scorching point.
Wordless, yet naturally inviting.

All who study the Dao should be few.
Carefully grasp the subtle mysteries, ever unfolding.
At the head’s edge, recognize the Cooling Pillow.
When wind and moon meet, luminous repose is achieved.

The taste of the Swords of Immortality is savored again and again.
Gradually, a thousand petals bloom like embroidered silk.
Fragrance as profound as the Dao’s essence—
Lamenting the fragrant moment, savoring its hidden worth.

---
**Ode to the Purple Swallow**
I observe the purple swallow building its mud nest.
Daily it hatches eggs, cradling its young.
The fledglings grow, leaving the nest to rise—
Abandoning their parents, flying away.
For mortals, nurturing the small is like this:
Though they know how to climb, the bonds grow ever hotter.
Better to cultivate the Way of Eternal Life,
To delight in pure leisure, wandering among clouds and waters.

---
**On a Friend’s Inquiry About Yin-Yang**
Before Yin and Yang were divided, where was there form?
Only when Heaven’s height and Earth’s depth were settled.
Then Buqian and Kun separated, the Three Lights shone.
Within the body, the **Yin-Yang** (□□) **harmony** (冲和) **runs wild** (奔走).
Fire arises in water, battling again and again.
Then the White Tiger and Green Dragon engage in union.
Male and female offspring guard one another.
But the **Daoist adept** (害风汉) has other companions.

---
**Purple Swallow Returns** (青玉案带马行)
A blessed omen grows from the **Fuxiang Tree** (扶桑), a rare herb.
Planted then in **Penglai Island** (蓬莱),
Its golden branches and jade leaves are naturally fine,
On **Kunlun Mountain** (昆仑), they transform into treasures.
Mist radiates in all directions, deepening the mystery,
Flames envelop, dispelling confusion.
The **Celestial Attendants** (青童) present decrees, adding auspicious titles—
In the realm of **Wuwei** (无为), this is its return.

---
**The Spring Festival Command** (青玉案)
The true nature is vast and silent,
Hidden yet boundless, neither minute nor grand.
A cluster of luminous gems,
Bright light encircling, five colors in harmony.
Effortlessly wandering, worthy of passage—
With a **Jade Boy** (玉童) in attendance.
Filling the void with fragrance and richness,
Overflowing, it enfolds the face—
To accompany the **Immortal Ones** (神仙) in their gathering.

---
**A Hundred Years’ Reflection in the Mirror** (南乡子)
A hundred years’ visage in the mirror’s gaze,
Raising hands to bless, yet hands turn cruel.
Life and death, honor and decay—all now before my eyes.
Do not meet (this fate).
Swiftly return to the heart, recognize the **Ancestral Dao** (祖宗).
The **perfect forms** (得得妙相) follow,
Extinguishing the **Three Corpses and Nine Parasites** (三尸九虫).
**Qi** (一气) vast and serene, nurtured aright,
Purified—
The **Blue Rabbit** (兔击) **refines** (精蓝) beyond mortal measure.

**A Hundred Years’ Reflection in the Mirror** (南乡子)

---

**#1 On Parting from a Daoist Friend**
Wang Zhe has already migrated eastward,
Passing the assembly of sages at Ganhé River.
Internal hunger and cold still plague my being,
Travel expenses—beg from the virtuous among you, let them grant their own coins.
**Perfect forms** (得得) pass one to another,
Enlightening us both as we emerge from the Nine-Lotus [1].
How many hearts now grasp this truth?
Pitying, pitying—this parting carries the **Buddha’s original qi** (本气) onward.

I have now arrived in Nanjing,
Where every person in Gānzhèn knows my name.
Respect the **Three Lights** (三光) and recognize their essence,
Do not slight the **Five Grains** (五谷) within which the **vital essence** (精) is refined.
This journey marks my final course,
And I have set down my life’s own voice in writing.
If we meet again in this world,
Souls vividly—we shall behold the **true form**, **one qi** (一气) pure and clear.

Wealth and poverty alike may visit the body,
Yet one must embrace honor and decay with **virtue** (仁) alone.
Preordained fate now finds its use in this life,
With a pure heart—
**Ancestral merit** (阴功) and **blessings** (福) naturally attain perfection.

Do not further endure hardship’s bitterness,
Nor cling to wrongdoing—seek **auspicious causes** (善因) instead.
I urge the bewildered to awaken and reflect,
Do not harbor resentment—
All things follow **Heaven’s will** (天), not man’s.

---

**#2 *Wu Ling Spring* (武陵春)**
Charge the **Duke of Yan** (阎公) to return to his ancestral home,
And convey my words to the **Lingquan people** (醴泉人).
Do not lament their **greed** (贪求) or **anger** (嗔),
For they gain **vital spirit** (好精神).
This alone suffices as the **Great Dao** (大道),
Why seek **ultimate truth** (真) in vain?
If all can awaken to this **body** (此身),
Then they may emerge from the **dust of the world** (嚣尘).

---

**#3 *Bai Fei Lang* (买费笼)**
Willow branches supple, hemp threads fine,
A **mysterious hand** (妙手) binds with **arcane skill** (玄功).
**Subtle recognition** (密识) secures the **tightly knotted constraints** (牢缠系),
Fashioning the **body** (身儿) to perfection.

---

**#4 *On the Feast of Lingquan* (咏馎托)**
The inn is fine,
The **lingquan feast** (馎托) most wondrous and rare.
Endless **jade flakes** (玉屑) kneaded into dough,
A single **pearl-like flour sheet** (琼瑶) spread smooth and even,
Now let the **treasured blade** (宝刀) cut it clean.

To the **masterful hand** (妙手),
With steady intent—arrange it well.
Like **plum blossoms** (梨花) fresh upon a dish,
Silken strands of **silver threads** (银线) delicately lifted,
Feast upon it and hasten to **Penglai** (蓬莱).

---

**#5 *On Exhorting a Daoist Fellow* (咏劝道友)**
Duke Zhao is fine,
His noble bearing radiant in the prime of **Spring** (青春).
Do not let **light and time** (光阴) slip away in vain,
But earnestly cultivate **meritorious deeds** (功行) to draw near the **true essence** (实相).
Let us dwell as neighbors in the **Dao**.

**Serene and free** (清闲),
One must know the **crossing of delusion** (迷津).
A moment’s awakening dispels the **floating life** (浮生) of clinging desires,
As one understands the **illusionary nature** (幻化) and abandons **greed and wrath** (贪嗔),
Then is he a **hermit of the cave** (洞中人).

Not yet in the **Dao** (未入道),
Do not cling to **half-truths** (中迷).
First, **seize firmly** (牢擒) the **lowly horse** (劣马子),
And **bind tightly** (缚住) the **playful monkey** (耍猿儿).
Step by step, **cultivate with patience** (修持).

If one **awakens** (省悟),
Then **discern** (勘破) the **husband-wife bonds** (女男妻).
**At ease in the假 body**, ever **refining** (煅炼),
The **true nature** (真性) drifts freely—**pushed along** (推移),
Surely one attains the **Upper Pool of Reeds** (瑶池).

My words are earnestly offered,
Now is the time to **cultivate well** (持修).
**Fleeting fame and profit** (浮名浮利) when shall they end?
**Exhausting spirit and qi** (劳神劳气) when shall they rest?
Do not linger in the **dusty world** (尘世).

Awaken soon,
The **three teachings** (三教) hold **profound mysteries** (理玄幽).
Shake off the **Mountain of Karma** (恩山) and dispel the **Sea of Attachment** (爱海),
Return to **Penglai Island** (蓬岛) and journey to **Yingzhou** (瀛洲),
For all is **here, within this heart** (在此心头).

My words awaken understanding,
Now is the time to **cultivate well** (修修).
**Monkey-mind** (意马) and **wandering thoughts** (心猿) must all be **seized**,
Clinging affections and desires—**all must cease**,
Do not delay in **auspicious deeds** (善事).

The **three teachings** (三教) are fine,
Their **wondrous principles** (妙理) most profound and subtle.
Cast off the **floating life** (浮生) and **worldly affairs** (世事),
This time, the path ahead leads to **Penglai** (蓬洲),
Here lies the **true return** (归头).

---

**#6 *On the Apricot Blossom* (题杏花)**
Spring’s scene is fine,
Apricot blooms blush with crimson cheeks.
Laughing at the sun, its **divine form** (仙姿) truly beautiful,
Leaning into the wind, its tender face most wondrous and rare—
Not even the **plum of winter** (腊前梅) can compare.

Who truly knows?
Only the blossoms **allow me** (许) to gaze upon them.
I pluck a single branch to hold in hand,
Its fragrance fills my sleeves—let it return as it will,
I shall take you to **Penglai** (蓬莱).

---

**#6 *On the Apricot Blossom* (题杏花)**
Worthy to compare with the **Ode of King Wen** (王风),
A family’s fortune grows on its back.
**Roaming in the water-clouds** (水云游), its **spiritual nature** (灵性) and **wisdom** (慧) refined—
Its **use of food and clothing** (衣餐) and **deep-rooted face** (裹面) reveal its **true essence** (深根蒂).
To strip away the **coarse mortal body** (凡躯) and solve the riddle—
**Clarity dawns** (了了), **transcending** (超升) to its **divine form** (伊相).
*(End of Volume Thirteen of the *Zhongyang Quanzhen Collection*)*

---

**#7 *Instructing a Daoist Friend** (点化道友)**
Each and every one,
Ever guards their ** Daoist path** (铺).
The **Elder wraps them** (翁裹) beneath a **single hood** (合头),
Bound by **iron cords** (铁索) in **mystic ties** (缠缚).
How can they know its **radiant origin** (光耀处)?
It is **Divine Immortals** (神仙)—why not **open their hearts** (开心) and **awaken** (悟)?
Seek the **cool refuge** (清凉),
Gather **steady steps** (稳步).
If they wish to **drift to Penglai** (飘蓬),
Only **mad winds** (狂风) will suffice.
Or they may **lean upon clouds and waters** (依凭云水).
To claim **serene leisure** (清闲),
And walk the **Path of Effortless Wandering** (逍遥路).

Each and every one,
**Two months and eight days** (二旬八).
Do not **turn back** (回头),
Or their **life and vitality** (性命) will be **scoured away** (搜刷).
They’ll fall into **endless ruin** (沉沦),
Crushed beneath **constant pressure** (坠压).
When the **mirror** (镜子) is brought near,
What **words** (言) can they **answer** (谈答)?
It is **Divine Immortals** (神仙)—why not **perceive** (察)?
**Sever the mortal heart** (劈破凡心),
And **recognize the Buddha and Bodhisattvas** (佛菩萨).
A **single luminous pearl** (明珠) is polished again and again—
In the **Seven Treasures Palace** (七宝宫),
A **true golden tower** (真金塔) is raised.

---

**#8 *Giving to a Daoist Friend** (赠同友)**
This **Flower Sect** (华宗),
Can **follow my Way** (顺我).
With **pure intentions** (净意) and **clear heart** (清心),
They **recognize the Effortless Rest** (逍遥卧).
Daily, they **hide from the mundane** (便躲).
They **take the Daoist Master** (教公) as their own,
Finding **joy unbroken** (快乐).

**Turn back early** (早回头),
Do not **drift past** (休漫过).
**Extinguish all ignorance** (灭尽无明),
And **distance the ordinary passions** (远了寻常火).
A **single spark of Dao** (灵光) is locked upon the mountain.
**Steady their ride** (稳驾) on the **White Clouds** (白云),
And **sit within the Five-Colored Mists** (五色霞).

---

**#9 *Lamenting a Friend’s Body** (咏友人叹身)**
Reflect upon their **form** (身),
Seal their **mouth** (口).
They’ve **won serene leisure** (赢得清闲),
And **roam in effortless ease** (逍遥走).
As **fate allows** (随分),
They **should live forever** (应永久).
**Unrighteous wealth** (不义之财),
Let them **shrink back** (且缩) and **hold fast to the Clouds** (拏云手).

**Little by little** (少追陪),
**Sip wine lightly** (微饮酒).
**Moderate their desires** (节色),
And **search their original purity** (搜身).
They **recognize the Three Lights** (三光) and **filial piety** (兼孝),
And **friendly virtue** (友).
They **do not pray to deities** (不祝神祇),
Yet still **gain eternal spring** (也得长春寿).

---

**#10 *White Admonition to a Daoist Friend** (白告友人)**
In the **prime of youth** (正青春),
Their **ruddy faces** (红貌) gather.
**Bitterly** (苦肯) they **turn back** (回头),
Now **clearly** (分明) they **glimpse** (觑).
I wish they’d **awaken early** (心早悟).
**Live as neighbors to the Dao** (与道为邻),
And **dwell in effortless ease** (也处逍遥所).

**Good fate comes** (善缘来),
**Bad fate departs** (恶缘去).
They **see the true form** (搜见真容),
And **know it resides in the Spirit Platform** (灵台住).
The **Seven Seats** (七座) open,
Connecting to the **Great Ancestor** (的祖).
When they **leap free** (跳出),
They **enter the Path of Eternal Life** (便入长生路).

---

**#11 *Giving to a Daoist Friend** (赠于道友)**

---

**#12 *Giving to a Daoist Friend** (赠于道友)
To **cultivate the Classics well** (善修文),
They **can pass the imperial examinations** (能应举).
Why not **seek the Nine-Turn Elixir** (九转金丹)?

When the **Golden Tiger** (金虎) roars and the **Golden Horse** (金马) passes,

Six **immortals** follow me to the **Penglai** Isles.

**Peony** (Peony Order)
The Fourth Brother’s beard must be the **incense burner** (安炉灶),
Do not let his mind and body be in turmoil.
Luminous clarity is his innate true nature—
When **qi** is refined and nurtured, his spirit grows vibrant.

**Mercury and Lead** (汞铅) yield to each other’s essence,
Only then does one perceive the **Dao/Way** without name.
This night, who drinks wine together?
Recognize the days when **clear wind** and **bright moon** are close companions.

Again, **taking the elder sister as one’s present parents** (以嫂为见在父母),
The **King of Harmful Winds** (害风王) adheres to the **Longevity Dao/Way** (隆道).
Freedom and leisure are truly good.

Beyond sleep, he knows nothing at all—
A hundred flowers mock him for not seizing the moment’s advantage.
When virtue/power is fulfilled and practice is complete, he must depart early,
Taking the **cloud-path** (云步) back to **Penglai**.

A joyous meeting at the **Yao Pool** (瑶池),
Together plucking the **entwined peaches** (蟠桃) from the branches laden with past fruit.

**Midnight Immortal** (月中桂)
Falling upon the **Mid-Autumn Festival** (中秋),
Near the first watch, the **qi** is crisp and refreshing—
The wind stilled, the clouds dispersed.

**Vacuous void** (虚空) descends with dew,
Revealing a **clear sky** (晴天) across ten thousand leagues,
Displaying the **jade platform** (青玉案).
Lifting my gaze toward the seaside,
A **golden lotus disk** (金盘) emerges, radiant and dazzling.

Not only does every household shine,
Everyone rejoices together—
The poor and rich all vie to gaze.

Who can comprehend the **pure radiance** (清辉)?
This **silver rabbit** (银蟾) wraps its face,
Deeply concealed within **Yang’s calculations** (阳算).

Stars are sparse, lodges few,
The **magpies and crows** (鹊乌) fly away,
Taking **separation** (离) as their companion.

One full and round orb—
Right at noon, precisely half its cycle.

Ever more brilliant and resplendent,
The **nun’s courtyard** (庵前) beckons me to ascend the **Celestial Han** (冲霄汉).

**Golden Banana Leaf** (金蕉叶)
How can **entanglements of fame and gain** (名利牵缠) be thoroughly abandoned?
Who would dare to **bind all auspicious connections** (善缘总结)?
Dwelling in the **fire-house** (火宅) and often scorched,
Still entangled in the **chain of evil karma** (联恶业).

Cunning rivalry is no match for **guarding simplicity** (守拙),
Early departure from **clinging thoughts** (机心切切).
Slightly understanding the **secrets of the Three Teachings** (三教秘诀),
He is neither born nor extinguished.

**Willow Branch** (杨柳枝)
Life and death must be observed by oneself,
Carefully examined.
A blade at the neck—how painful and sour!
The most difficult trial.

Do not yet believe, but try the **needle’s test** (针略试) with caution—
Its agony is manifold.
**Generous intent** (发心) must be tempered by **awakening the heart’s chill** (觉心寒),
For that is the **far superior feast** (远佳餐).

**Scraping Drum Festival** (刮鼓社)
The **Scraping Drum Festival** (刮鼓社),
Within this **Scraping Drum feast** (刮鼓食), beats are struck.

Now the text reads:

「Yet when the **mung bean** (豌豆) emerges,
It surpasses wheat and barley in size.
It follows the five directions’ hues—
Green, red, yellow, black, and white combined,
And aligns with the five directions’ **auspicious patterns** (标格).

Steamed, stir-fried, boiled, roasted, or eaten raw,
Steamed to perfection, boiled, roasted, or eaten raw.
**Scraping Drum Festival** (刮鼓社),
Here within the **Scraping Drum feast** (刮鼓食) one may feast to fullness.

I observe the **mung bean** (豌豆) when it comes to fruition,
Its **vines** (圌) rise—then it must be stored in the **granary** (窖).
Do not harvest too much, nor begrudge a little.
Above, the **Three Lights** (三光) shine naturally—
Like chess, why laboriously strike the cannon?

As many know it as know it,
**West River Moon** (西江月)

To seek virtue for oneself,
One must first extinguish all **concerns of gain and loss** (虑思绝泯).
Reduce wealth and curb desires to nurture the **Field of the Elixir** (丹田),
And act appropriately when the opportunity arises.

The aged and young naturally have their **destinies** (禄),
So cease your endless toil and **fretful exertion** (苦苦孜煎).

Release a **lotus flower** (白花莲) into the open,
And the **West River Moon** (西江月) will surely appear.

**Master Wang Zhe** (王喆) harbors a **good Dao** (好道),
Yet **Harmful Wind** (害风) compels him to leave home.
His **entanglements** (攀缘) all vanish like clumps of sand,
Unfazed by his wife’s and children’s **curses** (咒骂).

He prefers the company of **clear wind and bright moon** (清风明月),
To **sleeping** (谕) even at the **four corners of the earth** (海角天涯).
Coming and going, he strides above the clouds,
This **effortless transcendence** (逍遥) is priceless.

**Nurturing the body** (养甲) is no match for **nurturing the mind** (养性),
**Cultivating the self** (修身) is no match for **cultivating the heart** (修心).
From beginning to now, all **effort and artifice** (做作),
Each day toiling for what?

He delves into the **subtle mysteries** (幽微),
And seeks the **profound principles** (玄理).
Let me teach you to **glimpse the gold within water** (稍悟水中金),
You shall not **waste time in desolate places** (荒郊) as such.

**Riverbank Moon** (川拨棹)

This **method of cultivation** (修行诀),
Is arranged with **order and sequence** (次节).
The ** Dao’s clear and tranquil essence** (清静天机),
Is revealed today—its **mysteries** (漏泄) made plain.
It causes all to **bloom like jade flowers** (玉花结).

From the start, each step is **steadfastly laid out** (稳铺设).
At the **first watch** (五更裹), glance and see the **array of myriad phenomena** (万象列).

Its **internal form and disposition** (位貌) are distinct.
In the **eastern direction** (向东方), it **blooms like jade flowers** (玉花结).
Silver and **pure essence** (素) refine into **gentle heat** (细得热).
The **tortoise** (乌龟) is tightly bound.
Then its **four legs** (四只脚),
**Fierce and twisted** (狞狞), are all snapped.
**Harmful Wind** (害风儿), how does one speak of it?

At the **first watch** (一更裹), a fleeting glance,

In the **eastern direction** (向东方), it **blooms like jade flowers** (玉花结).
Silver and **pure essence** (素) refine into **gentle heat** (细得热).

**Fierce and twisted** (狞狞), are all snapped.
**Harmful Wind** (害风儿), how does one speak of it?

At the **second watch** (二更裹), a fleeting glance,
To see the **endless flow of the Milky Way** (天河流无竭).
Suddenly, waves surge **bright and vast** (耿耿洪波),
Sparkling and **radiantly clear** (泼滟滟底昭彻).
In the **western direction** (向西方), it **blooms like jade flowers** (玉花结).
**Golden sprouts** (黄芽) emerge, yet not **nirvana’s** (涅) hue,
The **tip of the tortoise shell** (甲尖) strikes **white snow** (白雪).
Here is a **spirited child** (灵童),
Who waves his hand and personally snaps its legs.
**Harmful Wind** (害风儿), how does one speak of it?

At the **third watch** (三更裹), a fleeting glance,
To see the **silver hare** (银蟾) round and unbroken.
It emits a **wheel of luminous light** (一轮光明),
Filling the sky with **distinct clarity** (莹然有别).
In the **southern direction** (向南方), it **blooms like jade flowers** (玉花结).
The **white deer** (白鹿) comes forward, **stealing** (行得窃).
It **seizes its newly bright and pure** (新皎洁) essence,
And carries it to the **peak of the Gui Hills** (圭峰山头),
Alone, **gnawing softly** (啮啮) within its mouth.
**Harmful Wind** (害风儿), how does one speak of it?

At the **fourth watch** (四更裹), a fleeting glance,
To see the **Big Dipper’s** (斗) stars blazing like a furnace.

「Shining through all the void with pristine clarity,
It radiates boundless luminous *qi* (灵辉) sharp and pure.
In the **eastern direction** (向东方), it **blooms like jade flowers** (玉花结).
The **three mountain peaks** (三山) gather torches like lightning streaks.

**Harmful Wind** (害风儿), how does one speak of it?

At the **fifth watch** (五更裹), a fleeting glance,
To see the **Polaris** (魁□) without defect or flaw.
It aligns perfectly with the **Heavenly Heart** (天心), **directing the cosmic order** (斡运),
Worthy to serve as **Heaven’s throat and tongue** (上天喉舌).
In the **central direction** (向中央), it **blooms like jade flowers** (玉花结).
**Seizing** (捉得) the essence of pristine clarity this time,
It **forever banishes** (永永除) the cycle of birth and death.

I **observed** (观得) the **jade flower formation** (玉花结).

**[Title missing]** #3

The **nature** asks: *"Why must this maiden wed?"*
This **boundless youth** gallops wild—
**Radiant flesh**, ever luminous, ever bright.
Lead and mercury blend, **qi** refined,
**Divine stillness**—then heaven’s hammer strikes.
**Lord Li’s** true essence, **Lord Li’s** true essence,
**The fool** and **Ox-child**—like ink spilled black,
Dragged back, yet turns not round.
To rivers, fields, they crave the water, grass,
**Unbridled** in their wanton flow.
**Endure this restless heat**—
Whip harder, spur them on.
**Beat them senseless** till they freeze to frost.
**Drunken Moon on the River** (*Pine-Slave’s Grievance*)
**Heart unbound**, **careless ease**—
Let worms dissolve, let corpses fade.
**Serene stillness** guards the **precious vessel’s mouth**,
**Opening and closing**—though powerless to turn,
**Preserve the essence whole**.
When **three suns** meet, **five spirits** gather bright,
Yet though you sleep, you wake not—
**Nourish the face**, **pure as jade**, **countless days**.
Till **clarity** dawns, **true soul** awakens clear.
**Nature** forms the elixir—
**Round light** blazes—**Master’s grace** reveals.
**Crimson clouds** swirl—then **welcome home**.
**Plum Blossom Tune**
**Little fortune**, **early orphaned**,
**Withered**, **helpless**, **no one to confide**.
**Daily thought**, **daily thought**—
This truth is clear, **heaven knows**.
**Urgent summons**, **urgent summons**—
**Serving brings** your **blessings multiplied**.
**Filial heart**, **filial heart**—
**Move the divine**, **great blessings** follow.
**Human fate**—born in **China’s land**,
**Clothing, food** by **ancestral grace** ordained.
**Life’s lot**—**sigh**, **sigh**—
**Heaven gives poverty**, **no wealth to rest**.
Like **grass-dew**, fleeting as man’s breath,
**Morning’s keep**—**no evening’s trust**.
**Seek not force**—
**Seek not force**, though you strive,
**Grasp it hard**, it slips away.
**Follow fate**, **live content**—
**Greed and fear** are all delusion.
**Noble kin**, **wealthy neighbors**—
**Pity the lone**, **comfort the aged**,
**Take and give** as **heaven’s truth**.
**In power**, **do not oppress the weak**—
**Beware** when **fortune turns**.
**Diminish arrogance**—
**Diminish pride**, high or low,
**Equal all**, as one.
**Sūtra of the Blue Lotus** (*Holding the Cup*)
**Recognize it now**—**no need to part**.
**Deep jade caves**, **coral light** shines faint,
**Dragon coils**, **tiger winds** around the **jade flower**.
On **West River’s waters**, **crows fly past**—
Till **Green Boy** takes his post.
Then **wear the jade crown**—
**Trickery’s garb** is vain.
Only here **forever stays**.
**Ugly Slave’s Lament #4**
**A disciple asks of transformation**:
Alas, within **yin-yang’s vast design**,
**Creation’s work**—no **west or east** to speak of—
Only in **three luminaries’ refined qi**.
If you **grasp the swift footing**,
**Free as a drifting cloud**, **cast off mortal bonds**,
A **true spirit** soars into **azure sky**.

**Again** (*Kunqi Mountain*)
**Sunrise at the Mulberry Tree**—
**Penglai Island** near—
If you would **truly meet**,
**Only emptiness** will do.
**Unbounded ease** alone brings you there,
**Gazing down** on **lost souls’ shore**,
**Refined till wrapped**—
A **peaked gem** gleams on high.

**Waves Swept Sand**
**All things** press not,
**All things** have no heart.
**Essence preserved**, **qi** nurtured—**source profound**.
**Ancestors’ grief** grows deeper still,
**Monkeys, horses** tightly bound.
**Jade trees** bloom first,
**Flowers split gold**.
**Fragrant mist** drifts from **lofty peaks**.
**Ten thousand silver rays** gather—
Then **joyful music** sounds.

**Again** (*Lotus in Fire*)
**Yang-qi** pierces **heaven’s blue**—
**Endless**, **endless**.
**Earth’s gate** burns fierce as well.
From **water’s depths**, **nature’s spark**—
A **red lotus** blooms.
**Early recognize** the **spring**,
**Seize the cause**.
**Tortoise’s mouth** exhales **sacred smoke**.
**Cinnabar field** perfumes—**fresh**, **new**.

**Again** (*Selling the Form—Spoken Lines*)
**Live by truth**, **no falsehoods spun**,
Though **fortune comes**, **no boastful cry**.
**Blessings grow**, **family honored**—
Like **waves swept sand**, **deep sighs** arise.
If **court’s reach** does not touch you,
**Two masters** rejoice—**you ride the clouds**.

**Brocade Hall Spring**
**Ask of practice**—
Just **stepping through the door**—
How **begin**?
Let **joy** first **unfold within**,
Then **slowly seek**, **steadfast**, **pure**,
**Dispel desire**, **quiet the mind**.
**Playful ease**, **unbounded peace**—
**Search deep**, **record the subtle**,
**Often write**.
**Sudden awakening**—
**Serene**, **transcending** **suffering’s maze**,
This **vision**—**clear**, **original**—
**Return to source**, **light reborn**,
**Alone**, **no trace remains**.

**Tile Basin Song**
**You strike**—
**Swift**, **loud**!

**No omens, no calamities.**
Who knows whence this comes?
The outer lips have mouths to utter scriptures,
The inner void has a belly forming cause and effect.

Noble or lowly, wise or foolish—**ponder deeply**,
Each person casts one.
This **wild wind of awakening**—
**Unwilling to vie with others or oneself.**

**Dispel vexation, quench the mind’s fire.**
Day by day, **follow fate’s flow.**

**Unbounded ease in action or stillness,**
**Merit complete, virtue fulfilled—**carrying clouds aloft.

**Encased ascent at such a time—**
Only then does one know **the shell must be broken.**

**Hail the Sacred Reign**
In the **midwinter’s fine season**, the **spirit-child arrives**,
Reporting **yang-qi’s** first ascent.
**Golden sprouts burst forth, jade nectar waters them,**
Layer upon layer of **honored splendor**.

The **Jia-stem’s** **pure luster**, the **Geng-stem’s** **metallic hue**—
Interspersed stars **align their power**.
With **auspicious pearls**, **radiant and blessed**, they welcome **luminous light**,
Soaring beyond the clouds.

**Painted Night’s Music (藏头词)**
□ **Gold** separated—**do not let it err**,
□ **Years**—how does one act?
□ **Before the head**, what **sly deceit**,
□ **At the hour’s mark**, steady hands and feet.

□ **Drawn by hare-light’s fate**, **destiny’s wheel turns**,
□ **In ordinary times**, **rooted in search**.
□ **Matter bears divine power**, **clear qi leaps**.
□ **Below**, **leaning on me for support**,
□ **Scripture’s text**—**no elixir**.

□ **Heaven knows fate’s high peak**,
□ **Discourse**, **discourse**—
□ **Within**, **another layer**.

□ **The Master seeks cool relief**,
□ **At the city’s southern pavilion**, **ascending the tower**.
□ **Each finds its place**,
□ **Joy at dawn, delight at dusk**.
