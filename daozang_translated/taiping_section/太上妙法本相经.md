**The Supreme Wondrous Dharma’s Original Form Sutra, Fascicle One**
*(The preceding portion is missing in the original.)*

The mind may be focused, yet no flesh is to be cherished, no bone to be prized.
Neither forceful nor weak, it functions solely through transformation.
Practiced, it exists; abandoned, it vanishes.
If one seeks its origin, it drifts like a fleeting impulse;
if one probes its source, it defies all foundation.
Radiant yet not dazzling, still yet not silent,
it cannot be clarified by settling, nor muddied by stirring.
Praised, it gains no glory; slandered, it suffers no disgrace.
Honored, it is not exalted; rejected, it is not diminished.
Revered, it receives no benefit; slighted, it is not uprooted.
Neither diminished nor enhanced, it abides in effortless non-action.

The Discerner says:
Pure and true, non-action—without reliance or attachment.
Slandered, it is not disgraced; praised, it is not glorified.
Revered, it gains no benefit; slighted, it suffers no loss.
Without harm or disgrace, it is simply non-action—
why then expound teachings? Why require devotion? Why strive to practice?

Why then engage in vain labor? It is better to remain serene and still, following the four qi, employing them to their end. Human life is impermanent, departure and abiding never cease—would it not be better to dwell in ease?

The disciple says: One may cultivate to attain great fortune, yet if one abandons what cannot be relied upon, striving to attain immortality, one falls into the three lower realms. By reverently practicing divine blessings, disgrace and misfortune arrive—how can this compare to the task of pure and true non-action, the teaching of vain striving, the method of no benefit?

The answer says: That which is pure and true is the Dao itself. If one practices it, one practices it for oneself; if one strives for it, one strives for oneself; if one reveres it, one reveres it for oneself; if one reveres and upholds it, one does so for oneself—what benefit does this bring to the pure and true? One seeks benefit for oneself, not to benefit the pure and true; one seeks deliverance for oneself, not to deliver the pure and true; one strives to cultivate for oneself, not for the pure and true to strive; one seeks the Dao for oneself, not for the Dao to seek one.

Thus, the perfected person first endures hardship and toil, then obtains great joy; first reveres and upholds, then attains true honor. If one disgraces the Dao, one harms oneself; if one slights the true, one slights oneself; if one abandons the Dao, one abandons the Dao for oneself; if one slanders the true, one slanders the true for oneself. Why is this so? One curses the echo, not the echo cursing one; one reviles the true, not the true reviling one; one slights the Dao, not the Dao slighting one; one brings misfortune upon the Dao, not the Dao bringing misfortune upon one; one destroys the Dao, not the Dao destroying one; one poisons the Dao, not the Dao poisoning one.

Why is this so? It is like a strong crossbow shooting at the sky—its arrow must return. Thus, one shoots at the sky oneself, not the sky shooting at one; one curses the echo oneself, not the echo cursing one. Therefore, poison does not move of itself, misfortune does not arise of itself—all is summoned by the actions of body, mouth, and mind.

Thus, the body is the root of the three evils and the foundation of immortality. It is called:
1. The field of good fortune,
2. The garden of suffering,
3. The household of seeds,
4. The gate of distant life,
5. The realm of the Dao,
6. The village of pus and blood,
7. The vessel of treasures,
8. The bowl of shards,
9. The chamber of bright wisdom,
10. The darkness of the nine nights.

One who understands this principle may be called a perfected person. When merit is complete and virtue is perfected, one becomes the boundless honored one of the three realms. Ever joyful, without limit, one becomes the distant and lofty Supreme Immortal. Adorned with myriad excellences, vast wisdom spans the great thousand worlds. Merit and virtue are not false, and in the Dark Capital, causes and conditions are reckoned. Hearing this and generating a good mind, one is without a single karmic tie for ten thousand kalpas. Following one’s karma, one scatters and departs—hell, hungry ghosts, and animals become one’s familial cause.

The Discerner says: As the Heavenly Worthy has said, one seeks the Dao for oneself, not the Dao seeking one; one seeks deliverance for oneself, not the Dao delivering one. Therefore, teachings are established, texts preserved, prohibitions and precepts set forth to restrain and guide. If the Dao does not seek to deliver people, why should it institute methods and teachings to move the people and all beings? If the Dao does not rely on people, what then should people devote themselves to? Is it because the Dao is good for the people and esteems their kinship?

The answer says: The Dao has no partiality—does its transformation extend to all? People draw near to the Dao themselves, and through resonance, results are attained. Prohibitions and teachings are not applied to one alone but extend to all. Yet it is people themselves who seek prohibitions and precepts, restraining body and mind, binding speech and conduct.

Thus, what does the Way of the sage seek? Only that those with minds set their will upon it! Therefore, people can magnify the Dao, but the Dao does not magnify people. The Great Dao is non-action, abiding in spirit with tranquil indifference—what does it seek from people? It is people who magnify themselves, not the Dao that magnifies them.

Thus, the nature of the Dao universally nurtures, not just one kind—why should it exclusively magnify humans? In the lands of the ten directions and the great thousand worlds, with myriad forms and names, all are reached by it, yet it does not rely on one kind to transform all. Thus, it universally pervades all forms and names—how could it magnify humans alone?

How is this known? The Dao generates heaven and earth, establishes yin and yang, arranges the sun and moon, sets the stars in place. It circles the heavens in three hundred and sixty-five degrees, with the calculations of waxing and waning, the four seasons alternating in succession, not a hair’s breadth in error. It gives birth to the forms and names of people and the myriad kinds, crafting all things—how could it magnify humans alone? Thus, it does not magnify humans alone.

Therefore, all superior beings seek the Dao for themselves and seek deliverance for themselves. Why is this so? It is like water: one seeks to cross it, and so comes to cross the water. One knows that water does not cross people—people cross themselves. Thus, the Dao does not deliver people; people seek the Dao themselves. The Dao does not covet the people; the people covet the Dao themselves. If the Dao coveted the people, there would be distinctions of near and far; if the Dao coveted deliverance, there would be natures of advance and retreat.

Thus, the nature of the Dao is tranquil and indifferent, without partiality or favoritism, without self or other. Its compassion and kindness nurture all equally. Why is this so? It is like giving birth to ten children: when they are infants, one universally loves and cherishes them, without desire to abandon any. If there is the slightest discord, one rushes to consult shamans and diviners, inquiring about their future. Hearing of decline, one’s liver shatters; hearing of good fortune, one leaps with joy. One nurses and rears them with tender care, anxious for their growth.

Yet when they mature, they focus solely on their own plans, turn against their parents, disobey commands, reject teachings, show no harmony in countenance, speak with hostility, and utter harsh words near and far, so that neighboring villages regard them with disdain. Their evil deeds fear the shadow, and they flee in haste, ceasing only at death. Though their forms perish, their names endure—fragrant or foul, ever present.

If one or two children are obedient in word and fate, harmonious in countenance, their goodness is heard of far and wide, and their village follows their example, with songs of praise never ceasing at the crossroads. Among ten siblings, fragrant or foul, their uses differ. Thus, the Dao’s compassion for all beings is like the twelve kinds of parental kindness.

When they mature and are filial, their conduct follows their own will. Therefore, when parents are upright, they know that the filiality of bearing and rearing depends on the child; when the Dao is upright, it knows that the reverence and devotion of the people depend on the people themselves.

Thus does the Dao cherish all beings as a mother loves her child—without partiality, without desire for gain. The Dao’s compassion and a mother’s love are alike in this.

The disputant said: "We receive the third grace. I would ask further of its meaning."
As the Heavenly Worthy has said, the Dao cherishes all beings as a mother loves her child, universally pitying all without abandonment. Yet I observe in the world those who suffer calamity—unable to advance in life, unwilling to retreat in death—whose sorrow shatters the heart, whose weeping moves the trees, whose tears wet the beasts, whose cries grieve the birds. Those who see forget themselves; those who hear weep in sorrow. Their anguish and torment cannot be endured. If the Dao is truly great in compassion, should it not pity and save them, delivering them from such suffering? If the Dao does not pity or save, then by this evidence, can we say it possesses compassion or extends grace to all?

In ancient times, the orphaned child’s grief moved the river’s corpse to halt its flow; the abandoned infant at Fanyang was suckled by a divine beast. Even mountains and rivers respond with compassion—how much more should the Dao? By this reasoning, can we say the Dao lacks compassion, that the Sage lacks sorrow, that it stands alone and apart, bearing the burden of non-action?

The answer came: All beings possess their own karmic conditions. Whether sorrow or grief, suffering or affliction, these are predetermined by past deeds. Thus, the river’s corpse and the abandoned infant—why did their currents cease? Why was the infant nursed? It was I who sent the dragons to halt the flow and the divine beast to nourish the child. Do you not know this? The river spirit knows the flow of water; the tiger knows its killing. Why do they not act thus? It is because of me!

The disputant said: If the Dao is responsive, then there should be no suffering. If the Dao is compassionate, then none should be forsaken. Yet the world lies in ashes, and even those who perish receive no deliverance. Does this not prove there is no responsiveness, no compassion—only the workings of transformation? If not, then there must be two Daos: one that governs poverty, suffering, orphanhood, and disaster, and another that governs long life, wealth, and natural bliss. By this reasoning, we must acknowledge there are two.

The answer came: All beings possess their own causes and conditions. Longevity or brevity, suffering or joy—these are fixed and unalterable. Past karma is already set; its retribution cannot be uniform. Thus, the fruits of karma are never false, and their recompense is without exception. It is like planting seeds: what grows follows what was sown. Can anything grow from what is not its kind? The fruits of poverty and wealth, suffering and joy, are likewise.

Why is this so? A single mother may bear four or five children, yet their height, complexion, beauty or ugliness, lifespans, and stations in life all differ. This proves that the seeds of past karma cannot be altered. As for your questions, you have now heard the answers.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Were it not for your inquiries, the multitude would remain ignorant. Were it not for your seeking, the multitude would never resolve their doubts. Now, the light of your single lamp suffices to illuminate ten thousand miles. If you still have doubts, they are not truly doubts; if you remain perplexed, it is not true perplexity.

The disputant said: "I receive this grace. Yet the six defilements remain unclear, and my doubts are many. Though I have asked several questions and gained some understanding, lingering uncertainties crowd upon me. My heart is not yet at ease, and I wish to ask further."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "If you have doubts, you must ask, lest you carry confusion and uncertainty, losing your way in this very life."

The disputant said: "I humbly receive this heavenly grace once more. As the Heavenly Worthy has said, all beings possess their own karmic conditions; poverty and wealth, suffering and joy, high and low station, long and short life—all are received according to past karma. But I wonder: for those who are poor, suffering, orphaned, or lowly, if they cultivate goodness and accumulate merit, can they still attain blessings? If they do not seize the opportunity, will they continue to wander through evil rebirths? I beseech the Heavenly Worthy to explain these causes and conditions, that all who are poor and suffering may hear and understand."

The answer came: "Your question is most essential and profound. Sit upright and listen carefully, for I shall explain. All beings—whether suffering or joyful, noble or base—receive retribution in this life according to the karma they cultivated in past lives. For those who are poor and suffering, know that poverty is not a place to dwell. Exert yourselves in fasting, almsgiving, bowing in reverence, offering incense and water, helping others bear their burdens, yielding the path to the elderly and distressed, practicing abstinence, and exhorting others to goodness. When all these virtues are fulfilled, you shall attain the Way of the Great Perfected. Can you then still speak of poverty?

A poor man’s offering of a few coins is equal to a king’s gift of a hundred gold pieces. A single bow from one in suffering is equal to a lifetime of renunciation. Why? In poverty, one has little to spare, yet if one gives without reluctance, the merit is vast and immeasurable. In suffering, one has no leisure, yet if one remembers the Dao and bows even once, it surpasses the lifelong renunciation of the indolent. Thus, a lotus blooming in boiling water—can this not be called difficult? Karma has no fixed constancy; all actions receive their due recompense.

The danger lies in poverty itself—knowing there is a Dao yet always falling short of others. The danger lies in orphanhood and lowliness—failing to believe in causes and conditions, thus remaining forever in that state. Therefore, the true person, seeing this peril, cultivates and studies the Dao, and so becomes a true person. If suffering beings recognize the repugnance of suffering and the desirability of joy, and practice accordingly, they are equal to the Ten Immortals. Why? Knowing suffering, they endure it, and so ultimately transcend it. Recognizing lowliness, they abandon it, and so escape it.

Why is this so? All beings possess the nature of joy and the nature of suffering. Below the rank of the Immortals, all dwell within these natures of suffering and joy. Above the Immortals, they forever part from suffering—how much more so the Dao? Thus, the karma of all beings has no fixed constancy; retribution follows action without exception. How can there be any distinction of kind?"

The disputant said: "I receive this grace. I would ask further of its meaning."

"Now, I inquire: of the true persons as numerous as the sands of the ten directions and all the great sage assemblies who have attained the Dao—by what qi were they born, and by practicing what Dao did they achieve this karma, thus receiving their present retribution?"

The answer came: "The true persons as numerous as the sands of the ten directions and the assemblies of sages who have attained the Dao—none are not those who have cultivated the *Scripture of Original Form*. The Original Form encompasses all that is vast and enters all that is minute; its teachings widely expounded, it delivers boundless heavenly and mortal beings, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, beyond reckoning or record. Like a floating bridge across the Yangtze and Han, since the beginning of the kalpas at the source of the waters, it has delivered beings without measure, beyond count. Since the revelation of the Original Form, the deliverance of all sage assemblies has been likewise.

If you cultivate the scriptures, maintaining unbroken purification and precepts, your merit and virtue complete, you too shall be equal to the Ten Immortals. For the Ten Immortals originally arose from the suffering and toil of ordinary beings, enduring hardship to attain radiant illumination. How much more so for one whose past karma is vast, whose present life is endowed with keen intelligence, profound wisdom, and penetrating insight into the mysterious origin? Your merit equals Mount Kunlun, your virtue matches the abyssal sea; the attainment of the Ten Immortals is not even a hair’s breadth beyond you.

Why is this so? When your two mirrors reflect one another, all darkness is universally dispelled, and you wander the Dao of the Upper Clarity. The golden script and jade secrets, the purple writ recording your name—like a shadow born of preceding radiance, you are fixed in the Central Sun. Your virtue and origin are likewise."

The disputant said: "So it is, so it is! The assemblies of sages who have attained the Dao depart in numbers like the sands of the Ganges, with none returning. Now, those who begin cultivation are also as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—will they reach an end, or is there no limit? If there is no end, they will depart without cease; if there is an end, causes and conditions will perish. I humbly request clarification."

The answer came: "So it is, so it is! Their departure in numbers like the sands of the Ganges is not considered many. When the reckoning of the Nine Heavens is exhausted and heaven and earth are reduced to ashes, even then the ants and all creeping things will arouse the mind of goodness. After passing through a thousand heavens, those who attain the Dao will still not be considered many. When all creeping things arouse the mind of goodness, the multitudes of the ten thousand kinds will universally ascend to the Jeweled Capital within the Purple Tenuity. After passing through a thousand heavens, those who attain the Dao will still not be considered many.

Thus, emptiness cannot be filled, and the void cannot be made substantial—this is called the *inconceivable realm*. A pearl’s mouth receives the multitudes yet is not cramped; the boundless expanse of eternal joy contains all yet is not filled. How much more so for emptiness and the void?"

The disputant said: "I receive this grace. I would ask further of its meaning."

As the Heavenly Worthy has said: when the kalpa’s end arrives and its destiny is fulfilled, all beings will universally attain the Dao, with none left behind. For those who undergo endless rebirths—what need then for teaching, what pursuit of a master, what toil in diligent practice, what reliance on the Dharma? All such efforts would be but self-imposed hardship. Would it not be better to sit in tranquil repose, seeking only the sustenance of millet and fowl?

The reply: A hundred years of suffering is not equal to one year of joy before death. Ten bolts of coarse cloth cannot compare to a single length of brocade. Do not birds and sparrows live out their three hundred days of fate? Yet they are not equal to a human’s single year. A hundred pounds of iron are not worth ten copper coins. A thousand taels of promised gold cannot match a single *hu* of grain. To await the reign of a king for a hundred generations is not as noble as the worth of a full meal.

It is like gambling: the first to play holds the advantage, and the one who moves first wins. There is no lingering debt, for to linger in debt is to become a burden to oneself. Carrying shame and debt, one hires out labor to repay it, yet misfortune in the fields leads to ruin. The debt is passed to one’s children, who live in perpetual want, pledging their lives to repay it, casting themselves into the realm of death. Men are debased, women abased; none regard them with favor. The debt of gambling reaches such extremes.

Why is this so? The first to play in gambling is like one who truly attains the Dao; the one who lingers in debt is like one who falls into the Three Wretched Realms. Thus, the perfected person practices the Dao early and now reaps the fruit of the Eight Liberations, ever abiding in joy and non-action, their virtue measureless.

Why is this? It is like planting: those who sow early reap early, those who sow in season reap in season, and those who sow late reap late. Those who do not sow have nothing to harvest. If calamity strikes, there is nothing to gather, and only when the master bestows alms does one receive. To expect fruit without cultivation is just the same.

Why is this so?

Just as one burdened for a hundred years cannot cast off the load in an instant, nor can one imprisoned for a decade escape confinement at will. To gaze longingly at the sweetness of ten years ahead is to be deluded by the moment; to demand immediate fulfillment is to seek what cannot yet be attained. Thus, the perfected person, knowing the folly of distant longing, cuts off longing and thereby attains it; recognizing the emptiness of unripened fruit, forsakes the fruit and thus gains it.

Why is this so? It is like tending fields: those who rely on heaven’s rain may not see their wishes fulfilled, but those who first dig channels and weirs, guiding the water to irrigate, will surely reap a harvest. Heaven is not without rain, yet scorching sun may still bring ruin, famine, and hardship, cutting short one’s days. The end of the kalpa is not without the Dao, yet the Three Wretched Realms may still prove inescapable.

Therefore, the perfected person, fearing this, seeks the Dao early. Once their truth is exalted, they know no defeat or sorrow, ever abiding in non-action. They act through the non-action of action, entrust themselves to the non-entrustment of entrustment, lodge in the non-lodging of lodging, dwell in the thoughtless thought, and reside in the unattached attachment. Thus, the sage values the first endeavor and honors the initial work.

Why is this so? To honor the first endeavor is to esteem the scholar’s learning. The Three Primes and Nine Calamities bring misfortunes that cannot be avoided, yet those who humble their hearts and cultivate the Dao universally escape them. Thus, the sage values the first endeavor and honors the initial work. All who aspire to the Dao must begin with the initial work.

The initial work is the cause of transgression; the first endeavor is the merit of prior action. Therefore, merit is valued and work is esteemed. Those who neither value nor esteem are no different from the six kinds of livestock. Why is this so? The six kinds of livestock know nothing of the Dao, nor do they comprehend the subtle principle of merit and work—thus they are no different from livestock.

The disciple said: I receive your grace. I humbly seek further explanation.

Scholars in the world receive their masters’ teachings and cultivate the Way and virtue, yet some labor for kalpas without attainment, while others, though not necessarily practicing for many years, ascend to the office of the Great Perfection and Non-Action—why is this?

It is answered: For scholars who cultivate the Dao, the essence lies in comprehending the principle. Those who spend many years without success do so because their minds fail to grasp the principle. It is like a lame man attempting a journey of ten thousand li: though he walks daily, he covers no more than ten li, and only after three years does he reach his destination. Another man, setting out from the same place and bound for the same destination, travels swiftly—covering three hundred li a day—and arrives within a month. The scholar whose mind comprehends the principle is likewise: like one who strides as if flying, none can overtake him. Why? One rides a dragon, the other walks on foot—how can they keep pace? Though their destinations are the same, their speeds differ; though scholars aspire to the Dao, their capacities are not equal.

Some embody the Dao’s teachings yet harbor attachments in their hearts; some feign authenticity while secretly practicing deceit, recklessly divulging esoteric essentials; some speak as if they were perfected beings yet harbor base intentions; some recite sacred texts with their lips while their minds wander; some occupy high positions in learning yet remain deluded by greed for wealth and sensuality; some falsely assume grandeur, overawing the foolish with pomp.

Such scholars are bound for the Three Wicked Realms—where then is the Dao for them? Those who have not yet matured in their understanding may follow such companions, yet though they traverse the world, they are but walking corpses in a prison of their own making.

How can all scholars be equated with these? Consider this analogy: when one sets forth an idea, ten debate it; when one raises a challenge, ten aim their arrows at it. Some may hit the mark once or twice, others two or three times—yet is their intent not the same? Only their perceptions differ. Those who comprehend and those who do not are likewise divided.

The debater says: "I am indebted." Yet further questions remain. I observe in the world five or ten who leave home together, each following their inclination to serve a master, cultivating virtue and the Dao without cease, day or night. The disciples of one master all attain the fruit of the Five Penetrations, while the disciples of another master gain no distinct awakening. If measured by years, their time is the same; if measured by diligence, their labor is equal—yet the disciples of one master advance alone, while those of another do not. The answer lies in the master’s clarity or obscurity, hence the difference in progress.

Why is this so? The master is the gateway to the Dao. If the master is enlightened, deeply versed in scriptural meaning, discerning the profound mysteries of the present age, and able to distinguish the subtle tendencies of the Dao; if they instruct in rituals and prostrations, admonish in accordance with the Dharma, expound the texts to guide disciples into the Dharma assembly, restrain them with propriety, honor them with discipline, and daily impart increasing teachings—then though their forms may differ in appearance, whether near or far, their understanding becomes clear. Filled with reverent awe for the divine, ever fearful of straying from the path, they remain diligent day and night, steadfast and unwavering. Their qi harmonizes, their spirit softens, their form and soul rejoice, and the radiance of the spirit guides them, ushering them into the true Dao. They diligently serve the Three Perfected, invoking profound responses, spreading teachings to turn back the shadows, fiercely pursuing and adhering to the path. With the urging of the Three Masters, they refine and elevate their spirit. The fruit of the Five Penetrations is attained through merit, and in the future, they will surely receive the wondrous reward of the formless Dao.

Why is this so? The enlightened master is the bridge to all paths. It is like entering the sea to gather treasures: one must first know the method of presenting one’s name and credentials, secure the ship with iron, lower the anchor, furl the sails, and set the rudder toward the treasure’s location. One must moor the floating vessel, then deploy sand-stone cannons, set up furnaces, and smelt the ore—whether much or little, coming and going without stumbling. Following an enlightened master is just the same.

Why is this so?

Just as within myriad layers of perilous terrain lie golden elixirs, soft lapis, and the Eight Sacred Fungi—should one advance to gather and ingest them, their lifespan would align with Heaven and Earth, never meeting untimely demise—yet though all who hear of this yearn to set forth, each seeks to traverse and partake, the hazards and obstructions leave them stranded, unable to proceed, with none but turning back. So too are the followers of unenlightened masters. Soft lapis is not absent, yet the peril lies in stagnation and failure to reach it; the void does not lack truth, yet the danger is in aimlessness and lack of direction.

Why is this so? It is like crossing waters in a leaking boat—once filled, it must sink. Adrift upon vast, rushing currents, midstream it must founder. To seek the Eight Sacred Fungi amid towering perils is to surely retreat. To enter the sea in search of treasures without presenting one’s name and credentials is to capsize the vessel. So too is it with master and disciple lacking virtue.

Thus the perfected one never takes themselves as master, and so becomes a master; never deems themselves enlightened, and so attains enlightenment; never claims selfhood, and so fulfills the self; never presumes wisdom, and so achieves wisdom; never asserts vision, and so gains true sight; never exalts themselves, and so rises in stature; never claims virtue, and so embodies virtue; never seeks prominence, and so becomes renowned; never asserts their use, and so proves useful; never assumes authority, and so gains true authority; never presumes greatness, and so becomes great; never boasts of beauty, and so achieves beauty; never declares their authenticity, and so becomes authentic. These thirteen, the perfected one does not adopt.

The method of the scholar demands a skilled interpreter—pondering conduct and practice, one must not undertake what is not yet fitting, lest later it become a calamity; one must not act as artisan before mastery, lest later it harm the hand. Thus the perfected one does not pursue fame, yet their fame becomes manifest; does not prize reputation, yet their reputation spreads far.

Therefore, the Daoist devotees themselves to the Dao, diligently cultivates virtue, entrusts themselves to worthy disciples, follows enlightened masters, expounds the precepts of transformation, recites the scriptures, practices immortal qi, observes fasting and integrity, contemplates the divine, restrains verbal transgressions, binds the five hearts, dissolves the six emotions, turns from the yin thief, faces the Gate of Life, enacts great compassion, cherishes all beings, pities the orphaned and aged, and takes pity on the cold and poor. Such are the supreme practices of the scholar, the fertile field of the worthy—without the binding precepts of an enlightened master, how could one attain this?

Thus the enlightened master is the gateway to the Dao.

Why is this so? When the master is enlightened, the teachings flourish; when the master is benighted, the teachings fail. Hence, the disciples of one master attain the fruit of the Five Penetrations, while the disciples of another remain without awakening or response.

The discerning one says: I receive this grace. I wish to hear the remainder of your explanation.

Does the scholar who abstains from grains and ingests medicinal herbs attain the Dao?
The answer: Yes.
Further asked: How does this compare to perpetual fasting?
Answered: It is not its equal.
Further asked: How does perpetual fasting compare to scripture recitation?
Answered: It is not its equal.
Further asked: How does scripture recitation compare to seated contemplation?
Answered: It is not its equal.

Why is this so?
Those who abandon grains rely solely on medicinal herbs; when the qi of the herbs is abundant and full, they may endure for a thousand years before their term ends, only to be reborn anew—no different from a beginner in the end.

Those who practice perpetual fasting tally their merit daily; when merit reaches ten thousand, they ascend to the Great Void, transcending the Four Paths. With a single fast of rectitude, when merit is complete and virtue perfected, they attain the Dao of Non-Action and Supreme Perfection.

The fruit of perpetual fasting is beyond conception, and so too is that of the scripture-reciting scholar—beyond conception.

Why is this so?
The scripture-reading scholar counts each character as merit; with three thousand merits, their name is inscribed in the Registers of Upper Clarity—how much more so for those who broadly peruse the scrolls and long hold the scriptures?

Why is this so?
The scriptures are the teachings of the Dao; to read and practice accordingly is to face the Dao’s own command. Thus, the scriptures weave the destinies of all beings, dispelling the calamity of greed and desire. When this calamity is removed, afflictions and disasters vanish; when disasters vanish, the Five Poisons diminish; when all evils dissolve, the myriad virtues converge. Then, transcending the host of immortals, one attains the supreme fruit.

Therefore, the perfected treasure the scriptures and cherish them, loving them as they would wife and child. The Ten Immortals arise from this, for the scriptures stand foremost among the practices of Non-Action.

The scholar’s pursuit of the Dao is likewise beyond conception.

Why is this so?
"Contemplation" speaks of mindfulness; "mindfulness" speaks of stability; "stability" speaks of immovability. To be immovable is to employ the power of the Ten Immortals.

Why is this so?
By closing the gates of distraction, one severs wayward thoughts and abandons improper intentions. When the spirit is settled and the will unshakable, the perfected, through cultivation, attain stability; through scripture study, they attain rectitude; through fasting, they attain endurance. Persisting without deviation, they perfect the Supreme Perfection.

Though but a moment’s departure is avoided, when merit is complete, they become guests of the Highest Realm, roaming the Purple Gold Precincts, ever joyful and assured of their destiny.

All the countless multitudes cultivate the causes of the Three Actions; when merit gathers across the Ten Directions, they ascend as towering Supreme Immortals.

You must practice thus, and excel as they have: beneath your feet, lotus blossoms arise, and your marks of excellence remain ever natural.

The discerning one says: I receive this grace. I wish to hear the remainder of your explanation.

As the Heavenly Worthy has declared, the merit of the Three Actions is boundless—equal in discourse to the Ten Immortals, beyond thought, beyond measure. Yet I wonder: do other actions also bear retribution?

The answer: They do.

If a scholar, though not cultivating the Three Actions, broadly constructs temples and monasteries, offering all manner of supplies in almsgiving, what retribution shall he receive?

The answer: He shall naturally receive the retribution of heaven.

And once this retribution is received, where shall he dwell?

He shall dwell in the dwelling of impermanence, abide in the abode of impermanence. Why? If, while within this retribution, he cultivates the Three Actions, his discourse shall equal that of the highest Dao, and he shall attain the supreme fruit. But if, within this retribution, he does not cultivate the Three Actions, he shall descend among men and birds, or fall into the Three Wretched Realms. Thus he dwells in the dwelling of impermanence, abides in the abode of impermanence.

If one refrains from creating the Four Actions and instead focuses solely on altar rites and almsgiving, what retribution shall he receive?

The answer: He shall receive the retribution of the Heavenly Kitchens and Earthly Treasuries.

And when this retribution is exhausted, where shall he dwell, and what shall be his station?

The answer: He shall likewise have no permanent abode. Why? If, within this retribution, he cultivates the Three Actions, his fruit shall be supreme. If not, he shall fall according to his karma—thus he has no permanent abode.

If a person of resolve does not cultivate the Five Actions but devotes himself entirely to the transformation of the Dao, neglecting worldly affairs, what retribution shall he receive?

The answer: The Four Paths are difficult to ascend; he shall gradually cultivate stability. Why? Such a one is a householder of the Dao. If, within his retribution, he cultivates the Three Actions, his merit shall surpass that of the Three Actions, ascending to the benefits of progress, and below, he shall rank with the advancing immortals.

Thus the perfected ones broadly establish fields of merit, and none fail to bear fruit. Why? The perfected ones plant all seeds of action, and thus receive all seeds of retribution; they embody all seeds of compassion, and thus embody all seeds of love.

By constructing temples and monasteries, they now receive palaces and halls;
By performing altar rites and almsgiving, they now receive the heavenly kitchens’ feasts;
By transforming others through the Dao, they now attain unobstructed wisdom;
By abstaining from the five pungent roots, they now attain a pure body;
By forsaking rich and fatty foods, they now attain a form of non-action;
By revering prostration, they now attain the highest honor;
By cherishing non-killing, they now attain long life and longevity;
By praising goodness, they now attain a thousandfold voice;
By practicing forbearance, they now attain a wondrously beautiful form;
By avoiding slander and insult, they now attain the love and respect of all;
By constantly aiding and saving beings, they now attain freedom from illness;
By harboring no love or hatred in the heart, they now attain equanimous wisdom;
By using medicine to relieve the suffering of beings, they now attain a divine and efficacious tongue;
By adorning the Dharma, they now attain a body of purple gold;
By refraining from false speech, they now attain a lotus tongue;
By never severing the Way, they now attain all marks of excellence.

All that is unattainable arises from prior cultivation. The perfected ones act thus, transcending the realm of the Supreme Ones. You too must act thus—even what came before is not sufficient.

When merit gathers and conditions converge, aeons pass like lightning. Roaming beyond the Great Veil, they sit and behold the great thousandfold worlds, as if a hair’s breadth were a pearl in the palm—when the pearl departs, its luster remains.

Such are these virtues and deeds, all led forth by the ten thousand practices. If even one good is not fully cultivated, the Ten Immortals ascend the high ridge. Without shrinking from toil and hardship, they universally assemble in the realm of the Supreme Perfected.

The discerning one says: I receive this grace. I wish to ask what remains unresolved.

As the Heavenly Worthy has declared, the multitudes of the ten directions—numberless as the sands of the Ganges—all arise from the three karmic actions. Yet how do kings and feudal lords cultivate their karma to become revered among men? Their fathers pass, and their sons succeed them—why is this so? If we reckon by causes and conditions, there is no succession; if by kindred lineage, there are breaks and ruptures. Such discrepancies give rise to endless doubt. We only pray the Heavenly Worthy will reveal the origins of these causes and conditions.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Excellent question! The reason kings and feudal lords inherit their domains through generations is that their prior karma has accumulated, and they share in its blessings together.

The questioner asked: Then why do these lineages sometimes break? If those with blessings share in them together, their surnames and heirs should endure without end. If not, there would be no causes and conditions at all.

The Heavenly Worthy answered: All ranks, whether noble or base, have their own karmic grades. If their prior karma is the same, they share the same blessings and receive their nature accordingly. Why is this? Consider the farmer who tills the field: he plants according to the seed, and the seed grows according to its kind. If he changes the seed, the crop changes as well. Thus, a single plot of land may yield a hundred different harvests—how much more so the rise and fall of a feudal domain?

The discerning one said: I receive this grace. I wish to ask further questions. The principles the Heavenly Worthy has expounded are unheard of in this world. Since the revelation of the original form, how many aeons have passed? How many beings have been delivered? Are they delivered because of karmic affinity, or regardless of it? We only pray the Heavenly Worthy will reveal the origins of these causes and conditions.

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Excellent, excellent! Since the revelation of the wondrous original form, which I have received and upheld, countless aeons—numberless as the sands of the Ganges—have passed. The beings I have delivered are measureless and boundless, beyond reckoning or description. They arise and perish with the turning of the cosmic kalpas, like the records of the sea’s waters—unknown to all. The great sages who have attained the Dao before the radiant kings of sun and moon are also numberless as the sands of the Ganges, and all have studied the original form to achieve the Way. Thus, the original form is the primal sovereign of all scriptures, turning the wheel of the Dao in ways beyond thought or imagination.

Upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse, all present gained understanding together and rejoiced greatly. They rose to perform the threefold bow, then knelt and prostrated themselves before the Heavenly Worthy, reciting these verses:

A thousand aeons’ karmic convergence,
Destiny births this transient form.
I encountered the Supreme Worthy,
Who expounded the scripture of utmost truth.

Every question finds its answer,
For the Dao arises from the three karmic actions.
All good rests in impermanence,
Its flow unceasing, never still.

Disciples serve the luminous spirit,
The Dharma’s teachings grow ever clearer.
Pointing to the traces of non-action,
The fruit attains the name of the Ten Immortals.

Master and disciple, both benighted,
Through ten thousand aeons, no refinement—
Like the blind traversing myriad dangers,
Sure to plunge into the great abyss.

One master, a host of great sages,
All transcend through the scripture of utmost truth.
Now, all who have come here
Must practice the ten thousand virtues,
Unshaken even by kings and lords,
None but submit with sincere devotion.

Wealth and rank are but bubbles on water,
Not worth trading for true glory.
The golden-purple body of the attained Dao
Is originally empty, perfected through non-action.

All, whether noble or base,
Find right and wrong in the sincerity of the heart.

*Scroll Two of the Heavenly Worthy’s Wondrous Dharma Scripture of the Original Form*

In general discourse...

The Dao shapes heaven and earth, its virtue exalts the myriad things, nurturing without end, its merit filling the harmonious qi. The hundred beasts and divine insects, knowing from whence they are born, still cling to their kin, harboring no harmful thoughts—how much more should those who aspire to transcendence hold such devotion! Yet the heterodox fail to honor this, falling short even of the hearts of beasts and insects.

Earth and wood may be moved, but the heterodox remain unmoved. When the mind departs and the body follows, spirit and form come to rest, yet their perceptions diverge, and so spirit and form drift apart, dwelling in separation. Those who cultivate the Dao exert body and mind in unison, arriving at the same end. Without delusion or distraction, steadfast and unmoving—even if heaven rains flying stones, fire arises to scorch the earth, or the earth spews forth yellow springs in boiling surges—they never waver for even a moment. Such is the resolve of those who esteem the Dao’s work.

Delighting in dwelling on Mount Lao, though three thousand heavenly demons assail them—hurling mountains, striking with hammers, casting rocks in wild disarray, shattering trees, collapsing cliffs into countless fragments like swirling snow—they remain unharmed, their form unaltered, their joy undisturbed, their focus unchanged. Then come hundreds of blazing torches, vying to terrify, scorching the forests until no sapling or fruit remains, their flames surging and receding like the sea. Yet the adept’s will remains serene, their heart at ease, untroubled and unshaken. Their resolve cannot be undone, their clarity ever brightening. Unburdened by fear or dread, their Dao-mind remains as before, drawing from non-action.

This unspoken teaching is for my disciples alone; this unnamed instruction, for my heirs. Why? Because to speak not, to name not, is to embody emptiness and nothingness. Those who walk this path awaken the Dao-mind alone, beyond the reach of the worldly and common—they descend from the heavens above.

The heterodox invert truth, teaching from the solid, leading their followers astray, and many plunge into fire. How much less can they grasp emptiness and nothingness! Those who do are my true seed. Without such seed, without such heirs, how could one know emptiness and nothingness as the master? Why? The Dao shapes heaven and earth yet does not claim me as father; its virtue exalts the myriad things yet does not claim me as mother—how then could one alone know the source of emptiness and nothingness?

Thus the perfected ones, knowing emptiness is worthy of honor, practice emptiness and attain emptiness; knowing nothingness is to be relied upon, cultivate nothingness and attain nothingness. Those who understand the nameless and unspoken know how heavenly beings descend to transform the world. Embracing the Dao in action, carrying yin in conduct, relying on emptiness for benefit, and through nothingness achieving merit.

All that bears qi arises from they know not what—some call it spontaneity, others causation. Whether in suffering or joy, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, all speak thus. Those who truly know spontaneity do not believe in spontaneity; those who truly know causation do not believe in causation. It is like a child learning speech: they know how to imitate but not the meaning, know how to study but not the principle.

Thus I study the teachings of the Father, proclaiming them to all directions. Diligent yet unwearied, laboring without seeking merit, ever withdrawing once the work is done to fulfill the heavenly Dao—thus I abandon that and take this. The Dao, though strong, may break like a branch; virtue, though weak, melts like snow. By embracing harmony, one governs above and below. Thus the high are humbled, the low are raised—this is how the Dao is applied. If rigid, one perishes; if unyielding, one breaks. Only by avoiding both can one endure. If rigid and unyielding, the body has no support—where then is the Dao?

Thus the Daoist embraces harmony, rejects rigidity and strength, humbles the high and raises the low. The nature of water nurtures the body, suffusing the Jade Palace, ever free from harm. Thus the perfected ones have no illness, for they take the people’s suffering as their own—this is called "illness as illness." Without sorrow or distress, what illness do I have?

Strength and aggression are the root of death; harmony and gentleness, the root of life. How do we know this? Tigers, though strong, are trapped in pits; trees, though strong, are felled by fire. Are pits not to be feared? Yet those who dwell in them as friends bring ruin upon themselves. Does fire not arise from wood? Yet those who ceaselessly drill bring flames upon themselves. Thus the perfected ones break their strength and aggression, preserving harmony and gentleness. Therefore, the rigid and strong are companions of death; the soft and weak, companions of life.

Thus the Daoist values the way of life, prizing steadfastness. The demonic and worldly value strength and aggression, prizing stubborn attachment. Thus the true and the common differ in their pursuits, seeking distinct benefits. Though their efforts may be the same, their rewards are inverted.

The progenitor of life, the progenitor of cause—who is closer? The progenitor of life is the qi of heaven: follow it and qi harmonizes; oppose it and qi disorders. Thus the father is one with heaven, the mother one with earth. To oppose father and mother is to oppose heaven and earth. Yet one honors the progenitor of life, reveres the parents of cause—even loving a wife, one thus honors them.

Thus the perfected ones abandon attachment and so attain perfection; they honor the progenitor of life and so attain the Dao. Though the world differs in its views, all people are the same, born from heavenly qi and nurtured by earthly qi. Yet none recognize the weight of their origin, the grace of heaven and earth—all fall short of the beasts, insects, and divine creatures who know the Dao.

Lascivious women gather in throngs, eagerly seeking to seduce men. If one delights in dwelling among them, they engage in debauchery; if one remains unwilling, their resolve firm as a eunuch’s, unmoved and unshaken—what benefit can such seduction bring? The danger lies in seeing lust through lust—how can lust be restrained? Applying lust to a eunuch—what desire remains to covet?

Thus the sage’s heart wanders like an empty bird, their emotions severed like a eunuch’s. Even entering a land of lust, how could they be stained? The lascivious women are not without desire, but I do not share it—what benefit is their desire to me? Only when two lusts meet does desire arise.

Thus the Perfected One often passes through the abodes of lascivious women, and the women, repentant and awakened, do not impose their desires but instead sever them entirely. Therefore, upon seeing beauty, he likens it to earth and wood; upon seeing treasure, he casts it aside as tiles and pebbles. Why? Because coveting treasure with treasure only stirs greater greed, and delighting in lust with lust only multiplies desire. When the great karmic bond nears its end, where do treasure and beauty reside? Only through restraint and severance is the Dao accomplished without fail—only those with wisdom can ponder this.

From the One arise the myriad things, the root of the Four Great Elements, yet people remain unaware. Yang generates and yin nurtures, yet none believe it. Heaven covers and earth bears, yet living beings do not recognize it. Sun and moon shine brightly, yet the ten thousand kinds do not comprehend. Manifest proofs and clear evidence are met with disbelief in the divine. They resign themselves to fate and death, not cultivating karmic conditions, clinging to partial views and divergent paths, treasuring their fathers as if they were jewels.

Thus the Perfected One practices the One and embraces virtue to nurture the Four Great Elements. When merit is complete and affairs are accomplished, he attains the reward of purple gold. Therefore, the wise recognize this: first cultivate karmic conditions to nourish spirit and form, neither abandoning nor discarding, preserving wholeness as ever. Thus they know the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generate the myriad things—thereby heaven and earth endure forever, arising from this principle. Hence they constantly treasure and practice it.

Those who do not know the One are ranked with the six livestock. The six livestock know not the One, nor whence karmic conditions arise—thus they are equated with the six livestock. The Dao is square yet does not sever; it responds universally to all. Virtue is round yet does not lack; it manifests through merit and resonates to completion.

Should it sever, there arises the peril of deficiency and loss; should it lack, there emerges the flaw of exhaustion and abandonment. Thus, it neither severs nor lacks, remaining serene and unharmed. Why is this so? Where there is intent, there is response; where there is merit, there is resonance. Flowing and suffusing the ten thousand directions, it bends to enter the chamber of reality.

Thus, it is neither broad nor extravagant, yet can respond to breadth and extravagance; neither expansive nor narrow, yet can respond to expansion and narrowness; neither beautiful nor ugly, yet can respond to beauty and ugliness; neither sinful nor blessed, yet can respond to sin and blessing. Therefore, it is beyond thought or conjecture, an empty and effortless craftsmanship, its forms filling the ten thousand kinds.

If one seeks to explain it in words, no rhetoric can clarify; if one seeks to measure it, no great power can fathom. It is like the spirit of the valley, responding in accordance with size and shape. The transformative responses of the Dao are likewise.

The good person is like water, benefiting all things, their merit flowing like a current, all receiving its moisture. Thus, the Dao is the treasure of softness and weakness, and virtue is the treasure of warp and weft. Therefore, the perfected person constantly treasures the Dao and ever cherishes virtue, holding fast without wavering—this is the task of the perfected person!

Stone and water harmonize to exist, while the Brahmin child and the Dao are named in transformation. Though their names may be the same, the principles of their use differ. Thus, though water and stone share the same realm, the benefits they receive are unequal.

Therefore, the perfected person treasures the Dao and cherishes virtue, valuing them more than the benefits of water. Throughout the day, they do not depart from their provisions, regarding them as their left and right hands, wielding them as if before their eyes, grasping them as if in awe. Day and night, they strive ceaselessly, ever feeling insufficient—thus they attain perfection.

When the world possesses the Dao, the true Dharma flourishes; when the world lacks the Dao, the true Dharma declines.

Why is this so? When the world fails to honor the Dao, true qi departs and scatters—thus the true Dharma declines. Yet this is not something a ruler can abolish; rather, when the mandate nears its end, delusion arises in the heart and the Dharma is forsaken. If it flourishes, this too is not something a ruler can bring about; rather, boundless fortune unfolds.

Thus, when King Yeya was ensnared by the filth of sensual attachment, Purple Yang was poised to respond; when the wondrous Brahmin arose from the sincerity of his vows, the age to come would face the ordeal of suffering’s deliverance. All these are the creations of past karma manifesting in the present body. What is cultivated in this life becomes the provision for the next; what was sown in former lives now shapes the body’s radiance.

Therefore, even emperors and kings cannot summon or suppress it. If governance aligns with the proper use of things, and one draws from this in the present, will they not meet their fate anew? They are no different from King Yeya. Emerging into life and sinking into death, never lingering in one place, they revolve through the five destinies, reborn according to their inclinations. By the reckoning of karma, they receive birth—not falsely granted glory, nor falsely imposed suffering. Heaven observes, earth awaits, and the overseer of pure spirits examines each soul, not losing even the slightest fraction. It is like the teeth of a millstone grinding every edge—none escapes its grasp. If one seeks to receive what is not to be received, the outcome is the same.

Why is this so? It is like building a wall—every plank must be tamped; if even one plank is left untamped, the wall cannot stand. Thus, the sage, fearing that transgressions cannot be avoided, diligently cultivates the Dao and its practices, setting their mind on purity and truth. Unbound by worldly customs, they do not pursue royal affairs. Through such diligence, they escape the suffering of bondage.

Those who possess resolve and discernment share companionship with the heavenly beings, untouched by demonic afflictions or wayward entanglements. Why is this so? Because of their resolve and discernment. Without resolve or discernment, they share companionship with the six livestock. Why is this? The six livestock know only their mother and do not recognize their father—thus, those without resolve or discernment are no different from beasts.

Lofty yet without a peak, low yet without a base, expansive yet without bounds, inexhaustible when pressed, immeasurable in extent, unfathomable in scope. Vast and self-governing, merging and self-acting, it responds to the myriad forms, its merit perfected across the ten directions. It nurtures all that has form, its compassion extending to all beings.

Why is this so? If there were no such response, who could comprehend its teachings? Thus, it arises in response.

To cultivate this responsive teaching with a mind so single-mindedly bound that it cannot be undone—does this not also join one with the assembly of the supreme? Thus, the perfected person practices the methods of responsive transformation to attain non-action.

If one knows that responsive transformation is worthy of emulation and diligently practices it, one also shares companionship with the perfected. Why is this so? The true nature is formless, born from emptiness and nothingness, neither color nor image, its wondrous qi naturally arising. How could it be cut or divided to respond? It divides yet does not diminish, spreads yet does not exhaust, serene and subtle without reliance—thus, it coalesces qi into form and extends relief to the myriad forms.

Its great passing has no summit, its use inexhaustible; its great return has no depth, its use unbounded. It accomplishes yet does not dwell; ever withdrawing the self. It shapes as a vessel yet does not claim it; ever casting off names. This is the supreme teaching of the true and correct, the essential principle of non-action. To accomplish yet not abide—this is the Dao of Heaven. To craft as a vessel yet claim nothing—this is the model of the perfected. Without merit, without name, how could transformation be delayed? Thus, the perfected abides in the teaching without name, diligent in the work without toil, and so accomplishes it.

Why is this so? If one clings to name, merit cannot be established; if one clings to merit, then it becomes a bestowal. Thus, the perfected knows action but not its name, knows diligence but not its toil. Therefore, bestowing without expecting reward, the fruit naturally ripens. The waters flowing to the sea do not long for return, yet they cycle back of themselves—the response of the great passing is likewise. Thus, one knows action and knows diligence.

Building a chamber with doors and windows, kindling light to cast its glow—if one aligns with the wondrous chamber yet no light enters, where is the brightness? Without light, the craftsman has nothing to fashion; without doors and windows, brightness has nothing to illuminate. If sentient beings lack the nature of the Dao, the craftsman has nothing to work upon. Because sentient beings possess the principle of reflection, models are established to teach them. If one gazes into a chamber at night, nothing can be discerned—only when light is cast can work proceed.

Thus, the perfected, receiving the instruction of the three masters, becomes perfected. Why is this so? A chamber without doors and windows is no different from having no chamber; a body without a teacher’s instruction is no different from having no body. Therefore, the perfected abandons attachment to cultivate the Dao and so becomes true; leaving the household to practice learning, one becomes virtuous.

Thus, Yu Luoqiao valued the Dao and esteemed virtue, attaining the station of non-action! Gold and jade piled like mountains, coins and silks spread like plains—without preserving the Dao or aspiring to truth, what is the use? They vanish like the setting sun, their blessings exhausted, with nothing to rely upon, nothing to depend on. Birdlime smeared on dung is not esteemed; dung beetles rolling their balls hold nothing precious. Thus, treasures cannot be prized, coins and silks are not worthy of esteem.

Therefore, the perfected values the Dao and scorns treasure, esteems virtue and discards wealth, ultimately attaining the station of the Great Perfected. Why is this so? Treasures amassed become gates of misfortune; wealth gathered invites thieves. Thus, the person of the Dao diligently cultivates the Dao, not treasures; practices virtue, not wealth. Even if coins were piled to the heavens, it would not compare to sitting and advancing in this Dao—thus, one does not pursue treasure or wealth.

The Dao gives birth to the myriad things yet does not claim mastery; virtue nurtures all beings yet does not count it as toil. Thus, the Dao abides above yet is not burdensome, and the people do not grow weary. Without the Dao, wealth does not long endure. Why is this so? People cannot depart from the Dao, just as fish cannot leave water. People who abandon the Dao perish; fish who leave water die. Thus, the perfected embraces the Dao and holds fast to virtue, and so attains enduring life.

Enduring life means abiding in serenity without change, dwelling in the task of non-action. Thus is the Dao of long life and enduring vision—enduring vision means that when heaven and earth crumble, a thousand ashes scatter, the myriad things all perish, yet the self alone endures. Witnessing the dissolution of heaven and earth, the spirit remains serene—this is the Dao of enduring vision and long life.

The nature of an unborn infant is without desire; the radiance of a pearl within an oyster lies hidden within. Why is this so? The infant’s nature perceives nothing externally, distinguishes nothing internally—it cries for milk when hungry, ceases when full. Even if left unfed for a long time, it wails all day without hoarseness. Why? Because its harmony is perfect, without restlessness or vexation, thus it can give rise to goodness.

The bright pearl within the oyster, when released, becomes a pearl; if never released, it remains within the clam. The only danger is growing large, being seized by passions and desires—its poison cannot be broken. Thus, the perfected, following non-desire, completes the true Dao, arising at the age of seven to uphold virtue and so perfecting the self. Why is this so? Desire is the root of the five poisons; thought is the source of bodily harm—thus, one abandons them, daring to follow what one dares not indulge.

The guest of impermanence cannot be entertained; the views of external paths must be abandoned and not returned to. If one awakens to them, it is swifter than the ordinary person—one may reach the station of earthly immortality in an instant. Why is this so? The stain of heterodox learning enters, the qi of empty wisdom spreads, the virtue of past blessings is received—yet seeing a slight misstep, one is transformed into heterodoxy. Thus, past attachments lead to swift awakening.

The guest of impermanence and the views of external paths alike delude the mind without change, departing and not returning. One must strictly adhere to practice, not clinging to loyalty or sincerity, drifting east and west with the wind, blown away entirely. Why is this so? Lacquer’s nature favors blackness—it takes on color as it is dyed, not adhering to one hue but staining as it is tainted. Thus, the inconstant cannot be governed by the Dao; the views of external paths cannot be repented. Each clings to their own inclination, not following the true teaching.

Thus, the true person’s resolve stands firm as Kunlun, unshaken and immovable—though the forest’s trees grow tall, they never shed their leaves. Therefore, the true person binds the knot that cannot be knotted, yet remains inextricable; fastens the gate that cannot be gated, yet remains unopenable. Never swept away by the wind, they thus attain truth.

Clay is made from earth, yet without water it cannot take form; vessels are shaped from clay, yet without evenness they cannot be leveled. Thus, water is the origin of harmony and evenness, and evenness the root of balance and refinement. When the craftsman applies skill, the vessel gains the name of pottery; without application, the clay remains unharmonized, and without leveling, the shaping fails. Thus, earth, water, evenness, and craftsmanship support and uphold one another, and only then is the clay placed upon the wheel. Fire tends the kiln, smoke marks the hue; when sealed and cooled, the vessel is revealed—such is the work of pottery.

Why is this so? Earth is the cause of the vessel, water its condition. The shaping of clay forms its limbs, evenness spreads its pattern like teachings. The craftsman is the world’s model, fire and heat concentrate the true qi. The vessel’s use exalts non-action; virtue arises from the slightest thread, swelling into rivers, seas, and mountains.

The true person, following this path, now attains the supreme guest; all ordinary beings’ blessings, when tread upon, become the ten immortals. The virtue of the sea is inconceivable, its power shaking the great thousand worlds. Such is the Way—divine, boundless, and immeasurable.

To abandon learning is to stray into perversity; to refuse learning is to be like the blind. The Way arises from this, yet without understanding, one grasps not the truth of Daoist study. Wandering like livestock, the right mindfulness clings to greed and diligence. The mouth profits from the six livestock, the hands tie them with halters. Stealing the world’s goods, one builds a household and fields, unaware of the debt owed in darkness—the cause of hell’s blade-winds. Without tasting the poison’s bitterness, one seeks to repay it, calling to children and grandchildren. Again and again, they are pulled along, their fortune exhausted until no smoke rises from the hearth.

If one can cast off all attachments and delight in the true scriptures, perversity severs itself, and no defilements draw near. Without learning, one is utterly blind, unable to distinguish good from evil, new from old. The six livestock know not learning, hence the saying: "like the new." Cease striving, sever all records, and abide ever in spontaneity. The benefits are inconceivable—ten thousand kalpas pass like a lightning flash. Such is the power of the Way and virtue; only the wise persist.

At first, it may seem insignificant, yet virtue manifests, revealing the profound mystery. The merit of non-action is perfected, and one becomes a master of the three realms. Only through cultivation without weariness may one enter the gate of eternal joy.

Beauty and ugliness—who can say which is greater? Flattery and integrity—how much do they weigh? Thus, the noble person despises flattery and ultimately gains the name of noble conduct. Yet noble conduct is neither granted by heaven nor bestowed by earth; it arises from holding loyalty and repaying deeds, from words of trust and evident goodness, unadorned and unembellished.

When an upright person follows others, they gain a name but bear no fruit; when a flatterer follows others, they gain prestige but lack substance. Therefore, the wise abandon the path of the noble and cultivate the Way of non-action.

The Way values humility, while demonic paths exalt loftiness. The human path prizes life, the ghostly path prizes death. The true Way cherishes simplicity, while the human path cherishes ornamentation. Though their names may be the same, their directions differ entirely.

Why is this so? Humility seeks to gather all virtues; when these virtues unite, they become as vast as rivers and seas—hence the value of humility. Demonic paths exalt loftiness, rejecting all virtues, self-taught in their own strengths, unwilling to yield to the goodness of others—thus they are demonic.

The human path exalts perfection, not seeking the life of eternal vision. When illness or suffering arises, they pray to spirits and deities, vainly seeking blessings and fortune. Not aspiring to long life, they are said to prize life. The ghostly path prizes death, valuing annihilation and revering injury—hence it is called the path of prizing death. The true Way values simplicity, not pursuing ornamentation. The rightful concern is for the Way, not for glory—thus, though their concerns may seem alike, their directions differ entirely.

Therefore, the true person humbles themselves, thereby uniting all virtues. Radiant as the sun and moon, lofty as Kunlun, they dwell in lowliness like rivers and seas, which, by occupying the lowest places, become lords of all valleys. Assisting the profound and exalting the virtues of all, the four masters ultimately transmit the Way of numinous wisdom.

Thus, the person of the Way need not regard loftiness nor rely on favor. Therefore, kings and lords call themselves "the orphaned" and "the widowed," humble titles that bring high rank. Thus, the true person abides in lowliness and thereby attains loftiness, receiving the virtues of all virtues and thereby perfecting their own virtue.

Why is this so? A mound without water cannot nurture the hundred grasses; deep but not broad, high but not thick. The silkworm, slender as a hair, eats leaves and spins silk, weaving robes and crowns of five colors, fragrant and splendid—noble and base alike wear them. In lands without mulberry or silkworms, when people see colored silks, they know not their origin. If someone explains that they come from the silkworm’s mouth, woven by a skilled woman, none would disbelieve.

If a master of virtue explains the origin of the Way, their marks of excellence are complete, unmatched among people. Their voice is like thunder, their eyes like the sun’s radiance. Their shoulders slope like a stag’s, their face is level and bright, their hands hang past their knees, their feet tread upon firm ground. Their palms bear ten lines, their forehead three intersecting marks; their ears rise above their hair, their nose has twin pillars, straight and square. Their forty-eight teeth gleam white as frost, their tongue can cover their face, their breath is fragrant as lotus and orchid. Their eyebrows bear eight hues, their white hair-mark shines with light; their topknot spirals like a conch, their crown is adorned with nine auspicious jades. Their head is like a jade hall, their back bears the Dipper’s net, their chest bears the Vermilion Bird, their feet tread upon the dragon’s bed. On their left is blue, on their right white; the six jia spirits attend them, divine beings practice at their side, the nine immortals stand in ranks. Through kalpas they do not decline, through countless ages they do not age. They depart like bending and stretching, their form traverses the four directions. Six kinds of tremors shake the earth, yet they remain serene as the sea’s edge. Such is their awe-inspiring virtue—the king of ten thousand sages.

Arising from study, they transcend the Daoist realm; the ignorant do not believe, startled and bewildered, they clamor in confusion.

In foreign lands, no insects breed, their hearts are solid and unmeasured, what is real is not hollow, only knowledge leads to forgetting. When bandits approach the state, how shall they be repelled? When besieged by a hundred layers, how shall they be broken? It is said: when bandits come, resist them with force, repel them with counsel. Why is this so? Bandits are cowardly by nature—easily withstood. If the enemy is small, one may withdraw the army; by employing counsel to repel, troops need not be sent, and the army may still return. Why? Counsel can subdue evil, fortune can dissolve misfortune. Thus, repel them with counsel, dissolve them with fortune. When besieged by a hundred layers, make the city walls firm, shut the gates and don armor. The bandits will weary and grow disheartened, and soon they will retreat. Therefore, the Perfected One always defends against bandits with arms, and bandits cannot invade; with firm city walls, bandits cannot prevail.

When a state is on the verge of chaos, how shall it be stabilized? When ministers grow weary and plot rebellion, how shall they be pacified? It is said: the people rebel from vexation, ministers rebel from confusion—such is the cause of chaos and rebellion. How shall it be remedied? It is said: abandon greed and desire, govern through non-action to nurture the people. When the common folk are at peace, they will delight in their ruler and state, and chaos will never arise. When all under heaven willingly submit, how could they desire disorder? Thus, there is no chaos.

When ministers plot rebellion, it is because the ruler is confused, and they do not follow the laws. Their conduct is unlawful—this is why they rebel. They must repent their errors, reform the old and cultivate the new, rectify the framework and govern by law. Within, there is no confusion; without, no tyranny. Therefore, the Perfected One always dispels vexation and chaos, and the people are tranquil; always dispels confusion and treachery, and ministers delight in loyalty. When the ruler is clear and ministers are at peace, there is no collapse; when the people delight in harmony, there is lasting security.

Uncarved wood cannot become a vessel; untilled land will never yield soft grain. Why? Uncarved wood will eventually rot and decay; untilled fields will grow thick with thorns. Jackals, wolves, foxes, and owls will dwell within, while horned owls and magpies nest in the woods. Abandoned fields become overgrown with brambles. When scholars abandon the law, it is the same. If wood remains uncarved, it will forever remain dry and brittle. But if it encounters a craftsman, who applies the marking line, the axe, saw, and chisel, and day by day refines it with carving, it will surely achieve its purpose—used, it will serve as desired; tempered, it will suffer no damage.

Thus, the Perfected One wields uncarved wood and employs craftsmen, and so can fashion vessels; cultivates untilled land, and so can harvest grain. Why? Uncarved wood and untilled fields are like the ordinary person; encountering craftsmen and plowing are like the teacher’s instruction; becoming a vessel and reaping grain are like the fruition of practice. Therefore, the Perfected One diligently cultivates and refines, and now attains perfection.

Practice non-action, and each day brings increase; practice action, and each day brings loss. Why? Non-action does not obstruct things, and one knows the benefit of non-action. Those who cling to action are attached to existence, yet all that exists ultimately returns to non-existence. Thus, one knows that action brings daily loss. If one can reduce and reduce again, until reaching non-action, then the Perfected One cultivates non-action and not action, practices increase and not loss, and so can achieve growth.

Dwelling in the Dao, one must walk the upright path; abiding in the law, one must act with truth. Those who do not do so will surely fall into deviance. Therefore, the Perfected One always closes the gate of deviance and opens the path of uprightness. Through this cause and condition, one now attains the position of true perfection. Why? It is like a smith who, regardless of the shape’s size, uses the square and compass to measure all around—nothing fails to conform. Why? If the mold is uniform, the material takes shape according to its kind, never deviating or changing. It transforms and returns to its nature, whether gold or silver, copper or iron. When melted, it manifests according to its kind.

If the teacher practices uprightness, the disciple will also be upright; if the teacher indulges in deviance, the disciple will also be deviant. The transmission between teacher and disciple is just like this. Sand and stone may be hard, but within the mortar, they are ground to powder. Without the craftsman’s hammer, how can they be refined? Blue and white stones, with straight veins and patterns, may become pestles—yet even the most skilled craftsman, without a hammer in hand, how can they be shaped?

Thus, scholars must apply admonition and guidance, following the text to gain understanding. Even if a worthy teacher imparts instruction, without the text, nothing is taught; even if one has fine talent, without a teacher, nothing is learned. Therefore, one is cultivated through texts and guided through admonition.

It is like building a boat—without water, it cannot sail; like felling a tree—without an axe, it cannot be cut; like kindling a fire—without wood, it cannot be lit; like drawing from a deep well—without a rope, it cannot be retrieved. Thus, the Perfected One encounters craftsmen and receives their hammering, and now attains the task of Great Perfection and non-action.

If water is placed in a cauldron but no fire is applied, how can it boil? If grain is placed in a mortar but left unthreshed, how can it be refined? Therefore, all undertakings are accomplished through effort. If one aspires to the flavor of the Dao, one must labor diligently—only then can it be perfected and exalted. Thus, the Perfected One encounters fire and receives threshing, and now attains the fruit of ripeness and maturity. Why? Fortune is never wasted in vain; merit never loses its lesson.

Without grinding and winnowing, the decayed will surely endure; without carving and polishing, the unhewn will surely be discarded. Thus, only the wise can practice this, only they can labor at it—without practice and without diligence, one will never draw near. Water in a cauldron left unheated, grain in a mortar left unthreshed—merely watching without acting, one will never attain one’s desire. The Daoist who abides in the Dharma yet does not practice the Way is likewise.

Though the zither and lute possess refined music, without plucking they do not sound; though bells and drums possess rhythmic tones, without striking they do not resound. Thus, the Perfected One plucks the zither to awaken others, strikes the drum to gather the multitude. Why? By plucking the zither and striking the drum, one allows all beings to hear and know. The zither and drum are like the nature of the Dao; the one who strikes them is like the master’s teaching. If one loves the zither, one comes of one’s own to listen; if one loves the drum, one comes of one’s own to listen. Thus, the Perfected One constantly strikes the drum and plucks the zither, never ceasing day or night. Why? The Perfected One pities beings who do not hear the music, and so strikes it day and night.

If there are beings who delight in the Three Treasures, one should give them the Three Treasures; if there are those who love the zither and lute, one should give them the zither and lute. Why? The zither and lute can awaken beings, and so one gives them. If the Perfected One does not pluck the zither or strike the lute, how will beings come to know? If the Perfected One does not proclaim the true principle, how will beings come to know it? Thus, one gives the Three Treasures, gives the zither and lute—hence the analogy.

At that time, the Wild Mother among the assembly heard the Heavenly Worthy expound on plucking the zither and striking the drum to awaken beings. All repented and awakened, and so she practiced day and night, striking the zither and drum without daring to cease. The Wild Mother then returned to the northern Long Mountains, felled autumn paulownia trees, and crafted bells, drums, zithers, and lutes. Adorned with pearls and dyed in vibrant hues, carved with coiling dragons, strung with yellow silk, and inlaid with polished jade, she gathered three thousand disciples in that land to practice the zither and lute, to strike the floating bells and drums, playing day and night without pause. People from near and far all came to listen to the music—men and women alike, none did not halt their steps. The multitude gathered in the tens of thousands, coming without end. The Wild Mother rejoiced without cease, practicing year after year without change, believing she would ascend as an immortal by dawn and dusk, rising step by step. Yet from youth to old age, each met their end in due time, falling into the Three Wretched Realms.

Thus, the Perfected One never relies on sound yet attains discernment; never presumes to know yet achieves true knowledge. Why? The Perfected One studies the Dao without a master, without receiving instruction; without understanding, there is no reversal; without clarity, there is no proclamation. Thus, the Perfected One does not take oneself as a master yet becomes a master; does not presume to be enlightened yet becomes enlightened; does not seek to manifest yet becomes manifest; does not give of oneself yet bestows. By not taking oneself as a master, not presuming enlightenment, not seeking manifestation, not giving of oneself, all merits reside within—thus one attains perfection.

Therefore, a gāthā says:
Grasping the discourse of the Great Constant,
The myriad dharmas have no fixed form.
Coming and going like the whirling wind,
Flowing eastward, life swiftly passes.
Revolving like surging, boiling waters,
Grievously wounding the human nature.
With profound wisdom, observe future lives—
Thus, abandon the path of compliance.
Cultivate the body in worldly ease,
Yet the fruit is ascent to the supreme.
Myriad afflictions dissolve like clouds,
In purity and non-action, the true corrects the chaotic.
With perfect adornments, radiance fully emerges,
Surpassing the great penetration of the sage.
All the blessings of ordinary beings—
[...]

The *Sublime Scripture of the Original Form of the Wondrous Dharma*, Middle Fascicle, concludes.

The *Sublime Scripture of the Original Form of the Wondrous Dharma*, Lower Fascicle:
Universal Exposition

The Heavenly Worthy said: Within this, for all beings, I universally expound the original form of the sublime wondrous Dharma, the cause of the supreme Way, delivering boundless multitudes. All beings gather in assembly, none do not revere and admire.

At that time, the Eastern Yu, Western Yu, Southern and Northern Yu; the Eastern Lai, Western Lai, Southern and Northern Lai; the Wild Mother, the Unhooked, the Lone Drawer, the Wooden Marquis, the Chicken Deer—all heretical paths—came to be seated. Each shone with radiant brilliance, stirring among the assembly, their numinous majesty resplendent, vying in eloquent words to test and challenge without yielding.

The Yu said: What you spoke yesterday—that all beings, from past karma to future retribution, reap the fruits of their former causes—is not mistaken. Yet I observe that all beings dwell in the heavy chamber of the great night—how can they know the causes of past lives or the retribution of the present body? If they encounter the grace of the Dharma, the fruit of the Dharma may be attained; if they do not, they drift with the current. Like gathering firewood in a stream, those caught by the hook are retrieved; those not caught drift away. All ordinary beings are like firewood in water—those who encounter the teaching attain it; those who do not drift away. How can there be past karma imposed upon them, retribution borne in this life? If it were due to past causes, there would be no need for further action; if relying on past karmic conditions, there would be no need to seek the teaching. The allotment would be complete, no need for provisional reception. What you have said does not accord with the Way of the utmost truth—your words are not yet understood.

The Yu continued: The beings of the ten directions each possess their kind of qi, not dependent on past karma’s creation. For example, birds give birth to birds, beasts to beasts; humans, plants, crawling creatures—each kind begets its like, each type resembles its own. How can there be past causes and karmic retribution? Like melting gold, its color appears according to its kind; like planting seeds, the fruit follows the seed. How can there be transformation contrary to kind? What you have said does not accord with the utmost truth—your words are not yet understood.

The Lai replied: I observe that if parents have four legs, their offspring also have four legs; if parents fly, their offspring also fly; if parents are white or black, their offspring are white or black; if parents can speak, their offspring can speak. Yet there has never been a bird that could gallop a thousand miles.

The Master’s words do not accord with the utmost truth—his understanding remains unclear.

The Lai replied: I observe fish dwelling in still waters, tigers in deep forests, swallows and sparrows near humans, and earthworms in their burrows. Each kind receives its qi and nature, each endowed with its own disposition. How could any consume what is contrary to its nature? The Master’s words do not accord with the utmost truth—his understanding remains unclear.

The Wild Mother said: I see worms beget worms, oysters beget oysters, flies beget flies, and ants beget ants. They feed according to their qi, sustaining their lives—how could their karmic birth alter their form? The Master’s words do not accord with the utmost truth—his understanding remains unclear.

The Unhooked One said: I see that among all beings, those that eat meat produce offspring that eat meat; those that graze on grass produce offspring that graze on grass; those that consume wood produce offspring that consume wood; and those that feed on earth produce offspring that feed on earth. All beings possess their own fixed qi, none borrow from another—how could they be mistaken for a different kind? The Master’s words do not accord with the utmost truth—his understanding remains unclear.

The Lone Archer said: I see that all beings differ in nature, sharing the same substance yet bearing different names. Yin and yang are not the same, and their transformations vary. According to this principle, each possesses its own kind of qi, never altering or changing. If one understands this, then a hundred may be known; if one grasps a single kind, then ten thousand may be known. The Master’s words do not accord with the utmost truth—his understanding remains unclear.

The Wooden Marquis said: I see that to preserve a nation is to preserve its form; to preserve the body is to preserve its shape. Those with flowing hair beget offspring with flowing hair; those that crawl sideways beget offspring that crawl sideways. They are born according to their kind and bear fruit according to their seed—how could they receive what is contrary to their nature? From heaven to earth, there has never been a case of one kind receiving what belongs to another. The Master’s words do not accord with the utmost truth—his understanding remains unclear.

The Cock and the Deer each spoke in turn: "We observe that all living beings—whether square or round, long or short—each receives its qi according to its kind, and their natures are fixed. We have never seen clay smelted into gold or pigs transformed into dogs. Kind begets kind, seed perpetuates seed, each receives its qi without alteration. If alteration were possible, then all ordinary beings, all creatures in motion, would possess past-life causes and conditions, and the virtues they have sown—could these lead to the attainment of the utmost truth? If kinds do not change and are fixed in their reception of life, then your words are all false and deceptive, deluding the ignorant with useless teachings.

We accept only what we see in this present life—what we have wrought, we receive. We will never follow your empty talk of past-life causes or recklessly discuss future retribution, lest we mislead later learners and disrupt the transformation of the land, vainly pleasing the fleeting times. Can such be called divine? If one follows this, one is forever cut off from long life."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "All living beings possess their own conditions and ranks. The deeds accumulated in past lives are received in this life; what is wrought in this life is received in the next. Without cause or condition, how can fruit come to be? Without father or mother, how can a child be born? Without heaven or earth, where would the myriad kinds abide?

It is like planting: without earth, nothing grows. Like flying insects: without wings, they cannot fly. Like swift movement: without space, it cannot proceed. Like clouds and rain: without dragons, they cannot form. Why is this so? If kinds did not rely on one another, all would share the same fate. If kinds were fixed, all would uniformly attain completion. Yet from one father, offspring differ in their reception; from one mother’s milk, their appearances vary. Without cause and condition, all would receive equally; without fortune or misfortune, all would be uniformly strong or weak.

By your reasoning, one could plant in empty space, farm in flowing streams, bear children without a father, or give birth without a mother. One could forge ore into vessels, bind bees to harvest honey, raise silkworms to obtain brocade, or grow hemp to make fine linen. Why? Because ore can be forged, bees can be bound to yield honey, silkworms can be made to spin patterns, and hemp naturally becomes linen. What you achieve differs from my Way.

My Way and yours are not the same; my practice and yours are unequal. Though the name of the Way may be shared, its principles are opposed in direction. Why? I employ the method of cultivating emptiness through reality, practicing the Way through existence, acting for future use, and cultivating without expectation of reward. Thus, knowing diligence but not reward, the fruit naturally responds; knowing action but not arrival, the Way naturally reaches. Withdrawing from achievement, achievement achieves itself; relinquishing fortune, fortune fortifies itself. If one clings to achievement, it cannot be relied upon; if one dwells in fortune, it will be exhausted without end. Therefore, withdrawing from achievement and relinquishing fortune, one ultimately meets with both. Accumulating the practice of the Way over lifetimes, the response of the fruit reaches its destination.

Thus, the perfected ones accumulate deeds over a thousand lifetimes without expecting reward. They cast their foul bodies to eagles and tigers—not hoping for repayment from eagles and tigers, but only pitying their hunger. Therefore, giving without expecting reward, the movement naturally responds; suffering without seeking joy, joy naturally manifests. Thus, knowing action, diligence, practice, and application, one never expects a single lifetime to demand its fruit. This is why my use differs from yours, and our reception of merit is unequal."

The Four Yu, Four Lai, Wild Mother, Unhooked, Lone Puller, Wooden Marquis, Cock, and Deer all refused to believe and said to one another: "The Heavenly Worthy does not teach the utmost truth. He recklessly speaks of empty, future fruits, expounding parables to delude the ignorant, wasting their bodies and forms, and vainly involving them in rebirth. He falsely testifies to future, unrealized fruits, crafting clever words and false analogies, speaking of causes and conditions. Among the four assemblies, those whose minds are deluded and unenlightened waste their years in vain.

At this, those who had intended to stay arose in haste and fled. Then the Heavenly Worthy closed the celestial radiance, and darkness enveloped the four directions. The various Ways were lost, not knowing where to turn, except for the place where he sat, which remained as brightly lit as before, undisturbed. The followers of the Ways returned to the light and asked: "What ominous portent has caused the sudden absence of light and the darkness in the four directions, leaving travelers lost and turning back? We do not know what has caused this strange event."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "The celestial light has vanished of itself—what concern is it of yours? You accumulate the arts of the Way and soar through empty space, your might and spirit unmatched in the world. How could darkness confine you or cause you to speak of being lost? I merely speak of future, unrealized fruits and guide the ignorant with past teachings—how would I know why the light has closed?"

Yu said: "Our Way knows only of long life, short life, and flying—we have not beheld such principles. Heavenly Worthy, distinguish this for us: if we can understand, then we will know that you have attained the fruit of causes and conditions and the merit of the future. If we cannot, then we will know your words are false."

The Heavenly Worthy then smiled joyfully, and radiance issued from his mouth, illuminating the ten directions and brightly revealing the Eight Purities. They saw all they had received in past lives and all they were destined for in the future, witnessing the deeds of former times, each clearly reflected. The four kinds of beings saw their past, future, and present states, all their destinies and rebirths, none unseen.

They beheld the divine immortals’ palaces atop Kunlun’s summit—a wall four thousand *li* square, with twelve hundred gates encircling it. Within were three thousand six hundred smaller palaces, jade towers and golden halls, five cities with twelve gates each. The ground was made entirely of lapis lazuli, adorned with coral, silver foil, and strands of pearls, intricately layered in a thousand folds, their brilliance unmatched.

Then they beheld the Heavenly Thearch ruling at the center, with the thirty-two Heavenly Kings assisting on all four sides. At the four corners stood towering palaces, exquisitely adorned, where four Heavenly Thearchs governed, with celestial dragons, ghosts, and spirits attending on either side. Above Kunlun, such wondrous music resounded beyond all reckoning.

At that moment, the Four Yu, Four Lai, and all those of heterodox paths awakened in their hearts, never to regress, and thus attained the Dao of earthly immortals.

Then Elder Jing asked: "All beings have their karmic conditions, and human actions are repaid according to the deeds they accumulate. Take the Four Yu and Four Lai—formerly they did not believe in the true and authentic, so they fell into heterodoxy. Though they once strayed, exerting their own power without following true teachings, they rebelled and departed, returning in confusion. Yet even now, though they still do not fully believe, their faith is not entirely exhausted. In a single moment of belief, what they attain is lofty. How is this so?"

The answer came: "These twelve heterodox paths, when they first embarked on the Dao, all arose from deluded and false causes. They encountered unorthodox masters, received unorthodox *qi*, and when that *qi* took form, they fell into heterodoxy. Their spirits became attached, and thus they were called heterodox paths. Now, through this single turning of faith, by the merit of this returning faith, they have attained the Dao of earthly immortals. The Four Yu possess abundant roots of wisdom, so they will ultimately revolve into the ranks of the Great Dao and Great Perfection. Why is this? For those who cultivate the Dao, the initial resolve is prized, but what matters is their later attainment. Thus they receive the reward of a single fruit. It is like planting a tree that bears fruit—if frost, hail, or bitter winds strike in a given year, breaking its branches, the fruit is lost. But when the seasons later become temperate, the flowers set fruit, yielding abundance and sweetness. Thus, though the tree ripens in due season, it preserves at least one fruit. Why? The tree is like the scholar; the flowers are like their fruits; frost and hail are like heterodox masters. Though they were once led astray by heterodoxy, now they have turned to true teachings.

The Eastern Yu was originally a man from the Central Plains of the Eastern Sea. In his youth, he cultivated the Dao and aspired to become a divine immortal, but midway he encountered the teachings of a false master and practiced deception, thus earning the name of a false path.

The Western Yu was from Jin Cang in the Western Sea. In his youth, he loved the supreme Dao and neglected worldly affairs, but midway he encountered the teachings of the Wild Mother, which he practiced incorrectly. Cultivating her methods, he became tainted by heterodox *qi*. His practice was unorthodox, the heterodox *qi* attached to him, and his spirit became stained. Believing himself a true immortal, he was called a heterodox path.

The Southern Lai was from Yang Ze in the Southern Sea. In his youth, he practiced Daoist arts and aspired to the purple of high rank, but midway he encountered the teachings of the Three Aspirations, which he delighted in and applied. The *qi* attached to him, and he became an outsider.

The Northern Lai was from Cang Chi in the Northern Sea. In his youth, he was drawn to Daoist teachings, but in adulthood he encountered the methods of a heterodox master and followed them, believing them to be the true and authentic Dao. Practicing them, he was called heterodox.

The Wild Mother was a woman from the distant West. In her youth, she cultivated the Dao and rejected worldly customs, but midway she encountered perverse and deviant teachings, which she practiced and thus fell outside the principles of the true teaching. Heterodox *qi* attached to her, her essence transformed into spirit, and those who imitated her were all called heterodox paths.

The Unhooked was from Han Chi in the North. In his youth, he loved the Dao and did not follow the common crowd, but midway he encountered the teachings of a false master, which he devotedly practiced. Thus heterodox *qi* entered and attached to him, and his spirit became imitable. Practicing accordingly, he was called a heterodox path.

The Lone Draught was from Wuji in the East. In his youth, he loved Daoist arts and was devoted to the true and authentic, but midway he encountered the teachings of a false master, which he practiced and thus fell into heterodoxy. His methods were easily corrupted, and his master was untrustworthy.

Thus, the master is the father and mother of the Daoist. Like nursing a child with milk and sweetness, one must seek the finest and purest. Therefore, the true person chooses a master to study under and can thus attain perfection. They examine the Dao and cultivate it, and thus can accomplish the Dao. Why? All paths that lead to heterodoxy stem from the master’s teachings not being true. When a tree’s flowers are struck by frost, it is also due to the craftsman’s lack of skill. To be led astray by external teachings is due to the mind’s lack of firmness.

For the scholar, first resolve, then vow; one must preserve their authenticity. First contemplate, then diligently practice, and one will surely reach their fruition. Thus, the Daoist must strengthen their resolve, fortify their precepts, secure their heart, and scrutinize their intentions. They must choose a master to cultivate under, select good companions to practice with, and reflect thrice in seeking benefit—how could they err? Pursuing an enlightened master without shunning hardship, gaining three benefits each day—how could they falter?

Thus, cultivating the Dao is not easy, and being a master is even more difficult. It is like travelers journeying together through perilous paths. Of a thousand or ten thousand, none may reach their destination. But if one or two are learned enough to guide the crowd and brave enough to resist the foolish, resolutely protecting the timid, calming the bandits ahead, then all the travelers can pass through safely. Of a thousand or ten thousand companions, none will fail to receive grace. If a scholar encounters a good companion, it is the same.

Therefore, the true person does not practice recklessly or act carelessly, thus attaining non-action. Discarding what is harmful and embracing what is beneficial, they accomplish the Dao by this means."

Yu asked the Heavenly Worthy: "All the myriad dharmas—from what do they arise, and by what *qi* do they exist? I only wish the Heavenly Worthy would explain their causes and conditions, so that all beings may know from whence they come."

The answer came: "All the myriad dharmas arise by receiving the *qi* of the Dao and are completed through emptiness. Why? The Dao is formless, yet responds to *qi* in myriad forms. Emptiness is without division, yet permeates and moves all that has form. Without emptiness and without *qi*, all speech and thought are obliterated. Without speech and without thought, the ten thousand existences vanish. Thus, the Dao is the father of the myriad things, and emptiness is the mother of the myriad things."

Why is this so? It is like the father as yang and the mother as yin—through cause and effect, through the breath of the womb, after ten months a form is attained. A name is given, a designation bestowed, and thus the Way of father and son, the ranks of honor and humility, are established. If there were no father, from whence would the child be born? If there were no mother, how would the breath of the womb be fulfilled? Therefore, emptiness circulates and pervades all dwelling within it, and thus we know it as the mother. Without cause, the child would not exist; without the child, how could there be emptiness? If there is a child, then emptiness is the mother of the ten thousand existences.

Thus, the Dao gives birth and virtue nurtures, borrowing existence as if a form were present. Without the child, how could the filial Way be made manifest? Without existence, how could emptiness be discerned? Therefore, being and non-being give rise to one another—this is what is meant.

Thus, the perfected person constantly cultivates emptiness, honoring it as the mother, and constantly follows the Dao, revering it as the father. Therefore, to honor the Dao and esteem emptiness is to hold in reverence what is greatest. Why? Because our origin lies in father and mother, and so what we revere is greatest. Yet there are beings, regardless of high or low station, who do not know what they should value, who harm their own forms and sever their own roots. Why? It is like a tree—if one hacks away at its roots, not one in ten thousand will survive. If one exposes its roots, it will wither in winter. Those who recklessly lose the Dao are likewise. They are like a tree growing upside-down, like a fish cast from the water—though they live for a time, their lives will not be long.

Thus, the perfected person guards the Dao with firmness, attaining long endurance, deepening the roots and strengthening the stem to bring forth blossoms and preserve countenance. Therefore, they do not act in violation, nor do they act in opposition, and thus find peace and joy in this.

Yu said: "I have received this grace. I wish to ask further for clarification. The Dao is most true, taking non-speech as its essence, without body or form, borrowing emptiness and non-being as its foundation. Yet I wonder—those perfected persons who dwell within blessings, what methods do they honor and cultivate? What substance do they expound? From what do they arouse their minds?"

From what does intention arise? How does one attain such a position? I wish for you to distinguish this clearly, that all who come after may hear and know.

The answer: Your question is most essential and wondrous. Listen carefully, and I shall distinguish it for you. The utmost truth has no form—cultivating emptiness, one attains its reality. The supreme Dharma has no speech—following its patterns, one attains the Dao. Ever mindful of the suffering and affliction of sentient beings, grieving for the world, they broadly save all. Throughout the day, they act without concern for their own bodies; all their lives, they preserve salvation without relying on the self for the self. By this mindfulness, they move and respond naturally. Unwearied in practice, they thus attain the title of *Great Perfected*.

It is like boiling salty earth—one need only tend the fire, and in time, the whole cauldron will teem with life. People need only practice compassion, and joy will naturally return to them. Why is this? When malicious thoughts arise, one dreams of harm; when virtuous thoughts emerge, one dreams of auspicious signs. Thus, acting with poison brings calamity; acting with goodness brings blessing. Therefore, one knows that acting without thought of reward, the fruit ripens of itself; sowing without thought of harvest, the yield is abundant. The Dao of true nature is likewise.

The question: If the mind is upright, it is repaid with true response; if the mind is crooked, it is repaid with deceit. It depends solely on the mind—does one not require a model? Earlier, you spoke of this: if the master is true, the disciple is upright; if the master is false, the disciple is deceitful. Yet today, your explanation seems at variance. I wish for you to distinguish this, that all who do not understand may receive clarification.

The answer: If the master is enlightened, there is no danger of entanglement; if the master is benighted, they fall prey to demonic forces. Without a master, how can one cultivate the Dao? Without mindfulness, how can one practice goodness? Thus, an enlightened master practices great compassion, severs extravagance and greed, and master and disciple inquire together, good companions learning from one another. How could one study the Dao of *Shangqing* without a master? Therefore, the master is like a father—without a father, from where does the child arise? Without a master, from where does the Dao take form? This is why the enlightened master is esteemed.

Why is this? The enlightened master is clear in the methods of the Dao, without error. Those who follow describe it truly, the upright transmission uncorrupted. Evil influences do not disturb it, merit is accomplished, and virtue is perfected, thus attaining the Dao of utmost truth and non-action. Therefore, the enlightened and the benighted differ, the worthy and the foolish are distinct. Their practices vary, their studies diverge, and their karmic responses follow accordingly. Thus, master and disciple emulate one another, friends learn from one another—this is what is meant.

Plain silk changes without constancy, taking the dye the artisan applies. If the nature is dyed black, it shifts with the craftsman’s art. Once stained and adhered, it cannot be scraped away; once glued and pressed, it cannot be torn apart. The influence of demonic forces is likewise. Why is this? Just as purple and vermilion mixed half-and-half will dull the red, or the waters of the Zī and Mian intermingled for ten days will confuse their taste—thus, those who dwell in purity delight in purity and despise filth, while those who dwell in filth do not esteem refinement but prize their own squalor. Matters of like kind differ in substance; the Dao follows its course, and companionship follows its nature. The perception of right and wrong is likewise.

Things of like nature receive alike, taken and given from the same vessel—though their names may be the same, their emptiness and fullness are not equal. Therefore, the great person dwells in depth, not in shallowness, and thus preserves depth. Ever abiding in simplicity, they await the enlightened artisan. Those who dwell in shallowness will never receive the artisan’s touch. Thus, the noble person recognizes depth and knows simplicity, and so abides in their proper place, neither recklessly staining nor recklessly acting, and thus maintains their station.

Clarity extinguished, one perishes; preserving it, one endures. Recklessly stained by demonic customs, the body is surely ruined; recklessly acting without uprightness, the form is surely destroyed. Therefore, the noble person guards trustworthiness in this.

Illuminated conduct is like snow; profound virtue retreats like a valley. Holding to truth is like loss; following the artisan is like duty. Preparing the Dao is like guarding against thieves; hitting the mark is like whiteness. When merit and conduct are as bright as snow, one nears the Dao. Neither leveling nor obscuring nor seeking, the manifold fruits flourish threefold, attaining non-action.

Why is this? Illuminated conduct is self-purifying, without defilement. Profound virtue is the mind abiding in the great Dao, undisturbed and unburdened. Holding to truth is the will harmonizing with the Dao and things, guarding stillness without wavering. Following the artisan is traversing the bright path, as if pursuing honor and emolument. Preparing the Dao is fortifying against the four quarters’ treacherous foes, ever fearful of downfall. Hitting the mark is fearing the arrow may miss, the mind unwavering. Unceasing in these six matters, one nearly attains non-action.

Thus, the perfected person practices these six matters, and the six virtues gather therein. Therefore, the Daoist’s taking and giving differ, their holdings vary. Without the six severances complete, how can one attain non-action? Without cutting off the five colors, how can one reach the wondrous realm? Merit incomplete, the sleeve too short—none may walk the path. Courageously practicing the Dao, ice and boiling water dissolve one another.

Why is this? A bird’s nest that does not rest has no place of peace. Desiring to be dyed by the Dao, one meets emptiness. Without cutting off the five colors, where can one lodge in emptiness? Thus, the perfected person does not nest the mind in the nest and so can achieve nesting; departing from the five colors, they can achieve truth.

The noble person does not act yet acts, does not use yet uses, is not esteemed yet is esteemed, does not rely yet relies. What they rely upon are the Three Treasures, and thus the Daoist’s conduct is the opposite of the vulgar. Why is this? The vulgar esteem greed, while the Daoist values frugality; the vulgar esteem killing, while the Daoist values longevity; the vulgar esteem licentiousness, while the Daoist values chastity. Though their actions may appear the same, their purposes differ, and their rewards are not equal. Thus, the Dao and the vulgar are opposites—this is what is meant.

Governing the self and governing the state follow the same principle. The path of the journey and the destination share the same pattern.

Why is this so? In cultivating the self, cutting off thoughts brings tranquility to the spirit; in governing the state, eliminating vexations brings peace to the realm. If one’s aspirations remain unfulfilled, their plans will not succeed. Thus, the Perfected Person observes the state to cultivate the self, examines principles to practice the Way, and acts throughout the day to attain non-action. Therefore, reducing what must be reduced ultimately leads to the Great Dao. Why is this so? By daily diminishing the unwholesome and daily increasing the wholesome, when wayward thoughts arise, cast them aside at once; when vexing notions stir, burn them immediately—thus avoiding the snares of entanglement.

A great state falls because of its unwholesomeness; fertile fields are ruined for the same reason. What is unwholesome is the corruption of the Way. Why is this so? If fertile fields are abandoned, weeds flourish; if a great state is vexed, the people rebel; if the people rebel, arms and armor contend, and the world falls into despair—this is what is meant.

Why is this so? The people are the root of the ruler, and the ruler is the honor of the people. Without the people, the ruler has no security; thus, one must not treat the people lightly, for they are the root, nor treat the ruler lightly, for he is the honor. Therefore, neither can be slighted or disdained. Observe how flowing waters cannot be long preserved, and shifting things cannot rest in stillness. Thus, the wise observe and practice the Way, while the foolish cling to delusion and never awaken. The Perfected Person gazes upon this and acts accordingly, attaining non-action—expansive in salvation, restrained in conduct, enduring without perishing. Those who do not perish keep their spirit eternally present, never parting from their form; thus, they die yet do not perish—this is what is meant.

The path of delusion is not distant; the demonic way does not endure. Those who rely on themselves fail to comprehend; those who enlighten themselves fail to manifest. Why is this so? Like a lone traveler on a journey, the lost will surely fall into peril; those who claim enlightenment without guidance will inevitably face demonic obstacles. Why is this so? Those who study without a teacher will mislead later learners; those who wander blindly through myriad dangers will surely meet with disaster. Thus, the Perfected Person ascends the high ridge and walks without losing the way, following an enlightened teacher to learn, never erring from beginning to end. Therefore, the Daoist acts with careful discernment.

To transmit without clarity is to leak; to teach without a teacher is to obstruct. Illness left untreated will fester and kill. Delusion uncorrected leads to ruin on treacherous paths. Galloping down steep slopes leaves many tracks and surely ends in a fall. A rigid and overbearing tree will snap. A coarse tool in fine craftsmanship will chip the vessel. Water eroding the bank will carve deep hollows. Fine silk torn by the wind will surely split. A tree in a dense forest will suffer from tangled leaves. The demonic way, if not abandoned, melts the marrow like snow. A sharp blade turned inward will cut by its own radiance. A clumsy hand wielding an axe will surely harm itself. The impoverished who force generosity will dissipate and fail. The weak and destitute who recklessly rush will never reach the sunlit plain. Planting in sandy mounds will not sustain drought-stricken seedlings. A toppled tree with flourishing branches will break without being cut. Building a house without windows and doors will not stand. Setting a crossbow without releasing the string will not strike the target. Carving unseasoned wood will not hold its joints. Crossing great waters without rowing the oar will not reach the far shore. To walk the constant Way without complete adherence to its precepts is likewise. Why is this so?

The perfected person first carves windows and doors before building a house, fastens the bowstring before loosing the arrow, sharpens the axe and chisel before shaping unhewn wood, secures the oar and rudder before sailing the waters. With all necessities prepared, nothing remains unconquered. The perfected person’s virtue and conduct likewise attain success through such means.

The Dao makes no distinction of near or far—only goodness is drawn close. The true holds no rank of noble or base—cultivate it, and it responds. Merit is not bestowed in vain—where it is given, resonance follows. Action does not cease—pursue it, and arrival is certain. Why is this so?

If there were partiality, the peril of factional entanglement would arise. If there were hierarchy, the calamity of arrogance and resentment would follow. Thus, the Dao is neither near nor far, yet responds to all near and far; neither noble nor base, yet answers all noble and base. Therefore, the perfected person neither exalts the high nor scorns the low, yet the mind remains serene. They neither disdain the humble nor overlook the obscure. Their luminous conduct leaves no gaps; they cast off dust without attachment.

They shun the five desires and hundred distractions, dismissing idle chatter without utterance. They do not heed slanderous speech nor covet fine gains. They banish the six evils to embrace the six penetrations. With boundless nurturance and vast salvation, they transform their former abode. Leaving the root to dwell in the present, they perfect utmost truth. With the three clarities and six attainments, their wisdom arises naturally. Their station reaches the highest, governing all perfected immortals. Like a mother’s nurturing care, they treat all equally. They bestow widely upon beings, reaping according to each one’s nature.

Inconceivable, it is called the Empty, Supreme, Utmost True Dao. Empty boasts are like vain bragging—seek them, and they cannot be fathomed. Artful words are like false beauty—examine them, and they lack foundation. This may be termed dwelling in existence while speaking of emptiness, losing virtue through cleverness. Such a path withdraws, descending not upon its practitioner. Why is this so?

The Dao responds to substance, not to emptiness. Thus, substance is the beginning of practicing emptiness, the origin of attaining truth. Therefore, the perfected person’s words never drift into idle talk, their conduct never strays into deceitful craft. Thus, their virtue is perfected without concealment, their merit shines without diminishment, achieving the state of non-action.

Their luminous teaching is like the sun—its use is inexhaustible. Their conduct is like the tongue—used without breaking. Their clarity is like jade—its luster remains unstained. Their nature is like water—its flow never reverses. Their enlightened speech is like snow—its use never wears out. Their words are like unguent—applied without ceasing. Their bright precepts are like the sun—never failing in use. Their grasp is like a knot—never loosening.

Lofty yet not proud, humble yet not ashamed; virtuous yet not self-satisfied, pure yet not rigid. They empty themselves without pause, hold fast to the Dao without wavering. They bestow great compassion tirelessly, ever mindful of salvation. They do not claim merit for themselves—virtue resonates naturally. All wisdom fuses within; myriad virtues share a single cause. Merit accumulates without end.

So towering are they that the nine immortals transcend all bounds, attaining the supreme truth of non-action.

A great state insatiably greedy will surely be afflicted by calamity. Bandits insatiably greedy will surely be pursued by officials. Relying on strength to bully the weak, unaware of excess, will surely be trapped by the mighty. Clinging to nobility to oppress the upright, unaware of crookedness, will surely be ruined by misfortune. Thus, governing the self and governing the state are the same.

Why is this so? Those who rely on virtue flourish; those who rely on strength perish. Those who uphold loyalty endure; those who depend on nobility falter. Those who aid tyranny labor in vain; those who side with the doomed stand alone. Therefore, the perfected person upholds loyalty to endure, distances themselves from falsity to attain longevity. Neither perishing nor isolated, they take companions as kin, kindred spirits as dear. Thus, they abandon that and embrace this.

One who tunes music with a glued bridge will wear their nails to the quick without completing the melody. One who rides a horse with severed reins will reach perilous heights only to be dashed against the cliffs. Though there may be the sound of music-making, there will be no melody of measured rhythm. Though there may be the gallop of a horse, there will be no destination of reason and principle.

Those who cling to fixed views in cultivating the Dao are likewise thus. The Dao is vast and not to be abbreviated; true qi circulates in perfect harmony, extending even to the crawling creatures, nourishing all things. Why is this so? Without the Dao, the myriad things cannot come into being; without the Dao, cultivation of emptiness cannot be accomplished. Therefore, one who knows the vast yet does not constrict, who knows frugality yet does not indulge, abides in insufficiency and thus attains enduring sufficiency. Knowing insufficiency, they diligently practice it and thus attain enduring sufficiency. If one deems insufficiency sufficient, it will ultimately remain insufficient; if one deems the unexalted exalted, it will ultimately remain unexalted; if one deems the unpracticed practiced, it will ultimately remain unpracticed; if one deems the unresolved resolved, it will ultimately remain unresolved. Thus, the perfected person abides in insufficiency, dwells in the unexalted, and thereby attains non-action.

Words that are not true leave no form. Why is this so? The Dao is hidden and wordless, yet teachings through words fill all; the Dao is hidden and formless, yet through its formlessness, forms arise and responses manifest. Therefore, it cannot be pondered or debated, nor can it be fathomed.
