**Song of Burning the Medicine Bag**
Medicine bag, medicine bag—detached from my elbow,
For twenty years you’ve been my knowing friend.
At times you’ve clothed me in silks and satins,
At times you’ve drowned me in wine and flowers.
Through countless households, rich and poor alike,
No day or hour passed without your tread at my door.
You’ve muddled the wellspring of glory,
Bewildered the inch of the pulse,
Piling disaster upon disaster with reckless moxa and needles.
For you, I’ve accumulated merit and practiced arts in vain;
Through you, disputes and karmic debts have arisen.
Today I burn you without hesitation,
For my heart is no longer what it once was.
The medicine bag, engulfed in flame, unleashes divine might,
Its roar like thunder shaking the heavens.
Compared to the scalding broth I once offered you,
You now repent—your body and mind struck first.
The source of fortune clears,
The root of sin decays.
Leaping free, I shed this mortal husk.
Barrier mountains rise a thousand fathoms, their peaks piercing clouds,
The bitter sea surges a thousand leagues, its waves clashing with the stars.
The Dao of Heaven is lofty—how lofty is it?
The Dao of Earth is deep—how deep is it?
Earth has its apertures, Heaven its ladder,
Sun and moon alternate in brightness, undisturbed by dusk or dawn.
Azure clouds and white qi intertwine in purity,
Black mists and crimson vapors swirl within the void.
At the center they merge, forming a radiant treasure,
Its light piercing straight through the azure heavens.
The original form, the wondrous body, delights in this life,
One with the Great Void, boundless and eternal.

**Song of the Tarnished Mirror**
Alas, tarnished mirror! Alas, tarnished mirror!
Its pure body cannot withstand the dust’s clinging grasp.
Though sturdy in its bronze form,
Its face and features are no longer bright compared to its first state.
The shape remains round as before,
Yet within, the luminous nature of roundness is obscured.
To apply the wondrous medicine and polish it anew,
Washing away the filth and stains of the past—
The whole body, transparent and unobstructed, becomes resplendent,
Revealing the crookedness of others.
Sealed in a jade casket, hidden deep in the grotto chamber,
It remains eternally pure, enduring as heaven and earth.

**Song of Awakening to Futile Toil**
Awakening to futile toil! Awakening to futile toil!
Once awakened, I gladly partake of coarse fare and pickled dregs.
The hues of Mount Shouyang harbor vain resentment,
The waves of the Miluo River churn with empty rage.
Ten battles won, the sword beheads the chieftain,
One act of defiance, the blade carves out the heart.
The ancients, unknowing, met such calamities—
Why do men of today, though aware, still suffer them?
What is clear may be displayed,
What is hidden may be concealed.
To know the difficulty yet not retreat—fools indeed!
Burning the corpse, swallowing charcoal—thrice ponder the folly,
Discarding the gourd, burying the dice—a single move excels.
We, the mediocre and dull,
Drape ourselves in blue and purple, strutting as heroes.
Swiftly decide to gather the Three Treasures,
Lest delay turn your hair to frost.
Awaken within the dream,
Escape beyond the world.
Light furs and silk sashes exchanged for hempen robes,
A gaunt frame of seven feet, tapping a dragon-headed staff,
A thread of complexion three spans long, binding a tiger’s sash.
Wide sleeves sweep open the path of no affairs,
Straw sandals tread through the prison of attachments.
In the Hall of Eternal Light, golden millet is sown,
In the Garden of Vital Qi, jade paste is cultivated.
The chicken transforms into a phoenix,
The carp becomes a turtle.
The resolve to cultivate the Dao soars beyond the clouds.
Voices ascend to the crimson towers, proclaiming the Way,
Resounding like immortal birds crying in the nine marshes.

**Song of the Rustic Fool**
The Two Modes, high and deep, form a wondrous pair,
From them, the myriad things are born and take shape.
Among the myriad things, none is nobler than man,
Yet how few among men can guard their noble essence?
Yesterday, I sighed for this life of mine,
Neither disgraced nor honored, thanks to Heaven’s protection.
I too have gathered and scattered with heroes,
Unburdened by hunger or cold, free from the dust of the world.
Now, old and withered in this former frame,
I deeply resent the mockery of fools who call me rustic.
Deaf and blind, half-witted and dull,
Lame and hunchbacked, my mouth sealed against profit.
I dare not speak idly to others,
Yet when I utter loyal words, they benefit knowing friends.
The Jade Pond churns, turning the eight elixirs,
Watering the rootless tree to immortality.
Others scramble in busyness, possessing nothing within,
While my livelihood arises from nothingness.
Be it deep night or bright day,
In sitting, lying, dwelling, or walking, I forget the body’s inquiry.
Silent and serene, I settle without ceasing,
Turning the celestial wheel, operating the mechanism’s mortar.
Earth’s qi surges,
Heaven’s rain pours,
Filling rivers and seas, suffusing the cosmos.
Tortoises follow serpents in racing pursuit,
Tigers roar and dragons bellow in fierce embrace.
Lofty pavilions and jade-towered halls rise in splendor,
The cavern of Mount Jing resounds with the howling of numinous winds.
Riding this wind, I ascend back to the Great Void,
Piercing through the Gate of Heaven in a crashing breakthrough.
Fragrant clouds, laden with fragrance, cradle the moon’s glow,
Auspicious mists, drifting and dense, shroud the stars.
Do not say the path of cultivation is not arduous—
To resent others’ ignorance is itself a grievous error.
If you have not yet arrived, vow to arrive,
If you have not yet attained, resolve to attain.
Offer the incense of a vast and uncluttered heart,
Beseeching the immortal masters for eternal companionship.

**Song of Lament for Not Recognizing Nature and Life**
To cultivate without recognizing the true empty nature
Is like polishing a tarnished mirror in a vat of glue and lacquer.
Exhausting effort in endless polishing,
Yet in the end, clarity and brightness remain elusive.
True empty nature! True empty nature!
Without color or sound, beyond sight or hearing.
Hidden or manifest, the void is not truly void—
Seek it and it cannot be seen, call it and it responds.
To cultivate the Dao without recognizing the true original life
Is like plucking leaves to seek branches, forcing a door’s hinge.
Empty sprouts may grow, but they bear no fruit,
Neglecting the primal essence, the fruit remains unproven.
True original life! True original life!
The Supreme Ultimate divides its form, becoming the root’s handle.
Within the effortless transformations of the myriad things,
Surpassing creation’s work, one may become a sage.
To cultivate only life, not nature,
Is like adorning a stubborn chime with black gold—
Shatter the stubborn form, and it falls into emptiness,
Yet one remains mired in the quagmire of void and purity.
To cultivate only nature, not life,
Is like water and fire failing to merge, like scorched rice—
Life incomplete, nature unreal,
Stubborn emptiness drifts through the yin realms.
Cultivate both nature and life,
Emerging from delusion’s illness.
When nature and life are both complete, the mystery deepens,
In one leap, far removed from the wheel’s endless path.

**Song of Lament for Worldly Acquaintances**
The Primal Simplicity scatters, bequeathing forms to things,
Things perish and arise, driven by cold and heat.
The world knows peace and strife, portents of human karma,
Emotions mourn and rejoice, affairs unite and part.
With body and nature, we come, yet remain obscured,
Lives long or short, we depart, still lost in confusion.

Through this awakening, I distance myself from harm,
Dwelling idly in a humble lane, my heart remains unshackled.
A year passes like a fleeting gap—spring and autumn shift,
A day turns in an instant—sunlight and twilight drift.

Bamboo fence and thatched hut—here I roam free,
Amid the fields of fame and ranks of gain, who knows honor or disgrace?
The clamor of right and wrong, like battling ants—why discern?
The misty isles of Penglai—this alone may be sought.

The Great Dao of non-action—even ghosts and spirits revere,
Uttermost truth, most profound—heaven and earth bear witness.
*Song of Lament for the Lack of a Knowing Friend*
Daoist livelihood—hard for men to find,
Even if one appears, he labors at other arts.
Chasing names, seeking profit, his outward guise seems stern,
Lost in words, clinging to doctrines, his inner work is forfeit.

The Dao’s essence is subtle, virtue’s function is veiled,
Contention leaves but bare branches—empty, still.
Speak, yet do not speak—others remain deluded,
Worry, yet only for your own shortcomings.

Have you not seen?
A thousand streams, ten thousand waves—though their forms differ,
Those who grasp source and flow ultimately return to one.
Have you not seen?
Divergent paths, varied trails—each step diverges,
Yet those who know the tracks and ruts share the same awakening.

Expand and uphold your original nature,
Embodying the perfect clarity of motion and stillness;
Nurture and sustain your true life,
Unraveling the transformations of heaven and earth.

Facing the wall in silent sitting, I seek the legacy of Bodhidharma;
Reclining at ease, I follow the fragrant traces of Master Xiyi.
When nature settles and life abides,
One attains the spontaneity of the profound and obscure;
In crystalline meditation,
The subtle workings of the numinous source are revealed.

At times, in dreams, I enter grotto-heavens,
Or soar freely in flight;
Now a Jade Maiden bears ambrosia,
Now a Golden Youth offers aid.
Though the Three Thousand Merits remain unfulfilled,
My name is inscribed in the register of the Nine-Turned Golden Elixir.
One day, when perfection is complete,
My merit will be recorded in the annals of immortals.

To hear and act upon this is to penetrate principle with certainty;
For those who earnestly receive the teaching, delusion shatters in an instant.
Sincere counsel—heed it well,
Lest habit and procrastination waste your days in vain.
When the mirror of nature dims, polish it anew,
When the lamp of the heart flickers, tend it diligently.

Preserve your qi-essence, refine the spirit-fluid,
Sow in the morning, reap by evening—know this yourself.
The mystery within this gateway is true cultivation;
If not cultivated here, where else shall it be sought?

Round eloquence on the tongue, yet the heart remains untouched—
Outwardly genuine, inwardly false, mere street-corner adornment.
Have you not heard?
When Ziqi perished, Boya’s zither fell silent;
When Zhang Hua passed, who wielded the peerless sword?

Once summoned to serve,
A single mat in a square chamber,
My body, coiled like a cushion, knows no constraint,
As boundless as tumbleweed drifting to the ends of the earth.
May I meet a kindred spirit to speak of concealment and revelation,
Exhaling rainbow mists, pouring out the depths of my heart.

*Song for a Daoist Friend Stricken by Grievous Illness*
Alas, alas—this bodily frame!

Once born—why then must you die?
Once unborn—why come to be?
Is it you who peddled your head in haste?
Or I who loved to plunge into rebirth?

O dung-coffin, dung-coffin, bear me back in defeat.
This time cast aside, all dragged away, all buried deep.
No need to pour libations before the painted casket,
No need to seek mourners’ banners or dirge-bearers’ sway.

The noble praise, the base deride—
A farcical play to dispatch the body’s go-between.
Heart earnest, mouth laughing,
Trivial human courtesies arrayed like fish in ranks.

The angler casts his line, heedless of the hookless bait;
He gathers his rod and descends the fishing platform’s height.
Eternal winds brush sleeves of purity,
A single moon illumines Penglai’s isle.

*Song Bequeathed to Disciples*
Summon my disciples, hear these faithful words I leave:
When I am sick, seek no physician’s art;
When I depart, shed no tears to grieve.
The three-inch true qi is gone,
The four limbs are but corpse’s sinew and bone.

Send me off without a painted coffin’s hue,
Choose no grave by yin-yang divination’s view.
Ask not the hour’s fortune or ill,
But seat me in the valley of clouds and mist.

Cease the funeral board’s display,
Let kin’s gifts lie idle, unused.
If blameless, dwell in heaven or among men;
If guilty, descend to hell’s abyss.

Seek not the mercy of the worthy and sage,
Fear not the clans of ghosts and gods.
Should you rely on eulogies and chants,
The sins of this cast-off form remain unredeemed.

There is a mechanism beyond the dust—
Prepare in advance the blessings of true cultivation.

*Seven-Character Regulated Verse: Expressing My Feelings*

The mind at leisure stands serene and high,
With coarse hemp robes and simple fare, all worldly hues defy.
When eyes grow weary, I lay aside the half-unrolled scroll,
When hands grow slack, I leave the broken lute strings whole.

My heart finds rest in poetry’s unpaid debt,
My joy needs no coin to buy the wine I fret.
To stretch or bend, I follow fate’s decree,
Like drifting duckweed or tumbleweed, I pass the years with glee.

Content in poverty, my patched robe thin,
I fear no biting wind that chills the bone within.
Too lazy even to wash my face each day,
Too idle for my fingers to fasten hair in array.

On stone bed’s coolness, sleep is sweet and deep,
In cotton nest’s soft warmth, I sit and wake from sleep.
Beyond this flesh, my heart and soul take flight,
The storm may rage, yet leaves me undisturbed in light.

*Self-Joy*

The world is bound in profit’s chains and fame’s tight tether,
Yet I, though poor, rejoice in tranquil leisure’s weather.
My mind’s pure realm holds wonders manifold,
While red dust’s whirls beyond me ebb and flow untold.

No need to vie by plunging in the stream,
No need to hide on Shang’s peaks to dream.
Beneath the willow’s shade, my rope-bed sways,
In silent stillness, dawn to dusk I spend my days.

*Admonition to the Multitude*

With heart at ease, my spirit calm and clear,
I sing wild songs, then sing again to cheer.
Magic herbs draw earth’s qi to bloom,
Celestial nectar flows through heaven’s loom.

Cut worldly thoughts to keep the immortal’s creed,
Drive off the poetry demon—let Dao’s demon lead.
If you grasp these demons’ meaning true,
You’ll outdo even me in madness too.

*Good and Evil*

Good and evil both arise from one same source,
Yet their uses differ in their course.
Kind words should fall like rain that nurtures flowers,
Anger’s gusts should not be winter’s icy powers.

By the phoenix’s house, old willows stand,
Beyond the tiger’s den, melons grow in the land.
The sages of old were not without their wit,
Yet they forgot all words to find joy in poverty’s pit.

*Warning Against Harming the Multitude*

The tongue may sweetly scent, the belly foully reek,
Such friendships drag men down to ruin’s deep.
Fair faces dare not break the precept’s hold,
Cunning words betray the caution’s code untold.

When deceitful thoughts arise, heart and mouth divide,
When lying lips part, the mouth betrays the heart inside.
Cease not in schemes to always win the fight,
For when defeat arrives, calamity runs deep as night.

*Diligent Cultivation*

Awakened to truth, leave the Five Lakes behind,
With heart resolved, no need to roam the mountains blind.
Within the rise and fall of heaven and earth’s span,
The clouds and rain are drawn in breath’s ebb and flow’s plan.

Refine the Five Phases to forge the Three Fields’ treasure,
Command the myriad changes to return the Nine Qi’s measure.
This six-foot frame holds no fixed form,
Why then should aught disturb my calm?

*Idle Days: Expressing My Feelings*

Willows by the gate, pines in the yard where melons grow,
An alchemy furnace, scriptures—this old life’s tableau.
Startled by the crow’s cry knocking on the fragrant tree,
At ease, I lure the wandering bees to wildflowers free.

My sleeves dance in the wind as I turn and sway,
My hairpin leans on stone, my cap sits askew all day.
If someone asks where I make my abode,
I smile and point to the clouds where my home is bestowed.

*To Master Zhang on the Unity of the Dao*

The Great Dao is non-action, nature’s own way,
Through Chan’s semblance, true Chan comes to stay.
Nature fuses with form, beyond all divide,
Life knocks on yin and yang, where inversion and truth abide.

Wind stirs beneath my feet, my body wings the earth,
The moon shines at my head, my back grinds the sky’s girth.
Who would believe that from nothing, all things arise?
Phoenix and crane soar freely, needing no whip’s guise.

*Seeing Master Zhang Off to Shaanxi*

A recluse beyond the world is seldom met,
With joy in greeting, sorrow in parting—endless fret.
Your virtue’s light scatters like rain on Qin’s plain,
Your Dao’s qi lingers like wind in Jin’s domain.

Today we laugh and talk in shared delight,
In future times, who knows if we’ll reunite?
Beyond the clouds and mist, in the immortals’ land,
Will this old man of drifting fate still stand?

*Admonition Against Weariness of Worldly Toil*

Worldly toil should serve as awakening’s gate,
Yet toil itself breeds weariness and endless want’s weight.
Each act of crafting leaves the heart remorseful, sore,
A hundred thoughts bring hardship, grief to the core.

The seven po souls scatter with karmic seeds,
The three hun souls are stolen by sleep’s thieving deeds.
If you grasp this truth for cultivation’s art,
When will you ever board the Dharma’s ship to start?

*Exhortation to the Unawakened*

Before sealing the Five Passes, how can you refine the Nine Returns?
Vainly you fast to quell disputes, seek herbs to keep youth’s burns.
The Five Phases never leave yin and yang’s shell,
The Two Things are bound within creation’s spell.
If you comprehend the principle of non-action, formless and free,
You’ll find joy in idleness, neither near nor far from thee.

*Admonition Against Indulging in Books*

To gather dusty thoughts in furrowed brows is vain,
For gain and loss have ever been a forked lane.
A thousand ancient tomes the scholars may explain,
But only Daoists know the immortal’s scene’s domain.
In youth, experience the world’s affairs,
In prime, seek the Great Dao’s base.
I warn the clever: discern early, be wise,
Lest wit turn to folly in your eyes.

*Mourning Master Wei*

All day I mourn you, touching your cloud-coffin’s side,
At last you’ve realized the Perfect Truth’s pure guide.
The cicada sheds its golden husk, soars to the azure sky,
The crane returns to the purple palace, its jade nest cold on high.

Delighting in wind and moon above the three heavens’ height,
Your lofty standard stands for all to see through time’s long night.
I call again to the Daoist friends of Penglai’s isle,
Yet when we’ll meet again, who knows? The phoenix waits awhile.

*To Master Wang, Who Turned from the Dao to Scholarship*

You’ve pored over the Three Tombs, pondered the Nine Thoughts’ maze,
Yet in the end, your plans fell short, your toil brought scant praise.
Better to follow Confucius’ Four Dhyānas’ way,
Or honor Lü’s Hundred-Character Poem each day.

When the Seven Returns and Nine Cycles’ work is done,
When the Three Vehicles’ One Perfection’s course is run,
Beneath the azure sky, the bright moon clears the heart,
How I envy your success, your laurel branch’s art!

*Early Winter’s Feelings*

Autumn’s light has faded, winter follows fast,
The Northern Emperor’s work brings chill at last.
White grass fills the three paths, intertwined,
Crimson clouds darken as the six-petaled snow is twined.

Awaken to truth—alas, too late the call,
Begin to cultivate—too slow, the fall.
I sigh for the drifting red leaves’ flight,
For returning to the origin is like entering the kiln’s light.

*Snow*

The crimson clouds gather as if by fate,
The wind drives the flying snow to every state.
Reed banks and islets share the silver hue,
Wild trees and plum blossoms wear the same white view.

I begrudge Sun Gong’s night beyond the window pane,
I resent Han Qi’s snow before his horse’s mane.
By the tea’s warmth, the smoke curls, no other care,
I speak of immortal flowers on the leaves laid bare.

*On the Beginning and End of Cultivation*

Deluded disciples seek the Daoist’s way,
Refine pure yang to perfection, then stay.
A three-foot sack holds boundless delight,
A single staff sweeps all sorrow away.

Green mountains invite—dwell in ease,
Green waters beckon—roam with grace.
If a guest asks where my path leads,
I smile in silence, point to the clouds’ embrace.

**In Response to Wang Zhiyin’s "Early Spring"**

The alchemy of creation knows renewal’s art,
The cauldron’s fresh spring glows with radiant heart.
Warblers ascend to lofty boughs on soft breeze,
Swallows near nests find the sun’s slow reprise.

Half-rain, half-shine—peach blossoms bare their face,
Light chill, light warmth—willows unfurl with grace.
Each year we meet, each year we age anew,
For whom do white hairs toil, and fame accrue?

**Admonishing a Friend Moved by Spring**

Why grieve, my friend, at spring’s return in vain?
What sorrow lurks where spring’s own light doth reign?
Each year we greet, each year we bid adieu,
A hundred pass, and all must fade from view.

Old sins dissolve in verdant knots anew,
Lest future lives be lost to deeds we rue.
A hand’s span holds the bliss of paradise,
Yet few unlock its gates to wander twice.

**Heaven’s Dao in Harmonious Spring**

The Way unfolds in spring’s unhurried turn,
Heaven and Earth in balanced concord burn.
Roots gilded lie within the Five Phases’ mold,
Sprouts nurtured thrive where twin qi’s warmth is told.

Flutes trill in painted towers on whispers light,
Hooves clatter on purple paths through misted night.
Yet mark: all fruit succeeds the bloom’s embrace,
And strength is rooted deep in steadfast base.

**The Inexorable Push of Impermanence**

Grim specters drive, relentless in their claim,
A thousand gold won’t buy a fleeting name.
The rich will never bear the poor man’s plight,
Nor can tomorrow grasp today’s last light.

Deserted crimson towers, courtyards still,
Endless black mists at the ghostly gate’s chill.
Oh, how the bitter grief wells up anew—
All born from loves that once our hearts once knew.

**Admonition Against Wine**

Since ancient days, men curse old Du Kang’s brew,
Yet still they drink, though ruin it may strew.
It rots the liver, sears the lungs with pain,
Torments the gut—no cure, no balm, no gain.

It stirs the waves that drown the soul’s fair stream,
A scalding bath that shames the waking dream.
I urge you: drink, but never to excess,
For though it spares none, harm begins with self.

**Lament for Calamities of Flood and Drought**

When yin and yang in heaven’s breath misalign,
Mankind’s own sins the wrath of nature twine.
The poor dissemble, knaves deceive and cheat,
The rich grow wanton, nobles haughty greet.

Summer’s chill freezes, winter’s heat oppresses,
Rain turns to drought, and drought to barren stresses.
Famine breeds plague, yet heaven stays unkind,
No mercy shown for deeds of humankind.

**To Master Liu After Long Parting**

A decade passed since last your face I knew,
Yet longing lingers, etched in heart’s deep hue.
Though fine days come, old songs we may reprise,
No breeze now bears the verses I devise.

Though dreams may bring you near, words fail to reach,
Our bodies part, yet minds remain in each.
How oft at crossroads grief has torn my breast—
Soft spring winds blow, the sun lingers west.

**To Master Zhang**

You dwell in western hills, bound by duty’s chain,
No word from you, no crane-borne news to gain.
Body and mind drift like spring’s floating down,
Footsteps wander like autumn’s tumbling brown.

The Six Repositories stay pure, untouched by dust,
The Three Isles’ paths lie veiled in mist and rust.
Take one step on the clouds—lest slumber claim,
And time reduce you to a hoary frame.

**Early Summer Rain at Hejin**

Summer’s first rains enrich the farmer’s store,
No boast of plenty—yet abundance’s door.
Mulberry boughs half-crimson, fragrant, bright,
Cherries near ripe, cradled in crimson light.

Peppercorns swell in courtyards front and back,
Wheat blooms in fields both north and south’s expanse.
Through emerald willows, verdant locusts’ shade,
The spinning wheels hum on without a pause.

**Summer Day in a Mountain Hall**

The mountain hall lies still in summer’s deep,
A draught of coolness cleanses dust to sleep.
I loosen robes to sit on riverside stone,
Lean on my staff to walk where willows’ shade has grown.

I pluck wild blooms to lure the butterflies,
Strike bamboo hard to startle birds that rise.
Enthralled by clouds, I draw the boy’s mocking laugh—
Unseen, the sun now dips to western half.

**Passing the Days**

Drifting, drifting through the fleeting hours,
I seek no fame, nor chase the gnat-like powers.
By night, I tend the furnace’s threefold flame,
By dawn, I pluck the zither’s tranquil claim.

The cuckoo’s cry shatters the dream of Hua Xu,
The Qi maiden’s call rouses the meditative view.
Who knows the art of this unhurried life?
To forge white jade and mold it into gold.

**To Master Chen, the Preceptor**

Since parting, your abode seems lost in mist,
My thoughts take flight like crows to southern tryst.
Mists veil the winding streams in layered gray,
Clouds mirror peaks that rise and fall away.

The inkstone gathers dust, its sheen now dim,
No guests cross the gate, barred since dawn’s first hymn.
I shift my seat on rush mat, staff in hand,
Gaze north, stroke my beard, and long to ascend.

**Farewell to Marshal Shi**

Our bond was bright, our joy in life complete,
Yet honor’s weight and shame brought fear to meet.
Though weak my arm to steer the chariot’s wheel,
My throat still holds the rooster’s clarion peal.

In speech, we shared the fire of loyalty,
In word, our trust grew ever steadfastly.
I point to fine days, hoping we may meet,
But life and death deny our hearts’ deceit.

**Expressing My Feelings**

Why bow the head or bend the knee in vain?
Green hills and clouds—no distant path to gain.
Old pines defy the frost’s unyielding bite,
Uncut jade fears no furnace’s fierce light.

The cock’s crow carries three leagues’ sound,
The crane’s call pierces ninefold heaven’s ground.
Forgotten, fame and shame—what joy remains?
To hold the Dao, wear cap and crown, in silence reigns.

**Seeking Master Chen, the Preceptor Afar**

My soles grow calloused, drenched in sweat like rain,
Yet undeterred, I seek my friend again.
For righteousness, I’d bear a mountain’s weight,
For kindness, plumb the seas’ uncharted state.

The idler’s nature grinds the guest’s resolve,
The sage’s heart the sage’s heart evolves.
Upon the mat, the wind’s high price I pay—
One smile repays a debt of thousand gold.

**Warning: Power’s Transience**

Affairs of men know rise and fall’s decree,
Winter departs, spring comes eternally.
Waves churn to ripples, then disperse in air,
Clouds veil the rain, then hide the sun’s bright glare.

The future points—its term is nearly spent,
The past, once turned to, nowhere can be bent.
I lie and dream of east winds at noon’s height—
Awake, the red sun sinks in western light.

**Admonishing a Monk’s Arrogance**

Your laughter, monk, in robes, goes much too far,
Even if supreme—what then? What avatar?
With words you carve out pits and trenches deep,
With tongue you weave the nets that others keep.

The mirror’s tarnish lingers, still you stain,
The bag’s sharp awl is honed to cut again.
Though you may clutch the jade of Jing Mountain’s core,
Who dares to ask, lest none know its true lore?

**Self-Lament**

White-haired, capped, an old Daoist I remain,
Life’s grace has granted me a carefree reign.
Today I shun the shells of others’ guise,
Tomorrow I’ll be free—no need for lies.

At seventy, few survive; at sixty, rare,
Three thousand fruits of immortality—
Two thousand years to cultivate with care.

**Yesterday’s Errors, Today’s Truth**

Yesterday’s errors, today’s truth—life’s journey done,
Inspired, I sing; weary, I rest.

**Visiting a Friend on the Double Ninth in the Cold**

On the Double Ninth, wind stirs the leaves with a mournful sigh,
Cold’s bite pierces my tattered robe.
My flesh bristles with the chill’s sharp sting,
My teeth chatter as I chant poems to greet the noble.
I bear a thousand verses, deep in intent,
Yet he plucks not a single hair in return.
Worse still, reckless friends show no pity—
They rap my gate with staffs, calling me to climb the heights.

**Master Pei’s Transcendence**

Last night, golden youths bore a decree in my dream,
This morn, Master Pei ascends as an immortal.
His spirit, unbound, returns to truth,
His fourfold form, dignified, remains serene.
With dragon’s might, he leaps into the sea isles,
With crane’s strength, he soars to the heavens’ net.
From this day forth, cultivators of truth—
Few may stand beside him.

**Lamenting the End of Worldly Ambition**

Once I played the gallant, learned the ways of the world,
Now old, all things fade—nothing remains.
Fame and gain flow away like water,
Right and wrong are swept up with falling blossoms.
I grow weary of wind and moon, shun poetry circles,
Fear the madness of wine, avoid the taverns.
If guests speak of honor and disgrace,
I seal my lips and shake my head.

**Admonishing Disciples on My Aspirations**

Drunk on elixirs outside my thatched hut,
I wander a realm apart, proving my skill.
A crimson dragon I ride, steady through golden gates,
A dark crane supports me as I mount the jade flask.
When the myriad changes settle, the Three Realms grow still,
The nine heavens’ clear sun stands alone.
How many cultivators of truth know this?
Have they grasped this family’s way?

**Warning the World**

In troubled times, straight ministers’ plans go unused,
Knowing the glue-pot’s trap, why risk shaving your head?
Han, Marquis of Yunmeng, was slain though blameless,
Bai Qi of Du’ou was imprisoned despite his merit.
Beneath the green pines, temples stand high and low,
By fragrant grassy banks, new and old graves lie.
Look to the steles—observe their fates:
Not one meets the heart’s desire.

**Exhorting the Worldly to Know Their Limits**

The world’s eyes struggle to glimpse the Daoist’s path,
Yet within, a wondrous mechanism turns.
One loss: the bright moon, pure in mid-heaven,
Two gains: the spirit’s light, gathered within.
Hexagrams’ lines, long or short, mend and split,
Fire and water of bing and geng ebb and flow.
When spring thunder shakes the vast expanse,
The pure body roams freely to heaven’s end.

**Having Failed to Achieve Fame and Success**

I saw ambition would not bear fruit,
So I returned—honor and shame no longer surprise me.
Within, I gather my pupils, cease gazing at forms,
Without, I lock my tongue, make no sound.
My heart is still as a half-pole of pond water,
My body drifts like a wisp of wild cloud.
Recalling past affairs, I laugh to the sky—
Nearly trapped by empty blossoms for a lifetime.

**To My Disciples: The Master’s Study of Books**

Why does the master shun his thatched hut,
Shunning the Dao to cling to the Confucians?
Greedily he covets the Three Rites on his shelves,
Heedless of the seven treasures in his flask.
Fiercely he scolds those who seek glory and gain,
Unknowing of the effortless work of contention.
His aged frame, his ailing eyes draw near—
Surely he sighs, lamenting his folly.

**Admonishing the Stubborn**

To learn the Dao, first be steadfast and firm,
But stubbornness makes you a tyrant.
Xiangru yielded the road, forgetting his pride,
Lian Po bore the thorns, begging forgiveness.
Harmony’s gentlest breath pierces the earth,
A spring’s weak flow cuts through high ridges.
To be humble is to gain—never faulted,
To defy the crowd is to court great misfortune.

**Self-Delight**

I break earth’s net, strike heaven’s gate,
Ride a flying dragon at will.
My eyes know this as utmost bliss,
My seat reveals Penglai’s peak.
The sun and moon rush on, let them speed,
My true nature abides in tranquil ease.
What is done or undone—why heed it?
Let white hair laugh with abandon.

**Inquiring of My Daoist Brothers on the Dharma**

Ask not of your heart’s affairs—why fret?
To truly cultivate, you must meet truth.
Let the teaching rain wash the filth from your heart,
Let the Dao’s wind scatter the dust from your eyes.
One flask transforms dreams within dreams,
The Three Realms fly with bodies beyond bodies.
If you still doubt this mystery,
What else shall we call the yang spirit?

**Warning Against Delusion**

I sought the Dao, I studied Chan,
Wandered mountains and clouds, losing count of years.
Monks boast of their Buddha-seed,
Daoists prattle of immortals.
The Six Classics and Ten Treatises—mere words,
The seven returns and nine refinements—falsely transmitted.
Bound in this skin-bag’s prison,
They still speak of "before parents were born."

**To Lei Youzhi, Ill After the Great Army’s Retreat**

Heaven’s net is vast, its mesh secure—
Who finds lasting peace beneath its cover?
How many partings, how many regrets?
Each rise and fall leaves only emptiness.
On wind-swept paths, corpses still lie,
On rain-washed battlefields, blood remains red.
Ask the tiger-faced warriors of those years—
How many have lived to see white hair?

**Self-Admonition: Cherishing Life**

In chaotic times, in cruel years, I know well enough—
Withdraw your head, follow your lot, nurture true desire.
Once, there were countless youths,
Now, only one or two old reeds remain.
Life has no root—like a fish on a hook,
The body is bound—like a silkworm in its cocoon.
Fate’s rise and fall are fixed, without error,
Do not let greed deceive your heart.

**On the Dao**

The pearl of nature, formless, holds profound mystery,
Adapting freely, it moves with nature.
All directions are clear, utterly transparent,
All things are embraced, the body follows their patterns.
Hidden, it retreats to the infinitesimal,
Manifest, it fills heaven and earth.
It is but one unobstructed thing—
Its wondrous power knows no bounds.

**Admonishing Greed**

Greed’s coils bind the body—hear the sighs!
Only then do you know the earth’s snares bring harm.
Fear the needle before your eyes—cultivate thorns,
Dread the pit before your path—beware the trench.
Disaster is born from fools’ blessings,
Fortune arises from the wise amid calamity.
If heroes do not judge in secret,
Xiang Yu and King Wu would rise again.

**On the Perils of Delusion**

To speak of the profound’s inversions,
You must wander the heavens within the heavens.
If the heart still clings to things, do not discuss the Dao,
If nature has no root, do not speak of Chan.
The first stage does not plant lotuses in mud,
How then can the last bear water’s lilies?
Do not wildly guess at sacred texts—
Lest your body incur the sin of false speech.

**Song Master’s Teachings at the Yellow River**

Parting the clouds, he expounded widely among men,
Twice he returned to the Yellow River in a year.
His virtue’s light opened the nine hells,
His compassion’s power shook the three mountains.

**Breath and Pulse: The Alchemy of Yin and Yang**

Inhaling Kan, exhaling Li—yin and yang transform,
Wind and cloud unfurl and coil, heaven and earth at ease.
Let this be known to all the world hereafter:
Those who turn not toward goodness grow ever more foolish and stubborn.

**Night Sitting**

The long night deepens at the third watch,
My subtle form soars forth from Jade Capital.
Wild clouds rejoice, a thousand miles of purity,
Moonlight spills like a full wheel’s brilliance.
Silver stars dot the frosty gleam,
The azure river runs clear, vast qi serene.
Why does the sun-crow leave the sea at dawn?
A single bell’s toll startles the first meditation.

**Realm of Joy**

The profound Dao lies within inward vision,
Bland as if tasteless, yet true joy abides.
A pure breeze carries qi beyond the three mountains,
Bright moonlight flies, illuminating ten thousand miles.
Unconstrained, I ascend to transformations,
What need to distinguish inner from outer in this blissful roaming?
Awakened, to whom could I speak alone?
All is entrusted to the pine winds’ plucked melody.

**The Dao Is Not Two**

Buddhism and Daoism share one source from the beginning,
Tathāgata and Laozi ascend heaven together.
An arrow pierces the iron drum, concealing deep principle,
The furnace refines golden elixir, veiling supreme mystery.
The white horse arrives bearing secret teachings,
The blue ox strides west, expounding true meaning.
Yet now, in this age, the black-robed and yellow-capped
Vainly pore over cinnabar texts and Buddhist scriptures.

**In Praise of Knowing Advance and Retreat**

At leisure, I point backward to instruct the heroic:
Xiang Yu and King Liu—one move too high.
Three scrolls of sacred writ held secrets at Gaixia,
A single divine stratagem enabled escape at Kuaiji.
Xi Shi’s coquetry ensnared the roc’s net,
Empress Lü’s schemes emptily trapped the tiger’s den.
Small wit scheming great affairs
Is like fish bait seeking to hook the whale.

**Answering One Who Asks About Leisure**

Having admired the forests and springs’ carefree ease,
I take up bowl and staff to companion green mountains.
Three scrolls—*Yinfu*, *Daode*, and *Scripture*—
Two rooms—door of reeds, window of mulberry.
Spirit birds of the Purple Palace diligently ferry me,
The leisurely chariot of Cinnabar Mountain swiftly follows.
At peace, my heart holds no lingering affairs,
Pine winds fill the courtyard as I close the gate at noon.

**Visiting the Tombs of Immortals Zhao and Bai with Reverence**

Late at night, incense coils from the precious stove,
Facing the mounds, I lay bare my liver to supplicate the two masters.
Eight hundred deeds of cultivation—on what day were they perfected?
Three thousand merits of toil—at what hour were they completed?
Within the world, Penglai’s isles remain hard to glimpse,
Beyond the world, the heavens’ net is not easily known.
I pray to enter dreams for clear revelation,
To cast aside this body and await the return to the Dao.

**Yin Cong Entrusts His Tomb and Asks About Conduct**

With reverent heart, I light a stove of incense before the mound.
Thirty years of steadfast poverty, trembling through countless trials.
In motion and stillness, sitting and lying—my hundred bones age,
In roaming, resting, concealing, and cultivating—my temples frost.
One move toward non-being remains unfinished,
Disloyal and unfilial—whose sin is this?

**Met with Rejection by Others**

Carrying a twin staff, a body like a wisp of cloud,
I’ve drifted the world’s edges for twenty springs.
Green temples once sought the *Cantong* with great benefit,
Now, silver-haired, I return home—no neighbors near.
Will vermilion gates deign to glance at a thatched-door guest?
Who pities the fox-fur-clad man in coarse hemp?
The immortal isles of the sea remain beyond reach,
I endure both stretching and bending, nurturing natural truth.

**Delighting in Poverty**

The fourth watch’s drum fades, the market’s clamor stills,
I sleep soundly, carefree in my humble state.
A scrap of paper covers a stone pillow,
A rush mat spreads over a mound of silk floss.
Sometimes I follow white cranes to Penglai’s isles,
Suddenly I ride a vermilion dragon to peer into grotto-heavens.
Such words are hard to speak in the world of men—
Vainly do fame and profit mock the wind-tossed madman.

**Mid-Autumn Moon Gazing**

Clouds disperse, dust settles—half the autumn sky,
Stars and constellations distinct, the moon perfectly round.
Who plays the flute atop the white jade tower?
Within the crystal palace, I tune my strings.
Luminous as floating ice over sea and peaks,
Its light immerses heaven and earth in crystalline clarity.
Since ancient times, only this night each year—
Where in the world do men not stay up late?

**To Prefect Li of Pingyang**

The people wail, their suffering unbearable,
Yet when a great official passes, their cold turns to warmth.
Gentle words soothe customs, adding to winter’s quilts,
Virtue’s moisture nourishes the thirsty like sweet broth.
Wherever he goes, no harsh winds or rains,
Everywhere his name sprays the fragrance of musk and orchid.
His flowing influence spares the vermilion gates from fear,
They hear only the thunderous sound of imperial favor’s light.

**Seeing Off Wang Jinzhi**

Parting cups shimmer, sending off a dear friend,
Grasping hands, sorrow spills tears upon our robes.
Narrow paths and perilous bridges demand caution,
Amid chaotic mountains and lone inns, guard your heart.
Crimson leaves of fading glow stretch to distant hamlets,
Dawn’s light and crisp frost deepen the wild fields.
Staff and sandals wander cloud and water’s vast expanse,
When will our emotions again seek the ant’s incense?

**Admonishing Master Yang**

With you, I speak especially of conduct and concealment:
The Dao resides in pure poverty—stand firm.
Tightly seal the five passes, and the body benefits,
Carefully uphold the three treasures, and your path is unimpeded.
Recommending the worthy and praising the good brings double beauty,
Comforting yourself while slandering others must wound both.
What the noble man does is worth emulating—
Naturally, fortune’s vines will stretch to the heavens.

**The Daoist’s Actions Are Extraordinary**

Virtue must be humble, will must be steadfast.
The wisdom-blade swings high, demons flee,
The elixir pellet glows, myriad evils hide.
Within the five-hued cauldron, golden medicine simmers,
In the seven-jeweled furnace, jade nectar refines.
True cultivation of creation forges a robust body,
The path through heaven and earth stands majestic.

**Lamenting the Times**

Departing the dust for the Dao, do not let your heart stray,
Heaven and earth shift, the world changes.
Petty men grow ever more cunning with each passing day,
The modest gentleman’s Dao dwindles in this age.
Ashen-hearted, he yields the seal after three pleas,
Ice-lipped, he declines gold, fearing the four who know.
Mostly, leave the threads of karma unheeded—
Better to sit like a clod, delighting in non-action.

**Inducing the Multitude**

The art of immortal study holds wondrous mechanisms,
All within the questions of creation’s becoming.
Water and fire shift—meet and return,
Wood and metal move—encounter and revert.
A single wheel of sun and moon, yin and yang’s breath,
The six directions of heaven and earth lie at ease.
Master this practice,
And you will know Penglai’s peaks arise everywhere.

**Admonishing Disciples**

Tongue sharp, heart stubborn—students of the Dao,
I urge and warn you: do not give way to anger.
Youth’s spring silently departs, year by year you age,
White hair stealthily arrives, day by day it renews.
Love and attachment add grime to the heart,
Glory’s sights gather dust in the eyes.
One morning, original truth dissipates entirely,
Prostrate on your pillow, you’ll vainly sigh for the distant Dao.

**Warning Against Wasted Years**

Back then, I angled for you—why did you not turn your head?
Even if you turn now, cultivation is still delusion.
Seeking fish in trees, toiling dawn to dusk,
Catching the moon in water, passing spring and autumn.
At that time, had you angled and not turned away,
Though you turn now, cultivation remains in vain.
Fishing in trees from dawn to dusk,
Grasping at the moon in water through the seasons.

**On the Fleeting Nature of Life**

Honors and humiliations in darkness and light—brief as dreams,
How much sorrow in the stench of the divine, the withering of glory?
Wipe the bronze mirror, behold the hoary hair:
This year it thickens more than the last.

The tattered robe—threadbare, not a single seam holds,
Seek its warp and weft, and none can be worn.
Four seams square as the four apertures, round as the round,
Two sleeves long and dangling, then short again.
Wash away the grime—strip by strip it follows the water,
Brush off the dust—flake by flake it chases the wind’s crest.
Now I sleep in moonlight, nestle in clouds,
Utterly bare, I pass my late years.

**Warning Against Misinterpreting the *Yuanjue Sutra***

The true *Yuanjue Sutra* cannot be spoken,
Forced discourse on it wastes effort.
Empty *yuanjue* leaves no trace,
Great awakening’s perfection defies all models.
Drowning and surfacing—vain gathering and scattering,
Clouds come and go—endless chasing.
Know that silence is the truest speech,
Yet none dare spread their mats before others.

**Night Sitting in Liaoyang Palace**

Alone I sit in Liaoyang as night deepens,
The Silver River gleams cold, the moon’s light chills.
The zither plays "Breaking the Cassia"—the Moon Goddess listens,
The sword dances to slay dragons—ghosts and demons watch.
Eight-sided and clear as ice, the mirror’s expanse,
One sky serene as a jade flask, boundless.
How many worldly men chase profit and fame?
They know not the gourd and ladle that cradle the Great Elixir.

**Warning Against Misreading Books**

Wild guesses and reckless interpretations deceive in discourse,
Failing to recognize the true, constant Dao’s root.
Scooping mud from the road to wipe a pile of dung,
Rinsing a glue pot with lacquered water.
Zhang Liang points to Meng Liang’s uncle,
Yangzi calls them the descendants of Liuzi.
They aspire to ascend the hall and enter the chamber,
Yet how many gates still lie between?

**Admonition to Daoists: Leave Your Hometown**

For cultivation, it is crucial to leave your homeland,
Without traversing cloud-capped mountains, the Dao is hindered.
Moonlight reaches the sky—utterly bright,
Water flows to the sea—naturally vast.
Willow fluff drifts south and north,
The ant and snail abandon their quarrels over length.
With no firewood beneath the cauldron, the flame dies of itself—
Why labor to stir boiling water?

**Warning Against Private Schemes in the Hermitage**

Do not rejoice too much in joy, nor grieve too much in sorrow,
This six-foot frame is but a bubble on water.
Today’s joy—rejoice today,
Tomorrow’s sorrow—grieve tomorrow.
One breath unpassed, and you are rotting bones,
Half a speck of skin stinks—a skeleton.
The sages’ teachings feign deafness and blindness,
Willingly serving as horses and oxen for children and grandchildren.

**Warning Against Reckless Cultivation**

To study the Dao, one must refine jade and gold,
The true breath of Heaven’s origin runs deep.
Seek not at the root’s fixed stem,
Nor vainly chase the blossoms’ empty tips.
Focus *qi*, preserve essence—fill the belly,
Embrace the origin, guard the One—empty the heart.
How many suffer from wakeful illness,
Yet refuse to administer a single needle’s cure?

**Warning to Qin Zhongnan and Shu Yongle**

The yellow root’s dream ends—teachings become the foundation,
Clouds point to Chongyang as the patriarch.
A thousand *li* to Zhongnan, the heart rejoices to go,
Yet a single journey to Yongle, the feet grow weary.
Truth is seen only after the flowers,
The root precedes the sprout—so it has ever been.
The old folk rhyme now proves true:
Only then does one know—layer by layer, skin upon skin.

**Resting in the Pure Yang Palace on a Summer Day**

Who does not dread the scorching summer sun?
The meditation couch, the pine wind—cool and refreshing.
Tea and milk fill the cup, clear dew glistens,
Sandalwood smoke curls into a canopy, white clouds fragrant.
Within nature, form and emptiness merge,
Beyond the heart, worldly toil is forgotten in sitting.
Gazing outward, the ridges of Tiaoshan—clouds scatter,
The sun shifts, flower shadows climb the eastern wall.

**Admonition to Liu Zigao**

The Daoist’s bearing is distinct, his conduct steadfast,
Unashamed to wear a threadbare, patched robe all his life.
Beyond the world, he fixes his heart on friends beyond the world,
In the world, he engages with those of the world.
His will must be as yielding as the waters of Linzhou,
His *qi* must rise like Mount Taihua’s heights.
Dare I ask of later words—do not retreat or falter,
For I have sworn to use the fish’s bait to hook the whale and leviathan.

**Escaping the Heat at the Stork and Sparrow Tower**

Atop the Stork and Sparrow Tower, the heat does not reach,
A gentle southern breeze pierces the heart’s field.
Dust and earth—each grain falls away,
A thousand *li* of mountains and rivers come before the eyes.
Lying down, I drink the pure wind—my heart drunk on the Dao,
Sitting in forgetfulness, the turbid realm—my nature at peace in meditation.
The hues of Zhongtiao Mountain half in fading light,
Crimson and green intertwine, threading the evening mist.

**Wandering the Mountain Hermitage**

The secluded mountain hermitage veiled in mist,
Clouds seal the hidden path, water flows east and west.
After rain by the stream, monkeys pluck fruit,
In the sun-warmed pines, cranes preen in the wind.
The old man tends herbs in the garden plots,
Children play at gathering lingzhi beneath the boulders.
One day, I’ll cast aside worldly affairs,
Exhale rainbow breath, return to the Great Void.

**Reflections in Old Age**

White hair and a scholar’s cap—nothing suits me now,
Daily I sleep late, rise even later.
Moon waxing and waning—how many times have I seen it?
Who is humbled, who is honored—I know not.
Idle talk of the noble man’s words,
Wild chanting of the Daoist’s poems beyond the world.
A lifetime unconcerned with the floating life’s reckoning,
Beyond this non-action—nothing is done.

**Warning Against Greed and Abuse of Power**

Unreasonable greed runs to excess,
The heart’s nets and snares bitterly ensnare.
Heat and cold still shift with the four seasons,
Day and night still follow the solstices.
Filling the sea—Xufu’s efforts crumble to laughter,
Moving mountains—Zifang’s strength is spent in song.
Do not say success and failure are man-made,
When the tally is done—what can be done?

**Warning Against Blind Study**

The Dao relies on a bright teacher’s guidance to the end,
Yet others’ cases are still sought out.
To ascend to heaven, one must borrow the ascent lamp,
To cross the sea, one must rely on the crossing boat.
All things arise from their origin,
Grass waves ripple from their source.
How pitiful—the ant’s admiration of blind cultivation,
The mad swallow’s frenzied play in the mirage’s tower.

**Returning Home**

In years past, I wandered east and west in search of the Dao,
Today, gourd and ladle return to my village.
I can but roll up my ambitions, hide my striving,
I cannot bear to speak of poverty and success.
Human feelings—warm and cool, fragrant and distinct,
Worldly affairs—rise and fall, ever changing.
How many in fox-fur and sable hats?
At Ba Ling, their news—still puffed with arrogance.

**Admonition to Disciples: Embrace Labor**

Do not shirk the toil of worldly dust—it accumulates blessings,
To rise high, one must take the low as foundation.
Activities do not hinder heaven and earth’s union,
Movement does not obstruct the sun and moon’s course.
The four *dhyānas* of *yuanjue* settle in sequence,
The three thieves of the *Yinfu* naturally align.
One truth, unwavering from beginning to end,
Over time, within the void, a child is nurtured.

**Mid-Autumn Night**

The wind parts the cloud curtain—mid-autumn arrives,
I pull a friend, carry the zither, feast in the small tower.

**Mid-Autumn Night (continued)**

Incense ash fills the censer, adding to the tiled burner,
Reed blinds roll high, hung on silver hooks.
Delighted to behold the full moon’s face,
How could it stir even half a trace of sorrow?
Drunk on the western wind, self and other forgotten,
With eyes unparted, I gaze upon Penglai’s isles.

**Presented to Recorder Zhao**

The constant Dao—non-action, mysterious and wondrous,
Yet worldly folk cling to its fringes, seeking signs.
Lost currents branch, obscuring the true source;
A steadfast will cuts through crookedness to grasp the essential.
The superior person hears it, believes, and acts,
While the foolish, even when told, scoff and mock.
Thus, I cast my hook into the vast waves,
Knowing the great turtle’s bait is hard to take.

**Upper Scroll of *Awakening to Reality* concludes**

**Lower Scroll of *Awakening to Reality***

**Collected Works of Master Li, the Master of Mystical Communication of Mount Brocade Screen**

**Poems**

**Exhortation to Cultivate the Dao: Leave Home Early**

Cultivation need not take you far from kin and love—
It is for this life’s debts of mud and water.
Originally formed by mud and water,
In the end, you’ll be ruined by mud and water.

**The Master Who Would Not Permit (the Fisherman)**

Adrift on the bitter sea, longing to hook the turtle,
Yet seeing it, dare not cast the line.
Alas! A single surge capsizes the boat,
Waves churn higher in the raging wind.

**Inward Gaze: The Moon of the Heart**

One’s own palace halls stretch boundless as the sky,
High hangs the full white jade disk.
Bright and pure, its radiance free of shadows,
Behind deep curtains, it may be gazed upon at will.

**Taming the Monkey**

In the mountains of the Red Emperor, a black-furred ape,
Climbing flowers, plucking fruit—hard to restrain.
Now, struck with the Vajra’s rope,
It is bound in the Yellow Court, head never raised.

**Tethering the Horse**

The crimson steed of the numinous terrace grows too proud and fat,
Loving to neigh in the wind and beneath the moon.
Fortunately, the land is at peace, no battles to fight—
Tightly tethered to the old trough, it is not led to ride.

**Question: Why Not Leave the Hermitage for Even a Moment?**

A retreat’s livelihood—home of earth and self,
With care, I craft three chariots.
Carving through ancient ruts, passing Kunlun’s peaks,
The great Dao flows unimpeded, without hindrance.
Painfully drinking the elixir, watering jade blossoms,
Drunk, I sleep as the sun slants west.
Guests come, knocking at the gate again and again,
Yet in a dream of wandering immortals, I have not yet returned.

**The Realm Within the Gourd**

Within heaven, another heaven—rarely known,
The true realm of non-birth is its foundation.
The Daoist has roamed within this very space—
Ask not of cultivation, of non-action, or of effort.

**Trying the Brush**

Hand and heart forget each other, the jade brush sways,
Its sound like cold rain, rustling and clear.
Not departing from a few sheets of cocoon paper,
It writes out dragons and serpents by the thousands.

**Spring Sorrow**

People suffer endlessly with spring’s arrival,
Yet casually, it climbs my brow with ease.
I ponder: white hair, pitiless in its ways,
Adds itself without asking its master.

**Visiting Prefect Yuan**

After autumn rains, the dawn wind sighs,
Probing my thoughts, I test my robe for chill.
Small wealth nears completion, approaching great wealth—
The brushwood gate remains closed as I seek the vermilion door.

**Against Slander and Arrogance**

Ten thousand cares sink, one qi surges,
Dawn and dusk, ever in the boundless void.
When others speak to me, I grow weary of words—
Seeing through all, I know every matter is empty.

**Mistaken Recognition**

Seek not the Buddha in halls of sound and form,
Nor search for immortals in fragrant grottoes.
Observe the monkey groping the moon in the waves—
Only when the reflection stirs do you know it is not the sky.

**Snow**

Clouds rise, wind carries snow in flurries—
Who recognizes the workings of heaven and earth’s creation?
Before the jade-green peaks, the boy laughs:
The black ox has turned into a white ox and returned.

**Dreaming of Drinking**

Weary of zither and books, in the small pavilion,
I dream of following Liu and Ruan to drink in Peach Blossom Spring.
Awake, I drink again; drunk, I wake once more—
Silent and still, no one but the dawn gibbons cry.

**A Friend Visits**

Yesterday, a good friend came in waxed sandals,
At dusk, I returned from the riverbank, carefree and smiling.
The woodcutter boy attended me as I sat by the stream—
Even without composing new poems, it was joy enough.

**Nurturing Aspiration**

Gathering zither and books, I return home,
The crane’s feathers are whole, the clam has formed its shell.
Soaring through the sky’s rivers without hindrance,
I proudly display the divine pearl, dazzling the nine dusts.

**Admonition on Mourning the Dead**

The foul transforms into the divine, the divine into the foul,
In the wheel of rebirth, the old becomes new again.
Knowing well the nature of things is thus,
Why do the living send off the dead?

**Dwelling in the Mountains**

I have coiled my traces in this thatched hut for years,
Casually, I do nothing before the mountain.
Do not say idleness is not of my choosing—
It is the human heart that clings to ten thousand illusions.

Peaks on the roof mirror the setting sun,
Half the forest’s red and emerald encircle the thatched hall.
After tea, guests depart, the brushwood gate is closed—
Idly, I play with the flowing spring in the evening chill.

**Parting from Hejin, Harmonizing with Master Ma’s Rhymes**

Joyfully lodged in the mountain hut, uncertain of return,
The migrating geese call, stirring thoughts of home.
Now that I have attained the joy of carefree wandering,
I intend to learn from the solitary cloud, flying freely.

The Daoist’s heart is as idle as the white clouds,
Movement and stillness, at ease and unhurried.
Recalling the time to leave the valley, I left the valley;
To return to the mountain, I return to the mountain.

**Lamenting Life and Death**

Do not grieve for the dead corpse over the living one—
The father departs, and soon the son follows.
The ledger of the shades is clearly limited,
Only the timing of the tally—early or late—is contested.

**Moonlit Night**

The wind gathers the cloud curtain, revealing the blue sky,
Heaven and earth—an ice flask, clear and bright.
Ten thousand sparse stars, the Silver River faint,
A single wheel of the bright moon, perfectly round and alone.

**Yang Fire**

Yang light ascends, piercing another heaven,
Below, it reaches boundlessly to the ninefold barriers.
Stars and moon hide, yin demons vanish—
A single wheel blazes, solitary and round.

**Herding the Ox**

The cowherd sings at dusk by the river,
Releasing the white ox, he does not lead it.
Beyond the reeds, in the mist and water,
A single wheel of the bright moon shines on the blue sky.

**Self-Joy**

Externally, no afflictions; internally, no thoughts,
Neither drunk nor sober, neither near nor far.
Why is the Daoist heart clear and joyful?
When the blue sky’s wind is gentle and the moon bright.

**Ignorance of the True Heart**

All speak of cultivating the heart, yet none know the heart—
The true heart hides deep in the grotto-heaven.
If you wish to know, ask not the cultivator of reality—
He has traversed the ends of the earth without finding it.

**Sent to Master Yang**

When the great Dharma hall bestowed the sword,
You were charged to entrust it to a true man.
Alas! How did it fall into the hands of the weak?
Its sorrowful cries within the scabbard—who can know?

**Exhortation to Study**

The primordial qi of heaven is the ladder to the sky,
Gather and cultivate it—you must know this clearly.
Mastering it from beginning to end without weariness,
Only the timing of success—early or late—is contested.

**Against Greed and Pursuit**

Chasing the fly’s-head profit with all one’s might,
Heedless of others’ hardship, careless of the four knowings.

A Day’s Accumulation Becomes a Sin of Full Measure
To whom shall the karmic debt be repaid?

**Admonition Against Summoning Future Misfortune**
Nine-tenths of loyal words miss their mark,
To one’s face they feign compliance, behind one’s back they turn to demons.
Fan Li awakened in time and escaped later calamity,
Fuchai saw only the shame of Wu Zixu.

**Despising Fame and Profit**
Return, come away—snow crowns your head,
The heart’s craving for fame and profit suddenly ceases.
Seizing the moment to settle the debt of rebirth,
This life, at least, gains one move ahead.

**Secluded Dwelling**
Balustrades of several stalks of gentlemanly bamboo,
Low windows with a few scrolls of the Sage’s books.
The dream of roaming immortals breaks as pine shadows shift,
One strum of the zither brings more than enough joy.

**Inner Skill**
Blowing red, a furnace of fire at the sea’s bottom,
Melting away two sheets of ice atop the mountain.
When the fire extinguishes itself, the ice vanishes of itself,
Sunlight and moonlight together shine in perfect clarity.

**Lament for the Treasure of the Dao**
Forging and shaping the great unhewn jade is one’s livelihood,
Its radiance illumines past and present without blemish.
Let it go, draw it back—the cosmos grows narrow,
Its towering spiritual use knows no bounds.

**Later Tuning the Zither**
Casually tuning the zither at leisure,
Sitting close to the brazier’s fire, freely at ease.
Enamored of the crystalline melodies beyond the frets,
Heedless of the unmelted snow at the gate.

**Daytime Repose**
Daytime slumber in the bright window—what bliss,
Not a speck of dust or care lingers in the heart.
Sweetly half-awakened from a dream of roaming immortals,
Once more he gazes into the Gourd Heaven.

**Traveling to Hezhong Prefecture After War**
Shun’s capital, its towers and pavilions once the finest under heaven,
How many times reduced to ashes, how many times rebuilt?
Only the foothills of Mount Tiao remain,
Majestic as ever, passing through spring and autumn.

**Western Pavilion of Liaoyang Palace**
The western pavilion stands high, its nature hazy,
Drunk on the western wind, merging with the vastness of space.
How many true transformations occur within the void?
Joyfully entrusted, unspoken.

Far from the clamor of the western pavilion, distant from the city’s bustle,
The boundless Dharma realm I deeply cherish.
When visitors from noble houses arrive, I am too weary to engage,
Alone, I claim the title of idle one, feasting in seated meditation.

In the western pavilion, clouds rest as I pillow my head on books and sleep,
A tiled censer with mountain incense wafts auspicious smoke.
A single pure note pierces the ear,
The jade zither, stirred by the wind, rings out of its own accord.

**Ascending the Stork Tower to View the River**
On earth, the long river; beneath heaven, the mountains,
Heaven’s wrath stirs the waves into tumultuous return.
How much better the nameless guest upon the tower,
Unmoved by wind or wave, at ease in idleness.

**Summer Evening Inspiration**
From the southern breeze, evening’s chill arises,
Ragged robes spread, zither laid across, facing the setting sun.
Three refrains fade as the bright moon rises,
A young servant comes to invite me for the evening incense burning.

**After the First Rain of the Sacrificial Offering**
Sweet rain clears at dawn, the days grow long,
A light chill still restrains the fragrant herbs.
To whom can one speak of the Dao’s joy in such scenes?
Alone, I stand defiantly in the east wind, bathed in evening sunlight.

**Early Morning at the Mouth of Liaoyang Terrace**
Several chimes of the golden bell dispel the morning chill,
The dream of roaming immortals breaks—I cannot sleep.
Rising, I gaze at the moon atop Mount Taihua’s peak,
Its slanting light immerses the shadow of Mount Tiao in the sky.

**Wen the Scholar Inquires About the Dao**
The constant Dao is ever self-knowing,
Knowing the constant, the Dao is non-action.
Non-action attains what cannot be spoken,
To speak of the true and constant is to depart from the Dao.

**Sent to Master Ren of Shannan**
A decade of silence since our parting in worldly talk,
How often have I seen wild geese linger in their comings and goings?
Gazing until the wind and moon at the mountain’s edge fade,
I imagine you, too, nurturing your lofty leisure in the same way.

**Presented to Master Zhang Entering the Garden**
Restrain body and foot to diligently practice the Dao,
Forget appearances and words to feast in seated meditation.
Great awakening, perfect penetration, illuminating the five eyes,
Not departing from the present—this is the net of heaven.

**Lament for the Hastening of Sun and Moon**
Just past Mid-Autumn, the bright moon full,
Again comes the Double Ninth, the chrysanthemum’s season.
The four seasons tirelessly hasten one’s aging,
Stitching together one year after another.

**Admonition Against Mourning**
Life and death at dawn and dusk—no mistake in this,
Long life or short, all is a dream of Nanke.
Facing the deceased, do not stir thoughts of sorrow and grief,
When it comes to your own turn, what can you do?

**Revisiting Hezhong**
Forty years ago, I wandered this place,
How many times has its splendor changed through spring and autumn?
The Yellow River cares not for the rise and fall of mortal shells,
As ever, it surges and flows eastward.

**Evening Stroll in Seclusion**
Hemp robe sweeping the ground, slender stalks tall,
Treading through cloud-capped mountains as the evening sun sets.
Turning back at dusk, incense and lamps extinguished,
Laughing, I part the wind and moon to enter the meditation chamber.

**Lament for Those Who Harm Others**
The cicada’s clamor on the pine branch shows no end,
The mantis’s claws and teeth are sharp as hooks.
Its heart set only on the sweet taste of the cicada,
How could it heed the oriole lurking behind?

**Clearly Guarding One’s Lot**
In this life, no grand deeds,
Endowed with a nature too foolish.
One bowl of rice from a thousand households,
Three winters in a hundred-patched robe.
In all things, ever content,
In every matter, never furrowed brow.
Why is poverty so steadfast?
The Primordial Origin speaks of frugality and compassion.

**Praising Poverty on the Journey to Establish a Hermitage in Hejin in Autumn**
Straw hat and rain cape, leaving mulberry and catalpa,
The season of frosted leaves has come.
Zither and books cast aside, my companions,
Bowl and alms-bowl, I seek other worthies.
Frost invades the tiled bed,
Rain drips from the crumbling eaves.
Tiger and wolf tracks outside the door,
Moss carpets the window.
Walking, I marvel at the lane of Yan Yuan,
Sleeping, I nestle in the wool of Hou Ji.
Scarcely a dragon-tail inkstone,
Shelves bare of crow’s-head planks.
Dipping a worn brush,
Grinding thick ink from a broken inkstick.
Inspired, I compose the biography of Yuan Xian,
At leisure, I peruse the writings of Fan Dan.
Not resenting others’ deep generosity,
Ever mindful of my own meager virtue.
Firm in poverty, my heart does not waver,
Embracing the Dao, my resolve grows stronger.
Sitting in profound obscurity,
Meditating in silent stillness.
This illusory body nurtures the chamber of a fathom’s depth,
My true nature pierces the layers of mystery.
Within and without, fused as one,
Throughout the vast cosmos, all is filled.
The five phases cannot alter creation,
The two qi cease their pressing urgency.
The realm of utmost joy and purity,
A carefree, self-so immortal.
The wondrous mechanism defies description,
Sealed lips await heaven’s appointed years.

**Admonition to Disciples**
In cultivation, do not be blind,
Devote yourself with purity and sincerity.
Though heaven may collapse, do not fear,
Though earth may split, do not be startled.
Below, forget poverty and lowliness,
Above, hold nobles in disdain.
Amidst clamor, seize stillness,
Within death, escape life.
Internally, preserve the pure body,
Externally, sever worldly ties.
Perfectly illuminate the five eyes,
Attain the fruit of the three vehicles.
These words I repeat as exhortation,
My brothers, my kin.
The phoenix soars in true flight,
The lame turtle lags behind.
Flattery to one’s face, slander behind one’s back,
Wealth prized over righteousness.
Delighting in the antics of apes,
Mimicking the squabbles of chickens.
Nature ensnared by sound and beauty,
Intent fixed on fame and achievement.

**Inquiry to You, in Earnest**
What, pray, do you seek in your journey ahead?

**Ode on Leaving the World**
Men heed the clear notes of the horn,
Yet turn deaf to thunder’s roar.
Now I depart—
The great limit nears its end.
Good deeds I would speak of,
Yet speech finds no belief.
My brothers, my kin,
Press onward in the Dao.
