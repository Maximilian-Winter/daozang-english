**The Master of Chongyang Teaches the Twenty-Four Precepts of Danyang**
*Composed by Chongyangzi Wang Zhuang (重陽子王壮) of Mount Zhongnan (終南山)*

Master Ma of Danyang (馬丹陽) asked Chongyang Ancestor (重陽祖師):
*"What are the teachings on the **Daoist Ancestors (祖宗)**, **life and essence (性命)**, **root and foundation (根蒂)**, **Dragon and Tiger (龍虎)**, **lead and mercury (鉛汞)**, **sword and needle (刀圭)**, **Jin Gong and Huang Po (金公黃婆)**, **Infant and Maiden (嬰兒姹女)**, **Dragon and Serpent (龍蛇)**, **mind-monkey and thought-horse (心猿意馬)**, **guest and host awareness (賓主覺照)**, **the Supreme Daoist (太上)**, **the Three Treasures (三寶)**, **the Nine Stars (九星)**, **the Five Firmnesses (五剛)**, **the Three Talents (三才)**, **adjusting fire and refining (抽添火候)**, **golden elixir (金丹)**, **transcending the Three Realms (出離三界)**, **seven returns (七返)**, and **moving, standing, sitting, lying (行住坐臥)**?"*

The Ancestor replied:
*"**Ancestor (宗)** is **essence (性)**. **Ancestor (祖)** is **life (命)**. Together they are called **Daoist Ancestors (祖宗)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"Why is it called **seeing life and essence (見性命)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Essence (性)** is the **original spirit (元神)**, **life (命)** is the **original qi (元氣)**. Together they are called **life and essence (性命)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"Why is it called **root and foundation (根蒂)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Root (根)** is **essence (性)**; **foundation (蒂)** is **life (命)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What are the **Dragon and Tiger (龍虎)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Dragon (龍)** is **spirit (神)**, **Tiger (虎)** is **qi (氣)**. They are **life and essence (性命)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What are **Jin Gong and Huang Po (金公黃婆)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Jin Gong (金公)** is the **heart (心)**, **Huang Po (黃婆)** is the **spleen (脾)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What are **Infant and Maiden (嬰兒姹女)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Infant (嬰兒)** is the **liver (肝)**, **Maiden (姹女)** is the **lung (肺)**. Together they are called **Infant and Maiden (嬰兒女姹)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **mind-monkey and thought-horse (心猿意馬)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Mind-monkey (心猿)** is the **heart (心)**, **thought-horse (意馬)** is the **will (意)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **guest and host awareness (賓主覺照)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"The **guest (賓)** is **life (命)**, the **host (主)** is **essence (性)**. To discern the true and false is **awareness (覺照)**—it is the innate clarity and wisdom within oneself that is **awareness (覺照)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What are **Dragon and Serpent (龍蛇)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Dragon (龍)** is **essence (性)**, the **kidneys (腎)**. **Serpent (蛇)** is the **refined vital essence (嘉炁)** within the heart, which does not depart from **essence (性)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What are the **Three Treasures (三寶)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"There are **inner and outer Three Treasures**. The **outer Three Treasures (外三寶)** are the **Daoist scriptures (道經)**, **precepts (經師)**, and **teachers (師)**. The **inner Three Treasures (內三寶)** are **jing (精)**, **qi (氣)**, and **shen (神)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **the Supreme Daoist (太上)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"The **Supreme (太)** is the **ultimate greatness (大之極)**; the **Daoist (上)** is the **highest and most profound (至重高之極)**. Together they are called **the Supreme Daoist (太上)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **out of the household (出家)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"To be **out of the household (出家)** is to stand amidst a sea of green without being obscured, to rely solely on one’s **innate luminosity (靈明)**. This is **out of the household (出家)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **cultivation and practice (修行)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"**Cultivation (修)** is the **Dao of the true body (真身之道)**, **practice (行)** is **life and essence (性命)**. Together they are called **cultivation and practice (修行)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **eternal life and immortality (長生不死)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"It is when **true essence (真性)** remains undisturbed, **all attachments (萬緣)** are not entangled, and one neither departs nor lingers. This is **eternal life and immortality (長生不死)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **the Dao (道)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"The **root essence of life and essence (性命本宗)** is originally beyond gain or loss, **immeasurably vast (巍不可測)**, **ineffably wondrous (妙不可言)**. This is **the Dao (道)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What is **purity and stillness (清靜)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"There is **inner and outer purity and stillness**. **Inner purity and stillness (內清靜)** is when the **heart (心)** does not generate **impure thoughts (雜念)**. **Outer purity and stillness (外清靜)** is when **all external defilements (諸塵)** do not cling or attach. This is **purity and stillness (清靜)**."*

Danyang asked again: *"What are the **Three Lives (三命)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"The *Yellow Court Scripture (黃庭經)* states:
*'Preserving **jing (精)** is the **Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Beginning (元始天尊)**,
Preserving **shen (神)** is the **Supreme Daoist Lord (太上道君)**,
Preserving **qi (氣)** is the **Supreme Daoist Old Lord (太上老君)**.
Together they are called **Three Lives (三命)**.

After this, to seek the **Three Lives** further is a futile effort.
**Spirit (神)** and **qi (氣)** are the same in essence;
The **Supreme Daoist (太上)** leaves a **convenient path (方便之門)** for transformation into humanity—this is always possible.
Among these three, **Lord of the Eastern Peak (東華帝君)** is the **heart (心)**.
He transforms the **ten directions of all spirits (十方諸靈)**.
The **Great Emperor (大帝)** is the **kidneys (腎)**.
Beyond these, there is no need to seek further."*

*"The heavens possess **Nine Stars (九星)**, humans possess **Nine Orifices (九竅)**.
The heavens have **Four Seasons (四時)**, humans have **Four Great Elements (四大)**.
The heavens have **earth, water, fire, and wind (地水火風)**, humans have **earth, water, fire, and wind (地水火風)**.
The heavens possess **Five Firmnesses (五剛)**, the earth possesses **Five Firmnesses (五剛)**, and humans possess **Five Firmnesses (五剛)**.
The heavens possess **Three Talents (三才)**, humans possess **Three Talents (三才)**."*

Danyang asked: *"What are the **Nine Stars (九星)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"They are the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper (北斗七元星)**, **Left Minister (左辅)**, and **Right Minister (右弼)**—together, nine stars."*

Danyang asked: *"What are the **Five Firmnesses (五剛)** of the earth?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"They are the **Five Sacred Mountains (五岳)**—**Heng (恒)**, **Heng (衡)**, **Tai (岱)**, **Hua (華)**, and **Song (嵩)**."*

Danyang asked: *"What are the **Five Firmnesses (五剛)** of humans?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"They are the **liver (肝)**, **gallbladder (胆)**, **spleen (脾)**, **lungs (肺)**, and **kidneys (腎)**."*

Danyang asked: *"What are the **Four Seasons (四時)** of the heavens?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"They are **spring (春)**, **summer (夏)**, **autumn (秋)**, and **winter (冬)**."*

Danyang asked: *"What are the **Four Great Elements (四大)** of humans?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"They are the **four limbs (四肢)** and **Four Great Elements (四大)**."*

Danyang asked: *"What are the **earth, water, fire, and wind (地水火風)** of the heavens, and what are the **earth, water, fire, and wind (地水火風)** of humans?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"The heavens possess **earth, water, fire, and wind (地水火風)** as **metal (金)**, **wood (木)**, **water (水)**, **fire (火)**, and **earth (土)**.
Humans possess **earth, water, fire, and wind (地水火風)** as follows:
**Heart (心)** is **fire (火)**,
**Jing (精)** is **water (水)**,
**Qi (氣)** is **wind (風)**,
**Body (身)** is **earth (土)**.
Thus, they are **earth, water, fire, and wind (地水火風)**."*

「Danyang asked: *"What is called the **Three Powers (三才)**?"*
The Ancestor replied: *"The **Three Powers (三才)** of the heavens are the **Moon (月)** and **Stars (星)**.
The **Three Powers (三才)** of the earth are **Yi (乙)**, **Bing (丙)**, and **Ding (丁)**.
The **Three Powers (三才)** of humans are **Jing (精)**, **Shen (神)**, and **Qi (氣)**."*

Again, the Ancestor said: *"The eyes are windows, the mouth is the gateway.
The **Heart (心)** and **Kidneys (肾)** are the **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**.
Beyond this body, one must not seek externally."*

Danyang asked: *"What is called **Refining and Augmenting the Vital Fire (抽添火候)**?"*
The Ancestor replied: *"To eliminate all dust and impurities, all杂念 (杂念, *杂念, miscellaneous thoughts*), and to maintain **Shen (神)** and **Qi (氣)** without ceasing,
while not obscuring one’s **inherent nature (本性)**,
this is called **Refining and Augmenting the Vital Fire (抽添火候)**."*

Danyang asked: *"What is called **Taking the Leap of Faith (出家)**?"*
The Ancestor replied: *"Laozi (老君) said:
*'If one can remain perpetually serene and still,
all of heaven and earth shall return to them.*
Those who cultivate **virtue/power (德)** through meritorious deeds and sincere practice
are said to have **Taken the Leap of Faith (出家)**."*

Danyang asked: *"What is called the **Seven Returns of the Supreme One (太上七返)**?"*
The Ancestor replied:
*"1. To speak little, nurturing **internal Qi (内炁)**.
2. To restrain **Heart (心)** and **nature (性)**, nurturing **Jing (精)** and **Qi (氣)**.
3. To abstain from rich flavors, nurturing **blood and Qi (血气)**.
4. To avoid anger and wrath, nurturing **Lung Qi (肺气)**.
5. To eat well, nurturing **Stomach Qi (胃气)**.
6. To think and deliberate little, nurturing **Liver Qi (肝气)**.
7. To minimize cravings and desires, nurturing **Heart Qi (心气)**.
This is it."*

Xu Shen’ong (徐神翁) annotated: *"Only when **Shen (神)** and **Qi (氣)** are undisturbed and saliva is reduced
does one belong to those of **mid-level cultivation (中修行人)**.
This is the intent of the **Three Teachings’ Sage Ones (三教圣人)**.
For ordinary people, **Taking the Leap of Faith (出家)** means
abandoning fame and rejecting profit,
forgetting emotions and renouncing desires—
then the **Heart (心)** becomes empty,
and when the **Heart (心)** is empty, **Qi (氣)** settles,
when **Qi (氣)** settles, **Shen (神)** clears,
and when **Shen (神)** clears, **virtue/power (德)** aligns with the **Dao/Way (道)** and is born."*

Confucius (孔子) said: *"**Ren (仁)**, **Yi (义)**, **Li (礼)**, **Zhi (智)**, **Xin (信)**."*
For those who cultivate:
The **Ren (仁)** do not abandon,
The **Yi (义)** do not defile,
The **Li (礼)** do not exalt themselves,
The **Zhi (智)** do not quarrel,
The **Xin (信)** do not speak falsely.

The *Vajracchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra (金刚经)* states:
*"**Anusmṛti Samadhi (无诤三昧)** is the highest among humans."*

Those who cultivate:
Clear their **Heart (心)**, and their **Shen (神)** naturally becomes serene.
The *Zhenren (真人) of Jin (晋)* said:
*"A clear **Heart (心)** and tranquil **Yi (意)** is the path to the **Heavenly Hall (天堂)**;
a disordered **Heart (心)** and chaotic **Yi (意)** is the gate to **Hell (地狱)**."*

Danyang’s Master (丹阳师) said:
*"To know the **Heavenly (上天)** and **Earthly (入地)** realms,
it depends on the **weakness (好弱)** of one’s **Heart (心)**."*

Mencius (孟子) said:
*"I cultivate my **浩然之气 (hàorán zhī qì, *vast and righteous Qi*)** well,
thus my **Heart (心)** does not move."*

The **Supreme One (太上)** said:
*"If one **Takes the Leap of Faith (出家)** but does not **subdue the Heart (降心)**,
a hundred years later, they shall not attain **the Middle (中处)**."*

Zhongyang Zhenren (重阳真人) said:
*"If one **Takes the Leap of Faith (出家)** but does not **subdue the Heart (降心)**,
they will return to **worldly bonds (世缘)**,
and **virtue/power (道德)** shall be diminished."*

The *Book of Life and Death (性命书)* states:
*"Washing the **Heart (心)** is like crossing the **Yue River (越)**—
this is the **root and foundation (根蒂)** of all things."*

The *Sutra (经)* says:
*"When the **Heart (心)** arises, **inherent nature (性)** perishes;
when the **Heart (心)** perishes, **inherent nature (性)** manifests.
The one who perishes their **Heart (心)** is a **treasure (宝)**."*

The *Sutra (经)* says:
*"All worthy ones first seek to **illuminate the Heart (明心)**.
The **Heart (心)** is the **Dao/Way (道)**,
and the **Dao/Way (道)** is the **Heart (心)**.
There is no **Dao/Way (道)** outside the **Heart (心)**,
nor is there any **Heart (心)** outside the **Dao/Way (道)**."*

#3 *There is likely missing text below here as well.*」

Zhongyang Zhenren instructed Danyang:

*"Now, when you ask: **‘What is the means to transcend the Three Realms (出离三界)?**
**‘What must one overcome to take the path of monastic practice (出家修行)?’**"*
