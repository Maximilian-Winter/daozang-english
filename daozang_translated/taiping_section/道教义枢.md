**Preface to the *Daoist Doctrine Pivot***
Compiled by Qingxi Daoist Master Meng Anpai

The **Dao** is the utmost emptiness, the utmost stillness—most true, most wondrous—yet within this void, nothing is excluded; within this stillness, nothing is unanswered.

Thus, the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable (Yuan Shi Tian Zun)** manifested in response to the cosmic breath, emerging from stillness into motion, arising from truth into response. At the dawn of chaos, in the depths of obscurity, He nurtured the Primordial Harmony and transformed the yin and yang.

Hence, the **Laozi’s *Dao De Jing*** states:
*"In the depths of obscurity, there is essence;
In the realm of indistinctness, there is form."*
And again:
*"There exists a thing, indistinctly formed,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent, formless—
Independent, unchanging,
Circulating endlessly without exhaustion,
It may be taken as the Mother of all under Heaven."*

Indeed, the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** manifested within the chaos, thus giving rise to the indistinctly formed thing.

The *Lingbao Limitless Salvation Sutra* says:
*"For countless eons within the chaos,
Above, no hue remained;
Below, no abyss remained.
The Diamond Vehicle ascended to Heaven,
Formless, shadowless.
The Crimson Clarity unfolded the diagram,
Moving naturally by decree.
The Primordial Venerable took his seat,
And the Five Scriptures were spread abroad."*

Thus, it is known that the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable**, of adamantine essence, rode the celestial breath, and spread His transformation through the Potter’s Wheel.
He ordained the divisions naturally, and the forms and symbols were established by the diagram’s unfolding.

The *Records of Books in the Ruist Canon* state:
*"The Primordial Heavenly Venerable was born before the Great Non-Existence,
Receiving the natural qi,
Piercing the void, distant and condensed—
Its extent unknown.
When Heaven and Earth decayed and the eons ended,
The Venerable’s body remained unvanquished.
Each time Heaven and Earth reopened,
He appeared either above the Jade Capital
Or in the Five Pure Lands,
Teaching the secret Dao—
This is called ‘Opening the Eon to Salvation.’
Yet His openings were not singular;
Thus, there were the years of *Yankang*, *Chiming*, *Longhan*, and *Kaihuang*—
These were but the names of the eras.
Those He saved were all celestial immortals and saints of boundless rank,
Including the **Supreme Venerable Laozi**, the **Heavenly True Man**, the **Five Celestial Emperors**, and all the immortal officials,
Who in turn received and transmitted [the teachings]."*

The scriptures He spoke also drew from the **Primordial Unity qi**,
Emerging naturally, not contrived—
They, too, coexisted with the Venerable, unvanquished.
When Heaven and Earth were unbroken,
The teachings lay dormant, untransmitted.
When the eon turned,
The texts revealed themselves.
There were eight characters in total,
Exhausting the Dao’s mysteries—
Called the **Heavenly Scriptures**.
Each character was a丈 in width,
With eight angles radiating light,
Their brilliance dazzling, startling the heart—
Even celestial immortals could not gaze upon them directly.
When the Venerable opened the eon,
He commanded the **Heavenly True Man** to blow and articulate the **Heavenly Sound**,
Interpreting its meaning.
From the True Man downward to the immortals,
They transmitted it step by step in succession.
Only then did the immortals pass it to mortals.

The *Lingbao Scripture* says:
*"In the Longhan era, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable emerged to teach and save.
After His passing, Heaven and Earth collapsed,
No light remained,
Men and women turned to ash,
And the world sank into Yankang.
Darkness reigned for countless eons,
Until Chiming’s light returned,
Heaven and Earth restored,
And I emerged anew as the **Nameless Lord**,
Teaching the Dao and saving all beings.
After my passing, one eon passed,
Heaven and Earth collapsed again,
No light remained.
In the first year of Kaihuang,
I appeared in the Primordial Azure,
As the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable**,
Propagating the teachings and saving the Heavenly True Ones."*

The *Scripture of the Original Conduct in Salvation* says:
*"From the Primordial Opening of Light until the first year of Chiming,
Nine trillion, nine hundred billion eons have passed."*

The *Scripture of the Original Boundary in Salvation* says:
*"The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, for your sake,
Temporarily manifested this visible form,
Teaching and guiding salvation.
Those yet unsaved remain for future karmic ties.
Now I return to the formless stillness of non-action,
The ever-quiet, unmoving place.
Again it is said:
Since I attained the Dao,
Countless eons have passed,
Yet I have always remained in the world,
Never departing.
If one is destined for salvation,
They will always see my form.
When the cosmic confluence shifts,
They will not see me.
The beings of this eon,
By their karmic conditions,
Will be saved through the Dao Lord.
Thus, I now ascend to the Mysterious and enter the Marvelous.
Your mortal eyes cannot perceive my true form—
It is said I have vanished.
But if you cultivate the correct vision,
You will see me as before, unchanged.
If you cannot discern the emptiness,
You may still rely on images,
Recording my likeness in your mind.
Cast in purple gold,
Write my true likeness,
Worship and offer incense as to the true form,
Meditate and pray with devotion—
The merit will be equal.
The poor may use clay, wood, or bronze,
Doing what they can with halls, curtains, banners, flowers, lamps, and candles,
Offering according to their means,
As if serving the true body."*

Having received this cosmic opportunity,
They will ultimately return to the Dao Supreme.

Thus, it is known that the **Dao Lord of Primordial Beginning**,
Born of the **Mysterious Qi**,
Suddenly manifests form—
Endless transformations unfold.

Displaying traces and assuming shapes,
Without cause or reliance;
Unveiling the **Dharma** and opening teachings,
With beginning and end.

The **Dao Master Laozi** guides beings,
Illuminating the principle of **responding through forms**;
The **Great Mysterious** reveals the essence,
Demonstrating the path to true quiescence;
The **Original Practice** discusses its **kalpa** and epochs,
The **Numinous Treasure** marks its sacred name.

Untainted by impurity,
This is called **Pure and Empty**—
The **Dao** of **Mysterious Marvel**, how can it compare
To the **Buddha’s** borrowed birth,
Only to awaken at the right shoulder,
Or the **Dao Master Laozi’s** emergence,
Surely from the left armpit?

Yet those of limited understanding,
Unable to exhaust the source or trace the origin,
Thus, those who favor Confucian learning
Only study the **classics and commentaries**,
And those who revere **Suchness** (*zhēnrú*)
Merely contemplate the **Buddhist scriptures**.

As for the **Dao texts**, profound and hidden,
Few dare to investigate them—
They neither grasp their intent nor comprehend their titles,
So they merely align with what they see,
And often dismiss the **Dao Lord** as mere myth.

Hence, it is said:
A well-frog cannot speak of the ocean,
A summer insect cannot speak of ice.

Truly, these words are credible!
Truly, these words are credible!

The **Dao Lord Yuan Shi** ascends to the **Mystic and Marvelous**,
His form and likeness manifest, his teachings widely spread—
**Daoist sayings** fill the world,
**Profound mysteries** abound in the **treasury of scriptures**.

Thus, the **symbolic** delves into their deep meaning,
The **Confucian disciples** borrow their subtle phrases,
And the **translators** truly adhere to their core.

Hence, **Confucian texts** and **Daoist teachings**,
Though their practices may sometimes align,
Their **ultimate truths** and **mystic texts**,
In essence, return to One.

To know their **root** is to forget all distinctions—
To grasp only their **branches** is where **contention** arises.

Yet among the world’s people, those who chase **branches** are many,
While those who return to **roots** are few.
To cease the clamor of rivalry within the heart,
Is surely impossible! Alas!

Zhuangzi once said,
*"All under heaven are perplexed, and though I have my direction,
How can I truly attain it?"*

There are **Zhi Gong’s** tenfold debates on **void and mystery**,
And **Zhongzi’s** fourfold discussions on emptiness—
Though they speak of **Daoist profundity**,
Their **vain arguments** prevail in victory or defeat.

**Wang Jia’s** eightfold distinctions,
**Song Xian’s** fourfold refutations,
The **Dao Lord’s** rectified **mystic texts**,
And **Master Liu’s** comprehensive theories—
All maintain **subject and object**,
Engaging in **contending exchanges** back and forth.

As for the **Two Observations**, **Three Vehicles**, **Six Penetrations**, and **Four Gradations**,
The **key doctrines** of myriad scriptures,
Hidden yet unexpressed—
Only the **Great Daoist Precepts** are fully expounded.

But their texts are vast and intricate,
Few scholars can study them meticulously,
Thus causing **practitioners** to lose sight of the **progressive stages** of cultivation;
And **discussants** to fail in discerning the **depth and shallowness** of **Daoist principles**.

Now, following this treatise,
I prune away the superfluous and elaborate,
And broadly cite the **Dao texts**,
To categorize their themes—
Naming it *The **Pivotal Principles of Daoist Teachings***.

I reveal the **Dao’s** fundamental teachings,
Mark the **essence of great principles**,
And compile them into **ten volumes**, **thirty-seven articles**.

So that those who **laugh at the profound** may awaken with clarity,
And the **diligent practitioners** may be guided to the **Dao’s core**.

**The Pivotal Principles of Daoist Teachings**
**Volume One: The Principles of Dao and Virtue**

**Article One: The Virtue of Dao and Virtue**

The Dao and Virtue are the supreme essence of the **Way**,
The profound culmination of wondrous transformation.

When the divine function operates subtly,
The principle resides in spontaneous generation;
When the utmost virtue permeates silently,
Its meaning encompasses all suffering and virtue alike.

In absolute unity of existence and non-existence,
All distinctions vanish, and this is its essence.

Thus the *Dao De Jing* states:
*"The Dao gives birth to it; Virtue nourishes it."*
And again:
*"The Great Dao is vast and unrestrained,
The profound Virtue is deep and boundless."*

The *Xi Sheng Jing* declares:
*"Dao and Virtue are mixed in primordial chaos, identical in mystery."*

**Explication:**
Dao is principle.
Communion is guidance.
Virtue is attainment, fulfillment, and non-loss.
Speaking of principle, it refers to the reality of emptiness and non-existence.
Speaking of communion, it means the ability to guide the birth of all **dharma**, transforming without obstruction.
The Master of the Yellow River says:
*"The Dao is fourfold in its guidance."*

Speaking of Dao, it refers to leading those who cling to forget,
And guiding the ordinary to become the **sage**.

The *Zi Ran Jing* states:
*"To guide the extreme is to return to the root;
The root is true nature, the extreme is delusive emotions."*

Speaking of Virtue as attainment, it means attaining the fruit of the Dao.
The *Tai Ping Jing* says:
*"Virtue is the proper attainment of what is right."*

Speaking of fulfillment, it means fulfilling the salvation of all beings,
And enabling them to attain the **Way’s** ultimate perfection—this is named in terms of the fruit;
It also aids in fulfilling the state of **emptiness** and **non-action**—this is named in terms of the cause.
The *De Jing* states:
*"Fulfillment and maturation are its essence."*

Speaking of non-loss, it means the **uppermost Virtue** does not lose its Virtue,
Thus it is said: *"Non-loss."*

The *Tai Ping Jing* further clarifies:
*"Constant attainment without loss."*

Yet Dao and Virtue are supremely mysterious,
Naturally beyond all names;
To initiate teachings for the ordinary, names are forcibly established.
Thus, they borrow the names of the **nameless**,
To proclaim the true principle,
So that one may recognize the **nameless** in the name,
And thereby comprehend the profound Dao.

Hence the *Ling Bao Jing* states:
*"The everlasting emptiness is natural spontaneity;
The Great Dao is forcibly named."*

**Article Two: The Virtue of Dao and Virtue in Essence and Function**

The Dao’s essence and function both pertain to the **Way**—
Its principle is **non-being**, its application heals the **illnesses of things**.
The Virtue’s principle is **being**, its application resolves the **confusions of the world**.

Master Lu says:
*"Emptiness and stillness constitute the Dao’s essence;
Emptiness without guidance, stillness without response."*

The Venerable Master Xuan Jing holds:
*"Wisdom is the Dao’s essence, divine penetration its function."*

And again:
*"Dao and Virtue are one in essence yet two in meaning,
One yet not one, two yet not two.
It cannot be said they have essence and function,
Or lack essence and function—
For essence is without essence, yet essence exists;
Function is without function, yet function manifests.
Thus, no single dharma is without its essence,
No single meaning is without its function."*

Seeking its essence,
It transcends space and form, neither yin nor yang;
Sight and hearing cannot perceive it,
And touch cannot distinguish it.

Seeking its function,
It can be provisional or absolute,
Left or right,
Small containing the great,
And the great residing within the small.
Its essence is without limit, hence it cannot be debated;
Its function is without end, hence it is shown in accordance with the situation.

The scriptures also speak of the **two Dao’s** and **upper and lower Virtues**:
Old interpretations state:
*"The Dao of constant stillness is said to be **non-action**, with four meanings.
First, it does not cling to sensory perceptions or discriminations, hence it is without mind.
Second, it does not obstruct substance or distinctions, hence it is without form.
Third, it cannot be grasped by names or speech, hence it is without name.
Fourth, it is not subject to change by time, hence it is without time.
Possessing these four meanings, it is called the **constant Dao**."*

Master Jia says:
*"The self should naturally have passed beyond form;
The laws of the Three Pure Ones are all attainable Dao,
Yet they are all without constancy."*

The **uppermost Virtue** is to forget Virtue,
The **lower Virtue** is to cling to Virtue.
Because of this clinging to Virtue,
The present age is forever bound by fixed perceptions.
If one believes there is a constant Dao to be sought,
Yet fails to comprehend the principle,
It becomes a stagnant teaching.
The Lord Lao expounds Dao and Virtue,
Directly curing this delusion.
The scripture states:
*"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao."*

It does not mean there is another constant Dao,
But rather that the Dao spoken of here
Is not eternally fixed—
One should not cling to it as constant,
Hence it is called **non-constant**, as a means of dispelling illusion.
This saying uses the Dao as medicine,
Originally to cure the delusion of things.
If the delusion is dispelled,
What Dao cannot be attained?
If one knows that non-attainment is attainment itself,
Then non-constancy can also be constancy.

**Article Two: The Virtue of the Law-Body**

**Explication:**
The Law-Body is the pure essence of the **Way’s** ultimate truth,
A wondrous form of supreme reality.
It manifests the four Virtues,
Responds to all ten directions,
Activates in stillness and quiescence as needed,
And guides beings through differentiation and transformation—
This is its essence.

Thus the *Sheng Xuan Jing* states:
*"I establish the circulation of **qi** through the eight extremes,
Now called Yuan Shi, now called Lao Jun,
Now called Tai Shang, now as World Teacher—
I adapt to people’s preferences,
Manifesting the Law-Body in accordance with their tastes."*

The *Ben Jie Jing* says:
*"In the clear and pure observation, the Law-Body is seen."*
And again:
*"Fragrant flowers, music, and dancing maidens
Illustrate and reflect the Law-Body."*

**Explication:**
Law is the standard; Body is the manifestation of **qi**.
The **perfected** one’s **qi** can be guided by Law,
Hence it is called the Law-Body.

In its transformation, the Body’s forms have many names,
Yet when traced to their origin,
They are summarized into six categories—
Three in essence, three in manifestation.

Thus the *Ben Jie Jing* states:
*"The Dao-Body is the still essence."*
And again:
*"It is also the manifestation-essence,
Distinct in stillness and activity."*

And again:
*"Thus the three essences can generate all things."*
And again:
*"The generating Body is the manifestation;
The manifestation creates evil."*

The three essences are:
1. The Dao-Body,
2. The True-Body,
3. The Reward-Body.

The *Tai Ping Jing* declares:
*"The Dao guides without fail, the Dao generates without fail."*
The *Du Ren Jing* states:
*"Only the Dao is the Body."*
The *Ben Jie Jing* says:
*"It is the true Dao, also called the Dao-Body."*

The second, the True-Body, the *Yu Wei Jing* states:
*"True and pure, firm and untainted—
Its substance is everlasting, abiding in doubtless constancy."*

The *Xiao Mo Jing* declares:
*"It is the True-Body."*

The *Ben Jie Jing* says:
*"My True-Body is pure and unobstructed."*

The third, the Reward-Body, is named for *reward*—
The recompense for accumulated eons of conduct.
The *Ben Xing Jing* states:
*"This present reward is revered by all celestial beings."*

The *Ben Jie Jing* declares:
*"The Primordial Sovereign’s true form,
Through countless eons of perfect practice,
Attains this Reward-Body."*

The three manifestations are:
1. The Response-Body,
2. The Partitive-Body,
3. The Transformation-Body.

The first, the Response-Body, is the act of *responding*—
Adapting to circumstances, manifesting traces,
Engaging with all living beings.
The *Qing Wen Jing* states:
*"With no mind, yet responding to all beings."*

The *Ben Jie Jing* says:
*"Adapting to the roots of things,
Displaying forms and colors,
Thus it is called the Response-Body."*

It is also called the *Generative-Body*—
Following worldly laws, giving birth to form.

The second, the Partitive-Body, is the *division* of my single form,
Dispersed across many places—
Though not one body, its appearance remains unchanged.
The *Ben Jie Jing* states:
*"Divided forms, dispersed substance,
Without limit in measure,
Yet seen only in one direction—
Thus it is but a hundred billion."*

And again:
*"All Partitive-Bodies arise from the Reward-Body,
Unobstructed in their function."*

The *Ling Bao Jing* declares:
*"The Celestial Sovereign’s form divides into a hundred thousand,
Present simultaneously everywhere—
As male or female,
All see the Celestial Sovereign,
All as one in place."*

The third, the Transformation-Body, is *transformation*—
The fleeting change of impermanence,
Sudden appearance, sudden disappearance,
Infinite varied forms,
No longer the original shape.
The *Ding Zhi Jing* states:
*"The Celestial Sovereign transforms into a mortal,
Passing through the assembly."*

The *Ben Jie Jing* says:
*"I am the Transformation-Body,
Manifesting in countless ways,
Through the six paths of human and celestial realms,
Acting according to conditions,
Sudden appearance, sudden disappearance—
Temporarily displaying forms."*

As for the essence of the *Body* and its traces,
The Dao-teaching scriptures explore the true nature of the Law-Body,
Uniting essence and trace—
No difference, no separation.

The three traced Bodies have distinct forms;
The three essential names share one substance, varied meanings.
That which is refined, intelligent, and pure is called the True-Body,
That which is empty and pervading is called the Dao,
That which manifests *qi* and virtue is called the Reward-Body.

From *qi* and spirit, the three meanings arise—
Unfathomable, yet one source.

Since it is the Law-Body, it must possess a wondrous substance.
Yet when we speak of *Body* and *substance*,
Is it without form, without mind?

The old texts say: *"The still essence is the original Body."*
With true unity and wondrous wisdom as its substance.

Thus the *Ling Bao Jing* states:
*"The source of boundless great wisdom."*

Form is the law of entanglement—
From the Nine Saints onward,
Having become entangled in desire,
All possess form.

When the True Dao’s entanglements are exhausted,
Only wondrous mind remains—
Yet this wondrous mind contains all virtues,
Still and unseen—
Called *wondrous non-being*.

When active, it rides the traces,
Like things possessing form—
Though mind and form are wondrous,
Things perceive them—
Thus it is called *wondrous being*.

Confronting essence and traces,
The traces have no separate substance—
Viewed as the original Body,
Stillness and function are called *substance*.

It clearly reveals the Law-Body’s ultimate essence—
Without form, without mind—
Yet now we speak of form and mind,
All are broken, all are for things—
How could there be certainty?

For those who love form among the masses,
To make them abandon form,
It is said the Ultimate Dao has no form.
Thus the *Xi Sheng Jing* states:
*"The Dao’s symbol is formless."*

For those who calculate the mind among the masses,
It is said the Ultimate Dao has no mind.
Thus the *Qing Wen Jing* states:
*"The Dao is the school of no-mind."*

For those who sever non-being among the masses,
It is said both form and mind exist.
Thus the *Ben Jie Jing* states:
*"There is none who does not know—
Thus it is also called mind;
The Dao-eye sees—
Thus it is also called form."*

The *Sheng Shen Zhang Jing* says:
*"Form and spirit are one,
Never separated,
Both enter the Dao’s truth—
For those who love both form and mind,
It is said the Dao has no form, no mind."*

Thus the *Ben Jie Jing* states:
*"Without reliance on thought,
Thus it is called non-mind;
Without obstruction,
Thus it is called no-form."*

This is neither mind nor form,
Yet capable of form and mind—
It is non-mind as mind,
Non-form as form.

Since non-mind is mind,
No-form is form,
It is also no-attainment as virtue,
No-substance as substance.

Again, the Law-Body encompasses ten thousand virtues,
Already perfectly complete—
Now four matters are raised to express praise,
Not to establish fixed reality.

Yet to lead beings,
To delight in their perception and attachment—
Once perception arises,
It contradicts this principle.

What are the four?
1. Eternal existence,
2. Bliss,
3. Freedom,
4. Purity.

Eternal existence—
Calm and unchanging,
Neither moving nor shifting,
Not subject to impermanence,
Nor moved by impermanence—
This is true eternity.
The *Bao Xuan Jing* states:
*"Calmly eternal and abiding."*

The *Dao Jing* says:
*"Calmly eternal and abiding."*

Bliss—
Joy is serene contentment.
The *Ben Jie Jing* states:
*"Joyful and smiling,
The whole body at ease."*

And again:
*"Peaceful and blissful."*

Freedom—
Unrestricted, all-pervasive,
No place it cannot enter,
In affairs, it follows its will—
Thus it is called *freedom*.
The *Bao Xuan Jing* states:
*"Emerging and vanishing freely."*

The *Ben Jie Jing* says:
*"True unity and wondrous wisdom,
Free and unobstructed."*

The *Hai Kong Jing* declares:
*"Threefold freedom."*

Purity in fruit—
The clear mind, a mirror of wisdom,
Called *clear wisdom*—
Its substance is flawless,
Thus it is called *pure*.
The *Ben Jie Jing* states:
*"Unstained and unsoiled,
This is called purity."*

And again:
*"Everlasting purity."*

Yet the Law-Body’s Dao-fruit
Heals the sickness of beings.
Or when beings are deluded,
They say a hundred years of life can be eternal,
The five desires’ realms can bring bliss,
They calculate their own bodies as *self*,
And love all forms as pure—
Not so.

Impermanence, suffering, no-self, and impurity—
The Sage acts thus,
Therefore reveals impermanence,
To elevate the low by the high,
And rob them of their false calculations.

Thus the *Xi Sheng Jing* says:
*"I yet see my white hair grow old,
Who can escape this?"*
This makes clear the world’s impermanence.

Again it says:
*"The form is the root of the brain,
Pain, itch, cold, and heat—
I am bound to the body,
Knowing this is a great affliction."*
This reveals suffering.

Again:
*"Who among the figures of heaven and earth
Is the sole eternal master?"*
This makes clear no-self.

And again:
*"I originally abandoned the secular world,
Disgusted with and detached from the world."*
This reveals the world’s impurity and the body’s impurity.

This is also the world’s affliction,
That which people detest—
This is the universal impurity,
Though those who uphold the teaching do not know it.

To dispel the delusion of worldly beings
Who calculate permanence, bliss, self, and purity as true,
The Dao-fruit is said to be impermanent, suffering, ownerless, and impure,
So that one may not rejoice in it as if it were permanent, blissful, self, or pure—
These four are the very examples to be treated.

To address this misconception,
The Dao-fruit is declared permanent, blissful, self, and pure.

Regarding the *benji* (original/ultimate) and *ji* (trace/manifest) distinctions,
Some masters say:
*"Beings originally possess the Law-Body,
With all virtues complete,
Permanent bliss manifest—
But obscured by delusion,
Thus unseen."*

Like mud mixed with water,
Its clarity unseen,
Or a deep pit of sand,
Where the original form is hard to discern.
When seen, no difference exists.

Another school says:
*"When originally possessed,
No virtues yet exist—
But beings have an inherent principle,
Thus it is said to be naturally clear and settled."*

Now, these two interpretations are difficult.
If originally endowed with all virtues,
How could delusion obscure them?
If obscured by delusion,
What virtue remains to be honored?
If originally devoid of virtues,
Yet virtues now exist,
Then they are impermanent.

Reason is originally possessed,
Reason must be permanent;
Manifestation arises now,
Manifestation must be impermanent.
If both reason and manifestation are permanent,
They must both originally exist—
Thus, this is not so.

Now, the Law-Body is not encompassed by the three worlds—
How could it already exist?
If it exists as permanent,
It has never been non-existent—
How then to speak of hidden or revealed?

When speaking of the divine origin as naturally clear,
It is simply originally pure and empty,
With nothing whatsoever.
If this principle is obscured,
It is called delusion;
If this principle is realized,
It is called nature revealed.
It is not that there exists another principle within beings,
Called the Law-Body, as permanent and pure.

Some say:
*"The trace-body is impermanent,
The original body is permanent."*
Others say:
*"Permanence should be the trace,
The trace is also called permanent—
Now, this is explained in relation to conditions."*
Such sayings also exist.

When discussing permanence and impermanence,
Both arise from function,
All are trace—
Neither permanence nor impermanence
Can be the original.
The Four Sentences are gradually eliminated,
A hundred contradictions are thus severed.

**The Third Section: The Meaning of the Three Treasures**

The Three Treasures are the beams of the Dao-gate,
The bridges for all ranks,
The fertile field of all things,
The true path of the Three Pure Ones.
To return to the original source—
This is their essence.

The *Jiutian Shengshen Zhangjing* states:
*"The Three Treasures are exalted,
The Nine Heavens’ ultimate truth."*

The *Zhengyi Jing* says:
*"Afflictions are countless,
Yet they return to the Three Treasures."*

The *Ben Jie Jing* declares:
*"The Three Treasures revolve endlessly,
Their operation never ceases."*
And again:
*"The Three Treasures penetrate the ultimate."*

**Explanation:**
The *Qingwen Jing* states:
*"The first is the Dao Treasure,
The second is the Taishang Scripture Treasure,
The third is the Great Master Treasure."*

Dao means "to penetrate and reach,"
Meaning it can self-penetrate and penetrate others,
And enable the vulgar to grasp principles,
Reaching the utmost bliss.

The Taishang Scripture:
*"Taishang"* means "ultimate and great,"
Encompassing all principles;
*"Shang"* means "exceeding, surpassing all teachings."
*"Jing"* means "law" and "constant,"
Speaking of the path and the means.
Law is the standard for all things,
Constant refers to the models of all sages—
Thus, the path by which principles are attained,
The way to enter the Dao.

The Master:
The *Xiaomo Jing* annotation says:
*"One who nurtures life,
Teaches virtue,
And serves as a model for others—
This is the Master."*

Master Meng said:
*"A Master is harmonious and inclusive,
Leading disciples must be many,
Interacting with others must be harmonious."*

The *Mengwei Jing* states:
*"A Master is harmonious."*
But harmony has both principle and practice.
Practical harmony is accommodating people,
Nurturing the many,
Like water and milk blending together.
Harmony of principle is seeking truth,
Aspiring to sainthood,
Without deviating from the mysterious Dao.

Collectively called Treasures,
Also called the Exalted Ones—
The *Zhengyi Jing Tukai Jiepin* states:
*"Exalted and supreme,
Precious and beyond price."*

The *Laojun Jingjiao* says:
*"Returning from delusion to unity,
Revering the Three Treasures."*
It also says:
*"The Three Treasures are priceless."*

The *Qingwen Jing* likewise states:
*"The Three Treasures—
First, the Three Exalted Ones."*

Now, following the scriptures’ explanations,
"Exalted" refers to their supreme status,
"Treasure" refers to their inestimable worth.
Since they are inherently worthy of reverence,
They are also metaphorically precious.

Inherent worthiness:
The Taishang is called the Dao-Law King.
The *Shengxuan Jing* says:
*"The parent of all sages,
The mother of all things."*
Because it generates the Law-Body and enlightened life,
It bears the names of parent;
It makes all things return and revere it,
Thus it is called the Law-King.
This is inherent exaltation.

Nothing surpasses gold and jade in value—
Humans have golden forms and jade-like essence,
The Law has jade characters and golden script—
This is inherent treasure.

Metaphorically:
Exalted like parents,
Precious like pearls and jade.

Regarding the essence of the Three Treasures,
The *Dacun Tudie* states:
*"The Dao Treasure is the formless form,
That is, the Taishang—
This takes the responsive body as its essence."*

The Master Treasure:
Those who attain the Dao become our teachers.
The *Mengwei Jing* says:
*"The Taishang Dao Lord,
Manifests teachings in form—
This is called the Master Treasure;
Responds through qi—
This is called the Dao Treasure."*

The wondrous scriptures that demonstrate the Dao—
this is called the **Sutra Treasure**.

The *Teaching on Grades and Categories* states:
*"Under the heavens, one attains Taishang—
Thus the Law-King cannot be duplicated,
The Transformative Master exists alone.
Therefore, the Dao Lord is rightly the Dao Treasure—
This is the Emperor’s designation."*

The Hong Family’s embryo enters the **Treasure Pearl**,
Attaining the Round Fruit,
Using this body-mind as the Dao Treasure’s essence.

The **Master Treasure**:
When the Dao-intent first arises, reaching the Nine Saints,
The Three True Ones of the original heart are the True Saints,
Five persons practice the Law—
This body-mind is the Master Treasure’s essence.

If there are divine powers and responsive manifestations,
They follow their inherent capacity,
Subsumed under the Master Treasure.

Thus it is known that five persons constitute an assembly—
According to the *Yellow Register Rite*, the minimum is five.
Again, the *Play of the One* states:
*"The Taishang dispatched the Three True Ones
To instruct the Celestial Master Xu Lai in the *Degree of the Immortal Lord* scripture,
Thus it is known that five persons alone practice the Great Law."*

The **Sutra Treasure** has three interpretations:
1. The first says its essence is principle—
   *"Texts can perish, but principle endures,
   Thus it is called a Sutra."*
2. The second says scripture and principle together form the Sutra—
   *"Principle aligns with constancy, text with the Law."*
3. The third says text is the Sutra’s essence—
   *"Without principle yet spoken, no Sutra exists;
   Only when teachings are established does the name ‘Sutra’ apply."*

If one fixes on a name and clings to one interpretation,
All three explanations become rigid.
Adapting to circumstances, all three interpretations are valid,
Following sentiment, the latter is subtler.

Since the teachings of the Sutras are mostly text-based,
They are called Sutras.

Moreover, the Dao Lord’s original form and traces are the Dao Treasure,
While the Sutra has both principle and teaching—
The teaching is what the Golden Mouth proclaims,
What the Jade Tablets record,
Sealed with an official stamp,
Transcribed on silk scrolls—
This is the **Authentic Treasure Sutra**.

If the Nine Saints descend and speak personally,
Or if their words are sealed and recorded on silk,
Each can expound principle according to their capacity,
Entering the Sutra as **Transmitted Commentaries**—
This is its responsive nature.

As for the Five True Ones descending to instruct the Immortal Lord,
This is the **Authentic Master Treasure**.

If the Dao-intent first arises and ordinary Daoists practice the Law together,
Or if monastic Law-holders lack a five-person assembly,
Or if a five-person assembly does not fully possess the Master Treasure,
This is its responsive nature.

Images and portraits depicting the True Ones of past ages
Also follow the Master’s tradition.

Again, the Taishang Dao Lord is called a Treasure—
His form manifests the **seventy-two marks** and **eighty-one beauties**,
His mind embodies the **four penetrations** and **six transcendent powers**,
His wisdom is complete and his insight full—
With this body and mind fully adorned, it is the Dao Treasure.

The **Sutra Treasure** has the function of generating goodness and eliminating evil—
Sometimes a single phrase or couplet suffices,
Sometimes many chapters or verses are needed.
For example:
*"Better to die guarding goodness than live doing evil"—
A single sentence contains its full meaning.*

Again, as in the *Victory Over Evil through True Unity*,
Where the Two True Ones consult the Divine Source,
Opening metaphors and expounding harmonious teachings,
Many verses are required to fully illuminate principle.

Yet even four characters forming a sentence,
Or a single character expressing principle fully,
Is the **Authentic Sutra**.
When a single character arises, it is the **True Sutra**.

The saying *"Each character expounds principle"*—
*"A single character is the True Sutra"*—
Differs from this.

For instance, the character *ning* (宁) alone
Cannot convey *"guard goodness and die"*—
Such a lone *ning* has no clear meaning to expound.
Its explanatory function is insufficient,
Thus it is not the True Sutra.

But if a single character fully illuminates principle,
Then it is the True Sutra—
As with the character *Dao* (道).

The **Master Treasure** has three meanings:
1. **Renouncing home and distancing from the world**—
   The old texts highlight five virtues:
   - Dwelling in superior places—
     The *Root and Boundary Sutra* says: *"Secluded in mountain forests."*
     It also says: *"Relying on pure halls."*
     The *Ascending the Mysterious Sutra* says: *"Empty halls and vacant chambers,
     Called the Immortal’s domain."*
     This means unconstrained and free,
     Naturally inclined toward goodness.
   - Taking refuge under a clear teacher—
     Having attained a superior place, one should follow the superior person.
     The *Root and Boundary Sutra* says: *"I wish to meet a clear teacher,
     To consult the highest Dao."*
     It also says: *"Seek the affairs of a clear teacher."*
     The *Soul Jewel Sutra* says: *"Without a teacher, nothing is transmitted."*
   - Devoting the heart to the Law—
     Having found a superior person, one should request wondrous teachings.
     The *Root and Boundary Sutra* says: *"Seek and visit a clear teacher,
     Pray for essential techniques, the three cavern’s wondrous texts."*
     The *Soul Jewel Sutra* says: *"All efforts should be directed toward the Law."*
   - Promoting the Dao’s teachings—
     Having obtained the Mysterious Teachings, one should transform others.
     The *Root and Boundary Sutra* says: *"I wish with the Law’s sound
     To broadly awaken the ignorant."*
     The *Requesting the Highest Sutra* says: *"Broadly open the Law’s gate."*
     The *Stabilizing the Will Sutra* says: *"Promote and display the Daoist."*
   - Cutting off worldly ties—
     Wearing coarse yellow-brown robes and black headbands,
     Wearing silk and brocade—
     Though the form differs from the vulgar,
     The heart should abandon worldly habits.
     Thus the *Root and Boundary Sutra* says: *"Ragged robes and worn sandals,
     Concealing light and obscuring traces."*
     It also says: *"Abandoning worldly adornments,
     Wearing yellow-brown robes and black headbands—
     Thus, through outward appearance, the heart is led to transcend worldly bonds.
     Speaking practically, taking monastic vows is supreme."*

   Though it is said that one first receives the *Five Thousand Characters*,
   Yet they still maintain morning attire—
   As with the *Soul Jewel*, it is known that they had not yet entered
   The three cavern’s teachings or the number of the Master.

2. **Cultivating virtue and learning wisdom**—
   Those who follow the Law inherently uphold conduct and insight,
   Transcending the vulgar to become saints,
   With true wisdom as their excellence.

3. **Gathering an assembly to practice the Law**—
   As when the Five True Ones descended to instruct Ge Xian,
   And the Ten Directions transmitted the Taishang’s teachings.
   The *Ascending the Mysterious Sutra* says:
   *"The threefold assembly should be remembered as a field of merit—
   The Master’s words on assemblies are now clear."*

Yet the Master’s three meanings
May be fully or partially realized.

「If dwelling in the mortal realm,
   Those who abandon home and don golden robes,
   Cultivate insight and attain wisdom,
   With disciples gathered in assembly,
   Yet through human cultivation achieve the true understanding of the higher realms—
   Then the three meanings are fulfilled.

From the celestial ranks above
   Down to the boundary of the cosmos,
   Not all must wear yellow robes or dark-green headbands.
   Many instead adorn themselves with seven treasures as crowns,
   And nine luminous silks as wraps.

This is so because
   At the outset of learning, the heart is weak,
   Hence the varied forms of embodiment.
In the upper realms, there are no fixed forms—
   Those capable of comprehending the Way naturally awaken clarity,
   Just as the Daoist saints wear yellow robes—
   This is self-evident.

**Fourth Meaning: Position and Merit**
The meaning is: *Position and Merit* (道位功业).
   Ascending to immortality and learning the Dao,
   The ranks and merits differ,
   The fruits of attainment vary in truth,
   And distinctions of high and low are manifest.
   From the Three Vehicles and Seven Grades,
   Their essence may now be discerned;
   Through the Ten Transformations and Nine Palaces,
   Their application is clarified—
   This is their purpose.

The *Sutra of the Original Boundary* (本际经) states:
   *"Divine offices and ranks,
   True and saintly stages."*

The *Scripture of the Soul Jewel* (灵宝经) says:
   *"The rank ascends to the Immortal King."*
   And again:
   *"Merits are neither grand nor small."*

Explanation:
   *Position* is the term for stages and sequences,
   *Merit* denotes the virtues and deeds.
   The Great Treatise ranks and categorizes them,
   Yet interpretations vary.

Master Xu cites the *Sutra of the Cavern Spirit* (洞神经):
   *"Divine Persons, True Persons, Immortals, Daoists, Saints, and Virtuous Ones—
   Together they constitute the Dao."*

The *Great True Science* (太真科) declares:
   *"Those who establish merit among ghosts,
   Advancing to become Ghostly Immortals,
   Are all called Spirit Persons."*

The *Divine* (神) refers to boundless marvels,
   The *True* (真) denotes steadfast purity without falsity,
   The *Immortal* (仙) signifies transformation and ascension,
   The *Daoist* (道) embodies unobstructed emptiness,
   The *Saint* (圣) aligns with righteous names and deeds.
   These meanings often pertain to the fruit entering the cause.

Humans say:
   The *Saint* (圣) is one whose conduct and heart are upright,
   The *Virtuous* (贤) is skilled in discourse and wisdom,
   The *Spirit* (灵) perceives and discerns subtleties.

The first six are names for mortals attaining the Dao;
   The last is the title for ghosts and spirits attaining it.
   It is also said:
   Names number seven, yet ranks are three.
   The first rank is the *Immortal’s* (仙位),
   The second is the *True’s* (真位),
   The third is the *Saint’s* (圣位).
   Divine, Daoist, Virtuous, and Spirit—
   These have no separate ranks;
   Though their titles differ,
   They still adhere to the three stages.

Now, the scriptures reveal more names than just these seven—
   Such as the *Perfect Ones*, *Wise Ones*, *Exalted Ones*, and *Great Ones* (至人、智人、上人、大人).

Master Lu states:
   *"Beginning from the common mortal,
   Accumulating deeds to attain the Dao,
   First transformation is called *Immortal*,
   Immortal transformation becomes *True*,
   True transformation becomes *Saint*.
   This encompasses all nine palaces within the cosmos,
   And the *Supreme Clarity* (太清) beyond it—
   All are grades of Immortality,
   Yet when united with *True* and *Saint*,
   They form three stages."*

Since interpretations vary among schools,
   It is difficult to rely on any single one.
   Now, we follow the teachings of Masters Shao Liang and Xuan Jing
   From the *Treatise on the Mysterious Gate* (玄门论).

There are two meanings here:
   The first discusses the *inherent ranks of embodiment*,
   The second clarifies the *grades of Immortal attainment*.

For the *inherent ranks of embodiment*:
   Within the cosmos, there are *Desire Realm Observations* (欲观感生),
   Totaling thirty-two grades,
   And the *Desire Realm Merits* (欲善业),
   Which constitute the ranks of the *Three Realms and Four Folk* (三界四民).
   Beyond the cosmos lies the *Desireless Realm Observations* (无欲观感生),
   Twenty-seven grades in total,
   Which are the ranks of the *Three Clarities and One Vehicle* (三清一乘).

For the *grades of Immortal attainment*:
   From the initial resolve to the ultimate Dao,
   There are five stages:
   The first is *awakening the resolve*,
   The second is *subduing the Dao*,
   The third is *knowing the True*,
   The fourth is *transcending attachment*,
   The fifth is the *Supreme Dao* (无上道).
   These five stages collectively encompass four ranks:
   The first two stages are the *Ten Transformations* (十转位),
   The third and fourth are the *Nine Palaces* (九宫位),
   The fifth is the *Three Clarities* (三清位),
   And the final stage is the *Ultimate Fruit* (极果位).
   The first four are causes, the last is the fruit.

The initial two stages involve the *Ten Transformations*:
   The first stage of *awakening the resolve* is also called the *Roaming and Scattering Rank* (游散位),
   And is the first transformation—
   Breaking through the cycle of birth and death,
   Turning toward the Daoist realm,
   From delusion returning to awakening,
   Transforming the mundane into the Dao.

The *Great Precepts Sutra* (大戒经) states:
   *"Good men and good women,
   Who can awaken the natural intent of the Dao,
   Entering the path of the Law,
   Receiving my Ten Precepts,
   Become pure and faithful disciples of the Great Dao—
   All share the merit of the *Flying Heavenly* (勇猛飞天).
   The *Flying Heavenly* are those who have not yet attained the Dao.
   This is the first transformation of the Dao,
   Where disciples enter the initial stage of the Ten Transformations.
   Again, it is said:
   If one remains in the first transformation
   And cultivates the *undaunted heart* (精进心) without slacking,
   They attain the *Flying Heavenly*,
   And from this point onward,
   They transcend the Three Realms.
   Thus, this awakening of resolve is the first transformation.
   Again, it is said:
   Pure and faithful disciples,
   Present in this world,
   Liberated from all sufferings,
   Their bodies radiant and forms spiritually refined,
   Subduing demonic energies,
   Are those who have turned from evil and entered the righteous Dao.
   Yet the mere pursuit of the *Flying Heavenly* (飞天)
   Is still the rank of *subduing*—
   They have not yet attained the *True Knowledge of the Dao*,
   Hence it is said they have not yet attained the Dao.
   When spoken of as *riding the celestial chariots*,
   This refers to the *Nine Palaces True Rank* (九宫真位),
   The rank of *riding the celestial chariots*.

Within the stage of *subduing the Dao*,
   There are nine transformations,
   Three kinds of *insights* (解), each with three transformations,
   Totaling nine transformations.
   The three kinds of *insights* are:
   The first is *martial insight* (武解),
   The second is *literary insight* (文解),
   The third is *corpse transformation* (尸解).

The *Illumination of the Four Extremes* (四极明科) and *True Traces* (真迹) both state:
   *Martial insight* (武解) are the *Ghostly Marshals* (地下鬼帅) beneath the earth.

The *Illumination* (明科) says:
   *Literary insight* (文解) also has three grades,
   The lowest being those who dwell in outer shelters,
   Idle and without affairs,
   All in the *Cavern Heavens* (洞天),
   Advancing every one hundred and forty years,
   Serving as attendants to the Immortals.

The *Sutra of the Four Extremes* (四极明科) and *True Traces* (真迹) also state:
   *Martial insight* (武解) progresses in three tiers—
   The Ghostly Marshals advance every two hundred years,
   Each tier distinct.
   It is also said:
   Those who cultivate virtues in this world,
   Transcending the name *Eastern Hua* (东华),
   Do not partake in the *Three Officials’* (三官) realm.
   Again, it is said:
   Those who are supremely loyal and filial,
   Supremely honest and true,
   Undergo transformation and rebirth,
   Becoming Ghostly Officials (鬼官).»

其二等则径直得以游行于仙阶，侍奉仙人差遣，每一百四十年晋升补任禁卫之职，如同世间散吏。
其三等则得以进入仙人之堂，游行于神州之乡，入宴于东束华也。

其尸解三等者，下等或因刀兵，或因灭度，暂时游于太阴，或由太一守护其尸，三魂营卫骨骸，魄魂守护肉身，灵气结聚，不久便再生。
次等则如蝉蜕，或假借他物代替形体，虽经殡葬埋藏，隐匿而去，后开棺时，唯见杖履。
上等则以剑杖代替尸身，顷刻间升化，倏然消失踪迹，遂游于虚空。

寻此十转，伏结所招感，位存似空，未登真解，始在初门，并非乘位。

宋法师云：报应有十转，其一至九转，皆在世间八方，中央有士得富贵，名书于东华；其十转则上生三界，成为飞天之人。
若行六情六度生戒，一转便与飞天齐功，故《明真经》云：功齐十转，报位得及飞天也。
今明度生之戒，亦未可明言，但未真成即居，似位其间。
或有超悟而上，或有历位而升，随根性之利钝，逐悟性之深浅，似解若成，进登其位。
故因兹十转，入彼九宫。《度人经》云：得为九宫真人。
故知真解若成，即登此位也。

又《海空经》中所明十转，即所谓无忧转、净心转、释滞转、通儒转、达解转（二）、善见转、权物转、了机转、大明转、具足转。
此之时，转义又各不同，从转悟而论，非就位而辩，即是一经别致耳。

其九宫位者，下三宫为地仙，小乘三品；中三宫为中乘，天仙三品；上三宫为大乘，飞仙三品。
乘各三品，利钝平等，人故成九宫。金箓简文云：地仙、天仙、飞仙是也。
地仙游诸名山，天仙、飞仙则升出三界之表。《八素真经》云：太清之下，次得九宫之飞仙是也。
此并是界内无欲，真空始入，观妙未能圆虚，虽无感生之力，而解品可尊，故受兹位。
其下之六宫，二乘之业，近齐三界二十八天，大劫交周，不免生死。
上三宫大乘之业，与四民天同，虽未登举，已超三界，大劫交周，灾所不及。
故《太真科》云：已出三界，虽未登举，预种民者，皆无退转。
若运开须化，应感下生，和光同尘，不累其德，接引后生，申明道教。
是知劫坏则飞升上境，故有飞仙之名；劫成则应为民种，故有种民之号。
但三乘之业，根性不同，或有超升，或有历位，今举大纲，其义如此。

次界外三清位者，太清仙九品，上清真九品，玉清圣九品，三九二十七品，同修平等，俱入一乘。
观有浅深，义开差等，何者？
《太真科》云：小乘仙有九品，一者上仙，二者高仙，三者大仙，四者神仙，五者玄仙，六者真仙，七者天仙，八者灵仙，九者至仙。
中乘真有九品，一者上真，二者高真，三者太真，四者神真，五者玄真，六者仙真，七者天真，八者灵真，九者至真。
大乘圣有九品，一者上圣，二者高圣，三者大圣，四者神圣，五者玄圣，六者真圣，七者仙圣，八者灵圣，九者至圣。
通寻三品，同用九名，而第六一名，三位差互：仙品用“明”#1，真位用“仙”名，圣位用“真”名。
此当名“真”，信居中义，通上下耳。
又圣第七，没其“天”名而用“仙”名，此示大能含小。
余名尽同者，欲示诸名并可互通。
何者？三九不同，而俱是无欲，观体不无优劣，故有仙真圣殊。
但知上圣、高圣、大圣，是圣之上品；
神圣、玄圣、真圣，是圣之中品；
仙圣、灵圣、至圣，是圣之下品。
圣品既尔，仙真例然。
此三九若望界内入一大乘，其间自论，义开三品，经亦差等。

The threefold Dao is subtly distinguished, yet above it is encompassed as the One Vehicle of the Way. Now, when explaining these distinct names, the superior is called "victorious" and occupies the highest rank of each category, hence its name. The "high" refers to the exalted Dao, whose virtue is noble and lofty, thus named by virtue. Its essence is vast and divine, sometimes transcending through self-cultivation, its words spontaneous as celestial speech. The "mysterious" is unobstructed. The "ultimate" refers to each attaining their highest rank.

The meanings of "immortal" and "spirit" have been explained as before.

As for the order of ranks, there are two gates:
1. Attaining the rank of Immortal,
2. Manifesting in birth.

Those who attain the rank of Immortal, from the Nine Saints onward, hold three positions:
1. The Three Pure Ones,
2. The Nine Palaces,
3. The Thirty Transformations—all as previously explained.

Those who manifest in birth are roughly divided into four ranks:
1. The Three Pure Ones beyond the realms—namely, the twenty-seven grades of the Three Nines, where Immortals, True Ones, and Saints equally cultivate without desire, their virtue benevolent in manifesting birth.
2. The Four Heavenly Ministers within the Three Realms, who sever habitual defilements, their virtue benevolent in manifesting birth with desire.
3. The Twenty-Eight Heavenly Realms within the world, purified in the threefold karma, their virtue benevolent in manifesting birth with desire.
4. The Human Realm, bound by the Five Precepts, their virtue benevolent in manifesting birth with desire.

The Three Evil Paths are not considered—True Saints are virtuous deeds, never reborn there.

If speaking of responsive transformation, this belongs to another category. Now, when viewing these ranks in terms of manifesting birth:
- The Three Pure Ones beyond the realms are not clearly distinguished in their own equality.
- The Four Heavenly Ministers belong to the upper three palaces of the Nine Palaces.
- The Four Formless Heavens align with the middle three palaces.
- The Six Upper Realms of the Form Realm align with the lower three palaces.
Thus, the Song Master interpreted these six heavens as "unrelated and unentered."

This encompasses the thirteen heavens of the Form Realm.
From the True Saints’ attainment downward, the twelve heavens of the lower Form Realm correspond to those of partial understanding.

The Six Desire Realms and the intermediate mortal existence are all born from scattered virtues. Yet True Saints often dwell among humans, for cultivation allows entry into these scattered ranks.

"Scattered" has three meanings:
1. Not yet entering the Dao of submission,
2. Not yet attaining True Completion,
3. Not yet fulfilling their duties—all are called "scattered."

However, the two meanings of manifesting as Immortals differ. Now, broadly speaking, these are not fixed standards.

The reason is this: some are born far from the summit of the realms yet lack True Completion; some are near in the human world yet attain it; some align with their rank yet possess this vision. Thus, these two gates cannot be rigidly measured.

That the ranks of Immortals follow this order is known from the *Scripture of the Flying Feather*: "The Jade Pure is the lofty spirit of the Upper Pure; the Supreme Pure is the exalted essence of the Flying Immortal."

The *Eight Essentials Scripture* states: "The True Ones beneath the Jade Pure Palace are the Upper True Ones of the Upper Pure Palace; the Upper True Ones of the Supreme Extremity Palace are the Lower True Ones of the Upper Pure Palace; the Upper True Ones of the Supreme Pure Palace are the Lower True Ones of the Supreme Extremity Palace. From here downward, one attains the Flying Immortals of the Nine Palaces."

Examining these two scriptures, both place the Flying Immortals beneath the Supreme Pure.

*The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* quotes a Daoist scripture: "The superior adept ascends in form to the void, called a Heavenly Immortal; the middle adept wanders in famous mountains, called an Earthly Immortal; the inferior adept dies first, then departs, called Corpse-Resolution."

This directly takes "ascending to heaven" as Heavenly Immortal, "wandering on earth" as Earthly Immortal, and "shedding the form" as Corpse-Resolution.

*The Scripture of Natural Transformation* says: "Upper Immortals ascend to heaven in broad daylight; middle Immortals dwell in Kunlun, Penglai, and other sacred mountains, building palaces in the void; lower Immortals dwell in caves of famous mountains, governing life and death from above."

Again, *The True Science* states: "After the Great Jia-Shen [year], it becomes the beginning of a new heaven. From beginning to end, scholars remain unchanged. All beings—human and otherwise—share the same virtues and vices. Within one heaven, only one attains the Supreme Sage, one becomes the Celestial Sovereign, one the Venerable Master, one the Celestial Teacher. Though many seek the Dao, few attain it. Among them, some become Saints, True Ones, Immortals, or common folk, lingering in scattered ranks awaiting the next Sage—endless in number."

It is further said that transformations may occur in other heavens or other worlds. Now, what these teachings illuminate is ultimately without fixed place—it adapts to what is fitting for each person.

The Green Lord says: "The essence of the Nine Heavens condenses into the Nine Palaces’ ranks, hence the Nine Palaces’ discussion of ranks, as clarified here."

Again, the *Eight Essentials Scripture* states: "The Supreme Extremity is a palace within the Supreme Pure realm."

The *Scripture of the Birth of the Spirit* says: "The Three Sovereigns, the Cavern Spirits, the Supreme Pure, and the Supreme Extremity Palace—this is their verification."

As for the practice of virtue, there are two paths in the Dao: aspiration and action. Thus, *The Upper Scripture of Inquiry* says: "All comes from aspiration; without aspiration, nothing is accomplished."

*The Scripture of the Origin* states: "All actions are expedient teachings."

Aspiration has two meanings: seeking the fruit of the Dao above, or transforming beings below. The fourfold mind of the Great Vehicle is the Great Aspiration; if one seeks only the Three Realms and self-liberation, it is the Small Aspiration.

Action has four meanings:
1. **Techniques**—refining and ingesting methods, elixirs, and prayers. The Small Vehicle confines itself to this alone; the Great Vehicle uses it as auxiliary practice.
   *The Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious* says: "Refining stones, ingesting herbs—though life may extend to thousands or ten-thousands of years, death brings only greater suffering."
   *The Scripture of the Origin* states: "Ingesting elixirs and herbs preserves the root of life and prolongs existence."

2. **Precepts**—restraining wrongdoing to nurture wisdom’s root.
   *The Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure* says: "Wisdom arises from the root of precepts; true Dao takes precepts as master."

3. **Concentration**—observing the three, guarding the one, contemplating the spirit, pondering the True.
   *The Scripture of the Origin* states: "Cultivating stillness and concentration."

「Reflecting on subtleties to attain steadfast concentration.

**Wisdom**—comprehending the duality of emptiness and existence, perceiving the two aspects of desire and non-desire.
*The Scripture of the Origin* states: "Wisdom’s insight is clear and penetrating, illuminating the understanding of emptiness and existence."

Discourse, exposition, and teaching all fall under the category of **Wisdom**.
Thus, Master Xu says: "When the mind is concentrated, one practices *san shou yi* (observing the three, guarding the one); when it is scattered, one studies **Wisdom** through discourse and teaching."
He cites *The Scripture of Jade Capital Mountain*: "Discourse the Dao, attain true stillness."
*The Scripture of Requesting Questions* states: "To expound profound meanings."

Using these four principles—**Refinement**, **Precepts**, **Concentration**, and **Wisdom**—to regulate body and mind.
In general, body and mind cultivation encompasses two paths: **internal** and **external**.
Practicing **Wisdom** and upholding **Precepts** constitutes the **internal path**; liberating life and offering alms, constructing and repairing temples, is called the **external path**, also known as *sàn shàn* (dispersing virtue/merit).

Though four categories are outlined here, if examined closely in the scriptures, only two are discussed.
*The Scripture of Penetrating the Divine* (Chapter 11) states: "All the saints rely upon only two things: **Dao/Way** and **Refinement**. **Refinement** is the scriptural method of **Precepts**; **Dao/Way** is the practice of non-desire and penetrating emptiness."
It further says: "In cultivation, non-desire is the primary focus; in **Refinement**, one must first observe the scriptural **Precepts**."
And again: "Non-desire and penetrating emptiness cannot be achieved overnight, so one must cultivate few thoughts and minimal desires, guard the **Dao/Way** of subtle contemplation and emptiness, and persist without slackening over time, thus aligning with the true **Dao/Way**."

Observing this text, it is clear that **Wisdom** encompasses both aspects of emptiness and existence, and all matters are classified accordingly—**Dao/Way** is the **Wisdom** of emptiness, **Refinement** is the **Wisdom** of existence.
If so, then one directly enters the **Wisdom** category to fulfill prior vows, and both matters are complete. Discourse and teaching still belong to the **Wisdom** of existence.
Thus, *The Scripture of Penetrating the Divine* states: "Discourse and teaching for enlightenment, secret practices rely on **Refinement**."
It further says: "**Refinement** lies within the mouth."

Master Song says: "Practicing the ten precepts of the highest grade—if the mouth is pure, one is born into the realm of desire; if the body is pure, one ascends to the form realm; if the heart is pure, one attains the formless realm."
Now it is said that even with desire, virtuous deeds may remain unresolved, so purity is not yet achieved. Only true **observation** can sever this bond.
Master Xuān Jìng says: "Until death, one must observe the heart; only then is the bond of desire truly severed."

Moreover, there is non-desire and empty **observation**, and there is desire and **observation** of existence.
**Observation** of existence leads to emptiness, empty **observation** guides toward existence—guiding existence to its absence, **observation** of existence to its non-existence—thus it is called **true observation**.
**True observation** is also identical to non-desire, and only then does it bear the name **Dao/Way**.

**Dao/Way** is the pivotal essence of its teachings (Volume One should read *"**named**"*). **Dao/Way** is the pivotal essence of its teachings (Volume Two compiled by Qinghan Daoist Meng An).」

**Three Caverns Doctrine, Fifth Section**
**Seven Divisions Doctrine, Sixth Section**
**Twelve Divisions Doctrine, Seventh Section**

**Three Caverns Doctrine, Fifth Section**
The Doctrine states: The Three Caverns are the sacred harmonies of the Eight Unions, the profound teachings of the Three Manifestations, inscribed in gold and jade—studied diligently to return to the source. The phoenix-sealed scriptures, when cultivated and practiced, lead to enlightenment. This is their essence.

Thus, the *Hidden Commentary on the Jade Classics* says: "The Three Caverns scriptures and symbols are the fundamental principles of the Dao."
The *Scripture of Rectification* states: "The Three Caverns’ wondrous laws encompass all—this is the One Vehicle of the Dao."
The *Scripture of the Original Realm* declares: "If any scripture of the Twelve Divisions belongs to the Three Caverns, it is called *orthodox*."

**Explanation:**
1. **Cavern of Truth (洞真)**
2. **Cavern of Mystery (洞玄)**
3. **Cavern of Spirit (洞神)**

Truth is defined by its **purity**—unadulterated.
Mystery is defined by its **fluidity**—unobstructed.
Spirit is defined by its **ineffability**—unfathomable.

When spoken of collectively, the three names are interchangeable.
For the One Vehicle’s profound texts are inherently pure—naturally unobstructed in principle.
The Three Caverns’ sublime intent is inherently difficult to conceive—thus it is called **ineffable**.

When distinguishing them:
- The **Cavern of Truth** is **pure and secret**, thus named *Truth*.
- It establishes heaven and earth—its function is **unobstructed**, thus named *Mystery*.
- It summons and commands ghosts and spirits—its power is **ineffable**, thus named *Spirit*.

The term *Cavern* collectively signifies **universal unity**, clarifying that the Three Teachings can all guide mortals to sainthood and are all part of the **One Great Vehicle**.

As for their origins:
- The **Cavern of Truth** traces its manifestation to the **Celestial Treasure Lord**, whose essence is the **primordial qi of the Highest Supreme Jade Emperor of Chaos and Non-Being**.
- The **Cavern of Mystery** traces its manifestation to the **Spirit Treasure Lord**, whose essence is the **qi of the Highest Supreme Jade Emptiness of Crimson Chaos**.
- The **Cavern of Spirit** traces its manifestation to the **Spirit Treasure Lord**, whose essence is the **qi of the Highest Supreme Jade Emptiness of Obscure Communion**.

Their origins are fully explained in the *Chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Birth* and the *Great Treatise of the Mysterious Gate*. Here, we briefly clarify their order:
- *Heaven* represents **profound principle**,
- *Spirit* represents **refined essence**,
- *Spirit* (神) represents **freedom from entanglement**.

Thus, at the **initial stage of immortality**, one ascends to the realm of **freedom from entanglement**, hence the name *Spirit*.
In the **middle stage**, wisdom grows ever more refined, hence the name *Spirit*.
In the **highest stage**, wisdom becomes utterly unobstructed, hence the names *Heaven* and *Mystery*.

The collective term *Treasure Lord* signifies:
- *Treasure* as **worthy of reverence**,
- *Lord* as **encompassing all principles**,
- Clarifying that they are the **object of veneration for all sentient beings**.

Now, the **Cavern of Truth**’s Celestial Treasure Lord resides in the **Jade Purity Realm**,
the **Cavern of Mystery**’s Spirit Treasure Lord in the **Upper Purity Realm**,
the **Cavern of Spirit**’s Spirit Treasure Lord in the **Great Purity Realm**.

Thus, the *Scripture of the Supreme Dark Primordial Registration* states:
"The Three Purities are **Jade Purity, Upper Purity, and Great Purity**."

Now, *Jade* signifies **purity**—named for its essence.
*Upper* signifies **ascension**—named for its function.
*Great* signifies **universal transcendence**—encompassing both essence and function.

From subtle beginnings, they correspond to the Three—thus they may be understood.
At the initial ascent to the immortal realm, wisdom is universally transcendent—gradually named the **Upper Realm**, hence the name *Upper*.
They may also reside beyond the Three Realms, all worthy of being called *Upper*—hence the name *Upper*.
The Middle Realm encompasses the Upper and Lower, free from desire—thus the **Upper Realm is supreme**, hence the name *Jade*, marking its exalted excellence. This naming follows human perception.

The Three Purities are also the **sublime functions of the Great Dao**—named for their inherent nature, not without reason.

The term *Purity* collectively signifies **cleansing**.
The Three Pure Lands are free from all defilement—thus they are called *Pure*.
Their palaces and halls are countless and ever-transforming, beyond conception—now not exhaustively described.

As for the **essence of the Three Caverns**:
Their teachings, practitioners, and realms all originate from **one qi**, responding to sensations and conditions to form the three names.
Thus, the teachings, realms, and practitioners are named flexibly—sometimes by the practitioner’s perspective, sometimes by the realm’s characteristics, adapting to circumstances.

The *Scripture of the Jade Calendar* states:
*"Cavern of Spirit, Cavern of Mystery, Cavern of Truth—these are the names of the Three Pure Realms."*
This is because the realms are named in the scriptures, hence the terms *Cavern of Spirit*, etc.

Now, examining the differing titles of the Three Caverns:
- The **Cavern of Spirit** speaks of the **Two Sovereigns of the Cavern of Spirit**,
- The **Cavern of Mystery** speaks of the **Spirit Treasure of the Cavern of Mystery**,
- The **Cavern of Truth** uses various titles.

This is because the **Three Sovereigns** are named according to their teachings—since they are the recipients of the teachings.
*Spirit Treasure* is named after the **Teaching Lord**, as the **Spirit Treasure Lord** is the one who generates divine beings.
The **Cavern of Truth** has no unified title—various names are used to show that **Spirit is boundless and cannot be fixed**.

The **Three Caverns’ doctrinal bodies**:
- Initially, they are **teachings conveyed through forms and sounds**,
- Further discussed, they are **ineffable wisdom**—also considered as **the Three-in-One**.

The **Three Pure Realms**:
- Initially, they are **realms where forms and qi reside**,
- Further discussed, they are the **ineffable functions of the Great Dao**—non-dual in person and law, also possessing the **Three-in-One of spirit, essence, and qi**.

As the masters say:
*"Though the realms are three, their unity is unbroken."*

Regarding the arrangement of the Three Caverns’ scriptures:
Their volumes and titles are fully recorded in:
- Master Lu’s *Catalogue of the Three Caverns Scriptures*,
- Master Meng’s *Seven Divisions of the Jade Calendar Scriptures*,
- Tao Yuan’s *Scripture Titles*,
- *The Supreme’s Comprehensive Scripture Titles*,
- *The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures*—
all as previously clarified. Now, we briefly discuss their **initial descent** and trace their **transformative lineage**.

The **Cavern of Truth** originates from the **Celestial Treasure Lord**.
The *Jade Calendar* cites the *Scripture of Rectification*:
*"The Highest Supreme Jade Emperor, inheriting the primordial Dao of Natural Antiquity, composed the *Upper Purity Treasure Scripture* of three hundred volumes, the *Jade Decisions* of nine thousand passages, and the *Symbolic Diagrams* of seven thousand chapters, stored in the Nine Heavens above, within the Great Possession Palace. The Jade Texts were transmitted to the Upper Minister, the Azure Boy Lord, sealed in the Jade Flower Azure Palace."*

「In the year **Wu Jing** of the **First Era**, another copy was also inscribed and sealed within the **Western City Mountain**. The **Supreme Emperor** further commanded the **Great Imperial Expanse of Mulberry Grove** and the **Divine King of Yanggu** to compile the *Thirty-One Volume Independent Decisions*, with three hundred verses in the **Upper Scripture**. Today, the *Independent Decisions* also circulate in the world.

In ancient times, the **Young Disciple of Xiangcheng**, through the **Upper Purity Flying Step Celestial Canon**, treaded the **Seven Primordial Cycles and Six Epochs**, descending to grant teachings to **Yellow Emperor**, yet ultimately left no transmission.

In the **First Month of the First Year of Yuanfeng**, the **Queen Mother of the West** and **Lady of the Upper Primordial** together descended upon the **Han Emperor Wu** at the **Xianyang Palace**, conferring the **Essentials of the Twelve Affairs of the Five Celestial Emperors’ Spirit Flight and Upper Purity**. The following year, a **Celestial Fire** burned the **Pilings of the Hall**, and the scriptures ascended into the **Great Void**, vanishing from this world.

The **Upper Primordial Sage** **Master Mao**, whose personal name was **Ying**, was a disciple of **Western City Sage**. He received the **Upper Purity Golden Pendants and Jade Ornaments of the Three Celestial Manifestations**, and in the **Fourth Year of the Earthly Harmony Era of Emperor Xuan of Han**, ascended to heaven in the third month.

The **Upper Primordial Sage** **Master Su of Xuanzhou**, whose personal name was **Lin**, was a disciple of **Quanzi**. He received the **Upper Purity Three-in-One Method**, and also ascended to immortality in the third month, sixth day of the **Second Year of the Divine Office Era of Emperor Xuan of Han**, yet left no transmission to the world.

During the reign of **Emperor Xiaoping of Han**, the **Western City Sage** inscribed the **Thirty-One Volume Upper Purity Scripture** upon **Mount Yanggu** and granted it to **Master Qingxu, the Celestial King of Xiao You**. In the time of **Emperor Cheng of Jin**, he inscribed it upon **Mount Wu in Juyun Commandery** and conferred it to **Lady Zixu, the Primordial Sovereign of Nan Yue** and **Madame Wei Huaxun**. In the **Ninth Year of the Xianhe Era**, she ascended to heaven riding the **Whirlwind Chariot**, entrusting the scriptures to her son **Dao Tuo**, who further transmitted them to **Master Yang Xi**, the teacher of **Emperor Jianwen of Jin**.

**Master Yang Xi** was a disciple of **Lady Zixu of Nan Yue** and received the **Thirty-One Volume Upper Purity Great Cavern True Scripture**, ascending to immortality in the **Thirteenth Year of the Taiyuan Era of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin**.

**Master Xu Mai**, with the courtesy name **Shuxuan** and childhood name **Ying**, later changing it to **Yuanyou**, was a disciple of **Master Bao Liang**, the **Superintendent of Nanhai**. He received the **Upper Purity Scriptures**, then crossed the river to enter **Mount Chiji**, and never returned.

**Master Yuanyou’s younger brother, Master Mi**, served in the **Jin Dynasty** as **Commandant of the Imperial Guards** and **Attendant of the Imperial Household**. He also received and practiced the **Upper Purity Scriptures**, and passed away in seclusion.

**Master Mi’s son, Master Yu Fu**, with his full name **Shangming (Year Ten, Month One, Day Ten)** and courtesy name **Dao Xiang**, was a disciple of **Master Mi** and received the **Upper Purity Three Celestial Correct Methods** and the **Thirty-One Volume Curved Jade Phoenix Texts**. He then concealed his traces and transformed in seclusion.

**Master Yu Fu’s son, Huang Min**, and **Min’s son, Yu Zhi**, in the **Twelfth Year of the Yuanjia Era of the Song Dynasty**, hid in **Mount Xiaobai in Jian District**, entrusting the **Lingbao Scripture** and the **Three Caverns’ Marvelous Texts** to the **House of Ma Lang** in Jian County.

In the **Song Dynasty**, there was a **Daoist** named **Lou Hua**, who, at the end of the **Taishi Era of Emperor Ming**, secretly obtained the scriptures from the **rear chamber**. The **Daoist** **Shu Xiaozhen** then secretly informed **Emperor Ming**, compelling him to retrieve the scriptures. When the emperor ordered them to be opened, suddenly there appeared a **five-colored radiant purple light**, illuminating everything before his eyes.

By the **First Year of the Yuanhui Era**, **Ma Lang** presented the case and requested the scriptures from the previous holders. The emperor issued an edict permitting their return. Once the **Celestial Treasury** was revealed, the **Supreme Sun** could no longer conceal it, and **Ma Fu** took possession of the precious texts.

This is where the **Upper Primordial** inscribed his notes, yet did not simplify them for the common folk. They were copied and transmitted as the **True Originals**, known as such.

The **Scripture Titles** clarify this as well. **Dongxuan** originates from **Lingbao Lord**, compiled by **Highest Supreme Great Sage**, now following the **Primordial King’s** declaration to the **Queen Mother of the West**, the **Golden Scriptures and Jade Texts** within the **Supreme Purple Cloud Palace**, the **Lingbao True Texts**, and the **Ten Marvelous Scriptures**, totaling **Thirty-Six Volumes**.

According to the *Great Primordial Four Extremes and Bright Principles*, the **Dongxuan Scripture** appears only once in ten thousand kalpas.

Now, one copy is sealed at **Mount Tai**, and another at **Mount Laosheng**. In ancient times, **Yellow Emperor**, ascending **Mount Emei** to meet the **Celestial True Sage**, requested this method, riding a dragon to ascend to heaven.

At the time of the **Emperor’s** commendation, the **Nine Celestial True Kings** descended in a **Nine-Dragon Chariot** upon the **Platform of Pastoral Virtue**, granting the emperor this method. The emperor then sealed it at **Mount Beizhong**.

The scriptures that **Emperor Yu of Xia** received through his **sacred resonance** came from **No Different**. According to the *True One Natural Scripture*, the **Primordial True Sage, Emperor Yu of Xia**, was **Saintly and Perfected**, and the **Supreme Lord** ordered him to compile the **Lingbao Natural**. It distinguished between **great and small kalpas**, and categorized the **scriptures of Mount Zhongshan’s Divine Offerings**.

The *Eight Wonders Summoning Dragon-God Scripture* further states: **Xu Lai Le** and the other two **True Ones**, in the **first day of the first month of the Year of the Self-Mulberry** (己卯), at **noon**, transmitted the **immortal teachings** to **Master Ge Xuan** at **Mount Shuyu in Shangyu, Will County**. **Ge Xuan**, with the courtesy name **Xiaoxian**, then transmitted them to **Zheng Siyuan**, **Lord Sun Quan of Wu**, and others at **Mount Tian’ai**.

After **Master Ge Xuan** ascended to heaven, he combined all the **Three Caverns’ True Scriptures** he had received. One copy was transmitted to his disciples, one was hidden in **Mountains of Renown**, and one was entrusted to his family descendants.

He also transmitted to his junior disciple **Xiao Chuan**, **Xiao Chuan’s son, the Protector of the Military, Tie**, and **Tie’s son, Hong**. **Hong** then received the teachings at **Mount Ma Ji** from **Siyuan’s** descendants. **Hong**, known as **Bao Puzi**, in the **third month, third day of the Second Year of the Jianyuan Era of Jin**, entrusted the scriptures to his disciples **Hai’an Lord** and **Wangshi**, among others, at **Mount Luofu**.

Up to his descendant **Chao Fu**, in the **late years of the Long’an Era of Jin**, he transmitted the teachings to **Daoists** such as **Ren Yanqing** and **Xu Lingqi’s** disciples, and the transmission continues to this day, unbroken.

**Dongshen** originates from **Shenbao Lord**, compiled by **Western Ling Sage**. This text resides in the **Xiao You Heaven**, within the **Jade Repository**. The *Scripture Titles* state: the **Three Sovereigns’ Texts of Xiao You** originally came from **Da You**, all being the books received by the **Three Sovereigns of Ancient Times**, also received by various **immortal sages**. These were then hidden in **Mountains of Renown**. The **Sichuan Western City Mountain** and **Mount Emei** both possess this text.

**Bao Puzi** states: In ancient times, **Yellow Emperor** traveled east to **Qingqiu**, passing through **Wind Mountain**, where he saw the **Purple Palace Sage** receive the **Three Sovereigns’ Inner Texts**.

In the **Jin Dynasty**, **Bao Liang** studied the **Dao** at **Songgao Mountain**, and during the **Yongkang Era of Emperor Hui**, he, along with **Master Liu** in the **Stone Chamber**, conducted a **pure and solemn fast** while contemplating the **Way**. Suddenly, the **Three Sovereigns’ Texts** appeared in written form, following the **scriptures**, conveyed on **four hundred feet of silk** to **Ge Xuan** for him to receive. Later, **Ge Xuan** also transmitted the teachings to the descendants of **Master Bao’s** lineage.

---

The **Bao Puzi** further states: The text obtained by **Master Bao** in the **Stone Chamber** differs from the worldly versions, and **Hong** may have also received it.

**Master Lu’s** obtained version was initially transmitted to his disciple **Sun**, and later to **Master Tao**. **Master Tao** then established the **Zhi (枝) Branch**, leading to the present lineage.

**The Seven Departments (七部)**, in the sixth category of their teachings:

The Seven Departments are the **Dao/Way’s** manifestations in response to circumstances, teachings adapted to the capacities of disciples, encompassing all methods and benefiting all beings. Those who can traverse this wondrous gate shall attain the natural resolution of all bonds—this is their essence.

**Explanation:** The Seven Departments, as organized according to the **Zhengyi (正一) Canon**, are as follows:
1. **Dongshen (洞神) Department**,
2. **Dongxuan (洞玄) Department**,
3. **Dongzhen (洞真) Department**,
4. **Taicheng (太清) Department**,
5. **Taiping (太平) Department**,
6. **Taihuan (太玄) Department**,
7. **Zhengyi (正一) Department**.

The first three Departments precede the **Zhengyi Canon**, their meanings akin to the **San Dong (三洞)** teachings; now, the latter four are elucidated.

**Taicheng (太清)** is as **Master Meng** states: *"The Dao/Way’s primordial **qi** solidifies, its essence is supremely clear and vast—thus it is called **Taicheng (太清)**. The term ‘experience (境)’ is appended to denote the **scriptures**."* Now, this **scripture** derives its name from the realm it aids—**Taicheng (太清)**, which is where? This **scripture**, having clarified the **alchemical elixir (金丹)** techniques, grants those who practice it ascent to the **Taicheng (太清)** realm. Hence, it is termed **Taicheng (太清)**.

**Taiping (太平)**—*ta* signifies extreme greatness, *ping* denotes harmony. It reveals the unity of the **Six Extremes (六合)**, where the **qi** of **Taiping (太平)** flows. Thus, the **Taiping Jing (太平经)** states: *"Now, the **qi** of **Taiping (太平)** is in motion."* Some interpret the **Three Celestial Stems (三台)** aligning as **Taiping (太平)**, while others say the appearance of the **Augmenting Star (景星)** signifies **Taiping (太平)**. Now, this **scripture’s** emergence in the world harmonizes the **Six Extremes (六合)**, unifies all nations under a single path, and brings clarity to the **Dao/Way’s** measure—thus it can be called **Taiping (太平)**.

**Taihuan (太玄)**—The old saying claims: *"The **Laozi (老君)** concealed himself in the **Taihuan (太玄)** region."* However, the exact location remains unclear—it must be where traces are gathered and returned to their origin, where the **Way’s** profound essence is again profound, hence named **Taihuan (太玄)**. Now, this **scripture** is called **Taihuan (太玄)*** because it upholds the **reverence for the Supreme Profound (重玄)** essence, its teachings vast and profound.

**Zhengyi (正一)**—The **Mengwei Jing (盟威经)** states: *"Zheng* rectifies the **evil/heterodox (邪)**, *yi* unifies the **ten thousand (万)**."* It further says: *"The **scriptural teachings (法文)**—*fa* unites separation, *wen* divides principles."* This refers to beings’ separation from their **true nature (本)**, hence the mention of *separation*—later, it states: *"Returning separation to unity, abandoning falsehood for truth, thus the **Dao/Way’s** method is fulfilled."* The term *unify the **ten thousand (万)*** means to encompass all beings, guiding them to return to truth. Hence, it states: *"All disciples, by reducing desires, approach the **Dao/Way’s** essence. The **Dao/Way’s** essence lies in **unity (一式)**."*

*Rectifying the **evil/heterodox (邪)***—The text states: *"The common folk are coarse in their roots, far removed from the **Dao/Way**. The great **Dao/Way** is compassionate and merciful, establishing laws to guide and rectify them, urging them to open their hearts. When the two halves become one, unity achieves no failure, aligning with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence—thus it is called the **Zhengyi (正一) scriptural teachings (法文)**."* Now, *zheng* means uprightness, *yi* signifies singularity. This **scripture’s** essence lies in its **upright teachings (正义)**, dispelling **heterodox confusion (邪迷)**. Though it speaks of **a hundred paths (百途)**, all ultimately converge on a single principle—hence, it is called **Zhengyi (正一)**.

The **Department of Unity (通言部)** is so named due to its categorization.

The first three Departments share the term *ta* (太), while **Zhengyi (正一)** alone is called *zheng* (正) because the three Departments assist the **San Dong (三洞)** great methods, hence they are similarly termed *ta* (太). **Zhengyi (正一)**, however, broadly expounds the **Three Vehicles (三乘)**, distinguishing itself from **heterodox Dao/Way (邪道)**—thus it is called *zheng* (正).

Regarding the **four Departments (四部)** and their **origins (缘流)**, their volumes and titles also follow the conventions of other schools, as clarified in their catalogues. Now, their **causes and beginnings (因起)** are outlined.

**Taicheng (太清)** takes **Taiyi (太一)** as its core, with **Laozi (老君)** expounding it and the **Nine Sovereigns (九君)** further elucidating the **Dao/Way’s** essentials. It states: *"The **Taicheng (太清)** scripture emerged from **Yuan Shi (元始)** and was transmitted by the **Nine Elders (九老)**, then entrusted to **Laozi (老君)**. The **true persons (真人)** inherited it unbroken, all revering this Sovereign."* The **Zhengyi Jing (正一经)** states: *"The **Taicheng (太清)** golden liquid is the **scripture** of celestial and terrestrial patterns, comprising **forty-six volumes (四十六卷)**. This **scripture** elucidates primarily the **essentials of alchemical elixirs (金丹之要)** and the **rituals of celestial omens (纬候之仪)**. For now, their distinctions are not further analyzed."*

The **Mòjì (墨录)** records that in the **first year of Han An (汉安元年)**, the **Celestial Master (太上)** personally entrusted this **scripture** to the **Celestial Master (天师)**—thus it persists to this day.

**Taiping (太平)** takes **San Yi (三一)** as its core, taught by **Laozi (老君)**. According to the **first volume of the Jia (甲) Department**, it states: *"Scholars who study and practice this **scripture** shall seek its roots, and the **Dao/Way’s** fundamental essence is **San Yi (三一)**."* However, the number of volumes varies. Now, the **ten Jia-Yi (甲乙) Departments** total **one hundred seventy volumes (一百七十卷)**, which is the version currently in circulation.

The **Zhengyi Jing (正一经)** states: *"There is the **Taiping Dongji (太平洞极) scripture**, comprising **one hundred forty-four volumes (一百四十四卷)**. This **scripture** is renowned for its **rectification of the Dao/Way (明治道)**, verification of **fruition through practice (证果修因)**, and prohibition of **evil/heterodox (禁恶)** methods."* The **Dongji Jing (洞极经)**—according to the **Zhengyi Jing (正一经)**—was, in the **first year of Han An (汉安元年)**, personally taught by the **Celestial Master (太上)** to the **Celestial Master (天师)**, and its transmission continues to this day. As for the **ten Jia-Yi (甲乙) Departments**, it is recorded under the **one hundred eighty precepts (百八十戒)** that during the **reign of King Xiang of Zhou (周赧王)**, **Laozi (老君)** in **Shu (蜀)** instructed **Lan Ya Gan Ji (琅琊干吉)**. By the time of **Emperor Shun of Han (汉顺帝)**, **Gong Cheng (宫崇)** presented himself at the imperial court, offering the **divine scriptures (神书)**—**one hundred seventy volumes (百七十卷)**—received from his teacher **Gan Ji (干吉)**, titled the **Taiping Jing (太平经)**. The emperor did not believe him, and the **scripture** thus vanished.

Recently, it has been whispered that this **scripture** lies within a **stone chest (石函)** on **Hai Ying Mountain (海嵎山)**. From the **Song and Liang Dynasties (宋梁)** onward, seekers have failed to obtain it. Whenever they attempt to retrieve it, they encounter **howling winds and dark clouds (风雨冥暗)**, **thunderous lightning and tumult (雷电激扬)**. Even during the **initial reign of Emperor Chen (陈祚初)**, repeated attempts proved fruitless. Emperor **Chen Xuan (陈宣帝)**, however, was deeply fond of **Dao/Way and teachings (道法)**, so he dispatched **Zhou Zhi Xiang (周智响)**, the **Celestial Master (法师)**, to retrieve the **scripture**. The **Celestial Master (法师)** ascended the mountain, fasted in **purity and solemnity (清斋)** for seven days without success. Suddenly, **dark clouds and mist (云雾幽晦)** gathered, but the **Celestial Master (法师)**, with great resolve, pressed forward until **heaven’s light shone bright (天光朗然)**. He then commanded his attendants to open the chest, but even **tens of men (数十许人)** could not force it. The **Celestial Master (法师)** briefly used his hands to support it, and it **suddenly opened (豁然而启)**. Thus, he obtained the **scripture** and requested permission to return to the **imperial capital (台城)**.

The emperor, upon seeing him, extended **welcoming rites (迎礼)**, placing the **scripture** within the **Zhizhen Guan (至真观)**. He also requested that the **Celestial Master (法师)** lecture and expound its teachings within the observatory.

At that time, **Li An** brought peace to the world, and the realm achieved great harmony. From then onward, the **Daoist tradition (斯文)** flourished.

Since the emperor obtained the **scripture** through the **Celestial Master (法师)**, he was thus named **Tai Ping Fa Shi (太平法师)**.

The **Tai Xuan (太玄)** holds **Zhong Xuan (重玄)** as its core, being the teachings of **Lao Jun (老君)**. Hence, the *Dao Jun Xu Jue (道君序诀)* states: **"The Way’s essence is the essence of the essence (玄玄道宗)."**

Moreover, the *Tai Xuan Jing (太玄经)* declares: **"The Way is called *Dao (道)*, and its meaning is the essence of the essence (义枢玄玄)."**

Yet, what **Yin Sheng (尹生)** received was only five volumes: *Moral Dao (道德)*, *Miao Zhen (妙真)*, and *Xi Sheng (西升)*.

According to the *Zheng Yi Jing (正一经)*, it states: **"The Celestial Master (天师) was personally instructed by the *Tai Shang (太上)*, and the *Tai Xuan Jing* consists of **270 volumes**. It was first obtained in the **7th month of the 1st year of Han An (汉安元年)**. Since then, it has been passed down to this day.**

The *Zheng Yi (正一)* takes *Zhen Yi (真一)* as its core, being the teachings of the *Tai Shang (太上)*.

The *Zheng Yi Jing (正一经)* states: **"The *Zheng Yi* comprehensively expounds the **Three Vehicles (三乘)**."**

It further says: **"The Celestial Master (天师) himself claimed, ‘I received from *Tai Shang Lao Jun (太上老君)* the newly revealed **Daoist teachings (新出道法)**.’ Later, **Wang Changlv (王长虑)** altered the **precepts and methods (师法)**, so he compiled and recorded the transmissions, naming it *Zheng Yi*, with **42 volumes** on the new rituals.**

The *Yu Wei Jing (玉纬经)* states: **"In the past, the **Yuan Shi Tian Wang (元始天王)** sent the **Three Celestial Jade Boys (三天玉童)** on the **7th day of the 7th month in the 1st year of Kai Huang (开皇元年)** at the **midday of the 3rd wu-hour (丙午中时)**, to transmit the **white jade tablets and green jade records (白简青录)** to the **Imperial Master (皇上先生)**. This **scripture** was naturally obtained through this method, and **Xu Wu Master (虚无先生)** passed it on to **Emperor Yao of the Tang (唐尧)**. Later, **Hou Sheng Di Jun (后圣帝君)** commanded **Xiao You Tian Wang (小有天王)** to compile and promulgate it.**

In the late **Han Dynasty**, the **Celestial Master (天师) Zhang Daoling (张道陵)** devoted himself to contemplation in **Western Shu (西蜀)**. The *Tai Shang (太上)* descended personally, and on the **1st day of the 5th month in the 1st year of Han An (汉安元年)**, he bestowed the **Three Celestial Precepts (三天正法)** upon him, naming him **Celestial Master (天师)**. He also entrusted him with the **rituals, methods, and essential Daoist teachings of *Zheng Yi* (正一科术要道法文)**.

That same year, on the **7th day of the 7th month**, he further bestowed the *Zheng Yi Meng Wei Miao Jing (正一盟威妙经)*, along with the **precepts for the Three Businesses and Six Penetrations (三业六通之诀)**, and solemnly named him **Three Celestial Master (三天法师)** and **True Person of *Zheng Yi* (正一真人)**.

According to the *Zheng Yi Jing (正一经) □Zhi Hua Pin (□治化品墨录)*, it states: **"The *Zheng Yi Jing* contains **930 volumes** of scriptures, and **70 volumes** of talismans and diagrams, totaling **1,000 volumes**, which were entrusted to the Celestial Master (天师). After the Master ascended to heaven, he passed this **scripture** on to his successors (嗣师).** All disciples, both internal and external, who were utterly faithful, practiced and transmitted these teachings, and many attained the **Way (道)**. Their stories are not recorded here in full, but this text is now circulating.**

The **Seven Departments of Doctrine (七部义例)**, though artificially named and established, rise and fade with time. Though they may seem skillfully crafted in their era, they diverge from the **orthodox teachings (正宗)**, their interpretations conflicting with **principle and insight (理会)**. Thus, they require **fusion and elucidation (融释)**.

The *Zheng Yi Fa Wen Jing Tu Ke Jie Pin (正一法文经图科戒品)* states: **"Within the **One Heaven (一天)** below, both internal and external essential scriptures, from the **beginning of creation (开辟)** until the end of the **kalpa (劫终)**, total **123,000 volumes** in China, and **84,000 volumes** each for the **four foreign regions (四方夷蛮戎狄)**.** These are all **refined in meaning yet varied in expression (重理同辞)**, differing in **coarse and subtle teachings (粗细)**. Their division into volumes is not fixed, tracing back to the **Three Sovereigns (三皇)** and extending through the **Three Dynasties (三代)**. The *Tai Shang Lao Jun (高上老君)* served as their teacher, selecting the essentials into **13,000 volumes**."

The general outline is as follows.

Moreover, one must understand the **Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries (三洞四辅)**, which mutually support each other.

The *Zheng Yi Jing Tu Ke Jie Pin (正一经图科戒品)* states:
- **"The *Tai Qing (太清)* scriptures support the **Cavern of the Spirit (洞神部)** and the **Immortal ranks (仙品)** below the **Golden Elixir (金丹)**."**
- **"The *Tai Ping (太平)* scriptures support the **Cavern of the Mysterious (洞玄部)** and the **Ten Departments of the Alphabet (甲乙十部)** below the **True Practices (真业)**."**
- **"The *Tai Xuan (太玄)* scriptures support the **Cavern of the True (洞真部)** and the **Five Thousand Characters (五千文)** below the **Sage Practices (圣业)**."**
- **"The *Zheng Yi Fa Wen (正一法文)** upholds the **Moral Dao (宗道德)**, venerates the **Three Caverns (崇三洞)**, and comprehensively expounds the **Three Vehicles (徧陈三乘)**."**

The *Tai Ping Jing (太平经)* states: **"Support (辅) means father, and also means to assist (扶)."** Thus, when it speaks of the **Three Great Supports (三太辅)** and the **Three Caverns (三洞)**, it is because their **doctrines and practices mutually assist and complete each other (事用相资成生观解)**, much like a father’s ability to nurture.

Since **sentient beings (众生)** are dull and inferior, they cannot grasp profound teachings. Thus, further explanations and **assistance (翼成)** are needed to make them **manifestly enlightened (显悟)**, which is the meaning of **support (扶赞)**.

Hence, the **Cavern of the Spirit (洞神)** is supported by the *Tai Qing (太清)*, for the **Cavern of the Spirit** summons and controls **ghosts and spirits (鬼神)**, requiring the *Tai Qing* to **preserve the *Tai Yi (太一)** and **administer the Golden Elixir (服御金丹)**, aiding in the accomplishment of the **Way (此道)**, so that its **spiritual efficacy (神用)** may be fully realized.

The **Cavern of the Mysterious (洞玄)** harmonizes **heaven and earth (天安地)**, safeguards the **nation (保国)**, and brings **peace to the people (宁民)**. The *Tai Ping (太平)* scriptures also serve this purpose.

The **Cavern of the True (洞真)** exhibits transformations without limit and **spontaneous divine power (神力自在)**, thus requiring the *Tai Xuan (太玄)* to clarify **emptiness (明空)** and **achieve the Way (道成此行)**. Once the **heart of the Double Mysterious (重玄之心)** is illuminated, the **Way of Ten Thousand Transformations (万变之道)** is accomplished. Therefore, the **Thirty-Nine Precepts (三十九章)** are called the **teachings of the Non-Generated (无生之说)**. The **Xi Sheng Miao Dian (西升妙典)** demonstrates the **supreme principle of entering the Non-Doing (善入无为之宗)** and its **fruition (无为之果)**.

Once one **embodies the Mysterious (体玄)**, one attains the **Way (斯致)**. The **Way of the Non-Generated (无生之道)** is then **penetrated and accomplished (洞遣方成)**.

The *Zheng Yi* comprehensively expounds the **Three Vehicles (三乘)**, for it **fully illuminates the Three Vehicles’ ultimate goals (具经通明三乘之致)**.** *Chen (陈)* means to **elucidate (申)**, for the **common folk (末俗)** are dull in their roots and **confused by the Three Vehicles (迷於三乘)**. The *Zheng Yi* thus **comprehensively elucidates (徧申明)** them.

Moreover, the **Three Caverns (三洞)** collectively constitute the **teaching of the One Vehicle (一乘之教)**. Hence, the *Zheng Yi* states: **"Though the Three Caverns are three, they are **encompassed as one (兼而该之)**—the **Way of the One Vehicle (一乘道)**."**

The *Tai Xuan (太玄)* represents the **Great Vehicle (大乘)**, the *Tai Ping (太平)* the **Middle Vehicle (中乘)**, and the *Tai Qing (太清)* the **Lesser Vehicle (小乘)**. The *Zheng Yi (正一)* encompasses the **Three Vehicles (通於三乘)**.

Again, all teachings originate from **human affairs (人间)**. The **Three Evil Paths (三恶道)** suffer, yet they are not **vessels of the Way (道器)**. Those **bound in the Three Realms (三界)** indulge in **pleasure (着乐)** and cannot advance in their **practice (进修)**. If **sages (圣人)** **dispel the bonds (逐结)** and **ascend to the Heavenly Paths (生天)**, they **personally cultivate and observe (自修观行)** without needing **teachings or precepts (教法)**. If they wish to **hear the teachings (欲闻教)**, they must descend to **human affairs (人间)**. The **Three Pure Ones (三清)** and **Two Responses (二相)** **obtain the Way (得)**, and this is the **teaching beyond words (不言之教)**. Only **humans (人)** are **vessels of the Way (道器)**, the initial stage for **practitioners (造行)**. Therefore, the **manifestation of the Way (显应)** and the **saying of scriptures (说经)** occur in **human affairs (人间)**.

If discussing the **transformation of sages (圣化)**, it is **without fixed form (无定)**, their **changes extraordinary (变转非常)**. Even **heaven and human affairs (天上人间)** lack **constant standards (恒准)**. Yet, they arise from **profound and practical meanings (多实义)**, appealing particularly to those in the **human world (人中)**.

Again, the *Guan Shen Jing (观身经)* states: **"Those who skillfully open the **means (方便)** and **fully expound the ultimate goal (敷究竟)**."**

The *Ben Jie Jing (本际经)* states: **"The term *jie (究)* means to **sever (断)**, and *jing (竟)* means to **exhaust (尽)**."** To **sever all afflictions and habits (断烦恼习)** and **exhaust all defilements (一切皆尽)** is to **fully attain liberation (具足解脱)**, which is called **the ultimate goal (究竟)**.

The *Xuanmen Lun* states: **"Ultimate (究竟)** is the name for discerning success and failure, **means (方便)** is the designation of skillful expedience. With skillful means and conditions, one attains the discernment of success and failure." Hence, the *Shengxuan Jing* states: **"All deeds and transgressions, once completed, return to the One (一)."** It further elaborates: **"The Two Vehicles (二乘) are used as means, the Great Vehicle (大乘) as the ultimate; alternatively, the Three Vehicles (三乘) are means, the One Vehicle (一乘) the ultimate. Even the One and the Three are both means, while neither One nor Three is the ultimate."** Thus, whether in **transformation of the master (化主)**, **transformation of the place (化处)**, **transformation of the method (化法)**, or **transformation of the conditions (化缘)**, all are **means and ultimate (方便究竟)**.

Again, according to the *Ling Shu Jing*: **"The Lord of Primordial Beginning (元始天尊) instructed the Celestial Sovereign of the Highest Dao (太上道君): In the era of Longhan (龙汉), I existed as Formless and perpetually abiding, teaching and transforming the world after emerging from seclusion. After my departure, countless kalpas passed without illumination, until the time of Chimi (赤明), when I again descended, assuming the title of the Nameless Sovereign (无名之君), and propagated the **Numinous Treasure teachings (灵宝教化)**. By the time of Kaihuang (开皇), the **Numinous Treasure True Texts (灵宝真文)** opened the Three Symbols (三象), and I, in the Primordial Azure Heaven (始青天中), took the title of **Lord of Primordial Beginning (元始天尊)**, now expounding this scripture to **deliver those who can be delivered (度可度之人)**. Thus, at the dawn of this kalpa, the Celestial Sovereign was the **orthodox teacher (教主)**. By the time of the **Supreme Sovereign’s first year (上皇元年)**, he abdicated to the **Celestial Sovereign of the Highest Dao (太上道君)**, becoming the **Celestial Flower King (天花王)** of today. Hence, the *Benxing Jing* states: *'At the opening of Chimi, the year was Jiazi (甲子), born in the Floating Knife (浮刀).'* Indeed, the **Heavenly Western That-Na-Yu Kingdom (天西那玉国)** and the **Numinous Treasure** both emerged to deliver beings.

The **Lord of Primordial Beginning**, through my merit of **causal conditions (因缘之勋)**, bestowed upon me the title of **Celestial Sovereign of the Highest Dao (太上)**, and sealed me as the **Celestial Emperor of Idyllic Joy, Linchang, and the Jade Terrace (郁悦那林昌玉台天帝王)**, ascending to the rank of **Highest Sage (高圣)**, governing the **Mystic Capital of Jade (玄都玉京)**. This **Chimi (赤明)** refers to the **opening of this kalpa’s diagram (今劫开图)**, not the previous Chimi kalpa. The term ‘Supreme Sovereign (上皇)’ is not mentioned, as it encompasses the entire present kalpa."

**The Twelfth Division Doctrine (十二部义), Seventh Doctrine (第七义):**
The **Twelve Divisions (十二部)** encompass **seven textual categories (文该七部)**, their **doctrinal essence (义本三乘)** transcending life and death in **profound analysis (穷理)**, and entering **constant bliss (常乐)** through awakening—this is their ultimate aim. The *Zhengyi Jing* states: **"The three vehicles (三乘) each cultivate the Twelve Divisions."** The *Benjie Jing* states: **"The totality of the **Dharma gates (法门)** consists of twelve matters; their classifications vary according to the roots of beings."**

**Explication:**
The **doctrine of the Twelve Divisions (十二部义)** applies universally to the **three vehicles (三乘)**. Following the *Benjie Jing*, the divisions are as follows:
1. **Root Text (本文)** – The scriptures of the **Three Primordials and Eight Assemblies (三元八会)**, exemplifying the **long discourses on origins (长行源起之例)**.
   The *Zhenke* (by **Purple Cloud Lady, 紫微夫人**) states: **"The scriptures of the Three Primordials and Eight Assemblies are used by the Highest True Ones (太极高真)."** *Root (本)* signifies **origin (始)** and **foundation (根)**—the **beginning of scriptures and the root of texts**; it also embodies **the principle of non-being (理之无)** and the **source of all dharmas (万法之本)**. *Text (文)* signifies **division (分)** and **articulation of principles (能诠理)**—capable of distinguishing the **Two Polarities (二仪)**, differentiating **dharmas and their marks (法相)**, resolving **all affairs (万事)**, and expounding **ultimate truth (至理)**.

2. **Divine Symbols (神符)** – The **dragon-script and phoenix-seal writings (龙章凤篆)**, the **numinous traces and talismanic characters (灵迹符书)**.
   *Divine (神)* denotes **inexplicability (不测)**; *symbol (符)* refers to **verification (符契)**—these **numinous traces and divine functions (灵迹神用)** are boundless in benefiting sentient beings, like verified contracts.

3. **Jade Keys (玉诀)** – The **Riverbank Master’s (河上公) elucidation of the Gizhu texts (柱下之文)**, the **Jade Keys interpreting the Golden Scriptures (玉诀解金书之例)**.
   *Jade (玉)* signifies **unstained purity (无染)**; *key (诀)* denotes **unambiguous speech (不疑)**—referring to **definitive knowledge without doubt or defilement**.

4. **Numinous Diagrams (灵图)** – Such as the **Five Emperors’ images from Shejing (舍景五帝之象)** and the **tripartite unity diagrams (图局三一之形)**.
   *Diagram (图)* means **measurement (度)**—to **transcribe the profound mysteries (玄妙)** and transmit them to future ages.

5. **Genealogies (谱录)** – Such as the **divine records of the Three Sovereigns’ original conduct (三君本行)**, as chronicled in the **Five Emperors’ annals (陈五帝)**.
   *Genealogy (谱)* means **thread (绪)**; *record (录)* means **documentation (记)**—to **chronicle the sages (绪记圣人)** as **teachings and methods (以为教法)**, also to **trace their origins (绪其元起)** and **ensure continuity (使物录持)**.

6. **Precepts and Statutes (戒律)** – Such as the **examples of the six emotions and ten evils (六情十恶)**.
   *Precept (戒)* signifies **release (解)**, **boundary (界)**, and **restraint (止)**—capable of **dissolving the bonds of evil (解众恶之缚)**, **distinguishing good and evil (分善恶之界)**, and **preventing wrongdoing (防止诸恶)**.
   *Statute (律)* signifies **regulation (率)**, **rectitude (直)**, and **awe (栗)**—to **reckon transgressions (率计罪愆)**, act **without bias (直而不枉)**, and inspire **fear and reverence (使惧栗)**.

7. **Awe and Etiquette (威仪)** – Such as the **rituals of fasting (斋法典式)** and the **ceremonial procedures for scripture invocation (请经轨仪)**.
   *Awe (威)* is **solemn and formidable (俨嶷可畏)**; *etiquette (仪)* is **proper conduct (轨式所宜)**—also **adapting to circumstances (曲从物宜)** to establish **authoritative measures (为威制)**.

8. **Methods (方法)** – Such as **preserving the Three Guardians and Unifying the One (存三守一)**, **restraining the spirit and confining the soul (制魄拘魂)**.
   *Method (方)* refers to **specific practice (方所)**; *way (法)* refers to **regulation (节度)**—clarifying that **cultivation and self-governance (修行治身)** have **specific practices and regulations**.

9. **Multifarious Techniques (众术)** – Such as **alchemical transformations (变丹炼石化形)**, **hidden manifestations (隐景)**.
   *Multifarious (众)* means **many (多)**; *technique (术)* means **Dao (道)**—**varied paths of cultivation (修炼多途)** as the **initial Dao of entering Truth (为入真初道)**.

10. **Records and Transmissions (记传)** – Such as the **Celestial Sovereign’s original conduct (道君本业)** and the **exemplary deeds of the Imperial Person (皇人往行)**.
    *Record (记)* means **memorialization (志)**; *transmission (传)* means **propagation (传)**—to **record the original conduct (记志本业)** and **demonstrate to posterity (传示后人)**.

11. **Praise and Ode (赞颂)** – Such as the **new hymns to the Five True Ones (五真新颂)** and the **ancient chapters of the Nine Heavens (九天旧章)**.
    *Praise (赞)* **expresses deeds (表事)**; *ode (颂)* **sings of virtue (歌德)**. Hence, poetry states: **"An ode (颂)** is the **embellishment of great virtue (美盛德之形容)**; also called a **gāthā (偈)**, meaning **rest (憩)**, referring to **four- or five-character stanzas (四字五字)** as **moments of repose (为憩息之意)**."

12. **Chapters and Memorials (章表)** – Such as the **nine-day fasting petitions (九斋启愿)** and the **three assemblies of homage (三会谒请)**.

「章，明也。 **Tablets (章)** are **illuminations (明)**.
表，奏也。 **Memorials (表)** are **petitions (奏)**.
謂申明心事，上奏大道之。 **They serve to declare one’s sincere intentions (申明心事)** and to **petition the Dao/Way (上奏大道)**.

通言部者，以部类為義，亦以部別為名，謂別其義類，以相從也。 **The term "category" (部) derives from classification (部类) and is also used to distinguish categories (部別)**—to **separate their meanings (別其義類)** and **align them accordingly (以相從)**.

又十二部由序者，按《靈寶真文》上卷云：本文名空陣赤書，景皇真文，初應唯是一文之經，隨五帝所掌，開為五篇。
**The Twelve Daoist Categories (十二部)**, as explained in the *Lingbao Zhenwen* (《靈寶真文》) upper scroll: The original text is called the **Vacuous Array of the Red Script (空陣赤書)**, the **Sacred Daoist Text of the Radiant Sovereign (景皇真文)**. Initially, it was **a single scripture (一文之經)**, later divided into **five sections (五篇)** according to the **Five Celestial Emperors (五帝)**.

東方安寶華林青靈始老帝君，名靈威仰，所掌真文名曰生神寶真洞玄章。
**The Eastern Celestial Emperor (東方)**, **Lord of the Azure Spirit and the First Elder (青靈始老)**, named **Lord of the Sacred Awe (靈威仰)**, whose **Sacred Daoist Text (真文)** is called the **Chapter of the Primordial Spirit’s Treasure (生神寶真洞玄章)**.

南方梵寶昌陽丹靈真老帝君，名赤熛弩，所掌真文名曰南雲通天寶衿。
**The Southern Celestial Emperor (南方)**, **Lord of the Vermilion Spirit and the True Elder (丹靈真老)**, named **Lord of the Scarlet Radiance (赤熛弩)**, whose **Sacred Daoist Text (真文)** is called the **Treasure of the South Cloud’s Celestial Passage (南雲通天寶衿)**.

中央玉寶元靈元老帝君，名含樞紐，所掌真文名曰寶劫洞清九天書。
**The Central Celestial Emperor (中央)**, **Lord of the Jade Treasure and the Primordial Spirit (玉寶元靈)**, named **Lord of the Inclusive Pivot (含樞紐)**, whose **Sacred Daoist Text (真文)** is called the **Book of the Nine Heavens: The Jade Treasure’s Effortless Clarity (寶劫洞清九天書)**.

西方七寶金門皓靈皇老帝君，名曜魄寶，所掌真文名曰金真寶明洞微篇。
**The Western Celestial Emperor (西方)**, **Lord of the Seven Treasures, Golden Gate, and the Luminous Spirit (七寶金門皓靈皇老)**, named **Lord of the Resplendent Essence (曜魄寶)**, whose **Sacred Daoist Text (真文)** is called the **Golden Daoist Text: The Treasure’s Illuminating Effortless Clarity (金真寶明洞微篇)**.

北方洞陰朔單郁絕五靈玄老帝君，名葉光紀，所掌真文名曰元神生真寶明文。
**The Northern Celestial Emperor (北方)**, **Lord of the Vacuous Spirit, the Five Mysterious Elders (五靈玄老)**, named **Lord of the Leafing Radiance (葉光紀)**, whose **Sacred Daoist Text (真文)** is called the **Primordial Spirit’s Living Daoist Text (元神生真寶明文)**.

五老玉篇，皆空洞自然之文也。
**The Five Elderly Jade Scriptures (五老玉篇)** are all **texts of vacuous, effortless, and natural Dao (空洞自然之文)**.

今泛論古今變文，凡有六種：一者天書。
**In general, the evolution of Daoist texts (變文) across ages** encompasses **six types (六種)**. The first is **Heavenly Scriptures (天書)**.

陰陽初分，有三元五德八會之義，以成飛天之書，後撰為八龍雲篆明光之章。
When **Yin and Yang first divided (陰陽初分)**, the **principles of Three Primordials (三元)**, **Five Virtues/Powers (五德)**, and **Eight Convergences (八會)** arose, **forming the Flying Heavenly Texts (飛天之書)**. Later, they were compiled into the **Eight Dragon Cloud Scriptures: The Illuminating Tablets (八龍雲篆明光之章)**.

陸先生解三才，謂之三元。 三元既立，五行咸具，以五行为位，三五相合，謂之八會，為眾書之元。
**Master Lu (陸先生)** interprets **the Three Realms (三才)** as the **Three Primordials (三元)**. Once the **Three Primordials (三元)** were established, the **Five Phases (五行)** were complete, **positioned by the Five Phases (五行为位)**. The **interaction of three and five (三五相合)** forms the **Eight Convergences (八會)**, which are the **foundation of all scriptures (眾書之元)**.

又有八龍雲篆明光之章，自然飛玄之義，結空成文，字方一丈，肇於未天之內，生立一切也。
There are also the **Eight Dragon Cloud Scriptures: The Illuminating Tablets (八龍雲篆明光之章)**, which embody the **effortless, soaring Dao (自然飛玄之義)**. They **are formed by the condensation of vacuity (結空成文)**, with **characters square as a zhang (字方一丈)**, originating **within the Unmanifested Heaven (未天之內)** and **giving rise to all things (生立一切)**.

按《真誥》紫微夫人說：三元八會建文章之祖，八龍雲篆是其根宗所起，有書之始。
According to **Lady Zimwei’s discourse in the *Zhen Ga* (《真誥》紫微夫人說)**, the **Three Primordials and Eight Convergences (三元八會)** are the **ancestors of all scriptures (文章之祖)**. The **Eight Dragon Cloud Scriptures (八龍雲篆)** are their **root lineage (根宗)**, marking the **origin of Heavenly Scriptures (有書之始)**.

而先生云：八會，三才五行便是，既判之後。
Yet **Master Lu (先生)** states: **The Eight Convergences (八會)** are simply **the Three Realms and Five Phases (三才五行)**. After their **distinction (既判)**.

赤書又云靈寶赤書五篇真文，出於元始之前。
The **Red Scriptures (赤書)** also state: **The Five Sacred Daoist Texts of Lingbao (靈寶赤書五篇真文)** emerged **before the Primordial Beginning (元始之前)**.

即此而論，三元應非三才，五篇應非五行也。
**From this perspective**, the **Three Primordials (三元)** should **not be identical to the Three Realms (三才)**, and the **Five Scriptures (五篇)** should **not be identical to the Five Phases (五行)**.

正應是三寶文人之三炁，三炁自有五德耳。
**Rather, they correspond to the Three Spirits (三炁) of the Three Treasures (三寶)**. The **Three Spirits (三炁)** inherently possess **Five Virtues/Powers (五德)**.

故《九天生神章經》云：天地萬化，自非三元所育，九炁所導，莫能生也。
Thus, the *Nine-Heaven Primordial Spirit Chapter Scripture (九天生神章經)* says:
**"The myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth (天地萬化)** are **not produced by the Three Primordials (三元所育)** nor **guided by the Nine Spirits (九炁所導)**—nothing can **give rise to life (莫能生)**."

故知三元在天地未開，三才未有之前也。
**Hence, it is known that the Three Primordials (三元)** exist **before Heaven and Earth opened (天地未開)** and **before the Three Realms came into being (三才未有)**.

三元者，一曰混洞太無元，高上玉皇之炁；
二曰赤混太無元，上玉虚之炁；
三曰冥寂玄通，無上玉虚之炁。
**The Three Primordials (三元)** are:
1. **The Primordial of Vacuous and Effortless Supreme Non-Being (混洞太無元)**, the **Spirit of the Highest Jade Sovereign (高上玉皇之炁)**;
2. **The Primordial of Scarlet Vacuity and Supreme Non-Being (赤混太無元)**, the **Spirit of the Upper Jade Emptiness (上玉虚之炁)**;
3. **The Primordial of Silent Darkness and Mysterious Passage (冥寂玄通)**, the **Spirit of the Supreme Jade Emptiness (無上玉虚之炁)**.

五德所本有三，即陰陽和。
**The Five Virtues/Powers (五德)** derive from **three foundations (所本有三)**, namely **Yin, Yang, and Harmony (陰陽和)**.

陰有少陰、太陰，陽有少陽、太陽，就和中之和為五德也。
**Yin includes the Lesser Yin (少陰) and Greater Yin (太陰)**;
**Yang includes the Lesser Yang (少陽) and Greater Yang (太陽)**.
**Within Harmony (和)**, the **Harmony of Harmony (就和中之和)** constitutes the **Five Virtues/Powers (五德)**.

篆者，撰集靈書謂之雲篆。
**Scriptures (篆)** are **compilations of the Mysterious Daoist Texts (撰集靈書)**, also called **Cloud Scriptures (雲篆)**.

此則三元八會之文，皆是天書也。
**These texts of the Three Primordials and Eight Convergences (三元八會之文)** are all **Heavenly Scriptures (天書)**.

二者演八會為龍鳳之文，謂之地書，此下玄聖所述，以寫天文也。
The second type is **the Dragon and Phoenix Texts (龍鳳之文)**, derived from the **Eight Convergences (八會)**, called **Earthly Scriptures (地書)**. This refers to **the teachings of the Lower Mysterious Sage (下玄聖)** and is used to **transcribe Heavenly Scriptures (寫天文)**.

三者軒轅之時，苍頡傍龍鳳之勢，採鳥跡為古文，以代結繩，即古體也。
The third type is **the Ancient Script (古文)**, which **Cangjie (苍頡)** modeled after **the Dragon and Phoenix forms (龍鳳之勢)** during the **reign of Emperor Xuanxu (軒轅之時)**. He **adopted bird tracks (採鳥跡)** to replace **knotted cords (結繩)**, marking the **origin of ancient writing (古體)**.

四者周時，史籀變古文為大篆。
The fourth type is **the Great Seal Script (大篆)**, which **Master Shi Shu (史籀)** transformed from **Ancient Script (古文)** during the **Zhou Dynasty (周時)**.

五者秦時，程邈變大篆為小篆。
The fifth type is **the Small Seal Script (小篆)**, which **Master Cheng Man (程邈)** transformed from **the Great Seal Script (大篆)** during the **Qin Dynasty (秦時)**.

六者秦後，盱陽變小篆為隸書。
The sixth type is **the Clerical Script (隸書)**, which **Master Xu Yang (盱陽)** transformed from **the Small Seal Script (小篆)** after the **Qin Dynasty (秦後)**.

又云：漢謂隸書曰佐書，或言程邈狱中所造，出於徒隸，故以隸為名。
It is also said that **the Han Dynasty (漢)** referred to **Clerical Script (隸書)** as **Assistant Script (佐書)**. Some claim it was **created by Master Cheng Man in prison (程邈狱中所造)** and **originated from scribes (徒隸)**, hence its name.

是為六文也。
**These are the Six Scriptures (六文)**.

又有八體六書，今不具叙耳。
There are also **the Eight Forms and Six Principles of Writing (八體六書)**, but **their details are omitted here (今不具叙)**.

又漢和帝時，蔡倫始造紙，爾前唯書簡牒。
During the **reign of Emperor He of the Han Dynasty (漢和帝時)**, **Cai Lun (蔡倫)** first **created paper (造紙)**. Before that, **only writing tablets and slips (書簡牒)** existed.

牒者，訓牒語事。
**Slips (牒)** are **for recording and declaring words (訓牒語事)**.

簡者，在簡不繁。
**Tablets (簡)** are **concise and written on bamboo or wood (在簡不繁)**.

但知本是天書，以下八體六文，皆從真文出耳。
**It is known that the original form is Heavenly Scripture (天書)**, and **the subsequent Eight Forms and Six Scriptures (八體六文)** all **emanate from the Sacred Daoist Texts (真文)**.

又蒙恬造筆精能，故稱蒙恬造筆也。
**Meng Tian (蒙恬)** crafted **refined brushes (造筆精能)**, hence the **attribution of the invention of brushes to him (稱蒙恬造筆)**.

然未知何時書經於紙卷。
**However, it is unclear when scriptures were first written on paper rolls (何時書經於紙卷)**.

今謂劫初已自有筆，太真所書，何容無紙，及以八體六文等耶？
**Now, it is said that brushes already existed at the beginning of the kalpa (劫初)**. **The Supreme Daoist Sage (太真)** wrote with them—**how could there be no paper (何容無紙)** or **the Eight Forms and Six Scriptures (及以八體六文)**?

以天尊造化，具一切法故也，但後人承用，自有前後耳。
**It is because the Heavenly Sovereign (天尊)** created all things **with complete laws (具一切法)**. Yet **later generations (後人)** adopted these practices **in sequence (承用自有前後)**.

神符者，明一切萬有，莫不以精炁為用，故二儀三景，皆以精炁行乎其中。
**Divine Talismans (神符)** are **illuminations of all myriad things (明一切萬有)**. **Nothing exists without the application of refined *qi* (精炁)**. Thus, **the Two Complementaries (二儀)** and **the Three Manifestations (三景)** all **operate through refined *qi* (精炁行乎其中)**.

萬物既有，亦以精炁行乎其中也。
**Once all things came into being (萬物既有)**, they too **function through refined *qi* (精炁行乎其中)**.

是則五行六物，莫不有精炁也。
**Therefore, the Five Phases (五行) and Six Categories (六物)** all **possess refined *qi* (精炁)**.

以道之精炁布之簡墨，會物之精炁以卻邪妄，輔助真教，召會群靈，制御生死，保持劫運，安鎮五方。
**The refined *qi* of the Dao (道之精炁)** is **applied to ink (布之簡墨)**. **The refined *qi* of all things (會物之精炁)** is used to:
**repel falsehoods (卻邪妄)**,
**assist the True Teachings (輔助真教)**,
**convoke all spirits (召會群靈)**,
**control life and death (制御生死)**,
**preserve the kalpas (保持劫運)**

The **Essence of Jade (玉诀)** is a separate text with two volumes. The **Celestial Sovereign of the Dao (太上道君)** in the **Southern Dan [Dungeon] (南丹)**, at the **Upper Hall of Yang (洞阳上馆)**, bestowed upon the scholar **Wang Long (王龙)** the **mystic script of the Jade Characters (灵文玉字之诀)**. It merely seeks to clarify the **epoch in which the Essence of Jade was inscribed (何代所注)**.

He further stated that all **rituals of talismans and offerings (修符醮)**, including **invocations for the Five Directions (五方)**, **meditation on the Five Directions for disaster transference (思存移灾)**, and other such methods, are **precisely the texts that elucidate the Essence of Jade’s eightfold [principles] (解诀八会之文)**.

The **Mystic Diagram (灵图)** is transmitted as **having form (有)**; the **Script (书)** is transmitted as **without form (无)**.
**Without form (无)** means **speech and principle lack tangible traces (言之与理无有形迹)**, as in the **method of fixing the mind to visualize diagrams (定志图局之例)**.
**With form (有)** refers to **visible shapes and traces (有形之与迹)**, such as **the Eight Scenes (八景)** and **human and avian figures (人鸟之例)**.

Some [talismans] **subdue the Five Sacred Mountains (镇之五岳)**, **preserve and govern the kalpas (保制劫运)**; others **extend their influence to the Ten Directions (广被十方)**, **enlighten all beings universally (开化周普)**. Some **proclaim the teachings of antiquity (宣之上古)**, **dispelling the confusions of all things (极物之迷)**; others **transmit to the later ages (传之下世)**, **relieving the suffering of all things (哀物之苦)**. All these are **manifestations of the Great Compassion (大慈之德)**, **tailoring methods to the afflictions (随病设方)**, and **expressions of the Great Mercy’s intent (大哀之心)**, **delivering dharma according to karmic affinity (赴缘说法)**.

**Recordings (谱录)** have two applications:
**The Register (谱)** is like the **Chapter on Nurturing the Spirits (生神章)**, where the **Three Treasures (三宝)** and the **Sovereigns of the Dao’s own path (本行道君)** detail the **preordained roots of past lives (自序宿世根本之例)**.
**The Ledger (录)** involves **recording the names and ranks of divine true forms (修别神真位次名)**, as well as **the Eight Scenes (八景)** and **internal phonetic [principles] (内音之例)**.
The **Register’s purpose (谱之用)** is to **explain the origin and fundamental causes of birth and death (述源本宿因)** to beings who claim **life and death are without cause (或谓生死之理，欻然而有，欻然而无)**, akin to **grass and trees, which arise without karmic conditions (如彼草木，无所缘起)**, so that they may **awaken to their true nature (令其得悟)**.
The **Ledger’s purpose (录)** is to **record the names of divine ranks (修牒名领)**, **entrusting them to disciples (以付学人)** so that they may **retain and ponder them (领录存思)**, **self-protect and ascend (以自防保)**, **and elevate the human body to heaven (共举人身以升天)**.

**Precepts and Ordinances (戒律)** have their own distinctions:
**Precepts (戒)**, meaning **restraint (止)**, and **dharma for goodness (法善)**, entail **restraining evil thoughts and speech (止恶心口)** and **vowing not to commit evil (为誓不作恶)**. Their **scope varies between detailed and brief (详略)**.
**Detailed precepts (详)** include:
- The **Dao Precepts of the Great Purity (太清道本)**, with **Limitless Dharma Gates (无量法门)** and **129 articles (百二十九条)**;
- The **180 precepts of Laozi and the Three Primordial Ones (老君及三元品戒百八十条)**;
- The **300 precepts of the Great Contemplation of the Body (观身大戒三百条)**;
- The **60 precepts of the Supreme Unity (太一六十戒之例)**.

**Brief precepts (略)** include:
- The **Three Daoist Precepts (道民三戒)**;
- The **Five Precepts for the Recorded (录生五戒)**;
- The **Eight Precepts for the Ritual Officer (祭酒八戒)**;
- The **Nine Precepts of Contemplation (想尔九戒)**;
- The **Ten Precepts of Supreme Wisdom (智慧上品十戒)**;
- The **Twenty-Four Precepts of Illuminating the True (明真二十四戒之例)**.

**Ordinations (律)** are **finalized within precepts (终出戒中)**, without further subdivisions, **focusing on classifications of sins, retributions, and penal codes (多论罪报刑宪之科)**, such as **the Heavenly Master’s Ordination on Subduing Demons (天师制鬼)** and **the Ordination of the Mystic Capital’s Female Immortals (玄都女青等律)**.
Thus, **precepts govern the cause (戒主於因)**, while **ordinations govern the result (律主於果)**—**precepts are for preventing evil (以戒论防恶)**, and **ordinations are for restraining crimes (律论止罪)**.

**Awe and Ritual (威仪)** originally had **threefold ritual standards (三元本有威仪)**, including **postures of reverence and humility (俯仰之格)**. There were **3,400 [such standards] (三千四百)**. After the **Dragon Han [dynasty] (龙汉)**, the texts became **incomplete (文多不备)**, and since **the end times are unbearable (末世不堪)**, these standards are **omitted and not transmitted (故略不传)**.

The **discourse on fasting and its merits (斋功德)** comprises two categories: **attaining the Dao (极道)** and **delivering beings (济度)**.
**Attaining the Dao (极道)**:
The *Dongshen Jing* (洞神经) states: **"The fasting of the mind is seated in forgetfulness (心斋坐忘)**, reaching the **ultimate of the Dao (至极道矣)**."**
The *Benjie Jing* (本际经) states: **"The fasting of the mind is seated in forgetfulness (心斋坐忘), wandering in emptiness and walking in the void (游空飞步)**."**

**Delivering beings (济度)** follows the **three registers and seven grades (三箓七品)** as scripted:
The **three registers (三箓)** are:
1. The **Golden Register Fast (金箓斋)**, **warding off celestial calamities (上消天灾)**, **protecting and stabilizing the emperor (保镇帝王)**.
2. The **Jade Register Fast (玉箓斋)**, **rescuing and delivering the people (救度人民)**, **invoking blessings and expressing gratitude (请福谢过)**.
3. The **Yellow Register Fast (黄箓斋)**, **extracting beings from the nine depths of hell (下拔地狱九玄之苦)**.

The **seven grades (七品)** are:
1. The **Three Sovereigns Fast (三皇斋)**, **seeking immortality and preserving the state (求仙保国)**.
2. The **Natural Fast (自然斋)**, **cultivating the True and learning the Dao (修真学道)**.
3. The **Upper Purity Fast (上清斋)**, **ascending the void and entering the marvelous (升虚入妙)**.
4. The **Instruction Fast (指教斋)**, **warding off disasters and curing illnesses (禳灾救疾)**.
5. The **Coal Fast (涂炭斋)**, **repenting sins and petitioning for life (悔过请命)**.
6. The **Illumination of the True Fast (明真斋)**, **extracting souls from the nine abysses (拔九幽之魂)**.
7. The **Three Primordial Ones Fast (三元斋)**, **atoning for offenses against the Three Officials (谢三官之罪)**.

These **various fasts (此等诸斋)** are performed for **one day and night (一日一夜)**, **three days and nights (三日三夜)**, or **seven days and nights (七日七夜)**, **according to the ritual procedures (具如仪轨)**.
Additionally, there are **other fasts (其外)**, such as the **six fasts and ten straight days (六斋十直)**,
**the fasts of the first day of the first, fourth, and seventh months (甲子庚申)**,
**the fasts of the eight seasonal festivals (八节本命)**,
**the fasts of the hundred days and thousand days (百日千日)**,
all **employing natural methods (通用自然之法)**.

The **six fast months (六斋月)** are:
**the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months (正月、三月、五月、七月、九月、十一月)**.
There are also **three long fast months (三长斋月)**, namely:
**the first, seventh, and tenth months (正月、七月、十月)**.

The **ten straight days (十直)** are:
**the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of the month (月一日、八日、十四日、十五日、十八日、二十三日、二十四日、二十八日、二十九日、三十日)**.

The **six fasts and eight seasonal festivals (六斋八节)** can be understood as follows, though their **full methods are not detailed here (可知，今不具辩方法者)**. In summary, there are **nine [fast principles] (大略有九)**:
1. **Coarse grains, such as millet and barley (粗食麻麦)**.
2. **Vegetables and grains (蔬食菜茹)**.
3. **Moderate meals (节食中食)**.
4. **Ingesting talismans, ritual waters, and elixirs (服饵符水及丹英)**.
5. **Ingesting sprouts (服芽)**, known as **sprouts of the Five Directions (五方云芽)**.
6. **Ingesting light (服光)**, referring to **the light of the sun, moon, and seven stars (日月七元三光)**.
7. **Ingesting *qi* (服炁)**, meaning **the *qi* of the Six Awakenings (六觉之炁)** and **the wondrous *qi* of the four cardinal directions of heaven and earth (天地四方之妙炁)**.
8. **Ingesting primordial *qi* (服元炁)**, meaning **the primordial *qi* of all things (一切所禀三元之炁)**, **the essence of the Great Harmony (太和之精)**, **residing within the Great Void (在乎太虚)**.
9. **Fetal fasting (胎食)**, meaning **the harmonized essence of my own attainment (我自所得元精之和)**, **the primordial essence of the womb (为胞胎之元)**, **the *qi* of the Dao descending into the four limbs (即清虚降四体之炁)**, **no longer connected to the external world (不复关外)**.

**Coarse grains** serve to **restrain indulgent cravings (止诸耽嗜)**.
**Vegetables and grains** help to **moderate richness and fat (省诸肥腴)**.
**Moderate meals** eliminate **disturbances and turbidity (除烦恼浊)**.
**Preserving the essence** is **to perfect the body and spirit (保精所以具身神)**, **to cultivate the luster of the true form (体成英华)**.

**Ingesting sprouts** is **to transform into sprouts (服芽所以变为芽)**.
**Ingesting light** is **to transform into light (服光所以变为光)**.
**Ingesting the Six *qi*** is **to transmute into the Six *qi* (服六炁所以化为六炁)**, **wandering through the Ten Directions (游乎十方)**.
**Ingesting primordial *qi*** is **to transmute into primordial *qi* (服元炁化为元炁)**, **merging with the body of heaven and earth (与天地合体)**.
**Ingesting fetal *qi*** is **to revert to infancy (食胎炁所以反为婴童)**, **uniting with the Dao to become one (与道混合为一)**.

These **transformations and changes (此之变化)** are **successive and mutable (迭运改易)**, **not abandoning the body to receive another (不复舍身而更受身)**, **and traversing life and death (往来生死)**.

Now, the methods and techniques are not merely limited to dietary practices—one may also seek them through elixirs, alchemical medicines, or massage and other such arts.

The preceding accounts are drawn from the *Ling Book* (*Ling Shu*) and the *Zhen Inception Scriptures* (*Zhen Inception Jing*), as well as the teachings transmitted by Master Pei when he received the Dao. The myriad arts of the adept encompass all possibilities, and broadly speaking, they may be categorized into five key practices:

1. **Cultivating the spirit and preserving the true self** (思神存真).
2. **Heart fasting and seated oblivion** (心斋坐忘).
3. **Treading the void and flying through the sky** (步虚飞空).
4. **Feasting on and absorbing the Six *qi*** (餐吸六炁).
5. **Guiding and drawing the Three Lights** (导引三光).

All these are governed by the interplay of heart-*qi* and the mysterious communion of the Dao.

As for their transformations, there are three primary manifestations:

1. **Ascending to Heaven in broad daylight.**
   When one’s practice is complete and the Dao is perfected, the thirty-six thousand deities and the Three-One Emperor merge into a single body, achieving the wondrous unity. Thus, they ascend to Heaven with their divine forms intact, their bodies ascending while still alive.

2. **Corpse dissolution (尸解).**
   Sometimes, substitutes like swords, bamboo, or wood are used in place of the body, which then suddenly ascends, vanishing without trace. Alternatively, only the skin and husk remain, or the body is buried, but upon opening the coffin, only a staff and sandals are found. Some may wander the Five Sacred Peaks, while others ascend directly to Heaven. In the Southern Palace lies the Hall of Flowing Fire, and at the Golden Gate flows the Water of Refining—those who ascend while alive first refine their form and spirit in the Hall of Fire, while those who ascend after death first refine their soul and corpse in the Hall’s pool. All this depends on their merit and attainment.

3. **Transcendence and liberation (灭度).**
   The corpse does not decay into ash, as seen in the case of Taiyi guarding the corpse, where the body may remain intact for years before returning to human form.

Records and transmissions either trace past events or foretell future ones. *Transmissions* refer to the compilation and continuation of such accounts.

The bodies of the saints and true ones may be broadly categorized into two origins:
1. **Natural attainment** (自然).
2. **Learned cultivation** (学得).

The *Great Cavern Scripture* (*Da Dong Jing*) states:
*"Those who obtain the Cavern Scripture gain life from death, the Dao from life, immortality from the Dao, the True from immortality, and the Supreme Clarity from the True."*

The Yellow Old Master, the Thirty-Nine True Ones, the Twenty-Four Emperors, the One Hundred and Eighty Dao Lords, and the Heavenly Venerable Saints—some possess innate wondrous *qi*, acting through transformation, while others achieve enlightenment through cultivation. Both paths ultimately converge into one.

However, these sacred stages encompass myriad branches and schools, which shall not be fully expounded here.

**Praise and hymns** follow structured forms: four-character lines symbolize the Four Seasons and Four *Qi*, five-character lines align with the Five Phases and Five Virtues, and seven-character lines correspond to the Seven Primordials and Seven Celestial Luminaries. The original hymns trace the descent of divine spirits from the Nine Heavens, infused with the *qi* of the Three Caverns and the soaring mysteries. Later scriptures may include hymns by Dao Lords, True Persons, or celestial beings—all composed by the Mysterious Saints and preserved within the texts.

**Chapters and memorials** serve to standardize diverse practices. Though all affairs of the myriad affairs differ in form, the Sage established laws to govern them. Since the Dao resides in the human heart, yet one must still present petitions when unable to intuitively grasp its depths, the outward expression of these rites clarifies the heart. Thus, the forms are exhausted, and the human and divine unite in harmony.

The *Chapter of Faith and Oaths* (*Zhang Xin Ke*) states:
*"Offerings clarify faith—faith in the Dao leads to renunciation of wealth, dispelling calamities and resolving misfortunes. Its essence lies in twofold practice: first, bestowing upon the common folk, extending compassion even to birds and beasts, all creatures sharing the same origin. Second, venerating the Three Venerable Ones, upholding the Three Treasures, and providing for sages and worthies, offering daily reverence as one would to the heavens."*

Thus concludes Volume Two of the *Principles of Daoist Teachings* (*Dao Jiao Yi Gu*).

#1 **Ge Fa** (葛法): Should be rendered as **"Ge Xuan" (葛玄)**.

**Volume Three of the *Dao Jiao Yi Gu* (道教义枢)**, compiled by Daoist priest Meng An (孟安) of Qingxi (青溪),
**Section Eight: Two-Half Doctrine** (两半义)
**Section Nine: Dao Meaning** (道意义)
**Section Ten: Ten Virtues** (十善义)
**Section Eleven: Cause and Effect** (因果义)

**Section Eight: Two-Half Doctrine**
The meaning of the Two-Half Doctrine (两半义) is as follows: The common folk’s recognition of *karma* (业) originates from the *yīnyūn* (氤氲), then proceeds through contamination and drift, ultimately sinking into confusion and inversion. If one can reverse this process, one returns to the natural state. If one trusts in the flow of *yīnyūn* (氤氲) and remains attached to it, one will inevitably suffer from *guilt* (罪) and *stains* (垢)—this is its consequence.

The *Sutra of Establishing the Will* (*Ding Zhi Jing*, 定志经) states:
*"Two halves unite as one—its meaning encompasses five aspects."*

The *Sutra of the Original Boundary* (*Ben Jie Jing*, 本际经) states:
*"Two halves arise from cause and condition."*

The *Explanation of Names* (*Shi Ming Ti*, 释名体) elaborates:
*"Two" signifies the duality of two, "half" denotes incompleteness, "united" means fulfillment—one phrase encapsulates their union.
To view unity as duality, hence the term "half";
To merge duality into unity, hence the name "united."*

The Five Aspects (五义) of the Two-Half Doctrine are:
The initial arrival of the Five Aspects (初来五义), where *contamination* (染) of the heart becomes its form (体),
And the reversal of the Five Aspects (反出五处), where *unification* (合) of form and heart becomes its essence (体).

The former interpretation states:
*"The Two-Half Doctrine refers to the duality of yin and yang *qi* (炁).*
Yin contains the yin within yin, and yang contains the yang within yang—
When harmonized with the *he qi* (和炁), they fulfill the Five Aspects."*

Upon careful examination of the sutra’s intent, this meaning was not found.
Now, clarifying the *Sutra of Establishing the Will* (定志经), it reveals that the Three *Not* (三不) also elucidate the Five Aspects:

1. The first *Not* (不) clarifies the *flowing desires* (流来通欲) of the Two-Half Doctrine.
2. The second *Not* (不) clarifies the *initial arising of distinct desires* (初起别欲).
3. The third *Not* (不) clarifies the meaning of *reversal* (反出).

The first *Not* (不), which clarifies the *flowing desires* (流来通欲), is precisely the meaning of the Two-Half Doctrine.
Thus, the *flowing desires* (流来通欲) encompass the five aspects of all beings—
That is, the *yīnyūn* (氤氲) outside the *realms* (界) as one half,
And the four contaminations within the *realms* (界) as the other half—
Together forming the *flowing desires* (通欲) as the unity of the two halves.

The five aspects (五品) are:
1. The *yīnyūn* (氤氲) generating outside the Three Realms (三界外).
2. Contamination in the *Formless Realm* (无色界).
3. Contamination in the *Form Realm* (色界).
4. Contamination in the *Realm of Desire* (欲界).
5. Contamination in the *Three Evil Paths* (三恶道).

The desires that arise from this—what are they? The *Sutra of Establishing the Will* (定志经) asks:
*"Is it not that the pure and empty *qi* (清虚之炁) of the divine origin,
Through the interaction of *yīnyūn* (氤氲), descends half as contamination?
Then, merging with the four halves within the realms, does it not form a unified desire?"*

This explains that the divine origin is inherently pure and empty,
Yet the *yīnyūn* (氤氲) arises falsely.
When viewed from the perspective of the realms, the *yīnyūn* (氤氲) is called one half;
When viewed from the perspective of purity, it is also called one half.
Now, speaking of "descending half" (分半下降),
It precisely means dividing the *yīnyūn* (氤氲) of the divine origin from the pure and empty state as the first half outside the realms,
And merging with the four halves within the realms to form a unified *flowing desire* (通欲).

On the day of its initial arrival, there were not yet the Five Aspects—
But upon its reversal, these Five Aspects are verified.
What are they?

When the reversal occurs, it still relies on these aspects for contamination and nourishment,
Thus receiving the corresponding retribution for these aspects.

But in the very first movement,
It is already affliction and karmic action—
Causality unfolds with time,
As karmic deeds flow through the five realms,
From light to heavy, like kinds begetting like,
Thus forming the chain of cause and effect.

Yet if the initial thought arises, what is its cause?
Now it is made clear that inversion generates nothing fundamental.
If there were a fundamental root, how could it be called inversion?

Thus it is known that *yīnyūn* (氤氲) is inversion—
The scriptures say: *"Yīnyūn* (氤氲) is exchange, exchange is confusion,
Just as the meaning of inversion."

This speaks of causality—
It is still inversion that exists,
Hence it is said that the initial thought is already affliction and karmic action.

If so, the scriptures ask: *"Why say the divine origin is serene and pure?
If it is inherently serene and pure, why not take serene purity as the root?"*

Now it is clarified that the scriptures speak of serene purity as the root—
This is to demonstrate that there is no root,
For if there is serene purity, what else could there be?
If there were something else, how could it be called serene purity?

Thus the *Xī Shēng Jīng* (西升经) says:
*"The origin emerges from emptiness—
Once inversion is known, the root is originally nonexistent,
Thus birth and death are originally without beginning.
If the beginning is originally nonexistent, how could there now be an end?"*

Thus the *Méng Wēi Jīng* (盟威经) says:
*"The root of sentient beings has neither beginning nor end,"*
And the *Běn Jiè Jīng* (本际经) says:
*"The fundamental nature of sentient beings is ultimately like empty space—
Delusion enters into birth and death, a dreamlike illusion without beginning or end."*

Now it is said that the Nine Saints mark the end,
And *yīnyūn* (氤氲) marks the beginning—
This is to say that what is not an end is called the end,
And what is not a beginning is called the beginning.

Since what is not a beginning is taken as the beginning,
And what is without root is taken as the root,
It is said to originate from emptiness and serene purity.

Thus the *Běn Jiè Jīng* (本际经) says:
*"Yīn (氤) is cause; yūn (氲) is warmth.
The laws of the world, through the warmth and moistening of qi,
Begin to emerge—
This is the initial thought, where inverted perception first arises,
Its substance most subtle and fleeting, like fine mist,
Capable of obscuring the Dao’s fruit,
Countless in its knowledge and perception,
Serving as the root of birth and death,
Fundamentally unfathomable—
Thus it is called the divine origin.

The divine is but the mind—
The mind possesses nothing, hence it is called serene purity.
Yet it is light delusion, untainted by perception,
Thus it is called *wú zhuó* (无着, ungraspable).*

Secondly, does this not clarify that the initial arising of distinct desire
Has an explanation: distinct desire originates from unified desire,
At its first arising, extremely light,
Equal to the *yīnyūn* (氤氲) that the Four Classes (四民) sever,
Gradually growing heavier, aligning with the five aspects.
If later it regresses, it is as light as the Four Classes,
And if heavy, it is called *xí qì* (习炁, habitual qi),
Arising from *yīnyūn* (氤氲).

Thus it is known that the Four Classes sever *xí qì* (习炁) by right.

But if distinct desire grows heavy,
It invites suffering in the evil paths,
Yet earns light retribution.
Why?
The scriptures say: *"Is it not that, bewildered by this false unity,
One invites the natural qi of evil,
And sinks into the Three Realms of Misery?"*

This clarifies that through unified desire,
False unity arises in distinct desire,
Earning the retribution of the Three Realms of Misery—
Karma naturally invites itself, hence it is called natural.

The term *unified desire* speaks of falsehood—
This is the habitual connection of causes,
A continuous falsehood.

Yet initially, one may generate both evil and good—
Now it is made clear that evil arises spontaneously,
Thus it can arise on its own,
While good arises through cultivation,
Thus it cannot arise spontaneously.

Thirdly, does this not clarify the meaning of reversal?
It means upholding the Five Precepts and other virtues,
Severing half of the evil paths,
Purifying the mouth’s karmic deeds, severing half of the desire realm,
Purifying the body’s karmic deeds, severing half of the form realm,
Purifying the mind’s karmic deeds, severing half of the formless realm.

Having severed the four halves,
One cultivates the observation of desirelessness,
To sever *yīnyūn* (氤氲).
Once severed,
One returns to the original two halves,
Dwelling in the natural, true Dao’s fruit.

Thus the scriptures say: *"Is it not that by doing good,
Severing these four halves,
One ascends to the Great Emptiness,
Restoring one’s serene and pure qi,
Returning to the original two halves,
Dwelling in the natural?"*

This clarifies severing the four contaminations within the realms—
Hence it is said to sever the four halves,
Ascend to the Great Emptiness,
And sever the *yīnyūn* (氤氲) outside the realms;
Hence it is said to restore serene and pure qi,
Return to the original two halves,
And advance to the Dao’s fruit;
Hence it is said to dwell in the natural.

But knowing the Dao’s fruit,
Transcending the root of serene purity—
Why?
The meaning of *yīnyūn* (氤氲) lies in existence,
The meaning of serene purity lies in nonexistence—
If one takes what is without root as the root,
This root, though exhausted, does not fully sever birth and death.
If the meaning is neither existence nor nonexistence,
This is the ultimate.

The *Shēng Xuān Jīng* (升玄经) says:
*"The true Dao is neither not-nonexistent nor existent—
Able to awaken to the two halves, how could it not embody this?"*

But some may calculate and insist on causes and conditions.
Causes have secondary paths—
The primary path is unified desire, where like begets like.
The previous thought is the cause, the subsequent thought the effect,
Sequentially linked, flowing through the five aspects.
Secondary paths are the desires of greed and others,
Arising from unified desire.

**Chapter Nine: The Meaning of the Dao**
The meaning of the Dao is:
Entering the Dao with initial sincerity,
Returning to the true and wondrous essence,
Severing the bonds of birth and death,
Achieving the clarity of wisdom’s mirror,
Cutting off the ferry of desire,
Realizing the fruit of non-doing—
This is its ultimate aim.

**Explanation:**
Summarizing the essence of the scriptures, there are five kinds:

1. **Natural Dao Meaning**
   It refers to the initial awakening of the natural mind,
   Seeking the Dao’s fruit above and transforming sentient beings below—
   The great aspiration of the Way.

   But the name *natural* has two meanings:
   One is that in the present cause, it is natural—
   Meaning karmic deeds unfold naturally, not by external force.
   Two is that the fruit is called natural—
   Meaning the natural true Dao, with transformation and salvation as its intent.
   Those who awaken to this aspiration
   Support the fruit with the cause,
   Hence the fruit is called natural by the cause.

2. **Cultivated Dao Meaning**
   It refers to cultivating to subdue all delusions.
   The *Bā Sù Jīng* (八素经) says:
   *"Gradually advancing in cultivation,
   Turning to attain supreme clarity."*

**3. The True Dao Meaning**
It refers to cultivating true wisdom through practice,
Capable of discerning true principles.

**4. The Liberation Dao Meaning**
It refers to transcending the Three Realms,
Arriving at the Dao’s sacred ground.

**5. The Supreme Dao Meaning**
It refers to wisdom beyond all others,
With no greater penetration.
The term *Dao Meaning* signifies
The mind of the true Dao,
Also the practice of the first four minds,
Attaining the Dao’s fruit thereafter—
Thus, the name *Dao Meaning* is comprehensive.

Moreover, the Supreme Dao Mind
Takes great compassion as its foundation,
Universally saving all beings,
All leading them back to the True.

Now, seeking the Dao’s fruit above
Is the same as returning to the True,
Transforming sentient beings below
Is the same as aiding all things.
Ever sustaining this aspiration,
It aligns with the Dao Mind—
All four meanings employ this mind,
Hence it is called *Dao Meaning*.

Though the Dao Meaning encompasses much,
Here five are outlined:
The first four are causes,
The last is the fruit—
Cause and fruit united,
Thus making five.

---
**The Tenth Chapter: The Meaning of the Ten Virtues**
The meaning is this:
The Ten Virtues stop and extinguish faults and offenses,
Drawing one near to the certitude of human and heavenly realms,
Nurturing life and wisdom for observation,
Far-reaching to attain true sainthood.
If one thoroughly abandons them,
One still tends toward the Dao’s sacred ground,
Not yet empty and forgetful,
But rooted in the dust of mundane concerns—
This is its essence.

The *Ben Jie Jing* (本际经) states:
*"The Five Precepts and Ten Virtues
Gain the seven treasures of the Three Realms as dependent origins."*

**Explanation:**
1. **Not killing**—Compassionate release of life.
2. **Not stealing**—Constantly practicing benevolent giving.
3. **Not lusting**—Chaste and cautious restraint.
4. **Not lying**—Advising and resolving anger with truth.
5. **Not slanderous speech**—Soft words and kind speech.
6. **Not false speech**—Speech must be truthful.
7. **Not frivolous speech**—Speech must convey truth.
8. **Not greed**—Cleanliness and aversion to filth.
9. **Not anger**—Compassionate heart toward all.
10. **Not wrong view**—Right understanding in the mind,
Also not stupidity—constantly practicing wisdom.

Yet within the realm of stupidity,
There are also arrogance and doubt:
Arrogance is contempt for others,
Doubt is hesitation.

The Ten Virtues encompass two aspects:
To cease the Ten Evils,
To practice the Ten Virtues.
Practice is encouragement—
Encouraging the cultivation of goodness.
Ceasing is precept—
Precepting the cessation of evil.

The essence of the Ten Virtues:
Since the Ten Evils are rooted in the three poisons—greed, anger, and stupidity—
The Ten Virtues should be rooted in the three virtues—modesty, compassion, and benevolence.

**The Four Offerings and Three Gifts**
The Four Offerings:
As the *Guan Shen Jing* (观身经) states:
*Wealth offering, body offering, life offering, and wisdom offering.*

1. **Wealth offering**—Gold, jade, and resources,
Offered with reverence and kindness.
2. **Body offering**—The body is the six senses and four elements;
Using one’s physical strength to rescue and inspire the living,
Encouraging the body to follow the Great Dao,
Also saving others from peril.
3. **Life offering**—Life is the unity of form and mind;
Exhausting one’s nature to guide others toward the Dao,
Also preserving their form and mind,
Preventing their severance—this is the offering of life.
4. **Wisdom offering**—Wisdom is cognition and insight;
Using wisdom to rescue the living,
Enlightening their understanding—this is the offering of wisdom.

Among the Four Offerings,
This offering is the most weighty.
In terms of merit,
As the scriptures say, it is inexhaustible.

The *He Tu Xia Pian* (河图下篇) states:
*"The five kinds of recipients for offerings:
1. Rescuing the poor and sick,
2. Creating sutras and texts,
3. Establishing halls of governance,
4. Building lecture halls,
5. Providing robes and alms for the body and law."*

Now summarizing offerings into two kinds:
1. Wealth offering,
2. Virtue offering.

The *Ben Jie Jing* states:
*"Constantly offering wealth and virtue,
Attracting and guiding sentient beings,
Using virtue to teach the ignorant,
Using wealth to aid the poor.
Yet wealth offerings are finite,
While virtue offerings are boundless."*

---
**The Eleventh Chapter: The Meaning of Cause and Effect**
The meaning is this:
Cause and effect demonstrate right and wrong,
Illuminating the distinctions between saints and mortals—
The principle of retribution is without difference,
The origins of suffering and joy are fixed.
If one can eliminate both afflictions,
One will surely converge upon the same path—
This is its essence.

**Explanation:**
Cause has five names: *cause, condition, action, karma, and root.*

**Cause**—that which initiates, also that which supports,
Summoning fruit for its function,
Close and able to generate.

**Condition**—that which aids karma in producing fruit,
Distant yet able to generate.

**Action**—that which traverses, also that which progresses toward deeds,
Action as cause in its essence,
Progressing toward fruit, its function named.

**Karma**—its meaning lies in action,
Its essence as name,
Also that which creates fruit through making,
Its function as designation.

**Root**—its meaning is in generation,
That which generates fruit,
Also named by its function.

**Fruit** has three names: *fruit, retribution, and response.*

Fruit is the name for repaying cause,
Retribution is the name for answering cause.

The essence of cause and effect has two meanings:
1. **The Outworldly Cause and Effect Essence**
   Cause is rooted in emptiness,
   This emptiness breaks through worldly illusions,
   Guiding all actions,
   As the basis for life’s understanding,
   Clarifying the Dao’s conditions.
   Fruit is rooted in all-knowing wisdom.
   If discussing cause and effect within the cause,
   Then initial understanding is the cause generating later understanding,
   Transforming and generating in succession,
   Reaching the Nine Saints.
   Great wisdom, when complete,
   Becomes the Dao’s fruit.
   This cause and effect is named *moral and transformative.*

2. **The Worldly Cause and Effect Essence**
   Good and evil causes,
   Suffering and joyful fruits.
   If conditions are rooted in form and mind,
   They obscure the true essence,
   Only the law of the mind remains.
   Hence the *Ling Bao Jing* (灵宝经) states:
   *"Good and evil retribution
   Stem solely from the mind."*

   It is also clarified in four phrases:
   *"One has a mental cause—
   The mind is the fruit, as in cause generating fruit.
   One has a form condition—
   Form is the fruit, as in planting peaches yielding peaches.
   One has a form condition—
   The mind is the fruit, as in dependent cause and dependent fruit.
   One has a mental condition—
   Form is the fruit, as in the Ten Virtues leading to heavenly birth."*

---

**Further, by categorizing the gates, it elucidates the essence of the fruits:**

The *Great Treatise* states that human and celestial realms are auspicious fruits, while the Three Disciples are punishments for transgressions.

Now, regarding the three realms’ joys and sorrows, there are two conventional interpretations:
1. The Three Realms are all suffering—though humans and celestial beings are called joyful, this is but illusory joy, not true bliss. It is said thus to encourage practitioners to cultivate virtuous roots for heavenly rebirth, for their emotions alone are deemed joyful.
2. It speaks of true enlightenment: the tranquil and contented are indeed endowed with such joy, yet their bodies are impermanent and bound by suffering. This is not ultimate truth. To awaken the deluded masses and guide them toward true understanding, it is taught that the deluded mind is suffering, while the enlightened mind is joy.

Thus, the *Settling the Will Sutra* (《定志经》) declares:
*"Desire is entirely illusion,
Illusion is utterly void.
Since it is void and illusory,
It is no true joy."*

Yet, it also expounds three stages:
1. The Three Disciples are suffering, while humans and celestial beings are joy—this is to urge them to abandon vice and embrace virtue, a teaching found across all scriptures.
2. Human and celestial realms are also suffering, while the True Saints alone are joy.
3. It further clarifies that even the True Saints are suffering.

Within the worldly realm, there exist suffering and joy, permanence and impermanence, purity#1 and impurity, freedom and bondage, life and death. If beings are aware of these, they are called *phenomena*; if unaware, they are termed *principles*—yet these are not the true principles of the Dao.

If joy, permanence, purity, and freedom arise within life and death, they are but phenomena without true principle, for these four do not exist in the realm of life and death. Only in the Dao’s domain are they fully realized.

Permanence is as the *Treasure of Primordial Mystery Sutra* (《宝玄经》) says:
*"The abiding Dao has neither origin nor precursor."*

Freedom is as the *Pact of Awe Sutra* (《盟威经》) states:
*"Serene and ever-present,
Hidden yet manifest, it moves freely."*

This freedom is also my teaching.
The *Contemplating the Body Sutra* (《观身经》) says:
*"Entering my formless realm,
One attains eternal bliss and peace."*

This reveals both my joy and the joy of the Dao.

The *Daoist Canon of Doctrinal Principles*, Volume Three, concludes here.

The **Twelfth Doctrine on the Five Shades (Yins)**:

The **Thirteenth Doctrine on the Six Emotions (Qings)**:

The **Fourteenth Doctrine on the Three Actions (Ye)**:

The **Fifteenth Doctrine on the Ten Evils (Wus)**:

---
**The Twelfth Doctrine on the Five Shades (Yins)**

The teaching states: The Five Shades arise from the Six Senses (*liùshí_六识), giving birth to the Four Minds (*sìxīn_四心). Once perception and reception begin, the true nature is obscured by illusion, shrouded as if extinguished. Only when the Way’s essence is illuminated does one awaken to its principles—this is their essence.

The *Sutra of Ascending to the Mysterious* (《升玄经》) says:
*"Having entered the realm of no entry,
Sense, perception, and mind are extinguished."*

Explanation: The Five Shades are *color* (色), *sense-perception* (识), *imagination* (想), *mind* (心), and *action* (行).

*Color* (色) refers to the obstruction of the Five Roots (*wǔgēn_五根).
*Sense-perception* (识) is the mind that clings to and constructs illusory forms.
*Imagination* (想) is the mind that fabricates and follows false connections.
*Mind* (心) is the faculty that accepts, discerns, and conforms to right and wrong.
*Action* (行) is the mind that, through generated causes, produces endless deliberation.

The first three minds—though seemingly distinct—are but a single delusion. The fourth mind alone can give rise to manifold delusions. Together, they form speech, and the distinctions among the Four Minds interpenetrate.

The initial mind’s perception is generated by causes—this is called *Action* (行). It may also be called *Mind* (心), for it accepts causes. It may also be called *Imagination* (想), for it is false perception. The remaining three follow similarly.

The term *Shade* (荫) is used because it covers and obscures. This reveals how the true nature is veiled, emotions unable to manifest or extinguish. The Five Shades thus fully shroud the Way’s reality. The Five Shades’ principle is rooted in *color* and *mind* as their substance, with the four minds being *mind* itself and the five roots their essence.

Through these Five Shades, the false self (*jiǎrén_假人) is assembled. The false self, enslaved by the Shades, becomes a vessel for emotional dust (*qíngchén_情尘).

The Daoist Master Xuanjing (玄靖法师) says:
*"All sensed beings share the same substance of spirit and *qi* (神气), hence the Five Paths differ, yet all bear the forms of spirit, sense, and *qi* (神识炁象)."*

The *Sutra of the Original Source* (《本际经》) says:
*"From the true parents, one is born and grows through cycles,
Taking form as body, dwelling in the womb—
Worldly parents, through whom one is nurtured,
Fulfilling all the roots, hence called *aggregation* (聚)."*

The Six Roots (*liùgēn_六根) are perfected by the Six Dusts (*liùchén_六尘), producing Sixfold Sense-Perception (*liùzhǒngshí_六种识)—this is called *Aggregation of Sense-Perception* (识聚).

Having falsely grasped the dusts and distinguished illusory forms—
*"This is male, this is female,
Mountains, forests, grasses, and trees,
Differentiated names and movements—*
All arise from the mind’s fabrication, hence called *Aggregation of Imagination* (想聚).

When false imagination generates attachment and aversion,
Distinguishing good and evil, beauty and ugliness,
Accepting them into the mind,
This is called *Aggregation of Mind* (心聚).

Having generated the mind and clung to it,
One produces greed, anger, and delusion
From what is seen,
All evil transgressions arise,
Creating karmic retribution—
Endless cycles of guilt and reward,
This is called *Aggregation of Action* (行聚).

The term *Aggregation* (聚) refers to the gradual coalescence of these illusions,
Shrouding all beings in darkness and suffering—
This is the essence of the Five Shades.

Again, the Five Shades arise from the Five Constants (*wǔcháng_五常),
Which are formed by the Four Great Elements (*sìdà_四大) and Six Families (*liùjiā_六家).

It is also said:
*"The Five Dusts generate the Four Great Elements,
The Four Great Elements generate the Five Roots."*

Now tracing their origin:
The roots arise from the dusts,
The dusts arise from the *qi* (炁).
Yet who generates the *qi* and dusts?

Seeking their fundamental source,
One finds none—
All is mere inversion.
What true substance remains?

Following conventional exposition:
All phenomena are generated from the Two *Qi*s (二炁),
Which form the Five Dusts,
Which construct the Five Constants,
And the Four Great Elements and Six Families arise from the Five Constants.
Hence the *Sutra of Dissolving the Demon* (《消魔经》) says:
*"The Four Great Elements are but temporary dwellings,
The Five Dusts but transient illusions."*

The *Sutra of Western Ascension* (《西升经》) says:
*"When the Four *Qi*s—earth, water, fire, and wind—converge,
They generate the Five Dusts.
If one does not take the dust of sound,
The remaining four dusts construct the Five Aggregates."*

Thus:
If gold and wood do not arise, then they do not.
If they arise, they produce the dust of sound.
Color is born from blue and yellow,
Taste from sweet and bitter.
Yet the Four Great Elements and Six Families
Are but conditional distinctions.

Hence within the Six Families,
The fire and wind of the Four Great Elements are contained,
And within the Four Great Elements,
The water and earth of the Five Dusts are also present.
All these doctrines
Are but the work of the Four Dusts.

Again, combining these doctrines,
One forms the false self—
The shade of *color* (色荫) merging with the Four Minds to create humanity.

The Four Dusts are:
*Color* (色), *scent* (香), *taste* (味), *tactile sensation* (触).
The Five Dusts are:
*Metal* (金), *wood* (木), *water* (水), *fire* (火), *earth* (土).

The Four Great Elements are:
*Earth* (地), *water* (水), *fire* (火), *wind* (风).

*Earth* (地) is the power that sustains and upholds,
*Water* (水) is the power that moistens and nourishes,
*Fire* (火) is the power that warms,
*Wind* (风) is the power that moves *qi* (气).
The Four *Qi*s (四气) are universal in their nature,
Hence they are called *Great* (大).
They are also the power that constructs phenomena—
*Small* (小) Families are:
First, *Jing* (甲寅) Wood, governing bones;
Second, *Jing* (甲辰) Wind, governing breath;
Third, *Jing* (甲午) Fire, governing warmth;
Fourth, *Jing* (甲申) Metal, governing teeth;
Fifth, *Jing* (甲戌) Earth, governing flesh;
Sixth, *Jing* (甲子) Water, governing blood.

All this is as the *Sutra of Mysterious Marvel* (《玄妙经》) elucidates.
Again, the substance of all phenomena
Relies on *emptiness* (空).

The seven orifices and five *zàng* (藏, *organs*), though relying on *emptiness* (空) for their substance,
and the *chū* (舟, *vessels*), *chē* (车, *vehicles*), houses, and dwellings, though using *wu* (无, *non-existence*) for their function,
are not formed by *emptiness* (空) itself.

Now, when *emptiness* (空) is explained as principle,
it cannot be divided into arising or ceasing—
how could it be said that *emptiness* (空) forms the substance of phenomena?

Now, if the five *gān* (根, *sense-bases*) and seven orifices have *emptiness* (空) within them,
is it that the *dharma* (法) relies on *emptiness* (空) for its function,
or does it take this *emptiness* (空) to construct the *dharma*’s substance?
If *emptiness* (空) were to form the substance of phenomena,
then once the substance of phenomena perishes,
*emptiness* (空) should also perish—
this would mean *emptiness* (空) has birth and death,
and thus it is not so.

Again, some say that all *dharma* (法) are impermanent,
and at the time of arising and ceasing,
they do not take this moment to form the substance of phenomena.
First, when *emptiness* (空) is explained as principle,
it merely transfers the substance of this phenomenon,
so that it does not abide—
thus, it does not form the substance,
and moreover, the two *qi* (气) construct the color.

Is arising and ceasing not the forming of the substance?
Now, since the meaning and intention differ,
one should not be troubled.
If it is said that the *qi* (气) coalesce to form the substance, it is appropriate;
if it is said that the *shí* (时, *moment*) coalesces to form the substance, it is not appropriate.

As for the discussion of whether it is formed or not formed,
all are merely for phenomena.
When considering the construction or non-construction,
how can it be definitively real?

Again, regarding the *shēng* (声, *sound*) of the substance,
when explaining that it is not the substance itself,
if it is said that a person without explanation or discourse would not be formed,
it is not that this meaning does not exist—
but rather, the arising and ceasing are not constant,
and thus it is not formed.

First, the substance of the *dharma* (法) is constructed,
then the *shēng* (声, *sound*) arises—
it is not that the *shēng* (声, *sound*) arises first,
and then the substance of the *dharma* (法) is formed.

**Six *qíng* (情, *affections*) and the Thirteenth Principle**
The principle states:
The six *qíng* (情, *affections*) correspond to the five *yìn* (荫, *shades/coverings*), and their meaning is derived from the four *wēi* (微, *subtle/transient states*).
Since they arise from the *jìng* (境, *objects/sense-fields) to generate the mind,
they also emerge from the *gān* (根, *sense-bases*) to manifest cognition.
As dust-clouds grow denser, the affections become obscured,
like the impurities of a polluted stream.
When the afflictions are dispelled, the mind returns to its original state of pure *qì* (炁, *subtle vital essence*).
This is their nature.

The *Sūtra of the Calm Mind* (《定志经》) says:
When the six *qíng* (情, *affections*) are contaminated,
they stir up the impurities of the mind.

The *Sūtra of Great Precepts* (《大戒经》) says:
When the six *qíng* (情, *affections*) are tranquil,
the spirit naturally returns.

**Explanation:**
The six *qíng* (情, *affections*) are:
*eye* (眼), *ear* (耳), *nose* (鼻), *tongue* (舌), *body* (身), and *mind* (心).
The *affections* (情) are also referred to as *six sense-faculties* (六识).

The *eye* perceives colors,
the *ear* hears sounds,
the *nose* smells fragrances,
the *tongue* tastes flavors,
the *body* feels tactile sensations—
this is the meaning of the *affections*.
The *mind* cognizes principles—
this is also the meaning of the *affections*.

The *body-affection* (身情) is also called *hand-affection* (手情).
The *hand* (手) is the essential means for the *body* (身) to act and function,
hence it is so named.

The *six affections* (六情) are also called *six cognitions* (六识).
This is because they are the *six affections* (情) of sentient beings,
distinct from inanimate objects like wood and stone.

Again, the meaning of *qíng* (情, *affections*) is *completion* (成).
When the six *qíng* (情, *affections*) are unrestrained,
evil and misfortune are completed.
When the six *qíng* (情, *affections*) are controlled,
fortune and goodness are also completed.
Since the meaning of *completion* (成) is the same,
they are called *affections* (情).

However, these six *shí* (识, *cognitions*) depend on the *sense-bases* (根) to arise.
They are named according to the *sense-bases* they rely upon,
hence the six *qíng* (情, *affections*) are also the six *shí* (识, *cognitions*) in substance.

Again, the meaning of the *six sense-bases* (六根) is:
The *sense-bases* (根) are named for their ability to generate cognitions.
Among the six *sense-bases* (根),
the five *sense-bases* (根) are of the *color* (色) category,
and the sixth *sense-base* (根) is the *mind* (心).

The five *sense-bases* (根) generate the five *shí* (识, *cognitions*),
hence they are called *sense-bases*.
The five *shí* (识, *cognitions*) are also called *mind sense-base* (心根),
as they generate the *xiǎng* (想, *reflections*) and *zhì* (志, *intentions*) within the *mind* (心),
hence they are called *sense-bases*.

Master Xu says:
The *dharma* of the six *sense-bases* (根) is all formed by the five *constants* (五常) and four *great* (大, *elements*).

If so, then Master Xu holds that the *heart-mind* (方寸) is the *mind sense-base* (心根).

Again, the five *zàng* (藏, *organs*) are considered the internal *sense-bases* (根).
Thus, the *Sūtra of the Ascending West* (《西升经》) says:
When the form and spirit are harmonized,
they mutually generate and complete each other.

Again, the meaning of the *six chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) is:
*color* (色), *sound* (声), *fragrance* (香), *flavor* (味), *tactile sensation* (触), and *principle* (理).

*Color* (色) refers to the five colors: blue, yellow, red, white, and black.
*Sound* (声) refers to the five tones: *shāng* (商), *zhì* (征), *gōng* (宫), *shǎng* (角), and *yuè* (羽).
*Fragrance* (香) refers to the five scents: *shān* (膻), *xīn* (辛), *suān* (酸), *kǔ* (苦), and *tián* (甘).
*Flavor* (味) refers to the five tastes: spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, and salty.
*Tactile sensation* (触) refers to the various sensations of cold, heat, and so forth.
*Principle* (理) refers to all *dharma* of phenomena.

The term *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) is generally used because these six objects can contaminate a practitioner,
just as fine dust can stain and soil.

One teacher says:
*Color* (色), *fragrance* (香), and *flavor* (味) each have their own *chén* (尘, *dust/objects*).
Within these three *chén* (尘, *dust/objects*), there is also *tactile chén* (触尘).
If these are not *flavor* (味), not *color* (色), not *fragrance* (香), etc.,
then they are distinct, yet their meaning is the same.
If they are distinct, they do not obstruct each other;
if they are the same, they all give rise to *body* (身) and *shí* (识, *cognition*).

As with the *ear* (耳) and *eye* (目) sense-bases,
they do not merely see and hear,
but also feel pain and itching.

One teacher says:
These four *dharma* (法) have no separate *chén* (尘, *dust/objects*).
Within one *chén* (尘, *dust/object*), all four are present,
though their substance is shared,
their meaning is distinct.

For instance, if one takes the entire body as *color* (色),
there is no part that is not *color*;
if one takes the entire body as *fragrance* (香),
there is no part that is not *fragrance*;
if one takes the entire body as *flavor* (味),
there is no part that is not *flavor*;
if one takes the entire body as *tactile sensation* (触),
there is no part that is not *tactile sensation*.

However, the meaning arises differently according to the *sense-base* that perceives them.
This teacher says:
If there are two *chén* (尘, *dust/objects*), then their meanings would obstruct each other.
But since they are distinct yet not obstructive,
it is appropriate.

Now, it is explained that only these four *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*)
are used to form all phenomena,
though they are spoken of in terms of affections.
Ultimately, they are all *emptiness* (空).

Why?
If *color* (色) and the rest are formed,
then which *dharma* (法) forms the *color* (色) and the rest?
If fine *color* (色) forms coarse *color* (色),
then what *dharma* (法) forms the fine *color* (色)?
If there is another *dharma* that forms them,
this would lead to an infinite regress;
if there is no *dharma* that forms them,
how could there be anything formed?
Thus, the *Sūtra of the Calm Mind* (《定志经》) says:
Within the three *āgāma* (三世),
the three *jiè* (界, *realms*) are all *emptiness* (空).
This is its meaning.

Again, the meaning of the *six rù* (入, *entrances*) is:
Master Xu says:
The *dharma* of the six *shí* (识, *cognitions*) can receive the six *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*).
The *dharma* of the six *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) can give rise to the six *shí* (识, *cognitions*).
Since they both arise and receive,
the two meanings interpenetrate.
When the external *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) enter the internal *shí* (识, *cognitions*),
this is called the *six rù* (入, *entrances*).

The *Sūtra of the Original Nature* (《本际经》) says:
When the six *sense-bases* (根) are complete,
they face the six *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*)
and generate the six kinds of *shí* (识, *cognitions*).

Now, the six *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) can also mutually enter each other.
Why?
When the *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) give rise to *shí* (识, *cognitions*),
it is the *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) entering the *shí* (识, *cognitions*).
When the *shí* (识, *cognitions*) arise in response to the *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*),
it is the *shí* (识, *cognitions*) entering the *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*).

However, the *dharma* of *shí* (识, *cognitions*) is internal,
and the *dharma* of *chén* (尘, *sense-objects*) is external.
When the external enters the internal,
the meaning is appropriate.

There are two kinds of *entrance* (入):
The first is *shì rù* (事入, *conventional entrance*);

「二者义入。 *义入* (conceptual entrance) refers to the recognition of *chén* (sense-objects) without the need for sensory contact.

*事入* (conventional entrance) occurs when *chén* (sense-objects) reach the *根* (sense-bases) and give rise to *shí* (cognitions). However, the *chén* (sense-objects) entering *shí* (cognitions) and the *shí* (cognitions) entering *chén* (sense-objects) are all inherently empty (*空*, *emptiness*). One should abandon attachment and not indulge in affection. Thus, the *本际经* (*Sutra of the Fundamental Boundary*) states: *"Although there is a body of mine, it should all be returned to emptiness."* (*空*, *emptiness*)

---

**第十四 义：三业**
The Fourteenth Principle: **The Three Karma/Acts (三业, *sānyè*)**
The Three Karma/Acts (三业, *sānyè*) are the foundation for the rise and fall of ascent and descent (*升沈*, *shēngshěn*), determining the consequences of virtue and vice (*罪福*, *zuìfú*). If one cultivates the Three Karma/Acts properly, one ascends to realms of bliss; if the six sense-bases (*六根*, *liùgēn*) are impure, one descends into sources of suffering. This is their essence.

The *本际经* (*Sutra of the Fundamental Boundary*) states:
*"First, one should cultivate the Three Virtuous Karma/Acts (三善行法, *sānshànxíngfǎ*). When the Three Karma/Acts are purified, the six sense-bases will also be purified."*

**Explication:**
1. **Body Karma (身业, *shēnyè*)**
2. **Speech Karma (口业, *kǒuyè*)**
3. **Mind Karma (心业, *xīnyè*)**

Greed, anger, and the other three poisons (*三毒*, *sāndú*) are primarily mental karma (*意业*, *yìyè*), though speech can also manifest them. However, speech karma is often subject to debate and not always definitive, hence it is said that body and speech karma arise from mental karma.

---

**第十五 义：十恶**
The Fifteenth Principle: **The Ten Evils (十恶, *shí'è*)**
The Ten Evils originate from the three poisons (*三毒*, *sāndú*), manifesting through the seven branches (*七支*, *qīzhī*). Greed and anger serve as their root, while killing and theft open their initial stages. When these branches are cultivated, the Ten Evils are consummated; when they are halted, they transform into virtuous roots. Desire seeks purity, and actions rely on their elimination. This is their essence.

The *本际经* (*Sutra of the Fundamental Boundary*) states:
*"From the three poisoned minds arise the ten evil karma."*

**Explication:**
The body has three evils: killing (*杀生*, *shāshēng*), stealing (*偷盗*, *tōudào*), and unchaste conduct (*邪淫*, *xiéyín*).
The speech has four evils: divisive speech (*两舌*, *liǎngshé*), harsh speech (*恶口*, *èkǒu*), lying (*妄言*, *wàngyán*), and frivolous speech (*绮语*, *qǐyǔ*).
The mind has three evils: greed (*贪欲*, *tānyù*), anger (*瞋恚*, *chēnhuì*), and wrong view (*邪见*, *xiéjiàn*), also known as ignorance and jealousy (*愚痴嫉妬*, *yūzhìjídì*).

Using these seven branches and three poisons, the ten evils are formed.

The *盟威经* (*Sutra of the Pledge of Power*) states:
*"To disrupt harmonious assemblies, to disorder respect for elders and inferiors, to speak harshly and curse, to scold heaven and earth without cause."*

**四缘义者**
The Principle of the Four Conditions (*四缘*, *sìyuán*):

For the seven branches of the body and speech, all four conditions must be present to consummate the karma. If even one condition is lacking, the karma does not manifest.

Which four? For example, even if three conditions are present, but the life of the victim is not severed, killing does not occur. If the victim is not a sentient being, killing does not occur. If one does not arise with the intention to kill, the karma of killing does not manifest. If there is no killing intention, the karma of killing cannot arise—only when one condition is missing does it fail to manifest. This explanation pertains to the seven branches of the Hinayana (*小乘*, *xiǎoshèng*).

If one discusses the Mahayana (*大乘*, *dàshèng*), even the presence of a killing intention alone constitutes a malevolent deed (*阴贼*, *yīnzéi*), hence one must be cautious.

The four conditions for killing are:
1. The victim is indeed a sentient being.
2. One arises with the thought of the victim as a sentient being.
3. One has the intention to kill.
4. One severs the victim’s life.

The four conditions for stealing are:
1. The object is indeed another’s property.
2. One arises with the thought of it as another’s property.
3. One has the intention to steal.
4. One takes it away from its rightful place.

The four conditions for unchaste conduct are:
1. The object is indeed an inappropriate realm.
2. One arises with the thought of it as an inappropriate realm.
3. One arouses the mind of unchaste conduct.
4. One’s body engages in defiled pleasure.

The four conditions for divisive speech are:
1. The person is indeed someone one has heard about.
2. One arises with the thought of the prior person.
3. One speaks disparaging words about them.
4. One arouses divisive thoughts and then speaks divisively to separate others.

The four conditions for harsh speech are:
1. The person is indeed someone one is scolding.
2. One arises with the thought of the prior person.
3. One arouses the mind of harsh scolding.
4. One speaks harshly and insultingly.

The four conditions for lying are:
1. The person is indeed someone one is deceiving.
2. One arises with the thought of the prior person.
3. One has the intention to deceive and lie.
4. One fabricates falsehoods and contradicts reality.

The four conditions for frivolous speech are:
1. The person is indeed someone one is speaking to.
2. One arises with the thought of this person.
3. One has the mind of frivolous speech.
4. One utters unrighteous words.

In all cases, the seven branches require the four conditions to manifest their deeds.

---

The seven evils arising from greed:
1. Greed for flavor leads to harming sentient beings.
2. Greed for wealth leads to stealing.
3. Greed for inappropriate realms leads to indulgence in lust.
4. Greed for fame and gain leads to fabricating lies.
5. Greed for close friends and loved ones leads to divisive speech.
6. Greed for others’ wealth leads to harsh scolding.
7. Greed for praise and reputation leads to speaking at the wrong time.

The seven evils arising from anger:
1. Anger toward someone leads to severing their life.
2. Anger toward someone leads to taking their wealth.
3. Anger toward someone leads to unchaste conduct with their spouse.
4. Anger toward someone leads to deceiving and lying about them.
5. Anger toward harmonious and united people leads to divisive speech.
6. Anger toward objects leads to harsh speech.
7. Anger toward someone leads to uttering unrighteous words.

The seven evils arising from ignorance:
1. Not understanding cause and effect leads to killing.
2. Not recognizing proper conduct leads to wrongful taking.
3. Up to and including ignorance leads to unrighteous actions.
4. Wrong views lead to perverse teachings, which in turn lead to peace.

Mind follows the path of reason and thus forms its nature; after seeing what is deviant, one generates erroneous views, and from these arise the seven evils. This principle is easily discerned.

**卷之五** concludes.
*(End of Volume Four of the Daoist Principles of the Way, corrected: "小" should read "六".)*
**卷之五** begins.
*(Volume Five of the Daoist Principles of the Way, compiled by the Qingxi Daoist Master Meng An.)*

**Chapter Sixteen: The Doctrine of the Three-in-One**
**Chapter Seventeen: The Doctrine of the Two Observations**
**Chapter Eighteen: The Doctrine of the Three Vehicles** *(Original text missing)*

**Chapter Sixteen: The Doctrine of the Three-in-One**
The meaning is this: The Three-in-One is the profound mystery of the Uncarved (Hixi), the pivotal mechanism of the receptive *qi* (Kunqi). When wisdom is applied, all affairs manifest in form; when united, all tendencies converge in the formless. This is its ultimate essence.

The *Tongshen Jing* [□] *Sanhuan Jue* states: "One is the *shen* (spirit), *jing* (essence), and *qi* (vital breath)."
Explanation: The three—*jing*, *shen*, and *qi*—when observed, are perceived as one.
*Jing* is the function of the empty, wondrous, and illuminating wisdom;
*Shen* is the application of boundless, unconstrained transcendence;
*Qi* is the principle governing form and manifestation.

It is also said: *Yi* (Uncarved), *Xi* (Far), *Wei* (Subtle)—*yi* is level, *xi* is distant, *wei* is refined.
*Yi* is *jing*, with its all-encompassing wisdom, equal and unbiased;
*Xi* is *shen*, with its inexhaustible application, distant from all defilements;
*Wei* is *qi*, with its subtle origin, transcending the coarse.

Master Meng’s teaching states: When speaking of "three" and "one," it is neither four nor two, for speaking of "one" itself constitutes the three.

The doctrine of the Three-in-One as a unified whole, as expounded by Master Xu, is the ultimate principle and the source of great wisdom—mysterious and boundless, spreading *qi* to nurture all without waste. It encompasses duality in meaning while being singular in essence. Now, when referring to the ultimate principle and great wisdom, these are names of contextualized wisdom; the source of enlightenment and the fulfillment of potential are distinctions of origin and trace, yet this remains undetermined.

Master Xuanjing’s explanation states: The origin of the wondrous One transcends all speech and form—neither substantial nor empty, yet both responding and quiescent.

Observing this interpretation, the round wisdom is the essence, neither origin nor trace, yet both origin and trace—neither substantial nor empty, yet both substantial and empty.

Moreover, the Three-in-One as a unified whole is not merely the circularity of *jing*, but also the circularity of *shen* and *qi*. How so?
The unboundedness of *jing* is *shen*;
The wondrous essence of *jing* is *qi*.
The illuminating wisdom of *shen* is the wondrous essence of *jing* and *qi*.
The illuminating wisdom of *qi* is the unboundedness of *jing* and *qi*, which is *shen*.
Since the Three-in-One is unified, they are all taken as the essence of *jing* and wisdom. Though the three meanings are unified, those who focus solely on *jing* have not yet attained mastery.

**The Doctrine of Cultivating and Guarding the Three-in-One**
The Three-in-One is cultivated through stillness and steadfastness.
The *Tongzhen Xiaomo Jing* states: "The wise guard the One, penetrating the source of the mind."
The *Laojun Jie Jing* states: "To preserve the One and guard the spirit, one must align with the transformation."
The mind is rectified through stillness; stillness of the body steadies the mind; a steadied mind quiets the perceptions; quieted perceptions unite with the Dao.

Now, the three doctrines are briefly revealed:
The first is expedient means;
The second is correct observation;
The third is transforming influences.
The first is like beating the drum to summon the assembly.
To practice correct observation, preventing harmful *qi* from intruding, one must gather and invoke the multitude of spirits for self-support.
The *Tongzhen Jing* states: "The left is the bell, the right is the chime, the center is the drum.
Sometimes thirty-six passages are used, corresponding to the thirty-six heavens;
Sometimes thirty-two passages are used, corresponding to the thirty-two heavens."

「Or twenty-seven passages, corresponding to the nine heavens—three times nine in number;
Or twenty-four passages, corresponding to the twenty-four deities of three eights;
Or twelve passages, corresponding to the twelve deities;
Or nine passages, corresponding to the nine palaces;
Or seven passages, corresponding to the seven elements;
Or three passages, corresponding to the three elements.
According to the number’s correspondence, one summons them accordingly.

The second is swallowing the saliva.
Saliva is the essence of the vital fluids, the source of the spring.
When the spring’s flow is unobstructed, it becomes the foundation for nurturing the body;
When the spring is clogged, it becomes the cause of disturbed thoughts.
Thus, one must swallow the saliva to irrigate the myriad spirits,
Only then can one maintain a tranquil mind to guard the Three-in-One.

The number’s correspondence is as with beating the drum.

The third is restraining the soul and controlling the spirit.
The soul is the yang spirit, its nature inclined toward life, favoring humanity with goodness.
The spirit is the yin spirit, its nature inclined toward death, favoring humanity with evil.
If one does not suppress evil and cultivate goodness, how can one enter the true and eliminate the false?
Thus, one must control the spirit and restrain the soul to truly guard the Three-in-One.

Correct observation is to correctly preserve the Three-in-One, as detailed in the original scripture.

Now, I elaborate on *transforming influences*—
From observing *qi*, one shifts into observing the spirit,
Transforming spiritual power to demonstrate the unimaginable,
Embodying the twofold observation’s reasoning.

**The Twofold Observation’s Reasoning (十七义):**
The twofold observation is the profound realm of concentration and insight,
The wondrous gateway of emptiness and form,
Used to regulate the mind, directly aspiring toward the supreme mystery,
Through which one dispels thoughts, ultimately reaching the shore of dual elimination.
Having attained truth from this path, one thereby understands the law—
This is its essence.

**Explanation:**
The twofold observation consists of:
1. Observing *qi*,
2. Observing the spirit.

Having introduced the two names—*qi* and spirit—
They encompass the dual meanings of body and mind.
The body has form and appearance, thus rightly named *qi* to clarify concentration;
The mind is boundless and unfathomable, thus rightly named spirit to clarify emptiness and insight.
Hence, the *Scripture of the Original Boundary* states:
*"Observing qi, observing spirit—this is concentration and insight."*

*Qi* refers to the manifestation of *qi*, meaning the wondrous *qi* of the preserved Three-in-One
Taking form and responding to the human body.

*Spirit* refers to the boundless and unfathomable, clarifying the two insights of emptiness and form,
Both being beyond conception, with myriad practices unfathomable in principle.

Generally, *observation* means contemplation—
Contemplating the wondrous One, perceiving the formless—this is called observation.

The scripture says:
*"To observe all dharmas with equanimity,
Neither grasping nor rejecting,
Neither moving nor dwelling,
Entering the single wondrous gateway—
This is called equality,
Also called equality without equality,
Equality where nothing is equal,
Virtue’s equality without unequal virtue."*

Again, the essence of observing *qi* lies in calming and stabilizing the body through observation.
Concentration has two meanings:
1. The preliminary observation,
2. The true entry.

Observing form is observing *qi*;
Observing the formless is observing the spirit.

It is also said:
*"Spirit observation is practiced beyond the realm,
Qi observation is cultivated within the realm."*

Now, I clarify the two observations of spirit and *qi*.
This division of concentration and insight is entrusted to body and mind,
To clarify emptiness and form.

Observing *qi* is concentration, also encompassing emptiness and form,
With wondrous form as its essence.

Observing the spirit is insight, also encompassing form and emptiness,
With true emptiness as its master.

If one regards emptiness and form as two insights,
Dividing concentration by law, this is merely one matter of the insight school,
Relying heavily on the principle of emptiness, hence distinguished as a separate observation.

Why?
All myriad practices enter the insight of form,
But if one observes emptiness, one enters the insight of emptiness.

One must also know that if, in the principles of concentration and insight,
One clearly understands the non-duality of body and mind,
There are five kinds of triple observations:

The first three observations:
1. Observing conventional dharma,
2. Observing true dharma,
3. Observing partial emptiness.

This clarifies that small-vehicle practitioners,
Not yet capable of profound enlightenment,
If not eliminated, cannot analyze emptiness.
Now, I present the elimination of true and conventional,
The elimination of conventional and emptiness,
The elimination of emptiness itself,
To make them generate a resolution of emptiness in these two realms.
Thus, the three are required.

Observing conventional dharma:
Conventional means provisional, dharma refers to the essence of dharma.
Now, I clarify observing the great essence—
Sentient beings empty of self, yet find it difficult to empty of objects,
As easy as the five shadows forming the self, yet they do not know which shadow is the self.

Hence, Zhuangzi says:
*"A hundred limbs, nine orifices, six viscera—
All are encompassed and preserved within me.
With whom, then, shall I claim kinship?"*

Since there is none to claim kinship,
By principle, the self is nonexistent.
Having realized the conventional dharma’s emptiness,
This is called observing conventional dharma.

Observing true dharma:
True refers to the essence of reality.
Having known that conventional dharma is empty,
One must further observe the true essence.
How?
This true essence—from whom does it arise?
It must arise from another,
But if it arises from another, this leads to infinite transference.
If not infinite, then it arises from emptiness.

If one says it arises from emptiness,
One must further examine this emptiness—
Emptiness itself is not self-sufficient,
How could it speak of generating?

Having realized that true dharma is also nonexistent,
This is called observing true dharma.

Observing partial emptiness:
Partial means incorrect, emptiness refers to the void’s universality.
Sentient beings are afflicted by many attachments to form,
Thus, emptiness is spoken of to eliminate this affliction.

The *Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious* states:
*"To abandon form, one must first attain the void,
To embody the void, one must attain the void of the void as supreme."*

Small-vehicle adherents, unable to reach the original heart,
Thus indulge in their minds, sinking into the realm of emptiness.
Hence, small-vehicle partial emptiness has not attained true observation.

Observing this emptiness—emptiness itself is empty.
The reason is:
It is originally empty of conventional and true dharma,
Thus it is said to be empty of conventional and true dharma.
If there is no emptiness, what remains to establish?
Thus, emptiness itself is empty.

The *Scripture of the Original Boundary* states:
*"This emptiness is also empty,
Empty emptiness is also empty."*

The second set of three observations:
1. Observing form,
2. Observing emptiness,
3. Observing the middle path.

Observing form:
Form refers to the obstruction of substance.
If one observes this language,
Form, if fixed as obstruction, should obstruct emptiness,
Yet since it does not obstruct emptiness,
How can obstruction be fixed?"

Hence, phenomena are neither obstructing nor non-obstructing unless considered as such.
If obstruction is taken as non-obstructing, and non-obstructing as obstructing,
Then since one knows non-obstructing to be obstructing,
One also knows that *non*-existence is existence.
Thus, in observation, one attains the gateway of **phenomena** (*dharma*).

If existence is not obstructing, and existence is indeed not obstructing,
Then how can observation not be complete?
Thus, this **phenomena** (*dharma*) is also taken as non-obstructing.

This **phenomena** (*dharma*) is profound and beyond reasoning—
How can it fully encompass the three meanings?
Because its **substance** (*tī*) is not real, hence it is **emptiness** (*kōng*).
Yet it is not devoid of conventional names, hence it is **existence** (*yǒu*).

If it is existence, then it is not emptiness;
If it is emptiness, then it is not existence.
This non-existence is the meaning of the **middle path** (*zhōngdào*).

Since the **phenomena** (*dharma*) is thus,
Observation is likewise.
It is originally named, hence called **existence** (*yǒu*) in observation.

In **non**-observation (*wú guān*),
There is no taking of non-obstructing as meaning.
If one observes this language,
**Non**-existence (*wú*), if taken as non-obstructing,
Should be like the absence of a bridge—
This should not apply.
Yet if it is indeed obstructing, how can it be fixed as non-obstructing?
Thus, one knows that **non**-phenomena (*wú fǎ*) are neither obstructing nor non-obstructing,
Taking non-obstructing as obstructing, and obstructing as non-obstructing.
Since one knows obstructing to be non-obstructing,
One also knows that **non**-non-existence is existence.
Thus, in observation, one still attains the gateway.

Observation having attained the gateway,
It encompasses the three meanings.
Which are:
If **non**-existence is not **non**-existence, its meaning is like existence;
Yet it is not **non**-non-existence, its meaning is like **non**-existence.
If like **non**-existence, hence it is **non**-existence;
If like existence, hence it is **non**-non-existence.
If like **non**-existence yet not **non**-existence,
If like existence yet not existence,
This is the meaning of the **middle path** (*zhōngdào*).

In the **middle path** (*zhōngdào*) observation,
It is precisely by observing this existence and **non**-existence,
And taking **non**-existence and **non**-non-existence as the **middle path** (*zhōngdào*) observation.

Since the observation of **phenomena** (*guān jìng*) is thus,
The observation of **substance** (*guān tǐ*) is likewise.

Taking the intent of the first three observations as not original,
They are not concerning existence and **non**-existence;
Since existence and **non**-existence are not original,
**Non**-non-existence is also **non**-non-existence.
The intent after the three observations,
Similarly attains this.

If one takes the **middle path** (*zhōngdào*) as a **partial** (*piān*) meaning,
Then existence and **non**-existence are **partial** (*piān*),
And **non**-existence and **non**-non-existence are the **middle path** (*zhōng*).
This would lean toward treating **non**-existence as existence and existence as **non**-existence.

「义曰：三界者，既摽色欲，明优劣之阶差，亦论因果，辩升沈之品次，
**Meaning of the Three Realms**: The Three Realms (*sānjiè*) are indeed beyond the defilements of form and desire (*sēngyù*), revealing the gradations of excellence and inferiority (*yōuliè zhī jiēchāi*), and also discuss the principles of cause and effect (*yīnlù*), distinguishing the ranks of ascent and descent (*shēngshěn zhī pǐncì*).

若超然出离，则遥诣道场，犹耽惑深，则永乖常乐，此其致也。
If one transcends and departs (*chāorán chūlí*) from them, one reaches the Dao-field (*dàocháng*) afar. Yet if one remains deeply entangled in defilements (*dānwù*), one forever strays from the eternal bliss (*chánglè*) of the common path (*chánglè*), such is their essence (*zhì*).

释曰：一欲界者，以染欲为义，内心欲重，从以为名。
**Explanation**: The first, the Realm of Desire (*yùjiè*), is defined by its defiled desires (*ránwù*). Its name derives from the heavy burden of desire within the inner heart (*nèixīn yùzhòng*).

二色界者，以质碍为义，外色显着，从以为名。
The second, the Realm of Form (*sèjiè*), is defined by its material obstructions (*zhìài*). Its name comes from the manifesting of external forms (*wàisè xiǎnzhuó*).

三无色界者，无下界色，从无为名也。
The third, the Realm of Non-Form (*wúsèjiè*), is named thus for its lack of lower-realm forms (*wú xiàjiè sè*).

通名界者，以墟域为义，谓各有虚域也；
In general, the term "Realm" (*jiè*) signifies a void expanse (*xūyù*), for each has its own domain of emptiness (*xūyù*).

亦以界别为义，谓业果各殊也；
It also denotes the distinction between realms (*jièbié*), for the fruits of karma (*yèguǒ*) differ in each.

亦名为有，谓有众生也。
And it is called "having" (*yǒu*), for it contains sentient beings (*zhòngshēng*).

按《灵宝本元经》: 三十二天以上之四天为种民，二十八天分为三界，
According to the *Lingbao Benzhuan Jing* (Scripture of the Soul-Treasury on the Origin of the Three Realms): The four heavens above the thirty-two heavens (*sǎnmíntiān*) are the seed-citizens (*zhòngmín*), and the twenty-eight heavens are divided into the Three Realms. The first six heavens are the Realm of Desire, the next eighteen are the Realm of Form, and the remaining four are the Realm of Non-Form.

前六天为欲界，次十八天为色界，后有四天为无色界也。
The first six heavens are the Realm of Desire, the following eighteen are the Realm of Form, and the last four are the Realm of Non-Form.

所以置三界者，然可见知法不出三者：
Thus, the Three Realms are established, for it is evident that the Dharma (*Fǎ*) does not transcend these three:

一者豁尔虚空，二者质碍形色，三者缘虑心体。
The first is the vast void (*huelì xūkōng*), the second is the obstruction of material forms (*zhìài xíngsè*), and the third is the mental entanglements of sentient beings (*yuánlǜ xīntǐ*).

就此三法，故成三界。
Hence, these three principles (*sāfǎ*) constitute the Three Realms.

又为三界凡四种者：
Moreover, the Three Realms encompass four categories (*sìzhǒng*):

一者应化三界，此则无所不在，或在一天之内，各各皆有，或在一尘之内，亦复皆有，
The first is the **manifested** (*yìnghuà*) Three Realms, which pervade all existence (*wúsuǒbùzài*). Within a single heaven (*yītiān*), each of the Three Realms is present, and even within a single dust-mote (*yīchén*), they are likewise all contained.

变化通方，不可定也，以三十二天是应住境化也。
They transform and spread throughout the ten directions (*biànhuà tōngfāng*), yet their nature cannot be fixed—this is the **manifestation** (*yìngzhù jìnghuà*) within the thirty-two heavens.

二者轮回於三界，漂浪而忘反，流转於五通，长沦而弗悟是也，
The second is the **revolving** (*lúnhuí*) within the Three Realms, drifting like a boat without recall (*piāowàng ér wàngfǎn*), transmigrating through the Five Paths (*liúzhuǎn yú wǔtōng*), endlessly lost without awakening (*chánglún ér fúwù*).

此论报得也。
This pertains to the attainment of retribution (*bàodé*).

三者流来三界，谓从氤氲之气起，三界通执，渐惭流来，
The third is the **flowing into** (*liúlái*) the Three Realms, meaning that from the primordial *qi* (*yīnyūn zhī qì*), the Three Realms are collectively grasped (*tōngzhí*), and through gradual shame (*jiàn*), one flows into them.

形染六情之时，四心五根始具。
When one’s form is stained by the Six Emotions (*liùqíng*), the Four Minds (*sìxīn*) and Five Roots (*wǔgēn*) begin to manifest.

但初来之时，实未於三界，由返出之时，还用此中染累，
Yet at the initial moment of arrival (*chūlái zhī shí*), one is truly not yet within the Three Realms. When one departs and returns (*fǎnchū*), one still employs the defilements (*ránlěi*) of this realm.

得此中报，故分为三界也。
Thus, one receives the corresponding retribution (*bàodé*), which is why the Three Realms are distinguished.

四者返出三界者，经云：复我清虚，反我两半，此论修得永断也。
The fourth is the **departure from** (*fǎnchū*) the Three Realms, as the scripture states: "Restore my clarity and emptiness (*qīngxū*), return my duality to its origin (*liǎngbàn*)"—this refers to the attainment of eternal severance (*yǒngduàn*) through cultivation (*xiūdé*).

若论#1回三界，乃论报得。
If one speaks of the **#1** (*yī*) return to the Three Realms, it is about the attainment of retribution.

然就报得往论，
However, in discussing the attainment of retribution (*bàodé*),

一纯恶业，得三从报。
The first is those with **purely malevolent karma** (*chún'è yè*), who receive the Three Follower Retributions (*sāncóng bào*).

二善恶杂业，得人中报。
The second are those with **mixed good and evil karma** (*jiāyè zábù*), who receive the human retribution (*rénzhōng bào*).

三纯善业，得十八天报，此十八天犹有动坏。
The third are those with **purely virtuous karma** (*chúnshàn yè*), who attain the retribution of the eighteen heavens (*shíbā tiān bào*), though these eighteen heavens still possess the potential for disturbance (*dònghuài*).

四者不动业，得十九天以上至三十二天报也。
The fourth are those with **immovable karma** (*bùdòng yè*), who attain the retribution of the nineteen heavens and above, up to the thirty-two heavens.

作若有若无，观则生第四天，
If one cultivates with the **as-if-having-as-if-non-having** (*ruòyǒu ruòwú*) perspective, one is reborn in the Fourth Heaven (*dìsì tiān*),

於此天中，气观转妙，增修四等，稍除余习，
Within this heaven, the **subtle transformation of *qi* and perception** (*qìguān zhuǎnmiào*) occurs. By further cultivating the Four Stages (*sìděng*), one gradually eliminates residual defilements (*yúxí*).

生四民天，洞入道境，随气升除，灾所不及也。
One is born in the Four Noble Heavens (*sìmín tiān*), penetrating the Dao-field (*dàocháng*), ascending and transcending (*shēngchú*) with the *qi*, beyond the reach of calamities (*zāi*).

五道义第二十四
**Meaning of the Five Paths, the Twenty-Fourth**

义曰：五道者，明善恶之杂报，示苦乐之差别，
**Meaning**: The Five Paths (*wǔdào*) reveal the retributions of mixed virtue and vice (*shàn'è zhábào*), illustrating the distinctions between suffering and joy (*kǔlè chābié*).

戒行是修，则受人天之果，
Through observance of precepts (*jièxíng*) and cultivation (*shìxiū*), one receives the fruits of human and heavenly realms (*rén tiān zhī guǒ*).

罪缘不辍，仍为地狱之因，此其致也。
If the causes of sin (*zuìyuán*) are not severed, they remain as the roots of hellish retribution (*dìyù zhī yīn*), such is their essence.

一天道，二人道，三地狱道，四畜生道，五饿鬼道。
The first is the Heavenly Path (*tiāndào*), the second is the Human Path (*réndào*), the third is the Path of Hell (*dìyùdào*), the fourth is the Path of Beasts (*chùshēngdào*), and the fifth is the Path of Hungry Ghosts (*èguǐdào*).

释曰：一天道者，字一大也。
**Explanation**: The Heavenly Path (*tiāndào*) is also called the Great One (*yīdà*).

道气初应之曰一，一统亿兆，无所不包，故号一大。
The primordial Dao-*qi* (*dàoqì*) initially responds as the One (*yī*), which governs myriad beings (*yìzhào*), encompassing all without exception (*wúsuǒbùbāo*), hence its name, the Great One.

天以自然为义，言诸天皆果报自然也。
Heaven (*tiān*) signifies **naturalness** (*zìrán*), for all heavens are the natural retributions (*guǒbào*) of one’s karma.

二人道者，人者，仁人也，谓有仁爱；
The Human Path (*réndào*) refers to the **compassionate beings** (*rénrén*), for they possess benevolence and love (*rénài*).

亦以统御为义，谓假人御阴阳也。
It also denotes **governance** (*tǒngyù*), for humans regulate the interplay of yin and yang (*yīnyáng*).

三地狱道者，谓居在地下囚狱之中也。
The Path of Hell (*dìyùdào*) refers to those imprisoned within subterranean hells (*dìxià qiúyù*).

四畜生道者，谓为人所畜，亦是积恶招生也。
The Path of Beasts (*chùshēngdào*) refers to those who are domesticated by humans (*wéirén suǒchù*), or who are reborn due to accumulated malevolence (*jī'è zhāoshēng*).

五饿鬼道者，鬼，归也，谓去生归灭，无粮常饿也。
The Path of Hungry Ghosts (*èguǐdào*) refers to the **departed** (*guǐ*, *guī*), for they leave life and return to annihilation (*qùshēng guīmiè*), perpetually starving without sustenance (*wúlìang cháng'è*).

亦有六道，即加鬼神道。
There are also Six Paths (*liùdào*), which include the Path of Ghosts and Spirits (*guǐshén*).

又五道义例，自天道即三界四民等天，随其果报轻重而生。
Moreover, the Five Paths’ principles (*wǔdào yìlì*) begin with the Heavenly Path, which encompasses the Four Noble Heavens (*sìmín*) and other heavens within the Three Realms (*sānjiè*), arising according to the weight of one’s retribution (*guǒbào*).

诸天人道义者，圆首法天，足方象地，心怀二爱，谓之为人。
The principles of the Heavenly and Human Paths (*zhūtīan réndào yì*) are that the **Heaven of the Law** (*Fǎtiān*) has a circular head (*yuánshǒu*), square feet (*fāngzú*) symbolizing Earth (*dì*), and a heart harboring the dual loves (*èrài*), thus called human.

地狱道者，按经有二种：
The Path of Hell (*dìyùdào*) has, according to scripture, two varieties (*èrzhǒng*):

一者北酆地狱。
The first is the **Northern Torment Hell** (*Běifúng dìyù*).

二者五岳地狱，泰山二十四狱，霍山，西狱，恒山，嵩高，此四狱。
The second is the **Five-Peak Hells** (*wǔyuè dìyù*), including the Twenty-Four Hells of Mount Tai (*Tàishān èrshísì yù*), Mount Huo (*Hèoshān*), the Western Hell (*Xīyù*), Mount Heng (*Héngshān*), and Mount Song (*Sōnggāo*), which are four in total.

《正一经》云：天一地狱，皇天九平狱，青诏狱，有二十四大地狱，
The *Zhèngyī Jing* (Scripture of the Upright One) states: "The One Heaven and the One Hell, the Nine Level Hells of the Imperial Heaven (*Huángtiān jiǔpíngyù*), and the Green Edict Hell (*Qīngzhāoyù*), contain the Twenty-Four Great Hells (*èrshísì dà dìyù*),"

此并罪业不同，或有殊异。
These differ in terms of sins and retributions (*zuìyè*), sometimes with distinct variations (*shūyì*).

又五道果报义者，五戒生人，十戒生天。
Moreover, the retributions of the Five Paths (*wǔdào guǒbào*) are as follows: the observance of the Five Precepts (*wǔjiè*) yields rebirth as a human, and the Ten Precepts (*shíjiè*) yield rebirth as a heavenly being.

又善有二品，重者生天，轻者生人也。
There are also two grades (*èr pǐn*) of virtue: the heavier (*zhòng*) yields rebirth as a heavenly being, while the lighter (*qīng*) yields rebirth as a human.

混元义第二十五
**Meaning of the Primordial Mystery, the Twenty-Fifth**

义曰：三炁不分，凝积为天地之始，
**Meaning**: When the Three *Qi* (*sānhuì*) are not yet differentiated (*bùfèn*), they coalesce and accumulate (*níngjī*) to form the origin (*shǐ*) of Heaven and Earth (*tiāndì*).

万物初混，阴阳成品汇之先，
All things are initially in a state of chaos (*chūhùn*), before the formation of yin and yang (*yīnyáng*) and their gathering into the Five Phases (*wǔcháng*).

然则理运将开，所以妙物垂应，
Thus, as the **principle of transformation** (*lǐyùn*) is about to unfold (*jiāngkāi*), wondrous phenomena (*miàowù*) begin to respond (*chuíyìng*).

元和既贷，清浊遂分五常，
Once the **Primordial Harmony** (*Yuánhé*) is established (*jìdài*), the clear and turbid (*qīngzhuó*) naturally separate into the Five Phases (*wǔcháng*).

於是得宜三界，由之合度，此其致也。
Hence, the Three Realms (*sānjiè*) are formed in accordance (*déyì*), and through this, the **harmonious measure** (*héduó*) is achieved—such is their essence.

释曰：天地混元义者，混元之时，三炁混沌，
**Explanation

Form takes substance (*xíngbiàn yǒuzhì*), and is named **Great Substance** (*Tàisù*), also called **Great Void** (*Tàikōng*), its *qi* white, its form yet unmanifest.
When form and substance are fully realized (*xíngzhì yǐjù*), it is named **Great Polarity** (*Tàijí*), also called **Great Existence** (*Tàiyǒu*), **Great Spirit** (*Tàishén*), **Great *Qi*** (*Tàiqì*), **Great Mysterious** (*Tàixuán*), **Great Supreme** (*Tàishàng*), or **Great One** (*Tàiyī*). Its form is red-yellow, its substance settled as white and pure—yet before their separation, it is called **Chaos** (*hùn*).

When undifferentiated and unrefined, it is **Stupor** (*dùn*); when the first principle of all things, it is **Primordial** (*yuán*).
Thus, the **Two Halves** (*liǎngbàn*), the **Three Talents** (*sāncái*), the **Five Phases** (*wǔcháng*), and all phenomena remain indistinct—this is called **Primordial Chaos** (*hùnyuán*).

When form and image begin to differentiate, illumination unfolds (*míng zhī kāipì*), and when the eon (*jié*) exhausts its course, it returns to destruction, dissolving back into **Stupor**.

The **Wind and Dew of the Cavernous Void** (*fēngzé dòngxū*)—seeming like wind yet not wind, like water yet not water—its nature is obscured (*xìnghūn*), beyond distinction.

It was said: Within **Primordial Chaos**, there are **coarse** and **refined** aspects.
The refined is the **Dao-*qi*** (*dàoqì*), singular in unity.
The coarse is the multitude of phenomena (*pǐnwù*).

Now it is clarified: The Dao is nowhere absent, its meaning profound and mysterious.
Yet **Chaos** and **Distinction** (*hùn-zì*) inherently differ—neither purely internal nor external, neither non-internal nor non-external, capable of both, simultaneously internal and external.
Thus, the **one** and the **many**, the **coarse** and the **refined**—their meaning is self-evident.

Divided broadly, there are **twelve kinds**, of which **two** are *qi*, and **ten** are things.
The two *qi* are **yin and yang**; the ten things are the **five sentient** and **five insentient**.
The five sentient are: humans, gods, spirits, beasts, and insects.
The five insentient are: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

**Explanation of Heaven and Earth**:
Heaven and Earth are **encompassing** (*tǒng*), meaning they govern and nurture all things as their function.
They are also **first** (*xiān*), for their function begins with differentiation—clear *qi* first ascends.
They are also **inverted** (*diān*), for the high protects the low.

The **Mysterious Void** (*Xuánxū*) above is Heaven, endowed with the **Seven Luminaries** (*qīyào*) to manifest its form. Heaven’s clear *qi* establishes its foundation.

As the **Scriptures of the Birth of the Spirit** state: **"Accumulated yang forms Heaven."**
Yet, in ultimate analysis, is there truly such a Heaven?
Thus, the **Sage’s transformation** governs all, declaring it *qi*—though not having it, it is also not without it, neither having nor not having, yet having while not having.

The *Tàizhēn Kē* states:
The **Three Heavens** above are supreme, named **Great Luo** (*Dàluó*), the ultimate realm of the Dao.

The **refined *qi*** is singular, and from here, **Great Luo** generates the **Primordial Three *Qi*** (*Xuányuánshǐ sānqì*), which transform into the **Three Pure Ones’ Heavens**:
1. **Pure Microcosmic Heaven** (*Qīngwēi Tiān*), the realm of **Upper Clarity** (*Yùqīng*), formed by the **initial *qi***.
2. **Yu Remnant Heaven** (*Yǔyú Tiān*), the realm of **Upper Clarity** (*Shàngqīng*), formed by the **Primordial *qi***.
3. **Great Vermilion Heaven** (*Dàchì Tiān*), the realm of **Supreme Clarity** (*Tàiqīng*), formed by the **Mysterious *qi***.

From these three *qi*, each generates three *qi*, totaling **nine *qi***, forming the **Nine Heavens**—their names recorded in the *Dòngzhēn Jīng*.
Each of the Nine Heavens generates three heavens, making **twenty-seven heavens**; combined with the original nine, they total **thirty-six heavens**, their names found in the *Wàiguó Fàngpǐn Jīng*.

The numbers of Heaven and Earth are **infinite**—eight directions, each with **five hundred fifty-five million, five hundred fifty-five thousand, five hundred fifty-five** layers.
The numbers of Heaven and Earth are also like today’s four directions, their heavens existing within the **void of emptiness**, encircling the eight cardinal points.

Yet the heavens are numerous—some layered beneath, some stacked beside, some aligned with Earth—beyond enumeration.

From the *Cángtiān Jīng* also emerge the **four heavens**:
- **East: Dài**,
- **South: Fúlí**,
- **West: Yēní**,
- **North: Chányuè**.

**Explanation of the Sun, Moon, and Stars**:
The **Sun** (*rì*) is **substance** (*shí*), for its body is unwaning, hence named **Substance**.
The *Sāndào Shùnxíng Jīng* states: **"Yang essence is the Sun."**
The *Lǎojūn Zhōng Jīng* states: **"The Sun and Moon are Heaven’s Grand Ministers and Grand Stewards."**
The *Yùpèi Jīnshuāng Jīng* states: **"The Sun is Heaven’s Soul."**
The *Cángtiān Jīng* states: The Sun’s breadth is **2,400 *lǐ***, its inner radiance composed of **water-precision**, its outer light diffused. Within are cities, people, and **seven-treasured pools**, where four kinds of **blue, red, yellow, and white lotuses** bloom. The people are **24 *chǐ*** tall, clad in crimson, their flourishing and decline mirroring the four seasons—thus the **four seasons** arise.

The Sun’s movement is governed by **five winds**:
1. **Temporal Wind** (*shífēng*),
2. **Vigorous Wind** (*jìngfēng*),
3. **Assisting Wind** (*zhùfēng*),
4. **Turning Wind** (*zhuǎnfēng*),
5. **Traveling Wind** (*xíngfēng*).

Thus, they **command the Sun, Moon, and stars**, revolving through the void—nothing rests, all propelled by wind as sails.
The **pivotal** Sun and Moon, their waxing and waning, are the **four seasons’ gatherings**, their **concealment and emergence** like **headgear and sashes**.

According to the *Hétú*, Heaven has **365 degrees**; the Sun traverses one degree daily, completing a full circuit in a year. Its waxing and waning are detailed elsewhere.

The **Moon** (*yuè*) is **deficiency** (*quē*), for it has waning phases.
The *Sāndào Shùnxíng Jīng* states: **"Yin essence is the Moon,"** thus its body is yin essence.
The *Yùpèi Jīnshuāng Jīng* states: **"The Moon is Heaven’s Corpse."**
The *Cángtiān Jīng* states: Its breadth is **1,900 *lǐ***, its halo spanning **7,840 *lǐ***, its interior lined with **white silver, red agate, and water-precision**. Within are cities, people, and **seven-treasured baths**.
The Moon has **eight *xiàn*** forests, where its people—**16 *chǐ*** tall—wear **green robes**. The **five winds** also govern its movement.

The **Stars** (*xīng*) are **completion** (*chéng*), for they complete and regulate the **four seasons and Five Phases**; they are also called **lodgings** (*sù*), where the Sun and Moon **converge and rest**.
They are also tied to **human destinies**.

The *Cíyī Wǔlǎo Jīng* states: **"The Five Stars are the essences of the Five Phases,"** thus their bodies are the Five Phases’ essences.
The *Cángtiān Jīng* states: The **Northern Dipper’s nine stars** are each **90,000 *lǐ*** apart, **400,000 *lǐ*** from Earth, with a circumference of **720 *lǐ***. Their walls are of **golden precision and agate**, their light radiant with **jade and purple hues**. Within lies the **lodging of celestial beings and true ones**.

Each day and night, it revolves through the **Celestial Pole** (*Zhòutiān*) by one degree, and within it grow **treasures of pearls, gems, and trees**.

Furthermore, regarding **Earth** (*Dì*): *Dì* means "to bear" and "to hold," triumphantly sustaining all things, nurturing and bearing life, and giving rise to all plants.
The old texts say: Earth has **three mountains and rivers**.

The *Tàipíng Jīng* states: **Earthly geography** (*Dìlǐ*) refers to the **three essences**—water, soil, and stone.

Now, according to the *Shēngshén* and related scriptures, it is said: **"Accumulated stagnation forms Earth,"** thus knowing that Earth is formed by **Yin-qi**.

According to the *Fàngpǐn Dòngyuān Jiǔdì Sānshíliùyīn Nèimíng*:
- The **First Layer**, **Rùnse** Earth, is **99 billion *lǐ*** distant from Heaven.
- The **Second Layer**, **Gāngse** Earth, is **81 billion *lǐ*** from the First Layer.
- The **Third Layer**, **Shízǐse** Earth, is **120 billion *lǐ*** from the Second Layer.
- The **Fourth Layer**, **Rùnzé** Earth, is **20 billion *lǐ*** from the Third Layer.
- The **Fifth Layer**, **Jīnlì** Earth, is **20 billion *lǐ*** from the Fourth Layer.
- The **Sixth Layer**, **Jīngāng Tiězé** Earth, is **20 billion *lǐ*** from the Fifth Layer.
- The **Seventh Layer**, **Mùzhì** Earth, is **20 billion *lǐ*** from the Sixth Layer.
- The **Eighth Layer**, **Dàfēngzé** Earth, is **80 billion *lǐ*** from the Seventh Layer.

The above **eight layers of Earth** all extend downward, encircling the **four cardinal directions**, boundless and infinite, without form or *qi*.

The **Ninth Layer**, **Dòngyuān Wúse Gāngwéi** Earth, is the deepest abyss of the nine layers, the **foundational threads** (*gāngwéi*) of Heaven and Earth, restraining and preventing collapse, **520 billion *lǐ*** distant from the First Layer.

The **nine layers of Earth**, descending ninefold, each governed by **four soil sovereigns** (*sì tǔhuáng*), totaling **thirty-six sovereigns**, corresponding above to the **thirty-six heavens**. Thus, these **upper sovereigns** all share the title of **Yùhuáng** (*Jade Sovereign*), differing only in their *qi* and governance, with distinctions of rank above and below.

Moreover, beneath **Kūnlún Mountain**, there are **nine layers of Earth**, each layer of Earth containing a **layer of water**, and each layer of water containing a **layer of wind**. Thus, the layers of **wind and water** each have ninefold depths, mutually supporting one another.

Now, when the **Earth moves** (*Dìdòng*), it is the **shaking of wind and water**.

*From the Daoist teachings in **Yìgǔ Juàn** (卷) *Seven* and *Eight* by **Qīngxī Dàoshì Mèng Ānpái**.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: *Lǐjiào* (The Doctrine of Principle)**
**Chapter Twenty-Seven: *Jìngzhì* (The Wisdom of Realms)**
**Chapter Twenty-Eight: *Zìrán* (The Doctrine of Nature)**

---

**Chapter Twenty-Six: *Lǐjiào* (The Doctrine of Principle)**
The meaning is this: *Lǐjiào* (The Doctrine of Principle) clarifies that *jiào* (teaching) is indeed a teaching, demonstrating that which is beyond words—those who forget the *qiàn* (stems, roots) enter its void source, and those who attain harmony return to its subtle intent. This is its essence.

The *Dàodéjīng* states: *"The teaching that cannot be spoken of is the perfect teaching."*

Explanation: *Lǐ* (Principle) refers to the intent and purpose, while *jiào* (teaching) refers to guidance and transformation. Again, *lǐ* is the Four Forgets, and *jiào* is discourse and reasoning.

Now, it is made clear that the Four Forgets are not separate from spoken teachings—rather, the realization that spoken teachings are beyond words *is* the Four Forgets. If one comprehends that spoken teachings are beyond words, one also recognizes that the Four Forgets are not the Four Forgets.

Now, the *Lǐjiào* (Doctrine of Principle) is demonstrated in two broad forms: one of expedient means, and one of ultimate realization.

Opening the gate of expedient means allows one to attain awakening. The expedient *Lǐjiào* (Doctrine of Principle) is like the precepts elucidating preceptual principles, or giving elucidating giving’s principles.

The ultimate *Lǐjiào* (Doctrine of Principle) encompasses the Six Perfections and the seven divisions of scriptures, treating teachings as *dharma*. It is the realization that precepts are not precepts, texts are not texts—words and letters are empty in their essence. Abandoning spoken teachings, one attains the Principle beyond words.

Now, it is made clear that realizing spoken teachings *are* beyond words is not to seek a Principle separate from words, but rather the Principle itself. The *ShēngXuánjīng* states: *"The Dao of the Immortal is neither non-being nor being—this is its meaning."*

Again, the *Lǐjiào* (Doctrine of Principle) in terms of gradual and sudden realization adapts to the student’s capacity, comprising five categories:

1. **Gradual and Sudden** – From shallow to deep is gradual; complete exposition at once is sudden. For instance, first revealing the *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity), then proceeding to *Tàipíng* (Supreme Peace)—this is gradual teaching. Or, as in the case of *Yín Shēng* (Emperor Yin), who immediately expounded on *dàodé* (Dao/virtue)—this is sudden teaching. The dull require gradual instruction; the sharp require sudden.

2. **Detailed and Concise** – Elaborate exposition is detailed; brief, essential paths are concise. Concise, as in the *Bāzì* (Eight Trigrams) teachings; detailed, as in the seven divisions of scriptures.

3. **Shallow and Deep** – Discussing ultimate principles is deep; speaking of proximate matters is shallow. Shallow, as in elixir talismans and minor techniques; deep, as in the empty, mysterious Dao.

4. **Conventional and Expedient** – Adhering to established principles is conventional; reversing norms to align with the Dao is expedient. This also depends on the student’s capacity—easy cases are taught conventionally, difficult ones transformed through expedient means.

5. **Abandonment and Revival** – Eliminating erroneous methods is abandonment; elevating true teachings is revival. Revival, as in the Three Heavens flourishing in the Han Dynasty; abandonment, as in the Six Heavens fading in the Zhou era.

---

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: *Jìngzhì* (The Wisdom of Realms)**
The meaning is this: *Jìngzhì* (The Wisdom of Realms) is the profound name for adhering to teachings, the distinct designation of mind and principle. Realms are defined by two aspects of the Two Forgets; wisdom illuminates with threefold speech, returning to the Four Absolutes—this is its essence.

Wisdom is the source marking the flow, knowing the return without doubt.

Explanation: *Jìng* (Realm) refers to the boundary of phenomena; *zhì* (Wisdom) refers to decisive realization. Illumination is wisdom; insight into emptiness is wisdom.

Again, in terms of the essence of *jìngzhì* (Realm-Wisdom), *jìng* (Realm) is the stubborn *dharma*, and *zhì* (Wisdom) is the Four Absolutes. Knowing the Four Forgets, one attains the true Realm.

Now, it is made clear that *zhì* (Wisdom) is *jìngzhì* (Realm-Wisdom)—one cannot fixedly define *jìng* (Realm) as *zhì* (Wisdom) or *zhì* (Wisdom) as *jìng* (Realm). If *jìng* (Realm) is defined as *jìng* (Realm) and *zhì* (Wisdom) as *zhì* (Wisdom), neither the true Realm nor the true Wisdom is attained. If one knows that which is not *zhì* (Wisdom) is *zhì* (Wisdom), and that which is not *jìng* (Realm) is *jìng* (Realm), then neither the true Wisdom is in the Realm, nor is it known through the ignorance of knowing—knowing nothing, yet knowing all. Thus, one comprehends everything.

Then, the Realm that is not a Realm has its meaning outside, and the Wisdom that is not Wisdom resides within. Within lies all-encompassing wisdom-mind; without lies all-encompassing *dharma* of realms. Non-dual within and without, Realm and Wisdom are not distinct—yet distinct, not two yet two.

Wisdom comprises three chapters: *Běnzhì* (Original Wisdom), *Guānzhì* (Observing Wisdom), and *Shēngzhì* (Born Wisdom).

*Běnzhì* (Original Wisdom) is quiescent and unmoving, observing both emptiness and being. Conventional and ultimate illumination arise within it—observing emptiness is *Guānzhì* (Observing Wisdom), observing being is *Shēngzhì* (Born Wisdom).

The Song Master said: *"Dao-Wisdom, Real-Wisdom, Expedient-Wisdom—these are the Three Wisdoms."*

*Dàozhì* (Dao-Wisdom) is the arising from the originally non-existent, first generating spontaneously, then able to transform the Dao.

*Shízhì* (Real-Wisdom) is the wisdom of observing the body and maintaining unity—since the Dao is formless, yet must manifest a body in response, teaching is given through observing the body, ordering it to abide in the spirit.

*Quānzhì* (Expedient-Wisdom) is the power of expedient means, pervasive across all realms, broadly opening the *dharma*-teachings, administering remedies suited to the ailment.

It is also said that *yì* (meaning) is *yí* (appropriateness), fittingly fulfilling the needs of all things.

Again, the Three Wisdoms in their functions are:
1. **Completing Great Compassion** – Observing all beings, originally neither non-existent nor existent, yet deluded by their false views, giving rise to perceptions of being and non-being, chasing the superficial while abandoning the root, sinking into the sea of suffering—this is what is pitiful.
2. **Transforming Beings** – Since beings are originally neither non-existent nor existent, the Sage would not transform them if they were. Because their nature is neither being nor non-being, they can be transformed.
3. **Revealing True Nature** – Since the true nature of beings is neither being nor non-being, ultimately pure and clear, this is the true Dao-nature. Eliminating partial fixations, the vulgar are mired in being, while the Sage’s single nature is taught through non-being to cure the affliction of being. Those who penetrate the mysterious understand that being is not being, and non-being is not non-being.

Again, the Threefold Body—non-dual yet dual, thus one body becomes countless bodies; dual yet non-dual, thus countless bodies are one body. Knowing this duality of non-duality, one also guides the natural—this is fitting to address.

4. **Curing Fixed Attachments** – All things have inherent natures that must realize the Dao; clinging to the notions of self and others as fixed realities.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Eight: *Zìrán* (The Doctrine of Nature)**
The meaning is this: *Zìrán* (Nature) originally lacks inherent selfhood. If it lacks inherent selfhood, what then is its origin?

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: *Zìrán* (The Doctrine of Nature)**

The originator being nonexistent, what then is its method?
If so, there is neither self nor other, neither thing nor ego—how could one fixate upon it as a constant attachment?
To sever all waiting upon *zìrán* (Nature) is fitting to address.

Explanation: It is said that *zìrán* (Nature) is merely a designation for causes and conditions, a provisional teaching to guide understanding.
Thus, "self" is the self that is not self; "thus" is the thus that is not thus.
The "thus" that is not thus has no "thus" to contradict;
The "self" that is not self has no "self" to negate.
The negation of all "self" means that the other also becomes self;
The contradiction of all "thus" means that the other also becomes thus.
When the other becomes "thus," it is also the other’s "thus."
Thus, the "thus" of the other’s "thus" is also the "thus" that is not thus;
The "thus" called "other" is also the "other" that is not other.
The "other" that is not other is without negation—
Thus, the self also becomes other;
The "thus" that is not thus is also without contradiction—
Thus, the self also becomes thus.
In this way, self and other share the same "thus" meaning.

Now, if one speaks of *zìrán* (Nature), it is because other terms involve objects and create dependence—
Once named, the designation should be severed.
Thus, the *Běnjiè Jīng* (Sutra of the Original Interface) states:
*"All worldly and transcendent laws are provisional designations,
All are causes and conditions—
Opening expedient paths to transform sentient beings,
Merely establishing names for convenience."*

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: *Dàoxìng* (The Doctrine of the Dao’s Nature)**

The meaning is this: *Dàoxìng* (the Dao’s Nature) has its principle stored in the true ultimate.
Its meaning is complete and all-pervasive—
Though it is darkly tranquil as a single source,
It also encompasses all things.
When afflictions obscure it, one temporarily lingers in mundane causes,
But once these hindrances are removed, one ascends to the sacred fruit—
This is its true purpose.

The *Tàixuān Jīng* (Sutra of the Great Mystery) states:
*"When speaking of the Dao’s Nature,
It is the true emptiness—
Neither empty nor not empty,
Nor neither empty nor not empty.
The Dao’s Nature and all sentient beings
Are fundamentally the same as *zìrán* (Nature)."*

Explanation: The Dao’s meaning is called *yuán tōng* (complete and all-pervasive), referring to the wisdom and illumination that are complete and all-pervasive.
The term *xìng* (Nature) is named for its unchanging essence—
That it must attain the complete fruit of wisdom.

When Master Kǎi (裴) expounds upon *dào* (Dao), he calls it *miào chéng* (wondrous attainment),
Or *dào yòng* (Dao’s function),
Or *xìng* (Nature).
Now, "see" refers to perceiving its realm;
"Attain" refers to the moment of realization and fruition;
"Function" refers to the hidden stage in causes,
Whereby objects support the true nature—
Thus, its function is manifest.

In the stage of causes, it is called "function" or also "true nature."
In the stage of fruition, it is called "Dao’s true body."
In the stage of causes, it is called "Dao’s nature"—
That which has the potential to attain fruition.
This interpretation, though forced, still fails to grasp the principle.

If "Dao" is fixed in fruition and "Nature" in causes,
Then "Nature" is not the true Dao, and the true Dao is not "Nature"—
How can one say that all sentient beings possess *dàoxìng* (Dao’s Nature)?

Now, if one holds the obstructed view that *dàoxìng* is either present or absent,
Then one interpretation is one affliction—
The correct meaning is that the Dao’s true Nature is neither present nor absent,
Neither in nor out.

The *Xīshēng Jīng* (Sutra of the Ascending West) states:
*"For the correct non-being, where is it located?"*
And again:
*"The correct self abides—
Yet what is not located?"*
Thus, it is without location yet without non-location.
In causes, it is causes;
In fruition, it is fruition.
In causes, it is called *causes’ Nature*;
In fruition, it is called *fruition’s Nature*.
Now, seeking the true principle of *Dàoxìng* (Dao’s Nature),
It is neither present nor absent—
What name, what Nature?

If one says "non-Nature" as Nature,
And "non-name" as name,
It is also neither comprehensible nor distinct,
Neither unified nor differentiated.

In its distinct aspect, its meaning is boundless—
Yet to summarize, it may be divided into five categories:

1. **The Correct Middle** – *Middle* is the name for non-deviation,
   *Correct* is the designation for non-perversity.
   The correct Dao and true Nature
   Neither arise nor perish,
   Neither exist nor do not exist—
   Thus, the name for the Dao is the **Correct Middle**.

2. **Causes-and-Conditions Nature** – *Cause* is the agent of generation,
   *Condition* is the reliance upon circumstances,
   Setting up realms and teachings as the causes and conditions for awakening and understanding—
   Through these causes and conditions, wisdom arises and the Dao is attained.

3. **Illumination Nature** – Also a cause,
   Generally called the dual observation of existence and non-existence,
   The illumination of the dual realm of existence and non-existence—
   Through cause, entering non-existence,
   Revealing the true realm through illumination,
   Giving rise to wondrous perception.

4. **Wisdom Nature** – This is the ultimate fruit,
   Darkly tranquil and mysteriously all-pervasive,
   The great source of wisdom.

5. **Non-Construction Nature** – This is wisdom itself,
   Severing the dual burdens of cause and fruit,
   The non-being of the divine—
   Also the Dao.

Again, the **Dao’s Nature** in its true form
Is called *Dao-fruit* when manifest,
And *Dao’s Nature* when hidden.
The **Dao’s Nature** is fundamentally pure and natural.

Even the lowest sentient beings—
Down to cattle, trees, and stones—
All possess *Dàoxìng* (Dao’s Nature).

Ultimately, all laws have their true Nature:
Neither present nor absent,
Neither cause nor fruit,
Neither form nor mind,
Without gain or loss.
Those who realize this Nature
Attain the correct Dao—
The natural, true emptiness,
Which is the Dao’s Nature.

The *Shēngxiān Jīng* (Sutra of the Ascending Mystery) states:
*"Your servant knows the Dao reverses convention—
Why is this so?
Because the law’s Nature is empty.
The Sutra states:
Those who borrow *qi* (vital energy) and inherit *qi* (vital energy)—
This reveals the fundamental nature of sentient beings,
Originally pure and clear.
Through confusion and delusion, one comes to know the mind and spirit of sentience—
When the mind arises in a single thought,
It becomes entangled in desire and defilement.
Since mundane deeds are weak,
They cannot generate themselves—
They must borrow responsive *qi* (vital energy),
Lending life and drawing connections.
Once generated, they then rely on cultivation and study—
When wisdom attains completeness,
One becomes the supreme Dao.

It is like the bamboo shoot before it rises:
Its essence lies in emptiness.
When the thought of a shoot arises,
It immediately bears skin and emerges.
Since its strength is weak, it cannot grow itself—
It must borrow the rain from heaven,
Assisting its growth into a shoot.
When it becomes bamboo,
Gradually shedding its skin,
Once all skin is removed, the bamboo is complete—
Without skin, as it was originally—
On the day the bamboo is formed,
It does not again produce skin.
Similarly, when wisdom attains completeness,
It does not again give rise to confusion."*

The *Xīshēng Jīng* (Sutra of the Ascending West) states:
*"The Dao is not solely within me—
All things possess it."*
This is based on the understanding of those who know,
Without considering the differences in sentience.

This explanation is not yet settled.
If one says that those who know have Nature,
And those who do not know lack Nature,
Then the Dao should reside in those who know,
Not in those who do not know.

「If there are those who know and those who do not know,
The Great Dao is present in all—
It must also be that both those who know and those who do not know
In truth possess Nature.

If both those who know and those who do not know possess Nature,
Then both those who are aware and those who are unaware must attain the Dao.

If there are those who are aware and those who are unaware,
And thus some attain the Dao while others do not,
Then it must also be that those who know and those who do not know
Possess Nature or lack Nature accordingly.

Now, my view is this:
The Nature of the Dao is neither form nor mind,
Yet it manifests as form and mind.
Because of mind, cultivation and practice can lead to attainment;
Because of form, even clay and stones are encompassed within it.

*End of Volume Eight of the Dao Teaching Principles*
*Volume Nine of the Dao Teaching Principles*
*Collected by Daoist Monk Meng Anpai of Qingxi*
**Thirty: The Doctrine of the Field of Merit**
The Doctrine states:
The Field of Merit illuminates the source of cause and effect,
And elucidates the principle of resources and recompense—
Like this, it is the foundation for excellence.
Goodness sprouts from it to grow,
Like fertile land yielding abundant harvests—
This is its essence.

The *Lingbao Scripture* states:
*"The Dao is the school of the formless mind,
All deeds are Fields of Merit."*

Explanation:
*Merit* (福, *fu*) signifies abundance and joy—
That is, wealth and sufficiency, with the seven treasures and all delights complete,
Or completeness in all things—
That is, all delights are fully present.
*Field* (田, *tian*) signifies the capacity to generate—
That is, it generates virtuous merit,
Filling the land with goodness—
Like the fertile fields of the world.

Thus, the *Benji Jing* (Scripture of the Fundamental Interface) states:
*"One’s own body is the Field of Merit,
And the law is the rain that nourishes it."*

The Three Treasures manifest the essence—
They are the Dao Scriptures.
The Dao Treasure:
Properly taken, the body of the Supreme Dao Lord is the Field of Merit,
Manifested as a colored form,
Personally receiving offerings and nourishment.

The Scripture Treasure:
If discussed superficially,
Teaching is mere sound and form,
Not inherently virtuous or evil in nature—
As a Field of Merit, though it can generate merit,
It lacks the capacity to sustain life.
If discussed profoundly,
The teachings are difficult to ponder,
All are virtuous applications—
As a Field of Merit, it does not merely generate merit,
But also sustains life.

The Teacher Treasure:
Among the Three Treasures, it is the primary Field of Merit.
Why?
Though the Dao is noble and exalted,
Its Nature is singular as the transformative sovereign,
Yet it is not constantly visible,
Nor does it require sustenance.
The Scripture is lofty,
Spread through human propagation.
These two Treasures do not fully manifest the Field of Merit’s essence—
Only the Teacher’s virtue stands uniquely clear.
Why?
The Teacher’s method involves mutual reliance and need.

The *Benji Jing* states:
*"This is the Teacher Treasure,
The supreme Field of Merit—
This is its meaning."*

---
**Thirty-One: The Doctrine of Pure Lands**
The Doctrine states:
Pure Lands open the path to salvation,
Relying on causes and conditions,
Nurturing sincere virtuous deeds,
And the wondrous mind’s resting place—
This is its essence.

The *Lingbao Scripture* states:
*"The Celestial Sovereigns accomplish the five Pure Lands,
Delivering all beings."*

Explanation:
Now, I elucidate the name *Pure Land* in five brief points:
1. The land where only immortals reside—
Also called the *Immortal Land*—
This is like the *Taqing* (Great Clarity).
2. The land where only True Persons reside—
Also called the *True Person Land*—
This is like the *Shangqing* (Upper Clarity).
3. The land where only Saints reside—
Also called the *Saint Land*—
This is like the *Yuqing* (Jade Clarity).
4. The land where the Celestial Sovereign is the transformative sovereign—
Called the *Celestial Sovereign Land*.
5. The land shaped by beings’ karma—
Also called the *Beings’ Land*—
Here, Celestial Sovereigns and beings intermingle,
Pure Lands arising from causes and conditions are boundless and unfathomable,
Free and unrestricted, beyond conception.

Again, the essence of Pure Lands:
In general, it refers to the Pure Land as both the dependent and independent realms.
The dependent realm:
Seven treasures adorn it,
Eight auspicious signs envelop it,
White rings encircle it with fruit,
Echoing halls resound with sacred sounds,
Pools of golden essence and jade,
Jewel towers and cloud pavilions.

The independent realm:
Longevity refined, countenance like jade and gold,
Born of pure virtue,
Everlasting, fate fulfilled—
Thus, one ascends to divinity.

This is called the *Direct Heart Name*.

The *Pure Land Scripture* states:
*"When the three deeds are pure,
The six senses become pure,
And when the six senses are pure,
The land is pure."*

The *Hidden Heavenly Inner Vision* states:
*"The four directions’ lands share the same daily moon’s revolution—
This is the preservation of dawn and dusk."*

The *Taiping Scripture* states:
*"The Celestial Above measures the world:
Ten thousand years as one day,
Then ten thousand years as one day,
Then one thousand years as one day,
Then one hundred years as one day,
And finally, ten days as one day."*

---
**Thirty-Two: The Doctrine of the Three Worlds**
The Doctrine states:
The Three Worlds involve the meaning of past and future,
Named as arising and passing away.
If one forgets and abandons all existence,
One transcends the body of desire,
Realizing the boundless—
Thus, one treads the path of Non-Action.
This is its essence.

Explanation:
1. The *Past*:
*"Past"* means to have crossed over,
*"Gone"* means to have departed—
That is, what has already passed and crossed over.
2. The *Present*:
*"Present"* means to be manifest,
*"In"* means to exist—
That is, what is manifest and exists now.
3. The *Future*:
*"Future"* means not yet sprouted,
*"Come"* means about to emerge—
This is the general meaning of *worlds*,
Where the law of arising and passing away applies—
The law of *becoming* replaces the old with the new.

It is also called the *Three Existences*:
The past has already existed,
The present exists now,
The future will exist.

The *Dongzhen Scripture* states:
*"Once, beings took vows with sincere hearts;
Now, learners all enter the path;
In the future, they will be born into virtuous families."*

In general, *existence* refers to:
What has passed and perished—
Called the *past*;
What exists in the present moment—
Called the *present*;
What will perish and be reborn—
Called the *future*.

One law discussed in the Three Worlds:
If a law has not yet arisen, it is the *future*;
When this law begins to manifest, it is the *present*;
When this law perishes today, it is the *past*.

It is also said:
The initial thought, once extinguished, is the *past*;
The subsequent thought, not yet arisen, is the *future*;
The middle thought, already born, is the *present*.

All are conditioned and impermanent—
The ever-changing, shifting, and perishing.

In general, it is said that all is ultimately the **Three Times** of arising, abiding, and perishing,
Which shift and transform into the **Three Worlds**.

**The Thirty-Third Chapter on the Five Turbidities** states:
*"The Five Turbidities refer to the decline of the age,
The multitude of afflictions among beings,
The chaotic affairs of the *Jiao* (浇) and the *Feng* (浮),
The accumulation of dust and defilements,
Seeking to release beings from the cage of the Three Realms,
And guide them into the wondrous domain of the One Source.
This is their intent."*

**Explanation** follows:
1. **The Turbidity of Afflictions** (烦恼浊) refers to the universal desire,
Which burdens practitioners with vexations,
Hence it is called the *Turbidity of Afflictions*.
2. **The Turbidity of Views** (见浊) refers to the discriminative desire,
Which clings to distinctions and attachments,
Hence it is called the *Turbidity of Views*.
3. **The Turbidity of Life** (命浊) speaks to its brevity,
Where form and mind are bound together,
Hence it is called *Life*.
4. **The Turbidity of Birth and Death** (生死浊) refers to beings,
Whose births are not singular,
Hence it is called *Birth and Death*,
For birth must inevitably lead to decay and destruction.
5. **The Turbidity of Time and Fate** (时运浊) clarifies the end of the age,
The *Jiao* (浇) and *Feng* (浮) of the final era,
The calamities of the Three Disasters,
And the influence of *Karmic lifespans*,
Hence it is called *Time and Fate*.

The *Scriptures* say:
*"Pitying those yet to come,
As time and fate grow turbid with afflictions,
With calamities of war, pestilence, water, and fire—
Countless diseases arise."*

As for the **Five Turbidities in essence**,
The *Turbidities of Afflictions* and *Views* (烦恼、见二浊) take the *mind* as their form;
*The Turbidity of Life* and *Birth and Death* (命与生) take *form and mind* as their form;
*The Turbidity of Time and Fate* (时运) takes the *conventional and ultimate truths* as its form.

The **Five Turbidities in essence** clarify the chaos of time,
For their forms exist without fixed duration.

The reason for the **Two Desires** (离欲) is this:
Desire is divided into universal and discriminative,
Hence it is called *Two Desires*.

*Life* and *Birth* share the same conventional designation,
Yet are split into two, for ordinary beings delight in birth and cling to life,
Thus, they are two kinds of *Birth*,
Which is called *Life*—
The continuity of their forms.

Among the **Five Turbidities**, there are degrees of severity—
How so?
The first two are more severe,
For they are the root of the turbidity.
The last three are less severe,
Yet they too encompass the **Five Turbidities**.

Even in the Pure Land,
It is said that beings undergo transmigration and birth-and-death,
That they have *impermanent lifespans*,
And that they are subject to *time and fate*.

If one speaks of the **Five Turbidities** in the context of the *Saints*,
Then they are not discussed.

As for the **Three Disasters** (三灾),
They are war, pestilence, and water-and-fire calamities.

The *Scripture of the Original Source* (《本际经》) states:
*"War, pestilence, and water-and-fire calamities,
If they arise in the assembly of the *Yang Jiu* (阳九) of 960 small *Karmic lifespans*,
Then these are the **Three Disasters**."*

It is also said:
*"Warfare is a *Disaster*;
Great sickness is a *Disaster*;
Water-and-fire is a *Disaster*.
These are the **Three Disasters** that arise,
At the end of the three small *Karmic lifespans*."*

It is further said:
*"At the end of one small *Karmic lifespan*,
All three calamities manifest."*

The *Scriptural precepts* (经戒) declare:
*"The calamities of water-and-fire,
These are the warfare and pestilence that sweep through all households,
The cleansing waves of water-and-fire."*

Yet, the *Yang Jiu* (阳九) has both great and small distinctions.
Master Lu (陆先生) said:
*"Four hundred and fifty-six years constitute a *Yang Jiu* (阳九),
And ten *Yang Jiu* (阳九) amount to four thousand five hundred and sixty years—
This is one *Yuan* (元),
Where these three calamities arise;
Three hundred and sixty years constitute a *Bai Liu* (百六),
Which also brings these calamities—
This is the small *Yang Jiu* (阳九) of 960 years.
If four hundred and fifty-six thousand years constitute a *Yang Jiu Yuan* (阳九元),
And three thousand six hundred years constitute a *Bai Liu Zhou* (百六周),
Then this is the great *Yang Jiu* (阳九) of 960 years."*

The *Scripture of the Celestial and Terrestrial Cycles* (《天地运度经》) states:
*"Three thousand three hundred years are the small *Yang Jiu* (阳九) and small *Bai Liu* (百六);
Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety years are the great *Yang Jiu* (阳九) and great *Bai Liu* (百六).
Celestial calamities are called *Yang Jiu* (阳九);
Terrestrial calamities are called *Bai Liu* (百六)."*

**The Ninth Chapter of the *Daoist Canon of Principles* concludes.**
**The Tenth Chapter of the *Daoist Canon of Principles* begins.**

**The Thirty-Fourth Chapter on *Dynamic Stillness* (动寂义) concludes.**
**The Thirty-Fifth Chapter on *Responsive Correspondence* (感应义) begins.**

**The Thirty-Fifth Chapter on *Responsive Correspondence* (感应义):**
The meaning of *Responsive Correspondence* (感应) is this: It arises from the interplay of *conditions and occasions* (机缘), manifesting between the profane and the sage. The principles of good and evil, once established like form and sound, yield no discrepancies in their fruits. They return as reflections and echoes—this is its essence.

The *Scripture of the Cavernous Spirit* (《洞神经》) states:
*"The enlightened and wise sage-teacher reveals the *texts* (文) to meet the needs of *conditions and occasions* (机用), employs them to respond to *sensations* (感), and through *sensations* (感) harmonizes the *texts* (文). When harmonized, it achieves sainthood."*

**Explication:**
*Sensation* (感) is the term for the *dynamic* (动) and *seeking* (求) of ordinary emotions;
*Responsive* (应) is the name for the *sage’s Dao* (圣道) *attending and meeting* (赴接).

In terms of *Responsive Correspondence* (感应) and its essence, the traditional interpretation posits six *sensations* (六感) and six *responses* (六应).
The six *sensations* (六感) are:
1. *Rectified Sensation* (正感) – the principle of *dynamic seeking* (动求) originates directly from the heart.
2. *Attached Sensation* (附感) – earth and wood, lacking sentience, cannot produce life on their own; thus, their efficacy relies on attachment to sentient beings.
3. *Universal Sensation* (普感) – at the beginning of the *aeon* (劫), when all was pure, the sage responded to the *Lord of Great Peace* (太平之主), evoking shared sensation.
   The *Preface to the True Texts* (《真文序》) says:
   *"Establishing the state of the realm to correspond with the *classics and documents* (图书),
   Guiding the Five *Qi* (五气) to nurture the myriad people—
   This is *Universal Sensation* (普感)."*
4. *Partial Sensation* (偏感) – as time grows impure, people lose their innate goodness. For instance, *Guan Yin* (关尹) alone evoked the *Year of the Lord* (周年), while *Ge Xuan* (葛玄) alone responded to the *Age of the Bright World* (昊世)—this is *Partial Sensation* (偏感).
5. *Manifest Sensation* (显感) – heard throughout the four seas, seen by all the people, such as the *Han Sage* (汉文) summoning the *River Deity* (河上), or *Xuanyuan* (轩辕) convening at *Ding Lake* (鼎湖)—this is *Manifest Sensation* (显感).
6. *Hidden Sensation* (隐感) – sometimes dwelling alone in secluded peaks, like *Yang Xi* (杨羲) entering the *Han Cavern* (汉乍), or residing in a tranquil chamber, or *Xu Yan* (许掾) ascending to the *Celestial Tower* (凌霄)—this is *Hidden Sensation* (隐感).

The six *responses* (六应) are:
1. *Qi Response* (气应) – the *Primordial Qi* (元气) disperses and transforms, giving rise to all things.
2. *Form Response* (形应) – in the ancient times, when the sun shone above and the moon illuminated below, before *texts* (文) were employed, *forms* (形) governed all things.
3. *Text Response* (文应) – as the sentiments of things grew impure, transformation required *teachings* (言教).
   Master Xu says: *"The *Qi* of the Soaring Mystic* (飞玄) condenses into *texts* (文), forming the void."*
4. *Sage Response* (圣应) – when the sentiments of beings grow impure, sages must emerge to serve as their *foundations* (栋宇) and *garments* (垂衣裳), enabling them to recognize the source of *dharma* (理) and name all things correctly.
5. *Worthy Response* (贤应) – [untranslated, as the original text cuts off here]
6. *Inheriting Response* (袭应) – [untranslated]

**5. *Worthy Response* (贤应者)**
When the Sage has already acted in advance, the Worthy elucidates the principles that follow.

**6. *Inheriting Response* (袭应者)**
"Clothing" (袭) means transmission. Though the Worthy and Sage may conceal their brilliance, ordinary people transmit their teachings. Though called "twofold folly," they still open the way for gatherings—this is what is meant by *Inheriting Response*.

**Fourfold Sentient-Insentient Response (有情无情感应有四句)**
1. Sentient responding to insentient: as when weeping over bamboo that sprouts, or shooting arrows that strike stone and drink their own feathers.
2. Insentient responding to sentient: as when blessed lands attract the worthy, or sacred mountains gather sages.
3. Insentient responding to insentient: as when the copper mountain collapses and the great bell rings in response.
4. Sentient responding to sentient: this meaning is self-evident.

**Thirty-Sixth Principle: The Doctrine of Being and Non-Being (有无义第三十六)**
Being and non-being arise from teachings. Through the duality of form and emptiness, if one perceives that there is no substance yet it is not non-being, then true observation is born, knowing that there is a body yet it is not being, thus transcending delusion. This is its essence.

Being and non-being are two names born of false constructs.
*The Golden Liquid Scripture* says:
*"If one clings to being, one is deeply confused;
To delight in non-being is also not enlightenment.
True observation forgets both—
Together they return to the Mysterious."*

Since it is said to forget both,
And then to forget what is forgotten,
Knowledge vanishes in being and non-being,
The spirit condenses in the Triple Mystery—
This is what those who exhaust principles and perfect nature embody.

**Explication:**
Being is defined by obstruction; non-being by emptiness and openness. This is a coarse explanation.
As for subtle non-being:
It is neither substance nor obstruction,
Yet it can be substance and obstruction,
Neither empty nor open,
Yet it can be empty and open.

Now, a unified explanation for the four cases:
1. Being has a name; non-being has none.
   Names call forth substance—
   Where there is substance, names can be called forth;
   Where there is no substance, names cannot be called forth.

2. Non-being has a name; being has none.
   Being is false and insubstantial, unworthy of a name;
   Non-being is true and real, thus worthy of a name.
   Hence, *The Scripture of the Origin* says:
   *"Non-being is the Dao."*

3. As Master Meng expounds, this is also the naming of being and non-being through mutual dependence.

4. When one comprehends being and non-being in essence,
   Ultimately pure and tranquil,
   Beyond conception—
   Thus, they have no name.
   To accommodate common understanding, it is explained as in the third case.

**The Substance and Function of Being and Non-Being (有无体用者):**
Master Meng says:
*"Gold is hard, fire is hot, water is moist, wind is light—
These are deemed to have substance.
Non-being is vast and open—
Substance cannot be established;
It relies on principle to manifest forms,
Taking the formless as substance."*

Master Xuanzheng explains:
*"Where there is law, there is function;
Where there is substance, there is name.
Where there is no law, there is no function;
Where there is no substance, there is no name."*

He also says:
*"Non-being’s substance and function
Should properly have no name,
Yet for teaching’s sake, names are provisionally established.
Substance and function are inherently self-sufficient;
Names are externally imposed,
Thus, though past teachings may exhaust substance and function,
Their names endure, transmitted through distant ages."*

Master Xu says:
*"Where there is law, there is name;
Where there is substance, there is function.
Where there is no law, there is no name;
Where there is no function, there is no substance."*

Now, this interpretation is difficult.
If one posits function to establish substance,
And substance is nonexistent,
How can function exist?
All things with form are obstructed and cannot act—
Only through non-being can action occur.
Function belongs to being;
How could it pertain to non-being?

**Examples of Being and Non-Being (有无义例者):**
Master Xuanzheng says: *"Being is inferior; non-being is superior."*
Why?
Being obstructs; non-being flows.
Being is impermanent; non-being is eternal.

Now, the two principles of being and non-being
Mutually obstruct and mutually flow,
Mutually excel and mutually fall short.
Non-being, as obstruction, is like a broken bridge—
Wood may still pass through, yet it is non-doing.
Being, as flow, is like a bridge that connects—
This is doing.

Where doing excels, it has the power to mend what is broken;
Where non-doing excels, it has the power to govern what is constant.
Thus, the meaning of being and non-being
Is neither fixed in obstruction nor flow,
Nor is their superiority or inferiority absolute.
Flow and non-flow are as such;
Permanence and impermanence are likewise.

*The Scripture of Ascension* says:
*"What is permanent can be made impermanent;
What is impermanent can be made permanent.
Thus, being and non-being,
Permanence and impermanence—
None can be definitively fixed."*

But their meanings follow circumstances,
Depending on human grasping.
Examining their true nature,
Ultimately, all is empty.
Thus, being and non-being are provisional;
Neither being nor non-being is true.

*The Scripture of Ascension* says:
*"The Dao is not solely within me—
All things possess it."*

*The Laozi Teaching* says:
*"The Dao is nowhere absent.
Being is subtle being;
Non-being is subtle non-being.
By this reasoning,
How could the Dao be separate from being and non-being?
Thus, profound discourse on being and non-being
Exhausts all meaning—
Yet knowing all dharmas
Are not merely boundless,
But originally devoid of all existence,
What is there to exhaust or contain?"*

Now, when we speak of "containing,"
It is non-being that contains all—
Non-being contains everything.
When we speak of "exhaustion,"
It is non-being that exhausts all—
Non-being exhausts everything.

**Thirty-Seventh Principle: The Doctrine of Provisional and Real (假实义第三十七)**
Provisional and real:
Clarifying the true and false of all things,
Distinguishing the harmony and separation of all ranks.
If one knows that non-being is dependent on being,
Then non-being is understood,
And self and others are pure.
When one can clarify how provisional arises from the real,
Then one comprehends that the nature of color is originally empty—
This is its essence.

The Scripture says:
*"The Four Great Elements temporarily reside;
The Five Aggregates are provisionally established."*

**Examples of Provisional and Real (假实义例者):**
The origin of all laws lies in the two *qi* of yin and yang.
From these two *qi*, the Five Dusts are formed,
Which give rise to the Four Great Elements and Five Constants,
Which together form the Five Roots and Nine Orifices.

**Provisional and Real (continued)**

Moreover, the fundamental *dharma* derives its reality from the two *qi* of yin and yang.
Yet when the Five Dusts are considered real, it is because the two *qi* are still formless and indeterminate,
and thus do not serve as the basis for the provisional formation of *dharma*.

However, yang is the *qi* of generation, and yin is the *qi* of destruction.
The meaning of generation and destruction can serve as the basis for the provisional continuity of *dharma*.
But that which can generate all things is yang *qi*,
and that which can destroy all things is yin *qi*.
All things undergo neither generation nor destruction,
and thus all things receive the two *qi* of yin and yang.
Yin and yang are the *qi* of *dharma*,
yet they too can generate and destroy.
Since the myriad *qi* are not the *dharma* of mind,
they cannot be generated or destroyed by mind.
This statement that the two *qi* can generate and destroy
does not mean they act spontaneously through time,
but rather that they possess the distinct capacity to generate and destroy within yin and yang themselves—
this is the power to generate and destroy all things,
and this is the generation and destruction.

The mind, not being generated by yin and yang,
yet still undergoing generation and destruction,
is precisely the nature of mind that cannot abide,
allowing it to traverse past and future—
this is the principle of impermanence.

Master Xuánjìng (玄靖) classified the Five Dusts as Five *Qi*,
and within these Five *Qi* there are three varieties:
1. the singular *qi*,
2. the shared *qi*,
3. and that which is both singular and shared.

The Dusts are seven in kind:
1. luminosity,
2. darkness,
3. shadow,
4. sound,
5. singular scent,
6. singular taste,
7. singular substance.

These seven varieties are still the three aforementioned kinds,
but they are all singular in one aspect—
they do not combine with other Dusts,
nor do they form any configuration,
and thus they are provisional *dharma* in isolation.

The shared Dusts are five in number,
namely the five colors, five scents, etc.

These five, if not generated, are as they are,
but when generated, they coalesce in one place,
forming all *dharma*.
Though they share a single location,
their intrinsic natures remain distinct and separate,
and thus they are real.

The singular Dusts have nothing to share with others,
their reality is evident.

As for the shared Dusts,
when generated, they occupy the same space—
how can one know their essences do not merge into one?
If they merge into one,
then within color there would be taste,
and within scent there would be sound—
this would not be a difference in nature.

Now, if we verify this with the singular Dusts,
we know their natures are separate,
just as a pillar’s shadow arises solely from the color Dust.
If taste were within color,
then shadow could persist,
but shadow is merely color,
and thus color contains no taste.
The same applies to the remaining Dusts—
they are merely chaotic and intermingling,
never blending into a single whole.
Yet when no gaps are seen,
it is like a well-made wooden puppet,
sealed together without space.

That which is both singular and shared is the *qi* of wind.
The nature of wind *qi*
either exists alone in the void,
not forming any *dharma*, like the fierce winds of the outer world,
or combines with all phenomena to constitute form,
such as the breath of sentient beings.
Though it may be either singular or shared,
its essence is singular—
it is but one thing,
and thus it is a real *dharma*.

Now, examining the *qi* of wind,
it is merely the Dust of touch,
as it is known only by the body root,
not perceived by the nose or eyes.

Those who can hear the wind
are indeed hearing objects producing sound,
not the wind itself resonating.
Even those who see black wind
are seeing wind that blows black particles,
and thus it enters the eye root.
Wind *qi* is not related to sound or color,
yet Zhuāngzi (庄) said, "The Great Clod is wind,"
which seems to imply it should have color.
Now it is clarified that wind *qi* is without green or yellow hues,
and thus Guō Xiāng (郭象) said, "The Great Clod is wind"
because it is formless—
it is nothingness.

Since the Dust of touch belongs to the sense of touch,
yet wind is separately called the "Great" *qi*,
it is because among the five singular Dusts,
wind is the most potent and pervasive,
its function surpassing all other Dusts,
and thus it is distinguished as the "Great."

Furthermore, the *dharma* of mind is of two kinds:
1. the formless mind,
2. and the mind dependent on form.

The formless mind is the great *Dao* wisdom,
ascending into the formless realm.
If it stands alone,
this wisdom does not share existence with other *dharma*.
It is not called "distinct"
because it can forget self and others,
and abandon all differentiation—
this is its essence.

Now, I clarify this by addressing those who perceive color.
Yet the great *Dao*,
neither color nor mind,
can manifest as both color and mind,
and is present in all things.
The mind dependent on form has two varieties:
1. the mind dependent on distinct form,
which is the Five Passions,
arising from the Five Roots’ distinct forms.
2. The mind dependent on the total form,
which is the mind-emotion,
as it cannot yet be without reliance,
and depends on the seven-foot dwelling of the body.

Though it relies on form,
it has good and evil functions,
yet it cannot be separated from distinctness—
it is not a different *dharma* formed,
and thus it is called real.

The Four Observations (四念) are linked,
this is the provisional continuity of *dharma*.
