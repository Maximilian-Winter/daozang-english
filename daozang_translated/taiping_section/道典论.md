The *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* states: The Central Yellow Elder Lord is a disciple of the Supreme August Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven.

In the second year of the Qingxu Shanghuang era, amidst primordial chaos, he first came into being. The sun’s radiance doubled in splendor, its light interwoven with the numinous. Five-colored clouds formed a canopy, while auspicious mist and mysterious haze settled in stillness.

At the age of seven, he naturally grasped the essentials of longevity and the methods of celestial transcendence. With profound contemplation, he reverently embraced the mysterious and true, his spirit wandering in solitude, his heart dwelling in the wellspring of the divine. He widely embodied the eight absolutes, grasped emptiness and cast forth gold, freed himself from the nets of ornate entanglement, and roamed unbound through the marketplace of the void. His eyes opened the gate of the mysterious origin, his hands parted the halls of the myriad chambers. Thus, the celestial melody exquisitely resounded, and karmic resonance with the mysterious arose.

Thereupon, the Supreme August One bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Nine Perfected* of the Emperor Lord and the secret chapters of the Eight Dao. Through cultivation, he achieved the Dao and received the scriptures, becoming the Perfected of the Great Ultimate.

The *Scripture of the Golden Root in Purple Script* states: The Azure Essence Emperor Lord is a disciple of the Nine Yang Primordial Jade Emperor. In the first year of the Zhonghuang era, in the year corresponding to the Eastern Pivot of Heaven, he first announced his radiance to the Lord of Light and was nurtured in the Jasper Forest of the Seven Treasures beneath the boundless Heaven of the Jade Mound in the Jade Land of the Mystic Mound. At the edge of the ninefold domains, his dharma-transformations aligned with the celestial patterns. For three dawns, the morning light broke forth. Nine dragons flanked his side, while seven-colored jasper phoenixes shaded his body. Divine unicorns and sacred mushrooms emitted mysterious radiance, celestial maidens exhaled essence to nourish his perfection, jade lads cast flowers to dispel impurity, and divine consorts scattered incense to repel dust.

He practiced fetal breathing and natural refinement. At the age of twelve, his face shone with a golden countenance, his body bore sacred talismans, his words chimed like golden ornaments, and seventy-two hues luminously reflected his jade form. For three mornings, the celestial net enveloped him; the six *qi* turned in unison. A mysterious canopy of purple spirit arose from his chamber, and the flowing essence of light illuminated his courtyard. Alone, he embodied the perfected and flourished, his spirit harmonious and his demeanor orderly, following the transformations of the cosmos, rising and sinking with its currents. His heart dwelled in the realm of luminous rosy clouds, and he roamed the jade precincts of the Jade Land. Wielding the staff of the Primordial August One, he traversed the ninefold domains and the mounds of the setting sun, carefree and gazing afar.

After countless kalpas, he returned to the cloud chambers of the pure retreat. There, purple clouds formed his dwelling, rosy clouds his city, yellow gold his palace, and white jade his couch. The five *qi* intertwined, his terrace rose in layered heights, jade steps adorned with patterns, phoenix towers facing the four directions. Golden lads attended his side, jade maidens held his towels. Over five thousand celestial transcendents arrayed as guards, celestial beasts in formation, feathered riders like scales, dragons and tigers warding off evil, paired and crouching in symmetry. The ninefold convergence of mysterious *qi*, the divine wind stirring the mist, fragrant incense wafting ceaselessly through the jasper palace, flowing essence and jade light penetratingly illuminating the Eight Heavens.

Azure Essence is an alternate name of the Purple Clarity Emperor Lord. He received the Purple Script’s wondrous formulas from the Primordial Jade Emperor—all essential secrets of the myriad scriptures, celestial writings of the Nine Heavens, and hidden texts of the Eight Assemblies.

The Jade Emperor commanded the Highest Direct Perfected, the General Lord of Transcendents, to compile and edit the precious catalog, gathering them into the *Scripture of Collective Praise*. With purple brush, he transcribed the texts, inscribing them on golden tablets—all derived from the Way of the Primordial Sovereign of Antiquity, composed by the loftiest sages, compiled into scrolls, and transmitted to the Azure Essence Emperor Lord.

The *Scripture of Purple Radiance and Blazing Light* states: The Emperor Lord of the Supreme Tenuity Heaven was born at the inception of the Primordial Azure, an heir of the numinous radiance. At the very beginning when the mysterious *qi* had yet to coalesce, he took form as the lineage of flowing fragrance. His light interwove with the numinous, purple clouds blazed like lightning, mysterious mist enveloped the sky, and cinnabar radiance entwined him. Subtle awakening arose in concealment. He gathered and embraced the supreme harmony, unfolding the pure and harmonious. Exhaling and inhaling the dark abyss, he descended into the womb of emptiness and birth, nourished by the curved mushrooms of the vast spring. At the inception of his form, he studied the Way of summoning the perfected. With distant thoughts and far-reaching vision, he inwardly contemplated, sitting in observation of the boundless, profoundly preserving the hidden and void.

At the age of three, he rectified the center and aligned with correctness. His true spirit became luminous, and he foresaw what had not yet come to pass. He thoroughly examined the farthest reaches of the celestial realms—no hidden place was not discerned, no height was not seen, no depth was not peered into.

At the age of fourteen, his golden countenance inwardly shone, and jade splendor outwardly reflected. His wisdom was penetrating, his spirit keen. He bore the title of Emperor of the Lateral Hall, his duty to purify the rosy clouds of the Nine Empyreans and gaze afar upon the source of the Clarity of the Void. He illuminated the mechanisms of the utmost mystery, governed and synthesized the currents of the myriad streams. Accumulated resonance added to the hidden convergence, and wondrous resonance arose naturally. Thus, he received the title of Supreme Emperor, the accumulation of resonance bestowed upon him—not merely granted by birth.

The *Scripture of the Three Flowers’ Precious Radiance and Inner Circle* states: The Southern Culmen, General Controller of the Registers, Supreme Perfected Lord of Prohibitions, in the first year of the Shihuang era, the year corresponding to *renwu*, on the seventh day of the seventh month at midday, in the Jasper Forest beneath the Seven Treasures of the Boundless Longevity Heaven’s Jade Land, the Phoenix Capital’s Purple Terrace, bowed his head at the Jade Pavilion and inquired of the Jade Emperor, the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void: Though the celestial heir and imperial foundation have had their names inscribed in the imperial records and have ascended to the highest office, overseeing the myriad transcendents, they have yet to receive the methods of bestowing the mandate of salvation. I wish to be granted the precious formulas to save later worthies.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void addressed the Southern Culmen, General Controller, Supreme Perfected Lord of Prohibitions: The formulas for extending life and reversing years in the Golden Chamber are secretly preserved in the Nine Heavens above, in the Palace of Great Existence, the Ninefold Chamber of the Golden Terrace and Jade Hall. This Way is profoundly subtle; it is not something that median perfected ones can participate in or practice. This method shares the same root as the nine *qi* and equals the radiance of the Three Luminaries. Heaven and Earth endure forever. If cultivated ten thousand times, one’s rank will be elevated to that of an immortal minister. Riding the mist and driving the void, one will ascend to the imperial throne. I now reveal this to you—follow and practice it.

The *Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Genealogy of the Primordial August One* fully lists the eight hundred Dao Lords by name and title, which are not recorded here.

The Great Spirit:
The *Canon of the Supreme Perfected* of the Supreme August One states: The Great Void, the Great Primordial—without beginning, without origin—contains a Great Spirit, formless yet existent, possessing wisdom and numinosity. His numinous wisdom and understanding penetratingly illuminate all beings. When beings have resonance, the Great Spirit descends in response, responding as the master of resonance. He is called the Great Spirit.

The *Scripture of Laozi’s Admonitions* states: The divine person embodies the Dao and penetrates the numinous, transforming and responding to causes. Without form yet taking form, now vanishing, now abiding—dispersed, they become qi; gathered, they become human. They come and go without gate, enter and exit without gap, ascending to heaven and descending to earth, operating within the Six Directions. Where the Dao resides, they manifest as human omens; without being summoned, they arrive; without being called, they respond. They bestow mysterious merit and profound transformations in secret, their name beyond naming—thus they are called the divine person.

The *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity* states: Within it is the divine being who saves people from death; within it is the Controller of Horses, the great divine being who saves the world; within it is the Venerable Divine Being of the Southern Heights who saves from calamity; the boundless great divine beings who grant immortality and save the world.

**Flying Immortals**
The *Scripture of Illuminating Perfection* states: The Heavenly Worthy then commanded the summoning of the flying immortals and divine persons of the ten directions. They opened the repository of the Long Night, the Nine Dark Jade Caskets, and brought forth the *Illuminating Perfection’s Codes and Precepts* to save the youths.

The *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity* states: Today, the records of all heavens are examined beneath the imperial canopy. "Today" here collectively refers to the mornings of the Three Origins and Eight Festivals’ fasting vigils, when the flying immortals of the ten directions and all great sages assemble at Jade Capital to review and determine the registers. On that day, the Heavenly Worthy celebrates with a grand audience beneath the canopy.

The **Eastern Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Southern Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Western Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Northern Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Northeastern Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Southeastern Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Southwestern Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Northwestern Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Upper Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Lower Limitless Flying Immortal Divine King, Great Sage of Eternal Life**, boundlessly saves humanity.
The **Perfected Flying Immortal Divine Kings of the Ten Directions, Great Sages of Eternal Life who boundlessly save the world**, all ride flying clouds, crimson chariots, and green carriages, with a hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders, arriving through the void.

**Youths**
The *Scripture of the Five Refinements of the Numinous Treasure to Revive the Corpse* states: At that time, the Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Grove Garden of the Abode of Eternal Joy, teaching and transforming seven thousand two hundred and forty youths. When the Dharma matters were roughly complete, the most wise youths addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Now that all has been opened and renewed, the August Dao flows freely, and its blessings extend to the ten directions. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to continue bestowing great compassion and fulfill the August Grace."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy universally commanded the Celestial Emperors of all heavens to open the Dharma gates anew for the most wise youths.

The *Scripture of the Purple Radiance of Blazing Light* states:
The **Eastern Azure Radiance Youth**, named Azure Supreme Jade, styled Flying Upright, his body the color of blue-green mist, his flowing light shining brilliantly.
The **Southern Crimson Radiance Youth**, named Cinnabar Splendor, styled Mysterious Record, his body the color of red mist, his flowing light mirroring the southern direction.
The **Western White Radiance Youth**, named Vast Splendor, styled Returning Spirit Child, his body the color of white mist, his flowing light shining brilliantly.
The **Northern Black Radiance Youth**, named Mysterious Brightness Supreme, styled Supreme Yin Script, his body the color of black mist, his flowing light penetratingly illuminating the northern direction.
The **Central Yellow Radiance Youth**, named Upholding Loyalty, styled Yellow Register Child, his body the color of yellow mist, like the essence of yellow gold, his flowing light resplendent.

The *Scripture of Supreme Wisdom* praises:
Golden flowers hold the *Cavern Scripture*,
Fragrant incense is borne by all immortal youths.
Their whistling songs resound through the Mysterious Capital,
Jade chimes strike the jasper bells.

The *Scripture of Ascending to the Mystery* states: The **Golden Radiance Youth**.

*(Descriptions of attire and appearance follow.)*

The *Scripture of the Arrayed Records of the Three Heavenly Lords of Highest Clarity* states: The **Lesser Wild Youth**.

*(Descriptions of terrestrial and mountain ranks follow.)*

The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: The **Primordial Origin Youth**.

*(Descriptions of terrestrial, mountain, and cavern ranks follow.)*

**Great Beings**
The *Scripture of Ascending to the Mystery* states: The Most High said: "Dao-ling, you may exchange greetings with this Great Being." This Great Being is named Excellent Victory. Having long cultivated pure practices, his merits and accomplishments are complete, no different from yours.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Perfected’s Codes* states: Those of the Lesser Vehicle who study perilous demonic disturbances are not saved but remain bound to the Six Heavens. Thus, the Great Being arouses the mind toward the Supreme Vehicle, where merits are lofty and virtue weighty, and demons cannot corrupt. Though they come to harass, all immediately submit and surrender. Having surrendered and received their duties, they transform their bodies into the real. If they cannot transform instantly, they remain among the demonic hosts, who recommend and protect them, assisting the students to ascend to the Mystery.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Numinous Writ of the Jade Pivot* states: The Great Being of the Supreme Vehicle boundlessly saves and delivers. Delving into the ultimate Dao, penetrating the source of wisdom, unwavering from beginning to end, their person suffices to save beings. They attain transcendence and unite with the treasure.

The first fascicle of the *Discourses on Daoist Canons* concludes.

*(Dunhuang manuscript variant: "void" as "numinous." Additionally, the Dunhuang manuscript includes preceding text: "...moon, his head crowned with the Seven Treasures of Heavenly Origin, clad in a cloud-light brocade skirt sewn with nine-colored pearls, girded with Six Mountain Fire Jade, and belted with the Purple Cord of Numinous Flight. He constantly stands upon a five-colored lion lotus, resplendent in the seventy-four directions of Highest Clarity. In the autumn months, his form changes—a human head upon a tiger’s body, adorned with dark and yellow patterns, his radiant cloud-light illuminating a thousand directions. By the end of the third month, his form changes again—his entire body golden, his head bearing a floral canopy, clad in a thirty-two-colored Dharma robe, like the image of the Buddha, his luminosity brilliant, illuminating Highest Clarity.")*

In the spring months, his form transforms into a tri-colored radiance of purple, yellow, and green, intertwining and coiling, the Three Qi merging in primordial chaos within the realm of Highest Clarity. The Vast Luminance Purple Orchid Middle Origin Lofty Maiden, her stature spanning thirty million *zhang*. In the autumn months, her head crowned with a Three-Flowered Treasure Diadem, clad in a seven-colored robe of divine essence, girded with a flowing gold purple sash, and bearing a stone-essence sword of golden light, she ever stands upon azure mist, her seven-colored tiger chariot resplendent in thirty-two hues of luminosity.

In the winter months, her form changes—a tiger’s body with a dragon’s head, adorned with five-colored patterns, her brilliance radiant amidst the azure clouds, upon a five-colored lotus. In the spring months, she transforms once more—three-headed phoenix, nine-colored patterns, her luminosity dazzling, illuminating Highest Clarity. In the summer months, her form shifts into a dual radiance of purple and azure, intertwining and coiling like the rising sun.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Perfection’s Regulations* states: At the dawn of creation, sagely perfected immortals all proclaimed the Dao and qi, established dharmic forms, and transmitted them to those of the same lineage. The Most High called them "scholars," for they took the Dao as their affair—hence, the "affair of the Dao." Through merit in the affair of the Dao, they were titled "Daoists." The Daoist takes the Dao as their affair, and through sagely destiny ascends and transcends.

When the multitude of demons arise, it is due to the shallowness of human sentiment. Though the perverse may assail the upright, when the true departs, the perverse arrive, mingling with perverse people yet never encroaching upon the upright. The upright who serve the Dao, study the dharma, and follow the regulations—how would demon kings dare disrespect them, or perverse spirits dare invade?

Thus, those who receive the Dao in body are all high officials of the heavenly demons, while the multitude of heavenly demon spirits are all subordinate officials to the Daoists.

The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: The worthy and the vulgar differ in every affair. Their eyes do not wander, nor are they startled by beauty; their ears do not heed slander, nor listen to chaotic sounds; their noses do not accept fragrance, nor the stench of the sweet; their mouths do not taste delicacies, nor consume living beings; their hearts do not crave wealth, beauty, or fleeting glory; their hands do not act deceitfully; their feet do not tread evil paths. Such are the practices of the Daoist.

The *Scripture of the Great Vows and Precepts* states: The man of the Dao takes from his own body and seeks nothing from others. The Dao says: Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true. This is the meaning.

The *Scripture of the Abyssal Cavern* states: Noble Daoists are all born from the heavens above. Without prior lives’ accumulation of goodness, one cannot become a Daoist.

The *Scripture of the Orthodox Unity Perfected One’s Exposition of the Thousand Illuminations* states: Daoists of pure virtue who have traversed the Three Vehicles, teach and transform all beings, perform myriad good deeds, and act in accordance with the dharma may advance to offer veneration to the Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Perfection’s Numinous Writ of the Great Empyrean* states: Understanding must be single-minded; single-mindedness must yield response; response then communicates with the divine—why labor over invocation? Joy and sorrow both abandoned, day and night diligently devoted, vowing to advance without retreat—this is called a "man of the Dao." One who practices the Great Dao is called a "Daoist." What is a *shi* (士)? It is *li* (理, principle) and *shi* (事, affair). Body and mind follow principle, adhering only to the Dao, taking the Dao as their affair—hence the title "Daoist."

The *Master’s Scripture on the Dignified Rituals of the Chamber of Instruction* states: The Perfected One said: If a scholar can cast off worldly burdens and aspire to wander among mountains and waters, upholding the Wheel of the Supreme Dharma, they are called a *Master*, ever seated upon a high dais reciting scriptures, teaching and transforming the foolish and the wise, opening the path for all learners. If further possessed of pure perfection and utmost virtue, able to penetrate the mysteries of the abstruse, their disciples and fellow students may address them as "Master So-and-So." Those who plumb the depths and reach the far, whose talent and learning are profoundly mysterious, whose aspirations lie in the Great Vehicle—these may be called *Master of Mystic Stillness*, or *Master of Wandering the Mysteries*, or *Master of Distant Wandering*, or *Master of Proclaiming the Dao*, or *Master of Expounding the Mysteries*. To list them all would be inexhaustible; when the world has such persons, they are called *Master Daoists*.

The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: The Immortal Duke again knelt before the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate and said: "I sincerely beseech the Master to bestow the grace of the dharma, to moisten the withered and parched, that future Daoists may cultivate utmost perfection and abandon perverse arts."

The *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Distribution* states: The Supreme Perfection Lord of the Great Dao received this scripture from the Master of Primordial Antiquity and transmitted it to the Immortal King of the Mystic Capital.

The *Scripture of the Seventy-Four Methods of Transfiguration of the Supreme Clarity* states: The Master of the Purple Palace can achieve immortality, serene and harmonious with heaven’s truth, contemplating deeply and guarding the spirit. Though he has lived three thousand years, he has not yet ascended to heaven, lingering in the cavern chamber to select and await the perfected.

The *Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Transfiguration of Mount Tortoise’s Primordial Record* states: The Venerable Master of the Myriad Beginnings bears a form inscribed with ninety million patterns. In the three winter months, his head is crowned with a diadem of cinnabar sunlight, he wears a robe of red cloud luminous brocade, girded with a sash of golden tiger and phoenix patterns, and a purple seal of the cinnabar emperor. Ever riding white clouds, seated upon a five-colored lion, his radiance flows and shines, illuminating Supreme Clarity. In the three spring months, he transforms into a three-headed phoenix, clad in a nine-colored tiger robe of mottled patterns, ever standing upon twelve luminous flowers. In the three summer months, he shifts into the radiance of three suns, eight rays of purple light blazing and resplendent, above Supreme Clarity amidst twelve-colored lotuses. In the three autumn months, he assumes the form of intertwining lights of azure, red, and purple, coiling like the sun’s wheel.

The *Scripture of the Purple Dawn of Supreme Clarity* states: The Venerable Master of the Supreme Sovereign, the Purple Dawn Lord, is the offspring of the Two Radiant Ones, born of the essence of Jade Dawn within the Dragon Mist of the Great Void. Enveloping the Purple Emptiness to commune with the numinous, entrusting the Nine Mysteries to contain his brilliance, he congealed the vast dew to form his spirit. Refining the Three Qi to contemplate himself, passing through the Mystic Mother to be dharma-born, he endured kalpas of transformation, moved by auspicious days to manifest his form. Thus, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, the Heavenly Stem Jia inaugurated the dawn, and he was born in the Heaven of Eight Clarities of the Divine Continent, in the central domain of the Level Mound, by the shore of the Abyssal Cavern. At birth, his face shone with golden countenance, his body radiated jade light, adorned with five-colored purple patterns, capable of seventy-two transformations. His jade-like visage was refined, divine dragons spat mushrooms to bathe him, simurghs and phoenixes spread their wings to shade the mysterious. Cinnabar clouds scattered their splendor upon his jasper pavilion, flowing light blazed upon the radiant perfected. The Two Radiant Ones paused their brilliance in the Eight Mysteries, the Seven Primes revolved their essence to assist the dawn. Golden immortals scattered incense to mingle with the qi, divine consorts cast flowers to emit mist. The Five Wefts wove their patterns into the numinous splendor of the Purple Heaven. At the age of eighteen, he roamed the Middle Prime, ingesting essence and swallowing qi, exhaling and inhaling numinous fluids, containing mushrooms to inwardly irrigate, congealing his spirit into an embryonic immortal. Drawing in and rinsing, guarding silence, serene and natural, his thoughts subtle and his qi unceasing, he accumulated resonance with the Cavern Prime. His name transcended Supreme Clarity, he received the title of Primordial Sovereign, and ascended to the Purple Dawn. Orchid winds responded to his emergence, following the flow of destiny. His spirit held the Five Luminaries, his form encompassed the Three Primes. Soaring through the empyrean, his chariot returned through mist, the multitude of immortals opened the path where three ways converged in brightness. Lightning flashed forth its might, his swift chariot traversed the Nine Mysteries. Twice he ascended the jade steps, thrice he paid homage in the Purple Court, gazing upon the jasper towers, feasting in the splendor of the Three Primes, forging bonds with the Five Elders. A guest of the Jade Empyrean, flying beasts raised their sleeves, divine phoenixes sang in accompaniment, mighty dragons guided his reins, spirit winds scattered incense, wafting fragrance in surging waves. The jade purity of the Supreme Clarity flourished, golden lads grasped the clouds to attend his wheels, jade maidens trod the void to guard his spirit.

The *Scripture of the Ink Records of the Supreme Cinnabar Tablets* states: Should one receive the dharma rank of Perfected Unity or the title of the Primordial One’s Unadorned Contract, one may be designated as a "Master." Those born under the eastern constellations shall be titled "Master of the Eastern Marchmount"; those born under the southern constellations, "Master of the Southern Marchmount"; those born under the western constellations, "Master of the Western Marchmount"; those born under the northern constellations, "Master of the Northern Tree"; and those born under the central seven constellations—Chen, Xu, Chou, Wei, and the Center—shall be titled "Master of the Central Marchmount." These Five Marchmount Masters first enter the Earthly Registers, possessing the virtue worthy of such designation. Without numinous resonance and spiritual response, one cannot be so titled without merit.

The *Inner Transmission of the Supreme Perfected* states: When one’s name enters the Supreme Mysterious Register, the demonic gods of the Three Realms and the spirits of the departed all revere them, calling them "Celestial Superior." Daoists should always remain humble, for no attainment surpasses this in purity and nobility. These are the oral instructions of Master Yin, transmitted to teach the worthy and sagely of the world.

The *Scripture of the Difficulties Among the Sages* records: The Immortal asked the Immortal Duke, "Previously, when you and the Superior entered Dongting to view the Heavenly King’s detached palace, upon first ascending Baoshan, we saw a group of immortals seeking to follow the Superior to observe the spectacle. What manner of immortals were they, that there were so many?" The Duke replied, "Those immortals are all from the grotto-chambers of the famous mountains. Yet they are not numerous—have you not seen the countless immortals of Kunlun, Penglai, Zhongshan, Songgao, Sumeru, and Lingwu, among the great mountain grotto-chambers?"

The *Scripture of the Immortal Duke’s Inquiries* states: The Demon King submits to the Supreme Perfected, the Celestial Worthies, and the Heavenly Superior.

The *Scripture of the Supreme Jade Pivot of the Grand Empyrean* states: The Superior and the wondrous adept harmonize their light with the dust, blunting sharpness and resolving strife. Though they dwell among the common, their secrets differ. They bear the registers and taboo names, inhaling primordial essence, establishing virtue and merit—beyond the ken of the ordinary.

The *Supreme Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Numinous Treasure* states: The devoted scholar who recites the scripture ten times delivers those on the verge of death, reviving the perishing.

The *Scripture of the Dharma Wheel* states: I observe that the devoted scholar does not embrace worldly attachments.

The *Scripture of the Eightfold Simplicity of the Perfected* states: The numinous writ is solemn and weighty—one dare not hoard it, nor dare one transmit it lightly. If bound by yearly limits, eons may pass, and for the devoted scholar, the opportunity may never arise, leaving only sighs of thwarted aspiration. Though diligent, they achieve nothing, for the Primordial Beginning’s revelation is rarely met. Only when encounter aligns with the profound statutes of the Mysterious Code is it fitting to bestow.

The *Poor Daoist* in the *Instructions on the Numinous Unity of the Numinous Treasure* states: Those who seek the Dao of immortality must accumulate merit without limit, for when merit is complete, the Dao is naturally attained. The pursuit of the Dao is like a worldly person’s worry over poverty—none who persist fail to attain immortality. Thus, the Poor Daoist strives ceaselessly, devoted solely to the Dao, ever contending with the heart to subdue the illusions of demonic splendor. The term "Poor Daoist" is a general appellation for Shangqing Daoists.

The *Scripture of Resolute Will* records: A southern mountain Daoist answered Le Fa Xie, saying, "Last night, after descending from the lecture, I dreamed a man presented me with a true treasure—a ruyi scepter—and gave it to you. You accepted it, and I pondered, deeming it an auspicious omen."

The *Scripture of the Supreme Jade Pivot of the Grand Empyrean* states: Daoists, in humble acknowledgment of their incomplete mastery of the Dao, call themselves "Poor Daoists," or "Poor Scholars." Their understanding is not yet complete, and they feel as though something is lacking—hence the name "Poor Scholar." The scholar’s duty is to cultivate goodness as their vocation.

The *Master* in the *Scripture of the Great Precepts of Original Vows* records: The Supreme Ultimate Perfected answered the High Mystery Perfected, saying, "I am unworthy of the teaching and transformation, ashamed to be counted among the great masters." Here, "Master" refers to the Venerable Lord Ge. The Supreme has commanded—how dare I not pour forth all I possess?

The *Scripture of the Supreme Perfected’s Codes* states: The sagely master, moved by compassion, elucidates the scriptural codes, verifying them through precedent, resolving doubts and dispelling confusion, rectifying the perverse and aiding the upright, so that black and white are clearly distinguished.

The *Scripture of the Mysterious Teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi* states: Among virtues, there are those who know and those who do not. The Dao exalts the latter. The inferior all claim knowledge as true knowledge, imitating one another in the world, yet none recognize that true knowing lies in not-knowing. This is the profound mastery of the Mysterious Artisan, ever abiding in unknowing.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* states: The bond between master and disciple is of immense weight, akin to that of parent and child—one cannot shirk or sever it. Those who are born and do not serve a worthy master, or who serve a foolish one, are taught evil and led into depravity, causing others to perish in body and soul. Their remaining sins may even consume their entire household. Some are born without seeking learning and thus become fools. The ignorant suffer alone, and in the underworld, their souls find no joy. Upon death, they do not become benevolent spirits. Now, the worthy master teaches people, transforming the most foolish into good; if goodness does not cease, they become virtuous; if virtue does not cease, they attain sageliness; if sageliness does not cease, they comprehend the true Dao; if they guard the Dao without ceasing, they become immortal and deathless; if immortality does not cease, they attain perfection; if perfection does not cease, they become divine; if divinity does not cease, they equal Heaven; if equality with Heaven does not cease, they equal the Primordial Qi; when they equal the Primordial Qi, they envelop Heaven and Earth, and the eight directions all receive their qi to live. Their virtue then blankets Heaven and Earth and the eight directions. Their spirit merges with Heaven and Earth, and all under Heaven partake of their sustenance, offering sacrifices in awe, fearing they cannot fully honor them. Such is the merit of the most worthy master and the good disciple.

It is further said: As a disciple, one should be reverent and attentive from dawn to dusk, following the master’s teachings without the slightest deviation. One must not speak recklessly to disrupt the master’s goings and comings, nor cause the master worry. From the moment one receives instruction, one must not transgress, utter no harsh words, and never oppose the master’s will—such is the most excellent disciple.

Master Yi Zhen’s words approach this standard, yet they do not qualify as the most excellent disciple, but only as a middling one. Nevertheless, the most excellent disciple, after receiving the master’s teachings, bears in mind the master’s grace, thereby attaining full personhood. They then accompany worthy immortals without fail, never straying from their ranks. Some may obtain official positions to repay their parents, while others may delve deeply into the Dao, mastering the art of self-nourishment.

Having been born of parents, perfected their virtue through the master, and honored their lord with glory, when dwelling alone, they reflect upon the aging of their lord, father, and master, realizing there is nothing with which to repay them. They constantly yearn to obtain rare methods and extraordinary texts to requite their master’s merit, and in their remorse, their hearts ache with sorrow. Thus, they further study and serve the worthy, entrusting their master to them, speaking on their behalf, enabling the master to become a fine minister to the state and benefit the ruler’s governance—such is the good disciple of ancient times.

The *Scripture of the Great Precepts of the Numinous Treasure* states: "Receive my Ten Precepts, practice the Twelve Permissibles, and by adhering to them, become a pure and faithful disciple of the Great Dao. In this present life, you may be freed from sorrow and distress, cross over all suffering, enter into radiant light, and purify your form within. You may summon ghosts and command spirits, subduing demonic forces."

It further says: "Those who have not yet attained the Dao but can fly through the heavens are the ten-turn disciples of the Dao. They soar through the void, driving the chariots of the various heavens. After ten turns, they may ascend to become flying immortals. If, in their first turn, they practice with diligence, their hearts unwavering, performing meritorious deeds, observing strict fasts and austerities from dawn to dusk without fatigue, they may attain the rank of flying immortal. From this, they may advance further, transcending the Three Realms to become Perfected Ones of the Upper Clarity."

The *True Scripture of the Eightfold Simplicity* states: "Those who follow the Three Luminaries and are called disciples of the Three Realms, having delivered three persons and entrusted them to their master and friends, may thereafter transmit the teachings and be called Masters of the Three Luminaries, Preceptors, and Perfected Ones, as designated by their master and recommended by their peers. Without having undergone formal petition and approval, they may not presumptuously claim such titles."

**Release by Means of the Corpse**
The *Scripture of the Chapters on the Generation of Spirits in the Nine Heavens* states: "Those who study the supreme Dao and aspire to immortality, having attained release by means of the corpse, pass through transformation and transference, ultimately returning to the immortal Dao. Their form and spirit unite, never parting, and together they enter the perfection of the Dao."

The *Scripture of the Regulations of the Illuminated Perfected* states: "Those born in the world who love learning, cultivate the scriptural teachings, ingest essence and swallow qi without ceasing, observe fasts and regulate their diet, refine themselves through breath control, accumulate merit and spread virtue—whose names are recorded in the Upper Clarity—may attain release by means of the corpse as lesser immortals, roaming the Five Marchmounts. Later, reborn among humans, they receive the scriptures and methods anew, becoming masters and exemplars. When their Dao is complete through cyclic cultivation, they attain the rank of superior immortals, ascending in broad daylight to positions of high nobility."

The *Scripture of the Golden Tablet and Jade Characters of the Grand Tenuity* states: "All those who preside over the subterranean realms of release by means of the corpse, according to the statutes of the Four Poles of the Perfected, must wait one hundred and forty years before being appointed to immortal offices. Only then may they ascend with flowered canopies, riding a host of dragons, to the Grand Ultimate and wander the Nine Palaces."

The *Upper Scripture of the Flying Immortal’s Precious Sword* states: "Release by means of the corpse is the transformation of the corporeal form, the refinement and shedding of the original true self, the wandering change of the bodily frame, the hidden departure of the five constituents. Though it ranks among the lower grades of immortality, the endowment and transmission one receives are not necessarily slight. Some may not yet wish to ascend to heaven but prefer to dwell in famous mountains; others may wish to exalt the teachings of the world, severing the path of life and death, cutting off the attachments of descendants, and making the pursuit of immortality their ultimate aspiration. Some may wish to observe the transformations of the world for long ages, dreading the toil of immortal offices. Once the wondrous Dao is complete, their rank and position are fitting, and one cannot use the clarity of life and death to fix their definitive status. These are what are called those who conceal the three luminaries and cause the sun to sink into the land."

It further states: "By applying the Elixir of the Recorded Form to fire and charcoal, others will see one’s form burned to death—this is called *fire release by means of the corpse*. By taking one pill with water, embracing a tree and lying down, others will see one wounded to death in an empty chamber—this is called *weapon release by means of the corpse*. In all cases, one may freely return to one’s hometown, though one must change one’s name and alter one’s appearance. In the past, there was one who practiced this method, entered Mount Linlü for thirteen years, and then returned home.

Those who undergo the lesser release by means of the corpse may not look back upon their hometowns. This is the way of the superior release, and their names are matched to the Purple Tablets of the Three Offices. They may not again peer into the gaps of the world, falsely imposing death upon themselves. Some die and revive, some are decapitated and die only to emerge from another side, some die and their corpses vanish before encoffining, some retain their human form but are without bones, some leave their clothes behind while their form departs, and some lose their hair and vanish. Those who depart in broad daylight are called *superior release by means of the corpse*; those who depart at midnight are called *inferior release by means of the corpse*; and those who depart at dawn or dusk are called *subterranean presiders*.

Though their traces and signs do not vanish, arousing human suspicion, and though they attain concealment, the world’s records remain unsatisfied, they may not return to their hometowns, and their wanderings lack stability.

**Subterranean Presiders**
The *Upper Scripture of the Flying Immortal’s Precious Sword* states: "Those of utmost loyalty and filial piety, upon death, all receive records to become subterranean presiders. After one hundred and forty years, they may receive the teachings of lesser immortals, gradually advancing in the Great Dao to be appointed to immortal offices. Every one hundred and forty years, they are permitted one trial for promotion."

Those of utmost filial piety can move ghosts and spirits, causing the birds of the mountains and beasts of the wild to flee from their graves. Those of utmost loyalty possess a forthright and unyielding heart, their essence piercing the bright sun; some split open their bowels or sacrifice their lives to rouse their lords.

Those endowed with the virtue of the highest sages, upon death, all receive records from the Three Offices to become subterranean presiders. After one thousand years, they may be promoted to the Five Emperors of the Three Offices or become the Illustrious Lords of the East, West, South, or North, governing ghosts and spirits. After another one thousand four hundred years, they may roam the Grand Clarity and become Central Immortals of the Nine Palaces.

Those possessing transcendent talent, surpassing the multitudes in renown, who nurture their vast integrity and seek no glory or rank, upon death receive records from the Three Offices to become *shanshuang* ghosts. After four hundred years, they may become subterranean presiders, advancing thereafter in stages of three hundred years each.

Those of utmost integrity and purity, upon death, receive records from the Three Offices to become *qing* ghosts. After two hundred eighty years, they may become subterranean presiders, gradually advancing to immortal offices in stages of two hundred eighty years each. Those of utmost integrity consume no food not their own, nor wear cloth not their own. Those of utmost purity cannot be swayed by splendor from their upright *qi*, nor can the might of ten thousand chariots shake their moral resolve.

If one’s ancestors rendered service to the Three Offices, the merit extends to their descendants, who may undergo refinement and transformation across generations, changing their surnames and being reborn. This is the seven-generation hidden virtue, its roots passing down in succession. Upon death, they leave behind a foot bone to return to the Three Offices, while the rest of their bones ascend with the body. Men leave the left bone, women the right, and all receive records to become subterranean presiders. After two hundred eighty years, they may advance to receive the Way of Earthly Immortals.

On the day of their passing, their form appears as flesh of the living. At the moment of death, their corpse does not stiffen, their toes do not turn blue, and the skin of their hands does not wrinkle—these are signs of one who, by prior virtue and conduct, naturally attains *release by means of the corpse*.

*Treatise on the Daoist Canon, Scroll Three*

Slander

*The Hidden Writ of the Supreme Clarity’s Dragon Script* states: People are often false and shallow, failing to comprehend the ultimate principle. Their sins run deep, and their doubts obscure what is true and correct. Should they chance to hear subtle wonders, they respond with slander, treating them with disdain and disbelief, thereby falling into evil destinies. There, they endure the torments of wind and blade, suffering without respite across kalpas.

*The Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: The Most High said: Those who slander this scripture shall, upon death, enter hell, endure the Three Offices’ interrogations, and in this life suffer from leprosy.

It further states: Dou Ziming said: The people of this world are deluded, driven by greed and self-indulgence. They fail to recognize the ultimate truth, resorting to flattery, deceit, and malice. Some envy the worthy and resent the capable, slandering and defaming one another. Others engage in lustful disputes, secretly cursing and harming others. Some rely on strength and power to bully the weak. Some insist on their own rightness while dismissing others. Some perform minor good deeds but, after mere days or months without sincere devotion, demand immediate results. When their desires go unmet, they dismiss the teachings of past lives and karma, claiming there is no retribution. This is like a farmer planting grain—spring planting yields autumn harvest. To sow and then demand immediate cooking would be to starve. Cultivating blessings and performing good deeds is the same: blessings accumulate into fortune, while misdeeds accumulate into calamity. This is as clear as daylight, yet people refuse to believe—how lamentable!

Defamation

*The Statutes of Illuminating Perfection* states: In the boundless world, men and women who live in defiance of the Dao criticize and defame the celestial perfected, disbelieve in scriptures and precepts, speak falsely while harboring deceit, and secretly plot evil. Their sins are grave, and upon death, they endure bitter torments. Even if they return to the human realm, they are reborn among border barbarians, no longer of the human kind, destined to suffer the consequences of a hundred evils in repayment for past transgressions. Forever severed from the human path, they have no return, drifting endlessly through the gates of sin, their births and deaths unknown.

Assault

*The Statutes of Illuminating Perfection* states: In the boundless world, men and women who, in their conduct, scrutinize and attack the four ranks of beings, assaulting celestial immortals, shall upon death endure cruel retribution, forever mired in evil roots.

*The Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: The Dao says: Those who, in their allotted lifespan, reject scriptural teachings, disparage divine immortals, indulge their reckless impulses, kill and punish beyond measure, curse heaven and earth, and attack perfected beings—such deeds are reported by the hosts of the Mysterious Bureau to the vast heavens. I shall then command the Director of Destinies to consign them to Fengdu, cutting short their predetermined lifespan. If they persist in their ways without repentance, their lineage will be severed, and ancestral sacrifices will cease.

*The Scripture of the Dharma Wheel* states: The Dao says: I have surveyed the heavens and seen that among the people of this world, men and women who uproot their foundations, attack their superiors, slander and strike the worthy, flatter and harm the loyal, and take lives—such souls cry out endlessly in death. Their sins are grave, and they incur present retributions of manifold suffering, enduring through ten thousand kalpas. They shall be reborn in barbarian lands, possessing human form but lacking human nature.

Indulgence in Wine

*The Most High’s Scripture on Wisdom and Dispelling Demons* states: The Most High said: Wine is the essence of grains and water, capable of circulating qi and fluids. In moderation, it aids the spirit and benefits nature; in excess, it disrupts the spirit and harms life. To indulge to the point of death is not the way of wisdom.

*The Scripture of Alliance and Might* states: The Most High said: The talented and wise are obsessed with wine, their faces flushed and minds clouded, their natures inverted. They destroy the ten virtues and foster the ten evils, blocking the four directions and obstructing the six penetrations. They must swiftly abandon it.

*The Scripture of Lord Lao’s Statutes and Decrees* states: The noble drink wine to celebrate; the base drink to provoke strife. There are twenty-four matters clearly outlined—those who uphold goodness must observe them. To violate even one is to fail as a disciple.

1. When drunk, subjects disrespect their lords, and lords may grow arrogant and violent. Wives defy their husbands, and children disobey their fathers.
2. Drunkenness leads to the loss of virtue, and wanton behavior knows no bounds.
3. When drunk, words flow recklessly, speech becomes insolent, and respect for hierarchy vanishes.
4. When drunk, one cannot sit still, swaying and stumbling.
5. When drunk, one soils the bed with vomit and filth.
6. When drunk, one loses all fear, imagining they can strike a tiger or leap into fire or water.
7. When drunk, one reveals others’ private affairs.
8. When drunk, one speaks carelessly, without restraint or fear.
9. When drunk, one lies like the dead, utterly senseless.
10. When drunk and returning home, even family flees, fearing them as they would a tiger or bandit.
11. Drunkenness may cause illness, leaving the face sallow and yellow.
12. When drunk, one may lie alone on the road, losing all possessions.
13. Drunkenness leads to squandering family wealth on wine, resulting in poverty.
14. When drunk, one may curse the gods, tear off clothes, and run wildly, fighting with anyone encountered.
15. When drunk, one may steal without regard for kinship.
16. When drunk, one fails to distinguish good from evil.
17. When drunk, one may destroy household items.
18. When drunk, one neglects family affairs and forgets wife and children.
19. When drunk, one neglects official duties, leading to demotion.
20. Drunkenness may bring disaster, or in the case of generals, lead to military defeat.
21. When drunk, one may fall from a horse, injuring the face.
22. When drunk, one becomes confused, neglecting work, fields, and silkworms.
23. Prolonged drunkenness rots the intestines and stomach, harming life.
24. Drunkenness harms the spirit, disrupts qi, damages virtue, and corrupts the true nature. Beware of it!

*The Statutes of Illuminating Perfection* states: In the boundless world, men and women who, in their conduct, indulge in wine and lust, lose their nature in confusion and madness, their five emotions in chaos, their spirits scattered, and their qi depleted. Drunkenness leads to desire, and they commit evil unknowingly, shouting curses, acting alone without restraint, striking the good, defiling and disrespecting the Dao and its teachings, slandering scriptures, turning from truth to falsehood, breaking promises, deceiving the four ranks of beings, and straying from the Way. Their sins are deeply perverse. Upon death, they endure severe retribution, their souls suffering intensely, dragged through the dark waves of the Four Rivers, condemned to labor in the Yangtze and Yellow River, toiling day and night without rest. Shackled in iron chains, they are dragged endlessly through the eternal night, never to escape across ten thousand kalpas. They shall be reborn among the lowly, poor, and diseased, despised by all in repayment for past enmity. The path of blessings grows ever distant, while the roots of sin entangle deeper, leaving no way to liberation or escape.

The *Hymn of the Flying Celestials* states:
Loving wine, they lose their fundamental conduct,
The Five Spirits all run wild in madness.
Upon death, they draw the dark waves’ water,
To pour and drench the Four Rivers’ depths.

The *Sutra of Retribution for Womb-Dwelling Karma* says:
There are those who superficially honor the Three Treasures,
Their faith unsteady, indulging in wanton dissipation,
Mired in lust and desire, they falsely invoke scriptures
To seek fame and profit, gathering crowds
And mingling in wrongdoing.
Such people, upon death, face severe trials in the Three Evil Realms,
Forever without release.

The *Scripture of the Great Precepts of the Numinous Treasure* says:
The Heavenly Worthy declares: Beware the unrestrained gaze of lust,
For the spirit of the eyes, unchecked, clings to desire.
Steady the pupils, contemplate true stillness,
That wisdom may flow and the void be perceived.

**Lack of Compassion**
The *Scripture of Illuminating Truth* states:
In the boundless world, men and women in life
Act without kindness or benevolence,
Boiling and slaughtering the six livestock,
Carving and maiming, cutting short beasts’ lives,
Poisoning and butchering sentient beings.
Their sins are deeply perverse; upon death, they endure cruel retribution—
Swallowing fire, eating coals, burned by flames,
Their faces scorched, their bodies rotting,
No longer human in form.
They bear iron staves, wear mountains of fire,
Pain beyond endurance, torment beyond bearing,
No liberation possible—how may they return?

The *Lament of the Flying Celestials* says:
Failing to cherish a heart of compassion,
Cruelly harming living beings,
Their souls, in death, bear iron staves,
For ten thousand kalpas wear mountains of fire.

**Lack of Filial Piety**
The *Scripture of Illuminating Truth* states:
In the boundless world, men and women in life
Are unfilial, cursing and humiliating parents,
Relatives turning against one another.
Their sins are deeply perverse; upon death, they endure cruel retribution.
For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn among the six livestock,
At the mercy of others’ slaughter, repaying past enmity.
Forever losing the human path, they sink into evil roots.

**The Three Obstructions**
The *Sutra of the Primordial Lord’s Wisdom and Right Contemplation for Liberation* states:
The Dao Lord should know that from the Three Poisons arise the Three Obstructions.
First, afflictions.
Second, karmic deeds.
Third, retribution.
Due to these Three Obstructions, practitioners cannot attain true cultivation of right contemplation.
Afflictions refer to love and delusion constantly dwelling in the heart,
Preventing the arising of right understanding.
Laboring in attachment is called the obstruction of afflictions.
The obstruction of karma arises from desiring to perform good deeds,
While evil deeds weigh heavily, inevitably yielding worldly fruits of suffering and joy.
One cannot cultivate practices that transcend the world,
Thus blocking right wisdom—this is called the obstruction of karma.
The obstruction of retribution means rebirth in the Three Evil Realms,
Where suffering torments the body, leaving no means to cultivate precepts and wisdom.
Those in the heavens and among humans cling to pleasure,
Failing to awaken to impermanence.
Desire veils them, never ceasing day or night.
Poverty, distress, and illness—all conditions unmet—
Prevent the cultivation of the right path to transcend the world.
This is called the obstruction of retribution.
Those of wisdom, recognizing this,
Should skillfully transform these obstructive dharmas.

**The Three Fears**
The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states:
The Most High said: Dao Ling, know that in the latter age, the people have three things to fear. Examine them well.
First, jealousy of the Dao and its teachings is to be feared.
Second, slander is to be feared.
Third, greed and desire are to be feared.
Jealousy of the Dao and its teachings prevents the scriptures from spreading.
Slandering Dharma masters causes the people’s faith to waver.
Greed for wealth and sensuality makes one despised.
Of these three, two lie without, one within.
Only by removing these three afflictions can the Dao be transmitted.
Encourage and uphold its study.
The Most High then composed a song:
Jealousy of those better than oneself,
Slander of the wise and enlightened,
Greed and lust for wealth and sensuality—
These prevent the transmission of my scriptures.
While these three afflictions remain,
How can one hope for the unseen realms?
False conduct seeks profit and sustenance,
Never possessing true sincerity.
Seeing others honor virtue,
The heart clings to malice.
Such people are detested by spirits,
In life, they earn a foul name.
Upon death, they descend to the dark realms,
Suffering trials in the ghostly prisons.
Through countless kalpas, they revolve in the wheel,
Enduring countless forms of punishment.

**The Three Poisons**
The *Sutra of the Primordial Lord’s Wisdom and Right Contemplation for Liberation* states:
The Most High Dao Lord addressed the Heavenly Worthy:
What are the characteristics of afflictions?
The Heavenly Worthy replied: Afflictions are collectively called the Three Poisons—greed, hatred, and delusion.
They harm the Dharma-body and life of sentient beings, hence they are called poisons.
Greed means insatiable grasping,
Clinging to desire and attachment without end.
Seeking pleasure in worldly and transcendent dharmas—
All this is called greed.
Hatred means harboring resentment and rage toward sentient beings and non-sentient things,
Fierce anger blazing like fire,
Burning away good roots, binding deep enmity—
This is called hatred.
Delusion means lacking faith in and understanding of the Three Treasures and the true Dharma,
Arrogant, deceitful, and crooked, knowing nothing,
Bumping into walls without foundation,
Refusing admonition, delighting in useless speech,
Committing many evil deeds, straying from the Way—
This is called ignorance.

**The Four Afflictions**
The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states:
The Most High said: Dao Ling, know that people of the world have four unwholesome dharmas, most difficult to remove—the gravest illnesses of the Dao. You should recognize them. What are the four?
First, worldly people do not seek the guidance of those with the Dao, and they are ashamed to ask their inferiors.
Second, though they have practiced the Dao for a long time, their knowledge and insight remain shallow. Seeing those superior to themselves, they are ashamed to learn further.

Third, claiming vast learning, they refuse to heed other scriptures.
Fourth, they belittle later learners, saying they know nothing.
Such four kinds of people, though they study the Dao, labor in vain!
They cannot attain the Dao, nor achieve any penetration—no spiritual verification comes to them. Why toil in vain?
From the outset, such people seek the Dao without wholehearted sincerity, desiring only fame and offerings.
Ever devouring fire and poison as food, they take others’ wealth for clothing—like swords and spears piercing their bodies.
Coveting immediate gain, they know not the profound calamities awaiting them in later lives.
Upon death, they enter hell, where molten iron and boiling bronze are poured into their mouths, and iron needles and thorns are fashioned into garments to clothe their bodies.
Beaten and flogged without respite, day and night, for countless kalpas, they may at last be reborn as humans—only to dwell in lowly stations, as slaves, servants, soldiers, or menial laborers.
Though the worthies teach and expound the scriptures, they are barred from hearing them. Even if they wish to learn anew, they cannot act freely.
Even now, I see before me such multitudes—beyond counting—most pitiable indeed!
Let the enlightened teachings be passed on to come: be vigilant! Be vigilant!

The Five Desires
The *Scriptural Teachings of Lord Lao* states: Greed and desire are boundless. From these boundless desires, thoughts arise in endless succession, beyond all reckoning. In broad terms, there are five:

First, the eyes crave the sight of the five colors—when colors exceed measure, the *hun*-soul is wearied.
Second, the ears crave the sound of the five tones—when tones grow clamorous, the *po*-soul suffers.
Third, the nose craves the scent of the five fragrances—when fragrances overflow, essence flows away.
Fourth, the mouth craves the sweetness of the five flavors—when flavors abound, the spirit grows turbid.
Fifth, the body craves indulgence in the five limbs—when the limbs grow sluggish, the will scatters.

When the will scatters, the spleen is harmed, and conduct becomes perilous.
When the spirit grows turbid, the heart is disordered, and the mouth errs.
When essence flows away, the kidneys are depleted, and madness ensues.
When the *po*-soul suffers, the lungs are damaged, and the ears grow deaf.
When the *hun*-soul is wearied, the liver is afflicted, and the eyes dim.

When these five are muddled and obscured, the body perishes and life ends.
When these five are pure, the body remains whole and years endure.

The Five Turbidities
Now an explanation: First, the turbidity of life; second, the turbidity of views; third, the turbidity of affliction; fourth, the turbidity of birth; fifth, the turbidity of the age.

The *Scripture of the Jade Key of Numinous Treasure* states: The Supreme Dao Lord addressed Wang Longci, a diligent scholar of the Dao, saying: "I received the ancient scriptures from the Primordial Beginning Perfected One. I expound the present by citing the past, and verify the present by invoking the past—this is deeply trustworthy. After ten thousand kalpas, the Dao will return to the Supreme Wanning-Li Heaven. Thereafter, in the midst of the Five Turbidities, I now explain their time and place.

To encounter misfortune in life—this is the turbidity of life. Not only are the years few and life cut short, but past karma is also impure. Whether man or woman, they do not behold the scriptural teachings and constantly dwell in evil destinies.

This is the turbidity of views: perverse views cloud the heart, and the true principle is not believed. The sin of slandering the Dharma is grave, and one lingers long in hell. Life is brief, yet sorrow and affliction cling to oneself. One suffers many unjust hardships—this is the turbidity of affliction. Greed, wrath, and delusion may give rise to fear and dread, entangling those who cultivate the Dao.

Born only to die, one revolves through the five paths, falling into the three wretched destinies and the eight difficulties—this is the turbidity of birth. Submitting to fate’s rise and fall, one revolves through suffering and hardship, obstructed from the true Dao. Karmic retribution drags one endlessly. In life and death, there is separation; no one, high or low, escapes—this is the turbidity of the age. As the great kalpa nears its end, all evil fruits ripen, and suffering is universally endured. Truly, this is grievous to the heart.

Now I explain these evils to deliver those who can be delivered. You must rectify your intent and attentively receive my words." Thereupon, the commentary was written.

Longci bowed his head and reverently received the teachings. Now, the Supreme One, moved by compassion, transmitted the scriptural key so that the obstructions of the Five Turbidities might dissolve, preserving the fortune of Great Peace.

The *Scripture of Bright Perfection’s Regulations* states: People of future ages, not beholding the regulations and precepts, will tread the poisonous broth of the Five Turbidities, encounter calamities and harm, and be unable to deliver themselves.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Book for Delivering Life* states: The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy said: "After my passing, the true scriptures will be hidden away. The kalpa will grow short, the Five Turbidities will stir in contention, and myriad evils will converge. How lamentable that those born into such an age willingly tread the path of sin, revolving through the five paths, enduring the long suffering of the eight difficulties, harming one another, affliction clinging to the body. They do not behold the scriptures and do not encounter sacred texts, submitting to the rise and fall of fate in life and death. How pitiful indeed!"

The Seven Harms
The *Scripture of the Nine Heavens for Turning Back to Heaven* states: The August Emperor of Highest Sagacity said: "Among those who study the Dao and have their names recorded in the mysterious registers, whose bodies bear the marks of immortality, there are those who naturally align with the Perfected—yet they suffer the Seven Harms that lead to defeat.

The first harm: donning the true while practicing the false, indulging in lust and dissipating the spirit. The *hun*-soul’s fluids leak away, the radiance of essence withers, qi scatters, the *po*-soul scatters, the bones hollow, the form decays, the spirit weeps in the exhausted palace. This is heard in the Celestial Pass, the Perfected Immortals flee far away, demonic spirits approach to trouble one. One binds oneself to the nine hells, befriends the Six Heavens, and sinks into boundless suffering. How can one still attain immortality?

The second harm: outwardly, the form preserves the Dao, the skin appears refined, and one professes devotion to the true, yet the heart harbors yin thieves. Malice and wickedness accumulate within, wishing others ill and failure, envying the capable and resenting the worthy. The mouth speaks fair words, but the heart is perverse; the face smiles, but the heart seethes. One disputes over gains and losses, recklessly creates the roots of sin, slanders fellow students, and attacks the foundation of the teacher. The Three Officials record this, marking one as an evil portal. The Perfected Immortals flee far away, while demonic spirits assail the body. One becomes a wandering shadow, the flying form scatters the spirit. Thus, one suffers unjust hardships, exhausting the roots of evil. When the reckoning is complete, the form turns to ash and sinks into oblivion. Though one bears a name in the mysterious registers, how can one preserve the natural?

The third harm: drinking wine to the point of utter intoxication, harming qi and losing the numinous. The five palaces collapse, the myriad spirits are startled, the *hun* and *po* scatter and fly away, the inner and outer decay and crumble. The original chamber is left empty and desolate, the Red Child wails in sorrow. The Perfected Immortals flee far away, while demonic spirits enter the form. Such a student vainly wastes essence and sincerity. Though one may have a name in the mysterious registers, it is but an empty loss of the jade name. The spirit ascends to the upper palace, while the body turns to ash in the dark underworld. In a state of confusion, seeking long life—how can one endure?

The fourth harm: conduct that does not benefit others, demanding reverence from others, the heart filled with anger, the mouth engaged in constant quarrels and curses. Joy and wrath lack moderation, the temperament is contrary and unsteady. Qi surges, the spirit scatters, the inner Perfected flees, the *po* departs, the *hun* vanishes, the nine orifices fill with dust, the five palaces rush to ruin. All this stems from the impure nature and the inauspicious conduct. The Perfected Immortals flee far away, while external ailments enter the form. With such a path of study, what can one hope for? Though one may possess the mysterious chart, one cannot escape this calamity. The day of attaining immortality grows distant, while the path to the underworld lengthens.

The fifth harm: though one may outwardly display the mysterious chart and receive precious scriptures, or encounter a numinous teacher who imparts sacred texts, one does not follow the regulations and covenants, leaking the celestial Perfected. Before completing nine years of submitting one’s name to the famous mountains, ensuring that the Azure Palace has a record and the Golden Portal compiles a register, one transmits these to others, scattering them among the world. To treat the true lightly and leak the precious brings reckoning upon oneself. Though one may bear a name in the mysterious registers, it only burdens the Seven Mysteries. The Dao of immortality flees far away, the body dies and descends to the dark springs, forever bearing the responsibility of ghosts, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas."

Sixth Harm: Treading through filth and defilement, body and shadow reek unpleasantly. Within, there is no purity or emptiness; without, no orchid’s fragrance. Turbid darkness loses the true, spirits do not dwell in their chambers. Qi is disturbed, essence confounded, the numinous origin loses its radiance. The Five Spirits scatter and flee, the Red Child soars away. Demonic forces assail, inner and outer both perish. In such study, hope for attainment brings only harm. The Perfected Immortals ascend far away, leaving but an empty shadow to wander alone, sinking into murk and chaos—how can immortality be hoped for?

Seventh Harm: Consuming the flesh of the six livestock, slaughtering to sate the palate with rich flavors. Foul vapors fill the viscera, cutting short life in forms not one’s own. True qi is disturbed at the numinous pass, the wandering spirit startles the Red Child. Hun and po depart from their palaces, turbid weeping clings to mouth and teeth. The Perfected Immortals ascend high to Jade Clarity, while one’s own body sinks and lingers in the earthly realm. Though bearing a name in the Emperor’s mysterious register, one still cannot escape inevitable death.

The Eight Difficulties
The *Lingbao Zhenyi Ziran Jingjue* states: The Dao says: For kings, lords, Daoist masters, and common folk to be born as humans, forsaking the female form to become male—this is difficult.
Having become male, possessing keen intelligence and far-reaching wisdom, the six emotions intact, form and appearance upright and majestic, voice like jade tones, qi like renowned incense, eyes radiant as sunlight, delighting all who behold—yet still feeling the mysterious as insufficient—this is difficult.
Having fulfilled all virtues, being born in a land of the Dao, where ruler and father are wise and deeply esteem the Way—this is difficult.
Being poor yet devoted to the Dao, unceasing in thoughts of kindness and generosity—this is difficult.
Being wealthy and noble yet believing in and revering Daoist masters, honoring and serving the scriptures without negligence—this is difficult.
Being able to endure others’ malice without contention, mastering life and preventing decay, attaining transcendence and the immortal Dao—this is difficult.
Encountering the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns—*Dongzhen*, *Dongxuan*, and *Dongshen*—and upholding, reciting, and making offerings to them with incense—this is difficult.
Meeting a Perfected Immortal or Sage who expounds the teachings, and finding like-minded companions—this is difficult.
These are the Eight Difficulties.

The *Zhongzhen Jie Jing* states: The Perfected Lord of the Western City declared: For one to depart the Three Evil Paths and be born as a human—this is difficult.
The commentary to this scripture explains: The Three Evil Paths mean not being born as a human, but as birds, beasts, insects, or livestock—these are the Three Evil Paths.
Having been born as a human, forsaking the female form to become male—this is difficult.
Having become male, possessing intact six emotions and four limbs—this is difficult.
With the six emotions intact, being born in the Central Kingdom—this is difficult.
Living in the Central Kingdom and encountering a ruler, parents, or sovereign who upholds the Dao—this is difficult.
Having encountered a sovereign who upholds the Dao, being born to study the Dao with a compassionate, benevolent, and virtuous heart—this is difficult.
With a virtuous heart awakened, believing in the Dao and the virtue of longevity—this is difficult.
Having believed in the Dao and virtue, being born in an era of Great Peace—this is most difficult.
How can one not be exhorted!

The Seven Perils
The *Ben Yuan Da Jie Jing* states: The Perfected One said: The peril lies in being born into the human realm yet failing to cultivate virtue and nurture one’s nature to preserve life.
The peril lies in hearing the scriptures yet failing to believe them.
The peril lies in receiving the scriptures yet failing to recite and expound them, or to practice their teachings.
The peril lies in failing to cultivate the body.
The peril lies in taking medicinal herbs yet growing weary before they take effect.
The peril lies in the Dao’s practices being incomplete yet boasting of seeking ascension.
The peril lies in retreating to secluded mountains to read scriptures in quietude yet being unable to endure the hardships.
These seven perils reside within the person. If one does not guard against them, the body cannot be saved. Thus it is said: The greatest peril befalls my own self—this is what it means.
How can one not reflect! How can one not reflect!

The Five Corruptions

The *Scripture of the Purple Texts of the Numinous Book* states:

**First Corruption:** When a person indulges in licentiousness, ghostly fluids leak outward, essence and radiance wither and deplete, the hun and po scatter in scorched disarray, bones grow frail and marrow turns foul. The hun wails in the numinous palace, its cries ascending to the Jade Tower. The Three Palaces contend in turmoil, the embryonic flower grieves in confusion—this is the first corruption of the immortal’s appearance.

**Second Corruption:** Refrain from consuming the flesh of the six livestock, for it causes the body’s qi to stagnate and reek, the spirit to grow turbid and sluggish. The face turns sallow, the teeth wither, the spleen nurtures dead qi, the hun cannot receive the true, and the po breeds perverse rebellion. The body sinks into the abyss, bones buried in earth—this is the second corruption of the immortal’s appearance.

**Third Corruption:** Refrain from eating the five pungent vegetables, for they make the five viscera reek with foulness, the Three Flowers dissolve in chaos. The spirit cannot ascend, the essence-womb descends into ruin, the hun and po part ways, the Red Child grows restless and weary, the Flying Spirit loses its guard, and the luminous radiance scatters in flight—this is the third corruption of the immortal’s appearance.

**Fourth Corruption:** Refrain from killing living creatures, for above, it invites karmic retribution from the myriad beings. Blood flows from bound limbs, the form is exposed, the po perishes, the hun’s qi wages war, the embryonic spirit wanders in distress, the Infant flees in terror, the Mud Pill Palace turns treacherous and wild, the Red Child abandons and betrays. The corpse is cast into the boiling cauldron, boiled to a pulpy ruin—this is the fourth corruption of the immortal’s appearance.

**Fifth Corruption:** Do not relieve oneself facing north, nor gaze upward at the Three Luminaries. Do not cut hair or remove clothing facing north. Do not spit or curse facing north, lest you violate and destroy the King—"destroy" refers to the earthly branch of the year.

The *Scripture of the True Regulations of the Most High* states: The Most High Lord of the Dao said: Demon kings and perverse spirits are all demoted, and even if they are allowed to act again, they are still called "residual qi."

**Hunting**
The *Dao De Jing* of Lord Lao states: Galloping and hunting stir the heart to madness.

The *Scripture of Illuminating the True Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women born without the Dao, unmindful of good causes, hunt in the three spring months, unleashing hounds and falcons, setting snares and nets, burning mountains, stabbing and shooting wild beasts, slaughtering living beings. Their crimes are heinous and perverse; in death, they bear heavy calamities. Their bodies bear iron rods, myriad pains assail them, driven through a hundred realms, with no rest in eating or sleeping. The suffering of their dead souls is unbearable. For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn as wild beasts, constantly burned and hacked to repay past enmities. Even if they return to the human realm, they are always met by evil people, their bodies enduring whippings and beatings, afflicted by sorrow and distress. The path of blessing grows ever distant, entanglements deepen day by day. They cannot attain liberation, bound in eternal night.

The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: Master Dao Ling’s verse says:
*Those who do not cultivate a compassionate heart,*
*But hunt and kill living beings,*
*Will ultimately face karmic retribution—*
*Flames will scorch their forms.*

**Fishing and Trapping**
The *Scripture of the Original Beginning’s Wisdom, Right Contemplation, and Liberation* states: The Heavenly Worthy said: Some are reborn to make fishing and trapping their livelihood, damming rivers and breaching channels, casting nets and dangling lines, employing every means to harm aquatic life. They boil, roast, butcher, and mince, seeking to sate their bodies, or peddle their catch for profit. Such people, upon death, enter hell, where they receive retribution according to their deeds—enduring cauldrons, knife mountains, and sword trees, facing all manner of suffering. They are reborn as beasts to repay past debts. If they regain human form, their lives are short and fraught with afflictions. Those who personally kill, instruct others to kill, or purchase life with money—if their hearts rejoice in it, it is called killing, and the sin is no different.

**Cruelty**
The *Scripture of Illuminating the True Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women born into the world act with malice as their first impulse, inflicting boundless cruelty, slandering the loyal and good. In death, they face evil retribution, reborn with ox heads and beastly bodies, tormented day and night with unspeakable agony. Their bodies rot and disintegrate, losing all human form. For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn in the frontier lands, possessing human shape but not human nature, forever cut off from the human realm, eternally mired in the gates of sin. They drift through the Five Sufferings and Eight Adversities, unable to attain liberation, bound for countless kalpas without return.

The *Verses of the Flying Celestials* say:
*Those who cruelly harm the loyal and good,*
*Slander and strike the worthy,*
*Are born in frontier lands in life,*
*And in death, take the forms of oxen and beasts.*

**Licentious Sacrifices**
The *Scripture of the Orthodox Unity True Person’s Exposition of the Thousand Illuminations* states: Sacrificing to spirits not one’s own is called licentious sacrifice, which ensnares one in a host of perverse forces.

The *Scripture of the Most High’s True Regulations* states: The Most High Lord of the Dao said: Demon kings and hideous spirits are all demoted, and even if they are allowed to act again, they are still called "residual qi." Residual qi brings disaster, harming the multitudes. The multitudes, failing to awaken, join their ranks, slaughtering living beings and drumming in dance. They chant and sing in sacrifice, terrifying one another, craving the scent of blood and flesh, their offerings strewn in chaos. Their sins accumulate day by day.

The *Scripture of Illuminating the True Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women born into the world act with malice and perversity. They slaughter living beings in licentious sacrifices, praying to perverse spirits, singing and dancing in demonic revelry, calling themselves "aunt" and "lord," devouring the common folk, building without reason. Their filth fills and their sins are fixed. In death, they face evil retribution, their hun and po imprisoned, drifting through the Three Offices and Five Peaks, tormented thrice daily with unspeakable agony. For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn among the lowly, or afflicted with the Six Extremes, taking inhuman forms. They sink into the abyss of sin, bound in eternal night, unable to attain liberation, with no affinity for the path of blessing.

The *Verses of the Flying Celestials* say:
*Those who curse the innocent,*
*Dance in licentious sacrifice to perverse spirits,*
*Drift through the Three Prisons,*
*And for ten thousand kalpas, are reborn in lowly bodies.*

**Treason**
The *Scripture of Illuminating the True Regulations* states: In the boundless world, men and women born into the world commit acts such as killing their lords and fathers, plotting against their masters, destroying scriptures and teachings, and defiling the heavenly perfected. In death, they face evil retribution, their bodies cast into boiling cauldrons, their five limbs boiled to pulp, losing all human form. They are drenched in the juices of a hundred poisons, their pain unbearable, their suffering intolerable. For ten thousand kalpas, they are reborn among the six livestock, or as lowly people afflicted with deafness, blindness, and the six illnesses, taking inhuman forms, subject to being killed or kept alive by others to repay past enmities. The path of blessing grows ever more distant, the roots of sin deepen daily. They cannot attain liberation, eternally lost without return.

The *Feitianren Jiegong* states:
*"Plotting against and harming one’s lords and fathers,
Defiling and destroying the heavenly perfected.
In death, one is cast into boiling cauldrons,
Suffering pain without hope of return."*

The *Taiping Scripture* teaches:
*"All people who incur blame and retribution
Do so because they fail to cultivate their own virtue and discipline,
Lose the proper order of things,
And thus bear the burden of their transgressions.
For instance, if parents act immorally or wrongly toward their neighbors,
Their descendants may later be harmed by those same neighbors—
This is the clearest example of bearing the burden of past deeds.

Now, when ancient sovereigns ruled without aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth,
It was not merely that one person disrupted the cosmic order.
Heaven grows enraged and displeased,
So countless calamities arise,
And their successors inherit the blame.

Thus, the great sages of antiquity all knew the Way of self-cultivation,
And so their governance was harmonious, with few bearing the burden of misrule.

Later, the teachers of the world
Concealed the true teachings of the Dao,
Spreading instead superficial and ornate doctrines,
Going against the natural order of Heaven.
They caused later generations to be shallow and incapable of true self-cultivation and benevolence,
And over time, this led them to stray far from the Dao,
Believing no method could preserve them—
Thus, they suffered the disasters of inherited retribution.

Consider the great tree of the southern mountains:
Its branches stretch wide, covering hundreds of paces,
While its upper limbs bear countless fruits and blossoms of boundless worth.
But its roots are weak,
And when struck by great winds, all its branches, fruits, and blossoms are shattered and die.
This is the great fault of all things—plants and trees—
Bearing the burden of their own transgressions.

The fault lies in the roots,
Not in the branches,
Yet they punish the branches alone,
Never addressing the true source of evil.
Now, those without fault face disaster,
While the burden of retribution falls upon them.

How can it be just to blame the later generations,
Who through no fault of their own inherit the burden of past sins?
If Heaven were to grant all people eternal joy and goodness,
Yet they grow strong and rigid,
While the unworthy and wicked perish—
Would this not be a resolution of evil?
This is the full extent of the burden of inherited retribution,
Yet they blame only the present age,
So their governance cannot be just.

The people have long propagated false and corrupt teachings—
How could they now correct themselves?

Heaven, in its compassion,
Thus the Way of the August Sovereign aligns with the primal *qi* yet does not act.
**End of Volume Three of Daoist Canon Discussions**
**Start of Volume Four of Daoist Canon Discussions**

**Volume Four of Daoist Canon Discussions**

Miao Rui’s *Lingbao Zhenyi Ziran Jingjue* states: The **Zhengyi Zhenren** says: When people revere the scriptures and aspire to the Dao/Way, they may also receive true responses. Some hear the fragrance of incense pervading the air, others hear the harmonious sounds of *qin* and *se* zithers. Some hear the lofty recitation of scriptures in the void, or see radiant lights like the sun, or behold the **Ten-Directional Celestial Venerables**, the **Feixian Zhenren**, and such marvels. If one can attain such wonders, they must exert themselves with unwavering devotion—then they shall surely attain the Dao/Way of transcendence.

The *Taiping Jing* states: When a ruler practices virtue within, the winds and rains respond in due course without. Thus, the signs of auspicious response arise from within their own chest, so that all desirable actions bring forth these signs. Why would they not manifest?

It is the **utter sincerity** that moves the **August Sovereign** and the **Heavenly Sovereigns**—the **yin** and **yang** forces shift accordingly. Who compels them to act? The body cannot move them. What moves them is the **mysterious sincerity of the heart**, which stirs Heaven.

It further states: **Auspicious signs** are **clarity**, **tranquility**, **uprightness**, **rectitude**, **focus**, and **singularity**. The heart aligns with Heaven and Earth, never violating the natural order. The essence of Heaven and Earth, from ancient times to this day, rewards the virtuous with virtue, the wicked with wickedness, the upright with rectitude, and the perverse with perversion. This is the natural art—nothing is strange or unaccountable.

Thus, when a person’s heart is upright, clear, and tranquil, and their sincerity stirs Heaven, devoid of malevolent intent, auspicious signs and benevolent things emerge in threes and sixes and fours. The ancients, with their hearts pure and focused, could thus summon auspicious signs.

The *Zhuti Neiyin Jing · Dasheng Zhongzhen Song* proclaims:
*"Mysterious gatherings stir naturally,*
*The subtle signs burst from the void,*
*Awakening the world’s hidden destiny,*
*Obscuring the radiance of sun and moon,*
*Even the dark *yin* does not relent at night,*
*The Four Assemblies bow in reverence,*
*The divine currents respond in form,*
*Suddenly illuminating the boundless expanse."*

**Disasters and Portents**
The *Taiping Jing* states: Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, calamitous *qi* has never ceased—when it ceases, it rises again. Why is this so?

Their origin lies far back in time: it stems from ancient rulers who governed with petty measures, losing the **grand principles** and **orderly codes**. Thus, disasters never ceased, passed down through generations, accumulating into greater wickedness. Their harm grew profound, spawning anomalies and omens, continuing without end, bringing misfortune to all nations. Their source is truly distant.

Rulers, unaware, perpetuate this cycle, unable to restrain it. The people cry out in injustice, lamenting the movements of Heaven’s agents. The **true Dao/Way** loses its path, governance is impaired, auspicious responses grow rare, human intentions impure—making education even more difficult. The **perverse *qi*** stirs within, and though emperors grieve, their hearts long to halt it, like a thirsty man unable to quench his thirst. What then?

Even if the **Five Sovereigns** possess the benevolence of ten thousand people, they still cannot stop it—this is the **inherited disaster** of past rulers. Thus, they mistakenly conclude that **practicing virtue brings no benefit**, that **Heaven’s ways are ignorant**. They forbid people from evil, yet despair at their inability to reform them. Instead, they resort to mutual suppression and slaughter, hastening their punishments. When one person errs, their neighbors are implicated, bearing the weight of unjust retribution. The accumulation of evil *qi* grows ever more severe, doubling daily. They abandon the **Dao/Way of virtue** and the scriptures as useless, neglecting them entirely. They vie for talent, seeking wealth and office, and those who excel in seizing power are deemed the most capable. This is the **chaotic governance** that disrupts Heaven’s order—how could such rule align with the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** will? Heaven has long been afflicted by this.

The evidence is clear: **yin** and **yang** lose their proper course. When governance wins Heaven’s favor, then perversity can be eradicated, and rule becomes easy. Now, if we teach the **First Dao/Way of Auspicious Peace** and practice it earnestly, evil can be extinguished. Heaven’s aid to the virtuous is evident.

The inherited disasters of past rulers, though accumulated, can be easily removed in a single day. Now, the **Emperor** dwells within a hundredfold enclosure, applying the **Dao/Way of virtue**, **benevolence**, and **righteousness**, so that all under heaven—ten thousand miles of common folk—enjoy their blessings. Fathers are **kind**, sons are **filial**, households are **abundant**, and people are **well-provided**—none succumb to perversity.

**Portents and Omens**
The *Taiping Jing* states: Heaven aids those who teach **easy ways**, those who are **utterly sincere**, those who are **cautious and compliant**, those who **quickly understand**, and those who **eagerly obey**. It grants them great favor, thus teaching them. Those who do not reciprocate with sincerity are not taught.

It is like people in the world: if they are **intimately close**, they instruct one another. If they are not **deeply sincere**, they refuse to teach. If teaching is ignored, Heaven grows angry that its words are not heeded in time—so it abandons them, no longer instructing. Thus, disasters and portents cease, and no further warnings are given to humanity.

Even if one is **wise and saintly**, if they are **deaf and ignorant**, their **cleverness and insight** are sealed—Heaven and Earth’s spirits refuse to admonish them further. In ancient times, sages revered disasters and portents, using them to **rectify themselves**. Thus, they never erred even once in ten thousand cases.

**Divine Dreams and Omens**
The *Taixiao Langshu Jing* states: In the evening, when lying alone in repose, one must **keep the Celestial Scriptures** in mind. *(Now explained: The **Celestial Scriptures** are **jewel-like diagrams and talismans**.)*

Then, the **Supreme Mysterious** true immortals will come to guard one’s form, appearing as shadows and visions in dreams, speaking with the **true self**—within nine years, one shall meet them face-to-face.

**The True Persons**
The *Wushang Zhenren Neichuan* states: When **Yin Xi** was the **Count of Guan**, he often dreamed of the **Celestial True Ones**, sometimes even wandering with them beyond the **Four Seas**. His heart was **radiant and awakened**, and he **unconsciously harmonized** with the **Mysterious Saints**, attaining natural resonance. The **Venerable Master Lao** was moved by this.

The *Housheng Jiuxuan Daojun Liejijing* states: The **later sage’s** mother first dreamed of **Mysterious Clouds** entwining her form with the sun and moon—she was **stirred and pondered** by this, and in her pregnancy, **group dragons** spat water to wash her vessels.

The *Lingbao Zhenyi Ziran Jingjue* states: The **Zhengyi Zhenren** says: Those who shall receive the **Lingbao Scriptures** must first have **spiritual responses**. Some dream of seeing **Celestial Venerables** or true immortals, others behold **mountain-dwelling Daoists** or **cloud-chariots**, **jewel-umbrellas**, **dragons**, and **phoenixes**. Some dream of ascending mountains to see the **palaces of the sages**, or of flying through the void, or of gazing upon the **seven treasures**—rare jewels, **pearls**, and **jade**. Some dream of ascending to Heaven to meet the **Heavenly Kings** and **Celestial Lords**.

These are all signs of predestined alignment with the Dao, where **mysterious portents** foretell responses.

The *Cīyī Wǔlǎo Jing* states: The **Tàisù Zhēnrén** instructs beginners in the method to avert **malevolent dreams**. If one frequently encounters such dreams, there are three causes: **arc spirits**, **spiritual trials**, or **corpse bandits**—remedies to dispel them exist. Upon waking, pinch the *rénzhōng* (mid-brow) with the left hand **forty-nine times**, tap the teeth **forty-nine times**, and softly intone:

*"Great Cavern, Mysterious Primordial—
Strengthen the Three Souls!
The First Soul swiftly guards the Seven Spirits,
The Second Soul swiftly guards the *níwán* (cranial center),
The Third Soul receives the Heart’s governance.
Swiftly invoke the Three Sovereigns of Tàisù!
The recent encounter with an inauspicious dream—
This is the Seven Spirits consorting with a wandering corpse,
The source of ten thousand evils!
Urgent appeal to Peach-Kang for life protection,
To the Heavenly Kings and Five Elders, Nine True Ones—
All guard the Body’s Gate!
The Yellow Gate Divine Teachers, Purple Door Generals brandish iron bells,
Dispelling the malevolent crossing,
Reversing calamity into fortune,
Severing ties to life and death."*

When finished, if one lies down again, they shall surely receive auspicious responses. The *qi* of the prior malevolent dream, however, will be sealed beneath the **Three Passes**. Only after three years, when divine inspiration manifests, will dreams arise again—
All these are visions of future clarity,
Free from foreboding omens.

If one dreams auspiciously while asleep, it is auspicious.
If one dreams of good fortune and inwardly rejoices, this is a **virtuous response**.
Upon waking, rub the eyes **forty-nine times**, tap the teeth **forty-nine times**, and softly intone:

*"Most High, Supreme Refinement—
The Three Emperors’ Elixir Souls,
The Vermilion Palace, luminous and clear—
The Virtuous Response reveals its intent.
The Three Sovereigns’ Gentle Spirits,
The Heavenly Sovereign receives the Scripture—
All harmonizes as it proceeds,
Ascending Immortals of Upper Clarity,
Ever consorting with the Jade True Ones,
Together gathered in the Purple Court."*

This is the **Great Cavern’s secret key**,
Passed on to those newly crossing the Dao’s currents.

**Auspicious Omens**
The *Tàipíng Jing* states: Studying the **Great Auspicious Dao** at dawn and dusk yields **great fortune**.
Studying the **Moderate Auspicious Dao** yields only **moderate fortune**.
Studying the **Lesser Auspicious Dao**—
This is already the path of calamity.

It further states: The Sage-King deeply attains the **Heaven’s Intent** and the **Supreme Dao**, receiving celestial protection—
Thus, there are **a hundred fortunes**
And **not a single calamity**.

**Calamitous Omens**
The *Tàipíng Jing* states: Evil is the abode of death’s calamity.
Thus, those who do not earnestly study the Auspicious Dao
Shall inevitably fall into misfortune.
Calamity is the most reviled name under Heaven.
To speak of calamity—
It is the abhorrence of Heaven, Earth, Man, and all things,
An affliction that cannot endure,
The root of great disaster, the gateway to ruin.

**Alchemical Elixirs**
The *Tàishàng Tàizhēn Kējīng* states: When taking elixirs and medicines,
There is no need for lavish feasting.

「The *Tàishàng Tàixiāo Lángshū Jīng* states: To eliminate desire and extinguish private inclinations, to practice **serving and guiding** the **breath** and **alchemical nourishment**, the **Five Tooth Essence of the Red Pure** (赤精五牙), and the **Immortal Golden Elixir** (金丹玄素)—countless arts and myriad techniques—
**Assist and perfect** the **Way’s** success.
Use them according to **affinity** (随缘),
Do not **favor one over another** (不可偏滞).
If all arts are practiced yet no **dharma** (功) is realized,
**Merely hoping** for longevity,
There will never be **a single fruit** (成果).
This is because **worldly people**, when learning the **Dao/Way** (法),
**Cling excessively** to **partial techniques** (偏术).
Seeing their **sequential explanations**,
They deem them **marvelous** (奇),
Yet when practiced, they yield **no verification** (验).

It further states:
**Vain and false arts** (虚妄术) may claim to **assist** the **Way’s** success,
But their true **virtue/power** (德) lies in **transcending desire** (遣欲).
If desire cannot be **transcended**,
Then **through alchemical techniques** (因术) they **err in the scriptures** (迷经).
Those who **emerge from the world** (出世者) to **dine on the mist** (餐霞) and **nourish on celestial qi** (饵气),
**Corrupt** their **form** (身形),
Claiming to be **feathered guests** (羽客),
**Consorting with spirits** (神灵同游).

The *Wǔ Fú Jīng* states:
The **True Person** (真人) instructed **Yu the Great** (禹):
“Your **virtue/power** (功德) has **moved the spirits** (感灵),
So **Heaven and Man** (天人) **aid you in unison**—
Yet your **lifespan** (年命) **approaches decline** (向凋崄)!
Now I **reveal the oral precepts** (口诀) of **longevity’s Dao/Way** (长生之道),
And **demonstrate the method** (方) for **serving the True Treasure** (真宝服御).”

The *Bā Tǎn Sì Mén Gāoshàng Jīng* states:
**The Spirit Pass** (灵关) **unifies the Three Primordials** (统三元),
**Qi** (精) **transforms and binds the Five Spirits** (变结五神).
**Nine Refining the Palace of the Jade Embryo** (九炼琼胎府),
**Generating the Manifested** (化生表自然).
**Separation and union** (离合) **are propelled by the Portals** (港相推),
**Concentrating qi** (凝气) **to achieve transcendence** (成仙).

**Serving and guiding** fills the **Nine Spirits** (九灵),
**Still meditation** (静念) **summons the Jade Terrace** (降玉轩).

The *Míng Zhēn Kējīng* states:
**Born and refining the True** (生而炼真),
**Serving and guiding the Divine Elixir** (服御神丹),
The **Five Stones** (五石) **settle life** (镇生),
The **Divine Treasures** (神宝) **nourish the five senses** (五官).
Though the **virtue/power** (功) is **slight** (微) and the **virtue/power** (德) is **narrow** (狭),
If **destiny** (运) has not yet **ascended to Heaven** (升天),
The **body** (身) **shall suffer annihilation** (灭度),
Yet its **fragrant remains** (骸骨芳盈) **endure for countless kalpas** (亿劫不休).
When **spirit and form** (须神及形) **are both perfected**,
One **shall then receive celestial qi** (更受气),
And **rebirth in the mortal realm** (还生人中).
**Wisdom and insight** (智慧聪达) **shall flourish**,
**Foreknowledge of auspicious and inauspicious** (逆知吉凶) **shall be attained**,
**Spiritual penetration and clairvoyant vision** (通灵彻视) **shall be mastered**,
**Commanding ghosts and spirits** (役使鬼神) **shall be possible**,
**Endless cycles of transmigration** (轮转不绝) **shall be achieved**,
And one **shall gain the scriptures** (克得受书),
Becoming the **True Person of the Nine Palaces** (九宫真人).

**Gāthā** (偈):
**Through austerity**, one **refines the Dao of life** (修生道),
**Taking medicines**, one **cultivates the numinous herbs** (练芝英).
Though the **form is annihilated** (灭度) and **not at rest** (形不休),
The **body’s bones** (体骨) **radiate fragrance** (自芳馨).
**Guiding oneself** (导己).

The *Èrshísì Shēng Tú Jīng* states:
**Five Clouds of dense mist** (郁郁五云芝),
**Dark luster exhaling jade radiance** (玄晖吐玉光).
**Concentrating the vital essence** (凝津) in the **Palace of the Spirit** (洞灵府),
**Hovering within the Celestial Hall of the Sun and Moon** (徘徊日月宫).
**Five colors** (五色) **harmonize with the High True** (理高真),
**Flowing essence** (流精) **irrigates the Ten Directions** (灌十方).
**Breathing and calling forth** (呼吸) **without awareness of fatigue** (不觉疲),
**Ascending to the skies** (飞天) **with golden form** (并金容).
**Guiding and serving** to **consume spiritual qi** (餐灵气),
**Mystic nourishment** (玄哺) **fills the six viscera** (六胃充).
**Refined concentration** (精思) **easily achieves resonance** (易致感),
**Seated in stillness**, one **beholds the Void** (睹空洞).

The *Lǎojūn Guānshēn Jīng* states:
**Laozi** (老君) said:
“Unless one is **sage-like and enlightened** (圣明),
Who can **cherish the spirit** (颐神) and **nourish the nature** (养性),
Practice the **Dao of life** (生导气) to **transcend adversity** (度难)?
If one can **practice the Dao of life** (行生导气) and **guide qi** (载神),
**Transcending suffering** (离苦),
**Refining life** (修生) and **guiding qi** (行气) to **transcend the world’s calamities** (度厄世),
Then one is **a sage of the highest order** (上圣真人),
**A True Person** (真人) **who perceives subtleties** (达见识),
**Who knows the hidden mechanisms** (微知机) of the **Dao/Way** (道).

For those who **seek the Dao/Way** (为道者),
They **must practice the Dao of life** (行生导气),
**Guiding qi** (导气) to **carry the body** (载其身).

The *Lǎojūn Miào Zhēn Jīng* states:
The **Dao/Way** (道) says:
“When **Man** (夫人) **seeks the Dao/Way** (为道),
**Guiding the body’s five viscera** (道身五藏),
All **reflect on qi’s** (思气) **vitality, vigor, subtlety, and marvel** (盛壮微妙),
From **emptiness and nothingness** (虚无来),
Thus, **the substantial** (实者) **is not as good as the insubstantial** (不如虚),
**The existent** (有者) **is not as good as the nonexistent** (不如无),
**The rapid** (疾者) **is not as good as the slow** (不如迟).

The *Tàiyī Dìjūn Tiān Hún Nèi Biàn Jīng* states:
If one can **constantly practice** the **Nine Dawns’ method** (九晨照洞房泥丸之法),
**To inspect the spirit and soul** (检魂魄),
**To subdue the myriad malevolences** (制万邪),
And **cleanse and purify** (清净) the **Way**,
**To attract the qi of transcendence** (致仙灵之气),
**To descend it into the bedroom** (降於寝房),
This is called **invoking the Three Lights and Nine Stars** (引三光九星)
**To illuminate the hundred spirits** (以照百神).

**Embryonic Breath** (胎息)
The *Tàishàng Shuò Yùjīng Shān Jīng* states:
**The Void-Penetrating, Great Harmony qi** (冲虚太和气),
**Breathing and exhaling the flowing dew of the Five Clouds** (吐纳流霞津).
**Embryonic Breath** (胎息) **stillness** (静) **closes the hundred passes** (百关),
**Lone and vast** (寥寥) **penetrates the Three Orifices** (究三便).
Now **I explain the method of taking in qi** (释按服气法):
**Breathing through the nose** (息以鼻) **and not the mouth** (而无以口),
**To always store qi** (使气常储),
This is called **Embryonic Breath** (名之胎息).
Furthermore, **not breathing through the nose** (又能不以鼻气),
This is called **Great Embryonic Breath** (所谓大胎息),
Like a **child in the womb** (如儿胎在腹中),
**Breathing without need of external exchange** (气息而不须外彻).
If one can do this,
They **may also long dwell in water** (久居水中),
**Without shortness of breath** (而不短气),
And **gradually attain lightness of movement** (久久便能轻举).

The *Shàngqīng Sāntiān Jūn Lièjì Jīng* states:
**Embryonic Breath** (胎闭静息),
**Internally safeguarding the hundred spirits** (内保百神),
**Opening the Spirit Cavern** (开洞灵房),
**Firmly guarding the Three True Ones** (坚守三真).
**Swallowing the scenery** (吞景) and **gulping the dew** (咽液),
**Eating and drinking naturally** (饮食自然),
The **body shall not die** (身必不死),
And one **may achieve the Land Immortal** (可得陆仙).

The *Tàipíng Jīng* states:
**I ask**: Why does the **child in the womb** (胎中之子) **not eat yet have qi** (不食而气)?
**Heaven’s Dao** (天道) **has natural qi** (自然之气),
And **has qi of inhalation and exhalation** (消息之气).
All within the **uterus** (胞中) **rely on natural qi** (且而得气),
This is **Heaven’s Dao’s natural qi** (天道自然之气).
Once **born** (已生),
**Qi arises through inhaling and exhaling yin and yang** (嘘吸阴阳),
This is **qi of inhalation and exhalation** (消息之气).
If **Man** (人) **guards the Dao** (守道) and **studies earnestly** (力学),
**Returning to natural qi** (反自然之气),
This is **life** (生).
If one **guards qi of inhalation and exhalation** (守消息之气),
This is **death** (死).
Thus, those who **attain the True Dao** (得真道),
**Can internally possess qi** (内气) **while externally not possessing qi** (外不气).
**With this internal qi**, one **nourishes their nature** (养其性),
Then **can return to the state of infancy** (反婴儿),
**And restore their lifespan** (复其命).
Thus, one **must habitually cultivate internal qi** (当习内气),
**To internally nourish their form and body** (以内养其形体).
It further states:
**Ancient True Ones** (上真) **witnessed the Heavenly Spirit** (睹天神),
**Feeding on the qi of the mist** (食气象) as their **practice** (行),
Thus **they learned to consume qi** (学食气).
When the **True Spirit** (真神) **came to assist**,
Their **practice** (治) **was to dwell within the True Person’s abdomen** (乃游居真人腹中).
The **body of ancient True Immortals** (真仙之身),
Was called the **True Person’s dwelling** (真人室宅).

The *Tàishàng Zhēn Rén Mì Yào Jīng* states:
**Heavenly qi** (天气) is the **instrument of the numinous** (神明之器),
The **source of purity and turbidity** (清浊之宗).
When **dwelling in the Mysterious** (处玄), **Heaven’s qi is pure** (则天清),
When **within Man**, the **body is preserved** (则身存).
The **depletion and replenishment of life and death** (生死亏盈),
**Follows the rules of absorption and guidance** (摄御之间).

The *Dà Dòng Yù Jīng Zhù Jué* states:
**Consuming the primordial qi of the Mysterious Root** (食玄根之气),
**Makes the body clear and bright** (使人体中清朗),
**The numinous eightfold acumen** (神明八聪) **is perfected**,
The **body glows with sunlight** (身有日映),
The **face shines with jade dew** (面有玉泽),
The **eyes radiate luminous light** (眼生明光),
The **teeth contain purple qi** (齿含紫气),
The **intestines are firm and the viscera radiant** (坚肠华藏),
**Longevity and enduring vision** (长生久视) **are achieved**.
**Taking in morning dew** (服吸朝液),
**Suspended nourishment, cutting off grains** (悬粮绝粒),
The **essence of the Dao** (道要) **lies in the Golden Nectar** (於金醴),
The **marvel of its practice** (事妙) **is in the Jade Water** (於玉水).
This is called **breathing and exhaling the natural Great Harmony** (吐纳自然之太和),
**Guiding the ninefold essence of the Spirit** (御九精之灵气).”

「The *Nà Yòng* of the Dao’s teachings values naturalness above all.
**Virtue’s essence lies in stillness**, revering tranquility and contentment.
Those who embrace naturalness to refine the True,
and clasp serene detachment to rectify the false,
shall never meet with horizontal calamity** (横犯),
nor shall airborne misfortunes** (飞害) befall them—
this is the **core intent of the Dao** (可要道之旨者也).

The *Wǔ Fú Jīng* states:
*"To consume the qi of the five clouds is to attain ten thousand years of life,
and one’s form shall grow youthful and diminutive."
**Clouds** (云) here refers to the **qi of the five directions** (五方云气).
Understanding these five breaths,
one’s supple and tender frame flourishes like sprouting grasses—
thus it is called **"cloud-tooth"** (云牙).
Aspirants may thereby fill and solidify the **Five Visceral Storehouses** (五藏府),
but the methods are intricate and manifold,
too numerous to fully record—
details are found in the original scripture.
*(Note: Methods follow later.)*

The *Língbǎo Yùjué Jīng* declares:
The **Primordial Five Qi** (元始五气),
ever at the **Rooster’s Crow** (鸡呜),
ascend to the **Upper Hall of Lingbao Mountain’s Mysterious Capital** (灵宝玉山玄都上宫).
When **yang light first brightens** (阳光初明),
it disperses the **Primordial Radiance** (元始之晖),
pouring through all the heavens—
its movement circulates like a **wheel in motion** (车之轮),
ascending to **command the Nine Heavenly Gates** (九天之关),
consolidating the **Sacred Mountains of the Five Emperors** (五帝灵山),
and descending to **root the Five Clouds of the Aspirants** (学士五牙之根).
The **saints and sages of the Upper Hall** (上宫众圣),
greatly wise **True Persons** (大智真人),
all consume its radiance at this hour,
**tilting upward to swallow its essence** (仰咽其精),
thus harmonizing with the heavens,
and attaining boundless longevity.

The Dao instructs:
*"The method of **guiding and drawing the cloud-tooth** (导引餐牙),
ever on the **eight seasonal days** (八节之日),
each aspirant shall enter their chamber
and **meditate on the Five Elders’ forms** (存思五老形像).
After reciting the incantation,
they shall **follow their respective directions** (各随方导引),
**consuming the qi of the heavens** (服诸天气).
If practiced for **eight years** (八年),
**celestial officials shall arrive at their dwelling** (仙官到房),
**jade maidens shall attend as sentinels** (玉女侍卫),
their body shall **emit luminous light** (身生光明),
illuminating the **ten directions** (十方).
In their **comings and goings** (出入游行),
the **Five Emperors shall bow in homage** (五帝稽首),
and the **Three Realms’ officials shall escort them** (三界司迎)."

The *Èrshísì Shēng Tú Jīng* states:
*"Above, there is the **Qi of Immortality** (不死气),
which **cultivates the cloud-tooth and refines the Five Immortals** (殖牙练五仙).
Within the **Jade Cauldron of the Mysterious Middle** (玉芝玄中澳),
the body grows **pure and naturally fragrant** (体洁自生熏).
When **high-spirited essence descends** (精思高灵降),
they **mingle with the Sovereigns of the Five Directions** (交游上帝君).
**To consume the Yellow Qi** (服黄气)...»

The *Tàiqīng Yuánjūn Zhōng Jīng* states:
*"The **Divine Immortal Diagram** (神仙图) says:
The **Supreme Saints consume the Yellow** (上圣食黄),
the **Worthy Ones consume the Primordial** (贤者食元).
The **method of consuming the Yellow** (食黄之道):
**Uppermost, contemplate the Central Extremity** (上念中极),
which is the **spleen’s Yellow Person** (乃脾上黄人),
three inches in length,
with two hands also each containing a **Yellow Person** (黄人).
When the **Yellow Qi ascends** (黄气上升),
one shall **perceive their spirit** (即见其神),
slowly utter the incantation:
**‘Yellow Constant One, Yellow Constant One,
the True Person of the Yellow Court is within me.**
For me, take the **five-colored elixir-cauldron herbs** (五色丹芝草),
and all that may be **drunk or eaten** (诸可饮食者),
swallow them **three times, five times, and cease** (急咽之三五而止)—
then one shall be **sated** (即饱矣),
**plump, lusterous, and prolonged in years** (肥泽延年)."

The *Lǎojūn Guān Fú Tàiqīng Zhōng Jīng* states:
*"The **Divine Immortal Scripture** (神仙经) says:
**‘Ever contemplate the Yellow Qi rising from the spleen** (常念脾中黄气上升至口中),
**swallowing it three times, five times, and cease** (咽之三五而止),
then one shall be **sated** (则饱矣).
This can **ward off grains** (可以辟谷),
**sitting while others perish, standing while others die** (坐在立亡)."
The Master says:
**‘Ever think upon the spleen containing a Great Sun** (常思脾中有大日),
within which is a **Yellow Golden Treasury** (日中有黄金匮),
and within the treasury, a **scroll sealed with a Yellow Golden Seal** (匮中有书),
the seal **three inches broad and long** (广纵三寸),
inscribed with the character: **‘威嬉’** (Wēixī).
When one **focuses their mind and contemplates it deeply** (精而思之),
the **vision shall reach its limit** (穷则目出),
and the **omens shall manifest for reading** (兆能见而读之).
If the **heart opens and the eyes grow clear** (心开目明),
then one shall **attain the Divine Immortals** (则得神仙矣)."

**‘Ever contemplate the Yellow Central Field of the Stomach** (常念胃黄田中正),
white as **congealed fat** (凝脂),
within which the **Yellow Qi fills completely** (中有黄气填满),
rising to the mouth—
**swallowing it shall bring satiety** (上至口中，咽之即饱矣)."
The Master says:
*"The **Yellow Central Field of the Stomach** (胃黄田) is the **Grand Granary** (太仓).
All the **spirits gather within the Granary** (诸神皆来就太仓中食饮),
where there is a **Yellow Golden Stove, Pot, and Winnowing Basket** (黄金灶釜甑).
**Jade Maidens and Jade Boys oversee its operations** (玉女玉童主使令),
thus it is called **‘Yellow Constant One’** (黄常子).
This is the **culmination of the kitchen’s art** (致行厨矣).
**To consume the Sovereign’s Qi** (服王气)..."

*«The* **Laozi’s Scripture of the Embryonic Dao** (《老君胎中经》) *declares:*
**The Way of Naturally Abstaining from Grains** (自然绝谷之道) **— eternal life and prolonged years.**
**In spring,** one **harnesses the Essence of the Teeth** (承牙精),
**in summer,** the **Luminous Elixir of the Moon** (月灵),
**in autumn,** the **Revered Bright Dew** (明露),
**in winter,** the **Mysterious Essence** (玄精).
**A full cycle of three hundred and sixty days** (回岁一浃三百六十),
**with twelve phases** (四九转移十二) **completed in succession—**
**thus the five colors align in their due order** (从其方面), **distinct yet recurring without end.**
**The Dao is fully realized.** (道毕矣)

**The method of abstaining from grains** (绝谷之法):
**A full meal** (饱饭) **should not exceed twelve servings** (不过十二食),
**daily reducing one meal** (日减一餐) **until completion** (讫),
**on the eleventh day, reducing to eleven meals** (十一日减十一餐),
**leaving but one meal** (余有一餐), **halved and diminished** (分半减之),
**until the eighteenth day, when it is fully abandoned.** (讫十八日尽矣)
Though the **intestines are empty** (肠中虽空),
**the Qi of grains remains** (故有谷气).
**Sit upright and align with the Sovereign’s Qi** (正坐随王所在),
**stretch your hands and grasp the Qi** (舒手持气),
**tilt your head back and draw it upward** (仰头引气),
**then swallow it** (咽之) **— slow and deliberate** (安徐细意),
**guiding the Qi downward into the Stomach’s passage** (导气下入胃管),
**so the abdomen resounds with fullness.** (腹中立鸣)

**Nine times upward, nine times downward** (凡九上九下),
**the abdomen swells with great satiety** (腹因大饱),
**yet the mind must remain steady** (定心勿躁),
**for if the True Qi does not descend** (即真气不导),
**and the false Qi enters instead** (邪气中入),
**the result shall be poor.** (即不佳矣)

**By the twelfth day,** the **form grows light and agile** (形体轻便),
**by the eighteenth day,** the **Way is slightly perfected** (道小成),
**by the twenty-seventh day,** the **Way is moderately perfected** (道中成),
**by the thirty-sixth day,** the **Way is greatly perfected** (道大成),
**by the eighty-first day,** the **head and face radiate with light** (头面有光),
**by the one hundred and twentieth day,** the **Way is fully realized.** (其道备矣)
**The Original Qi is firmly established** (元气大定),
**and one becomes a True Person.** (仍是真人也)

*«The* **Supreme Scripture of the Eight Essences of Reality** (《太上八素真经》) *declares:*
**Always maintain purity and clarity** (常当清丽), **burning incense** (烧香),
**enter your chamber and lie facing south** (入室首南正卧),
**separate yourself from others** (断隔人物),
**block all extraneous thoughts** (杜绝他想).
**Close your eyes and gather the Qi** (临目闭气),
**knock your teeth together twenty-four times** (叩齿二十四通),
**retain the One in meditation** (存一如法),
**then visualize the* **Eight Trigrams** (八卦) *in their proper places:*
**Li** (离) *above the head* (在头上),
**Kan** (坎) *below the navel* (在脐下),
**Kun** (坤) *in the left palm* (在左手中),
**Xun** (巽) *in the right palm* (在右手中),
**Zhen** (震) *below the left foot* (在左足下),
**Gen** (艮) *below the right foot* (在右足下),
**Dui** (兑) *at the left ribs* (在左肋),
**Xian** (乾) *at the right ribs* (在右肋).

**The Eight Trigrams embody their forms** (八卦有象),
**within which the Qi resides** (象中有气),
**and within the Qi, the spirits dwell** (气中有神).
**The spirits of the True Person shine brightly** (神人光明),
**manifesting in all eight directions** (备列八方),
**as one exhales the Vital Qi** (口吐生气),
**filling the void of emptiness and space** (因满虚空),
**then dispersing after a time** (分良久).
**The Fire Qi** (火) *transforms in each season:*
**In summer,** **Li** *the Sovereign Qi generates Earth* (离王生土),
**in autumn,** **Dui** *the Sovereign Qi generates Water* (兑王生水),
**in winter,** **Kan** *the Sovereign Qi generates Wood* (坎王生木).

**The four seasons are governed by Qian and Kun** (四季乾坤),
**while Gen and Xun reign supreme** (艮巽王也).
**Their operations follow the moon’s revolutions** (其行者今依月回转).
**Xun governs the third month** (巽三月),
**Kun the sixth month** (坤六月),
**Zhen the ninth month** (轧九月),
**Gen the twelfth month** (艮十二月).

**The method of swallowing the Eight Qi** (咽八气法):
**Draw them through the nose** (以鼻取之),
**extending the breath fully** (极气则已),
**then swallow them subtly** (微微咽之).
**In the month of the Tiger and Rabbit** (寅卯之月), **swallow the Xian Qi** (噏震气),
**three breaths taken, three swallows** (三取三咽止);
**then drink the Li Qi** (次饮离气),
**nine breaths taken, nine swallows** (九取九咽止);
**in the next season, swallow the Xun Qi** (次季噏巽气),
**four breaths taken, four swallows** (四取四咽止);
**then swallow the Kun Qi** (次噏坤气),
**two breaths taken, two swallows** (二取二咽止);
**then swallow the Zhen Qi** (次噏轧气),
**six breaths taken, six swallows** (六取六咽止);
**then swallow the Gen Qi** (次噏艮气),
**eight breaths taken, eight swallows** (八取八咽止);
**then swallow the Dui Qi** (次噏兑气),
**seven breaths taken, seven swallows** (七取七咽止);
**finally, swallow the Kan Qi** (次噏坎气),
**one breath taken, one swallow** (一取一咽止).

**When complete,** knock your teeth together **thirty-six times** (叩齿三十六通),
**then massage and knead your face, ears, neck, and limbs** (摩熨面耳项至四支五体),
**repeating this until the extremities are fully warmed.** (周匝小极)

**At the time of practice,** one must **maintain a three- or six-hour fast** (清斋三时六时),
**offer prayers and supplications** (礼拜启愿),
**adjusting urgency to moderation** (缓急取中),
**according to what the person can bear.** (适人所堪)

**The Method of the Six Steels** (服六戊):
**The practice of Qi-Swallowing** (服气法) *declares:*

**The Method of the Three Lights** (服三光):
*«The* **Scripture of the Hollow Cavity’s Sacred Scrolls** (《空洞灵章经》) *declares:*
**At dawn, consume the Five Lights of the Vital Qi** (朝餐五灵气),
**at dusk, swallow the Three Morning Lights.** (夕噏三晨光)
*«The* **Scripture of the Twenty-Four Generations’ Diagram** (《二十四生图经》) *declares:*
**The Great Dao is subtly formless** (大道妙无像),
**and the movement of Qi condenses the Highest Reality.** (运气凝高真)
**The Void naturally generates** (结空自然生),
**while Xian transforms the two spirits externally.** (震化表二神)
**At dawn, draw the Five Stars’ Essence** (朝引五星精),

*«The* **Scripture of the Five Symbols** (《五符经》) *declares:*
**Consuming the Sun’s Essence** (食日之精) **shall ensure the child’s longevity.** (子必长生)
**For the Sun ascends to the heavens** (缘以上天谒元先),
**always on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the month** (常以月一日、三日、五日、七日、九日、十五日),
**from sunrise until noon** (日出时至日中), **one consumes it.**
**First, visualize within the heart** (先念心中有日):
**the Sun has a Mysterious Canopy** (日中有玄盖),
**beneath which stands a small child** (盖下有小童).
**Thus, the red Qi pervades the body** (故赤气遍身中身外九重),
**filling the nine layers within and without** (思气满头),
**and the Qi of contemplation crowns the head** (从顶出上升天日),
**then spirals around the Sun in nine layers.** (绕日九重)

**The incantation reads:**
*"O Sun Lord, Original Yang!*
**Return to the Vermilion Palace** (还归绛宫),
**and merge with me in virtue** (与我合德),
**together nurturing the small child."** (俱养小童)

**Then, visualize the Sun’s Essence descending** (因思日精来下),
**entering through the nasal passages at the crown** (入顶鼻孔中).
**Swallow it three times nine** (咽之三九满心中),
**until the heart is full.**
**Within the heart are three figures** (心中有三人):
**the left is* **Taiyi the Father** (太一父也),
**the right is* **Xuan Guang the Mother** (玄光母也),
**and the central one is* **the Crimson Infant, the small child** (赤子小童也).
**He sits upon a* **Golden Bed and Jade Couch** (坐金床玉榻),
**holding a* **Jade Basin and Jade Cup** (执玉盘玉杯),
**within which is* **the Divine Jade Flower Elixir** (杯中玉英神酒),
**alongside the* **Heavenly Cushion Grass** (并天芝草).
**One sees them consuming food and drink** (见在饮食之),
**yet never feels hunger or thirst** (仍不饥渴),
**and thus attains eternal life.** (而长生矣)

**Consuming the Moon’s Essence** (食月之精) **shall also ensure longevity.** (可以长生)
**For the Moon ascends to the heavens** (缘之以上天),
**always on the fifteenth night of the month** (常以月十五日夜半时),
**facing the Moon** (向月),
**one kneels twice and recites the incantation:**
*"O Moon Lord, Child of Light!*
**Return to the Elixir Field** (还归丹田),
**and merge with me in virtue** (与我合德),
**together nurturing the small child."** (俱养小童)

**Then, visualize the Moon’s white Qi and yellow Essence descending** (因思月光白气黄精来下),
**entering through the nasal and oral passages** (入鼻口中).
**Swallow it three times seven** (咽之三七而止),
**until completion.**
**The Moon’s Essence sustains the kidney root for eternal life.** (月精托肾根长生矣)

**Consuming the Stars’ Essence** (食星之精) **shall elevate one to* **Supreme Purity** (上升太清).
**Always at sunrise, mid-morning, noon, and midnight** (常以日出、晡时、日中、夜半),
**one meditates upon* **the Grand Sovereign Star of the Northern Pole** (上念北极太皇星),
**and recites the incantation:**

---

**To the Grand Sovereign of Heaven, the Supreme Dao Lord,**
**Your humble descendant, the aspirant of the Way, [Name] of the Small Dao lineage,**
**desires eternal life and seeks the Dao.**
**Now, contemplating the descending Essence of the Stars,**
**it appears between the two eyebrows,**
**flowing into the nostrils.**
**Swallow it three times five** (三五),
**and visualize the Qi filling the heart, spleen, and liver** (满心胆脾).
**The Dao Mother presides, nourishing the Red Child** (有道母主哺养赤子),
**thus granting eternal life without hunger.** (即不饥长生矣)
