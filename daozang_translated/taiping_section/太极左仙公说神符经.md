# 太极左仙公说神符经

The *Divine Talismans Scripture* as Spoken by the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate

At that time, the Immortal Duke dwelt in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven, silently guarding the Three Ones. The One is the Dao; the Three are the Mud-Pill Palace, the Crimson Palace, and the Cinnabar Field. The Most High expounded the *Scripture of the Three Ones* to be preserved within the body. Thus, the Immortal Duke, in guarding the Three Ones, attained stillness and communion with the divine.

Profoundly comprehending birth and extinction, within the stillness of inherent nature, he grasped the meaning of the great transformation’s cycles of arising and ceasing. Radiantly forgetting form, transcending the external flux of birth and death, he rendered all phenomena without appearance, emerging from the great transformation to abide in constancy—thus forgetting form.

With stabilized nature and wisdom, he entered the true Dao, universally awakening to all sentient beings, who, bound by unequal karmic deeds, experience sorrow and joy in alternation, love and hatred entangled. Those who wish to die live on; those who wish to live perish. Fathers and sons become estranged; husbands and wives part ways. Joy and anger arise in succession. Causes and conditions intertwine, leaving beings lost in delusion, with no means to transcend the world.

The attendant Daoist assembly—jade lads and jade maidens, the hundred spirit-officials—all, through wisdom and communion, observed and discerned with clarity, attaining right vision equal to that of the Immortal Duke.

Wang Xingcheng, the Master of the Left Terrace of the Great Ultimate, perceiving with his heart, knelt before the table, bowed, and addressed the Immortal Duke: “Great Immortal, regarding all this, I remain unenlightened. My mind follows the ears and eyes; my intent is deluded by greed and anger. Though at times I awaken, I soon forget and err. My capacity to gather the mind is still shallow. Death seizes my merit, and I return to darkness, following fate’s grasp, lifetime after lifetime, unaware and unknowing. My forms shift endlessly, without respite. How pitiable!

By what teaching may I ascend and transcend? I beseech the Great Immortal to reveal the essential Dao. We, your immortal assembly, shall propagate your words, universally delivering the deluded into the true Way.”

The Immortal Duke replied: “Excellent, excellent! Your wise thoughts arise from not knowing the Dao—strive to reflect upon it. I shall expound for you the wondrous Way of the accumulated sages, opening the gate of long life, that all sentient beings may universally depart from these sufferings. Harmonizing the primordial and aligning with the true, they refine form and ascend as spirit. Spirit congeals, the Dao abides. Shedding and liberating the dwelling body—this is to relinquish life and release form, that the spirit may reside in the rank of the immortal and honored.

Take this to heart.

The Daoist Zheng Yin stepped forward, bowed, knelt, and inquired about the essential method: “I recall that in former times, I attended the Heavenly Master before the Jade Steps. The Primordial Essence Lord of the Great One bestowed upon the Heavenly Master the numinous powder of purple radiance, called the Priceless Treasure. Each ascended the Dharma Hall and bowed before the Golden Portal. At that time, I intended to inquire into its mysteries. I only wish that the sagely master, in compassion for all beings, may cause this Dharma gate to universally pervade the ten thousand realms.”

The Immortal Duke said: “Excellent. The karmic roots of beings are still shallow, and they have no means to realize and know. Your question accords with my aspiration. Attend carefully to my words, and I shall reveal the method to you.

The Priceless Treasure is the preservation of the numinous and wondrous. The endowment of the numinous and wondrous is the gate of long life—preserving form, safeguarding spirit, harmonizing qi, and pacifying the true. From your one self, transform into two and three; four transformations succeed one another. Inner merit gives rise to the Dharma; the Dharma gives rise to the Dharma of existence; merit gives rise to non-merit—this is the radiance of the Dao. Benefiting oneself and others, causes and effects connect in cyclic succession, augmenting the supreme Dao. Through such merit, it is called the Priceless Treasure.

Transmuting cinnabar into gold, transmuting cinnabar into silver, transmuting gold into treasure, transmuting silver into numinous powder—treasure augments life; life augments conditions; through long life, one attains the conditions for realizing the Dao. Conditions augment karma; karma augments the Dao; the Dao augments clarity; clarity augments subtlety; subtlety augments transcendence; transcendence augments merit; merit perpetuates itself. Merit upon merit is the path of cultivation.

Through a thousand myriad kalpas, kalpa after kalpa, deliverance is bestowed. Delivering a thousand myriad conditions, universally enabling all with consciousness to accomplish the supreme Dao—through such merit, it is called the Priceless Treasure.

You who aspire to distant goals must know: the Priceless Treasure is the divine talisman elixir. The Primordial Sovereign Lord transmitted the divine talisman to the August Personage. This is what the Most High Dao Lord expounded to the heavenly assembly in the Red Brightness Heaven. The August Personage transmitted it to the Primordial True Lord of the Great Ultimate and Non-Ultimate. I now receive it from the True Person of the Great Ultimate—such is its method.

At first, the True Person of the Great Ultimate said to me: ‘For ascending to become a divine immortal, nothing surpasses the divine talisman.’ Have you heard of the Nine Cauldrons of Gong Sun, Emperor of Jing’s Plain? Gong Sun is the surname of the Yellow Emperor. The True Person of the Great Ultimate, Xu Lai, bore the immortal title. Jing’s Plain is the plain of the carved mountain.

The great cauldrons comprise three grades, each with three cauldrons, transmuting short and long lifespans. The three cauldrons of the lower grade transmute illness into immediate recovery. Of the three of the upper grade, the first is called Golden Flower. It was crafted by the Primordial Sovereign Lord and is called the Primordial Essence of the Great Yang, the Yang Elixir of the Most High Great Dao and Primordial Sovereign Lord. The Great One calls it the Dragon-Tiger Elixir; the Yellow Emperor calls it the Golden Flower Elixir.

The second is called Cinnabar Flower. According to the *Scripture of Cinnabar Flower*: in the left jasper chamber of the Great Clarity Palace, the divine elixir is named. It is called the Primordial Treasure-Generating Elixir of Heaven and Earth. The Jade Maiden of the Golden Flower, at the Heavenly Altar, transmitted the Nine-Cycled Divine Elixir to the Yellow Emperor.

The third is called the Divine Talisman—this is it. The potency of the medicine is such that it accords with divine creation, hence its name.

Thereupon, I bowed and entreated the True Person of the Great Ultimate: ‘My profound ignorance is unworthy of your supreme words. Yet, observing the sagely perfected establishing teachings and bequeathing instructions, those who ascend to join the ranks of heaven and humanity all embody the true One, contain the primordial harmony, harmonize yin and yang, and move the five virtues, thereby governing the hundred spirits and essences within their bodies. I only wish that the benevolent one may reveal the wondrous gate.’

In former times, while attending the fast pavilion in the Grotto-Heaven, I reverently heard the true words: ‘Yin and yang mutually impel one another to generate transformation; the five phases mutually restrain one another to open the numinous gate.’ What does this mean?”

The True Person said: “The numinous gate is the realm of the divine immortals. Opening the numinous gate speaks of the virtue of Ziming of the East.”

According to the *Chart of the Three Origins, Eight Perfections, and Three Forms*, it states: “That lead is called the Divine Maiden of the Great Yang, Ziming of the East, the essence of cinnabar.”

Xuán said: “What is the principle here, Benevolent One?”

The True Person said: “Metal nurtures water to settle it; water must preserve metal. This is the true nature of watery mercury. Wood nurtures fire to restrain it; fire must rely on wood. Fire is the generative nature of mercury. The essence of wood is inner fire and outer water—this is mercury, whose nature is fire yet whose form is water. The substance of metal is inner water and outer wood—this is lead, whose nature is water yet whose form and color are wood. Thus Ziming roams freely between metal and wood, meaning the spirit of the Great Yang abides between lead and mercury. ‘Bearing fire to return to wood, with water in pursuit’ speaks of Ziming carrying fire back to lead, where fire and water within the lead pursue Ziming. ‘Bearing water to return to metal, with fire as the carver’ speaks of Ziming carrying water back to lead, where fire within the lead carves Ziming’s water. Water and wood unite as one above; metal and fire share a single heart below. ‘Above’ refers to lead and mercury within the vessel; ‘below’ refers to the vessel’s size and its outer container. Thus, it is not contained by wood but restrained by metal. For this reason, it is called the Divine Child of the Great Yang, Ziming. Therefore, water can restrain water, and fire can restrain fire—meaning lead-water restrains mercury-water, and lead-fire restrains mercury-fire. Fire unites in nature; water unites in form. When water and fire press closely together, their color blazes brilliantly—this is the principle of it. It speaks of lead-fire uniting with mercury-fire in nature, and mercury-water uniting with lead-water in form; thus it is called the close pressing of water and fire.”

Xuán said: “What is the method of restraint, Benevolent One?”

The Supreme Polarity True Person transmitted the *Three Cauldrons Formula* to the Immortal Duke, who inquired about the meaning of yin-yang transformation and the mutual restraint of the five phases. The True Person, taking the Immortal Duke’s question as pertaining to the superior method, expounded the *Golden Flower Method*. The Immortal Duke, not having fully grasped its principle, further asked about its system. Knowing the Immortal Duke had not yet attained understanding, the True Person followed his intent and proceeded to explain the *Divine Talisman*.

The True Person said: “The vessel has no fixed system; its size depends on the heart. The medicine has no fixed quantity; its amount follows the vessel. The measure should not exceed three horizontally and five vertically—meaning the largest cauldron should not surpass a mouth diameter of three inches and a depth of five inches. The medicinal portion should not exceed one to three, multiplied by taels; one part in five and three is the ancient system, now increased by three. From one to three taels, three times five makes one catty. ‘Increased by three’ means three catties.”

Xuán said: “What is its standard?”

The True Person said: “First prepare the vessel; the vessel must be of gēng or xīn. The Ten Perfected Ones taught the *Divine Talisman Formula*, yet the Immortal Duke still had not fully grasped its wonder. Knowing the Immortal Duke’s aspiration lay in refined vessels, the True Person shifted his meaning and transmitted the *Divine Talisman Method*. If this is not feasible, the Metal Duke will also suffice—meaning if one does not use a gēng-xīn horse vessel, one may employ the Metal Duke’s vessel. From this point onward is the *Divine Talisman*.

Bind with iron, enclose the flowing pearl, and suspend it within the cauldron. Fill the cauldron with water to the bottom, ensuring the form is not exposed above. Let the water surge greatly, but not overflow. In a separate vessel, warm water to replenish what is lost. Constantly stir with a willow spatula, about a hundred times, or fifty or sixty. Drop the pearl into cold water, then bind it with silk. If it binds, it may be used; if it does not bind, repeat the process until it does—there is no fixed number of pearls, as the amount may vary as desired.”

Xuán said: “Once bound, may more be added?”

The True Person said: “Commit it to the cauldron and block it with wood. Wood is the mother of cinnabar; thus, mercury within the cauldron must be restrained. Blocking it with wood means knowing to suppress and seal, preventing any opening. Once the iron sealing is complete, construct the furnace. Suspend it between heaven and earth, filling it without spilling. Let a cloth fly to the side, evenly regulating the outflow. Then fire rises from below to await the civil and martial. The civil is thirty *kè*; then drench it to enter the martial. The martial is thirty *kè*; then the chestnuts form. Exhaust the water from the Heavenly Pond (the name of the water basin) and remove the fire from the Earthen Chamber (the name of the earthen furnace). Release the seal, remove the dregs, and examine its depth. If it is clear and bright enough to serve as a mirror, it is subdued. If it is cold and the seal is hard and white without liquefying, then bore a hole below and refine it with pure bellows. Wait until it is cool and clear before settling the essence.”

Xuán said: “Once the essence is settled, may more be added?”

The True Person said: “Grind it into powder. ‘Grind’ means to file and polish. Spread the powder within the cauldron, sealing it firmly. Water and fire do not differ from the essence. Await the bottom turning red as the constant standard. Observe with the eyes and guard with the heart. After a full hundred *kè*, the Way is accomplished. Adjust the seals and refine the joints; the prohibitions and taboos for ingestion are the same as in the *Golden Flower Method*. The Immortal Duke, having understood its meaning, thus had the True Person complete the method in full.

I further inquired: “This one phrase is the Immortal Duke addressing Master Zheng. Formerly, I heard that nothing is greater than essence for securing form and preserving spirit. Since it is called the *Golden Flower*, why is it also termed the *Divine Talisman*?”

The method surpasses all others; the *Golden Flower* is the greatest. The True Person resembled the great sound that is rarely heard, the great image without form, the great vessel that is late in completion. Worldly people, their natures restless and their conduct disturbed, are certainly unable to accomplish the *Golden Flower*. Praising the *Divine Talisman* for its swift and easy completion, the Immortal Duke thus harbored doubts and asked.

The True Person said: “The *Golden Flower* contains the correct qi of yin and yang, embodying the essence and radiance of the four seasons. Its power is costly, and its completion rare. The medicinal measure does not exceed sixty-four parts, yet the daily reckoning spans three hundred and sixty-six days. The *Divine Talisman* is not so—its body is pure yang and refined virtue, containing the supreme principle of the five phases. It replaces the cold and heat of the seasons with day and night, and shortens the sun and moon’s measured degrees. What it subdues is fifty-four taels. Its efficacy is swift, its use vast, enabling those who seek immortality to avoid toil and distress—this is the intent of the *Divine Talisman*.”

The Immortal Duke said: “Siyuan, have you grasped this meaning?”

The Immortal Duke recounted the True Person’s words: “The *Scripture of the Golden Flower* requires a full year to refine a single *jin*, while the *Divine Talisman* completes three *jin* in the span of one *fu*-cycle. Given its brevity of time and abundance of merit, the *Divine Talisman* surpasses the virtue of the *Golden Flower*, standing as the most numinous, enlightened, and supreme medicine.”

Fearing that Master Zheng had not fully understood, the Immortal Duke thus expounded the method in full. “Since receiving this scripture, I have never transmitted it to the assembly of immortals. Yet in recognition of your sincere entreaty, you ought to take it to heart.”

With these words spoken, the perfected immortals and Daoist hosts all attained the source of the method. The immortals of the four heavens, moved with joy, together played celestial music, its sound flowing through the heavenly realms, resounding even to the distant immortal seats. Fragrant blossoms and the *Step-in-Void* hymn praised the Supreme Dao, as all reverently received the teaching and returned to their respective heavens.

The Immortal Duke said: “Siyuan, I now return with the heavenly hosts to my original heaven. You who remain in the world must diligently aid and protect, delivering all from suffering and hardship, guiding them to long life. Cultivate secret practices and do not bring misfortune upon yourselves.”

Bowing in concealment and touching their foreheads to the ground, they held the Dharma-sound in their hearts, propagating the teachings, which were named the *Scripture of the Divine Talisman*.

“The *Golden Flower* enfolds the nature of the five phases and embodies the qi of the four seasons, serving as the root-source of all methods and the foremost of numinous medicines.” The Immortal Duke had already transmitted this to the True Person of the Great Ultimate.

Now, addressing Master Zheng, he said: “To replace years with days and overcome scarcity with abundance—thus attaining the *Golden Flower* of the Great Dao—yet still prizing swift completion, I remain perplexed. If the Immortal Duke, measuring Master Zheng’s capacity for understanding as yet unripe, adapted his teaching to suit his nature, then this is the reason for its preservation.”

The Left Immortal of the Great Ultimate and the assembly concluded the discourse on the *Scripture of the Divine Talisman*.
