**The Water and Cloud Collection**

*Scripture Title:* *The Water and Cloud Collection*. Composed by Tan Chuduan of the Jin dynasty. Three juan in length. Source text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Taiping Section.

**Preface to The Water and Cloud Collection**

Dongmou was an ancient state of the Muzi, a major commandery of Qi. Its households were vast, and its people simple and unadorned. To the east, it bordered the Bohai Sea, where misty waves and surging clouds stretched boundless, extending for tens of thousands of *li*. To the south, it faced the Kun and Jian mountains, their layered peaks towering into the heavens, rising for thousands of *zhang*. With such a convergence of sea and mountain brilliance, the land was blessed with exceptional talent, and eminent figures and scholars emerged in every generation. It was only fitting that perfected beings and immortals would arise in succession.

Master Tan, styled Chuduan and known as Master Ever-True, hailed from a prominent family of our homeland. From birth, he was keenly perceptive, possessing an extraordinary bearing. Skilled in cursive and clerical script, he was upright and principled, earning the respect and awe of his village. In the *dinghai* year of the Dading era, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct and Compassionate Transformation, Chongyang, arrived in the east, his pilgrim’s staff alighting upon the shores. Drawn by past karmic affinities, he sought out old friends. In our homeland, he encountered Master Danyang (Ma), Master Ever-True (Tan), in Donglai Yishui, Master Ever-Living (Liu), and in Dengzhou Qixia, Master Ever-Spring (Qiu). They became a spiritual family beyond the world, known as the Four Masters: Tan, Ma, Qiu, and Liu. Together, they followed the Perfected One’s travels, journeying west to Yimen. There, the Perfected One entrusted them with oral instructions, charged them with future affairs, and then departed this world to ascend as an immortal. After the four completed the burial rites, they led their disciples west to Zhongnan Mountain, the former retreat of the Perfected One. There, they transmitted and inherited his Dao for over a decade. Thereafter, each went their separate ways.

Master Ever-True wandered along the Luo River, transforming and delivering people through his teachings. Wherever he went, followers gathered like clouds. His compositions—odes, rhapsodies, poems, hymns, and lyrics—flowed effortlessly from his brush, numbering several hundred pieces. He also authored *Recorded Sayings* and *The Song of the Skull’s Liberation*, awakening the world with their warnings. All his works concealed wondrous efficacy, expounding the true wind of the Dao, guiding people toward goodness, and bringing great benefit to the age.

Abbot Wang Liuhui of Quanzhen Hermitage in Junzhou and others carved printing blocks to publish and disseminate his teachings far and wide. In the bingwu year, a great flood swept them away, scattering the blocks and causing their loss. Master Ever-Living of Yishui, Liu, moved by compassion, opened the path of expedient means and dispatched his disciples Xu Shoudao, Li Daowei, and Yu Wuxian to my hometown, entrusting me with a preface. They wished to commission craftsmen anew to carve the blocks and ensure the teachings’ enduring transmission—truly the intent of a benevolent heart.

I once reflected that Master Ever-True and I were from the same village, of similar age and like-minded in youth. As children, we played together; as adults, we traveled as friends. Yet in middle age, he met his teacher, studied the Dao, and shed his mortal form to ascend as a perfected being. Meanwhile, I, with graying temples and hoary hair, still toil in the arena of fame and profit, content to await my end, declining with the world—how foolish I have been!

I shall now cast off my restraints, relinquish the old ox’s love for its calf, and abandon the great rat’s fear of others’ greed. I will roam freely in the realm of self-attainment, laughing and wandering in the realm of true leisure. I will study the Master’s Way, recite his writings, and nurture the harmony of heaven to spend my remaining years. I wonder if, in days to come, the Master might recall our old companionship and deign to lend me his rosy clouds as a sash.

Alas! The Master has already taken flight as an immortal. Later scholars will never witness his steps nor hear his voice. Yet his profound mysteries, wondrous principles, and enduring example remain. By carefully savoring these writings, they may yet grasp them.

On the full moon of the first month in the dingwei year of the Dading era, this preface was written by Fan Zede Yu, Instructor of Dongmou Prefecture.

*Collected Works of Water and Clouds, Volume One*
Composed by Master Ever-True of Kunlun Mountain, Tan Chuduan

**Seven-Lawregulated Verses: Inscribed at Chaoyuan Palace in Luoyang**
The palace gates stand still, sealed in auspicious mist,
Yet ancient traces and sacred marks remain as if present.
Clouds shroud linked branches where the alchemical cauldron boils,
Rosy dawns rise from the numinous well to irrigate the elixir spring.
The sun’s essence refines the land of Huaxu,
The moon’s spirit gathers the realm of endless day.
Since the Purple Edict summoned the Perfected away,
Who now shall succeed as the Great Luo Immortal?

**Visiting Ling Mountain Temple**
Leisurely I wander clouds and waters to seek the Chan grove,
Jade-like bamboo glows thickly against emerald peaks.
The Jade Pillar Peak stands high, unstained by dust,
Ling Mountain Temple hides where few may find its realm.
White snow blends in even drifts like jade spread,
Golden blossoms scatter amidst yellow flowers.
On an autumn night by the limpid ancient pool,
Osmanthus blooms alone reveal the original heart.

**Visiting Magistrate Liu’s Garden**
A host of worthies invites me to admire the fragrant bloom,
After rain clears, I pass alone through the bright gate.
By the balustrade, peonies vie in splendor,
Around the courtyard, butterflies contend in lofty flight.
The wind stirs willow eyes with ruthless intent,
The rain washes flower hearts clean of right and wrong.
All things merge into spring’s single qi,
Selfless, it scatters its fragrance everywhere.

**Presented to the White-Haired Elder Guo of Xinzhong**
How many ever reach the white-haired elder’s state?
Birth, aging, sickness, and death mark the beginning and end.
Foul impurities and rank desires shorten lifespan,
While greed and envy turn the mind to darkness.
Love and hate make transcending the world difficult,
Desireless and passionless, one attains liberation.
Fortunate that paths to heaven and hell exist—
Sages and fools, delusion and awakening, all rest with you.

**Presented to Immortal Cheng of Yunyang**
The greatest fear in cultivation is stubborn bronze,
For one clad in stubborn bronze gains no merit.
When the heart stirs with false dust, one sinks to the underworld,
When the mind abides in purity, one walks the celestial palace.
You must emulate Yanzi’s joy in poverty,
Not crave Deng Tong’s wealth and greed.
Learn from Master Ma of Zhongnan,
Who dwelt in utter destitution within the ring.

**Presented to Immortal Zheng**
Leaving the world, he dwells in a hermitage beyond things,
Silently cultivating, erasing traces, ceasing all debate.
Wondrously he purges filth, delighting in pure poverty,
Using clarity to wash away ignorance, content with plainness.
His thatched door stands unbarred—what hinders him?
A single gourd suffices to quench greed.
Calm and still, he sits in effortless ease,
Piercing through the three lights of sun, moon, and stars.

**Presented to Young Master Han on Cultivating the Dao at Home**
Uphold truth, initiate goodness, establish the mysterious hall,
Diligently offer incense morning and evening.
Within, serve your widowed mother with filial devotion,
Without, uphold integrity to align with the Three Lights.
Always act with compassion to lift the poor and distressed,
Frequently extend mercy to relieve those in misfortune.
If one day your wisdom awakens,
You too shall return to the immortal realm.

**Presented to Disciples Anranzi and Others**
The Master’s subtle words enlighten all,
Do not idly exhaust qi and spirit.
To seek the treasures of the sea’s depths,
Refine the mountain’s summit to eliminate the slightest flaw.
The heart chasing worldly passions harms qi and fire,
The mind wandering in craving injures the spirit’s blade.
I hope you awaken early to the illusory world,
And avoid another cycle in the human realm.

**Presented to the Eighty-Year-Old Daoist Nun Yang**
Seeking the mysterious, the eighty-year-old Daoist nun Yang,
A jade-like flower blooming after autumn’s frost.
Her jade cup brims with water of purity and stillness,
Her golden censer must glow with fragrant wisdom.
Now she has secured future blessings,
Henceforth, what doubt remains of past misfortunes?
In the serene and empty hall, free from obstruction,
The precious cauldron naturally reveals rosy light.

**Inscribed at Master Kong’s Hermitage**
The empty gate stands silent, sealing the numinous spring,
Delighting in the spring’s profound mystery upon mystery.
Secluded, it often draws idle visitors,
In quietude, it shares its abode with the sleeping phoenix.
The cool and pure realm transcends the dusty path—
Only by treading here does one know another heaven exists.
If the seeker is willing to look in lowly places,
They shall suddenly behold the immortal.

**Presented to Marshal Wang of Junzhou**
Noble Wang delights in the mysterious current,
Urging me earnestly to invert the jade cup.
Goodness accumulates gradually from the heart,
Merit must be sought within one’s nature.
Benefiting others while diminishing the self reveals true principle,
Enduring insults with compassion unlocks wondrous depths.
Equanimity and harmony are the great Dao—
Three shall ascend together in the divine vessel.

**Inscribed at Yunxi Hermitage**
At Yunxi, the recluse lies amidst mist and rosy clouds,
Silently drinking the sun’s essence and moon’s radiance.
Mists disperse from the cinnabar terrace, revealing auspicious herbs,
Clouds gather around the numinous crucible, forming jade-like blooms.
The Azure Dragon exhales fire to brew golden tea,
The White Tiger digs springs to irrigate jade sprouts.
When dragon and tiger unite, the work completes nine cycles,
A single grain of the elixir holds cinnabar’s treasure.

**Expressing My Aspirations**
I admire poverty and leisure to explore the wondrous mechanism,
Thus knowing my body enters the realm of white clouds.
Carefree beyond the world, I transcend the dust’s net,
Unfettered within, I shed the garment of defilement.
Fearing harm to hidden merit, I examine my faults,
Anxious to avoid moral injury, I shun others’ blame.
When the nine-cycled cinnabar elixir is complete,
I shall invite the Three Immortals to return with me.

**Again**
Blunting sharpness, subduing strength, I become good,
Suddenly both heart and method are forgotten.
In the cauldron, the vajra flame frequently rises,
In the furnace, the prajna incense perpetually burns.
The jade elixir first blooms—only I gather it,
The immortal peach ripens—I taste it first.
Do not say the land of Huaxu is distant,
In perfect emptiness, the path is not long.

**Again**
A single shortcut leads to the immortal source,
At the cave’s mouth, numinous clouds veil the verdant peak.
When winds and waves arise, wield the sword of wisdom,
Where the mysterious waves settle, pluck the golden lotus.
The dragon subdued, it sleeps in the Li palace,
The tiger captured, it rests in the Kan chamber.
When these two are pacified, worldly affairs end,
With merit complete and conduct fulfilled, the embryonic immortal is born.

**Again**
Longing for the immortal source’s enduring scenes,
I purify the numinous land and spread jade-like fragrance.
The Red Child of the Southern Palace dwells in the cool hall,
The Black Tortoise of the Northern Sea resides in the crimson chamber.
In the Pure and Still Grotto, the White Tiger is imprisoned,
On the Effortless Mountain, the Azure Sheep are herded.
Since the clouds gathered within the cauldron,
I perpetually drink the divine nectar, lying in drunken bliss.

**Again**
The Daoist’s home is desolate and free,
Embracing weakness, following conditions, passing the years.
Against the cold, coarse robes of paper suffice,
To sate hunger, plain rice with greens will do.
Forgetting words, distant from worldly ties,
Abandoning thoughts, the Dao’s profundity grows.
Those attached to wives, children, fame, and profit—
When their limits approach, their regrets shall be as thick as hemp.

**Again**
The celestial mechanism runs deep, few comprehend it,
A single grain of the elixir is held at noon.
Mists roll back from the ancient pool on an autumn night,
Clouds gather from the green peaks in the moon’s glow.
The dragon is seized and imprisoned in the lofty cauldron,
The tiger is captured and bound in the Kan pool.

The immortal elixir is refined, transcending creation,
To hasten to Penglai Isle and pay homage to the true master.

**Again**
The wind sighs through pines, rustling and light,
Roaming beyond the world, one with the immortals.
The nature shines like the bright moon flowing through the azure sky,
The heart drifts like idle clouds across the boundless blue.
The fierce tiger is captured and imprisoned in the Kan gate,
The dragon is subdued and bound in the Li palace.
The vajra flames rise repeatedly through the celestial cycle,
Forging within the furnace a single crimson grain.

**Again**
A luminous point illumines the towering terraces,
Clearly realizing non-arising, transcending coming and going.
On the Seven Treasures Mountain, the crimson flames are extinguished,
In the sacred land of the Three Palaces, the white lotus blooms.
The purple court of mist and rosy clouds draws near,
The cloud-path to Yingzhou is left behind, never to return.
Who shares the portion of the never-night Jade Capital?
The Four Companions attend the Ever-Spring Immortal.

**Again**
A green serpent, three feet long, carried in the sleeve,
A single grain of cinnabar coalesces at the proper hour.
Mists shroud the clear deep, imprisoning the colt,
Smoke veils the verdant peaks, binding the ape.
After a thousand mornings, the dragon leaps into fire when the work is complete,
After nine revolutions, the tiger enters the pool when the merit is fulfilled.
Seizing the true creation of emptiness,
The celestial mechanism runs deep, few comprehend it.

**Again**
Desire’s cunning surpasses defilement and idle speech,
Awakening to this, one departs from all extremes.
To sever desire and forget emotion is to grasp the wondrous principle,
Smoke disperses and fire dies, attaining the profound mystery.
Mouth agape, tongue raised—how can the work be accomplished?
Thoughts arise, heart stirs—how can the path be perfected?
Cutting off worldly ties, nothing remains,
In desolate solitude and quiet simplicity, one passes the remaining years.

**Again**
True practice, true conduct, arranged in secrecy,
Ten years of diligent care, nurtured with utmost devotion.
The mind forgets worldly realms, transcending the other shore,
Worldly passions and thoughts perish, arriving at Penglai.
The buried treasure-sword’s radiance pierces the Dipper,
The pearl hidden in the clam silently nurtures the embryo.
Cultivation must rely on true creation,
To fathom creation, refine the heart to ashes.

**For Disciples**
Leaving the secular home to enter the Daoist’s,
Is like treading mist and rosy clouds from level ground.
In the world of dust, time is fleeting,
Within the immortal’s gourd, days and months stretch long.
The carefree life of drifting clouds and waters is true livelihood,
Emptiness and purity are the virtuous way of life.
Constantly observing desirelessness, worldly ties grow distant,
Unawares, the great cinnabar coalesces within the furnace.

**Again**
Hold to the One, truly abide, recognizing inner tranquility,
Diligently and arduously practice, refining the heart to uprightness.
The path to the Mystery Origin is not easy,
Yet within the square inch, no dust—this is not difficult.
In the twelve hours, remain ever vigilant,
Within the three thousand merits, do not deceive or slacken.
If you seek the path ahead without coming or going,
Deeply contemplate the view of no-self, no-person.

**Again**
Subdue strength, temper sharpness in cultivation,
Extinguish the self, subdue the heart, sever worldly ties.
Silently polish, removing cleverness and eloquence,
Drowsily forge, casting off ferocity and savagery.
Where ignorance arises, the true spirit darkens,
When softness and weakness arise, the Dao-eye brightens.
Each battle with ignorance is waged,
Each act of endurance is a victory.

**Again**
Eradicate evil, remove passions, act with goodness,
Best to forget both fame and profit together.
On the mountain’s peak, extinguish the fire of ignorance,
In the sacred chamber, constantly add the incense of prajna.
When all dust and grime are removed, the bright mirror appears,
When wasteland is cleared, the jade lotus blooms.
Do not weary of the distant path of cultivation,
For the road to emptiness is not long when fully realized.

**Again**
In cultivation, one must recognize the spirit’s source,
Recognizing the spirit’s source, a single point shines fresh.
Passions and desires forever severed, transcending the dharma realms,
Ignorance and anger extinguished, departing from heaven and humanity.
Cease the inverted delusion of clinging to existence,
Do not stir the dusty heart to taint myriad conditions.
Within the emptiness and stillness of the nature, no obstructions,
Naturally, in leisure, the embryo of the person is born.

**Again**
In the empty hall, silently burn the heart’s incense,
This is the true Daoist sanctuary of my gate.
Entering emptiness, seek freedom,
Dispelling afflictions, find coolness.
The symbols Kan and Li arrange the furnace and hearth,
The hexagrams guide the celestial cycle, refining white and yellow.
Eternally, ceaselessly, follow this practice,
When the work is complete, the nine revolutions yield lead frost.

**Again**
In cultivation, do not seek within the dharma,
Clinging to dharma in search brings no freedom.
Recognize that your own heart is the Buddha,
Why exhaust yourself in external wanderings?
The spirit’s source, wisdom’s illumination—let dust not obscure it,
In responding to things, let no thought linger.
Two paths of pure wind open the jade gate,
A single silver stream emerges from the mountain’s peak.

**Self-Reflection**
From the outset, cutting off love to practice austerity,
Holding to the One, embracing poverty, my resolve unwavering.
Bamboo hat and sheepskin are constant companions,
Tattered felt and a sack ever follow.
Rich mutton and fine wine hold no allure,
Plain rice and leftover broth suffice to stave off hunger.
A wooden bowl, newly acquired by begging,
Still the same as when I first left home.

**Expounding the Dao**
Roaming beyond the world like a cloud-and-water immortal,
A single grain of elixir severs worldly ties.
True emptiness coalesces the treasures of the Three Fields,
Wondrous function perfects the five-petaled lotus.
Fire dies, smoke disperses through forging,
Heart clear, intent still—through single-mindedness.
Carefree and unrestrained, the eternal true one,
Sailing the boundless prajna boat for ten thousand miles.

**Again**

**Wandering the Cloud-Water Path**

Cloud-water wandering, a home wherever I stay,
Careless of the sun and moon as years slip away.
In leisure, wisdom’s waters fill the golden crucible,
In stillness, the numinous field sprouts jade shoots anew.
Beneath the sea, red peonies are nurtured to bloom,
Atop the mountain, white lotuses form in the blue.
I now reveal the treasure beyond the dust—
Inherent thusness is itself the great elixir sand.

**Again**

Cloud-water wandering, an immortal beyond the world,
Leisurely and still, the original heaven unfurled.
Preserving the heart, extinguishing the self to unlock the golden chain,
Diminishing intent, forgetting passion to break the jade lotus’ stem.
On the farther shore, searching for the profound and wondrous,
Within the sacred mountain, securing a karmic bond most auspicious.
When the elixir is refined through nine revolutions, a pure breeze carries me,
Loosening the moorings, the prajna boat drifts free.

**Following the Rhyme of Master Hu Zi Jin**

Cultivation is neither easy nor hard to attain,
Beyond the shallow, nurture the true, and know the inner calm.
Hastily flee the scorching fire pit,
Early ascend the cool and serene Dao’s shore.
Constantly observe desirelessness to penetrate the profound principle,
Marvelous subtlety lies in emptiness, beyond love and stinginess.
Purity and non-action depend wholly on resolve,
Preserve the heart, weaken the self, in stillness and solitude.

**Sent to Master Yao**

Revered by all, Brother Tan stands tall,
Yet entangled in heavy sins within the net’s thrall.
Reflecting on past transgressions, karma lessens its weight,
But knowing faults yet persisting, sins accumulate.
A heart drawn to greed and desire invites disaster’s blow,
A mind attached to vanity piles sin upon woe.
Diminish, preserve, humble yourself low,
Who knows if the sages will deign to bestow?

**Seven-Character Quatrains**

**Roaming Mount Hua**
Coarse food and patched robes mark the passing years,
High among white clouds, hidden in mist’s embrace.
Heart’s incense rises from the numinous source,
In samadhi, the lotus peak blooms ten feet wide.

**Composed at Qimen Town, Where Daily I Prepare Medicine for the Multitude**
Clever in many arts, yet feigning foolishness,
In non-action, guarding the One, nurturing the spirit pearl.
Suddenly awakened, the dream of toil and dust,
Alone I drink the wine of no-birth, a single gourd.

**Ode to the Solitary Bamboo**
A jade-green stalk rises from the fragrant thicket,
Upright in node, hollow in heart—none compare.
Enduring snow, defying frost through the years,
Naturally, from time to time, a pure breeze stirs there.

**Ode to the Moon Osmanthus**
Green leaves, supple stems, crimson buds unfold,
Spirit in every blossom, dancing in the clear wind’s hold.
With pine and bamboo, it endures the cold’s test,
Claiming the year’s glory, the work of creation’s behest.

**Ode to the Crane**
Still and solitary, facing the autumn wind,
Black and white distinct, the work of creation’s hand.
Marvel not at its thousand-year longevity,
For atop its crown, the red elixir is grand.

**The Three Teachings**
The three teachings have ever been one family,
Dao and Chan in purity differ not at all.
Confucius walked upright, penetrating the profound,
Those who awaken ride the rainbow’s call.

**Expressing My Feelings**
Not knowing to seek emptiness beyond the external,
Dragons and tigers are tamed, their power inverted.
Lazy in morning and dusk at incense and prayer,
Within the twelve hours, only the heart is worshipped there.

**Again**
Dim and silent, profound and abstruse,
In purity and non-action, guarding nature’s truth.
The true nature congeals, aided by true qi,
Boundless transformations may pierce the sky’s roof.

**Again**
Now my cloud-water path is my former vow,
Carefully observing the eight-line verse I avow.
To extend years and increase life’s span,
Refine the golden essence, recognize true compassion.

**Again**
On the twenty-ninth day of the month, I drink,
A hundred years hold thirty-six thousand scenes.
Unheard in the world are my affairs,
Returning, I enter the land of drunkenness.

**Again**
Formerly reckless, fierce, and coarse,
Today I preserve my heart, hoping karma’s weight grows less.
Within the twelve hours, ever vigilant,
Who knows if heaven and earth will grant forgiveness?

**Again**
Moths drawn to the lamp’s flame, unaware of the blaze,
Fish lured by fragrant bait—just the same.
Moths charred, fish rotted—do you know?
Better to dwell in Jetavana’s bough.

**Again**
Masters Tan, Ma, Qiu, and Liu,
Wandering freely, at ease in their practice true.

The celestial cycle refines boundless treasures,
A single radiant light is self-attained.

**Again**
Ancient Buddha’s Lingyan is my home,
A realm of cool purity, free from sorrow’s moan.
The Daoist’s livelihood holds no other task,
Only gathering the Three Lights to forge the azure haze.

**Again**
Now I see through the moth’s love for the flame,
The fish lured by bait, playing in dark waves’ game.
Foul and filthy things at root they be,
Adorned with guile, they craft illusions cunningly.

**You Huaichuan**
With a heart’s source clear, all matters cease,
Beyond this mystery, what more could one seek?
A belly vast and round, unstained by dust,
Roam freely through Huaichuan’s streams at will.

**Again**
To govern with pure virtue is to cultivate the Dao,
Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and compassion surpass leaving home.
Having walked this path of merit to its end,
One shall surely ascend on clouds of radiance.

**Again**
Plowing cloud-fields across three thousand miles,
The moon pierces dusk’s veil o’er a hundred thousand homes.
In the clear night, a jade-green pool gleams bright,
The clam swallows silver moonlight, birthing cinnabar’s light.

**For Zhang Dianshi**
A hundred years of time flash by in a blink,
Diligence in cultivating immortality’s pact—how could one not think?
Even if one returns as top scholar in triumph grand,
The truth dawns: yellow millet’s dream was but a fleeting strand.

**Five-Character Regulated Verse**
*For the Mother of Master Zhao of Chang’an*
Teeth and hair reborn in black,
Longevity’s three causes in her track.
Utmost sincerity follows the Dao’s friend,
Meticulous reverence serves the lofty Perfected One.
A tranquil mind tames the monkey and horse,
A pure heart gathers qi and spirit’s force.
With proper demeanor, I bow in respect,
Kowtowing to the long-lived one I protect.

**Exhortation to Cultivate the Dao**
Hear my method to cleanse the heart,
In effortless ease, its savor imparts.
Within the formless, wondrous use,
Within the formed, inner light infuses.
People are stained by desire’s embrace,
Passion arises, harming spirit and qi’s grace.
When people sever passion and desire’s chain,
Step by step, they tread the immortal’s domain.

**Five-Character Quatrain**
*Exhortation to Cultivate the Dao*

**Studying the Dao**

To study the Dao, dispel the illusory,
To refine the true, empty the void of emptiness.
The root returns to one source—
Bright moon and clear wind.

**Again**

Wine, lust, anger, and wealth all spent,
Worries, sorrows, and cares forgotten.
Clinging thoughts and loves severed,
The five-petaled jade lotus blooms fragrant.

**Again**

The Great Dao is ever pure and still,
In non-action, it guards the natural.
If the heart does not turn back,
Where can words transmit it be sought?

**Again**

Sitting alone in a ring-shaped hut,
Solitude’s purity tastes most sweet.
Effortless, with nothing to do,
Silently guarding the Three and Three.

**Again**

Gathering those *pāramitā* blossoms,
Brewing them into *prajñā* tea.
Steeped in water of purity,
After sipping, the yellow sprout appears.

**Again**

Ever seeing desire as suffering,
Tiles and pebbles turn to gold.
Seeing the body as dung and dust,
The bright moon shines on jade peaks.

**Again**

When the heart is clear and fresh,
Speech and silence harmonize spirit and qi.
Purity dissolves all sins,
Non-action unbinds all demons.

**Ode to the Dawn Rooster**

Its crow scatters the moon from the city wall,
Calling forth the sun to rise in the east.
Wondrous, this true virtue—
Awakening the old man in his dream.

**Admonition on the Brush**

Only when the brush’s dust is fully shed
Can the Dao be embraced in wordlessness.
Split open the eye of true Dao,
And the false spirit is diminished.

**Hymn**

First—

To learn the Dao and cultivate truth is to go against the world,
A solitary body drifts like tumbleweed in flight.
Following conditions, let pass and dissolve past transgressions,
View death as returning—yet never return.

A grimy face and disheveled hair break worldly vigor,
Coarse robes and plain meals shun luxury and excess.
Ever pure, ever still, acting through non-action,
In the twelve hours, silently observe and reflect.

**Second**

Grasping and questioning leave little to say,
For originally there is no dharma to transmit.
Only when right and wrong are fully extinguished does wondrous communion arise,
When self and others are both forgotten does one awaken to the profound.

Purity, stillness, poverty, and leisure are companions,
While qi, wealth, wine, and sensuality are like sworn enemies.
If in this life you wish to ascend the cloud path,
You must embrace emptiness—without it, immortality is unattainable.

**Again**

A jeweled hall, exquisite, leans against the azure sky,
Solemn and compassionate, the sacred image is veiled in auspicious clouds.
Within three thousand merits, diligently tend the incense and flame,
In the twelve hours, pay homage to the holy countenance.

The true body is cleansed through tempering,
The mist of the numinous cliff disperses for the mysterious wind.
In the idle cauldron, where clouds gather,
A single grain of cinnabar congeals into crimson.

**Again**

For ten years, ever silent,
Today the mystery is revealed.
Water gives birth to the crimson phoenix,
Fire nurtures the black turtle child.

A cool breeze blows atop the mountain peak,
The bright moon shines on the cold stream.
The demon-subduing divine sword is personally transmitted,
Seizing the flood dragon by the tail and lifting it.

**Again**

With a cool heart and warm kidneys, cultivation is attained,
Only by awakening to this does one grasp the wondrous mechanism.
In the twelve hours, without contrivance,
The horse and monkey roam freely, harming the sacred fungus.

**Again**

Who understands the hair swallowing the great sea?
How many know the mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru?
In daily life, always discern gain and loss,
When merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, bodhi is seen.

**Again**

Wine, sensuality, wealth, and qi—one great barrier,
When thoughts and passions are extinguished, one emerges from the dusty world.
Not even a thread should cling to the numinous source,
For if it clings, the elixir will surely fail to form.

**Again**

After six years, the fire of ignorance is fully refined,
After ten years, the bone-transforming elixir is perfected.
In the serene and empty hall, nothing remains impassable,
One knows then how to leap beyond the gate of life and death.

**Again**

For ten years, I’ve studied like a fool,
Drifting aimlessly, east and west.
If you ask about the wind’s child and the practice of cultivation,
It is when the fire dies, face grimy and hair disheveled.

**Again**

A wild crane, a solitary cloud—no companions,
In the profound and wondrous, words are forgotten.
Silent, dim, alone in vigil,
Limpid as the autumn moon over a cold pool.

**For Xue Balang**

The numinous being is ever at ease,
The borrowed body free from illness.
Purity and spontaneity,
Nature abides, life endures.

**Again**

Six years on Snow Mountain,
Nine years facing the wall.
The Dao is not easily attained,
To become Buddha or immortal.

**For Master Mu**

On the northern slope of Mount Taihua, the venerable immortal Mu,
Devoted to purity and stillness, explores the profound mystery.
Mending the leakless garden of Jetavana,
Ever-flowing wisdom waters irrigate the heart’s field.

Capturing the monkey, binding the horse atop the emerald peak,
In samādhi, no need for the coin to buy mountains.
Abandoning the mundane, embracing the mysterious, the heart awakens in accord,
The causes of good and evil lie in past-life affinities.

Incense of the heart rises from the numinous source,
Vast and obscure, reaching the heavens above.
The autumn moon over the jade-green pool is perfectly clear,
Wildflowers and singing birds—mere idle clamor.

In the cauldron, the fire extinguished, the golden pistil blooms,
On the wood, without smoke, the jade lotus forms.
When merits and deeds accumulate to three thousand,
Nature is perfected, the elixir congeals, and one journeys to the origin.

**Song**

**First**
Formless...

Gathering the dark pearl is not with gold or cowrie,
On Spirit Mountain, a single trail of fragrant smoke delights.
Perfumed into the untainted, stepping the deathless path,
Fivefold rosy radiance gathers beneath the wisdom canopy.

This numinous numinous—everywhere present,
Its wondrous workings fill empty space, without inside or out.
Where nothing exists, all is empty—even emptiness is empty,
Dharmic forms, fruits, and causes all tainted by love.

Variously transcending the three realms’ awakening,
Instantly like the Thus-Come One’s sudden bright understanding.
Pursuing texts and parsing meanings is but vain toil,
Speaking of sages and discoursing on worthies still fabricates strangeness.

No cultivation to complete, no destruction to suffer,
When realms vanish and the heart is forgotten, contemplation is free.
Like sands of the Ganges, crystal-clear—then dust and grime,
Entering and exiting without doubt is the subtlest marvel.

The lion’s cub, within the Jetavana,
Roars—what fox dares face it?
Before the Bright Moon Hall, jade pistils fragrant,
In misty fusion, the golden lotus assembly forms.

Dismissing cleverness, dispelling sharp wit,
Originally self-possessed—what need to purchase?
From the mountain’s head, vast and surging, the numinous spring wells,
Washing out empty space, leaving no trace of attainment or denial.

Meeting Chongyang, the teachings clarified,
Neither advancing nor retreating.
Since entering the wondrous and recognizing poverty and leisure,
One knows the extinction of past sins.

Ceasing debate, abandoning knowledge and understanding,
Concealing radiance, appearing as darkness and obscurity.
Let sun and moon rush busily on,
While here, following conditions, this skin-bag is lodged.

**Second**
**The Skull**

Skull, skull—ugly in countenance,
Only for in life’s love of flowers and wine.
Artful smiles, light robes, and willful joy,
Flesh and blood, skin and muscle gradually decay.

Gradually decaying, still craving,
Greed for wealth, leakage—uncontrollable.
Desire without end, the body finite,
Until today, becoming a skull.

Becoming a skull—you, listen well:
The seven-jeweled human body is not easily made.
You must understand life and destiny like a hanging thread,
Casually do not follow human sentiments.

Thus I present this image to you,
See if today you awaken or not.

**Third**
**The Fallen One**

I am fallen, I am fallen,
My whole body clad in paper and cloth.
Waving my hand as I walk, all things forgotten,
Delighted in this body, empty and alone.

When hungry, I seek; when weary, I sleep,
Originally dwelling in the cool and clear land.
The wisdom sword gleams, seizing the sun’s light,
Countless demonic forces all kept far away.

Delighting in true leisure, achieving true interest,
The crooked path’s desolation—I do not go.
The true numinous, upright, gradually becomes clear,
Transcending, I walk the misty and rosy path.

Attaining true cultivation, thoroughly completing,
When truly obtained, there is nothing to say.
The crystal palace abides in tranquil ease,
Seeing through spring flowers and autumn moon.

Again—
I am fallen, I am fallen,
Ragged cloth always thus worn.
Freely drifting beyond the world,
Everywhere empty, with no reliance.

Sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the city,
Unskilled in talismans or selling medicines.
When hungry, I wander door to door for a coin,
When sated, all things are equally let go.

Abiding in leisure, without use or action,
Human sentiments—fine threads to be pared away.
Dragon and tiger, infant and maiden—all unattainable,
Silently savoring the pure ghee.

Not doing good, not generating evil,
Sitting, lying, coming, going—empty and alone.
A heart of pure leisure and cool indifference,
Let the four great elements drift as they will.

Severing the mechanisms of the passions, without calculation,
No hope to ride clouds or mount cranes.
Carefree and at ease, delighting in poverty and leisure,
Winning the freedom to follow conditions in peace.

**Following Master Danyang’s Rhyme on the Topknot**

Bell-companions, Haichan as ancestral founder,
Striking the jade bell, sounding the golden drum.
Piercing through the central point of brightness,
The numinous youth leaps out, dancing west.

I feign foolishness, yet not foolishness,
Foolish talk conceals what is not foolish.
True words, without flattery,
Utterly free of dust, mechanisms, and cares.

Lifting the Li male, leading the Kan female,
Guiding the Yellow Dame to wander the Pure Land.
Abiding and walking, sitting and sleeping,
Sometimes wrapped in felt, sometimes in paper quilts,
Quietly, clearly—always thus.

Half like a fool, half like a dandy,
Within foolishness and dandyism, still self-aware.
Such tidings few know,
A taste of pure emptiness and tranquil blandness suits best.

Joy is anger, anger is joy,
Inversion—originally I am you.
Through a thousand trials and ten thousand refinements, seeing the original,
Clearly, clearly—only when the heart is fully understood.

**Record of Teachings for Disciples**

All people revolve in birth and death without cease,
Only because of the heart.
Master Deshan said: When the heart arises, myriad dharmas arise; when the heart ceases, myriad dharmas cease. If a single thought does not arise, then one transcends birth and death.
What is the heart?
It is because sentient beings possess the three poisons of greed, anger, and delusion, and the heart of ignorance.
The Master said: Leaping out of the three mountains’ mouth—this is it.
Those who awaken thus cultivate,
Severing emotions and loves, breaking strength and blunting sharpness,
Subduing and extinguishing the unwholesome hearts of sentient beings,
To see the true nature before the original parents’ birth,
The original face.

What is the unwholesome heart?
On every realm, the arising of the ignorant heart,
Vulgar greed, jealousy, lust for wealth and beauty,
Various calculations, thoughts arising and ceasing without end.
Bound by these karmic obstructions, familiar realms of old,
The true source is obscured, liberation unattained.
To extinguish them completely is to see one’s own nature.

How is seeing one’s own nature named?
In the twelve hours, thought after thought, pure and still,
Unobscured by all illusory, familiar realms of old love,
The true source unclouded,
Always abiding as empty space,
Carefree and at ease,
Naturally, spirit and qi harmoniously unite.
In cultivation, if this one matter is understood,
What birth and death are there to fear,
What sins and obstructions to dread?

If even slightly a thought arises, not pure and still,
It is an obstruction within, not called freedom—
How can one arrive?
Only if all of you are single-minded as a mountain,
Unmoving, unshaken,
Pressing forward, encountering great demons,
Exhausting this one life,
Never looking back,
The former vow will surely be fulfilled.

Master Jin said:
A pure heart and settled intent—the path to heaven,
A scattered heart and confused intent—the gate to hell.

**The Upper Volume of *Shuiyun Ji* Concludes**
**The Middle Volume of *Shuiyun Ji***
**Composed by Tan Chuduan, the Long-Truth Master of Kunlun Mountain**

**Lyrics: Seven *Leijiang Yue* (*Niannujiao*)**

Our school’s three patriarchs—Zhong and Lü, and Hai Chan—
Transmitted the profound mysteries.
Master Chongyang passed down wondrous words,
Lifting us together beyond the Three Isles.

Slowly we seek the true,
Nurturing the numinous root,
Gradually sprouting the yellow sprout of grass.
Within the nothingness, there is yet something—
The wind of wisdom now bears glad tidings.

A single point, luminous and boundless,
Traversing the sands of the world,
Each thing perfectly bright and clear.
All varieties of emptiness return to fundamental being,
Inside and out, all inverted and reversed.

This principle is deep and subtle,
Clear and void, ethereal and distant—
The practitioner must arrive.
In dim stillness, in silent obscurity,
Even the wise and sagely know the Way in darkness.

**Again**
The Dao of nature,
Endowed with the primordial root,
Gathers the true and perfect spirit.
A single point of numinous light, without inside or out,
Bright and penetrating, radiant through the gate of mystery.

Stillness and simplicity are most fitting,
Poverty and leisure are best—
A carefree place beyond the world.
Ever undimmed,
Abiding serene in the chamber of spirit.

No matter how wondrous and unfathomable,
One must rely on resolve,
Firmly securing the primordial yang.
Diligently refine the celestial true,
Everywhere turning back to contemplate.

The lotus blooms within fire,
The flame on the mountain’s peak extinguishes—
Truly, the cause of their meeting.
The Wind Immortal reunites,
Together roaming the cloud paths of the Three Isles.

**Again**
The one numinous true nature—
Why did it drift into the mortal womb, the dusty realm?
Seduced by floating splendor, clinging to love,
Turning and turning, the true trace grows dim.
For kalpas uncounted, it could not escape;
Now once more it errs,
Piling sin upon sin.
The original form—
How can it be discerned and sought?

One must still both seeing and hearing,
Abandon emotions like clouds and water,
Beyond the world, seek the profound principle.
In lonely solitude, pure and wondrous,
Who would care for a withered, toiling body?

Seizing the whirlwind,
Resplendent and radiant,
Silently refining the golden liquid.
The divine elixir shines forth—
Birth and death, afflictions and cares, all cease.

**Again**
The jade flower gradually unfolds,
Urged by the pure wind,
Gathering the radiant light of golden lotuses.
Through kalpas of delusion, all is illuminated,
Straight through the gate of non-doing.

Seven returns of the light,
Threefold emptiness awakened and illumined,
Amidst the golden flowers’ intervals.
Diligently refined,
Naturally, the infant and maiden abide.

This subtle, wondrous truth—
From the moment one begins,
The foundation is eternally firm.
The lotus forms its jade fragrance, the numinous orchid grows,
Deeply moved by compassion’s frequent regard.

Within the tripod, clouds gather;
In the furnace, the elixir congeals—
After nine transformations, they meet again.
Following the master’s cloud steps,
Together they roam the immortal paths of Peng Isle.

**Ode to Bamboo**
I love your fine beauty,
Facing the cloud hermitage,
Personally planting a cluster of jade-green stalks.
Emerald shoots, moist and sleek,
Leaf upon leaf, stalk upon stalk, tender green.

Gradually bearing offspring,
Still surpassing the mother,
Roots twisting like coiled dragons.
In the rustling wind of night,
Moonlight shines through, sifting jade.

Fitting the recluse’s secluded heart,
Beside the idle window, a companion,
Naturally abundant in pure wind.
Never withering, its substance unlike the crowd,
How could it resemble common flowers and trees?

Defying snow, scorning frost,
Hollow-hearted, straight-jointed—
All wondrous principles are beyond the vulgar.
Naturally solitary and simple,
Daily increasing blessings beyond the world.

**Gazing at the Moon on the Night of the Lantern Festival**
On the Lantern Festival’s fine night,
Just as the full moon,
Steps westward through the celestial channel.
The pale orb hangs in the sky, limpid and deep,
Alone revealing its cold light, unattached.

Bright radiance fills heaven and earth,
Impartial, illuminating all,
For ten thousand ages without flaw.
Like a precious mirror,
Luminous, suspended in the vast expanse.

The crimson towers and jade pavilions of Guye,
A gathering of immortals,
Phoenixes alight, clouds descending.
Auspicious vapors and propitious mists envelop the jeweled halls,
Gold and azure glow intertwined.

Drunk on peaches of immortality,
Riding the rosy clouds away,
Sleeves trailing fragrant traces.
Facing Song Mountain from afar,
A promise within the silver platter.

**On Wine**
Du Kang discovered the wonder,
Brewing the true essence of the Three Luminaries,
Clear, pure, and rich.
The immortal talent of Li Bai, drinking with abandon,
One cup, a hundred fine verses.

The old man of Mount Dao, carried home drunk,
The children of Xiangyang,
Laughing and singing, clapping in unison.
Tao Qian beneath his hedge,
Drunk and sleeping outside the Five Willows.

In Dongli, life and death both forgotten,
Waiting for guests, cutting hair,
Tao’s mother entertains worthy friends.
Wenju, carefree, fills his cup,
Fragrant wine often opens laughing lips.

Rejoicing in the age of Yao,
The land of drunkenness, abundant and joyful—
Such things were rarely heard of in ancient times.
The spring hues of the jade pot
Prolong life’s blessings and years.

**Eleven *Shengsheng Man***

Long ago, my brother Tan,
Bound by family ties and nurturing care,
Accumulated sins like a mountain.
Then he met the immortal master in the east,
Traveling to the Three Isles of the sea.

Exhorting the stubborn and foolish toward goodness,
Awakening to the wheel of rebirth,
Abandoning love to turn back.
Following conditions, he passed through,
Guarding purity and meekness,
Wandering as clouds and water.

Later, passing the immortal palace of Huaizhou,
Strolling through a noble county,
He encountered deep autumn.
Gradually entering the cold of severe winter,
Nowhere to take shelter.
He could only beg for paper and cloth,
Hoping the various lords would remember a fellow traveler.
If they awaken,
Let them join cloud companions and rosy friends,
Together cultivating beyond the world.

**Again**
Long-Truth bows deeply,
Covering all worthies—
In cultivation, only the heart must be firm.
Day by day, trembling and cautious,
Ever fearing faults may arise.

Plain and simple, poor and meek,
Never at ease,
Refraining from composing verses.
True merit lies in
Crushing the strong, subduing the sharp,
In silent stillness, forgetting words.

If there is nothing, go door to door begging,
Before others, do not display
Brilliant elegance or madcap airs.
Conceal your radiance,
Silently refining the elixir field.
After a thousand days of effort,
This small matter is secretly transmitted.
When merit is complete,
Ride auspicious clouds to return and attend the Origin.

**Again**
At first, learning the Dao,
Entering the gate of mystery,
Carefree and wandering beyond the world.
Occupying a hut day and night,
Inevitably seeking.
Diligently coming and going,
Entangled in worldly toil—
How could one awaken to true cultivation?
This path—
When will merit be complete,
To ascend Peng Isle?

Suddenly, vast and clear, a fierce awakening—
Examining the original, single point,
What idle sorrow is there?

In destitution, indulging in cloud-wandering,
Freely seeking immortal companions.
Like a fine hawk released from its cage,
Or a monkey freed from its lock.
I depart—
Shattering all illusions, then at rest.

**Again**
Chasing fame and profit,
Entangled in love and desire,
Drifting in confusion, lost in haze.
Unaware of fleeting vanity,
Silently aging the youthful face.
A hundred years pass like lightning,
When the limit arrives—
Who will face it with composure?
Refusing to awaken,
Only then do they regret,
Each one the same.
Swiftly realize the perilous path ahead,
Turn back step by step,
And re-enter the immortal sect.
Don the simple robe and blue headscarf,
Befriend cloud companions and misty friends.
Cease seeking esoteric wonders outside—
Recognize the spirit’s source,
Where the red elixir blooms like a lotus.
Seek the true realm,
Revel in the mountain’s bright moon and clear wind.

**Again**
Vast and boundless, the sea of suffering,
Riding waves, drifting with the current—
Best to recognize the escape.
Wife and children, beloved kin,
Are but karmic foes from past lives.
Indulging in fleeting vanity,
Squandering primordial yang
Without end.
When the limit comes—
What scheme will you devise,
To escape the dark and obscure?
Failing to awaken to such peril,
Scheming day and night,
Calculating, craving, pursuing.
In an instant, rebirth—
Sinking through a thousand lives,
Ten thousand kalpas adrift.
Suddenly abandoning, entering the mysterious and wondrous,
Avoiding the three paths,
The six realms of wandering.
Act swiftly—
With wind and beings beyond the world,
Form bonds with companions.

**Again**
Vast and boundless, the sea of suffering,
Drifting with the waves, lost—
Foolish as moths drawn to a flame.
Ever deluded by wife and concubine,
The love of children.
Bound by such snares,
When the limit arrives—
Alone you descend to the Yellow Springs.
If you awaken,
Abandon fleeting love and vanity,
Dwell in quiet cultivation.
Gradually sever worldly attachments,
Nurture the heart, cultivate qi,
Conceal your traces, bury your name.
Coarse food, plain clothes,
Silently refine the spirit’s clarity.
Then the true person manifests,
From nothingness—
Gold and jade take form.
When the great elixir ripens,
This single spirit of true nature
Endures forever.

**To Master Mu**
The gate of cultivation—
First, know the sequence:
Sever ties with sons, abandon wives.
Fiercely cast off worldly attachments,
Embrace solitude—
This is fitting.
With nothing, extend your hand in the streets,
For warmth, paper and cloth serve as garments.
Go with the flow,
Uphold poverty, softness,
Quench the fire, humble the heart.
In daily practice, bind the monkey, tether the horse,
Abide in non-action, purity,
Silently attune to the true master.
When realms vanish and the heart is forgotten,
Spirit congeals, qi forms the magic fungus.
Attaining carefree freedom,
Compose poems, exhort the deluded.
When merit is complete,
Point the way to Peng Isle—
Ride a cloud home.

**To Master Zhao**
Master Zhao entered the Dao,
Fiercely embracing the mysterious,
Severing illusions in sudden awakening.
Facing circumstances, cultivate without pause—
The fire nurtures the lotus.
I now offer sincere words:
When met with spears and blades,
Receive teachings with magnanimity.
If afflicted,
Dwell in a hut as if dead—
Do not return home.
Steadfastly emulate such resolve,
As sages and worthies secretly reflect,
A flawless mirror shines.
When fire fades and smoke clears,
The spirit’s crucible yields the yellow sprout.
Selfless nature stabilizes, life endures,
The heart pure—
Jade crystallizes the cinnabar.
When merit is complete,
Ascend Penglai, guided by cranes,
Amidst cloud-borne banners.

**To Zhang Jiulang**
Heaven and hell,
Good and evil arise from the heart,
Life and death—
Awakening or delusion, who prevails?
Awakening, abandoning family ties, forgetting the heart,
Extend your hand in the streets.
Embrace simplicity, poverty, softness,
Wander as clouds and water,
Free and untethered.
Hold fast to resolve,
Uphold the eternal,
Enduring without end.
When old karmic debts near their end,
The mysteries of sages and worthies
Are secretly transmitted.
The heart pure, the mind clear—
Naturally, the treasure forms in the elixir field.
If even a trace of transgression remains,
Calamity returns—
Unspeakable sins.
When all is understood,
Ascend the three isles of Penglai,
Become an immortal.

**To Brother Feng of Chang’an**
Exhort others to do good,
Cultivate yourself—
Both align with the Dao.
Avoid the俗世乡土,
Keep your distance.
The wondrous medicine cures deep illness,
Without regard for noble or base, high or low.
Naturally, it follows reason—
Emulate Master Longxi,
Uphold precepts and practice.
Cultivation demands fierce resolve,
Like great rivers and mountains,
Steadfast, unshaken.
Outward conduct, complete and perfect—
One day, attain non-action.
Wandering as clouds and water,
Qi and spirit harmonized,
Merit and conduct both fulfilled.
When the great elixir ripens,
Point the way to Penglai—
Ride a cloud home.

**To Brother Liu of Longevity**
With reverence, I bow,
To Master Liu—
Three years have swiftly passed since we parted.
Often, facing the wind and moon,
I yearn for your noble presence.
Suddenly, your teachings arrive—
Now assured of your well-being.
I rejoice,
No need for formalities—
My thoughts endure.
I regret my worldly ties remain unsevered,
In Ci and Luo, drifting with circumstances.
The promised reunion unfulfilled,
Forgive this old fool’s shortcomings.
Early spring, I shall pay my respects,
By late autumn—
My plain wishes remain unspoken.
I, Chuduan, await
Your profound insights before the altar.

**Six Lyrics to "Man Ting Fang"**
Deceiving to build a household,
Stingy and greedy to amass wealth—
In quiet solitude, I ponder.
Raising those few mouths,
The sins are mine alone.
Time presses like an arrow,
Black hair turns to gray,
Youth fades to age.
In a hundred years,
Who can count them all?
Endlessly striving, in vain.

**If strong in body,**
Awaken early,
Recognize faults, repent swiftly,
Change your ways.
In leisure, carefully
Increase blessings, dispel calamities.
With lofty resolve,
Cast off worldly bonds,
Wander beyond the mundane.
Cultivation is good—
Roam mountains, play in waters,
Daily burn incense in the heart.

**Again**
Mist gathers, clouds disperse,
The autumn moon solitary, still—
Profoundly, the subtle appears.
Ever at ease,
Silently imbibing the elixir.
The precious tripod’s auspicious smoke gathers,
Qi and spirit unite—
The magic fungus forms.
Wander freely,
Drifting as clouds and water,
Beyond the world, seek kindred spirits.

**Follow the Moment**

Fate passes like a fleeting thread—
Hungry, seek your meal;
Wandering, find your shelter.
Let the sun and moon rush on,
Seasons shift, stars realign.
For now, drift at ease in the dust,
Until merit is complete—
Then another master awaits.
When the time comes to return,
A single bright moon
Will walk alone to the Jasper Pool.

**Again**

Ah, this foolish ox,
Stubborn, wild, and crude,
Trampling fields, ravaging crops.
Tighten the nose-rope,
Rein in the blade at once.
Old habits, ignorance’s chaos,
Only whip and strike
Will turn its head at last.
At the point of forgetting,
It lies exhausted on the lonely peak,
Silently, all ties dissolve.

**Gradually Tamed**

Each step now steady,
The goad lies idle,
No thought lingers in the heart.
Roaming clouds and mountains freely,
Singing songs of true delight.
Straw cloak and hat rest by the ancient shore,
A short flute plays
New melodies, drifting and long.
At dusk,
Man and ox return home—
Only the autumn moon remains.

**Again**

Seek not east or west,
Nor search south or north—
The Mysterious True lies within.
Cut all ties at once,
Then spirit and qi harmonize.
Only when your heart is bold,
Raise the sword of wisdom,
Split the darkness of delusion.
Do you yet know?
Let go of all,
And life and nature will round into perfection.

**True Emptiness**

Beyond form and appearance,
In leisure, in stillness,
Slowly, slowly cease all striving.
Content with coarse cloth,
Drifting beyond the world’s dust.
Hungry? Go door to door for rice.
Full? Then bright moon and clear wind.
In freedom,
No more chatter, no more wandering—
Carefree, east or west.

---

**To Marshal Wang of Junzhou**

Moths drawn to lamplight,
Bees craving flower’s nectar—
Ask yourself: what end awaits?
To cultivate the Way,
First escape the storm’s black waves.
With wisdom’s sword, sever all ties,
Leave home, abandon kin.
A wanderer of mist and clouds,
Steps steady on water’s path,
Follow your nature, nurture heaven’s harmony.

**Wear Away**

Shed old sins,
Content with coarse cloth,
Trust the slow grind of time.
Compose poems, sing verses,
Let words flow from tongue and lips.
From ancient times to now, the enlightened
Are no more, no less—
Just themselves.
Of immortals’ tales,
Speak not of Penglai’s isles—
It is like climbing a high slope.

---

**To Zhao the Palace Graduate of Fuchang County**

Confucian learning is noble,
Literary fame brings honor—
Yet life’s path is but vanity and excess.
Toiling heart and will,
Yearning to ascend clouds and mist.
Even if you pass the exams, pluck the osmanthus,
The dream of golden grain
Will wake to sighs.
When impermanence comes,
Even the great like Xiangru and Du Fu—
What escape is there?

**Fleeting Glory**

See through it,
Break free from worldly ties,
Live beyond the dust.
Seek the idle drift of clouds and water,
Nurture the root’s sprout.
When heart is clear and mind is pure,
The Three Lights shine,
Congealing cinnabar.
When merit is complete,
The Three Pure Ones will lift you,
Rising to the Great Luo’s realm.

---

**Four Water Dragon Chants**

To cultivate the supreme bodhi,
Begin at once, without delay.
Let no water cling,
No mud drag,
No trifling bonds entangle.
Life and death—
See them as nothing,
Decide for yourself.
Shed the mortal frame’s filth,
On the misty path,
Lightly, gradually,
Transform all.

Step by step, the cool other shore.
In idle ease,
Forget schemes, cease calculations.
Fire extinguished, smoke dispersed,
Ice congealed, jade formed—
Eternal companions.
Attain true emptiness,
The wondrous mystery unfolds,
Beyond self and other.
When the elixir completes nine cycles,
At the Double Ninth,
We’ll meet again in Penglai’s halls.

**Again**

From the first, a single point arrived,
Fortunate in its pure and gentle form.
Yet love grew, delusion spread,
Obscuring the endless true treasure.
Each person lost,
All to this end—
Chasing passions, aging in vain.
The immortal embryo so easily
Sinks in the bitter sea,
Tossed by waves,
Wasted away.

Awaken swiftly to the wheel’s return,
Reverse the dust-bound heart.
Fire extinguished, smoke dispersed,
Ice congealed, jade formed—
The herb of immortality grows.
Silently, firmly,
Guard your own furnace and cauldron.
Within three thousand merits,
Diligently refine—
The end is certain.

**Again**

The world tells of three islands in the sea,
Hiding herbs of feathered transcendence.
Qin Shi Huang believed it,
Sent Xu Fu eastward
To Penglai’s shores.
Clouds, water, wind, and waves vast—
Men and women in the boats grew old.
Gazing toward the immortal’s source,
Misty waves stretch endlessly,
Heart torn—
When will they arrive?

Pity those lost in delusion,
Futilely stirring up
Empty vexations.
They do not see
The dust of illusion obscures
The true treasure of prior heaven.
Suddenly awaken to worldly ties,
Guard purity, embrace non-action—
The work is done.
When heart is clear and mind is still,
Nature rounds, elixir forms—
Then feast on the immortal herb.

**Again**

Auspicious clouds cradle three peaks,
Where perfected beings descend and transform.
Auspicious mists veil deep
Jade towers, jeweled halls,
Jasper palaces, secluded and profound.
Within ten thousand acres of misty light,
As if descending
Jade springs and lotus waters.
Behold the immortal’s palm—
The crescent moon,
Ever bright,
Flawless.

Green cliffs rise, layer upon layer,
Peaks teem with gibbons’ cries, cranes’ calls.
I come and sigh—
Bound by dust’s reins,
Entangled in love, fame, profit.
Rolling on like flowing waves,
How many can climb?
Now, in the stillness of the Milky Way,
Unmoving,
Become the marrow of yin and yang.

---

**Twenty-One Lyrics to "Ru Meng Ling"**

Mirror and medicine gathered, guard simplicity,
No kindred spirit to speak to.
The ancient mirror must be polished—
Where touched, it shines through.
Joy,
Joy—
A full moon emerges.

**Again**

Bamboo hat, bamboo crown, bamboo bowl,
My daily companions.
Sitting, lying, coming, going—empty,
This is the cool other shore.
Wind’s realm,
Wind’s realm—
The sun and moon’s wheel turns on, heedless.

Only sweep the spirit-terrace again and again,
Cherish your own true treasure.
Within fire, the lotus blooms eternal—
Such is the mystery of cultivation’s arcana.
Upside-down,
Upside-down—
When realms vanish and mind is forgotten, all is clarity.

**Again**

A wisp of numinous emptiness for company,
Sever the bonds of desire and passion.
As the sun ascends, refine the void,
Abide forever in the ancient shrine of the spirit-hall.
Wind’s realm,
Wind’s realm—
Beyond this, no other means exists.

**Again**

Attend to the skin-sack as your portion allows,
Whether sitting, lying, coming, or going—lucid and free.
Roam joyfully through the world’s scenes,
Unburdened by even a wisp of birth’s entanglements.
Endure,
Endure—
Claim the carefree and unbound.

**Again**

Roaming beyond the mundane, carefree and untrammeled,
Each step treads on cool clouds’ trailing skirts.
In leisure, play with the void,
Another tryst awaits in Penglai’s isles.
Observe,
Observe—
Strip away the fine threads of human sentiment.

**Again**

The Great Dao is nameless, beyond speech,
Cast aside vain distinctions and delusions.
When fire fades and smoke disperses,
That is the fairest season, the finest hour.
Embrace simplicity,
Embrace simplicity—
Recognize the spring blossoms, the autumn moon.

**Again**

The Great Dao’s root returns to the plain,
Cutting away all human cares and cogitations.
When fire fades and smoke disperses,
Recognize the primordial yang gathered and secured.
Thus act,
Thus act—
This is the swiftest path to long life.

**Again**

Through encountering Master Chongyang,
I was led into the gate of the Complete Perfection.
Wisdom’s fire tempers the numinous void,
Daring not take a single step astray.
One step,
One step—
Each step draws nearer than the last.

**Again**

In purity and non-action, penetrate to the utmost,
Let no high or low distinctions arise.
Extinguish the hearts of self and others,
And the true master will lift you.
Lift you,
Lift you—
Clouds part to reveal the moon in every home.

**Again**

In daily practice, wash away dust and grime,
Seize and bind the monkey and horse to keep them from straying.
With hands outstretched before the street,
Guard the One without yielding to greed or scheming.
Greed and scheming,
Greed and scheming—
How then shall merit be perfected and the Way achieved?

**Again**

Unstained by worldly passions, not out of pride,
Nor scorning the poor to chase the rich.
Dare not accept others’ reverence,
But roam free as clouds and waters.
Clouds and waters,
Clouds and waters—
Guard the One, in non-action to the core.

**Again**

Do not marvel that brothers do not pant,
Only that worldly ties grow distant.
Dare not accept others’ reverence,
Nor delight in fine robes or lavish feasts.
Unfurl,
Unfurl—
Temper the cinnabar through nine transformations.

**Again**

A carefree old man, unbound and wandering,
Roaming free and at ease.
One day he returns to his mountain home,
To reunite with cloud companions and rosy friends.
Dear friends,
Dear friends—
Together they drink the peach nectar of immortals.

**Again**

In daily practice, the numinous light is sealed within,
Preserving the true heart from ruin.
Gold and jade congeal and settle,
So that birth and death cannot approach me.
Merit’s fruit,
Merit’s fruit—
Returning alone, bearing clouds in hand.

**To Daoist Friend Wang Silang of Junzhou**

A message for the Daoist friends of Junzhou:
Do not cling to the fleeting blossoms of passion.
Best to follow Master Tan’s wind,
Preserving the body from decay.
Undecaying,
Undecaying—
Together we drink the immortal wine of long life.

**To the Third Aunt of the Wang San Commissioner’s Residence**

To cultivate amidst the worldly,
First extinguish the distinctions of self and others.
In softness and humility, guard poverty,
Unwavering in resolve from beginning to end.
True goodness,
True goodness—
Diminish the self to benefit others with ease.

**To Jia Xin of Xiuwu, a Practitioner of the Dao**

Master Jia, a practitioner of the Dao,
In daily life holds his heart low.
To see the original true,
In stillness seize the monkey and catch the horse.
Seize and play,
Seize and play—
Must follow Master Tan’s path to mute the throat.

**To Daoist Friends Zhang and Li**

Alas, this floating life is brief,
Yet all are lost in qi, wealth, lust, and wine.
If awakened to forsake worldly ties,
Together we may bind cloud companions and rosy friends.
Dear friends,
Dear friends—
Preserve the body from decay.

**To the Wine Merchant of Wenxiang County**

Deeply fond of Master Jia’s auspicious goodness,
Wandering through water and clouds with mysterious ease.
One day, abiding in non-action,
He will witness the tiger and dragon in battle.
In battle,
In battle—
The elixir congeals, forever dispelling the thousand changes.

**Expressing My Feelings**

A single spark of spirit-light never dims,
Moving in and out, coming and going without hindrance.
Everywhere it manifests as perfect clarity,
In every thing and every head, all responds with understanding.
Be patient,
Be patient—
No misfortune can ever invade.

**Eight Poems to the Tune of "Moon over the West River"**

My servitude arises from heart and will,
Wash away the mysteries of prajna.
No need to labor east or west, north or south—
A tiny inch of the square heart is all.
The precious mirror, veiled in dust,
Must be polished to gleam.
A single point of light illumines non-action,
Straight into Penglai’s hidden depths.

Again,
Seek not the Dao outside,
The spiritual sprout springs from the heart’s field.
Plow deep with the iron ox to see the root,
All lies in diligent refinement.
Recognize the original face of the moon,
Hold the body upright, let no deviation sway.
Draw the six-grave bow taut and round,
Each arrow strikes the red heart with proof.

Again,
Sudden awakening breaks the cycle to enter the Dao,
Through ceaseless refinement in the midst of time.
Preserve and diminish with utmost devotion,
To escape future transmigration.
Fire extinguished, the five-petaled lotus blooms,
Smoke dispersed, jade congeals in the three fields.
Desiring to transcend the supreme, leave behind gods and men,
Fathom the ancient hall of emptiness.

Again,
To enter the gate of Perfect Truth,
In movement, stillness, sitting, lying—all is desolate quiet.
With heart set on alms, pass through the world’s court,
Laying aside every worldly affair.
Speak not of yellow sprouts or white snow,
Seek not dragon, tiger, infant, or maiden.
Free from attachment to form and wealth, the fire and smoke vanish—
Then you are on Penglai’s three isles.

Again,
Alas, how swiftly time flies,
Each day brings thoughts and worries.
Foolishly content to drift like passing waves,
Bewitched by qi, wealth, lust, and wine.
Sun and moon silently hasten man’s aging,
Fame and profit never let the heart rest.
How much better to lay all down and gaze at the mountain’s peak—
The bright moon belongs to every household.

Again,
After cold, add a layer of paper or cloth,
When hungry, stretch out your hand to beg in the streets.
Cold porridge and stale rice suffice for a meal,
Gentle poverty keeps harm at bay.
All misfortune arises from the heart,
With no heart, there is no misfortune, no disaster.
Once the heart is settled, guard the true embryo,
Wandering clouds and water, carefree and at ease.

Again,
After cold, add a layer of paper or cloth,
When hungry, beg for scraps.
Wild at heart, gladly accepting the coarse and simple,
Just enough to cover the body and fill the belly.
I sigh at my own foolishness,
Vainly setting up remedies to guard against restraint.
From now on, lay all down and delight in pure emptiness,
Become a simple, carefree old man.

Again,
To practice with companions is not yet the way,
Wander beyond the world, holding fast.
Like a solitary cloud or wild crane, drift east or west,
Without the slightest hindrance.
Seek two simple meals a day,
Pure and clean, in non-action.
Desolate quiet and free ease are most fitting—
There is another kind of savor.

**Two Poems to the Tune of "Incense Procession"**

Attaining without cultivation,
No delusion, no seeking.
Let the heart be at leisure—
No joy, no sorrow.
Carefree and at ease,
Wandering clouds and water.
Delving into the mysterious within emptiness,
The wondrous within the mysterious,
The secluded within the wondrous.

Fallen and dissolute,
Face grimy, hair disheveled.
Blissfully drunk,
Singing songs of true joy.
Content with whatever comes, truly refined.
This way comes non-being,
Non-being comes being,
Being comes from reason.

Again,
Morning, guard the heart,
Evening, guard the heart.
Fear the heart’s arising,
Lest familiar scenes invade.
Many skills and arts—
Calligraphy, painting, chess, zither—
No longer give rise to greed,
No longer cling to love,
Step onto the jade peak.
Good arises from the heart,
Evil arises from the heart.
With the heart at ease, evil intentions wildly seek.
The heart born, time passes in vain,
Days and months like flowing clouds,
Like departing water,
Seek a knowing friend.

**Three Poems to the Tune of "Clouds and Mist Gather"**

Hide your brilliance,
Feign foolishness.
Dully, drowsily,
Stroll idly in leisure.
Face grimy, hair disheveled, clothes in tatters.
Begging without shame,
Only then are you a companion of mist and clouds.

Abandon pride,
Pursue truth and simplicity.
Seek no admiration,
Nor choose lowly or humble places.
Recognize the true words of Master Danyang.
Clear and awake,
When merit is complete, return to Penglai’s path.

Again,
Engage in practice,
Do not slight it.
Recognize the rain in the clouds,
Fine and clear.
The pure, cool spiritual sprout emerges.
Seeking outside the heart,
Vainly exhausts effort in futility.
Sitting and walking,
Lying and abiding,
Leisurely search in leisure,
Leisurely act in freedom.
The golden flower blooms, opening the jade door.
A single path of light
Shines straight onto the road of non-action.

Again,

To the wayfarer, lend an ear and hear my brief plea.
Donning the false to seek the true—best turn your gaze back.
Examine your conduct and intent; cast off longing for the old.
If not aligned with emptiness,
How dwell in Penglai’s isles?

Recognize the primal origin, return to purity and simplicity.
Diligently polish the spirit’s terrace,
Let no dust or grime defile it.
Banish greed, wrath, and delusion from the heart.
In hidden depths, merit ripens—
A true master emerges to guide you.

*Linjiang Xian* (Three Poems)

Ah, the wondrous truth of the Perfect Real:
No striving, no doing, no cultivation.
Naturally pure, the work of practice complete.
Auspicious clouds encircle crimson gates,
Auspicious qi swirls around jade towers.

The heart like idle clouds, unobstructed,
The body like a ferryboat moored at an ancient ford.
The true void’s boundless realm may be met.
A white ox sleeps on dew-kissed earth,
A bright moon illumines the mountain’s peak.

Again,
Illusory blossoms of fleeting life—cease clinging in vain.
The Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper shift endlessly.
In darkness, raven locks turn to silver threads.
A hundred years pass like a dream,
Seventy years have ever been rare.

I urge all to awaken and reflect:
Who knows when the wheel of rebirth’s limit will come?
Cultivation is timely now, not later.
The sins of past wrongs—
To escape them, hasten your practice.

Again,
I bow to all Daoist companions of my gate:
Subdue the heart, cease seeking outward.
Time slips by so easily, so carelessly wasted.
What is true cultivation?
Nothing but the settling of this human heart.

Extinguish the three fires of ignorance’s karmic roots,
Let no external realm encroach.
Originally, not a speck rises or sinks.
Attain true leisure, and with each step,
Ascend the lofty peaks.

*Lianli Zhi*

Foolish folk of this fleeting world,
Ever chasing fame and profit.
Love’s ocean, kindness’ mountain—
Entanglements that bind and delude:
Wine, lust, wealth, and pride.

Count glory and riches as lightning’s flash—
Better turn the heart and repent.
Seek liberation early,
Silently probe the mysteries.
In quietude and poverty, in leisure,
Pass the days as the Daoist’s livelihood.
Uphold the non-active, pure practice,
Complete the work’s cycle—
Then attend the Jade Pool’s banquet.

To the Honorable An, Jieyuan of Jingzhao Prefecture, and Lord Taiyuan in his illness:
Hear my earnest words.

The sages and worthies await to lift you up—
Best to rest now.
Count a human life: seventy years,
As the ancients said, rare indeed.
When you reach that point,
Make the resolute choice to lay all down.
Sever the ties that drag,
Turn toward leisure’s ease,
Return to purity’s simplicity,
Abide in tranquil nurturance of the unskilled.
Recognize the numinous source,
Temper and polish it to clarity.
All past karmic obstructions,
Within the merit of three thousand deeds,
Will gradually dissolve and vanish.
Green mountains, blue waters—
Five companions share the wind and moon’s delight.

*Caisangzi*

To Dharma Master Wang of Huojia:
Talks of wind—how he favors his father, Wang the Third,
A bond from past lives.
No more delay.
Wife’s scorn, children’s disdain—leave the worldly abode.
In cultivation, outwardly practice non-action,
Imprison the horse, capture the monkey.
Do not return to the home garden,
And you shall surely become a carefree immortal beyond the material world.

*Moshanxi, Two Poems*

In cultivation and refinement,
Seek not the infant and the maiden.
Recognize the original root at the beginning,
Rise from the dust—
Must remove, must not cling.
Always abide in right awakening,
Meet each encounter with discernment.
Cut off human sentiments,
Depart from clamor and noise,
Abandon all worldly affairs one by one.
Walk the long path with ease,
In leisure, harmonize the provisional.
Within emptiness, engage in true cultivation,
So clear, so cool, so free.
At midday, still and diminished,
Truly merge with the void and nothingness.
Delight in carefree wandering,
Turn toward leisure’s ease,
Step by step, enter the realm of no-birth.

Again:
Amid the dust, toiling and bustling,
Chasing hollow fame and profit.
No more such bitter labor of the heart,
Ever petty, ever harming spirit and qi.
Turn your head—it is old age.
Awaken, and withdraw at once.
Cast off glory, sever wealth and lust,
Find joy in the Dao, transcend the floating world.
Kindness and love’s entanglements,
Like fish playing in a cauldron.
No more debate on early cultivation—
Why postpone one day after another?
The poet’s gentle admonition,
Soft words shatter delusion and folly.
Act early, swiftly proceed,
Make plans for the journey ahead.

*Qingyuan Case: Urging the Horse*

The true master guides onto the path of cultivation,
Silent, wordless phrases.
Slowly, steadily refine and return to true simplicity.
Each reflection turned inward dissolves into emptiness—
The horse awakens.
Within and without, verified,
No dusty concerns remain.
Truly pure, truly clear, enter the true place,
Carefully search for the wondrous, mysterious joy.
See through fleeting splendor, embrace the clear and void.
The demon-subduing sword severs karmic ties—
The horse is liberated.
Step by step, enter the gate of eternal life.

*Ruanlangui, Two Poems*

**On Tea**

At yin-yang’s first union, a thunderclap—
The sacred sprout unfurls in delicate grace.
The jade-like artisan crafts with subtle art,
Boiling, snow-white waves take flight.

Eyes of Dao-seeing,
Awakening from stupor,
Bitter within, sweetness most rare.
Do you yet know that trace of true flavor?
Alone, you return through mist and cloud.

---

**Again**

Leisurely, cloud and water drift east and west,
A wisp of spirit follows, free and light.
Drowsy, silent, it soars to and fro—
The journey ahead is already known.

The true Great Dao,
Beyond the dust’s mechanism,
Detached from all things, one by one.
Chongyang grants me the white ox—
Now, who is this?

---

**Three *Busuanzi***

The Four Great Causes compose,
Crossing the bitter sea by boat.
A gust of pure wind reaches the shore—
Ascend the path of no rebirth.

People sigh at poverty’s hardship,
I tread the path of carefree ease.
Embodiment shed, utterly empty, not a coin—
Yet richer than Shi Chong’s wealth.

---

**Again**

Since entering the gate of mystery,
I dwell in stillness, clarity, and void.
In quietude, I search the Four False Forms,
Seeing through the dusty road of existence.

Awakening upon awakening,
Attaining true leisure’s delight.
I gather the priceless truth within—
How could I chase after worldly favor?

---

**Again**

A madman at ease,
Crossing to the other shore by divine boat.
Ten thousand miles of cloudless sky,
Moonlight illumines the Cao Creek path.

Severing the bitterness of karmic ties,
Silently, I fathom the mystery’s joy.
Let others laugh at my poverty—
Within, I am boundlessly rich.

---

**Five *Qinyuan Chun* by Changzhenzi Tan Chuduan of Kunlun Mountain**

Desire knows no bounds,
This limited form—
Why exhaust yourself in vain?
These karmic ties bring
Sons and daughters,
Their own food and clothing,
Each following their fate.
Vain scheming, empty calculations—
When the great limit arrives, who will stand for you?
You must awaken,
Withdraw early beyond the world’s dust,
And gain advantage.

Procrastination—even now, the hand moves too slow.
Never wander afar in search of subtleties.
Where the dust-heart stirs,
All is demonic delusion.
Yet the original, primordial essence remains—
Refine and dispel the stupor.

True stillness, true compassion,
Mysterious waves wash clean,
Abiding in carefree, boundless realms.
A thousand ages hence,
A single point within the spirit-terrace
Shines with the light of non-action.

---

**Again**

Illusion, vanity,
A hundred years of light—
A sigh, a single instant.
Futile, this bustling toil,
Striving for fame and profit,
Wealth and honor—
How much can you grasp?
Mirage towers, rainbow bridges,
A fleeting moment—can it last?
Hearken while strong,
Escape the seething bitter sea,
Swiftly climb the high slope.

Wisdom, do not delay.
All worldly affairs are empty—
Let the body pass unscathed.
Recognize the original, primordial treasure,
Tarnished by dust, slowly polish it clean.
Nurture the sacred root,
Water it ceaselessly—
Amid the waters, golden blossoms bear jade branches.
Beyond birth and death,
This original point,
Neither more nor less.

---

**Again**

How pointless—
This endless chase of fame and profit,
When will it end?
Wealth, honor, high rank,
Fair wives, lovely daughters—
Who would persist in cultivation?
The cold, austere gate of mystery,
The clear, wondrous Dao—
Bitter and harsh, who would remain?
On the path of practice,
Awaken to the cycle of birth and death—
Only then may one join the immortal stream.

Cast off all idle sorrows,
Sever karmic ties at once.
Don the blue kerchief, plain robes,
Live by fate’s decree,
Wander carefree beyond the world.
In leisure, seek leisure,
Reduce and reduce again,
Fire extinguished, smoke vanished—no outward seeking.
When you depart,
The road to Fengdu transforms
Into Penglai’s isles.

---

**Again**

From ancient times, wise and foolish alike,
The turning sun and moon
All sink into the yellow springs.
Alas, Zhang and Chen, their bonds of loyalty severed
For fame and profit,
The extravagant Later Lord,
Who ruined his homeland.
By the Jiang of Chu’s temple,
Near the Han’s imperial tombs,
Power exhausted, all returns to emptiness.
Heroes of the age,
All leave behind crumbling mounds,
Weeds stretching endlessly.

Alas! The past is pitiable,
Clinging to illusion, chasing fleeting vanities.
Why not awaken,
Abandon the toil of dust and dreams,
Embrace poverty’s leisure, return to simplicity,
Refine the cinnabar field?
Cross beyond the cycle of rebirth,
Rise above the bitter sea,
Board the cool, prajna boat.
On the carefree shore,
Meet the jade path of mystery’s friends,
Together seek the Peach Blossom Spring.

---

**Again**

Swiftly, time passes,
The Four Greats float in emptiness,
Right and wrong long entrenched.
Who can preserve this cycle?
From dawn to dusk, ensnared,
Family ties, love’s bonds,
Delaying, entangling.
A single true spirit,
Through a thousand lives, ten thousand kalpas,
Drifts in the bitter sea, bound to karmic chains.
You must awaken,
In your own household, be bold,
Contend for life and death.

Wisdom, heed these subtle words,
Lay down idle sorrows,
Search the wondrous mystery.
Recognize poverty’s leisure, stillness,
Cease harsh judgments,
Bring forth the original, primordial point,
Fresh and new.
Upright, selfless,
Ever practicing equality,
Unfettered, carefree, follow nature.
True merit and practice,
In leisure, slowly,
Accumulate into thousands.

---

**Two *Wang Hai Chao***

The Great Dao of Quanzhen,
Non-action, purity—
Yet layer upon layer, obstacles to sigh over.
Often lamenting my own karma,
Drawn irresistibly,
Wandering cloud and water, drifting aimlessly.
Free from thoughts, beyond slander and heresy,
I wish all would awaken early,
Hasten past the fleeting splendor.
The Dao’s Ancestor ascended west—
Even then, he avoided the flowing sands.

Return to the earth’s lungs, the immortal’s home.
Meet cloud companions, radiant friends,
Boundless true joy.
In the empty hall, feasting,
Peaches of immortality in riotous bloom,
Jade cups brimming with flowing霞.
All seated, adorned with jasper blossoms.
Attaining the profound, profound union,
A single grain of cinnabar.
At this moment, merit complete, practice fulfilled,
Together we sail the cloud raft.

---

**Again**

Alas, this floating world—
Who can awaken?
Each person, shrouded in mundane illusions.
Faces wither day by day,
Yet still they toil in suffering,
Greedily clinging to love’s infants.
The sea of desire’s waves stretch far.
Driven by the two wheels,
Hair soon frosts with silver.
Suddenly, impermanence arrives—
What logic can escape its grasp?

How much better to awaken swiftly and cast off the household,
Severing all dust-bound ties, within firming the root-sprout.
Three thousand secret essentials, eight hundred hidden merits,
Refining conduct with unwavering sincerity.
Treading cloud and water through mist and radiance,
Recognizing the true splendor of the Three Lights,
Congealing cinnabar’s elixir.
One day, merit complete, you shall depart—
Sailing the Numinous Raft between Ox and Dipper.

Freely roaming,
I cherish poverty’s leisure, idly coming and going.
Simple, untroubled, free of calamity,
Cold gruel and stale rice, no smoke nor fire,
Eating a plateful—just enough to warm the belly.
Others’ rights and wrongs matter not to me,
For I have seen through worldly affairs.
Drifting, carefree, following conditions as they come,
Freely roaming in dwelling, walking, sitting, lying.

*Two Southern Branch Songs*

Frequently trimming the candle of luminous clarity,
Diligently honing the blade of wisdom.
Ten thousand entanglements cut away, not a thread remains,
Tempering from the primal origin—spare no effort to the end.
Radiance soars above water’s depths,
Snowy waves cast from mountain peaks.
Tiger and dragon coil round the crucible,
Forging the immortal elixir,
Step by step ascending the azure heavens.

Again—
Clouds drift, the southern mountains grow still,
Wind comes, the Wei River turns cold.
Walking the waves, congealing into a single mass,
Gazing across ten thousand miles of clear sky,
So crisp and bright in this moment.
The hero’s sword rings as it leaves the scabbard,
A head rolls onto the jade platter.
A bright moon climbs the balustrade—
Only then, from this point on,
Does the heart-mind find true ease.

*Oriole’s Song*

**Living Ghosts**

Living ghosts, living ghosts—
day after day in the marketplace,
contending for fame, scrambling for gain,
clinging to fair maidens, darling sons,
casting aside the root and source.
Too late to seek deliverance,
what recourse when the final hour comes?
You’ll have no share in heaven’s ascent,
but fate will drag you down to earth.

*Bodhisattva Barbarian*

Where the blade of wisdom swings, heads roll,
rainbow light surges through the clouds’ feet.
My human heart extinguished—
why seek beyond?

White lotus blooms within fire,
dharma-endurance transcends life and death.
Patience and shame both void,
tortoise-hair and hare-horn the same.

---

**Auspicious Partridge (Eleven Songs)**

In cultivation, seek not the tiger-dragon child,
only the luminous clarity that knows the primal mechanism.
Dulled, Amitābha becomes an outer thief;
awakened, affliction is bodhi.

Constantly examine your own faults—mind grows bright;
only seeing others’ wrongs—nature turns deluded.
Shatter every bond, then rest—
in the empty hall, companion to the Muni.

---

Again—
In cultivation, seek not the tiger-dragon child,
fire extinguished, smoke dispersed, wealth and desire left behind.
Within, refine qi and spirit to ninefold transmutation;
without, purge impurities, expel the Three Corpses.

Dwell in stillness, speak not of others’ faults;
abide in purity, search only your own transgressions.
Keep the spiritual root unobstructed—
naturally, you’ll realize the fruit of buddhahood.

---

Again—
In cultivation, frequently trim the lamp within your nature,
illuminating the long-darkened gloom.
Let go of every attachment, every thing—
dull and silent, words cease.

Transcending the mundane to enter sageliness is not by my doing;
hell and heaven lie entirely within you.
Only one true path remains—
dwell always, firmly sealing the four city gates.

---

Again—
Each pursues the Dao, yet craves rank flesh,
drunk on wine, infatuated with flowers, bound by sin.
The heart’s craving for flesh harms living beings;
the mind’s greed for love erodes the root.

Boasting of medicinal arts, claiming mastery,
who believes in the golden precepts’ secret mystery?
When you awaken to emptiness, rest—
lay it all down and cultivate immortality.

---

Again—
Cultivate the heart like cold ashes,
release delusion, greed, anger, desire, wealth.
How can self and other yield the fruit of the Dao?
How can right and wrong give birth to the true embryo?

When ignorance is extinguished, ascend the golden palace;
when passions and desires are forgotten, bow at the jade steps.
Refinement must end in smoke and fire’s demise—
for where the heart is low, Penglai appears.

---

Again—
The original true nature is the mystery’s mechanism,
grasped only in luminous clarity’s awakening.
Fire extinguished, smoke dispersed—the great medicine forms;
realms forgotten, mind exhausted—bodhi appears.

Leisurely stillness is the true immortal’s path,
solitude and non-action the ladder from the world.
Not a single dharma arises, no obstructions—
cultivation is only this.

---

Again—
In cultivation, sing the falling-flower lotus,
diminish and diminish, idle and idle, follow nature.
When the sun rises, speak not of others’ faults;
throughout the day, frequently correct your own bias.

Do not stray from the square inch to seek the elixir;
do not wander outside to find the wondrous mystery.
Keep the spirit-terrace empty of all things—
then the ninefold transmutation births the embryonic immortal.

---

Again—
Cultivation is neither easy nor hard,
responding to things with compassion, recognizing inner stillness.
Where the mind harbors dust, mountains become markets;
where the heart holds no affairs, markets become mountains.

Constantly till three plots of pure fields,
steadfastly guard one chamber of non-action.
Earth endures, heaven lasts—devote yourself to one aim,
and naturally the purple-golden elixir coalesces.

---

Again—
Do not say cultivation is easy to uphold,
diminishing and preserving, fearing hindrance and conflict.

Again—
Two meals—beware lest they encroach upon Dao-friends;
a single coin—fear it may harm the realm of mystery.
Among crowds, guard your speech and forget pride;
in solitude, rein in the mind and halt its gallop.
Through the twelve hours, constantly turn the light inward,
still doubting whether hidden scrutiny reveals selflessness.

To Master Wang of Yun’an:
Master Wang, secluded in deep retreat, dines on fine fare,
protecting the numinous root and guarding inner stillness.
Where emotion lingers, mountains become markets;
where desire is absent, markets become mountains.
Nurture the spirit with constant warmth,
and when qi-refinement is complete, repel heat and cold.
Unwavering from start to finish,
naturally the precious *langgan* coalesces.

To Master Guo:
Still the heart, reduce affairs to nourish the root-source,
abiding in tranquil emptiness and guarding the natural.
Accumulate virtue and benevolent influence, following Confucius and Mencius;
seek seclusion and lofty purity, emulating Yan and Yuan.
In samādhi, gaze upon the bright moon of a mid-autumn night;
in wondrous subtlety, feel the mysterious breeze of a ninth-month summer.
Who can match the lute, poetry, wine, and books?
This rustic fellow often resembles a dragon in slumber.

Gazing Toward Penglai, Five Poems:

The true Great Dao—
diminish and diminish in cultivation.
Wherever you go, people revere and offer sustenance,
yet gaining advantage is but losing advantage,
step by step sinking into the mire.

For the impoverished man—
abide in tranquility, do not stray.
Outwardly, let your demeanor inspire awe;
inwardly, silently gather the numinous fungus.
Soon you will meet your master’s appointed time.

Again—

Hear this counsel—
few matters need the lord’s attention.
Striving endlessly for all things harms only yourself;
gaining advantage is but losing advantage.
Cleverness cannot compare to simplicity.

In true cultivation,
seek nothing beyond the heart.
Only the present moment lies before your eyes;
naturally, vexations will not follow.
Step by step, enter non-action.

Again—

Walk the Great Dao,
recognize Kan and Li.
At the inverted point where the single spark arises,
twofold signs reveal their secrets.
The mystery is not hard to know.

Seek not without—
awaken to your own bodhi.
Within the body of form, refine through tempering;
on the path of non-action, realize the Muni.
Soon you will mount the clouds.

Again—

The wondrous perfection of the Complete Truth—
no self, no others.
No action, no striving, beyond sight and sound,
humble, gentle, and yielding, without estrangement.
In solitude, uphold pure poverty.

In the profoundest depths,
each attainment is a fine cause.
The single spark of non-arising is true freedom;
serene and ever still, originally real.
When merit is full, join the immortals’ ranks.

Again—

Perpetual Truth’s Child,
daily turns in ceaseless seeking.
Follow your lot, follow conditions to dissolve past karma;
idle sorrows and idle vexations all cease at once.
The bright moon shines over the mountain’s peak.

Ever clear and still,
no attainment, no cultivation.
Free, beyond the bounds of cause and effect,
carefree and transcendent, escape the sinking stream.
When merit is full, reach Penglai’s shores.

Three Poems on the Flower-Strewn Path

Through the master’s grace, I crossed the bitter sea,
left the worldly to explore the profound mystery.
Suddenly dwelling in the land of joy,
I recognized poverty as leisure’s way.
Right and wrong, self and others—
what matter wise or foolish?
Step by step on the cool, clear path,
trusting in free wandering,
who knows such serenity?
No heart to gaze afar at immortals—
when the time comes, follow conditions as they flow.

Yao’s reign brought harvests rich and full,
thanks to august Heaven.
Water and clouds my livelihood,
seeking but a single coin.
Diminishing, ever at ease in idleness,
silent and without striving,
letting years and months stretch on unbroken.

Again—

As the Double Ninth arrives,
clouds and waters drift to the edge of the sky.
Dao-friends invite me to drink,
admiring the yellow chrysanthemums.
Especially for this refined gathering,
gazing south toward emerald mists and rosy clouds.
Eyes straining through the mountain haze,
dimly discerned in the distance—
immortal dwellings deep in auspicious clouds.
Freely, merrily, drinking and reveling,
laughter and boasts rise like leaping fish.
Before the goblet, only wine brings joy—
what more could one desire?
Floating gold ripples,
silently gathering the numinous blossom.
Drinking done, yet urged again,
no return until drunk,
as the bright moon first climbs the window gauze.

Again—

Above, no tiled roof of three,
below, not a plow’s worth of land.

A true livelihood of water and clouds—
just follow conditions as they come.
Hands outstretched in the street,
alms sought from those with karmic affinity.
This "affinity" bears the hidden meaning.

Returning alone at dusk,
ten thousand miles of cloudless sky—
lying down to hear tigers roar and apes cry.
Leisurely, at ease, boundless true joy,
a surging spring of numinous qi.

The true fire descends in the crucible,
eternally congealing the lead.
Tiger and dragon coil and entwine,
true essence rooting in the source.

Sitting in silent non-action,
alone guarding the solitary peak—
a single bright moon flows across the heavens.

*Five "Pounding Silk" Songs*

*Pounding Silk*—
what does it hold?
Past sins and karmic debts
slowly ground away.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*
From the first attainment,
recognizing *pāramitā*.
Sense pleasures and wealth shattered—
like moths to a flame.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*

Again—

Listen to the explanation,
this "wind brother."
Usually just so much *luoli luo*.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*
A few words—
no need for more.
When the wise understand,
they laugh *hehe*.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*

The pure Dharma transcends the mundane,
the divine vessel steadily ferries across sinking waves.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*
Act swiftly,
emerge from the river of delusion.
If they still do not awaken,
time slips by in vain.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*

Again—

Fleeting glory,
a dream in Nanke.
Years flash like lightning,
rolling down the wheel’s slope.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*
Break free early,
escape the whirlpool.
Sun and moon race like shuttles,
two losses in a row.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*

Again—

The wind-borne singer chants,
a song to shatter delusion.
Turn your heart—
meet Maitreya with me.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*
Ten *Pounding Silk* songs,
must harmonize.
Kindness, love, and desire—
these are the demons of enmity.
*Luoli suo, lisuo luo.*

*Three "Han Palace Spring" Songs*

In the *jiazi* celestial cycle,
under a radiant imperial age,
immortals descend to the world.
The immortal master secretly dispatched me,
thus I journeyed east through mist and waves.
Mountains distant, roads far,
crossings arduous—how could I refuse the long trek?
Only this念念:
each person yet unenlightened,
vainly clinging to household schemes.

The wheel of rebirth is bitter—
awaken and reflect.
Observe the ancients’ methods,
how they broke free.
Sever worldly ties,
gradually drawing near the profound Dao.
With merit complete and qi congealed,
soon the body ascends to immortality.
Returning thereafter,
phoenix and crane guide me
to the true assembly of Penglai.

Again—

Seeking the wuwei,
delighting in leisure within leisure,
just this little remains.
Focus on the present—
past and future, let them be.
Walk always in openness,
far from wealth and desire,
from human right and wrong.
Recently thus,
inner joy untroubled,
not a thread of attachment to the world.

Drowsy and silent—
yet within the formless,
grasp the true root.
Lucid and free,
no use, no action, no holding.
Everywhere turning back to reflect,
naturally the principle shines,
radiant in every encounter.
Who understands?
The clear wind and bright moon—
only two people know their depth.

Again—

Admiring poverty and leisure,
I tempered strength, blunted sharpness,
embraced softness and harmony.
Worldly ties suddenly cast off,
the lamp of wisdom brightly lit the spirit-chamber.
The seven gates turned inward,
adorned with seven treasures,
secretly arrayed.
Taming the ape and horse,
cunning and cleverness arise—
refine them into another path.

Guard purity and spontaneity,
abide in wuwei, ever good,
a single stick of heart-incense.
In peace and joy,
jade liquid flows in jeweled cups.
Cloud companions, rosy friends,
laughing and clamoring,
gold and jade chiming.
When people depart,
clouds disperse, mist clears—
the limpid moon fills the empty hall.

*Nine "Longing for Immortals" (Longing Everlasting) Songs*

Dawn longs for immortals,
dusk longs for immortals,
yearning for the true master four or five years.
Only fearing merit incomplete.

Merit must be complete,
conduct must be complete,
merit and conduct both perfected—
a great immortal.
Carrying clouds, returning to the grotto-heaven.

Again—

The mind races outward—
painful whips in hand,
yet with tempered nature, the path is never lost.
By fragrant streams, lush grasses thrive.

The thorn returns,
the ox follows,
as the bright moon hangs high, illuminating the ancient dyke.
When neither man nor ox is seen.

Again—

Gold must be plentiful,
silver must be plentiful,
and the toil of servants, horses, and fields—all must be plentiful.
Yet at departure, karmic debts grow heavier still.

What of poverty?
What of wealth?
With a heart untouched by all things, what then?
What can the future do to me?

Again—

The Daoist’s heart—
dwells in no-heart,
a carefree, unfettered, pure and tranquil heart.
A drifting, cloud-and-water heart.

The heart for fame and gain,
the heart of endless greed,
day and night tormented, enslaved—
when will it ever rest?

Again—

The heart of cultivation,
the heart of forbearance,
a single expanse of cold, empty detachment.
A leisurely, useless heart.

The heart of wrath extinguished,
the heart of desire cast away,
solitude and poverty align with the sage’s heart.
The unborn reveals the original heart.

Again—

Fair as blossoms in bloom,
do not wait for fragrance to scatter with the evening wind.
Only at the end is emptiness realized.

Profoundly search,
break free from the mundane cage,
with fierce resolve, burn all to ash—rise as a world-transcending hero.
When merit is complete, ascend the Three Isles’ peaks.

Again—

Encountering the wind immortal,
receiving the hidden teaching,
like tumbleweed on clouds and water, ever at ease.
The numinous brightness reveals the original source.

Refine true lead,
irrigate the pure spring—
know that within the gourd lies another heaven.
Attain carefree serenity.

Obtaining return to nothingness,
merging with emptiness—
still and limpid, as if not there.
From the primordial beginning, nothing more.

Principles clarified, emptiness realized,
a single numinous source truly like void.
Radiance pierces the great void.

Again—

Attaining the profound mystery,
awakening to the Three-in-Three,
fire extinguished, smoke dispersed—wind’s harm silenced.
In serene obscurity, preserve the Jade Lad.

Pursue leisurely ease,
recognize pure simplicity—
one nature wholly like the moon at due south.
Limpid, the azure pool appears.

*Remembering the Prince—Seven Poems*

The divine boat steadies its course through dark currents,
bright moon’s glow—destiny fulfills itself.
Two masters nod in silent accord.
There is reason:
ten thousand kalpas of rebirth end here.

Again—

Who truly masters the heart’s submission?
The crimson phoenix drives it to drink from jade rivers.
Guiding the infant, laughing, they dance as one.
Trimming the silver lamp,
each thing reveals itself at dawn’s window.

Again—

From the first attainment, grace flows freely,
taming tortoise and snake to dwell in stillness.
A thousand days—elixir complete, forever secured.
What fine cause!
Carefree and at ease, all affairs cease.

Again—

Heart free of affairs, qi and spirit harmonize,
unaware, joyful words overflow.
The sword of Dao-steel, ground ever finer.
Wind’s harm, brother—
cut out the tongue, drive the demons away.

Again—

Worldly dust clings with wealth and desire’s suffering,
love of fleeting splendor enslaves this body.
Awaken to the numinous source’s single truth.
Cut off greed and wrath—
then you are one who has reached the shore’s freedom.

Again—

Nothing, nothing—no, there is something, yet nothing,
awakening to nothingness, one is no longer foolish.
Days, months, years wear away the coarse and strong.
Behold the primordial beginning—
ten thousand rays of rosy light gather the jewel.

Again—

Vast, the bitter sea stretches boundless,
endless deluded fish sink into black abyss.
I cast a golden hook to catch the destined.
The destined are drawn—
led aboard the divine boat to pluck jade lotuses.

*Six Poems to the Tune of "Magnolia with Reduced Characters"*

The gate of Complete Reality,
still and pure, without contrivance.
Neither easy nor hard—
wealth, desire, and ignorance all congeal the elixir.

True dragon, true tiger,
realms extinguished, mind forgotten—knowing its place.
Lead and mercury transmit,
their union must transcend all boundaries.

Again—

Carefree and at ease,
coming and going without hindrance.
A single expanse of numinous emptiness,
everywhere round and bright, nothing obstructed.

No division of inner and outer,
luminous through the sands, embracing the Dharma-realm.
Universally illuminating, selfless—
like the bright moon in autumn’s high vault.

Again—

Heart mad, intent playful,
hard to discern truth from falsehood within.
Intent playful, heart mad—
summoning all life’s sins and transgressions.

Heart calmed, intent stilled,
within stillness, wisdom’s power shines clearly.
Intent stilled, heart calmed—
the Dao naturally returns, spirit naturally numinous.

Again—

Meeting yet not awakening,
alas, the keen-witted chase desire away.
Now, time slips by—
how can I bear this?

If one day you arrive,
regret comes late—embrace the profound Dao.
Return early to cultivation,
avoid wandering the three paths and six destinies.

Again—

A skin-bag of water and clouds,
like water, like clouds—ever at ease.
At ease, a leisurely person,
in leisure, seeking the body beyond things.

Act or dwell as you will,
beyond form, true emptiness is cultivated in leisure.
To find true emptiness—
only in the deepest stillness of South Mountain.

Again—

Where the dust-heart arises,
the path of carefree clouds and water is blocked.
When the dust-heart does not rise,
form and appearance return to emptiness—monkey and horse subdued.

Now, seeing through—
preserve heaven’s truth, pass time in leisure.
To know heaven’s truth—
a body forged of white jade and yellow gold.

*To the Tune of "Spring in Wuling"*
*For Daoist Li, Breaking the Character*

The sun urges you, yet you do not heed,
beneath it, ever more frantic in greed.
Within, often turning, you wound yourself—
how could you ever reflect thus?

Nurture the numinous root, firmly secure it,
turn your gaze inward, let it shine.
Idly drifting, all affairs forgotten—
within, the immortal’s incense burns hot.

*To the Tune of "Southern Village"*

Chasing nothing in all things,
the hare and man alike fret over honor and disgrace.
Worldly cunning and schemes—all set aside.
Rest, rest—
following others’ whims brings no freedom.

Best to imprison the self,
fall into disarray, wander clouds and waters as fate allows.
Begging to preserve the heart, dissolve old sins—
cultivate, cultivate—
like the inescapable end of life’s limit.

*To the Tune of "Eternal Joy"*

To Marshal Wang the Third of Junzhou

Wandering free and at ease,
treading the path with steadfast calm—
let clouds drift, let waters flow.
Fallen into careless indulgence,
hair unkempt, face unwashed,
day after day as if drunk.
Drifting, drifting, carefree and idle,
roaming without a tether,
coming or going, nothing to bind.
Seeking scraps to fill the belly,
wherever night falls, sleep comes unbound.

None have awakened—
all their cultivation,
self-imposed, hard to sever.
Desire knows no shore,
torment in the bitter sea—
when will birth and death end?
A straw cloak, a bamboo hat,
following fate as it comes,
such is the Daoist’s livelihood.
You and I, still lost in delusion,
unwilling to let go—
just remain as you are.

Twelve Poems to the Tune of "Treading the Grass"

A cloud-and-water idler,
indulgent in plain cloth.
Roaming beyond the world,
treading mist and rosy clouds.
With heart preserved, begging alms
from dawn to dusk,
door to door, bowing in assent.

Water still, clouds at rest,
not swayed by others’ drift.
Mist scatters, fire fades—
the joy of cool clarity.
This journey to the sacred realm
returns once more to emptiness.
Staff in hand, alone I climb
the road to Chang’an.

Against repeated warnings, the wise remain unwise—
words left behind, mere traces of advice.
Yet in those words, only this plea:
*Turn back, cultivate anew*—
never once did they heed the call.

Awaken early to the wheel’s turning,
seek swiftly the path of escape.
Day and night, the two wheels hasten—
this life’s glory and rank, a debt from past lives,
but where will the fruit of the next life lead?

---

Forsaking the worldly, cultivating the Way,
transcending dust to return to simplicity.
Serene and still, thoughts forgotten,
the mad monkey and restless horse locked in an empty room—
only the luminous source, a single point, held fast.

Seek not the golden elder,
search not for dragon and tiger.
In pure leisure, wander freely.
A wisdom-wind scatters the clouds atop the ridge,
one moon illuminates the path to Caoxi.

---

Step by step, no birth—
affinity draws near to Chan and the Dao.
Illuminating the hidden, harmonizing with *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*.
For ten years, the wind immortal sought the primordial,
now at last, the cloud-path beckons early.

Awakened to the true self,
boundless treasures within—
why craft the fruits of karmic leakage?
A life of ease, my family’s way,
carefree and open, my gate’s virtue.

---

Having attained the cultivation of truth,
one must delve into the mysteries of the profound.

All matters in the heart, forgotten and cast aside.
By the master’s wondrous guidance, the primordial origin is realized—
a single point of radiance rises atop the mountain.
A life of carefree wandering,
a livelihood of water and clouds.
Roaming freely, at ease within the red dust,
lords and nobles, do not marvel at this wind-borne man—
ordinary as this, merely so.

---

Foolish and simple,
wordless, speechless.
Ashamed of vain distinctions idly made.
From now on, no more running outward—
within, the subtlest wonder favors the clumsy.
Gather the spirit, roll up the scroll,
conceal brilliance, erase traces.
All vexations born of emptiness cease at once.
In Jetavana’s garden, plant jade blossoms—
a single fragrant golden lotus takes form.

---

No sooner do spring flowers appear
than autumn’s moon arrives.
Spring flowers, autumn moon—when will they end?
I urge you: awaken swiftly, do not waste time.
Within the gourd, another fine season awaits.
Sever love, transcend the dust—
be fierce and resolute.
Refine primordial yang, delve into the mysteries’ secrets.
Polish the spirit-pearl, let it not grow dim—
no coming, no going, beyond birth and death.

---

Endure humiliation, eat plain fare,
forever forsake impure wine.
Cleanse the heart, purify the mind, forget all existence.
Increase and decrease—emptiness is realized,
calm and steady, no other path.
Still and clear,
enduring as heaven and earth.
Hold fast to spring flowers and autumn moon.
Press onward, unshaken and upright,
silent and wordless, lips sealed.

A single mystery-pearl,
long shrouded in darkness.
Greed, wrath, and delusion stain it—hard to dissolve.
Sudden cultivation washes it clean, never to dim;
the wheel of rebirth and death poses no obstacle.
Hasten in practice, never slacken,
endure with unyielding patience.
When the heart is fully realized, where lies the return?
A crane leads through colored clouds to Penglai’s gathering.

*For Zhao Liushi of Xingping*

A hundred years of glory,
stars shift, light fades.
The human body scarce endures from dawn to dusk.
Kindness and love now gathered empty,
the final hour soon parts all.
Awaken early to rebirth’s terror,
startled by life’s sorrow.
Sever love, forsake attachment, grasp the mystery’s secrets.
Be fierce and resolute, enter the pure void—
the wind-borne poet grants you the moon of an open heart.

*For Lord Xu of Jingzhao*

The heart’s sacred field,
never swept or tended.
Dust and grime long darken it, wild grasses grow.
The spirit-spring scatters, fails to congeal—
how then to forge the treasure of long life?
Clouds and waters seek truth,
carefree, they wander in search of the Dao.
To leave home is to leave sorrow behind.
If wisdom awakens and the heart rests,
you’ll drink aged pántáo on a solitary peak.

*For Marshal Wang the Third*

I bow to you, Lord Wang,
brief words I offer.
Frost touches your temples now in twilight years.
When will clinging to love and kindness cease?
A healthy, idle body—best to still the heart.
Profound truths lie hidden,
worldly cares are upside-down.
In solitude and ease, delve into the mystery’s depths.
Walk with water and clouds to seek Danyang,
drink aged pántáo on a solitary peak.

*For Wang Silang of Xunzhou*

Brother in virtue arrives, speaking of your depths—
I hear and suddenly sigh in admiration.
One mother’s three branches betray long-held bonds,
how could the heart bear such change?
Regret past wrongs, amend conduct with skillful means.
Wisdom awakens, understanding dawns—
come swiftly to meet face-to-face.
With you, elder brother, I’ll feast in joyful countenance.
Should even slight discord arise, the Wind Master will resolve it,
surely smoothing all entanglements.
Water and clouds depart—no more parting meetings.

*To the tune "Sand of the Washing Stream"*
*Farewell to Lord Jia*

Clouds and waters drift beyond the mundane,
fishing alone with a line from the great divine boat.
Lost in the bitter sea of delusion, yet never swallowing the hook.

Returning to the jade-green waves, homeward bound,
reuniting with Ma, Qiu, Liu in the homeland’s mountains.
A jade flask of golden elixir feasts the immortal companions.

*Sent to Lord Lu*

The Master of Long Life composed "Courtyard Full of Fragrance,"
in praise of Dao and Chan, sent to aid the karmic affinity of Lord Lu Wude.

The Chan lineage of Śākyamuni,
the Daoist Patriarch Lord Lao,
Lü, Zhong, Hai, and Chan illumine heaven.
Chongyang established the teaching,
spreading good affinity by the Eastern Sea.
Only to deliver Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma,
branching into separate streams—Wang and Hao first transmitted.
Henceforth they depart,
gathering on the Ten Isles in immortal assembly,
where cloud companions unite in nature’s harmony.

Attaining immortality—
neither difficult nor easy.
Eight hundred deeds of cultivation,
three thousand merits fulfilled.
Awaiting the purple decree from celestial script,
when nature and life are whole.
To emerge from the shell of yin and yang,
ever unstained, all things without flaw.
Truly enlightened,
tortoise and serpent entwined,
yin exhausted, one ascends to the primordial origin.

*End of the Lower Scroll of the Water and Cloud Collection*

*Postscript:*
#1 This tune pattern should be "Treading the Sand in Shifted Mode."
#2 This lyric was composed by Liu Chuxuan, not by Master Tan.

Amid heaven and earth, humans stand—
round of head, square of foot,
bearing consciousness, containing emotion,
endowed with the essence of the Five Phases,
crowned as the spirit of all things.
Buddha-nature and immortal potential lie within,
alchemical furnace and elixir hearth all prepared.

Should one cast aside cravings,
forsake frivolity,
sever greed,
renounce fame and profit,
and still the breath in tranquil emptiness,
then may one attain longevity and enduring vision.

The immortal Master Tan of Changzhen,
by virtue of karmic affinity,
in his prime encountered the Patriarch Chongyang.
With Danyang, Changsheng, and Changchun, he shared the same master.
Later, following the Perfected One,
he journeyed west to Bianliang,
where the oral transmission was bestowed.
Thereafter, in Luochuan,
he accumulated merit and cultivated conduct,
first transcending the world to ascend in truth.

His surviving recorded words and verses,
though but a few hundred,
all enfold wondrous efficacy,
probing the workings of creation.
Entitled *Water and Cloud Collection*,
they have long circulated throughout the land.
Yet in the bingwu year,
a great flood in Jun Prefecture
washed away the printing blocks.

Upon hearing this,
the immortal and long-lived Master Liu
was deeply grieved.
He promptly ordered craftsmen
to re-engrave them at the Quanzhen Hall in Donglai.
Now, after years of warfare,
none in the realm remain intact.

Lu Qian, styled Gaoyou, and his wife Meng Changshan,
their entire household diligently devoted to the Dao,
traveled between Huai and Chu,
seeking the Perfected One’s lost manuscripts.
At last, from a disciple’s keeping—
as if by divine bestowal—
they recovered the complete volume.
Fearing this text might vanish forever,
they once more commissioned its carving and printing
at the Western Hermitage in Shanyang City.
Truly, one sees how deeply Master Gao cherishes the teachings.

Alas! The Perfected One ascended long ago,
and such writings can never be recovered.
Having seen the preface composed by my late father,
I was further entrusted to append this postscript.
Thus, despite my crude and barren words,
I offer this account.

One day, as I was compiling and arranging the *Pearl and Jade Collection*—a gathering of immortal-descended verses and hymns—suddenly, banners tall as forests and standards grand as clouds stood arrayed before my humble gate. Startled, I rose to greet the visitors at my door, only to find it was Master Xiao, come once more to cast his gaze upon me. We bowed and entered together, whereupon he addressed me, saying:

“Recently, a fellow Daoist, Zhang Zhiquan, journeyed thousands of *li* without regard for distance to bring me *The Water and Cloud Collection*, a work compiled by Master Tan, the Long-Realized One, during his lifetime. Though I am unlearned in letters and unworthy of my place in the teaching, I hold it in deep reverence. Yet after repeated wars and fires, nearly all the printing blocks of the profound and wondrous writings of the Complete Perfection tradition have been burned to ashes. Only this collection survives, fortunately preserved within a wall by some devoted soul. If we do not carve new blocks and disseminate it widely, I fear it may vanish entirely, leaving future seekers of the Dao with nothing to study or seek. I beg you to compose a preface for its reprinting.”

I replied, “In the past, the father and son scholars of Dongmou, Fan the Rectifier of Learning—men of towering talent, ardent devotion, and vast learning—have already written a preface for it. How dare I presume to add anything?” Though I repeatedly declined, I could not escape his earnest request. Thus, I offer these scattered words merely to fulfill his noble command.

On the Double-Yang Festival of the *jichou* year.
