**Śākyamuni Buddha:**
The Dharma is fundamentally without Dharma,
Yet the Dharma-less Dharma is also Dharma.
Now, when the Dharma-less is transmitted,
How can Dharma meet with Dharma?

**Mahākāśyapa the Venerable:**
Dharmas are originally twofold Dharma,
Yet without Dharma, there is no non-Dharma.
Why, within a single Dharma,
Do some see Dharma and others not?

**Śāṇavāsa the Venerable:**
It is neither Dharma nor mind,
Without mind, there is no Dharma.
When speaking of mind-Dharma,
This Dharma is not mind-Dharma.

**Upagupta the Venerable:**
The mind is originally the mind,
The original mind is not a Dharma.
If there is Dharma, there is the original mind,
Yet it is neither mind nor original Dharma.

**Dhṛṭaka the Venerable:**
When you recognize the nature of mind,
It may be called the inconceivable.
Yet when fully realized, nothing is attained—
When attained, it cannot be spoken or known.

**Great Master Bodhidharma:**
In the womb, it is the body;
In the world, it is the person.
In the eye, it is seeing;
In the ear, it is hearing;
In the nose, it discerns fragrance;
In the mouth, it engages in discourse;
In the hands, it grasps and holds;
In the feet, it moves and runs.
Pervading and encompassing the Dharma-realm,
It is gathered into a single mote of dust.
Those who recognize it know it as Buddha-nature;
Those who do not call it the spirit-soul.

It does not see evil and generate aversion,
Nor observe goodness and strive for it.
It does not abandon wisdom to approach foolishness,
Nor cast off delusion to attain awakening.
It transcends measure in penetrating the Great Dao,
And surpasses bounds in comprehending the Buddha-mind.
Not entangled with ordinary or sacred,
It is called "uncovered" in its transcendent state.

When deluded, people pursue Dharma;
When awakened, Dharma follows people.
Awakened, one recognizes that perception encompasses form;
Deluded, form encompasses perception.
Merely by the mind’s discrimination,
Calculations arise from the mind itself.
All measurements are but dreams—
If you recognize the mind’s original quiescence,
Without a single stirring thought,
This is called true awakening.

**Great Master Sengcan:**
Though flowers are sown in the earth,
From the earth, the flower-seed grows.
If no one plants the seed,
Neither flower nor earth arises.

The supreme Dao is not difficult,
Only avoid picking and choosing.
Simply do not love or hate,
And all becomes perfectly clear.
Round and equal to the great void,
Nothing lacking, nothing in excess.
Truly, it is through grasping and rejecting
That one falls short.
Do not chase after existence,
Nor cling to the endurance of emptiness.
Maintain a single, even mind,
And all distinctions naturally dissolve.

To halt movement is to return to movement,
Yet halting only increases movement.
Clinging to either side,
How can one know the singular?
If the singular is not penetrated,
Both sides lose their efficacy.
Abandoning existence and non-existence,
One turns from emptiness to oppose emptiness.
Returning to the root, one grasps the essence,
But following illumination, one loses the source.
A moment of turning inward
Surpasses all prior emptiness.
The transformation of prior emptiness
Arises from deluded perception.
Do not seek the real—
Only cease to hold views.

From duality arises oneness,
Yet even oneness must not be grasped.
When the mind does not arise,
The myriad dharmas are without fault.
Without fault, there is no Dharma;
Without arising, there is no mind.
When the subject vanishes, the object sinks;
The object follows the subject’s submersion.
The object arises from the subject,
The subject from the object.
To know these two aspects
Is to see they are originally one emptiness.
One emptiness unites the two,
Equally containing all phenomena.

The wise are without action,
The foolish bind themselves.
Dharma is not a different Dharma—
Delusion arises from clinging.
To employ the mind to use the mind,
Is this not a great error?

Delusion gives rise to quiet and disturbance;
Awakening is without good or evil.
All dualities
Must be carefully weighed.
Dreams, illusions, and empty flowers—
Why labor to grasp them?
Gain and loss, right and wrong—
Let them all be released at once.

If the eye does not sleep,
All dreams vanish of themselves.
If the mind does not differ,
The myriad dharmas are one thusness.

To halt movement is not movement,
To halt stillness is not stillness.
If the two cannot be established,
How can the one exist?
The one is all,
All is the one.
If you can be thus,
Why worry about incompletion?

All is the precepts of the self-nature,
All is the wisdom of unimpeded self-nature.
Neither increasing nor diminishing, it is the vajra of self-nature;
Departing and arriving, it is the samādhi of the original body.
Not seeing a single Dharma yet abiding in non-seeing
Is like floating clouds obscuring the face of the sun.
Not knowing a single Dharma yet clinging to empty knowing
Is like lightning flashing in the great void.
When such knowing and seeing fleetingly arise,
How can one mistakenly recognize them as expedient means?
You should, in a single thought, know your own error—
Your own numinous light is ever manifest.

**Great Master Hongren:**
Sentient beings sow the seed,
And from the ground, the fruit arises.
The insentient have no seed,
Thus, without nature, there is no arising.

**Great Master Lu Neng:**
Fundamentally, bodhi has no tree,
Nor is the bright mirror a stand.
Originally, there is not a single thing—
Where could dust alight?

When the mind is deluded, the *Lotus Sutra* turns;
When the mind awakens, it turns the *Lotus Sutra*.
Reciting the sutra for long without understanding
Makes it an enemy of its meaning.

Without thought, thought is correct;
With thought, thought becomes deviant.
Neither calculating existence nor non-existence,
One eternally rides the white ox cart.

Samādhi is the essence of wisdom,
Wisdom is the function of samādhi.
At the time of wisdom, samādhi is in wisdom;
At the time of samādhi, wisdom is in samādhi.
Like the light of a lamp—
With the lamp, there is light;
Without the lamp, there is darkness.
The lamp is the essence of light,
Light is the function of the lamp.
Though the names are two,
Their essence is not different.

To seek to see the Buddha,
Only recognize sentient beings.
It is only because sentient beings are deluded about the Buddha,
Not because the Buddha is deluded about sentient beings.
If the self-nature awakens,
Sentient beings are the Buddha;
If the self-nature is deluded,
The Buddha is sentient beings.
When the self-nature is equanimous,
Sentient beings are the Buddha;
When the self-nature is biased,
The Buddha is sentient beings.

The Buddha is in my own mind—
My own Buddha is the true Buddha.
If I myself lack the Buddha-mind,
Where can the true Buddha be sought?
Thus, the sutra says:
When the mind arises, the myriad dharmas arise;
When the mind ceases, the myriad dharmas cease.

The ordinary person is the Buddha,
Afflictions are bodhi.
The prior thought deluded is the ordinary person;
The subsequent thought awakened is the Buddha.
The prior thought attached to conditions is affliction;
The subsequent thought detached from conditions is bodhi.

**Chan Master Farong:**
Conditions have no beauty or ugliness—
Beauty and ugliness arise from the mind.
If the mind does not impose names,
Where can deluded thoughts arise?
When deluded thoughts do not arise,
The true mind functions freely.

**Chan Master Huizhong**

The thought-stream is but illusion from the start,
True nature has no end nor beginning.
If one grasps this meaning,
The long waves will cease of themselves.

Person and dharma both pure,
Good and evil both forgotten.
The straight mind, the true intent—
This is the bodhimanda.

**Chan Master Shenxiu:**
All Buddha-dharmas are originally within the mind;
To seek them outside is to abandon the father and flee.

**Great Master Sida of Nanyue:**
The source of the Dao is not far,
The sea of nature is not distant.
Seek only within yourself,
Do not search elsewhere.
To search is not to find,
And what is found is not real.

**Master Wugong of Tianhuang:**
Follow your nature, roam freely,
Wander at ease with conditions.
Simply exhaust the ordinary mind—
There is no separate "sacred" understanding.

**Chan Master Benjing:**
The Buddha is awakened through the mind,
The mind is revealed through the Buddha.
If one awakens to no-mind,
The Buddha too does not exist.
The Dao is fundamentally without mind,
"No-mind" is the name of the Dao.
If one fully understands no-mind,
No-mind *is* the Dao.

Seeing, hearing, knowing, perceiving—no obstruction,
Sound, scent, taste, touch—ever in samadhi.
Like a bird flying in empty space,
No grasping, no rejecting, no love, no hate.
If one meets conditions with no-mind,
Only then is one called "Guan Zizai."

To see the Dao is to cultivate the Dao;
Without seeing it, what is there to cultivate?
The nature of the Dao is like empty space—
What does empty space contain?
Survey those who cultivate the Dao:
They stir the fire seeking floating bubbles.

Just watch the fine marionettes—
When the coins run out, all comes to rest.

Push the real: the real has no form.
Exhaust the false: the false has no shape.
Turn back to examine and push the mind—
Know that the mind too is but a provisional name.

Good arises from the mind—
Can evil exist apart from the mind?
Good and evil are external conditions,
In the mind they truly do not exist.
Where to discard evil?
Whom to entrust with good?
Alas for those of two minds,
Running back and forth between conditions.
If one awakens to the original no-mind,
Only then will one regret past faults.

**Chan Master Zhongguo of Nanyang:**
Green vines climb straight to the cold pine’s peak;
White clouds drift through mud, emerging in the vast emptiness.

All dharmas are fundamentally at rest,
Yet people themselves create disturbance.
When beings are deluded, they congeal nature into mind—
Like water freezing into ice in the cold.
When beings awaken, they dissolve mind back into nature—
Like ice melting into water in warmth.

Dharma, dharma, dharma—originally no dharma;
Empty, empty, empty—yet not empty.
Stillness and clamor, speech and silence—all originally the same.
Why labor to speak of dreams within a dream?

In the useful there is no use;
In effortless effort, effort is applied—
Like fruit ripening naturally red,
Ask not how to cultivate or plant.

**Master Jigong of Panshan:**
The mind-moon stands alone, perfectly round,
Its light embracing the ten thousand images.
The light does not illuminate objects,
Nor do objects exist.
When both light and objects are forgotten,
What remains?

**Master Haigong of Dazhu:**
If one does not follow sounds and forms to stir thoughts,
Does not chase after appearances,
The mind’s understanding arises naturally—
Able to go without affairs.

The *Prajñā Sūtra* says:
The nine kinds of beings,
Each body fully equipped,
Transform as they create—
Thus arises ignorance.

As egg-born: wrapped in affliction;
As womb-born: steeped in the waters of love;
As moisture-born: vexation arises from longing;
As transformation-born: awakening is Buddhahood.

Delusion is called "sentient beings,"
Bodhisattvas take thought after thought—
The mind *is* sentient beings.
If one fully understands each thought,
Both mind and substance are empty—
This is called "delivering sentient beings."

The wise, at their own original ground,
Deliver what has not yet taken form.
Since the unformed is empty,
They know in truth no sentient being is liberated.

**Master Shanlu of the Good Perch:**
There is something prior to heaven and earth,
Formless, originally still and silent.
It can be the master of the ten thousand images,
Yet does not fade with the four seasons.

Empty-handed, grasping a hoe,
Walking on foot, riding an ox.
People pass over the bridge—
The bridge flows, the water does not.

Night after night, embracing the Buddha in sleep,
Morning after morning, rising together.
Rising and sitting, always accompanied,
Speech and silence, dwelling as one.
Not the slightest separation—
Like form and shadow, inseparable.
If you wish to know where the Buddha is,
Just this very voice is it.

**Master Huizhen of Jianzhen:**
The eye’s light fades with colors,
The ear’s perception vanishes with sounds.
To return to the source—no other meaning,
Yesterday and today the same.

**Master Mi of Jiashan:**
The mind is originally Buddha—
When thoughts arise, one drifts and sinks.
The shore does not move,
Yet the boat races swiftly.

**Master Bei of Xuansha:**
The mirror reflects all images,
Its radiance undisturbed;
The bird flies in empty space,
Its color not mingling with the sky.

**Master Fu the Layman:**
Salt’s flavor in water,
Glue’s blue within color—
Ultimately they exist,
Yet their form is unseen.

False calculation leads to attachment,
Mistaking rope for snake;
Doubtful mind conjures dark ghosts,
Ailing eyes see flowers in the void.

One realm is not different,
Yet three people see it differently.
Understanding this as unreal,
One forever rides the white ox cart.

**Master Bai of Fayun:**
Li Zhu with intent—
White waves surge in vain;
Xiang Wang without mind—
The bright pearl suddenly in hand.

**Master Shou of Yongming:**
Like the wish-fulfilling jewel that follows colors,
All forms appear yet the original body remains unmoved;
Like the echoing valley responding to sounds,
All voices arise yet their source leaves no trace.

A lone gibbon cries, the moon falls on the central crag;
A rustic traveler chants, the lamp burns low at midnight.
Who can comprehend this scene at this moment?
A meditating monk in the depths of white clouds.

The true mind’s essence
Cannot be expressed in words.
Limpid as boundless empty space,
Luminous as a flawless mirror.

Praise and blame do not reach it,
Principle and reason cannot fathom it.
It cannot be exhausted by existence or nonexistence,
Nor can its wondrous body be discoursed upon by knowledge or wisdom.
Only those who enter it know it in their hearts.

Like grinding ten thousand ingredients into incense—
One speck of dust already contains all fragrances;
Like bathing in the great sea—
A single handful of water already uses all rivers.

When seeing nature, nature is originally free—
Thoughts are not thoughts to be removed.
When observing things, things are originally nonexistent—
Forms are not things to be dispelled.

Eyes full of sights, ears full of sounds,
Neither following nor destroying—
Only then does one understand the true nature of sights and sounds.
If one falls into the gate of sounds and forms,
One falls into the realm of ordinary beings;
If one destroys the appearances of sounds and forms,
One enters the lesser vehicle.

Thus the Tathāgata’s true eye
Illuminates all without omission—
How could it be like the blind eyes of ordinary beings,
Or the dim vision of the two vehicles?
Then, meeting conditions without hindrance,
Touching realms without arising.

Pángyùn Layman:
Simply wish to empty all that exists—
Beware of reifying what does not.

Shuǐmíng Shòu-gōng:
The true source is profound and still,
The ocean of awakening, limpid and clear.
Cutting off the roots of names and forms,
No nearness of subject or object remains.

At first, unaware,
A sudden stirring of the mind arises;
By clarity, illumination begins,
Following illumination, dust is established.
As reflections appear in a mirror,
The root-body suddenly arises—
From this, the true is lost, the nature forgotten,
Clinging to forms, chasing after names.
Accumulating the dust of stagnant passions,
Weaving the waves of continuous consciousness.

Locking true awakening in the night of dreams,
Sinking into delusion within the three realms;
Blinding the eye of wisdom on dark roads,
Crawling within the nine dwellings.
Toward the unchanging realm of emptiness,
Receiving rebirth in the inescapable dharma—
Self-generated bondage, like spring silkworms spinning cocoons,
Or autumn moths rushing toward flame,
With the threads of dualistic delusion,
Binding the karmic mass of suffering;
With the wings of ignorance and craving,
Dashing into the fire-wheel of birth and death.

There are also those of heterodox roots and external seeds,
With shallow wisdom and provisional devices,
Who do not understand the source of the illness of birth and death,
Nor know the origin of the view of self and others.
They merely seek to shun noise and reject movement,
To break forms and analyze dust,
Though they claim to savor stillness and darkness,
They do not know they bury the true and resist awakening—
Like failing to distinguish red and green in the eye,
But only extinguishing the layered light upon the lamp,
Ignoring the illusory body within perception,
Yet vainly avoiding the empty shadow in sunlight.

Such is the labor of form and toil of thought,
A waste of effort, a loss of merit—
No different from adding water to ice,
Or casting firewood into flame.
Who knows that layered light resides in the blue,
And empty shadows follow the body?
Remove the diseased eye, and layered light vanishes of itself;
Cease the illusory form, and empty shadows must fade.

If one can turn the light inward,
Reflect upon the mind within the realm,
The Buddha-eye shines and karmic shadows dissolve,
The Dharma-body appears and the dust’s edge is cut off.
With the blade of self-awakened wisdom,
Split open the heart-pearl enmeshed within entanglements;
Wield the single thought of insight
To forge anew the net of views from former dust.

This is truly the essence of exhausting the mind,
The explanation of penetrating knowledge.

Cíyún Cōng Chánshī:
A sliver of moon soaks the cold pond,
Wisps of cloud mirror the azure sky.
For those who have attained the Dao,
What fine news this is.

Huángshān Lún-gōng:
One dives into the Red Waters to seek the pearl,
Enters Mount Jingshan to find the jade.
Yet what enters through the gate is not the family treasure—
Mistaking the shadow for the head, is this not a grave error?

Tiānyī Huái-gōng:
Wild geese cross the vast sky,
Their shadows sink into the cold water.
The geese have no intent to leave traces,
The water has no mind to retain reflections.

Guīfēng Chánshī:
When used, waves surge and the sea boils—
The whole true body moves in action;
When at rest, the mirror is bright, the water still—
All conditions gather in stillness.

The mind has no inherent form,
It arises only when relying on conditions;
The realm of dust is empty, appearing only because of the mind.

Zhìzhēn Chánshī:
The mind is originally free of dust—what need is there to wash it?
The body is without illness—why seek medicine?
To know whether this is the Buddha or not,
Observe the bright mirror, high and suspended, before it shines.

Lǐ Cháng-gōng:
Ten ages, past and present,
Beginning and end never leave the edge of the present thought;
Realms of self and other are not separated by a hair’s breadth.

The wise and the ordinary do not obstruct each other,
Like many mirrors reflecting all forms;
The self and the other pose no hindrance,
Like a thousand lamps sharing one room.

Tiāntái Guān-gōng:
Transcending names and appearances, the wondrous essence fully manifests;
Beyond past and present, the direct mechanism stands alone.
Grasping the black pearl to illuminate things, each thing radiates brilliance;
Brandishing the sacred sword to cleave the void, all traces vanish from the void.

Yúnmén Kǎn-gōng:
Before worldly toils are shattered, encountering conditions gives rise to endless distinctions;
When the mind-mirror is perfectly bright, not even a hair’s breadth remains.
The numinous light shines purely,
Alone revealing the true constant.
Past and present both forgotten, sage and ordinary both transcended—
Only here can one roll and unfold at will,
Respond and act without deficiency,
Moving freely between the human realm and the heavens.

Dàjìng Chánshī:
Sitting idly at night, the mind’s thoughts scatter and fly.
Yet take this scattering, flying mind
To investigate the source of its flight—
When the investigation finds no source,
Where then do the scattering thoughts abide?
Turning back to investigate the investigating mind,
Where does the mind that investigates reside?
The wisdom that illuminates is fundamentally empty,
The realm it perceives is also still.
Stillness that is not stillness—
For there is no one who can still it;
Illumination that is no illumination—
For there is no realm to be illuminated.
When both realm and wisdom are still,
The mind’s anxieties naturally settle.
This is the essential path of returning to the source.

Seeing things, one sees the mind;
Without things, the mind does not appear.
Amidst full clarity or complete obstruction,
The true mind knows no bounds.
If the mind clings to knowledge and understanding,
It becomes inverted perception.
Only when seeing conditions without engaging the mind
Does one behold the firm ground of bodhi.

Yǒngjiā Chánshī:
When the mind accords with emptiness,
What care for slander or praise, what sorrow or joy?
When the body accords with emptiness,
What pain from the blade, what pleasure from fragrance?
When karmic retribution accords with emptiness,
What gain from giving, what loss from plunder?

The mind is not being, the mind is not non-being;
The mind is not non-being, the mind is not non-non-being.
To affirm being or non-being is to fall into affirmation;
To negate being or non-being is to fall into negation.
The idle Daoist, free from learning and effort,
Neither eliminates delusion nor seeks truth.
The true nature of ignorance is Buddha-nature,
The illusory, empty body is the Dharma-body.
When the Dharma-body awakens, nothing remains—
The original nature is the celestial true Buddha.
The five aggregates are floating clouds, coming and going in emptiness;
The three poisons are mere bubbles, rising and vanishing in illusion.

Stillness gives rise to mindlessness,
Awareness gives rise to scattered thoughts.
Stillness may cure scattered thoughts,
Yet it breeds mindlessness;
Awareness may cure mindlessness,
Yet it breeds scattered thoughts.
Thus it is said:
Awareness within stillness is true,
Mindlessness within stillness is not;
Stillness within awareness is true,
Scattered thoughts within awareness are not.

Ordinary people are often obstructed by affairs in principle,
By conditions in the mind.
They constantly seek to escape conditions to pacify the mind,
To abandon affairs to preserve principle—
Not knowing it is the mind that obstructs conditions,
Principle that obstructs affairs.
Simply allow the mind to be empty, and conditions will empty themselves;
Let principle be still, and affairs will still themselves.
Do not invert the proper use of the mind.

This Dharma is the mind itself—
Beyond the mind, no Dharma exists;
This mind is the Dharma itself—
Beyond the Dharma, no mind exists.
The mind is naturally without mind,
Nor is there one who lacks mind.
If one attempts to use the mind to lack mind,
The mind paradoxically becomes something.

Because of greed, anger, and delusion,
The precepts, concentration, and wisdom are established.
If there were no afflictions originally,
Why would bodhi be needed?
Thus the ancestral master said:
The Buddha taught all Dharmas
To eliminate all minds.
If I have no mind at all,
What use are all Dharmas?

Dòuchí Chánshī:
Awakening to the mind is easy, stilling the mind is hard.
When the mind’s source is stilled, leisure pervades everywhere.
As the Dipper turns and stars shift, the sky brightens toward dawn—
White clouds still cover the green mountains as before.

Língyù Shānzhǔ:
I possess a luminous pearl,
Long locked away by worldly toils.
Today, the dust is gone, and light arises,
Illuminating mountains and rivers for ten thousand leagues.

Fórì Cái-gōng:
The city is bustling and noisy,
The mountains and forests are quiet and still.
Though movement and stillness differ,
They are one—no different from life and death.
The four seasons turn in succession,
The principles of things are natural.
Summer does not depart, yet autumn arrives on its own;
The wind does not chill, yet people feel refreshed.

Guǎnghuì Chánshī:
The Buddha awakened through non-mind,
The mind is deluded by the existence of the Buddha.
Where the Buddha-mind is pure and clear,
Beyond the clouds, a wild ape cries.

Yuánwù Chánshī:
A bird flies through the empty sky—
Does the sky retain the bird’s shadow after it passes?
A fish swims in the floating water—
Does the water leave the fish’s trace after it departs?
The sage’s mind responding to things
Is likewise.

Shànshèng Chánshī

The echo ceases when the sound ends,
Yet one does not know sound is the root of echo;
The shadow flees when the form departs,
Yet one does not know form is the origin of shadow.
To inquire of the Dao with the Dao,
One does not know the Dao is originally without Dao;
To transmit the mind with the mind,
One does not know the mind is originally without mind.

Lóngjì Chánshī:
The wind stirs, the mind sways the tree,
Clouds arise, the nature stirs dust.
If one understands today’s affairs,
The original person remains obscured.

Green bamboo and yellow flowers are not external realms,
White clouds and bright moon reveal the whole body.
Everywhere is my family’s possession—
Picked up at will, yet not of dust.

Wúzhuó Chánshī:
A single leaf skiff drifts into vastness,
Oars dance and part from melody.
Clouds, mountains, water, moon—all cast aside,
Gaining only Zhuang Zhou’s long dream.

Clouds drift, the moon moves,
The boat sails, the shore shifts.
Not knowing the clouds of delusion
Are not the true moon;
Why does the boat of clinging attachment
Ever float on the unmoving shore of awakening?

Yúnyán Chánshī:
A single mote in the eye,
A thousand flowers scatter the sky;
A single delusion in the mind,
Countless sands arise and cease.
When the mote’s shade vanishes, delusion ends, truth remains.
Illness cured, medicine discarded—
Ice melts, water remains.

Echoes in the valley, praise and blame dissolve together;
Colors immersed in the moonlit pool, self and other fade away.
In desire, yet without desire;
Dwelling in dust, yet unstained by dust.
Passing through a thicket of a hundred flowers,
Not a single robe is soiled.

Jǐngcén Huīshī:
Obstruction is not the wall,
Passage is not empty space.
If one understands thus,
Mind and form are originally the same.

Huìtáng Chánshī:
The foolish remove circumstances but not the mind,
The wise remove the mind but not circumstances.
Not knowing circumstances are inherently thus,
Wherever the eye meets, one remains steadfast.

Nántái Héshàng:
At Nantai, sitting in stillness with a censer of incense,
All day long, serene, ten thousand cares forgotten.
Not by stilling the mind or removing delusions,
But because there is nothing to ponder.

Zōng- Chánshī:
Fine jade hidden in rough stone,
Lotus flowers emerging from mud.
Know that within affliction,
Awakening is bodhi.

Some speak of emptiness only to break attachment to existence,
Yet existence is also used to remove emptiness.
Again, existence is used to end existence,
Emptiness to dissolve emptiness—
Even when words and speech are cut off,
Thought and path exhausted,
It cannot be called emptiness,
How then could it be named existence?

Zhòngxuān Chánshī:
The ordinary and sacred are originally not two,
Delusion and awakening—how could their paths differ?
Not that nirvana is to be rejoiced in,
Nor that birth and death are to be loathed.
With a single word of awakening,
Without rising or sitting, one realizes the unborn;
With a single thought turning the light inward,
Without taking a step, one pervades the sands of the world.
Responding to stimuli, one communicates—
Like moonlight reflected in water;
In stillness, one answers—
Like an echo following sound in an empty valley.

To speak of Buddha-nature is emptiness,
To speak of Buddha-mind is reality.
With this real mind, Buddha-nature is not mere emptiness;
With this empty nature, Buddha-mind is not attached to form.

Shàowù Huīshī:
Peak after peak, mountain beyond mountain,
Sitting atop the solitary summit, observe closely.
Clouds roll back, mist disperses, mountains grow still—
The vast Chu sky, a single gust of cold.

Zhìjiān Huīshī:
The radiance of the autumn moon
Is seen only when the clamor ceases;
The sound of the cold spring
Is heard only in deep meditation.
Thus, movement of thought loses awareness,
Cessation of thought merges with truth.
Planting the fruit of merit in the ear’s root,
Opening the flower of awakening in the mind’s ground.

Though conditioned things are false,
Pursuing them makes the Buddha-way hard to achieve;
Though the unconditioned is true,
Clinging to it dims wisdom’s nature.

Gūfēng Zhǎnglǎo:
In daily use, nothing is not the Dao,
Peace of mind is Chan.
Dwelling in secluded clouds and valleys,
Dreaming amidst snow and reeds.

Wéikuān Huīshī:
The true cultivator neither strives nor forgets;
Striving approaches attachment,
Forgetting falls into ignorance.
A thousand waves rise and break—
The nature of water remains;
A thousand lamps light and extinguish—
The nature of fire is originally present.

The mind that forgets emotions does not abide in form,
Like hot water melting ice—
Water and ice both vanish, nothing to distinguish;
The mind that encounters circumstances cannot remain unmoved,
Like a valley responding to sound—
It answers and ceases, leaving no residue.

Zōng- Huīshī:
The moon’s reflection in the autumn pool,
The bell’s toll in the quiet night—
Unchanged despite repeated strikes,
Undispersed though touched by waves.

Kāixiānzhào Chánshī:
People’s minds do not cease,
Thoughts do not abide.
If one can cease where there is no ceasing,
And have no thought where there is thought,
One naturally accords with the principle of the unborn.

Scattering one into ten thousand,
The moon sinks into ten thousand rivers—ten thousand reflections;
Gathering ten thousand into one,
Water returns to a single vessel—only one moon.
Expanding, it fills the Dharma-realm;
Contracting, not even a hair’s tip remains.

Yùquán Yuǎn Chánshī:
One seal imprints emptiness—
Ten thousand images gathered in the ancient mirror;
One seal imprints water—
The autumn toad’s shadow falls into a thousand rivers;
One seal imprints clay—
Observe closely the patterns before they arise.

Bǎoníng Chánshī:
The three realms are only mind,
The ten thousand dharmas are only consciousness.
Clouds arise beyond the railing,
Raindrops fall before the eaves.
The stream’s water deep as indigo,
Mountain flowers blooming like brocade.
If one does not investigate the root at this moment,
One will have to wait to ask Maitreya.

Fójiàn Chánshī:
The supreme Dao is not difficult,
Only avoid picking and choosing.

The peach blossoms red, the plum blossoms white—
Who can merge them into one hue?
The purple swallow chitters, the yellow oriole sings—
Who says their calls are but a single sound?

A bright mirror stands before the dais—
How could it distinguish stillness from motion?
A solitary cloud emerges from the peak—
Why cling to going or staying?

From delusion, truth is spoken,
Yet truth has no inherent form;
From truth, delusion arises,
But delusion’s essence is fundamentally empty.
Once delusion returns to emptiness,
Truth, too, does not stand.

**Chan Master Zhida:**
When the mind establishes a realm, it exists;
When the mind is void, no realm arises.
When realm is empty and mind is still,
The mind illumines the realm with cool clarity.
In the ice-mirror, one sees one’s own image;
In the lamp-moon, one sees one’s own shadow;
In the mountain valley, one hears one’s own voice.

**Chan Master Baiguizhao:**
Birds flying through the void
Forget the void is their homeland;
Fish swimming in the water
Forget the water is their very life.

All of you, stand firmly here,
Focus your spirit,
Turn your light inward in a single thought—
Suddenly, you will see yourself,
No different from the red sun in the sky!
Spontaneously revolving, selfless,
A bright pearl in the dish turns of itself.

**Master Lin:**
Its essence transcends mind and thought;
Its purport surpasses past, present, and future.
Free from the mind’s intentions,
The myriad forms show no distinction;
Beyond past, present, and future,
The ten directions are utterly seamless.
Unobstructed at the outset,
Thoroughly without reliance.
Awakening lies before signs arise;
Application rests where no effort is made.

**Master Zhaojue:**
Add a single thread—
Like dust in the eye;
Remove a single thread—
Like carving flesh from the body.
Rely on the Dharma, not on people;
Rely on meaning, not on words;
Rely on wisdom, not on knowledge;
Rely on the understood meaning of scriptures,
Not on the ununderstood.

When cold, approach the fire;
When hot, wave a fan;
When hungry, eat;
When tired, sleep.
Thus it is said:
The cypress before Master Zhaozhou’s hall,
The pines behind Xiangyan’s ridge—
Planted for no other purpose
Than to summon the pure breeze.

**Master Yunfeng Jun:**
Slender bamboo and towering pines drip emerald fragrance,
A gentle breeze and sparse moonlight pass through the chill.
Who dwells in the old temple to the west?
Each day, the bell’s toll sends off the setting sun.

Wind in the branches, moon on the islet—
Both convey the mind;
Mist-shrouded isles and cloud-wrapped forests—
All reveal the wondrous purport.

**Venerable Baoji:**
The deluded body faces the mirror and sees its reflection—
Reflection and deluded body are no different.
Yet wishing to remove the reflection and keep the body,
One does not know the body, too, is fundamentally empty.
Body and reflection are not distinct—
Neither one nor the other can be held or abandoned.
To cling to one and discard the other
Is to forever drift apart from true principle.
Loving the sacred and hating the mundane,
One sinks and floats in the sea of birth and death.
Afflictions arise from the mind—
Without mind, where would afflictions dwell?
No need to discriminate or grasp at forms—
Naturally, the Dao is attained in an instant.

**Chan Master Longya:**
In a dream, who knows the dream is false?
Only upon waking does one realize the dream was nothing.
While deluded, it is just like events in a dream;
After awakening, it is like rising from sleep.

To seek the ox, visit the frontier;
To learn the Dao, seek the mindless.
When the ox is near, the mind is near—
Without mind, the Dao is easily found.

**Chan Master Wenyì:**
A single lotus bud,
Two slender green cypresses—
Why ask about lofty standards
In a monk’s garden?

**Chan Master Tong’an:**
Before the withered tree crag, diverging paths abound;
Travelers who reach this point all falter.
The egret stands in snow—no shared color;
The bright moon and reed flowers—nothing alike.
When all is fully understood, nothing is understood;
Where mystery upon mystery unfolds, one must still ask why.
Diligently I sing the song of the profound—
Can the toad in the void grasp the moon’s light?

**Monk of Yun Ding Mountain:**
Sitting idly, profoundly still—no sage knows,
Even if one speaks, nothing compares to this.
The stone man claps a board in the clouds;
The water maiden plays a flute beneath the waves.
If you say you do not hear, you have not yet understood;
If you seek its echo, you will still doubt.
I teach you to sing and respond—you must respond,
But do not ask about the notes of bamboo or silk.

**Chan Master Danxia:**
Recognize the treasure within your robe,
And the drunkenness of ignorance will awaken of itself.
Though the hundred bones dissolve,
One thing remains eternally numinous.
Know that realms are not the true essence;
The spirit-pearl has no fixed form.
Awakened, one is a three-bodied Buddha;
Deluded, one doubts even ten thousand scriptures.
In the mind, the mind can be fathomed;
Through the ear, the ear cannot hear.
The formless preceded heaven and earth;
The dark spring emerges from the profound.
Originally firm, it needs no forging;
Originally pure, it requires no settling.
Spontaneously revolving like the sun at dawn,
Translucent like the morning star.
Auspicious light flows unceasingly;
True qi stirs and revives.
Reflecting, the hollow peaks are still;
Encompassing, the Dharma-realm is bright.
Understanding speech does not depend on the tongue;
Uttering words is not the same as sound.
At the farthest edge, vastness is stilled;
Without bounds, it equals the level void.
Seeing the moon is not about observing the finger;
Returning home requires no path.
Know the mind, and the mind is Buddha—
What other Buddha could there be to attain?

**Chan Master Tongzhi:**
The true self is originally present—
Deluded, it seems absent;
The false self is originally nonexistent—
Grasped, it appears to exist.
To understand the mind,
There is no mind to understand;
The mind that is not understood
Is called the true mind.
When truth and delusion interpenetrate,
The ordinary mind sees the Buddha-mind;
When principle and practice are cultivated together,
One relies on original wisdom to seek Buddha-wisdom.

**Master Chonghua Zan:**
Sealing emptiness, sealing clay, sealing water—
On level ground, cold waves fiercely rise.
Even if one strives with utmost effort,
In the end, it is but a turtle dragging its tail.

**Monk Dan Jiao’s Inscription on a Portrait:**
Depicting form to see oneself—
Seeing oneself, one harms the spirit.
Already a dream within a dream,
Further encountering a body beyond the body.
Water flowers congeal into illusory substance;
Ink hues gather as empty dust.
Alas, both you and I
Remain unenlightened beings.

**Master Zhu Anzhu:**
Dew glistens on green grass like jade;
The golden wind stirs the white duckweed.
A single cry of a cold goose passes—
Awakening one who has not yet awakened.

Like the sun emitting flames, sharing redness with motes of dust—
Yet it is not truly red;
Like water, clear and still, holding light clouds to share its greenness—
Yet it is not truly green.

**Master Shan Gu:**
The lifeblood of the monk’s lineage,
The mind-essence of the ancient Buddhas.

As the moon of contention shines forth, ten thousand waves divide its reflection;
As the hair-splitting sword is wielded, a thousand miles see no man.

Desire’s fire is quenched by precepts;
Fear’s fire is quenched by samādhi;
The fire of ignorance is quenched by wisdom.

The numinous spring flows ceaselessly, dissolving the heart’s vexation and restlessness;
The stream of wisdom trickles gently, irrigating the palace of purity and coolness.

A thousand rivers hold water—one moon of treasure mirrors the cold pool;
Ten thousand hearths hold no smoke—the golden wind blows across every face.

**Master Shan Tangfu:**
Burying a callus on a fingertip, plucking a single hair to move nine oxen.
Mount Hua stretches green to the heavens; the Yellow River flows clear to its depths.
Cut off the pointing finger, swiftly turn the gaze—
Beneath the green bamboo hat, endless affairs;
Within the green straw cloak, all at once still.

**Master Juehai Hui:**
The azure vault contends with no clouds; the autumn sky holds a bright moon.
The Long River gleams like silk; the clear wind comes without cease.
A Daoist in the forest’s shade, gazing in shared delight.
Though still within the gate of teaching and transformation—
What then is the Daoist’s own affair?
Leisurely on stone, watching flowing water,
Wishing to wash the Chan robe, yet finding no dust.

**Master Linji:**
A thought of doubt—earth comes to bind;
A thought of love—water comes to drown;
A thought of fear—fire comes to burn;
A thought of joy—wind comes to scatter.
If one can discern thus, not turned by circumstances,
One may use circumstances everywhere.
Yet once it touches the lips, it falls into meaning;
Even if thoroughly liberated, one remains in sinking and drowning.

All day eating rice, yet never biting a single grain;
All day wearing clothes, yet never hanging a single thread.
Only then can one transform the great earth into gold,
Churn the long river into ghee.

**Master Fa:**
The Dharmakāya is without form—it cannot be sought through sound;
The wondrous Dao is without words—it cannot be grasped through script.
Even if one surpasses buddhas and ancestors, one still falls on the steps;
Even if one speaks of the subtle and profound, one remains entangled in layers of teeth.
Only when merit leaves no trace, when shadows leave no residue,
When withered trees and cold cliffs hold no moisture,
When the illusory person and wooden horse are empty of conceptual thought—
Only then can one lower the hand to enter the marketplace,
Turn the body to take on other forms.
Yet one does not say: in the land of no outflows, one cannot stay,
And so returns to the cold sands beyond the misty cove.

**Master Conglun:**
Like a bright pearl in the palm—
When Hu comes, it appears as Hu; when Han comes, it appears as Han.
Taking a blade of grass as the sixteen-foot golden body,
Using a blade of grass as a blade of grass.

**Master Zhiming Hui’s Inscription on a Portrait:**
Twice washed, the pale red peach blossoms soften;
The wind sways the light green willow threads.
Within the shadow of white clouds, strange rocks emerge;
Amid the gleam of green waters, ancient trees stand clear.

Alas!

Who are you?
**Master Muzheng:**
Blossoms unfurl on jeweled branches,
Willows burst forth along the embankment.
The yellow warbler tunes Ji Shuye’s zither,
Fragrant grasses enter Xie Gong’s verses.

Why must one see form to clarify the mind,
Hear sound to awaken to the Dao?
Not only is this like seeking vomit upon the water—
It is already dust in the eye.

In delusion, one must rely on the Three Vehicles’ teachings;
After awakening, one knows there is not even a single word.
**Master Duochong:**
A concave mirror makes one appear gaunt,
A convex mirror makes one appear stout.
Better to shatter the mirror
And restore my original face.

**Master Duanji:**
Thought does not cease by forgetting dust,
Dust is not forgotten by ceasing thought.
Forget dust, yet ceasing ceases nothing;
Cease thought, yet forgetting forgets nothing.

Great delusion is not foolishness,
Emerging truth is not wisdom.
Life’s delusory name is real;
Confusion of truth is called delusion.
How could delusion transform into truth by following folly,
Or truth revert to delusion by pursuing wisdom?
Folly and wisdom differ of themselves!

Thus Master Guan observed:
Delusion arises from confusing truth;
Awakening to truth halts delusion.

When principle is clear, speech is cut off—
What words could discuss it?
When the intent is grasped, the mind’s activity ceases—
What observation could contemplate it?

Thus Tiantai said:
The mouth seeks to speak but words fail,
The mind seeks to think but thought vanishes.
All dharmas merge in emptiness,
All thoughts extinguish in stillness.
Originally not existent—
Who would insist on calling it nonexistent?

What clamor is there to clamor?
What silence is there to silence?
If one knows that self and other are mysteriously one,
Then there is no place that is not a bodhimandala.
Why chase after clamor among the crowd,
Or scatter solitude in empty valleys?

Those who seek stillness through movement
Are like monks who love to twist willow branches;
Those who seek kinship by fleeing enmity
Are like those who loathe cages yet delight in pens.

If one knows knowing as stillness,
This is not knowing without cause—
Like a hand grasping a *ruyi*,
It is not a hand without a *ruyi*.
If one knows self-knowing,
This is also not knowing without cause—
Like a hand making a fist,
It is not a hand that is not a fist.

Neither knowing stillness nor self-knowing,
Yet not without knowledge—
The self-nature is inherently luminous.
Thus it differs from wood and stone.

The hand does not grasp a *ruyi*,
Nor does it make a fist,
Yet it is not without a hand—
The hand rests naturally,
Thus it differs from a rabbit’s horn.

No afflictions to remove in the past,
No self-nature to guard in the present,
No Buddha to become in the future—
This is called the severance of the three times,
The purification of the three karmas.

The moment I raise a thought, it already belongs to the past;
Before I raise a thought, it is still the future.
The future mind is not the past mind—
Where, then, is the present mind?

If the scholar knows that the instant a thought arises,
It is already unattainable—
A thing of the past, the past is empty,
The future is also void—
Then the future Buddha is the present Buddha,
For thoughts do not abide in the present.
Thought after thought aligns—
Thought after thought becomes Buddha.
This is the first expedient gate.

**Master Huiri:**
A single stride outshines the Four Seas,
A single fist topples Mount Sumeru.

The ranks of Buddhas and Patriarchs cannot retain him—
Again he blows the fish-pipe, moored at Luoyang Bay.
No need to seek the mind, only to still perceptions.

Though the Third Patriarch evaded the golden hook,
Unawares he had already swallowed the red coin.
Huiri is not so: no seeking truth, no stilling perceptions—
Riding backward on an ox, he enters the Buddha Hall,
A single note from the herdsman’s flute and heaven-and-earth expand.
Bowing to that yellow-faced Dharma-true one.

Layman Budai:
I have a cloth sack,
Empty, unobstructed by space.
Unfurled, it pervades the ten directions;
Folded, it reveals freedom.

A single bowl gathers meals from a thousand homes,
A lone body roams ten thousand miles.
Few with clear eyes see me—
I ask the way of the white clouds’ heads.

Master Baiyang Shun:
Good things come heaped and piled,
No need to contrive or arrange.
Yellow leaves fall in the forest, swept away by water;
White clouds in the ravine, rolled back by wind.

A single cry from a cold goose severs the thread of longing,
The frost-bell’s first toll shatters my mountain.
Yet Baiyang has a way beyond others—
All night he pokes dead ashes in the cold brazier.

Monk Run:
Illusion dissolved, truth returned, ten thousand burdens empty,
The river-sands of beings and sages are originally the same.
Deluded, all are moths plunging into flame;
Awakened, they are cranes freed from the cage.

A slice of moonlight divides its shadow among a thousand ravine streams,
A lone pine’s voice endures the winds of the four seasons.
Only when heart after heart seals in perfect accord
Does one awaken from the lifelong sleep of dreams.

Master Huanglong:
All the ancients’ expedient means
Open a single path for all people.

Having found the path of entry, one must seek the path of exit.
To climb a mountain, reach its summit;
To enter the sea, plumb its depths.
Climb not to the summit, and you will not know the vastness of the cosmos;
Plumb not the depths, and you will not know the abyss of the deep blue sea.
Once you know its breadth and depth,
With a single stride you cross the four great seas,
With a single strike you topple Mount Sumeru.
Let go and arrive home—none recognize you,
As magpies clamor and crows cry in the cypress tree.

Master Anpi:
A solitary peak stands aloof, untangled by vines.
A slice of moon traverses the sky, white clouds drift freely.
Seeing one’s nature, do not cling to Buddha;
Awakening to the Dao, do not rely on a master.
Before the eye-root’s dust:
As objects seen in dreams, as images beheld in illusion;
Before the ear-root’s dust:
As wind heard in empty space, as the cries of birds;
Before the mind-root’s dust:
As ice and snow melting in hot water, as gold and iron smelted in fire.

Master Zizai:
“Mind is Buddha” is a remedy for those without illness;
“Not mind, not Buddha” is a cure for the afflicted.
Dispel delusion without extinguishing illumination,
Guard stillness without clinging to emptiness.
Practice with constancy, and true vision will naturally arise.
Clinging to emptiness while rejecting form—
How can one attain neither form nor emptiness?
Dwelling in non-being while rejecting being—
How can one speak of neither being nor non-being?

Master Wunian:
Thought is not inherently existent, nor must it be absent.
One who understands this principle is called “thoughtless.”
As a lost traveler mistakes east for west,
Though direction does not change, ignorance deludes.
So too is mind called “thought,” though mind itself does not move.
Freedom from entanglement is liberation;
Removing afflictions brings purity.
Seeing the five aggregates as empty is profound prajñā;
Attaining the quiescence of one mind is great nirvana.

Master Damao:
To know the nature of all buddhas,
Seek it within the conduct of sentient beings;
To know the undecaying nature,
Seek it amid the flux of the ten thousand things.
The mind that seeks to cease thought stirs more vexation.
If you know that knowing is fundamentally empty,
Knowing itself becomes the gateway to all wonders.

Master Congyue:
How clear the ears and eyes,
Dwelling in the secluded valley.
Autumn wind enters the ancient pine,
Autumn moon rises over the cold waters.
The monk who seeks truth here is deluded—
Two gibbons dangle their four tails.
Intrinsic nature is no-thing;
No-thing is called quiescence.
Yet people chase after sense-objects,
Thoughts following one after another,
Unable to quiesce in the present moment.
Turn the light around, return the gaze—
The original landscape flashes before you,
And the one vanishes, the six dissolve.

Master Xingkong:
To forget both mind and dharma is still to linger in delusion;
To transcend both form and dust is yet to leave traces of dust.
A hundred birds do not come, spring passes again—
Who is the one dwelling in the hermitage?

Truth and convention both extinguished, the two truths remain;
Emptiness and being both forgotten, the one taste is ever manifest.
For true emptiness is never without being,
And being is discerned as illusory through emptiness.
Being is never without emptiness,
And emptiness clarifies being.
Emptiness that is not empty is emptiness without annihilation;
Being that is not being is being without permanence.
The four attachments once extinguished, the hundred negations are dispelled.

Master Shui’an:
To hide the body is neither near nor far;
To cast off the body is to be without reliance, yet perfectly at ease.
The ancient mirror needs no polishing to reflect itself,
As mist and smoke gently moisten the autumn light.
To realize emptiness is to become real;
To grasp the self is to become hollow.
Apply medicine to match the illness;
When there is no illness, remove the medicine.

Master Changqing:
The gateway to the Dao requires the two methods of cessation and contemplation.
Principle-obstacles obstruct right knowledge and vision;
Affair-obstacles perpetuate the cycle of birth and death.
Without the method of great contemplation, how can principle-obstacles be removed?
Without the method of great cessation, how can affair-obstacles be overcome?
Through mind one awakens to the Dao, yet the Dao is not mind;
Through the eye one attains clarity, yet clarity is not the eye.
Cut off delusive thoughts and abandon attachments—
Trace back to what is not to see inherent nature and realize the Tathāgata.
Trace back to what is—
By what is not, liberate from all fetters;
By what is, illuminate all darkness,
And it is the great sun of wisdom.

Master Yuanjue:
To dispel delusion in pursuit of awakening
Is to mistake delusion for the hammer that forges awakening.

Clinging to the sacred while despising the mundane,
One fails to see the mundane as the crucible that refines the sacred.
When sacred and mundane both dissolve, delusion and awakening both forgotten—
How then to speak of midnight’s rosy clouds adorning jade elephants,
Or dawn’s five-colored mists veiling the mountain peak?

Master Huangyao:
When the sun rises, light pervades the world,
Yet empty space is never illuminated;
When the sun sets, darkness pervades the world,
Yet empty space is never darkened.
The realms of light and dark contend and vie,
While empty space’s nature remains vast and self-abiding.
The mind of buddhas and sentient beings is likewise.

If one perceives buddhas as pure, radiant forms of light,
And sentient beings as defiled, dim, and dull—
Even after kalpas as numerous as Ganges’ sands,
Enlightenment will never be attained.
Ordinary people all follow conditions to generate the mind;
If one wishes to be free of conditions, one must forget the mind.
When the mind is forgotten, conditions dissolve;
When conditions dissolve, delusion ceases.
Seeing good approach, there is no joyful heart;
Facing myriad evil forms, there is no aversion.
Only when the mind is forgotten, merging with the Dharma-realm,
Does one attain true freedom.

Mind without absence is called illumination;
Desire without extinction is called forgetting.
Forgetting and illumination are one yet two,
Two yet one.
When forgetting, the mind is serene,
Yet never fails to illuminate;
When illuminating, not even a mote of dust arises,
Yet never fails to forget.
This is true forgetting, true illumination.

Scholar Zhang Zhuo

The radiant light silently illumines across the Ganges’ sands,
All beings—ordinary and sacred—dwell within my home.
The moment a single thought does not arise, the whole body manifests;
The instant the six senses stir, clouds obscure the view.

Severing afflictions only breeds new illness,
Pursuing true suchness is ever delusion.
Following conditions without clinging yields no attainment—
Nirvāṇa and saṃsāra are but empty flowers.

Master Nanhua Yu

Seeking birth when birth itself is unborn,
Fearing extinction when extinction is but momentary.
Eyes’ seeing falls short of ears’ hearing,
Mouth’s speech cannot match the nose’s telling.
Grasping the moon in water, seeking the head in a mirror,
Carving the boat to find the sword, riding the ox to seek the ox.
Empty flowers and mirages, dreams and illusions—
With a single stroke, let them all go; when you wish to cease, cease at once.

Already singing village songs of wine and fields,
Where there seems no elegance, elegance arises of itself.

Buddha and sentient beings—
Originally without distinction.
The awakened mind turns things,
And all things return to mind: this is the Buddhas.
The deluded mind turns toward things,
Blindly following their course: this is sentient beings.

Wu Gouzi

All Buddhas of the three times reside within this very body,
Yet obscured by qi’s habits and turned by external realms, one loses the way.
If within the mind there is no mind, this is the past Buddha;
Abiding in stillness, unmoved—this is the future Buddha;
Responding to conditions, adapting to things—this is the present Buddha;
Pure and undefiled—this is the Buddha of Purity;
Entering and exiting without attachment—this is the Buddha of Spiritual Powers;
Roaming freely everywhere—this is the Buddha of Freedom;
The mind undimmed—this is the Buddha of Light;
The Dao-mind firm—this is the Indestructible Buddha;
Transforming in myriad ways, yet ever the One True.

Dharma Master Fachang

The Buddha comes from non-action,
And to non-action returns.
The Dharmakāya equals empty space,
Abiding where the mind is absent.
Thoughts return to no-thought,
Dwelling returns to no-dwelling.
Coming for the sake of sentient beings,
Going for the sake of sentient beings.
The pure ocean of true suchness,
Its essence ever still and constant.
Let the wise reflect deeply—
No more doubts should arise.

The Buddha’s body is fundamentally non-action,
Yet deluded feelings falsely discriminate.
The Dharmakāya equals empty space,
Never having birth or extinction.
With conditions, the Buddha appears in the world;
Without conditions, the Buddha enters extinction.
Everywhere transforming sentient beings,
Like the moon reflected in water.
Neither eternal nor annihilated,
Neither born nor extinguished.
Birth has never been born,
Extinction has never been extinguished.
When insight penetrates the profound,
Naturally, no dharma can be spoken.

Bao’en Yi Gong

Yanruo Dadu, mistaking his reflection for his head—
was he not carrying his head in search of his head?
When truly deluded, the head was never lost;
upon awakening, nothing was gained.
Why? Because delusion calls it loss,
awakening calls it gain.
Gain and loss lie with the person—
what do they have to do with movement or stillness?

Qingliang Guoshi
The supreme Dao originates in the heart-mind;
the heart-mind’s dharma abides in non-abiding.
The non-abiding heart’s essence and appearance are quiescent,
neither existent nor empty, neither arising nor ceasing.
Sought, it cannot be grasped;
abandoned, it cannot be parted from.
When deluded by the present moment, confusion and suffering arise in profusion;
when awakened to true nature, emptiness and clarity pervade all.
Though "the heart-mind is the Buddha,"
only those who realize it know this.
Yet to have realization and knowledge
is for the sun of wisdom to sink into the realm of being;
if there is no illumination and no awakening,
then dark clouds obscure the gate of emptiness.
Only when not a single thought arises
are past and future cut off, illumination stands alone,
and all things—self and other—are thus.
No delusion or awakening remains to depend on the opposition of truth and illusion.
To seek truth by eliminating illusion
is like chasing a shadow and exhausting the body.
To realize illusion as truth
is like resting in shade and stilling the shadow.
If the heart-mind does not illumine illusion,
then illusory thoughts are entirely relinquished.
If one abides in effortless quiescent knowing,
then all actions naturally arise.
Thus, awakening is quiescence without quiescence,
true knowing is knowing without knowing.
With the non-dual heart-mind of knowing and quiescence,
one accords with the wondrous principle of empty and existent fused.
Non-abiding, non-attachment,
neither grasped nor contained,
right and wrong both forgotten,
subject and object both transcended—
even this transcendence is quiescent,
and prajñā manifests before one.
Heart-mind after heart-mind becomes Buddha;
there is no heart-mind that is not the Buddha’s heart-mind.
Everywhere the Dao is realized;
there is no dust that is not the Buddha-land.
Thus, illusion and truth, self and other—
grasp one and all are gathered.
Heart-mind, Buddha, sentient beings—
all are undifferentiated and equal.
Know this:
When deluded, people follow dharmas,
and though the ten thousand dharmas differ, people are not the same.
When awakened, dharmas follow people,
and though each person has one wisdom, all realms are fused.
Words exhausted, thoughts ceased—
what is cause, what is effect?
The essence is fundamentally still and solitary—
who is the same, who is different?
Only by forgetting concerns and becoming empty and bright,
by merging and harmonizing in tranquility,
does one resemble the moon’s reflection in water—
empty yet visible;
the mirror of the heart-mind without thought—
illuminating yet ever empty.

Fazhen Chanshi
Willow hues hold mist, spring’s beauty returns;
a solitary peak stands tall, myriad blossoms vie in splendor.
White clouds drift aimlessly, no heart-mind remains;
all around, green mountains remain fundamentally unmoved.
The fisherman casts his line—
a stream’s chill hue never fades;
the wild ferry lies empty—
for ten thousand ages, the emerald pool is clear as a mirror.
Shadow follows form, echo follows sound—
to remove afflictions and seek nirvana is like leaving the body behind.

Ximing Chanshi
Leaves scatter from the forest, heaven and earth herald early autumn.
What need to distinguish the intent of the Western Patriarch
or seek further?
If one deeply understands this principle
and thoroughly penetrates its source,
one knows that all activity and stillness, conduct and repose,
walking, standing, sitting, lying—
each accords with the Dao,
every thought turns toward its origin.
Did the Patriarch not say:
Delusion gives rise to stillness and disturbance;
awakening has no preference, no aversion.
Gain and loss, right and wrong—
all are cast aside at once.
Then who is right, who is wrong?
Who is deluded, who is awakened?
It is only people who generate peculiar views,
observing great and small, grasping being and non-being.
The solitary radiance of the spiritual root
refuses to bear witness;
the solitary fullness of the heart-moon
creates its own opposition—
how is this different from abandoning one’s father at home
or forgetting the pearl within one’s robe?
Thus, on the path of bodhi, thorns grow into forests;
in the emptiness of liberation, delusive clouds obscure the sun.

Doushuai Chanshi

Beneath Dragon Peace Mountain, roads crisscross;
Within the Tushita Palace, pavilions rise in layers.
Though not of heaven, nor of the human realm,
those who arrive find peace, all thoughts forgotten.
The skillful walker moves not both feet;
the skillful entrant stirs not the double doors—
naturally they scorn the dust of dreams,
heedless of time dissolving in stillness.
Yet even so, I ask: is there still a matter beyond?

Wu Gen Jiu Ri says:
*Let not the stone before the cliff be cast down,
to shatter the clouds that shade the world below.*

Chan Master Daoying

To speak of the Dao: speech is not permitted,
silence is not permitted.
Even if speech and silence are both forgotten,
it remains untouched.
Why?
The radiance of the ancient Buddhas,
the grace of the former worthies—
each emerges from desirelessness, from non-reliance.
At times, solitary and sheer, towering beyond grasp;
at times, all-embracing, merged beyond perception—
never fixed in one place,
never bound to either end.
No right, no wrong;
no "is," no "is not."
Gain brings no gain,
loss brings no loss.
Not a hairbreadth apart,
not a strand of hair altered.
The ancient path, luminous and clear,
belongs not to the subtle or profound.
Seen face-to-face, it is grasped and gone in an instant,
neither abiding in the central place
nor straying onto crooked paths.
Not pursuing great or small,
how could it tread narrow trails?
Turning back, none is met;
facing forward, none is matched.
A single thought surveys all—
vast, empty, still.

This essential teaching
the thousand sages do not transmit.
Directly knowing it,
one transcends in the very place.

Thus, to conceive of it as bare and unadorned is easy;
to conceive of it as bright and distinct is hard.
If these are the hands and feet of one’s original portion,
let go what cannot be reclaimed.
Each emits light, each manifests signs,
each severs near and far, cuts through entanglement.
On the pivot of the moment, nothing lingers;
in speech, nothing is revealed.
Thoroughly stirred, it cannot be muddied;
struck whole, it cannot be shattered.
In the end—what is it?
So wondrous!
So extraordinary!

Friends in the Dao, do not seek to recognize its face,
nor fix it with a name,
nor search for its dwelling place.
Why?
It has no dwelling place,
no name,
no face.
The moment you pursue it with a single thought,
you are separated by ten lives, five lives—
better to let it be free:
when it arises, it arises;
when it abides, it abides.
Then "natural" is not natural,
"thusness" is not thusness,
"profound stillness" is not profound stillness,
"decay" is not decay.
No birth to cling to, no death to fear,
no Buddha to seek, no demon to spread.
It does not meet with bodhi,
does not dwell with affliction,
accepts no dharma,
rejects no dharma.
No place, yet nowhere absent;
neither apart nor not apart.
If you can be thus,
you see Śākyamuni as Śākyamuni,
Dharma as Dharma.

Master Huì of Táiwèn:
The eighty-four thousand gates of pāramitā stand ever open;
the buddhas of the three thousand great thousand worlds,
each and every one, expound the Dharma.
They do not speak of being,
do not speak of nonbeing,
do not speak of neither being nor nonbeing,
do not speak of both being and nonbeing.
Why?
Beyond the four propositions, beyond the hundred negations.
When you meet it, few raise their eyes to know.

Yesterday’s frost-laden wind leaked its tidings,
yet plum blossoms still adorn the cold branches.

Master Huì of Huìlín:
Not environment, nor mind—
call it Buddha, and it sinks from sight.
Within it, no ranks exist from the outset;
beware of seeking where no ranks are found.
Seek not at all, and the fault runs deeper still.
Shatter the Cloud Gate rice-sack,
then you’ll know red earth as gold.
