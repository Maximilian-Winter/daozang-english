**Record of the Lingji Ancestral Temple**
The term "ancestor" speaks of origins. My surname is Xu, descendant of King Yan of Xu, a lineage that served the Tang dynasty. When the Five Dynasties fell into chaos, I received the Son of Heaven’s command to guard Jinling. In the second year of Kaiyun of the Jin (945 CE), the Min king Wang’s internal strife erupted into war. I then led cavalry commanders Zha, Bian, and ten thousand riders to defect to Jianzhou. The following year, I seized Fuzhou, took the western path through the Xi gorge, scaled the Deer Ridge, and advanced from Nantai County to capture Zhang and Quan. A villager surnamed Hu knelt before my horse and said: "Just now, routed soldiers wrought havoc, becoming the people’s unforeseen enemy. Today, we behold the royal army once more. If Your Lordship pities their innocence and revives them with a breath, sparing them from calamity, no virtue could be greater."

The troops halted and formed ranks. I instructed my sons Shang and Bo to join forces and, by military discipline, blunt the enemy’s assault. The rebels perished in battle, and the people found respite. When the army withdrew, the elders still harbored the lingering affection of *tiepao*. I pondered Li Yushi’s counsel on leniency and, from horseback, devised a plan, knowing the time had come to act with them. The following year, I indeed escaped transformation amid the snares of the ranks. My spirit, undiminished, descended to become a deity upon the southern slope of Biefeng. Initially, there was no temple—only a thatched hut and a wooden incense burner. Yet during the seasonal sacrifices of *Fu* and *La*, the rites were never neglected.

In the spring of the eighth year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty (the year *guiwei*), no rain fell, and seeds remained unplanted in the earth, causing the stewards deep concern. In the second month, on the auspicious day *wuz*i, divination was performed before me. Before the old auspicious shrine lay a deep pool, its circumference spanning four or five *zhang*, its depths unfathomable. Suddenly, clouds and *qi* surged upward, lingering without dispersal the entire day. At dawn the following day, fierce winds, thunder, lightning, and hail arrived in unison, and the people rejoiced greatly.

Three days later, at first light, Zai Shengming came to the shrine to seek an answer. He beheld the shrine swept away, reduced to a ruin by floodwaters. Filled with astonishment and doubt, he prepared incense and submerged it in the pool, offering prayers. Suddenly, a wooden incense burner emerged from the water’s center, its ash unsullied by moisture—sure proof of a divine presence. In an instant, twin dragons coiled in the distance, bearing the shrine westward upon their wings, until they reached the islet where the mountains barred the stream’s flow. This islet was formerly called Incense Burner Peak. Crows and magpies took flight, calling as if to welcome something. Paper money marked the boundary, and a rare fragrance suffused the air. By night, the auspicious glow of heavenly lamps appeared; by day, the sound of metal and stone resounded. The villagers marveled and, seizing the opportunity, built a temple upon the site. Later, the temple produced the auspicious sign of *lingzhi*, and so it was named the Ancestral Temple of Zhi Islet.

In the first month of the first year of Yongxi, on the day *dingmao*, the construction was completed and the matter reported. The benefactor was a man of Henan surnamed Fang, named Jue, who oversaw the work.

In the second year of Qiandao, *bingxu* (1166), Fang Jue’s grandsons—Xun, Gan, and Zhong—presented the matter to Prefect Feng Li of the prefecture, who inscribed the plaque with the four characters *Hujing Ganying* ("Protecting the Realm, Responding to Devotion"). In the third year of Xining, *gengxu* (1070), Zhang Guan of Hejian, Chen Pengchu of Yingchuan, Lin Huaixian of Jinan, and Huang Ban of Jiangxia reported the affair to Cheng Shimeng, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, who memorialized the throne. At the time, the Wang clan of Banshan held power in the court, and the people were burdened by the *Green Sprouts* corvée, so the matter was not addressed.

In the eighth year, *yimao* (1075), when Liu Yi, a native of the prefecture, governed Guizhou, Jiaozhi raiders invaded the border and seized Qin and Lian prefectures. Liu Shu, then serving alongside Zhou Ruli in the autumn bureau, prayed to me, and I manifested the numinous power of Mount Gong. The raiders indeed retreated. Liu Shu then submitted a full report. During the Yanshao era, my hidden merits became most conspicuous: the victory of Han Zhongwu at Dayi Garrison and the achievements of Monk Yuan of Wu’an. Xue Bi, the Pacification Commissioner of the circuit, memorialized the throne during the Duanping era.

In the first year of Duanping, *jiawu* (1234), Zhou Shuo, Supervisor of the Left Treasury, and Zhou Sui, Prefect of Chaozhou, detailed the matter and submitted it to the chief minister Li Zongmian. In the third year, *bingshen* (1236), in the tenth month, He Cong, the military commissioner of the circuit, was appointed Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, and the imperial decree was finally obtained. In the second year of Jiaxi, *wuxu* (1238), the edict was issued, bestowing the title *Lingji* ("Numinous Aid") and adding honorifics. The gods rejoiced, the people celebrated, and their virtue was thus made manifest.

Since the dynasty began selecting officials through the examination system, I have been enrolled in the register of successful candidates. Those from my hometown who passed the examinations soared like meteors, surpassing all other counties south of the river. Thereafter, the literary flourishing grew ever greater: those listed on the *Huangjia* (imperial examination roster) were numerous, as were those selected in the highest ranks of the Southern Palace. Their reputations resounded, their ranks were lofty—some held office in the autumn court, some oversaw the imperial treasury, some governed flowery domains, some instructed the floating lords. Even those with minor ranks could be counted by the cartload or measured by the bushel.

Later, Fang Ce of the Henan Fang clan, styled Zhu, and Wang Jie, styled Lang, each passed the imperial examinations through their literary talents. Both had divined their success through dreams at my shrine and received their reward. Such is the breadth of my merit among the people—far beyond the hearsay of idle gossip, achieved not in a single morning or evening.

Since the temple’s founding in the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, counting the *jiazi* cycles, over two thousand four hundred years have passed. Initially dismantled to become a village altar, its foundation lay by the banks of Qingbu Stream. It was later relocated to the east of the lane, where the present Lingji Palace now stands. The entire household, encircled by devotion, received celestial favor and titles:

I, *Zhizheng*, was canonized as *Jiutian Jinque Mingdao Dade Dashian Xianling Puji Zhenren* ("Perceiver of Truth, Great Immortal of the Ninefold Golden Towers, Illuminating the Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Numinously Efficacious and Universally Beneficent Perfected One"), and enfeoffed as Jiang Wang.

Zhong, *Zhie*, was canonized as *Jiutian Yuque Xuanhua Fujiao Shangxian Zhaoling Bojie Zhenren* ("Perceiver of Righteousness, Supreme Immortal of the Ninefold Jade Towers, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teaching, Illustriously Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One"), and enfeoffed as Rao Wang.

Our father, named Wen, was enfeoffed as Qi Wang and canonized as *Zhongwu Zhenren* ("Loyal and Martial Perfected One").

Our mother, née Tian, was canonized as *Renshou Xianfei* ("Benevolent and Longevous Immortal Consort").

My wife, née Tao, was enfeoffed as *Jingguo Furen* ("Lady of Jing State") and canonized as *Shunzhu Renhui Xianfei* ("Compliant and Assisting, Benevolent and Kind Immortal Consort").

Zhong’s wife, née Xu, was enfeoffed as *Weiguo Furen* ("Lady of Wei State") and canonized as *Shanzhu Ciyi Xianfei* ("Kindly Assisting, Compassionate and Virtuous Immortal Consort").

Our five sons:
- **Chawen Hui**, *Yong’an Marshal and Guardian*, canonized as *Yuanshuai*.
- **Bian Hao**, *Wu’an Marshal and Guardian*, canonized as *Yuanshuai*.
- **Wei Cen**, *Military Commissioner and Left Gate Marshal*.
- **Zhao Zhong**, *Commander-in-Chief and Right Gate Marshal*.
- **Diao Yanneng**, *Commander of the Vanguard and Marshal of the Army*.

Our four elder brothers—*Zhigao*, *Zhixun*, *Zhijian*, and *Zhixun*—were all enfeoffed as kings and received sacrifices in the temples of Jinling. Their origins and generations are fully recorded in the *History of the Five Dynasties*. This temple is the progenitor of all such shrines. *Zu* ("ancestor") signifies a beginning—how could one forget the origin and obscure its source?

The founding and history of the Ancestral Temple have been recounted above. All things decay with time, and without repair, they decay further. Thus, we built halls of wood and chambers of stone, planning for a hundred thousand years. The merits were vast, the expenses great, and the names and contributions of the benefactors remain on record. This occurred in the year *dinghai* (1287), the twenty-fourth year of the Zhiyuan era, on the day *dingwei* of the eleventh month.

Twelve years later, the grand gate was restored, and the plaque was inscribed with the name *Zhiyu Zumiao* ("Ancestral Temple of Zhi Islet"). As the old stele had eroded, I descended this stele and inscribed it at the request of the gentlemen of the Henan Fang clan—Zhuangyou, Fengwu, and Sixi.

**Inscription:**
The waters flow—trace their source.
The leaves of trees—seek their root.
When the source runs deep, the streams diverge.
When the root stands firm, the leaves flourish.
This is the Ancestral Temple, revered shrine of this land.
Here it has stood for a hundred thousand years.
Its merit rivals the sun and moon, its virtue the heavens and earth.
Its names and titles are preserved in history.
Of old, its temple was called *Ming* ("Illustrious"), and the gods were divine.
Now, its celestial rank is that of immortal and transcendent.
Its blessings have been bestowed upon the people—
How shall we repay them? With offerings of orchids and ferns.
In the year *dinghai*, the temple was renewed.
Twelve years later, our gates were grandly restored.
Inscribed upon this stele, carved into stone,
Its origins recounted, its sacrifices transmitted.
Like the sacred peaks, its fame resounds thrice.
For ten thousand myriad years, we pray for the sagely lord.

**Record of Lingji Palace**
My surname is Xu, descended from the Ying clan. The physician Boyi of the Xia dynasty was enfeoffed in Xu, in the land of Xiapei Tong County. The state flourished through the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties, each era marked by great merit. King Yan of Xu governed with such renown for benevolence and righteousness that he received the auspicious omen of a crimson bow and vermilion arrows. When King Mu of Zhou heard of this, he attacked Xu. Unwilling to let his people suffer, King Yan retreated to the foot of Wuyuan Mountain in Pengcheng, naming the mountain after himself. There he dwelled. For over three thousand years, generations of descendants—eminent figures and towering scholars whose deeds are recorded in history—all trace their lineage to King Yan, my ancestor.

My family served the Tang dynasty for generations, all holding high office. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, heroes and warlords arose in swarms, carving up the land and plundering one another. By the Son of Heaven’s decree, I was left to guard Jinling. Overseeing more than twenty prefectures south of the Yangtze, I eased taxes and relaxed levies, ensuring the army was well-provisioned. The tribes of the forests and caves adhered to the laws, holding fast to their oaths even unto death. The elderly and children played and wandered, joining hands to sing in celebration. Above, none bore grievance; below, none harbored enmity. The people of the Jiangnan region owed their lives to me. My merit and virtue shone as brightly as the sun and moon—though ages may pass, they cannot be erased.

In the second year of the *Kaiyun* era of the Jin, the King of Min, surnamed Wang, lost his state and sought my aid. I led an army of ten thousand, advancing by both ship and foot. The prefectures of Min each surrendered their cities. The following year, I took Fuzhou and captured it. As the army reached the southern bank of the Xiajiang, we passed through Qingbu. The elders of the village came forth with jars of wine to welcome my troops, yet they lamented: "Just now, several hundred routed soldiers hid atop Biefeng Peak. Arrogant and violent, they were on the verge of rebellion. Had your royal army not arrived today, they would have overthrown our neighbors—how many of us would have remained?" I then turned my forces southward, scaling the peak, blunting their vanguard, breaking their strength, and annihilating their ringleaders. All their followers were captured. In the end, the rebels cast aside their armor and cheered in surrender, yielding without battle. The villagers bore no grudge; markets carried on as usual. Not a single trace of disturbance marred the fields or their harvests.

Thus, to this day, the mountainside is called "Battle Gate," marking the beginning of this event. When my army returned, the elders clung to me in admiration and reluctance, unwilling to let me depart. They cut thatch to build a hut north of Biefeng’s Dragon Gorge, where they painted my likeness and enshrined me in a temple. Morning incense and evening lamps were offered to pray for my longevity. My heart stirred with sorrow, and I swore to the people: "Next year, I shall depart this world and dwell here, bound in friendship with you all." When the time came, I manifested in dreams to reveal my spirit. No year brought famine, no people suffered premature death or plague. Divinations for rain and harvests were answered as swiftly as echo follows sound. In life, I could not fully bless my people; in death, to be venerated in their land and sustained by their offerings—this is no deceit against them.

As years passed and months turned, the temple fell into disrepair, its roof leaking and walls battered by wind, leaving no shelter. Yet suddenly, a towering cloud of qi arose, and a divine dragon coiled in protection. The wooden censer remained unbroken, my likeness stood firm and unyielding—all who witnessed it marveled. A villager named Fang Jue first established a temple in the wilds of Chuanyan, honoring me with the title "Guardian of the Realm, Moved by Devotion." This is the ancestral temple of Zhiyu.

In the early years of Xiangfu, customs shifted and the population flourished. The village elders consulted one another and unanimously agreed to rebuild the temple by the banks of Qingbu’s Yansi Stream. Once, the stream’s torrents surged violently, drowning fields and crops. With divine soldiers, I dredged its source and diverted its flow, ensuring it no longer harmed the people. Thus, the place is still called "Altar of the Community," where traces of the past remain.

As mulberry fields turn to seas and things transform with time, there were always villagers who gladly offered their land.

To the east of Dragon’s Head Peak, the land lay broad and level, its mountains and waters both exquisite. I divined an auspicious site and made my dwelling there. Magpies and crows lent their numinous presence; bees and serpents gathered in throngs. Paper money marked the sacred bounds, and wondrous fragrance assailed the senses. By night, heavenly lamps appeared as omens; by day, the sounds of metal and stone rang forth. The villagers, moved by these signs, built a temple there. They summoned carpenters, stonemasons, and laborers, who gathered with tools in hand beneath the shrine. They hewed planks, shaped deafening columns, and laid foundations; they fired tiles, molded bricks, and raised walls. In the ding-you year of the Zhenghe era, the work was completed with ease. My likeness was rendered with solemn majesty, its presence awe-inspiring. To this day, the elders still recall and recount these events.

As the temple was expanded and opened, its halls grew deep and vast—this was during the Longxing era. In the autumn of the gui-wei year, when the reign title was changed, the kitchens and storehouses were enlarged. By the spring of the bing-yin year of the second Kaixi reign, the main halls and courtyards were erected, their steps and ranks in perfect order. Lofty was its height, resplendent its newness. Its scale and design surpassed all former efforts. This was in the eighth year of the Xianchun era, the ren-shen year. Even now, the names of the benefactors inscribed upon the beams have not faded. I reflect upon the ancients, and their hearts truly align with mine. Thus, I dare not rest idle in my abode, for I must safeguard their descendants and the common folk—such is my bounden duty, and therein lies its merit.

As for the temples and images in the west, south, and north, all trace their origins to this place. Though they were later divided and dispersed, the passage of time has been long. If one were to question the white-haired elders, they would attest to how deeply my numinous virtue has taken root in the people.

During the calamity of the Jingkang era’s yang-nine misfortune, I protected the realm with divine soldiers, manifesting the spirit of the mountains and grasses, displaying the fluttering banners and swaying standards. The treacherous rebels were executed, and the Central Plains restored to peace. My deeds were reported to the imperial court. Though I was graciously honored by the sagely emperor, I did not cross southward in the end.

During the Jiaxi era, the local prefect of Chaozhou, Zhou Sui, along with village elders Zhang Shaobai and others, submitted a petition to the court. A rescript in gold ink bestowed praise, conferring the honorific title *Lingji* upon me, and the temple’s sacrificial register was splendidly renewed, its rites further augmented. Both gods and men rejoiced—how grand and glorious!

Yet of late, times have changed and affairs diverged; the swans of the central marsh have but newly alighted. As for the temple’s upkeep, who has leisure for such matters? The roof’s crown is askew, the foundation’s sandals unaligned—who will set them right? The walls crumble in shadow, the murals dim and obscure—who will restore them? If I do not exalt my illustrious deeds, widely manifesting them to the four quarters and proclaiming them to all of you, it would be remiss indeed. Should even a single meal be neglected, how could this remain a place of reverence and divine tranquility?

The villagers each consulted me on their affairs, seeking my brush to validate their fortunes. I revealed to them the oracle, saying: *The sixty-four slips correspond to the sixty-four hexagrams of the* Yijing. *Nothing in heaven or earth lies beyond the* Yijing. *As a book of divination, it determines fortune and misfortune—thus it decides all.* Having shown them the slips’ use, how could I dare take up my brush to compose a text, entrusting and charging you all? Let this be my proclamation: from this day forward, each of you must attend to your duties, setting the mean within your hearts. Plan and labor to establish your merits, that the ruined may be revived, the old made new.

I dare not claim sole credit for this glory; in initiating such affairs, the people’s livelihoods must be ordered. May they prosper in longevity and wealth, flourish and thrive—my blessings upon them are not slight. On an auspicious day in the eighth month, the autumn of the gengxu year, the work was completed, and I was asked to inscribe this record.

My royal grandfather ruled Wu and was enfeoffed as Prince of Qi, posthumously honored as *Zhongwu*. He had four elder brothers: the eldest, named Zhigao, inherited his father’s title and was later re-enfeoffed in Tang. The next, Zhixun, Zhijian, and Zhixun, all held power in Wu, were enfeoffed as princes, and each received temple sacrifices in Jinling. I am Zhizheng, enfeoffed as Prince of Jiang. My second brother, Zhikua, was enfeoffed as Prince of Rao. These events are recorded in history, and my hidden merits are detailed in the *Book of [Missing Character]*, under the *Bureau of Sacrifices*. I have partaken of this land’s offerings for over four hundred years, and shall continue for a thousand thousand more—beyond reckoning.

In this sagely dynasty’s era of unity, all within the realm offer allegiance. Heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, all partake of its virtue. Humbly awaiting the imperial grace, I look up to the throne’s decree. May this honor and favor meet expectations, and may the people never forget. Thrice I cry: *Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!*

**Eulogy:**
*Gentle and yielding, the Prince of Yan,*
*His filial descendants are blessed.*
*Unfailing in virtue,*
*He dwells in this land.*
*By winding Biefeng, east of Dragon’s Head,*
*The Lingji title bestowed—his merit to the people.*
*The new temple stands resplendent,*
*Its renown mighty and bright.*
*Shoulder to shoulder, the people gather,*
*Coming to offer and partake.*
*You, the people, do not doubt—*
*Abundant blessings descend.*
*I pledge this ode,*
*Carved in stone, unyielding.*

**On the Stele’s Reverse:**
Some say stele inscriptions must have a reverse side, while records need not. I know not what defines a *record* or a *stele*. Those called *records* without a reverse—such as the *Record of Music*, *Record of Learning*, *Records of History*, *Mourning Records*, *Biographies*—are not steles. Once engraved on stone, it is called a *stele*. Steles employ *ci* and *ming*, both mournful texts, while records do not. Long ago, Liu Zongyuan composed a stone inscription for his father, yet still inscribed the names of his disciples and followers on the reverse. The reverse of a *biao* began with Liu; the reverse of a *record* began with Xu, Prince of Jiang—who would dare question it?

**Stele’s Reverse:**
Heaven has not yet forsaken this culture, thus it lends me its hand to glorify virtue and illuminate goodness. It is your duty to assist me in this endeavor.

Recently, Lin Dongcun’s public assembly presented the words of Zhou Junxi: *"Shall we give birth to a Shen, or to a Yin?"* How profound! These words speak for me. Let them be carved at your side. When scholars ascend this hall and read this record, may they know what to strive for, and never bring shame upon the gods.

**Further:**
In life, one is a man; in death, a spirit. Those who serve the state and benefit the people deserve temple sacrifices. Temples with imperial decrees must have steles to record their deeds. Long ago, Liu Hou was demoted to the god of Luo Pool, and Han Wengong composed a record for him. Though I have emulated but a fraction of Liu Hou’s deeds, I lack his talent and cannot secure a Han Wengong to inscribe my story. How then shall I instruct posterity? I dare recount my own history; let those who come after Han Wengong record it.

**Record of Upholding Sincerity:**
The hall of Lingji bears the inscription *Cuncheng* ("Upholding Sincerity")—this is the god’s own brush. One day, a guest from afar arrived, seeking to borrow my numen. Clad in ceremonial robes, he entered the hall and found the god’s compositions—steles, inscriptions, records, and eulogies. Reading them carefully, he pondered deeply before withdrawing and asking: *"Why are only the two characters* Cuncheng *left uninscribed? Is it that they exist but remain uncarved?"* He sought my answer.

I, a spirit, cannot speak with my mouth, so I borrow brush and tongue to reply: *Sincerity is truth without falsehood. Human nature is inherently sincere; without sincerity, one cannot establish oneself. Between ruler and minister—this is sincerity. Between father and son—this is sincerity. Among brothers, husband and wife, friends—this is sincerity. Sincerity is one and the same; seek it within yourself, and it will endure. This is not the so-called* Way of Sincerity. *If one strives in this, though thunder roars above, one will not fear; though abysses yawn below, one will not tremble. There is no other reason—sincerity abides.*

If but a single word is untrue, a single phrase insincere, it is called delusion—it is not sincerity. How grave it is! In the darkest chamber, though one sees no one, every gesture, every glance, lays bare the heart’s depths. Those in whom sincerity abides are few indeed; those who speak falsely flow like a torrent. If a minister thus serves his lord, the lord will doubt. If a son thus speaks to his father, the father will doubt. When brothers, friends, husband and wife interact in such a manner, there is nowhere doubt does not arise. Once the mind of calculation sprouts, even gulls and crows will not alight—how much less men, how much less spirits and gods?

You, who do not deceive yourself, are true and without falsehood. Though you do not speak of sincerity, sincerity abides of itself. What need is there for ornamentation? The *Book of Changes* says: *"Guard against deceit to preserve sincerity."* The meaning of these two characters begins here. Do you understand? Remember this well.

**Record of the Hall of Familial Harmony**
The *Record of the Hall of Familial Harmony* serves to clarify human relationships. Among the great bonds of humanity, none is greater than loving one’s kin. To love one’s kin is for the father to be a father, the son to be a son, the elder brother to be an elder brother, the younger brother to be a younger brother, the husband to be a husband, the wife to be a wife. Thus, in the *Rites of Zhou*, the Grand Steward instructed the king to govern the myriad people through eight principles, the first of which was *"cherish one’s kin."*

Truly, for the father to be a father, the son a son, the elder brother an elder brother, the younger brother a younger brother, the husband a husband, the wife a wife—this is the foundation of human relationships. This is why the Grand Steward, in governing the myriad people, must first speak of cherishing one’s kin. Cherishing one’s kin is the root of teaching the people.

In the flourishing eras of the Three Dynasties, human relationships were clear among the high, and the common folk were harmonious below. Filial piety, kindness, fraternal love, and deference were practiced in harmony and humility. This was not a matter of cultivation or innate nature—it was the teaching of the sages, achieved without sternness.

From the Qin and Han onward, governance relied entirely on expediency, heedless of propriety. The ancient sages’ teachings on fostering kinship among the people were entirely abandoned. Thus, the great principles of order were not established, rites and righteousness were not illuminated, and the world daily descended into deceitful conduct, its ills beyond remedy. Fathers and sons no longer dwelt together, brothers could not tolerate one another, moral instruction was severed, and the customs of the state were corrupted, until the world no longer knew the meaning of kinship.

Thus, the people of antiquity were pure; the people of today are cunning. The people of antiquity were sincere; the people of today are shallow. Is it that the people of today are inferior to those of old? Only if a sage like Yao or Shun, like Yu or Tang, like King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, or Confucius were to arise, upholding and preserving their virtue, so that fathers and sons, brothers, husbands and wives might understand the meaning of their roles—only then might the customs of high antiquity be glimpsed again in our time.

Now, under the unified sagely court, governance is guided by benevolence. The sagely words are proclaimed, with filial piety and obedience foremost among the virtues encouraged for the people. Villages and towns are permitted to recommend those who exemplify these virtues, that they may be known.

The spirits rejoice, leaping and exclaiming in delight. Hearing of this from all directions, the people naturally transform themselves. Some are renowned for their chastity and fidelity, others for their virtuous widowhood. Gates of righteousness and arches of filial piety stand everywhere, each with its exemplars. Yet despite these offerings, the gods remain as if unhearing—knowing the customs remain corrupt, this brings shame upon the divine. The spirits cannot remain silent at such a time. They command the villagers to repair this hall. To the east of the main hall, a chamber is built to honor the kin of the gods, cherishing those they hold dear. Thus, it is named the Hall of Kinship and Harmony. When those who come to the temple ascend this hall, gaze upon these images, the heart of kinship and harmony may naturally arise within them.

The hall is completed, and this record is made to illuminate human relationships. From this day forward, let fathers be kind and instructive, let sons be filial and admonishing; let elder brothers be friendly and respectful, let younger brothers be reverent and obedient; let husbands be harmonious and righteous, let wives be gentle and upright. Strive on, strive on—may you not be unworthy of this hall’s name.

In the third month, the first day of the gui-chou, the jia-wu year of the Zhiyuan era.

*Record of the Divine and Efficacious Perfected Lord Jingxian of Biefeng.*

---

Moreover, to the east of the main hall of the Divine Efficacy Palace stands a hall, its plaque inscribed with the words *Kinship and Harmony*. A scholar, gathering his robes and ascending the hall, inquired: "Does *kinship and harmony* not refer to what the stele inscription calls ‘harmony with the kin of father and mother’—that is, one’s relatives?"

I replied: "Indeed."

He continued: "From great-grandfather down to great-grandson—are these not the kin of the father?"

I again replied: "Indeed."

He further asked: "The mother’s brothers are called uncles, and the mother’s cousins are called maternal cousins—are these not the kin of the mother?"

I again replied: "Indeed."

The scholar then sighed and said: "Man, born between heaven and earth, is the most spiritually endowed of creatures. What distinguishes him from birds and beasts is his knowledge of the kinship of his father’s and mother’s kin. If one knows the kinship of one’s father’s and mother’s kin, then harmony follows. Yet if one must rely on these two words—*kinship and harmony*—to be known among others, what is the true intent behind this?"

I said: "Well said! Do you understand? In today’s world, customs are governed by cunning and deceit, neglecting proper order, abandoning ritual and righteousness, discarding integrity and shame. That people still know harmony with the kin of their father and mother—I cannot yet believe it. Since the decline of the southern and northern courts, the way of filial piety and brotherly love has been lost. The *Tangdi* ode is forgotten, and the bonds of brotherhood are severed. Who still chants the *Lisi* ode, praising the virtue of descendants? Who still sings the *Taoyao* poem, celebrating the bride who brings harmony to her household? When fat lambs are prepared to hasten the arrival of uncles, when plump bulls are offered to welcome maternal kin—who still recites the *Famu* ode? Mencius said: ‘One without a heart of deference and yielding is not human.’ Thus, my heart is restless with what I desire, for silence is not permissible. To the people of Qin, the plumpness or leanness of the people of Yue stirs no concern in their hearts. Therefore, today’s discourse must be inscribed in writing, proclaimed in speech, and grounded in antiquity to enlighten them. Perhaps then the heavenly principle in human hearts—though as tenuous as a thread—may yet be unbroken, continuous, and still possess a way to be preserved and restored. This is what the ancients called *transformation*.

For the present age, nothing surpasses verbal transmission; for future generations, nothing surpasses the written word. Yet if the ancients had lived in a time when their Way could be practiced, there would have been no need for writing or speech. Speech arises only from necessity."

The scholar said: "Truly, it is so."

Here the translation follows:

---

Now, what is spoken of as the "Sacred Father," the "Sacred Mother," the "Sacred Elder Brother"—these are the divine kin, and do they not embody the spirit of the *Nansha* and *Tangdi* odes? As for the "Sacred Son," the "Sacred Nephew," the "Sacred Grandson," even the "Sacred Uncle" and the "Sacred Son-in-Law"—these too are divine kin, and do they not further reflect the essence of the *Zhongsi*, *Famu*, and *Taoyao* poems?

Yet though the divine call these kin, I know well they are but the kin of parents’ clans—kin in the eyes of the gods, but what of the common world?

I said: "How rigid, how foolish! You cite the *Record of Rites* in your question, yet I take you for a scholar

Once, it bore the title "Responsive to Devotion"; now, it is called "Numinous Aid"—such is the origin of its name. Yet what I speak of is not some power to sway men with fortune or misfortune, nor can I escape the duty of giving voice to its story. Though its shrine’s construction may be grand, surpassing that of former times, it is still insufficient to stir the gaze of later generations. Thus, we undertook a thorough renovation: repainting in five colors, sculpting the divine images, adorning them with yellow curtains and vermilion tables, lending them a measure of solemn dignity. By reckoning the years, this was the fifth year of Xianchun, in the cyclical year *jisi* (1269).

Alas! Man is the most spirited of all creatures, and who does not know the love of parents, cherishing them all their lives? Yet when it comes to ancestors, that love fades and is forgotten—how much more so for those of higher generations? Those who till the land, labor as artisans or merchants, or even aspire to be scholars, ought to trace the origins of their forebears, restoring their legacy rather than dismissing it as a relic of the past, fit only for idle chatter in some book-lined study. Though all who read and grasp the principles of virtue may be called scholars, I dare not compare ordinary men to the likes of Yi Yin, who rose from the fields of Shen, or Fu Yue, who was discovered while building walls—these were sages of their age. Even the emperors of the Han, who won the realm from horseback, welcomed the counsel of peddlers and butchers, inscribing their merits on bronze tripods and recording their names in history. How could such achievements be the sole province of those who read and understand the Dao?

In my humble view, when the Qin dynasty brought ruin, men took refuge in obscurity to preserve their lives. But today, the state nurtures scholars through education, summons the worthy by edict, and sets forth clear paths for advancement. Whether one is a farmer, artisan, or merchant, all may be drawn upward to become scholars. Thus, I dare to set down this account, to encourage those who would follow that path. Some may call this hall a village study, a place for warming the *Li Ke* sacrifices—such talk is but the prattle of rustics from Qi’s eastern wilds; pay it no heed.

In the third year of the *Dade* reign (1299), on the auspicious day of the mid-autumn month, the *Shefeng* Mountain Recluse wrote this. *Composed on behalf of the Elder of Dong Village, the Record of the Numinous Aid Palace.*

In my youth, I was driven by a bold and restless spirit, chasing after fame and office. I shouldered my provisions and traveled thousands of miles, visiting every majestic and wondrous place under heaven, leaving no trace of the ancients unexamined. Just as I was lost in reflection, a letter arrived from my scholar-friend Zhang Guilong, presenting me with *The Collected Writings of Numinous Aid*. He wrote: "In the indigo hills of Min, there stands an ancient temple called Numinous Aid. Its deities bear the surname Xu—one enfeoffed as the King of Jiang, the other as the King of Rao. Since the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, over four hundred years have passed, and their merits in aiding the state and pacifying the people, in warding off disasters and repelling calamities, are too numerous to recount. Yet of late, the temple has fallen into disrepair, unworthy of its divine radiance."

In the summer of the guisi year, Zhang Guilong, along with Shen Jianweng, Zhou Quan, Zhou Yong, Ming Linchun, Guo Yongweng, and Zheng Ruxian—seven men in all—jointly resolved to restore the temple and consulted the deities through divination. The gods manifested their presence, transforming brushstrokes into script, entrusting the task to them and renewing the edifice in radiant splendor. By the eighth month, the work was completed, and the deities again descended through the brush, recounting their deeds in sequence to compose this record. They revealed fortune and misfortune through hexagrams, exhorted loyalty, trust, ritual, and righteousness through prose and verse. Every word and phrase echoed the intent of Confucius and Mencius in their teachings for the ages. Such are the gods—wise, luminous, and upright—that even the brush of Ban Mengjian in the Western Capital, the *Three Capitals* of Zuo Taichong, the *Five Blessings* of Yang Ziyun, or the odes to sacred mushrooms and precious tripods, the hymns of yellow steeds and jade tablets, cannot compare. With gods so manifest, how could one dare to neglect them? The seven gentlemen, Zhang and his companions, reverently received the deities’ words and inscribed the record upon stone. The local scholar Lin Digong Yannian transcribed it, while I was entrusted with engraving the title in seal script.

In the twelfth month, the deities bestowed an ancient poem, saying: *"The stele now stands—today’s affair is for you to record, for such is the will of the gods."* Before I could take up my brush, they granted another poem, this one spanning ancient and modern times, sixty-five stanzas in all. Among them were the lines: *"Where the record endures, so too does the name; you may forget, but the gods do not."* I dared not refuse and thus composed this account of their words:

*Of old, there were sacrifices—now, there is transmission.*
*Of old, there were decrees—now, there is proclamation.*
*Ancient writings exhort to virtue.*
*The temple stands renewed, its affairs complete.*
*Rain and shine respond to the dual heavens.*
*The people pray with ever-deepening reverence.*
*This inscription I carve to endure ten thousand years.*
*May the world never forget, for virtue knows no change.*

**Record of the Yüqìng Hall Daoist Sanctuary**

Thus have I heard. The Buddha has a gatha:
*"All things arise from the mind—where in the mind are they sought?"*
And why? Because *"the mind itself is Buddha."*
What is Buddha? The *Shi* explains: *Fu* means "person."
If not for the person, there would be no embodied form.
Eternally real, without truth, without form,
Without patience, without hindrance, without substance,
Without coming or going, without entanglement—
Thus, thus, there is nothing to be settled.
Where is the person who does not understand?
One who exhaustively investigates the mind will find
The Buddha present at all times.
If the mind is otherwise, mere recitation of prajñā,
Empty talk, false guidance, greed for gain, and deceitful merit—
These are far inferior.
Even when the great chiliocosm crumbles,
How much less can the Buddha’s single sanctuary endure?

Since the Jingde and Xiangfu eras, the Buddha’s meritorious deeds have been renowned throughout the world. In every place, Daoist sanctuaries were established, each adorned with painted and sculpted Buddha images, revered with incense and offerings. Our village’s Yüqìng Hall is one such sanctuary. From the Kaixi bingyin year to the Yuanzhen bingshen year, reckoned by the Xia calendar, ninety-odd years have passed. Though not so distant in time, why has the sanctuary fallen into such disrepair, far inferior to its former state? Its roof leaks, its walls are breached, and damp rot lingers unaddressed.

Those who pass by—though they have eyes, none turn to look; though they have hands, none point in recognition. Truly, it is like the people of Yue gazing upon the sacrifices of distant tribes, unmoved by whether they are fat or lean.

Yet do they not reflect that the labors of the ancients—hauling water, carrying firewood—were not accomplished in a single morning or evening? Thus did the Buddha’s vow declare: "All buddhas arise in the world from mountain huts, unbothered by the nests of magpies upon their necks." With this illusory, fleeting body, I cannot idly occupy the land of kings or covet fine terrain. So I came to dwell in a stone chamber among the cliffs of Nan’an. The rise of Yüqìng Hall adds nothing to the Buddha’s realm, nor does its ruin take anything away. Yet by the Buddha’s wisdom, all are as these people. If such is the case, then their hearts are but yakṣas and rākṣasas—how can they be spoken to of the Buddha?

Master Zhigong of the Tang once met the Venerable Bodhisattva in the Yellow Cloud Mountains to expound the Dharma. A mendicant from Mount Song rose from his seat, bowed, and knelt to ask: "In the degenerate age, by what karma do sentient beings fall into *sahā*, suffering for kalpas on end? What expedient means can save them?" Zhigong replied: "In the latter days, those who do evil are many, while those who form karmic bonds are few." The Venerable Bodhisattva said: "These sentient beings bring it upon themselves." Truly, these words are true.

Now I broadly expound the Dharma for all beings, universally guiding them to awakening. If there are good men and good women who can arouse the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, and with the seven treasures filling worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges offer them in generosity—without deluded thoughts, without attachment, without retreat—then by this cause and condition, the adornment of the Buddha-land’s merit and virtue: can it be measured? I do not speak falsely. These are true words, real words. Listen carefully now, and take the Buddha as your heart.

Then he raised the Buddha’s verse again:
*"I have a single root of goodness,*
*All born within the heart."*
Do you understand? Thus it is said: *"The mind itself is the Buddha."*

In the third year of the Qiandao era, the Buddha bestowed upon Dingguang the title *Yuanying Putong Ciji Dashi Bodhisattva*, commonly called the White-Robed Sage Duke, or the Pan’gu Dingguang Buddha. I dare to compose this record of Yüqìng Hall for the Buddha, to be inscribed before the hall and exhort the world.

**Record of the Laibin Pavilion**

When the request was made for Han Wengong to compose an inscription, many lamented not seeing his true portrait. I alone rejoiced. Little did they know that Wengong’s words so vividly captured the spirit and form of his subjects that, by grasping his intent, the true likeness becomes clear before one’s eyes. This is why I rejoice—understanding Wengong’s purpose in establishing the pavilion.

Moreover, all things decay, yet literature alone endures. How true this is!

The lyrics of the Perfected One of Lingji were already exquisite in their beauty and perfection. Yet there remained a gap in the wall to be mended. Measuring it with a handboard, I found it to span over seventy tablets. Several gentlemen exhausted their efforts to complete it, then asked me to provide the painting. I considered it from afar and said: "A wall standing alone in the open sky is vulnerable to the ravages of wind and rain. In time, it will surely crumble. If you wish to preserve Wengong’s record, that would suffice. Should the painting perish, at least my record may endure. For later generations who seek to recount this, let it be said: it is the record that matters, not merely the record."

Now, in this era of sagely unity, the radiance of imperial might shines forth. The southern seas and all their realms present tribute. Gods and men rejoice, and the world once more knows peace. I dare to offer this painting as celebration for our time.

At its center stands a pavilion, its plaque reading *Laibin* ("Receiving Guests"). Before and behind it, scholar trees are planted, forming a "Scholar Tree Market." To its east and west stand two arches, one named *Yuejin* ("Delighting in the Near"), the other *Huaiyuan* ("Cherishing the Distant")—such are the names given to them. The peaks rise steeply, the crags loom dark and wild. The post road stretches far, and travelers tread its path without cease, one following another.

Here the forms of the southern seas’ myriad barbarian folk are depicted: two men mounted on elephants, called "barbarian officials." Beneath each barbarian official stands one who bears the seal. Four men, able to tame the elephants with golden hooks, are called "elephant slaves," also named "elephant lords." One man holds the banner of *Bearing Treasures* and stands to the left; another holds the banner of *Presenting Gifts* and bows to the right. Two chariots are drawn, with four charioteers, two umbrella-bearers, and two interpreters. The rest of their clansmen go barefoot, their torsos bared. Among them, thirty-six men gird themselves with five-colored woven cloth. The treasures they offer are called *Primordial Tortoises*, *Elephant Tusks*, *Great Bribes*, *Southern Gold*, *Penetrating Rhinoceros Horn*, *Patterned Armor*, *Kingfisher Plumes*, *White Silver*, and fragrant woods such as *sandal*, *aloes*, and *clove*. There are also rare marvels, strange wonders, exquisite luxuries, and precious rarities prized by the world—such as the *Jade Disc of He*, the *Pearl of Marquis Sui*, and corals like the *Stone-Crushing Coral Tree*. Some fashion platters of gold, vats of silver, basins of glass, curtains of true pearls, and pagodas of the Seven Treasures. Laden on carts and palanquins, wrapped in mats and felt bundles, they cross seas and scale ridges, arriving in leisurely procession to amass before the pavilion. Gleaming and resplendent, their colors shimmer and blur, intersecting and scattering in disarray—beyond all counting.

Those who present regional tributes must be organized as the *Zhou Rituals* prescribes under the *Huai Fang* office: eight officers, four treasurers, four scribes, four attendants, and four laborers, each with their assigned duties, their roles apportioned according to their abilities. Who would claim that only two supervisors—one chief and one deputy, with two attendants—could suffice? I observe these men: unless they possess talents surpassing ordinary men, how could they manage such affairs alone?

As for the pines encircling the paper mulberry grove and the willows flanking the road, they enclose an area of several dozen paces. Viewed from afar, their forms seem to sketch and vanish in an instant—distant, fleeting, evoking clouds and mountains ten thousand *li* away. The market bridge stretches like a sash, the creek flows like a ribbon of silk. Adorned with jade balustrades and vermilion railings, their carved craftsmanship exquisite, they stand tall and orderly, perfectly aligned. At their center rises a depiction of the Five Great Marshals—Zha, Bian, Zhao, and Diao—emerging in martial array. Valiant warriors lead the vanguard, cavalry guards the rear. Their radiance blazes, their martial presence crackles with authority. This is how the civil and martial deities manifest their power to govern the spirits of the underworld, repay the grace of the state above, safeguard this land below, and bestow blessings upon the people.

Yet this painting could not have been conceived in a single day or night; its creation was surely laborious. Though I admire it, I must compose this record in the manner of Master Wen to preserve its essence. What harm then if wind and rain erode it over time? Future gentlemen who attend to this place will surely read this record. In reading it, they will preserve the painting. In preserving the painting, they will extol the great dynasty’s majestic virtue—vast as the heavens’ height, profound as the earth’s depth, radiant as the sun and moon. As for the Nine Yi, Eight Di, Ten Jie, Six Man, and the remote frontiers beyond the seas—all are encompassed within its dominion. The seasonal tributes and envoys who hasten here as guests from every quarter cannot be fully chronicled by this record or this painting alone.

In the year of *tingtan*, on an autumn night when the sky was clear and the moon shone bright as day, the Hermit of Biefeng Mountain inscribed the events of the *Pavilion of Welcoming Guests* and its mural, carving it at the Lingji Palace.

**Inscription for the Qilong Mountain Spirit Shrine**

Qilong Mountain, an offshoot of Biefeng, bears a temple called the *Hall of Rain-Praying Kings*, also known as the *Dragon Gate Society*—the local shrine of the Lingji Palace’s royal procession. In the seventh year of the Song dynasty’s *Xuanhe* reign, the year *yisi*, from summer through autumn, no rain fell. The fields withered, the people toiled, and the fine grain faced ruin. No deity was left uninvoked—yet would they not heed our pleas?

Thus did the village elders and longtime residents speak among themselves: "To the east of the lane stands a temple, home to the deity known as the *Guardian of the Realm, Responsive and Efficacious King*—a spirit who wards off calamity and repels misfortune, whose blessings upon the people are vast, and whose divine aid has never been wanting. Now that the drought has grown dire, how can we delay the rites of sacrificial beasts and jade offerings?" On the *renshen* day of the seventh month, at the first light of dawn, they purified themselves and hastened in earnest to the temple courtyard to perform the sacrifices. The deity, moved by the people’s innocence, responded as swiftly as an echo or a shadow. In an instant, clouds and mist rolled in from all directions, thunder and lightning arrived, and a torrential downpour descended. Gazing toward the southern slopes of the mountain, they suddenly beheld a shimmering divine dragon, above which a yellow banner fluttered, emblazoned with the five characters: *Guardian of the Realm, Responsive and Efficacious King*. This title was none other than the former honorific of the present *Spirit of Lingji*.

Three days later, on *jiayin*, the skies cleared. That autumn, the harvest was abundant, the rice yield doubled, and the once-parched fields teemed with life, their granaries overflowing. The farmers and elders, facing north, leapt and danced in reverence, bowing and prostrating themselves, their joy unbounded, their hearts brimming with gratitude.

In the eleventh month, on the winter solstice, the sovereign personally established an altar upon the bend of Qilong Mountain, where monthly sacrifices were offered in repayment of the deity’s virtue. After a full cycle of sixty years, a temple was erected—its halls grand and spacious, a perpetual abode for the spirit, enduring through the ages. Qilong, a mountain of renown, was thus revealed as the site where the gods first manifested beneath its banner. When the people prayed for rain, rain came; the deity never failed in wisdom or response. The community petitioned the authorities, and so the temple was named the *Hall of Rain-Praying Kings*, also called the *Dragon Gate Society*. This is the very aspiration of the village’s finest and most loyal, those who cherish merit and renown.

For mountains, forests, valleys, and hills that bring forth clouds and wind or reveal strange phenomena are all called *shen*—spirits. According to the rites of sacrifice, they are duly recorded in the canon of worship. Now that this deity has manifested through Qilong’s timely rains, transforming barrenness into sweetness and turning pestilence into harmony, the people have been revived, their lives restored. For four hundred years, the temple has received offerings, and who among the people would dare forget or grow negligent in their devotion?

Yet time passes swiftly; the shrine has fallen into disrepair, its images faded, no longer befitting the radiance of the divine. The temple keepers, Lin Chun and others, having received abundant blessings from the spirit, reflected upon the past with a sense of unfulfilled duty. They consulted the villagers and resolved to restore it. When they prayed to the deity, the spirit accepted their sincerity. A divine bird descended to inscribe characters—seal script and clerical forms, strange and wondrous—at first indecipherable. They then requested a transcription in common script. The prose, composed in parallel couplets, could now be heard and understood, as if someone had been present all along, though none had noticed.

In the first month of the new *Yuanzhen* era, on an auspicious day, the people of neighboring hamlets east and west joined forces, pooling their resources in harmony. They commissioned artisans to complete the work, renewing the old with the new. On the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month, *guihai*—the day before the beginning of spring in the following year—on the morrow of *jiazi*, the project was finished. They entreated me to compose this record.

As for me, how could I dare to boast or flatter, seeking favor with others? Humbly, I have set down these words, that the deity may forever be venerated in this land and eternally receive its due offerings.

Long life, wealth, peace, and ease—these are the wishes of all people, and I shall surely grant them.

As for the noble lineage, titles, and origins of this deity, they are fully recorded on the stele of Lingji Palace to the east of the lane; even a hundred generations hence, they may be known. My name is carved in stone—what more need I say? I merely set this down to record the Lingji Traveling Shrine on Qilong Mountain, known as the Rain-Praying King’s Palace.

*Self-preface by Lingji Perfected Immortal of Biefeng.*

**Record of the Temple of Lingji Worthy and Sage King**

The stele of the Temple of Lingji Worthy and Sage King—this stele stands to ensure that his merit and virtue are never forgotten.

Since the *Xiangfu* era, the deity’s responses to prayers and exorcisms, along with his supplications at the eastern shrine of Longshou Temple, have led to his imperial enfeoffment as the Worthy and Sage of the Three Celestial Jade Towers. The Perfected Immortal of High Inspection, Gaoxian Weiling Guangji—later incarnation of Lingji—though venerated in the sacrificial canon, had no formal liturgical composition.

During the *Shaoxing* reign, the realm was divided into western, southern, and northern domains. In the sixth year, *jiachen*, the northern temple was grandly constructed, and the villagers, led by Lin □, recorded its history—ninety-eight years in all. Though the temple had nearly fallen into ruin, it was revived, and the names of its benefactors remain traceable. Counting the years, sixty-seven more have now passed.

In the third year of the *Dade* era, on the eighth day before the spring community sacrifice, Zeng Chen, Fu Long, and others, leading their fellow villagers, carried a single incense censer and hastened to perform rites in the eastern courtyard of the temple. They prayed to me, saying: "This temple has long been abandoned. We wish to restore it but have not yet received an auspicious divination and dare not proceed." I admonished them, saying: "It is auspicious." They then entreated me to compose an inscription for its stele, and I could not refuse.

The prayer reads:

In this era of imperial unity, the realm enjoys great peace. Daoist sanctuaries and Buddhist monasteries—all neglected things are now revived. The village establishes its altar, and the deity dwells in tranquility.

In the year of *Yuanxian*, the Dipper’s handle points to *yin*. The time for sacrifice arrives, and the rites are performed with utmost clarity. Yet the images are dim, their forms obscured. Tiles crumble, walls are defiled, and wind and rain batter them. Fearful and anxious, we seem to have failed in our duty. Thus, we consulted the people and divined by the gods. We cast yarrow and tortoiseshell, weighing the long and the short, the before and the after. Hesitant and uncertain, we placed our trust in me alone.

In obscurity, without sound or form, how dare I boast or deceive, misleading the ears of others? Yet I depend on this benevolent land—what more can I say?

The script turns from seal to clerical, from fish to bird. On the *yichou* day of the second month, an auspicious day and hour, earthworkers and carpenters set to their tasks. They trimmed flaws, filled cracks, restored the old, and enhanced the new. They adorned it with whitewash and painted it with cinnabar and azure. Assistants and attendants, above, correspond to the four stars. If the people act with virtue, they shall receive blessings and prosperity. The two steps bear the shields and plumes, guarding the village and its neighbors.

The six lords, adorned with pearls and jade, perform wondrous dances to the sound of reed pipes and songs. The *Yunmen* ninefold music resounds, and the *Fangzhang* eight delicacies are arrayed. A hundred entertainers, their forms lifelike and fierce, perform. Spectators fill the roads, their carriages lined side by side. Laughter and joy abound, their faces alight with happiness. The work is completed with ease, and I record it in writing.

My words are coarse and unrefined, like one clutching their chest in distress. Who am I? The Perfected Immortal Lingji. To the east of Longshou Temple, this record is inscribed on the stele.

Heaven deems him worthy and sage; my later incarnation bears the surname Pan. His given name is known through his blessings. A direct descendant of the *Chengyu* lineage, he first entered Min. Clad in the robes of office, he was once recommended as a filial and incorrupt candidate. The imperial commissioner, Marquis Liu, honored him with silk and a rush-wheeled carriage. Though repeatedly summoned, he declined, holding wealth and rank as floating clouds. He chose to dwell on Biefeng, carving fields from the earth. Upright and pure, he felt no shame in partaking of simple fare.

His immortal bones were extraordinary; he studied under *Wochuan*. From Dragon Peak, he received a scroll, emerging from the blue and entering the mysterious. West of the Gorge River, where flying waters seethe, he walked upon the void without wetting or drowning. The world was astonished, the age amazed—his deeds touched the unseen.

Weary of the clamor of the world, he made himself known through the Dao. "To hear the Way in the morning is to die content"—thus did he return to his true nature. One day, he transformed like a molting cicada. After the *Qiande* era, he appeared in dreams. Once his transgressions were purged, timely rains answered his prayers. The five grains flourished, bringing benefit to the people. The people, grateful and joyful, offered autumn sacrifices and winter provisions.

Before the temple’s establishment, sacrifices were held in the great courtyard. According to the old plaque, this began in the *Shaoxing* era. The temple was built with reverence, its reputation resplendent. In the first year of *Shaoding*, the hall was near collapse. Restoring its former grandeur required great effort. Only the worthy may approach sageliness, truly earning their illustrious title. The people exalt his virtue, and the authorities preserve it. If the divine is made manifest, listen with singular devotion.

From this day forth, the sage may be venerated as Heaven. As for me, Lingji, my deeds have fulfilled the three thousand. Possessing all, I match the Three Spirits. On the *wu* day, most auspicious, the offerings are pure with pepper and fragrance. "The people, too, are weary"—this truly accords with my heart.

Inscribed in stone, this record shall endure for a thousand ages. I rely on the restoration of wonders, for without people, there is no cause. I humbly hope for imperial enfeoffment, that eight characters may shine with glory. With hands clasped in reverence, I bow my head—may the Son of Heaven live ten thousand years!

**Record of the Temple of the Minister of Agriculture and the Community Corner Shrine**

Once, while attending the Heavenly Laba Festival, I lingered on my return. Suddenly, a guest appeared—girded with gold, robed in purple—standing beneath the hall. He cried out in a stern voice: "Alive, one is a man; dead, one becomes a ghost. To be a gentleman’s ghost is to never dare bring misfortune upon others. To be a petty man’s ghost is to lack efficacy."

"The western temple has its record; the southern and northern have their steles. I shall soon rot away like grass and wood." Hearing his words, I ordered my attendants to bring him forward. He was an upright deity, the god of the Community Corner Shrine.

I descended, took his hand, and led him up, saying: "Had you not spoken, I would have nearly lost you. Wearing stitched robes and a ceremonial cap, one finds it hard to journey to Yue. In this age, only the wicked and the richly powerful may establish themselves. Only those who calculate to the finest detail may secure their livelihood. Your duty is to open the land for agriculture."

"In spring one plows, in summer one weeds; in autumn one reaps, in winter one stores. Throughout the year, toil knows no rest, not a day of peace. The gates of Heaven lie ten thousand li away—who would be the one to plead for your distant cares and beg for mercy? Who is Changfang that he dare command and drive you? The magpie’s numinous power did not spare it from being painted to fill the river; the tortoise’s numinous power did not spare it from the agony of propping up a bed. Why does the cock not crow? Why does the dog not bark? Why does the ox pant? Why is the horse exhausted? How exacting is your reproach!

"Can one truly expect the private prayers of a pig’s trotter and a bowl of wine? Yet even so, the farmer does not cease to plow because of flood or drought. You oversee the duty of agriculture—how can you dwell in ease and delight in your office? Why must you angle for fame and fish for reputation, adopting the ways of the vulgar world?

"From this year onward, if the harvests are bountiful, then the sacrifices will be most luminous—how could it stop at a hundred generations? They shall endure as long as Heaven and Earth. In admiration of your ability, I inscribe the plaque: *Temple of the Controller of Agriculture and the Community Corner Shrine.*

"As for the temple’s origins, it was first moved here from Five Blessings Crag, and many years have passed since. The dates of its renovations are recorded on the beams, so I shall not belabor them here. Written in the year of *sheti ge*, on the second day after the Heavenly Laba Festival, by the Man of Turtle Peak Mountain.

*Record of the Temple of the Controller of Crops and the Dragon Mountain Elder*
The lord’s surname was Gong, his given name Chengzan, a remnant subject of Wang Rong of Futang. In the fourth year of Qianning of the Tang, he passed the *hongci* examination and rose to the highest ranks of office. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the realm was carved up by heroes and warlords."

Amidst national peril and political chaos, when moral winds had decayed and customs grown shallow, the lord abandoned his wife and children, left his ancestral tombs, concealed his brilliance, and refused to serve the times. He journeyed north to White Deer Mountain, traversing lofty peaks and perilous passes, until he chose to build his dwelling halfway up Turtle Peak, naming it Flag Dragon Mountain. There, the land lay level and expansive, with secluded waters and limpid streams, allowing him to fulfill his resolve.

The Min king, surnamed Wang, sent gifts of silk and treasure to summon him, yet he would not bend to serve. During the Yonglong era, when the Wang brothers turned against one another in internal strife, routed soldiers scattered like stars, fleeing eastward into the mountains and forests. Hearing of the lord’s lofty integrity, they passed by his gate without daring to enter.

In the Tianfu era of the Jin, when Tang forces marched south in punitive campaign, the elders of the village, fearing the chaos would turn to cruelty, begged the Tang army to exterminate them. The lord donned Tang robes and cap, and paid homage to the two kings—now the Divine Perfected of Numinous Aid. When the king reclaimed his throne and offered him a position in the幕府, the lord declined the salary. Instead, he carved fields from the mountainside, tilling and sowing himself. In years of abundance, when the grain was fine, he would provide for his neighbors who lacked enough in spring.

A humane man’s intent is carved in ten thousand mouths as a stele.

In the eighth year of Tianfu, one day, a shooting star suddenly fell beside his dwelling. The lord, knowing his allotted span complete, received the villagers’ joint veneration, his incense smoke ascending. He donated the fields he had tilled and sown to the communal mountain endowment, to be held in perpetuity for ancestral rites. Hoping the Divine Perfected of Numinous Aid would guard this land, he was granted a shared place at their table. Tasked with overseeing the harvest, he governed the rains and sunshine, tended the cattle and livestock. From beginning to end, he discharged his duties with diligence. As the years passed, the shrine halls fell into disrepair; the village elders pooled their strength to rebuild and renew them.

When winds and rains came in season, the five grains flourished, livestock multiplied, and the sounds of chickens and dogs filled the air—these were the blessings the elders received under his shelter, not for a single day alone. If fathers were kind and sons filial, elder brothers friendly and younger brothers respectful, husbands virtuous and wives chaste, who else could have brought about such harmony if not the lord? Was he not a disciple of Zheng Zizhen and Yan Junping?

O spirit of the lord, I have been asked to record this. I dare to set forth his life’s path, that later generations may know it.

On the *la* day of the twelfth month in the second year of Dade, recorded by the Old Man of Biefeng, Xu Zi.

**Record of the Hall of United Spring**

On the evening of the great autumnal purification rite in the year of *Yuanxiu*, a villager named So-and-so came bearing incense and prayed to me, saying: "For seventy or eighty years, my humble dwelling has been the dilapidated house of my ancestors. There was once a wooden plaque that read *Hall of Extended Blessings*, but it has long been buried in dust and neglect, its luster faded. I wished to renew it but could not. Now, admiring your resolve to honor such an ancestral intent and bring it to fruition, I have ordered my attendants to grind a thick ink of *Chuanmo* and fashion a brush from reeds. In one breath, I inscribed it—characters as large as a dou—reading *United Spring*.

What is *United Spring*? It is the spring that pervades all things between heaven and earth. The sluggish stir, the submerged rise, the hooked sprout, the armored split—all swell and fill, all grow and mature. Who brings this to pass? Do you understand the meaning of spring?"

I replied, "Yes."

Retiring to reflect in private, I found no answer. Returning with my robe gathered, I said, "Your servant is dull-witted. Pray, instruct me in these words."

"You ask what makes spring spring? There is heaven and earth. Man, born between them, is but one thing among many. If spring does not even know why it is spring, how can man comprehend it? Ah, how stubborn! Your words are confounding. Sit again, and I shall tell you.

The spring of heaven and earth *is* spring. The spring of man is this same spring. How could one seek spring outside of it? What is it, then? The spring of heaven and earth lies in its *qi*—warm and harmonious; in its nature—radiant and tender; in its *qi*—nurturing, sheltering, and protecting. This is why all things partake of spring. If the *qi* were scorching and harsh, that would be summer, not spring. If the nature were bleak and desolate, that would be autumn, not spring. If the intent were stern, urgent, and pressing, that would be winter, not spring. Without spring, what would become of things?

Man is no different. You must understand this. Father as father, son as son, husband as husband, wife as wife, elder brother as elder brother, younger brother as younger brother—these are the great human relations. They must first take root in filial piety, kindness, fraternal love, harmony, and humility. Only when the root is firm and deep will the spring wind stir and move them: their branches will grow long, their leaves flourish, their blossoms bloom, and their fruits ripen. Otherwise, though spring rains water them day after day, it will be of no avail.

Thus, the root of man must be tended with care—planted with effort, entrusted to diligent nurturing—so that one may hope for growth, like the young shoots of a sapling. Extend this understanding to unite your household as one, and this will be a spring without spring, a spring in harmony with heaven and earth. How could it not swell and fill, grow and mature?

Having received these words, I was suddenly enlightened. Clutching the text, I returned home and hastily took up a brush to write it down. I instructed my family to prepare a feast—one dish, one cup—setting the table in the *Hall of United Spring*. Young and old gathered in order, toasting and urging one another, drinking and pausing. As I hovered between drunkenness and sobriety, I called for a servant to bring water for rinsing, then read the text aloud, making a humming sound for my family to hear. Clapping my hands, I declared, 'Though not yet drunk, I am fortunate that nothing troubles me. My heart truly knows the spring of this day! From today to tomorrow, and tomorrow to the next day—no day without spring. From this year to the next, and the next to a thousand, ten thousand years—what year will lack spring? I have found this spring, and you, too, have found it. May we never shame the name of this hall.'

The feast ended, and my family clapped their hands, rising with great laughter."

*—Written by the Old Man of Biefeng.*

**Inscription for the Gate**

Words must be loyal and sincere,
Deeds must be earnest and respectful.
Rites must be solemn and reverent,
Demeanor must be upright and proper.
In conduct toward oneself and others,
Only harmony and prudence suffice.
Ears, eyes, heart, and thoughts—
I examine myself thrice daily.
Advancing knowledge and putting it into practice,
One may aspire to sagehood.
In affairs, emulate Yi and Zhou;
In virtue, follow Yan and Min.
Accumulate goodness to transmit to your family,
And blessings will surely overflow.
Inscribed upon this gate—
Let your descendants heed these words.

**Record of the Longevity and Heavenly Jade Cliff Daoist Sanctuary**

The Great Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha’s Heart, Qingcong, styled *Stone Path*, was surnamed Bi by birth. A native of Youyang in Putian, his family had long followed the Confucian tradition. In his youth, he studied at the prefectural academy of Sanshan, where those he associated with were all eminent and outstanding scholars. When the imperial tombs were relocated and the celestial bodies dimmed, he abandoned his secular pursuits and entered the gate of emptiness.

Initially, he received instruction under Master Heng Zhenwen of Dongshan and received the transmission from Master Guangzhi of Yuzhong. In character, the Master was inwardly luminous and outwardly harmonious, requiring no cultivation to refine himself. His mouth constantly recited Buddhist sutras, and as for Confucian texts, he never set them aside for a single day. Moreover, he was well-versed in the calligraphy of Zhong [You] and Wang [Xizhi], and at that time, his peers acclaimed him as the foremost among the Southern School’s White Eyebrows—who else but him?

From Putian, the Master entered Fuzhou and first took residence at Yingtian Temple in Min, where he spent sixteen years. He often told others, “Among the eighty-four thousand dharma gates, one must first practice expedient means oneself.” He wished to establish another sanctuary but could not find a suitable place. Not far from Yingtian Temple, in the land known as *Niumingdi*, stood the former residence of Councilor Tang, which had been reduced to rubble after the ravages of war. In the *renchen* year of the Zhiyuan era (1292), the heirs of that estate offered the land for sale to the Master. Privately rejoicing, he said, “My karmic affinity with the Dao is no mere coincidence.” Thereupon, he donated his remaining robes and savings to purchase the site and began construction in earnest.

One day, accompanied by his friend, Master Chonglin Daohuan, he carried a volume of texts and surveyed the land, discerning the mountain’s dragon veins with the eye of dharma. Twin peaks rose like hair buns, vying in splendor to the north and south. North of the twin peaks, a path led eastward. The needle pointed to *qian* (northwest), then branched into two arms—one forming a stone arrangement resembling the character *pin* (品), its three faces jagged yet upright. Perhaps heaven and earth had nurtured this numinous formation, awaiting its destined purpose.

During the Yongjia era of the Jin, a recluse surnamed Yu crossed the river and built his hut here. Inspired by the *pin*-shaped stones, he styled himself *Master of the Jade Pin Mountain*, and thus the mountain came to be called *Jade Pin*. *Jade Pin Mountain* was the mountain’s general name. From its summit, a vein emerged from the *pin* formation, winding like a wasp’s waist or a horse’s jaw. Midway, it branched into three peaks, towering and steadfast, their rounded summits firmly planted—these were named *Hanqi* (Shaking Marvel). Proceeding further, the path shifted with each step, its turns resembling oar strokes, and was called *Lianhua* (Lotus Flower). At its terminus, three ridges pressed into the earth, majestic and precipitous, forming the shape of an immortal’s grand seat.

To the east lay the *Eight Turtles Hall* and *Sizhou Bridge*; to the west, the *Qilin Grotto* and *Zhenwu Crag*. Above the *Mingtang* (Bright Hall) stood mountains named *Huxie* (Gourd Arbor), *Wushi Gang* (Crow Stone Ridge), and *Ancient Pine*. Around the mountain, twin emerald streams meandered in serpentine coils, their every inch spanning a thousand *li*, stretching endlessly into the distance. An outlying peak, *Fangshan* (Square Mountain), rose externally, while internally, *Tianzhu* (Heavenly Pillar) was erected as its support. Below *Tianzhu* lay Yingtian Temple. Two peaks leapt backward, enclosing the water’s tail like a gate, resembling oxen and horses drinking from the stream—playful and full of charm.

South of the twin peaks, the path led to *Dazuo Feng* (Grand Seat Peak), *Yuyao Feng* (Jade Medicine Peak), and *Shuangtong Feng* (Twin Youths Peak). Below *Shuangtong* lay *Baotai Feng* (Treasure Terrace Peak), *Qiyun Feng* (Rising Cloud Peak), *Jinlan Feng* (Golden Rail Peak), *Sanlang Feng* (Third Son Peak), and *Chaoyang Feng* (Facing Sun Peak). These peaks stood in imposing array, their spires clashing like antlers. Beyond them, the horizon stretched unbroken in all four directions.

When Master Yun of Zhishan’s *Bieshan* (Separate Mountain) Lodge visited, he composed a *gatha* on the *Ten Marvelous Peaks* to express his sentiments. All who climbed and explored the site could not help but praise it. Having acquired the land, the Master set about construction in grand fashion, orienting the sanctuary to face southeast with its back to the northwest. Pointing to the extraordinary site, he exclaimed, “Who has led me to delight in this land and take the initiative? Is this not the karmic affinity of a sanctuary?”

The Master’s conduct and practices astonished all who heard or saw him. Though he wished to conceal himself and leave no trace, he found that even in the absence of traces, concealment was impossible. The leading figures of various schools, unwilling to let him go, invited him to Dongyue Mountain Temple and presented him with hundreds of sheets of calligraphy. Dongyue Temple lay north of Fuzhou’s administrative seat, adjacent to the clamor of markets and dust. Those of shallow learning and limited vision who dwelled there were inevitably bound by attachments. Yet the Master’s nature was unadorned and free, devoid of form, thought, knowledge, or attainment. Only the thought of establishing a sanctuary never ceased; he longed to fulfill this aspiration but could not bear the burden alone.

In the *yiwei* year (1315), he entrusted his disciples, led by Master Long, to oversee the project. Construction began on a certain day, month, and *jiazi* cycle, with rituals performed and ground broken. Walls were raised and huts built atop the site, and the sanctuary was named *Shoutian Yuyan Daochang* (Longevity and Heavenly Jade Cliff Daoist Sanctuary). *Shoutian* (Longevity Heaven) shared the same lineage as *Yingtian* (Responding Heaven), while *Yuyan* (Jade Cliff) was derived from the name *Jade Pin Mountain*.

At its center stood a hall named *Yingji* (Responding to Opportunity). Behind the hall was the *Guanyin Hall*, and behind that, two chambers were built to honor his masters—one named *Dongshan Shouyu* (Longevity Domain of Dongshan), the other *Yuzhong Guizang* (Returning to Repose of Yuzhong). The Master did not claim this sanctuary for himself but dedicated it to his two teachers, thereby demonstrating his unwavering devotion to his lineage.

Beneath the hall, earth was excavated to form a pond, broad at the edges and deep at the center. Springs were channeled to fill it, its waters neither increasing nor decreasing. Nine grades of lotus flowers bloomed there, their varieties distinct yet sharing the same fragrance. When the nine merged into one, their wonder defied description—was this not the essence of *Jade Pin*? The mountain’s veins originated from three stones above, three peaks in the middle, and three branches below, totaling nine—hence the division into nine grades, a numerological significance drawn from this.

The lotus pond derived its name from the mountain’s *Lianhua* (Lotus Flower) peak. Moreover, the Master’s lineage traced back to *Tianchi* (Heavenly Pool), and thus he named the pond after those two characters. The mountain’s orientation aligned with *qian* (northwest) and *hai* (north), corresponding to the names of heaven and earth—truly a harmonious resonance.

Beside the pond stood a pavilion, and the pavilion’s structure included a terrace. Flowers and trees were planted, their fragrance perfuming the four seasons. This was a sight to inspire admiration in all who visited—how could one not delight in such a place?

As for the three hundred *mu* of land set aside for vegetarian offerings, they provided resources for incense and lamps, fulfilling the Golden Immortal’s teaching of the *unfailing mind*.

Expanding upon this was Yu Zhong of Dongshan. Furthermore, at the foot of Chaoyang Mountain, he established a burial mound as a cavern for dwelling in truth—was this not also in accord with the Golden Immortal’s teaching of the Dharma of quiescent extinction? Was the Master not a disciple of the Golden Immortal?

In the third year of the Dade era, in the ji-hai year, six days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Master sent Dao Huan to present me with a map of the land and request a record, saying: “The construction of the hermitage is nearly complete. I have also purchased the neighboring land, acquiring the foundations of former worthies. Though it is now an overgrown wasteland, this too is the legacy of Tang Chengyi. I have already begun clearing and cultivating it, estimating labor and materials to build a great Buddha hall, modeled after the finest monastic halls, to pray for the eternal peace of our present emperor. Thus may the faithful of the countryside find a place of refuge. Beyond this, there will be three gates, two cloisters, a Dharma hall, living quarters, infirmaries, granaries, and storehouses—each with space reserved for future expansion. Plans are made to proceed step by step, though I know not when the work will be fully accomplished.”

Alas! The Master’s words seem fitting indeed. With such vision, such aspirations, and such capacity, how could his endeavor not succeed? The only fear is that the Master might not act. I, Hong Nian, unworthy and unknown, dare to bow in respect to the Master and raise the verse of the Venerable Master Zhao Xian:

*At the hundred-foot pole’s tip, one must take another step—*
*The ten directions’ world is the whole of one’s body.*

Hearing this verse, the Master could not help but laugh aloud and say: “So it is, so it is! I shall accomplish it.” When it is accomplished, might you then write a continuation of this record for me? I replied: “I dare not refuse.”

I, who am I? A son of the Xu family of Guangling, my name and style lost to time, my origins recorded in the *Genealogies of the Five Dynasties* under the Qi lineage. I call myself the Hermit of Biefeng Mountain. Here I gather these matters and set them down in record. The Master had the words carved upon stone, leaving them to show to later generations.

*Continuation of the Inscription for the Shoutian Yuyan Daoist Sanctuary*

The meaning of the character "Buddha" is explained as "not-human." Being "not-human," it has no roof above, no shelter below, no walls in the ten directions, no gates on four sides. Taking the three-thousandfold great-thousandfold world as its vastness—who knows what transient combination this is?

The *Diamond Sutra* says: "It is not adornment; this is called adornment." This is why it is called Buddha, for the Buddha-mind shines universally.

The transmission of the Sixth Patriarch’s robe and bowl followed in due order. First, he received the teaching from Zhen of Dongshan, residing at Yingtian Temple. Then, the seal was passed to Zhigong of Yuzhong, who dwelled at Yueshan Temple. The morning bell and evening drum were enough to bring ease and contentment.

Yet on Yupin Mountain, he built a hermitage called the Shoutian Yuyan Daoist Sanctuary. Was this merely for hauling firewood and carrying water, or to display supernatural powers? Every beam and tile, every timber and stone, were all personally handled by the Master. I say his effort was both laborious and clumsy.

When the hermitage was completed, he asked me to record its history. To record is one thing; to add words of praise is another. Yet I could not escape the worldly habit. The Master’s mind, like Han’s horses or Xue’s cranes, was already complete in itself.

The structures included: one grand hall as the largest; two halls for the Dharma and for repose; three for the spirit assembly. There were gates and corridors, long verandas and side halls. There were granaries, storehouses, kitchens, and monastic cells. The abbot’s quarters stood square and solid, resplendent in their completeness—nine out of ten things were in place.

The earthworkers, carpenters, and stonemasons were nearly finished—seven or eight out of ten tasks done. Counting backward, it had taken four, five, or six years to complete. One can imagine the grandeur of its construction.

I say the Master’s effort was still laborious and clumsy. When he commanded me to continue the record, I feared I might fail to capture the true intent behind it. Have you not seen Master Cen? He said, "This is a man of the present age—he must hide himself away." Can you fathom this?

The Master sat in silent meditation. In an instant, he raised a staff and shouted: "Though the hermitage is small, it contains the Dharma-realm. Open it wide—nothing is beyond its vastness. Draw it in—nothing is within its smallness."

Such words are no Dharma-case of Bodhidharma—do you grasp them?

In my eyes and ears, the sound alone pierced through. Thus I knew that the Master’s construction of this Dao-chamber was no different in scale from the Jetavana Monastery built by the Buddha. Was the Master’s purpose in erecting this Dao-chamber truly here? If not here, then it resided solely within the square inch of the heart.

Its framework defies measurement by foot or yard. Its orientation eludes the compass’s needle. Its realm transcends the wild vastness of unhewn stone. Its artistry surpasses the towering steepness of the Ten Peaks, its depth beyond the abyss of the Twin Streams—no source can be fathomed. How fine, how excellent—all virtues □□.

If one can comprehend this, one sees that the entire earth is a monastic ground. One eye opened wide, the other roams freely. Eastward, no bounds; westward, no limits; upward, it props up the heavens; downward, it props up the earth—unobstructed in all four directions, eight reaches. Its radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the ten directions, like a thousand suns casting boundless light. Otherwise, how could it be called *The Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha-Mind*?

The Dao-chamber is built—how could it be easy? To record this is to inscribe its intent. I dare not overstep the Master’s gate. Borrowing Mount Sumeru as a peak, the ocean’s waters as ink, and a great slab of stone from Lion Rock, I inscribe and erect this stele, so that for a hundred million kalpas to come, unbroken and indestructible, it may proclaim the purpose behind *The Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha-Mind* and the *Record of the Jade Crag Dao-Chamber of Longevity and Heaven*.

The hermitage’s history has been recorded before; thus, I compose this eulogy:

Master Cong, styled Stone Path,
Hailing from Putian, bearing his surname to the end.
A scholar by family tradition, clad in noble robes—
Yet hills and valleys shift, literary stars fade.
The world’s tides surge, but he did not contend.
Unadorned and pure, such was his true nature.
His studies refined, he turned to the Western Sage.
In a single moment of insight, not through mirrors or towers,
He traced the source’s flow, a lineage of endurance.
The Eastern Mountain’s revival—he received the touch of ordination.
From fool to sage, he transmitted the true seal.
First serving in the capital, praised for his talent,
Now in Yue’s mountains, leading the multitudes.
He founded the Dao-chamber, divining Jade Crag.
Dragons received the Dharma, the lineage unified.
The dense forest gleams, the canon corrected.
Qi congeals, stone □□.
Twin streams flow, ten peaks arrayed.
Facing southeast, peerless in splendor.
Excavating earth, clearing obstructions,
Molding bricks, hewing beams steady.
Raising walls, planting screens,
The hermitage complete, Chan calm and still.
Its name fitting its purpose, inscribed upon the hall.
Exotic lotuses bloom in the pond’s long furrows.
Pavilions stand like tripods among flowers and trees.
Two masters’ shrines, revered with devotion.
The living thrive, the departed rejoice.
Year after year, offerings made—this record was my request.
Neighbors settled, labor and land combined.
Earth, wood, stone—craftsmanship ever vigorous.
One hall, open and expansive.
Three chambers, where Dharma-clouds repose.
Corridors stretch, long and straight.
Joints precise, doors aligned.
Granaries filled, kitchens pristine.
Quarters and rooms, all in perfect order.
Fields of two or three *qing*,
One stupa mound—all affairs settled.
Disciples Long and others, following the Master’s command,
Five or six years—work at last complete.
Open one eye, observe closely:
The Master’s dwelling—realm or no-realm?
Within the square inch of the heart, traces of labor vanish.
A single point of light, ever bright,
Permeating the Dharma-realm, towering ten thousand *ren*.
The Buddha came from the West—what cultivation, what realization?
Water in the vase, stars on the scale.
Silent, then speaking—suddenly, self-awareness.
What is the meaning? Pure faith arises.
Robes may spread wide, draped over Mount Dayu’s ridge.
Continuing the lamp’s lineage, the flame never extinguished.
Mind is Buddha—no comparison suffices.
Called *Universal Illumination*, the two resonate.
The Master’s subtlety—let all listen closely.
This record’s intent—my dullness persists.
The eulogy lacks polish, shameful in its crudeness.
This stele carved, its years endure.

*Record of the Western Grove Monastery*

In the old customs of Fuzhou’s city in Min, local records speak of the "Three Mountains." According to Guo Pu’s *Relocation of the State’s Land Records*: "Before it lie the twin brows of a youth, adorned with powder and rouge." This refers to Wushi Mountain, Jiuxian Mountain, and Fang Mountain to the north. There are also Gaogai Mountain and Lianhua Mountain, corresponding to Fang Mountain. The name "Three Mountains" originates here.

Among the Three Mountains, Fang Mountain stands most prominently. South of the prefectural seat, it appears like a table—heaven’s craftsmanship, earth’s creation. How could it be merely for the prefecture’s sake?

I have often said that among mountains of numinous wonder, there must emerge people of extraordinary talent, virtue, loyalty, and integrity to match them—yet I had never witnessed it. One day, wandering at the foot of Fang Mountain, after a *li*’s journey, I came upon a Buddhist monastery, coiled and towering, its plaque reading *Western Grove Chan Monastery*. The Dharma-gate vast, halls deep and grand, corridors stretching like wings, pavilions soaring like channels.

To the east, the *Heavenly Meal Fragrant Accumulation Kitchen*; to the west, the *Cloud Assembly Chan Banquet Hall*. As for the *Arhat Shrine*, *Jeweled Flower Hall*, and *Abbot’s Quarters*—none lacked splendor. Granaries and storied chambers left no space unfilled. Timber, stone, rafters, tiles—whitewashed walls all renewed. Bells, fish-shaped wooden drums—every implement in place.

As for the pond’s excavation, water channeled to cultivate pure minds—unstained, unsoiled, this is called adornment. The azure lotus, the golden Buddha—rays of white light illuminate the ten directions, pervading the three thousand great thousand worlds.

I burned incense, pressed palms together—like ascending to heaven. The four great elements, the five aggregates—truly, nothing exists. I sighed: this is how those who transcend the world achieve merit and renown.

After a moment, the abbot emerged, draped in his robe, sleeves holding his sitting mat, and greeted me.

I beheld the man—his bearing open and forthright, free of self-and-other distinctions. Bowing, I asked: “Master, were you the founder of this mountain temple?” He invited me to sit, brewed tea in welcome, and spoke unhurriedly: “The temple’s founding master was the patriarch of the Tang’s Guangming era. A century later, Chan Master Jingde of the Song expanded it into a proper sanctuary. Counting the years to now, more than three hundred springs and autumns have passed. In the Xianchun year of *wuchen*, this old monk came from Longjiang and dwelt on the mountain for a full decade. Just then, war broke out, reducing all to ruins and overgrown wilderness—passersby could only sigh. Without consulting others or seeking aid, I emptied my own robes and alms-bowl, single-handedly shouldering the task. Hoarding what little surplus I had, treating it as personal wealth, I hired laborers and artisans upon the old site. Through years of toil and service, I at last achieved this restoration. I added fields to the holdings, bringing greater benefit than before, merely to sustain the morning incense and evening lamps for the assembly. Above, I pray for the sovereign’s longevity; below, I offer the villagers a refuge within the Buddha’s Dharma. Thus may I face without shame the two founding masters, Guangming and Jingde.

Within the abbot’s quarters, I built a hall and erected a pagoda, arraying the ocean-wide assembly of past generations to left and right. Above, I sculpted the Three Buddhas; below, I designated a single niche as the *spirit chamber*, where the true returns to its source—this fulfills this old monk’s vow. Now I wish to quarry mountain stone and inscribe the years, that future eyes may know the origins of this place. Having long heard of your true goodness, I wished to learn of the causes and conditions of the *Empty School’s* teachings—how fitting! With Mount Sumeru as my brush and the sea as ink, I could compose but a few lines, no different from speech. As you offer skillful means, I dare not refuse.”

Thus I replied: “Excellent! Excellent! The master’s name is Zheng Rong. His ancestors hailed from the old county of Changle, bearing the surname Xie. Though his family had long been scholars, he was one of those rare, loyal, and virtuous men who could forsake the world and yet attain merit and renown.”

Having recorded this, I let out a long whistle and stepped outside—no one knew where I had gone. The master said: “How spirit-like!”

On the day preceding the Chrysanthemum Festival of the first year of the Yuanzhen era, this was recorded by Xu Ruzi, former Prefect of Guangling, of Donghai.

*Volume Three of Xu’s Immortal Brush begins*

**Ode to Turtle Peak**

How towering! How lofty!—the soaring majesty of Turtle Peak!
According to the *Diagrams of Symbols* in the *Huainanzi*, we know its ancestral roots lie in Kunlun;
Examining the *Green Satchel Classic* of Master Red Pine, we know its branches spread from Mount Yuling.

From the south it comes, as if the myriad foreign lands had converged, turning northward to pay homage.
It emulates the reverence of Mount Song in offering blessings to the sacred—its bearing refined, its form upright.
Like an overturned golden bowl, like a vast cauldron upturned.
Like an immortal donning ceremonial robes, like a jade maiden unveiling her mirror.
Like a warrior’s helmeted reflection, like a nobleman’s scepter held in hand.

Before it, Square Mountain bows as its footrest;
Behind it, Mount Pu stands as its screen.
Deer Mountain flanks it to the left, while Zhihe Mountain supports it to the right.
All stand in perfect order—tall, erect, and steadfast.
Even the Nine Flowers of Chi or the Yellow Mountains of She could not compare to this peak’s grandeur;
The peaks of Chengdu or the cliffs of Yandang could not rival its fame.
The mountains of Kuaiji in Wu, the marshes of Yunmeng in Chu, Luofu in Hui, or Wuling in Lang—none could capture its form, nor dare describe it.

I measure it with my tablet held horizontally—its expanse spans no less than two or three hundred *li*.
I gauge its height with a marker—it rises no less than four or five thousand *zhang*.
A mere hand’s breadth from heaven, it looms before the gazer’s eyes.
Climbing with a flask at one’s waist and a rope in hand, one ascends directly.
Each step brings one closer to the Purple Tenuity’s court; with a raised hand, one might scoop the waves of the Silver River.
How small are men and things! The vast earth lies before my eyes, as if displayed on my palm.

Had General Meng lived here, he would surely have feared his cap falling;
Had Governor Xie known of it, he would have longed to lace his sandals.
Yet those men are gone—who now appreciates this sight?

As for its undulating forms—high and low, convex and concave, uneven yet ordered—layer upon layer, like fields and ridges.
At dawn, the mist recedes, and the sun’s crow rises in the east;
At dusk, the rosy clouds scatter, and the white hare’s moon appears in the west.
It draws in the pure radiance—how bright!
It gathers the lush shadows—how verdant!

When spring winds stir, flowers and herbs bloom in fragrance;
When summer clouds gather, the forests cast deep shade.
When autumn dew dries, the mountain mists fade;
When winter frost falls, the grasses and trees wither.
Such are the rare moments of beauty, the scenes poets and scholars gaze upon in admiration.

Here, tigers and wolves, foxes and hares dwell in dens and burrows;
Birds and pheasants nest in roosts and bowers.
Some cry, some clamor, some howl, some roar.
The hunter casts his sky-spanning net, laying traps across the wilds.
With a summer bow in his right hand and a black-elk arrow in his left,
He captures or releases, steams or roasts—offering for my rites, filling my kitchen.

Its trees include pine, cypress, camphor, ju, chinaberry, paulownia, nanmu, *ning*, maple, fir, *luo*, beech, sandalwood, locust, catalpa, *ke*, *cha*, banyan, *□*, *zheng*, *cong*, *zhen*, wolfberry, *guang*, *□*, *si*, *□*—
The small may be used for shop signs, wedges, door pivots, or gates;
The large may serve as beams, rafters, ridgepoles, or eaves—so vast their uses, one may choose as needed.

There are also red plantains, white ramie, fine kudzu, green hemp, wild mulberry, wild silkworm oak, pagoda tree blossoms, indigo, *di* seeds, *nou* bark, true red, purple *□*—all to adorn the body.
Lychee, longan, *lü* oranges, pomelos, crabapples, yellow bullets, red cherries, white crabapples, *jia* loquats, *lu* cherries, bayberries, and black *bei*—all to delight the palate.

As for its herbs: elsholtzia, achyranthes, Solomon’s seal, yams, *jiaoteng*, *mawu*, rehmannia, *guzi*, mint, wormwood, perilla, nutgrass, evodia, chrysanthemum, hyacinth beans, vetiver, bitter *lou*, fennel, mugwort, *sui* *□*, phellodendron, *mubie*, poppy, goat’s milk—
Some grow as purple bamboo shoots of Guzhu, others as Job’s tears of Jiaozhou—nothing is lacking, though I cannot record them all.

How different from the past! I sigh that the months and years have fled.
Thus, with a single note of the flute, I join the cowherds in returning home.

Amidst the decayed chessboard of the *Burnt Axe*, one may learn from the woodcutter to steal a moment’s leisure. Where rocks stand jagged, they form the chambers of Daoist adepts; where grasses grow thick and wild, they become the hermit’s thatched hut. Here is a seat for meditation, there a terrace for ascending transcendence. Once the auspicious glow of heavenly lanterns appeared; once the alchemical cinnabar of the immortal’s crucible lingered. The echoes of stone drums still resound, the scars of sword-stones remain etched. Narrow and perilous paths are called the *Gates of Drawn Battle*; broad and level expanses serve as *Bays for Resting Horses*. These are not empty words—how could I speak falsely of ancient traces? Yet why this sigh of emotion? Surely they are still there to behold.

Lofty, lofty—cliffs too sheer to scale. Deep, deep—pools without bottom. Each stands in its depth or shallowness, dividing into two or three. Orchids and angelicas share fragrance, rich and dense; wisteria and creepers intertwine in emerald tangle. Springs gush forth in ceaseless flow, their murmuring currents soft and clear. A single waterfall hangs from cliffs ten thousand feet high—white as silk, blue as indigo. When it scatters, its droplets are round as pearls; when it surges, its depths are vast as a basin. No golden blade could so easily cut it, no jade ruler could truly measure it.

At times, a divine dragon transforms—now dim, now bright. It soars, it dives; it emerges, it vanishes. Now it lashes forth as thunder and lightning, now it rears as *□* and *□*. Now rain pours down in torrents, now clouds rise in gentle swells. Its shrine is grandly enfeoffed, and the people never grow weary of reverence.

When chaos first parted and the earliest ages began, who shaped this place? Adorning the earth with beauty, it lay beyond the Qin capital, outside the Han maps. Ruling over Nanyue, only King Wuzhu resisted the topknots and barbaric customs. Guarding this corner of the world, he concealed his light and hid his tracks—who dared praise him, who dared blame?

From the *Zhenguan* era of Tang, it was named an *Upper Capital*. Its reputation was grand, its bearing majestic. Like a slope rising abruptly amid miles of plain, it gathers verdant hues and spreads like a market, embracing the tidal roar like a basin. Its mound is called *Passing the Rammed Earth*; its ridge is named *Incense Burner*. Behold the whiteness of its waters, the blackness of its stones. The front ocean serves as its elbow and armpit; the rich mountains as its toes and instep. Here, upon this land, these people till their fields and build their homes.

Yet how the hills have shifted and valleys changed, how times alter and affairs diverge! In the Five Dynasties’ chaos, ten clans drove forward together. Who could have foreseen the Wang family, calling themselves the humble and foolish? Within, they drowned in excess; without, they imposed heavy levies. Palaces knew no bounds; hunting and pleasure were their sole delight. No fixed seasons, no rest from toil. Birds took flight in alarm, beasts fled in terror—life nearly ceased. Mountains were left barren, forests stripped—all turned to desolate mounds.

Was it not the Su clan’s repeated rise that withered the Eyebrow Mountain? As the saying goes, the matter is no lie. From *Jianlong* to *Xiangfu*, the court’s civil rule flourished; village schools and classical learning thrived. In time, great scholars and renowned officials emerged, aiding and promoting one another without hesitation. This place led all prefectures, breaking through the path to office. Crimson and purple adorned their backs; carriages and horses filled their gates.

Once, this peak’s numen shone through the excellence of things. Now, this peak’s essence resides in the store of men. Alas! North and south, east and west—time flows like the shuttle, yet this peak does not age. Entrusted with divinity, it was granted noble rank. Its honors increased, its wisdom never faltered, guiding people toward goodness. Though the literary spirit has not perished, the Dao hides in secrecy, subtle and obscure. I know my account may seem strange, fearing it borders on the dubious. I feel great shame before Cao Zhi’s grand principles, deep regret before Zuo Si’s decade of toil. Let this be my *Capture of the Unicorn* brush—lest it invite the scorn of being fit only to cover a wine jar.

*Ode to the Lingji Palace*

Dragons carve tortoises, turtles peddle books—how strange and uncanny! In the *Taiyuan* era of the *Jiao* dynasty, silence was not the way; I sought answers in the earliest images. Fu Xi and Nü Wa questioned the cause, yet remained dim and unenlightened. Only when the dark crow’s revelation came did they suddenly create and return to it. In profound obscurity, the craft of Chui aligned the compass—patterns emerged, intent was set. This was no mere omen from banquet mats or wine vessels; that numinous breath remained unknowable.

I observe the reclusive one, faint and indistinct, guarding the profound mystery in silence. Lightning flashes and vanishes in an instant—how fleeting! To fathom the universe is to reach its limits—who can foresee its end? Like the earth itself, it stretches without bound. Thus the Five Emperors stand tall, the Three Sovereigns unfold in succession. Divine parks have their regulations, sacred halls their standards. Treading the present with measured steps, who now strays or falters?

The nine heavens stretch vast and distant—where to place, where to attach? Why descend so sharply to dwell upon Bie Peak? Ascending winding paths to the splendid altar, I arrive at dawn’s first light. Heaven gazes down from azure heights; earth is piled into hills and mountains. Clouds twist and waves writhe—its foundations coil and twist, beginning in Dongping. Tracing back to the Tang’s sudden *□*, its roots split the tripod to form peaks. Towering, like a docile camel’s team; lofty, like a crimson steed and azure dragon.

Beholding the winding streams of lotus blossoms, I draw in pure numen and feel my heart refreshed. The sacred mountain’s *□* stands majestic, draped in lush, verdant qi. The nine wards and nine paths spread in disarray, like wells and houses linked in rows. Morning tides, evening ebbs—Dao flows vast and surging. Truly, mountains and rivers, earth spirits and ghosts, the Queen Mother nurtures the numinous.

In the *Zhenghe* era, officials were consulted to build it. Its solemn uprightness was grand; earth, wood, and stonework stood firm. Yet the columns of whetstone gleam, the carved jade pillars rise sheer. Flying eaves soar, tiered roofs ascend. Layered beams and interlocking brackets spread like wings, rich and intricate. Double rafters and stacked arches rise ever higher, tier upon tier.

The vermilion gates of layered pavilions unfold grandly, their grandeur rivaling the stone drums of Qiyang. The low walls and embankments stand in splendid ruggedness, resplendent in red and blue. Secret chambers and secluded halls loom jagged and deep, stretching into the boundless haze. The eastern corridors and western wings rise in towering succession, embracing the land’s contours in mutual embrace.

Here too are screens of kingfisher feathers and pearls, silken nets of peacock plumes in ordered ranks, and golden geese unfurled. Embroidered hems are stitched, woven mats spread beneath. They receive the sacred talismans of Mount Gou, moved by the golden vines of Manlu. Yet these are not enough to evoke antiquity—interspersed with glistening glass, they weave a tapestry of splendor.

Vermilion lingzhi clouds surge in swirling mists; auspicious incense from Boshan censers billows thick and fragrant. The wind sings through jade-railed cedar and pine; the moon hangs upon the patterned windows of locust and cassia. Some enclose earth to pool springs, their murmuring waters alive with rippling currents. Carp and mandarin fish dart through clear eddies, their tails flashing. The passage of accumulated blessings opens vast, gathering the great thousand worlds into a single grain.

The Dragon’s Head Peak soars to towering heights, its lofty summits circling the numinous pagoda. Outer structures link in endless succession, front and rear merging seamlessly. Forms vary, sights diverge—none can be fully described. Even the steps ascend in graded ranks; the guards’ formations follow strict commands. To the left, voices hush; to the right, silence reigns. The demons and specters stand firm, their shoulders laden with shields and spears. Harshly they bar the way, permitting no breath of disobedience. The reckless halt, hands bound, awaiting orders.

On the eve of rituals, vigil is kept with utmost care. Heads lift and bow in measured rhythm, advancing and retreating in turn. Faces are composed, expressions solemn. Eyes hold sincerity; reverence is etched in every gesture. The painted figures bristle with ferocity, their fiery auras blazing fiercely—these are the stalwart warriors. Vigilant and imposing, they stand like jade-clad soldiers. Tiger-headed, swallow-chinned, their strategies drawn from dragon’s arts and leopard’s cunning. Bows and arrows arrayed, banners and pennants raised, they wield halberds and brandish axes. Their movements leave no trace, their schemes hidden in the unfathomable. Like the ramparts of a willow camp, they display the order of a well-guarded encampment.

Thus they sever ties with factions, distance themselves from distant lands. From remote peaks and across the seas, tribute flows in ceaseless streams. Behold this hall—here guests and envoys find respite. Let it be recorded as a royal assembly, celebrating the Great Peace of this day.

With reverence, we extol the Emperor: may his reign span ten thousand years, a father and mother to all. Under heaven, all is the sovereign’s domain. He refines culture and stills warfare. Loyalty is his armor, trust his helmet; ritual his shield, righteousness his bulwark. He gathers poets in literary societies, hunts for talent in the forests of words. He roams the ink fields, dispatches envoys to the realm of brush and silk, drawing the multitudes to lofty brilliance. He summons auspicious clouds, □ the white elders. The Eastern Wall shines radiant, a dazzling spectacle to behold.

How grand! The Lingyan Pavilion, where the finest figures gather, all girded in gold and robed in purple. Like the Western Liang’s lion-dancing Hu, or the acrobats of Xunzhuang, they perform with dazzling agility. Veils swirl, movements blur—mastering the arcane arts of Zanggan, the melodies of the Pear Garden rise in resonant song. Here are the beauties of Chu, the charms of Wu, the maidens of Qin, the sisters of Wei. Powdered faces, dark brows, adorned in silks and brocades, adorned with gold and pearls. They feast on fine delicacies, sated with meat from the imperial cauldrons. Eight treasures flow in abundance, apportioned from the imperial kitchens. The assembled concubines vie in splendor—what path of indulgence is beyond reach? Yet the Emperor’s heart remains discerning, allowing no slack in skill, no laxity in pleasure for the eyes and ears.

The gates of heaven stand wide, unbarred, with no steps to ascend. The glory of his name and virtue rivals the sun and moon. Even a weight of ten thousand jun would not suffice to measure his worth. Yet how does he govern with effortless ease, ever vigilant as if in fear? He cherishes kin and fosters harmony, reciting the verses of *Famu*. The Lord of Lu feasts in joy, offering the hymns of the *Biyong*. The Hall of Names bears woven characters as its rule. Subtly it conveys its meaning, perhaps nearly enough to warn the multitude of cares.

The *Yu* dynasty’s omens of loss and gain were once divined—let them serve as a lesson. The literary legacy remains unlost, like Yan and Kong of old. The calligraphy of Huiping and seal scripts of Zhuanxu may be inscribed on the halls of the Xuanyuan. Breathing like bears, still as turtles—observing their techniques, even the later masters Huang, Ren, Xu, and Dong pale in comparison. Who among men could rival this? Only he may be proclaimed and enfeoffed, receiving heaven’s favor.

Again, the thunder gods are summoned to clear the path with rumbling cries; the rain masters are commanded to wash away the dust. Feilian drives the winds with fierce shouts. Their voices ring out, the Divine Mother hurls her might. The great procession begins, chariots drawn by dragons. Cloud banners flutter, eight simurghs and five phoenixes swirl in abundance. They converge in welcome, ascending on pure qi. The journey presses on, passing through the gates of heaven to reach the Purple Court. There is no pause in coming or going—below, inverted reflections; above, radiant light. A hundred flavors, fine wines offered with fragrant orchids. Though the halls of Du Heng stand serene, how can peace be assured forever? May your sacrifices endure for ten thousand ages.

*Wenxing Hermitage Rhapsody*
One day, a gentleman of refined tastes approached me, incense in sleeve, and said: "In our homeland, palaces and temples each have their steles, and the Hall of Accumulated Blessings has its record. The pagoda of Wenxing Hermitage, as a Daoist sanctuary, cannot be dismissed as insignificant—why not compose a few words for it?"

I do not dare to lag behind, but as the sanctuary nears ruin, no one has yet emerged to restore it to its former state. Thus, I feel shame. Now, prompted by your inquiry, I gather these details to encourage those with affinity.

Thus, I compose this rhapsody:

Turtle Peak rises ten thousand fathoms high, a mere grasp from heaven. Winding its way here, who knows how many rises and falls it has known? Suddenly, it unfurls into three verdant peaks—here stand your hut, your home. Bowing to the encircling ridges in homage, it gazes west and lingers in hesitation.

No donkey’s hooves could tread this ground—only the dragon and elephant make their dens here. Enshrined within is the Tathāgata’s true relic, each granule gleaming like golden peaches inlaid with jade. Wrapped in felt, bundled in mats, borne by camel from the Western Regions, it was set as the pagoda’s heart. Hewn from the mountain’s stone with water-polished edges, its seven-tiered bones ascend in towering splendor.

A thousand Buddhas manifest in its form, carved with wind-driven chisels and divine precision. A sacred flame burns cold and blue, illuminating the Dipper and Ox stars above. Beheld by humans, devas, ghosts, and spirits, all rejoice in my resolve—though some may fear its fulfillment. Morning and evening, devotees bow in reverence, their devotion deepening at the dark of the moon, its waxing, its waning, and its return.

This was the former abbot’s hermitage, where the monk Xiū composed his gāthās. A descendant of Bi Gan named Huaixian, he was the village’s pillar of generosity. With the wooden fish’s startling knock, his voice echoed through the night like a mountain crane’s call. His merit perfected in the Hall of Many Fragrances—one bowl, one spoon.

The stele inscription from the Yuánfú era still marks the years, though words cannot fully capture its tale. Here, I merely sketch its broad strokes. The name *Pure Wisdom* once resounded in antiquity, speaking of the Western Paradise’s bliss. *Wenxing* shines in the present, bearing the intent of the scholar-gentleman.

Some dedicate halls to Confucius, aspiring to learning; others worship the Primal Sovereign, seeking official rank. The Hall of Vast Kindness stands here, the Pavilion of Pure Integrity beside it. To the right, they pay homage to the Dark Heaven; to the left, they gaze upon the Eastern Peak. They invite the guiding masters of Sukhāvatī, seated upon blue lotuses in radiant splendor.

A thousand wheels of wisdom’s power manifest in their forms, unadorned by leaden cosmetics yet draped in jeweled garlands. Like Yuanying’s dazzling white robes, some display their simplicity; like Mingjue’s golden railing’s luster, others proclaim their elegance. Through medicine, they heal and revive the people, needing no ginseng or cassia. Through filial piety, they elevate themselves, transforming the world’s shallow wickedness.

The hall is named *Assembly of Attainment*, its numinous presence profound. A thousand gates spread like five phoenixes in flight, eaves carved high and intricate. Chambers and storerooms stand in order, kitchens and baths rebuilt anew. Zēng Yóu’s brushwork adorns the halls with murals, though some are marred by time’s soot and whitewash.

With all vessels prepared, none remain steadfast to exert their strength. Yet each endeavor reaches completion—not through a single morning or evening’s work. Restored in the Xuānhé era by Zhang, Wu, and Guo, it was later expanded by Xu, Zhou, and others. From Yuánfú to Jǐngyán, renovations and renewals have numbered many.

Praise their loyalty and diligence, which shall plant roots for eons as countless as river sands. How dare I abandon my heart and let it fall to ruin, bowing and rising without shame? Yet the Torch Dragon’s light does not endure forever; the incense’s fragrance fades into obscurity. The musk’s embers have long since died—who can fan them back to life? The great edifice teeters on collapse—who can prop it with a single timber?

Mourning the ancients who vanished like the wind, with whom can I consult? Those yet to come, I shall not hear. Alone, I sigh in sorrow, my cap askew, muttering: *What is this?*

Mountains and valleys shift and intertwine—what era’s path is this? Why scurry like ants on a snail’s horn? Why abandon the root to chase the branch? Why lament aging too soon, shrinking in shame? Why fret in ignorance? Why, like a stolen carriage, meet no Bole to recognize its worth? Why, though skilled in painting, fail to reach the frontier’s craftsmen and remain a mere ink-stained scholar? Why do the ancients leave traces, yet this path is blocked? Why speak of gains without substance? When will the neglected repairs be addressed?

From *Self-Defense of My Writing*
What I have composed, others deem impractical and absurd.

Today’s absurdities may become tomorrow’s enfeoffments and inherited titles. To regard these as proofs of merit and steps to advancement—such is the ignorance of men like you. In former times, works like the *Soushen Ji*, *Shenyi Zhi*, *Youguai Ji*, *Shanhaijing*, and *Youming Lu* were all dismissed as absurd. Yet today, who reads them without a sigh of admiration? Who would say otherwise?

I have read the words of the Sage: *"The Master did not speak of prodigies, force, disorder, or spirits."* Yet in the *Capture of the Lin* and the *Oaths of Alliance*, omens and portents appear repeatedly, recorded without omission. Some criticize these passages, attributing them to the mouths of Gongyang, Zuoshi, and Guliang. But the one who first shaped such accounts cannot evade responsibility—hence the saying: *"Those who understand me do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals; *those who condemn me do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals."* How profound is the difficulty of discerning true talent!

Literature is the public instrument of the world; if it is not in error, what need is there for debate? My own works—I know not whether they are right or wrong. I ask only that they be examined. When Duan Wenchang composed the *Stele of Pingcai*, Prefect Chen Xiang removed it, valuing only the prose of Han Changli. Though Changli is revered by later generations, how could he not know what Su the Academician meant when he said: *"I do not know if the world contains verses like Duan Wenchang’s—how does he compare to Duan Wenchang?"* My own works, though lacking Duan Wenchang’s talent, may be preserved; they must not be discarded. If they are cast aside, even if this record remains, who will speak for it?

I do not seek to preserve these writings to boast before the present age, dazzle future generations, or deceive the ears of the multitude. Rather, when later men attend to the temple rites, reading my record and witnessing my conduct, they will not deceive themselves in the darkness but feel reverence for the spirits arise naturally within them. Since the record is already written, it must be engraved and transcribed—only the right person can be entrusted with this task. Thus, I dare to appeal to your judgment, certain that you will have your reasons.

Dongpo once said: *"In my life, I have never composed eulogies, epitaphs, or tomb steles for others."* Yet when he wrote the biographies of Minister Sima Wen and Duke Fu Han, he declared: *"I dared not firmly refuse, though it was not my true inclination."* If you undertake this stele, is it not to assume the role Dongpo claimed for himself?

Nevertheless, Cai Yong said to Lu Zhi: *"I have written many steles and records, all with some regret—only the* Stele for Guo Youdao *leaves me without shame."* I dare make this plea with the same conviction.

*A Treatise to Silence Slander*

Since assuming my sacred office in the Dao, after universally delivering all beings, I have never once engaged in worldly intercourse. Even when I have uttered a few words or penned a single character, they have been nothing but inducements toward goodness. Yet if the recipient’s essence is not pure enough to resonate, no sign or omen will respond. As for floods, droughts, epidemics, or unforeseen calamities—these are all due to my own lack of virtue. I can only tremble in fear, reflect deeply, and exhaust every means of averting and dispelling them.

Impartial and selfless, I answer doubts as swiftly as an echo. Yet today’s scribes and chroniclers cannot be trusted, for among them lurk those who fabricate illusions—crafty deceivers who borrow the guises of fox spirits and rat demons. They peer through doors, lurk in empty chambers, and embellish their tales, casting lines to hook the gullible and boast of their exploits. How can they claim that men may be deceived, yet the gods deceived as well? As the saying goes: *"One may be fooled, but not utterly deluded."* Fish eyes and true pearls—genuine and counterfeit are plain to see. Let the discerning not be led astray, lest they bring shame upon the divine.

Thus, I set down these words to silence slander:

*The gods inquire in mystery, dwelling in the unseen.*
*How then do brushstrokes transform, their numen sharp and bright?*
*Strung like pearls, inlaid with jade, they gleam like sun and stars.*
*Ban and Zhang’s steeds were unmatched, their worth beyond compare.*
*The life-saving scriptures of Han Kang endure like flowing streams.*
*Guo Jingchun’s geomancy charts the hidden paths of yin and yang.*
*Followers throng with provisions, their carriages blocking the gates.*
*Virtue engraved in human hearts shall last ten thousand years.*

Yet now it is otherwise: the divine conceals itself in heaven.
Appearing without, vanishing within—such is called immortality.
Vague and indistinct, silent and wordless.
Who could have foreseen that night-rats would borrow the fox’s cry,
Twisting truth into confusion, stirring men’s indignation?
Seeking the gods’ favor, they prepare offerings, both male and female.
Whose fault is this? The wretched knave, severed and cast aside—
*"One may be deceived, but not utterly deluded."*
Dare they mock me? Let their sins accumulate until their bodies perish,
Punished by men and cursed by ghosts.

You scholars in your caps, shaped like men yet not men—
Do you think the gods, ever-changing, are deaf to your schemes?
Once revered, now you scramble for profit.
Once obscure, now your temple rites are complete.
Self-promoting, self-hawking—only the gods are shamed.
I lay down my brush and sing, a song long familiar to men’s ears:

*I sing to warn you: do not follow deceit.*
*This text is written to silence slander.*

*Not a divine decree, but a verse like Nüwa’s severing the turtle’s legs—*
*When primordial chaos first parted from Mount Song and Tai.*
*The towering peaks of Heng and Hua—*
*Their gods are called Di and Zhi.*
*Shun piled wood for sacrifice, Yu made his inspections;*
*Qin performed the feng rites, Han offered their prayers.*
*Yet the transmission of the rightful succession remains unproven—*
*Who claims it was a water dragon or a wooden kui?*

*My origins in this world began in Xiaopi.*
*My spirit conceived at Caishi, nurtured by the marvels of Biefeng.*
*Alas, in the fleeting moment of soul’s destruction and spirit’s dissolution,*
*I was summoned from the dark void to gallop through the unseen.*
*Mourning the desolation of the sacred temple,*
*I gaze at the abandoned halls, their grandeur faded.*
*I long to cast off my cap and tear my robes,*
*To see the treacherous paths of the world.*
*The great edifice is collapsing, yet none tend to it—*
*I fear a single timber cannot prop it up.*
*In the year of* zhaoyang *and* dahuangluo*,*
*I sharpen my wits by Luochi.*
*Wielding the writing brush as my voice,*
*I invert truth to expose beauty and ugliness.*
*Some slander with cunning, clamoring loudly,*
*Claiming I deceive with flattery.*
*Flourishing their tongues like petals and leaves,*
*They prattle on like Qin’s courtiers.*
*You, silent and composed, why not stand firm in integrity?*
*Small as a gourd ladle or a midge,*
*How can you fathom the depths with a well’s narrow gaze?*
*Your bellies swollen with parasites,*
*You are no match for the wine-skin’s capacity.*
*The sprouts of* nie *valleys perish by dawn—*
*What use are the short-lived fox’s shadow-watching schemes?*
*Heaven and earth stretch boundless, without end;*
*Life and death surge vast—who can comprehend them?*
*Ruan Zhan’s debates on right and wrong—*
*His bones now crumble to dust.*
*If you say my words lack proof,*
*Then take the sorcerer’s new wheat as your omen.*
*It is said: Heaven’s Way blesses the good and punishes the wicked,*
*As surely as a shadow follows its form.*
*Those who scheme and feign madness,*
*Waver like foxes, full of doubt.*
*Revere the gods as if they stand beside you—*
*I remain silent. What more can I say?*

*Do Not Destroy the Stele*
To destroy the stele is to say it must not be destroyed.
The *ci* are the words that voice its transgressions.
These words say:

*How extreme the deceit of the age has become—*
*Cunning as rats, clever as macaques.*
*With gardenia faces and waxen tongues,*
*You mimic the whispers of your ilk.*
*Your clever paintings strive to surpass dogs and horses,*
*Yet only ghosts and demons occupy your designs.*
*You avoid the great paths to tread the fish and waterfowl’s way,*
*Yet know well the dangers of the road.*
*The ranks of the dark and numinous are dense—*
*They are not like trees, devoid of spirit.*
*Pity the firefly chasing the dark,*
*Calling the long night endless.*
*You beast-faced, speaking like men—*
*Are you not mere apes?*
*Can pythons truly swallow deer?*
*They only twist and shed their scales.*
*You cultivate bravery by shooting at ramie,*
*Yet Yi was ultimately trapped in his own body.*
*Defiling wealth, you suffer calamity—*
*Chong’s greed surpassed even his love for wife and child.*
*When evil accumulates, it harms the full,*
*Yet you cover it with praise and resent the record.*
*You carve your clan’s precious stone,*
*Listening to the wails of your ancestors.*
*The sun sets in a haze of yellow,*
*Suddenly scorching the parched east.*
*Behold the net of heaven, its cords spread wide—*
*Who can escape its three-sided snare?*
*Blowing on cold ashes to make soup,*
*You cling to the heat, refusing to wake.*
*No model to follow, you trace the steps of Han’s fools.*
*Stalking the tripod’s power in secret,*
*Why prattle on with your mouths?*
*Before the drum is buried, its sound is scorched by the sun.*
*Flames blaze—why heed women’s slander?*
*The loyal hearts of great generals burn bright—*
*Why repent of others’ schemes?*
*The public’s judgment has its merits and flaws—*
*It is not bias that favors Han.*
*Moved by the wheel’s hub, I reflect—*
*Knowing the Creator’s preferences.*

*(End of translation)*

The canonical punishments remain complete—
etched for ten thousand generations, never to be erased.
Yet the benighted, knowing nothing,
indulge in wanton malice and stubborn folly.
They burn the transmitted classics to drown the scriptures—
of Shao and Lu, which shall endure?
The white-stone ox cannot bear its trembling slaughter—
ah, what grievous wrong!
Some are swayed by fortune’s shifts,
dying at the gate in vain.
Some tread divergent paths in darkness,
yet face reckoning in warmth.
Is this age so unlike the past?
Deeds bear no karmic fruit.
Or do water and fire rail falsely?
I dare not whisper even to the cautious tortoise.
The black snail is no stranger to the distant Yao—
virtue flows unseen between them.
Thus Heaven blesses the good and curses the licentious,
enforcing the Dao’s decree.
Even when hurling a rat, one fears breaking the vessel—
why do they fail to ponder this?
To cover all eyes with a single finger—
who could thus deceive the heavens?
Heaven’s rafters are vast—
upon whom shall blame fall?
Do not deface the stele—
what excuse could I offer?

Alas! Such are these matters.

*End of Scroll Three of Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes*
*Scroll Four of Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes*
*Ode to the Joyful Rain*

At the Sacred Rain-Praying Ritual of the Venerable Lingji Temple,
we reverently invoked the Enlightened Arhat Bodhisattva,
Founder of Deer Park,
who struck his staff upon the holy waters,
offering devotion—
and swiftly received divine response.
In solemn record of this event,
I compose this *Ode to the Joyful Rain*,
inscribing it upon the Spring Pavilion,
to be passed down for generations,
awakening the resolve of those who seek refuge.

Thus have I heard.
The Master spoke in verse:
While all strain their eyes toward clouds and rainbows,
I, at this very hour, bring down the blessings of rain.
My vow extends boundlessly—
such is the heart of compassion, benefiting all beings.
Why point to wide-open eyes,
only to clutch at the Buddha’s feet in desperate times?
How could one fail to recall the fields of Mulberry Forest,
where prayers were offered to mountains and rivers?
Do mountains and rivers possess spirits?
When drought grows dire,
every stream and peak is cleansed,
no deity left uninvoked—
yet some still ask, *"What use is worshipping spirits?"*
Spirits are not spirits in themselves;
rather, the human heart, moved by sincerity, summons them.
The Master’s numinous power
derives from the Tathāgata’s divine might.
His precepts, virtue, and merit
are likewise beyond comprehension.
The villagers’ faith in him
has stood unshaken for ages.
Over five hundred years,
how many have been sheltered by his grace?

Since last autumn through winter, and now into the third month of spring, not a single drop of rain has fallen, and no seeds have been sown in the earth. Truly, this is a time of dire peril and urgent crisis—who would dare to slaughter geese and soften their blood in sacrifice? To place trust in snake-oil healers would only invite ridicule from those of discernment. Yet it was said: we had heard that within the Chan Master’s sleeve, indolent dragons could be summoned, and with a whip’s command, made to obey. Thus, we came to pay homage and beseech our Master. Following his chariot, rain fell on the day after the *renyin* day, a gentle drizzle spreading in all directions. By the *bingwu* day, the rains had come in full. Young and old alike leapt for joy, their delight mingling in celebration. They declared: *"The Perfected One has opened the mountain rains!"* And so, they offered incense and chanted praises.

**Record of the Eastern Well’s Restoration**
The Eastern Well’s origins are recorded in stone inscriptions, which state: *"In the eighth year of the Xining reign, the year *yimao*, on the thirteenth day of the intercalary eighth month, *yisi*,"*—two hundred and twenty-four years have passed since then. Before the Xining era, when the well’s bricks were first laid, its masonry and railings still stood, bearing the inscription: *"Zhang Jue donates the Eastern Well’s railing"* in six characters. Jue was a man of virtuous renown during the Five Dynasties period. By reckoning, this was the eighth year of the Tianfu reign of the Later Jin, the first year of Tiande in Min—spanning, in total, three hundred and sixty-seven years. For all things, long duration leads to decay: such is the nature of fate. Yet decay may be repaired: this, too, is fate’s design.

The well had silted and collapsed for over forty years, and the simple folk of the village, though not negligent, knew not how to address it. Below, the pit yawned like a bottomless abyss; above, the crumbling edge hung like a sheer cliff, on the verge of breaking yet still clinging—so treacherous that no hand could find purchase. Then, on the second day before the Dragon Boat Festival in the first year of the Dade reign, *wushen*, as the sun neared its setting, a sudden wind and rain arose, and in an instant, the site was reduced to a wasteland of mud and shattered stone. Heaven seemed to lend its hand, compelling men to restore it—truly, this was fate’s decree.

Where there is land, there are people. And the people belong to Heaven. Blessed by Heaven’s fortune, in harmony with Heaven’s timing, and aligned with Heaven’s will, they consulted the omens and found them auspicious. Four days later, on the *yichou* day, laborers were gathered. With no other means, they hauled stones and cleared mud. To the north, on the sunny slope of Bie Peak, grew a vine as thick as seven or eight inches in diameter, its length straight and uncoiled, stretching over seven or eight *zhang*. They used it as a rope—what marvelous craftsmanship of creation! Could this not be Heaven’s aid to its people?

By the seventh day of the month, *jiawu*, stonemasons and earthworkers had assembled, and by *yisi*, the work was complete. Does this not mirror the *yisi* day of the well’s original founding? Or was it Heaven’s doing? It was Heaven’s.

Here follows the translation:

---

Dare I record these events in writing, to show the people and invoke the spirits? The words read:

Heaven aids its people,
Wind and rain respond in kind.
Prophecies align with spirits,
And thus the work began.
Once dredged, it draws from the depths,
Its hidden flow reaching the Milky Way.
Nurturing people and aiding all things,
Its merit and use are vast.
The eight spirits of the eight directions,
The royal kin and the mighty sword.
With martial clamor and military might,
They ward off misfortune and banish ill omens.
People receive its blessings,
Years yield abundant grain.
Drinking from the spring, they know its pulse,
Enveloped in Heaven’s grace.
Restoring the old and renewing the well,
The task is thus accomplished.
May peace and tranquility endure forever—
*Qian*: Origin, prosperity, harmony, and constancy.

**Sealing the Well: An Inscription**
The meaning of the well is profound indeed.
In the heavens, it belongs to the twenty-eight constellations;
In the Five Phases, it is the essence of water;
For people, it serves the needs of drink and sustenance, indispensable even for a single day.
The well cannot be abandoned because its waters nurture people and aid all things.
Yet if it becomes silted and unclean, old and murky, it becomes a forsaken well.
Thus, the sages, in composing the hexagrams, declared:
*A well silted is undrinkable; an old well attracts no birds.*
This is precisely because an old, forsaken well’s mud is unfit to drink.
As for birds and beasts not coming—it cannot nurture people or aid all things, but instead harms them.

To the east of the lane lies the temple grounds, where the mountain rises from Bie Peak, winding and undulating, its rises and falls uncounted, until it settles here. Long ago, someone quarried the mountain to dig a well, excavating until the spring was reached, nearly nine *ren* deep. Yet they feared abandoning the work, for their heart was set on nurturing people and aiding all things—even if it meant wounding the mountain, no harm was done.

But now, one enters the well yet cannot draw water. The well’s purpose is lost.
The thirsty cannot drink,
The soiled cannot cleanse.
The frogs in its depths fall silent,
The fish in its dried ruts nearly perish.
Left unused, it has lain thus for years.
The diviners call it the *Black Warrior pierced by an arrow*,
The physicians, a chronic ailment of the vital organs.
The clamor of opinions is great—this mountain has suffered no small wound.

Since then, customs have changed, and the village has withered.
Men of great talent, now impoverished gentlemen, bear no radiant glory.
The withering, the decay, the drowning in this—what could be worse?
Whom to blame? The fault lies with the well.

In the ninth month of the *gui-si* year of the Zhiyuan era, on the auspicious *bing-zi* day, the villagers proposed sealing the well. They prayed to me, and I answered: "Sealing it is auspicious." Thus, I compose this text to inform the well’s spirit:

Long ago, Geng Gong dug a well fifteen *zhang* deep. He straightened his robes, bowed, and the well gushed forth with water. Yet when Prefectural Clerk Zhu Bo took up residence in an office with over a hundred chambers, all the wells ran dry. Both were wells—why did one benefit Geng Gong but not Zhu Bo? Was this partiality?

May the well’s spirit lower its head and heed this command, replying: "It is not partiality, but fate.
That there was water was fate;
That there was none was also fate.
To open it when there was water, to seal it when there was none—this is proper.
What concern is it to the spirits?"

Yet where fate lies, human effort is tied.
Thus, the proposal to seal it arose.
Seal it, I say:
On this day of sealing, spirits will guard it,
Warding off misfortune and banishing ill omens.
After sealing, may households prosper and suffice,
May people live long and in health.

**On the Difficulty of Temple Restoration**
The responsibility of restoring the temple is arduous indeed—I have heard as much.
Year-round labor, endless expenses—
From dawn to dusk, no respite,
Is it not difficult?
Exhausting ears and eyes, straining strength and thought—
Is it not hard?

The rotted and blackened beams and buckets have now been repaired.
The broken and missing roof tiles have been restored.
The faded red and white hues have been renewed.
Whose work is this? To call it solely one’s own would be excessive;
Yet one might shirk responsibility and evade the difficulty.

Nevertheless, the eastern pond’s inscription has dried up,
The western steps’ stele remains unerected,
The furnishings of the inner and outer halls are unworthy—
What is to be done?
It is like setting out on a thousand-*li* journey, only to turn back at the gate—
This is not the conduct of a true man.
A true man acts with righteousness as his weight,
To see righteousness and not act is cowardice.

Of old, the two sons of the Lord of Gudu stood alone in their conduct, heedless of praise or blame—
Were they acting for gain?
My sense of righteousness arises from innate nature,
As distant from those who seek fame and profit as heaven is from earth.
People far and wide have heard and know this—
Even without consulting spirits, there is no doubt,
So why must I speak so earnestly?

The *Book of Songs* says:
*Though alone in your chamber, be not ashamed before the rafters.*
That which moves the spirits must be fitting.
When the halls are restored, the walls erected, and all things prepared,
Then offer sacrifices and present them,
And reflect upon them—
Reverence will arise naturally.
Otherwise, if one’s demeanor is even momentarily irreverent,
A careless heart will deceive the spirits.
Not only the spirits, but people too.
Not only deceiving others, but deceiving oneself—
What grandeur or solemnity can there be?

Those who later tend to the temple,
Walking these halls and reading this record,
Will surely ask:
Who were the eight who restored the temple?
Who first proposed it?
Who joined in the planning?
At first so diligent, in the end so negligent—
They too are people; what was their intent?

All things under heaven begin well, but few endure to the end.
To excel in both beginning and end—
This is the fulfillment of the human way.

Difficult indeed is this—it is why I hasten so earnestly, seeking to ensure a strong beginning and a successful end.

To your question, I say: today’s scholars cannot proceed without wealth. Heaven does not send rain, spirits do not deliver offerings, the practice of alms-seeking yields nothing, and those willing to give generously are rarely seen. What plan, then, can be devised?

I counsel you thus: when the multitude acts in accord, it must always treat righteousness as its profit. If profit is not taken as righteousness, no one will truly value righteousness, and the endeavor will not endure. Remember well this word: *righteousness*.

I imagine those who joined this work rising abruptly, leaning against the wall, and declaring: “How dare we not accept this?”

**Record of Completion**

Affairs under heaven are not difficult at the outset—only in their conclusion. As the *Book of Songs* says: “All things have a beginning, but few endure to the end.” The *Book of Changes* states: “The fox crossing the river wets its tail”—speaking of how easy the start is, and how hard the finish.

Thus the noble person reveres the beginning and is cautious of the end, maintaining consistency from start to finish. This is called great good fortune. But if one is diligent at first and negligent at last, willingly yielding to the pressure of petty men—such are the schemes of those who achieve nothing. What use are they?

Take, for example, the construction of this temple. At the beginning, there were eight of us. By the end, only seven remained. Of these, only three devoted themselves wholeheartedly. From this, we see clearly: affairs under heaven are not difficult at the start—only in their completion. This is indeed true.

Yet though the difficulty of completion may neither add to nor diminish my own standing, discerning observers will perceive in others the lack of resolve to see things through. How, then, can one hope to cultivate this as a field of blessing and seek its benefits?

Now, six or seven of us have gathered in the courtyard to perform the rites of completion. Our merit lies in the altars of the state. We carve our inscription into metal and stone, that for a thousand generations to come, none may dare to neglect or forget.

As for the offerings—fine livestock, fragrant wine—our rites exceed what is proper, verging on excess. This is truly a shame for me. As the *Rites* in the *Tan Gong* says: “In sacrifice, if reverence is lacking but ritual is abundant, it is better to have ritual lacking and reverence abundant.” Here, both ritual and reverence are fully present. Why, then, does this record of completion seem to reproach me for insufficiency?

The numinous power of the spirits is indeed potent—why, then, do they not bestow a little more of it upon people? Such words are narrow indeed.

Wealth and honor are what all men desire; when desire is unfulfilled, there must be a seeking after it. Now you six or seven men, joining your strength for the royal house, have shown yourselves able to begin well and end well. I know full well that you harbor ambitions of great achievement. Heaven’s Dao and the numinous spirits bless the good. The mountains echo and the valleys respond, answering every sound—why, then, do brush and tongue labor so earnestly to speak for me?

Have you not seen the portraits of meritorious ministers in the Lingyan Pavilion? Twenty-two men in all, yet those whose loyalty endured from beginning to end were but seven: Wei Zheng, Xiao Yu, Duan Zhixuan, Liu Honggong, Yao Silian, Yu Shinan, and Qin Shubao. Now you seven, if you can hold fast to this resolve to the end, may one day rise to the halls of state and take the affairs of the nation as your own responsibility. Why fear you will not match the deeds of those seven in the Lingyan Pavilion? How could your merit be confined to the mere repair of a temple?

I dare offer this as encouragement and append it to the record of completion.

**Exorcism of the Pestilence Ghost**

The *Annals* say: The Marquis of Jin fell ill and dreamed of a bear, which he took to be a pestilence ghost. Later, Han Tuizhi, Liu Yuxi, and others—men renowned for their wisdom and insight, universally admired—also spoke of "malaria ghosts." Some composed texts to drive them away, others wrote poems to dispel them. Only then did people begin to believe that autumn fevers and winter plagues were truly called "ghosts."

Yet ghosts are formless and soundless—how could they sicken men? Moreover, man is the spirit of the myriad things. Heaven covers him, earth bears him, sun and moon illuminate him, wind and rain, frost and dew nurture him through the four seasons. Grain, millet, mulberry, and hemp clothe and feed him. I see how deeply the workings of creation attend to man. If the human Dao is not established, then what we call heaven and earth, sun and moon, wind and rain, frost and dew—I know not what they truly are, save that we name them so. Alas, they would be but lifeless clods!

Since creation has brought forth man in this world, how could it permit such ghosts to afflict the people? It is not the ghost—nor is the ghost the sickness. Rather, it is intemperance in food and drink, indulgence in sensual pleasures, the scorching of the bowels by sweet, sour, bitter, and pungent flavors, the rotting of the stomach. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight disorder the nature and dissolve the spirit. The body is not wood or stone; assailed by so much, how could it not fall ill?

Yet in ancient times, when men fell ill, they were treated with decoctions and acupuncture, and none failed to recover and live. Now, when men fall ill, neither decoctions nor acupuncture can reach them. Alas, truly are these ghosts obstinate and unyielding to transformation!

I, by the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, guard this land and govern its people. If any bring poison and harm to my people, I shall consult the *Laws of the Mysterious Code of the Female Celestial* and decree that they be beheaded a thousand thousand times, their forms severed ten thousand ten thousand times, until all are reduced to hares scurrying into their burrows, with none left as fish slipping through the net. Only then may my people’s desires be fulfilled.

Now, as the Lower Prime announces a general amnesty, I shall recite a verse by Master Du and proclaim it thus:

*You, with skulls blood-smeared and grim,*
*I seize and hurl back to Magistrate Cui!*
*Ghost, if you have any power, flee—flee—flee!*
*Linger but a moment, and the Heavenly Axe falls!*

Written on the *jiazi* day of the second lunar month in spring, the eighth year of the *Kaibao* reign of the Song (Year of *Yihai*), by the Old Man of Biefeng.

**Exorcism of the Drought Demon**

You, whose name is drought, are called *Chi*. I know your ancestor was the Flame Clan, who ruled the world by the virtue of fire and rendered great service to the people, earning the revered title of Flame Emperor. Your lineage was once illustrious, yet how degenerate you have become, so base and unworthy! Your form is hideous, your nature perverse. Even the poison of *Bifang* and the calamity of *Huilu* are not as severe as you.

When the Xia sovereigns cast images upon their tripods, you were so terrified that you led your kind to flee to the lands of the tattooed and black-toothed peoples, where you have dwelled for many years. Once, you vied for dominance with the *Kuafu* clan, reversing the sun’s shadow to chase them between the valleys of *Cigu*, but parched and weary, you sought to drink the waters of *Mingbo* and the great marshes, only to fail. Thus, you stole life by surreptitiously drinking from the rivers of the human world, nearly draining the Luo and the Yellow in a single draught. This led to the *Song of Mulberry Grove* reaching the heavens, whereupon your crime was judged, and you were nearly exterminated.

King Xuan of Zhou and Duke Jing of Qi treated you with benevolence, sparing your punishment. Since then, your remnant seed has spread and multiplied to this day.

I, by the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, guard this land and govern its people. The people toil year-round, for food is their heaven. The heart of Heaven cherishes my people—how could it not transform, how could it not send rain? Who is to blame if not you? The grain is about to ear, the millet to ripen—do you not consider this, yet bring such ruin upon them?

Though you bear the form of man and the nature of things, examine your heart—can you truly bear this? The straw chariot is prepared, the provisions are ready. I pour you a cup of clear water and solemnly declare: The lands of the tattooed and black-toothed peoples, your ancient homeland, lie south of the sea. You may reach them by evening if you depart at dawn.

Now I make this pact with you: By the end of this day, gather your companions, take your kin, ride the dust and spread the wind, and set forth at once. If you do not heed these words, proving yourself obstinate and insensate, I shall invoke the *Laws of the Mysterious Code of the Female Celestial*. Any who harm the people and creatures of the land—all shall say they deserve death, and they shall be killed. Heaven has its records and its net; punishment will reach you, and there shall be no regret.

Thus, this proclamation.

**Exorcism Text to Drive Away Toad Miasma**

Locusts shall not cross our borders; tigers shall flee with their cubs in tow—this is the sacred duty of those who guard the land, the righteous act of ridding the people of harm. Now, this miasma is called the "Toad." Here, I compose this text to banish it.

I once read in the *History of the Southern Dynasties* of a man named Qiu Jie, who fell ill after eating raw vegetables. Years later, he dreamed his mother told him: "This is the poison of the toad. I leave you three pills—take them." He did, and voided several *dou* of toad spawn. Thus, the harm wrought by toads is indeed true.

Of the creatures born of water, there are three hundred and sixty kinds. Among them, the toad is the most despised in Heaven and Earth. Its form is grotesque, its limbs scrabbling in the sand. Its belly swells, its throat constricts. Its color blends with mud, its diet is filth and dung. It leaps upon well-rails, rests in crumbling cliffs. Its dwelling is foul, its appearance vile. Day and night, it croaks, enslaved to demons.

"Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me—what place has the toad?" Yet some say: The toad’s essence is a demonic thing. When the moon is full, it puffs its gut, bares its gaping maw, and raves in triumph. In the green-black void, it capers, devouring the essence of the Great Yin, disrupting Heaven’s order, ravaging Heaven’s creations. Such a witless beast—if even Heaven cannot endure it, how much less can man?

Now the people—what crime have they committed to suffer such afflictions? The malady begins at the tip of a hair, festers in the joints and bones. At first, it brings stupor and blockage, dizziness and confusion. As it advances, the body twists, the sinews weaken, the waist grows heavy, the head spins. Nasal mucus flows like rain, the throat swells with phlegm, spittle and vomit choke the chest. Within, parched; without, desiccated—thirst without thirst—until searing heat erupts. Folk remedies and coal fumes, the fires of disaster, leave scorched heads and blistered brows, as though seated in a pit of flames. Even were one to ride the giant spirit, seize the Dipper’s ladle, and scoop the waters of the Bohai Sea to drench the flames, it would not suffice for relief. Some, born under the signs of *chen* and *xu*, sweat until the fever breaks. Others, once the heat subsides, are left with a dry cough that lingers for days, worsening without respite.

I trace the source—whose fault is this? Is it not the autumn acting as summer, the imbalance of yin and yang? Or the five flavors indulged without restraint, the excesses of food and drink? Or the eyes fixed on dark and bright, the ears enslaved to lewd songs, the unchecked pursuit of sound and sensuality? What physician cannot cure it with medicine? What moxibustionist cannot apply the mugwort stove? The curses of the exorcist crackle like thunder, the talismans of the talisman-master slash like blades—yet the heart labors in vain, the eyes grow weary, and all efforts yield no result, their effects delayed. The people’s grievances converge upon one culprit: the toad.

I, entrusted by the Supreme Emperor to govern this land and care for its people, find the toad still defiantly alive. It fills ditches as ghosts, becomes a demon-chief, a *chimei*, a *wangliang*, lurking in the dark, crouching in shadows. Treacherous and perverse, it stirs cruelty and oppression, devoid of mercy. The shadow-shooting of the short fox, the venom of the grass-biting centipede—none compare to the harm you wreak. Your crimes tower to the heavens; the people all cry for your death.

Now I make this pact with the toads: Gather your kind within a single day and relocate together to the east of Lake Wanshan, where you may eke out a living, a borrowed existence—so long as you no longer harm my people. If not—if you remain stubborn and senseless, heedless of this warning—I shall commission the *Guo* clan to burn your dens and drown you in ash-laced wine. Then I will sever your heads, split your bellies, mince your flesh, and share it with the people to feast upon. Your kind must be eradicated to satisfy the people’s desires.

Hearing these words, the toads trembled in fear. Donning green robes, they knelt in the courtyard, begging for their lives: "The willow-wheeled carts are ready, the red grass packed. We willingly submit and depart today. Spare us, O King, and pardon our crimes."

Thereupon, I composed this decree to hasten their departure:

*"Clear and upright, I embody the divine.
By Heaven’s mandate, I cherish the people below.
O wretched toads, creatures of malevolence,
Rejoicing in calamity, why so cruel?
Defying Heaven’s decree, you disrupt the seasons.
The people’s qi stagnates, their paths grow treacherous.
Even Lu and Bian despair, their skills in vain.
The shamans chant and chew, their arts shrouded in darkness.
What crime have the people committed to endure such suffering?
O wretched toads, your sins overflow.
The people’s wrath gathers—your name is cursed.
They long to gnaw your bones, to mince your flesh.
My fury blazes like thunder and lightning.
I entrust the Guo clan to execute justice.
Kneeling in the courtyard, you plead for mercy—
A single cry for life, a reprieve from ten thousand deaths.
O wretched toads, if you truly possess spirit,
Hear my words and reform.
The towering peaks of Wanshan, the limpid waters of the lake—
There lies your refuge, your haven of peace.
Go deep, hide far, vanish from sight.
Depart swiftly, swiftly—hasten as the law commands!"*

Composed in the third month of the *dingwei* day, spring of the eighth year of *Kaibao* in the Song dynasty (975).

**Ode on the Exorcism of Toads**

The people of Yue revere omens and believe in slaughter—an ancient custom, unshaken even now. When illness strikes, they grieve and fret. Yet the shamans and mediums warn: "Without *ginseng* and *poria*, the cure demands blood." Some slander and deceive, currying favor with the crowd. Thus, I compose this *Ode on the Exorcism of Toads* to justify my actions. Its words read:

*"Alas, the world turned upside down—
The square wears the cap of the round.
Yin congeals into sores, the springs surge and flow.
Nightly, the blood-dripping specter roams the perilous forests.
The archer-demon lurks, listening for shadows to strike.
How can the pebble of Yan be mistaken for pearls?
The quack’s concoctions muddle yellow millet—who can tell true from false?
They accept tiles as gold, their thunderous clamor drowning the music of the *Xianchi* Pool.
They praise the beauty of the *Mo* mother, while the idle *Zou* son grows profligate and shameless.
A wild bird enters the house—what omen does it bring?
The people lament and mourn.
The world craves the dregs of wine and pickled fare,
Yet I would feast on chrysanthemums and weave orchids.
The customs of the age oppress—
Moths drawn to the flame, ants to the lamp.
The six excesses arise from imbalance—
Why blame frost and dew?
The cases of Shen and Tai Luo prove it—
Are these not strange and unnatural?
They brandish spears and arrows like divining stalks,
Their words filthy, their claims absurd.
The dragon-horse reveals its form—
Later, Fu Xi deciphered its celestial patterns.
To kill in pursuit of life—
Even the southern wind cannot reverse it.
The bandits rage, drunk with power—
They deem all wood sacred.
The *Kui* burns for its recklessness—
The land suffers ever-greater drought.
Better to swallow charcoal and wail,
Or face the wall and meditate.
What crime have the fish and *zong* committed that the skies darken,
Their qi tangled in resentment?
They borrow the *Huiping* from the postmaster,
Bewildered by the snake in the cup.
They usurp creation’s harmony, tuning the pipes,
Hoping to thaw the ice and revive spring.
The mother clings to her child as the greatest concern,
Yet they cling to darkness, lost in ignorance."*

To call *changyang* useless for prolonging life—
Then why seek *fuling*?
The net’s mesh tightens, the body ensnared—
Alas, how can the valley’s whale endure?
Thus one drifts through the world’s currents,
Yet remains deluded by omens, never awakening.
Moving the firewood earns no virtue—
The guest’s brow is scorched, his face seared.
Who is to blame?
The base man’s gluttony, his schemes spun in cunning words.
The ringleaders of sin—
Men indict them, ghosts demand their due.
Borrowing metal and iron to slaughter,
They cast down order and plunge into chaos.
Calling wrong right, right wrong—
Do they not invert all things?
Man’s triumph over heaven’s decree cannot deceive—
Light endures, darkness fades.
Vying in their mad rush,
The tumors burst in ruin.
Truly lamentable—
Who would don a cap and shake their robes now?
Beat the drum to rouse their stupor, illuminate their blindness—
Yet gloom lingers, unyielding.
Better to refuse all words—
Without me, all would perish.
Hair unbound, stammering—

*From the* Han History.

**Office of Blessing Registration, Temple of Numinous Aid**

By reverent decree of the Three Heavens’ Gate, it is commanded: To all the common people, We bestow blessings upon you.
Those who receive this blessing receive the blessing of Heaven.
Heaven, in its hidden efficacy, watches over the people, first harmonizing their dwellings—how dare I overstep its will?
Proclaim to the lords of our allied states, the governors, the many officers, and the stewards: Hearken to Our words.
What the people desire, let it be your concern—make them flourish and prosper, prosper and grow great, daily richer, daily longer-lived, daily in peace and well-being.
Let them have enough to honor their fathers and mothers above, and to provide for their wives and children below.
May a hundred blessings come to them in full, that the people may find them fitting.
You shall thus fulfill your duties. Let this office, in accordance with the decree, respectfully heed and faithfully implement it.

Among scholars, the virtuous are called *junzi* (noble persons).
Thus Mencius said: Cultivate your Heaven-bestowed nobility, and human rank will follow.
Confucius said: Speak with few faults, act with few regrets, and emolument lies therein.
This is what is meant by the noble person’s service—acting in accordance with rightness.
1. Rank to govern their nobility.

Though this be the prerogative of the Grand Steward, it is your duty, O sovereigns.

Proclaim to the lords of our allied states, the governors, the many officers, and the stewards: Hearken to Our ancient charge.

*Scroll Six of Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes*

**Preface on Friendship**

Those who share the same path are called *peng* (companions); those who share the same aspirations are called *you* (friends). The meaning of friendship lies in neither flattery nor deceit, neither extravagance nor indulgence. It must first be realized in the heart before it can be called true kinship. If companionship exists without sincerity, it is mere superficial association. If friendship exists without sincerity, it is but a face-value friendship. The noble person does not partake in such.

Now, you have sought from me inscriptions for paintings, and I have named them after the *Five Friends*: Friend Pine, Friend Bamboo, Friend Plum—these are the *Three Friends of Winter*. Friend Orchid—this is what Confucius meant when he said, "Dwelling with a good person is like entering a room of orchids and iris; over time, one no longer detects the fragrance, for one has become one with it." Friend Chrysanthemum—truly, does not the chrysanthemum embody the Dao of the noble person with its noble fragrance? The meaning of these *Five Friends*—can it not be trusted?

In painting, nothing is more difficult than capturing the true likeness. Yet capturing the likeness is not the greatest challenge—capturing the form is harder still. But even capturing the form is not the hardest—capturing the heart is. Human hearts differ as widely as their faces. The noble and the petty may appear similar in countenance, but their hearts are not the same. If one abandons the heart and seeks only the outward form, one reduces the noble to the petty. Though this painting exists, who does not possess such a painting? Now that you have named these *Five Friends*, you must take the heart as your enduring companion. Thus it is said: *To judge by form is not as good as to judge by heart.*

**A Record of the Painter**

I once read Liu Zihou’s *Biography of the Carpenter* and Han Tuizhi’s *Biography of the Decayed Wang Chengfu*, and was deeply moved. The purpose of a biography is to transmit a name. Reflecting on those times, carpenters and decayed men were as common as flowing water—why were only Yang Qian and Wang Chengfu remembered? As the Grand Historian once told Ren An: "In ancient times, those who were wealthy and noble yet whose names were erased are beyond counting." These two men gained their fame through the biographies written by those two masters—how fortunate they were!

Now, there is a man who makes himself known through painting. I fear his name may not be transmitted to posterity, so I dare to follow the example of the ancients and compose this record for him:

In Jishan Village of Min, there has stood the Temple of the Divine Aid King for many years. Its painted decorations had long faded into obscurity, its walls crumbling, nearly becoming a den for spring worms and autumn snakes. In the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan era, the villagers restored it, wishing to repaint and renew it. Soon, those who licked brushes and ground ink arrived in droves, but no decision was made on whom to employ. They consulted me, but I refused their request. The villagers were astonished, finding it strange—was there some master who had stripped off his robes and sat cross-legged, yet had not yet arrived?

One day, a painter suddenly appeared, moved by a dream. Only then did they believe my words were true. Observing the man, he was steadfast and upright, refined and untrammeled by俗, dressed in the robes of a scholar. He did not speak his name, nor did anyone know his origins. That day, when gentlemen gathered to discuss integrity, he sighed and said: "The greedy follow profit, the heroic follow fame. I have come for fame, not for profit. My name has long been known in other lands, but this region has not yet heard of it. Let me try—if I succeed, so be it." The temple’s protective walls bore old, incomplete paintings, so he was ordered to complete them with his brush. He rose eagerly, though a trace of reluctance remained—his skill had yet to be proven. The onlookers clapped their hands and laughed, saying: "He has a hollow reputation! This is nothing but copying gourds or tracing horses from diagrams—what is there to praise?"

I then assigned him to paint the eastern and western galleries and admonished him: "Painting has six principles: first, *qi* and movement that bring life; second, bone and strength in brushwork; third, responding to things and capturing their forms; fourth, applying colors according to their kind; fifth, planning and positioning; sixth, transmission and copying. In your painting, you must consider these six principles and seek beyond mere form. Perhaps then you will succeed."

The painter replied: "Understood."

Thereupon, he ground cinnabar, sipped white pigment, diluted ink, and thickened smoke. Grasping his brush, he studied intently, and after several days, completed the work. He painted armored warriors, one hundred and twenty-eight in total: two commanding generals, two seal-bearers, two standard-holders, four axe-wielders, two charioteers, two umbrella-bearers, two hat-attendants, two executioners, four messengers and order-givers, two interpreters, four gong-and-drum strikers, two cymbal players, two advancing with Han Xin sabers, eight standing at attention with slashing sabers, twenty-six with spears at hand and swords at waist, four vanguard formation-arrangers, two name-flag bearers, four signal-flag bearers, two merit-flag bearers, sixteen bearing the Eight Trigrams and Eight Arrays flags, two falconers, eight tribute-bearers from the southern lands, and the rest wielding bows, arrows, halberds, spears, and polearms, all in service. Their appearances were imposing, their ranks disciplined, their momentum continuous, their movements coordinated from head to tail. Orderly and systematic, precise and reasoned—truly, they embodied the strategies of the *Six Secret Teachings* of the Grand Duke and the military methods of Sun Wu.

Additionally, there were two retinues of attendants, forty-eight in all, their waists adorned with gold and purple, dutifully carrying out their tasks. They led and followed, flanked left and right, their artistry so exquisite it seemed as though real people were present. All who saw it marveled, saying: "Your painting is indeed masterful! Why was it so crude before, yet so refined now? Why was it so inferior before, yet so excellent now?" As the ancients said: *"Great skill appears clumsy; great wisdom appears foolish."*

That, indeed, is what it means.

The painter Ni Shou slowly replied: "What your servants painted before was merely capturing appearances to complete forms, fulfilling their structures to serve their functions. Others may have intentions, but divining them is no easy task—heart and tongue contend. What is called 'clumsy' and 'foolish' is truly so.

What your servants paint today arises from the heart, envisioned in the mind’s eye, spiritually grasped and intuitively understood, flowing with the moment as the brush is commanded, in harmony with nature. We do not know why it becomes refined or crude, nor why it becomes excellent or inferior. We simply exhaust our artistry in the doing, not employing any cunning or clever technique.

Then, can the fame of your servant’s painting truly be discussed?"

When the painting was finished, he inscribed it on the wall: *"Painted by so-and-so on such-and-such a day and month."* The inscription merely records the name.

Alas! If he were like that, then he too would seek fame through painting in the world and for posterity.

Ah! When a man is born with a seven-foot frame, he is the most numinous being between heaven and earth. With mulberry bow and reed arrows, his aspirations extend to the four directions. He must establish himself, practice the Dao, and make his name known to later generations to honor his parents—only then is a man’s duty complete. Otherwise, he is as if gagged and silenced, stifled and confused, content to be a jar or urn, like a brewing insect, growing old and dying to rot with the grasses and trees. Compared to the painter, would he not feel shame?

Who is this painter? Cai Mengchen of Yurong.

Who wrote the biography of Cai Mengchen? The Xuanfeng Lingji King.

**Postscript to Zhou Zhuangweng’s Stele Inscription**

What I have written before and after is merely for my own amusement—truly, like a wild dog eating celery, unaware of the sting in its mouth or the pain in its belly, how could it know the taste?

Yet I am unworthily honored by your lofty friendship and pure prose, flowing like the mighty Yellow River. Your praise of my virtue shines resplendently.

As for the numinosity of mountains and rivers and the flourishing of people, there must surely be those of extraordinary talent, Daoist arts, loyalty, and integrity born among them. Like you, who harbor ability and hold potential, long suppressed—if you could rouse yourself to stand out and respond to your circumstances, even slightly, it would be my deepest hope.

What I call the *spiritual* is virtue rooted in intelligence and uprightness, aligned with the seasons in its timing and applied to the myriad things with appropriateness. It is not the kind of spirit that flatters or curries favor to bring fortune.

Of the hundred things seen morning and night, no one pays them heed. But when something extraordinary is heard of, all gaze upon it and speak of it. What you have asked me to postscript is also in hope of such extraordinary work.

*"The song ends, no one is seen— / On the river, several green peaks remain."* Is this not a poem of the spiritual? I dare use it to express my gratitude.

**Postscript to Zhou Zhuangweng’s *Explanation of the Yi Diagrams***

"Lingji" is merely a temple name—why is it called a *king*? Those who hear of it cannot avoid offending the brush of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.

Though I dare not refuse the honor of writing a postscript to your *Explanation of the Diagrams*, the profound meanings of the *Yi* are most abstruse—how can they be fathomed with a bamboo tube or a gourd dipper?

I wished to take up my brush but feared being laughed at by those who carry firewood. Thus, I have gathered the discussions of earlier scholars and, with effort, written this postscript. If I have not fully grasped your intent in the middle, I have trimmed it away—may you find it fortunate.

The study of the classics has long been unclear. Our dynasty venerates schools and cultivates talent, placing the illumination of the classics as the foremost duty. The authorities promote education and governance, and for each classic, an instructor is appointed to guide its study—such is the earnest and diligent intent of their instruction.

Of all the classics, the *Yi* is the most profound and recondite, not easily understood in its entirety. Those who study Wang Bi’s *Yi* engage in lofty discourse on principle, but their flaw is reckless extravagance. Those who study Jing Fang’s *Yi* rigidly adhere to images and numbers, but their flaw is inflexibility. Gaining in one aspect means losing in another; in the end, both are lost.

Master Jianxin Zhou of Sanshan, known as Gongbi in his official travels, possesses the *Yi Shaozheng Transmission* handed down in his family. It harmonizes both principle and images, and its words are purely and correctly derived.

The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams, and each hexagram discusses its primary line. Each line has its image, for which a diagram is made. Each diagram has its principle, for which an explanation is given. The explanations grasp principle, the diagrams grasp images and numbers—unified in one thread, they proceed without contradiction.

I say that Master Zhou’s study of the *Yi* is refined—how could this be achieved in a single morning or evening?

The son of a skilled archer learns to make baskets; the son of a skilled furrier learns to make fur garments. If the transmission is not correct, how could one create diagrams and explanations that fully grasp the essence of the *Yi*?

One day, a fellow student of Master Zhou—unknown to me—tucked the diagrams and explanations into his sleeve and sought my opinion. I am ignorant and unlearned; glancing at them, though not easily understood, I grasped a thing or two. It is like food: when it comes to rare delicacies from distant lands, who would not crave them?

I wished to write a postscript for carving and printing, to spread its transmission and not betray Master Zhou’s learning. Yet I fear my name is obscure and unworthy of the task.

Master Zhou’s given name is Zhuangweng, his courtesy name Zhibo, and Jianxin is his sobriquet. Those with whom he associates are all distinguished individuals—they will surely write a postscript for him.

Should I let these diagrams and explanations be used to cover jars? How fitting indeed.

In the third year of the *Dade* era, on the fourth day after the Double Ninth Festival of the *Daxian Yuan*, inscribed by the Man of Biefeng Mountain.

Emulating Jingchun’s *Qianzhou Record* to mark the title:

High ridges and deep valleys—who presides over them?
Why the mounds and trees, if not for the sages Fu Xi and the Yellow Emperor?
By middle antiquity, the northern lands flourished.
When Master Red Pine ascended as an immortal, where was the *Green Satchel*?
The study of post-heavenly arts—Guo, Li, Huang, and Yang—
A raging torrent daily overturned, grains scattered like Sun Bin’s ruse.
Tigers and dogs confused, pointing at the faintest glimmer.
The eyes of the vulgar miss what lies beside them.

The great transformations of Heaven and Earth—these are the records, these are the guiding principles.
Who revealed their subtlety? The clouds and mountains, vast and indistinct.
To exalt earth and honor the self, branches and leaves spread their fragrance.
The chief of the celestial stars governs the great constancies.
In pairs, deer and horses; in abundance, clouds and sunlight.
The sun rises from the blue sea, illuminating the four directions.
The moon nears the imperial throne, its radiance gracing the western palace’s splendor.

Heaven engenders water—its source deep, its flow long.
Emerging from the void of heaven, entering the Great One.
The *Gouchen* strides forth, the *Tengshe* conceals its treachery.
From the eastern ancestor to the western, forming abysses and marshes.
Girded with gold and jade, noble attendants stand by.
Who says the vine bears no flowers or fruit?
Consult the illustrated classics—gourds fit the pattern.
Observe the ancestral dragon: its momentum arrives, its form rests.
If it coils with affection, its "ears" must be ample.

On an auspicious day, at a propitious hour, the west responds with omens.
Not for oneself, but for one’s descendants.
How could the dragon’s path be clear if its head and tail are severed?
What delights is the celestial emolument, stretching a thousand *li*.
Blowing and plucking to avert peril, welcoming spirits and expelling ghosts.
When mountains halt, they become feet—beware the rut.
Mistaking the ox’s slumber, one still laments the hare’s flaw.
Yin flourishes, Yang wanes—each holds to its measure.
This is nature’s way, not the work of human hands.

With a keen mind and focused gaze, what need for needles or stones?
The ancients said: "The fortunate are blessed in abundance."
Kong’s tomb endures to this day, neither brambled nor thorned.
After divination and burial, its yin influence deepens further.
For a hundred generations, it shall prosper, like vines spreading melons.

I am no Qing Wu, yet I divine Zhou’s auspiciousness.
I record and leave this, inscribing it upon the stele.

**Inscription:**
*(The inscription would follow here, untranslated as it was not provided in the original text.)*

An old master holds a spade in hand,
seated upon a wicker chair, driving away the green serpent.
The serpent transforms into a dragon, encircling my home.
Who says the melon vine bears only flowers at its stem?
The pine roots twist and coil, its branches lush and full.

No need to stretch the feet—ox horns rise in jagged peaks.
No need to turn the mirror—no crooked topknots appear.
Facing the desk, brows aligned, skillfully adorning the six *ga*.
Girded with gold, bound with jade, fame gathers in the capital.
Radiance clings to sun and moon, brush and hemp wielded in the imperial academy.

Encountering a scholar on the path, his hidden merit startles—how admirable!
Is this carving truth or falsehood?
Thus inscribed upon stone, for the beholder’s pride.

The spirit of ancestral virtue—no human effort can surpass it.
From generation to generation, like roots intertwined, like reeds uprooted together.

**On Reading**
To read is to teach the people the Way of kinship and harmony.
At eight, one enters the lesser school;
at fifteen, the greater.
What is learning? It is learning from books.
Books—books! Their purpose: to record and compose, to craft words for fame and fortune alone?
Yet the essence lies in the Way of kinship and harmony, the greatest of human relations.
Observe how the sages taught the people to cherish kinship and harmony—it is recorded in books.
Those of noble intent must study deeply, ponder, and inquire.
If one knows the Way’s natural course, first practice it in oneself and in the home,
then let it shape the village, and from one village, reach the world.
To transform the people and refine customs—what is this if not the Way of kinship and harmony?
Thus the governance of all under heaven begins with loving one’s kin.
To read is to teach the people the Way of kinship and harmony.

**On Weiqi**
*Preface:*
One day, a guest in tattered robes and hempen sandals, appearing unkempt, raised his voice and challenged the painter:
"Kinship Hall—this is the spirit’s intent in teaching the people.
Yet in your painting, books have sincerity, the zither has harmony, and paintings have praise—all seem slightly inadequate to the spirit of kinship and harmony.
The art of weiqi arose in the Warring States, teaching the people the ways of war.
But to harbor deceit and cunning, to vie in falsehood—this is not the path of the wise.
I fear it does not embody the spirit’s intent for teaching kinship and harmony."
The painter had no reply and turned to me. I offered this explanation:
The board is square, reflecting the self.
The path is straight, without bias.
Black and white stones mark distinction.
Their paired arrangement sets order.
Adap

This volume lacks two texts at its end, as noted in the catalog.

**Xu Xian’s Hanzao, Volume Seven: Poetry**

*Ancient and Modern Poems from the Upper Forest Prefecture Judgeship*

Secluded, I withdraw from worldly affairs,
Silent, I watch the rise and fall of dynasties.
Once I knew it as Han,
Now I reckon it as Tang.
Deep mounds turn to valleys,
The blue sea becomes mulberry fields time and again.
Kuafu races a thousand li,
While slanderers measure but a foot in height.
Who is foolish, who wise?
What is long life, what is untimely death?
Ants cling to their cauldrons, mindless,
Moths flutter toward the flame, aimless.
Joy drains the heart first,
While sorrow drives locusts from the fields.
The hawk dies for lack of sight,
The fish perishes for greed of bait.
Human nature is as fickle as a palm,
Customs shift with the thaw and frost.
The treacherous waves of the Three Gorges,
The rugged paths of Mount Taihang.
Ill-starred, the Han ox and Dipper clash,
Fated apart, Shen and Shang never meet.
A flick of the finger—regret spans millennia,
A turn of the head—a dream dissolves.

How rich were Jin and Chu in their boasts,
How cunning Su and Zhang in their schemes.
The silken-armed snatch their brother’s food,
The upright testify against their father’s sheep.
The gibbon chatters endlessly,
Tigers tear each other in their ferocity.
Rats stand on ceremony, bowing,
Oxen stumble, wild and reckless.
The white eagle seizes the cunning hare,
The yellow sparrow snaps up the mantis.
The whole world wages war like beasts,
Only the phoenix sings of wounded times.
Poetry and books lie high on dusty shelves,
The path of benevolence and righteousness grows ever more desolate.
Rouge and powder intoxicate the markets,
Red gates resound with pipes and flutes.
Who knows the bamboo slips, inked in haste,
Lie buried in coffins of yellow cedar?
The *Hai* character misread as "pig,"
The *Zhang* jade inscribed as "hawk."
Colors blur black and white,
Techniques favor the dark and yellow.
Grain buys a post as Commandant,
Wealth secures a rank as Cavalier Attendant.
Talented men stagnate by the Liao River,
Heroes hide in Mangyang.
Desperate, they scramble for fame’s tablets,
Relentless, they tangle in profit’s reins.
Lofty caps mock the rustic ways of Lu,
Left lapels imitate the barbarian Du.
Every tongue speaks the language of Yue,
Every body bears tattoos in the light.
Vile words constantly assail the ears,
Carving flesh cannot heal the wound.
Carving wood—what cruel law!
Planting melons—what flawed governance!
Heaven’s course often loses measure,
Yin qi rises to invade yang.
Sun and moon spin like a millstone,
Heaven and earth drift like a boat unmoored.
Floating clouds stretch endlessly,
The earth below vast and boundless.
The four seas choke with dust and mist,
The Central Plains seethe with war.
Warlords vie for hegemony,
The Five Dynasties lose the royal net.

In Fujian, I serve as a minor official,
In Jiankang, I guard the fief as a vassal.
My fame resounds east of the sea,
My virtue blankets the southern lands.
Blood sacrifices endure for a thousand sacrifices,
My spirit dwells in this place.
The old shrine nears ruin,
The ancient temple fears collapse.
The flood of grace now gathers,
Yet the swallow’s nest remains dim.
No harm in divining with chicken bones,
To restore the hall of the sidelong glance.

The paintings rival Changkang’s walls,
The clay revives the walls of Master Kong.
Gongshu follows the compass and square,
The Minister of Rites adorns the robes.
The work is done with ease,
The stele’s completion is my earnest hope.
From Zhongshan, I pluck the finest brush,
From Zhenze, I fell the darkest wood.
Fish-skin sifted clean of sand,
Phoenix and tortoise take wing together.
Empty words are mere recklessness,
Yet actions are frantic and perverse.
Dark learning knows fortune and misfortune,
Golden rules reveal hidden treasures.
Wen Qin and Han Yu,
Sentences admired by Duan Wenchang.
What merit lies in trampling grass?
What strength in butting against Zhuangzi?
Tomb talks transmit the teachings of Lu,
Pavilion records dream of the Prince of Teng.
Poems praise the spirit of Mount Tai,
Prose is not the ghost wailing in the beams.
Ancient texts confirm these words,
Sacrificial rites demand solemnity.
To succeed the sages is to follow Mengzi alone,
To know Heaven is to fear no correction.
If this culture is not yet lost,
How can our Dao fail to shine?

I admire the Master’s conduct,
Vying to transmit the fragrance of the noble man.
Born like a striped leopard in the mist,
Tempered like dragon’s brew in old vats.
Jade and coral trees,
Gold and sable tails.
Calligraphy refined as Wang Xizhi’s,
Script bold as Zhong You’s.
Pouring water reveals its brilliance,
Stroking the void stirs its fervor.
The capture of the qilin nearly ended his brush,
The presentation of white silk awaits his memorial.
My meager virtue pales in shame,
His lofty talent deserves exaltation.
As you are praised for your fine reputation,
Accumulated goodness brings abundant blessings.
The name endures as long as the record,
Forget the man, but not the spirit.
Ashamed I lack silk to offer in condolence,
I pray for blessings to ward off misfortune.

Ascending and descending, the immortals scatter as guests of the Three Isles,
Ethereal and elusive, beyond all measure.
Your soul stands resolute as a ghostly hero,
For you alone are wise and upright.
The people of Jing revere ghosts,
The people of Yue honor cunning—
An old custom since the Spring and Autumn period.
How restless I am in this world,
Driving alone on a desolate road, moved to tears.
I have no belligerent heart to toy with alchemy,
Who would willingly seal themselves in silence?
I honor Confucius and Mengzi, advance Han and Liu,
Reject Buddhism and Daoism, condemn Yang and Mo.
I seek to exalt filial piety and brotherly love, discard the strange and extravagant,
To return to frugality and value sincerity.
Pointing at the air, writing in astonishment—truly strange!
Surely the people of Luoyang do not recognize this.
Alas! The Shu roads are steep and perilous,
Tigers and leopards vie to devour.
No news from the trees or the waters,
Only the village hypocrite—thief of virtue.
Who knows that in the dark room, spirits watch?
Willingly becoming ghosts and demons with petty men.
*Bok bok*, *zhuo zhuo*—the sound at the door,
The lonely owl’s cry, the screeching of birds, all clamoring.
Profit and wealth stride across the altar,
Eerie words shock the crowd with their deceit.
Who is not a Bian He or a Zhen,
Holding their hearts, unaware of others’ scorn?
The old man of Liqiu, drunk and raving,
How can one not clap in approval of the extraordinary?
Disloyal in planning, untrustworthy in friendship,
Fleeing to the clouds, their traces erased.
Jade cannot be burned on Kunlun’s peaks,
Orchids and thoroughwort must not mix with thorns.
Good rewarded, evil punished—like the ruins of Guo,
Coming events are as dark as lacquer.
Heaven bestows bright wings not by chance,
I only fear that literature will be severed and lost.
Who is the Master of the Eastern Village?
The elders’ model, esteemed above all.
The purple aura of Fengcheng shoots toward the Dipper and Ox,
In youth, his fame and brilliance blazed.
The river and mountains share the moonlight for a thousand li,
The autumn light perfectly embraces the emerald waters.
Worldly affairs change in an instant, bitterly inconstant,
Midstream, the swimmer struggles against the surging waves.
Pure and secluded, I leave the dust behind,
Eating from an ox-cart, singing of white stones.
Tall hat and long sash, crane-feather robe,
I bow deeply to the lords, following Du and Bai.

The swift brilliance of your writing startles me,
Like unhewn jade split from the earth—no trace of axe or chisel.
Dragons sport in the sea’s depths, flashing fang and horn,
Red banners shimmer in hues of crimson and green.
The stele of Hongdu now stands complete,
A thousand chariots crowd the streets and lanes.
Zither and lute find kindred spirits,
Two masters of the art vie in carving and polishing.
I, shamed by fine greens, writhe in stomach-churning envy,
Dare I boast of meat before the butcher’s gate?
Yet Shangqiu’s uncarved jade must not be cast aside—
With adze and knife, let the guiding thread be drawn.
They say a single word is worth a thousand gold,
Yet I lack the brush of Wang Xizhi to lock or seal.
The Old Man of Stone Weir—what greed for treasures!
He demands a hundred thousand coins of yin.
The Master of Guanzhong lives no more,
No midnight gift can repay Wang Mi.
The miser’s chatter grates on all who hear,
Bowing low, sweating, trembling in vain.
The gates of nobles are deep as the sea—no word escapes,
Is it that they deliberately set such harsh limits?
How dare I send a guest-minister as envoy,
To open the Grand Granary and dispense a single grain?
If the shrine should rank first under heaven,
All mouths would speak with one voice of your merit.
Jade and pearls cannot repay you,
I can only wish you a lifespan like the Southern Mountains.
May your descendants restore their beginnings,
And may this deed be woven into the unseen web of fate.

**Song of the Captured Qilin**

They sing of the captured qilin,
Sing of the captured qilin—
The qilin’s name is paired with benevolence.
Its tail like an ox’s, hooves like a horse’s,
Its body sleek, yet one horn stands clear, never harming a soul.
Its voice, now clear, now deep, harmonizes with the pitch-pipes,
Its steps, whether turning or straight, follow the compass and square.
It treads not on living insects, nor travels in herds,
Nor tramples green grass, choosing its dwelling with care.
O benevolent qilin! O wondrous beast!
When this creature appears, the age is at peace.
We thought peace would come in our time,
Yet who could have foreseen that today would fall short of the past?
Falling short of the past—
Strange creatures of bizarre forms now emerge without end.
On Zhangyi’s mountain, crows like cranes,
Called the *Bifang*, born with but a single leg.
Where it appears, fire ravages homes,
So by day they dare not light lamps, by night no candles burn.
Then there is the *Guiche*, the Night-Traveling Ghost!
Ten heads, ten mouths, sharing a single throat.
Its cry like a cartwheel’s creak, its voice hoarse and rasping,
Dripping blood on households, bringing misfortune and woe.
Heaven and Earth endow creatures with their natures—
Why are some born ill-omened, not auspicious?
The world’s fickle passions love and hate,
Hearing good, they rejoice; hearing ill, they rage.
I hear that evil men bring calamity,
None more so than the *Guiche* and *Bifang*.
O benevolent qilin! You are seen no more—
Where are the good men who daily do good?
Good men reap fortune, evil men reap disaster,
For disaster follows excess, fortune follows virtue—this is Heaven’s Way.
King Wu’s grandson met a great merchant,
And when a qilin was captured in the wild, it was deemed ill-fated.
He gave it to the gamekeeper, who asked Confucius,
And Confucius, moved by the qilin, composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.
The *Annals*’ teachings strike the mean,
Yet why did he lay down his brush to end it?
O benevolent qilin! Your time was unkind,
The laying down of the brush—my Way is exhausted.
Confucius has been dead for thousands of years,
The ways of the world are no longer ancient—who laments this?
Good men, evil men—I know not which,
But praise and blame remain in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.
This culture is not yet lost—we seek it in the gods,
Entrusting words to posterity, still admonishing.
Good men do good, and good is encouraged,
Evil men do evil, and evil is punished.
Confucius, the sage—none can compare,
So I lay down my brush and sing of the captured qilin.

---

**Laying Down the Brush: A Song**

Life flits by like a dream in Huaxu,
Restless comings and goings, chasing profit.
Confucius and Mencius are dead, never to rise again—
What has become of the Way of benevolence and righteousness?
The Son of Heaven broke the snake and grasped the Mandate,
Su Qin and Li Yiji mocked the pedantic scholars.
They never read half a line of books,
Yet rode in vermilion wheels and grand carriages, their gates wide.
They boast of their wealth in gold and pearls,
Tossing a million in a single throw, shouting down the gaming tables.
The moon’s spine is gnawed—alas, who sleeps?
Translators babble in foreign tongues, their words garbled.
They pour out wine but do not drink—how foolish their schemes!
Goblins blame their shadows—how stupid they are!
They compose rhapsodies to rival *Zixu*,
Wielding ladles and scrubbing pots, playing the host.
Yang Dafu nearly died after being thrown into prison,
His wit and humor fallen, his integrity lost.
O literature! O literature! How utterly ruined!
Even the starving ghosts clap their hands and jeer.
Thus I know that Gun, drowned in the Feathered Waters,
Was transformed into a dark fish.
Shu’s tiger eyes and pig’s snout—
He died for his greed and corruption.
Yang Shiwo brought disaster to the Yangshe clan,
His mother deaf to the cries of his orphan.
O spirits! O spirits! You who probe the world’s sorrows!
Why cast hexagrams to divine fortune?
Why count bamboo slips at the courtyard’s edge?
Uprightness is virtue—
Why burn pepper and cinnamon in the crucible?
Literature is speech—
Why wield the three-inch tongues of Zhang and Su?
Alas! To know the Way of transformation—
Is to know the workings of the divine.
Have you not seen
Wen Yougong repairing the Jiangzhi Temple,
Dreaming of an omen in Chengdu?
Or Zhong Shiheng bringing the Guangliang to Mianchi,
Using the clapping-hand man as his vanguard?
Have you not seen
Yu Bo compiling the *Soushen Ji*,
Called the Dong Hu of his age?
Who are these men?
Who are these men, who dare dismiss ghosts as nothingness?
The Prefect of Yuzhang, discoursing on the *Spring and Autumn*,
Lost his life.
At Niushijiao, burning rhinoceros horn,
The paths of the seen and unseen diverged.
Enough! Enough!
The brush that captured the qilin is laid down,
I shall speak no more of Yao and Shun.

---

**Ballad of Liangfu**

Black cloth transformed into silk,
An ancient prophecy, all men say.
The stars coil around the Dipper and Ox,
The astrological division belongs to Min-Yue.
To the left, he bows to the Giant Turtle Spirit,
Its peaks and ridges rising like sulfur.
To the right, he bows to Fangshan’s crags,
Its stone walls towering, jagged and sheer.
The tidal waters flow from the Milky Way,
Waxing and waning with the pine and moon.
Once a day it comes to court,
Winding through Jiang and Ke in its circuit.
Huang’s *Sifting Sand Classic*
Reveals sand shaped like bream and mandarin fish.
Then there is Li Boshao,
Whose *Illustrated Classic* depicts rafts of *ning*.
Three peaks stand like a tripod,
Rising abruptly from the flat earth.
Guo’s *Green Satchel Book*
Calls this the cave of the phoenix’s idle perch.
Truly, the art of fengshui is wondrous,
Its spirit soaring, its vitality unbounded.

Men are all Yao and Shun’s folk,
In ancient simplicity, they revered the Buddha’s sigh.
Scholars rose by poetry and books,
Their carriages rolling past scholar trees.
The common folk found peace in farming,
Fields yielding grain like furrows of hares.
Those summoned to the Golden Horse Gate,
Mastered a hundred arts with precision.
At midday markets, merchants thrived,
The Treasury’s great ledgers displayed.
In years of peace, joy abounded,
Spring winds brought boundless delight.

Of late, the present falls short of the past,
Old days now drift like hazy dreams.
The Maker’s craft is truly cunning,
Sun and moon grow ever darker.
No more is heard the *Song of Striking the Earth*,
Only hearts knotted with gloom.
No more the aid of village friends!
Serpents and insects devour each other’s years.
No more loyalty and trust,
Only lawsuits and mutual accusations.
No more benevolence and righteousness,
Only deceit and force in arrogant strife.
No more the whir of looms,
Year’s end brings no cloth or coarse garb.
Bo Yi and Shu Qi died on Shouyang,
No longer gathering bracken and fern.
The House of Fang and Du’s renown has faded,
No more boasting of illustrious lineage.
Confucius and Mencius, old scholars, seem foolish,
Their pure discourse now leans toward aged Buddhas.
Like Han and Chu swayed by slander,
They wither, sighing for Jia and Qu.
Ask why this has come to pass—
The *qi* of fengshui has already waned.
Once mountains stood in embrace,
Now the wind’s path is broken.
Once tidal waters flowed smooth,
Now the tides run dry.
Once pines lined the roads,
Now they are felled and gone.
Once wells gushed with springs,
Now the wells are parched.

Do not say this is fate’s doing—
Yin and yang must not be neglected.
Fengshui is not man’s work,
Save for the wells he digs himself.
How foolish are your words,
While mine brook no hesitation.
Where there is decay, there is renewal,
Where there is ruin, there is flourishing.
Mountains and waters remain mountains and waters,
Men remain men.
Is literature not precious?
The nobleman’s virtue will yet shine like the leopard’s spots.
Farming must seize the season,
Rain and seedlings burst with life.
Tao Zhu’s wealth spanned the realm,
His diligence reaped even the finest profit.
A humble craft surpasses fertile fields,
Year-round toil must stand firm.
I urge you: shun idleness,
Lest like a horse you lose the bit’s restraint.
I urge you: do no wrong,
For the law’s blade cuts deep.
I urge you: crave not excess,
Lest reckless acts mar your face and eyes.
I urge you: drink no wine,
Lest drunkenness lead you to ruin.
I urge you: deceive not your heart,
For heaven punishes deceit.
I urge you: do good deeds,
Good deeds nurture orchids and irises.
Behold Lingji Temple,
Where benefactors’ names are carved in sandalwood.
A village hails its virtuous men,
Their fame enduring through ten thousand ages.
My words are bitter as medicine,
Engrave them in your heart like a stele.

**Rejoicing in Rain**
Nine wheels blaze like scorching fire,
Mountains and rivers washed clean, seedlings withered.
The farmer’s back drips sweat in bitter toil,
Gazing endlessly for clouds, his eyes parched.
No more tales of cutting melons or severing hair,
Who now would pray to the mulberry groves for the people?

Blazing crowns, scorching arms—offerings of heart’s incense,
Yet still we hope heaven’s heart may relent from calamity.
The seals on rivers and lakes are too stern,
The Six Dings dare not unlock the golden locks.
The stele of the Sacred Dragon’s traces still stands,
Yet idle talk claims Old Dragon of Biefeng is senile.

Alas, how the customs of the age twist and turn,
Outward guise shifts in an instant, the heart already follows.
Wu Ridge exhorts the phoenix to soar to Tian Mountain,
Its cliff paths treacherous and slick—few tread there.
This rain at this hour is but chance,
Yet how could neighbors not have sought it sooner?

Addition and subtraction follow fate, fate follows heaven,
The formless image soars high and boundless.
The Master of the Eastern Sea blazes with divine power,
Having revealed heaven’s secrets to make them plain to you.
The sun sets on Western Mountain, idle words arise,
The prophecy of *xu* and *wu* is profoundly obscure.

These words are a contract that does not deceive me,
Gazing up to the radiant spirit as if it stood at my left.
If indeed the earth gods bring forth abundance,
A single drop from heaven’s gourd will overturn.
Then fields will be rich and drenched,
White-haired elders and yellow-haired children dance as one.
Loins ache from reaping the ripe harvest, joyous in the year’s plenty,
Slaughtering chickens to prepare for tasting the new rice.

The people never forget to offer thanks,
Presenting stream-grown ferns and pondweeds in tribute.
How dare the gods claim credit for themselves?
They but repay heaven’s grace with rain and celebration.

*Xielin’s* judgment on the incense missive:
Tales of ghosts and spirits—what are they but emptiness?
Soundless, formless, fundamentally void.
Idols of clay and wood are no true sages—
Ask them the dipper’s handle, and they know not east from west.

Outside the gate, the sound of carving and chiseling—
Who would know a guest has come?
Kong Rong sat and gazed upon the divine bones of purple jade,
His breast untrammled, his qi swallowing the rainbow.
Passed down to the master, the pearls strung with art,
Their pure light piercing the slumber of the black dragon.
Obtaining such marvels, astonishment and joy,
Nodding in silent dread, lips pressed in anxious muttering.
Ziqi is dead and will not live again—
Who now can distinguish *shang* from *gong*?
Forced to stitch and patch, losing the path’s tread,
Better to embrace silence, equal to the blind and deaf.

I know this visit bears some intent—
These few pages are no mere answer to a goose cage.
Face flushed, back damp with sweat, how dare I leave?
With eyes of broad vision, I contain seas and rivers.
The master strides forth, lifting the veil for me,
Well-versed in the Five Classics and the masters’ histories.

I recall my youth in Chang’an,
Golden seals and starry sashes gleaming at my waist.
Looking back, worldly affairs are but fleeting echoes,
Leaving me alone to drive joy to its end.
The scholar’s cap and robe ill suit Yue’s ways—
Now nine in ten chase the southern wind.
How many rich and mighty have fallen in reversal?
The customs of Wuling’s earth differ from old.
Xi and E race on, never pausing—
Suddenly, beard and temples are snow and tumbleweed.

How to seek joy in mountains and waters?
From my sleeve, I draw the green satchel to visit Master Zheng.
Recognize this inch of ground for what it will be,
Entrust it to sons and grandsons to learn the old farmer’s ways.

*Inscription for Secretary Lin’s Stele*
Ugly mouths lost their governance,
The Five Dynasties contended in might.
The four seas seethed like a boiling cauldron,
The Central Plains grew wild with mugwort and wormwood.
At fifteen, I studied books and histories;
At twenty, I took up shield and spear.
Leading troops by the hundreds of thousands,
I spurred my horse across the Huai River.
The imperial archives honored my commission,
Leaving me to guard the banner’s sway.
The people of Huai welcomed me with laughter,
Men plowing, women weaving in song.

In the *Kaiyun* era, I entered southern Min,
Daring not to violate even a hair.
South of the gorges, the road was lined with green cloth,
Towering peaks like giant turtles.
The temple’s image stood beside the true,
Lofty, rooted in the mountain’s curve.
The dragon’s head received its due worship,
That year named *Zhenghe*.
The people diligently offered thanks,
Presenting stream and marsh’s bounty.

Four hundred years have passed,
Yet the path remains free of wind and wave.
Resplendent, the spirit’s power shines forth—
How numerous the events recorded!
But tongues grow stiff with age,
Each word awry and errant.
Drawing a tiger, they make a dog—
The clamor of many mouths is but noise.
Poetry and books lie bound on high shelves,
Later scholars lose the way of Qiu and Ke.

I hear of your righteous talent,
These pages exchanged for a white goose.
Your writing crowns the age,
Words flowing like a hanging river.
Your brush’s array sweeps a thousand armies,
Seal script and clerical forms sharp as awls.
Silver hooks like phoenix wings in flight,
Iron strokes like dragons coiling and gliding.
Carving stone to make a stele,
At your touch, it becomes a lesson struck.
My deeds and your name,
Will endure unblemished through the ages.

*To the Recluse of South Village*
The Recluse of South Village,
Renowned for poetry by rivers and seas for years now,
Suddenly arose with verses of return—
His mother dead, unburied, he could not bear to leave Lu in sorrow,
So took refuge on Deer Mountain,
Humbly arranging her funeral.

One day, he came to me with incense in his sleeve,
And I borrowed an ancient line to compose a quatrain to encourage him.
He further honored me with *Fox-Fur and Jade-Fish*, his *Yu Yan Collection*,
Its pages ablaze before my eyes.
With respect, I followed the rhymes within,
Matching them as best I could.
This rough offering is but a moment’s gift—
How could it deserve to be cast in metal?

Lest one mistake purple for vermilion—how dare I presume kinship with the ranks of extraordinary men and lofty scholars? Yet I have been honored with prefaces and postscripts, their praise so excessive it verges on mimicry. Thus, I append twenty-two verses in the ancient and modern styles of Master Thatched-Hut, humbly attaching them after the preface to *Fox-Fur*, a small token of gratitude. Heh heh.

The daylily withered long ago,
The Meng-mother’s neighbor lies in weeds.
Alas, in the void of the grave’s silence,
Loneliness soaks my robes and kerchief.
A thousand gold gifts for the traveler’s road,
Yet the demands of foreign customs leave one poor.
Now my temples are streaked with gray,
The candle dims, and my painted brows fade.
I sketch the lands I’ve traversed on the ground—
Homeless, I must bear this aging frame.
The high heavens’ intent is mournful,
For you, my nose stings with sorrow.

By nature I follow Kāśyapa,
Singing as I walk—not truly a hermit.
I call to the mountains, but no deer stays,
Leaning on my staff, I follow others.
The clay scholar transmits divine words,
Yet my gate and courtyard fear frequent guests.
This floating world has its fixed fate—
How much more so for me, lost in barbarian dust?

Hoisting sail beneath the Southern Dipper,
I gaze at the North Star from a perilous tower.
The balmy wind moves in accord with the seasons,
The vast sea stretches without a ford.
Like a bear in fellowship, I suffer disdain,
Yet my empty heart endures bending and stretching.
I urge you: cease your sighs of regret,
For meeting me fulfills a long-held kinship.

My writings wear thin with revision,
Yet I cherish the honor of your fine mats.
I gladly mingle with the misty haze,
Envious of the painted qilin’s pair.
Wang Di’s legacy should be true,
Chu Suiliang’s calligraphy is peerless.
Gao and Cen walk at a measured pace,
Geng and Jia are also revered ministers.
The dense bamboo laughs in winter,
A faint fragrance borrows from the islet’s duckweed.
In pure discourse, one tastes its savor,
Yet sidelong glances pain the spirit.

A clear mirror hung brings weariness,
Thoughts stir like fish in a dried-up pool.
Late, I ponder the author’s intent—
Again, he takes things to be spring.
The morning’s breath admires those with purpose,
Knowing my laziness is genuine.
Like Xu Ruzi, I am honored,
Our meetings ever renewed.

*Imitating Zhou’s "Lotus City"*
Where do Xi and E race in their chariots?
They say the crimson elder knows no age.
You, sir, grew weary of the world and ascended as an immortal—
Who will pity my misfortune, left behind?
I raise my face to heaven and wail, tears streaming,
Body stiff, spirit lost, as if near death.
When the coffin lid is sealed, weariness craves rest,
Yet lotus after lotus is no dream—my eyes see clearly.

Your countenance smiles as if alive,
The moon’s beauty shines down, illuminating the rafters.
Crane-capped and crane-cloaked, you ride a dragon’s plow,
Ahead, a cicada-chariot; behind, a team of four.
Left banners, right standards, dancing pennants,
Empty songs and grand music fill the air.
Pine and willow line the lane, yet it sits in a bustling market,
Winding paths diverge north and south.
Who carved the stone wall’s inscriptions?
Oyster-shell phoenixes leap and flutter in hooked strokes.
To the west, the Hall of Western Restraint stands on one side,
To the east, the Hall of True Unity belongs to the Great Mystery.
On the hall’s stars hang lanterns like ten thousand *hu* of lotuses,
Exotic fragrances overpower dragon’s spittle.
Asking those nearby, the matter is clear—
They point: this place is called the Heavenly Hook.

Once, its master was but Yu Quan,
Now the age must find a successor—not just any man.
You, sir, were called a worthy of the world,
Meeting across a thousand kalpas, good causes intertwined.
From Yan’s lineage, you received jade texts,
Seeking the hidden, you grasped the true essence.
Rain and dew moisten even the Nine Springs,
Your fasts and rituals shine with clarity.
When the tally of merit and deeds reached three thousand,
Your name was inscribed on jade tablets by the flaming pearl’s shore.
Unwilling to take your place, you delayed,
The Emperor said: such matters have their constants and flexibilities.

The joys of heaven’s music are also fitting—
Why look back and hesitate further?
Each person wears pearl-studded slippers and sable caps,
Their hairpins and sashes, their immortal robes, more radiant still.
In the eastern and western wings, ranks align,
Coming and going like drifting wind and mist.
Bowing and receiving with reverent ceremony,
Their fame, culture, and splendor fill the four seats.

In life, you did not vie with things for beauty,
Yet before death, you ascended in an instant.
Your son, clad in [missing character], will hold the whip,
The heavenly steps rise sheer to their towering peak.
Sixty warriors clad in armor,
Their might and fury wild and boundless.
One sees only their fur bristling, shoulders trembling,
Souls and dreams flying away and returning.
The tale of the plantain deer is indeed true—
The gulf between the hidden and the manifest is as vast as heaven and abyss.

What has passed flows like a river,
Faint as a battle’s flank, yet my worries burn.
Unable to fulfill filial duty to the end,
I must cast aside this body in grief.
The tale of Lotus City is told in the world—
I wish to follow Su Shi and continue its legacy.
Yet the affairs of mourning and life’s entanglements press,
My laughter fades, my voice grows hoarse—I cannot match its elegance.

I do not delight in jest or mockery,
But wish to show later generations what is so.
Your plot of land is level and smooth,
Planted with melons and willows, may they flourish.
I firmly believe the Way of Heaven is straight as a bowstring,
Yet you received the Emperor’s favor, singular and devoted.
Desires approach—you heard them first,
To prosper your descendants and glorify your ancestors.
Your family’s caps and sashes fill the gates,
Soon, the old possessions will return to the green felt.
Admiring your virtue, I emulate Shen and Qian,
Do not betray your mother’s steadfast will—do not err.
Dedicate yourself to books and history, strive with diligence,
Avoid other pursuits, do not favor pipes and strings.

Your grand deeds are a true field of blessing,
Your family’s legacy flows like an unceasing stream.
A great mansion’s support is not just eight hundred bushels,
Under Xi’s shelter, joy and safety abound.
Always remember to offer sacrifices, advance the rituals,
To perpetuate the family’s affairs with diligence.
Your dream’s emotions are entwined,
What you saw was not inverted or confused.
It aligns like lotus roots and stems,
Every sign and omen confirms it.

The Creator speaks not, yet subtly turns the wheel,
Revealing your virtue for all to see.
I record these events, inscribing them on bamboo,
Though onlookers shrink back, fearing involvement.

*For Lord Lin of East Village*
King Zhou’s cruelty married the woman of Su,
The man from the Eastern Sea fished at Ox Mountain.
The First Emperor’s wrath burned his books,
The tragedy of Xinggu was a crime deserved.
Zhengze wandered far from women,
Wishing to join Peng Xian in daily joy.
Ziyipi of Zhu was called Tao Zhu,
Why did he take a small boat and float on the Five Lakes?

Essence and qi drowned, marrow dried,
Blind, deaf, mute—content in self-delusion.
The traces of steering are ever halting,
The sounds of crooning—what do they sing?
The Nine Wrappings no longer rest on tall catalpas,
Crying at night, hiding by day—tamed like a fox.

Alas, the customs of the age weave autumn’s thoroughwort,
Beneath the grass lie river fences and coarse-woven carts.
The Heavenly Ladder and Stone Ramparts are called perilous paths—
Yet compared to the world’s roads, they are but rugged trails.
The Bohai’s great abyss is named the Returning Void—
Yet beside the River of Desire, it is but filth and greed.
Once, scholars rich in learning burrowed like thieves,
Zealously chasing profit, guarding their hoards.
Smoothly they feign deceit, panting with flattery,
Their cunning and baseness ensnaring even the wise.
Emperors, kings, hegemons—each age differs,
No leisure for bows and courtesies like Yao and Shun.
Above, the universe; below, the cosmos—a single tendril,
From ancient past to present, but a fleeting moment.
Ten thousand fireflies scatter at dusk into the great void,
Dawn’s tangled threads race past like a colt through a crack.
Who fathoms the vast spirit’s primordial beginning?
The land of Wang Mang guards its sealed borders.
The Yellow Dragon bears forth the Five-Colored Chart,
The divine tortoise’s eight trigrams reveal heaven’s pivot.
Ancient texts and relics are no falsehood—
Cease prattling of Zhuangzi and Laozi as mere emptiness.
For over four hundred years, offerings have filled the temple,
Once bearing the imperial staff to govern Jiangdu.
The auspicious decree of Jiaxi’s reign brought blessed rain,
The sacred honor of Lingji’s enfeoffment shone in the village.
Of late, the shrine lay desolate and overgrown,
Now rebuilt on a grand scale.
I compose this stele text, casting a pearl into darkness—
Who will bear its weight and lend it praise?
Like you, a master strategist hailed as a great scholar,
Your integrity and resolve illuminate the nine regions.
Your words and brush lead the vanguard,
Stripping the Three Armies of their courage, routing Xihao.
The jade script gleams resplendent, unfurling its brilliance—
Yet who hesitates to beg for inscriptions and records?
Two letters sent, no reply—what then?
Even speech falters, lips stammering.
Only your sacred virtue matches the earth’s vastness,
I, Xu, recount these deeds in words.

**Answering Questions on Tomb Construction**
The old graves of Beimang stretch endlessly,
City and capital’s wealth promised for a thousand years.
Tombstones carve names as large as bushels—
Ask their descendants: who remains?
Auspicious and ominous signs were divined in those years,
Yet fate’s reversals—what was their purpose?
Fortune and misfortune have no gate; man summons them himself,
The heart’s core is the foundation of blessing.
Alas, the world’s people are foolish and deluded,
Why must great families erect fences between them?
Do they not recall the ghosts of shared ancestry?
How much more so for those bound as branches intertwined.
Where now is the rise and fall of royal mausoleums?
To bury a mother and be called a filial son—how could one bear it?
Have you not seen:
The imperial qi of Jinling once flourished,
Yet the Qin sought to suppress it.
The palace bore Wu Zetian,
And Gaozong was not unaware.
If even the state fares thus,
Why doubt the ways of men?
To dig graves and burn corpses is no noble virtue—
What you would not desire, do not impose on others.
Both families harbor hidden deeds,
But above, the gods cannot be deceived.

**Answering Zhou Shiyu’s Questions on Affairs**
South to Yue, north to the Hu,
West into Qin, east into Wu—
All are heroes, true men.
Setting forth on winding roads,
Bow of fleabane in hand, mulberry arrows at the waist.
The flowers of Heyang bloom in splendor,
Let me ride my donkey as I please.
In life, friendships know no age,
Bound by affection as thick as creeping grass.
Once there were Chen and Lei,
Now there are Huang and Su.
Your heart and mine align—
Why consult the shamans of Yue?

Now the path is smooth and wide,
A single meal of fine vegetables brings contentment.
The two words "peace and safety" gladden a family letter.

**Answering Master Lü’s Questions on Horses and Rice**
The old man of Gechuan, Wang Fangping,
Passed through Dongwu to visit Cai Jing.
The people saw no immortal’s form,
Only heard the sound of carriages and horses in the void.
Golden platters and jade cups arrayed eight delicacies,
As the wine waned, cloud-borne sheng music played.
In an instant, riding the wind with jade pendants raised,
Tiger-drawn and dragon-borne chariots sped to the purple heavens.
He left me a scroll called *The Yellow Court*,
Cinnabar that was once rice transformed.
Five colors dazzle the eye, radiant and bright,
Yet in the realm of immortals, sun and moon never tarry.
The sea’s waters shallowed, stirring dust,
While the men of Baxian barked at the orange-dwellers.
Why do worldly folk vie in rivalry?
Shorn hair and yellowed foreheads—what are they for?
Hurriedly chasing wins and losses in reckless gambling.
Have you not seen:
In the dark sea, dates grow large as melons,
On Ying Mountain, plums swell like jars.
How does the joy of the orange’s midst compare?
Feast on dates and plums—
They can preserve long life.

**Encouraging the Painter Cai**
They say the Cai family excels in painting,
A tiger-headed general reborn.
Fine or coarse, good or ill—all have their standards,
Capturing spirit and qi with truth.
Last year on the Double Ninth, you came to visit,
Painting elite soldiers and spirits in their forms.
Mighty warriors with great feathered arrows at their waists,
Their bristling hair and whiskers striking awe.
To east and west, the stars of fortune and eminence,
Each stroke and dot brimming with vitality.
The court teems with scholars in crimson and purple—
Now I believe the scholar’s cap does not deceive.
Above, you paint perfected beings attending the imperial palace,
Their light clinging to sun, moon, and stars.
Below, you spread rain and dispel thunder,
Personally bearing the emperor’s decree to bless the living.
Returning to your grotto, you play immortal music,
Sleeves scented with the faint fragrance of the imperial censer.
On either side, jade balustrades emerge,
Silver hooks hang high, crimson curtains drawn.
The *Liupo* melody dances with slender waists,
A hundred amusements jest with wit and charm.
Only the bedchamber’s painting remains unfinished—
I know your skilled hand values brush and silk.
You cannot leave, you cannot leave,
Painters like you are rare indeed.
Year after year, year after year,
All say a steadfast heart can pierce stone.
Wind and moon cost no coin,
Every sip and bite is predestined.
Yet they say only the Xu family’s son,
Unaware that peach and cassia are immortals.
Last year’s song left meaning unexpressed,
Now I compose this ancient poem to urge the traveler.

**Answering a Student’s Questions on Eye Ailments**
They say the five aggregates are all thieves—
Who would claim Heaven is cautious with the whites of eyes?
Better to gouge and hang them at my gate,
Than mimic the frown of one who boasts of purple stone.
Fu Sheng’s debt of books remains unpaid,
Yet even Zhu Xin and King Liu left Kong’s estate.
Rooted in sorrow for the Dao, not for poverty—
Why then do pearl-like tears fall from my lashes?
A boat’s itch cannot be scratched,
Of late, red and festering, dim and blurred.
I shame myself for wit not what it was,
My spirit withered, sinking into delusion.
Before the lamp, flames flicker, halos bloom,
Hair sparse, yellow and green—where is the jade-like blue?

Where do the returning geese point their homeward flight?
Fortunate to know east from west, south from north.
Bright moon, brain-bladder—blame the toad’s webbed sin,
Yet who dusts the terrace mirror’s grime?

Before and after me, how many Hua Tuos?
Gold needles, medicinal dots, wheat-grain acupuncture.
Is this not a deep-seated malady sinking into the vital organs?
Why then does the skin remain stubbornly impervious?

"Subtract two from seven"—what foul talk!
Laughable, these talisman-scribes wielding brush and blade.
Wu Cheng is dead and will not revive—
Fortune and misfortune, blessings and calamities, who can fathom their schemes?

I reckon your heart ever open and unburdened,
Never say this old man’s fate is thin.
Trace the cause—who bears the fault?
I call myself a book-madman, a transmission-obsessive.

Why not suspend your topknot and pierce your flesh more sharply?
Year after year, nine nines exhaust my thoughts and strength.
The blue-robed servant neglects his duty—
One night, the west wind stirs the pebbles.

Leaves wither, their cure harsher than winter’s bite,
The mountain-forest resolve now broken in dreams.
Ask Shu He the reason—
Beneath my fingers, the *ri guan* pulse.

Faint, weak, floating, scattered—how can one know?
The six excesses unregulated, qi clashing in rebellion.
I am no companion of Yu Ling’s peers,
How would I recognize Li’s three palatable bites?

I hear the divine fire turns the great potter’s wheel,
Song Yangli’s son holds the wondrous formula.
Vast and obscure, fundamentally wordless—
Yet let us try to gather words and lift them up.

Bear-gall ointment for blindness, from the *Zhou Hou*,
I entrust it to you, sir, to assuage my duty.
Your reputation resounds across the four seas—
I wish to seek a single word as my mouth’s sustenance.

**Inscription Requested by Dong Village Elder**
The spirit has a record—since receiving the seal and cover,
I am asked for an inscription to extol its virtues and fulfill its aspirations.
It must match Sun Chuo’s prose,
Then be carved in stone, preserving the ancient style of thirty-eight lines,
From one to ten, then ten back to one.
Stele, record.
The spirit is rather extraordinary.
Not for fame, merely to narrate the events.
Though pleased to appraise, I am especially grateful not to be spurned.

It receives blood offerings in this region,
Its name heard across the Five Dynasties.
Beginning in the Kaiyun Jiachen year,
Now the Zhiyuan Gui Si year.
Eight thousand valiant riders comfort the people of Min,
Over four hundred years, the temple stands on this ground.
Wisdom, brightness, uprightness—only virtue is fragrant,
Fortune and misfortune, blessings and calamities, are brought about by human deeds.

Alas! The world’s path is harder than Shu’s roads to heaven,
Why trouble with books when the Han king vies in cunning?
Silk-traders, dog-butchers, the clamorous Fan and Cao, Guan and Ying,
Presenting memorials and phoenix odes, the mediocre Dong Zhongshu and Jia Yi.

Ancestral deceit prevails, neighbors like carved jade bound together,
Wolfish greed and cruel excess—above and below, all vie for profit.
The world has no constant worthies, a single classic outweighs gold,
Who discerns the eight characters on the reverse of the Cao E stele?

You, sir, inherit a transmitted learning,
Like the reverent attendant minister, your twin in virtue.
Having received your iron strokes and silver hooks,
I must now craft ornate prose and brocade thoughts.

The shrine’s composition, Jiang Du’s writings,
The temple’s *Luochi Record*.
Truly peerless in talent,
The seal script surpasses all four styles.

Borrowing another’s voice to express my own intent,
There is a request—to seek shelter, sincerity, shame.
**Seeing You Off**
Wrong, wrong, wrong—why sing of the petty?
Wrong, wrong—yet not truly wrong,
Alas, the world’s ways are so thin and cruel.

Do not say the lychee’s branches glow red,
Or that the golden crow pecks the dawn’s spittle.
A thousand-household lord may well boast,
Dancing in a vat, laughing in self-delight.

The Feng Cheng sword, the Kunshan jade—
Such words today are mere empty gestures.
Is it that Zhan Yin’s divination fails me,
Or that Hu Gong is foolish, and I with rotten rope?

Wrong, wrong, wrong—why sing of the petty?
Wrong, wrong—yet not truly wrong.
This year at Nian Shoal,
Next year, the name becomes *E* (calamity).

Thunder rumbles, the sky’s drum resounds,
The outer dragon stirs, sprouting horns.
The four seas’ teeming masses await the life-giving rain,
Leap straight into the heavenly pond!

Do not say the years have been bitterly hard,
Birds startled in crooked trees, fish harmed by bait,
Like the cold tortoise withdrawing its head into its shell.
Have you not seen the diligent farmer,
Toiling through spring plowing and summer sowing, hoping for autumn’s harvest?

Worldly affairs are all thus—
With a heart as firm as stone, even it can be chiseled.
Wrong, wrong, wrong—why sing of the petty?
Wrong, wrong—yet not truly wrong.

I send this word to the hermit of Shu Villa:
Linzi is not the deer beneath the plantain.
Huan Tan vehemently argued against prognostication’s unreliability—
Who knew one arrow would truly strike the autumn parrot?

What day is today?
I instruct you to pass the seventh month’s first day.
What day is the next?
The second day of the tenth month, as divined, is auspicious.

The wind howls,
The horse hesitates.
The road is long and pressing,
The carriage’s wheels gleam.

Shouldering your load, stepping high, you ask again—
How many more miles to Qingyuan?
The customs differ, the land vast, the sea boundless,
Here, peaks and ridges stand tall.

The people are sparse, the smoke faint,
In the quiet lies the ancient double-walled city.
The county magistrate’s crossbowmen lead the way,
Foreign merchants and Hu traders follow in succession.

Moonlit pearl waters, granary jade brimming red,
Precious treasures, gold-threaded nets.
Coral and green trees, two feet tall,
Plus eight hundred *hu* of black pepper.

The customs checkpoint has its regulations,
Public levies and private monopolies.
What is gained is so abundant—
Felt bundles, woven mats, loaded on donkeys and camels.

I pray you, do not forget the old neighbor,
Return and share with me a single ladle.
Wrong, wrong, wrong—why sing of the petty?
Now, more than ever, hold fast.

The evening game board’s situation is most perilous,
This move is decisive—one step determines all.
Do not squander your journey,
This piece is played for you.

The forerunner awakens the latecomers,
You few, Chen’s strategy.
The bow and arrow aim in all four directions—
Who would fill the ditches?

Wealth and honor do not lie in heaven,
Self-reliance stands on its own.
Exhort one another earnestly—
Wrong is not truly wrong.

**A Jest, Laughable**
Laughable, laughable,
Do not overlook the subtle.
Investigating things to extend knowledge—
The *Great Learning*’s essence.

Naturally, so naturally,
The wondrous workings of spirit and brightness.
Unknowing, unperceiving,
Vast and obscure.

Words do not attest to me,
Deeds may be mocked.
Fortune and misfortune have no gate,
Only humans summon them.

With your talents, sir,
Your fame shines resplendent.

As with your aspirations—mountain forests, the taste of whistling winds,
Inscribing pillars like Sima Xiangru, restoring temples in Chengdu.
Who is that man? His ambitions are no small matter.
To emulate Yan Hui is still to be Yan—who would call you unworthy?
Yet your schemes today—how narrow your gaze.
If you do not act now, days and months will spin ever farther.
Old age approaches—do not say you are still young.
To abandon yourself, to cast yourself away,
Is to willingly become beast of burden.

My words flow like a spring—your nature already understands.
I gather these rustic sayings—truly, they are laughable.

**Answering Questions**

Gates upon gates,
Pine-locked, sealed tight.
I ask the master—
Is he in the west, not bound to the east?
Stay awhile, sir,
The message lingers in the passage.
Tomorrow, magpies’ cries will brim with joy,
And this day, we meet again.

My temples are not yet wild with age,
"Peace and safety"—these two words
Are my family’s creed.
How can I bear this hazy moonlight,
Seeing Chang’e call her maiden?
Double-Bloom, surnamed Dong,
Queen Mother soaring in the void.
Now, good fortune arrives—
Brows unfurrow, a touch of red.

**Answering Questions on Livelihood**

To seek wealth from poverty—
I ask: by what means?
The elder Lü sold grease, Zhang peddled wine,
The Na and Zhuo clans, Qi, Dun, Zhou, and Yang.
Such are these ranks—
Each takes up their strength.
Bustling, teeming,
The marketplace of profit.
As the ancients said:
Craftsmen cannot compare to merchants.

**Answering Chen Nou’s Inquiry on Official Service**

Fish transform into dragons—
The news from Yu’s Gate draws near.

Thunder roars, shaking a hundred leagues,
Now rain is ample, farmers rise to toil.
I ask the village ahead, wrapped in snow’s embrace—
I hear the cuckoo’s urgent, ceaseless call.

Seize the hour, and the Dragon will rejoice,
The Dragon will rejoice—once more, peach and plum bloom anew.
Clouds part, rain clears,
Swallows carry mud in their beaks.
Speaking of wealth and nobility, the scions of kings and lords,
They return from spring’s revels.
Vying in finery, silks and satins, pure and soft,
Not to mention mounds of yellow gold.
Gold fills the hollow—
Fan Li of Tao was once Zhu of Yi, who changed his name and returned to his homeland.
At Qi’s gate, he played the zither, unrecognized in his time,
Looking back, the minister’s seal was but a worn-out tray.
A worn-out tray—
Human life is but a butterfly’s dream, fluttering and fleeting,
I urge you: time is just this brief.
But preserve this square inch of ground,
And entrust it to your descendants as their foundation.
Five, six, seven—these numbers
Mark the finest prospects ahead.

**To the One Commissioning an Inscription**

Though the spirit is upright and not demonic,
In dark, desolate chambers, I sit ashamed of undeserved favor.
Though true talent exists for great use,
I, a rotten tree, am unworthy of carving.
Yet with bundles of silk and scallions, you show respect,
And with a generous verse, you vie for the prize.
A hundred generations will flourish—all thanks to ancestral virtue,
In time, the phoenix will surely sing in the court.

**Thanking Magistrate Lin for Inscribing the Stele**

On the ancient plain, a ruined temple sighs over its mounds,
Its lineage traced back to the Xu clan.
Heroes grow old, as worthless as dust,
Who now understands the classics and their profound meaning?
Though I cannot match Han Yu’s records,
I am glad to write like Liu Zongyuan.
Ashamed I lack five hundred taels of gold for the brush’s reward,
Yet the spirit, in hidden favor, knows me well.

**Farewell to Painter Cai**

A master’s brush brings forth art from nature,
Gu Kaizhi and Yan Liben inherited its transmission.
Though the craftsman’s skill is prized, the brush may seem clumsy,
The pigments deep and rich, the colors all the more vivid.
On the wall, his name endures for ten thousand ages,
Among men, his fame spreads to three thousand guests.
Now, as we part, I am filled with sorrow—
A humble cup of wine, a poem to send him off.

**Four Daoist Masters Manifest at the Altar’s Construction**

Four immortals descend to the luminous altar,
Pity those who see with different eyes.
Clad in gourds, they laugh with open mouths,
Holding bats, they step through wide-open gates.
Their cloud-like hearts lightly come and go,
A thousand-year iron pillar stands, ancient and mottled.
If you ask where I dwell,
I am beyond Penglai’s outer mountains.

**To the Old Almsgatherer of the Heavenly King, Whose Request Went Unfulfilled**

Such contempt is but the work of power’s sway,
Though the spirit descended, it curled up in reluctance.
I know well the barriers between Qin and Yue,
How can there be the steadfast bond of Chen and Lei?
Empty formalities in four-six prose, sealing jars of sauce,
Repeated auspicious divinations waste feasts and efforts.
Cease your weary thoughts of longing for me,
Go instead to the mountains and drink from the stone spring.

**Three Answers on Affairs**

Those who beg for minor blessings exist,
Yet those who exert effort and offer wealth find no cause.
Emperor Wu mocked those who gave themselves to the Buddha,
Deceitful hearts still practice the ways of the Man and Min.
Do not say planting blessings bears no seed—
I fear this fleeting body will turn to dust.
Swift as a galloping steed, human life passes in an instant,
How pitiable—Zhao Meng, ever earnest in his advice.

In stillness, I laugh at the world’s people,
Who know not the causes of past and future lives.
All are but karmic shrines from the Jin of Shi,
Who knew they once belonged to the kingdom of Min?
Wealth and nobility, ten thousand kinds, vanish like dreams,
How many heroes have already turned to dust?
Diligently practice deeds of kindness,
No need for more earnest words.

The spirit’s manifest power lies in man,
Or perhaps not—heaven has no cause.
A single heroic soul swallows the cosmos,
A thousand ancient temples adorn Min and Ou.
The western stele remains unerected, its record left empty,
The inner walls are still stained with dust.
To begin and complete is the work of a noble man,
Why need the transforming brush to urge you further?

**Answering the Liang Clan’s Inquiry on Reburial**

The ox sleeps where Tao Gong divined the grave,
A white crane immortal briefly descends to the mortal realm.
The heart’s sincerity matches the yin earth’s goodness,
How dare I claim heaven’s favor is mine alone?
If indeed the ancestors’ spirits are present,
They will see your descendants rise to high office.
Offer a peach in return for jade,
All comes from the Creator, who knows repayment.

**To Judge of the Shanglin Prefecture, in the Style of Cao E**

Without your command, the characters were not complete,
Yet in my sleeve, I knew them from crossing great rivers.
Village songs and roadside chants linger like swift horses,
The two sweet pear trees recall the renowned worthy.
Ten marvels of the precious hall—

**Golden Turtle Peak**
Once it bore the square Penglai from the sea,
Here it coils, never to return.
A thousand years have divined its divine splendor,
Ashamed I lack the eight-pillar talent to hold up the sky.

**Literary Brush Peak**
Its solitary crest soars into the vast, empty void,
Its distant form seems to pierce the heavens like a bookshelf.
This land has long produced officials and scholars,
The earth’s vital qi breeds literary heroes.

**Greedy Wolf Peak**
Among the seven stars of the Dipper, it shines with literary brilliance,
How did this mountain rise so tall from the earth?
I long to soar to its highest summit,
To forever join the earth’s tongue in aiding peace.

**Lotus Peak**
Jade-like flowers display their artistry, distant and graceful,
The Buddha’s hair emits a subtle fragrance, drifting into the mysterious.
If only a heavenly wind could carry a single leaf,
It too would drift eastward with Taiyi.

**Square Rock Peak**
A stone fan opens into the empty sky,
Its scenery surpasses Penglai.
At times, when the azure heavens descend to pay homage,
The wind’s axle briefly rests on green moss.

**White Deer Peak**
How many years have passed since the white deer came?
The perilous peak still leans against the blue sky.
In leisure, not only do I discuss true secrets,
I also seek a forest monk to ask about Chan.

**Ancient City Peak**
Layered summits, emerald hues shrouded in verdure,
The ancient ramparts have no foundation, yet the gaze never ends.
At midnight, under the bright moon, the heavens’ music resounds,
I suspect a crane has returned from the distant east.

**Flying Tumbleweed Peak**
A tumbleweed flies from the sea,
Cinnabar cliffs and emerald walls stand tall in the distance.
Where now is the immortal who played the sheng?
Only peach trees, a thousand in bloom, remain.

**Purple Terrace Peak**
The terrace peak juts out east of the Yue River,
A winding path of black and purple threads through the verdant hues.
How many times has the bright moon seen immortals descend?
Their coral pendants tinkle in the celestial wind.

**Great Peace Peak**
The benevolent winds of a bright age spread great peace,
How fortunate this mountain is to bear such a fine name.
Several times I have climbed to its summit to gaze,
The six directions stretch boundlessly, heaven and earth clear.

**Eight Poems on True Immortals**

**Palace of the Turtle Peak Immortal**
From the sea, the peak surges forth like a golden turtle,
A dark palace stands, firmly constructed.

**The Eternal Heroic Spirit**
The heroic spirit never fades,
Its earthly station lofty and pure.
By moonlight, the cinnabar well lies deep;
In spring winds, the green peach blossoms bloom.
A single loyalty upholds the realm,
A crimson edict bestows honor and praise.

**Dragon Pool Flying Waterfall**
A thousand-foot dragon’s maw—no ladder may scale,
A flying torrent plunges straight down in rainbow spray.
The immortals, late returning from gathering essences,
Idly play with murmuring streams and medicinal mud.

**Bamboo Cliff After Snow**
The sacred cliff retains its auspicious snow,
Dawn’s light now brightens the clearing sky.
Piled whiteness cradles the first rays,
Frozen splendor gleams in the Great Clarity.
Low, it buries the bent bamboo;
High, it crushes the ancient pine.
I long to soar to the perilous summit,
Strolling at leisure in a crane-feather cloak.

**Immortal Isle’s Sacred Fungus**
Dazzling, resplendent—threefold blossoms flourish,
The harmonious qi of the Great Peace nurtures this spiritual root.
Dwelling hidden here, how to repay its grace?
Plucked and offered to Yu Yan, presented to the Supreme Lord.

**Returning Tide at Green Bank**
At the farthest bank, the cold tide recedes,
Winding and distant, the view stretches wide.
Grass roots cling to scattered stones,
The river’s mouth reveals level sands.
Birds peck at the broken green mud,
Boats moor to ancient, slanting willows.
In but a moment, the tide returns again—
From here, I set sail on a transcendent raft.

**Travelers at South Pond**
Wheels and hooves rush to and fro,
The road links north and south, passing through Min’s mountains.
Pity the restless souls in the red dust—
How can they compare to the immortal palace’s leisurely days and months?

**Wood Ridge’s Woodcutter’s Song**
The woodcutter’s song echoes from Wood Ridge,
The rugged path darkens as the sun sinks.
Melodious, it drifts across winding streams,
Gentle, it emerges from layered forests.
Low, it mingles with the golden cicadas’ tune;
High, it follows the white cranes’ cries.
Within the jade palace, no vulgar notes—
Hearing this, the heart’s cares dissolve.

**Bell Mountain’s Pagoda**
As the sun rises, Bell Mountain’s air feels new,
A seven-tiered pagoda surges in phosphorescent splendor.
Since ancient times, this blessed land has borne the wise and noble—
In this sagely age, those inscribed are not few.

**Two Poems for Xu Nancun**
Mud and wood assume forms—how laughable indeed,
Yet you patch rustic words into poetic lines.
Sir, you are no Master Pang,
Yet how does your lamp’s light pervade the great chiliocosm?

Ashamed I lack the skill to season the broth,
I playfully blend all things into fragrant harmony.
Feasting in the butcher’s hall, one knows many flavors—
Mock not the mountain dweller’s wild greens and amaranth.

**Ten Marvelous Peaks of Jade Mountain**

**Golden Immortal Peak**
The cinnabar turtle’s thousand-year embers have turned to ash,
Only its towering stone halls remain, jagged and grand.
Casually ascend the summit to gaze afar—
Beyond the clouds, the verdant Five Terraces rise.

**Heavenly Pillar Peak**
Step by step, nearing the mountain’s front,
Suddenly, bell tones shatter the dawn mist.
A peak abruptly rises, sheer as a wall—
Its strength seems enough to prop up the sky.

**Sunrise Peak**
At dawn, the stone cliff pierces the clouds,
Dripping spring sounds chill the night air.
I thought only the gibbons’ cries marked the predawn,
Yet when I open the door, the sun has climbed three poles high.

**Third Young Master’s Peak**
By the Fishing Creek, a fishing boat,
I ask the passerby—do you know his surname?
With a smile, I point to this mountain’s refined charm:
Wildflowers, singing birds—enough for carefree wandering.

**Golden Splendor Peak**
From afar, it seems a painting, seizing heaven’s artistry,
Hazy mountain light reflects the evening glow.
The pines and firs atop the ridge hold ancient intent—
Who knows that in the dead of night, the robe has already been passed?

**Rising Cloud Peak**
For miles, the path winds around the mountain’s flank,
Dawn’s hues remain dim, the mist not yet dispersed.
Scratching my head in the blue haze, I lose the way—
Only the sound of a single thunderclap from the mountain’s base.

**Treasure Terrace Peak**
Layer upon layer, its form rivals Kunlun’s cliffs,
The gallery path seems celestial, beyond climbing.
A single point of pure light ever shines before me—
Pine winds and cassia moons make a fine livelihood.

**Great Seat Peak**
After rain, the mountain mist dyes the peaks dark,
The stone path is slick, few travelers pass.
The meditator naturally grasps the dharma of meditation—
From where does the cold bell toll at dawn?

**Jade Angelica Peak**
A single heavenly flower, still unopened,
Who plucks it and does not offer it?
Straight to the summit’s peak I sit,
At times, its fragrance wafts to Tiantai.

**Twin Lads Peak**
The hanging terrace’s bright mirror turns with the clear light,
The Jade Maiden once tested the morning’s zither.
Ever like maidens in their youthful days,
Forever young, their hair never turns white.

**East Stream**
The stream’s voice is just this—water murmuring,
Ever constricted, it flows away and does not return.
Countless worldly affairs are all thus—
How can they compare to the white gulls’ leisure on the sand?

**West Stream**
In the mountains, idle guests visit one another,
I ask those coming from the west—their intent?
Neither increasing nor decreasing, without hindrance,
Following the current, they pass through the Heavenly River.

**Jade Cliff**
I love the mountain, thus I love the jagged stone,
The jade-grade mountain becomes a jade brother.
Twin streams divide, sending white egrets forth,
Ten peaks encircle, half green and half withered.
In the mortar of light clouds, tea holds many flavors;
By the lamp of the waning moon, a volume of scripture.
By chance, I reach the upper hall to ask of Chan—
Surely they know I am no ordinary man.

**Two Poems Seeing Off Chen Daoxing to Dragon-Tiger Mountain**
Within Zhongnan Mountain lie many fine scenes,
Yet alas, the ambition for fame and rank still smolders.
On the Dragon-Tiger Board, a new name appears—
Plum blossoms first claim the hundred flowers’ primacy.

Recommending the true and evaluating the worthy—this is ancient numen,
Aiding others’ good deeds paves the way ahead.
Magpies call to report news of peace—
I compose these verses to send you on your journey.

**Matching Monk Dejian of White Cloud**
Speak not of Qin, Sui, Jin, Han, or Tang—
The three gates, the thatched hut, the land of white clouds.
The water buffalo does not leave; the mountain’s old man is false—
I ask you: in those years, did you burn incense?

**Four Occasional Poems**
Within stillness, heaven and earth reckon not the spring,
Affirming and negating—let the myriad things whirl.
Where now are Xing Yuan and Zui Bai?
Beyond the clouds, green mountains—mountains beyond clouds.

I once heard the song of the captured unicorn,
Only to learn that Master Gao was a fine man.
The lotus flower, about to speak, holds many sentiments—
How can it compare to the speechless flower’s sunlit spring?

Where to seek the bright moon and clear wind?
Poets’ bitter thoughts dissolve in wine.
Forgetting schemes, unconcerned if others understand,
The sand gulls alone know this heart.

Two autumns have passed since I forgot you,
This feeling remains unspoken—do you know it?
Beyond the green mountain gate, many sentiments linger,
Left for poets to take as their topic.

**Lyrics**

*"To the Tune of ‘Linjiang Xian’ – The Hall of Kindred Harmony"*
Painting, calligraphy, zither, and chess—joys of life,
A household brimming with harmony, round as the moon.
Grandchildren in festive play fill the hall,
Together we pour a cup of wine,
As one we toast to boundless years.

Mind fixed on transcribing the *Huangting* script’s secrets,
Within the sprouting bud, the cinnabar field is nurtured.
Wealth and honor, like the immortals’ greens—all are but the Dao.
Names inscribed in golden registers,
Sleeves brushed by the incense of the imperial censer.

*"To the Tune of ‘Qianqiu Sui’ – The Hall of Swallowing Joy"*
Turtle Peak’s blessed land,
Mountains and waters rich with wonders.
Remember the old prophecy of the net’s catch—
Heaven-sown unicorns,
Phoenixes and mandarin ducks, omens among men.

And now, behold!
A son’s ambition fulfilled, the bow set aside,
Young, he ascends the ranks of scholars.
Still more joy—both parents live,
Long may we wish them,
A thousand, thousand years.

Lao Lai in motley play,
The Queen Mother’s feast at Jasper Pool,
Together we revel,
The hall filled with laughter,
Golden goblets drunk with mirth.

*"To the Tune of ‘Xiangsi Yin’ – For Elder Shen Jian"*
The spirit of mountains and peaks stirs jade’s essence,
Rising to form Turtle Peak.
Clear mountains, graceful waters,
Fortune comes in fleeting delight.
Should one ask of future affairs and profit,
But store up hidden virtue within the square inch of the heart.
Plant the locust tree, as the prophecy foretells—
Surely it will make you one of the Three Dukes.

*"To the Tune of ‘Qingping Le’ – For Zhou Tong"*
Seated in the hall’s purity and elegance,
With joy, hand in hand.

The moon clears, the wind gentle—such grace is found everywhere,
Best to chant poems and pour wine.
Autumn comes, cold dew chills,
Yet why not paint lightly or boldly as you please?
By the fence, golden chrysanthemums bloom,
Their late virtue still fragrant as they age.

*"To the Tune of ‘Geng Lou Zi’ – For Zhou Ming"*
A tranquil family’s virtue is finest,
Delighting in pond lotuses and window grasses.
Leaning on the desk, resting by the rail,
All pure fragrance flows as one.
A sliver of moon hangs low,
Unnoticed, the fifth watch arrives.
The lamp reports joy as magpies call,
Morning dawns bright and clear.

*"To the Tune of ‘Huan Xi Sha’ – For Lin Zhuang"*
Right and wrong fill the world’s questions,
Better to learn the Dao and refine the elixir of immortals,
Still whistling long as you enter the deep mountains.
Three paths grow wild—who will tend them?
Chrysanthemums and pines as friends, the gate of glory barred,
Find peace in seclusion where white clouds idle.

*"To the Tune of ‘Xiang Jian Ju’ – For Zhang Guilong"*
Wind mild, sun warm—two or three springs,
Rain clears, skies blush red and purple.
A hundred flowers like brocade, willows like silk floss,
From the high tower, pearl curtains roll up.
The master’s home,
Once more welcomes the returning pair of swallows,
Let the calendar be woven anew.

*"To the Tune of ‘Ye Jin Men’ (Also ‘Xi Xiang Yi Qiao’) – For Guo Yongfang"*
Clouds thin, rain thick,
February’s hundred flowers bloom red.
Travelers come and go,
East or west, as the wind differs for ox and horse.
Mountains green again,
Waters green again,
The path winds nine turns like a sheep’s gut.
Best to entrust your heart’s affairs to the messenger,
For five times five marks the future’s course.

*"To the Tune of ‘Ying Tian Chang’ – For Zheng Ruxian"*
Swallows and orioles dance face to face,
Relying on the Eastern Lord to rule forever.
Rain then clear, clear then rain,
Playfully ask the peach blossoms—they smile but do not speak.
The sun sets behind western hills,
Clouds veil the dusk,
Crows weary of flight return home.
Should you ask where the future’s goodness lies,
In the full moon of the fifteenth night.

*"To the Tune of ‘Shan Hua Zi’ – For Guo Yili of Tianyi Temple"*
Alone he bolts the wicker gate, unconcerned with worldly affairs,
What in this world equals clouds’ idleness?
Do not say the heartless always drift from the peaks,
For even they know to return—not as mist, not as smoke.
In nothingness, King Xiang’s dream of Wu,
Cold in brocade robes.
One offering of heart’s incense,
This is the true dwelling in famous mountains.

*"To the Tune of ‘Shuang Tian Xiao Jiao’ – For Taihe Mountain Monk De Run"*
A staff flies through empty space,
A hundred-foot robe and bowl passed down.
Silently listening to morning bells and evening drums,
Fire extinguished in the heart’s core.
Incense fills the golden censer,
Seated atop the high peak.
Should one ask of Śākyamuni’s heir,
What is the cave of *ā-luó*?

*"To the Tune of ‘Dian Jiang Chun’ – For Shijing of Yueshan Temple"*
A karmic bond for this generation,
The school of learning flourishes, the Dharma treasure’s sound rings clear.
True and not false from the start,
At the critical moment, the patriarch returns.
I once sought the false,
But now, at the sound of the bell, I strike,
Laying down the hammer and tongs.

*"To the Tune of ‘Yu Lou Chun’"*
All contention over purity is but the Buddha’s law,
Tending life among the flower-and-herb railings.
The old master of Yunmen startles all,
Best to question and answer with the *huatou*.
This karmic bond is a seamless pagoda,
Return to me with Deshan’s shout and blow.
From here to the Western Heaven, ten thousand miles and more,
Walking to and fro, again and again.

*"Repairing the Palace, Sewing Robes – To the Tune of ‘Man Gong Chun’"*
Mending the eastern wall, patching the western,
Every task uneven, not the same.
Where the human heart is steadfast, stone can be pierced,
Let us all exert our strength together.
Embroidered silk robes,
Stitched silk skirts,
Costing a thousand needles, ten thousand threads.
Where effort is great, value is high,
Surely fame will rise and shine.

*"To the Tune of ‘Xi Qian Ying’"*
Seeing no shadow, hearing no sound,
Yet in the dark room, a spirit lingers.
Not incense by morning, not lamp by night,
Sincerity may dwell in the square inch of the heart.
Turning to clouds, covering as rain,
Worldly affairs cycle thus.
Ancient vines and old trees endure through many springs,
Now once more renewed.

*"To the Tune of ‘Xi Xi Sha’ – For Painter Cai"*
A master of brush and ink, the world acclaims,
I once composed verses for *Huatang Chun*,
Who knew the marvel would capture the spirit?
Four limbs flawless in beauty,
Eyes left unmarked to preserve truth,
Was Gu Kaizhi ever truly a fool?

*"To the Tune of ‘Huatang Chun’"*
Clear wind and bright moon cost no coin,
The brush’s *qi* and charm are natural.
Loosening robes, squatting on bricks—called a true immortal,
This too is a chance encounter.
Depicting gods, ghosts, and a hundred strange things,
With thick smoke and pale ink, fresh and vivid,
Everyone says it rivals my own skill.

*"To the Tune of ‘Shang Ping Xi’ – For a Young Man of Changyi Bound for Hunan"*
Good child,
With aspirations for the four directions.

**"To the Tune of ‘Pu Sa Man’ – For Guo Dongtang of Tianwang, Bound for Tongcheng"**
A true man’s heart rides a white steed,
By chance beneath blossoms with his beloved,
Exchanging words, baring their hearts,
Wine cups filled once more.
Where lies longing? For her lover,
She straightens his lapels again.
A song in her heart, a handkerchief in hand,
A flute beneath the pillow, a lute in its bag—
Rising, she sings in the Yue mode.
Silken bed-words urge her lord:
*"You must learn from Su Qin,
That good fortune aligns with desire,
To gird a seal and bear gold."*

**"To the Tune of ‘Pu Sa Man’ – For Tongcheng"**
Tongcheng has its own Lu Shu,
Where he dons robes, holds his alms bowl,
And cultivates the Way.
Suddenly awakened, he asks of the path ahead—
The road ahead lies smooth and level.
*"Do not shrink from a thousand miles’ distance,
But vow the bodhi resolve.
When good deeds joyfully complete,
A true man shall bear witness."*

**"To the Tune of ‘Gui Zi Yao’ – Exhorting Painter Cai"**
Have you not seen
The immortals of Penglai’s three isles,
Alone reigning amid clouds,
Their palaces of lapis lazuli revealed?
Beyond the fence-gate, white as silk,
For rough sketches—take care,
Lest dust ever soil them.

**"For Tai Linjun on Asking Matters – To the Tune of ‘Xi Jiang Yue’"**
They speak of the Layman of Xiangcheng,
And call Jia Dao a transcendent talent.
With ladders and go-betweens for literary ascent,
All rests on merit and fame.
*"Snatching mustard seeds"*—his descendants’ fortune,
Did he not know of the Wangs’ three sophoras?
The third son was indeed the third top graduate,
His name eternal through the ages.

**"For the Dragon Boat Craftsman – To the Tune of ‘Xi Jiang Yue’"**
Knowing the art of grasping dragons,
Daring to present a bow’s design.
On the Mid-Autumn moonlit night, reaching the Milky Way,
All on earth gaze up at me.
Crafting a thousand-year reputation,
Together they praise a generation’s elegance.
A silk banner bestowed as a gift,
Better than a pig’s trotter or a cup of wine.

**"Love-Matching Poem"**
Silken breezes in the third month’s festival,
A heart adrift in fragrance.
Hard to restrain—the stirring of youthful passion,
Why not let it burst forth?
Following the beat, tuning the tongue,
Never waste spring’s light.
All sixty-six—mere romantic dalliances,
Amid the flower-market’s throng.
Since you stand in the highest vantage to admire blossoms,
No need to feign reluctance at the door.

**"For the Prefect of Min County"**
A stellar envoy, a paragon among hosts,
The brush-tip governor of the Seven Min.

**On the Transformations of Nature and the Seasons**

In years past, when Shao was established in Jian,
The elders rejoiced to cling and detain him.
Truly, his governance was as clear as water,
Beneath the sweet pear’s shade, clouds drifted.
Again, word came of virtuous rule in the south,
The lanes sang his praise, the roads hummed his name.
Now, blossoms fill the county—
Prefect Pan cherishes them,
Yet need not cling so tightly.

**My Own Pleasure in Travel**

Amid the marketplace’s revelry,
I hear the post station’s wind and moon make fine scenes.
I ask in jest—
Is it true there are brocade embankments by the thousand,
And his reputation resounds through the imperial capital?

**On Secretary Tingyu of Tailin’s Inquiry**

Before and after this life—unfathomable,
Why not shave my head and learn from the Tathāgata?
Where is the Tathāgata?
Bound for Tiantai.
The summit of Great Emaciation Ridge remains untouched,
Why sweep the dust from the mirror stand?
For now, ascend the highest peak and sit,
And make this my livelihood.

**For Five Colleagues**

I hear the river village was snow-laden last night,
And now the plum blossoms gleam white.
The southern branch bears tidings of spring’s arrival—
Snow and plum blossoms open side by side,
What fine spirits they evoke.

Plucking plum blossoms before the snow, wordless,
Plum and snow truly like a painting,
Enhanced by moonlight gracing the pavilions.
The mood of plum, snow, and moon—hard to fathom,
With two or three cups.

**Petition for the Appointment of Xuanbiao Zhenjun**

We humbly submit: though the Gate of Heaven stands but a footstep away, none have prostrated in loyal remonstrance. The sacred precincts are stern and bright—how dare we presume to petition before the celestial throne? Overwhelmed and trembling, we can neither advance nor retreat.

Your servant [Name] respectfully reflects: the Primordial Master, the Heavenly Master, holds the sacred rank, his Dao transmitted from the Prior Heaven, his teachings proclaimed through a hundred generations as the covenant of truth, an eternal transmission for the unlearned. We, your servant, though charged with ritual duties and bound by precepts, dare not act alone in private schemes without first submitting this plea. There are established precedents—we must await the guidance of left and right hands, never straying from the law. The ranks of East and West must stand as one, each in their proper place. On an auspicious day, we shall perform the Luotian Jiao rites to express our gratitude to Lingji Zhenren. Yet we fear that fellow altar practitioners may not yet heed the wondrous teachings, and though we strive together in the Dao, we dare not prolong this petition further. The statutes prescribe penalties for transgressions—we tremble lest we violate their severity.

**Petition of Gratitude for the Appointment of Xuanbiao Zhenjun**

We, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We reverently consider the Marshal, the Great Dharma Master, whose merit pervades transformation and nurture, whose Dao penetrates the profound and subtle. As rivers and marshes flow boundlessly, all return to the sea in homage. Yet before the radiance of sun and moon, who would dare cover their eyes? We gaze toward Heaven to repay its grace, yet our devotion remains imperfect, our efforts exhausted. Our transgressions pile like mountains, our merits weigh no more than dust. Yet by your gracious indulgence, you heed our words without rejection.

We, your servant, though dwelling in the Cavern of Truth, remain unenlightened, aged and incapable. Yet through the intercession of memorials, we are deemed worthy. How could we presume to advance in the immortal ranks, coveting merit or usurping rank? Now, as Xu [Name] and others are elevated in rank and bestowed imperial favor, we, who partake of the land’s bounty, share in the gratitude for life’s blessings. With hands raised and feet dancing, we unite in reverent joy. To speak further would be presumptuous—we fear only transgression.

**Petition of Gratitude for the Bestowal of Rank**

The rites for warding off calamity and averting disaster are solemnly observed. Those who build merit and accumulate virtue deserve advancement in the immortal ranks. Though the divine cannot be measured, our thoughts and words must be laid before them.

We, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We recall the Yellow Emperor, who sought the essence of the supreme Dao from Guangchengzi, and the Magistrate of Sangkan, who followed Lord Lao to fathom the mysteries of the profound and dark. Vast and boundless, the Dao eludes all grasp—expansive as a valley, it embraces the ten thousand things. Broad and ever-flowing, it transcends the small and incomplete. It does not abandon simplicity, and in its vastness, all things find completion. To align with the times is the mechanism of rising above the mundane and entering sainthood; to hold fast to the center and embrace the One is the essence of learning.

The Primordial Yang Jade Calendar must be entrusted to the right person. The precious scriptures of the Most High condense the qi of spontaneity. When mortals recite them, their lives are prolonged; when spirits hear them, they ascend as immortals. Each bears the karmic causes of past lives, and thus their merits defy all reckoning.

We, your servant, though longing for the Dao, lack the talent of the worthy. We have not mastered the method of extracting lead and merging mercury in the golden elixir, yet we dare to undertake the duty of submitting sealed memorials. We reflect further on the Jiao leaders, who, sheltered by the divine, dwell in peace within their villages, honored at the shrine of Lingji. Endowed with wisdom and virtue, they bring timely sunshine and timely rain, fulfilling the auguries of tortoise and milfoil. Their merit serves the state, their blessings nourish the people—we recall the enduring joy inscribed on their monuments. Though millet and sorghum lack fragrance, we offer them in sacrifice. On the mornings of the Three Origins when blessings converge, we observe a day of fasting and abstinence. By the grace of the Heavenly Master above and the imperial favor below, we are adorned with honorific titles, our names resplendent. Such glory is unheard of in antiquity and unmatched in the present age.

This is all due to the august presence of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven. The vault of Heaven arches above, the Emperor governs all—beneath his encompassing gaze, his benevolence has long been celebrated. We, your servant, are but lowly as ants and lice, foolish and dull. Only when we behold the celestial majesty of dragon and phoenix do we dare to speak. Though the divine may rely on talent, how could we idly occupy our positions? We must not fabricate affairs to seek merit. We have received more than our due—our gratitude is boundless. Yet we remain as one who clings to a tattered robe, ever mindful of treading on thin ice.

We humbly pray that your majesty’s virtue may endure for a hundred generations, that your blessings may descend in abundance, and that the imperial mandate may bestow prosperity upon all people. We, your servant, dare not cease in our reverence and awe. With this memorial, we respectfully express our gratitude.

**Memorial of Gratitude for the Bestowal of Rank at the Golden Palace**

Your servant [Name] humbly received the imperial decree on the first day of the third month, appointing me as the Nine Heavens Golden Palace Illuminated Dao and Virtuous Great Immortal, Manifest Spirit, and Universal Savior Zhenren, charged with overseeing the Upper Clarity Heavenly Texts Academy and all matters therein. Gazing toward the Golden Palace, we receive the imperial mandate—our new title inscribed upon the cinnabar terrace, our place secured among the immortal ranks. The radiance of this favor is profound, our awe and trepidation all the greater.

We, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We reverently consider the Supreme Jade Clarity Palace, where all is carefree and joyous. Beyond lies the Mysterious True Realm, luminous and resplendent. Its symbols shine like the double halos of sun and moon, its auspicious signs weave through the five-colored mists. The myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms gather in attendance. Dragons and tigers array to the left and right, phoenixes and simurghs sing before and behind. This is the celestial realm’s delight—how could one of lowly station ever hear of it?

Through the revolutions of kalpas and the turning of the wheel, we awaken to the necessity of cultivating fasting and practicing the Dao, aspiring to attain sagehood and achieve perfection. We reflect that spirits are vast and unfathomable, while we dwell in the turbid world, rushing about. Sacrificing animals in worship, we know only the schemes of flesh-eaters.

The millet and sorghum are not fragrant; I humbly accept my place among those who partake of plain meals, clinging only to grass and trees. I have achieved no merit near or far, yet mistakenly received undeserved favor out of turn, belonging still to the ranks of witless spirits. From the Purple Tenuity Palace, the imperial edict is proclaimed; the Emperor’s Seat descends to the palace balcony. Its light approaches the Seven Stars, illuminating all within nine thousand li. My rank equals that of the constellations—numbering one hundred eighteen in all—overseeing the distribution of emoluments at the Three Terraces and assisting the Literary Prosperity in the Six Ministries. When virtue gathers, worthy men rejoice in assembly; when the Dipper overturns, the year’s grains yield abundance. The Old Man appears at the center of the Southern Culmen, below harmonizing with the Auspicious Staircase’s sign—all by the Emperor’s power, what merit is mine?

This is only because I have encountered the August Heavenly Jade Emperor beneath the Jade Steps. His great virtue is called "life," lofty and supreme; though without sound or scent, he is indeed possessed of form and image. With drums and banners, he once vowed to deliver humanity; holding the tally and wielding the calendar, he alone opened the origin of embodying the Dao. The cinnabar script revealed the essence of warmth and governance, while the green characters presented the auspicious omens of the Milky Way. Thunder issues decrees, the celestial river becomes his decree. Majestic is his descending might; he entrusts me with the selection of the Cultured Right. I, your servant, ascend the hall with sword and shoes, rejoicing in the worthy’s attainment, as the gowned and hatted come to court. I emulate the feudal lords’ offering of jade, deeply favored by grace, diligent in my duties.

I cannot contain my awe as I gaze upon the heavens and long for the sagely presence, overwhelmed with reverence. Humbly I present this memorial in gratitude.

**Memorial of Thanks for Accepting Office at the Jade Tower**

I, your servant, respectfully received on the first day of the third month the decree appointing me as the Nine Heavens Jade Tower Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao Supreme Immortal, Illustrious and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One, to govern all courts of the Lower Realm’s Earthly Prison and act with full authority. I prostrate myself before the solemn Jade Tower, bowing near the celestial steps; the golden script bestows honor, specially ennobling my appointment in the Earthly Prison. Overwhelmed by this private favor, I know not how to respond. Reverently I take my place, traversing countless millions of li. Uniting the Four Seas in shared custom, the twenty-eight lunar lodges encircle the heavens; corresponding to the Nine Provinces’ divisions, the three thousand worlds and all sentient beings are subject to the illumination of stars, sun, and moon. Whether forests, trees, mountains, or rivers—high or low—all are human: truly, how joyous!

I pray to open the purple sunlit cloud-brocade satchel and attain deliverance within the Jade Chamber’s cinnabar terrace. Though the Most High does not lightly bestow, I am fortunate that this humble servant may partake in hearing it. Day and night I press on, my spirit ever facing the divine. Reflecting, I am no ghost concealing myself but rely on others to act upon my thoughts. Though I wish to fulfill the heart of fasting and serving the Emperor, I remain subject to the reproach of gluttony and worthlessness. My fields are barren stone, my worldly ties unsevered. Mistakenly I have received the honor of imperial edicts and elegant decrees, specially entrusted with the people’s welfare. I exhort goodness and punish evil, penalize transgressions and reward merit. The virtuous have their names recorded in the Southern Palace; the guilty have their souls confined in the Northern Bureau. I oversee the immortal registers of the Three Isles’ sacred mountains and govern the true administrations of the Five Peaks and Four Continents.

Reverently I receive this solemn charge, trembling with awe. The flying squirrel must measure its strength; even the great turtle cannot bear such grace. This is only because I have encountered the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven. The myriad forms flow into being, his favor reaches the utmost. He commands the transformations of yin’s gloom and yang’s ease, the powers of spring’s birth and autumn’s harvest. The Emperor’s chariot soars, the stars array in guard. The Dark Capital stretches boundlessly, adorned with the seven treasures. Auspiciousness unfolds in the azure vault’s hymns; I look up to praise the Jade Emperor’s august title. Repeatedly I have received his gracious commands, surpassing my peers. Ashamed of my lack of merit, I have been elevated—my body cleansed, my sincerity already expressed in offerings of pondweed and water plants. In divining harvests and praying for the year, there is the joy of millet, sorghum, rice, and grains. Below, I fulfill the people’s wishes; above, I answer the heavens’ intent.

I cannot contain my gratitude for this grace, overwhelmed with reverence. Humbly I present this memorial in gratitude, performing the rites with reverent words.

**Memorial to the Heavenly Master**

It seems your virtue has long sheltered the southern Min, while I gaze toward the northern palace, once more beholding the sun and moon’s light. The imperial decree’s favor descends, and I blush in self-reproach. I am truly fearful and awestruck, bowing my head again and again.

I have heard that Mount Ci once manifested its form at the river’s edge, receiving the great emperor’s enfeoffment in the catalpa shrine. Reverently it descended its brush upon Min and E, extravagantly celebrating the Primordial Emperor’s praise. Through filial piety and sincerity, heroic deeds attain the Dao; through woodcutting and smelting, compassionate aid achieves success. If not for vowing to deliver humanity, how could one transcend the mundane and enter sageliness? Such things exist—how could they be mere chance?

Turning to my own conduct, only the Dao is great. Since the Great Ultimate’s division, there have been the people and the altars of state. By the end of the five kalpas, who shall uphold the guiding principles? This is only because I have encountered the Orthodox Unity, Tranquil Response, Divine Transformation, Manifest Assistance Perfected Lord. When the heart can respond with tranquility and attain the Dao, silently merging with the divine and transforming, it is effortless non-action; when manifesting assistance, it is as if abundantly present. His aspiration is to aid the state and pacify the people; his heart is to establish teachings and set forth regulations. Purple characters and golden names mark the registers of medicinal pearls; jade seals and vermilion tallies translate the phoenix-script texts. The Dao’s law precedes heaven, its learning transmitted to later ages. The hundred spirits guard it; the myriad things revere it. The Great Mystery’s fifteen govern the world from Ghost Valley; the Supreme Yang’s First Administration corresponds to the Horn Star. His numinosity shines through antiquity, his deeds recorded in historical transmissions—beyond the contemplation of one such as I. This is why the Master’s Dao is uniquely revered.

Reflecting, I, your servant, rely on others to act, clinging only to the divine. I am akin to rotting grass, a decaying tree without pattern. My stele inscriptions are doubly shamed by Lord Liu; my posthumous name barely survives in Jin history. I cannot distinguish medicine from stone, much less know of Ma Fu or Niu Sou; my furnace and tripod are incomplete—how could I recognize dragon lead or tiger mercury? Though I possess the will to save things, I initially lack the talent to order the world. In divining like Junping and practicing auspicious arts, I merely instruct in loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, following the teachings of Confucius.

Still, critics admonish me—marvels, powers, and spirits disrupt the Dao, and by these I scheme. Unaware of what I emulate, I have long called such reckless acts a sin from which no earth affords escape. Who could have foreseen that undeserved grace would fall from heaven, that honors would elevate my rank, that I would ascend the immortal ranks, receiving this as if it were my due? To gain it truly startles me. Adrift on the sea of the great leviathan, my spirit flees and my soul trembles; bearing the mountain of the giant turtle, my virtue swells with profound favor. Since assuming office, I have remained as cautious as at first. Upholding the rites of repentance and admonition, I know my own recklessness and fail to grasp the essence of scriptural teachings—yet I still hope for enlightenment. All this stems from my master’s transmission; how dare I claim it as my own achievement? I revere the sagely transformation and proclaim the winds of benevolence. Above, I pray for the sovereign’s longevity, echoing the triple invocation of Mount Song; below, I ensure my people receive the blessings of the *Ji Chou*, as the talismanic transmissions foretell. May sons beget grandsons, and grandsons beget sons in unbroken succession. Though the rites of pepper and orchid may lapse, only the Dao resides in the heart, and the heart is the Dao. Even dogs and horses know to love their master—how could ants and crickets fail to convey their devotion? My heart brims with longing for grace, to the point of trembling awe.

I, your servant, now submit this memorial in gratitude.

**Memorial of Gratitude to the Heavenly Master and True Lord for Appointment**

I have heard that the Dao’s vastness is called greatness, beginning in emptiness, tranquility, and non-action. The spirit attains oneness and becomes numinous, discerning advance and retreat, life and death, without losing its correctness. When its emanations all strike true, who enables this? Is it not the karmic thread of past good fortune, allowing one to seize the moment and awaken?

I, your servant, offer my thanks: I observe that the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected One is upright in humanity and enlightened in divinity. Not merely scheming for sealed

**Memorial of Congratulation to the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One**

With reverence, we reflect upon Your Highness, the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One: repaying the state with loyalty, establishing merit through martial prowess. Selecting households for enfeoffment, you have long received the favor of the jade tablet’s grace. Issuing royal decrees, you once unsealed the golden casket’s writ. Your might shook the Huai and Yangtze, your blessings descended upon the garrisoned commanderies. Yesterday, the offering of winter-blooming camellia brought forth purple qi that filled the court; today, the auspicious omen of the blue arrow’s light illumined the chamber. We, your humble servants, though unworthy to stand in your shadow, have yet to fully bask in your boundless grace. Gazing toward the northern palace, we pour forth our devotion; pointing to the southern mountains, we pray for your longevity. We further hope that in the hall’s joyous feasting, all may nurture hearts of familial harmony; that within the four borders, peace may reign, and everywhere, the divine hemp’s shelter be enjoyed. We present this memorial in congratulation.

Moreover, as the new year begins in harmony, its auspiciousness is confirmed by the dawning day. The Nine Heavens resound with celebration, and all rejoice together in the praise of the divine. Auspicious qi drifts like clouds, while joyful voices thunder like thunder. I, your servant, in awe and trepidation, bow my head again and again to offer congratulations.

With reverence, we reflect upon Your Highness, the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One: your nature is upright and just, your rule both martial and civil. Once, your name was heard beyond the Yangtze; now, your deeds flourish in the heart of Min. The four directions’ worthies gather like crowns and tiaras; the radiance of sun and moon is doubled. For a thousand ages, incense and lamps endure, as eternal as heaven and earth. We bow our heads in homage, emulating the reverence of Zhao Hu; we raise our cups in toast, following the example of Ni Kuan. Thus, we practice the rustic rites and extend the village feast. There are those of high and low station, elders and youths—none dare transgress. They seek longevity, wealth, ease, and peace, each according to their prayers. We humbly present this memorial in congratulation.

I, your servant, in utmost joy and exultation, bow my head again and again. My heart brims with fervent devotion, earnest and unwavering.

**Memorial from the Southern Palace on Behalf of a Man Seeking Peace and Well-Being**

I have heard that the great Dao is without action—who can fathom the myriad mysteries of its profound profundity? Those who receive its deliverance may hope to endure through kalpas without end. Such truths are not for ordinary mortals to hear; only the virtuous are blessed with its fortune.

I observe that so-and-so conducts himself with frugality and humility, his nature upright and gentle. Yet, by an ill-fated alignment of the stars, he has suffered the afflictions of *Shichen*’s malevolence. Through earnest supplication, he has at last found relief from his ailments. Now, in the year of his sixtieth cycle, he encounters his natal day, though his appearance—his hair thinned, his vigor diminished—no longer matches his former self. Though aged and feeble, he is fortunate that the luminous Perfected One has granted him favor. The scriptures revealed from the Jade Bureau offer nothing but texts to dispel misfortune; the teachings expounded upon the Millet Pearl are all canons to deliver humanity. Such merits and virtues may serve as a bridge to salvation.

I, your servant, though unworthy among the Dao’s followers and presumptuous in performing ritual affairs, have contributed not even a fraction of the primordial work’s merit. How dare I repeatedly present my foolish petitions? With reverence, we reflect upon the Sacred Throne of the Southern Palace’s August Emperor: your benevolence is vast and your mercy boundless, your merits untainted by fault. You govern the nine yang’s mysteries, your Sanskrit vows forming the three caverns’ numinous power. The literary tablets record the embryos and forms of all beings; once endowed with shape and visage, you surely safeguard their lives, cherish their spirits, and ensure that the root of the numinous is watered, its branches flourishing and leaves abundant. You cause the primordial fluid to congeal and solidify, its source deep and its flow far-reaching. Let neither joy nor anger, nor pleasure’s excess, disturb our nature; let neither right nor wrong, nor gain nor loss, confuse our hearts.

Ascending to the Supreme Mystery, severing all perverse obstructions.
Inscribing names on cinnabar tablets, recording words in azure scriptures.
Above, we trace the grace of the Great Unity; below, we console the hopes of the people.
We humbly pray that white may reverse to black, outwardly transmitting the formula of agelessness;
That qi may turn from purple to embrace yellow, inwardly attaining the secret of eternal life.
Further, we hope that all households flourish in prosperity, their descendants thriving in abundance.
Also, on behalf of women engaging in preemptive cultivation—

We reverently consider: *The Scripture of the Yellow Court*, a single classic, emerged from the Fusang Palace, where we beseech to hear the Lady Wei’s expositions.
The three volumes of numinous writ descended upon the Cheng Hua Hall, joyfully receiving the Queen Mother of the West’s direct transmission.
These may extend our years and serve to establish teachings and regulations.

We reflect that though this servant has reached the age of sixty, my learning remains unworthy of mention. Unaware of the li and kan within myself, how can I fathom the great transformations of Heaven and Earth?
Yet, by the grace of the true shade, I have concealed myself in the mysteries of the Daoist codes. With deeper consideration, I recall the female disciple [Name], who, with her five-leaky body, dwells in the mundane world, merely indulging in frivolous laughter, nearly reducing goodness to ruin.
Her merit, appearance, speech, and virtue—none of the four teachings are complete.
Joy and anger, a single morning’s pleasure, the six emotions all encumbered.

In the year of *jihai*, coinciding with the seventh evening’s beginning,
The *gengshen* rites are recorded, yet I still fear the lurking Three Corpses.
Reverently facing the heavens, I submit this plea in proxy,
Resolving from this day forth to renew myself.
May the crown of my head become the cause of blessings,
And may I humbly beseech unseen assistance.

I reverently consider the August Emperor of Southern Florescence of Nanchang,
The Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Pole,
And the Life-Cherishing Lord Han, the Venerable Man—
Their transformative radiance manifests in the Eight Luminaries,
Their Dao pervades the Three Spirits.
Ten recitations of scripture deliver humankind;
Nine Yangs are refined into qi.
Vast and majestic their model,
Serene and boundless their origin.

I implore the Three Realms to descend as one,
To record your merits and erase your transgressions.
May the multitude of perfected ones be indiscriminately delivered,
Preserving your life and honoring your form,
Enabling you to endure through kalpas and abide long.
Daring to seize this moment of awakening,
I gaze toward the northern palace in hope of grace,
That my name be inscribed in the southern archives,
Receiving the texts of yellow threads and white tablets,
Etched in purple characters and golden names.
May your years be prolonged,
Eight thousand seasons turning as spring and autumn.
Bestow upon me boundless favor,
A hundred generations flourishing with descendants.
Above, embody the Supreme’s virtue of cherishing life;
Below, regard this servant’s earnest entreaty.

Gratitude to the master for recommending the completion of merit for the departed.
I have heard with joy of the *Western Ascension*,
Transmitted by Lord Lao,
And of the covenant rites receiving the *Yellow Emperor’s Questions on the Yin Talisman*,
Expounded by Guangchengzi.
Faithfully received and reverently practiced.
Were it not for karmic predestination,
How could one possess the bone-form of an immortal?

This servant, trembling with awe,
Bows his head again and again.
I reflect that my canine-and-horse years have reached eighty;
Though now aged, I remain capable of one final endeavor.
The dragon-and-phoenix scriptures—I have studied but two or three.
Yet even a fool, it is said, may achieve insight through a thousand considerations.
Since assuming this office,
I have guarded the Dao with strictness.
How can I discipline others
Without first demanding it of myself?
Talent must be tested:
Those with merit are rewarded,
Those with transgressions are punished.
Thus may all act with sincerity in virtue,
And prudence in speech.

I reverently consider the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Tranquil Response, and Manifest Protection—
His dharma transmitted as Orthodox Unity,
His Dao penetrating the subtle mysteries.
For ten thousand generations, he is the teacher of rulers,
The parent of all living beings.
He establishes teachings and regulations,
The Great Dharma Master of All Heavens,
Pointing the way to salvation and deliverance,
Rescuing the suffering and liberating the departed,
Awakening the vow of compassion.

Yet I fear that the spirits thus recommended,
Adrift in the turbid currents of fleeting life,
May have unwittingly committed errors.
In the endless night’s darkness,
Who recognizes the marvel of emerging from existence and entering non-existence?
Only through merit may this serve as a bridge.

I humbly pray that the Great Dao illuminate,
The earth be purged of demonic vapors,
The heavens free of drifting haze,
Soul and spirit purified and rectified.
Let the smoke-choked gates of death open,
The clouds part to reveal the gates of life.
May even the darkest yin realms
All receive the mysterious grace.

**Refinement and Deliverance Memorial**

I prostrate myself, for at the center of the Azure Heaven,
The *Scripture of Deliverance* is proclaimed.
After the kalpa of the August Emperor,
The *Stanzas of the Divine Generative Spirit* were covenanted.
As the great cycle nears its term,
The sacred texts emerge.

This servant, trembling with fear,
Reflects that my heart remains enslaved to things,
My body not yet merged with the true.
I have not heard of the tortoise-breathing method,
And deeply shame at my crane-hair and dragon-decrepitude.
Yet I lead the prayers with utmost sincerity,
Striving to practice diligently.

I fear that the departed spirits thus recommended,
Sunk in the dust of worldly illusion,
Entangled in emotional attachments,
May have unwittingly committed errors of thought, word, or intent.
Returning to the root and restoring the origin—
Who recognizes the marvel of essence, qi, and spirit?
Self-inflicted is the ruin of death;
Who knows the path to life?

I reverently consider the Great Emperor of the Divine Generative Spirit of the Nine Heavens—
His Dao pervades the Three Spirits,
His transformative power flows through the Two Luminaries.
In the East, he is known as the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful.
In Nanchang, he oversees the bureaus of Deliverance and Refinement.
Yin becomes po, yang becomes hun—
Only through yin and yang are they tempered.
Fire pertains to the heart, water to the kidneys—
Without water and fire, how could life be formed?

I implore the Great Creation to embrace all,
The true light to illumine thoroughly,
That the foul and putrid be utterly dissolved,
The withered and decayed, upon hearing, emit smoke.
May bones and flesh take flight together,
Form and spirit be made whole.
Inner thoughts not stray outward,
Outer thoughts not intrude within,
Forever cutting off the source of afflictions.
Once the register of qi is established,
And the qi of compliance is born,
A body of empty cavernousness emerges.
May all suffering souls
Bathe in this vast grace.

Moreover, the *Scripture of Deliverance*,
Recited ten times, revives withered bones.
The *Stanzas of the Divine Generative Spirit*,
Comprising nine chapters, liberates dark souls.
The Supreme attained this
To establish teachings and regulations.
Later students rely on it
To rescue the suffering and deliver the departed.

I reverently consider the sacred ranks—
Seven epochs aligned,
Three Spirits conjoined,
Above embodying the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.
Yin employs the even, yang the odd;
Within, the work of *li* and *kan* is illuminated.
Water seeks the damp, fire the dry.
A bridge for the multitude of sufferings,
A sun and moon for the lost multitudes.
My vows are profound,
My merit boundless.

I reflect that in recent years, old and senile,
My studies have grown neglected.
Tiger mercury and dragon lead—
I have not mastered the ninefold transmutations and completions.
Bear postures and tortoise breathing—
I know not the method of one inhalation and one exhalation.
Yet when I previously received the memorial,
I fulfilled my allotted duty.
Now, witnessing the filial devotion’s sincerity,
I reluctantly undertake the rites to preside over them.

I deeply consider the departed souls thus recommended—
Yesterday they possessed living bodies,
Today they enter the register of the dead.
Below, their hun and po are summoned,
Long wandering in the springs’ curves.
Knocking on skulls,
They have only recently found the joy of returning to their native mounds.
Without undergoing the refining furnace,
How can they transcend the ordinary?

I implore the Three Realms to descend as one,
The multitude of perfected ones to descend,
To deliver the dead souls for refinement,
Enabling them to transform into immortals.
Merging marvelously, dissolving forms,
Their kind dispersed across kalpas
Return to the One.
They must rely on the power of ascending the primordial,
Encountering the work of Brahma.

Moreover, in the Azure Vault of Floating Li,
The ten recitations of the *Scripture of Deliverance* are expounded.
From the Jade Terrace of Primordial Yang,
The nine stanzas of the *Divine Generative Spirit* emerge.
Since the transmission of these teachings,
Through successive masters and disciples.

I reflect that this servant, humbly among later students,
Has inherited the governance of the mysterious codes.
Yet I do not understand *li* and *kan* within myself,
Nor comprehend the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.
Still, I lead the prayers with utmost sincerity,
Striving to practice diligently.

Deeply I fear that the departed souls,
misled between past lives and deaths to come,
may have erred in their ways.
Some, succumbing to incurable ulcers,
are deemed to suffer karmic retribution—
yet where does the *po* soul wander?
Who guards the *hun* and sustains the *po*?
The form is no longer theirs—
who can refine the substance and temper the body?
Without the aid of incense and cultivation,
by what means can they transcend?

I reverently recall the sacred ranks:
empty and formless, they transform naturally.
They perceive the radiance of the Eight Luminaries,
and silently align with the Seven Mysteries in reverence.
The deliverance of the netherworld weighs heavily upon my vows.
I humbly beseech:
summon them through yin, call them through yang,
that the dead souls may undergo refinement.
Disperse them with wind, moisten them with rain,
that withered bones may be revived.

Moreover,
the Most High has bequeathed scriptures for the deliverance of souls,
while I, a minor official of scattered duties,
possess no talent for memorializing.
Bound by my station, what can I say?
Overwhelmed, I dare not falter.
I offer my gratitude, reverently recalling the sacred ranks:
they uphold Heaven’s ordinances, embody the Emperor’s radiance.
Though they seem distant and obscure,
who knows their ceaseless transformations?
Those who receive *qi* return to the bellows and bellows-bag;
those endowed with form emerge from the potter’s mold.
Breathing life into the withered, exhaling upon the decayed,
they silently master the wonders of yin and yang.
Above, they blaze; below, they moisten—
looking up, I fathom the workings of water and fire.
The formless can manifest in form;
the true sovereign acts without sovereign intent.
Their luminous, mighty deeds
deliver boundless beings.

I reflect upon the patron of this rite, a certain woman of this day,
whose heart aches with grief, tears flowing from her sorrow,
as she mourns her daughter’s untimely death.
Before eight days had passed, she was struck by her husband’s demise,
parting forever beneath the heavens.
This sorrow, this love—
nowhere to express, nowhere to plead.
I trust that King Wen’s grace
can extend even to withered bones.
Yet I, a mere alchemist, am ashamed—
my learning falls short of the divine elixir’s mysteries.
Still, following the guidance of the enlightened present,
the true souls may yet be delivered.

The Dao of Heaven perfects the male;
the Dao of Earth perfects the female.
Trace their origins, befriend their ends.
Moonlight becomes the *po*;
sunlight becomes the *hun*.
They inscribe your life, erase your death.

**Memorial for Redemption of Sins**

Rank is not to be profaned;
punishment is not to be trifled with.
All covet rank—
why then do they not fear punishment?
Merit is weighty;
sin is light.
Who examines merit to redeem sin?
All is self-inflicted.
If one acts in ignorance,
were it not for the Most High’s love of life,
the people would perish utterly.
Thus, the purple clouds of dawn unfurl,
and the pearl of millet is hung aloft,
granting absolution for transgressions,
rescuing the departed from suffering.
The tally is struck, amnesty proclaimed,
that the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus
may inspect the ghostly camps and expound the law.
Hearing the scriptures, countless spirits ascend,
and ten thousand ancestors take flight.
By this merit, the Golden Towers stand;
virtue becomes the bridge.

I reflect that I, with decayed teeth and hoary head,
am a pitiable, doddering figure.
Low in rank and humble in duty,
I am as clumsy as a lame horse.
Yet, charged with this office, I must speak and present my case.
Like a rat stirring at night,
I fear only being seen—
great shame would be my disgrace.
I would fall in terror, saved only by heaven’s grace.
I humbly beseech that my loyal sincerity be seen,
and the weight of a filial child’s devotion be recognized.
Today, I act on behalf of a grieving daughter, so-and-so,
who mourns her late father, so-and-so.
Since his self-inflicted death,
three years have passed,
and though she has long wished to perform rites,
her hopes remain unfulfilled.

I observe that the departed soul,
succumbing to an incurable ulcer,
was ultimately misled by the Two Fiends.
His heart was not deceitful—
why then was he drawn toward the Three Corpses?
Sincere words stirred, yet
it was said his hidden yin virtue was lacking.
Thus, he fell into the netherworld,
unable to awaken or understand.
Alas, the barrier between the living and the dead—
not something ears or eyes can perceive.
In the depths of prison,
even Gongye Chang was innocent.
To suffer as Dong Zhongshu did,
or endure the humiliation of Sima Qian—
was there no regret?

I, who have presumptuously taken office in the yang realm,
know nothing of yin’s laws.
To cleanse others,
I must first confront my own fears.
My voice, like thunder’s echo,
is but the caw of a crow that thinks itself loud.
Gazing to the ends of rivers and seas,
am I not like a fish that has slipped the net?
The Lü Clan once scrutinized the Five Punishments and Five Penalties,
while the *Rites of Zhou* spoke of Three Pardons and Three Amnesties.
Lacking Mulan’s filial piety,
how dare I presume to present a petition like Lady Tiying’s?
Like a moth drawn to flame,
where can I find refuge?
Like a stray dog without a home,
my plight is truly pitiable.

I reverently recall the sacred ranks:
they vow compassion,
responding to cries and answering pleas,
honored as the Most Unique of the Great One.
Their light shines universally across the Three Thousand Worlds,
to the easternmost reaches.
In the Wondrous and Solemn Palace,
they manifest in purple-golden form.
The Great Mystery knows no bounds—
I have heard of the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*.
Wishing to be a bridge for all beings,
they rescue from every suffering.

I humbly beseech:
swiftly erase the ledgers of sin,
and relocate his spirit to the Northern Mansion.
Select from the ranks of immortals,
and inscribe his name in the Southern Palace.
Let the winds of immortals carry his merit—
thus concludes the ninth scroll of *Xu Xian’s Elegant Writings*.
The tenth scroll of *Xu Xian’s Elegant Writings* begins.

Four Prayers for Peace

In this second month of mid-spring, all people pray for renewal, and the August Heavenly Lord does not forsake us. With a single heart we may reach the divine; our shared plea ascends, piercing the ninefold heavens.

We, the lowly, cling to life like ants and grubs, yet know gratitude. Though we dwell beneath the vast canopy of heaven and earth, our days pass in restless haste, untouched by the burdens of right and wrong. Searching our hearts, we find few who recognize their faults; reviewing our deeds, we see many who have wrought harm. Ever mindful of our fears, we dare rely on the power of this single offering.

May the gods above and below witness our virtue and guide us left and right. May farmers, artisans, merchants, and scholars rejoice in their livelihoods—thus shall they prosper.

---

The common people, ignorant, often invoke blessings through borrowed spirits. Yet the Heavenly Lord watches over you, without partiality in rewarding merit or punishing wrong. If He does not deceive us, aid will come to those who act in accord with the Way.

We, the humble, dwell by the mountains, hewing homes from stone and carving fields from slopes. As the stars of the Crow and the Winnowing Basket appear in mid-spring, we begin our labors in earnest. The barking of dogs carries across the four borders, and we long for the Great Stem. Knowing the hardship of earning our sustenance, we dare not withhold our sincerity in offering thanks.

Though we are frogs at the bottom of a well, unable to grasp the vastness of the world, even ants clinging to a cauldron deserve pity for their lives. May planting and weeding, from this day forward, yield harvests year after year. May peace and wealth—desires of all hearts—be granted by Heaven. Further, we pray for the flourishing of our cattle and livestock, truly bearing the weight of your boundless grace and nurturing care.

---

The will of the people is plain to see: their gaze and hearing are near, for they are the people themselves.

The Emperor’s command cannot be defied; with fasting and purification, we may offer sacrifice to the Emperor. Earnest in our pleas, we stand as though in the presence of His radiant majesty. We humbly reflect that we, like ants clinging to a cauldron or frogs at the bottom of a well, are greedy and shallow. Born in the Central Land, we have yet to fulfill our duties to our satisfaction. Now, as the Upper Prime arrives, we still hope for the blessings of the Heavenly Officials. Thus, we rely upon the Daoist adept to proclaim the true rites, reaching upward to the stern judgment of the axe and iron, and downward to the ears of even the lowliest creatures. Though the present may not know the past, we are fortunate that even impure customs may be renewed.

We pray that those like the Earl of Shen and the Marquis of Fu may rise again, and that those who follow may attain the longevity of Peng and the wealth of Tao, assuredly receiving such blessings. In all our movements and undertakings, we are truly indebted to the virtue of creation and nurture.

---

In this sixtieth year, on the day of my birth:
The Dao ever favors the good, and one must understand the causes of goodness. Our desire for peace has been fulfilled, and our wish for tranquility granted. Respectfully relying upon the Daoist adept, we present these written prayers. We humbly reflect that though my words are unworthy, I have now reached the age of ear-turning. Once afflicted with the ailment of gathering firewood, I now enjoy the blessing of recovery without medicine. Moreover, as the tenth month arrives, I mark my birth once more. Truly, I am indebted to the decree of Heaven and dare not betray my former vows. I pray that my later years may be prosperous and smooth, offering my sincere heart in gratitude. The merit of this act may be measured, and my reverence is as solemn as the fear of the tiger. May my ancestors rest in peace, their memory honored without fail. Looking upward, I seek divine aid; bowing downward, I beg for confirmation.

---

**Thanksgiving Prayer by a Woman for Preemptive Merit**
Rites, when overly elaborate, lead to disorder; only utmost sincerity can move the gods. Heaven guides the heart, and the accumulation of good deeds brings abundant blessings. Looking upward, we beseech the celestial hearing; bowing downward, we reveal our tender sentiments. We humbly reflect that I, your servant, lack the Four Virtues and that my many words are of little benefit. My learning is as unclear as the misreading of "three pigs," and now I approach the years beyond sixty, nearing seventy. My voice is as insignificant as a single fly, yet I fear repeating past mistakes. Removing my hairpin in submission, I gather my robes and present these words, repenting for past transgressions and cultivating future blessings. Further, I pray that my descendants, countless generations hence, may be enrolled in the register of Han Jun. May the Three Longevities be my companions, and may I receive the ode of Lu Hou.

---

**Preemptive Prayer by a Woman for the Yellow Register and Celestial Decree**
Human nature may incline toward good or evil, and even a foolish woman may comprehend this. Our desires for longevity and peace are met with Heaven’s favor, which brings only auspiciousness. Bowing low, I offer my enduring reverence; looking upward, I dare to disturb Your majestic countenance. We humbly reflect that I, your wife, am entangled in the desires of the world and submerged in the dust of the mundane. The five defilements of form and sound have surely brought their share of offenses. Though my hair is half-gray, I am fortunate to have reached the year of my birth once more. Overwhelmed and at a loss, I can only repent and give thanks inadequately. Respectfully, on the second day of the second month, I reverently partake in the rites of the Three Realms’ covenant with the true, dedicating the fruits of my merit in hope of Your grace. May this offering extend to my lord, deepening the love that binds us. May my later years be brightened, and may I further seek the joy of playful delight.

---

**Ritual Prayer for Thanksgiving**
As the year marks my sixtieth cycle, I find myself at this appointed time. My emotions struggle to reach the heavens, and I cannot avoid repeating my pleas. Rites must not be neglected, and words are spoken when the time is right. We humbly reflect that I, old and feeble, am without ability, confused and unenlightened. Recently afflicted with the lowly ailments of horses and cattle, I cried out to Heaven in desperation. Now, clinging to life like an ant, how can I not be moved by the earth’s compassion? Though my good intentions have taken shape in words, I am fortunate that the radiant gods may perceive my heart. Bowing low, I express my private gratitude; looking upward, I dare to disturb Your exalted hearing. As merit is fulfilled, may my name be inscribed in the golden register and white tally. May I be granted the blessings of abundance, longevity, health, and peace, as bestowed by the *Hong Fan* and *Ji Chou*. Further, I pray that my descendants may bring glory to their forebears.

---

**Prayer for the Ancestral Mother’s Protection**
To know gratitude is to know repayment; the August Heaven and Earth indeed hear our solemn words. To serve the dead as we serve the living is the duty of filial sons and obedient grandsons. Thus, we rely upon this pure rite, presumptuously beseeching the true banner. We humbly reflect that I was orphaned at four and received instruction through three relocations. In the past, through my grandmother, I suffered from an incurable blindness; my late father was deeply grieved by my drowning, yet could not save me. Though I repeatedly prayed to the gods, why did misfortune still befall me? Unfortunate in my short life, I wept as I recounted my unfulfilled vows, knowing not how to proceed. Fortunately, over the years, I have come to terms with my fate, easing my heart and freeing it from its initial burdens. The departed flow like this river, and may they soon align with Han Jun’s compassionate work. In the end, may there be care, and may the ode of Lu Hou praising a mother’s longevity be sung.

---

**Prayer for a Wife**
When illness strikes, one calls to Heaven, for there is no other recourse. If dreams bring harm, we seek to understand their cause. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; looking upward, I beseech the celestial hearing. We humbly reflect that I am bound by fate to the Dipper’s middle star, and my affairs are as discordant as Shen and Shang. Lamenting the hardships of my household, why are my family’s fortunes so fraught? Even beasts do not lose their mates—how could I lack the sentiments of the world? Though the bowstring may be rejoined, I cannot avoid new attachments. Despite the ugliness of painted brows and powdered cheeks, why am I afflicted by the misfortune of arrows piercing my chest? Perhaps the love and hate of the reed mat differ, rendering the healing of medicine ineffective. Thus, I have pledged to invoke the True Man of Lingji, proclaiming the repentance of the Nine Truths. I pray that the Most High Lord of the Great Monad may widely bestow His great compassion, releasing me from karmic transgressions and delivering me from suffering. Alas, my former wife—early did she fulfill the cause of the trailing tail. May my descendants be preserved, forever upholding the duty of the silken threads.

---

Moreover:
Heaven’s brightness is to be revered, for its power is manifest in what is seen and heard—how could it lack ears and eyes?

Where matters arise from nothingness, oaths and curses invoke the unseen—yet how can one bind the spirits of ghosts and gods? To believe so is folly indeed.

I, so-and-so, reflect in shame: my conduct has strayed from propriety, my ignorance as dull as the crawling of insects. Like a bandit breaching the inner gate, my voice went unheard even by the barking dogs. A wife’s loose tongue, like the clucking of a hen, truly invites scorn. What was taken in the rites must be returned—reason demands self-reproach. Yet if suffering arises from negligence, who would deny the cry of injustice? Rewarding good and punishing excess—swift as echo follows sound. To untie resentment and loosen knots, one may yet find refuge in the rites of repentance.

Moreover:
Heaven cannot be deceived—its gaze is lofty, its ears ever near. When man’s wrath stirs, it wells from the heart and takes shape in words. How can it be otherwise? One must seek its cause.

I, so-and-so, as a person, now ponder: recalling my late father, he clung to the folly of the waiting tree-stump, never expecting treachery to strike like a stone cast from below. I appealed to the August Emperor to judge right and wrong, and by good fortune, the courts rendered clarity. Ashamed of my clumsy pleas, how dare I betray my sworn vows? Humble and base as I am, I now approach the pure hall to offer rites of apology. My feeble efforts scarcely begin to repay the debt—yet if I delay further, I fear my resolve may waver again.

Flaws may be renewed as the sun and moon recover from eclipse; what use is brightness if it invites the censure of the *Spring and Autumn*'s unflinching brush?

**Establishing the Altar of the Mysterious Capital: Petition**

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the autumn of the *renxu* year, we reverently welcome the Earth Official on the day of his audit and recording.

The Mandate of Heaven is stern toward the people below. First, we exhaust the rites of purification and luminous reverence, arranging fragrant mats to humbly lodge our modest sincerity.

We reflect: our blood and *qi* share the same origin as all flesh. Though our departed kin could but offer the devotion of dogs and horses, how dare we forget the gratitude of crows and magpies? Time flows like this river—yet we err in composing these summoning verses. Yet if faults can be dissolved, we have heard it may be done in the space between turning palms.

Respectfully following the Mysterious Code, we solemnly invite the feathered adepts to perform these meritorious deeds and establish this karmic connection.

We humbly pray that the Three Officials of the Northern Fengdu may scrutinize the ghostly camps and swiftly expunge the ledgers of sin. May our countless ancestors ascend to the Golden Gates, each finding their path to rebirth. May all the lost and deluded together attain joy and liberation.

**Prayer for Averting Disaster**

Harmonious *qi* brings auspiciousness, while discordant *qi* brings anomalies—Heaven’s ways are inscrutable and without constancy. The Way of fortune lengthens as the Yin Way wanes; the return of the sun may be awaited.

We bow in lowly submission and gaze upward in presumptuous address.

We reflect: though we have fortunately secured safety, we have failed to maintain it. Though the multitudes petition for disaster-averting rites, we petty folk know the shame of our transgressions. None dares face the sunflower’s devotion; we can but fear the depths of the abyss. How can our village compare? We have but a humble puddle’s worth of reverence.

Thus we gather the Daoist clergy to solemnly conduct the ritual. We trust the people’s plight is easily seen and pray the Emperor’s wrath may be turned.

We humbly beseech that sand be transformed into harmony, sparing us the dread of neglected sacrifices. May we be granted longevity and prosperity, and may abundant blessings descend.

**Prayer for Preserving Fortune**

The Way of Heaven speaks not, yet responds—we offer our earnest supplications. The human heart’s desires, when sincere, must surely evoke a resonant response.

We inscribe this in our hearts, knowing our debt is profound.

We reflect: we, so-and-so, rely solely upon the divine, having no merits to recount. Yet we have been doubly favored by Heaven’s bounty and honored by our master’s grace. Recently, we entrusted Chen Daoxing with the *Dragon-Tiger* rites, and indeed received great protection. Now, with Elder Guo Yong, we fulfill the *Cricket’s* repayment, refusing to renege on our word.

Though this is the people’s hope, how dare we claim any credit for Heaven’s power? We further pray for the bestowal of the *gui zan* scepter, that we may await summons in the Purple Tenuity, and for the offering of fine grains, that the spirits may be at peace in the Pure Temple.

**Establishing the Ritual of Crossing: Petition**

The Heavenly Worthy expounded the teachings, pointing the way to salvation. For children honoring their parents, the foremost path is filial reverence.

We bow in earnest address, gazing upward to the azure vault.

We reflect: we, so-and-so, dwell in the dust. Though we have fortunately lived through the final kalpa, we recall those who bore and raised us, whose nurturing love was as deep as the canopy of heaven. Yet they linger between existence and oblivion—how hateful is the barrier between light and dark! Thus we rely on the feathered adepts to perform the true rites.

Today, we open the Mysterious Altar, seeking to ascend our prayers to the Imperial Palace. May our humble sincerity move the divine, and may great proof be granted.

Words cannot express our joy: the assembled hosts from the ten directions witness the deliverance of the living and the dead. By the grace bestowed upon the nine hundred, all hearts are poured forth. May the lost in the underworld all ascend to the shore of the Dao.

**Moreover,**

The hearing of Heaven is impartial; may it deign to perceive even a fraction of our foolish sincerity.

Here is the translation, maintaining consistency with the previous section’s style and terminology:

---

When rites grow excessive, they breed disorder—how deeply we fear the repeated offense of overburdening the divine, lest we incur fault through our own urgency. Yet there are matters that admit no delay.

We reflect: though we are but gnats in nature, ants in survival, each possesses a human heart—how could we lack good intentions? Now, as the Zhongyuan Festival approaches, we begin our fast eight days prior, wishing to forge karmic bonds with all beings. Thus we undertake the Nine Mornings’ Universal Deliverance, humbly invoking sacred power and beseeching the bestowal of gracious light. We dare offer our private gratitude, striving to manifest reverence from beginning to end. Further, we pray for the five viscera to be cleansed and cool, the six bowels harmonized and at peace. May the old regain their vigor, the young grow strong. May the Three Realms provide guardianship, the Five Emperors oversee their reception. May the *po* ascend, the *hun* be liberated.

Moreover,
Though Heaven’s height seems boundless, it never strays from the square inch of the heart. As mortals, we must be vigilant from the outset, ever mindful of the perils of neglecting the fast. Following the Yellow Register’s rites, we draw near to the purple radiance to invoke the sacred. Deeply reliant on the vast creation’s workings, we open wide the path of salvation. May the darkness of the underworld be illuminated, the long night ended, and the light of Yang Valley be beheld—each soul restored to spring.

**Second Morning’s Invocation**
The Dao is beyond naming—yet this very Heaven is called the Dao. Through fasting, reverence may be achieved. Pouring forth the sincerity of sunflowers turning to the sun, we beseech that the qi of fragrant herbs may move the divine. We pray for universal deliverance, benefiting both the living and the dead. As the departed flow like this river, may their *hun* return to Heaven, their *po* to Earth. For the living, may nurturance abound—blessings vast as the sea, longevity steadfast as mountains.

**Third Morning’s Invocation**
In serving the dead and the living, we fulfill the filial piety due to our honored parents. In revering the end as we revered the beginning, we uphold the solemnity of discipline. Our gratitude ascends to the Nine Heavens; our rites span three days. Completing the Nine Mornings’ Dao, we pray for the illumination of the Eight Luminaries, that our embodied selves may endure. May the names of the departed be inscribed early upon the Cinnabar Terrace’s stone chambers, and their souls find proof of refinement. Through the merit of the Golden Register and White Petitions, may all in darkness and light alike receive deliverance.

**Establishing the Morning Audience**
Heaven’s hearing is never distant; we ever hold our private sincerity in mind. Yet human affairs must end—how can we avoid repeated supplication? Overwhelmed and ashamed, we, the foolish and ignorant, reflect: fortunate to have attained human form, we are ever favored by the Emperor’s gaze, with abundance to our left and right. Knowing how to serve the dead and the living, we rely on the incense of cultivation to perfect this morning audience. We pray that the Eastern Realm of Eternal Joy and the Western Land of Na may both radiate light; that the Northern Springs’ Winding Palace and the Southern Palace of Shangchang may together achieve universal deliverance. May all sentient beings attain transcendence.

**Dispersing the Morning Audience**
The Heavenly Dao defies naming, yet it is wise and luminous. In the order of human relations, filial piety and reverence must come first. We prostrate ourselves, pouring forth our sorrow, lifting our voices to the azure vault. We reflect: dwelling in the Central Land, we share this private devotion. Through the purity of our fast, we fulfill the Way of honoring parents, mindful that though we were nurtured in life, we failed to fully repay their warmth. Alas, the departed flow like this river, and the barrier between light and dark remains. Relying on the merit of this morning audience, we seek to make it a bridge to liberation. May the Emperor’s hearing be moved; may your deeds be recorded, your sins erased, and the people’s sincerity be seen. Extending to the departed, preserving for the living, we pray that all in the underworld may ascend to the shore of the Dao.

Moreover,
The Emperor watches over you—let your heart know no duplicity, as if he stood to your left and right. All people possess constancy, cherishing virtue and honoring parents. We pour forth our crimson sincerity, lifting our voices to the vault of Heaven. We reflect: as children, we ever strive to honor our thoughts—yet the departed are gone like this river, while the living have failed to nurture them. Step by step, we prostrate ourselves, gazing toward Mount Tai to offer our devotion. Thrice we bathe, thrice we burn incense, relying on our revered masters to present our petitions. May the realms of light and dark alike receive the grace of deliverance. In the human realm, may the young grow strong, the old regain their vigor. May the dead be refined, their forms established, their spirits preserved. May all in the underworld attain the fruit of the Dharma.

**A Daughter’s Petition for Her Father**
In the shadowy night’s prison, we lament the nine hells’ depths of suffering. In the dawn’s courtyard, we later behold the five lights’ brilliance. We prostrate ourselves, pouring forth our sincerity, lifting our voices to the pure. We reflect: our father’s flesh has barely cooled, his voice still lingers—how could we, as children, ever forget the Way of serving parents? Fortunate that the Heavenly Worthy has stirred a heart of salvation, responding to cries for aid. Relying on the power of incense and cultivation, we dare express our private gratitude. We pray that the fifty-three years of floating obstacles and hardships may all be erased, that the hundred thousand *qi* of the formless void may be drawn forth. May all sentient beings attain birth and transformation, ascending together to the Great Dao.

Moreover,
The Dao is beyond words—through ten thousand million kalpas, its form defies description. Father, where have you gone? Fifty-three years passed like a fleeting colt. In quiet reflection, who could bear this? We reflect: our father met his end in the dust of this fleeting world. Though his clothing and food were sufficient to ease his brow, and no illness suddenly afflicted him, Heaven is high, Earth distant—who could restore his *po* and summon his *hun*? The moon is cold, frost bitter—who could not weep in sorrow? Relying on this merit, we make it a bridge. Having received deliverance, how could we forget our gratitude? We pray that the Three Officials may swiftly erase his name from the ledgers of sin, uprooting all evil. May the Five Emperors oversee his journey to the Jade Capital, his ascent to the Golden Gates.

Moreover,
Our father’s kindness remains unrepayed—we rely on the merit of deliverance to turn back the Emperor’s wrath. We pray for the stirring of compassion; having received mercy, who would dare forget the source? We reflect: our sins have accumulated upon our person, extending calamity to our father. Though we harbor private grief, we cannot voice it—we can only pray that the Dharma’s form may uphold us. Having bathed our bodies and refined our forms, we have already presented our petition to the Vermilion Mound. Laying bare our livers and gallbladders, we now inscribe these words in jade.

Longing deepens beyond measure, trembling and at a loss.

We humbly pray that ears may hear, sounds may resonate, eyes may see, colors may appear—awakening the mechanism of thought, knowledge, understanding, and enlightenment; that hands may move, feet may dance—attaining the joy of unfettered freedom. May all those in hidden suffering thereby ascend beyond.

Moreover,
As a woman who has taken her path, I once made a plea for his return to peace. The boundless heavens offer no solace—how can I bear this grief of losing my sole support? Bowing low, I pour forth my foolish heart, lifting my gaze to beseech your august presence.

Reflecting, I recall my father’s words were simple, his learning modest. Measured by human affairs, he did no wrong—why then was he forsaken by fate? Six years of confinement left his limbs as though shackled, bringing the twin fiends’ nightmare to his very marrow, or perhaps the Three Corpses’ calamity arose from his torpor. His illness has reached its crisis—who now knows the plan to restore his rest? Here I weep, barely fulfilling the duty of a filial child. Grieving and harboring resentment, I can only lay bare my plea.

Fortunately, in the long kalpas to come, the teachings will endure, so that beneath King Yama’s throne, grievances may be unbound and enmities released. Perhaps through wondrous power, a method to revive life may be offered.

We humbly pray that his marks of excellence may flourish, his karmic bonds from past lives be severed. May all his sins be uprooted, his chronic afflictions and accumulated misfortunes swept away. May he swiftly regain his form and wander the Great Void. May all, in darkness and in light, together attain liberation.

Prostrate, I beseech the August Emperor: though He has not absolved, how could one fail to offer reverence with a humble heart? Without a father, what refuge remains? The youngest daughter’s sorrow is unbearable. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; lifting my gaze, I implore the lofty ear of Heaven.

I recall how my father’s untreatable abscess brought him to death, his flesh not yet cold. Perhaps he appeared in a vision of light, his countenance filled with sorrow—who could cast him aside, unmoved? Who would not plead with deepest urgency? Like Ye Chang, though innocent, he suffered the weight of public judgment; like Zeng Shen, falsely accused of murder, he endured suspicion that could not be dispelled. For three years, grief has weighed upon me; for nine springs, resentment has lingered in the Yellow Springs. Had I not served him with utmost devotion, who would deem his deep wrongs redeemable? I humbly pray that the karma of many lives be pardoned, that he not be bound and pressed into the ranks of ghosts. May the enmities of past ages be released, and from this moment of awakening, may all be aided by the power of the Dao.

Again, prostrate, I reflect: my father’s loss is grievous—how can one endure the sorrow of his death? Though his daughter was wed to a neighbor, she could not fulfill her wish to return and bring him peace. Bowing low, I offer my earnest devotion; lifting my gaze, I disturb the vault of Heaven.

I recall how my father attended to his duties with diligence and managed his household with frugality. Though he had but slightly expanded his fields, he widely extended the intentions of our ancestors. Though his family faced many hardships, he strove to repay the debts of his sons. His kindness remained unrequited, yet my heart holds it deeply. I had hoped that in his later years, he might enjoy good fortune and preserve his life. Yet half his years passed like a bubble’s shadow. After twenty days of illness, the abscess had not yet burst, but his gall had already perished. At the end of four seven-day cycles, his soul might be summoned, but his spirit would not fade. To bow before the Vermilion Mound and cross the threshold of life, one must rely on the Daoist priest to present these words. By the grace of the vast celestial bed, may his past karma be forever absolved, and may he depart the winding paths of the Yellow Springs to awaken to the moment of liberation. Since there is a Heavenly Paradise, may he dwell in the realm of carefree wandering.

Again, prostrate, I lament: my five viscera are torn asunder, yet I must sever my love for my late father. Though a hundred bodies could not repay him, the youngest daughter’s sorrow is unbearable. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; lifting my gaze, I implore the lofty ear of Heaven.

I recall how my father, though his children’s marriages were settled, endured such hardship. His burden never lightened from his shoulders, and illness clung to him like an abscess upon his back. The stars dimmed and fell, breaking my heart like the fleeting lotus of a dream. Days and months passed, and in the blink of an eye, sixty days slipped away. I long to sing the *Summons of the Soul* like Song Yu, yet dare I present the plea of Ti Ying to redeem a crime? I humbly pray that his name be erased from the Black Register, that he may soon receive the Golden Register and White Tablet. May he bow before the Vermilion Mound and be delivered through the fires and waters of the ritual pools. May all who have sunk into suffering together ascend to joy.

**Petition for the Blood Bowl to Deliver the Mother**

Prostrate, I reflect: the Eighty-Four Thousand Kalpas of the Feathered Realm stretch boundless, without shore. The Fifty-Three Buddhas of the Blood Bowl vow to deliver all beings. If one can create such karmic conditions, the merit is inconceivable.

I recall how I, born a woman, once honored my mother’s example. Yet my love for her was like the magpie’s, and I could not repay her as the people of Juqiong did. Forty-nine years have passed—where now is her voice and form? One hundred and six days have flown by like the months and years. How could she not think of me? I must rely on the power of the Buddha to awaken the dream beneath the scholar-tree and enlighten her to past causes, that she may gladly attend the feast of reeds. By this, may the later fruit be perfected, and may she reverently welcome the Three Realms. May all in the ten directions be illuminated, and may the eighteen layers of hell be shattered, each prison opened. Without passing through a hundred million kalpas, may all beings in every kalpa attain deliverance. May her true body be purified, so that no orchid-scented waters are needed to wash her tassels. May her Dharma-eye be opened, so that no golden needle is required to scrape away her film. From this moment onward, may all be made new. May she receive life and nurture, forever free from suffering.

In the court of King Yama, may she indeed receive the grace of Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva. In the Tuṣita Palace, may she join her palms and listen to the teachings of Lady Māyā.

**Petition for the Husband and Daughter**

Prostrate, I reflect: the Most High cherishes life, yet why was his life not granted its full span? Since ancient times, death has been inevitable—yet who pities this departed soul? Beating the earth, I hear no response; calling to Heaven, I make my plea.

I recall how I, knowing my fate to be meager, never found a proper match. I think of my daughter, her mouth still smelling of milk, her ignorance profound, and my husband, whose topknot of hair had barely been tied in gratitude—why was his illness incurable? After only eight days, he perished. What could be done? I am left with lifelong regret. O soul, where have you gone? Forever you return to the endless night.

With utmost sincerity, I offer this blood-written plea, hoping that my feelings may be considered and my sins redeemed.

Reflecting on the weight of merit and virtue, the transmission of talismans is inscribed in golden registers and white missives. Surely father and son ascend together, their names etched upon the jade chambers and cinnabar terraces. May all good destinies share in this grace.

**Prayer for Husband and Child**
Prostrate, I consider: earth stretches far and heaven endures long, yet none hear the suffering of the wronged. Frost chills and the moon gleams—who knows the sorrow of the widowed? I dare not speak at length, yet fear I overstep again.

I recall how I, born through kalpas of suffering, endured these two losses. The joy of our family’s rise faded like ephemeral blossoms; the hope of a full life shattered like a broken mirror. Since length of days is fated, what can I do? I know not the cause of good or ill that brought me to this extremity. Though living and dead are sundered, by merit and virtue one may yet ascend. Let me but express my love for my child and convey my longing for home. Though his voice and form seem present, I can only imagine them in the empty courtyard. Where has his soul gone? I pray he may be delivered to the Crimson Mansion, that even the hidden and shadowed beings may together return to the boundless Mahāyāna.

**Prayer for Father from Child**
Prostrate, I reflect: the August Heaven above watches over all and has not forsaken me. In serving the dead as the living, a filial child and obedient descendant offers all. Deeply ashamed of this humble petition, I fear it borders on excessive reverence.

I recall how I, fortunate to dwell among human relations, barely upheld our family’s legacy. Knowing the source of a spring’s flow, how could I not strive to repay its origin? Moved by the scene before me, I express my longing and remembrance. Though my forebear’s remains rest in the grave, all was guided by the divine. Seizing this opportunity, I humbly accept this ascension and dare not forget to offer thanks. Though his spirit does not return, may it wander the dim and silent realms. Virtue is hard to repay; with this simple rite of supplication, I look up to the Great Dao and extend blessings to the underworld.

**Prayer for Parents**
Prostrate, I consider: how vast is Heaven above—how dare I not offer my utmost loyalty? Even a child in arms loves its parents—who lacks this filial piety? Ashamed to repeat myself, I have already stated my plea.

I recall how we, in deep reflection, ever bear the difficulty of serving the dead as the living. In our conduct toward others and ourselves, we find no virtue or filial piety to praise. Thus, we turn to the Emperor of the Eastern Peak and Mount Tai, praying that all beings may together return to the Great Dao. May all men and women devote themselves wholly, all be protected and delivered, and all attain longevity. May spirits hear these hidden words and ascend, spared from suffering.

**Prayer for Father and Ancestors**
Prostrate, I reflect: the grace of Heaven and Earth is profound, and I bow in gratitude for their nurturing virtue. The crisp air of frost and dew—who does not feel the sorrow of offering mugwort? Humbly, I pour forth my sincerity, prostrating before the Azure Heavens.

I recall how I, bound by worldly dust, possess awareness of blood and breath. I cherish the toil of my father and grandmother, mindful of the teachings like those of Kaoshu. In life, I served them; in death, I buried them—this may be called filial, yet I strive to offer my utmost sincerity. Rising early and retiring late, I do not shame my origins. How shall I repay them? Last winter, I vowed to hold the Great Yellow Register Fast, performing rites of thanksgiving and expressing reverence through posthumous offerings.

I pray that their yellowed forms be purified, their jade eyes refined, and their true precepts followed in the School of Purity and Light. May the Southern Palace’s flying crow and the Northern Bureau’s spirits ascend, their talismanic commands fulfilled in speech.

**Prayer for Ancestors**
Prostrate, I reflect: human relations are rightly ordered, deepening the heart of filial piety. The Dao of Heaven is constant, and we truly bear its nurturing virtue. I prepare the sacred altar and humbly invoke the true healing.

I recall how we, bound by worldly duties, live as descendants. The merit of ancestors and the virtue of our lineage protect us, their descendants—how fortunate! With sincere hearts and earnest intent, we place our trust in the spirits without doubt. Let me briefly express my plea and perform this special rite. Ashamed of my repeated petitions, I yet hope for a fraction of private grace.

I pray that the Nine Dark Realms open the way, holding the texts of the Yellow Register. May the Eight Radiant Scenes shine forth, and may we behold the golden-purple visage. Further, I beseech blessings upon our descendants and grace upon the living.

**Prayer of the Perfected One Seeking Forgiveness**
I have heard that humans, as the most enlightened of beings, knowing their faults, must correct them. Spirits leave no trace for judgment—how can one call them wrong? Yet why do they act wrongly? It is because they rely on humans to act, and thus cannot escape the flattery of ghosts.

I, your servant, hold a sacred office in the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens. Since the Kaiyun era, my shrine has received offerings. From the Kaixi era onward, my temple has been honored with imperial decrees. Though I possess the numinous power of grass and trees, I know not the wonder of ascending as a saint or perfected one. Thus, I have observed fasts, upheld precepts, accumulated goodness, and built merit, advancing to the ranks of immortals. I have been entrusted with duties in the unseen realm, performing my tasks with care—how slight my virtue!

Yet I fear that in using medicine to save lives, I may not distinguish the properties of *aconite* and *cinnamon*, *magnolia* and *poria*. In using literature to exhort the world, I may not recognize the errors of *Lu*, the foolish, *Hai*, or *Cheng*. Or in divination, I may fail to deliver the oracle. Or like the wild goose, I may not find rest. I may pray for clear skies, only to bring rain, turning crops to ruin in the summer heat. Or I may pray for rain, only to bring drought, incurring blame from the Wind Earl. Some say good and evil have their retribution—yet why does good not bring good, and evil not evil, like the vanished state of Guo? Or that fortune and misfortune move people—yet why does fortune not bring fortune, and misfortune not misfortune, like the horse of the old man of the frontier?

Some die young, not by fate, misled by shamans’ words into slander. Some live in poverty and hardship, blamed on ghosts’ deceit, unable to rise. Some village festivals involve offerings of meat and wine, violating the precepts. Some communal feasts borrow kitchens, offending the fast. Thus, *chimei* and *wangliang* seize the opportunity to ride their *men* carts, while the sins of *taotie* and those who pray with peach wood have no escape.

In deep anxiety and fear, I tremble uncontrollably. Fortunately, the Most High has sworn a vow of compassion, and the Great Dao provides rites of repentance. Humbly, I stand before the sacred presence and confess my failings.

I humbly beseech the renewal of the old and the proclamation of amnesty for calamities. May past transgressions of reckless words be redeemed, and future diligence in service be demanded, that all may be pacified.

In governance, I dare not stir up trouble, nor seek merit through toil and hardship. In personal conduct, I dare not hold office without earning my keep. To succor the living and deliver the dead, to aid the upright and expel the wicked—I shall exert myself in practice and repay with utmost loyalty.

Moreover, I hope that my person may enter the radiance of the precious pearl, and my every step fulfill the Three Thousand Precepts. Though my virtue lacks the fragrance of millet and rice, may my sacrifices endure for a hundred generations. The devotion of your servant is boundless, earnest to the utmost.

**Thanksgiving for the Bestowal of the Title "Perfected"**

I prostrate myself before the majestic lineage of the Great Dao, to which my heart wholly turns in reverence. From the vast expanse of the Great Luo above, the Three Realms all bear witness. How profound is the Celestial Emperor’s favor, and how unfailing the wisdom of the divine beings!

Reflecting on my joy, which shook the earth, and the grace that descended from heaven—though ranks are apportioned with distinction, I know my sixteen-character title exceeds all bounds. Where rites grow excessive, disorder follows; I deeply fear the full measure of the thousand-two-hundred-part cycle. Yet through broad consultation, all concur it is both fine and fitting.

Thus, I offer the reverence of fasting and purification to express my private gratitude. I humbly pray that in receiving emoluments, I may benefit the people, and that my yang merits be made manifest. Show me the path of illustrious virtue, and bestow further honor upon my yin office.

**Again,**

Heaven’s constancy favors those with virtue; without virtue, one cannot move Heaven. The sage does not claim to know the divine, yet only the divine may enter the sage. With sincerity, I bow and lift my gaze to the azure vault.

I recall that my homeland lies beneath the shade of mulberry and elm, bound in communal kinship. The title "Spiritual Relief" has endured for over four hundred years, and its boundless benevolence has been revealed to all under heaven. The people, content in their sufficiency, cherish it without end. Thus, the favor bestowed upon the master has grown ever greater. Gathering the feathered and robed, I prepare humble offerings, pledge alliance with the Three Realms, and dare not betray the grace of former days. Through the grand Rite of Thanksgiving to the Heavenly Net, I may perhaps express this heartfelt reverence. I further hope for your radiant presence at the ritual seat, that blessings may be conferred upon all people.

**Prayer for the Protection of Crops**

Heaven does not speak, yet its goodness responds—when it is said to rain, rain comes in its season. When people desire and follow, blessings sought arrive in full. With sincerity, I bow and lift my gaze to the azure vault.

I recall that my humble abode shelters beneath the vast turning of the cosmos, like a swallow nesting in a tent’s eaves. Should I ever fail in reverence, I shall surely correct my faults. My plea is not for external gain but only to avert disaster. Since I have already received abundant grace, I still pray for its fulfillment. Having been touched by this favor, how can I ever rest in ease? I shall ever hold the fear and trembling of one who has received much. I beg for your compassion and dare not forget to repay your virtue.

I pray that the young grow strong and the old remain vigorous, that men and women alike may thrive. May the lowlands know no dampness, the heights no drought, and may all be filled with abundance.

**Again,**

The people regard food as heaven; I deeply fear that Heaven’s heart may send down reproach. Even when the Xia prayed for grain from the thousand gods, they still hoped the Emperor’s wrath might be turned away. Below, I lead the people’s sentiments; above, I appeal to Heaven’s hearing.

I recall that we, who look up in service and down in nurture, are many in number. From spring plowing to autumn harvest, the year’s labor nears completion, and we hope for abundant fields and plentiful crops. Yet if pests or minor blights arise, how can we atone through our offerings? Only by removing harm can benefit flourish; only by doing good can auspicious omens descend.

May the wind blow gently, the clouds gather lightly—thus shall the vegetables and salted offerings be presented. May the harvest be reaped in abundance, the grain piled high—thus shall the millet and rice be fittingly offered.

*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Ten Concludes*
*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Eleven*

**Proclamation for the Establishment of the Luotian Jiao Ritual, Issued by the Golden Portal’s Conferral of Immortal Writs**

From the Three Heavens’ Gate, the Perfected of the Golden Portal’s Palace, charged with the authority of the Heavenly Mechanism’s Secretariat and the office of Wenchang’s Minister of Fortune, whose radiance ascends to the heavens and whose auspicious responses manifest among men:

Now, man is the spirit of the myriad things, his nature endowed with the Five Constants. Fathers, in their kindness, instruct—how could this depend on the carving of wheels? Sons, in their filiality, admonish—how much more do they honor the towering trees of their forebears. Elder and younger brothers, like the *chi* and *xun* flutes, take turns sounding the harmony of the household’s zither. True friendship, rooted in heartfelt exchange, is praised like the clans of Xiao, Zhu, Wang, and Gong. When righteousness runs deep, it is revered like the bonds of Xing, Jin, Ying, and Han. Such is the foundation of moral instruction, the unshakable pillar of human relations.

Let none oppress the weak with strength, nor overwhelm the few with the many. Let none neglect kin for strangers, nor allow the lowly to surpass the noble. When the cap of the superior and the sandals of the inferior remain in their rightful places, when names and ranks are preserved, then the scales of justice will be balanced, and great peace may be hoped for. Then shall culture and renown flourish—could this be mere jade, silk, bells, or drums?

To propagate transformation and uphold the current, one must embody Heaven’s Dao to bring blessings. To observe customs and examine mores, one must apply effort in human affairs. As for the promotion or demotion of the unseen and the manifest, rewards and punishments must be certain. Among those who oversee the city gods and earthly spirits, some may quell disasters of water and fire, some may bring rain and sunshine in due season, some may settle the wild geese in peace, and some may cause the tortoise and milfoil to speak. Where virtue is worthy of praise and merit is recorded, they shall be publicly recommended and duly promoted. But if they are dull-witted and unresponsive, if they fawn like false ghosts, if they cling to corrupt customs and are called licentious, if their foul deeds are notorious yet they refuse to reform—then they have brought calamity upon themselves, and disaster shall befall their persons. This office, having investigated and verified, shall on that very day enact thorough reforms.

Apart from the memorial already submitted to the True Bureau of the Three Realms and the City God, this proclamation is hereby issued for public notice.

**Proclamation for the Jade Palace’s Conferral of the Immortal Tablet and the Grand Offering of the Luo Heaven**

To the Three Heavenly Gates, the Perfected of the Jade Palace, who currently hold office—once appointed as Recorder of the Thunder Bureau’s Mysterious Ministry, once as the Supreme Minister of Longevity in the Southern Culmen—harmonizing the myriad transformations and governing the care of all living beings.

Wind to nourish the people, rain to nourish the people, regulating cold and heat, yin and yang in balanced order. Clothing to clothe us, food to feed us, ensuring mulberry and hemp, grain and millet bring abundance and prosperity. When forms are knit, men chant reverence, women chant devotion. When spirits descend, the moon becomes the essence, the sun the soul. Each has its office, each its appointed duty, fortunate to attain liberation through karmic conditions. Embodying the Dao and virtue to shed radiant light, enabling Yang Zhen to transmit purity and integrity through his lineage. Thus, Bi must surely regain his rank as lord and marquis—what wisdom may grasp, folly cannot, for what is granted by man is also granted by Heaven.

As for prayers for rain or sunshine, one may move unseen through heaven and earth. The Minister of Agriculture oversees the harvest, the Director of Silks manages hemp and flax—each holds their rightful post. The Market Official regulates commerce, the Artisan Inspector refines materials—none neglect their duties. Yet if one follows deviant paths, failing to reflect on the root, allowing demons and malevolence to arise and inflict harm, this is the bitter brew you have brewed yourself—though you may repent, can it be undone?

Whether the spirits of *chimei* and *wangliang* run rampant, spreading poison, or the monstrous *taotie* and *taowu* perpetuate treachery and deceit, this office shall never conceal or tolerate such acts. By law, we shall act, ensuring that in the yang realm, the guilty face the punishment of dismemberment, and in the yin realm, their forms are shattered to pieces. We shall sever them with the wind-knife, strike them with the thunder-axe—what man may kill, Heaven shall condemn. Whose fault is this, if not your own?

Moreover, this office has sworn to aid the upright and eradicate the perverse, to succor the living and deliver the dead. Now, filial sons and obedient grandsons, having turned their hearts toward the Dao, first enable their countless ancestors—from parents to great-great-grandparents—to ascend according to their vows. And for the lonely souls and stagnant spirits of the Five Ancient Paths and Three Wretched Realms, though long sunk in suffering, all shall partake in the grace of Heaven.

Apart from the memorial already submitted to the True Bureau of the Three Realms and the City God, this proclamation is hereby issued for public notice.

**Proclamation of the Bestowal of Honors and Transmission to the Upper Mystery Gate**

We humbly consider: the Nine Qi abide within the Cavernous Mystery, guarded by the divine. The boundless multitudes of the Ten Directions arrive upon the void. They attend our august presence, bearing witness to the Great Dao. Incense rises in clouds, thick and fragrant; lamps intermingle with the radiance of stars and moon. From afar, we govern the Nine Heavens, solemnly conducting the Three Offerings. With utmost reverence, we serve the Celestial Emperor—how awe-inspiring!

The divine, vast and responsive, fulfill their duties. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, all receive deliverance. The realm is at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony. Let all officials under your charge attend diligently to their posts.

We invoke the numinous waters of the Most High, recite the jade texts of the Primordial Beginning. The Five Emperors attend the Perfected, the viscera grow cool and clear. The nation is at ease, the people cultivate simplicity, and all demons withdraw in silence. Ghostly spirits vanish, malevolence subsides. Let this be made known—may all take heed.

Thus, the proclamation is issued.

**Notice to the Patron of the Retreat, Drafted on Behalf of the High Priest**

It is said: there is life, and there is death—life and death follow separate paths. Yet to serve the dead as one serves the living is to unite death and life as one. As descendants, how can one lack humaneness? Moreover, this body, this form, was not born among the mulberry trees, nor were your father and mother ever cast upon the waters. If you understand this, how can you not reflect?

Staging colorful performances in the hall—today’s so-called "old vegetables"—how countless they are! Weeping in grief by the roadside—today’s so-called "Gao Yu"—are there none among them? One should sip bean broth and drink water, fulfilling the joy of filial devotion. Why must one, like a dried fish tied with rope, harbor endless regret?

Better a cup of spring wine than slaughtering oxen for an extravagant burial. Though you may grieve that the wind and trees never cease, rejoice that heaven and man have this meeting. By observing the retreat and upholding the precepts thus, one may revive the dead and restore the bones—those who accept their lot.

If ancestors cherish their grandsons with love, how can descendants lack the awareness to reciprocate? Uncles are praised—why wait for the day of gathering pearls? Nephews are not fools—why must they ride in procession on horseback to care for their orphans? Ever mindful of their elder brothers’ lineage, they shelter their descendants; ever pitying their younger brothers’ early deaths, they nurture their offspring.

Whether in the joy of wedding cups or the sorrow of a broken lute, whether in the oaths of shaved heads or the delight of raised brows, as husband and wife, predestined by past lives—through life and death, true affection is revealed. These are the greatest of human bonds, upon which the teachings of propriety depend.

Though still in infancy, none fail to love their parents. We rely upon the Supreme Emperor, who possesses the virtue of cherishing life. Vastly opening the path of deliverance, both the living and the dead benefit. Now, in observance of the Zhongyuan Festival’s continuation of the Xuandu tradition, we reverently join the assembly in establishing the karmic conditions for universal deliverance.

Let good men and good women each awaken their virtuous hearts. Whether near or far, all shall be naturally unobstructed. The merit is extraordinary—merit beyond thought, inconceivable.

We look up to the retreat’s patron, who deigns to attend the ritual seat. Though you have turned toward the Dao, you also possess a filial and obedient heart. The earth has no prisons, yet Heaven has its halls—separated by no more than a foot’s distance. Good deeds accumulate like mountains, evil runs deep as the sea—even a slight deviation may lead to vast disparity.

Those who do not understand me—what do you seek? You must seek within yourself. I, so-and-so, a humble student of the Heavenly Abode, presumptuously preside over the mysteries of the Dao. Were it not for the presence of the sacred and the drawing of lots, how dare I affix my name and title? Though I lack the capacity to deliver others, I only follow the Dao in my conduct.

Should any in this altar fail in loyalty, the luminous statutes shall impose their penalties. Without addition or omission, let none act with deceitful intent—only with a sincere heart and upright will may merit be fulfilled and virtue perfected.

Thus, thus.
Know this, know this.

Amidst the myriad generations of ancestors, names inscribed in the registers of immortals, each spanning five kalpas of opportune convergence. The six relations and nine clans, names recorded in the realm of longevity, where eight thousand years pass as spring and autumn. This is hereby respectfully reported for your collective understanding.

Thus, the decree is issued.
**Decree to the Faithful Assembled at the Altar**

Now, as the season of early autumn arrives and the Zhongyuan Festival draws near, when the White Emperor governs the turning of time and the Earth Official conducts his reckoning, Buddhists on this day offer the Ullambana basin, while Daoists establish the Mystic Capital Offering. Though our gates differ and our households diverge, the principle remains one while the rites vary—each striving to transform the people and perfect customs, each holding filial devotion and ancestral reverence in mind. At such a time, how can one not reflect?

Vast is the heavens, its qi pure and clear.
The grasses [sway] softly, the people hushed and still.
Gazing at the bright moon over Dongting, why wear sorrow like a sash?
Singing of the crisp wind at Red Cliff, why weep and wail thus?

I turn to my shadow and sigh,
my heart grieved, my breath heavy.
This body, this hair and skin—bequeathed by my father and mother—how shall I repay them?
The fields and homes, the clothing and food of my parents—accumulated virtue of my ancestors—how shall I repay them?

My ancestor, the Grand Mentor Xie, his admonitions—what day dare I forget?
My uncle, Minister Xue, his parted wealth—his kindness was not small.
The line *"Ponds grow grass"*—this is why Xie of Linchuan dreamed of his brother.
The passage *"Offering water-plants"* in the *Spring and Autumn*—this is why Han Changli longed for his elder brother.

Yet when the younger sister of Yuanwai passed, why begrudge the carved stone?
When the younger sister of Huang the Grand Historian died, why resent the shattered wall?
Striking the basin and singing, how hard to sever the love of Zhuangzi’s garden.
Swearing vows upon the boat, how could she break the pact of Gong Jiang’s alliance?

What heart is this? What heart indeed?
They are human, and I too am human.
Pondering this, what can one say?

The long night stretches on—deceitfully performing the rites of summoning the soul and calling back the spirit.
The Great Lofty Realm is distant—yet fortunately, there exists the method to revive the dead and restore the body.

You, such people, should vow to cultivate all good fruits and plant this noble cause. Moreover, as the kalpa nears its end, twelve myriad souls shall be chosen to fill the ranks of immortals. Now, with merits and virtues fulfilled, I wish to deliver over seven hundred names—men and women of this assembly—so their souls may ascend to the Realm of Non-Action, their wheel of rebirth unbroken.

Yet if any harbor deceit within while feigning purity without, forsaking righteousness and forgetting gratitude, corrupting customs and undermining teachings, scorning the Three Treasures and neglecting the Five Constants—how could such people escape karmic retribution?

Some, once poor and later wealthy, now shamefully conceal their past.
Others, once rich and later poor, now resent their forebears.
As for their ancestors, their clans, their fathers, their mothers, their uncles, their elder brothers, their wives, their husbands, their younger sisters, their sisters-in-law—abandoning mourning rites, treating kin like strangers, as if deaf and blind. Worse still, they share no more care than horses and oxen, utterly devoid of sorrow, content to herd with deer and swine. Thus, the Yang and Ruo’ao clans, left with no lineage to rely upon—do they not feel shame before the sons of horse-doctors and field laborers?

Only I open the gate of expedient means, establishing for you this assembly of equality. Without obstruction, let us together plant the seeds of good affinity.

Let those already born and yet unborn never forsake compassion, adapting to circumstances and responding to transformations. Let those with kin and without, with equal loving-kindness, turn strangers into family, together attending the feast, ascending as one into the Dharma-realm. May your hearts open to awakening, free from greed, anger, and delusion. Let the Dao harmonize with nature, guiding all—from ghostly realms and human paths—back to the immortal Way. These words are no falsehood; do not treat them as mere commonplace.

**Notice of Appointment to the Hall of Masters**
With reverence serve the Dao, ever mindful of the solemnity of fasting, purification, and ablution. Let those who lead by virtue be your teachers, each fulfilling their duties in conduct and demeanor. Vast and ever-present, majestic in spirit—though unseen and unheard, beyond naming or discussion. Be earnest in devotion, respectful in chaos, ever vigilant in your actions. According to the golden registers and their jade precepts, the system of ranks and duties comprises six disciplines. The three grades of examination you know well; let sincerity be your measure. As one asks the servant about plowing, consult the maidservant on matters of knowledge. No bribes shall suffice—only those of proven ability share the carriage, only the worthy the same boat. Attend to your duties, uphold your stations.

This is addressed to you all—such is your own cultivation. You must refine your bearing to inspire admiration. Those who heed this shall enjoy blessings; those who hear it shall ascend [to higher realms]. Let unity of virtue prevail; even a single lapse cannot be tolerated. Should any transgression arise, the responsibility for correction rests with all—three admonitions followed by three bows. Reverently observe the prohibitions, receive the registers, and restore the images. Sever wrongdoing, continue merit—neither reward too lightly nor punish too severely. Do not fret over undeserved gains, nor claim unearned success. As the saying goes: "Without forethought, it begins with you, and returns to you." Merit and virtue are of utmost weight—here they begin, here they end.

Let all who hear this take heed and comply in body and spirit.

**Notice**
The establishment of teachings and statutes serves as guidance for all. In this world, offices and duties rely on those of trusted heart. Though we appoint from among the known, true talent must first be tested. Gather all without discrimination—cast aside neither a copper coin nor an inch of iron, nor neglect the worthy. Banish the wicked as one wields a sharp plowshare; recognize the dullness of a leaden blade. The six offices and six duties demand unity of heart and purpose. Let no past grudges linger, nor old missteps be repeated. Who is without fault? Yet those who correct their errors are true. The state upholds justice, even as it allows redemption. Ever vigilant, ever consistent—depart with announcement, return with report, as dutiful as to one’s parents. Report by merit, test by word, for the proper order of ruler and subject is thus.

**Proclamation for the Yellow Register Universal Salvation Retreat**
Vast and unfathomable—such is the sage, such is the divine. Radiant and manifest, ever present to left and right. Uprightness is their virtue; salvation their work. Looking up, we revere the boundless compassion of the Most High; looking down, we heed the decrees of our office. With utmost solemnity, we undertake this great endeavor as witness.

Long have we gazed upon the walls of Confucius’ temple; now we borrow the mat of Chen Fan. The spirits declare their return, wishing to enter the gate of cultivation. The retreat orders them; special mats are prepared. Let their faces bear joy, not the distress of the oppressed. Summon them, and they come—let them advance in succession, filling the hall to its narrowest corners. Welcome the familiar as old friends, the new as if long known—this is a once-in-a-millennium gathering. Let the distant come, the near rejoice; why distinguish between this realm and that? Some discuss the seasons’ cold and warmth, others the bonds of kinship—laughter fills the hall, hands join in song. What are ghosts, if not kin? All are human here.

Spread the mat and share the meal; coarse grain is no shame. If private devotions to the Buddha arise, let them be conveyed. Should one not know where to dwell, is that not neglect of their abode? Choose guests with courtesy, deeply grateful for the love of the host, the Sage of the Eastern Way. Those souls selected for salvation shall together journey to the Western Kingdom of Vaisravana.

**Notice for the Altar Wardens**
Prostrate before the three tiers, symbolizing the Three Powers, ascending and descending with solemnity. The eight directions correspond to the eight trigrams, arranged with strict precision. Stars form the weft, constellations the warp; heaven has its gates, earth its doors. Crimson cords stretch seventy-two zhang, charting the lunar cycles’ flow. Eighty-one poles are gathered, uniting the transformations of yang’s mysteries. The characters on the banner are as large as bushels; the floating canopy’s structure rises like a chamber. Light pierces the gates of heaven; incense strikes the pillars, filling the air with fragrance. Thunder Lords drive back intruders; Wind Lords wield their mighty fans. The gods, silent and steadfast, uphold the tilting; the Emperor, vast and majestic, presides above.

Should any demonic forces—be they *kuí*, *xū*, *yù*, or *kuáng*, or the malevolent *chīmèi wǎngliǎng*—dare to act with deceit or spread filth, they shall be met with the unyielding law of the Mysterious and unforgiven. Like shadows caught, voices seized—let them be snared as in a net that leaves no rabbit free. Sever their forms, cut off their heads as an axe levels a wasp’s waist. Exterminate their leaders, root out their followers without mercy. Let the frost’s night be as still as withered orchids; let no wildfire rage to consume both thistle and lingzhi. Transform sand and gravel into southern gold, turn tiles and stones into harmonious jade. In the center of the sacred scriptures’ target, let no beast remain unscathed.

Yet how could the gods of the altar, who pluck cicadas with ease, deem their arts too meager? Those with office and duty, with the weight of words, must hold no bias, no private grudges. Guard the Dao with severity, manifest the altar’s clarity. Let ghosts be ominous, immortals auspicious—so it is said of the desire-realm’s flight through the void. Let heaven be free of haze, earth of dust, as we raise the hidden words of the Great Brahma.

In conducting the retreat and practicing the Dao, boundless merit is accrued. Saving the living, delivering the dead—this is the great affinity. Let all faithful men and women attending the assembly offer utmost reverence and devotion. Should any willfully violate the retreat’s precepts or transgress its prohibitions, they bring calamity upon themselves.

How could one dismiss the talismans as mere ornamental writings hung upon the wall? These are the very duties of the altar’s overseers. Thus it is, thus it is. Reverent! Reverent indeed!

**Proclamation to the Generals and Officers of the Altar:**

We have heard that the merit of courtly worship, traced to its origin, began with Attendant Kang of the Capital Bureau. Through such acts, one repays the toil and kindness of parents, thereby attaining the Dao—such filial piety and righteousness defy full expression. Later generations established rites for the living and the dead based on this precedent, and when examining merits, none surpass this as the foremost principle.

Moreover, every person possesses understanding: who is without parents, without uncles and aunts, without siblings, without spouse, without children or nephews? Who does not hold their own body and limbs in highest regard? The living all wish to fulfill their natural lifespan without harm, while the dead all long to return to life, for dry bones to rise as flesh. Without this merit, none can be delivered.

Today, on behalf of [Name] and the assembly, we conclude the retreat. Previously, on the journey of courtly worship, we prepared the yellow registers and petition slips to deliver both the living and the dead. The night-long fast and rite were held to cultivate and exalt this merit. The details are manifold, and without you, Generals and Officers, who would bear witness? Without you, who would transmit the talismans and circulate the decrees? Without you, who would present the memorials and convey the petitions? Without you, who would summon the wandering souls and restore the scattered spirits?

You, Generals and Masters, stationed before the altar—if they serve as the charioteer, then you are the left; if you serve as the charioteer, then they are the right. Equal in merit, one in body, each must attend to your duties with reverence. Boast not of your goodness, nor claim undue labor. Let the living each fulfill their lives, ascending together to the realm of benevolence and longevity; let the dead each find their rest, wandering together in the heavens of bliss. Both living and dead receive this grace, and all will raise their hands to their brows, declaring: “This is the merit of you, Generals and Officers!”

On the day your merit is recognized, your names shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. These are the secret words of the Most High—there is no falsehood in them.

Should there be those who are inauspicious, disobedient, reckless, irreverent, unrighteous, treacherous, or deceitful—who willfully violate these precepts, defiling virtue until their transgressions reach Heaven—you shall, in accordance with the Mysterious Law, utterly eradicate them without exception.

Thus, exhort yourselves, Generals and Officers! Be diligent and steadfast!

**Proclamation.** Again...

The Palace hereby establishes the Zhongyuan Mysterious Capital Retreat and Offering, and all commissioned generals and officers must conduct themselves with lowered voices and solemn reverence, adhering strictly to the precepts. All proclamations to be issued shall proceed as follows.

Prostrate, we acknowledge that the Dao abides in the Great Void, formless and ineffable. Yet when summoned from one’s own primordial destiny, it arrives without delay. The Perfected Ones enforce prohibitions—without proper ritual, it will not act. The talismans of the Numinous Treasure universally proclaim the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Beginning’s *Red Writ* unfolds its myriad regulations. It spreads the five qi of the Five Dragon Divine Waters, coalescing them into numinous power. Wind gathers and smoke summons the Four Spirit Fire-Horses from the four directions, arriving like fine rain or dense mist.

City Gods, attend in reverence: I command the Demon Kings to guard my chariot, raising the Great Unity’s mighty standard and brandishing spears at the Fiery Gate. Let the *xi* and *wangliang* lurk in concealment; let the *chimei*, *shaokui*, and *xuyu* be swept away, and the mad *xuyu* subdued. The maidens of Wu Gorge shall find no place to cast their covetous gazes. The followers of Chiyou shall ultimately be reduced to withered bones.

To all assembled: heed this proclamation, and do not invite defilement to entangle you in guilt. Should any act thus, none shall escape destruction. Reflect thrice—though repentance may come, what use is it then? Uphold the Mysterious Law, and consign the wicked to the crooked and perverse. Sever heads and dismember forms, all to be boiled like dragons. Seize by sound and shadow—none shall slip through the net. Those who hear this tremble in terror; those who see it quake in submission.

To break one’s word is to forsake trust; guard the Dao with severity. Let the Ten Mysteries unfurl and the Eight Effulgences shine forth. May the Three Realms assemble in unison, and the host of Perfected Ones oversee the deliverance. Strike left to the left, strike right to the right. You shall serve as Upright Generals of Dharma Protection. Neither lag behind nor rush ahead—you shall act as Impartial Envoys of Retreat Supervision. Attend to your duties with reverence, unite your hearts as one, and remain steadfast from beginning to end. Such merit is of the highest order, sufficient above to offer to the Seven Ancestral Shrines, and below to deliver the multitudes from the Three Wretched Realms.

We further pray that Heaven, attaining the One, may be purified, and Earth, attaining the One, may be pacified. In harmony with the divine, the demonic path shall ever be inauspicious, while the immortal path shall ever be auspicious. Thus shall I endure long—heed these commands without error or deviation.

**Proclamation.** Again...

Beneath the Three Heavenly Gates, the appointed officers of the Golden and Jade Towers of the Perfected Ones’ Palaces, having received the reverent investiture of jade seals and been favored with the Master’s grace, now stand in awe. All eyes behold them with astonishment, for their solitary traces seldom stir such wonder. Though they attend to their duties with diligence, their merit must be weighed by the sincerity of their own hearts. Ten eyes gaze upon them, ten hands point toward them—none can escape the impartial judgment of right and wrong, good and evil.

To walk alone is difficult; to clap with a single hand is impossible. They must rely upon the strategies of civil and martial deployment. Next, to all the generals and officials arrayed around them—radiant to left and right, resplendent in might and spirit—who emerge from being and vanish into non-being, who appear before the eyes only to suddenly linger behind, whose past glory is recorded in the annals of history and whose literary brilliance is still heard today: now, their heroic souls exhaust their utmost loyalty, upon which Heaven and Earth depend for their very standing.

When the talisman arrives, receive its command in silence. Craftsmen adhere to compass and square; physicians distinguish ginseng from poria. First take the long, then the short. Servants till the fields; maidservants tend the hearth. They offer their strength; these offer their labor. Each cherishes the joy of the mulberry’s shade—how could it be said that their sustenance is without benefit? In rank, they respond to all things like the resonance of the Yellow Bell, every movement producing sound. They dispel entanglements like a blade newly sharpened on the whetstone, every use free from obstruction.

Let none treat one another as distant as Chu and Yue, for they must rely upon the loyalty of heart and mind like Zhang Liang and Chen Ping. Exterminate demonic forces, and the city gods shall heed their commands. Rescue and deliver all beings, embodying the Supreme’s love for life. Should any hidden spirits dare violate these prohibitions, they shall be judged according to the statutes and publicly subjected to the prescribed punishments.

Those beyond the bounds are called traitors, and the *Yu Dian* provides for their governance by the Ministry of Justice. Those who defy and resist shall face the executioner’s blade as recorded in the *Book of Zhou*. Guard the village gates, pacify the altars of soil and grain, and ensure that every person attains their desires, fulfilling the wish for ease and contentment, that every household enjoys abundance and prosperity.

You shall not boast of your virtues or display your toils—it is I who shall assess merit and dispense rewards. Offer the finest grains of ritual with reverence; do not bring shame upon the divine. Before the incense and flame, first pray for the longevity of the Son of Heaven. Each shall attend to their duties and not neglect their posts.

**Proclamation.** Again...

Let cinnabar tablets, cinnabar, green lingzhi, and red arrowroot be gathered by physicians. Great beams, small rafters, refined eaves, and short ladders rely entirely on the craft of carpenters. Having refined what is selected, each shall be measured according to its material.

Proclamation to the Generals of the Upright Altar and the Inspectors of Ritual Offerings: harmonize like sounds, seek out like kinds. Let your forms be truly upright, your voices truly clear. Serve as guardians to the Four Numinous Beasts, repelling enemies from a thousand *li*, striking terror into the hearts of foxes and jackals. Display the might of wolves and tigers blocking the path, leaving cunning hares at their wits’ end. Embody the power of tigers and leopards in the mountains—be virtuous and invincible.

When employed, act; when matters arise, command—abide by my prohibitions. Should any subordinate official dare to summon malevolent spirits, recklessly indulge in madness, or willfully defile, they shall be cut down and eradicated like foxes and rats clinging to a banner’s tassels. Some shall be released, some seized, like chicks within a cage—judged with weight or lightness, with impartial right and wrong. Do not let sacred fungi mingle with rotten weeds, nor auspicious birds with common feathers.

The celestial statutes are most precise—report any violations at once. Now seal the mud pellet, spread the ritual mat, and reverently welcome the imperial carriage in its stately procession, receiving the Emperor’s graceful arrival. Some shall raise the great banner before and plant the tiger standard behind; others shall wield the white tassel in the right hand and brandish the yellow battle-axe in the left.

Let none transgress these commands; align your hearts as one, and in your efforts, go beyond the measure. When merit is weighed for reward, no stinting shall there be. When virtue and achievement are complete, your names shall be inscribed among the stellar generals of the Southern Palace. Longevity, prosperity, and peace shall answer in part the hopes of the eastern host.

By this proclamation, let all be made known.

**Notice.**

Moreover, in the administration of ordinances: Those who cultivate hidden virtue shall surely receive manifest reward; those who practice open virtue shall surely attain illustrious renown. Now the Nine Heavens’ Two Perfected Ones have ascended to the ranks of immortals, their offices arrayed among the Nine Heavens. Can the virtue they hold in human hearts be measured? You, officers and generals, may see them with your eyes, hear them with your ears, and engage them in speech—no doubt remains, no uncertainty lingers. Therefore, you must unite your hearts and pool your strength to assist in the completion of this work.

Should there be treacherous and deceitful men, ghosts or goblins, inauspicious and perverse, insolent and irreverent, defiling themselves with filth—know that I shall execute Heaven’s punishment through you. The lightly guilty shall be seized and brought before the Celestial Pivot; the heavily guilty shall be dismembered and beheaded. Thus shall Heaven attain unity and clarity, Earth attain unity and tranquility, and the gods attain unity and numinosity.

When the day of merit arrives, I shall memorialize the Celestial Court on your behalf, that you may be appointed to the scattered offices of the immortal bureaucracy—how could you remain mere banners and drums for mortal eyes and ears? Yet if the left fails to strike on the left, or the right fails to strike on the right, and you disobey these commands, the fault shall be yours alone. The Perfected Ones, as celestial generals, shall have cause to reproach you—this is the hundred-times-tempered steel, daily sharpened to slice a thousand oxen, sheathed and stored, yet not my shame.

Let all take heed to these words.

**Notice.**

**Notice to the Five Marshals of the Boundless Realms—Wei, Zhao, and Diao**

Behold: bright moon and white dew, the passing of time—who among us is without the sorrow of withered grasses and desolate winds? Let all beneath the August Heaven and Earth, all gods above and below, offer reverent sincerity, upright and balanced, and by this karmic connection, cultivate merit and virtue.

Now, within this Daoist sanctuary, rites are prepared in purity. First, we address the pressing concern of those departed souls who have fallen into the three wretched paths, the bitter destinies, with no means of escape—how then may they ascend? Though officials exist to oversee such matters, do they bear no burden of reproach?

We summon you, warriors fierce as *pixiu*, to render service swift as hawks and hounds. On my decree, come forth at once. Soar through the void, transform at will, emerge from nothingness into being, and traverse every shadowed yin realm, every place of gathering. There, you shall summon the souls to be delivered at this assembly, escorting them here. Proclaim to them:

The primal might of tigers and leopards cannot long endure in confinement—thus sings the *Zhao Te* of Huainan’s Xiao Mountain.
The belly of the river fish is no place for lingering delay—thus intones the *Diao Hun* of the Changsha Grand Tradition.

Whose ode shall we raise to praise the banners of the learned?
Who shall sing the verses that revive the bleached bones of Xianyang upon the battlefield?
Who shall loose the bound spirits of Changping, their nineteen years of woolen garments now worn to naught?
Did Su Wu truly receive the wild goose’s message? A thousand years later, the marble pillar still stands.
Was Ding Lingwei truly a crane? Yet Zhang Han’s longing for water shield and perch stirred his heart, just as Tao Yuanming grieved for his pines and chrysanthemums.

O souls! O souls! Return to your former abodes.
The hour is now! The hour is now! Do not let it slip away.
From this moment onward, all shall be made new.
Look up and receive compassion; look down and find pardon.

The golden rooster is set before the gate, its augury already declared.
The courier stars streak past—no wolfish hearts, no wild ambitions remain.
The stubborn and unenlightened shall be transformed, their debts repaid like oxen at the butcher’s block.
The jailers shall follow the writs of judgment.
Though bound in fetters, they are not guilty.
Yet let the sight of their tattered robes shame the people—hold them no longer; release them all.

The Dharma’s gate offers expedient means—who would scheme like a thief to cross its threshold?
The immortal path is free and unbounded—who would feign the folly of Zu and Yu to deceive their way?
The world is vast—where else would these souls wander?
The scholar Niu lost his way in delusion—was Bo Ji truly a seductive phantom?
The old man drunk on the road—did Fu Qi dare stir mischief?

Let none be trapped in the schemes of Chen and Cai, nor hindered by the obstructions of Zang and Cang.
Should any petty ghosts act recklessly, you are to obey the Mysterious Law, seize them, and bring them forth.

Go forth and heed these commands.
When the day of merit comes, your names shall be inscribed in Heaven. You shall serve as attendants across the Three Realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors—this is no humble station.
The Nine Dark Realms shall turn back their souls; the Seven Generations shall emerge from the long night. Boundless deliverance shall follow.

This decree must be obeyed without delay or disrespect.

**Notice.**
*Concluding the Address to the Assembly for the Blood Pool*

In reverence, we acknowledge the vastness of the Feathered Realm’s pool, spanning eighty-four thousand leagues—boundless, shoreless, without edge or bank. At the Assembly of Universal Light, the fifty-three buddhas, embodiments of great sagacity, great vows, great compassion, and great mercy, have expansively revealed the Dharma-gate of delivering the living and ferrying the dead. How could we fail to cultivate the karmic causes of past and future?

We humbly reflect: born as women in the world of Jambudvīpa, during the time of bearing sons and raising daughters, how could we avoid the defilements that foul heaven and earth? Unrepentant, we tread upon thin ice. Truly, we fear that on the day of Gengshen, our transgressions may be recklessly tallied. Beginning in the year of Guisi, we seek to absolve our faults—whether to repay a mother’s kindness, cultivate our own blessings, aspire to be born in the Pure Land, or prepare a bridge for others. Fortunate that the measure of merit has come full circle, we pray that both the living and the dead may benefit.

On the third day of the third lunar month, golden figures appeared in the auspicious meanders of the Qu River. Like the Buddha Śākyamuni, who manifested upon Vulture Peak to expound the Dharma and vow to deliver all beings, we now earnestly invite four or five virtuous masters to establish a night-long Daoist ritual. Before the Mirror of Karma, in the halls of King Yama, we wholeheartedly prostrate to the Master Who Saves from Suffering. Within the Alms Bowl Hermitage, beside the table of Rājagṛha, we bow in homage to the bodhisattva Maudgalyāyana.

We make offerings to the worthy sages of the ten directions, welcome the eight compassionate lords, and dedicate the merit to the assembly of holy beings. We traverse the heavens, earth, and watery underworld, clearing paths for all. Summoning the departed souls, we guide them to recognize the white clouds. With mantras, we offer sweet dew and food; with lotus lamps, we illuminate the ninety-nine layers of hell’s darkness; with orchid-scented waters, we wash clean the sixty-six joints, bringing cool purity.

We separately prepare a nighttime feast for King Yama of the Scorched Face, universally bestow alms upon the asuras and all beings, and broadly extend relief to the orphaned souls, the stagnant spirits, and those trapped in the five sufferings and three evil destinies. May all sentient beings attain perfect enlightenment. After receiving the precepts, they shall be granted certificates as proof.

We pray that the departed may wander the Western Regions, beholding Avalokiteśvara in the lapis lazuli gardens; that those who preemptively cultivate merit may live as steadfastly as Mount Tai, attending the Queen Mother’s banquet by the Kunming Pool. May the sun of the Buddha shine ever brighter, bringing joy to humans and gods.

**Notice of the Establishment of the Blood Pool Ritual Altar**

In reverence, we call forth wandering souls and restore lost spirits—especially on the third day of the third lunar month, the anniversary of the first crossing at Sizhou. For the benefit of beings, the thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Avalokiteśvara manifests in boundless freedom, vowing to become the incarnation of the Savior from Suffering and the King of the Scorched Face.

All disciples of the buddhas, if you wish to know the causes of past lives, sit again, and I shall tell you: swallowing charcoal and blackening the body is folly, deceit. Offering uncut jade is sufficient—why go further? Those who gnashed their teeth to pieces did so to establish martial merit; those who swallowed their tongues to death did so in shame over state affairs. Though their names are recorded in history, indelible, they dared not harm the hair and skin bestowed by their parents.

By the Miluo River, the waters stretch dark and vast; on Mount Shouyang, the winds blow cold and fierce. Eight thousand *li* to Chaozhou, cast adrift in lands of miasmic mists and poisonous vapors. Nineteen years upon the sea, stifled beyond the northern snows and desert sands—buried grievances unvoiced, yet their integrity stood tall. The Earl of Lu appeared in a dream to King Zhao of Yan; the descendants of Panhu were named by Emperor Gaoxin. Lord Wei transformed into a crane; the virtuous sister became a cat. Though they possessed human hearts, they were not spared the destinies of beasts.

For me, girded with gold and robed in purple—what need had I for a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle, unable to bear such hardship? To hasten as a menial, to serve as another’s slave; to pore over classics and histories, to act as a scholar’s scribe—what difference lies between noble and base?

Traveling at dusk through rain, at dawn through clouds, I recall the dreams of Wu Mountain. Greasing my chariot, feeding my horse, my soul follows the wanderings of Pan Valley. Upon the One-Sandal Ridge, lightly I tread—where do I go? Before the Jade Coffin Hall, proudly I stand—where do I turn? Buried alone by tigers, devoured by serpents, like the ghost of Ruo’ao, without refuge. The son of Yuling did not die—who was he, enduring suffering age after age? Now, dead at last, all forms are empty.

Eighty-four thousand kinds of creatures, wriggling and fluttering; three hundred sixty classes of beings, feathered, furred, scaled, and shelled. I have heard of the myna bird reciting the name of Amitābha Buddha; of the clam transformed into Avalokiteśvara. Sparrows gather to chant sutras; geese listen to the Dharma.

Tonight, the patrons of this ritual, led by so-and-so, have established a night-long Daoist ritual in the Hall of Remaining Blessings within the Eastern Palace of Spiritual Salvation. We separately prepare a measure of food and widely open the Dharma-gate. Whether sentient or insentient, what distinction is there between early and late awakening? Since you have come to attend, why ask further?

The noble one contends with none; the humane bears no lingering grudge, nor gathers factions to cast out factions. Let none exalt themselves or compare self and other. Each erects their own barriers—free from anger, free from delusion, free from preference, free from aversion. The ghost of kinship looms large, while other ghosts shrink endlessly, locked in the snail-and-clam struggle of mutual devouring. You dwell north of the sea, I south—like horses and cattle, our winds never meet. Yet across the three thousand great worlds, where are the seventy-two ranks of men?

Excellent, excellent. Thus it is, thus it is.

Fields know no starving poor; the Buddha holds compassion. In murky waters, wash your feet; in clear, wash your cap-strings. Whether in purity or progress—both are fitting. Cold becomes clothing, hunger becomes food. Is this not joy? Is this not delight?

Leap beyond the Gate of Ghosts, recognize the path to heaven. Do not let precepts and disciplines instead plunge you into confusion. Receive, uphold, and practice—you should heed this well.

Thus the proclamation is posted.

**Proclamation at the Dismissal of the Ritual Assembly**

The ghosts of Lü return in words—knowing death, yet not knowing life. The fast unifies them. Do not fear scarcity, but fear falling short. Now we prepare a single mat, summoning the ten directions. They come, drifting and carefree, vast and present as if here. Whether in thought or thoughtlessness, neither thought nor thoughtlessness—neither non-thought nor non-thoughtlessness.

If sentient, if insentient.
If neither sentient nor insentient.
If old, if young—each in due order of honor.
If noble, if base—make no distinction of high or low.

I extend compassion, wishing you to generate a heart of purity and five-colored clouds of radiance.
By night, you must listen to the Dharma spoken by the Feathered Forest Guards of the Southern Palace.
The eight-flavored celestial banquet—you must hear the scriptures expounded by the Queen Mother of the Western Realm.

Why wait to be clad in creeping fig, only to be torn asunder?
Why wait to feast on chrysanthemum blossoms, only to wither away?

Take refuge in the Treasure of the Dao, escape the ghostly bureaus.
All equally receive the kindness of deliverance, forever severed from the suffering of sinking and drowning.

A single sprinkle of sweet dew—
already abundant, already rich, already sufficient, already moistening.
Ascend together to the Azure Heaven of Origins,
without prejudice, without insistence, without rigidity, without self.

**Meritorious Dharma Utterance for Universal Deliverance**

We gaze upon Mount Hu, praying for longevity as to the Southern Mountains.
We pay homage at the Peak Court, bowing before the Purple Palace to inscribe our names.
On the third day of the third month, the sky is bright and the qi clear—
the six senses and six perceptions are cleansed of dust and defilement.

Plant good fruits upon the assembly of the Spirit Mountain,
give birth to golden lotuses in the pond of the Feathered Realm.
Those who hold the grasses to summon souls and offer prayers for the departed—
may they behold the visage of Māyā.
With flowers tucked behind their ears, those beauties—
may they wish to journey to the Land of Bliss.

Let this serve as a bridge and a permanent tally.
Thus the document is issued.

**Proclamation to the Departed Souls of the Southern and Northern Temples**

Where men are bright, ghosts are dark—yet when ghosts return, their spiritual souls descend to earth while their ethereal souls ascend to heaven, and heaven may be reached. Following the rites and canons, we broadly establish vegetarian feasts, seeking to forge karmic bonds with all beings. We wish to borrow but a square inch of ground, for who would say the waters of a well or valley cannot sustain a school of fish? Fortunately, the mountains of pine and cypress suffice to shelter flocks of crows—none shall be excluded.

We make this special provision in advance: holding orchid grasses to dispel misfortune, scattering flowers in the grove to exalt the Great Brahmā. Lamps and candles glow in the moonlight of night, while banners and pennants dance in the morning breeze. If we would aid these souls—how could we not proceed by this Way?

Let them eat of rice and wear of brocade—shall they not know warmth and fullness? Let them taste our horses and anoint our chariots, that their wandering wishes may be fulfilled. How could we bear even one to weep in solitude? Thus, though they come from a thousand *li* away, the distance is not far. The lairs of dragons and serpents shall directly ferry their boats; the passes of tigers and leopards shall unlock their chains.

Let each rest in their place—what doubt remains? Though the dreams of skulls are not the spring and autumn of the human world, if liver and gall are lost, it is as if one’s own kin have become strangers. All are neighbors, all are kin—what fences exist? What divisions of "you" and "me"?

We issue this proclamation first—let there be no clamor. May the Earth-Lord Bright King temporarily serve as a bodhisattva exhorting virtue. Above, the August Heaven; below, the Empress Earth—truly they hear the words of filial sons and obedient grandsons. In the southern fire marsh and northern water pool, they shall naturally attain the wondrous refinement of form and essence. Without distinction of noble or base, all shall be enabled to ascend.

Thus the proclamation is posted.

**Proclamation to Wandering Spirits**

We declare: the life you were given was never truly yours—from this moment, let death return to life.

The Dao is fundamentally non-action; henceforth, turn your hearts toward the Way. Seizing the moment of awakening, the karmic conditions of past lives, the merit defies all measure.

The immortals know the greatest joy. To the east lie the caverns of Cloudy Mount and the chambers of Green Mound; to the west, the celestial city of Tianyong and the terraces of Dark Garden; to the south, the mountains of Qingdu and the palaces of Flowing Fire; to the north, the courts of Supreme Mystery and the halls of Purple Void. From present to past, from ancient times to now, countless millennia have passed. Though this realm and that may differ in strength, they lie hundreds of millions of miles apart—ordinary folk cannot reach them, the vulgar cannot hear of them.

This is the land where the great sages of the ten directions wander and rest, the gathering place of the lofty perfected ones of the Three Realms. Its governance is effortless, its people pure and simple. Clothing and food arise naturally; forms and faces are upright and proper. There is no noble or base, no rich or poor, no right or wrong, no self or other, no taking or giving, no love or hatred.

That which is born is born, yet never ends. That which takes form takes form, yet never exists.

Through countless generations it endures, through kalpas unending it remains. The sun and moon shine without cease, wind and rain follow their proper measure. The four seasons proceed in constant harmony, the five grains ever ripen in abundance. Rare blossoms and sweet herbs bear names each distinct; numinous mushrooms and auspicious grasses defy all description of their forms. Those patterned in five colors are not few, nor are the nine-hued phoenixes with three feet. The tortoise called *Ben* lives yet a hundred years; jade hounds bay at night, golden cockerels herald the dawn. Cloud-wreathed mountains stretch boundless, rivers flow vast and deep. Though set within this very cosmos, it presents a scene of another kind—dim and distant, beyond all bounds, a primal heaven not yet divided, swirling in primordial chaos.

One might call oneself a man of Fuxi’s age, yet never suspect one has lived to the kalpa’s end. To be born here, to grow here—could one not rejoice? Could one not delight? You, departed spirits, who would inquire of that other world: I have heard the wondrous Dharma, and it may serve as a bridge to this place, a means to bind karmic ties with all beings. Thus we establish the Mysterious Capital Offering, the ritual precinct solemn and still in the boundless void. We open the summons to the Celestial Physicians, the divine tigers perform the lads’ dance. We enact the Hunyuan writ, repent toward the directions, receive precepts and transmit talismans. We make universal offerings to the Ten Kings, brightly repaying the Three Realms. We proclaim the image-texts, intone the scriptures. Lamp-light pierces the realm of darkness; the unhindered feast of measured food is universally bestowed. Bathed in the Flower Pool, we wash away the floating veils of past years. We open the roads of the underworld, and now discern today’s journey. Turn not back—step firmly forward. Five *zhang* below the earth, a pearl the size of a millet grain hangs in the empty mystery; nine gates open in the heavens, leading straight through the Great Floating Li Soil to the First Azure. The words above are true—hear them well.

Thus the proclamation is posted.
Again...

Holding fast the Golden Deity’s seasonal rites, the Lesser Howl enacts its authority. The Middle Prime is the time for reviewing the registers of life; the seventh day is the assembly for celebrating birth. According to the seasonal customs of Jing and Chu, this legacy endures—stirring the hearts of all beings as wind and landscape shift. Leaves fall in the courtyard: we sigh at the fleeting passage of days and months. The dew’s chill sobers the air: we lament our forms and shadows, mourning ourselves. What has gone cannot return; what has passed cannot be pursued. Were we to compose a "Summons of the Soul" in the manner of Song Yu, we fear the soul might not come when called. Were we to emulate Jia Yi’s "Lament for the Dead," our sighs would be in vain, for none would understand us.

Now, wishing to inquire into the methods of life, we first enter the Assembly of Universal Deliverance. The Most High possesses the scriptural hymns for rescuing the suffering and delivering the departed; the *Lingbao* holds the rites for reviving the dead and restoring the living. These are the essential ford for transcending the world—here one may seize the moment and awaken to the Dao.

At the outset, what is called "life"? What is called "death"? Yet at its ultimate, there is neither death nor life.

Now, the patron of this fast, [Name], has conceived this aspiration and wishes to open the gate of expedient means. If you spirits possess awareness, you may tread the path of return. At the sight of Mount Xian’s weeping cliffs, your souls shall ascend here. The rightful community is restored, and no soul shall fail to descend. The feast of this fast transcends the dusty world: to the east lies the Wilds of No Purchase; to the west, the Land of Silence; to the south, the Courts of Kunlun; to the north, the Palace of Primordial Mystery. Yet all these lie but within the space of a single thought—go straight, and you reach the First Azure Heaven. Coming and going freely, unobstructed and unbounded, countless bodies gather, entering a millet-grain pearl suspended in the void. We summon the Five Directional Lads, who hold lotus blossoms to guide the way.

Let this admonition be heard and known.

Thus the proclamation is posted.

After the court’s dismissal, the notice is posted below the realm.

Li, the Daoist officer, burns the memorial tablet—this is the occasion for Lady Zhang’s release from her cup. When the Merit Officer recites the scriptures, it becomes the path for none to transcend.

Records of events and transmissions of the numinous resound through past and present.

Alas, you who dwell in the six dark passes of the underworld and the three wretched destinies of suffering! Through endless nights, you have not glimpsed the light of sun or moon; through kalpas of many lives, how could you know the misty radiance beyond the world?

Tonight, at this very hour, come hasten to the Dharma assembly. To the left and right, compose yourselves. Though there are distinctions of rank, there is no division of noble and base. From Yue in the south to the Hu in the north—why separate you as "us" and "them"? From dawn to dusk, what difference is there between new ghosts and old? Since we now share the bond of those who meet as friends by the roadside, there is no need to follow banners and divide into factions like cattle.

I have true words—you should listen closely. Those who gather ferns for food—how do they compare to those who feast from the celestial kitchens? Those who stitch lotus leaves for clothing—how do they compare to those robed in cloud-silk? Though Su the Academician possessed talent, he still suffered hunger and cold. How could the aspirations of Wang the Top Graduate not lie in warmth and sustenance?

Now, take this single drop of pure soul-water and transform it into the gate of sweet dew for the great thousandfold world. The Floating Li Soil lies directly before the First Azure Heaven, from the realm of form to the formless realm. Mount Tai is but the Eastern Marchmount’s palace—enter the Small Heavenly Gate to reach the Great Heavenly Gate. Do not stray onto the path of delusion; together, return to the Great Dao.

Alas, you lonely souls—alive, you drift like floating clouds; dead, you rest like fading shadows. Why then cling to the burdens of mouth and body? Is it not because your hun and po have yet to find their home, and so such thoughts arise?

One sip of jade nectar stirs a hundred emotions; when the dark frost is pounded away, the cloud maiden appears. I ponder the intent of this verse—could it be that rich flavors fail to satisfy the mouth? Woven from mist and purple silk, the robe brings only toil without joy, the face left unadorned. I savor the meaning here—could it be that light warmth fails to comfort the body?

The affairs of celestial immortals I dare not discuss. As for the spirit way, it cannot but rely on mortals to act: offerings of grain must be made, silks and cloth must fill the sacrificial pits. Yet are these grain and silk truly what the spirits depend upon?

Thus Confucius said: *"Eating coarse rice, drinking plain water, resting one’s arm as a pillow—joy lies therein."* Zilu said: *"I wish for carriages and horses, light furs, to share them with friends until they wear out, without regret."* Mencius said: *"With five mu of land, plant mulberry—those of fifty may wear silk."* Again he said: *"With a hundred mu of fields, do not rob them of their seasons—an eight-member household may know no hunger."* These words of the great sages, inscribed in books, were set forth for humankind.

The starving man beneath the mulberry tree wished to become a warrior. The affection for the coarse robe nearly cost the master his life. Straw sandals and hempen cloth—how frugal! Lotus garments and chrysanthemum meals—how pure! For clothing and food are what all people depend upon; not a single day can they be lacking.

How bitter it is—endless sands without resentment, yet dim and desolate. Cast among blades and arrows, heaven and earth grow sorrowful. Bones become the soil of a foreign land; souls become ghosts of a neighboring realm. With no one to offer mourning or sacrifice, what is to be done?

Duke Cheng of Wei dreamed of Kang Shu, who said: *"They vie to take my offerings."* The ghosts of Ruo’ao, if not fed by sacrifices, will their fate not soon perish? And consider the mantis seizing the cicada, the hound Han Lu snatching the swift hare, the chicken pecking at insects, the hawk striking at mice and sparrows—all rush for food, harboring no malice. The golden-robed lord, the black-clad master, the loom weaving new brocade, the powder passed down from the Qin Terrace—though called unknowing, each still seeks honor and nobility.

The bee’s flower, the fly’s buzzing pipe, the mosquito’s drone, the louse’s gnawing, the ant’s devotion to the pot, the moth’s flight into the flame—born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all cling to life. There is no other reason: each values its own nature and life. Since you know your nature and life, why not turn your hearts toward the Dao?

Tonight, eat my dharma-food, wear my dharma-robes, heed my dharma-words. Let all lonely souls within the three thousand great thousandfold dharma-realms—whether with masters or without, with thought or without, with form or without, of the ten kinds—abandon all craving and attachment, cast aside all doubt and suspicion, dissolve the distinctions of self and other. Thus, thus, all shall be delivered, bound straight for the land of rebirth.

Roam south to the wilds of Wangmai, rest north in the silent lands of Moyi, wander west into the dark realms of Xijia, pass east through the primordial radiance of Hongmeng. Above, no heaven; below, no earth—carefree and at ease, is this not joy?

Let this proclamation be known to all. Thus posted.

**Proclamation for the Establishment of the Ullambana Assembly to the Lower Realms**

Descendants of Lü give birth to sons, and sons in turn beget descendants—how dare they forget the nurturing grace of generation upon generation? Men become ghosts, and ghosts again become men, yet they cannot escape the suffering of endless cycles of rebirth. Of all meritorious deeds, none surpasses this.

In this world of three thousand realms, there are patrons—so-and-so and others—who, on this auspicious day of the Earth Official’s Great Amnesty, reverently establish the Assembly of the Heavenly Worthy in the Mystic Capital. Since they earnestly honor the departed and cherish the distant, how could they fail to extend this kindness to others? They summon all ten kinds of lonely souls to deliver them from every suffering and hardship. Though the cold are clothed and the hungry fed, why do they remain as fleeting as foam, as transient as rest? Why do they still come?

Let each abide in their place. Do not rely on strength to bully the weak, nor raise the armies of Jin and Chu. Do not harbor grudges to seek revenge, nor nurse the hatreds of Wu and Yue. Do not treat fellow passengers as enemies, nor wield spears within your own home. Do not let two tigers fight where the terrain cannot sustain them, nor imitate insects that devour one another and bring ruin upon themselves. Rather than clinging to "you are you and I am I," why not break down the fences between us all?

When one speaks of form as non-form and emptiness as non-emptiness, the other shore is seen to be utterly free of wind and waves. Only filial children can bestow blessings upon all, and only the benevolent do not shrink from such offerings. Though this begins with us, how can we bear to leave you behind? In the realm of darkness, a single somersault will lift you to rise upon the Terrace of Fragrant Mist. Recognize the hundred-step stairway—step firmly upon it.

Follow the Mystic Precepts and do not stray onto the path of delusion.

**Proclamation to the Lower Realms**

For the living, food that pleases the mouth may be fine millet or coarse fodder; garments that adorn the body may be humble hemp or noble fox fur. None can do without these. But for ghosts—how can they partake?

Alas, you foolish and bewildered beings, drifting through the four modes of birth! The six paths hear no sound, and without sound, there are no mouths—though food exists, how can you eat it? They see no form, and without form, there are no bodies—though clothing exists, how can you wear it? Why then do you suffer the torments of sinking and drowning? It all arises from the mind of craving and attachment.

When the Duke of Jin took the voice of an ox, it was because sound implies a mouth, and a mouth seeks food. When Master Sheng transformed into a pig, it was because form implies a body, and a body clings to clothing. Pressed by hunger and cold, how can one attend to propriety and righteousness?

Now that you have come here, what will you do? Do not wield a dull hammer to strike a sharp awl. Each person has their shortcomings—do not weary of old fists or sate yourself on poison. What do the noble contend over? Do not let Han Lu and Dong Guo dogs exhaust one another before you, nor let the yellow sparrow and mantis devour each other behind you.

Only when one is like Lu Kang and Yang Hu, who reconciled the enmity between Wu and Jin, or like You Yu and Zi□, who turned Hu and Yue into brothers, can you cast aside grudges. Why not stop your carriage, share a mat of grass, and walk together? Walk together, but let the elder go first.

Let those who come, come; let those who go, go—each to their place of rebirth. I extend the kindness of warmth and fullness; you dispel the state of freezing and starvation. The divine lamps shine like the sun, their light witnessed by all in heaven. The Dharma-water rains down like a shower, its moisture universally bestowed upon the void. Cultivate these merits to build this bridge.

Take each other by the hand and ascend the jade steps—whether to advance or linger, whether to hasten or delay. Inscribe your names in the Golden Register—who will be first, and who will follow? For now, act as the King of Equality and attend the Unobstructed Assembly.

Let this proclamation be issued without clamor.

Thus posted.

Amidst the boundless expanse of layered gates, in the endless night’s profound obscurity, before recounting the thousandfold vastness, let us first speak of the six realms’ boundless expanse. The Four Formless Realms remain formless, yet their emptiness is but delusion. The Three Realms’ sentient beings never escape illusion’s transformations. The oranges’ playful elephants—are they free from deceit’s guile? The lotus’s lingering rings—can they sever the longing of affection’s thoughts?

Across all dharma-realms, those called celestial immortals still possess human hearts—how much more so the spirits of the Dao. Ancient sites in mountains and rivers, sacred altars and spirit shrines: when bells resound and apes cry, the plain temple is revered above the Southern Marchmount. The stone engraved with the iron horse’s dream—did it not fulfill the "Yellow Ox’s" prophecy? Though called divine powers, they still crave blood offerings.

Among those with eyes and ears, who willingly lends their sight and hearing? Among those with mouths and bodies, who willingly endures hunger and cold? Do they not take each step in thought, free from desire? Those who returned jade to their lords—where is that jade now? Those who died presenting their kingdoms—how foolish were those kingdoms! The horse of Chaoyang would not advance, though eight thousand *li* lay ahead. The paper of the sea would not nurture, though nineteen years passed in reckoning. Spears were not yet rested when spears were lost; oars were not yet struck when oars vanished.

Though souls and spirits do not rot like deadwood, fame and merit are but empty blossoms. Some care not for wealth and rank, some shut their ears to right and wrong—rinsing in streams, resting on stones, angling for the moon, plowing the clouds. The elixir crucible remains, yet its furnace smoke has turned to ash. The meditation cell endures, yet its skeletal image has crumbled to dust.

Then there are the nine schools—physicians and diviners—and the hundred arts—actors and entertainers: those who mock dwarfs escape not Confucius’ condemnation; those who take sorcerers as omens avoid not Duke Mu’s folly. Risking life on perilous poles and leaping swords, gambling existence on danger. Divining with turtle shells and casting tiles—why not heed their own omens? Scheming with traps and snares—why rely on force? Competing for profit with brush and coin—how does it compare to boats and carts?

Though born alike, who knows how death differs? Some face battle and sacrifice themselves for their country: tongues may sever, yet eyes still glare; entrails may be devoured, yet bodies do not yield. The flames on Yan Mountain blaze fiercely—not for one snake alone. The waters of Miluo River surge boundlessly—not to stand apart from the crowd. The crow, unaware of fleeing, met its minced fate here. Without distinguishing suspicion, this scale led to its boiling. Those who imitated the bear’s roar—had their plans exhausted. Those who captured snakes—few remained.

Wealth harms the self; boasting of gold’s abundance is vain. Beauty injures the body; the sorrow of moth-eyebrows is futile. All flows on thus—what words remain? Alas, you multitudes, failing to find your place of rebirth, why enter the realm of death without guilt?

As for those who gape awaiting food—shame on their bloated bellies. Those naked and bare—deeply ashamed of their tattered quilted robes. Mouths shrunken—worse than a crow’s peck. Necks elongated—nearly like a crane’s form. The women of Xia Mountain often awaken as apes. The villagers of Fu Village—how did they transform into tigers? Some born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation; some clad in scales, armor, or feathers. Though lacking human hearts, they possess hearts turned toward the Dao—these are the ghostly and beastly realms.

All you named and nameless kinds, mastered and masterless souls—why have you come? There is reason. Do not let the low surpass the noble, the distant surpass the close. Do not let the strong bully the weak, the many oppress the solitary. Rather, like fish moistening one another with foam, do not imitate beasts that fight when cornered.

The Southern and Northern Seas—are their customs truly so different? The people of Qin and Yue—are their hearts not equally sorrowful? When punishments are discussed, even strangers meet as new friends. Act now as the King of Equality and attend the Universal Salvation Assembly. To be clothed and fed—is this not joy? To be joyful—is this not delight? To bathe virtue and cleanse the body—is this not purity? To advance—is this not progress? To ascend the Dao’s shore, to climb the immortal steps—these are no empty words. Each should listen carefully.

Thus posted.

**Notice for Wandering Souls**

What makes humans spiritually superior to all things? Knowing heaven and earth’s nurturing power, they must also feel the sorrow of frost and dew. How does creation bring forth all beings? Though it shows no favor in sun and moon’s illumination, can it lack the thunder’s wrathful might?

Today, the Daoist Liang, in reverence, recalls his father’s labor in building the house, cherishes his grandfather’s sharing of sweetness, his grandmother’s nurturing kindness yet unrepayed, his great-uncle’s exhorting words not forgotten. Recently, at the White Water Plain, he consulted the Green Crow divination to arrange burial rites, expressing filial devotion and pledging posthumous cultivation to bestow blessings. Unforeseen, this day has come—fearing to betray that earlier vow, he respectfully chooses this season of orange and tangerine, offering simple sacrifices of grain and fruit.

He respectfully invites the officiating officials to array solemn dignity, first purifying the sacred altar, then summoning the underworld. As for the rebellious dogs, stubborn and fierce, harboring treacherous schemes, embodying inauspicious omens and malevolent hearts—those who stealthily spy on lofty walls like rats, or presumptuously peer at grand tunnels like mantises, unaware of departure or approach, as foolish as dull steeds—let the multitude’s wrath brook no tolerance. The divine might blazes forth; relying on the Mysterious Law, they are delivered to the Demon-Quelling Star.

As for the pitiable wandering souls, the forsaken lingering spirits—having come to this assembly, what will you do in this hall? Form joyful bonds; do not harbor notions of self and other. Past enmities—let them all be resolved. Today’s heartfelt words—let them be briefly exchanged. Whether once old friends or neighbors bound by trust, whether decaying with orchids or enduring like metal and stone—use this to plan for yourselves; I will not betray your hopes.

Hungry ones—provide them food; why remain gaunt and self-aware?
Cold ones—clothe them; let none stand naked at my side.
With the waters of Canglang, wash your feet.
With the purest of springs, cleanse your hearts.
May you awaken and ascend, while the myriad beings, lost in delusion, stumble and fall.
Step upon the jade stairs, where clouds rise in towering peaks, and gaze afar at the radiance of the golden palaces.
The immortal source stretches boundless—is not the journey forward a joy?
By this decree, let all take heed.

Moreover, the forms of yang and the statutes of yin—originally no different in law, for they stem from the same source.
Heaven and hell—how far apart are they? The difference lies not beyond the span of a heart.
Daoist schools speak of their existence;
the discourse of the noble declares their absence.
Today, the female disciple of the Dao, so-and-so, grieving for the Old Lord so-and-so, whose life and death follow their appointed time—no untended carbuncle goes unhealed—yet on the dark paths of the netherworld, she remains troubled by idle words.
Without the aid of incense and cultivation, how can liberation be attained?
Thus, she invokes the Supervisor of the Fast, the Valiant General of the Straight Price, the hounds and falcons, bidding them trace the path and point the way.
Let malevolent foxes and wicked crows take flight and soar far away; let the moon’s clarity dispel the lingering miasma.
Above, let it reach the Three Realms; below, let it descend to the Nine Springs.
All imprisoned souls—look up and obey this decree of amnesty.
Demand their bonds from the Ox-Head jailers; let no venomous harm arise, as from a wolf’s wild heart.
The punishments of grinding pestles, boiling cauldrons, and scorching fires—what code prescribes them?
The tortures of fire beds and iron registers—what scripture records them?
Kneeling, they find no ground to voice their grievances; crying out, they see no path to heaven.
Let all be released without delay; none shall be detained.
Let lingering spirits, forsaken souls, the beings of the Four Births and Six Paths—all gather at this Dharma assembly to forge good karma together.
Do not let the lowly envy the noble, nor the strong bully the weak.
Do not divide self from other, for how can I alone escape?
Do not let north remain north and south remain south, never to meet.
Let joy abound—those near rejoice, those far draw close.
Come with light hearts: the first call, the last respond.
Shoulder to shoulder, they laugh and speak; hand in hand, they sing and chant.
Let each arise in compassion—this is called equality.
Wash your cap-strings in purity or your feet in filth—who can speak of the world as a muddy mire?
Feed the hungry, clothe the cold—was the vow of a lifetime ever merely for warmth and sustenance?
Having returned to the Great Dao, one may inquire of the art of living.
Emerging from the gates of the dead, you cross into my realm.
The time is now—do not let it slip; how can you fail to seize this moment of celestial celebration?
O souls, go forth—this path leads to the discourse of the Dao’s emptiness and formlessness.

Moreover—alas!—death is but a return.
To return is to return to the Dao.
The Dao takes formlessness as its essence.
Dim and silent, vast and obscure—I cannot force a name upon the departed.
Thirty-seven springs and autumns—what stirred the longing to return, only to halt here?
Tracing the cause, there is reason indeed.
Recently, a woman’s illness did not abate; perhaps swayed by reckless, deluded words, her heart grew troubled, her mind confused.
Bewildered, as if in dream or drunkenness, like scorching winds spreading poison, like barbarian mists burying all in dust.
She turned back, yet unexpectedly, the twin demons of illness struck at her vital essence.
With the woman’s untimely death, her grief and lament deepened the abyss—thus, no remedy could prevail.
The spirit realm offered no response; beyond Yellow Mound Mountain, her destination remained unknown.
Darkness gave way to light in the blink of five days.
Day after day, month after month—ever more distant.
Without the power of the Dao, who would guide her delusion and lead her to this return?
Frost chills the moon, a lone crow cries mournfully—at this moment, in this sorrow, what will you become?
Though endowed with the vigor of heroes, though your heart be as wood or stone, how can you remain unmoved by the sighs of orphaned children and widowed wives?
You must awaken compassion, bear witness to devotion, guard and shield, and never indulge in wayward paths that breed defilement.
Let the departed soul return to the Dao—no greater merit exists.
As for the paths of heaven, humanity, spirits, the Dao, hell, ghosts, and beasts—desolate and distant, bound to the Dao—
seen, they have no form; heard, they make no sound.
Yet why must you cling to thoughts of greed, anger, and delusion, to the worldly pursuits of the mortal realm?
Having come here, what will you do?
Clothe yourselves in these robes—no more cries of cold.

Feed, and you shall be fed—no more wails of hunger.
From this moment forth, may you awaken to understanding.
The East cannot be relied upon; the South cannot be your abode.
The West’s shifting sands, the North’s flying snow—none can be dwelt in long.
How can you not turn your heart toward the Dao?

May you, the departed spirits, together ascend the shore of the Dao.
Even the joy of wind-dancing in the rain-altars cannot surpass this.
Know this.

Thus, the proclamation is posted.

Moreover:
Life and death are the constant of day and night, stretching from ancient past to present without end.
Ghosts and spirits follow the Dao of yin and yang, sighing at the boundless cycle of beginning and end.
Yet from a single thought of good or evil arises the divergence of suffering and bliss along two paths.
Deluded in mind, ignorant of principle, they chase shadows and lose the true.
Fortunate to encounter this sagely age, where rites of universal deliverance are established,
where the profound teachings of the Dao are expounded,
where reverence for ancestors is displayed,
and where the benevolence of aiding and saving is magnified.
Such great virtue as this is rarely met.

You wandering souls, adrift in the hidden traces of the netherworld,
lingering in the long night—
though your sorrows are myriad and vast,
know that the Six Paths stretch boundlessly before you.
Those who cling to delusion are ensnared by things and burdened by them.
Those entangled in attachments bear the weight of form upon form.
Sunk in the dark and desolate paths, cast into realms of desolation and chill,
some wail beneath the stars and moon,
some howl amid wind and rain.
Unheard by those who mourn and offer sacrifices,
unclaimed even in burial—
at the ends of the earth, to whom can you turn for refuge?
Beneath the slanting sun over fragrant grasses, you long in vain for home.
To speak of this is to feel deep sorrow and compassion.

Yet by the golden register rites performed in the light,
the Supreme Lord opens the cinnabar mausoleum of the Dao,
revealing the wondrous Dharma of rebirth for you,
bestowing the good cause of deliverance from death.
Cleanse your thoughts, purify your hearts,
and all shall heed the precepts of the Nine Perfected.
Warm your robes, fill your bellies,
and together escape the afflictions of the Five Sufferings.
Forever attain freedom, with no more entanglements.

Thus, the proclamation is posted.
*End of Scroll Eleven of Xu Xian’s Literary Works*

**Scroll Twelve of Xu Xian’s Literary Works**

**Memorial for the Restoration of Lingji Palace**
We observe that the construction of this palace has proceeded for six years. Recently, the eastern pond has dried up entirely, no longer offering the joy of divine and mortal communion. The roof lacks over ten thousand tiles. Those near and far who seek the spirits’ favor have voiced no small distress—surely none lack the heart to give generously.

We recall that building a house takes three years, yet still invites the criticism of passersby. A mountain built to nine *ren* may yet be undone by a single basket’s shortfall. Our Perfected One is both enlightened and efficacious. Let all of like mind remain steadfast to the end as at the beginning. Though this palace nears completion, the eastern pond’s desiccation gives cause for concern, and the western inscription shames us with thoughts of leaking roofs.

All around, in the ten directions, are benefactors. Above, within three feet, divine presences watch over us. Do not say that sweet wine is not offered in thatched halls—after libations, perhaps cassia wood may yet mend the medicine chest. The sum still lacking is precisely what is needed. Thus, we make our plea.

To count grains of rice before cooking betrays the narrowness of our own vision. To donate a million in wealth reveals the heart of a true elder. Since this is a plea for divine favor, why not give with joy? Let none hesitate in their generosity.

**Memorial for the Construction of the Divine Kitchen**
Long has the stone statue of Xu stood as a folk shrine—what is this if not a thousand years of virtuous governance? When Magistrate Chen wished to oversee the local altar, he sought to etch his name for ten thousand generations. His intent was not in the butchery of offerings but in the solemnity of sacrifice.

The new temple stands grand, a majestic sight in the land. Yet the old kitchen, exposed to wind and rain, totters on four crumbling walls. Though rise and fall follow destiny, creation lies in human hands. Once, we built by the roadside; now, we raise beams with purpose. Through the counsel of the worthy, the divine kitchen is complete.

How splendid! How magnificent! Soon, its grandeur will be fully revealed. Here, the distant may drink; here, they may feast. Thus, the temple’s majesty shall be restored.

**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings**
We recall that the five aggregates are empty—who perceives the three thousand great worlds? All buddhas arise from the work of the mind. To accumulate goodness is to build the Hall of Remnant Blessings, exhorting others to do the same. This blessed land is a pure realm indeed.

We have seen that in the first year of the Xinglong era, this luminous pavilion was raised, yet it lacked the Zhongtong paper currency. Those who gave willingly found the Buddha’s witness. In this life, we forge karmic bonds for this life—even a single coin carries its own merit.

Axes fell trees, saws shape them; tiles must be broken, walls painted. Through diligent effort, we await the day bricks are polished into mirrors. With this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble.

**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings, Requesting Monks as Fundraisers**
We recall the thousand hundred million transformation bodies, each dust-mote realm attaining buddhahood. In the ten directions, every land is a bodhimandala. Do not dismiss what is seen as weightier than what is heard—one must act here to achieve there. All beings may be liberated, yet one must not forget one’s native soil.

Our great master was once the monk of Ao Peak. The Hall of Remnant Blessings has long held the incense of Hu Rock—whether form or formless, it meets the conditions for enlightenment. Through exhortation and alms-seeking, we have gained the aid of celestial musicians.

Having already hung lamps and tempered the arm, why shrink from cutting flesh or offering the body? Let us repair the eastern wall and western wall, lest wind and rain intrude. The scale shall be grand, the renewal complete. From beginning to end, it shall be a boundless field of merit.

Henceforth, let this karmic bond be fulfilled.

**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings**
We recall the alms-seeking across the ten directions—from the southern continent to the northern, years of cultivation. From the eastern land to the western, all are seeds of the Buddha. Do not bark at the old bhikṣu for finding it hard to beg—know that resolve makes deeds easy.

The elder scatters gold, known as the great *āraṇya*. The Hall of Accumulated Goodness and the Hall of Remnant Blessings are the bodhimandala of Dingguang Yuan. We must establish present and future causes and effects. From this point onward, renewal is our aim.

Vows as deep as cranes’ crowns and reeds’ knees. Beams like phoenixes, eaves like halos—how grand the scale! Thirty thousand loads of earth, great the expense. Thousands of donors, vast the merit.

Many have cast forth their treasures, bursting the bag of illusions. No longer shaken by wind and rain, even dragons and devas praise this work. With this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble, awakening the bodhi-mind—great compassion, great joy, great giving. Countless are the marks of virtue and fortune, boundless and immeasurable.

From beginning to end, may it be completed. With raised hands and lifted brows, we shall gaze upon it in reverence.

**Memorial for the Restoration of Ciji Palace**
We recall the stored essence of the Bohai Sea, manifesting the thirty-two marks of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. In Tongcheng, the incense of Ciji has burned for over two hundred years. Wherever it is established, the name remains the same.

This hall, now ruined and fallen—is its restoration in earth and timber difficult or easy? We look to the thousand benefactors for witness. Let not the mendicant’s vows be in vain; even a single tile or beam’s aid is welcome.

Fortunately, there is no division between this and that realm—let us forge bonds with ten thousand people. Meeting from a thousand *li*, let all give with joy, and it shall be completed this very day.

Phoenixes soar, halos fly—how grand the scale shall be! Cocks crow, dogs bark—may the teachings spread far and wide. This is the transformation of black cloth into silk, the return of auspicious omens once lost.

Through this offering, may it serve as a bridge across the sea of suffering. The merit is beyond measure, the karmic fruit beyond thought. Gold scattered upon the earth—we have heard of Sudatta’s path to buddhahood. Incense burned to heaven—may we emulate the blessings Hua Feng offered to the sage.

With this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble.

**Memorial for the Reconstruction of Wenxing Hermitage, Including Fundraising and Poetry Competitions**
We recall that Wenxing Hermitage plans to raise beams—its rise and fall are fated. A thatched hall cannot be a painted cake; without the right people, nothing can be achieved.

Though honored by your gracious presence, I have been remiss in offering proper hospitality—may Heaven and Earth bear witness to this heart.

Fine days and fair scenes, rare since ancient times, are now ours to share. Reopening the old shop, let us all share a smile. From all four directions, patrons of old return. Say not that this second coming costs no coin.

What is right today may have been wrong before—yet once a matter has passed, let no blame remain. Neither ill-willed nor unkind, may we meet anew as if for the first time. No empty promises shall be made; only progress sought.

**Memorial for the Restoration of Qilong Temple at Aofeng**
We recall that Qilong Mountain, where banners flutter, holds a true dragon’s lair—its paths winding, peaks circling. To fish from the turtle’s head, one must first claim its crown; where earth is sacred, men are noble.

Though the grove lies shadowed, an ancient temple stands solemn still. For generations, this land has known blood offerings and incense smoke. Yet long has it lain in ruin—its rise and fall fated. Now, renewal is our aim, the divination auspicious.

Phoenixes take flight in radiant splendor, yet we seek no excess. Cocks crow, dogs bark—we glimpse the signs of peace. Gods and men rejoice alike; village and shrine rest in harmony.

Plans are made in unison, but strength must be shared. To raise even a single beam is no task for one timber alone. Beneath the shade of mulberry and catalpa, who would withhold aid? From the great households, middling ones, and humble alike—let each offer what they can.

Inscribe it boldly, repeatedly, without fear of ink. Let many copies of *Zhiyuan* be displayed, that we may await Heaven’s blessings of peace and prosperity.

**Memorial for the Restoration of the Boundary Bridge**
We recall that this bridge, standing for three hundred years, now crumbles—its fate inescapable. In the eleventh month, a temporary crossing was built; the people, unburdened, pledged their hearts.

Yet we must rely on the vows of elders, the surplus grain of monks, the spare wealth of donors—these will ensure lasting sufficiency. To cultivate good roots is to honor good fruits; such is the principle we follow.

Not for fame or profit, but to seize the moment. Travelers shall pass without peril, and descendants know boundless blessings.

**Memorial for Bridge Repairs and Fundraising by Lottery**
We recall the vast labor of mending western walls and eastern partitions. First the lesser, then the greater—let accounts of wealth and righteousness be clear.

Empty words avail nothing; only capital yields profit. A clever wife without flour cannot make even a simple cake. You have tasted the pear—now, in this time of peace, why refuse the passing note?

Thirty lots, no burden to carry, bought and matched in an instant. The first prize, truly refined, wins all acclaim in the poetry contest. Drawn by chance, some gain favor. Witnessed by kin, none dare act carelessly.

Here is the translation:

---

Present matters are neither false nor deceitful. Wealth in the world is ever in use and ever abundant. A thousand-character text bears a thousand-character mark—mutual agreement binds all. Among ten thousand people, ten thousand connections are made, and merit is fulfilled.

Casual village speech may stir the hearts of the young.

**Memorial for Road Repairs**
We recall the post road where travelers come and go, this thoroughfare spanning ten thousand li. The pagoda and bridge stand but a short distance apart, yet they mark the vital junction between two villages. Recently, floodwaters have risen, turning level paths perilous. Though all wish to do good, none can act alone. If we do not plan now, fertile fields may once more become seas—accumulation begins with small steps. Stone upon stone can form a mountain. In this time of peace, why refuse the passing note?

Thanks to the building of dikes, no detours will be needed. By joining in collective causes, we mend this shared ground. A steady step forward—this is the first stage on the road to the capital.

**Memorial for Dike Repairs**
We recall that where water has embankments, floods cause no harm. Where fields know neither drought nor deluge, abundant harvests may be expected—though mountains and valleys shift over time. Years have passed, and the balance of yin and yang has faltered, leaving many lingering ills.

Now we propose to rebuild the dike, restoring the old watercourse. Ten thousand oxen may haul the stone, but only thus can the waters be held back. Baskets of earth piled high will form a barrier strong enough to defend. Though we follow the land’s contours with wisdom, we must also contribute wealth and labor.

Let neither landlord nor tenant make distinctions—together, we secure blessings for generations to come. We humbly request your brush to set these words to paper, that contributions may rise like clouds.

What flows east must first flow west. What is done above will be mirrored below. To channel the Jing into the Wei, one must not shirk labor. To dredge the Huai and clear the Si, there is indeed a Way. Success is certain—granaries will overflow, and storehouses brim. The blessings are many: first wealth, then longevity.

**Memorial for Establishing a Merit-Gathering Ritual**
We recall that in the great Ming, under Heaven’s mandate, all who accumulate goodness receive the five blessings of peace. Now, in this age of prosperity, in towns and villages alike, let us together achieve good karma, each awakening to the task.

Nobles and commoners alike, we humbly request your great brushes. May abundant virtue and power be bestowed. As the people observe the three-month repentance rituals, may four seasons of fortune gather—may the aged flourish, may all prosper.

**Memorial for Prayers and Exorcism**
We recall that when baleful qi recedes and auspicious qi harmonizes, disaster is averted and hardship resolved. The Dao of Heaven is distant, but the Dao of humanity is near—thus we seek favor through offerings.

For the moment a thought arises, the gods take note—yet how can deeds be without consequence? The finest incense is not native to this soil. Wax candles and bright lamps may borrow light from neighbors. Let us uphold the peace of our village and hear the music of a well-ordered age.

Therefore, the noble-minded anticipate misfortune and take precautions. Do not dismiss minor ills as harmless—pray for their removal. In us lies hidden virtue from Heaven.

We pray that the sounds of crowing roosters and barking dogs reach all four borders, that the blessings of the *Hongfan* and *Guizhou* be bestowed upon the people. How could there not be ample grace?

If goodness exists but is not acted upon, what use is it?

**Memorial for Celebrating the Five Manifestations and the Buddha’s Birthday**
We recall that when a single Buddha appears in the world, all generations revere him. The three realms, filled with spirits, gather for the assembly of the Five Perfections. Ten thousand gods rejoice, and the four seas look to him in reverence.

We honor the Buddha’s station: through three asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he cultivated merit across ten lifetimes. On the eighth day of the fourth month, the *mingyú* plant blooms with auspiciousness, bestowing blessings from the nine heavens. Once more, the *udumbara* flower appears in splendor. With hands raised to heaven and earth, he vowed to deliver both saints and mortals.

We, your humble servants, owe boundless gratitude, for we know the source of our blessings. Whether registered households or water-dwellers, though the six senses and six desires remain unmastered, once a year we offer thanks. We prepare pure offerings, invite the World-Honored One, and bear witness together in awakening.

We pray that the Tathāgata may manifest—neither defiled nor pure, neither extinguished nor born. May all blessings reach the people—may they live long, prosper, flourish, and thrive.

**Memorial for the Blood Bowl Ritual**
We recall that women, with their five leakages, endure hardship in bearing and raising children. A mother’s tenfold kindness cannot be repaid, even if one were to grind one’s bones to dust. Some mothers are still living yet lack proper care; others have passed, their merits unfulfilled. How can we not reflect on this? Let us return to the root.

As children, we must recognize the bonds of heaven and earth. By the true person’s wisdom and the Supreme’s expedient means, we establish the Blood Bowl Assembly. Following the repentance rites, we perform the twofold ritual—benefiting both the living and the departed, broadly delivering all beings.

The Savior from Suffering, the Heavenly Worthy, is none other than the compassionate patron. Do not dismiss this as unrelated to monks and Daoists. The Tathāgata Śākyamuni declared himself the reincarnation of Laozi—his merits are inconceivable.

There is no evil in that realm, nor weariness in this. Without concern for gain or accomplishment, we build this bridge, that all may cross and receive its seal as proof. May all turn in reverence, and may every assembly be complete.

From the Floating Black Soil emerges a pearl of millet, no farther than five *zhang* away. The Feathered State’s pond transforms into a lotus throne, ever present within the heart’s square inch.

To express sincerity, we humbly submit this account.

**Memorial for the Daoist Master’s Enthronement in the Luo Tian Jiao Ritual**
We recall the imperial decree of jade, bestowing honor upon the master. Two silver seals—what joy to receive such imperial favor! Never before has this been seen; today, we witness it.

Though will can pierce stone, the body feels light while the feet grow heavy. Reborn, one is not worth half a coin. Yet we hear that good deeds multiply—why not pray for blessings like those of the Kaiyuan era, when bells were cast?

Let no restraint be placed upon the Zhongtong-era literary drafts, that they may ever exist and ever endure, bringing all things to their proper beginning and end. I shall strive to ascend the pole’s summit, while you need not forge iron to serve as a threshold.

Back and forth across two thousand *li* of roads, this karmic affinity is no mere chance. Up and down through seven or eight years, this merit surpasses all former merit. If a virtuous thought arises, let joyful heart follow.

**Memorial for the Daoist Master’s Investiture of the Immortal’s Tablet**
We humbly observe that the Perfected One of Numinous Aid has received the Celestial Master’s provincial document, graced with imperial favor, bestowed a noble title, and exalted in incense and devotion. Though the matters be vast, the rites must not be lacking. With this humble memorial, we reverently knock upon the gates of the lofty, praying that this opportunity of karmic affinity be fulfilled—thus shall boundless merit be attained.

For four hundred years, the temple’s offerings have endured. Mount Ao’s numinous manifestations, the celestial seal of sixteen characters, and the phoenix-script forming its chapters—all evoke the sighs of yellow-haired children and white-haired elders, the reverence of officials and gentlemen. Joy abounds, and multitudes come forth. Thus we extend our sincerest entreaty, for who could doubt the efficacy of seeking the divine?

Half the face, all familiar—yet at the first word, speech falters. This affinity cannot be without cost.
The Dragon-Tiger blessed land lies no less than twenty stages away. Musk and rare incense are no mere pinch of dust.
To seek affairs beyond heaven, one must spend wealth of the world.
Those who have set their hearts, and those who have not—each must regard with true sincerity.
When the hand is ready to extend, let it extend; laugh at those who hesitate and falter.
We dare not demand beyond what is due, yet neither shall we let past opportunities pass again.
We pray that names inscribed may ascend the Buddha’s pagoda, rising layer upon layer, ever higher.
Gazing upon the sacred, emulating the divine—Mount Song’s majesty—we call ten thousand years, ten thousand years, and again ten thousand years.
Below, we cultivate human affairs; above, we repay the nation’s grace.
Though these humble words lack refinement, let them not be refused on account of their plainness.

Moreover:
At the outset of affairs, all follow with eager steps. Yet when faced with wealth, some falter in speech, hesitating to speak.
The glory of this document shines resplendent, revered as if the divine stood at our side.
Who lacks joyful intent? Each harbors a heart of offering.
Though past contributions were not few, they were spent as swiftly as they came.
If the plea for alms cannot be repeated, with whom shall we consult? Why have we come, if not for this? The urgency is plain.
Those who once pledged must not betray their word. Those who now inscribe need not speak of later regrets.
When good deeds are completed, all blessings shall follow.

The Daoist Liao, who befriended Han Yu, learned goodness from others.
Mengchang Jun was not reproached by Feng Huan—no debt shall remain unpaid.

**Memorial for the Celestial Master’s Bestowal of Registers and Establishment of the Jiao Ritual**
To ward off disaster and repel calamity is the unerring duty of the divine.
Upright and enlightened, seeking blessings and invoking favor—this is the common desire of all.
Though the Creator leaves no trace, the Dao’s methods hold their own karmic affinity.
Reverently, for the Numinous Aid Perfected, we receive the Great Cavern’s precious registers—above, to announce to heaven and invoke the sage; below, to protect the nation and pacify the people.
We must rely on rites to dispel demons and guard the true, paving the path to attaining the Dao and ascending to perfection.
Great virtue cannot be surpassed; the common folk, too, shall benefit.
The dragon steeds’ saddles remain secure; their gallop unerring.
Breaking reeds for rafts, the cost reaches a hundred thousand.
Black oxen and yellow calves, each abide in their tasks.
May the Nine Virtues of the Great Norm be fulfilled, and the blessings of the Nine-Five sovereign descend.
Let all pour forth their hearts to accomplish this good work.

**Memorial for the Sculpting of the Perfected’s Return to the Dao’s Attire**
We reverently observe that the Numinous Aid Perfected, having ascended to immortality, must be adorned in immortal raiment.
Of old, the robe and tablet were the state’s favor; now, boots and bamboo hat suit the times.
Neither can be discarded—let both be preserved. Yet neither can remain unchanged; thus, we establish a new hall within.
To sculpt the image of the Dark Sage is to embody the Dao itself.
A crown of azure clouds, a fan of soaring feathers—blending the true form, no human effort alone could achieve this.
Should there be benefactors moved to assist, their merit shall be beyond measure.
Once, in the Yuan and Ming, the true body manifested, its purple-golden form witnessed by all.
In an instant, it vanished without trace. Why cling to a clay semblance? Yet in adorning the spirit to resemble the spirit, it must meet the mark.
Of old, serving in Jin, he wore the robes of Liang’s favor. Now, enshrined in Lu, he dons the cap of Zhang Fu.
Though imitating the fashions of the age, he cannot escape external judgment.
Having received heaven’s favor, his attire must accord with the Nine Chapters.
This requires human contribution—could it be without cost? Let benefactors and patrons each bring forth treasures, pledging their hearts to accomplish this.
The merit shall be great. Reverence lies herein, not in mere appearances.
We reverently pray for the present emperor’s longevity, equal to heaven’s.
May all under heaven bow to the imperial crown, and the myriad lands offer tribute.
May the hundred barbarians don robes and sashes.

**Memorial for the Sculpting of the Divine Image at Qingkou**
The two peaks stand majestic; of old, Mount Ao claimed six lands, gazed upon by all four directions.
Now, the new mound at Qingkou is dismissed as a humble shrine. Yet the divine, vast in power, remains indestructible in true form—this image is but clay, shaped by human hands.
Empty words suffice not; let donations be recorded to clarify.
Consider the artisans—no two possess the same skill. Having stepped forward, let them extend their hands.
All who tend the incense and flame are disciples—let none speak of great or small.
At the ripening of the rice harvest, we shall surely see sevenfold, eightfold abundance.
Though these words are coarse and unrefined, let the good work be completed.

**Memorial for Robes and Attire**
The divine is the people’s lord—how could it not think of them?
Clothing is the body’s adornment; it must befit its wearer.
Moreover, the Numinous Aid Temple is known as the shrine of the upright god—its patched robes are unseemly.
Zixia’s shame at his frayed sleeves deeply shamed Confucius’ sageliness.
The years have passed—why not renew the boots and bamboo hat?
Circumstances demand it; let none say the cap and shoes are misplaced.
In times of war, millet and beans are set aside; sable and cicada ornaments come from the mirror’s reflection.
Adapting to the times—who could say it is wrong?
We have disciples with whom to speak; let great benefactors arise with joyful hearts.
A hundred expenses are not easily met—a single coin is still an offering.
Every stitch and thread requires effort. Gathering fur makes a fur coat—let all contribute their strength.
With the five colors displayed, may abundant blessings extend to the multitudes.

**Moreover:**
Crimson shoes and star-crowned caps, bowing to the Han gods.
The Celestial Master’s favor—Zhang Fu’s cap and Confucian robes.
This is no land of Yue; to imitate foreign dress would be to don outlandish garb.
Ashamed of the worn, quilted robe, we seek brocade to cover it.
Why wait for cold to seek furs? Let us play our part as the scene demands.
Though a hundred holes and a thousand tears cannot be mended, a thousand stitches and ten thousand threads still require effort.

"To say it comes again is not worth a single coin.
This time, a [missing character]—how could it be for great expense?
Since it is neither ghostly tribute nor heavenly rain, let it bring joy to gods and delight to men.
Moreover, in this year of joyous counsel and abundant harvest, why empty the mushroom stores or overturn the granaries? How could we follow the waves of others?
We must dust our caps and straighten our robes—blessings never tire of cultivation, and words leave no room for later dispute.

**Memorial on the Replacement of the Perfected One’s Stolen Robes**

Prostrating, we, descendants of the Five Dynasties’ marquises and kings, revere integrity as divine and honor our thousand-year parents.
In our village, without cause, the sacred headdress was violated. Due to the poor who disregard righteousness, even the virtuous have lost their dignity.
They stripped the robes from the seat of honor, stole the implements of incense and flame, daring to deceive in the unseen darkness—calamity follows those who ignore past ruin.
Though they claim the dead of night knows no witness, they cannot escape the disaster of a single dawn.
All who tend this shrine must not bring shame upon the gods.
Let us unite in a plan to cover the loss; do not惜 the expense of undoing this wrong.
May the hopes of the multitude be fulfilled as in the old statutes.
With brushstrokes swift as clouds, success shall come in no time.
Let there be awe-inspiring might and a model worthy of emulation—gazing upon it, none shall forget.
He who accumulates good meets with fortune; he who accumulates evil meets with misfortune—retribution never fails.

*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Twelve Concluded*
*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Thirteen*"

**A Letter to Lord Dongcun**

The gods manifest their presence, proclaiming themselves through writings. Yet I, unworthy, cannot compose verses like those for the zither-playing spirit of Xiang, nor dare I presume to expound on the *Yi* as one buried in a tomb. My leaky roof brings shame, and my well-bound view leaves me ignorant. Though I may possess a single scrap of foolish insight, it remains beneath even the lowest of the Three Histories. Now, having been judged in the monthly critiques, I pray you will not fault me as the *Spring and Autumn* does.

The illustrious title of Lingji has endured over four hundred years, its transmission long unbroken. Master Tongzhen underwent ninety-four transformations—who dares claim to understand them? Though fame and profit may differ, literary merit naturally invites public consensus. It is only because Heaven does not withhold the Dao and Earth does not hoard its treasures that the Yellow River yields its chart and the Luo River its writings. Knowing the gods’ designs, one acts upon the slightest sign. The sage does not speak of the uncanny, and the nobleman harbors no doubt. Seen, it is invisible; heard, it is silent—without sound or scent. Vast beyond containment, minute beyond division, it transforms and thus endures. In essence, the upright depend on humanity, while fortune and misfortune, regret and shame lie as plain as the palm. The ancients were swayed by the winds, yet they were people of harmony and humility. In this degenerate age, where are the gentlemen of ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame? This too is the concern of those who grieve for the Dao—how could I be merely playing with words?

Since the matter is just, why seek others? Empty words are no match for practicing the Dao. To sacrifice to what is not a ghost is flattery; to fulfill one’s intent without self-deception is true sincerity.

I reverently consider your esteemed self, who unites the manifest and the hidden, delving into the profound and the obscure. Your towering presence stands like a thousand-fathom cliff; your vast qi sweeps away armies with a brushstroke. Long have I admired the talents of the Prince of Teng, and now I rashly replace the request for the Luo Chi Stele with this plea, fearing even Bo Jie might pale in comparison. Fortunately, like Su Zizhan, I dare not refuse outright. Relying on your magnanimity as an elder, I am honored by the elegant verses you bestowed upon my daughter and grandson. With the temple’s renovation, the inscribed stone shall be glorified, becoming a model for all ages and a crown for the four directions.

Words cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning; I merely convey this sentiment in brief. Greatness is called sagely, and sageliness divine. One must repay virtue—pray refine my words, and do not leave them unpolished like a neglected wall.

**A Petition from the Villagers to Lord Dongcun**

This ancient temple has gathered four hundred years of dust. Now, a new stele of one thousand and eighty characters stands, its grandeur resplendent. Though its prose may be heard, like the Dipper and the Literary Star, its influence does not extend far. A journey of a thousand *li* is still possible—how could I have imagined the separation of Shen and Shang, spanning years? Never did I expect today to renege on my earlier words. Once, I sent a cage of geese, not the brush of Wang Xizhi; now, I offer no roasted meat to summon the Master’s carriage. Without the medicine of your counsel, I can only grope blindly. Yet I trust in your lofty virtue, which does not forget friendship in poverty.

You have deigned to favor me with fine words, not dismissing the crude as one might reject blue paired with white. I am ashamed of my vulgar speech, which risks confusing purple with vermilion. Permit me to ask: how might I inscribe my gratitude upon the river of your kindness?

I reverently consider your brilliance, which exhausts the workings of creation. Your learning spans heaven and humanity; your writings surge like vast waters, as profound as Han Yu and more majestic than Sima Qian of the Han. Your renown has long been established, and your accolades are many. The Old Man of Stone Islet is no debt collector, and the Woodcutter of the Mountains only knows how to recite poetry. Though you have bestowed the diligence of a letter, I cannot help but cherish the affection of the *tiepao*. If you show kindness to one like me, who would dare forget the source?

I, a latecomer to learning, am ignorant, my childish mind and meager wit adrift in the illusory and indistinct, devoid of radiant and heroic talent. Yet I have already benefited from your nurturing breath and sheltered beneath your canopy. With respect, I arrange these wild geese in formation, reiterating my private plea. Dare I trouble your carriage to grant this heart a fraction of solace?

**A Letter in Reply to Lord Dongcun**

Some ask: The *Record of Lingji Wang* is the king’s own account. If the king has already recorded it, why does he still eagerly seek others? What is his intent?

Among all things between heaven and earth, none is more numinous than the dragon. Its breath transforms, its wonders unfathomable. Yet what it relies upon to manifest its divinity is the cloud. Without clouds, the dragon cannot display its numinous power. This is the meaning behind my request to you.

With respect, I write to express my gratitude.

When Zhang Lu entered the pass, he was already dead. When Ying Hou was at home, Tao Zhu concealed himself. Though Fan Li changed his name repeatedly, his true visage remained that of Gao and Kui. I know not what books Qi studied, but Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang have transmitted this Dao since antiquity. In haste or turmoil, one must hold fast to it. The subtlest essence lies in grasping the mean—this is the heart behind bequeathing teachings to the world. One must fulfill the rites of honoring parents and serving superiors; for a thousand years, its wonders remain unfathomable. Ninety-four transformations may be heard of, but without form or sound, I dare not answer the questions of ghosts and spirits.

To take righteousness as profit is not the way of the bandit Zhi. Though I possess only mediocre talent, I harbor a lingering attachment. Though the Three Rivers do not respond, a single phrase suffices to convey understanding. Why have you come? There is a reason.

One chaste woman shames the wanton crowd; one capped man humbles the topknotted nine. Though this is the way of the world, does it still possess humaneness? Not illuminating the *Great Learning*’s generation of wealth brings deep disgrace to the *Spring and Autumn*’s forthright brush. In this age, who but you could shoulder this task?

Though one may not be human, humanity is not heaven. One must act in accordance with words, and speak in accordance with deeds.

I reverently consider Lord Dongcun, whose virtue bridges the hidden and the manifest, whose Dao spans the obscure and the luminous. On paper, his clouds and mist evoke the structure of Liu’s bones and Yan’s flesh; in his breast, the vast ocean contains nothing but the sentiments of Zhou and the thoughts of Confucius. Thus, he recognizes today’s right as yesterday’s wrong. Never has there been a case where A approves and B disapproves.

A single word carries weight, upheld by the consensus of many. Why seek outward traces when this is already a matter of subtle influence?

Lord Beishan has sons, grandsons, and generations beyond. —*Postscript by Lord Xiecun*

I am honored by your fine composition, which brings radiance to our ancestral shrine. Reading it again and again, I am suddenly struck with insight. Truly, this is what is meant by "whether wise or unwise, the difference is as great as thirty *li*." If I were to compare myself to Master Tongchuan, that would be beyond my daring. Yet I shall place your *Dao Inscription* by my seat, so that future visitors to this hall may read these words, envision your person, and—like seeing a tiger’s pelt—know the roar that once shook the mountain forests and made all beasts tremble.

—*Letter from Lord Xiecun*

Recalling the poems you sent in your sleeve, I remember our brief encounter, where I glimpsed but half your refined bearing. Now, entrusted with composing this record, I behold once more your extraordinary presence—fivefold in its brilliance. Though I long to sweep the path before your gate, I have not yet had the chance. To hold the whip as your attendant would be to gaze upon a towering mountain. My heart holds you in deepest esteem; to know you is to meet Jingzhou—just as I have always wished. Not to have encountered the Lord of Lu is simply fate.

I reverently consider Your Honor, the Prefectural Judge, a man of our native district, advanced in years yet blessed with the vitality of Shao, his hidden virtues sustained by divine favor. His mastery of the classics and cultivation of conduct embody the legacy of the Duke of Zhou’s descendants. His wealth enriches the state, surpassing the achievements of Yan Ying and Guan Zhong. His learning and scholarship surpass others, while his official rank is but a secondary matter. Having found joy in the company of Lord Dongcun, why should he not also wander the wilds?

I dare to bow in humble reverence, grateful to have found recognition in this day. The inscription for the shrine is elegant, its thousand words a testament to refinement. Already, it circulates among the people, its praise enduring for generations, all flowing from your breast. This is no mere carved dragon on paper; even my crude and rustic talent cannot grasp the force of your acclaim. The numinous responds, and the village shrine shines with splendor.

A gentleman forgives others’ shortcomings; even the smallest gift carries weight, its intent as light as a goose feather yet spanning a thousand *li*. I humbly present this pair of carp as a token of my diligence. Your words are worth a thousand gold, and in return, I offer this white goose in gratitude. Deeply ashamed of my rough draft, I can only hope for your indulgence. I respectfully command my ink-brush scribe to gaze upon the thousand volumes of history.

—*Letter on Behalf of the Local Community from Lord Xiecun*

Han Zihua was praised by the Duke of Holding the State—this is the honor due a scholar-official of our time. Xie Lingyun never dreamed of Hui Lian; how then could he have composed those sublime lines by the pond? Where there is such a brother, there must be such a spirit. I revere the man, and thus I revere the deity.

You have deigned to lower yourself to one so unworthy, a great talent bestowing favor. Long have I cherished your humility and virtue, never daring to forget your kindness. All say that the elder brother’s judgment is sound, yet it is truly your guidance that steers us. After three years of offering, I lament my own inadequacy. Even a meager meal, once spoken of by you, gains weight. How dare I borrow a thousand gold? Yet your praise, like the words of a trusted friend, moves me deeply.

I reflect that I have idled in my village, retreating to the mountains. Though poor, I have never changed my countenance. Wherever my gourd bowl has taken me, I have never presumptuously presented my name. Long have I basked in the lingering grace of your river’s bounty, bound as we are by the vines of kinship. Beyond this, I have no other requests, nor do I know what else to do.

I reverently consider you, a man of renowned lineage, a rare talent of our age. Your breast brims with noble aspirations, your brush flows with vast and boundless prose. I am deeply ashamed that my humble gate cannot accommodate a carriage of four horses. I respectfully offer this letter with utmost reverence, though I am unworthy even of its paper and ink.

Your many acts of kindness have long been known, and I have heard of your reputation as a military adjutant. The temple’s renewal is entirely due to the efforts of Governor Yu. This fulfills my wishes, and I offer these words in gratitude.

—*Letter to Commander Zhang*

I prostrate myself in awe, considering how your bold arguments in the court have secured a legacy for a thousand autumns, and how your strategies within the command tent have earned you the enfeoffment of ten thousand households. Your exemplary conduct endures, ensuring prosperity for generations to come. I dare to present my name, seeking an audience before the court. Your humble inquiries are without shame, and the songs of the people attest to your virtue.

I reverently consider Your Honor, the Commander-in-Chief, whose *qi* is vast and unyielding, whose nature embraces benevolence. You govern the people with a parent’s heart and judge affairs with divine clarity. Grievances vanish like thorns cleared from the thicket, while virtuous deeds flourish like sweet pear trees. Your upright governance stands unmatched among the seven prefectures of southern Min. Your noble bearing soars above all, and all gaze upon you as the North Star among men.

Your learning is as deep as the ocean, your scholarship as splendid as the blossoms of the literati. Your brush wields creation itself, conjuring wind and clouds upon the page. Long have I heard of the two peerless talents in your court, and I rejoice in this gathering of shared culture. Your legal acumen rivals that of Cui and Du, still praised to this day. Your critiques of Ou and Yu leave no room for reproach. The gates of your hundred-*li* city stand magnificent, and the thousand-year-old ornamental pillars are renewed.

How admirable! How excellent! I prostrate myself in reflection: I am but a child from a remote village, born in a thatched hut, yearning to behold the pure light of wind and moon, having once sat in the lingering glow of rivers and streams. Now, in this village of accumulated virtue, there stands an old rain-praying temple, repeatedly blessed with divine responses, known as the Spiritually Efficacious Shrine. Its characters are as large as pecks, boldly inscribed and doubly cherished. The inscription is on every tongue, and gratitude for your virtue must be sung anew. This is a grand affair for all time—who would dare to diminish its legacy?

These empty formalities in a wooden box are hardly worthy as gifts. May heaven bless and support you with abundant fortune, fulfilling the sincerity of my prayers. With humble shame and heartfelt gratitude, I offer these words.

—*Letter Requesting an Inscription for the Temple Gate from the Surveillance Commissioner*

The arrival of your carriage in the eight prefectures brings added luster to this blessed land. The Surveillance Bureau, with its solemn governance, extends the protection of heaven itself. I am deeply moved and will never forget this kindness.

I reverently consider Your Honor, the Surveillance Commissioner, a rare talent of our age, a great virtue for our time, whose nature is pure and conduct meticulous. Long has your family been renowned as upright officials in Chengdu. Your heart is upright and your intentions sincere, having personally received the teachings of Master Yichuan. Your lineage has long been praised for its purity, passing down exemplary conduct to your descendants. You uphold the customs of Guān and Luò, making ritual and righteousness the model for Ōu and Mǐn.

Your calligraphy stands unmatched through the ages, your brushwork sweeping away a thousand armies. Lu, Luo, Wang, and Yang are hardly worth mentioning; Ōu, Yu, Chu, and Xue cannot compare.

Truly, your brilliance shines like a beacon, and I humbly submit the sincerity of my earnest devotion.

I reflect with reverence upon myself—a rustic commoner, a humble scholar of the fields, narrow in vision and small in stature, my person attached to ignorance and folly. Yet daring to lift my gaze toward the axe and halberd of your judgment, I venture to present this petition with bowed head.

Here in this village of accumulated virtue stands the ancient Lingji Palace, a sanctuary revered by all the people, where prayers for rain and sunshine have long been answered. I now seek but three characters, though they weigh more than a thousand gold. If you would graciously bestow your wisdom early, my joy would be boundless.

Your Honor’s gate is vast, and I dare once more to present this humble offering, hoping it may reflect even a glimmer of your luminous example. I, a mere well-frog with a child’s understanding, have consulted the oracle again, my ignorance twice over. I can only hope you might deign to consider it, though I cannot fathom the depth of your judgment.

On behalf of the villagers, I present this petition for the Dao’s flourishing at Lingji Palace:

Lingji Palace—what a sacred precinct! A thousand years of incense smoke.
The marketplace of blue cloth teems with people; generations of noble lineages gather.
With shared devotion, we seek to adorn it.
May its august title be honored in the two capitals, its glorious name resound across the four directions.

The writings of later masters that transform the present—those of Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo—cannot surpass this. Ascending to transcendence and verifying sagehood, the teachings of Zheng, Qiao, Wo, and Quan—might one yet hear of them? With the heart set on carrying forth Heaven’s transformative work and the vow sworn to benefit beings and aid others, compassion manifests in myriad forms, and merits defy measure.

The rites of spring sacrifices endure in their observance, yet the duty of morning and evening devotions may lack its proper steward. Thus, through inertia, we have failed to seek out worthy ones. Who, dwelling alone, might deliberate on the Great Harmony? He who takes goodness as his teacher—such as you, sir, a man of aligned resolve and disciplined conduct—commands the collective plea of the multitude, not for my own sake or out of personal favor.

Should you deign to grace us with your presence, the grandeur of the palace gates would shine all the brighter. Again, as iron is transmuted into gold, we rely deeply on your refining power; as a brick cast forth draws forth jade, we bear the weight of your parallel prose. In my recent memorial, I humbly presented a stern simplicity, my gaze fixed on the smallest details, and now, with reverence, I sweep clean my humble abode, awaiting your arrival with hands clasped, ready to receive your radiance with offerings of incense and flowers.

A thousand-year-old marble pillar, home to the swift-returning crane of immortals. A ten-thousand-year Dao sanctuary, a land as majestic as the Six Turtles of antiquity. From all directions, the gaze of the world turns here; by the strength of the many, it is sustained. To manage it, to cultivate it—whose effort is this? From beginning to end, though it be my heart, it is the heart of the villagers. Yet I fear this flourishing may not long endure, and so, with earnest devotion, I make this plea.

Human sentiment is thorough: they say the plum blossoms by the stream are worth a thousand gold. To see this good work completed would surpass even the wealth of Yangzhou’s ten thousand taels. I humbly request that the High Master Tang Zong establish ten thousand assemblies to assess and honor this endeavor. As the assembly of gods and humans spreads its blessings, your name shall suddenly emerge, summoned forth. With respectful deference, I await your esteemed presence.

I hold in deepest reverence so-and-so, a master whose learning flows from profound sources, whose Dao towers like a mountain peak. You grasp the subtlest mysteries of the profound and empty, embodying stillness and non-action. Your mind upholds the strictness of ritual purification, and your strength bolsters the gates of the teaching. From the first, I trusted in your conduct among men. In this age, who but you could lead?

Now, for the sake of Lingji Palace, we propose a Universal Salvation Assembly, to be held on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, with a special ten-day observance. Three days of fasting will precede the nine-morning rites. Externally, the teachings will be expounded; internally, the *Scripture of Salvation* will be recited. I implore you to condescend to your exalted station and preside over the ritual proceedings. Should the souls of the departed find deliverance, this assembly will indeed be illuminated. Looking up, I rely on your wisdom; bowing low, I risk overstepping.

I, dwelling in rustic obscurity, am but a latecomer—what do I know? Though the Dao may be beyond my hearing, the virtuous delight in doing good. Should you graciously descend from your carriage to take your seat, I shall sweep the mat to welcome you. A single boat can ferry one sixty *li*; I shall forever prepare incense for your long journey. Countless people turn to you in devotion—joining the multitude, I shall not be cast aside.

On behalf of the villagers, I petition for the appointment of a lecturer to the capital:

For long have I admired your noble character, not merely for a day. Recently, in discussing the mysteries, I presumptuously knocked at the gate of your cinnabar chamber. You deigned to respond with humility, casting your gaze upon me. Since our parting, this sentiment has never waned.

Now, for the construction of the ritual platform at Lingji Palace, I have conveyed this humble request, entreating you to condescend to travel here. When it comes to the literary style of canonical texts, you are the one the people have chosen. In this age of moral exemplars, who but you could lead? Should you apply the fasting rituals as your own practice, enabling our deities to merge with the likenesses of immortals, how profound would be the blessings bestowed!

The timber of the ridgepole and the pillars of the threshold are not your proper place. Like the vastness of rivers and seas, all streams—even the muddy and stagnant—find their way to you. Should you deign to descend to the altar, I shall hold the broom in readiness.

---

A petition for the appointment of Yue Shan as temple warden:

I, who respond to circumstances to benefit beings, have yet to open the gate of skillful means. Pushing aside the grasses to seek the mysteries, I long to behold the depths of true emptiness. You have graciously taken notice of me, yet for long I have proffered my card in vain, blocked by the long barrier of the western gorge, gazing toward the northern mountains in yearning. Now, having received your command, how dare I not act as your humble disciple?

The divine and enlightened cannot be fathomed—this petty one shall do his best to respond. Were it not for the precepts of the Venerable Master Chonggui, how could Pang the Layman display his spiritual powers? The *Record of the Pavilion of Great Compassion* is now complete; I dare to reveal my Eastern Slope visage. The Dao sanctuary of Caoxi is no small matter—why not take up the Sixth Patriarch’s koan?

Why has the Venerable Master Chonglin come? The Old Man of the Stone Path will surely not cast me aside. Fearing that the golden root may be misaligned, I still seek the jade axe to refine it. Should you deign to take this as your topknot and robe, it would be like moving an old case to this neglected thatch. I offer but a cluster of gourds and a bolt of fine silk, a modest gift like the purple bamboo shoots of Huzhou.

May your Dharma eye open wide; my private sentiments need not be spoken.

---

A congratulatory address on the appointment of Lu Shan:

...

Humbly I recall how the Venerable Master of Guangshun once ascended the jade steps of the imperial court, and how the Xiantong Chan Monastery was graced with the honor of a golden edict and inscribed plaque. What has shone before must surely return in its beginning.

With reverence I consider the Venerable Master of White Deer: the world is drenched in his Dharma rain, the fragrance of compassion fills the rocky cliffs—truly a superior person, blessed with the marks of virtue and power. I look up in awe at the boundless imperial favor, and bow in respect at the proclamation of his appointment. Scaling the lofty peak, he climbs the clouded heavens of the ten thousand years; his voice resounds, "Long live the Emperor!" The great monastery adorns the blessed land of the Three Mountains. His renown weighs upon the Three Mountains, and with a shout he scatters the wild foxes beyond the fields. Joyfully encountering the pair of deer before the hall, the monastic groves stand in solemn order, and the neighboring villages gleam with splendor.

I reflect that I, in my humble station, am without ability, though our bond has long been established. How dare I, with my insubstantial and empty words, venture to approach the wondrous workings of his spiritual powers? Though his name is inscribed upon the pagoda and his writings manifest in his deeds, yet in advancing step by step, his strength surpasses others. Since the Dharma’s cause is no mere accident, the Dao sanctuary will naturally flourish. I now offer my congratulations, never forsaking compassion. Having been graced by the honor of his elephant-borne visitation, I pray he may reveal the sacred auspice of the green waterfowl. For a thousand years, this temple must receive the Buddha’s confirmation. With a single wisp of heart’s incense, one ought to join palms in reverence.

My written words are few, but my devotion runs deep. I humbly present this verse:

Upon the rain-drenched peak he sits,
His wondrous powers vast and deep.
Rejoicing in the weight of royal grace,
His name soars high o’er Ten-Thousand-Year Peak.

*Postscript of Inquiry by Zhou Shenggong*

This Zhou Shenggong is the finest of our hometown—a true "white eyebrow." The common saying goes, "Scholars are often ill-fated," and indeed it rings true. His four-six parallel prose seeks some response, yet this is beyond even my three-fold experience; I can only reply with a few brief points.

All mountains, forests, rivers, valleys, and hills are called *shen*—spirits—yet the Three Offerings hold particular solemnity in the rites. When yin and yang, wind and rain, brightness and darkness lose their proper rhythm, the Six Excesses are already warned against in medical texts. Ashamed of my lack of the mountain spirit’s efficacy, I have instead invited the river demon’s mockery, left speechless and unable to defend myself. What transgression have I committed? One may discern the truth in the end, yet might not misfortune and fortune still confound?

The tortoise does not weary of me; I rely solely on the first divination’s omen. The horse cannot speak, yet I dare inscribe the words "peace" in seal script. The yellow bear appears in dreams—dreams born of thought. The red snake transforms into a shadow—yet even shadows may be doubted.

These are all the toils of spirit and thought, leading to calloused hands and feet. The illness, long afflicted by frost and dew, is a calamity without cause. The moon now lodges in *Dou* and *Niu*—whose fault is this? If Heaven wills it, what can be done about fate?

As the common saying goes, "The Master does not speak of the uncanny." Yet I have humbly received the brush’s sharp reproach, and deeply shamed the wooden scholar’s lack of letters. Forty-nine years of delusion—only now do I glimpse Qu Boyu’s regret. Twelve thousand breaths of *qi*—yet never have I heard the name of Wang Shuhe.

I would rise from nine deaths to a single life’s remnant, to master the teachings of *Yongming’s* seven charts and eight wrappings. Though a hundred medicines have been tried in hope of some chance success, if even one man remains unhealed, it is called your failure. Why must you overturn and declare, "There is that which stands with Heaven and rains upon Earth"? The people of Yue revere reproach; the people of Chu revere ghosts—can their customs not be changed? The *Wei* stomach’s obstruction, the *Qi* stomach’s blockage—what use are those physicians?

Having not repeated the same error, I may yet take one more journey. I regularly rub the jade sphere—who reads the *Heji Jue*? Moreover, the parallel prose of four-six rhythms is itself a masterpiece.

Having consulted the oracle again and again, I glimpse at last the true circumstances. There comes a time when no medicine is needed—yet how can brush and ink suffice to record it? Your prayers have been long and earnest; what more could you say? Since your kindness has pressed me so, I cannot refuse.

Though the broken-arm prophecy proved true, it did no harm to the benevolence of Yang Shu. Though the lost-axle kin were unharmed, it did not diminish the renown of Lou Shide. Twice have I sent letters of mourning, each time shamed by your commands. Though a gentleman may grieve in adversity, must he assume the guise of a petty man?

If Heaven does not summon me back, what can Bo Liao do against fate? For great renown must endure the trials of the altar’s pit, and dark spirits often rise in the wake of lingering illness. What crime has the crane committed? When will the phoenix’s forging be complete? Even a lame tortoise may yet take one more journey; the bedridden rooster can still reconnect. Yet I fear the mockery of “washing feet and losing wealth,” and dread the reproach of “extending a hand only to cast the next stone.”

Since you have spoken to me so earnestly, I recall your footsteps with joy. To repay enmity with virtue—even the old fist finds no surfeit. Strive in learning and conduct, and may you never forget your former steps. To share another’s sorrows and rejoice in their joys—even Confucius and Mencius found this hard to articulate. To drown where others drown, to hunger where others hunger—this was the vow of Yu and Ji.

To skillfully save all things is to waste nothing. To speak when one can speak is to never misspeak. To seek a six-foot vine, one must first cultivate three-year mugwort.

My reply, written in haste, still harbors the fear of a bladder’s rupture. I would rush out in bare feet to welcome you, yet wait for your carriage’s arrival. I raise my whip in gratitude—why hesitate to follow in your steps?

**Marriage Proposal for the White-Water Bridge Alliance**
I recall that our two families, having borne sons as clever as paired fish, now unite for a second generation. The oracle confirms the harmony of the mating phoenix. The Zhus and Chens share an old bond; the Zhengs and Weis renew a long affection. We pledge by the green mountains and swear by the white waters. The karmic cause is now fulfilled—how fortunate we are!

Moreover, your granddaughter’s virtue follows the legacy of her forebears, delighting in the zither’s charm like Bian of old. My grandson, raised on poetry and books, has yet to wield his brush to compose. Though this is a matter of kinship, why should age be a barrier? She may serve as Huang’s matchmaker, and all will call her the true wife of Liang.

Speak of love only when the time is right, offering fern and artemisia in dutiful service. As rites value simplicity, I humbly prepare hazelnuts and chestnuts to announce the betrothal. My modest gifts are listed on the right—with respect, I present this proposal for your consideration. May your esteemed kindness deign to reflect upon it.

**Raising the Ridgepole Address**
As the Three Mountains converge, all proclaim this blessed land of great peace. From a single vein of lineage, the Dao’s gate follows the hidden path. Now, entrusted with the duty of the ancestral hall, we complete the work of building a home. The oracle and tortoise shell align with the auspicious hexagram; the people’s fondness for magpies and crows manifests as omens upon the roof.

With reverence, I consider [Name], who carries on the family legacy, his name sung in praise. In his hand, the jade tablet emerges from the brush’s artistry; in his heart, he holds the framework’s grand design. From a single household’s affairs, we rejoice in the splendor of the twin-petal tower. Sheltered within a hundred *li*, we celebrate the glory of the flowery county.

One day’s renewal brings ten thousand years of magnificence. As a humble craftsman, I dare not claim great wisdom. Following the given path, I plan and construct—how could I presume to saw or hew at will? In the marketplace of gold, they vie to boast of Fan Li’s wealth. Before the hall of colorful robes, I wish to emulate Lao Lai’s play.

Let me offer the sparrow’s modest congratulations for the new hall, and ascend the rainbow’s high ridgepole. As the poem says:
*Like you, the timber is fit for ridgepole and beam—*
*Yet it still requires skillful carving.*
*A great mansion shelters ten thousand, vast in its refuge,*
*And in the courtyard, we rejoice in the triple sophora’s shade.*

The ancestral temple’s solemn rites have been observed for four hundred years,
The first month’s harmony begins on the fifteenth night—the Lantern Festival’s feast and revelry.

Hundreds of ancestors and ten thousand generations ascend the Vermilion Palace.

Eight-colored radiance illuminates the eight directions.

Hearing the scriptures and listening to the Dharma, together we arouse compassion,
Sharing food and clothing, all equally enjoy warmth and sustenance.

The Blood Bowl Assembly—Mulian repays his mother’s kindness, his filial piety reaching through heaven and earth, his divine powers unmatched;
Earth Treasury presides as Teaching Master, his Dharma pervading the worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, the Three Thousands.
