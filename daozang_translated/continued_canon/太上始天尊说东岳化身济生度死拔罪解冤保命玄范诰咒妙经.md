**The Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Eastern Peak’s Transformation Body for Salvation, Deliverance from Death, Expiation of Sins, Resolution of Grievances, and Protection of Life—The Mysterious Model, Declarations, and Divine Incantations**

**Scripture Title:** *The Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s Scripture of the Eastern Peak’s Transformation Body for Salvation, Deliverance from Death, Expiation of Sins, Resolution of Grievances, and Protection of Life—The Mysterious Model, Declarations, and Divine Incantations*
(Author unknown; approximately dated to the Ming dynasty. Pseudepigraphically attributed to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, expounding to the Golden Flower Perfected and others the methods of revering and prostrating to the Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks for disaster elimination, sin expiation, salvation, and deliverance from death. One fascicle. Base text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*. Also found in the *Daoist Canon Compendium*, Shi collection.)

---

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided within the Golden Gates of the Great Brahma Heaven, in the Jade Purity Sacred Realm’s Heavenly Palace. Ascending the Nine Radiance Treasure Throne, wielding the Five Brilliance Ruyi, he convened the myriad Heavenly Sovereigns, the sun, moon, and stellar hosts, and the boundless perfected immortals and sacred assemblies, all arrayed before the Dao.

Then, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy emitted a great and vast sound, expounding the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dharma. Heavenly blossoms scattered in profusion, and jade-like incense wafted in coils.

Among the assembly were four great perfected ones: the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Golden Flower Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Jade Purity Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Wondrous Conduct Perfected, and the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Savior from Suffering Perfected. Each stepped forth from their ranks, knelt in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying:

“We observe that within the world below, in the Nine Dark Hells, there are men and women of all ages who, though they have perished in the mortal realm, suffer from poverty, hardship, and distress; lingering illnesses; demonic and spectral afflictions; karmic transgressions and curses; misfortunes, disasters, and legal entanglements; years of poisonous harm; and untimely, violent deaths.

We further see that within the hells, the hungry ghosts and forsaken souls endure ceaseless torment day and night—blades on wheels, trees of swords, scorching flames, and freezing ice—without respite. Again, in the Blood Pool Hell, countless women endure myriad sufferings, unceasing day and night. Why do these two paths of beings suffer such differing karmic causes? We beseech the Heavenly Compassion to open wide the gate of expedient means and broadly reveal the path of cultivation.”

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy replied: “Return to your positions and listen carefully to the wondrous sound. I shall expound it all for you.

The beings of the world do not believe in the karmic retribution of good and evil. Some disrespect Heaven and Earth, are disloyal to their sovereigns, unfilial to their parents, and irreverent toward their teachers and elders. They defy divine principles, rebel against their brothers, relatives, neighbors, and friends, act duplicitously, and harbor deceit in their hearts. For all such transgressions, the divine officials and sacred assemblies of the Peak Prefecture have already recorded and examined their sins day and night, verifying their truth.

Thus, in their lifetimes, they suffer poverty, hardship, and distress; malignant diseases, sores, and poisons; epidemics and ailments; disasters and misfortunes; legal entanglements and imprisonment; demonic and spectral harm; years of unrelenting calamity; and an inability to find peace. Their households are plagued by misfortune, and they frequently encounter funerals and disasters. They may suffer from wars, fires, floods, locusts, famines, and banditry, rarely witnessing peace.

After death, they forever descend into hell, sinking into the realm of hungry ghosts, where their bodies are dismembered, boiled in cauldrons, and subjected to freezing ice. Only after countless kalpas do they escape the cycle of rebirth, only to be reborn as animals and endure slaughter. Such karmic retribution knows no end.”

Upon hearing this, the four great perfected ones were filled with sorrow and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We implore your compassion to equally save and deliver them.”

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the perfected ones, saying:

“Before the division of primordial chaos, prior to the Supreme Ultimate, there was the Primordial Dao Mother who transmitted to the Most High Mi Luo, the Radiant Heavenly Mysterious Origin, the Ancestral Qi of the Golden Wheel and the Lesser Sea’s Foundational Source. Born in a dream of sunlight on the twenty-eighth day of the moon’s cycle, he was the younger brother of the Purple Palace’s Eastern Florescence Sage. He established merit on Mount Changbai, received his title from the Fuxi Emperor, and was first known as the Perfected of Mount Taihua. During the Han, he became the Marshal of Mount Tai, and through successive dynasties, he was enfeoffed as the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak.

His qi responds to the Green Yang, his position reveres the Thunder trigram, and he alone resides in the central realm, governing the myriad spirits. He holds authority over the good and evil of the human world and oversees the judgments of right and wrong in the netherworld. He presides over seventy-two administrative bureaus, metes out punishments across thirty-six peaks, punishes the wicked, records deaths, and registers births. Transforming into the Four Peaks and the Four Heavenly Sacred Emperors, he nurtures the myriad beings of the Six Directions.

If there are good men and good women in the world who, upon encountering the Three Origins, Five La Festivals, the four seasons, eight solar terms, the Jiazi and Gengshen days, the third and seventh days of each month, the descent of the Dipper on their natal day, or the auspicious dawns of the new and full moons, are able to offer wealth and establish altars, abundantly present offerings, burn incense, light lamps, and sincerely pray, prostrating to the Eastern Florescence Supreme Minister, the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor, the Majestic and Free Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Peak, then the nation will know peace, the people will rejoice, wars will cease, and harvests will be abundant. The palace will be serene, and the imperial domain will be secure.

Extending to the common people—men and women—their sins will be eradicated, disasters will be washed away, blessings will accrue, and their years will be prolonged. Their households will flourish, and their descendants will be numerous. In all their comings and goings, they will encounter only auspiciousness.

The deceased of the past will bypass hell, their sins and grievances dissolved, their enmities reconciled, and their sufferings healed. The Nine Dark Hells will cease their trials, the Five Sufferings will halt their punishments, and they will ascend to Heaven, enjoying boundless freedom and joy, uniting with the Dao. All sentient beings will attain the supreme.”

Then he spoke the incantation:

With utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:

The Seventy-Five Bureaus.

By decree, the deities of the eastern corridors and western wings, the Ten Great Guardians, attend at the hall’s fore; the Dragon and Tiger Divine Lords stand guard to left and right. Swiftly they report and respond, distinguishing good and evil along two paths. In the courts of yang and yin, they adjudicate the Three Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, recording the merits of officials, generals, and ministers; determining the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death; distinguishing humans, ghosts, spirits, and demons; and the myriad beings born of womb, egg, moisture, and transformation. Every matter is referred to the clerks; each case belongs to the underworld officials. Their judgments never cease; their assessments never rest. O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Forbearance, Great Benevolence—Peak Court’s Provincial and Departmental Clerks, Mount Tai’s Bureaucratic Officials.

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning proclaimed this incantation and the Ten Titles. All the hosts of heaven and perfected beings universally extolled and revered them, exclaiming, “Excellent indeed!”

Then the Celestial Worthy addressed the Four Perfected Ones, saying: “Whenever kings, emperors, empresses, palace attendants, prefectural and county magistrates, officials, and common people encounter the outbreak of warfare, the rise of bandits, locusts, droughts, floods, red rats swarming the cities, or rampant epidemics—if they recite this scripture, they shall attain peace throughout the realm, winds and rains in harmony, abundant harvests of the five grains, and a contented populace.

If one is imprisoned in shackles and fetters, long confined in dungeons—if they recite this scripture, they shall immediately receive pardon and be freed from their bonds.

If one is afflicted by baleful stars or chronic illness—if they recite this scripture, auspicious stars shall shine forth, and disasters and sufferings shall vanish.

If one seeks official rank or promotion, desiring to display merit and fame—if they recite this scripture, they shall attain advancement in emolument and position, ascending to high office.

If one is impoverished and suffering, praying for wealth and abundance—if they recite this scripture, they shall obtain ample riches, and clothing and food shall come naturally.

If one is childless, widowed, orphaned, or solitary—if they recite this scripture, the Nine Heavens shall rejoice, sending infants to be embraced, conceived, and born. They shall bear intelligent and elegant sons, ensuring descendants for generations without end.

If one’s household is in decline, assailed by malevolent spirits—if they recite this scripture, their gates shall flourish, and evil spirits shall vanish.

If one undertakes construction or divination, failing to meet an auspicious time and offending the earth deities or yearly spirits, causing chickens and dogs to behave strangely and calamities to arise—if they recite this scripture, the earth taboos shall return to their abodes, and the household shall enjoy peace.

Moreover, if one suffers from grievances, curses, or malevolent hexes—if they recite this scripture, these shall be dissolved and dispelled.

If one travels, engages in commerce, or manages affairs—if they recite this scripture, their movements shall be harmonious, their journeys safe on water and land, their official paths unimpeded, and their endeavors successful.

If one recites this scripture for deceased parents, ancestors, relatives, or wandering souls, the departed shall attain rebirth in the Pure Lands and forever enjoy bliss.

Those who recite this scripture must fast, bathe, don fresh clean garments, and sit upright to recite clearly. Then the benevolent deities of the Five Peaks shall advocate for them, and the hosts of the Ten Heavens shall protect them.

Furthermore, if devout men and women earnestly pray and invite Orthodox Unity Daoist priests to recite this scripture—whether in temples, monasteries, or at home, lighting lamps and offering fruit, reciting ten times or even dozens or hundreds of times—their prayers shall be fulfilled as desired.

If one can relinquish wealth without reluctance, printing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of copies of this scripture according to their means, distributing them widely, and circulating them for recitation so all may know and hear—then the Sagely Emperors of the Five Peaks shall command the seventy-two civil and military officials, the sagely families of the Peak Court’s palaces, to protect and support those who print and distribute the scripture, bestowing blessings, prolonging life, dispelling misfortunes, and resolving past and present transgressions. The nation’s foundation shall endure, harvests shall be abundant, the living shall be at peace, and the departed shall transcend suffering.

This scripture’s merit and virtue are boundless. Its profound model expands; do not lightly disclose it. Be cautious.

Thereupon, the Celestial Worthy again proclaimed the sagely lineage of the Peak, causing you to awaken, and spoke this verse:

The Formless, Nameless, Boundless Ancestor,
Abstruse and dim, the numinous of Great Void.
The Perfectly Real, non-dual, naturally revered,
Silently operates the Mysterious Origin, dwelling in the highest rank.
Governing the ten directions within a millet grain,
Pervading the eight extremities, embracing all beings.
The Jade Emperor of the Numinous Dao of the Void Sovereign,
Expounding and transmitting the scripture, unfolding the profound model.
The Turning Dipper and Winnowing Basket traverse sun and moon,
Radiance universally illuminating, boundlessly vast.

The Primordial Sovereign of Chaos descends to the mortal realm,
The Boundless Savior, Master of the Three Teachings.
In the West, Golden Immortals transform the Flowing Sands,
In the East, the Sage Confucius instructs through the ages.
Thirty-two hundred kalpas of cultivation,
The Pure and Serene Awakened King, the Tathāgata Buddha.
The Supreme Lord of Infinite Kalpas, the Maitreya Ancestor,
The Boundless and Immeasurable Great Heavenly Worthy.
The Supreme Mystery, the Non-Ultimate, and True Emptiness,
Past, future, and present are as one.
The thirty-six heavens’ Heavenly Emperor Lords,
And the countless realms’ true immortals, like the sands of the Ganges.
Some dwell in the heavens, some among mortals,
Some seclude themselves in the mountains among the immortals.
Delivering the dead and saving the living without hindrance,
Responding to conditions with unfathomable subtlety.
In other realms and this world, ever heeding the call,
Across the nine lands and three paths, ever rescuing from suffering.
Concealed or revealed, transformations beyond measure,
Unknown to immortals, mortals, buddhas, or sages.
With compassion manifesting forms as models,
Countless sentient beings are all delivered.
Lifting from decay to rebirth through boundless kalpas,
Dispelling disasters and averting misfortunes beyond comprehension.
Radiant light pervades the Dharma assembly,
The six destinies and nine netherworlds all attain liberation.
Auspicious qi swirls, borne upon a jeweled chariot,
Propitious light shines brilliantly, descending upon the jade altar.
Now I bow in reverence and pay homage to the Peak Deity,
Whose blessings extend through the three realms and ten directions.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy having spoken this verse, all present bowed their heads in devotion, prostrating and paying homage to:

The Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Primordial Sage Emperor of the Eastern Peak,
The Four Peaks’ Four Heavenly Sage Emperors and the Civil and Martial Lords of Mount Tai,
The Virtuous and Illustrious Empress of Earthly Virtue of the Eastern Peak’s Main Palace,
The Life-Commanding and State-Protecting True Lord, Minister of the Eastern Peak,
The Radiant and Benevolent Prince of the Eastern Peak’s Upper Palace,
The Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden of Azure Clouds of Mount Tai,
The Deities in Charge of Bestowing and Measuring Blessings of the Eastern Peak,
The Holy Mother of the Eastern Peak, Guardian of Offspring, Childbirth, and the Womb,
The Loyal and Protective, Revered and Benevolent Deity of Jiangdong,
The Marshal and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Peak’s Court,
The seventy-five officials of the Underworld Court and the attending officials.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Heavenly Emperors and Perfected Ones, saying: “Since all beings have earnestly taken refuge and repented their transgressions with utmost sincerity, all sentient beings shall equally partake in these blessings.” Thereupon, the Four Perfected Ones, having received this revelation, offered this hymn of praise:

The Azure Emperor, Lord of the Five Peaks,
Nurtures and fosters all living beings.
Governing seventy-two domains,
All things rely on him for life and growth.
As Lord of the Middle Realm,
He commands the host of immortals and perfected ones.
Able to dissolve all sins,
Both the living and the dead share in his grace.

After this hymn was presented, only misty Dharma clouds were seen, ascending back to the cinnabar heavens. All the heavenly immortals, filled with joy and exultation, bowed their heads in reverence and withdrew, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.

Here ends the *Mysterious Model Scripture of the Eastern Peak’s Transformations: Delivering the Living, Saving the Dead, Removing Sins, Resolving Grievances, and Protecting Life*.
