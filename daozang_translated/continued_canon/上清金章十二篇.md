**The Twelve Golden Hymns of Supreme Purity**

Gazing in repose at the Palace of Great Radiance,
Golden towers gleam in the Purple Clarity.
The immortal chambers feast on Primordial Simplicity,
Four casements all of crimson jasper.

Tossing wheels across the Void Crossing,
Reining reins to dance the Green Chariot.
Jade blossoms fly as cloud-canopies,
The Western Consort unfurls her brocade banner.

Beyond the dust and filth, in a flash,
She arrives at the court of the radiant maiden.
Long-awaited resonance calls her forth,
Her attainment already hidden in the unseen.

Riding the wind toward the Nine Empyreans,
Together they revel in the peace of cinnabar splendor.
Turning to renounce the things of the world,
How could they know the numinous within the void?

Northward they ascend the Gate of Dark Mystery,
Hand in hand traversing the Lofty Web.
Incense smoke scatters across the Eight Sceneries,
The Dark Wind stirs the crimson waves.

Looking up, they transcend the Luminous Crossing,
Gazing down upon the winding valleys.
Singing and chanting above the clouds,
Phoenixes cry amidst the ninefold rosy mists.

Riding qi, they float through the Great Void—
Why tread the mountain slopes?
With golden tablets, they summon the feathered spirits,
Their armies crushing the myriad demons.

Rinsing and drawing from the round morning glow,
Accumulating spring to nurture the infant’s teeth.
Amidst the clamor of competition,
They remain untroubled, at ease.

The northern mounds brim with rosy mists,
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.
Azure herbs fall in the Phoenix Grove,
Emerald [ ] adorns the rocky cliffs.

The numinous pavilion soars into the Great Void,
Jasper chambers mingle with the Supreme Radiance.
Clouds rise within the winding chambers,
Eight winds fly through the dark sands.

The nine-stringed zither plays the Emperor’s ramparts,
Dragons roar in harmonious measure.
Fanning the gales across the Five Peaks,
Wielding the tablets, they subdue the ten thousand [demons].

In a fleeting glance,
Suddenly, the eon has passed.
Alas, those born at dawn—
How could they know the span of ages?

The Cornered Radiance dwells in the [Forest] Palace,
Moving the spirit through the silent and profound.
The supreme vision illumines the Six Courts,
Great and small all attain carefree wandering.

Dragon pipes entwine the canopy of clouds,
Tiger roars startle the myriad branches.
The Three Simplicities unveil the lofty chart,
Cinnabar mists flourish in the morning sky.

Feathered banners cross the Numinous Ford,
Purple chariots soar with flowered plumes.
Reining reins beyond the Nine Heavens,
Looking up and down, they roam the boundless.

Dust and foam congeal into clamor and defilement,
The spirit perishes, qi withers away.
Why not seek the distant journey?
Eight thousand years are but a single morning.

At dawn, they ford the azure sea’s waves,
Flying wheels depart the green chambers.
Singing the ode to kindred companions,
They soar beyond the azure vastness.

Three pacts with the jade-sky guests,
Five covenants with the Eastern Florescence youths.
Feathered gales ascend the Emperor’s dawn,
Feasting in the Palace of Broad Cold.

Eight tones plucked in the empty center,
Purple phoenixes sing the numinous wind.
Crimson mists veil the bright radiance,
Eight sceneries fly through the Great Void.

Chewing the jasper springs,
Vast and luminous, they return to infancy.
Supreme joy unites the Five Spirits,
Ages accumulate like blades of grass.

Shedding the mundane—what difficulty?
Toil and sorrow drain the celestial harmony.

At dawn, they harness the morning’s brilliance,
Loosening reins from the Purple Clarity.
Floating clouds race through the Great Radiance,
Raising canopies in the Broad Cold’s court.

The exalted Perfected guard the Emperor’s chambers,
Palace ponds draw the Western Numinous.
Ten absolutes in the Five Void Caverns,
Flying mists coil around brocade screens.

Tigers fan the divine winds,
Purple clouds wheel the dragon chariots.
In an instant, they traverse the Eight Directions—
A single glance, and the eon has passed.

The flute echoes the Mystic Contestant—
Why not seek the Great Life?
The divine gardens bloom with hidden herbs,
The Kun Pool irrigates the fields of vision.

Looking up at the Jade Clarity’s gates,
Towering above the Crimson Ford.
Purple mists reflect the winding mats,
Five clouds gleam upon the Nine Profundities.

Eight winds rise in the distant realms,
Mysterious mists linger between the green casements.
The Three Origins dwell in the Western Palace,
The Eastern Florescence holds fair maidens.

The Northern Darkness sings the Seven Whistles,
The Luminous Consort chants the Southern Perfected.
Striking the chime, they harmonize with the Vermilion Pitch,
Jade tablets raise the six strings.

In perfect accord, they rest beyond fate,
Together ascending the Broad Phoenix’s peak.
United in purpose, they command the myriad demons,
Dwelling amidst the host of dark thousands.

How effortless their transcendence—
Thus they unlock boundless years.

Riding qi, they gaze upon the Void Crossing,
Harnessing the light, they rest in the Nine Heavens.
Vibrant plumes stir the vast radiance,
The dark canopy arises in the spaceless.

Eight mists swirl through the boundless wheels,
Their paths untethered, time unpermitted.
Striking the chime, the eight voids resound—
My steed, too, knows no ford.

Wielding the tablet, they enter the Eastern Florescence,
Feasting at dusk on the Dark Garden’s peak.
Girding sashes, they lead the Five Numinous,
Loosening pendants, they soar with the fair ones.

Mysterious resonance follows its course,
Floating freely, they too have their destiny.
Together they mount the soaring wings,
A single flap stirs billions.

Descending light drifts upon the dark radiance,
Purple chariots ride the clouds in procession.
Looking up within the Golden Gates,
Gazing down upon the Western Florescence City.

The Eastern Florescence unfurls the Five Lights,
Divine radiance illumines the Seven Numinous.
Veiled reflections of the Three Banks’ torches,
Flowing freely, they equal the dark and light.

Winds drum the Void Crossing’s halls,
Incense smoke scatters in the jade courts.
Hand in hand with the Weaving Maiden,
Twin sashes fall in brocade green.

Primal cycles entwine the feathered banners,
Flowered canopies follow the clouds’ tilt.
Feasting beyond the Nine Cycles,
Right and wrong no longer concern them.

Embracing the void within the Mud-Pellet,
Their celestial forms grow ever more youthful.
How much worse the defilements of the world—
Within, sorrow and desolation breed.

The Fusang’s emerald peaks,
Vermilion clouds bloom faintly bright.
The Wave Terrace rests in the empty heights,
Four vistas mirror the lofty clarity.

Flying light reins the purple wheels,
Three Simplicities guide the cinnabar chariots.
Reclining in the Supreme Emperor’s halls,
Towering in the Mother’s courts.

Washing feet in the azure rapids,
Holding covenants with jasper wine jars.
At dawn’s curve, riding the wind’s fan,
Lightly they descend in their descent.

Briefly visiting the earth’s mists,
Turning their chariots toward the Ford of the Fair Perfected.
Mysterious gatherings follow their own summons,
Wandering freely through the dark and profound.

Only then do they know the fortune of glory and disgrace,
Only then do they awaken to the sorrow of fleeting years.
The winding chamber may be pure and still—
Let the spirit await the sun’s completion.

Why debate the path ahead?
A hundred ailments arise from this.

The Celestial Court births golden blossoms,
Within, they manifest the yin’s perversity.
Jade Valleys mingle with the Dark Ministers,
Jasper qi intertwines in mutual support.

Heavenly Perfected stand in distant days,
Flying medicines spew forth numinous sands.
At dawn, they harness the celestial steeds,
Turning chariots toward the Dark Mystery’s home.

Immortal ones enter the chamber,
Thus extinguishing the hundred perversities.

The Dao takes fasting as its foremost practice,
Diligent cultivation ascends the Golden Gates.
Thus is the Great Dharma Bridge established,
Universally ferrying all beings across.

Repaying karmic debts of past lives,
The Dao-heart arises in transcendent clarity.
Six fasts honor the Empty Cavern,
Ten vigils move the gods to profound response.
The Five Elders inscribe immortal names,
Cloud chariots come forth in welcome.
The body soars to the Mystic Capital,
Seven generations all attain liberation.

The Twelve Scrolls of the Shangqing Golden Chapters conclude.
