**Biographies of Zhuangzi**
Zhuangzi was a native of Meng, named Zhou. He once served as the warden of the Meng lacquer garden and was a contemporary of King Hui of Liang and King Xuan of Qi. His learning was boundless, yet its essence ultimately returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, he composed a work of over one hundred thousand characters, most of which were parables. He wrote *The Old Fisherman*, *Robber Zhi*, and *The Cut-Open Satchel* to criticize the followers of Confucius and elucidate the techniques of Laozi. Works like *Fear of Entanglement*, *Vacuity*, and *Kangsangzi* are all empty words without factual basis, yet he was skilled in weaving phrases and separating expressions, pointing to matters and categorizing emotions. He used these to satirize the Confucians and Mohists, so that even the most learned scholars of his time could not extricate themselves. His words flowed freely and indulged his own inclinations, and thus even kings and nobles could not employ him.

King Wei of Chu, hearing of Zhuang Zhou’s worthiness, sent envoys with generous gifts to summon him, offering to appoint him as minister. Zhuang Zhou laughed and said to the Chu envoys: "A thousand gold pieces are a great profit; a ministerial post is a position of honor. Have you alone not seen the sacrificial ox at the suburban rites? Fed for several years, clad in embroidered robes, it is led into the great temple. At that moment, even if it wished to be a solitary piglet, how could it be possible? Go quickly, do not defile me. I would rather roam and play in the filth of the ditches, delighting myself, than be fettered by those who rule a state." He never served as an official throughout his life, thus fulfilling his own aspirations.

**Zhuangzi’s Discourses** by Ruan Ji

On the day of *Yidan* in the *Zhixu* year, at the time when the myriad things first stir, in the long night of late autumn, the Master wandered and soared, riding the wind. He went to follow the banks of the Red Waters and came to ascend the mound of Hidden Hall. He stood by the winding path of Qu Yuan, gazed upon the vast expanse of Yang Mang, and suddenly halted, abruptly resting. He did not know why he had come or why he now remained, feeling disconsolate and joyless, and thus returned with a melancholy air.

At midday, he sat by his hidden table and plucked the zither. Thereupon, the gentry and the curious gathered to hear of it. They deliberated together, composing phrases and aligning verses, seeking to resolve their long-standing doubts. They adjusted their mirrors, straightened their robes, and bit their lips in anticipation. First, they cited precedents and reckoned the years, then followed closely on each other’s heels, advancing in measured steps, their gazes fixed and intent. They set foot on the stairs, hastened forward with winged steps, and sat shoulder to shoulder, sleeves drawn back in reverence, hesitating like a grove of trees—none daring to speak first.

Then one among them, the boldest of the group, glared fiercely and declared with a loud voice: "I was born after the age of Yao and Shun, grew up among the descendants of Wen and Wu, roamed in the prosperity of Cheng and Kang, and flourished in the present era. I have recited the teachings of the Six Classics and practiced the traces of our Confucian school. I have worn coarse robes, donned soaring caps, draped long skirts, and raised my twin egret plumes for many a day—yet I have never heard the essentials of the supreme Dao, nor anything that sets it apart from this. Moreover, the great men praise it, and the humble follow it. I wish to hear the ultimate teaching to resolve my doubts."

The Master said: "What are the doubts you harbor?"

The guest replied: "The Way of Heaven values life; the Way of Earth values constancy. The sage cultivates these to establish his name. Fortune and misfortune have their divisions; right and wrong have their principles. One pursues profit and high position, detests death, and cherishes life. Thus, the world is at peace, and great achievements are accomplished. Yet Zhuang Zhou equates fortune and misfortune, unites life and death, regards Heaven and Earth as a single thing, and the myriad kinds as a single finger. Is this not perverse and deluded, losing constancy while believing himself to be truly right?"

Thereupon, the Master caressed his zither, sighed deeply, lowered his head and smiled faintly, then raised his eyes and glanced around. He exhaled his spirit and spoke of what he had seen: "Once, there was a man who wished to gaze upon the peaks of Lang Feng. He prepared his court robes and cap, rode his fine steed, and arrived at the foot of Kunlun—only to vanish and never return. Court robes and caps are the adornments of ordinary attire; fine steeds are but common mounts. They are not fit for soaring over the heights of Zeng Cheng or roaming the gardens of Xuan Pu. Moreover, the light of the Torch Dragon does not illuminate a single hall; the sun of Mount Zhong does not shine into a secluded chamber."

Now, I shall descend from these towering heights and not follow the current of idle chatter. In speaking of the path you have taken, how might one nearly [ ] and yet return?

Heaven and Earth arise from the spontaneous; the myriad things arise from Heaven and Earth. The spontaneous has no beyond, thus Heaven and Earth are named. Heaven and Earth have within, thus the myriad things are born. When there is no beyond, who can call it different? When there is within, who can call it distinct?

The Earth flows with its dryness; Heaven lifts with its dampness. The moon rises in the east and sets in the west; following one another, they part and then unite. Rising is called yang; descending is called yin. On Earth, it is called pattern; in Heaven, it is called design. Steaming is called rain; scattering is called wind. Blazing is called fire; congealing is called ice. Form is called stone; image is called star. Dawn is called morning; dusk is called darkness. Flowing is called river; swirling is called abyss. Level is called earth; piling is called mountain.

Male and female share the same position; mountains and marshes share the same qi. Thunder and wind do not oppose each other; water and fire do not repel one another. Heaven and Earth unite their virtue; sun and moon follow their light. When the spontaneous is one body, the myriad things lightly follow their constancy.

Entering is called hidden; emerging is called manifest. Qi waxes and wanes, transforming without harm. Thus, deep yin and thunder are not separate manifestations; Heaven and Earth, sun and moon are not distinct things. Therefore, it is said: "Viewed from what is different, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what is the same, the myriad things are one body."

Humans are born within Heaven and Earth, embodying the form of the spontaneous. The body is the essence of yin and yang’s qi; nature is the true nature of the Five Phases. Emotions are the wandering soul’s changing desires; spirit is what Heaven and Earth use to govern. Speaking of life, no thing is not long-lived; extending this to death, no thing is not short-lived. Viewed from the small, nothing is not small; seen from the great, nothing is not great. A child who dies young is long-lived; Peng Zu is short-lived. A hair’s tip is great; Mount Tai is small. Thus, life and death are one strand; right and wrong are one thread.

Spoken of separately, beard and eyebrows have different names. Discussed together, they are but one hair of the body. The words of the Six Classics are teachings of division; what Zhuang Zhou says are words of intent. Viewed from above, the ultimate reaches no beyond; examined in detail, things have their limits.

To cling to the number fifteen, to scrutinize the names of left and right—this is a one-sided doctrine. To follow the spontaneous and accord with Heaven and Earth is a discourse of vastness. All that ears and eyes crave, the application of names and distinctions, the offices that do not change their duties, the offerings made to one’s person—these are not for severing hands and feet or tearing the body asunder.

Yet later generations, fond of the strange, do not grasp the root and each claims, "I alone am right." Why wait for them to harm life and injure nature, to repay Yu’s enemies and sever limbs without feeling pain? The eye sees colors but does not await the ear’s hearing; the ear listens to sounds but does not wait for the heart’s thought. The heart rushes after desires without abiding in what nature finds peaceful. Thus, when illness and affliction sprout, life is not fulfilled; when calamity and chaos arise, the myriad things are destroyed.

The perfected person is serene in life and tranquil in death. Serene in life, emotions are not confused; tranquil in death, spirit does not depart. Thus, they can transform with yin and yang without alteration, follow the changes of Heaven and Earth without shifting. In life, they exhaust their years; in death, they follow what is fitting. Heart and qi are balanced and governed, neither consumed nor diminished.

Therefore, Guangchengzi dwelled on Mount Kongtong to enter the gate of the boundless. The Yellow Emperor ascended the heights of Kunlun and left behind the root of the Dark Pearl. Thus, those who conceal themselves find it easy to live, while those who abandon the root, though they may endure, do not truly abide.

If Ma Yi had not encountered Hai Ruo, he would not have considered himself small. If Cloud General had not questioned Hong Meng, he would not have known his own insignificance. From this, it is said: those who are self-satisfied do not shine; those who establish themselves do not stand. Those who guard what they have, have a basis. Those who hold to what they lack, lack attachment.

The moon wanes and then waxes; the sun rises and then sets. The *Xianchi* does not linger above Yang Valley but hangs in the west, about to enter. Thus, those who seek to attain lose; those who contend for brightness fail. Those without desire are self-sufficient; the empty and void receive fulfillment.

That mountains are still and valleys deep is the Dao of the spontaneous. To obtain this Dao and be upright is the substance of the noble person. Thus, those who devise cleverness and skill harm things; those who make right and wrong clear endanger themselves. Those who cultivate adornment to display purity are deluded in life; those who fear death and honor life lose their constancy.

Therefore, when the principle of the spontaneous is not obtained, Heaven and Earth are not at peace, and sun and moon vie in their courses. Morning and evening lose their times, and day and night have no division. People vie and chase after profit, moving errantly and recklessly. Father and son do not harmonize; ruler and minister are estranged.

Thus, those who speak repeatedly to seek trust are deficient in sincerity; those who restrain themselves for others practice an external benevolence. Those who steal the pheasant’s warp threads are sons who ruin their families; those who cut open their bellies and slice their flesh are ministers who disorder the state. Those who display brilliance and drape themselves in the essence of the vast are scholars of a benighted age; those who tread frost and dew and are covered in dust are greedy and covetous people. Those who purify themselves to blame the world and cultivate their persons to clarify their faults belong to the class of slanderers. Those who multiply assertions of right and wrong and turn their backs on substance to chase after ornament belong to the ranks of the deluded.

If one truly acts to flatter and please, seeking each other’s trust, and thus dons pearls and jade to rush into water and fire, this is the end of Jie and Zhou. To hold beans and gather ferns, to starve to death together—this is the extremity of Yan Yi.

Thus, when the path of fame and profit opens, the sincerity of loyalty and trust thins. When the words of right and wrong stand out, the purity of genuine feeling melts away.

Thus, the ultimate extremity of the supreme Dao is undifferentiated unity, all things as one body—there is no loss, no inquiry.

Fu Xi knotted cords, and Shen Nong taught plowing. Those who defied them perished; those who followed them lived. How then could they have known that greed and fault were punishments, or that integrity and purity were fame? The essence of utmost virtue lies in nothing beyond.

In perfect harmony and unshaken simplicity, without duality in its principle, serene and still, empty and vast, awaiting all—good and evil are not distinguished, right and wrong do not contend. Thus, the myriad things return to their source and attain their true nature.

After the rise of Confucians and Mohists, debates over "hard and white" arose, fortune and misfortune clung to things, and gain and loss weighed on the heart. Disciples gathered in factions, and arguments clashed. Once, the heroes of Qi and the scholars of the Three Jin states boldly distinguished these matters. All believed that a life of a hundred years was hard to attain, while the passing of days and months was inescapable. They adorned their carriages and horses, refined their robes, embellished their pearls and jade, decorated their walls, flattered their rulers in public, deceived their fathers and elder brothers in private, feigned talent and wit, and competed in cunning schemes. Families were ruined by clever sons, and states were destroyed by capable ministers. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but instead multiplied their entanglements in the俗世.

Therefore, trees in the mountains grow large and remain unharmed, or if they develop myriad hollows, they harmonize as one and suddenly cease. When the crow’s nest is gone, its substance is lost, and its ornament is defiled—yet life and death remain unchanged, and the tortoise is prized for divining fortune. Thus, the perfected person purifies their substance and obscures their ornament, unaltered by life and death, as if these had never existed.

Distinguishing words are the discourse of those who embrace the Dao. Refuting arguments are the beginnings of virtue’s ruin. The division of qi is an illness of the body. A divided heart is the calamity of the myriad things.

Thus, those who ride eastward with reins in hand travel in separation; those who dwell on success and failure sit and seek adversaries. Those who block passes and attack defiles are men of Zhao. Those who would move mountains and fill seas are men of Yan and Chu.

Zhuang Zhou, seeing the world as such, expounded the wonders of the Dao and virtue, the root of non-action. He used parables to broaden its reach and borrowed things to extend its meaning, merely to delight the heart of non-action and wander carefree through the age. How could he have sought to approach the gates of Xianyang or contend in debate at Jixia?

Those who skillfully engage others merely guide them, without opposition. Thus, when Gong Mengzi and Li Zi wore embroidered robes to visit, Mozi did not attack Zhongshan; when Zimou’s heart was in Wei Pass, Zhanzi did not resist. They followed the reason for their coming, employed what they brought, welcomed them with ease, and let them settle naturally. They opened their hearts and allowed them to express themselves freely.

Moreover, what is there to say of Zhuang Zhou’s book? Have you not yet heard the discourse on the Great Beginning or the profound words of remote antiquity? Simply do no harm to things, and form arises with life; things suffer no destruction, and the spirit becomes clear. Form and spirit rest within me, and the Dao and virtue are perfected. Loyalty and trust do not depart, and superiors and inferiors are at peace.

Now, this guest’s discourse aligns with ancient teachings, yet his intent differs—his heart guards its root, while his words flow without restraint. Thereupon, the two or three disciples, swayed like wind and waves, exchanged glances, their veins pulsing, then retreated in disarray, stumbling and losing their way, merely gazing after him, their ears perhaps stuffed with fluff.

Later, I also realized through this that his words lacked substance, and I lost my vigor, briefly ashamed in my decline and seclusion.

**Wang Anshi’s Treatise on Zhuangzi**

Those who discuss Zhuangzi are not of one mind. Scholars of Confucianism say: Zhuangzi’s book is devoted to slandering Confucius to validate his heterodox teachings. It should be burned, and his followers suppressed—only then will it suffice. The right and wrong of such claims are not worth debating.

Those who speak thus as Confucians, and those who favor Zhuangzi’s Dao, say: Zhuangzi’s virtue did not allow the myriad things to disturb his thoughts, and he was able to trust his Dao. He was not ignorant of benevolence and righteousness but deemed them too small to practice. He was not ignorant of ritual and music but deemed them too shallow to transform the world.

Thus, Laozi said: When the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, benevolence follows; when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows; when righteousness is lost, ritual follows. This shows that Zhuangzi was not ignorant of the meaning of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—he regarded them as the dregs of the Dao and thus belittled them.

The words of Confucians are fine, yet they have never sought Zhuangzi’s intent. Those who favor Zhuangzi’s words certainly know how to read his book, yet they too have never truly sought his intent.

By Zhuangzi’s time, the grace of the former kings had been exhausted. The customs of the world were steeped in deceit and cunning, and simplicity and honesty had scattered. Even the scholars and great officials of the age did not know the way of valuing oneself and despising things. Thus, they cast aside the threads of ritual and righteousness, seized and struggled amid profit and harm! They pursued gain without shame, harmed themselves without resentment, and sank into corruption until they were beyond saving.

Zhuangzi lamented this and devised his teachings to correct the world’s ills and return it to uprightness. His heart was overly concerned, for he believed that benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music were insufficient to rectify the world. Thus, he equalized right and wrong, equated chaos and order, and unified profit and harm, deeming contentment of the heart as attainment. This was his way of correcting the world’s ills.

Having used his teachings to correct the ills, he then feared that later generations would treasure his words and fail to perceive the purity of heaven and earth or the great essence of the ancients. Thus, he lamented in the final chapter to absolve himself. Therefore, his book states: *The Odes* convey the will, *The Documents* convey affairs, *The Rites* convey conduct, *The Music* conveys harmony, *The Changes* convey yin and yang, and *The Spring and Autumn Annals* convey names and duties.

Viewed in this light, how could Zhuangzi have been ignorant of the sagely Way? He also stated: Just as the ear, eye, nose, and mouth each have their functions yet cannot substitute for one another, so too do the various schools of thought and myriad arts each possess their strengths and find their uses at different times. By this, he sought to clarify that the sagely Way in its entirety lies beyond, not within, his own teachings—yet he still placed his book alongside those of Song Jian, Shen Dao, Mo Di, and Lao Dan, all of whom he deemed partial and narrow, one-sided scholars. His intent was merely to show that his words were composed for a purpose, not to encompass the fullness of the great Dao.

Yet does this not mean that Zhuangzi harbored a deliberate concern for the world’s ills and sought to preserve the sagely Way? Boyi’s purity and Liuxia Hui’s harmony both served to correct the world’s flaws. Zhuangzi, in applying his mind, was likewise a follower of the sages. However, Zhuangzi’s words were inevitably branded as heterodox because his corrections went too far. When one seeks to straighten what is crooked, overcorrection leads back to crookedness. Zhuangzi himself said: Mozi’s intentions were right, but his conduct was wrong. If we extend Zhuangzi’s intentions to examine his conduct, how then does he differ from Mozi?

Later readers of Zhuangzi who appreciate the spirit behind his work rather than clinging to its specific doctrines may be said to read him well. This, too, was Zhuangzi’s hope for those who would read his book in future ages. Yet today’s readers wield Zhuangzi as a shield for their own Confucianism, declaring: "How vast is Zhuangzi’s Dao! It surpasses what the Confucians can ever comprehend." They fail to seek his underlying intent and instead prize only what differs from Confucianism—how lamentable!

Zhuangzi’s *Discourse on Inferior Scholars* criticizes the Zhou dynasty, rejecting Yao, Shun, and Confucius. Yet upon examining his work, one sees that his words are merely allegorical. Mencius said: "In interpreting the *Odes*, one must not let the text obstruct the phrase, nor the phrase obstruct the intent. By using one’s own intent to meet the poet’s intent, one grasps its meaning." Those who read Zhuangzi’s words without tracing them to their underlying intent are the very ones who dispute his claims.

Zhuangzi stated: "Those above must practice non-action to employ the world; those below must take action to be employed by the world." He also claimed to dwell amid benighted rulers and chaotic ministers, thus impoverished and unable to display his talents. Yet who would assert that Zhuangzi’s words cannot be applied to the relationships between ruler and minister, father and son, or that he was fated to live in an age where no ruler could be moved to action? When he cited the sacrificial ox of the grand ancestral temple to decline the Chu envoy’s invitation, he was merely using stark language to startle the mediocrities of a decadent age. With Zhuangzi’s talent, how could he have been confused about the proper course of action or retreat, or truly feared the ox?

He was likely the very sort of man Confucius described as "dwelling in seclusion and speaking freely." Yet since Zhuangzi’s teachings ultimately ran counter to the Dao, it is no wonder he offended the followers of the sages. For matters within the grasp of ordinary people, the sages explained in detail and practiced with care. If their explanations were insufficient or their practice careless, the world would fall into disorder. For matters beyond the reach of ordinary people, the sages concealed them in their hearts and spoke of them only briefly. Had they spoken at length, the world would have been confused. Moreover, those who must be instructed repeatedly before they understand, or persuaded endlessly before they submit—how could they be the ones with whom one discusses the highest truths?

Alas, Zhuangzi was eloquent but failed to grasp this principle.

*Zhuangzi’s Ancestral Hall*
Su Shi

Zhuangzi was a native of Meng. He once served as the keeper of the lacquer garden in Meng. Though he has been gone for over a thousand years, Meng had never established a shrine in his honor. The county magistrate and secretarial court gentleman Wang Ji first built an ancestral hall and sought an inscription to commemorate it.

Examining the *Records of the Grand Historian*, Zhuangzi was a contemporary of King Hui of Liang and King Xuan of Qi. His learning knew no bounds, yet its essence ultimately returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, the over one hundred thousand characters he wrote were largely parables. In works such as *The Old Fisherman*, *Robber Zhi*, and *The Full Understanding of Life*, he vilified Confucius’ disciples to defend Laozi’s teachings—this reveals only a superficial understanding of Zhuangzi. I believe Zhuangzi was, in fact, a supporter of Confucius, though his methods cannot be taken as a model.

When the Prince of Chu fled in disguise and the gatekeeper barred his way, his servant twisted a switch and cursed: "Slave! Why not drive the gatekeeper out?" Some matters are indeed perverse and contrary, yet if one deems the servant’s lack of devotion to the prince unacceptable, then the prince’s own principles are also flawed. Thus, Zhuangzi’s words often grant substance in form but withhold it in spirit; he outwardly repels while covertly aiding. His direct statements are few, and even when he vilifies Confucius, his true intent is subtly revealed. In his discussion of the world’s Daoist arts, he treats figures from Mozi, Zhuangzi, Qín Gùlí, Péng Méng, Shèn Dào, Tián Pián, Guān Yǐn, and Lǎo Dān down to himself as one school, excluding Confucius—his reverence for Confucius is thus extreme.

Yet I have long doubted the authenticity of *Robber Zhi* and *The Old Fisherman*, which seem to genuinely disparage Confucius, while *Yielding the Throne* and *Discoursing on the Sword* are shallow and far from the Dao. Reexamining them, I find the conclusion of his parables in the passage: "Yang Ziju traveled west to Qin and met Laozi. Laozi said, 'Why so haughty, so puffed up? Who would wish to dwell with you?' Great purity appears tainted; abundant virtue seems insufficient." Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly. When he had first departed, the innkeeper’s family had vied to welcome him—the master laid out the mat, the wife offered the towel, the grooms stood aside, and the cooks avoided the hearth. Upon his return, the innkeeper’s household now contested his seat.

Removing the four chapters—*Yielding the Throne*, *Discoursing on the Sword*, *The Old Fisherman*, and *Robber Zhi*—and aligning them with *Lie Yukou*, we find: "Lie Yukou journeyed to Qi but turned back midway, saying, 'I am astonished! I dined at ten millet-sellers’ stalls, and five offered me food first.'" Only then did he awaken and laugh, realizing it was all one lesson. Zhuangzi’s words were not yet complete when the ignorant appropriated and distorted them. I cannot but clarify this: the division into chapters and naming of sections all stem from世俗俗 conventions, not Zhuangzi’s original intent.

Recorded on the nineteenth day of the eleventh month, the first year of the Yuanfeng era.

*Parting Gift to Pan You*
Zhuangzi said: "Gain is a matter of timing; loss is a matter of compliance. Abiding in timing and complying with fate, not even joy can enter." You often cherished these words.

What is called "gain" is like a person’s life—from one year to two, extending to a hundred, from youth to maturity, from maturity to old age. The passage of years cannot be refused. Is this not gain through timing? Loss, too, is like the years from one to a hundred: dusk loses dawn, today loses yesterday, maturity loses youth, old age loses maturity. The departure of years cannot be detained. Is this not loss through compliance?

All things under heaven are thus: arrival cannot be avoided, departure cannot be detained. Therefore, abiding in timing and complying with fate, not even joy can enter. The enlightened know that I cannot control things, nor can things control me—both remain untouched. Thus, they drift freely, vast and unconstrained, in accordance with nature. Unaware of why it is so, yet it is so. Thus, they view the affairs of the world as a speeding chariot passing an anthill—encountering it is not gain, leaving it is not loss. How can one distinguish gain and loss in between or entangle sorrow and joy in their convergence?

Consider a person’s life from one year to a hundred: amid gain and loss, sorrow and joy, all is tangled and burdensome. In the moment, sorrow brings unshakable grief, joy brings unalterable delight. Yet when it passes and one reflects, it all seems like a dream. Then the former delight and grief—how delusory they were! Thus, the future’s view of the present will be like the present’s view of the past. Why should today’s losses trouble the past?

To the south of Yan and the north of Yue, where the sun and moon arise—this is called the Central Kingdom. Where the sun and moon rise in the east and set in the west—this is called day and night. Among them, those who have teeth, bear hair, eat grains, and wear clothing—these are called humans. The stirring of a single nature—this is called the Great Change, meaning that nature shifts and remains unfixed. Sometimes it becomes human, sometimes it becomes other kinds, depending only on what nature favors. The ceaseless transformations of hardness and softness, movement and stillness—these are called things. Their calling to one another with sounds—this is called naming. Their gathering through mutual attraction—this is called profit. And so on and so forth—these are called affairs, which are stored in the heart. Sometimes they become joy, sometimes sorrow, sometimes resentment; though their names are many, they are all transformations of a single heart. In the beginning, there was nothing—what could there be in the end? Thus, self and other are divided. The other calls me "other," and I call the other "other." The other calls itself "I," and I likewise call myself "I." If we point at one another, all are "other"; if we point at ourselves, all are "I." Yet in the end, who is the other, and who is the self? Even the sage cannot determine this. And so, they forcibly impose order upon it.

Thus, some name them Shang and Zhou, others Qin and Han. The skin of bamboo from the smelting valleys is stretched and cut—this is called *jian* and *jian*. Binding the tip of a brush, dipping it in cinnabar and ink, then letting it move freely—this is called *wen*. Gathering these myriad affairs and recording them—this is called the classics and records. Later generations regard them as "studying antiquity." Generation after generation imitates them without cease, some attaining the Dao, others drowning in the heart—this is called learning.

Some say: from ancient times to the present, all who bustle about within it share but a single stroke. Within that single stroke, they scheme for ten thousand generations—how is this different? It is like waking and worrying over dreams, dreaming and worrying over waking. The sun, moon, and stars, the hills, mountains, and marshes remain as they were. Those with teeth and hair, the hard and soft, the moving and still—all continue endlessly. As for the so-called Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Han, some contended and gained them, others contended and lost them—what remains of them now? When I regard them now, it is as waking regards dreams. How could it compare to embodying the Dao, settling one’s nature, and taking clarity and emptiness as one’s task?

The affairs of the world, before they arrive, have no form. In the present, they do not abide; once past, they are nothing. What then do I seek in my bustling? Yet those who covet desire and love profit, whose hearts are struck by gain and loss, are as cramped as colts beneath a yoke—how could they be unbound? If one could speak like Liezi or utter words like Zhuang Zhou—like thunder pouring into the ears, like wind scorching the world’s yokes, releasing the world’s colts—would they not return vast and empty to the realm of nothingness, even to the point of no words?

What I have said before is thus. As for your conduct, I record this to send you off—those who are most cramped suffer from a diseased heart. May my words cure their affliction.

**Miscellaneous Sayings**
By Wang Pang

The sage has discourse but no debate; the various masters have debate but no discourse. Discourse is speaking and then stopping; discussion is evaluating and then stopping; debate is disputing the right and wrong of affairs. Beyond the six directions, the sage leaves it unspoken. Within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not dispute—this is the sage’s discourse. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* governs the near at hand, and that is all—this is the sage’s discussion. The sage’s discussion is not by choice; how could it be like the common people, who strive to debate to display themselves?

In Zhuangzi’s book, the dialogue between the shadow and the indistinct asks: does the shadow of a shadow depend on form? It seems to depend on form, yet in truth, it does not. The "and yet not" refers to those who take rising, sitting, bowing, and lifting as dependent on form—how would they know that the shadow does not truly depend on form? To say the shadow must depend on form, and form must depend on the Creator, is to fail to merge with spontaneous transformation. One who merges with spontaneous transformation knows that the shadow does not depend on form, nor form on the Creator—it culminates in nothingness. Thus it is said: how could one know why it is so or not so?

Zhuangzi, in his self-contentment, spoke of dreaming as a butterfly; in his self-joy, he spoke of the joy of fish. The butterfly, small and fluttering, goes everywhere without hindrance; the fish, dwelling in the deep and vast, preserves its life. Thus he lodged his meaning of self-contentment and self-preservation in a single thing, as in the *Qi Xie*’s myriad things.

*Zhi yan* are words that are not uniform. When words are not uniform, they move and proliferate endlessly. Thus it is said: daily words are not uniform, yet their emergence must have a root. Thus it is said: harmonizing with the heavenly boundary. The heavenly boundary is the wondrous root of spontaneity. When words have their root, they respond to change without limit. Thus it is said: following to extend infinitely. When words respond to change without limit, the years of past and present may come to an end, but my words have no end. Thus it is said: to exhaust the years. Though Zhuang Zhou’s words are unconstrained and varied, they never depart from the root of the Dao. Thus Guo Xiang called Zhou one who knew the root—this is what it means to understand Zhuangzi deeply.

What the myriad things follow is the Dao. The Dao is what things follow, yet it is not confined to them. Thus, in its greatness, it never exceeds anything, and in its subtlety, it never omits anything. Therefore, the talents and natures of the myriad things each have their proper measure, and each takes what is fitting. This is why Zhuang Zhou’s book speaks of the *kun* and *peng*, the cicada and the fledgling dove, the sparrow and the wren, the ant, the sheep, the butterfly, the horse, the ox, the mountain, and the tree.

The root of the Dao lies before the Supreme Ultimate yet is not high; it lies beneath the six poles yet is not deep. Before heaven and earth existed, it was not ancient; from of old it has endured, older than high antiquity yet not long-lived. The ten thousand existences differ—this is called abundance. Unifying their differences—this is called great abundance. Having this is called great enterprise. This is the sage.

Only after there is form is there name; only after there is name is there distinction; only after there is distinction is there preservation. Zhuangzi said: once form and name are clear, preservation follows. Zhuangzi’s meaning in "not breaking the *moye* sword, not resenting the flying tile," and "not angered by the empty boat" is the same.

Heaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons have bright patterns yet do not discuss; the myriad things have completed principles yet do not explain. Thus Confucius wished to be without words, saying: "What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born." Who but one who embodies the Dao could attain this?

Following one’s nature is spontaneity. Cultivating the Dao is making it so. Spontaneity is Heaven. Making it so is man. Within spontaneity, there is being. Beyond making it so, there is nothing.

How can man take away what one already possesses or add what one inherently lacks? Thus, what one possesses is one’s nature; what one lacks is what Zhuangzi calls excess. Virtue is what one already possesses. To add to what one already possesses is excess. Hence it is said: "Webbed toes and extra fingers arise from nature yet are excessive in virtue; growths and tumors emerge from form yet are excessive in nature."

The gentleman’s path has its limits and passages; the sage’s Way knows no dullness or sharpness. What the people perceive is merely what is so. The gentleman’s boundaries have limits and passages, yet his heart knows no difference between them. Thus it is said: "Whether in adversity or prosperity, one finds joy—for adversity and prosperity are but the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain."

Zhuangzi said: "Do not let the artificial destroy the Mandate." The human Dao is called the artificial; the Heavenly Dao is called the Mandate. The Dao is like the year; the sage is like the seasons. When Zhuang Zhou composed *Autumn Floods* and spoke of "the time having come," he meant acting only when the time is right. Yet how can narrow-minded scholars, pointing to this, find fault? No wonder he raged that one might as well argue with summer insects about ice or with well-frogs about the sea.

Zhuangzi said: "Yan Hui has forgotten benevolence and righteousness, yet has not yet forgotten ritual and music." Benevolence and righteousness are forgotten first, ritual and music later—does this mean benevolence and righteousness are inferior to ritual and music? Here Zhuangzi first speaks of forgetting the inner, then the outer: benevolence and righteousness are inner; ritual and music are outer. Only when both inner and outer are forgotten can one attain "sitting in forgetfulness." This is why his words differ.

The sage treats the necessary as unnecessary; the common people treat the unnecessary as necessary. What does this mean? The noble person speaks without insisting on trustworthiness, acts without insisting on results—this is treating the necessary as unnecessary. To insist on trustworthiness in speech and results in action is to treat the unnecessary as necessary.

Zhuangzi’s words sometimes resemble those of sages and worthies; they cannot be entirely dismissed. The sage does not impose his will, yet his will endures; does not assert his self, yet his self remains. He moves only when pressed, rises only when unavoidable—not acting by will, not rising by self, but merely responding.

Zhuangzi asked: "Does the one who masters things not become mastered by things?" Xunzi, who was well-versed in the Dao, would agree with this "mastering things." Stillness is the root; movement is the branch. The sage remains constant with things in stillness and responds to them in movement. The common people separate from things in stillness and contend with them in movement. The sage masters things; the common people are mastered by things—nothing more.

Confucius said: "The gentleman studies to attain the Dao." Zhuang Zhou said: "The Dao cannot be attained." Confucius said: "As virtue, the *Doctrine of the Mean* is supreme." Zhuangzi said: "Virtue cannot be reached." Why? It is said: Confucius speaks of what lies in man; Zhuang Zhou speaks of what lies in Heaven. If it lies in Heaven, how can the natural Dao be attained? How can one obtain it of oneself? If virtue cannot be reached, how can one obtain virtue? Only when one can attain can one cease attaining; only when one can reach can one cease reaching.

Zhuangzi’s book explores the mysteries of nature and life, unifies the scattered threads of Dao and virtue, aiming to dispel confusion and replace it with clarity. This is the teaching of returning to the root and recovering the Mandate, the words that shatter the measuring cups and break the scales—from which such ideas arise.

Yet when the Dao resides in the heart and converges in the mind, inquiry into the Dao meets no response—what need is there for words? For while non-speech suffices to exhaust the subtleties of the Dao, silence alone cannot clarify the necessity that gives rise to words. Only when pressed does one respond, only when moved does one act. Thus, he harnesses his discourse and carries it forward, allowing learners to grasp the meaning and forget the image, grasp the image and forget the words. This, too, is Zhuang Zhou’s hope for the world.

Zhuangzi spoke of the marsh pheasant in a cage, lamenting its loss of true nature. The perfected person of old could forget his cunning mind, still his external concerns, align his heart with the great void, harmonize the Dao with yin and yang, regard heaven and earth as a single morning, and distant ages as a single storehouse. To him, no person was strange, so things could neither draw near nor grow distant. Thus he transcended all boundaries—unlike the marsh pheasant trapped in its cage.

Zhuangzi said: "The true person of old made mistakes without regret, acted rightly without self-satisfaction." Thus the sage is not without faults. To err without self-reproach is to be as Heaven. If one were like others, one would correct faults without reluctance—and all would look up to him.

When winter is warm and summer cold, these are Heaven and Earth’s faults. If even Heaven and Earth have faults, how can the sage be without them? Great fear is called dread; small fear is called anxiety. Zhuangzi said: "Great fear is boundless; small fear is restless."

Zhuangzi’s book penetrates the distinction between nature and life without being moved by life and death, fortune and misfortune. In this, it approaches the sage—yet only the enlightened can attain such clarity. Reading the words of sages can also lead one here. Those who fail to reach this and instead sink into Zhuangzi’s teachings cause great disorder.

When the qi of the night remains, the myriad thoughts are stilled. If it does not remain settled, one cannot attain morning clarity. Attaining morning clarity is what is meant by returning to the root of virtue. The spirit surpasses the sage, for it is the spirit that animates the myriad things. The sage shares the sorrows of the myriad things. Without spirit, the sage cannot act; without action, the sage cannot withdraw.

Zhuang Zhou’s words exalt the spirit and deprecate the sage—this is an overcorrection of excess. Zhuangzi said, "From its own root, from its own origin." The root (*ben*) is the "one" beneath the tree (*mu*). The origin (*gen*) is the tree (*mu*) resting beside the *gen* trigram. The root emerges from the origin, yet the origin clings to the root. They depend upon each other to give life. Thus, the root is destiny (*ming*), and the origin is nature (*xing*). Laozi said: "Returning to the root is called stillness"—this speaks of nature. "Stillness is called the restoration of destiny"—this speaks of the root.

In Zhuangzi’s book, there are references to "true persons" and "perfected persons." The "true" refers to their nature, while the "perfected" refers to the utmost of the human Dao. Clarity (*ming*) is the dispersion of spirit; spirit is the storehouse of clarity. Thus, clarity arises from spirit. Hence it is said: clarity does not surpass spirit. Laozi said: "The gate of heaven opens and closes." Zhuangzi said: "The gate of heaven is nothingness"—for the myriad things emerge from it, thus it is called "opening and closing." For the myriad things are stored within it, thus it is called "nothingness."

Zhuangzi’s term *xingming* refers to the boundless expanse that is itself boundless. The myriad things flourish and take form within it—this is what is meant by "not seeing its limit." The myriad things are complete within heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth have no intention toward them. Thus it is said: "Great completeness!" Nothing compares to heaven and earth—yet what do they seek? And in their great completeness, the myriad things are also complete within my own body, for I do not externally labor for things. Thus it is said: "One who knows great completeness seeks nothing." In this way, one attains spontaneity and does not stray from the Dao. How could one abandon the self to pursue things? Hence it is said: "Lose nothing, discard nothing, do not exchange the self for things."

Zhuangzi also spoke of "having name and having reality"—these are the dwellings of things. This means: in substance, it is substance; in function, it is function—thus the myriad things arise from them. "Having no name and no reality" refers to the emptiness within things. This means: though unseen and unheard, it must gather in emptiness. What can be spoken or conceived grows ever more distant; what is wordless and thoughtless is how the Dao draws near.

Zhuangzi’s book embodies the subtlety of the Dao. Its words aim to salvage the primal state before nature and destiny disperse, awakening the world from its vulgar customs. How could this not be rooted in the Dao? The Dao is the sea; the sage is the hundred rivers. The Dao is the year; the sage is the seasons. Though the hundred rivers differ, what they share is the sea. Though the four seasons differ, what they share is the year. Though the paths of Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, and Zhuangzi suit different times, in essence, where do they depart from this? To read Zhuangzi’s book, seeking its meaning and recording its words—this may be called skillful reading.

**Nine Discourses on Zhuangzi**
*By Li Shibiao Yuanzhuo*

**Dreaming of the Butterfly’s Root**
The myriad things share a single root; right and wrong are of one qi. What is it that makes Zhou Zhou, and what is it that makes the butterfly? To take Zhou as real and the butterfly as false is to fail to forget the self. To take the butterfly as real and Zhou as false is to fail to forget things. The opposition of self and things spawns a thousand tangled forms—yet to say they are unequal is merely delusion, for one does not know things. From the absence of things, even the butterfly is not the self; from the absence of self, even Zhou is an illusion. How can there be a division between corpse and form?

Fluttering in a dream as a butterfly, the butterfly is Zhou. Awakening serene as Zhou, Zhou is without butterfly. This is the vision of the solitary, the equality of things. To regard one’s body as private and cling to the myriad things, grasping them by form when awake and taking them as real, engaging with them in spirit when asleep and taking them as dreams—this is to not know that a single night’s waking and dreaming are the opening and closing of one form. The opening and closing of one form is the coming and going of one nature. Transforming into a thing, one grieves; returning to being human, one rejoices. Yet what is there to grieve in things, or to rejoice in being human? This is merely one of the ten thousand transformations that have no beginning or end. To secretly cherish one’s form is delusion.

Only after great awakening does one know the great dream; only after the true person does one attain true knowledge. The dreamer does not know waking, so does not take the dream as false. The wakeful do not know dreaming, so do not take waking as real. Zhou does not know the butterfly, so does not take the butterfly as false. The butterfly does not know Zhou, so does not take Zhou as true. Thus, in all that one encounters, past knowledge shifts and transformations arise, following circumstances without choice—yet the mind has never had knowledge of this.

Therefore, this chapter establishes Ziqian’s mourning for the self to open the theme of equalizing things, and lodges Zhuang Zhou’s dream of the butterfly to complete the meaning of equalizing things. Alas! The whole world is asleep—all under heaven is one dream. The oak tree of the altar told men through a dream; the turtle of the Yuan Lord sought escape through a dream; the servant of the Yin family found joy in a dream; the man of Zheng who caught a deer sued over it in a dream; Huaxu wandered the emperor’s realm in a dream. Those who dream reach their destinations and find peace in what they encounter, knowing it is illusion and not real. Why should this case be any different?

Those who attain the Dao loosen their grasp to penetrate their attainment, still their minds to gather emptiness, cultivate sincerity to generate spirit, and settle into tranquility to return to illumination. They view the world’s gains and losses, right and wrong, nobility and baseness, success and failure, life and death as mere dreams and illusions. Why single out Zhou and the butterfly for doubt? The true persons of old did not dream in sleep and had no cares when awake. Through this teaching, I have come to know that Zhuangzi’s words are not mere allegory.

**Butchering the Ox**
This is the self-emptying of the thingless, covering the ten thousand transformations and ever unobstructed. Those who cling to things as real respond to one path and become mired. Things are originally without things—their essence is inherently free. The Dao is nowhere impassable—where is there need for butchering? Yet it is called "butchering the ox" because the mind departs from things and never sees the ox, riding emptiness and following principle without ever wielding the blade.

Is butchering the ox truly butchering at all? Consider the knife—nineteen years of use, traversing the reckoning of yin and yang, no brief span. Consider the butchering—thousands of oxen, meeting the world’s changes, no small tally. One might suspect the blade worn dull, yet its edge remains as if newly whetted. For those who cling to traces, every instant shifts; those who grasp the root abide unchanged through the ages. The wondrously serene essence moves yet does not waver; the luminously empty function enters the dust yet remains unstained.

Is not the body itself an illusion—what knife could truly wield it? Are not the ten thousand things mere delusions—what ox could truly be butchered? The knife exists that it may endure; the ox exists that it may be established. When self and things merge, the distinction between ability and object dissolves. One roams freely in the ancestor of the ten thousand things, where emptiness cannot be grasped. Thus, without ever striking, the great seams part of themselves; without ever guiding, the great cavities release of themselves; without ever contending, what is naturally so solidifies of itself; without ever acting, the technique and sinews align of themselves—like a great gourd, what need is there?

With this, the knife moves with a resonant *huo* yet bears no labor of responding to things. The blade’s motion is subtle, without the mind of competing with things. Releasing the knife, one faces the world without the burden of lingering things. Lifting the knife, one stands without the pursuit of fleeting things. When its use is complete, one carefully sheathes it, returning it to non-use. This is why the knife is never harmed.

Yet the supreme Dao is nowhere yet everywhere; its wondrous function responds without responding. The hand responds to touch yet knows not the hand; the shoulder leans yet knows not the shoulder; the foot treads yet knows not the foot; the knee bends yet knows not the knee. Heaven’s mechanism unfolds, each unaware of itself; the great function makes no choice, yet all is naturally so. This is why the knife’s reach is vast, ever with room to spare.

Once the mind perceives the ox, the burden of butchering arises, and the principle of preserving life is already harmed. Thus, the skilled butcher replaces his knife yearly, for he cuts; the common butcher replaces his monthly, for he hacks. This knife is neither ancient nor modern—time cannot contain it; neither long nor short—measure cannot confine it; neither new nor old—transformation cannot alter it; neither thick nor thin—substance cannot define it. Its inherent hardness requires no forging to be firm; its serene function requires no tempering to be bright. Cook Ding wields it as effortlessly as earth scattered on the ground, while the common butcher finds every task arduous.

From the Dao’s perspective, in butchering there is no butchering—without the knife, butchering is unknowable. In attainment there is no attainment—without butchering, attainment cannot stand. Seeing the common butcher through Cook Ding’s eyes, one grasps his attainment. Seeing Cook Ding through the common butcher’s eyes, one grasps his butchering. When both butchering and attainment are relinquished, emptiness alone remains.

Tracing Zhuang Zhou’s intent, he employs the butcher to convey the essence of nurturing life, placing it alongside the equality of things and the freedom of wandering. Why do all things fail to harmonize? Those shackled by the burden of form cannot wander freely. Why do all things fail to equalize? Those bound by distinctions of great and small cannot see their unity. Thus, one meekly submits to things, grinding away in the mire of entanglement—how rarely life escapes unharmed!

Only one inwardly without self can wander in the realm of self-attainment. Only one outwardly without things can equalize things in the domain of supreme oneness. Such a one embodies the Dao and roams among the ten thousand things—what obstruction could there be? Thus, Zhuang Zhou introduces the parable of butchering the ox, and Lord Wenhui through it attains the way of nurturing life.

**Hiding the Boat**
Viewed from the nothingness of things, the true and constant abides in serene stillness, ancient yet never departing. Viewed from the existence of things, the great transformation swiftly passes like an arm’s turn. Those who fail to grasp this, even amid the flux of phenomena, lose sight of the unchanging source.

Thus, floating dust may merge with the great void; an autumn hair may encompass heaven and earth. Entrusting the ten thousand transformations to the unchanging, one might carry them away—where could they be placed? Those who remain ignorant, gazing upon life’s finite span, entrust themselves to the realm of inevitable encounters. Yet the flame that stops is not the flame that continues; the form that compares is not the former self. Though one might grasp and hold fast, all slips away in the obscurity of time. This is why Zhuang Zhou offers the parable of hiding the boat in the ravine and marsh.

The ravine and marsh, in their luminous emptiness, embody the creator’s mindlessness. The boat and mountain, in their movement and stillness, embody the corporeality of form. The Dao is one alone. The one is inherently without direction—yet the ravine and marsh have direction. The one is inherently without form—yet the boat and mountain have form. When the one follows movement and stillness, roaming in the realm of direction, or when it is obscured by luminous emptiness, confined to the realm of form, then the one becomes dual.

Duality brings opposition: flourishing and decline, new and old, life and death. The one, being without two, moves alone and returns alone, without past or present. Duality brings pairing, thus things take shape, vie with one another, arise and perish in turn. Therefore, to hide fire with fire is one—hide it in water, and it is extinguished. To hide water with water is one—hide it in earth, and it is buried.

Moreover, the boat and mountain have form; the ravine and marsh have direction. To grasp and hide them is to act with intention—yet the creator, who has never begun to have things, can at midnight carry them away. Nevertheless, only one who is not a thing can give rise to things; only one who does not transform can bring about transformation. Swift as a gallop, fleeting as a breath, without pause—transformation is inherently impermanent.

I understand now: this is how the creator deludes the moving masses, imbuing the mindful with the illusion of existence and decay.

Where the mind abides, things abide; where the mind vanishes, things vanish. When you conceal them in ravine or marsh, what the mind perceives seems fixed and sure—yet this sliver of existence never truly stood, and in an instant it is lost. At midnight, what the mind perceives seems to have departed—yet this sliver never truly moved, for only one who holds to the great stillness can wander where things cannot pursue and all things endure. That place where things cannot pursue and all things endure is where the ten thousand things are bound, where the one transformation awaits.

The ancients who concealed the world within the world did so by this means. The world is where the ten thousand things are one, and man is but one among them. If one truly attains the wholeness of the One, then knowing that the transformations of the ten thousand things have no beginning or end, movement is never not oneself—thus transcending age and decay. Beginning and end become what one desires, with nothing to abhor. Compared to one who rejoices at merely assuming human form, can such joy be measured?

The ancients spoke of this: the ten thousand things are complete within me; turn inward and be sincere—no joy is greater. This joy, though the deluded use it all day, remains unknown to them. They dwell in it, pass through life with it, wander among things in the inn of transformation—how could they fathom Zhuang Zhou’s concealing of the world within the world and his discourse on it?

Sit in forgetfulness.
The mind is not yours—who, then, possesses it?

These are but accumulated habits given false names. The body is not yours—who, then, possesses it? It is but the harmonious union of a hundred bones, illusorily born. Realize that the mind is no-mind and the ten thousand things are all my mind—what need is there to suppress hearing and sight? Realize that the body is no-body and the myriad forms are all my body—what need is there to cast off limbs and senses? How much less, then, for benevolence and righteousness, or the trivialities of ritual and music? Thus, in movement and stillness, speech and silence, there is nothing that is not the wondrous; in freedom and constraint, reversal and compliance, there is nothing that is not the great wandering. Who would recognize this as forgetting?

Otherwise, weary of disturbance and drawn to quiescence, fearing existence and delighting in nothingness—if this is called forgetting, then clods of earth and heaps of dust could also be called forgetting. Yan Hui approached the sage yet did not fully transcend; his attainment surpassed the multitude yet remained incomplete. To follow the spontaneous emptiness of the single transformation is to be "without thing"—this is the sage. To be bound by external conditions and swept away with them is to be "with thing"—this is the multitude. One who is "without thing" finds nowhere that is not forgetting; one who is "with thing" finds no moment that can be forgetting. Is this not why Yan Hui practiced "sitting in forgetfulness"?

Turning back from the flowing realm of the ten thousand things, one darkly merges with the unchanging source of the single nature. In still contemplation of the world, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are all but empty names; in the luminous clarity of the numinous source, limbs and senses are all but illusory perceptions. Forget things and there are no things—empty names fall away of themselves; forget the self and there is no self—illusory perceptions vanish of themselves. Yet benevolence and righteousness do not name themselves; the deluded grasp them as names. Limbs and senses do not perceive themselves; the deluded recognize them as perceptions. Know that the body arises from nothingness, and the limbs will naturally wither—yet to insist on their withering is still to cling to the view of the body. Know that the mind arises from non-arising, and hearing and sight will naturally fade—yet to insist on their fading is still to cling to the view of the mind.

Moreover, if even limbs and senses are ultimately nonexistent, how could benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music truly exist? Formerly, one acted with virtue upon the liver and diaphragm, and all things were known; now, there is no knowing. Formerly, one toiled the mind between the brows and lashes, and all things were seen; now, there is no seeing. Is this not "sitting in forgetfulness"? Yet once it is called forgetting, Confucius would not tolerate questions, and Yan Hui would not tolerate responses. How could one know the benefit of even a single hair, or the harm of even a single hair? How could one know whether the forgetting of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music is incomplete, or whether the casting off of limbs and senses is complete?

From the wondrous perspective, the fallen forget their carts, the drowned forget water, people forget the Dao and its arts, fish forget rivers and lakes—this, too, is forgetting. From the coarse perspective, the successful forget their forms, the greedy forget truth, the enraged forget the ruts of carts, the grasping forget the crowd in the marketplace—this, too, is forgetting. Shall we deem one right and the other wrong? The Dao has no right or wrong. Shall we deem one true and the other false? The Dao has no true or false. Yan Hui turned his back on the dust and returned to the wondrous, diminishing the real to gather the empty—yet I know his forgetting was not yet complete forgetting. Were he to advance further in this Way, not-forgetting would also be forgetting. This is why Confucius, at sixty, transformed with each of his sixty years—what need was there to prize forgetting?

Master Hu’s spirit was the wondrousness of things, yet he never displayed wondrousness; the things that received his wondrousness never knew it—this is called "spirit." Those shamans, however, deceive with words of spirit, predicting life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise—though their verifications may be as precise as months or days, this is but semblance of wondrousness, not true wondrousness. To call them "spirit-shamans" and yet name one "Ji Xian" is to allude to the wondrousness of things and those who are moved by it.

Moreover, Xian was one who was moved and thus moved others. He used his own mind to move the minds of others, his own perceptions to see the perceptions of others. Thus, life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise—these empty names arose. Once names were empty, he falsely saw them; once seeing was false, he falsely spoke of them. The world, mired in appearances and unable to darkly merge with emptiness, falsely accepted them as real. Taking them as truth, Liezi fled in haste. Even Liezi, though he saw this, was intoxicated by it—for his heart had not yet been hollowed out. His learning had not yet been cut off, so others could still read his fortune.

Now, the Hu vessel takes emptiness and indestructibility as its essence, and profound clarity and unfathomability as its function. You, however, had the way of the "emergent mother" to respond to the world, thus you could lodge the formless within the formed. Ji Xian, having a mind, was moved by things, so with each encounter he claimed to see. Master Hu, having no mind, responded to things, so with each arrival he merely showed. He who is without mind treads form beyond the formless—how could Xian read his fortune? He transcends number before the unnumbered—how could Xian know him?

Ji Xian was still burdened by form and number, not yet free from perception. Where he saw, he took it as life and death—inescapable as this was. Thus, at first, Master Hu showed him the "earthly pattern," and Xian sighed at his death. Next, he showed him "heaven and earth," and Xian rejoiced at his life. He did not know that death is not truly death—when the mind is extinguished, there is death; life is not truly life—when the mind arises, there is life. The life and death of form are the arising and ceasing of the mind; the arising and ceasing of the mind are the presence and absence of perception.

The perfected person has never had a mind. At rest, they share virtue with yin; in movement, they ride the waves with yang. Sharing virtue with yin, Xian could not see him—so he showed the "earthly pattern," and pattern is where things become entangled. Riding the waves with yang, Xian could not see him—so he showed "heaven and earth," and earth is where things attain wholeness.

He showed him the Great Harmony, and Xian took it as unevenness. The "earthly pattern" is where yin overcomes yang; "heaven and earth" is where yang overcomes yin; the Great Harmony is the mean of yin and yang—where nothing overcomes, there is the equilibrium of heaven and earth. The ten thousand methods are one in essence, fundamentally without high or low, yet he saw them as uneven.

Yet all three are called "mechanisms." They are the subtle stirrings of movement, glimpsed before they manifest—thus he was able to perceive them. When shown that which has never departed from our origin, it is as if nothing were shown at all. He cast reality upon me, while I responded with emptiness; he received me as something, while I received him as nothing. His arising mind, enslaved to perception, saw only finitude; my departure from the human, concealing heaven, held infinity. To measure infinity with finitude—this was his undoing. Thus Ji Xian fled at the sight of him, vanishing when pursued.

Nevertheless, Master Hu told Liezi, "This is seeing my 'Virtue-Sealed Mechanism.'" He also said, "He nearly saw my 'Excellent Mechanism.'" Again, "This is seeing my 'Balanced Qi Mechanism.'" In each case, he spoke of "my"—still asserting a self. But when I emptied myself and flowed with him, who could know who was who? Even I lost myself—who then was the one showing? Who was the one perceiving? Thus he fled.

Master Hu’s mind was the Great Void. The essence of the Great Void is luminous, wondrous, and profound, embracing the ten thousand existences. Adorn it with splendor, yet it does not linger; strike it with blades, yet it is unharmed; drench it with water, yet it is not soaked; scorch it with fire, yet it is not burned. All was shown for this reason.

Master Hu’s mind—when mourned with death, he received it without aversion; when celebrated with life, he received it without joy; when named as uneven, he received it without contention. In the end, the other lost himself and vanished, neither taking it as a gain nor feeling elated—this too was shown through emptiness.

Zhuang Zhou was discussing the governance of emperors and kings when he spoke of this. For emperors and kings to respond to the world, they must remain still and unmoving—only then can they resonate and penetrate all things. Only by withdrawing and concealing themselves can they share in the fortunes and misfortunes of the people. If one emerges from this origin, fretting over the world as one’s own burden, enslaving the ten thousand things rather than being enslaved by them, allowing others to perceive and assess you—how could this be? This is why the ancient emperors and kings were vast and beyond all naming.

The Dark Pearl—north of the Red Waters, its source holds yang yet does not flow...

The Kunlun peaks stand serene, their substance unshaken and undisturbed. By nature’s own foundation, when one gazes south, things intersect and arise into view; when one returns, movement is traversed and cycles complete. Yet those whose nature inverts the Great—once their faculties open, the dusty realm arises in full, and having sunk into human artifice, they drift far from the Great Dao. Is the Dark Pearl then lost?

Yet nature cannot be known through others—who then is the one who enacts it? Nature cannot be known through intent—who then is the one who seeks it? To enact it is not to gather emptiness; to seek it is not to silently accord. These three masters exhausted their wisdom in pursuit of what they wished to know, strained their eyes in pursuit of what they wished to see, and spent their words in pursuit of what they wished to say—yet the Dao remained forever beyond reach.

Why is it that where dust gathers and clods form, the wondrous Dao abides in full; where tiles and chaff lie scattered, the utmost truth resides? It is neither distant from the space between one’s brows nor separate from the primal image. It flows forth from the realm of the square inch, sprawling across the moments of daily use. Pursue it, and it darkens—though the mountain stands before you, it grows ever more distant. Question it, and it swells—though the clod has not shifted, all becomes confusion. This is because it cannot be sought.

Moreover, nature is originally without knowledge, yet what is called "knowledge" is not knowledge. Nature is originally without sight, yet what is called "sight" is not sight. Nature is originally without speech, yet what is called "speech" is not speech. If one takes knowledge to be nature and seeks knowledge through knowledge, one becomes deluded by knowledge. If one takes sight to be nature and seeks sight through sight, one becomes bound by sight. If one takes speech to be nature and seeks speech through speech, one becomes fettered by speech.

Call it "image"—it seems to exist yet does not. Call it "net"—it seems not to exist yet does. Abandoning wisdom, the deluded become numinous; abandoning sight, the bound become clear; abandoning speech, the fettered become free. This is how the "net" alone attains it.

When probing the root of the Dao, even a sage like the Yellow Emperor, upon gazing, lost it; a fool like the Net, without intent, gained it. Yet when one darkly fathoms the source of the Great Dao, a single nature is without nature—attainment is not sagely; a single truth is without truth—loss is not mundane. The Yellow Emperor’s loss earlier suffered not the slightest lack; the Net’s gain now enjoys not the slightest excess. In an instant, spanning ancient and present, the true constant stands alone revealed. Great delusion and great numinosity alike awaken to nature—how could one know that the three masters’ failure was not right, while the Net’s attainment was not wrong? Thus, even the Yellow Emperor singled it out as exceptional.

**Hao Bridge**

What all things share is shared in the One. What the One shares is shared in the Dao. Where the Dao extends, there is no origin from which it comes. The living live of themselves, yet life originally has no life. The formed take form of themselves, yet form originally has no form. All that spreads across appearances, sounds, and colors possesses this Dao without exception. What do I choose among things?

The allotment of a single nature is replete and without lack; the wandering of a single heaven is carefree and without burden. Things and I both possess it. Only those who accord with the knowledge of things and self—here, there is knowing without seeking to know, a wondrous dark accord, a principle silently met, first received by the spirit. Those who cannot escape wandering in its wake—this is why Zhuangzi knew the fish’s joy above the Hao Bridge.

To emerge and roam, to swim without wetting one’s scales, free from the peril of nets and snares, at ease within a single stretch of water—is this what constitutes the fish’s joy? If this is joy, the *Qi Xie* already knew it—why wait for Zhou to know it later? For the fish’s joy lies in the Dao, not in the water. What Zhou knew lay in joy, not in the fish. Only when the fish forgets the water is its joy complete. Only when Zhou forgets the fish is his knowledge whole.

Ultimate joy is without joy—the fish does not know the joy of its joy. True knowledge is without knowledge—Zhou does not seek to know yet knows. Yet Zhuang Zhou, in this accord beyond all things, was about to fall silent; Huizi, having once shared a bond of mutual resonance, was about to cease questioning. Zhuangzi was not incapable of silence here; Huizi was not incapable of awakening. But without questioning, Zhou’s words would have no ground; without words, the Dao’s wonder would have no manifestation. He sought only to loosen the world’s later generations from the fetter of dividing self and things.

If things inherently possess their own thingness, then Zhou was certainly not the fish—how could he know the fish’s joy through knowing me? If I inherently possess my own self, then the fish was certainly not Zhou—how could I know that I do not know the fish’s joy? Knowledge and ignorance are both branches of the Dao—this is why Zhou asked to trace it to its root. Its root has never been unknown. The ancients once spoke of it: the eye is like the ear, the ear like the nose, the nose like the mouth—none differ. In myself, all is thus: seeing death as life, wealth as poverty, Zhou as fish, others as swine, myself as others. In things, all is thus: thus, every thing arrives in full, and every wandering is a wondrous place—why only above the Hao Bridge? Thus, every thing is real, and every joy is heavenly harmony—why only the minnow’s joy?

I know that Zhou and the fish were never divided. Yet in composing the "Autumn Floods," he began with the River Lord and North Sea boasting of their small and great domains, followed by the worm, Kui, snake, and wind pitying one another in the realm of having and lacking—how could they know the oneness of things and the wholeness of joy? Thus, Zhou entrusted the minnow’s joy to complete his meaning, and the discourse on ultimate joy arose from this.

The ancients who understood that ultimate joy is without possession often revealed it in their words: "What joy? What aversion?" To grasp things as existing—what one sees is truly a carriage.

To take oneself as real—what one knows is truly a fall. With knowledge and perception established, the distinction between riding and falling arises—how could this not bring harm? That drunken man, whole in his wine: knowledge dissolves in it, perception darkens in it. Riding, he knows not the carriage; falling, he knows not the earth; his body knows not the impact, the impact knows not the wound. All is frozen, undivided.

And this temporary entrustment of wholeness to wine—is it not enough to transcend life and death, to forget fear? Is the wholeness of inherent nature and Heaven ever truly lost? Yet the world presents a single carriage, and those who cling to it, riding atop it—within, they open the ceaseless toil of knowledge and perception; without, they chase the restless illusions of change. Once they topple into the realm of delusions, it is not merely their bones that are harmed or fear that enters. Once they open themselves to the myriad forms, all pour in—like the sober man who sees the carriage overturn, how could he escape unscathed?

Nevertheless, at the origin of form, Heaven and Earth are born with me. Before the beginning of numbers, the myriad things and I are one. What thing is the carriage? What thing is the man? What thing is the fall? What thing is the wound? When mind opposes things, Heaven is split from man; when mind merges with things, man departs from Heaven. When mechanisms are cast aside, what follows is Heavenly principle; when distinctions dissolve, what is embodied is Heavenly harmony. To move without trace is called "Heavenly wandering"; to act without disturbance is called "Heavenly mechanism." That which nothing can trouble is Heavenly joy; that which nothing can beautify is Heavenly harmony. By this, one aligns with Heaven—nothing is added; by this, one serves Heaven—nothing is enslaved. This is called "wholeness in Heaven."

Those who view gain and loss as one, joy and death as continuous—are they not like the drunken man who falls from the carriage? Tracing Zhuang Zhou’s intent, he expounded this in the "Attaining Life" chapter, saying: "All that has life must perish; all that perishes must have life." Knowing that life is fundamentally non-life, he said: "Inwardly observe." Without mind, outwardly observe; without self, observe all things; without objects, one can unify one’s nature without duality, nurture one’s qi without depletion, harmonize one’s virtue without separation, and penetrate to the source of things without acting—where then is there no Heaven? When form is whole in Heaven, the forms of forms have never existed; when the ear is whole in Heaven, the sounds of sounds have never arisen; when the eye is whole in Heaven, the colors of colors have never appeared; when the mouth is whole in Heaven, the flavors of flavors have never been presented. This is called "wholeness in Heaven."

This chapter first entrusted its meaning to the drunken man’s fall from the carriage, then followed with the rushes that do not break Mo Ye’s blade, and then with the craftsman whose skill is not resentful of flying tiles. Why? Things are inherently without things—what mind is there for existence? I am inherently without self—what mind is there for things? Things and I were never divided. Thus, the falling man is not harmed, the rushes are not broken, the flying tiles are not resented—all is the self-emptiness of Heaven. Yet when contrasted with man, it is called "Heaven"; when nature is without nature, is there death in Heaven? When contrasted with openness, it is called "concealment"; when Heaven is without Heaven, how can it pair with concealment? Realizing this, one then grasps the wondrous essence of "Attaining Life."

**Daoist Techniques**
Those of old who spoke of the Dao asked: "Where does the Dao reside?" They answered: "There is nowhere it does not reside." Did they mean it resides in existence? The ancients have spoken of this: In the ancient, it is not ancient; in the present, it is not present; in yin, it is not yin; in yang, it is not yang. In the distant, it does not leave the space between the brows; in the near, it alone stands before images. In gathering, it flows forth into the ten thousand things; in scattering, it gathers even the finest hair.

Is the Dao truly in existence? Did they mean it resides in nothingness? The ancients have spoken of this: In Heaven, it is Heaven; on Earth, it is Earth; in valleys, it fills valleys; in pits, it fills pits. It exists in ants, in tiles and rubble. Is the Dao truly in nothingness? Nothingness is not in nothingness—it is called "nothingness," yet true nothingness is not nothing. Existence is not in existence—it is called "existence," yet true existence is not existence. That which is in all places—existence and nothingness cannot name it.

Those of old who illuminated the wondrousness of "in all places" throughout the world dared not compare it to forms or numbers, dared not glance at it through the lens of disturbance or boundaries. Following its eternal self-completion through past and present, its unity amidst scattering and difference—they reluctantly named it "the Ancient." The great essence of man is like the reflection of one moon in ten thousand waters, the roar of one wind through ten thousand hollows, the accumulation of one qi in ten thousand forms, the origin of one Dao in ten thousand things. The spiritually enlightened attain it and descend; emperors and kings attain it and give life. Heavenly and earthly beings attain it without departing from their source; spiritual beings attain it without departing from their essence; perfected beings attain it without departing from their truth.

The sage transforms through it; the noble person practices kindness and benevolence through it. It is the standard for laws, names, and the arts of governance; it is the pattern for the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music. The ancients who took this as their Daoist technique were not burdened in mind—thus it cannot be called "mind technique"; not carved by wisdom—thus it cannot be called "wisdom technique"; not a mechanism—thus it cannot be called "mechanical technique"; not a skill—thus it cannot be called "technical skill." To call this technique "the Dao" is to encompass its vastness.

Alas! The great wholeness was shattered by the scattering of the single Dao of virtue. The Hundred Schools and various masters, following their own views, became self-entangled, believing Daoist techniques resided in their particular doctrines. They did not sing in life, did not weep in death—Mo Di and Qin Guli heard of this way and delighted in it. They did too much for others, too little for themselves—Song Keng and Yin Wen heard of this way and delighted in it. They mocked the esteemed without bearing responsibility, indulged without restraint and rejected the great sages—Pang Meng and Shen Dao heard of this way and delighted in it.

With humility as their outward form, with emptiness and non-contention as their essence—Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of this way and delighted in it. These several masters, some became entangled in the Dao through their insistence on solitary burden-bearing, some through their relentless clamor, some through their doctrines of life and death, some through their expansive domains. Measuring their arts within the Dao, they are as a clod of earth in a great marsh, as a grain of millet in the grand granary, as a pebble upon Mount Tai, as a hair’s tip upon a horse’s body. Though their expressed views differ, when observed from the Dao they have attained, one cannot perceive their divergence. Why is this? Does a single stone’s insignificance equal Mount Tai in forming a whole? Does a single grain’s minuteness equal the grand granary in completing its count? Does a clod share the same emptiness as the great marsh? Does a hair’s tip not fulfill the horse’s body? Though the Hundred Schools have fragmented the Dao in myriad directions, its great body has never truly departed.

Alas! Without the Hundred Schools, the great wholeness would not exist; without the great wholeness, the Hundred Schools would not stand. Without the Hundred Schools, the great wholeness would not be seen; without the great wholeness, the Hundred Schools would have no foundation—their origin is one. Those who go through life within the great wholeness yet do not know it are the common people. Those who aspire to the great wholeness yet have not attained it are the worthy. Those who have fully realized the great wholeness yet efface its traces are the sages. Yao and Shun’s transmission of rule was the transmission of this. Yu and Tang’s passing of the throne was the passing of this. The Duke of Zhou’s reverent contemplation was the contemplation of this. Confucius’s profound devotion was the devotion to this. Mencius’s cultivation of vastness was the cultivation of this. Yi Yin’s foreknowledge was the foreknowledge of this.

Zhuang Zhou’s book concludes with this chapter, deeply embracing the root of the great Dao, squarely refuting the flaws of the Hundred Schools, yet ultimately placing himself among these masters with his unfathomable discourse and boundless words. Profoundly exposing the traces of his own writing, he thereby sanctifies the world. Who in later ages could claim Zhuang Zhou was obscured by heaven and became a one-sided scholar?
