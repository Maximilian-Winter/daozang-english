**The *Yi Lin* (Forest of Changes)**

**Title:** *Yi Lin* (also known as *Jiao Shi Yi Lin*, *Master Jiao’s Forest of Changes*). Authored by Jiao Gong of the Han dynasty. The *Sui Shu·Jing Ji Zhi* records this work in sixteen juan, though the present edition comprises ten juan. Source of the base text: *Wanli Xu Daozang* (Continuation of the Daoist Canon from the Wanli Era).

**Preface to the Sequence of the Upper and Lower Hexagrams of the *Yi Lin***

All transformations and images, all numbers and symbols, are inescapably bound to the *Yi*. Yet of all things, the deceits and truths of human nature are the most difficult to discern. Diviners still practice their art, dwelling alongside the anxious, offering wisdom and foresight—thus was this method preserved.

Yu Yan tilled the fields in the eastern wilds, his vision clouded by hardship. A visitor, deigning to call at his thatched hut, presented him with several scrolls of Jiao’s verses. Yu had once read the biographies in the works of Ban [Gu] and Sima [Qian], as well as the genealogies of eminent ministers through the ages and the writings of various scholars. These texts all extolled how, after Confucius transmitted the *Yi* to Shang Qu, barely ten successors remained; how Yan Shou passed down the classics and commentaries to Meng Xi, who was his contemporary. During the reigns of Emperors Yuan and Cheng of the Western Han, when governance declined, Master Jiao would emerge or retreat as circumstances demanded, always presenting the Dao of the *Yi* to the Prince of Liang. Thereupon, he was recommended by the commandery and appointed magistrate of Xiaohuang. Yet even the hidden affairs of the district were foreknown to him, earning him special favor, promotions in rank, and ultimately, his death in office.

His work, *The Comprehensive Transformations of the Great Yi*, comprises a total of four thousand ninety-six hexagram entries. Though its scope is vast, it converges in simplicity; its phrases borrow from the classics and histories, yet their meaning aligns with the divine. Pure, precise, and single-minded, every judgment proves accurate. The words are plain, but their import profound—easily grasped yet difficult to exhaust. One must not dismiss them as mere verbosity. For later enthusiasts who seek to understand your conduct, Master Ziyun’s work shall endure as immortal.

**Preface to the Collated *Yi Lin* of Jiao Gong**

By Huang Bosi, Gentleman for Consultation and Collator of the Palace Library, acting in his official capacity:

In the collation of Jiao Yanshou’s *Yi Lin*, certain characters were found to be erroneous—*kuai* (快) written as *yang* (怏), *yang* (羊) as *shou* (手), *xi* (喜) as *jia* (嘉), *he* (鹤) as *que* (鹊)—though their meanings may be retained in both forms.

Jiao Yanshou, whose given name was Gong, was a native of Liang. Through his devotion to learning, he gained the favor of the Prince of Liang, who provided for his needs and allowed him to study without restraint. Upon completing his studies, he served as a commandery official and was appointed magistrate of Xiaohuang. Whenever thieves were about to strike, he knew of it beforehand, and thus none dared act. His merit earned him promotion, and the officials and people petitioned to retain him. The imperial decree granted him an increase in rank, and he died in office at Xiaohuang.

The world speaks of Yanshou’s method thus: when divining a hexagram, one observes the corresponding forest of changes to determine fortune or misfortune. If the hexagram and lines remain unchanged, one simply examines the verses of the original hexagram and its lines. There was a man named Wang Bi who, in the second year of the Yongxi era, encountered an extraordinary person and divined the hexagram *Guan* (觀) transforming into *Bi* (賁). The *Lin* stated: *"Eastward travel has no gate; westward, one exits Mount Hua. The path is blocked by peril, and the wanderer meets with calamity."* These words proved most accurate. Those who come after must not fail to discern their meaning.

The works composed by Yanshou, though belonging to the divination texts of the Yin-Yang school, were written in the mid-Western Han, not long after the Three Dynasties. Their language is refined and unadorned, offering much worthy of perusal. Here, they are respectfully recorded.

*Miscellaneous Records*
The Elder Fei Zhi of Donglai said: The method of divination through the sixty-four hexagrams’ transformations was compiled by Jiao Yanshou of Tianshui, styled Jianxin, during the reign of Wang Mang. The *Yi* is vast and great indeed. Speaking of what is distant, it cannot be exhausted; speaking of what is near, it is still and correct; speaking of what lies between Heaven and Earth, it is complete. Yet the *Yi* refers to the sixty-four hexagrams—when extended further, it surpasses even the *Shuogua* in what it reveals. Thus, the *Lianshan*, *Guicang*, and *Zhouyi* all differ in their words yet share the same hexagrams. Though the three schools circulated concurrently, they still represent but one corner. Gong excelled in Yin-Yang studies and further devised this method to illuminate what the *Yi* had not yet shown. His predictions of fortune and misfortune, survival and ruin, often proved accurate when they matched the category of the matter at hand. For trivial or unrelated affairs, however, they often failed. Gong’s mastery of subtle principles was but one corner of the sage’s wisdom. Yanshou alone inherited the teachings of the recluses.

The *Book of Han* states: Jing Fang, styled Junming, studied the *Yi* under Jiao Yanshou of Liang, whose given name was Gong. Gong was poor and of low status but devoted to learning, earning the favor of the King of Liang, who provided for his needs and allowed him to study to his heart’s content. After completing his studies, he became a local official and was later recommended for promotion to magistrate of Xiaohuang.

Having anticipated and detected treachery and villainy in advance, he prevented the outbreak of theft and banditry. He cherished and nurtured the officials and common folk, so that moral transformation flourished throughout the county. When selected as the most outstanding for promotion, the village elders and his subordinates petitioned to retain Gong, and an imperial edict granted him an increased stipend to remain. He eventually died in Xiaohuang.

Gong once remarked: “The one who will bring ruin upon himself through me is Jing.” His teachings excelled in interpreting disasters and omens. He divided the sixty hexagrams, assigning each to govern a day in sequence, using wind, rain, cold, and warmth as observational signs, each with its own prognostications. Fang applied these methods with particular precision.

Meng Kang notes: The method of assigning hexagrams to days operates such that one line governs one day, and sixty hexagrams account for three hundred and sixty days. The remaining four hexagrams—*Zhen* (Thunder), *Li* (Fire), *Dui* (Lake), and *Kan* (Water)—serve as the officials overseeing the regional lords and inspectors. The reason for employing *Zhen*, *Li*, *Kan*, and *Dui* is that they correspond to the days of the solstices and equinoxes, when the qi of the four seasons each holds sway in turn. Each hexagram governs a day, and the method of divination involves observing auspicious and inauspicious signs on its respective day.

*Recorded Verifications* by Cheng Jiong of Shasui.

During the closing years of the Xuanhe era, Chancellor Cui of Changqingfu served as prefect of a commandery. At that time, the realm was at peace, and he reverently consulted this sacred text, casting the hexagram *Daguo* (Great Exceeding), which read:

*"The canonical records and legal texts,*
*Stored in the Orchid Terrace.*
*Though chaos and ruin spread,*
*They alone escape disaster."*

He then drew the line statement for *Dun* (Retreat):

*"The seat still warm,*
*Trouble knocks at the door.*
*Over the wall to flee north—*
*Soldiers come behind,*
*Yet one escapes the tiger’s jaws."*

Ten days after his divination, the commandery fell into turmoil. Chancellor Cui scaled the wall and fled, his family unharmed and untouched by misfortune. Upon returning to the capital, he recognized that this book was the work of a sage. Though its meanings were initially difficult to grasp, upon later reflection, none failed to align with events. Those who encounter it should hold it in utmost reverence. Gold itself is precious, yet it cannot compare to the worth of this text.

At the end of the Shaoxing era, Wanyan Liang invaded. Someone then consulted Jiao Gong’s *Forest of Changes* and cast the hexagram *Jie* (Deliverance) transforming into *Dazhuang* (Great Strength), which read:

*"The arrogant Hu, fiery in form,*
*Devises evil and commits atrocities.*
*Nothing he undertakes succeeds—*
*He brings ruin upon himself."*

So precise was its correspondence that even the celestial net’s gentle breeze could not surpass it. Since the dawn of time, only Liang could be said to fulfill this prophecy. How did Yan Shou, in composing his work, foresee that later ages would produce such a figure? Was it because Han-dynasty Jiao Yanshou transmitted the *Changes* to Meng Xi? The account appears in the *"Biographies of Confucian Scholars."* This is the very book he authored.

At the front of the text, Fei Zhi inscribed a preface, stating: "The sixty-four hexagrams transform [into one another]." Later, Wang Yu of the Tang dynasty added a preface. Each hexagram transforms into sixty-four variations, totaling four thousand ninety-six verses, all composed in rhyming lines. These closely resemble the phrases recorded in the *Zuo Tradition*—such as *"Phoenixes in flight, harmonious their cries, resonant and clear"*—or those in the *Book of Han*—such as *"Great Cross, geng-geng, I am the Heavenly King."* Could it be that diviners of antiquity possessed such texts?

In the cyclical year *Zhaoyang Dahuangluo*, during the month of *Huangji*, on the day of the Supreme Ultimate, the divination ritual proceeds as follows:

**Divination Apparatus**
Select a clean, secluded space to establish the *shishi* (divination chamber), its door facing south. Place the *lin* (divination table) at the chamber’s center. The table should be roughly five *chi* in length and three *chi* in width, positioned not too close to the walls. Prepare fifty stalks of *shi* (yarrow), wrapped in fragrant silk and encased in a black pouch, then stored in a *du* (receptacle) placed to the north of the table. The *du* may be made of bamboo, sturdy wood, or lacquered cloth, with a circular diameter of three *cun*, matching the length of the *shi*. It should be half base, half lid, with a separate stand to prevent tipping. Set a wooden frame south of the *du*, positioned at the northern two-thirds of the table. The frame, constructed from horizontal wooden planks, should be one *chi* in height, spanning the table’s length, with two large notches carved at the center, spaced one *chi* apart. To the west of the large notches, three small notches are made, each spaced roughly five *cun* apart, with horizontal feet affixed to stand upright on the table. Place one incense burner south of the frame and one incense box south of the burner. Burn incense daily to show reverence.

Before divination, sweep and wipe the area clean. Prepare one inkstone with water, one brush, one inkstick, and one yellow-lacquered board, placing them to the east of the burner, aligned from east to west.

The diviner, having purified himself and donned clean robes and cap, faces north, washes his hands, and burns incense to pay respects. The diviner’s northward orientation follows the *Etiquette and Ceremonial*. If someone else commissions the divination, the host burns incense, then steps back slightly to stand facing north. The diviner advances, stands slightly west of the table’s front, and faces south to receive the inquiry. The host states the matter to be divined directly, and the diviner assents. The host turns right and stands facing west, while the diviner turns right to face north.

With both hands, the diviner lifts the lid of the *du*, places it south of the frame and north of the burner, removes the *shi* from the *du*, discards the pouch and silk wrapping, and sets them east of the *du*. Combining the fifty stalks, he holds them in both hands and passes them over the incense burner. The subsequent use of the *shi* stalks follows the explanations in the *Primer of Enlightenment*.

He then recites the invocation:
*"By your greatness, O stalks, divination has its constancy;*
*By your greatness, O stalks, divination has its constancy.*
*[Name and title of the inquirer] now seeks clarity on [matter in question].*
*Is it auspicious or inauspicious? Will there be gain or loss, regret or remorse, worry or peril?*
*You, who are spiritually attuned, I beseech to reveal the truth."*

With his right hand, he takes one stalk and sets it aside in the *du*. Then, dividing the remaining forty-nine stalks with both hands, he places them in the left and right large notches of the frame. This is the first operation, *"dividing into two to symbolize the Two [Forces]."*

Next, with his left hand, he takes the stalks from the left large notch and holds them, while with his right hand, he removes one stalk from the right large notch and *"hangs"* it between the little finger of his left hand. This is the second operation, *"hanging one to symbolize the Three [Powers]."*

Then, with his right hand, he counts off the stalks in his left hand in groups of four. This is half of the third operation, *"counting by fours to symbolize the four seasons."*

He then gathers the remaining stalks—whether one, two, three, or four—and *"binds"* them between the ring finger of his left hand. This is half of the fourth operation, *"returning the remainder to the bind to symbolize the intercalary [month]."*

Next, he returns the counted stalks from his right hand to the left large notch, then takes the stalks from the right large notch and holds them, counting them off in groups of four with his left hand. This is the other half of the third operation. He then gathers the remaining stalks as before and binds them between the middle finger of his left hand. This is the other half of the fourth operation, *"binding again to symbolize the second intercalary [month]."*

After the first change, the remaining stalks will follow this pattern: if one remains on the left, three must remain on the right; if two on the left, two on the right; if three on the left, one on the right; if four on the left, four on the right. Including the *"hung"* stalk, the total will be either five or nine. Five, when its four are counted as one, becomes odd; nine, when its four are counted as two, becomes even. Thus, there are three odds to one even.

He then returns the counted stalks from his right hand to the right large notch and places the one *"hung"* and two *"bound"* stalks onto the first small notch of the frame, with the east side as the upper position (subsequent placements follow this order). This completes the first change.

Next, he combines the stalks from the left and right large notches—either forty-four or forty stalks—and repeats the four operations as in the first change, placing the *"hung"* and *"bound"* stalks onto the second small notch of the frame. This completes the second change.

After the second change, the remaining stalks follow this pattern: if one remains on the left, two must remain on the right; if two on the left, one on the right; if three on the left, four on the right; if four on the left, three on the right. Including the *"hung"* stalk, the total will be either four or eight. Four, when its four are counted as one, becomes odd; eight, when its four are counted as two, becomes even. Thus, odds and evens each account for two of the four possibilities.

Once more, he combines the stalks from the left and right large notches—either forty, thirty-six, or thirty-two stalks—and repeats the four operations as in the second change, placing the *"hung"* and *"bound"* stalks onto the third small notch of the frame. This completes the third change. The remaining stalks after the third change follow the same pattern as the second.

After the three changes, he examines the *"hung"* and *"bound"* stalks obtained from each change and draws the line on the board. If the *"hung"* and *"bound"* stalks total five or four, they are odd; if nine or eight, they are even. If the three *"hung"* and *"bound"* counts are all odd (thirteen stalks), then the stalks counted through (*guoshe*) total thirty-six, forming an *"old yang"* line, drawn as ⚊ (a solid line), known as *"double."*

If the *"hung"* and *"bound"* stalks total two odd and one even (seventeen stalks), then the stalks counted through (*guoshe*) number thirty-two, forming a *"young yin"* line, drawn as -- (a broken line), known as *"split."* If the *"hung"* and *"bound"* stalks total two even and one odd (twenty-one stalks), then the stalks counted through number twenty-eight, forming a *"young yang"* line, drawn as 一 (a single solid line), known as *"single."* If the *"hung"* and *"bound"* stalks total three even (twenty-five stalks), then the stalks counted through number twenty-four, forming an *"old yin"* line, drawn as ⚋ (a double broken line), known as *"crossed."* Thus, every three changes form a line.

The first, fourth, seventh, tenth, thirteenth, and sixteenth changes—six in total—follow the same pattern. However, from the third change onward, the count is not announced, and only forty-nine stalks are used. The second, fifth, eighth, eleventh, fourteenth, and seventeenth changes—six in total—also follow the same pattern. The third, sixth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth, and eighteenth changes—six in total—likewise follow the same pattern. In all, eighteen changes form a hexagram. Then, one examines the hexagram’s transformations to divine the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of the matter. Diagrams and explanations of hexagram transformations are found in *Qimeng*.

When the ritual is complete, the diviner conceals the stalks, wraps them, places them in a case, covers it, gathers the brush and inkstone, and the black board. Then, he burns incense, pays respects, and retires. If someone else performs the divination, the host burns incense, bows to the diviner, and retreats.

**Alternative Method Using Objects**
Zhu Yong states: Divining the *Changes* with milfoil stalks is the ancient method. In recent times, coins have been used to cast lines for convenience, but this cannot fully embody the Way of divination. Traditionally, the side of a coin with characters was considered yin, and the blank side yang. Thus, two tails (yin) formed a *"split"* (--), a broken line, while two heads (yang) formed a *"single"* (一), a solid line. Zhu Xi, however, held that the side with characters was the *face* (yang), and the blank side the *back* (yin). Since all things’ faces belong to yang and backs to yin, he reversed the old method, and scholars of Jian’an universally adopted his view. Some say that in ancient times, metal was cast into cowries or coins called *dao* or *quan*, with the yin side bearing inscriptions like the reverse of a mirror. Whether one side was yin and the other yang remains uncertain.

Generally, divination must use milfoil stalks; if seeking simplicity, the method must still be exhaustive. I once crafted three wooden spheres, each with six faces. On three faces of each sphere, three lines were carved; on the other three, two lines. When cast, they encompass all variations of old/young yin and yang. The three spheres, each with six faces, embody the principle of eighteen changes. Three faces (three lines each) represent the nine of *Qian* (☰), while three faces (two lines each) represent the six of *Kun* (☷). This reflects the use of spheres and the number eight.

The three lines of *Qian*’s single line contain three, while the two lines of *Kun*’s single line divide into two—this is the doctrine of *"three heavens, two earths."* When all three spheres land on three, they form nine, the number of *"old yang."* When all land on two, they form six, the number of *"old yin."* Two twos and one three form seven, the number of *"young yang."* Two threes and one two form eight, the number of *"young yin."* The lines of *Qian* and *Kun* are used to form the eight trigrams, symbolizing *Qian* and *Kun* giving birth to the six children.

The spheres represent the One of the Supreme Ultimate. Three threes form *Qian* (☰), and three twos form *Kun* (☷), symbolizing the Two (yin and yang). The three spheres represent the Three Powers: Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Each sphere’s total is fifteen, the number of the *Luoshu*’s supreme pole. The combined total of the three spheres is forty-five, the number of the *Hetu*’s nine palaces. If two appear above, three lie below; if three appear above, two lie below—movement and stillness both yield five. Thus, five is concealed within the operation, and when combined with forty-five, it becomes the *Dayan*’s number of fifty.

When three spheres form nine above, three spheres conceal six below—this is the body of *"old yang"* transforming into yin. When three spheres form six above, three spheres conceal nine below—this is the body of *"old yin"* transforming into yang. Two and three oppose each other, and each sphere contains three and five—this is the principle of *"interweaving and varying numbers."* The spheres are round and revolving, embodying ceaseless change. The six positions interact, circulating through the six voids. Three spheres cast six times complete a day, also reflecting the principle of eighteen changes.

This method avoids the ambiguity of coin faces and backs regarding yin and yang, while encompassing all variations of old/young yin and yang. I have shared this with like-minded scholars, who found it reasonable, and thus recorded the method for the world to follow.

When a hexagram’s lines are obtained, old lines change while young lines do not. If a line changes, a new hexagram is derived. The sequence of hexagrams in the *Yilin*’s *Upper and Lower Canon* concludes here.

The original text mistakenly writes "一" (one); based on the context, it should be corrected to "一" (one).

**Zhengyi Daozang: Continuation of the Daoist Canon**
*Yilin, Upper Classic, Scroll Four*
**Hexagram #20: Guan (Observation)**

**Guan (觀)**
Beneath the Lishan peaks,
Where Yu and Tang once dwelt.
Plowing with filial devotion,
His fame resounded across the four seas.
Recommended by Yao,
He received the abdicated throne of the Son of Heaven.
*"Tang"* should read *"Shun."*

**Qian (乾)**
Graceful flight and writhing motion,
Each finds its match.
Joyfully they greet one another,
All secure in their place.

**Kun (坤)**
Continuing ancestral sacrifices in the capital,
Emulating the brightness of Cheng and Kang.
Radiance illumines the myriad states,
Enjoying enduring prosperity through the ages.
Sickness left unhealed,
One descends to the thatched hut of mugwort.
*These two lines are suspected of being interpolated.*

**Zhun (屯)**
Searching nests in autumn and winter,
No magpie chicks are found.
Clutching a finger, she departs northward,
Bereaving me of my young concubine.

**Meng (蒙)**
A young maidservant sleeps alone,
The eldest daughter remains unwed,
No advantage to be gained.

**Xu (需)**
Mighty waves surge against the current,
The Perfected One dives into concealment.
Mugwort and fleabane replace pillars,
The great hall collapses.

**Song (訟)**
Daylight dims,
Slanderers occupy the hall.
The right arm is stricken with numbness,
The lord loses his brilliance.

**Shi (師)**
The prince’s youngest son,
Together they embody filial piety and fraternal love.
Bright, trustworthy, sincere, and earnest,
Promoted and recommended,
They become the pillars of the state.

**Bi (比)**
Qilin hooves and dragon’s body,
Three thousand steeds harnessed to the sun.
Ascending south to Cangwu,
They wed with fortune.

The Way is level and smooth,
Safe and free from harm.

**Small Accumulation**
Three colts grow strong,
Yet break the axle and shaft.
Wheels bear an empty carriage,
Late and missing the appointed time.

**Treading**
Pursuing fortune and dispelling harm,
With Dao and virtue, one becomes a divine immortal.
Avoiding evil for ten thousand leagues,
Ever joyful and at peace.

**Greatness**
At the covenant of Huangchi,
Wu and Chu contend in might.
Goujian brings calamity,
And the Eastern Gate knows no peace.
Delving into the valley, one finds worms—
What was wished for brings no joy.

**Obstruction**
A black ox with a white throat
Calls me to the fields together.
Beneath Mount Li,
One may till abundantly.
When the season stores its harvest,
A single man ensures peace.
He calls me—or beckons me—to the fields.

**Fellowship**
A head without eyes,
Glorious yet grainless.
(Or: No beans or millet are seen.)
Wasting becomes sickness,
And for three years, no recovery.

**Great Possession**
Mountains sink, hills float,
Land turns to water, fish abound.
Swallows and sparrows have no nests,
The people no homes.

**Modesty**
On the lofty ridge, the phoenix,
Facing the morning sun, the wutong tree.
Harmonious and flourishing,
Lush and verdant.
Few words suffice
To bring good tidings.

**Delight**
Widows and widowers sleep alone,
Worry stirs in their hearts,
None to share laughter or food.

**Following**
A stumbling horse breaks the cart,
Evil spirits descend upon the house.
Flies defile the white,
And Gongzi departs in solitude.

**Decay**
The eldest daughter twice wed,
Advancing and retreating without shame.
Chasing foxes, stirring mischief,
Travelers meet with sorrow.

**Approach**
Men lack proper conduct,
Slackness breeds long deceit.
The earth’s might favors retreat,
Yang fails to restrain yin,
And men lose their homes.

**Biting Through**
Feeding on mushrooms and yellow herbs,
Consuming jade blossoms.
In communion with the spirits,
Ever free from sorrow and misfortune.

**Adornment**
Bound and without a path,
Westward to Mount Hua.
The Way is blocked by peril,
And wanderers meet with calamity.

**Splitting Apart**
One brother like Peng and Wang,
With the sun and moon abides.
Ever secure and joyful,
Unscathed by misfortune.

**Return**
Delving into the husk, one finds lice—
What was wished for brings no joy.
At the covenant of Huangchi,
Wu and Chu contend in might.
Goujian brings calamity,
And the Eastern Gate knows no peace.

**Supreme Delusion**
Bats and moths bear young,
Dark-eyed and black-faced.
Though adorned and refined,
The multitude will not accept them.

**Great Accumulation**
Anger untimely,
Frost and snow become disaster.

**Harvest and Cultivation**
No merit in sowing and reaping,
Hou Ji suffers cold and hunger.

**Nourishment**
Crows ascend, magpies take flight,
Illuminating the Eastern Sea.
The dragon descends to the courtyard,
Becoming the heir of Tao Shu.
Enfeoffed at Liaoqiu,
His steps tread upon abundant fortune.

**Great Exceeding**
Yellow departs, white daylight,
Shining upon my four lands.
The sovereign’s radiance bright,
The people rely on his blessings.

**The Abysmal**
Millet and sweet wine,
Reverently offered to the mountain’s spirit.
The gods relish the feast,
Sweet rain descends in bounty.
Alone they receive divine favor,
Seasonal disasters kept at bay.

**The Radiance**
Misfortune does not recur,
Fortune surpasses my village.
Entering the gate with laughter and joy,
Profit comes to me.

**Influence**
Lying by the pen’s gate at noon,
Restless and uneasy.
Eyes cannot close,
Ghosts scratch at my feet.

**Duration**
Spring grasses bloom in splendor,
The eldest daughter suits her husband.
Receiving abundant fortune and years,
Generations enjoy enfeoffment and emolument.

**Retreat**
The gate of Yong collapses within,
Villains harm the worthy and benevolent.
Violence and madness rage,
Duke Jian loses his throne.

**Great Strength**
A stout heart without goodness,
Rampant and reckless.
Butting against walls,
Doors and chambers unseen.

**Progress**
A carriage of glue, a horse of wood,
Unfit for distant trade.
Leaving brings misfortune,
Resting brings no peril.

**Darkening of the Light**
A home at the sea’s edge,
Oars too short, currents too deep.
Standing on tiptoe, gazing toward Song,
No means to hasten there.

**The Family**
Winter mulberries wither,
Lost to the wind’s way.
Shrouded in dust,
Left and right toil in hardship.

**Dispersion**
Missing the time, failing to act,
Blindly chasing lords and princes.
An old maid without a husband,
Her dwelling never at peace.

**Obstruction**
Treading in mud, soiling the feet,
Name besmirched, body shamed.
Two foes evenly matched,
Self-inflicted pain and grief.

**Deliverance**
Essence and bloom wither and fall,
Form and countenance grow foul.
Jarring and stumbling,
Withered, rotten, and worm-eaten.

**Decrease**
Life without end,
Descendants a thousandfold.
Pine and mulberry as beams,
Firm and unshaken.

**Increase**
Fleeing pungent for the desolate,
Poison grows ever more cruel.
Avoiding the well to fall into the pit,
Daily troubles arise.

**Breakthrough**
Following Yao’s reverent virtue,
Illustrious worthies gather in homage.
Heroes amass in multitude,
The land knows no bandits or thieves.

**Pregnancy**
A dog chases a fleeing hare,
Both enter the valley’s mouth.
Meeting a tiger there,
Pressed and unable to escape.

**Gathering**
Gazing toward Shang and Aheng,
The Grand Steward, the Duke of Zhou.
Shielding Tang and Wu,
Ennobled as lords and kings.

**Ascending**
The pure man, Gaozi,
Long encamped in the wilds.
Wandering without return,
Longing for my kind mother.

**Oppression**
Three worms gnaw as pests,
Erasing all traces, none to aid.
Shengmu and Daoquan,
No safe dwelling to be found.

**The Well**
The furnace shapes a dragon’s form,
No forward path to take.
Three days and five nights,
Attaining what is revered.

**Revolution**
Yellow wrapped in green robes,
Unfitting for the lord’s attire.
Indulgence and debauchery defile constancy,
Losing his favor and radiance.

**The Cauldron**
Heaven’s regard and protection,
No disaster or calamity befalls,
Secure and joyful, without fear.

**The Arousing**
Winding and twisting ninefold,
The road’s journey fraught with delay.
Stopping at a thousand hills,
Only then seeing what delights.

**Keeping Still**
Tyranny loses the state,
Driven out by those below.
Northward fleeing to Yin Hu,
The lord’s head shorn.

**Gradual Progress**
The chariot follows the dragon,
Arriving at Huo and Hua in the east.
Meeting Yu along the way,
Escorted to the child’s domain.

**Marrying Maiden**
Bronze men with iron heels,
Toiling in rain and dew.
All day, year’s end,
No rest or respite.

**Abundance**
The great officer errs,
Fullness followed by loss.
A tree grown to its height,
Flourishing then fading to decline.

**The Wanderer**
Plums and plums ripen in winter,
The land teems with thieves.
Chaos and disturbance erupt,
The king cannot control them.

**The Gentle**
The marsh dries, no fish,
The mountain barren, no trees.
The eldest daughter’s jealousy,
Leaves the body hollow.

**The Joyous**
The gate of heaven stands empty in winter,
Jin’s decline brings disaster.
Narrow and dark, silent and grim,
The Earl of Qin suffers misfortune.

**Dispersion**
Tearing clothes to ford the river,
Water soaks the garments deep.
Fortunate to meet a boatman,
Crossing safely without mishap.

**Moderation**
Pushing a cart up the mountain,
High and steep, the burden heavy.
From dawn till dusk,
The summit unseen.

**Inner Truth**
The cauldron’s ears are changed,
Too hot to lift.
The great road blocked,
Travelers’ hearts ache.

**Small Exceeding**
Fourfold chaos unsettles,
East and west bring misfortune.

**Withdrawal**
Withdraw the self, halt the steps,
Never leave the state’s bounds—
Thus preserved in wholeness,
Relying on life’s blessings.

**Completion**
The warhorses return in ranks,
To rest the weary and worn.
The conscripted men rejoice,
Entering their doors to see their wives.

**Incompletion**
Virtue accumulates without cease,
Meeting the lord in timely accord.
Bearing goodness—joy at the Wei’s banks—
The body receives glory’s light.

**Biting Through**
Qilin and phoenix,
Auspicious omens of good governance.
Yin and yang harmonized,
The state knows no calamity.

**Force**
The north wind draws near,
Lifting laughter and words.
Elder sings, younger dances,
Feasting in joy—
The north wind clasps hands.

**Field**
Jia, Wu, Ji, Geng move with the seasons,
Never losing their proper rhythm, all meet their birth.
Each delights in its kind,
Fulfilling nature, following desire.

**Sprouting**
The ruins of ruin,
A sorrow to the spirits.
Advancing virtue brings no light,
Yet staying brings good fortune.

**Youthful Folly**
Pouring in rich oils,
Praying to guard against all poisons.
Defended by the lands south of the river,
Vipers cannot strike.

**Waiting**
Sun and moon gaze upon each other,
Their radiance flourishing.
Three sages achieve success,
Great virtue descends.

**Conflict**
Great serpents and giant fish
Battle at the state’s outskirts.
High and low cut off,
The Marquis of Wei at Lucao.

**The Army**
The dragon enters Heaven’s Gate,
Traversing the nine mountains.
Climbing high and descending,
The road fraught with peril.
The sun wanes, no food—
No taste of sweet or sour.

**Alliance**
The northern desert’s frontier,
Utterly without springs.
The nobleman’s march brings misfortune,
The conscript’s strength is spent.

**Small Taming**
The latch undone, the door ajar,
The sash slips, the belt unravels.
Fortune and goodness arise,
Worry does not become disaster.

**Treading**
Where wolves and tigers howl,
Harm and ruin must befall.
No advantage in action—
Best to flee and hide.

**Peace**
Metal’s essence blazes in fury,
A sword drawn past noon.
Two tigers face each other,
Bows and crossbows fill the field—
Though troubled, no blame.

**Stagnation**
Rotten roots, withered trees,
Blossoms and leaves fallen.
Suddenly fire rages,
All collapse in its wake.

**Fellowship**
Entering harmony, exiting darkness,
Movement brings radiance.
Turning to rest and respite,
Ever joyful, long at peace.

**Great Possession**
The state brims with taboos,
The great ever in dread.
Sealing the mouth averts harm—
Thus may one endure.

**Modesty**
Heaven and earth pure and flourishing,
The six directions luminous.
Yin in order, yang in sequence,
Their work is accomplished.

**Enthusiasm**
Stripped bare, chasing the fox,
A laughingstock to others.
The hen crows at dawn—
The master stirs chaos and omen.

**Following**
Yin lost, yang restored,
Jie loses his chamber,
His minister starves, refusing food.

**Corruption**
Maggots fly, silkworms stir,
Each finds its mate.
Great and small protect one another,
All find their place.

**Approach and Enthusiasm**
**Approach**
A ghost guards my home,
Calling my elder brother away.
Yet the great-grandson lives long,
The Controller of Fate forbids it—
Life is preserved.

**Viewing**
Misfortune flees, peril hides,
Joy becomes my fortune.
Evil vanishes,
Disaster does not arise.

**Grace**
Wisdom fails to distinguish,
Deceit spreads recklessly.
Falling into the abyss, stumbling—
The elder is slain.

**Splitting Apart**
Ominous woe and calamity,
Growing ever clearer.
Disaster cannot be averted—
Three retreats, the Yi are wounded.

**Return**
A long-tailed dwarf serpent
Draws a river upon the earth.
Though one probes, it cannot be forded—
No path lies to the north,
Only sighs of frustration.

**Divergence**
Neighbors turn away,
Gazing toward the jade maiden.
My body covered in warts and sores—
Who would find me lovely?

**Obstruction**
Gazing afar, no light,
Uncertain of green or yellow.
The lamp’s oil clogs the ears,
Making me deaf to all.

**Deliverance**
Disciplining the self, ordering the body,
Encountering Yu’s royal progress.
Bestowed with a dark jade scepter,
I receive blessings and grace.

**Decrease**
Gazing a thousand *li*,
No black speck is seen.
Even Li Lou’s keen sight
Cannot brighten the light.

**Increase**
Where the axe falls,
Wounds and sores never cease.
The whetstone unused,
The lower chambers lie empty.

**Breakthrough**
The Marquis of Qi’s youngest son,
Talented and fair of form,
Seeks my eldest daughter—
The humble rushes are refused.
Instead, he obtains the ugly,
And later regrets it deeply.

**Pregnancy**
Losing one’s mate, traveling alone,
Between Heaven’s gate and Earth’s door.
Not knowing where to be,
Yet resting brings no blame.

Desires unshared,
Past her time, no match.

In search of carriage and horse,
The Way is blocked, halting mid-journey.

A great serpent brings calamity,
Blocking the path.

Instead, she sinks into lowliness.

Never to feed again.

Night becomes his chamber.

**Great Exceeding**
Strange and solitary, without a mate,
He practices stillness in seclusion.
His wishes unfulfilled,
His heart toils in sorrow.

**Peril**
Ge Wan is entangled in thorns,
Blossoms bear no fruit.
Slander and flattery disrupt governance,
Loyalty is stifled.

**Radiance**
The magpie laughs, the turtledove dances,
Bringing me wine.
Great joy follows,
Bestowing upon me a turtle-knotted seal.
The dragon rejoices, mouth agape,
Leaping to receive blessings.

It meets the wind—
Falling from the tree’s roots,
Its fate beyond salvation.

Gathering firewood to brew wine,
A matchmaker seeks a bride.
Harmony between Qi and Song,
The Jiang family rejoices.

**The Cauldron**
A three-legged lone crow,
Guided by numinous brightness.

Yet destroys its own house,
Bringing ruin and sorrow.

*(Continuation of "Breakthrough" into "Dispersal")*

**Thunder**
A chariot drawn by two worms,
The horse snaps its reins to walk.
The twin wheels detach and roll—
The perfect Dao meets harm.

*Alternate version:*
A glued cart is harnessed,
Two reins like taut cords.

The twin wheels tear free.

Together they steal the sun’s radiance.

Gladly scorching my hut.

The spring gushes against the pillars—
Though perilous, there is no blame.

Taking flight to the eastern state.

Never do they share the same hall.

Slander brought him home again—
Named "Upright Ox."
He carved chaos in Shusun’s house,
Starving on the barren hill.

Suddenly no love between them.
Hearts ever sorrowful,
Faces never glad.

To the ruins of Guo’s walls.
No trace of its tracks,
Evening brings disaster.

**Sui**
The forest monkey dons cap and sash,
A thief in a place not his own.
The pack of dogs barks,
The granary’s madman stumbles.

Hanging in fields just begun.
Mid-drought, no rain falls,
Winds wound, crops wither.

Sitting in peril till dusk,
Requests go unanswered.
Sweet rains do not fall,
Governance turns harsh, the people fierce.

A hundred rivers flow to the sea,
Their currents ceaseless.
Though the road be distant,
None fail to reach.

Eastward to the Ji River.

He sends me forth with gifts,
Returning home with great gain.

Yin’s pleas misplaced.
Chengzi’s arrogance,

Entering the tiger’s den.
The Queen Mother’s greed,
Steals my plow ox.

The distant lands submit.

Blessings without woe.

Trembling in fear,
Yet no disaster comes.
*(Sui’s Jian, Jing’s Pi, Zhong Fu’s Xiao Guo)*

**Cui**
Both eyes lose their sight,
The sun’s light stolen.
Lame and dragging,
Stumbling by the hillside.
The lost concubine not pursued,
Alone she sleeps in the wilderness.
*(Sheng)*

**Sheng**
The swan flies along the shore,
The lord departs, does not return,
Bo’s elder guest lodges.
*(Zhong Fu’s Tong Ren)*

**Kun**
Jade pendants, medicine sachets,
Nothing to tie them with.
Lonely resentment, solitary dwelling,
Sorrowful hours weigh heavy.

**Crafting mulberry, shaping stone.**

**Jing**
A boat laden crosses the sea—
though deep, what blame?
Sun and grandson both remain,
no place is lost.

**Ge**
The dove seeks fish for food,
on the path meets archers’ shafts.
A net tightens round its neck,
cords bind both wings.
To fly yet cannot—
taken by Yi.

**Ding**
Face smeared with mud, hair in disarray,
enduring shame, little grace,
day by day wasting away.

**Zhen**
The mulberry’s square leaves will fall,
their yellow scattered.
Losing power, overturned,
as if no ground to stand on.

A giant serpent, a monstrous eel,
battle in the state’s domain.
Above and below cut off,
the lord flees in flight.

Ji moves, dies—
Lian Shang’s son.
Sand and stones flung,
the Hu’s spears stir chaos.
War drums thunder,
officers and soldiers tremble.

**Guimei**
A net spread to seize the turtledove,
disaster clings to the bird.
Male and female both caught,
destroyed by the snare.
*(Alternate: Two men walk together,
parting to hold food.
One body, five hearts—
chaos, nothing gained.
*(Ben’s Guimei.))*

**Feng**
Three sages aid one another,
birds and beasts dance in joy.
Peaceful, prosperous, abundant,
two in harmonious union.

**Lü**
Three odd, six even,
following together to market.
The prince’s grandson, skilled in trade,
first gains the treasure.
Dwelling unchanged—
great thieves bring blame.

**Xun**
Three walk as one,
one speaks of north,
uncle and elder wish south,
the youngest disagrees.
Midway, paths diverge,
strife and mutual harm.
*(Guimei’s Zhong Fu.)*

**Dui**
Tossing heaven, whirling earth,
disturbing the spirits’ abode.
Dwelling in joy, no blame—
words untrue bring error.

Seated, contending, rising in dispute,
tumultuous, clamorous.
Fortune turns to calamity,
disaster reaches our lord.

**Jie**
The snake slithers, winding,
unable to climb the slope.
Treading with restraint, dwelling in peace—
no cause for worry.

A crack widens, the wall collapses,
termites swarm, the wood snaps.
Wolf and tiger seize power,
Heaven sends down punishment.
Gaojian is slain, Wang Yi dies—
Hu Hai perishes.

**Xiaoguo**
Yang does not violate virtue,
high mountains teem with marshes.
Yanzi chases the hare,
yet gains nothing.

**Jiji**
The heart brims with dread,
ever anxious, daily fearful.
Though small blame arises,
in the end, no great regret.

**Weiji**
The host of spirits gathers,
conferring in counsel.
The southern land oppressed,
its people sorrow and suffer.
An army raised to conquer,
a worthy lord is set apart.

**Fu, Twenty-Fourth Hexagram**

**Fu**
The Zhou army strikes Zhou,
triumphant at Muye.
At dawn on *jiazi*,
all under heaven rejoices.

**Qian**
Renwu, burdened by might,
binds and marches—unsubdued.
Mired in mud, the path lost,
the mighty army routed.

**Kun**
Righteousness yields to desire,
self-serving greed.
Coveting gain, endangering the self—
horns broken, neck crushed.

**Zhun**
A hanging gnomon, white plumb—
food unsuited to the task.
Losing the carriage, the hut stripped,
resting, then moving abode—
what worry for the household?

**Meng**
The crane and crow wed,
deep-eyed, slender-bodied.
Bending the waist without flattery,
turning from the elder.

**Xu**
The east wind melts the ice,
rivers and streams flow free.

**Ximen Zicai**,
elevated for merit.

**Song, Sixth Hexagram**

**Song**
Three feet walk as one,
prone to stumble and fall.
Six fingers bring no ease,
burdening brothers.
A tree as axle blocks the cart,
losing its rightful place.
*(As in Hexagram Xian.)*

**Shi**
Granaries atop the capital,
millet and grain abound.
Swift marches, hasty arrivals—
to sate the hungry throng.

**Bi**
The path to Mount Nan’s south,
where the true man resides.
Virtue matched to Yao and Shun,
heaven’s mandate as son.
Protected and feasted,
his person receives great fortune.
*(As in Hexagram Xie.)*

**Xiao Xu**
Chariots race, men chase,
armor rolled in enmity.
Qi and Lu raid and war,
defeated at Quanqiu.
*(As in Hexagram Dui.)*

**Lü**
Fifteen, betrothed in marriage,
gentle and virtuous.
Frost descends, she weds—
her husband deems it fitting.
At the solstice of the former kings,
no profit in leaving the domain.

**Tai**
Strength weak, capacity slight,
entrusted to a distant state.
Chariot and cheek unsteady,
crippled by paralysis.

**Pi**
An ancient hall of a thousand years,
soon to face hardship.
Shouldering grain, bearing sacks,
they depart due north.

**Tong Ren**
Evil disasters mount,
daily growing clearer.
Calamity beyond remedy,
thrice repelled, thrice wounded.

**Da You**
A crown perilous, laden with woe,
the self startled, ill at ease.
Racing with misfortune,
disaster enters the gate.

**Qian**
Tigers and wolves dwell together,
no service can be rendered.
Loyal plans shift,
disaster must reach the self.
Retreat to the deep mountains,
then the person remains unharmed.

**Yu**
Eggs contend with stone,
the fawn crushed beyond refuge.
A messenger with a jar,
no cause for dread.

**Sui**
Five hearts, six intentions,
forked paths with many guides.
Not the lord’s true will,
it breeds my regret.

**Gu**
Snow and sleet clog the road,
a bound march, a broken cart.
The traveler homeless,
profit in lament alone.

**Lin**
Prizing profit, harming right,
the moon rises over level ground.
The state in chaos, heaven’s norms overturned—
calamity heralds ruin.

**Guan**
A bound march, a broken cart,
stepping into Fan’s home.
The crossbeam door pierced by arrows,
no one to serve as host.
Selling robes to buy food,
husks and chaff leave no fullness.

**Shi He**
Chasing game out the gate,
both lose the jade pellet.
Coming and going at the well,
the meal breaks the cracked basin.

**Bi**
In spring’s first month, sweet wine—
may the lord live long.
Southern mountains brim with fortune,
fit for trade in the market.
Autumn’s beam and hen pheasant,
wherever they go, profit and joy.

**Bo**
Grasping blade, holding meat,
facing wine, not eating.
The husband gone to war,
the eldest son imprisoned,
hugging knees, sleeping alone.

**Yu Wang**
Riding an ox, scorched by heat,
unable to till the field.
Grass and weeds unplowed,
the year yields nothing.

**Da Xu**
The great southern domain,
ghosts and demons fill the halls.
Wailing voices pursue,
becoming thieves against me.

**Yi**
What is spoken, crouching low,
none like my own walls.
Joy and mirth, firm and strong,
can long endure.

**Da Guo**
Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang,
four sages, earnest in benevolence.
Truly spreading virtuous fame,
the people at peace without end.
Travelers gaze toward one another,
not yet sharing court and minister.

**Kan**
Bound and shackled, seized,
the body enters prison.
Shaved by punishment, subject to law,
never to be freed.
Ears blocked, the Way obstructed,
seeking affairs, none succeed.

**Li**
Dwelling with Jie and Jie,
the people distressed and sorrowful.
Travelers move slowly,
lingering in Qi and Lu.

**Cheng**
Seeking fowl, obtaining pheasant,
buying turtle, losing fish.
Goods balanced in exchange,
profit gained without excess.
Qi Jiang and Song Zi,
their marriage greatly joyous.

**Heng**
Two armies, four-horse teams,
the Wind Earl blows the clouds.
Qin and Chu vie in strength,
their influence cannot advance.

**Dun**
Midwinter like autumn,
crows scatter, drinking sorrow.
Stricken by grain shortages,
startled thrice by the osprey.

**Da Zhuang**
Three papers ascend the mountain,
together reaching Yin’s peace.
Proceeding to Nanyang,
preserving its fragrant zhi.
Two cliffs gaze across,
no bed yet prepared.

**Jin**
Flying to the south,
returning to Liaodong.
Male and female follow,
their harmonious cries resounding,
easing my breast’s pounding.

**Ming Yi**
Yao drinks, Shun dances,
Yu bows, offering fine wine.
Abundant rites and music,
one may dwell in peace,
preserving my fair maiden.

**Jia Ren**
Tai Yi sets the wine,
the Music Master begins the dance.
The myriad spirits gather,
one may dwell in peace,
soothing my children’s teeth.

**Kui**
The white horse parts the herd,
unceasing in birth and milk.
Enriching my merchants,
gaining profit in abundance.

**Jian**
The fine horse strides swiftly,
a blind master sits at the reins.
Eyes see no road,
halting midway, not arriving.

**Xie**
Spring peaches sprout,
the myriad things flourish in bloom.
Where the lord resides,
the state rejoices without care.

**Sun**
Pearls held in the mouth,
hoarded as jade treasure.
Obtaining what I possess,
joyfully delighted.

**Yi**
The timid burn graves,
the emaciated stripped by cold and hunger,
afflicted by malaria, frostbite, and cramps.

**Guai**
Water froths, sinking and floating,
dampness lingers, unsettled—
a heart’s illness and sorrow.

**Gou**
Acting like Jie and Zhou,
though prayers are made, none aid.
Fate wanes, the Zhou perish,
Wen Jun lacks descendants.

**Cui**
Clams and snakes wear pots,
unable to ascend the mountain.
Feet crushed, lame and stumbling,
injuring their faces.

**Sheng**
The eldest son imprisoned,
the wife spins, the mother weeps.
Frost descends, the tenth day severe,
toward dusk, the law is enforced.

**Kun**
Seeking a dog, obtaining a hare,
requesting the new, encountering the old.
Though not on the main path,
it adorns my former home.

**Jing**
The crow caws at the reeds’ tip,
one call, three stumbles.
Shaken east and west,
perilous, yet not at peace.

**Divine talismans invoke blessings—**
illness and disease hold no harm.

**Ge**
Heaven rejects Yu’s virtue,
commands rise in Tang’s land.
Beating drums at the altar,
to dispel the people’s afflictions.

**Ding**
Yin mist gathers in concealment,
the white sun unseen.
Devious paths confuse the Way,
the lord is led astray in bewilderment.

**Zhen**
Apes fall from towering trees,
yet hands and feet remain unharmed.
Grasping pearls, embracing jade,
they return to my chamber.
*(As in* Tun *to* Yu*,* Meng *to* Sui.*)*

**Gen**
Three black steeds bear the crossbeam,
southward to gather fragrant orchids.
Autumn thoroughwort, rich and sweet,
fills my caskets and chests,
benefiting my young ginger.

**Jian**
Spring gives birth, nurturing fledglings,
feathers and wings come to form.
Rising without misstep,
lord and minister harmonize.
Thieves flee northward,
yet feel no regret in the end.

**Guimei**
Bound eastward, the cart breaks—
returning home.
Heaven’s decree reaches its end,
no prayers can avert misfortune.

**Feng**
Nine geese array in formation,
the female alone strays.
Dragged by the kidneys,
she dies at the butcher’s hand.

**Lü**
Two men push the cart,
departing from their home.
The well boils, the cauldron wails—
no place to dwell.
*(Variant:* Cong *reads as* Xi.*)*

**Xun**
Blocked paths reopen,
meeting goodness along the way.
The man of sweet pear,
dispels my woes and misfortune.

**Dui**
Taxes levied thick and frequent,
governance preys upon the people.
Shuttles and looms lie empty,
families abandon their homes.

**Huan**
Anger misdirected,
coveting rotten rats.
Calling for magpies and crows,
they lose their own bait,
bringing disaster upon themselves.

**Jie**
Hairpins too short, sashes too long,
the deepest sorrow lies in solitude.
Gaunt and weary,
illness descends.

**Zhongfu**
Three walk together,
each to pluck mulberry leaves.
They gather reeds and bamboo,
leaving behind my fine singers.
Returning without fault,
they come again in the fourth month.

**Xiaoguo**
Chasing the turtledove southward,
joined by joy in flight.
Together they seize fawns,
returning with abundant gain.
Though troubled, no danger arises.

**Jiji**
Driving sheep southward,
they meet with calamity.
Wolves startle my horse,
tigers steal my child—
grief and regret are my own fault.

**Weiji**
Eastern neighbors, western gardens,
fortune and joy shared alike.
Emerging with Sui pearls,
retaining harmonious jade,
both profit and prosper.

---

**Kui**
Eyes meet yet hearts diverge,
truth and falsehood intermingle.
The northern wind grasps hands,
yet at dawn they part—
loss follows close behind.

**Jian**
Bows unstrung, arrows scattered,
the Way of the archer is lost.
The chariot’s axle breaks,
the horse stumbles in the mire—
no path forward remains.

**Jie**
Twisting paths, tangled threads,
the traveler’s steps are bound.
Entering darkness, emerging into light,
the great fire burns bright.
The rooster crows at dawn,
yet the fox lurks in the shadows—
misfortune strikes the unwary.

**Sun**
The river’s flow is dammed,
the ferryman’s pole stands idle.
The servant flees at dusk,
leaving the master bereft.
Though the sun rises,
the field lies barren—
the harvest is lost.

**Bi**
The wild goose soars high,
its wings outstretched in flight.
Yet the net is cast,
the arrow loosed—
the noble bird falls.
Jade shatters, flowers wither,
regret comes too late.

**Gua**
The cart’s wheels sink deep,
the oxen strain in vain.
Two worms coil in the dust,
their paths entwined.
Though harm is near,
the wise remain unshaken—
fortune favors the steadfast.

**Gou**
The aged man draws his bow,
his aim unerring.
The arrow strikes the mark,
the prey lies slain.
Yet the hunter’s joy is fleeting—
the domain of death is vast,
and none escape its bounds.

**Cui**
The mulberry’s leaves are plucked,
the silkworms fed in vain.
The loom stands empty,
the shuttle still.
The weaver’s hands grow idle,
her virtue unspun—
the household fades into silence.

**Sheng**
The tree’s roots run deep,
its branches reach the heavens.
Yet the axe falls,
the saw bites hard—
the towering trunk is felled.
The phoenix flees its perch,
the nest left desolate.

**Yi**
The river’s waters rise,
the dike crumbles beneath.
The traveler’s path is cut,
his journey left unfinished.
Though the sun shines,
the road is lost—
the Way is obscured.

**Ge**
The old skin is shed,
the new form emerges.
The snake sloughs its scales,
the cicada its husk.
Yet the fire burns on,
consuming all in its path—
transformation brings no respite.

Lush and spreading, branches of peach,
tall and flourishing, splendidly blooming.

**Fu:**
Ji and Jiang delight in joy,
the two clans wed.
Frost descends, yet love endures—
Xishi stands before them.

**Wu Wang:**
Wearing a bamboo hat, sleeping alone,
by day not seeing the sun.
Toiling without deception,
long labor brings sorrowful thoughts.

**Da Xu:**
First donning the cap of adulthood,
at twenty, striking the chamber.
Newly wed, joy abounds—
Bo and Ji possess virtue.

**Yi:**
The two solstices at Lingtai,
where the cultured wander and rest.
Clouds and omens all prepared,
enduring joy without care.

**Da Guo:**
Endless rain, ceaseless downpour,
muddy paths, mired travel.
Merchants cease their trade,
the market stands empty.

**Kan:**
The city crumbles, the border is pressed,
repeatedly afflicting Qi.
Invasion unceasing,
lord and minister vexed with worry.
High and low exhausted,
the people lack wealth.

**Li:**
The southern land flourishes,
millet and sweet wine.
One may feast and nourish,
delighting in worthy friends.

**Xian:**
Worry lodges in heart and belly,
inner collapse becomes illness.
Disaster rises within the walls—
the mind governs the state.

**Heng:**
Rotten roots, severed tree,
flowers and leaves fall away.
Suddenly meeting a great crowd,
they topple with the wind.

**Zhu:**
A tree’s shadow serves as altar,
laughing and speaking together.
No meeting at noon,
favor and glory are cast aside.

**Da Zhuang:**
Four legs all run,
the weak nag lags behind.
Twice battling without victory,
defeated by the eastern Chu.

**Jin:**
Holding the reins at court,
returning to the old place.
The wheat blossoms wound the heart—
the uncle has no sorrow.

**Ming Yi:**
Night long, day short,
yin as bandit to yang.
The myriad things wither and empty,
hidden in the northern land.

**Jia Ren:**
The turtledove’s seven chicks,
evenly reared, never endangered.
Grown to maturity,
abandoned yet harmonious.

**Kui:**
Three sheep ascend the mountain,
galloping to the great plain.
The yellow dragon bears the boat,
thus reaching Yi Yang,
exhausting its jade sack.

**Jian:**
Head and feet reversed,
tail and head inverted.

**Gong:**
The lord becomes a crone,
confounding his early wisdom.

**Xie:**
Ascending heights to gaze at home,
toilsome duties never cease.
Royal affairs lack rest—
no leisure for carefree wandering.

**Sun:**
Fearing dusk, he does not proceed,
waiting for dawn to act.
Hunting and burning bring fortune—
the elder relies on this blessing.

**Yi:**
Alone and solitary,
with none to depend on or aid,
his heart labors, his will suffers.

**Ni:**
Mountain stones rot and crumble,
collapsing into ruin.
Above and below, hearts divide—
the lord bears the curse.

**Cui:**
The cultured mother, the sagely son,
boundless in age and longevity,
rule as lords of all under heaven.

**Sheng:**
Stubborn and obstinate in form,
front and rear at odds.
Words like a turtle’s cough—
twisted and unknowable.

**Kun:**
Five dragons leap together,
the strong are routed in defeat.
My sprouts and crops exposed—
the year yields great abundance.

**Jing:**
Thunder dispels the fierce and swift,
yet healing proves difficult.
The steed exhausted by the salt cart,
ensnared by bit and whip.

**Ge:**
In the southlands, locusts swarm,
stinging my hands and feet.
Grievances twist and coil—
pain pierces heart and belly.

**Ding:**
The heart has no foothold,
shooting the deer but missing.
Much speech, little substance—
words accomplish nothing.

**Zhen:**
The lord is enlightened, his ministers virtuous,
calling out to seek their kin.
A governance of manifest power—
thus may one tread the earth.

**Gen:**
At peace in the land, fit for office,
promoted nine times in a day.
Surpassing all peers,
he tends and nurtures Mount Chang.

**Jian:**
Preserving words, resolving grievances,
cleansing away filth and defilement.
What once bred calamity
is now purged of cruelty and harm.

**Guimei:**
The old man raves, the crone is blind,
dragging each other northward.
Longing to return to the lofty city,
yet lost and bewildered.

**Feng:**
Drunk by the roadside,
delirious and sightless,
unfit for my life.

**Lü:**
Northward to Ghost Mound,
riding a dragon on an eastern journey.
The Queen Mother follows behind—
what worry for the civil and martial?

**Xun:**
Serene and untroubled,
playing at the Dao’s gate.
Consorting with spirits,
ever joyful and at peace.

**Dui:**
Exchanging hemp for silk,
clutching cloth to offer oneself.
Discarding rites, growing idle—
in the end, regret and sorrow.

**Huan:**
Adorned in robes and cap,
playing at the Dao’s gate.
Ending with propriety,
the body knows no disaster.

**Jie:**
Heaven’s marsh becomes dry land,
the shore turns to sea’s edge.
The noble one strays from his path—
the petty cling together.

**Zhongfu:**
The deep spring overflows,
a curse upon the town.

**Roads blocked, impassable—**
the child’s heart seethes with indignation.

**Xiaoguo:**
Ten li gazing at smoke,
scattered and dissolved in four directions.
Form and body perish—
one may plunge into the abyss,
yet never see their lord.

**Jiji:**
Rumors mislead,
no fine path to follow.
Beating drums to chase the wolf,
yet unaware how near it lurks.

**Weiji:**
Eastward, the great pearl is lost;
westward, cowardice is cast aside.
Times are often inauspicious,
leaving me to lag behind.

spirits and men lend aid.
Virtue’s teaching dispels harm,

receiving abundant blessings.

Qi and Zhou at the sea’s edge,
solitude brings joy, no sorrow.
A place to evade disaster,
preserving life and wealth.

Alone and solitary,
no one to rely upon,
the heart labors, the will suffers.

the mind ever seeks escape.

the tripod’s decree arrives.
Wiping the goblet, cleansing the vessels,
cooking food in anticipation—
no cause for the youngest’s sorrow.

Dwelling on high ground, scarce springs,
mountains without clouds.
A thousand *li* journey,
mud soils your wheels—
a trouble for me as well.

blood splatters, stench fills the air.
The spirits turn away, looking west,
the mandate of declining Zhou ends.

The axle hub secure within,
what fault befalls the noble one?

Ten sons, nine wives,
none fit to dwell with.
A steadfast heart unexpressed,
to this day the name stands alone.

**Yi**
The carriage rolls through rice and wheat,
arriving at home and kingdom.
The joyous land free from disaster,
what worry has the noble one?

**Da Guo**
Building a chamber at the mountain’s root,
meant for security and peace.
One night it collapses from the peak,
shattering my treasured meal.

**Kan**
Six men travel together,
each losing their sack.
The yellow crane drops its pearl,
nothing left to illuminate.

The eastern sea’s distant shores,
where fortune and blessings reside.
Gentle and refined, proper in ritual,
what fault lies with the Nine Yi?

**Jian**
Yang spring gives birth and growth,
all things flourish and thrive.
Late autumn spreads its leaves,
the noble one emulates its virtue.

Lowering the head, stealing glances,
fearing to be seen.
Actions bring misfortune,
wine sours, fish spoils,
none dare to indulge.

**Xian** | At dawn, the wise assist the king—Zhou’s virtue shines brightly. Yue Shang presents pheasants; the myriad states know peace.
*(Zhou Gong Dan, Shao Gong Shi.)*

**Heng** | Weak feet, severed heels—no profit in going out. Trade brings no gain; loss and ruin follow.

**Dun** | Hard ice, yellow birds, ever wailing in sorrow. No sweet grain is seen—only flowering mugwort. Startled again and again by crows, my heart is filled with care.
*(See *Qian* → *Shi He*, *Yi* → *Da Guo*.)*

**Da Zhuang** | The soul fades, faint and trembling; the thread of weaving is cut. Suddenly, all becomes clear—I live again.

**Jin** | Yin gives birth to the deer in Kang Valley; mice dance in Ghost Gorge. The sacred tortoise dwells on land; the cauldron’s rice is mixed with dirt. The people foresee the state’s ruin—Jie’s chaos knows no order.

**Ming Yi** | Gathering stones to carve jade, none remain uncut. I raise the dragon’s form; Lu Ban is my aid. The qilin and phoenix take shape—their virtue mirrors the noble one.

**Jia Ren** | Mountains shift to become the sky; dry land turns to sea’s mouth. The people cannot rest in peace.

**Kui** | The east wind opens the door; hidden, I fear yet rejoice. The sprouts receive favor—I regain my child.

**Jian** | A hundred branches of flowering lamps, planted in darkness, wane and dim. Their radiance nearly spent, they fade like ash or dust.

**Xie** | Thirty and still unwed, I lodge in the mulberry grove. The eldest daughter of the upper palace—no shared joy is ours.

**Sun** | The egg battles the stone; surely, it shatters. Toiling brings regret—no timely exit is found.

**Yi** | Qin’s armies contend in strength, losing their integrity and goodness. They defeat my homeland of Ban.

**Guai** | The cruel remove the good and suspect the loyal—difficult to cure. The thoroughbred, trapped in a washbasin cart, is tormented by bit and whip.

**Jian** | Grasping a bamboo shoot to strike the fox, shouldering a bow to shoot the fish.

Not its proper vessel or use—it wearies the heart of its own accord.

**Cui** | The covenant at Kuiqiu, tribute offered in Jin’s court. Seeing the Grand Steward’s plea, the chariot is turned back.

**Sheng** | Sun Bin deceives Pang Juan, carving words on wood to feign favor. The ambush is sprung at last—arrows fall like rain. The Wei army panics in chaos; its general is taken captive.

**Kun** | Journeying south beyond the city, the world gains great fortune. The royal princess returns to Qi, her desires fulfilled, bringing peace to the state.

**Jing** | Winter gathers fern and orchid, the earth frozen hard. Though one flees in haste, by dusk nothing is gained.

**Ge** | Wang Qiao is free of illness, yet the dog’s head aches not. Sandals lost, shoes misplaced—I lack those to send me off.

**Ding** | The swift-footed horse races blindly, guided by a sightless master. Eyes see no path; by midnight, they fail to arrive.

**Zhen** | Seeking profit in a troubled land, I flee northward. Anxious, I return to my city—only to become its foe.

**Jian** | The four-winged paired fish bring peace to my state. Above and below, no peril—this is my blessed fortune.

**Guimei** | The eight talents ascend, accomplishing great deeds. The dragon descends to the palace courtyard; the land knows no disaster.

**Feng** | The thatch wears thin, holes gaping—no one upholds the ancestral home. Servants and maids flee; son west, father east—calamity befalls the self.

**Lü** | Crows dance over the city walls, the town trembles in sudden fear. Virtue unnurtured, it is overthrown by those below.

**Xun** | The five grains fail to ripen; the people suffer hardship and distress. Driving southward, joy and gain are found.

**Dui** | Yellow robes establish the era; virtue and power reside within. Blessings overflow, enfeoffed as lord of Qi. The market knows no gate—wealth and honor abound.

**Gua** | Qi binds the thatch of Guo’s hut, marrying into the Luo capital. Fine and fair, the profit is ten thousandfold.

**Jie** | A bed of comfort, thick quilts—yet one cannot stay long. Forsaking my joyous feast, I am stranded in the southern land. The worry of casting the shuttle—no true disaster comes.

**Zhongfu** | The inner collapses, the body harmed; chaos within, no constancy. Though fine grain abounds, none may eat it.

**Xiaoguo** | Stepping out, I meet misfortune—enmity with disaster. Another bears a sharp blade; my fingertip is wounded.

**Jiji** | Moving in and out with timely measure, no cares in south or north. The traveler arrives at once; those abroad return home.

**Weiji** | The duke’s grandson drives the chariot, touring eastward to Qi. Yanling praises the estate, leaving Ji with stored robes.

**Yu** | Abundance within does not cease, yet in decline and old age, clumsiness returns. Fullness and excess bring loss; sores fester while the gall grows fat. Zheng Zhao lost his state, while Chong’er rose to power.

**Da Zhuang** | The virtue of festive celebration does not tread in chaotic lands. Though dimmed and without luster, the people receive great fortune.

**Jin** | Driving sheep southward, I encounter misfortune. Wolves startle my horse; tigers steal my child—grief and regret, self-blame.

**Jiaren** | The root not firm, blossoms and leaves fall away, leaving only a solitary widow.

**Kui** | Setting nets to catch fish, instead I snare a pig. Yuan’s loyalty exhausted, the Wu clan is annihilated.

**Jian** | Swift and agile, like an ape leaping through trees. Though the vermilion bow is tuned, in the end, nothing is caught.

**Xie** | Donning cap and sash, journeying south, I meet fortune as promised. Welcomed in a blessed land, I am granted rank and seize the moment.

**Sun** | A year of abundance, harvests ripe, governance benevolent, the people joyful. Entering office, I gain fortune.

**Yi** | Building towers on rocky peaks, foundations laid by water’s source. Illness lingers, unwell; old and solitary, without neighbors.

**Guai** | Chasing the fox eastward to the mountain, water blocks my path. Too deep to ford—I lose advantage and return.

A hungry hawk strikes suddenly—
Two brothers lost.
*Great Exceeding*

**Dà Guò**
Sighing, displeased,
Worry wells from within.
My golden jar is lost,
Without Illusion forfeits its place.
*Abysmal*

**Kǎn**
Firm and yielding call to each other,
Two clans become one household.
Frost descends, they unite—
Bestowing kindness upon me.
*Dwelling People to Decrease, Gradual to Separation.*

**Lí**
Escorting my youngest daughter
To the swaying path.
Qí’s daughter, day and night,
Lingers long in delay.
*Mutual Influence*

**Xián**
Lowering my gaze, stealing glances,
Fearful of being seen.
My actions bring misfortune—
Wine turns sour, fish spoil,
None desire them.
*Cauldron to Release.*

**Dá**
Canonical texts and legal writings,
Stored in Orchid Terrace.
Though turmoil erupts,
Alone they escape disaster.
*Ground to Friend’s Decay, Kun to Great Gain, Great Possession to Dá.*

**Yóu**
Drunk at dawn, sick with wine,
By dusk, restored—
Alone, no blame follows.
*Great Strength*

**Dà Zhuàng**
Painting a dragon’s head and neck,
The pattern remains unfinished.
Sweet words, fair speech,
Persuasions lack substance.
*Rising to Youthful Ignorance, Youthful Ignorance to Biting Through, Dwelling People to Adorning.*

**Jìn**
Sun and moon in motion,
One cold, one heat.
Radiant glory blazes bright—
Yet cannot be preserved.
Stumbling, falling, cast down,
Reduced to common rank.
*Xùn to Zhèn.*

**Míng Yí**
Contending for profit in the royal market,
The court abounds with noble men.
The six states of Sū,
Gain their splendor and favor.

**Jiā Rén**
Six serpents dart and flee,
All into dense grass.
Startled on the long road,
Dreading the pecking beak.
*Jǐng to Duì, Fēng to Xùn.*

**Kuí**
Hanging fox, idle meal,
Eating what it does not earn.
Losing its carriage, stripped of its wheels,
It rests, then moves its seat.
*Yí to Yì.*

**Jiǎn**
Nine joyful children,
All meet with great delight.
Carrying blessings in hand,
The king’s grandson grows rich.

**Jiě**
Bó Yí and Shū Qí,
Paragons of integrity and purity.
With virtue they ward off calamity—
Worry and misfortune do not arise.
*Gé to Pǐ, Guī Mèi to Lín, Jié to Yì.*

**Sǔn**
A mighty sage hides his name,
Men conceal the startled qilin.
The phoenix flees north in flight,
Chaos unchecked, unrest unceasing.
*Pǐ to Dà Guò, Bō to Lín.*

**Yì**
Long widowed, without a mate,
He seeks a woman to know.
Pursuing what is not his desire,
He dooms himself to solitude.

**Yāng**
A siege of ruin,
Heaven does not bless.
Hard to halt or still.

**Shēn**
The old, slothful, and covetous,
Corrupt governance as thieves.
Ē Páng and Lí Shān,
Zǐ Yīng loses his state.

**Cuì**
Three offerings, six omens,
Following one another in turn.
Bewildered, they enter the empty marsh,
Crossing the tiger’s den.
Wounded and harmed,
They die in its jaws and belly.

**Shēng**
Whispering in the glare,
Groping in darkness, locked in struggle.
Much talk, little substance,
Words accomplish nothing.
*Míng Yí to Yù, Qiān to Qián.*

**Kùn**
Wǔ Yáng and Jiàn Lí,
Striking the zither, singing well.
Admiring Dān’s righteousness,
They aid Yān and Kē.
The plot fails in secret,
Huo’s eyes meet death—
What use is their fame?

**Jǐng**
Yǐn Shì and Bó Qí,
Father and son torn apart.
Innocent yet condemned,
A long tongue brings disaster.

**Gé**
Five essences in chaos,
Governance defies the emperor’s grace.
Tāng and Wǔ blaze in wrath,
Together they strike our land.

**Dǐng**
Westward to Jade Mountain,
Eastward through Jade Gate.
Ascending the hall of fortune,
Drinking the wine of ten thousand years.

**Zhèn**
Acting against taboos,
Offending the Controller of Fate.
Seized, bound, and restrained,
Held fast by the officers—
Yet the lost man finds joy.
*Bō.*

**Gèn**
A father unworthy,
The court teems with slanderers.
The lord loses his rule,
I remain long in poverty.

**Jiàn**
Three men journey together,
Seeking great omens in the north.
The eldest’s foot is ailing,
The youngest bears the load.
The steadfastness of Liǔ Xià—
Our state is not lost.

**Guī Mèi**
The crane longs for its mate,
Wishing to follow the phoenix east.
Following the pattern of feathers and wings,
It emerges at noon.
Though lingering in the northern town,
It returns to its chamber.
*Yì to Guān, Xū to Lí, Fēng to Tài.*

**Fēng**
Virtue constant and true,
No misfortune or disaster befalls.
As ever.

**Lǚ**
The white magpie soars and gazes,
The noble one finds peace.
Treading virtue without fault,
Fortune and blessings come to fruition.

**Xùn**
Virtue of keen perception,
Striving, forgetting to eat.
Capturing leopards and tigers,
Bringing the king good fortune.
*Dà Yǒu to Kùn.*

**Duì**
A hundred legs move as one,
Strength in mutual support.
Three sages assist the cause,
The royal house shines in favor,
The state prospers, the people thrive.
*Tún to Lǚ.*

**Huàn**
Born out of time,
Beset by hardship and woe.
Aged, worn, and frail,
The heart grieves in sorrow.

**Jié**
Leaving the gate, stumbling,
Looking back at the road behind.
The sheep bought has fled,
The goods taken have escaped.
Empty-handed, clenching fists,
Sitting in regret and blame.

**Xiǎo Guò**
Tending sheep in the rice fields,
Hearing the tiger’s roar.
Fearful, trembling, holding breath—
Yet in the end, no disaster.
*Suí to Jiàn, Jǐng to Pǐ, Bō to Sǔn.*

**Jì Jì**
The dragon lurks in the phoenix pond,
Jī Zǐ changes his garb,
Dark treachery begins to sprout.

**Wèi Jì**
No neighboring state to compare,
All vie for strength.
Chaos and strife,
The world in turmoil.

**Xiǎo Guò**
Though first alarmed and frightened,
Afterward unharmed.
Receiving its blessings,
Everlasting good fortune.

**Qián**
Accumulating virtue and benevolence,
Divine aid and trust follow,
Fortune grows day by day.

**Kūn**
Cautious in speech,
Though misfortune strikes,
Zhōu and Shào recount their duties,
Escaping the prison gate.

**Tún**
Birds take flight, flapping wings,
Rejoicing in Yáo’s virtue.
Yú and Xià record their deeds,
The distant lands submit in tribute.

**Méng**
Teeth sprout from gums,
The hall’s doors open wide.
The secluded one finds advantage in constancy,
Flapping wings, rising in dance.

**Xū**
Sending the elder east to seek,
He refuses to go.
Quarreling with his younger brother,
They slander and wound each other.

**Sòng**
Hands and feet reversed,
Head and tail inverted.
The lord becomes a woman,
Confusing early understanding.

**Shī**
The craftsman wields his axe,
The camphor tree in peril.
The robe stripped away,
His office and life end.

**Bǐ**
The Heavenly Maiden squats on the bed,
No pattern is formed.
Southern Dipper lacks a tongue,
The rice is full of grit and husks.
Oppressing the masses, stealing fame,
Male and female break their necks.
*Dà Xù to Yì.*

**Xiǎo Xù**
The great mallet shatters the wheel,
A long tongue disrupts the state.
Words like thorns and brambles—
Three generations know no peace.

**Lǚ**
Accepting the mandate, bearing humiliation,
Unable to fulfill the task.

Amidst the fall, burdened anew.

**Tài**
Three serpents share a chamber,
Kin finding kin.
Sweet dew descends in season,
Nurturing our hundred grains.

**Pǐ**
Adorned in brocade, roaming by night,
Encountering you, my lord.
Removing harm, dispelling doubt,
Freeing you from care.

**Tóng Rén**
Hair unbound, beastly heart—
Hard to dwell beside.
Arriving like wind and rain,
Departing like a snapped string,
Devoured by wolves.

**Dà Yǒu**
Hard and soft call to each other,
Two clans become one household.
With frost’s descent, they unite,
Bestowing kindness through virtue.
*Jiā Rén to Sǔn, Zhōng Fú to Kǎn, Jiàn to Lí.*

**Qiān**
Ox ears, dragon’s snort—
Deaf to sound and taste.
Entrusted with the cauldron’s charge,
Yet chaos reigns, befuddled.

**Yù**
Head bowed, eyes averted,
Fearful of being seen.
Travel brings no profit—
Wine sours, fish spoil,
None dare to partake.
*Dǐng to Xiè.*

**Suí**
The Rain Master weds his bride,
Huángyán’s youngest son.
Rites completed, marriage sealed,
They call each other southward.
Enriching the earth below,
The year yields great abundance.
*Pǐ to Kūn, Héng to Jìn, Fēng to Bǐ, Fēng to Dà, Guò.*

**Gǔ**
Wearing a basin, gazing at heaven—
Stars remain unseen.
Fixating on trifles, losing the grand,
Fleeing beyond the wall.
*Bì to Méng, Xùn to Jiàn, Yì to Zhōng Fú.*

**Lín**
Two ride the carriage,
Moving their household away.
The well boils, the cauldron wails—
No place to dwell.

**Guān**
Arms flailing, elbows turned,
Rage unstoppable.
A wolf’s heart, treacherous core—
None dare trade with him.

**Shì Kè**
From fire and scalding woe,
Joy arrives in turn.

**Bì**
Loyalty and trust lend aid,
The king’s rule stands firm.
Gōngliú lays the foundation,
Wén and Wǔ bring peace.

**Bō**
Climbing high, breaking branches,
Stumbling into peril.
Cart overturned, horses spent,
Uncles sigh in distress.

**Fù**
The mulberry withers and falls,
Yellow leaves scatter.
Losing power, teetering,
As if no ground remains.

**Wú Wàng**
Phoenixes soar and wheel,
Gathering in state and home.
Thinking of my elder sister,
Reunited with our mother.

**Dà Xù**
Yin’s excess lingers,
Overflowing past measure,
Damaging the harvest.

**Yí**
Towering peaks, perilous paths—
The king’s grandson exhausted,
Stranded on the slope.

**Dà Guò**
Harmonious jade, gleaming pearls,
Consumed by fire.
Darkness blinds, light stolen,
Vital essence lost—
Discarded by the roadside.

**Kǎn**
The lord of Yú reveres the spirits,
Blessing my aged kin.
Reverently serving the ancestral shrine,
Though displeased, he does not leave,
Restoring my inner duties.

**Lí**
Warriors of claw and fang,
Resentful, curse their father.
Shifting woe to themselves—
No harm befalls their mother.
*Qiān to Guī Mèi.*

**Xián**
Granaries overflow, stores in the millions,
Fit for planting millet and grain—
The year brings growth.

**Héng**
Windows and doors stand open,
Brightness and clarity flow.
Wise counsel aids the sage,
Virtue spreads far.
Households prosper, people thrive,
The land flourishes.
*Dà Xù to Shēng.*

**Guàng**
Looming peril,
Misfortune heaped upon woe—
Devoured by the tiger.

**Dà Zhuàng**
Waters devoid of fish,
Land becomes sea’s edge.
The noble lose their place,
The lowly cling together.

**Jìn**
Jiǔyí’s misty forests,
Damp and unfit.
Loathed by phoenixes,
The noble depart.
*Wú Wàng to Xùn.*

**Míng Yí**
Six wings scatter in flight,
Returning too late.
Escaping to the royal house,
Losing their leader.

**Jiā Rén**
Not as upright as Duke Zhuāng,
Contending with me in dispute.
The matchmaker lacks propriety,
Bringing obstruction upon himself.

**Kuí**
Granaries overflow with grain,
The Duke of Sòng in peril.
The son of Hào perishes at the gate,
Losing his life and place.

**Jiǎn**
Losing the sheep, seizing the ox—
No loss, no worry.

**Xiè**
Summer wheat, coarse and wild,
Frost strikes its awns.
A sickly lord ruins the state,
Forcing me to kill and grieve.
*Tài to Zé.*

**Sǔn**
Dim and dark,
Unsure of black from white.
Wind and rain bring chaos,
Light hides, vanishing—
King Yōu loses his realm.

**Yì**
Wielding the axe, splitting kindling,
Sending the matchmaker to seek a bride.
Two clans unite,
Parents and in-laws drink together.
Fair as fur and walls,
The elders rejoice.

**Guài**
Six illnesses breed madness,
Foolish wandering, reckless acts.
Northward through the gate of woe,
Neighboring disaster.

**Shēn**
Driving sheep to the flock,
The ram refuses to advance.
Qìng Jì rejects counsel,
Bringing calamity upon his son.

**Cuì**
Two take different paths,
Rushing westward.
Beyond ten li,
They know not each other’s whereabouts.

**Shēng**
Duty yields to desire,
Self-serving greed.
Eyes fixed on gain,
Horns break, necks snap.

**Kùn**
Restless, disturbed,
Unsettled in bearing.
Illness in neck and nape—
Peril and woe loom.

**Jǐng**
Three rivers converge,
Waters surge in fury.
The royal house collapses,
The people starve.

**Gé**
Scorching sun, drought’s blight,
Damaging the harvest—
Farmers go hungry.

**Dǐng**
Floating, they leave to eat,
Bearing offerings home.
Reins loosed, horses tethered,
Beneath the southwest hemp.

**Zhèn**
A dwelling by the gate,
A place to rest one’s stay.
The scholar advances without peril,
Secure and joyful, they preserve each other.

**Gèn**
Beyond the hour, he does not return,
Male and female grieve in sorrow.
Roaming a foreign land,
Parted from his mother.
*(See* Jiān *and* Yù’s *Dà Zhuàng.)*

**Jiàn**
Fields hold a hut,
Borders bear melons.
Offered to the august ancestors,
The great-grandson enjoys long life.

**Guī Mèi**
Missing the time, bereft of friends,
The household collapses, he flees—
What use is a lost dog?

**Fēng**
A crooked nose, a forked path,
Three widows dwell alone.

**Lǚ**
Clothes worn inside out,
Summoned by the king.
Achieving Zhou’s completion,
He is enfeoffed and receives great fortune.

**Xùn**
It flies not far,
Returning to its former place.
In affairs, much regret.

**Duì**
A bloodied fleeing bird,
Deaf to the five notes.
Pa and Ba pluck the zither,
Yet the heart finds no delight.

**Huàn**
Seeking jade, he finds stone,
Not what the heart desires.
Prayers and wishes go unfulfilled.

**Jié**
Mountains collapse, valleys sever,
Great fortune comes to an end.
The Jing and Wei lose their order,
Jade and stone are already *(so)*.

**Zhōng Fú**
Mixed eyes, fear, and anger,
No peace in their dwelling.
Treasuries scattered and dispersed,
No profit to be gained.

**Jì Jì**
Crowds of evil fill the sides,
The phoenix’s wings are broken.
The Viscount of Wei returns north,
Leaving his state.

**Wèi Jì**
In the sixth month, one gathers *ba*,
Marching to punish the lawless.
Zhang Zhong and Ji Shu,
Filial and fraternal, drink wine.
*(See* Lí *and* Kǎn. *Jì Jì’s* sixty-third.)

**Jì Jì**
A black hare on the palm,
Gazing at the feet.
Cross-examined and interrogated,
False accusations prove self-vindicating.
Deathly slander is hard to refute—
The mouth brings disaster upon the body.

**Qián**
A colt roams the Stone Gate,
Green-Ears returns safely.
Receiving fortune from the western neighbor,
He retires to Jade Spring.

**Kūn**
In the yang spring, grasses grow,
All things flourish abundantly.
Where the noble one dwells,
Misfortune and calamity do not reach.

**Zhūn Rén**
Without feet, yet following the law,
The sacrificial ox is led out.
The male flees, the sheep startles,
Yet the household remains unlost.

**Méng**
The Great Mountain rushes upward,
Transforming to appear in the Grand Tenuity.
Chen Hao’s neglect and haste
Bring about disaster.

**Xū**
Riding a dragon, it spits forth light,
First dark, then bright.
A great hunt yields much—
The six armies prosper.

**Sòng**
A ram’s head, a hare’s feet,
Emaciated, with little flesh.
A leaking sack stores grain,
No profit is to be gained.
*(See* Huàn’s *Gèn, Bō’s* Héng.*)*

**Shī**
Through misfortune, fortune is received,
Joy fills the chamber.
No locusts arise,
The lord suffers no vexing delusions.

**Bǐ**
Shun ascends, Great Yu,
In the wilds of Stone Yi.
Marching to the king’s gate,
They are charged with governing water and earth.
*(See* Qián’s *Zhōng Fú, Yù’s* Xiǎo Chù, *Duì’s* Cuì.*)*

**Xiǎo Chù**
Crow chicks and magpie fledglings
Always dwell with their mother.
Of a kind, they gather in flocks,
Never leaving their nest.

**Lǚ**
Yi shoots where the land is level,
Every shot finds its mark.
Adding to the granary’s hawks,
Two crows are both taken.

**Tài**
The zhen-bird’s patterned wings,
Soaring high to seek warmth.
Passing blindly through our town,
Yi gains nothing.

**Xiǎo Chù’s Gé, Dà Guò’s Yù, Dà Zhuàng’s Zhèn.**

**Pǐ**
Six joys, three fortunes,
Southward to the land of delight.
With joy they share in mirth,
Praising my pure virtue.

**Tóng Rén**
Fighting dragons break their thighs,
The sun thus fails to shine.
From without they seize control,
The younger brother strikes his elder.

**Dà Yǒu**
Veiled in blessing, receiving fortune,
There is gain to be had—
No advantage in venturing beyond the realm.

**Qiān**
Barbarians and tribes of the wilds,
Gathered where the Great Yin prevails.
The waters freeze in bitter cold,
The noble man does not endure.

**Yù**
Fearing darkness, they lurk in hiding,
Awaiting the hour of brightness.
At last they meet the white sun,
Becoming lords of glory and rank.

**Suí**
Waters flow downward,
Seeking the Eastern Sea.
They seek what I possess,
To buy sturgeon and carp.

*(See* Zhèn’s *Pǐ, Sǔn’s* Xū, *Yì’s* Wú Wàng.*)*

**Gǔ**
Donning cap and sash, he journeys south,
To meet with fortune and joy.
Bound for a land of splendor,
Freed to encounter the times.

**Lín**
The shama thrush shakes its wings,
Becoming the gatekeeper for the youngest son.
Freshly bathed, he dusts his cap—
The elder father rejoices.

**Guān**
Entangled in flowing waters, drowned in slander,
Bound fast by calumny.
Zhou and Shao fulfill their duties,
Their persons receive great fortune.

**Shì Kè**
Field mice and wild quails,
Ever eager to flee.
Confined in cages and pens,
They cannot stir or sway.

*(See* Yāng’s *Qiān, Xū’s* Suí, *Xùn’s* Suí.*)*

**Bì**
Dwelling on Mount Hua’s peak,
Wandering to watch the floating clouds.
Though rain falls, it does not soak—
The heart delights, free of care.

**Bō**
Leaning perilously, about to fall,
Chaos cannot be sustained.
Heroes take up their work,
Yet the house languishes without end.

**Fù**
The heart’s desire is fulfilled,
Now at last the time is met.
Preserving my gains and fortune,
Unseparated from arms and armor.

*(See* Duì’s *Jiǎn.*)*

**Wú Wàng**
The sacred tortoise dwells on land,
Hesitating, losing its place.
Yi Yin retreats to plow,
Later enfeoffed in Xia.

**Dà Xù**
West of the Weak Waters,
There is the Queen Mother of the West.
Born without knowing age,
She abides with Heaven,
No profit in travel.

**Yí**
Clutching jade, seeking gold,
Sitting in lament as dusk falls.
Through life’s end and the year’s close,
No success is achieved.

**Dà Guò**
Laughter and words not yet finished,
Sudden grief strikes like a storm.
The body is bound in fetters,
Beaten, shackled, and bound.

**Kǎn**
Hoping for favor, it does not come,
The literary work remains unfinished.
The prince pursues the hare,
The hound stumbles and fails.

*(See* Wèi Jì’s *Duì, Huàn.*)*

**Lí**
Trembling in fear,
Beset by dread and caution.
The road is fraught with obstacles,
One cannot take a step.

**Xián**
The male fox slinks slowly,
Ascending the rugged mountain.
Proclaiming his manifest merit,
Great fortune truly arises.

**Héng**
Fire rises behind me,
Gladness roasts my offering.
The Azure Dragon holds water,
Scooping it to moisten my pillar—
Though troubled, there is no misfortune.

**Gòu**
Sitting in peril until dusk,
Requests go unanswered.
Sweet rains do not descend,
Governance turns harsh, the people turn fierce.

*(See* Bō’s *Yí, Xū’s* Yí, *Jiàn’s* Kǎn.*)*

**Dà Zhuàng**
In early spring, the harmonious qi,
The hawk seizes the osprey,
The flock of sparrows trembles in fear.

**Jìn**
Lax laws foster long-standing treachery,
Injustice cannot be redressed.
Drowning in wine, losing restraint,
The lord suffers the consequences.

**Míng Yí**
Fish and turtles greedy for bait,
Die in nets and hooks.
Endangered by favor,
They bring calamity upon themselves.

**Jiā Rén**
The golden essence flares in anger,
Sword at his side past noon.
Wandering the high plains,
Lodging in the mountain valleys.
Two tigers face each other,
Bows and arrows fill the field.

*(See* Zhèn’s *Yù.*)*

**Kuí**
Four eyes meet in gaze,
Their essences close, their light shared,
Sitting together, they play the flute.

**Jiǎn**
Eating magic mushrooms and yellow elixir,
Drinking wine and jade nectar.
Communing with the spirits,
Ever free of woe and misfortune.

**Xiè**
Seeking the fine land of the roebuck,
The venomous serpent does not appear.
Returning from Bīn’s Qi mouth,
Back to his own bed.

**Sǔn**
The gates of Heaven and Earth,
Dark and unseen—
One knows not where they are.

**Yì**
The lame man rests his shoulder,
Hesitant, wary of difficulty.
A city of iron walls, bronze gates,
Barriers and screens stand guard—
Peaceful rest, no peril.

*(See* Lǚ’s *Yùn.*)*

**Yāng**
Three wild geese fly together,
Longing to return to the rice ponds.
Crossing mountains and marshes,
They are struck by arrows.

**Shēn**
The ford runs deep, hard to cross,
Soaking my robes in vain.
The prince plies his oars well—
No mishap shall befall.

**Cuì**
Drunk and sated with wine,
They leap and scuffle, fighting.
The elder is wounded, the younger falls—
The family prepares the funeral.
*(See* Bǐ’s *Dǐng*, *Dà Xù*’s *Jìn*, *Yì*’s *Méng.*)*

**Shēng**
Lame and stumbling, he cannot rise,
Losing profit at the late market.
Disaster and misfortune befall him—
He fails to gain the fawn.

**Kùn**
The celestial station descends to *Jiànglóu*,
The *Jiàn* star stands at the center.
Let the child not journey far—
Abroad, he stumbles and falls,
Meeting his end in the end.

**Jǐng**
The merchant’s wind summons bandits,
Who call forth foreign thieves.
Plotting with an inside ally,
They fight against me.
They seize my maidservant’s treasures—
The master cannot prevail.

**Gé**
Sweet dew and sweet springs,
The mechanisms of Great Peace.
Virtue’s resonance moves all—
The year is joyous, the people at ease.

**Dǐng**
*Jì Zhòngzǐ* bursts in,
Forcing the gate in haste.
Disaster arises, the son is wounded—
The younger brother attacks his elder,
And *Zhèng* languishes long in decline.

**Zhèn**
Rebellious steps falter,
Lagging behind, they cannot reach shelter.
Sleeping exposed in the marsh’s shallows,
They lose their fine robes.

**Gèn**
Wolves and tigers conspire,
Gathering to form a stronghold.
They lie in wait for oxen and sheep,
Bringing ruin to my merchants.

**Jiàn**
Illustrious virtue, keen and capable—
*Chónghuá* is recommended for office.
The merit of *Fàngxūn* is employed,
The Eight Sages receive protection.

**Guī Mèi**
A wretched ghost guards the gate,
Shattering my pots each day.
Breaking jars and smashing urns,
Empty and childless.
*(See* Sǔn’s *Bō.*)*

**Fēng**
Heaven’s mandate descends with the red crow,
Marking the time for military might.
Marching to punish the lawless,
*Jīzǐ* roams free.

**Lǚ**
Bound and imprisoned by force,
Falsely accused by others.
*Gāoyáo* judges fairly,
Breaking the shackles to free him—
He returns home unharmed.

**Xùn**
Sheep startle at tigers and wolves,
Ears pricked, they huddle in fear.
No strength avails against might—
They are torn by fangs.

**Duì**
Though first they weep and wail,
Afterward, they rejoice and laugh.
Radiance shines forth—
A hundred blessings align.

**Huàn**
The horse’s legs are long,
Well-suited for good trade.
Blessed by fortune, paired in harmony,
He gains fivefold gold.

**Jié**
The inner gate collapses,
The worthy are slain, the violent killed.
High and low alike rebel—
*Jǐnggōng* loses his throne.
Ever wandering, no home—
His wife does not return.

**Zhōng Fú**
Wielding an axe to split kindling,
He sends a matchmaker to seek a bride.
The two families unite in joy—
The bride’s kin pours the wine.
Fair as fur and fine as silk,
The mother-in-law delights, the father-in-law rejoices.
*(See* Xiǎo Guò’s *Yì.*)*

**Xiǎo Guò**
Two wheels turn with the sun,
Ascending the southern slope.
Four horses share the yoke—
No peril or hardship,
Laughing with *Yǔ* as they go.
*(See* Bì’s *Xū.*)*

**Wèi Jì**
A thousand pillars, a hundred beams—
Yet the hall never tilts or falls,
And the *Zhōu* house enjoys peace.

**Wèi Jì**
Slothful and unprepared,
With weak wine and meager jerky.
Approaching the spirits’ altar,
Seeking his desire,
He reaps great misfortune instead.

**Qián**
Born at dawn, dead by dusk—
Called the infant ghost,
Unfit for sacrifice.
*(See* Huàn’s *Dà Guò*, *Zhèn*’s *Kūn*, *Xiǎo Xù*’s *Shēng.*)*

**Kūn**
Striding boldly into the carriage,
Southward to the house of joy.

They gift me a fox-fur robe,
And fortune and joy arrive.
*(See* Jié’s *Guān*, *Dà Guò*’s *Kùn*, *Zhōng Fú*’s *Tài.*)*

**Tún**
In the west, many small stars,
Three and five in the east.
Rising early and traveling by night,
Toiling in vain.

**Méng**
Ice hides in the northern hills,
The nobleman’s heart grieves.
Bound by meager grain,
Ghosts startle at my gate.

**Xū**
Mountain springs rage violently,
Breaking beams and snapping pillars.
Travelers delay, beset by sorrow,
Lingering in distress.

**Sòng**
A four-winged paired fish
Comes to secure our land.
Fortune and joy ascend the hall,
Sharing my good fortune.
*(See* Sǔn’s *Suí*, *Tóng Rén*’s *Duì*, *Bǐ*’s *Lí.*)*

**Shī**
The swift hare darts,
A fine hound gives chase.
Male and female in flight,
Seized by the hawk.

**Bǐ**
Increasing salary and blessing,
Joy enters the chamber,
Dispelling sorrow and confusion.

**Xiǎo Xù**
Riding dragons and mounting phoenixes,
Ascending to meet the divine lord.
Péng Zǔ receives the needle,
Wáng Qiáo aids in communion.
Wū Xián takes his place,
Bowing for boundless fortune.
*(See* Jiā Rén’s *Bō.*)*

**Lǚ**
Heaven’s fire suddenly rises,
Burning my neighborhood.
Spreading to my home,
Emptying all my wealth.

**Tài**
Gold and silk, yellow treasures,
Fit for my market.
Marriage and trade prosper,
Profit a myriadfold.

**Pǐ**
A dwelling of ghosts and demons,
Inauspicious to stay.

**Tóng Rén**
Flying birds pursue the hare,
Each with its own fear.
Ospreys and hawks turn to thieves,
Disordering my house.

**Dà Yǒu**
Though first alarmed,
Afterward unharmed,
Receiving its blessings.

**Qiān**
Two metals strike,
Courage evenly matched.
Sun and moon clash in battle,
Neither broken nor flawed.

**Yù**
Dragging lines in rivers and seas,
Hanging hooks to catch carp.
The prince’s virtue brings gain,
To feast with Zhòng Fā *(or* Zhòng Yǒu*).*

**Suí**
Dogs fear tigers and wolves,
Seeking human protection.
Three men grasp halberds,
Crouching, daring not rise,
Yet remain safe and blameless.

**Gǔ**
Spiders weave their webs,
Lying in wait for travelers.
Green flies swarm in clusters,
Touching my snares.
Caught in the net,
Dying in its mesh.

**Lín**
What I await lies afar,
The noble charge arrives.
Polishing goblets and washing vessels,
Preparing food in anticipation,
Not for the youngest lord.

**Guān**
Sun and moon dwell together,
Ever dim, never bright.
Lofty mountains crumble,
Hills turn to streams.
*(See* Jiǎn’s *Xián.*)*

**Shì Kè**
Spring garments now complete,
Fresh blossoms bloom anew.
Stalks and leaves flourish thick,
Grains plump in ripened rows.

**Bī**
At Huáshǒu’s mountain peak,
The immortals’ Dao is roamed.
Favorable for dwelling here—
Ever free from blame or woe.

**Bō**
Three foxes wail and weep,
Lamenting loneliness.
No place to wander wild,
They die in barren mounds.

**Fù**
The scorching fire recedes,
Seeking ferns for sustenance.
Merchants fail to arrive,
The market stands empty.

**Wú Wàng**
Alone atop the peak,
Seeking deer to plow the field.
Grasses uncut, trees untamed—
Autumn’s hunger brings no yield.

**Dà Xù**
Though flames rage fierce,
They lie behind.
Though bandits draw near,
They stand to the right.
The self remains secure,
No peril, no fright.

**Guī Mèi** *(to Zhèn)*

**Yí**
Chatter and clamor rise,
Poor ghosts reproach each other.
No peace nor joy is found—
Nine knots tied in a day.

**Fēng** *(to Jìn)*

**Dà Guò**
Pursuing the fleeing foe,
Calling back the young uncle.
Reaching the mountain, he’s found—
Returned now to his home.

**Huàn** *(to Lín)*, **Xū** *(to Huàn)*

**Kǎn**
Bearing orders, shamed by the task,
Unfit to fulfill the duty.
Thus cast aside and fallen,
Made a petty clerk instead.

**Lí**
Adorned with pearls, clasping jade,
Bathed in virtue’s grace.
Answering the call to Táng’s land,
Its four gates serene and bright.
Rebels and thieves do not arise,
All evil hides in flight.

**Xián**
The mechanism jams—
No words may pass.
Yet sincerity prevails,
And man is wronged thereby.

**Héng**
The jar is cracked, the pot is chipped,
Lost on the southern road.
Wandering brings ruin.

**Lǚ**
Lips gone, teeth grow cold,
Roots rot with passing days.
Decayed and useless now—
A plague upon the self.

**Dà Zhuàng**
Bewildered and confused,
Knowing not east nor west.
The Dipper points the way,
Showing my lost center.
Favorable to halt—
Leave the state’s woes behind.

**Jìn**
Crows and magpies beat their wings,
To flee the hidden foe.
Thieves lurk near two maidens,
Yet fate grants them fortune.
Drought brings sickness—
The lord has no millet.

**Míng Yí**
Name achieved, virtue complete,
Yet the neck is never tried.
Duke Jǐng, aged and frail,
Confucius departs.

**Jiā Rén**
Words and heart deceive,
Westward journey, eastward gaze.
Gǔn dammed the floodwaters—
Flattery and treachery wrought disaster.

**Kuí**
Measures defy the rule,
Mustering troops at Jiāo and Huò.
Striking Hào and Fāng,
Contending with Zhōu’s might.
Great war chariots advance—
Decline reaches King Yí.
*(Alternatively: To secure our king.)*

**Jiǎn**
Three fires blaze bright,
Rain quenches their light.
High rank brings swift downfall,
Arrogance invites slaughter.

**Xiè**
Dark streams burst their banks,
Water becomes my curse.
My heart grows bitter,
Mother plants no hemp nor mulberry—
Dwelling here brings peril.

**Sǔn**
Dew soaks the dawn and night,
The path is thick with damp.
My robes and skirts are drenched,
Each step a heavy plight.

**Yì**
Fitting to trade in the market,
All sought is doubled in gain.
Embracing a child with joy,
Profit becomes a friend.

**Dà Guò** *(to Dàn)*, **Xùn** *(to Sǔn)*

**Yāng**
Yin shifts to yang,
Woman transforms to man.
The Dao of governance flows clear,
Lord and minister align. *(Huàn to Lǚ, Fēng to Jié, Zhūn to—)*

**Gòu**
The deep pool hides the male thorn,
A screen of brambles grows by the mountain’s side.
All foes become monks—
Who would welcome me?

**Cuì**
Seated on fine mats, riding grand chariots,
The virtuous minister holds power.
Yu Shu receives the mandate,
And the six directions dwell in harmony.

**Shēng**
Clouds rise to veil the sun,
Rain gathers upon grass and trees—
The year flourishes, the harvest ripens.

**Kùn**
The plum tree’s branches twist and break,
Parting from its mother, severed and unknown.
*(Travel to Great Exceeding.)*

**Jǐng**
Heaven’s drought dries the waters,
Withered and parched, no moisture remains.
Stranded among sand and stone,
No gain is to be had.

**Gé**
Jade tablets and pendants in hand,
He grasps the scepter to meet the king.
The bearded lord of a hundred *li*,
Answering the summons of Qi and Qin.

**Dǐng**
The dragon thirsts for drink,
Dark clouds gather in its wake.
The River Lord proffers sweet wine,
Kneeling to offer the cup—
The flowing stream pours forth abundantly.

**Zhèn**
Hail strikes the plum, its stem falls,
The heart broods in mounting resentment,
Disordering my spirit-qi.

**Gèn**
The deer seeks its fawn
West of the tiger’s den.
Tang Bo and Ji Er—
Greed denies me their consent.
*(Dispersion to Already Fording, Following to Negation.)*

**Jiàn**
Hollowing a gourd to hold water,
The reed-pipe’s mother kindles the fire.
Exhausted, strength spent,
Hunger and thirst bring calamity.

**Guī Mèi**
A dragon born in the horse’s abyss,
Long-lived and divine.
Dwelling in the Xuan Yuan’s halls,
Abiding in joy and enduring peace.

**Fēng**
The towering northern peak,
Heaven’s honored guest.
Warm, benevolent, upright, and just,
The lord bestows virtue’s grace.
Robes and caps never cease—
Heaven’s blessing is received.

**Lǚ**
Ghosts wail in the night,
Qi loses its state,
Betrayed by those below.

**Xùn**
Two governments, many gates,
The lord loses his authority.
Three houses seize control—
Disaster arises from the Ji Sun.

**Duì**
Hoped-for favor does not come,
The literary work remains unfinished.
Three sons chase the hare,
The hound’s quarry slips away.
*(Same as the Dispersion hexagram.)*

**Huàn**
Elder Tiger and Second Bear,
Their virtue and righteousness deep and vast.
They dispatch the Five Teachings,
And yin and yang follow their order.

**Jié**
Two feet, four wings,
Flying into the state and home.
My elder sister finds peace,
Reunited with her mother.

**Zhōng Fú**
Spring and autumn’s prayers and sacrifices
Dissolve misfortune, dispel sorrow—
The lord suffers no disaster.

**Xiǎo Guò**
Tending sheep in the rice fields,
Hearing the tiger’s roar in the thickets.
Trembling in fear, holding breath—
Yet no harm befalls.
*(Splitting to Decrease, Well to Negation, Following to Gradual.)*

**Jì Jì**
Great serpents and giant fish
Wrestle beyond the city walls.
Lord and minister are sundered,
The Duke of Guo leaves his hut.

**Postscript**
Formerly, I saw records by Master Cheng of Shasui, which noted that in the early Shaoxing era, various scholars used the *Yilin* for divining contemporary events with remarkable accuracy, and they sought it for many years. In the Dinghai year of the Baoqing reign, I first obtained the book in Putian, transcribed it, and stored it away. Its verses were ancient and elegant, much like the divination phrases recorded in the *Zuozhuan*. I once tried divining with it, and it proved accurate, though I regretted that it contained many omissions and errors, with no other editions for correction.

In the Gengzi year of the Jiaxi reign, returning from Wumen to Xiaochuan, I happened to meet Prefectural Assistant Magistrate Wang Youdao, who borrowed my family’s copy. Though it also had many omissions and errors, by comparing the two versions, I corrected about eighty or ninety percent. Thus, both our family’s and Wang’s copies became complete. However, there were still many repetitions, with some verses shared by several lines, making verification impossible.

After collation, I returned the book to the Wang family and recorded the corrected version at the end of this volume. Written on the fifth day of the fifth month in the Xinchou year of the Chunyou reign, by Gui Yue of Xizhai.

**Postscript to the *Yilin***
The Dao of the *Yi* encompasses all things, yet scholars grasp only one aspect of it—none can claim it is not the *Yi*. The *Yi* existed in the Xia and Shang dynasties as the Three *Yi*. Later, the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* were lost, leaving only the *Zhouyi* in transmission.

By the Han dynasty, the *Zhouyi* had branched into three schools: the *Yi* of Tian He, the *Yi* of Jiao Gan, and the *Yi* of Fei Zhi. Tian He’s *Yi* was transmitted from Confucius, dividing the text into upper and lower sections, with the Ten Wings as Confucius’ work, complete with chapter-and-verse commentary. Jiao Gan’s *Yi* specialized in divination and observation, as seen in the *Yilin*’s sixteen volumes. Fei Zhi’s *Yi* excelled in hexagram divination, lacking chapter-and-verse commentary, relying solely on images, symbols, and the *Wenyan* to interpret the text within the eight trigrams.

By the end of the Han, the schools of Tian and Jiao had declined, leaving only Fei’s lineage. After Fei, scholars like Zheng Kangcheng and Wang Bi annotated it. In the Song, Cheng Yi of Luoyang based his commentary on Wang Bi’s *Yi*, which derived from Fei’s. Zhu Xi of Huian, following Lü Bogong’s *Ancient Yi*, grounded his *Benyi* in Tian He’s tradition. Thus, the *Yi* of Tian and Fei flourished, while Jiao’s *Yi* alone lacked transmission.

Recently, while examining books in the imperial archives, I discovered the *Yilin*. Its verses and rhymes were beyond later generations’ reach, resembling the divination phrases in the *Zuozhuan*. I transcribed and stored it, and on occasion, used it for divination—it never failed to prove accurate. Could Jiao’s *Yi* truly lack a foundation?

Alas, my shallow learning prevents me from writing a commentary to propagate it, aiding people in seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune. I record this to await a capable scholar. Written on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month in the Guisi year of the Chenghua reign, by the later student Peng Hua of Ancheng.

The *Yi* embodies the four sagely Dao: those who speak value its words, those who act value its changes, those who craft tools value its images, and those who divine value its prognostications. These four are all transformations, the work of the numinous.

I read Jiao’s *Yilin*, which expands the sixty-four hexagrams into four thousand ninety-six, each with its own words, changes, images, and divinations. Its meaning is profound and probing, its language concise and ancient, truly revealing what Fu Xi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius left unsaid, and unlocking the wonders of resolving doubts, achieving tasks, and comprehending aspirations. It is all laid bare upon opening the book.

Before entering office, I always regretted not having seen it. When I governed Wugong, Master Duishan showed it to me. After repeated recitation and reflection, I ordered its printing to broaden its transmission, privately noting the date here. Written in the second month of spring in the fourth year of the Jiajing reign, by Jiang En of Guang’an, on the publication of Jiao’s *Yilin*.

Those who discuss the *Yi* often regard Jiao’s *Yilin* as swift and accurate for divination and observation, yet lament its rarity. Recently, I obtained a copy printed by Prefect Kang of Duishan, entrusted to the magistrate of Wugong, and those who seek it now come in droves.

One day, while attending Military Commissioner Qi of Rongchuan during a judicial inquiry where doubts remained unresolved, he turned to me and said, "If only Jiao Yanshou were here—nothing would escape his detection." I withdrew and performed a divination, obtaining the hexagram *Lawsuit* transforming into *Following*, with the verse:

*"Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding—*
*All return to my court.*
*Three Chou, six sons—*
*Entering the gate, they see their mother."*

Five days later, the case was solved. Upon checking the date, it was the day *yichou*, and those involved in the lawsuit numbered precisely six. Those who heard of this marveled even more at the book, and requests for copies never ceased at my door. Thus, I reprinted it for completion, wishing to guide those who grapple with doubts toward proper action and avoidance, so that Jiao’s *Changes*—long a hidden secret—might once more be widely disseminated. Written on the tenth day of mid-summer in the *jiawu* year of the Jiajing reign, by Ma Lin of Chang’an.
