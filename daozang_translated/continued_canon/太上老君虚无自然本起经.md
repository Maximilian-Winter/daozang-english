**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Scripture on the Primordial Arising of the Void and the Natural**

The Dao is called the Great Beginning. The Great Beginning is the inception of the Dao. At the inception, it was essence—its black and red flourished, becoming radiant light, named the Great Yang. It is also called the Primordial Yang Child Cinnabar. The cinnabar transformed again, becoming the Lord of the Dao. Thus, it is called the inception of the Dao.

Concealed within the Great Simplicity, it became the One. The Great Simplicity is the simplicity of humanity. It refers to the red qi initially transforming into yellow qi, named the Central Harmony. The Central Harmony transformed into the Lord Lao, also becoming the Spirit Lord. Thus, it is called the Yellow Spirit. It entered the bones and flesh, forming the human body. Therefore, it is said that the simplicity of humanity is concealed within the Great Commencement, which is the Two.

The Great Commencement is the inception of qi. It refers to the yellow qi transforming again into white qi. The white qi is the essence of water, named the Great Yin. It transformed into the Lord of Great Harmony. Water emits white qi, thus it is called the inception of qi. This is the Three Qi.

Now, the mutual containment of the Three Inceptions: qi contains spirit, spirit contains essence. Thus, it is said: white contains yellow, yellow contains red, red contains the Three, and the Three contains the One. The Three and the One intermingle, named Chaos. Therefore, the Lord Lao said: "The One generates the Two, the Two generate the Three, and the Three generate the myriad things." It is also said: "Chaos is like a chicken’s egg." This is what is meant.

The human form primarily contains these Three Ones. Thus, it is called the Three Generations, also the Three Essences, and the Three Forms. The Primordial contains spirit, and spirit obtains qi to live. It can activate the form, settle the qi, and thus these Three Matters take root and come to fruition.

Now, the Dao as the Three Ones refers to the Void and the Empty. The Empty is white. White contains Non-Being, Non-Being is yellow, yellow contains red, and red is the Void. What is the Void? The Void is essence—luminous and bright, yet without form or substance. It is like the sun, the moon, and fire: their essence is radiant, yet they have no form or substance. Thus, it is called the Void. What is Non-Being? Non-Being is black. Black has a visible form but no tangible substance. Thus, it is called Non-Being. What is the Empty? The Empty refers to the time before heaven and earth, mountains and rivers existed. Gazing left and right, all was vast and boundless, without obstruction or limit. Only a pervasive whiteness was seen, with nothing to hear. The Dao naturally arose from within it. It is like the explanations of the zither, lute, drum, and flute: because they are hollow within, they produce sound. Therefore, the sages composed scriptures to admonish later worthies, desiring that they guard the Dao, empty their hearts, and seal their ears and eyes, no longer harboring thoughts. If one harbors thoughts and deliberations, one cannot attain the Natural Dao.

Why is this so? Before the Dao transformed into spirit, it had no origin or thread, no mind or intent, utterly without desire or disturbance, unmoving and unshaken. When it transformed into spirit and illumination, the spirit radiated its light externally, perceiving many things, giving rise to mind and intent. Various desires then emerged, further disturbing the original truth. Some say that with thoughts and deliberations, one cannot return to the Dao but instead enters the Five Paths, without respite.

What are the Five Paths?
1. The first path: the spirit ascends to heaven as a celestial spirit.
2. The second path: the spirit enters bones and flesh to become a human spirit.
3. The third path: the spirit enters birds and beasts to become a spirit of birds and beasts.
4. The fourth path: the spirit enters *bili* (a type of hungry ghost).
5. The fifth path: the spirit enters *nili* (a name for hell). Spirits with transgressions enter *nili* to be judged.

These Five Paths each have their kalpas, lifespans, and years. Therefore, the worthy who study the Dao should understand the Void and the Natural. Those who guard the Void attain the Natural Dao and no longer ascend to heaven but remain in the world, transforming and witnessing life and death, becoming teachers of humanity.

Those who guard the spirit can refine their bones and flesh into Perfected Ones, belonging to the celestial offices, and ascend to heaven in flight. This is called the Natural. Those who guard qi can contain the qi of yin and yang, growing feathers and wings to attain the flying immortals’ Dao, named the Lesser Natural. Thus, spirits have breadth and narrowness, knowledge has depth and shallowness, and illumination has greatness and smallness. From this, it is said: studying the Dao, reciting sacred texts, seeking enlightened masters, and dispelling ignorance and darkness.

The method of guarding the Dao requires diligent study of the various scriptures. Reflect inwardly: the spirit of my body originally arose from the Dao. The Dao is pure and tranquil, utterly without possession. It transforms into spirit and illumination, then perceives radiance and generates mind and intent, producing all wisdom.

Wisdom refers to the Five Desires and Six Emotions.
The Five Desires are:
- The ear desires sound, leading to confusion and obstruction, unable to cease.
- The eye desires form, leading to licentiousness and madness.
- The nose desires fragrance, scattering one’s spirit.
- The mouth desires flavor, ensnaring one in nets of transgression.
- The heart desires love and hatred, leading to bias and the loss of impartiality.

All these Five Desires cause delusion and obscuration.

The Six Emotions are:
- The body recognizes pain and itching, desiring softness and smoothness.
- The ear hears sound, and the heart delights in it.
- The eye sees form, and the heart desires it.
- The nose smells fragrance, and the heart pursues the scent.
- The mouth tastes flavor, and the heart rejoices.
- The body obtains soft and smooth clothing, and the heart covets it.
- Obtaining what is loved, the heart is pleased.

Through these Six Emotions, one perishes. Thus, they are also called the Six Emotions that destroy the human spirit. Merely ensnared by these Six Emotions, one becomes deluded, licentious, impure, and obscured, preventing the spirit from flowing freely. The physical person cannot discern, hearing and sight are not keen, emotions and aspirations are blocked. All this is due to the delusion and confusion caused by the Five Desires and Six Emotions. One suffers, transmigrating through the Five Paths of life and death, without respite.

Thus, one must deeply reflect upon this truth: the spirit is originally pure and unsullied, free from these emotions and desires. Merely contemplating this principle causes all desires to cease naturally. When they cease, defilements are entirely purified, and once purified, one becomes clear and unobstructed, clearly perceiving the Dao and uniting with it. Then, hearing and sight become boundless, and transformations occur without constraint.

If one still fails to grasp this, listen to my explanation. Consider, for example, a mirror: when first crafted by the artisan, it is made perfectly clear and bright. Yet when someone buys it and takes it home, neglecting to care for it, it soon loses its reflective luster. Only when the polisher applies medicine and rubs it does it regain its clarity, allowing it to reflect human forms and shadows. The human spirit is the same. The spirit is born from the Dao, and the Dao is pure and clear; thus, the spirit is originally pure. Yet when ensnared by emotions and desires, it falls into darkness and obscurity. Just as a tarnished mirror is polished to restore its brightness, when the human spirit is clouded by desires, one must likewise polish it with the teachings of the scriptures. Only then will desires cease naturally, and purity be restored, allowing true perception.

Or consider the water after a fresh rain—initially turbid and disturbed. If collected in a vessel, it remains muddy at first, unable to reflect anything. Over time, it gradually settles and clears, becoming bright enough to reflect forms and shadows. When the human spirit is disturbed by desires, it is like this muddy water. If one severs these emotions and desires, the spirit becomes like clarified water—naturally pure, clear, and luminous. Once luminous, one attains the Dao.

Those who understand the spirit’s original purity will find desires ceasing naturally. Other teachings, however, fail to recognize this inherent purity and instead constantly urge the suppression of emotions and desires. Yet emotions and desires have no form or substance; they arise unpredictably, unlike tangible objects that can be severed to prevent their return. The thoughts and desires of the spirit emerge without warning, invisible and unknowable, impossible to preempt or block. They cannot be cut off like a dangling thread, shattered like plants or trees, obscured like light, or dammed like a spring. Since the spirit is formless, shifting in an instant across ten thousand barriers, desires cannot be forcibly severed. Only by understanding the spirit’s original purity and freedom from desire will they cease naturally. Without this understanding, attempts to forcibly suppress them will fail, for desires cannot be eradicated in this way.

It is like cutting down a tree to prevent regrowth: one must uproot it entirely. Once the root is removed, the tree will not grow again. The foolish, however, merely chop it down at ground level, leaving the roots to sprout anew. Those who do not comprehend the root of emotions and desires yet forcefully sever their branches will find desires persistently returning, as before. Other teachings, unaware of the spirit’s inherent purity, retreat into seclusion, forcibly blocking ears and eyes to sever desires. Yet they fail to recognize that the root of emotions and desires lies in the heart and mind—the spirit itself. The spirit is formless, moving without constraint, and desires arise from thoughts without warning. Because they are formless, they cannot be severed. Only by understanding their origin will they cease naturally, and thoughts will no longer arise.

To cultivate the Dao, one must thoroughly grasp this principle. Without such clarity, one merely exhausts the spirit in vain. Having understood these emotions and desires, one must also comprehend the methods of practicing the Dao, its virtue, and its path.

The Dao refers to the Way, the *jing* to the path, *xing* to the act of walking, *de* to the merits of virtuous conduct, and *fa* to the scriptures and methods by which one attains the Dao—meaning there is a path to follow and a way to walk. The virtuous, by contemplating and practicing the Ten Virtues through the scriptures, accumulate merit. Once merit is cultivated, one attains the Dao. It is like taking steps along a path to reach the Great Dao. If one remains rigidly seated at home, never taking a step, when will the Dao be attained? If the virtuous do not contemplate the scriptures and practice merit, how can they attain the Dao?

Some believe that merely adhering to the Dao without moving is sufficient, yet without cultivating merit, it is like someone who never leaves home and thus never sees the road. The foolish, though they guard the Dao, fail to practice merit and thus cannot attain it. Therefore, the Most High Lord Lao composed the *Dao Jing* and the *De Jing*, instructing the faithful to uphold and practice them. If merely guarding the Dao were sufficient, why would the sage have composed countless scriptures?

The Dao is completed through three elements, hence it is said that three unite to form virtue. Without all three, nothing is accomplished. The three are the Dao, virtue, and the person. The person is one; by practicing merit, merit becomes the second; and when merit is practiced, the Dao is the third. Only when these three unite can one enter the Dao. If one practices merit but does not understand the Dao, lacking virtue, one cannot attain the Dao. Likewise, if one possesses the Dao and virtue but lacks the person, one still cannot attain it.

It is like planting seeds in fertile soil without water—how can they grow? Or like making wine with yeast and grain but no water—how can it ferment? Or like having a ruler and ministers without people—how can governance occur? Or like having fire and water but no grain—how can one sustain life? Or like having a carriage and horses but no driver—how can they move on their own? All these analogies show that only with the union of three can the Dao be attained.

The Dao comprises three triads in one—forming the Three Ones, the Three Sovereigns, the Three Spirits, and the Three Great Ones. The Three Great Ones are the Upper Great One, the Middle Great One, and the Lower Great One. These constitute the Three Origins, and each of the Three Origins possesses its own Lü-Er-One, thus making three triads in one into nine ones. Hence there are the Nine Palaces, beginning from one and ending at nine. The nine yang qi commence at the winter solstice in the tenth month, arising from beneath the Yellow Springs, and conclude in the sixth month of the new year. From the tenth to the sixth month, spanning nine months, the yang qi reaches its end—thus the yang number is nine, and so too is the reckoning of the Nine Heavens from midnight to noon. To comprehend the Dao, one must understand these nine transformations of the ones, their cyclical ascent and descent.

The great person’s form is one, spirit is two, and the black is three—this three-in-one triad completes the human being. Again, spirit is one, the black is two, and essence is three—this three-in-one triad completes the spirit. Further, heaven is one, earth is two, and humanity is three—this three-in-one triad constitutes the root of virtue, power, heaven, and earth.

The Three Ones refer to the Void as one. Within the Void, the self naturally establishes its body—this is also the Lord of the Dao, the Primordial Yang Master of the Elixir, the Noble Person, and the Divine Person. The leftward one is also heaven, the sun, the father, the yang, attainment, the teacher, and the hun-soul, governing governance for humanity. The rightward one is also earth, the moon, the mother, the yin, form, the Controller of Destiny, the demonic, and the devil, presiding over evil and corruption in humanity. The wise must discern these three triads in one, distinguishing good from evil, uprightness from perversity. One who awakens to this can attain the Dao.

In practicing the Dao, one must understand the left and right ones as teachings of good and evil. The central one, the upright spirit within the self, is the disciple of the Dao. The left and right ones serve as assistants, guiding toward good or evil. The leftward one daily urges and admonishes me toward goodness, and as merits accumulate daily, one aligns with the true Dao. The rightward one, if unchecked, reverses its course to oppose me, preventing me from succumbing to evil. Yet the rightward one daily instructs and tempts me toward wickedness, dragging me deeper into depravity, thereby becoming aligned with evil. The rightward one, being of the demonic, daily consorts with evil. The wise who seek the Dao but merely understand its principles without practicing merit will belong to the demonic, unable to escape its realm. The demonic brings confusion and chaos, plunging one into darkness, rage, and delusion. Demonic spirits and ghosts daily draw near, and the unenlightened, in their forced stillness—sealing ears and eyes to sever desires—are instead violated and disturbed. Evil thoughts arise ceaselessly, one after another, without respite.

For those of merit, when entering stillness, the leftward one prevents demonic interference. Thus, without merit, forcing stillness to sever desires only invites demonic disruption, leaving the heart unsettled. The natural Dao consists of three, modeled on the Great Void. Those of profound learning and merit, who grasp the root of the Dao, penetrate its subtle mysteries, and comprehend the transformations of the Three Origins and Nine Ones—the mystery within mystery, the primordial Dao of Non-Being within Non-Being—know its beginning and perceive its end. Heaven, earth, and humanity each possess form; as form exists, there is formation and dissolution, life and death. Spirit, being formless, endlessly transforms and thus knows no cessation—hence it is everlasting. Unconfused by worldly hearsay, unmisled by worldly knowledge, one who clearly perceives the naturalness of the Void becomes serene and untroubled, free from sorrow or joy, unshaken by desires.

Why is this so? Such a person understands the root and is not deluded by its branches. They merely share the inner form of others, yet their wisdom is boundless—this is the Void. This understanding comes through learning, not innate naturalness. When cultivating stillness in the Dao, one should eat sparingly, close the ears and eyes, return the spirit’s radiance to the Crimson Palace, and extinguish all thoughts, refraining from forced contemplation. Gradually, breathing becomes subtle, until one no longer perceives it, utterly unaware of the body’s presence or absence. From this arises the gateway to the stabilized Dao.

The Dao is the Void. When revealed, the spirit ascends to the Void above, gazing left and right—all is luminous and pure white, with nothing visible. It resembles a snowfall, where trees, mountains, and earth are all white, everything indistinct. Why? The spirit, having emerged above heaven, gazes forward yet no longer sees the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, or seas. This is the return to life and the reversion to the Dao, merging back into the Void. Upon attaining this, one should look downward to perceive all worldly affairs, then recall the master’s teachings: the Dao is for delivering and guiding the world. At this thought, the prior vision of whiteness ceases, and the spirit, once more obscured, returns to the body. Without this, the spirit enters the Dao, scattering the form to unite with it, becoming the flesh and bones of the world, leaving no trace. Thus, Laozi said: "Know the white, guard the black, to be the world’s model." This means the spirit returns to the body, abiding in the world as a teacher of the Dao—this is the great naturalness of the Void.

The leftward one daily admonishes me toward goodness, and as merits flourish, one aligns with the true Dao. The rightward one, if unchecked, reverses to oppose me, preventing evil. Yet it daily tempts me toward wickedness, deepening corruption, aligning with evil. The wise who seek the Dao but merely understand it without practicing merit will belong to the demonic, unable to escape its realm. The demonic brings confusion, plunging one into darkness and delusion. Without merit, forcing stillness to sever desires only invites demonic disruption, leaving the heart unsettled. The natural Dao, modeled on the Great Void, is grasped by those of profound learning and merit who comprehend its root, penetrate its mysteries, and know the transformations of the Three Origins and Nine Ones—the mystery within mystery, the primordial Dao of Non-Being. Knowing its beginning and end, they see that heaven, earth, and humanity each possess form, subject to formation and dissolution, life and death. Spirit, being formless, endlessly transforms—hence it is everlasting. Unconfused by worldly hearsay, unmisled by worldly knowledge, they perceive the naturalness of the Void, becoming serene and untroubled, unshaken by desires.

When cultivating stillness, one should eat sparingly, close the senses, return the spirit’s radiance to the Crimson Palace, and extinguish all thoughts. Breathing gradually becomes imperceptible, and one loses awareness of the body’s presence or absence—this is the gateway to the stabilized Dao. The Dao is the Void. When the spirit ascends to the Void above, all appears luminous and white, with nothing visible. The spirit, having emerged above heaven, no longer sees the sun, moon, or earthly forms—this is the return to the Dao. Looking downward, one perceives worldly affairs, then recalls the master’s teaching: the Dao is for delivering the world. At this thought, the vision of whiteness ceases, and the spirit returns to the body. Without this, the spirit unites with the Dao, scattering the form, leaving no trace. Thus, Laozi’s words: "Know the white, guard the black, to be the world’s model." The spirit returns to the body, abiding in the world as a teacher of the Dao—this is the great naturalness of the Void.

The method of guarding the Center’s naturalness—if one cannot comprehend the origin of heaven, earth, and all beings, cannot fathom the root-source and transformations of the Dao, and cannot attain knowledge of the affairs of emptiness and void, then what one sees and hears will only breed doubt and wonder. One remains ignorant, sitting alone, unable to generate the natural. One merely receives the master’s teaching, which instructs that to guard the spirit within the body, one must also eliminate passions and desires, seal the ears and eyes, and return the spirit to the Crimson Palace. Gazing downward, one beholds Mount Kunlun. Some teachings command the spirit to ascend Kunlun, where, upon looking upward, one envisions the Central Yellow Dao Lord within. At first, one meets only briefly, but with time, the vision endures, and eventually, all the gods appear, speaking with the spirit, discoursing on celestial matters. Worldly thoughts vanish entirely. The bones, marrow, and blood within the body daily transform, becoming a host of mighty spirits. Together, they lift the body to ascend to heaven, where it receives celestial appointment and registration, never to descend among humans again. This is the Way of the Perfected, called the naturalness of the Central Void.

The method of guarding the Lesser Void’s naturalness also requires eliminating passions and desires, sealing the ears and eyes, and returning the spirit to the Crimson Palace. Gazing downward at Mount Kunlun, one harmonizes the qi of heaven and earth, sun and moon, yin and yang, female and male, hun and po, to nourish the Perfected. As the body’s yin and yang congeal and its essence-bones become lustrous, feathers grow, and one soars to the Five Sacred Mountains. Occasionally, one may be sent on missions to traverse the human realm, though one cannot remain long. This is the naturalness of the Lesser Void.

Below the Great Void, the Central Void, and the Lesser Void, there are the methods of *youwei* and *wuwei*. *Youwei* refers to circulating through the viscera, guiding and pulling, mobilizing the various qi, refining elixirs, compounding medicines, swallowing talismans, kneeling in worship, wearing seals, observing prohibitions, aligning with auspicious days and hours, performing rituals, invoking the names of spirits, and divining omens. This is *youwei*—those who practice it do not comprehend the Dao. Some may attain immortality, some may prolong their years, and some may achieve *shijie* (corpse-liberation). Below this, one enters the ghostly path, not true longevity.

Those who attain the Dao of the Great Void’s naturalness do not belong to heaven but to the Dao Lord alone. They can disperse their form to merge with the Dao, transform at will, hear and see without limit, and act wherever they please. To obtain this Dao, one must practice the teachings, transform through virtue, uphold the precepts of the scriptures, equalize the mind, abandon all attachments, treat all equally without favor or bias, and refrain from killing. Why? Because all creatures—from the flying to the creeping—are manifestations of the Great Void’s image. Those who understand the Dao yet kill bring harm upon themselves; thus, it is forbidden.

Those who guard the Center’s naturalness, however, guard the spirit of the Center, which still involves some killing. Why? The spirit possesses emptiness, and within emptiness, there is form. Thus, there is eating, killing, and sacrificial offerings. The Dao has none, so it requires no sacrifices and no killing.

Those who attain the Dao can only perceive what they have already obtained. The human ears and eyes hear sounds and see forms but cannot hear or see the formless and soundless. Why? The spirit is red, red—yang, yang—rising high as the sun and the eyes. It can only see what is before it, not behind, nor above its own head. The sun is heaven’s eye: it can illuminate within heaven but not beyond, nor can it penetrate the depths of darkness. Thus, those who ascend to heaven through the spirit’s Way can only hear with heaven’s ears.

The Dao’s ears and eyes hear and see without front or back, without darkness or obstruction, perceiving all affairs across countless heavens. They can hear the soundless and see the formless. Those who cultivate the immortal’s Way must deliberately employ heaven’s ears and eyes to perceive. If they do not, they will only see what lies before them. Why? The immortal’s bones and flesh have departed.

To know the spirit, one must nurture its image. The spirit is but a radiance, a void-form, like the reflection seen in a mirror or water—nothing substantial. Its abode is always in heaven as a living lord, its lifespan measured in kalpas, never dwelling among humans. When its celestial lifespan ends, it reenters the Five Paths, cycling through birth and death as before. Sometimes, when its lifespan ends, it merges with the Dao and vanishes.

The Perfected possess form and shadow, belong to heaven, and undergo transformations. Their lifespans number in the tens of thousands, and they govern in heaven, occasionally sent on missions to the human realm. When their celestial lifespan ends, they may ascend to become *xuan* spirit-people, never again entering the Five Paths to undergo birth and death.

Those who guard the Great Void and attain the Dao of naturalness dwell in heaven for thousands of kalpas. When their lifespan ends, their transformations cease, and their spirit dissipates. The spirit then reenters the Five Paths, cycling through birth and death as before. Heavenly spirits do not experience death and birth but merely traverse the Five Paths. Only their traces remain, their wisdom and spirit ever aware. Like fire extinguished, nothing remains. Thus, those who merge with the Dao—why does their spirit perish? This occurs because Daoists fail to understand that the Dao’s root is emptiness and stillness. Fixating on emptiness, they cause the spirit to dissipate entirely.

Those who guard the spirit do not comprehend the Dao’s root in emptiness and stillness. They trust only in existence, not in nonexistence, thus guarding the spirit as if guarding something real, becoming attached and unable to return to the Dao. Why? The spirit cycles endlessly through the Five Paths, never perishing. Only through good analogies and the greatest awakening can one understand that the Dao’s root is emptiness and stillness. One neither guards existence nor emptiness, neither clings to reality nor void. Abiding within the Three Realms, one cultivates a heart of compassion, desiring to deliver all beings from suffering. One refuses to enter emptiness to merge with the Dao. Through such merit and virtue, one naturally attains the Dao, which has no lifespan, never reenters the Five Paths, and neither perishes nor endures forever. When one’s merit is complete, one may succeed the Dao Lord.

The worthy who pursue the Dao must thoroughly comprehend this meaning, knowing that superiority and inferiority each have their own attainments. When the worthy study the Dao, if they grasp only the branches and leaves, believing themselves deeply accomplished, and refuse to further inquire or exhaustively investigate its profound depths, this is not knowing the Dao. Each follows their own path, leading to varying degrees of penetration into its subtleties and wonders. Upon hearing of immortals, they claim to have attained the Dao. The worthy who study the Dao are like those who climb a mountain and look down, declaring their path the highest, only to reach the summit and find yet higher peaks ahead. Standing atop the highest peak, they still see loftier heights beyond. The study of the Dao is likewise: learning from a minor master, one advances to a middling master, and only upon encountering a great master does one grasp the Dao’s root and origin. Thus, learning must never be called complete. One must strive to seek an enlightened master and bitterly devote oneself to the Dao. Why settle for the lesser Way when the great Dao lies before you? To halt at minor attainments is to remain in darkness and near-sightedness.

The worthy who study the Dao yet do not broadly hear, deeply see, or consult many masters—such a person’s learning is not worth mentioning. If the sun and moon are not high, their illumination does not reach far; if rivers and seas are not vast, they cannot contain and embrace all. Those who emerge as renowned scholars of the Dao are like fish in a pond, swimming to the limits of their confined waters, believing they have exhausted all the waters under heaven. Day and night, they cannot converse with the great fish of the vast waters, unaware that beyond their pond lie the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow River, and the boundless seas. It is like a fool in the deep mountains who, from birth to old age, never ventures out, seeing and hearing nothing, and thus remains ignorant of the learning, customs, hierarchies, carriages, clothing, delicacies, and fragrances of those beyond the mountains.

Or like scholars of the classics who have only heard that the Nine Provinces share one Son of Heaven, and that beyond the four borders lie only barbarians, believing the edges of heaven and earth end there—how could they know what lies beyond? The study of the Dao is the same: receiving teachings from a master, one assumes they have exhausted it, unaware that the writings on cultivating the Dao and its practices cannot be fully recorded.

Those who study immortal arts, believing themselves complete, assured of ascending as flying immortals to heaven, only then realize their knowledge falls short of a true person. Those who study the Way of the true person, believing themselves complete, assured of becoming a true person, only then realize their knowledge falls short of a spirit person. Those who study the Way of the spirit person, believing themselves complete, assured of becoming a spirit person, only then realize their knowledge falls short of the great Dao. Even within the attainment of the great Dao, there are gradations of honor and humility, for knowledge is not equal. Thus, learning has no end. Even heavenly spirits follow behind, learning the Dao from their lords—how much more so for those who govern inner realms, extinguishing the spirit, and manifesting transformations, each with their own dominion and entry, each with their own governance.

Those who cultivate the great Dao of emptiness and nothingness attain formlessness and soundlessness, teaching without thought, desire, or the impulse of recognition. Even when guarding the time, one follows the method and teachings of the Dao, not seeking omens in visions or dreams. Though spirits may appear, one must not converse with them. Why? Some spirits may be demonic, testing the practitioner. In this state of formlessness, one naturally seeks the Dao, not spirits. By relinquishing the small to grasp the great, one may attain the natural state.

Lord Lao said: "There is light, yet it does not shine," meaning one should nurture their luminosity until it penetrates all, not allowing fleeting flashes of brilliance to appear solely to a single spirit. In this way, one cannot perceive all matters under heaven.

The *Scripture on the Spontaneous Arising of the Root of Emptiness and Nothingness of the Most High Lord Lao* concludes.
